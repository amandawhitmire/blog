Professor Johnson made some \n\n remarks in relation to the apparent tendency of Anthracite \n\n coal to assume crystalline forms ; and exhibited a specimen \n\n of the rhombic form. \n\n\n\nProfessor H. D. Rogers observed, that in his explora- \n\n tions of the coal formations of Pennsylvania, he found he \n\n could trace this tendency to three mechanical causes, viz : \n\n 1st. to planes of deposition ; 2dly. to transverse planes or \n\n joints ; 3dly. to faults. \n\n\n\nBy special permission, Prof. Johnson in the chair, \n\n Dr. S. G. Morton made some observations on a mode of ascer- \n\n taining the internal capacity of the human cranium, by means of \n\n the tin tube and graduated rod, as described by him in Crania \n\n Americana, page 283. \n\n\n\nThe materia] hitherto used by Dr. Morton for the purpose of \n\n filling the crania, was white pepper seed, which was selected on \n\n account of its spherical form, and the general uniformity in the size \n\n of the grains ; in these respects, however, there is sufficient diversity \n\n to occasion considerable variation in the results of several succes- \n\n sive measurements of the same head, especially when taken by \n\n\n\n-.-.. \n\n\n\n.ft -*-* \n\n\n\n", 
"8 [April, 1841. \n\n\n\ndifferent persons. This variation was sometimes not less than \n\n three or four cubic inches ; making it desirable to use some other \n\n bodies in place of the pepper seeds. Dr. Morton then tried leaden \n\n shot of the size called BB., measuring of an inch in diameter ; \n\n which being perfectly smooth and spherical, of uniform size, and \n\n therefore not liable, like the seeds, to variations from packing, were \n\n found to answer the purpose in every particular. In using the shot, \n\n it is necessary to fill the skull completely, by shaking it, and by \n\n pressing the shot down with the finger and the end of the funnel \n\n introduced into the foramen magnum, until all the cavities and \n\n sinuosities are filled. When this is accomplished, the shot being \n\n transferred to the tube, will give the capacity of the cranium in \n\n cubic inches, and with so much accuracy, that in six successive \n\n measurements of the same skull, the results did not vary more than \n\n half a cubic inch ; a degree of accuracy which has not been at- \n\n tained by any former method. An experiment with the apparatus \n\n was then made, in the presence of the members, which corroborated \n\n the statements already made. Dr. Morton informed the Society, \n\n that he was now engaged in ascertaining by these means, the ca- \n\n pacity of the cranium, as indicative of the size of the brain, in the \n\n different races of men, and will report the results for publication in \n\n the proceedings of the Academy. \n\n\n\nSTATED MEETING, Apkil 13. \n\n Vice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nDONATIONS TO MUSEUM. \n\n\n\nA specimen of Mountain Leather, from New Brunswick, N. \n\n Jersey.

From the Author. \n\n\n\nProfessor Johnson offered some observations on the me- \n\n chanical structure of Coal, with evidences of the contempo- \n\n raneous origin of its various kinds. \n\n\n\nThe question of the identity and contemporaneousness of the \n\n two great divisions of the coal measures of Pennsylvania, has \n\n sometimes occupied the attention of geologists. A similar question \n\n is occasionally agitated in Europe, in reference to the Anthracite \n\n and Bituminous coal fields of that quarter of the world. \n\n\n\nAmong the arguments in favour of the contemporaneous deposi- \n\n tion of the coal in the two regions, those which are derived from \n\n the similarity of the accompanying measures or members of the \n\n coal series in the two regions, and the resemblance or identity of \n\n the fossil organic remains accompanying the coal in both cases, are \n\n not the least weighty. The presence of large bodies of carbonate \n\n of iron interposed among the coal beds in both coal districts, is an \n\n analogous circumstance strongly corroborative of the opinion that \n\n both varieties of coal were produced under circumstances at least \n\n strongly resembling each other. \n\n\n\nAnother circumstance favourable to the supposed similarity of \n\n circumstances which accompanied the deposition of anthracite and \n\n bituminous coal, is the resemblance in mechanical structure of the \n\n two kinds. This may, at the first enunciation, seem somewhat \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\ni\\ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", 
"10 April, 1841.] \n\n\n\nstartling ; especially since the terms heavy, hard and tough, are \n\n generally applied to the one, and light, soft and friable or tender, to \n\n the other. It is nevertheless true, that strong mechanical resem- \n\n blances exist ; and the more minutely we examine the two varieties, \n\n the more shall we be impressed with the conviction of the import- \n\n ance of the resemblance. \n\n\n\nIn the first place, the coal of all coal measures has a series of \n\n partings parallel to the floor or bottom of the bed on which it rests, \n\n and to the cover or roofing under which it lies. These are as dis- \n\n tinct in inclined and vertical beds as in those which still remain \n\n horizontal. \n\n\n\nIn the second place, the connection between the coal and its under- \n\n lying slate, as well as with its top slate, is so definite and well under- \n\n stood, that it serves to determine the true original position of coal \n\n beds, which have been so far disturbed as to be turned nearly up- \n\n side down ; of which examples are not wanting. These character- \n\n istics are found in beds of both kinds of coal. \n\n\n\nIn the third place, there is most commonly a fracture or division \n\n of the coal in some direction (which, for the same bed, is gene- \n\n rally continuous,) and nearly at right angles to the planes of de- \n\n position. \n\n\n\nFourth, a third series of divisions by vertical planes, called cross \n\n partings, inclined to the last mentioned. This system of planes is \n\n not always continuous throughout the bed, but varies in the differ- \n\n ent plies. \n\n\n\nThe principal vertical divisions are known to miners by the \n\n names of \"cleats\" or \" slines,\" and sometimes by that of \"grains.\" \n\n The direction in which these run, seems to determine the manner \n\n of working out the coal ; for in attempting to separate large masses \n\n from their natural position by means of wedges, it is only in the \n\n direction of the cleats that the separation can take place. In in- \n\n clined beds, from which the coal is to be extracted by a slope or \n\n rail-road laid down on the floor of the bed, it is a great convenience \n\n to have the cleat lie in a direction diametrically across that of the \n\n slope, or in conformity with the strike of the bed ; for then in run- \n\n ning a drift from the bottom of the slope horizontally along the bed, \n\n and afterwards carrying the workings upward, the cleat will always \n\n face the miner, and he will be enabled to obtain heavy falls of coal \n\n by undermining and wedging down. \n\n\n\n", 
"April, 1841.] 11 \n\n\n\nIn most bituminous coals, and in not a few anthracites, the \n\n \"cleavage of the laminae,\" or what I have chosen to call surfaces \n\n of deposition, are sufficiently distinct, and afford ready partings to \n\n separate masses into small pieces. In some of the harder anthra- \n\n cites, however, these surfaces are nearly obliterated, being dis- \n\n tinguishable only by different shades of black. The actual cleava- \n\n ges of the coal, in such instances, seldom take place along the sur- \n\n face of deposition ; but on igniting the specimen, we may generally \n\n obtain partings in those natural seams. I exhibit an example in \n\n coal of Hazleton. \n\n\n\nThe regular slines also, in anthracite, are sometimes so far ob- \n\n literated as to be only developed by strong heat or partial combus- \n\n tion. They are then shown by the thin, white, shining lamina? of \n\n earthy matter, which mark two opposite sides of a lump of half \n\n burnt coal. \n\n\n\nThe absolute direction of the cleat is very various. At the Lau- \n\n rel Hill mines, in Hazle creek valley, it is believed to be about \n\n north 80 east. \n\n\n\nIn some beds of coal which I discovered and examined on the \n\n West Branch of the Susquehanna, it is due east and west by com- \n\n pass. \n\n\n\nIn the Middleton mine coal, in the Northerly part of England, it \n\n is from N. 20 West to N. 32 W. \n\n\n\nThe second, or \" short cleat,\" in opposition to the \" long cleat,\" \n\n which extends for great distances, is the cross parting already \n\n spoken of, and not unfrequently runs perpendicularly to the direc- \n\n tions of both the \" cleavage of the lamina? and to the long cleat.\" \n\n This is seen both in bituminous coals and anthracites. \n\n\n\nAnother circumstance to which I would refer, as indicative of the \n\n similarity of origin and correspondence in character, between bi- \n\n tuminous coals and anthracites, is the correspondence of the two, \n\n in respect to the composition of the ashes of the two kinds. Silica, \n\n alumina, oxide of iron, with small amounts of lime, magnesia, and \n\n occasionally of oxide of manganese, are the ingredients of the ashes \n\n of both the kinds of coal. The proportions vary, not only in the \n\n different kinds of coal, but also in the several plies of the same bed, \n\n both in the bituminous and anthracite districts. In the anthracite, \n\n the diversity of composition is marked by the colour of the different \n\n streaks after partial incineration. \n\n\n\n", 
"12 [April, 1S41- \n\n\n\nAnother resemblance between the two kinds is that in the an- \n\n thracite beds, spaces partially vacant are found to contain masses, \n\n with a puffy aspect on the exterior, so strongly resembling coke, \n\n that it might be difficult at the first glance to distinguish a fragment \n\n of it from a piece of artificial coke. Natural coke is also found in \n\n connection with beds of bituminous coal, especially where the latter \n\n are in close proximity with primitive strata as in the mines of \n\n Virginia. \n\n\n\nWhen coal contains a large proportion of earthy matter, and is \n\n deposited in thin lamince, it will, in the state of anthracite, be found \n\n to part with great difficulty in the direction of the surfaces of depo- \n\n sition. It will then be seen to give fractures, developing a multi- \n\n tude of small conchoidal surfaces, This is by the miners termed \n\n bony coal ; and that it well deserves its name may be evinced by \n\n its actually being so hard as sometimes to strike fire with steel. \n\n\n\nCoal occasionally assumes the appearance of well defined rhombic \n\n prisms and octaedra, occasionally with striated surfaces, in which \n\n cases, though the cleavages be difficult and obscure, they are never- \n\n theless practicable. \n\n\n\n",

"May, 1S41.] 15 \n\n\n\nDr. Morton (Professor Johnson taking the chair) exhibited \n\n the embalmed body of an Egyptian Ibis, Ibis religiosa, which \n\n was unwrapped by him in the Hall of the Academy, on the \n\n 10th of April, in the presence of many members and others. \n\n\n\nThis specimen was one of several sent to Dr. Morton by \n\n George R. Gliddon, Esq., United States Consul at Cairo. It \n\n was obtained at Saccara, and is probably two thousand five hun- \n\n dred years old. The bird was enveloped in nearly one hundred \n\n and fifty folds of the usual linen mummy-cloth, and was found to \n\n be in perfect preservation; the head being extended downwards \n\n between the legs, and the latter drawn up, with the toes pointing \n\n outward: the feathers were generally uninjured, retaining much \n\n of their original colour ; and it may be confidently asserted, that \n\n this is one of the most perfect examples of the art of bird-embalm- \n\n ing which has ever been submitted to the inspection of natu- \n\n ralists. \n\n\n\nThe Ibis, [Ibis religiosa,) as a sacred bird, was fed and wor- \n\n shipped in the Egyptian temples ; yet it is difficult to imagine in \n\n what way they were obtained in such vast numbers as are now \n\n found embalmed in the pyramids of Saccara. For example, \n\n Pococke, who travelled in Egypt upwards of a century since, \n\n expressed a fear that the embalmed Ibis would soon become \n\n extinct, in consequence of the daily and wanton destruction of \n\n the jars in which they are embalmed ; and yet travellers of our \n\n own times assure us, after all this protracted devastation, that \n\n thousands of these relics remain undisturbed in the pyramids. \n\n\n\nThe motive for worshipping the Ibis has been variously ex- \n\n plained ; but the true cause was, no doubt, the appearance of this \n\n bird (which is a native of Abyssinia) during the inundation of the \n\n Nile, and its departure to the south on the subsidence of the \n\n water; for the Egyptians rendered homage to every thing which \n\n was connected with a phenomenon on which depended all their \n\n hopes of health, plenty, and happiness. \n\n\n\nDr. Morton adverted again to the fact, mentioned at a former \n\n meeting, that on first opening one of these Ibis-jars, the wrappings, \n\n which were beautifully adjusted, were almost, if not entirely \n\n colourless; but that in a short time they assumed the dark brown \n\n colour which the bitumen usually imparts to the mummy-cloth. \n\n\n\n", 
"16 [May, 1841. \n\n\n\nProf. Johnson suggested that the exterior wrappings might not \n\n have heen originally saturated with bitumen, but that they had \n\n been applied while clean to the mummy wrapped in the interior \n\n saturated folds ; and that by slow, insensible transmission, the \n\n clean folds had, with the volatilized bituminous matter, become in \n\n a manner photogenic, and capable of being turned yellow by the \n\n influence of light as soon as the jars were opened. He con- \n\n ceived this explanation of the phenomenon by the known agency \n\n of light on resinous and bituminous substances, more satisfactory \n\n than that which had been previously offered, and which ascribed \n\n it to the mere presence of air admitted on opening the jar. He \n\n suggested that the latter explanation Avouid have had more plau- \n\n sibility if the jar had really been hermetically sealed, and air \n\n tight; which,- from its texture, being that of coarse unglazed \n\n earthenware, and particularly from the covering of its mouth \n\n being a still more coarse unburnt mortar, could not be presumed \n\n to be the fact. \n\n\n\nDr. Goddard admitted the action of light, in explaining the \n\n phenomenon in question ; but as he supposed the cloth to have \n\n been originally of a yellow or brownish colour, such as it assumes \n\n on being removed from the jar, he considered the presence of \n\n bitumen not necessary to the change. He cited, in illustration, \n\n the Cartoons of Raphael, which, having faded in a moderately \n\n lighted room, were subsequently restored to their original colours \n\n by exposure to the sun's rays. \n\n\n\nSome further observations ensued on the action of light, and \n\n its effects in bleaching resins. \n\n\n\n",

"18 [Mat, 1841. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Insects brought home by Commander James \n\n Clarke Ross, R. N. By John Curtis, Esq., F. L. S. 4to. \n\n From the Author. \n\n\n\nWritten Communications. A communication was read \n\n from Dr. A. Clapp, of New Albany, Indiana, in reference to \n\n the Geological equivalents of that vicinity, as compared by him \n\n with those described in the Silurian System of Murchison. \n\n\n\n\" The following fossils, which characterize the Wenlock Lime- \n\n stone of Murchison, I have found in the Limestone of the Falls of \n\n the Ohio: Favosites spongites, Retepora prisca. Acervularia \n\n Baltica, Astrea ananas? Cyathophyllum turbinatum, Syringipora \n\n reticulata, Calymene bufo. \n\n\n\n\"I have also observed, at the same place, the following group \n\n of Wenlock fossils, which, however, are not characteristic of the \n\n Limestone of the Falls : Catenipora escharoides, Syringipora \n\n bifurcata, Stomatapora concentrica, Favosites C4othlandica, \n\n Turbinalapsis bina, Strophomena euglypha? Atrypa prisca. \n\n To Avhich I may add the following fossils of Goldfuss, which are \n\n not found in the Wenlock Limestone, and some of them not even \n\n in Wales: Cyathophyllum ceratites, C. vermiculare, and C. \n\n helianthoides, Stomatopora polymorpha, Favosites polymorpha, \n\n and F. basallica, Gorgonia infundibuliformis? the last being more \n\n common in the latter formations. (Ludlow.) Besides the preced- \n\n ing species, I have many Polyparia, and some shells of the Falls \n\n Limestone yet undetermined. In the Limestone and Marls of \n\n Madison and Hanover, in Indiana, I have identified two other \n\n species belonging to the Wenlock shale, viz.: Terebratula \n\n spherica? and Orthocera eccentrics. \n\n\n\nThe middle and lower strata of the Blue Limestone and Marls \n\n at Cincinnati, and the lowest at Madison and Hanover, appear to \n\n be equivalents of the Caradoc Group of Murchison, and contain \n\n the following fossils: Orthis callactis, Calymene punctata, C. \n\n Blumenbachii, Triarthus Beckii, Isotelus , Pentacrinit.es prisca, \n\n (Goldf.) This formation has very few Polyparia, but many \n\n shells, which are different from any described by Goldfuss or \n\n Murchison. \n\n\n\n\" The black bituminous slate that overlies the limestone at the \n\n\n\n", 
"May, 1841.] 19 \n\n\n\nfoot of the Falls, and is found in many parts of the western coun- \n\n try, is probably the equivalent of the Marcellus Shale of New \n\n York. This is an excellent landmark, as there is no other for- \n\n mation in the west that can be easily mistaken for it. The situation \n\n of this slate at the Falls has been misunderstood in some instances, \n\n and described as underlying, or beneath the limestone. \n\n\n\n\"The dividing line between the upper and lower Silurian \n\n groups, (Wenlock Shale and Caradoc rocks,) appears to have no \n\n distinct lithological demarcation in our western formations; yet \n\n this line will probably be found to occur in the upper series of \n\n the Cincinnati and Madison Blue Limestones and Marls.\" \n\n\n\nMr. T. A. Conrad submitted a description of three new \n\n species of Unio, from the rivers of the United States, viz.: \n\n\n\n1. Unio perplicatus. Obtusely subovate, very ventricose; rather \n\n thick, with about 12 oblique, profound plica?, those behind the \n\n umbo recurved ; ligament margin greatly elevated ; posterior \n\n superior margin slightly concave, oblique, extremity truncated ; \n\n epidermis blackish-brown, apex erobed ; within tinged with \n\n purple; cardinal teeth direct, prominent, sulcated. (Length \n\n 2.4; height 1.3; diameter 1.9.) \n\n\n\nThis species is most nearly related to U. costatus, (Raf.) but \n\n differs in being far more ventricose, and has very prominent urn- \n\n bones, which are just the reverse in the costatus. The diameter \n\n through the umbonial slope is profound. \n\n\n\n2. U. nodiferus. Obtusely subovate, ventricose, moderately \n\n thick; surface with a few nodules about the middle of the \n\n valves, and smaller ones near the ligament margin ; a slight, \n\n not very wide, furrow extends from beak to base; posterior \n\n margin approaching to a regular curve; beaks eroded; within \n\n white ; cardinal teeth robust, prominent, direct, and profoundly \n\n sulcated in old shells; epidermis chestnut-brown. (Length \n\n 2.1, 1.8; height 1.1, 1; diameter 1.6, 1.4.) \n\n\n\nApproaches U. prasinus, but differs in being proportionally \n\n longer, more convex, in having a brown epidermis, narrower \n\n anterior side, and oblique posterior margin. \n\n\n\n", 
"20 [May, 1841. \n\n\n\n3. U. paralellus. Oblong 1 , sub-rhomboidal, convex, moderately \n\n\n\nthick, slightly contracted from beak to base ; hinge and basal \n\n\n\nmargins parallel, nearly rectilinear; posterior margin oblique; \n\n\n\nextremity obtusely rounded; epidermis dark olive-brown; \n\n\n\nwithin white; cardinal teeth oblique, double in each valve ; \n\n\n\ncardinal area under the beaks almost obliterated. (Length \n\n\n\n3.7; height 1.1; diameter 1.8.) \n\n\n\nSome' conchologists may consider this to be a variety of U. \n\n purpureus, (Say,) and as but one specimen has been received, I \n\n cannot judge of the amount of difference which will obtain be- \n\n tween the two species. I think the purpureus has never yet \n\n been found nearly so far south-west as Louisiana; certainly, \n\n after a long examination of the waters of Alabama, I was unable \n\n to find it. The paralellus differs from purpureus in having a \n\n white interior, in the obliteration of the cardinal area, in the regular \n\n convexity of the valves, and in having a much larger accessory \n\n muscular impression. \n\n\n\nThese three species are in the collection of the Academy: they \n\n were sent from Jackson, in Louisiana. \n\n\n\nSTATED MEETING, May 18, 1841. \n\n Vice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nDONATIONS TO MUSEUM. \n\n\n\nHelix Blandingiana ; St. Johns, Liberia.

"34 [June, 1841. \n\n\n\nTo observe the time and degree of rapidity of resuming the mag- \n\n netic power by a mass of melted iron, a bed was formed about 3 or \n\n 3 1-2 feet in length, 5 inches deep, and of the usual form for cast- \n\n ing pig iron ; rounding at the bottom and 4 or 5 inches broad at \n\n the top. The length of this bed was nearly in the direction of the \n\n magnetic meridian. \n\n\n\nA compass needle 3 inches long was placed near the northern \n\n end of the bed, but a little to the east, and about 5 inches short of \n\n the extremity ; another needle about 7-8 of an inch long, was placed \n\n symetrically to the west side of the bed, and about the same dis- \n\n tance from its southern extremity. Thus a line joining the centres \n\n of the needles, would pass over the centre of the pig bed, and be \n\n about nine or ten inches shorter than the latter. \n\n\n\nThe needles having come to rest, and their positions been noted, \n\n the bed was filled with melted iron. A slight derangement of the \n\n needles occurred while the ladle was near, during the pouring of \n\n the metal ; but they soon recovered their previous position, as \n\n soon as the ladle had been removed. \n\n\n\nThey were then carefully watched in order to detect the first \n\n movements which should occur after the solidifying of the pig. \n\n\n\nAt the end of 20 minutes the metal being cooled down to a heat \n\n which made it barely red in daylight, the first movements were \n\n detected, slow and scarcely perceptible, but increasing in rapidity so \n\n that at the end of two minutes, the divergency amounted to 8 ; in \n\n 4 minutes it had extended to 20, the pig being nearly black ; and \n\n in 20 minutes more, the divergency had attained its maximum of \n\n 22 from the original position. As the influence of the earth's \n\n magnetism converted the northerly part of the pig into a north \n\n pole, it of course repelled the north pole of the needle placed near \n\n it, and attracted the south. The reverse taking place at the oppo- \n\n site end of the pig, the north end was there attracted and the south \n\n repelled. To ascertain whether any degree of permanent magnetic \n\n force would be retained by the pig, it was thrown from its bed and \n\n caused to make one-fourth of a revolution horizontally, so as to \n\n bring its longest diameter into the magnetic east and west. In \n\n this, position it exerted no power on the needle brought near either \n\n\n\n",

Alcide D'Orbigny. \n\n\n\nThis gentleman not only visited the elevated table-land of the \n\n Andes, which was once inhabited by the ancient Peruvians, but he \n\n remained a long time in that interesting region, and has collected \n\n numerous facts in relation to the people themselves. \n\n\n\n1. The descendants of the ancient Peruvians yet inhabit the land \n\n of their ancestors, and bear the name of Aymaras, which was pro- \n\n bably their primitive designation. \n\n\n\n2. The modern Aymaras resemble the surrounding Quichua or \n\n Peruvian nations, in colour, figure, features, expression, shape of \n\n the head, (which they have ceased to mould into artificial forms,) \n\n and in fact in every thing that relates to physical conformation and \n\n social customs ; their languages differ, but even here there is a \n\n resemblance which proves a common origin. \n\n\n\n3. On examining the tombs of the ancient Aymaras, in the envi- \n\n rons of the lake Titicaca, M. D'Orbigny remarked that those which \n\n contained the compressed and elongated skulls, contained also a \n\n\n\n", 
"36 [June, 1841. \n\n\n\ngreater number that were not flattened ; whence he infers that the \n\n deformity was not natural, or characteristic of the nation, but the \n\n result of mechanical compression. \n\n\n\n4. It was also remarked that those skulls which were flattened \n\n were uniformly those of men, while the heads of the women always \n\n retained the natural shape, the squared or spheroidal form which is \n\n characteristic of the American race, and especially of the Peruvians. \n\n\n\n5. The most elongated heads were found in the largest and finest \n\n tombs ; showing that the deformity was a mark of distinction among \n\n these people. \n\n\n\n6. The researches of M. D'Orbigny confirm the statements \n\n made at distant intervals of time by Pedro de Cieza, Garcilaso de \n\n la Vega, and Mr. Pentland, and prove conclusively, what I have \n\n never doubted, that these people were the architects of their own \n\n tombs and temples ; and not, as some suppose, intruders who had \n\n usurped the civilization, and appropriated the ingenuity of an ante- \n\n cedent and more intellectual race. \n\n\n\nM. D'Orbigny found temples from 100 to 200 metres in length, \n\n facing the east, and ornamented with rows of angular columns ; \n\n enormous gateways made of a single mass of rock, and covered \n\n with bas reliefs ; colossal statues of basalt ; and large square tombs, \n\n wholly above ground, and in such numbers that they are compared \n\n to towns and villages. \n\n\n\nMy published observations go to show that the internal capacity \n\n of the cranium, as indicative of the size of the brain, is nearly the \n\n same in the ancient and modern Peruvians, viz. about seventy-five \n\n cubic inches, a smallness of size which is without a parallel among \n\n existing nations, excepting only the Hindoos. \n\n\n\nM. D'Orbigny even supposes the ancient Peruvians to have been \n\n the lineal progenitors of the Inca family; a question which is not \n\n led Supposing this to be the fact, we may inquire how it \n\n happens that the Incas should have so entirely abandoned the prac- \n\n tice of distorting the cranium ; especially as this, among the Ayma- \n\n ras, was an aristocratic privilege ? \n\n\n\nI was at first at a loss to imagine how this singular elongation of \n\n the head was effected ; for when pressure is applied to a spheroidal \n\n\n\n", 
"June, 1841.] \n\n\n\n37 \n\n\n\nhead, as in the instance of the Chenouks and other tribes of the \n\n Columbia river, the skull expands laterally in proportion as it is \n\n depressed above ; whereas, in these people, the head is narrow \n\n from the face to the occiput. It seems probable that this con- \n\n formation was produced by placing splints or compresses on each \n\n side of the head- from the cheek bones to the parietal protube- \n\n rances, and another on the forehead, and confining them by rotary \n\n bandages. In this way the face, in the process of growth, would \n\n be protruded in front, and the head elongated backwards; while the \n\n skull, in all other directions, could expand comparatively little. \n\n These remarks will be more readily understood by reference to \n\n the annexed outlines, which are taken from a cast of one of the \n\n skulls obtained by Mr. Pentland. \n\n\n\nDr. Goddard suggested that the deformity observable in this \n\n series of crania, might have been produced by the action of rotary \n\n bandages alone, without the use of splints or compresses. Dr. \n\n Morton admitted the possibility of this result in some of the heads, \n\n but thought that in others there was satisfactory evidence of the \n\n use of the splint or compress, especially on the os frontis. \n\n\n\n", 
"38 [June, 1841. \n\n\n\nDr. Morton exhibited, in further illustration, six casts of heads \n\n and three skulls of these people, all of which present the elongated \n\n form in question.

It was the first step in this inquiry to mark the relation \n\n\n\n", 
"June, 1841.] 41 \n\n\n\nby external characters. These in the Welsh coal are, 1st. A struc- \n\n ture often lamellated, and tending to separate on the surfaces of \n\n deposition, owing to the quantity of carbonaceous clod which occu- \n\n pies the dull seams between the bright plies of coal. \n\n\n\n2d. The abundance and width of the reeds constituting the char- \n\n coal deposits. \n\n\n\n3d. The shining and polished surfaces occasionally presenting \n\n themselves to view at some of the natural partings. \n\n\n\n4th. The purplish tints of metallic oxide often observable on the \n\n surfaces of fracture. \n\n\n\n5th. The general colour is deep black, and either dull or shining \n\n according as the ply which is examined belongs to the coal proper, \n\n or to the carbonaceous clod partings of the seams. \n\n\n\nThe next circumstance worthy of attention in tracing the relation \n\n of coals, is their specific gravity; and this in the Welsh anthracite \n\n is from 1.336 to 1.372, not greater than that of many bituminous \n\n coals. \n\n\n\nThe next circumstance worthy of attention is the quantity of \n\n volatile matter, and this by the mean of two trials is 9.18 per cent.; \n\n that on the anthracite containing most clod is 10.7, and that of the \n\n more compact variety is 7.66 per cent. \n\n\n\nMr. Mushet makes it from 6.66 to 7.80 in the coals of the same \n\n locality. Mr. Frazer analyzed a sample of the same coal, and \n\n found 7.60 of volatile matter, 86.6 of carbon, and 5.08 of ashes. \n\n\n\nThe quantity of earthy matter in the Iniscedwyn anthracite, \n\n according to the mean of 3 analyses of Mr. Mushet, is 3.578 per \n\n cent. Adopting this for the proportion in the sample which yielded \n\n 10.7 per cent, of volatile matter, we have the solid carbon = 85.722 \n\n per cent, and in the other 88.762. \n\n\n\nAmong the Pennsylvania anthracite, that which according to the \n\n observations of Prof. Johnson approximates most nearly to the \n\n Inyscedwyn coal, is the coal of Lyken's valley, situated in the \n\n northwestern fork of the southern coal field. This coal has all the \n\n exterior characters of the Welsh anthracite ; containing in many \n\n samples a large portion of carbonaceous clod, with well marked \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\n\n", 
"42 [June, 1841. \n\n\n\nvegetable impressions; and in colour, structure, and varieties of sur- \n\n face, the two coals might readily be taken the one for the other. \n\n Of nine samples analyzed by Prof. Johnson, the lowest specific \n\n gravity was found to be 1.374, the highest 1.416, and the mean \n\n 1.390. The mean amount of volatile matter was found to be 8.067, \n\n the highest being 11.854 per cent. ; the mean proportion of earthy \n\n matter and metallic oxides is 4.46 ; and that of the fixed carbon \n\n 87.472 per cent. \n\n\n\nFrom these data we derive the following comparisons. \n\n\n\nSp.

The coke \n\n is perfectly anthracitous, and the angles of the fragments entirely \n\n sharp and well defined. \n\n\n\nThe gaseous matter of the Lyken's valley anthracite also burns \n\n with a brilliant flame, but no violent explosive development of it \n\n was remarked. \n\n\n\nProfessor Johnson made some remarks on the recent appli- \n\n cation of Anthracite, to the smelting of the magnetic, iron ores \n\n of New Jersey. \n\n\n\nThis has been effected at Stanhope, on the line of the Morris \n\n canal, 38 miles north-east of Easton, at which one furnace is now \n\n\n\n", 
"June, 1841.] 43 \n\n\n\nin action ; another is nearly completed, a third is partly finished, \n\n and the foundations of a fourth are prepared. \n\n\n\nThe ore used at those furnaces is mined at Irondale, 7 miles \n\n eastward of the works, on the line of the canal, and is found to \n\n yield in practice 65 per cent, of pig metal of a lively grey colour, \n\n soft, and easily wrought, though not remarkably tough. The an- \n\n thracite hitherto used is that from the Lehigh, chiefly from the \n\n middle coal pit, and according to their experience hitherto, a decid- \n\n ed preference is given to the Beaver Meadow coal. The hot blast \n\n is employed at a temperature of 600 degrees and upwards. The \n\n quantity of coal required within the furnace to make one ton of \n\n iron is 22 cwt. ; that for heating the blast, about 4 cwt. The air is \n\n delivered to the furnace under a pressure of 3 lbs. to the square \n\n inch. The amount of blast furnished by the engine is 4071 cubic \n\n feet per minute ; which as the furnace makes 8 tons per day, gives \n\n a little more than 25 tons of air urged through the bellows for every \n\n ton of iron produced. But the air heating ovens are supposed to \n\n receive about one tenth of this amount v and nearly an equal portion \n\n is believed to be wasted through apertures in the tubes leading to \n\n the engines. If this estimate be correct, the quantity of blast \n\n actually delivered to the furnace will be 20 tons per ton of pig \n\n metal produced ; a quantity corresponding with what has been \n\n found necessary both from theory and from experience in other \n\n anthracite furnaces. \n\n\n\n",

Redfield, Esq., acknowledging the \n\n receipt of a letter announcing his election as a corresponding \n\n member. A letter of similar import was also read from Dr. \n\n J. P. Durbin, of Dickinson college. \n\n\n\n", 
"June, 1841.] 45 \n\n\n\nVerbal Communications. Dr. B. H. Coates stated, that out \n\n of about 20 stalks of bearded wheat, which he had recently \n\n examined in Moyamensing, and which were selected as not \n\n having been able to develop their seeds, the greater part pre- \n\n senting the appearance called smut, he found all but two to \n\n have the aspect of having been stung by insects, in the first or \n\n second joint, generally the first. In all but four, the resem- \n\n blance of a sting appeared to penetrate the cavity of the straw, \n\n and the inside had the appeara nee of having been eroded, with a \n\n perforation extending to the outside. Opposite to two of these, \n\n on the outside, and under the sheaths of the first and second \n\n joints, he found puparia, resembling those of the familiar Ceci- \n\n domyia of Say. One of these was empty ; and the separa- \n\n tion of the leaf sheath from the stalk, with a black streak, \n\n pointed out a route by which the animal could have escaped. \n\n These cases last enumerated corresponded with the verbal \n\n communications of Miss M. A. Morris. \n\n\n\nOn the outside of another basal stipule of wheat, he found \n\n two quiescent animal bodies, whitish, with dark spots, having \n\n much of the general appearance of what is considered by Mr. \n\n Say, the larva of the Cecidomyia. One of them in 24 hours \n\n became of a pale brown and shrivelled ; and in two days more \n\n developed a dipterous fly, which farmers said they should \n\n have classed among the common destroyers of the wheat, \n\n and which was exactly of the size of Say's figure, measuring \n\n 3-20ths of an inch in length ; but was of a paler colour, and \n\n had setaceous antennse. Its general aspect resembled that of \n\n a tipulide fly. After a partial inspection by a gentleman who \n\n had bestowed much labour on Entomology, the impression was \n\n received that it did not belong to the genus Cecidomyia; and \n\n the specimen is kept for accurate examination. \n\n\n\nProfessor Johnson drew the attention of the society to the \n\n atmospheric phenomena attendant on extensive conflagration ; \n\n and stated on the authority of Dr. H. King of Washington \n\n\n\n", 
"46 [June, 1841. \n\n\n\ncity, that the burning of the prairies in Wisconsin and Mis- \n\n souri, is frequently, and almost immediately followed by rain. \n\n This observation had been confirmed to Dr. King by other \n\n observers ; and in the western country it had become a popu- \n\n lar impression that a prairie-fire was the forerunner of rain. \n\n\n\nDr. Coates had met with a statement in Nichols's History \n\n of Leicestershire, which bore on the same question; viz. that \n\n in the reism of one of the Stuarts, orders were sent to a sheriff \n\n of Staffordshire to discontinue the burning of Ferns during a \n\n Royal progress, because the operation was usually followed by \n\n rain. \n\n\n\nMr. Phillips adverted to the memorable hail-storm which \n\n occurred immediately after the last great fire at Constantino- \n\n ple ; the fact being fully authenticated by Mr. Walsh and \n\n Commodore Porter. That rain is common in South America \n\n after the burning of the Pampas, is familiar to meteorologists ; \n\n and the attention of the members is especially solicited to this \n\n inquiry, in order that a more extended series of facts may be \n\n collected and compared. \n\n\n\nMEETING OF BUSINESS, June 29, 1841. \n\n Vice President Wetherill in the Chair. \n\n\n\nREPORTS. \n\n\n\nThe Corresponding Secretary read his report for the last \n\n month, which was adopted. \n\n\n\nThe Botanical Committee made the following report, \n\n which was ordered to be printed in the Society's proceedings. \n\n\n\n",

The Corresponding Secretary \n\n read a letter from Mr. Benjamin Silliman, Jr., acknowledging \n\n the receipt of a letter announcing his election as a correspond- \n\n ing member. \n\n\n\nVerbal Communications. Dr. Morton (Prof. Johnson taking \n\n the chair,) made the following communication. \n\n\n\n\" I submit to the inspection of the members eight skulls of the \n\n ancient Mexican race, for six of which 1 am indebted to Don J. \n\n Gomez de la Cortina, and for the other two to Dr. John P. Macartney \n\n of the city of Mexico. All these crania have been received since \n\n the publication of my Crania Americana. \n\n\n\nThe skulls are of the following nations. \n\n 1. Otomies. Four in number, with the high vertex, flat occiput, \n\n\n\n", 
"July, 1841.] 51 \n\n\n\ngreat lateral diameter and broad faces, characteristic of the \n\n American race. The Ottomies preceded the Tolticas, and were \n\n the least cultivated of the demi-civilized nations of Anahuac. \n\n The lam-est of these heads gives 92 cubic inches of internal \n\n capacity ; the smallest, that of a female, only 67. \n\n\n\n2. Chechemecan. A single skull, of 83 cubic inches of internal \n\n capacity. This nation followed the Toltecas in the possession of \n\n Mexico in the 11th century of our era. They were nomades \n\n and hunters, but rapidly acquired the arts and civilization of their \n\n predecessors. \n\n\n\n3. Tlascalan. A single cranium. These people formed one of \n\n the seven tribes who established themselves in Mexico during the \n\n Chechemecan monarchy, and are renowned in history for their \n\n warlike exploits. They are well known to have rendered Cortez \n\n essential aid in taking the city of Mexico. This skull gives an \n\n internal capacity of 84 cubic inches, and like the others of this \n\n series, is remarkable for its diameter between the parietal bones. \n\n\n\nIt is worthy of remark that the average internal capacity of these \n\n six authentic Mexican skulls, is precisely what I have accorded to \n\n these people in my Crania Americana, viz. seventy-nine cubic \n\n inches. The mean of the facial angle also accords with my previous \n\n measurements, and gives 75. \n\n\n\nAll these heads were obtained from tumuli or mounds, within the \n\n territories of the nations whose names they bear, so as to leave no \n\n doubt in the mind of the distinguished gentleman from whom I \n\n received them, of their having pertained to individuals of those \n\n nations. \n\n\n\nThe two remaining crania are supposed to be those of Aztecks, \n\n who also belonged to the confederacy of the seven tribes, but were \n\n the last to take possession. These were the people who subse- \n\n quently obtained the supreme power, and under the name of Aztecs \n\n or Mexicans, governed the country at the epoch of the Spanish inva- \n\n sion, a. d. 1521. The Aztecks were a brave and intelligent people, \n\n but remarkable for bloody rites, both in their warlike and religious \n\n observances. They were less cultivated than the Toltecas, but \n\n\n\n", 
"52 [July, 1841. \n\n\n\nmuch more so than the surrounding barbarous tribes ; and appear, \n\n in fact, to have been the connecting link between the two. The \n\n largest of these heads gives 85 cubic inches of internal capacity ; \n\n the smallest 77 ; the medium being 80 cubic inches. The configu- \n\n ration of these heads is on the same model as the preceding series, \n\n and the mean facial angle differs but a single degree. \n\n\n\nWhoever will be at the pains to compare this series of skulls \n\n with those from the barbarous tribes, will, I think, agree that the \n\n facts thus derived from organic characters, corroborate the position \n\n I have long maintained, that all the American nations, excepting \n\n the polar tribes, are of one race and one species, but of two great \n\n families, which resemble each other in physical but differ in intel- \n\n lectual character.\" \n\n\n\nSTATED MEETING, July, 13, 1841. \n\n Vice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nDONATIONS TO MUSEUM. \n\n\n\nThe following species of shells were presented by Mrs. L. \n\n W.

"54 [July, 1841. \n\n\n\nA letter was read from Dr. Goheen, dated Monrovia, Africa, \n\n April, 8, 1841. Dr. Goheen gives some interesting facts in \n\n reference to the natural history of this region, and suggests the \n\n importance of sending competent naturalists to explore its \n\n numberless and extraordinary productions. \n\n\n\nA letter was also read from Professor John Locke, of Cin- \n\n cinnati, Ohio, in answer to the announcement of his election \n\n as a corresponding member. \n\n\n\nVerbal Communications. Mr. S. S. Haldeman communi- \n\n cated the following facts in Ornithology. \n\n\n\n1. Falco peregrinus. It is asserted in the works on American \n\n Ornithology, that this bird builds its nest on trees, and not \n\n in the clefts of rocks, as in Europe. So far as my observa- \n\n tions have gone, this remark is incorrect, inasmuch as they \n\n build in the cliffs which border the Susquehanna. This \n\n species remains in Pennsylvania ten or eleven months of the \n\n year. \n\n\n\n2. Quiscalus versicolor. Mr. Swainsonin the \" Menageries,\" \n\n (p. 298 of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia.) describes the female of \n\n this bird as a new species, under the name of Q. purpuratus. \n\n I have shot the male and female together, carefully com- \n\n pared them with his descriptions, and confidently assert, that \n\n they belong to one and the same species. \n\n\n\n3. Anser hyperboreus. I have known but a single individual \n\n of this species to occur on this part of the Susquehanna river, \n\n (50 miles above tide water.) Wilson states that it is found \n\n on the Delaware. \n\n\n\n4. Cygnus Americanus. Many flocks visited this part of the \n\n Susquehanna about 15 years ago, during a continuance of \n\n foggy weather, but they have not since appeared. \n\n\n\nDr. Coates exhibited specimens of larva? from the hollow of \n\n the straw of wheat, in the upper joint, obtained from a locality \n\n near Germantown, in which they were stated to be numerous. \n\n\n\n", 
"July, 1841.] 55 \n\n\n\nNo pupa) were observed by the collectors of these specimens \n\n in the same plants, other than those of the common appearance \n\n ascribed to Say's insect, and near the roots. None other were \n\n found in the present straw, after a careful examination. \n\n\n\nOther remarks were made, on the probability of several ani- \n\n mals, not all yet identified, infesting the wheat in Pennsylva- \n\n nia; on the beauty, learning and careful preparation of Mr. E.C. \n\n Herrick's recent memoir ; on some interesting observations of \n\n that gentleman ; on the effects of climate in varying the kinds \n\n and diversity of destructive insects ; and on the influence \n\n exerted by the age of the plant over the selection of a point of \n\n deposit for eggs. \n\n\n\nDr. Coates in addition to a former verbal communication, \n\n had observed the following. \n\n\n\nLarvae apparently similar to those above mentioned, in \n\n Blockley. \n\n\n\nA body nearly the size of Say's pupa, of a pure, homo- \n\n geneous straw colour, immersed in a depression of the \n\n straw, beneath a pupa of the appearance of Say's, and \n\n having, lower down than either of them, a round perfora- \n\n tion extending into the hollow of the straw, with this cavity \n\n eroded on the inside ; all from the third joint. This body \n\n subsequently assumed markings, having the appearance of \n\n the separation of a head, cases for antennae, and other \n\n organization. Though this appearance of development took \n\n place, and the subject was kept from June 23d to July 9th, no \n\n fly had as yet been produced. \n\n\n\nA very active larva, supposed to be of a lepidopterous ani- \n\n mal, ll-20ths of an inch long, colour reddish black, with three \n\n yellow streaks throughout its whole length, three anterior feet \n\n clawed, and it is believed some of the posterior ; the animal \n\n imperfectly observed from a wish to leave it but little disturbed. \n\n Found in Blockley, June 23d, in the hollow of a wheat straw; \n\n a round hole through which it could have entered, penetrating \n\n the cell in which it was feeding, and also the leaf-sheath with- \n\n\n\n",

Chaloner, \n\n Booth and Lukins. \n\n\n\nDr. B. H. Coates stated that Miss Morris had seen a Tipu- \n\n lide fly in the act of placing her eggs on or in a grain of \n\n wheat. This fly and these eggs she had in good preservation. \n\n On comparing it with Le Sueur's drawing, she could see no \n\n difference, except that the antennae were not quite so long, and \n\n that the small nerves of the wings were more clearly defined \n\n and strongly marked. She had also found a flaxseed pupa in \n\n the cavity of the straw, with no hole, crack or visible mark \n\n where the larva could have entered. This pupa she has exa- \n\n mined with a microscope, and she can detect no difference in \n\n it from that on the outside. This too she has carefully pre- \n\n served. \n\n\n\nThese important facts and specimens may, in the conviction \n\n of Miss M., either prove her previous views correct, or that \n\n there are two species of this destructive pest. \n\n\n\nMr. Phillips submitted the following memorandum, which \n\n was read and ordered to be printed in the Society's proceed- \n\n ings. \n\n\n\nIn consequence of inquiries from different persons of the date of \n\n publication of the papers in the early volumes of the journal of this \n\n Institution, I have searched for the numbers as published with \n\n their original envelopes, bearing the date of the month of publica- \n\n tion, and have been so successful as to find a complete series.

"60 [August, 1841. \n\n\n\nWritten Communications. Miss M. A. Morris, of Ger- \n\n mantown, Pennsylvania, through Dr. B. H.Coates, submitted \n\n the following \"Observations on the development of the Hes- \n\n sian Fly,\" dated August 6, IS41. \n\n\n\n\"Having completed a series of observations on an insect that \n\n has for years destroyed the wheat in the neighbourhood of Phila- \n\n delphia, I now beg leave to lay them before the Academy of \n\n Natural Sciences, with specimens of the insect in all its forms, \n\n from the egg to the perfect fly. To those familiar with Mr. Say's \n\n description, accompanied by Mr. Le Sueur's accurate drawings, \n\n given in the first volume of the Journal of the Academy, no doubt \n\n can arise as to the identity of the male insect now presented with \n\n the Cecidomyia destructor of Mr. Say; but the female differs \n\n materially in colour, her body being entirely black or blackish- \n\n brown ; and the wings are destitute of the hairy fringe so con- \n\n spicuous in the male. \n\n\n\nIn the months of March, April and May, I have frequently \n\n found the larva? feeding in the centre of the straw, from the root \n\n up to above the last joint. They were then of a pale greenish \n\n white colour, translucent, with an internal visceral green line ; \n\n mandibles of a dark brown colour. At this early period the larva? \n\n have frequently been so small that a magnifying glass has been \n\n necessary to detect them, \n\n\n\nIn the present year, 1841, my observations were unavoidably \n\n delayed until the first of June ; when I found that the larva? near \n\n the root had left the inside of the straw, and become pupa? on the \n\n outside, under the sheath. On the 20th of June, most of the \n\n puparia were empty; and on agitating the wheat, swarms of flies \n\n rose from off the grain, where they had been resting. I was for- \n\n tunate in obtaining one of these while in the act of depositing her \n\n egg on the grain. Thus interrupted, she placed six on my finger. \n\n Three of these I have glued to the paper near her. When depo- \n\n sited they were of a pale straw colour, and inconspicuous to the \n\n naked eye, unless collected in numbers. On the same day, I found \n\n\n\n", 
"August, 1841. J G7 \n\n\n\nlarvae in the straw, generally above the last joint. They were \n\n feeding in or near the joint, with their heads always downwards. \n\n The wheat, which had to this time (June 20th) promised an \n\n abundant harvest, began to shrivel ; and a practised eye could \n\n detect, from the appearance of the grain, in which stalk we were \n\n to look for the larvae. \n\n\n\nFrom June 20th to July 10th, the flies continued to deposit their \n\n eggs on the grain ; though on the last mentioned date but few were \n\n\n\nDO O ' O \n\n\n\nto be met with. By July 12th, the grain in this neighbourhood \n\n was all reaped ; and on that day I had a sheaf of wheat placed in \n\n the library, where I could with more accuracy watch the progress \n\n of the larvae remaining in the straw. They continued to feed for \n\n some days; when they became quiescent, fixed, themselves by \n\n their mandibles in the joint of the straw, and with their heads \n\n downwards, gradually assumed a chesnut brown colour ; the outer \n\n skin becoming the puparium. \n\n\n\nFrom a handful of infested straws placed under a bell glass, I \n\n have the following results. Most have perished ; some have \n\n passed into the pupa state in the centre of the culm ; a few of the \n\n perfect insects I have liberated from the centre of the straw, by \n\n opening a passage for them with my penknife ; and great numbers \n\n have been destroyed by the Geraphion destructor ; two of which \n\n I send with the Cecidomyia. \n\n\n\nFrom the sheaf of wheat I have the following results. Many of \n\n the larvae perished ; some became pupa? without change of situa- \n\n tion ; and the flies continued to rise from the straw until the 31st \n\n of July. Of these I succeeded in catching twenty-six. Five are \n\n Cecidomyias, and the remainder are Geraphion destructor; some \n\n of which are destitute of wings. A small number of pupae are \n\n still to be found in the field in the stubble. \n\n\n\nFrom this series of facts it might be presumed that the history of \n\n this interesting and destructive insect was decided; but the state- \n\n ments of observers whose information and accuracy cannot be ques- \n\n tioned, prove discrepancies in its history that can only be reconciled \n\n by supposing that there are two species under observation. The \n\n species now presented will agree with Mr. Say's statement, that \n\n\n\n", 
"68 [August, 1841. \n\n\n\n\" the perfect fly appears early in June, lives but a short time, \n\n deposits its eggs and dies.\" The remainder of Mr. Say's history \n\n must apply to that species which has been so frequently observed \n\n to deposit its eggs on the leaf.\" \n\n\n\nA letter was read by the Corresponding Secretary from \n\n Major James D. Graham, U. S. A., dated July 30, 1841, ten- \n\n dering his acknowledgments for his election as a correspond- \n\n ing member of the Academy. \n\n\n\nSTATED MEETING, August 17,lS41. \n\n Vice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nDONATIONS TO LIBRARY. \n\n\n\nGardener's Dictionary.

A lettter was read from Owen \n\n Mason, Esq., of Providence, Rhode Island, acknowledging \n\n his election as corresponding member of the Society. \n\n\n\nDr. Morton (Dr. Coates taking the chair) made some re- \n\n marks on the sutures of the cranium as connected with the \n\n growth of the corresponding bones. \n\n\n\nHeadverted to the opinion long in vogue, that the chief use of the \n\n sutures was to facilitate the process of parturition ; a theory which \n\n is refuted by the fact that they exist in the skulls of all the ovipar- \n\n\n\n", 
"August, 1S41.] 60 \n\n\n\nous animals as strongly marked as in those of the viviparous \n\n class. That they give a certain increased facility to parturition \n\n is unquestionably true ; but their more uniform function is to sub- \n\n serve the growth of bones, which they do by osseous deposition \n\n at their margins ; hence a suture in the cranium is equivalent to \n\n the surface which intervenes between the shaft and epiphysis of \n\n a long bone. The latter grows in length by deposition at its ex- \n\n tremities, and the epiphysis disappears, like the suture of the \n\n cranium, when the growth of the bone is completed. \n\n\n\nDr. Morton illustrated these views by means of the skull of a \n\n mulatto boy who died when about eighteen years of age. In this \n\n instance the sagittal suture is entirely wanting; in consequence of \n\n which the lateral growth of the cranium has ceased in early in- \n\n fancy, (no doubt when the suture became consolidated,) so that \n\n the diameter between the parietal protuberances is less than 4.5 \n\n inches, instead of 5, which is about the negro average. The \n\n squamous sutures, however, are fully open, whence the skull has \n\n continued to expand in the upward direction until it has reached \n\n the full vertical diameter of the negro, viz., 5.5 inches. The co- \n\n ronal suture is also wanting, excepting some traces at its lower or \n\n lateral extremities. The result of this deficiency is seen in the \n\n very inadequate developement of the forehead, which is low and \n\n narrow, but elongated below by means of the various craniofacial \n\n sutures. The lambdoidal suture is complete, thus permitting of \n\n posterior elongation ; and the growth in this direction, together \n\n with the great vertical diameter already mentioned, has allowed \n\n the brain to attain the bulk of seventy-seven cubic inches, or six \n\n or eight inches short of the negro average- \n\n\n\nThe growth of the brain and that of the skull are of course con- \n\n sentaneous; nor is it probable, that either could be developed \n\n without the sutures : hence there is reason to believe that the \n\n absence of these may be a cause of idiocy, by preventing the \n\n growth of the brain, and thus impairing or destroying its functions. \n\n\n\nDr. Coates inclined to the opinion that, in cases similar to those \n\n presented by Dr. Morton, the disappearance of the sutures was \n\n rather to be regarded as a consequence than a cause ; and took \n\n place, as in old age, because the necessity for further extension of \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\n\n", 
"70 [August, 1841. \n\n\n\ngrowth no longer existed, from the final cessation of enlargement \n\n in the brain. Uniting with Dr. Morton in the belief that the office \n\n of the sutures was to permit a more rapid development and \n\n growth of the cranium, by allowing ossification to go on from \n\n several centres at the same time, the bones of the skull, in this \n\n respect, resembling the trunk and epiphyses of a long bone, Dr. \n\n Coates inclined, at the same time, to the double belief that growth \n\n and other changes took place, not at the sutures only, but through- \n\n out the whole extent of a living cranial bone. The parietal bone \n\n of a newly born infant was not mathematically of the same shape \n\n with the central portion of that of an adult. Were the brain, in \n\n one of the cases referred to by Dr. Morton, to acquire, by any \n\n means, a further enlargement, it ought to be presumed, in the \n\n present state of our physiological knowledge, that the bone would \n\n enlarge to a corresponding extent ; and it would be therefore, in- \n\n ferred that the ossification of the sutures would not limit the \n\n growth of the brain. \n\n\n\nThis view Dr. Coates endeavoured to illustrate by a comparison \n\n with the opinion of Mr. Serres, that the relative and successive \n\n growth of the parts of the brain were a consequence of the relative \n\n size of their arteries during the period of formation ; in regard to \n\n which, he believed, physiologists were much agreed in the con- \n\n clusion that the developement of a portion of the brain and of its \n\n corresponding artery were coetaneous processes ; but that if any \n\n priority in causation were to be allowed, it should be assigned to \n\n the organ ; in consequence of the existence and comparative size \n\n in outline of which, it became necessary, if the ability of the sys- \n\n tem permitted, that a proportionate supply of blood should be \n\n furnished to the part, through a vessel of a suitable size, in order \n\n to aflbrd new materials for enlargement. Primary growth, he \n\n imagined, took place in the interstitial substance, and that the \n\n larger arterial branches, and even the capillaries were rather an \n\n instrument or adjuvant than a cause. The formation of additions \n\n to existing solids would thus resemble that of the primordiaof the \n\n foetus, near which no vessels of the parent are observed, while the \n\n vascular appearances are found to approach the newly organized \n\n individual at a period subsequent to its formation. \n\n\n\n", 
"August, 1S41.] 71 \n\n\n\nDr. Coates called the attention of the Academy to the white- \n\n ness, thinness, and semi-transparency of the specimen exhibited \n\n by Dr. Morton, in all the lines usually exhibiting the sutures. This \n\n he considered, not only as indicating the previous existence of \n\n real sutures, but as corresponding with the views entertained, by \n\n some late comparative anatomists, in regard to the analogy of \n\n parts. He alluded to those who believe the analogous parts in \n\n animal formations to exist to a very great extent indeed, although \n\n composed of very diversified materials, and adapted to very dif- \n\n ferent purposes in the various beings in which they exist. \n\n\n\nORDINARY MEETING, August 24, 1811. \n\n Vice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nDONATIONS TO CABINET. \n\n\n\nThe Society received from the estate of the late William \n\n Maclure, through the hands of his brother and executor \n\n Alexander Maclure, a five feet Achromatic telescope, 3i \n\n inches in the aperture, with two terrestrial and two celestial \n\n eve-pieces, adjusting screw, &c.

Mr. Speakman submitted \n\n some views on the nature of Light and Heat ; which commu- \n\n nication was referred to a committee composed of Dr. God- \n\n dard, Mr. Lukens and Dr. Griscom. > \n\n\n\nVerbal Communications. \n\n\n\nProfessor Johnson exhibited several specimens of crystalloid \n\n anthracite and bituminous coal, and stated some of the circum- \n\n stances which seem to determine the assumption by this mineral, \n\n of certain figures, contrary to the assertion of many mineralogists \n\n that it has no definite form. \n\n\n\nThe forms which anthracite occasionally presents are, 1. Ovoid, \n\n which causes it, in breaking, especially when the fracture takes \n\n place from long exposure to the atmosphere, to fall into spheroidal \n\n masses with salient portions strongly reminding us of truncated \n\n angles in ordinary crystals. This figure has often been observed \n\n in one of the beds of anthracite found on Beaver creek; and a large \n\n specimen furnished by Mr. Jacob Thomas of Beaver Meadow, was \n\n exhibited, showing the truncated borders along the lines of separa- \n\n tion in a very remarkable manner, and also displaying beautiful \n\n iridescent colours. It was remarked that coal affecting this form, \n\n is frequently found to leave a considerable portion of oxide of \n\n iron among its earthy residue; but that the whole of the latter \n\n was not usually a large per centage of the coal. \n\n\n\n2. The next definite form mentioned as affected by coal, is a \n\n radiated structure well characterized in several specimens from the \n\n third bed, from the bottom of the formation at Bear-gap, Dauphin \n\n county, Penna. This structure was likewise illustrated in a sample \n\n of Welsh bituminous coal. The radiations generally proceed from \n\n two points at no great distance from each other and forming two \n\n sections of conical surface, unite at certain distances from their \n\n points of departure into a single cylindrical section near the termi- \n\n nation of the rays. The exterior of these radii is of a silky lustre, \n\n striated, and sometimes interrupted by the interposition of frag- \n\n ments of organic remains, in the state of fossil charcoal. Very \n\n large stems are occasionally found with radiated, crystalloid an- \n\n thracite adhering to the opposite sides, the directions of the \n\n striae being on the two sides very nearly the same. \n\n\n\n3. The rhombic hexaedron was exhibited in a well marked \n\n specimen of anthracite adhering to its accompanying slate. Few \n\n mineral forms are better defined than this mass of anthracite. The \n\n angles can be determined with the goniometer with tolerable pre- \n\n cision, liable however to the slight uncertainty arising from the \n\n presence of organic bodies, tending to oppose the crystalline ar- \n\n rangement. \n\n\n\n",

An octahedron with tolerably well-defined faces striated in \n\n different directions on the adjoining sides, was exhibited, and the \n\n circumstance of possessing- a large portion of earthy matter was \n\n noticed, as belonging to many samples of coal which exhibit this \n\n exterior aspect. \n\n\n\nThe presence of several well marked crystalloid forms being \n\n thus established, Prof. Johnson adverted to the argument which \n\n such forms had been supposed to furnish against the vegetable \n\n origin of coal, and stated that in the very samples under examina- \n\n tion were seen the most incontrovertible evidences of the source \n\n from which not only bituminous coal, but anthracite also had been \n\n derived. In one and the same specimen of the latter, were seen \n\n mineral charcoal, natural coke, and true anthracite, indicating as \n\n well the vegetable origin of all, as the process of formation, by \n\n which the last two had probably been derived from the interme- \n\n diate state of bituminous coal. \n\n\n\nIn accounting for the supposed impossibility of crystalline struc- \n\n tures being formed out of organic matter, he observed that a dis- \n\n tinction is to be drawn between organic elements and organized \n\n substances, and that the former may often be so proportioned, \n\n when derived by distillation, fermentation or other chemical re- \n\n action from the latter, as to be capable of assuming definite figures. \n\n The production of coal from vegetable bodies is supposed, on all \n\n hands, to have resulted from a slow chemical decomposition of \n\n the latter and the establishment of new orders of affinity between \n\n the original constituent atoms. The carbon as well as the other \n\n materials of vegetables was by this process reduced, at least in \n\n part, to the condition of ultimate molecules, instead of being \n\n merely mechanically divided into small particles. It would there- \n\n fore be capable of obeying any law of movement which either its \n\n own affinities or those of the earthy constituents which had en- \n\n tered into the composition of the vegetables fiom which it had \n\n been derived, might tend to impress. That it is the earthy con- \n\n stituents which determine the forms assumed by coal, seems pro- \n\n bable from the fact that the more earthy residuum of a particular \n\n kind any coal contains, the more prone does it appear to be to \n\n assume a crystalloid structure. \n\n\n\nReference was made, in this connexion, to those cubic, rhombic \n\n and columnar structures which ofien occur in both anthracite and \n\n bituminous coal, and which not unfrequently exhibit to the eye, \n\n especially after partial incineration, the clearest evidence of a ten- \n\n dency among the earthy ingredients to regulate the arrangement \n\n of forms throughout the whole mass. Prof. Johnson also stated \n\n that the result of a considerable number of analyses of the ashes of \n\n coal, appeared to favour the presumption that the two principal con- \n\n stituents, silica and alumina, are in definite proportion to each other, \n\n\n\n", 
"August, 1841.] 75 \n\n\n\nand may therefore have a power of assuming definite forms. The \n\n oxide of iron in the ashes is commonly derived from the decompo- \n\n sition of pyrites, while the lime and magnesia in the coal are pro- \n\n bably in the state of carbonates, unless where the production of \n\n sulphuric acid by the decomposition of the pyrites has converted \n\n the former into gypsum and the latter into epsom salt. From \n\n this latter play of affinities the carbonate of iron would be produ- \n\n ced, and subsequently the sesquioxide, often seen covering the in- \n\n terstices of outcrop coal and forming bog ore in the springs which \n\n proceed from coal seams, the coal in the meantime retaining the \n\n form impressed by the agency of the silicate of alumina, and hav- \n\n ing a portion of its interstices or those of the underlying slates \n\n filled up with crystallized sulphate of lime. \n\n\n\nAdmitting the justness of this view of the causes which produ- \n\n ced crystalloid forms in coal, we have no more difficulty in ac- \n\n counting for the number of different forms which it occasionally \n\n exhibits than for the analogous variety in regard to other minerals ; \n\n the carbonate of lime, for example, which, as is well known to \n\n mineralogists, takes on a far greater number of distinct forms. \n\n\n\nProf. Bailey stated, that he had recently examined specimens \n\n of Calcareous marl from the cretaceous formation discovered by \n\n J. N. Nicollet, Esq., on the Upper Missouri, above the mouth of \n\n the Sioux river. These specimens proved to contain fossil Fora- \n\n minifera, (Polythalamia of Ehrenberg,) similar to those previ- \n\n ously detected by Prof. Bailey in the calcareous portions of the \n\n same formation in New Jersey and Alabama. \n\n\n\nHe also mentioned certain silicified wood found near Fredericks- \n\n burg, Va., in the feldsphalhic sandstone, called by Prof. W. B. \n\n Rogers \" upper secondary sandstone.\" This wood is in a pecu- \n\n liar state of preservation, the vegetable matter having been com- \n\n pletely replaced by silica, without any filling up of the cells or \n\n tubes. In consequence of this state of the wood, it is easy to \n\n subject it to microscopic examination without the trouble and ex- \n\n pense of forming polished slices. All that is required is to break \n\n off thin pieces with the point of a knife and moisten them ; they \n\n then show the most delicate markings of the tissue beautifully \n\n preserved. The discs with concentric rings, and other characters \n\n peculiar to Conifera, are so distinctly visible as to leave no doubt, \n\n that this wood which is commonly called in Fredericksburg, \n\n \" Petrified hickory,\" is really fossil pine. In the same formation, \n\n fossil plants of the family Cycadeas, have been detected. \n\n\n\n",

This species is a valuable acquisition to Malacology, as it \n\n enables us to place the genus Ancylus among the Limneans, where \n\n it has hitherto held but a doubtful place. Any one who has exa- \n\n mined the animal of Ancylus, cannot have failed to observe its \n\n similarity to Planorbis ; and some authors assert that it ascends to \n\n the surface of the water to breathe air. This I doubted, because \n\n the species with which I am familiar, inhabit the interior of bivalve \n\n shells, or the surface of stones in rapid water ; whence it is impos- \n\n sible for them to rise to the surface, and regain their previous \n\n position. I hence infer that they breathe water, as well as the \n\n Physa above described, inhabiting as it does, the middle of a river, \n\n in rapids nearly two feet deep at low water, and without objects \n\n rising above the surface. It is highly probable that air-breathing \n\n Ancyli exist; and it is even possible that the same organ may be \n\n adapted to the respiration of both air and water. \n\n\n\nVerbal Communications.

Specific character : nearly round ; slight- \n\n ly convex above ; posterior margin truncated ; ambulacra short, ellip- \n\n tical, the two posterior slightly curved and nearly a third longer \n\n than the others ; in a line with each there is an oblong perforation \n\n extending almost to the margin ; between the two posterior ambu- \n\n lacra, there is another perforation, longer than the others, and \n\n more central, at the extremity of which, beneath, near the mouth, \n\n is the vent. Mouth central ; diameter about six inches. \n\n\n\nScutella macrophora. Specific character : sub-ovate thick ; \n\n margin thick, truncated posteriorily , notched slightly opposite the \n\n anterior ambulacrum ; more deeply, opposite the lateral, and still \n\n more so opposite to the posterior ambulacra. Ambulacra elliptical ; \n\n the posterior pair long, and gracefully curved, so as to give room \n\n between them, for a very large irregular perforation, the margin \n\n of which is considerably raised, extending to the centre of the \n\n shell, giving the upper surface a remarkable elevation. The under \n\n surface is flat, rather hollow, particularly near the opening ; mouth \n\n anterior to the centre ; anus distant from the mouth one-fourth of \n\n the space from the mouth to the posterior margin. \n\n\n\nDiameter of large specimens nearly four inches. \n\n\n\nThese fine fossils are found in a calcareous deposite upon my \n\n plantation on Cooper River, in St. Thomas's Parish, about 17 miles \n\n from Charleston. \n\n\n\nThe limestone is granular, and remarkably adapted to the pur- \n\n poses of calcareous manure. \n\n\n\nIn digging it out and spreading it on the fields, these fossils are \n\n found in considerable numbers ; the S. macrophora is particularly \n\n abundant and perfect. The S. Caroliniana is also abundant, but \n\n from its size, and the number of openings in it, it is very easily \n\n broken, and is only obtained in fragments. I have only one perfect \n\n specimen and that is not quite 2} inches in diameter. \n\n\n\nIn examining these fossils in the light, the surface exhibits \n\n bright chrystalline faces ; the material of the shell seems to have \n\n become crystallized, since the destruction of the animal matter. \n\n\n\n", 
"82 [Setpember, 1841. \n\n\n\nIt is perhaps remarkable that many of the crustaceous remains \n\n in this deposit are well preserved, while the shells proper are for \n\n the most part decomposed. A few specimens of two or three spe- \n\n cies of Pecten, of one or two Ostrese, a Plicatula and a Balanus, \n\n are occasionally met with, while imperfect casts of numerous spe- \n\n cies are very common.\" \n\n\n\nThe calcareous deposit to which the preceding fossils belong, is \n\n the newest cretaceous formation of Dr. Morton, who first described \n\n its relative position and organic remains in his Synopsis, published \n\n in 1834. Dr. M. supposed these beds to be of the same age of the \n\n white chalk of Europe ; they are based on the ferruginous sand \n\n strata in New Jersey, North and South Carolina, Alabama, &c. ; \n\n and the two deposits contain a few fossils which are specifically the \n\n same. In fact, the Eocene or lower tertiary, also embraces some \n\n species of shells identical with those of the newer cretaceous ; \n\n whence the latter beds, like those of the celebrated plateau of Maes- \n\n tricht, may prove, as Dr. Mantell has suggested, to be a link \n\n between the chalk and the tertiary beds, without being contem- \n\n poraneous with either. \n\n\n\nMr. Quinby made some remarks on the mineral resources \n\n and physical geography of that portion of Peru which em- \n\n braces the eastern ridges of the Andes. \n\n\n\nHe alluded to the treasures which were secreted by the Peru- \n\n vians at the epoch of the Spanish invasion, and which have never \n\n yet been found, notwithstanding the continued search of the inhabi- \n\n tants. But the river Chucabamba possesses natural treasures of great \n\n value, for its sands are auriferous for several leagues above and \n\n below the temple of the sun. The inhabitants procure it by cutting \n\n the wool on sheep skins to half an inch in length, and then sinking \n\n them in the rapids, and at the base of the falls of the river, in which \n\n position the skins with the woolly side up, are suffered to remain \n\n from six to twenty-four hours. They are then carefully removed \n\n from the water, and turned wool side down into a batea or tub \n\n of water ; the gold is thus washed out, and is collected without fur- \n\n ther trouble. \n\n\n\n", 
"September, 1841.] 83 \n\n\n\nMr. Quinby adverted to the celebrated ruins of the Temple of the \n\n Sun at Huanuco viejo, (Tiaguanico*) the Cyclopean fortress, tbe \n\n walls composed of enormous masses of square and oblong stones of \n\n marble, greenstone and greenstone-porphyry, all which, with their \n\n bas reliefs and other ornaments, remain in a remarkable state of \n\n preservation. These ruins, as is well known, date beyond the \n\n dynasty of the Incas, to a people, however, of the same race, and \n\n probably of nearly similar political and religious institutions. \n\n\n\nMr. Quinby crossed and recrossed the Andes twenty-four times, \n\n at seven or eight different passes ; twice from Naranjal, (on the \n\n gulf of Guayaquil, one degree and a half south of the equator,) to \n\n the city of Cuanca, the capital of the province of Assuay, a little \n\n south of Chimborazo ; and having spent more than two weeks at \n\n the foot of the Peak of Raura, at least a thousand feet above the \n\n line of perpetual snow, he pronounces it the most sublime spot he \n\n has visited on the Andean range. Besides the Peak of Raura, \n\n which he believes to be at least as high as Chimborazo, there are \n\n innumerable smaller ones rising on the range of the Cordilleras, to \n\n the north and south, having their bases resting on perpetual snow, \n\n and throwing up their snow-clad apices into the pure and attenuated \n\n atmosphere, almost beyond the reach of the Condor itself. \n\n\n\nThe largest and nearest of these peaks is that of Nueva Potosi, \n\n the base of which approaches within one league of that of Raura ; \n\n and the intervening space is occupied by the lake called also Neuva \n\n Potosi, the surface of which is about 500 feet above the lower \n\n limit of perpetual snow ; and as this line, within the tropics is not \n\n less than 15,500 feet above the level of the ocean, the lake must \n\n consequently have an elevation of 16,000 feet. The water of this \n\n lake makes its escape by a subterranean passage on the western \n\n slope of the Andes, and also gives rise to the river Haura, which \n\n reaches the Pacific at Huacho, the celebrated salinas of the south- \n\n ern hemisphere. Mr. Quinby also described the Lake of Raura, \n\n one league north of that of Potosi, and giving rise to one of the \n\n principal branches of the Amazon.

"September, 1841.] 85 \n\n\n\nMr. J. S. Phillips read the following paper on the Nomen- \n\n clature of Natural Science. \n\n\n\nThe confusion in the nomenclature of Natural Science, owing to \n\n the number of synonymes with which it is burthened, makes it \n\n desirable that some fixed rule should prevail, by which naturalists \n\n mio-ht determine to whom to credit species, and what names shall \n\n have priority. With a view to call the attention of the Academy \n\n of Natural Sciences to the subject, I have thrown together some of \n\n the opinions and arguments urged by different parties, in the hope \n\n that eventually some definite rule in nomenclature may be generally \n\n adopted. \n\n\n\nIn determining the right to names of species, the only two points \n\n worth noticing, are, which description was first read before a \n\n society ; or, which was first printed and published. \n\n\n\nNow, the arguments that occur to me in favour of priority of \n\n reading, are, that when the author has read his paper, and handed \n\n it over to the society before which he read it, he has done all in \n\n his power ; that it is then taken out of his hands, and he has no \n\n control over the time when it is to be published ; and, that, because \n\n his society, for whatever cause, delays the publication until another \n\n naturalist has published it, it would be unfair that the former \n\n should be deprived of the credit of his investigations, by circum- \n\n stances over which he has no control, and that too, after having \n\n done all that was in his power. \n\n\n\nAnother reason urged in favour of the first read description is, \n\n that in referring to old descriptions, the date when the paper was \n\n read is precise the day when read being always one of the meet- \n\n ings of the society, and printed in the journal or transactions with \n\n the date, and therefore absolutely determined ; but the actual day \n\n of publication not always so readily ascertained. In answer \n\n to the first, it may be urged, that if merely reading a paper \n\n secures the species, it will produce indifference as to whether it is \n\n ever published or not ; and naturalists in general will be at a loss \n\n *o know what has been done in the case ; while specimens will \n\n remain unlabelled and unknown, because no one is particularly \n\n interested in publication ; but if priority of publication be the stand- \n\n 12 \n\n\n\n", 
"86 [September, 1841. \n\n\n\nard, other naturalists would not be long at a loss to know what has \n\n\n\nbeen done ; and as the rest of the community interested are a vast \n\n\n\nmajority, their convenience should have great weight in the matter. \n\n\n\nAnd when the meetings are not open to the public, the reading is \n\n\n\nstill less a point to be depended upon, as the committee to whom \n\n\n\nthe paper is referred might retain it for months, and in some cases \n\n\n\nyears, and in the mean time numerous species be added to the \n\n\n\npaper through the carelessness or connivance of the committee, a \n\n\n\nlong time after it was read, and perhaps after another naturalist \n\n\n\nhad published them ; and thus if the first read be the rule, a great \n\n\n\nopportunity for trick and injustice be offered to the unscrupulous. \n\n\n\nAnd even when the meetings are public, the author might borrow \n\n\n\nthe paper under pretext of verbal alteration or other excuse, and \n\n\n\nthen interpolate additional species. The same objections in part \n\n\n\nhold good against the other argument in favour of the first read \n\n\n\ndescription : the correctness of the date of publication may be \n\n\n\nascertained by all, but it is not so certain that the description of a \n\n\n\nspecies was read on a particular evening. \n\n\n\nThe arguments in favour of priority of publication are, among \n\n others, that it would be extremely unfair, that a man who has spent \n\n months or years in searching for species abroad, and then perhaps \n\n been at the expense of publishing them himself, should be deprived \n\n of his hard-earned credit, by some one who has merely read a paper \n\n of which the other could have no knowledge ; while, if he had known \n\n that the Fauna or Flora of that district had been collected and des- \n\n cribed, he would have made his researches in another quarter. \n\n\n\nAnother reason is, that by making mere reading the standard, \n\n all who were not present at the time, or had access to the minutes \n\n of the society, might remain for a long time in ignorance ; especially \n\n as a paper might not be recorded until reported on by the commit- \n\n tee, who might retain it for years when the volumes appeared at \n\n long intervals : even the members of the society who were absent \n\n when the paper was read, would remain at a loss to know whether \n\n any particular species were described or not. In this way the \n\n numerous specimens which are constantly scattered through va- \n\n rious collections would remain a long time undescribed and \n\n\n\n",

J 87 \n\n\n\nunknown ; as the possessors would be always in doubt, whether \n\n some one else had not previously described them without publish- \n\n ing : and thus the keeping up with the state of any department of \n\n natural history would be impossible, as no one could know what \n\n was doing in more than one or two societies. In the case of \n\n societies holding their meetings with closed doors, the reasoning \n\n applies with still greater force, as none but the members of that \n\n society could have the chance of any knowledge of the matter. \n\n\n\nThere is also another reason for preferring priority of publica- \n\n tion ; that many naturalists are working away quietly, exploring \n\n sections of country around their places of residence, in remote and \n\n unfrequented parts, who have no access to public institutions, and \n\n whose only means of knowing what is done must be through the \n\n press. \n\n\n\nThe great number of synonymes with which natural science is \n\n burthened, is in great part owing to the want of a fixed rule in this \n\n matter ; and it would seem that priority of publication would lessen \n\n the evil, more than the rule of having been first read ; as several des- \n\n scriptions might be read within a short time of each other, in \n\n different places, by parties in ignorance of what is doing elsewhere ; \n\n and then their various names be introduced into the nomenclature ; \n\n but when once published, it is every one's business to know what \n\n has been described, as the opportunity is offered to every one to \n\n ascertain ; and if a description be made in voluntary ignorance, it \n\n then could not stand. \n\n\n\nAnd not among the least of the arguments in favour of priority \n\n of publication, is, that of the two parties in the case, the describer, \n\n and the public of naturalists who are to read the description, the \n\n latter, being an immense majority, would find priority of publication \n\n contribute greatly to the interest of science generally, in promoting \n\n early publication, and preventing confusion by synonymy ; and to \n\n individual convenience, in enabling those who choose, to keep close \n\n up with the state of any branch of natural history. Now, as the \n\n descriptions would not be written, if there were to be no readers, \n\n the latter being so important a party in the matter, may take upon \n\n themselves to decide what rule shall obtain in the premises. \n\n\n\n", 
"88 [Setpember, 1841. \n\n\n\nWhile on the subject of the nomenclature of natural history, \n\n there is an evil which is growing so rapidly as to deserve notice; \n\n\n\nThat is, the custom when genera are sub-divided, or species \n\n transposed from one genus to another, to credit the old species to \n\n the naturalist who constitutes the new, or even modifies the name of \n\n an old genus ; thus depriving the original describer of his species, \n\n because it is associated with another series of species, or because \n\n the termination of its latin name be altered to suit the altered gender \n\n of the genus. In this way Linneus has been robbed of a large \n\n portion of his labours ; not by Lamarck, for he appears to have \n\n been superior to such littleness ; but by later naturalists, who have \n\n credited the old species of Linnaeus, to Lamarck as an authority \n\n and precedent for their own innovations and appropriations. When \n\n fairly viewed, it can hardly fail to strike every disinterested mind, \n\n that the credit of the original description of a species should remain \n\n with the describer; he described the characters of a group, a spe- \n\n cies, and whether that species belongs to one or another genus, his \n\n description of its character must remain : indeed there is no show \n\n of any attempt to change such description ; and if in the progress \n\n of science, new divisions of genera, or translations of species \n\n from one genus to another be found necessary ; then credit the \n\n generic change to the constitutor of the genus, and the species to \n\n its original describer, thus Planorbis Corneus. Lin. Lam. This, \n\n besides being strictly just to all parties, would have the effect of \n\n preventing useless and absurd modifications, by removing one of \n\n the chief incentives the having the name of the innovator tacked \n\n to specific names. \n\n\n\nMEETING FOR BUSINESS, September 28, 1841. \n\n\n\nDr. Goddard, in the Chair. \n\n\n\nThe corresponding Secretary's report was read and adopted. \n\n The committee on Mr. Haldeman's paper, \" Description of \n\n\n\n",

"90 [September, 1841. \n\n\n\ndescriptions thus put forth, are entitled to and should receive the \n\n sanction, and be adopted, throughout the scientific world. \n\n\n\nIn contradistinction to this, your committee are aware that there \n\n exists an opinion, that an author might claim precedence, from the \n\n time his discoveries were read before a scientific society, and with- \n\n out reference at all to the time of printing or general circulation. \n\n But this seems to your committee, a very uncertain and vague expe- \n\n dient, the source of perpetual embarrassment and confusion; and much \n\n of the retardation of the spread of knowledge maybe attributed to this \n\n cause. Many societies issue their transactions through the press at \n\n long intervals, months, even years, elapse before their discoveries \n\n reach the public : thus, it seems to your committee, manifestly \n\n unjust, that other collaborators should await such tardy enunciations \n\n of scientific knowledge, and so hazard the loss of their labour, and \n\n that too, by acts, even farther removed from their control, than are \n\n the periods, or the means of publication of the transactions of such \n\n societies, from the influence of their own members. \n\n\n\nYour committee deem it inexpedient at this time to extend their \n\n observations ; enough, in their opinion, having been adduced to \n\n warrant their conclusion that the most obvious and rational cri- \n\n terion by which to test the merits of conflicting claims to originality, \n\n is solely, the printed and published testimony. \n\n\n\nIn relation to that portion of Mr. Phillips's communication, \n\n which alludes to the modifications and changes in the designation of \n\n genera and species made in new nomenclatures, without assigning \n\n credit, where it is justly merited, thus wresting from the natu- \n\n ralist the honour acquired by his oftentimes onerous and unrequited \n\n toil, your committee trust, that the Academy of Natural Sciences \n\n of Philadelphia, will sustain them in an expression of decided dis- \n\n approbation of a practice, so fraught with evil, doing injury alike \n\n to science, and to its collaborators. \n\n\n\nEdward Hallowell. \n\n\n\nB.

Say's Bat (Ves. subulatus) has been several times described. \n\n It was first observed by Say, at the head waters of the Arkansas, within \n\n sight of the Rocky Mountains. It was subsequently described by Richard- \n\n son, who obtained it at the Saskatchewan It was given by Le Conte, in \n\n McMurtrie's translation of Cuvier, under the name of Ves. Lucifugus. Pro- \n\n fessor Green, in Doughty's Cabinet of Natural History, (vol. 2, fig. 270,) \n\n gave a correct description of it under the name of Ves. domesticus. He, \n\n however, erred in arranging it in the preface of his descriptions, under \n\n Rafinesque's genus Nycticejus, to which it does not belong. The last notice \n\n of it is found in Cooper's Monograph of Vespertilio, in the New York Lyceum \n\n of Natural History. This species has a very extensive range. We obtained \n\n it in the widely separated localities of Carolina and Labrador, during sum- \n\n mer. The Ves. Carolinensis is found in autumn, winter and spring, in \n\n Carolina; but appears to migrate northwardly in summer, and is at that \n\n season common in the State of New York. The Ves. monticola and Ves. \n\n Virginianus have not been met in Carolina or Georgia, and appear to be \n\n Northern or Alpine species, and no doubt exist in the Northern States. The \n\n Ves. Carolinensis may be easily distinguished from the other closely-allied \n\n species, by the large size of the first upper incisor; the second which suc- \n\n ceeds it being so minute as to require the aid of a good magnifier to detect it. \n\n\n\nThe genera of Bats have within the last few years been greatly multiplied, \n\n in order to include the vast number of new species which have been accu- \n\n\n\n",

The two species here described, belong to the genus Vespertilio, \n\n as now restricted. It is characterised by having four incisors in the upper \n\n jaw, in pairs on each side, near the canines, with a large, unoccupied space \n\n between them. The only species as yet described in the United States, that \n\n can be referred to this genus, are Ves. Carolinensis, Ves. noctivagans, Ves. \n\n subulatus, Ves. monticola and Ves. Virginianus. \n\n\n\nThe existence of a Brown Weasel in America, which does not become \n\n white in winter, has been doubted by some naturalists; and by others, the \n\n species has been regarded as the Mustela vulgaris of Europe. Dr. Harlan, \n\n (Fauna Americana, p. 61,) under the name of Mustela vulgaris, does not \n\n appear to have described an American species. His description appears in- \n\n tended for the common Weasel of Europe, which we think does not exist in \n\n America. Dr. Godman, after giving figures of the Ermine, both in winter \n\n and summer colours, considered the latter as the species improperly referred \n\n to Mustela vulgaris of Europe ; and in accordance with the views of Charles \n\n L. Buonaparte, the Ermine was regarded as the only species of American \n\n Weasel. Dr. Richardson, (Fauna B>reali Americana,) under the name of \n\n Mustela (Putorius) vulgaris, has described from specimens obtained by \n\n Captain Bayfield on the borders of Lake Superior, and also from others \n\n procured by himself at Carleton House, which he regarded as agreeing in \n\n all respects with the European species. He concludes, by stating, that this \n\n species, like the Ermine, \"becomes white in winter.\" We had an oppor- \n\n tunity, in the Museum of the Zoological Society of London, of examining the \n\n specimens referred to by Dr. Richardson, and of comparing them with Mus- \n\n tela vulgaris, and were satisfied that the species were distinct; yet, unless \n\n he was in error in stating that the American species became whire in winter, \n\n we are not certain that the species we are about to describe is identical \n\n with the specimens he referred to. \n\n\n\nMustela fusca.

The ear is a little \n\n longer, and more pointed, than that of either the Ermine or common Weasel. \n\n The white on the lower surface is not mixed with brown hairs, a3 in the \n\n Mustela vulgaris, and not only occupies a broader space on the belly, but \n\n extends along the inner surface of the thighs as low as the tarsus, whilst in \n\n the Mustela vulgaris, the white scarcely reaches the thighs. \n\n\n\nColour. The whole of the upper surface, to within three-fourths of an \n\n inch of the tail, is of an uniform dark fawn colour. On the upper surface \n\n of the tail, the hair is darker brown than the back, and its extremity is for \n\n an inch nearly as black as that of the Ermine. In writing this description, \n\n we have several specimens of the European Mustela vulgaris before us; and \n\n the ends of the tails in that species are uniformly brown, with here and \n\n there a black hair interspersed. Although the hair of the present species, \n\n at the extremity of the tail, is black, like that of the Ermine, yet these hairs \n\n are short and soft, and more like fur, and do not present the long and \n\n coarse appearance of that of the former species. The whole of the \n\n under surface is pure white; this colour does not commence on the \n\n upper lip, as in the Ermine, but on the chin, extending around the \n\n ^Tes of the mouth, and by a well-defined line, along the neck, inner \n\n\n\n",

The white on the lower surface is not mixed with brown \n\n hairs, as in the Mustela vulgaris, but extends lower down on the legs. Of \n\n the colour of this species, in winter, we cannot speak with positive certain- \n\n ty, but feel pretty confident that it is the same as in summer, and that it \n\n does not (at least in the latitude of New York) become white in winter. \n\n We, many years ago, kept several young Ermines in confinement, as well as \n\n one of this species. The Ermines all became white in winter, although some \n\n of them were not fully grown ; the present species underwent no change in \n\n colour, but remained brown during the whole winter. On another occa- \n\n sion, a specimen of a brown Weasel was brought to us in the month of \n\n December, which had been caught in a trap. At that season, the Ermines \n\n are uniformly white. A Weasel exists in the Southern States, and is found \n\n as far south as the upper parts of South Carolina and Georgia. It has \n\n always been represented to us as never becoming white in winter ; and \n\n although we possess no specimens at present, we are inclined to regard it \n\n as this species. \n\n\n\nDimensions of specimens before us, of the three species referred to above: \n\n\n\nLength of head and body, \n\n Tail vertebra?, \n\n Including fur, \n\n Height of ear, posteriorly, \n\n\n\nThe specimen of the American Brown Weasel, described above, was ob- \n\n tained at Long Island, in the month of May. \n\n\n\nWe subjoin a description of another species of Mustela, which, although \n\n recently made known to naturalists by Dr. Lichtenstein, of Berlin, who re- \n\n ceived his specimens from the vicinity of the city of Mexico, was not \n\n hitherto known to exist as far north as the locality from which we ob- \n\n tained it. We agree with Swainson, Lichtenstein, Dr. Richardson, and \n\n the most eminent European naturalists, that America divides itself into \n\n three natural zoological boundaries : the first including our whole coun- \n\n try from the farthest north, to the tropic of Cancer, where the tropical \n\n forms commence, to be called North America ; the second, including the \n\n Tropics, called Central or Tropical America; the third, South America, \n\n including all that region lying south of 33 J south latitude. The southern \n\n points of Florida and California will, in this case, be the southern bound- \n\n ary of our North American Fauna.

His descriptions, however, \n\n in every department of natural history, are so short, vague and imperfect, \n\n that it is impossible to identify his species with any degree of certainty. \n\n They have created such confusion in the nomenclature, that nearly all \n\n European and American naturalists have ceased to quote him as authority. \n\n Dr. Richardson has, moreover, described an Arvicola from the Rocky \n\n Mountains, which he has referred to the Noveboracensis of Rafinesque, \n\n which differs widely from the above species. \n\n\n\nHabitat. The specimen which we have described was obtained by Dr. \n\n Brewer, near Boston. We received another from Mr. John W. Audubon, \n\n who procured it at the Falls of Niagara. We have also frequently found \n\n it in the northern parts of New York, where the Arvicola Pennsylvanica \n\n also exists.

His diminutive figure in the 6th vol of his \n\n Ornithology, is not very unlike this animal ; but his descriptions, both of \n\n form and habits, which apply very correctly to Arvicola Pennsylvanica, \n\n have no reference to the present species. \n\n\n\nThe head is thicker and much shorter than that of Wilson's Meadow \n\n Mouse; the body cylindrical ; ears scarcely rising above the integument, \n\n and completely concealed by the fur. The legs and tail are short ; the lat- \n\n ter not as long as the head, and both are covered with very fine and short \n\n hairs. The fur on the back, which is soft and fine, and not half the length \n\n of Wilson's Meadow Mouse, has none of the coarse hairs which are found \n\n in that species. On the under surface, the fur is very short, not more than \n\n a line in length. \n\n\n\nColour. The teeth are yellowish white; the fur on the back is, from the \n\n roots, dark plumbeous, tipt with light ashy brown. This colour continues \n\n uniform till it reaches the sides, where there is a distinct line of demarca- \n\n tion, commencing at the chin and running along the neck and sides of the \n\n thighs. The whole of this under-surface is of a light cinereous colour, the \n\n hair being plumbeous at base, and so lightly tipt with white as to appear \n\n in some parts spotted with dark blue and ashy white. \n\n\n\nThis species bears a strong resemblance to the Pine Mouse of Le Conte \n\n (Psavnpmys Pinetorum,) which is also an Arvicola, than to any other.

Mr. Haldeinan called the at- \n\n tention of the Academy to several specimens of Unio of vari- \n\n ous colours, principally green and brown, the former being \n\n referable to U. viridis of Rafinesque, the latter to U. Tappan- \n\n ianus, of Lea. \n\n\n\nMr. H. contends that they are identical, because they pass \n\n into each other, both as regards colour and the peculiarities of \n\n the cardinal teeth, which are lamellar, and extremely variable \n\n in number and size. It was not necessary to add a synonym \n\n to the original name, as Mr. Conrad proposed the name sub- \n\n viridis (New Fresh- water Shells,) for the brown variety which \n\n he figured ; in the event of its proving distinct from U. viri- \n\n dis of the west. This method of proposing names is very \n\n proper, because it has a tendency to limit the number of \n\n synonyms which might might otherwise be inflicted upon the \n\n nomenclature of natural history. Some contend that the \n\n shell from the Susquehanna cannot be the viridis, because the \n\n latter has not been found in the west, its locality being Ken- \n\n tucky river, according to Rafinesque ; whilst the Tappanianus \n\n is found in the Susquehanna ; but Mr. H. has found unequi- \n\n vocal specimens in Pigeon creek, Kentucky, which cannot be \n\n distinguished from those found in eastern Pennsylvania. He \n\n has found a variety with a thick shell, in James river, Va. \n\n Rafinesque's name has been objected to, but one of the speci- \n\n mens exhibited presents as brilliant a green as that of Ano- \n\n donta cataracta, Say. \n\n\n\nMr. Haldeman wished the fact to be recorded, that he had \n\n placed some living specimens of Western Unio, Unio rectus, \n\n triqueter, circulus, cylindricus, ovatus and others, in the Sus- \n\n quehanna, where no western species has hitherto been found, \n\n except U. viridis, Raf. \n\n\n\n",

Lewis and Clark, in \n\n their expedition to the Columbia river, procured a few fossils at the \n\n great bend of the Missouri river, (Lat. 43 40' N.) which I identi \n\n fied as belonging to cretaceous deposits of the same age as the Marl \n\n or Ferruginous sand of New Jersey, Delaware, Alabama, &c. Sub- \n\n\n\n", 
"October, 1841.] 107 \n\n\n\nsequently Mr. Nuttall brought some additional species, but for the \n\n most part in fragments. Very lately, however, Mr. J. N. Nicollet \n\n having personally visited that remote region, obtained a series of \n\n fossils in far greater perfection and variety than any previous tra- \n\n veller. It is proposed on the present occasion to indicate the \n\n species, and accompany them with a few brief remarks. \n\n\n\nGenus Ammonites. \n\n\n\n1. A. mandanensis. Shell compressed, with scarcely two volutions, \n\n the ioner being received into a superficial fossa of the outer whorl- \n\n Internal and external margins armed with pointed tubercles, \n\n between which are delicate, gently curved costas, mostly bifur- \n\n cated about one-third of the distance from the outer tubercles, \n\n beyond which they extend across the periphery of the shell ; the \n\n latter gently plano-convex. Umbilicus imperforate ? \n\n\n\nThe diameter of the largest specimen has been about three \n\n inches ; of the smallest I have seen, an inch and a half. In the \n\n smaller specimeus the internal marginal tubercles are very indis- \n\n tinct ; but in other respects this species appears to be but little \n\n modified by age. \n\n\n\nJ. A. abyssinus. Whorls convex, making two nearly complete \n\n volutions, with strong, gently curved, bifurcated ribs, slightly \n\n tuberculated at the margin of the dorsal periphery, which they \n\n cross to meet the costse of the opposite side. Umbilicus perfo- \n\n rate. Diameter from three-fourths of an inch to one inch. \n\n\n\nThis species is strikingly different from the A. mandanensis, in \n\n the greater size of its costae, its perforate umbilicus, and its convex \n\n dorsal periphery. \n\n\n\n3. A. borealis. Shell convex, rapidly enlarging towards the \n\n mouth, with at least two volutions, one received deeply into the \n\n other ; costae delicate, gently curved, and bifurcate towards the \n\n convex dorsal periphery, which they cross in arched lines \n\n between numerous minute tubercles. \n\n\n\nSome years since I saw several specimens of Ammonites which \n\n were obtained by Judge Bry, in the township of Wachita, in Lou- \n\n 16 \n\n\n\n", 
"108 [October, 1841. \n\n\n\nisiana. I have elsewhere (Synop. p. 24,) considered them as indi- \n\n cations of cretaceous deposits ; and my recollection induces me to \n\n believe that their characters correspond either to A. Abyssinus or \n\n A. borealis. \n\n\n\nBesides the preceding fossils from upper Missouri, Mr. Ni- \n\n collet obtained the following species from the same interesting \n\n locality. \n\n\n\nAmmonites Conradi (nobis,) Synop. PI. xvi. fig. 1, 2, 3. Large and \n\n beautifully preserved specimens. \n\n\n\nAmmonites placenta, (Dekay,) Synop. pi. 2, fig 1. This species \n\n is found from comparatively small dimensions to a gigantic size, \n\n probably not less than two or three feet in diameter. \n\n\n\nInoceramus Barabine (nobis,) Synop. PI. xvii. fig. 3, and PI. xiii. \n\n fig. 11. This shell has hitherto been found only in Greene county, \n\n Alabama, but appears to be abundant in the Mandan country, \n\n often compressed and broken, but readily identified. \n\n Baculites compressus, (Say,) Synop. PI. ix., fig. 1. This species \n\n so nearly resembles B. ovatus of the same naturalist, from the \n\n marls of New Jersey, that I am almost disposed to consider them \n\n identical. The species in question is found of gigantic dimen- \n\n sions, for example, more than a foot in length, and three or four \n\n inches in diameter. \n\n Belemnites Americanus, (nobis,) Synop. PI. 1, fig. 1, 2, 3. \n\n\n\nHence it appears that among the small number of species no- \n\n ticed on this occasion, at least four are found in deposits of the same \n\n age on this side of the Mississippi, thus identifying the cretaceous \n\n strata over an immense geographical area, which commences in \n\n New Jersey, and perhaps at Martha's Vineyard, is traced in all the \n\n Atlantic States to Georgia, thence through Alabama and Mississippi, \n\n across the Mississippi to Louisiana, and Arkansas, where it is seen \n\n on the plains of the Kiamesha. From this point until we approach \n\n the Great Bend of the Missouri river, in the Mandan country, it has \n\n not yet been traced; but in the last named region, about 1500 miles \n\n above the mouth of the Missouri, it becomes again conspicuous as \n\n\n\n", 
"October, 1841.] 109 \n\n\n\nalready stated, abounding in characteristic organic remains of great \n\n beauty. The extent of this locality is not yet known ; it is probable \n\n that it occupies a very large area, and is destined to become one of \n\n the most interesting and prolific fossil localities that has tempted \n\n the enterprise of geologists. These fossils are remarkable alike \n\n for their admirable preservation and their great beauty ; the latter \n\n being much heightened by the presence of an opalescent nacre \n\n which has been rarely noticed in the other cretaceous beds of this \n\n country. \n\n\n\nSecond series, from the lower cretaceous beds, or ferruginous \n\n sand of New Jersey and Delaware. \n\n\n\nAmmonceratites. \n\n\n\nA. Conradi. Shell with an entire whorl, somewhat compressed, \n\n with numerous, distinct, slightly curved costse, which diminish \n\n and become almost extinct at the internal peripheral margin : \n\n external periphery sub-angular, and undulated by the transit of \n\n the costge. \n\n\n\nThis specimen is a cast in a dark grey ferruginous sand, charged \n\n with minute scales of mica. The terminal end is nearly complete, \n\n and is almost on a line with what appears to have been the mouth of \n\n the shell, and the two approach within a quarter of an inch of each \n\n other. Diameter 2 inches. \n\n\n\nThis is the first example of an Ammonceratite found in the \n\n United States. It was obtained from a marl pit near Arneytown, \n\n New Jersey, by Mr. Conrad, in whose name I gladly introduce it \n\n to public notice. \n\n\n\nThis genus is characteristic of the European chalk, having been \n\n found both in England and France, in deposits of that age ; thus \n\n affording another evidence of the analogy between the cretaceous \n\n deposits of the old world with the marl strata of the new. \n\n\n\nHamites. \n\n H. annulifer. Shell small, cylindrical, equal; the external two- \n\n\n\n",

The concave surface looks as if de- \n\n signed to receive the cylinder of the opposite side. Length nearly \n\n one inch. \n\n\n\nFound by Mr. Conrad in the ferruginous sand at the Deep-cut of \n\n the Chesapeake and Delaware canal. \n\n\n\nSTATED MEETING, October 19, 1841. \n\n Vice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nDONATIONS TO MUSEUM. \n\n\n\nEggs of sixteen species of birds found in Michigan, July, 1841, \n\n by Dr. George C.

D. \n\n\n\nChamveleo gracilis. Description. Head of moderate size, flat- \n\n tened above, depressed in front, presenting upon its upper surface \n\n a longitudinal carina, bifurcated anteriorly; each of the divisions \n\n resulting from this bifurcation, terminates near the posterior ex- \n\n tremity of the supraciliary ridge ; in front of the eye is a ridge \n\n continuous with the one above the orbit, extending toward the \n\n extremity of the nose. No denticulations are observed upon the \n\n supraciliary ridge, on the one just described, nor upon the longitu- \n\n dinal carina, or its divisions; but they are very distinct along the \n\n superior margin of the temples. A number of small tubercles are \n\n seen upon the face, quite near to the extremity of the nose, and \n\n also upon the sides of the head in front of the nostril ; a marked \n\n concavity exists upon the upper and posterior part of the head, \n\n immediately behind the bifurcation of the longitudinal carina ; the \n\n space in front comprised between the two branches is perfectly \n\n plane ; the head is covered above with polygonal scales of unequal \n\n size, and smooth for the most part ; those situated in the depres- \n\n sions upen the upper and posterior part of the head are somewhat \n\n\n\n^4 \n\n\n\n\n\n", 
"112 [October, 1841. \n\n\n\nlarger and more uniform in size than those upon the vertex and face ; \n\n scales upon the sides of the head of nearly uniform size, many of \n\n them tuberculated ; there are nineteen teeth on each side of the \n\n upper and lower jaw; scales upon the sides of the body of various \n\n shapes, some of them hexagonal, others pentagonal; the greater \n\n number are quadrangular : they vary also in size ; those upon the \n\n body, near the spine, are the largest ; some of the scales present a \n\n plane surface, others are more or less convex, and many on exami- \n\n nation with a glass are observed to have a very distinctly elevated \n\n point in the centre ; numerous small granules are interspersed be- \n\n tween the scales upon the abdomen; none are observed upon the \n\n sides : scales upon the throat irregular in size and shape, many of \n\n them tuberculated, those along the median line the largest; scales \n\n upon the abdomen granular, of nearly equal size, many of them \n\n presenting an elevated point in the centre ; those upon the under \n\n surface of the tail oblong, hexagonal, some of them pentagonal \n\n many of them with a depression in the centre; those upon the \n\n under surface of the hands and toes very distinctly quadrangular, \n\n arranged in transverse rows; extremities slender; tail somewhat \n\n longer (about a fourth of an inch) than total length of head and \n\n body. \n\n\n\nColour. The predominating colour is green, presenting different \n\n shades under different circumstances ; at times, the snout and mar- \n\n gin of the jaws, the neck, limbs and tail are marked with ferrugi- \n\n nous; and a narrow vitta of a light chocolate colour is seen extend- \n\n ing from the axilla to near the groin ; the whole of the body \n\n presents at times the latter colour, mixed with dusky green or fer- \n\n ruginous ; a triple row of black spots is observed upon the tail, \n\n extending from the root to within a short distance of its extremity; \n\n a similar row exists upon the back, corresponding with the trans- \n\n verse processes of the vertebrae : while one side of the animal pre- \n\n sents these shades, the other, or that which is less exposed to the \n\n light, is of a uniform pea-green colour, except the lateral vitta and \n\n a small spot above the shoulder, which are of a light flesh colour, \n\n and at times perfectly white ; on exposing the animal suddenly to \n\n the light of a candle, on one occasion, four or five irregular bands \n\n\n\n", 
"October, 1841.] 113 \n\n\n\nof a light chocolate colour were observed upon the body, extending \n\n from the back to the middle line of the belly, the intervening spaces \n\n as well as the bands themselves being marked with numerous dark \n\n coloured spots ; these bands often became dark green, the inter- \n\n vening spaces being a shade or two lighter ; seven or eight con- \n\n verging bands of the same dark green colour are observed upon the \n\n eyelids, their lower broadest part being directed towards the mar- \n\n gin of the orbit; pupil black ; iris golden ; under surface of belly, \n\n groins, axillae, as well as inner surface of extremities, whitish with \n\n a shade of green. The same banded appearance above described, \n\n was frequently observed when the animal was in exercise, as when \n\n employed in efforts to get out of its cage, or when allowed to walk \n\n upon the table or floor; when quiescent these bands were rarely \n\n noticed. On the 9th of July she laid twenty eggs ; these were per- \n\n fectly white, without spots, and of an oval figure ; for several days \n\n she had been restless, and was employed the greater part of the \n\n day in scratching in one of the corners at the bottom of the cage ; \n\n the coloration of the animal at this period was different from that \n\n noticed at any other ; the whole body presented a deep copperas \n\n green color, changing at times to a dusky brown : at times the \n\n body has a mottled appearance ; at others four or five dark coloured \n\n transverse bands were noticed, the intervening spaces, as well \n\n as the bands, presenting numerous light green spots upon a \n\n ground of dusky green ; on turning the animal suddenly round to the \n\n light, the side opposite to that described, appeared of a rich sap \n\n green colour, changing in a few moments to a deep bottle green, \n\n the transverse bands becoming less and less distinct; the spot over \n\n the shoulder and the lateral vitta were reddish brown : immediately \n\n after death the green assumed a yellowish tint, and two large \n\n blotches appeared on each side of the body of the colour of lamp \n\n black. \n\n\n\nSept. 11, 1841. The animal has now been immersed in alcohol \n\n for more than a year, and presents a very different appearance \n\n from that which existed during life ; the head, sides of the body, \n\n tail and upper surface of extremities are of a light bluish or leaden \n\n colour; the dark coloured blotches upon the sides are visible, but \n\n\n\n", 
"114 [October, 1841. \n\n\n\nmuch less distinct than at the time of the death of the animal ; \n\n throat, abdomen, and under surface of extremities and tail, whitish ; \n\n the spot upon the shoulder and lateral vitta are dirty white. \n\n\n\nDimensions. Length of head, one inch (Fr.) : greatest breadth \n\n six lines; height seven lines; length of neck two lines; of body \n\n two inches eight lines ; of tail four inches seven lines ; of anterior \n\n extremities two inches ; of posterior one inch. (These measure- \n\n ments were taken after the specimen had been long immersed in \n\n spirits.) \n\n\n\nHabits. The animal arrived in this city from New York on the \n\n 12th of June, 1840. During the first three days its appetite was \n\n good, spending the greater part of the time in catching flies by \n\n means of its long extensible tongue, which on one or two oocasions \n\n it was observed to protrude to the extent of nine inches. The \n\n motions of the animal were very sluggish, passing almost the whole \n\n of the day upon the perch of the cage in which it was kept, turning \n\n the eyes in every direction in search of flies, which were no sooner \n\n within reach than the tongue was protruded with the rapidity of \n\n lightning, and the insect rapidly drawn into the mouth. In the three \n\n or four following days, which were rainy and cold for the season, \n\n her appetite appeared to have failed ; during this time she was not \n\n seen to catch a fly, although many were quite near, but she often \n\n descended from the perch to drink; notwithstanding her indisposi- \n\n tion to eat, she would watch for hours the motions of the flies about \n\n the cage, the eyes preserving their accustomed brilliancy of ex- \n\n pression. On being placed upon a plane surface, she walked with \n\n more care, and often with more rapidity than might have been ex- \n\n pected from the pincer-like arrangement of the feet and bands, \n\n the fingers and toes being fully extended; but the usual manner of \n\n progression and general appearance of the animal when in motion, \n\n corresponded with the description of those given by Valisnieri. \n\n During the time that she was laying her eggs, she did not eat, nor \n\n had she taken food for several days previous ; she became greatly \n\n emaciated, and died almost immediately after their expulsion from \n\n the body. \n\n\n\nHabitat.

Charles Eden, of Monrovia, of one of the \n\n African natives, and sent to Dr. Blanding of this city, who, with his \n\n accustomed liberality, pi. iced it in my hands for observation and \n\n description. A drawing of the animal was recently shown to M. \n\n Bibran, of the Gardeo of Plants, by the artist who made it, who \n\n informs me that he considers it as new. \n\n\n\n*Dr. Goddard stated that he had examined the so-called \n\n \" Missourium Kochii,\" and found it to be a skeleton composed \n\n of Mastodon bones, most of which appeared to belong to a \n\n single set, many, however, having been superadded, and \n\n others mended and glued together in a manner wholly errone- \n\n ous. \n\n\n\nThe following errors were especially noticed: \n\n\n\nSpine. The spine presented the anomaly of 8 cervical ver- \n\n tebrae ; and instead of 19 dorsal and 4 lumbar, had 23 dorsal \n\n and 10 lumbar vertebras, making the number of bones in the \n\n spine too great by 11. The bones articulated with the 2nd \n\n and 4th ribs were cervical vertebrae. The spaces between \n\n the vertebrae were much magnified by thick wooden blocks \n\n placed between them, and the spine was curved upwards, so \n\n as to give an exaggerated idea of the height of the animal. \n\n\n\nRibs. These were redundant in number, and were spread \n\n out as much as possible, so as to present the appearance of a \n\n wide and flat chest. The 1st pair of ribs were stuck on the \n\n bones of the shoulder, to resemble clavicles bones which the \n\n Mastodon does not possess. \n\n\n\nHead.

A letter was read from Dr. \n\n Frederick Tamnau, Jr., of Berlin, acknowledging the receipt \n\n of his diploma of membership in this Society, and soliciting an \n\n exchange of the minerals and fossils of Germany for those of \n\n America. \n\n\n\nProfessor Johnson made some remarks on the samples of \n\n Anthracite from Rhode Island, this evening presented, and \n\n\n\nstated \n\n\n\nThat the formation in which they occur, reposes on a coarse con- \n\n glomerate, which rests immediately on granite or hornblende rocks \n\n of the primitive series. The near proximity of primitive rocks \n\n appears to have exercised an important influence, not only on the \n\n position, but on the present character of the anthracite of this for- \n\n mation ; for while it has thrown the beds into a highly inclined posi- \n\n tion, it has expelled the last vestiges of volatile matter, decomposed \n\n the sulphuret of iron, and changed the colour of the coal in some of \n\n the beds to a nearly steel blue. The vegetable impressions are in \n\n these cases to a great extent obliterated, and the traces of them \n\n only appear at the surfaces of deposition. In other beds, the im- \n\n pressions are more perfect, and their genera and species are more \n\n readily made out. \n\n\n\nAn idea has been formerly current, that the coal formation of \n\n Rhode Island and Massachusetts is of more ancient date than those \n\n of Pennsylvania ; but the identity of fossil remains occurring in \n\n both, seems to determine the geological period of both to be the \n\n same. And in this respect we have analogies sufficiently numerous \n\n in our own country, to induce us to believe that all the coal forma- \n\n tions are essentially contemporaneous, and that whether they rest on \n\n\n\n", 
"November, 1841.] 119 \n\n\n\ngranite, as in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Virginia, on the \n\n older members of the secondary, as in the anthracite fields of Penn- \n\n sylvania, or on the mountain or the \" cliff\"\" limestone of the western \n\n states, the coal series has every where been the product of a period \n\n in the history of our planet which was highly prolific in vegetable \n\n life, of which the remains were deposited on whatever member of \n\n preceding formations was exposed in a condition to receive them. \n\n\n\nThe anthracite of Rhode Island appears to have been subjected \n\n not only to a high temperature, but also to intense pressure, and to \n\n have been much comminuted by the friction of one member of the \n\n formation sliding over another in the uptilting which the strata have \n\n evidently undergone. The coal in all such cases being more tender \n\n and friable than the sandstones, slates and limestones, becomes the \n\n unguent in the joints of the stratification, and the results of its power \n\n to facilitate the motions of the strata as they are partially folded up, \n\n is, 1st, a pulverulent portion in contact with either the top or the \n\n bottom rock of the bed ; 2d, a high polish imparted to some of the \n\n sliding surfaces of the more durable coal ; 3d, an irregularity in the \n\n thickness of the coal beds, the indentations of the upper and lower \n\n rocks being not unfrequently found opposite to each other, forming \n\n thick places in the coal seam, and containing much of the broken \n\n material which has been displaced from the parts where the promi- \n\n nences of the rocks come nearly in contract, and almost shut up the \n\n seam. \n\n\n\nProf. Johnson adverted to the fact that for reasons stated by the \n\n geologists of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, viz. the great amount of \n\n drift or diluvial matter with which all parts of this coal formation \n\n have been covered over, the limits of the coal trough have not hitherto \n\n been traced with much precision. \n\n\n\nWithin the city of Providence, the strike of the beds is a little to \n\n the east of south, and the dip of course to the north of east. The \n\n mining operations are in general very troublesome and expensive, \n\n on account of bein<r carried on below water level, and through a \n\n thick stratum of loose earth and gravel. Very little of the coal \n\n hitherto obtained has been of merchantable quality. \n\n\n\n",

Giraud, presenting the copy of his work noticed in the \n\n donations of this evening. \n\n\n\nVerbal Communications. Mr. Quinby communicated some \n\n facts in relation to the Spontaneous Combustion of bituminous \n\n coal. \n\n\n\nHe had recently conversed with a gentleman who arrived on \n\n Friday last, in Philadelphia, from South America. The steam \n\n vessels sent from England to the Pacific, to run between Valparaiso \n\n and Panama, were made the subject of remark. His informant \n\n stated that one of the cargoes of coal sent from Great Britain to \n\n Chili, for the use of the steamers, took fire spontaneously on the \n\n voyage round Cape Horn ; and that it was with difficulty extin- \n\n guished. The gentleman also alluded to the fact so well known on \n\n that coast, that cargoes of bituminous coal, obtained at Conception, \n\n a few degrees south of Valparaiso, had ignited spontaneously on \n\n the voyage to Coquimbo, in the north of Chili, where an extensive \n\n copper-smelting establishment had been projected by an English \n\n company, and which was abandoned mainly in consequence of the \n\n character of the Conception coal. \n\n\n\nDr. Morton stated, that he had in his possession a living \n\n albino Raccoon, Procyon lotor, which he had received from \n\n the Rev. Joseph B. Gross, of Saillersville, near Easton, Penn- \n\n sylvania. The animal is remarkably large and healthy, with \n\n very long yellowish white fur and pink-coloured eyes. Both \n\n in appearance and habits, this individual has much resem- \n\n blance to a bear, and forcibly reminds the observer of the fact \n\n that Linnceus placed the Raccoon in his genus Ursus. \n\n\n\nProf. Johnson exhibited an apparatus to illustrate the pheno- \n\n mena of the rotation of fluids. \n\n\n\nA cylindrical vessel or jar, about 4 inches in diameter and 12 \n\n inches high, was placed on a stand supported on an axis of revolu- \n\n tion, standing vertical on a pivot, and put in motion by a band from \n\n a larger wheel moved by a crank. When any liquid is placed in \n\n\n\n", 
"122 [November, 1841. \n\n\n\nthis jar and a rapid motion is given to the latter, the liquid hy \n\n degrees acquires the rotary velocity, and by the effect of centrifu- \n\n gal force is compelled to rise round the inside of the jar. If the \n\n velocity be sufficient, the liquid may be made to rise to the very \n\n top of the jar and be thrown out. \n\n\n\nIf two liquids of different specific gravities and incapable of \n\n chemical action on each other, be placed within the jar, the rota- \n\n tion of the glass may give to the different liquids corresponding \n\n velocities of rotation, but these will be acquired in times varying \n\n with the adhesiveness of the liquid to the glass. \n\n\n\nThis diversity in the times of acquiring the same velocity as the \n\n containing vessel, gives rise to some apparent anomalies, while the \n\n speed is either increasing or diminishing. If oil and spirit of tur- \n\n pentine be placed in the cylinder, the former at the bottom, the \n\n surface of separation is more concave upward than the upper surface \n\n of the turpentine, because the oil is more adhesive than the spirits \n\n of turpentine : but placing alcohol below the spirits of turpentine, \n\n the latter becomes the more adhesive liquid and acquires the velo- \n\n city of revolution of the jar sooner than the other, whence it will, \n\n by its superior centrifugal force, be urged downward as well a \n\n upward, from its original level while at rest. The more adhesive \n\n liquid in this case constitutes a double concave lens. The same is \n\n produced when water, oil and alcohol are made to revolve in the \n\n same jar, the oil occupying the middle stratum in a state of rest, \n\n forms, at first and while the velocity is increasing, a concave sur- \n\n face both above and below, but when the speed of the revolution of \n\n the jar is slackened, it is by its superior adhesiveness sooner brought \n\n to rest than the other two liquids ; these will therefore, by con- \n\n tinuing their centrifugal force after that of the oil has ceased, cause \n\n the latter to assume a double convex form. \n\n\n\nProf. Johnson referred to some statements relative to experiments \n\n of this nature sometime since made in Paris, in which it was de- \n\n clared, that the \" chemical affinities''' of the liquids were the cause \n\n of these apparent anomalies ; and that attempts had been made to \n\n deduce from experiments of this nature \" a mechanical measure of \n\n chemical affinity.\" With that species of attraction he proved that \n\n the results could have no connexion. \n\n\n\n",

Land, presenting the \n\n Academy with the complete skeleton and skin of the Orang of \n\n Borneo, Simia satyrus? received November 2d. \n\n\n\nDr. George C. Leib communicated a description of the nest \n\n and eggs of the Fulica Americana and Anas discors. \n\n\n\nHe saw the Fulica Americana, in the month of June, 1841, \n\n breeding in the greatest abundance in the marshes bordering on \n\n Lake Erie, Erie county, Michigan. They were associated with the \n\n Florida galinules (Galinula galiata,) which were likewise em- \n\n ployed in the labour of reproduction, and so close was the intimacy \n\n between them, that their nests were interspersed over the marsh \n\n in the most neighbourly contiguity, seldom being more than a few \n\n feet apart. The nest, rounded in form and rude in structure, is \n\n composed entirely of dried or withered rushes, without lining of any \n\n sort, slightly interlaced, except at bottom, where there is a simple \n\n crossing of the pieces to the depth of several inches. \n\n\n\nIt is five inches in depth, by a foot and a half to two feet in \n\n diameter. This large mass is placed on the surface of the water \n\n among the dense rushes, to which it is attached in several points of \n\n its circumference, thus rendering it less liable to be swept ofFby the \n\n winds and waves. \n\n\n\nWhen disturbed these birds emit a note not unlike the cackle of \n\n the domestic hen, which is transmitted from one to the other for a \n\n considerable distance around, till the air becomes vocal with their \n\n music. This was heard by Dr. Leib not only during the day, but \n\n also at all hours of the night. \n\n\n\nThe number of the eggs varies from ten to fifteen, though the \n\n latter were observed to prevail. They are of an oval form, and \n\n measure two inches by one inch and a quarter, uniformly sprinkled \n\n with small dark brown spots on a greenish yellow ground. Both \n\n male and female assist in incubation. \n\n\n\nOwing to their exceeding abundance, they are gathered by the \n\n neighbouring farmers for the table, and are considered by them \n\n superior in flavour and delicacy to the common hen's egg. \n\n\n\n", 
"November, 1841.] 125 \n\n\n\nDr. Leib found the nest of the blue-winged Teal (Anas discors,) \n\n together with that of the Mallard (Anas boschas,) in the month of \n\n June, in the meadows adjoining the marsh above referred to. \n\n\n\nIt is composed externally of dried grasses, neatly arranged in a \n\n circular form, and lined with a thick bed of down, taken from the \n\n breast of the female. It contained 18 eggs of a delicate cream \n\n colour, which measure 2 inches by 1| inch. Though remarkably \n\n timid and wary at other times, such is its abstraction or devotion \n\n when upon the nest, that it would suffer me to approach near enough \n\n to strike it with a stick ; then in the greatest alarm, suddenly flutter \n\n and bustle off through the grass for some distance, like a wounded \n\n bird ; until, satisfied that the ruse had diverted attention from its \n\n treasure, it would mount into the air and quickly leave the object \n\n of its terror and solicitude behind. \n\n\n\nDr. Morton made some remarks on the so called Pigmy race \n\n of people who are asserted to have formerly inhabited a part \n\n of the Valley of the Mississippi. \n\n\n\nIt has long been contended by intelligent persons, who, however, \n\n were ignorant of anatomy, that the adjusted bones of individuals of \n\n this race, never exceed four feet and a half in height, and are \n\n often but three feet. These statements induced Dr. Morton to inves- \n\n tigate the subject by means of a skeleton of one of these people, \n\n which he at length obtained through the kindness of Dr. Troost of \n\n Nashville ; Mr. A. M'Call, a correspondent of Dr. Troost, having \n\n exhumed these remains from a cemetery near the Cumberland \n\n Mountain, in White county, Tennessee. \n\n\n\n\" The coffins,\" observes Mr. M'Call, in the letter read by Dr. \n\n Morton, \"are from 18 to 24 inches in length, by 18 inches deep \n\n and 15 wide. They are made of six pieces of undressed sandstone \n\n or limestone, in which the bodies are placed with their shoulders \n\n and head elevated against the eastern end, and the knees raised \n\n towards the face, so as to put the corpse in a reclined or sitting pos- \n\n ture. The right arm rested on an eathern pot, of about two pints \n\n in capacity, without legs, but with lateral projections for being lifted. \n\n With these pots, in some graves, are found basins and trays also of \n\n\n\n19 \n\n\n\n", 
"126 [November, 1841. \n\n\n\npipe clay and comminuted shells mixed ; and no one of these reposi- \n\n tories is without cooking utensils. In one of the graves was found \n\n a complete skull, and an os femoris, but most of the other bones \n\n were broken in hastily removing them. This is said to be the lar- \n\n gest skeleton ever found at any of these burying grounds. It has \n\n the cranium very flat and broad, with very projecting front teeth, \n\n and appears to have pertained to an individual not over twelve or \n\n fourteen years of age.\" \n\n\n\nAfter reading Mr. M'Call's letter, Dr. Morton exhibited the \n\n bones which accompanied it, and remarked that the stage of devel- \n\n opment of the teeth indicated a very juvenile subject. For example, \n\n many of the deciduous or first teeth yet remained in both jaws ; \n\n while the only teeth of the permanent set which had protruded, were \n\n the first molars and the incisors, which, as every anatomist knows, \n\n make their appearance at about seven years of age. Of the other \n\n permanent teeth, some had no part formed but the crown, and all \n\n were completely embraced within the maxillary bones. The pre- \n\n sence of the new incisors, isolated from the cuspidati which had not \n\n appeared, obviously gave rise to Mr. M'Call's remark respecting \n\n the very \" projecting front teeth,\" but which, however, are perfectly \n\n natural in position and proportion. The cranial bones are thin, and \n\n readily separable at the sutures ; nor does the flat and broad confi- \n\n guration of the cranium differ from what is common to the aborigi- \n\n nal American race. The long bones have their extremities sepa- \n\n rated by ephiphyses ; and every fact observed in these remains is \n\n strictly characteristic of early childhood ; or about the seventh \n\n year of life. Even the recumbent or sitting posture in which \n\n they are found, has been observed in the dead bodies of the \n\n American nations from Cape Horn to Canada ; and the utensils \n\n found with them, are the same in form and composition with \n\n those exhumed from the graves of the common Indians. \n\n\n\nDr. Morton concluded by remarking that these remains were to \n\n him an additional and convincing proof of what he had never doubt- \n\n ed viz. that the so called Pigmies of the western country, were \n\n merely children, who, for reasons not readily explained, but which \n\n actuate some religious communities of our own time, were buried \n\n apart from the adult people of their tribe. \n\n\n\n",

Prof. Johnson exhibited and ex- \n\n plained his apparatus, illustrative of the laws of chemical \n\n combination and of the combining volumes of gaseous sub- \n\n stances. \n\n\n\nThis apparatus consists of a series of cubical types, each of such \n\n magnitude as to represent by its bulk in cubic inches the atomic \n\n weight of one of the elementary bodies. Thus hydrogen is represent- \n\n ed by a cube one inch on a side ; oxygen, by a cube of two inches \n\n on a side, containing of course eight cubic inches ; iron by a cube \n\n containing twenty-eight cubic inches, and so of the whole fifty-four \n\n\n\n", 
"128 [November, 1841. \n\n\n\nsimple bodies. The largest cube representing Uranium is a little \n\n more than six inches on a side. Each cube bears on one of its \n\n faces the conventional chemical symbol of the body whose atomic \n\n weight it represents, usually the first letter of its name, together \n\n with the number expressing its atomic weight. Many of the \n\n types are coloured either by a coating of the material represented, \n\n or by some convenient pigment exhibiting the natural appearance \n\n of the body represented. The number of types of each body \n\n varies with the complexity of the compounds into which it is capa- \n\n ble of entering ; the greatest number being required of those bodies, \n\n which constitute organic substances, viz. carbon, hydrogen, oxygen \n\n and nitrogen. \n\n\n\nA second part of the apparatus consists of a light frame support- \n\n ing three shelves about fourteen inches apart, open both at the \n\n front and rear. This frame is four feet long and two and a half feet \n\n high. In order to represent chemical combinations and decomposi- \n\n tions, the atom-cubes are first placed separately upon the middle \n\n shelf, to represent the case of solution or the liquid state. They \n\n are then brought together to indicate mixture of solutions. To \n\n represent precipitation, those atoms which are in fact precipitated \n\n in actual solutions are carried to the lower shelf; and to represent \n\n the products converted into gas, those atoms which constitute such \n\n products are carried from the middle to the upper shelf. \n\n\n\nThe chemist performs the processes first in his jars or retorts, \n\n and then arranges the atoms to indicate the real operations which \n\n have been taking place before the eyes of his class. \n\n\n\nIn exhibiting the combinations of bodies which may assume a \n\n gaseous form, Prof. Johnson makes use of a third apparatus, con- \n\n sisting of glass cubical boxes of 100 cubic inches each, and of others \n\n containing 50 and 16# cubic inches. \n\n\n\nTo represent the combinations and decompositions of gases as in \n\n experiments in Eudiometry, both the cubical types and glass boxes \n\n are brought into requisition. Thus the type of hydrogen (a cube \n\n one inch on a side, marked H 1 ,) is placed on the upper shelf, and \n\n over it is inverted a cubical glass box, marked 100, and actually \n\n containing that number of cubic inches ; an oxygen type (marked \n\n\n\n", 
"November, 1841.] \\2<j \n\n\n\nO 8) is placed separately on the same shelf under a glass box of \n\n the same size as to base, but of only half tiie height of the former, \n\n and containing of course 50 cubic inches. To represent the com- \n\n bination of these gases to form water and to indicate the amount of \n\n condensation which takes place, the oxygen type is taken from \n\n under its own box and placed with the hydrogen type beneath the \n\n glass box of 100 cubic inches, the 50 inch box being at the same \n\n time removed from the frame. There is then seen the sum of the \n\n weights of the constituents of water (9), and the bulk of the vapour \n\n of water, the same as that of the hydrogen which had entered into \n\n its composition. To convey the impression that the product is a \n\n liquid, the resulting combination of atoms is carried from the upper \n\n to the middle shelf, without being accompanied by the volume-cube. \n\n\n\nThe advantages found to result from this method of illustration \n\n over those hitherto in use were stated to be the saving of much \n\n time and labour, in writing out diagrams and making drawings, \n\n and the avoiding of inconvenience of working at a black-board to \n\n give after all but an imperfect impression of the truth to be con- \n\n veyed. An effect of not less importance was derived from appeal- \n\n ing to different faculties at the same time. \n\n\n\nTo some minds the bulk of a body conveys a far more distinct \n\n impression of its weight than the figures which represent that \n\n weight. In the method now exhibited, both these modes of appeal- \n\n ing to the mind and memory are united. The colour of many of \n\n the substances combined with the bulk with the symbols which \n\n represent them and with the figures which expi-ess their weight, can \n\n hardly fail to fix a lasting impression on the mind of every student \n\n in chemistry. To these maybe added the facility of making appa- \n\n rent by direct juxtaposition the relation by weight and by volume \n\n of the constituents of all gaseous mixtures. \n\n\n\nThe application of this apparatus was shown in exhibiting the \n\n composition of the oxides and other minerals. \n\n\n\nThe views of M. Liebig in regard to the composition and true \n\n radical of Phosgene gas, carbonic acid and oxalic acid, were also \n\n displayed. \n\n\n\nThe constitution of ammonia, of atmospheric air, of nitrous- \n\n\n\n20 \n\n\n\n",

Leib remarked, that \n\n in looking over Dr. Giraud's work entitled \" Sixteen New \n\n Species of Birds,\" he found the Parus leucotis of Giraud, to \n\n be identical with the Setofaga rubra of Swaiuson. \n\n\n\nProfessor Johnson made some observations on the sponta- \n\n neous combustion of Bituminous Coal. \n\n\n\nHe stated that he had recently been invited to inspect aheap of \n\n biluminous coal on the premises of Mr. John W. Middleton of this \n\n city, which had for a few days previous been observed to be grow- \n\n ing warm and giving off vapour very copiously, from which it \n\n was inferred to be approaching spontaneous combustion. The \n\n coal in question was stated to be from the Allegheny mountain, \n\n above Holidaysburg, and to be a mixture of two or three different \n\n mines. On causing a hole to be excavated about three feet deep, \n\n the temperature was found to be 110 Fahrenheit ; and the day \n\n being cold, (below freezing point) the volume of steam which \n\n arose on moving the coal was so great as almost completely to \n\n envelope and hide the workmen. All parts of the heap were ob- \n\n served to exhibit distinct traces of the effloresced sulphate of iron; \n\n or if some pieces of the coal had no visible marks of this kind, \n\n they still exhibited to the sense of taste the strongest evidence of \n\n being covered with that salt. \n\n\n\nThis coal evidently possessed all the requisites for producing \n\n spontaneous combustion, and only required time, and perhaps a \n\n rather larger heap, to bring that process to the same termination \n\n as was observed a few weeks since in the city of Lowell. \n\n\n\nThe chairman having announced the demise of our vener- \n\n able associate John Vaughan. Esq., on motion of Professor \n\n Johnson, it was unanimously \n\n\n\nResolved, That this Society have heard with deep regret, the \n\n announcement of the decease of their late valuable member, John \n\n Vaughan, Esq., so long known in our community for his various \n\n merits, both in relation to scientific objects and to benevolent pur- \n\n poses and institutions ; and they would by this act testify their \n\n\n\n",

Bell, of New York, dated \n\n January Sth, in which he offers some remarks on the two \n\n specimens of Fuligula minor, or lesser Scaup Duck, presented \n\n by him this evening. He states, that they have hitherto been \n\n mistaken for the common Scaup Duck, (Anas marila of Wil- \n\n son); and although Mr. Audubon figures this bird, and Wilson \n\n the larger one, these naturalists had supposed them to be spe- \n\n\n\n",

Rogers, of Virginia, has recently satisfied himself of the geologi- \n\n cal age of the coal formation of the vicinity of Richmond ; and also \n\n of the date of the Fredericksburgh sandstone. The former he re- \n\n gards as nearly equivalent in period to the lias of Europe, and the \n\n laiter to be referable to that of the oolite. The existence in the \n\n Richmond coal measures of the genus Tseniopterus, a race of \n\n plants strictly characteristic of the lias, is one of the points upon \n\n which he rests his conclusions respecting that formation. A dis- \n\n covery in the Fredericksburg sandstone of fossil cycadeae and \n\n other organic remains, lead hirn to place this rock in the period \n\n of the oolites. He considers those the only formations yet recog- \n\n nised in the United States, which are referable to the ages of the \n\n European Lias and Oolite rocks. \n\n\n\n",

Professor Johnson stated the \n\n results of some experiments on the magnetism of bars of \n\n wrought iron broke by tensile force. \n\n\n\nHe referred to a former communication, in which he had given \n\n an account of trials on cast iron in a state of fusion, and to the \n\n influence of terrestrial magnetism, inducing the magnetic state in \n\n bars of iron, according to the position in which they are placed \n\n with reference to the magnetic axis. He had found that when a \n\n bar of soft iron is drawn asunder at ordinary temperatures, and \n\n in the direction of the magnetic meridian, there was also manifes- \n\n ted at the point of fracture a decided evidence of magnetic polar- \n\n ity; and that the kind of magnetism was that belonging to the \n\n region towards which the broken extremity of each fragment \n\n pointed. This magnetic condition was indicated by the adhesion \n\n of any particle of iron or of hammer cinder, which chanced to be \n\n near the fracture at the moment, as well as by the action of a \n\n small needle when held near the point. \n\n\n\nIf the two extremities separated from each other by a short \n\n distance, be at the moment of fracture in contact with a mass of \n\n iron filings, the latter will adhere to the two ends, and extending \n\n across, form a continuous line or bridge, which appears to serve \n\n as a keeper, for they continue for a considerable time with little \n\n diminution of their force. \n\n\n\nWhen the fracture is made at a red heat, little or no magnetic \n\n effect appears to result from the action of breaking. But when \n\n\n\n", 
"January, 1842.] 145 \n\n\n\nthe temperature of the bar is between five and six hundred degrees \n\n of Fahrenheit, the magnetism is not only marked at the time, but \n\n is in a great degree permanent. Samples were stated to have been \n\n examined, which had been broken for several years, and to be \n\n still in the same magnetic state in which they were at the moment \n\n of fracture. \n\n\n\nIn order to prove what part of the effect in the foregoing in- \n\n stances, was due to the earth's magnetic influence, the proving \n\n machine which produced ihe fracture, was changed in position, so \n\n as to place the bar, in proving, directly across the magnetic meri- \n\n dian, instead of coinciding with it as before. In this case no po- \n\n larity was observed, whether the bars were broken cold or hot, \n\n except some slight indications in a direction across the breadth of \n\n the bar at the point of fracture. \n\n\n\nMEETING FOR BUSINESS. \n\n\n\nJanuary 25th, 1842. \n\n\n\nVice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nReports of Committees.

Prof. Johnson presented for \n\n inspection, a portion of the kelson of the frigate Raritan, in a \n\n state of dry rot. This vessel was still on the stocks at the \n\n Philadelphia Navy Yarchher building having been commenced \n\n at least 20 years since. She had been salted. Her lower \n\n timbers, previous to the commencement of repairs, were \n\n generally in the same condition as the portion exhibited. \n\n\n\nAlso a sample of oak joist from the old Legislative Hall, \n\n built at Chester, Pennsylvania, in 1682. Decay had not yet \n\n commenced in this wood, owing probably to its complete pro- \n\n tection from the action of moisture ; whereas in the other case, \n\n the wood was constantly subjected to the alternate action of \n\n dryness and moisture. \n\n\n\nProfessor Johnson also alluded to the hardening influence \n\n of water on oak wood when long submerged. \n\n\n\nDr. Chaloner stated that he had in his possession specimens \n\n of oak timber turned into various forms, which had been \n\n derived from a vessel, (the Lyons frigate,) submerged in the \n\n river Delaware since the period of theRevolution, and which \n\n had acquired almost the hardness of iron. \n\n\n\nProfessor Johnson then exhibited samples of residua from \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\n\n", 
"156 \n\n\n\n[March, 1842. \n\n\n\na number of Anthracite and Bituminous coal of Europe and \n\n this country, on which he had experimented wiih a view of \n\n ascertaining the relative proportions in each, of volatile mat- \n\n ter, earthy matter, and carbon. The experiments were per- \n\n formed on all in a similar manner, viz. by exposing the coal \n\n to a red heat, raised as rapidly as possible. As the moisture, \n\n however, is in such cases brought in contact with carbon at \n\n a high temperature, it may, by decomposition, cause some of \n\n the carbon to be carried off, and thus raise the estimate of the \n\n volatile matter above what it would be, if more slowly con- \n\n ducted. Incineration was conducted in a muffle, at a high \n\n and long continued temperature. \n\n\n\nThe following are the results of the analysis of some of \n\n these coals : \n\n\n\nDr. Chaloner referred to the question agitated of late \n\n among medical men, whether muscular action could excite \n\n electricity, and cited the case of a lady, described in Silli- \n\n man's Journal ; a similar instance had come under his own \n\n notice in this city. \n\n\n\n", 
"March, 1S42.] 157 \n\n\n\nAs connected with this subject, Professor Johnson mentioned \n\n that some years since, he had made experiments with a deli- \n\n cate magnet, in suspension, and discovered that by bringing \n\n the hands nearly in contact with each other, and then care- \n\n fully withdrawing them in opposite directions, the fingers of \n\n the different hands, when approximated to the magnet, pro- \n\n duced different effects. \n\n\n\nBUSINESS BY SPECIAL RESOLUTION. \n\n\n\nBy special permission, the reports of the following com- \n\n mittees were read and adopted. \n\n\n\nThe report of the committee on Dr. Morton's paper on the \n\n so-called Pigmy race of the Valley of the Mississippi, and also \n\n his paper on the ancient Peruvian race: in favour of publica- \n\n tion. \n\n\n\nThe report of the committee on Prof. Johnson's paper enti- \n\n tled \"Remarks on the relation between the Coal of South \n\n Wales and some Pennsylvania Anthracites ;\" and also his \n\n \" Description of an apparatus illustrative of the laws of Che- \n\n mical combination, and of the combining volumes of gaseous \n\n substances ;\" in favour of publication. \n\n\n\nDr. Elwyn offered the following resolution, which was \n\n adopted : \n\n\n\nResolved, That the Committee of Publication be authorised \n\n to present to Charles Lyell, Esq., Corresponding member, the \n\n sixth volume of the Journal of the Academy. \n\n\n\n",

A list was likewise given of various insects and \n\n animals, which he was desirous of exchanging for similar ob- \n\n jects of this country : \n\n\n\nAnd from George R.

Stevens and Catherwood, that these latter had \n\n discovered the remains of another city, covering an area of \n\n about six miles square. \n\n\n\nThe ruins were in a good state of preservation ; and some \n\n specimens of sculpture brought thence by him, evince marks \n\n of much skill and beauty. \n\n\n\nThe beam of wood referred to in Stevens's Central America, \n\n and found in the ruins of Uxmal, was stated to be well pre- \n\n served. The tree from which the wood is derived, is called \n\n by the natives Zapadillo. It is more durable than live oak \n\n or red cedar, sinks in water, and when polished, resembles \n\n Partridge wood,' but is darker and harder. \n\n\n\n", 
"Mat, 1S42.] 169 \n\n\n\nDr. Chaloner made inquiry with regard to some Infusoria \n\n said to have been discovered in the green sediment of pools ; \n\n and which are stated to possess the peculiar property of evolv- \n\n ing oxygen gas under the influence of the sun's rays. \n\n\n\nWhen examined by the microscope, they rose to the sur- \n\n face, emitted a bubble of gas and then subsided. This gas, \n\n collected in an inverted jar, was found on analysis to yield \n\n about 80 per cent, of oxygen. \n\n\n\nDr. B. H. Coates then made some remarks on the progress \n\n of discovery in relation to this class of animals ; and called the \n\n attention of the members to the late work of Mr. Pritchard, \n\n and communicated some of the information which he had \n\n derived from this author. \n\n\n\nDr. Bridges remarked that, in relation to the first mentioned \n\n discovery, in the absence of more definite information, the \n\n facts which had been communicated would lead us to suppose \n\n that the subjects of observation were of a vegetable nature ; \n\n since it is well known that vegetables under the influence of \n\n the sun's rays, evolve oxygen by the decomposition of car- \n\n bonic acid, which is always present in the atmosphere and in \n\n water. He also alluded to the difficulty of discrimination \n\n between animal and vegetable bodies, especially in micros- \n\n copic objects, and made reference to a paper on the Sponge, \n\n in one of the late numbers of the Transactions of the Linnean \n\n Society, to illustrate the great accuracy of observation re- \n\n quired in these cases. \n\n\n\nBUSINESS BY SPECIAL RESOLUTION. \n\n\n\nThe following resolution was adopted : \n\n\n\nResolved, That the Sth Vol. of the Journal of the Academy \n\n be presented to M. de Longchamps. \n\n\n\n",

S. Haideman, read Feb. 1, 1842, re- \n\n ported in favour of publication in the Proceedings of the \n\n Academy. \n\n\n\nA spirit of selfishness has crept into Zoology, which looks rather to the advan- \n\n tage of the individual, than to the advancement of ihe science ; and authors, with \n\n the former point in view, have invented various methods to carry out the princi- \n\n ple ; and, what is worse, authority brings those to practice them, who would \n\n have been shocked at the idea of using them in the first instance. Among these, \n\n I count the practice of citing one's own name for a genus or species founded by \n\n another, on the strength of varying a single letter, or even the gender. Examples \n\n of this occur in the writings of Rafinesque. If this is proper, a printer may as- \n\n sume the authoiship of a book in which he finds and corrects grammatical errors. \n\n Admit the principal that Unio metanevra, Kaf. shall be called U. metannever, \n\n Lea : and the French will have our own authority to assume almost every species \n\n of American Unio, because they consider them as of the feminine gender, whilst \n\n they have been described here as masculine ; and any one not a botanist, may \n\n place the species of Potamogston (heretofore considered neuter) in the feminine \n\n gender to which it belongs, as has been ascertained from a passage in Pliny. \n\n\n\nHaving recently looked over the list of American Unionidffi, I wish to propose \n\n a few corrections in nomenclature, before they arc made, and the species appro- \n\n priated abroad, by someone who will not cite the original desciiber. A western con- \n\n cbologist gives all the species of Alasmodon to Mr. Lea, not because he was the \n\n first to name them, to create thegenu, or to place them in it; but because he places \n\n them in the same genus with those who first described them, but under a differ- \n\n\n\n", 
"May, 1S42.] 177 \n\n\n\nent name, which has neither priority nor sense to recommend it ; and which, \n\n under other circumstances, this author would probably have rejected, if we may \n\n judge from the fact that he adopts the names Physa and Planorbis, rather than \n\n Bulinus and Coretus. The same principle would deprive Mr. Lea of all his spe- \n\n cies of Alasmodon ; for assuredly authors will not adopt Shumacher's name (or \n\n this genus, when so much a better one is in general use. Generic nomenclature \n\n is not, and never has been, subjected to the rigid rule of priority which species \n\n require; and a name founded upon the generic peculiarity will generally be adop- \n\n ted in preference to others. A fossil animal with a head unlike that of a bird, was \n\n named Omithocephalus ; it is now called Pterod ictylus. A remarkable mammal \n\n with flat feet, and a bill like that of a bird, was first named Platypus, but is now- \n\n known by the name Ornithorhynchus* alone. \n\n\n\nTo put these matters to the test. I propose that the letter u shall take the place \n\n of iv in the specific name of Unio Cowperianus of Lea, this gentleman having \n\n committed an error in the orthography. To suit the views of those who do not \n\n like the appearance of a name with the termination anus following a genitive, I \n\n propose that Couperii be adopted instead of the above. There is an \" Anodonta \n\n Cowperiana\" which I do not correct, because I wish merely to discuss a princi- \n\n ple. I propose that all the species of the genus Alasmoiionj- or Alasmodonta, be \n\n called by one of these names; and that the hybrid specific name of Unio Nash- \n\n villianus be changed into the more correct and classical one of Nashvicensis. Fi- \n\n nally, I disclaim all citation for these proposition*, as I think it would be the \n\n height of absurdity to cite any one for species he does not know. \n\n\n\nIn relation to the communication of Dr. A. Clapp, of New \n\n Albany, Indiana, read March 8th, 1S42, the Committee con- \n\n sisting of Mr. Conrad, Prof. Rogers and Mr. Vanuxem, re- \n\n ported the following for publication in the Proceedings: \n\n\n\nA letter was read from Dr. A. Clapp of New Albany, Indiana, dated February \n\n 25ih, in relation to the Geological equivalents of the rocks of the Falls of the \n\n Ohio, and other strata in the Western States. \n\n\n\nThe author states, that, the'e appears to be little or no true carboniferous lime- \n\n stone east of the Falls of the Ohio. The stratum which he doubtfully referred to \n\n it, in a previous letter of December, 1840, viz the Oolitic and Pentremile lime- \n\n stone of Professor Troost and Dr. Owen, he is now convinced is the carboniferous \n\n limestone, commencing a short distance west of New Albany, and underlying the \n\n coal formation in the western part of Indiana, part of Kentucky and Illinois. It \n\n is entirely wanting in Ohio. \n\n\n\nHe refers to his previous communication of April last, as showing that the \n\n limestone of the Falls of the Ohio, the cliff limestone of Professor Locke, does \n\n not belong to the Carboniferous, but to the Upper Siluiian System of Murchison. \n\n The limestone of the Falls immediately underlies the black bituminous slate, \n\n which appears to be the equivalent of the Marcellus shales of New York. The \n\n lower strata of the Falls have many fossils of the Weulock limestone, but the \n\n\n\n* The middle h is sometimes omitted, as it was by Linneus in his genus Ryn- \n\n chops. Is the first author who made the omission, and he who first wrote Rliyn- \n\n chops, entitled to these genera, with their species ? In a notice of Kiener's work, \n\n in the Re\\U' Zoologique, this author is censured for writing \" Pleurotonia mitrs% \n\n formis Fell,\" Wond having previously used the specific name \" mitrj'formis.\" \n\n\n\nj This ;s the more correct form, and corresponds with .Mono.

The lower and \n\n middle portions of the Cliff limestone, he conjectures to be equivalents of the Ni- \n\n agara limestone and Gypseous shales : the entire mass called the Cliff limestone, \n\n represents therefore the Niagara limestone, Gypseous shales, water-lime, Ononda- \n\n ga limestone, &c. to the Marcellus shales. Under the name Cliff limestone is \n\n here included all the group above the blue limestone and marls of Cincinnati, to \n\n the black slate. It is the western continuation of the middle Silurian series of \n\n Mr. Conrad. \n\n\n\nThe water-lime of the Falls of the Ohio, is a drab-coloured rock, from ten to \n\n fourteen feet thick, covered by a subcrystalline foetid limestone eight feet thick, \n\n containing Enerini, a Conu/aria, Delthyris and Favosites, and a few other co- \n\n rals, and immediately underlies the black slate. In mast places the water-lime is \n\n entirely destitute of organic remains ; the few which occur belong to the lower \n\n Ludlow and Amestry of Murchison, as Orthis hmata vel reticularis, leptxna \n\n lata ? Turbo carinatus, Terebra sinuosa, Tentaculites, perhaps a new species, \n\n Avicula reticulata, Calymene bufo, Aaaphus Micrurus; several undetermined \n\n species of Delthyris, an Eschara, &c. \n\n\n\nIn the strata below the water-lime were f mnd many fossils of the Wenlock \n\n limestone, Strophomena euglypha, Atrypa prisca, the latter also occurring in \n\n the water-lime and upper limestone; Pleurorynchtts cureous? of Conrad, and \n\n an immense profusion of Polyparia, characteristic of the Wenlock limestone. \n\n\n\nThe Catamepora occurs below the main mass of the corals, and thirty or forty \n\n feet below the water-lime. It would therefore appear, that the water-lime belongs \n\n to the middle or upper part of the Hederburg group, and cannot represent the \n\n Onondaga salt group of Mr. Hall. \n\n\n\nThe author expresses a doubt of the identity of the black bituminous slate of \n\n Ohio, with the Ludlowville group of Mr. Hall, as supposed by that gentleman. \n\n Though the shales and sandstone in the vicinity of New Albany, for more than \n\n four hundred feet above the black slate, are destitute of fossils, except a few in- \n\n distinct Fucoides, yet sixteen miles south, in Kentucky, great quantities of Cri- \n\n noidiea occur, fifty or one hundred feet above the slate; and an Orthis which \n\n Mr. Hall consideis identical with a species of the Ludlowville shale of New York. \n\n\n\nELECTION. \n\n\n\nM.

"182 [June, 1842. \n\n\n\nthe evidence which the recent accounts from the West Indies \n\n furnish, of the general correctness of the hypothesis, originally \n\n advanced by Michell, in the Philosophical Transactions for \n\n 1760, that the movement of the earth in earthquakes is undu- \n\n latory. That such is the nature of the motion may be con- \n\n sidered indeed as established, both from observation in many \n\n regions of the globe, and from instrumental investigations \n\n now in progress in Scotland. Professor Rogers proposes to \n\n explain the billowy oscillation of the ground, by actual waves \n\n engendered on the surface of the great fluid lava-mass, sup- \n\n posed to occupy the whole interior of the globe ; and he ac- \n\n counts for the waves, by the sudden or explosive escape of \n\n highly compressed vapours, by the rending of the crust, or \n\n through other outlets. \n\n\n\nHe suggested to the Society the importance of procuring, \n\n through correspondence on the part of members, some more \n\n detailed and accurate statements than have yet appeared in the \n\n public prints, in relation to the phenomena of the late shocks \n\n in the West Indies ; as regards, \n\n\n\nFirst. The extent of the earthquake ; whether it reached \n\n the mainland of South America, and to what distance north- \n\n ward from Porto Rico and St. Domingo it was felt at sea. \n\n\n\nSecondly.

The precise time at each locality of the occur- \n\n rence of the first shock, and of each principal succeeding one. \n\n\n\nFourthly. Whether the cloud of vapour reported to have \n\n been seen at Port Plate, on the north-east coast of St. Domin- \n\n go, was actually such, or merely dust, caused by disturbance \n\n of the soil or the crushing of falling buildings. \n\n\n\n",

Body short, irregular in outline, back but slightly convex, \n\n meeting the head at a slight depression, and the posterior extremity with a curve \n\n of a quarter of a circle ; posterior margin running downwards and forwards, with \n\n a rounded projection opposite the head ; ventral margin very convex. Colour, \n\n brown ; length, 2 millim. Hab. Ditches along the Susquehanna. \n\n\n\nLiMNADrA coriacea. Body lengthened; swimming branchiae extending along \n\n three-fourths of the inferior surface, from the neck to the extremity of the tail; \n\n tail crested above with a row of large conical obtuse tubercles ; apex of the shell \n\n elevated, and about one-fourth of the length from the anterior extremity ; colour, \n\n light brown; length 5 millim., height 3, diam. 1^. Hab. Ditches along the Sus- \n\n quehanna, in quiet water. \n\n\n\nObs. The shell is coriaceous and translucent, and bears a slight resemblance \n\n to Mesodesma Jauresii. It is not a little singular that the same generic and spe- \n\n cific name, Limnadia gigas, should have been applied both to a crustacean and \n\n a mollusc, each of which has a bivalve shell, andinhabits fresh water. \n\n\n\nHydrachna scabra. Subglobose, dull vermillion red, displaying a rough papil- \n\n lated surface under the microscope ; legs ciliated, some of the bristles extremely \n\n long; claws simple, retractile ; length 1| millim. Hab. Quiet waters along the \n\n Susquehanna. Swims well, and occasionally leaves the water for the damp earth. \n\n\n\nHydrachna bundata. Subglobular, light ochraceous, clouded with light yellowish \n\n brown ; there are five blood-red spots, placed respectively between the eyes, at the \n\n posterior extremity, upon the margin of each side, and in the middle of the body; \n\n legs long, slender, and ciliated. Length 1 millim. Extremely active, swimming \n\n through the water with great rapidity. Occurs with the preceding species. \n\n\n\nDescription of a new species of Cypris. By S. S.

H. nebulosa, and H. cocci- \n\n nea ; and of one Daphnia, D. reticulata,\" which was referred \n\n to a committee, consisting of Drs. Goddard, McMurtrie and \n\n Pickering. \n\n\n\nVERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. \n\n\n\nProfessor Johnson made some remarks on the determination \n\n of copper in analysis. He stated that the usual mode was to pre- \n\n cipitate the protoxide from solution; that in this case, it is neces- \n\n ary that an excess of alkali should be added, and the precipitate \n\n well washed. It is also attended by a loss in filtering, &c. \n\n By using dry sulphate of copper these objections are obviated. \n\n This salt is readily dried without decomposition; and Professor \n\n Johnson stated that with the same portion of copper he re- \n\n peated an experiment several times, and had found this mode \n\n of determination more satisfactory than that by the oxide, and \n\n with less variation in result. \n\n\n\nMr. Haldeman then made the following remarks. \n\n\n\nFrom the great number of generic names required in Zoolo- \n\n\n\n27 \n\n\n\n", 
"188 [July, 1842. \n\n\n\ngy and Botany, it frequently happens that the same name will \n\n occur, not only in both these sciences, but will be occasionally \n\n used for different genera in one or the other kingdom. No \n\n principle is perhaps better established than that which denies \n\n the same name to different genera ; and it is necessary, there- \n\n fore, that those concerned in the construction of generic \n\n nomenclature, should look over the names already instituted, \n\n as a safeguard against a double emploi. Thus Cenchrus and \n\n Apogon are genera in both kingdoms. \n\n\n\nI wish, therefore, to propose a few changes in the names \n\n of several genera, viz : \n\n\n\nAnojmia, instead of Harpyia, Cuv., for a genus of birds, the \n\n latter name being preoccupied, both in Mammalogy and En- \n\n tomology. \n\n\n\nOplacerus, instead of Mazama, Smith ; this name having \n\n been pre-applied to Ovis or Capra montana, Ord, by Rafin- \n\n esque. \n\n\n\nSargus, was long since applied to a genus of dipterous in- \n\n sects by Illiger : Cuvier more recently, upon dismembering \n\n the genus Sparus of Artedi and Linnaaus, improperly adopted \n\n it for the typical section, to which, therefore, the original \n\n name Sparus must be applied. \n\n\n\nLynx, (a subgenus of Felis,) was published by Rafinesque \n\n in 1817, and I believe has the priority of Lynchus, which is \n\n also the name of a genus of Crustacea. \n\n\n\nSTATED MEETING, July 12, 1842. \n\n Mr. Phillips in the Chair. \n\n\n\nDONATIONS TO MUSEUM. \n\n\n\nA specimen of Canis latrans, (prairie wolf,) from Illinois; of \n\n Crocodilus lucius (adult size;) and of Talpa Europsea, from \n\n the Alps.

"July, 1842.] l^J \n\n\n\nIn continuation of my observations on the use of the same name for different \n\n genera, I would remark that it is possible, in many instances, to vary the later \n\n one so slightly, that it would be essentially the same; and, to prevent confusion, \n\n the name of the author who instituted the genus, might be cited for it.* These \n\n variations might take place either in the orthography, in the gender, or by a \n\n diminitive. Linnams himself has set us an example, in applying such names as \n\n Picus and Pica to distinct genera of birds. \n\n\n\nBut in making changes of this kind, it is very necessary to be careful that great \n\n confusion be not the result. Thus, Bonaparte has proposed ' Pogonathus, Bon.\" \n\n in place of\" Pogonias, Cuv.\" because the latter is applied to a genus of birds. Yet \n\n if we turn to the Regne Animal, we will find \" Pogonias' Lacep.\" We do not, \n\n however, find Pogonias in Lacepede, the name being Pogonathus. \n\n\n\nI propose Ancyllus and Teronyx, instead of Ancylus and Trionyx, for genera of \n\n Hymenoptera. \n\n\n\nConoura, Eucryptus and Auchenella, instead of Conurus, Cryptus, (Hal.) and \n\n Auchenia, for genera of insects. \n\n\n\nClypastrsea and Strong ulus, instead of Clypeaster and Strongylus, for coleopte- \n\n rous genera. \n\n\n\nCymindus, instead of Cymindis, for a genus of birds; and Labeola instead of \n\n Labeo, for a genus of insects. There are many other names employed for dis- \n\n tinct genera ; thus Chione, Venilia, Cleodora, Pandora, Hyria and Lucina, are \n\n common to conchology and entomology ; Sylvia and Tanagra to the latter and \n\n ornithology ; and Labeo and Zytena to entomology and ichthyology. \n\n\n\nThe following \" Note on the Natural Alliances of the genus \n\n Cecidomyia, intended to facilitate identification ;\" was read by \n\n Dr. B. H. Coates, and referred to a committee, viz. : Dr. \n\n McMurtrie, Dr. Pickering, and Mr. Haldeman ; who reported \n\n it for publication in the Proceedings of the Academy. \n\n\n\nNothing new is professed to be furnished by the present paragraphs. They are \n\n compiled from sources not difficult of access among the liberal collections of this \n\n city ; but it has been hoped that some utility could be derived from preserving and \n\n more widely diffusing a memorandum of the^alliances of this destructive family of \n\n insects, so as to increase the number and practicability of observations on the part \n\n of those favourably situated for that purpose. \n\n\n\nThe old Linnean genus, Tipula, is, I believe, a natural one. It is, at all events, \n\n one of a striking appearance. A delicate, lightly framed, two winged fly, of a \n\n form much resembling the moschito, frequently capable of resting and dancing on \n\n running streams of water, so as to attract popular attention by the circumstance, \n\n and at the same time unable to inflict severe and penetrating wounds on the bodies \n\n of warm-blooded animals, from the feebleness of its proboscis. This organ would \n\n seem, in general, only fitted for sucking up uncovered or but slightly covered fluids ; \n\n and contains, to use the language of one of the best authorities, only a pair of lan- \n\n cets ; being, in this respect, very deficient when compared with the allied family, \n\n Culicida;. The antennae, with the exception of a single sub-family, are thread- \n\n shaped. The perfect insect shows but little avidity for food. \n\n\n\nFive natural groups seem to arise; in each of which the appearance of the per- \n\n\n\n* Cuvier writes \" Machoera, Lacep.\" but this genus stands Makaira, in \n\n Lacepede's work, and it is the more necessary to retain the original orthography, \n\n as Machcerahas been recently applied to a genus of Mollusca. \n\n\n\nIV \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", 
"192 [July, 1842. \n\n\n\nfeet insect visibly differs, and the habits of the larva vary materially in respect to \n\n food and habitation. We copy some of the characters. \n\n\n\n1. Chirnomides. Aquatic Tipulides. Male antennae plumose ; larva) aquatic. \n\n\n\n2. Tipulides proper. Terrestrial Tipulides. Head elongated into a muzzle; \n\n no ocelli ; larva? inhabit the earth. \n\n\n\n3. Mycetophilides. Tipulides of fungi. Two or three ocelli ; trochanters \n\n elongated ; tibiae strongly spurred ; larva? feed on fungi. \n\n\n\n4. Cecidomyides. Tipulides of gall-nuts. Head not prolonged into a muzzle ; \n\n no ocelli ; trochanters of ordinary length ; antenna? moniliform ; larva? feed in \n\n galls formed on vegetable substances. \n\n\n\n5. Bibionides. Tipulides of flowers. Antenna? short, perfoliatcd, generally fewer \n\n than 12 joints ; legs of ordinary length ; larva? often resident in rotten dung \n\n and vegetable debris. [To me, this seems contradictory.] \n\n\n\nThe above classification is quoted from M. Latreille ; and is preferred by the \n\n author whom I have already cited, and whom I believe to be Mr. Westwood. The \n\n less extensive knowledge of the species possessed in the years when Messrs. Meigen \n\n and Lamarck wrote, prevented their distribution of the family from being, at that \n\n time, so perfect. They are compelled, in this place, to follow a more artificial \n\n method ; and have thus brought in close approximation some animals whose mode \n\n of life has subsequently been thought to differ. It has since been thought to be \n\n rendered evident, that the larva? of the proper tipulida?, at least as a general rule, \n\n live on the roots of plants. Among the authorities cited for this are Kirby and \n\n Spcnce. \n\n\n\nIt is evident that the natural affinities of Cecidomyia, are with the sub-family \n\n to which it has given its name. It has been approximated to Lasioptera. The \n\n latter is a genus with terrestrial larva?, living on roots ; and the parent, according \n\n to professor Meigen, not furnished with an ovipositor. The figures, too, given by \n\n the latter writer as specimens of the genera, differ in their habitus. In the earlier \n\n state of knowledge in relation to the tipulide tribe, and particularly while the lar- \n\n va? were less known, the collocation of several species was doubtful. Mr. Meigen \n\n is said to place the tipula juniperina L., which inhabits the tops of the juniper, \n\n \" doubtfully in Lasioptera.\" 1 understand the words \" unbekannte horde,\" under \n\n which he introduces this species, to mean \" unknown, or ill-understood horde,\" or \n\n \" unknown, ill-defined group.\" \n\n\n\nit is observed that every larva of the family, thus fur, appears to consume solid \n\n substances by chewing, and, as a necessary inference, to possess real jaws; instead \n\n of sucking by a trunk, as has been, in this country, universally affirmed of the \n\n species so frequently the subject of popular discussion. The consideration goes to \n\n strengthen, if possible, the inference that the quiescent substance generally sup- \n\n posed, in imitation of Mr. Say, to be the larva of the Hessian fly, and which, by \n\n the avowal of that distinguished writer, so closely resembles the pupa, is really the \n\n pupa in an earlier stage, and that the larva is to be looked for in the maxillated \n\n and gnawing worm. \n\n\n\nIt appears to be every where observed, that as soon as these animals increase \n\n to a certain extent, their further diffusion is immediately limited by the ravages \n\n of the different parasites of the families Chalcidida? and Proctotrupida?. The \n\n coincidence of these diminutions, from a cause not generally understood, with \n\n various other circumstances affecting the wheat crops, probably gives reputation \n\n to many other supposed means, natural and artificial, of destroying the injurious \n\n\n\nThe Corresponding Secretary read several letters from Mr. \n\n Couper, of Georgia, addressed to Dr. Harlan of this city, in \n\n\n\n",

"196 [July, 1842. \n\n\n\nMEETING FOR BUSINESS, July 26, 1842. \n\n\n\nVice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nAfter the reading of the Monthly Report of the Corrrespond- \n\n ing Secretary, the following reports of committees were pre- \n\n sented and adopted. \n\n\n\nThe Committee on the following paper by Mr. Haldeman, \n\n read July 5th, 1842, in favour of Publication in the Proceed- \n\n ings. \n\n\n\nDescription of two new species of Hydrachna and one of \n\n Daphnia. By S. S. Haldeman. \n\n\n\nHydr. nebulosa. Globular, mottled with brown ; a large central sub-rectangu- \n\n lar spot back of the eyes, which are apparently double upon each side, red and \n\n black ; an orange spot in the centre of the back ; legs very slender, first and \n\n second pair thinner than the third and fourth ; palpi long, basal half cylindrical, \n\n extremity tapering. More globular than my Unionicola oviformis, with a nearly \n\n similar light Y shaped mark upon the back, and equalling this species in size. \n\n Hab. A little pond on the Susquehanna, above Columbia. \n\n\n\nHydr. coccinea. Subglobose, uniform bright scarlet, legs slender, covered with \n\n short bristles ; palpi bristled, ante-penultimate articulation thickened. Length 4 \n\n millim. Hab. with the preceding. Differs from H. scabra, in being larger, and \n\n in wanting the long bristles to the legs. The posterior legs are not \" destitute of \n\n cilia,\" wherein it differs from Limnochares cxtendens, Say. \n\n\n\nDaphnia reticulata. Ovate, margins imbricated, surface divided by fine lines \n\n into minute rectangles; posterior half of the body with the dorsal and ventral por- \n\n tion approaching each other by similar curves, which meet in a long, slender, \n\n tapering caudal appendage. Closely resembles \" Monocculus pulex.\" Jurine's \n\n Hist, des Monocles, PI. 8. fig. 1. Length 1 millim. Hab. with the preceding. \n\n\n\nThe Committee on Professor Locke's communication, read \n\n July 5th, 1842, on the Fossil Cryptolithus tesselatus, re- \n\n ported also in favour of publication in the Proceedings ; viz : \n\n\n\nSo rarely do we meet with Fossils in such a state that we can unravel in any \n\n degree the structure beyond the mere external form, that I sit down while the \n\n subject is still new and exciting, to communicate to you what seems to me to be a \n\n discovery in relation to the Cryptolithus tessellatus. This fossil is so seldom found \n\n with anything more than the scuta and its ornamented margin, that some natu- \n\n ralists have doubted the existence of an \" abdomen\" and \" tail,\" similar to the cor- \n\n responding parts of other trilobites. In examining a stratum of clay-marl which \n\n\n\n", 
"July, 1842.] 197 \n\n\n\nconstitutes, perhaps, a hundred feet in thickness of our horizontal strata, the fos- \n\n sils were found to be merely imbedded, without petrefaction, and easily separable \n\n from the fine, soft, earthy matter. In this condition, they exhibit a freshness and \n\n sharpness highly interesting to the student. Within the last week, Mr^sJames \n\n Foster, an amateur collector of our city, discovered in this marl several specimens \n\n of the above fossil, with the body entire. Soon after, Mr. Anthony and myself \n\n found other specimens of the same. The new facts disclosed by these specimens \n\n and by others found in this vicinity, are 1st. That the animal was furnished when \n\n entire, with very long spines or processes from the posterior angles of the shield. \n\n 2d. The abdomen is partly concealed, about five articulations, under the poste- \n\n rior half of the shield. 3d. The middle lobe of the shield is posteriorly mucro- \n\n nate. The first fact is fully exhibited in a specimen in Mr. Foster's cabinet ; the \n\n second fact in a specimen of my own, in which the shield lias separated from the \n\n body, disclosing the articulations beneath ; the third fact in two specimens be- \n\n longing to Mr. Foster. The middle lobe of the abdomen is about half the width \n\n of the lateral lobes, and shows only five or six articulations uncovered by the shield. \n\n The tail is very distinct from the abdomen, with about five obscure articulations. \n\n Mr. Anthony has a specimen, which by a fracture of the shield, discloses seven \n\n abdominal articulations, and the whole number is probably ten. It is evident, \n\n from this structure, that when the animal rolled itself in the manner of the trilo- \n\n bite family, the whole body would be concealed under the shield. The posterior \n\n part of the body is circumscribed by a well defined raised margin. \n\n\n\nThe associated fossils are Strophomcna alternata, Atrypa tcstudinaria, Lingula \n\n\n\n, Orbicula, Isotelus megistos, Calymene senaria, Grthocerce, Enchrinites and \n\n\n\nCorallines. Formation, \" Blue limestone,\" Trenton Limestone of the N. Y. \n\n Geologists, or a formation above it. \n\n\n\nThe Committee, to whom was referred the communication \n\n of P. A. Browne, Esq., describing a \" monstrous Rose,\" made \n\n a report, stating that the difference in the character of this \n\n paper from the usual one of those inserted in the Journal cr \n\n Proceedings, and the necessity for the aid of a plate for its \n\n complete elucidation, rendered its publication, in its entire form, \n\n impracticable. \n\n\n\nThe following, however, being the concluding portion of the \n\n paper, containing some strictures on terms used in Vegetable \n\n Physiology, the Committee recommended for publication in \n\n the Proceedings. \n\n\n\nIt remains only to note, that when botanists inculcate the doctrine to which \n\n allusion has been made above,* they make use of terms that are illy adapted to \n\n convey their meaning. \" A flower\" they say, \" is a transformed branch : all its \n\n organs being leaves, which have undergone a peculiar metamorphosis ,\"t by which \n\n we would understand that nature first formed a branch, and afterwards converted \n\n\n\n* The present theory, of the flower being' the product of successive whorls of \n\n leaves. \n\n\n\nt Gray's Botany, p, 158, \n\n\n\n", 
"198 [July, 1842' \n\n\n\nit progressively into a calyx, a corolla, stamens and pistils ; whereas they do not \n\n intend to be understood that these parts ever existed as branches or leaves, but \n\n that their nature and origin are the same. And this being the case, why are the \n\n wordslfrtransformed,\" and \" metamorphosed\" used at all ? Terms should never be \n\n used in science with different meanings from that in which they are generally \n\n understood, if it can possibly be avoided. \n\n\n\n! It is the opinion of some eminent botanists, that the same vegetable matter \n\n which, called into action on the earth, with sufficient light, air, &c. produces a \n\n Lichen, will, in moisture on decaying organised substances become a Fungus ; \n\n or if developed under water, exhibit the form of an Alga. But this has not been \n\n considered a sufficient warrant for the assertion, that one of these is transformed \n\n or is metamorphosed into the other. \n\n\n\nThis erroneous mode of expression is peculiarly conspicuous in regard to the \n\n present specimen, since it conveys the idea that the leaves were first transformed \n\n into calyx, corolla, stamens and pistils, and were afterwards by a retrograde move- \n\n ment metamorphosed back again into leaves ; when in truth all we mean to assert \n\n is, that owing to the peculiar circumstances attending the developement of the \n\n flower, the vegetable matter which was called into action, never arrived at the \n\n stage of perfection required for these more perfect organs, and that therefore they \n\n remained leaves. \n\n\n\nThe Society then proceeded to an election for Correspon- \n\n dents of the xA.cademy, with the following result. \n\n\n\nCORRESPONDENTS. \n\n\n\nProfessor John A.

Dr. M. remarked that these bones have pertained to a \n\n female, whose stature has not exceeded five feet three inches, at the same time \n\n ih;it the absence of epiphyses and consequent consolidation of the bones ar< \n\n proof- of adult a'.*e. From the appearance of the teeth, however, which art \n\n fresh, and not sensibly worn, and a line or furrow marking off the crista of the \n\n ilium, it is pies Um ed that this individual had not passed her twentieth year. \n\n The bones of the head, which are still partially separable at the sutures, are \n\n admirably characteristic of the American Race, as seen in the vertical occiput \n\n and the 'jreat inter-parietal diameter, which measures five inches and ei^ht- \n\n tenths. The head is of full size, in proportion to the rest of the skeleton, ol \n\n which the bones are of very delicate proportions, especially those of the fee; \n\n and hands. An interesting feature of this skeleton is, the occurrence of a \n\n large spongy node on the upper and inner surface of the left tibia, on which \n\n it extends about two inches in length, one inch in breadth, and halt an inch \n\n in thicki ess. Dr. Bridges having subjected some fragments of these bone- \n\n\n\n", 
"204 [August, 1842. \n\n\n\n10 the usual chemical tests, found them in a very great degree deprived of \n\n animal matter an additional evidence of their antiquity. \n\n\n\nDr. Morton also exhibited parts of four other skeletons, obtained also in \n\n Yucatan, by Mr. Benjamin A. Norman, during a recent sojourn in that coun- \n\n try. They were found in mounds near the sea-coast; but on a closer examin- \n\n ation, it was ascertained by that gentleman that these mounds had been \n\n pyramids of mason work, which, by gradual disintegration, and subsequent \n\n deposits of vegetable matter, had been reduced to the low, conical, or mound- \n\n like lorm. One of these skeletons is that of a man of perhaps five and twenty \n\n years ol age; the bones, which are chiefly those of the extremities, are large, \n\n and indicate a person of full stature. The few remaining cranial bones are' \n\n large and massive, which remark also applies to both maxilla?, in which the \n\n teeth are remarkably perfect. The os calcis and other bones of the foot are \n\n of delicate proportions. Parts of a second skeleton from the same mound \n\n are smaller, but so few, and so much broken, as to prevent any certain indi- \n\n cations of age or sex. \n\n\n\nOf the two remaining skeletons, only a few fragments of long bones and \n\n others of the hands and feet remain. These are much larger than those \n\n already described, and have probably pertained to men of large stature. No \n\n remains of cranial bones were found among them. These fragments were \n\n not tested for the animal matter they may contain; but, judging from their \n\n extreme disintegration, it must have almost wholly disappeared. \n\n\n\nMr. Gliddon remarked, on the authority of Mr. Stephens, \n\n that an examination of the sepulchre, and of the mode in \n\n which these remains had been interred, totally disproved \n\n any idea of their being of Egyptian origin or character. \n\n\n\nBUSINESS BY SPECIAL RESOLUTION. \n\n\n\nOn motion of Dr. Morton, Resolved, That the Catalogue \n\n accompanying Mr. P. A. Browne's donation of West Indian \n\n plants, &c, be bound, and deposited in the Library of the \n\n Academy. \n\n\n\n",

He referred \n\n ;o tin 1 faci that, in early periods of the use of copper fur sheathing the bot- \n\n toms of vessels, while iron bolts were still used for fastenings, the copper \n\n lasted much I > >t than al present, while the iron itself was rapidly corn de I; \n\n thai pper bolts having been substituted for iron ones, the sheathing exhi- \n\n bited :i much more rapid decay than befi .>. He likewise alluded i<> the fact \n\n that the practice of fastening on sheathing copper with composition nails, \n\n oilers an antagonist electric force to thai i*t' the copper, rendering the latter \n\n more highly electro-positive, and thus facilitating its union with the electro- \n\n negative elements of sea water. It was also mentioned, that in removing the \n\n copper from ships some sheets are often found much more corroded than the \n\n rest, and that this takes place among sheets manufactured at the same works, \n\n and apparently with equal care in freeing the metal from impurities. \n\n\n\nIt v as further mentioned tiiat long experience had evinced the uncertainty \n\n if obtaining durable copper by efforts to approximate chemical purity in the \n\n manufacture, and that in copper free from other meinls the oxide of copper \n\n is sometimes detected both in the interior and on the exterior of the mass, \n\n rendering it earihv in appearance, and liable to be disintegrated as well as \n\n corroded. In proof of this latter effect he exhibited a quantity of copper \n\n particles brushed from a sheet o\\ that metal which had been worn 'several \n\n feare between the keel and the false keel of an English s| U op of war, where, \n\n though ihe salt water could penetrate and corrode it, the disintegrated parti- \n\n cles coul I not be reached by the waves to be washed away. \n\n\n\nA> the comparative electric energy of two sheets of copper is proportion \n\n to the amount of corrosion going en, and as the quantity of electricity i \n\n motion also determines the influence of its current on a magnetic needle, the \n\n leflection id' that of a common galvanometer may be made to determin \n\n relation of two sheets to each other, and thus io ascertain whether they are \n\n uitable to lie associated together on the bottom of ihe same vessel. \n\n\n\nTwo methods v. ere described and illn- trated by h hich this may I\"' accom- \n\n plished. The fust is to oppose iii succession the several sheets of copper t>> \n\n a .sheet of platina constituting the negative element of the pair, and observing \n\n\n\n",

It will be reserved for \n\n the first part of the next volume of the Journal of the Aca- \n\n demy. For the present, therefore, the Committee are only \n\n enabled to give the following, being the concluding portion \n\n of the paper.] \n\n\n\nThe fossil bones of the terrestrial mammalia* were found in the bed of the \n\n canal, at the southern end of this swamp, at six different points extending up \n\n from its junction with the salt marsh to a distance of three miles. In \n\n every instance they were found at the bottom of the alluvial deposit, imbed- \n\n ded in it, and lying on the stratum of sand. The first two feet of the allu- \n\n vial formation is a sandy loam, gradually passing into a compact clay of a \n\n ferruginous character, which extends three or four feet deeper. In this \n\n stratum of clay thin veins of marl and fragments of petrified wood were \n\n found at different depths : but no fossil shells, either of marine or fresh \n\n water origin. The stratum of sand on which the bones were found lying \n\n is on an average nearly five feet above spring tides. About the line of \n\n\n\n* The most interesting of these bones belong to the Megatherium, the \n\n Mastodon giganteum, Elephas primogenius, Hippopotamus, Horse, Bos, and \n\n to a nondescript animal, which Dr. Harlan has described as the Sus Ameri- \n\n cana, in Silliman's Journal, for July, 1842. \n\n\n\n", 
"November, 1842.] 217 \n\n\n\nhigh water the sand changes its color from yellow to white, and assumes \n\n a quicksand character, which it retains for one or two feet, when it is suc- \n\n ceeded by a coarser and sharper sand, with the occasional occurrence of \n\n thin strata of foetid black mud or clay. Small masses of marine fossil \n\n shells,* lying horizontally, or nearly so, are found scattered at intervals \n\n throughout this sandy formation, at almost every point of the canal. The \n\n depth varies from five feet above to five feet below the line of high tides, \n\n which is the greatest depth to which the excavation has extended. \n\n\n\nThe rib and vertebra of the whale were discovered near the northern \n\n extremity of the swamp, in the yellow sand, and about a foot below its sur- \n\n face. They were much worn, and one of the vertebra was much incrusted \n\n with barnacles. At this point bog iron ore and protophosphate of iron \n\n were found above the sand containing the marine shells. \n\n\n\nThe precise spot where the extinct Chelonia (C. Couperi of Harlan) \n\n occurred was not ascertained; but there is every probability that it was \n\n taken from the same formation. \n\n\n\nThe bones of the mammalia occurred generally in groups; and in some \n\n cases a large number of those of the same skeleton were found together. \n\n From this circumstance and the unworn and perfect state of many of the \n\n bones, it is highly probable that the carcasses of the animals were floated, \n\n or fell into the then lake or stream, and that, sinking to the sandy bottom, \n\n they were gradually covered to their present depth by the deposits of the \n\n sediments of the water. Of the species discovered, the remains of the \n\n Megatherium and the Mammoth were.the most abundant; and of the former \n\n six heads of femurs were found in the bed of the canal within the distance \n\n of a mile. All the bones were at the same depth, and imbedded in the \n\n same stratum; thus leaving no doubt of their co-existence at a period suc- \n\n ceeding the elevation from the ocean of the newer pliocene, but antece- \n\n dent to the formation of the older recent alluvium of this coast. \n\n\n\nThe co-existence of the Megatherium with the Mastodon, Mammoth, \n\n Hippopotamus, Horse, Ox, and Hog, has here, it is believed, been for the \n\n first time established; and forms, with the discovery on this continent, of \n\n a well defined fossil species of Sus, two interesting facts in Geology. \n\n\n\nThe identity of most of the fossil shells which were found below the \n\n bones of the mammalia with the existing species on this coast, proves \n\n that the temperature of the ocean, long prior to the existence of the Me- \n\n gatherium, Mammoth, and Hippopotamus, was such as is congenial to the \n\n present mollusca. Another inference which may be^drawn is, that the \n\n surface of the country has undergone no sudden or violent change since \n\n these gigantic animals occupied its forests and morasses; but that such as \n\n have occurred have been slow and gradual. \n\n\n\n* The following species occur most abundantly: \n\n\n\nVenus mercenaria, Pyrula caurica, Cardium ventricosum, Artemis con- \n\n centrica, Area pexata, Area ponderosa, Lucina divaricata, Modiola late- \n\n ralis, Tellina alternata, Mactra lateralis ?

' \n\n\n\nProf. Johnson mentioned that he had made trials to'determine the vola- \n\n tile and earthy ingredients of the so-called natural coke from Virginia, of \n\n which samples were exhibited at a preceding meeting of the Academy. \n\n This substance presents in its exterior appearance a strong contrast with \n\n all known varieties of either anthracite or bituminous coal. It is wholly \n\n wanting in lustre. It has lost, if it ever possessed, all continuous slines or \n\n cleats, and even the surfaces of deposition appear to be in a great degree \n\n obliterated. Its texture is porous. It is in very many, if not in all speci- \n\n mens, strongly charged with iron pyrites, which, by exposure to the air, \n\n efflorescing into sulphate of iron, gives the appearance of friability to the \n\n material, and by this means distinguishing it clearly from anthracite. \n\n\n\nTwo samples of this combustible were tried for the purpose of ascer- \n\n taining the amount of earthy matter, volatile matter, and fixed carbon. \n\n\n\nThe first gave of \n\n\n\nper cent. \n\n\n\nVolatile matter, 11 16 \n\n\n\nCarbon, 77.86 \n\n\n\nEarthy matter, 10.98 \n\n\n\n100. \n\n\n\nThe second, which appeared to be rather more highly charged with py- \n\n rites than the other, gave, by the mean of four separate incinerations, of \n\n\n\n100. \n\n\n\nThe distillation of this fuel by the immediate application of a red heat, \n\n produces a gas which burns with a steady clear flame, of a yellowish white \n\n color, accompanied by a little smoke, which, however, nearly or quite dis- \n\n appears when the access of air is free and abundant. \n\n\n\nThe distillation produces no enlargement of volume or adhesiveness of \n\n the particles of carbonaceous matter, as in certain serai- bituminous or \n\n \" transition\" coals, such as that found on Stony Creek, iu Dauphin county, \n\n Pennsylvania. \n\n\n\nIu regard to the applicability of the term \" natural coke\" to this sub- \n\n stance, Prof. J. remarked, that understanding this term as indicating a \n\n change of texture from that of the bituminous coal of the same district, a \n\n partial discharge of the volatile ingredients of the same coal, and as a \n\n\n\n32 \n\n\n\n",

"December, 1842.] 225 \n\n\n\nbusiness by special resolution\". \n\n\n\nBy special permission,- the Committee, consisting of Dr. \n\n Godclard, Mr. Taylor, and Prof. Eogers, to whom was \n\n referred a paper by Peter A. Browne, Esq., on the subject \n\n of the supposed human foot prints found near St. Louis, in \n\n the Carboniferous Limestone, made a Eeport as follows : \n\n\n\nThat they do not consider that the ingenious arguments \n\n of the author can tend in the least to invalidate the reason- \n\n ings of Dr. Owen in favor of the artificial nature of the \n\n foot marks. The evidence furnished by the paper and \n\n accompanying drawing of Dr. Owen, of which the com- \n\n munication before the Committee is a criticism, appears \n\n sufficient to place this question at rest for ever. \n\n\n\nThat these impressions are not genuine imprints of the \n\n human feet, but rude imitations, is obvious upon a slight \n\n anatomical consideration of them. Both the form and \n\n attitudes of the toes are entirely at variance with nature, \n\n and are such as to suggest that the sculptor exercised but \n\n a slight familiarity with the structure and capacities of \n\n motion of the parts. A mere inspection will satisfy all \n\n anatomists upon this point. \n\n\n\nThe geological proofs against their having been formed \n\n whilst the limestone was yet in a plastic state are no less \n\n decisive, since the facts stated by Dr. Owen go distinctly \n\n to show that the slab containing these foot prints is a por- \n\n tion of the carboniferous limestone formation of the Mis- \n\n sissippi Valley, the Oceanic origin of each layer of which \n\n every geologist is prepared to demonstrate. Formed in \n\n the bed of an extended sea, and buried previous to its \n\n upheaval under an enormous accumulation of other \n\n deposits, it is impossible to conceive how human footsteps \n\n could gain access to the unconsolidated rock, even if the \n\n human race had existence at the time. That the race of \n\n man is of incalculably later origin than the rock containing \n\n\n\n", 
"226 [December, 1842. \n\n\n\nthese representations of feet, is, however, a fact thoroughly \n\n established in geology. \n\n\n\nSetting aside, then, the possibility of referring the origin \n\n of these foot prints to the period of the formation of the \n\n rock, there is quite as little warrant for assigning it to any \n\n later period posterior to the upheaval and denudation of \n\n the stratum, for there are no facts connected with this, or \n\n any other of our ancient secondary rocks, which indicate \n\n that they retained their plastic condition after they were \n\n drained, to so late a date as ihe human epoch. \n\n\n\nGuided by these and other considerations of similar \n\n purport, your Committee express their conviction, that the \n\n arguments detailed in the paper submitted to them do not \n\n at all weaken the published proofs of the artificial nature \n\n of the supposed foot prints. \n\n\n\nOn motion of Dr. Goddard, the communication of Mr. \n\n Browne, referred to in the above report, was ordered to be \n\n placed on file. \n\n\n\nSTATED MEETING, December 20, 1842. \n\n Vice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nDONATIONS TO MUSEUM. \n\n Specimens, in spirits, of Monitor ornatus, of Monitor - \n\n\n\nof Crocodilus , and of Chamasleo gracilis, Hallo- \n\n well, (male) from Western Africa. \n\n\n\nAlso a dried specimen of Tetrodon . from Western \n\n\n\nAfrica ; and a specimen, in spirits, of Coluber coccineus, \n\n from Mobile, Alabama.

Menke, of Pyrmont, Germany, beg leave to \n\n make the following statement, forming the principal portion of their Re- \n\n port, due at this season. \n\n\n\nThe apparent neglect and delay in the arrangement of this collection on \n\n the part of the Committee, may be accounted for by the fact, that at the \n\n period of its presentation, preparations were in progress for the erection of \n\n the new Hall, and that after the removal of the Museum to the latter, a \n\n large portion of the time and attention of the Committee was required, in \n\n common with the other members of the Academy, for the disposal and ar- \n\n rangement of its collections in the other departments. \n\n\n\nDuring this period the plants had not been removed from the boxes in \n\n which they had been originally sent by Dr. Menk<5. On examination they \n\n were found to be very carefully and closely packed, and to have sustained \n\n no injury from dampness, and but comparatively few specimens to have \n\n been destroyed by insects. The whole collection had been arranged after \n\n the Linuean or artificial system ; the plants distributed into fasciculi and \n\n labelled accordingly. About two-thirds were well selected and character- \n\n istic specimens, in good paper, with labels containing the name with the \n\n authority for it, the synonyme, the locality, date of collection, and frequently \n\n the name of a donor. The remainder were enclosed in coarse brown paper, \n\n without order or arrangement, and although in most cases properly labelled ; \n\n in many close comparison and study were necessary, in order to determine \n\n even the generic character. The localities were chiefly Pyrmont, Bruns- \n\n wick, Bremen, Arolsen, Monspelier, and Gottingen. From the celebrated \n\n botanical garden in the vicinity of this latter, very many species had been \n\n derived. Specimens were occasionally met with from France, the West \n\n Indies, Hungary, &c. \n\n\n\nThe greater part of this collection had been made between the years \n\n 1810 and 1815. \n\n\n\nAmong the names of donors were many distinguished in Botanical \n\n Science, as Thunberg, Sprengel, Bernhardi, Prof. Treviranus, Prof. \n\n Mertens, Rasmer Goehnat, Lehtnann, Salzmann, Rohde, Weudland, Meyer, \n\n Shrceder, Ehrtnberg, Schmidt, &c. \n\n\n\nBy a reference to the new catalogue, it will be seen that a large propor- \n\n tion of the genera (and most probably of the species) contained in this \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", 
"December, 1842.] 229 \n\n\n\ncollection were already possessed by the Academy. On this account, \n\n therefore, and as the number of cultivated specimens was large, the Com- \n\n mittee deemed it unadvisable to incorporate it with the Herbarium of the \n\n Academy, but concluded upon keeping it entirely distinct, adopting, how- \n\n ever, a similar plan of arrangement as in the Herbarium of the Academy, \n\n viz., combining, as far as possible, the Linnean or Artificial with the Na- \n\n tural System. \n\n\n\nTo accomplish this duty occupied the time and attention of the Commit- \n\n tee for several months. The best and most characteristic specimens were \n\n selected, transferred to paper of uniform size and color, with the generic \n\n name attached to the left hand upper corner of the sheet; the genera being \n\n arranged in their appropriate natural orders, commencing with those latter \n\n which contained the largest proportion of genera belonging to the first \n\n Linnean class, and' so on proceeding to the last this being the plan of the \n\n Herbarium of the Academy alluded to above. \n\n\n\nAs thus completed, the collection comprises 1298 genera, including up- \n\n wards of 7000 species. Of these, 5623 species are Phoenogamous, includ- \n\n ed in about 130 natural orders; and 1272 species are Cryptogamous. Of \n\n the latter, the Ferns embrace 132 species; Equisetum, LycopodiumJ and \n\n the Marsileaceae, 29 species; Hepaticae 65 species; Musci 309 species; \n\n Algaj 122 species; Lichenes 152 species; and Fungi 445 species. To these \n\n are to be added 18 species of Corallia, and a number of plants to which \n\n neither the generic nor specific name was attached. \n\n\n\nThe whole has been distributed into thirty-6even folio volumes of large \n\n size, occupying an entire case six and a half feet high, four feet wide, and \n\n tweuty-one inches in depth. \n\n\n\nThe duplicates are very numerous, and will answer for exchanges. \n\n\n\nThe new catalogue, alluded to above, has been. found necessary, on ac- \n\n count of there now being two separate collections, the previous catalogue \n\n referring but to one. It is furnished with a double column of reference, so \n\n that a genus contained in both collections can be very readily found. \n\n\n\nA number of donations, some of which are of much value, have been \n\n received by the Academy during the year. These have been already \n\n noticed in the published Proceedings at the time of presentation. \n\n\n\nThe chief donors have been our fellow members A. Browne, Esq., \n\n and Mr. R. C. Taylor; Dr. George Engelmann, of St. Louis, Missouri, \n\n and Prof. Short, of Louisville, Kentucky. \n\n\n\nThe duty of incorporating these donations with the Herbarium has been \n\n necessarily deferred until next year. \n\n\n\nOn behalf of the Committee, \n\n\n\nWm, S.

To his brother and \n\n executor, Mr. Alexander Maclure, is the Society under great obligations, \n\n for the persevering efforts which were made by him to accomplish this \n\n object, and also for the interest which he manifested in the general wel- \n\n fare of our Institution. The Academy has been thereby enabled to liqui- \n\n date several urgent claims, and greatly to reduce the debt incurred in the \n\n purchase of the ground on which the present building is erected. \n\n\n\nIn addition to this, its funds have been considerably augmented during \n\n the last few months by the final and successful settlement of a long pend- \n\n ing suit for a claim of upwards of $5000 against the heirs of an unsettled \n\n estate. This was a mortgage transferred to the Academy many years \n\n since, by the late Wm. Maclure. In consequence of many difficulties and \n\n vexatious delays thrown in the way of settlement of this matter, the Aca- \n\n demy had hitherto been unable to make this fund in any way available. \n\n By a compromise made with the heirs, fourteen per cent, of the \n\n\n\n", 
"23S [January, 1S43. \n\n\n\nwhole amount has heen deducted for their use; the balance, amounting to \n\n $4549, is in Pennsylvania five per cent, stock, to which is to be added \n\n $430 interest, paid in par funds, and 113 in six per cent. Pennsylvania \n\n stock, also as interest; the latter being redeemable by the State in August \n\n next. In accordance with the desire of Mr. Alexander Maclure, the first \n\n mentioned sum will not be appropriated at present by the Academy, but \n\n retained until some improvement in the stock occurs, which, it is hoped, \n\n will be at no distant date. At all events, the Society has the positive \n\n assurance of Mr. Maclure that no loss shall be sustained, and that both \n\n principal and interest shall be eventually realised. \n\n\n\nFor the final adjustment of this affair, the Academy is under great obli- \n\n gations to this gentleman, to the Counsel of the Academy, and to several \n\n other members. \n\n\n\nThe Museum of the Academy has been augmented by large and valuable \n\n additions to all its departments during last year. The details of these \n\n presentations, with the names of the donors, have been already given in \n\n the published Proceedings of the Academy during the year, and need not, \n\n therefore, be repeated here. But a brief mention of the names of those \n\n who have contributed most largely in each department is considered due \n\n to them, and will not be unacceptable to the Society. \n\n\n\nCairo, Egypt, J. Hamilton Couper, Esq., of Georgia, Mr. Joseph Brano, of \n\n Philadelphia, and minor donations by Drs. Chaloner, Watson, Carson and \n\n Blanding, and by Prof. W. B. Rogers, of Virginia. \n\n\n\nIn the Ornithological department the presentations have been large and \n\n valuable, and made chiefly by \n\n\n\nProf. Holbrook, of South Carolina, Mr. Charles Twigg, of New Harmony, \n\n Indiana, Mr. J. W. Rulon, and also by a club of members. Also by Mr. \n\n .1. G. Bell, of New York, by the President of the Society, Mr. Wm. \n\n Hembel, and by Mr. George W. Carpenter, Dr. William Blanding, and \n\n Mrs. William Fnrness, of this city. \n\n\n\nTo the Cabinet of Shells important additions have been made by \n\n Dr. Paul B. Goddard, Dr. Benjamin B. Brown, of St. Louis, Missouri, \n\n Mr. .1. Hamilton Couper, Dr. Wm. Walker, of Nashville, Tennessee, and \n\n Dr. J. C. Jay, of New York. Also by Mrs. Lucy W. Say, Mr. P. H. \n\n Nicklin, Mr. Haldeman, Mr. Phillips, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cassin, &c. \n\n\n\nThe Botanical department has been indebted for well preserved and in- \n\n teresting donations of plants to \n\n\n\nPeter A. Browne, Esq., Mr. Richard C. Taylor, the Rev. J. P. Durbin, \n\n Prof. Short, of Louisville, Kentucky, Dr. George Engleman, of St. Louis, \n\n Missouri, J. Frampton Watson, Esq.; and also to Drs. Carson, Godon, \n\n and others, \n\n\n\nA portion of the Herbarium containing the natural family Composite \n\n has been carefully examined by Dr. Asa Gray, of New York, in whose \n\n hands it had been placed, at his own request, for this purpose, and has \n\n been considerably improved, and some additions made to it by him. \n\n\n\nA very large collection of plants presented in the year 1839, by Dr. \n\n\n\n", 
"January, 1S43.] 239 \n\n\n\nMenke, of Pyrmont, Germany, has been at length examined and arranged \n\n by the Botanical Committee, 'whoso Report states that, as arranged, it con- \n\n tains not less than 7000 species in excellent condition. On account of its \n\n size and value they have decided upon keeping it in a separate case from \n\n those containing the Academy's Herbarium, and to designate it the \" Menke \n\n Collection.\" \n\n\n\nOf Minerals, the donations have been chiefly from the following mem- \n\n bers and others. \n\n\n\nP. A. Browne, J. Randolph Clay, George R. Gliddon, Wm, S. Vaux, \n\n J. A. Clay, Esqs., Dr. Wm. T. Craige, &c. \n\n\n\nIn the Entomological department we have had but a single donation to \n\n record in the past year that made by Mr. Charles Twigg, of New \n\n Harmony, Indiana, of insects from that region. The Secretary, however, \n\n has the satisfaction to state, that it is the determination of several \n\n members to exert themselves during the coming season, personally, and \n\n throuo-h friends in the United States, in making collections of American \n\n Insects for the Academy. He would respectfully suggest that the aid of \n\n Foreign Correspondents be also solicited for this purpose. \n\n\n\nTo the Museum there has also been added a number of fine Quadrupeds, \n\n Reptiles, Fishes, Skeletons of Animals and Crania, by members and cor- \n\n respondents. \n\n\n\nThe donations made by the different contributors mentioned, are upwards \n\n of eighty in number. It would be difficult to form a just estimate of the \n\n number of specimens embraced by them ; it cannot, however, fall short of \n\n from four to five hundred. Taken collectively, they form a mass of great \n\n value to the lover of Natural Science, and for which the Academy has \n\n every reason to return its thanks to those persons who have thus testified \n\n their desire to promote the interests of the Institution. \n\n\n\nThe Library has received an equal share of consideration. Many of \n\n the works presented last year are of great value, and the additions are \n\n equal in number to those of former years. The entire number of volumes, \n\n pamphlets, works published in parts, &c, added to the Library in 1842, \n\n has been one hundred and thirty-two; and of these, according to the report \n\n of the Librarian, sixty-nine are new works. For some of these the Aca- \n\n demy exchanges its own publications with other Institutions and indivi- \n\n duals. A large proportion of them, however, have been voluntary contri- \n\n butions from authors, members, and correspondents. \n\n\n\nA new set of cases, occupying the whole extent of the South Flying \n\n Gallery, has been recently completed, which adds much to the appearance \n\n of the Hall. One-half of these cases has been appropriated to the valuable \n\n collection of crania belonging to Dr. Morton, and the remainder to the ac- \n\n commodation of a very extensive series of volumes containing the debates \n\n and proceedings of the different legislative bodies of France during the \n\n period of the Revolution. Its great size, in fact, (upwards of 1600 volumes,) \n\n has hitherto prevented its introduction into the Hall, lest it should encroach \n\n too much on the space in the Library allotted to works of a strictly scien- \n\n tific character. As a full record of the events of that epoch of history it \n\n is highly valuable, and is believed to be possessed by no other Institution \n\n\n\n", 
"2-40 [January, 1843. \n\n\n\nin this country. There are, besides, duplicates of many of these volumes, \n\n which the Academy could, without doubt, exchange for scientific works, \n\n or dispose of in some other way. \n\n\n\nThe meetings of the Society have been held with great regularity during \n\n the year, at the stated periods, without a single exception, and have been \n\n characterised by ample evidences of zeal and interest in the cause of \n\n science. Many valuable original papers have been presented, most of \n\n which have been published either in the Journal of the Academy, or in \n\n its Proceedings, and have contributed still further to advance the high \n\n character of our Institution. \n\n\n\nThe Second Part of the 8th Volume of the Journal was issued about the \n\n middle of the year, and besides the papers referred to, contains many well \n\n executed and faithful illustrations of the objects which they describe. The \n\n Proceedings have been published at intervals of from one to three months. \n\n This plan of publication was commenced early in the year 1841, and has \n\n been adhered to ever since with advantage to the members and corres- \n\n pondents affording them a medium for acquainting the scientific public \n\n with their discoveries and observations without delay. \n\n\n\nSeveral prominent members have had in view for some time past the \n\n reduction of the annual contribution to one-half its present amount, and \n\n have only been prevented from bringing the subject before the Society, \n\n for its action, from a conviction that its best interests would be consulted \n\n by deferring it until something more definite and certain was known re- \n\n specting the amount of reduction which would be effected in the remaining \n\n debt of the Academy during the present year. An effort will then be \n\n made at the earliest practicable period to accomplish this object, which, it \n\n is believed, is desired by a large majority of the members. \n\n\n\nFrom the statement thus given of the operations of this Society during \n\n the past year, it is hoped that the assertion made at the beginning of this \n\n report, that its present condition is flattering, will not be considered as \n\n having been premature or unfounded. \n\n\n\nWith no other debt remaining, except the one just referred to and that \n\n in the way of reduction at an early period, and to such an extent as, after \n\n its accomplishment, to admit of the Society's appropriating annually a \n\n considerable portion of its income to the scientific purposes of the Insti- \n\n tution with a list of nearly one hundred and fifty contributing and resi- \n\n dent members, and of three hundred and seventy domestic and foreign cor- \n\n respondents, mostly zealous in aiding the Institution, and in promoting the \n\n objects for which it was founded, it is not hazarding too much in express- \n\n ing the belief that by a steady continuance of these efforts, and a prudent \n\n management of its financial concerns, its prosperity must henceforth be \n\n permanent. \n\n\n\nTwenty-five years only have elapsed since this Institution was incor- \n\n porated. It is therefore still in its youth. In that time it has advanced \n\n from comparative unimportance, to a consequence and standing which the \n\n most sanguine of its founders could scarcely have anticipated. To the \n\n industry, talent, zeal and liberality of many of its members, is this to be \n\n\n\n",

A distinguished member of this Society, \n\n who is himself one of its warmest and most active friends, and who has \n\n contributed in no small degree to its advancement, has already done ample \n\n justice to the memory of Mr. Maclure for these acts.* But there still re- \n\n mains with us the obligation, which is of no light character, to use every \n\n suitable endeavor to place this Institution in that elevated position which, \n\n in making it the special object of such munificence, it was the design of \n\n Mr. Maclure it should hold. \n\n\n\nAll which is respectfully submitted, by \n\n\n\nWm.

One of these, under the name \n\n of ' M. excisa,' he proposes to erect into a new genus, under \n\n the name of 'Schizostoma,' on account of the deep slit in \n\n the lip. Having possessed specimens from the same \n\n localities for some time past, embracing, as I believe, seven \n\n or eight species of this proposed genus, I have referred \n\n them to Swainson's genus, 'Melatoma,' founded, as he \n\n states, ' upon a Shell sent him many years ago by his old \n\n friend Professor Eafinesque, and which, he says, has the \n\n general form of Pleurotoma melafusus, with a well \n\n defined sinus or cleft near the top of the outer lip.' I have \n\n mentioned this with a view to call the attention of the \n\n members to it, and to have the question of nomenclature \n\n settled correctly. I have, within two months past, received \n\n one species of this genus from Dr. Mighels, of Portland, \n\n Maine, under the name of 'Apella scissura.' \" \n\n\n\nThe communication was accompanied by a second and \n\n corrected edition of his Catalogue of the Terrestrial and \n\n Fluviatile Shells of Ohio. \n\n\n\nMr. Cassin read a paper intended for publication, and \n\n entitled \"A Description of several new and rare Birds from \n\n the Kocky Mountains and California, by William Gambel:\" \n\n\n\n",

He pointed out, in particular, the perfect identity in \n\n the form of the Russian anticlinal flexures and those of the \n\n Appalachian chain of the 'United States; the resemblance con- \n\n sisting in the want of a symmetrical curvature in the arches, and \n\n an inequality in the steepness of the dips on the opposite sides \n\n of the axes. \n\n\n\nAlluding to the structural laws first developed by his brother \n\n and himself from a study of the Appalachian chain, and conceived \n\n by them to characterize regions of anticlinal axes generally, he \n\n proceeded to show that upon the theory of the origin of these \n\n flexures, the same style of curvature should be met with in all \n\n countries, as a necessary consequence of the universality of those \n\n laws. The exhibition, therefore, of an anticlinal arch, having \n\n the normal form, in the banks of the Pulkowka in Russia, goes \n\n to conGrm the generalizations of these authors. Instances of the \n\n same characteristic feature are to met with abundantly, however, \n\n in the sections which geologists present of the stratification in \n\n many other districts of Europe. \n\n\n\n",

It has much the habit of E. purpurea, but is more fami- \n\n liar. In Santa Fe, in New Mexico, it builds its nest under the portals \n\n of the houses in the public square, and alights familiarly about the \n\n doors ; in July they had fledged young. They also appeared here to \n\n have a partiality for meat, which is frequently hung up in the sheds, \n\n eating it greedily whenever they had an opportunity. In California, \n\n also, I have observed them examining the sheds and portals, perhaps \n\n for places suitable for building their nests. \n\n\n\nDEFERRED BUSINESS. \n\n\n\nThe Society then proceeded to the consideration of two \n\n Eesolutions offered at previous meetings, to alter Article I., \n\n Chapter III., of the By-Laws, reducing the amount of the \n\n\n\n",

They were all standing \n\n erect, and nearly on the same general level. Dr. 0. had him- \n\n self excavated three ; the largest of these was about three \n\n\n\n", 
"May, 1843.] 271 \n\n\n\nfeet in height and sixteen inches in diameter. All of them \n\n were provided with well preserved roots, ramifying in the \n\n substance of the surrounding argillaceous deposite. \n\n\n\nAbout one foot above the fossil trees is a layer of sand- \n\n stone, and a partially disintegrated seam of coal a few inches \n\n thick; fifteen feet below, and beneath the water in Big \n\n Creek, is a seam of coal supposed to be from three to four \n\n feet thick. Nodules of argillaceous iron ore are dissemi- \n\n nated in the surrounding slaty clay. No appearance of a \n\n dirt bed was discovered. \n\n\n\nThe horizontal section of these trees exhibits no medullary \n\n rays nor annual growths ; but the structure of the bark is \n\n visible on the external part of most of the specimens, and \n\n part of it is generally converted into a dark carbonaceous \n\n substance. The scars, left from the falling off of the leaf- \n\n stalks, though small, are distinctly visible in some of the \n\n smaller specimens. From the diameter of these scars being \n\n longer horizontally than vertically, and the absence of pa- \n\n rallel flutings, these monocotyledonous fossil trees are consi- \n\n dered as belonging to the family of palms. \n\n\n\nWith the exception of the fossil palm trees, found at Dixon \n\n fold, on the Bury and Bolton Railroad, in England, this ap- \n\n pears to be the only authentic instance of the occurrence of \n\n well preserved specimens of fossil palm trees in strata of the \n\n arboniferous epoch. \n\n\n\n",

They made their appearance \n\n there three or four weeks since, and were chiefly to be found in the \n\n tract of country lying between the two places mentioned, not ex- \n\n ceeding fifty miles in extent. In one apple orchard the trees were \n\n literally loaded with them ; some trees Dr. M. supposed to contain \n\n not less than two thousand. The foliage or other vegetation, so far \n\n as his observatien extended, had as yet sustained no perceptible \n\n injury from them ; and naturalists were still undecided with re- \n\n\n\n", 
"June, 1843.] 277 \n\n\n\ngard to the kind or source of sustenance preferred by the insect \n\n during the time it remains above the surface. \n\n\n\nDr. Morton referred to the minutes of a former year, 1834, \n\n when this insect had appeared in the city and its vicinity, for a re- \n\n cord of interesting information on the subject, which, at his request, \n\n was read by the Secretary. \n\n\n\n[The following extracts from the minutes alluded to have not \n\n been published at any previous period, and are presented at this \n\n time, chiefly with the view of calling the attention of members and \n\n others to the subject, and of inducing farther investigation. \n\n\n\nAt the meeting of June 3d, 1834, Dr. Harlan stated that on the \n\n 25th of May last he had observed the Cicada septemdecim in such \n\n large numbers as to blacken a field of wheat in the vicinity of the \n\n city : they were also very numerous in some of the public squares- \n\n It was his belief that the insect increased somewhat in size while \n\n it remained ; and also, that nothing was known respecting its food. \n\n Upon dissection, mere rudiments of the organs of digestion were \n\n found. \n\n\n\nMr. Rogers, on the contrary, stated that in 1817, the trees in \n\n the neighborhood of Baltimore had been stripped of their leaves by \n\n this insect. He also expressed some doubt as to their common \n\n origin, from the fact of their periodical return not being necessarily \n\n in the same year in different parts of the country, and that this was \n\n probably owing to geological causes. \n\n\n\nDr. Keagy had seen them in 1815 in the Valley of the Missis- \n\n sippi ; in 1817 near Baltimore, and in 1832 in Westmoreland \n\n county, Pennsylvania ; Dr. R. Coates in 1818, in Burlington \n\n county, New Jersey; Mr. Gibbons in 1825, near Moorestown, \n\n New Jersey, and in 1827 in the eastern part of Virginia ; Mr. \n\n Johnson in 1831, near Rochester, New York; and Dr. Morton in \n\n 1817, in Westchester county, New York. \n\n\n\nDr. Coates had seen a tree in Germantown nearly destroyed, in \n\n 1817, by the deposition of the ova of the insect. \n\n Dr. Pickering stated that this Cicada had not yet been met with \n\n in the eastern part of New England, but that a rare species of \n\n Cicada had been found nearly resembling the C. septemdecim, and \n\n which might be easily confounded with it; the latter differed, how- \n\n ever, in the abdomen being all black: in the former, the rings of \n\n\n\n", 
"278 [June, 1843. \n\n\n\nthe abdomen have each a red border; they were usually found in \n\n rocky soil. \n\n\n\nAt the subsequent meeting, Mr. Gibbons read an extract of a \n\n letter from his brother on the subject of the Cicada septemdecim, in \n\n which the writer stated that he had seen them feeding on the sweet \n\n gum, by pushing the proboscis into the bark ; when this organ was \n\n withdrawn a drop of fluid appeared at the aperture, which served \n\n for food to some ants. \n\n\n\nDr. Mutter exhibited a dissection of the singing apparatus of the \n\n Cicada septemdecim, consisting of the diaphragm and an air cell \n\n and sounding board on each side, and a pair of muscles. The \n\n whole is distinct from the abdominal cavity. The proboscis was \n\n hollow, and intestines convoluted, without perceptible oesophagus or \n\n stomach. \n\n\n\nMr. Lukens mentioned that with Mr. T. B. Peale he had seen \n\n the Cicada septemdecim feeding, by pushing the proboscis into the \n\n bark of trees, particularly young beech trees. \n\n\n\nAt the meeting on the 1st July, Dr. McEuen (then Eecording \n\n Secretary) stated that the C. septemdecim had disappeared from \n\n some places in the vicinity of the city since the occurrence of a \n\n heavy rain ; he also exhibited the young branches of trees in which \n\n the ova of the insect had been deposited in punctures in longitu- \n\n dinal lines, many in one perforation. The young branches had \n\n been thereby for the most part destroyed. \n\n\n\nDr. Buschenberger, at the meeting of July 8th, observed that in \n\n travelling from Baltimore to Frederick, Maryland, he had found \n\n the C septemdecim abundant at the two places mentioned, whilst \n\n none were seen in Montgomery county, between Baltimore and \n\n Washington.] \n\n\n\nAfter the above extracts had been read, Prof. Bogers made some \n\n remarks on the subject, chiefly confirmatory of the opinion ex- \n\n pressed by him in 1834, of the periodical return of the insect being \n\n influenced by geological causes. \n\n\n\nDr. Goddard referred to the well known fact of the C. septem- \n\n decim being occasionally found in a living state at a great distance \n\n below the surface. When so discovered, its head is usually down- \n\n ward. According to the published statements of a recent observer, \n\n Mr. Ehrenberg, of Berlin, minute infusoria may be found at a great \n\n\n\n", 
"June, 1843.] 279 \n\n\n\ndepth in the earth, and authorizing the conjecture that Dr. G-. \n\n offered, that these infusoria afforded sustenance to the insect during \n\n its long absence. He expressed his belief that no satisfactory rea- \n\n son had as yet been given for its reappearance at regular periods. \n\n\n\nAs another fact, not probably known to the members generally, \n\n he mentioned that the yolk of eggs brought from the district of \n\n New Jersey at present visited by the insect, had lost, in a great \n\n measure, their yellow color. This had been observed in former \n\n years, and was supposed by the farmers to be caused by the fowls \n\n feeding on the insect. \n\n\n\nMr. Gliddon stated that in Lycoming county, in this State, \n\n whence he had recently returned, the insect had been very nume. \n\n rous, but at the time of his visit had nearly disappeared. The sto. \n\n machs of some trout which he had caught there were found to be \n\n gorged with it. \n\n\n\nMr. Cassin had been informed that the C. septemclecim was now \n\n very abundant in other counties of the State, particularly near \n\n Mauch Chunk. He also stated that the irregularity in the time of \n\n the appearance of the insect had been supposed to be owing to the \n\n overlapping of adjoining districts ; as an example of which Loudon \n\n <;ounty, Virginia, was mentioned, where it appears at intervals of \n\n eight and nine years alternately. Although, as regards this lo- \n\n cality, and perhaps some others, this hypothesis may be correct, it \n\n will not apply to all cases. In 1834, the C. septemdecim appeared \n\n in the neighborhood of Philadelphia and in the adjoining counties, \n\n and again in small quantities in Chester county, in 1836. \n\n\n\nMr. Cassin expressed the opinion that there are two varieties, of \n\n the C. septemdecin, the larger and smaller, both of which appeared \n\n in this vicinity in 1834 ; they differ in size, and also in their note. \n\n The larger is the one commonly known as the seventeen year \n\n locust. \n\n\n\nDr. Goddard then called the attention of the members to a plan \n\n which he had recently adopted for removing a disease, common \n\n and very fatal to newly fledged chicks, and familiarly known as \n\n \" the gapes,\" and which he considered of importance to be known \n\n by agriculturalists. \n\n\n\nUpon opening ihe trachea of a chick laboring under the disease, \n\n he discovered there a parasitic worm, which obstructed respiration, \n\n\n\n", 
"280 [June, 1843. \n\n\n\nand occasioned inflammation of the part. By injecting into the \n\n trachea a small quantity of a mixture of equal parts of spirit of tur- \n\n pentine and olive oil, he succeeded in destroying the worm, and \n\n removing all the symptoms, and in every instance saving the life \n\n of the chick. \n\n\n\nMEETING FOR BUSINESS. \n\n June 27, 1843. \n\n\n\nVice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nSeveral Reports having been received, and private busi- \n\n ness transacted, the Society proceeded to ballot for Mem- \n\n bers and Correspondents.

"July, 1S43, 283 \n\n\n\nMEETING FOR BUSINESS, July 25, 1843. \n\n\n\nVice President Morton in the Chair. \n\n\n\nThe Report of the Corresponding Secretary was read and \n\n adopted. \n\n\n\nThe Committee to whom was referred the following paper, \n\n reported in favor of its publication in the Proceedings of the \n\n Academy. \n\n\n\nDescriptions of two Species, supposed to be new, of the Genus Tyrannula \n\n Swainson, found in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. By William M. \n\n & Spencer F. Baird, of Carlisle, Pa. \n\n\n\nFor the first of the species hereafter described, we propose the name of \n\n Tyrannula flaviventris, the bright yellow colour of the lower parts constitut- \n\n ing a striking feature. The other we have named Tyrannula minima, it \n\n being the least of all our North American Tyrannulse. \n\n\n\nThe similarity in colour and size between a number of our small tyrant \n\n fly-catchers being very great, we have deemed it best to send with the \n\n specimens of the two described, skins of T. acadica, and S. Traillii, spe- \n\n cies which most nearly resemble them. By a comparison of the four, the \n\n distinctive features of each will at once be perceived. \n\n\n\nTyrannula flaviventris, (nob.) \n\n Specific Characters. Above deep greenish olive, beneath bright sulphur \n\n yellow, sides and fore part of breast olivaceous. Tail emarginate. Third \n\n and fourth primaries longest. Bill brownish yellow beneath. \n\n\n\nDescription of a Male. \n\n\n\nForm, $rc. Body rather stout. Bill broad and the sides convex. Tarsus \n\n longer than the middle toe. Wings rounded ; third primary longest, fourth \n\n slightly shorter, second one line shorter than third, and two lines longer \n\n than fifth, first shorter than fifth, but longer than sixth. Tail emarginate \n\n and slightly rounded. \n\n\n\nColour. Bill above dark blackish brown, beneath light yellowish brown: \n\n Feet brownish black. Plumage of the upper parts deep greenish olive, \n\n crown of the head rather darker, the feathers having their centres dark \n\n brown. A narrow ring round the eye pale yellow. Lower tail coverts, \n\n abdomen, and linings of the wings, bright sulphur yellow, deepest on the \n\n\n\n", 
"2S4 [July, 184 3 \n\n\n\nabdomen. Sides of the body, forepart of the breast, and sides of the neck, \n\n olive, lighter than the back, and inclining to yellowish on the throat. Pri- \n\n maries and tail feathers dark brown, the former bordered with grayish, \n\n and the latter with olive like the back. The lower row of lesser wing co- \n\n verts and the secondary coverts darker, tipped with pale yellow, that co- \n\n lour forming two bands across the wing. Secondaries darker than the \n\n primaries, and edged with pale yellow. \n\n\n\nLength 5 inches 4 lines ; extent 8 inches 8 lines ; folded wing 2 inches \n\n 9 lines. \n\n\n\nThe sexes are similar in colour, but the female is generally rather \n\n smaller. \n\n\n\nObservations. This strongly marked species will at once be distinguished \n\n from every other by the deep yellow of its under parts. It resembles \n\n T. acadica of Gmelin (querula of Wilson) somewhat in form, but acadica \n\n by comparison will be found to be a larger bird, lighter olive above, and \n\n very pale yellow beneath. The tail of acadica is even or slightly rounded, \n\n in this species emarginate. \n\n\n\nWe have no specimen of T. pusilla, of Swainson, but upon comparison \n\n with the description in Swainson and Richardson's Zoology of North \n\n America, (so favourably known for accuracy,) it appears to differ in the \n\n colour of the upper parts, pusilla being \" intermediate between hair brown \n\n and oil green ;\" our species is of a decided olive green ; the front of pusilla \n\n is \"hoary;\" in our species dark brownish olive; the bands on the wing- \n\n grayish white; in our species pale yellow; \"throat and breast\" of T. pu- \n\n silla \" pale ash gray;\" in this species the throat is yellow, and the breast \n\n olive tinged with yellow. \n\n\n\nThis species was first observed in the spring of 1840, near Carlisle, \n\n Pennsylvania. During every succeeding spring since, it has been seen in \n\n greater or less numbers, and several specimens procured each year. Its \n\n habits are much like those of the other species of this genus; it frequents \n\n low thickets near small streams, is seldom found in large woods like T. \n\n acadica, or T. virens, and is a very unsuspicious bird, allowing persons \n\n to approach within a short distance, [t probably goes further north than \n\n Pennsylvania to breed, having never been observed after the latter part of \n\n May or beginning of June. \n\n\n\nTyrannula minima, (nob. ) \n\n Specific characters. Above dark grayish olive, breast light ash gray, ab- \n\n domen and lower tail coverts yellowish white. Tail emarginate. Second \n\n and third primaries longest, first longer than sixth. Bill horn colour be- \n\n neath. \n\n\n\nDescription of a Male. \n\n Form, &c. Body rather slender. Bill smaller than the other species of \n\n the genus. Tarsus slightly longer than the middle toe. Second primary \n\n\n\n", 
"July, 1S43. 1 285 \n\n\n\nlongest, third nearly equal, and rather longer than fourth, fifth one line \n\n shorter than fourth, first intermediate between fifth and sixth. Tail emar- \n\n ginate and slightly rounded. \n\n\n\nColour, Bill dark blackish brown above, pale horn color beneath. Feet \n\n black. Plumage of the upper parts dark grayish olive, crown somewhat \n\n darker, rump lighter and inclining to grayish. A narrow ring round the \n\n eye grayish white. Fore part of breast, sides, and sides of the neck light \n\n ash grey, middle of throat white, rest of the lower parts very pale yellow \n\n or yellowish white. Primaries and tail feathers wood brown, the former \n\n narrowly, and the latter broadly edged with olive. Lower row of lesser \n\n wing coverts and the secondary coverts darker, tipped with dirty white, \n\n that colour forming two bands across the wings. Secondaries also dark, \n\n like the greater wing coverts, and broadly edged with yellowish white. \n\n\n\nLength 5 inches, 2 lines. Extent 8 inches, 3 lines. Folded wing 2| \n\n inches. \n\n\n\nNo perceptible difference as to colour or size between the sexes. \n\n\n\nObservations. This species will be recognized by its size, its slender \n\n form making it the smallest of our North American Tyrannulaa. In colour \n\n it most resembles T. Traillii, of Aud., but it is a much smaller bird, being \n\n nearly three-fourths of an inch shorter. T. Traillii has the breast and \n\n sides of the neck olivaceous ; in this species light ash gray; the tail also of \n\n T. Traillii is even. \n\n\n\nIt differs from T. pusilla (comparing with the description of Swainson \n\n and Richardson as before) in having the wings more pointed, the second \n\n and third primaries being longest, and the firstlonger than the sixth; while in \n\n pusilla the third and fourth are longest, and the first shorter than the sixth. \n\n The upper tail coverts of pusilla are uniform in colour with the back ; in \n\n our species lighter : pusilla has the front \" hoary;\" in this species dark. \n\n The lower parts of pusilla are pale sulphur yellow, \"approaching to siskin- \n\n green ;\" in our species yellowish white : the under mandible of pusilla is \n\n yellowish brown; of this species horn colour. From the figure in the \n\n Fauna Boreali-Americana, pusilla appears to be a stouter bird, much \n\n deeper in colour beneath and having a broader bill. Its smaller size, and \n\n darker colour above, will distinguish it from T. acadica (being two-thirds \n\n of an inch shorter.) which species has also longer and more pointed wings, \n\n a much larger bill which is light brown beneath, and an even tail. \n\n\n\nThis species was first observed and procured in May, 1839, near Car- \n\n lisle, Pennsylvania. Since then numbers have been observed and shot on \n\n every succeeding spring. Like the preceding, (T. flaviventris,) this bird \n\n does not frequent deep forests, but is found among the scattering trees \n\n which border our streams. It is rather shyer than T. flaviventris, and \n\n and does not, like that species, seek dense thickets. It also, most proba- \n\n bly, goes further north to breed, as after the last of May it is no longer to \n\n be seen. It visits us from the south in the latter part of April, generally \n\n making its appearance about a week before T. flaviventris. \n\n\n\n",

"328 [December, 1843. \n\n\n\nObservations. \n\n\n\nIn 328 species of organic remains already described, independent of minute \n\n and uncertain forms, 43 have been found in a recent state; and when to these \n\n are added numerous very small shells which are found in every careful examina- \n\n tion of marl from the various localities, the percentage of recent species may be \n\n pretty accurately estimated at about 11 or 12 per cent. This result I have ob- \n\n tained by a careful exploration of the fossilliferous beds, and two visits to the \n\n shores of Florida and Alabama to procure recent forms for comparison with \n\n those of the Miocene strata. The last trip furnished three recent shells before \n\n known only in the fossil state. \n\n\n\nSeveral species described in the preceding pages I obtained during a recent \n\n excursion to Petersburg, Virginia, at the kind invitation of Mr. Tuomey. In \n\n the course of a few hours examination of the marl in the vicinity in three or \n\n four days, I collected about 100 distinct species. This locality is peculiarly \n\n interesting, being the western limit of the Miocene, having a considerable eleva- \n\n tion above tide, and based on granite, it is the spot in which to search for the \n\n estuary and fresh water shells of the Miocene period. Mr. Tuomey has already \n\n found an extinct Cyrena, and a univalve not very unlike* Paiundina sub- \n\n purpurea, (Say,) whilst I discovered a species of Cerithium, identical with a \n\n shell which I found last spring inhabiting oyster beds in the Manitee river, \n\n near its junction with Tampa Bay. It is about the size and nearly resembles \n\n C. trilineatum, figured in Kiener's work. \n\n\n\nThe elevation of the Petersburg Miocene is considerably more than 100 feet \n\n above tide, and as the rise decreases towards the sea, it is probable that the pri- \n\n mary rocks continued to be uplifted even after the era of the Miocene ; indeed \n\n how can we otherwise account for the elevation of fossilliferous beds, even of \n\n those of the Post-Pliocene period ? \n\n\n\nIt is an interesting fact that the Miocene estuaries were inhabited by two \n\n species of bivalves, now extinct, of the same two genera which still occur in simi- \n\n lar situations in Florida and Alabama, that is at the confluence of rivers and bays, \n\n where the water is nearly fresh. These genera are Gnathodon and Cyrena, \n\n both of the family Ctrenad.tj. The extinct Gnathodon has a considerable \n\n resemblance to the recent species, but the Cyrena is widely different from the \n\n living shell. These fossils are frequently water-worn, always with disunited \n\n valves, and appear to have been transported. Occasionally a specimen occurs \n\n not in the least abraded, a circumstance which indicates the vicinity of the \n\n Petersburg deposits to the mouth of a river. The strata occur in a meadow, \n\n and consist of blue marl of a sandy texture, often intermixed with small gravel, \n\n and of ferruginous sand, full of shells ; there is here also a proportion of gravel, \n\n of rounded quartz, occasionally of large size. Water-worn fragments of \n\n bivalves are abundantly intermingled with entire shells, and many species occur \n\n with connected valves. This is particularly the case with the burrowing shells, \n\n as Panopoea, but also, though less frequently, with the large Venus tridacnoides, \n\n Crassatella undulata, Astahte concentrica, Cytherea albaria, two species \n\n of Chama, and even two species of Ostrea are not uncommon ; but there is \n\n nothing like an oyster bed in these strata which might indicate shoal water.

C. at the depth of 8 fathoms. \n\n\n\n\"With the many interesting bivalves of Petersburg I found a valve of the \n\n beautiful \n\n\n\nPholadomya abrupta. \n\n\n\nwhich Deshayes has referred to Panopoea. I carefully removed the marl from \n\n the hinge, in order to ascertain if there was an erect curved tooth as in Pan- \n\n opcea, but the hinge proved to be destitute of any kind of tooth or process, and \n\n closely resembles that of the recent Pholadomya. Two characters, therefore, \n\n remove this shell from the genus Panopcea,- the pearliness of the substance and \n\n the absence of a cardinal tooth. A true panopoea is never pearly, any more \n\n than a Unio is ever otherwise. \n\n\n\nObservations on the Lead Bearing Limestone of Wisconsin, and descriptions \n\n of a new genus of Trilobites and fifteen new Silurian fossils. \n\n\n\nBy T. A. Conrad. \n\n\n\nAs the galeniferous limestone of Wisconsin and Galena has attracted the \n\n attention of our most distinguished Geologists, who have endeavored to assign \n\n its relative position in the scale of formations, I hope it may not be deemed pre- \n\n sumptuous if I endeavor to assist in settling a question of so much importance. \n\n The difficulty has hitherto arisen from the scarcity and obscurity of characteris- \n\n tic fossils, which is now in a great measure removed. Some years since I had \n\n the pleasure of examining a series of organic remains collected by Richard C. \n\n Taylor, Esq. at the lead mines in Wisconsin, and then distinctly recognized the \n\n species which belong to the Trenton limestone of New York, a rock which, in \n\n my first report on the Geology of New York, I showed to be an independant \n\n formation, and entirely distinct from any above or below it. Since then I have \n\n proved its occurrence at Cincinnati, in Ohio, and at Carlisle and Bedford \n\n Springs, Pennsylvania. In these remote localities the fossils are generally the \n\n same species, and the group of a unity which admits not of doubt or ambiguity. \n\n\n\nThe specimens found by Mr. R. C.Taylor are chiefly from the limestone below \n\n the lead, and consist of Bellerofhron bilobatus, (Sowerby.) \n\n\n\nThere are also specimens of fossiliferous limestone from Cassville, Wisconsin, \n\n of the same age, containing a Trenton limestone species of Orthis, like C. callac- \n\n tis, a Naculite, occurring also near Middleville, N. Y., Belleuofhron bilo. \n\n batus, a Strophomena like Orthis alternata, Sowerby, a common shell in the \n\n New York Trenton limestone, and an Orthis resembling O. tcstudinaria, still \n\n more abundant in the same rock. \n\n\n\nIn the same collection are carboniferous fossils, in limestone and in chert, from \n\n St. Genevieve, Missouri. The species consist of a large Bellerophron, \n\n three species of Productus and one of Atrypa, all of which are found only in \n\n the carboniferous or mountain limestone. \n\n\n\nI am indebted to the liberality of Mr. Stephen Taylor, who has recently re- \n\n turned to this city from Mineral Point, Wisconsin Territory, for an opportunity \n\n\n\n", 
"330 [December, 1843. \n\n\n\nto investigate some organic remains of more than ordinary interest, which that \n\n gentleman procured at the lead mines. Accompanying these are specimens of \n\n fossiliferous limestone, shells, and fragments of Trilobites in beautiful relief \n\n upon the surface, and so familiar and characteristic, that at the first glance I \n\n recognized the Trenton limestone of New York. The most prominent of these \n\n fossils consist of the trilobites, Ceratjrcs pleurexanthemus,Is<yvEivs gigas, and \n\n\n\nIll23nus , and of the shells, Strophomen a sericea, Phragmoljtes \n\n\n\ncompressus, and Bellerophron bilobatus. With these are a large Cytherina, \n\n known also to occur in the Trenton limestone of New York: the Terebra- \n\n tula (Atrypa) Schlottheimii of Von Buch, and some beautiful new species of \n\n bivalves. The limestone is very compact, replete with shells and favosites, of \n\n a light color, inclining to drab, and it immediately underlies the rock in which \n\n the galena occurs, as Mr. Taylor informs me. Many of the fossils are loose \n\n and exceedingly well preserved, having apparently come from a soft limestone \n\n shale. \n\n\n\nIn examining, a few years since, some specimens of limestone brought from \n\n Galena, by the late lamented Nicollet, and which he informed me, was ihe rock \n\n immediately below the lead-bearing strata, I recognized the group of fossils \n\n which characterize the Trenton limestone, but Mr. Nicollet was unable to pro- \n\n cure any organic remains from the overlying rock, which might furnish a clue \n\n to its geological age. Mr. Taylor has fortunately obtained this desirable object, \n\n in Wisconsin, having discovered not only well preserved fossils, in the lead-bear- \n\n ing formation, but even shells and remains of crinoidea replaced by the \n\n sulphuret of lead. There is particularly the cast of a large Turritella com- \n\n posed entirely of this mineral, and a specimen of Pleurotomaria anguluta, \n\n which is a limestone cast, with the upper part of the spire of galena, and from \n\n fragments yet remaining between the caste and matrix, it is evident that the \n\n shell itself had been replaced by the sulphuret of lead. These two shells are \n\n not uncommon in the Trenton limestone of Lewis county, New York. The \n\n Turritella I have never known to occur in any other formation but the Phuro- \n\n tomaria I found also in the Salmon river, or Pulaski shale, near Rome, Oneida \n\n county. Mr. Taylor has likewise a crinoidal column, almost wholly replaced \n\n by galena: it has distant very prominent rings or ridges, and is a species which \n\n has been observed in the Trenton limestone of New York. \n\n\n\nFrom the evidence it is clear that the limestone of Galena, Illinois, and of \n\n Mineral Point, Wisconsin, in which the lead occurs, is certainly not of more \n\n recent date than the Pulaski and Lorraine shales of New York, and the cara- \n\n doc sandstone of Great Britain : but I believe it will prove to be an upper mem- \n\n ber of the Trenton limestone formation. \n\n\n\nMr. Taylor has also a specimen of Trenton limestone, precisely similar to \n\n that of Galena and Mineral Point, which was found in Wisconsin, 40 miles \n\n N. E. of Galena. \n\n\n\nThere is a specimen of the sulphuret of lead, among the cubes of which is \n\n imbedded a single valve of Strophomena, very thin and silicified. \n\n\n\nMr. Taylor brought the Pentamerus oblongus, Catexipora escharoides, \n\n and C. labyrinthica, which were found together on one of the hillocks or \n\n mounds,\" as they are termed in Wisconsin. These two fossils, when associ- \n\n\n\n",

The contribu- \n\n tions to its Library and Collections have equalled those of former years ; \n\n its usefulness has been thereby increased, and the field for investigation \n\n and the study of the Natural Sciences enlarged. In all the departments \n\n this has been the case, as the following summary will show : \n\n\n\nIn Geology and Mineralogy there have been received twenty-three do- \n\n nations from the following: Drs. Burrough ; Morton; Elwyn ; \n\n Blanding; Lafon ; Goheen, of Liberia,\"Africa; D. D. Owen, of \n\n New Harmony, Indiana; Fussell, of Indiana; B. B. Brown, of \n\n St. Louis; Professors Forchey, of Natchez, and H. D. Rogers; and \n\n from Messrs. French and Demestre, of New Orleans; Codwise, \n\n of St. Croix; J. Cassin ; S. B. Ashmead ; VV. S.

"336 [December, 1843. \n\n\n\nIn Helminthology, one donation, by Mr. William G. Burke. \n\n\n\nIn Conehology, seven donations, by Messrs. J. G. Anthony,*of Cin- \n\n cinnati ; C. M. Wheatley, of New York ; Dr. J. C. Jay, of do. ; \n\n Professor Forchey ; Mr. Thomas Beasley, of New Jersey ; and \n\n Messrs. Ashmead and Cassin. \n\n\n\nIn Osteology, two donations, by the Messrs. Baird, of Carlisle, and \n\n Dr. Goheen. \n\n\n\nIn Botany, five donations, by Messrs. J. N. Nicollet ; P. A. Browne; \n\n Mr. Codwise, of St. Croix; Mrs. Wm. S. Biddle, of Phila- \n\n delphia, and Dr. Goheen. \n\n\n\nThe most interesting- and valuable accession to the Museum during the \n\n\n\nit \n\n\n\nyear has been that of an articulated skeleton of an adult male Chimpan- \n\n zee, Troglodytes niger, Geoff., received from Dr. S. M. E. Goheen, of \n\n Liberia, Africa, and one of the Correspondents of this Institution. The \n\n skeleton is deficient only in the sternum, the two patellae, and some of the \n\n smaller phalanges of the feet and hands. For these, similar bones of a \n\n young human subject have been substituted, so that the specimen appears \n\n perfect. \n\n\n\nI have the satisfaction to state that during the last season the interest in \n\n the Entomological department has been revived, and that to several \n\n sources, but especially to our fellow members, the Messrs. Ashmead, Mr. \n\n Kilvington and Dr. Watson, is the Academy indebted for a considerable \n\n accession of native insects. For a long period, little or no effort has been \n\n made in this department. The valuable collection presented to the Aca- \n\n demy by the late Mr. Say has been entirely lost or destroyed, and the \n\n beautifully arranged and costly cabinet of Drs. McMurtrie and Pickering \n\n has very nearly shared the same fate. Of other minor donations the bare \n\n fragments can be found. Various plans have been resorted to, in the hope \n\n of preventing these losses, but hitherto without success. Under such dis- \n\n couragements, it is not surprising that this department should have been \n\n neglected of late. To the donations mentioned, have been added the best \n\n and most perfect specimens selected from the collection of Drs. McMurtrie \n\n and Pickering, and all have been carefully disinfected by exposing them to a \n\n high temperature for many hours. A new method for preserving them \n\n from future injury has been adopted, which it is believed will be effectual. \n\n\n\nThe collection of Reptilia, during the last summer has been removed from \n\n the Hair to the room on the ground floor, and now occupies the cases \n\n formerly containing the collection of crania belonging to Dr. Morton. \n\n The members must have observed great improvement in the new \n\n arrangement of the specimens, which have been greatly increased in \n\n number, and each one carefully examined, the bottles and jars contain- \n\n ing them refilled with alcohol, and new labels added. In fact, the extent \n\n and value of this collection could not previously be properly appreciated. \n\n It will now bear comparison with any in this country. \n\n\n\nThe large and fine collection of Birds in skin, possessed by the Academy, \n\n has been thoroughly overhauled, and the imperfect specimens, or which \n\n had sustained injury from insects, have been removed, and the rest disin- \n\n fected by exposing them to a high temperature in a large copper apparatus \n\n provided for the purpose. The collection is now in the best order for \n\n mounting or exchange. \n\n\n\n", 
"December, 1S43.] 337 \n\n\n\nThe accessions to the Library have exceeded those of the year previous. \n\n They consist of one Folio; eleven works in quarto form, including the \n\n Memoirs and Transactions of learned Societies ; sixty-five octavos and \n\n duodecimos, including Journals, Annals, Bulletins, &c; and seventy-two \n\n productions in pamphlet form, or in numbers, consisting of Reports, Pro- \n\n ceedings of Societies, addresses, discourses, memoirs, &c. To these are \n\n to be added several manuscripts, charts and engraved copper plates. Of \n\n the whole number contributed, twenty-nine have been derived from Socie- \n\n ties, k sixty-three from Members, and the remainder, amounting to sixty- \n\n seven, from correspondents, authors, editors, &c. \n\n\n\nThe papers read before the Society, and published in its Proceedings \n\n between the 1st of January and 1st of November of the present year, aie \n\n four in number. The first is by Mr. William Gambel, of this city, and \n\n contains descriptions of some new and rare birds of the Rocky Mountains \n\n and California, the tour of which he has recently made. The second is \n\n from the Messrs. Baird, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and describes two new \n\n species of Tyrannula, from Cumberland county, Pennsylvania. The third by \n\n Mr. Haldeman, is entitled a \"Catalogue of the Carabideous Coleoptera of \n\n South Eastern Pennsylvania, and descriptions of new North American \n\n species of Coleoptera :\" and the fourth paper entitled \" Descriptions of a new \n\n genus, and of twenty -nine new Miocene, and one Eocene fossil shells of \n\n the United States,\" is contributed by Mr. T. A. Conrad. \n\n\n\nThe publication of the Proceedings has been regularly continued during \n\n the year. It has now attained sufficient bulk to authorise the Committee \n\n to bring the first volume to a close with the coming number. On the first \n\n of November last, two years and seven months had elapsed since the first \n\n number was commenced, and in that period 311 pages of matter selected \n\n from the minutes of the meeting have been issued, or an average of about \n\n 120 pages annually. As every care is taken in the style and execution of \n\n this periodical, to render it worthy of the Institution whence it emanates, \n\n and a considerable expenditure is therefore incurred, it is proposed to give \n\n here a condensed summary of the contents of the present volume, as far as \n\n published, in order that some idea may be formed of its merits and utility. \n\n\n\nIts first and most obvious advantage is in being a medium for commu- \n\n nicating to the scientific public discoveries and observations at short \n\n intervals of time, and thus often enabling the claim to priority to be \n\n securely established. There have been, with this view, offered to the So- \n\n ciety, and printed either entire or in part in its Proceedings, during the \n\n period above mentioned, upwards of thirty original papers on scientific \n\n subjects, the titles and authors of which are as follows: \n\n\n\nBy Dr. S. G. Morton, two papers, viz., \" Descriptions of several new \n\n fossil shells from the cretaceous deposits of the United States,\" and \"De- \n\n scriptions of two new species of fossils from the lower cretaceous strata of \n\n New Jersey.\" By Mr. T. A. Conrad, three papers; \"Descriptions of \n\n three new species of Unio from the rivers of the United States ;\" \" De- \n\n scriptions of twenty-six new species of fossil shells from the medial ter- \n\n tiary of Calvert Cliffs, Maryland,\" and \" Descriptions of a new genus, \n\n and of twenty-nine new Miocene, and one Eocene, fossil shells of the \n\n United States.\" By Professor Johnson, two papers; \"An examination \n\n and analysis of coal from Arauco, Chili;\" and \" On the relation between \n\n the coal of South Wales and some Pennsylvania Anthracites.\" By Mr. \n\n Phillips, three papers; \"Descriptions of two new American species of \n\n\n\n",

Baird, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, \"Descrip- \n\n tions of two new species of Tyrannula from Cumberland county, Pennsyl- \n\n vania.\" By Professor Locke, of Cincinnati, \"Observations on Crypto- \n\n lithus tesselatus.\" By J. Hamilton Couper, of Georgia, \" A description \n\n of the strata in which were found the valuable fossil bones and shells \n\n from the Brunswick Canal,\" presented by him to the Academy. By Dr. \n\n Clapp, of New Albany, Indiana, a paper in reference to the geological \n\n equivalents of that vicinity, and of those of the falls of the Ohio. By \n\n Miss Morris, of Germantown, \" Observations on the development of the \n\n Hessian fly.\" By Messrs. Audubon and Bachman, \" Descriptions of \n\n new species of North American Quadrupeds;\" and by Dr. Ravenel, of \n\n Charleston, \" Descriptions of several new fossil Scutellae.\" \n\n\n\nThe communications made before the Society in a verbal form, and re- \n\n corded in the Proceedings, are even more numerous, and contain much in- \n\n formation on important and interesting facts in natural science. The \n\n limits to which this Report is necessarily restricted, will only admit \n\n of the mention of the names of those gentlemen who have most largely \n\n contributed to this portion of the Proceedings. There are from Dr. \n\n Morton, six communications ; from Prof. Johnson, twenty ; Prof. Rogers, \n\n five ; Mr. S. S. Haldeman, four; Dr. B. H. Coates, three; Mr. Phillips, \n\n two ; Dr. George C. Leib, three : Dr. Chaloner, four ; Mr. Joseph A. Clay, \n\n one; Dr. Blanding, one; Dr. Bridges, two; Prof. Bailey of West Point, \n\n one; Mr. Quimby, two ; Dt. Goddard, five; Mr. George R. Gliddon, \n\n two ; Dr. Elwyn, one ; and from Dr. Owen, of New Harmony, two. \n\n\n\nThis publication also records for the period mentioned, 219 donations to \n\n the Museum of the Society from 110 individuals; and 281 donations to \n\n its Library, 68 of which are from Societies, and 213 from individuals. \n\n\n\nAnother most important advantage derived from it is in its general dis- \n\n tribution to foreign and domestic Societies and Correspondents. Nearly \n\n one hundred and fifty copies of each number as it appears are sent, not \n\n only in every direction throughout the Union, but to various sections of \n\n the globe, and a correct knowledge of the character and standing of this \n\n Institution is thus widely diffused. 1 have transcribed from the Memo- \n\n randum Book of the Corresponding Secretary, the following list of Socie- \n\n ties receiving copies of the Proceedings, either regularly or as opportunity \n\n offers : \n\n\n\nRoyal Society of London ; Botanical Society of London ; Zoological \n\n\n\n",

The first reduces the amount of the Initiation fee from $10 to $5, \n\n and the second reduces the amount of a life subscription from $80 to 50. \n\n Both of these alterations have been in contemplation for a length of time, \n\n but no action determined on until within the last few months, when the \n\n expediency and even necessity of adopting them were so obvious as not to \n\n admit of longer delay. The third alteration requires of Correspondents \n\n residing within the United States, elected after the 31st of January, 1843, \n\n a small diploma fee. This is a measure which the Society is justly en- \n\n titled to adopt, and is only in accordance with the usage of most Institu- \n\n tions of a similar character. The demand has been cheerfully complied \n\n with in every instance where the receipt of his notice of election has been \n\n acknowledged by a Correspondent. \n\n\n\nBetween the 1st of January and the 1st of December of this year the \n\n Academy has added eleven new Members and twenty-one Correspondents \n\n to its list. Of the latter, twelve reside in the United States, and nine \n\n are foreign. The number of members elected is nearly double the average \n\n of the three preceding years. \n\n\n\nThe finances of the Academy are in a most favourable condition, as the \n\n Report of the Treasurer will show. The right of way to a small portion \n\n of the lot in the rear of the building, was disposed of in the early part of \n\n the year for the sum of $660, to the holders of the adjoining property. \n\n The offer was an advantageous one to the Academy, and was promptly ac- \n\n cepted by it. A heavy ground rent held by the original owners of the lot \n\n on which this building is erected, has been recently paid off by the next \n\n purchaser. This is a source of some gratification to the Academy, as re- \n\n\n\n46 \n\n\n\n",

By the prudent management of the Treasurer, the Institu- \n\n tion has been enabled to meet all its ordinary annual expenses, and some \n\n new arrangements for the coming year proposed by him, will, if carried out, \n\n materially lessen its remaining obligations, which, although now compa- \n\n ratively light, still prevent that entire appropriation of its annual income \n\n to the general purposes of the Institution, which is so ardently desired \n\n by all its members. \n\n\n\nAll which is respectfully submitted by \n\n\n\nHall of the Academy, December 26th, 1843. \n\n\n\nW.
