I’ll do this now, in the briefest possible terms.\nFellowship Goal:\nCorrectly identify species occurrences (species + place + date) from the text of the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP; 1841-1922)\n\nThis corpus is available at the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL).\nWhy?\nI am interested in how this corpus may be leveraged for historical species occurrence data so that I can contribute toward filling in the sparse occurrence data from this time period. Take a quick look at the data showing all species occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF, from 1800 - 2021. While the scale obscures the actual number of observations prior to 1950 (it’s not zero!), you get the gist of the problem of a lack of “old data.”\nGBIF species occurrences 1800-2021For inquiring minds who want to see the pre-1950 data. The top of the scale (too small to read) is 2M.\nHow?\nI don’t have it all figured out yet, but expect that this will involve many steps of data processing and cleaning, training a natural language processing model on this corpus (which is a weird corpus), exploratory data analysis and visualization, and more. If we can get it to work (and this is a big IF), we will be able to automate identifying realtionships like the one shown below.1 Thisexample includes habitat, but we are focused on the relations between date + place + species.\nExamples of species occurrences automatically extracted by PASMED. A dashed line indicates an incorrect relation.\n\nfrom: Nguyen N, Gabud R, Ananiadou S (2019) COPIOUS: A gold standard corpus of named entities towards extracting species occurrence from biodiversity literature.
