I’ll do this now, in the briefest possible terms.\nFellowship Goal:\nCorrectly identify species occurrences (species + place + date) from the text of the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP; 1841-1922)\n\nThis corpus is available at the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL).\nWhy?\nI am interested in how this corpus may be leveraged for historical species occurrence data so that I can contribute toward filling in the sparse occurrence data from this time period. Take a quick look at the data showing all species occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF, from 1800 - 2021. While the scale obscures the actual number of observations prior to 1950 (it’s not zero!), you get the gist of the problem of a lack of “old data.”\nGBIF species occurrences 1800-2021For inquiring minds who want to see the pre-1950 data. The top of the scale (too small to read) is 2M.\nHow?\nI don’t have it all figured out yet, but expect that this will involve many steps of data processing and cleaning, training a natural language processing model on this corpus (which is a weird corpus), exploratory data analysis and visualization, and more. If we can get it to work (and this is a big IF), we will be able to automate identifying realtionships like the one shown below.1 This example includes habitat, but we are focused on the relations between date + place + species.\nExamples of species occurrences automatically extracted by PASMED. A dashed line indicates an incorrect relation.\nTo accomplish this, we are hoping to use the Python package spaCy. SpaCy is self-described as, “industrial-strength natural language processing in Python.” This powerful package does many things, but the two things it does that we really need are: named entity recognition (it finds words/phrases in the text, and we can give it a list of things to look for) and entity relations (we can train it to know when things are related, like a species and a place).\nMy first step in working toward this very lofty goal, was just to explore around in spaCy a bit. I did that, and you can see what I did in this Jupyter Notebook. The major successes for this first exercise were to run the default spaCy NLP model on a volume of ANSP, to understand how to visualize some of the results:\nspaCy annotations from sample text\nThis shows some of spaCy’s default entity types: CARDINAL (Numerals that do not fall under another type), PERSON, GPE (geopolitical), ORG (organizations), etc. Notice it misses the species mentioned, e.g., ‘Ariolimax niger’.\nand, finally, to create a custom entity set with a few species names, add it to the existing NLP pipeline, and see if it works. It did!\nNER results in spaCy showing the species name highlighted.All in all, this was a very exciting and productive week!\n/a\n\nfrom: Nguyen N, Gabud R, Ananiadou S (2019) COPIOUS: A gold standard corpus of named entities towards extracting species occurrence from biodiversity literature.
