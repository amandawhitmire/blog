A CATALOGUE OF THE FISHES OF GREECE WITH NOTES ON THE NAMES NOW IN USE AND THOSE EMPLOYED BY CLASSICAL AUTHORS.
BY HORACE ADDISON HOFFMAN AND DAVID STARR JORDAN.

The firstnamed author of the present paper spent a large part of the spring and summer of 1890 in Greece.
Part of this time was devoted to making collections of the fishes found in the markets of Athens and to the study of the vernacular names now applied by the Greek fishermen to these fishes.
Each fish as obtained was preserved in alcohol a number attached to it and a record kept of the vernacular name attached to this number.
The persistence of vernacular names of fishes and other animals is known to be very great and it may be safely assumed that the most of these names now heard in Athens are derived from those applied to the same species in the time of Aristotle.
It has been thought that a study of these names would tend to throw light on those applied to fishes by classical authors.
The fact that no such collection or comparison of names of fishes has yet been made is the justification of this paper.
A single catalogue of the fishes of Greece is known to me that published by my friend Professor Apostolides in 1883 La Peche en Grece  par Nicolas Chr.
Apostolides.
This work contains numerous vernacular names and it has been largely drawn upon in the present paper.
In this paper is printed a systematic list of the fishes known from Greece either on the authority of Apostolides or from my own collection wuth the vernacular names and such notes on them as I am able to offer.
No one can be more fully aware than I am of the unsatisfactory character of many things in this paper.
It was often difficult or impossible to make out with certainty just what Aristotle meant.
Some terms occurring over and over and evidently having a very definite meaning to him are obscure to us and the meanings given in the dictionaries are only guesses.
A good illustration of this is the word no'iufm usually translated diaphragm.
We have no right to assume that Aristotle always or ever meant by this term the diaphragm especially in those instances where it makes him entirely wrong in regard to the anatomical facts.
In those matters which could be seen by dissection I feel convinced that Aristotle made the dissections for himself and reported what he saw.
He may not always have seen aright in nice point and he certainly did not understand what he saw as it is understood in the light of modern science  but there is no ground for assuming that he did not see what would be apparent to any one who took the least pains to look even if with unpractised eye.
A striking confirmation of the correctness of his observation in matters of anatomy was aflTorded by the repeated statement that the fidiiayo Lophhis piseatorlus has its gall bladder upon the intestine not upon the liver.
A dissection of this fish by Dr. Charles H. Gilbert proved the statement of Aristotle to be correct.
I believe that a reading of Aristotle in the original accompanied by dissections of the animals in question would bring one to a much better understanding of his anatomical terms which are much in need of some such elucidation.
It is quite otherwise when he comes to the habits of the fishes and other matters than anatomical knowledge.
Here he has to depend upon the observations of the fishermen and others and what he has to say simply records the prevalent beliefs.
Of course much of this fisherman's lore is real knowledge gained from observation but it has also a considerable share of myth.
Another great source of difficulty is corruption of the text.
Considering all the time and the vicissitudes that the Mss.
of Aristotle have passed through it is always more or less problematical as to whether in any given passage we have just what Aristotle said.
For the nomenclature and systematic arrangement of the species the identification of my specimens and for all matters purely zoological in character I am indebted to Dr. David S. Jordan at whose suggestion the work was undertaken.
The specimens obtained are in the museum of the University of Indiana.
Explanatory jS'otes.
1.
The following order of statement has been adopted 1 Scientific name by Dr. Jordan.
2 M. G. Modern Greek name or names heard by me in Greece if any  each name followed immediately by a small figure in parenthesis indicating the number of specimens secured under that name.
3 A reference to the page of Apostolides' book La Peche en Grece par Nicolas Chr.
Apostolides Athens 1883 where the species is given followed by the scientific name used by him and the vernacular name or names given by him.
4 The similar name or names from A. G. Ancient Greek authors chiefly Aristotle references to the places in their works where these names are found and a gathering up of the chief things said about the fish in question especially anything which might in any way help to fix the identity of the species.
Explanatory remarks and comments are thrown in wherever in each case it seems most suitable.
2.
Modern Greek names marked with an asterisk  were heard by me in the market at Athens sometimes elsewhere in Greece but do not occur in Apostolides' list.
3.
Names marked with a dagger j occur in Apostolides but were not heard by me in Greece.
4.
Names not marked by any sign were both heard by me and found in Apostolides.
They are not marked if the variations in form are slight and insignificant even if the forms are not identical.
5.
When the names are derived from other sources the source is given in connection with the name.
6.
The references to Aristotle are taken from the Index Aristotelicus of Hermann Bonitz and as there refer to the age column and line of the quarto edition of Aristotle's works issued by the Royal Academy of Prussia through Georg Reimer Berlin.
The references to Athenaeus mostly from the Vllth book are given by book and section Editio C. Tauchnitii Otto Holtze Leipzig 1887.

According to Aristotle the ova of the a.uUw are grown fast between the branches of the oviduct about the backbone  as these ova increase in size they change their position and move around into one or the other branch of the oviduct which is forked and grown fast to the uowp.a diaphragm peritoneum just as in other similar fishes.
The oviduct of both this and the other Galeodes has at a little distance from the uoatim a kind of white breasts oviducal glands which are not present when they are not pregnant.
The shells of their eggs are shaped like the tongues reeds of pipes aukoi and there are attached to them hairlike ducts.

According to Aristotle the yaXeinre.
the long jeXdyji with uncovered gills on their sides sharks as distinguished from the flat atX.dyr with uncovered gills underneath them rays.
TheaAsoi'areovoviviparous produce at the most three young at a time and admit their oflspring iuto themselves iuto their mouths and let them out again.
The TrncxO.n
and akwzy.ix do this especially but others do not because of their roughness.
The yahoi have a mouth ojening wide literally ' breaking back '.
TQ axaAlia thorny yakeo'i has its ova attached to the v6ZiOJ.a peritoneum 
above the oviducal glands and when the ovum descends upon its having been loosed the young fish is produced.
In the same way generation takes jjlace in the ald7j.
But the socalled smooth yalsoi have their ova between the branches of the oviduct like the ff.ol'jr.
The ova moving about descend into one or the other branch of the oviduct and the young are produced having the umbilical cord attached to the oviduct so that when the eggs are used up these fish seem to have an embryo j ust like the quadrupeds.
In the case of the a.uUo. Avhich some call vfifiiai yaXeoi i. e. yakeoi dappled like a fawn fawncolored sharks when the shell of the egg bursts and fiills off the young fish is born.
There are several kinds of yakeot e. g. aartpuxq y.z'Tpvrfi d.wjOla liloi o'.y.iAo ay.uivM aMexia.

Iq 508b 17 ya.2oi are mentioned among fishes which have many pyloric appendages but this is thought to be a corrupted reading for yj.J.
See above under references.
The yalzoi and yahouhi as d.cor and yjjcu' and the flat fishes vdpy.Tj i3diQ Kz.tuua0 and zpoyu produce their young alive having first produced eggs internally.
The form of the uterus oviduct must be seen from dissections.
The yaXzw have it different from one another and from the flat azhiyr.
For in some cases the ova are grown fast around the back bone between the branches of the uterus oviduct f3Tra just as has been said in the case of the yy.'jUiy.
As the ova increase in size they move around.
The uterus being forked and grown to the v6wij.a diaphragm peritoneum just as that of others of this kind the ova come around into one or the other branch of the uterus oviduct.
Both the uterus of this and that of the other yaXsoetdsl at a little distance from the u6'uj.a.
have what resembles white breasts oviducal glands which are not present when they are not pregnant.
The ya'umoz all have their gills double and five on each side.
They also have the gall bladder on the liver and the two parts of the liver are independent the beginning not being grown together.
The males differ from the females by having two appendages hanging about the vent.

The 5tVj is one of the aeXdyji has the gall on tlie liver has a large tail and copulates belly to belly.
It breeds twice a year in autumn and again about the setting of the Pleiades producing seven or eight young each time.
It allows its young to pass in and out of its mouth.
The phri seems to cross with the 5ro9 and produce the fish called vwoc.
This has the head and fore parts of the 5aro9 but the rear parts of the phq as if born from both.
Like the oio9 5ar9 and 4'irTa it buries itself in the sand and then waves the filaments in its mouth.
It changes its color to that of the rocks on which it is or to that of its other surroundings so that it is not easily seen.

Arist.
gives the following points with regard to the vdpxr  It is a flat aiXfiyoQ and like all such has its gills underneath it and is ovoviviparous.
It has the gall on the liver has a long spiny tail.
It has its dorsal fins transferred to its belly where on account of its shape they will be more useful and its helhj ventral and pectoral 
fins near the head.
It has two fins near or on its tail.
For two fins it uses its flat edges.
The vfifr.r benumbing yapxav izoiouaa the fishes which it intends to catch taking them into its mouth in the way which it has feeds on these.
It buries itself in the sand and mud and captures the fishes swimming up to it which it stuns 'afr.wj oiet.
A proof that they live in this way is that they are often caught having in them the .sfrrpeo one of the swiftest of fishes the dpxrj itself being one of the slowest.
Some persons have been eye witnesses of their mode of capturing their prey.
It is well known that they stun people also.
It hunts little fishes for its food catching them by rendering them numb Qapyjh and unable to move.
The dpxrj and prr spawn a little before the autumnal equinox.
They take their young into themselves their mouths and let them out again.
A large vdpxrj has been seen with about 80 young in it.
Aristotle frequently mentions it in close connection with rpuycuv ldo and pii'r implying that they belong to the same general class.

According to Aristotle the idroi form one division of the rskdyq are flat have a tail xipxa  tail like that of a quadruped.
The word xipxo
is not applied to the tail of a fish such as a sunfish etc.
 they have uncovered gills no opercula have no scales but a rough skin  they have no fins but  swim by means of their flatness itself or as is said in another jlace by means of the outer edge of their flatness.
They have their gills tinder them whereas the ya.sc6hj have them in the side.
The flat selache with tails as the Sfitrov rjioyu.
and the like copulate not only with belly to belly but also by mounting with their bellies upon the backs of the females in those kinds in which the tail is not so thick as to be in their way.
Of the flat fish the idoq and Tpoymj do not receive their young into themselves because of the roughness of the tail.
Some fishes lie quiet in the sand others in the mud keeping only the mouth above.
The T.eTjfv.i'. idoc and rzlayjLlrj lie hid during the wintriest days.
The omi fidrof il7Tza.
and bri bury themselves in the sand and when they have made themselves invisible they wave paddsijtrat those things in their mouths which the fishermen call  rodlets  paCdia or little wands.
None of the other fishes have been seen uniting in copulation with others not of their own kind  but the u'vj and fidrn alone seem to do this  for there is a fish called pvjdoaTo because it has the head and foreparts of the jdzifi but the hind parts of the 'iVry as if born from both of these.
The yolzai and yiutotuJslis as the dlmriz and xua and the flat fishes 'dp.r fidra'i Xzidoonq and zpoywj are viviparous having produced eggs internally i. e. are ovoviviparoiis.

also aeXaym.hi liXayo is a term much used by Aristotle in a broad sense to include a wide variety of fishes.
leXaaxg is also used whether as equivalent to fjiXwo
or in a still more comprehensive sense is not clear.
Pliny ix 24 78 says   There is another kind of fiat fishes which have cartilage for the spine pro spina as the rrn'cp pastinacce sqxiatince torpedo and those which the Greeks call by the names hovis loo
 lamia aquila asro
 and ra7ia dzpayo in which number are also the srrtai although these are not flat ojii.
All these collectively Aristotle called asXAyji he first having given them this name.
We Latins can not give them a distinctive name unless we may be permitted to call them cartilaginous cartilaginea.
I gather the following points from Aristotle Any animal is called a yi.ayo which being without feet and having gills is viviparous or ovoviviparous.
All the askdyr except the idpayoq are externally viviparous having first produced eggs within themselves i. e. are ovoviviparous.
Their uterus or oviduct is forked and extends to the ooZoJiia diaphragm peritoneum.
The fJz.dyri are fidzoi Tfi'jyw'yi pi''T jul Id'j.ta d.z6 dfi.r fldpayoi and all the yahwoi.
They have uncovered gills  some are elongated in form e. g. the yakzui others flat e. g. the jSdo'..
Some of the Jz Adyrj do not have fins viz. the flat ones and those having tails such as iSdrois and tjow'.
These swim by means of the  flatness itself.
But the idpay u has fins and so do all which do not have the flat parts thin.
Some are rough others smooth.
The viviparous fishes such as the jzXdyr have cartilaginous bones are yoydpd.aAla but the oviparous ones have a spine like the backbone pdyii of quadrupeds.
The liver of the ffskdyvj becomes fatty and an oil is melted from it although the Ttyi.yq themselves are very free from fat both in their flesh and abdomen.
They sleep at times so that they are eveu caught with the hand  they take their young into their mouths except the dTpayos are purely carnivorous and most of them have no pyloric appendages  the female is larger than the male and the males can usually be distinguished from the females by two appendages hanging near the vent.
All the 7cM.y6drj have at the same time ova in great numbers above near the t3waa some larger and others smaller while they already have embryos below.
They are rough and without scales.
They lie toi'pid during the wintriest days.
Galen vi 737 derives the name rikayoii from aiM a bright light or blaze or shining.
He says   The skin of such creatures is rough and shining in the night wherefore also some say they have been named jOAyui.

The egg of the y.fh'.g is when laid as large as a grain of vetch.
No pestilential universal
disease attacks the fishes of rivers and ponds but peculiar diseases fall on some of them as the yMii especially.
because it swims near the surface becomes starstruck in the time of the dogstar  it is also stupefied by loud thunder.
The yMyei' in the shallows are destroyed in large numbers by being struck by the dragonserpent.
The river and lake fish are best after the emission of the eggs and semen when they recover their flesh.
The ykfhi'i is not good while pregnant.
In all the rest the males are better than the females but the female Aavj is better than the male.
Of the river fishes the male y'Adyi'i bestows much care upon its young.
The female departs when she has laid her eggs but the male remaining where most of the eggs collect keeps guard over them affording no other assistance except preventing the other small fishes from seizing the offspring.
It does this forty or fifty days until the young having grown are able to escape from the other fishes.

The zpiyiat are caught only as they swim into the Pontus but they are not seen coming out of it.
Whenever one is caught in the neighborhood of Byzantium the fishermen cleanse their nets thoroughly because it is not customary for it to swim out i. e. they cleanse their nets because the catching of one is so unusual a thing as to be considered an evil omen and contaminating.
The reason for this is that they swim up the Ister Danube to where it splits and then come down into the Adriatic.
This is proved by the fact that there the reverse happens  for they are not caught going into the Adriatic but only swimming out.

What they call a difference of male and female in the lyi.o in that the so'called male has the head larger and longer and the female small and pugnosed is not a difference of sex but of species.

Some persons suppose they are produced from the little worms found in some iyjAsc.
This is not true but they are produced from the socalled  entrails of the earth  earthworms which originate spontaneously in the mud and moist earth.
Some eels have already been seen coming out of these earthworms and others may be seen in those pulled to pieces.
But in the sea and in rivers such things are produced especially where there is putrefaction in the sea weed of the sea and about the margins of rivers and ponds where the heat is intense.

They live five or six days out of the water more when they are northern fewer when southern.

All those fishes which are long and smooth as the lyyjkvq and yi'iyyiKi have only two fins.
Some fishes have two gills on each side the one single and the other double as e. g. the yoyyfxx and ffxdpd.

The yoyypoi also have eggmasses yoiimzo
 but the eggmass is not very apparent on account of the fat.
It has a long eggmass just as serpents have.
But when placed upon the fire it makes its nature evident for the fat smokes and melts but the eggs jump and crackle when squeezed out.
And besides if a person feels and rubs them with his fingers the fat feels smooth but the spawn rough.
Now some ytiyypoi have fat but no spawn while others on the contrary have no fat and much spawn as has just been described.
The .diiafjot Spiny lobsters
overpower the yoyypoi  for on account of the roughness of the y.dfiaGiii the yoyypoi do not slip away from them.

IpJjpavm is identical with the form apbpsva given by Apost. as both spellings would be pronounced exactly the same in M. G. Ipip'Mx the usual M. G. form and the only one which I heard is plainly a corruption of the same word.
According to Aristotle the p.uiava is a long fish does not have a crumbling eggmass has no scales eats flesh only is alternately pelagic and littoral lies torpid for a season is stronger than the yoyYpoq and eats off the tail of the Y''y'C ' has no fins and uses the sea as serpents do the land  .
e. moves through the sea iu the same way as serpents move over the ground its gills are not articulated like those of other fish it has four single gills on each side has the gall bladder on the entrails and is long like a snake  they copulate by twining around one another and bringing belly to belly like snakes spawn at any and every season lay many eggs and the young grow rapidly.
The Tj.opi and the Tij.nfa'.a diflfer for the rwpara is variegated and weaker but the riwpo'i is of uniform color and strong and it is colored like the pine tree and has teeth both within and without.
People say just as they say other things that the one is male the other female.
These come out on the dry land and are caught there frequently.
According to Athenaeus Theophrastus says the iyjAU' and p.bpavja can live a long time out of water because they have small gills.

I glean the following points concerning the tunnies from Aristotle  The Oirrin are migratory and run in schools are smooth purely carnivorous and have the net thrown around them sometimes while asleep  the female has a fin called dipo.jitu'i under the belly but the male does not have it  they are at times burst by their fat.
They live two years.
The fishermen think this is proved by the fact that when the 0wA8ei failed one year the Onwot also failed the next year.
They seem to be a year older than the rXaj.bdei.
The Of'r'MH and tmijiixh copulate about the first of April and spawn about the last of June or first of July.
They lay their eggs in a sort of sack.
The growth of the Ow'Ade'i is rapid AVhen they spawn in the Pontus Black Sea there come from the eggs what some call y.n '' An.
'. but the Byzantiaus u.n'ioz'
growers because they grow jjb'dyo in a few days.
They go forth out of the Pontus in autumn with the Owide but return in the spring being already rj.aj.ud.
An old OuwMf has been caught whose weight was fifteen talents 1350 lbs.
 and whose length was five cubits and a span about 8 ft..
The old ones are not good even for salt fish.
The h'ji lie torpid in the depths of the sea in winter and are plumpest after this hibernation.
They begin to be caught about the beginning of summer the rising of the Pleiades and are caught last at the setting of Arcturus winter solstice
.
The Ouwoi most of all fishes take pleasure in warmth and come to the sand near the land for the sake of the warmth because they warm themselves and swim on the surface.
They spawn in the Pontus Black Sea and nowhere else and but once a year.
The Ouwo is good to eat again after Arcturus probably the rising of Arct. about Sept. 15 for during this season it ceases to be afflicted with the olfrroo because of which pest it is inferior during the summer.
The Ob''m and ccftm are infested by the n7Tpu about the dogdays.
At that time they both have by their fins a sort of little worm called olfrzio' like a scorpion and as large as a spider ' v.
These cause them such pain that the vc
leaps out of the water at times no less than the dolphin.
The Oowids'i and rjlajMs'
enter the Pontus in spring and pass the summer there both for food and spawning.
They come out straightway after the Pleiad probably the setting of the Pleiades about Nov. 10.
If the wind is a southern one they swim out more slowly but if northern more quickly because the wind is then for wafting them on.
They swim into the Pontus keeping close to favorable the land on their right but they swim out of it keeping close to the land on the lejV The rry.oj.dfx'.
are weaker than the fh'woL and migrate earlier.
The yiviV spawns in summer about the month Hecatombpeon near the vernal equinox.
It lays a sort of sack filled with many small eggs.
The above are so far as I can make out the main points which Aristotle reports concerning the Ouwoc and OovvctJs.
Whether they are the same the latter merely referring to the females is not altogether clear.
It will be noted that some of the above statements are obscure and others contradictory at least apparently so.

According to Aristotle the 7.dpii has two gills on each side one single and the other double has its stomach shaped exactly like an intestine seems to ruminate just as the quadrupeds do is a bony fish is the only fish whose teeth are not sharp and pointed and is consequently with good reason held to be the only one that ruminates.
Athen.
vii 113 under n.dpn quotes Aristotle as saying that it is not sharptoothed and solitary and carnivorous it has a small mouth and tongue not grown fast much etc.
A passage plainly corrupt.
To make any sense out of it at all we must assume that the negative near the beginning of the quotation has dropped out and replace it.
Otherwise it contradicts what Aristotle has repeatedly said elsewhere and even contradicts the latter part of the passage itself where it is said that the a.dpoq is fond of seaweed and is baited with this.
The statement that the T.dpog chews its cud is made repeatedly in Aristotle and other ancient writers.
Nicander of Tlayatira says there are two kinds of Ty.dii'. one of which is called o'ia donkeycolored the other aloXo brilliant.
This suggests a.apoyaidapo ' scarusdonkey' a name given to one of my specimens of Diplodus vulgaris.
Moreover the names secured by me under D. vulgaris indicate that at the present time the names Txdpog Tdpo and Tdpyoq are all used more or less indiscriminately for all the species of Diplodus.

The fish ipofip'vM is frequently mentioned in Aristotle.

According to Aristotle the ipodpvM'
is a jelagic fish and of both it and the ydwrj the male had never been seen.
He says the most of the fishes are male and female but concerning the ipoi'iprMi and ydyq there is a doubt for all which are caught have eggs in them.
Again he says of those called ipofp'iyoi no male has ever been seen but only females and these full of eggs.
But we have not yet trustworthy observation on this point.
The name means red or reddish and the color of the fish must have justified the name.

It was a favorite food fish.
Athenaeus derives its name fioa from the word yS'fyj' a cry or shout and defends this form of the name and derivation against Aristophanes of Byzantium who says We wrongly call the fish fiwxa 5tti and ought to call it ioina 'i
'noi since being a little fish it has large eyes.
It should be fiowtl'  having the eyes of an ox.
i6ul' is compounded of fino'i stem 5F and w' and appears in Homer in the feminine f rm iomt'S as a common epithet of Hera.
The word means oxeyed largeeyed.
If this is the fish now called ftCoa the authority of Aristophanes of Byzantium prevailed.
At any rate the 5tt was a small fish with large eyes having peculiar markings on its back running in shoals and admired by epicures.

A ritotle says with regard to the ftdrjxiyo'i Inasmuch as the flat front part is not fleshy nature has compensated for this by adding to the rear and the tail as much fleshy substance as has been subtracted in front.
The idrpayuq is called the angler.
He fishes with the hairlike filaments bung before bis eyes.
On the end of each filament is a little knob just as if it had been placed there for a bait.
He makes a disturbance in sandy or muddy places hides himself and raises these filaments.
When the little fishes strike at them he leads them down with the filaments until he brings them to his mouth.
The i3dTfo.yi is one of the azhrjj.
All the azAyq are viviparous or ovoviviparous except the iidrpayjq.
The other flat ahbj have their gills uncovered and underneath them but the drpayo has its gills on the side and covered with skinny opercula not with horny opercula like the fish which are not asXaywdrj.
Some fishes have the gall bladder upon the liver others have it upon the intestine more or less remote from the liver and attached to it by a duct.
Such are idpayoq tMnl TU'ayin jp.hpava and 'icpia.
Proved true of Lophius piscatorius by a dissection by Dr. C. H.
Gilbert.
The ftdrpayo is the only one of the asXdyri which is oviparous.
This is on account of the nature of its body.
For it has a head many times as large as the rest of its body and spiny and very rough.
For this same reason it does not afterwards admit its young into itself.
The size and roughness of the head prevents them both from coming out i. e. being born alive and from going in being taken into the mouth of the parent.
The fidzpayo is most prolific of the ffXdyrj but they are scarce because the eggs are easily destroyed for itlays them in a bunch near the shore.
