This is the only example obtained and was found on the beach.
Though in fair preservation it had been disturbed a little by some crabs which damaged part of the back in the region of the adipose dorsal.
Our species appears related to the European P. coregonoides differing chiefly in the smaller scales and having the teeth in the jaws all minute except the anterior palatines and mandibular canines.
According to Moreau 1 the scales of P. coregonoides are about 64 in the l Poiss.

We have examined a single poorly preserved Mediterranean example from the Bonaparte collection evidently the basis of the latter's figure and description of his P. coregonoides.
2 It shows about 60 scale pockets in the course of the lateral line which do not extend very much posterior to the anal base.
Though the snout and mandible are considerably damaged they show much larger teeth along edges of the latter than on edges of the upper jaw.
The ventrals are inserted behind dorsal origin and the A. iii 24

P. speciosus Belloti differs according to the original account and figure 4 in having the ventrals inserted slightly before the dorsal.
P. borealis Reinhardt said to range south in the Atlantic to Cape Ann has been referred to a different genus chiefly as the ventrals are inserted entirely behind the dorsal.

It may be here noted in this connection that Paralepis usually credited to Risso in 1826 cannot date from then as it first occurs in Bosc this author virtually naming Cuvier's account which is not tenable as proposed in the French vernacular.
6 In Bosc's first account under Coregonus he says le genre Paralepis de Cuvier enleve l'espece de ce nom a celuici 7 and if this be considered inadmissible his next account 8 must be taken.
As the first species P. coregonoides Risso 9 has been virtually allowed the type it may be so considered still.
The occurrence of Paralepis barracudina on our Atlantic shores is of interest not only as a new form and addition to our fauna but also in further mapping out the distribution of the genus.
Barracudina diminutive of Barracuda or Sphyrama to which the species of Paralepis bear a close superficial resemblance.

A REVISION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SPECIES OF THE GENUS ISCHNOPTERA ORTHOPTERA.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN and MORGAN HEBARD.
Some months ago the study of a considerable series of specimens of this genus from North Carolina furnished the incentive for a careful examination of all the material on hand at that time as well as a study of the literature bearing on the genus as present within the limits of the United States and Canada.
The results were so interesting that a number of appeals were made for additional material to enable us to make our examination as complete as possible and the cordial responses placed in our hands for study an extensive and very valuable series from the collections of the United States National Museum the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences and the private collections of Profs.
Lawrence Brunei A. P. Morse and W. S. Blatchley to all of whom our hearty thanks are given for their cooperation.
Primarily this work rests upon the material in the collection of the junior author this representing about onehalf of the five hundred and fiftytwo specimens examined.
The two greatest difficulties encountered in studying the genus were the lack of sex correlation on account of the usually great sexual dimorphism most of the females being considered species of other genera such as Temnopteryx and Loboptera Kakerlac and the confusion or nonrecognition of certain of the older species.
In the present paper every species of the genus known from within our limits has the sexes correlated with the result that Loboptera and Temnopteryx are entirely eliminated from our fauna with the exception of one species of the latter genus known only from the female the discovery of the male of which probably will prove its membership in the genus here treated.
The extent of individual variation in species of the genus is considerable both in size and to a less extent in coloration.
The length of the tegmina is the most variable dimension although its ratio to the general size always remains much the same only departing decidedly in this particular in specimens which are really intermediate in character between two geographic races.
Coloration seldom varies except along the lines of intensification and dilution the cases of presence or absence of a decided pattern within a species being few.
The descriptions have been drawn up to cover as fully as possible the extremes the measurements in all cases representing these except in a few dimensions where the most extreme specimens of a species examined have an identical measurement.
The form of the tegmina in the female sex furnishes one of the most Interesting phases of specific divergence in this genus and it proved to be the rock on which a number of species were split off on one side into Loboptera and on the other into Temnoptcryx.
It is quite apparent that the form of these appendages is much less important in these species than was formerly supposed to be the case as species very similar in general appearance other structures including genital appendages and in coloration will differ considerably in tegminal form although the form and proportions of these are quite constant within specific limits.
Several of the species are difficult to separate in the male sex while the females are quite easy to distinguish  in one case the females of two forms do not appear separable while the males are typically easy to distinguish.
The greater diversity in the females when considered with their pronounced adaptation for life under stones and bark is in decided contrast to the more generalized structure of the males.
In the case of two forms it has been found advisable to use a trinomial as sufficient evidence of intergradation exists in the territory where the ranges overlap to demonstrate beyond a doubt that one is but a geographic form or race of the other.
In these instances the trinomial shows close relationship while a binomial would imply a unit distinction which does not exist.
As several authors have shown the great amount of variability in the number of complete and incomplete rami of the ulnar vein of the wing within specific limits in a number of genera of the Pseudomopince Phyllodrominrv of authors we have not used this character in separating species contenting ourselves with giving in the specific descriptions the ramus extremes of the series examined.
The range of each species has been carefully mapped from the specimens and literature and the distribution of each species is given from its particular chart.
The exact position of Temnopteryx deserke Rehn and Hebard 1 is doubtful but as the discovery of the male will probably show its 1 Proc.

Distribution. This species is now known from localities extending from southern Florida Miami north to southern Pennsylvania Wayne and Enola and northern Indiana Marshall County west to eastern Kansas Douglas County and south to Texas.
The only exact datum for the latter State is the capture of one specimen at Paris in the northeastern portion of the State.
From the known records the species appears to be an inhabitant of the Upper and Lower Austral Zones.
Remarks.
 The males of this species from a number of localities are uniform in size and coloration although the ulnar vein of the wing is variable in the number of complete and incomplete rami which it bears.
The femalas vary considerably in size but there appears to be no correspondence between this and locality.
The largest specimens are from Raleigh N. C and Miami Fla. the smallest from Raleigh and Jacksonville Fla.
The mature specimens were taken or bred out on date in May June July and August the only specimens taken the latter month being from Miami Fla.
The immature specimens were secured in March April May and September the last month being represented by one specimen taken at Sulphur Springs N. C. Specimens examined.

Distribution.
 The only previous records for the species are given in the leading references while the material now in hand from De Funiak Springs Jacksonville and St. Augustine Fla. and Florida carries the range to the south and west.
The species is now known from Georgia and Florida all the definite records being from the northern half and western extension of the latter State.
Remarks.
 The junior author while in London several years ago examined the type of nigricollis in the British Museum and the association of the material in hand with this species is warrant d by his notes and recollections.
His notes are as follows .
nigricollis Ga. Abdomen absent.
Right half of pronotum damaged.
Pronotum uniform dark brown same shade as central part of pronotum of dark I. pensylvanica.
Wings shining pale color of I. johnsoni legs.
toward the base and extending up the middle they are slightly darker.
Legs same color as those of .
johnsoni.
Several sketches accompany the notes making the identity even more positive.
The small series of this species examined by us is sufficient to show that its relationship is very close to .
deropeltiformis the males also looking like pale editions of .
johnsoni from which however the female can immediately be separated by the shape of the tegmina.
The only specimen we have examined with date was taken in April.

Distribution.
 The range of this species is now known to extend from eastern Massachusetts Wellesley and northeastern Indiana Steuben County south to southern Florida Dade County and west to eastern Texas Hockley.
Its zonal distribution appears to be Upper and Lower Austral trespassing on the lower portion of the Transition.
Remarks.
 In the male sex this species appears to decrease in size southward Georgia and Florida material of that sex being considerably smaller than New Jersey and North Carolina individuals although the single Texan male seen is equal in size to North Carolina specimens In the female sex however this geographic variation is not apparent and it is possible that the apparent size correlation in the male may be due to the rather small size of the series examined.
The dates on material range from February to October the form being from New Jersey the latter from Maryland.

Remarks.
 Mr. A. N. Caudell has compared one of the female specimens before me with Scudder's type and his notes show them to be the same.
The correlation of the sexes is made with a considerable degree of certainty chiefly however on account of the absence of any other species of native roach belonging to this subfamily in a good portion of the territory over which this species is distributed.
From the material in hand the species appears to decrease in size southward as a male from Lower California is considerably smaller than individuals of the same sex from the Los Angeles region and much inferior in size to Ormsby County Nevada and one of two Oregon specimens.
This however may not be more than individual variation as the other Oregon male has the tegmina but little longer than the Lower California specimen although the pronotum is very appreciably larger.

Distribution.
12  The fact that .
pensylvanica and .
incequalis are really geographic races of the same species merging one into the other makes the delimiting of the range of either one quite difficult and it has been necessary to restrict our consideration to material actually in hand records based on the same and references bejond question on account of the occurrence of but one of the two forms in that region.
From such evidence .
pensylvanica is known to range from Quebec Province Canada Montreal and Abbotsford south to North Carolina 10 Occasionally the maculation is obsoletely divided mediolongitudinally by obscure ochraceousrufous.
11 The smallest specimen available has tegmina as long as the largest.
The tegmina range in size down to 10.5 mm.
12 Owing to the close relationship of Ischnoptera pensylvanica and .
p. inosqualis and the intergradation of the same in the central West it is extremely dimcult and sometimes impossible to properly place references.
The references here given cannot be satisfactorily located without securing the material on which they are based this being impossible in a number of cases.

Its intergradation with .
p. incequalis is known to take place in Indiana as from that State typical material of each has been taken in addition to other almost intermediate in character.
What the distribution of the species in the northern lake States and Ontario is can only be conjectured but its presence in Polk County Wisconsin is evidenced by a typical though rather pale male example.
Its vertical range appears to extend from sealevel to at least 2500 feet Sulphur Springs N. C.
The dates on the niateri  before us range from May to August.
Remarks.
 In size there is considerable variation in both sexes apparently without relation to locality and in coloration the range in intensity is considerable equally individual in character as far as can be determined.

Distribution.
 From the material in hand and undoubted references this form is known to range from Minnesota Illinois Indiana and Nebraska south to northern Mexico having been recorded from Iowa Kansas Oklahoma and Texas in addition to the States previously mentioned.
It is quite probable that this race will be found to occupy the greater portion of the Mississippi Valley intergradating to the east with .
pensylvanica and westward extending to the edge of the Great Plains penetrating the sandhill country of Nebraska along the river valleys as records from Badger and Valentine testify.
Typical material has been examined from Crawford Lake Marshall Marion and Vigo Counties Ind.
Other material from Crawford County approaches .
pensylvanica.
Its vertical distribution appears to be from near sealevel Columbus Tex.
to the above mentioned Nebraska localities situated two thousand to two thousand five hundred feet above the sea.
Its seasonal appearance extends from May to September according to data in the material examined.
Remarks.
 The typical condition of this race is rather decidedly marked and but for the presence of intermediate material it would have to be considered a valid species.
However the testimony of such material as we have been able to examine from Indiana demonstrates intergradation with the eastern and northern .
pensylvanica.
There is no doubt about the identity of Scudder's Temnopteryx marginata with this species as the description absolutely fits the adult female but unfortunately a prior Ischnoptera marginata Brunner 1865 precludes the use of the name for this species.

Distribution.
 Available data show that the present species ranges from Southern New Jersey Anglesea to Georgia west to North Mexico and northward in the Mississippi Valley at least as far as Northwestern Tennessee Rives.
The data are so meagre that almost no idea of its vertical range can be formed.
The dates on the material range from Mf 22 to July 23.
Remarks.
 After careful comparison this name has been placed on this species and in all the characters but two given in the brief original diagnosis the males in the present series agree the two being the number of rami of the ulnar vein of the wing and the shape of the supraanal plate.
Saussure and Zehntner give for the former ramis apicalibus 3 incompletis 12 iistructa the latter holding true for the material in hand three sometimes present but the number of complete rami is four to six suggesting that even greater variability than our specimens exhibit is present in the species or that the original 3 was a typographical error for five.
Regarding the supraanal plate it is produced to a certain extent mesad with the margin rotundatotruncate and Saussure and Zehntner's u lamina supraanali rotundata probably means in contradistinction to the more markedly trigonal form found in some species of the genus.
This form is very closely related to .
pensylvanica but what position it should bear in reference to the latter species can only be determined when more material and information is available.
The very pale color or almost absence of coloration combined with the decided pronotal maculation makes the males appear quite distinct while the supraanal plate has a different facies although the form of the latter portion is occasionally approached in otherwise quite typical pensylvanica.
The tegminal characters of the female the form of the pronotum and of the subgenital plate differentiate that sex although some individuals of pensylvanica are hard to separate.
However no female individuals of the latter species have been seen with tegmina as short or as acute or with a subgenital plate as blunt and as sinuate laterad as in divisa.

 This species is now known to C.  female  Chester1 town Md.
range from Delaware and Maryland Chestertown and Laurel south to at least northern Florida Jacksonville west to at least eastern Texas Hockley north to Iowa and southern Indiana Crawford County.
Outside of our limits it is also found in Mexico.
Its vertical distribution extends from sealevel to twentyfive hundred feet elevation Sulphur Springs.
The dates on the material in hand range from January to August.
Remarks.
 The synonymy of this species has been established after a very critical examination of the descriptions and the study of an extensive series of specimens including the type of hyalina.
The possibility of couloniana and major being the same has been suggested by Blatchley 20 but no attempt has been made up to the present time to determine the true status of the names here synonymized.
Saussure and Zehntner's Temnopteryx major was of course based on the shortwinged female aud Brunner himself has shown the identity of lata with couloniana 21 while the possession of the type of hyalina enables us to place Scudder's species with certainty.
There is a very perceptible amount of color variation in this species.
of which the more usual type is that described by Blatchley 22 and found in the type of hyalina the disk of the male pronotum being pale reddish ochraceous while the other extreme to which belonged the type of couloniana has this area more or less infuscate particularly cephalad.
The depth of this infuscation is variable and it is sometimes only suggested by points and lines.
In the female much the same thing occurs as in the male but usually less clearly defined.
Such variation in size as is found appears to be purely individual and has no geographic correlation.
Some male specimens of this species bear a considerable resemblance to individuals belonging to the pensylvanicainxsqualis type but we Orthopt.

 The identity of unicolor with uhleriana has been established by Scudder and breeding experiments by Caudell have demonstrated the specific identity of uhleriana and Temnopteryx virginica which latter was based on the shortwinged female.

Distribution.
 This austral race of .
uhleriana is known to range from southeastern Virginia Lake Drummond east central North Carolina Raleigh and southern Indiana Crawford County south to at least central Florida Ormond Eustis and Fort Reed and southern Texas Brownsville west to southeastern Arizona Huachuca Mountains.
The material   g examined was taken on dates ranging from  .March to August.
Fi S s J 9 and fjJt 6 noptera uhleriana Remarks.
 Saussure and Zehntner's TemnofulvescensSLUss.and pteryx texensis appears to be an absolute fnKate ofdX 5 synonym of their fidvescens which has page andx4.
Male precedence to warrant its usage texensis having ImlloXomhna
been based on the female while fulrescens was applied to the male.
The center of maximum differentiation of this form is in Texas individuals from that State usually having the characters separating the race from uhleriana most decided.
The size does not vary greatly in Texas and North Carolinan individuals but in southern Georgia and Florida there is a great diversity in size of males quite small specimens being in the minority in the Thomasville series and in the majority in the Jacksonville lot while the single Eustis Florida male is the smallest seen and furnishes the minimum measurements given above.
From this it appears probable that the form decreases in size southward in Florida.
The coloration varies but little the most striking type being that seen in the figure of Temnoptcryx texensis vide supra which is almost matched in a female before us from Brownsville Texas otherwise inseparable from Florida individuals.
There is it might be added some slight variation in the amount of sinuation to the distal margin of the female tegmina.
The specimen from Lake Drummond Va. shows strong tendencies toward true uhleriana.

It is very probable that Saussure and Zehntner's New Mexican record belongs to this species in which case its range is carried eastward some distance.
The only dates on material are in July and August.
Remarks.
 This is one of the most interesting species of the genus seen by us its supraanal characters in the male being quite peculiar.
The real relationship of the female has as witnessed by the references to Saussure and Zehntner and the present author been entirely misunderstood and the examination of the male enables us to assign it to a position apart from the interrelated uhleriana group.
Saussure and Zehntner's Ischnoptera uhleriana vide supra was a composite not including the true uhleriana.
and it is impossible to assign the localities to the respective components.

Distribution.
 The material before us proves that this species has the most extensive range of any form of the genus found in North America.
The localities represented extend from Massachusetts Wellesley northern Indiana Lake and Kosciusko Counties northern Illinois Iowa and eastern Colorado south to northern Florida Fernandina Alabama Auburn and western Arkansas Men a.
Its vertical range extends from sealevel to twentyfive hundred feet elevation Sulphur Springs.
The zonal distribution of the species appears to be Upper and Lower Austral slightly and probably more extensively encroaching on the Transition region.
The dates represented are all in the months of May June and July.
Remarks.
 It is most remarkable that this species should have been sso generally overlooked but few authors having reported it when it is the most generally distributed of any single form of the genus in our region.
Its great superficial resemblance to .
uhleriana has no doubt caused its confusion with that species but the shape of the .supraanal plate will readily distinguish the males of the two.
The female is distinctly smaller and with usually more rounded tegmina than the same sex of uhleriana but otherwise is much the same.
There is considerable individual variation in size in the male sex rand probably equally as much in the female but the size of the series of the latter sex is not sufficient to determine this.

Distribution.
 The published records and available material show that the present species ranges from eastern central Raleigh and western Sulphur Springs and Tryon North Carolina and eastern Kansas Douglas County south to at least northcentral Florida Ormond and extreme southern Texas Brownsville westward to New Mexico.
Its known vertical range is thus seen to be from sealevel to at least two thousand and five hundred feet Sulphur Springs and probably considerably higher on the strength of the New Mexican record but lack of exact locality in the latter case deprives it of much of its importance.
The specimens were all taken in the months of May and June.
Remarks.
 There seems to be little doubt in our minds as to the propriety of synonymizing Kakerlac schaefferi with this species as while no breeding experiments have been made to verify the opinion schaefferi possesses the characters and coloration one would expect in the female of bolliana after having studied the sexes of forms like johnsoni deropeltiformis and americana the latter being an absolute parallel in the degree of differentiation of the sexes.
The pale form seems to be most prevalent in material from northeastern Texas the only specimens seen by us in this phase being from Paris Texas and one from Texas Belfrage without further data.

As this species has recently been well described and figured it seems unnecessary to redescribe it in this paper.
The type is still unique and the probability of its being the female of a species of Ischnoptera is so great that we have placed it tentatively at least as a valid species of the genus under consideration.

Distribution.
 This species is known from but three localities viz. Tryon N. C Crawford County Ind. and Shovel Mountain Tex.
Remarks.
 The opportunity to examine the female type of this species enabled us to clear up the perplexing problem raised earlier in the work by the other specimens.
The male is not widely different from that of bolliaiui and the Tryon female was badly damaged minus tegmina and repaired so that one hesitated to found any conclusions upon it.
The Crawford County female however removed this uncertainty and enabled us to properly place the material.
This species is related to .
occidentalism the only other North American species with long wings in the female sex from which however it can be readily separated by the much smaller size and paler coloration.

 Edgar T. Wherry Ph.D. remarked that the region is occupied by two PreCambrian effusive igneous rocks a rhyolite and a basalt both considerably altered.
The latter was probably the first to form the acid rock being in part in dikes cutting through it and a contact exposed during recent mining operations showing a rhyolite lava overlying basalt.
The deposits consist chiefly of native copper in quartz veins in epidotized layers in the basalt lava.
It is believed that the metal was originally distributed throughout this rock and has been concentrated like the associated quartz in obedience to the principle that large crystals grow at the expense of small ones that the reduction to metallic copper was brought about by the ferrous iron of the rock constituents that the copper was transported as a dilute solution of free metal by the circulating waters and that the association with epidote is of physical rather than of chemical significance in that the epidotized layers were the only ones of sufficiently resistant character to permit of the development of open cracks during the regional metamorphism.
The workableness of the deposits depends upon the continuity of these epidotebearing layers and their included quartz veins in depth but since no explanation can be given for the epidotization of certain layers of the rock it seems impossible to predict this from present indications and extended drilling is thought to be the only way to settle the question as to the future of the district.

BY T. CHALKLEY PALMER.
The anomalous diatom here to be dealt with was first made known by Mr. William A. Terry of Bristol Conn. the veteran collector and student of the Diatomacese whose enterprise has brought to light so many new forms.
He collected it on Fall Mountain Conn. in 1890 and during the same year Dr. D. B.
Ward made a number of arranged mounts of the valves.
These were distributed together with photographs showing two of the curious upper valves side by side under the name Stauroneis terryana Ward.
This name was almost immediately and very properly amended by Dr. Ward at the suggestion of Prof. Hamilton L. Smith to Stauroneis terryi.
One of Dr. Ward's slides and a vial of the Fall Mountain material containing the diatom were sent by Mr. Terry in 1892 to J.
A. Tempere who in turn forwarded a specimen to Prof. P. T. Cleve.
The first literary result was the noting of a new variety in Cleve's monograph.

Now the sparse characterization in Cleve's monograph would seem to point anywhere except toward a recognition of the essential characters of Mr. Terry's diatom and the impression of an existing misconception is amply confirmed by the figure in Schmidt's Atlas.
Whatever may finally be determined concerning the relationship between this diatom and Stauroneis acuta a reduction to varietal rank must base itself on something more to the purpose than a oneline description and a single figure of some form other than that which was named Stauroneis terryi by Dr. Ward.
The only other publication relating to this diatom which is known 1 Synopsis of the Naviculoid Diatoms P. T. Cleve 1894.
3 A. Schmidt Atlas der DiatomaceenKunde  Tafel 242 fig.
1 September 19Q3.
to me is Mr. Terry's own account 3 of its discovery on Fall Mountain with some reference to the very odd features of the upper valve.
During July of 1909 I received from Mr. Terry sundry vials of diatoms collected on Fall Mountain in 1891 with a request for the preparation of a number of arranged mounts each of which was to show the upper valve the lower valve and the complete frustule of Stauroneis terryi.
Some of this material was labelled fossil and some  recent.
It consisted very largely of Stauroneis acuta together with its varieties among which one might easily imagine  var.
terryana Tempere.
But the diatom so tardy in the matter of obtaining recognition though present merely in traces was in such marked contrast with all these that no special difficulty was experienced in culling it from its multitudinous associates.
During the preparation of the slides a certain curious or even unprecedented feature was noticed in many of the intact frustules  a feature neither shown by Dr. Ward's preparations and photographs nor mentioned in any previous reference to this diatom.
This was brought to Mr. Terry's attention and at his request I have had proper illustrations made of the whole form and present the following description of the diatom.
Stauroneis terryi D. B.
Ward ined.
Frustule fusiform slightly arcuate in girdle view the upper valve more convex than the lower.
Valves dissimilar the upper partly enclosing the lower.
No girdle bands the valves held in place by a broad external silicious ring at the middle part.

Upper valve 370400 u long 5560 a broad.
Strongly convex transversely swollen at the middle diminishing with concave outlines to long bluntly rounded apices and bearing a large oval depression toward each end wherein the raphe terminates in a fine waved line axial hyaline area rectilinear expanding spatulately around subterminal depressions.
Lower valve slightly smaller in all dimensions without subterminal depressions apices more slender with lumen formed by a conspicuous thickening of the inner terminal margin raphe continued approximately to end of valve hyaline area rectilinear to the lumen then narrowing almost to a point.
Stauros on both valves widening outward.
Striae 12 in 10  nearly normal to periphery throughout punctse becoming coarser and striae more sparse around ends of upper valve.

Fall Mountain Conn. W. A. Terry 1890.
This diatom presents several curious features.
It is the largest by far of the genus Stauroneis.
It is the only one of the genus to show subterminal depressions on the valves.
It is the only naviculoid diatom known to me that has a silicious belt about its middle part.
For these and other reasons it is of the greatest interest.
The anomalous features specified might easily lead to the suspicion that we have here a monstrous form a sport an abnormal condition of the species with which it is associated Stauroneis acuta W. Smith.
This idea might seem to find some confirmation in the fact that the striation and punctation and the shape of the lower valve are approximately those of that species.
But monstrous forms do not usually if ever continue to produce themselves indefinitely so that one shall find them in both the mud beneath and the water above.
Monstrosities do not like this form recur not only for years and years in one place but also in other ponds and streams of the same region.
4 Monstrosities are not like this diatom fairly uniform in characters so that one picks out hundreds of quite similar specimens from the material.
Whatever may be the relationship.
Mr. Terry's diatom is something more than a teratological condition of St. acuta.
Some possibilities suggest themselves.
Unquestionably the relationship is close.
The peculiar silicious thickening at the ends of the lower valve is precisely alike in both and this is a very significant fact.
The striation and the beading are essentially similar.
The lower valve apart from its size might upon superficial study be thought identical with the valves of St. acuta.
The outline of this diatom however is different even in the lower valve.
Also the walls of both valves are thinner and the whole frustule is more nearly circular in crosssection.
The size is relatively colossal being more than twice as long as the ordinary St. acuta.
There are no girdlebands in any of the hundreds of frustules examined or mounted nor were any bands found in the accompanying material that could possibly belong to this form.
No instance of reduplication has been observed and as a consequence the ultimate fate of the unique silicious ring or belt is not known though one must think its rupture a condition precedent to this process.
Some of these features might seem to point toward the conclusion  Mr. Terry finds it in three widely separated ponds in Bristol.
Rhodora August 1907. that we have here a sporangia
condition.
This view would carry with it an explanation of the comparative rarity of the diatom in the gatherings of Mr. Terry.
But on such an hypothesis one would expect to find in this rich material some indication of the process of return to normal form.
Nothing of this sort has yet been seen.
However negative evidence answers no questions.
Plainly enough a study of the lifecycle of this diatom is a desideratum.
Not only might such a study clear up the question of relationships within the genus  in Mr. Terry's form we have extrageneric characters and they may easily prove to be of great significance in solving the problem of the genetic connections of Stauroneis  but such a study will necessarily be carried on with living material.

A NEW DIATOM.
BY T. CHALKLEY PALMER.
Iii April and May of 1905 and at about the same season in later years gatherings from swampy pools near Media Pa. often showed little groups of freely motile naviculoid diatoms.
These groups attracted notice from the curious circumstance that they seemed always composed of four individuals.
Also they were essentially unlike any filamentous forms such asEunotia and Melosiru and differ equally with the short blocks of Gomphonema Stauroneis.
etc. which may temporarily remain in contact after reduplication.
All of these and with them the chains or bands of infinitesimal Naviculae of the group Diadesmis are alike in that the contact between adjacent frustules is by the joining of valve to valve.
But these were joined girdle to girdle so that the group as a whole moved about with four parallel raphes in approximate contact with the substratum while four other parallel raphes were in evidence on the top.
Staining with Bismarck brown and tannin showed each group to be enclosed in a mass of coleoderm.
This coleoderm of varying consistency sometimes coagulates in place under the treatment and sometimes being more fluid and expanded collapses confusedly as a brownish cloud upon the supporting slide Plate XXXV fig.
1.
These groups were at first supposed to constitute merely a temporary condition of some wellknown species and search was made for the same diatom in the isolated state normal to the Xaviculse especially to the species of the Pinnularia 1 division of the genus to which the form obviously belongs.
But the groups have continued to occur while the isolated diatom has been nowhere visible.
Moreover a closer study of the frustule has indicated a new and curious species.
In May 1909 rich gatherings were made of this diatom from swampy pools near Media several miles from the places where it had first been observed in 1905.
Accompanying it were a few Navicula major and .V.
viridis Kutz. together w T ith vast numbers of Closterium sp. long strands of Hyalotheca sp.
and other desmids.
Preparations were made 1 Treatment of the NaviculaPinnularia question herein is that of H. Van Heurck and most recent writers except P. T. Cleve.
by various methods and primarily by burning on the coverglass and mounting in Canada balsam.
I owe to Mr. C. S. Boyer who received some of this material the first intimation that these groups of four frustules may come intact through a careful boiling in nitric acid and bichromate continued long enough to destroy entirely all accompanying organic matter and with it of course that belonging to the diatoms themselves  a fact I have confirmed by repeated trials.
Disintegration of groups takes place only on vigorous boiling and agitation.
This indicates the grouping to be maintained by silicious cementing of the edges of the valves.
The peculiar habit of growth seems persistent and this will appear more clearly in subsequent notes of the occurrence of these groups at widely separated places.
The species may be described as follows Navioula socialis sp.
nov. PI.
XXXV figs.
1 and 2.
Frustules normally in motile groups of four held with girdlesides together by a silicious cementing of adjacent valveedges and enclosed in a common coleoderm.
Valves linearelliptic sides slightly concave ends obtusely rounded.
Transverse costae prominent nearly parallel except around terminal nodules alike on both valves 8 in 10 x wider than intervening spaces showing obscurely a longitudinal band.
Raphe nearly straight and simple.
Longitudinal hyaline area nearly onethird the width of valve much contracted near terminal nodules slightly and unsymmetrically expanded around central n dt le.
Length of valve 60120  breadth 1327 .
Fresh water Swampy pools near Media Pa.
Type in cabinet of T. C. Palmer.
This species has a superficial resemblance to some forms of Navicula viridis Kiitz.
and the possibility is recognized that frustules isolated from normal grouping by usual methods of preparation may have been referred to that species.
Certainly the list of forms grouped under that name by authors is long and perhaps loose.
N. viridis however which frequently accompanies this species in typical condition always shows in marked contrast as regards shape of valve less parallel costae and more curved complex raphe as well as in the absence of grouping into motile chains of four.
N. viridis var.
commutata Grunow has dissimilar valves or if we shall follow Cleve 2 in his rather puzzling rearrangement of this group of forms var.
commutata differs in its more approximate costse 10 to 12 in 10 x and their divergent tendency in the middle portion.
Still following Cleve var.
fallax Cleve also 2 P. T. Cleve Synopsis of the Naviculoid Diatoms II p. 91. differs in the closer costse 10 to 12 in 10 jj.
and in the frequent unlikeness of the valves by the unilateral interruption of the costse on one of them though there is here some agreement in the nearly parallel costse.
Neither in Cleve's descriptions nor in the figures cited by him in Schmidt's Atlas 3  does the present form find convincing presentation.
The nearest approach is in Schmidt's Atlas pi.
42 figs.
11 and 12 but even in these which are in outline an approach there are recognizable differences beyond that very notable one which applies here as well as elsewhere  the normal grouping of the species herein described into motile chains.
If such grouping has been heretofore observed in related species it does not find mention in the usual authoritative works nor is a similar condition of N. viridis known to me.
Mounts of the diatom having been distributed to some extent it was interesting to find Mr. W. A. Terry able to send material from Fall Mountain Conn. which contained it in considerable abundance.
This was received in July 1909.
It showed the usual grouping and rather larger frustules than those collected by myself.
Mr. F. J. Keeley who had made fine gatherings in May at the same time and place as myself collected it also in characteristic condition during the summer at Dogtown Common.
Cape Ann Mass.
He also detected it in the usual groups in some of his preparations of material from near Philadelphia.
Near Media it is frequent in boggy places during the summer and until the pools dry out though seldom in much abundance.
It goes without saying that a history of the lifecycle of this diatom which will necessarily include an account of the formation of these groups is much to be desired.
At present it is not easy even to understand the process of ordinary reduplication in the case of this form.
If the groups do not multiply by simultaneous subdivision of their constituent frustules there would soon be irregular groupings.
If the subdivision is simultaneous good gatherings should show superposed groups.
Neither of these conditions have been seen.
4 Meantime the practical advantage of the grouping is evident enough s. far as concerns a motility dependent to a great degree on contact of the raphe with the substratum.
An isolated Navicula with considerable breadth of valve may easily find itself disadvantageous on its girdle and no irregularity of the solid bottom within reach.
A struggle to right itself is the usual consequence of such a condition.
3 A. Schmidt Atlas der DiatomaceenKunde.
Occasional groups of two or three frustules will be seen in rich gatherings and a few containing six to eight all in one plane have been noted.
But the normal number is unquestionably four.
But the shallow tabular group of Navicula socialis is in very stable equilibrium upon its four raphes and it does not readily fall a victim to such accidents.
