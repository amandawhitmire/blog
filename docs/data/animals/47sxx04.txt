NEW AND OTHERWISE INTERESTING TERTIARY MOLLUSCA FROM TEXAS.
BY GILBERT D. HARRIS.
While employed as Tertiary paleontologist to the Geological Survey of Texas during the years 1892 and 1893, the writer prepared a large monograph on the Tertiary mollusca of the State with the intention of publishing it in the 5th Annual Report of that Survey.
For want of funds the printing of this report has been indefinitely postponed, and accordingly the following facts and descriptions of new species, taken from the monograph in question, have here found an appropriate place for publication.
The points in stratigraphy brought out by the study of the various Tertiary faunas of the State have been included with other matter in an article published by the State Geologist in the Journal of Geology, 1894, p. 549.
Suffice it to say here that the Midway stage, so well developed in Georgia and Alabama and known also in Mississippi and Arkansas, exists also in Texas, as is proved by the occurrence of such species as Enclimatoceras ulrichi, Ostrea pulaskensis, Cucullcea macrodonta, Volutilithes limopsis and others.
The Lignitic stage, so far as has been observed, is destitute of molluscan remains.
The exposure on Brazos River, known as "Smiley's Bluff," two miles above the mouth of Pond Creek, is evidently about synchronous with the Matthews Landing beds of Alabama.
These are now included in the Midway stage.
The Lower Claiborne beds are replete with fossils, many of which are common to this horizon in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina.
Besides these well-known forms there are many new ones, some of which are described below.
The true Claiborne, the Jackson, and the Vicksburg stages seem to have no representatives in Texas.
This fact cannot be too strongly emphasized since most writers on Texas geology have referred certain fossil bearing outcrops to some of these upper Eocene stages.

Genus LEDA.
Leda bastropensis nov. sp.
PI.
1, fig.
3.
Specific chararlerizntion.
— General form as figured; medial portions of the valves with regular, strong, concentric stria?
; stria?
obsolete on the anterior end and on the post-umbonal slope, the latter with a shallow furrow extending from the umbo to near the extremity of the valve; within the valve, a raised line or ridge, emanating from the umbonal region and extending along beneath the hinge finally terminates in the middle of the posterior end and is there slightly enlarged.
This species differs from L. plicata Lea in its lack of striation over portions of the exterior, and the more central positions of the umbones.
From L. mater Mr., bastropensis is distinguished by its want of anterior radiating sulci, its lack of post-umbonal striation, and by its form.
This is readily distinguished from L. albirupina Har.
since it lacks the smooth Yoldia-like aspect about the umbones so characteristic of that species.

7.
Specific characterization.
— General form as figured ; ribs about twentyfour, compound, i. e. , broad at base, surmounted by a medial dentate carina; umbonal ridge prominent.
This species is remarkable for its quadrangular form and.
the prominence of its umbonal ridge.
It belongs to the alticostata stock and is most nearly allied to Cardita subquadrata Con.
(Jr. Ac.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila., 2d Ser., 1848, p. 128, pi.
14, fig.

Specific characterization.
— Size and general form as indicated by the figures ; surface in typical specimens marked by strong concentric rugae especially towards the base; these slope gently above but abruptly below and are superimposed by fine striae; umbones flattened.
This species shows great variations in form and size as well as markings.
At Collier's Ferry some specimens are more elongated, others more rotund ; some have crenulations on the interior submargin while others are smooth.
Several of these forms are shown by the figures cited.

Specific characterization.
— General form as figured; exterior smooth about the umbones, but marked by lines of growth auteriorly and sub-basally; hinge and marginal crenulations as in C. alta Con.
This species is closely allied to C. alta, but is distinguished by its proportionally longer form and its smooth umbones, the latter feature being in marked contrast with the corrugations of C. alta.
It evidently does not attain the large dimensions of Conrad's species.

This is certainly very distinct from antestriata.
Besides the points of difference mentioned by Heilprin the following may be noted : The umbonal ridge is much sharper in texana, and there is a trace of a sinus just below it ; the posterior margin is not sub-biangular as in antedi iata, and the valves are less oblique.
From trapaquara this species can be distinguished by its surface markings, lower form, and the depression just below its umbonal ridge.

Specific characterization.
— Size and general forms as indicated by the figures; surface generally smooth about the umbones, but often more or less corrugated concentrically towards the base, especially posteriorly ; lunule in the larger specimens, very indistinct in the smaller forms bordered by a well incised line.
The surface markings resemble somewhat those of C. nuttalliopsis Heilp.. but the anterior and posterior are too pointed, the shell in general too inflated, and the umbonal angle too great for that species.
The larger specimens resemble M. californica Con.

Specific characterization, — General form as figured ; beaks prominent, turned anteriorly ; anterior side often very elongate ; posterior generally short, obtusely pointed, with an obtuse angle midway of the posterior dorsal margin ; umbonal ridge rounded ; post-umbonal slope of considerable width and nearly at right angles to the face of the valve ; substance of the valve moderately thick.
The young of this species have a decidedly Schizodesma appearance.
Older specimens assume the general form of Hemimactra elongata of the Indo-Pacific region.
This species is known only in the form of casts in a light gray sandstone.
It is regarded as a Mactroid shell, and not a Macoma, because (a) the beaks point anteriorly; (b) there is no indication of a twisting posteriorly; (c) the hinge margin of this shell is thick and evidently bore well-developed lateral teeth ; (d) the posterior is very obtuse.

The specimen in the collection of the Academy is of about the form and size of that represented by fig.
6, though it shows more prominent denticulations on the spire, approaching fig.
6b in this respect.
Specimens of this species in the U. S. Nat.

collection from Wood's Bluff, Ala. , are slightly stouter in form, i.e., have a shorter spire.
This, however, is not always the case, for Aldrich's type from this locality is of nearly the normal form.
The Alabama specimens all show denticulations on the upper spiral stria?, a feature apparently overlooked by Aldrich when describing his Tuomeyi.

This species shows considerable variation at Claiborne.
As a rule the larger specimens are not so strongly cariuated as the specimen herewith illustrated.
The type specimen of Fusus nanus at the Philadelphia Academy has been compared with the Texan form and there seems to be no reason for doubting their identity.
Meyer was right in referring this species to Pleurotoma, and PI.
nana would stand were it not for the fact that Deshayes in 1824 (Desc.

des Env.
de Paris, p. 482, vol.
2, pi.
68, figs.
19, 20, 21, 22) used the same name for a Paris Basin shell.
Cossman has referred Deshayes' shell to the genus Homotoma (Bellardi, 1875) and has also referred other specimens to this genus which in general resemble Lea's and Heilprin's figures of nana Lea, and insignifiea Heilp.
At any rate the generic affinities of nana Lea, and nana Deshayes are too close to allow the retention of Lea's name; accordingly Heilprin's name, insignifiea, must be adopted.
Lea's and Heilprin's characterization of this form being very imperfect, the following is offered: — Size and general form as shown by the figure; whorls 8-10 ; 1,2, 3 smooth, 4-8 with (a) a subsutural line, (b) a broad, faintly marked concave zone, (c) a strong carinal stria and just above it sometimes a faint line, (d) a strong subcarinal revolving line; body whorl with the subsutural line or band ; the concave zone marked by curving longitudinal striae and faint spirals; carinal angle 110°; subcarinal space with about twenty-five revolving lines somewhat alternating in size; labrum within sometimes with one or two blunt, tooth-like elevations located back some distance from the margin.

Gabb cites his C. texana from " Wheelock, Tex."
His specimen was evidently small and badly preserved.
Normally there are six whorls.
The columella is considerably recurved, but this is a feature that could not be determined from a specimen lacking its anterior canal as did Gabb's type.
The ornamentation of the spiral whorls consists of revolving lines, more distinct above, and more or less regular and apparent longitudinal plaits.
Below the suture there is a slight constriction.

Specific characterization.
— General form as figured ; whorls 8 or 9; 1, 2, 3 smooth and polished, 4 sub-biangulate, 5, 6 with one spiral line just below the suture and two or three more near the base of each whorl where they are crossed by sharp, fine, costaa, 7 evenly striate spirally showing more or less distinct costae and curving lines of growth; body whorl evenly striate, bicarinate, with faint indications of tubercles on each carina, lines of growth with a retral curve above the upper carina resembling those of Surcula; labrum strongly striate within.
Below the tw T o prominent carime there is a third faint one.
Large old specimens sometimes show on the body whorl one very strong carina above, while the two lower are rudimentary.
Fragments have been obtained which would indicate a total length of an entire specimen of at least three inches.
The generic name Levifusus, as far as the writer is aware, has never been characterized ; yet since Conrad has referred to it the species formerly described as Fusua trabeatus and Busyeonf blakei, its characters must be fairly familiar to every worker in Tertiary paleontology.
They may be summed up as follows: — Shell of Fulgurate aspect and affinities (not Fusoid as the name unfortunately indicates) ; with three carina?
on the body whorl, the uppermost strongest and generally spinose, the 6econd less distinct and less frequently spinose, the third or lowest generally faint and obtuse and with no signs of tubercles or spines.
Besides the two species referred to this genus by Conrad, the writer has added two more, viz., Levifusus branneri, originally described from the White Bluff horizon of Arkansas, and L. trabeatoides.
At Wood's Bluff, Ala., there is a form of Levifusus with characters intermediate between L. trabeatus and L. trabeatoides and it is doubtless the ancestral type of both.
This prototype may then be regarded as having produced the true L. trabeatus in Alabama, while in Texas the L. trabeatoides was developed.
L. blakei is somewhat more tuberculate on its uppermost carina than L. trabeatus or L. trabeatoides but is not so strongly marked as L. branneri; the lastmentioned species the writer has recently found in typical Jackson Eocene deposits at Moody's Branch, Jackson, Miss.

Specific characterization.
— General form as indicated by the figure ; whorls (in a mature specimen) at least 6 ; apex obtuse; whorls 1, 2 smooth; 3 spirally striate in part, and in part striate and costate; 4 and 5 with spiral raised lines alternating in size, and with longitudinal folds or costse, the latter occasionally becoming varicose; body whorl marked by four spiral lines on the humeral region, below by three series of spiral lines, and by about twenty rather irregular longitudinal costse ; outer margin of the labrum sharp, within thickened and with rather irregular crenules; columella generally smooth; but sometimes with two irregular swellings just below the point of greatest curvature.
This is a very strange form.
The apex is very obtuse and the nuclear whorls as a whole are generally deflected somewhat from the axis of the adult shell.
So far the species is a true Pyrula.
Moreover the striation is that of Pyrula, but the costation is more irregular than in any of the known species of that genus; in fact it varies from moderately fine Pyrulalike lines to strong varices.
The swellings on the columella, though in no wise true plaits, are worthy of note.
They are evidently of the same origin and nature as those in Mazzalina.

Specific characterization.

Besides the ornamentation shown on the specimen figured, there are usually about four spiral stria?
on each whorl between the upper carinal and subsutural line ; between the two strong carinal lines there is often a faint stria; likewise one often appears just below the lower carina, When fully striated this species bears a general resemblance to T. arenicola and T. arenicola var.
branneri, but may be distinguished at once by the persistency of the bicarinate feature of the whorls to the very apex.
The apical whorls of T. arenicola and variety are unicarinate somewhat as in T. carinata H. C. Lea (T. apita De Greg.).

— Size and general form as indicated by the figure ; whorls -M ; spire very low, marked only by the suture and a fine line just above it; body whorl depressed, somewhat carinate, marked on the periphery by three raised lines, and near the umbilicus by radiating lines of growth.
Locality.
— Smithville, Bastrop Co. , Tex.
Geological horizon.
— Lower Claiborne Eocene.
Type.
— Texas State Museum.
Genus AMAUROPSIS.
Amauropsis singleyi nov. sp.
PI.
9, fig.
12.
Specific characterization.
— General form and size as indicated by the figure; spire pointed and high; whorls 7; body and penultimate whorls shouldered above as in N. recurva; umbilicus small, partially hidden by the labium ; margin of the aperture sharp, reflected.
This species might be mistaken for the young of recurva were it not for the fact that the two have differently formed umbilici.
In recurva there is a ridge formed by the continuation of the lower margin of the aperture that, after passing below and to the left of the umbilicus, winds up into the same as described by Aldrich.
In singleyi the lower margin of the aperture stands out sharply.
If traced upward and inward it will be found to follow the labium about one-third way across the umbilicus and then to wind up into the same.
Locality.
— Cedar Creek , Lee Co. , Tex.
Geological horizon.
— Lower Claiborne Eocene.
Type.
— Collection of J.
A. Singley.

Specific characterization.
— Size and general form as indicated by the figure; whorls 4; spiral, smooth, and shining; body whorl nearly smooth but showing a slight tendency to bear furrows or lines radiating from the suture; umbilicus small; mouth round.
The umbilical portion of this shell appears to be more or less whitened or enameled.
Locality.
— Jones' farm, Hurricane Bayou, Houston Co. ; from Lee County and Mosley's Ferry, Brazos River, (Aldrich's collection ) .
Geological horizon.
— Lower Claiborne Eocene.

PI.
9, fig.
14.
Specific characterization.
— Size and general form as indicated by the figure; whorls 4; 1 minute, nonprotruding; 2, 3 rather small and tumid, marked by a few radiating lines which extend from the suture downward about two-thirds across the whorls, reminding one somewhat of the upper surface of Solarium bellastriatum ; body whorl rather large, rounded, slightly flattened above, with indistinct radial lines or lines of growth, flattened slightly below, rugose near the umbilicus; umbilicus small, Solarium-like, rendered somewhat hexagonal by the protruding peripheral dentes; mouth round; shell rather thick; general appearance like Dillwynella naticoides.
Locality.
— Elm Creek, Lee Co., Tex.
Geological horizon.
— Lower Claiborne Eocene.
