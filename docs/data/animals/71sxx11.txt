MOLLUSCA FROM CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICO.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY.
Most of the forms described herein were collected by Mr. A.
A. Hinkley during two visits to Guatemala.
A few are added from various other localities, collected by Mr. S. N. Rhoads and others.
With the exception of Neritilia, a peculiar Neritid mollusk with a more specialized radula than others of its family, the species belong to genera already well represented in Mexico and Central America.
Salasiella hinkleyi n. sp.
Fig.
2.
The shell is cylindric with tapering spire, glossy, finely, arcuately striate, with numerous irregularly spaced grooves indicating former peristomes.
First three whorls rather slowly widening, after which the suture descends more rapidly, oblique to the previous whorls, each succeeding whorl at least double the width of that above it.
The last whorl is flattened laterally.
Aperture half the length of the shell.
Outer lip arching very strongly forward in the middle.
Columella very deeply concave above the truncation.
Length 8.5, diam.
3 mm.
; 5^ whorls.
Mountain side near the Tamosopo Sugar Company's place, San Luis Potosi.
Also at El Abra.
This species changes so much with age that without a good series one would not readily connect the half-grown and the mature stages.
After the third whorl the suture descends very rapidly, and the aperture becomes shorter in comparison with the total length.
Moreover, the deep, arcuate grooves which characterize the fully adult shell are far weaker and less numerous in specimens of 6 mm.
length or smaller.
It is closely related to S. joaquinoe Strebel, but adult specimens of the same length have a half whorl more and a shorter aperture.
Probably the specimens from Diente, near Monterey, Nuevo Leon, referred to joaquince are immature S. hi7iJdeyi.
16 specimens were taken at El Abra, the largest measuring, length 6, diam.
2 mm.
The aperture is decidedly over half the total length at this stage.
It is quite possible that the largest shell from the type locality (fig.
2) is an exceptionally large and old individual.

213 A review of the species of Salasiella known up to 1907 was given in the Manual of Conchology XIX, pp.
170-174.
Since that time S. hrowni Pils., of the Canal Zone, has been described.

Spiraxis livingstonensis n. sp.
PI.
XI, fig.
1.
The shell is subulate, its diameter contained 3.7 times in the length, very pale yellow, composed of 91 rather strongly convex whorls.
First 2| whorls are smooth, following whorls sculptured with axial (vertical) ribs less than half as wide as their intervals, about 44 on the penultimate whorl.
The upper ends of the ribs project, crenulating the suture.
Aperture ovate; columella a little thickened, moderately sigmoid.
Length 9.25, diam.

This species is related to S. stdciferus, but it has less crowded, thinner ribs.
Spiraxis longior n. sp.
PI.
XI, fig.
2.
The shell is subulate, very slender, the diameter contained about 3.8 times in the length, composed of 9| moderately convex whorls, of which the first 2^ are smooth; apex obtuse; subsequent whorls sculptured with axial (vertical) ribs, which are just perceptibly sinuous, almost straight, and nearly as wide as their intervals.
There are about 35 ribs on the penultimate whorl.
On the last third of the last whorl the ribs become a little weaker in fully adult shells.
Aperture ovate.
Columella thin, weakly sinuous.

Pseudosubulina martensiana n. sp.
PI.
XI, fig.
3.
The shell is slender, a little attenuated near the obtuse apex, corneous-buff, composed of 9 whorls, the first three strongly convex, the convexity diminishing subsequently, the later wiiorls being flattened, convex only near the sutures.
The initial f whorl projects and is smooth; the next two whorls are of about equal diameter, with sculpture of widely spaced axial ribs; on subsequent whorls the ribs are close, rounded, and as wide as their intervals, 40 standing on the penultimate whorl.
On the last whorl the ribs disappear on the base, which is smooth.
Apertures rhombic; columella moderately concave, deeply excised at the base.
Length 11, diam.

Mountains west of Livingston, Guatemala (A.
A. Hinkley).
In the related P. lirifera Morel, the columella is represented as deeply concave, and there are more smooth whorls at the summit.
Whether the shell described and figured as P. lirifera by Professor von Martens is really the species of Morelet is not quite certain.
Guppya elegantula n. sp.
Pig.
4.
The shell is narrowly perforate, pyramidal, resembling G. elegans (Strebel) in form; pale cinnamon, fading at the summit.
Surface above the periphery having a microscopic sculpture of fine, close, nearly vertical striae, cut by equally close spiral lines, but the latter are not everywhere developed; the base glossy,, with engraved spirals only, far, more widely spaced than on the upper surface.
Outlines of the spire are slightly convex.
Whorls quite convex, the last rounded peripherally in the adult stage (angular in the young).
Aperture semilunar, not very wide.

Nuevo Leon, Diente near Monterey (S. N. Rhoads).
Tamaulipas, in a canyon 4 miles w^est of Victoria, at about 3000 ft. (S. N.
Rhoads.)
This is the species which was formerly identified as G. elegans (Strebel) by the writer.
It is nearer that than to any other described species of the region, but on account of the smaller size, in some hundreds of specimens, the identification was not satisfactory.
Specimens of the real elegans have now^ turned up, found in a vial labelled H. selenkai, from Mirador, one of the localities given by Strebel for elegans.
It is a decidedly larger shell than the present species, probably confined to a warmer zone.
Specimens from Uruapam and other places in the State of Michoacan (S. N. Rhoads, 1899), have closer spirals on the base.
A single immature specimen from Yautepec, Moreles (Heilprin exped.)
probably belongs here.
It was recorded by the writer as elegans.
G. elegantula was collected at Guadalajara, Jalisco, by McConnell and Crawford, 1909.
It was taken in river drift at Tampico by Mr. Hinkley, but may have floated there from inland.
It appears to be common and widely distributed.
A closely related form having about one whorl less, and with the aperture a little wider, was taken by Mr. Hinkley about old logs in the banana plantation, Maya farm, Quirigua (No.
28 of his 1913 collection).
It is more highly conic than G. pittier'i v.
Marts., and may perhaps be a new species between pittieri and elegantula, or a subspecies of the latter.
Guppya qundlachi (Pfr.)
was taken by Mr. Hinkley at Tampico and near San Dieguito, San Luis Potosi, and at the Maya Farm, Quirigua, Guatemala.

The shell is minute, umbilicate (the umbilicus small, round, about one-ninth the diameter of the shell), light brown, somewhat glossy, very minutely striate, the striae decussated by close, microscopic spirals on the spire.
The spire is somewhat dome-shaped, the outlines convex, summit obtuse.
The whorls are closely coiled, nearly equal, very convex, the last one rounded peripherally and convex below.

The shell is broadly and openly umbilicate, discoidal, the spire sunken a little; between cinnamon and cinnamon-brown, not banded.
Surface dull, very densely and minutely papillose, and sparsely covered with long hairs arranged in oblique lines.
These hairs are about 0.75 mm.

114,836 A. N. S. P. It is related to T. ccecoides (Tate), but differs by the more elevated shape, the altitude exceeding the diameter.
Drymaeus dombeyanus (Pfr.).
In a variety from Guadalajara, Jalisco, the last 2 or 2| whorls are white, the preceding 2 having some indistinct brown spots; lip and interior white; the spire is longer and aperture smaller than in the typical form.
Length 55, length of aperture with peristome 33 mm.
; nearly 7 whorls.
Another variety from the same neighborhood resembles D. dunkeri forreri (Mouss.)
in shape and coloration, but has the coarse sculpture of dornheyanus.
It is streaked copiously with dull purplish brown, with scattered whitish spots on the streaks.
Lip broadly expanded, as in dombeyanus.
This variety may be called D. dombeyanus ornatus.

u 43 a 26 " 27 " Brachypodella subtilis pulchella (Martens).
This shell, which Mr. Hinkley has obtained in large numbers in the mountains west of Livingston, Guatemala, is not a form of B. morini as I formerly supposed.
It is closely related to B. subtilis (Morel.
), from which it differs by the smaller size and decidedly stronger sculpture.
As in B. subtilis, the early whorls are smooth, while in B. morini they are finely striate.
B. subtilis, of which I have an author's specimen, was described from northern Guatemala, and pulchella from Livingston.

There are 26 specimens in the two lots, the largest 14.6 mm.

As I cannot exactly match the form with any of the numerous Central American or Mexican species, it seems best to descrilje it as new, in order to have a name for the particular form of the Canal Zone.

Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico (McConnell and Crawford).
This is very unlike any American species I have seen, not only by its extreme solidity, but also by the very short contour.
The surface is marked by a few growth-lines, but the minute sculpture, if any, and the color, cannot be ascertained until fresh specimens come to hand.
Planorbula obstructa (Morelet).
In a reservoir four miles north of Guatemala City, Mr. Hinkley took a large series of shells agreeing with the small typical form of S. obstructa except in the absence of internal "teeth" in the great majority of specimens, though a few show them.
This form, which may be called mutation anodonta, is analogous to S. dentiens var.
cmmaruni Morel.
It measures 5 to 6 mm.
in diameter and has only 4 whorls.
There are also several other lots in the collection of the Academy, from places between Guatemala and Panama.

A, lateral teeth of one side, with part of the first uncinus.
B, the first uncinus lying flat, the cusps foreshortened.
C, laterals of both sides with four uncini; 1, 2, 3, first, second and third or major laterals.
220 [Dec, The operculum is unlike that of any known Neritid snail, but the chief peculiarity of the genus is in the radula.
There is no central tooth whatever, the arrangement being as figured by Fischer for Nento'psis, the formula being oo -3-0 3oo , that of Neritina and Nerita being oo -4-1-4go .
The large inner lateral tooth is low, of very irregular form, without cusp, and hard to see on account of its low relief.
The second lateral is also low, narrow, without cusp, and interlocking with the larger lateral.
The major lateral {Hut or Schirm'pJatte of German authors) resembles someAvhat that of Neritma reclivata as figured by Troschel.
The uncini are exceedingly numerous.
Only the inner ones are drawn in the figure (fig.
7).
While the shell has some resemblance to that of Lepyrium, the operculum and radula are very different, and strikingly unlike Neritina (or Theodoxus).
Neritilia succinea guatemalensis subsp.

The shell is Neritiform, hemispherical, solid, buff, the spire projecting very slightly.
Embryonic shell very small, glossy; subsequent whorls not quite 2, rather dull, and smooth except for faint growth lines and on the latter part some impressed lines.
The aperture is semi-circular, yellowish and smooth within, the lip sharp.

A species related to D. striata L., from which it differs by being smaller, comparatively longer, the alt.
being three-fifths of the length; the angle between the anterior dorsal border and the posterior keel is decidedly and constantly larger; the anterior end is longer and tapers rapidly.
The beaks are at the posterior fourtenths of the length.
The keel is not so strongly expressed as in D. striata, and the posterior area is much more convex.
The surface is shining, sculptured about as in D. striata.
There are many radial riblets on the posterior end and extending on the valve about to the middle, whence they diminish gradually to the anterior end.
The anterior-dorsal slope is almost smooth.
The riblets crenulate the basal edge near the posterior angle, but less strongly than in D. striata.
The teeth resemble those of D. striata except that the laterals are lower and much less robust.
The color is variable: white throughout; pink with concentric zones of a deeper shade, the interior pink, often violet at the ends; yellow, the interior white or pink and white, with violet ends; or yellow with dull bluish zones and beaks, the interior deep violet.

45178 A. N. S. P. This species was collected in considerable quantity by Mr. Hinkley; but although locally common, and belonging to a group in which species usually have a wide distribution, I have been unable to trace this shell in the literature.
It is certainly distinct from D. striata, the common Donax of the Mosquito Coast.
It resembles Roemer's figures of his D. siliqua, from an unknown locality, but in that species the beaks are more posterior (at the posterior fourth) , and the posterior carina is therefore steeper; the posterior area is somewhat granulose and its outline more convex.
Moreover, the teeth differ.
None of the new forms in Bertin's monograph (Nouv.
Arch, du Mus.)
is nearly related.
Note.
â€” Since this article was in type I have found that Schepman, in his Prosobranchia of the Siboga Expedition, Part I, 1908, p. 13, has already noticed the peculiarities of Neritilia, and figured the teeth of N .
riihida, from Celebes.
It is interesting to find American species with a similar radula.

10 SCROPHULARIACEiE OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES BY FRANCIS W. PENNELL.
The present revision of the species of the Scrophulariacese occurring in the southeastern portion of the United States, from North Carohna to Florida and westward to the Mississippi River, is the outgrowth of a long-continued and especial interest.
Nearly fifteen years ago, when the Avriter was a student in the Botanical Section of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, certain problems in this field appeared, and have waited for the solutions now proposed.
Perhaps this early connection will make more fitting the appearance of this paper in these Proceedings.
During the late summers and early autumns of 1912 and 1913, I collected extensively through every state of this area.
This was in pursuit of a monographic study of the genera now called Macranthera, Dasistoma, Afzelia, Aureolaria, Agalinis and Otophylla.
Nearly every species was found, and descriptions made of the form and color of the corolla of each.
Later, almost every herbarium of significance for these species has been reviewed, and the results are presented with some confidence.
A preliminary paper, dealing with the species of the Coastal Plain, was published in the "Torrey Bulletin" in 1913, and a summary of this group for North America is now awaiting publication in the Contributions from the Botanical Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania.
In the course of these two trips many collections were made of the nearly related Buchnera, and, less consistently, attention was given to other genera of the family.
But, to obtain field-descriptions and to collect for the first time the spring-flowering species, another trip was necessary.
In the Spring of 1917 I traveled as far south as Key West, and from the Coast into the Appalachians.
The expedition was peculiarly successful, so that now, excepting for a few local species of the lowland, as Herpestis rotundifolia and several oi Agalinis, or of the upland, as Ilysanthes saxicola and Pe?istemon snialUi, or of the mountains in late summer, as Chelone lyoni, practically every species has been described from flowering plants.
Excluding Agalinis and its allies, specimens preserved in eastern herbaria only have been reviewed.
I have studied all in the herbaria of The New York Botanical Garden, the Brooklj^n Botanic Garden, The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Universit}' of Pennsylvania, the United States National Museum, (including the former Biltmore Herbarium), and the Charleston IMuseum.
In all institutions I have received the kindest attention and assistance.
The present revision follows a plan which should lead to a simple and helpful presentation of our taxonomic knowledge of this family within the area considered.
Keys are given throughout, and these are made so ample as to include all features of evident contrast noted.
Effort is made to group species and genera according to real relationship, hence giving the keys a phylogenetic value.
To accomplish this, and to show what appears to have been the evolutionary progress within this family, a rearrangement of the whole has been made.
This was first attempted in my " Scrophulariacese of the Local Flora, ""^ but the placing of the Gratiolese as introductory to the genuine Scrophulariacese now appears to me more satisfactory.
While of theoretic suggestiveness, it is hoped that these keys may prove of practical service.
Synonomy is given, so far as to explain the origin and application of each specific and varietal name used, and to account for every such name ever proposed from within this area.
The original statement as to the type or to typic distribution is quoted, and consequent discussion is given.
Practically all typic or isotypic^ material known to occur in this country has been verified, and in Agalinis and allies much of that abroad.
Especially rich in types are the herbaria of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, where Nuttall's and de Schweinitz's plants are preserved, and of the Charleston Museum, containing Elliott's collection.
The statements of distribution, variability, season of flowering and of fruiting, corolla-color, and other comment scarcely need explanation.
For Agalinis and allies, which I have collected repeatedly and over a wide range, my forthcoming monograph will give a more detailed analysis of the range of each species.
At present for all species I am stating range in general terms, and shall trust to receive corrections from workers who find this treatment partial or erroneous.
The detailed noting of corolla-color will be of interest to students in the field.

This is of the collection-numbers of the specimens made by me, grouping these by states.
While not attempting to list collections, because of spacelimitation, it does seem advisable to present this series, showing specimens considered authentic.
For Agalinis and allies my forthcoming monograph will state fully the herbaria in which each may be consulted; for these and for the other genera, the numbers between 4,000 and 6,000 may be seen in the herbarium of the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia and numbers between 9,000 and 10,000 in that of the New York Botanical Garden.

Flowering and fruiting probably throughout the year, although all specimens seen were collected between November and June.
Corolla white or violet-tinged and slightly spotted with violet within throat.
Normally the five stamens are fertile, but any, and as many as four, may become rudimentary.
Examination of fresh flowers shows that both in Capraria and Scoparia the posterior lobes of the corolla are external in the bud, thus confirming the impression gained from distribution and the nature of the glands in the leaves of the latter, that these genera belong to the Gratioleae.

Bosc collected in Carolina, and his plant, as shown from the parts described, is certainly the species now considered.
While Gaertner was doubtless influenced in his selection of a name by Michaux' Monniera rotundifolia, 1803, Bosc's plant is stated to be only perhaps this.
Moreover Michaux' name is not connected with the phrase "Herpestis rotundifolia," so that we must consider this combination as here originating for the plant of Bosc.
This has been confused with Gratiola repens Sw., a species of Ranapalus.
In shallow water, muddy shores, within the Coastal Plain, Maryland to Florida.
Also in the West Indies.
Very few collections are known, and in our area only the following stations have been noted : Wilmington, North Carolina; Ogeechee, Georgia; Jacksonville and Eustis, Florida.

"Growing in water in very shallow depressions in granite rock," Stone Mountain and nearby granite hills of Dekalb and Newton counties, central Georgia.

Not seen growing.
Apparently this plant only flourishes during wet seasons.
On April 25, 1917, I searched most carefully for it on the summit and slopes of Stone Mountain (Canbj^'s record of May 15, 1869, specifies "the summit"), but found no trace whatever.
The season had been dry and there were no pools.
A remarkable plant with a unique dimorphic habit.
It should be carefully studied living in order to assist in discovering its real relationship.
Certainly aberrant in Gratiolece, it may possibly belong to the Vej-onicece, as is suggested by the fruit.
This was long ago the thought of Dr. Leavenworth as shown by his notes preserved in the herbarium of Columbia University.

The name of Nuttall was a nomen nudum, and Nuttall (Gen. Am.
1: 9.
1818) says, perhaps due to a typographic slip, "from the hills of New Hampshire."
But that the name monticola was in use before the date of Sprengel's publication is proven by the existence of old specimens labeled "Lindernia monticola" collected by Schweinitz probably in North Carolina.
Such a specimen, in the herbarium of Columbia University at the New York Botanical Garden, is probably an isotype of T. monticola, and is Ilysanthes refracta.
