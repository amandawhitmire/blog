MOLLUSCA OF THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES I Uroooptidae  Helicidse of Arizona and New Mexico.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY.
In these papers the molhisks collected by Mr. James H. Ferriss and the writer in the expedition made in 1903 and ly Mr. Ferriss in two visits to Arizona in 1902 and 1904 will be discussed.
The present contribution deals chiefly with Mr. Ferriss' researches in Arizona where an extraordinarily rich and varied snail fauna was found in the canyons of the Chiricahua and Huachuca Mountains.
In the study of these materials I have worked over many specimens received from the late E. H. Ashmun who first made known to us the richness of the Arizona snail fauna and from Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell whose unceasing labors on the fauna and flora of New Mexico are familiar to all naturalists.
The treatment of the genus Ashmunella has been made practically monographic.
It is unfortunate that no good topographic survey of southern Arizona has been published.
It is extremely difficult at present to determine some localities given by previous naturalists or to clearly indicate the positions of those explored by Mr. Ferriss.
The accompanying sketch of the canyons explored in the Huachucas makes no pretensions to cartographic accuracy beyond showing the relative positions of the localities mentioned in the text.
From Fort Huachuca to Ramsey Canyon is 10 miles to Carr Canyon 14 and to Miller Canyon 20 miles.
Manilla mine is 6 miles from Fort Huachuca.
The range is about 30 miles long and 6 wide.
Of the Chiricahuas it may suffice to say that Bar or Bearfoot Park 's on the summit and is believed to lie at 8500 feet elevation.
There was a sawmill there in 1904.
From it toward the southwest Sawmill Canyon leads and Cave creek flows down from the opposite side.
This must not be confused with Cave Creek Canyon in the Huachucas.
Fly Park the type locality of Ashmunella chiricahuana is on the same mountain farther south about two
miles.
Cave creek is 30 miles from NineMile Canyon and 20 miles from Fort Bowie.
Mr. Ferriss has given notes on the general conditions of collecting and on the country in the Nautilus for September 1904.
Some considerations of general interest to evolutionists are touched 212 Mch. upon in the discussion of the composite nature of snail colonies p. 226 since the conclusions reached from molluscan studies apply equally to communities of other comparatively sedentary animals.
Throughout the preparation of this paper I have had the coopcraN M' J    'I '' 'hii.

I would also gratefully acknowledge assistance lent by Dr. Wm.
H. Dall in the comparison of various species of Holospira etc. with those described by him.
The figures of shells were photographed and those of soft anatomy drawn by the author.
Family UROCOPTIDuE Pils.
This family is represented in the Southwest by members of two very distinct subfamihes Eucalodiixe with the genus Holospira and MiCROCERAMiN.E with thc genus Microceramus.
Holospira is an old genus containing several highly specialized phyla.
Our species fall into five groups as indicated below.
The subgenera were formerly defined by the internal lamellae alone  but these are in some cases of less significance than the general form and sculpture A.
 Last whorl distorted its last half turning sinistrally.
I.
 Internal column rather large smooth throughout last whorl sinuous turning sinistrally.
Aperture oblong with a strong fold within the right margin and a vertical columellar callous in the throat.
Metastoma Strebel.
One species H. roemeri.
B.
 Last half of the last whorl straightened normal.
II.
 Internal column small smooth and simple throughout or with a small axial lamella in the last whorl  very slender below slightly wider above.
Shell rather large 19 to 29 mm.
long the individual whorls comparatively high the last one or two more coarsely sculptured than the intermediate ones.
Number of whorls much less than the number of millimeters in the length of the shell.
Haplocion Pils.
Species H. pasonis Dall H. hamiltoni Dall.
III.
 Penultimate whorl with a short stout lamella on the axis and a weaker one on the basal wall.
Number of whorls decidedly less than the number of millimeters in the shell's length.
Distomospira Dall.
Species H. bilamellata Dall.
IV.
 Internal column moderate onefourth to onesixth the diameter of shell.
Shell 9 to 18 mm.
long in known species compactly coiled ribbed or striated the whorls short their number about equal to the number of millimeters in the length of the shell or exceeding that number.
A short axial lamella is present within the penult whorl and sometimes short basal or parietal lamellae.
Bostrichocentrum Strebel.
Type H. iryoni.
V.  Cavity of the penultimate whorl obstructed bj' four strong lamellae axial basal parietal and palatal.
Holospira s. sir.
Species H. goldfussi Mke.
In addition to the species noticed below the following species of Holospira are known from north of the Mexican boundary H. Bostrichocentrum pilsbryi Dall rather doubtfully recorded from New Mexico or Arizona without definite locality and known to inhabit the Mexican state Puebla.
H. Distomospira hilomellata Dall from the top of Hacheta Grande Mountain Grant county New Mexico.
H. Haplocion pasonis Dall from Mule Canyon El Paso county Texas.
H. Haplocion hamiltoni Dall from Rio Grande Mountains Brewster county Texas at an elevation of 3500 feet living on Selaginella lepidophylla a common and conspicuous moss of western Texas.

I jke H. rocmeri this species belongs to the hill country bordering the Lower Cretaceous area in Texas.
Mr. Ferriss and the writer found it above San Marcos Hays county Texas  in the flooddebris of Sinking Spring and on ledges of its bordering limestone cliff.
This is farther northeast than the species has hitherto been found for I have no doubt that the locality Dallas cited by Strebel is an error.
It is abundant under stones at the foot of the cliffs along the Guadalupe river about six miles above New BraunInternal structure of H. fj Qqj pountv.

The specimens figured are from the Guadalupe.
New Braunfels is probably the type locality.
At the Hondo river two miles north of Hondo Medina county in the driftdebris we also found H. goldfussi.
This is the extreme western range of the species as far as we know.
It did not occur in the Devil's river region on the Pecos or westward.
Subgenus BOSTRICHOCENTRUM Strebel.
All of the species have a small short lamella on the axis in the last part of the penultimate whorl sometimes almost obsolete and some of them have a very weak basal or parietal lamella or both.
These lamellae are always very much smaller and lower down than those of typical Holospira goldfussi etc..
The variations are as follows  1905.

The shell is rimate but imperforate short and cylindric rather thin and very pale brownishcorneous.
Whorls 9 to 11 the first whorl wider than the second both of them smooth  all the rest of the whorls are regularly evenly and closely ribstriate the riblets as wide as their intervals or a little narrower except on the last whorl where the sculpture is a little coarser and irregular.
The whorls are all convex the last 4 or 5 forming the cylindric portion the preceding whorls forming the terminal cone which is about onethird the total length of the shell.
The last whorl is pinched or compressed laterally but the very short straight neck is full again and carries the aperture very shortly free.
The aperture is rounded but a little irregular the upper margin being somewhat straightened.
The thin peristome is narrowly expanded.
The internal pillar is rather large and of ecual calibre in the cylindric portion of the shell.
At the end of the penultimate and beginning of the last whorl there is a short strong and blunt lamella on the pillar below the middle a low short lamella on the parietal wall and another on the basal wall.
There is no palatal lamella.
Length 7.5 to 9 diam.

Manilla mine Huachuca Mountains.
This is a very short thickset species unlike all others known in its internal armature.
The even ribbing and short terminal cone are also characteristic.
It is closely related to H. arizonensis Stearns from Dos Cabezas a place west of the Chiricahua range and not far from one of the localities of H. ferrissi but besides the slight difference in internal structure H. arizonensis differs in being slightly larger with more whorls and the riblets are subobsolete on the cylindric portion of the shell while in H. ferrissi they are even stronger there than on the terminal cone.
This species occurred also at Fort Bowie Arizona where the shells average a trifle larger  Length 7.5 diam.

This species is about the size of H. chiricahuana  which however differs in the less projecting last whorl contracted behind the lip and in the smaller differently shaped mouth.
The more closely related H. mearnsi is larger with more whorls but it is not unlikely that specimens intermediate in these respects will be found.
Several broken shells of H. regis indicate dimensions smaller than those of the type.

B. Metcalfe sent by Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell.
H. cockerelli differs from the related H. regis and H. mearnsi chiefly by the smoothness of the intermediate whorls.
It is not improbable that the original specimen found in the flooddebris of the Rio Grande was washed down from the region around Kingston as Prof. Cockerell suggests to me.

This peculiar snail Inhabits the hilly border of the 1000 foot elevation which roughly defines the southeastern limit of the Lower Cretaceous area in Texas It has not been observed northeast of New Braunfels.
Thence it has been traced westward in Medina county and near the Rio Grande at Devil's river and the Pecos.
We know nothino of its distribution northward upon the ''Edwards Plateau since only its lower scarps have been explored.
Westward we have it from El Paso where Ferriss got specimens on Franklin Mountain in 1902 and in New Mexico Rehn and Viereck found it in Alamo Canyon near Alamogorda Otero county in the eastern range of the Cordillera.

Thysanophora is represented by two species noticed below.
The only Polygyra yet reported from New Mexico or Arizona is Polygyra triodontoides Bid. which has been reported from South Spring creek near Roswell in the Pecos Valley New Mexico Nautilus XIII p. 84 but the specimens now in my possession proved to be a form of P. texasiana near P. t. texasensis.

All known species are from the mountains of New Mexico and southeastern Arizona.
Only two of the 15 species and 10 subspecies now known had been recognized prior to 1895 and but one of these was published at the time the last treatise on American land snails was issued Binney's Manual of American Land Shells 1885.
The literature of the group is scattered through many volumes of several periodicals and a large majority of the species have not been figured.
In making substantial additions to the group it seems timely to review and systematize the data accumulated.
The soft anatomy has proved to conform closely to the generic characters originally set forth.
Ten species and varieties have now been dissected by myself and one additional by Mr. Murdoch none of them diverging in any important respect.
The proportions of the organs vary in the several forms showing specific variation and affording valuable cliies to the affinities of the species.
To utilize these data it is necessary to give the measurements of the organs readily obtained by pulling them out straight.'
The measurements of the genitalia of ten species of Ashmunella follow   The comparative lengths of the organs are not materially altered by different degrees of contraction owing to different methods of preservation  and even the absolute dimensions are less affected than might be supposed.
All but one of the dissections noticed herein were made from drowned specimens preserved in alcohol with but little contraction.

d The jaw and teeth of Ashmunella do not differ from those organs in Sonorella.
The jaw is ribbed the ribs variable and irregular as is often the case in the Californian Helices.
It is less strong and the ribs are less convex than usual in the jaw of Polygyra.
The radula has from 24.1.24 to about 30.1.30 teeth.
There are 9 to 12 lateral teeth.
In nine of the ten species examined both mesocone and ectocone are bifid on part of the marginal teeth.
In A. duplicidens and A. chiricahuana the ectocone is usually simple but on occasional outer marginals of the latter they are bifid as in the other species.
The number of teeth reckoned as laterals varies somewhat on different parts of the same radula as I have observed in several species so that the importance of variations from the counts of teeth given in the text must not be overestimated.
Except in the case of A. chiricahuana all of my preparations of genitalia jaws and radulse are from specimens of the type lots.
From the data now in hand it seems in a high degree likely that the ancestral stock of all known Ashmunellas had a tridentate aperture.
There was a tendency to split the basal tooth perhaps not expressed in the original stock but subsequently developed orthogenetically in most of the subgroups.
This tendency culminates in the levettei group where the original basal tooth has been divided into two distinct and often widely separated teeth.
There has also been degeneration of the apertureteeth parallel in various stocks and culminating in several toothless forms astonishingly alike though of undoubtedly diverse parentage.
A. hyporhyssa Ckll. robusta Pils. chiricahuana Dall esuritor Pils. etc. are convergent forms of this character.
The true relationships of such simplified species must be demonstrated by their internal anatomy.
The idea that the toothless forms are primitive can hardly be entertained in view of their anatomical diversity and their demonstrable relation to several groups of toothed species the evidently homologous teeth of wnich on this hypothesis would have been independently evolved.
This would be homoplasy on too extensive a scale to be readily believed.
The apertureteeth in Ashmunella curiously imitate those of Polygyra a genus not in the least related.
In Europe Isognomostoma and Helicodonta have evolved similar forms in still other phyla.
There has been a tendency to overload Ashmunella with subspecific names which would logically end in naming every colony in existence.
I do not minimize the importance of noting and recording local diiTerentiation.
My appreciation of its omnipresence convinces me that it cannot all be stereotyped in nomenclature and if it were the result would be too unwieldy for any human intellect to make use of.
15 The range of individual variation in Ashmtinella among specimens from one place is with the exception of A. I. heterodonta not greater than in Polygyra.
Among specimens I have measured or examined I have seen no lot which would yield a markedly bimodal curve were the variations plotted.
The variations between different colonies or gens are often appreciable sometimes conspicuous but here also the ase may readily be paralleled in Polygyra although usually not in such restricted areas for the reason that in the Polygyra country the topographic and climatic features are less emphatic and the lifezones are not crowded upon one another as in the land of the Ashmunellas but are spread over larger areas.
The conception of species in such sedentary animals as snails is far from simple.
A species comprises a multitude of colonies or communities which at any one time are isolated one from the other by the existing topographic and other surface features of the country.
This is and always has been the case even with the common widespread forms of the more level parts of the country but the colonies there have always been subject to frequent mixture with their neighboring colonies by the ever slightly fluctuating conditions of woodland and local moisture so that their network over the country has been here and there made practically complete within comparatively short periods.
As a consequence we have in many cases no tangible difference between individuals from colonies hinidreds of miles apart.
In regions where the local physical features are more accentuated the colonies or communities are often less subject to mixtiue. Moreover the range of conditions within a limited area is far greater.
Thus snails of the same original stock living in the rocky talus on opposite sides of a canyon are often subject to very diverse conditions of heat moisture and consequently cryptogamic food.
They are often wholly unable to cross from one side to the other by reason of a wide freshetswept or arid space.
Moreover subsequent changes such as the formation of lateral canyons and the localization of suitable stations in the talus tend to further isolate the several colonies and to preserve their individuality for long periods.
Thus each colony follows its own bent and differentiation ensues cither by the cmnulation of organic changes induced by varying conditions of growth and nutrition determined by the local enviromncnt as mentioned above or by the occurrence of diverse mutations  in the several colonies or by both causes.
My idea of the practical isolation of snail colonies is based upon the experience of many years.
Similar views have been expressed by Hemphill in the 1905.
227 account of his collecting in Utah and by Ferriss who in speaking of the Huachiicas says Every colony in the canyon was liable to have some distinctive mark in size color or form No two colonies seemed exactly alike and they did not visit back and forth nor travel far from the best part of their own rock pile Nautilus XVIII p. 51.
When through some means two slightly differentiated colonies intermingle as they occasionally must hybridism follows and a complex progeny issues such as I have found in the Floridian Liguus.
WTio can unravel the tangled threads of affinity when the modified forms of two or more canyons reach each other across a divide 
It is as complex as a modern human commimity where subraces are mingling blood after centuries of pure breeding.
Growp of A. rhyssa.
In species of this group small basal and parietal teeth are often present but there is no outer lip tooth.
The spermatheca and its duct are about half the length of the penis epiphallus and flagellum or even less.
The combined length of the penis epiphallus and flagellum is decidedly less than three times the diameter of the shell.
The penis is comparatively well developed.
This group is especially characteristic of the Capitan White and Sacramento ranges of southerncentral New Mexico east of the Rio Grande.
The forms now known arrange themselves in three series thus  robusta ashmuni capitanensis hyporhyssa altissima pseudodonta miorhyssarhyssatownsendi The central and righthand groups are known to be related by the genitalia.
The group on the left is separated from these geographically and its relationships must remain wholly uncertain until the soft parts can be examined.

This is the senior name for a member of the group of closely related forms inhabiting the Sierra Blanca and adjoining Sacramento Mountains in middlesouthern New Mexico.
The shell is more globose than any other known Ashmunella having about the proportions of the large Eastern Mesodons.
It is dull and roughly sculptured on the last whorl with coarse curved irregular wrinkles between and over which fine incised spirals may be traced.
The rather small aperture is contracted by a wide heavy lip the outer margin of which is indistinctly thickened within.
There is a low indistinct basal tooth or callous and a very small deeply placed oblique parietal tooth sometimes absent.
The innbilicus is narrow and deep but slightly enlarging at the last whorl.

The shell is small and depressed of 5 moderately convex whorls the inner ones enlarging slowly the last much wider with the periphery above the middle very obtusel subangular in front elsewhere well rounded.
The only specimens yet found are dead bleached and somewhat worn having lost all of the cuticle.
The embryonic 1 whorls are smooth the first neanic whorl almost equally so.
Then oblique striffi set in which gradually become coarser.
On the last whorl they become strong rounded sigmoid ribs very strong on the last half whorl.
There are traces of fine spiral lines between the ribs.
Behind the lip the whorl is moderately contracted and it descends a trifle to the aperture.
The aperture is very oblique lunate.
The peristome is thickened within and on its convex face narrowly reflexed throughout.
There is a faint hardly noticeable basal prominence but nothing to be called a tooth.
There is no parietal tooth and the callous between the lipends is very thin.

This form has hitherto been referred to A. chiricahuana  from which it differs chiefly in the greater inflation of the latter part of the last whorl.
This is noticeable in a side view and is seen prominently above the aperture in a front view.
It differs from A. pseudodonta capitanensis chiefly by wanting basal teeth.
In such simplified forms as this it is not easy to determine the true relationships by the shell alone.
When the genitalia can be examined the affinities of A. ashmuni and A. a. robusta.
wnll doubtless become clear.

The form from Las Vegas Hot Springs at about 7000 feet elevation called A. t. cooperce offers no tangible difference from Santa Fe thomsoniana.
It is not yet evolved enough to be distinguishable from thomsoniana if the specimens were mixed.
I do not think it desirable or practicable to name forms so very slightly differentiated.
The umbilicus is a trifle more open than typical A. thomsoniana like the Monument Rock shells or a little less open being thus intermediate in size.
The teeth are in the average slightly smaller.

This is a form of ample proportions rich dark chestnut color and glossy surface.
The periphery is rounded or has a mere trace of angulation in front.
The cylindric umbilicus enlarges rapidly at the last whorl.
The spire while compactly convoluted has more rapidly widening whorls than A. I. angigyra.
The spaces between the three lipteeth are about equal.
The parietal lamella has a kink or inward bend at the axial end in the type specimen but this kink is often wanting being a variable character in levettei and allied species.
There are about 6 whorls all convex.
The first 1 are smooth and glossy except for short strise radiating from the suture  on the second whorl these striae extend across the whorl.
The following whorls are very finely irregularly marked with faint growthlines.
On the penultimate and last whorls there is a faint excessively fine and close spiral striation too minute to be visible except witn a compound microscope and a fine malleation in spiral direction or spiral impressed lines readily seen with the hand lens or even the naked eye.
The periphery is rounded.

I have seen no specimens from that place.
Bland originally described levettei as from Santa Fe Canyon New Mexico but the researches there of Ashmun Cockcrell and others have failed to bring it to light.
Indeed no closely related species is known to occur within hundreds of miles of that place whereas some of the Huachuca shells agree perfectly with the type specimen of levettei which I have examined.
Tnere can be little doubt that Dr. Levettc was mistaken in the locality.
It is not known that he collected the shells himself.

809L In Cave Creek Canyon and the tributary Ida Canyon on the southern slope of the east end of the Huachuca range Mr. Ferriss found an extraordinary series of Ashmmellas in which the teeth vary from about as well developed as in A. levettei to completely obsolete as in A. chiricahuana.
No other member of the genus was found in these canyons.
The several stages occur together and the chain of mutations is uninterrupted.
See also Mr. Ferriss' notes on this race Nautilus XVIII p. 51 below middle of page.

.
The colonies of Cave and Ida Canyons are evidently undergoing rapid degeneration of the teeth the parent form having been typical A. levettei such as occurs in the adjacent canyon westward and that over the ridge.
Examples of such degeneration are common enough at any stage of progress but the unique feature about it in this particular colon is that the individuals have been so unequally affected that all stages of the process are present at one time and place.
It does not seem to be a case of hybridism between A. levettei and A. chiricahuana as I at one time suspected.
The results are unlike hybrid colonies in the predominance of intermediate individuals.

This species is closely related by shell characters but not by its soft anatomy to A. levettei angigyra of the Huachuca range agreeing with that form in the close convolution of the whorls the angular periphery and the general arrangement of the teeth.
But all fresh specimens of A. angulata show a quincuncial punctation of some part of the neanic whorls not present in the Huachuca form and the two especially differ in the shape of the whorls the upper surface of which is flattened in angulata convex in angigyra.

At first glance this form seems to be a small angular race of A. chiricahvxina but upon closer study it seems far more likely that it is a terminal member of the A. angulata group in which the teeth have degenerated.
The slight flattening of the whorls the shape of the mouth and a faint punctation observable near the end of the third whorl in the freshest specimens all indicate this relationship.

This species has the general shape and rounded periphery of A. levettei.
It varies from chestnut to rather light greenishbrown and shells which have lost their cuticle are dull fleshcolored.
It is very glossy and smooth marked with weak growthwrinkles and engraved spirals which are distinct in some almost obsolete in other specimens.
Under the compound microscope fine spiral striae are seen to cover the surface between the spiral lines.
Whorls about 5h slightly convex.
The last descends a trifle in front and is somewhat constricted behind the lip.
The aperture is without teeth.
The lip is narrow reflexed brownish above and at the edge without trace of lipteeth.
The umbilicus opens rather widely at the last whorl.
There is almost always an opaque yellow stripe on the last whorl marked inside by a strong white rib and indicating a place of growtharrest.
Some shells have several such variceal streaks on earlier whorls also.
The feature is a variable one in shells of the same lot for reasons I have elsewhere discussed in full.
In one lot of 16 specimens from Cave Creek Canyon Chiricahuas there are 3 specimens with a single streak on last whorl 8 with 2 streaks on last 2 whorls 4 with 3 streaks on last 3 whorls and 1 with 4 streaks on last 3 whorls.

This snail so far as the slieU is concerned would be referred without hesitation to A. chiricahvana the differences being less than the ordinary range of individual variation in Ashmunella or Polygyra but the genitalia are so utterly unlike in the two forms that it is obvious that they are not even nearly related.
From the granulation and the weak traces of teeth it seems that A. metamorphosa is probably a toothless derivative of the A. levettei stock I regret that I have no alcoholic specimens of A. levettei or A. I. heterodonta for comparison.
4.
esuritor differs from metamorphosa by its angular or distinctly subangular periphery rougher siuface when perfectly fresh and perhaps somewhat wider umbilicus but it must be admitted that the two forms are so similar that their distinction may be difficult without an examination of the soft parts.
The genitalia however are so very different that the two species cannot even be closely related.
They must be independent derivatives from toothed ancestral forms.
I dissected two of the three specimens received.
They could be extracted only by breaking into the shell.
Having been preserved in alcohol without drowning the specimens were much more contracted than the A. chiricahuana and A. esuritor I examined.
A somewhat extensive experience with snails in all conditions of preservation has shown that beyond a moderate diminution of the absolute size the characters of the genitalia are not altered by preservation of the animal in strong alcohol.

Coll. Vol.
47 p. 187 1904 monograph.
The soft anatomy of this genus has hitherto been known in a single species.
The study of numerous specimens of several species enables me to extend the generic characterization.
The shells in these Helices while interminably modified locally in size and minor details of shape and sculpture show with few exceptions no prominent specific differentiation.
On the other hand in the internal anatomy there has been a good deal of divergence.
A few forms such as S. lohrii Gabb and S. wolcottiana Bartsch seem to be quite distinct conchologically but in many cases the determination of specimens of the shells other than the type localities is so uncertain as to be little better than guesswork even when types are available for comparison.
In dealing with these ambiguous forms I have thought the interests of science best furthered by applying specific names only to those I am able to characterize anatomically and thus put upon a secure basis.
An illustrated monograph of Sonorella dealing with the shells only has been 'published by Mr. Paul Bartsch who has devoted great industry to the elucidation of the numerous species and races.
The work is of permanent value for its exact descriptions and excellent figures both of which I have had occasion to test but it deals with selected or type specimens only ignoring the fact of variation and hence fails to give a just idea of the complex of varying forms which exist or even of the variations of size etc. occurring in the type lots.
I would here express my indebtedness to Mr. Bartsch for his invariable kindness in comparing for me various forms of S. hachitana with specimens in the U. S. National Museum.
Mr. Bartsch has made the valuable observation that the embryonic shells of Sonorella are sculptured usually with oblique forwardly descending threads or with two sets of intersecting threads sometimes interrupted to form papilloe at their intersections.
This sculptiue may I think be the accelerated vestige of a somewhat similar sculpture characteristic of the Californian Helices in their adult stage and which may thus have been common to the ancestral SonorcUas.
The relationships of Sonorella are primarily with Oreohelix and Ashviunella.
It differs from Oreohelix chiefly in the different proportions of the kidney and pericardium but also in the structure of the shell the oviparous reproduction the unkeeled young shell and in the distinctly ribbed jaw.
Sonorella stands nearer Ashmunella in internal anatomy but there is a constant difference in the male organs the penis being well developed in Sonorella while in Ashmunella it is more or less completely degenerate the epiphallus being hypertrophic.
The divergence between the shells of the two genera is conspicuous.
So far as the shell is concerned Sonorella stands nearer to the generally prevalent type of Belogonous Helices than do either of the other genera.
Generic Characters of Sonorella.
The genitalia PI.
XX show no accessory organs on the female side.
The vagina is long  the spermatheca is globular or ovate on a very long slender branchless duct.
The atrium is always extremely short.
The penis is a welldeveloped thinwalled tube containing a large papilla and terminating in a welldeveloped epiphallus.
There is always a loose sheath or wide collar enveloping the base of the penis and attached by muscular threads to the end of the epiphallus which is thus held loosely in a reflexed position.
This sheath has been removed in most of my figiues as it obscures the parts enveloped.
The retractor muscle is attached to the epiphallus close to the penis and is adnate to or envelops it to the apex of the latter.
The fiagellum is extremely short or even absent.
The details of structure are much vai'ied in the several species as described below under each specific caption and in the table of measurements.
The free muscles pallial complex and digestive tract have been described in these Proceedings for 1900 p. 558.
No material differences have been observed in additional species examined.
The jaw has four to eight ribs grouped in the median part and either strong or weak as in the Californian Helices PI.
XXIII figs.
1823.
The radula has imicuspid middle and lateral teeth iDicuspid transitional and inner marginal teeth and low wide marginals with both cusps bifid.
Exactly the same type of teeth occurs in the Californian Epiphragmophoras in Ashmunella Polygyra etc.
The upper surface of the foot is densely pebblegranose with rather indistinct dorsal grooves the genital furrow is undeveloped except near the mantle.
The tail is depressed rather long and sometimes has a weak median impressed line along the top.
In my original diagnosis of Sonorella I stated that the shell was neither malleate nor spirally striate Mr Bartsch has also asserted that incised spiral lines are never present in this genus.
This statement must now be withdrawn since several forms discovered by Mr. Ferriss show impressed spiral lines but they are inconspicuous and visible only under the lens.
 To the eye the shells of all known Sonorellas appear nearly smooth the sculpture aside from slight growthwrinkles being microscopic.
This is somewhat remarkable because they often live in the same rockpiles with rudely sculptiued Oreohelices.
Mr. Bartsch has excluded Helix carpenteri Newc.
from Sonorella on account of its spiral sculpture but since I have found that this is not a diagnostic character of the genus I am disposed pending an examination of the soft anatomy to adhere to my former opinion that carpenteri belongs to Sonorella.
256 Mch. Up to this time no carinate or even strongly angular species have been found.
Such uniformity in the shell is unusual in a Helicicl genus.
The characters of the soft anatomy originally attributed to the genus have proved to prevail in the more extensive material now examined except that in one species the fiagellum is obsolete.
The penis was incorrectly described in my original diagnosis through my failure to open it and thus ascertain the exact limits of penis and epiphallus.

This is a widely distributed species in central and southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico.
It varies in size degree of depression width of umbilicus size of aperture and in colortone also in some measure in the sculpture  but so multifarious are the connecting links that I do not now see my way to support the dismemberment proposed by Mr. Bartsch.
It will doubtless be found useful to recognize by name a halfdozen or more local races.
The internal anatomy of the types from Hacheta Grande Mountains Grant county.
New Mexico is not known nor have topotypes been dissected.
I have been able however to examine several specimens from other localities which conchologically differ very little from the original lot of hachitana some of which are before me.
The name hachitana seems to be a perverted form of that of the locality Big Hatchet.
The Spanish name locally in use and appearing on most maps is Hacheta Grande.

This radula differs a good deal from that of the Purtyman's ranch form in both count of the teeth and in some details of their shape  but these features are admitted by all who have examined many radulse to vary so widely among individuals that their value is largely discounted.
The discrepancy between the forms should be controlled by the examination of several of each form.

Specimens of this lot have been examined by Mr. Bartsch and pronounced by him to be ''a small race of S. ashmuni.
They bear the same relation to ashmuni that S. mearnsi bears to .S.
dalli.
I would prefer to make an immaterial change in this statement.
I would say that S. ashmuni represents a large race or colony of S. hachitana and the Oak creek lot is nearly typical hachitana.
The specimens are welldeveloped shells often larger than typical hachitana from Hacheta Grande Mountains.
Nearly all are banded whitish above and below the band but 3 out of 350 collected by Mr. Ashmun at this place lack the dark band figs.

In general the aperture in the Purtyman ranch shells averages larger than in tjpical hachitana but no hard and fast line can be drawn and selected individual specimens of each are simply indistinguishable either by measurements color or any other character.
The most we can claim for S'.
ashmuni is the rank of a weakly differentiated local race of S. hachitana chiefly separable in actual practice by its geographic distribution.
The radula has fewer teeth in a transverse row than in the hachitana from the Florida Mountains near Deming New Mexico but only one radula from each locality has Vjeen examined.

The jaw has 6 or 7 narrow unevenly spaced ribs.
The radula has 44.1.44 teeth like those of S'.
granulatissima.
The eleventh and twelfth are transitional.
The last whorl is less deflexed than in S. h. howiensis the aperture is larger and the umbilicus smaller.
Both penis and vagina are decidedly shorter though their proportionate lengths do not differ materially and both have the penispapilla short and obtuse but in S. rowelli the flagellum is reduced to a minute vestige unlike any of the other species.
The remarkable constancy of this organ in the large number of individuals of Sonorella and Ashmunella which have been under my scalpel gives reason for considering its modification in this species of importance.
I have identified these shells with S. rowelli Newc a species said to have been collected in Arizona by Frick many jears ago.
S. arizonensis Dall from Tucson is more elevated but is probably related to rowelli.
A form collected by Dr. G. H. Horn the coleopterist at Fort Grant Arizona is closely related to the shells described above.
In the Patagonia Mountains a short distance eastward from the locality of S. rowelli a smaller form of the species was collected by Mr. Ferriss PI.

The shell in the cotypes of this species is thin pale with a rather wide dark chestnut band without white borders and visible above the suture on the last 2h or 3 wliorls.
The surface is very minutely and very densely granulated over the usual low growthwrinkles.
Near the periphery some faint traces of spiral lines may be deciphered in places but they are so slight that they would have been overlooked if not especially looked for.
The umbilicus is small.

S. virilis is slightly smaller than S'.
hachitana with more rounded aperture and weak spiral lines near the suture.
From the shell alone I would not separate this form more than varietally from S. hachitana  but the enormously developed cJ rejroductive organs indicate one of the most distinct species of the genus.
The jaw has few ribs as in S. h. howiensis.
It is not closely related to any other species I have dissected.
The faint spiral lines of the shell are perhaps its most important differential feature.
Several lots collected by Mr. Ferriss in the Chiricahua Mountains resemble S. virilis in size color and sculpture but differ in having about onefourth of a whorl more 4f and a noticeably smaller aperture.
The spiral lines while visible in some places on all of them in a favorable light are often excessively weak.

The penis is well developed its lower part being muscular and plicate within the upper part thinner and densely finely papillose inside.
The epiphallus is well developed with terminal vas deferens or with a terminal tubercle representing the flagellum and a sublaterally inserted vas deferens.
The vagina is rather long.
The globular or ovate spermatheca terminates a slender duct nearly as long as the uterus.
Reproduction is viviparous.
The retractor muscle of the penis arises from the apex of the penis and base of the epiphallus or from the epiphallus near its base and is inserted on the lung floor.
The right ocular retractor passes between the 2 and 9 branches of the genitalia.
The jaw is strong arcuate its anterior face more or less distinctly striated vertically and there are sometimes very weak traces of ribs.
The radula is of the ordinary Helicid type.
In some species the median area has unicuspid teeth the cuttingedges usually overhanging the sides of the mesocone while in others distinct ectocones are developed in all the teeth.
The marginal teeth are bicuspid the cusps unsplit as a rule though there are exceptions where the inner of the two cusps is bifid.

This dominant type of Helicidce in the area indicated above formerly extended farther east one species occurring in the loess of Iowa and there is one outlying species westward 0. avalonensis Hemph. on Catalina Island California.
In its present area the type has been interminably modified into local races of all grades of differentiation more than fifty of these having received names. It is true that in some ranges every canyon I might almost say every rockheap  has its own race  but in a broader view it is seen that a single strain usualh' extends over an entire range with numerous minor modifications and with increasing elevation a general diminution of size loss of sculpture and often intensification of color.
These reduced forms are probably due to the diminished food supply and especially the shorter growing season in the heights  factors subject to great local variation even at equal ' The number of species of Oreohelix is uncertain.

270 Mch. altitudes.
To attain a true idea of the relationships of any given alticolous dwarf it is essential to know the forms of the lower canyons of the same region.
The first step toward a fundamental knowledge of the races and species of Oreohelix must be the study and definition of races in the broad sense above indicated.
In my opinion the minor modifications can be so overnamed that the wider distinctions become altogether lost as in the Utah series.
The field is vast and for many years to come there will be plenty of room for work.
Anybody who secmes a good series of the forms of any district can materially help the cause by working them up.
The sculpture of the embryonic shells and the genitalia seem to afford the most important characters for specific classification.

The types are from Conservatory Canyon otherwise known as Ramsey Canyon on the northeastern slope of the Huacnucas between Brown and Carr Canyons.
They are depressed with a broad umbilicus exposing more of the penultimate whorl than strigosa and it is also more ample within.
There arc 5 whorls of which 2h are embryonic.
The tip is a little depressed  the first whorl is delicately striate or wrinkled in an obliquely radial direction.
On the second whorl weak raised spiral lines asually set in and the last embryonic whorl is rather coarsely irregularly wrinkled radially and finely striate spirally with in some shells several raised threads on the last half whorl.
These cease abruptly at the end of the embryonic stage.
The following whorls are irregularly obliquely wrinkled and have at most obsolete spiral lines or traces of them in places often almost imperceptible.
The base has no spiral striation as a rule but in some specimens from Carr Canyon there arc faint spirals there.
Up to the end of the fourth whorl the periphery is strongly carinate but in adult shells it is nearly angular in front the last half or more becoming rounded.
The suture follows the crest of the keel and usually descends a trifle to the aperture.
The shell is fleshcolored above with irregular whitish streaks or maculse beneath the opaque white predominates more and there is a purplishbrown band close to the periphery but 4 or 5 of 25 examined are equally fleshtinted beneath and lack the band PI.

A. N. S. P. It lives in a moist situation in stone talus near the falls of the stream.
Cuticular processes or hairs are generally present on the shells of very young Oreohelices but in this one alone their development culminates in the adult snail.
Their projection at the angle of the whorls of the spire makes the lamellse look continuous over the sutures.
When denuded the shell is sharply striate with some illdefined spirals marking the positions of the more prominent cuticular wreaths.
Besides those described above there are some minor and variable spirals on the most perfect specimens.
The processes are very efficient as gatherers of soil hich is probably glued on by the mucous of the animal as usual.
In the general plan of ornamentation this bearded Oreohelix is not unlike Polygyra Stenotrema pilshryi Ferriss.
By its tricuspid central and bicuspid lateral teeth as well as by the general form of the shell 0. harbata recalls 0. he7nphiUi especially when denuded of the beard.
The embryonic sculpture is not very unlike some forms of hemphilli but it most resembles that of 0. s. socorroensis though a little coarser.
