RECORDS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF NON-SALTATORIAL ORTHOPTERA FROM BRITISH GUIANA.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN.
The records given in the following pages are all from a collection of Orthoptera made in 1901 at Demerara, British Guiana, by R, J.
Crew, and for the privilege of studying which the author is indebted to Prof. Lawrence Bruner.
The series contained sixty-one specimens, representing thirty-four species, of which six are new.
The types are in Prof. Bruner's collection.
BLATTID^.
ANAPLECTA Burmeister.
Anaplecta pulchella n. sp.
Type: 9 ; Demerara, British Guiana, 1901.
(R. J.
Crew.)
Closely allied to A. mexicana Saussure and dohrniana Saussure and Zehntner, but differing from mexicana in the narrowly incised supraanal plate, the more angulate proximal portion of the appendicular field of the wings, and in some details of the coloration.
From dohrniana it differs in the wings, in the coloration and somewhat in the shape, but agrees in the shape of the supra-anal plate.
Size rather large (for the genus); form rather flattened and subelliptical; surface glabrous.
Head about completely hidden under the pronotum; interspace between the eyes almost twice the depth of one of the eyes; antennse sparsely haired.
Pronotum transversely ovate, the cephalic margin regularly arcuate, caudal margin very slightly arcuate, lateral margins rounded obtuse-angulate ; disk somewhat deflected laterad.
Tegmina exceeding the apex of the abdomen, sublanceolate with the costal margin slightly arcuate except proximad where it is rather strongly arcuate, sutural margin straight, apex acute; basal field small, sub-coriaceous; anal field elongate sub-pyriform in shape and containing four veins; costal veins thirteen in number, the interspaces between the distal ones supplied with short spurious veins which do not coalesce with the discoidal vein; median vein with four rami of which the second (enumerating proximo-distad) is bifurcate.
Wings with the appendicular field of medium size, sub-rectangulate with the margins rounded and the proximal angle decidedly obtuse : clavate costal veins seven in number, the clavation being very large and short, in fact decided inflations, non-clavate costals five in number, distad of the clavate ones; medio-discoidal area with quadrate interspaces; axillary vein with one principal branch diverging caudad, which latter has two rami.
Supra-anal plate transverse, rounded with a slightly median emargination; subgenital plate not reaching to the apex of the supra-anal plate, inflated and with the caudal sectioncompressed and narrowly divided, reminding one of the structure of the valves of the Blattinae.
Femora with their ventral margins spined.
General color tawny above; head ochraceous with a pattern of four transverse and one short longitudinal occipital bars of seal brown, eyes seal brown, antennae ochre yellow proximad and dull brownish distad.
Pronotum with the disk seal brown and the lateral portions hyaline, the disk broad caudad narrowing cephalad.
Tegmina of the general color with a spot in the anal field, a more prominent one at the base of the discoidal field and another rounded one near the middle of the discoidal field raw umber.
Wings very slightly washed with olive, except the sections adjacent to the proximal portion of the costal margin and the caudal section of the inserted angle of the appendicular field, which are washed with ochre yellow.
Ventral surface and limbs pale clay color, margined, lined and touched with mummy brown.
Measurements.
Length of body, 7.6 mm.
Length of pronotum, 2.2 " Greatest width of pronotum, 3 " Length of tegmen, 8 '' Greatest width of tegmen, 2.5 '' The type is the only specimen seen.
Anaplecta fulgida Saussure.
Two males, two females.
Two of the above specimens belong to the form of the species with the disk of the pronotum dark, both sexes being represented.
The tegmina in these dark specimens are somewhat darker than in the other individuals.
This species has been recorded from Tabasco, Mexico, Guatemala and Piedras Negras, Costa Rica, this constituting the first South American record.
PSEUDOMOPS Serville.
Pseudomops crinicornis (Burmeister).
One male, one female.
While these specimens would, by their uniform black antennae, fall under luctuosa (Saussure), the original description of crinicornis contains nothing at variance with the material examined, no mention being made of the antennae, while the median whitish spots on the tegmina are distinctly specified.
It would appear from the description that the form described as crinicornis by Saussure and Zehntner^ is not the crinicornis of Burmeister.
Whether lectuosa is distinct from crinicornis is a matter which cannot be settled here, the two having already been synonymized.
The specimens studied show that the male is more uniformly colored than the female, the pronotum being without a light caudal margin and the median tegminal spots are absent, while the pale border of the coxae and ventral abdominal segments are much narrower than in the female.

These specimens agree well with the description except that the disk of the pronotum is red-brown overlaid with blackish instead of maroon brown as described.
Pseudophyllodromia prona n. sp.
Types: cJ^ and 9 ; Demerara, British Guiana.
1901.
(R. J.
Crew.)
Allied to P. peruana and lineolata Saussure, and differing from the former in the strongly lined interocular space, the color of the face and the coloration of the tegmina, the pale portions of the latter being small maculations and not whole areas.
From lineolata it differs in the maculation of the pronotum, the general color of the head and the smaller tegminal markings.
No other species of the genus appears to be any way as closely related as the two mentioned above.

; Demerara, British Guiana.
1901.

One male.
This specimen fits Brunner's description of this species, except that the bars on the pronotum are fairly well separated, while Brunner says ' ' linea separanti tenuissima. '
' Blattella inexpectata n. sp.
Type: ?
; Demerara, British Guiana.
1901.
(R. J.
Crew.)
In general appearance this form resembles B. parana (Walker) from Para, but it is larger with a richer coloration and with the caudal margin of the pronotum more arcuate.
In some respects this species resembles the vitrea-dilatata-pavida group but is more slender, bearing a considerable superficial resemblance to Ischnoptera hlattoides.
Size medium; form moderately depressed, elongate-elliptical; surface glabrous.
Head almost entirely covered by the pronotum, narrowest portion of the interspace between the eyes slightly less than the depth of one of the eyes; antennae well separated at the bases, in length extending caudad to the distal extremity of the caudal coxae.
Pronotum moderately transverse, ovate, narrow, cephalic margin subtruncate, caudal margin moderately arcuate with an extremely slight median angulation, lateral margins arcuate with the greatest width very slightly caudad of the middle; lateral sections moderately depressed.
Tegmina slightly exceeding the apex of the abdomen, the greatest width contained slightly more than three times in the length; costal margin arcuate, the arcuation of the proximal third much greater than that of the remainder of the margin; sutural margin nearly straight, very obhquely truncate in the apical fourth where it turns to meet the narrowly rounded apex ; basal field narrow and covering slightly more than a third of the length of the tegmen; anal field obovate in shape and about equalling the basal field in length ; costal veins about f om'teen in number, median vein with four rami, the distal of which has four branches, some of which has the branching carried two stages farther; anal area with five veins.

Median and caudal femora with the ventral margins spined.
General color ochraceous, becoming ochraceous-rufous on the disk of the pronotum and the section of the tegmina which when in repose cover the body.
Eyes bistre; lateral sections of the pronotum and costal section of the tegmina translucent ochre yellow, the section of the left tegmen which in repose is covered by the right is very pale, nearly buff in color.
Wings strongly washed with ochraceous; limbs pale ochraceoiLS.

Blatta tomentosa Serville, Orthopteres, p. 86.
[Surinam.]
Two males.
These specimens show some few characters at variance with the original description, but agree with the description of a female given by Saussure.2 Walker's tenebrosa from Demerara appears to be a rather different insect.

One female.
This specimen is referred to subsericeus instead of elegans Burmeister, of which the former has been considered a synonym.
The description of elegans, although very brief, does not fully fit the specimen in hand, while that of subsericeus fully describes the individual examined.
The author does not assert that the two are distinct species, but Saussure's name represents the type examined and Burmeister's does not.

Three males, one female.
The female is slightly larger than the type specimen, but otherwise the series is perfectly typical of the species.
The supra-anal plate of the male is rather produced, trigonal and fissate mesacl with the incision a mere slit to very near the apex; cerci about half again the length of the subgenital plate, tapering in the distal two-thirds; subgenital plate not reaching the caudal margin of the supra-anal plate, trigonal, supplied with lateral styles nearly a third the length of the cerci.

The base color of these specimens is maize yellow, and between the eyes the head bears dorsad a pair of tapering spots of mummy brown, â  ventrad a blotch of seal brown, which has laterad short bars of the same color extending ventrad between the antennae.
The pronotum is very finely sprinkled with, and the delicate pattern traced, in vandyke brown, while the tegmina have the discoidal and anal areas very thickly flecked with large and small spots of burnt umber, the basal and costal regions being comparatively clear with only small spots.

[^'enezuela.]
One female.
As far as can be determined from Brimner's description, which was based on a mutilated specimen, this individual appears to represent the species.
The color pattern is rather regular and typical of the genus, the maculations of the tegmina being uniformly distributed but larger in the discoidal field, while the whole insect has a strong suffusion of raAv sienna.
The head bears two spots of seal brown between the eyes, these spots being connected by a line of the same color which encloses a quadrate area between the antennae.

These specimens have a dark brown patch on the caudal section of the disk, and the caudal margin of the pronotum is narrowly suffused with the same color.
This pattern of coloration is evidently present in the type of Fabricius as he states: "Thorax ferrugineus, nitidus macula baseos nigra."
The golden hairs which are present on the lighter sections of the pronotum are also distributed over the brown area.
Holocompsa cyanea Burmeister.
Two males.
This species has been recorded from Brazil by Brunner.

[British Guiana.]
One female.
This specimen is the first of a number of individuals of this section of the genus examined by the author, which appears to fit Erichson's very poor description.
The pronotal maculation is confluent laterad with the blackish caudal margin.
This character appears to be what Erichson refers to in " Der Halsschild mit spitzer gerundeten Seiten, auf dem Riicken mit einigen kleinen, unbestimmten schwarzen Flecken, dagegen der Hinterrand breit schwarz gesaumt."
The figm*e of B. thoracicus given by Saussure and Zehntner represents very nearly the same thing, but a specimen from Costa Rica which I had considered thoracicus ^ has these lateral bars lacking.

(R.J.
Crew.)
Closely allied to A. quinquemaculata (St oil) from Cayenne, but differing in the coloration of the wings in both sexes, particularly in the absence of yellow in the male, and also in the short tegmina and wings of the female.
From brachyptera (Stoll) it can be separated by the unspined margins of the caudal section of the pronotum and the tuberculate abdomen, as well as the color of the wings of the male.
The coloration of the wings of fulgida-yand trifasciata readily separates the new form from these species.
Size rather large; form as usual in the genus, male bacilliform with elongate tegmina and wings, female^elongate with quite short tegmina and wings; surface smooth but not polished.

Tegmina about a fifth the length of the pronotum, reaching in repose to about the middle of the first abdominal segment, margins very slightly approximate distad; apex broadly rounded, stigma distinct.
Wings in repose extending beyond the tegmina by not quite a third the length of the latter, the length but slightly greater than the length of the tegmen.
Abdomen with the apex broad, depressed, the three terminal segments with very distinct median longitudinal marginal folds; supra-anal plate about as long as broad, the distal portion rounded; cerci broad, lamellate and truncate as usual in the genus; subgenital plate strongly compressed, rostrate, diverted ventrad out of the general abdominal plane.

Â« One male, one female.
Apparently this is the first record of the species with exact data.
This form can be separated from the allied P. injumata (Serville) by the finely denticulate lateral margins of the j^ronotum.

Not closely allied to any previously known species of the genus, differing in the absence of spines and in the lobation of the median and caudal femora.
This species may not be true Ceroys, but it does not belong to any of the present allied genera.
Size median; form moderately robust; surface smooth, not polished, unarmed.
Head rather long, subequal caudad of the eyes, occiput with a faint median longitudinal impressed line and several very weak ones laterad; eyes subglobose, moderately prominent; antennae filiform, about equal to the head and thorax in length, the proximal joint depressed.
Pronotum nearly half again as long as broad, the lateral margins somewhat incurved, cephalic margin moderately concave, caudal margin arcuate, transverse depression distinct, arcuate caudad, median longitudinal depression very faint and incomplete.
Mesonotum five and a half times the length of the pronotum, a distinct dorsal line present but no carina.
Metanotum (including median segment) about fiveeighths the length of the mesonotum, the median segment very distinctly longer than broad and exceeding the length of the remainder of the metanotum.
Abdomen distinctly exceeding the remainder of the body in length; four proximal joints simple, longitudinal and very slightly increasing in length distad; fifth segment expanded mesocaudad, in length about ec^ual to the fourth segment; sixth segment simple, slightly shorter than the first proximal segment; seventh segment two-thirds the length of the sixth, somewhat expanded caudad; eighth segment slightly shorter than the seventh ; ninth segment shorter than the eighth, compressed, carinate dorsad, narrowly emarginate caudad; supra-anal plate with the angulate tip alone visible; cerci compressed, tapering, blunt, the length about twothirds that of the ninth dorsal segment; subgenital opercule boat-shaped, carinate in the distal half, lanceolate, acute, not exceeding the tips of the cerci.
Limbs multicarinate, robust.
Cephalic femora about as long as the mesonotum, compressed, basal flexure very marked and abrupt, the two prominent dorsal and single ventral carina lamellato-carinate ; cephalic tibise about equal to the femora in length and with three lamellate carinse; tarsi with the proximal joint slightly longer than the remaining joints.
Median femora slightly shorter than the metanotum, the two 19 ventral lamellate carinse each with a prominent proximal and distal rounded foliaceous lobe, the dorso-cephalic carina also with a low proximal lobe; median tibiae about as long as the femora, the ventral carinse lamellate, but no lobes present; median tarsi with the proximal joint about equal to the remaining joints.
Caudal femora as long as the proximal two and a half abdominal segments, in structure similar to the median but with the dorsal lobe even smaller; caudal tibise slightly longer than the femora, in structure similar to the median tibise but slightly slenderer; caudal tarsi with the proximal joint distinctly but not greatly longer than the remaining joints.
General color Prout's brown obscurely marked on the head and limbs with bistre, the femoral lobes and extremities of the median and caudal tibise decidedly bistre ; antennse wood brown sprinkled with the general color.

One female (sex ?).
This individual is broken, but I presume it is a female.
The original description, while very brief, sums up the chief diagnostic characters of the species.
