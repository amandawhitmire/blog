DESCRIPTIONS OF FIVE NEW PHYLLOSTOME BATS.
BY GERRIT S. MILLER, JR.
The greater part of the material on which are based the descriptions of the following five new bats is contained in the United States National Museum, and the descriptions are published here by permission of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
An important collection from Jamaica, sent by the Museum of the Institute of Jamaica to the United States Department of Agriculture, and submitted to me for determination by Dr. C. Hart Merriam, includes topotypes of the little known Natalies micropus Dobson, and the unique type of Reithronycteris aphylla.
The type and only known specimen of Glossophaga longirostris forms part of a small collection of bats made by Mr. W. W. Brown, Jr., at Santa Marta, Colombia, and referred to me for identification by Mr. Outram Bangs.
Series of specimens from each of these collections are to be presented to the National Museum.
CHILONATALUS subgen.
nov. (Natalinae).
Type Natalus micropus Dobson.
Subgeneric characters.
— Similar to typical Natalus Gray, but with conspicuous dermal outgrowths on chin and above nostrils.
These outgrowths, as pointed out by Dobson, produce a strong resemblance to Chilonycteris.
Males with a large glandular swelling on forehead, between and slightly in front of eyes (figure 1).
General remarks.
— Natulus micropus and N. brevimanus differ so remarkably from the other members of the genus that they must be regarded as forming at least a distinct subgenus.
The form of the glandular elevation above the nostrils and the apparently double lower lip, taken in connection with the other characters pointed out by Harrison Allen in which the Fig.

Type.— Adult S (in alcohol), No.
15.835, United States National Museum, Old Providence Island, Caribbean Sea.
Presented by Chas.
B. Cory.
Specific characters.
— Slightly smaller than Natalus micropus Dobson 1 from Jamaica and with relatively longer ears and shorter fingers.
Color apparently paler than in N. micropus.
General remarks.
— Dr. J.
A. Allen recorded the occurrence of this bat on the island of Old Providence as long ago as 1890, but with only a single individual at hand, he naturally considered it the same as the Jamaican species.
On comparing fifty-seven specimens from Old Providence with three from Jamaica, I find a slight but remarkably constant difference.
Taking into consideration the perfect isolation of the two forms it seems best to apply to them binomial names.
The characters are well brought out in the following table of measurements.
The apparent lighter color of N. brevimanus may be due to the bleaching effect of alcohol, as I have seen no skins, and both lots of specimens have been preserved for an unknown length of time.
Micronycteris microtis sp.
nov. Type.— Adult $ (skin and skull) No.
if f f f , United States National Museum.
Collected at Greytown, Nicaragua, by Dr. L. F. H. Birt.
Specific characters.
— Smaller than Micronycteris minutus (Gervais); thumb, foot, calcar and membranes as in M. megalotis Gray ; ear from meatus about half as long as forearm ; middle lower premolar relatively larger than in M. megalotis ; general color wood-brown, scarcely paler on ventral surface.
Fur and color.
— The fur is distributed precisely as in M. megalotis, except that there is a slightly more extensive sprinkling of hairs on the dorsal surface of forearm.
Fur on middle of back about 10 mm.
in length.
Color uniform wood-brown, slightly richer on dorsal surface.
Hairs on body both dorsally and ventrally, nearly white through basal third.
Ears.
— Ears densely furred on basal half externally, the fur running up along anterior border to within 5 mm.
of tip.
Distal half 1 Proc.
Zool.
Soc.
Lond., 1880, p. 443. bare, with a few very fine scattered hairs.
In form the ears are much like those of M. megalotis.
Their tips, however, are more abruptly narrowed, a condition made still more apparent by their much smaller size.
Inner surface of auricle with eight sharply defined cross ridges arising at posterior border and extending about halfway across ear.
The distance between the uppermost and lowermost ridge is about 5 mm.
Feet.
— Foot distinctly shorter than calcar and slightly more than half as long as tibia.
Skull.
— In the type the brain case is more elevated immediately behind the orbits, and the zygomata are less flaring than in the skulls of 31. megalotis with which I have compared it, but these differences may prove to be individual.
Teeth.
— When viewed from above, the crowns of the three lower premolars appear to be of approximately equal size, though the second is slightly smaller than either of the others.
In 31. megalotis the crown of the middle lower premolar is very conspicuously smaller than the first.
In other respects the teeth of the two species appear to be identical.
General remarks.
— Micronyeteris microtis is so different from the other described species of the genus that it needs no special comparison with any.
From 31. megalotis its nearest geographical ally, its small ears and uniform wood brown color separate it at a glance.
Yet it is probably most closely related to 31. megalotis and 31. hirsuta, since 31. behnii and 31. minuta, the only other known species, are distinguished by differences in the proportions of the parts of the fingers and feet, to say nothing of the peculiar attachment of the wings in 31. minuta.
In the type of 3Iicro?iycteris microtis the exact form of the nose leaf cannot be determined.
The free, upright portion of the leaf, however, appears to be shorter and broader than in either of the races of 31. megalotis.
The whole leaf is finely pubescent.
The striation of the inner side of the ear is very different in 3Iicronycteris microtis and 31. megalotis.
In the latter, instead of eight sharply defined ridges crowded into the space of 5 mm., there are thirteen ill defined stria?
with a distance of nearly 10 mm.
between the first and last.
Micronyeteris megalotis mexicanus subsp.
nov.
Type.
— Adult 9 (in alcohol) No.
52,105, United States National Museum (Biological Survey collection).
Collected at Plantinar, 22 Jalisco, Mexico, April 4, 1892, by E. W. Nelson.
Original number 2,389.
Subspecific characters.
— About the size of typical Micronycteris megalotis Gray, but with longer middle finger and apparently lighter color.
General remarks.
— While the Mexican material at hand is fairly satisfactory, lacking only skins for the accurate determination of color characters, the South American series is very deficient.
Yet the nine specimens that I refer to true megalotis agree very closely among themselves, and differ fairly constantly from the Mexican form.
The color appears to be paler in the Mexican specimens, but as all are preserved in alcohol no special weight can be attached to this fact.
The real characters of the two forms are shown in the accompanying table of measurements.
Dobson's key to the species of Micronycteris (== ' Schizostoma ') rearranged and extended to include the two new forms just described is as follows : First phalanx of middle finger conspicuously shorter than second ; forearm 47 M. behnii (Peters).
First phalanx of middle finger approximately equal to second ; forearm 30-40.
Wings from tibise ; metacarpal of thumb about equal to remaining parts ; calcar shorter than foot .
.
M. minuta (Gervais).
Wings from tarsus or metatarsus ; metacarpal of thumb much longer than remaining parts ; calcar longer than foot.
Legs and forearms conspicuously hairy.
M. hirsuta (Peters).
Legs and forearms essentially bare.
Ear from meatus about one-half forearm M. microtis Miller.
Ear from meatus about two-thirds forearm.
Longest finger 60-64 .
M. megalotis megalotis Gray.
Longest finger 68-72 .
M. megalotis mexicanus Miller.

— In quality and distribution the fur resembles that of G. soricina.
It is 7 mm.
in length on middle of back, slightly longer on throat and shorter on belly.
Color above dark hair brown, slightly tinged with Prout's brown, the hairs everywhere very pale hair brown through basal two-thirds or three-fourths.
Belly light broccoli brown, becoming much darker on chest and throat.
Ears.
— As nearly as can be determined from the dried specimen the ears are essentially as in G. soricina, though considerably larger and apparently with broader tragus.
Skull.
— Aside from its conspicuously larger size the skull of Glossoohaga longirostris differs from that of G. soricina in its relatively longer rostrum, the sides of which are more nearly parallel, less strongly arched brain-case, and in the narrowness of the backward prolongation of the bony palate behind the plain of the last molar.
In G. soricina the width of the bony palate at the constriction immediately behind the last molar is contained only twice in the distance from the latter point to the tip of the hamular.
In G. longirostris it is contained nearly two and one-half times.
Teeth.
— In the only known specimen of Glossophaga longirostris— an adult, though by no means aged individual — the incisors have all been shed.
Distinct traces of the alveoli can still be seen in the mandible, but these are nearly obliterated in the upper jaw.
Whether this condition is normal, as in the genus Lichonycteris, 2 it is, of course, impossible to say.
In much older individuals of G. soricina and G. truei 3 the incisors are invariably present, so far as my observation has gone.
In relative size the premolars and molars are essentially as in G. soricina.
All, however, are very distinctly narrower.
Or, in other words, the teeth have shared in the general elongation of the jaws without undergoing any proportional increase in width.
In the lower premolars where the characters are most strongly marked, the width of each tooth is appreciably less than in G. soricina, while the longitudinal extent of the three together exceeds the same measurement in G. soricina by nearly one millimetre.

General remarks.
— Glossophaga longirostris needs no close comparison with other members of its genus.
Should the early deciduous incisors prove to be a constant character, the animal will probably require at least subgeneric separation from the forms related to 6r.

REITHRONYCTERIS gen. nov.
(Glossophaginse.)
Type Eeithronycteris apliylla sp.
nov. Generic characters.
— Dental formula (as in Phyllonycteris), i, 2 z 2 > c > ^~zr > P m > ~r > m > ^f^=32 ; zygomatic arches incomplete (as in Hemiderma) ; floor of brain-case from basisphenoid forward elevated out of its usual position, so that the roof of the posterior nares is formed by two longitudinal folds, given off by the pterygoids and nearly meeting in the median line in the region usually occupied by the basisphenoid and presphenoid (figures 3 and 4) ; calcar ab'sent ; nostrils perforating a disc shaped elevation which lacks a true "leaf" or free, pointed process above (the conditions are exactly reproduced in Brachyphylla) ; ears small and separate ; tongue broader than in Phyllonycteris and more abruptly narrowed at tip, the papillae short and stiff; tail about as long as femur.
General remarks.
— Reithronycteris is a very aberrant member of the subfamily Glossophagince.
Its broad teeth, heavy rostrum, massive lower jaw and broad tougue with short papillae remove it widely from extreme forms such as Chceronycteris and Lichonycteris.
In its reduced nose leaf and in the form of the mandible and of the mandibular teeth it resembles Brachyphylla.
Whether these characters indicate any real affinities with the Stenodermata is, however, very questionable.
6 In addition to these less important characters, Reithronycteris differs from all other bats with which I am acquainted in the structure of the interpterygoid region.
Measurements in parenthesis are those of an adult female, Glossophaga soricina.
from Cuernavaco, Morelos, Mexico (No.

Here Brachyphylla is united with Phyllonycteris to form the group ' Brachyphyllina,' placed at that end of the glossophagine series nearest the Stenodermatinse.
Reithronycteris aphylla sp.
nov.
Type.
— Adult $ (in alcohol) No.
9, Museum of the Institute of Jamaica.
Collected in Jamaica.
No further history.
Specific characters.
— External appearance much as in Phyllonycteris sezekorni Peters, 7 but muzzle conspicuously broader and terminating in a disc-shaped rudimentary nose leaf like that of Brachyphylla cavemarum.
Feet relatively larger thau in Phyllonycteris sezekorni, and interfemoral membrane much less developed.
Skull broader and more heavily built than that of P. sezekorni aud lacking the slender, but complete zygomatic arches often present in the latter.
8 Teeth conspicuously shorter and broader than in Phyllonycteris sezekorni; front lower molar very slightly larger than succeeding ones, not greatly elongated as in P. sezekorni.
Color, of specimen preserved in alcohol for an unknown period, light yellowish brown.
Fur and color.
— The fur is short, about 6 mm.
in length on middle of back, 4 mm.
on belly ; it is very closely confined to the body, barelv reaching the membranes.
Color both above and below light yellowish brown.
Ears and membranes light brown.
Ears.
— The ears are short; when laid forward they reach just beyond inner canthus of eye.
Anterior border strongly convex from base to a little above middle, then nearly straight to narrowly rounded off tip.
Posterior border slightly concave below tip, then convex (the curve about the same as that of anterior border) to base.
Posteriorbase in line with upper lip, the distance from cornerof mouth a little less than from the latter point to chin.
A wart (concealed by the hair) about as large as eye midway between corner of mouth and posterior base of ear.
Inner surface of ear with seven ill defined cross ridges.
Tragus a little less than half height of ear.
Anterior border gently and evenly convex from base to acicular tip.
Posterior border with four deep scallops, subtending as many prominent tooth like projections, of which the basal is less developed than the others (it does not show in the view from which figure was taken).
Feet.
— Foot very large, fully three-fourths as long as tibia, the toes deeply cleft and provided with large claws.
No trace of calcar.
7 This comparison is made with specimens from Nassau, Bahamas.
These may prove to be different from the typical Cuban form.
5 Dobson, basing his description on Jamaican material, states that in Pliyllonycteris the zygomatic arches are incomplete.
This is not true of the Bahaman specimens.
There is little reason, however, to believe that the Jamaican Phyllonycteris with pointed nose leaf is the same as that found in the Bahamas, and no certainty that either is true sezekorni.
1898.]
335 Membranes.
— Wings full and ample, attached at middle of tibia.
Uropatagium reduced to a narrow frill scarcely wider than the fleshy part of the thigh, and reaching not quite to middle of tibia.
Tail included to middle in membrane.
Tongue.
— The tongue (figure 5) while distinctly of the glossophagine type is considerably broader in proportion to its length than in any of the other members of the group that I have examined.
At the tip it narrows very abruptly to an unusually acute point.
The terminal area of elongated stiff papillse has much the same general shape as in Phyllonycteris sezekorni, allowance being made for the difference arising from the greater breadth of the tongue, but Fig.

» that the media,, (b).
(Slightly enlarged), groove is less conspicuous (this difference is very difficult to represent in the drawing).
Skull.
— The skull (figure 3) is larger and more massively built than that of Phyllonycteris or any other glassophagine genus with which I am acquainted.
The rostrum is especially broad and deep.
Face line straight from nostril to middle of brain case ; a well developed sagittal crest and lambdoid crest ; bony palate behind molars narrower than in Phyllonycteris sezekorni.
The hamular processes are very broad and strongly concave internally, the resulting form quite different from that in Phyllonycteris or Glossophaga.
The structure of the floor of the brain case has already been referred to.

— In number and arrangement the r y<*oTd, b.sp.==b&teeth agree with those of Phyllonycteris sezekorni, sisphenoid.
but in form they are even less typically glossophagine, than is especially the case with the mandibular teeth, which strongly resemble those of Brachyphylla cavemarum.
In relative size the teeth agree with those of Phyllonycteris sezekorni except that the front upper premolar is larger, the second upper premolar smaller, and the front lower molar much shorter.
The lower premolars are less crowded than in P. sezekorni.
Measurements.
— Total length, 88 ; head, 28 ; greatest breadth of muzzle in front of eyes, 10; eye to eye, 8; eye to tip of muzzle, 10.4 ; ear from meatus, 16 ; ear from crown, 13 ; width of ear, 12 ; tragus, 8 ; tail, 12 ; free part of tail, 6 ; tibia, 22.8 ; foot, 17 ; claws, 5 ; width of uropatagium at middle of femur, 6 ; forearm, 48 ; thumb, 14; second finger, 37 ; third finger, 84 ; fourth finger, 66; fifth finger, 64; penis, 10.

General remarks.
— Reithronycteris aphylla needs close comparison with only one described species, the Phyllonycteris poeyi of Gundlach.
8 This bat, from the " Kaffeepflanzung Fuudator," Cuba, is still wholly unknown except for the rather meagre original description.
