A NEW SPECIES OF COCCYZUS FROM ST. ANDREWS.
BY WITHER STONE.
The first collection of birds from the isolated island of St. Andrews in the Caribbean Sea seems to have been made in the winter of 18867 by Mr. Robert Henderson who was collecting for Mr. Charles B. Cory.
Nineteen species were obtained of which five were described as new by Mr. Cory. On May 1 1887 Dr. William L. Abbott stopped at the island and collected a few specimens representing six species.
Two of these Avere not obtained by Mr. Henderson namely Lampornis violicauda and a Coccyzus allied to C. minor but apparently distinct for which I would propose the name Coccyzus abbotti.
This bird differs from C. minor especially in its much longer bill and this character curiously enough is likewise conspicuous in Mimm magnirostris and Icterus laivrencei Uo other peculiar species separated by Mr. Cory.
