ON A COLLECTION OF FISHES FROM PARAGUAY, WITH A SYNOPSIS OF THE AMERICAN GENERA OF CICHLIDS.'
BY CARL H. EIGEXMAXX AND CLARENCE HAMILTON KENNEDY.
The Indiana University has received from Prof. J. Daniel Anisits, of the National University of Paraguay, a large and well-preserved collection of fishes made dming 1900 and 1901.
The collection consists of about 750 specimens and was made in the following localities : 1.
Rio Paraguay and Laguna Pasito; and Rio Paraz at Asuncion.
2.
Estancia La Armonia, Department Caapucu near the Laguna Ipoa, the largest lake in Paraguay, and into which all the streams of the neighborhood empty.
Collections were here made in the Arroyo Carumbey.
3.
Laguna Ipacaray and its tributary Arcgua, twenty-four kilometers east of Asuncion.
The laguna is about on a level with the Rio Paraguay and connected with it by the Arroyo Yuqucri.
4.
Rio Paraguay at Fuerte Olympo. '
5.
Laguna at Pirayu Paraguay.
6.
Campo Grande Lagunitas, five kilometers from Asuncion.
7.
Rio Apa, forming the northern boundary of Paraguay, and its tributaries Arroyo Pypucii, about one hundred and twenty kilometers from the Rio Paraguay.
8.
Arroyo Trementina, a tributary of the Rio Aquido Canigi and Aquadas and Lagunitas along the Arroyo.
9.
Arroyo Chagalalina, also a tributary of the Rio Aquido Canigi.
10.
Toldocuc Estero, near Arroyo Chagalalina.
11.
Salamanca, a landlocked lagima on a mountain near the Arroyo Pypucu, and between Rio Apa and Rio Aquidaban.
12.
Fazenda das Conchas, in a partially dried small laguna near Rio Branco, Matto Grosso, Brazil.
The collection contains also a series collected by Dr. Carl Ternetz in the Paraguay at Asuncion and at Descalvados, Matto Grosso, Brazil, In the present paper we give a list of all the specimens received, with descriptions of new species.
We have also prepared a synopsis of the genera of Cichlids.

Body slender, greatest width in front of pectoral 2^ in length.
Head and body moderately deep ; the greatest depth 7A in the length.
The depth at the base of the dorsal spine H in the distance from the tip of the snout to the base of the pectoral spine.
The ridges and knobs of the head well developed.
The skin over the snout and sides of the head very warty; the nuchal crest long and thin, extending f the distance to the base of the dorsal.
Just beyond its distal end is a small knob.
On each side of the anterior end of the nuchal crest is a lateral crest.
These lateral crests run § the length of the nuchal crest, converging slightly.
Further, on each side there are two prominent crests which pass obliciuely downward and forward to the short, high, humeral crest.
The interorbital space very concave.
The crests bounding it are the most prominent of any on the head.
They arise just back of the anterior nares, and after enclosing an elliptical space end at the base of the nuchal crest.
On each of these there are four prominent knobs, two just back of the eye, and two just in front of the nuchal crest.
The eyes are placed laterally in these ridges.
The interorbital width equals the snout plus the eye.
The maxillary barbels reach to the middle of the pectorals.
Mental barbels short, reaching ^ the distance to the post mentals.
Post mentals reaching to the anterior end of the gill cleft.
Coracoid processes parallel behind, their length If in the distance between them, the processes extending half-way to a perpendicular dropped from the base of the dorsal spine.
The coracoid processes and ridges very similar to those of B. bicolor.
Humeral process extending about ^ the length of the pectoral spine.
Pectoral pore small, touikI.
Skin everywhere covered with very conspicuous warts; those on the sides of the body and tail arranged in about 7 rows on each side.
2 The numbers in parentheses are the ones used by Prof. Anisits to indicate the various lots he collected.
The numbers of the types are those they bear in the register of the Indiana University.
The common names are those collected bv Prof. Anisits.
Distance of the dorsal from the tip of the snout 2f in the length.
Pectoral spines twice as long as the coracoid processes, armed on both edges with long hooks, those on the posterior edge and on the proximal half of the anterior edge pointing inward, those on the distal half of the anterior edge pointing outward.
Color dark brown; the numerous warts white, giving a speckled appearance.
The fins light })rown, irregularly speckled and mottled with darker.
This species is most closely related to B. gronovii and B. hicolor.
It agrees with gronovii in the distance of the dorsal spine from the tip of the snout and in having the keels and knobs of the head well developed.
It differs from gronovii in having the coracoid processes only half as long.
It agrees with hicolor in having 7 anal rays, and in the general shape of the coracoid ridges and processes.
It differs from hicolor in having the knobs and keels of the head l^etter developed.

Nat.
Hist,, 1SS7 (Rio Grande do Sul).
Sixteen alcoholic specimens (29), the largest 35 mm.
Estancia la Armonia.
Straw colored, a vertical humeral spot, a distinct caudal spot continued to the ends of the middle caudal rays, gradually narrowed and continued forward as a dark lateral band or line sometimes to the humeral spot, more frequently not so far.
Lateral line of the left side developed on 13, 24, 10, 13, 29, 11, 21, 10, 11, 25, 15, 10 (average 16) scales in as many individuals.
In those with the longest lateral line some of the scales are simply notched, without a developed tube.
A large number of formalin specimens from Pypucu (219) and a few from Arroyo Trementina (253) differ from the above in that the dark lateral band or line abruptly joins the caudal spot, appearing as a marking independent from that spot, while in the specimens from La Armonia it seems to be a direct continuation of that spot.
They are much darker, which is probably due to the preservation and also to the locality.
They differ also in having fewer scales with tubes.

Arroyo Trementina.
This species closely resembles Pcecilurichthys multiradiatus Steind.
It differs widely from all other species of Hemigrammus.
Description of type : Head ^^, depth 2\; D. 10; A.
46; scales 10-45-S. Compressed, ventral profile regularly arched, its lowest point between ventrals and anal; dorsal profile depressed at nape, angulated at the origin of the dorsal.
Eye large, h in snout, 2^ in head, 1 in interorbital.
]\Iouth small, maxillary reaching to eye, no teeth on its margin.
Suborbitals covering the entire cheek.
Scales largest over pectorals.
Lateral line extending, with interruptions increasing in size and frecjuency, to the last fourth of the anal.
Dorsal midway l^etween tip of snout and caudal, directly over origin of anal; caudal deeply forked; anal low and long, its length slightly exceeding the height of the body; ventrals reaching to anal, pectorals beyond origin of ventrals.
A dark spot at base of caudal, a narrow dusky lateral l:»and.
Base of caudal raA-s and a spot just above the origin of the lateral line yellow.
The co-t3'pes vary in some respects from the description given al;)0ve.
Anal 40-46; Lat.
1., 40-45.
In a few specimens there is a blackish humeral spot just above the origin of the lateral line.
The lateral line varies considerably in the degree of completeness.
In three specimens at least it extends to the caudal, but is interrupted.
In the majority it stops far short of the caudal.

These specimens differ distinctly from scabripinnis in color, having a conspicuous black band.
They were, however, preserved in formalin, which has a tendency to destroy the silvery structural bands and to bring out the underlying black pigmentary markhigs.
The species is evidently closely related to icappi from British Guiana.

The X. ferox of Giinther differs from falcatus chiefly in the length of the maxillary, also in the size of the eye, the scales, etc.
Both species have been found in the Essequibo river.
We have four specimens (33 and 49), ranging from 22 cm.
to 27 cm., from the Rio Paraguay at Asimcion.
There is no doubt that these specimens belong to the same species.
Their measurements are as follows: 27 cm.

The measiu'ements nearly bridge the differences said to exist between falcatus and ferox in the number of anal rays, the scales and length of the maxillary.
We have, therefore, placed ferox provisionally in the synonymy of falcatus, of which it is probably the yoiuig.
A specimen of X. falcatus in the collections of the Indiana University from "Brazil," 22 cm., differs from our smallest specimen in the shape of the mouth and the extent of the maxillary.
The maxillary extends for a distance equal to f diameters of the eye beyond its posterior border.
This difference is in part due to the greater length of the maxillary, and also in part to the fact that it makes less of an angle where it joins the premaxillary.
In the absence of specimens from the Rio San Francisco the A', lacustris of Reinhardt is kept distinct.
It is unquestionably a local race of falcatus, if it is not identical with it.

This species is evidently very closely related to JEquicIens dorsigera (Heckel) and Mquidens syspilus (Cope).
Steindachner states that dorsigera is characterized by a black spot on the spinous dorsal, which was present in all the numerous specimens examined by him.
None of the specimens of the new species have such a spot.
From syspilus,^^ as far as the meager figure and description of Cope permit a comparison, this species differs chiefly in the number of scales and rays.

A large black spot in the lateral band near the middle of the body.
A dark band down and slightly back from the eye; a dark band across forehead.
A black spot on upper haK of base of caudal.
Other specimens differ from the type in some respects.
Among all the specimens examined but one had XIII ; one had XV instead of XIV dorsal spines; a few had 10 rays in the dorsal.
The anal rays varied from 6-8.
The tubes of the lateral line varied from 14-17 on the anterior limb and from 6-10 on the posterior.
The color varies much in intensity and the median lateral spot and bar down from eye are more conspicuous in the young than in the adult, while the lateral band is much less conspicuous in the young.

Bibliography.
The collection and study of fishes has been more active in the southern part of South America during the last fifteen years than in the northern.
Several papers have appeared during this time on the fishes of Rio Grande do Sul, a larger number dealt with the fishes of one part or another of the La Plata system.
None of these papers offer a comprehensive account of the fishes of the system, being rather reports on definite collections.
We give below a list of the papers dealing with fishes of the La Plata basin published since 1890.

A COLLECTION OF EEPTILES AND BATKACHIANS FEOM ARKANSAS, INDIAN TERRITORY AND WESTERN TEXAS.
BY WITMER STONE.
During the months of March and April, 1903, Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry made a zoological reconnaissance in the Ozark Moimtain region of southwestern Missouri and southern Arkansas, visiting also parts of Indian Territory and Texas, in the interests of the Academy.
Among the material collected on the trip is an interesting series of reptiles and batrachians, which it has been my privilege to study and of which I herewith present a list.
While none of the forms appear to be new, the appended records are of much interest as a contribution to our knowledge of the distribution of species in a region which has been but little explored.
I have also added notes on such individual variations as the specimens present, and in the case of .the serpents have recorded the number of the caudals and ventrals in the largest and best preserved specimens, which may prove of value in studying the relationship of closely allied geographic races.

Terrapene major (Agassiz).
One specimen from Devil's river, Tex.
While I have no material for comparison, this specimen agrees with Mr. Taylor's description {Pr.
U. S. N. M., 1894, p. 576), and certainly can be referred to none of the others recognized in his monograph.
The locality is much farther west than any recorded in Mr. Taylor's paper, the nearest point from which he had a specimen being Galveston.
Terrapene triunguis (Agassiz).
A specimen from Limestone Gap, I. T., seems to be referable to this species.
Mr. Taylor {I.e., p. 581) states that "the Louisiana form seems to be a dwarf variety of this species," as noticed by Agassiz, and a series of twelve recently received from Avery's Island, La., through the kindness of Mr. E. A. Mcllhenny, support this view.
Inasmuch as Agassiz's type of triunguis came from Louisiana, it is the larger form that must be supplied with a name, should such a separation be deemed desirable.
The Indian Territory specimen before me is dull olive-brown, with more or less obscure yellowish radiating lines or blotches on the plates of the carapace, while the plastron is yellow mottled with small brown spots.
The Louisiana specimens vary from this same style of coloration to dark brown with small rounded bright yellow spots, arranged somewhat in radiating lines but entirely disconnected, plastron usually plain dull yellowish, sometimes with obscure transverse and radiating bands of brown; spots on the head bright yellow and reddish-orange.
The proportions of the two forms are as follows: Length of Greatest carapace.

Should it prove to be separable, Agassiz's name tristycha wquIcI apparently be available (type loc, ''Osage river, Mo., and Williamson county, Tex.").
The differences he points out — snout more prominent and lower jaw broader below the symphysis — while perceptible in the present specimen, are not sufficient for separation -v^dthout the examination of more material.

The Reptiles of Pecos.
The town of Pecos, Texas, lies on the west bank of the river bearing the same name, at an elevation of about 2,800 feet.
The high plain surrounding it and stretching west to the Rio Grande is much broken by irregular mountain ranges of considerably greater height.
The rainfall at Pecos does not exceed fifteen inches.
The mean annual temperature is 60° Fahr., and the winter minimum about 18°.
During the past four years forty-eight species and subspecies of living reptiles have been sent to the Zoological Gardens by Mr. E. Meyenberg, of Pecos, all of which were collected in the neighborhood, with the exception of a few from the Da.vis Mountains, some fifty miles southwest.
Many of these are little known and as I am aware of no published list of similar extent from this region, they are here enumerated.

XVII.
Sufficient material is not available for full determination of the mud-turtles of the Mexican border, and identification of the present species must be made upon slight clues, for no published description of it exists beyond the mention of a few characters considered by Agassiz to be generic.
These appear to apply to four turtles received in September, 1901, from Pecos.
In addition, I have a similar one from El Paso, collected by Messrs. Townsend and Barber, and there is a sixth belonging to the Academy, collected at San Antonio, in 1903, by Dr. H. A. Pilsbry.
In form and scutellation these turtles approach C. 'pennsylvanicwn.
The El Paso specimen is 130 mm.
in extreme length of shell and 97 in greatest breadth, a size rarely, if ever, reached by the eastern species.
In adult males the shell is depressed on the dorsal line and shows traces of a median keel, which does not appear in others, possibly female, of less dimensions.
The small San Antonio example shows it slightly on the posterior declivity.
The head is noticeably narrow and fiat; jaws weak and beak feebly hooked.
The feet are fully webbed and the foreclaws large and strong.
There is a patch of keeled tubercles above the heel.
The large El Paso specimen, which is male, is uniform greenish-olive on the carapace, each shield having a narrow black border on its hinder margin, most marked on the costals.
The plastron, which is concave and deeply striated, is yellow deepening to dark brown on the gulars and anals and on the bridge.
The head and neck are entirely without markings, uniform dark gray above, whitish on the sides and beneath.
Jaws yellowish with dark brown cutting edges.
Outer surface of limbs dark gray without markings, lighter beneath.
The largest Pecos specimen is 120 mm.
long and is similar, except that the back is darker, the plastron decidedly green and less grooved.
This is prol")ably a female.
The others are colored like the last, except one from Pecos 110 mm.
long, which has the carapace brownish-yellow, with hardly a trace of green, and the dark margins to the shields hardly visible.
The edge and under side of the marginals is dull orange.
Plastron yellow, darker in front and behind.
Compared with PL XVII in the Wheeler Survey, to which the name C. flavescens is attached, all my specimens have the shell narrower and more regularly oval; the head and neck are noticeably flat and narrow, and the pectoral shields are nearly triangular and form an exceedingly short suture as in pennsylvajiicum, instead of the wide one shown by the plate.
This species is nearly related to pennsylvanicuni, but as far as present material goes, is amply distinguished by its form of head and by color characters.
Its geographical limits remain to be established.
All the specimens I have seen are Texan.

C. collaris from Seymour, Texas.
In this series I find individuals with a single row of interorbitals, and those with them partly divided, to be each about two-fifths of the whole number, and those with a double row about one-fifth.
In association with these differences I do not find any constant changes in the size of the supraoculars, in length of snout or breadth of head.
The last two proportions vary with age, old examples having much broader heads.
These Seymour specimens are about half-grown and were all collected together.
The chief character of haileyi we thus find far outside of the region assigned to it, in company with undoubted collaris and intermediates.
Two Crotaphytus in the Academy's collection, taken by Rehn and Viereck in 1902, at Dry Canon, New Mexico, and assigned by Mr. Stone^ to C. c. haileyi are like the Pecos and Seymour examples with double interorbitals.
If these specimens are haileyi, it occurs promiscuously among collaris; if they are not haileyi, then the chief character of that species occurs as a meaningless variation in collaris, leaving the former species to stand upon slight and indefinable differences which vary with age.
In either case, the foundations of haileyi are not strengthened by their appearance.
Crotaphytus wislizeni B.
& G. Femoral pores in two specimens 18-22.
Length of ?
324 mm.
(tail 208).
This specimen in June has on the sides vertical bands and spots of vermilion, which extend on the upper surface of the fore and hind limbs and the under side of the tail.
The pale cross-bands have entirely disappeared from the body, but are distinct on another specimen 305 mm.
long.
Holbrookia maculata Giranl.
Five specimens belonging to the form considered by Cope to be H. m. maculata.
Femoral pores in most cases 11 or 13; maximum 13, minimum 9.
Holbrookia texana (Trosch.).
Femoral pores usually 14-15; maximum in nineteen specimens 16, minimum 12; very inconspicuous in females.
The hind leg may fall short of the eye or reach to the end of the snout.
A cJ^ in June, doubtless in full breeding color, is very striking, there being much orange on the shoulders, including the upper back, and on the forearms.
The hinder part of the back and sides and upper surface of the hind legs are bright green, becoming yellowish on the tail.
The jet-black lateral crescents are set in a patch of rich blue which does not meet its fellow Proc.
Acad, of Nat.
Set., 1903. p. 30.
35 on the abdomen.
Under side of thigh pale blue; l^ack of upper arm and front of forearm green.
In this species the postinfralabials below the angle of the jaw are usually in but one or two rows, but occasionally, as in the male above described, they are as numerous as in H. maculata.
TJta stansburiana B.
& G. Femoral pores in eighteen specimens 13-18.
Greatest length 150 mm.
(tail 93).
Uta ornata B.
& G. Femoral pores 12-16, usually about 13.
Greatest length 130 mm.
(tail 78).
The chief difference between U. ornata and U. symmetrica is said to be^ that in the former the hind leg is usually shorter than the distance from the collar to the vent, while in the last it is longer.
In nineteen U. ormita from Pecos and Seymour, I find that 3 d^ and 1 ?
have the hind leg longer than the distance stated; -1 c^ and 1 9 have it equal; and in 10 ?
it is shorter.
Soeloporus spinosus clarkii B.
& G. Four specimens received in May, 1901, from Pecos (now Nos.
15,74346 Academy collection) are referred to this subspecies.
They have the hinder large supraoculars in contact with the parietals and frontoparietals ; the preauricular scales are broader than long ; femoral pores 12-13; and an interrupted cervical collar.
The distinction between this form and *S'.
magister is of doubtful validity, a specimen from Tucson, Arizona, now before me, which on its preauricular scales would be assigned by ^Ir.
Stejneger to the last name, is less distinctly banded on the forearms than two of the Pecos specimens.
Sceloporus torquatus poinsetti b.

.3 p. 107. mour, Baylor county, in northern-central Texas, have similarly coarse scales, one has the collar-edge occupied by a row of granules, and in another the large scales of the collar are most distinct in the centre.
The pale dorsal area shows a tendency to contract and take on the form of a median stripe.
All these differences being in the direction of C. perplexus.
These specimens are noticeable for their small number of femoral pores, which are in each 13-14; (2) 14-15; 15-16.
The usual range in sexlineatus being 15-19.
Cnemidophorus sexlineatus perplexus B.
& G. I have a number of specimens from Pecos.
Compared with sexlineatus most of them have a slightly longer snout, causing the loreal and sometimes the postnasal to be elongated.
There are seven light stripes, the additional one being median and of the same width as the laterals.
This replaces the light dorsal area of sexlineatus.
Usually the light stripe on the back of the thigh is absent, but it is well marked in one young example 110 mm.
long.
The collar scales are less enlarged and occupy a somewhat triangular space in the centre, and the edge of the collar is usually formed by one or two rows of small granules, although two of my specimens have large scales on the edge.
The gular tract of minute scales contrasts less strongly with those surrounding it, and the dorsal scales are coarser.
According to Cope the femoral pores are 19, but in ten which I have examined they are 13-18, averaging 15.
The hind leg may reach the axilla or the eye, but in most cases about touches the ear.
One of my specimens has the anterior supraorbital separated from the next one by small granules.
The largest is 222 mm.
long (tail 158).
The proportions are slender.
Prof.
Cope regards this form as a subspecies of tessellatus, with which in general its scutellation agrees, though I find the number of femoral pores to be much less; but it does not appear to take on the spotted pattern of that species, and the fact that both sexlineatus and perplexus are striped at all ages and are more nearly equal in size and proportions, in connection with their disposition to intergrade where they come together in Texas, seems to indicate that they should be placed together as subspecies.
In both of them a few of the postantebrachials are sometimes a little enlarged, but in no case that I have seen do they even approach the large scuta characteristic of C. gularis.
Cnemidophorus grahami B.
& G. This species is almost identical with C. s. sexlineatus in scale characters.
The one specimen in the present collection has 21 femoral pores, which agrees with the number given by Cope.
It has a freno-orbital on one side.
At present this rather rare form seems to be amply separated by color characters.
Cnemidophorus tessellatus (Say).
Two specimens of the color form noted by Cope as C. t. tessellatus were received in May, 1903.
The largest measures 268 mm.
(tail 178).
They correspond closely with Cope's description, but one has the femoral pores 24, and the other 25, as against the maximum of 21 given by him.
The brachials are in from four to seven rows.
Both have round dark spots under the jaws, and in one the belly is tinged with orange.
The hind leg reaches the eye or a little less.
: A large series in the Academy's collection, secured by Messrs. Rehn ^-nd Viereck at Alamogordo, New Mexico, in 1902, shows no important variations from the Pecos specimens.
Femoral pores 22-25, average 9f fifteen 23. ,], Cnemidopliorus gularis B.
& G. Five examples from the Davis Mountains, south of Pecos, the largest of which measures 240 mm.
(tail 142), have femoral pores 15-17; brachials in 4-5 rows; antebrachials 3-4; femorals 6; tibials 3.
The hind limb is short, reaching only to the shoulder.
There is a row of white spots in each dark stripe, but these do not merge into the light interspaces.
There is a light dorsal area resembling but narrower than that of C. s. sexlineatus.
Some examples in juvenile pattern much resemble that species in this respect, while in others the light area is represented by two narrow lines corresponding to its outer borders, but gularis may always be distinguished by the large scales under the forearm.
Cope gives the femoral pores as 18-22, whereas, in a considerable series from Texas and New Mexico, I find but one with the number as great as Cope's minimum.
They range from 15-18, with an average of 16. .
While sexlineatus and gularis have doubtless had a common origin, the differentiation reached in adults is great, and I cannot regard the occasional retention of the earlier style of color marking by the yoimg of gularis as true intergradation.

No nuchal collar.
Ophibolus getulus sayi (Holbr.).
Most of those received from Pecos are of the color pattern called 0. splendidus B. and G., with unspotted tracts on the back.
I have elsewhere^ given reasons for refusing to recognize this color-form even as a subspecies.
In the latest note which I have seen, supporting its distinctness,^ the author says: "It is true that western examples of what is usually called ' Ophibolus sayi,' especially those from Arkansas and Indian Territory, approach the color pattern of L. splendida; but in the first place it is only an 'approach,' and in the second place they retain the normal number of 21 scale rows characteristic of the form w^hich we have just named L. holhrooki" ( = 0. g. sayi).
Prof.
Cope also says :® " I have not found any variation in the different scale formulas of the two."
The only comment to be made is that these gentlemen can not have coimted the scale rows in any large number of specimens.
I have before me at this moment five living examples from Pecos, showing more than an "approach" to the pattern of splendidus, one at least even having the head unspotted except on the snout; three of these have 23 rows, and two have 21.
The case seems analogous to that of Crotaphytus baileyi, already discussed, and does not strengthen the evidence for splendidus, unless selected individuals with 21 rows and usually spotted heads are to be called 0. g. sayi, and those with 23 rows and usually unspotted heads are 0. splendidus, even when they occur side by side — which would not commend itself as a conception of specific difference.

The Fauxal Relations of Texas Reptiles.
An attempt to determine the elements composing the local fauna above noticed, has led to a study of the reptiles of the entire State of Texas, the result of which is, in my belief, to establish three facts, hitherto not wholly free from uncertainty: first, that the boundary between the Austroriparian and Sonoran reptilian faunas lies approximately between the ninety-sixth and the ninety-eighth meridians of longitude in Texas; second, that the restricted Texan district of Cope is not Austroriparian but Sonoran; third, that transcontinental zones of distribution can not be maintained in the Medicolumbian region for reptiles.
In his final essay upon the life regions of North America, determined mainly by a study of reptiles and batrachians, Prof. Cope^ placed the portion of Texas extending from the high lands east of the Pecos river to a north and south line about the longitude of Austin, in his Texan district of the Austroriparian subregion, and the portion east of it, in the Louisianian district.
Western Texas he attached to his Chihuahuan district of the Sonoran subregion, which included the higher portion of central and northern Mexico, and stretched west through southern New Mexico and Arizona to southern and Lower California.
The great plains from northern Texas, east of the Rocky Mountains, excepting the east and west river bottoms, he called the Central district of the vSonoran.
Dr. C. Hart Merriam,* basing his conclusions chiefly upon the distribution of plants and mammals, established more or less parallel zones stretching completely across the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the greater part of temperate North America being occupied ''Rep.

The boundaries of his humid or AUistroriparian division of the Lower Austral agree in the main with Cope's Austroriparian subregion, and the arid division, which he termed the Lower Sonoran, with Cope's Chihuahuan.
In Cope's view^ the distribution of reptiles does not accord with the arrangement proposed by Merriam, for the reason that both in the east and the west, relationships in this class are much closer from south to north, than horizontally.
In the following examination, the term Austroriparian is used to denote the subregion so named by Cope, minus his Texan district.
For present purposes I include in it his Floridan subregion.
Sonoran is also used in Cope's sense.
I am able to find reliable records of the occurrence of one hundred and sixteen^" species and subspecies of reptiles within the State of Texas, and by plotting all the localities of their collection known to me, upon a map, they arrange themselves into the following categories: I.

— Austroriparian species, which extend west of longitude 98° in Texas : Chrysemys mohiliensis Ancistrodon piscivorus Zamenis flagellum flagellum Flaps fulvius Tropidonotus rhomhijer To these are to be added Cnemidophorus sexlineatus, Cyclophis (Bstivus, Liopeltis vernalis and Ancistrodon contortrix, which are also Eastern and to some extent Central.
V. — Neotropical intrusions : Dryniohius margaritiferus Sihon septentrionale Erythrola mprus imperialis It is seen that seventy-three Sonoran species practically fail to range east of longitude 96° in Texas, while but seven pass eastward to any distance beyond that meridian, five of these entering the western part only of the Austroriparian, while the two others are exceedingly rare east of the Mississippi river.
Of species which belong to the Austroriparian and Eastern, twentyfour w^hich enter Texas do not extend much beyond longitude 98°, while but nine pass beyond it into western Texas, and of these three are of aquatic habits and four more are widely ranging forms.
If anything is made clear, therefore, by a study of these lists, it is that the zone of change between the eastern and the western faunas is this north and south belt lying approximately between the 96th and 98th meridians.
This area nearly coincides with that in which the heavy rainfall of the Gulf Coast drops to below thirty inches annually, and lies somewhat eastward of where the arid region may properly be said to begin, the line of twenty inches rainfall being just west of the 100th meridian— a fact which suggests that species belonging to the dry plains fauna may endure a small addition of moisture better than those from a moist region can withstand drought.
In a general way it is also the region where elevations of less than 1,000 feet begin the rise which reaches to between 3,000 and 5,000 on the plateau bordering the Pecos river.
Its western boundary is probably the beginning of what Cope terms "the first plateau."
The geographical limits of Cope's Texan district are nowhere clearly marked out by him, and his views as to its affinities were subject to change.
In 1875'^ he says the Sonoran ''occupies the lower valley of the Rio Grande, and extends into Texas as far as the desert east of the Pecos."
East of this lay his Texan district, without defined limits on the east and south, which he assigns to the Austroriparian subregion.
In 1880" he speaks of the Texan district as Sonoran, and appears to consider it as beginning on the west at about 3,000 feet elevation, its eastern boimdary running north and south near longitude 98° to within twenty miles of San Antonio, from whence it stretched west to the Rio Grande.
In 1896^^ he returned without comment to his earlier opinion and put the Texan district back in the Austroriparian.
It may be possible at present to reach a definite opinion as to its proper association.
If the Texan district be regarded as beginning at the debatable zone which has been indicated here, between 98° and 96° longitude, and extending sovith to the Rio Grande and west to the Pecos river, it is found that the elements composing its reptilian fauna are the following : Sonoran: Chihuahuan ^9 Central ^ — 47 Texan (restricted) ^^ Austroriparian ^ Of wide range 69 As far as is now known several of its peculiar species, as Holbrookia propinqua and Sceloporus thayeri, range slightly to the south and west, outside of the boundaries here assigned to it, and may ultimately have to be regarded as Chihuahuan, but in the main they appear to be confined to these hmits.

18 American Naturalist, November and December, 1896. in the absence of the Chihuahuan species Crotaphytus wislizeni, Uta stansburiana, Sceloporus spinosiis clarkii, Cnemidophorus perplexus and Crotalus molossus, none of which seem to range east of the Pecos.
This large number of pecuhar species quite justifies the setting aside of a Texan district, but the overwhelming proportion of its Sonoran forms relegates it to that subregion, and not to the Austroriparian, with which it was finally associated by Cope.
The boundary thus determined between the Austroriparian and Sonoran subregions corresponds closely to that given by Merriam" to his Humid and Arid divisions of the Lower Austral, and it remains only to inquire into the reciprocal relations of the reptiles inhabiting these areas.
The Chihuahuan and Texan districts together share twenty-three species with the Central, while of the sixteen which they have in common with the Austroriparian, five (Chrysemys elegans, Diadophis amabilis, Ophibolus getulus sayi, Eutmiia proxima and Tantilla gracilis) are also Central and only enter the western part of the Austroriparian.
Four more (Ciiemidophorus sexlineatus, Cyclophis cestivus, Liopeltis vernalis and Ancistrodon coniortrix) are both Central and Eastern.
But seven species are therefore left common to and restricted to the Sonoran and Austroriparian {Chrysemys mobilensis, Sceloporus spinosus spinosiis, Tropidonotus clarkii, Tropidonotus rhombifer, Zamenis flagellum flagellum, Flaps fulvius and Ancistrodon piscivorus), and of these, four being aquatic are rendered in some degree independent of the laws governing the migration of land forms.
So far as their species are concerned these two subregions have very little in common.
Turning now to the genera recorded from Texas, twenty-five, found in both subregions, are of such wide range in the Medicolumbian that they are without l^earing on the present question and may be left out of consideration.
The following Sonoran genera do not enter the Austi'oriparian: Crotaphytus C.B.
Barissia Holbrookia C. Anniella Uta B. Glauconia Lysopticus Salvadora Phrynosoma C.B.
Arizona Eublepharis Rhinochilus C. Hcloderma Contia Gerrhonoti's Hypsiglena C. Amphiardis ^'^Proc.

Of Austroriparian genera these do not range into the Sonoran :™ Alligator N. Farancia Anolis N. Rhadinia N. Ophisaurus Stilosoma Rhineura^.
Cemophora Spilotes N, Seminatrix Abastor Liodytes I do not know of a single truly Sonoran genus which extends into the Austroriparian which is not found in other subregions as well.
No strictly Austroriparian genus extends into the Chihuahuan, and no genus is common to both areas which is not found elsewhere.
So far as genera are concerned, the only bond of unity between the two halves of the Lower Austral ( = Austroriparian + Texan and Chihuahuan of Cope) is that they alone in the Medicolumbian share Testudo, Tantilla and Elaps, all of which are Neotropical.
The Sonoran shares the following genera with the Central: Crotaphytus, Holbrookia, Phrynosoma, Rhinochilus, Hypsiglena.
It is clear, then, that the community in reptiles between the Sonoran and the Austroriparian is much less than that between the Sonoran and the Central; it is, in fact, limited to widely ranging genera.
While it is not intended to go into the details of distribution throughout North America, a few general observations must be stated, because of their bearing upon the present question.
The usual tests, such as differentiation, predominance in numbers, and genetic relationship, used in determining centres of distribution, all point among reptiles to the two southern centres in the Medicolumbian, to which attention has been directed by Prof. C. C. Adams,^^ the location of which corresponds to the southeastern Austroriparian and the Chihuahuan.
The former gave rise to nearly all the aquatic turtles.
It has supplied most of the widely ranging genera of snakes, some of which, as Coluber, Zamenis and Tropidonotus, as well as E7nys among turtles, are found also in the Eurasian portion of the Holarctic.
Its scarcity of lizards amounts to poverty.
The reptiles of the Eastern subregion are almost wholly derived from this southeastern centre; no genus is peculiar to it, and but few species, especially east of the Alleghenies.
The differences between its eastern and western portions are considerable, and in the Mississippi valley it shares a few snakes with the Central, some of which are Texan and Chihuahuan.
Upon reptiles alone, the Eastern could hardly be maintained as a subregion apart from the Austroriparian and of equal rank.
'"> Those marked N. are Neotropical. "
Biol.
Bull., Vol.
Ill, p. 121 (1902) ■ The Chihuahuan has given origin to no widely ranging snakes except Crotalus and Sistrurus.
Its great wealth of lizards has not spread extensively into the Atlantic slope.
Sceloporus and Cnemidophorus being represented there by but one species each; Eumeces by one which reaches to Canada and perhaps two others more southern and scarce in numbers; and the one species of Liolepisma, reaching to New Jersey.
That the Austroriparian fauna is the older of the two is made probable by the geological age of the region, and certain by the character of its forms, many of which belong to genera widely spread in the Holarctic, others having obvious genetic relationship to these or to other ancient forms.
The separate identity of these two faunas, as far back as they can be traced, confirms the conclusion already reached from their present distribution, that the association of the Sonoran with the Austroriparian into one transcontinental zone is unnatural and cannot be maintained for reptiles.
How far the stations occupied by reptiles conform to Dr. Merriam's vertical zones, when the attempt is made to correlate these in widely distant localities, can not now be determined.
At a later time I hope to examine this branch of the subject in some detail, but even with the limited amount of information now available of the kind needed, certain anomalies appear which do not seem open to explanation by that theory.
Indeed the proposition that all forms of life must conform to the same areas of distribution accords with neither theory nor facts.
It may be, as stated by the distinguished author of transcontinental life zones ,^^ and doubtless is, illogical to assume that a faunal and a floral map must differ; but it is quite otherwise to assume as a working hypothesis that they may do so, and when organisms differ as widely in physiological adaptations as reptiles, for instance, do from mammals, the assumption that their reactions to the same conditions of environment must be similar, certainly is not far from likeness to a well-known logical fallacy.
While there can be no doubt of the controlling influence of temperature upon the distribution of reptiles as a class, it is c^uite certain that moisture plays a more important part in regulating the range of its genera and species than is the case with either mammals or birds, especially when their limited powers of migration are considered.
The details of their distribution in the southern divisions of the Medicolumbian sufficiently show its potency. "
