NOTES ON MR. THOMAS MEEHAN'S PAPER ON THE PLANTS OF LEWIS AND CLARK'S EXPEDITION ACROSS THE CONTINENT 180406.
BY DR. ELLIOTT COUES.
Many years ago I prepared for publication in these Proceedings a paper on the plants of Fort Macon N. C. It never appeared because I submitted it to Professor Asa Gray who told me it was a very good one but asked me what was the use of printing it.
Taking the hint to heart I have from that day to this curbed any aspirations I may have felt to botanical authorship  and it now behooves me to explain why I presume to have anything to say on a botanical subject.
In fact I do not now write on Lewis and Clark's plants but solely on the localities where their plants were procured.
I do not pretend to any knowledge of botany but if there is anything I do know it is exactly where Lewis and Clark were on every day almost every hour from start to finish of their famous expedition.
Consequently I can give the precise locality of every specimen which bears a date in the herbarium that Mr. Meehan recently discovered to be still extant and thus available for the determination of so many of the type specimens of Pursh's species.
This discovery seems to me one of the happiest and most important that could have been made and I doubt not that Mr. Meehan's identifications of these plants with the assistance of Messrs. Robinson and Greenman will be justly regarded as a boon to working botanists.
I could wish that these writers had effected what I conceive should have been done to set forth the whole matter in its proper light but since they did not give the requisite precision to Pursh's generally loose and vague sometimes wholly erroneous indications of locality that duty seems to devolve upon me.
In reading Mr. Meehan's paper I have been little short of astounded at the kind of geography which seems to have answered the purposes of the botanists concerned in this case.
Nothing of the sort would satisfy a zoologist I am sure.
To describe a new species upon a type specimen assigned to  the banks of the Missouri or to  the valleys of the Rocky Mountains would not be tolerated in zoology and should not be endured in botany when the data required to pin every dated specimen down to the precise spot where it was collected are ample and easily accessible in the edition of Lewis and Clark which I brought out in 1893.
Neither praise nor blame attaches to me for any of the botany which appears in that work.
As stated in my preface most of the botanical determinations were those of Mr. F. H. Knowlton whom I engaged for that purpose and whose identifications of the plants mentioned or described by Lewis and Clark I accepted without question in any instance.
That they should all prove to be correct was not to be expected and I am now aware of several errors.
In the case of the trees the mistakes have perhaps all been detected and corrected in the admirable critical review lately published by Professor C. S. Sargent in Garden and Forest Nos.
465 466 January 20th and 27 1897.
I could wish that the same searchlight had been turned by Mr. Meehan and his collaborators upon the rest of the botany in my book and venture to suggest that the whole subject will not be put in its full light or final shape till this has been thoroughly well done.
Great as are the obligations under which Mr. Meehan and his assistants have placed all who are in any way interested in this subject in the paper which I now proceed to annotate geographically there remains for some one the agreeable and useful task of reviewing Lewis and Clark's botanical text as distinguished from their specimens.
For it is a curious fact as I find on studying Mr. Meehan's paper that the plants of which Lewis and Clark have most to say in their Journal are not as a rule those of which specimens are now extant in their herbarium.
Their botany it may be said runs in two parallel courses.
One of these is represented by the specimens which they collected and which became so many of Pursh's types  the other by the herbs shrubs and trees which they observed and noted in their narrative but did not actually collect.
Oftentimes to be sure they describe what is in the herbarium but I should imagine that fifty if not a hundred species are to be found in the book no specimens of which are known to be extant.
This would appear to me to be a field of research at once alluring and stimulating to some well equipped botanist and I trust that the work may soon be done once and forever.
Lewis and Clark's whole botany could easily be set abreast of the status I have myself been able to confer upon their zoology their ethnology and their geography.
With these remarks which I trust will be found neither ungracious nor presumptuous I proceed to review Mr. Meehan's paper from a purely geographical point of view.
I take his list precisely as it stands assuming the identifications to be correct in every instance and raising no botanical questions whatever.
I only follow the zoologists' rules of nomenclature in writing all specific and subspecific names with a lower case initial letter all personal names in the genitive case with a single i all trinomial names without the intervention of  var.
 a practice which I think most botanists would like if they could once get used to it.
Anemone canadensis L. A. pennsylvanica L. August 17 180If.
Missouri River close to the mouth of the creek on which the Omahas resided  now Omadi Creek in Dakota Co. Nebraska.
L.  C. there August 1320 1804.
Anemone quinquefolia L. June 15 1806.
Collins' Creek a branch of the Kooskooskee  now Nahwah River or Lo Lo fork of Clearwater River in Shoshone Co. Idaho.
Clematis douglasi Hook.
ft MrsuUsaima Pursh Fl. 384.
No date.
Pursh has  plains of the Columbia May.
L.  C. were not on the Columbia itself in May of either year.
In May 1806 they travelled by land approximately up Snake River or Lewis' fork to the mouth of the Kooskooskee lst4th up the Kooskooskee 4th13th and were at their Camp Chopunnish on the right bank of the Kooskooskee nearly opposite but a little below the mouth of Commearp Creek now known as Lawyer's Canon Creek till June 10th.
This is a notable locality where many plants were collected in May and June 1806.
The position is in Shoshone Co. across the river from and nearly opposite that of present Kamai or Kamiah in Nez Perces Co. Idaho.
Delphinium menziesi DC.
April llf. 1806.
On the Columbia River one day's journey by boat below The Dalles coming up stream.
Dentaria tenella Pursh Fl.
439.
April 1 1806.
On the Columbia at the mouth of Quicksand River of L.  C now called Sandy River.
This explains the statement of locality in Mr. Meehan's paper as  Columbia near quicksands.
Erysimum aspersum DC.
E. lanceolatum Pursh FI.
436 nee R. Br.
June 1 1806.
Camp Chopunnish as above described.
This is on the Kooskooskee.
But the other specimen which Mr. Meehan adduces from  Rockford Camp April 17 1806 is from The Dalles of the Columbia. 
Rockford  Camp elsewhere called  Rocky  or  Rock is a mistake for Rock Fort or Fort Rock Camp as L.  C. called it when they were at The Dalles.
The position is at the mouth of their Quinett Creek called Wasco Creek on some maps and now Mill Creek.
The position is one of the best known on the Columbia Oregon side.
L.  C. were there October 17 1805 going down and April 1517 1806 coming up.
Cleome integrifolia T.  G. C. serrulata Pursh Fl.
441.
August 25 180 Jf.
At or very near mouth of Vermilion River Clay Co. South Dakota.
Whitestone River of L.  C. August 29 1806.
At or near mouth of White River Lyman Co. South Dakota.
Cerastium arvense L. C. elongatum Pursh Fl.
321.
April 22 1806.
On the Columbia between Des Chutes and John Day Rivers the Towanahiooks and Le Page's Rivers of L.  C. 
Plains of the Columbia as given is therefore quite right.
Malvastrum coccineum Gray.
Grietaria coccinea Pursh Fl.
453.
July 20 1806. 
Plains of the Missouri as given is a mistake unless the phrase is used in a very broad sense.
On this date the expedition was widely separated.
Lewis was high up on Maria's River near its forks in N. W. Montana  Clark was on the Yellowstone at Camp Cottonwood above Clark's fork of that river.
Clark was busy building boats and no doubt Lewis collected the plant.
The latter botanized that day as we see by his Journal p. 1090 of my edition.
Linum lewisi Pursh Fl.
210.
July 9 1806 and July 19 1806 for the same specimen  the dates conflict but  valleys of the Rocky Mountains as given can be right for neither date in 1806 if the locality of this particular specimen is meant.
On July 9 1806 Lewis was on Sun River at or near Fort Shaw Montana.
On July 19 1806 he was high up on Maria's River both of these places are out of the mountains.
But probably the label was only meant to indicate the general range of the plant not the exact locality of the specimen.
Perennial flax was first noticed by the expedition on the Missouri above the Great Falls  for several days before July 19 1805 below at and above Dearborn's River in the vicinity not close of Helena Montana.
The species then described was identified as L. perenne by Mr. F. H. Knowlton p. 423 of my edition of the work.
Some of the country traversed in July 1805 distinctly includes valleys of the Rocky Mountains and I suspect that  1806  should read 1805  also that July  9  and  19  are merely scribal duplication of a single date.
Claytonia lanceolata Pursh Fl.
175 t. 3.
June 27 1806.
Headwaters of the Kooskooskee is quite right.
L.  C. were on the Lo Lo or Northern Nez Perce Trail along the divide between sources of both N. and S. forks of that river in central Idaho.
It is the same day on which they notice Erythronium grandiflorum.
Claytonia perfoliata Don.

Same as the last.
Lewisia rediviva Pursh Fl.
368.
July 1 1806.
At mouth of Traveller's Rest Creek of L.  C .
e. of the Lou Lou Fork of the Bitterroot River some 12 miles south of Missoula Montana.
It should be explained  Clark's River the assigned location of this plant and some others always means Bitterroot River in so far as any plants collected are concerned.
Lewis named Clark's River September 6 1805 when the expedition was in Ross' Hole near the head of the east fork of the Bitterroot River  the party went down this river only as far as the Lou Lou Fork just said up which they turned sharp and so on over the Bitterroot range to the sources of the Kooskooskee.
They were never on the Clark's River of modern geography as the great stream of which the Bitterroot is a collateral head does not now bear Clark's name above the junction of the Bitterroot with Hellgate River.
I may add that Letvisia rediviva the racine amere or bitter root of the French is the plant from which the river its valley and the mountain range on the west derive their name.
An alternative name of the Bitterroot was St. Mary's River imposed by Father P. J.
De Smet in 1842.
Montia parviflora Howell.
Claytonia perfoliate Pursh Fl.
176 nee Don.
March 26 1806.

As above said for Claytonia perfoliata.
Montia sibirica Howell.
Claytonia ahinoides Pursh Fl.
175.
April 8 1806.
As above said for Claytonia sibirica.
There seems to be a duplication of the record of the same specimens of this and preceding species in Mr. Meehan's main text and footnotes.
Pachystima myrsinites Raf.
Ilex 
myrsinites Pursh Fl.

November 16 1805.
In camp on the Columbia in sight of the ocean at the landward end of Haley's or Baker's Bay just inside Chinook Point.
I heartily agree with Mr. Meehan that the name of this genus should be written Pachystigma.

First discovered in the neighborhood of the Kancez River i. e. when L.  C. were about the mouth of Kansas or Kaw River which was reached June 26 1804 now very common means at the date said Oct. 1 when they were in the said bend.
Cissus ampelopsis Pers.
September 14 1806. 
Council Bluffs Missouri as given is not any locality for Council Bluffs Pottawattamie Co. Iowa did not exist in 1806 and the Council Bluff of L.  C. was much higher up and on the other side of the river where now stands Fort Calhoun Washington Co. Nebraska.
L.  C. passed it September 8 1806 coming rapidly down river  they were therefore many miles below when they camped at Leavenworth Kansas on the 14th having come 53 miles that day.
Acer circinatum Pursh Fl.
267.
October   1805. 
Great Rapids of the Columbia.
The date can be set closer as L.  C. did not reach the Cascades till October 30 1805.
The vine maple is fully described on p. 834 of my edition along with Acer macrophyllum.
Acer macrophyllum Pursh Fl.
267.
April 10 1806.
Cascades of the Columbia on the home voyage.
But L.  C. had noticed it in the same region the previous autumn.

Great Bend of the Missouri as stated.
This formation is below Pierre South Dakota and just above the Crow Creek Agency.
Astragalus missouriensis Nutt.

September 5 180J..
Mouth of the Niobrara River or within one day above it.
20 Lupinus argenteus Pursh Fl.
468.
July 7 1806. 
On the Cokahlaishkit   an interesting locality.
This is the River of the Road to Buffalo of L.  C now the Big Blackfoot River a branch of Hellgate River.
On the 7th Lewis was on its headwaters as this is the day he went over Lewis and Clark's Pass of the Continental Divide to the Middle Fork of Dearborn's River thus passing from Deer Lodge County to Lewis and Clark County Montana.

July   1806. 
Near the head of Clark's River  means the Bitterroot River at the mouth of its Lou Lou branch the Traveller's Rest Creek of L.  C and the date is July 1st or 2d when Lewis was botanizing as the Journal shows p. 1065 of my edition.
See Trifollum microcephalum below.
Petalostemon violaceus Mchx.
Pursh Fl.
461.
July 22 1806. 
On the Missouri   impossible.
At this date Lewis was on Cutbank Creek one of the main headwaters of Maria's River in N. W. Montana near the foot of the Rocky Mountains and Clark was on the Yellowstone.
No doubt Lewis collected the specimen.
September 2d year not given  no locality indicated.
If 1804 at Bonhomme South Dakota  if 1805 on Fish Creek a tributary of Salmon River Idaho  if 1806 at or near James' River South Dakota.
The first and third of these are practically the same locality as the expedition crossed the years 1804 and 1806 in passing Bonhomme Island on September 1st.
I presume the year is 1804 for in the case of the related Psoralea argophylla collected October 17 1804 and in the present case of Petalostemon violaceus Lewis makes similar remarks on the use of these plants by the Indians in decoctions for wounds.
Psoralea argophylla Pursh Fl.

Same spot as Oxytropis nana above  here called u Valley of Clark's River.
The Journal p. 1066 of my edition speaks of  two species  of clover in this valley one with a very narrow small leaf and a pale red flower the other with a white flower and nearly as luxuriant in its growth as our red clover.
Amelanchier alnifolia Xutt.
Pyrus sanguined Pursh Fl.

Crataegus douglasi Lindl.
C. glandnlosue Pursh Fl.
337.
April 29 or 19 1806  for dates conflict in main text and its footnote.
If 19th the place is Celilo Fails of the Columbia if 29th mouth of Wallawalla River on the Columbia site of old Fort Walla walla and of modern Wallula.
It is also elsewhere reported by L.  C. on the Columbia much lower down.
Mr. Meehan refers to the Journal of January 20 1806 but there is no allusion to the plant at that date.
He evidently means the description of No.
12 of the botanical list drawn up at Fort Clatsop  this is found on p. 826 of my edition but there are no dates in this list.
I am sorry to find that Mr. Knowlton has discredited the identification supposing No.
12 to be Pyrus rivularis.
It is correctly given however on p. 908 March 25 1806 when the expedition was in the vicinity of Puget's Island.
Again on June 10 1806 p. 1041 of my edition when L.  C. left Camp Chopunnish they speak of the  purple haw and Mr. Knowlton there bracketed Viburnum pauciflorum  no doubt in error as pointed out by Professor C. S. Sargent in his admirable paper on the trees of the expedition in Garden and Forest No.

355.
July 5 1806. 
Prairie of the Knobs as given is a remakable place on the Cokahlaishkit or Big Blackfoot River one day west of Lewis and Clark's Pass in Deer Lodge County Montana.
It is also called Blackfoot Prairie and Stevens' Prairie but Lewis did not reach it till July 6th.
Primus demissa Nutt.
August 10 1806. 
A cherry found near the beaver bents on the Missouri.
I do not know what these are but the place meant is present Beaver Creek in Flaunery Co. North Dakota almost on the border of Mountraille Co. about where present White Earth River not the one so named by L.  C. falls into the left bank of the Missouri.
The Journal of this date p. 1173 of my edition has this note   In the low grounds of the river Captain Clark found today a species of cherry which he had never seen before and which seems peculiar to this small district of country though even here it is not very abundant.
No identification was offered in my work as I had no hint of what the species was and I am particularly jleased now to find it out.
Prunus virginiana L. May 29 1806.

Mr. Meehan cites May 18 1806 Camp Chopunnish as the date on which L.  C. saw the wild roses in bloom.
I find no allusion to roses in the Journal of that day but on June 10 1806 when L.  C. had just left Camp Chopunnish they  observed two species of wild rose both of a damaskred color.
These Mr. Knowlton supposed to be R. nutkana and R. sayi  which names were accordingly bracketed in my edition p. 1041.

Three Forks of the Missouri junction of Jefferson Madison and Gallatin Rivers.
Both currants and gooseberries are mentioned at this date and one species which Mr. Knowlton identified from the description as R. oxyacanthoides is described at length  fruit large jet black with crimson pulp extremely acid etc.
But the original mention of R. aureum is earlier in the work p. 419 July 17 1805 when L.  C. were at Pine or Half Breed Island and Rapids a little below the mouth of Dearborn River.
It is here particularly described along with two other kinds of currants which Mr. Knowlton identified as R. hudsonianum and R. viscosissimum and two species of gooseberries which he doubtfully referred to R. rotundifolium and R. oxyacanthoides.

One or another of the foregoing species of Peucedanum is the plant called cows coivas or cowish and particularly described at no one of the above dates but at May 9 1806 p. 999 of my edition where I call it P. cous.
It appears as  cowweed  in the McVickar edition of the work.
Cymopterus campestris Nutt.
Mr. Meehan's suggested identification in a footnote.
April 29 1806.
On the Columbia at the mouth of Wallawalla River.
This is the shapelell or shappalell of L.  C. There is no mention of it at this date in the Journal but the name appears on April 14 1806 p. 949 of my edition.
Label only.

Camp Chopunnish and the Lo Lo Trail.
This record is quite right  but in enumerating the same species among plants of Fort Clatsop p. 835 of my edition I understand L.  C. to have been mistaken.
While at Quamash Flats June 10 1806 L.  C. speak of the honeysuckle bearing a white berry which Mr. Knowlton supposed to be Symphoricarpos racemosus and so I used the name on p. 1041 of my edition.
Lonicera involucrata Banks.

This fort was occupied November 1804April 1805.
Mr. Meehan says in speaking of the name  sacacommis  used for this plant by  Engages that it is not clear who Engages were but an engage was any hired man of a fur trading company  the word means precisely the same as employe or employee.
Mr. Meehan states that  Professor Knowlton in the notes to Coues' edition of the travels suggests the name Arctostaphylos pungens for this.
But I cannot find A. pungensin my book.
Sacacommis is given in four places p. 139 p. 674 p. 729 p. 827 in each instance correctly identified as the bearberry A. uraursi.
This is one of the few botanical identifications that I made myself as I happened to know the plant very well.

Dodecatheon meadia L. April 16 1806.
Rock Fort Camp on the Columbia.
In his footnote Mr. Meehan says   There might have been a specimen collected on the march up the Missouri in 1804 as in the Journal under date April 17th it is noted that ' violets doves foot and cowslips are in bloom' the Dodecatheon being probably referred to as cowslips.
But L. and C. were not on the voyage up the Missouri on April 14 1804  they did not start till May 14 1804 and at date of April 17 1804 there is not a word about cowslips in the Journal.
What Mr. Meehan means is a passage in the meteorological register kept by L. and C. at Camp Dubois at the mouth of Wood River which empties into the Mississippi in Illinois till the date of their departure.
The correct quotation for April 17 1804 is the violet dove'sfoot and cowslip are in blow p. 1283 of my edition.
Mr. Meehan's other citation of cowslip at date of April 9 1806 also found in the meteorological register p. 1295 of my edition is correctly referred to the Columbia River.

So also does Pursh's  on the Missouri Flats near the Rocky Mountains which reads curiously to one who knows the geography of the route.
It is wrong by several hundred miles  yet not so far out of the way as some others of his that I could instance.

Nothing is simpler than the geographical explanation of the apparent discrepancies in this identification and the three preceding ones.
The Bitterroot the Hellgate and the Big Blackfoot are three of the sources of Clark's River coming together in the vicinity of Missoula.
July 1st to 6th Lewis went down the Bitterroot to Missoula up the Hellgate to the Big Blackfoot and up the latter to within one day's march of Lewis and Clark's Pass of the Continental Divide.
As I have said before neither Lewis nor Clark ever saw Clark's River as understood by modern geographers.

This is impossible because Lewis was never on the Yellowstone though he passed its mouth twice  and at the date said he was on the Missouri above Maria's River at the Cracon du Nez or Grog Spring in the vicinity of Fort Benton.
Clark was on the Yellowstone at this date below the mouth of the Bighorn and above the mouth of Tongue River.

Quercus macrocarpa depressa Englm.
September 5 1801.. From the Niobrara River where L.  C. camped on the 4th not on the 5th upward.
The  White Point  Creek which Mr. Meehan cites in this connection is the White Paint Creek of L. and C now known as Bazile Creek which falls into the Missouri next below the Niobrara and on the same side.
The date on which L. and C. described this tree particularly is the 16th not 15th as cited by Mr. Meehan  they were then camped a short distance above White River one mile above their Corvus Creek now known as American Crow Creek.
This oak is the one malidentified by Mr. Knowlton in my edition p. 119 as Q. undulatavar.wrighti and first referred to Q. macrocarpa by Prof. Sargent Garden and Forest No.

Neither of the three botanists concerned in this case seem to know what sort of an onion it is.

Mr. Meehan speaks of this as the  hyacinth of Colorado Plains by slip of the pen for Columbia Plains.
The passage of L.  C. which he cites as from the Journal of April 16th occurs in the meteorological register of that date p. 1295 of my edition.
Mr. Knowlton imagined this hyacinth as mentioned by L.  C. on April 16th to be quamash and so it stands Camassia esculenta on p. 952 of my edition by egregious error.

Quamash flats on the Lo Lo Trail.
Pursh is far out with his  upper part of the Missouri  as the location of this specimen.
In citing the Journal of June 29 1806 for the blooming of this species Mr. Meehan means the meteorological register of that date p. 1297 of my edition.
It should be particularly noted that the Quamash flats of L.  C. of June 29th are not those of June 23d.
The latter are on Weippe Prairie near the west end of the Lo Lo Trail the former are near the east end of that trail on Quamash or Glade Creek also called Prairie and Takon Creek.
Both are in Idaho but over 100 miles apart.
I do not understand why Mr. Meehan or Messrs. Robinson and Greenman should use Camassia eseulenta as the technical name of this plant.
The first specific name being quamash Pursh 1814 and the first tenable generic name being Quamasia Rafinesque February 1818 the coupling of these as Quamasia quamash is the required name of the plant as first given by Mr. Coville Pr Biol.

LIST OF BATS COLLECTED BY DR. W. L. ABBOTT IN SIAM.
BY GERRIT S. MILLER JR. During the year 1896 Dr.'W.
L. Abbott made an extensive collection of mammals in the State of Trong Lower Siam a region whose fauna has hitherto been practically unknown.
The collection which Dr. Abbott has presented to the United States National Museum includes sixtyone bats all but six of which were sent to Washington in formalin.
Eleven species are represented.
Three of these prove to be new while several others are of special interest.
Considerable time must elapse before it will be possible to prepare a complete account of Dr. Abbott's Malayan collections.
Meanwhile it seems advisable to publish a list of the bats that he has thus far taken and the following is printed here by permission of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Ears.
 Ears about double length of muzzle laid forward they reach to anterior corner of eye.
General form of ear as in Cynoj' terus brachysoma see Dobson Monograph of the Asiatic Chiroptera p. 28 but projection at base of outer margin sharply angled instead of bluntly rounded.
Tip of conch rather narrowly rounded off.
A slight though distinct concavity in posterior border immediately below tip.
Rim of ear with a conspicuous whitish border about 1.5 mm.
wide near base and narrowing to a mere trace at tip but nevertheless continuous.
Area occupied by white border on anterior margin distinctly thickened.
Inner surface of ear conch with six indistinct cross ridges.
Basal third of ear furred externally the remainder naked inside and out except for a few hairs along anterior margin.

Fur and color.
 Throughout the body the fur is short and scant that on the middle of back only 6 mm.
in length.
In males it is distinctly longer on sides of neck 10 mm.
in type and in both sexes it is much shorter on throat and on sides of body this especially noticeable in females.
The fur of the body extends to middle of forearm both above and below but does not reach the membranes except in middle of uropatagium.
Propatagium thinly haired below through proximal half.
Wings with scattered hairs below along sides of body and behind forearm.
General color of two males skins burnt umber to a varying extent tinged with red and overlaid with olivaceus darker on crown of head and paler along middle of belly.
A female is paler throughout the general color more closely approaching the chestnut and russet of Ridgway.
Ears and membranes of dry specimens blackish the former edged with dirty yellowishwhite.
Metacarpals and phalanges of fingers varied with whitish which irregularly involves the membrane close to the bone.

319 General remarks.
 Cynopterus angulatus bears a strong resemblance to C. marginatum but is readily distinguishable by its considerably smaller size and by the form of the ear.
It is larger than C. brachysoma the only other known species with similarly formed ear and quite different in color.
This bat is represented in Dr. Abbott's collection by two skeletons three skins with skulls and six specimens in formalin.

One skin and ten specimens in formalin.
The form occuring in Trong differs considerably from the Hipposideros larvatus of Dobson and Blanford which is represented in the National Museum collection by two specimens in alcohol taken at Bhano Upper Burma by Fea.
As the type of Phyllorhina larvata Horsfield came from Java the probabilities are that if either of the mainland forms is referable to the typical subspecies it is the one inhabiting the southern half of the Malay Peninsula.
Assuming this to be the case the form of Hipposideros larvatus found in Assam and Upper Burma is unnamed.
As compared with the northern and better known form that from Trong is slightly smaller in general size.
The foot is disproportionately smaller and the ear 320 1898. is narrower in proportion to its length.
The skull is smaller and the teeth especially in the lower jaw are comparatively slender and weak.

Discoidal placenta about f inch in diameter.
While this bat is clearly not related to Megaderma lyra I am not satisfied that it is the M. spasma of Dobson and Blanford.
From the descriptions of the latter species it differs in the following characters  skull with small but evident postorbital processes more pronounced than in Dobson's figure of M. lyra  mesopterygoid fossa divided by a central longitudinal ridge in its anterior half only  first upper premolar very small and partly hidden by cingulum of second premolar which is almost or quite in contact with canine  inner basal cusp of upper canine indistinct  middle lower incisors trifid  posterior branch of tragus apparently longer  free upper part of nose leaf with very strongly convex sides and a deep constriction at base heart shaped supplemental leaf above nostrils barely reaching edge of principal leaf.

The genus Tylonycteris although currently united with Vespertilio   Vesperus  appears to be perfectly valid.
It may be defined as follows  Dental formula as in Vespertilio i  2  c   pm i  m iLz 3  32  skull very broad and flat with greatly reduced rostrum and no trace of sagittal crest ball of thumb and sole of foot provided with broad discshaped pads.
Four specimens from Buitenzorg Java agree in size with those from Trong but in color they are much lighter.
This difference may be due to alteration in color resulting from long immersion in alcohol.
The Javan specimens were collected by G. B. Ferrari and have been in the National Museum since 1890.
Scotophilia kuhli Leach.
An adult female and three young.
The genus represented by this bat is so closely related to the North American Nycticeius that it is doubtful whether the two can be regarded as distinct.
The characters pointed out by Dobson however appear to be of nearly as much importance as those separating Nycticeius and Rhoge'essa.
My otis muricola Hodgson.

Kerivoula minuta sp.
now Type.
 Adult  in alcohol No.
83547 Trong Lower Siam September 1896.
Collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott.
General characters.
 About the size of the Bornean Kerivoula pusilla Thomas 2 but with shorter ears feet and legs less hairy wings and more uniform coloration.
Upper incisors bicuspidate crowns of upper premolars with transverse diameter equal to or slightly greater than anteroposterior diameter.
Ears.
 The ears are relatively shorter than in K. hardwickii  laid forward they reach to nostril.
Anterior border extremely convex much more so than in K. hardwickii but probably about as in K. pusilla.
Posterior border with sub terminal concavity very shallow and close to tip of ear.
Tragus essentially as in K. hardwickii but with a distinct notch immediately above anterior base.
Membranes.
 Membranes very thin and delicate light brown with irregular pellucid mottling.
The specimen is in an excellent state of preservation so that this mottling of the membranes must be regarded as a normal character.
Wings essentially naked as in K. hardivickii uropatagium more hairy.
The fur of the body extends along the base of the wings in a very narrow line only  beyond this a few inconspicuous hairs are scattered over the area bounded externally by the line from elbow to knee.
Proximal half of interfemoral membrane rather thickly sprinkled with yellowish hairs which extend along the legs to feet.
Fur and color.
 Fur long and soft but not dense  that on middle of back about 10 mm.
in length.
Color ochraceus buff throughout scarcely paler on the belly the hairs of the back faintly tipped with rufous.
Except on the head and membranes the hairs are everywhere plumbeous at base.
Skull.
 Skull much smaller than that of K. hardwickii but with relatively broader and heavier rostrum.
Brain case much more inflated anteriorly than in K. hardwickii.
Teeth.
 Each upper incisor bicuspidate relatively smaller than in K. hardwickii  the outer separated from the canine by a distinct space.
First and second upper premolars subequal in all dimensions the transverse diameter of each equalling or slightly exceeding the antero posterior diameter.
Crowns of molars relatively narrower than in K. hardwickii.
Two inner lower incisors trifid and each considerably smaller than the unicuspid outer incisor.
Lower premolars essentially like those of the upper jaw.

General remarks.
 Kerivoula minuta is in no way closely related to K. hardivickii or to any of the species hitherto known from the mainland of Asia.
Its relationships are wholly with the small Bornean form recently described by Mr. Thomas as K. pusilla.
Dr. Abbott secured only one specimen of this species.
Emballonura peninsularis sp.
nor.
Type.
 Adult  in alcohol No.
83575 United States National Museum Trong Lower Siam November 1896.
Collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott.
General characters.
 In general appearance most like Emballonura vionticola Temminck one of the smaller members of the genus but in size slightly surpassing E. semicaudata Peale the largest species hitherto known.
Ears.
 Ears moderate  when laid forward they extend slightly beyond nostril.
Anterior margin straight from base over middle of eye to about middle whence it is faintly convex to slight concavity immediately below tip.
Tip very narrowly rounded off.
Posterior border concave immediately below tip then gently and evenly convex to faint notch opposite base of tragus after which it is more abruptly convex to base which is distinctly below line of lower lip.
Inner surface of conch with thirteen cross striations arising near posterior border and disappearing shortly beyond middle.
Tragus with anterior and posterior borders nearly parallel though on close inspection each is seen to be very faintly concave.
As a result the tragus is slightly narrower at mid height than at base or immediately below the bluntly rounded tip.
Whole periphery of tragus faintly crenulate.
A trace of a lobe on posterior margin just below level of anterior base.
Membranes.
 The membranes are full and ample but in no way peculiar.
Wings from ankles.
Uropatagium including tail to base of penultimate vertebra.
Distance from tip of tail to free edge of membrane considerably more than length of tail.
Upper surface of uropatagium thinly furred to line of tip of tail.
Lower surface of uropatagium rather thickly sprinkled with short hairs along veins except near legs.
Wings naked except where fur of body extends both above and below to line joining middle of humerus with lower third of femur.
Fur and color.
 Fur of middle of back about 11 mm.
in length.
Face and muzzle practically naked.
Fur of head covering basal third of ears.
Dorsal surface uniform dark sepia  under parts much paler very near the broccoli brown of Ridgway.
Hairs everywhere both above and below indistinctly whitish at base.
Muzzle ears and membranes blackish.
Feet.
 The feet are slender a little less than half as long as tibia and considerably more than half as long as calcar.
Calcar slender weak and illdefined 35 mm.
shorter than tibia terminating in a small lobe.
Skull.
 Skull thin and papery  muzzle about J as wide as brain case slightly inflated laterally and with a deep central longitudinal groove  postorbital processes long and very slender reaching almost to highest point of zygomata brain case strongly inflated posteriorly.
Measurements of two skulls No.

Teeth.
 The teeth are essentially as in the E. monticola of Dobson except that the first upper premolar is tightly wedged between the canine and second premolar and the first lower premolar is very much smaller than the second in cross section.
General remarks.
 Emballonura peninsitlaris needs comparison with only one species the E. monticola of Temminck.
4 I have seen no specimens from Java the type locality of this form but Tem4 Van der Hoeven's Tijdschrift voor Naturlijke Geschiedenis en Physiologie V p. 25 1838.
1898.
325 niinck's original description is so full that it furnishes a satisfactory basis for comparison.
In passing it may be remarked that the Philippine bat referred by Dobson to E. monticola
is probably a distinct species from either the Javan or peninsular forms as the discrepancies in measurements are too great to be the result of mere individual variation.
From E. monticola the peninsular form differs chiefly in its larger size forearm 4345 instead of 40 extent of wings about 280 instead of 215230 and longer tail see table of measurements.
None of the Trong specimens show the snuffcolored head and foreneck mentioned as occasionally occurring in E. monticola.
The fur of the ventral surface of the body is nearly as noticeably whitish at base as that of the back while in E. monticola it is said to be brown at base.
As shown in the table of measurements Emballonura peninsularis slightly exceeds E. semicaudata in size.
It is thus the largest known species of the genus.
Dr. Abbott secured seven specimens all of which were sent to the National Museum in formalin.
