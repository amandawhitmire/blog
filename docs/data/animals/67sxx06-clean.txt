THE GENUS GRYLLUS ORTHOPTERA AS FOUND IN AMERICA.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN AND MORGAN HEBARD.
To the systematic orthopterlst the crickets of the genus Gryllus have proven to be one of the greatest stumbHngblocks in the order.
This is true of the forms found in both hemispheres but this assertion has especial emphasis when the American forms alone are considered.
This is not due to a lack of study as Scudder and Blatchley have in recent years both endeavored to diagnose certain or all of at least the North American species using what might be called conventional morphological characters while Lutz approaching the subject from a biometric point of view concludes that species in an anyway natural sense do not exist in the genus in this skepticism representing the other extreme from Scudder who categorically defines a number of species.
The present authors have been unable in the past to approach the subject with sufficient material to enable them to do more than endeavor to assign certain of their series to various of the forms recognized by Scudder.
There has been constant and increasing difficulty in doing this as while some individuals would fit certain of the specific descriptions others would be found agreeing in various features with two or more of the specific diagnoses the sum total of almost any representation showing an endless complexity of the characters used to differentiate the numerous described forms.
The fact is quickly recognizable that almost all of the descriptions of these species were chiefly concerned with size coloration not color pattern venation in number of transverse oblique of Saussure veins in the male tegmen and number of branches of the mediastine vein in both sexes tegminal length degree of development of wings and ovipositor length.
Such factors have been found to be of minor importance or of no specific value whatsoever in certain other related genera and the natural uncertainty of the status of the American forms has led us to undertake a more searching study of these.
This work is based on all of the American material of the genus before us 1504 specimens.
The results explain to our complete satisfaction the reasons for the past confusion a summarj of which is given below.
The genus Gryllus is found in America everywhere from southern Canada to Patagonia.
Many forms are developed distinctive in appearance to different degrees but possessing in not a single instance valid and constant specific characters with the exception of Gryllus domesticus a distinctive introduced species.
The different manifestations of the only native American species Gryllus assimilis are in no case sufficiently differentiated or constant to be considered geographic races.
They constitute mere variations the adaptation of this exceedingly plastic species to local environmental conditions.
All are in varying degrees unstable. but certain geographic limits naturally bound the distribution of each thus desert adaptations such as those described as personatus and armatus are never found in the well watered portions of the continent nor is the tropical adaptation assimilis found in the extreme northern or southern portions of the range of the species.
This is of course explained by the fact that the environmental conditions producing these variants are not found over portions of the range of the species.
The work of Lutzhas already demonstrated the error of using length of tegmina wings and ovipositor as characters of specific importance in the genus Gryllus.
The mass of evidence upon these features in Lutz's paper is absolutely convincing from studies of other genera we have found such characters to be of minor importance generally throughout the Orthoptera.
Finding no other characters which could Avarrant specific distinctions in the mass of American material which he carefully bred and studied Lutz has however stated that all the forms of Gryllus are conspecific.
His examination of the series of females of the genus in the British Museum should have shown him the error of this opinion but he apparently confined his studies to the variations in organs of flight and ovipositor  Of these the personatus variant showing the maximum condition of desert adaptation constitutes the nearest approach to a geographic racial development.
No intergradation is to be found with the more northern variants or with the other desert adaptation armatus found also in the arid regions of the southwestern United States which latter appears to be derived from the northern variants various conditions of which are found in the higher mountains everywhere in the region under consideration.
The personatus variant however normally very pale in general coloration is found to be occasionally much darker and from along the Mexican border such specimens are before us showing the traiisition to and the tjqaical condition of the mexicanus variant.

 In length of ovipositor however variable different extremes are found for each distinct species.
For many species these differences may be negligible but for some species the maximum and minimum are very different.
Such features however can only be accm'ately ascertained after specific units have been located through the use of definite valid specific characters.

of Gryllus in the British Museum Lutz confined himself to biometric observations and failed to recognize the specific units involved.
The extremes of ovipositor length for this series showed a minimum of 5 mm. which is decidedly shorter than ever found in Gryllus assimilis 10.5 to 25.5 mm.
in material studied by him unquestionably referable to assimilis and in our present series 11.2 to 23.2 mm.
In most series of the species we find the great majority of specimens to show an ovipositor length measuring between 12.5 and 21.5 mm..
 Lutz also briefly discusses the genus Atlanticus in his paper where from a few specimens it is assumed that similar variations in length of ovipositor and caudal femora exist such variations demonstrating in his opinion the invalidity of the two species for which the names Atlanticus pachymerus and dorsnlis had been used.
This conclusion is without foundation as he totally overlooked the fact that independent of general bulk these two species are separable by excellent morphological characters.
Recent studies based upon examples of Atlanticus show that at least nine distinct specific units exist each showing some variation it is true in the length of the ovipositor and to a lesser degree of the caudal femora but the forms have excellent genital and other morphological characters each species being far less plastic than Gryllus assimilis.
This would be in part the explanation of Lutz's position regarding the Old World forms of Gryllus.
A deeper study than biometric measurements of two dimensions in these forms would have shown excellent morphological characters for a number of species.

Of the names which have been placed under this species by Saussure we find that verticalis of Serville unquestionably belongs under Miogryllus and there preoccupies both laplake and saussurei.
When compared with other distinct exotic species of the genus this insect is found to differ in the extremes of size relative proportions color pattern where this is' developed this feature being in the present species very frequently lost through intensive coloration and rarely through recessive coloration and form of the male titillatores.
In Gryllus domesticus hordigalensis and initratus the color pattern  See footnote 13. is in each wholly different.
Other species such as Gryllus desertus chinensis afer and serviUei show less striking features but exhibit a complex of characters which prove them to be distinctive forms worthy of specific rank.
It would be ill advised however to attempt detailed diagnoses of the exotic species except in a monographic study of the genus.
Specific Description.
 Size variable length ranging from 14 to 28.8 mm. form robust two general types are developed one particularly found in typical assimilis somewhat more robust and compact than the other which latter is the normal condition in the great majority of variants developed in the temperate regions.
Head slightly broader than pronotum except in a rare megacephalic condition in this there is no flattening of the face at the clypeal suture as found in megacephalic males of Miogryllus and to an even greater degree comprehending the entire face in males of several species of the genus Scapsipedus''.
Pronotum with proportionate length of disk somewhat variable but with this dimension usuallj' contained in the width about 1.4 times caudal margin of disk straight to distinctly bisinuate lateral lobes with ventral margin straight and horizontal or occasionally weakly declivent cephalad ventrocephalic and ventrocaudal angles rectangulate the former rather broadly rounded the latter more decidedly so the caudal portion of the lateral lobes is somewhat pressed inward particularly ventrad.
In length the tegmina vary from less than half to fully the abdominal length in some phases their apices are situated externolaterad though normally mesad.
The wangs are either developed as complete organs of flight though never to the extent found in the  These extremes are nearly equalled in two male specimens before us both of the scudderianus variant and both from Miami Florida length of body 14.5 and 28.
.5 pronotum 3.1 and 5.7 caudal femur 9.1 and 16 tegmen 9.3 and 17.9 wings concealed and 27 caudal width of pronotum 4.6 and 8.1 mm.
 It is with considerable surprise that we find material of Scapsipedus limbatus Saussure referable to the variety africanus if valid in material before us from Cuba and Jamaica.
The males are easily separable from those of Gryllus by the very peculiar head but the females are instead perfectly normal in this respect no dark form of Gryllus found in America however having the transverse yellow markings between the eyes found in the species of Scapsipedus.
In the present insect the males have a sharply defined band of this color between the oceUi while the females have an additional band just below between the ventral margins of the eyes and an elongate triangular mesal spot of the same color below the apex of which touches this latter band.
We mention this species here as females collected at some future time in the West Indies where the species has almost certainly been accidentally introduced from Africa by man might easily be confused with Gryllus.
The genus Scapsipedus is African and Oriental limbatus is described from Madagascar the variety africanus by inference from Africa.
species of Miogryllus or are greatly reduced though perfect and concealed by the tegmina when greatly reduced in Miogryllus the wings constitute small rounded flattened pads not folded as in the macropterous condition and may be termed vestigial rather than reduced.
The transverse veins of the male tegmina are normally 3 sometimes 4 particularly in some South American series where this number is the normal rarely 5 and very rarely 2 or 6 the speculum is broadly ovate liut somewhat variable in outline with normally a curved vein dividing it into nearly equal sections.
The number of branches of the mediastine vein is variable in the present species and useless as a specific character.
The caudal tibise have the dorsal margins armed normally with 6 or 7 heavy rigid spines the number of these spines is seldom 5 except in a very few series and very rarely 8 or more the distal spurs are 6 in number the medioexternal mediointernal and dorsointernal being decidedly the longest of which the mediointernal is normally slightly longer than the others equalling slightly more than k to f the length of the metatarsus.
The male titillatores are very different from those found in either Gryllus domesticus or Gryllus mitratus with which species we have alone been able to make this comparison.
This organ is found within the subgenital plate of the males of this group and constitutes the repository of a small globular seminal sac which rests upon the subgenital plate but is enveloped laterad and dorsad by the thin but corneous organ the parts of which afford the diagnostic features described below.
This corneous portion constitutes a thin complex plate semicircular in transverse section and composed of a mediodorsal and two lateral parts.
The first of these is produced mesad in an upcurved rather narrow triangular plate with margins weakly convex and with length nearly U times the basal Avidth.
The lateral nearly perpendicular portions are fused with this portion dorsoproximad and are produced in shorter narrow vertical and blunt projections inside of which from their proximal point of juncture with the dorsal portion extends on each side a single fingerlike projection which is also corneous and is slightly curved toward the apices of the lateral projections which it almost reaches.

The coloration and color pattern is discussed below under the treatment of the varietal developments.
 This is carefully discussed and figured by Lutz The Variation and Correlation of Certain Taxonomic Characters of Gryllus p. 8.
1908.
 In one specimen before us of the personatus variant the dorsal margins of the caudal tibise are irregularly armed with 10 and 12 spines.
Treatment of the Specific Variants.  order to place properly the material of this species examined we have found it quite impossible to group the specimens under any number of varietal units and in consequence we have devised a system of symbols as given below by which the coloration color pattern tegminal and wing development and size of each specimen recorded at the end of this treatment is defined.
We have found that in general certain types do predominate over certain regions.
These constitute the bases of many of the supposed species but in our opinion should be characterized by symbols rather than varietal names owing to their complexity and the evident fact that none of these are distinct either specifically or as geographic races and really show only the various phases resultant from varied environmental conditions.
In other widely distributed and plastic species we have found similar environmental adaptations but nowhere in the Orthoptera of America is this carried to the multiplicity and extreme diversity of such variants as in the present species.
Should varietal names be used without qualification for such units even for convenience the frequent and varied combinations of features already proven worthless for either specific or geographic racial cUstinction would preclude the possibility of proper use of even such names of minor importance for many specimens in every large series studied.

Much material is found not even to fit exactly any series of these symbols.
To overcome this difficulty a few qualifying remarks will often be added or two instead of one of a set of symbols given.
Thus a specimen recorded as AB or VX or 12 shows it to illustrate a condition intermediate between that signified by the two symbols of a single set given.
The most frequently encountered variants of Gryllus assimilis.
We would again caution the student that these variants are in no case fixed all manner of intermingling is found in large series and the use of names to designate such is not warranted as such use would on many occasions unquestionably result in conveying a false impression to subsequent workers.
C greatly suffused Z normally a or b u 012. assimilis Fabricius.
This variant is widely distributed throughout tropical humid America at low elevations and throughout the West Indies.
In the United States it appears only along the coast of extreme southern California.
Though many series are quite uniform for this plastic species specimens before us from Duran Ecuador show to varying degrees the cephalic color pattern found in the species.
Other names cubensis aztecus galapageius harretti.
D suffused Z normally d to f v 3 often weakly 0.
mexicanus Saussure. This variant is widely distributed over Mexico and Lower California it is the development toward an arid adaptation of the assimilis type and shows great variability.
In the United States occasional individuals show a tendency toward and a few specimens are typical of this condition in our series taken along the Mexican border of Texas.
In this variant the pronotum has the dorsum frequently' narrowly bordered laterad by pale yellowish.
Other name chichimecus.
EZ normally d to g u 2 often weakly 0.
personatus Uhler.This variant a desert adaptation in which the extreme of recessive coloration and most strongly defined color pattern is reached is known only from the United States from Kansas Colorado and central Texas westward.
Of all the variants of the species this one shows the most decided indications of a geographic race in process of evolution.
It is interesting to note that this variant averages decidedly heavier than the other desert adaptations of the species found in the southwestern United States.
Other name  Stal's much older name lineaticeps appears to represent a transition between this and the mexicanus variant.
A suffused Z normally d to g u 3. armatus Scudder.
In the same regions of the southwestern United States in which the personatus variant is found the present variant also occurs often very conspicuous on account of its dark head and pronotum which contrast strongly with the much paler remaining portions of the insect.
Great variability is shown in the series before us many differences being found in individuals of every large series but none showing any approach to the personatus variant.
Immature individuals of this variant might be mistaken for those of Miogryllus Uneatus they have however the abdomen broadly infuscated giving them a barred appearance while the spines of the dorsal margins of the caudal femora are rarely less than 6 in number in M. Uneatus normally 5 and the young of the same are more uniformly yellowish.
Other name alogus.
B suffused Z normally d or e w 2 usually weakly indicated 0.

It is an adaptation to arenaceous surroundings in these regions.
Immature individuals could easily be confused with those of Miogryllus verticalis but in that species the young are more regularly marked with darker colors and normally have 5 spines on each dorsal margin of the caudal femora.
Other names ruhens jirmus arenaceus.
AU normally ax 4. negledus Sc udder.
This is the darkest variant found in the present species the maximum development of the condition found also in the two following variants.
It is found in the northeastern portion of the insect's distribution ranging southward in the high Appalachians to northern Georgia and is known from the Piedmont Plateau only in Pennsylvania.
Much variability exists and every intergradation with the next two variants is often to be found in the same series.
AV normally a or b but ranging to f x but often u 3. pennsylvanicus Burmeister.
This is the dominant variant of the species in the well watered regions of temperate North America and is found southward to the Gulf coast of eastern Texas.
Great variability is exhibited and every intergradation with the variants termed negledus and luctuosus is to be found.
Other names nigra angustus.
AW normally d but ranging from a to f w but often u 3. luctuosus Serville.
This variant shows an intensification of the features of the last.
It is found throughout the lowlands of the southeastern United States and in the Middle West from Manitoba southward to the arid regiong.
It also exhibits great variability.
The maximum of this condition is found in material from the pine woods of the southeastern United States.
Other names abbreviatus.

This is an adaptation found in the mountains of the arid portions of the southwestern United States and also in California.
Extreme variability is to be found.

 This is the variant which the authors have previously consistently recorded as ruhens from the southeastern United States.
pennis appears to be an adaptation similar to the pennsylvanicus variant but heavier though no more compact with larger head under argeniinus appear to be described numerous adaptations though tyjjically suggesting the luduosus variant with tegmina f. Saussure's argeniinus variety c is however an adaptation similar to the personatus variant but with color pattern scarcely developed.
We have not referred to Walker's names here as the majority have already been proven synonyms and the descriptions are worthless.
We feel certain that the other described South American species have no further significance than the North American variants discussed above.
We have noted that in the mountains particularly those of arid or semiarid regions a degree of plasticity is found greater even than exhibited elsewhere by this most plastic species.
Several South American names are doubtless applicable to such manifestations of the species.
Females as a rule have the tegminal and femoral markings more decided than in the male sex thus frequently in the same series the males will show VWa while the females will average Wb.
As in our other recent papers the material collected by one or both of the authors is understood to be in The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia or Hebard Collection.

Europe in walls of houses.
The present species is readily distinguished from all manifestations of G. assimilis by its more slender form and distinctive color pattern.
The titillatores of the male are also distinctive and may be described as follows the corneous portion constitutes a thin plate semicircular in transverse section with distal margin weakly produced mesodorsad and broadly obtuseangulate with weakly concave 1 Recorded by Rehn as Gryllus argenlinus.
82 Ibid.
sides below the ventrolateral margins of this portion on each side rests a somewhat more thickened narrow corneous plate which is exteriorly nearly horizontal at the base but produced and upcurved with blunt apex reaching a little distad of the apex of the dorsal portion inside at the juncture with the dorsal portion this ventrolateral portion is strongly concave thus forming clawlike projections which hold in the seminal sac without pressing upon it at any point.
See Plate IV figs.
11 and 12.
The species has been accidentally introduced by man from Europe and is now widely distributed through temperate North America.
It has in the past been recorded from Montreal Quebec Connecticut New York New York New Brunswick New Jersey Ohio Lexington Kentucky West Terre Haute Indianapolis and Putnam County Indiana Moline and Urbana Illinois Minnesota and Omaha Nebraska.
The insect inhabits dwellings greenhouses etc. where it is sometimes found in large numbers.
The species is decidedly more alert and active than assimiUs in its movements more nearly resembling the extremely rapid Gryllodes sigillatus which tropical species also appears to prefer the proximity of man.
The series recorded below are in general coloration yellowish brown the specimens from Chicago Illinois and Albany Georgia are .slightly darker than normal with caudal femora weakly suffused.
Specimens Examined 27 7 males 14 females 2 immature males and 4 immature females.
