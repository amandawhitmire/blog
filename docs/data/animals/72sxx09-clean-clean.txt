RECORDS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF BRAZILIAN ORTHOPTERA.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN.
The records and descriptions in the present paper have been accumulating for approximately five years during the study of more representative regional series of Brazihan Orthoptera.
Aside from the geographic data here presented the taxonomic and variational information thus sifted out and here brought together is of very considerable value.
Two hundred and nineteen specimens are discussed representing one hundred and two species belonging to seventysix genera of which seventeen species and one genus are described as new.
In addition it has been necessary to give one new generic name.
The material treated belongs almost wholly to The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia the Hebard Collection which is on deposit at the Academy the United States National Museum the Museum of Comparative Zoology and Cornell University to the authorities of which institutions the author is indebted for the opportunity to study these collections.
These institutions are indicated through the following pages by their respective initials.

This specimen which is the first of the species recorded with exact locality fully agrees with the description except in a few features which appear to us to be matters of variation or interpretation.
The interspace between the eyes is exceptionally broad for the male sex but is not quite twice as wide as the depth of the eye  the intercalated area is represented by a slight but distinct fold while the supraanal plate is subbilobate instead of having its margin entire as described.
In every other respect the specimen is in exact accordance with the description and differs from the related azteca with which it has been compared in the differences given by the original describers.

The latter features is probably one which varies on account of the at most very delicate character of that area of the plate.

We have not been able to examine the original description of this species volume ten of the St. Petersburg Memoirs being lacking in our set of that pubhcation.
However the specimens before us accord with the interpretation of the species presented by Serville and Brunner and have the cephahc margin of the pronotum lined with fuscous and the costal margin of the tegmina without any contrasted pale edging.
The specimens previously recorded by us as this species from Yaguarasapa Paraguay and Misiones Argentina together wdth two other males now before us from Puerto Cantera X 1913 C. Schrottky and Alto Parana II 1914 C. Schrottky Paraguay belong to the form called siinilis by Serville.

the costal margin of the tegmina largely edged with the same.
Whether similis should be considered a distinct species or merely a chromatomorph of higuttata we cannot say at present an uncertainty shared with Brunner and Saussure but it is our opinion that tentatively at least it should be considered worthy of specific rank.
Aside from the color features the female appears to differ in the tegmina being longer than in higuttata and of sufficient length to cover half of the dorsum of the abdomen.
All the material we have referable to similis is of considerably larger size than that referred to higuttata also much surpassing the measurements given in both of the original descriptions but this we feel may je individual or geographic in character.

It is a well marked species characterized by lateral tegmina such as are found in Parahormetica but having strongly developed tarsal arolia as in Hormetica.
Its closest relationship is however not with verrucosa as stated by Scudder but with sahcincta Walker from which it differs in the tegmina being lateral instead of quadrate and attingent in the pronotal horseshoe being of relatively less area less pronounced and differently colored and in the pronotum being in general less compressed and less vaulted.
Both species have shining black abdomens margined laterad with ochraceous and the tegminal color similar.

It was a surprise as well as a pleasure to recognize this previously little known genus and species in the present collection.
The specimens fully agree with the original description and also after allowing for a certain degree of roughness in the drawing with the figure.
Our specimens are all slightly larger than the original measurements several appreciably so but it is evident there is considerable individual variation in this respect.
Superficially the present insect bears a considerable resemblance to the African Vatid genus Danuria .
and allied genera the form of the head and pronotum much suggesting that found in the Old World group but Euryderes is a true member of the Mantinae.
Its position however appears to be removed from Coptopteryx and near Photina than the location given it by Kirby in his Catalogue.
While distinctly aberrant in general features it would seem to us to fit more logically in a linear arrangement between Metriomantis and Photina.
The species was previously known only from the type locality.

MIOPTERYGINAE.
TRACHYMIOPTERYX new genus.
This genus is nearer to Pseudomiopteryx Saussure and Eumiopteryx GiglioTos than any others.
Its relationship to Pseudomiopteryx is much less intimate than that with Eumiopteryx and from the former the new genus can be immediately separated by the absence of a frontal spine and the angulation of the laterocephalic sections of the pronotal margins.
From Eumiopteryx its differencesare more subtle yet distinctly evident.
The basal outline form of the pronotum is much the same as in Eumiopteryx showing however a slight angulation to the expansion which is suggestive of that found in Pseiulomiopteryx but the dorsal surface has three pairs of pronounced tubercles  the vicinity of the transverse sulcus is strongly sellate the occipital outline is distinctly arcuate emarginate instead of subtruncate as in Eumiopteryx and the juxtaocular lobes aredecided and rectangulate the facial shield is deeper in proportion while the tegmina are more ample as in Pseudomiopteryx.
The present genus is apparently a type intermediate between thetwo genera with which it has been compared but sufficiently distinct to be generically recognized.

This specimen agrees quite well with the generic and specific descriptions although very slightly smaller than the original measurements for the sex.
The individual has been much damaged about the wings and the median and caudal limbs and in consequence certain venational features are not as clearly discernable as might be desired.
The genus is not far distant from Pseudomiopteryx and also close to the genus Trachymiopteryx above described.
The principal features of difference between the latter genus and Euiniopteryx are given under the diagnosis of Trachymiopteryx.

GiglioTos' recent reference of Miopteryx granadensis Saussure to a new genus Promiopteryx as its genotype is completely in error.
His procedure is completely nullified by the first the present author's fixation of the genotype of Miopteryx as M.
granadensis.''
GigHoTos was doubtless following Kirby's fixation of rustica as.
the genotype  but Kirby's fixation was made a number of months posterior to the indication of granadensis.
The name Promiopteryx is consequently a pure synonym of restricted Mioptenjx.
It is necessary therefore to have a new generic name for the genus called Miopteryx by GiglioTos and we are here proposing Cnephomaniis selecting as genotype the species described as Miopteryx fuscata by GiglioTos.

The species is a rather aberrant Musoniella showing in its pronotai form and type of head a tendency toward Eumusonia.

This species is a quite interesting one being on the borderland between the genus MusoniaPromusonia GigUoTos' and Musoniella GigHoTos but apparently nearer the former assemblage.
When compared with a St. Laurent cotype of Chopard's Mionyx fuscescens which is a member of the restricted genus Musonia and to which the new form is closely allied costalis is seen to differ most .strikingly in the deeper frontal shield the shorter and broader pronotum this showing Musoniella tendencies the strongly infuscate marginal field of the tegmina which has a strikingly marked pale line on the costal margin and in the infuscate proximal sections of the tranverse veins.
The apex of the abdomen is lacking in the specimens seen.
From surinama the genotype costalis is separated by a number of characters the shorter pronotum and bicolored tegmina with infuscate bases to the crossveins being sufficiently distinctive in costalis to separate readily the two forms.

A member of the section of the genus having produced and acute apices of the wings and related to 0. ruhicunda Stoll from the Guianas but differing from that species in the female sex in the less elongate pronotum more decidedly trigonal sectional form of the shaft of the same in the more produced laterad eyes in the somewhat narrower marginal field of the tegmina in the reduction in number and size of the hyaline areas of the discoidal field of the same in the more acute tegminal apices in the slightly more acuminate apices of the wings and in the relatively shorter median and caudal limbs.
We are unable to compare the male very satisfactorily with nibicunda owing to a lack of material of that sex of the older species and the rather poor character of the available descriptions and figures of the same.

Although the material examined by Redtenbacher was of the female sex and the type is a male the characters assigned by him are all those of the type except for relatively minor ones of the abdominal and limb coloration and these may be sexual features.
In the type the apex of the abdomen is solidly blackish without any indication of the lateral ferruginous and the marginal greenish mentioned by Redtenbacher.
The caudal tibiae in the type have the dorsal surface lined with ferruginous except proximad and distad where the general blackishcolor is found.
Redtenbacher says the tibiae are uniformly fuscousblack along with the tarsi.
The caudal tarsi are pale ferruginous in the type while those of the other limbs are as described by him.

U. S. N. M. This species or at least individuals which we feel compelled to refer to this species exhibits a most extraordinary amount of variation in structure and to a certain extent in coloration.
We have before us in addition to the specimens recorded above individuals of both sex from Sapucay Puerto Cantera and Alto Parana Paraguay and Misiones Argentina most of which already have been rreported.
These specimens show appreciable variation in the relative width of the head in the relative size of the ocelli in the relative length of the tegmina in the acuteness and degree of development of the tubercle of the tegmina and in the coloration of the wings and the limbs.
The anterior field of the wings may have the coloration strongly bicolored blackish and pea green or the ground color pale with the vicinity of the longitudinal veins lined with fuscous the posterior field of the wings may be unicolored infumate with the principal veins well lined while in the other extreme the greater portion of the field is pale with the distal section and part of the margin infumate the veins in the pale area noninfumate.
The limbs may be blackish or mummybrown.
At first examination it appears that two distinct species are present but when all the available material is examined it is found that there is only a partial correlation of these characters one male from Sapucay for instance being in every other way characteristic of one of the extremes analyzed above but having the broad head of the other extreme while the Peixe Boi individual is in most of its features intermediate between the two types.
The genitalic features of all of the specimens seem to be identical for the respective sexes.

Gahan's recently described P. fisherp is supposed to differ from horstokkii in the presence of triangular processes on the lateral sections of the metathorax but our material which fully agrees with the description and figure of horstokkii possesses the same structures yet differs from the description of fisheri in other features as the color of the ventral surface of the body and of the membranous section of the wings.
It is evident that either horstokkii possesses such appendages on the metathorax or the coloration given for certain areas which are as a rule of fairly fixed character varies in fisheri.
We feel that the first explanation is more likely the correct one in which conclusion we are strengthened by an examination of other inaterial of the genus.
The metathoracic processes are hidden from above in spread specimens and this may explain their oversight by previous workers.
This is the first Brazihan record of the species.

The present specimen agrees with Bruner's description of this interesting genus and species except that the caudal margin of the pronotal disk is arcuate instead of subangulate as described that the caudal tibiae have six instead of seven or eight spines on the external margin and the same tibiae are purplishglaucous instead of oilgreen as described.
These differences appear to us to be individual although future work may show the Goyaz and Chapada specimens to differ from one another in other unnoticed specific features.
For the present however it is best to consider them as representing the same species.

These specimens appear to us to represent the previously unknown female of this species.
Certain features of difference from the male type are very apparent but of these several are clearly sexual and the others are in all probability so.
There exists however a possibility that the Goyaz females may be specifically distinct from the type of sulcirostris.
The points of difference can be sunomarized as follows.
The fastigium is shorter and broader than in the type being distinctly shorter than the occiput the dorsal surface not sulcate and distinctly lower than the level of the occiput which latter is appreciably arcuate dorsad the frontal costa is broader less marked ventrad with the sulcation distinct dorsad and subobsolete 2 We feel that the correctness of this locality is open to question as all the material seen since the original description came from South America.

ventrad the fastigiofacial truncation is more rounded antennae much shorter and less strongly ensiform proximad.
The wings have the disk colored as in the male but the anterior field is hyaline instead of largely blackishbrown as it is continuously with the disk in the male.
The prosternal process rather curiously is unsymmetrical in both females Ireing transverse as in the male tut having the sinistral angle distinctly projecting in a moderately acute or subbulbous projection far more developed than the corresponding dextral angle.
The cerci of the female are very slender tapering nearly reaching the tip of the supraanal plate ovipositor valves elongate the dorsal pair greatly produced slightly more than twiceas long as the cerci and nearly twice as long as the ventral valves strongly compressed sublamellate unarmed tips blunt.
The fastigium and occiput bear a pair of fine llueblack lines which gradually diverge caudad these represented on the pronotum by paired diffuse mottlings of the same shade which color the punctations of the regions they cover the transverse sulci are lined with blueblack the impressed lines on the face and some of the punctations on the same blueblack dorsum of the abdomen broadly nopal red a narrow line on the ventral section of the external face of the caudal femora and the dorsal surface blueblack.

U. S. N. M. These specimens apparently represent the previously undescribed male of the species.
As far as can be determined from the ambisexual characters given in the original description our individuals are conspecific with the female described by Brunner.
The stridulating field of the male tegmina is elongate and relatively narrow bearing two very conspicuous ivorywhite subcircular areas surrounded and separated by a border of oxblood red.
The margin of the distodorsal abdominal segment is faintly arcuatoemarginate distad while the supraanal plate is of uncertain form being buried by the flexed cerci the latter are simple tapering deplanate distad .straight in the proximal twothirds then moderately arcuate inwards the apex blunt subgenital plate rather short narrowing distad with a distinct median carina the distal margin truncate with the lateral angle produced into distinct acute substyliform processes.

These specimens fully agree with the description of chapadensis which is certainly close to albida Brunner.
Just how it differs from the older species is not at all clear as the form of the supraanal plate of the male which is said in the original description of chapadensis to be the chief characteristic of the species shows no differences which would not be covered by Brunner's brief description of this area in albida.
The material from Sapucay Paraguay and Misiones Argentina which we had previously referred to albida we now know does not belong to that species but instead represents G. steinbachi Brunerj a species which at the time of our references was undescribed.
In consequence we do not know albida Brunner to which however chapadensis is very close.

A close relative of P. alliedea Caudell from Paraguay and P. cognata Rehn described below but particularly close in its relationship to the former.
 From alliedea the present species differs in its considerably smaller size more robust proximal portion of the caudal femora and the more bent shorter and blunter ovipositor.
The form of the latter strongly approaches that of the ovipositor of P. cognata but in proportions it would hold an intermediate position as the apex is more acute and the distodorsal section of the margin is by no means as coarsely spined as in cognata.

Head in general form similar to that of tenella fastigium faintly longer and more regularly narrowing than in tenella fastigium of the face as in teiiella median ocellus large face bullate to the same degree and laterally compressed in similar fashion to that of tenella palpi equally slender but slightly shorter than in tenella eyes in basal outline distinctly ovate the axis oblique antennae reaching at least as far as the tips of the tegmina.
Pronotum as in tenella except that the ventrocephahc angle of the margin of the lateral lobes is more obtuse and less rounded.
Tegmina very similar to those of tenella but the apex is slightly more sharply rounded.

In addition to the type we have before us two paratypic females which bear the same data as the type except that one was taken in the month of July instead of August.
These specimens show no noteworthy differences from the type.
One of the specimens has.
lost the cephalic femora and the other has but a single one  in this latter the femur has but a single spine on the ventrocephalic margin.
The ventroexternal margin of the caudal femora has the spines seven or eight in number of the ventrointernal margin six to eight in number.
These figures make the known variation in the formulae of these margins for the species six to nine and four to eight respectively.

U. S. N. M. These specimens show a great amount of size variation which appears to have some geographic correlation.
The Corumba specimens are of a uniformly medium size while the Rio Verde female is quite large and the Goyaz male the smallest individual of the species we have seen much smaller than a Sapucay male the only other individual of that sex at hand.
The tegmina of one Corumba individual are unmarked of another with a single small ocellar spot on the ulnar vein at the base of its first ramus and the third with a relative large greenishwhite ocellar spot in the same position.
The Rio Verde female has no tegminal spots and the Goyaz male is similar in this respect to the second Corumba individual mentioned above.
There is considerable variation in the relative width of the tegmina which is apparently individual in character.
The species is now known to range from the State of Goyaz west to at least Corumba south to Sapucay Paraguay and the Misiones Argentina.

U. S. N. M. This specimen fully agrees with the original description except for its faintly smaller size.
We feel that Bruner was not correct in placing this species in Topana as a careful comparison of it with the genotypes of Topana and Pycnopalpa shows more features of agreement with the latter than with the former.
The cingulate disk of the pronotum the form of the palpi the number of spines on the ventrocephalic margin of the cephalic femora the form of the stridulating field of the male tegmina and the color distribution at the base of the tegmina are as in Pycnopalpa while the tegminal venation and the nonerose character of the tegmina are as in Topana.
As the majority of the striking features accord with Pycnopalpa this association is clearly the more justifiable course to pursue although nibiginosa is a definite proof of the common origin of the two genera.

This specimen fully agrees with the original description of the species which can be distinguished from marcjinatus Walker by its smaller size its relatively straighter cephalic femora its slightly more compressed pronotum which has the marginal color contrast moderately decided and its less produced lateral angles of the mesoand metasternum.
The present species has the same type of mottled light and dark coloration of the sutural margin of the tegmina found in marginatus but as the general color is darker the pale areas are reduced in size and less conspicuous.
At first glance flavolimbatus might be taken for a small specimen of marginatus but the structural differences appear to be sufficiently marked to distinguish the two.

These specimens fully agree with the original description which was based on a single female.
Several features of the male sex are worthy of comment.
The stridulating field of the male tegmina occupies about onefourth of the sutural section of the tegmina.
The two disto dorsal abdominal segments are shining black as in the female sex.

This specimen is typical except that the proximal threefifths of the tegmina is green instead of ferruginous as described.
We know there is dichromatism in some of the Pterochrozae i. e. Mimetica and this is apparently a case of the same sort.
We have not used Serville's picturata for this species an action taken by Kirby as we do not feel convinced the older name was applied to the same species as Brunner 's angulatoocellaia .

This specimen shows a few differences from the description which was based on the female sex but these are chiefly in measurements and are probably due to sexual difference in proportions.
The development of the caudal section of the pronotum is exactly as de.scribed by Bolivar.
The species has been recorded from Rio de Janeiro Brazil and ''Province del Sara Bolivia by Bruner.
This measurement is unnaturally small as the abdomen is shrunken.

This specimen is somewhat larger than the measurements given by Redtenbacher but it does not appear to differ in other features.
From the closely related L. carinata Karny the present specimen differs as does the description of atrata in the longer and strongly arcuate process of the left mandible and the straight cerci.
The localities given above are all known for the species.

U. S. N. M. This specimen like the female from the same locality previously recorded by us has been immersed in alcohol or a similar preservative so that today its distinctive coloration is almost entirely lacking.
The caudal limbs and the cephalic and median ones on the left side are missing but all the important structural features of the species are evident.
The tegmina are longer than in any of the other males measured by us being but shghtly shorter 18.3 mm.
than those of the female from the same locality previously measured.

U. S. N. M. These specimens show no differences worthy of mention from the original description.
The disparity in size of the two faces of the foramina of the cephaUc tibiae is quite evident while in the measurements the female which is the sex of the type shows no noteworthy difference except that the tegmina are about one millimeter longer.
The male tegmina is narrow the greatest width of dorsal field contained two and onehalf times in the greatest length of the same.
Both of the present specimens are minus two to three legs and the coloration has been much affected in the male.
TRIGONIDIINAE Cyrtoxipha pernambucensis new species.
Plate XI fig.

1.
This species is a relative of C. gundlachi the genotype  from which it differs chiefly in the more deplanate head and more elongate eyes which in basal outline are more pyriform than reniform the head when seen from the cephalic aspect is much more strongly transverse and shallower in proportion to its depth than in gundlachi.
The pronotum of the male is shghtly less decidedly transverse with a more marked cephalic narrowing than in gundlachi while the tegmina of the male have the dorsal field shghtly narrower 284 in pernanibucensis than in gundlachi with the specuhim and the principal veins more longitudinal.
Most of the limbs are missing in the unique type of pernambucensis.
It is probable that the Pernambuco material referred to gundlachi by Saussure belongs to this species.

The only really noteworthy difference is that the caudal tibiae have five spines on the external and six on the internal dorsal margins instead of 55 or 43 as described.
This is apparently the first record of this magnificent species since the original description.

This species is referred to Nessa provisionally as it may prove to be generically distinct from the poorly known genus of Walker.
From the description of the genus Nessa and the genotypic N. linearis the new species differs in the pronotum being slightly broader than long in the ovipositor faintly surpassing the length of body and very much longer than the abdomen in the caudal tibiae having six external and seven internal spines on the dorsal margins in the  Proc.

Some affinity is shown to Parametrypa and some similarity to Cylindrogryllus and Tapinopiis is noted but from the former the new species differs chiefly in the femoral spination as well as the elongate and fully developed tegmina while the shorter pronotum elongate tegmina tibial and metatarsal spination and the abbreviate distal caudal tibial spurs are the more readily perceived features of difference from Cylmdrogryllus.
From Tapvnopiis the new form differs in the shorter head shorter and simpler pronotum the imperforate cephalic tibiae the short cephalic tarsi and the slender ovipositor which has the distal valves short and slender.

Stylifer Odostomia Acteocina One Hawaiian species Stylifer rohusfus was described by Mr. Pease.
The Hawaiian species referred to Scalenostoma apiculatuni Souv.
in a former paper' is perhaps a Stylifer or closely related thereto.
It is parasitic or commensal on Echinoderms.
Whether it is without an operculum like the typical Stylifers has not been noted.
Stylifer deformis Pease from the Paumotus resembles both of the Hawaiian forms from the Bryan collection without exactly matching them.
A series of four S. deormis including the figured type is in the collection of the Academy.
They show considerable variation in the degree and direction of curvature of the acuminate early whorls.

The shell is thin white.
The upper fourth is acuminate of about eight nearly flat smooth whorls.
The rest of the shell about 632 whorls tapers more rapidly the whorls increase slowly and almost regularly and are rather strongly convex and the surface is malleate having many spiral facets giving some appearance of having coarse low spiral threads on the last two whorls.
The last whorl is well rounded basally.
The aperture is ovate.
Columella is slightly concave.

has been discussed by Pease who described a var.
inflexa to which he referred Reeve's figure 118 of swainsoni.
I believe the figure was drawn from the latter species of which Pease's inflexa becomes a synonym.
It is rather common off the south coast of Oahu.
It differs from T. nitida and plicatella which are very closely allied by having fine spiral striae in the interstitial intervals.
The inner lip forms a raised ledge as in T. ntfida.
The color ascribed to T. swainsom by Deshayes and Reeve is that of faded beach shells.

In the Hawaiian shell the folds could not be called wide and the division of the whorls is well above the middle Reeve's figure of T. puncticulata evidently represents the type of T. peasei agreeing vith that and not with puncticulata in measurements.

Molokai Kainalu Hawaii Hilo.
The large typical form of this species is particularly abundant in Pearl Harbor and the adjacent fossil deposits.
In Honolulu it occurs on the Kewalo reef off the mud flats where considerable fresh water comes in and Melania mauiensis is abundant.
Probably typical M. creh istnaius occurs only where the sslH water is slightly diluted with fresh on open shores it is replaced by a small form.
The usual length of M. crehristriatus is from 25 to 35 mm.
So far as we know the only published figure is that in Bryan's Natural History of Hawaii.
A very thick form was found fossil at Waimanalo Oahu by Prof. Bryan.
On most of the open beaches a small form which may be called form mantima is found in abundance the length is 10 to 15 nmi.
Localities for this form follow mainly from the Bryan collection.

Congeria bryanae n. sp.
The shell is triangular very much inflated along the middle of its length the ventral side flattened and subtruncate the posterior and dorsal borders beyond the hinge broadly rounded.
Sculpture of very numerous radial riblets crossed by closer and narrower concentric threads which are more prominent in the intervals.
The color is green or yellow uniform or clouded in varying shades and tints often with some irregular maculation of brown or whitish and pale yellow with vinaceous or pink maculation The interior is whitish more or less tinted with the external colors.
The septum is small There are about 10 rather strong teeth in each valve between beaks and septum and a group of elongated crenulations at the posterior end of the hingeline.
The rest of the internal margin is delicately crenul'ate.
Length 6.5 width 4.3 diameter 5 mm.
