THE FOSSIL LAND SHELLS OF BERMUDA.'
BY ADDISON GULICK.
Last summer (1903).
through advantages offered by the new Biological Station in Bermuda, I was able to collect the shells on which this paper is based.
In the stud}^ of the material I owe much to Dr. H. A. Pilsbry, of the Academy of Xatural Sciences of Philadelphia.
It will be necessaiy in the discussion of the fossils to compare them with the species that are now native, in the looser sense, to the islands.
In drawing the line l^etween these and the snails supposed to have been brought by commerce, I shall follow Dr. Pilsbry 's latest paper on the ''Air-breathing ^lollusks of the Bermudas.
"^ I shall also rule out all the littoral species, including Truncatella, because the fossil beds were not situated where such shells could be expected.
The most unsatisfactory feature of work on Bcrmudian fossil land shells is the difficult}' in determining the ages of the various deposits.
The rock of Bermuda is exclusively solidified dunes of calcareous sand, and the soil is the rust-colored residue of the weathered rock.
In weathering, the surface of the rock becomes completely broken up into pockets and crevices packed with the earth.
It is estimated^ that every inch of earth must represent eight or nine feet of rock eroded, and thus when it is possil^le to judge of the average depth of soil formed over a deposit, that depth can be made an index of the age of the deposit.
Probably the oldest good fossiliferous deposit that I examined is collecting locality No.
807 (see Map No.
3j of the Bermuda Biological Station, at a hard-stone quarry on the west side of Knapton Hill, about midway between Hotel Frascati and "Devil's Hole."
At this point a layer of eight or ten inches of red earth containing shells was covered by an ancient dune.
The dune has become hard limestone, and its top has been eroded until now the red earth in its pockets must represent a layer averaging not less than six inched in thickness.
The series of Poecilozonites that we took from this bed is very incomplete, and the fossils of all the genera are poorly preserved, but notwithstanding this we are able to recognize at least eleven species and sub^ Contributions from the Bermuda Biological Station for Research, No.

These are enough to identify its fauna with that of another deposit, locahty No.
806 (see Map No.
2), where the shells are abundant and well preserved, but with no external evidence by which to estimate their age.
This locality is another hard-stone quarry, where the excavations have uncovered a number of crevices and a cavern of considerable size.
The shells are in stalagmitic conglomerate at the mouth of the cavern, and in the crevices, and also in the earth that fills certain of the pockets.
They may represent a considerable period of time, but there is no way to distinguish any difference in age.
Another deposit at the same locality as the one last mentioned is a horizontal band of slightly reddish rock about half-way up the face of the quarry, and from two to three inches thick.
This is part of the rock out of which the cave and pockets were eroded, so that the shells here are very much older than the others at No.
806; but here, again, there is no basis for a comparison with the date of No.
807.
The remains here are obscure casts of Poecilozonites circumfirmatiis and of what appear to be Vertigo and Carychium.
I collected from three other beds in this neighborhood what seem to represent the same formation as the pockets of No.
806.
The first of these, locality No.
814, is a newly opened quarry just south from Coney Island.
A red-earth pocket [here contained a fine series of Poecilozonites nelsoni, very large, but wanting the most extreme examples of both the elevated and the depressed variations.
There are also fossiliferous conglomerates in caverns at this quarry, but they are composed of gravel too fine to contain Poecilozonites nelsoni.
The best fossil specimens of Poecilozonites reinianus came from locality No.
815, near Harrington House.
They are noticeably larger than the recent specimens.
No.
816, near 815, but on the shore of Castle Harbor, has large numbers of Poecilozonites bermudensis zonatus and Poecilozonites reinianus, the former associated with Poecilozonites nelsoni in a conglomerate.
Bifidaria rupicola, found in the red earth of No.
806, may perhaps be an importation subsequent to the formation of No.
807, and Strobilops huhbardi, found at the same place, possibly may not have been a permanent resident; but we can safely assume that all the other species from the above localities belong to the epoch of the red-earth streak at No.
807.
The remaining three deposits from which I collected are clearly much more recent than No.
807.
These are in sand pits, in the nearly pure sand of partially solidified dunes.
None of them have any clear signs of red earth, either about them or overlying them.
The shells at these places are so perfectly preserved that even the term "semi-fossil" seems a misnomer for them.
Probably the sand preserves them by saturating the water with lime before it reaches them.
One of these shell deposits, locality No.
818, on the land of Mr. Benjamin Trott, in Tucker's Town, is only from 8 to 36 inches below the siu-face.
The P. nelsoni were mostly in the upper foot of the deposit, where the bank is thoroughly solidified by the rain ; but a few inches lower the sand is still loose enough to be scraped out with a strong hoe.
The two localities last to be mentioned, Nos.
808 and 809, are essentially ahke.
They face the Devonshire marshes on the northwest side — 808 near the north end and 809 close to the barracks.
The sand in these dunes appears to have drifted from near the present line of the north shore — a consideration which may yet give a clue to their age.
The following are my records of fossil and semi-fossil shells in these localities : Locality 807.

Dr. Pilsbry's conclusion, from the anatomy of Pcecilozonites, that the oldest importations to Bermuda came from continental America, is thus confirmed by a large maj ority of the fossil forms.
Bermuda, at the time of the No.
807 deposit, was characterized by not less than five genera of continental affinities, of which at least one had been resident long enough to have developed new generic characters and a respectable diversity of species.
The abundance of the individuals, too, and the size and variability of some of the species, seem to show that the island was not inhospital^le to continental genera at that epoch.
There were not only the large extinct species Pcecilozonites nelsoni and Pcecilozonites cupula, but larger varieties also of Pcecilozonites hermuclensis and * Species not peculiar to Bermuda.
* Species not peculiar to Bermuda.
Pcecilozonitcs reinianus than are now living.
The largest specimens even of Pcecilozonites circumfirmatus and Succinea hermudensis are among the fossils.
These snails must have found more food than there is now on the uncultivated ground.
There is also geologic evidence that they belonged to a more prosperous epoch than the present.
Prof. Heilprin reports that in excavations for one of the docks, specimens of Pcecilozonites nelsoni were brought up from a peat deposit at a depth of forty feet below water.
A rise of the land sufficient to put these shells ten feet above sea-level (see Map No.
1) would multiply the land area eight or ten times, changing it from a narrow ridge, hardly two miles wide at its widest, into an elliptical area, including, it is true, some large lagoons, but in all about ten miles across and more than twenty miles long.
A large, protected interior valley w^ould then receive the fertile soil that is now washed into the lagoon by every storm.
It would not surprise me if the deposits at locality 807 should be shown to date from the period of this Greater Bermuda, but a person need hardly wait for this proof before supposing that the indigenous contemporaries of Pcecilozonites nelsoni were also characteristic of Greater Bermuda.
In spite of their e\ddent prosperity, I do not think it could be proved that these snails lived under any densely shading vegetation.
The humidity at Bermuda makes such a shade less necessary for snails than it is in many places.
I have often seen Succinea hermudensis clinging to grass and to trunks of trees in such situations that I imagine an American summer day would have desiccated them.
The tract about Prospect Hill (No.
809) must have been desolate, unshaded land when the hills were growing dunes, yet the sand here (localities 808 and 809) contains numerous well-developed specimens and quite a variety of species.
These must either have lived where they are found, or else have been blown there from some place almost equally windswept.
The extinction of species that were able to prosper on those barren parts of the island seems to me a strange occurrence.
If, as I l^elieve is probable, the sand for these dunes came from near the present north shore, then the island must have had very nearly its present shape and size when these snails were alive.
Thus when the Greater Bermuda sank, the change seems to have set new dunes in motion across this section of the Lesser Bermuda; and Pcecilozonites zonatus, Carychium hermudense and Euconulus turhinatus not merely survived the subsidence, but even formed a considerable population on the parts of the remaining island that were most damaged by the changing conditions.
How many other species still survived in the less altered sections it is impossible to say.
It is hardly possible to prove that even the set of fossils from No.
806 belong to any earlier date.
Indeed we might draw an analogy between Bifidaria rupicola at No.
806, which may be one of the later arrivals, and Bifidaria servilis at No.
818 and Piipoides marginatus at No.
809, either of which we can hardly hesitate to treat as recent arrivals.
But however this may be, the sand-pit deposits are against the supposition that the Carychiwn and its hardier associates were exterminated merely by the increasing barrenness of the island.
We should be in a better position to discuss the other causes if we knew whether these species survived till after the West Indian arrivals had begun to take possession of the land.
The West Indies snails, especially Polygyra microdonta, of Bahama, are at present much the commonest of the ''native" snails, and it may be that their special fitness for the more barren land of the new Bermuda made them deadly competitors to the old species.
The newer formations at the west end of the islands, which I had not the time to visit, may perhaps be the ones in which to look for evidence on this question.

Shell rimate, minute, elliptical or bluntly pupiform, yellowishcorneous, faintly striate, of 5 rather convex whorls; the diameter through the body whorl not much greater than that through the whorl preceding.
A prominent, whitish, inflated ridge, appearing Hke a second peristome, occurs behind the peristome.
Aperture proportionately more contracted than that of V. ovata; set with a parietal, an angular and a columellar lamella; and with two palatal and a basal fold.
The palatal folds are prominent, the upper one slightly doubletopped, the lower one more immersed and entering spirally.
The parietal lamella is stout and blunt; the angular lamella smaller and thinner; the columellar lamella and the basal fold low and blunt.
Peristome rather thin, expanded, and notched opposite the upper palatal fold, as in V. ovata.

Shell almost regularly tapering, corneous-white, imperforate, finely striate; whorls about 5, increasing regularly, those of the spire very convex, with deep sutures.
Aperture quite obhque, obstructed by a small parietal and a very minute, deeply placed columellar lamella.
Peristome broadly expanded and refiexed, thickened within by a white callus, with a sHght groove on its front face, and developed inward to form a prominence slightly above the middle of the outer margin (near the position of the upper palatal fold in Bifidaria).

This species is very dissimilar to the slender Carychium jamaicense.
The shape of the aperture allies it more nearly to Carychium exiguum of North America, but its heavy peristome is quite its own.
It is one of the most abundant fossil species, occurring in the red earth of locaUties 806 and 807, and even in the sand that fills the larger shells in the sand pits.

The typical form of this species is, I suppose, the large, moderately elevated form.
This is represented among my specimens from locality 814, where the variation in dimensions is as follows: Alt.

28 37 27 41 27 40 26 35 25 39 23.5 36 23 41.5 23 (estimated) 35 The way these lay, piled together in a little pocket, compels the supposition that they lived at about the same time, and their variations in outline show what may occur in a single intergenerant colony.

31 33 19 37 19.5 39 I should like to suggest the name discoides, merely as a convenient term by which to know the variation represented by the last two shells (PI.
XXXVI, fig.
4).
I must say, however, that this suggestion would be unfortunate if it resulted in the division of the series obtained from locality 814.
It seems to me, rather, that some physiological peculiarity has destroyed the diagnostic value of the elevation of the spire.
The upper whorls differ less than the lower, and in the most elevated forms the suture of the later whorls is much below the keel of the preceding whorl, as if the slant of the spiral had been al^normally diverted downward.
Poecilozonites nelsoni var.

Shell smaller than the typical form, shiny, with heavy ribbed stria), colored with a broad yellowish-brown peripheral band on a white ground.
Whorls a trifle more than nine, increasing regularly and very gradually.
The suture does not change its character nor become deflected from the peripheral line of the preceding whorl.
The usual ])eripheral angle is almost obsolete.
The base has a stronger angle about the umbilical perforation than is usual in the species.
The peristome is greatly thickened on the inside from 1 mm.
at the suture to fully 2 mm.
near the columella.
A prominent callosity covers the parietal wall of the aperture.
Alt.

The combination of small size and large numl^er of whorls is characteristic.
The ratio of height to diameter is more constant than in the typical form, and the tendency to produce the callosity is very marked.
Type from locality 818, others from 818 and 807.
The stability of the variety, occurring as it docs in the oldest and the latest formations, is the most interesting thing about it.
It is also my excuse for regarding such slight distinctions in a reniarkal^ly \'ariable species.
I suppose the color patterns of Poecilozonites nelsoni were essentially the same as those on the living Poecilozonites bermudensis.
For example, the type specimen of collosus jirobalily had a dark lirown band on a background of a yellowish cuticular color.
The depressed specimen which is figured has traces of a subperipheral band, a supraperipheral line, and radial flaming above this fine.
This flamed pattern appears in several of the flat specimens.

Whorls 7|, a little convex, increasing slowly; tho last vaguely angulate at the periphery.
The aperture is somewhat quadrangular on account of the straight, vertical columella and the peripheral angle.

The type was selected as the best-preserved specimen, not as the most representative example.
The majority of the specimens have a more roimded base and periphery, giving the peristome a more oval contour.
The height of the shell and the absence of a keel distinguish it readily from P. bermudensis zonatus, and the very round dome and less angulate periphery separate it from immature specimens of nelsoni.

The first four whorls are translucent whitish.
Whorls 7^ ; all but the final whorl are flat as if keeled, that one has a blunt peripheral ridge, below which it is deeply rounded.
The aperture is quite oblique, round-lunate.
The peristome is simple, except at the columella, which it joins without an angle, but the colunaellar margin is reflexed, partly covering the perforation.

27 Another specimen has the height 10, diam.
7 mm., and is composed of 9 whorls.
It shows more of the brown and less of the white color.
The extreme variability of P. cupula leaves it debatable whether this may not be a dwarf race of that species.
No specimens of this form were found last summer, and it is through the courtesy of Dr. William H. Dall of the National Museum, that I am able to describe and figure it.
The specimens came to him without labels, so that we are left to conjecture their age.
The slender specimen is so glossy and brightly colored that Dr. Dall doubts whether it can be a fossil, but it seems to me the simpler hypothesis to suppose that it was preserved in the sand in the same manner as the type of P. nelsoni callosus, which it so closely resembles in color and polish.
The shell sand seems to be a complete protection from destructive agents.
On this hypothesis it had originally about the color of Pcecilozonites bermudensis.

The typical variety seems to be of recent origin.
It is distinguished from the fossil by a less rounded upper surface, less flattened apex, larger umbilical perforation, and usually smaller number of whorls.

This differs from the type of the species in possessing an almost uniformly curved upper contour line, an almost flat apex, and a more constricted umbihcus.

Thus the smallest adult is quite equal to the average recent shells.
A few selected specimens of the fossil and recent shells can hardly be distinguished.
Many of the fossils do not have the callosity.
Locality 816 has great quantities of these shells so firmly cemented together that most of them are worthless as specimens.
They have the peculiar spheroidal upper surface, but the perforation is wider than in the series from locality 808 — not so wide, however, as in the recent.
Several specimens here occur below some fragments of Poecilozonites nelsoni in stalagmite, apparently showing that they were there previous to the extinction of nelsoni.
Broken and immature specimens from locality 808 show that the umbilicus was not much narrower than that of the recent variety imtil the last whorl had commenced to grow.
The peculiar contour is also less noticeable prior to the last whorl.
Thus in their smaller number of whorls, their less rounded contour, and their larger umbihcus, the present snails seem like an imdeveloped or degenerate race of the former species.
It is possible that this fossil variety is what Pfeiffer {Monographia, I, p. 80) mistook for Helix ochrolcuca Fer.

The modern variety comes from both formations at locaUty 806, and from 814 and 808.
Those from locahty 808 are some of them more keeled than is now usual.
A series of poor specimens from No.

discrepans.
This species has lost less in size than the others of its genus.

I think the fossils average larger than the adults of the recent shells, but it is not easy to eliminate the immature of either.

If this were the only locality that yielded the variety it would undoubtedly rank as a distinct species.
I should like to raise the question wdiether Poecilozonites discrepans is not one of the extinct varieties.
I believe it has not been treated as such heretofore, but none were foimd last summer any more recent than those from this sand pit.

Shell acutely conic, with contour very slightly convex; minutely perforate, thin, glistening yellowish-corneous, closely striate, and sculptured with microscopic spirals.
Apex rounded off abruptly.
Whorls 7^, not convex, narrow, the last strongly angulate at the periphery.
Suture simple, hardly impressed.
Base rather flat, not excavated.
Aperture almost quadrangular, but with the angle at the columella indefinite.
Columella slightly curved, the columellar margin narrowly reflexed.

The above description is a composite.
The general form is described from the specimen from locality 807, but the sculpture is that of the best specimen from 806, which should, perhaps, be considered the type, and the base and aperture are taken from the specimen from 808.
From 814 comes the longitudinal section of one 3.8 x 2.8 mm., with an unusually convex contour.
The genus Euconuhis is, of course, not wholly satisfactory for this species.

Shell resembling Zonitoides minusculus in general form, but much smaller, only moderately umbilicate, white, costulate, and densely sculptured with spiral lines ; composed of 3 convex whorls.
Apex somewhat elevated.
Aperture lunate, the outer and basal margin more imiformly curved than in Zonitoides minusculus, and the preceding whorl cutting out a greater arc.
Peristome simple, thin.
Costulse regularly spaced, coinciding with growth lines.
The spaces between them crowded with fine striae.
A close, regular, spiral sculpturing crosses these lines and gives the costulse a slightly tubercular appearance.

In the absence of alcohohc specimens of S. barbadensis I have given up that name and returned provisionally to the name bermudensis.
Its presence as a fossil makes it not unlikely that it may be proved distinct from S. barbadensis.
This is another species that was formerly larger than now.

If this species were indigenous we could expect it to be as abundant formerly as it is now.
Instead of that it seems to be entirely absent from the beds I examined.
The evidence seems to me strong that its real home is elsewhere.

The name Macrotus Leach {Syst.

— Head long; muzzle conical; nose-leaf simple, erect, lanceolate; nose-pad rounded; nostrils elongate, distinct: lower lip wdth a triangular pad bearing a longitudinal groove; ears large, imited; tragus lanceolate; uropatagium large; tail long, projecting somewhat beyond the posterior margin of the uropatagium, which completely envelopes it but the free apex; calcanea short and stout.
Skull with the rostrum moderately long, considerably lower than the brain-case.
Dentition i.
^^, c. ^, p. I^g, m. ^^.
Median upper incisors chisel-shaped, long; lateral upper incisors w^eak.
Distribution.
— Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica and a number of the Bahama Islands; Guatemala north to southern California and Arizona, but apparently not reaching the east coast of the mainland except in Yucatan.
History.
— ^The genus Macrotus was founded by Gray on M. waterhousii from Haiti, and referred by him to the Phyllostomina close to the genus Macrophyllum.
Wagner, in the supplement to Schreber's monumental work, placed Gray's genus in the Megadermota with Megaderma, Rhinopoma, Nycteris and Nyctophilus.
In 1858 Baird described the Californian M. californicus, and, probably following Wagner, considered the genus a member of the subfamily Megadermota.
Saussure, in 1860, in describing the Mexican M. mexicanus, referred the genus to the group Phyllostomides, but Harrison Allen, in 1864, followed Wagner and Baird, and considered it a member of the Megadermatida;.
Gundlach, in 1864, separated the small Cuban type as M. minor, while Peters, in 1865, considered the genus a member of his group Vampyri.
Coues and Yarrow, in 1875, placed the genus in the family Phyllostomatidce, in the section Vampyri, of which Dobson later placed it.
In both of these papers M. californicus, mexicanus and waterhousii were considered identical.
On the basis of several specimens from Guatemala, Dobson separated a species which he called M. hocourtianus.
Harrison Allen, in 1890, separated a form of the genus from the State of Jahsco, Mexico, as M. hullcri, comparing it with M. californicus; the same author, in the 1894 edition of his Monograph, defended his statement made in 1864, that Af .
californicus was distinct from the West Indian waterhousii.
Lyddeker, in 1891, believing that the name Macrotis Dejean invahdated Macrotus Gray, proposed the name Otopterus to replace Gray's term.
This action was criticised later by True and Harrison Allen, who held that Macrotis was little used and in construction differed from Macrotus.
General Relations.
— As little satisfactory material of the alhed genera is available, no critical remarks as to the relationship of the genu?
can be made.
It is without doubt a member of the present Phyllostomatinos, but that it is not worthy of separation from some of the types of this division is not so certain.
The genus Lonchorhina does not appear to the author to be as close an ally as Dobson's work would lead one to suppose; and taking the allied genera broadly, Macrotus appears to be a very distinct type, not differentiated as strongly by skull characters as by some external developments.

; greatest zygomatic width 12.3 ; interorbital width 4.9 ; height at base of second premolar 4 ; height of brain-case 9.3; breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 10; width of palatal constriction 2.3; length of palate from anterior foramina 11 ; width of palate including teeth 8.1 ; greatest length of mandible 17.3.
Remarks.— True M. waterhousii can readily be distinguished by the character given in the key.
From the mainland forms the heavier posterior limbs and the stronger skull and teeth will distinguish it.
From tv.
minor the Haitian form can readilj^ be separated by the paler coloration as well as the much greater size; from iv.
jamaicensis by the larger size and heavier teeth; from w. compressus by the broader rostrum as w^ell as the subquadrate first lower premolar.
Specimens Examined.
— One skin and skull : San Domingo City, San mingo.

Distribution.
— The island of Jamaica, where according to Gosse {vide supra) it is one of the commonest bats.
Osborn, in Dobson (vide supra), states that "when inhabiting houses these bats always live in the cellars below ground, they are never found in the roofs."
General Characters.
— Similar to the Haitian M. waterhousii, but differing in the duller coloration, the smaller skull and narrower and weaker upper tooth-row.
Head.
— Ear quite large, much as in M. waterhousii, but the size is greater, and the transverse pHcse more distinct ;connecting membrane rather high and with a distinct central emargination ; tragus as in M. toaterhousii, but the apex is blunter.
Nose-leaf and nose-pad broad, the leaf acuminate with the apex rather broad and blmit.
Lower hp with the pad trigonal, the median cleft deep and very distinct.
Limbs.
— The forearm and tibia are structurally as in M. waterhousii, but of sHghtly larger size; the thumb and foot are, on the other hand, of smaller size.
Calcanea short and stout.
Tail distinctly projecting beyond the interfemoral membrane.
Fur.
— Essentially as in M. waterhousii.
2 This is hardly visible in the type skin, but quite distinct in alcoholic specimens.
Color.
— Above Prout's bro^^^l, the hair with sUghtly more than the basal half white.
Below between drab and wood brown, the hair with the basal half white.
Ears and uropatagium Front's bro^Ti, endopatagium, mesopatagium and the greater portion of the ectopatagium clove brown.
Skull.
— Siinilar to that of M. icaterhousii, but slightly smaller.
Teeth.
— Similar to M. icaterhousii, but narrower and not strongly crowded ; second upper premolar separated from the first premolar by a distinct space.
Measurements.
— Type: Total length 90.2 mm.
; head and body 63.2; ear 23; greatest width of ear 16; tragus 8.5; forearm 54.5; thumb 14.1; third digit 92; tibia 23.5; foot 13; tail 27.
Average of series: Total length [10] 93.8 mm.
(90.2-103); head and body [10] 60.6 (57-67) ; head [9] 26 (25.5-27.5) ; ear [10] 26.3 (23-29) ; greatest width of ear [10] 18.5 (16-20.5); tragus [10] 8.8 (8-9.5); forearm [10] 53.4 (52-54.5); thumb [10] 13.4 (12-15); third digit [10] 90.3 (88-94); tibia [10] 22.3 (21.5-24); calcaneum [9] 10.4 (9.2-12); foot [10] 13.6 (12.2-16); tail [10] 33.1 (27-36).

; interorbital width 4.3; height at base of second premolar 4.1 ; breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 9.5; width of palatal constriction 2.4; length of palate 11; width of palate including teeth 7.8; greatest length of mandible 16.5.
Average of three skulls : Total length [2] 24.3 mm.
(24.2-24.5) ; greatest zygomatic width 12 (12-12.2); interorbital width 4.2 (4.1-4.3); height at base of second premolar 3.9 (3.7-4.1); height of brain-case [2] 9 (9-9.1); breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 9.4 (9.4-9.5); width of palatal constriction 2.2 (2.1-2.4) ; length of palate 9.9 (9.3-11) ; width of palate with teeth 7.9 (7.8-8) ; greatest length of mandible 16.1 (16-16.5).
Remarks.
— This form rec|uires comparison with but one other, true M. waterhousii, from which the compressed and spaced tooth-row will readily distinguish it.
The external characters are also of service, the longer forearm and tibia and smaller foot being distinctive.
From M. ID.
compressus and minor the characters given in the key will enable one to separate it without difficulty.
Specimens Exa?nined.

Collected by S. H. Derickson.
Distrihution.
— Specimens have been examined from Eleuthera, New Providence, I.ong Island and Conch Sound, Andros, Bahamas.
General Characters.
— Similar to Macrotus waterhousii and M. w. jamaicensis, but differing in the quite narrow rostrum (which is anteriorly narrower than the interorbital region) and elongate-elliptical first lower premolar.
Head.
— Similar to M. w. jamaicensis, except that the nose-leaf and nose-pad appear to be slightly narrower and slenderer.
This character appears to be only an average one, however, as the series shows considerable variation.
Limbs.
— Similar to M. u\ jamaicensis, l^ut the forearm, tibia, third digit and tail average smaller, while the foot averages larger.
In the latter respect compressus approaches true waterhousii, as their respective distribution would lead one to suppose, from which the limbs show practically no differential characters.
Fur.
— Essentially as in M. waterhousii and M. w. compressus.
Color.
— Above Front's brown, the hair with more than the basal half white ; fur at the base of ears and along the internal margins whitish.
Below the hair is white basally, ringed with pale drab, and tipped with silvery -white.
Membranes sepia, the ears and uropatagium paler than the other portions.
Skull.
— Similar to that of M. w. jamaicensis, but with the anterior portion of the rostrum narrower than the interorbital region.
The skull of true waterhousii can readily be separated, as it is of considerably greater size.
The mandible is also seen to be slenderer than in either the Haitian or Jamaican form.
Teeth.
— Similar to M. w. jamaicensis, but with the first upper premolar narrower and more elongate, and the first lower premolar is distinctly elongate-elliptical in basal outline instead of subquadrate.
The teeth are distinctly weaker than in M. ivaterhousii, the latter having a very heavy robust dentition.
Measurements.
— Type: Total length 94 mm.
; head and body 69; ear 24; greatest width of ear 18; tragus 8.5; forearm 52; thumb 13.5; third digit 85; tibia 21; calcaneum 11; foot 13; tail 25 Average of series : Total length [8] 96.7 mm.
(88-98) ; head and body [8] 64.5 (59-69) ; head [4] 25 (24-26) ; ear [8] 26 (23-29.5) ; greatest width of ear [8] 18.8 (17-21.5) ; tragus [8] 8.9 (7.5-10) ; forearm [8] 52.1 (49.5-54); thumb [7] 13.9 (12.8-16); third digit [7] 88.7 (84-106); tibia [7] 21.2 (20-23.5); calcaneiim [7] 10.4 (9.3-11); foot [8] 14.4 (13-16.8); tail [8] 30.9 (25-33.5).
Skull of type: Total length 25 mm.
; greatest zygomatic width 10.6; interorbital 4.3; height at base of second premolar 4.1 ; height of braincase 8.6; breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 8.5; width'of palatal constriction 2.3; length of palate 1 1 ; width of palate (including teeth) 7.6; greatest length of mandible^ 17.
Average of four skulls: Total length 25 rnm.
(25-25.1); greatest.
zygomatic width 11.6 (10.6-12); interorbital width 4.3 (4.2-4.5),height at base of second premolar 4 (4-4.1); height of brain-case 8.3 (8-8.6); breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 9 (8.5-9.5);: width of palatal constriction 2.2 (2.1-2.3); length of palate 10.6(10.5-11); width of palate (including teeth) 7.5 (7.5-7.6); greatest length of mandible 16.9 (16.8-17).
Remarks.
— The Bahaman form in general appearances approaches closer to true waterhousii than to w. jamaicensis, but the skull and teeth are decidedly different from the Haitian type and approach the Jamaican form.
Taken as a whole, however, the Bahaman race is quite distinct from any other form of the genus.
Specimens Examined.
— Nine ; five skins, four alcoholic specimens.

Type Locality.
— Cuba.
From remarks made by Gundlach in a later paper {vide supra) we learn that his material was from western Cuba.
Distribution.
— Cuba and the Isle of Pines.
Gundlach says it is a common species in some warehouses and caves, where individuals pass the day side by side suspended by the hind limbs.
General Characters.
— A member of the Macrotus icaterhousii group but readily separated by the smaller size and the deeper coloration.
The Cuban form is such a distinct type, with small light skull and weak teeth, that it hardly requires comparison.

(U. S. N. M.) ^hree.
(U. S. N. M.) One.
(U. S. N. M.) Head.
— Essentially as in M. ivaterhousii jamaicensis.
Limbs.
— As in M. iv.
jamaicensis, but slightly smaller.
Fur.
— As in the other forms of the ivaterhousii group, except that the furring of the base and proximal part of the internal margin of the ear is more marked than in any other form.
Color.
— Apparently two extreme types of coloration exist in this form, which may be sexual, l)ut the available material is not in condition to justify any statement beyond the fact that the two phases exist.
The one extreme is a deep browni, while the other (represented by but one skin) is a rather dark ferruginous.
Two specimens have a slight tendency toward the ferruginous type, the upper surface being slightly suffused with that tint while the lower surface is that of the browm form.
Brown phase: Above seal brown, the hair with slightly more than the basal half white, region l^etween the ears and posterior to the connecting membrane blackish; below the hair is wliite basally, then conspicuously annulate with drab and rather obscurely tipped with silvery; membranes blackish-brown.
This type is distinctly darker, both above and below, than anj' of the other West Indian forms.
Red phase : Above and below dull ferruginous, the hair unicolor ; patch between the ears blackish ; memJDranes black.
In one of the apparently intermediate specimens mentioned above, the hair of the upper surface is whitish basallj^ with a median annulation of smoke gra3\ Skull.
— Of the general type of M. iraterhousii, but distinctly smaller than any of the related forms.
As specimens from the eastern part ofpuba approximate slightly toward the Jamaican type, a slight difference in size is noticed in comparing the skulls of individuals from the two extremes of the island.
Teeth.
— Essentially as in M. w. jamaicensis, but the first upper premolar is slightly narrower and the lower premolars are distinctly more longitudinal and compressed.
This latter character alone will immediately demonstrate the fact that while specimens from the eastern part of the island slightly approach jamaicensis, theyjare inseparable from typical minor from western Cuba, when the dentition is considered.
Measurements.
— Average of twelve specimens: Total length 90.7 mm.
(84.5-96.5); head and body 59.9 (55.5-65); head 25.1 (25-30); ear 26.3 (21.5-30); greatest width of ear 17.3 (15-19); tragus 8.6 (7.8-10) ; forearm 51.4 (49-54); thumb 14.1 (12.5-15); third digit 85.1 (81-88); tibia 21.2 (19-22.5); calcaneum 10.9 (8.5-12.3); foot 13 (10.5-15.5); tail 30 (20-37).
Average of five skulls: Total length 23.8 mm.
(23.5-24.3); greatest zygomatic width 11.3 (11-12); interorbital width 3.9 (3.5-4.1); height at base of second premolar 3.8 (3.5-4) ; height of brain-case 8.3 (8-8.8) ; breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 9.1 (9-9.2); width of palatal constriction 2.1 (2-2.2); length of palate 9.7 (9.2-10); width of palate (including teeth) 7.3 (7-8); greatest length of mandible 15.4 (15-16).
Remarks.
— The Cuban form minor is quite distinct from any of the related forms except the Jamaican Macrotus waterhousii jamaicensis.
The specimens from eastern Cuba somewhat approach this latter race, as already noticed by Gundlach {vide supra), but the general characters of the race are retained and the smaller size and weaker teeth, as well as the deeper coloration, will serve to distinguish the two races.

Tail rather long, one or one and a half terminal joints free.
Membranes and Fur.
— Essentially as in the waterhousii group.
Color.
— Two color phases are present in the series examined — one dark brown the other of a more rufescent type — between which two extremes arc a number of intermediate specimens.
Dark browTi phase : Above bistre with a slight overlying silvery ''bloom," the basal threefifths of the hair white; below wood brown, the hair Avith the basal section as above, the whole with the tips of the hair white; hair at the base of the ears and the auricular hairs whitish; membranes bistre.
Rufous brown phase: Above cinnamon, slightly more than the basal half of the hair white ; below the hair white basally, then ringed with cinnamon, and tipped with ecru drab, thus producing a paler color than that of the upper surface ; hair at the base of the ears and auricular hairs whitish; membranes mummy brown.
Skull.
— Similar to M. ivaterhousri, but slightly smaller, with the interorbital region more depressed and the rostrum slightly slenderer.
Teeth.
— As in ilf.
waterhousii.
except that the canines are distinctly weaker, the first upper premolar is more compressed, the second upper premolar slightly longer, and the lower tooth-row more compressed.
Measurements.
— Average of four Cuernavaca specimens: Total length 93.1 mm.
(87-101); head and body 59.8 (56.5-64); head 24; ear 25.2 (24-27); greatest width of ear 17.7 (17-18.5); tragus 9.2 (9-9.6); forearm 49.6 (47.5-51.5); thumb 12.5 (11.5-13); third digit 87.1 (85.5-90); tibia 21.2 (21-21.5); calcaneum 10.3 (9-11.3); foot 12.7 (11.8-13); tail 33.5 (30-37).
Average of eight Tehuantepec skins : Total length [1] 100.5 mm.
; head and body 60.9 (57-69) ; head [1] 29.2; ear 26 (24-28.5) ; greatest width of ear [3] 18.8 (17.9-19.5); tragus 8.5 (8-10); forearm 52.5 (51-53.5); thumb [7] 12.3 (12-13.5); third digit [5] 87.8 (87-89); tibia 22.2 (20-23.5); calcaneum 10 (9-11); foot 13.1 (13-13.5); tail [1] 31.5.

Remarks.
— The Macrotus mexicanus group is closely related to the West Indian waterhousii group, from which, however, it can be distinguished by the characters mentioned above.
The slenderer build, larger ears and lighter skull will at once separate M. calif ornicus from this form, while the race bulleri is a smaller type of the viexicanus character quite easily recognized.
Dobson's Macrotus bocourtianus is, no doubt, simply the extreme development of this form, and his measurements are almost identical with those of the type of mexicanus given by Saussure.
Specimens from Tehuantepec average larger than ]\Iorelos specimens, but some specimens in the same series are smaller than Cuernavaca individuals, and as no other characters appear to be at variance, they should be considered extreme mexicanus.
]\Iany of Dobson's measurements of bocourtianus are smaller than the average of four Cuernavaca specimens examined, and in several cases are actually smaller than the same measurements of Saussure's type.

Type Locality.
— Bolahos, Jalisco, Mexico.
Distribution.
— From Guadalajara north to Durango and southern Chihuahua, also including the Tres Marias Islands.
General Characters.
— Similar to M. mexicamis.
but smaller, with the dentition more crowded, and the second upper premolar shorter and somewhat weaker.
Head.
— As in M. mexicamis, except that the ears are larger.
Limbs.
— As in M. mexicanus, but rather slenderer, the foot and calcaneum distinctly weaker.
Membranes and Fur.
— As in M. jnexicanus.
Color.
— This race occurs in two phases, one of which appears to be that of immaturit}'.
The dark brown type, which is apparently the immature coloration, is connected by intermediates with the dull rufescent brown type.
Brown phase: Above bistre, the hair with the basal half white; base of ears and auricular hairs whitish; below drab, the hair white at the base and tipped with silvery-white ; membranes clove brown.
Red phase : Above between chestnut and hazel (Ridgway's Nomenclature of Colors, pi.
iv), the hair light and rather vinaceous basally ; base of ears and auricular hairs of the under color of the upper surface; below dull pinkish vinaceous; membranes between chestnut and liver brown.
The intermediate specimens have the upper surface cinnamon rufous, while of this type has the extreme base of the hair smoke-gray, thus making the hair triannulate^ — smoke gray, white and cinnamon rufous.
The original series of this race was composed entirely of immature individuals and accordingly all are of the dark brown type.
Skull.
— Very similar to that of M. mexicanus, but distinctly smaller.
with the rostrum, for its size, heavier.
Teeth.
— As in il/.
mexicanus, but the second upper premolar is without the produced anterior shoulder noticed in mexicanus, and the inferior premolars are comparatively shorter and broader.
Measurements.
— Average of five alcoholic topotypes: Total length 87.6 mm.
(84.5-92); head and body 55.1 (53.5-56.5); head 23 (22.523.5); ear 28.5 (27-30.5); greatest width of ear 19.2 (18.5-20.5); tragus 9.5 (9-10); forearm 49.2 (48.5-50.5); thumb 12.6 (12-13.2); third digit 83.8 (81-87); tibia 20.2 (19-21); calcaueum 10.6 (10-11.2); foot 12.4 (12-13); tail 32.5 (30.5-35.5).
Average of eleven topotypic and Guadalajara skulls : Total length 23 mm.
(22.5-23.5) ; greatest zygomatic width 10.8(10.5-11.1) ; intcrorbital width 4 (4-4.2); height at base of second premolar 3.6 (3.3-4); height of brain-case 8.2 (8-9) ; breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 8.6 (8.3-9) ; width of palatal constriction 2 (2-2.3) ; length of palate 8.6 (8.3-9) ; width of palate (including teeth) 7.4 (7-7.8) ; greatest length of mandible 15 (14.6-15.5).
Remar'ks.
— This well-marked race of mexicanus can be easily recognized by the smaller size, the weak second upper and distinctly crowded third lower premolars.
The Tres Marias specimens appear to be inseparable from the mainland form.
Specimens Examined.

Remarks.
— This species can be distinguished from the waterhousii group by the slenderer structure of the whole body and skull the longer ear and the weaker dentition.
From M. mexicanus and M. huUeri, californicus can be distinguished by the characters given in the key.
The Cape St. Lucas specimens are shghtly differentiated from the typical Yuma specimens, but the differences are so extremely shght that they would not justify the separation of the Cape series.

A MONOGRAPH OF THE GENUS DENDROCINCLA Gray, BY HARRY C. OBERHOLSER.
The purpose of the investigation -whose results are set forth in the following pages is to clear up to such degree as may be possible the measurable uncertainty of identification attending the birds of the genus Dendrocinda.
This Dendrocolaptine group is composed entirely of plainly attired species which present often but slight differentiating characters; and many of the original descriptions are both so short and so unsatisfactory that the determination of their positive identity is a matter sometimes of considerable difficulty.
Individual color variation is very marked in a few of the forms, occasionally amounting to a greater degree of difference than that which distinguishes some entirely distinct species; and the sexes, though alike in color, frequently differ widely in size.
The color of the bill, which some writers have relied on to furnish specific distinctions, seems to change with age, being darkest in immature birds.
The name Dendromancs^ under which Dr. Sclater proposed to separate Dendrocinda anahatina and a few of the other small species, at first generically,^ then subgenerically,seems to have no standing other than as a simple synonym of Dendrocinda, since the alleged characters do not prove to be significant; furthermore, there are no other structural differences among the species of the genus, aside from some comparatively slight variations in length of tail, and none of these seem cause sufficient for even subgeneric division.
For the purposes of the present review there have been available examples of all the twenty forms here recognized, save two — the newly described D. macrorhyncha and the well-known D. longicauda — comprising altogether considerably over 100 specimens.
In a difl^cult group like Dendrocinda the examination of types is of great value — in many cases of prime importance — and in this we have been fortunate enough to handle the original specimens of D. tyrannina, D. atrirostris, D. 0. lafresnayei, D. meruloides, D. rufo-olivacea, D. castanoptera and 1 Sclater, Proc.

Although the present writer's work began with the collection of the United States National [Museum, including that of the Biological Survey, he is under great obligations to the authorities of the American Museum of Natural History, and of the Boston Society of Natural History, as well as to Mr. (3utram Bangs, for the loan of material, without which, particularly the valuable type specimens, it would have been impossible to arrive at anything like satisfactory conclusions.
To Mr. Glover M. Allen he is also indebted for the verification of some obscure references; and especially to Mr. Ridgway, whose constantly courteous assistance has contributed to make this paper much better than it otherwise would have been.

In other respects it appears to be close to Dendrocinda tyrcmniiui tyrannina, of which it may prove through further research to be but a subspecies.

Apparently a very distinct species, as pointed out by Mr. Ridgway,^ though for some time confused with Dendrocincla olivacea lafresnayei, but really much more closely allied to tyrannina and longicauda than to either lafresnayei or olivacea.
From D. tyrannina tyrannina it differs principally in much smaller size ; rather paler upper and much paler lower parts ; very conspicuous postocular stripe ; and the more ashy chin and cheeks.
The two tj^es in the Lafresnaye collection (Nos.
2,308 and 2,309) are the only specimens of this species that have been examined.
Both are apparently not quite adult, though fully grown; one of them is considerably more olivaceous than the other, but this seems imdoubtedly to be only an individual difference.

® Tip of maxilla broken.
The bird described by Pelzeln as Dendrocincla minor ^ from San Vicente, Matto Grosso, Brazil, which has hitherto remained unidentified, is undoubtedly the same as that previously called atrirostris by Lafresnaye.
This is evident from a comparison of the original description of minor with the types of atrirostris, which shows a perfect agreement both in dimensions and other characters.
Furthermore, San Vicente, the type locality of minor, is in southwestern Brazil, not far from Guarayos, Bolivia, whence came the first specimens of atrirostris.
This species appears to have a limited distribution, being kno\^^l from only eastern Bolivia and Matto Grosso, Brazil, for all citations of atrirostris from Ecuador and Colombia belong elsewhere.

One of the most conspicuous forms of the genus.
In a general way it resembles Dendrocincla atrirostris, but may at once be distinguished by its immaculate buffj^ or ochraceous buff chin, in sharp contrast to the color of the breast; by the color of the outer webs of the'secondaries, which is tawny or bright tawny-rufous, unique in the genus and strikingly different from the olive-brown of the wing-coverts or the dark fuscous of the tips of the wing-quills ; by a much shorter tail ; as well as by other less obvious characters.
Birds from Panama are not distinguishable either in size or color from those of Nicaragua or even the States of Tabasco and "\"era Cruz, Mexico; but those examined from Guatemala are rather paler, though not sufficiently so to warrant either their separation or their reference to typhla.

The type of Dendrocinda anahatina anahatina came from Omoa, Hondm-as, and although this is not far from the eastern part of Yucatan, yet a specimen seen from La Puerta, Honduras, near the type locahty, is decidedly different from tijphla, and indistinguishable from those taken in Guatemala, while one from Santa Ana, Honduras, is still darker.
This, therefore, fixes anahatina as the dark form, leaving the Yucatan bird to be supphed with a name, as above.

Similar to D. atrirostris, from which, however, it may readily be distinguished by its much more olivaceous coloration both above and below, as well as its lack of pale shaft streaks on the feathers of the pileum.
Its olivaceous colors separate it from also D. anahatina anahatina, and in other respects it differs from this form much as D. atrirostris does.
Mr. Ridgway's Dendrocinda rufo-olivacea; which imfortunately he was unable to compare ^-ith authentic examples of fuliginosa, seems to be identical with D. fuliginosus, as some time ago considered by Sclater;^ so that unless more abundant material should prove it a recognizable geographical race occupying the Amazon valley 8 Proc.

The type and two other specimens from Diamantina, together with one from Para, Brazil, which represent the material at Mr. Ridgway's disposal when describing rufo-olivacea, have all been examined in the present connection, and these alone, although the only specimens now available, indicate a considerable amount of individual variation in D. fuliginosa.
The type of rufo-olivacea and one other from Diamantina are evidently much paler, more grayish below than ordinary fuliginosa, and are quite different from the Para specimen, with which, however, the third Diamantina example very closely agrees.

Resembling D. atrirostris, but apparently larger (wing 100-107 mm.)
; throat and sides of head more rufescent ; exposed surface of wing-cpiills duller, more olivaceous, not so much contrasted with the color of the back; chin paler; ochraceous postocular stripe lacking.
From D. fuliginosa it differs in very much more rufescent upper and lower parts ; smaller bill; and conspicuousljpale-streaked pileum.
In the Lafresnaye collection there are two specimens of this species marked as the types ; but this is evidently not quite correct, for they were probably nothing more than the specimens used for description by Lafresnaye in his monograph of the genus Dendrocolaptes,^'^ as the species was originally named by Lichtenstein,^^ and the real type is, or should be, in the Berlin Museum, where many, if not most, of Lichtenstein's types were deposited.
Dr. Sclater records a specimen of Dendrocincla turdina from Rio, Brazil,^which is possibly to be referred to D. enalincia, though without examination this is of course impossible to determine.
The decided variation in size among specimens of this form examined b}^ Dr. Sclater'^ is undoubtedly merely sexual.

In a considerable series of typical Dendrocincla turdina, exhibiting the usual amount of individual variation in depth and shade of color to which members of this genus are commonly subject, there is no specimen that can be considered intermediate between turdina and enalincia.
In view of this, as well as of the fact that in Dendrocincla perfectly distinct species are often very much alike, enalincia, on account of its decided characters, has here been given full specific rank, although it may in time prove to be but the southern subspecific representative of D. turdina.

This very distinct species resembles to some extent D. tiirdina, but is darker above; very much darker, more olivaceous below; the throat is more whitish ; the pileum without pale shaft streaks ; the wings are clear chestnut instead of tinged with ohvaceous, being thus more contrasted with the color of the back; and the hning of the wing is darker.
The specimen of this species in the Lafresnaye collection, marked ''type" (No, 2,304), is probably only the specimen used by Lafresnaye for descriptive purposes, as Lichtenstein's original example is still in the Berlin Museum.
Mr. Ridgway's Dendrocincla castanoptera^* is regrettably a synonym of D. merula, for the type and one other specimen now in the U. S. National Museum do not differ in any essential respect from two examples in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History, taken by S. M. Klages at Suapure, Venezuela, nor from the Lafresnaye specimen above mentioned.
The two examples of castanoptera are considerably smaller than the Lafresnaye specimen of merula with which Mr, Ridgway compared them, but this is certainly but a sexual distinction.
This sexual difference may easily be appreciated by reference to the following comparative measurements: Sex.

Like Dendrocincla olivacea olivacea in size ; but in color lighter, more rufescent above and below, the lining of wing paler.
From D. atrirostris it may be distinguished principally by lack of pale shaft streaks on the pileum; obsolescent or absent ochraceous postocular stripe; more olivaceous upper surface; and conspicuously more olivaceous wings.
As may thus easily be seen, lafresnayei is far more nearly related to D. olivacea, D. fuliginosa, and even D. meridoides than to D. atrirostris, although nearly all writers excepting Mr. Ridgway have, at least in part, confused lafresnayei with atrirostris; and all records of atrirostris or olivacea from Ecuador or Colombia refer undoubtedly to the present form.

^^ The specimen in the Lafresnaye collection labelled as one of the types of D. atrirostris, and referred l)}^ Mr. Ridgway to D. olivacea,^^ is undoubtedly an example of lafresnayei.
Specimens of olivacea from Panama, clearly intermediate between olivacea and lafresnayei, point conclusively to the necessity of using a trinomial for the latter.

Very close to Dendrocincla olivacea lafresnayei, and in size and general color both above and IdcIow not distinguishable ; iDut it has the chin and cheeks less graj'ish.
as well as the chestnut of the wing-qviills less washed with olivaceous.
It differs more decidedly from true olivacea, however, in its lighter, more rufescent coloration, more ochraceous chin, and less olivaceous wdng-quills.
From D. merula, although of the same size, it may be readily distinguished by its paler, rather more olivaceous upper parts; much lighter, more rufescent or ochraceous ventral surface, the throat buffy or ochraceous instead of whitish or grayish ; lighter lores ; and a slightly evident ochraceous postocular stripe.
Three specimens in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History, collected by S. M. Klages in ^'enezuela — two from Suapure, one from La Union, Caura — agree perfectly with Messrs. Berlepsch and Hartert's original description of pJueochroa.
These have l^een carefully compared with the type of lafresnayei as well as with the considerable series of that form at present availal^le, with the result of demonstrating that phceochroa is at l^est Ijut a subspecies of olivacea, since the only characters discernible to separate it from lafresnayei are shown to be not entirely constant; yet it still is probably quite entitled to stand as a geographical race on its merits as above said.

This new species appears to be undoubtedly most closely allied to Dendrocincla olivacea lafresnayei.
From D. olivacea olivacea, whose territory it inhabits, it differs in much the same respects as from lafresnayei, but more strongly.
The type and sole specimen has been for some years in the U. S. National Museum collection, and has been successively identified as D. merula, D. olivacea and D. atrirostris!
It seems to be undoubtedly a distinct and hitherto undescribed species, for its peculiarities are not such as appear readily or satisfactorily explainable on grounds of individual variation.
It bears its present name in honor of Mr. Robert Ridgway, as a shght token of the author's appreciative esteem.

All the specimens of true meruloides examined are females, and agree in size with those of the same sex of D. meruloides aphanta.
The measurements of meruloides given by Mr. Ridgway-' are also based on female examples, and are therefore too small.
The name Dendrocinda merulina of Cabanis and Heine-is a mere puristic emendation of D. meruloides, and must therefore be considered identical in application.

POST-GLACIAL NEARCTIC CENTRES OF DISPERSAL FOR REPTILES.
BY ARTHUR ERWIN BROWN.
If lasting values are to be reached in the study of geographical distribution, its conclusions must accord with all else that is know^^ of the dynamics of evolution.
Or, stated with moreexact reference to its especial problems, the areas marked off by it must correspond to the distributional relations of genetically connected species and, at the least, must not be at fault with possible Imes of dispersal from centres of development by which they may have come to occupj^ their present range.
What is proposed here is an attempt to determine such centres for Reptilia in North America.
The scarcity of Tertiary remains of reptiles belonging to existing groups confines the student of geographical distribution in the main to post-glacial conditions, with little more knowledge of those preceding than the practical certainty that genera now widely ranging are of great antiquity and were likewise wide ranging in earlier periods, and that a former north Atlantic land connection between Europe and America must have coincided with a climate of sufficient warmth to serve for the passage of reptiles belonging to genera now common to both.
In other ways the problem is simplified by the absence in later periods of a circumpolar reptilian fauna, a consequence of which is that the chief zoological bond of connection between the eastern and western continents is wanting, and for reptiles a "Holarctic" region or an "Arctogsean" realm can not be said to exist, the families and genera common to more southern portions of both being insufficient to link them.
For this reason Mr. Sclater's term ''Nearctic" is used here.
It should be said, however, that if for purposes of convenience or uniformity it be desired to retain these later and broader generalizations, no harm is likely to ensue if it be remembered that they do not express the exact facts of present reptilian distribution, whatever they may have been during the Tertiary.
A further simplification results in northern regions from this same absence of boreal reptiles, for it eliminates the meeting ground of a northern with a southern migration, which constitutes the "Transition" zone of various authors in other groups.
If a transition zone existed in the Nearctic for reptiles it would follow meridians of longitude west of the Mississippi river, instead of extending from c ast to west.
I ha\'e stated elsewhere* that the present distribution of Nearctic reptiles points to the two post-glacial centres indicated by Prof. C. C. Adams/ one in the southeastern Austroriparian, the other southwestern, in the Sonoran.
Some space must now be given to the evidence.
In the same paper it was shown that m the southern Nearctic the eastern and western reptilian faunas are so distinct that the community between them is limited to a few species belonging to widely ranging genera, and that the zone of change between them lies approximately between the 96° and 98° meridians of longitude in Texas.
In a general way this zone may be carried north along those meridians, to mark the separation between the whole Atlantic and the whole Sonoran faunas, widening, however, toward the north in following up the rivers of the Mississippi drainage.
The division is in some measure obscured by the presence in the lowlands of the Mississippi and its tributaries of a few species, chiefly serpents, originally derived from both faunas and occupying the contiguous portions of their respective areas.
The proposition that original post-glacial centres must have lain far to the south, is more logically necessary in the case of reptiles than with other vertebrates, and follows from their dependence as a class upon warmth.
If further evidence were needed, it would be found in their great numerical superiority, both in species and iiidividuals, in the south.
The whole extent of North America reaching from the border of the great plains eastward to the Atlantic coast, and from the Gulf of Mexico to the northern limit of reptiles, which, following Agassiz, will here be known as the Atlantic subregion, to avoid confusion with Its Eastern district, contains 113 species and recognizable subspecies in all orders of reptiles.
Of these 56 are confined to some portion of the Austroriparian district, and 15 are exclusively Eastern with 42 common to both, practically all of which are southern intrusions to varying distances into the Eastern.
In the western Nearctic the distribution of species is vastly more complex as to its details on account of the great variety of surrounding conditions in contiguous areas produced by rapid changes in altitude, and is not yet fully known but the excess of southern species is even greater, for assuming that 5'l^^^^;i;^^^n^s_dnasi^^ from the western border of the I Proc.

•SO Atlantic subregion to the Pacific coast into a Lower and an Upper Sonoran accords best with present knowledge, the Lower Sonoran seems to have about 74 peculiar species, and the Upper Sonoran plus his Transition has but about 13, with 35 common to both, of which 19 may be regarded as Lower Sonoran and only 6 as Upper.
The remainder belong to the Atlantic fauna.
It should be explained that these estimates are based upon a somewhat conservative view as to species, but if the method of minute analysis characteristic of the present time be followed, the predominance of Lower Sonoran forms will be even greater.
Both from the logical necessity of the case and from the application of one of the main criteria in common use, it seems clear that the areas which at the retreat of the ice contained the elements from which our present reptilian fauna has developed, must be sought for in the south.
The briefest examination of the character and the abounding richness of the reptiles inhabiting the dry plateau extending from Texas to Arizona and south into Mexico, as well as the physical geography of the whole Sonoran subregion, are enough to show that the dispersal centre of that faura M-as hfre, in Cope's Chihuahuan.
The Austroriparian is less clear without close examination of evidence.
Two localities in this subregion excel all others in variety of species, one in the extreme southeast toward Georgia and Florida, corresponding to the fauna termed by Cope Ocmulgian; the other, or Louisianan, on the lower Mississippi.
Fifty-one species are common to both, and in addition the Ocmulgian, including Cope's Floridan, presents 21 not extending into the Louisianan, which in turn has 14, one half of them, however, only entering its western border from the Sonoran.
Of the two the Ocmulgian shows a decidedly greater diversity in species.
A study in some detail of the genera points in the same direction.
Little argument is required to demonstrate the proposition that genera now common to the Nearctic and the western Palsearctic must have had that range established at a time when a Tertiary north Atlantic land connection coincided with a w^aim climate in the north, for the absence from all beyond the northern border of the Neotropical of such vigorous Nearctic genera as Coluber, Zamenis, Tropidonotus, Eutcenia, Ophiholns and others, which are identical with or nearly related to Holarctic genei'a, renders it impossible that such community in northern regions could have come about by means of the Antarctic continent whose former existence is now urged by many palaeontologists, however well this would serve to explain such anomalies as the 1904.]
467 presence of pleurodire turtles in South America, and of two genera of Neotropical Boida3 in Madagascar.
It has been showai by Heer, in his researches upon Arctic fossil plants, that in the process of secular cooling the mean temperature of northern Greenland, as late as the early Miocene, was not far removed from that of central Virginia at the present time — quite warm enough for the needs of such hardy stocks as the genera above named — and the differentiation of reptiles of modern types" had progressed so far by the close of the Mesozoic, that not much risk is incurred in believing that many existing genera were in existence long before the end of the Eocene.
Assuming a north Atlantic highroad to have been the means of communication, the longest Nearctic establishment of these common forms is likely to have been in the older geological regions far in the east.
It is further true that with many of them traces of their primitive representatives appear to be found in existing species of the eastern part of the Austroriparian.
Omitting mere Neotropical intrusions into the southern border of the Nearctic, such as Alligator, Crocodilus, Anolis, Sphcerodactylus , Helicops, Spilotes, Rhadinea, Drymobius, Tantilla, ErytJirolamprus and Elaps, as well as Trionyx, Chelydra, Emys and Testudo, each of which had a wide Tertiary extension in northern regions, but whose recent distribution throws no further light on the present question, most of the remaining genera may be referred for their origin to the Austroriparian or Lower Sonoran faunas.

Nevertheless, it is obvious that conditions best favoring the development of freshwater turtles must have always been far more completely presented in the well watered Atlantic subregion than in the arid Sonoran.
In Cinosternidae the extensive range of the Atlantic species, Cinosternum pennsylvanicum and Aromochelys odoratus, favors the view that they have been longest established, and it would appear further that the Louisianan and Sonoran species do not exhibit any great amount of differentiation from these forms.
Of the thirteen species of Chrysemys found in the whole Nearctic, ten are restricted to the Atlantic subregion.
Eight of these are Austroriparian, three of them entering the Eastern.
The near relationship between C. concinna, C. mobilensis, C. scabra and C. rubriventris .
all especially numerous on the southeastern coast, points to their long presence there.
In the Nearctic, Emys and Clemmys are confined to the Eastern, with the exception of one species of Clemmys on the Pacific coast, but each has a representative in the Palsearctic, and Emys is known from the Eocene of both continents.
No reason can be assigned for their present limited Nearctic range, which must be looked upon as one of the anomalies of survival of ancient forms.
The box tortoises of the genus Terrapene range everj^where east of the Rocky mountains, but if the view of Dr. Baur be accepted, that the gradual disappearance of the quadrato-jugal is a progressive character, T. major of the southern Austroriparian and T. hauri of Florida are the most primitive.
A distinctly negative character of the whole Atlantic subregion is its poverty in lizards, their almost complete absence being, in fact, the correlative of an abundance of water turtles.
Its lizards are Sonoran, with the exception of Ophisaurus, restricted to the Austroriparian, whose close relationship to the Palsearctic Pseiidopus justifies placing its original centre along the Atlantic coast, and Rhineura, now only found in Florida, but perhaps known from the Oligocene of Dakota.
Ldolepisma laterale, which occupies only the Austroriparian and the southeastern corner of the Eastern as far as New Jersey, belongs to a genus of wide extension in the Austrahan, Ethiopian and Oriental regions, but having no other representative in the Holarctic except one in China, whose specific characters are identical with it.^ This instance conforms to the unknown law which has preserved on the eastern shores of Asia and North America so many allied remnants of ancient groups among both animals and plants.
More exact e\'idence is afforded by Ophidia, for with two exceptions it is believed that the genera now widely spread in the Nearctic can be shown to have probably originated in the eastern centre.
Of those more locally restricted, which must in most cases be descendants of these earlier forms, a difficulty must be admitted in the comparative absence of structural clues to relationship, especially in Colubridge.
The relative position assigned to genera by Mr. Boulenger, however, merits a high degree of confidence and has been much relied upon.
It may be added that there are quite enough cases where high probability can be assm-ed, to warrant propositions with which the uncertain ones at least fail to conflict.
The genus Tropidonotus, cosmopolitan as to the greater life areas except that it enters only the northern border of the Neotropical, in the Nearctic is absent from the Pacific coast, and in fact enters the Sonoran only by its river bottoms, from which the assumption is justified that it originally entered North America from western Europe.
The common species of the whole Atlantic subregion, Tropidonotus sipedon, seems quite surely to have been near the parent form, though it is less clear which of the two subspecies, T. s. sipedon or T. s. fasciatus, should be regarded.
The young of both, as a rule.
3 Boulenger, Cat.
of Lizards, Vol.
Ill, p. 264. have the color pattern of the adults, but more or less cross-banding with narrow interspaces frequently replaces the spots on the forepart of the body in young and some adult T. s. sipcdon, resembling those which form the normal pattern on the whole length in eastern examples of T. s. fasciatus — a fact which perhaps signifies the partial retention of an ancestral pattern, now completely lost in the third subspecies, T. s. transversus of the Louisianan fauna.
It is probable that T. s. fasciatus of the southeast represents the earliest form.
Within the bounds of the Ocmulgian, T. cyclopeum and T. taxispilotus have developed from T. sipedon, while farther west, in the Mississippi valley, the way to T. rhombifer was through T. s. transversus.
The whole of the illdefined series grouped about T. compressicaudus and T. ustus is Floridan and shows the wealth of differentiation, still unstable as to fixity of character, which has resulted in the Ocmulgian under conditions highly favorable to the genus.
There seems no clue to the direct origin of the group of species represented hj T. leberis and its allies, with seventeen or nineteen rows of scales and longitudinal stripes, but it is worth noting that a similar distribution of color occurs m a number of eastern Palsearctic and Oriental Tropidonotus.
Separated structurally from the foregoing genus only by its entire anal plate is Eutcenia, which covers the whole Nearctic to the northern limit of snakes, and perhaps equals in number of individuals all other species combined.
From its cosmopolitan extension Tropidonotus must be the parent.
It is suggestive that the eastern form of the common garter snake, known as E. sirtalis ordinatus, with dark spots on a greenish ground and no stripes, much resembles some color phases of Tropidonotus natrix of Europe, and has like it nineteen rows of scales and seven upper labials.
The yellow collar of T. natrix is not known in any race of E. sirtalis, but it possibly reappears in the pale postoral crescents of some Sonoran species, as E. marciana and E. hammondi.
E. s. ordinatus grades into E. s. sirtalis, whose western representative, E. s. parietalis, on the Pacific coast rims into E. elegans through such examples as those which Cope regarded as E. infernalis,* and in the southwestern Sonoran into E. marciana, E. hammondi and E. eques.
The species of the great plains, E. radix, has commonly twenty-one scale rows and seven upper labials, but often presents the scutellation of E. sirtalis and probably is derived from it, an important change being that the lateral stripe has moved up one row of scales.
And it ^ A. E. Brown, Proc.

of Phila., 1903, p. 288, etc.
1904.1 471 is of interest here to note that certain garter snakes from Indiana, about the eastern limit of E. radix, called by Cope E. butleri, show irregularities in the position of the lateral stripe perhaps indicating transition.
E. radix is a connecting link on the one hand with E. proxima of the Mississippi valley, which in the east has given off E. saurita and E. sackeni, and on the other, in the southwest with E. 7negalops and doubtles other Mexican forms.
If this hypothetical family-tree of Eutasnia is correct, an interesting lesson in lines of dispersal of Austroriparian genera may be gained from their diagrammatic representation : E. s. leptocephala E. s. pickeringi E. e. elegans E. e. vagrans E. hammondr E. eques/ E. marciana E. megalops E. s. parietalis E. radix E. s. ordinatus -E. s. sirtalis E. proxima E. saurita E. sackeni Of the remaining so-called Natricinae, all of which are small and more or less degenerate representatives of Tropidonotus and EutoBnia or of the stock from which they came, the most widely spread genera, Storeria, Haldea and Virginia are chiefly Atlantic, Seminatrix is wholly Ocmulgian, Tropidoonium, of limited range and probably of relatively late origin, belongs to the Mississippi valley, and the very few specimens of Amphiardis known are from Dallas, Texas, on the western borderland of the Austroriparian.
Among other widely ranging genera, Zamenis is an ancient form whose present distribution includes also the Palsearctic and Oriental regions.
The earliest Nearctic style seems likely to be represented by Z. flageUum flagellum, which belongs to the Ocmulgian centre.
The young of this species show narrow cross-bands, and occasionally much wider ones, as well as a tendency to form narrow stripes on the centres of some of the lateral scale rows, all of these being present as diagnostic characters in various combination in adults of most other American species.
The inequality of color between the anterior and posterior portions of the body, characteristic of all, is most pronounced in Z. f. flagellum.
Coluber has about the same range as Zamenis, but in the Nearctic does not pass beyond the Rocky mountains.
The distribution of color most common in the genus consists of three rows of spots, but in many species, especially in America, there is a disposition for these to run together by their corners and form longitudinal stripes.
This is indicated more especially in some western and Central American species, as C. subocularis and C. lineaticolUs, and culminates in C. quadrivittatus, which is spotted when young and wholly striped when mature.
C. ohsoletus confinis is in most respects generalized as to pattern, and either this species, or less probably C. guttatus, both chiefly Ocmulgian, are likely to be near the primitive form.
In the Lower Sonoran Coluber has given off Arizona and Pihjophis, the last having sent one species, P. melanoleucus , the most specialized of the genus in the shape of its rostral, and in disappearance of the head bands in adults, back into the Atlantic as far north as New Jersey.
The genus Ophibolus, generally distributed in the Nearctic, except in the northwest, is nearly related to Coronella of the western Palsearctic and Ethiopian.
It does not seem possible to determine whether the parent is represented by some color form of 0. gctulus or 0. doliatus, but the coronelline affinity indicates with sufficient certainty that OpMholus must have come from a soiu-ce whose Palsearctic connections were by way of the eastern or north Atlantic route.
It may be significant that while no subspecific distinction is warranted, most Floridan examples of 0. gchdus getulus, which is the most vigorous and extended species, seem to be rather generalized in the character of the dorsal spots and bands, as between northern specimens of the same form and the Louisianan 0. g. sayi.
The further fact has a bearing, that the specific characters of forms from the western part of the Nearctic seem to show less stability than the eastern ones, especially so in 0. g. boylii and 0. g. californice, thus pointing to a more recent development of these subspecies.
Liopeltis and Cyclophis are examples of the remarkable discontinuity already noted in the range of certain other genera common to eastern Asia and eastern North America.
In the last Liopeltis covers the whole Atlantic subregion, while Cyclophis is mamly Austroriparian.
Both extend to no great distance into the Sonoran.
The case for Heterodon is not free from doubt.
The form of its rostral seems to suggest that it belongs among the types which have been so freely developed in the dry Lower Sonoran, and its possible relationship to the South American Lystrophis would accord with this assignment, but on the other hand, the largest and most widely spread Species, H. platyrhinos, is found upon suitable soils over most of the Atlantic subregion and is especially common on the coast from New Jersey to Florida; H. simus is Austroriparian and chiefly Ocmulgian; while the smallest and most feeble species only, H. nasicus, is Sonoran and does not extend west of the Rocky mountains.
There is good reason, therefore, to refer Heterodon to the Austroriparian, in which case its Neotropical affinity renders it probable that Florida was the region of its origin.
Among Crotalida^, Ancistrodon only can be referred to the Atlantic subregion, A. contortrix being spread over its whole extent and A. piscivorus confined to the Austroriparian, where numerically it is in excess in the extreme southeast.
Both species enter the borders of the Sonoran at suitable localities.
The assignment of the genus to the Atlantic coast is further justified by its occurrence in eastern Asia.
Of these more or less cosmopolitan, or Holarctic genera, which must be supposed to have occupied the Nearctic during the Tertiary, and even of related groups restricted to the Nearctic but of sufficient extension there to warrant belief in their relatively considerable age, it is seen that there is reason to believe that all but Sceloporus, Cnemidophorus, Eumeces, Sistrurus and Crotalus belonged to the Atlantic post-glacial centre, which from the present numerical proportion of species and individuals, as well as the geological age of the region, seems to have been the Ocmulgian.
From this centre a route to the north has been freely open along the low coast plain east of the Alleghenies, to distances into the Eastern district determined for each migrant by limiting conditions, of which, in this case, temperature must be regarded as the most important.
A few powerful species, such as Coluber obsoletus obsoletus, Ophibolus doliatus triangulus and to a less extent PityopMs melanoleucus, have chosen this route to the region north of the Ohio river, turning westward about the Potomac or Susquehanna.
The other main highway was westward along the Gulf coast to the Mississippi river and up that valley, where conditions are highly favorable to reptilian life, spreading eastward at the north to southern Indiana and Ohio.
Few species traveled this route unaltered, for with most of them the changed conditions encountered have resulted in the establishing of variations, at least of color, with which a sound taxonomy must reckon.
An excellent example of this is Ophibolus getulus getulus, which ranges from Florida north to the pine region of New Jersey with no change which has yet been held to warrant a new trinominal, l^iit on its western course, as it enters the Louisianan it becomes 0. g. sayi, and still further west, in the Texan, is even now perhaps differentiating into a color form known as 0. g. splendidiis.
The Louisianan subspecies has moved up the Mississippi valley as far as southern Illinois, and even in that region an occasional specimen shows the pattern of splendidus.
The lower Mississippi valley may indeed, with some reason, be regarded as a secondary and more modern centre of development in Chelonia and Ophidia.
Quite different from the condition of temperature which has limited the northward extension of Ocmulgian forms, that which has checked or transformed them on the western route is the lack of moisture encountered beyond the Mississippi, about the beginning of the great plains.
Another northwestward route from the Ocmulgian may have been directly through or around the lower end of the Alleghenies by way of ancient river valleys, but it is not probable that this was traveled as freely as those leading by the coast plain in either direction.
It may be repeated that the present study deals only with postglacial conditions.
If, as has been assumed, the interchange of reptiles between the Nearctic and the Palsearctic was by means of a north Atlantic connection, their Tertiary centres of development were doubtless of greater area and much farther to the north.

A Spencer Objective.
— Mr. F. J. Keeley described a microscope objective of one-fourth inch focus, made in 1860 by Charles A. Spencer.
It was recently necessary to take apart the back system for re-balsaming, Avhen it was fomid to consist of five lenses, three of which were convex and two concave.
One of these proved, on examination with polarized light, to be fliiorite, which mineral, while isotropic, exhibits characteristic optical anomalies between crossed prisms that permit of its identification, at least in contradistinction from glass or other material used for lenses.
The fluorite lens is perfectly preserved, as might be expected from the stable character of the mineral.
When objectives of more recent manufacture containing fluorite have deteriorated, the fluorite has been blamed for faults which should imdoubtedly have been attributed to unreliable glass used in connection with it.
This objective is historically interesting as illustrating the complex nature of the corrections adopted by Spencer at so early a date, as well as confirming the previous reports that he had appreciated the possibilities connected with the use of fluorite in securing superior color corrections and employed it for the purpose twenty years before it came into use abroad.
The objective has an aperture of 142 to 152 degrees, according to position of adjustment, which acts by rectilinear movement of back systems, and is unusualh^ well corrected for color.
It resolves Pleurosigma angulatum sharply into dots with central light from mirror, and with oblique illumination resolves markings 76,000 to the inch.
In some respects its performance was possibly slightly sacrificed in eHminating color, for with a large central illuminating cone, its definition is somewhat inferior to that of objectives of similar power made by Tolles at slightly earlier and later dates, which show considerably more color.
The latter, although both over forty years old, compare favorably, optically and mechanically, with best achromatics made today, and it seems not unlikely that Spencer abandoned the use of fluorite because he realized that sharp definition was more important than the elimination of last trace of color, rather than from any fear of its lack of permanency.
The Publication Committee reported that a paper had been presented for publication under the title "Observation on Hyrax," by Henry C. Chapman, M.D.
(April 29, 1904).
The following was ordered to be printed : OBSERVATIONS ON HYRAX.
BY HENRY C. CHAPMAN, M.D.
The structure of Hyrax has been so thoroughly investigated by Pallas/ Owen,2 Brandt,^ Mirie and Mivart/ and George,^ as well as by other anatomists, that little or nothing remains now to be said by any one to whom the rare opportunity is afforded of dissecting this interesting animal.
In exhibiting to the Academy the muscular system and viscera of a fine male specimen of Hyrax {Procavia Brucei), most kindly put at the disposition of the writer by Messiem-s Edmond, Perrier and Gervais, of the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, attention was nevertheless called to the fact that the figures illustrating the form of stomach as offered by Pallas, Brandt and George give an imperfect, even an erroneous, idea of that of the stomach of the Hyrax dissected by the writer.
According to the anatomists just referred to, the cardiac portion of the stomach in Hyrax is large and globular, the pyloric portion small and narrow, whereas exactly the reverse obtains in the stomach of the specimen submitted to the writer (fig.
1).
In^ Xy'/v I asmuch as the narrow cardiac portion ' ' ^ of the stomach is extremely muscular in Hyrax, it might be supposed that such condition may have been due to the fluid m which the specimen had been preserved.
In the Fig.
1. judgment of the writer the marked difference in contour presented by the two regions of the stomach cannot be so accounted for.
In confirmation of the view that the form of the stomach so found was normal and not due to post-mortem ^ Spicilegia Zoologica, 1767, p. 16.

At the same time the small intestine was empty, which would not have been the case had the stomach contracted to any extent upon its contents.
It is well known that in the six-banded armadillo {Dastjpus sexcindus), in the two-toed ant eater (Myrmecophaga didadyla) and m the two-toed sloth {Chplcepus Hofnianni) the coecum presents two coecal processes, and in Hyrax, in addition to a coecum proper, the alimentary canal is provided with a second dilatation, terminating also in two coecal processes resembling somewhat those just referred to as occurring in the edentates just mentioned.
It will be observed, however, that the two coecal processes found in Hyrax, but in no other mammal, so far as is known to the writer, are appendages of the colon and not of the coecum proper.
The significance of these colonic appendages is not known.
The length of the alimentary canal in Hyrax is as follows according to Owen George Chapman Small intestine, 54 64 38 inches.
Coecum, ^ ^^ ,, Colonic coecum, ^ q? ''
Large intestine, 58 oz 60 112 120 778 The length of the alimentary canal was nearly five times that of the animal, measured from snout to anus, a ratio not differing essentially from that of Owen^ and George.^ The villi of the small intestme of Hyrax, as is well known, are remarkably well developed, indeed as long proportionally as in the rhinoceros.^ The attention of anatomists does not appear, however, to have been directed to the fact that some of the vilh are longer than others, the former terminating in branched or club-like processes (fig 2) resembling somewhat the villi of the Indian rhinoceros studied 'by the writer.
In view of the difference of opinion that has prevaUed among systematists as to the affinities of Hyrax with the remaining mammalia, this fact might be urged as con" Exclusive of colonic coeca. '

firming the view held by Ciivier'" and Owcn/^ that Hyrox is nearly related to the rhinoceros, as shown by its rhinoceros-like incisor and molar teeth, the incisor teeth being developed as in the extinct Rhinoceros incisiviis, the molar teeth presenting essentially the same pattern in both animals; the position of the oesophagus in regard to the stomach, the relatively simple stomach and complex coecum, the perissodactyle number of ribs 22, the hoofs of the unsymmetrical tetradactyle fore-foot and tridactyle hindfoot as in Aceratherium, an extinct hornless rhinoceros, etc.
On the other hand, as I^'ig-■ first shown by Home,'the placenta in Hyrax is zonular, like that of the elephant and carnivora — a fact somewhat inconsistent with the view that would regard Hyrax as a little rhinoceros.
Still, it must be admitted, since it has been shown by the writer'^ that the same kind of mammals (Edentata) may have different form of placenta and different kinds of mammals the same form, that the form of the placenta is of little or no value in the classification of the mammalia.
In the absence of fossil remains of Hyrax, though the extinct Hyracotherium may be somewhat allied, it is impossible to assign Hyrax to any livmg form of mammals.
For the present, therefore, it may be regarded as siii generis the representative of an extinct order Hyracoidra, of which Dendrohyrax is also a member.
As a matter of record, it may be stated that fragments of a species of tapeworm (Moniezia) were found in the small intestine, and also a number of specimens of Ascaris ferox, as identified by my colleague.
Prof. Percy Moore.
In regard to the urogenital apparatus, its disposition was found to be essentially the same as described by Pallas, George, etc.
In the specimen of Hyrax dissected by the writer, the testicles were found lying in the abdominal cavity below the kidneys, and were longer rather than shorter than the latter, as hitherto described.
The ureters opened into the fundus of the bladder, the aperture of the left one being situated a trifle lower than that of the right one.
The vasa deferentia, as they pass behind the bladder, become so much convoluted as to resemble a second epididymis, terminating finally in two openings situated in the under part of the veru montanum of the urethra.
The lower convoluted portions of the vasa deferentia, just referred to, '» Ossemens Fossiles, 1834, Tome 3, p. 251.

are regarded by George" as performing the functions of seminal vesicles.
Owen, however, states^^ having found true seminal vesicles quite distinct from the convoluted portions of the vasa deferentia just mentioned.
Further, there are two additional pairs of glands, the ducts of the first opening into the upper portion of the veru montaniim, those of the second into the bulb of the urethra, and regarded respectively by George" as prostate and Couper's glands.
The prostate glands were considered by both Pallas'^ and Cuvier^* to be the seminal vesicles, but as the ducts of the latter terminate by openings quite distinct from those of the vasa deferentia, their nature as interpreted by George is probably the correct one.
The levatores muscles of the penis arise from the symphysis pubis, and terminate in a single tendon, as was the case in the rhinoceros dissected by the writer, a disposition first noticed by Owen.^'' The erectores and acceleratores muscles were well developed.
The Hyrax is regarded by naturalists and Biblical scholars as being the animal referred to in the Bible as the " coney" — the |DJ^ (saphan) of the Hebrews and the /otpoypuUtu^ of the Greeks.
The Hebrews were forbidden by their law to make use of the coney as an article of food, it being considered by them to be unclean, "because he cheweththe cud, but divideth not the hoof" (Lev.
xi.
5).
Biblical scholars, in their efforts to determine what kmd of an animal the coney of the Bible really was, do not appear, however, so far as known to the writer, to have noticed that, according to readings of Tischendorff and Van Ess, Vetus Test Greece (Leviticus xi.
5), the coney does not chew the cud, " xac '<>'■' ■^(npnyiiuHtir^^ on duk w^uysc pjjpo-'UfrfKr/" ; whereas, according to Deuteronomy xiv.

the versions that the coney cheweth the cud.
As a matter of fact the Hyrax does not chew the cud, even though the movements of its jaws during feeding would suggest such action.
Its stomach, though divided into two distinct regions, is not adapted for rumination, and the animal has never been observed to perform that act either in the wild state or in captivity.
It is possible, therefore, that the Hyrax of Syria, after all, is not the animal referred to in the Bible as the coney, even though the rocks were a refuge for the latter, according to the Psalmist (civ.
18), as they still are for the Hyrax, and that the coneys, like the Hyrax, are a "feeble folk, yet make their houses in the rocks" (Prov.
XXX.
26).
On the other hand, if the Hyrax is stUl to be regarded as the coney, as the Arabs think, then the Biblical texts in which it is stated that the coney cheweth the cud should be revised to make them consistent with what is known to be the habit of Hyrax in this^ respect.

The President, Samuel G. Dixon, M.D., in the Chair.
Thirty-six persons present.
The deaths of Maxwell Sommerville, a member, May 5, and of Henry M. Stanley, a correspondent.
May 10, were announced.
The Publication Committee reported that a paper entitled "New Polychaeta from California," by J. Percy Moore, had been offered for publication (May 16).
Summer Activity of Some Spring Flowers.
— Dr. Ida Keller remarked that the suddenness with which the first warm days of spring call into bemg the so-called "spring flowers" is a yearly repeated surprise, and although the following summer months are characterized by conditions far more conducive to vegetative activity, we are accustomed to find the plants which were conspicuous in April, May and June sinking gradually into insignificance.
Their time of active service seems, therefore, to be confined within narrow limits.
The slightest acquaintance with the laws governing plant physiology leads to the conclusion that the complex structures thus quickly appearing are in reality the result of the usual slow and elaborate processes of the various phases of metabolism, and indeed close observation shows that at least some of our well-known species are busily at work during the entire summer, preparing with great care and circumspection for the sensational outburst of the vernal season.
No better illustration of this point could be found than the Mayapple.
It is interesting to dig in the soil about these plants in July or early August.
Close to the surface the trowel is impeded by a network of tough stems.
Instead of growing upward, these formidable structures run parallel to the surface, or they run diagonally downward, or perhaps they may even point vertically downward, in defiance to the laws of geotropism.
The stems are anchored in the ground by rather stout roots which come off at various points, and each stem is terminated by a large bud.
Lateral buds are also to be found.
At this time of the year the overground portion is in a process of slow decomposition.
The decaying leaf-stalk gives no evidence of this underground activity, as a result of which we have great patches of Podophyllum early the following year.
While making these observations she had also noticed the False Solomon's Seal.
The flowering plants of the season had produced fruit, but there were also many younger plants which had not yet reached the flowering stage.
On none of the plants were long underground stems visible, but their rhizomes were all well supplied with 31 conspicuous buds.
It was worthy of notice that the plants which were too immature to produce flower and seed readily form several underground buds, indicating that the latter method of reproduction takes place at an earlier stage than that of seed formation.
Owing to this wise arrangement the danger of extermination from the ravages of enthusiastic collectors is much reduced, since the plants thus reproduce freely at this early stage of their existence without offering any temptation to the hunters of wild flowers, who abound in the woods at this time of year.
By far the most interesting observations on this underground method of reproduction were made on Ariscema triphyllwn.
On the 27th of July a locality was found on Crum creek where the plants were very plentiful and in the various stages of development.
At the time of year mentioned the fruit was formed, and while still green in color it showed a tendency to turn red.
Below was the thick corm and the two leaves were showing symptoms of decay by their yellowish tinge.
In some cases the leaves had already dropped off completely.
In one case the corm was of the same shape as that of the mature plant, namely, depressed globose, while in another the form was markedly different, being decidedly elongated and at the free end there was the appearance of a scar, indicating some previous attachment.
It was these longish corms which appeared to indicate some hidden meaning and which led her to contmue the observation in regard to their origin and significance.
Some years ago, in a short paper entitled Underground Runners, she had called attention to peculiar growths on Ariscema triphyllum as found in April.
At that time of year they were small knob-like projections on the corm, while in July these formations were at least an inch in length.
There may be several of them on the same corm, nor are they restricted to the mature plants.
This species also reproduces freely before it reaches the flowering age and thus decreases the chances of extermination.
This may partially explain the persistence of the plant in our woods in spite of the fact that it is one of the favorites of the enthusiastic collectors before mentioned.
She had found that these structures drop off very readily, and was much impressed with this peculiarity.
In fact, it seemed impossible to keep a corm and its growth intact.
On close inspection it appeared that there had been.
a separation between the main body of the corm and the structure even before they were disturbed.
The attachment was entirely superficial, being simply due to a layer of skin which loosely covered and hid the point of separation.
The body is somewhat bean-shaped, the bulk being made up of nourishing material, while the apex is occupied by the terminal bud and the scar at the base marks the point where it was originally connected with the parent plant.
A space already indicated the separation.
Although still loosely united by the skin above alluded to, each of the two structures is prepared for an independent existence.
On the 20th of September she again observed the patches with the view of determining the sequel of the interesting story.
By this time most of the plants had died down, the still remaining leaves were yellowish and m a state of decay.
The red fruits were numerous, and it did not seem as though the plants were in immediate danger of extermination, even if their sole method of propagation were by seed On uprootmg some, she had found that the growths had been completely severed from the parent corms, and that, in fact, they seemed to be mo^-ing away from them.
It is a significant fact that we do not find the Jack-m-the-pulpit growing close together in tufts, as would naturally follow were these short underground growths to develop in connection with the corms from which they spring.
The result of the spontaneous loosening leads naturally to a prevention of this condition -buture observations must determine just how far the young corms may travel from the spot where they had their origin.
The elongated form termmated by a point would offer but slight resistance to any force which would tend to carry them away.
Thus we find in this plant a rather unusual form of reproductive bodies in these underground sprouts and probably also an unusual method of dissemination A considerable amount of activity is manifested in the formation of these bodies, but this by no means represents the entire summer work of this typical sprmg flower, even aside from the fruit formation.
On removmg the decaymg stems from the plant, a large pinkish, wholesome bud comes mto view.
Within the three heavy protecting sheaths the Jack-m-the-pulpit is completely formed in miniature.
The leaf is unmistakable m its form, standing bolt upright, even emphasizing the peculiarity of the adult leaf.
Close to it is the inflorescence with a fully formed spathe and the flowers within are marked by well-defined masses of cells.
Thus all is in readiness for the first warm days of the following sprmg.
To some extent the same is true of Podophyllum.
In the vigorous buds termmatmg the underground stems, described above, the leaf and flower are also plainly formed.
It is also true of SmUadna racemosa, though perhaps to a less degree.
Here the future raceme is foreshadowed by the characteristic shape of the vegetative point We may safely conclude, therefore, that the summer months are also a busy season with these spring flowers.
We can appreciate how heavy the demands are on the vegetative activity of the leaves of Anscema tnphylhim when we remember that one current must carry nutrition to the forming fruit, at least in the seed-bearing plants, another stream travelling in the opposite direction must provide for the food supply of the miniature plant in the bud, and also for the formation of the underground reproductive bodies above described The season IS indeed one full of activity up to the time when its close IS marked by the fruit dropping heavily from the exhausted stalk.

The following were ordered to be printed: NEW POLYCHJETA FROM CALIFORNIA.
BY J. PERCY MOORE.
Some Polychseta gathered by Mr. E. C. Starks, at San Diego, California, were recently sent to me for determination by Prof. Harold Heath, of Leland Stanford, Jr., University.
Besides the eight herein described the collection includes about thirty species, most of which have been recorded from the Pacific coast by Johnson, Baird, Fewkes and others.
A full list of these wOl be published in another connection.
Diopatra californica n. s. (PI.
XXXVII, figs, l to 9.)
This species probably attains a length of 200 mm., although the only complete example measures only 110 mm.
long and 5 mm.
wide at the termination of the region of long branchise.
Prostomium small, mostly concealed by the bases of its appendages.
Frontal tentacles nearly in contact at their bases, fusiform, nearly equal to the prostomium in length.
Five principal tentacles similar in size, form and structure, arising in close contact from an arcuate area nearly covering the dorsum of the prostomium.
The basal fourth of each forming a conspicuous ceratophore divided into twelve to fom'teen rings equalling in length the head and frontal tentacles, the styles smooth, slender and tapering, apparently subequal, but the tips imperfect.
Eyes, a pair of prominent, slightly pigmented swellings nearly in contact and occup3dng most of the region of the head posterior to the tentacles.
Palps prominent, slightly bilobed processes bounding the mouth in front and in contact mesially.
Peristomium slightly shorter than the prostomium, which it embraces laterally.
Nuchal tentacles on its extreme anterior margin, and in line with the outer edge of the inner lateral tentacles.
The next two or three somites nearly equal the peristomium, and are rounded at the margins, while the remaining ones are much shorter, usually only about one-sixth or one-eighth of their width.
For about the first fifth of the body through the branchial region they are much flattened, but beyond that become gradually rounded and taper toward the tail, which is terminated by a bead-like pygidiimi bearing near the middle line a pair of delicate ventral cirri having a length equal to the last eight or nine somites.
The fii-st distinct parapodium is on the somite following the peristomium and consists of a setigerous body with three cirri, a postsetal lobe and a dorsal and ventral cirrus, all slender and conical and the latter about tT\-ice as long as the others.
The second and third parapodia are similar, with the dorsal cirri longer.
As far as the sixth or seventh the dorsal cirri continue to increase in length, then gradually diminish through the branchial region, and behind the latter remain small and slender to the end.
The ventral cirrus undergoes no change in the first four parapodia, but suddenly disappears in the fifth, where it is represented by a small glandular prominence, which increases in size and in the middle branchial region extends about one-fourth of the distance across the venter.
Beyond the branchial region it becomes smaller.
The postsetal lobe is likewise largest on the first four somites, and after reduction in the first few branchial segments, accompanied by a rotation ventrad, remains for the entire middle region of the body a blunt, moderately sized lobe ventro-caudad of the setse tuft.
In the posterior half of the body all parts of the parapodia are reduced and finally become mere low papillae.
In the region of their greatest development the branchiae are large and prominent, of a tall and slender form, much like a juniper tree, but with the spirally disposed branches more open in arrangement and, below them a distinctly annulated basal portion of the trunk.
They begin abruptly on the fourth parapodium, and the first is about three-fifths as long as the largest on the sixth or seventh parapodium.
Beyond this point they gradually decrease in size, the number of whorls of branches at the same time increasing, and their arrangement becoming more open.
By the twenty-seventh parapodium the spiral arrangement has disappeared altogether and the stem is simply curved, with the branches in a linear series on the convex side, an arrangement which begins to appear at the tip of some of the preceding gills, as though they were gradually unwinding.
The number of turns in different branchiae of the type is 11 on the first, 13 on the second, 15 on the third and foiu-th, 13 on the sixth, 10 on the tenth, 7 on the fifteenth, 4 on the twentieth, and none on the twenty-fifth.
Beyond the thirtieth parapodium each gill consists merely of a stalk, usually curved at the free end and bearing a terminal tuft of short branches, with a few others in a series below.
These gradually decrease in size, and by the fortieth parapodium are nearly or quite simple, and finally disappear by the sixtieth parapodium.
On the first four parapodia the setae are of two kinds, guarded uncini and simple slender setae.
The former are nearly colorless and have ' an incomplete transverse fracture or joint near the outer end and a strongly hooked tip with a stout subterminal spur; the guard extends somewhat beyond the terminal hook, and in the larger uncini at least reaches far down the shaft, along which its margin is distinctly free and denticulated.
They are arranged in three groups, a ventral of two small and slender uncini (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
2), a middle of one large stout (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
1) and three to five smaller ones, and a dorsal group of one or two which are usually longer, especially in the end piece, than any of the others and intermediate in thickness.
The more slender uncini, as shown in the ventral one figured, have the guards more prolonged.
Of the simpe setae (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
3) there are but one or two in each foot, and they arise just dorsad of the posterior row of uncini, the longest one reaching nearly or quite to the tip of the posterior lobe and nearly equalling in diameter all but the very stoutest uncini.
They are colorless, translucent, have barely visible oblique striations, become increasingly curved toward the tip, and when perfect are terminated by a small flexible filament.
On the tenth and succeeding parapodia the character of the setae is altogether changed.
There are no uncini, but in their place a spreading ventral vertical row of rather stout pale yellow strongly striated setae, four to six in number, with the outer ends broadened, flattened and rather strongly curved and tapered to a very acute point (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
4).
Dorsad of the postsetal lobe is a compact horizontal row of more numerous, longer, narrower and straighter setae of otherwise similar form and structure.
At the base of these, on the dorsal side, is a group of a few colorless spatulate setae with slender stems and abruptly broadened fork-shaped ends with seven tines (PL XXXVII, fig.
5).
By the thirty-fifth parapodium the setae are practically all confined to the horizontal dorsal fascicle and the spatulate setae are more numerous, and have broader more curved plates with as many as nine rather spreading tines.
Among them are also a few very small spatulate setae with ovoid blade and simple mucronate tip.
Posteriorly the setae, especially the simple ones, are reduced in number, become more slender and project far beyond the now very small ventro-caudal lobe.
By the seventy-fifth parapodium only about six such setae remain, and the spatulate setae have continued to widen and bear as many as eleven times.
Still further caudad the number of setae is further reduced and they become more slender.
The four anterior parapodia are each supported by about three slender aciculi which enter the base of the dorsal cirrus, and the same number of stouter ones in the setigerous lobe.
A single hooked and guarded aciculus appears ventrally at about the tenth parapodium, and by the twenty-fifth there are two very stout ones (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
6), and above these a vertical row of four or five less stout but more opaque and deeply colored aciculi, whose ends project freely as acute points which increase in length dorsally where they pass mto the regular series of setae.
Just beyond the point of their emergence is a slightly swollen deep brown spot, at which they readily break, indicating the existence of an imperfect joint (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
7).
The arrangement just described continues to the seventy-fifth somite at least, and probably considerably beyond, but the one hundred and twenty-fifth has two hooked aciculi, only two pointed ones and a single simply bent and unguarded one (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
8).
The jaws (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
9) are nearly black and stout.
The maxillse have short, broad carriers, not united in the middle, and their bases bear two prominent tubercles.
The next dorsal plate bears six or seven stout teeth, the next five on the left and seven on the right side, with a thin edentulous plate on each side.
The extra plate on the left side bears seven or eight teeth.
The mandibles have the terminal piece white and translucent, the carriers deep brown, loosely joined, very broadly rounded at the base and with a prominent longitudinal ridge.
Eunice biannulata n. s. (PI.
XXXVII, figs.
10-18; PI.
XXXVIII, fig.
42.)
] The type and largest example is 137 mm.
long and 5.3 mm.
between the tips of the parapodia at the widest point.
The prostomium is short and broad, the length barely exceeding one-half the width, the anterior border scarcely emarginated, but the anterior lobes or palpi swelling broadly ventrad and laterad, and separated by a distinct median ventral furrow passing backward to the mouth, while a faint transverse groove separates a small anterior from a larger posterior portion.
The tentacles arise in a nearly straight transverse line across the anterior portion of the white posterior half of the prostomium; the paired tentacles are in contact at their bases and are separated from the median tentacle by a distance about equalling the diameter of the latter.
Ceratophores all very low and broad ; styles constricted at the base, increasing gradually in diameter for one-fourth or one-fifth of their length and then tapering regularly to the end, simply articulated at the base, strongly beaded distally, the terminal joints caducious.
The first joint is always much the longest, the second very short and often imperfectly differentiated, the others increasing in length more or less irregularly to the end, giving the impression of a budding zone at the distal end of the basal segment.
The type specimen, which has suffered less from maceration than the others, has the median tentacle with twenty-one articulations reaching to the middle of VI, the inner lateral thirteen articulations reaching IV, and the outer lateral seven articulations reaching II.
Eyes black, somewhat elongated and crowded into the recess behind and between the bases of the lateral tentacles.
Peristomium considerably longer than the prostomium and slightly wider than its widest part, the anterior third distinctly separated dorsally as a ring which is sometimes elevated prominently above the head.
The principal ring presents the usual lateral or mandibular lobes and a smooth unfurrowed ventral lip.
The nuchal cirri have the characters of the tentacles, about equal the peristomium in length and have four to seven articulations.
Somite II is very short, scarcely more than one-fourth of the prostomium, V is slightly enlarged, and behind it the remaining somites are of nearly uniform length until they begin to diminish at the posterior end.
They are all smooth, simple and, especiall}^ in the branchial region, very clearly defined.
A short cylindrical pygidium bears a pair of short stiff cirri and laterad of these, but still ventral to the anus, a pair of long, slender, flexible cirri equalling the fifteen terminal segments.
The first parapodium is strictly ventro-lateral ; those following rise gradually to a half-way level.
In form they imdergo the changes usual in the genus, their chief characteristic being the prominence of the cirri, which are retained both dorsally and ventrally throughout the entire length of the worm.
The dorsal cirri are especially prominent and distinctly articulated anteriorly where each consists of a larger basal and two smaller jomts, together equalling the basal one.
About XXV one of these disappears, and a little farther on the other, the cirrus at the same time becoming more slender, but remaining about twice as long as the setigerous lobe; posteriorly, as the latter becomes smaller, the cirrus is relatively much more slender, three or four times the length of the setigerous lobe, and often famtly articulated.
The ventral cirrus also, while undergoing reduction in the middle region, exceeds the setigerous lobe throughout and always bears a small terminal joint.
The branchise are of typical uniserial pinnate form, the main stem curving mediad over the back and the end not being strongly bent upward.
The branches are long, slender and simple but never exceed the dorsal cirri; they arise from the main stem at right angles, not dichotomously, and curve slightly mesiad.
On two specimens they have the following average distribution and complexity : Begin on V with one filament, 3 on VI, 5 or 6 on VII, 6 to 8 from VIII to XXX, 4 or 5 to XXIX, 3 to XLII, 2 to XL VI, 1 to LIV, and cease by LV.
The first parapodium (III) is supported by a pair of pale yellow, simple pointed, sharply bevelled aciculi (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
13), and bears a small number of ventral compoimd and dorsal capillary setse, as well as one or two spatulate setse.
On IV the number of each kind, especially the last, is increased.
By VI the typical number, size and arrangement is attained.
The neuropodial aciculi are two or rarely three, stout and blunt, and in the case of one somewhat enlarged at the end (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
14).
Between XL and L a single ventral crochet appears, and the dorsal aciculi become tapered and slightly curved at the end (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
15).
The number of both compound and capillary setse decreases in this region, and in the posterior somites the latter seem to be absent altogether.
The compound setse also undergo a slight alteration in form.
The dorsal cirrus throughout is supported by about three slender aciculi.
The compound setse (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
10) are all rather slender, nearly colorless, have curved, finely striated stems moderately enlarged at the ends ; the appendix is not over two and one-half times the greatest diameter of the stem, the end is prominently hooked and bidentate, the accessory tooth distinctly triangular, guard narrow, scarcely covering the end.
From the posterior branchial region caudad the hook gradually diminishes, while the accessory tooth increases in size, the base of the appendix becomes more oblique, and the end of the shaft more strongly curved and thicker (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
11).
Throughout most of the branchial region the compound setse are arranged in a nearly complete circle somewhat open both dorsally and ventrally.
The capillary setse form a dense dorsal tuft reaching far beyond the compound setse.
They are pale greenish or nearly colorless, curved, finely pointed and faintly obliquely striated (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
12).
Back as far as the end of the branchial region they exhibit a slight enlargement in the outer third, but posteriorly are strictly capillary.
Spatulate setse (PI.
XXXVIII, fig.
42) form a close dorsal tuft at the base of the capillary.
They are colorless and very delicate, the ends half round with the outer angles prolonged and the distal margin folded and split mto nine or ten processes tipped with short filaments which bend abruptly inward nearly at a right angle.
These setae appear as a single one or two in the first parapodium and continue to C at least.
The jaws (PI.
XXXVII, fig.
18) are delicate and nearly colorless, except in the thickest parts, which are brow^l.
The maxillae are slender, acute and at the base extend beyond the small carriers laterally.
The basal dorsal plates have five or six teeth, and the much smaller anterior plates six and ten teeth on the left and right side respectively.
The extra plate on the left side has six teeth.
Even in alcohol the colors of this species are well preserved and rich.
The cuticle is everywhere smooth, polished and iridescent.
For most of its length the body is beautifully annulated with a rich brown on a creamywhite ground.
Each somite is marked on the dorsum with two narrow brown half rings separated from each other by an often impure area of the ground color, often divided by a narrow transverse brown line, and from the bands of the neighboring somites by a narrower, purer and more sharply defined intersegmental ring, also usually divided in the middle by a narrow transverse line.
A dark median dorsal line is also often evident.
The ventral colors are more obscure, but each somite in the anterior region has a dull brown cross-stripe.
Farther back the stripes break into a paired series of spots replaced posteriorly by a series of narrow median spots, three on each segment, a very small one in the furrow, followed by a considerable interval, then a larger spot, a small interval and then the largest, an oval spot which extends over nearly one-half the length of the somite.
The sides of the segments and, except anteriorly, the parapodia are colorless.
For about the first ten somites the brown color becomes richer and nearly continuous on the dorsum, except that the somewhat enlarged fifth segment is pure white and conspicuous and the ninth is chiefly white.
On the caudal region of the body the color approaches orange and becomes more suffused.
Except for a row of minute dots about its dorsal posterior margin and a pair of larger spots at the base of the caudal cirri, the pygidium is white.
The head is pale below with a brown spot in the ventral furrow; above its anterior half and a narrow median triangle extending from the base of the median tentacle to the posterior margin are brown, the rest pale.
All of the tentacles, tentacular cirri and the anterior dorsal cirri are similarly colored ; the ceratophore and all of the constrictions are brown, the enlargements white, resulting in a very sharply defined color annulation.
The longer anal cirri are chiefly brown with white rings.
Lumbriconereis erecta n. s. (PI.
XXXVII, figs.
19 to 22; PI.
XXXVIII, figs.
23 to 25.)
The form and general aspect are about as usual in the genus, though the unusual length and prominence of the lobes of the posterior parapodia overcomes the trimness general to these worms.
Full-grown specimens are 300 mm.
or more in length, and have a width of 3.5 mm.
without and 5 mm.
inckiding the parapodia.
The usual number of somites is about 330.
The prostomium is sugar-loaf shaped in outline, slightly depressed, the length slightly exceeding the basal width, the apex narrowly rounded; at the base it is slightly mortised into the peristomium above and on the sides is marked by a pair of faint oblique grooves, in front of which are a few pigment spots but no distinct eyes; on the middle of the lower surface is a shallow median depression.
Mouth large, bounded laterally by a pair of prominent L-shaped lobes connected with the peristomium, a much wrinkled fold of which bounds the mouth posteriorly.
The peristomium is divided into two rings (perhaps somites) by a furrow which is very distinct above, obsolete below; the first ring equals the first setigerous somite, the second is two-thirds as long.
Body nearly terete, very slightly depressed toward the ends; the somites all well marked, simple, smooth except for a very slightly raised welt around the middle ; their length nearly uniform, from one-third to one-fifth their width, which is greatest at the middle.
Toward the posterior end of the body there is a faint neural groove.
The pygidium is a small platform ventral to the anus and provided with a pair of prominent short and thick bifid cirri, the median lobes of which come into contact in the median line.
In the middle region of the body the parapodia are situated about midway between the dorsal and ventral surfaces which are equally convex, but toward the ends they assume a lower level and the ventral surface becomes flattened.
The parapodia (PI.
XXXVII, figs.
19-21) have a short, thick rounded base, a very small notopodial tubercle which receives four to six aciculi, a presetal lobe which is very short, thick and rounded throughout the series, and a promment postsetal lobe which gradually increases in size from before backward, and in the middle and posterior regions has the form of a long finger-like process which generally bends abruptly upward at a right angle and rises above the back.
The setae are of the usually acute, winged and the hooded, hooked forms and vary greatly in details and particularly in the degree of curvature and geniculation.
The anterior parapodia contain the acute type only (PI.
XXXVIII, figs, 23 and 24), at first in a somewhat broken fan-shaped tuft, but soon in a dorsal group of longer and middle and ventral groups of shorter setae.
At about XLV, guarded imcini (PI, XXXVIII, fig.
25) appear in the ventral group, and by L are alone present to the number of four or five, which is further reduced to tw^o or even one posteriorly.
The ventral setae of the dorsal bundle exhibit a reduction in size at about L, and by LX have given place to uncini, but the slender setae do not altogether disappear until about LXXV, from which point backward the uncini become stouter and the number gradually reduced to from one to three in each parapodium.
The jaws are coarse, black and very brittle.
The mandibles (PL XXXVn, fig 22) are pale, stout and broad, with the two halves strongly united, especially by transverse striated bands across the end pieces.
The bases are broad and roughly lammated.
Much of the original color has been lost, but the head and anterior region of the body retains a rich bronze with a beautiful blue and green iridescence; the posterior part is dull brown, due to heavy masses of pigment which are scattered everywhere through the deeper integument, but especially in a narrow transverse band and a pair of dorso-lateral spots on each somite.
Cirratulus spirabranchus n. s. (PL XXXVIII, figs.
26 and 27.)
Form rather stout, thickest in middle and tapering almost equally both ways.
The type is 105 mm.
long and 5.5 mm.
in diameter at the widest part.
Prostomium elongated, pointed and slightly depressed, wdth a short oblique groove on each side above and near the union with the peristomium.
No eyes visible.
Peristomium enlarged, its length equal to six succeeding somites, somewhat irregularly divided into three or four rings of which the last is much longer than the others.
There are about 300 setigerous somites, of which the first three or four are longer than the others.
Nearly terete, but slightly flattened ventrally where the muscle coats are considerably thickened particularly toward the ends.
All somites clearly marked, but short and uniannulate.
The anus is a large dorsal slit reaching through 7 or 8 faintly marked somites and followed by a minute tubercle-like pygidium.
The branchiae are numerous and crowded and usually more or less spirally coiled.
They differ much in size, probably, however, only as a result of loss and regeneration, but their length does not exceed about five times the diameter of the body.
Beginning with the first setigerous a pair occurs on every somite except the last thirty, arising immediately dorsad of the notopodial setae or from the margin of the elevated band just above them.
On the seventh setigerous somite occur the special branchia?
in a pair of dense tufts of about 20, arranged in two transverse rows which nearly meet medially.
They are mostly smaller than the ordinary branchiae, and owing to the crowding of this region usually appear to cover two somites, either VII and VIII or VIII and IX."
The setigerous tubercles (PI.
XXXVIII, figs, 26, 27) are separated by a smooth space about 3 or 4 times as broad as they, and both are placed on a wide elevated band, the dorsal margin of which rises prominently about the notopodial tubercles and bears the branchiae on its edge.
The usual spines and capillary setse are present, distributed as follows: Anterior to somite XL the latter only occur, but at XL or thereabout small, nearly colorless spines appear among the capillary bristles in the neuropodial fascicles; by L there are usually five, quite distinct and dark colored, though small; they alternate with the setse, and as the latter diminish the former increase in number, the maximum of six being found from about C to CL, behind which the capillary setse have nearly or quite disappeared, and the number of the spines becomes again reduced to four or five, a number which remains constant to the end, though further diminution in size occurs.
In the notopodial fascicles the spmes are smaller, slightly more numerous and first appear a little more caudad than in the ventral fascicles, Cirratulus luxuriosus n. s. (PI.
XXXVIII, figs.
28 to 31.)
Form slender throughout, thickest at about end of anterior third (somite C), tapering thence very gently to posterior end.
The type and largest specimen is 110 mm.
long and 4.5 mm.
in diameter at somite C. In the best-preserved specimens the body is strongly convex above, concave below and angulated at the setse levels, particularly the neiu-opodial, Prostomium about three-fifths as long as broad, rounded anteriorly, depressed, slightly retracted within the peristomium, grooved below in the middle line, thus leaving a pair of lateral palplike thickenings which bound the mouth above; no eyes nor sensory slits apparent.
Peristomium somewhat inflated, about twice as long as the prostomium and divided into two or three annuli.
Setigerous annuli numerous (358 in the type), all very short and distinct, those of the posterior third rather longer and with faint indications of irregular division into two wings.
The branchise form a conspicuous tangled mass, and even in the alcoholic specimens are very long, equalling ten times the diameter of the body but, unlike C. spirabranchus , exhibiting little tendency to coil spirally.
They begin on the first setigerous somite in contact with the notopodia above, but continually rise to a higher level, until toward the posterior end they are much nearer to the dorsal middle line than to the setse.
To the 200th somite at least a pair of branchise occurs on every somite, but for the next 70 or 80 on every second, third or fourth somite only; there is no diminution in size posteriorly.
The special branchise are in a pair of close tufts crowded on the sides principally of the fourth setigerous somite.
The number appears to be 12 or 14 on each side, but cannot be ascertained with certainty.
Anus rather small, nearly transverse, widely open and succeeded by a small median ventral tubercle.
The setigerous tubercles (PI.
XXXVIII, figs.
28 to 30) are very small, not elevated on any special muscular band, though appearing at the lateral angles posteriorly, and are well separated throughout.
The first 30 somites bear capillary setae only.
Spines appear at that point in the ventral fascicle and soon become thick and dark brown.
By XL there are usually four of these spines associated with capillary setae, but the number soon becomes reduced to three, the number of capillary setae simultaneously diminishing.
From CXX to CL there are two spines and the capillary setae have disappeared ; beyond CL there is one (or rarely two) large, stout, nearly black spine which continues to increase gradually in size.
Toward the posterior end a reverse change begins, and behind CCC there are usually two comparatively slender and pale spines.
In the notopodial fascicles spines appear later, the first at about L. At about C three small pale spines usually occur, with the capillary setae.
The fascicles undergo changes analogous to those just described, but in the same segment the spines are almost always more numerous, not over one-third as large and always associated with capillary setae.
Maldane disparidentata n. s. (PI.
XXXVIII, figs.
28 to 31.)
The length of complete examples is from 100 to 150 mm., and 4 to 6 mm.
in diameter in the somewhat contracted state; some fragments indicate specimens of larger size.
Probably owing in part to contraction, as indicated by a distinct fold of the first setigerous somite which overlaps the head ventrally, the latter is truncated with little obliquity; its V ntral length, including the united prostomium and peristomium, is scarcely one-third more than the dorsal.
Cephalic plate broadly oblong-elliptical, its width at least four-fifths its length, the surface smooth and slightly elevated in the center.
The frontal ridge low, broad and inconspicuous; beginning just anterior to this elevation and ending anteriorly in the palpode ; its length equal to one-third the cephalic plate; posteriorly one-third as wide as the plate, gradually widening for its posterior half, then suddenly expanding into the palpode which is broad, thick, rounded, smooth and separated from the cephalic margin laterally by only a slight emargination.
Sensory slits short, sharply defined but inconspicuous.
Cephalic margin nowhere much produced, low and thick, probably in part the result of contraction; a pair of lateral clefts divide the posterior one-third from the anterior two-thirds.
The former is lower, embraces the latter at the sides and has its margin divided into about fifteen low, broad, truncate teeth, very irregular and inconstant in different individuals, but always diminishing in size and distinctness toward the posterior middle line and often grouped in pairs.
The lateral lobes, which reach forward to the palpode, are considerably more elevated and bear five or six larger, more prominent, rounded teeth.
The mouth is a conspicuous opening bounded behind by a transverse fold and laterally by distinct thickened lobes.
Behind it is a distinct peristomial half-ring rendered more conspicuous by contraction.
There are nineteen setigerous somites, the first seven thick-walled and largely glandular, the first six strongly biannulate with the anterior ring larger and setigerous.
This region is usually slightly depressed with each of the first six somites about as long as wide, but the uniannular seventh only ec[ualling the larger anterior ring of the others.
Behind VIII the somites increase gradually in length and become somewhat narrower to XVI, which is three times as long as wide; XVIII, XIX and XX become successively shorter.
From the eighth to the nineteenth inclusive the parapodia are posterior in position, and the more anterior are situated on complete glandular zones which soon become incomplete and restricted to the lateral faces of the somites.
Distinct constrictions occur at the in termetameric furrows which are rendered much more conspicuous by the prominent tori preceding them.
The surface of all somites is more or less annularly furrowed and bears numerous small glandular and sensory papillae.
The last somite (XXI) bears no setse and is smooth and uniannulated.
Caudally it enlarges and passes gradually into the anal funnel, dorsad of which the anus is situated behind a somewhat wrinkled anterior fold.
The anal funnel consists of two parts, the ventral funnel proper, the cavity of which reaches to the anterior end of the anal segment while the margin is even and not at all flaring, and the dorsal platform, which arises within the dorsal part of the ventral funnel and spreads in a flat, broad petaloid form vertically behind the anus.
The margins of both parts are slightly irregular, but entirely without lobes or processes.
On the anterior somites the parapodia are strictly lateral, on the posterior ventro-lateral and more prominent.
Somite II bears setae alone.
III to XX both dorsal setse and ventral uncini.
The setae are of three forms which, however, vary and intergrade.
The several kinds arise in more or less distinct fascicles, but spread in such a manner that they appear at the surface in pairs or triplets composed of one of each kind; thus on II they form a fan-shaped figure of about 25 pairs, on III about 15, on IV 12, on V 10 and a more irregular arrangement in triples on the abdominal segments.
Slender capillary wingless setae, rather abruptly attenuated at the surface of the body wall, occur in all setigerous somites.
The anterior ones project about one-third as far ar the larger setse, but in the posterior segments they become much longer and filamentous.
Winged setse also occur in all somites.
They are about three or four times the diameter of the smaller ones in their exposed parts and quite deeply colored, nearly straight, tapered to an acute tip, broadly winged on one margin and very slightly on the other.
The stoutest ones occur in the posterior thoracic somites, where also setse of intermediate form are present, some of the smaller ones having short basal wings.
In the abdominal bimdles most of the larger setse are provided with delicate doubly spirally fringed tips (PI.
XXXVIII, fig.
35) which differ considerably in length, the longest in the middle abdominal region forming more than one-half of the exposed portion.
Posteriorly the number of setse is reduced, the filamentous ones predominating.
The uncini are all rather stout and of a deep yellow color; 7 or 8 occur on III, about 10 on V, and about 35 on VIII and the following somites.
On somites III to V the uncini have the form shoTvm in PI.
XXXVIII, fig.
32.
The stems are very slightly curved, strongly striated and have a scarcel}^ perceptible shoulder; the heads are but little enlarged with a blunt pointed beak bent at an angle of 100° to 120°; a crest composed of two rows of teeth, the anterior with a few large teeth in the middle, the posterior and lateral smaller, and a simple guard of about 12 spreading hairs ending at the tip of the beak.
On the remaining somites the crochets form a much longer row and have the stems more curved, the shoulder larger, the head more expanded, the beak much longer, more acute, much more strongly hooked at an acute angle, the crest more elevated, with the smaller teeth in more numerous rows and more closely embracing the base of the beak, and the guard arising from a distinct flange below a re-entering angle (PI.
XXXVIII, fig.
33).
This species is represented by a large number of examples.
Terebella (Schmardanella) californica n. .=.
(PI.
XXXVIII, figs.
36, 37.)
This species has the general aspect of Amphiti'ite spiralis Johnson, from which it is readily separated by the much smaller number of setigerous somites in addition to other characters.
The type measures 75 mm.
from the pygidium to the tip of the prostomium, but another less perfect specimen is nearly twice as large; the diameter at X is 3.3 mm.
The prostomium is prominent, little arched, projects forward and is faintly trilobed its margin slightly revolute and its lateral portion distinctly reflexed.
Eyes absent.
Tentacles very numerous, deeply grooved, arising from the posterior border of the prostomium for its entire width in three or four transverse crowded rows, behind which is a slightly elevated border.
Most of the tentacles are colorless, but usually some are pale brown.
Mouth large with a broad peristomial lower lip.
Peristomium about as long as succeeding somites, distinctly visible as a ring both above and below.
Branchise two pairs on the posterior part of somites II and III, the first just anterior to the first seta3 tuft, the second above and behind it.
All of the branchise are prominent, and of about equal size.
They are of a spreading bushy form; the main stem very short, dichotomy occurring almost immediately and the outermost branch again dividing at once, so that three main branches appear to arise almost separately.
After about four or five dichotomous divisions, which are usually unequal, one or two uregular divisions occur, the result being a very large number of terminal twigs.
When contracted the minor divisions coil inward toward the axis, so that the gill presents a very compact appearance.
There is, however, much irregularity in this respect, some of the filaments merely shortening, others coiling spirally.
The body is slender and club-shaped, nearly terete throughout the abdominal region, gently tapered to the anus and the anterior end of the thorax somewhat enlarged.
The thoracic segments increase slightly in diameter to about X, and then decrease very gradually into the abdominal region.
The dorsum is regularly arched, the venter somewhat angulated, fiattened or slightly convex, according to the state of the specimen.
Above the somites are somewhat indistinctly separated and somewhat irregularly divided into three rings which are usually again biannulate.
On the ventral half the intersegmental fm'rows are well marked and the somites only biannulated.
This region is also rough and thickened, and separated from the faintly granulated, thin-walled dorsal region by a longitudinal groove below which is a ridge-like row of glandular thickenings.
The first one or two ventral plates are very short.
They increase in length to the tenth, and in width decrease regularly and gradually to the sixteenth, which is square, while the tenth is twice, and the fifth three times as wide as long.
Usually a cross-furrow divides each one and the surface is wrinkled.
On most specimens the fifth or sixth plate is sunken below the general surface.
Behind the sixteenth they become very small, but may be traced for some distance further.
The thorax passes very gradually into the abdomen, which is very prommently arched and thin-walled, the somites numerously and finely ringed and indistinctly 32 separated from one another.
At the posterior end the metamerism becomes obscure and the pygidium is truncated.
Throughout the thoracic and much of the abdominal region the uncinigerous tori are prominent.
They begin on V, increase in length to about XIII, remain practically uniform to about XX, and then very gradually diminish, the last thoracic beuig about equal to the seventh.
As they become smaller and the ventral plates narrower, the tori are carried more and more to the ventral surface, imtil in the middle abdominal region they form bead-like swellings on a pair of muscular ridges separated by a narrow median groove.
Toward the posterior end they^ are barely recognizable.
Setigerous tubercles begin on IV, and continue for from twenty-three to twenty-eight somites, tw^entysix being the most frequent number.
They stand out prominently from the dorsal end of the tori, especially the anterior ones, which bear the greatest number of setae.
Whitish glandular thickenings occur just dorsadiof the setae lobes as far as somite XXII and prominent nephridial papillae from VII to XX inclusive, and less prominently and regularly on some of the succeeding somites.
The setse (PI, XXXVIII, fig.
36) are noteworthy for the prominence of their pennant-like fringed tips.
They are arranged as a single row of larger ones flanked on one or both sides by a row of smaller setae.
The former are straight or slightly cm'ved, with about one-half of the exposed portion included in a loose sheath beginning abruptly and tapering to the terminal pennant which begins as a sudden, much flattened, very thin angulated expansion, curved strongly to one side, tapered to a delicate point and prominently fringed on one margin.
The smaller setae are little more than one-half as thick as their exposed parts, only half as long as the larger.
Their form is generally similar, but the' sheath is less evident and the tips broader, longer and more abruptly bent to one side.
Setae of the fu'st tuft are more slender and of the posterior ones fewer than elsewhere.
The uncini (PI.
XXXVIII, fig.
37) are biserial and opposite on XI and all following somites; uniserial on those anterior to XI.
They have a rather short base strongly convex below with a prominent toe, a small posterior ligament process and a subrostral process with a guard; the sinus is narrow with subparallel sides, the beak long, acute and strongly hooked and the crest prominent, elevated and composed of three or four transverse tooth rows, the lowermost large.
On the posterior somites the uncini are small, lack the posterior ligament process and are consequently less angulated and they have a larger number of teeth in the crest.
Distylia rugosa n. s. (PI.
XXXVIII, figs.
38 to 41.)
This is a large, handsome species, somewhat resembling Bispira polymorpha Johnson, but differing from that species in the fewer spiral tm-ns of the branchial base, the greater number of branchial radioles, the arrangement of the eyes, the form of the spatulate thoracic setae and pick-shaped uncini and probably the deep rugous dorsal folds.
Exclusive of the branchiee, the type is 67 mm.
long, the width at the posterior end of the thorax to the middle abdominal region being 8 mm.
and the depth at the same points 6 and 5 mm.
respectively.
The ventral ends of the stiff, cartilage-like branchial bases are prolonged and spirally coiled, but make only 1^ tm-ns.
The radioles, which reach a length of 22 mm.
at the dorsal and somew^hat less at the ventral end of the series, arise to the number of 58 on the left, 55 on the right, in a crowded, closely interlocking double row from the entire distal margin of the basal lobes.
Each is strictly simple and perfectly free from the others to the base; the outer surface is rounded and the inner bears the numerous barbs, which have a length about twice the diameter of the radiole, in a crowded double series for its entire length except a short naked terminal region.
In this species the eyes are less perfect but far more numerous than in D. polymorpha, the number on each radiole approximating 100.
They are very irregularly distributed in groups on both margins, most plentifully on the distal half, where a very constant group of large eye-spots occurs just proximad of the naked tip.
In the type the branchiae are pale-colored, each plimie with three brown spots, one near the base and two m the outer half ; the other specimen has the gills almost continuously pale reddishbrown mottled with white, especially on the basal half.
The palpal membrane has a free margin completely encirclmg the bases of the branchial radioles within.
It extends around the sides of the mouth, ventrad to which the two halves meet as a pair of vertical plates contiguous to the middle line, and entering the ventral collar incision partly join the somewhat swollen bases of the ventral collar lobes.
The tentacles are about as long as the basal branchial lobes, and have the basal half broadly margined, the distal half filamentous.
The collar is rather thick, stiff, flarmg and prominent throughout its extent.
The dorsal opening is equal to nearly | the body width at the peristomium, with the broadly rounded dorsal lobes bounding it slightly, curving around the dorsal side of the first pair of setae fascicles, but free from them.
The ventral opening is narrow but deep and, as mentioned above, is partly occupied by the ventral prolongations of the circumoral membrane; on each side of it are the short, broad and thick ventral lobes.
There is a pair of slight lateral emarginations, but no well-marked incisions.
Except at the rounded peristomium the body is depressed.
It increases in width to the end of the thorax, from which point it diminishes very gently to the posterior one-tenth or beyond, and then very rapidly to the small pygidium, on each side of which is a conspicuous cluster of numerous brown pigmented eye-spots.
There are 8 setigerous • thoracic and 107 abdominal segments.
The coalesced peristomium and first setigerous somite are about twice as long as succeeding somites.
Besides the collar they bear an undivided, very thick ventral plate, which is about twice as long and much wider than any succeeding thoracic plate, but about equal in the latter respect to the first abdominal.
The remaining thoracic plates are about equal in length, but from the third, which is the narrowest, they increase gradually in width to the last.
Owing to lateral extensions anterior to the uncinigerous tori, the margms of the ventral plates are strongly serrated.
The abdominal ventral plates are also thick and occupy about threefifths of the ventral area.
Widest at the anterior end, the first 15 or 20 become gradually narrower, after which there is no change until at the posterior end of the body they diminish correspondingly.
Throughout they are sharply defined by straight margins.
In the alcoholic specimens all of the segments are short and sharply defined, and an " extensive area on the dorsal surface is thrown into very deep rugous glandular folds, occupying on the posterior one-third of the type specimen the entire width of the dorsal area, but anteriorly becoming lower and more and more restricted to the middle region imtil they finally fade out.
On the second specimen they are less conspicuously developed, but are otherwise similar.
A well-marked f a cal groove divides the abdominal ventral plates into equal halves to the first, cuts this obliquely to the left and passes dorsad in the thoracico-abdominal groove to the level of the abdominal setaj tufts, and then obliquely across the last thoracic somite dorsal to its setae tuft to the middle line, along which it proceeds as a deep and conspicuous groove to the dorsal collar openmg.
All setae tufts are large and prominent, the abdominal strictly vertical and ventral, the thoracic dorsal and slightly ob'ique, except the first, which is nearly horizontal, entirely free from the collar and sliglitly smaller than the others.
The imcinigerous tori are also well marked, on the thoracic i^omites meeting the ventral plates below and slightly hooked backward above.
The first pair, on the second setigerous somite, are the longest; the seventh and last about three-fourths as long; reduction in length takes place at both ends and the setae tufts descend to a correspondingly lower level.
All abdominal tori are shorter than the last thoracic and they diminish gradually and constantly to the posterior end.
They are especially prominent dorsally where they terminate in a prominent projection marked with a conspicuous black spot.
All setae are nearly colorless, translucent and striated.
Those of the first or collar fascicle are all of one form, slender, narrowly lanceolate, slightly curved and with a single narrow wing, but differ considerably in length.
On other thoracic somites those in the dorsal rows of the bundles are similar (PI.
XXXVIII, fig.
38), but the ventral ones (PI.
XXXVIII, fig.
39) are shorter, spatulate, doubly winged, and have acute but not mucronate tips; they differ somewhat in curvature and breadth of wings, but the one figured is typical.
The abdominal setae are again all of one kind, rather more broadly lanceolate than, but otherwise similar to, those of the collar fascicle.
The thoracic uncmi are of two kinds — large aviculae and smaller pick-shaped hooks, arranged in opposed parallel rows, there being 105 of each on II, 97 on V, and 90 on VIII on the type specimen.
The aviculse (PI.
XXXVIII, fig.
40) are of a very pale yellow, the bases long, slender, slightly curved ; the neck and head prominent and erect, slightly inclined forward; the breast prominent, hemispherical; the neck slightly tapered and about as long as thick at the base, the head scarcely enlarged with the rather stout but acute beak strongly bent downward, the crest little elevated and forming a dense sheath of fine spines arranged in numerous transverse and longitudinal rows closely appressed on the upper half of the beak.
Abdominal aviculse differ only in their somewhat shorter bases and less prominent breasts.
They are not associated with pick-shaped uncini and the type specimen has about 80 in each torus.
The pick-shaped uncini (PI.
XXXVIII, fig.
41) have stems about as long as the bases of the aviculae, but much more slender; they are nearly straight, but more or less slightly enlarged and bent at about the beginning of the outer one-third.
The tip curves to a short blunt point enclosed within a loose expanded hood, from which arises a delicate, colorless, very slender process, making an angle of about 60° with the stem.
Except as already described for the branchiae, all pigment has faded out.
Distylia Quatrefages is employed instead of the earlier Bis'pira Kroyer, because the author of the latter seems never to have applied the name to any species.

THE FISHES OF NANTUCKET.
BY DR. BENJAMIN SHARP AND HENRY W. FOWLER.
Fish are taken in Nantucket by hand-lines, trolling, litie-trawls, driftand set-nets and pounds or traps.
Hand-lining is employed for scup, plaice, flatfish, cod, haddock, and in times past for dogfish and halibut.
The line-trawls are used in the spring and fall for cod and haddock, drift-nets in the spring for mackerel, set-nets in the summer and fall for bluefish and bonito.
The two poimds fixed in water of about 4 fathoms are inside, that is on the west of Great Point, about midway between the Koskata U. S. Life Saving Station and Great Point Lighthouse.
These pounds are the property of the Petrel Fishing Company, which employs a small steamer and a sailboat.
Every species of commercial fish found about the island has been taken in the pound, and many others mentioned in this list.
Bluefish are very rarely found in them.
During the spring of the year the steamer Petrel is employed drifting for mackerel off the south side of the islands of Nantucket and Tuckernuck.
During the summer she steams around the island for bluefish and an occasional trip is made for swordfish, when she cruises some 30 or 40 miles from the land.
The bluefish are taken by sweeping nets around a school of fish.
This is done by dories which put out from the steamer when a school is discovered.
The steamer Waquoit is also employed in fishing for mackerel, swordfish and bluefish.
This steamer and the Petrel are the only two steam fishing-boats owned in Nantucket.
The line-trawls are used in the spring and fall in the cod and haddock fisheries.
These are set from dories which put out from the beaches on the south and east sides of the island when the weather permits, and on returning are hauled up out of the surf to a safe place and the fish carted to town.
At Quidnet there are a number of houses where the Portuguese salt codfish.
Salting and drying codfish is also carried on by a number of fishermen from the Cape.
They have established a small village on Coatuc ("New Chatham"), and in catboats sail out of the "opening" at the head of the harbor and fish off the eastern side of the island.
A gasoline-power boat, the San Antonio, has recently been built by some enterprising Portuguese on Nantucket, and is employed in various kinds of fishing about the island.
The set-nets, used in the fall for catching bonito, are hung in the "Cod" of the Bay — the sheet of water enclosed by the arm of the island called Great Pomt.
Collections of Nantucket fishes have been made by the senior writer and presented by him to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
The * affixed to certain species indicates that material from this source has been examined.
In conclusion, we wish to thank the members of the "Petrel Company " for their kindness and interest in helping us in this work.
PETROMYZONTIDiE.
Petromyzon marinus Linnaeus.
(" Lamprey.")
Specimen taken in the pound, April 28, 1904, about 3 feet in length.
GALEORHINID^.
♦Mustelus canis (Mitchill).
Found associated with Squalus acanthias.
Prionace glauca (Linnceus).
("Blue Dog."
"Man-eater.")
Caught with the sand shark (Carcharias littoralis), but by no means so common.
"Sharking" is one of the sports of the island.
Those caught are not used now commercially.
Some years ago, when "sharking" was carried on regularly at Wawinet, a village at the head of the harbor, the livers of all the sharks caught were saved, dried out in the sun and the oil shipped away.
Carcharliinus obscurus (Le Sueur) 7 About 6 or 8 examples probably of this or some closely related species have been taken at various times at or near Great Point.
A large example was taken by the senior writer during the summer of 1877, weighing 650 pounds.
It measured 11 feet 6 inches.
SPHYRNID^.
*Sphyrna zygaena (Linnaeus).
Two examples seen.
One washed ashore many years ago, and another taken in a set-net September 25, 1903.
The latter examined by the junior writer.
ALOPIID^.
Alopias vulpes (Gmelin).
("Thrasher.")
Two examples seen.
Both taken at Great Point, one with a line and the other in the pound.
The tail of the latter measured 7h feet.
LAMNID^.
Isurus dekayi (Gill)?
("Mackerel Shark.")
Taken in the spring in the mackerel drift-nets.
CARCHARIID^.
*Carcliarias littoralis (Mitchill).
("Sand Shark.")
This is the commonest shark in these waters.
They are taken on lines and sometimes rolled up in the set-nets.
Occasionally in the harbor.
A small one was taken a few years ago in one of the doclcs.
It measm-ed about 5 feet.
SQUALID.^.
Squalus acanthias Linnseus.
(" Dog Fish.")
They breed on the bar in May.
Some years ago they were regularly fished for by sailboats.
They were so plentiful that it was the custom to break off the barb of the hook to make it easier to get the fish off when caught.
They are a great nuisance to the mackerel fishermen, not only in tearing the nets, but in mangling the mackerel already in the net.
In October, 1903, for two or three days they filled up the pounds.
RAJIDJE.
Kaja erinacea Mitchill.
(" Skate.")
Common all about the island and associated with — Eaja laevis (Mitchill).
(" Skate.")
MYLIOBATID^.
Ehinoptera bonasus (Mitchill).
Only one specimen seen.
Taken in the pound, October 16, 1902.
ACIPENSERIDJB.
Acipenser sturio Linnseus.
("Sturgeon.")
Often seen "breaking" (jumping out of water) on still days off the east end of the island.
Occasionally taken in the nets.
ANGUILLID^.
*Anguilla chrisypa Rafinesque.
("Eel.")
Taken by spearing in shallow water in the harbor and in Madequet " creek/' a tide-water stream at the western end of the island.
They are also taken at night torching and with the " bob."
In winter holes are cut in the ice and the eel-spear thrust through into the mud and many eels taken.
This was especially resorted to in the long freeze-up of 1904.
A perfect albino specimen was taken by Henry Folger in the spring of 1903 and is now in the Academy's coUection.^ ELOPIDJE.
♦Elops saurus Linnaeus.
(" Lady Fish.")
Taken in the pound in October, 1903.
CLUPEID^.
Clupea harengus Linnaeus.
("Herring.")
Taken in the spring by opening the south head of the Hummock pond (fresh-water) to the sea.
As they rim in they are scooped out with hand-nets.
Many remain through the summer in the pond after it is closed.
They are also taken in the pound.
Pomolobus pseudohareiigus (Wilson) ?
(" Herring.")
Alosa sapidissima (Wilson).
("Shad.")
A few taken in the poimd in the spring of 1901.
Tradition says that they were common about the island before the bluefish became so numerous.
Thirty-six taken April 29, 1904, and 30 taken May 7, 1904, in the poimds.
*Brevoortia tyrannus (Latrobe).
(" Menhaden.")
SALMONID^.
Salmo salar Linnaeus.
("Salmon.")
One weighing 3^ pounds taken off Tuckernuck in the mackerel driftnets of the Waquoit on the night of May 6 and 7, 1904.
PCECILIID^.
♦Fundulus majalis (Walbaum).
(" Cat Fish.")
Caught with the following about the wharves l^y boys, and the name given as they are caught for cats' food.
♦Fundulus heteroclitus macrolepidotus (Walbaum).
("Cat Fish.")
Abundant about the wharves.
Used with the above for bait for plaice fish.
SYNGNATHIDJE.
Siphostoma fuscum (Storer).
(" Pipe Fish.")
Conunon on the bars in August and September.
Associated with and closely resembling floating eel-grass.
This is undoubtedly a case of color and form protection, *A spotted eel about four feet long has been noticed by the senior writer.
Three specimens were seen at different times, one on exhibition four or five years ago and two were seen in October, 1902, which were sent to Albany by Sydney Fisher.
They were called Conger Eels by the fishermen, and thought to be related to Murcena ocellata.
ATHERINIDu?E.
♦Menidia notata (Mitchill).
BBLONIDiE.
*Tylosurus acus (Lacdpfede).
("Bill Fish.")
Rare.
One taken September 23, 1901, and another August, 1903, in the pound.
SOOMBRID^.
Scomber scombrus Linnaeus.
("Mackerel.")
Caught in drift-nets which are set at night off the south side of the island in the spring of the year.
Sometimes in the fall they are taken on hand-lines in Nantucket Sound.
Some taken also in the pounds.
First taken (in the pound) in 1904, April 28.
On April 29, 32 taken; on May 6 and 7, 160 taken by steamer Waquoit "drifting" off south side.
Thunnus thynnus (Linnaeus).
(" Horse Mackerel.")
Caught around the island by the Petrel with swordfish gear, and also in the pounds.
Schools of 60 or 70 have been seen.
Sarda sarda (Bloch).
("Bonito.")
Caught in set-nets through September and October, rarely caught trolling.
Scomberomorus maculatus (Mitchill).
("Spani.
'ih Mackerel.")
TBICHIURID^.
*Trichiurus lepturus Linnaeus.
(" Hair Tail. ')
Three large examples secured, four in all, taken in the pound in July, 1903.
XIPHIID^.
Xiphias gladius Linnaeus.
("Sword Fish.")
Common in July -off the south side of the island, from 20 to 40 miles from the land.
They are taken by the ordinary swordfish gear by the steamers Petrel and Waquoit.
Many years ago sailboats from Nantucket made a business of swordfishing.
CARANQID^.
*Seriola zonata (MitchiU).
("Rudder Fish.")
Taken in pound, 1903.
*Caranx crysos (Mitchill).
("Yellow Tail.")
Taken in pound, 1903.
Selene vomer (Linnaeus).
("Moon Fish.")
A small example taken in the pound, September 26, 1901.
Trachinotus carolinus (Linnaeus).
(" Pompano.")
Two examples taken in the pound, September, 1901.
POMATOMIDiE.
Pomatomus saltatrix (Linnseus).
("Blue Fish.")
These are taken by trolling in the Rips— Muskeget Rip, Great Point Rip and Bass Rip (off Sankaty Head)— and for many years great numbers were caught by boats in the opening which broke through some fifty years ago between Nantucket and Tuckernuck.
This place is now given up.
When the bluefish first became common about the island, in the early 60's, they were caught in the harbor, now they are rarely seen there.
Set-nets were also used, but of late these are but little used.
The Petrel gets them off the south and east ends of the island by means of sweep-nets.
When a school is seen— and this can be done at some distance by the terns which hover over them— the net is shot from dories and pulled around the school, the fish in darting away get gilled and are then taken from the net.
"Heaving and hauling"— i.e., throwing a drail or leaded hook from the shore and hauling in— is now occasionally done at the south shore, and on September 26, 1903, an example weighing 27 pounds was taken.
This is considerably larger than the largest heretofore reported by Jordan and Evermann, Food and Game Fishes, 1902, p. 321, where one weighing 22 pounds and measuring 3 feet in length is mentioned.
Up to 1880 hundreds were often caught in an afternoon from the south shore.
C BNTROL OPHID^.
*Palinuriclitliys peroiformis (MitchiU).
(" Rudder Fish.")
STROMATEID^.
*Rhombus triacanthus (Peck).
(" Butter Fish."
"Butter Scup.")
These have never been known to take a hook.
All the specimens are taken in the pounds, as many as twenty barrels having been obtained in a day.
The first taken in 1904 was on May 6, and two the next day.
PERCID^.
Perca flavescens (MitchiU).
(" Pond Fish."
"Perch.")
Only taken in the fresh-water ponds, and very abundant.
SERRANID^.
Roccus lineatus (Bloch).
("Striped Bass.")
Rarely taken on the scup grounds.
Centropristes striatus (Linnaeus).
(" Black Bass.")
In October, 1903, about ten barrels were taken one day from the pounds.
Occasionally taken on the scup grounds.
SPARID^.
♦Stenotomus chrysops (Linnteus).
(" Scup " [abbreviation of Indian word Mishcuppauog].)
This is an important food fish, and until the introduction of the pounds was only taken by hand-lines.
They arrive in these waters about June 1.
The first fish are always the largest.
Later in the season smaller ones occur.
It is said that the first fishing-boat built with a well (in 1763) was first employed in the scup fishery.
In the summer of 1903 these fish practically abandoned these waters, a few were taken in the pounds, and the hand-lining was given up.
The first (two) were taken in the pound in 1904 on May 8.
SCI^NID^.
*Cynoscioii regalis (Schneider).
("Squi-dee.")
Common since the bluefish have become scarce.
Occasionally taken trolling, but never, as far as we know, have they been fished for with rods — so commonly practiced in the Jersey waters.
Large numbers taken in the pounds.
Menticirrhus saxatilis (Schneider).
(" Whiting.")
Taken with the mackerel in drift-nets in the spring and are given away, not being very highly esteemed as a food fish.
L ABRIDGE.
Tautogolabrus adspersus (Walbaum).
(" Wharf Fish.")
Fished by boys for cat food.
Common about the wharves.
Tautoga onitis (Linnaeus).
C'Tautog.")
Not common.
Taken on the scup grounds and hi the pounds.

Taken on the scup grounds.
The three secured were taken in the pound in 1903.
TETRAODONTID^.
Spheroides maculatus (Schneider).
("Swell-belly.")
Taken on the scup grounds.
MOLID^.
Mola mola (Linnaeus).
("Sun Fish.")
Rare.
Seen in deep water on calm days about the island.
One taken some years ago was sent by Dr. Harold Williams to Tuffts College, Massachusetts.
COTTID.iE.

One seen in pound, May 7, 1904.
C YCLOPTERID.i^ .
Cyclopterus lumpus Linnaeus.
("Lump Fish.")
One specimen (8 inches long) taken in the pound, May 8, 1904.
TRIGLIDiE.
♦Prionotus carolinus (Linnseus).
(" Peter Grunter.")
Common on scup grounds.
At times as many as two or three barrels taken in the pound.
Not used as food.
The senior writer has often eaten them, and finds them excellent.
Seen on May 6, 1904.
ECHENEIDID^.
Echeneis naucrates Linnaeus.
(" Sucker.")
Rare.
MERLUCCIID^.
Merluccius bilinearis (Mitchill).
("Hake.")

Taken in the trap October, 1903.
In the spring of 1902 the young, about 4 inches in length, were very abundant about the wharves.
GADID^.
FolacMus virens (Linnaeus).
("Pollock.")
Caught trolling off east coast.
Since the introduction of the pound they have been taken in great numbers.
From April 9 to May 5, 1904, very nearly 20,000 were taken by the Petrel.
Gadus callarias Linnaeus.
(" Cod.")
Taken in the spring and fall by hand-lmes and line-trawls on the shoals about the island and occasionally in the Sound at Long Hill.
Most of those taken by the Petrel Company are sent away, fresh, in ice, some are pickled and others salted and dried.
These fish for the last two years have greatly diminished in number.
Melanogrammus aeglefinus (Linnaeus).
("Haddock.")
Mostly taken in the spring of the year.
PLEURONEOTIDiE.
Hippoglossus hippoglossus (Linnaeus).
("Halibut.")
Many years ago regularly fished for off Great Point.
In April, 1904, Mr, Burehell, while cod-fishing off the east end of the island, caught a halibut on a codfish hook, but lost him.
He estimated the fish, which he saw, as weighing about 100 pounds.
Paralichthys dentatus (Linnaeus).
("Plaice.")
Very common on the bar in the summer of 1903.
Paralichthys oblongus (Mitchill).
(" Flounder.")
Two or three taken in the pound early in May, 1904.

513 NOTES ON ORTHOPTERA FROM NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MEXICO.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN.
The following study is based entirely on material in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
The States of Chihuahua, Jalisco, San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas arc represented in the^ series of about four hundred specimens studied.
The most extensive series is that, comprising two hundred and sixty-four specimens, collected in Jalisco, chiefly at Guadalajara, in 1903, by Mr. J. F. McClendon, and purchased by the Academy.
An exceedingly interesting collection of seventy-one specimens from San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas was collected by Mr. M. E. Hoag, and this limited series has furnished a surprising number of new and little known forms.
Three smaller collections are embraced in this study; a number of Guadalajara specimens collected and presented by Mr. C. H. T. Townsend; a few interesting individuals from Victoria, Tamaulipas, collected by S. N. Rhoads, and a series of Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, specimens, collected and presented by Dr. W. E. Hughes.

This species exhibits a great amount of color and coasiderable structural variation.
The single individual from Tuxpan is almost solid black in color, but no doubt represents this species, as extreme Guadalajara specimens have the pronotum and head, aside from the yellow lines and borders which are faintly marked in the Tuxpan individual, solid black.
The City of Mexico specimen is much more robust than any of the others examined, and may possibly prove to be a distinct species.
This form can readily be distinguished from picticornis (Walker) by the orange instead of crimson antennae.
This character may be subject to variation, as most the other color characters of the species are, but nevertheless it holds true in the above series, and in eight specimens of picticornis.
Good structural characters exist, however, to separate the two forms.

One of the male specimens was kindly compared by Mr. A. N. Caudell with typical specimens from San Luis Potosi, and he states that they are probably identical, though some slight differences do exist.
The drawing of the genitalia given by Scudder is misleading, as one receives the impression that the subgenital plate is longer in the Victoria males, while Mr. Caudell, after comparison with a co-type, states that the reverse is true.

NEW JAPANESE MARINE MOLLUSCA: PELECYPODA.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY.
The Pelecypods described herein were nearly all received from Mr. Y. Hh-ase, of Kyoto, Japan.
Most of them are from Hirado, Hizen, at the extreme west of Kyushu, where the wide-ranging species of the central Indo-Pacific province rule, and the exclusively Japanese faunal element is less conspicuous than farther north and east.
That many new forms are encountered even here but confirms the experience of other recent workers, that in all parts of the Indo-Pacific area there has been great local differentiation.
In these Proceedings, p. 6, I described a Conus from Ivikai-ga-shima as C. dormitor.
My attention has been called by several friends to the prior use of this name for an Eocene species; and I would therefore call the Japanese form Conus comatosa.
It is probably ancestral to the recent C. sieholdi Rve.

Shell shortly ovate, ventricose, rather thin, the beaks at about the anterior third of its length.
Pale buff, marked with three indistinct diverging brown rays, the color confined chiefly to the lamellae, and with some scattered spots, and narrow oblique stripes on each side of the beaks.
The beaks are rather full; the lunule cordate and defined by sunken lines; no escutcheon is defined on the right valve, but a depression marks it in the left.
The immersed ligament is narrowly lanceolate.
The anterior end is rounded, the posterior subtruncate.
Sculpture of very numerous rounded radial riblets, wider than their intervals, and undivided throughout.
These are crossed by many thin erect concentric lamellse.
The upper side of each one is fluted, the ridges corresponding to intervals of the radial riblets, while the lower side is much more deeply fluted, a narrow buttress arising from each radial riblet.
The interior is white, the pallial sinus short and ascending, rounded at the end.
Muscle impressions and pahial line are very faintly indicated.
The anterior and median cardinal teeth are simple and rather slender in the right valve, the posterior tooth deeply bifid.
In the left valve the anterior cardinal is simple compressed and high, the middle one wide and deeply bifid, the posterior slender and lamellar.
A curved ridge extends from the hinge-plate partly around the anterior 1 Conch.

This is a less ponderous species than either Cylherea puerpera or C. reticulata, the radial riblets are more numerous and the concentric lamellse thinner and higher than in either, and quite different in sculpture.
The hinge and teeth, while of the same type, are decidedly more delicate.
I rank the form as a variety of Venus crispata Desh.
(P. Z. S., 1853, p. 2, No.

Ligament immersed, short and lanceolate.
Sculpture of radial, rounded ribs, 18-20 in number, of wdiich three are on the lunule.
The ribs are wider near the anterior end, where several of them are flattened and divided by a median groove, and in the intervals of these bifid ribs a minute riblet is interposed near the lower margin.
Elsewhere the intervals are about as wide as the ribs.
The concentric riblets are low in the intervals, but on the ribs they rise as erect flat scales.
The interior is livid -whitish in the cavity, the muscleimpressions, pallial sinus and space below the pallial line being purplebrown, fading to white at the edge.
The pallial sinus is short and ascending, round at the end.
Both ends and the ventral margin are minutely crenulate within, and the margin within the lunule has very fine crenulations nearly parallel to the long axis of the shell.
In the left valve the anterior and posterior cardinal teeth are simple, the median one bifid, the posterior tooth being very thin.
The right valve has a bifid median cardinal, simple ones on each side, the anterior tooth very thin.

Shell small, shortly ovate, compressed, yellowish, irregularly maculate with reddish-brown.
Beaks slightly in front of the middle, small and projecting but slightly.
Anterior end broadly rounded, posterior end narrower and somewhat tapering.
Sculpture of about 42 rounded radial riblets, a little wider than their intervals, becoming very small at the two ends of the series, though they are largest at the anterior end of the shell.
The ribs of the anterior half of the shell are divided by a narrow median groove, on the lower half of each rib.
These radial riblets are crossed by many regular narrow concentric ridges, higher on the ribs than in the intervals; the whole producing the effect of a tiled roof.
The interior is white, usually with a drop-shaped purple-brown streak at one or both ends, and more or less extensive stains of similar tint in the cavity.
The pallial sinus is short and rounded.
The edge is crenulated in harmony with the riblets along the posterior half of the lower margin, but along the anterior half there are about two denticles to each rib.
The two ends are very finely crenulate, and the anterior side of the dorsal margin is crenulate parallel to the longest axis of the shell, the posterior dorsal margin being smooth.
The two obliquely triangular cardinal teeth in the right valve and the short median tooth in the right valve are slightly bifid.

There is a slight radial ridge posteriorly, the surface of the valves being elsewhere regularly convex.
Interior white and glossy, very faintly showing a very deep and wide pallial sinus, extending beyond the middle of the shell, and partly confluent with the pallial line below.
In the right valve there are two delicate diverging cardinal teeth, the ends overhanging the cavity, and strong, triangularly elevated lateral teeth.
The left valve has two cardinal teeth, the anterior one vertical, slightly bifid, the posterior tooth very thin, and parallel to the posterior dorsal slope.

This is a small, thin, nearly equilateral white species, with the apex of each valve red-brown, a vertical streak of the same color on the convexity of the valve below it, and sometimes some faint stains of the same at the sides.
The white interior shows the median streak, with usually side streaks and often some mottling or a streak along the pallial line.
The sculpture consists of about 9 rather strong but low rounded ribs on the posterior slope, divided into two sets by a shallow, wide radial valley, the last rib dorsally having a linear riblet on each side of it.
The median portion of the valve is almost smooth, showing the faintest traces of fine riblets near the lower margin ; but where the lower passes into the anterior slope the ribs are decidedly stronger, and denticulate the edge.
There is a minute punctulation at both ends in perfectly fresh shells.
The right valve has anterior and posterior lateral teeth, the anterior wanting in the other valve.

Shell subcircular and inflated, almost perfecth^ equilateral, thin white, profusely marked with pale flesh-pink zigzag streaks, the beaks fleshy-brown.
Sculpture of fine radial riblets at the ends, each scored at the summit with a finely punctured groove, the grooves persisting over the median portion of the shell where the riblets are obsolete or nearly so.
Anteriorly there are about 16 very regular riblets not extending to the edge above, a lanceolate lunular area being left smooth.
Posteriorly the riblets are coarser, less regular, part of them flattened and sulcate down the middle.
The riblets scarcely crenulate the margins of the valves.
The smoothish median part of the shell is regularly marked with close punctured lines, the spaces between them being perceptibly concave.
The interior is slightly fluted by the external ribs at the two ends, nearly smooth elsewhere.
The zigzag external markings show rose or crimson on a white ground, which deeper in the cavity changes to fleshy-brown.
The right valve has two contiguous cardinal teeth, the anterior one standing almost above the posterior, and well developed anterior and posterior lateral teeth.
In the left valve the cardinals diverge, the anterior being the larger.

This beautiful Cardium is related to C. papyracetim Brug., which I have not yet seen from Japan.
It is more fragile and more delicately sculptured than that species, in which the inner margins of the valves are closely and deeply fluted.
jMoreover, the altitude of C. 'papyraceum decidedly exceeds the length, while in C. annce the length is greater.
In C. papyraceum the posterior end is more produced than the anterior, the latter being noticeably straightened and subvertical, while in C. amice the two ends are almost equally rounded.
The coloration also differs.
There is a specimen of this species in the collection of the Academy, received many years ago from Andrew Garrett, labelled "C. tcheliense Debeaux, China."
Debeaux collected in Chinese waters and published a little-known and not very valuable paper on his results in Recueil de Memoires de Medicine, de Chirurgie et de Pharmacie militaires, redege sous le surveillance du Conseil de Sante, 3 ser., VI, Paris, 1861 ; but no mention is made therein of a Cardium tchcliense.
I have been unable to trace it in the literature examined.
The name suggests that of a province of northern China, but being orthographically defective, I have thought its retention undesirable.

I take these shells to belong to the species described by Kobelt in his excellent monograph cited above, and referred by him with great doubt, and on the authority of Mr. E. A. Smith, to A. ocellata Reeve, described from Singapore.
Having before me topotypes of A. ocellata, as well as several Japanese specimens which agree with them, I am compelled to regard the two species as entirely distinct, and not even closely related, although they agree in general shape.
The ligamentarea in A. ocellata is smooth, scored by only a few, usualh' imperfect ligament grooves, there being a large oblique triangle posteriorly and an erect triangle between the beaks free from them.
The two oblique triangles marked by grooves are usually covered with a smooth yellow (or in some Japanese shells, blackish) cuticle, while the rest of the area is whitish.

561 36 NOTES ON ORTHOPTERA FROM ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO AND COLORADO.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN.
The specimens mentioned in the following pages are almost all contained in the collection of the Academy, and chiefly represent collections made in the summer of 1902 in central Arizona, northern New Mexico and central Colorado by C. F. Oslar, and in the summer of 1903 by C. R. Biederman, at Florence, Pinal county, Arizona.
A few specimens from Yuma county, Arizona, belonging to the Hebard Collection, have also been studied in this connection.

This specimen probably belongs to this genus and species, but several characters, such as the proportions of the prozona and metazona, do not agree with the description.
These parts are said to be "of subequal length," while in the specimen at hand the metazona is decidedly shorter than the prozona.
Generally, however, the specimen agrees very well with the description.
Gomphocerus clepsydra Scudder.

Cockerell.)
One male, two females.
I am not prepared to make any critical remarks on the standing of the several American "species" of this genus, and accordingly the use of clepsydra as a full species should not be considered an expression of opinion, but simply the utilization of a term to designate a type the validity of which is, to say the least, doubtful.

One female, I cannot agree with CaudelP in uniting A. teporaia with this species.
They appear to me quite distinct, and separable by the length of the tegmina and wings in the female, and in the form of the vertex.
In this connection I have examined thirty-seven specimens of the two species.

( ? )
Allied to A. nietana Saussure, but differing in the slenderer form, the narrower vertex, the more vertical face, the longer metazona and the slenderer posterior femora.
(^.
— Size medium; form somewhat slender.
Head with the occiput bearing several longitudinal rug£e, the median one extending forward to the tip of the scutellum of the vertex; scutellum p\Tiform, longer than broad, very slightly excavated, margins moderately high, the median carina broken centrally; lateral foveolae elongate, subtrigonal, not strongly marked; frontal costa broad and subequal inferiorly, at the ocellus expanded and slightly and shallowly excavated, above the ocellus distinctly constricted, subequal, apex truncate, this portion w^ith a distinct median carina; eye not prominent and about equal in length to the infraocular portion of the genae; antenna a1)out equal to the head and pronotum in length.
Pronotum with the median carina rather low, even, distinctly cut by the last sulcus; anterior margin very obtuse-angulate ; posterior margin acute-angulate with the angle rounded ; surface of the disk rugoso-granulate ; lateral lobes of the pronotum subequal, deeper than wide.
Interval between the metasternal lobes slightly longer than broad.
Tegmina moderately long; apex obliquely truncate; greatest width about median.
Wings not elongate, two-thirds as wide as long.
Posterior femora robust, reaching to the apex of the abdomen, superior and inferior margins equally arcuate.
9.
— Similar to the male with the following important exceptions: Scutellum of the A-ertex broad, about as broad as long; frontal costa 1 Proc.
U. S. Nat.
Mus., XXVI, p. 785. distinctly silicate below the ocellus; antennse somewhat shorter than the head and pronotum.
Median carina of the pronotum lower than in the male; posterior margin of the pronotmii rectangulate with the apex rounded.
Intervals between the metastcrnal lobes verj^ slightlybroader than long.
General color blackish-brown, sprinkled with small obscure blackish maculations.
Abdomen and under surface dull yellowish in the male, varying from yelloT\ish-brown to dark wood-brown in the females, and the paler specimens of the latter sex have the abdomen with regular lateral blotches of brownish-black.
Tegmina of the general color.
Wings with the disk flame-scarlet, the fuscous bar rather dark but fading on the posterior margin of the wing ; apex suffused with fuscous ; taenia rather broad, solid, but not reaching the base of the wing; costal margin of the color of the disk.
Posterior femora externally with traces of several transverse dark bars, the apical one of which is fairly apparent and somewhat contrasts a weak pregenicular annulus of ochraceous; genicular region blackish; internal face with the pregenicular annulus yellowish and distinct, the remainder black with the superior and inferior margins cut by two broken bars of yellowish.
Posterior tibise greenish-yellow {o") or dull brown, dark apically; spines tipped with black.

The most striking variation exliibited by the series is in color, size being quite constant.
The ground color in some individuals is almost uniform, in others strongly maculate, while several have the posterior margin and the entire lateral lobes of the pronotum conspicuously barred with the two primary shades.
In several specimens the axillary field of the tegmina is straw-colored, while a great amount of variation is exhibited in the intensity of the external bars of the posterior femora.
The color of the disk of the wings appears to be constant.

ON A COLLECTION OF BIRDS AND MAMMALS FROM MOUNT SANHEDRIN,1I CALIFORNIA, BY WITMER STONE.
(With Field Notes by A. S.
Bunnell.)
The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has recently secured a valuable collection of Calif ornian birds and mammals, formerly the property of Mr. A. S. Bunnell, of Berkeley.
Mr. Bunnell collected most of his specimens in the neighborhood of Berkeley and about Mount Tallac in the Sierras, both of which localities have received consideralDle study of late years, especially with regard to their avifauna.
The most interesting portion of the collection, however, comes from Mount Sanhedrin, in ^lendocino county, and as practically nothing has been published upon the fauna of this region, it seems desirable to present the results of Mr. Bunnell's work.
In reply to my request for information as to the nature of the country, he has very kindly furnished me with the following account, which I quote in full.
"I was located at Lierlie's ranch, 2,100 feet elevation, which is a cluster of cottages on the north side of a range of spruce-covered hills that rise from Thomas creek, a tributary of Eel river.
On the opposite side of this creek from the ranch rises Mount Sanhedrin, which attains an elevation of about 5,000 feet.
The whole country is covered with Douglass Spruce and Bull Pine forests on the north sides of the hills, with a few cedars in the shady parts.
In more level places there are madronos and black oaks, and on exposed sunny slopes either manzanita and other brush or else grassy clearings.
Where the forests are not deep there is much underbrush, and along Thomas creek are alders and willows.
The creek is a wild trout stream about twenty feet in width, tumbling throughout its length, while Eel river is about thirty yards wide.
There is an abundance of water, although the region lies east of the humid coast belt, and there are no redwoods to be found.
''The ranch is in the transition zone, apparently nearly on the boundary, as one can hear at the same time the songs of the Russet-back and Dwarf Hermit Thrushes and the calls of the Valley Quail and Plumed Partridge.
Mount Sanhedrin runs up into the Hudsonian, and on its top, where the snow disappears in May, are found the Thick-biUed Sparrow, Golden-crowned Kinglet and ■Mountain Chickadee.
The top of the mountain is mostly covered with low snow-crushed spiny brush, while White-barked Firs grow on the north side."
The specimens were collected on two trips made in 1897 and 1899, during the months of May, June and July.
MAMMALS.
Twenty-one species of mammals were secured by Mr. Bunnell, and eleven others are reported by him as occurring in the vicinity.
For the identification of the bats I am indebted to Mr. J.
A. G. Rehn, while Mr. W. H. Osgood has kindly examined several of the other species and compared them with specimens in the collection of the U. S. Biological Survey.
Species reported by Mr. Bunnell but not represented in the series are marked with an asterisk.
Citellus graminiirus douglasii (Richardson).
Columbian Spermophile.
Two males.
June 11 and July 14.
Central shoulder patch jet black, and sides very bright silvery gray.
Eutamias hindsi (Gray).
Hinds' Chipmunk.
A male and female, May 30 and June 28, are in the dull pelage, but another pair secured July 8 have patches of bright rusty hairs cropping out on the back and sides.
Sciurus douglasii albolimbatus Allen.
Sierran Chickaree.
One female example, June 30, which seems absolutely identical with central Sierra specimens and shows no tendency toward moUipilosus of the redwood belt.
Sciurus griseus Ord.
Oregon Gray Squirrel.
Six specimens, June 1 to July 24.
Reithrodontomys longicauda (Baird).
One specimen, a female, June 11.
^leasurements as follows: Length 115 mm., tail 37 (partly lost), hind foot 19, ear 15.
Apparently identical with Berkeley specimens.
Peromyscus gambelii (Baird).
White-footed Mouse.
Represented by a full series of specimens.
Peromyscus truei (Shufeldt).
Big-eared Mouse.
Four adults in tawny pelage, May 29 to June 14; two probably younger, June 13 and 14, much less tawny, and five young, May 29June 14, in mouse gray pelage, some of them with buff patches on the sides, showing the molt into the preceding stage.
I was at first inclined to think that some of these were P. boylii, but comparison with specimens of the latter, kindly loaned by Mr. D. G. 37 Elliot from the collection of the Field Columbian Museum, convinces me that they all belong to the present species.
Neotoma fuscipes Baird.
Round-tailed Wood Rat.
Two adults and two young, June 13-15.
These seem identical with Berkeley specimens, and it is noticeable that one from each locality has a partly bicolor tail.
In this and other respects this rat seems subject to much individual variation, and I cannot but think that some of the recently established forms which do not seem to have any distinctive geographic range will prove to have been based upon unstable characters.
Microtus californicus (Peale).
California Vole.
One specimen, identical with those from Berkeley.
Phenacomys longicaudus True.
One female example of this rare mouse was found dead in a road, June 30.
1899 (No.
11,625, Coll.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila.).
The occurrence of this species so far south of its previously known habitat in C)regon is of particular interest, apart from the fact that this is, so far as I am aware, only the third specimen that has been secured.^ In color this specimen is pale rusty, with an admixture of grayishwhite hairs, especially about the head and shoulders, and with long rather inconspicuous black hairs scattered over the whole upper surface, beneath grayish-white with the plumbeous bases of the hairs showing through, feet pale rusty above, grayish-white below, tail dark brown with a mixture of silvery white hairs below which make it appear indistinctly bicolor.
Length 170 mm., tail 70, hind foot 19.
The skull resembles that of P. preblei (the only one available for comparison) in general appearance, but is relatively narrower.
Basilar length 20 mm., zygomatic breadth 14, occipito-nasal length 24, length of nasals 7.
The teeth have been described in detail by Mr. Miller.
Those of the present specimen are considerably worn.
Thomomys bottae (Eydoux and Gervais).
California Gopher.
Three specimens.
Lepus badnnani W^aterhouse.
Bachman's Rabbit.
Two specimens, a female and young male, July 6 and June 14.

BIRDS.
The collection of birds contains representatives of fifty-six species, all of which, from the time of capture, may be regarded as breeding.
To these Mr. Bunnell has added thirty-three species observed, but not secured.
These are marked with an asterisk.
The collection has been carefully identified with reference to subspecific differences, as the locality is to some extent on the borderland of the humid coast, the Sierran and the Upper Sonoran faunas.
The field notes are entirely from Mr. Bunnell's journal.

BY WITMER STOXE.
The following list of mammals, obtained by Mr. A. S. Bunnell in the neighborhood of Berkeley and in the Sierras, and now forming part of the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, is published as a contribution toward our knowledge of the distribution of the various species and subspecies.
The bats have been studied and identified by Mr. J.
A. G. Rehn.
Berkeley Collectiox.
Citellus grammurus beecheyi (Rich.).
A series from Berkeley.
Neotoma fuscipes Baird.
A number of specimens from Berkeley; two have partly bicolor tails and the color of the adults varies considerably, some being much redder than others.
In view of this individual variation it would seem that the N. fuscipes affinis of Elliot and probably some of the other races recently proposed will, with .V.
monochroura of Rhoads, be eventually relegated to synonymy.
Peromyscus gambelii (Baird).
A series from Berkeley.
Peromyscus californicus (.Gambel).
A number from Berkeley.
Through the kindness of Mr. D. G. Elliot I have received from the Field Columbian ]\Iuseum topotypes of his P. dyselius and certain other specimens, including P. hoylii, for comparison with the above series.
The result is that I find in the Berkeley lot typical specimens of both P. californicus and dyselius and others that appear to be ecpially referal^le to either, and my conclusion is that the latter form is leased upon younger or smaller examples of californicus.
Rhoads' P. major is likewise a synonym of californicus, as shown conclusively by a comparison of the types in the Academy collection.
Mr. Bunnell got no specimens of P. hoylii at Berkeley — that is, none of the form so identified by ^Ir.

These specimens have the forearm considerably longer than in the Eastern cynocephalus , and differ appreciably in color, though the latter is rather uncertain as few skins of cynocephalvs are available for comparison.
A skin of cynocephalus appears decidedly brownish when compared with californicus; the upper parts are mummy brown against seal brown ^^-ith a grayish suffusion in californicus, the under parts are raw umber compared with sepia suffused with ashy gray in californicus.

General Characters.
— Similar to E. fiiscus osceola Rhoads in size and cranial characters, but differing in the darker upper surface, the grayer under parts and the blacker membranes.
From fuscus it may immediately be differentiated by the more reddish-brown upper surface and less silvery under parts.
Distribution.
— Specimens from the type locality only have been examined.
Size.
— In general proportions fuscus.
f. osccola and /.
meIa7iopterus seem almost identical.
The average of five specimens of each shows that /.
melanopterus has the forearm averaging almost three millimeters longer than in fuscus, Avhile osceola is considerably smaller than the former, and very slightly less than the latter.
Color.
— Above rather dark cinnamon, lightest on the top of the head and at the shoulders.
Under surface reddish wood brown.
Membranes and face deep blackish.
In true fuscus the upper surface is drab, below pale isabella color.
In fuscus osceola the upper parts are much the same tint as in melanopterus, but not as rich in tone, while the under parts are more of a yellowish-brown, and not as ashy in tint.
The membranes of fuscus osceola are much paler in coloration than in melanopterus.
Skull.
— Identical with the typical form.
Teeth.
— The last upper molar in melanopterus appears to be broader than in fuscus or /.
osceola.
Otherwise the dental series seem to be identical.
Remarks.
— The form from Mount Tallac is no doubt closest related to /.
osceola than any of the form of fuscus.
The original series of the former has been examined in this connection, and the differential characters were drawn from it.
The relationship with true fuscus is not so close as an examination of a series of thirty specimens from, or within a radius of, twenty miles of the type localit}^ shows.
No close relationship exists with E. f. hernarclinus Rhoads, which is a very pale type quite different from any of the forms here considered.
From /.
osceola the new form may be easily distinguished by the richer color of the upper parts and the more smoky under surface, as well as the more blackish membranes.

ON CERTAIN RHACHIGLOSSATE GASTROPODA ELIMINATED FROM THE AQTJILLID^.
BY H. A. PILSBRY AND E. G. YANATTA.
Among the smaller species described Iw the older authors as "Tritons," and referred by Tryon and others to the subgenus Epidromus, there exists some diversity in shell characters, and a much greater difference in the soft anatomy.
Morch many years ago eliminated his Muricid genus Aspella from this assemblage, and Kesteven, in an able and interesting paper, has recently shown an Australian species, Triton speciosus Angas, to belong to Trophon, figuring its operculum and teeth.
^ Another Muricid genus is represented by Triton bracteatus Hinds, and its allies, characteristic and widespread littoral Polynesian species.
This group may be called MACULOTRITON Dall.= The shell is acuminate-oblong, longitudinally plicate and spirally tuberculate-lirate, with a smooth trochoidal nucleus of about 3+ whorls.
Aperture ovate, the outer lip thick, dentate within, and strengthened by a rounded varix outside, another varix often developed opposite it on the last whorl.
Anterior canal open, very short.
A small posterior sinus is defined by a low callous on the parietal wall.
Operculum with basal nucleus.

=> In a paper issued last February, one of the'present authors suggested that Colubraria hchum., which had always been associated with the xlnioglossate Triton, might prove to be Rhachiglossate, and remarked that "a series of Antillean and Pacific species referred to this division bv Trvon and others of which decapitatus Reeve and bracteatus Hinds are typical, belongs to the Rhachiglossa, as Mr. Vanatta and the writer will elsewhere show."
In a paper on the Tritons and Frog-shells just issued.
Prof. W. H. Ball adopts but does not define a fanuly Colubrariidce to include Colubraria, the groups we had indicated as Rhachiglossate and one or two others.
He anticipates the appearance of the data promised by us, by giving names to the groups we had indicated as Rhachiglossate.
It remains, therefore, for us to substitute in our proof-sheets the names given by Dall for those we had written, and to e.xpose the true characters and family relationships of the gastropods in question As to the "Family Colubrariida'," the typical genus Colubraria is as yet known by the shell alone.
The other groups referred to it by Dall, of which the dentition is known belong without any doubt to the Aluricidce and Buccinidce.
Is science advanced by the formation of family groups upon such grounds?

The shell in this genus has much the appearance of the Buccinoid Tritonidea.

VAKIABILITY AND AUTOTOMY OF PHATARIA.
BY SARAH P. MONKS.
Phataria (Linckia) unifascialis Gray, var.
hifascialis is a starfish that is remarkable for the variabihty in the size and number of its rays.
Regularity is the exception.
In over 400 specimens examined not more than four were symmetrical and no two were alike.
Fig.
13, PI.
XLII, is a nearly symmetrical six-raj^ed star, but one of its rays has been broken off and renewed.
The plate shows the great variability in size of stars, number of rays and different breaking places.
The animals vary in size from four to seventeen centimeters.
This difference may in some measure be due to age.
but there is evidently also considerable difference in size in adult specimens.
The normal number of rays is five, but some specimens have onl\^ one, while others have four, six, seven, or even nine; four, five or six being most common numbers.
Of 248 specimens examined 29 had one ray, 34 four rays, 135 five rays, 44 six rays, 5 seven rays and 1 nine raj^s.
There is a marked irregularity in the size of the rays, for the breaking and renewing occur at all ages, or, at least, at all sizes.
Single living rays without any externa!
sign of disk are not micuinnion.
Twenty-two in a lot of 240 were single.
In animals measured the rays varied in length fi'om 22 75 mm., and wei-e in all conditions, from specimens which sht)wed by tlie raw siu'face tiiat the l^reakage was recent, through all grades of healing surfaces to stars where new rays appeared as mere buds, to the comet series and to the \'arious rays of adnlt Phataria'.
Comets are fiv(iuently found; tlicic were foi'ty-oneof tiiein in 240 specimens.
These are stars with one long I'uy and a nuniln'r of small rays extending from a minute disk.
'J'iiey aw rays that ha\'e made a new body.
In PI.
XITI, 3-11 are.
comets.
The long ray is from 2-7 cent, in length.
( )n account of their small size the single rays and comets are more easily overlooked by collectors.
This species of Phataria is mottled reddish-brown and ash color, with the tips of the I'ays and the small new raj's, or new })ortioii of the ray, a brighter and uniform red.
It is easy to distinguish new parts by this growth "color," even when the line of breakage is obliterated.
From the great discrepancy in the size of the rays it follows that one or two rays may be sexually mature, while others are small or even buds.
In two indi\aduals sexually mature August 4, 1901, the measurements of rays show: &, 77.70.58.20 mm.
; 9 , 70.65.52.13 mm.
This species generally has two or more madreporites and two or more ani.
There is a great difference in the size of the madreporic body and frequently, but not always, it is larger in large specimens.
In 174 specimens 6 had one, 154 had.
two, 11 had three, 2 had four and 1 had five madreporites.
The ani are only visible in live animals.
In 6S specimens 15 had one, 48 had two, 3 had three, 1 had four ani.
There may be some connection, as has been suggested, between madreporites and breaking plane, but I have failed to find anything satisfactory on the subject.
Sometimes the largest ray, or a large ray, is between two madreporic bodies.
In 132 specimens 87 long arms and 45 short arms were between the madreporites.
There is a further irregularity in this species in the place from whicli the reproductive material finds exit.
Usually in asteroids it comes from tlie angle between rays, but in Phataria the sperm and ova may come from any part of the inner two-thirds of a ray.
1 have also found this year (August, 1904) that a Phataria may have two mouths.
In fig.
22 there is a mouth at each meeting point (A and B) of the ambulacral furrows.
In No.
11 there are also indications of two mouths, and in another specimen I have, but owing to the rareness of the peculiarity I have not wished as yet to d(^stroy these two sijecimens in order to prove the surmise.
The want of symmetry in tliis Pliataria suggests the belief that the al)ility to bf(nik and regenerate is greater in this species than in ordinary Asteroidea, and that it is a common factor in the life of the species.
Most starfish can lose their rays and make new ones, but it is a generally accepted opinion among zoologists tliat :i. ray cannot make a newbody unless some portion of the disk is present, in 1\ hi.fascialis (_!r.
there is a suggestion that a ray can regenerate a Ixidy, althougli the evidence is inconclusive.
The suggestion is seen in the series of figs.
1-11 in the plate.
^ ' Since writing the above in 1901 I have been fortunate in a series of experiments extending to the present time, August, 1904, in having a number of single rays, cut at various places, regenerate the disk and other rays.
I cut off rays, and in that way the stretching of the pyloric cteca and tlie consequent loss of 5-'<S rK(K;REi)iN(;s ok tiik acadkmv ok I--^"?
;"-, This suggestion springs from various facts: The extent of the ''growth color" in comets, the apparent absence of disk in single rays, and the constant place of breaking in the pyloric caeca.
The breaking place in the skeleton may occiunear the disk, IVom f)-12 nun.
fVom tlie angle of th(^ ray, or at almost any |)oint on the i-ay.
I have never seen a break tliat was decidedly inside the disk.
In 18 S]:)ecimens with '20 regenerating rays, 4 were less than 3 mm., 20 wci-c from .T-G mm., and 2 wci'e Hf) and 4") mm.
from angle.
The cause of breaking is obscure.
Tnlike Ophiurians th(\y are exceedingly tougli.
At touch Phatariti becomes hard, tough and rigid, and wlien it is thus contracted it.
requires considerable strength to pull it asunder, :ind it is ;i (ntiiriill mnlter ^^\■^']\ to cut among the ossicles.
If :iny cxleiiial force br.-irs n pnii in hrcnking the nnimal it is probable that the (-reature is surprised when lim)) and relaxed, but 1 am inclined to think that Phdlarid always breaks itself, no matter what may b(^ the im])ulse.
They may break wlien conditions are changed, somcd-imes within a few hours after being placed in jars, or a few days, or even not for months.
Some never In-eak, but stand all kinds of inconvenience of heat and cold and stagnant water.
Ther(^ is no season for the breaking, for they are found newly broken in the sea in all seasons of the year.
The sensitiveness of this species to our cold spells in winter and hot spells in sununer has put an end to many promising experiments.
Whatever may be the stimulus the aninud can and does break of itself.
Dm'ing the years 1901-04 1 have watche<l more tlian fifty stai'Iish disunite.
There is a regulai'ity about the matter that indicates that the breaking is not an accident, or the fancy of a day, l)ut a habit of the species.
The breaking is automatic.
Exjjeriment confirms the inference that naturally arises on seeing a large number of specimens together that the irregularity is due to an inherent character of this species of Phatarin.
The process is deliberate.
It is not a breaking in the proper sense of the word, but a drawing or pulling asunder.
It requires from half an hour to three or four hours, with resting spells, and the motions arc perceptible.
The ordinary method is for the main portion of the starfish to remain fixed and passive with the tube feet set on the side opposite the departing ray, and for this ray to walk slowdy away at right angles to time for its withdrawal were avoided and after a number of months the ray liad reached the comet stage.

1904. the body, to change position, twist, and do all the active labor necessaiy to the breakage.
If there are more rays than are needed to resist the pulling arm they take a negative part and position.
Frequently they hang limp with their ambiilacrae withdrawn.
There seems to be the same coordination in this work as in the walking of Asteroidea, for in the six or eight positions taken during the severing of a ray the larger portion of the star always keeps pulling in a direction opposite that of the parting ra}", and not in any, or all, of the fom-, five or six directions of radiation.
The skeleton breaks in one of two ways.
In one way the ray swells about its midpoint and grows smaller at its proximal portion as it pulls away from the body.
In the region of strain the ossicles become separated for a space of about 25 mm., so that the white connective and muscular tissues shine between them till finally, just before parting, they stand out like beads on a network of shiny white floss.
There is much more elasticity in the animal at this time than would seem possible in a starfish.
Immediately after the break the ossicles recover their compact position and the two parted edges show a more or less jagged surface.
This way is rapid, the body wall being pulled apart in from three to thirty minutes after the arm becomes narrowed.
In the other way of breaking onh^ a small area is affected l)y the strain, and the breaking place shows from the first as a fracture.
There is no narrowing of the ray, no strained surface and no gradual separation of ossicles.
A small opening, something like a crack, appears on the dorsal side of the ray, and this increases with an uneven edge till tlie l)ody wall is parted around the entire ray.
The first visible evidence of this kind of division is, either the ray is in a strained ])osition opposite the body or it lo{)s over and hangs limp, letting its weight act as the pulling power.
The invarial)le methofl in Phataria I }ui\-e watched, after the body wall l)reaks, is: The arm walks away; the pyloric ca;ca are pulled out of tlie arm, sometimes for 80 mm., and kept v(My tense; then a break occurs in llic tube connecting Hi'' |)\ loiic Cffica with the stomach ; \]w pyloric c;ecaur(> wilhdvawn into the at tu luid the small portion of the liilx* into the l)0(ly and the arm is ivw.
The ))arting of the soft tissues is not abrupt, is acconiplislied by simdering strands thread by thread.
The pyloric ca-ca and tube are wonderfully elastic.
Sometimes the tube is stretched till it appears as the finest thread.
After breaking the pyloric caeca coil up, and as they are retracted to thoir ordinary ])')sili(in an occasional s|)asiii(>(lic jerk is seen in Ihcni.
Sometimes tliey are withdrawn immediately, Ijut frequently an arm crawls around for hours, or days, trailing tire cipcuui till it is withdrawn or falls away.
Probably if the caeca are not taken in within a few hoiu's the nuiscles ose their elasticity and the caeca decay and drop off.
Occasionally these organs are left on the disk and sometimes the tube is broken in such a manner as to leave them hanging like two coiled trails.
After freeing itself the ray crawls up the glass and stations itself with the broken i)art downward and remains so for a long time.
This is the attitude of a single ray till all, or nearly all, the pyloric caecum assumes its noi"mal position.
After one arm is s(>)jarated, or even wlien it is going, another may break away.
1 saw one animal try to break tlK> disk apart after having lost two rays.
It took many positions, strainc^d the (issues and worked for hours, j)ut died before the disk was broken.
Tlic results of my observations are: The breaking is automatic; and is effected by pulling apart or fracture without strain; there is cijordination of parts in producung the separation; the tissues relax at the plane of rupture; this ])lane may be near the disk or a variable distances from it on the ray; the ])yloric cieca arc always pulled out and nuich stretched; the break of the caecum occurs at the tube connecting ihv.
stoma(!h and glandular portion; the ])yloric (;iecum is gc^ierally taken ])m'k into the arm; the severed ray may live more than a week, even mider adverse circumstances, without signs of regeneration; and, from my experiments extending over a ])eriod of three years, 1 have; found that rays cut various distances from the disk make disks, moutlis and new rays in about six montlis.
