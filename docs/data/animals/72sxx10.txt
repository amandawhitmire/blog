329 A COLOMBIAN PUPILLID SNAIL.
BY HENRY A, PJLSBRY.
Among other interesting mollusks collected by Messrs. Morgan Hebard and J.
A. G. Rehn during their recent visit to Colombia, there were specimens of a peculiar snail of the family Pupillidse, which may be described as follows.
Gastrocopta colombiana n. sp.
Figs.
1-4.
The shell is thin, faintly brown tinted, subcylindric, but tapering very slowly from the last whorl, composed of 53^2 strongly convex whorls, the last whorl somewhat flattened dorsally, with a slight impression over the inner part of the lower palatal fold.
Faintly striate.
The aperture is squarish-oval; peristome thin, well expanded and reflected, continuous across the parietal wall, but very shortly adnate there.
The angulo-parietal lamella reversed yFigs.

— Columella and parietal wall seen from below, the peristome above, showing: c, columellar lamella; p, parietal, and a, angular lamellae.

— Inside of the palatal wall, the peristome on the right, s, suprapalatal fold; u, upper palatal; I, lower palatal, and b. basal folds.
shaped, the angular sinuous, emerging to the lip edge, parietal arcuate, higher, emerging much less.
Columellar lamella strong, lunate, the inner half descending, outer horizontal.
Within the outer lip there is a small, high, suprapalatal fold and a larger, more immersed upper palatal.
Lower palatal fold is very long, somewhat immersed, oblique and indistinctly binodose in front, its upper end continued inward as a slender ridge, then enlarging into a high, stout fold.
The basal fold is transverse, weakly bilobed.
Length 2, diameter 9 mm.

Type and paratypes no.
46634 A. N. S. P. While this species of the subgenus Immersidens is somewhat similar to G. cochisensis, G. daUiana and other North American snails of the same subgenus, it differs remarkably in the palatal folds, the upper being doubled, probably by division of a primitively single upper palatal, and the lower fold enters so deeply that its full structure can be understood only by breaking out the palatal wall, as in fig.
4.
A weak-toothed form of Gastrocopfa senilis (Gld.,) referable to G. s. riisei (Pfr.
), was found in the same locality.
