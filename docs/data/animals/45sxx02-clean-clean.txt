DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF NEOTOMA FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
By Witmer Stone.
I have recently obtained through the kindness of Mr. J. G. Dillin two specimens of a wood rat which were secured near the top of South Mountain 2000 ft. Cumberland County Penna. some six miles from Pine Grove at a point known as Lewis's Cave which constitute the first record of the occurrence of the genus Neotoma in this State.
The first specimen of this rat secured by Mr. Dillin was a male and was taken in a trap set for raccoons.
It was at once recognized as diffei'ent from the common brown rat and was preserved with a view to having its identity settled but was afterward unfortunately lost.
The next day Dec. 2 1892 a female specimen was secured and was brought to me in the flesh.
At my request Mr. Dillin wrote to friends who were hunting on South Mountain and secured one more specimen.
After comparing these two specimens with a series of Neotomas from the collection of the American Museum of Natural History kindly loaned me by Mr. F. M. Chapman and some specimens loaned by Dr. C. Hart Merriam of the U. S. Department of Agriculture I am convinced that they represent an undescribed species for which I propose the name of Neotoma pennsylvanica.
This species may be distinguished from N. floridana of the South Atlantic and Gulf States by its larger size its densely hairy and distinctly bicolored tail and by certain well marked cranial characters.
The specimens here described are both females and are perhaps not quite full sized though evidently adult.
The male specimen according to Mr. Dillin's account must have been at least twenty inches 508 mm.
long and had the tail more hairy than the two in my possession.
The detailed description follows  Neotoma pennsylvanica sp.
nov. Pennsylvania Wood Rat.
Type No.

J. G. Dillin.
General color similar to that of N. floridana plumbeous above with a number of black hairs interspersed and a yellowish brown undertone which is pure and bright on the sides of the head and body becoming almost a pinkish tint on the flanks.
Feet and lower surface pure white.
Tail densely hairy surpassing in this respect any specimens of either N. floridana or N. mexicana that I have seen.
The color of the tail is black above and pure white beneath the line of demarcation being very sharp  viewed from directly above the scales are completely hidden by the hairs.
The two females in my possession measure as follows  No.

The upper surface is more nearly horizontal i. e. not so much curved the frontal bones are much depressed along the frontal suture the outer edges next to the orbits forming decided ridges.
The pterygoid processes are larger and converge more than in N. floridana so that the mesopterygoid fossa is longer and narrower.
The upper margin of the infraorbital foramen as viewed from above is also much narrower in N. pennsylvanica.
The teeth are rather heavier than in N. floridana and the distance between the anterior molar and the incisor from the alveola
is relatively greater.
