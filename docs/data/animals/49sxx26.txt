SCAPHOPODA OF THE SAN DOMINGO TERTIARY.
BY H. A. PILSBRY AND BENJ.
SHARP, M. D. This account of the Scaphopods of the San Domingo tertiary strata variously denominated Miocene or Oligocene, is an outcome of investigations undertaken by the writers in the course of work upon a monograph of the Scaphopoda published in the " Manual of Conchology."
It is based upon collections made by "VV.
M. Gabb, and briefly described in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.
Owing probably to Gabb's illness when he prepared the palaeontological part of the " Geology of San Domingo," and to his death before its publication, the study of his material seems to have been incomplete.
Our examination of the material shows that of six species described or recorded by him from the beds in question, Dentalium rudis is the tube of a Serpuloid worm ; D. ponderosum is, as Guppy has already claimed, a form of D. dissimile of the Jamaican Oligocene ; D. affine bears a preoccupied name, and Gadus dominguensis is not that species, but a new one allied to the form called Ditrupa dentalina by Mr. Guppy.
Among the specimens of the species discriminated by Gabb, and in several trays of undetermined specimens, we have been able to distinguish ten new and well-characterized forms, besides several which are probably distinct species, but being represented by young or very fragmentary individuals have been ignored in the following account.
1 As to the age of the deposit in San Domingo furnishing these remains, and that of the same horizon at Bowden, Jamaica, there is diversity of opinion.
Gabb and some others have considered it Miocene; and in view of the considerable number of species still existing in the Gulf of Mexico, and the close relationship of many of the extinct forms with living species, this estimate is not without support.
Conrad, however, in 1852 2 and again in 1866 3 expressed 1 Among these, fragments of a species probably referable to our subgenus Episiplion may be mentioned.
This group is represented in the German Oligocene by Dentalium otloi Sharp & Pils.

200, p. 37. his belief that the San Domingo deposit was Oligocene.
This opinion has recently been re-affirmed by Dall 4 who considers the Bowden marls of Jamaica and the beds of similar age in Santo Domingo to be upper Oligocene.
In considering so small a fragment of the fauna as the Scaphopoda constitute, a full discussion of this question is uncalled for ; the more because the Scaphopods afford no conclusive data.

PI.

10, 11.
Shell a hexagonal prism with slightly convex faces, slender, slowly tapering, moderately solid, glossy.
Sculpture: there are 6 very narrow equidistant longitudinal threads, well raised and sharply defined, the wide intervals between them flat on the smaller end of the shell, but become decidedly convex toward the larger end ; circular sculpture of rather strongly impressed annular growth marks at unequal intervals, sometimes close, sometimes distant.
Aperture not preserved in the material before us, but apparently not oblique and with nearly circular peristome but slightly modified in shape by the longitudinal threads.
Apex not known, but evidently hexagonal.
Length of (broken) type specimen 23 mm.
; greatest diam.
at larger end 35, at smaller end 2'7 mm.
The type has lost from the smaller end a considerable portion of its original length and probably somewhat less from the oral extremity.
When perfect it probably measured not far from 45 or 50 mm.
The portion remaining is perfectly characteristic, and unlike any Tertiary or living species of this region in the filiform riblets running from end to end, with wide convex intervals showing no intermediate longitudinal sculpture, or only the faintest traces of riblets in places, visible only under the lens at a certain angle of reflection.
This is the form mentioned by Gabb under his remark on D. dissimile, in his paper "On the Topography and Geology of Santo Domingo," p. 244.
It is named in honor of Maurice Cossmann of Paris, whose fruitful labors upon the Parisian Eocene are justly esteemed by workers upon Tertiary mollusks.
Dentalium callioglyptum n. sp.
PL X, figs.

XT, fig.
21.
Shell large, solid and but very slightly curved ; noticeably compressed between the convex and concave surfaces; decidedly tapering.
Sculpture, many longitudinal cords or riblets alternating with threads, altogether numbering about 65 near aperture, about 40 near the middle of the length, the ridges averaging about the width of the grooves ; the whole crossed by circular raised lamella?
running a little obliquely around the tube ; these lamella?
very close, nearly regular, most conspicuous in the intervals, and so fine that they are scarcely visible to the unaided eye.
The circular lamella?
subobsolete toward the aperture in large specimens.
Aperture slightly oblique, judging by the lines of growth ; apex unknown ; but according to the fragments before us both orifices are slightly oval in consequence of the compression of the tube.
Length unknown, but from the taper of the fragments probably about 115 mm.
; greatest diam.
of larger end of largest fragment 13, least diam.
of same 12 mm., length 15 mm.
Another fragment from near the middle of the shell measures, length 30, greatest diam.
of larger end I'd, of smaller end 4 6 mm.
; therefore tapering to the extent of 3 3 mm.
in a length of 30 mm.
The specimens were collected by Gabb, who referred them with a " ? "
to his D. affine.
We at first thought to identify it with the recent D. cardials Dal, which has similar file-like circular sculpture; but upon appealing to our kind friend at Washington for a comparison, the following differential features became apparent: " D. cardmis is lighter ; the fossil form is not so much curved and the elevated lines are distant, with no longitudinal sculpture between them ; the anterior part of the adult carduus has fine longitudinal striae covering the interspaces as well as the elevated riblets."
D. Tryoni differs from this species in the character of the circular stria?
and some other features mentioned below.
Dentalium Tryoni n. sp.
PI.

XI, fig.
22.
Shell long, rather slender, slowly tapering and nearly straight, the very slight curvature mainly posterior ; circular in section ; quite thick and solid.
Sculpture : many longitudinal threads about as wide as the iutervals, alternately larger and smaller, crossed by slightly less strong, regular, blunt, encircling stria?, rising into low granules as they cross the longitudinals ; these striae are markedly oblique, bending well forward on the concave and backward on the convex side of the shell, and toward the larger end of adults becoming irregular and, in part, obsolete.
Aperture and apex not preserved, but both orifices are apparently circular.
Estimated length 90 mm.
in a specimen having a greatest diam, of 8*5 mm.
A fragment measures : length 36, diam.
at larger end 7, at smaller end 4" 7 mm.
The strongly developed and decidedly oblique encircling sculpture is conspicuous and characteristic.
In D. carduus and D. callioglyptum the circular sculpture consists of sharp, raised lamella?
; in D. Tryoni of blunt cords, more widely spaced, and with the longitudinal riblets, enclosing rhombic depressions (PI.
XI, fig.
22).
In the imperfect specimen 36 mm.
long, measured above, there are 33 longitudinal cords and threads at the smaller end, double that number at the larger, where some of the threads are very small.
Besides the alternation in size, there is a more or less marked teudency for every fourth riblet to be larger, on the median portion of the tube.
The largest of the fragments (diam.
8*5 mm.)
has about 84 subequal longitudinal threads.
The increase in number of riblets is by the regular intercalation of a thread in each interval, so that at various ages a specimen would have 16, 32 and 64 riblets ; the increase thereafter being confined to the convex side, where the interposed threads appear earliest at each successive increase.
In the general contour D. Tryoni is not unlike the living D. capillosum Jeffr.

Dentalium ponderosurn Gabb, see below.
This species, described by Mr. Guppy, from the island of Jamaica, is apparently identical, as Guppy has stated, with a form collected by Gabb in San Domingo.
It is a member of the "group of D. quadrapicale " as defined by us in the " Manual of Conchology, 5 — a group distinguished by the quadrangular shape of the apex, the tube having lateral, ventral and dorsal angles posteriorly.
Abund5 Vol.
XVII, p. 31.
31 antly developed in the Pacific, this type is not known to have living representatives in the Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico, although Miocene and Pliocene forms have been found in the southern United States.
In D. dissimile the tube is square at apex (PI.
XI, figs.
4, 5), but soon becomes circular in section.
Each of the angles at and near the apex is pinched up into a narrow rounded rib.
The intervening spaces are fiat and plain near the apex, but soon a median thread or pair of threads arises, and a little later other threads appear in the intervals, until there are 30 to 36 threads, varying in size, in the girth of the tube.
This sculpture then gradually becomes weaker, leaving the larger part of the tube cylindrical and smooth, except for circular striation (PL XI, fig.
3).
The shell walls are unusually thick.
Ordinarily a specimen of mature growth loses a great part of the sculptured portion by truncation, so that the square section of the earlier part of the tube is hardly noticeable.
This was the case with Guppy's type.
The other characters of this species may be seen by reference to the figures here given and to Guppy's original description and figure.

Larger, heavier, excessively solid, the cavity reduced to a small perforation by the excessive thickening of the shell.
Quadrate form and accompanying sculpture very soon disappearing ; form long and slender.
Aperture rather oblique, the peristome, when perfectly preserved, thin and sharp.
In this remarkable form the thickness of the shell wall, when an adult is broken across the tube, is greater than the diameter of the orifice.
The sculpture disappears sooner than in typical dissimile, and the taper of the shell is very gradual.

Shell slightly curved near the apex, the greater part of the length nearly straight ; thick, solid and strong ; rapidly tapering.
Sculpture prominent near apex, weak and low toward aperture.
At and near the apex, hexagonal with six narrow rounded ribs at the angles, but the symmetry often impaired by the prominence of one or more of the secondary ribs ; the latter lie midway between the six primary ribs, for the greater part are decidedly smaller than these, and attain or fall short of the apex according to the age and consequent degree of posterior truncation.
In ihe secondary intervals there arise a variable number of tertiary threads, generally one, two or three in each space ; and at the aperture there is much variation in the number of riblets and threads, different specimens having 36, 40, 52, etc.
In perfectly preseived shells there is seen an excessively fine but clear cut longitudinal striation in addition to the coarser sculpture described.
Growth-strise fine, inconspicuous and oblique.
Aperture slightly oblique, circular, the peristome bevelled to a thin edge.
Apex rather wide, the orifice subcircular, with a minute notch on the convex side.
Length 41 '5, diam.
at aperture 7'4, at apex 2*3 mm.
The largest specimen measures 8 mm.
diam.

A large, solid and markedly conical species, with very little curve, and that mainly quite near the apex.
It is somewhat like D. disparile on a very large scale, and, as in that species, the number of ribs at the apex is subject to considerable variation, although the fundamental form is hexagonal, the tube soon becoming circular.
D. thalloides Conrad of the Claiborne Eocene lacks the fine, clear-cut longitudinal striation of this species, and, moreover, tapers much less rapidly.
Gabb's diagnosis, published after his death, is not very full, and he gave no figure.
As the name imposed by him is preoccupied, we have considered it best to present a detailed description, in proj)osing a new name for the form.

Known only by fragments, the largest of which is probably onehalf the original length.
These indicate an almost straight, rather rapidly tapering but slender shell, circular or nearly so in section, with smooth, polished surface ; growth-wrinkles light, rather irregular, running somewhat obliquely around the tube ; and there is an occasional constriction so slight as to be hardly mentionable.
No trace of longitudinal sculpture.

This is one of those simple species of the subgenus Lcevidentalium which has no prominent specific characters.
It is still readily distinguishable from other smooth forms of the Miocene or Oligocene of this region.
D. pyrum is, perhaps, nearest, but that has a distinctly ovate or pear-shaped section.

Two perfect specimens and several broken ones were included by Gabb in his lot of " Gadus dominguensis" It is excessively slender, quite arcuate, and decidedly longer and larger than G. dentalinus Guppy.
The measurements are from the largest of the unbroken shells.

25, 26, 27.
Shell long and slender, arcuate, much compressed between the concave and convex sides throughout.
Regularly and slowly enlarging from the apex nearly to the aperture, then noticeably contracted on all sides ; on the middle of the convex side having a distinctly depressed, concave area about one-third the width of the shell, and extending from the peristome backward a distance about equal to the greatest diameter of the aperture; surface smooth and glossy.

Dentalium rudis Gabb, Trans.

(n.

The fossils referred doubtfully to Dentalium under the above name are unquestionably the tubes of a worm of the family Serpulidoz.
The fragments indicate an almost straight, tapering tube with no trace of lateral attachment to other bodies.
It is thick and seems to consist of three layers of different structure or composition.
Externally there are eight rude, strongly convex longitudinal ridges separated by narrow grooves, and rendered irregular by rather numerous impressed lines running circularly around the tube, and occasional constrictions also irregular in occurrence.
The ribs run almost straight, on some of the fragments, slowly spiral on others, the torsion being opposite in direction to that of the thread of an ordinary screw.
The largest fragment measures, length 22, diam.
at large end 7, at smaller end 5 mm.
The measurement given by Gabb was from a number of fragments from several individuals fitted together according to the taper (as in fig.
4), and as the latter seems rather regular, his result is probably not far from the truth.
In the present condition of the literature upon tubicolous worms, it is impossible for us to determine the generic position of these remains, but we take them to be something of the nature of Ditrupa, Hamulus or Pyrgopolon ; the massive, sculptured tube being not unlike the Cretaceous groups mentioned.

NEW BRAZILIAN STREPTAXIDJE.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY.
In the course of identifying Brazilian Streptaxidce some time ago, my attention was called to the fact that in the collection of the Academy there were several different and very distinct species labelled " Streptaxis candidus Spix," mainly in the " Robert Swift " and "A. D. Brown " collections.
I was thus induced to reexamine the large species of the group Artemon, to which these forms belong, and to investigate their characters and literature.
Tryon 1 enumerates the following species: S. candidus Spix (including S. Spixianus Pfr.
), S. intermedins Alb., S. regius Lobbecke, S. wagneri Pfr., S. Rollandi Bern., S. Paivanus, conoideus, costulosus and cypsele Pfr., S. apertus and depressus Martens.
S. regius, Rollandi and cypsele I have not seen.
The identity of ■S.
candidus Spix with S. Spixianus Pfr.
is very uncertain.
There is nothing in the collection of the Academy altogether fulfilling the requirements of the Spix-Wagner description, which indicates a broadly umbilicated shell, of 25 mm.
diam.
and half that height.
The larger size of Pfeiffer's shell is of course not significant, for most of these species periodically form expanded lips, which, with further growth, remain visible, varix-like, on the base of the shell; so that the size of apparently mature examples is not a safe specific criterion.
The following forms seem to be new : — S. helios n. sp.
Shell depressed, with low-conoid spire, umbilicate, the umbilicus deep and somewhat funnel-shaped, one-fifth the diameter of shell ; rather thin and not very stixmg, buff tinted ; the surface with varnish-like gloss, very smooth, with only a faint puckering below the suture representing the costulation of the allied species.
Apex minute, smooth ; whorls fully 6£, moderately convex, at first slowly, theu more rapidly increasing, the last decidedly wider than the penultimate (viewed from above), well rounded at the periphery, convex beneath, very obtusely subangular around the umbilicus.
J Manual of Conchology, (2), I, pp.
61-63.
Aperture oblique, roundly cresceutic, the width hardly exceeding the height ; peristome thin, but very slightly expanded below, the columellar margin expanded, slightly recurved, but little impinging upon the umbilicus; Alt.
15, greater diam.
24, lesser 21*7 mm.
; width of aperture 11, height 11 mm.

Smoother above than any of the other large species.
Perhaps Pfeiffer's "Streptazis Candida var.," Chemnitz, edit.
2, Helix, PI.
103, f. 29, 30, is this species ; but in fig.
29 the basal lip is less deeply rounded than in typical helios.
S. tumulus n. sp.
Shell subglobose-depressed, umbilicate, the umbilicus deeply penetrating, cylindrical or well-like, one-seventh the diameter of shell ; solid; white or yellowish with brilliant gloss, the upper surface sculptured with smooth, regular, slightly arcuate, rounded costulse, wider than their intervals, and on the last whorl about 2?
in the space of a millimeter; becoming obsolete at the periphery, the base being smooth with the luster of varnish.
Spire low dome-shaped, the earlier whorls slightly conic.
Whorls 7, very slowly increasing, the last scarcely wider than the penultimate (viewed from above),, rounded at periphery and convex beneath, showing two slight variceal ridges marking former peristome positions.
Aperture oblique, rotund-crescentic, mainly basal, but little wider than high ; peristome not expanded above, becoming slightly so at base, and expanded and slightly recurved at the columellar margin, where it is dilated somewhat and impinges upon the umbilicus.

The outlines of the spire are more convex than in S. spixiarais Pfr., the whorls more compactly coiled, the last conspicuously narrower.
The aperture is rounder and more basal, and the umbilicus decidedly smaller.
Compared with S. regius Lobbecke, this species is less elevated with decidedly narrow umbilicus.
S. capillosus n. sp.
Shell closely resembling S. Spixianus Pfr.

Resembles S. Spixianus in form, but the series of a half dozen spe-' cimens before me differs constantly from that species in the smaller size of the shells and the extremely fine striation.
S. decussatus n. sp.
Shell depressed -turbinate, narrowly umbilicate, the umbilicus deep and well-like, one-ninth or one-tenth the diam.
of shell ; moderately solid ; pale yellowish.
Surface glossy, closely and finely costulate above, the costulre wider than the intervals, about three in the space of a millimeter, and decussated by numerous fine spirals, which cut or indent them but do not appear in the intervening grooves ; the base similarly but less strongly costulate.
Spire low conoid, with the lateral outlines but slightly convex, apical whorls costulate; whorls 6J, at first slowly, then more rapidly widening, the last bluntly but conspicuously angular at the periphery, convex beneath, angular around the umbilicus.
Aperture rhombic, somewhat oblique, angular at middle of outer margin and at junction of the basal with the columellar margin; peristome unexpanded, becoming slightly so below, the columellar margin vertical, dilated above, impinging upon the umbilicus.

Additional Note on the Gastropod Genus Tatea, TenisonWoods.
— Mr. H. A. Pilsbry offered the following remarks: Owing to the incompleteness of our series of the " Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania," and to the omission of an entry in the "Zoological Record," an important note on Tatea, 1 by a corresponding member of this Academy, was overlooked by me in dealing with this genus in these Proceedings, p. 360.
Professor Tate correctly refers Dardania Hutton, 1882, to Eatoniella, following Hutton ; 2 and he further includes Tatea in Eaton1 On the classificatory position and synonyms of Eatoniella rufilabris, by Professor Ralph Tate, F. L. S., F. G. S. 2 Proc.

This union I have proven to be inadmissible on the ground of the totally different dentition of the radula.
Professor Tate's note, therefore, does not in the least affect the conclusions reached in ray paper, viz., that Tatea is a valid genus of Amnicolidce ; that it is not at all closely related to the Bissoinince; and that it is not equivalent to the genus Eatoniella.
It only remains to add that the paper of my esteemed colleague may be consulted with advantage for the full specific synonymy, and for details of the external anatomy of Tatea not given in my own communication.

The following was offered from the Anthropological Section : — The Anthropological Section of the Academy of Natural Sciences views with the deepest regret the untimely death of its late able and esteemed Director, Dr. Harrison Allen, to whose earnest efforts the organization and subsequent success of the Section were mainly due and who served it as Director from its first meeting until his decease.
Dr. Allen's broad interest in the science of anthropology in general and his valuable series of studies in the characteristics of huraan crania in particular, were indicated by numerous communications to the Section, of which one, on a new method of estimating the comparative measurements of skulls, given in October, 1897, was probably his last communication before any scientific body.
The high value and wide diversity of his scientific work, the originality and suggestiveness of many of his views and the deep earnestness of his devotion to scientific research render his death a serious loss to the world of science as a whole, and in particular to the institutions with which he was intimately connected.
By the Anthropological Section it is felt to be a loss which cannot easily be repaired.
The communication above alluded to has been reported as follows : — Comparative Measurements of Skulls.
— At the meeting of the Anthropological Section of the Academy, held October 8, 1897, Dr. Harrison Allen presented a number of Hawaiian skulls, placed in his hands by Dr. Whitney, who had enjoyed exceptional opportunities for their collection.
It had been found, he said, that the Hawaiian people of high caste selected different burial places from those of low caste, the former choosing caves as places of sepulture, the latter interring their dead on the sea coast.
This custom renders it easy to divide the skulls into two classes, whose distinction is also indicated in their characteristics.
He had found, on comparison of these classes of skulls, that they presented wellmarked distinctions, not due to any difference of race, but simply to different habits and conditions.
The skulls of high caste origin were found to have characters due, in his opinion, to higher intelligence and more luxurious habits of living than those belonging to the lower caste, all the differences observed being probably referable to these causes.
In comparing these characters he adopted a special method, constituting a modification of the ordinary method.
Instead of indicating variations by curves, he arranged the numbers representing the measurements of significant features in the series of skulls, in steps, or terraces, each step indicating by its width the degree of preponderance of its corresponding number.
Omissions in the series of numbers were likewise indicated.
He considered this method superior to that of curves, as greatly simplifying the comparisons of a series of numbers, and enabling conclusions to be readily aivd quickly drawn.
This communication possesses a special value in its being the last made by Dr. Allen, whose death took place shortly after its delivery.
The following were ordered to be printed : —
