A REVIEW OF THE AMERICAN SPECIES OF STURGEONS (ACIPENSERIDAE.)
BY PHILIP H. KIRSCH AND MORTON W. FORDICE.
In the following paper we have given the synonymy of the Sturgeons or Aeipenseridae found in American waters, an analytic key by which the species may be distinguished, and a list of nominal species with identifications.
All the species examined by us belong to the Museum of the University of Indiana.
Most of them were collected by Dr. D. S. Jordan, to whom Ave are indebted for aid in various ways.
The variations due to age are extremely great in this group, and some of the characters given here as distinctions may prove to be of little value when a larger amount of material is examined.
There can, however, be little'doubt of the distinctions of the six species here recognized.
We feel also very certain that no other species exist within our limits, and that all of the many nominal species should be referred to these six.
This paper must be regarded as provisional only, as helping to clear the way to a better knowledge of the members of the group.
Characters of the Aeipenseridae.
The order of Glaniostomi contains among recent fishes but a single family, Aeipenseridae which may be thus characterized: Body elongate, subcylindrical, with five rows of bony plates, a median dorsal, and a lateral and ventral on each side.
Each plate has a median carina which terminates in a more or less developed spine, which becomes blunt with age, while the ventral plates are sometimes deciduous.
The skin, between the bony plates is rough with smaller, irregular plates and spicules of varying sizes.
Head covered with bony plates connected by sutures; snout produced, depressed, subcylindrical, conical or subspatulate ; mouth small, inferior, round or transverse, protractile, with thickened lips, and toothless; nostrils large, double, in front of the eye, which is small, lateral ; four barbels in a transverse series on the lower side of the snout : maxillary distinct from premaxillary.
Gills 4.
An accessory opercular gill.
Pseudobranchire small or obsolete.
No bran eheostegals.
Gill-membranes united to the isthmus.
Pectoral fins placed low ; dorsal posteriorly ; anal somewhat behind it and similar ; ventrals many rayed, behind the middle of body.
Tail heterocercal, the lower caudal lobe developed, the upper lobe covered with rhomboid scales.
The vertical fins with fulcra, and all the finrays slender and articulated.
Air-bladder large, simple, attached to the dorsal wall of the abdominal cavity, and in free communication with the esophagus.
Stomach without blind sac.
Rectum with a spiral valve.
Pancreas divided into pyloric appendages.
Large fishes found in the seas and fresh-waters of northern regions.
Most of the species are migratory, inhabiting the same waters as the salmon.
About 20 species are known, of which 6 are found in American waters.
The species fall into two very natural genera.
Analysis of Genera of Acipenseridae.
a. Spiracles obsolete ; snout broad, shovel-shaped, much depressed above ; rows of bony shields confluent behind the dorsal, so that the depressed tail is completely mailed ; gill-rakers small, fanshaped, ending in 3 or 4 points.
Scaphirhynchus, 1. act.
Spiracles present ; snout sub-conic ; rows of bon} r shields nowhere confluent ; the tail not depressed or mailed ; gill-rakers lanceolate.

Etymology.
Platys, flat ; rhynchos, snout.
This well-known species is found in abundance in all the large rivers of the west and south.
Early in May it ascends the streams for the purpose of sprawning.
In the Ohio river it is taken in considerably large numbers and used for food, though it does not seem to be highly valued.
Its habits are much like those of A. rubicundus.

Etymology.
Lat.
acipenser, a. sturgeon; from akis, point ; pente, five.
The species of this genus have been multiplied to more than one hundred, those in American waters have in particular been unduly increased by Auguste Dumeril, who has described about forty from specimens in the museum at Paris.
All of these nominal species are a burden to systematic science.
The changes with age in these fishes is considerable, the snout becomes shorter and less acute, the spines become blunter, the roughness of the plates is generally diminished, and the ventral plates often disappear altogether.
The number of plates is also subject to considerable variation.

Habitat.
— Atlantic ocean, ascending the principal rivers of Europe and North America.
Etymology.
Lat.
sturgeon.
This widely distributed species reaches a length of five to twelve feet and a weight of one to five hundred pounds.
In Europe they have been secured of a length of eighteen feet, They spawn in spring and early summer in the lower stretches of rivers.
Within the last few years the capture of the sturgeon for smoking and for the manufacture of caviare from its eggs has attained considerable importance on the Atlantic coast.
We have examined three specimens about 12 inches in length from the Potomac river, and one stuffed skin four feet long from Boston.
A. sturio oxyrhynchus Mitchill, is undoubtedly identical with the European species A. sturio.
It differs from it only in having generally fewer lateral plates and somewhat rougher stellate ossifications.
But as these characteristics are subject to great variation among all the sturgeons, especially with age, they are not of sufficient importance to be made the basis of classification.

Habitat.
— Mississippi valley.
Great Lakes, rivers and lakes of Northern North America.
Etymology.
Lat.
rubicundus, ruddy.
This species is found in great numbers in the Great Lakes and waters to the northward, and the rivers of the Mississippi vallev, especially very abundant in the upper lakes.
It is a smaller species than those of the Atlantic and has a greater number of lateral plates.
They spawn early in June, in the southern end of Lake Michigan near the shore and the mouths of rivers where they remain about two weeks.
These are the largest fish of the Lakes.
They are taken only within comparatively shoal waters and in some of the bays, and among the islands they are very abundant.
Their average length is about five feet, though it is said they have been taken of a length of 9 feet.
Their food consists almost entirely of shell-fish.
As an article of food they are not generally popular as their meat is too rich in the peculiar flavor of the oil of the fish.
Smoking is the common way of preparing it.
The specimen examined by us was taken by H. S. Bates at Michigan City, Indiana.

Lat.
trans, beyond ; montanus, mountain.
This species is the common sturgeon on the Pacific Coast of North America.
Its size and distribution are the same as that of A. medirostris ; it is however much more abundant.
They run up the larger rivers in great numbers in the spring for the purpose of spawning.
It is one of the most common food fishes in the San Francisco markets, always abundant and cheap.
The meat is usually smoked, and caviare is made from the eggs.
The specimens examined by us were taken by Jordan and Gilbert at San Francisco.
