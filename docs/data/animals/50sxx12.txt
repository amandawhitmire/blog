ODONATA (DRAGONFLIES) FROM THE INDIAN OCEAN, AND FROM KASHMIR, COLLECTED BY DR. W. L. ABBOTT.
1 BY PHILIP P. CALVERT, PH.
D. Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, made collections of Odonata in the Aldabra (Lat.
9° 25' S., Long.
46° E.), and the Glorioso (Lat.
11° 40' S., Long.
47° 33' E.), and the Seychelle Islands in the Indian Ocean, and in Kashmir, which he sent to the U. S. National Museum.
These, by the direction of the late Dr. C. V. Riley, were sent to me for study.
Their consideration is here grouped under two heads.
I.
From the Indian Ocean.
A number of papers treating of the Odonata of some of these islands lying near Madagascar already exist.
As far as they are known to me they are given below, in chronological order.
2 1 Based on collections of the U. S. National Museum, Washington, D. C. Researches made in the laboratories of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.

No previously published records for the Odonata of the Aldabra and Glorioso Islands appear to exist.
Brief accounts of their recent visits to the former are given by Mr. T. Risely Griffith and Dr. Abbott in the Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information, Royal Gardens, Kew, 1893, p. 152 et seq., but these contain nothing as regards insects.
A list of the plants collected by Dr. Abbott in the Aldabras is given in the same Bulletin, 1894, pp.
146-150.
Dr. Abbott's own " Notes on the Natural History of Aldabra, Assumption and Glorioso Islands, Indian Ocean," in Proceedings U. S. National Museum, XVI, pp.
759-764, 1894, mention the Pantala Jiavescens referred to in this paper.
3 In the present paper seven species are mentioned.
Five, from the Seychelles, were already known to exist there, but some additional details on their structure or relationships are given.
Two species are from the Glorioso Islands, one from Aldabra.

Zool.
Soc London, xii, p. 316, 1889.
One male, four females, Glorioso Is., the male and one female dated Jan. 29, 1893.
Mr. Kirby states (I. c.) that his Burmeisteri is " nearly allied to the African T. basilaris Beauv., in which, however (judging from the single broken specimen before me), the yellow area on the hind wings is much less extended, aud the opaque spaces (of which the upper one is much more extended) is nearly black."
In all these Glorioso individuals, the yellow area on the hind wings extends from the base outward as far as the external angle of the triangle ; in the male it reaches backward (caudad) to the anal ' angle,' in the females back to three-fourths of the width of the wing-base; as regards the extent of the yellow area, therefore, these individuals have, in Mr. Kirby 's view, a character of Burmeisteri rather than of basilaris.
On the other hand, the upper basal band of the hind wings of Burmeisteri fills up " more or less of the lower basal cell and part of the wing below [the italics are mine] adjacent as far as the base of the triangle" (Kirby, I. c).
In these Glorioso females, but not in the male, the blackish-brown fills up the basilar [median of Selys, 1896] space (=upper basal cell of Kirby), the subcostal space to the first (1 9 ) or second (3 9) antecubital, and parts of the supratriangular space and of the triangle as well asthe "lower basal cell and part of the wing below adjacent"; this distribution of the dark color is a character of basilaris.
In the Glorioso male the brown on the hind wings is reddish-brown and therefore paler than in the females; it fills the " lower basal cell and part of the wing below adjacent " and extends into the triangle, and is separated from a second, wider reddish-brown band extending from the inner margin to the distal subbasal sector although not actually touching either margin or sector; this second band therefore does not "run from the base of the sector of the triangle " as in Burmeisteri.
I have before me also two males from Madagascar, similar to the one described above, sent to me by M. Martin as basilaris.
Altogether I think that the probability is that basilaris and Burmeisteri are color extremes of one and the same species.
It may be recorded here that in these Glorioso individuals the first pair of legs are blackish like the others, that the genital hamule of the male projects beyond the genital lobe, that the inferior appendage of the male is half as long as the superiors and reaches to the last denticle thereof, the superiors being longer than 9+10 but shorter than 8+9+10, and that the vulvar lamina of the female is three-fourths as long as 9, bilobed in its own apical three-fourths, and her appendages as long as 9+10.
This species has not been recorded from the Seychelles.

One male, one female, Mahe Is., Seychelles.
The male is the same form so identified by M. Martin as he has sent me one of his Seychelle specimens.
The female is like those he mentions in his last sentence (J. c.) "Certaines femelles n'ont menie qu'une petite tache marron tres courte, le long de la merabranule et le surplus de la tache normale est indique' par une teinte jaune brule tr&s clair, presque limpide."
A male in my collection from West Madagascar by Hildebrandt, formerly in the Museum fur Naturkunde, Berlin, where it stood as T. limbata is of the same species and Mr. Kirby's description of Tramea madagasearensis (Trans.
Zool.
Soc, London, XII, p. 317, 1889) also applies here.
Unfortunately even M. Martin does not give a sufficiently full statement of the distinctions between limbata Desjardins and continentalis Selys, and it is not certain that the insect I have described as T. limbata (Proc.
U. S. Nat.
Mus.
xviii, p. 121 ; Ent.
Nachr.
xxii, p. 217, 1896) really is such.
In these two continentalis — the male has the hamule projecting •considerably beyond the genital lohe, the superior appendages are almost as long as 8+9+10, the inferior appendage is almost half as long as the superiors and reaches slightly beyond their denticles ; the female has the vulvar lamina seven-eighths as long as 9, bilobed in its apical three-fourths, the appendages as long as 9+10.

The U. S. National Museum does not possess any more precise data, which is the more unfortunate as such exist for the mammals and birds collected in this region by Dr. Abbott, and may be found in the papers by Messrs.
True and Richmond respectively, in the Proceedings of the U. S. National Museum, volumes XVII and XVIII.
Of the fifteen species ten are well-known as occurring in Europe and a large part of Northern and western Asia, three (Ischnura inarmata n.
sp., Orthetrum hyalinum, 0. triangulare) are Indian in their relationships, one is the cosmopolitan Pantala flavescens and one (Ophiogomphus reductus n.

is allied to Palsearctic species of a Holarctic genus.

He then gives a number of differences which, he believes, distinguish the two forms.
With the more abundant material above cited before me, I find that these differences are not constant, but vary individually.
Even what is apparently the most important of these, the possession by bacchus of a backwardly-directed, conical tooth on each side of the occiput of the female, is of this varying nature.
Of the three females here quoted, one has these teeth less developed than in a female of parthenope from France, as figs.

The close relationship existing between the Odonate fauna of Kashmir and that of Europe, referred to in the introduction of this paper, is clearly seen from the results of a comparison of individuals of this species from France, Kashmir and Japan, as follows : Humeral and second lateral thoracic sutures Sides of the first abdominal segment inferiorly 2^39 Kashmir 1 £ 2 9 France with a narrow black line for their entire length.

I have not been able to find any constant characters to separate the French from the Kashmir examples.

One male, " below 5,000 f", agrees with bidentatus in its appendages (very nearly), in the number of cells (three) in the anal triangle, and in those color differences which distinguish bidentatus from insignia.
It differs from bidentatus in having an apical inferior yellow spot on abdominal segment 1, and a twin apical yellow spot on the dorsum of 4-6, a yellow spot on each side of the apex of 7-9, and a basal yellow spot on each side of 10 ; all the yellow spots on the abdomen are larger than in bidentatus.

[6] xiii, p. 430, 1894), as on the front wings a dark-brown streak occurs in the subraedian space from the cross-vein almost to the distal end, and there is a small, separate brown spot in the same space on the basal side of the same cross-vein ; in the subcostal space of the same wings there are, between some of the antecubitals, small pale brown spots in the midst of the yellow of the anterior margin.
This yellow extends to the pterostigma in all but two males.
The ventral abdominal spots of basilinea are not present.
Recorded from Turkestan (Brauer), Persia and Yarkand (Selys).

Orthetrum cancellation L. Five males, nine females, " below 5,000 f." Recorded from the eastern side of the Caspian and from Persia (Selys).
9.
Orthetrum brunneum Fonsc.
Five males, three females, " below 5000 f" ; two females " 510,000 f." Not distinguishable from European specimens, with which I have carefully compared them, and certainly different from gracile (Albania) Selys and Ramburii Selys.
One female has the discoidal triangle of both hind wings crossed by one vein, but I can find nothing to indicate that it is of a different species.
Abdomen £27-28, 9 27-28.
Hind wing £34-35, 9 34-35.
Recorded from Turkestan (Brauer) and Persia (Selys).

One female, " below 5,000 f," is probably this species, although it is larger (total length 38 mm., abdomen 25, hind wing 29, alar expanse 62), and the thorax is pale olive instead of reddish-brown, which may not, however, indicate more than that this individual is more immature.

Two males, " below 5,000 f." agree with the very brief diagnosis.
Their size is rather large; abdomen 31.5, hind wing 38 mm.

Crocothemis erythrsea Brulle.
Six males, five females "5-10,000 f." ; six males, five females " below 5,000 f." Abdomen $ 21-23.5, 9 21-22 mm., hind wing $ 25-27.5, 9 25-29.
In seven males and eight females, and on one side 11 only of one male and one female, the sectors of the triangle are a little separated at their origin.
Previously known from Turkestan (Selys).
13.
Sympetrum (or Diplax) vulgatum L. One male, " 5-10,000 f.", has the black longitudinal line on each side of the third abdominal segment, the basal line of the frons prolonged iuferiorly in front of the eyes,hamules as described by Baron de Selys (Ann.
Soc.
Ent.
Belg., xxxi, p. 10).
It is of the typical form of vulgatum and not of the race decolorata Selys.
14.
Sympetrum (Diplax) Fonscolombii Selys.
One male, two females " 5-10,000 f." ; one female " below 5,000 f." In the male, which is semi-adult, the yellow on the base of the hind wings reaches out in the submedian space almost to the triangle and more than half way back toward the hind margin.
In the females the extent of this yellow is smaller and like that of European examples.
Previously known from Turkestan, and Murree in N. W. India.
Mr. C. C. Adams and Prof. M. J. Elrod have sent me both sexes from the plateau of the Nilgiris, 7,500 ft., taken in August and September, 1896.
15.
Sympetrum (Diplax) meridionale Selys.
One female, " below 5,000 f." There is a greater extension of yellowish coloring over the bases of the wings than is usual in European individuals of this species, but the other characters agree.
Baron de Selys refers to this species a female from " les montagnes de lTnde."
