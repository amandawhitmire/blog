4 OF THE 1858.
January 5, 1858.
Dr. Ruschenberger, in the Chair.
Thirty-two members present.
Mr.
Slack presented for publication in the Proceedings a paper entitled Catalogue and Notes on the Egyptian Antiquities in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, by J. H. Slack/' which was referred to a committee.
Dr. Uhler exhibited a specimen of nitre which had occurred spontataneously in large quantity, upon the wall of a dwelling formerly used as a stable.
It was remarkable for its purity, being free from lime, ammonia, magnesia and nitrate of soda.
Mr. Cassin called attention to the specimen of Falco polyagrtrs, presented this evening by Mr. J. D. Sergeant, who had obtained it east of the Mississippi.
Mr. Cassin had described the species from a specimen brought from Oregon by Mr. Townsend, but the present specimen was the first he had known to be found east of the Rocky Mountains.
January 12th.
Vice-President Lea in the Chair.
Thirty-four members present.
Dr. Leidy exhibited two plates of Urnatella gracilis, formerly described by him in the Proceedings.
He said the stomachs of these animals contained certain voluntarily moving bodies which he had supposed to be parasites, but which might prove to be generative bodies.
Mr. Lea had recently given him a Unio from the Scioto, upon which this species of Urnatella had been detected â the former specimens were from the Schuylkill.
Dr. Leidy announced the return from Nebraska Territory of Dr. F. V. Hayden, bringing an important collection of fossils, among which were a number of mammalian remains from a supposed pliocene deposit, of the Niobrara River, (L'eau-qui-court.)
January l^th.
Yice-President Bridges in the Chair.
Forty-three members present.
\ \ Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to some remains of a Camel in the collection recently obtained by Dr. Hayden, from the Niobrara River, Nebraska.
He exhibited the back portion of the lower jaw of the animal, which contains the true molar teeth, and possesses a hook-like process on the posterior border, as in the recent Camel ; in comparison with which the extinct species appears to have been about two-third sthe size.
He also exhibited, from the same collection, the fragment of a lower jaw of a species of Wolf, larger than any heretofore described.
Dr. Uhler exhibited specimens of crystallized lead, produced by withdrawing the fused interior of a cooling mass.
The crystals were arranged upon rhombic bases.
He also exhibited specimens of apparently fibrous or columnar lead, produced by exposing a mass when on the point of fusion, to a sudden shock.
He had failed to develop any appearance of fibrous or crystalline structure upon the sawn end of a specimen by etching.
Prof. Booth remarked the resemblance of the crystals to the skeleton character seen in gold, from California and Australia.
He thought the fibrous or columnar appearance not attributable to crystallization, the sides being of variable number, but due merely to cooling, or similar causes.
He had observed a structure resembling this in pigs of Lake Superior copper, in nickel commercially pure, and in an alloy of nickel and copper.
Mr. Aubrey H. Smith, referring to some figures from Siam, presented by him this evening, said the stone head was from the ruined city of Juthia; the bronze figure, apparently ancient, presented still existing characteristics of the people.
January l^tli, Vice-President Bridges in the Chair.
Forty-five memlbers present.
Dr. Ruschenberger read the following : â Hall of the Academy, January 26th, 1858.
Report of the Committee of the Academy^ appointed to confer with a committee of the Biological Society^ on a proposed junction of the two Societies.
Your Committee " appointed to confer with the Committee of the Biological Society of Philadelphia, with respect to the union of labors proposed in the letter of said Committee, and to report to the Academy the terms of the proposal, and also the reasons which shall appear to the Committee for or against such union," has frequently met the Committee of the Biological Society of Philadelphia, and, after free and full discussion of all the points involved, reports as follows : The third section of the Charter of the Academy provides, that " the Society shall consist of members and correspondents," and indicates that they shall be elected individually, each being balloted for, separately.
The practice of the Society since its institution in the year 1812 has been in conformity to this provision.
For this reason your Committee is of opinion that the Academy cannot, consistently with the spirit if not the letter of its Charter and By-Laws, accept any terms of union with the Biological Society, or annex any other society, or absorb any other body of men associated for analogous or identical objects, whatever might be the advantages of such union.
Your Committee might, under a literal construction of the resolution by which it was created, properly conclude this report with a recommendation that the proposition to unite the two societies be rejected.
But sensible of the meritorious objects of the Biological Society, it begs the indulgence of the [Jan. 3 Academy to submit briefly its views in connection with the subject, and to ask the adoption of a measure in relation to it, which, it is hoped, will be entirely acceptable to a large majority of members of both institutions.
In the language of its Charter, the Academy was instituted " for the encouragement and cultivation of the Sciences," and is " devoted entirely to the advancement of useful learning."
Nearly a half century has passed since its institution.
Daring nearly all of this period, the cultivation of the natural sciences has been pursued objectively.
It has been limited almost exclusively to the investigation of specific differences and resemblances of forms, with a view to portraying those which are new and distinguishing them from those previously described, for the purpose of appropriately classing them.
The field of cultivation includes the geographical distribution of the fauna and flora of the earth, whether living or fossil; and the habits, habitat and uses of the various organisms, as well as the regular and irregular forms and chemical composition of inorganic matter.
The results of the labors of the members of the Academy in this wide field, are recorded in its Proceedings and Journals.
But with the lapse of time and advancement of knowledge new fields of inquiry have been opened.
To study natural sciences objectively only, no longer satisfies the disposition of man to pry into the secrets of creation.
He now anxiously seeks to discover and expose the laws of organic life.
He earnestly desires to distinguish primary organic cells, and to ascertain the forces and laws which bring them together, and combine them in aggregate existences, from the lowest microscopic infusoria up through the zoophytes and acalephs to the most perfect form of organization.
He labors industriously to recognize the normal as well as the abnormal conditions of organic structures, wherever met on the face of the earth.
The task is Herculean, and to accomplish it in any degree worthy of consideration, the laborer requires all the sympathy and facilities which only those interested in kindred pursuits know how to accord.
He needs the encouragement which flows from association with congenial spirits.
He needs must be free from the disturbing influences of those who cannot or will not appreciate the objects of his researches.
Such motives induce him to seek fellowship and alliance with those who are animated by a zeal analogous to his own.
Hence it is that many members of the Academy, regarding objective natural history, only as the basis of the pyramid of natural science, have been drawn together; they have joined others entertaining like views, who are not in fellowship with this institution, and organized the Biological Society of Philadelphia, which is yet in its earliest infancy.
Its chief property consists in the acquirements and industry and scientific zeal of its members ; qualities which we should seek to retain and accumulate within the walls of this Institution.
The extensive library, and collections which are daily augmenting, are of inestimable value in facilitating the pursuits of the biologist.
The Academy is pledged to assist " the advancement of useful learning" in all the departments of the natural sciences.
For the reasons alluded to, your Committee has labored assiduously to devise a measure consistent with the Charter and increasing prosperity of the Academy, which shall place all the facilities in its possession within theeasy reach not only of those devoted especially to biology, but also of thosewho may hereafter dedicate their time and labors, particularly, to other branches, and at the same time bind together by bonds of common interest, in one harmonious union, all who are interested either partially or generally in the cultivation of the natural sciences.
For this purpose, and to meet the demands which labor is daily making for division and subdivision, in every branch of human pursuit, your Committee respectfully urges the addition of a chapter to the By-Laws, which shaH provide for the creation and government of Classes or Departments, composed of members, with authority to hold meetings separately from the common meetings of the Institution, and with all the privileges necessary for the successful prosecu1858.]
4 tion of their studies ; but at the same time entirely subordinate to its Charter and By-Laws.
Under a belief that pure scientific zeal is never pretentious, and to avoid the confusion which might possibly arise from identity of appellations of different officers in the same organization, names and titles for the officers of the departments proposed have been selected with a view to practical, rather than to merely honorary distinction, which titles should be clearly indicative of subordination.
Your Committee has never been unmindful of the interests of the Academy, nor of the grave influence which the measure now recommended is calculated to exert on the prosperity of the Academy ; which is regarded to be inseparable from the advancement of science.
After patiently viewing the subject in all its various aspects, it is sincerely believed that only good can accrue from amending the By-Laws as proposed.
But, even should experience prove that expectation has been disappointed, the Academy may be brought back to its present organization, by repealing the By-Laws which it is now solicited to enact.
The provisions herewith submitted, it is supposed, will meet all the practical wants of scientific men devoted to the cultivation of special departments of natural history, and in this way remove every necessity for forming new societies, and in a great degree, if not entirely, annul the allurements which may be held out to members of the Academy, to labor under the fostering care of newly established organizations.
It is designed that the proceedings of the Departments shall be laid before the Academy at every meeting for business, in order that the results of their investigation may be communicated to each other, and particular information acquired by one may be made common to all.
Natural history is not to be abandoned, because biologists prefer to investigate the laws of genesis and vitality, and physicists delight to examine the properties, the influences and motions of the atmosphere and of inorganic matter.
The fields of entomology, ornithology, mammalogy, &c., are neither invaded nor diminished by the contemplated creation of Departments.
A profitable emulation may be provoked among the members of the Academy, by the feature of the proposed organization.
Therefore the interest of the ordinary meetings of the Academy may be enhanced, and the meeting for business will become more generally attractive.
The whole is respectfully submitted.

J. H. Slack. "
Each tomb and sometimes each apartment had a wooden door, either of a single or double valve, turning on pins and secured by bolts and bars, or a lock ; which last was protected by a seal of clay, upon which the impress of a signet was impressed when the party retired.
Remains of the clay seal have even been found adhering to the stone jimbs of the doorways at Thebes, and the numerous stamps found buried near them were most probably used on these occasions."

They usually present a hieroglyphical inscription, either in a vertical line down the centre, [Jan. 7 or in horizontal bands around the body, containing the name and quality of the deceased, with the customary presentation or offerings for his soul to Osiris, a chapter from the ritual or some other funeral formula.
In the hands of these figures are a hoe and a bag of seeds.
Their arms are crossed in imitation of certain forms of Osiris, whose name and form the dead assumed, and the form of their beard indicates the return of the human soul, which once animated their body, to the deity from whom it emanated."

Dr. Leidy made some further general remarks upon the fossil mammalia obtained by Dr. Hayden from the Niobrara river (L'eau-qui-court), duringthe recent expedition of Lieut.
G. K. Warren to explore the Black Hills of Nebraska.
Dr. Hayden suspects the formation in which he discovered the fossils to be of pliocene age.
The specimens belong to some twenty or more species of animals, all of which are distinct from those found in the miocene deposit of the Mauvaises Terres ; and are also distinct from those of a subsequent age.
The forms are, moreover, of more recent character than those of the Mauvaises Terres deposit.
An interesting and remarkable fact, in connection with these remains, is that they indicate a fauna more nearly like the recent fauna of the old world, than of this country.
Thus, among the remains, are those of a species of Rhinoceros, almost the same size, and having the same dental formula as the ^.
indicus There are remains of several species of Horse, and of several new genera of ruminants ; among which are those of a genus allied to the Musks, and also those of a genus closely allied to the Camel.
There are, further, remains of a Porcupine, resembling the genus Hystrix, and those of a small species of Beaver.
The collection likewise contains remains of three species of Wolf, the lower jaw of the feline genus Pseudalurus^ fragments of several other carnivorous genera, and portions of the skeleton of the Mastodon and Elephant, Dr. LeConte said that while he was recently in Honduras, he had examined the Mastodon bed at the village of Tambla, in one of the passes leading from the plain of Comayagua to the Pacific.
He was satisfied of the identity of the remains with ilf.
giganteus.
He had found there a molar of Bos and two or three teeth of Equus.
On motion of Dr. Leidy, by special resolution, the thanks of the Academy were presented to Mrs. R. Pierpont, for the donation of a valuable collection of shells.

Dr. Isaac Hays in the Chair.
Thirty-three members present.
Dr. Leidy made some further general remarks upon the pliocene fossils from Nebraska ; he exhibited many bones, among them the foot of a horse.
He observed, that among all the mammalian remains brought by Dr. Hayden from the Niobrara river, none were more remarkable than those which he now exhibited.
They belong to an equine animal which has the temporary teeth of Anchitherium, and the permanent teeth of Equus.
In both these genera, the permanent and deciduous teeth are alike, but the new genus in early life is an Anchitherium, and later in life a true Horse.
He also exhibited the jaws, with the teeth, of a new genus allied to Oreodon, partaking, like this, of suiline and ruminant characters.
The specimens were discovered by Dr. Hayden on the Niobrara, opposite Fort Laramie, and indicate a larger animal than any of the species of Oreodon described by him.

Mr. Ashmead called the attention of members to a Marine Alga which he had discovered about three years since at Beesley's Point.
From the microscopic structure of the frond, he supposed it to be a Callithamnion, and not finding it described in Nereis BorealiAmericana, he concluded it was a new species.
He had referred it to the late Prof. Bailey, of West Point, who returned it with the remark, " I cannot make this agree with any Callithamnion known to me ; if it were truly dichotomous, I should refer it to Griffithsia setacea^ but without its fruit I cannot decide what it is.
It is an interesting plant, and ought to be watched for, at different times in the year, so as to secure its fruit."
During the past summer, I collected, at Beesley's Point, quite a number of specimens of this plant ; I found them growing in shallow water, attached to old shells and other submerged substances ; but I found none in fruit.
Upon the examination of a number of specimens, I formed the conclusion that the plant belongs to the genus Griffithsia, and is a new species.
Under this impression, I sent specimens to Prof. Harvey, of Trinity College, Dublin, for examination.
I recently received a letter from that distinguished Algologist, and though not with a view to publication, I presume an extract may be presented without impropriety.
Dr. Harvey says : " The supposed new Griffithsia, sent in one of your parcels, is Griffithsia tenuis^ J.
Ag., identical with the specimens in my herbarium, from Agardh himself.
The American plant is a little stronger in growth than the European, but I see no character to separate it.
The fruit is unknown.
Your specimens are not in fruit.
The genus to which it belongs is therefore doubtful ; and I am therefore disposed to think that it will turn out to be a Callithamnion â an opinion I arrived at, because it is very closely allied to Callithamnion thysigerum^ of Australia and Ceylon, the fruit of which is known to me.
Indeed, it is possible that Callithamnion thysigerum itself may be only a variety of Griffithsia tenuis.''
This alga is interesting as an addition to the marine flora of the American coast.
Mr. Lesley described a curious reverse drainage of the uplands bordering the Ohio river on each side, near Ironton, and within the limits of the coal region of southern Ohio and Kentucky.
On climbing the river cliffs about 300 feet, the summit is found to be formed by a stratum of conglomerate about fifty feet thick, and one looks over into bowl-shaped heads of small valleys, delivering their waters backward, and only reaching the river by circuits more or less extensive.
These valley heads*are so close to the great river valley, that short tunnels driven along in the almost horizontal coal-beds would suffice to bring out the ores which crop around them.
The barriers are lofty knife edges or thin walls, or strips of horizontal conglomerate, the place of which in the coal measures is about 500 feet from the bottom.
The dip of the strata is only about thirty feet to the mile, and contrary to the current of the river.
It would be difficult, he thought, to explain this structure by the popular theories of denudation, or any bypothethis, unless subaerial deluges.
Mr. Powel protested against the too constant recourse to immediate volcanic agency in explaining geological phenomena.
In the Pottsville region the strata were often folded and contorted by side pressure from various causes, with no close or immediate local evidence of volcanic agency, it being often seen only far off.
The structure of the Ohio valley now mentioned, might have occurred originally as a mere crack in the conglomerate, perhaps caused by a very trifling local upheaval, or a slight shrinkage, or even a subsidence at a distance, this would determine the original line of drainage, and attrition might, in time, produce such a valley as Mr. Lesley had described.
[Feb. 9 Mr. Lesley thought the valley could not have suffered from volcanic force, for it was tortuous like the suture of a skull, not straight like the profound lines of fault in the Appalachians of Pennsylvania, Virginia and Tennessee."
Mr. Foulke described the Deep River country as one of straight valleys wailed in by vertical cliffs two or three hundred feet high, which he thought were evidently fractures of the crust.
Mr. Lesley described the Kanawha country to show that, if so, then the crust must be looked upon as having suffered a shivering rupture with open and profound cracks running irregularly or aborescently.
But such fissures could not have been filled up, and their sides sloped off to form a country like western Virginia.
Dr. Woodhouse described the canons of the Pacific side, as sometimes sedimentary on one side, and volcanic or metamorphic on the other, and sometimes having lava streams in the middle.

Dr. Wilcocks read a paper entitled " Remarks on an Optical Illusion, by Alexander Wilcocks, M. D." A paper was presented, entitled Descriptions of new Organic Remains, collected in Nebraska Territory, by Dr. F. V. Hayden and others, under the direction of Lieut.
Gr.
K. Warren, U. S. Topographical Engineers, with some remarks on the G-eology of the Black Hills, and portions of the surrounding country, by F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, M. D.'' which was referred to a committee.
Dr. Leidy read a letter from Mr. F. B. Meek and Dr. F. V. Hayden, dated Albany, Feb. 16th, 1858, indicating the probable existence of Permian Rocks in Kansas Territory, from which, at the request of the authors, the following extract is published. "
Some six months since, Major F, Hawn, of Weston, Missouri, to whom we are under many obligations for interesting information respecting the geology of Kansas Territory, sent on to one of us'^ a small collection of fossils from a locality near the junction of Solomon's and Smoky Hill forks of Kansas River.
A portion of these fossils were at once recognized as being types common in the coal measures of the west.
Along with these, however, there were several masses 1858.]
(*Mr.
Meek.)
10 of a yellowish magaesian limestone containing numerous casts of a very peculiar group of fossils.
On examining these, it was soon observed that they are quite unlike any forms known to us in the carboniferous system, and very nearly allied to types considered characteristic of the Permian, of the old world.
Major Hawn was at once apprised of this fact, and he has since informed us of several facts in relation to this formation, which rather go to confirm the view that it may prove to be of Permian age, rather than otherwise.
In the first place, he informs us that the bed from which the fossils were obtained, hold a position, above the well marked coal measures, and seems to have been deposited upon an uneven surface, as though the coal measures had been worn into hills and valleys previous to the deposition of the rock of which we speak."
[Signed, Meek and Hayden.]
Dr. Leidy directed the attention of the members to some fossils on the table, being part of the collection obtained by Dr. F. V. Hayden, in the valley of the Niobrara river, Nebraska.
One of the specimens was the lower jaw of a new species of Mastodon.
It belonged to an old individual, as the last molar tooth occupies its functional position and is considerably worn.
The jaw indicates a smaller animal than the common Mastodon (J/.
Ohioiicus.)
The tooth resembles the corresponding one of M. sivalensis, or of 31. anffusiidens, much more nearly than that of the common Mastodon.
The crown has a much greater anteroposterior diameter in relation to its transverse diameter, than in the latter, and it has six transverse rows of tubercles, together with a feeble tarsus.
The tubercles are crowded instead of being separated by wide angular valleys as in the common Mastodon.
The tooth was compared with that from an unknown locality, characterized by Dr. Hays under the name of 31.
Chapmani; but this more nearly resembles the South American species M. Hurnboldti.
In advance of the tooth, there are no traces of an alveolus for the preceding tooth, but a sharp ridge proceeds from the last molar to the anterior extremity of the jaw.
Dr. Leidy observed he had never seen the jaw of the common Mastodon in the same condition, as the oldest individuals always presented the fifth alveolus filled up, and not completely obliterated.
The species he named llastodon minficiLS.
Dr. Leidy next exhibited part of an upper molar tooth of an Elephant from the Niobrara ; which he suspected to be a species distinct from those previously indicated, though it does not present sufficient characters to establish the opinion.
It is the broadest tooth he had ever seen, being almost five inches, and it has fewer plates of enamel than in any variety of teeth of Elcphas Americanus that had come under his inspection.
The species he proposed to distinguish by the name Elephas imperator.
Dr. Hays called attention to the fact that the tooth of the new Mastodon had protruded more obliquely forward and upward than in the common species, indicating a nearer alliance to the Elephant.
Dr. Leidy thought Dr. Hays quite correct, and that the last molar in protruding forward and upward had gradually displaced two preceding teeth, whose position it now occupied.
He then described the mode of development and succession of the teeth in the Elephant ; and he showed, as observed by Dr. Hays in the new Mastodon, that we have a closer approximation to the same process, than in the common species.
On leave granted.

G. K. Warren, U. S. Topoo;raphical Engineers, to explore the region of the Black Hills, by Dr. F. V. Hayden, Geologist to the Expedition, by Joseph Leidy, M. D." Which were referred to committees.
Dr. Leidy, in presenting his paper intended for publication in the Proceedings, observed that it contained characteristic descriptions of twenty-eight species of extinct vertebrates, among which are six carnivora of the canine and feline families, iwo rodents, eight ruminants, eight solipeds, three large pachyderms, and one turtle.
In relation to the eight solipeds, he stated they belonged to six genera : Equus, Hipparion, Protohippus^ Merycliipj)m^ Hypohiprpus^ and Parahippus.
The two latter constitute with Anchitherium a distinct group ; the three former constitute another group ; and the fourth one is an intermediate form.
The remains of Uquus, indicating one species, are undistinguishable from the corresponding parts of the domestic horse.
Dr. L. further remarked, since he had had the opportunity of inspecting the numerous equine remains from the Niobrara, he was inclined to believe that the remains of the horse found in the post-pliocene deposits of the United States, indicate two speeies.
Of these the remains of one are undistinguishable from corresponding parts of the recent horse, and are the representative of the E. primigenius of Europe, and may be distinguished by the name of E. fraternus.
The other species relates to the E. pliddens of Europe, and like it is characterized by the comparatively complex arrangement of the enamel folding in the upper molar teeth.
He had formerly named it E. americanus^ but as this name had been previously applied to a South American species, he would now propose for it that of E. compUcatus.
The equine remains referred to, together with those of a small species of Hipparion from the post pliocene deposit near Charleston, S.
â C., and those of a species of Anchitherium from the miocene deposit of the Mauvaises Terres, Nebraska, appear to indicate the former existence of twelve species of seven genera of the family of solipeds in this country.
From these facts it would appear as if the equine family was becoming extinct, as it is now represented by the sole genus Equus.
Dr. Hammond said the sections of jet he presented this evening were from a vein eighteen inches in thickness, at Oevolleta.
Under the microscope they exhibited the woody structure very beautifully.
Mr. Lesley exhibited fragments of conglomerate, from under the coal, from the top of Blossburg Mountain, showing apparently the impression of a Calamite, which seemed to have marked or moulded even the pebbles themselves.
Mr. Lea was inclined to ascribe the marks upon the fragments exhibited, rather to the groving or scratching of one rock by another after fracture, as seen in the slickensides.
Mr. Lesley had examined the locality for scratches, but bad found no s^^ch fissure as that suggested by Mr. Lea, besides the beds at the spot are nearly horizontal , 1858.]

The following papers were presented for publication in the Proceedings : '^Descriptions of New Species of Coleoptera, chiefly collected by the U. S. and Mexican Boundary Commission, under Major W. H. Emory, by John L. LeConte, M. D/' Descriptions of New Species of Neuropterous Insects, collected by the North Pacific Exploring Expedition under Captain J. Rodgers, by P. R. Uhler/^ Dr. Leidj called the attention of the members to a cast of a Mastodon tooth from the collection of Dr. Harlan, which collection had for many years been stowed away in a ware-house in this city, and had recently been presented to the Academy by the son of Dr. Harlan.
The cast is labelled in the hand-writing of the Id^iiQv^ Mastodon longirostris WiocQxiQ^ Maryland."
The original specimen is said to have been found in a miocene deposit, near Greensburgh, Caroline county, Md.
For some time it was in the possession of Dr. Ducatel, of Baltimore, and subsequently was deposited in the Museum of that city, Mr. Charlesworth, Sir Charles Lyell, Dr. Harlan and Dr. Hays, who had seen the specimen, considered it as having belonged to the M. longirostris or if.
augustidens.
When Dr. Warren was preparing his book on the american Mastodon, he was desirous of inspecting this tooth, but learned that it was lost.
Subsequently, a tooth, in the cabinet of the Academy, which had been purchased in London as an american fossil, was suspected to be the missing Baltimore specimen, and as such is described and figured in Dr. Warren's work, (The Mastodon giganteus of North America, p. 92, pi.
xxvi.)
This tooth, now on the table, by comparison with the cast, proves not to be the so-called Baltimore tooth, though approaching it in a remarkable manner, in size, general form, and in being fractured at the anterior extremity.
Dr. Leidy next exhibited a tooth from the collection of Dr. Harlan, which Dr. Hays says is the original specimen on which the Tapirus masiodontoides was founded.
The specimen corresponds in size and form very nearly with the description given by Dr. Harlan in his account of T. masiodontoides (Fauna Americana, p. 224 ; Medical and Physical Researches, p.
265.)
Dr. L. added, he confirmed the views of Mr. Cooper (American Monthly Journal of Geology, p. 163,) and Dr. Hays, that the specimen was a first milk molar of the Mastodon.

Dr. Morris, on the part of the local committee of the American Association for the advancement of Science, extended to all the members of the Academy, an invitation to be present at the next meeting about to be held in Baltimore, to which he added the promise of the cordial hospitality of the citizens.
The following papers were presented for publication in the Proceedings : Descriptions of a New Helix and two new Planorbes, by Isaac Lea."
Descriptions of eight new species of Unio, by Isaac Lea.''
Which were referred to committees.
[March s Mr. Lea remarked, that he had received from Dr. Hayden, so well known for his interesting discoveries of the fossil Fauna, of Nebraska Territory, &c., all the fresh water molluscs which he had procured during his journey into those distant and little known Indian countries.
Mr. R. Kennicott, a young and ardent student of Natural History, whose letter Mr. Lea read, had also submitted to him a collection of molluscs made by him for the Northwestern University of Evanston, Illinois, from a part of North America rarely visited by the investigator of Natural History, the Red River of the North, which having its source near the head waters of the Mississippi, runs due north into Lake Winnepeg, which Lake discharges its waters through Nelson's River into Hudson's Bay.
It is not to be understood that either of these collections, made under many adverse circumstances, and at times, of great personal danger, should be full representations of this branch of the Fauna of these countries.
But they are sufficient to prove that zoological life, so far as represented by IIoUuscs, is nearly, if not quite the same, as that of the Ohio River Basin, as well as that of the Missouri River, and a part of that of the Lower Mississippi and Red River of the South.
The knowledge of a part of the species from these remote districts, proves to us the wide-spread distribution of the same species, as we find evenr one of them in the Ohio River at Cincinnati, Marietta and Pittsburg, and this is the more remarkable, as the waters of the Red River of the North are embraced in a different system of drainage, flowing as they do into Hudson's Bay at about 52Â° North lat.
Thus is seen an immense area of country producing in its waters nearly the same life, as regards the Molluscs ; a fact highly interesting to the Zoologist.
The following species were brought by Dr. Hayden from the mouths of the Rivers Big Sioux and James' River, 43Â° north, and 9*7Â° west, Unio asperrimus, Lea.

A. decora, Lea.
Every species from these two habitats is found in the vicinity of Cincinnati, and several of them, viz : Unio asperrimus, anodoiitoides, rubiginosus, and Anodonta Ferussaciana are found in the waters of Louisiana.
Even in Georgia there are two of them, viz : Unio anodontoides and Unio alatus.
Mr. Lea did not wish to be understood that he believed all the species of the Unionidce, which were common in one part of this great area, were the same which inhabited the waters of other parts.
On the contrary, they differed much in the lower Mississippi, but still there are some species which are common in the Ohio, as high up as Pittsburg, which are found in Moose River, of Hudson's Bay, 52Â° North, in Red River of the north, 50Â° North, in Upper Missouri, 4YÂ° North, and in the Big Sioux, 43Â° North.
There are also some others which are common at Pittsburg, which are found as far south as Louisiana, 30Â° North, and in Georgia, 34Â° North.
These facts Mr. Lea believed to be important in regard to the geographical distribution of the species, some of which are found to bo so extensively distributed, while it is well known that some few are restricted, so far as our present knowledge extends, to points embraced within very short distances in a single river.
As an illustration of this, the Unio spinosus, Unio Shepardianusy Margaritana arculn, &c., may be cited.

My Dfar Sir,â I have the pleasure of announcing to you, that I have just completed an examination of some fossils, collected by Dr. G. S. Shumard from the White Limestone of the Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico, while he was connected with the expedition of Capt.
John Page, and I am fully convinced that these fossils are Permian, The collection contains about forty species, a number of which are identical with species of the Permian system of Russia and England.
We have specimens which agree perfectly with Verneuil's descriptions and figures of Camaraphoria Schlotheimi and C. Geinitziana from the Permian System of Russia.
We have also an Aulosteges which^resembles A. Wangenheimi (Verneuil,) though it is doubtless a distinct species.
This genus has not, I believe, been found lower than the Permian.
The Procluctus Leplayi'iQ represented, and there is another Productus which is very analogous to P. cancrini, (Vern.)
The Spirigera pectinifera, (Vern.
sp.)
Terehratula svpcrstes, (Verneuil,) Spirifer cristata and S. permiana, of King, are undoubtedly in our collection, and also Acanthocladia anceps, (King) and Synocladia virgulacea, (King,) all of which are species of the Permian of Russia and England.
Besides, there is a Monotis which resembles 31. speluncaria.
We also recognized several species that are in Professor Swallow's collection from the Permian Rocks of Kansas.
According to measurements made by my brother, these Permian Rocks attain a thickness of more than a thousand feet in the Guadalupe Mountains.
The rock is a remarkably pure white limestone, and portions of the mass abounds in fossils.
It is underlaid by sandstones and limestones of the coal measures, containing the same fossils as characterized this formation in Missouri, Iowa and Illinois, but in New Mexico scarcely a single species ranges from the Coal Measures into the Permian.
I am now engaged in preparing descriptions of the new Permian Fossils.
Will you be kind enough to announce this discovery at the next meeting of the Philadelphia Academy.
Sincerely yours, B. F. Shumard.
Mr, Lesley exhibited a specimen of lignite from the Upper Wachita River, Louisiana, received through Mr. Perry, of New Orleans.
It is remarkable for containing rosin in quite visible masses.
Sometimes the 1858.]
15 rosin is found in masses as large as a nut, sometimes in veins.
It is from a tertiary formation.
Mr. Lea has a specimen of rosin which Sir Henry De La Beche had sent him; it was found with coal in Borneo, and is as large as a hickory out.

[March 19 Remarks on an Optical Illusion.
BY ALEXANDER WILCOCKS, M. D. I desire to draw the attention of the Academy to one of the phenomena oi sight, which is interesting, because I conceive that it has led some zealous investigators of the mysteries of nature into error.
I allude to that power of the retina, by which an impression made upon it by a luminous object is retained, during an appreciable time.
The most familiar illustration of this law, is in the whirling of a piece ot lighted charcoal in the dark.
The result is the formation of a luminous ring, more or less perfect, according to the rapidity of the motion of the hand.
Experience has not only abundantly proved the existence of this peculiarity of the retina ; but it has also determined the duration of the impressions.
It has been found to be from one tenth, to one eighth of a second.
Such at least is true of persons in good health ; but there is reason to believe that there are cases where the duration of impressions is much longer.
If when under suitable circumstances, a luminous body is moved before the eye at rest, we perceive a line of light, we may naturally expect, that when the converse condition obtains, we shall witness a similar phenomenon.
By the converse condition, I mean that wherein the luminous object is at rest, and the eye in motion about one of its own axes.
Requirements so simple are easily obtained ; the most convenient object upon which to make the experiment is the star Sirius.
The precautions to be observed, are to choose a time when the moon does not shine, and the star is high above the horizon ; and a place where the eye will not be dazzled by any artificial light.
The observer must be free from all sense of fatigue, because the eye sympathizes readily with the condition of the body, and any cause that interferes with the rapidity of the motions of the organ, would endanger the success of the experiment.
Experiment 1st.
Let the observer turn his face toward the star, but fix his eyes upon a point about ten degrees to the east of that object, then suddenly placing his eyes upon the star, he will perceive a ray or flash of light reaching from the star to a point ten degrees to the west.
Experiment 2nd.
Keeping his eyes for a moment upon the star, let the observer return them to their first position, and he will perceive that the flash ot light will extend from the star to that position.
Any one who will trace in his mind the course pursued by the image of the star upon the retinae, during this motion of the eyes, will ascertain that these results are precisely what d, priori reasoning should lead us to expect.
In the experiments just described, the flashes of light are straight.
If instead of the star Sirius, we choose for our experiment, the planet Jupiter, at a time when that body is within twenty-five degrees of the zenith, we shall discover that the flashes of light are curved, and the convexity of the curve invariably toward the earth.
It must be noticed in connection with this peculiarity, that any observations upon an object at such an altitude as the one proposed, viz.
sixty-five degrees, would require that the eyes should be much raised above their usual plane of motion.
The physiologist may find much difficulty in explaining why the elevation of the eyes in their orbits should cause the flash of light to be curved ; and why the convexity should be toward the earth ; but, that the facts exist, others may verify for themselves.
The particular interest which attaches to this experiment is from the light which it throws upon the results of some observations upon meteors, the explanation of which has baffled the ingenuity of astronomers.
In the year 1798, Brandes, of Leipsig and Benzenberg, of Dusseldorf, undertook to measure the height and velocities of meteors.
Having established a base line of 46,200 feet, and provided themselves with chronometers, they stationed 1858.]
20 themselves at the ends of the line, and watched for meteors, carefully noting the times of their appearance, and their couraes.
By these means, the observers were enabled to identify twentytwo of these objects ; and the data thus derived, yielded satisfactory results as to height and velocity.
The most remarkable feature of their observations, was, that one of the meteors instead of falling, moved in a direction aioay from the earth.
A curv^e in the train of a meteor with the convexity downward, would indicate a motion from the earth.
Nearly all the phenomena of meteors have been accounted for by theories which men of science regard, if not as satisfactory, at least as plausible ; but I believc/no astronomer has yet had the hardihood to attempt to explain, how a meteor can approach near enough to our planet to be inflamed by its atmosphere, and become visible to its inhabitants, and then move off in defiance of the law of gravitation.
I have detailed experiments which show that stationary objects in the heavens, under certain circumstances, appear associated with flashes of light which are curved with their convexity towards the earth ; and I trust that what I have said will convince the Academy that there is the greatest probability that the anomalous appearance described by Messrs. Brandes and Benzenberg, was only an example of the optical illusion which it is the purpose of this paper to explain.

K. Warren, the Greologist of the Expedition, Dr. F. V. Hayden collected a number of remains of mammals and turtles, from a deposit, in the valley of the Niobrara River (Swift-running-water ; L'eau-qui-court), which he suspects to be of pliocene age.
The collection is an exceedingly interesting and important one ; and the anatomical characters of the specimens support the opinion of their discoverer, that the formation, from which they were obtained, belongs to the later tertiary period.
The extinct fauna of the Niobrara is especially rich in remains of ruminating and equine animals.
Among the former are several peculiar genera, of which two are closely allied to Oreodon and Leptauchenia, of the miocene deposit of the Mauvaises Terres : one is allied to the Musk-deer, and another closely approaches the Camel.

There are also remains of several species of canine and feline animals, of a small species of Beaver, and of a species of Porcupine more nearly allied to that of the old world than to our own recent one.
The collection further contains remains of a Rhinoceros, resembling that of India, those of a new species of Mastodon, and those of a large Elephant.
One of the most remarkable circumstances, in relation with this extinct fauna, is that it is more nearly allied to the present recent one of the old world than to that of our own continent.
From a comparison of our recent fauna and flora with that of the eastern continent, the deduction has been made, that the western continent is the older of the two, geologically speaking, whereas, the Niobrara fauna would indicate just the reverse relationship of age.
A number of similar instances show that totally different faunae and florae may be cotemporaneous, and do not necessarily indicate different periods of existence.

Since the preceding descriptions of wolves were written.
Dr. Hayden has sent to me for examination a specimen belonging to the Niobrara collection, consisting of a much mutilated fragment of a lower jaw of a huge wolf.
The fragment contains the sectorial molar, the two preceding premolars, and the sockets for the tubercular molars.
The teeth preserved in the specimen are much worn, indicating an old individual, but they have the form of the corresponding teeth in the recent Wolf.
The tubercular molars have occupied more than an inch of space, though more crowded in position than in recent wolves.
The last, as well as the first, was inserted by widely separated fangs 1858.]

This species of deer is indicated by a fragment of a lower jaw containing the posterior four molar teeth, portions of two last inferior molars, a small antler, and a small fragment of a second.
The form of the teeth is the same as in Cervus virgmianus, and their size accords with that in full grown and robust individuals of this species.
The antler is perhaps that of a young animal.

This genus and species were originally proposed on a small fragment of a lower jaw of a ruminating animal, belonging to the collection of Prof. Hall, of Albany, and discovered by Messrs. Meek and Hay den on Bijou Hill, Nebraska, in the summer of 1853.
The collection from the Niobrara contains the greater ]3ortion of four halves of lower jaws, together exhibiting a full series of molar teeth.
The form of the jaw supporting the teeth is much like that of the Deer, except that its base turns up posteriorly as in the Musks.
The inferior true molars have much more nearly the form of those of the Sheep than of those of the Deer or Musk.
The posterior two premolars have crowns very much like that of the second premolar of the Deer, and the first is like the corresponding one in the same animal.

This genus and species are founded on several fragments of jaws, with teeth of several individuals of an animal allied to the Camel, and about two thirds its size.
The posterior fragment of a lower jaw presents the same general form as in the corresponding part of the Camel, but is broader at the ramus in relation, with its height than in the latter.
The posterior coronoid process is well de1858.]
24 veloped ; and the upper part of tlie ramus is more strongly depressed externally than in the Lama (Auchenia).
The body of the lower jaw is relatively deeper than in the Camel, though not so robust ; and the two sides are coossined by a comparatively short symphysis.
Six molar teeth form a closed row in the lower jaw, being two additional to the number in the Camel and Lama.
The true molars and the last premolar have nearly the same form as the corresponding teeth of the Camel.
The second premolar is a reduced one from that behind it ; and the first premolar has a laterally compressed ovate crown implanted by two fangs.
In a small fragment of a lower jaw, in the middle of the hiatus, in advance of the closed row of molars, there is the fang of a tooth, which appears to have been a caniniform premolar.
The mental foramen is just in advance and below the position of this tooth.
A foramen likewise exists below the third premolar of the closed row of teeth, corresponding to that more posteriorly situated in the Camel and Lama.
Two mutilated but connecting fragments of an upper jaw present the hard palate more deeply arched than in the Camel or Lama ; and the face narrows in advance of the molar teeth as in the latter.
A palatine foramen exists opposite the interval of the second and third premolars.
The infra-orbital foramen occupies the same relative position as in the Camel.
As in the lower jaw, six molar teeth form a closed row in the upper jaw.
The true molars, though much mutilated in the specimens under examination, appear to possess the same form as those of the Camel.
The last premolar is also like the corresponding tooth of the latter.
The second premolar is like the first one of the Camel, with the exception that it has the antero-internal fold of its crown as well developed as the posterior fold, which it joins at the base.
The first premolar is like the first one of the series in the Lama, having a trilobate, flattened, oval crown.

This genus and species are proposed on two lower molar teeth, in the Niobrara collection, which indicate a ruminating animal of the largest size.
One of the specimens is apparently a first true molar, and is inserted into a fragment of the jaw by a pair of strong fangs.
The crown is two-thirds worn away, and presents the same form as the corresponding tooth of the Sheep in the same condition.
The antero-postero diameter of the crown is 21 lines ; the transverse diameter 11^ lines.
The second specimen is an isolated, nearly unworn, first or second true molar, witli the form nearly the same as in the corresponding teeth of the Sheep.
Its length is three and one-third inches ; its antero-posterior diameter, at the triturating surface, is two inches, and just above the developing fangs an inch and a half; the transverse diameter, in the former position, is seven lines, and in the latter nine and a half lines.
Merycochoerus proprius, Leidy.
The genus and species are based on several halves of upper and lower jaws [March, 10 < i 1 u 6 i I 4 ii 4 i i 8 I i 4 ii 10 1 1 3 i i 3 i i 5 ii 26 of a large animal, discovered by Dr. Hayden in the red grit bed of Niobrara, near Fort Laramie, Nebraska.
The formula of dentition and relative position of the teeth with one another are the same as in Oreodon.
The true molars present a repetition of the form and structure of those of the latter genus, and the premolars nearly so.
The upper anterior two premolars have a greater breadth in relation with their length and thickness than in Oreodon ; and the anterior two lower ones are more crowded in position.
The side of the face turns rather abruptly outward and backward from above the position of the true molars, more even than in the Hog, whereas, in the three described species of Oreodon^ it slopes gradually backward aud outward, more as the Wolf.
The infra-orbital foramen is above the interval of the first and second true molars, while in Oreodon it is above the third premolar.
The malar bone below the orbit is, relatively to the size of the animal, deeper than in the Hog, but in Oreodon it is not more so than in the Wolf.

The formula of dentition, and the relative position, structure, and form of the teeth are nearly the same as in Lbptauchenia.
In this genus, of which the remains of two species, L. decora and L. major, were discovered by Dr. Hayden in the upper miocene beds of White River, near Eagle Nest Butte, Nebraska, the formula of dentition and relative position of the teeth with one another are the same as in Oreodon.
The crowns of the molars are relatively much longer, and at their outer part are more vertical than in the latter, differing in these respects very much as the molars of the Ox and the Deer.
The outer lobes of the upper true molars are separated quite to the fangs by narrow, deep, vertical folds inclining forward.
The inner lobes of the lower true molars are separated by narrow, overlapping folds, and present internal plane surfaces, while those of Oreodon are folded as in the Deer.
The premolars are more crowded than in Oreodon ; and in the case of the upper ones, the most elevated point of the triturating surface is much more anterior than in tlie latter.
The enamel pits of the triturating surfaces of the true molars are very narrow in comparison with those of Oreodon, and in the lower teeth are quickly obliterated.
The canines are relatively small in comparison with those of the latter genus.
In Merychyus, of which there appear to be three species, as indicated by the remains discovered by Dr. Hayden in the pliocene deposit of Niobrara, the folds separating the outer lobes of the upper true molars have the same form as in Leptauchenia, but are not so deep, do not incline forward, and do not divide the crown through its base.
The lower true molars have their inner surfaces as plane as in the Camel, and have their lobes but feebly separated in comparison with the condition in Leptauchenia.
The canines are as well developed as in Oreodon.

The following genera and species appear to be indicated by the more characteristic specimens of the collection.
Equus excelsus, Leidy.
This species is about the size of the largest variety of the recent Horse, as indicated by molar teeth and bones of the limbs.
The teeth do not differ in (;onstitution from those of the recent Horse ; and none of them present a greater degree of complication of the enamel folds on their triturating surface.
Equus (Protohippus) perditus, Leidy.
A second species of Horse, of small size, is especially indicated in the Niobrara collection, by a fragment of an upper jaw containing the posterior four molars.
The portion of jaw is like the corresponding part in the recent Horse, The molar teeth have their crowns about one-fourth worn.
The enamel folds on the triturating surfaces are even less complex than in the recent Horse, and the antero-internal fold or column has the same form, direction and mode of [March, 27 continuation as the postero-internal one.
The space occupied hy the four teeth is about three inches in length, and ahout ten lines in breadth.
Dr. Hayden's collection also contains bones of the limbs which correspond in relative size with the jaw and teeth above noticed.

Mammiferes Fossiles de I'Amerique meridionale, apparently represents a species of the same equine subgenus as the above.
No extent of attrition of the corresponding teeth of the domestic Horse will produce the same appearance indicated in this figure.
Merychippus, Leidy.
This genus is a much more remarkable one than could have been anticipated from an examination of the specimen alone from which it was first characterized.
The specimen alluded to consists of the anterior upper two large molars, contained in a small fragment of the jaw, and was obtained by Dr. Hay den, at Bijou Hill.
The two teeth are intermediate in form to the corresponding ones of Anchitherium, and the upper true molars of the Deer, and they bear a strongresemblance to those referred above to the anchitherioid genus Parahippus.
From the teeth of the latter, they differ only in having their intermediate lobes prolonged posteriorly past the inner conical lobes, so as to make them assume the appearance of the inner lobes of the upper true molars of ruminants.
In a fragment of the upper jaw of a young animal, in the Niobrara collection, apparently belonging to a second species of Merychippus, the second and third temporary molars and their permanent successors are contained.
The temporary molars have the same form as the teeth from which the genus was first characterized would have, in a more worn condition.
They are invested with cementum, though in less quantity than is usual in the Horse, and it is more readily detached, which appears to have been the case in the two teeth from Bijou Hill.
The crowns of the permanent teeth contained within the fragment of jaw under examination have the same form as the corresponding teeth of the recent Horse, with the modifications above noticed characterizing the subgenus Protohippus.

This species was characterized from the fragment of jaw containing what now appear to me to be the upper anterior two temporary molars, from Bijou Hill.
The Niobrara collection contains a portion of the upper jaw, which appears to belong to this species, having an entire series of permanent molars, (exclusive of the small one,) so far worn as to be inserted by fangs.
The series of teeth occupy a space of almost four inches in length and ten lines in breadth.
Merychippus mirabilis, Leidy.
Appears to be a distinct species from the former, of larger size.
It is indicated in the Niobrara collection, by a specimen previously noticed, consisting of a fragment of the upper jaw, containing the second and third temporary molars and their permanent successors.
Another specimen, in the same collection, belonging apparently to this species, consists of a fragment of the upper jaw of an adult individual, containing the back four molars, which are so far worn as to be inserted by fangs.
The four teeth occupy a space of three and onethird inches in length and an inch in breadth.
The two fragments of jaws, above mentioned, have a deep depression or lachrymal fossa in advance of the orbit, as in the Deer, Oreodon, &c. HiPPARION S. HiPPOTHERIUM OCCIDENTALE, Leidy.

PACHYDERMATA.
Rhinoceros crassus, Leidy.
The Niobrara collection contains small fragments of two lower jaws of young animals, a much worn upper incisor, a last upper molar, and an upper premolar, apparently of the deciduous series, of a species of Rhinoceros, which appears to have had almost the same size and formula of dentition as the recent Indian Rhinoceros, (R.
indicus.)
One of the fragments of lower jaws, consisting of the symphysial portion with sockets for four incisors, indicates these to have had the same relation of size and form as in R. indicus.
The upper lateral incisor has nearly the form and size of the corresponding tooth of R. indicus.
The antero-posterior diameter of its crown is two and one-third inches, and its transverse diameter three-fourths of an inch.
The last upper molar, which belonged to an old individual as indicated by its worn condition, is of the form usual in most species of living Rhinoceros.
Its antero-posterior diameter internally is two inches, and its oblique diameter posteriorly about half an inch more.
The upper deciduous premolar has the narrower portion of its crown anteriorly.
The triturating surface of the specimen presents a tract of dentine on the outer wall and summits of the inner lobes of the tooth.
The outer wall has a median ridge externally, corresponding to the most elevated point of its triturating surface.
The anterior border of the outer wall has the same form as the posterior one, but is shorter and more prominent.
The inner lobes are embraced by a strong basal ridge, as in R. occidentalis and Aceratheriiim incisivum.
The antero-internal lobe curves inward and backward, and the succeeding lobe is transverse.
Three conspicuous vallies bound the lobes, of which the middle one is deepest and the anterior one least so.
From the outer wall of the tooth two folds project into the middle valley, and the posterior of these join one springing from the anterior face of the postero-internal lobe, thus isolating a deep pit from the valley.
If the fossil tooth were worn away to a level with its basal ridge it would exhibit four distinct enamel pits ; one corresponding to the outer end of the anterior valley, two for the middle valley, and one for the posterior valley.
Antero-posterior diameter of the tooth externally, 19 lines.
Transverse diameter of the tooth posteriorly, 19 " Transverse diameter of the tooth anteriorly, 16 " Mastodon (Tetralophodon) mirificus, Leidy.
One of the most interesting discoveries of Dr. Hayden in the pliocene deposit of the valley of the Niobrara, is the greater portion of the lower jaw of a Mastodon, most undoubtedly distinct from that species whose remains are so abundantly found in later deposits in the United States.
The specimen belonged to an old individual, as the last molar tooth had protruded and is considerably worn off at its anterior two-thirds ; and it indicates a much smaller animal than the M. ohioticus.
The form of the jaw is like that of the existing Elephant of India.
A single tooth, the last molar, occupies each side of it, and resembles the corresponding one of M. angustidens, of Europe, or of M. sivalensis, of the Sivalic Hills, of India.
The crown measures nine inches antero-posteriorly, and three and a half inches transversely, and possesses six transverse rows of conical lobes closely crowded.
In advance of the sixth molars, preserved in the specimen, no traces of alveoli are left for preceding teeth, but a sharp sigmoid ridge extends to the front of the jaw.
The greatest breadth of the jaw outside the position of the molars is 15 inches.
Length from back of last molar to anterior end of the jaw, 16 Length of the sigmoid ridge in advance of the molars, 9 ' ' [March, I 29 Elephas (Euelephas) imperator, Leidy.
The Niobrara collection also contains the anterior portion of an upper molar tooth of an Elephant of larger proportions than any which are known to us The triturating surface is within a line or two of five inches in breadth, and within a space of seven inches only eight enamel folds or double plates exist.
In the most thick plated variety of teeth of the Elephas americanus which we have seen, in the same space ten folds were counted.
As in the latter, E. primtgenius, and the recent Elephant of India, the enamel plates become worn on the triturating surface into transverse, strongly crenulated ellipses.
The fragment of the tooth has been assumed to belong to an unnamed species from the fact that it was found in association with a fauna very distinct from any previously noticed.
CHELONIA.
Testudo (Stylemys) niobrarensis, Leidy.
The Niobrara collection contains numerous fragments of bones of the shell of a species of emydiform, Land Turtle, from individuals of different ages.
The fragments do not permit the restoration of any extent of either the carapace or sternum, but they are sufficient to indicate that the species grow to the size of the Testudo nebrascensis, which it also resembled in structure and form, except that the anterior and posterior marginal plates are strongly everted, while they are only slightly so in the species just named.

Sir : The accompanying paper, by Messrs. F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, descriptive of New Organic Remains discovered by the exploration in Nebraska, organized by the War Department and placed under my command in May last, 1858.]
42 the disturbed condition of the strata over which he is passing, unmistakable evidences that the hills loomingup before him are not merely elevations left by the denuda,tion of the surrounding country, but monuments of the former action here of those powerful subterranean forces which have played so important a part in modifying the earth's physical features.
First, in passing from the undisturbed overlying Miocene formation, we come ^ directly upon No.
5, or the upper member of the Cretaceous series of the northwest, as subdivided in the published sections of the Nebraska formations.
Then in regular succession Nos.
4, 3, 2, and 1, are passed over, all dipping sometimes at a high angle away from the Black Hills.
* Beyond, and coming up from beneath No.
1, an older series of very similar strata, containing many organic remains, which we regard as Jurassic types, is passed over, as we ascend the hills.
Then we have some fine red gypsum bearing deposites, separated by a bed of limestone containing a few fossils like Coal measure forms.
Next comes a group of well-marked Carboniferous formations, which repose upon a reddish and grayish sandstone of the same age as the Potsdam sandstone of the New York system, â all of which were often seen highly inclined, and apparently conformable.
The Potsdam, in its turn, was met with, somewith remarks in relation to the Geology of the Black Hills, has been prepared for the purpose of being read at the next meeting of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and I therefore, beg leave to ask the authority of the Department thus to dispose of it.
The region embraced by these Black Hills lies mainly between the north and south forks of the Shyenne River, and north-west of the well-known Mauvaises Terres of White River.
Everything relating to it has hitherto been most imperfectly understood.
Situated remote from the great lines of travel to the Pacific, and inhabited by brave and numerous warriors of the Dakota nation, determined to resist the encroachments or intrusions of white men, it has remained an unknown land, especially to scientific men, whose pursuits are viewed by the Indians with superstitious apprehension.
Even the trappers and traders have generally avoided this dangerous locality, and hence the most erroneous ideas have been entertained of the position, direction, extent, and formation of these so-called Hills.
Our exploration of the past year has, however, in a great measure settled these points.
We now know them to be a detached portion of the great upheaved mountain mass occupying the western portion of the territory of the United States, and the most eastern part of it yet discovered.
They form an assemblage of mountain elevations lying between the meridians of 103Â° 15, and 104Â° 45, west from Greenwich, and between the parallels of 43Â° 20 and 44Â° 45 north latitude, the general deviation of the upland being about N. 20Â® W. The highest peaks are elevated about 6700 feet above the level of the sea, and from 500 to 4500 feet above the surrounding country.
The geological discoveries which the exploration has made are of much value to science, and the announcement of a few of the most important ones is the object of the paper herewith submitted.
Mr. Meek has co-operated with Dr. Hayden in elaborating the results from the materials collected, without any pecuniary recompense from the government, Dr. Hayden being the Geologist to the expedition.

in charge of Office &c. * We should state here that the Tertiary beds were also often seen in the form of outliers, reposing uncon form ably on several of the older rocks, even down to the Carbon^ iferous, near the south base of the Black Hills.
[March^ 43 times far up on the higher points of the mountain, resting unconforraably upon the upturned edges of what appears to be a series of very ancient, highl}" metamorphosed sedimentary strata, standing vertical.
Beyond and beneath the latter, the main body of the mountains seems to be made up of a coai se feldspathic granite, composed of large crystals of feldspar, with very small proportions of quartz and mica.
This granite, and portions of the adjacent strata, were often seen traversed by various veins, dikes, and larger outbursts of basaltic and other eruptive rocks.
In order that our remarks may be more clearly understood, we give below a general vertical section of the rocks seen in the Black Hills and around their base, showing their order of succession, and approximate thickness.
It is not, of course pretended that all these formations were seen lying in contact at any one locality; but they were often met with, under such circumstances, and holding such relations, as to leave little room to doubt that this is their true order of superposition.

The upper beds of the foregoing section, as seen along the Missouri, and in other portions of Nebraska, having been described on former occasions, and presenting few important new features, in the region of the Black Hills, we pass, for the present, at once to the consideration of those below, beginning with No.
2.
This formation, it will be observed, augments greatly in volume towards the west, its thickness along the Missouri, above the mouth of Big Sioux River, having been generally estimated at about ninety feet, while here, near the Black Hills, it attains a thickness of two hundred feet.
As it appears to be entirely wanting on the Missouri, near Judith River above Fort Union, and is found to diminish rapidly as we ascend the Big Sioux from the Missouri ; while there are many facts pointing to the conclusion that it is one of the main fossil bearing beds of the Cretaceous series in Texas and New Mexico, we may reasonably infer that the sediment of which it is composed came originally from gome source fi\r to the southwest.
Lithologically this formation presents much the same characters near the Black Hills as along the Missouri, being composed of dark gray laminated clays.
Several of its characteristic fossils were also found near the S. E. base of tJie Black Hills amongst which we recognise Ammonites percarinatus (^UaW and Meek), of much larger size than those usually obtained along the Missouri, and numerous specimens of a Cijiherea, perhaps identical with C. tenuis (RnW and Meek).
Some interesting new forms were likewise found associated with the foregoing, amongst which there is a large Ammonite, having septa somewhat like those of A. placenta, but rounded on the dorsum ; and a large strongly costated Ammonite, with very prominent nodes along the dorso-lateral margins, apparently very similar to a species described by Drs.
Evans and Shumard under the name of J.. Galpinanus ; also a new species of Scaphites, closely related in the structure of its septa to ^.
hippocrepis of Dr. Kay.
It will be remembered, we have in all our published papers, when speaking of that portion of the Nebraska section composing No.
1, expressed doubts respecting its age.
We placed it provisionally as the basis formation of the Cretaceous series, but at the same time stated it was " not positively known to belong to the Cretaceous system."
In our last paper on the Nebraska formations, and their parallelism with those of the States, and the far southwest, communicated to the Academy in May, 1857, after having given all the facts in our possession bearing on this point, we stated that " although the weight of evidence 45 thus far favors the conclusion that this lower series (No.
1) is of the age of the Lower Green sand, or Neocomian of the old word, we yet want positive evidence that portions of it may noi be older than any part of the Cretaceous system."
Although we have little direct additional evidence at this time in regard to the age of this series, as we have always understood it, we now know that from beneath its lower beds, around the base of the Black Hills, there rises a series of very similar strata, as may be seen by the foregoing section, separated from its base by no well-marked line of demarkation, and containing many fossils closely similar to those considered characteristic of the Jurassic system of the old world.
At the same time we have failed to recognize amongst these fossils any forms peculiar to the Cretaceous epoch, or even very nearly analogous to species common in rocks of that age.
The formations above alluded to as containing Jurassic types of fossils, are marked in the foregoing sections A, B, and C inclusive.
But as before stated, these beds often pass so gradually, in their lithological characters, into No.
1 above, and so few fossils have been found near the junction, that we confess we have but a vague and indefinite idea in regard to the particular horizon at which the line should be drawn between them.
Indeed, the general aspect of No.
1, and that of the formations below, are so very similar, and they are all so unlike the beds above, that if we were to classify them by their lithological characters alone, we should be inclined to view No.
1, and formations A, B, and C as forming one natural group, or at least to think that portions of No.
1, as we now understand it, should be classed with the series below.
This view also appears to be the more reasonable when we take into consideration the great thickness of No.
1 in the vicinity of the Black Hills, and the fact that the beds A, B, and C contain a group of fossils apparently more nearly related to lower than upper Jurassic forms.
Inasmuch, however, as numerous leaves beyond a doubt belonging to dicotyledonous trees, closely analogous to the oaks, willows, and other existing forest trees, are known to occur in No.
1 along the Missouri, near the Big Sioux, and in northeastern Kansas,""" and we have a BacuUte from similar beds, apparently of the same age, near the mouth of Judith River, on the upper Missouri, â while we also learn from the letters and notes of our deceased friend, Mr. Henry Pratten, that he saw a species of Baculite in formations presenting the same characters, and seeming to occupy the same position, along the Platte above Fort Laramie, we think we hazard little in viewing at least a considerable portion of No.
1 as belonging to the Cretaceous system.
Another fact favoring the opinion that No, 1, even down as low as we have provisionally carried it in the Black Hills section, probably belongs to the lower Cretaceous, is the occurrence at its base of a bed conl&mmg Amm.onites and Ostrea^ along with Unio^ Planorbis, and Paludina ; an association of fossils which, in that position, carries the mind rather to the Wealden than to older formations.
The occurrence of these forms at this horizon, also leads us to suspect that a considerable portion of the estuary beds at the mouth of Judith River, above Fort Union, in regard to the age of which we have been so much puzzled, may be, as first suggested by Dr. Leidy, a representative of the Wealden, and as we were then inclined to suppose, belong to our No.
1.
The close similarity between the lithological characters of these deposits, and those of some of the Tertiary formations of the north-west, and the estuary character of their fossils, together with the analogy of many of the species of mollusca found in one of the upper beds, (which may be an outlier of Tertiary resting on older formations), taken in connection with the fact that amongst the fossils collected from one of the middle beds (see section, page 124, vol.
viii.
Proceedings, 1857,) there were some fragments of a Trionyx^ regarded by Dr. Leidy as identical with a species occurring in well-marked Tertiary deposits near Long * We are indebted to Maj, Hawn for our knowledge of the occurrence of these leaves in No.
1, as seen in Kansas.
1858.]
46 Lake, below Fort Clark, led us subsequently to think the whole of these estuary beds, near the Judith, might possibly be only an outlier of Tertiary reposing upon deposits of the age of our No.
1.
At the same time, in consequence of the occurrence in them of remains regarded by Dr. Leidyas analogous io Lepidotus^ Iguanodon^ and Megalosaurus^ we stated that "in the midst of evidence of such a conflicting nature, it is unsafe to express any very positive opinion respecting the age of these formations."
Since we know that there is a similar group of beds at the base of No.
1, as we now understand it, near the Black Hills, containing a mingling of freshwater and marine fossils, although we are not sure any of them are specifically identical with those found near the Judith, we are inclined to think our first views in regard to these Judith River formations will prove to be correct, or in other woids, the beds from which the saurian remains, described by Dr. Leidy, were obtained, will yet prove to be a part of the series we include in No.
1 of the Black Hills section.
This view receives additional support, too, from the fact that the Judith River freshwater or estuary formations were often seen much upheaved and distorted, while around the Black Hills the Tertiary deposits appear to lie undisturbed upon the upheaved older rocks, in such a manner as to indicate that the last period of disturbance amongst the strata of this region occured after the close of the Cretaceous epoch, but previous to the deposition of the Tertiary.
The evidence pointing to the conclusion that formations A, B, and C of the foregoing section should be regarded as probably Jurassic, is, first, the affinities of their organic remains ; and secondly, their stratigraphical position.
It is true we do not pretend to have recognized in these deposits any genera peculiar to the Jura ; but at the same time we have failed to identify amongst these fossils any species belonging to genera limited in their range to the Cretaceous system ; while in their specific relations, so far as we have been able to make comparisons, they are nearly ail much more closely allied to Jurassic than Cretaceous forms, if not indeed actually identical with the former in some cases.
This will, perhaps, be better understood by the following comparisons of some of the species described in this paper, from these formations : â â  \st Fentacrinus asteriscus^ n. s. p., from near the lower part of formation C, is so nearly like the Liassic P. scalaris, Goldfuss, that it is with some hesitation we have regarded it as new.
2d.
Avicula (^Monotis) temcicostaia, n. s. p., ranging from the lower part of the bed A to near the base of bed C, is very closely related to M. substriata of Minster, from the Lias.
"id.
Area {Cuculla^a) inornaia, n. s. p., from the lower part of bed A, is very similar to C. Munsteri (Zeiien), also from the Lias.
Ath.
Panopcea {Mi/acites) subelUpticay n. s. p., from the bed C, is similar lo the Liassic forms M. Liassensis and M. Alduininus of Quenstedt.
5th.
Ammonites cordiformis, n. s. p., from bed A, is of the same type as the Oolitic species A. cordatus (Sowerby).
<oth.
Belmniies densus^ n. s. p., from bed A, is scarcely distinguishable from the Oolitic species B. ecceniricus, Blinville, if indeed it is really distinct.
In addition to the above, there are in the collection from the beds A, B, and C, other species we have not yet had time to describe, which closely resemble Liassic and Oolitic forms.
These facts when viewed in connection with the stratio-raphical position of these deposits, below what appear to be lower Cretaceous formations, and as above stated, so far as we yet know, the absence in them of well-marked Cretaceous types, are, we think, sufficient reasons for supposing they probably represent the Jurassic system.-^* On a former occasion we expressed the opinion that Mr. Marcou was mistaken in regard to the existence of Jurassic rocks in the region of the Black Hills.
This opinion waLS based upon the fact that one of us had traversed the belt of country he intended to color, east of these hills, as Jurassic, and found it occupied by Tertiary and Cretaceonjs formations.
We also knew his map of this region had been mainly colored theoretically, [March, 47 It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary for us to remark that the presence of Ammonites and BelemniteSj in the rocks above alluded to, aside from the other organic remains, is alone satisfactory evidence that they do not belong to the Triassic epoch.
It is true the bed C is not known to contain either Belemniies or Ammonites^ but so many of the same forms associated with these fossils iu the beds above, range down into the bed C, that unless it be the lowest stratum of yellowish gray sandstone at its base, there appears to be little reason for suspecting that it may belong to another system of rocks.
In regard to this lowest stratum of formation C, we would state that the fossils contained in it are casts in a bad state of preservation, but as near as we have been able to determine, some of them appear to belong to types occurring in the beds above; we, therefore, for the present, place it provisionally as a part of the group composing formation C; but it is possible future investigations may bring to light facts that may prove it to belong to an older series, though it evidently is not Carboniferous, nor Permian.
Carboniferous Rocks of the Black Hills.
As may be seen by consulting the foregoing general section of the formations seen in and around the Black Hills, the rocks we regard as of Jurassic age, repose in that region upon a group of deposits, the larger portion, at least, of which clearly belong to the Carboniferous epoch.
"We would, however, just here remark before entering upon the discussion of the Carboniferous formations of the Black Hills, that near the south-eastern base of these hills some loose masses of a cherty rock were seen, on more than one occasion, under circumstances indicating that the stratum from which they were derived holds a position between the base of the bed C and the bed D of the section.
Yet as these cherty masses were no where actually seen in place, we have not given them a position in the Black Hills' section, though there can, scarcely be a doubt that they belong to it.
The fossils they contain, or at any rate several of them, are identical with species occurring in a formation in north-eastern Kansas, now known to be of Permian age.
The first formation in the descending order of the foregoing section we are inclined to place, (at least provisionally) in the Carboniferous system, is the bed D, which is composed of a brick-red fine silicious or argillaceous, slightly gritty material, effervescing very feebly in acids.
Although from a hundred to one hundred and fifty feet in thickness, no vestiges of any kind of organic remains were seen in any part of this bed; but it was always found to be characterized by large quantities of gypsum, in the form of seams, layers, and large beds or irregular masses.
Beneath the foregoing bed we have a bluish and reddish gray, somewhat gritty limestone (E of the section), varying from 10 to 50 feet in thickness, anci containing fossils, resembling coal measure forms.
The collections from thip rock consist of a small smooth spirifer^ broader and more compressed than IS.
lineatus, but otherwise somewhat similar, two or three species of 3Iacrocheiluy, two small species of rieuroiotnaria, and one or two species of Bellerophon, all in a rather bad state of preservation, but showing very satisfactorily their generic characters.
and was necessarily based upon very erroneoua views in regard to its topography.
In addition to this, we had found the immense area represented by him as New Red Sandstone, in the upper Missouri country, almost entirely made up of Tertiary and Cretaceous deposits ; while not a single Jurassic or Triassic fosail had ever been found throughout the whole country.
Since the position of the Black Hills has been determined by Lieut.
Warren, we now know the area occupied by the Jurassic belt Mr. Marcou intended to place east of these hills, actually lies rather on the west of their middle portion, and does probably cover some surface occupied by the formations we regarded as Jurassic.
By these remarks we do not wish to be understood as intimating that a geologist is responsible for errors into which he may be led by incorrect topographical maps ; nor do we wish to withhold from Mr. Marcou the credit justly due him for having first suggested the existence of Jnrassic rocks in this region.
1858.]
48 Next in the descending order, we have formation F, which is two hundred and fifty to three hundred feet in thickness, and very similar, towards the upper part, to the red bed D in its composition, excepting that it contains less gypsum; below, it passes into a very hard compact gray sandstone, the whole apparently destitute of fossils.
It will, perhaps, be remembered we mentioned in one of our former papers the existence of some facts which we thought point to the conclusion that the great gypsum deposits of the south-west, might be on a parallel with No.
1, or the lower part of No.
2 of our Nebraska section.
From the great similarity of these red formations near the Black Hills, to the red gypsum bearing deposits described by Mr. Marcou and others, in Texas, Arkansas, and New Mexico, we are now inclined to the opinion that they all hold the same position, and are of course much older than our No.
1.
The entire absence, so far as we yet know, of organic remains in these red formations in the region of the Black Hills, as well as in the south-west, shows that during their deposition the physical conditions in the waters where they were deposited, must have been unfavorable to the existence of animal life.
That the lower bed F, of the foregoing section, is of Carboniferous age, is very probable, coming in as it does immediately above a well-marked Carboniferous formation, and below a limestone containing fossils closely similar to wellknown coal measure forms, two of which belong to genera (^Bellerophon and Macrocheilm)^ not known, we believe, to range above the Carboniferous system.
It is not, however, so easy to determine the age of the upper red bed D. From its stratigraphical position, as well as lithological characters, it might with almost as much propriety be referred to the Permian or Triassic systems, as to the Carboniferous.
Yet as it appears to have been deposited during a repetition of the same physical conditions that prevailed during the deposition of the bed F, we think it is perhaps safer to refer it provisionally, in the absence of palaeontological evidence, to the Carboniferous system, though it is possible both these red beds and the intervening limestone may prove to be Permian.
Immediately below the foregoing formations there is a rather fine grained somewhat gritty whitish subcrystalline limestone (G of the section), containing in great numbers a species of Spirifer, perhaps new, and resembling more nearly forms common in the lower Carboniferous series of the west than those of the coal measures ; along with this a fragment of another Spirifer was found, having fasciculate bifurcating costte, like S. Meiisehachanus (Rcemer), a common coal measure fossil ; also two species of Produchts^ one of which is probably identical with P. semireticiilatuSj and an other similar, but smaller species, with apparently a less deeply marked sinus in the larger valve, and a shorter hinge.
This bed passes gradually down into a yellowish gritty somewhat friable limestone, in which was found a Spirifer having a high area like S. cuspidaius ; and a large PJuomphalus, apparently identical with a species common in the Encrinital or Burlington limestone of the lower Carboniferous series in the west, â the two rocks are fifty feet in thickness.
The succeeding formation is a hard yellowish gritty limestone often tinged with red (H of section), in which were found specimens of a small smooth Terebratula, a small deeply sinuate Productus, and a Syringopora ?
having small, straight, very regularly disposed tubes, about -06 inch in diameter, and separated by spaces about -09 inch across.
In the middle of this formation, which is usually forty feet in thickness, there is often seen an 8 foot layer of bluish rather compact argillaceous limestone, containing a smooth Terebralula resembling T. mbtileta (Hall), but perhaps distinct, and a Productus like P. cora^ in the fineness of its strisB.
The fossils in the collection from these lower limestones (Gand H) are unfortunately almost all in a very bad state of preservation ; so that it is nearly impossible to determine with any degree of certainty their specific characters.
As near as can be ascertained, however, the majority of them appear to resemble [March, 49 more nearly lower than upper Carboniferous forms, though some of them certainly are like coal measure species.
The color, texture, and composition of the beds are such as to carry the mind at once to the lower Carboniferous series, and quite unlike those of any rock known in the western coal measures.
Lower Silurian.
Potsdam Sandstone, At several places in the Black Hills, the oldest Carboniferous bed of that region (H) was seen reposing, to all appearances conformably, upon a bed thirty to fifty feet in thickness of reddish and grayish sandstone, composed of angular grains of quartz, cemented by silicious, and sometimes small portions of calcareous matter.
The fossils obtained from this rock were Lingula antigua^ (Hall), and great numbers of a small shell very similar to L. "prima (Conrad), but from its thickness and structure probably an Oholus; also a shell nearly related to 0. appolinus^ as figured by Murchison and De Vernueil, in#heir work on the geology of Russia, but perhaps nev/, and fragments of a Trilobite belonging apparently to one of the forms figured by Dr. Owen from the lower sandstones of Minnesota.
The above mentioned fossils, as will be at once understood by the Paleontologist, clearly prove this lower sandstone (I) to belong to the oldest portion of the Silurian system, or in other words, to the Potsdam sandstone of the New York series.
The identification of this rock, at this remote point in the far west, we regard as a matter of peculiar interest, proving, as it does, the extension of that formation several hundred miles further westward than it has hitherto been known to occur in this country.
* Metamorphic and Igneous Rocks.
At almost every place where the base of the Potsdam sandstone was seen in the Black Hills, it was found to repose upon what appears to be upturned edges of an ancient series of sedimentary rocks.
These older rocks present the appearance of having their strata thrown into a vertical or highly inclined condition, while the Potsdam, although much disturbed, rests unconformably upon them.
Further in towards the interior of the mountain, and beneath the metamorphic rocks, as already stated, the main body of the Black Hills is composed chiefly of a coarse feldspathic granite and other igneous rocks.
DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW FOSSILS.-^ Pentacrinus asteriscus.
Our knowledge of this crinoid is entirely derived from detached pieces of its column, and other parts, as seen imbedded in a sandy matrix cemented by calcareous matter.
These segments or joints of the column may be characterized as rather thin, small, and very symmetrical pentagonal, star-shaped bodies, the rays of which are usually longer than wide, and rather acutely angular at their extremities.
Through the centre of each joint there is a very small circular perforation, from which five regular lance-oval, petaloid areas radiate, one to the extremity of each of the angles ; the areas being bounded by^rather narrow, slightly elevated transversely crenulate margins.
The above description applies more particularly to the largest sized specimens, measuring about -18 inch across from point to point of the opposite angles.
Associated with these there are other much smaller joints, varying from -05 to â¢10 inch in diameter.
These have proportionably shorter and broader rays, or * Figures and more extended descriptions to appear in Lieut.
Warren's final report.

4 60 angles, which, however, appear never to be rounded at the extremities.
It is possible these smaller joints may belong to another species, though we incline to the opinion that they are only the joints of smaller individuals of the species here indicated.
The star-like surfaces of the column joints above described, present some varieties of form, but usually resemble so closely those of S. scalaris, Goldf., that we are in some doubt about the propriety of considering our fossil a distinct species.
These joints are all much smaller than those figured by Goldfuss, and appear never to have had the angles so short and rounded as some of the examples given by that author and Quenstedt, of F. scalaris.

Inoceramus umbonatus.
We only know this species from an internal cast of a left valve, with portions of the shell adhering near the beak and hinge.
This valve is remarkably gibbous, and the beak, which is a little oblique and near the anterior side, is much produced, elevated and involuted, so as to give the valve the appearance of some of the Palaeozoic univalves usually referred to the genus Capulus.
The aperture of this valve is subcircular, being straighter on the hinge side than elsewhere.
The portion of the shell remaining near the hinge is very thick, and composed of an inner laminated layer, and an external coarsely fibrous portion, the latter being much thicker than the other.
We know nothing of the surface markings, beyond the fact that obscure concentric undulations are visible on the cast.
The remarkable form of this valve indicates that the other must have been comparatively much less gibbous, or, perhaps, bore the relations to this, of an operculum to a univalve shell, as in 7. involutus of Sowerby.
It is the first species of this type discovered in American formations, so far as we know.
Height 3.10 inches ; length 2.38 inches.
Locality and position.
â This specimen was obtained from near Fort Benton on the upper Missouri ; but as it was found by a person unacquainted with geology, at a locality not yet visited by any person familiar with the formations of the country, its position is doubtful.

Avicula (Monotis) tenuicostata.
Shell suborbicular, or slightly oval, a little oblique, usually higher than long ; valves nearly equally convex; anterior side subtruncate, rounding rather abruptly into the hinge above, forming a broad oblique curve below ; basal and postero-basal margins rounded ; upper posterior margin sloping obliquely for[March I 51 ward, but often curving gently outwards just below its junction with the extremity of the hinge line, so as to make the angle of the small, more or less compressed posterior wing not more than eighty or ninety degrees ; hinge line less than the greatest length of the shell.
Beaks scarcely oblique, located nearer the anterior than the posterior side ; that of the left or larger valve more prominent than the other, and extending a little above the hinge ; beak of the smaller valve more compressed, and scarcely distinct from the hinge margin.
Surface marked by small, obscure, slightly elevated, radiating lines or cost?e, which are less than the spaces between, and crossed by fine, nearly obsolete lines of growth, usually most distinct near the upper anterior margin.
Length '60 inch ; height '64 inch ; breadth '26 inch.
The sinus for the passage of the pedal muscle in the anterior margin of the smaller valve is rather deep, narrow, and connected with a deeply impressed narrow groove, which extends on the outside of the valve nearly parallel to the hinge, quite to the beak.
The surface markings are usually rather obscure on both valves, and often nearly obsolete on the smaller one.
Young individuals are more nearly orbicular than mature specimens.

52 Unio nucalis.
Shell oval, moderately gibbous ; extremities ratlier narrowly rounded, the most projecting part of the posterior end being below the middle, and that of the anterior extremity above it ; base semioval, often quite prominent in the middle ; beaks a little depressed, located about half way between the centre and the anterior end ; umbonial region rather gibbous, and rising above the hinge, subangular on the posterior slopes.
Surface marked by fine lines of growth, and more or less distinct concentric wrinkles ; the latter becoming quite small and very regular on the beaks.
Traces of extremely small regular radiating wrinkles are also sometimes seen between the obscure angle on the back part of the umbones, and the hinge.
Length 1-85 inches ; height 1-34 inches ; breadth 1 inch.
"We were at first in much doubt about referring this shell to the genus Unio^ because it is associated with a small oyster and Ammonites Henryi of this paper.
The hinge, however, as far as we have been able to make out its characters, is like that of the genus Unio, and entirely different from Cardinia, and other forms usually resembling Unio.
In the left valve, (we have not seen the hinge of the right valve,) it is moderately thick, somewhat arched, and provided with two posterior lateral teeth, which are elongated parallel to the cardinal edge, and separated by a groove apparently for the reception of a tooth in the other valve.
The cardinal tooth, which is placed nearly under the beak, is rather irregular, somewhat flattened, and a little corrugated on the edge.
In addition to the foregoing characters, we are led to think this must be a true Unio, from finding in the same matrix several specimens of a small PIa~ norbis and a fragment of Paludina.

Right valve more convex than the other, and having its beak more gibbous, elevated and incurved ; but the margins of the two valves are equal, nearly or quite closed, and a little warped.
Surface nearly smooth or only marked by very obscure lines of growth, and sometimes a few indistinct concentric wrinkles near the base.
Length '27 inch ; breadth '29 ; height of larger valve 23 inch, of smaller 20 inch.
We have not yet had an opportunity to see the interior of this shell, but owing to the fact that there is often seen on the posterior side of each valve, just within the posterior umbonial angle, a rather distinct groove curving down from the beaks, directly over the position of the raised internal lamina in our genus Corhulamella, we suspect this species may possibly be found to possess; the internal characters of that genus.

Umbonial region gibbous ; beaks placed near the anterior side, much incurved obliquely forward.
Surface marked by rather distinct lines of growth, which, on the back part of the shell, curve down, parallel to the posterior border, until they approach a small indistinct ridge, or slightly elevated line, passing down from the umbones, when they curve abruptly upwards nearly parallel to the margin of the anterior hiatus, becoming at the same time much finer and more regular, as well as very finely and beautifully crenulate ; on reaching a small, indistinct groove, which curves down obliquely from the beaks towards the corner of the anterior notch, these lines are abruptly deflected upon the anterior portion of the shell extending out over the notch.

Dorsal margin declining slightly from behind the beaks, with a very gentle convex curve towards the posterior end ; basil margin nearly straight, or a little concave in outline.
Beaks small, located at the anterior extremity, scarcely rising above the hinge, incurved and touching.
The surface is marked by small concentric wrinkles, which are much more distinct on the gibbous anterior half of the shell than behind, and crossed by two grooves, the anterior one of which is linear, but well defined (on the cast), and extends from the beaks downwards, and a little backwards, so as to reach the base in advance of the middle ; the other groove is more shallow, broader, less distinctly defined, and extends from the back part of the beaks, obliquely backwards and downwards, just within the subangular posterior umbonial slopes.
There is also a small ridge or elevated line, on the anterior end of each valve, curving parallel to the concentric wrinkles, from the base about half way up towards the beaks, from which point it is deflected abruptly at right angles forward, so as to delineate exactly the form of the angular notch or hiatus of Teredo and Xyophaga; but the margin of the valve, (at any rate in adult shells) extends out beyond this line, so as to leave a comparatively small hiatus.
The posterior muscular impression is long, very narrow, and placed near the postero-dorsal edge ; while the pallial line passes obliquely down near the middle of the valves, and appears to be provided with two sinuses, the upper one being very small, and lower of medium size.

Helicoceras?
tortus.
Our specimen of this species is a fragment, consisting of one septate volution of the spire.
This evidently belonged to a sinistral conical shell, composed (at any rate during a part of its growth) of rounded whorls, which are coiled in an ascending spiral, so far out of the same plane as ,to be disconnected by a free space equalling about one-third the diameter of each succeeding whorl below.
The umbilical cavity left within, is, at its aperture, less than the diameter of the largest volution ; while the whorls increase in size, so as nearly to double their diameter each turn.
The surface is ornamented by two rows of rather low nodes, passing round the lower outer side (the apex of the spire being above) of the whorls, â and small, but distinct annular costas, which of.
en bifurcate at the nodes.
The siphuncle is very small, and in the specimen before us presents the remarkable peculiarity of gradually changing its position in passing from the smaller to the larger extremity of the fragment before us.
That is to say, â at the smaller end of the specimen, it occupies exactly the middle of the dorsal, or outer side, but in passing round it gradually curves upwards, so that by the time it reaches the larger end, it comes out on the summit of the whorl.
Consequently, if it goes on in this way, another turn of the spire would bring it on the inner or umbilical side, â a third on the underside, and the fourth again on the dorsal or outer side.
It is also worthy of note that the lobes and saddles of the septa, and to some extent the nodes, followed the peculiar curve of the siphuncle, so that it would seem the whorls not only form an ascending spiral curve, but are, as it were, at the same time, twisted in such a manner as to change the relative positions of the dorsal and ventral sides.
The septa are provided with six lobes and six saddles, the larger of which are profoundly sinuous and variously branched.
The dorsal lobe is comparatively small, and ornamented at the extremity by two nearly equal branches, each of which is subdivided into from three to five small divisions with sinuous margins ; above this there is a small lateral branchlet on each side, the right hand one of which is bifid.
The superior lateral lobe is considerably larger than the dorsal lobe, and deeply divided by its auxiliary saddle into two large unequal spreading branches, of which the one on the ventral side is somewhat longer than the other, and provided at the extremity by two nearly equal spreading bifid branchlets and several smaller digitations ; the other principal division is less deeply divided at the extremity into two unequal parts, the terminal or longer of which is bifid : the margins of the main branches, as well as of the body of the lobe, are also provided with several subordinate divisions with sinuous edges.
The inferior lateral lobe is somewhat smaller, but in other respects scarcely differs from the superior lateral lobe.
The dorsal saddle is nearly as large as the inferior lateral lobe, but less spreading above, and narrower, as well as more oblique at its base ; while its extremity is profoundly divided, by its auxiliary lobe, into two subequal tripaitite, [March^ 55 deeply sinuous branches.
The lateral saddle is very nearly of the same size and form as the dorsal lobe, but less oblique, and a little more deeply divided by its long auxiliary lobe.
The greater transverse diameter of our specimen is 2-43 inches ; do.
of umbilicus, -65 inch ; diameter of larger end of the whorl 1-04 inch ; do.
of the smaller end -74 inch; diameter of the siphuncle at the larger extremity -6 inch.
The peculiar twisted character of the volutions in this shell led us to suspect it may be found, when better specimens are obtained, to constitute a distinqt genus from any Cephalapod hitherto described.
For the present, however, we refer it provisionally to the genus to which it appears most nearly related.

TURRILITBS (HeLICOCERAS) COCHLEATDS.
Shell sinistral, very thin, and composed of rounded, nearly or quite contiguous whorls, which gradually increase in size from the smaller to the larger extremity; umbilicus slightly wider than the diameter of the largest whorl.
Surface ornamented by numerous small rather irregular bifurcating, annular costae, which first pass obliquely backwards and outwards from the umbilicus above, then curve so as to cross the dorsum obliquely downwards and forwards, but on reaching the lower side, they curve backwards again, in approaching the ventral side.
There are also two rows of obscure, flattened, or depressed oval nodes, one of which passes round nearly exactly over the siphuncle, which occupies the middle of the outer side of the whorl, while the other is placed less than one-fifth of the circumference of the whorl lower down.
The septa are rather distant, and divided into six lobes and six saddles, which are a little unsymmetrical, in their subordinate details, but about of the same size and general form on opposite sides of the siphuncle.
The dorsal lobe is small, and ornamented at the extremit}^, by four small branches, the two terminal of which are a little larger than the others, slightly dissimilar, and each provided witii five or six unequal digitations ; the other two divisions are not exactly opposite, differ slightly in form, and are each armed with about from three to five or six unequal digitate points : above these principal terminal divisions, there are also along the body of the lobe a few small alternating lateral pinnules.
The superior lateral lobe is greatly larger than the dorsal lobe, and very deeply divided into two great, subequal, spreading branches, of which the one on the ventral side is a little larger than the other (especially on the side of the whorl below the siphuncle), and unequally subdivided into three bifid branchlets, the two terminal of which are much larger than the third, and each ornamented by several small unequal, projecting points, the other main branch is divided into two principal, bifid branchlets with many smaller sinuosities and digitations.
The inferior lateral lobe is somewhat smaller than the superior, but in other respects very similar.
The dorsal saddle is small, very oblique, much contracted at its base, and divided above into two unequal variously subdivided, sinuous branches.
The lateral saddle is not so oblique, but does not otherwise differ materially from the dorsal saddle.
Our specimen consists of a little more than half a volution, the greatest transverse diameter of which is 2-34 inches; breadth of umbilicus -75 inch.
Diameter of the volution at larger end, which is a little oval, -73 inch by -64 inch ; do.
of smaller end, which is very nearly circular, -54 inch.
It is not easy to determine, from our specimen, whether this species is most nearly related to the genus Turrilites or Helicoceras.
In the rounded and comparative slender form of its whorls, as well as the large size of its umbilicus, it is more like the latter genus ; while the fact that the volutions are nearly or quite in contact, as is shown by an impression left on the matrix, would seem to indicate that it must belong to the genus Turrilites.
It is probable, however, 1858.]
56 these two types will be found to be connected by many intermediate gradations of form, when larger numbers of these Cephalopods are known.

Helicoceras tenuicostatus.
The fragment upon which we propose to found this species is slender, nearly eylindrical, and increases very gradually in size, from the smaller to the larger extremity.
It makes a remarkably broad sinistral, ascending spiral curve, so as to leave the volutions disconnected, and form a large umbilical space, having a diameter about four times as broad as that of the largest whorl.
The siphuncle is of medium size, and occupies a position above the middle of the outer side of the volutions.
The surface is ornamented by rather irregular moderately distinct annular costae, which occasionally bifurcate, and pass nearly straight around the whorls On the outside of the volutions the costse are stronger than within, and show, a disposition to swell out into obscure nodes.
Length of fragment 1-64 inch ; diameter at larger extremity -49 inch ; do.
of smaller end -44 inch.
We have for a long time past had this specimen in our possession, but always supposed it identical with Ilamites 3Iortoni^ (Hall and Meek, Mem.

After a more careful comparison, however, we find the following differences, which we think are of specific importance, â in the first place, the costas of the shell now before us are less prominent, and encircle the volutions much less obliquely than those of II.
iMortoni ; while the siphuncle occupies a higher position in the dorsum, and the spiral coil of the shell was sinistral, while that of H. Mortoni is dextral.
In addition to the foregoing, there are well marked differences in the details of the lobes and saddles of the septa, which cannot, however, be well explained without the use of figures.

TURRILITES ?
UMBILICATUS.
We have of this species nearly an entire volution, a little more than half of which is septate, but not in a condition to show the form of the lobes.
It is a sinistral shell, the rounded volutions of which are coiled in an ascending spiral, nearly or quite in contact, and increase gradually in size, from the smaller to the larger extremity.
The umbilicus is a little less than the diameter of the largest volution ; and the siphuncle occupies a position in the middle of the outer side of the whorls.
The surface is ornamented by rather distinct, annular bifurcating costae, which, on the upper side of the whorls, curve first obliquely backwards and outwards from the umbilicus, then forwards and downwards, as they cross the dorsum, and on reaching the under side, curve inwards to the umbilicus.
There are also two rows of more or less distinct nodes passing around the under outer side of the whorls, at which the costse usually bifurcate.
Greatest transverse diameter across the volutions and umbilicus 3-20 inch ; breadth of larger end of whorl 1-19 inch ; do.
of smaller end 1-06 inch.
Not having seen the septa of this species, it is with some hesitation we have considered it distinct from T. cochleatus of this paper ; though it differs from our specimen of that species in having less neatly rounded volutions, much stronger nodes and costoe, and proportionably a little smaller umbilicus ; they may, however, be only varieties of the same species.

It j^s compressed laterally, and makes a rather short curve in the same plane, â leaving between the two extre[March, 57 mities, a free space equalling about half the greater diameter of the larger limb ; both ends are then extended in the same direction, and, apparently, nearly parallel.
The surface is ornamented by strong, rather angular more or less oblique annular costae, which occasionally bifurcate on the sides, and are much more prominent towards the dorsal, than the ventral side.
There are, also, two rows of rather small nodes on each side of the dorsum, placed on the costse ; those nearest the dorsum being more prominent than the others, which merely consist of a slight swelling of the ribs.

Ammonites cordiformis.
Shell, when young, rather compressed, but becoming much more convex with age ; dorsum distinctly carinate, in small specimens, much more obtuse in the adult.
Umbilicus one half to one third as broad as the outer whorl ; proportionally smaller in large than small individuals ; transverse section of the volutions distinctly cordate.
Surface ornamented by numerous small costaj, which are largest near the umbilicus, where they sometimes (in the medium sized specimens) swell a little, so as to form obscure transversely elongated, subnodose prominences.
A short distance beyond this, they bifurcate regularly, or are increased by the implantation of others between, to two or three times their number, at the umbilicus.
As they approach the dorsum, they curve distinctly forward, and in passing over it, impart to the dorsal carina, especially in young specimens, a more or less distinctly serrated outline : on the outer volutions of large individuals, the costae are almost entirely obsolete, The septa, which are not very closely crowded, are divided into five lobes on each side, the first four of which are similar in their mode of branching to those of A. cordatus of Sowerby ; but they are less deeply sinuous, and present other differences in their details.

Breadth from umbilicus to dorsum of a portion of an outer volution of large individual 3-50 inches ; transverse diameter of same, near the umbilicus 3-18 inches.
In many respect this shell is nearly related to the Liassic species A. cordatus^ of Sowerby, of which it may be regarded as a representative.

Ammonites henryi.
Shell convex lenticular ; dorsum narrowly rounded, or subangular ; inner volutions entirely hidden : umbilicus very small and deep : surface apparently without nodes or costae.
Septa not very profoundly lobed, rather closely crowded, slightly unsymmetrical on opposite sides of the shell.
Dorsal lobe divided into four principal branches, the two terminal of which are smaller than the others, and usually tridigitate at their extremities ; while the two lateral divisions are bipartite, with more or less sharpely dentate extremities.
The superior lateral lobe is about the size of the dorsal lobe, and irregularly divided into four nearly equal branches, one of which, on the dorsal side, is separated from the others by a deeper and broader sinus, than those by which they are divided ; while the.
other three branches form together a kind of large tripartite division : each of the four branches is provided at the extremity with 1858.]
58 from three to six sharp digitations.
The next succeeding lobe is not more than one-fourth as large as the superior lateral lobe ; it is, on one side of the shell, divided nearly to its base, into two equal branches ; while the corresponding lobe on the other side, is narrower, and rather regularly divided into three short sharply digitate branches.
The remaining lobes are very small, and simply digitate at their extremities.
Greatest diameter 2-14 inches ; transverse diameter 1-33 inches.
This species is remarkably distinct in its internal structure from all the Ammonites hitherto found in this country.
We take pleasure in naming it in honor of the distinguished philosopher Prof. Joseph Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

SCAPHITES LARV^FORMIS.
Shell small, ovate, laterally compressed, rounded on the dorsum; body whorl cylindrical, first extended horizontally from the convoluted inner whorls, then curving upwards a little, after which it bends backwards upon itself, so as to bring the aperture almost in contact with the inner coil; but leaving a free space within the curve.
Inner whorls mostly hidden, forming a small coil at one end of the shell, and so closely rolled up as to leave but a very small umbilical impression : aperture nearly circular.
Surface ornamented by rather small costae which pass round a little obliquely from the inner side of the whorls, to a point about halfway across the outsides, where they swell out into small obscure transversely elongated nodes, and then each branch into two or three smaller costse, which pass very regularly over the dorsum.
The septa are moderately close, and provided with three lobes on each side, of which the superior lateral is the largest.
The dorsal lobe is still larger, and provided with two small obscurely bilobale branches on each side.

Shell large and thick, subcylindrical, more or less compressed laterally, so as to give tlie cross section a slightly oval outline: lower portion tapering to a point, sometimes a little oblique, usually more compressed than any part above, often having a narrow obscure groove on the ventral side, and sometimes a very slight carina on the dorsal side, near the apex ; the groove being more frequently present than the carina, and extending further up from the point: surface smooth.
Alveolus extending about half way down from the summit to the lower extremity, where it terminates nearly midway between the centre and the ventral side ; from this point the apical line passes down, gradually approaching the ventral margin, but curving slightly so as not to intersect it before reaching the apex.
Phragmacone conical, very slightly curved, apical angle 20Â° ; septa rather closely arranged, about twenty of them occurring in a section one inch in length, measuring -72 inch in diameter at the larger end, and .35 inch at the smaller end I siphuncle unknown.
The best specimen we have seen, of the outer horny shell, measures 5 inches in length, and -90 inches in diameter at the larger end ; the alveolus measures [March, 59 about 2.39 inches in length, and .16 inch across the aperture.

Although differing from the previously described species of the genus by the 9th joint of the antennae being nearly as broad as the tenth, I prefer that this and the following species should be placed here, rather than that the number of genera should be multiplied on characters of light weight.
From the larger size of the insect, I have been able to investigate in a satisfactory manner the structure of the tarsi, and find them to be four-jointed ; the 3rd joint is however quite small, and closely attached to the fourth.
On this account, as well as from the elongation of the fifth ventral segment, and the apparently close articulation of the anterior segments, I am disposed to remove Monotoma from tlie Lathridiidae to the Colydiidae, where it may form a group similar in value to the five others into which that family has been divided.

A remarkable genus, which by its form and color recalls certain Gallerucites of the family Chrysomelinae, while the structure of the abdomen is equally suggestive of Psephenus.
It seems by its general characters to belong properly among the Atopidae ; in which family, however, all the genera thus far described have but five ventral abdominal segments.
The head is small ; the thorax is gradually narrowed in front, closely applied to the elytra, and slightly sinuate at base.
The scutel is trilobed, with the middle lobe produced into a point.
The elytra are wider than the thorax, oblong, rounded at the tip, coarsely but densely punctured.
The legs are moderate ; the anterior tibiae are terminated by very short spurs, but I can see none on the middle or l)osterior tibiae.
The anterior coxae are large, leaving only a very short presternum, which extends between them, and abuts against the declivous mesosternum ; the metasternum is short and flat, forming an angle with the mesosternum, which widely separates the middle coxae ; the parapleurae are flat, broad, and project in front ; the posterior coxae are suddenly dilated internally, truncate at tip, with the inner margin oblique ; their anterior margin is curved, with the concavity forwards, and the mesosternum is sculptured with a line parallel to this margin.
The joints of the abdomen are nearly [March, 71 equal in length, but the 3rd and 5th are a little shorter ; the 6th is deeply cleft, very small, and only visible within the emargination of the fifth.

This genus bears a very close relation to Lytta, and has very nearly the outline of certain species (e. g. L. lemniscata) of that genus, except that the head is very much elevated, so that the vertex becomes conical, somewhat as in Rhipiphorus ; the eyes, moreover, instead of being transverse and emarginate as in all Lyttae, are longitudinal and oval ; the antennae are inserted between [March.
the eyes, and the front is therefore narrowed at that point.
The month is a little more elongated, bnt I observe no character worthy of mention in the oral oro-ans ; the labrum is rounded in front.
The antennae are nearly as in L. lemniscata, but shorter, and with the joints less loosely articulated.
The spurs of the posterior tibiae are equal and slender ; the ungues are double, but the inferior part is about one-third shorter than the upper, and is soldered to it, so as to form a large tooth, which does not descend abruptly as in Lytta erosa, but is rather as in L. elegans.
The anterior femora are filiform and uniformly pubescent, having no trace of the slight inferior emargination and patch of sericeous hair seen in most species of Lytta.

The striae of the elytra are <|uite as deep as in that species, but the interstices are less elevated : between the third and penultimate striae, which as usual unite around the apex, are four intermediate strise uniting by pairs ; in the space between the outer two, just behind the humerus, are two short strise each consisting of three or four points.
The dark color on the elytra is seen in the punctures of the strise, at the tips of the loops formed by the strise, at the middle and base of the third and fifth intervals, on the humerus, and along the outer margin.
When the under surface is dark colored, the sterna, the pleurse of the mesothorax, the middle of the base of the abdomen, and the last ventral segment are yellow : the pygidium is yellow, with large brown punctures ; the legs are yellow, the middle of the thighs and tibise being sometimes reddish, and the tarsi fuscous.

San Diego, California ; very abundant on a species of Artemisia.
This species varies much in size and color ; the head is usually dull testaceous, with the occiput blackish or greenish blue ; sometimes the head is entirely blackish.
It is closely related to G. flavolimbata Mann, from northern California, but differs by the thorax being broadly and deeply excavated each side, and again less deeply at the middle near the base and apex : in G. flavolimbata there is but one deep excavation, which extends transversely across the thorax.
In one specimen the elytra are dull testaceous, having only a scutellar patch, and an external vitta olive green bronzed.
In another, the black spots of the thorax cover nearly the whole surface.

A very pretty and distinct species : the yellow margin of the elytra occupies about one fourth of the surface ; internally it is suddenly and deeply emarginate behind the humerous; it follows the contour of the sides almost to the suture, where it is obtusely rounded ; the extreme margin from the middle to the tip is black.

Fifty-one members present.
Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to some fossil remains on the table just received from Dr. Hayden.
They are part of the Niobrara collection, and apparently indicate two additional species of the ancient Camel {Procarnelus).
One of the species is founded on the greater ]3ortion of one side of the lower jaw containing most of the molar teeth.
Six molars form a closed row, of which the back four have about the same size and form as in the recent Camel.
The second premolar is like the third one, and the first of the closed series has a laterally compressed conical crown with trenchant borders.
The caniniform premolar has almost the same size, form and relative position as in the recent Camel ; and in the fossil, in a corresponding position, there is an equally large socket, as iu the latter, for a true canine.
The jaw is shorter but deeper than in the Camel, and it appears to indicate that the species to which it belongs was about the size of the latter animal.
The length of position occupied by the closed row of six molars is six and a quarter inches ; the depth of the jaw below the middle of the last molar is two and a half inches, and below the first molar one and three-quarter inches.
For this species the name of Procamelus robdstus is proposed. '
he second additional species of this genus is indicated by several small fragments of an upper jaw with molar teeth, of an animal about the size of the Lama.
The three premolars of the closed row occupy a position of fifteen lines in extent.
For the species the name of Procamelus gracilis is proposed.
Dr. Leidy added that he took the present opportunity to point out the admirable quality of bees-wax as a means of mending fractured fossils, and of increasing their strength when friable.
If a fossil bone or shell have become quite brittle by the loss of its animal matter, and is dipped in melted wax and allowed to cool, it becomes nearly as hard as the specimen was in its 1858.]

For mending, it had the advantage over most cements that no time was lost in allowing certain parts to dry, which had been united, before others could be added.

A letter was read from Henry Hartshorne, M. D., Recorder of the Biological Department of the Academy, announcing its organization, and the selection of the first and third Mondays of each month as the time of meeting.
Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to a drawing of a curious worm, which he said was obtained from the Schuylkill river, and was interesting from its being more nearly allied to marine forms than any other known fresh water species.
It lives in tubes of mud ; and is about a line in length.
The body is divided into twelve annuli, including the head, which is cupshaped, has two eyes, and supports on each side a process provided with seventeen cylindrical ciliated arms.
The rings, except the head, are provided with four rows of bristles and two rows of podal hooks.
The bristles are from four to six in a bunch ; those anteriorly having a falcate extremity, and those posteriorly being whip-like.
The anterior hooks are in series of five ; and have a long handle with a lancet-like extremity.
The posterior hooks are from fifteen to twenty in a series, and have a long handle with the extremity expanded and serrated on one side.
It appears to be most nearly allied to the marine genus Fahricia.
He proposed for it the name Manayunkia speciosa, from the Indian name of the river in which it was first discovered.

Mr. Lea remarked that when, a few evenings since.
Dr. Leidy made some observations on a few fossil Saurian and Batrachian bones, from the Red Sandstone of Grwynedd, 20 miles north of Philadelphia, and which were collected and presented by him and some other members, some observations were made by Mr. Lea on the epoch of that mass of red and gray sandstone rocks and blackslates.
This formation is now assuming greater importance, and the interest in it has recently much increased by discoveries made by Major Hawn in Kansas Territory ; descriptions of the fossil species, chiefly MoUusca, have been made by Messrs. Meek and Hayden and Prof.
Swallow.
No bones or foot prints have been observed by Major Hawn^ but all the specimens of MoUusca, &c., indicate without any doubt their belonging to some portion of the Permian Formation.
.
[April, 91 The importance of the discovery of these rocks in Kansas cannot fail to impress our geologists, as the existence of any Permian in this country has been long and strenuously denied by nearly all the American geologists.
Mr. Lea believed he was the first to suggest that the Red Saiidstone of Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, &c., bearing foot marks and other impressions of animal and vegetable life, were of Permian origin and older than the Lias,* but not older than the " New Red Sandstone "f of Europe, as supposed by Elie de Beaumont and Dr. Jackson ; and in the memoir which Mr. Lea then read before this Academy, describing the Ciepsi/saurus Pennsi/lvaniciis, of Upi:)er Milford, Pennsylvania, he stated, in regard to the formation in which these bones were imbedded, that he was ' ' inclined to place it among the superior strata of the Permian system.
"J In 1834 Mr. R. C. Taylor considered the coal of the Lignites of Fredericksburg, Virginia to be "coeval with the Oolites."
In 1836 Prof. H. D. Rogers stated that those red sandstones which he characterized as Middle Secondary Strata, " implied a date somewhere intermediate between that of the coal and that of the green sand ;"Â§ and afterwards with his brother, Prof. W. B. Rogers and Sir Charles Lyell, || he considered that part of this system which containes the coal near Richmond, Virginia, was " closely related to the earliest deposits of the Oolite formation of Great Britain ;" and he was disposed to add the whole of the red strata of his Middle Secondary Red Sandstone to these, and " assign them a position at or near the base of the great Jurassic system.
""^ In 1839, Mr. Gesner in his Oeological Survey of the Province of New Brunswick, assigned the variegated Red Sandstone Rock of Saint Andrews, at the mouth of the St. Croix river, to the ' ' Bunter Sandstone," the lowest member of the Triassic.
** The late Mr. Redfield long since regarded the fossil fishes found in the Connecticut sandstone as Triassic ; and a few years since he stated at the meeting of the American Association at Cincinnati, that this formation was characterized by a flora and fauna as recent as the Trias.
In this, Prof. Agassiz difi'ered from him, as he placed this formation at the base of the Liassic series.
In a note, to a memoir on BatJo/gnatus borealis by Dr. Leidy,f f Mr. Dawson in reference to the older rocks of Prince Edward Island, says, " these beds may either belong to the top of the carboniferous system, or to an overlying deposit of the Permian or Triassic age, and in either case the red sandstones which conformably overlie them will be equivalent to the New Red of Western Nova Scotia and Connecticut, and probably Triassic or Permian."
These views tend to confirm Mr. Lea's, published several years before ; and, subsequently Prof. Emmons, who thought in 1853, that the red sandstones of North Carolina belonged to the Trias, changed his views in 1856, and while confirming Mr. Lea's as regarded the existence of the Permian, divided the well marked beds of Deep River, in North CarolinaÂ§Â§ into Permian and Trias, with their inferior divisions stating their equivalency to the European systems, and he considers the Chatham series of North Carolina, the Newark series of New Jersey?
and the Greenfield series of Connecticut Valley, to represent one epoch belonging to the Permian.
The Gwynedd series and that of Phoenixville, being evidently of the same horizon with the above mentioned.
Prof. Emmons agrees with Mr. Lea, in referring these rocks to the Permian epoch, identified as they are in North *Mr. Dawson, in Journ.
Geological Soc, 1847, stated that the Red Sandstone of Prince Edward Island and Connecticut may be the same, and may be regarded as a post carboniferous deposit of uncertain age.

In 1855 Mr. Marcou published his " Carte Geologique des Etats-Unis," and in his explanations published at length, he gives an enormous extent on both sides of the Rocky Mountains to the Red Sandstone formation, which he dirides into four sections.
As to the Red Sandstone of New Jersey, he places it on a horizon with the Aluschelkalk of Germany, the upper portion of the Triassic, (page 58.)
Mr. Lea stated that his chief reasons in 1852 for attributing to these deposits a greater age than was given to them by other American geologists, arose from the fact that the vertebrae and teeth of the Clepsysaurus, which he then described, were very analogous the Thecodontosaurus antiquus, described by Riley and Stutsbury from the Magnesian limestone of Bristol, New England.
More recently we have the opinion of Prof. Heer, of Zurich, distinguished for his knowledge of fossil plants and insects, who has examined specimens sent to him by Prof. Emmons.
He states that these plants are characteristic of the Keuper, and that none of those of Virginia and North Carolina are really Oolitic.
And it seems, too, that Sir Charles Lyeil, who has examined so carefully and frequently these red sandstone rocks in America, has changed his former opinions, and come to the conclusion that the Richmond and North Carolina coal series belong to the " Permian, or else to the Buuter sandstone.
''* In a communication made by Prof. Emmons to the American Association of Science last August, he said that the question of the Permian age of the bituminous slates and lower sandstones of North Carolina must turn upon the age of the Bristol beds of England, the epoch of which is doubted by some English geologists.
Mr. Lea wished it to be remembered that his conclusions in 1852 were based on the almost universal opinion, in England, that the Bristol beds were Permian, and he referred the rocks in which were found his Clepsysaurns to the same horizon.
Note.
â On the southern side, the New Red Sandstone of Pennsylvania com-, mences on the river Delaware above Morrisville, opposite to Trenton, N. J., passing near Willow Grove, below Norristown, Phoenixville and Ephrata, it crosses the Susquehanna at Bainbridge.
On the northern side it commences at Kentnerville, on the Delaware, about thirty miles above Morrisville, passing through Upper Milford township, it crosses the Schuylkill river about two miles below Reading, and passes out of the State at High Spire, above Middletown, the width here being reduced to about ten miles.

â Found adhering to the outer surface of the renal organ, and the upper margin of the foot, within the cleft of the upper branchial cavity of Anodonta Jiuviatilis and A. lacustris.
Remarks.
â This curious parasite, though allied to Aspidogaster conchicola, is certainly distinct ; and it never occupies the locality of the latter, which also is found in the pericardium of Anodonta Jiuviatilis and A. lacustris.
It is an interesting fact that in accordance with its exterior position Cotylaspis possesses well developed eyes, while the imprisoned Aspidogaster is hlind.
It has occurred to me that perhaps these two genera may represent two different stages of existence of the same animal.

And were referred to Committees.
Mr. Taylor stated that, at a meeting of the Academy, on the 16th of February, lie made a verbal communication, announcing the discovery of a probably new mineral in crystals, which had been brought from the cave of Las Piedras, Honduras, by his friend, Dr. John L. LeConte.
By a qualitative analysis, he found it to be an anhydrous Sulphate of Potash, containing Ammonia.
Prof, Dana, of New Haven, to whom he had sent two of the crystals, very kindly measured them, and found a difference in the angle of the trimetric prism sufficient to separate it from Glaserite, to which it was first referred.
The difference of angle being about in ratio to that existing between Barytes, Anhydrite.
Celestine, Anglesite, &c., isomorphous anyhydrous sulphates.
He hoped soon to show, by a quantitative analysis, that it is worthy of being considered u new species.
He regretted very much that this preliminary notice, which is recorded in the rough minutes of the meeting referred to, should not liave appeared in the printed Proceedings for that month.
Mr. Foulke asked the attention of the Academy to the fact that in the published Proceedings, under date of 16th February last, his name had been accidentally printed in connection with remarks which had never been made by him.

Mr. Vaux in the Chair.
Thirty-one members present.
A communication was read from Dr. Isaac I. Hayes, announcing his desire to attempt a further exploration of the Arctic regions, and asking for such suggestions from the Academy as might assist in carrying out the project.
Whereupon the following resolutions were adopted : Resolved^ That the Academy has heard with great interest the communication of Dr. Isaac I. Playes, of his purpose to attempt a further exploration of the Arctic regions.
Resolved, That the Academy will hereafter give to Dr. Hayes such recommendations respecting the subjects proposed by him, as shall be deemed most likely to promote the objects of the Academy.
Resolved, That a committee of seven be appointed to co-operate on behalf of the Academy with Dr. Hayes.
The Committee was then appointed, as follows : Messrs. J. F. Frazer, T. B. Wilson, I. Lea, W. P. Foulke, J. L. LeConte, J. Leidy, and W. S. W. Ruschenberger ; subsequently, on motion, Messrs. E. Durand and J. Carson were added to the Committee.

^'^1 _ Mr. Lea exhibited some remarkable specimens of Unionidje, six to eight inches wide.
Some of these had the soft parts, and he called attention to two fine specimens of Margaritana complanata, and Unio muUiplicatuSy both females, with the oviducts fully charged with embryonic shells, ready to be discharged by the parents.
There were two important points he wished to be noticed.. 1st.
The enormous quantity of young in the mass of the outer branchise of the Margaritana^ (the branchiae were 3 x H X ^inches,) each specimen containing probably several millions of individuals.
2nd.
That the Unio mulliplicatus was peculiar in having both lobes on both sides, charged with embryonic shells, containing no doubt several millions of individuals.
This species of Unio is the only one Mr. Lea had ever observed furnished with oviducts in all the four leaver of the branchiae.
It is very probable that half a dozen of these Mollusca would produce individuals equal in nnmber to the population of the whole United States.
Mr. Cassin announced the death of Dr. Robert Hare, late a member of the Academy.

1858.J 116 Shell broadly umbilicated ; orbicularly-depressed ; solid ; lightly decussated by incremental striae, and numerous fine spiral lines: color black or reddish brown, under the epidermis white and shining ; suture deeply impressed; spire depressed ; whorls 6, regularly increasing, the upper ones flattened, the last (jonvex, rounded below, and slightly deflected at the aperture; umbilicus broad, showing all the volutions clearly; aperture oblique, transversely-lunar ; in young specimens the decussated sculpturing of the shell on the parietal wall of the aperture is covered with a light callus as the animal grows, and elegantly marked with numerous fine, crowded, spiral lines ; in mature specimens this beautiful marking is entirely obliterated by the deposition of callus, but oa breaking the shell, the lines will be found to exist within ; peristome simple, acute, thickened within, ends slightly approximated, joined with a white callus.
This species bears no close resemblance to any known American Helix.
It belongs to the same group as H. Vancouver e7isis, Lea, but diff"ers in size, color, number of whorls, umbilicus, want of peculiar depression of the lip, by its beautifully decussated surface, and peculiar parietal wall of the aperture.
I know of no species sharing this last beautiful peculiarity.
In form alone, dead specimens may be compared with B. algira, Lin., of Europe, but the spire is flatter and umbilicus larger.

Bidscription of a Phyllostome Bat from California, in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, BY S. F. BAIRD.
Macrotus Californicus Baird.
California Leafed-nosed bat.
The ears of this species are very large, scantily haired, ovate and rounded at the tip.
Their outer edge extends forward to a little behind and below the eye ; the inner edge is partially free.
The two ears are connected by a membrane, which takes its rise about one-twentieth of an inch behind the anterior free edge of the ear, and is united to the corresponding strip of membrane of the opposite side, so as to form a kind of roof over the middle of the head, the entrance posterior.
The tragus is narrow, lanceolate, naked and one-third the height of the ear.
The nasal appendage is short, but rather higher than wide, and extending on the side and beneath the nostrils as a narrow margin.
It is coated rather closely with short hairs.
The lower jaw is slightly fissured anteriorly, with a small narrow wart on each side of the fissure ; a groove or furrow extends from the fissure along each side the lower jaw.
[May, 117 The feet are entirely free ; the spur about as long : the membrane extending between the spurs is slightly concave, leaving the extremity of the tail free for the last joint, or for about one-sixth of its total length.
The general color is a pale brownish gray, darker above than below.
Length to occiput 1.00 Length of tragus .42 " to root of tail 2.60 " of leaf of nose .30 " of tail 1.50 Wing, from carpal joint 3.00 of ears 1.10 Fore-arm 2.00 This species closely resembles the M. Waterhousii, of Grray, from the West Indies.
It differs, however, in the longer tail and shorter appendage of the nose, as well as in the widely different locality.
It is to the genus Macrotus, of the subfamily Megadermata, that the first leafnosed bat ever positively known as an inhabitant of the United States belongs.
It was discovered at Fort Yuma, California, by Major G-.
H. Thomas, U. S. A.
It is true that the Brachyphyllum cavernarum of the Phyllostomata has been given as occurring in South Carolina, but the statement has never been verified by any of the numerous corps of excellent naturalists resident in that State, and is probably an error.

J. L. LeConte, M. D. Memoranda of the eflPects of Carburetted Hydrogen Gas upon a collection of exotic Plants.
BY GE#RGE W. FAHNESTOCK.
During tbe prevalence of severe cold weather in the latter part of January, and first few days in February, 1857, the earth was frozen to an unusual depth.
Beneath the stone pavements in the streets of Philadelphia, the frost penetrated to a depth of more than three feet.
In the neighborhood of Arch and Eighteenth streets, and along both, those streets for the distance of nearly one hundred yards, the escape of gas from the main pipes under the street had been remarked for several weeks.
Leaks at the joints had probably existed for months, although, the porous nature of the soil had allowed the gas to diffuse itself, and find numerous vents at the surface.
But the solid crust of frozen earth forced it to seek other channels of escape.
At this time, with the thermometer ranging from zero to 10'' or 15^ Fahrenheit, a current of gas, penetrating the imperfectly secured joints of the main [May.
119 pipes, made its way beneath, the eastern foundation wall of the greenhouse of B.
A, Fahnestock, on the southwest corner of Arch and Eighteenth Streets.
* When entering the houses on the morning of the first of February, the odor of gas was perceptible, which, on examination, was found issuing in a tolerably strong current through the ground near the north eastern corner of the greenhouse.
It came up through a prepared border of soil between the wall of the house, and the flagging of the greenhouse floor.
Although somewhat relieved by ventilation during the day, it was impossible to prevent its accumulation through the night ; and by the following morning the work of destruction was accomplished.
A choice and beautiful collection, numbering over three thousand plants, was, for the time being, almost utterly ruined.
Many of the specimen plants were unique, and but rarely found in American collections.
The house, which a day or two before had given promise of an abundant succession of winter flowers, now presented the desolate appearance of tender vegetation after a severe frost.
In some parts of the premises, scarcely a single plant retained a leaf or bud.
By the universal difi"u3ion of this gas through the houses, many of the severest sufierers were those farthest removed from the point of its ingress.
That the plants had been absorbing carburetted hydrogen for some time was evident from the fact, hitherto unaccountable to the gardener and ourselves, that they had been occasionally shedding buds and leaves.
Had there been no plants in the house, the peculiar odor of gas would doubtless have been perceptible for some days before the accident.
Its volume proved to be much greater than we at first supposed.
Those plants placed upon or near the floor, or upon the lower tiers of staging, sufiered less than the taller specimens, or than such as were near the upper sash.
This was especially the case with the Camellias, and other hardwooded plants.
The full extent of the damage was not apparent at first.
Many plants maintained their fresh greenness without b'^coming shrivelled, or withering ; yet although seemingly in fine health, they shed every leaf at the slightest touch.
Syringing was resorted to with the hope that the absorption of water might, in some degree, counteract, or neutralize the noxious effects of the gas ; but in most instances, the leaves and buds fell off when treated with gentle streams of water from a finely perforated syringe.
As no plant sufi'ered unless in leaf at the time, it seems evident that the injury was eff"ected and sustained by absorption through the medium of the foliage alone.
The volume of gas was too small to be absorbed to any extent by the earth, or roots of the plants.
Bulbs, and other plants, dry and at rest, were distributed in considerable number through the houses, both upon the upper shelves and beneath the staging.
A row of grape vines (not in leaf) stood against the eastern wall within the greenhouse, growing in a prepared border of earth under the table.
The gaseous current passed directly through their roots.
Saturated as the ground seems to have been with fresh gas, which was strongly manifest on taking up a handful of the earth, they do not appear to have sustained any injury thereby.
A row of maple trees along the outer edge of the footwalk on Eighteenth street were also directly in the way of the current.
They were not more than eight feet from the leaking pipes.
Owing to the depth of frost it is probable that the flow of gas passed beneath their roots ; nevertheless the ground within a few feet was black with the " dead gas.''''
They sustained no apparent injury, * In order to convey as correct an idea as possible of the relative positions of theplaats v/ithin the houses, it may be proper to observe briefly that the greenhouse is one hundred feet iE length by twenty-five in breadth, runs north and south, and is substantially constructed of brick, with a span roof of sash.
The western side is also of glass from within tour feet of the ground.
The span commences about eight feet from the floor, with the apex about seventeen feet in height.
Included within the same range is the hot house, separated from the greenhouse by a sash partition, and communicating by two sash doors At the extreme end, farthest from the leak, a small orchid house opens into the hot-house, 1858.]
120 put forth their leaves in the spring, and grew through the season with their usual vigor.
As a general rule the hardwooded plants fared the worst.
Succulents were the first to wither, and the first to recover.
Large numbers of both hard and softwooded lost their tender twigs and young wood, which withered and required pruning as far back as the sound growth.
While some showed signs of life, and began to put forth leaves within a few weeks, others lingered for months ; some died after a sickly existence, and many were killed outright.
Some plants near the leak, and under the full influence of the gas, manifested no apparent injury ; others in the remote orchid house were violently afiected, exhibiting an astonishing sensibility.
It seems rather anomalous, that of the Orchidacese, whose sustenance is derived mainly from the atmosphere, every individual should have exhibited a total indiflerence to the gaseous influence.
Several large specimens of Bletia Tankervillicea, as well as plants of Cypripedium venustum, and insigne, passed unscathed through the heat of the battle.
That plants in general are peculiarly sensitive to this gas, even when it is almost consumed by combustion, seems to be well established.
The experience of florists who supply blooming plants at entertainments, is, that the plants having been thus exposed are often in a sickly condition for some time thereafter.
This is especially the case with Camellias.
They frequently shed their foliage, and have been known to die after an exposure of a few hours in rooms where many gas lights were burning.
This has no doubt been caused in part by the heated and impure air arising from crowded assemblages, but, if so, similar effects would be alike apparent in Horticultural exhibitions when open only by daylight.
No experiment similar to that which we are about to record has ever, to our knowledge, taken place upon so great a scale, or included within its range so large a number of genera.
Solitary instances have been occasionally noted in which a limited number of species have been brought within the influence of acid and inflammable gases.
Examples are not wanting, indeed, to confirm the destructive effects of carburetted hydrogen on vegetable organism.
Many of the fine old elms in the streets of New Haven have been killed by leaks from the neighboring main gas pipes.
Similar effects have been observed in Boston, Albany, and other cities in the United States.
In a review of a paper entitled " Ueber Gasfabrikation und Gasheleuchtwig com sanitdtspolizeilichen StandpunJcte ; von Dr. Innhauser.
( Wien.
Wochenhl.
35, 1856,)" the author quotes the observation of M. Ulex, of Hamburg, as follows : In this city there are a great many linden and elm trees.
In 1851, one hundred and fifty-nine of these trees had to be cut down because they had died.
It was found that the bark immediately above the ground, often as far up as eight to ten feet, was quite loose, and completely separated from the wood ; the roots soft and red, the fibres of the roots soft and rotten.
The interior of the trees were perfectly sound.
This injurious effect upon the trees is not only caused by the gas which escapes unburnt in the flame, but more particularly by that gas which leaks through the pipes in the ground.
It was sometimes perceived at a distance of fifteen to twenty-five paces from the pipes.
The same observations were made in Paris, Bordeaux, Diisseldorf, Mannheim, Basle, and Vienna.
Professor Bertulus, of Marseilles, thinks that the combinations of sulphur and ammonia in the gas saturated the ground with hydrosulphate of ammonium, which also causes the black color of the soil.

* Although not strictly within the range of the subject at present under consideration, it may not be out of place to remark that many instances are on record which show that vegetation has been seriously injured by acid gases from manufactories, especially in Belgium and Prussia.
The same causes are said to have produced similar effects in a modified form in the vicinity of Philadelphia.
This may account for the unusual mortality among the Liriodendron ttdipifera, and other indigenous forest trees, killed front 8ime to time in Fenn Square, in the neighborhood of the United States Mint.
[May, 121 In reviewing these simple facts several questions naturally arise which, possess more than ordinary interest for the vegetable physiologist, and may lead one step towards eliciting new developments in the chemical organization of plants.
Although no narrow nor definite limits can be drawn, still, the general characteristics tend to prove that a sympathy does often exist between genera of the same natural order.
In glancing over the following memoranda of the effects of carburetted hydrogen gas upon each genus, this sympathy is frequently apparent throughout the various members of a family.
* Without venturing on further comment or attempting more than a brief outline, these facts are presented with the hope that the attention of chemists in their experiments upon vegetable organism may be directed towards further researches.
It may be well enough to remark that the enumeration of the species under each genus was not deemed necessary.
Wherever they were differently affected they have been so specified.
The natural classification of Lindley's Vegetable Kingdom has been adopted in the arrangement which follows, and the remarks are as much condensed as practicable.
In the Transactions of the Society for the encouragement of Industry in Prussia, (1857) is published an interesting extract from a report by Prof. Dr. E. L. Schubarth, of Berlin, to the Belgian government, " on the acid gases which escape from the manufactories of sulphuric acid and of soda, and the means to render them innoxious."
It seems that " numerous complaints of the farmers that the vapors from the chemical manufactories in Belgium injured the vegetation of the fields and gardens, induced the government (of Belgium,) to appoint a commission to examine this matter.
This commission consisted of chemists, botanists and farmers.
During the summer of 1855, the excitement among the people, who even ascribed the potato-rot to the influence of the chemical factories, had so much increased that several attacks were made upon the factories.
The government, therefore, increased the number of the commissioners, and at the end of the year, they made a report which was published under the title " Fabriques de produits Rapport a M. le ministre dei'lnterieure par la commission d'enquetre, Bruxelles, 1856."
They say it was an admitted fact that vegetation is injured by the acid gases from chemical works, but this influence is often overrated ; the spots on the leaves, and injuries of the flowers ascribed to acid gases, are very frequently the result of other causes, as frost, microscopic, vegetable, and animal parasites, deposits of foreign matter upon the leaves, very intense sunlight, etc.
The potato-rot is certainly neither caused nor increased by these gases.
On the other hand, chemical investigations proved the presence of traces of hydrochloric acid in spotted leaves, and in the dew upon the plants.
Similar spots could be artificially made by moistening the leaves with dilute hydrochloric acid, the presence of which could be proved after an interval of eight days.
The report contains a list of trees injured by these gases ^ * Several chemists of high reputation have made examinations of the gas of the Philadelphia Gas Works, but, from some cause, their results are at variance.
In order to facilitate the further researches of such as may desire to investigate its effects on vegetable organism, I insert the analysis of Dr. C, M. Wetherill, made in 1852, for the'engineer ot the Philadelphia Gas Works, This is probably as nearly correct as can at present be determined.

They vegetated as usual in the spring, and grew vigorously through the season.
The depth of frozen earth enveloping their roots, caused the gas to flow beneath, without doing them any injury.

Camellia.
These were in the full glory of bloom.
About one hundred and twenty varieties were distributed through the green-house, embracing many large old plants upon the upper staging.
In a day or two after the entrance of the gas, not a leaf, bud, flower, or wood-bud remained upon the largest and finest plants.
The leaves did not shrivel, nor did they change color.
At the slightest touch they fell off in showers.
Those nearest the roof suffered most severely.
A plant, which to an observer would seem to be in healthful vigor, would lose every vestige of greenness in a moment, upon being slightly shaken, and appear like a naked dead shrub.
They had to be cut back extensively, some to the main stem, but the largest and noblest specimens were too much injured ever to put forth again.
Others vegetated feebly, and revived slowly.
The nurture of years will be requisite to restore them to their former condition and appearance.

ViTis.
A row of foreign grape vines, planted in a prepared border inside of the green-house, and trained up the wall and along the rafters, were not in leaf at the time.
The gas passed directly through their masses of fibrous roots.
On stooping down, the strong odor of gas was encountered for some distance.
This was more apparent on taking up handfuls of the fresh earth, which was unmistakably foetid.
Notwithstanding these facts, the vines vegetated early in the Spring, and grew vigorously, although they bore no fruit.
As their roots lay directly within the gaseous influence, it is reasonable to attribute their preservation to their state of inaction at that time.

Twenty-nine members present.
Mr.
Slack exhibited two living specimens of Argulus cato&tomi, and stated that this animal had been described at length by Messrs. Dana and Herrick in [June^ 135 the 31st volume of Silliman's Journal.
They, however, had found it only in brackish water, and upon the operculas or gill covers.
These had been found in a creek at least fifty miles from salt water, and upon the gills themselves, which were highly congested, apparently from the attacks of these animals.

Thirty-three members present.
Mr. Lea exhibited a specimen of Unio ruhiginosiis Lea, and remarked that, at a late meeting, he had called the attention of the Academy to a specimen of Unio muUiplicatus Lea, which had both leaves of the branchise on both sides charged with j'-oung shells, which he then supposed to be peculiar to that species.
Within a few days he had received from Cincinnati a number of species in a living state ; and he was surprised to find, in a fine female rubiginosus^ which he exhibited to the Academy, both leaves on both sides fully charged, the whole width, with sacks of ova of a deep rose color.
These were not matured into the perfect shell, but each ovum was filled with red granulations, which gave a clear red tint to the whole of the four masses.
On making an incision into the abdominal mass, he found the ovary fully charged with red eggs, which, passing out of the cut made by the scalpel, gave the appearance of arterial blood.
The mass of the soft parts of this species is usually salmon-color or orange, but it is sometimes white, and this female was of the latter color.

Notes to a second edition of a Geological Map of Nebraska and Kansas, by F. V. Hayden, M. D. ^ A letter from Mr. Edward Harris was read, containing the following statements regarding specimens of Salmo Gloverii Girard, presented this evening : 1858.]
136 In the first place I would remark, that Mr. Girard's description of the color of the belly (yellowish) has doubtless arisen from his description being taken from the specimen as preserved in spirits, as it accorded with the coloring of my fish, which had been only two weeks in spirits ; whereas, when put in.
they were bright silvery below the medial line and over the belly, as is the case with all the fish taken at the outlet of the Grand Lake, on the western branch of the St. Croix River, as I also found them many years since on this stream as well as the eastern branch, in the fall of the year.
These fish are taken also in moderate quantities lower down the stream, but in the waters below Lewey's Island, which are of a darker color, and constantly filled with sawdust from the mills, the fish lose their silvery brightness and have the appearance of having been immersed in a yellowish dye ; these fish, too, are always in poor condition.
In the young state, say from six to eight inches in length, they have almost invariably an irregular row of bright red spots placed along the medial line, some on one side, and some on the other.
It was considered a very remarkable circumstance by the fishermen on the spot, that a fish so large as the smaller of these two should have the red spots, which this one had very distinctly before it was put in the spirits.
It has been heretofore considered by those who were acquainted with this fish, that they were entirely confined to the waters of the St. Croix, including its two branches and their lakes, in fact confined almost entirely to the lakes and their outlets; and it is only on this trip that I have heard of specimens having, been taken, as a rarity, in three small lakes which empty into the lower St. Croix, and into the Passamaquoddy Bay.
The fish described by Mr. Girard, as found in Union River,, would have but a short distance farther to travel in the salt water before entering that river.
It is therefore pretty certain that they are, as far as yet known, confined to the waters of the St. Croix and streams of easy access therefrom by sea.
They appear not to be known in New Brunswick, except in one of the small lakes alluded to, which empties its waters on that side of the river Mr. Perley is said to be unacquainted with the fish, except from report.
I will mention another fact in regard to the Union River, which may throw some light on the history of this fish.
I met accidently at Bangor with a gentleman of that place, an ardent sportsman, who told me he had caught in a small lake tributary to that river, a small .salmon ; that the waters of this lake had been dammed for saw mills about thirty years ago, shutting off as he supposed, the return of some salmon which had entered it for the purpose of spawning, and, that they had continue^ to breed there since, and had from want of access to the sea, deteriorated in size, and said also that several had been taken since.
Now this gentleman had never seen the salmon trout (its universal name there,) of the St. Croix.
Now taking into consideration that Agassiz has pronounced this fish the true Salmo Salar.
which has at some former time, by some convulsion of nature, been shut up in these St. Croix Lakes, and only had the access to salt water restored by another geological change after the fish had been bred there so long as to lose its habits of migration, we need not be surprised that this gentleman should take this fish to be a small salmon.
These fish, as taken, may be said to run from, one to five pounds in weight, as it is very rare to take fish of a size intermediate between the small fish with the red spots and those of the size of these specimens.
I regret that I did not procure the small fish.
I took a number of them at Lewey's Island, but could procure no spirits to preserve them, and after returning from Calais, I could catch none of the fish.
As a game fish, affording fine sport to the fly fisher, I doubt whether it has its equal on this continent, with the exception of the true salmon.
Its strength and agility are surprising ; when hooked it will frequently make a succession of leaps of two and three feet clear of the water.
It is most readily taken with the fly in the most rapid waters above the dam at the foot of the Grand Lake, which has been made for the purpose of running logs.
They are readily taken [June, 137 while the gates are up, but as soon as they are closed and the water becomes still, they decline the fly, but will still take the bait ; at this time it is necessary to fish below the dam, where there is still a very rapid current from leakage and overflow.
The brook trout, S. fontinalis, is taken in the same waters, and in the stiller waters above, a large lake trout, there called the Togue, which differs from the Salmo confinis of the northern lakes, by having a more deeply forked tail like the -S^.
siskewei of Lake Superior.
Another striking characteristic in the history of this fish, is the remarkable development, in the male, of the point of the lower jaw, or chin, whereby it becomes elongated and hooked, during and previous to the seasons of sexual connexion and spawning, which are simultaneous in fishes.
This peculiarity, which, so far as I am aware, has been heretofore considered to belong to the type of the genus alone, the Salmo salar, adds much force to the theory of Mr. Agassiz to which I alluded before, (and I believe I am correctly informed that he has advanced such a theory).
This fact, which I can vouch for from personal observation as well as other undeniable testimony, will show the necessity of a very close and searching examination of the structure and anatomy of this fish, comparing it with the true salmon, before its new name is confirmed.
This sexual development, so strictly analogous to the swelling of the neck in the genus Cervus among quadrupeds, seems to point to further research among other species of the genus, that is to say, whether there is nut a similar development, though less marked, through the whole family, as at present arranged, or if found wanting in that portion of the genus with very minute scales, whether it may not characterise that portion consisting of Salmo salar, this fish and all those having large scales.
I was struck the other day in looking over the figures of Richardson's Troat of the Arctic Regions, that there was more than one with the projecting lower jaw.
Were not these fish taken during the spawning season?
And may they not have received another name in the normal state ?
Of course the facts at present known are too scanty to found a theory upon, but should this suggestion ultimately prove to have a foundation in fact, it would be sufficient to authorise a division of the genus.
Dr. Morris mentioned in connection with this subject, that he had observed in the common brook trout {Salmo fontinalis) a similar elongation of the lower jaw in the spawning season.

BY F. T. HAYDENj M. D. Geologist to the Expedition.
/ In May of 1857, by permission of the War Department, I prepared and read before the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia, a few brief notes on the geological structure of the vast region drained by the Missouri River, with, a section showing the different formations from Fort Benton to the mouth, of the Platte.
The geology, as far as it was known at that time, was represented by colors, on a topographical map constructed by Lieut.
Warren.
Since that time the expedition to the Black Hills under his command, has brought back many additional facts and much new material, which render a second edition of the map necessary, and enables me not only to add some geological formations, not previously known to exist in the West, but to enlarge to a considerable extent the boundaries of others.
In my notes explanatory of the geological portion of the map, I shall endeavor, as far as possible, to avoid the repetition of material already made known, through numerous publications, in connection with Mr. Meek.
A much larger surface might have been colored on the map with a good degree of confidence, but I have preferred to confine myself, for the most part, to the results of my own observations in the field, leaving the blank portions to be filled up by future explorations.
The rocks of Nebraska, as far as they are at present known, are referrible to the following geological systems : I. Metamorphosed azoic rocks, including clear granite.
II.
Lower Silurian.
(Potsdam standstone.)
III.
Devonian?
IV.
Carboniferous.
V. Permian.
VI.
Jurassic.
VII.

140) I. Granitic and Metamoephosed Azoic Rocks.
.
From the month of the Platte to Fort Laramie we meet with no indications of those disturbing influences from the subterranean forces which have wrought such changes in the physical features of the country in the vicinity of the mountain chains.
But proceeding north and west from Fort Laramie, we soon find the different formations, older than the Tertiary, distorted and dipping at various angles.
We observe, at first, a series of elevations in the form of isolated conical hills with rounded summits, varying from fifty to two hundred feet in height, for the most part, capped with Carboniferous limestones, which incline at various angles from 5*^ to 30Â°.
Toward the main axis we find the elevations in the form of oblong ridges, frequently interrupted by narrow valleys, and presenting a full series of the formations known in this region, from the granite to the carboniferous limestones.
Winding around these conical peaks and ridges are numerous streams of pure water, margined with birches, poplars, and other trees, of the same species as those found in far northern latitudes.
Not unfrequently the valleys formed by these streams are of considerable width, with a soil composed of the debris of the granitic and metamorphic rocks which sustains a quite luxuriant growth of vegetation.
Laramie Peak,* the highest elevation in the Laramie range of mountains, is composed mainly of a coarse red feldspathic granite, surrounded by a series of azoic strata composed of gneiss, hornblende, micaceous and clay slates and quartz more or less pure, standing vertical, and inclining against the older granitic rocks.
Raw Hide Peak, which is alsout 1,000 feet high, is also composed principally of granite which has been protruded upward through the overlying rocks, while all around the base of the peak, in regular sequence outward, may be seen the different azoic strata in a nearly or quite vertical position.
Proceeding northward from Fort Laramie, the granitic and metamorphosed rocks cease to appear after passing the head of the Niobrara river, and from thence to the Black Hills we observe only slight local disturbances, sufiicient to expose the Cretaceous beds down to No.
1, but showing most conclusively that the same subterranean forces that elevated the Laramie Mountains, raised the Black Hills also.
Arriving at the base of the Black Hills, we ascend by a series of stair-like ridges to the central or highest portion, and find that it is composed of a similar coarse red feldspathic granite as a nucleus, with a series of azoic strata resting against the granite.
At the foot of the Black Hlls, Cretaceous bed No.
5 is but slightly disturbed ; dipping, perhaps, at an angle of 5Â°, and forming the first of a series of upheaved ridges which surround the principal axis.
Passing over the first ridge we descend somewhat abruptly into a valley, and gradually ascend a second ridge, composed of Cretaceous beds Nos.
5 and 4, from eighty to one hundred feet in height, inclining at a still greater angle.
The third ridge is formed of Nos.
4 and 3, and so on through all the different formations to the Potsdam sandstone, which is sometimes nearly vertical, and at others so elevated as to hold a nearly horizontal position.
The granite of the Black Hills contains much more mica than that forming the nucleus of the Laramie Mountains, and might perhaps be more properly called a micaceous granite.
The Black Hills furnish the only examples on our route of the outburst of trappean rocks.
Stone Peak, on the north eastern side of the Black Hills, is an isolated protrusion, composed of every variety, from a most cellular or vesicular porphyritic lava, to a rather compact rock, which sounds under a blow of a hammer like clink-stone.
The highest portion of the peak is composed of trap rock of greater age than that above described, very compact, contains much iron, and assumes the form of pentagonal columns very similar to those described in Dr. Owen's report as occurring around Lake Superior.
Near Bear * Elevation unknown.
[June, 141 Peak, on the north-eastern side of the Black Hills, is another example of the protrusion of these basaltic columns which are also five-sided, the sides varying from eight to twenty inches in width.
Some of the columns lie in a nearly horizontal position, the greater portion, however, inclining at an angle of 20^ to 40*^.
Bear Peak is an outburst of porphyritic trappean rocks, specimens of which closely resemble the Tertiary lavas of the Pacific coast.
All the Cretaceous beds and all the Jurassic to the blue limestone E of vertical section* are upheaved around Bear Peak.
From the foregoing examinations I am led to the conclusion, that the main body of the Black Hills and the Laramie range is composed of granite of very ancient date.
That it is older than the oldest fossiliferous rooks is obvious from the fact that in both localities several hundred feet of stratified azoic rocks are interposed between it and the Potsdam sandstone.
I am also of the opinion that the azoic strata overlying the granite on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains are similar in lithological characters, and hold the same geological position as the azoic rocks so largely developed around Lake Superior and in Canada.
n. Lower Silueian Rocks â Potsdam Sandstone.
The evidence of the existence of this formation in the region of the Rocky Mountains was ascertained, for the first time, in the summer of 1857, during Lt. Warren's Exploration of the Black Hills, as has already been shown in a paper read before the Acad.
Nat.
Sci., in March 1858.
Its largest developement and only fossiliferous condition is found in the Black Hills, where by upheaval it is exposed in the form of a narrow belt or zone engirdling the azoic and granitic rocks which form the central axis of elevation.
I observed no positive indications of this formation in the Laramie Mountains or at Raw Hide Peak, but in most places the Carboniferous strata rested unconformably upon the metamorphic rocks, except in a few localities, where a quartzose limestone which may be of Devonian ?
age was interposed.
But at the head of the Niobrara river, a series of horizontal beds were exposed, resting upon the vertical edges of the metamorphosed rocks, which from their lithological characters I have considered as belonging to the Potsdam sandstone.
The following section will show the descending order of the beds.
c. â A yellow and reddish yellow, heavy bedded, friable sandstone, composed of an aggregation of quartz grains, cemented by calcareous matter, sometimes becoming a conglomerate, consisting of rounded quartz pebbles, .......... 22 feet.
h. â Fine compact, reddish clay slate, 5 feet.
a.
â Very nearly like bed c, only more compact and heavy bedded, of a light gray color, sometimes yellow with a reddish tinge, .
.
37 feet A series of metamorphic vertical strata, consisting of gneiss with silvery mica in large plates, micaceous and talcose slates, white quartz, &c. Proceeding on our route northward, this formation was not again seen untii we arrived at the main axis of elevation of the Black Hills.
Near our camp, of September 24th, on the southeastern side, I observed resting unconformably upon gneiss, hornblende, mica slate, &c., a variegated, gray and reddish gray quartzose sandstone filled with small plates of mica.
Some parts of it were compact and silicious, others a coarse friable grit, and at this locality seldoiri becoming a conglomerate, but containing seams almost entirely composed of comminuted fragments of shells, cemented with a fine grit.
The more compact masses contained some fossils that were quite well preserved, among which were species of Lingula, Oholus and Trilobites, similar to, or identical with, those found in the Potsdam sandstone in other well known localities.
* See vertical section of rocks in the Black Hills, in a paper by F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci., March, 1858.
1858.]
The following section at this point may serve to render more clear the order of succession of the beds.
c. â Yellow magnesian limestone, ...... 50 feet.
h. â Yellowish gray arenaceus limestone, ..... 40 feet.
a, â Potsdam sandstone, as described, .
.
.
.
30 to 50 feet.
Azoic rocks standing vertical.
Beds h and c are Carboniferous and conformable to bed a.
We continue to see this formation whenever we approach the central portion of the Black Hills, and in some localities the greater part assumes the character of a coarse conglomerate composed of worn fragments from all the varieties of rocks beneath.
Sometimes the lines of lamination are very irregular, as if the materials had been deposited by ocean currents.
I observed this bed on the northeastern side of the Black Hills near Bear Peak, dipping at an angle of 20Â° to 30*^.
Inasmuch as we have no paleontological evidence of the existence of this formation in the Rocky Mountain range, we must depend upon the somewhat uncertain data of lithological resemblance and position, for its geographical distribution.
Prof. Hall, in Stansbury's Report, often describes a bed of sandstone corresponding in its lithological characters and geological position to the Potsdam sandstone in the Black Hills.
Stansbury's Island, (Grreat Salt Lake) the summit of which is three thousand feet in height, is capped with carboniferous limestone, which also rests upon a coarse sandstone and conglomerate.
Again, north of Great Salt Lake City, the "limestone overlies a coarse sandstone or conglomerate, which almost invariably accompanies it."
"In several localities, as at Promontory Point, and near Mud Island, the metamorphic strata appear to be overlaid by a coarse conglomerate or coarse sandstone, which is partially altered and assumes the character of a quartz rock. '
' Marcou, in the third volume of Pacific R. R. Reports, page 156, speaks of a sandstone occurring near the Aztec Mountains.
He says : ' ' We travelled seven miles upon the granite, and on our right we found a cliff twelve hundred feet high.
From the base to the middle we found the granite, then a band of red sandstone, (Devonian or Old Red.)
Above this, the beds of limestone and gray sandstone, belonging to the mountain limestone."
The following day "we travelled three miles on the granite, the remainder on the Old Red Sandstone."
The diagram given, showing the order of the superposition of the different rocks, would apply equally well to the similar beds in the Black Hills.
Many other less evident indications along the base of the Rocky Mountains might be cited from published Reports, but what has been said will be sufB.cient to show what we may hereafter expect with regard to its geographical distribution in the far west.
III.
Devonian?
Formation.
The evidence of the existence of the Devonian formation near the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, is, as yet, quite obscure.
Owing to the metamorphosed condition of the rocks, the fossils have been wholly obliterated, or only indistinct traces of them remain.
About twelve miles west of Fort Laramie, the Platte river cuts through a series of strata three to four hundred feet in thickness, resting unconformably upon metamorphosed azoic rocks.
The upper members of the series contain undoubted carboniferous fossils, which are sufficient to fix, with a good degree of precision, their age ; but resting upon the azoic rocks, is a very hard, compact quartzose limestone, evidently metamorphosed to some extent, which, from its position and lithological character, I am disposed to refer to Devonian, though it maybe of Silurian age.
On the Platte river, it holds a horizontal position for the most part, but in a few localities the underlying azoic rocks are thrust up through it, distorting it at every angle.
About ten miles north of Fort Laramie, near Raw Hide Peak, it is again exposed, the strata being vertical, alternating with soft, dark, blue clay slate.
I did not see any indications of it in the vicinity of Laramie Peak, or in the Black Hills.
[June, 143 In regard to tlie geographical distribution of the formation, very little can be said.
Mr. Englemann, geologist to Lieut.
Bryan's Expedition to the South Pass, often mentions a similar rock occurring at various localities between Fort Laramie and the South Pass.
* Dr. Shumard, after an examination of some specimens placed in his hands by Mr. E., says : " The specimens from the metamorphosed silicious strata, on the north side of Medicine Bow Butte, are Paleozoic types, belonging to the genera Spirifer, Chonetrs, Orthis, Orthoceras, Conocardium, &c. They were very badly preserved, and their specific characters almost wholly obliterated.
From their general appearance, however, I am strongly of the opinion that they represent the Devonian period, ' ' The evidence of its existence in the vicinity of Fort Laramie and other localities is so slight, that I have thought it not prudent to color any portion of the map as Devonian.
IV.
Carboniferous System.
This system, as it is developed in the region of Fort Laramie, has been discussed so fully by Mr. Meek, and the writer in our paper published in March last, that I need only refer to it in a very brief manner.
The town of Desoto is the highest point known on the Missouri where these limestones are exposed.
Ascending the valley of the Platte river, we find them quite well developed as far as the mouth of the Elkhorn, when they pass beneath the bed of the river, and the sandstone No.
1 occupies the country.
Several small seams of coal have been found in these limestones at Belle vue and other localities ; and in the valley of the Platte, about ten miles above its mouth, I noticed a bed of very dark carbonaceous shale two feet in thickness, cropping out near the water's edge.
This was considered by the inhabitants as a sufficient proof of the existence of a workable bed of coal in the vicinity.
The evidence now points to the conclusion, that, though these limestones belong to the true coal measures, they hold a position above the workable beds of coal, and that it is not probable a valuable seam of coal will be found north of the southern line of Nebraska.
A bed of coal, of inferior quality, has been wrought near Leavenworth City, Kansas Territory, but it holds a lower geological position than the limestones of the southern portion of Nebraska, the dip of the strata being toward the northwest.
The exact position in the Carboniferous system, to which the limestones around Fort Laramie and in the Black Hills belong, is not sufficiently clear from the evidence yet obtained.
They do not seem to be the equivalents of the beds above described along the Missouri, though they may be.
The texture of the rock is quite unlike that of any of the limestones of the coal measures with which we are acquainted, and there seems to be an absence of the fossils characteristic of the coal measure limestones on the Missouri, and in northeastern Kansas.
The latest opinion, however, of my associate, Mr. Meek, is, that they belong to the true coal measures.
The following sections may serve to show the relations of the limestones at Port Laramie with those in the Black Hills.
d. â Vertical section of carboniferous rocks near Fort Laramie.
Yellow magnesian limestone, hard and rather granular in its structure ; contains several species Rhynconella, 50 feet.
c. â ^Very compact bluish gray limestone, with a deeply sinuate Productus, and a Productus like P. cora in the fineness of its strise, .
.
20 feet.
h. â Rather friable, flesh colored, arenaceous limestone, with an abundance of a smooth Terebratula, like T. subtileta, 4 feet.
<^ â  â Yellowish and whitish arenaceous limestone, containing Spirifer, Rocky montani, (Marcou) allied to Lower Carboniferous forms ; a second species very much like, perhaps identical with, S, cameratus ; a third, with a high aj-ea like S. cuspidatus ; also a species of Productus very closely allied to P. semirettculatus, 30 to 40 feet.

144 Vertical section of Carboniferous rocks in the Blade Hills.
2.
â Yellow magnesian limestone, rather hard and compact, passing down into a somewhat friable arenaceous limestone, underlaid by a bluish limestone, very hard, and containing a Productus like P. cora, and a Rhynconella.
1.
â Yellowish gray arenaceous limestone, with a reddish tinge, splitting into thin slabs parallel with the lines of stratification ; containing a Spirifer, perhaps identical with S. cameratus ; a Productus like P. cora ; corals, a Zaphrentis, Syringopora, &c. In the middle of this bed there is an eight foot layer of very hard compact bluish limestone, filled with comminuted crinoidal remains.
The lower portion of bed (1) is the same as bed a of the Laramie section, and contains fossils at both localities which are similar to Lower Carboniferous types, along with some well marked Carboniferous species.
In the Black Hills it contains a species of Euomphalus, resembling a species common in the Encrinital or Burlington limestone of the Lower Carboniferous series of the Western States, but perhaps distinct.
Bed 2 includes beds a and 6, of the Laramie section, bed c being absent iji the Black Hills section.
From the geological position, texture of the rocks, similarity, and in some cases identity of species of fossils, I think it quite certain that the limestones at Fort Laramie and in the Black Hills are the same as those so well developed in the vicinity of Salt Lake, in Utah Territory.
V. Permian Rocks.
Although but a short period has elapsed since, through the collections of Maj. Hawn, the evidence of the existence of this system of rocks in the West has been given to the world, it has already been shown to occur over a wide geographical area.
In addition to Maj. Hawn's discoveries in northeastern Kanzas, which were announced in February last, and the paper published March 2d, by Mr. Meek and the writer, Dr. Shumard stated, at a Meeting of the Academy of Natural Sciences, at St. Louis, March 8th, that he had been studying a group of fossils from a white limestone in the Guadalupe Mountains, of New Mexico, and arrived at the conclusion that they were of Permian age.
He also says, that several of the species are identical with Permian forms from England and Russia; also identical with species obtained from the Permian rocks in Kanzas.
It is now known to occur in a number of localities in the central portions of Kanzas also along the Missouri River and opposite the northern boundary of the State of Missouri, and the evidence is quite conclusive, that it is developed in the Black Hills.
Many stray masses of compact silicious rock were found in and around the Black Hills, containing fossils identical with those described from Kanzas.
This question has already been discussed in a former paper, and I have considered the two beds E and F of the Section as Permian, with a query, the evidence not being sufficient to establish its existence with certainty.
In a letter to the Academy of Sciences at St. Louis, dated March 31st, Dr. Norwood announced the discovery of Permian fossils in Illinois, and at the Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at Baltimore, Mr. A. H. Worthen, State Geologist of Illinois, read a paper on the Permian rocks of that State, and exhibited a fine collection of fossils, which he considered as belonging to that system.
We have, therefore, reliable evidence of the existence of these rocks in Kanzas, Nebraska, New Mexico and Illinois, and future investigations will, I think, prove them well developed in Missouri and other Western States.f * I have endeavored to represent this formation on the map, in Kansas, from information derived from Major Hawn's explorations.
fin our remarks of the 2d of March, upon the discovery of supposed Permian rocks in the West, both Mr. Meek and myself wish to be understood as referring to their existence in Kanzas and Nebraska.
Our object being simply to announce our conclusions derived from the study of fossils col[JBBC; 145 lected from these rocks in the West, we did not refer to their supposed prior discovery in Pennsylvania and on the Atlantic coast, nor were we able to judge of the evidence of their existence in those localities, it being based, for the most part, upon the remains of Vertebrata, which are out of our line of investigation.
We also merely wished to announce the existence in the West of rocks which were on a parallel with the so-called Permian system of Europe.
; without touching the great question whether or not there is actually a Permiar: system distinct from the Carboniferous.
VI.
Jurassic System.
The Black Hills has, up to this time, afforded the most satisfactory evidence of the existence of this system in the West.
It is there brought to the surface by the upheaval of the older rocks in the form of a belt or zone, five to fifteen miles in width, engirdling the principal axis of elevation.
None of the organic remains already discovered, which are quite numerous in species, are known to be positively identical with those found in the same system in the old world, but they belong to the same genera, and many of the species are so closely allied to forms characteristic of the Jura of Europe, that we cannot now hesitate to admit this system into our series.
I will here repeat the palaeontological evidence, which was read before the Academy in March last by Mr, Meek and myself, with such additional proof as we have been able to secure by our investigation of the undescribed fossils in the collection, up to the present time.

We have, also, in the collection from the Black Hills, a species of Hettangia, a genus not known to occur in the old world in formations newer than the Lias, and a Trigonia more nearly resembling Jurassic types than those of any other formation.
Although it is not yet known to occupy a large geographical area in this country, we have indications that it will be found extensively developed ou.
the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, from the northern part of British America to New Mexico.
That it exists toward the head waters of the.
Yellow Stone, around Panther and Big Horn Mountains, I cannot doubt.
In the summer of 1854, while exploring the valley of the Yellowstone, a^far as the mouth of the Big Horn River, 1 received, from intelligent traders, masses of gypsum precisely like that characterizing the Jurassic beds in the Black Hills.
VII.
Cretaceous System,* â Upper, Middle and Lower (including the Wbaldbn ?)
The beds of sandstone impure lignite, &c., which we have hitherto dpscribed as resting upon the Upper Carboniferous limestones, near Council *In a paper recently published by Maj. F. Hawn, in the St. Louis Acad.
Sci , I observe he refers the whole of formation INo.
1 of the Nebraska section to the Trias; and alludes to the fact that Mr. Meek and I had referred it to the Lower Cretaceous.
He also states, that he found in some of the lower beds included by us in this series in Kanzas, fosssif indicating relations rather to the Permian below than the Cretaceous above.
In justice to Mr. Meek and myself, I would state, that these lower beds in Kanza?
1848.J 11 146 Bluflfs, and extending above the mouth of the Big Sioux River, have, until recently, been considered of doubtful geological age, on account of the paucity of their organic remains.
The discovery, during the past year, at Blackbird Hills, of dicotyledonous leaves in this formation, allied to the oaks, willows, and others of our deciduous forest trees, together with their position with regard to other well-known Cretaceous formations, renders the evidence quite clear that a large portion of the strata which we have included in No.
1 of our vertical section, are of Lower Cretaceous age.
"^" In ascending the Platte Valley, No.
1 is first observed five miles above the mouth of that river in the form of an outlier, resting upon the Carboniferous limestone and gradually increasing in thickness to the mouth of the Elkhorn; it then covers the surface of the country as far as Beaver Creek, a branch of Loup Fork.
We have already mentioned its exposure by elevation in the valley of Old Woman's Creek; and it also forms a belt around the Black Hills, presenting its usually variable lithological characters, and for the most part destitute of fossils.
No.
2, 3, 4 and 5 also occur in their order of sequence outward from the Black Hills, as is shown by colors on the map.
We have therefore arrived at the conclusion, that No.
1, as it is revealed from Council BlufFs to the Big Sioux, is Lower Cretaceous ; although two or three beds of yellow and ash-colored clays, exposed at low water, near Blackbird Hills, may be Upper Jurassic, no organic remains having been found in them to fix with certainty their age.
We also consider a large portion of No.
1 ?, as seen at the mouth of the Judith, Lower Cretaceous, though some of the beds are probably Jurassic.
Should the Jurassic system be found to exist in the Judith country, of which fact there is room for very little doubt, we may look for a large development of it in the Great Lignite basin, which stretches northward toward the Arctic Sea.
The discovery during the past year in the Black Hills, of beds containing fresh water fossils of the genera Unio, Planorbis, Paludina, &c., in the lower portion of Cretaceous formation No.
1, or the upper part of the Jurassic, points to the conclusion that there probably are deposits in the West equivalent to those of the Wealden of Europe.
The existence of this formation in the West, was first suggested by Dr. Leidy after an examination of some Saurian rem ains discovered by me near the mouth of the Judith river, in the summer of 1855.
At that time the evidence seemed to be conflicting in its character, the Mollusc ous fossils appearing more closely allied to Tertiary forms, while the Verteb rate remains were related to those of the Wealden periods.
The fact that several species of shells from the Estuary beds of the Judith were included in No.
1 by us, solely on the strength of information furnished by Maj. Hawn, who had informed us that he had found in these beds, or rather in still lower beds.
Ammonites^, Baculites, Ancylocercs, Copiinella, Inoceramus, ^c, an association of fossils never met with in older rocks than the lowest Cretaceous.
The fossils, however, sent us from these lowest beds by Maj. Hawn, proved, on examination, to belong to quite distinct genera from those to which he had referred them ; being all Peimian and Carboniferous types.
Unfortunately, they did not come to hand until after our paper was published.
That the higher beds constituting the type of our No.
1, as seen near the mouth of the Big Sioux, on the Missouri, containing numerous well-preserved leaves of unquestionable dicotyledonous trees, apparently belonging to the genera Quercvs, Salix, &c., and closely resembling existing species of those genera, cannot be Triassic, or even Jurassic, will, of course, be understood by geologists.
Although we have as yet no conclusive, palseontological evidence that any portion of the beds we have provisfionally included in No.
1, in the region of the Judith River is Jurassic, still I am inclined to think that some of the beds of this system are there exposed by upheaval in several localities.
While exploring this wild, rugged country in the summer of 1855, 1 often noticed a series of nonfossihferous variegated beds of clays and grits, thrust up from beneath the fossiliferus sandstones, which we have called No.
1 ?, with the same lithological characters as the Jurassic strata, developed in the Black Hills.
I have httle doubt, that they are exposed around Little Rocky, Snowy and Girdle Mountains in the same manner as about the Black Hills.
*Maj. Hawn also found the same or similar leaves in this formation in Kansas.
[June, 147 were so closely related to forms occurring in the Great Lignite Basin, which we knew to be Tertiary beyond a doubt, that there was a question whether they were not specifically identical ; also that a species of Ostrea found in the upper Judith beds could not be distinguished from a species observed in the lowest bed of the Lignite Basin, and a species of Trionyx was considered by Dr. Leidy common to the two deposits, led both Mr. Meek and myself to express the opinion that the Judith beds were probably Tertiary, and were on a parallel with the lowest beds of the great Lignite Basin.
Other facts have now been brought to light which lead us rather to suspect that the suggestion first made by Dr. Leidy, that Judith River beds, or at any rate a portion of those containing the estuary fossils, as well as those occurring in the Black Hills, may be the American representatives of the Wealden of England.
On the map I have not distinguished the Wealden deposits by a separate color, but included them with Lower Cretaceous formation No.
1.
From the evidence thus far obtained in regard to the Laramie Mountains and the Black Hills, I have inferred that there have been the following oscillations of the surface of the country in this region.
In the first place, after the deposition of the azoic strata, there was an upheaval of the granitic rocks, which threw into a highly inclined position these older strata.
If this upheaval elevated the old azoic strata above the ocean level, there must have been a subsequent subsidence, after which the Potsdam Sandstone was deposited.
Then there was a later elevation that raised the Potsdam Sandstone above the surface of the ancient sea, which was followed by a long period of repose, sufficient for the deposition of all the formations from the Potsdam to the Upper Carboniferous, when there was another subsidence followed by the deposition of the formations of the Upper Carboniferous, Permian, (possibly the Triassic,) Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods.
After all these disturbances, and probably at the same time that most of our continent was raised above the ocean level, the whole of these strata were again elevated to nearly their present position previous to the dawn of the Tertiary period.
What changes may have occurred in the physical features of the country during the long period which must have elapsed between the deposition of the Lower Silurian and the Carboniferous rock, it is impoÂ»sible now to determine.
We know that in our present seas there is a constant deposition of sediment going on, forming sandstones, &c., or a calcareous precipitation forming limestones.
In order to account for the hiatus between the Potsdam sandstone and the Carboniferous rocks in this region, we must suppose that i^ither the surface occupied by the former was above the waters during this long interval, or that the intervening formations were deposited and subsequently removed by erosion and denudation, prior to the Carboniferous era.
It seems quite improbable that so great thickness of strata could have been removed, so as to leave no trace of their former existence over so large an areao.. We are, therefore, inclined to the opinion that they were never deposited this region.
VIII.
Tertiary Basins of the Upper Missouri.
Our present knowledge of the geological formations of the far west, leads me to modify, to some extent, the divisions of the Tertiary Basins given in my notes explanatory of the first edition of the geological map of Nebraska, published in May, 1857.
Considering the fresh water and estuary deposits at the mouth of the Judith as probably the equivalents of the Wealden of Europe, , we have the following subdivisions : 1st.
Grreat Lignite Tertiary Basin.
3nd.
White River Tertiary Basin.
IsL Great Lignite Tertiary Basin, As this formation, in its extensive development on the Upper Missouri, has been described quite fully in several preceding papers, I will here simply 148 notice its occurrence in tlie only locality where it was observed during tlie explorations of the past year, near the source of the South Fork of the Shyenne river.
It here rests conformably upon Cretaceous bed No.
5, and in no place exhibits any indications of having been disturbed by the subterranean forces which have wrought such changes in the physical features of this region.
The following section will represent the descending order of the beds as seen at this locality : â¬.
â Yellow arenaceous bed, holding the same position, I think, as the one at Fort Clark, which contains numerous fresh water shells.
d. â Light gray grit, with numerous iron-rust concretions, same bed, seen on Cherry Creek, Fort Clark, on the Missouri above Fort Union, and on the Yellow Stone, 20 to 30 feet.
c. â Very impure Lignite, .
.
.
.
.
.
, 4 to 6 feet.
h. â Dark ash colored clay passing up into the Lignite, ... 20 feet.
a.
â Fine yellow sand : about 6 feet exposed.
By reference to the colored map, the boundaries of this great basin will once be seen north and east of the Black Hills.
It will also be seen that mj former explorations show its full development on the Yellowstone, as high uP as the mouth of the Big Horn river.
It will then appear probable that its existence on the South Pork of the Shyenne indicates its extension from the Yellowstone, along the western base of the Black Hills, and that it adapts itself to the rugged features of the country, caused by the upheaval of the older formations, in the same manner as the Miocene Tertiary near Raw-Hide Peak and Laramie Peaks.
2d.
Tertiary Basin of White and Niobrara Rivers.
In St, former paper* I gave a vertical section of the different beds of this basin as far as they were known at that time.
During the past year, many Additional fa-cts, and a large collection of new organic remains have been secured, which enable me to present a section more accurate and complete.
It will be at once apparent from the list of localities for the different beds, how extensive a geographical area this basin occupies.
Vertical Section^ showing the order of superposition of the different beds of the Tertiary Basin of White and Niobrara Rivers.

Yellow silicious marl, similar in its character to the loess of the Rhine, passing down into variegated indurated clays and brown and yellow fine grits ; contains remains of extinct quadrupeds, mingled with those identical with recent ones ; alsoafewMoUusca, mostly identical with recent species so far as determined.
Most fully developed along the Missouri river, from the mouth of the Niobrara to St. Joseph ; also in the Platte Valley and on the Loup Fork.

Iâ I 12 \^ 1st, dark gray or brown sand, loose, incoherent, with remains of Mastodon, Elephant, &c. ; 2d, sand and gravel, incoherent ; 3d, yellowish white grit, with many calcareous, arenaceous concretions ; 4th, grey sand with a greenish tinge ; contains the greater part of the organic remains; 5th, deep yellowish red arenaceous marl ; 6th.
yellowish gray grit, sometimes quite calcareous, with numerous layers of concretionary limestone from two to six inches in thickness, containing fresh water and landshells, Succinea, Limnea, Paludina, Helix, &c., closely allied and perhaps identical with living species ; also much wood of coniferous character.
Covers a very large area on Loup Fork, from the mouth of North Branch to source of Loup Fork ; also in the Platte Valley.
Most fully developed on the Niobrara river, extending from the mouth of Turtle river three hundred m.iles up the Niobrara.
Also on Bijoux Hills and Medicine Hills.
Thinly represented in the valley of White river.
Usually a coarse grained sandstone, sometimes heavy bedded and compact ; sometimes loose and incoherent ; varies much in different localities.
Forms immense masses of conglomerate ; also contains layers of tabular limestone with indistinct organic remains ; very few mammalian remains detected, and those in a fragmentary condition.
Passes gradually into the bed below.
Most fully developed along the upper portion of Niobrara river and in the region around Fort Laramie.
Seen also on White river and on drindstone Hills.
A dull reddish brown indurated grit, with many layers of silico-calcareous concretions, sometimes forming a heavy bedded fine grained sandstone ; contains comparatively few organic remains.
Niobrara and Platte rivers ; well developed in the region of Fort Laramie ; also in the valley of White river, conspicuous, and composing the main part of the dividing ridge between White and Niobrara rivers.
Very fine yellow calcareous sand, not difl'ering very materially from Bed D, with numerous layers of concretions and rarely organic remains, passing down into a variegated bed, consisting of alternate layers of dark brown clay and light grey calcareous grit, forming bands, of which I counted twenty-seven at one locality, varying from one inch to two feet in thickness.
White river, Bear creek.
Ash Grove spring.
Head of tihyenne river.
Most conspicuous near White river.

Localities.
A deep flesh colored argillo-calcareous indurated grit ; the outside when weathered, has the appearance of a plastic clay.
Passes down into a gray clay, with layers of sandstone ; underlaid by a flesh colored argillocalcareous stratum, containing a profusion of Mammalian and Chelonian remains.
Turtle and Oreodon Bed.
Old Woman's creek, a fork of Shyenne river ; also on the head of the South Fork of the Shyenne ; most conspicuous on Sage and Bear creeks, and at Ash Grrove Spring.
Well developed in numerous localities in the valley of White river.
pq Light gray fine sand, with more or less calcareous matter, passing down into an ash-colored plastic clay, with large quantities of quartz grains disseminated through it, sometimes forming aggregated masses like quartzose sandstone cemented with plaster ; then an ash-colored clay with a greenish tinge, underlaid at base by a light gray and ferruginous silicious sand and gravel, with pinkish bands.
Immense quantities of silex in the form of seams all through the beds.
Titanotherium Bed.
Old Woman's creek ; also in many localities along the valley of the South Fork of Shyenne.
Best development on Sage and Bear creeks.
Seen at several localities in the valley of White river.
Cretaceous beds 5 and 4, with their usual lithological characters and fossils.
Exposed underneath the Tertiary Beds on the South Fork of Shyenne and its Southern Branches, also in White river valley near its source.
By reference to the map it will be seen that our route, which is indicated by a dotted line, led us up the Loup Fork of the Platte river to its source, thence a little west of North to the Niobrara river, and up the latter river to Fort Laramie.
From Fort Laramie we proceeded nearly north to the Black Hills, and, on our return, crossed the Shyenne and White rivers, striking the Niobrara again above the mouth of Little Rapid river.
We then passed down the Niobrara to its entrance into the Missouri river.
Inasmuch as the surface deposit ot the greater portion of the country thus passed over, is composed of the different beds of the Tertiary basin of which I am now treating.
I think I can show more clearly the geographical area of this formation and that of its subdivisions, also the changes in the lithological characters, by givinga brief digest of my journal as we proceeded from point to point.
Ascending the Loup Fork, the first indication we observed of this formation was near the old Pawnee village, about eight miles above the mouth of Beaver creek.
Here we found, near the bed of the river, large masses of pebbly conglomerate, cemented with a calcareous grit, which undoubtedly belongs to bed [June.
151 ^ of the vertical section.
The distant hills, on either side of the river, are covered with a considerable thickness of Pliocene and Post Pliocene beds.
Near the mouth of North Branch the following section of the strata, in' descending order, were observed : d. â Yellowish brown laminated argillaceous grit ; effervesces briskly with muriatic acid.
c. â Similar to the bed above, but of a deeper color, more compact, containing a greater per cent, of clay, with numerous calcareous concretions disseminated through it, ----70 to 100 feet.
b.
â Light brown clay, filled with fine whitish particles like magnesia.
70 feet.
a.
â Gray, coarse sand, forming a heavy bedded sandstone, reaches to the waters edge, 30 feet.
In the upper beds of the above local section, fragments of Mammalian and Chelonian remains were found, and all but the lower bed, which is bed E of the vertical section, are Pliocene.
Lt. Warren explored the North Branch thirty miles above its mouth, and met with a similar series of beds, containingthe same organic remains.
Above the mouth of North Branch, bed a of the local section appears, in the form of large ledges of light gray arenaceous limestone, filled with silicified tubes like the stems of plants, and seeds resembling cherry stones In the Pliocene beds, on the distant hills, when exposed by erosion, I found numerous fragments of bones and teeth of Hipparion, Cervus, &c. About Ion.
99Â° we enter the desolate region of the Sand Hills.
I measured the heighth of these hills at one locality and found them to be two hundred and thirty feet above the bed of Loup Fork, and composed of Pliocene beds as a base, then a thin bed of Post Pliocene marl, overlaid by a great thickness of loose incoherent sand and gravel, derived from the erosion of the different Tertiary beds.
The whole country from the head of Loup Fork presents a similar character, consisting of movable sand hills, the true Tertiary beds being very seldom exposed.
On the South Branch, the stream cuts though the following Pliocene strata.
c â Yellowish brown grit, containing Ilastodon micificus^ (Leidy.)
b â White chalky stratum, charged with fresh water and land shells of the genera Helix, Flanorbis, Limnea, &c., probably identical with recent species, __________ 3 feet.
a â Heavy bedded gray sandstone, 8 tO 10 feet.
From the head of Loup Fork to the Niobrara river the whole country is covered with this superficial deposit of sand, which is blown by the wind into ridges and high conical hills, rendering travelling quite difficult.
On reaching the Niobrara we find bed E quite well developed, also a full series of the Pliocene beds filled with Mammalian remains.
Passing up the Niobrara about fifty miles, the Pliocene strata gradually disappear, and the whole country is occupied by the Upper Miocene beds U and D. A Butte near this point affords a fine detailed section of the gray sandstone bed which, measured from the base, with a pocket level, I found to be one hundred and sixty-six feet in heighth.
It is composed mostly of a gray coarse grit, sometimes quite incoherent, containing many layers of concretionary sandstone.
On the summit is a thin bed of shelving limestone similar to that containing organic remains at Pinau's spring, though probably not holding the same geological position.
Indistinct traces of freshwater shells and numerous remains of fishes, scales, vertebrae, &c., were visible in the tabular masses.
It seems to form the upper portion of bed E, and to vary much in its character in different localities.
It presents every variety from a translucent chalcedony to a fine grained sandstone or compact limestone, and furnishes those chalcedonic masses which meet the eye of the traveller so often and have the appearance of erratic blocks.
Farther from the river, and holding a higher position than the summit of the Butte, are thin beds of yellow and yellowish gray calcareous grit undoubtedly of Pliocene age, containing numerous fragments of teeth and finely preserved bones of the Uastodon and Elephant.
As we pass up the river the gray sandstone bed E presents a great variety of lithological characters.
Sometimes it forms a coarse 1858.]
152 conglomerate, then an aggregate of grains of quartz cemented by calcareous matter.
About sixty miles above the point where we struck the Niobrara, bed i), of the vertical section, is revealed to the water's edge.
The dip of the strata towards the east gradually brings this bed to view quite conspicuously.
It is composed of a flesh colored calcareous grit, and the eroded material of this bed gives to the country a dull reddish yellow tint.
It also contains many layers of silico-calcareous concretions, forming large ledges which break into irregular masses on exposure.
The more incoherent material has much the color and appearance of that composing the Turtle bed at Bear creek, but contains much less clay.
It does not differ materially from its equivalent in the White river valley, of which Eagle Nest Butte forms a part.
Leaving the Niobrara river for Fort Laramie, we pass over a large area covered with sand hills, which have a dull ferruginous tinge, and are evidently composed of the eroded materials from bed D. One of these hills measured one hundred and eighty feet in heighth, with very steep sides, its present conformation being preserved by the roots of vast numbers of a species of Yucca, which cover the hill and seem to find their maximum growth in this sandy soil.
Near Spoonbill creek bed E is composed mostly of a very coarse conglomerate, formed of angular and water-worn fragments similar to those seen in the granitic, metamorphic and carboniferous rocks, in the Black Hills, the fragments varying in size from one-eighth of an inch, to four inches in diameter and cemented with rather coarse silicious sand.
It kere forms huge overhanging ledges, large masses of which have fallen to the base of the hills, and are scattered over the plains below, giving to the scenery a very rugged appearance.
On Raw Hide Butte creek, bed D approximates more closely in its character to the turtle bed B of the vertical section.
On an exposed area, not more than eight or ten yards square, in the valley of the creek, I observed fragments of at least eight turtles ( Testudo nehrascensis) with a few mammalian remains similar to those found so abundantly in bed at Ash Grrove Spring.
The upper Miocene beds E and D occupy the country around Fort Laramie, exclusively, and extend to the base of the Laramie range of mountains.
Bed Z> attains by far the greatest thickness, bed having been eroded away to a great extent, and losing its conglomerate character, while bed D becomes one hundred and eighty to two hundred feet in thickness.
The incoherent materials are here much more calcareous and of a finer grit, while the concretionary layers are formed of a sandstone coarser grained than at localities heretofore mentioned.
From Fort Laramie to Laramie Hills, August lid.
Our course was 10Â° south of west from Fort Laramie ; travelled over Tertiary beds E and D for twelve miles, until we came to the head of Warm Spring, where we observed a bed of carboniferous limestone seventy-five feet in thickness.
The strata seem to dip gently each way from a central axis, and are exposed at this locality over an area of only five or six hundred square yards.
The upheaval is evidently a local one, the limestones being revealed by the erosion and removal of the Tertiary beds from the valley of the stream, which are every where undisturbed, resting unconformably upon the limestones on all sides.
Nine miles farther on our route, another upheaval is exposed by the wearing away of the Tertiary beds in the valley of the Big Cotton Wood creek.
Here we have eighty feet of carboniferous limestone, with a similar central axis of elevation from which the strata dip in all directions, while the Tertiary beds again rest unconformably upon their inclined edges.
As we approach the Laramie Hills, no carboniferous rocks were seen in place, but the whole country is covered with a heavy deposit of drift, consisting of gravel and water-worn boulders from all the formations in this region.
Descending the Laramie Fork toward Fort Laramie, we again find the country covered with a thick deposit of drift, composed of a great variety of more [June 153 or less water-worn materials derived from the mountains.
The true Tertiarybeds are revealed, by erosion, occasionally near the bed of the river, but no indications of the upheaval of the carboniferous rocks.
x\bout twelve miles above Fort Laramie, both on the Laramie river, and the Platte a remarkable deposit is seen, composed of a coarse conglomerate, fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in thickness, of a recent character, and evidently formed since the scooping out of the present river valleys.
Indeed the form of the deposit is that of a basin twUve or fifteen miles in length, and reaching its greatest thickness only in the valleys of the rivers, while the more elevated portions of the country between the Forks consist of the true Tertiary beds.
It seems to vary from an aggregation of particles of quartz to an exceedingly coarse conglomerate made up of every variety of material, much of which I have not yet seen in place.
Fort Laramie to the Black Hills.
Proceeding north from Fort Laramie, we pass over Tertiary beds for the first seven miles, and then come to an extension of the Laramie range of Hills, which exhibits many peculiarities.
The whole range appears to be composed of a group of conical elevations, and ridges which seem to illustrate very clearly, the irregular efi"ect of the subterranean forces by which they were upheaved.
A considerable thickness of carboniferous limestone was observed upon the sides and summits of these elevations, inclining at various angles, depending upon the power of the disturbing force from beneath, and when unchanged byheat contain numerous fossils.
We can here see every variety of carboniferous limestone, from the unchanged fossiliferous rock, to that of a completely metamorphosed character, with the indications of stratification nearly or quite obliterated.
Sometimes the melted material is thrust up through fissures in the unchanged rock, so that in a single hand specimen we have the changed and unchanged rock.
The metamorphosed carboniferous limestones are usually of a deep red color, very compact, sometimes assuming a vitreous aspect, ^ but never the thoroughly crystalline character of the older azoic rocks.
Sometimes the limestones are elevated, so as to leave the strata horizontal, then again they are inclined at an angle of ten to thirty degrees.
At tlie base of these ridges, the upper Miocene beds are seen insinuating themselves into ravines, or deposited high up on the sides of the elevations, thus filling up the irregularities formed by the numerous local disturbances.
In all cases the Tertiary beds are undisturbed, and not unfrequently rest directly upon the vertical edges of the azoic or granitic rocks.
About eight miles west of Raw Hide Peak, the carboniferous limestones present a peculiar appearance, not unlike that of some Tertiary strata upon the Yellowstone, which have been fused or semi-fused by the burning out of the Lignite beds.
The fused masses are very compact and heavy, varying in composition and color, red, yellow and mottled, oftentimes containing small fragments of partially changed rock, thus forming a sort of breccia.
After crossing the Niobrara river, the upheavals nearly cease, the blue carboniferous limestone only being exposed in a few places.
The Tertiary beds occupy the larger portion of the country.
Passing the dividing ridge, between the Niobrara and Shyenne rivers, into the Valley of Old Woman's creek, we find the Tertiary attaining its full development, and assuming a variety of fantastic forms from erosion, like the Bad Lands at Ash Grove Spring.
The hills were covered with small pines.
On the east side of Old Woman's creek is a high ridge, trending southwest and southeast, composed of variegated sandstone, varying from a fine compact silicious rock to a coarse reddish conglomerate or sandstone, with no fossils, except indistinct traces of vegetable remains.
This ridge, which belongs to Cretaceous formation No.
1, is the result of a less violent upheaval, and is exposed by the erosion of the Tertiary beds from the valley.
On the distant hills, on each side of the valley, the denuded Tertiary beds are visible, while near the bottom of the stream the Titanotherium bed was observed by Lieut.
War1858.]
154 ren, presenting its usual lithological characters, and containing bones and teeth of the animal from which it derives its name.
The following section of strata, in descending order, will show the details of this upheaval.
g. â Layers of whitish oolitic limestone, doubtless Tertiary.
f. â Compact ferruginous sandstone, ...... 80 feet.
e. â Yellow friable sandstone, ....... 2 feet.
d. â Light gray fine clay, ........ 4 feet.
c. â Yellowish white sandstone, quite friable, .... 5 feet.
h. â Drab or ash colored indurated clay, passing down into red clay, 6 feet.
a.
â Variable incoherent clays, red, yellowish, &c., which may be of Jurassic age, 50 feet.
Passing down the valley toward the Shyenne, the Tertiary beds disappear, and the Cretaceous bed No.
5 occupies the country.
At one locality an upheaval was observed, exposing all the subdivisions of the Cretaceous rocks, as will appear from the following section : No.

Nos.
4, 3 and 2 present only the vertical edges of this strata, across which the above measurements were taken.
The strata of No.
1 seem to have been elevated so as to retain a nearly horizontal position.
No.
3 at this locality contains numerous fossils, the most abundant of which are Ostrea congesta ^nd Inoceramus prohleynaticus.
This bed does not present altogether the same lithological character as on the Missouri river, but possesses a more laminated and gritty structure, sometimes approaching to a calcareous sandstone.
Crossing the Shyenne, on our way northward, we have the commencement of a series of ridges of upheaval, which surround the Black Hills.
I could not ascertain that there was any regularity in the dip and strike of the strata, each ridge or local upheaval ditFering from the other in that respect.
As we approach the southern base of the Black Hills, the strata incline very nearly to the southeast.
No.
1 does not appear, but we have a fine development of No.
2, possessing all its characteristics of plastic clay, with ashcolored grit concretions, containing an abundance of well preserved fossils ; No.
3, with large quantities of 0. congesta and /.
problematicits, in an exceedingly comminuted condition ; No.
4 also appears, and No.
5 caps the hills on all sides.
Nos.
2 and 3 are exposed only by the upheaval.
On a branch of Beaver creek we find No.
2. one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet in thickness, and presenting its usual characters in full.
Inasmuch as the principal facts relating to the Geology of the Black Hills have already been discussed, I will omit the details of our exploration of them, and pass on to a description of the country along our route, from Bear Peak, on the north eastern base of the Black Hills, to the entrance of the Niobrara river into the Missouri.
Near Bear Peak, No.
2 is quite largely developed, presenting its usual lithological characters, and containing great quantities of fish remains, but no other fossils were seen in it.
No.
1 is composed of variegated clays, grits and sand-, stones, with indistinct vegetable-impressions, fossil wood, and a few uncharacteristic Saurian bones.
No.
3 is also exposed by the upheaval of the beds, with its usual fossils, but possessing the character of a laminated calcareous sandstone, instead of the soft homogeneous calcareous marl of the Missouri river.
From thence to the Shyenne, No.
4 forms a surface of the country, for the most part undisturbed.
I will not here dwell upon the influences which the eroding power of water must have exerted, in modifying the physical features of the country in and [J une, 155 around the Black Hills.
I am inclined to the opinion, however, that prior to the convulsion that upheaved the fossiliferous rocks, only the Cretaceous "beds Nos.
4 and 5 were exposed in any portion of this region.
Along the Shyenne River, No.
4 contains most finely preserved fossils in the greatest abundance.
Large Ammonites, two to three feet in diameter, still preserving their original pearly lustre, Scaphites, Baculites, Ostrea, &c. Ascending the valley of Sage Creek, we pass over the Cretaceous beds for the first five miles, which contain an abundance of fossils similar to those found on the Shyenne.
We then meet with the lowest bed of the great Tertiary Basin of White River, resting conformably upon Cretaceous strata, which appear to be a blending of Nos.
4 and 5.
We have, first, the dark clays of No.
4, then the yellowish brown, gritty shale of No.
5, with numerous ferruginous concretions ; then the Titanotherium bed which sets regularly upon No.
5, and exhibits its highest development in the valleys of Sage and Bear Creeks.
It is here composed, 1st, of a band of argillaceous grit weathering to a pink color, two feet in thickness, passing up into an ash colored plastic clay with a greenish tinge, full of chalcedony and calcareous concretions, altogether 50 to 80 feet in thickness ; then a light gray calcareous grit upon which rests the Turtle Bed.
A considerable deposit of drift consisting of water-worn bowlders, and loose sand and gravel, is distributed over the surface of the Bad Lands to a greater or less extent.
Proceeding up the valley of the Shyenne, we see only the Cretaceous beds Nos.
4 and 5, until we pass the mouth of Bear Creek, when the Tertiary makes its appearance, crossing the Shyenne and stretching off toward the base of the Black Hills in long ridges or isolated Buttes.
The belt of Tertiary on the left side of the Shyenne is about thirty miles in width.
A section fifteen miles above the mouth of Bear Creek, on the Shyenne, presents the following characters.
c. â Light gray indurated clay, 6 feet.
b.
â Seam of gray sandstone, 18 inches.
Â«â¢ â Ash-colored plastic clay with a greenish tinge, and a pinkish band of fine grit at the base, ; 30 feet.
The Titanotherium Bed varies much in its lithological characters in different localities.
The layer of gray sandstone is sometimes two to four feet in thickness, composed of an aggregate of water-worn pebbles, with granular quartz, and small particles of mica, forming somewhat conspicuous ledges.
On the western side of the Shyenne, the Titanotherium bed presents the following characters proceeding upward from No.
5 : First, alternate seams of small pebbles and loose sand, two to six inches in thickness, passing up into a fine ferruginous grit, containing small scales of mica, weathering to a light gray color, then a band of pinkish gritty clay, six inches in thickness, passing up into ash-colored clay which has also alternate gritty layers.
The pink band if quite persistent, and being exposed whenever the Titanotherium Bed is worn through, marks with a good degree of precision the base of the Tertiary.
The surface in many places is covered with water-worn pebbles, varying in size from an eighth of an inch to eighteen inches in diameter, though mostly small, and representing all the varieties of metamorphosed rocks, with rounded masses of lime and flint rock, fossil wood, &c., so that No.
5, when the Titanotherium Bed is eroded away, is paved with this loose material.
The Turtle Bed alone does not sÂ«em to be so marked in its character here as at Bear Creek.
It weathers to a light yellow color and passes almost insensibly into the bed above.
I have marked the line of separation at this locality, between the Turtle bed and the one overlying it, by a layer of very porous argillaceous sandstone of a dull brown or drab color.
The Turtle bed contains much more sand than at Bear Creek, and the upper portion consists of alternate layers of calcareous concretions and indurated argillaceous grit with one band, eight feet in thickness, of ash-colored clay.
Disseminated through the bed in every direction, are thin seams of chal1858.]
156 cedony, A few mammalian remains were found, mostly of Oreodon and Rhino'-eros.
On the right or east side of the Shyenne, as we pass over to White River, the Cretaceous bed No.
5 presents some peculiarities which may be worthy of notice, inasmuch as the upper portion seems to form a transition or bed of passage into the Tertiary.
We have, first, No.
4, black laminated clay gradually passing up into dark brown clay, then becoming deep ferruginous ; again a dull purplish hue, with seams half an inch to an inch in thickness of ferruginous matter passing up into a deep yellow arenaceous clay ; lastly, a brown clay underlying the Titanotheriura bed.
I have been thus minute in describing these beds, from the fact that the transition from the Cretaceou?
to the Tertiary period seems as gradual and as natural as that of any of the subdivisions of the Cretaoeous system into each other ; and were it not for the organic remains which characterize each, we would scarcely be aware that we were passing from one great geological period to another.
At another locality the Titanotherium bed at the base consists of clay with a purplish tinge, filled with angular grains of quartz and water-worn pebbles, two feet ; then a loose incoherent gravel, with pebbles, four inches ; then six to eight feet of light gray clay, filled with pebbles and angular grains of quartz, sometimes forming a sort of quartzose sandstone, passing up into a dark ashâ 'olored clay, with a greenish tinge.
A section of the different beds, is shown on White River, would be as follows : f Flesh colored marl, ...... 10 feet.

Cretaceous Beds J^os.
5 and 4.
In the valley of White River the Cretaceous beds Nos.
5 and 4 are exposed by the erosion of the overlying Tertiary beds, as may be seen by reference to the accompanying map.
No.
5 reveals numerous fossils in similar tough argillaceous concretions, as those observed on the west side of the Shyenne.
All the calcareous matter has been dissolved away from the shells, leaving only casts.
The upper portion presents a variety of lithological characters, and is destitute of fossils.
Leaving the valley of V/hite River, we proceeded nearly a south-east course, ascending gradually to the dividing ridge between White and Niobrara Rivers, where we find the largest development of bed Z>, which exhibits its usual lithological characters, but contains very few fossils.
Passing the head of woundedknee creek, we begin to see indications of the Pliocene formation, with a few mammalian remains, and on reaching the Niobrara, the upper Miocene bed^ are covered with a thick deposit of Pliocene strata.
This more recent formation presents at this locality the same lithological characters as those given in the vertical section, and extends nearly to the mouth of Turtle Hill creek, where Cretaceous beds Nos.
4 and 3 gradually rise to the surface and cover the country.
Outliers of Pliocene are visible, however, on both sides of the Missouri River in many localities, the principal of which are Medicine and Bijoux Hills, the latter of which has yielded several very interesting species of Mammalia [June^ 157 Upper Miocene bed D is not unfrequently revealed in the channel of the Niobrara, presenting a very irregular outline, showing most conclusively the great erosion that must have taken place prior to the deposition of the Pliocene beds.
It would seem that after the deposition of the materials that entombed the Miocene fauna, this whole region was eroded so as to present the same rugged features as the Bad Lands of White River, and that the Pliocene beds were deposited upon this irregular surface entombing a second fauna, specifically distinct from, yet intermediate between that of the Miocene and our present period.
I have attempted, in the illustrative section* along the Niobrara, to show the irregular outline of the bed Z>, prior to the deposition of the recent beds.
The greatest thickness of Pliocene is always found in the valleys of the streams, and in consequence of its loose incoherent character is much denuded, forming thf principal part of the material of the sand hills.

Twenty-four members present.
A paper entitled '^Descriptions of twelve New Species of Uniones, and other Fresh-water Shells of the Uuited States, by Isaac Lea/' was presented for publication in the Proceedings.
Dr.
Le Gonte stated, in regard to the small collection of Coleopterous Insects of Japan presented this evening by Dr. A.
A. Henderson, U. S. N., that seYerai 1858.]
164 of the species exhibited a remarkable resemblance to some found in the United States.
Yet this resemblance was not between species of groups peculiar to the eastern sides of both continents, if any such exist, nor between those found on either margin of the Pacific Ocean, but was found in species belonging to cosmopolitan genera, and the parallelism was between those of Japan and those of the Atlantic States.
He had previously shown, in comparing the Coleoptera of Western America with those of Europe, that where parallelism existed it was also in genera of similarly wide distribution.
He also called attention to a very remarkable species of Carabus in the same collection, which imitates, by its slender form and long narrow thorax, the genus Damaster from the same region, and seems to connect the latter with the ordinary Carabus, just as Damaster connects Carabus with Cychrus.
While possessing this remarkable form of body, however, the elytra are destitute of the apical prolongation seen in Damaster, and the sculpture is that of certain Carabi, consisting of approximate punctures, with three faint ranges of chain-like elevations.
On leave granted, the Committee appointed to confer with Dr. Hayes in regard to his proposed Arctic Exploration, presented a Report as follows : That the exploration contemplated by Dr. Hayes appears to deserve the encouragement of all individuals or societies who possess an interest in the advancement of science, and especially of those who cultivate the various branches of Natural History, for the following reasons : 1st.
The interesting problem of the existence of an open Polar Sea cannot as yet be considered as satisfactorily solved ; as is made manifest by the doubts recently expressed by a distinguished geographer, in a memoir read before the Royal Geographical Society of London.
Yet this problem is so intimately connected with theories of climate, not only in that region, but over a very large partion of the Northern Hemisphere, that its definite solution must be considered as of the utmost importance to the study of geography ; and it is not impossible that its investigation may lead to valuable results of a more commercial nature.
It seems probable, therefore, that this subject will attract the attention of other nations, who are engaged in an honorable rivalry with us in promoting the knowledge of the surface of the earth, and it is highly desirable that the credit of furnishing the definite solution should belong to the nation to whose energy and enterprise the interesting results already obtained are due.
2d.
The natural history of this extensive region remains, as yet, almost entirely unknown ; while, from the peculiarities of its climate, and its proximity to the land of the Eastern Hemisphere, it seems certain that much valuable information as to the habits of animals and plants, and the connection of our Faunas and Floras, both ancient and modern, with those of Europe and Asia, may be gained by such an exploration as is here contemplated.
3d.
The excessive difficulties and hardships of such an exploration, serve to deter any but the most adventurous spirits from undertaking it ; while the peculiar circumstances under which both the instruments of observation and the observers themselves are placed, render a frequent repetition of the observations necessary to produce confidence in the results.
Every encouragement should therefore be extended to all who are willing to undertake the arduous task, and capable of properly meeting its unusual responsibilities.
The Committee therefore recommend to the Academy the adoption of the following resolutions : Resolved, That the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, having full confidence in the energy, ^prudence and scientific capacity of Dr. Hayes, recommends the Arctic expedition projected by him to the favorable consideration of all who are in a position to assist him in his enterprise, believing that its success will contribute largely to the advancement of science and to the honor of our country.
[July, 165 Resolved, That the Academy will cheerfully assist Dr. Hayes in carrying out his plans by all the means in its power.
The Report and resolutions were adopted, and the Committee continued.

A paper was presented for publication in the Proceedings entitled, " Mineralogical Notes, by W. J.
Taylor."
Dr. Leidy made the following remarks : In the 5th volume of the Proceedings I have described a species of terrestrial planaria {Rhynchodemus sylvaticus,) discovered in the neighborhood of this city.
This singular animal is exceedingly rare.
I have sought for it in many localities without having found specimens.
In the 1858.]
172 spriag of 1857, I examined damp forests in the neighborhood of Wilmington, J^orth Carolina, and Charleston, South Carolina, without detecting it.
In August, of 1857, while seeking salamanders and helices, in company with Dr. "Wilson and Mr. Conrad, on the summit of Broad Top Mountain, of the Alleghany range, in western Pennsylvania, I found one specimen.
Last mouth, while on a visit to our fellow member, Mr, S. Powel, at Newport, R. I., one damp morning I observed two fine specimens of the planaria, creeping near the top of a fence 8 feet in height.
On the night of the same day, at the proposal of Mr. Powel, by the light of a lantern, we sought for the animal about the fence surrounding his grounds, and in the course of an hour we found twelve fine specimens.
They were obtained from all parts of the fence, some on the top, and others on the ground.
Eight of them I have preserved alive, and now have them at my residence, living in a glass box beneath some fragments of moist wood.
Occasionally I feed them on a crushed house-fly, which they appear to enjoy, as they suck at it with their protruded oesophagus for an hour at a time.
They are from 5 to 7 lines long, and creep about like the slug, with their snoutlike head erect.
They are light-ash colored, with a blackish streak down each side of the back, and a blackish spot just back of the middle, corresponding in position below with the mouth.
In form they are like an awl split in its length, the narrower end forming the head.
At the base of the latter is a pair of prominent black eyes.
The lateral borders of the head are often inflected, and the head itself is sometimes, in a state of rest, doubled upon the back.
The intestine presents the same dendritic arrangement as in the true fluviatile planariae.
Dr. Meigs made some remarks touching the importance of obtaining statistics regarding the actual condition of Craniological collections, with a view to establish a system of exchanges.

BY W. J. TAYLOR.
Lecontite.
This new and interesting mineral is remarkable as being a double sulphate of ammonia and soda with potash, containing two equivalents of water, and yet homceomorphous with the group of the anhydrous sulphates, and with Mascagnine, which contains but one equivalent of water.
According to Prof. Dana (System.
Mineralogy, p. 379), the formula for Mascagnine is RO, SO3 2 HO, but this is a typographical error ; the proper formula for this mineral being RO, SO3 + HO, as will be seen in Sixth Supplement to Mineralogy by Prof. Dana.
Lecontite and Mascagnine are consequently homceomorphous, its difference in angle being about four degrees, (Lecontite, /: /= 103Â° 12^, 0:11+ 117Â° 7/ ; Mascagnine, /: J=107Â° 40^ 0 : H 122Â° 56^,) and yet the one contains two equivalents of water and the other but one.
Prof. Dana has very kindly made the annexed measurements of two crystals, which I sent to him soon after receiving the mineral from Dr.
Le Conte, which measurements I made the substance of a verbal communication to the Academy, on the evening of the 16th of February, but owing to a mistake, it did not appear in print (though it is recorded in the minutes of that meeting) before the May number of the Academy's Proceedings.
It was at this time supposed to be a new mineral, from the difl'erence in angle found by Prof. Dana between it and other homoeomorphous sulphates ; and by a qualitative analysis that I made^ [Aug. 178 it was considered to be a double sulphate of potash and ammonia, (the potash, I then thought, was in excess,) and anhydrous, (in this judging erroneously from the form).
The composition is now definitely determined by a thorough quantitative examination, which, by the courtesy of Dr. F. A. Genth, I have made in his laboratory, and whom I here thank, for the facilities afforded me in the investigation of this new mineral.
Lecontite occurs in crystals varying greatly in size, some being an inch in length and narrow prisms ; others are short, not exceeding one-eighth of an inch in length and quite broad.
The smaller crystals are more perfect in form than the larger ones, and the angles are better defined.
The following are the measurements of Prof. Dana ; the crystals he mentions did not admit of measurement by a reflected image, so that it was necessary to use a candle : Trimetric or right rhombic prism â i2 : I =160'* by measurement, : ie= 12*?Â° 30^â128Â° (or over n, 52Â° â 52Â«* 30' /: / (calculated from e^: i2 = {.Hlf/^ZlS The faces / are small and indistinct except on one side.

Taste saline and rather bitter.
Permanent in the air; they contain as follows ; Ammonia, per ct. 12-94 contains oxygen 3-981 Potash, " 2-67 " " 0-45 }-8-93.
Soda, " 17-56 " Â» 4-50 J Sulphuric acid, " 44-97 " " 26-94 Water, " 19-45 " " 17-28 Organic residue, " 2-30 Inorganic residue, " 0-11 Phosphoric acid, " a trace There is consequently an oxygen ratio of ammonia, soda and sulphuric acid and water, according to the numbers 8-93 : 26-94: 17-28, which is almost exactly as 1:3:2, from which we have the general formula RO SO3 -j2H0, and from this the specific formula (as Prof. Dana would write it) 2NH4 0, SO3 -f-o (NaO, KO) SO3 + 10 HO 5 or ( ] NH4 0 1 NaO, KO) SO3 + 2H0).
[It may be interesting to mention that there is an artificial salt, with a formula exactly corresponding to this, and of the same form, which, though rare, has been described by several chemists; it contains no potash, being solely Â».
double sulphate of ammonia and soda, with the two equivalents of water, as mentioned above.

174 tioa and measurements by Mitscherlich : Pogg.
Ann., 58, 469, but at present not having the works to compare, I am unable to conclude whether or not it is another salt, homoeomorphous with the one just described.
The similarity of form between compounds, in which there is a difference in the equivalents of water, is an interesting subject for investigation, and I shall endeavor to show at a future time, that the Trimetric sulphate of ammonia, generally considered anhydrous, may contain one or two equivalents of water, and yet preserve its homoeomorphism.]
Lecontite was brought to this country, in January last, by Dr. John L. Le Conte, on his return from Honduras.
He discovered it in the cave near Las Piedras, in the vicinity of Comayagua.
It occurs in crystals imbedded in a black matrix, resembling bitumen in appearance, which Dr.
Le Conte considers to be the decomposed excrement of bats, which infest this cave in great numbers, and have, most likely, inhabited it for ages.
The cave near the entrance was, at the time of his visit, being worked for nitre, which was obtained 'â¢^ directly by lixiviating the earth taken from near the mouth of the cave. "
The material containing the crystals merely furnished a tarry, black, semifluid mass, without nitre."
On some of the crystals were observed minute hairs of the bats adhering, and I observed mor^, when removing the crystals from their matrix.
In honor of Dr.
Le Conte, for this interesting species which he has been the means of adding to mineralogy, I propose to call the mineral Lecontite.
Sulphate of Ammonia and Soda.
In looking over specimens of minerals recently presented to the Academy, my attention was attracted by a substance labelled " Ammonia," from the Chincha Islands of the Pacific Ocean; from its appearance it was suspected to be a sulphate of ammonia, and a qualitative examination confirmed my suspicion.
It is in compact lumps, about the size of hickory nuts ; hardness from 2.5 to 3 : its color is a yellowish white, with a crystalline structure, taste pungent and bitter : opaque and permanent in the air.
By a qualitative analysis, I found it to contain sulphuric acid, ammonia, soda and some organic matter, and by my first trials iu a matrass I could not find water ; on repeating them, I have found a small quantity.
Whether the water is really a part of the mineral a quantitative analysis only can determine.
I made an approximative determination of the sulphuric acid from a small fragment, and found it to contain about 48 per cent.
Heated on platinum foil it blackens and fuses, though not very readily, leaving a white bead, which is soluble in water, and tastes a little saline and bitter.
This mineral was presented to the Academy, I believe, by Dr. Bridges.
Siercoriie ?
I am indebted to Dr. Bridges for a specimen of a mineral from the Chincha Guano Islands, accompanying the sulphate above described, which, from a qualitative analysis, I now suppose to be Stercorite, (microcosmic salt,) which has been discovered by T. J. Herapath, Esq., in the guano from the Island of Ichaboe, on the western coast of Africa ; it never has to my knowledge been found in the Pacific guano.
I hope to get sufficient material to settle definitely whether it belongs to this species.
The mineral which I have is columnar in structure, and has evidently been taken from a crevice in the guano.
It is opaque ; yellowish white in color, very soft, taste somewhat sharp, saline and slightly ammoniacal, partially deliquescent in the air.

B. or gently heated on platinum foil over a spirit lamp it intumesces and blackens, giving off ammonia and water ; afterwards it fuses to a clear bead, which is readily soluble in water and has a saline taste.
By a qualitative examination I found ammonia, soda, and an excess of phosphoric acid.
The physical characters are quite different from those of the stercorite described by Mr. Herapath, but the chemical components and the reactions before the blow pipe are similar.

Stauroiide?
A mineral resembling the so called Staurotide (?)
found at the Canton Mine, Georgia, described by Prof. Shepard, (3d Supplement Dana's Mineralogy, p. 16,) I have found some time since, at a copper mine near Webster, Jackson Co., N. C. associated with automolite crystals as at the former locality.
The preliminary analyses made of the mineral from the Canton Mine by Dr. Genth and myself, (the results of which agree,) renders the conclusion as to its being Staurotide very doubtful.
Cuproplumhite ?
Among the ores brought home by Dr.
Le Conte from his recent explorations in Honduras, was a specimen which particularly attracted my attention, from the mine of Antonio Cruz, near Comayagua ; apparently it is galena, being massive and granular, with a cubical cleavage, on the faces of which there is a bronze tarnish, which gives the effect of a play of colors not unlike that on Bastite (Schiller Spar), the color being more coppery.
On the edges it is decomposed, forming massive carbonate of lead, whilst the copper (in little geodes), as crystallized malachite, is disseminated through the mass.

Upper wings with, both surfaces fulvous ; above with, a broad, black exterior margin containing a range of seven small whitish spots parallel with the 1858.]
margin, four large oblong spots of black proceeding from tbe exterior margin, the two intermediate ones reaching beyond the middle of the wing, the others shorter, with each a small fulvous spot near the tip ; and four spots of black descending from the sub-costal nervure, of which the one nearest the body is linear, the next square, the third roundish with a fulvous spot in the centre, and the fourth connate with the fourth of the before mentioned spots proceeding from the exterior margin.
The lower wings are above bluish black, changing to brownish fulvous near the base, with an indistinct whitish spot below the centre.
The under side of the upper wings has seven spots of pearly white parallel with the outer margin, of which the five exterior ones are linear, and the two others round ; from these two round spots proceed two oblong black spots to the middle of the wing, and the two next have each a round black spot above them.
From the sub-costal nervure proceed four black spots, of which the two nearest the body are linear, the next triangular, enclosing a fulvous spot, and the fourth is almost confounded with the black upper margin.
The under side of the lower wings is brown, with four white sublunate spots, bounded above and below by black, and parallel with the lower margin ; there are likewise two long black spots outside of the outer one of these spots : the whole base of the wing is occupied by six large pearly spots radiating from the axilla, one of which occupies the pre-costal portion ; between the second and third (which are very wide) is a smaller spot, and the third is crossed near its base by a short black bar.
The emarginations of the wings are margined with white.
Body black, thorax thickly covered with brownish fulvous hairs.
The above described Lepidopteron so nearly resembles the Argynnis Idalia, that at first sight it may easily be taken for a mere variety.
The want of the double row of white spots on the upper surface of the lower wings, although a remarkable difierence, would not perhaps constitute a specific mark, yet when we come to examine the under surface, instead of the twenty-four or twentyfive spots of white, which are observed over its whole surface, we find but two near the margin and six large ones occupying nearly the whole of the base, and radiating from the axilla, we cannot hesitate to pronounce it distinct and certainly new.
The larva is unknown.
The interesting fact of so large a species of butterfly being found at this time in New Jersey, and having heretofore escaped the researches of all entomologists, has led me to offer this short communication for publication in the Proceedings.

BY JOHN L. LE CONTE, M. D. Having a number of nondescript species of Eleodes, which it becomes necessary to mention in a Catalogue of the Coleoptera of the TJ.
S. and Mexican Boundary, now preparing for the press, I have considered it proper here to present descriptions of these species ; and for the purpose of elucidating their characters in the absence of a monographic essay, the following grouping of the species in my collection belonging to this very difiicult genus may be found useful.
They are now very numerous, and quite heterogeneous in form, though tbe antennae and oral organs do not seem to have much variation.
A. Elytra subconvex or depressed, oblong oval, margined or not, more or less sulcate (but in E. dispersa almost irregularly punctured and not striate) ; humeral angles distinctly margined.

Of the same form as E. obscura, but with the thorax larger and less convex, the elytra a little more elongated and not at all striate ; the punctures are slightly muricated, even on the middle of the back ; at the sides and tip they become confluent transversely and more elevated, with a very short black bristle at the apex of each ; the sides of the elytra are not at all margined.
The under surface and legs as in E. obscura, except that the tooth of the anterior femora is a little less obtuse The species of this group are related by the closest resemblances of form and sculpture, so much so that they may in some cases be considered as races, or geographical varieties.
The one above described is remarkably distinct from the others, and must in all events rank as separate.
Not so perhaps with a singular female specimen collected by Capt.
Pope in New Mexico, which with the form of E. sulcipennis, exhibits an entire want of eljtral grooves, except at the sides behind the middle, where some faint traces are seen : the punctures are submuricate, and arranged in stria distinct on the back, confused at the sides ; between the rows are distant punctures as in E. obscura ; the tips are abruptly declivous, and furnished with rows of tubercles, alternately large and small, the latter corresponding to the striae of the anterior portion.
The specimen is 1-20 long, and the teeth of the anterior femora are very obtuse.
For convenience this may be called E. del eta.
Other specimens, both male and female, found in Arizona have also the form of E. sulcipennis, but the thorax is more convex, less flattened and less punctured at the sides, and more finely margined ; the grooves of the elytra are deeper, the interstices more smooth and shining, with much fewer scattered punctures ; sexual characters precisely as in E. sulcipennis.

Of nearly the same form as E. tricostata, but entirely glabrous above, though pubescent beneath: the elytra of the female are wider than the thorax, sometimes flattened, sometimes uniformly, though slightly convex ; those of the male are narrower and flattened.
The femora in both sexes are simple ; the spurs of the anterior tibiae of the female are unequal, the posterior one (the inner) is acute, the outer one is twice as long, wider and slightly obtuse.
In the male the spurs are broken, but they appear to have been less unequal in size.

Remarkable among the species of this group by the size, and by the attempt at striae of large punctures near the middle of the elytra.

The elytra are broader, mere rounded on the sides, the humeri are less broadly produced, 1858.]

This species agrees with the description ofE.
parvicollis given by Mannerheim, (Bull.

Eschscholtz does not in his decription mention that the sides of the thorax are scabrous, but adds that the base of the thorax is nearly as wide as the widest portion of the thorax, whereby the latter appears small.
A specimen from the St. Petersburg museum sent me as a type is not allied at all to this species, but rather toE.
cordata.
The smaller species of Eleodes of this division are exceedingly abundant, and seem subject to some variation.
It will be impossible to attain any definite results in the nomenclature of them until an authentic series of named specimens can be obtained by careful comparison with the types of Eschscholtz and Mannerheim.

Dr. Woodhouse announced the death, at Philadelphia^ on the 28th ult.
; of Dr. Gavin Watson, late a member of the Academy.
Dr. Leidy remarked, that while spending a few weeks during the past summer, in company with Dr. Bridges, at the residence of our fellow member Mr. S. Powel, at Newport, Rhode Island, they together had examined the neighbor[Nov. 189 ing fresh-water streams and ponds for Polyzoa.
They had the good fortune to find a species of Cristatella ; being the first discovery of this genus in America.
The locality of the polyzoon is Lily Pond, near Newport, in which it is found very abundantly^ adhering to the under side of stones forming the shores of the pond.
In the month of August, the Cristatella masses were flattened, elliptical, about half an inch in length and about two lines wide, and were translucent yellowish white.
About three rows of polyps encircled the masses.
Each polyp supported on its horseshoe-like arms seventy-two tentacles, conjoined at base by a delicate, festooned, areolated membrane.
Specimens of the Cristatella, placed in a dish of water, moved at the rate of an inch in about twenty-four hours.
The ova, or statoblasts, were only partially developed during ray stay at Newport.
The present month, Mr. Powel has sent to me fully developed specimens, accompanied with a note, in which he says, " I made an expedition to the Lil}^ Pond, and procured great numbers of Cristatella with ova.
I got upon one stone fifty-four separate masses, some of them one inch and three-quarters long and one quarter wide, of a beautiful amber color, full of ova, apparently in various stages of development."
These ova are the largest that I have seen in any genus of Polyzoa.
They are double convex lenticular, and circular, with a marginal discoidal aunulus, a little deeper on one side than on the other.
From the inner margin of the annulus spring forth about seventy anchor-like appendages, of which fifty spring from one side, and bend in a doubly geniculate manner over the outer margin of the annulus ; the remaining twenty are shorter, and diverge from the opposite side.
Breadth of statoblast, 1.152 mm., or about half a line independent of the anchors.
This American species of Cristatella is respectfully dedicated to the sister of Mr. Powel, with the name of Cristatella Id^.
From the European Cristatella mucedo^ the American species differs in habit as well as in several points of structure.
Prof. Allman, in his valuable monograph on the Polyzoa, says, that " while the greater number of the fresh-water Polyzoa lurk on the under surfaceof stones and in dark recesses, Cristatella loves to expose itself to the full light and warmth of the sun."
The polyp of C. mucedo has about eighty tentacula; and the intestine is light bluish green.
That of C. Idee has about seventy-two tentacula, and the intestine is yellowish.
The ova or statoblasts of C. mucedo are about one thirty-third of an inch broad ; those of C. Ida are about half a line.
Prof. Allman's figure of the statoblast of the former species represents the anchors as sigmoid; those of the latter species have a double elbow.
The discovery of an American Cristatella has afforded me the opportunity of comparing its statoblasts with those of Pectinatella.
The diagnosis formerly given by authors to those of Cristitella^ equally well apply to those of Pectinatella^ while the statoblasts of the two genera differ in a remarkable manner.
This is sufficiently well indicated by comparing the following description with that above given, of the statoblasts of Cristatella Mac.
The statoblast of Pectinatella magnifica is doubly convex lenticular, quadrately circular, and slightly curved, with a marginal discoidal annulus, much deeper on one side than on the other.
From the outer margin of the annulus spring forth about twelve to sixteen straightly diverging anchors.
Breadth of statoblast 0.88 mm.
by 0.8 mm., or about the third of a line.
Recently, Dr. Wm.
Spiilman, of Columbus, Mississippi, has sent to me a description, accompanied with drawings, of certain gelatinoid masses from the lakes of his vicinity, on which he desired some information.
The masses, which Dr. Spiilman observes hang from the immersed branches of plants and dead sticks, at the present time, (October,) " are from the size of a hen's egg to such as measure 15 inches long by 12 inches in diameter."
The description, draw1858.]
190 ing of the masses, and numerous specimens of statoblasts also received, are all referable to the rectinatclla onagnifica.
I bad been prepared for this announcement by repeated information of medical students from the southwestern portion of our country.
Some of them have stated they had seen these jelly-like masses even as large as a half-bushel measure.
Mr. Stimpson, the accurate naturalist, has informed me, that as early as 1850 he had detected large brain-like masses of Polyzoa attached to stones in the Middlesex canal, near Boston.
As Pectinatella, so far as my observations go, has always been found attached to branches of trees, perhaps from the difference of habit, the brain-like masses may prove to be distinct.
Dr. Leidy further exhibited drawings of a species of Fredericella, which is found in the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, near Philadelphia, and also in Lily Pond, near Newport.
He has not yet positively ascertained whether the species is different from that found in Europe.
He added, that two years since he had detected a species of Lophopus in the Schuylkill river, but he had not yet had leisure to determine its character.

Hall's 0. insculpta is an old worn specimen of it, sent by myself before we had discovered the locality for perfect specimens.
It occurs at Oxford, Ohio, about 200 ft. below the Cliff Limestone, and has a vertical range of only a few feet.

S. Navy, at Hakodadi, Island of Jesso, Japan, with notes and descriptions of new species, BY JOHN CASSIN.
During a cruise of the U. S. ship Portsmouth, Captain A. H. Foote, U. S. Navy, commanding, recently completed, a very interesting collection of birds and collections in other departments of Natural History were made by Dr. A.
A. Henderson, Surgeon, U. S. Navy, and Member of this Academy.
Mainly the birds were obtained at Hakodadi, in the Island of Jesso, the most northern ot the Empire of Japan, and in the Island of Luzon, Philippine Islands, and the collection contains so many species, little known and otherwise of high interest, that we have deemed it proper to prepare catalogues for publication.
The present paper contains birds from Hakodadi, exclusively, but we propose shortly to give a catalogue of those from the Philippines, to include also another collection recently received from the same Islands.
Though the fullest encouragement and every facility was cheerfully granted by Captain Foote, opportunities for collecting birds only presented, favorable in any considerable degree, at the two points mentioned.
The U. S. ship Portsmouth, it will be remembered, was in the Chinese Seas during the recent troubles, and it was undoubtedly most fortunate for the interests of the United States that such an accomplished and efficient officer as Captain Foote was in command and so faithfully maintained and defended the dignity of his flag and the reputation of his country.
The present collection was made at Hakodadi in October, 1857.

A single specimen in Dr. Henderson's collection is not in good plumage, but is interesting on account of its similarity in colors only to the common Passer montanus of Europe.
It is, however, different from that species in having the bill stronger and the feet much larger, and in general appears to be a more robust bird.
The toes in the present species are so much longer and thicker, that those of P. montanus^ (from France,) appear on comparison to be quite feeble.
It seems, in fact, to belong to Bonaparte's second division of the genus Passer^ (Consp.
Av.
p. 508,) though with the plumage of the type of the first division, P. montanus.
This rather singular bird is very probably meant by Pallas in Zoog.
as above cited, where he gives it as a species of eastern Siberia and probably also by Temminck and Schlegel under the name of P. inontamis.
The distinguished authors last mentioned seem, however, not to have had specimens before them The name given by Pallas very probably ought to be re-established for this species.

The only specimen that we have ever seen of a species allied to Parus palusiris of Europe, but apparently suflaciently distinct.
So far as we can judge from a very short description, it is the bird meant by the Prince Bonaparte as above cited.
In this bird the upper .parts of the body are pale ashy, (" alho-canescens,^' Bonap.)
paler than in Parus palustris and the tail is longer with all the feathers uniformly ashy brown, the edges only of the outer feathers being white.
Head above and neck behind black, throat black, under parts white, with a very pale and dull.
tinge of yellowish ashy on the abdomen and flanks.
The black of the head extends on to the neck further than usual in species having this character.
Bill rather stout.

This little bird appears to us to be of rather complex generic, or, perhaps, more properly, subgeneric relations, and would be quite as properly included in the genus Locustella as in Lutsciniopsis, and in fact bears considerable resemblance and relationship to the European Sylvia locustella.
It much resembles the preceding, having the same short wings, rounded tail, and very strong legs and long toes, but the bill is comparatively smaller.
As will be seen by the measurements given, the present bird is much smaller than the preceding, and is smaller also than S. locustella.
One specimen only in the collection made by Dr. Henderson, to whom we have dedicated this curious little species, his high position as an officer of the Medical corps of the Navy of the United States, and extensive acquirements also as a naturalist, fully justifying it, but especially his untiring energy in contributing to the ornithological collection of this Academy renders the present application of his name entirely appropriate.
The present bird does not much resemble any species enumerated by Temminck and Schlegel.

BY W. G. BINNEY.
The following Catalogue of American Terrestial Mollusks, is offered in the hope of drawing attention to the subject, and by exciting criticism, to furnish the first step towards an arrangement of the confused synonomy.
The list is necessarily incomplete, as but a small portion of the oldest States has been thoroughly searched, and an immense extent of territory remains quite unexplored.
The species of the Pacific coast north of Mazatlan, are catalogued separately.
The Mexican species will be published in a subsequent paper.
Reference is made only to authors giving a description or figure of each species.

The following extract from a letter of Mr. C. 0.
Sanford, dated Petersburg, Ya., Oct. 20th, 1858; was read.
I was much interested in the slab of sandstone (mentioned on page 177,) showing the ripple marks on its opposite sides, at right angles, or nearly so, and although I thought I could account for it, I was not willing to venture an opinion until I could have access to my books.
I send an extract from Calver, on the improvement of tidal rivers, which satisfies me that the marks were not made by currents, but by waves caused by winds.
1st.
A wind produced the ridges upon the soft bed of sand.
2d.
That a deposit of sand was made upon these ridges, which in like manner was ridged by a ^ind blowing at a different angle from the first.
One side of the slab is probably the impression of the ridges first made.
Extract from a letter loriiten by an officer in the British Navy. "
In 1838, while lying in one of H. M. ships, in the port of Santander, on the north coast of Spain, we observed, upon looking over the side at high water.
and when the water was unusually clear, that the bottom, composed of sand^ was covered by ridges running paratlel to the waves that had been on the surface during a strong breeze of two or three days' duration, but which had bean succeeded by a calm.
Our anchorage was within the harbor, and the wind off shore.
The impression it made on my mind at the time was, that as the ridges lay at right angles to the direction in which the wind had been blowing, thev were occasioned by a motion given to the water at that depth by the waves at the surface.
Our anchorage at high water (the time alluded to,) was forty feet.
I do not think that the waves, from the crest to the lowest part of the hollow could have been more than five feet, as the wind was an off shore one upon that coast.
The ridges were small, apparently not more than a foot in width, and so, not corresponding in magnitude with the waves on the surface, but only with their direction."
[Nov. On leave granted, the Report of the Biological Department for November was presented and ordered to be printed, with the Proceedings of last meeting.

Vice-President Bridges in the Chair.
Sixty-seven members present.
The following papers were presented for publication in the Proceediags: Ichthyological Notices, by Charles Grirard, M, D. Prodromus Descriptionis Animalium evertebratorum, quae in Expeditione ad Oceanum Pacificum septentrionalem, a Kepublica federata missa, Cadwaladaro Ringgold et Johanne Rodgers ducibus observavit et descripsit W. Stimpson ; pars septima, Crustacea Anomoura.
And were referred to Committees.
Mr. Wm, Parker Foulke made a statement respecting the fossil bones, shells and wood presented by him to the Academy this evening.
Passing the summer and autumn at Haddonfield, Camden County, New Jersey, Mr, Foulke learned that one of his neighbors, Mr. John E. Hopkins, while digging marl upon his farm, about twenty years ago, had found some bones.
These were described as vertebrse, and as being of large size, and very numerous.
Mr. Hopkins being young at the time of the discovery, and not specially interested in such subjects, had permitted visitors to carry away the fossils ; so that none remained in his own possession, nor could he remember the names of any of the persons by whom the vertebrae had been taken.
According to his recollection, no head had been found, nor any other bones than those of the spine, except one, which was said by him to have resembled, in general respects, a ^' shoulder blade."
It appeared, then, not improbable that upon digging around the old pit, (which was sixteen feet long and eight feet wide,) a head, or at least a portion of one containing teeth, might be obtained.
Considering the geological age of the formation upon which Haddonfield stands, and that specimens of Mosasaurus have been discovered in places not very remote from the village, there appeared sufficient motive for exploration.
Mr. Hopkins, with an intelligent appreciation of the object proposed, gave to Mr, Foulke, with prompt liberality, permission to dig in any part of the farm, and to take away whatever fossils might be thus procured.
There was some diflSculty in ascertaining the place of the old excavation.
It had been made in the bed of a narrow ravine, in which a brook flows eastwardly into the south branch of Cooper's Creek ; but the pit had long since been filled to the common level of the bed, and it was in like manner overgrown with grass, shrubs, and young trees, so as to be undistinguishable by the eye.
After conference with one of the diggers who had been employed at the time of the discovery, (whose indication proved to be inaccurate,) and after a careful survey of the vicinage by Mr. Hopkins, a party of experienced marl diggers were set at work ; and after one day's preliminary trial, the eastern side of the old pit was detected.
In conformity with Mr. Hopkins' recollection of the manner in which the vertebrÂ£e lay, the party of diggers was shifted to the western side of the old pit.
The superficial deposit overlying the marl here, was only about four feet thick; the ravine being between twenty and thirty feet deep.
At nearly four feet further depth, a thin stratum of decomposed shells was passed ; and at about two feet below this, overlying and intermixed with another stratum of shells, the workmen came upon a pile of bones â the same now before the Academy.
The total depth from the surface was between nine and ten feet.
1858.]
16 214 The marl being tenacious, great care was requisite to extricate the fossils.
With a small trowel and a knife, the bones were carefully dissected from their bed, and from one another.
A sketch was made of their position, and some measurements were taken of them, in anticipation of the contingency of their fracture in the attempt to remove them.
Several lines of transverse fracture were observable before their position was changed.
Each bone was separately transferred to a board, and thus carried from the pit, and then wrapped in a piece of coarse cloth.
Thus enveloped it was laid upon a thick bed of straw in the bottom of a cart ; and the whole were safely transported in this way, about three quarters of a mile, to Mr. Foulke's residence.
A small tooth and some fragments of a jaw were found with the other specimens.
Mr. Isaac Lea and Dr. Leidy were informed of the discovery, and they promptly visited the excavation.
Their opinion of the scientific value of the fossils justified further exploration; and the diggers were kept at work, from time to time as the weather permitted, during the month of October.
Another tooth having been accidentally turned up by Mr. Foulke near the surface of the marl which had been thrown out, the entire mass was broken up and carefully raked over ; and by this process, in two or three days, the number of teeth increased to nine, and some useful fragments of jaw were also added to the collection.
Various specimens of shells were obtained ; but their extreme friability rendered their preservation difficult.
Several pieces of wood were found.
The excavation was carried quite around the old pit, and extended so as to form a considerable area for search ; but nothing further appeared, except a few vertebrae, and small fragments of other bones, and of wood, near the margin of the old pit.
It seemed then useless to proceed, and the diggers were dismissed.
One of the workmen, having become interested in the search, kept his attention upon the subject ; and about a week afterward found, in the green marl near the White Horse tavern (about six miles southward from Haddonfield), some vertebrae, parts of long bones, and several teeth of a crocodile, believed to be of a species not heretofore found in New Jersey ; which are now in Dr. Leidy's hands for final examination.
The workman stated that, at the bottom of all the diggings, casts of cucullea are found in great quantity.
They are known at the pits by the name of "squirrel heads," from a fancied resemblance.
Two specimens accompany the crocodile bones just mentioned.
Subsequently, Drs.
Leidy and LeConte and Mr. Foulke made a short tour among green marl pits, worked for sale of marl, southward of Haddonfield.
On the road to the White Horse, they visited the large opening of Mr. Alexander Cooper, who stated that he knew of no bones being found there â certainly none during thirty years.
Near the White Horse, it was said that bones had been thrown from all the diggings.
At the extensive pit of Mr. Randall Morgan, on a south branch of Timber Creek, a short distance southward from Blackwoodtown, a curious specimen of conglomerate of terebratulae and other shells was obtained.
Bones had been recently found ; but they had been thrown away, and were lost, ^rom Mr. Charles Stevenson, in the same neighborhood, it was learned that in his pit, and that of Mr. Marshall, below Mr. Morgan's, bones had been repeatedly found, but no care was taken of them.
In fact, within the last year Mr. Stevenson had thrown some portions into the yard between his house and barn.
After a little raking, a few crocodile bones were discovered amongst leaves and dirt.
Mr. King, a blacksmith at Blackwoodtown, was said to have collected a few bones as curiosities.
Upon application being made to him, he stated that he had given, or loaned, or lost, nearly all of his stock ; but he produced from the corner of his workshop, three specimens which Dr. Leidy immediately recognised as fragments of jaw of Mosasaurus, each containing a large portion of a tooth ; the three exhibiting very clearly the mode of dentition of the animal.
These details were presented to the notice of the members, because they suggested the probability that valuable illustrations of palaeontology and geology are annually lost through the ignorance of marl diggers or the inattention of own[Dec. 215 ers of pits.
In view of the great promise of a region so near to Philadelphia, it is important that measures shall be taken to awaken in the minds of proprietors and workmen an interest in the preservation of specimens for the cabinet of the Academy.
It may be observed, upon inspection of the geological map of New Jersey, that aline drawn from the recent opening on Mr. Hopkins' farm, southwesterly in the direction of the exposure of the green sand formation, passes several miles westward of the green marl pits which were visited as just narrated.
The marl at Mr. Hopkins' is, when in the pit, dark blue approaching black, micaceous, stiff, and tenacious.
Upon free exposure to the air, it becomes, after a week or two, light bluish gray in color, and then it crumbles easily.
From its not being considered as good a fertilizer as the green marl, it has been rarely dug, of late, in that part of the country; and hence there is not an opportunity for collecting fossils, such as is furnished by the pits in the green marl.
The latter deposit is more seaward ; and hence a diminished probability of finding in it the remains of animals which lived upon land, or in the freshwater tributaries of the old ocean.
Of the two exogyra presented on behalf of Mr. Robert Hare Powel, the smaller was dug, a number of years since, from Mr. Hopkins' farm.
The larger, showing a curious peculiarity of growth, was taken more recently from a small excavation in Mr. Powel's ground, between Mr. Hopkins' and the main street.
The diagram upon the table would make clear to the members the principal localities which had been mentioned.
The hard stone containing casts of shells, apparently belonging to the tertiary period, was found at about five miles south-eastward of Allowaystown ; and was presented in behalf of Mr. Isaac H. Wood, of Haddonfield.
The sandstones on the table were not new nor rare; but they afford very good examples of the mode in which sand and gravel are converted into hard stone by a ferruginous cement.
The specimens show interesting gradations of fineness, compactness and hardness.
They came from the superficial deposit near Mr. A. Cooper's marl pit, where they lay loosely embedded.
Similar stones are used in the neighborhood for coarse building purpoees.
The bones found by Mr. Foulke, had been submitted by him to Dr. Leidy, for description ; the shells, to Mr. Lea; and the wood to Dr. Hammond.
As these gentlemen were prepared to report the results of their inspection, Mr. Foulke restricted himself to the simple introductory narrative of facts just given ; resfrving to a future occasion some observations which had occurred to him respecting the succession of cretaceous deposits in New Jersey, and the relations of and and sea during the cretaceous period.
Dr. Leidy stated that the bones, mentioned in the remarks of ^Ir.
Foulke, obtained from the marl of Mr. Hopkins' farm, near Haddonfield, New Jersey, and now exposed to the view of the Society, were those of a huge herbivorous saurian.
The animal was closely allied to the great extinct Ignanodon of the Wealden and Lower Greensand deposits of Europe ; the genus is, however, different, and for it the name of Hadrosaurus is proposed.
Besides a number of small fragments, the bones consist of twenty-eight' vertebrae, mostly with their processes broken away; a humerus, a radius and an ulna, complete ; an ilium and a pubic bone, imperfect; a femur, a tibia and a fibula; two metatarsal bones and a first phalanx, complete.
There are also in the collection nine teeth and a small fragment of the lower jaw.
The bones are ebony black, from the infiltration of iron, and are exceedingly heavy.
Their texture is firm and well preserved ; and they are neither crushed nor water rolled.
In association with them, besides the shells and wood, were found several teeth of Odontaspis and Enchodus.
Most of the specimens of teeth of the i7^^/(/ro5f?Â«rz/s appear to have belonged' to the lower jaw.
These, when unworn and perfect, are about two inches long, and of all known teeth most resemble those of the Ignanodon.
They have a demi-conoidal crown, with a lozenge-shaped enamel surface directed inwardly, and divided by a prominent median carina.
The upper borders of this surface â¢ 1858.]
216 are provided with short, transverse, tuberculated ridges.
The body of the crown outwardly is paraboloid in transverse section, and is prolonged into a laterally compressed conoidal fang.
As the teeth were worn away from the summit, their gradually expanding triturating surface sloped downward and outward.
This surface is shield-like in outline, is bordered by enamel internally, and crossed by a slightly elevated crucial ridge with diverging branchlets.
The ridge, resulting from the later ossification of the dental pulp, is harder than the surrounding dentine, and is adapted to retain a rough triturating surface.
The sides and bottoms of the teeth exhibit the impressions of lateral and inferior successors, and appear to indicate that the teeth in use, together with those more or less developed within the jaw, had a quincuncial arrangement.
Two of the specimens of teeth perhaps belong to the upper jaw.
They differ from the others in the extraordinary degree of development of the median carina of the crown.
The enamelled surface was perhaps directed in a reverse manner to that of the lower teeth; that is to say, outwardly.
It is likewise lozenge-like in outline, and tuberculated at the lower borders.
The body of the crown inwardly is half oval in section.
The fang for more than half its width is prolonged from the carina of the crown.
These teeth also exhibit the impress of successors holding the same relative position with one another as in the lower teeth.
The fragment of the lower jaw is a portion of the left dentary bone, and is three inches in depth.
It has an outer parapet wall about two inches high, with deep vertical grooves for the support of ihe teeth.
No corresponding wall appears to have existed on the inner side of the latter.
The cervical vertebrae have their bodies prominently convex in front and deeply concave behind, and would appear to indicate that Mantell was correct in assigning similar vertebrae, found in the Wealden deposits of England, to the Iguanodon.
Tbree cervical vertebras, suspected to be the third, fourth, and fifth, are two and a half inches long at the sides.
Five succeeding vertebrie, not immediately conjoining the ones just mentioned, and supposed to be anterior dorsals, likewise have convexo-concave bodies.
At the sides of the latter they are from 3 to 3|inches long, and posteriorly are 3^ inches wide.
The sides of their arch present a deep pit for the articulation of a rib ; but no articular mark is perceptible at the sides of the bodies.
Two other vertebrae, perhaps posterior dorsals, have the bodies slightly prominent in front and slightly concave behind; and they are 3 J inches long at the sides, and 4| inches wide posteriorly.
The caudal vertebrae possess articular surfaces for chevron bones ; and the specimens we possess, from diff'erent parts of the tail, give the following succession of measurements of their bodies : length 2|inches, breadth 5 inches ; length 3 inches, breadth 4i inches; length 3 inches, breadth 3 J inches; length 2| inches, breadth 2\ inches; length 2-J inches, breadth If inches.
From the gradation of size of seventeen specimens in the collection, it may be estimated that there were originally about fifty vertebrae to the tail.
This number maj^ be too great by about ten, but certainly not more.
A caudal vertebra from near the middle of the tail has its arch and spinous process complete.
The two latter together measure 11 inches long from the body, which is 4J inches deep.
The addition of a chevron bone would indicate the tail of the animal, at its middle, to have been between one and a half and two feet in depth.
The humerus is perfect, and is 23 inches long.
Its breadth at the tuberosities, between which the head projects midway, is 7 inches.
The shaft above is compressed from without inwardly; its lower part is cylindroid, and near the middle of the bone measures 9| inches in circumference.
At the condyles the transverse diameter is 5^ inches.
Only a very short and narrow medullary cavity occupies the centre of the shaft.
Both bones of the forearm are solid.
The ulna is 23 inches long, and 7 [Dec. 217 inches in circumference at the middle.
The radius is 20 inches long, and 6 inches in circumference at the middle.
A very great disproportion exists between the bones of the fore and hinder extremities.
So much is this the case, that I was at first inclined to believe thej belonged to different animals.
The disproportion is even greater than in the Iguanodon, as indicated by comparison with the remains of an individual of the latter, in the British Museum, known as the Maidstone specimen.
The ilium has its two extremities broken away, and in its present condition is 27 inches long.
Its sacral articular surface is 12 inches long by 3 inches thick.
The breadth of the bone, opposite the latter surface, is from 7 to 9 inches.
A bone, which I suspect to be the pubic, but whicU appears to correspond with that, of the Maidstone Iguanodon, described as the clavicle, is 26 inches long in its present state ; one end being broken away.
The remaining pubic extremity is lOJ inches wide.
The thigh bone is 40 inches long ; its breadth at the head and adjoining trochanter is 9 inches ; its breadth at the condyles is 8 inches ; and the antero-posterior diameter of the internal condyle is 10 inches.
The shaft is quadrate, and provided at its middle portion internally with a large trochanter.
The circumference of the shaft just above the latter is 17 inches ; just below it, 15 inches.
The condyles in front enclose a large foramen terminating a groove descending from the shaft.
Posteriorly, at the bottom of the intervening notch, they enclose a smaller foramen.
The medullary cavity is of large size, and extends about half the length of the shaft through its middle portion.
The tibia is 36} inches long ; its breadth at the upper part is 11 inches ; and its breadth below is 10 inches.
Its shaft is narrow and cylindroid at the middle, where it measures 11| inches in circumference.
From this position it rapidly expands towards the two extremities of the bone.
The medullary cavity is very short and narrow.
The two metatarsal bones are of robust proportions and are each about 11 inches long.
The proximal jyhalajix of a toe is 6 inches long, and 5|: inches broad at base.
If we estimate the number of vertebrae of the trunk of Hadrosaurus to have been the same as in the recent Crocodile and Iguana ; the number of sacral vertebrae to have been the same as in the Iguanodon ; and the number of caudal vertebrae to have been fifty ; the whole number of vertebrae would have been eighty.
A calculation of the length of the specimens of vertebrae in our possession, with a proper allowance of separation by intervertebral fibro-cartilages, and an addition of two and a half feet as an estimate of the length of the head, would give, as the total length of the animal, about twenty-five feet.
The great disproportion of size between the fore and back parts of the skeleton of Hadrosaurus, leads me to suspect that this great extinct herbivorous lizard may have been in the habit of browsing, sustaining itself, kangaroo-like, in an erect position on its back extremities and tail.
As we, however, frequently observe a great disproportion between the corresponding parts of the body of recent and well known extinct saurians, without any tendency to assume such a position as that mentioned, it is not improbable that Hadrosaurus retained the ordinary prostrate condition, progressing in the manner which has been suspected to have been the case in the extinct batrachian of an earlier period, the Labgrinthodoti.
Hadrosaurus was most probably amphibious ; and though its remains were obtained from a marine deposit, the rarity of them in the latter leads us to suppose that those in our possession had been carried down the current of a river, upon whose banks the animal lived.
Occasionally uncharacteristic fragments of huge bones have been found in the green sand of New Jersey, (of which we have several in the collection of the Academy,) which I suspect to belong to Hadrosaurus.
One of these specimens, exposed to the view of the members, indicates a much larger individual than the one whose remains have been presented this evening.
1858.]
218 The species I would respectfully propose to dedicate to our fellow member W. Parker Fouike, tban whom none ' f our number is more zealous in the advancement of the great objects of this Academy.
The name of the great extinct saurian will then appear as Hadrosaurus Foulkii.
Mr. Lea remarked that the members must all feel under great oblig ations to their fellow m 'inber, W. Parker Fouike, Esq., for the conct-ption, the industry and perseverance which he has brouglit to the exliutnaiiuu of thesis various reliques of a former state of existence of orgmst^ms, tot^illy different from any which now live on the surface of the earth ; for there no longer now remains a single creation wiiich had life during the whole of the Cretaceous period.
With the true spirit of scientific investigation he has en-ibLd geologists to examine tbese important remains of a former world, and with equal liberality he has placed the whole in the possession of the Academy.
It was with very great pleasure that Mr. Lea assisted, with Dr. Leidy for a few days, by the invitation of their friend, during the progress of his successful labors.
The result has been that one of the most interesting fossil animals on record has been ^dded to the fauna of this period, the bones of which have just been so happily illustrMted by Dr. Leidy.
There wereals" numerous genera and species of Mollusca, as well as coniferous plants added to our p^laBontology and fossil botany.
Geological science is indebted to our late fellow member, Prof. Vanuxem, for the identification ol the m<Ml beds of New Jersey and Delaware with the Cretaceous group of Europe, but it was not then known in either country that there were so many subdivisions ut the group, and the exact parallelism of the green sand was not attempted to be traced.
While studying in Paris, under the instruction of Brogui irt,hp was led to the conclu .
ion, from his previous exanination of man}"of the^e " marl pits," with Mr. Lea, that the moUusca were the same which belonged to the upper beds of Brogniart's " Pelagiques."
At that early period of our geological history, when he was (examining the Paris basin, he was convincei, in 1818, ihat the alluvial of Maclure consisted of -'secondary, tertiary, and alluvial masses."
Subsequently, in January, 1828, his notes were published in the Journal of this Academy,* and he gave a tabular view of the *â¢ relative geological position" of the secondary, tertiary, and alluvial formations of the United States.
He also defined their " geographical position," and stated that " this bed, (green sand), vi^as argillaceous, and contained greenish particles analog uis to tliose which are found in the green sand, or chalk, of Europe," and th;it it was "characterised by six genera, viz., Terebratula, GryphiBU, Ezogyr 1^ Ammnnitps, Baruliies and BeLemnites.'"
These views of Professor Vanuxem were subsequently confirmed in various papers, al-o published in the Academy's Journal, by Dr. Morton, who, in his â ' Synopsis of Organic Remains," published in 1834, page 7, says that " Mr. Vanuxem was the first io detect the analogy between this deposit (Ferruginous sand,) and tne chalk formation of Europe."'
Other geologists in various papers and state repoi ts have, by their developments, confirmed the opinions of Prof. Vanuxem, and from year to year new explorations have tended to demonstrate the vast extent of the Cretaceous Formation in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains.
The Cretaceous Formation commences at Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts, is largely developed in New Jersey, and is found in Dela ware, Maryland, Virginia and the Carolinas.
In Georgia, it is more largely d^velojied.
Here, sweeping round the inferior Strata, the Primary, Silurian, and Carboniferous masses, it continues in a very enlarged band in a northerly direction, through Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, to near the mouth of the Ohio River.
Crossing the Mississippi River, it descends to the south-west, through Arkansas, where on the upper waters of the Red River it expands to the n rih, thi oiigh Nebraska Territory, far into the British Possessions east of the Kocky MounVol.

[Dec. 219 tains, embracing the head waters of the River Saskatchewan.
* To the west, from Red River, it extends to and beyond Santa Fe, embracing the head waters of the Colorado, and stretching north-west, reaches the head waters of the Columbia, as well as those of the Missouri River.
Following a south-western direction from Red River through Texas, it crosses the Rio G-raude into New Leon, and thence south through St. Luis Potosi, it passes indefinitely into Mexico.
In all the great extent of this formation, there is evidence of the cretaceous period^ while most of the species differ from our eastern fauna, as the lithological characters do in the rocks and sediments.
In New Jersey, the green sand beds are but slightly calcareous, the limestone lying above having about 80 per cent, of lime.
In North and South Carolina, it is, according to Pro.
Tuomey, " 25 to 30 per cent, of the mass," but in Alabama it is " highly calcareous."
This vast extent of a simultaneous deposit of this kind, is calculated to excite the greatest interest, when we consider how much it affects our agricultural prosperity ; and in a geological point of view, it has received the attention of many of our ablest investigators.
Prof. Vanuxem, in the first place, had in view, the division of McClure's " alluvial," and in his paper he gives a table, dividing it into secondary, tertiary, and alluvial.
To these he gave seven subdivisions â two only to the secondary, No.
1, being "Marl of New Jersey and Delaware," which he refers to the" green sand, or chalk of Europe."
Dr. Morton, in his " Synopsis of Organic Remains," (page 13,) in 1834, six years subsequently, gives in a table the same three grand divisions, with a difference in the subdivisions, assigning the name of Ferruginous sand" to the lower division in which Prof. Vanuxem had continued the name of " Marl of New Jersey," the equivalent of" green sand, or chalk of Europe."
Subsequently, in June, 1835, in an appendix, page 89, he separates the "Cretaceous deposits of America" into three divisions, the " Upper, Media!, and Lower."
In 1840, Prof. H. D. Rogers published his Report on the Geology of New Jersey, in which he separated the cretaceous group into five divisions, under the name of " the upper secondary series, embracing the green sand formation."
1.
A group of sands and clays, extremely white and pure, 2.
A mixed group, consisting of green sand, alternating with and occasionally replaced by layers of a blue, sandy, micaceous clay, the so-called "green sand formation. '
3.
A yellowish, granular limestone, having a profusion of organic remains.
4.
A yellow, very ferruginous coarse sand, with some fossil shells of the green sand formation.
5.
A coarse, brown, ferruginous sandstone, sometimes passing into a conglomerate.
Subsequently, in Johnston's Physical Atlas, 1855, under the name of "Newer Mesozoic," he continues these divisions, the whole thickness of which he presumes to be a thousand feet.
Prof. Tuomey, in the tables of his geological survey of South Carolina, in 1848, calls the New Jersey deposits " upper green sand;" those of South Carolina, " the gault;" those of Alabama, tbe lower green sand, equivalent to the Neocomien of the French geologists.
In 1854, Messrs. Hall and Meek made a communication to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, on some fossils from the Cretaceous Formation of Nebraska.
This they divide into five sections.
5.
Arenaceous clay passing into argillo-calcareous sandstone.
4.
Plastic clay, the principal fossiliferous bed of the upper Missouri.
3.
Calcareous marl, containing Ostrea congesta^ &c. 2.
Clay containing few fossils. ]

Warren and Dr. Hayden, with explanations by the latter who has done so much for the geology of the Western Territories ; also the excellent map of Hall k Lesley, in Major Emory's Report on the Mexican Boundary Survey, and Prof. Hall's ]{eport of the Geology of the Boundary in the same volume.

220 In 1855, Mr. Marcou published, in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of France, an account of the Geology of the United States, in the cretaceous division of which, (page 70,) after giving to Prof. Vanuxem the credit of being the first to detect this group in the United States, he says that it may be divided provisionally into " three great groups," which have been named in Europe, 1st, le Neocomien ; 2d.
le gres vert superieur et la craie marneuse ; 3d, la craie blanche.
In March, 1856, Mr. Meek and Dr. Hayden, published their section of the Cretaceous formation of Nebraska, in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences, which they republished more fully in the following November, also in the Academy's Proceedings.
5.
Gray and yellowish arenaceous clays, with great numbers of marine mollusca, few land plants and bones of Mosasaurus.
4.
Bluish and dark plastic clay, containing numerous marine Mollusca.
3.
Lead gray calcareous marl, with scales of fishes.
Ostrea congesta, Inoceramusj &c. 2.
Dark gray laminated clay, with scales of fishes, small ammonites, &c. 1.
Heavy bedded yellowish sandstone, with water-worn lignite.
This formation they say may not belong to the cretaceous system.
Prof. Hall in his Geological Report, August, 1856, connected with Major Emory's Mexican Boundary Survey, gives an excellent table prepared by Prof. G. H. Cooke, of the New Jersey Survey, which divides the whole of this system in New Jersey into eight members, which may be thus suscinctly given : â 8, Green Sand, 3d or upper bed.

2.
Dark colored clay â Fossil wood, no animal remains.

In May 1857, Mr. Meek and Dr. Hayden, in the Proceedings of the Academy, continued their valuable papers on the Tertiary and Cretaceous formation of Nebraska, and gave a table of equivalents with the New Jersey deposits, and Dr. Hayden in June of the same year made a communication entitled " Explanations of a second edition of a geological map of Nebraska and Kansas," in which the whole series of formations is reviewed, including the cretaceous system.
It is a very important matter in discussing these organic remains to ascertain, as nearly as possible, the horizon on which this particular formation would stand in regard to its parallelism with those of Europe, where so much has been written on the subject of the various members of the Cretaceous group.
Sir Charles Lyell says, that the New Jersey " strata consist chiefly of green sand and green marl, with an overlying coraline limestone of a pale yellow color, and the fossils, on the whole, agree most nearly with those of the upper European series from the Maestricht beds to the gault inclusive."
^' Professor Rogers in his New Jersey Report, does not seem to agree with this idea ; he " does not regard these strata as the equivalents in the strict sense of the word, of the green sand formation, so called, of Europe" (page 178).
"Nor are we able," he says, " positively to decide, merely by the relationship of the genera, whether the cretaceous period embraces both the commencement and termination of the American green sand series" (page 179).
M. D'Orbigny f considers the chalk formation of North America to belong to * Manual, third edition, page224.
t Cours Elementaire, page 671.
[Dec. 221 his " etage senonien" (the upper chalk of Morris) and not to the "gres verts," as supposed by Dr. Morton and others.
Dr. Mantell consideied that the teeth of the Mosasaurus, found in the green sand formation of New Jersey, described by Dr. Harlan, were in every respect analogous to those of the Maestricht reptile, and that the deposit was equivalent to the Maestricht bed.
The Blackdown green sand of Dr. FittonJ has in its fossil mollusca a very strong resemblance to our green sand fossils, and as D'Orbigny makes this formation an equivalent to his Cenomanien, there is some evidence that the New Jersey green sand may be on the same horrizon; for according to D'Orbigny's tables the genus Belemnites ceases with the Cenomanien, and we have abundance of that genus in our green sand formation.
If he be correct as to the decadence of the Cephalopoda, then we could not place this formation higher up in the series than his Cenomanien, which is the " Glauconie crayeuse " of Brogniart, found at Cap le Heve in France, the Blackdown green sand of Fitton and the Upper green sand of Mantell in the south of England.
Under all the information, we have, however, from the various investigations made by so many distinguished geologists, T think the evidence is in favor of D'Orbigny's opinion, that the green sand formation, from which these fossil remains were exhumed, belong to his Senonien, but it may prove upon further examination to be a little lower ia the Cretaceous series.
That portion of the grey micaceous clay at Haddonfield, in which the Mollusca^ all marine, were generally found, was some ten feet from the surface of the soil.
The declination of the layer is very gentle and towards the south east.
The bones and coniferous wood were so near or interspersed with the shells as to tend to prove that they must have lived in the vicinity of the shores which the Mollusca inhabited, for these show that they were deposited in a sediment totally and completely at rest.
The most tender and delicate forms remain without abrasion, and usually, in the case of the bivalves, the two valves are attached.
The great tenacity, however, of the clay, and the extreme tenderness of the shells, render it almost impossible to get out perfect specimens, and when they come under the action of the atmosphere, and become desiccated, the calcareous matter crumbles to pieces, the base membrane composing the animal portion of the shell having been previously entirely absorbed.
I propose here to give a hasty list of the genera which were collected, reserving for a future time, when more at leisure, the specific diflFerences of those which are new.
It will be observed that the Lamellibranchia greatly prevail over the Gasteropoda.

Dr. Hammond observed in relation to the fragments of fossil wood found in the same locality as the bones and shells described this evening by Dr. Leidy and Mr. Lea, that he had submitted them to a careful examination, the details of which might prove of interest to the Academy.
Upon inspecting the pieces of this wood placed upon the table, it will be perceived that they are all of an intensely black color, but differ greatly in degree of hardness.
One specimen is so soft as to crumlble readily on the slightest handling; whilst another is dense and hard, and capable of receiving a high polish.
Several of the fragments exhibit teredo perforations, a circumstance of considerable interest.
These perforations are so completely filled with sulphuret of iron that casts of them are readily obtained.
All the fragments are more or less im1858.]
X strata below the Chalk.
222 pregnated with this mineral.
In some parts the organic tissue has been entirely * removed, and nodules of the sulphuret have taken its place ; in others the mineral has entered the cells and tubes of the wood, leaving these of their natural forms.
Occasionally perfect casts of the cells are found detached from the tissue when the specimen is mounted in Canada balsam.
It was of course highly desirable that these woods should be submitted to microscopical examination.
He found, however, upon trial that it was impossible to cut satisfactory sections without removing the sulphuret of iron.
This was done by macerating pieces of the wood in dilute chlorhydric acid.
After this process they were readily cut into sections with a suitable knife, or ground down till the requisite degree of tenuity was obtained.
Sections thus obtained when placed under the microscope showed conclusively that the wood was of the coniferous family of plants.
For some time Dr. H. was under the impression that one fragment belonged to an entirely different class.
This idea arose from the fact that from an examination of eight or ten vertical sections none of the characteristic pits or cells could be perceived, nor any indication of the existence of medullary rays.
Finally, however, he obtained a section which exhibited both very clearly, and a transverse section which previously he was unable to cut, positively determined it to be of the same character as the other pieces.
Some cause or other, probably the carbonizing process, had entirely destroyed the pits which had existed ; a fact of some importance in investigations of this nature.
All the fragments appear to belong to the same species of conifer, and as far as Dr. H. could judge do not differ essentially in microscopic characters from the pines which now grow on the locality, Mr. T. Edwards Clark had kindly given him some specimens of a fossil wood described by linger, which in many respects resembles that referred to, the pits being absent from a large portion of the tisgue.

BY CHARLES GIRARDj M. D. I.
Those interested in the study of American animals, and of fishes in particular, will hear with interest, of the discovery recently made, of a representative of the Myxinoid family on the north-eastern coast of this continent.
It belongs to the genus 3Iyxine^ so carefully and skilfully investigated by Joh.
Miiller.
It is the more interesting to comparative anatomists, as it typifies the lowest grade of the vertebrated plan of structure.
The species which we allude to closely resembles the European one, 31. glutinosa; like it, it is an inhabitant of a rather high latitude, and its habits or mode of living are quite as little understood.
The only specimens that were ever found were collected by my friend, W. Stimpson, who gave most of his specimens to Prof. Agassiz, reserving but one, which he deposited in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.
The latter specimen is eleven inches and a half long : the thoracic region alone is subcylindrical ; the abdominal and caudal regions being quite compressed and somewhat tapering.
The dorsal fin begins somewhat posteriorly to the branchial apertures as a mere fold of the skin, increasing very slightly in elevation towards the spear-shaped tail, being highest posterior to the vent.
The latter, in the form of an elongated split, is situated nearly an inch and a half from the tip of the tail where the anal fin meets with the dorsal, of which it has both the aspect and development.
A membranous fold or abdominal fin, a good deal more developed than the dorsal one just alluded to, may be observed all along the abdominal region, from the vent to the branchial apertures, being continuous with the anal fin, properly so called, the vent itself not affecting materially its continuity, since it is partly situated between a double fold at the origin of the anal fin.
As regards the branchial apertures themselves, the left one is larger than the right, which is placed somewhat in advance and sideways of the left; they are situated about three inches from the apex of the snout.
The double series of abdominal mucous pores (one on either side), are conspicuous upon the removal of the slimy investment; the pores being about an eighth of an inch apart.
The head is small, continuous with the body ; its anterior aspect is shelving inwardly downwards, the snout being subconical, at the apex of which may be observed four subequal tentacles closely grouped together, directed upwards and inserted, two on either side, upon the very edge of the spiracle which they seem to protect, together with a small flap at its posterior margin.
The buccal aperture is anterior, below the declivity of the snout; it is divided into two parts by a lateral convoluted lip.
the upper part being subtriangular or subcordiform, the lower part transverse and elongated ; its lower periphery is rumpled.
The third pair of tentacles is the largest of all, and inserted, one on either side, near the upper and outer edge of the convoluted lateral lip just alluded to.
It hangs downwards like the fourth pair, which is the smallest and rather inconspicuous, inserted near the inner and lower edge of the same convoluted lip, over the lovrer part of the buccal aperture.
Thus the eight tentacles constitute four pairs : two rostral pairs presiding over the spiracle ; and two buccal pairs presiding over the mouth, one at the upper part, the other at the lower.
The palatine tooth is slender and elongated.
The four rows of lingual teeth are composed each of seven sublanceolated and acute teeth, much larger in the interior than in the posterior rows.
They are very crowded and inclined backwards or rather inwards ; the anterior row overlapping the base of the posterior one.
The color is of a uniform reddish brown or chestnut tint, somewhat lighter beneath than above.
The membranous fold along the abdomen being whitish.
The head and anterior aspect of the snout, tentacles and mouth, are whitish also.
From the foregoing remarks it is easy to perceive that we have on the Ameri1858.]
224 can coast a distinct species of the genus Myxine, chiefly to be distinguished from its European analogue, by the external aspect of the snout, and buccal aperture, the insertion and proportional development of the tentacles, the form of the body, and by the presence of a membraneous fin-like expansion along the abdomen.
To distinguish it henceforwards we propose calling it M. limosa.
It was collected in great abundance on muddy bottoms, off the island of Grand Manan, Bay of Fundy.
by fifty fathoms of depth.

Sometime during the month of September last, a "giant herring," as it was called by fishermen, was caught off Long Island ; its total length being five fe^t, and its weight forty-seven pounds.
The trophy was brought to New Haven, where, after a preliminary survey, the prize was cut into pieces, and sold for the table.
My friend Wm.
H. Dougal, of Georgetown, D. C, well known as an artist of the first order, happening to be at New Haven at the time, and struck at the beauty of a fish, which he had never seen before, drew up an accurate outline of its body and fins, counted the rays of the fins, and the scales of the lateral line, preserving at the same time a few scales taken upon various regions of the body.
With these materials on hand, and which we owe to his friendship, we have been enabled to refer this fish, not only to its family and proper genus, but its specific characters to a certain extent could likewise be analysed.
In 1846, Valenciennes withdrew the genera Ulops and Megalops from the herring family {Chipeidce)^ in which they were formerly included, and proposed to erect for them the family of Elopidce.
The genus Megalops was framed by Comraerson upon a species of the Indian Ocean, the history of which got interwoven with one from the West Indies, until Valenciennes established their specific difference, callirg the former M. indicus, and the latter 31. atlaniicus.
It is to be regretted that the West Indian fish is not more fully described; Valenciennes description being brief and comparative with that of the East Indian species.
It is nevertheless sufficient to establish the fact that the " giant herring" brought to New Haven, has a more elongated and subfusiform body, a more elongated head, an eye so much smaller that it never could have suggested the generic name of Big-Eye {Megalopis).
The ventral fins are also inserted more in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal fin.
The latter is subtriangular and rather small, its posterior elongated ray not extending as far as the base of the caudal ; whilst the anal is long and very low, deeply imarginated upon its lower edge, which has the shape of an open crescent, the posterior ray being elongated and extends as far as the rudimentary rays at the lower lobe of the caudal.
The formula of the rays is: D 13 ; A 24 ; C 20 ; V9; P 14.
The rudimentary rays of the caudal not being taken into account, the number given to that fin appears a good deal smaller than in the other species of the genus, when in reality it is identical.
The scales are deeper than long, rounded off, scalloped upon their anterior margin, and undulated upon the upper, posterior and lower margins.
Fifty of them were counted in the lateral line.
Three or four radiating furrows may be observed upon their anterior section only.
A silvery tint prevails all over the body and head ; the dorsal region, however, assuming a much darker hue than the middle of the flanks and the belly.
The coloration is nearly alike in all the species of this genus.
Frcm the characters alluded to, we infer the existence of a species hitherto undescribed, allied to M. atlaniicus, and for which we propose the name of if.
elongains.
It is probable that its habitat is the gulf of Mexico, and that the specimen caughtoff Long Island is a strayed individual that has followed the gulf stream on a northwards journey.

Since my report upon the Fishes of the U. S. P. R. R. Explorations and Surveys has passed through the press, new facts relating to the history of the salmons of the Columbia River have come to our knowledge, calling for various [Dec. 225 rectifications of sj'nonymy.
The species which is figured and described under the name of Fario gairdneri is not the Salmo gairdneri of Sir John Richardson.
Nor does it appear to be any of the other species recorded in the " Fauna Boreali Americana."
To distinguish it henceforwards from its congeners we will call it Fario neivberrii, or else Salmo newberrii^ just as it may suit systematic writers.
It is sufficient for the present to refer to the description alluded to above.
My friend Dr. Geo.
Suckley, who has devoted much time in studying the manners and habits of the Salmonidae of Uregon and Washington Territories, being now engaged on a work upon that family, I leave the rest of the subject with him, without further comment upon the specimens which he has himself collected, IV.
In that same Report upon the Fishes of the TJ.
S. P. R. R. Explorations and Surveys we have instituted the genus Tlialeichthys upon a species of Salmonid which we had at first glance referred to the genus Osmerus.
In treating of its characters, comparatively with both Osmerus and Argentina^ to which genera it is closely allied, we omitted accidentally to compare it with the genus Mallotus, to which it bears some affinities, but from which it however differs by a more anterior position of the dorsal and ventral fins, by its small and lanceolated pectorals, and by the absence of maxillar teeth.
As to the species referred to under the name of Thaleichthys stevensi, a further examination having shown its identity with Salmo {Mallotus?)
pacificus of the "Fauna Boreali Americana/' it is henceforwards to be designated under the name of Thaleichthys pacificus.

Eemarks on the lower Cretaceous beds of Kansas and Nebraska, together with descriptions of some new species of Carboniferous fossils from the valley of Kansas river.
BY F. B. MEEK AND E, V. HAYDEN.
The Cretaceous system as developed in Nebraska, is clearly divisible into five distinct formations, which have, for the sake of convenience, been numbered 1, 2, 3, &c., from the base upwards.
Although at first entertaining some doubts as to whether No.
1, or the lowest formation, might not be older than Cretaceous, we always placed it provisionally, in our published sections, in the Cretaceous system.
More recently, after a careful review of the subject, we became satisfied from the modern affinities of numerous dicotyledonous leaves found in this formation, that we hazarded little in regarding it as a settled question that it could not be older than Cretaceous, and so expressed ourselves in our paper read before the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, March, 1858.
The reference of this formation to the Cretaceous, however, was not without some exceptions generally admitted, for Professor Jules Marcou, in his work on the " Geology of North America," page 143, refers it to the New Red Sandstone, and in a subsequent publication,he places it in the Jurassic ; while some investigators in this country also inclined to the opinion that it must be Triassic.
In the midst of these conflicting opinions, although satisfied we were right, we wished, in order to remove all doubts from the minds of others, to have the opinion of some good authority in fossil botany, (a department of palseontolo*]N"otes pour server a une description geologique des Montagues Rochenses, page 20.
[Dec. 257 gy to which we have given little attention,) respecting the fossil leaves onwhic-h we mainly based our views in regard to the age of this formation.
Consequently, we sent outline sketches of a few of them to Professor Oswald Heer,* the distinguished authority in fossil botany at Zurich, Switzerland, informing him they were from a formation we regarded as Cretaceous and requesting him to let us know to what genera and geological epoch he would refer them.
This letter was sent to Professor Heer in August last, before we Btarted to Kansas, and on our return, in the latter part of October, we were disappointed at finding no reply from him.
After waiting some days longer, and receiving no answer from Professor Heer, we concluded our letter had either failed to reach him, or that he was unwilling to express an opinion based upon mere sketches of the leaves ; consequently we submitted the whole to Dr. Newbury, who had then returned to Washington, and in whose opinion on this subject we have the fullest confidence.
After examining the specimens, Dr. Newbury gave us a written statement bearing date Nov. 12, containing a list of the genera to which he had referred the leaves, together with some interesting remarks and generalizations, in which he expressed the opinion that they are certainly Cretaceous, some of them belonging to genera peculiar to that epoch, and that the whole belong to more highly organized plants than anything known in the Triassic or Jurassic flora.
Knowing as we did that the rocks from which these plants were obtained, â beyond all doubt, â hold a position beneath, at least, eight hundred feet of Cretaceous strata, containing great numbers of Ammonites, Scaphites, Baculiies, Â«f-c., it of course never once occurred to us that any person might suppose it Tertiary.
About the thirteenth of November we sent on to the American Journal of Science, a communication containing Dr. Newbury's list of the genera to which he had referred our plants, with some extracts from his remarlcs, all of which will appear in the January number of that Journal.
Some two or three weeks after we had corrected the last proof of this paper, we received (13th of Dec.) a letter from Professor Heer, bearing date of Nov. 20, in which he informed ws that our letter had reached him at a late date, in consequence of his absence from home, and that after his return, other engagements had prevented him from replying sooner.
In this letter Professor Heer, in accordance with our request, sent us a list of the genera, as near as it was possible for him to make them out from hastily drawn sketches, and also kindly furnished brief diagnoses of the species,!
stating at the same time that although one of the outlines resembles a Cretaceous genus (Credneria,) the nervation being obscure, and the others being more like Tertiary forms than anything known in the Cretaceous of the old world, he was inclined to the opinion that they are Tertiary.
Along with Professor Heer's letter, we also received a printed pamphlet, entitled " Letters on some points of the Geology of Texas, New llexico, Kansas and Nebraska; addressed to Messrs. F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, by Jules Marcou."
In this pamphlet Professor Marcou quotes Professor Heer's conclusions in regard to our fossil plants, and expresses the opinion that No.
1, of the Nebraska section, is both Miocene and Jurassic, or in other words, that we have included in it strata belonging to each of these two widely different geological epochs.
Having a very high regard for Professor Heer's opinions on any question in fossil botany, where he has had an opportunity to examine the specimens themselves, or to study good figures and descriptions, we are quite sure, had the whole collection been submitted to him, instead of mere sketches of a few of the species, his opinion would have been very dilferent.
At any rate, we can assert with the fullest confidence that it is absolutely impossible that this formation, or any part of it, can be Tertiary, for we know it passes, as already stated, beneath at least eight hundred feet of Cretaceous strata.
This is not mere conjecture, nor an inference drawn from having seen this formation under cir* Our friend Dr. Newberry was then in INew Mexico.

1858.]
258 cumstances leading us to suppose from the dip of the strata, that it must pass beneath the Cretaceous if continued in a given direction at the same angle of inclination, but from the fact that it has actually been seen, directly beneath the other Cretaceous rocks, not merely at one place, and by one observer, but by several persons at numerous localities.
In order to satisfy others we are not mistaken in this, we will give a few of the many facts in our possession, bearing on this question.
In the first place, we would remark that the farthest point towards the south at which we have seen this formation, is near Smoky Hill river, in Kansas, latitude 38*^ 30' north, and longitude 97Â° 30' west.
Here we found it forming the upper part of sevetal isolated elevations known as the " Smoky Hills," at an altitude of about 1200 feet above the Missouri at Fort Leavenworth.
At this locality, however, we saw no rocks overlying it, and consequently have no stratigraphical evidence that it is the same rock seen by us at other localities under Cretaceous beds ; but our lithological and palaeontological evidence is quite conclusive on this point, for this rock in color, composition, and all other respects, is undistinguishable from No.
1, of the Nebraska section, as seen near the mouth of Big Sioux river on the Missouri, and contains numerous fossil leaves, some of which are identical with those occurring in No.
1, at the last mentioned localities.
Amongst these leaves Dr. Newberry has also identified at least one genus (^Ettingshausiania) peculiar to the Cretaceous system.
Bearing in mind that all the rocks here have a gentle but uniform inclination or dip to the north west ; and that the formation under consideration consists of red and yellowish sandstones, and various colored clays, with generally more or less impure lignite and ferruginous concretions, we will be prepared to recognize it at lower and lower elevations as we proceed northward.
Without undertaking to mention in detail the intermediate exposures, we willpass northward at once to localities where it has been seen beneath Cretaceous rocks by three different observers at various times ; this is near the Kansas and Nebraska line â latitude 40Â° north, and in the vicinity of 97*=> of west longitude.
Here at an elevation of about seven hundred feet above the Missouri at Fort Leavenworth, or some five hundred feet below the level of the exposures mentioned at the Smoky Hills, our deceased friend, Mr. Henry Pratten, saw near Wyeth's creek, in 1853, the following exposures in descending order ; 1st.

5 A short distance west of this exposure Dr. J. G. Cooper informs us he saw outcrops of a red sandstone in the valleys at about the same elevation ; and above this, exposures of dark gray laminated clay answering exactly the description of No.
2, of the Nebraska section, while above the latter, near the tops of the hills, he met with outcrops of light colored limestone containing numerous casts of Inoceramus.
At other localities not far to the southwest of the foregoing, Mr. Hawn saw exposures of light colored limestone forty-five feet in thickness, containing great numbers of Inoceramus which we referred, from specimens sent by him, to /.

* Below this there was a slope of twenty-seven feet in which he saw no exposures, while still lower he observed outcrops of dark ferruginous and yellow sandstone, and various colored clays with impressions of leaves * It is with some donbt we have referred this species to I. problematicus ; it is the same species described by Dr. Schiel in the second volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, pyge 108, plate 3, figure 8.
It is rather longer on the hinge than is common in I. problematicue, from which it may be distinct.

[Dec. 259 resembling, as he supposed, those of oaks and willows.
(See his section published by us in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, May, 1857.)
Proceeding northward from the last mentioned localities, we find on reaching the Loup fork of Platte river, near the eastern limits of the Pawnee reservation, outcrops of the light colored Inoceramus beds already mentioned, (No.
3, Nebraska section,) near the water's edge ; and at the mouth of Loup fork, on the Platte, the red sandstone No.
1, so often referred to, crops out near the river margin, v/hile the Lioceramus beds are seen in the bluffs above it.
Going down the Platte in a direction nearly contrary to the dip of the strata, we find this sandstone rising up so as to form near the mouth of Elk Horn river, bluffs some sixty feet in height.
Here it seems to rest directly upon Carboniferous rocks.
Continuing on down the Platte, we find this red and yellow sandstone rising higher and higher in the hills until we come within five or six miles of the Missouri, where it is seen with its base elevated near sixty feet above the Platte; and there are probably outlines of it between that point and the Missouri at greater elevations.
So that we here find the same formation which at Smoky Hill river is elevated about twelve hundred feet above the level of the Missouri at Fort Leavenworth, and seven hundred feet above the same horizon near Little Blue river, has by the gradual north-western dip of the strata, sunk to within about one hundred feet of the Missouri at the mouth of the Platte.
* Ascending the Missouri from the localities just mentioned, we see occasional exposures of the upper Carboniferous rocks, which gradually sink lower and lower until they pass beneath the river near Florence, to be succeeded by the reddish and yellow sandstones, &c., of No.
1, â (Nebraska section.)
Above this, occasional exposures of this formation are seen with its characteristic fossil leaves, â¢along the river; and at several localities, some thirty miles below the mouth of Big Sioux river, it forms perpendicular escarpments of yellowish sandstone rising from the water's edge to an elevation of about eighty feet ; while at a higher point, back on the summits of the Hills, the same calcareous beds are seen, containing Inoceramus problematicus.
Here at a quarry in the sandstone (formation No.
1,) some twenty feet above the level of the river, one of us (Dr. H.) collected a large number of fossil leaves, some of which are identical with species found by us in this rock at the Smoky Hill locality already mentioned.
The sketches of leaves sent by us to Professor Heer were mostly drawn from specimens collected at this locality.
At the mouth of Big Sioux river a low bluff of this formation, not more than fifteen or twenty feet in height, is seen, and on the hills back a little from the river at a higher elevation the same Inoceramus bed crops out at several places, and is used for making lime.
At another locality, about eight or ten miles up the Big Sioux river, which comes in from the north west, one of us (Dr. H.) saw No.
1, containing its characteristic fossil leaves, directly beneath No.

260 Oae of the sketches of a long lanceolate leaf, like some of the existing species of Salix, sent by us to Prof. Heer, was drawn from a specimen collected, from one of the lower sandstones here.

11.)
only five feet above the water's edge, and immediately overlaid by No.
2, of the Nebraska section, containing its characteristic species of Ammonites ; and directly over the latter, he saw No.
3, containing Inoceramus Prohlematicus.
* At this locality he also found in No.
1 some of the same fossil leaves characterizing it at the other places already mentioned.
On ascending the Missouri, above the last named locality, formations No.
2, 3, 4 and 5 are seen to sink at the same gradual uniform rate of dip, in regular succession, beneath the level of the Missouri ; so that on reaching Heart river, we find the top of No.
5 nearly down on a level with the water's edge, and a short distance above that locality it passes out of sight, to be succeeded by the Gceat Tertiary Lignite basin of the upper Missouri, which overlaps it on the hills along the river for some distance below.
From the foregoing statement, we think it will be clearly understood, that formation No.
1 of the Nebraska section holds a position beneath the other cretaceous deposits of that region ; while the occurrence in it of highly organized angiosperm dicotyledonous plants proves that it cannot be older than Cretaceous.
It may be argued, however, that it may in part be Cretaceous and part Tertiary, or at any rate that some of these leaves may have been obtained from overlying Tertiary beds which we have confounded with the Cretaceous below.
This, however, is impossible, simply because specimens of nearly all the species found at the varions localities, have been quarried from the same bed at Blackbird Hill, and the whole, not a part only of this formation, passes beneath all the other Cretaceous rocks of the north west.
In addition to this, we hare extensive collections of plants from the Tertiary of Nebraska, not a single species of which is identical with those from No.
1.
When we stated in some of our papers that it was possible we might have included in this formation beds not belonging to the Cretaceous, it was not because we thought any part of it might be Tertiary, but because we suspected some of the lower beds referred to it in Kansas might possibly be Jurassic ; and we are even now prepared to believe it may yet be found to repose on Jurassic rocks in that Territory, as it does at the Black Hills.
Descriptions op new Carboniferous Fossils.
The carboniferous species described in the following pages of this paper, were collected by us in Kansas, from the upper coal measures, extending up to the base of the Permian, through a series of strata holding a higher stratigraphical position than most of the coal deposits of the west.
We found this series of rocks abounding, at places, in organic remains, mostly of the same species occurring in the coal measures of Missouri, along with a few others approximating to Permian forms.
Amongst our collections from these rocks we have identified most of the carboniferous species figured by Prof. Marcou in his work on the geology of North America, which represents a group of fossils characteristic of our western coal measures.
We had hoped to have ready for this paper some remarks on ihe upper carboniferous and Permian rocks of Kansas, illustrated by many local sections, showing the range of the various fossils, but we have, for want of time, been compelled to defer these for another occasion.
Fdsulina cylindrica, Fischer.
In our collections from the upper members of the Coal Measures of Kansas, we have great numbers of FusuUna, many of which agree so very nearly with figures * It is of course unnecessary for us to inform geological readers that a rock overlaid by strata containing Ammonites and Inoceramus^ cannot be Tertiary, because these genera became extinct at the dawn of the Tertiary epoch.
[Dec. 261 and descriptions of the species above cited, that we have thus far failed to find any reliable diflFerences by which they can be distinguished.
If these are reallyidentical with F. cylindrica it not only proves that species to have had an immense geographical range, but to have existed through vast periods of time, since, according to Murchison de Verneuil andKeyserling, it is widely distributed in Russia, where it only occurs in the upper part of the lower carboniferous or mountain limestone series; while in Kansas it ranges through a great thickness of upper carboniferous rocks, much of which appears to be even more modern than most of the western coal measures.
F. cylindrica var.
ventricosa.
Along with the forms above mentioned, which we regard as probably identical with Fasulina cylindrica, we find in some of the upper members of the coal measures in Kansas, others differing so much in size and form, that we even suspect they may possibly belong to a distinct species.
These we propose to designate for the present as a variety of F. cylindrica^ under the name of ventricosa^ which will be a good specific name, should they prove to be distinct.
They differ from F. cylindrica^ as figured in Murchison de Verneuil and Keyserling's work on the geology of Russia, in being much larger, some of them measuring nearly half an inch in length, and 0.20 inch in diameter at the middle ; they are also proportionably much more ventricose, and differ in being usually less symmetrical, in consequence of ane side being more gibbous than the other.
The transverse grooves marking the position of the septa also pass across the central ventricose region with more of a lateral curve than in the Russian specimens ; while the edges of the septa themselves, when the outer shell is removed, are seen to be apparently less distinctly waved.
Again the aperture in all our specimens is so very narrow as to appear entirely closed.
In the description of the Russian specimens it is said that young individuals are proportionably so much shorter and more fusiform than the old, that they might readily be mistaken for a different species ; exactly the reverse, however, is the case with our Kansas specimens, the smaller individuals being more nearly cylindrical, while they appear to have become more gibbous with age, until in some cases they might be described as subglobose.

â This variety is found at Juniata on Blue river, and at Manhattan on the Kansas, far above all the coal beds yet discovered in Kansas.
Orthisina crassa, n. sp.
Shell thick, of medium size, Â§ubquadrate, rather compressed ; hinge, generally a little less than the greatest breadth of the shell, but sometimes equalling it.
Front broadly rounded ; lateral margins more or less arcuate, in some examples nearly straight.
Surface ornamented by numerous straight radiating striaj, numbering near the beaks about thirty to forty on each valve, but increasing by the implantation of others between them, from one hundred, to about one hundred and twenty four, around the margin ; these striae are crossed by numerous fine elevated concentric lines, which are not only quite distinct in the spaces between, but on well preserved specimens are prominent on the striÂ» to which they impart a sub-crenulate aspect, as seen by the aid of a lens.
Adult specimens also generally have several strong concentric imbricating marks of growth.
Larger or ventral valve nearly flat, cardinal edge sloping a little towards the lateral margins ; beak not very prominent or distinct, not incurved, sometimes a little twisted to one side ; area rather broad, flat, and inclined obliquely beyond the cardinal edge of the other valve ; deltedium thick and prominent.
Smaller or ventral valve moderately convex in the middle, concave on each side of the umbo, which is generally depressed : mesial tooth strong, and prominent, bifid.

19 262 ChONETES" MUCRONATA, n. Sp.
Shell rather large, semicircular, having its greatest breadth on the cardinal border, which is usually extended into mucronate angles.
Surface ornamented by a few sub-imbricating concentric marks of growth, crossed by fine regular closely set strise, about one hundred and fifty of which may be counted around the border, where eight or nine of them occupy the space of one line.
Larger valve depressed, having generally a broad, shallow, undefined, mesial sinus extending from the front towards the beak.
Ears sometimes separated from the central region by very shallow depressions, and often slightly curved upwards at the extremities.
Cardinal margin sloping a little from the beaks, on each side of which it is ornamented by from eight to eleven tubular spines, directed Â©bliquely outwards.
Area rather wide and, having a broad deltoid aperture, with elevated margins.
Smaller valve following nearly the curve of the other ; beak and central region concave ; ears flat ; area rather broad, but narrower than the other, and rectilinear.
Interior provided with a small very slightly projecting bifid median tooth, which nearly closes the aperture of the other valve.
From the base of this tooth there are five radiating ridges, two of which are rather obscure, and extend obliquely outwards near the cardinal edge, while a third extends at right angles to the hinge, a little more than half way across towards the front of the yalve.
The other two ridges are much shorter, and occupy an intermediate position between this median ridge and the lateral one, and are directed obliquely forwards and outwards.
The whole interior is more or less granulose, the granules near the border being much smaller than the others, and ranged in rows parallel to the strias on the outside.
Breadth of largest specimen 1.13 in.
; length 0-62 inch.
This species is very nearly allied to C. Smithn, of Norwood and Pratten, to which we we were at first inclined to refer it ; a careful examination, however, of a large number of individuals in all conditions of preservation, has satisfied us that the striae of the shell now before us are always entirely destitute of the pits so characteristic of C. Smithn.
Our shell is also much more extended on the hinge line, which terminates in more acute angles ; while there are not unfrequently eleven, instead of ten tubes on each side of the beak.

AxiNus (ScHizoDus) ovATUs, h. sp.
Shell ovate, most gibbous slightly in advance of the middle; anterior extremity broader than the other, somewhat narrowly rounded; posterior end narrow and compressed, obliquely truncate above, sub-angular below.
Base semiovate in outline, the most prominent part being in advance of the middle; cardinal edge very short, straight and horizontal, meeting the obliquely truncate posterior margin at an angle of about one hundred and thirty degrees.
Beaks located slightly in advance of the middle, elevated, and incurved at right angles to the hinge, rather distinctly angular down the posterior slopes and obliquely towards the lower part of the posterior extremity.
Surface unknown.
Length 0-65 inch ; heighth 0-45 inch ; transverse diameter of the two valves 0-20 inch.
This species appears to be about intermediate between Schizodus truncatus^ King, and S. rotundatus, Brown, as represented by figures 27 and 30, plate xv., King's Permian fossils of England.
From S. rotundatus, it differs in being more elongate, less broadly rounded in front, and much more obliquely truncate posteriorly ; the hinge line is also shorter and more nearly horizontal.
It differs from ;S'.
truncaius in the more nearly central position of the beaks, much shorter and less sloping cardinal edge ; while its anterior extremity is more narrowly rounded.

[Dec. 263 AlLORISMA ?
ALTIROSTRATA, D. Sp.
Shell oblong oval, very gibbous in the umbonal region ; beaks much elevated above the cardinal edge, incurved, and located over the anterior end.
Posterior extremity more compressed, but apparently more or less gaping, rounded in outline, anterior end vertically subtruncate, somewhat gaping ; base nearly straight, or a little concave near the middle, rounding up towards the extremities.
Cardinal border rather short, straight and inflected so as to form a moderately distinct, impressed area for the reception of the ligament.
Surface of cast marked by concentric undulations, which are narrower, more regular, and distinct on the umbones and over their slopes, than towards the base and extremities.
From the anterior side of the beaks, there is on each valve, an obscure sulcus descendiug obliquely and widening towards the middle of thebase.
Length 3-06 inch ; height from the base to dorsal margin 1-63 inch ; do.
to highest part of beaks 1"74 inch ; greatest transverse diameter.
Having ooly seen an internal cast of this shell, showing neither the muscular norpallial impressions, and giving no clue to the character of the hinge, there must remain some uncertainty respecting its generic relauons.
Its most marked peculiarity is the unusual elevation of the beaks, which gives it much the form of some of the Jurassic Pholadomyas.
We know of no other shell from the whole Carboniferous System with which it can be confounded.

Allorisma subcuneata, n. sp.
Shell large, clavate, cuneate, gibbous in the anterior and umbonal regions, contracted and compressed posteriorly.
Beaks depressed, incurved and removed about one eighth the length of the shell from its apterior extremity.
Posterior end narrowly rounded, and apparently gaping a little; buccal end olbliquely truncate above, rather narrowly rounded, and somewhat gaping below.
Base nearly straight along the middle, curving up very gradually behind, and abruptly in front ; dorsal outline sloping slightly from the beaks towards the anal extremity.
Surface of cast marked by more or less regular concentric undulations; hinge long and straight; lunule oval, not very well defined ; ligament area long and narrow, bounded on either side by a narrow obscure ridge, on the outside of which there is a long, parallel, shallow undefined sulcus.
Anterior muscular impression lunate, the upper extremity curved back over itself so as to give the whole somewhat the form of the letter G ; posterior muscular impression, large, oval, ovate, or rhomboidal, located about one third the length of the shell from the posterior end ; pallial impression faint, having a deep angular sinus.
Length 5-10 inch ; height 2-25 inch ; greatest thickness near the anterior end 1-70 inch.
This species is very similar to Sanguinolites clava of MeCoy, but its ventral margin is straighter, its beaks rather more depressed, and its anterior border more narrowly rounded below the beaks.
The lunette on the anterior side of the beaks, in our shell, appears to be less distinctly defined than is represented in Prof. McCoy's figure, while the anterior muscular impression m S. clava appears to be orbicular instead of lunate as in our shell.

This species bears such a striking similarity, in form and general aj^pearance, to some of the Jurassic and Cretaceous Panopseas, that we were at first lead to refer it to that genus, supposing as we then did, that it was a Permian species.
Since that time we have collected specimens of it in Kansas, showing that the hinge is edentulous, consequently it cannot be a Panopcea ; we therefore now refer it provisionally to the genera Allorisma, King, to which it appears most nearly related, though we are not quite sure it is a true Allorisma.
We found it ranging^ through a considerable thickness of the upper coal measures, but we do not think it ranges quite up into the Permian.

Liriodendron MeeJcii, Mihi.
L. foliis trilolbatis, lobo medio apice rotundato, late emarginato, basi angustato, lobis lateralibus obtusis.
Differt a L. Procaccinii, Unger, et a L. tuUpifera, L., lobis rotundatis et lobo medio basi angustato.
This leaf is furnished with a slender petiole, towards which it gradually diminishes ; the midrib extends to the apex ; towards the middle of the lobes on each side proceeds a secondary nerve, which also sends out on both sides tertiary nerves at rather acute angles.
Further down on each side (near the base) is another secondary nerve, which inosculates with the former.
This is a mode of structure which characterizes Liriodendron ; further up there arises very delicate secondary nerves, which likewise branch oS from the petiole.

The leaf gradually diminishes toward the base, rounded toward the apex, rather deeply emarginate, margins entire.
From the midrib which gradually becomes slender and dies out, proceed at acute angles very numerous secondary nerves which have the peculiarity of ramifying very much, 3.

Tlie form and nervation agree as far as the leaf has been preserved, with the preceding species, only the leaf is diminished in a somewhat less degree toward the petiole, and prolonged toward the apex as in Unger.
It looks quite similar to the leaves of Laurus primagenia, which I have received from Corfe, in the Isle of Wight.
Dunker (Paleontographica, iv.
Taf.
34, f. 2,) has figured a similar leaf as Salicites Hartigi, from the chalk of Blankenburg.
But in this, along with stouter secondary nerves, there are always several more delicate ones.
4.
Legiiminosites Marcouanus, Mihi.
L. foliis magnis, obovalibus, apice obtusis, emarginatis nervis secondariis sparsis ; basilaribus approximatis.
The leaflet is very large, but ceasalpinia-like, at the base somewhat unequal, obtusely rounded.
It is also rounded at the apex and deeply emarginate.
The midrib dies out toward the apex ; secondary nerves very sparse and delicate, one on each side near the base, the next following ones distant and much curved.
In its form it reminds one strongly of Ccesalpinia Falconeri, but is much larger.
It would, however, be important to know whether the leaf is leatherlike or thin skinned.
If the latter is the case, the leaf probably belongs to Csesalpinia, but if it is leather-like, the Dalbergia are to be compared, as among them similarly shaped leaves are found.

Populus leuce, Unger.

Phyllites leuce, Eossmassler, Blatter Von Altsaltel, Taf.
3, fig.
12 ?
Unfortunately this leaf is not preserved entire, and the margin is no where complete.
So far, however, as the form can be determined, it agrees with Populus leuce, as also in the nervation.
Thus we have a stout midrib, and from this mid rib above the base of the leaf proceeds on either side stout secondary nerves, which then send off outwardly two or three rather stout tertiary nerves, which are curved toward the apex.
Besides these, springs forth on each side below them, but almost at the same spot, a delicate secondary nerve which does not ramify any further, but dies out near the margin.
At about the middle of the height of the leaf, there springs from the midrib on each 1858.]
9 266 side, another secondary nerve, wliich runs nearly parallel with the basal one, and further above are two other similar ones.
The nervules are curved, soms remaining single, others forked.
In all these points the Nebraska leaf agreee with Populus leuce, but for a positive determination we must wait for leaves whose margins have been preserved.
A similar leaf from the Isle of Wight has been figured by Prestwieh (on the structure of the strata between the London clays, &c., Quart.
Jour.
x. pi.
iv.
fig.
1, 2), but in this (of which I have specimens before me) the lower basal nerves are much stouter, and the two upper ones are curved much more toward the apex, while the midrib cannot send forth any more sach stout secondary nerves farther up.
At first sight the leaf also appears similar to Credneria integerrima Zenker, Paleontographica, but in this leaf the midrib is much stouter, and the side nerves are more bent and curved towards the apex, otherwise the nervules are of similar structures.
6.
Populus cyclophylla, Mihi.
P. foliis orbiculatis, basi attenuatis, triplinervis, integerrimis.
Similar to the preceding, and may perhaps belong to that species as a younger leaf, yet the base of the leaf is attenuated toward the petiole, and there are at the base of the leaf only three nerves.
On the supposition that the former leaf is Populus leuce it is assumed that it is rounded at the base, but should more perfectly preserved specimens show that, like the small one, it is diminished at the base into the petiole, it would form a species different from Populus leuce, as in this latter species the leaves are rounded at the base, and moreover possess some obtuse teeth on the margin.
7.
PJujllites obtusi-lobatus, Mihi.
Folium trilobatum, lobis integerrimis, obtusiusculis.
Perhaps belonging to Liriodendron Meekii, but Liquidambar and Acer are also to be taken into consideration.
It is, however, too imperfectly preserved to be determined with certainty.
It seems to have three lobes with entire margins.
