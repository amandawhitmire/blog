The following were ordered to be printed: ON THE ORTHOPTERA OF BERMUDA.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN.
In the spring of 1909 the Academy received from Mr. Frank M. Jones a collection of Bermudan Orthoptera which had been secured by him during a residence of some months in the islands.
This sending was supplemented later by several others, the whole series, while not large, being of considerable interest, as Mr. Jones endeavored to secure every species seen during his stay, which lasted from December, 1908, to the latter part of April, 1909.
The examination of the literature on Bermudan Orthoptera demonstrated how imperfect and unsatisfactory was the last summary of the Bermudan representatives of the order, that of Verrill.
In consequence the published records were gathered together, the determinations of necessity being given as recorded unless the synonymy was well known and established, the results of the material on hand and the published records being incorporated into the paper here presented.
Twenty-eight species are here recorded, of which two taken from previous authors have only generic reference.
A tabulation of the species according to their distribution (omitting the two without specific identification) gives the following results: Peculiar to Bermuda 2 Tropical and subtropical America 2 South America, Antilles and Bermuda ] North America and Bermuda 5 Circumtropical 3 North America, West Indies and Bermuda 3 Cosmopolitan 5 All America 2 North America, Bahamas and Bermuda 1 North America, Mexico, Cuba, Bahamas and Bermuda 1 North America, Mexico and Bermuda 1 From this it would appear that the greater portion of the Qrthopterous fauna of the region is closer related to that of the mainland than to that of the Antilles, excluding, of course, from consideration the cosmopolitan and circumtropical forms, which probably have been introduced bv commerce.
The author wishes to express his indebtedness to Mr. Jones for his interest and energy which brought to light the most remarkable of the two known endemic species.
DERMAPTERA.
LABIDURID^.
Labidura bidens (Olivier).
Five adult males, one immature male and three adult females from Paget West, taken December 9 to March 24, have been examined and compared with Georgian and Cuban material of the species.
This species has been recorded (as L. riparia) by Uhler, Dahl, Scudder and Verrill.
The latter states (p. 827) that it is "not uncommon, occurring among debris along the shores, and also in storehouses," Uhler (p. 156) has suggested the probability of its introduction by commerce.
Anisolabis maritima (Bon.).
According to Verrill (p. 827) this species is common under decaying debris and stones at high-tide mark.
No Bermudan specimens have been seen by us, and no other author has recorded the species from the islands.
Anisolabis annulipes.
(HY Lucas).
This widely distributed species is represented by a male and four female individuals taken in Paget West, December 9 to March 30.
One female, taken March 30, 1909, has the femoral annuli practically absent.
Kirby 1 has described the Bermudan insect as distinct, but Caudell had shown it is not separable from the typical form of this almost cosmopolitan species.
ORTHOPTERA s. s. BLATTID^J.
Blattella germanica (Linnaeus).
Verrill (p. 826) recorded this species on local authority, but no specimens had been seen by him.
Ceratinoptera diaphana (Fabricius).
Scudder recorded this species from the collection made by J. M. Jones, while the present series contains three adult males, three adult females and five immature individuals taken in Paget West, January 2 to May 17.
The collector's notes are to the effect that the specimens 1 Anisolabis antennata, Journ.
Linn.
Soc.
London, XXIII, p. 517, 1891. were beaten from cedar trees and the species was found rarely under stones in woods.
The species is widely distributed in the West Indies.
Blatta orientalis Linnaeus.
Included on the authority of Verrill, who states (p. 825) that it is mostly confined to dwellings and ships.
Periplaneta americana (Linnseus).
This widely distributed species has been recorded by J. M. Jones, Uhler, Dahl, Hurdis and Verrill, and is represented in the series in hand by a single male from Paget West.
It is stated to be extremely abundant during the hot summer months, particularly in old houses surrounded by trees, and Verrill (p. 824) entertains the possibility of its being indigenous.
F. M. Jones' note.
"Not often seen, perhaps more abundant indoors," may be explained by the season when collecting was done not being the hot summer months, although the suggestion of greater abundance indoors is probably the more potent explanation.
Periplaneta australasiae (Fabricius).
Scudder and Verrill have both recorded this species, the latter author considering it common in the fields, under stones and in buildings.
An adult male from Paget West and one nymph from the same locality, taken May 8, are before us.
The collector's notes are to the effect that the species is very abundant under stones out of doors.
Leucophaea maderse (Fabricius).
This widely distributed species has been recorded from Bermuda by J. M. Jones, Uhler, Hurdis and Verrill.
The latter author states that it is very common in storehouses, while Jones and Hurdis agree in considering it less abundant than P. americana.
The former of these two last mentioned authors states (p. 110) that it is rarely seen except in cellars and other dark places, and that it is known locally as the "knocker," from a habit of making a noise like a person gently tapping on a box or board.
The present collection contains one female from Paget West, the notes accompanying which are the same as those on Periplaneta americana, and which can probably be explained in similar fashion.
Pyonoscelus surinamensis (Linnaeus).
This species has been recorded by Scudder, Dahl and Verrill, and is represented in the present series by two adult females and five immature specimens, taken in Paget West, December 11 to January 24.
It is found under stones and considered common.
MANTIDJE.
Stagmomantis sp.
Verrill (p. S23) records on Henshaw's authority a species of this genus in Bickmore's collection from Bermuda.
Mr. F. M. Jones (in litt.)
comments as follows on this record: "The mantis recorded was perhaps a stray specimen, otherwise I should have seen at least the egg-masses before this."
PHASMID^].
Anisomorpha buprestoides.
On Henshaw's authority Verrill (p. 823) also records this species as taken in Bermuda many years ago (about 1861) by A.
8.
Bickmore.
The fact that* both this and the preceding species have been unnoticed by other collectors, in spite of their conspicuousness wherever found, leads one to suspect the possibility of erroneous labelling.
ACRIDID^J.
Orphulella pelidna (Burmei*r e r).
Uhler (p. 152) has recorded this species as Stenobothrus maculipennis, one of its synonyms.
Probably 0. olivacea is the species to which the reference should belong.
Orphulella olivacea (Morse).
Scudder (p. 43) has recorded this species, and a series of two males and five females taken in Warwick Parish, December 11 to April 18, are now before us.
Probably Dahl's record of a species of Orplnda and J. M. Jones' "small yellowish-brown colored grasshopper" belongto this species.
The latter author says (p. Ill) the species is " common on open tracts, particularly where the sandy waste is relieved by tufts of grass."
The notes with the specimens in hand are to the effect that it is not rare and found on the south shore of Warwick Parish.
Orphulella speciosa Scudder.
This species was recorded by J. M. Jones in 1876 on Scudder's determination, the record being published as Stenobothrus bilineatus, one of the synonymic names of the species.
It appears probable to the author that the record really refers to 0. olivacea, a species unrecognized at that date.
Dissosteira Carolina (Linna-us).
This species has been recorded by Jones and Verrill, and three females from Paget West, December 16-27, 1908, and summer of 1909 are in the present series.
The two December specimens were the only ones seen by the collector during his stay, the summer individual having been sent him by a friend.
These specimens have the median carina of the pronotum lower and more uniform in elevation than in the majority of specimens from the United States.
Scnistoceroa americana (Drury).
Caudell (p. 330) has recorded this species from Bermuda.
Paroxya bermudensis Rehn.
1909.
Paroxya bermudensis Rehn, Ent.
News, XX, p. 343.
[Warwick Parish, Bermuda.]
The full data for this most interesting species are given in the original description.
It is apparently a form which matures late in the fall and in early winter, as search in March, April and May in the section where the types were taken on January 15 revealed only immature individuals.
TETTIGONID^3.
Neoconocephalus triops (Linnaeus).
Verrill (p. 821) has recorded this species as Conocephalus dissimilis on Henshaw's authority.
Neoconocephalus maxillosus (Fabricius).
This Antillean species is represented in the present series by a single male and two females taken in Paget West, December-January and summer of 1909, and at Walsingham, February 16.
These specimens are smaller than Redtenbacher's measurements of the species, but otherwise no differences exist.
The male Paget West individual measures as follows : Length of body 24.0 mm.
Length of fastigium 1.2 Length of pronotum 7.5 Length of tegmen 30.5 " Length of caudal femur 18.0 This is the first record of the species from Bermuda.
Neoconocephalus fusco-striatus "(Redtenbacher).
Scudder (p. 43) has recorded this species, and a pair taken in Paget West, December to January, are before us.
According to the accompanying notes the species is not common at that season.
Orchelimum vulgare Harris.
Uhler (p. 158) has recorded this species on the basis of a badly broken female individual.
Conocephalus fasciatus (DeGeer).
(Xiphidium fasciatum Auct.)
One male and three females of this species taken in Paget West are in the present series.
This is the first record of the species from Bermuda, where it is said to be locally abundant.
GRYLLID^J.
Gryllus bermudensis Caudell.
This form, recently described on the basis of a single specimen, is represented in the present collection by an interesting series of fortyone individuals taken in Warwick Parish, in Paget West and on St. George Island, on a number of dates in December, January, April and May.
The majority of the specimens are accompanied by habitat data, and the whole series presents some light on the extent of variability in size, proportions and coloration in material of this genus from a circumscribed locality.
The striking coloration of the tj^pe is hardly equalled in the series before us, although closely approached, but in no case is the extent of ochraceous on the head as great as originally described.
Mr. Caudell, while in Philadelphia, kindly looked over some of the material treated in this connection and, as far as memory served him, he considered the specimens to belong to his species.
It is apparent that the majority of specimens are darker and less contrastingly colored than the type, and it is as evident that a considerable amount of color variation is present in the species.
From a type with the head and pronotum blackish, marked on the gense, shoulders of pronotum, borders of the lateral lobes, cephalic edge of pronotal disk and around the eyes with ochraceous, and having the tegmina and limbs rufotestaceous, the series can be laid in a graduated transition to a nearly uniform blackish type.
The specimens from the south shore of Warwick Parish exhibit a constant type of coloration for the habitat, four males and two females from this section, all taken in April and May, having the head and pronotum shining black, with little or no ochraceous and comparatively pale tegmina and limbs.
A depauperate pair from the meadows of Paget West, all seen from the locality, are blackish brown without any pale color, except on the angle of the tegmina where there is a touch of testaceous.
The other series are either of a uniform type, blackish brown with a limited and variable amount of ochraceous on the genae and pronotum, or each locality has several different shades of coloration.
In size we have an interesting case of depauperation in five specimens from Paget West and Warwick Parish Meadows and Warwick Parish without further data, all the other material being of what might be considered more normal size.
Careful tabulation of the proportions of the ovipositor and caudal femora reveals a variable disparity between the two, and while the correlation with the habitat is barren of results of a positive character, the suggestions are rather significant.
The proportions of the females are as follows : Caudal femora.
Ovipositor.

At the present time it does not appear desirable to attempt to make any statement on the systematic relationship of this species.
To regard it as an entity worthy of a name, whether specific or subspecific, appears to us to be a necessary course, but what its possible origin was or nearest affinities are can only be determined by careful quantitative work on not only this, but also the closely related North American and West Indian species of the genus.
Mr. Jones' notes are to the effect thai the species is very abundant under stones.
Gryllus luctuosus Serville.
This species has been recorded by Uhler and Verrill, and also as the synonymous dbbrevicUus by the latter author.
It is quite probable that these references really belong to the preceding species, G. bermudensis.
Gryllus assimilis Fabricius.
Dahl has credited this species, but no doubt the reference really belongs to G. bermiulensis.
Liphoplus krugii Saussure.
Four females of this species, taken January G and 18 in Paget West, are in the collection.
When compared with Cuban specimens they are found to be inseparable.
The collector's notes are to the effect that the species is not frequent and that the specimens were beaten from cedar trees.
This is the first record of the species from the Bermudas.
Cylindrogryllus sp.
Dahl has recorded an undetermined species of this South American genus as living in numbers on a gray-leafed shrub growing in moist places.
A strong suspicion exists in the author's mind that the wellknown Liphoplus krugii may have been erroneously determined as a Cylindrogryllus by Dahl.

SOME NOTES ON IDAHO ORTHOPTERA., WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF TRIMEROTROPIS.
BY JAMES A. G. REHX.
The following notes and records are based on a small but interesting collection of Orthoptera made in the month of July at Springfield, Bingham County, Idaho, by Dr. Henry Skinner.
One of the most interesting species in the collection is Trimcrotropis rebellis Saussure.
a form which stood on our lists as a species unrecognized in American collections for several decade^.
MANTIDiE.
Litaneutria minor (Scudder).
One female.
This is the first exact record of the species from Idaho, Scudder's only record from that State being "Southern Idaho," taken from Bruner's record of " Ameles sp."
AORIDIDiE.
Cordillaoris affinis Morse.
Four females.
July '_'.").
These specimens agree with the characters given by Morse for separating tnis species from C. occipitalis, and in addition the species is seen to differ in the narrower interspace between the eyes.
This species was described from Ormsby County.
Nevada, and is here recorded from outside that State for the first time.
Stirapleura delioatula (Scudder).
One female.
July 25.
This is the first Idaho record of the species.
Hippiscus neglectus (Thomas).
One female.
July 25.
This specimen lacks the pale line along the posterior anal vein seen in some individuals.
Hippiscus validus Scudder.
Two females.
July 24.
These specimens have the tegmina several millimeters longer than the measurement given by Scudder for the species, which was described from Blaine County, Idaho, and also exhibit other minor differences; but inasmuch as the specimens show considerable individual variation in themselves, it appears preferable to regard the material in hand as validus, at least until further information is available.
Conozoa wallula Scudder.
One female.
July 25.
Trimerotropis rebellis Saussure.
Two males, one female.
One dated July 25.
These specimens fully agree with the original description of the species which was described from California.
Rehn and Hebard's T. bilobata is the closest relative of this species, differing, however, in the characters given in the diagnosis of their species.
Trimerotropis gracilis (Thomas).
One female.
This species has been recorded from Birch Creek, Idaho.

The general color is much like that of Trimerotropis maritima interior, but the pronotal crest is very much more decided than in that race.
Size slightly less than the average for the genus ; form moderately slender; surface of the body more or less distinctly punctate except for the glabrous venter of the thorax and abdomen.

Tegmina exceeding the apex of the abdomen by about ( 9 ) or nearly (cT) the length of the head and pronotum together, rather slender, the greatest width contained about five and one-half times in the length, the apex oblique rotundatotruncate.
Wings rather narrow, the greatest width very slightly more than half the length.
Caudal femora of medium build, the ventral carina hardly arcuate and not produced; caudal tibiae with eight to nine spines on the external margin.
General color very pale pinkish ochraceous, becoming yellowish on the abdomen and venter, the overlying markings being dull, burnt umber.

2 A NEW SPECIES OF ENCHYTRJEID WORM FROM THE WHITE MOUNTAINS.
BY R. SOUTHERN, B.SC.
In the late summer of 1907, after the meeting of the International Zoological Congress at Boston, Dr. Scharff visited the White Mountains in New Hampshire.
He informs me that earthworms were very rarely met with in the forests at elevations of 2,000-3,000 feet, but he succeeded in finding a few specimens of Helodrilus (Dendrobcena) rubidus Savigny, forma typica, under the bark of trees.
The typical form of this species has not yet been recorded with certainty from North America.
Michaelsen, in 1900/ doubtfully includes North America, but later 2 he confines its distribution to Europe and Asia.
The variety subrubicunda (Eisen) is widely distributed over the whole Northern Hemisphere.
The typical form is endemic in the British Isles, Germany, France, Switzerland, Siberia and Iceland.
Its occurrence on the latter island and on the eastern side of North America is interesting with reference to theories of a former land connection between Europe and North America by way of Iceland and Greenland.
3 After a close examination of the American specimens, I was unable to find a single character distinguishing them from the same species, which occurs commonly in Ireland.
In some damp moss, in which Dr. Scharff brought back some living slugs and newts from the White Mountains at an elevation of 2,000 feet, I found a single mature specimen of an Enchytrseid worm which appears to be new to science, and for which I propose the name Henlea scharffi sp.
n. It is 10 mm.
long, and milky-white in color.
The epidermis of the prostomium and first segment is covered with small glandular papillae.
The clitellum is formed by a mosaic of large granular glands, and occupies the 12th segment.
In the anterior ventral bundles there are 5 seta?, which are approximately equal in length, slightly curved, 1 Das Tierreich, Oligochceta, Lief.

19 and widely separated at the base.
The head-pore is situated between the prostomium and first segment.
The brain (fig.
1) is concave before and behind.
The length exceeds the breadth, and the greatest breadth is near the posterior end.
No salivary glands were observed.
The ccelomic corpuscles are large, flat, broadly oval to circular disks.
.The intestine widens out somewhat gradually at the beginning of the 9th segment.
There are no intestinal pouches.
The dorsal vessel rises in the 9th segment, and the blood is colorless.
Three pairs of septal glands are present in the 4th, 5th and 6th segments.
The nephridia (fig.
2) have a large anteseptal, somewhat longer than broad.
The postseptal is 2 to 3 times as long, and the duct, Fig.

which equals the postseptal in length, rises from the anterior end.
The spermathecae, which lie in the 5th segment, are long and slender, showing no differentiation into duct and ampulla (figs.
3 and 4).
The opening to the exterior is surrounded by a large rosette of glands.
Fig.
4 shows this from the inside.
This description is very inadquate, owing to the lack of material, but sufficient was seen to differentiate this form from all other species of the genus.
H. scharffi is characterized by the structure of the nephridia and spermathecae, the number of setae, the place of origin of the dorsal vessel, and the absence of salivary glands and intestinal pouches.
This species falls into that somewhat unsatisfactory section of the genus which is characterized by the absence of intestinal pouches.
This group includes: 1.
Henlea dicksoni (Eisen).

H. rosai Bretscher.

Spermathecae uniform in width; dorsal vessel rising in the 9th segment H. scharffi.
Spermathecae differentiated into duct and ampulla; dorsal vessel rising in the 8th segment H. stolli.
Members of this genus are characterized by the sudden change in diameter of the gut, where the oesophagus passes into the middle intestine, and by the frequent presence at this point of intestinal outgrowths or pouches.
In H. scharffi these pouches are absent and the change in diameter is gradual, and is spread over half a segment.
In this feature it bears some resemblance to the species H. lefroyi, described by Beddard 4 from India.
In the latter species Beddard — working on preserved material — found that the oesophagus passed without any abrupt change in dimensions into the middle gut.
The two species also resemble each other in being without the intestinal pouches.
The genus Henlea includes a somewhat heterogenous assembly of species, and will probably be found to contain several distinct generic types.
However, the present species may be placed provisionally in this genus.
The type-specimen is preserved in the Irish National Museum, Dublin.

VARIATION OF POLYGYRA ALBOLABRIS IN MICHIGAN.
BY BRYANT WALKER.
Polygyra albolabris Say is not only the largest, but one of the most abundant and widely distributed species of the genus.
It inhabits the whole of the Eastern States and Canada, ranging north to the Saskatchewan, south to Florida and west to Nebraska, Kansas and Texas.
It may be fairly said to be the characteristic land snail of the region.
In view of the enormous extent of territory which it occupies, and the very diverse environmental conditions to which it is subjected, it would naturally be expected to show a very considerable range of variation.
This Is true particularly in the Southern States, where in the southeast two well-marked varieties {major Binn.
and fuscolabris Pils.)
have been developed, and in the southwest a third (allcni Weth.
), which practically replaces the typical form west of the Mississippi from Missouri to Texas.
In the region north of the valley of the Tennessee River and east of the Mississippi, however, the typical form is everywhere present and, except in size and contour, presents no substantial variation.
Barring var.
dentata Tryon, a dentate form, and var.
fusca Billings, a color variation, which do not come within the province of this paper, the only varieties to receive recognition have been based mainly on size.
There have been three of these to appear in the literature, of which only one has been fully described, viz.
: var.
mariiima Pils.
1 from the New Jersey coast.
Var.
minor Sterki 2 from New Philadelphia, O., is simply stated to be "a peculiar, small, thin-shelled form."
While var.
traversensis Leach 3 was never described at all, but was a MSS.
name attached to a small form collected by Leach near Traverse City, Michigan, which is stated by Pilsbry 4 to be "scarcely distinguishable" from var.
mariiima.

Land Shells of Am.
(1898).
22 [Jan., of Michigan, the fact of these references to a small form of Polygyra albolabris raised a question as to whether there was really a small race in Michigan worthy of varietal distinction or not, and led to the investigation, the results of which are embodied in this paper.
The material used consisted of 511 specimens, contained in six distinct sets as follows: Fig.
1.
I.
Two hundred and twenty-five specimens, representing the writer's collection of Michigan albolabris.
These shells are from all parts of the State.
It contains 53 separate lots, varying from 1 to 11 in number, from 38 of the S3 counties of the State.
The accompairying chart shows the various counties represented in the collection, and the larger figures the total number of specimens from each county.
While an inspection of this chart shows a lamentably large number of counties wholly unrepresented, it is to be borne in mind that the physical conditions of Michigan are much more uniform than in many other States where there is a greater diversity of surface, and that, therefore, as far as they go the specimens from the region south of the SaginawGrand Valley may be fairly considered as representative of all the counties in that district; the shells from the Grand Traverse region as of those characteristic of the sandy plains of the northern part of the Lower Peninsula, and those from the Upper Peninsula as representative of that region.
The small number of specimens from so large an area is, of course, unfortunate, but that could not be helped.
In considering the results of a study of this series, it is necessary to bear in mind the manner in which it has been accumulated.
It is not an entirely "unprejudiced" series of specimens, i.e., it does not include in every instance all the specimens that were collected at the locality represented.
The collection in this particular may be divided into three classes: 1.
A very considerable number of sets, mostly small in number of individuals, which are all the specimens that were collected at the particular place represented.
2.
Sets received from correspondents, which were, no doubt, selected from a more or less extensive series of duplicates.
3.
Sets collected by myself and selected from a larger number of specimens.
In such cases it has always been my intention to preserve a representative series, consisting of the extreme forms and a fair representation of what appeared at the time to be average specimens.
But, of course, the proportion of extreme specimens would be largely in excess of what it would be had the whole series been retained.
In view, therefore, of the very large proportion of selected specimens included in the series, it would seem likely that the series as a whole would give results, especially as to size, that would be in excess of that obtained from an entirely unprejudiced series.
II.
One hundred and twenty-four specimens from Isle Royale, Lake Superior, Mich., collected by the University of Michigan Expedition in 1906.
This series includes all the specimens collected on the island.
The number of specimens was so much larger than the series from any other Michigan locality that it was deemed best not to incorporate it with the general Michigan series, on account of the preponderating influence it would have in determining the extent of variation in the shell as a whole.
As shown by figs.
5 and 7, however the results, so far as the variation in height and width are concerned would not have been substantially changed.
But the size of the average shell would be considerably reduced.
III.
One hundred and fifty-two specimens from Cincinnati, O., collected by the late A. G. Wetherby.
This was Prof. Wetherby's duplicate series, and may be fairly considered to be a representative series from that locality.
It was used as being the only large series from a single locality available as a basis of comparison with the Michigan specimens.
IV.
Seven specimens of P. albolabris maritima Pils.
from Cape May, N.J., viz.
: 3 from the collection of Mr. G. H. Clapp; 3 from that of the writer and the type as given by Pilsbry in the original description.
V. Three specimens of P. albolabris minor Sterki from New Philadelphia, 0., received from Dr. Sterki.
VI.
Nine specimens of the original lot of P. albolabris traversensis, collected by Leach near Traverse City, Mich.
This set is also included in the general Michigan series (I).
For the purpose of comparing these different series and platting the results, three different measurements have been used: 1.
The height, which is the distance from the apex to the lower base of the lip, measured on a line parallel with the axis.
2.
The greater diameter, measured on a line at right angles to the axis and including the lip.
3.
The ratio of the height to the diameter, obtained by dividing the altitude by the width, the resulting percentage being the axial index of the shell.
5 This method in the case of albolabris gives a reasonable basis of comparison as to the proportionate height of the shell, although it is obvious that it is neither accurate nor satisfactory as a basis for a comparison of shape, as two shells may have the same axial index and yet one be trochiform and the other planorboid.
Owing to the comparativeh' low spire and large body whorl of albolabris, no satisfactory method of determining the comparative elevation of the spire and angular divergence of its sides has been suggested, and attempts in that direction were abandoned as futile.

Nat., XXXVIII, p. 661 (1904).

25 The Cincinnati Series.
Say did not give the locality of his type of albolabris nor its height.
Its width is given as one inch.
W. G. Binney (Manual Am.
Land Shells, p. 299) gives 30 x 17 mm.
as the size of typical albolabris, but gives no information as to the basis on which the measurement was determined.
In the absence of any better basis for comparison, the Cincinnati series was adopted as probably representative of the species in the Ohio Valley and a locality about midway between the northern and southern range of the typical form.

The Cincinnati shells exhibit considerable variation in height, but within comparatively narrow limits, ranging from 16 to 22 mm., the average being 18.78.
The major mode is at 18.75, with minor modes at 17, 18, 20 and 21.
It is to be noted that practically one-half (75) of the specimens are from 18 to 19 mm.

Ninety-four specimens or nearly 62 per cent, are from 27 to 29 mm.

It is also to be noted that only a single example is less than 26 mm.

In comparison with the variability in height and width, the curve of the axial index is remarkably simple, showing great uniformity in the series in the general proportions of the shell.

Eighty-nine specimens or 58 per cent, have an index between 66 and 68 per cent.
The Minor Varieties.
The number of authentic specimens of the three smaller varieties available for study is too small to justify platting a curve for them separately.

At the same time that Dr. Leach collected these recent shells, he also collected a series of fossil shells from the marl lying beneath the present forest, where the typical set was found.
The series is of interest as showing that, as a local form, this variety has existed in the same place for a very long period of time and substantially unchanged in character.
The dimensions of this series (14) are as follows: Alt 15.00 17.75 Diam 23.00 25.75 Index 65 .67 Alt 16.00 14.50 Diam 25.00 22.00 Index 64 .66 Alt 14.75 Diam 22.50 Index 66 The average shell is 22.14 x 14.71 mm.
with an index of .66.
Comparing this series with the recent shells, it is to be noted that while the range of variation both in height and width is greater in the fossil series, the average shell in each series is very nearly the same.

The recent traversensis, however, are not only considerably smaller but also proportionately more depressed.
While the recent shells are too few in number and too variable to establish a satisfactory curve, the following arrangement of the several frequencies in the 19 specimens is nevertheless of interest, both as showing the range of variation and for comparison with other series.

Comparing these results with those derived from the Cincinnati series, it is to be noted: 1910.]
29 1.
That while both series vary greatly in diameter they do not overlap, there being a break of 1.75 mm.
between the largest of the "minor" series and the smallest of the Cincinnati shells.
The average diameter of the minor series is 22.97, as against 28.35 mm.
in the Cincinnati series, and that while 62 per cent, of the Cincinnati series are from 27 to 29 mm.
in diameter, more than 68 per cent, of the minor series are from 20 to 23 mm.
in width.
2.
That notwithstanding this great difference in size, the proportions of the shells of both series are substantially the same, the index of the minor series ranging from .59 to .73 and that of the Cincinnati series from .60 to .74, the average index in both series, however, being the same, .66.
3.
That while perhaps it may be claimed that the minor series is too small, in proportion to the Cincinnati series, to give any satisfactory comparison, nevertheless the evidence, such as it is, certainly tends to show the existence of a smaller race of substantially the same general shape, but averaging 5.36 mm., or 19 per cent., smaller in diameter.
The General Michigan Series.
As shown by the figure, this series exhibits great variability in i^iii{*t«iat«i^i^i^t«i4i*t*^*i'"" f—4 Fig.
5 — Widths — Upper line, 225 Michigan and 124 Isle Royale.

size, ranging from 18.75 to 34.25 mm.
in width, with an average of 26.95.
The major mode is at 29, with minor modes at 30.5, 28, 26.75 and 25.
The average is 26.95 mm.
There is a decided break at 24.5, below which there is a series of minor modes at 24.23, 22 and 19.75.
Were it not for the strong minor mode at 24.75 and 25, the break at 24.5 would be much more conspicuous.
As the fifteen specimens aggregated at these points are from twelve different localities, scattered all over the State and in both peninsulas, it is evident that this is a feature of the Michigan race as a whole, and not the result of a few sets of strongly characterized local forms.
The same peculiarityappears in the Isle Royale series (fig.
12), and is intensified when the two series are combined (fig.
5).
It is similar to the strong minor mode culminating at 30.25.
Indeed, the diversion of the whole series between 24.50 and 34.25 mm.
into five well-marked groups is quite striking.
In the same way the minor series below 24.5 is divided into five similar groups.
It is to be noticed that the break in this series at 24.5 is substantially at the same place where the break occurs between the Cincinnati and the "minor" series.
This is apparently more than a mere coincidence.
It is certainly corroborative evidence tending to strengthen the inference drawn from the comparison of those series.
Of the 225 specimens in the Michigan series, 55 are 24.5 mm.
in diameter or less and 170 are more than 24.5.
Of the smaller group 8 are from the Upper Peninsula and 47 from the Lower.
Of the larger series 34 are from the Upper and 136 from the Lower Peninsula.
That is, in the Upper Peninsula 19 per cent, belong to the smaller race and 26 per cent, in the Lower Peninsula.
In fig.
1 the number of specimens of 24.5 mm.
or less in diameter from each county are represented by the smaller figure.
Thus in Kent County, of the 30 specimens in the series, 9 are of the smaller race.
In considering the probability of the existence of a small race, it is necessary to distinguish between dwarf individuals, which occur occasionally in all series of any extent, and a race of small individuals, which are all more or less characterized by their diminutive size, It is only the latter, of course, that is entitled to recognition in any proper varietal sense.
From an inspection of fig.
1, it will appear that, while the small individuals are fairly well scattered over the State and in some cases are no doubt individual dwarfs, they are nevertheless more numerous in the northern part of the State, where the environmental conditions are generally more unfavorable to molluscan life and likely to affect the species as a whole.
And it is significant also that of the entire series of 55, no less than 37 occur in the four counties of Charlevoix, Grand Traverse, Huron and Kent.
The series from Kent is peculiar in being from so far south and in a county where the typical form is also well represented.
The series, however, is well marked and proba1910.]

Unfortunately all data on this point are lacking.
On the whole, therefore, there seems to be reasonable ground for dividing the Michigan series into two groups at this point (24.5 mm.
), and for the purposes of this paper they will be treated on that basis, although there is no doubt but that a certain proportion of the series of smaller shells are individual and not racial diminutives.
For purposes of convenience and ignoring all questions of synonomy between the varietal names of maritima, minor and traversensis, the smaller race will be termed the "minor" form and the larger race will be referred to as the "major" form.

Axial index — 225 Michigan.
The range of variation in the axial index of the Michigan series, taken as a whole, is very considerable, ranging from .59 to .75, with an average of .67.
The curve is multimodal, but within rather narrow limits, the major mode being at .65, a conspicuous minor mode at .67, and two others of the same height at .63 and .71.
Compared with the Cincinnati series, it shows much greater variability but with nearly the same average proportion.
One hundred and seven specimens, or 48 per cent., are between .64 and .68, while only 63, or 28 per cent., are between .66 and .68, as against 59 per cent, in the Cincinnati series.

The Isle Royale Series.
This series is of interest as being, like that from Cincinnati, representative of a comparatively restricted region with no great variation 3 34 [Jan., in the environmental conditions.
Compared with the general Michigan series, coming from a very much greater extent of territory and representing the effect of very diverse conditions of environment, it would naturally be expected, like the Cincinnati series, to show much le.-s variation.
This is true so far as the height of the shell is concerned.
But in width the range of variation is much greater and is more similar to that of the general Michigan series.
This is owing to the fact that both the Isle Royale and Michigan series extend below 24.5 and include the minor race, which does not appear in the Cincinnati series.

Michigan varies from 24.75 to 34.25 or within 9.50 mm.

The shells of the Upper and Lower Peninsulas.
36 [Jan., Of the general Michigan series, 42 are from the Upper Peninsula and 183 are from the Lower.
As shown by figs.
5 and 12, the curve of widths in both series is very similar.
This being so, if the Upper Peninsular examples from the general series are added to the Isle Royale series, we shall have a fair basis for comparison of the species as between these two portions of the State.
There are then 166 Upper Peninsular specimens and 183 from the Lower Peninsula.

The curves of the axial index of the two series are almost exactly the same, the modes being in every instance at the same point, -but with some slight variation in the number of frequencies and with a slightly larger range of variation in the Lower Peninsular series.
The average index in the Upper Peninsular series is .654, as against .677 in the Lower Peninsula.
The average shells of the two series compare as follows : Alt.

That is, the average Upper Peninsular shell is smaller by 1.08 mm.

1. maritime!
15.60 22.70 .68 2. minor Sterki 14.25 21.25 .67 3. traversensis 13.31 21.31 .63 4.

Lower Peninsular series 14.04 22.18 .66 6.
General Michigan series 14.67 22.30 .66 7.
Total Michigan series (4 and 5) 14.74 22.75 .66 From this table it will be seen — 1.
That all the Michigan shells of the minor form are more depressed than the typical maritima and minor Sterki.
This is specially true of the typical traversensis.
2.
That, with the exception of the typical traversensis series, all the Michigan series have the same index.
It is to be noted, however, that the traversensis series is included in series 5, 6 and 7, and that, if that series was eliminated, the index of these series would be somewhat increased and more closely approximated to that of maritima and minor Sterki.
3.
That the Upper Peninsular series average larger than that of the Lower Peninsula by 1.4 mm.
in height and 1.13 mm.
in width.
This is in marked contrast with the major forms of the two series, in which the Lower Peninsular shell is larger by 1.08 mm.
in height and 1.29 mm.
in width.
This is well shown by comparing the two curves in fig.
15.
4.
On the whole, however, the several series show a remarkable uniformity.
It would seem to be reasonably clear that the minor form of albolabris varies in about the same way within certain fairty defined limits.
There is reason to believe that in certain locations these peculiarities affect the whole race, and in such cases is worthy of varietal recognition.
It is equally true, no doubt, that many of the minor shells are merely depauperate individuals.
But whichever is the case, so far as size and proportion are concerned, the amount and range of variation is substantially the same.
The explanation of this probably is that the amount of depauperization that the species will sustain and still exist is substantially the same everywhere, and that consequently the result of unfavorable conditions, whether applied to the individual or to a local colony, will be within certain limits very similar.
It is to be noticed that the axial index of the major and minor forms is substantially the same.
That is to say, that while there is a well marked division into two races, the variation is mainly one of size and not of proportion.
3.
The Major Races.
The average of the several "major" series may be compared as follows : Alt.
Diam.
Index.
1.
Cincinnati series 18.78 28.35 .66 2.
Upper Peninsular series 17.59 26.79 .65 3.
Lower Peninsular series 19.44 29.26 .677 4.
General Michigan series 19.06 29.31 .67 5.
Total Michigan series (2 and 3) 18.52 28.03 .665 Taking the average Cincinnati shell as a basis for comparison, we find that the Upper Peninsular shell is smaller both in height and width and also more depressed; while the Lower Peninsular shell is both higher and wider and proportionately more elevated.
This is also true of both series 4 and 5, the latter, however, being very close to the Cincinnati type in every particular.
As it is a matter of common knowledge that the southern albolabris are usually larger than those from the Northern States, the larger size of the average Lower Peninsular shell seems peculiar.
But this is probably owing to the fact that the series is not an "unprejudiced" one, but, as already explained, contains a larger proportion of selected specimens than would occur in a natural series.
The inclusion of a certain proportion of Upper Peninsular shells in the general Michigan series serves to reduce the average size, and in series 5 a still greater addition of the smaller northern form brings the average down nearly to that of Cincinnati.
It seems probable, therefore, that a large and unprejudiced series of southern Michigan shells would show an average not to exceed and quite likely somewhat smaller than the Cincinnati type.
While it is true that the results obtained from the Lower Peninsular series are perhaps subject to criticism as to size, there does not seem any ground to question the results obtained by a comparison of the axial indices, which show that the Upper Peninsular shell is somewhat more depressed, while the Lower Peninsular type is considerably more elevated than the Cincinnati shell.
In this connection it is to be noted that the axial index shows simply the proportion between the height and the width.
It does not necessarily show that one race is more conical than the other.
It is to be regretted that no satisfactory method for definitely determining this fact was found.
In the absence of specific proof, it is only possible to record the writer's impression, derived from a careful study of the material, that as a rule the Lower Michigan shells are not only proportionately more elevated, but are actually more conical in shape.
Conclusions.
From a careful study of the foregoing data, the following conclusions seem to be justified: 1.
That Polygyra albolabris in Michigan exhibits great variability in size.
2.
That both the Upper and Lower Peninsular series show a wellmarked division into two parts, the dividing line being at 24.5 mm.
in width.
3.
That this dividing line corresponds quite exactly with that separating the several described minor varieties and the typical form as exemplified by the Cincinnati series.
4.
That the evidence tends to show that when depauperization takes place in P. albolabris, whether in individuals or in local races, the results are within certain fairly definite lines.
5.
That when depauperization affects substantially the whole race in a particular locality or district, it is sufficiently permanent to be worthy of varietal recognition.
6.
That the depauperate shells of the Lower Peninsula are on an average smaller and more depressed than those of the Upper Peninsula.
7.
That the major (or typical) series of the Upper Peninsula is smaller and more depressed than that from the Lower Peninsula.
8.
That the major series of the Lower Peninsula is larger and more elevated than the Cincinnati series.
9.
That this is probably to be accounted for by the fact that the Michigan series is not an unprejudiced one and contains a large proportion of selected specimens.
10.
That the average shell of both Michigan series combined is substantially the same as that of the Cincinnati series.
11.
That the great variability of the Michigan series, taken as a whole, as compared with the Cincinnati series, is due mainly to the greater diversity of environmental conditions.

BY HAROLD SELLERS COLTON.
That small organisms act to the surface film of the water verymuch as they would react to a solid substratum is a matter of common observation.
Thus we see Hydra and various colonial protozoa hanging from the surface film, and such mollusks as Lymnoea and Physa crawling on its under side.
Although the writer has never seen it reported, yet it is not strange that lamellibranch mollusks should react likewise.
To be sure few lamellibranchs use their foot in a manner comparable to the broad crawling organ of the gasteropod, yet young ones oftentimes use their ciliated foot in a similar fashion.
However, one morning last winter at Naples, the writer observed an adult Modiolaria crawling on the surface film by means of its bvssus.
Being at once struck by seeing so large an animal suspended by such slender threads attaching it to so uncertain a substratum, he at once made a sketch of it (see figure ).
The specimen in question was found hanging by three threads and was already secreting a fourth.
In other words it was progressing exactly as Mytilus would have done on a solid substratum.
Where the threads were fast to the surface the film was depressed.
Although Lymncea and Physa expose a large area of foot to the film, this animal, not so big it is true, hangs from three or four points.
View of Modiolaria marmorata, looking down upon it as it was suspended from the surface film.
The threads represent the byssus, and the "V" at the end, the depression of the surface film.
The specimen has been very kindly identified by Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry as Modiolaria marmorata Forbes.
This is a small Modiolaria (8 mm.
x 5 mm.)
which for protection buries itself deep in the test of such large Ascidians as Pkalusia mammilata or Ascida mentula.
It is an abundant form at Naples, and well worth a more extended study.

The Chiricahua Mountains stand near the southeastern angle of Arizona, extending for about fifty miles from northwest to southeast, being one of the numerous short roughly parallel ranges of that part of New Mexico and Arizona.
The Peloncillo range, lower and very arid, sharply limits the horizon eastward, distant about twenty miles.
The next range westward is the Dragoon Mountains, fully thirty miles away.
These ranges are separated by mesa having an elevation of about 5,000 feet, but lower in the middle.
The northwestern end of the range is known as the Dos Cabezas Mountains, being separated from the main range by a depression to 5,500 feet near Fort Bowie.
The mountains as far south as White Tail Canyon are rather arid, the trees stunted oaks and pinons, with small beech, walnut, willow, buttonwood, etc., in the canyons.
The Cave Creek region is much more verdant and at elevations of 8,000 feet and over there are fine pine and spruce forests.
1 The mountains are rugged, almost everywhere cut into sharp ridges and peaks, the slopes steep and stony or rocky, often broken by cliffs.
The accompanying map gives a general idea of the positions of the various valleys or canyons mentioned herein.
Various maps of single canyons give the locations of collecting stations.
2 1 For an account of the flora of the Chiricahuas see J. C. Blumer, The Plant Geography of the Chiricahua Mountains, Science, XXX, p. 720, November 19, 1909.
2 The general map of the range and that of Cave Creek Canyon were drawn from sketches made by both authors, with some few additions to the general map from a map of the Chiricahua Forest Reserve, published by the Forest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, 1906.
This map is very inaccurate in many details, yet useful in the absence of anything better.

The conditions of molluscan life are likely to remain undisturbed for many years.
We have herein given an account of the present status of the molluscan fauna as full as circumstances permitted.
In many of the canyons we have endeavored to locate the individual snail colonies with sufficient detail to insure their recognition by subsequent observers, so that their further evolution may be followed.
Large areas still remain to be explored, and neither author has had time to fully study the material collected.
The first record of mollusks from the Chiricahuas was made by Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, who in 1890 describes specimens of Holospira arizonensis, 3 collected by Mr. Vernon Bailey for the U. S. Department of Agriculturejat Dos Cabezas, in the western foothills of the Dos Cabezas Mountains.
In 1895 Dr. W. H. Dall described Polygyra chiricahuana and subsequently (1897) he reported Pyramidula striatella, Thysanophora ingersolli and Zonitoides arborea,* all from Fly's Park in the central Chiricahuas.
collected by Dr. Fisher.
No other species were known from the range prior to the first visit by Mr. Ferriss in February, 1904.
Numerous new species were found during this brief visit, notwithstanding the unfavorable season.
In November, 1906, both of us collected in the range, exploring the principal canyons from Buckeye in the north to Cave Creek and the parks about its head.
In November, 1907, Messrs. Ferriss and L. E. Daniels spent two weeks in the Chiricahuas, and in 1908, from September 20 to November 15, Ferriss continued the work of exploring the southern canyons.
I.
Conditions Determining the Isolation of Snail Colonies.
The faunas of the several mountain ranges of southern Arizona are separated one from another by the intervening nearly level mesa, where snails are absolutely wanting and cannot exist.
This is due not alone to their greater aridity, higher temperature and xerophytic flora, but chiefly we believe to the absence of rocks, in the interstices of which snails might burrow below the dry surface to depths where a certain amount of moisture is retained.
The mesa forms a barrier as impassable to land snails as an equal expanse of sea; and can be surmounted only by minute forms light enough to be transported by the wind.
During the existence of the present conditions, w r hich probably were initiated in the Pliocene, the larger snails of each range have been absolutely isolated.
Owing to the general north and south trend of the ranges, the main canyons run eastward or westward, thus exposing a very hot slope 3 Proc.

Museum, XIII, 1890.
4 Proc.
U. S. Nat.
Museum, XVIII, 1895, and XIX, 1897. with little vegetation northward and a more shaded slope on the south side, having more vegetation, but deeply interrupted by side canyons and ravines.
These conditions may be illustrated by the map of White Tail Canyon (p. 75).
It will be noticed thereon that on the southern side of the canyon the collecting stations are nearly all on northwestern slopes, none on northeastern.
The latter are barren, and except near the top of the ridge form impassable barriers to mollusks.
In the more arid portion of the range, snails are rarely found, often wholly wanting, on the slopes with mainly southern exposure.
These conditions of exposure determine the limits of snail colonies, absolutely inhibiting migrations of much extent, though the anastomosing heads of adjacent canyons sometimes supply favorable slopes.
The isolation of snail colonies is further favored by the habits of most of the Helices, which live deep in rocky talus or slides.
They probably crawl about in the open only on rare occasions, and are wholly incapable of crossing slopes where shelter is lacking.
We have never found living Helices on the surface in the Chiricahua Mountains, and with the exception of Oreohelix chiricahuana, living individuals were always found well buried in the rocks.
Of some species, not even dead shells have been found on the surface.
Some of these races apparently live and die under the surface.
The progressive growth of the canyons by the deepening of lateral ravines and formation of new ones constantly accentuates the isolation of colonies by forming new slopes, of which one in each case is likely to be arid and therefore a barrier to the spread of snails.
Moreover, the removal by erosion of stratified rocks, especially limestone, exposes ridges of granitic or eruptive rocks, in which snails are generally scarce, and some genera never present.
Since the period of isolation of the several ranges, there has therefore been progressive isolation of colonies within each range.
II.
Influence of Environment on the Shell.
Relation of Climate to Shell-texture.
— Notwithstanding the aridity of the climate, the Chiricanuan snails show none of the characteristics which some recent authors have considered to be the direct reactions to the desert environment.
With the exception of Oreohelix chiricahuana, none of the species are conspicuously earthy, and none differ markedly in sculpture from snails of more humid districts.
Rude, irregular sculpture and opaque chalky substance characterize land snails which live exposed to the sun.
In such places their active life and periods of growth are certainly limited to dewy nights and times of ram, 5 whether they live in a reasonably humid region, as Cerion on the coast of Cuba, or in an arid region, as some Oreohelices of the Rocky Mountains.
Pulmo'nate land snails which pass their lives hidden from the sun or shaded by dense foliage, do not have notably chalky shells, even in Arizona where a great part of the year is dry.
We regard the opacity and cretaceous texture of exposed snails as in no way due to the direct action of climatic factors, 6 but as a protective adaptation to excessive sunlight, which would readily penetrate thin shells, or those composed largely of conchiolin.
7 Oreohelix chiricahuana and in some cases Holospira are the only Chiricahuan snails which live on or close to the surface, uncovered or only partially protected; these are also the only snails which have the shell notably chalky and opaque.
The snails of the dryest (Dos Cabezas) part of the range are not "desert snails" in appearance.
They live where little light or none can penetrate.
Relation of Exposure to Size.
— The size of individual snails (excepting the heliophilous group discussed above) is almost wholly a function of the exposure.
Snails living on northern or northwestern exposures are invariably larger than those from southern or eastern exposures, regardless of elevation, 8 unless other conditions are conspicuously unfavorable.
This is apparently due to the more abundant cryptogamic or other plant food, the growth of which is favored by the more humid slopes, 9 as well as the greater duration of humid growing periods.
As would naturally be expected, the difference in size of the snails is more marked in rather dry or semi-arid regions than in those abundantly watered and shaded.
Our measurements of Sonorella support the observations already published on other species.
In some cases the divergence has proceeded so far that diversity of size becomes an important specific character, as in the case of Sonorella leucura and micra, living on opposite sides of White Tail 5 Additions to the shell are made only when the animal is active, during humid periods, and thus exposed neither to arid winds or alkaline dust.
Growth of the shell does not proceed when the snail is retracted and at rest, but only when it is in full activity, with the mantle fullv produced.
6 As claimed by Dr. W. H. Dall, Proc.
A. N. S. Phila.. 1896, pp.
411, etc.
7 A long list of conspicuously opaque, chalky snails which aestivate in the full glare of the sun could be given.
We may mention Leucochroa, Cerion incanum maritimum, etc., Bulimulus alternatus, Oreohelix strigosa huachucana.
Allied species which live in more shaded places tend to lose their opacity; cf.
Oreohelix barbata and 0. clappi.
8 At least within limits of two or three thousand feet.
9 We have already given data in support of this fact in Proc.
A. N. S., Phila., 1906, pp.
552-555, and in other places.
Canyon.
Where snails are gathered from one limited region and those from various colonies are not kept separate, the measurements of such series when plotted may form conspicuously bimodal curves, due to the mixture of shells from different exposures.
Such results are entirely worthless in the study of the relations of organism to environment.
We have made no exhaustive series of measurements to ascertain whether the height of the spire varies with elevation of the station, but such observations as we have made indicate that it does not.
In the helices there is rather wide individual variation in height of spire at all levels indifferently.
10 Influence of the Character of the Rock.
— Land snails are notoriously more abundant on limestone than where the country rock is igneous.
They are also usually heavier, the shell-walls thicker, though this is not the case with all species.
The individuals apparently reach at least as large a size where lime is scarce as where it is abundant, if other conditions (exposure and humidity) are about equal.
In several cases the largest individuals occurred under granitic rock, as in the case of Sonorella bicipitis at Nine-mile water-hole.
Enemies.
— Field mice are apparently the chief enemies of the larger snails of the Chiricahuas.
We often found unmistakable evidences of their destructive activity.
The crevices of rock-piles which harbor most of the snails are often accessible to mice; and no protective device seems to have arisen effective against the latter.
Oreohelix barbata, which from the dirt on its hairy coat is rather hard to see, we noticed on several occasions had been cruelly preyed upon by mice.
We can offer observations upon predacious insects.
III.
Factors in the Formation of Races and Species.
The several modifications of the shells which we have noted above as correlated to some extent with external factors are only in minor part such features as serve to signalize species.
11 Thus in Sonorella the species are based mainly upon characters of the genitalia.
In Ashmunella upon the teeth of the aperture and the shape of the last whorl.
In Holospira the shape of the spire and its sculpture are the chief differential features.
Moreover, in many cases, allied but 10 Bellini's recent claim that on Capri the snails from greater elevations have higher spires, due to diminished atmospheric pressure, seems to us fantastic in the extreme.
11 In White Tail Canyon, however, Sonorella micro, and Ashmunella lepiderma differ from their fellows on the more shaded side of the canyon by features mainly traceable to the different exposure and rock.
4 distinct species live under conditions which so far as we can see are identical.
The subterranean Sonorellas, such as bicipitis, optata, bowiensis and leucura inhabit slopes having similar exposure, vegetation, elevation, and rock cover, yet they differ characteristically in genitalia.
At the same time, one style of genital organs seems to be as fit as another.
Nearly all of the Holospiras live in very similar places.
The local differences in the stations of the typical colonies of Oreohelix cMricakmna, obsoleta and pcrcarinata are apparently less than the differences between the several stations of colonies of chincahuana.
If the conditions seem practically identical on parallel slopes of different canyons, it seems hopeless to search for differential conditions among several rock-piles or taluses along one canyon side, having the same exposure, composed of the same rocks, separated perhaps only by arid gulleys or barren 'earth slopes; yet such taluses often harbor perceptibly different colonies of the same species.
The facts developed in our Arizona work lead us to doubt the potency of environment as a direct agent in effecting specific differentiation, or at least to assign such factors a wholly subsidiary role.
The facts seem explicable only on the hypothesis of variations existing or arising in the constitution of the egg, leading to modifications of the adult organism which for the greater part are indifferent as affecting the well-being'of the race.
Such adaptation as exists would apparently be due to selection.
The isolation of small colonies in these mountains must favor the survival of what are currently called mutations occurring therein.
The occasional mingling of neighboring colonies in which diverse variations have arisen seems to have led to such heterogeneous colonies as we have described in Holospira.
12 We have no definite evidence to offer bearing upon the amplitude of individual variations or "mutations," yet we may again mention the fact that in many species nearly every colony has its minor peculiarities — peculiarities far below the grade usually called "specific," yet appreciable to the trained eye.
13 It may be inferred from this fact that the amplitude of "mutations" is ordinarily not great.
IV.
Distribution of Chiricahuan Mollusks.
The snail fauna of the Chiricahuas consists of 51 species, falling into two main categories : 12 We believe this to be the explanation of the diversity of colonies in the polychromatic arboreal snails such as Partula and Liguus, in which some colonies of a given species are homogeneous, while others are heterogeneous, snails of several definite color-patterns being the offspring of a single mother.
13 Only the application of careful biometric methods can fully or definitely bring out these minute differences.
1.
Species peculiar to the range: all forms of the genera Sonorella, Oreohelix, Ashmunella and Holospira, 21 species with 14 subspecies.
These are the larger snails of the fauna, without exception larger and heavier than any of the snails ranging also outside of the Chiricahuas.
The members of tnis group of forms have probably been isolated in these mountains since the beginning of the present climatic cycle.
They are too heavy to be transported across the mesa by wind, and the probability that they would be carried by birds or other accidental means is so remote as to be negligible.
All of them were apparently derived from not more than six ancestral specific stocks ; the species of Ashmunella and Holospira forming homogeneous groups probably of common ancestry, while in Sonorella and Oreohelix the species fall into two groups.
2.
Species having a distribution outside of the range: all of them smaller than the preceding and many minute.
(a) Alpine forms, mainly living above 7,500 feet, and elsewhere found only in the Canadian zone of the Rocky Mountains northward.
Those found also in the Huachuca range are indicated by the letter H. Thysanophora ingersollimeridioncdis.
Vertigo columbiana utahensis.
Vitrina cdaskana, H. " modesta parietal is, H. Euconulus fulvus alaskensis, H. " coloradoensisbasidens.
Pyramidula cronkhitei, H. (6) Transition zone forms chiefly having an almost continental distribution in that zone, also ranging into higher and lower zones.
Zonitoides arbor ea, about 8,000 feet, H. Cochlicopa lubrica, 6,000-8,000 feet, H. Pupilla hebes, 7,500-8,000 feet, H. Vertigo milium, 8,000 feet, H. Succinea avara, about 6,500 feet, H. The species of groups (a) and (b) are forms which from their wide distribution must be of considerable antiquity, all probably having existed practically unchanged since before the initiation of present climatic conditions in Arizona.
The absence of any form of the Oreohelix strigosa group is remarkable, on account of the very wide distribution of this Transition zone type in the Rocky Mountains.
(c) Upper Sonoran species, most of them widely distributed in the Southwest, some ranging into the Lower Sonoran.

With the single exception of Agriolimax, all of these are very small or minute snails, certainly capable of being carried long distances by cyclonic winds, and it is likely that their wide distribution may be attributed in part to such means, though it is not improbable that a considerable number of the forms may have existed before the isolation of the Arizona ranges.
Twenty-two of the thirty species of groups 2 (a, b, c) have been found in the Huachuca range.
16 These are indicated in the list above by the letter H. Four species, marked F in the list, occur in the far poorer fauna of the Florida Mountains.
Faunal zones represented in the Chiricahuas are the Canadian, the Transition, and the Upper Sonoran.
Zones dependent upon elevation are less distinctly marked in mollusks than in plants or vertebrates, local exposure and suitable conditions of moisture controlling the distribution of species to such an extent that the elevation zones are extremely irregular.
It appears, however, that the Canadian zone forms are strictly confined to the high "parks" and peaks.
The characteristic Transition zone 'species are also for the most part high on the range, as are also five species which, from their distribution elsewhere, are considered to be Upper Sonoran.
Seven of the eighteen Upper Sonoran species have been found only below 7,000 feet, while six have a general range.
In the group of species peculiar to the Chiricahua range, and which must apparently be considered Upper Sonoran, many of the forms are very local in distribution and belong to the middle and lower zones ■of the range.
Those having a wider distribution often have a great vertical range, as the following examples: 14 Found only low, below 7,000 feet.
15 As yet found only at about 8,000 feet or above, but none of them known from much further north than the Chiricahua range.

Sonorella virilis, 6,000 to 9,000 feet, Oreohelix clappi, 6,000 to over 8,000 feet.
Ashmunella chiricahuana, 6,000 to 8,500 feet. "
angulata, 6,000 to over 8,000 feet.
Sonorella virilis leucura, S. micro, Ashmunella proximo, A. fissidens and their subspecies, and Holospira, seem, in their several areas, to range from low to as high as suitable cover and slope-exposure are found.
Ashmunella esuritor, metamorphosa and duplicidens belong to the higher levels (where the flora is very different), while A. ferrissi has not been found over 6,500 feet, if so high as that, In general, the specially Canadian and Transition species seem to be more sharply limited in their range downward than the Upper Sonoran forms are in their extension upward.
We attribute this as much to the difference in plant life as to any more direct climatic conditions.
The Lower Sonoran zone, in this area, has no land molluscan fauna, but Physa and Lymncea occur in the cienega east of the Chiricahuas.
V. Systematic Descriptions of Species.
Family HELIClDiE.
This family comprises four genera in Arizona: Sonorella Pils., Oreohelix Pils., Ashmunella Pils.
and Ckll., and Thysanophora Strebel.
Ashmunella is confined to a comparatively small area in the southeastern corner of the territory; but the other genera extend to the northern border, but they are only locally distributed, and some or all may be absent over areas of hundreds of square miles.
Ashmunella and Sonorella are Upper Sonoran genera, Oreohelix belongs to the Transition zone, often extending into the Canadian (where it is usually dwarfed), and sometimes into the Upper Sonoran zone, where it is mainly represented by special species.
The genera Ashmunella and Sonorella are curiously diverse in modes of racial differentiation.
In Ashmunella the shell has been most modified.
In series of allied forms from successive canyons of a single range the shells will show much greater divergence than the soft parts.
This is well illustrated by the Huachucan series, which, with conspicuous differences among the shells, shows hardly any in the soft parts.
In Sonorella, on the other hand, the shells from a series of successive canyons may show barely perceptible differences, but the genitalia have been so modified in detail that the species are instantly recognizable from these organs.
The conditions in Sonorella form a strong argument against modification by the action of environment.
The differentiation affects internal organs concerned solely in the act of reproduction, and only in the most remote manner connected with parts directly acted upon by external factors.
Genus SONORELLA Pilsbry.
Sonorella is the most characteristic Helicid snail of the mountains of southern New Mexico and Arizona.
It is more widely distributed than either Ashmunella or Oreohelix, inhabiting mountains too arid to support either of the other genera, such as the Peloncillo, Dos Cabezas and Rincon ranges.
In the Grand Canyon of the Colorado we dug them from the cruelly sharp rock-slides of the pre-Cambrian zone, in deep, sunless canyonwhere no other snails penetrate; and they exist equally on the plateau at the rim, 5,000 feet above the sea.
Tins tolerance of untoward conditions is doubtless due in part to their deep digging habit.
Sonorella is usually found well down in the rocky talus or slide, in the layer against the earth, where a certain degree of moisture remains.
In some places Ashmunella accompanies Sonorella in the same slides.
This Is especially the case in the more verdant and humid canyons, such as Cave Creek in the Chiricahuas, where Sonorella, Ashmunella and Oreohelix clappi may be found together.
Oreohelix (except 0. clappi and 0. barbata) lives on the surface, on or under the top stones, or around dead mescal, bear grass or yuccas.
While apparently fitted to live in exposed and extreme^ arid places, yet in southern Arizona Oreohelix certainly does not inhabit the more arid ranges where Sonorella exists.
Oreohelix and Ashmunella may sometimes be collected in copious quantity, but Sonorella is almost always rare.
In the Dos Cabezas range a half dozen living adults would be a good day's bag for any collector, and in dry weather, at least, this would mean very hard work.
In le^s arid localities the snails are less scarce; but as a general rule to collect living Sonorellas successfully is the most strenuous physical labor, occasionally enlivened by danger of broken limbs from falling rocks or caving in of holes, in slides of heavy rock.
Strong gloves are necessary in " quarrying" for Sonorella.
In spite of strained muscles, bruises and bleeding fingers, the fascination of Sonorella hunting is irresistible.
The game gains in value from the hardihood brought out in the chase, and it is only after one has forgotten the labor that he can part with a single specimen of the rarer species.
Chiricahuan Sonorellas belong to two very diverse groups distinguished as follows : Key to Chiricahuan Species of Sonorella.

94,328 A. N. S. P., from Buckeye Canyon, Dos Cabezas range of the Chiricahua Mountains, at Station 1, fig.
3.
It ranges throughout Buckeye and Happy Camp Canyons, and at Nine-mile Water-hole, living deep under stones and rocks.
Buckeye Canyon is the first from the northern end of the range.
Its upper branches drain the eastern flanks of Dos Cabezas Peak.
At the time of our visit in November there was water at intervals in the stony bed of the canyon as far down as our camp, near the reduction plant of the Buckeye gold mine.
Tarbox and Happy Camp Canyons unite into a wide valley about a mile from the mesa.
The mouth of this valley is half closed by a great reef of light gray granite rocks which forms a conspicuous landmark from the mesa.
The country rock of these canyons is mainly metamorphic, but in part granitic.
This species has the same apical sculpture as S. bowiensis and S. optima.
It differs from optima in the shape of the penis-papilla, the presence of a flagellum, the shorter inner cusp of the marginal teeth, the larger aperture and narrower umbilicus.
S. hachitana from the Big Hachet Mountains has a decidedly smaller aperture.
In shell characters S. bicipitis stands nearest S. huachucana, but the apical sculpture of the latter is much less distinct, without the oblique threads on the last embryonic whorl which are characteristic of S. bicipitis and related forms.
This species is represented by 43 adult shells, of which 17 were taken alive, and many young ones.
The colonies are widely separated 17 and small; living shells are rare, and their collection involves the removal of much rock.
The physical conditions are very similar in all the stations in Buckeye and Happy Camp Canyons.
All the stations are on steep well-drained slopes facing northward, the earth very dry (in November), even under a couple of feet of rock, and scantily protected by low scrubby oak brush.
At Nine-mile Water-hole the conditions are quite different as noted below.
In the type locality, Station 1 (pi.

In a lot of 23 from Station 3 (No.

Doubtless a longer search would show that a large number of small colonies exist.

Nine-mile Water-hole is a shallow amphitheatre open eastward to the mesa, its slopes covered with great weathered boulders of coarsegrained light gray granite, among which ferns grow luxuriantly.
A tiny stream trickles among the rocks, collecting into a stagnant pool at the base.
A man can make his way in the interstices between and under the rocks, in some places, but as very few of them are movable, it is almost impossible to obtain the shells.
Specimens were dissected from Stations 1, 3, 4, 5 and from Nine-mile Water-hole.
All have a distinct sheath at the base of the penis, attached also to the epiphallus and partially enveloping the latter throughout a part of its length.
This sheath varies from about onethird the length of the penis in the type lot, to about a half in that from Nine-mile.
The penis-papilla in transverse section (fig.
7, pp.)
shows a group of minute ducts, but there seems to be a single terminal orifice.
The vagina is longer in the types than in other lots examined.

The shell is umbilicate, umbilicus slightly less than one-seventh the diameter, similar to S. hachitana.
Pale brown, fading to whitish around the umbilicus, encircled by a rather wide dark chestnut band above the periphery, bordered above and below with paler, whitish bands.
The spire is low conic.
Whorls 5 \, slowly increasing to the last, which is much wider, and descends deeply in front.
The embryonic shell consists of H whorls.
The first half whorl has radial wrinkles, and begins in a smooth tip ; then a small areolate area follows, after which there are curved, forwardly descending delicate threads reaching the suture below, but weak or obsolete on the summit of the whorl, which is irregularly roughened; there are also some forwardly ascending threads in places.
The first neanic whorl has sculpture of slight growth ripples and an indistinct roughening or punctation.
Subse■quent whorls are lightly marked with growth-lines only.
The aperture is very oblique, subcircular; peristome thin, a little expanded, narrowly reflexed below, the columellar margin dilated.

Radula with 35, 1, 35 (summit of Cross J Mt.)
to 38, 1, 38 teeth, about 14 laterals, an ectocone appearing on the 11th to 13th.
The entocone is bifid on the outer 15 to 18 marginals, and the ectocone occasionally so on some teeth, though generally simple.
Six radulse from 5 stations examined.
The jaw has 5 ribs in two, 6 and 7 in two other examples.
The crops and oesophagus as far as the stomach are conspicuously sulcate or corrugated longitudinally.
Type locality, head of Big Emigrant Canyon at Station 1, on a steep slope shaded by pinyons, under large stones (limestone).
The species occurs in numerous colonies throughout Big Emigrant Canyon, except on slopes with southern exposure.
See map on p. 121.
This handsome species, like others of the hachitana group, is illcharacterized as far as the shell is concerned, but the genitalia are characteristic by the small penis and absence of a free flagellum.
In the Chiricahua Mountains it is related to S. bicipitis of the Dos Cabezas range, but in that the penis is well developed and the flagellum, though small, seems to be invariably present.
In all of the numerous examples opened the crop and intestine to the stomach are deeply furrowed longitudinally, a condition observed in no other Sonorella.
To what extent this corrugation may be due to the state of the specimens is uncertain.
It happened that by some unaccountable oversight all of the Big Emigrant Sonorellas were cooked and pulled without drowning, and then were preserved in alcohol too strong to give the best results.
All of the following colonies but one are on limestone.

Station 3.
Big Emigrant Mountain.
This name is given to a mountain about four miles above the fork of Big Emigrant Canyon on the left side of the east branch.
November 11 and 12 it was visited.
On the side toward the canyon, under a rocky bluff, under stones among scrub oaks (Queixus hypoleucal) , in a situation resembling that of Sonorella bowiensis, numerous specimens of a small form were taken, almost all dead shells.

Forty-one living and twenty-eight dead adult specimens were taken at the type locality in 1906.
It is a very pretty shell, quite constant in all its characters.
The shell is somewhat transparent, pale corneous-brown becoming lighter almost corneous-whitish near the umbilicus.
There are usually one or two obliquely radial whitish streaks on the last whorl.
The chestnut band above the periphery is about one millimeter wide, is visible on 2^ to 3 whorls, and has a very faint paler border below, hardly visible; no noticeable pale border above the band.
Whorls 4^, rather slowly widening to the last, which is nearly double the width of the preceding, and well rounded peripherally.
The embryonic shell consists of U whorls; the apex is smoothish; then a radially wrinkled area follows to the end of the first half whorl; the next whorl has forwardly descending delicate threads on its outer or peripheral half, the inner half being irregularly, shallowly pitted and roughened.
The succeeding neanic whorls are lightly striate obliquely and very slightly, minutely roughened.
The last whorl descends rather deeply in front .
The umbilicus is contained about 5h times in the diameter of the shell.
The aperture is very oblique, peristome expanded, the ends strongly converging, the columellar end dilated, slightly impinging on the umbilicus.
Measurements of seven specimens were given in our former paper, with diameters of 15 to 17.8 mm.

Type locality.
— Quartzite Hill, back of Dixon's place, about a mile south of old Fort Bowie.
It has been found nowhere else.
The locality was wrongly given as "Bowie" in our former paper.
Bowie is a station on the S. P. Railway about 15 miles from Fort Bowie, and on the mesa where no snails live.
Fort Bowie is now deserted, and only the roofless adobe buildings and the cemetery remain.
Sonorella bowiensis was found only in one colony very limited in extent but prolific in individuals.
This colony — the only place where we have ever found Sonorella in abundance — is in a small thicket of long-leaved scrub-oaks with some underbrush of service berries (Amelanchier sp.)
under a low cliff, somewhat more than half way to 18 The concentration around the diameters 16 and 17 mm.
is partly due to the fact that all shells more than 15.8 and less than 16.2 were counted as 16, and similarly with 17, giving a wider range than with any intermediate measurements.
the summit of Quartzite Hill, back of Dixon's place, shown at (1) in the photographic reproduction below.
The snails were under small stones and dead leaves.
The abundant shelter and food and favorable northeastern slope apparently led to an unusual multiplication of individuals, but no environmental factor seems to account for their very small size.
We searched the neighboring Bull Hill thoroughly for Sonorella, but without success.
Probably a more extended exploration would result in finding other colonies in the Fort Bowie Valley.
Bowie Mountain and Helen's Doom should be examined.
The single locality of S. bowiensis lies between the ranges of S. bicipitis and S. optnta.
Fig.
5.
— Quartzite Peak and Bull Hill, from the ridge on east side of the creek, looking across Dixon's place, showing type localities of Sonorella bowiensis (1) and Holospira cionella (2).
S. bowiensis differs from S. bicipitis by the rounded end of the penispapilla and the actually and comparatively longer penis, over half the length of spermatheca and duct, though the shell is smaller.
The shell differs by its smaller size and the faintness or absence of white bands bordering the chestnut zone.
The living animal is slate color on head and back, sides of foot pale blue, borders of the foot orange; liver brown.
In alcohol the back is slate, sides, tail and sole whitish.
The sole has slightly darker lateral areas marked off with faint grooves.
The crop is long and smooth.
I have figured the genitalia of a specimen (pi.
IV, fig.
6) for comparison with that previously published.
The well-developed penis has a long basal sheath, the lower part of the penis itself being quite slender.
The papilla is cylindric, somewhat more than one-third the length of the penis, with a blunt, rounded end.
The penis retractor is long.
The organs measure as follows: length of penis 12 mm.
; of penis-papilla 4.4 mm.
; epiphallus and flagellum 12; flagellum 0.6; vagina 10; spermatheca and duct 21.5 mm.
The atrium is extremely short.
In its genitalia this species resembles S. binneyi from the southern end of the range, and to a less extent S. rowelli.
The embryonic sculpture is like that of S. bicipitis, but the spirally protractive threads are more numerous and closer.
S. binneyi differs from S. bowiensis by the very much smaller penis, only half the length of that of S. bowiensis in a larger shell; by the different shape of the papilla, and the absence or very minute size of the flagellum.
The shell also is invariably larger than S. bowiensis, even in the most arid situations.

Group of Sonorella virilis.
These forms are distinguished from all other Helices known to us by the enormous length of the penis and its papilla, Sonorella rinconensis, which has an equally long penis, but a comparatively short papilla, is apparently the most nearly related species.
All other known Sonorellas have the penis short or of moderate length.
All known species of this group are Chiricahuan.
The sculpture of the embryonic shell resembles that of the group of S. hachitana, but usually the pattern is very indistinct, Sonorella virilis Pils.

S. virilis Pils., Proc.
A. N. S.
Phila., 1905, p. 266, with var.
circumstriata, p. 267.
This species was described from a single shell which so far as we can learn was probably taken in Rucker Canyon.
The variety circumstriatawas described from the talus at the foot of Reed's Mountain, about a half mile below Reed's place, Station 11 in Cave Creek.
The series now available shows that this variety is scarcely distinct enough for recognition, or at least that it is difficult to decide upon some specimens.
Figures 1, 2, 3 represent specimens from Station 11, at the foot of Reed's Mountain, Cave Creek Canyon.
Figs.
4, 5 are from about two miles up the south fork of Cave Creek.
All of these are of the form circumstriata.
Fig.
6 is from Spring branch near Rucker Camp, head of Rucker Canyon.
This shell, and others from the head of Rucker, has a broad conspicuous white border above the brown band, a narrower one below it; the brown band is broader than in Cave Creek shells.
The spire, viewed from above, is narrower, the last whorl therefore wider.
Specimens from further down Rucker have much less conspicuous white bordere along the band, and are like the type of virilis.
This species also occurs in Morse Canyon, tne foot of Bonito Canyon, and Shake Gulch, and in Horseshoe Canyon near the Red Box.
In the Cave Creek Canyon Valley it may be found almost anywhere suitable rock cover exists, though there are large areas without it, where the slope is slight or with southern exposure.
Rock "slides" or northern exposures with abundant rock are its chief haunts.
It was taken at Stations 3, 4, 5, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, also near the branch leading toward Paradise, in the ravines west of Reed's Mountain, and various places throughout the South Fork as far a^ explored — about two miles up.
None were taken on the great ridge where Stations 6 and 7 are situated, or on the ridge marked 10.
The valley south of the stream from the falls has not been explored.
The Sonorellas were also found in a great rock slide (trachyte?)
on the south side of a peak near the sawmill, in Barfoot Park, Station 1, and in the head of the adjacent canyon running westward.
See map on p. 107.
S. inrilis (circumstriata) was found also in Paradise Canyon about two miles below Paradise, and in Pine Canyon.
Variation.
— There is the usual variation in degree of elevation of the spire, and slight variation in ground color of the shell, in all of the lots examined, but various colonies differ in size, as may be seen by the table of measurements of specimens from four places.
This size variation is not in the least correlated with elevation, but is invariably connected with the exposure to the sun.
Thus it will be noted that at Stations 1 and 12 the mode is at 18 mm.
diameter, the total range from 16 to 20 mm.
Both of these stations are on sunny southern slopes, Station 1 being Barfoot Park at an elevation of over 8,000 feet, while Station 12 is only about 100 feet above the bottom of Cave 1910.]
71 Creek, at an elevation of about 6,000 feet.
These small specimens contrast with those from Stations 13, from shaded slopes, where the mode is at 20 to 20.5 mm., and the range from 17.75 to 21 mm.
Large shells occur at Station 11, at the shaded and humid base of Ried's Mountain, about 6,000 feet elevation, and at the head of Pine Canyon, at about 8,000 feet, also in a comparatively humid and well-shaded situation.
The shells from other places, while too few to be worth tabulating, or to give reliable curves, support the above conclusions as far as they go.

The penis is longer than in the original type specimen, but in about the same proportion to the length of the vagina, which varies considerably.
This difference in length is perhaps due to the different modes of preservation.
The basal sheath of the penis and its retractor are both quite short.
The arcuate shape of the penis is due to its position near the periphery of the last whorl when the animal is retracted.

The shell is decidedly more depressed than S. virilis or S. v. "circumstriata," though the spire is about equally convex; the umbilicus is wider; the aperture is smaller, and the ground-color is paler, subopaque, whitish, tinted more or less with brown, nearly white on each side of the dark band, and pale around the umbilicus.
Embryonic and neanic stages.
— There are If embryonic whorls.
The depressed tip is smoothish, followed by only a few radial wrinkles; following embryonic whorl is roughened with low granules lengthened in a radial direction, or short, irregularly waved or vermiculate radial wrinkles ; over these there is a pattern of grains in regular squares at first, but soon forming protractive rows, the grains becoming indistinct.
On the first post-nepionic whorl the fine striae are more or less interrupted or minutely indented in places.
The post-nepionic whorls as far as the fourth whorl are clothed with very short deciduous hairs, so delicate that the slightest attempt to clean the shell removes them, and they probably never persist in the adult stage.
All immature specimens taken by us in November, from diam.
10 mm.
on, have a strong callous rib within the lip-edge.
Adult stage.
— There are 4^ whorls in small, 4f in large individuals of the type lot, slowly increasing at first, the last whorl seen from above about twice as wide as the penultimate.
The lip is blunt with rusty edge, but not thickened within.
The outer margin is slightly expanded, the basal a trifle more so; parietal callus rather thick at the edge, straight.
The umbilicus contained about 5.2 times in the total diameter.

This is the only Sonorella on the southern side of White Tail Canyon, living on steep slopes varying from northeast to north or northwest.
It occurs (in November) rather deep under rocks, and excepting on the more arid slopes and ridges, colonies may be found where suitable shelter occurs throughout the length of the canyon, generally rather high on the slopes, but in at least one case only about 20 feet above the bed of the canyon.
The more favorable slopes, such as those Stations 5, 14, 15 are situated on, are wooded with pinyon below, oak and a few long-leaf pine above.
The ridges and slopes with southern or eastern exposure are barren or nearly so.
The rock is limestone, mostly with covering of earth and fine stone, and there are no rock slides.
Stations 1, 2, 4, and 9 are decidedly more arid and barren than 5 and 14, Station 5 being near the bottom of a deep narrow ravine, densely wooded, while Station 14 is on a steep shady northern slope.
The lots taken show that the shells respond to more favorable conditions by reaching a larger size, as seen in the table of measurements.
The shells from Station 5 have the spire somewhat more depressed than any other lot.
Those from near Jim Artels' old camp, near head of White Tail not far from Station 1 , are the smallest.
The table following shows the shells from high on the ridge (Stations 1 and 4) to be in the main smaller than those from the mid-slope ; but this ridge becomes very dry above, with less shade, while the slope lower down is well shaded on northwest exposures (caused by the lateral washes and ravines, running northward), the northeast exposures being for the most part barren.
The size of individuals in the colonies collected appear, therefore, to be related to the amount of shade and moisture.

When absolutely unworn they bear delicate hairs in young shells.
The following post-embryonic whorls are delicately striate, and as far as the beginning of the fourth whorl, fresh and uncleaned young shells have close, short and very delicate hairs.
The last whorl has delicate growth-lines, but no trace of spiral stria?

This is the smallest Sonorella yet known from the Chiricahuas.
It is allied to S. virilis by the genitalia and the indistinct sculpture pattern on the embryonic whorls, but differs by its diminutive size, thin shell, comparatively narrower umbilicus and the absence of distinct white borders along the brown band.
S. micra occupies the north side of White Tail Canyon to the exclusion of S. virilis leucura, which lives on the opposite or south side.
It lives in "slides" of angular, dark purplish-gray rock (rhyolite), together with Ashmunella lepiderma, and can be found only deep in the rocks, where they rest on the earth below.
The slopes are mainly toward the south and west, hence exposed to the direct sun, rarely shaded to any extent by the small trees.
The snails are found from the bottom of the canyon (Station 11) to perhaps 6,800 feet (Station 16), where they occur over the crest of the ridge, in an extensive slide sloping northward.
The type locality, Station 10, is below the great cliffs along Indian Creek.
The lower stations are easily accessible, but the higher call for arduous climbing and, from the nature of their haunts, the work of quarrying the snails out is severe.
We secured but few living specimens, but many dead shells, more or less fresh, show the species to be remarkably constant.
Besides a slight variation in elevation of the spire, no variation in form is noticeable.

77 S. micra occurs associated with Ashmunella lepiderma in the same rock slides.
Both are modified in the same manner, the shell differing from allied species in being smaller, thinner, dull, with a greater or less development of cuticular processes.
The reduced size compared with the species on the opposite side of the canyon is without much doubt due to the sun-scorched exposure.
We have not found that living on igneous rock has any tendency to dwarf Sonorellas, though the tenuity of the shell may fairly be attributed to that influence.

The Chiricahua Mountains harbor two groups of Oreohelix with a well-developed nearly black, green or yellow cuticle, so far unknown elsewhere.
In one of these, the barbata group, the shell is bi-convex, with whorls of small calibre, a wide umbilical cavity and numerous spiral wreaths of cuticular fringes.
The other, the 0. clappi group, has an orbicular shell usually banded, with large tubular whorls and & smaller, rapidly diminishing umbilicus.
In one of the forms both the cuticle and the shell beneath possess well-defined spirals similar to the cuticular fringes of O. barbata; but here the likeness ends.
In general appearance these Chiricahuan forms have little resemblance to groups of Oreohelix in the Huachucas or elsewhere.
The clappi group further differs from the 0. strigosa group in possessing radially costulate apical whorls.
Snails of both of these groups live immured in the shaded rocks of the mountain "slides," composed of broken rock or spawls tumbled down from the peaks above.
0. clappi lives from 5,000 to 7,000 feet, and O. barbata from 7,000 to 10,000 feet above the sea.
The dead shells are seldom found upon the surface.
Oreohelix chiricahuana, in the same mountain range, requires but little covering, and is found in dry situations, often with but a single leaf or a small spawl for protection.
It agrees with the Oreohelices of other regions in having a very thin cuticle, often wanting.
Dead agavas and yuccas furnish a home for these, the Holospiras and Succinea avara; but 0. barbata and O. clappi, the Ashmunellas and Sonorellas require an atmosphere with more moisture, and dwell from one to two feet below the surface.
He who finds must dig.
All Chiricahuan Oreohelices are confined to that range, and none of them are closely related to species found elsewhere.
All are conspicuously variable in each colony and in different colonies, nearly every one of which shows a degree of racial differentiation, so that one acquainted with these shells, even as imperfectly known at present, could locate himself if lost in the Chiricahuas by digging for ( )reohelices !
No adequate discussion of these shells can be entered into without more and better illustrations than are possible to us at this time, and long series of measurements.
We have merely indicated briefly the salient features of each colony.
The Oreohelix clappi series.
The group of local races which for taxonomic purposes is considered to compose the species O. clappi comprises about a dozen colonies, scattered over the range for a distance of about 44 miles.
The relationships of the snails of these colonies may be expressed diagramatically thus : Emigrans — Onion Creek — Reed's Mt.
— type Cataracta Horseshoe — Shake Gulch — Rucker Box The forms toward the left in this diagram are successively more roughly sculptured, toward the right they are smoother.
The type happened to be of intermediate character, and near the central point of the range of the species.
The upper line forms a variation-series extending from Big Emigrant Canyon {emigrans) to the Falls of 1910.]
79 Cave Creek (cataracta).
The lower line Is a similar but independent chain from the southern canyons, a considerable distance from the nearest of the more northern group.
From Big Emigrant Canyon to Shake Gulch the Stations mentioned above run in a general direction from northwest to southeast.
From the emigrans station to Onion Creek station is about 16 miles; thence to Cave Creek, 4; to Cave Creek Falls (var.
cataracta), 2; to Rucker Box, 12; to Shake Gulch, 12.
Total, 44 miles as the crow flies; but it is 55 by trail.
One peculiarity runs throughout the entire clappi series: they are hard to catch.
Except at Onion Creek the} r were grouped in small families and the families did not seem to be upon speaking terms.
They were clannish and confined their travels to one particular rock slide.
In only two instances was the same form found in two slides of rock, though the rocks were well explored for miles around.
At Onion Creek they were plentiful; about 100 were collected there in an hour.
Oreohelix clappi emigrans n. subsp.
This shell is similar in outline to 0. clappi, but more sharply angular at the periphery, or even carinate in front.
Cuticle thicker, rough, usually persistent, dark olive brown in color, lusterless, not banded, coated and caked with a deposit of humus.
The sculpture after the embryonic shell consists of oblique, uneven, rather sharp striae, and Fig.

on the last whorl some coarse wrinkles.
The striae are sharper than in 0. clappi and close together up to the last whorl; on the base they are thread-like, crimped and waved at the intersections of four or five circular rows of short cuticular appendages, which are usually retained only on the latter part of the base.
In immature shells the threadlike striae are surmounted by delicate cuticular laminae, more or less felted together by the adhering dirt.
The aperture is roundedpiriform, the lip margins converging, thickened at the ends and connected by a thin film across the parietal wall.
Interior bluish white.

Big Emigrant Mountain, on the south side of Big Emigrant Canyon, at about 7,000 feet elevation, taken in some numbers in a shattered column of stone and also in a rock slide.
This place is about 20 miles across the mountains northwest from the Cave Creek Station for O. clappi.
O. c. emigrans is the dirtiest of the group — in its natural state as black as the soil.
It is well distinguished by the sculpture, and would be considered a separate species in a less variable group than Oreohelix.

The shell is moderately depressed, with tubular whorls and deep suture, the altitude about two-thirds t he diameter and about equally convex above and 1 >el< >w the peripheral angle.
The umbilicus at the opening is about one-sixth the diameter and contracts rapidly, only the penultimate whorl visible.
Calcareous layer of the shell is brownish white under a thin greenish-yellow cuticle with some darker oblique streaks, which become in mature shells darker and crowded near the aperture.
Many possess two indistinct transparent olive spiral bands, one above, the other just below the periphery.
In old individuals the cuticle remains only in ragged shreds.
The first \\ embryonic whorls are strongly ribbed radially; these riblets are regular and narrower than their intervals.
At the end of the embryonic shell the whorl slightly widens abruptly, with sculpture of rather coarse irregular obliquely radial wrinkles and traces of fine spiral striae.
The last whorl has unequal, irregularly spaced oblique wrinkles, iccak and loic at the base, which is densely covered with minute wavy spiral stria?, obsolete in old individuals.
Where the wrinkles pass over the angular periphery they are sometimes somewhat more emphatic, a little pinched up.
There are no spaced circular threads or cuticular fringes on the base.
Whorls 4f, convex, the last double the width of the preceding.
Base very convex.
The aperture is very shortly ovate or nearly circular, very oblique, and about one-half the diameter of the shell.
The ends of the lips converge.
The short parietal callus is a thin transparent film, or in old shells the peristome is continuous, as a raised parietal ledge.
Old age is expressed by a deeper descent of the last whorl and closer approach of the lip margins, as usual in the genus Oreohelix.

About 30 specimens.
In its native state 0. clappi is covered with humus, perhaps attached by mucus.
But few specimens were found except in the type Station.
Its habit of burying deeply in the soil probably accounts for its rarity.
Elsewhere in Cave Creek Canyon a slightly different form (see below) was found in 1906 at Stations 9, 11, 12, near 13, 14 and in the ravine west of Reed's Mountain.
These stations are all near the bottom of the canyon.
It was not found higher up.
Here it occurs with Sonorella, Ashmunella chiricahuana, A. ferrissi and A. angiilata.

Lower Cave Creek Form.
— The shells taken in 1906 at Stations 9, 11.
12 and near 13, 14, Cave Creek, are slightly more angular at the periphery than the types, and the growth-wrinkles bear short cuticular lamellae where they pass over the peripheral angle in fresh and unrubbed individuals not fully mature.
Often, but not always, there are three circular rows of inconspicuous granules at wide, equal intervals on the base, a weak or vanishing development of the basal sculpture of 0. c. emigrans.
The two brown bands (one at the outer third of the upper surface of the last whorl, the other below and near to the peripheral angle) are usually more distinct than in the type lot of clappi.

Onion Creek Form.
— This form resembles the second form from Cave Creek and 0. c. emigrans in shape.
Compared with 0. clappi the whorls are natter, less convex, sutures not so deep.
The last whorl invariably falls to the aperture further below the angle of the preceding whorl, and the peripheral angle continues strong as far as the lip-edge.
Cuticle thin, persistent, not ragged or broken, light greenish olive, lustreless, with occasional dark oblique lines, which, near the aperture, become crowded.
It is seldom banded spirally and then the bands are indistinct, obscure brown and transparent.
The growth-striae are sharper, more distinct than in Cave Creek clappi.
It is very densely and distinctly striated, spirally.
Oblique waved riblets and traces of spiral wreaths on the base, as in 0. c. emigrans, are shown in young shells, and sometimes upon the penultimate whorl of the mature shell within the aperture, but seldom pei'sistent upon the exterior.
There are nearly 5 whorls.
The aperture is pear-shaped, its upper margin nearly straight (consequent upon the flatness of the whorls); Fig.

It was found in a shattered column of quartzite in company with Ashmunella, Sonorella, Succinea avara and two rattle-snakes, Crotalus pricei and C. lepidus.
Oreohelix chiricahuana dwelt in the limestone over the ridge, less than a half mile distant.
The station is about 4 miles from the locality of 0. clappi and 16 from that of 0. c. emigrans, and upon a direct line between the two.
This is the greenest in color of the group, the texture of the cuticle is the most harsh and it is the largest in diameter.
4.
Form from Rucker Canyon.
— The sculpture in this form is weak, the oblique wrinkles smooth, in part effaced, and lower on the base; spiral striation weak or subobsolete, hardly noticeable above.
Cuticle glossy, persistent, varying from rather bright green or greenishyellow to brownish-olive, the two brown bands distinct.
There are sometimes two fainter bands, one above, the other on the base.
The last whorl is only very obtusely angular, the angle, well rounded, usually falls less in front than in the Onion Creek lot.
The aperture is conspicuously longer than in typical 0. clappi; upper margin decidedly arched.
In old shells the lip-ends approach closely, but are not connected as in the typical 0. clappi, the callus between them remaining thin and transparent.
Up to 3+ whorls the young carry five strong cuticular fringes below, one at the periphery and one above.
The cuticle in larger shells is smooth.

The last whorl is even more rounded peripherally than in typical 0. clappi.
In 1908 it was found in a deep gulch, the "box" of Rucker Canyon, at about 8,000 feet elevation, on both sides of the stream in sliding rock, where the atmosphere was as moist as the stations on Cave Creek, about 12 miles distant.
It is a near neighbor with O. barbata, a small form of the latter being plentiful at the twin caverns in the box, while O. clappi was found half a mile farther down the stream.
5.
Shake Gulch Form.
— The shell is sharply angular peripherallv, the angle becoming obtuse near the lip; whorls flattened above; cuticle dull, lusterless, persistent, obscure olive at the base, the upper surface with a russet suffusion, peristome black-bordered.
There are one or two faint bands.
The surface is obliquely, rather obtusely, wrinkled, the base distinctly striate spirally, growth-lines low, not waved.
The sculpture of the embryonic shell is very weak, and seems closer than usual.
Unfortunately, no young examples were taken.
This form is usually more depressed than that from Onion Creek, with less sharp oblique sculpture.
It resembles the remote Onion Creek colony in the lusterless cuticle.

— Similar to the preceding except that the peripheral angle is less acute; between the Shake Gulch and Rucker lots in form.
Fragments of a long cuticular fringe remain in ■places in the suture from the third whorl to near the aperture, but there are no spiral series of granules or cuticular prominences on the base, thereby differing from O. c. emigrans, and like the forms geographically nearest.

The range or this species extends from Emigrant Canyon to Limestone Mountain, a distance of about 50 miles.
Its range is markedly discontinuous towards the north and south ends, but from White Tail to Cave Creek Canyons the colonies are not widely separated.
It is always found on limestone, never where the country rock is metamorphic or igneous.
The several races differ as follows : 86 [Feb. tt.
— .Sculpture of sharp fine striae along the lines of growth, conspicuous on the base, where there are also spiral stria?
and some widely spaced larger spirals.

The type locality is on the slope with southern exposure below the cave in Cave Creek Canyon, Station S on map, p. 107.
The dry ravine has steep sides of steeply dipping, more or less calcareous shale and earth formed by its.
decomposition.
The dead shells are profusely scattered; living onas are under dead mescal (Agave), sot ol (Dasylirion) and bear-grass, with Thysanophora horni, Succinea avara, Vitrea Fig.

The shells are very uniform in size: Alt 6 6.8 6.5 6.5 6.8 6.8 mm.
Diam 11.1 11 11 11 10.5 11.5 mm.
The shells are white, with the earlier whorls flesh-tinted, a faint fleshy-corneous band at the outer third of the top of the last whorl, which has two grayish or fleshy corneous bands on the outer half of the base or a general fleshy corneous suffusion there.
A scalariform mutation rarely occurs.
From the cave we found large colonies at intervals westward nearly to the western rim of the valley, at Stations 5, 6 and 7 on map, p. 107.
At Station 5, on a steep north slope along the creek, under rocks, about 3 miles west of the cave, the shells are similar but larger, 12 to 13 mm.
in diameter.
At Station 6, about half way up the north side of the limestone ridge, the shells were like those from the cave in size, but somewhat whiter, more calcareous.
Near and at the top of the ridge, along the southern side, east and west of station 7, 0. chiricahuana is widely distributed.
The shells here are like those from Station 6, but smaller, the largest 10 mm.
in diameter.
This colony is probably 1,500 feet higher than the cave.
The smaller size of the shells from Station 7 may probably be correlated with a dryer and hotter habitat.
How far down the south slope it extends we did not learn.
We found 0. chiricahuana now r here else in Cave Creek Canyon, nor has the typical form been encountered elsewhere.

Summit of Cross J Mountain near the mouth of Big Emigrant Canyon, Station 5 on map, p. 121.
November 12, 1906.
This locality is farther north than any other known colony of Oreohelix in the Chiricahua range.
The Oreohelices were found around the summit, which is probably about 7,500 feet elevation, and along the ridge northward, down about 500 feet, but not in the valley (Station 6), where Sonorella lives.
This slope of the mountain is limestone, becoming cherty above, but the summit is angular, friable quartzite (?
), among the fragments of which the Oreohelices live.
None were found on the ridge running toward the mouth of the canyon, which is composed of a disintegrating, coarse-grained granitic rock.
There is little vegetation of any kind on the upper part of Cross J Mountain.
The station is rocky, barren and exposed.
The snails are moderately abundant, though living ones are hard to get.
Paradise Canyon.
On the south side, about two miles below the town of Paradise, Oreohelix was found in some abundance, but owing to the snow which covered the ground at the time we camped there (November 20) but few living examples were taken.
The form is almost identical with that of Cross J Mountain, the adult differing only in having the radial striation on the base a little more regular, and the major spirals, of w T hich there are three or four, often somewhat stronger, though in some shells they are hardly noticeable.
In young and half-grown shells a thin cuticular thread runs along the summit of each of the striae, and at the intersections of the major spirals these threads rise in short triangular processes.
This feature was not observed in the shells from Cross J Mountain.
Another similar lot was taken on the northern slope of the canyon.
These places are probably not far from the 6,000 feet contour, being thus much lower than Cross J Mountain.
The separation of these colonies from the Cross J Mountain colony of 0. c. percarinata probably indicates independent evolution of the same characteristics, since an area occupied by 0. chiricahuana obsoleta lies between Big Emigrant and Paradise Canyons.

In White Tail Canyon, this form of 0. chiricahuana was taken at Stations 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14 — all on the southern side except 3, which is just over the crest of the ridge on the Pinery side.
The sculpture is rather rude and blunt, the striation less sharp than in the Cave Creek form, being effaced or subobsolete especially on the base where spiral lines are wanting or rarely weakly indicated, while Cave Creek chiricahuana has sharp, subregular striation and distinct spirals.
Two or three inner whorls are brown, the rest being white with some faint gray streaks and scattered dots.
Whorls 5| to 5| (4^ in typical chiricahuana), the last carinated as in chiricahuana.
The shape varies from typical to decidedly more elevated, and the size everywhere exceeds that of Cave Creek shells.

Shells from Stations 1,2,6,7,8, 12 agree with those from 14.
These stations are on rather steep slopes with generally northern exposure, and from somewhat over 6,000 to about 7.000 feet elevation.
The distribution over this area is nearly or quite continuous.
At Station 3, just over the crest of the ridge, on the Pinery Canyon side, probably a little over 7,000 feet elevation, the shells are smaller, 11.8 to 13 mm.

This station is very high and exposed, on a sunny slope, hence extremely dry and arid; but the following record shows that mere elevation is not a factor of importance.

The station is deficient in herbage, more barren than higher up the slopes.
In the Box Canyon of White Tail we found a colony which differed from all other lots of the White Tail region in sculpture, the striation being distinct and rather sharp on the base, as in typical chiricahuana, and with very weak traces of fine spiral lines.
The peripheral keel projects more, approaching the shape of the race from Big Emigrant Canyon; otherwise the shape, size and number of whorls is as in 0. c. obsoleta.
The conditions at this station were unfortunately not noted particularly.
No specimens of this shell were taken by Ferriss and Daniels in 1907, as they did not explore the limestone ridges.
In 1908 Ferriss and Pomeroy found it again in Hand's Pass, over the range from White Tail, in the head of Pinery Canyon.
The embryonic shell is strongly, regularly ribbed.
The shell has b\ whorls, rounded, arcuate, keel nearly obsolete near the aperture in mature shells; aperture nearly round, the angle formed by the peripheral keel hardly perceptible.

The major spirals upon the under surface are represented by very low, obtuse ridges.
The keel becomes very obtuse on the last whorl near the aperture.
O. c. obsoleta was also found in the head of Onion Creek (between Paradise and Jhu Canyons).
In 1907 Mr. Ferriss passed over the wide part of the range from Paradise to the mouth of Rucker Canyon and Shake Gulch, some 25 miles from the Cave Creek Station, and here again O. c. obsoleta (fig.
13 b, c) was found in a foothill known as Limestone Mountain, about ten miles in length and some 7,000 or 7,500 feet above the sea.

As the hill became higher the shells were larger and more numerous.
Here also was found a toothed form of Ashmunella and also Pupa?
and other of the smaller species.
The mountain is composed entirely of limestone, upon the northern slope at least.
Rocky cliffs and talus gave the snails ample shelter.
Between this station and the Cave Creek Station, about 25 miles distant, there are no limestone exposures and no Oreohelix chiricahuana.

Twenty colonies of this species have been found, all between the head of the southeast fork of Pinery Canyon and the Rucker "box," at elevations of not less than 7,000 feet, and within a distance of twelve miles in length and two to three miles in width.
They dwell upon all sides of these high peaks in the rock slides or talus, and among the rocks upon the slopes of the gulches and ravines.
Ferriss and Daniels found the most robust specimens living under from two to three feet of rock well covered over with sod, with the most perfect specimens of Ashmunella chiricahuana, a toothed Ashmunella, Sonorella, virilis and the little mountain rattle-snake, Crotalus pricei.
In Cave Creek Canyon they often occur under one or two feet of rock.
In their own territory Ashmunella, Sonorella and the other forms of Oreohelix are usually to be found wherever the conditions are favorable ; but it is not so with O. clappi and O. barbata.
These snails are found only by chance, in isolated colonies, and these colonies are usually divided into families, the old pair and their spring crop of all sizes when not fully matured live together.
Every colony as a rule has some peculiarity.

— O. barbata, denuded shell from Cave Creek, Station 4. in color from pale greenish to dark reddish brown, some with wide indistinct red bands.
Many lose their fringes and part of the cuticle before maturity.
In (me colony the shells were entirely naked.
The rows of cuticular fringes vary in number from five to ten.
In size, the shells are from 1-U mm.
diameter down to 10 mm.
in the race minima.
Elevation above the sea apparently does not control size.
The smaller forms usually dwell at 10,000 feet, and the largest at 7,000, but a pigmy form was found at the lowest altitude, and the most robust at about 8.500 feet.
The deflection or dropping of the last whorl at the aperture is not uniform or consistent in any colony, but it has significance in connection with the proportion of individuals so modified.
In some colonies, as that in Cave Creek, the last whorl as a general rule drops very little, while in Barfoot Park it usually descends deeply.
In Cave Creek Canyon this species is confined to the border and slope of the western escarpment.
Ferriss (1904) took the types in the talus half a mile below the falls of Cave Creek.
These have 4£ whorls, and are pale greenish ; the cuticular laminae light russet.
There are four to six, usually five, circular wreaths of triangular cuticular scales, one small one being midway between periphery and suture, but often wanting, one at periphery, and three or four on the base.

In 1906 we found almost similar specimens at Station 4 (marked by two dots on the map, p. 107), darker in color, with sometimes as many as eight cuticular wreaths, sharply carinated or angular at the periphery.
These were on a well-shaded northern slope, under rocks in a coarse talus.
This place is two or three hundred feet above the bed of the "wash" and about one hundred below the cliffs, just opposite a little grove of aspens among the oak scrub, which form a conspicuous landmark near the head of the "wash," from their rarity in this canyon.
The snails here had been preyed upon by the mice.
In Turkey Creek near the head of one of the eastern branches at an elevation of about S.500 feet, Ferriss and Daniels took fully developed examples in 1907 (pi.

They were found in a talus upon an eastern slope of a steep mountain side, and possessed the best developed, longest and most persistent cuticular wreaths.
A second colony in the head of one of the eastern forks of Turkey Creek, found in 1908, approaches more closely the Barfoot Park series.

— In Barfoot Park, Rustler's Park, at about 9,000 feet, a slide at the head of Turkey Creek, Ash fork of Cave Creek, Snow-shed Mountain at the head of Cave Creek, and the head of Rock Creek, a form occurs in which the shell is smaller than typical O. barbata and in fully adult shells the last whorl often descends the full width of the former whorl: the periphery also is somewhat less sharply angular, and becomes almost rounded near the aperture.

Genus ASHMUNELLA Pils.
and Ckll.
A study of the genitalia of Chiricahuan Ashmunellas leads to the conclusion that all the species of that range are of common ancestry, and more closely related inter se than any are to New Mexican or Huachucan species.
In other words, the specific differentiation has been mainly subsequent to the isolation of this fauna.
In both Chiricahuan and Huachucan species the penis is bipartite, consisting of an upper and a lower portion separated by a submedian constriction.
In the Huachucan series the upper segment is enlarged like the lower (see plate XX, Proc.
A. N. 8.
Phila., 1909).
In Chiricahuan forms the upper segment of the penis is very narroiv, hardly larger than the epiph alius, but its distal end is invariably a little swollen, and contracts abruptly where it passes into the epiphallus 20 .
The penis retractor is extremely short in Chiricahuan species, longer in Huachucan.
The spermatheca is more or less varicose in Huachucan species, but this is hardly apparent in Chiricahuan forms.
The vagina in the Chiricahuan series is swollen and muscular in its upper part, smaller with thinner walls below.
In other respects the organs are alike in the two series.
These considerations lead to the conclusion that the whole Chiricahuan series of Ashmunella constitutes one phylum, the Huachucan series another.
Doubtless the two phyla were of common ancestry; but their evolution on the two parallel mountain ranges has been independent.
The extraordinary resemblances between some Chiricahuan and Huachucan species, which led us in 1905 to 20 The slender upper continuation of the penis was not always recognized in our former (1905; work on Chiricahuan snails, although once understood it is clear enough.

unite some of them specifically, 21 are wholly due to evolution along parallel lines in the two stocks.
This orthogenet ic evolution has resulted in the most extraordinary parallelism.
By degeneration of the teeth of the aperture, wholly toothless forms have arisen as terminal evolution products in both phyla; and these are so similar in shell-characters that they are indistinguishable.
Other forms in both phyla have evolved a Y-shaped parietal tooth, like that of Polygyra.
While the shell is extremely conservative in Sonorclla, in the related genus Ashmunella it appears to be the most plastic part of the organism.
As in Polygyra and many other molluscan groups in which complex hard parts have been evolved, many races and species are characterized by varying degrees of degeneration of the teeth of the aperture.
In the current phraseology, this may be due to the action of an inhibiting factor, earlier or later checking the development of teeth.
This seems to have taken place independently in most of the centres of Ashmunella evolution.
Toothless apertures are no doubt primitive in the Belogenous Helices, so that secondarily simplified forms, such as A. varicijera and A. chiricahuana, have completed an evolution cycle, returning to the primitive simplicity of aperture.
Whether such forms can give rise to new series having dentate apertures remains uncertain.

3 Group of Ashmunella proximo.
From Old Fort Bowie these forms extend southeastward to the end of the Chiricahua range.
Northward beyond the depression at the Fort, in the Dos Cabezas end of the range, no Ashmunella has been found.
The mountains here are apparently too barren and dry for Ashmunella, though they support the more hardy Sonorellas.
The colonies seem to be small and widely separated in the area northwestward of White Tail Canyon, but much of that country remains to be explored, especially between Big Emigrant and White Tail Canyons, as well as the entire region of the southwestern watershed.
A. ferrissi and A. angulata are distinct from the others by their flattened whorls and conspicuously compressed outer basal tooth.
The other species are intimately related, and their variations make a complexly branching form-chain.
An adequate study of the material in hand, some thousands of shells, would require more ample time than we can give.
Since not half of the territory is adequately covered by our series, we must leave full consideration of the subject for another occasion.
Our knowledge of the forms from Rucker and Horseshoe Canyons and the region around them is still very defective.
The forms seem to be related somewhat, as shown in the following diagram : proximo.
emigrans lepiderma pomeroyi, albicauda — fissidens duplicidens If a single basal tooth is primitive, then A. duplicidens is the least evolved member of the series and of the whole Chiricahuan group of Ashmunellas.
Then A. proxima and lepiderma would be the most evolved.
All of the forms with more or less concrescent basal teeth are extremely variable in the degree of union of these teeth.
Every colony of fissidens, emigrans, albicauda, pomeroyi and duplicidens shows great individual variation in this respect.
There seems to be complete intergradation between the separated basal teeth of proxima and the united teeth or single tooth of fissidens and duplicidens.

See map on p. 75.
Genitalia are of the type usual in the fissidens group.
The epiphallus and spermatheca are a little shorter, proportionately, than in A. p. albicauda or emigrans.
Measurements of the organs of three individuals may be found in the table on p. 97.
The mantle within the last whorl is cream-white with a few inconspicuous gray dots; collar pale slate-tinted.
This species, of which several hundred specimens were taken, inhabits suitable rock-slides over the whole northern side of White Tail Canyon.
At Station 11 it occurs close to the bottom of the canyon, and only a short distance from where .4. fissidens is found on the opposite side.
The slopes of this side of the canyon are steep, interrupted by cliffs, and the heights are difficult of access.
At Station 16 there are extensive rock slides sloping northward towards the mesa, and perhaps 1,500 feet higher than Station 11.
Here it passes over the ridge and inhabits the opposite slope.
While belonging to the fissidens group, this species is very distinct by its sculpture of cuticular scales, the strong carination, thin texture, etc.
The young shells form only a weak callous rib within the lip at resting periods.
At all the stations there is considerable variation in size and, as in all Chiricahua Ashmunellas, the height of the spire varies a good deal among individuals of any colony.
At Station 17 the shells average smaller than in other places, about 4x10.3 mm.
; but a few are as large as 11.5 mm.
diameter and many as small as 9.5 mm.
The scale-like sculpture is especially well developed in shells from this station.
In some colonies the cuticular scales are minute, sparse or even wanting in adult shells.
At Hand's Pass, at the head of Jhu Canyon, this species reappears.
The surface is regularly very minutely pustulate, some perfectly fresh shells having minute cuticular appendages on the pustules in places.
There are also some cuticular spiral hair-lines on the base.

This colony is separated from the type locality by the whole southern slope of White Tail Canyon, where lepiderma certainly does not occur.
We have considered the possibility that the Hand's Pass form may be an independent convergent modification of the proxima stock; but in the absence of alcoholic material permitting a full comparison this hypothesis must remain in abeyance.

This species was described from "Sawmill Canyon," otherwise known as Rigg's or Pine Canyon, where the senior author collected it in 1904.
We did not find it there in 1906, but our search was impeded by snow.
We found it near Fort Bowie in company with Sonorella bowiensis.
The exact locality Is a little thicket of long-leaved scrub oaks, just below a low rock-wall, somewhat more than half-way up "Quartzite Hill."
on the side facing Dixon's house, shown at (1) in the sketch on p. 67.
This is about a mile from Old Fort Bowie.
Similar shells were also taken at Crook's Peak (Ferriss and Daniels) in 1907; only two specimens.
In ranking A. proxima as a subspecies of A. levettei, a wrong estimate was made of its affinities.
It is related to A. fissidens and duplicidens, but differs from both by having two distinctly separated teeth on the basal lip.
A. levettei angigyra stands very near proxima in shell-characters, but the lower end of the tooth within the outer lip runs inward in angigyra, while in proxima the free edge of this tooth rims parallel with the peristome.
In angigyra the outer-basal and outer lip tooth are usually closer together than are the two basal teeth.
This is not the case in proxima, in which the three teeth are about equally spaced.
In soft anatomy the two are quite distinct.
A. I. angigyra has a far longer penis of different shape and a shorter epiph alius and vagina than A. proxima; moreover, angigyra has a radula with more teeth, and 1910.]
101 there are more ribs on the jaw.
The shell is corneous-brown, subacutely angular at the periphery, the angle weakening on the last part of the whorl, behind the lip, where the surface is more strongly striate.
Spire convex.
There are 6^ to 6+ very slowly widening, slightly convex whorls, the last descending somewhat in front.
The aperture has a rather long, concave-topped tooth within the outer lip, its face concave.
The basal lip has two tubercular teeth, a little compressed laterally, the inner one smaller.
These teeth divide the lower border of the aperture into three nearly equal bays.
The parietal tooth is straight or slightly bent inward at the axial end; never V-shaped, as it frequently is in .4. fissidens.
Parietal callus thin.
The umbilicus is rather wide, contained 4| times in the diameter of the shell.
The surface is rather dull, finely striate, the striae appearing more or less Fig.

In perfectly fresh young shells a delicate pattern of minute low granules on the upper surface may be seen with some difficulty.
Si .me very weak traces of spiral striamay sometimes be made out on the base.
The young shells have a callous rib within the lip, at resting stages, but it is apparently not formed as frequently as in A. fissidens.
The genitalia were figured hi 1905, pi.

Having again examined the individual dissected, we note that the penis was incorrectly drawn.
The swollen basal half is everted (as in pi.

The slender upper portion of the penis is shown, its distal end indicated by a slight node, only indistinctly drawn in my figure.
With these corrections, it will be seen that the organs are like those of emigrans, fissidens and albicavda.

Southern forms resembling A. proximo.
— Raspberry Gulch.
A few specimens in poor condition are intermediate between proximo and fissidens as to the basal teeth, but the umbilicus is much narrower than in either, and the peripheral angulation is less pronounced, thus approaching A. duplicidens.
There are over 6 whorls.
Other southern localities for forms of A. proximo are Rucker Canyon and "Turtle Head," a station between Crook's Peak and the mouth of Rucker.
.4. fissidens should by rights be subordinated to proximo, as a subspecies, on account of the various intermediate forms; yet the status of the races can be more clearly expressed by the artificial device of making it a "species."

The two basal teeth are less separated, somewhat united by a callus at their bases, and the inner one is generally smaller, frequently very small.
There is often the weak trace of an upper branch, making the parietal tooth V-shaped.
Fine spirals may be seen on the base of the shell.

Phila., 1905, p. 243.
This species was described from "dead" and discolored specimens, thought to be from Cave Creek Canyon, collected by one of us (Mr. Ferriss) in the course of a flying trip through the mountains in the winter of 1904.
In 1906 we collected extensively in Cave Creek; a year later Messrs. Ferriss and Daniels did additional work there, but nothing was seen of A. fissidens.
The location of the type colony, therefore, remains uncertain.
It is likely that the shells were picked up in White Tail Canyon, also hurriedly traversed in 1904.
While the prevalent form in White Tail differs from fissidens in several respects, yet near the head of the canyon some exactly similar shells were found by us in 1906.
A lot from near the head of the left branch (going up) (near Jim Artel's old camp) is typical fissidens; and we suggest that this be regarded as the type locality in case true fissidens is not hereafter found in Cave Creek.
In these shells the lip is not produced forward in an angle near the upper insertion, and the upper angle is not filled with a callus; the lip is narrow with rounded face; there is no upper branch developed on the parietal wall, unless very weakly in some old shells; there are fully 6 whorls; the young develop only a weak lip-rib at resting stages.
Certain forms from much further south, in Shake Gulch, the foot of Bonito Canyon and Limestone Mountain, seem to be referable to A. fisside?is; but they are less angular, becoming rounded behind the lip, and the umbilicus is decidedly smaller.
More material is needed to fix their status.
Ashmunella fissidens albicauda n. subsp.

The upper end of the parietal wall stands more or less free and the lip.
near its upper insertion, runs forward in an angle; the posterior angle of the aperture is heavily calloused, and the parietal tooth is usually V-shaped by development of a weak upper branch.
The young shells form a very thick and heavy callus within the lip at resting stages (fig.
19D).
Adult shells are invariabl}' acutely angular in front, the angle weakening and almost disappearing on the latter part of the whorl.
Behind the aperture the striation is stronger and sometimes amounts 104 [Feb., to an irregular costulation.
There is an angular gutter behind the basal lip, and the reddish-brown color gives place there to a wide buff stripe which borders the lip.
The whole base has a sculpture of extremely minute spiral lines in fresh examples ; and under the microscope a veiy minute spiral lineolation is seen between these spiral lines, which are readily visible with a hand lens.
The upper surface also snows very faint spiral lines in places, and there is often some c Fig.

105 shorter than in A. p. emigrans or A. duplicidens, but this may be an individual character.
A. f. albicauda is found in White Tail Canyon almost everywhere on the southern side, but not on the opposite slope of the canyon.
Specimens were taken at Stations 1 to 5, 9, 12, 14, on the south side of the Box Canyon and on the south side below Indian Creek, ranging from about 20 feet above the creek bed (at the last place) to about 7.500 feet elevation on the rim southward, where indeed it was taken at Station 3, which lies across the acute divide and on the Pinery side.
Not one single specimen was found on the north side of the canyon, where A. lepiderma replaces it, coming down to the bottom of the canyon.
The range of A. fissielens in the Pinery and Pinery Canj^on is unknown.
The great Pinery Valley lay before us in splendid panorama from the ridge south of White Tail Canyon and again from the ridge north of Barfoot Park.
Probably its ravines are inhabited by fissidens and perhaps forms connecting that with A. proxima.
It may be noted that the large Sonorella of White Tail Canyon is a race of S. virilis, of Barfoot Park, etc.
At all stations in White Tail Canyon where many shells were taken, the same variations in height of spire noted under .4. duplicidens were noticed.
Otherwise there is variation in the size of the outer lip-tool h and especially in that of the inner tubercle of the basal tooth.
The parietal tooth may be either straight at its axial end or abruptly curved inward, and, when turned inward, a low ridge usually runs to the outer end of the lip, making the parietal tooth V-shaped.

The shells are similar to those of White Tail Canyon in general appearance, but differ in certain particulars, constituting a minor race.
They are in the average smaller, diam.
8^ to 11^ mm., rarely 13 mm., with 5£ whorls; the umbilicus is noticeably wider; the lip is heavy and wide.
The basal teeth vary from completely united to distinctly bifid, as in White Tail fissidens, or rarely they are almost separated.
In most examples these teeth are more united than in White Tail specimens.
The shape of the parietal tooth also varies from V-shaped to simple.
All of the shells'are more angular and more depressed than A. duplicidens.

After the first H whorls the next four whorls more or less appear minutely punctate in the best preserved examples, though in most only an indistinctly interrupted condition of the striae can be made out.
Under the compound microscope some very fine close spiral striation is seen on the base.
The basal tooth is ordinarily doubled as in figs 5 and 8; but sometimes is simple, the inner tubercle being represented only by a sloping callus, as in figs.

Immature shells form only a thin narrow rib within the lip at resting stages .
and have a wider, somewhat less angular, aperture than A. fissidens.
This thin lip-rib is subsequently wholly, or almost wholly, absorbed, so that adult shells do not show whitish varix-streaks.

All of these figures are from topotypes, from Station 1 in Barfoot Park — an extensive slide of coarse rock on a southern exposure.

A. duplicidens stands veiy close to A. fissidens, but it differs by the more obtuse, though bluntly angular, last whorl, and by the youngshells, which form only a very thin, narrow rib within the lip in resting stages, while in fissidens a very strong and heavy callus is deposited.
The basal teeth are more united than in typical fissidens.
A. duplicidens, fissidens and proximo, are terms of one series of forms differing chiefly, so far as the adult shells are concerned, in the degree of separation of the basal tooth, which in duplicidens is a single more or less bifid prominence, while in proximo there are two distinct teeth.
When the canyons opening westward, between Rucker and Ft. Bowie, have supplied series of shells as copious as those we have obtained in the eastward canyons, another chapter may be added to the history of this group.

In the south fork of Cave Creek we found this species abundantly.
This is the type locality and here it attains the largest size.
A few dead ones were picked up on a mountain-side southeast of Paradise, towards Cave Creek, and at Station 12, in Cave Creek.
It reappears at the head of the canyon at the Falls, and at Stations 3 and 4 and in the head of Turkey Creek.
At these places the shells are smaller.
In 1907 Ferriss and Daniels took some specimens in Barfoot Park, Station la.
They are much less angular at the periphery than the Cave Creek form.
In 1908 it was taken in Horseshoe Canyon at the "Red Box" (10 miles up the canyon) and at "5-mile camp"; also in Rock Creek, at the head of Raspberry Gulch and in the Spring Branch of Rucker Canyon.
These localities greatly extend the range of the species.
The compressed outer basal tooth and less convex whorls readily separate A. angulata from .4. proximo.

The embryonic shell seems to comprise the first If whorls.
The initial half whorl is smooth and glossy ; then growth-striae begin below the suture, gradually extending over the whole width of the whorl.
The third and fourth whorls are very minutely indistinctly marked with subregularly arranged points, as though hairy in the immature stage, though none taken retain any hairs.
The rest of the whorls are finely striate.
The base also is marked with very fine, unequal growthstriae, and under a strong lens shows faint, extremely fine and close spiral striae.
These are also faintly visible in places on the upper surface.
The carina first appears above the suture at the end of the second whorl in some examples, in others at the end of the third.

Group of Ashmunella chiricahuana.
This group is distinguished by the very long spermatheca and epiph alius and the open aperture, which is either toothless or provided with minute vestigeal teeth which do not sensibly obstruct the opening.
.4. chiricahuana has never been found to have any trace of teeth.
It varies in size and degree of elevation of the aperture.
A. esuritor frequently retains minute vestiges of teeth, but they are variable and often hardly noticeable.
It is less evolved than A. chiricahuana in retaining this functionless reminiscence of the toothed ancestral form.
The series is exactly parallel to the .4. levettei-varicifera series in the Huachucas, but there the degeneration of teeth has been more recent and all stages of the process still exist.

This fine Ashmunella is widely distributed in Cave Creek Canyon, living on reasonably moist north slopes where there is good rock shelter, with Sonorella.
In 1906 we took specimens at Stations 3, 4, 5, 11 , and in the ravines west of Reed's Mountain between that and Station 10.
In 1907 and 1908 the following localities were added by Mr. Ferriss : Cave Creek Falls, head of Cave Creek near Long Park, Long Park at 8,000 feet.
The types were from the adjacent Fly's Park (No.
124,481 U. S. N. M.).
The figures published by Dr. Dall represent A. varicifera, a Huachucan species, and we have therefore given new illustrations.
The color varies from light brownish-corneous to light chestnut, and occasionally albinos are found.
The surface is veiy glossy.
Young specimens form a strong wide white rib within the lip when a resting stage occurs.
This persists as a yellow blotch or stripe in the adult stage.
Some specimens, as those from Cave Creek, Station 5, and the head of Cave Creek, show traces of punctation on the intermediate whorls not visible in most others.
The chief variation, aside from tint, is in the elevation of the spire.
Two examples, extremes of a continuous series, are figured to illustrate this (fig.
23 c, d), from about the middle of the amphitheatre west of Reed's Mountain.
This variation is not peculiar to any special colonies, though greater in some lots than others.

Specimens collected in 1907 have now been dissected.
The Huachucan form proves to be practically identical with A. levettei in the soft anatomy, and abundantly distinct from A. chiricahuana in the proportions of the organs, especially of the spermatheca and its duct, as will be seen by the following table: A. chiricahuana, Huachuca Mt.

Barfoot Park, collected by James H. Ferriss, February, 1904.
We have nothing to add to the description and figures of genitalia jaw and teeth given in 1905.
Having again examined the genitalia of the type, we see nothing to indicate that it is abnormal.
The possibility that it is the 9 phase of a proterandrous form has been considered, but the absence of such a condition in the other species of the genus makes against such hypothesis.
If normal, the genitalia of this snail indicate one of the most distinct Chiricahuan species, a penis and its retractor being absent, as in some slugs.
The lot originally referred to this species consisted of three specimens, two being included in Mus.
No.

The soft parts of one of these were mutilated and not preserved.
The other one has been dissected and proves to be A. esuritor.
When we were in Barfoot Park near the end of November, 1906, snow lay almost knee-deep among the big pine trees and living snails were hard to find.
Some dead shells (No.
97,930), taken in the head of Pine Canyon, may be metamorphosa, but we refer them for the present to A. esuritor.
No shells known to have the anatomical peculiarities of A. metamorphosa have been taken since 1904.
We have found no character in the shell to certainly distinguish A. metamorphosa from A. esuritor.
The latter varies from forms with a nearly simple lip, like A. cmricahuana, to those with various callous vestiges of teeth, as shown on the plate, figures 1 to 8.
Further collections of specimens in the flesh are needed.

This species differs from the typical forms of Thysanophora by the absence of cuticular laminae or hairs, the surface being clean and bright, with the appearance of a Vitrea.
Under very high magnification some spiral striae are visible on the intermediate whorls, but not on the first.
In the typical form, the aperture is narrowly lunate, the spire almost flat, umbilicus nearly one-fourth of the diameter, "Height 2.5, diam.
4 mm."
In many Colorado examples the umbilicus is narrower, about one-fifth the diameter of the shell.

Family UROCOPTID^J Pils.
Genus H0L0SPIRA von Martens.
All of the Holospiras now known from Arizona belong to a single group of closely related species, characterized by the light brown shell, having a stout lamella on the axis in the penultimate and first part of the last whorl, often in addition a superior or parietal lamella, and sometimes a basal lamella also.
In several of the forms the lamellae vary from one to three, as Ave have demonstrated by cutting from twenty to fifty individuals of a single colony.
In colonies so varying, the number of internal lamellae is not correllated with age, size or any other external feature of the shells, so far as we can discover, after collecting and examining hundreds of shells from a great number of colonies.
The subgeneric divisions {Eiulistemma, Tristemma) based upon the number of internal lamellae in shells of this type have, therefore, no basis in nature.
While the Arizona species differ somewhat from the Mexican type of the subgenus Bostrichocentrum in texture and sculpture, it does not seem that the differences are of subgeneric importance, and for the present we will place them in that group.
The variations in the internal lamellae recorded below are really less discontinuous than might be supposed by the tables.
The axial lamella is invariably present, but it varies in strength and length.
The superior lamella may be very strong and over a half whorl long, but in other individuals of the same colony it may be small or barely observable, so that the series from a strong lamella to none is practically a continuous one in some colonies, though usually this lamella is either distinctly developed or wholly wanting.
The same statement applies to the basal lamella, except that it is never very large and usually quite small and short when present.
The study of these races is extremely complex, and we have been unable to find time to enter upon it seriously.
Any full record of a form should take into account the number of ribs on a whorl or their distance apart, as well as the proportions of the shell, number of whorls, length of cone, and the lamellae.
(a) In many colonies a longer and a shorter form may be selected, with only few intergrading specimens; and there may also be a noticeable difference in sculpture.
Such colonies may perhaps be hybrid, composed of two incipient races.
(6) Different colonies in the same district, often living under apparently identical conditions, and frequently in close proximity, may show differences in size, ribbing or comparative frequency of certain combinations of lamella?, in fact, incipient racial divergence.
The mingling of two or more such colonies by their spread, aided by changing conditions of surface, may have given rise to colonies of the (a) type.
In some cases, where the colonies are widely separated, they have apparently evolved into reasonably distinct subspecies, probably in the alienee of int emigration.
The Cave Creek colonies of H. chiricahuana illustrate this.

Its latter part is straightened and runs forward shortly beyond the preceding whorl, the upper wall descending slightly.
Otherwise it is not noticeably contracted behind the aperture.
The outer lip is narrowly expanded and revolute, and is lined within with a rather thin white callus.
One living specimen in the lot is an albino, pure white with some bluish spots.

The types of this species came from near Old Fort Bowie.
The fort stands on the narrow and Ioav neck which unites the Dos Cabezas range with the Chiricahuas proper.
Only the adobe walls now stand; only the cemetery remains to be guarded!
The ridge has here a minimum elevation of 5,500 feet.
About a mile south Mr. Dixon's place lies in the valley east of two conical peaks, known as Bull Hill and Quartzite Peak, the former of cherty limestone formation.
Holospira cionella is found on the slope of Bull Hill facing the fort, the exact spot being along a tiny gully w T hich crosses the trail to the fort.
This place is indicated on the right at (3) in the photograph reproduced on page 67.
It probably has an elevation of 6,000 to 6,200 feet.
Another colony is on the lower slope of Quartzite Peak, toward Dixon's house, also indicated in the photograph at (2).
Specimens from this place agree most closely with the original types of cionella.
The figured types (pi.
XII, figs.
1, 2) are cylindric shells, evenly and rather finely but strongly rib striate, the striae not weaker on the latter whorls ; they are coarser on the swelling behind the contraction preceding the lip.
Out of 11 shells of the type lot opened, 9 have an axial lamella only; 2 have axial and superior or parietal lamellae.
When originally describing this species only a few specimens were opened, and all happened to have one lamella only.

The head and southern slope of White Tail Canyon are inhabited by a race closely related to C. cionella, but remarkably polymorphic.
The internal lamella?
vary from one to three, but in most colonies there are one or two, the former number predominating.
The sculpture is always coarse on the cone, but on the cylindric part it may be coarse, partially effaced, or fine, in specimens of the same colony, while in some other colonies one or other of these conditions may be developed separately.
The White Tail series deserves far more study than we have been able to find time for.
The shell differs from H. cionella by the perceptibly longer taper and coarser striation of the terminal cone, and slightly greater development of the basal crest.
In the form selected as type (pi.

The callus within the aperture is very heavy.

The type locality of H .
chiricahuana is on the steep slopes of a small dry ravine or wash tributary to Cave Creek, below and near the entrance of the cave.
The slope faces the south and is composed of very steeply dipping friable calcareous shale and earth formed by its decomposition, with sparse vegetation, agave, sotol and bear grass.
Dead shells are scattered in profusion, and the living ones lurk under bunches of dead bear grass, etc.
The colony is about one-eighth of a mile long and perhaps 100 yards wide.
This is also the type locality of Oreohelix chiricahuana.
Map on p. 107, Station 8.
A majority of the specimens (82 per cent.)
have a superior or parietal lamella from \ to h of a whorl long, on the roof of the penultimate whorl near its end, above the aperture or on the front side, but in some (18 per cent.)
this is wanting.
In those of the type lot formerly opened it was absent or very weak, but in others of the type lot, as well as in many topotypes opened, this lamella is more or less strongly developed.
The interior of the outer lip is very heavily thickened with a white callus within.
All forms of H. chiricahuana thus far found have the shell strongly ribbed throughout, with no tendency to become smoother on the cylindrical portion.
While in the type form of H. chiricahuana the internal lamellae are inconstant, yet in several other colonies localized in various parts of 128 [Feb., the Cave Creek Valley the lamellae seem to be constant, so far as we can judge from the limited material taken.
It must be remembered that many other colonies doubtless exist.
The additional locality, "Fort Bowie," given in our original account, was evidently due to some mixture of labels or specimens.
Thorough search in 1906 showed that it does not occur there.
The large specimen represented in pi.
XXVII, fig.
26, of our paper of 1905, was probably not from the type locality, but picked up somewhere else in Cave Creek Valley.

Genus EUCONULUS Reinhardt.
The term Euconulus was proposed by Reinhardt in 1883 for the typical group of Conulus, in which he included Kaliella.
Conulus being preoccupied, Pilsbry in 1900 27 substituted Euconulus for the generic group, with fulvus as type.
Dall, 1905, 28 has given the generic synonymy and references in full.
Mr. J. W. Taylor in his monograph of British land shells (1908) has discussed the varieties of E. fulvus.
His treatment of E. cher sinus as a variety of fulvus was evidently due to the lack of specimens, for the two forms are much less alike than the several small British species of Hyalinia which he distinguishes, and in fact are unusually distinct as species go among the small Zonitidae.
One of the European forms is apparently close to chersinus; but an intelligible exposition and revision of the Euconulus of Europe remains a desideratum.
There is no trustworthy record of Euconulus fulvus from Japan, though E. fulvus alasketisis may naturally be expected to occur in the Kuril Islands, Yesso and Saghalin.

Chiefly or wholly found at high elevations, and very rare in the region north of Cave Creek.
E. fulvus alaskensis differs chiefly from fulvus by having about one whorl less in shells of similar size.
On the first whorl the radial striae begin at the first fourth, and are about as close as on the rest of the shell.
There are no spiral striae on the first or later whorls.
The last whorl has 90 to 105 striae in 1 mm.
E. /.
alaskensis was described from Dyea Valley, Alaska.
It is also before us from Petropavlovsk, Kamchatka, collected by Dr. William H. Dall.
It extends southward in the Rocky Mountains to the Chiricahua and Huachuca ranges, in southern Arizona, chiefly at high elevations.

Mr. E. G. Vanatta has made a careful study of the American forms of Euconulus fulvus in order to determine the status of the Chiricahuan form, using high magnification to bring out the minute sculpture.
It appears that all the forms examined have a minute sculpture of excessively close, regular vertical striae, though in some examples it is less distinct than in others.
This sculpture, when strongly developed, lends a silk-like luster to the surface in quite fresh examples.
In E. fulvus from the northeastern United States the first whorl has fine spiral striae and very indistinct traces of vertical (radial) striae, not seen in some but legible, though weak, in other examples.
The upper surface of the last whorl has about 126 vertical striae in 1 mm., crossed by spiral striae.
There are about 6 whorls (figs.

133 It seems that there is considerable variation in the minute sculpture of E. fulvus, though it appears to be always somewhat coarser than in E. chersinus and, in the average at least, finer than in E. fulvus alaskensis.
Euconulus chersinus (Say) is, of course, a very distinct species from all of the preceding.
No conchologist who actually examines fulvus and chersinus with an ordinary hand lens could lump them.
Mr. Vanatta's study of the microscopic sculpture has shown that there is little real difference between chersinus and polygyralus, and we are Fig.

and Van.
In the central sierras, from the Grand Canyon of the Colorado to the Mexican State of Michoacan, a distance of over 1200 miles, the typical (or procera) group of Bifidaria gives place to a great extent to a group in which the angular and parietal lamella?
are less united, joined only at the inner end of the angular lamella.
The basal fold, when present, is radial, or transverse to the cavity.
This group is morphologically in a more primitive stage than the eastern Bifidariae, in which the angular and parietal lamellae are more completely concrescent.
Some of the species, however, have evolved very complicated apertures.
Such forms as B. perversa and B. ashmuni are to be viewed as highly evolved members of a low group.
Immersidens stands intermediate between Bifideria s. str.
and Sterkia.
In the latter group the angular and parietal lamellae are not united.
The following forms from Arizona and New Mexico belong here: Bifidaria perversa Sterki. "
ashmuni Sterki. "
ashmuni minor Sterki. "
cochisensis Pils.
and Ferr. "
cochisensis oligobasodon Pils.
and Ferr. "
dalliana Sterki. "
bilamellata Sterki and Clapp.
Bifidaria prototypus Pils., from Michoacan, Mexico, also belongs to the group, as a terminal member of a form-chain composed of ashmuni, cochisensis, oligobasodon, prototypus, which constitute successively simpler links in the chain.
Probably the great unknown mountain region of Northern Mexico will supply other members of the group.
In order to complete the account of B. ashmuni and its allies, forms from the Huachuca Mountains and elsewhere have been described and illustrated below.

The typical form of B. ashmuni is nearly cylindric, tapering but slightly, composed of five strongly convex whorls.
The last whorl becomes straightened and slightly sinuous in basal view, and has a more or less conspicuous oblique swelling or crest some distance behind the aperture.
This crest is not always so strong, as shown in fig.

138 [Feb., peristome is well expanded, continuous, and usually stands shortly free from the whorl in front.
The parietal lamella is sigmoid, bending far to the right at its inner end.
The angular lamella, also sigmoid, runs from the peristome to the parietal lamella, the two lamellae together forming a figure like the letter <*.
The columellar lamella is broad and horizontal far within, but near the aperture it runs out upon the parietal wall, where it appears as a more or less elevated cord between the parietal lamella and the columella, occupying, therefore, the place of an infraparietal lamella.
These lamellae are well shown in fig.
30 b, a basal view in which the base of the shell has been removed.
The upper palatal fold is short, situated some distance within the mouth, but visible from in front.
The lower palatal is long, entering, and so deeply immersed that it is not visible in a front view, being concealed behind the massive parietal barrier.
There is a radially placed basal fold, scarcely or not visible in a front view.

B. ashmuni is distinguished by the strong development of the angulo-parietal lamella, which bends far to the right at its inner end, the very deep immersion of the lower palatal and basal folds, the continuation of the columellar lamella upon the parietal wall, alongside the parietal lamella, and the longer, usually more gibbous, "neck" of the last whorl.

The shell is slightly tapering cylindric, like B. ashmuni, but the last whorl is less protracted and the crest or wave behind the aperture is very low, often not noticeable.
The peristome is continuous as a slightly raised thread across the parietal wall (or in a less developed form it is rather widely interrupted above).
Lamellae weaker than in typical B. ashmuni, especially the angular lamella, which is straighter; parietal lamella less curved at its inner end.
Columellar lamella wide and horizontal, not continued upon the parietal wall.

The absence of a forward continuation of the columellar lamella on the parietal wall, between the parietal lamella and the columellar wall, is the most prominent feature of this species, though it has several other constant, if less conspicuous, differential characters.
It is decidedly less aberrant than B. ashmuni, the lamellae and folds, as well as the less protracted last whorl, approaching the normal Bifidaria type.

The teeth are much weaker, especially the angular lamella.
The inner end of the parietal lamella is not much curved and is readily visible in an obliquely basal view in the aperture.
The basal and palatal folds are less deeply placed, the lower palatal being visible below the apex of the parietal barrier in a front view.
The basal .1910.]
141 fold is very small.
The upper margin of the peristome is adnate for some distance.
In this form, or race, if such it proves to be, B. ashmuni cochisensis makes its nearest approach to B. dalliana and to the following race.
Possibly Dr. Sterki at the time of his original description had cochisensis before him, together with typical ashmuni, since he mentions specimens from the Santa Rita Mountains.
We have examined a lot collected by Mr. Ashmun at that place and find them all to be .cochisensis.
The terms of Sterki's original description apply only to the form herein defined as ashmuni, for he mentions the crest Fig.

— Bifidaria cochisensis P. and F. Santa Rita Mountains, Arizona.
"forming a projecting angle at the base" and the columella!lamella "ascending to the body-whorl between the parietal and columella."
Careful examination of a series of several thousand examples, supplying data for the present account, has shown no intergrading forms between ashmuni and cochisensis, yet careful cleaning of the aperture is necessary for their discrimination.

The parietal barrier is simplified (fig.

In view, therefore, of the very wide separation of the two forms geographically, it may be best to treat them as specifically diverse.

B, B. bilamellata S. and C, type.
B. dalliana is related to B. cochisensis, but differs by being conspicuously more slender, resembling B. p. hordeacella in shape, but it diverges more fundamentally by the parietal lamella, the inner end of which turns slightly toward the columella, while in B. ashmuni, cochisensis and perversa the inner end bends towards the outer wall.
In the Chiricahuas the specimens are often longer than the types, one figured here measuring 2 mm.
long, .85 wide.
Bifidaria bilamellata Sterki and Clapp stands very close to B. dalliana, but it differs by having a perceptibly more tapering spire, which is somewhat longer, and the columellar lamella has a vertical callus at its inner end (weaker or wanting in dalliana).
The parietal lamellae are substantially alike in the two species.
For comparison we reproduce here the type figure of B. bilamellata (fig.

97,757 A. N. S. P., collected by Mr. S. N. Rhoads, Feb. 22, 1905.
Compared with Marinula pepita King this species differs by its much more inflated shape, the more slender spire, more or less attenuate above, the nearly even suture, and the varied coloring.
The face of the columella is flat or concave in M. rhoadsi, and the parietal lamella emerges further, approaching the edge of the parietal callus.
In M. pepita the face of the columella is convex and the parietal, lamella does not emerge so far.
This species is named for Mr. Samuel N. Rhoads, who made a journey, not without difficulty and danger, down the Colorado River below Yuma, returning along the bases of the arid mountains westward to Calexico, California.

BY C. S. SARGENT.
Since the publication in the Proceedings of the Academy for 1905 of my paper on Crataegus in Eastern Pennsylvania a further systematic study of the genus in other parts of the State has been made.
The results of these studies appear in the following paper.
Additional observations have also been made in Delaware.
Chester and Monroe Counties by Mr. B. H. Smith, in Bucks County by Dr. C. D. Fretz, and in Berks County by Mr. C. L. Gruber.
In Lackawanna County, at Scranton and in its neighborhood, where the genus is largely represented in many distinct forms, important collections have been made by Mr. A. Twining.
The region surrounding Orbisonia, in Huntingdon County, has been carefully explored by Mr. B. H. Smith, who has also collected for several seasons near Bedford in Bedford County, near Altoona in Blair County, and at Wilmore and Portage in Cambria County.
Prof. O. E. Jennings has placed at my disposal very large collections accompanied by valuable notes made by him and his wife near Pittsburg, in Allegheny County, and in Washington, Westmoreland and Armstrong Counties.
Without the assistance and careful observations of all these collectors the publication of this paper would have been impossible.
To Mr. Smith I am under special obligations.
He has been my guide and companion during a number of journeys made during the last five years through many of the Crataegus fields of the State; he has enriched his specimens by the most carefully prepared notes and with excellent sketches of the fruit of many species, and he has been a constant and untiring adviser during the preparation of this paper, which has occupied my attention for several years.
The field is by no means exhausted; a large part of the State has never been visited by careful observers of Crataegus, and in the regions where the genus has been the most carefully examined, plants occur which are still imperfectly known ; and before it is possible to prepare a third paper on the Crataegus of the State, collections must be made over large territories, and these collections, it is to be hoped, will not be long delayed.

Mr. Gruber, who has watched carefully during several seasons the trees of these two forms growing near together, is convinced that Cratoegus trahax should be specifically distinguished.
A plant in an old hedge on Island Road, West Philadelphia, B. H. Smith (No.

> Crataegus punctata is one of the most generally and widely distributed species of northeastern North America.
It varies greatly in the size of the leaves, the amount of pubescence on the leaves, corymbs and young branches, and in the size and color of the fruit, which varies from dark red to light yellow and green.
The most distinct of these varieties has vellow anthers and vellow fruit often with a reddish cheek.
This has sometimes been considered a species, but individuals occur on which flowers with rose-colored and with yellow anthers, and with red and yellow fruits, may occasionally be found.
The yellow fruited form is Crataegus punctata var.

Medioxim.e n. gr.
Leaves thick, hairy on the upper surface early in the season, glabrous and usually smooth at maturity; petioles long and slender.
Flowers in few-flowered glabrous corymbs; stamens 10 or less; anthers rose color or rarely pink.
Fruit subglobose to shortoblong, ovate or obovate, generally longer than broad, rarely slightly angled, scarlet, crimson or orange-red, occasionally slightly pruinose, ripening late in September or in October; flesh hard and solid; mature calyx sessile; nutlets 2-5, usually 3 or 4.
In this group I have placed a number of shrubby species which in some important characters appear intermediate between the Pruinosae and the Tenuifoliae.
From the former they differ in their thinner leaves, smaller flowers, always glabrous usually few-flowered corymbs, generally fewer stamens with rose-colored or pink anthers, and especially in the fruit ; this has a sessile calyx, is rarely slightly pruinose, never green at maturity like that of many of the Pruinosae and generally ripens earlier.
From the Tenuifolise the plants of this group differ in their thicker leaves, generally fewer-flowered corymbs, and in their solid not succulent later-ripening fruit.
In addition to the species enumerated in this paper, Crataegus alacris Sarg.
and Crataegus vittata Ashe of eastern Pennsylvania may be placed in this group, as well as many of the well-known species of western New York, Ontario and Michigan which have been grouped with the Pruinosae, like C. opulens Sarg., C. maineana Sarg., C. diffusa Sarg., C. compta Sarg., C. dissona Sarg., and others.

Corrected Characters of the Flowers.
— Leaves less than one-half grown when the flowers open about the 10th of May and then very thin, yellow-green and roughened above by short white hairs.
Flowers 1.5-1.9 cm.
in diameter, on very short slender glabrous pedicels, in small compact 6-12-flowered corymbs, the lower peduncles from the axils of upper leaves ; calyx-tube narrowly obconic, the lobes gradually narrowed from wide bases, long, slender, acuminate, minutely glandular-dentate above the middle or entire, slightly hairy on the inner surface, reflexed after anthesis; stamens 5-10; anthers dark rose color; styles 3 or 4, surrounded at the base by a broad ring of pale tomentum.
Through an error caused by the mixing of specimens of two plants growing close together the flowers of Crataegus felix were originally described as with 18-20 stamens and pale rose-colored anthers, and this species was placed among the Pruinosae.

"^^^c^Hp U&^/C**-*****^^ A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF HENRY CADWALADER CHAPMAN, M.D., Sc.D.
BY EDWARD J. NOLAN, M.D.
Visitors to the library of the Academy in 1868 were likely to encounter a little old man, dressed in gray.
If it were a morning in winter he would be found reading the Ledger near the register before going on with the drawing of fossil shells on stone for the American Journal of Conchology.
He was an enthusiast in his specialty of fossil shells and his work will endure.
His health was far from good, and he was wont to say that the compensations the years brought him were the recurring "songs of the birds and the perfume of new mown hay."
It is evident, therefore, that he was a poet as well as a geologist.
His exceedingly frugal lunch would sometimes be eaten at his work table, but he frequently carried his provisions, often a few shellbarks and a pinch of red pepper, in a little basket on his arm to the Pennsylvania Hospital, where his brother was then apothecary.
Here he met the young Chapman for whom he conceived a warm regard, heartily reciprocated, the friendship remaining unbroken until the death of the older man in 1877.
It was a striking case of the attraction of opposite:?, their only traits in common being a love of Nature and an eager desire to explore her mysteries.
Chapman was strongly influenced by the enthusiasm of the older naturalist.
He declared, half seriously, in after years, "he is responsible for all the time I have wasted in the study of natural history."
If that be true, Timothy Abbott Conrad is also indirectly responsible for the preparation of this notice, but it cannot be doubted that an important factor in determining Chapman's career, apart from his inherited bent for scientific investigation, was his devotion to Leidy.
Henry Cadwalader Chapman was born in Philadelphia in the house of his grandmother, Mrs. John Markoe, 1617 Walnut Street, 17 August 17, 1845.
He was the son of George W. Chapman, a lieutenant in the United States Navy, and grandson of Dr. Nathaniel Chapman, who, coming from Virginia in the autumn of 1797, had married Miss Rebecca Biddle, a daughter of Colonel Clement Biddle, Commissary General of the Continental Army.
In 1813 Dr. Chapman became associated with the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania, with which he was connected continuously until 1853, as Professor of Materia Medica, the Theory and Practice of Medicine, and of Clinical Medicine.
Henry's mother was Miss Emily Markoe, the daughter of John Markoe, and granddaughter of Abraham Markoe, the first Captain of the Philadelphia City Troop.
She and her family were remarkable for their wit and humor, and her son amply inherited both.
His character in early life, and indeed up to the last, was somewhat of a contradiction.
While thoroughly enjoying the diversions so liberally supplied by his social position, he early manifested an interest in chemistry and physics.
His genial and joyous nature made him one of the most attractive of boys, and as a young man his society was sought by many older than himself.
These attractive qualities persisted, with no sign of diminution, throughout his mature years.
His early education was received at the Faires Classical Institute, then located at No.
238 Dean Street, now officially Camac Street, but coming to be known popularly as Club Alley.
The Institute was at the time the most exclusive, as well as one of the best, schools in Philadelphia.
The Rev.
John W. Faires, Principal of the Institute, became an instructor of boys in 1831, his first pupils being William Cadwalader, later a member of the Academy, and his cousin J. Williams Biddle.
During a period of more than fifty years Dr. Faires had a successful career as a teacher, his alumni including many of the most distinguished men of the city and state.
He was a strict disciplinarian and he held unflinchingly to the doctrine that to spare the rod was to spoil the child.
The daily floggings which took place in the presence of the higher classes, and of which Hemy Chapman, because of his love of fun and impatience of discipline, received his full share as the penalty of his larks, would be regarded now, when the independence of "the little child" is held to be the paramount interest of society, as not far short of brutal.
The master had a collection of rattans in his desk adapted to the size and age of the culprits, and as he made his selection for the particular one in hand and bent it to test its elasticity, the boy enjoyed a few moments of anticipation of what was coming to him.
The punishment was, however, rarely or never resented, the master's sense of justice and his desire to make boys truthful and honest being fully recognized.
While fighting and disorderly behavior, even at recess, were forbidden, the Doctor realized that the best way for the boys to settle some of their differences was for one or the other to secure a black eye or a bloody nose, before he descended in his wrath to stop the combat.
The students of the school at the period referred to were the best prepared of those applying for admission to the University, to Princeton, or to other colleges, and for a time the first honor man in every class in the University was a Faires Boy.
If the school could be said to have a specialty it was careful instruction in Latin and Greek.
These were the influences under which Chapman was prepared for the Department of Arts of the University of Pennsylvania.
Those who knew him in after years will readily believe that Dr. Faires was sincere when he declared that he had never had a more brilliant scholar on the roll of the school.
The originality and mental acuteness of the boy were early apparent.
He was, however, far from being a diligent or attentive student, his tendency to regard the world from a humorous point of view leading him into the difficulties encountered by all such youths.
They are nearly always loved, although sometimes dreaded, by the teacher.
The classes in the College, or the Department of Arts of the University of Pennsylvania, which he entered in 1860 from this preparatory school, occupied the upper of the two buildings on 9th Street between Chestnut and Market Streets, the site of the mansion built in 1800 as the residence of the Presidents of the United States.
The faculty was small, as was also the attendance, which was quite local as compared with the present cosmopolitan enrollment in West Philadelphia.
The men who filled the Chairs, however, were of tne first rank in their specialties and it was a great advantage to the student to come into direct relation with the professors themselves, there being at that time no assistants or tutors.
Henry Vethake, John F. Frazer, George Allen, Henry Coppee and Provost Goodwin, with the remarkable mathematician, E. Otis Kendall, were the equals, and in many respects the superiors, of the teachers in other institutions.
The students all lived in their own homes.
The system of instruction practiced in the school was well adapted to produce educated, efficient and honorable men, provided with the requirements of active life as well as with the accomplishments of the scholar.
Social grades were sharply marked, much more so than at piesent.
The members of the college fraternities were thrown into the closest intimacy, and life-long friendships were formed through them.
Chapman belonged to the Delta Phi, first established in the University in 1849.
He never cared greatly about athletics, which occupied no such prominent place in University interests as they do now.
Cricket was the game of the period, but Chapman never went in for it.
He may have gone on the river, but he was not one of the College crew.
1 Henry graduated from the Department of Arts in 1864.
He almost immediately crossed the campus and matriculated in the Medical Department, by far the most distinguished medical school in America, under the preceptorship of Dr. Addinell Hewson.
Here also the teaching force was small, consisting of but seven professors : Joseph Leidy, Joseph Carson, R. A. F. Penrose, Henry H. Smith, Robert E. Rogers, Alfred Stille and Francis Gurney Smith, but these were the worthy successors of the men who had brought the school to its distinguished position and they more than maintained its brilliant record.
As in school and college, Chapman sustained the easiest relations to the medical curriculum, frequently missing lectures but always, after a few hours' reading, acquitting himself at quiz as well as the most studious of his classmates.
He took his degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1867, the subject of his thesis being Generation.
He entered the Pennsylvania Hospital the same year, first as an attache of the apothecary shop and later as a resident physician, 1 I am much indebted to Mr. John Cadwalader for these recollections of the young Chapman, of the Faires school, and of the College before the removal to West Philadelphia.
In his reminiscences of the school Mr. Cadwalader tells one story which is now of more than local interest.
"A big, well built boy of about fifteen years of age, named Irvine Stephens Bulloch, was then in the second class.
It was unusual for the Doctor to flog a boy of this size, as he realized it imposed too severe a humiliation on him.
Bulloch was usually a good student, but he sat behind a very offensive boy whom he felt it his duty to constantly chastise.
This he did by giving him, from time to time, a loud smack in the face which could be heard throughout the school.
The victim, quite as big as Bulloch, would set up a howl without attempting to resent the blow.
The sympathies of the school were, as a matter of course, all witli the aggressor.
Dr. Faires had a warm regard for Bulloch, who was a boy after his own heart, but he had told him repeatedly his assaults must stop.
Catching him one day in the act the Doctor became much enraged, as he sometimes would on due provocation.
Seizing his heaviest cane he ran across the room.
Bulloch escaped to another aisle, the boys guarding his retreat as effectively as possible until he reached the door, when, raising his hand, he cried: 'Dr.
Faires, you cannot flog me and I do not want to fight with you.
I know, of course, I will have to leave the school; so, good bye, fellows, I am awfully sorry to go.'
This boy, who had come from Georgia, was the uncle of Theodore Roosevelt.
He entered the Confederate Navy, was a distinguished officer, and was on the 'Alabama' in its battle with the 'Kearsage.'
A portrait of him was published in the Illustrated London News soon after the battle."
which position he retained until 1869, when he went to Europe for a three years' course of study under Sir Richard Owen in London, Alphonse Milne Edward in Paris, Emile DuBois Reymond in Berlin, and Joseph Hyrtl in Vienna.
His beloved friends Leidy and Conrad being his sponsors, he had been elected a member of the Academy in 1868.
For Dr. Leidy, especially, he entertained the most affectionate regard and he never lost an opportunity of acknowledging with impulsive generosity his indebtedness to the great naturalist for inspiration and encouragement.
His championship of his friend, who never answered criticisms or decried injustice, was amusingly illustrated by a note to the American Naturalist in which he calls attention to the fact that Wyville Thomson, in his remarks on sponges, had neglected to state that Leidy was first to correctly describe the natural position of Hyaloncma, Euplectella and Pleuronema, concluding with the remark: "We trust that Prof. Thomson will now gracefully throw up the sponge."
Immediately on his return from Europe he applied himself to the problems of evolution, in which he was deeply interested.
The result of his reading, for the most part in the library of the Academy, was the publication of his first work, a volume of 193 pages entitled The Evolution of Life.
It was issued from the press September 17, 1872, although the title page is dated the following year.
So assiduously had he devoted himself to the preparation of the work that his health broke down and he was compelled to go abroad immediately after placing the manuscript in the hands of his publishers, the preface being prepared in Paris.
The proofs were corrected and the index prepared by the Librarian of the Academy to whom he had entrusted the pleasant duty of seeing the book through the press.
The introduction is an interesting resume of the history of the doctrine of evolution.
He acknowledges his special indebtedness to Prof. Hyrtl, Dr. Friedlowsky, Dr. Klein of Vienna, Prof. Owen, Mr.
Flower of London, Prof. Gervais of Paris, and to his friends Drs.
Leidy and James Aitkin Meigs, for encouragement and advice during the progress of the work.
Although the book gives evidence of extensive reading, it is believed that Dr. Chapman regretted later that he had not waited until his judgment was more mature.
The work, in common with nearly everything published by the author subsequently, was written literally currente calamo and showed evidences of impatience of the restraints of composition, punctuation, especially, being regarded as an impertinent artificial device, which might for the time be safely ignored.
His attention having been once called by the Editor of the Proceedings, to the absence of punctuation marks in his manuscripts, he replied, "Well!
I will write a lot of commas, colons and semi-colons and you may scatter them about as you please."
2 Some revision of diction and careful proof-reading were always, in fact, necessary in connection with Chapman's literary work, not from mere carelessness, and still less, it is scarcely necessary to say, from incapacity, but because of a controlling desire to be rid of what was in hand as promptly as possible so as to be free to go on with some other task which had, in the meantime, established itself as of dominant interest.
Dr. Chapman's first contribution to the Proceedings of the Academy ,was a report of remarks made at the meeting of 1873 on a species of Delphinus.
At the meeting of November 25 of the same year he acknowledges his indebtedness to the Directors of the Zoological Garden for the opportunity of dissecting a specimen of the Musanga, the results of which he communicates verbally.
Then in the third annual report of the Zoological Society of Philadelphia, it is stated that he had made dissections valuable to the comparative anatomist and pathologist and that as a result thereof papers on certain muscles in Ateles geoffroyi and Mucacus rheus and on the bloodvessels in the rete mirabile of Bradypus didactylus had been published in the Proceedings of the Academy.
Subsequently his work as Prosector of the Society, to which position he had been elected in 1874, supplied him with material for contributions to the Proceedings on the omentum of the Dog-faced Monkey, on the anatomy of the Giraffe, the Elephant, the Manatee, the Capybara, the Chimpanzee, the Amphiuma, the Macacus, the Ourang Outang, the Kangaroo, the Echidna, the Hyaena, the Cryptobranchus, the Gibbon, the Chiromys, and the Armadillo.
Some of these articles were original contributions to science while others were corroborations or corrections of the results obtained by earlier anatomists.
They frequently give evidence of familiarity with the classics as well as with modern bibliography.
In a detailed report to the Zoological Society in 1876 he endorses 2 Dr. Chapman probably never heard of Lord Timothy Dexter, who, at the conclusion of his unpunctuated A Pickle for the Knowing Ones or Plain Truths in a Homespun Dress, supplies half a page of assorted marks with the note: ".
.
.
.
the Nowing ones complane of my book the fust edition had no stops I put in A nuf here and they may peper and salt it as they plese."
the position of the managers of other Zoological Gardens that drugs are of but small avail in treating the ailments of lower animals and records it as his experience as Prosector that the principal causes of deaths during the first six months of the existence of the Garden were improper food, badly regulated temperature and ill constructed cages.
He attributes the greatly improved conditions to the effects of common sense hygienic treatment, the result of careful attention and watchfulness on the part of those having charge of the animals.
He then enumerates the causes of death of 74 of the 113 animals lost during the year, intimating that the others were old and in poor condition when received and that they had gradually wasted away, this being more especially the case with the birds.
It is evident that he took a deep interest in the condition of the Garden and that he was not sparing of labor to advance its prosperity.
He became a Director of the Society April 28, 1881, served as Secretary in 1884 and as Corresponding Secretary from Nov. 24, 1890 to Nov. 10, 1904.
From other sources he obtained the material for his elaborate studies of the Gorilla, the Hippopotamus, the Galeopithecus and the Hyrax.
As a contribution to the eighth volume of the quarto Journal of the Academy, he published in 1881 his account of the placenta and generative apparatus of an elephant belonging to Cooper and Bailey's London Circus, then occupying winter quarters at 23d Street and Ridge Avenue in this city.
A young female had been born at 2.30 A.M., March 9, 1880.
The period of gestation was fixed at from 650 to 655 days, another corroboration by modern research of the statements of that accurate observer, Aristotle.
This was the first circumstantial account of the pregnancy and delivery of an elephant and the article excited wide interest.
It is, with the article on the placentation of the Kangaroo, published in the Proceedings of the Academy for 1881, the author's most important contribution to original research.
3 3 "The observations of Prof. Chapman of America show that these bags [the yolk sacs and allantois] are all present in the Kangaroo, but that they are all small and arrested."
W. Kitchen Parker On Mammalian Descent, p. 61.
Referring again to Dr. Chapman's paper "On the Embryo of the Kangaroo," and to one by Dr. Osborn on the same subject, Prof. Parker remarks: "The two papers just mentioned might, literally, be folded up and packed inside a nut-shell; and yet, if I am not greatly mistaken, they let in more light upon the incoming of both the Metatheria and the Eutheria than anything that has gone before. "
Of course, only the biological reader of such communications can value them properly, as he only can thoroughly understand their meaning and their bearing; and yet the patient and thoughtful general reader may come at the gist of the matter."
Parker, op.
cit.
p. 83.
He accompanied Leidy, Willcox, and Porter to the West in 1872, and had an opportunity of observing the work of naturalists in the field.
He served as Dr. Leidy's assistant in the University from 1873 to 1876, and lectured there on anatomy and physiology.
The position of Coroner's Physician was held by him under Dr. Kingston Goddard and Dr. William Kent Gilbert from 1874 to 1880.
Dr. Chapman was married to Hannah Naglee Megargee, daughter of Samuel Megargee, December 2, 1876.
The union, characterized by a community of social interests, was a most happy one.
The Treatise on Human Physiology is affectionately dedicated by the author to his wife "as a small acknowledgment of the interest evinced and encouragement extended in its completion."
Their summers were spent in Bar Harbor where, in 1886, the house was purchased which they named Mira Monte, and in which Dr. Chapman died.
Here for nearly thirty years he pursued his studies of the flora and fauna of Mt.
Desert island, the latter in a little laboratory on the water's edge.
Here the fishermen, all his devoted friends, brought whatever of interest they succeeded in securing from the waters.
The material progress of his summer home and the welfare of its citizens, among whom he was universally popular, were to him matters of active concern.
He endeavored in every way in his power to minimize the distinctions between the summer colony and the permanent residents.
He took an active interest in the local library which he served as a Director.
He succeeded George W. Tryon, Jr., as a Curator of the Academy, August 8, 1876.
He held the office only until the end of the following year.
He was elected a member of the Council in 1880, but finding, after the lapse of four months, that his other engagements interfered with the discharge of his duties, he resigned.
Again elected a Curator in 1891, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Dr. Leidy, he acted as Chairman of the Board until the close of 1904, when he declined a renomination.
During his term of office he cooperated earnestly with his associates in the establishment of desirable administrative reforms.
Having served as Demonstrator of Physiology in association with Dr. James Aitken Meigs in the Jefferson Medical College for the sessions of 1877 to 1880, he lectured on experimental physiology in the summer course of 1878 and was Curator of the Museum in 1879-80.
He was given a second degree of Doctor of Medicine by the College in 1878, his thesis being on Persistence of Forces in Biology.
Dr. Meigs died November 9, 1879, shortly after beginning his course of lectures for that term.
At the request of the Board of Trustees it was continued and completed by Dr. Chapman.
So acceptably was the engagement fulfilled that he was appointed by the Board to the vacant chair of Institutes of Medicine and Medical Jurisprudence in the spring of the following year.
He secured from Paris as promptly as he could a collection of the most recent apparatus for physiological investigation.
It was with the assistance of portions of this collection — Regnault and Reisert's instruments for the study of respiration and Helmolz's Ophthalmometer — that his fine papers on respiration and on the radius of the curve of the cornea were prepared, together with those on the general physiology of nerves and muscles, in conjunction with his assistant and successor in the chair, Dr. Albert P. Brubaker.
His introductory lecture to his first year's course was published by the Class.
Considering the scope and purpose of physiology he dwells on the advantages of a study of pathology and insists on the importance of comparative anatomy, illustrating his position by reference to the action of the pancreatic juice in the beaver and the rabbit, the relation of the size of the brain to mental development in the lower animals, and to the nature of the bile as studied in Doris, one of the nudibranchiate mollusks.
The limitations of the usefulness of vivisection in the prosecution of physiological research is frankly acknowledged, but the practical results secured up to that time were recounted and the opinion was expressed that, if vivisection should be banished from the laboratory, the physiologist would be deprived of one of his most fertile methods of research.
Dr. Chapman addressed the graduating class of the College in the Academy of Music, March 30, 1882, and again on April 2, 1890.
On the latter occasion he advises the graduates to get married as soon as they can and dwells on the advantages to the young practitioner of the conjugal partnership.
He considers the results of inductive and deductive reasoning, claims that the latter is essentially the feminine mode and assures his young hearers that matrimony will strengthen their inductive masculine minds.
He filled the chair in Jefferson College until the completion of last year's course when he resigned, with the intention of devoting his entire time to original research.
His resignation was accepted with regret and he was made Emeritus Professor.
His skill in adapting his physiological teaching to the practical needs of the physician was fully recognized by his students and associates in the Faculty.
During the years of his connection with the College he never hesitated to express with characteristic frankness and force his views on questions relating to the conduct of the school.
The feeling entertained for him by his students was one of personal affection.
A memoir of his predecessor, prepared for the College of Physicians, was published in the Transactions and is a well-expressed appreciation of the work of Dr. Meigs as a teacher and of the value of his contributions to anthropological science.
While acting as demonstrator to Dr. Meigs, he was elected in 1878 to the Professorship of Physiology in the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery.
He retained the position until 18S5, when, desirous of giving undivided attention to his educational work in Jefferson College, he resigned.
Here, as elsewhere, the force and originality of his teaching secured the attention and interest of his class, and his resignation was regarded as inflicting a loss on the institution.
Europe was again visited in 1882 and 1887.
During a stay in Paris in 1899, he was presented to the Academy of Sciences and he made a communication before the Society of Biology on the placentation of the elephant.
An abstract of his remarks was published in the Comptes Rendus of the Society, where also appeared, in 1903, some notes on the placentation of mammals in general.
His attention while in Paris was by no means confined to scientific interests, the vast storehouses of literature and art so liberally administered there for the benefit of the public receiving a full share of his attention.
He visits the Bibliotheque Nationale to look at one of the two complete copies in existence of the Christ ianismi Restitutio of Michael Servetus.
It is easy to believe that he was more attracted by the rarity of the volume than by its contents.
He is also shown Charlemagne's Bible and those of most of the kings of France; the memoirs of Louis XI Y, written by himself in the intervals of his intrigues; the Bible of Catherine de Medicis bound at a cost of 60,000 francs ; the great Mazarin Bible; the autographs of Montaigne, Rabelais, Moliere (the only one in existence); the first books of travel printed; lots of Caxtons, letters of Columbus, Vespucci, Cortez, Pizarro, and hundreds of other treasures in which he revels.
He spent another pleasant day at the Observatory with Simon Newcomb, when, because of the presence of the distinguished American astronomer, the resources of the establishment were courteously displayed.
The History of the Discovery of the Circulation of the Blood was published in 1884.
The essay was given as a lecture in Jefferson College the year before.
It makes a small volume of fifty-six pages, but it is, from a literary point of view, the author's most satisfactory work, showing erudition, thoroughness of research and clearness of statement.
It forms, without much change, the 25th Chapter of the Treatise on Human Physiology, published in 1887, a second edition appearing in 1899.
A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology, designed, apparently, merely as an aid to the student in following the lectures, was published in 1892, subsequent editions appearing in 1896 and 1903.
He prepared an appreciative memoir of Dr. Joseph Leidy for the Academy in 1891.
It is an adequate record of the work of his friend, to the value of whose encouragement and guidance he was always delighted to testify.
Dr. Leidy's claims to public gratitude were again presented by him in an address delivered in the City Hall on the occasion of the dedication of Murray's statue of the great naturalist, October 30, 1907.
His paper on The Interpretation of Certain Verses of the First Chapter of Genesis in the Light of Paleontology was contributed to the Proceedings of the Academy in 1893.
The article must be considered as a mere tour de force.
It is not regarded as a contribution to our knowledge of the subject by either Biblical or Hebrew scholars, and is mainly interesting as illustrative of the range and diversity of Dr. Chapman's interests.
He was elected a member of the Board of Directors of the Library Company of Philadelphia, April 3, 1902.
He took an active interest in the affairs of the Company, serving on the Book and Ridgway Branch Committees.
Again in Europe in 1902, he gave special attention to the collections in Florence under the guidance of Giglioli, the Director of the Museum, and to those of the Zoological Station of Naples, where he was cordially received by the late Prof. Dohrn, who assisted him in procuring for the Academy a fine collection of the invertebrates of the Bay of Naples.
The specimens, prepared with the care characteristic of the Station, filled no less than 152 glass jars, and constitute a most valuable addition to the Museum, which had been enriched from time to time by the anatomical material of Dr. Chapman's studies, and by interesting collections from Bar Harbor.
A few months were spent in Paris in 1903, when he again addressed the Biological Society.
He was back in Bar Harbor by the first of July.
In 1905 he visited Egypt where he applied himself with characteristic energy to the study of hieroglyphics and Egyptian antiquities.
He subsequently went to Rome and became intensely interested in the excavations of the Roman Forum.
His devotion to this field of research continued unabated and he looked forward with eagerness to pursuing his studies in the Eternal City when the resignation of his professorship would leave him in complete control of his time.
He was much gratified by the reception in June, 1908, of the degree of Doctor of Science from his Alma Mater in recognition of the value of his contributions to original research.
Elected a Fellow of the College of Physicians in 1 880 he served on the Library Committee from January, 1891, to June, 1892.
He was a member of the American Philosophical Society, the American Physiological Society, and the Franklin Institute; but he devoted much more time to the Academy and the Zoological Society than to the other institutions with which he was connected.
His last visit to the Academy was made a week before his departure for Bar Harbor.
He was then in his usual exuberant spirits, with but little appearance of impaired health.
Shortly after his arrival at his summer home he complained of severe pain, which was supposed to be intercostal neuralgia, but which, in connection with some difficulty in swallowing, was doubtless symptomatic of grave digestive disturbance.
He was, however, able to attend to his many social duties, and to keep up his interest in the work of his laboratory until September 6th, when he was taken with a severe hemorrhage from the stomach, probably the effect of a gastric ulcer.
A copious repetition of the flow of blood the following day resulted in his death.
Mrs. Chapman survives him, childless.
The funeral exerciser were held at Bar Harbor in St. Saviour's Church on the 10th of September.
The body was brought to Philadelphia and buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in the presence of a few relatives and intimate friends who had assembled at his residence, No.
2047 Walnut Street, a few blocks from where he was born.
The qualities which endeared Dr. Chapman to his schoolmates persisted throughout his life.
He remained to the end a boy, with a cultivated mind, an unquenchable desire for the acquisition of knowledge, an intense enjoyment of life, and an unvarying self-possession, the result of success, appreciation, and inheritance.
His sense of humor, his mental acuteness, his generosity, his sympathy with all human endeavor, his possession of what his friend Weir Mitchell finely calls "a boundless charity of attention," secured for him the affectionate regard of many with whom he could not be supposed to have much community of interest.
In most intellectual centres, and characterizing almost every generation, certain men become famous as the authors of well told stories, sparkling witticisms and apt repartee.
They are frequently credited by tradition with much more of that sort of achievement than they were really responsible for.
In this connection President Lincoln, Emory Storrs, William B. Travers, Sam Ward and Paul B. Goddard will be recalled as worthy successors of Tom Hood, Charles Lamb, Sydney Smith and other historic humorists.
In this class Nathaniel Chapman was given a place by his own generation and his fame endures to the present day, not only as an excellent teacher, but also as a man of great personal charm, an exuberant vitality, and an acute sense of humor.
These qualities, transmitted to the son, were inherited in full measure by the grandson, coming, indeed, from both father and mother.
It would not be hard to quote Dr. Chapman as the author of many a dr 11 story and many a witty saying, always to the point and without malice.
These would, without doubt, add greatly to the interest of this essay, but they would manifestly be out of place on the present occasion as being irrelevant.
One of his Bar Harbor friends tells of his having once dissected an oyster in his laboratory, several distinguished men of science being interested spectators.
Without looking up, or interrupting the manipulation of his scalpel for an instant, he told a story which was greeted with roars of laughter.
This was an experience quite familiar to those associated with Dr. Chapman in his most serious scientific work, the character of which was not, however, damaged by his joyous interludes.
It must be fresh in the recollection of many Academicians how the old library hall would ring with hilarity on the occasions of his frequent visits.
Nothing that was human was foreign to him ; he was on good terms with all types of mankind except the Bore and the Sham.
He would, not unlikely, eat an abstemious lunch with Madame Bubble, but he would certainly not devote a minute to the young woman whose name was Dull.
He might exchange opinions, if time permitted, with Mr. Worldliwise, but he would frankly tell Mr. Facingbothways how he regarded him, without thinking it worth while to wait for an answer.
As has been said of another, "it was his good fortune to be a man of the world without being frivolous, and a man of science, without being pedantic."
Although Dr. Chapman's mental equipment was entirely devoid of any recognition of authority except that which appealed to his reason within the bounds of what he himself recognized as its limitations, he was unalterably attached to the traditions and routine which had, actively or passively, moulded his character, and he was as intolerant as a Covenanter when his prejudices were combatted.
In his reply to Dr. Horatio C. Wood's paper on medical education, published at the beginning of the movement which has been productive of such good results in the elevation of the medical profession, he quotes approvingly Huxley's statement concerning the men who had gone up for examination in the University of London, that he had been struck with "the singular unreality of their knowledge of physiology."
He deprecates Dr. Wood's laudation of the courses of instruction in Europe as contrasted with our own: "To establish in this country a University of the German kind, we would first require to have their gymnasia, then their primary schools, then more taxation to support them, a national priesthood to regulate the ideas of the faculty, and finally a standing army to keep the dissatisfied quiet.
A medical education is a good thing, but the privilege of saying what we please, doing what we like, and spending our money as suits us best, is better.
If any American physician will give his lifetime to the study of a specialty, and will lecture on that, and that alone, I have no doubt he can make, like the German professor, a reputation and a living — if he chooses to live like one."
Years after, in considering the proposed act of the Legislature regulating the practice of medicine and surgery, he gives his reasons for believing that such an attempt would be rather to lower than to elevate the standard of medical education in the Commonwealth.
Such opinions were expressed with a vigor and point which, while they might fail to convince, certainly relieved his printed arguments from dulness.
Possessed of a wonderfully retentive memory he was always able to illustrate his point of view and enforce his arguments by apt references and quotations characterized by incisiveness and force.
While ardently devoted to scientific investigation, he was attentive to his many social obligations; but if either had to be held in abeyance, his work had always the precedence, a fact amply demonstrated by the varied and extensive results of his industry, as recorded in the accompanying bibliography.
The value of his contributions to science was recognized on his retirement by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
It is fitting that Dr. Chapman should be remembered as a devoted student of science who contributed liberally to the resources of the Academy and was always active in advancing its interests at home and abroad.
He will dwell in the regard of his fellow members as a genial associate, an intellectual stimulus, and a loyal friend.

J. Cheston Morris, M. D., in the Chair.
Forty-seven persons present.
The Publication Committee reported the reception of papers under the following titles : "Stauroneis terryi D. B. Ward/' by T. Chalkley Palmer (April 11, 1910).
"A revision of the North American Species of the Genus Ischnoptera (Orthoptera)," by James A. G. Rehn and Morgan Hebard (April 12, 1910).
"A new Diatom/' by T. Chalkley Palmer (April 19, 1910).
Under the auspices of the Biological and Microscopical Section the following communications were made: Jelly-pores in the Diatomacece.
— Mr. Charles S. Boyer discussed the observations of Otto Miiller, George Karsten and others upon the occurrence and function of the jelly pore in the Diatomacese and described it as found in certain species not heretofore recorded.
As has been stated, the production of a stipe or jelly cushion appears to be its function.
A more minute study of the habitat in various motile and immotile species is requisite.
The speaker dwelt upon the varying conditions in earlier and later cell growth, of the tube and thallus forming jelly, and of the relation between the raphe and the pore.
Suggestions were made as to the relation between the forms producing the stipes and jelly cushions and those in which the protective devices of many pelagic species were found to be siliceous.
Drawings, original, and from various authors, illustrated the remarks.

Unusual Forms of Myxomycetes.
— Mr. Hugo Bilgram remarked that in the early stages of their existence Myxomycetes are composed of a slimy mass consisting of cells resembling amcebse, and only in the last hours of their life do they assume the apparently organized form of the well-known beautiful sporangia.
The most simple species consist of a mass of spores enclosed in a sporangium wall.
Others develop within the sporangium a capillitium often consisting of branching filaments, and in some genera, of isolated fibres.
In many genera the capillitium bears characteristic markings, such as spines, warts or spiral ribs.
In the process of maturation 18 many species develop within the yet soft sporangium a stipe on which they creep up, so that the matured sporangium is stipitate, and when the stipe has a continuation within the sporangium, this is known as a columella.
The different species have more or less constant characters.
Many are never found stipitate.
Among the stipitate forms it often happens that a few of the sporangia of a gathering are sessile, especially sporangia maturing on the outside of the group.
Two rather extraordinary gatherings were shown under microscopes.
The one was Physarum pulcherrimum, which is usually stipitate, sessile sporangia being rarely seen; but in the specimens shown all sporangia were sessile.
The other exhibit was a specimen of Perichcena chrysospora.
Not a single species of this genera is known to be stipitate, but in the gathering exhibited a number of the sporangia had a well-developed stipe, while others were normal and therefore sessile.
