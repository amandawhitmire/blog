DESCRIPTIONS OF THREE NEW RODENTS FROM THE OLYMPIC MOUNTAINS, WASHINGTON.
BY C HART MERRIAM.
Owing to an unavoidable delay in the publication of my report on the Olympic Mountains, it seems desirable that the following new species of mammals should be recorded as early as practicable.
Arctomys olympus sp.
now Type.
— From Timberline at head of Soled uc River, Olympic Mountains, Washington.
No.
90,518, S ad.
U. S. Nat.
Mus.
Biological Survey Coll.
Collected August 27, 1897, by C. Hart Merriam and Vernon Bailey.
Original No.
6,210.
Characters— Size and general characters as in A. caligatus, from which it differs markedly in color, the feet being brown instead of black, and upper parts in summer pelage uniform dull ochraceous yellow, without the hoary shoulders and fore back, dark posterior back, or the blackish top of head of that species.
Color.
— Entire upper parts except ears and nose, dull buffy or ochraceous yellowish, becoming brown on underparts ; ears and feet brown ; chin and nose white, with a dark bar across face between nose and eyes.
This face bar is probably absent in full summer pelage, and indicates the beginning of the fall change to blackish pelage.
Measurements.
— Type specimen, $ ad., measured in flesh : Total length, 750 mm.
; tail vertebra?, 210 mm.
; hind foot, 110 mm.
Eutamias caurinus sp.
nov.
Type.
— From Timberline near head of Soleduc River, Olympic Mountains, Washington.
No.
90,636, $ ad.
U. S. Nat.
Mus.
Biological Survey Coll.
Collected August 27, 1897, by C Hart Merriam.
Original No.
6,211.
Characters.
— (Type specimen in post breeding pelage — molt not completed posteriorly).
Similar to Eamcenus, but hind feet longer; underside of tail with black border broader, and median chestnutfulvous band darkened by mixture of black hairs ; post-auricular patches obsolete ; face stripes duller ; back of neck not grayish or hoary, but grizzled with fulvous, like shoulders ; middle pair of pale dorsal stripes less sharply defined anteriorly and everywhere mixed with fulvous hairs.
Measurements.
— Type specimen measured in flesh : Total length, 210 mm.
; tail vertebra?, 85 mm.
; hind foot, 34 mm.
Microtus macrurus sp.
nov.
Type.
— From Lake Cushman, Olympic Mountains, Washington.
No.
66,151 9 ad., U. S. Nat.
Mus.
Biological Survey Coll.
Collected June 26, 1894, by Clark P. Streator.
Original number 3,975.
Characters.
— Similar to M mordax but larger, with longer tail and decidedly larger hind feet ; color darker.
Color.
— Upper parts brownish bister with a grizzled ' pepper and salt ' appearance, suggesting M. austerus ; under parts whitish, the plumbeous under-fur showing through ; tail bicolor, dusky above, whitish below, the tip sometimes white, sometimes dusky all round.
In summer pelage the back is browner and the under parts are washed with buffy.
Cranial characters.
— Skull similar to that of M. mordax, but slightly larger, with rostrum and nasals slightly broader.
Measurements.
— Type specimen : Total length, 220 mm.
; tail vertebrae, 88 mm.
; hind foot, 24 mm.
Average of 5 specimens from Olympic Mountains: Total length, 204 mm.
; tail vertebras, 80; hind foot 24-3, Average of 5 specimens of M. mordax from Saw Tooth Lake, Idaho : Total length, 182 mm.
; tail vertebras, 66'5 ; hind foot, 22.
Remarks.
— In coloration Microtus macrurus agrees closely with M. longicaudus from the Black Hills of South Dakota, but in size and proportions it differs from longicaudus even more than from mordax.
All three of these animals are very closely related, and it would not be far amiss if both mordax and macrurus were placed as subspecies of longicaudus.
