A STUDY OF THE SYSTEMATIC AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE DECAPOD FAMILY CRANGONIDJE BATE.
BY ARNOLD E. CtftTMANN.
In a former paper 1 I gave in general terms the limits of the IndoPacific literal region, to which I added a study of the origin of the recent literal regions of the world.
As these considerations, founded upon the geographical distribution of the Decapoda, contain but a few detailed investigations, it is necessary to go more into detail when a separate group of Decapoda is examined and to state the relations to the principles given in the paper quoted.
In 1891 I revised the genera Palaemon and Bithyms 2 and gave an account of their geographical distribution.
In 1894 I published an account of the family Atyidre!
3 These groups of fresh water Crustacea are wholly unlike each other in respect to their geographical range and agree only in that they are true tropical animals.
Whilst the Palcemon and Bithynis group of the Palsemonida; is a very recent one, related in its distribution, without doubt, to the limits of the recent marine literal regions, the family Atyida?
is comparatively an ancient one, showing in no way relations to the former.
In the present paper I will treat of a true marine group, the family of Crangonidse, which is characterized by the adaptation of most of its members to the cold waters of the Arctic and deep sea regions.
Fossil remains of Crangonid?e are unknown.
In all species referred with more or less doubt to this family, the typical characters are not evident.
The absence of Crangonidoe from the Tertiary deposits agrees with their morphological characters and their supposed recent development.
They form the most extreme end of one of the two main branches of the Eucyphidea.
4 The principal character is the more or less reduced condition of the second pair of pereiopoda.

Crangonidse are connected with the Nikichc by the genus Glyphocrangon, but this connection is not a close one — there are some gaps.
Among the Crangonidse, the genus Pontocaris is no doubt the most primitive in regard to the sculpture of the carapace; the number of gills and the shape of the second pair of pereiopoda.
From P<»itocaris arise two divergent branches: the one through the subgenus Sclerocmngon to Crangon, ending in Nectocrangon, characterized by no shortening of the second pair of pereiopoda, by the reduction of the number of gills, and by the surface of the body becoming gradually smoother.
The other branch is represented by the genera Pontophilus, Sabinea, Paracrangon, characterized by the reduction of the second pair of pereiopoda in length, by retaining the primitive number of gills and the sculpture of the body.
In Pontophilus some species have the body more or less smooth.
The genus Prionocrangon is an aberrant one, without eyes, but related probably to the genera Pontophilus and Sabinea of the second branch.

The branchial formula given by Bate (1. c, p. 482) wrong.
is certainly G. O. Sars creates for some species the genus Sclerocrangon.
I can not adopt this genus, but I retain it as a subgenus.

8 Description: Carapace with three keels, the median one with four long spines, the first longest and placed on the upper margin of rostrum, which extends a little beyond the eyes; the second spine nearly as long as the first, placed immediately behind the base of the rostrum.
The spines are directed obliquely forward and upward.
Lateral keels formed by four spines, the foremost, on the anterior margin of carapace near the base of antenna?, is the longest, and directed obliquely forward and outward, more than half as long as the carapace; the three others are smaller, but sharp.
Abdomen sculptured, first to sixth segment with a median keel, that of the third arched and produced somewhat posteriorly, that ofthesixth finely furrowed and ending in twospines posteriorly.
Two other spines are placed at the posterior margin of this segment, one on each side.
Fifth segment, on the posterior margin, near the median line, with a sharp spine on each side.
Lateral faces of the first to fifth segment sculptured by two irregular transverse furrows, sixth segment laterally with an indistinct longitudinal ridge.
EpimeTa of the first to fourth segment triangular, inferior angles blunt, without spines.
Keel of sternum dentate, but not spinoso-serrate.
Two specimens are in the Museum of the Academy of Natural Science of Philadelphia.

Considerations concerning the geographical distribution of the Crangoiiidn .
The geographical distribution of the Crangoiida shows that only one genus, Pontocaris, no doubt the most primitive, is a true inhabitant of the lesser depths of the tropics, the two species known being found in 49 and 140 fathoms in the IndoMalaysian seas.
All the other genera are partly confined to the seas of temperate or cold climates, partly there is the main range, and only a few species are present in the litoral of warmer climates.
Pontocarix, I believe, must be regarded as a survival in the tropics, and its occurrence in somewhat deeper water, but within the limits of the litoral, shows already the tendency to descend into greater depths developed in many species of the other Crangonidce.
None of the other species present in the tropical parts of the world can be regarded as survivals ; they immigrated thither from the more northern localities.
The main range of the genus Crangon comprises the cooler seas of the northern hemisphere both in the Atlantic and Pacific.
There are three species showing a true circumpolar distribution: Or.
salebrosus, boreas and crangon.
The two first named must be regarded as true arctic animals, extending southward, it is true, in more temperate climates, but preferring considerable depths, from about 100 to 400 fathoms.
Crangon crangon lives in very shallow water, extending not as far northward as Or.
salebrosus and bonus, and a connection between the Atlantic and Pacific (Japanese) localities is not known.
Perhaps such a connection was only present in former times, and this species can not be counted among the circumpolar ones, but is a survival of a formerly more extended distribution.
The two varieties of Crangon crangon described above prefer deeper water, 50 and 60 fathoms, and they are restricted to one of the northern parts of the two great oceans, affinis being found in the northern Pacific from Japan to California, allmanni in northern Europe.
Of the other species of Crangon eight show a distribution similar to the two last varieties.
Five are litoral and restricted to the northern part of the Pacific, especially Or.
sharpi and intermedins to the most northern parts (Berings Sea and Alaska), Cr.
angusticauda to Japan, and Or.
in a n it us and franciscorum to the western coast of United States.
The latter replaces the typical Or.
crangon on this coast.
A sixth species, Or.
agassizi, is found in the Atlantic near the eastern coast of United States, and must be regarded as a true deep sea animal, being recorded from about 200 to 900 fathoms.
It is replaced on the western side of America by a nearly allied abyssal species, Or.
procax, 660-900 fathoms.
On the western coast of Central America is found a second abyssal species, Or.
atrox, between 600 and 700 fathoms, being closely related to the northern circumpolar Or.
salebrosus.
The presence of these three abyssal species on both sides of the American continent indicate a relation to the northern circumpolar seas, according to their affinities with the northern circumpolar species of the subgenus Sclerocravgon, but I do not believe that this demonstrates the connection of the western and eastern American seas in the tertiary period within the litoral, as held to-day generally by authors.
Finally there are two antarctic species: Cr.
,capensis from the Cape of Good Hope, and Cr.
antarctieus from South Georgia.
The latter is regarded by Pfeffer 11 as a proof of the bipolar distribution of Orangon.
I have doubted the correctness of Pfeffer's opinion in this view, 12 and have pointed out that the examples of bipolar distribution of Crustacea enumerated by him do not correspond exactly to the facts known, except in the case of Or.
antarcticus.
But neither in this species, is, I believe, a bi polarity of the genus probable.
Or.
antarcticus is the nearest allied to Or.
franeiscorum and this fact induces me to suppose that a connection between the northern and southern range of Orangon is present along the west coast of America from California to Chili, and in the same manner, I believe, there is a connection from the European seas along the western coast of Africa to the Cape of Good Hope, the locality of Or.
capensis.
Literal species of Orangon have not yet been recorded from the western coasts of America and Africa, but I hope that further investigation will demonstrate the presence of this genus in both localities, and thus strengthen my theory.
Supposing my theory to be correct, the range of Orangon would be a northern circumpolar one, partly containing circumpolar species, partly species confined to the northern parts either of Pacific or of Atlantic.
Some species descended into the deep sea to a depth of about 900 fathoms and -could propagate more southward.
Along the west coasts of Africa and America, owing to the cooler temperature of the seas on these coasts, the range of Orangon could extend to the southern hemisphere, crossing the tropics.
The range of the genus Neetocrangon, the nearest allied of Orangon, agrees wholly with that of the northern species of Orangon: one species, Neetocrangon lar, is a true arctic-circumpolar one extending very little southward (the most southern locality recorded is Nova Scotia), the other, Neetocrangon alaskensis, is restricted, as we know, at present to Alaska.
The genus Pontophilus, the first of the series, representing the second branch of development arising from Pontocaris, has a nearly cosmopolitan horizontal distribution, but the several species are wholly different from each other.
The greatest number of species, like Orangon, is found in the litoral of the cooler seas of the northern hemisphere, 11 Pfeffer, Die niedere Thierwelt des antarctischeii Ufergehietes.

12 Ortmaim, Jenaisclie Denkschriften, VIII, 1894, p. 77. but their range does not extend very far northward.
Accordingly, arctic circumpolar species are not known, the northern literal species being restricted to comparatively narrow districts, each to one side of the great oceans.
Only one species, P. norvegicus, in the northern Atlantic, is found on both the European and American shores.
Eight species are found in the European seas: P. echinulatus, spinosus, pattersoni, sculptus, bispinosus, trispinosus, fasciatus, neglectus; one on the east coast of United States : P. brevirostris.
As the cooler waters of the western African coast allow a more southward extension, a mediterranean specie's, P. cataphractus, ranges southward to the Senegambia.
In the Pacific northern species are not known, but two having a more southward range: P. bidentatus in Japan, P. carinicauda in China.
The presence of the latter in the tropics is due, I believe, to a more recent immigration.
Of the northern litoral species some show a very large bathymetrical range, descending to considerable depths, especially P. echinulatus, brevirostris to 150 fathoms, P. norvegicus to 500 fathoms.
The next to the latter species, as regards the depth inhabited, are P. bengalensis, andamanensis, junceus, being found in the tropical seas of India and Indo-Malaysia in depths of about 100 to 300 fathoms, and, farther, five species are true deep sea animals.
One of these, P. profundus, is only found near Sydney in 2,600 fathoms, another, P. occidentalis, off the west coast of Central America in 900-2,200 fathoms.
The three others show the characteristic wide range of the true abyssal animals, Pont, gracilis being found in the Atlantic and Indian oceans from 200 to 700 fathoms, P. abyssi in the North Atlantic and Indian oceans from 1700 to 2,200 fathoms, and P. ch alien geri in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans from 1,100 to 2,700 fathoms.
Lastly, two litoral species are known from the cooler seas of the southern hemisphere: P. australis from New Zealand, and P. intermedins from Southern Australia.
The horizontal and vertical range of Pontophilus may be summarized as follows: The main distribution of the genus is in the litoral of the northern hemisphere, especially in the temperate seas, a circumpolar rangeof none of the species is proven; a few litoral species extend more southward.
A great number of species have a tendency to descend into deeper water, and, accordingly, sonic species are found in the deeper water even of the tropics, and have occupied a large area of the deep sea.
In the cooler parts of the southern hemisphere is given the possibility to re-ascend into the litoral, and two litoral species are, in fact, found in Australia and New Zealand.
The genus Sabinea contains two northern species, one of which, S. septemearinata, is a true arctic circumpolar one, the other, S. sarsi, is found on both sides of the northern Atlantic.
Both descend into greater depths, to about 150 fathoms.
The third species, S. hystrix, is an abyssal one, found in 400 to nearly 900 fathoms, and its range extends more southward, from the eastern coast of United States to Guadeloupe in the West Indies.
The two known species of the most extreme genus of the second branch of Crangonidre, Paracrangon, live on the western coasts of America, probably in greater depths; at least P. areolatus is recorded from over 600 fathoms.
The last genus, Prionocrangon, is very peculiar and its affinities are not certainly known.
It probably is allied to Pontophilus, and then its habitat, in the deep sea of the Indian ocean, 200-400 fathoms, would not be strange, since Pontophilus contains also tropical species living in deeper water.
The distribution of Crangonidce may be thus summarized: The "regions of life" 13 in which Crangonidse are found, are the litoral and the abyssal.
Regarding the "fades," 14 the Crangoniclre are principally, as we know, benthonic 15 in sand and mud.
These habits admit a universal distribution of the family, but the genera and species are more restricted.
The litoral species especially are not cosmopolitan, but are confined by barriers.
Except the tropical genus Pontocaris,, which must be regarded as a survival, the litoral Crangonidse are almost exclusively limited to the northern hemisphere, and the seas of tropical temperature must be considered as the climatic barrier preventing the distribution of Crangonidie southward.
Only a few species are adapted to the warmer seas, especially Crangon catapkractus in Senegambia and Pontophilus carinicauda in China, Generally, the Crangonida3, originating in the cooler northern hemisphere, were 13 "Lebensbezirke," J. Walther, Bionomie des Meeres, 1893, p. 13-15, p. 87176.
— Walther does not give a satisfactory and correct definition of* this word, on account of wbicb his detailed discussion concerning this term is wholly out of place.
Notwithstanding, the idea of '" regions of life " is a very good one.
14 Walther, ibid.
p. 25-34.
15 See Haeckel, Planktonstudien, 1890, p. 18ff.
separated from the cooler parts of the southern by the broad belt of the warm circumtropical seas.
This zone, however, is not a continuous one, but is interrupted within the litoral on two tracts, on the western coasts of Africa and America.
At these two localities there are two causes producing a lower temperature of the litoral seas than is usual in the tropics.
On the one hand, there are cold currents running from the southern cold seas along both shores northward as far as the equator and even beyond ; on the other hand, on these coasts arises cold water from the sea-bottom, the equatorial currents directed from the coast to the west carrying away the surface water.
A cooling of the litoral waters of the west coasts of Africa and America is thus produced, and although the most superficial layers of water may be warmed by the sun, in greater depths within the litoral there may prevail a low temperature.
Thus, on the west coasts of Africa and America, it may be possible that northern litoral forms penetrate into the tropics and beyond, and may reach the litoral of the cooler antartic hemisphere.
The presence of Grangon capensis and C. antarcticus may be thus explained.
By adaption to a cooler temperature a large number of Crangonidse are able to descend to greater depths,"'' and by this habit they may enter and cross the tropics in the deep sea.
The species adapted to the greater depths show, as usually in deep sea animals, a very large horizontal range, and, therefore, they can reach the southern hemisphere, while a reascending into the litoral of the antarctic regions is possible.
We know of the genus Pontophilus, which is the only one containing true deep sea species of wide distribution, two species in southern Australia and New 7 Zealand, the presence of which is probably due to this cause.
Other barriers against the distribution of the species of Crangonidse are of a topographical character.
At first, the great continents of northern Eurasia and North America cause a complete separation of the northern temperate parts of the Atlantic and Pacific, and, therefore, these oceans contain distinct species.
Farther, the Crangonidse, living mostly benthonic, can not pass over great oceans, and, accordingly, the eastern and western shores both 16 The cold temperature is the main cause favoring immigration in the deep seas, and in the arctics the deep sea and the litoral are closely connected.
See Monaco, Zur Erforschung der Meere, etc., translated into German by Marenzeller, Wien, 1891, p. 135, and Pfeffer, Versuch iiber dor erdgeschichtliche Entwickelung der jetzigen Verbreitungsverh'iltnisseunsererTiervvolt, Hamburg, 1891. of the Pacific and Atlantic are inhabited by different species.
Only the true arctic species being able to live along the most northern shores of America and Asia show a circumpolar distribution, no topographic barriers of the kind mentioned there being present.
The species not living in the arctic, but in the boreal 17 seas, are restricted by such topographic barriers.
It is evident, therefore, that the means of dispersal of the Crangonidse, except Pontocaris and a few species of Pontophilus, do not act against the climatic barriers and mostly also not against the topographic.
Only a few known species are present on both shores of the Atlantic: Pontophilus norvegicus (100-150 fath.)
and Sabinea sarsi (60-150 fath.).
Whether these species can pass over the barrier formed by the northern Atlantic as adult animals or as larva 1 , or whether this distribution is due to other causes, we can not say at present.
On the shores of the Atlantic and Pacific very nearly allied species are sometimes found.
These must be derived from common ancestors living when the arctic ocean was not as cold as at present, and when a circumpolar connection was present for these species as in the case of the circumpolar forms now living.
Later these species retreated more southward, and by the topographic separation of the range, the morphological characters could change, and distinct forms could develop.
The geographical distribution of the Crangonidse is a very characteristic one and important as limiting the northern zoo-geographical regions of the litoral.
Apart from a few species living in the tropics, in the antarctic and in the deep sea, the family of Crangonidre characterizes the northern circumpolar region, as defined by me formerly.
18 This region is characterized by the genera Nectocrangon and Sabinea.
Among the northern species we can distinguish true arctic species showing a circumpolar range, especially Crangon salebrosus, boreas, Nectocrangon lar, Sabinea septemcarinata, and boreal species.
The latter are not circumpolar, but more restricted.
Crangon crangon affinis is restricted to the Pacific, Pontophilus norvegicus and Sabinea sarsi to the Atlantic.
The other species are more localized and characterize each a separate local fauna, and we can distinguish a Japanese fauna, a fauna of the Berings Sea, a fauna of the western coast of 17 Regarding the distribution of "arctic" and "boreal" seas see Pfeffer, Versuch, etc., 1891.
18 Jenaiscbe Denkschriften, VIII, 1804, p. 78.
America.
Characteristic of the first is Grangon angusticanda ; Pontophilus bidentatus; of the second, Grangon sharpi, C. intermedins, Nedocrangon alaskensis ; of the third, Grangon munitus, G. franciscorum, Paraerangon echinatus.
19 In the Atlantic, we have species peculiar to the European coasts: Grangon crangon allmanni, Povtophilus echinatus, P. spinosus, P. pattersoni, P. seulptus, P. bispinosus, P. trispinosus, P. fasciatus, P. neglectus, and one peculiar to the east coast of America: Pontophilus breviorostris.
Accordingly, within the limits of the arctic region we can distinguish three sub-regions: 1.
The arctie-eircumpolcvr; 2. the Aflai dieboreal; 3. the Pacific-boreal, The two latter are divided into local faunas, the Atlantic into the northern European and the fauna of the east coast of United States; the Pacific into the local faunas of the Berings Sea, of Japan, and of the west coast of North America.
The arctic litoral region is the centre of origin of the family of Crangonidfe, and the centre of its development.
The geographical distribution of the species not living within the arctic litoral may be characterized and classified as follows: 1.
Survivors of a more cosmopolitan distribution in the tropics of Indo-Malaysia: Pontocaris propensalata., P. pennata.
2.
Immigrants into the litoral of warmer seas from the northern litoral : Pontophilus cataphractus , P. carinicauda.

'•' Paraerangon echinatus is perhaps an abyssal species, judging from tlie depth recorded for Paraerangon areolatus.
20 Some of these species maybe more widely distributed.
The occurrence of the recently described Aegean orientalis Henderson, from the litoral of the Burmese coast (Gulf of Martabem) is remarkable, because this species is said to be related to the Mediterranean Pontophilus cataphraebus.
It may, however, belong to the genus Pontecaris, and the description and figure given by Henderson do not refute this supposition.
