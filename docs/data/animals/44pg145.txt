BIRDS COLLECTED BY THE WEST GREENLAND EXPEDITION.
BY WITMER STONE.
The collection of birds herein described was obtained June 26 to August 11, 1891, by the West Greenland Expedition under command of Prof. Angelo Heilprin.
The specimens were collected by Dr. William E. Hughes, Ornithologist of the Expedition, and Dr. Benjamin Sharp, Zoologist-in-Charge, the principal localities where collecting was carried on being Disco Island, Duck Island (Lat.
73° 57' N.), Melville Bay, Cape York, and McCormick Bay (Lat.
77° 43' N.).
Twenty-one species are represented in the Greenland collection which numbers 147 specimens and there are in addition 16 specimens obtained at Sydney, Nova Scotia, Gulf of St. Lawrence and Strait of Belle Isle.
jNIost of the birds collected w^ere in full breeding plumage and were undoubtedly on their breeding grounds.
In the following list I have given the results of careful measurements of all the specimens, and notes in regard to peculiarities of plumage, etc.
1.
Cepphus grylle ;L).
Black Guillemot.
Only one specim.^n of this bird was procured, a male shot on the Waigat, Disco Island, August 8.
The wing measures 6*50 inches and the culmen 1*44 inches.
2.
Cepphus mandtii (Licht) Mandt's Guillemot.
Specimens of Mandt's Guillemot were collected in Melville and McCormick Bays and the series obtained shows considerable variation in plumage.
One is uniform black while the others are somewhat speckled with white feathers below and have many of the feathers of the interscapular region tipped with white.
The white wing coverts in these specimens have distinct black tips and some of them are slightly dusky at the extreme base.
These mottled birds are possibly one or two years old and the uniform black garb may not be acquired for several years.
Three nestlings, measuring about six inches in length, are in the collection.
They are covered with long and very soft dull black down.
The bills have a small white conical projection near the extremity of the upper mandible.
The feet of the adults were briglit red in life, while those of the you no; were black.

Alle alle (Linn).
Little Auk, Dovekie.
A series of forty-seven Little Auks is contained in the collection, most of which were shot off Cape York, July 22 and 23.
The birds are all in full breeding jjlumage and show scarcely any variations in markings.
Measurements of forty specimens (19 males and 21 females) give the following results: Maximum.

One specimen was shot on the AVaigat, Disco, Aug. 7.
The measurements are as folloAvs: Wing 13-75 inches.
Culmen 1-63 inches.
Tail 6 inches.
6.
Stercorarius parasiticus (Linn).
Parasitic J-aeger.
This .species was not noticed by the Expedition, but a dried skin was procui-ed from the natives at Godhaven which seems referable 'AH measurements of "length" were taken in the flesh by Dr. Hughes, to whom I am indebted for them.
The other measurements were made from the dried skins, the length of culmen being from its extreme base to tip of upper mandible unless otherwise stated.
All dimensions are in inches and hundredths.

The bill is much heavier than any of the specimens of S. longicuudns, the plumage above is decidedly more sooty and the tarsi are entirely uniform in color with the feet.
The two species are, however, very difficult to separate owing to the great amount of individual variation which they exhibit.
The specimen of S. parasiticus measures as follows: Wing 12-85 inches.
Culmen 1-27 inches.
Tail 8-05 inches.
7.
Stercorarius longicaudus Vieill.
Long-tailed Jaeger.
The specimens of Long-tailed Jaegers, all of which were collected July 16 in Melville Bay, show great variation in plumage and no two in the series of seven are exactly alike.
All have the tarsi blue-gray strongly contrasted with the black feet, though the light color sometimes terminates above the small hind toe and sometimes extends below it to the upper part of the foot.
No.
26,909, (Acad.
Coll.
), female, appears to be most typical of the adult bird.
The plumage in this specimen is nowhere barred or mottled; the throat and breast are pure white passing gradually into slate gray about the middle of the abdomen, and this color becomes darker on the under tail coverts.
On the sides of the breast the gray reaches forward to the shoulders, while the under wing coverts are blackish slate.
The back is slate gray, darker on the wings ; the primaries and tail are black.
In No.
26,905, female, the gray reaches farther up on the breast and the central tail feathers are not so long.
In No.
26,904, female, (du.sky phase ?)
the whole lower surface is suifused with sooty gray, though this color is not uniform, as there are a considerable number of white feathers scattered over the breast.
The upper surface is mottled with slate-gray and dusky feathers.
The under tail coverts and flanks are transversely barred with white but the under wing coverts are plain dark slate.
No.
26,903, female, shows distinct traces of dark transverse bars over the lower breast and abdomen, and has dark shaft lines to the feathers of the throat.
Most of the under tail coverts are barred with white and the under wing coverts are barred and mottled.
No.
26,907, male, is similar but has the breast pure white while the barrings on the under wing and tail coverts, sides and flanks are very distinct.
The throat is very strongly marked wdth dusky shaft stripes while many of the feathers of the back show transverse bars of Avhite.
Other specimens are like the mature white-breasted birds but still have the under wing coverts and axillaries barred.
As none of the specimens above described were birds of the year it is reasonable to suppose that it takes at least two years for the species to acquire the full adult plumage.
The great variety of coloration exhibited by these Jaegers makes it difficult to arrange them in any order which will show the steps in the transition from young to old.
It seems to me most probable that the normal plumage of the bird of one year is shown by No.
26,907, while the young "bird of the year" doubtless shows still more barring, perhaps even on the breast.
As this bird appi'oaches the adult stage (i. e. No.
26,909) the barrings are gradually replaced by uniform slate gray.
The specimen No.
26,904 may, I think, represent a partial dusky phase as the suftusion of sooty feathers on the under surface is very decided, much more so than in any of the young birds, with which I at first placed it.
The dusky feathers moreover, do not form transverse bands as in the young birds and the under wing coverts are uniform slate colored like those of the adults.
The under tail coverts are, however, still barred with white.
Iftiiis really represents a dusky phase, it seems to be the first recorded instance of it in this species, though it occurs regularly in the closely related iS.
parasitmis.
If, however, we consider this as a young bird it would indicate that the adult plumage is assumed very differently by different individuals, as there is another specimen which has not a trace of dusky marks on the breast but which has the under wing coverts strongly barred.

Somateria mollissima borealis Brehm.
Greenland Eider.
Five male Eider Ducks and an equal number of females were collected at Duck Island, Lat.
73° 57' N., July 2.
They appear to be referable to S. mollissima borealis Brehm, but the measurements of the bill are rather different from those given in Ridgway's Manual.
In the key to species on page 109 this race is placed in a division with the true S. mollissima headed "Distance from anterior point of loral feathering to extremity of naked angle on side of forehead much greater than from same point to Lip of upper mandible."
In the present series, however, the reverse is the case or else the two measurements are about equal.
As these specimens were taken in the upper part of Baffin Bay, they represent the extreme northwestern form of the S. mollissima stock and are farthest removed geographically from typical S. mollissima.
It is, therefore, not surprising that they should exhibit the greatest differences from the typical S, mollissima and it is probable that specimens from fartlier south will be found to appi'oach true S. mollissima in the dimensions of the bill as well as in other respects, in proportion as their breeding range approaches that of the latter race.
The measurements of the five breeding males are as follows : Naked Bill from angle from Bill from anterior anterior posterior edge of edge of Length (in end of loral loral Acad.

Lagopus rupestris reinhardti (Brehm.)
Greenland Ptarmigan.
A female and three young nearly full grown were collected at Disco Island, July 8, ana two adult males Avere obtained at the same place, August 7.
All the specimens are in the summer plumage though one ot the males shows a few^ white feathers on the upper breast.
18.
Falco rusticolus gyrfalco (Linn.)
Gyrfalcon.
One specimen obtained from the natives at Disco.

Plectrophenax nivalis (Linn.)
Snow Bunting.
There is a series of twelve Snow Buntings in the colleetiou, including breeding males and females, moulting specimens, and young in the first plumage.
Two young birds were collected at McCormick Bay, July 29, an adult male at Upernavik, July 1 and the rest at Disco, June 28 and 29 and August 11.
The breeding birds sliow very distinctly the process of moulting by the wearing away of the brown tips of the feathers.
All the feathers of the back are very much pointed in the middle and cut away or concave on the sides, all the rusty borders which characterize the winter specimens being worn off.
Some specimens, however, show ragged remains of these borders on the coverts and tertials.
Two young birds of the year from McCormick Bay are strongly tinged with buff on the lower back and rump as well as on the under surface, while a young bird from Disco is much grayer.
Adult birds collected August 11 at Disco are all well advanced in their moult and the lower mandible is yellow instead of black as in the breeding bird.
The brown edgings to the feathers are rich chocolate, very distinct from the faded buff brown of winter examples from Pennsylvania.
It is interesting to note that all but one of the adult birds collected at Disco, August 11, have the wing and tail feathers completely grown and have about half the other feathers replaced by the brown edged plumage, while birds of the year taken at the same time and place have the wing feathers only partly grown and have not begun to moult elsewhere.
This fact may be of interest to students of bird migration as it shows that the old birds were at least ready for the southern journey before the young.

Lapland Longspur.
A series of eight Longspurs was procured at Disco, June 28 and 29 and August 11.
Those collected on the last date had advanced in their moult even farther than the Snow Buntings.
The adults were in complete winter garb with the exception of the tail feathers some of which were not quite fully grown.

A New Species of Pachychilus.
— Mr. H. A. Pilsbry exhibited and described a species of fresh-water snail, as follows : Pachychilus (polygonatus Lea?
var.)
Rovirosai.
Shell large and heavy, elevated conical, the lateral outlines straight above, modified by the slight convexity of the whorls below.
Spire more or less truncated at tip, half-grown specimens, PI.
VIII, fig.
9, possessing 8 remaining whorls ; adults, PI.
VIII, fig.
10, having one or two whorls less.
Surface most minutely spirally striated, the stri?e visible only under a lens.
Young and half-grown specimens are otherwise smooth, except for very slight spiral lirse toward the base.
When a little more than half-grown, there appear coarse, oblique, curved wave-like folds on the body-whorl, extending to the periphery but not below it.
Simultaneously with these undulations, begin spiral spaced lirse crossing them, which are slightly more prominent on the crests of the waves.
This sculpture continues upon all subsequent volutions.
The last volution of an adult specimen is slightly compressed below the suture, then quite convex.
It has ten waves, and about nine spiral lir?e, but the number of these last is quite variable on different specimens.
The color is olive in young, blackish in old examples ; interior of the mouth white, maculated with brown at the position of the periphery and folds.
This marking is also seen on the eroded spire in some specimens.
Aperture ovate, acute above, slightly exceeding one-third the total length of the shell.
Columella white, regularly arcuate,, spreading in a brown-tinted callus.

to be a very distinct species when compared with the typical forms of the described Mexican Pachychili ; but these, like all Melauians, are so variable that it is scarcely desirable to multiply species until fuller collections are made.
It is here associated with Lea's Melania polygonata because that species is the first described of the particular group of forms to which the pi-esent species or variety belongs.
