DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF Smynthurus
BY J NO.
A. RYDER.
Smynthurus qnadrimaculata Nob.
Park brown nearl black on the sides  median dorsal and ventral surfaces ligliter spring and middle of legs still more pale.
Its distinguishing character consists in the two pure white spots low down on each side of the abdomen the posterior ones larger than the anterior by onethird to onehalf are arranged when the back of the animal is vieweil from alove in an equilateral quadrangle.
The surrounding dark color immediately bordering the white spots is intense but becomes paler more remote from them in all directions and especially on the middle of the iack.
Antennoe fourjointed smynthuriform resembling those of S. Bourlefii Gerv
Length from front of head to tip of abdomen .5 mm.
 vertical diameter of abdomen .3 mm.
 width of abdomen .23 mm.
This remarkabl' beautiful little Collembolan was found in company with a large species of Fapirius apparently near P. ornafus Nicolet feeding on a polyporous fungus which grew on a stump in a damp shad ravine in East Fairmount Park.
It is one of the smallest of our American species of Sinijnfhuridae and is totall' distinct from any described by Sa3' Harris or Fitch some of which are no doubt Papiriidse.
It may be one of the species which the latter entomologist mentions as being known to him but to which he did not give names.
The descriptions of both Hai'ris and Fitch in the alsence of good figures are vague and unsatisfactory.
The species I have no doubt will prove to be one new to science.
In form it greatly resembles the S. Bourletii but in marking and color it is so totall' distinct that it would be immediately recognized as different.

Foraminiferouii Shells of our Const.
 Prof. Leidy remarked that the vast numbers of Foraminiferous shells.
Avhicii formed a constituent of the seaside sands had been a sulject of frequent notice.
Feeling interested to know their proportionate quantity on the comparatively barren shore of Xew Jersey he had examined the sand at Atlantic Cit' and at Cape iMay.
The sand in these localities mainly consists of quartz with Ijlack grains often in considerable quantity and formerly largely collected for  writing sand which he supposed to consist of ilraenite and magnetite.
Among these were also brilliant red particles which he suiposed to be garnet.
All these materials are the comaratively insoluble residue of our inland gneissic and other rocks.
In sand scraped uj from the surface between the tides at Atlantic City he had found the Foraminiferous shells all of one species of Nonionina resembling that figured bKhrenberg as N. polyjyora.
They w'ere found in the proportion of aliont ID 000 to the ounce avoirdupois of sand.
In sand obtained in the same manner at Cape May there were about 88000 shells of the single species just named to the ounce avoirdupois of sand.
The sands on the rocky Xew England coast are much richer in Foraminiferous shells both in numbers and kinds lnt they are generall' smaller.
In sand from the bathing beach at Newport R. I. collected from the white lines left by the edge of the waves there were 280000 shells to the ounce of sand.

On Crustaceans at Cape May N. J.
 Prof. Leidy remarked that in a recent visit to Cape May X. J. he had been struck with the immense numbers of the Mole Crab Hippa talpoidea which inhabited tlie beach between tides.
They were especially alnindant above the village of Ocean Grove but were also numerous lelow this oint down as far as the lighthouse.
They were generally 3oung and not larger than the little finger nail.
A few oiil' were of mature size.
In many positions they were so numeioiis that they appeared like rolling jebbles as they were exposed b' the breaking of the surf on the shore and as they rapidly followed the receding waves and buried themselves in the sand.
The sand on being dug up was found lo be as full of them as an ordinary ilumpuddiiig is of currants.
Below Ocean Grove near lowtide mark the Lady Crab PlatyoniaJnis occellatuH was frequent.
Above Ocean Grove and above the hightide line in the dry sand and in the bank covered witli Seasand Grass Calaiyiagrostis arenaria the burrows of the Sand Crab Ocypoda arenaria were numerous and the animals frequent.
One of these crabs brought home after eight days was still in good condition Avithout once having been in water.
It appeared to be fond of meat of any kind and had been fed on beef and oysters.
Supplementary Note on the Aeronautic Flight of Spiders.
 Kev.
H. C. McCooK remarked that in the Proceedings of the Academy for 187Y pp.
308312 would be found the result of some observations made by liim upon the ballooning habits of spiders wliich he was now able to supplement by several important items.
The facts which he had to detail were observed Oct. 1 1878 upon the farm of Mr. Geo.
B. Lownes about ten miles from Philadelphia in Delaware County and they would best be presented by giving the record made in his notebook of the flight of several spiders.
The day was warm and bright and a gentle breeze was blowing throughout the da but not stcadil' from anquarter.

Its flight was across a wide meadow and promised to be a long one.
Several threads were streaming out and up behind and before the spider.

A saltigrade probably the young of Hentz's Attus vitlatus on the side of a fenceboard opposite the wind.
Its legs elevated raising u the body aljdomen turned well nigh straight upward long thread floating out and up from the spinnerets  it walked several inches upward along the rail keeping its body in the same stilted position the thread meanwhile flying and then was off rather slowly and aliont on a line with the face.
There was one small thread in front and one or more behind.
It moved straight forward for about 50 feet and then rose suddenly upward.

Lycosa.
Back down  sailed sidcwise part of the time  head forward apparently afterward.
lauy of the aeronauts noticed first turned the elevated abdomen to various points as though testing the direction of the wind.
lost of the points noted in tlie previous communication were conlirmed and those together with these now presented seem to make quite complete the mode of ballooning at least among the Citigrade and perhaps also the Saltigrade Spiders.
The whole process maybe briefl3' given as follows 1.
The spider seeks a high position as tiie top of a fence post as the point of ascent 2.
The abdomen is elevated to as nearly a right angle with the ceihalothorax as may be 3.
A eucil of llireads is issued from the spinnerets the face leing meaiuvhile turned to various points until it looks in the direction of the wind  4.
The legs are stretched upward thus raising the body aloft 5.
They gradually incline in the direction of the breeze the joints straighten out the legs sink forward and down till the first pair are almost on the level with the post the whole attitude of the animal ieing that of one resisting some force exerteil from above  0.
Suddenly and simultaneously the eight claws are unloosed and the spider mounts with a sharp bound apparently  7. and floats off with  the back downward generally but sometimes with this position reversed  8.
At first the abdomen seems to be in advance but generall' the body is turned so that the head rides in front 9.
The pencil of threads is caught apparently by the feet and floats out in front upon which 10 sometimes the spider will dim
upward as thougli to adjust the centre of gravity 11.
Meanwhile a thread or pencil of rays issues from the spinnerets which floats out behind leaving the spider to ride in the angle of the two pencil or 12 as it sometimes liappens of tliree whicli diverge widely at the upper free ends  13.
The feet seem to be united by delicate filaments which would serve to increase the buo'ancy of the balloon 14.
The spider now is carried forward ly the wind riding for long distances in an open space and often borne high upwaid upon ascending currents 15.
Its anchorage appears at times to be in its own volition by drawing in witli the claws the forward pencil and gathering it in a white roll within the mandibles  but 16 most frequently the balloonist is stopped by striking against some elevated object or by the subsidence of the breeze 17.
A bright warm dajin October is commonlchosen for the ascent and 18 judging from the presence of a number of dry moults upon many posts apparenth' of the same species of spider observed in flight the animals had recently cast their skins.
Of tlie aboA'e points Nos.
3 7 0 10 11 in part 12 14 in part 15 in part and 18 are those which were determined by the last observation.
Tiie object of this interesting habit seems to be the distribution of species.
Siiniaii Chmacters in Negro Biriuis.
 Dr. A.J.
Parker remarked that in a previous communication on the convolutions of the negro brain he had pointed out in one negro brain out of thirteen then examined the existence of an internal inferior pli de passage wliich was as well developed as in any of tlie Simiadfc.
In tliat brain the convolution measured a quarter of an inch in width and completely separated the parietooccipital or internal perpendicular fissure from the calcarine so that this region presented tiie same appearance as it does in the Simians.
This convolution is uniformly present in the brain of all the Simiadte thus far described except in Aleles paniscuK Huxle' and Hylobates Bischoff.
It had not been found in a fulldeveloped condition inman before and the absence of this small bridging convolution had been regarded b' some anatomists as a distinguishing peculiarity of the human as compared vvith the anthropoid brain.
Since then he had found this convolution present in another adult female negro brain.
It was fully developed up to the surface presented a superficial width of an eighth of an inch and completely separated the parietooccipital from the calcarine fissure.
This convolution was therefore present in two cases out of thirtythree negro brains examined.
Turner describes Edinburgh Medical Journal 1860 a brain in which the fissure of Rolando joined the fissure of Sylvius completel' tlie small bridging convolution which usually' separates them being completely absent.
Pansch states that sometimes there is a superficial connection between these two fissvrres.
Ecker says he has never met with such an instance.
Dr. Parker had observed in one instance in the brain of an adult male negro the complete connection of these two fissures no trace of a bridging or separating convolution being present.

Notice of a Tetrarhynchus
 Prof. Leidy stated that in the Remora.
or Sucker from our coast ireseiited this evening by Mr. Holbrook he had found a curious parasite.
This was inclosed in a compressed oval cyst pearly white thickwalled and about iialf an inch long tightly adherent to the intestine of tlie fish.
The cyst contained a flaskshaped translucent whitish sac which was feebly contractile and furnished at the narrow end with two minute papillae which were slowly protruded and retracted.
Within this sacworm coiled up about the centre was an opaque white worm or scolex which proved to be a TetrarhynchuH.
Removed and extended it measured 7 lines long and was divisible about equally into a broad anterior body portion and a posterior narrow taillike portion.
The head was formed of a pair of obcordate lothria inclined from each other.
Four long tortuous proboscides extended through the body and projected from the head.
The projecting portions were successively elongated and shortened b' eversion and inversion and were armed with recurved hooks.
The hooks extended within half the length of the proboscides and as they were everted and inverted apeared like the streaming of liquid through narrow tubes.
The tortuous proboscides at the bottom were continuous with as many elliptical pedestals placed at the back part of the body.
The tail about lialf the width of the body was not segmented but exhibited a disposition to assume this condition.
The end was slightl' tapering and occupied b' a bellshaped sinus opening externally and alternately contracting and expanding.
The interior of the sinus was lined and its mouth thickly furnished with nonvibratile cilia.
The species appeared to be undescribed and was named Tetrarhynchustenuicaudatus.

RECOVERY OF ALL THE FACULTIES IN A PIGEON FROM WHICH FOURFIFTHS OF THE UPPER PORTION OF THE CEREBRUM HAD BEEN REMOVED.
By J. Jl.
McQuiLLEN M.l.
Monday FclriKiiy 4th 1878 in illustration of my lobular course of lectuies on IMiysiology in tlie Pliilalelliia DinLal College I exposed the ceiebiiiin of a pigeon as I have regularh' done each session for the past twenty years and cut out fourfifths of the upper portion in slices to illustrate tiie fact that the sensorium thus exposed could be cut pinched or burned witiiout any manifestation of sutiering on the part of the animal.
The usual phenomena attendant upon the operation followed i. e. profound stujjor the bird standing motionless on the table with eyes closed the head sunk between.
the shoulders and the feathers ruffled.
When pushed it opened its eyes and movel tiie bod' when thrown into the air it flew a few feet and then on lighting relapsed into somnolency with an evident obliviousness to surrounding objects until again aroused by handling.
In this condition along with another pigeon from Avhich the cerebellum had been removed it was shown to the members of the IJiological and Microscopical Section of the Academjof Natural Sciences on the evening of that day at the regular monthly meeting of the Section.
Prof. Emily White M.D. Professor of Physiology in the Woman's Medical .
'oUege who was present having manifested much interest in the iigeons I offered to send them to the Woman's College so that she could show them to the students with the request that an effort should be made to keep them alive and ascertain whether the functions of tlie cerebrum and cerebellum would bo restored.
Other duties of an absorbing character so occupied my time and attention that I had quite forgotten the request made by me until March when a note was received from Prof. White stating that  the pigeon from which the cerebrum was partially removed seems to have recovered all his faculties.
He is perhaps less excitable than normal seems perfectly tame but briglit.
.
.
.
The other iigeon died on the third da' after the removal of the cerebellum.
I at once sent for the pigeon and was surprised at the complete recovery of the voluntary movements of walking and flying the power of feeding itself and drinking as usual and the general manifestation of intelligence.
There could be no question about the identity of the pigeon.
It was of a peculiar breed and the cicatrix on the neck where the incision had been made so as tothrow the scalp back and expose the cranium along with a soft place dn the latter from which a portion of bone had been removed left no doubt on that point.
I again exhibited it at the monthly meeting of the Biological and Microscopical Section March 4th and tlie memlers were surprised to find it fly about from one end of a long room and back again feed itself etc.
I asked then and I repeat now the same question How are we to account for the restoration of these functions 
Is it due to the fact that the small portion of the cerebrum left after the operation assumed the functions of the entire organ or has there besn a regeneration of the part removed 
Yulpian one of the most accurate and reliable of the recent experimentalists and observers of these phenomena positively asserts that an animal from which the cerebral hemispheres have been removed is incapable of a spontaneous voluntary movement.
In this he is apparentl supported by every observer with only one exception Yoit.
The latest author in writing on tiiis sulject M. Foster whose views may be regarded as summing those generally entertained saj's  When the cerebral hemispheres are removed from a bird the animal is able to maintain a completely normal posture and that too when the corpus striata and optic thalami are taken away at the same time.
It will balance itself on one leg after the fashion of a bird which in a natural way has gone to sleep.
In fact the appearance and behavior of a bird which has been deprived of its cerebral hemispheres are strikingly similar to those of a bird sleepy and stupid.
Left alone in perfect quiet it will remain impassive and motionless for a long time it may be for an almost indefinite time.
When stirred it moves and then on being left alone returns to a natural easy position.
Placed on its side or on its back it will regain its feet thrown into the air it flies with considerable precision for some distance lefore it retuins to rest.
It frequently tucks its head under its wings and if by judicious feeding it has been kept alive for some time after the operation it may be seen to clean its feathers and to pick up corn ' A Text Book of Physiology by M. Foster M.A. M.D. F.R.S.

It may be induced to move not only by ordinary stimuli applied to the skin but also by sudden sharp sounds or flashes of light and it is evident that its movements arc to a certain extent guided by visual sensations for in its flight it will though imperfectly avoid obstacles.
Save that all signs of volition are absent that the movements are on the whole clumsy resembling rather those of a stupid drowsy bird than those of one quite wide awake there is very little to distinguish such a bird from one in full possession of its cerebral hemispheres.
There is but one other case on record that I have met with where there has been a recovery of voluntary action on the part of a pigeon from which the cerebral hemispheres had been removed and I was not aware of that fact until the experience with my pigeon induced me to make a careful examination of the literature of the subject.
I refer to the pigeon kept alive by Voit for five months after the cerebral lobes had been completely removed. 
At first the pigeon presented the phenomena usuali observed after this operation  but it gradually recovered until it seemed entirely normal with the single exception that it never would eat all food being introduced forcibly.
Five months after the operation the pigeon was killed and the encephalic cavity was found filled with a white substance containing darkbordered nervefibres and nervecells.
Voit never before observed anj'thing like regeneration of the nervous substance or so complete a restoration of the cerebral functions and he regarded this as an instance of anatomical and physiological regeneration of the hemispheres.
Flint from whom this extract has been taken goes on to say that the objections to accepting this observation with the physiological conclusions presented by Voit are that it is not only possible but probable that the hemispheres were not entirelj' removed and that the posterior portion of the encephalon had advanced to occupy in part the space originallj filled by the extirpated mass.
While we do not assume that anatomical and functional regeneration of the cerebrum in a pigeon is impossible it must be admitted that such an extraordinary state' Bischoff and Voit Sitzungsberichte Acad.

ment as that made b' Voit cannot be accepted without reserve merely upon the basis of a single observation.
In contrast to this case it must be remembered that I only removed the npper fourfifths of the cerebrum.
In doing this however the superficial gray matter of the liemisplieres recognized as the structure physiologicall3 concerned in the exercise of the faculties of attention perception memory and will was removed.
The subject of the present communication continued in the full possession of its faculties for six months when iu the presence of several scientific friends it was put to death under chloroform tind a jwtmorteni examination made.
On removing the scalp a fibrous structure analogous to pericranium was found occupying the place from which the bone had been removed in making the vivisection.
Cutting this away a small amount of fluid escaped and the cranial cavity thus exposed was found occupied b' a white substance resembling the cerebral structure that had been removed six montiis before.
Placing a section of the npper portion of this which had been stained with hematoxyline under the microscope a number of bipolar cells characteristic of the gray structure were observed.
That the bird should have survived such an operation and lived for six months after iu the full possession of its faculties is a remarkable illustration of tiie recuperative powers of the system.
And tiie regeneration of the parts removed is additional evidence in substantiation of the case reported by Voit.
Unwilling that such an important question should merely rest upon my own observation I requested the appointment of a committee by the Biological and Microscopical Section to examine the regenerated structure.
The following report on the microscopic characters of the regenerated tissue was prepared b Dr. Carl Seller Chairman of the Committee    The specimen handed to me b' Dr. J. H. McQuillen appeared to be the medulla cerebellum and part of the cerebrum of a bird.
Intimately connected with the parts were two tumorlike growths the one spherical and of the size of a pea  the other of irregular outline and smaller than tiie first. 
A microscopical examination of these growths revealed thcyn to be composed of nervetissue showing longitudinal and transverse 23 sections of iicrvcfiltn's aiid.

On Donax foHHor.
 Prof. Leidy remarked that last July while on a visit to Cape May N. J. he had oliserved on the beacii near low tide east of the town in many positions vast numbers of the little lamellibrancli mollusk Donax fuxtor of Say.
It is well named the Digger from the ease and rapidity with which it digs its way into the sand b' means of its powerful foot.
It lives in the surface sand and is uncovered by the suif lireaking on shore but instantly buries itself again as the waves retire.
In some places the little Digger was sf abundant that large patciies reminded him  of barley grains lying on a malting floor and tliey lay so thick as actually' to interfere with one anotlier in the attempt to bury themselves.
As indicated by Mr. Say tliey present two varieties one in which the shell is white tlie other in which it is strawcolored.
The shells generall' exhibit an interior livid tint in three rays successively widening from before backward.
The rays are sometimes feeble or nearly obsolete  the anterior one is the most persistent and the posterior one least so.
The siphons are long and aciivelprotruded and retracted looking in their movements like wriggling worms.
The Digger affords a bountiful suiply of food to shore birds and fishes.
As is so frequently the case with crowded communities the Digger is much infested with parasites.
From lialf a dozen to severd dozen Flukes are found in the liver and a ciliated infusorian in the branchial cavity.
The Fluke is a minute larval Disfomum. with the following characters oval obovate clavate or ninepin like head rounded with a conspicuous nipplelike papilla on each side which when seen in the lateral view of the animal gives the appearance of a beak to the head tail obtuse with a minute terminal pore.
Integument finel' granulate the granules arranged in alternating transverse series.
Oral acetabulum twice the size of the ventral which is central or nearly so.
Mouth large unarmed pharynx minute with a short narrow gullet ending in two pouchlike stomachs which extend to the ventral acetabulum.
A distinct body cavity with no other contained organs than those just mentioned.
A small orifice occupies the mefliiin line nearly midway between the acetabula  but no appearance of generative apparatus.
Length of animal in tlie contracted state .24 mm.
 width .15mm.
 length in the elongated state to .3G and .42 mm.
 width .09 mm.
Oral acetabulum .072 mm.
 ventral acetabulum .042 mm.
The species may be named Distomum cornifrons.
It is probable that this little Fluke undergoes its further development in some of the shore birds or fishes which use the Dunax foasor as food.
The infusorian infesting the Digger is a Trichodina resembling that wliieh is found on the Hydra or fresh water polyp and which is also stated by Stein to live on the gills of the Pike and the fins of the Stickleback.
Tiie Trichodine is bellshaped with a wreath of cils near the top and a circle of cils at the margin beneath.
It is .048 mm.
broad and from .035 to .036 mm.
high.
Though living on a marine mollusk it too nearly resembles the Trichodina pediculuH of freshwater animals for him to think of giving it another name.
Dimorphism in Mitchella repens.
 Mr. Thomas Meehan referred to note published in the Proceedings many years ago in regard to dimorphic flowers in Mitchella repens and suggesting that the plant was practically dioecious.
Three years ago he found a variety on the Wissahickon with snowwhite lerries  the plant judging by the size of the patch having been growing and bearing there man' years.
Some of this was removed to his garden where though it blossoms freely it bears no berries thus indicating that it was fertilized when in its wild state by the pollen from the normal scarlet berried forms in the vicinity and that it is incapable of making use of its own pollen.

Notices of Gordius in the Cockroach and Leech Prof. Leidy exhibited a Gordius which had been submitted to him by Dr. Robert Meade Smith of this city with the note that a servant killed a large cockroach Blatta orieutalis 
in the kitchen and threw it into a tumbler of water and had tlien noticed as she described it one of its legs growing and swimming off.
The Gordius is nine inches long chocolate brown with darker spots of the same attenuated anteriorly with the head rounded and the tail siival and at the end slightly compressed and roundly truncated.
Thickness of the worm anteriorly ith of a line posteriorly gths of a line.
The species is probably Gordius dquaticus.
Prof. L. further remarked that twent3' years ago he had collected from Lily Pond Newport U. I. a mimher of little leeches of two species of Clepnine which were much infested with delicate hairworms coiled up ill the interior of tlie body.
Tlie Clepsines were the fourth to the third of an iiicii in length 'Die most frequent of tile secies had two eyes the otlier liad tliree pairs of eyes.
The leeches contained from one to five of the hairworms ranging from 10 lines to 2 inciios in length.
'J'he worms aitpear to iertain to a species of Gordius which fi'om its slender cliaraeter may be named Gordius tenuis.
The worm is wliite or creamcolored but has leconie brown as preservd in alcoliol.
It is attenuated anteriorly with tlie head end tapering and conical the posterior end is curved tliickened and obtusely rounded.
A siiort oesophagus is succeeded by a simple straight capacious intestine imperforate at the josterior extremity.
A worm of two inclies in length measured O.OG mm.
near the head end 0.14 mm.
at the middle and 0.12 mm.
at the tail end.
A specimen 10 lines long measured at the middle 0.1 mm.
