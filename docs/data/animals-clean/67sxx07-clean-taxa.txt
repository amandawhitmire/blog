The Big Hachet Mountains.
The Big Hachet or Hacheta Grande Mountains are a short range in southern New Mexico in sight of the Mexican boundary.
They may be reached from the station of Hachita on the El Paso and Southwestern R. R. where provisions can be obtained.
Water must be hauled in unless the prospecting in progress at the time of our visit resulted in a successful well.
There are no trails in the mountains.
The extreme northern end of the range remains to be worked conchologically as we could not reach it from our camp.
A visit should be planned much earlier or later than ours August in order to have the advantage of what rain there is and also to avoid the excessive heat.
The highest peak Hacheta Grande has an elevation of about 8500 ft. and is considerably higher than any other in the group.
Several large canyons dissect the range two of them forming broad basins.
There are no springs in the range but sometimes after the infrequent rains a little water remains for a time in rocky basins in narrow canyons.
We found one such hole containing about half a barrel.
It was foul with drowned insects yet most welcome as our canteens were dry towards the end of a twoday trip to Big Hachet Mountain.
The colonies of snails here as in other desert mountains are usually of small area.
As the mountains are uninhabited and too dry for cattle ranges there are few local place names and no roads or ranches to aid in locating collecting points.
In the absence of any topographic map we reproduce a rough map made from our field notes which should enable anyone to exactly locate nearly every colony of snails found.
For convenient reference we have named several prominent landmarks such as Daniels Mountain  the highest peak northward as seen from Sheridan Canyon and Teocalli Butte west of our camp both being inhabited by special races of snails.
1 Named for the writer's coropanion on this somewhat arduous trip.
The Big Hach'ets are without timber.
Only the higher peaks are in the pinyon zone.
There are some scrubby cedars and old gnarled pinyon pines nowhere numerous.
On some of the higher slopes of Hacheta Grande Mt.
there is a growth of very small scrub oak sometimes so close as to impede travel as it is mingled with a liroadleaved blackspined agave.
Elsewhere a small agave with white filaments is very abundant.
There is also an agave zone surrounding the mountains bounded outwardly by the zone of giant yuccas both usual on the slopes leading to the mountains in this part of New Mexico.
South of Daniels Peak the higher hills and buttes usually have Fouquieria and its characteristic society.
The rock is hard limestone worn into holes and points and containing few illpreserved fossils among which a Zaphrentislike coral crinoid stems and a spiral univalve are most abundant.
Rattlesnakes large centipedes tarantulas and small brovn scorpions are reasonably abundant.
Birds and mammals are scarce and owing to the absence of springs the mountains are not available for cattle range.
During the time we were there August 20 to 26 1910 the heat was intense from sunrise until after 9 P.M. Sky cloudless until midday when small clouds gather possibly covering 10 p. c. of the sky.
There was very little wind.
The annual rainfall is not known but must be less than 9 or 10 inches recorded from the region immediately northward.
Previous to the visit of Mr. L. E. Daniels and the writer in August 1910 the mollusks of these mountains had been collected by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns U. S. A. while serving on the survey of the Mexican boundary.
Dr. Mearns started from Mesquite or Mosquito Springs Chihuahua 6 or 8 miles east of the mouth of Sheridan Canyon.
Entering Thomson Canyon he turned southward to get a practicalile grade for mules up the steep ridge terminating in Daniels Peak.
Passing near or over the summit he camped at its north end.
From here his route lay along the ridge to the summit of Big Hachet Mt.
 thence eastward to near our Station 9 south past our Station 8 and back to camp as plotted on the map where his route is approximately indicated by small crosses. On this trip collections were made between camp and the first rise indicated on the map on the outjourney to the peak and somewhere between our Stations 9 and 8 on the return.
2 We would here acknowledge Dr. Mearns' kindness in plotting his route on our map and giving the above details of his visit.
From the data it is now easy to determine the type localities of the specias he found.

Dr. Mearns returned to Mesquite Springs along the ridge running from Daniels Mt.
towards our camp in Sheridan Canyon and along the wash ruiming out of this canyon.
Dr. Mearns found the following seven species which were determined by Dr. Wm.

Specimens reported from summit of Hacheta GTande  Or eohelix hachetana.
Epiphragfnophora hachitana Dall   Sonorella hachitana

Holospira crossei Dall.
Holospira hilamellata Dall.
Holospira mearnsi Dall.
The relationships of the Big Hachet fauna are closest with the Florida and Organ ranges.
Near related species of Sonorella and Ashmunella inhabit these three ranges and Sonorellas very close to hachitana have been found in the Carrazolillo and Peloncillo Mountains.
The Oreohelices stand nearest to Chiricahua species.
The Holospiras and Vallonia are special to the range but the other small shells are common to most mountains of southern Arizona.
Holospira is the most generally distributed snail in these mountains.
Its abstemious nature is evidently satisfied with the scanty moisture supplied by the rare rains and light snow which is said to whiten the mountains for brief periods in the winter.
No doubt a great many colonies and other local races of Holospira remain to be found.
Holospira lives only where there is limestone.
We never found but one colony on igneous rock and this was on a dyke in a limestone region.
They are usually found on the hot slopes east and south where other snails are totally absent or very rare.
The subgenus Radiocentrum of Oreohelix is represented by two new species making five now known.
The new forms agree in genitalia and sculpture of the embryonic shell with those already known.
In the large number examined no embryos were found so that there can be very little doubt that the species of this group  Diagnoses of new mollusks from the survey of the Mexican boundary Proc.

It is also a more primitive feature.

As this species is type of the genus Sonorella the investigation of its soft anatomy had become a matter of importance and to obtain living material was one of the chief objects of our quest in the Hachetas.
We found it at Stations 7 8 10 and 11.
All of these stations are near or on Dr. Mearns's route to the summit of Hacheta Grande.
Station 7 on the western slope of a hill at the head of the northern branch of Western Canyon was the most prolific locality.
Here the Sonorellas may be found in some numbers under large stones on the steep slope near the hilltop where there is some shade from the pinon pines.

u  u 21.3    10.8  5 Epiphragmophora hachitana Dall was originally designated as the type of Sonorella but the soft anatomy of the genus was described from New Mexican specimens of what was subsequent determined as a small form of S. ashumni Bartsch a species which at that time had not been discriminated from S. hachitana.
The dissection of topotjes of hachitana shows that the New Mexican form is specifically distinct though closely allied.
328 May At Station 5 two broken examples much weathered were dug out of the soil.
Though practically adult the largest measures only 18.2 mmdiameter the shell being quite as solid as in large individuals.
It was probably dwarfed by the arid conditions before it became extinct in this place.
The genitalia are remarkable for the small size of the male organs.
The penis is very slender diameter 1 mm. tapering downward and encircled at the base by a short sheath.
The penispapilla is very slender gradually tapering and annulate.
The retractor muscle is terminal long and slender.
Epiphallus a little shortei' than the penis.
The vagina is slightly longer than the penis.
Other organs as usual.
Measurements of the organs of two individuals are given in the following table with those of allied forms for comparison.

In my former work on S. hachitana 1905 I referred shells from the Organ and Florida Mountains and from central Arizona to S. hachitana which at that time was not known anatomicall3 While it must be admitted that the shells are very similar I find differential anatomical characters which though not great seem to be constant in a considerable number examined and which favor the more analytical treatment of the hachitana group effected by Dr. Bartsch a view I formerly opposed.
After examining many fresh specimen
from both ranges I separate the Florida and Hacheta Sonorellas subspecifically.
Whether the typical form of S. hachitana occurs outside of the Big Hachet range is doubtful.
The Peloncillo range Sonorella S. h. peloncillensis is not easily distinguishable by the shell alone but the proportions of the genitalia differ.
On the Carrizolillo Mts. top of two peaks near the boundary line numerous bones were collected by Dr. Mearns No.

It is apparently a small race of hachitana The locality is about 30 miles east of Big Hachet Mountain.
Specimens reported as S. hachitana from the Chiricahua Mountains will doubtless turn out to be one of the species already described from there.
Several resemble hachitani more or less in the shell but all differ in genitalia.

In another lot No.
130013 U. S. N. M. three specimens Hacheta Grande Mt. the parietal caUus is appressed.
This diiTerence in the parietal callus is exactly what we have noticed between the specimens from our Station 5 near Dr. Mearns's camp site and those from our Stations 10 and 11 near and at the top of Hacheta Grande Mt. a place also visited by Dr. Mearns.
We conclude therefore that there was a mistake of Huachuca for Hacheta in the label of No.
130012 and that A. mearnsii does not really live in the Huachucas.
This seems the more likely because in several camping trips to the Huachucas this species was not found.
A record of .4. mearnsi from the Organ Mountains N. M. has been published on the authority of Professor Cockerell.
We have not seen the specimen but suspect that they are A. kochi Clapp.
We suggest that our Station .5 in the Hacheta Mountains be accepted as type locality for .4. mearnsi.
330 May in great profusion at Station 5 on the east side of Daniels Mountain near the summit with Holospira bilamellata .
Also at Stations 7 10 and 11 the latter at the summit of Hacheta Grande.
The specimens from Station 5 not far from the site of Dr. Mearns's camp agree well with the original specimens description and figure.
Usually the parietal callus is raised from the surface as a thin straight lamina and in almost all of them the edge is more definite than in shells from other stations.
The axial end of the parietal lamella is abruptly bent towards the columella and is more or less tubercular Rarely the tubercle is almost free from the lamella.
The spire is occasionally almost fiat.
The color in shells taken alive is translucent sayal brown.
The diameter varies from 11.5 to 14.5 mm.
In specimens from the summit of Hacheta Grande the parietal lamellffi are a little shorter the axial end of the longer branch is often straight but more frequently is bent or the bend is represented by a tubercle connected with or almost free from the lamella.
The edge of the parietal callus is appressed to the surface and is often arcuate.
The aperture varies in obliquity as the figures show.
The penis is stout bipartite.
The epiphallus is strongly convoluted just beyond the insertion of the retractor muscle.
It is very long.
No flagellum seen.
The spermatheca is largest in the middle thinwalled.
Length of penis 4.5 mm.
 epiphallus 30 mm.
 vagina 4 mm.
 spermatheca and duct 19 mm.
A. mearnsi lives in the earth under stones like A. ivalkeri in the Floridas both being burrowing species.
It is closely related to A. kochi Clapp and A. walkeri Ferriss but quite distinct from both.
A. levettei bifurca in the Huachucas is a less depressed shell with more whorls.

Summit of Hacheta Grande Mountain at Station 11 collected August 25th 1910 by H. A. Pilsbry.
Also Station 10 Pilsbry and Daniels.
This species was collected in considerable quantity  several hundred living specimens.
The bones are seen all over the upper four or five hundred feet of the peak between Stations 10 and 11 of the map.
Living snails were all taken on the west side and were most abundant at the summit near and north of the small stone monument or cairn which marks the summit on and under stones.
Also on the precipitous western slope at Station 10.
The species is very uniform in all its characters.
The size varies from 14 to 16 mm.
diameter and in some shells the last whorl descends more than in others.
Very few have the parietal callus thickened and a little raised.
It differs from all forms of 0. strigosa by its convex radially costellate embryonic whorls but in many adult shells this sculpture is effaced.
0. ferrissi is probably the most nearly related species though very different.

Only a few longdead shells were found in this thirsty place where at the base of the cliffs there are a few small pinyon pines mostly dead or moribund.
Holospira and Ashmunella mearnsilive here in abundance.
A young shell long dead found at Station 6 may belong to the same variety.

Postembryonic whorls have the surface densely lamellose along growthlines the lamellae rising in triangular cuticular processes where they cross the spiral ridges of the shell.
When denuded the shell has a blunt projecting peripheral carina the upper surface has a wide somewhat angular spiral ridge upon all the postembryonic whorls sometimes with one or two minor ridges the lower surface has three to five low spiral ridges and some minute weak spiral striae the whole shell being closely threadstriate along growthlines.

0. ferrissi has much the appearance of the Chiricahuan 0. barbata Pils. but this resemblance is superficial.
When denuded of the cuticular fringes the two are quite different the Chiricahuan specie
being much smoother without the strong spiral ridges of 0. ferrissi.
Moreover the sculpture of the embryonic shell is different.
The shape of penis and epiphallus in 0. ferrissi is like 0. chiricahuana and 0. clappi both organs being enlarged distally while in 0. barbata the lower half of the penis is enlarged the distal portion slender.
In welldeveloped shells the last whorl scarcely descends anteriorly the upper margin of the lip being inserted on the peripheral carina.
In some of the smaller adults diam.
13 mm. the last whorl is bent downwards the upper and columellar margins of the lip converge and are connected by a raised parietal lamina the mouth having a somewhat triangular contour.
These are to be regarded as decadent gerontic individuals.

This small colony is probably extinct or nearly so as no living shells were found.
Our Station 3 is on ledges of high clifTs facing the mouth of Sheridan Canyon and especially on a bench about halfway up.
Here Ferriss's Oreohelix lives on an almost inaccessible cliff looking out over the mesa into Mexico.
There is little vegetation on the ledges.
On the talus slope below the cliff there is a growth of dwarf oak about kneehigh charming big wild roses of a species which we saw nowhere else Cylindropuntia Opuntia hisnagsis etc.
On top above the cliffs the Fouquieria sotol mescal society is found.
The Oreohelix colony is of small extent the ledges where they were observed living are probably not over a couple of square rods in area with perhaps an equal area on the talus below the cliffs where dead shells were found.
These estimates are from memory as I neglected to note the figures at the time.
The locality on the east side of Teocalli Butte is more restricted and if possible more arid.

Differs from 0. ferrissi by the more convex spire and by the weakness of the spiral sculpture there being no such pronounced spiral ridge on the upper surface of the whorls and only very weakly sketched spirals on the base whilst in 0. ferrissi these ridges are very emphatic.

Of large shells only Holospira and Ashmunella survive on this mountain both of them being burrowing animals.

Found at Stations 3 and 5.
It is an almost ubiquitous Lower Sonoran snail.
UROCOPTIDuE.
The study of a very large series of Hachita Holospiras has fully confirmed the results reached in our study of Chiricahuan species that the number of internal lamellse is variable in each species and colony among perfectly mature or even aged individuals.
They vary in a way it was impossible to foresee at the time when Holospiras were so rare that only one or two of a lot could be opened.
Very naturally the number of internal lamellse was thought at that time to be of specific and even subgeneric value.
In some colonies it appears that the largest shells have in the average the greatest development of lamellse so that it might be thought that only the most vigorous individuals attain the full number yet other races or colonies give a contrary result.
No external character is correllated with the number of lamellse.
Usually most of the shells of any one colony resemble each other in size shape and sculpture so that each lot has a certain individuality though all of the characters vary more than is usual among the land snails.
We have never found two species of Holospira living in one colony either in the Hachitas or in any other district in the course of several years collecting in many places in Texas New Mexico and Arizona.
A comparison of the Holospiras of the Hachita Grande range with those of the Chiricahua range shows some interesting resemblances and differences.
In both localities the internal lamellse present in almost every form known ly large lots may be 1 Superior axial and basal or 2 axial only.
In Hachita forms we have also the combination 3 axial and basal which is never found in the Chiricahuan series where it is replaced by the combination 4 superior and axial.
Every Hachita species has therefore in different specimens of the same colony the characters of the supposed subgenera or sections Bostrichocentrum Haplostemma Distomospira and Tristemma while a Chiricahuan species will belong to Bostrichocentrum  Eudistemma and Tristemma.
In external form and sculpture there are no differences greater than specific between the Hachita and Chiricahua species.
The Hachita Holospiras belong if we accept the criterion of intergradation to only one species for which the prior name is H. crossei.
Between this species and H. bilamellata there is a perfect series of intergrades in size sculpture and number of whorls.
We mean by this that some individuals of an H. crossei colony could not be distinguished from mearnsi some mearnsi can be exactly matched in a colony of hilamellaia or of media and certain slender shells of bilamellata would pass as longa.
The other named forms are more distinct probably because we did not happen to collect where th e intergrading colonies live.
The races are therefore based upon the forms dominant in each colony.
One might easily define a half dozen species if only a few shells from each place were in hand or if the internal lamellse were taken to be of specific weight it might be thought that there are between two and three times that number.
There are many colonies most of which have some special characters.
A thorough exploration of the northern end of the range will undoubtedly bring to light very many more forms so that any treatment of the group must now be tentative.
For our present purpose we consider the smallest form crossei and the largest bilamellata as species ranking the others as subspecies though in some cases they are more distinct than these two are from one another.
Several thousand shells were collected.
The colonies at Stations 1 2 3 12 are of very limited extent physical features restricting them.
Station 5 is much larger.
The other Stations 4 6 8 9 10 11 merely represent collecting points in large areas where Holospira may be picked up almost anywhere over considerable tracts while at the same time there are large areas in the region over which these stations are scattered where no shells can be found.

The species is distinguished from H. crossei chiefly by its greater size.
It was found by Mr. Daniels and the writer in great abundance at Station 5 on the east side of Daniels Mountain under the cliffs close to the summit with Ashmunella niearnsi and Oreohelix in the piiion zone.
In most of the shells the external ri

The pillarlike shape numerous whorls and prevalence of a superior lamella as well as the deeper position of the lamellae are individually variable characters yet in the aggregate they may suffice to define a race in this group.
These Holospiras live among rocks where there is very little xerophytic vegetation and the heat is terrific.
The type lot was picked up at about the same elevation as Station 5 but there the exposure is less calorific the sparse pinons and the cliffs afford shade so that the soil retains some moisture Holospiras were seen scattered over a large area below and around Station 4.

The upper partition was broken away in opening so that the presence of a superior lamella is uncertain.
This form stands nearest to H. b. mearnsi but the striation is sharper not partially effaced on the later whorls and the cone is in the average longer.
The habitats of mearnsi and media are rather remote from one another and several other forms inhabit territory between them.
The specimens from Station 12 are more like mearnsi the sculpture being weak on the penultimate and next earlier whorls.
Out of 11 opened  2 have one lamella axial.
9 have two lamellse axial and basal.
1 has three lamellse axial basal and superior.
Station 2 is on the northern slope of one of the ravines east of and running from Teocalli Butte at the foot of an irregular projecting bench of limestone.
It is much the lowest station where shells were found in the Hachetas.
The shells are partly as rough as those from Station 3 but some approach those of Station 12.
Out of 21 shells opened  15 have two lamellse axial and basal.
6 have three lamellse axial basal and superior.
In size the shells from Stations 12 and 2 are about equal to those from Station 3.

These shells connect H. crossei and H. bilamellata.
Specimens of intermediate size agree exactly with one of the type lot of mearnsi kindly lent from the National Museum.
The smallest shells are indistinguishable from crossei while the largest could not be separated from small hilamellata.
Yet the colony as a whole has a certain individuality by its intermediate size and as the form has been named we let it stand as a convenient place for crosseihUameUata intergrades.
It is attached to H. bilamellata rather than to H. crossei because the prevalent form in the small lot opened is bilamellate.
All of the shells were collected in one spot where the writer sat resting.
A large quantity could have been gathered had time and strength permitted.
A few specimens are quite finely striate while others are rather coarsely ribbed like the type of mearnsi still others being intermediate in sculpture.
The sculpture in some shells becomes very much weaker on the penultimate and next earlier whorls.
H. mearnsi served as monotype of the subgenus Haplostemma Dall characterized by the possession of an axial lamella only.
Bartsch opening another specimen found a basal lamella also and concluded that that lamella had been broken away in opening the original specimen.
Since some fully adult examples are known to have an axial lamella only it is likely that Ball's original diagnosis was correct for the specimen he opened while Bartsch was also right as to the shell he examined and which we have seen.

The writer collected H. crossei at the type locality the summit of Hacheta Grande.
The exact spot Station 11 is just off the western edge of the small level tract at the summit which is marked by a small stone monument.
Being much higher this station is less dry than Station 5 where the large H. bilamellata abounds and there is decidedly more vegetation.
A few were picked up on the slope towards Station 10 dead shells being scattered all over the upper 500 ft. or more of this ascent.

The embryonic shell of slightly over 2 whorls is smooth and projects nipplelike.
The following whorls of the cone are strongly ribbed but the ribs weaken more or less on the cylindrical part so that on the penultimate whorl they are often inconspicuous or almost wanting for brevity called smooth in the above tables.
There is of course complete intergradation in this character so that the classification in the table is more or less arbitrary.
The size averages larger in shells with 2 or 3 lamellae but there are exceptions.
It will be understood that the measurements were based upon shells which to all external appearance are adult or old.
After a careful study of the aperture and lip I think that it may be accepted as certain that the variations in lamellae recorded above are not dependent upon age of the individual.
At Station 10 on the northern slope of Hacheta Grande Mt. a small series was taken.
All of them have the whorls of the cylindric portion smooth or nearly so glossy the cone and the last whorl or its last half being ribbed as usual.

112012 A. N. S. P. collected by Pilsbry August 25 1910.
This species is abundant at Station 11 in the dirt under stones.
It is more closely related to V. perspectiva Sterki than to any other but it is a very much larger shell.
V. cydopherella has far finer striation.
V. gracilicosta has closer riblets and a much smaller umbilicus.
V. alhula has a smaller umbilicus.
Having collected and identified some thousands of the Vallonias of Arizona and New Mexico in the last ten years it was a surprise to find a species which differs conspicuously from the three mountain species mentioned above.
As we have not found V. sonorana elsewhere in our work in southern New Mexico and Arizona it seems likely that it is a southern species which Imrely crosses the international Ijoundary.
As a rule Vallonias are rather widely distributed snails.
The Holarctic genus Vallonia now comprises about 25 recent and pleistocene and a half dozen tertiary species besides about a dozen named varieties.
It is likely that some of these are mere synonyms.
We have nine recent species in the United States all of them readily recognizable except V. excentrica which is often hard to tell from pulchella.

The Florida Mountains.
The Florida range accent on the  is about twelve miles long with a maximum elevation slightlj' exceeding 7000 ft.
It runs from north to south.
A partially detached but adjacent continuation northward is knowai as the Little Floridas. 
As in neighboring ranges there is a long ascent or mesa before reaching the base of the mountains proper 5000 ft. characterized by a zone of tree yuccas.
The mountains are arid and rather iDarren of limestone in the middle towards the top granitic southward and porphyritic northward.
Vegetation scrubby.
We noted as common two small species of oak hackberry sotol cylindropuntia a broadleaved agave etc.
Barrel cactus bisnaga was seen at the foot.
In November 1906 Mr. Ferris and the author drove out from Deming 18 miles to Mr. Priser's cabin where there is a small spring in 1915.1 347 Spring Canyon.'
This is above the middle of the west side of the range.
The summit here projects as a limestone butte bomided by cliffs on the east north and west sides.
Access was gained to the top on the south side.
The flat summit is covered with grass Fouquieria Cylindropuntia and other cacti Agave etc.
No shells.
There is a fine outlook the jagged Organ Mountains silhouetted eastward.
Around the base of this central summit we found Ashmunella walkeri and Sonorella by digging in the soil among the rocks where there was shade.
We found only seven species of snails in all.
