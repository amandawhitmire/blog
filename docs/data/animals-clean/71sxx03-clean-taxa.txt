DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES BY JULIA A. GARDNER and T. H. ALDRICH The exact locality from which the mollusca listed in this paper were collected is known as the Muldrow Place Sumter County South Carolina and is located five miles southeast of jNIayesville.
The material is a blue clay marl twelve feet thick exposed on some small streams.
Normally it is overlaid by about twelve feet of sand and loam.
Earle Sloan listed it on p. 308 of his  Catalogue of the Mineral Localities of South Carolina and named it Upper Pee Dee Phase of the Miocene.
It seems to be very nearly of the same age as the Duplin beds farther north and contains a great number of the same species.
The fauna is more tropical in character than the Miocene of Maryland and Virginia.

Protoconch.
 Apex broken away in all available material.
Nucleus apparently small.
Sculpture. External 'sculpture vigorous both axial and spiral.

Type Locaii. Smithfield James River Isle of Wight County Virginia.
Yorktown Formation.
Observations.
 Drillia tricatenaria Conrad is more vigorously sculptured than any of its congeners even the closely related Drillia pyrenoides Conrad.
D. pyrenoides is furthermore a relatively shorter somewhat stouter shell than D. tricatenaria with a more rapidly tapering spire and a slightly shorter canal.
The axial costae of the former are much more nodose in character than in the latter while the spirals both primary and secondary are fewer in number more irregular and less prominent.
Upon the posterior fasciole the spiral sculpture is often altogether obsolete excepting for the sutural cord which is always less prominent than in D. tricatenaria.
Members of this species appear under such various names in the different collections that it has seemed worth while to redescribe and figure the type kindly loaned for the purpose by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

Observations.
 It seems quite probable that this late Miocene Drillia is the ancestor of the Caloosahatchie Pliocene form Drillia piscator Dall.
In general aspect it is a more highly polished shell with a less strongly defined sculpture.
In detail it differs from D. piscator in the nuclear characters the more numerous axial ribs which are more prominent especially on the ultima the narrower and more elevated spicals and the stronger and more angular liration revolving anterior to the suture.

Original Description.
 A single specimen too worn to name was found in the Caloosahatchie marl.
It has about sixteen ribs and in general resembles a slender M. Wandoensis but just below the periphery of the whorl is a marked groove channelled and cutting the ribs as well as the interspaces.
On the earlier whorls this channel revolves a short distance behind the suture which thus appears double.
This character will enable the species to be recognized when perfect specimens are found.
There are three folds on the columella and the shell is about the size of the next species.

Plate I flg.
10.
General Characters.
 Shell slender spire greatly elevated for the genus.
Aperture less than twothirds the total altitude.
Whorls closely appressed almost flat though apparently somewhat convex because of the greater prominence of the axial ribs near the median line of the whorl.
Body whorl gently rounded rather sharply constricted at the base.
Suture distinct not conspicuous gently undulated by the axial ribs of the preceding whorl.
Protoconch.
 Protoconchsmall smooth acutely tapering paucispiral although the exact number of turns can not be determined because of the decortication of the apex.
Sculpture. Axial sculpture of prominent rounded ribs and of incrementals visible only under magnification costse 7 or 8 to the whorl rounded though sharply defined conspicuous elevations which on the spire persist from suture to suture although strongest on the periphery body costse rounded on the summits the sides almost vertical gradually flattening as they approach the canal prominence of the costse greatly increased by the peculiar spiral lirations which cross them.
Primary spirals 3 or 4 in number upon the whorls of the spire broad and low and very flat in the intercostal areas and on the sides of the costse lirse abruptly thickening however upon the summits of the costals thereby throwing the intercostal areas into relief and apparently increasing the elevation of the costse secondary spiral lirations narrow flat bands less than onehalf as wide as the primaries and separated from them by interspaces the width of the former secondaries not increasing in prominence as they cross the axials posterior fasciole rather wide sculptured with an anterior secondary 2 or 3 primaries of uniform elevation and without intercalated secondaries together with a broad presutural ribbon equal to the primaries in altitude and exceeding them in breadth body whorl ornamented with 12 primaries secondaries intercalated on the posterior portion but absent anteriorly anterior fasciole differentiated but not prominently keeled sculptured with 5 to 8 crowded lirse.
Aperture.
 Aperture ovateelongate.
Labrum arcuate furnished with 8 or 9 sharp plications upon the surface.

Observations.
 Phos sloani is known only from Sumter County South Carolina and is quite unlike any described form.
It is characterized by the peculiar abrupt increase in the prominence of the spirals as they mount the summit of the costals so that the intercostals have the appearance of being smoothly scooped.
We have the pleasure of naming this interesting species in honor of Dr. Earle Sloan of Charleston South Carolina whose name will always be so pleasantly associated with the development of the Geological Survey of South Carolina.

Whorls 8 to 10 in number regularly increasing in size minutely tabulated posteriorly the preceding volution correspondingly undercut anteriorly.
Early whorls of conch strongly carinated the keel moving forward from its initial position at approximately the median horizontal till by the end of the first whorl it directly overhangs the suture and conspicuously coronates the succeeding turn gradually however becoming lower and less prominent and usually reduced to the normal plane of the spire by the end of the third whorl.

 Axial sculpture appearing as a rule on the first coil of the conch in the shape of faint incremental striae which rapidly strengthen and recur at more and more regular intervals until by the beginning of the second conchal whorl there is in the majority of individuals a well established axial sculpture of 16 to 18 narrow obtuse slightly arcuate riblets which are uniform in strength on the early whorls from the posterior shoulder to the anterior keel which they delicately crenulate axial sculpture varying in degree of development and persistence from that of the A. styliola sensu stricto to an almost smooth type in which the costals are reduced to feeble undulations faintly visible just posterior to the suture line and even feebler wavelets anterior to the suture.
Spiral sculpture confined as a rule to the base of the body whorl the pillar and the anterior canal periphery of ultima usually outlined by a shallow linear sulcus base of ultima usually sculptured with 6 to 8 low half obsolete threads separated by linear interspaces and in front of them 2 less feeble mor widely separated spirals lirations upon the pillar and anterior siphonal canal normally 9 or 10 in number well rounded rather prominent and closeset faint traces of spiral lirse visible under high magnification upon other portions of the surface but nowhere sufficiently strong to affect the general aspect of the shell.

Maximum diameter 6.1 mm.
Type Locality.
 Tilly's Lake South Carolina.
Waccamaw Formation.
Observations.
 The subspecies carolinensis is isolated from the communis s. s. by the absence of the minute tabulation in front of the suture and the longer and straighter anterior canal.
In many of the collections and checklists forms similar to those which have been included under this subspecies are listed under Astyris profundi or its subspecies minor and permagna.
The type of profundi was dredged in eight hundred and five fathoms.
The body whorl is more rounded than in any of the Tertiary individuals with which it is confusable the nucleus has more turns and furthermore there is a microscopically fine but very distinct and regular spiral sculpture developed on the earlier whorls of the conch which has never been perceptible on any of the fossil individuals.
It would be indeed remarkable to find in the Tertiary sands the representatives of a recent deep water species associated with limpets littorinas clams and other characteristic denizens of the littoral zone.
There is however no reliable evidence that we are in the face of any such phenomenon.
The type is in the Collections of the United States National Museum and has been listed as Astyris 'profundi var.
permagna.
As permagna has never been described nor figured the label name has been abandoned in order to avoid the confusion of applying so suggestive an adjective to a subspecies of approximately the same dimensions as the species sensu stricto.

 The only constant difference which separated Ccecum flemingi from Ccecum virginianum Meyer of the Yorktown Formation is the contraction of the anterior aperture.
No trace of this is discernible in any one of the many Yorktown individuals examined while on the other hand it is a diagnostic of every perfect adult from the Duplin and Waccamaw.
The Yorktown forms furthermore run a little larger and perhaps  Dall 1889 Bull.

Duplin Formation.
Observations.
 Turritella duplinensis bears a strong resemblance to the laterally compressed race of Turritella subannulata Heilprin.
It is doubtless closely related and may be a precursor.
It also suggests Turritella cequistriata Conrad in general outline and type of sculpture although the latter is keeled at the median line of the volution the lirations are broader more nearly equal in size and separated by linear interspaces.
In the single adult form in the U. S. National Museum Collection from the Cape Fear River the systems have broken down and the lirse are numerous equisized irregularly alternating and tending to concentrate on the anterior portion of the whorl.
This suggests the possible identity with Turritella carolinensis vaguely described and badly figured by Conrad in 1875.
 It is probable however that the latter is characterized by a relatively broader base and a consistently more uniform spiral sculpture.
Conrad's type is not available unfortunately and it seems unwise to attempt to establish definite relationships between two species one of which is so ill defined.

 Liotia major is much the largest of any of the Liotias recorded from the area under discussion though not so large as Liotia shacklefordensis Olsson the closely related Yorktown analogue.
L. major differs from the common coexistent L. gemma in the development of strong basal spirals and in the absence of a sutural channel and of any radial sculpture other than the incrementals.
L. shacklefordensis is higher relatively and differs in the details of the body sculpture.
The shell is well protected by an outer percellanous covering which in the best preserved individuals completely conceals the nacre within.
The weathered shells are so highly iridescent however that they are much more suggestive of Solariella than of Liotia.

Yorktown Formation.
Observations.
 Though Pandora prodromos does not occur at Mayesville the species has been described in this paper in order to bring out the close relationship which apparently exists between the Tertiary Pandoras of the East Coast and the Recent.
In the Recent the subgenus Clidiophora is represented south of the Hatteras axis by the delicate alate little form Pandora trilineata Say.
The northern analogue P. gouldiana Dall is larger heavier and rudely rectangular in outline.
The differences between the northern and the southern analogues have apparently been inherited from their Tertiary precursors Pandora tuomeyi new species of the Duplin and Waccamaw faunas and Pandora prodromos of the Yorktown.
P. prodromos is a little higher relatively than P. goiddiana Dall and the posterior margin is not so sharply constricted below the submarginal keel.
The dentition of the Tertiary species is very much heavier than that of the Recent.
The middle and posterior cardinals of the right valve and the anterior cardinal of the left are in P. gouldiana Dall compressed into little more than linear ridges while in P. prodromos they are decidedly heavy and robust.
P. prodromos is neither so large nor so heavy however as the coexistent P. crassidens Conrad there is no trace retained of the linear radial sculpture which characterizes crassidens and the dorsal portion of the anterior cardinal of the left valve is not expanded into a well defined flange as in Conrad's species.

Observations.
 Pandora tuomeyi has apparently been confused with the recent Pandora trilineata Say a rather smaller and relatively lower species more tapering in outline posteriorly.
The most fundamental difference lies however in the dentition.
In general the cardinals of the recent species are the more compressed the more produced and the more sharply cut.
In particular the inner surface of the right valve of the Tertiary form in front of the middle cardinal is not thickened but often feebly channelled the middle cardinal is hatchetshaped or rhomboidal and shorter than the elevated laminar tooth of P. trilineata the posterior cardinal is shorter heavier and less uniform in elevation and the inequality between the two right cardinals is much more marked in the fossil than in the recent species.
In the left valve the resilial pit in tuomeyi is broader and less produced and the cardinal upon its anterior margin shorter and less sharp the left cardinal in P. trilineata has strongly defined margins bears a flange upon the dorsal half of its inner surface and terminates ventrally near the dorsal end of the anterior adductor impression the anterior cardinal of tuomeyi on the other hand suggests much more strongly a kinship to the subgenus Kennerleyia its anterior limit is often illdefined and the hiatus between such a tooth and the incurved and calloused surface of the anterior margins of Kennerleyia is not great the cardinal in tuomeyi furthermore is not expanded dorsally into a flange and is placed forward so that its ventral termination is at the medial line of the adductor impression.
The young of Pandora carassidens Conrad while similar in dentition are relatively higher less alate heavier and less compact in shell texture and show a very much stronger tendency toward radial sculpture in the right valve.

Observations.
 Representatives of this species have formerly been included under Strigilla flexuosa Say.
Say's type is not available at present nor does he give a specific locality.
From a comparison of his description and the recent material in the reference collections in the National Museum it seems probable that the type comes from off the eastern coast of Florida or from the Bahamas.
These forms are more convex than Stngilla eutykta more inequilateral less rounded and shorter anteriorly and are sculptured posteriorly with a fine zigzag grooving instead of the elongated coneincone of the new species.
There is a considerable degree of variation among the recent forms but the characters hold constant for any one general localit3 In the shells from off the west coast of Florida the sculpture is approximately uniform over the entire valve.
It is possible that even among the recent faunas the species has not been sufficiently restricted.

Observations.
 Macoma carolinensis is the analogue in the Neogene south of the Hatteras axis of Macoma virginiana and its subspecies conradi north of the axis.
It is rather higher less flexuous and more nearly equilateral than either of the former both by reason of the more nearly central umbones and the greater similarity of the anterior and posterior extremities.
The posterior dorsal margin of M. carolinensis has a uniform fairly steep slope while that of M. virginiana is slightly contracted directl' behind the umbones then obliquely produced at a very low angle.
The posterior lateral margin of the former is rounded into the slightly upturned base that of the latter obscurely truncated and its ventral margin more strongly recurved.
The pallial sinus in both species varies quite widely but that of carolinensis is on the average more profound and more strongly arched beneath the umbones.
The species is rare in the Duplin and Waccamaw Formations of North and South Carolina.

Observations.
 In the unique valve which was selected as the type of Spisula magnoliana Dall the cardinal margin has been broken away and the edges so perfectly rounded by erosion that all traces of the characteristic ligamentary attachment of the Mulinia have been obliterated and replaced by a pseudeSpisuloid attachment.
This fact was established by the examination of fresh individuals in which the septum had been recently chipped away.
The subspecies is separated from the closely related protean congesta by the lower more regularly oval and elongate valves the less prominent umbones and the short rather heavy laterals.

The President John Cadwalader A.M. LL.D. in the Chair.
Thirtysix persons present.

Francis A. Cunningham.
The death of Raphael Blanchard a correspondent was also reported.
Oyster Farms of Delaware Bay.
 Dr. Pilsbry spoke of the ojster industry of Delaware Bay illustrating his remarks with photographs taken mainly on Maurice River New Jersey.
The processes of oyster cultivation were described.
In Maurice River Cove the beds are seeded from oysters dredged in deeper parts of the Bay but probably reproduction on the spot is the chief source of the supply.
On mud bottom a cultch of oyster shells is first scattered.This is not necessary on sand or gravel bottom.
The situation of these beds remote from any source of sewage insures a wholesome food supply free of pathologic bacteria.
The processes and apparatus of dredging freshening drinking and culling were shown by lantern illustrations.
In the autumn months the oysters cannot remain in the floats in which they absorb fresh water more than 24 hours.
At the time of the speaker's visit January about 400 schooners were in commission.
The subject was further discussed by the President who had long been interested in the development of this industry and by Dr. Henry Skinner.
The following was ordered to be printed.
