A STUDY OF THE SYSTEMATIC AND GEOGEAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE DECAPOD FAMILY ATYID Kingsley.
BY ARNOLD E. ORTMANN.
In the following paper I propose to give a revision of the family Atyidce with especial reference to its geographical distribution.
For a true representation of the geographical range of a group of animals it is necessary to examine the details of the distribution of all the known species as well as to define the systematic limits of each.
Every error in determining a species may be followed by great confusion difficult to solve by subsequent investigation.
In revising the known genera and species it is necessary to state the relations and affinities to each other in order to get an idea of the peculiarities of the geographical distribution and to find out their cause.
The family Atyidce although a small one comprises a considerable number of illdefined species and genera since most authors in creating such did not investigate their relations to those already known.
In the typical genus Atya there are farther difficulties due to the change of characters undergone by one species in the different stages of life which were wholly neglected by the majority of authors.
I have notwithstanding succeeded in revising the family pointing out the identity of certain species and genera defining some more correctly and stating the affinities so as to leave but a few species doubtful.
I have determined a peculiar geographical distribution of the family agreeing well with its habits and morphological characters.
The family Atyidce is a very characteristic one among the Decapod group of Eucyphidea.
It shows on the one hand a number of primitive characters on the other a very peculiar shape of the fingers of the chelae.
As I have stated in a former paper  the Atyidce are closely connected with the family AecintJiephyridce which live at great depths in the sea and contain without doubt the most primitive Eucyphidea.
The morphological differences between the two families are the following 1.
The mandible in the Acantliephyridce is furnished with a palpus synaphipod in the Atyidce it is wanting.
Decapoden u. Schizopoden der PlanktonExpedition 1893 p. 42.
2.
The fingers of the chelte in the Acanthephyridce are normal in shape in the Atyidte they are provided with a peculiar pencil of hairs.
I may add that the habits of the two families are wholly different the Acanthephyridce being true marine animals especially abyssal the Afyidce being true freshwater forms.
Among the Atyidce Kingsley distinguished two subfamilies Atyince and Ephyrime.
Since however there are but a few genera in this family a subdivision is needless.
The genera form a continuous series the transition being so gradual that it is difficult to define the limits of the two subfamilies.
In the following synopsis of the genera the first three named Xiphocaris Troglocaris and Atyaephyra may be regarded as belonging to the subfamily Ephxjrince as created by Kingsley the others as belonging to the Atyince.
Because the genus Ephyra from which is derived the name Ephyrince is a synonym this subfamily must be renamed and I propose to name it if at all Xiphocarmce.
The presence of exopodites on the pereiopoda of the Xiphocarhur the shape of the carpal and propodal joints of the first two pairs of pereiopoda and the shape of the rostrum constitute a very close resemblance to the Acanthephyridie.
Atyaephyra makes a transition to the Atyinw bearing exopodites only on the first two pairs of pereiopoda and having the carpal joints of these legs excavated at the distal extremity.
This excavation is very characteristic in the true Atyince but in Caridina the carpal joint only of the first pair of legs shows this peculiarity that of the second pair being normal.
Atyoida is intermediate between Caridina and Aiya in the shape of the propodal joints of these legs.
Within the limits of Caridina occurs a reduction of the form of the rostrum being in the Xiphocarinm long and serrated which in most species of Caridina is longer or shorter and serrated in a few very short and not serrated.
In Atyoida and Atija the rostrum is usually short but now and then it bears a few teeth on the inferior margin.
Thus the series formed by Xiphocaris Atyaephyra Caridina Atyoida and Atya is a continuous one whilst the genus Troglocaris is closely allied to Xiphocaris differing only by the rudimentary condition of the eyes due to its subterranean habits in cavewaters.
The genus Atya is the most extreme of the family.
The adult males of the species of this genus attain a considerable size and the third pereiopoda undergo with increase of age a change in shape.
the surface of the body and legs bearing a peculiar sculpture.
The most extreme species Atija erassa may be separated from the others according to the sculpture of the body and placed in a separate subgenus Evatya.
Fossil Atyidw are not known although A. MilneEdwards describes a Caridina nitida from the raarnes d'AixenProvence upper eocene or lower oligocene.
None of the arguments given by him prove that this fossil is a Caridina.
The presence in a freshwater deposit makes it probable that it belongs to Atyldoi but for the same reason Homelys minor of Meyer  from the freshwater deposits of the upper miocene of Qiningen would belong to the same family.

Atyoida the hands are formed like those of Caridina the dactylus movable finger is inserted on the upper margin of the propodus being shorter than the latter and forming a chela as usual in the Deeapoda consisting of a palmar portion and two fingers.
In Atya on the contrary the dactylus articulates with the propodus on the posterior end of the latter both joints being exactly alike and forming a hand of a very peculiar shape among the Deeapoda the palmar portion being wholly reduced and the hand consisting only of two fingers about alike in size and connected with each other at the posterior ends.

Considerations concerning the geographical distribution of the AtyidB.
Some species of Attjidce.
were formerly considered to be marine animals there is now no doubt that this family contains only freshwater forms.
This family is probably one of the most primitive groups of Decapoda living in freshwater having immigrated at an early geological period.
Only two species Caridina tvycki and gracilirostris are recorded by Weber as found in a few cases in brackish waters of Sumatra 18 This locality is not yet published  there is one adult male fromTobago in the museum at Strassburg.

Eeise Niederl.
Ost.Indien. II 1892 p. 542. aud Celebes. I believe that this occurrenceniay be considered as a readaptation of these two species as they are found also in freshwater.
Since the genus Caridina is not a primitive one while the genera of the Xiphocarince are so and live exclusively in freshwater it is very probable that the freshwater habit of the family must be regarded as the original manner of living.
I believe therefore that the Atyidce even of the Indian Archipelago are not immigrants from the sea as stated by Weber 1. c.  p. 543 but true localized freshwater animals forming an old element of the freshwater fauna.
 The main differences of the Atyidce and their supposed ancestors the Acanthephyridce are morphological as well as biological the Acanthephyridfe being true marine and essentially abyssal animals.
To all appearance the morphological differences are causally connected with the change of habits.
The peculiar pencil of hairs at the distal extremities of the fingers is adapted for securing the special food required as described by F. Miiller in Atyoida potimirim. No doubt the other species of Atyidce feed in the same manner.
I cannot say whether the absence of the synaphipod of the mandible is due to the same cause since the function of the synaphipod is unknown but it may be in connection with it.
On the other hand the habits of the Acanthephyridce are wholly unknown so that we cannot compare this family with the Atyidce but it is very probable that the morphological differences of the Acanthephyridce correspond to differences in the habits especially in securing food.
We can state briefly that the Atyidce are closely allied to the most primitive Eucyphidea forming a peculiar branch of development very early separated from the main stem now represented by the Acanthephyridce.
Their several characters are connected with a change of habit and with the immigration to freshwaters.
The geographical range of the Atyida embraces the whole of the circumtropical parts of the world members of the family being recorded from all the localities explored within these limits.
Only in two localities does the range exceed the true tropics  in Japan where it extends as far north as Tokio and in the Mediterranean province 0 See de Man ibid. pp.
387 399 400.
21 Weber 1. c p. 533 echte regionale imd locale Siisswasserticre die einen alten Bestand der Siisswasser Fauua bilden.
22 Kosmos IX 1881 p. 117 ff.
where it extends northward to southern France and southern Austria.
This nearly exclusive distribution within the tropics at least in the warmer climates shows that the family was probably also in former times an inhabitant of the warmer parts of the world and the possibility is granted that the immigration into freshwater took place at a time when climatic zones were not at all differentiated a tropical climate prevailing everywhere.
If this immigration took place in a later time the poles having undergone a cooling one could not understand the presence of the family in all parts of the tropics as well as the occurrence of some genera Xiphocaris Carldina Atya on both of the present great continents the eastern and western.
After the cooling of the northern and southern circumpolar regions the range of the family was divided into two parts  an eastern comprising the tropical Africa Asia Australia and the Pacific islands and a western comprising tropical America. The most primitive genera of the family were restricted in range by the concurrence of the more extremely developed ones and the latter preserved a more circuratropical distribution.
It is very interesting to examine the geographical range of the genera and species from the point of view here given.
The most primitive genus Xiphocaris shows a distribution the peculiarity of which can only be understood by supposing that the range of this genus was formerly a more extended one but that in most parts of the world the representatives were exterminated.
Only three species survived one of which lives now in the freshwaters oi the West Indies the other in IndoMalaysia from Japan to Australia and the third in New Zealand.
From the intermediate countries species of this genus are not recorded.
The IndoMalaysian species Xiphocaris compressa repeats as we know at present this peculiarity in a reduced manner being only recorded from Japan the island of 23 See Ortmanii Jenaische Deukschr. VIII.
1894 p. 74 and Pfeller Versuch libeT die erdgeschiclitliche Eutwickelung der jetzigen Verbreitungsverhaltnisse uuseres Thierwelt.
Hamburg 1891.
 la case the Atyida immigrated from the sea into the fresliwater after this separation it is very probale that the geographical distribution would not be a circumtropical one but that different groups immigrated into the western and eastern continents.
We know another group of Decapoda in which the latter is the case  the family Telphusidxe one subfamily of which the TelphusincB being restricted to the tropical and subtropical parts'of the eastern continents Mediterranean African Indian IndoMalaysian etc.
 two other subfamilies Trichodactylince and Pseudotelphusince being restricted to the tropical parts of America.
Adenare and from Queensland.' The closely allied genus Troglocaris the only species of which might be regarded as a fourth form of Xiphocaris lives in the subterranean waters of Carniola a perfectly isolated locality in no way connected with the others named.
The third primitive genus Atyacplujra is found near the locality of Troglocaris on the northern borders of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is somewhat less primitive.
The scattered localities at which are found the species of these three genera forming the subfamily Xiphocarince are no doubt the remains of a more universal distribution in former times  the species now living show the character of true survivals.
In the subfamily Atyince the genus Atyoida shows a survival character similar to that of the Xiphocarince  being recorded from the Sandch Islands Tahiti and southern Brazil.
But this genus must be the subject of farther study.
The genus Caridina appears to be nearly a circumtropical one.
Its range is divided into two very unequal parts  the one comprising the West Indies and containing only one species the other comprising a continuous area of the old world and containing at least nineteen other species.
This area extends from South Africa along the east coast to the southern borders of the Mediterranean Sea and to Persia crossing the islands of the Indian Ocean and IndoMalaysia to Japan and Australia. Species of this genus have not yet been found in West Africa in southern Asia except Ceylon and Siam and in the Pacific islands but it may be that some species will be discovered later in these countries.
This distribution of the genus can only be understood by supposing that it was present before a separation of the eastern and western parts of the tropics took place and that the extended range of former times is now restricted to the tropical parts of the continents bordering the Indian Ocean and to its islands and to the islands of eastern Asia from Japan to Australia.
The occurrence of one species in the Nile and in the rivers of Algiers is due I believe to a more recent immigration from the central and eastern parts of Africa not unlike the occurrence of Pakemon nitolicus.
25 It may he that this species will he found on other islands between Asia and Australia but it is very remarkable that the large collections of freshwater Crustacea made by M. Weber in the Indian Archipelago and described by de Man do not contain this species.
6 A poorly descrilied species is recorded from the Cape Verde Islands.
2' See Ortmann Zoolog.
Jahrb. V 1891 p. 745.
It is very probable that farther investigations will prove that the range of Caridina is a somewhat different one since freshwater Crustacea of smaller size are mostly neglected by collectors and the fauna of the freshwaters of most tropical countries are very little known.
Accordingly the view given above on the geographical distribution of Caridina may perhaps have to be changed later.
The distribution of the most extreme genus of the family Atya is somewhat similar to that of Caridina.
It is found like the latter in the West Indies and IndoMalaysia but there are some modifications.
One species is known from West Africa which is identical with another described from the Orinoco and there is recorded one species from the Cape Verde Island identical with the common West Indian form.
The presence of identical freshwater species both in the West Indies and in West Africa is a very remarkable fact but not an isolated one among the Decapoda.
We know another group of freshwater Crustacea which shows the same peculiarity.
Of the genus Pakemon there are three species described from West Africa two of which.

' In Atya the identity of species of both continents bordering the Atlantic is due no doubt to other reasons than in Pakemon the latter being a very recent genus having immigrated to the freshwaters quite recently while some species are now immigrating from the sea to brackish and freshwater.
On the contrary the immigration to freshwater of the ancestors of Atya took place a long time ago and I think this fact indicates a former connection of Africa and America.
The other range of the genus Atya extends over the islands of the Pacific from Sumatra to the Saraoan islands.
None is recorded from southern Asia from the islands of the Indian Ocean or from East Africa.
The two species described by A. MilneEdwards from New Caledonia A. margaritacea and robusta are very doubtful as I have stated above.
I do not know another example of a freshwater  See Ortmann ibid. p. 747.
 Palcrmoii voUcnhovcni is certainly the same as Pal.
jamaiceusis in the paper quoted I supposed them to be nearly allied but distinct species.
2 Only Hilgendorf v. d. Decken's Eeisen III 1 1869 p. 101 records a very doubtful species from the Seychelles belonging perhaps to Atyoida.
Decapod iestricted to New Caledonia.
Our present knowledge of the freshwater fauna of the Pacific islands leaves it very improbable that New Caledonia has an isolated fauna differing from that of the other islands.
It is probable on the contrary that species found in New Caledonia will be found also in other islands but since A. MilueEdwards in 1864 described these two species they have never been recorded from any place in the Pacific.
It may be added that the differences of these species from the West Indian A. sccibra given by A. MilneEdwards are scarcely at all present.
I am therefore induced to suppose that both are erroneously recorded from New Caledonia the true locality being the West Indies and that they are identical with .4. scabra.
If these considerations are correct the genus Atya can be divided into two groups the one containing the species bearing on each side of the rostrum at the base a spiniform angle the other containing the species without a spiniform angle.
To the first belong the species A. scabra gabonensis and crassa their range extending over tropical America and West Africa to the second belong A. moluceensis spinipes and brevirostris the range of which comprises the IndoMalaysian and Pacific islands.
The last named species brevirostris forms a transition from the second group to the first.
Then the range of the genus Atya would be divided into two parts each containing a separate group of the genus and this peculiarity could be explained by supposing that these two groups may be developed separately from each other after the separation of the former connecting range of the genus.
This conjecture agrees with the fact that Atya is the most extreme genus of Atyidce and with its supposed recent age.
We know that some freshwater animals are rapidly distributed over great distances either in the adult or in the larval state but in the Atyidce we know nothing of the means of distribution.
Comparing the other Crustacean Decapoda we may say that the Atyidce have not been transported to great distances.
Nor is it probable that the eggs can endure a long time without water or that the larvse or the adult animals can leave the water for any length of time.
Transportation of the species of Atjida in either the active or passive state from one freshwater system to another over the land or through the air cannot be supposed at least over great distances.
Neither can the Atyidce live in the sea so that the most important topographical barriers to distribution would be widely extending oceans and large tracts of land without freshwater.
The Pacific Ocean forms a barrier of the first kind while the second may be partly connected with the climatic conditions of the warmer parts of the world.
Smaller areas of sea and land however may be crossed by some forms as is shown especially in the distribution of some species of Caridina and Atya.
The means of distribution are certainly very limited and therefore a great number of species are confined to very narrow districts.
Lastly the ancient character of the family induces me to suppose that there are also bionomic barriers the Atyidce not being able to immigrate to localities occupied by other freshwater animals better equipped for the struggle for existance.
I regret very much that exact observations on the habits of the species of Atyidce on the biology and bionomy are wholly absent.
It is very probable that the different genera and species on farther examination will show some differences especially that the best developed are more resistant to external influences.
The conditions of geographical distribution of the Atyidce are as follows   1.
The 4.yiice cannot endure cooler climates.
Climatic barriers.
2.
They are true freshwater animals.
Oceans and tracts of land without water form tajjogmphic barriers. 
3.
Being animals of an ancient type they are probably restricted by the occurrence of other freshwater animals.
Bionomic barriers.
4.
The faculties of distribution are very limited.
The Atyidce.
are therefore confined to the freshwaters of the tropics and subtropics the distribution of the genera and species especially of the more primitive ones shows a remarkable character of survival.
Only Caridina and Atya are of a more recent character extending over continuous areas within the tropics.
Because of the antiquity of the family it has no relations among the recent forms of the litoral regions of the tropical seas.'  Caridina fvpus ivycki nilotica  Atya scahra moluccensis spinipes.
3' Such relations to the Atlantic ItidoPacific and WesternAmerican regions see Ortnaanu .Tenaische Denkschr. VIII 1894 p. 76 are not at all evident none of the wellknown genera or species being limited by the borders of one of these regions.

Lulu Island mouth of Frazer River British Columbia May 31st 1892.
Col. by S. X. E. Description.
 Size large equalling Zapiis princeps from Colorado hut with a shorter foot.
Colors above as in princeps but darker the yellowishgray suffusion on back and sides of that species being replaced in trinotatus by brownishfulvous  the cheeks ears upper head circumocular region and upper surface of tail much blacker.
The upper surface of wrist is black with fulvous anterior edging reaching to foot.
Lateral stripe separating upper and lower body colors dark fulvous narrow and reaching from hams to and around front of fore legs and nearly meeting across throat.
The throat chin belly vent and lower inner surfaces of legs are a clear soft white.
In the center of lower throat and on each side of the sternum is a welldefined spot of fulvous about 8 mm.
long and 3 ram.
wide the pectoral spots being the larger and more strongly colored.
The fulvous of these spots does not reach base of hairs their roots being white as in the hairs of the fulvous lateral stripe.
Skull differing from any described form in its great relative width and depth to length the zygomse being more flaring the parietals more convex the incisive foramina larger and broader posteriorly the postpalatal notch more acuminate and indenting the palatal bones as far as m. 2.
The upper premolar is larger than in princeps or hiidsonius its crown rising to the grinding plane of the true molars and becoming functional bearing on its inner and posterior rim a crescentine loop partially enclosing a central cusp whose base lies on the outer anterior angle of the crown.
In princeps its nearest ally this tooth is not functional or rarely so its apex falling below the grinding plane and as in kudsonius consisting of a simple peglike process with the folding being more or less obsolete.
The lower molars of trinotatus are relatively larger than iu princeps or kudsonius the posterior loop of m. 1 and the second and last loops of m. 2 projecting exteriorly beyond the outer edges of their intervening loops forming a very irregular outline not seen in the latter species.
In trinotatus the inferior m. 8 is relatively large oneaudahalf times as long as wide and made up of a more complicated series of loops than in the same tooth of its allies.
The coronoid process is much lengthened wide across base blunt and distinctly notched at tip.
The angular process of mandible is perforated by a single minute foramen in the other forms it is multi perforate or incised by two conspicuous oblique slits.
Measurements of IP in millimeters.
 Total length 234 tail vertebrae 139 hind foot 32.
Topotype length 235 tail 142 foot 32.
Skull  Total length 24 basilar length 17.5 zygomatic width 13 nasal length 9.8 interorbital constriction 4.8 height of cranium 9.8 length of mandible 12.5 width of mandible 6.8.
Two males of this species were taken at Lulu Island.
Another from Mason Co. Washington is referable to it.
Zapus trinotatus is the West Cascade representative of Z. princeps.
Several specimens of jumping mice taken at Lac La Hache B. C.  and at Vernon in the same province are referable to princeps whose range will probably be found to be limited to the East Cascade and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States and of southern British America.
It is probable that the range of hudsonius will be found to reach far to the west in northern British America.
I am indebted to Mr. G. S. Miller Jr.  for the loan of specimens of Z. princeps for this study.
