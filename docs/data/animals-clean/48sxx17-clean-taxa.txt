NEW AND INTERESTING EOCENE Mollusca FROM THE GULF STATES.
BY GILBERT D. HARRIS.
The following new or interesting fossils belonging to the Lea Memorial Collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia have been put into ray hands for description and illustration by Rev.
L. T. Chamberlain of New York City.
The greater part of them were collected by Mr. Q. W. Johnson during the summers of 1894 and 1895.
They are not all new species  but many are in such an excellent state of preservation that it has seemed worth while to have them figured by the skilled penartist Dr. J. C. McConnell of Washington B.C.

This fine species is the Jackson representative of L. opidenta Con.
of the Claiborne sand.
It differs however from that species a in having finer rounder and not depressed concentric strise  b in having directly below the umbo a peculiar straight ventral margin for some distance c in being less nasiite posteriorly and d in having the concentric lines on the postumbonal slope less strongly marked and less distinctly interrupted and deflected by a radiating depression.

1 and the young of these two forms sometimes approach each other closely in outline yet there is always noticeable in pearlensis a tendency to become elongate like M. Icevigata of the Paris Basin.
Instead of making this a new species we might speak of it as a marked variety of aldricJii which itself is a variety of perovata Con.
It seems to us however better to designate it by a new name.
A variety of this species shows concentric liroe over its entire outer surface.

Several specimens of this species of a moderate size and rather imperfect are among the Jackson material of this collection.
A specimen perhaps the adult of this species is shown by fig.

XVIII.
The humeral carina instead of being simply finely crenulate is regularly nodular  moreover there are thin strong revolving ribs on the part of the whorl below the carina.
It is quite possible this should be regarded as a distinct species yet it is unsafe to propose a new name until more material is at hand.

The Lea Memorial Collection possesses a least one perfect specimen.
Hence in continuation of Aldrich's description it may be said  aperture slightly exceeding the spire in length  from the dentate carina downward on the body whorl to the end of the canal there are many granular spiral lines from the dentate carina toward the suture above two coarse granular spiral lines are found  inside of these spirals the humeral zone is smooth save faint traces of deeply curved longitudinal lines the retral curvature is confined to this smooth zone.

This species was described from a young specimen found in southern Arkansas.
Fragments of larger specimens were found by the writer at White Bluff on Arkansas River and still others in the Jackson beds of Mississippi.
This is by far the most perfect large specimen yet known.
Its close relationship to Fulgur must be evident to all.

There is great confusion among the Claiborne species of Fxmi8 and its allies and here is a most typical example.
Papillina stomiiea is quite fulgurate in appearance having a row of compressed tubercles on the carina and a long beak.
The specimens herewith figured show how greatly these features vary.
These specimens have some parts in common with F. irrasus Cob. and we are inclined to think all will prove to be one and the same species.
The apices of this and related species are smooth and blunt.

Conrad remarks that it is rare at Claiborne.
It is certainly so in a perfect state of preservation but portions of its huge columella are quite common in some places.

This is probably a variety of the form described by Conrad as P. lene or P. virginiana  but since we have no specimens of that species it is impossible to speak with certainty on the subject.
Several species of this genus have been described from the Eocene and it will be a serious matter to properly work out their synonymy.
This form differs from nieolletti by its smaller umbones and smaller size.

The fine large specimens in the Lea Memorial Collection differ somewhat from typical vaughani as found in the lower Claiborne beds of Texas.
The latter is smaller less strongly costate with lirse within the labrum.
The upper carinal spiral whorl is slightly higher in this variety than in the type.

In this collection there are specimens of various sizes and they show one marked peculiarity.
When small and young the anterior canal is long but curved  afterwards it seems to grow no more in length but becomes extremely bent or twisted and a large umbilicus is formed.

Labrum lirate within  columella very much twisted and showing signs of plications especially at the basal angle.
Umbilicus not large but well defined.
The most peculiar feature of this species is the imbricate appearance of the incremental lines.
This strongly reminds one of some of the Muricidse.
The general form of the species is much like Latirus rugatus Dall from the Ballast Point Silex beds.

While working over a large amount of material from the uppermost Midway limestone as exposed on the Chattahoochee several fragments of N. mediavia were found of the size indicated by the figure of the type in Bulletin 4.
It was soon found that fragments too indicated a considerably larger size for some specimens as found H miles northeast of Clayton.
Fragments of the body whorl of what would seem to be the same species occur at Matthew's Landing.
They certainly belong to the species herewith figured.
Hence it is quite probable that this larger specimen much compressed vertically belongs to the same species as the smaller specimen figured in Bulletin No.

483 October 6 The President Samuel G. Dixon M. D in the Chair.
Forty persons present.
The Committee on the Hayden Memorial Award reported in favor of conferring the recognition for 1896 on Professor Giovanni Capellini of Bologna.
Giovanni Capellini was born in Spezia August 23 1833.
He studied in the college of his native city and in the University of Pisa.
While yet a student he had made important paleontological discoveries and was in correspondence with illustrious scientists both Italian and foreign.
After obtaining his degree in science he made frequent trips in France England Switzerland Belgium and Germany.
In September 1859 he was appointed Professor of Natural History in the National College of Genoa.
In September of the following year he was made Professor of Geology and Paleontology in the University of Bologna.
In 1863 he visited North America.
The rich collections then made by him in Nebraska and elsewhere are now in the Geological Institute of Bologna.
In 1864 he made interesting scientific discoveries in the petroleum lands of Wallachia.
As President of the Second Extraordinary Reunion of the Italian Naturalists in Spezia in 1865 he founded the International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archeology.
In 1872 he travelled in Greece and in the autumn took an important part in the International Anthropological Congresses in Brussels.
He then travelled in Switzerland Holland Austria Hungary Germany Spain and Portugal and returned through France and England.
He was made VicePresident of the First International Geological Congress in Paris in 1878 and obtained its assent that the second meeting should take place in Bologna in 1881.
Elected actual President in conjunction with Quintino Sella as honorary President of this Congress he inaugurated the commission for the unification of geological nomenclature and a commission for the production of a geological map of Europe outlined at Berlin.
Together with Sella he founded on that occasion the Italian Geologi32 cal Society.
In 1885 he directed in great part the Third International Geological Congress in Berlin and contributed not a little to its success as also to that of the Fourth Session in London in 1888.
He had now published 140 scientific communications.
Having served as Rector of the University of Bologna at intervals from 1874 to 1888 in the latter year he organized and directed a celebration of its Eighth Century for which he received letters of congratulation from all the universities of the world.
He has been decorated by the Emperor of Germany and other sovereigns.
The University of Edinburgh conferred upon him through its Rector the diploma of Doctor  Honoris Causa.
The University of Moscow nominated him honorary Professor.
Seventy of the principal academies of Europe and America have registered his name among their members.
He was elected a Correspondent of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia in 1863.
He is President of the International Commission for the Unification of Geological Nomenclature and President of the Royal Geological Survey of Italy.
Mica Schists of the Schuylkill River.
 Theodore D. Rand presented specimens of mica schist from the river road near Strawberry Mansion Fairmount Park.
The nodules resemble very imperfect andalusite crystals but appear to be almost wholly quartz with a little kyanite or sillimanite resembling closely those described by the late Dr. George H. Williams in the Fifteenth Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey p. 665 as occurring on Sligo Branch probably Fairfax Co. Va. and as suggesting contact metamorphism of included fragments.

The Occurrence of Macaciis leoninus Blyth in Eastern Burmah.
 Arthur Erwin Brown stated that a young male moukey nearly allied to Maeacus nemestrinus was purchased by the Zoological Society of Philadelphia iu April 1894 from a person who had procured it at Mongnai in the southern Shan states Upper Burmah.
At the time this animal was received certain peculiarities led him to refer it provisionally to M. leoyiimis Blyth but it is only lately that he had fully determined this identification to be correct.
It has now lived in the garden two years and a half and he would suppose it to be about four years old but it has not yet assumed the full colors of the male of this species as shown in Mr. Sclater's plate' the resemblance between it and the female being still close.
The general color is pale brown resulting from the yellow and brown annulation of the hairs  the sides of the body and outside of the limbs are rather paler and somewhat grayish  the horseshoe mark on top of the head is well defined in a darker shade of brown which shows also along the back and upper side of the tail and slightly appears on the back of the hands and feet.
The characteristic red line in the bare skin from the outer corner of the eye is well marked and it is interesting to observe that it becomes much brighter in color when the animal is excited than at other times.
It is doubtful if this mark would be at all evident in skins.
The specimen is now about twenty inches in length from nose to base of tail  the tail being about six and a half and without a tuft.
As compared with nemestrinus of like age leoninus has the muzzle shorter the superciliary ridges more prominent the ischial callosities smaller the hair about the cheeks neck and shoulders much longer the spreading whiskers being conspicuous when looked at from in front the face and ears are paler and the iris is distinctly hazel brown while in nemestrinus it is of a paler yellowishbrown.
It would appear that M. leoninushas heretofore been only known to occur in the Province of Arracan in Western Burmah on the Bay of Bengal and from a few localities in the Valley of the Irrawaddy the present specimen therefore extends the range of the species eastward across Upper Burmah to the borders of Yunnan.
Dr. Griggs from whom the specimen was procured fully assured the speaker as to the locality.
The characters of this monkey are very distinct and at its present age when placed side by side with specimens of the southern form of pigtailed monkey M. nemestrinus there is no possibility of confusing them.
