CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ICHTHYOLOGY OF THE TROPICAL PACIFIC.
BY HENRY W. FO'U'LER.
 I.
The Sandwich Islands.
Among the more important collections of fishes presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia during the earlier days of its existence was one made by the celebrated naturalist and traveller Dr. John K. Townsend in the tropical Pacific.
In the year 1834 it seems that an expedition was formed under the auspices of a Captain Wyeth who intended to travel over the United States to establish trading posts along the Pacific coast.
Dr. Townsend joined the expedition at the suggestion of Mr. Thomas Nuttall the distinguished botanist who was also a member of the party.
After proceeding to Fort Vancouver they embarked for the Sandwich Islands arriving in Honolulu January 5th 1835 and after visiting the various islands returned to the Columbia river in April.
On the first of October 1835 IS'uttall left Townsend who remained in the West till November 1836 when he again left the Columbia for the Sandwich Islands making Oahu iu December and after making a pecoud tour of the islands he proceeded to Tahiti.
For detailed information concerning the route reference should be made to the account which he published in 1839 entitled  Narrative of a Journey across the Rocky Mountains to the Columbia River and a visit to the Sandwich Islands Chili etc.
Subsequently Dr. William H. Jones of the United States Navy was enabled to make collections in various branches of zoology while in the tropical Pacific among which was one of fishes which has found its way into the Academy.
Dr. Benjamin Sharp who visited the Sandwich Islands in 1893 made collections mostly of invertebrates among which was a small collection of fishes which he purchased in the markets of Honolulu during October or November.
All the specimens are alcoholic except a number in the Townsend and Nuttall collections which are dry preparations.

Type.
The form of the body is elongate and compressed and resembles tnat of the preceding species.
Mouth closing but when closed the lips do not conceal the sliarp teeth completely as some of these are always visible laterally lateral teeth of the upper jaw in 2 rows till posterior to the eyes at least those in the inner row somewhat the larger and occasionally a cauiuelike form is assumed  about 9 large fanglike teeth in the anterior portion of the upper jaw which has but 1 row of bordering teeth the teeth in the lower jaw in 2 rows which are close together and rather irregular this is the case in the upper jaw directly below the eye and there are also enlarged fanglike teeth in the anterior part of the mandible like those above vomerine teeth in a single series the median being slightly larger than the others.
The neck has the swollen appearance of most of the Morays and is thicker than the body.
The branchial apertures which are very small inconspicuous and which might easily be overlooked have the cleft of the mouth contained in the space between themselves and the tip of the snout about 3 times.
The eyes are rather large contained in the snout more than once their diameter situated laterally directly above the jaws and nearly midway between the tip of the snout and the corners of the mouth.
The anterior nostrils are placed in fleshy tubes the posterior pair are situated in the antero interorbital space and midway between the eyes and the tip of the snout are also a pair of nostrillike pores.
The depth of the head in the ocular region is greater than its width in the same region its general shape is moderately attenuated and compressed laterally.
The interorbital space is about equal to the diameter of the eye and is nearly level.
The D whose origin is at a point anterior to the branchial aperture though not median in position in the space between the latter point and the corner of the mouth is of moderate height and like the A. is continuous with the caudal.
The P. are absent.
The vent is situated about an eyediameter in advance of the origin of Ihe A Lateral line absent.
The general color of the body is a dark rich brown variegated with about 4 rows of longitudinal whitish spots all of which are not larger than the pupil of the eye.
The space intervening between the whitish spots is marked with blackish blotches of a similar size as the white ones but not so sharply defined.

Form of the body elongate strongly compressed the greatest depth contained in the total without the beak and caudal 7i to 7 times and the head including the beak is contained in the entire length of the fish not 3 times.
The greatest depth of the head which is in the occipital region is about  its length without the beak and the latter equals about f the length of the projecting beak.
The eye is situated in the upper anterior part of the head and is contained in the space between its anterior margin and the tip of the upper jaw 1 times in the length of the head from the latter point to the margin of the opercles 4 times in the greatest depth of the head about twice and once in the flat interorbital space.
In all these measurements of the eye the eye is measured horizontally as its shape is that of a somewhat contracted ellipse and the pupil is also the same .shape and larger than the nasal aperture which is placed anterior to the eye and superior in position.
The internasal region is equal to the vertical diameter of the eye.
The rostral flap is produced considerably anterior to the tip of the upper jaw.
Gillrakers numerous iitrong the longest about equal to the pupil of the eye but the last are not as large as the others.
Branchiostegal radii about 12 and in all the examples those on the left ceratohyal overlap those on the right.
Top of the head with pores and somewhat laterally and above the prseoperculum rugose tracts are seen.
Origin of the P. superior on b level with the upper margin of the eye and but little behind the posterior margin of the branchialaperture about equal to the head in length without beak and much longer than the base of the D. its length contained in the space between its origin and that of the V. twice.
Radii of P. I.
10.
The oiigins of the V. nearer the tip of the P. than the base of the caudal and nearer the latter than the branchialaperture before the origin of the D. and reaching more than halfway in the space between their own bases and that of the A. Radii of V. 6 rather short and flattened and the innermost the strongest.
Xearly  of the D. is anterior to the origin of the A. whose base is about f the leuorth of that of the D. The radii of the D. differ from the number given by Lay and Bennett as there are 14 in all 3 of these examples and there are also a few small scales at the bases of several of the foremost.
As most of the rays of the fins have been more or less damaged it is not possible to give a comparison of the length of the rays of the D. yet I do not think that the second if any longer at all than the third was very much so and in 2 of the examples the last ray which is better preserved than some of the others is longer than the shorter rays of the fin and which immediatelv precede it.
The radii of the A. vary from 12 to 14 the first the shortest and the second and third the longest.
Caudal deeply forked the lower lobe the longest and the rays strengthened as in many of the other species.
The rudimentary caudal rays are flattened and the lower are much larger than the lupper.
Lateral line present running inferiorly along the ventral region to the lower rays of the caudal and its course traversing about 60 scales x so many of the scales have been lost and the specimens have been in alcohol so many years any traces of the color in life would naturally be supposed to have disappeared yet there is a bright silvery lustre alOut the head and the eyes are yellowish.
Total length 13f inches the beak measuring mostly 2 inches.

The V. are furnished with scaly flaps and there is also one between their bases.
The scales along the base of the unpaired fins with the exception of those at the base of the spinous D. which are as large as those on the sides of the body are all very small and extend over the greater part of the fins.
There is a line of demarcation between the bases of these fins showing where the finrays articulate with the interneural and interhajmal spines.
Caudal deeply emargiuate and the upper lobe a little longer than the lower.
The lateral line is strongly arched and not extending as far posteriorly as the last A. ray.
Scales about 32 tubes 20.
The caudal peduncle is rather strong and much compressed and its depth is more than  the length of the head.
In alcohol these specimens are dark brownish with the bases of the soft D. and A. and also the caudal spotted.
The P. shows faint traces of spot
or blotches.
Entire length about 4J inches.

The form of the body somewhat ellipsoid compressed the snout not conspicuously or abruptly blunt and with the greatest depth of the body contained in its length without the caudal twice.
The head is contained in the body without caudal S times and the head is about equal to h the greatest depth of the body.
The eye is superior and anterior in position a little over 3 in the head and its diameter greater than the snout.
Nostril very near the front margin of the eye and slightly inferior to its centre.
Orbitals broad none equal to the eye the anterior the deepest and about equal to f the eye and the margin of the praeoperculum is distant from the posterior margin of the eye about the same.
Mouth small most likely reaching to the front of the eye when closed.
The orbitals are furnished with a single series of scales below the eyes but they do not reach as far as the anterior margin of the eye.
The margin of the prteoperculum is inclined forwards and the angle would form below the posterior margin of the eye in the vertical.
There are four series of scales on the cheeks.

The basal third of the P. covered with minute scales the radii of the fin about 20 the radii of the V. I 4 the first soft ray produced the tip of which is broken and reaching for about f the distance from its base to the oi'igin of the A. and entirely destitute of scales.
The spinous D. much longer than the soft T. but not equal to the latter in height radii XII 18 the first spine the shortest the next longer and all the rest still longer and about equal.
The base of the D. is covered with scales those on the spinous D. larger and entirely covering the basal half of that portion of the fin while those on the soft D. are rather minute.

Form of the body oblong compressed the greatest depth contained in the total length exclusive of the caudal about 2 times and the head in the same excluding the opercular flap 3i times.
The head has a rhomboid appearance due to the produced opercular flap which is not as long as the diameter of the eye.
The eye is situated in the upper anterior part of the head in which it is contained exclusive of the opercular flap a trifle over 4 times in the snout about 1 times and in the iuterorbital space the same.
The angle formed by the suout would not be a right one.
The upper profile is concave in front of the interorbital space then straight to the occiput after which it is convex to the origin of the D. The nostrils are placed anterior to the eye and not an eye diameter distant the anterior a little lower than the posterior pair which are placed about midway in the space between the anterior pair and the anterior margin of tiie eye.
The prieorbital greater than the diameter of the eye and the infraorbitals barely  the diameter of the eye botli are unevenly striated.
Mouth protractile capable of considerable distension furnished with 4 conspicuous projecting compressed teeth which are turned forwards and provided with a grinding edge there are two teeth in each jaw the lower pair are closer together than the upper and fit in between the latter wheu the jaws are closed.
The corners of the closed mouth fall a little posterior to the anterior nostrils in the vertical.
The lips are well developed and fleshy.
The pnvojerculum operculum suboperculum and the interoperculum striated.
The entire head is naked the snout interorbital and cranial regions have the skin finely roughened the cheeks smooth.
The angle of the prffioperculum Avhich would be an obtuse one falls below the posterior margin of the eye.
Branchial aperture moderate gillmembranes united to the isthmus gillslits small and the gillrakers also small and short.
Pseudobranchije developed.
Origin of the D. in advance of that of the P. which is in advance of the origin of the v. about over the posterior margin of the operculum the flap excluded.
The T.
spines are firm the first the shortest the next larger and the third longer and together Avith the others about equal though none are as high as the highest soft rays.
The P. shorter than the head though longer than the V. which are attenuated having their first rays reaching the anus and they have the basal portion of the innermost ray connected with the body by a membrane.
The origin of the A. falls below the first ray of the soft D. and also the tip of the P. which reaches that far posteriorly.
The A. spines are much shorter than any of the rays of the fin and they are graduated from the first which is the smallest to the third.
The soft A. rays of nearly equal height though the terminal one is the shortest and not situated as far posteriorly as the last soft D. ray yet both reach the base of the caudal.
No scales along the bases of any of the fins except some at the base of the caudal which are very fine.
The lateral line is not absolutely parallel with the dorsal outline of the back traversing about 20 scales in the form of single tubes when it decurves and runs along the sides of the caudal peduncle to the base of the caudal.
Each scale is furnished with a small rounded whitish spot.
The D. and A. together with the head are also furnished with similar spots and on the former there are several longitudinal lines.
All the spots of the dorsal region of the body much smaller than those on the sides and the scales being also smaller they appear to form longitudinal bands.

Form of the body elongated much compressed deepest in the pectoral region from which it diminishes backwards to the caudal.
The greatest depth is contained in the total length without caudal 3 times.
The head is elevated 3 times in the total length without caudal much compressed snout not produced and the anterior profile very parabolic though slightly convex.
Lower profile line of the head a very slightly inclined oblique line.
The eye is situated in the upier part of the head nearly median in its length about once its diameter from the occiput contained in the greatest depth of the head about 0 times contained in the space between its anterior margin and the tip of the upper jaw 3 times contained in the total length of the head 6J times and it is also equal to the interorbital space.
The interorbital space is convex and greatly produced.
The nares are small both very close together the anterior pair about an eye diameter from the anterior margin of the eye.
The invorbital is very long and broad the infraorbitals narrow and about equal to half an eye diameter.
Mouth narrow the distal extremity of the maxillary below the anterior margin of the eye in the vertical.
Teeth strong the outer lateral teeth larger than the olheis except the canines which are in two pairs on the anterior portions of the jaws those in the lower jaw closer together than the upper pair and fitting in lietweeu the latter when the mouth is closed.
The lips are largo and fioshy those on the sides of the lower jaw forming 2 thin flaps.
Mouth beiow the upper basal portion of the P. The angle of the prseoperculum is a very obtuse one and would form very little posterior to the posterior margin of the eye.
The opercular bones which shield the branchial aperture have their lower and posterior margins furnished with membraneous flaps.
The gillmembranes are very thick and tough though they are not connected with the isthmus.
Gillrakers moderate.
Pseudobranchiffi developed.
The head is naked except a series of 6 scales which descend obliquely forwards from the postorbitals though not extending anterior to the centre of the eye in the vertical.
There are also 2 scales anterior and superior on the upper margin of the operculum.
The origin of the D. is at a point a trifle posterior to the median vertical keel of the pneoperculum.
The first radii of the D. are developed as 2 pungent spines the tip of the first ending in a short filament and about the same height as the spines which succeed them and which are rather strong and firm and not at all pungent.
The branched rays of the D. are longer than the spines and the terminal ray when depressed reaches the base of the caudal.
D. II VII 12.
Origin of the A. below the first D. ray and the terminal ray is produced like the same of the D. so that when it is depressed it also reaches the base of the caudal.
Spines of the A. short graduated from the first to the third which is the longest and the radii of the fin III 12.
Base of the last A. ray slightly posterior to that of the soft D. The P. is contained If times in the head radii of the fin I 11 and their origins are below the centre of the body and above the origin of the V. Innermost ventral ray joined to the body by a membrane and the tips of the fin do not reach the origin of the A. though they extend beyond the tips of the P. The lateral line with 24 single tubes the greater portion parallel with the dorsal outline of the back from which it is distant a scale's breadth interrupted after traversing 20 scales then appearing on the caudal peduncle in a mediolateral position and continuing to the base of the caudal.
There are 26 scales in a lateral series from the operculum to the base of the caudal.
Caudal rounded.
A narrow bluish band from the lower anterior portion of the eye running downwards to behind the corner of the mouth parallel with this are other vertical lines running from the eye and the upper part of the head one on the prseoperculum is broad and the opercles are furnished with narrow lines on their posterior portion.
General color dull brownish the fins immaculate.
Total length 7 inches.

It is interesting to observe that this specimen was taken nearly sixty years before the one described by Dr. Jenkins and even yet it sliows wellpreserved traces of its once brilliant colors.
The markings of the head are especially distinct and are in the form of somewhat irregular crescents with the convex side bending anteriorly.
Three of these markiucs radiate from the inferior margin of the eye though there is 1 anterior to these and more horizontal and they all become more vertical posteriorly.
There are also 2 broad vertical bars between the eye and the P. On the sides of the head below and somewhat posterior to the eyes and anterior to the base of the P. are a number of blackish spots which are distributed over the bands.

Head 2 in the body without the caudal.
Nares well developed the posterior pair the largest.
Mouth rather broad horizontal when closed the jaws are equal and also furnished with small teeth.
Lips moderately developed.
The maxillarv which is very oique extends posteriorly for  of the diameter of the eye.
The preorbital is armed with a broad sharp spine projecting obliquely downwards parallel with the maxillary.
The interoercuIum is armed with a spine and the prseoperculura has 5 curved spines along its posterior margin the lower the largest.
On the upper posterior part of the operculum are 2 broad flattened spines.
The top of the head and the interorbital space is villosely osseous and over the eyes are 2 larger ossifications.
The branchial aperture is moderate lateral in position and the gillmembranes are joined to the isthmus which is large and fleshy.
Gillrakers moderate most numerous osteriorly.
Pseudobranchitc Avell developed.
No slit after the last gillarch.
Origin of the D. over the tips of the opercular spines a little before that of the P. and the fin is divided the spinous portion with YIII spines and the soft portion with 12 rays the last of which is adnate along its posterior margin to the caudal peduncle by a membrane.
The third D. spine is the longest and the second is longer than the seventh and eighth while the soft rays are more even those anteriorly the longest and the rays gradually become shorter posteriorly.
P. with VIII simple and 5 branched rays.
V. more or less rudimentary radii I o.
A. spines II isolated from the soft rays of the fin which are 12 and the last is adnate to the caudal peduncle by a membrane.
The 2 spines of the A. are a little posterior to the origin of the soft D. The lateral line is conspicuous and runs from above the branchial aperture to the base of the caudal.
Body naked papillose.
Caudal small and rounded.
Color in alcohol brownish much darker above and with numerous small round whitish spots.

Form of the body elongate the gieatest depth a trifle over 5 in the tolal length.
The head is compressed and including the opercular flap is contained in the total length about 5 times.
The eyes are anterior and high in the head small contained in the head with opercular flap nearly 8 times in the iuterorbital space 1 times and nearly 2 in the snout.
iIouth rather large and prominent and with the lower jaw jDrojecting.
Lips large thick and fleshy there are 4 superior buccal barbels of about equal length and 6 inferior mandibular ones which are longer than the former.
The anterior nares which are near the posterior a.r are furnished with a pair of barbels which are also larger than the rest of the upper ones.
The anterior nares are about an eye diameter from the eyes and their aperture is smaller than that of the posterior pair.
Teeth of the jaws vomer and palatines small and in many series forming broad and welldefined patches.
The maxillary is oblique very broad at the distal extremity reaching beyond the posterior margin of the eye and its width at that point is equal to the length of the snout.
The supplemental maxillary is well developed thus accounting for its broad distal extremity.
The maxillaries themselves are more or less partly concealed by the orbital flap of skin.
The branchial aperture is large the gillmembranes joined to each other and crossing the isthmus but not joined to it.
No pseudobranchise.
Gillrakers as long as the eye and a slit after the last gillarch.
On the superior and anterior part of the operculum is a partly erectile spine directed backwards which is about as long as the eye.
The V. which are bifid are jugular in position and their origin is not quite an eye diameter posterior to the distal extremity of the maxillary and their tips extend posteriorly as far as the tips of the P. which is about halfway between the base of the P. and the anus.
The origin of the P. is anterior to that of the D. and the fin is contained nearly twice in the head.
The D A. and caudal are continuous the latter terminating in a point.

A fine specimen with the veiy elongate tapering body peculiar to the genus in which the greatest depth which is a little posterior to the P. is contained 11 times.
The head is contained in the body 9 times its greatest depth contained in its own length 1times though its breadth is a trifle greater than its greatest depth.
The eyes are circular anterior and superior greater than the snout and contained in the length of the head about 6 times.
Top of the head broad nearly flat or only very slightly convex the cheeks swollen and the interorbital space equal to 1eye diameters.
The snout is obtuse blunt and with the jaws equal when closed.
Teeth in the jaws pluriserial well developed.
Vomerine and palatine teeth larger and more conical than those of the jaws especially the former.
Maxillaries oblique the distal extremity expanded and posterior to the posterior margin of the eye.
Branchial aperture large the gillmembranes free from the isthmus but forming a fold which passes over it.
Brauchiostegals robust.
Pseudobranchiee absent.
Gillrakers in moderate number and nearly as long as the eye.
Nares small.
The operculum is prolonged posteriorly into a little flap.
Genitoanal apertures anterior to the origin of the very short P. which is contained in the length of the head 4 times.
Both the D. and A. are very little developed so that I am unable to locate the origin of the former but that of the latter falls a short distance behind the base of the P. The body is completely naked and the lateral line is distinct and straight from above the branchial aperture to the tip of the caudal.
The color in alcohol is at present a rich light Ijrown with very minute dark spots or dots and there also appears to have been marblings of another darker color than the ground color but not so dark as the dots.
The cheeks are also somewhat darker than the ground color.
Total length 7 inches.

Form of the body oblong the greatest depth 4 in the total length head about the same but much longer than deep.
The eye is situated in the anterior part of the head and above the centre of its deith contained once in the snout of in the head and If times in th iuterorbital space which is evenly though shallowly convex and also contained in the head 2 times.
The eye is furnished Yith an adipose eyelid the posterior portion of which is broader than the anterior portion and also covers the greater part of the iris.
The nostrils are placed superiorly both pairs closer together than the viidih of the interorbital space and when viewed laterally the anterior is half an eye diameter anterior and superior to the centre of the eye and is rounded.
The posterior nostrils are slitlike superior to the anterior and nearer the front margin of the eye than the centre of the space between the anterior pair and the anterior margin of the eye.
Mouth very protractile lips moderately thin and the symphysis of the mandible is elevated and fits into a depression in the centre of the roof of the upper jaw when the mouth is closed.
The depth of the mouth that is the space between the symphysis of the mandible and the corner of the mouth is more than ithe width of the breadth between both corners of the same.
The angle made by the mandibulary bones would be an obtuse one.
The maxillaries are completely hidden when the mouth is closed.
The corners of the mouth are a trifle posterior to the posterior nostrils.
The praorbital is small scaleless and with the lower margin denticulate.
Head covered with scales except the jaws and the opercles at present are also nude but they were most likely scaled during life.
Gillrakers long and well developed.
Pseudobranchise well developed.
Origin of the P. above the centre of the body though the base of the fin is not as high as the upper margin of the eye directly behind the branchial aperture shorter than the head and extending posteriorly a trifle beyond the origin of the spinous D. Eadii of P. I 15.
The origin of the V. is about halfway between the origin of the P. and its tip and it reaches posteriorly beyond the centre of the space between their bases and the anus.
The anus is directly below the tip of the second D. spine when the fin is depressed.
Radii of V. I 5 the innermost rays joined to each other and to the body by a membrane at their bases and there is also a large arrowshaped scale between their bases.
The P. are also furnished with a scale at their bases.
The soft D. differs from that of any other species of Mugil known to me by having 5 rays and they all appear to be branched rays as there is no anterior spine present in this fin.
The origin of the soft D. is over the fourth or fifth soft A. ray.
The spinous D with IV spines the first 3 large and well developed the third thin and shorter than the second and fourth is about f the length of the second which is the longest.
There are 2 elongated scales at the base of the spinous D  which lie on the back.
Origin of the A. posterior to the anus radii III 9 the anterior rays the longest and the terminal longer than the median.
The A. is covered with small scales especially anteriorly the scales extending on the fins as far as the tip of the third spine which is the longest the first being the shortest.
The soft D. appears to have had the basal portion covered with scales.
Caudal very deeply emarginate the lobes pointed and the basal portion scaled.
Caudal peduncle compressed and equal to the interorbital space.
As the scales on the anterior part of the body have been removed I shall count the scales from the upper posterior margin of the operculum to the base of the caudal yet they are in places removed so that the count is approximate  34.
The color is a dull silvery without any conspicuous markings.
Total length d inches.
I have named this species for Dr. Caldwell who collected the type.

SOME ARACHNIDA FROM ALABAMA.
BY NATHAN BANKS.
The following spiders and allied Arachnids were collected in Alabama for the most part by Prof. Carl F. Baker and his students.
Some however were gathered by Prof. Baker's predecessor.
Dr. L. M. Underwood.
A few very interesting ones were taken by the late Mr. Hugo Soltau near Mobile.
When no locality is given the specimens come from the vicinity of Auburn.
The following students assisted in making the collections  Messrs. Allen Dixon Dobbin Eppes Farley Houghton McCalla Minge Ransom Shevers Stewart and Warwick from Auburn and Hudnion from Opelika.
All the localities are in the souLhern .portion of the State collections in the hilly northern part 'would doubtless add many forms to the list while on the Gulf coast a few semitropical forms would be found.
The Arachnid fauna of Alabama is of much interest to the modern student since this State was one of the collecting grounds of Prof. Hentz the father of American Arachnology.
A number of species described by Hentz have been unkuown to later naturalists and the systematic position of some of them in much doubt.
In this collection several of these forms appear which enables me to place them in their proper position.
Perhaps the most interesting of these species is the one described by Hentz as Katadysas jumilus.
Hentz believed this spider to be intermediate between the two great divisions of the Araneida  those with four lungslits and vertically moving fangs and those with two lungslits and laterally moving fangs.
Katadysas was reputed to have but two lungslits yet with vertically moving fangs.
The general appearance of Hentz' figure led several writers to believe that Katadysas was a Zora or near that genus.
lu this collection there is one specimen of Katadysas pumilas which proves to belong to the genus Zora a genus new to our country.
Of scarcely less interest was the scorpion of which Prof. Baker sent me many specimens.
This scorpion proves to be quite different from the ordinary scorpion of the Southern States long known as Centrurits carolinianus Beauv This species is the form described by C. L. Koch as Vejovis carolinus.
I had no idea that there were two scorpions common in the Southern States and its discovery was of much concern to me.
In looking up the literature on the subject however I found that what was evidently the same species had been recorded by Mr. J. P. Stelle in 1870 in the American Entomologist as occurring in Tennessee.
This species is abundantly different from our common Centrums belonging to another family and exhibiting many minor points of difference.
A few other interesting species may be mentioned Alyrmecojyhila foliata Atk. which proves to be the same as Mygale fluviatilis Hentz Any2hcena piseatoria Heniz one of the lost species easily recognized by the peculiar shape of the male palpus  Dolomedes albi7ieus Hentz a pale species of the genus and Lycosa missouriensis a curious species which I described several years ago from one Missouri specimen is represented by many examples.
Mr. Soltau sent several small forms that add interest to the hst one a new genus of Dldynidie is remarkable on account of its near approach to certain sixeyed forms.
Except in the small Theridiidce where the woodland species have not been well collected this collection gives one a fair idea of the spider fauna of the region.
Most of the species are widely distributed in the Atlantic States very few but are found in more northern regions.
A few forms are more common in regions to the south such are Amjphmia striata Gaucelmiis angiitinus Argyrodes nejhikc Prostheclina aurata and Lyssomanes viridis.
Altogether one hundred and thirtythree spiders are recorded and twelve other Arachnids  a total of one hundred and fortyfive species.
