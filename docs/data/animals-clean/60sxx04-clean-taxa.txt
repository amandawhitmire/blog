ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF SCALPELLIFOEM BARNACLES.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY.
The genus Scalpellum as at present limited is more numerous in species than any other genus of Cirripedes comprising about 170.
Since nearly all of them live in rather deep water and only small areas of the sea bottom beyond the 100fathom hne have been thoroughly explored we have reason to believe that their number will be vastly augmented by future investigation.
The species now known are very unequally related.
Up to the year 1907 not much progress had been made towards a natural classification although the key constructed by Dr. P. P. C. Hoek for the arrangement of the Challenger species was a stride in that direction.
In 1907 two attempts were made to group the species more naturally and to indicate their phylogenetic relations.
Dr. Hoek and the present writer independently and almost simultaneously proposed to split Scalpellum into a number of subgeneric groups.
The two essays were based upon antipodal material Dr. Hoek's upon East Indian my own upon American forms.
Some divergence in the view taken of the comparative value of characters would be expected  yet the points of agreement are so numerous that one may entertain the idea of attaining an approximately natural arrangement by uniting the best features of the two classifications.
Hoek's studies have illumined the more primitive groups so richly represented in the East  forms inadequately represented in the collections I had studied.
On the other hand the material before me demonstrated I think that the form of the carina has Httle value in classification.
Groups based upon the structure of this plate I believe to be heterogeneous.
I was first led to this conclusion by an examination of the species composing the group of Scalpellum stroemii as assembled in my report on the barnacles of the National Museum.
These forms agree so completely in the total structure that it is quite impossible to doubt their close relationship yet the carina varies 1 SibogaExpeditie Cirripedia Pedunculata p. 58.

105 by insensible degrees from simply arched with apical umbo to angular with the umbo remote from the apex.
In the group of Scalpellum scalpellum and the group of S. cHceratiim there is similar variation in the carina yet one cannot doubt that these are natural groups.
These and other like instances show that to rank the shape of the carina whether simply bowed or angular as a character of the first importance is to oppose it to the evidence of all the rest of the organism.
In Scalpeuum stearnsi I find that the umbo of the carina is very close to the apex in quite young individuals becoming more remote with age hence the angular shape of the carina Fig.

being a feature acquired late in the ontogeny of the individual has probably been assumed only recently in the evolution of the groups.
These considerations teach I think that an angular carina has been independently acquired by unrelated species of many phyla.
It cannot be considered a criterion of relationship.
Another character which has not received due weight in taxonomy is the morphology of the complementary males.
Former classifications have been based solely upon the hermaphrodite or female form which has been far less diversely modified than the male.
When we drop as misleading the arrangement of species according to the shape of the carina it appears at once that the structure of the little males is wonderfully correlated with certain features of the hermaphrodites especially the development of a subcarina.
The least specialized males belong to hermaphrodite forms which are known by morphological and palaeontological evidence to be old generalized types.
The most modified males are those of the highly evolved hermaphrodite or female forms.
A classification fully supported by both sexes surely rests upon a broader base than one ignoring the males.

In this group a median pair of latera lies between the scutum and carina.
There are 3 or 4 pairs of latera in all 13 or 15 plates.
Otherwise both sexes are similar to Calantica.
In a few species peronii uncus the carina is angular but in others it has an apical umbo.
Most of the known species are IndoPacific.
Type S. peronii Gray fig.
1 c d.
Dr. Hoek's group Protoscalpellum of which I take S. pollicipedoides to be the type differs from Smilium chiefly by having an additional pair of latera in the type species.
S. pollicipedoides is interesting from its tendency toward multiplication of basal latera which Dr. Hoek has discussed with his accustomed insight.
Smilium and Calantica might without great violence be united as subgenera of a single more comprehensive genus yet I think the elevation of a pair of latera above the basal whorl to the position of upper latera is a morphological advance worthy of being signalized by generic distinction.
In other characters the two groups are almost identical.
The complemental males are alike.

Genus EUSCALPELLUM Hoek.
EuscalpeUum Hoek in part SibogaExpeditie Cirripedia 1907 p. 59 for Scalpellum rostratum peroni uncus and stearnsi.
This genus differs from those preceding chiefly by the more degenerate males which are rather sacklike not distinctly divided into capitulum and peduncle and have only three valves the scuta being larger than in Scal'pellum.
A subcarina is always present.
The inframedian latera have a peculiar square shape and are quite large.
There are 4 pairs of latera in all therefore 15 valves a number never reached in Scalpellum which has no subcarina.
The rostrum is very large and prominent.
The carina has a submedian umbo in the first two species apical in the others.

Species four or five.
Dr. Hoek selected no type for his group Euscalpellum and I have therefore taken his first species as typical.
The characters and limits of the group are also much modified since I place no weight upon the shape of the carina but emphasize the structure of the male the presence of a subcarina etc.

The males are very degenerate sacklike without a peduncle or mouth the cirri vestigeal valves absent or extremely small.
The female or hermaphrodite has no subcarina thereby differing from all the preceding genera upper latera are alwa3s present and three pairs of lower latera rostrum is comparatively small or absent.
The position of the umbo of the carina varies from submedian to apical.
Plates 14 or when the rostrum is absent 13. Type S. scalpellum L. fig.lScalpellum is morphologically the highest or most modified member of its family both by the profoundly degenerate males and the advanced type of armor of the hermaphrodites or females.
Primarily the genus divides into two subgeneric groups as follows  a. Inframedian latus large pentagonal or with the angles rounded wide throughout the umbo varying from submedian to basal or on the rostral border never apical.
Subgenus Scalpellum s. str.
a'.
Inframedian latus generally smaller than the other latera triangular hourglassshaped or irregular.
Subgenus Arcoscalpellum Hoek.
 The mere number of plates in the capitulum is not especially significant since the same number may be present in different genera but made up of morphologically different plates as in the case of 13valved species of Scalpellum and Calantica.
The restricted subgenus Scalpellum is undoubtedly a natural group well characterized by the development of a large inframedian pair of latera.
The umbones of the carina and scutum are frequently removed from the apices of those plates but this is a variable character.
Two species S. inerme Annandale and S. patagonicum Gruvel have the plates imperfectly calcified.

Subgenus Arcoscalpellum Hoek.
All of the other species described as Scalpellum form a group systematically equivalent to the restricted subgenus Scalpellum but the great number of species including several phyla with degenerate partly chitinous plates may make it expedient to recognize several sections by name.
Arcoscalpellum Hoek type S. velutinum Hoek fig.
1 i j includes all of the species of Sections IV and V of my paper on National Museum Barnacles pp.
25 to 68 and all of those included in Arcoscalpellum in Hoek's Siboga report pp.
85 to 120 besides various other allied forms previously known which need not be enumerated here.
There is a distinct tendency in certain forms of Arcoscalpellum towards the evolution of a phylum which will have only eleven plates by elimination of the inframedian latera.
In iDarnacles of the group of  Arcoscalpellum is exactly equivalent to Holoscalpelhon Pils.. Bull.
60 U. S. N.
Mus. p. 25 published a few days later than Hoek's work.
Scalpellum aurivillii these latera are very much reduced and in some cases are displaced lying free over the adjacent rostral latus which actually comes in contact with the carinal latus.
 The considerable number of species showing this reducting of the inframedian latera gives ground for the belief that an 1 1valved type of Scalpellum will eventually be evolved if indeed it does not already exist.
The following groups with partially calcified valves have been derived from the Arcoscalpellum stock.
The section Mesoscalpellum Hoek type S. javanicum Hoek consists of partially calcified barnacles which are shown by their ontogeny now known pretty fully in a few forms to be descended from fully calcified forms of Arcoscalpellum like S. idioplax or S. carinatum.
The evidence at hand indicates the existence of several collateral lines probably derived from as many normal species so that the group is a polyphyletic one.
The early postlarval stages in at least two species which I have worked out and figured S.
larvale and S. japonicum are indistinguishable from Arcoscalpellum.
Mesoscalpellum will include for the present besides the forms described in Hoek's Siboga report the group of S. intermedium S. intermedium S. nipponense S. laccadivicum  the group of S. japonicum the group of S. larvale and that of S. gruveli S. gruveli S. imperfectum S. sanctcebarhane .
The section Neoscalpellum Pilsbry type S. dicheloplax contains the most modified of the imperfectly calcified forms  bizarre skeletonlike creatures with all the paired plates reduced to narrow diverging rami.
The early stages are not known but halfgrown individuals show an approximation to the condition of adults of the S. japonicum group so that a common origin is probable and it may be found superfluous to retain Neoscalpellum as a separate section.
The species are widely scattered geographically and all inhabit abysmal depths.

GENERIC TYPES OF NEARCTIC REPTILIA AND AMPHIBIA.
BY ARTHUR ERWIN BROWN.
By the adoption of the new Article 30 of the International Zoological Code at the Boston meeting of the seventh Congress in August 1907 the methods of nomenclature are brought measurably nearer to uniformity perhaps as near as is possible under any set of rules for it must always be true of inelastic rules  and fortunate that it is so  that they cannot excuse the individual from the exercise of independent judgment in cases such as those where diverging opinions may fairly be held as to their application.
Absolute agreement is not likely to be reached until in respect of the past names themselves are formally adopted by general accord instead of rules.
So completely representative a body as the International Zoological Congress having unanimously adopted the new Article the way is made easy for the minority of zoologists who are dissenters as to some of its provisions for they may now be willing to yield their practice to so great a preponderance of opinion in matters which are those onl' of convention.
For this reason the Code is here followed in all essential details even to the acceptance of undefined genera such as those of Fitzinger in the System Reptilium in place of others which in the author's own opinion have a better claim to be preferred.
But it is not now profitable to discuss the question.
For most of the genera here included types have been ascertained from time to time as necessity required but the whole list has now been redsed in accordance with the present rule.
No full synonymy of the genera has been attempted the names cited as equivalents being only those that have been in recent use for the whole or a part of the contents of the one adopted.
REPTILIA.
The name was first used by Laurenti 1768 for his three divisions I Salientia II Gradientia III Serpentes and included all reptiles and amphibians.
The correct limits of the class were first laid down by Gray Annals of Philosophy 2 10 p. 194 1825.

By Linnaeus they were placed in his genus Lacerta.
By Laurenti in Gradientia with lizards and tailed amphibians.
By most other early authors under sauriens or saurii usually with lizards.
Emydosauriens was used by Latreille 1801 and Blainville 1816.
This was Latinized into Emydosauria by Gray 1825.

No other of the early authors added exactness to its use.

As A. carolinensis D. and B. rests on a firm basis in Catesby it would seem that this name should not be disturbed and that hullaris of authors should be permitted to remain in obscurity.

The use of Natrix Laur.
for this genus does not appear to me obligatory or excusable.
The rule under which types of undefined genera are accepted does not constrain or even imply that in the case of an originally defined genus a species must be accepted as type having characters contrary to the definition.
If it did so the only consistent course would be to admit that the Code does not consider definitions at all.
It was pointed out by me Science July 6 1907 p. 117 that of the fourteen recognizable species cited by Laurenti under Natrix now distributed among eight genera the two belonging to the present genus are the only ones at diametric variance with  Truncus glabernitidus which is the sole character of diagnostic value in the definition.
Because Fleming Philos.
of ZooL II p. 291 1822 chose to select an unconforming type for Natrix in T. torquata  Coluber natrix Linn.
 or because the rule of type by tautonomy could be applied to the case it does not follow that we are compelled to use Natrix.
It is still open to rejection for any group as a meaningless conglomerate.
It is also questionable whether Fleming's citation of a species after some of the genera given by him constitutes selection of a type in accordance with paragraph llg of Article 30.
As first published in a posthumous letter from Kuhl Isis 1822 p. 473 Tropidonotus is a nomen nudum.
But four years later it was well defined by Boie Isis 1826 1 204 who credited it to Kuhl and named under it Coluber natrix Linn and viperinus Daudin.
The following year he definitely fixed natrix as the type.

 a change which would have been serious in view of all the connotations of the word coluber.
The present shifting of the term to replace Bascanium following Fitzinger's selection of a type long antedates Collett's designation of Vipera ferus and has the good fortune to preserve both the long established family names Coluhridce and Viperidce.

A.AIPHIBIA.
According to Dr. Stejneger Batrachia was used for the first time by Batsch 1788 as an exact synonym of Salientia Laurenti 1768 for which reason he thinks it should not be used for a diision of wider scope.
Brongniart 1800 had very nearly an exact conception of the contents of this class for he even suspected that the csecilians belong to it but he used only the vernacular '' batraciens.
All other authors omitted csecilians down to 1811 when Oppel used Nuda for the class with orders I Apoda II Ecaudata III Caudata.
Merrem 1820 used Batrachia with I Apoda II Salientia III Gradientia.
Amphibia Linn included reptiles and amphibians but was never used in exact form until Gray correctly applied it Ann.

METHODS OF RECORDING AND UTILIZING BIRDMIGRATION DATA.
BY WITMER STONE.
The custom of recording the dates of arrival of migrant birds has been practised for a great many years in various countries and more recently attempts have been made to encourage the keeping of such records on a uniform plan and to gather them together for the purpose of study and comparison.
In America this work was begun in 1884 under the direction of the American Ornithologists' Union and since 1885 has been conducted by the Division of Biological Survey formerly Ornithology and Mammalogy of the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
All the published records with which I am familiar represent the work of one individual at each station and until very recently there has been no attempt made to compare the records of several observers at practically the same locality.
The meagerness of the data that it is possible for one individual to gather on bird migration compared with the magnitude of the phenomenon must be apparent to all and yet we are constantly attempting all sorts of estimates  as to the rapidity of flight the relation of fluctuation of migration to temperature variation etc.
 based for the most part upon the records of individual observers.
In 1901 the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club of Philadelphia organized a corps of observers for the study of bird migration in this vicinity.
This corps now numbers sixtythree of which thirtyfive are located within ten miles of the center of Philadelphia.
The study and comparison of the yearly records of these observers throws some interesting light upon the accuracy of individual records and suggests some methods by which a more correct index of the progress of migration may be obtained.
Many of the records are presented in detail each year in Cassinia the annual publication of the DelaAvare Valley Ornithological Club and to these as well as to the original schedules returned by the observers I am indebted for the data discussed in the present paper.
In a paper read before the American Ornithologists' Union in New York City in November 1905 and later published in The Condor I first called attention to the possibilities of combining a number of individual records and later Prof. W. W. Cooke of the U. S. Department of Agriculture discussed the same question in a short paper in The Auk for July 1907 p. 346.
These are I believe the only papers dealing with this phase of the question.
The wellknown work of Mr. Otto Herman in Hungary while probably based upon the most extensive series of data ever collected does not so far as I am aware touch upon the comparison of individual records at a single locality.
Individual and Bulk Arrivals.
One of the most important points for consideration in a birdmigration record is an understanding of just what our date of arrival indicates A migrating species is not a definite mass like a railroad train but a scattered host of individuals requiring weeks or even months to pass a given point and moving intermittently consequently there may be a great many dates of arrival at that point according to what part of the moving procession we are considering.
In the schedules furnished by the U. S. Department of Agriculture the date of first arrival is called for and in addition the date when the species was next seen and when it became common.
The object being to differentiate between the arrival of the main flight or bulk of the species and that of individual early stragglers.
With the exception of these schedules nearly all the American migration records with which I am familiar deal only with the date of first arrival and in the publications that have been based upon the records of the U. S. Department of Agriculture only one date is usually iven presumably the date of first arrival.
This would seem to indicate the unsatisfactory nature of the records of bulk arrival as estimated by an individual observer a fact which has impressed itself upon me after twentyfive years' experience in recording and tabulating bird migration data.
It seems altogether too variable a quantity to be of practical value in making any sort of comparisons except in special instances.
Different species of birds vary in the way in which they become abundant at any point some may come in considerable numbers on the very first day upon which they are seen or a day or so after the first arrival while others gradually drift in a few each day until all the usual haunts are populated though it is impossible to say upon just which day they became common.
In other cases large flocks may be seen passing overhead some time before an individuals establish themselves in their local summer haunts.
It seems too that certain species vary in their manner of arrival in different years being concentrated one season and scattered in another.
The proper study of fluctuations in the numbers of each species at any point such as would warrant an estimate of.
bulk arrival requires except in a few cases far more time than the majority of observers can possibly give to the work  if indeed the task is possible for one individual  and consequently where such an estimate has been attempted the personal equation enters to such an extent as to render the results of little value.
It would seem that with the comparatively small amount of time at the disposal of most observers it would be better to suggest the recording of such occasional bulk arrivals as are so marked a feature of the migration as to become obvious rather than to ask for a record of this sort for each species which must from the nature of the case be in the vast majority of instances an estimate.
At the same time however the date of the first arrival often an early straggler does not in itself give us a proper record of the migration of the species and it is here that the combination of a number of local records proves invaluable and furnishes a far more accurate resume of the flight of the species than can possibly be obtained by any individual observer.
For instance take the arrival of the Wood Thrush in the tenmile circle about Philadelphia in the Spring of 1906.
Thirtyone observers recorded it as follows  One on April 25 two on April 28 ten on April 29 five on April 30 eight on May 1 and one each on May 2 3 4 10 and 12.
This record obviously warrants us in saying that for this area pioneer migrants arrived on April 25 and 28 while the bulk of the migration occurred from April 29 to May 1 after which date it was impossible on account of the presence of the bird at almost all points to judge how much further transient migration was in progress.
The dates upon which the first arrivals are massed are obviously the dates upon which the bulk arrived.
The late dates are to some extent due to failure on the part of the observer to be in the field on the day on which the species first arrived but in part they represent actual absence of the species from these particular localities as it is a matter of record that on several occasions a species has been seen regularly for some days at one locality before a single individual has appeared at another station nearby in spite of careful search at the latter place.
The actual progress of the arrival of the Wood Thrush in 1906 within the Philadelphia tenmile circle may be shown more graphically in the accompanying diagrams.

In it he adopts practically the same plan in illustrating the migration of the Swallow in Hungary and as his maps are based upon 5900 returns it is needless to say they are far more convincing than mine.
Comparison of Records.
As already stated most migration records so far obtained are the work of one individual at each locality.
Now when we come to compare the time of arrival of birds at two points or their arrival at the same point on successive years it becomes very important for us to consider the extent to which such records reflect the actual progress of migration.
The discussion on determining dates of bulk movements in the vicinity of Philadelphia has already shown that while a date of first arrival may be perfectly accurate for the limited area covered by an observer it would differ very materially from the earliest date of arrival for the species in a circle of five or ten miles around that observer's station.
The work of the Delaware alley Ornithological Club for the past seven years has shown that within the Philadelphia tenmile circle covering an area with but little variation in altitude we can detect no constant difference in the time of arrival of a species at any two points dependent upon their geographic position.
The eariiest record is just as likely to come from the northern portion of the circle as from the southern portion.
At one time the records seemed to show a slightly earlier date of arrival immediately along the Delaware river as compared with stations a few miles back on slightly higher ground but further data showed this difference to be purely fortuitous.
Therefore we can take the records of any one station within this circle as representing the progress of migration at Philadelphia just as well as those of any other station within the same radius and presumably the average dates of arrival of a species for a number of years at several stations within the circle will be the same.
For certain species which are very conspicuous and which usually arrive in force on the first day of their appearance this is true but in the majority of species it is by no means so.

The amount of difference in the case of individual observers is even greater than that shown above as in these cases the record given for each of the three stations is the result of the combined work of several observers.
I called attention to the percentage of error in the records of individual observers in a paper read before the American Ornithologists' Union at New York in November 1905 and during the Spring of 1907 Prof. W. W. Cooke made some experiments along the same line and his results showed that compared with the combined work of twentythree other observers in the immediate vicinity of Washington D. C in this single season his dates of arrival averaged one and threetenths of a day late and this in spite of the fact that he spent more time in the field and covered a greater variet of country.
In my summary given above a single station averages one and ninetenths of a day later than the earliest average date recorded for the species.
This information however does not help us in using the record of a single observer for comparative study either as between different years or different stations and we are forced to the conclusion that results based upon such individual records are really of but little value for comparative work so great is the possibility of error.
For instance quoting from Prof. W. W. Cooke's papers on the Migration of Warblers and Thrushes as recorded in the schedules of the U. S. Department of Agriculture we have the average dates of the arrival of the following species at Germantown Pa. a suburb of Philadelphia and at Washington D. C.  1 Bird Lore 19051907.

Wood Thrush May 1 April 26 5clays.
Blackthroated Blue Warbler May 6 May 2 4  Ovenbird May V April 23 8  Maryland Yellow Throat April 29 April 21 8 '' These dates being the averages of a number of years would seem to be sufficiently accurate for the purpose of estimating the time of flight of the species mentioned between Washington and Philadelphia and by comparing them we find that it is respectively five days four days eight days and eight days.
The Germantown records quoted from Prof. Cooke's papers are based upon schedules which I filled out for the Department of Agriculture from 1883 to 1890.
I now find that my dates vary from those obtained by other observers in the neighborhood of Philadelphia from 1901 to 1907 just as the latter have been shown to vary from each other.
Had any of the other records from the vicinity of Philadelphia been used in place of the Germantown series as would have been perfectly justifiable a very different result would have been obtained and there is no doubt but that the dates of several individual observers in the vicinity of Washington would show just as much diversity as is shown in our Philadelphia series which would still further vary the results.
In a number of instances moreover the difference between the average date of arrival at Washington and Philadelphia as given in Prof. Cooke's papers is no greater than that between two stations well within the Philadelphia tenmile circle.
In comparing the dates of arrival of species for several consecutive years we also find a considerable variation in the records of nearby stations which we should expect to show uniformit5 For instance taking the eleven species given in the table on page 134 and computing the average dates of arrival for the six years 1901 to 1906 at each of the three stations and then comparing these with the dates of arrival at each cf the stations in 1907 we find that at station No.
I the 1907 dates averaged three days late while at station No.
II they averaged one day late and at station No.
Ill they averaged exactly normal and yet each one of these stations was represented by several accurate observers and there is nothing in their relative geographic position to warrant any difference.
Combination of Individual Records.
After discrediting the value of individual records one must natur2 Omitted in Prof. Cooke's paper and supplied from my own memoranda.
ally suggest some method of recording migration by which results sufficiently accurate for comparative work are to be obtained.
This I think is to be found by securing a large number of observers in a limited area and by combining their results as has been done by the Delaware Valley Ornitliological Club in the vicinity of Philadelphia.
If we had sevenyear records kept by thirtyfive individuals within ten miles of Washington and a similar series within ten miles of Boston for comparison with the Philadelphia series then I think we should be able to estimate with some degree of accuracy the progress of migration between these points.
In a composite record of this kind it is especially worthy of note that more or less fragmentary records are of great value as an observer who only records a hmited number of species may note some of them earlier than any other observer while species which he fails to record are noted by others.
The way in which a number of indvidual records from one vicinity are to be combined in order to get the most reliable results is quite a problem.
Take for example the Ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus for the years 1905 1906 and 1907 as recorded within ten miles of Philadelphia by respectively thirty thirtytwo and thirtyfour observers  the number of the observation corps varying somewhat from year to year.
We find that in 1905 it arrived at one station on April 25 at another on April 28 at eight stations on the 29th ten on the 30th etc. i.e.
 1905 April 25 28 29 8 30 10 May 2 3 4 6 7 2 8 12 2.
1906 April 28 2 29 7 30 4 May 1 5 2 3 3 4 4 2.
5 3 8 12 1907 April 26 2 27 28 4 29 5 30 2 May 1 5 2 2 5 4 6 8 11 4 12 13 15.
If we select the earliest date for each year as the basis of our comparison we shall say that 1905 was the earliest season and 1906 the latest.
The objection to this is that it considers only the earliest stragglers whose movements may or may not reflect those of the bulk of the species.
If we select the average of all the dates for each year we shall have for 1905 May 2 1906 May 2 1907 May 3 or 1905 earhest and 1907 latest.
The objection in this case is that some at least of the late dates of arrival represent errors of observation  i.e. failures to detect the species until it had been present for some days  while others are for stations which are not congenial haunts of the species under consideration and at which it is only occasionally seen and by including these in our computation we obviously make the resultant date too late.
After consideratinj many methods it seems that the best date to select is that upon Wiiich the species had arrived at half of the stations leaving out of consideration entirely the last quarter of the stations that recorded the species in order to eliminate the probably erroneous or misleading dates.
Dropping the last quarter of the stations in the case of the Ovenbird we shall have left for consideration in the three years twentythree twentyfour and twentysix records respectively i.e.
 1905 April 25 28 29 8 30 10 May 2 3 4.
1906 April 28 2 29 7 30 4 Mav 1 5 2 3 3 3.
1907 April 26 2 27 28 4 29 5 30 2 May 1 5 2 2 5 4 6.
The dates by which the species had reached half these stations will then be 1905 April 30 1906 April 30 1907 April 30.
This is perhaps a poor example as the Ovenbird is such a regular migrant.
Indeed a mere glance at the records will show that the bulk of arrivals occurred in 1905 on April 29 and 30 in 1906 on the same days and in 1907 on April 28 and 29 which represents almost the same thing. In other cases.
however the massing of arrivals upon a few days is by no means so evident and some such method as the above is absolutely necessary.

The above plan gives us a definite date for all sorts of comparisons and one which is independent of the personal equation.
The term became common may mean a different thing to each individual but the date upon which a species reached half of the stations at which it was observed represents a definite 'point in the increase of its abundance and is a matter of record and not of opinion.
As so little has been attempted in the way of combining local migration records I find it difficult to discuss the comparative value of different methods.
Some casual allusions by Prof. Cooke to the methods employed by him form indeed the only contribution to the subject with which I am familiar.
He recognizes the clanger of including the latest dates of arrival in computing averages and rejects them just as I have advocated above but in deciding how many to reject his method seems to lack clefiniteness and to involve the personal equation.
He says Auk 1907 p. 347 When using migration records for the calculation of average dates of arrival I usually discard dates that are more than six days later than the probable normal date of arrival.
This would seem to imply an arbitrary selection of the probable normal date before any averaging is done which seems to be a dangerous method.
Again in referring to the combination of the observations of twentythree observers at Washington D. C in the Spring of 1907 he says Many of the notes were duplicates or of no value but after all these had been eliminated etc.
Italics mine.
This is exactly the reverse of my method instead of rejecting duplicate records these seem to me to be of the utmost value as pointing to the dates upon which the greatest migration took place.
It must however be borne in mind that Prof. Cooke in this instance is ascertaining the earliest date  not the date of bulk arrival which as just explained seems to me a more reliable basis for comparison of migration between two distant points but one which as I have also explained is practically impossible in the absence of a large corps of observers at each point.
Graphic Representation of Migration.
In the Auk for 1889 p. 139 and 1891 p. 194 I pubhshed some papers on the Graphic Representation of Bird Migration based in part upon records of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club for 1890.
The attempt was made at this time to record tke actual number of individuals or the relative abundance of certain species as noted each day by five observers and by plotting the daily totals a chart was obtained representing the fluctuations of the migration which was shown to correspond to rises and falls in the curve of temperature variation for the same period.
In my Birds of Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey 1894 p. 28 a like method was employed.
Similar and probably much more accurate results may be obtained by plotting a curve based upon the total first arrivals within the tenmile circle as reported by our Philadelphia migration corps for each day of the Spring.
In the following diagrams such curves are shown for the years 1902 to 1907 accompanied by curves of temperature variation based upon the mean daily temperature at Philadelphia as recorded by the United States Weather Bureau together with an indication of the days upon which rain or snow fell.
For this meteorological data I am under obligations to Mr. T. F. Townsend Director of the Pennsylvania Section U. S. Weather Bureau.
In the early part of the season it will be noticed that waves of migration follow closely after marked rises in temperature but later on at the height of the May migration the great waves  or  rushes  often occur without any corresponding temperature increase.
It is well known that birds do not start to migrate on a rainy night so that it is natural to expect sudden drops in the migration curves to be correlated with spells of rainy weather and such is often the case.
Inasmuch as birds are sometimes overtaken by rainstorms after starting on a clear evening they often arrive at a locality simultaneously with the rain and as.
it is not possible to indicate in the diagrams the exact time and extent of the daily precipitation allowances must be made for some apparent discrepancies in this respect.
In the following diagrams the vertical lines represent the days from February 15 to Iay 18 while the horizontal lines denote five degrees difference in the temperature curve and ten units difference in the migration curve a unit in the latter curve being a first arrival record at some one of the stations within ten miles of Philadelphia.
Thus if the migration curve reaches ten on a certain day it means ten first arrivals i. e. one species recorded for the first time at ten stations two species at five stations each or ten differezit species each recorded at a single station as the case may be.
Periods of rainy weather are indicated by the broken line immediately below the diagram marked rain.
Each migration is divided into two sections placed opposite to each other so that the curves run across both pages with the comments below.
In each chart the upper curve represents temperature variation the lower migration.

waves or rushes  that is to say that the bulk of the migration at each locality occurs on certain nights or series of nights  the question naturally arises To what extent are the several ''waves in successive years composed of the same species
A study of the migration curves will show that there are from eleven to fourteen prominent waves during the Spring taking into consideration only those which show ten or more arrivals in Februar and March fifteen to twent'in April and thirty to one hundred in May.
These seem to me to be the only movements worthy to be styled waves although some have used the term to indicate far less marked movements while others use it only for the most extensive migrator flights.' Selecting fortyseven common species for which we have the fullest data and noting such migrator activity'' as is indicated by each on .the wavedays for the years 1904 to 1907 we find a remarkable correspondence in the species which make up each wave.
And the same ''wave may be recognized through a number of years by its component species though its date may vary considerably.
Sometimes a movement may be interrupted by unsuitable weather and be resumed again later making two apparent waves in one year which correspond to one in other years.
Or when conditions are exceptionally favorable early in the season the species which usually compose Wave II for instance may push forward and form part of Wave I and although conditions at the normal time of occurrence of Wave II may be favorable there will be no movement simply because all the species usually migrating at that time have passed on.
It seems then that certain species migrate together advance stragglers of some accompanying the bulk movements of others and that each species is ready for migration at approximately the same time each year. the exact date depending upon a favorable combination of meteorological conditions.
The following tables will show which of the fortyseven selected species composed the various waves for the four years for which Ave '''Arrival here has the same significance as explained on page 193.

have the fullest data.
Many other less common species arrived on the various  wavedays but their inclusion in the tables would only tend to confusion and would obscure the point that I wish to demonstrate.
Where a species has been omitted in any year it is because it failed to arrive on one of the wave movements or because the bulk movement was scattered and not concentrated on a waveday.
The scarcity of such omissions however illustrates to what an extent the migration is concentrated on a comparatively small number of dajs.
First arrival in these tables denotes the first individual to be reported anywhere within the tenmile circle.

First Arrivals  Nine species have arrived on this wave in at least three of the four years i.e. Scarlet Tanager Yellow Warbler Blackthroated Green Warbler Ovenbird Water Thrush House Wren Catbird Wilson's Thrush and Wood Thrush.
Five otheis arrived in two out of the four seasons i.e. Rosebreasted Giosbeak Whiteeyed Vireo Redstart Maryland Yellowthroat and Yellowbreasted Chat.
Bulk Movement  The bulk of this wave comprised the same seven species in each of the four years i.e. Chimney Swift Barn Swallow BlackandWliite Warbler Myrtle Warbler Maryland Yellowthroat Brown Thrasher and House Wren.
To these are to be added the Yellow Warbler in 1904 and the Ovenbird in 1907.

Six Years Records at Philadelphia.
The following tables present a summary of the arrival dates of the ninety species which are printed upon the schedules of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club for the years 1902 to 1907 based upon the records of from twentyfive to thirtyfive observers for each year all located within ten miles of the center of Philadelphia.
Under first arrival is given the average date of the first observation reported by any of the observers and also the earliest and latest first arrival for the six years under consideration.
Under ''bulk arrival is given the date for each year when the species had been reported at half the stations computed as explained on page 137 and also the average of these six dates.
In some cases the data were too meager to warrant this computation in which instances the 'dates are omitted and only first arrivals given.
In a few species marked by an asterisk dates which obviously referred to winter residents have been rejected while in the case of the Longbilled Marsh Wren Pine Warbler and perhaps a few others the data are probably not sufficient to give accurate results the species being rare or local.
