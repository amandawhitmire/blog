CONTRIBUTIONS TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE Hymenoptera OF BRAZIL NO.
2.P0MPILIDJE.
BY WILLIAM J.
FOX.
In this the second paper based on the collections of Mr. Herbert H. Smith made in Brazil many species are described presumably for the first time.
Much difficulty has been encountered in determining the Pompilida
in question because the writer has been obliged to rely entirely on descriptions which in many instances are faulty and meager.
The difficulty has been heightened by the diversity of classification of the older writers on the subject.
Ceropales abdominalis Tasch.
Corumba April May.
Three female and one male specimen.
Ceropales sp.
A male from Corumba April is close to abdominalis but the antenna
are fulvous beneath the apex of dorsal segments 26 and seventh entirety are yellow and punctuation of head and thorax is coarser.
Notocyphus saevissimus Sm.
Corumba April May  Santarem September.
Notocyphus tyrannicus Sm.
Chapada March.
Six specimens varying from 1928 mm.
The larger specimens lack the purplish and bluish pile mentioned by Smith.

 Structurally this species agrees exactly with terminatus also in the coloration of antennae.
The wings however have the basal twothirds bright yellow the remaining third dark fuscous with the tips of anteriors pale.
Length 18 mm.
Chapada April.
One specimen.
Will probably prove to be a variety of terminatus.
Notocyphus dubius n. sp.

Seems to be near maculifrons Smith and macrostoma Kohl.
From the former it differs in coloration of wings antennae and abdomen.
It is perhaps closer to macrostoma but is larger and judging from Kohl's figure the middle segment is differently shaped.

The species assigned to varipennis Perty by Spinola is evidently not that species.

This species is remarkable for the very transverse head which in many respects is not dissimilar to that of Ceropales.
The hind claws are missing in the only example in the collection which was not the case however when I first examined it.
Then the hind claws as near as I can remember were simple a character which would exclude the species from any of the present known groups of Salius.
Having nothing at present but my memory to rely on I would not care to assert that such a character existed although of the opinion that future specimens will indicate its presence.

NOTES ON PLANT MONSTROSITIES.
BY IDA A. KELLER.
In one of his  Physiologischen Notizen 1 Professor Sachs forcibly calls attention to the exaggerated and erroneous morphological significance which has been attributed to monstrosities.
He contends that monstrosities are simply monstrosities and not  suggestions  as to the typical morphological nature of organs as implied constantly by the teachings of the present day morphology.
2 He urges that it is but proper to regard them as the result of a contest between normal tendencies and accidental external agencies.
His final and emphatic verdict is   Monstrosities represent a chaos without law and order.
3 Professor Goebel takes the same point of view stating that most of the results obtained thus far in the field of teratology must be regarded as useless  the method of reasoning from that which is deformed to that which is normal is a mistaken one.
4 He indicates the direction in which this important branch of botany should be developed when he says   The problem of this science is not to seek in deformities 'revelations' of nature but to explain how these deformities have come to pass.
At all events deformities in plants are extremely interesting.
Although there can be no doubt that the investigator should above all things seek the explanations of their causes yet in the present state of our science it is impossible to discover in most cases the reasons for their occurrence especially if the disturbance is purely a local one.
Descriptions of individual cases will probably prove of value in preparing the way for future generalizations.
Two rather interesting abnormal growths came directly under my notice some time ago.
One was found on a shoot of our common garden woodbine Lonicera Japonica Thunb.
Plate V fig.
1 represents the abnormal branch.
It can readily be seen that the monstrosity was produced by the growing together of the terminating leafpair or according to botanical terminology the leaves had become connate.
It was evident that the activity of the growing point had been suppressed but it is a question not easily 1 Flora 1893.
Sachs.
Ueber Wachsthumsperioden und Bildungsreize.
2 Ibid.
p. 222.
3 Ibid.
p. 233.
4 Ibid.
p. 233. decided whether this suppression primarily caused the deformity hy interfering with the normal cell development or if the center of the disturbance is to be found in the unusual leaf development which thus might have destroyed the activity at the  punctual vegetationis.
The abnormal growth had the shape of a cornucopia which was perfectly hollow and in which every trace of the terminal bud was effaced.
The plant was producing shoots at all available points the normal shoots haviug an appearance such as is represented in Plate V fig.
3.
These were growing so rapidly in length that long before the young leaves had arrived at maturity the growing point had advanced considerably beyond them.
A glance at the figure although little can be gleanedfrom it so far as the cause of the disturbance is concerned will give an idea as to its further effect.
The impetus derived from the external favorable conditions of the season which found expression in the luxuriant growth at all parts of the vine was directed to the pair of leaves below the monstrosity and at this point a branch emerged  the nearest bit of meristem thus became infused with increased activity and the nourishment supplied was turned aside from its original path and sent in a new direction.
Below the deformity the branch had however continued 'to grow in thickness.
The abnormal growth was at first evidently purely a local disturbance there being absolutely nothing unhealthy about the rest of the shoot as is found so often in cases of fasciations due to irregular nourishment or other causes.
As already suggested it will be a difficult matter to decide upon the true and full significance of a monstrosity in each particular case.
A single instance as the one described above will hardly warrant the assumption that it is the expression of a family trait or peculiarity found in allied species.
The temptation is great no doubt to see in this case a tendency to connate growth to which we are accustomed in Lonicera flava and L. Caprifolium cropping out as a monstrosity in L. Japonica.
It must be remembered however that it is far more usual to find that plants which ordinarily bear connate or perfoliate leaves which we are accustomed to regard as later developments will develop also some leaves which are simply sessile as e. g. Uvularia perfoliate Thus it is that in monstrosities so far as leaves are concerned we expect reversions to primitive types rather than the acquirement of new characters.
In the article referred to above Sachs suggests that normal activity can only take place if all phenomena go on with mathematical exactness.
5 He forces one to realize that it is far more wonderful that nature proceeds with almost absolute regularity in the development of organs if we take into consideration the minuteness of the vegetative point and the quite incomprehensible precision with which molecules must travel each to its particular place of destination.
He adds a few molecules which stimulate the formation of anthers might be supposed to deviate the toVt part of a millimeter to the right or to the left of their prescribed path or they might be delayed two or three minutes on their journey  and produce an abnormal growth.
Thus it is that in the crowded condition of the floral organs at the growing point and because of the complex differentiation which must take place here at a very early period that monstrosities in flowers are comparatively frequent.
6 Internal hereditary tendencies no doubt come to the foreground in a greater or less degree  certainly in the most pronounced manner in such cases e. g. as those cited by Sachs in the Iridacese where the inner circle of stamens reappears at times as an abnormal development and thus the type of the Liliaceseis repeated.
Sachs maintains that we might regard the normal Iris type as a monstrosity.
7 It is quite apparent however that such distinctions will depend entirely on the accepted definition of the term monstrosity.
It seems reasonable to suppose that the more complex the condition of an undeveloped tissue mass the greater the possible amount of displacement from the normal position and the less marked externally will be the influence of hereditary tendencies.
In undeveloped foliage leaves where the young parts are apt to exert less influence and are in their turn less dependent on the condition of adjacent tissues we might perhaps expect at times to find in abnormal growths an innate tendency of an entire family.
I will describe in brief another and very different case of monstrosity observed at about the same time as the above.
The plant was the common garden hydrangea Hydrangea hortensis L. Near the end of a shoot and opposite a perfectly normal leaf I noticed one which was composed of two distinct blades.
These were united by the midrib from the base upward about half the length of the leaf and from there on the blades were completely separated.
Plate V fig.
4 is a side view of the double leaf.
It was interesting to note 5 Ibid.
p. 236.
6 Ibid p. 235.
7 Ibid.
p. 234. the pale surfaces which form normally the lower side of the leaf faced each other while the shiny morphological upper surface of the upper blade was turned toward the sky while in the lower blade this was turned to the earth.
The lower blade then so far as its morphological structure was concerned was decidedly in a false position otherwise at least in its contour no irregularity was noticeable except perhaps that it was somewhat smaller than the opposite normal leaf Plate V fig.
7.
The upper blade was correct as to its position but its shape was deformed.
It had two apices the midrib having divided at the point of union of the two blades.
Besides it was somewhat larger than the opposite normal leaf.
The disturbance which caused this monstrosity was also purely a local one since the rest of the plant was in nowise remarkable.
Evidently the growing point was twice induced to divide first in producing two distinct blades and again in the division of the midrib of the upper blade.
A chaos this appears without law and order and yet even in chaos there is a reason or cause for everything.
It would certainly be worth while to know why the under surfaces of the two blades faced each other in such a way as to appear as mirrored images of one another.
