SOME NEW AND LITTLEKNOWN PERCOID FISHES.
BY HENRY W. FOWLER.
In this paper I give an annotated list of the more generalized percoid fishes of special interest to be found in the collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
Other papers dealing with remaining families are expected to follow.
Owing to the more general acceptance of the view among naturalists that the first species under a genus be considered the type I abandon the process of elimination.
Cases only apply where no type is designated or tautonomy is not inferred.
Further I shall retain words different only etymologically though with a strict adherence to the original orthography even when erroneous provided there is no evidence contrary.

This form is apparently closely related to Dulesmarginatus Cuvier.
It differs from Tahiti examples of that species however in having more scales in the lateral line.
In this respect it agrees with Hawaiian and Tahiti examples of Dulesmato Lesson though the latter differs principally in having more gillrakers.
Examples of Dulesrupestris Lacepede from Samoa and Tahiti have the caudal but slightly emarginate.
Named for the Bonin Islands.
Boulengerina subgen.

Type Dulesmato Lesson.
Gillrakers more numerous than in subgenus Dules
Boulengerina has 24 to 28 on the lower part of the first arch while Duleshas 16 to 20.
The specific name of the typical species dates from Dulesmato Lesson Voij.

As the original account of the former is imperfect I accept this view provisionally.
The differences between Holbrook 's figure and the examples before me are certainly not specific.
The pectoral of the former is but little shorter than the head.

MOLLUSC A OF THE OZARKIAN FAUNA.
BY H. A PILSBRY AND JAMES H. FERRISS.
In the midst of the valley of the greatest river of the continent the Ozark Mountains stand above the plain.
On the east and south they are bordered by lowlands scarcely a hundred feet above sea level and westward the great plains stretch to the foothills of the Rockies.
The Ozarks rise to no considerable height the highest point Magazine Mountain in Logan Co. Ark. attaining to 2823 feet but the rough topography in strong contrast with that of surrounding regions affords conditions favoring the evolution of special forms species or races adapted to these conditions.
Many of these forms have probably been evolved just where we now find them and where they are in a measure isolated by the absence or rarity of similar haunts in the lower and more level country surrounding the mountainous area.
Some aquatic forms Unionidce and Pleuroceratidce are also peculiar to the Ozark region though in the main Mississippian species rule.
During the greater part of March and April 1903 the authors collected at numerous places in the western Ozarks in southwestern Missouri western Arkansas and Indian Territory the localities selected being supplemental to those worked by Mr. Ferriss in 1900 and 1901.
The results of our work are herein dealt with.
I. Faunal Relations of the Ozark Region.
The Alleghanian  Transition of Merriam Carolinian  humid Upper Austral and Austroriparian   humid Lower Austral zones as mapped by Dr. Merriam in eastern North America are probably reflected as clearly in land molluscan distribution as in that of vertebrates and plants though of course there is broad overlapping of faunas and the smaller details of the zonal limits remain to be determined by diligent local work.
In the Northern States this local amplification may well be based upon Dr. Merriam's map but in the Southern Appalachian system some significant discrepancies appear when the land moUusks are compared with vertebrate distribution.
 Life Zones and Crop Zones of the United States Bulletin No 10 U. S. Department of Agriculture Division of Biological Survey 1898.
The Boreal Canadian areas mapped by Merriam in Kentucky Tennessee and North Carolina have for mollusca no faunal connection with or resemblance to the Canadian zone fauna of the northern mountains and Canada.
There is no evidence that the northern fauna invaded these heights during the Ice Age but much evidence to the contrary. Had such an incursion taken place it seems hardly conceivable that no Vitrina Pupilla Vertigo or northern Zonitidm should remain to tell the tale.
A certain illdefined zonal distribution dependent on elevation may be traced the mountain tops having a poorer fauna than the lower levels with dwarfed races of some species and a few special species  but the zoological affinities of the forms are in the main with those of the lower coves not with snails of higher latitudes.
This illustrates what has been recognized by a few zoologists working in other departments that transcontinental lifezones have no necessary connection with the larger facts of faunal distribution but define secondary divisions parallel so to speak all over the world.
For instance equal zones in the southern Alleghanies and the Rocky Mountains might be spoken of as  physically homologous ' ' but not faunally so.
In eastern North America we have leaving the Floridian tropical element out of the account two faunas of inland mollusca developed in diverse areas 1 the Boreal fauna consisting of Holarctic species or genera such as Vitrina Zonitoides Enconulus Acanthinula Vallonia Pupilla Punctum Sphyradium Lymnea etc. which apparently had their rise in the north and 2 the Appalachian fauna consisting of forms characteristic of the eastern United States such as the Mesodon Triodopsis and Stenotrema groups Omphalina Vitrinizonites Paravitrea Gastrodonta the alternata group of Pyramidula Helicodiscus etc.
From what we know of the Pliocene land shells and those of the interglacial and postglacial Loess it is clear that these faunas must have been already as distinct at the close of the Pliocene as at present and in the case of the Appalachian fauna we have every reason to believe that its ancestors occupied eastern North America during tertiary time and how much farther back no man can say.  See in this connection Pilsbry Mollusca of the Great Smoky Mountains Proc A. N. S.
Phila. 1900 pp.
110150 and Walker and Pilsbry Mollusca of the Mt.
Mitchell Region Proc.
A. N. S.
Phila. 1902 pp.
413442. 
The boreal and southern elements in the east American fauna were fully recognized by Mr. W. G. Binney many years ago.
Cf.
also Charles C. Adams Southeastern United States as a centre of geographical distribution of flora and fauna Biological Bulletin III pp.
115131 1902.
From the investigations made by the authors and their friends it is obvious that there was in the East no extensive glacial recession of the snail fauna southward beyond the border of the ice sheet.
It seems likely that the northern fauna of Appalachian origin was largely wiped out and the survivors crowded with the boreal forms in a band along the States bordering the glaciated area.
This comparatively recent concentration of the snail population southward gives at first the impression that the radiation of this element of our fauna was from the southeast yet during the mild tertiary period favorable conditions certainly existed much farther north than at present and there seems no more reason to postulate a southeastern than a northeastern tertiary radiation.
In the more elevated Rocky Mountain region there was obviously a more extensive glacial recession.
Boreal genera and species were pushed at least as far as the Mexican boundary where they still survive at considerable altitudes.
The Appalachian types of land snails now extend over all of the Alleghanian Carolinian and Austroriparian zones  but within this area we must recognize several strongly individualized faunas characterizing mountainous tracts.
These are as follows  I.
The AustroAppalachian faima comprising the eastern division of the Appalachian Mountains east of the valley of East Tennessee chiefly in North Carolina south to Georgia.
It is bounded on the north in Virginia and West Virginia by an Alleghanian zone fauna on the highest ridges and a normal Carolinian at lower levels.
The AustroAppalachian fauna has been explored by Dr. Rugel Mrs. George Andrews Mr. Wetherby Messrs. Walker Sargent Clapp and the present authors.
It is mapped as Transition and Boreal in Dr. Merriam's Life Zone map of 1897.
II.
The Cumberlandian fauna including the western division of the Appalachian Mountain system in Kentucky Tennessee and northern Alabama.
The limits of this fauna extend southwestward beyond the nucleus plotted as Transition in Merriam's map.
Our knowledge of this fauna is due to Lea Binney Bland Wetherby Harper and others.
It has been neglected by the present generation of conchologists but careful collections by Mr. and Mrs. H. H. Smith are now in progress on its southern border Alabama.
III.
The Ozarkian fauna limited to the Ozark uplift chiefly in Arkansas but extending into adjacent States north and west.
It is largely mapped as humid Upper Austral   Carolinian by Merriam.
These three faunas possess but few species in common aside from those widespread forms of the whole CaroHnian zone yet they have a similar facies owing to the rich development of Stenotrema and toothed Zonitidce the relative scarcity of Pupillidce etc.
It may be that the resemblances are due to parallelism in evolution of the faunas from a common source yet the possibility may be entertained that the Mississippi embayment which isolates the Ozark uplift was crossed by a ridge permitting rockliving snails to emigrate west from the Cumberland plateau at some period in tertiary time.
This is a geological question aside from our present purpose. There is no mentionable trace of Boreal zone elements in any of the three southern mountain faunas  and no ground exists in the molluscan fauna for mapping even the highest peaks as Canadian or Alleghanian.
The Ozarkian fauna is thus one of several mountain faunas of common origin all traceable to the Appalachian tertiary radiation.
The limits of this fauna can be mapped only after much more field investigation but roughly it includes the broken country of southern Missouri a small area in southeastern Kansas the hilly eastern part of Indian Territory and the greater part of Arkansas east as far possibly as the 500feet contour line but data are absolutely lacking for the definition of its eastern boundary in Arkansas.
We know that on the opposite shore of the Mississippi there is no trace of Ozarkian forms.
Possibly the upland region of northwestern Louisiana should be added.
On the northwest north and northeast of the Ozark area the widespread Carolinian species rule on the southeast and south the Austroriparian and on the southwest the uttermost waves of Lower Sonoran life ripple against the rising Ozark mass.
The several elements of the fauna are here listed.

 Dr. D. S. Jordan writes Streams of the Ozark Mountains similar in character to the rivers of East Tennessee have an essentially similar fish fauna although between the Ozarks and the Cumberland range lies an area of lowland bayous into which such fishes are never known to penetrate.
Science Sketches.
He suggests that the time of mingUng across the lowlands may have been when the intervening region had a colder climate. 
This species spreads southward as far as Galveston etc. but it is listed here because it is an abundant Ozarkian form and has three races confined to that 1906.

Mrs. TroUope in Domestic Manners of the Americans states that Cincinnati has not many lions to boast but among them are two museums of natural history both of these contain many respectable specimens particularly that of Mr. Dorfeuille who has moreover some highly interesting Indian antiquities.
He is a man of taste and science As Mr. Dorfeuille cannot trust to his science for attracting the citizens he has put liis ingenuity into requisition ....
He has constructed a pandemonium in an upper story of his museum in which he has congregated all the images of horror that his fertile fancy could devise ' ' etc.

On the west it is known from Grouse Creek near Arkansas City Kan. and throughout the eastern half of the Indian Territory and in Cooke Co. and Fort Worth Tex.
Southward it penetrates to Washington Co. Tex. in the latitude of Austin.
This species thus inhabits an oblong area about 600 miles long and 300 wide.
In Missouri and Arkansas it is not known from the Mississippi lowlands all known localities being above the 500 feet contour.
In Louisiana and Texas however it descends to half that elevation  On the authority of Mr. J.

 Distribution of Polygyra dorfeuiUiana Lea known localities represented bv dots.
The variety sampsoni Wetherby by its more uncoiled spiral is a more evolved or accelerated race than typical dorfeuilliana.
It occupies the northern central portions of the area while the less evolved typical form is peripheral.
There is however no line to be drawn between them as in many places both forms and the intergrades occur together and in the Choctaw Nation especially most specimens are intermediate in size of the umbilicus.
In 1903 we took the species at eleven localities in Missouri Arkansas and Indian Territory.
Some of the specimens from the bluff along Grand River at Wyandotte near the northeast angle of Indian Territory are the largest I have seen and also the most extreme of the sampsoni form diameter 8 to 9.3 mm.

In originally describing this species.
Dr. Lea gave the locality as Ohio Mr. Dorfeuille Cincinnati Mr. W. G. Binney states that ' ' Mr. J. G. Anthony obtained from Ir.
Dorfeuille some facts concerning the original discovery of this species which prove beyond all doubt that it was accidentally brought from Kentucky.
It is on the strength of this that he reports it from Kentucky opposite Cincinnati.
Binney also records dorfeuilliana from Coosa River Alabama. '
' A somewhat extensive correspondence with active collectors has failed to bring out any definite locality for dorfeuilliana in Kentucky Tennessee or Alabama.
Inquiry among Cincinnati conchologists has elicited no further confirmation of Mr. Dorfeuille's Kentucky record.
Mr. Bryant Walker wTites There are no P. dorfeuilliana from east of the Mississippi so far as I can find in the Wetherby collection.
I have two specimens labelled 'Ky.'
sent me years ago by Anthony and one from the Lathrop collection from ' Wn.
Tennessee.'
 Dr. W. H. Dall of the U. S. National Museum under date of October 21 1905 writes I have looked over our series of dorfeuilliana Lea.
One marked by Lea 'type has the locality 'Cincinnati' but the label records no collector's name but the original description credits it to Dorfeuille.
There is also a fragment from Florida named by Binney dorfeuilliana but which in my opinion is a fragment of avara.
The first is No.
116779 the other 47318.
We do not have it from Alabama.
All our series are from Indian Territory Arkansas Louisiana Texas.
I feel quite confident the Ohio or Kentucky locality is erroneous.
Mrs. George Andrews informs us that no specimens from east of the Mississippi have come to her knowledge aside from the records in Mr. Binney's work already alluded to.
It is our experience that in the transMississippian region where P. dorfeuilliana occurs it is a common snail readily found in all suitable stations and often in considerable quantity.
It is not one of the snails occurring only in restricted localities and requiring special search to find.
It seems therefore doubtful whether its range really extends east of the Mississippi at all and until some definite cisMississippian locality for it is put on record we are disposed to erase Ohio Kentucky Tennessee and Alabama from the ascertained range of the species.
The variety percostata Pils. PI.
XX fig.
23 was based on specimens from the Red River in southwest Arkansas in which the riblets of the upper surface continue over the base which is strongly and coarsely ribstriate.
The sculpture however varies a good deal even in the original lot of several hundred specimens most of which are as smooth as the ordinary form of dorfeuilliana.
The umbilicus while variable in width is never so wide as in typical sampsoni.
The diameter is from 7 to 9 mm.
We hesitate now to treat P. d. percostata as a subspecies yet the tendency in this local race to produce a sculptured base is not present in a great number of other colonies of dorfeuilliana which have been studied in thousands of specimens.

The axis in this species is distinctly perforate at all stages of growth.
The upper liptooth is deeply placed and very oblique.
Viewed from the inside the spire and parietal wall removed it is seen to be a narrow oblique lamina.
There is no tubercle on the columella inside at least in the specimens I have opened.

In 1903 we took this species at eight places in Missouri Arkansas and Indian Territory.
It is quite abundant in most places and varies but slightly.
The recorded range of P. labrosa east of the Mississippi in Tennessee and Alabama see Bland rests solely upon data and specimens furnished by our conchological forefathers and no localities more definite than the States mentioned have been given.
It may be that the eastern range claimed for this species and Polygyra dorfeuilliana will prove to be without foundation in fact.
In the West its actually ascertained range is as foUows.
Except where otherwise stated we have examined specimens from the localities mentioned  Missouri Camden Benton Macdonald and Jasper counties Springfield Green Co.  Marble Cave near Galena Stone Co.

These localities are all in the hilly or mountainous country chiefly in central and western Arkansas barely reaching over the State border on the west but extending some distance north into Missouri.
Nowhere does the species approach the lowlands of the Mississippi so far as we know at present but we are still practically without data on the land moUuscan fauna of eastern Arkansas.
In his original description Bland mentioned four localities for P. labrosa Washita Springs and Hot Springs Ark. Tennessee and Alabama.'
As neither was designated as typical I would suggest that Hot Springs Garland Co. Ark. be selected as the type locality.
It has been collected there by Ferriss and others.

The range of the species indicated by these localities is a small area in the northern and northwestern outliers of the Ozark system about 200 miles in extent east and west and about 120 miles north and south.
Its distribution northward in Missouri remains to be determined  but southward in Arkansas and Indian Territory it probably does not range much farther for it would hardly have escaped the notice of Messrs. Sampson Simpson Ferriss and myself.
 Several specimens from Mammoth Spring Fulton Co. near the northern boundary of Arkansas are not quite typical yet are decidedly nearer to neglecta than to P. fraudulenta.
Whether P. neglecta will stand as a species or be reduced to the rank of a subspecies of P. fraudulenta remains to be seen when good collections from the intermediate region between its area and the Mississippi River can be examined.

This is a solid compact little Mesodon readily distinguished from P. binneyana and from the small umbilicate form of P. indianorum byits wide spire and narrower last whorl and by the very narrow expansion of the internally thickened lip which is without traces of teeth.
It was originally found at Kiowa and Limestone Gap I. T. two stations not towns on the M. K.  T. R. R. where Mr. C. T. Simpson collected in 1888.
A single bleached shell was taken at Eufaula I. T. In 1903 we worked a few days April 911 at and near the Gap and on the adjacent Sandstone Mountains immediately eastward.
Helices were found chiefly under stones together with copperheads and rattlesnakes.
We found P. kiowaensis very rare.

These specimens are somewhat more robust than the types of kiowaensis with the aperture slightly larger and the umbilicus smaller.
The specimens cohected by us at Magazine Mountain and Limestone Gap demonstrate however that the differences in the umbilicus and the shape of the mouth are inconstant  and we are now convinced that the varietal distinction is untenable.
The name arkansaensis should therefore be dropped.
The scarcity of specimens at the three widely separated localities known while many intermediate localities have been carefully searched for snails shows P. kiowaensis to be one of the rarest of American Helices.

This beautiful species is closely related to P. indianorum but is readily distinguished from the typical form of that species by its open umbilicus.
It is equally easy to separate it from P. kiowaensis by the larger aperture and comparatively narrower lip which is less thickened within and more reflexed.
It is found only on the mountains so far as our experience goes and chiefly under large stones.
It commonly does not seem to be found in the same localities with P. indianorum either the one or the other occupying the ranges where we collected in 1903.

At Limestone Gap on the line of the M. K.  T. R. R. we found P indianorum the commonest species though living ones were hard to get.
The shells are smaller than at Tushkahoma rarely over 22 mm.
diam. and about 60 per cent of the whole number taken have the umbilicus more or less open.
There is a perfect series of gradations from imperforate to as widely umbilicate as P. hinneyana only three shells of those found by Pilsbry were so open as this and as they were specially looked for the actual proportion is probably less than 3 per cent.
These umbilicate shells taken by themselves might be considered to be P. hinneyana were it not that they connect with imperforate indianorum by an unbroken series of intergrades and moreover even those most like hinneyana have the columella perceptibly more widely dilated.
It will be seen by the table of measurements that all the specimens from Limestone Gap plotted together would form a curve with two nearly equal strongly marked modes at the diameters 18 and 21 mm.
Separated into three series according to the condition of the umbilicus it is apparent that the imperforate typical form is larger than the perforate being from 18 to 22.5 mm.

This diminution of size correllated with a perforate or umbilicate axis may indicate that the Limestone Gap race is either undeveloped or retrogressive assuming maturity while yet retaining a character of the stage of youth in the unclosed axis  the best nourished largest individuals attaining the normal closed umbilicus while in those less favored the closure is imperfect and in only the most stunted snails is the umbilicus open.
A somewhat different view would be that the Limestone Gap series is in process of diverging to form two species one larger and imper1906.1 551 forate the other smaller and umbilicate  but as yet both characters intergrade and all the forms certainly occur together.

Several small series were taken in 1903 showing variations similar to those discussed in a former paper.
Aside from size the shells do not vary much.
The diameters are tabulated below for ten localities where we took the species in 1903.
Two large specimens from the north side of Magazine Mountain show a parietal tooth.
We do not remember seeing this tooth developed in the transMississippian race of albolabris hitherto.
The largest specimens were taken on steep damp and rocky northern slopes without reference to elevation.
At Wyandotte at an elevation of about 900 feet above the sea they Uve on the steep rocky bluff facing the river.
At Magazine Mountain the series of large shells came from the edges of the talus just under the great sandstone cliff along the northern side of the pleateau summit at an elevation of about 2700 feet while at an equal elevation on the dry south side with the same sort of rock and abundant cover the shells were small 25 mm.
diam. and at the base of the mountain still smaller 24.5 mm.
At Chadwick where the country rock is limestone the individuals are small 22 to 25 mm.
The size of individuals in this species and area seems to be dependent upon the abundance of cryptogamic food and is therefore a function of 1906.

91329 A. N. S. P. from Sugar Loaf Mt. Choctaw Nation I. T. collected by Pilsbry and Ferriss April 6 and 7 1903.
While readily distinguishable from typical P. zaleta or exoleta as it is commonly known this form has much in common with the race of northern Alabama such as Mr. H. E. Sargent found at Woodville.
In Woodville shells also the parietal tooth is very large and the size is ordinarily that of typical zaleta though occasional dwarf specimens are not larger than the Ozark race.
In fresh specimens of P. z. ozarkensis there is usually an appearance of angulation at the periphery in front though no actual angle exists.
The more elevated specimens might easily be mistaken for P. elevata which however differs by its columellar plate the irregular shape of the aperture and the more closely wound whorls.
Typical P. zaleta we have seen from Black Hawk Hollow Fort Madison Lee Co. Iowa T. Van Hyning but it has no extensive distribution in Iowa.
Binney reports it from Missouri but all the specimens before us from that State are the variety ozarkensis.
Binney specified no type locality for his Helix zaleta merely stating that it is  common in the States bordering on the Ohio river and in the western parts of Virginia and Pennsylvania.
In order to have a definite standard Cincinnati O. may be considered type locality specimens from that place agreeing well with his description and figures.
The following localities are now known for P. z. ozarkensis.

It would seem however that there is no difference in size between shells from the shady north side of the summit of INIagazine Mountain and those from its dry southern slope.
The Poteau Mountain and Petit Jean Mountain lots are from northern exposures but these mountains are rather dry.
The Sugar Loaf lot is from shady leafy ravines but not especially well watered or damp.
The snail however is not one which affects moist or rocky situations.
It lives preferably on slopes leaf carpeted over a rich humus and rolls out of the leaves where one is raking for Omphalina.
On the north side of Magazine Mountain we took them on the leafy slope just below the great rocktalus.

P. elevata seems to be a species which has penetrated only the northern edge of the Ozark region.
The specimens reported from Fort Gibson I. T. should be reexamined for they may prove to be P. z. ozarkensis a form easily mistaken for P. elevata.

The shell varies from imperforate to as widely perforate as G. demissa the periphery is well rounded in adults and the basal and outer walls of the aperture have a white callous lining showing yellow outside on the last third of the base the rest of the shell being olivaceous.
Young shells usually have at some stage of growth an entering callous lamella within the basal lip at the position of the similar lamella in G. gularis.

 distribution the Ozark uplift in Arkansas and adjacent portions of Missouri and Indian Territory.
This form has been much misunderstood and no fewer than five names have been applied to it.
It was not until the series collected by us in 1903 was studied that the problem reached solution.
In any good series from one place it is found that some shells possess the basal lamina within the mouth and that while these shells may be of various sizes they fall short of the maximum size of the toothless individuals found with them.
In the fully adult shells from any colony the lamina has always been absorbed so far as our experience goes.
But specimens of any size may also want the lamina so that the lamellate stage may be a transitory feature appearing sooner or later or possibly it may not be developed at all in some individuals.
In one lot of 24 shells from Hot Springs the largest one showing a lamina is 8.5 mm.
in diam. and the lamina is very low hardly noticeable.
All of the 7 from this size down to the smallest 5.5 mm.
are laminate most strongly so in the youngest.
None of the larger shells 16 individuals up to 10 mm.
diam.
show a lamina.
Fig 2 represents a series of these shells drawn to the same scale.
The types of G. brittsi were specimens just past the laminate stage but still immature.
In some colonies the laminate stage persists in somewhat larger shells than above indicated.
The size of the umbilical perforation varies and we do not now think that any racial distinction can well be based upon its variations.

G. d. hrittsi Hot Springs  series showing changes with growth X 4. subspecies differs from typical Eastern G. demissa chiefly by the usual development at some stage of the internal lamina whereas we have never seen this structure in any Eastern examples of the species.
G. d. hrittsi is a more primitive form than G. demissa and its chief claim to renown is that it supplies the link between the toothed Gastrodonts such as G. gularis and those without teeth G. acerra cerinoidea ligera and intertexta with which demissa has hitherto been associated.
When young G. d. hrittsi belongs to the dentate group but adults qualify to enter another class.
 Like the Gastrodonts of the Appalachians these Ozarkians vary interminably in minor features with locality.
At Magazine Mt. Logan Co. Ark. we took it sparingly at all elevations.

Only a few were taken none being of the laminate form.
The identification of this lot remains a little uncertain.

OBSEBVATIONS MADE IN 1906 ON GLACIERS IN ALBERTA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA.
BY GEORGE JR. AND WILLIAM S. VAUX.
At the present time the glaciers close to the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway located in the western part of Alberta and the eastern of British Columbia offer very convenient opportunities for study and comparison.
The most accessible examples are found on the western slopes of the Selkirk and Rocky Mountain ranges where they are fed by the immense precipitation from the warm winds blowing eastward from the Pacific Ocean.
In common with almost all glaciers throughout the world it is found that these are receding and while the changes between year and year are not great when the immense area of the glacier is considered in a decade or century sweeping differences must be noted.
That the general tendency for a great many years has been to recede every glacier in this region points with unmistakable evidence.
At no very remote date the Illecillewaet and Asulkan Glaciers met and flowed as one down the valley which is now shared in common by their streams while the beautiful Lake Louise more than 225 feet deep at the centre owes its existence to the dying Victoria Glacier which now extends only to within one and onehalf miles of the upper edge and is year by year depositing in the lake masses of glacier mud  ultimately to reduce it to a muskeg marsh.
Thus at every turn the life span of glacier mountain and lake may be read and the creating and destroying forces seen at work on every hand.
The much greater activity of glaciers located on the western slopes of the mountains as compared with those on the eastern has already been noted and it may also be observed that the snowfall on the higher ranges is greater than on the lower in corresponding positions even though the latter may lie farther to the west and consequently nearer to the origin of the moisturebearing winds from the Pacific Ocean.
The amount of precipitation of snow on the several mountain slopes and in the passes adjacent to the railway has always been a matter of much interest to those concerned in protecting the roadbed during the winter and also to students of glacier and alpine phenomena as by comparisons made over a long series of years interesting data of cause 1906.
569 and effect may be obtained.
Upon the completion of the railway records were started and have been kept with more or less regularity of the snowfall at three points near the summit of Roger's Pass on the western slope of the Selkirk Range.
While of course great variations have taken place and inaccuracies have crept in the summaries of daily measurements are here given as they have been preserved for three stations Cut Bank at an elevation of about 4000 feet Glacier House 4120 feet and No.

18 Shed 33 feet 8 inches while the average yearly snowfall taking into account all years observed since the winter of 1886 gives 27 feet 11 inches.
On the higher slopes and the neve regions of the glaciers in the vicinity the snowball is much greater yet the above may be taken fairly as an average for the elevation of Glacier House 4120 feet or a little below the tongue of the Illecillewaet Glacier.
In the following pages no attempt will be made to describe the peculiar phenomena of the several glaciers upon which measurements have been made but to briefly outline the observations made during the last two weeks of July 1906 together with sufficient description of the work which has gone before to provide data for comparisons.
570 proceedings of the academy of dec Illecillewaet Glacier.
Glacier House British Columbia.
Being the most accessible of any of this group the Illecillewaet Glacier has been observed yearly since 1898.
Prior to that time beginning in 1887 the observations have been made with less regularity. The work may be divided under three heads each of which will be treated separately as follows  Test Pictures.
 These have been made each year beginning August 17 1898 from the marked rock W. From this point a complete view of the tongue and lower glacier may be had and of a part of the icefall almost up to the limit of the dry glacier.
The same camera and lens being used and exactly the same position selected the pictures indicate very accurately the changes which have taken place in any given interval.
A careful study of these shows that in spite of the continued recession of the tongue and a general shrinkage of the ice at the edges particularly at the left side where great masses have broken away uncovering waterworn bedrock the thickness of the ice at the sky line is appreciably thicker than it was in 1898.
This condition has been noted for a number of years and time alone will prove whether an advance will take place when the thicker mass reaches the icefall and tongue.
There is no doubt however that in all other particulars  breadth depth and extension of tongue  the glacier is at present from year to year decreasing.
A comparison of the two test pictures of 1902 and 1906 reproduced herewith with that made in 1898 compare Plate V Proc.
Acad.

Phila. 1899 will show in detail the changes which have taken place.
'p Recession of Tongue.
 As previously noted Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila. 1899 p. 124 the first accurate location of the tongue of the ice is to be found in a long flat boulder not far from the moraine of 1887 S. on the map lettered by unknown hands ''16 feet to nearest ice '90.
With this rock as a basis the glacier showed a retreat after eight years onAugust 17 1898 of 452 feet.
From 1898 to the past summer 1906 the annual change has been determined from a rock marked C. on map lying in the centre of the bed moraine and which on August 17 1898 was 60 feet from the tongue of the ice.
The following table shows the recession each year and the date on which the measurements were made. '

July 241906 It is interesting to note that while the recession between 1890 and 1898 showed an average of 56 feet per year for the eight years from 1898 to 1906 this average has been but 33.3 feet per year or about threefifths.
It will also be observed by reference to the map that the measurement on July 24 1906 was not made to the point of greatest extension in the ice.
Should this point have been measured the course would not have been in the same line as previous years the tongue having moved to the left but the recession for the year ending in 1906 would have been 64 feet instead of 84 feet as noted in the table.
The change noted between any two years is not a good indication of the amount of recession or advance which may have taken place as the local weather conditions rainfall and even the condition of the crevasses above all have a marked influence in determining changes and it is only when these are eliminated by including a longer interval that the true amount of change may be determined.
Flow of Glacier above Tongue.
 In 1899 to determine the rate of flow of the ice at a point about 1300 feet above the tongue eight plates were laid out across the glacier.
These were accurately placed by means of a transit in a true line almost at right angles to the direction of flow and their change in position accurately determined after stated intervals.
The positions of these plates have been plotted on the map and the table on page 572 gives a summary of the changes that have taken place at the times noted.
With the exception of the comparisons made between July 31 and September 5 1899 see first part of table page 574 the motion indicates the movement of the glacier over the period of approximately a year and thus includes both the summer flow which should be greater and the winter flow which should be less than the averages given.
Several of the 1899 plates have been lost from one cause or another.

In 1906 an entirely new set of six plates was prepared and on July 12 they were laid out on the exact line used in 1899 see map.
Some defects having been found in the first plates the ones laid out this year were of different design.
A lighter steel reduced the weight by onehalf without decreasing efficiency while the pipe caulk was dispensed with entirely a hold in the ice being obtained by turning the right edge up onehalf inch and the left edge down a like amount.
The plate was thus held in position on the ice should it turn over.
It is made up of but one piece and may be nested compactly for carrying.
Steel oneeighth inch thick was used 6 inches by 7 inches which was left 6 inches square after the edging up had been completed.
A trial showed that the thinner plate allowing greater melting of the ice beneath formed a pocket in which the plate rested almost entirely free from slipping even on the steeper slopes.
Each plate was marked VAUX 1906 in white on a red lead background.
The plates laid out were numbered from 1 to 6 beginning on the right side of the glacier.
The aim of this investigation was to compare the yearly rate of flow at the line laid out with the yearly changes in the position of the tongue and to determine the effect which a change in one would have on the other.
As the second series of plates have been in position but a short time no yearly comparisons can be made but the following table comparing the daily motion of the plates in the fall of 1899 compare Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila. 1899 p. 507 with the motion of those in 1906 will give a ratio of the summer motion between the two dates.
The plates have been grouped according to their location on the glacier the numbers in the two instances bearing no relation to each other.
The great uncertainty of this work may be realized when it is noted that in 1906 during twelve days the surface conditions of the glacier changed completely.
Crevasses opened others closed and plates which when laid out were on comparatively level ice were found to be in almost inaccessible positions Avhich took long detours from the main path to reach.
The interval between the laying out and measuring of the plates was one of unusual heat.
Great freshets were reported all through the district every glacier stream was swollen to abnormal size and evidences of great surface melting were everjhere apparent.
In addition to locating the position of the plates a crosssection of the surface of the glacier at this point was developed.
A comparison 574 Dec of this area with that similarly plotted in 1899 shows a marked shrinkage in the surface of the ice at that point.

This glacier lying at the head of the Asulkan Valley some three miles from Glacier House in British Columbia has been observed with more or less regularity since 1899 compare Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila. 1899 p. 504.
At that time rocks were marked and the general aspect of the tongue and moraines noted.
Photographs have also been made which show the yearly changes in extension thickness and breadth.
The work on this glacier in 1906 covered practically the same ground as on the Illecillewaet and may be similarly divided.
Test Pictures.
 An almost continuous record of photographs of the lower section has been made since 1899 from a large flat rock several hundred feet below the glacier which affords a view of all parts.
A comparison of these photographs taken over a series of years shows smaller changes than in the cases of some of the neighboring glaciers but that they are of the same character  a general shrinkage and reduction of section area compare Plates XXV and XXVI with Plate VI Proc.
Acad.

Phila. 1899.
Changes in the Tongue.
 On the left side the Asulkan Glacier is bearing a large amount of morainal material which is deposited at the lower part of the left edge and upon the tongue.
The right side is comparatively free from moraine except stray erratics which are borne on the surface of the ice and deposited at the edge.
Several small moraines on the bed moraine indicate that at one time the amount of this material was much greater than at present.
For several years the tongue has been deeply bedded in moraine and was difficult to locate.
During the period of slight advance which was first noted in 1903 a steep moraine was pushed up at the tongue and the stream forced to find an exit through a smaller moraine on the right.
The present year however 1906 the tongue occupied almost exactly the same position as in 1899 leaving a space between the ice and the moraine which was formed during the glacier advance.
A considerable stream issues directly beneath the tongue and almost covering the 1899 test rock has broken through the high unstable moraine.
The following table shows the changes in the tongue as observed since 1899.

The Flow of Glacier above Tongue.
 For this work a line was selected across the glacier about 1250 feet above the tongue and as nearly as possible at right angles to the line of flow.
Owing to the comparatively short distances and the ease of observation no base line was laid down except as a check and the positions of the plates from the points of observation were determined by means of the stadia.
The motion of the plates on the ice was in every case measured with a horizontal steel tape at right angles to the base line.
Plates numbered 7 to 12 similar to those used on the Illecillewaet Glacier were laid out on July 13 1906 and their motion determined on July 23.
The following table shows the total and average daily motion of the plates and of a very large oblong bowlder resting on the top of the moraine on the left edge of the glacier and advancing with it.

If question is raised as to the accuracy of the stadia method for this class of work it may be noted that in every instance the motion of plates and recession were determined from measurements with a standard tape and it was found that over rough ground and glacier surfaces work could be greatly expedited by use of the stadia with an error not so great as would be encountered on the necessarily small scale of the plotting map.
Wenkchemna Glacier.
Valley of the Ten Peaks Laggan Alberta.
In some respects this glacier presents the most unusual aspect of any noted in the region.
Of the piedmont type its neve receives snow which falls and is blown across the Wenkchemna Group or ' ' The Ten Peaks ' ' and falls into the couloirs and chimneys lying on the northern slopes.
At the lower levels a number of comparatively small glaciers are formed flowing almost due north across the southern half of the Valley of the Ten Peaks.
The valley bottom in places is covered with an open forest of firs and spruces the Lyell larch being found in abundance at the upper western end where an elevation of over 7000 feet is reached.
At the head of the valley several almost parallel lines of ancient moraines were noted and distinct traces of them could be followed down the valley till they were finally lost in the streameroded bottom.
These moraines and the very interesting one at the lower end of Moraine Lake which has given it its existence and name point clearly to the fact that the glacier at one time covered the entire bottom of the valley and that the medial moraines which are now noted between the several sections of the glacier were at that time carried entirely on its back down the valley and deposited far below without leaving any trace of the route which had been originally taken.
It has been known for a number of years that some portions of the Wenkchemna Glacier were advancing or rather that from time to time masses of moraine which had rested almost upon the limit of the ice had been shot down upon and partly or completely covered living trees of the forest which in places comes directly up to the ice wall.
A comparison of photographs taken in previous years with the conditions as they were found in July 1906 indicated that at the points in question no material advance of the ice could have taken place and yet at these very points there was evidence of masses of moraine being projected on the ground below.
The fresh rock was thrown beyond the limit of the ice which to all observation had not changed recently.
The base of the glacier close to the ground gave evidence of not having changed for a number of years but from the ice slope above masses of rock were and had been precipitated over and beyond the older rocks and upon the grass and trees.
A careful consideration of these unusual conditions seemed to offer but one satisfactory solution.
The ice forming this glacier or rather composite glacier is largely contained in a hollow or basin from the bottom of which drainage is provided to the lake below.
The ice extends above the edges of the basin in many places covered deeply with moraine.
The pressure upon the ice from behind causes a slow but steady motion of the upper strata towards the edges which sets up a shearing action of one layer of ice on that below.
The result is that the upper part of the moraine very thin and unable to withstand the pressure is pushed outward by the ice till it falls over the edge of the lower and more stable portions and upon the green grass or forest beyond the limits of the basin.
It is evident that this action is much more active at certain points than at others and an attempt was made to determine whether the position of the edge had anything to do with it without satisfactory results.
Wliatever may finally be determined as to the cause of change in tne ice edge a tramp over the glacier surface gave many evidences of great and continued shrinkage.
The moraines everywhere showed that though they had been recently formed the ice was then many feet thicker and a series of very beautiful rock cones which rested on the solid ground but were surrounded by ice bore silent witness to the immense thickness of the ice in recent times compared with what is noted at present.
Victoria Glacier.
Lake Louise Laggan Alberta.
Almost as accessible as the lUecillewaet the Victoria Glacier has never received the same careful study owing in large measure to the immense moraines which bury the tongue and the almost impossible task of finding permanent base and line ends.
The great boulder marked in 1899 and which the next season had moved with the ice 147 feet has not since been measured but the position of the ice on the northwest side referred to several large angular blocks of red quartzite has been repeatedly determined.
During the summer of 1898 these blocks slipped from the ice and fell to the moraine below.
On July 29 1899 they were 20 feet from the ice  on July 24 1900 26 feet showing a change of 6 feet for the year on September 1 1903 76 feet 6 inches or an average yearly shrinkage of almost 17 feet while on July 30 1906 the distance was but 74 feet 7 inches showing practically no change as the early date of measiuement in 1906 compared with 1903 would make considerable difference in the total figures.
Wapta or Yoho Glacier.
YoHO Valley Near Field British Columbia.
This glacier located at the head of the Yoho Valley is a very long day's trip from Field the station on the railway.
On August 17 1901 the position of the tongue was marked on a large mass of bedrock which had been recently uncovered by the ice.
The tongue at this time was a narrow blade of ice somewhat to the left of the axis of the glacier and lying in a long deep groove between parallel ledges of rock.
Three years later the change was measured on August 7 1904 as 89 feet or an average yearly recession of almost 30 feet.
At this time there were signs of great activity and marked shrinkage.
On July 15 1906 almost a month earlier in the season than on the occasion of the previous visit the glacier was again observed and the distance measured as 76 feet 7 inches or about 12 feet less than in 1904.
Allowing for the earlier date it may be said that the tongue is in the same position as two years ago.
The general aspect of the ce showed that it was shrinking and retreating and this was particularly the case on the right side where the main stream debouches from a most beautiful ice arch.
Horseshoe Glacier.
Paradise Valley Laggan Alberta.
Although no marks have been placed on this glacier it offers some striking and unique points of interest.
It is of the piedmont type and owes its existence to the snow avalanches from Mounts Hungabee Ringrose Lefroy and Mitre to the north of which it lies.
The tongue and lower portions are deeply buried in moraine.
While in common with others there are indications of shrinkage and retreat the protection of moraine on the surfaces renders these changes very slow.
An exceedingly interesting phenomenon was noticed at a point several hundred feet above the tongue where a great sinuous canon has been worn in the ice.
The sides were perpendicular or overhanging from 20 to 30 feet in depth while the curves were 1000 to 1500 feet long.
In all there were not less than ten great bends and through the bottom a goodsized stream flowed.
The walls exhibited very fine examples of banding while all the surfaces were fluted horizontally apparently due to the greater melting in summer than in winter.
Should this be correct the caiion has been at least twelve years in forming.
From the foregoing data it is hard to draw more than the most general conclusions.
It may however be safely noted that in all the glaciers observed there has been decided shrinkage and recession in the past seven years.
While changes in the position of the tongue may have been small the ice mass and sectional area are evidently much less.
On the other hand the average yearly recession was in 1906 less than during a similar period five years before the exception in the lUecillewaet Glacier being probably due to unusual conditions.
The trifling advances in the Asulkan Glacier may be attributed to local causes and have no particular significance but the increased daily rate of flow of the IlleciUewaet coupled with a thickening of the ice at the sky line as seen from the test rock would seem to point to a period of greater activity in the not very distant future.
The following reports were ordered to be printed  REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY.
Sixteen meetings of the Academy were held during the past year with an average attendance of fiftytwo.

Three of these were returned to the authors the others were accepted for publication in the Proceedings of which one number for 1905 and two for 1906 have been issued and distributed.
Seven hundred and fifteen pages of the Proceedings have been published illustrated by fifteen plates.
The Entomological Section has published four hundred and four pages with fifteen plates of the Entomological News and two hundred and fortyseven pages with five plates of the Transactions of the American Entomological Society Entomological Section of the Academy.
Two hundred and seventytwo pages with thirtyfour plates have been issued of the Manual of Conchology.
This makes a total of sixteen hundred and thirtyeight pages and sixtynine plates published during the year under the auspices of the Academy.
The President was appointed to represent the Academy at the celebration by the American Philosophical Society of the two hundredth anniversary of the birthdaof Benjamin Franklin.
A satisfactoiy design for the new Haydeii Memorial Iedal has at last been submitted and approved.
The artist has been engaged on the work since September 1905.
Whether the time that has elapsed has been due to the eccentricities of the artistic temperament or a press of other engagements is not known but it is believed that the beauty of the result will compensate for the delay.
The new medal will certainly be a great improvement on the one awarded since 1890 the portrait of Hayden on the obverse being much more accurate than could have been hoped for from the photographs available while the design of the reverse replacing the unsatisfactory view of the Grand Canon is gracefully emblematic.
The die will it is hoped be promptly engravedso that the medalso long due may be conveyed to Dr.Walcott.
Mr. Fox has rendered effective assistance in the issue and distribution of the Proceedings.

It is hoped that in a year or so the arrearages will have received such attention that the appropriations for bindings may be largely decreased.
In compliance with the action of the Council of the Academy 1318 volumes were sent to the California Academy of Sciences to assist in repairing the loss inflicted by earthquake and fire on the 18th of last April.
The collection included a nearly complete set of the ProceedJNGS and Journal of the Academy bound and in common with the other volumes appropriately labelled so as to indicate the source and object of the gift.
A letter of acknowledgment recently received conveys the assurance that the books will be an important assistance to the California Academy the members of which in common with all the people of San Francisco displayed such superb courage and fortitude under an almost overwhelming affliction.
The boxes were sent to California through the Smithsonian Institution.
Many duplicates received from corresponding societies had for years been accumulating in the Library of the Academy.
After a selection had been sent to the California Academy the Library Committee and the Council directed the return of the remainder to the publishing societies in the hope that a similar favor might be secured in the case of duplicates of the Academy's publications.
Parcels therefore have been sent through the International Bureau of Exchange to 215 societies each accompanied by the following notice The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia returns duplicates of publications received from corresponding societies and requests that duplicate numbers of its Journal and Proceedings be returned either by post or through the International Bureau of Exchange.
It is hoped that this action may result in an addition to the stock of the earlier issues of the Academj's publications several of which are nearly out of print.
Seventyeight volumes and 256 pamphlets pubUcations of the Department of Agriculture U. S. Geological Survey Bureau of Education etc. have been returned to the Government Printing Office in compliance with the law.
The greater number of these were duplicates but some were works not pertinent to the Academy's Library.
About thirtyseven volumes belonging to the latter class were given to the Free Library of Philadelphia.
Cards have been prepared to be placed in the spaces left by books kept in the study rooms for use thus in a measure remedying the inconvenience arising from such retention.
The necessity for additional room in some of the departments of the Library becomes annually more pressing.
In view of the possibility of an increase of the Academy's building in the near future certain of the additions are placed temporarily not always in conformity with the system of classification in the hope that the required increase in the shelving capacity of the Library may be secured.
Ten cases are still to be shelflisted in the department of Journals and Periodicals although the work has continued during the yearas steadily as the time at the disposal of the Assistant would permit.
Three hundred and thirtynine lantern sHdes have been added to the collection as a loan from the Ludwick Institute.
These are distinguished in the catalogue by blue cards.
The intelligence and reliability of my assistant William J.
Fox in the discharge of his duties both in the Librarjand in connection with the publications of the Academy are again gladly acknowledged.
Edward J. Nolan Librarian.
REPORT OF THE CURATORS.
The collections in the care of the Curators are in excellent condition while much progress has been made during the year in their study and classification.
Early in the year work was begun upon the new concrete and steel roof for the Library building for which the Academy received an appropriation of S20000 from the State of Pennsylvania and by the beginning of the autumn it had been completed.
The new roof is a needed improvement being thoroughly waterproof and fireproof while it admits an abundance of light to the Museum galleries.
This work necessitated the temporary closing of the old luseum to the public and the removal of all the collections from the upper gallery while the cases on the lower floor had to be boarded up for their better protection.
The rearrangement of the collections is now in progress and will be pushed rapidly during the coming year.
Two thousand and sixteen cubic feet of exhibition cases uniform with those previously installed have been ordered for birds invertebrate fossils and the McCook collection of insect architecture.
A number of airtight metal storage cases have been provided for the bird and mammal skins and for the Herbarium.
Mr. Clarence B. Moore has continued his exploration of the Indian mounds of the Gulf States and has still further enriched his unrivalled collection.
Through the liberality of Mrs. Charles Schaeffer Mr. Stewardson Brown was enabled to spend two months collecting botanical specimens in the Canadian Rockies where he obtained about 4000 plants representing 700 species.
Dr. Henry Skinner visited Idaho in the interest of the Academy for the purpose of making entomological collections hut a serious attack of illness materially interfered with his work.
Dr. H. A. Pilsbry spent October and November in the prosecution of his studies on the molluscan fauna of Arizona.
In addition to these extended expeditions many local collecting trips have been undertaken by the members of the Museum staff and much valuable material secured.
Among the more notable accessions to the Museum during the year may be mentioned the Gulick collection of Hawaiian mollusks which formed the basis of Mr. Gulick's wellknown paper on Evolution Racial and Habitudinal the collection of bird skins formed by the late Canon Tristram of Durham England representing over 3000 species from all parts of the world a large proportion of them new to the Academy's collection and another valuable collection of marine invertebrates from Naples presented by Dr. Henry C. Chapman.
A nimiber of valuable mammals received from the Zoological Society of Philadelphia or by purchase have been mounted by the taxidermist and many others prepared as skins or skeletons.
Considerable additions have been made to the alcoholic series in Herpetology.
In addition to the services rendered by the Museum staff the Curators are indebted to Dr. P. P. Calvert Messrs. E. T. Cresson Jr. and H. W. Wenzel for aid in the Entomological department and to Mr. S. S. Van Pelt in the Herbarium.
Details of the year's work in several departments are appended.
In addition Dr. J. P. Moore has continued the care and study of the Helminthological collections and Mr. H. W. Fowler of the Fishes while Miss H. N. Wardle has made progress in cataloguing and arranging the Archseological collections.
The AntiTuberculosis Society Philadelphia Botanical Club and Delaware Valley Ornithological Club have held their meetings in the Academy during the year.
The collections have been consulted by many visiting scientists and specimens have been loaned to Robert Ridgway H. W. Henshaw H. L Smith.

Report of the Special Curator of the Department of Mollusca.
Early in the year the entire collection of mollusks was removed from the upper gallery and has remained packed up during the construction of the new roof of the Museum.
New cases have now been ordered which will enable us to rearrange the specimens during the coming year.
Meanwhile work has been continued upon such parts of the collection as were accessible.
Large accessions have been received from numerous correspondents of the Curator.
A list of these gifts may be found in the accessions to the Museum.
The largest single accession has been the collection of Hawaiian land snails purchased from Dr. John T. Gulick.
This series served as the basis of that author's important studies on evolution as well as his systematic papers on the Hawaiian fauna.
Mr. H. Bloomfield Moore has contributed largely to our series of small land mollusks of Georgia and Florida by gatherings of leaves and humus from which large mnnbers of shells have been picked by Mr. Vanatta.
The Special Curator has been occupied chiefly with the preparation of the Manual of Conchology the monograph of the family Achatinidce being completed this year and the collections of this group revised and relabelled.
Studies of American and Japanese mollusks have also been continued.
The months of October and November were spent in Arizona and New Mexico chiefly in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado the Florida and Chiricahua Mountains and large collections of the mollusca of these regions were obtained.
Mr. E. G. Vanatta has continued his efficient work as Assistant in the department throughout the year.
H. A. PiLSBRY Special Curator.

The Ornithological Section.
During the past year the remainder of the mounted birds with the exception of the song birds and ostriches were removed to the new building and placed in the cases provided for them all of the specimens 592 Dec. being examined by the taxidermist and thoroughly cleansed.
Three new cases to accommodate the groups above mentioned are now nearly completed so that the arrangement of the new bird gallery will be finished at an early date.
Ten additional cases have been procured for the study series of skins which is increasing at a rapid rate and is much consulted.
During the past year the Academy secured by purchase the collection of bird skins belonging to the late Canon Tristram of Durham England.
This comprises about 7000 specimens representing some 3000 species the avifauna of British Guiana and of various insular groups being particularly well represented.
Altogether it forms one of the most notable accessions that has been made to the Ornithological department and brings the total number of specimens in the Academy's collection close to 55000 while it adds a large number of forms previously unrepresented in our series.
Several nests and sets of eggs have been added to the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club Collection rendering this local exhibit still more nearly complete.
The Club has held its meetings in the building of the Academy during the year and its members as well as many visiting ornithologists have studied the collections.
Mr. J.
A. G. Rehn has rendered important service during the year in cataloguing and arranging the accessions.
