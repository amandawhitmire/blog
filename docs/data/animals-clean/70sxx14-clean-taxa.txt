Mollusca OF THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES IX THE SANTA CATALINA RINCON TORTILLITA AND GALIURO MOUNTAINS.
X THE MOUNTAINS OF THE GILA HEADWATERS.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND JAS.
H. FERRISS. The Santa Catalina in Pima County north of Tucson is one of the large ranges of Southern Arizona about fortyfive miles in length including its Tanque Vercle and Rincon outliers with an extreme width of twentyfive miles.
Mount Lemon with an elevation of 9150 feet is heavily forested with yellow pine quaking asp cork bark fir Abies arizonica Douglas spruce Pseudotsuga mucronata cypress Cupressus arizonica other coniferous trees large oaks and an alder as tall as a pine.
The male fern and the brake stand here four feet in height.
The Douglas spruce are eight feet in diameter.
There is a forest gloom at midday and a ground covering indicating a timber growth of many years without interruption by fires or lumbering.
Winter often brings ten feet of snow.
With numerous trout streams it has the attractions summer and winter of the deep forests along the Canadian border without their annoying insects.
In quantity and number of species of the smaller snails the north slope of Mount Lemon has the best record so far.
The odorshooting roughcoated Sonorellaalso is here in large numbers under the fallen bark of the Douglas spruce and the dead poles of the quaking asp and cork bark fir.
Unlike his brethren with a polished coat this snail seeks food and cover similar to those used by the Polygyras of timbered areas in the Mississippi valley and eastward.
The humid forest conditions of the region around Lemon Mountain prevail at Soldier Camp Kellogg's Peak Alder Canyon Alder Springs.
The Spud Rock Ranger Station and other high peaks of the Rincon section except in lacking cork bark fir also follow Mount Lemon closely in forest conditions.
They have the large oaks and conifers the quaking asp and the heavy floor of humus underfoot but not quite as many snails.
In the valleys of Bear Wallow and Sabino creeks at the heart of the Santa Catalinas the Arizonians of lower and hotter levels have 1 The field work covered by this report was by Ferriss assisted in the Blue River region and the MogoUon Mountains by the late L. E. Daniels.
built villages of summer cottages.
It is about a full day's journey from Tucson on horseback.
A small saw mill furnishes building material for this summer society for a sanitarium now under construction and for the copper mines over the ridge at the foot of Marble Peak.
Except in the vallej of the San Pedro river and the village of Oracle onty a few miners ranch men and forest rangers are to be found in all this group of ranges.
There are more bears and mountain lions than people.
The southern slopes of the Catalinas the foot hills and mesas and the Galiuro and Tortillita ranges are not heavily forested.
At best it is low open woods or desert shrubbery through which the granite rocks and precipices glisten in the sun.
The soil is dry though often covered with fallen leaves and growing vegetation.
A few Sonorella and some of the smaller snails may be found at all altitudes in the rock slides the talus on all sides of the mountain and in any kind of rock especially smooth and stratified rock sometimes also under fallen timber or in small piles of boulders.
In the dry season among dry and hot rocks dead shells will be the rule.
Here one must dig a full eight hour day for a live one.
We find a twofoot bar of half inch octagonal steel very helpful.
The bar should have a twoinch chisel edge flattened out at each end one of these turned at a right angle like a hoe.
It will weigh one and threequarter pounds a good digger a jimmy for rock work and a helpful staff in steep and rough places.
Sonorellais something of a rambler moreso than Ashmunella or Oreohelix and upon damp days scouts may be met out in the fallen leaves far from their rocky homes.
Often single dead lie along the trails where there is no shelter in the vicinity for snail kind.
In 1913 on the south side of the Santa Catalinas in the dry season day after day but one or two living Sonorella were found.
It was the same about Brush Corral Ranger Station on the north side in the rocky slides of the canyons nearly on a level with the river.
In one of these slides of three or more feet in depth three hundred good bones were found but none alive.
It was also the same kind of collecting in the Gahuros and the Tortillitas in the winter of 191718.
A small deep slide of porphyry or shale shaded partially with rose bushes elder or gooseberry bushes makes an ideal home for the Southwestern snails.
The Galiuro range in Graham County and the Tortillita range in Pinal County as yet unsurveyed seem to have an elevation of about 7000 or 8000 feet granite or other igneous rock prevailing and with but a little timber.
A few ledges of sharppointed limestone dolomite probably had no attraction for the snails.
The entire region at present is inaccessible except to horsemen and pedestrians and these should carry their own food and shelter.
We did and lived like kings before the war.
One of us Ferriss collected a few days less than a week in the Santa Catalinas Mount Lemon and Soldier Camp in 1910 again much of the time from May to October in 1913 on the southern slope around Mount Lemon Soldier Camp IVIarble Peak and on the northern mesa about Brush Corral.
Again a month was spent in 1917 at Sabino Basin Bear Creek and Brush Corral the Rincon Peaks and the Galiuros.
The guide Frank Cole on a hunting trip brought in Sonorella from the Tortillitas and from the Canada del Oro section of the Santa Catalinas.
Many inviting prospects in these mountains remain neglected.
They surely contain species still unknown.
Life is rapid in snaildom decay a slow irocess in an arid climate and possibly these fat cemeteries in the basements of Sonorellaslides merely represent the natural death rate of many years.
It may be that one living inhabitant to one hundred skeletons is the right proportion.
However an impression grows upon the collector as he digs in the arid foothills that in earlier times there were periods or seasons more favorable to snail life  seasons with more moisture more vegetation and a deeper humus.
The steep mountain gulches with walls on either side thrown above the surrounding surface quite plainly speak of days when the floods were greater than any known in modern times.
These boulder bulwarks contain potsherds and other evidence of human occupation also Sonorella.
As collecting grounds they are often preferable to the large slides farther up the mountain.
Among these boulders in the hot sunlight we found the largest Sonorella
Measured crudely in the field it had a diameter of 33 millimeters.
In collecting Sonorella and Oreohelices from arid to humid zones in the same canjon or mountain one gets the impression that the differences of size are mainly a matter of the breed that they are racial rather than due to length of growing season supply of food or climatic comforts.
We naturally search ideal environments of food shade and shelter for robust races and expect to meet the pigmy forms in hot dry and barren places.
Often what we find is the reverse of this.
On one climb in 1918 at Kitt's Peak a large and robust Sonorellawas found at a low elevation in a barrier of boulders so dry and barren the snails would necessarily lie dormant a large part of the year.
At a thousand feet higher beside a stream of running water came in a much smaller breed and 1500 feet above number two with an ideal situation as to a moist atmosphere food shelter and snail comfort lived a pigmy Sonorellaof about 12 millimeters in diameter.
Again on the Kaibab Plateau in 1909 every colony of Oreohelix Mrigosa depressa seemed a little different from all other colonies.
At Two Spring Canyon with running water all the way the pigmies were at the higher station in a grove of quaking asp.
Every colony increased in size and color brilliance at a regular pace down the canjon.
Here seemed proof positive of the advantage of a longer growing season.
Over the ridge in Snake Gulch the order was reversed for the larger shells were at the top in a dry situation and their size seemingly decreased in proportion to the mileage as we descended along a running stream.
In Jacobs Canyon running parallel to Snake Gulch dry all the way the large and gaudy shells Avere midway the smaller and paler above and below.
Food conditions may have had some influence in the development of these races but if so the evidence was not apparent.
In the field we meet contradictions continually beyond our understanding but perhaps we may have a better comprehension before the survey of the Southwest is completed.

Rincons at station 22 Spud Rock Ranger Station and Station 20 on the north slope.
It lives in deep humid forest in colonies as our eastern helices do under logs and bark of quaking asp and Arizona fir sometimes by dozens.
Only at Spud Rock it was found deep in rocks also humid.
It is a timber snail of the Canadian zone forest.
In general aspect the shell reminds one of the Calif ornian helices.
This is a common snail in the heavily wooded upper levels of the Santa CataUnas taken at many stations.
When picked up it emits a strong unpleasant odor recalling that of the goldenrod of Thunderhead mountain in East Tennessee probabl Solidago odora
This was first noticed at Kellogg Peak.
When picked up the snail shot out two or three drops of liquid six inches or more evidently expelled from the lung as the foot is retracted.
One often smelled them before finding any.
But three or four shells broken by mice or squirrels were noticed in the course of collecting and it may be that the snaileaters object to the smell.
By the genitalia this species is related to S. clappi of the Santa Rita range and S. ferrissi of the Dragoons though differing from iDoth in several details.
The shell is most like S. clappi.
It differs from other Santa Catalina species by the minute granulation of the surface which gives it a dull silky luster.
The color is rather variable.

Specimens from the Rincons Station 22 1917 are pale cinnamon or greenish above fading to a pale bluishgray on the base the band with narrow indistinct paler borders or without them.
The lip is conspicuously brownedged.
The umbilicus is generally wider than in the Catalina shells.
One perfect shell and another broken one in this lot are albinos or at least the tint is very pale and there is no band.
These shells are found deep in a rock slide in a quaking asp thicket.
At Station 20 1917 on the northern slope of the Rincons two dead but fresh shells were found in a day's search.

The shell is readily separable from odorata and perhaps it should be considered a separate species.
It has the same peculiar odor.

We have tried in vain to use these characters for a separation of the series some hundreds of shells but while the extremes in size of aperture appear quite distinct the distinction could not be carried through as nearly every station supplied individuals with large intermediate and small apertures.
The specimens from low in Sabino canyon usually have more solid thicker shells than those from higher but this is not always the case.
It is a species of the arid mountains confined to lower elevations than S. marmorarius.

There is considerable variation in the shells from Buehman canyon in size degree of elevation and number of whorls yet unless anatomical differences are found we consider them all of one race.
As yet only the typical form has been dissected.
Specimens from Station 41 1913 from the head of Sycamore Gulch have the umbilicus slightly more open than in typical buehmanensis and the borders of the shoulderband are paler thus approaching the larger forms of S. sabinoensis.
In Stations 42 and 43 the size varies widely and the smaller specimens have only a fraction of a whorl more than sabinoensis from which they differ by the smaller aperture.

They are smaller and more solid than S. rinconensis and the umbilicus is somewhat smaller.
It is more depressed and has a wider umbilicus than S. sabinoensis.
In color and surface it resembles the latter species.

The status of the form is uncertain but it can scarcely be linked with any of the Santa Catalina or Rincon species so that while we do not like to describe a Sonorellawithout examination of the soft anatomy there seems nothing else to do in this case.
Its status may be revised when living examples come to hand.

P. h. nefas almost always has a small parietal tooth and is usually a little longer than P. hebes with between 6 and 7 whorls.
It differs from P. syngeyies by having no crest behind the lip though there is usually a shallow wide depression there.
In onty one of the numerous stations mentioned above were hebes and nefas found together.
That was Station 22 where verj' few shells were taken.
Lots from all of the other stations frequently copious were either all hebes or all nefas.
Elsewhere P. h. nefas has been found only in two places in the Chiricahua Mountains at elevations estimated from 7500 to 8000 ft.
It was not associated there with dextral hebes which was found at another Chiricahua locality.
We are now disposed to rank P. h. nefas as a wellmarked subspecies.

There is a narrow but moderately high erest close behind the outer lip.
The color is chestnutbrown becoming paler towards the apex.
When alive both animal and shell are black.
Teeth fine a small supraparietal denticle being developed.
The parietal and lower palatal folds are rather large.

In the original V. c. basidens from Bland New Mexico there is one parietal tooth and the basal is at the foot of the columella remote from the lower palatal.
In the Santa Catalina series there is often a small angular lamella and the basal fold stands close to the lower palatal.
This form replaces V. c. basidens in the Canadian zone of the Santa Catalinas.
The type is from Bear Wallow.

V. c. inserta differs from V. c. arizonensis by the development of a basal fold and all of the teeth are larger.
Recent studies of the group have convinced us that Vertigo Columbiana utahensis Sterki is identical with V. coloradensis Ckll.
The former name is therefore superfluous.
Our record of V. c. iitahensis from the Chiricahua Mountains in these Proceedings for 1910 p. 144 should be changed to V. coloradensis.
ANCYLID Gundlachia californica Rowell.
Santa Catalina Mountains Sabino Canyon at Alkali Spring Lowell U. S. Ranger Station on leaves of Plantinus wrighti.
Very few examples are in the Gundlachia stage none were found in the septate stage.
Many have the narrow high obhque shape of septates but without septum.
Many of them reached the normal size of septates then had a resting stage during which the shell became blackened subsequently resuming growth along the margins forming a narrow oblique shell somewhat like A. parallelus in outline.
Other examples become wider about as in A. rivularis in the second period of growth.
The early stages are similar in all having the usual Ferrissia sculpture.
Those individuals in the Gundlachia stage do not appear specfically separable from G. callfornica.

X  Mountains of the Gila Headwaters The Blue and White Mountains Arizona and the Mogollon Mountains New Mexico.
The malacological survey of these ranges which lie in Graham Apache and Greenlee counties Arizona and Socorro count New Mexico was begun by one of us Ferriss in 1913 and continued by Ferriss and L. E. Daniels in 1914.
In 1900 Dr. E. O. Wooten well known for his work on New Mexican botany made a tenday trip in the Mogollons in course of which he crossed the range from Willow Creek to Mogollon and ascended the eastern flank of Mogollon Peak to almost 9000 feet.
The type of Ashmunella mogoUoneiisis was collected on this occasion.
So far as we know no other mollusks had been taken in the region of the Gila headwaters prior to the collections here described.
A few mollusks collected between the San Pedro River and Clifton Arizona are included as they are geographically intermediate between the regions considered in articles IX and X.
Early in September 1913 Ferriss left Tucson with Frank Cole the guide of tourists and naturalists for Mt.
Thomas in southern Apache county 11496 feet above sea level.
Travehng by wagon brief stops were made in the Graham Mountains and upper end of the Peloncillo range.
At Clifton the wagon was stored saddle horses and pack mules secured and the trail followed to Metcalf.
From Clifton to the Double Circle ranch on Eagle Creek it is rough country mostly forested and with sufficient rock for snail cover but the snails do not like it.
The trail here ran northwesterly for about 35 miles then directly north 16 miles on Eagle Creek to the southern rim of the Blue Mountains.
Pupas and Vallonias were found at Honeymoon Ranger Station and Oreohelix a mile or two farther on fifty miles from Clifton.
The rim of the Blue has a wall of broken granite.
We found Ashmunella mogollonensis and a grayish form of Oreohelix cooperi the latter also in the quaking asp and corkark fir groves of the vicinity.
The route lay northwesterly again across the K. P. cienoAja down Corduroy and Fish Creeks and across Black River to Reservation Creek in Apache Co.
This high plateau has a continuous forest of the largest yellow pine blue spruce Douglas spruce thickets of quaking asp and alder.
Pupaj and Oreohelix were the principal snails.
Few were found on the domelike summit of Mt.
Thomas.
Along Black river Oreohelices from pale to nearly black from high to low were in every rock pile.
On the return trip the Raspberry trail from the rim of the Blue Mountain to Cosper's ranch on the Blue river was taken.
Down the Blue and San Francisco rivers Ashmunella Sonorellaand Oreohelix were found in the slides investigated but the journey was a hurried one.
This ground was thoroughly covered in the journey of 1914.
An account of the journey of 1913 may be found in Nautilus for January 1919.
On the expedition of 1914 Ferriss was accompanied by Mr. L. E. Daniels. Part of the route taken in 1913 was retraced  from Clifton Graham Co. Arizona up the San Francisco and Blue Rivers to Cosper's ranch a distance of about 50 miles.
From this point they continued up the Blue River northeast to its head and to Luna Socorro Co. New Mexico.
From Luna the party turned southeast across the San Francisco Mountains which lie south of Luna and by way of Alma to the Mogollon Mountains.
Some account of this trip was given in Nautilus XXVIII February 1915 pp.
109113.
The Ashmunellas collected were described and figured in Nautilus XXIX June July and August 1915 to which the reader is referred for these matters.
A map showing the collecting stations in the Mogollons may be found on page 331.
5 We have to iecord the death of Mr. Daniels October 23 1918.
He was a companion of both authors on collecting trips of some months' duration and it is a real sorrow that he will no longer share the labors of the trail or the cheer of the evening camp fire.
The San Francisco and the Blue rivers have been seriously torn up by floods in recent years but many of the snails remain.
Nearly all the farmers have been swept out.
Oreohelices Sonorella or Ashmunellas exist in every favorable situation from Clifton to Bob Cat on the interstate boundary except in a few short stretches of these rivers where the snails seem to have a dislike for the soil the chemistry of the rocks or something not traced.
This is about fifty miles in a straight line and thus very long miles.
Again on the Luna road to Alma in New JMexico Oreohelix was found on the crest of the San Francisco Mountains and the largest colony with many albinos came from the Rio Saliz a small stream draining the San Francisco Mountains eastward into the San Francisco River.
The MogoUons might be called a federation of sharp peaks.
It is not a high plateau like the White and Blue mountain region yet the forest conditions and tree associations are almost identical.
On the Bursam wagon road from Mogollon to Willow Creek ascending to 9000 feet and usually running along the north slope of the peaks the conditions for snails are ideal.
Ashmunella mogellonensis and Oreohelix cooperi were soon picked whenever logs or stones were turned in this for snail hunters twoday journey.
At two points Oreohelix barhata was found with the other two species.
Afterward when the canyons facing west and south were explored the smaller Ashmunellas were found in colonies with the three above mentioned.
Sonorellahas not yet been found in the Mogollon range.
In the extreme southern part of Arizona Chiricahua range the large toothless Ashmunellas are in colonies with the smaller toothed forms and Oreohelix barbata with them.
Also a Sonorellaand sometimes Holospira.
Three species of Sonorellahave been found in one slide but the general Arizona rule still remains one species of the genera of Hehces to a colony.
The banks of the canyons running west in the Mogollons were abrupt and the south bank furnished shade and cover.
In Big Dry Canyon running directly south the banks were so abrupt and close together that snails were living on' both sides of the stream and in the greatest abundance within our experience.
The wide differences in the Ashmunellas of the Mogollons and the presence of the Chiricahua Oreohelix barbata seem to indicate an alluring future for Mogollon conchology.
We believe that the deeper canyons penetrating farther into the large mountains had greater riches than Big Dry ldng in between them.
Here too in the canyon streams live the mountain trout friendly and well conditioned but they are not the cutthroat trout of the Colorado.
On the whole the Mogollons in scenery and camping delights are not far behind the White and Blue Mountain region of eastern Arizona.
Silver City is the nearest and most convenient railway station and moreover it lies in a region unexplored by the snail fraternity.
One more killing was made on the return to Clifton a colony of Sonorella at Steeple Rock Sept. 14.
Thus this event of 1914 had a continuous run of two months and seven days.
Aside from the minute Canadian Zone snails which have a wide distribution at high levels and the minutiae of the desert foothills such as ThysanopJiora hornii Succinea avara the small Zonitoides etc. there are several forms showing close affinity between the San FranciscoMogollon region and the Chiricahua Range.
The species Sonorellabinneyi Ashmunella chiricahuana and Orohelix barbata of the Chiricahuas are represented here by S. binneyi franciscana A. mogollonensis and 0. barbata.
The toothed Ashmunellas are of nearly related species and the same group of forms extends farther east in New Mexico to the Black Range.
None of the species mentioned are found in the northern or Dos Cabezas part of the Chiricahua range their habitats being from 80 to over 100 miles south of the regions now under consideration.
The intervening region is at the present time too dry for the existence of these snails.

Graham Mountain is composed of crumbling granite similar to that of Ninemile Water Hole in the Dos Cabezas range and is very dryon both north and south sides.
On top there is yellow pine and quaking asp forest.
Camp was made in Stockton Pass and a couple of hours' collecting done at Mud Spring on the summit.
Besides SonoreUa and Oreohelix Vitrina alashana was abundant and two young Vallonias were found.
The Pinaleno Range lies in line with the Chiricahua system though separated by a rather wide mesa in which the Southern Pacific R. R. runs from the northern end of the Dos Cabezas Mountains.
S. grahamensis is not closelj' related to any other species known to us.

By the sculpture of the embryonic shell as well as the general appearance this snail resembles Micrarionta hutsoni Clapp which is smaller more depressed with a larger umbihcus.
It is somewhat intermediate in form between hutsoni and indioensis.
If it reallj belongs to Micrarionta and there is no mistake about the locality it iswidely separated from its congeners.
The single specimen has been in the collection for many years.
It had been labelled H. strigosa Gld.

All of the other shells mentioned are such as live among rocks in arid foothills.
The speci99 men of Pupa hordacea seems to have been given to Mr. Binney the other species taken by Dr. Horn are in the collection of the Academy.
As Dr. Horn was also at Gila Bend Yuma and other places in western Arizona the possibility of an erroneous locality label for the specimen of M. praesidii is to be considered.
That specimen was not mentioned in Gabb's paper but he would doubtless have considered it a small H. strigosd.

Wooten who discovered this snail crossed the INIogollon Range from Willow to Silver Creeks along what is now called the Bursam road.
He also made an excursion from the West Fork of the Gila towards Mogollon Peak reaching a point about 1 miles due east of the Peak in the forks of Whitewater Creek at about 9000 ft.
It was probably here that he obtained the tj'pe of .1.

By the shells alone we would hardly separate this form from 0. cooperi apache yet the genitalia were found to be like 0. s. depressa.
The genitalia fig.
15 agree with those of 0. s. depressa and various allied forms except that the organs are longer in shells of similar diameter yet in Colorado depressa this is a rather variable character and it is somewhat affected by the conditions of preservation.
The penis is very long its internally costate portion hardly onethird of the entire length having about 4 principal ribs within the internall papillose portion flattened weakly ribbed within sometimes having a trilobed section distally.

The occurrence of this species in the Mogollons was a surprise as it was described from the Cave Creek region of the Chiricahuas far to the south.
It does not inhabit the dryer northern half of the Ghiricahua range and its distribution is therefore conspicuouslydiscontinuous.
It evidently changes much more slowly than the Ashmunellas though some little differentiation may be seen as noted below.
In Dry Creek it was taken in the slides with Ashmimella at Stations 62 64 68 70 72 75 77 78 and 79.
In most of these colonies it reaches large size even larger than in the Chiricahuas.
Two examples from Station 79 measure height 8 diam.
16 mm. and height 9 diam.
15.4 mm.
Usually there are several circular fringes on the last whorl above the periphery and more on the base than in Chiricahua examples.
In the latter fringes above are exceptional.
Counting that at the periphery there are usually 8 to 11 spiral wreaths in Dry Creek barbala 6 to 10 in Chiricahuan specimens.
In some lots the cuticular appendages are mostly or quite lost in the adult stage.
Some consist partly of smaller individuals and at Stations 64 and 75 all are small 1112 mm.

There is probably no direct relationship each being presumably a diminutive race of the normal larger forms of their respective ranges.
These small forms show decadence by the deep descent of the last whorl to the aperture.

The reception of the following papers was reported NOTE ON GISTEL'S GENERA OF FISHES.
BY DAVID STARR JORDAN.
In 1848 Johannes Gistel of Stuttgart published a peculiarly confused and crabbed volume called Naturgeschichfe des Thierreichs fi'ir hohere Schulen containing new generic names offered as substitutes for old ones and in every department of Zoology.
Most of the names he proposed to change were regarded by him often without reason as being preoccupied.
The book seems to have been overlooked by workers in systematic zoology and in every field.
In this paper I give the names of genera of fishes as offered by Gistel.
Nearly all of these occur in Gistel's introductory pages these having their pagination in Roman.
For a transcript of the names referring to fishes I am indebted to Mr. Barton A. Bean of the U. S. National Museum and to Mr. C. Davies Sherborn of the British Museum.
I have later received a copy of the book itself through the courtesy of Mr. E. P. Van Duzee of the California Academy of Sciences.
Of Gistel's new names the following seem to be valid  ABRON Gistel p. X replaces Platystoma Agassiz.
DAPALIS p. XI replaces Smerdis Ag.
fossil.
ENIXE p. IX replaces Drepane Cuvier and also the substitute name Harpochirus Cantor 1849.
HYPODYTES p. VIII intended to replace Apistus or Apistes Cuvier but its use by Quoy and Gaimard is especially mentioned and the language used highly elliptical Aspistes Quoy Astrol. Fisch.
would indicate that Apistus longispinis should be taken as type.
This species is type of Paracentropogon Bleeker which name Hypodytes should apparently replace.
NOTACMON p. IX replaces Eurynotus Ag.
fossil.
ODONUS p. XI is offered as a substitute for Xenodon Riippell 1835 preoccupied.
It is prior to Erythrodon Riippell and Pyrodon Kaup also offered as substitutes.
But Swainson in 1839 called the same genus Zenodon but whether offered by Swainson as a substitute or as a characteristic piece of carelessness is not made clear most Hkely the latter.
Fowler accepts Zenodon as a substitute for Xenodon instead of Erythrodon.
The question of Zenodon versus Odonus may be left for later decision.
PIRENE p. IX replaces Dasajllus Cuvier on account of the earlier .Zasc7ZMS.
But Dascyllus has been sometimes spelled Dascillus.
PERIURGUS p. X replaces Microps Ag.
fossil.
PROSCINETES p. X replaces Microdon Ag.
fossil this is prior to Polypsephis Hay 1899 also a substitute for Microdon.
SECUTOR p. IX replaces Devezimentum Fowler.
Secutor is apparently intended as a substitute for Equula but Gistel indicates as his type Equula insidiator.
He says Equula E. insidiator Fisch.
Secutor N. Centrogaster equula Gmelin is however the tautotype of Equula Cuv. which is a synonym of Leiognathus Lac.
Secutor Deveximentu7n is tangibly different from Leiognathus Scomber edentulus Bloch as a genus or subgenus.
STREPHON replaces Brontes C.  V. if distinct from Ares C.  V. STROTES replaces Platysomus Ag.
fossil.
In case names differing from older ones only in gender or some minor point in spelling are to be rejected as preoccupied the following additional names of Gistel would become tenable ANALITHIS p. X intended to replace Platyrhina M.  H. on account of the prior Platyrhinus.
This antedates Garman's substitute name of Discobatus.
ALAZON p. X intended to replace Poecilia on account of the earlier Pcecilus.
ENGLOTTOGASTER p. IX to replace Oreinus on account of Oreina.
But the genus Oreinus is of doubtful validity.
EURO p. IX to replace Eugnathus Ag. fossil on account of the prior Eugnatha.
MYRMILLO p. X to replace Mustelus Cuv.
on account of the prior Mustela L. It is equivalent to Pleuracromylon Gill.
PEDITES p. IX to replace Macropodus Lac an illformed name on account of the prior Macropus.
This may perhaps be allowed.
PRENES to replace Scatophagus Cuv. on account of Scatophaga.
This is prior to Cantor's substitute name of Cacodoxus 1849.
RHADAMISTA p. VIII is offered instead of Ctenodus fossil on account of the prior Ctenodon.
AGOREION p. X presumable type Acanthoderma spinosum Agassiz fossil.
This is offered as a substitute for Scleroderma Agassiz used in Fungi and in the form of Sclerodermus for a genus of bees.
But I find no genus Scleroderma' in Agassiz's works.
The name is probably a slip of memory for Acanthoderma Agassiz 1848 which is really preoccupied Acanthoderma Cantraine 1835 on this supposition Agoreion may be provisionally accepted in place of Acanthoderma.
SCROPHA p. VIII is offered in place of Ceratodus fossil on account of Ceratodon.
Other names suggested as substitutes are plainly inadmissible.
These among fishes are the following arranged in the order given by Gistel the alphabetical order of the names to be displaced CARCHARIAS p. VIII for Acanthias Risso on account of the prior Acanthia.
But Acanthias is a synonym of Squalus L. as properly restricted and Carcharias is twice preoccupied.
PELONECTES p. VIII for Acanthodes kg. said to be preoccupied which it is not but is replaceable by the original form Acanthoessus Ag.
GREMILLA p. VIII for Acerina Cuvier but Acerina Giildenstadt Cernua Schafer and Gymnocephahis Bl.
 Schn.
are older.
ADIAPNEUSTES p. VIII substitute for Acrodus Ag.
1838 WTongly regarded as preoccupied by Acrodon Zimm.
1840.
HISTIODROMUS p. VIII for Anastomus Gronow 1763 revived by Scopoli 1777 therefore not preoccupied by Anastomus Illiger 1835.
NOMALUS p. VIII for Ancylodon preoccupied by another substitute name Macrodon Schinz 1822.
CERDO p. VIII as substitute for Aselhis Klein.
Klein mentions Asellus only in a footnote under Callarias Gadus.
The name Cerdones appears in connection with the codfish and Cerdo may be regarded as a synonym of Gadus L. SCROFARIA p. VIII a needless substitute for Ausonia Risso itself a synonym of Luvarus Raf.
GLISCUS p. VIII substitute for Blochius Volta fossil for no reason save Gistel's objection to personal names in his scheme allowable only among plants and the very lowest animals.
THALASSOKLEPHTES p. VIII a substitute for Caninoa Narclo because it is improper to compare a prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte prince of Canino to a shark 1st denn der Prinz von Canino mit einen Hayen vergleichlichf CAPELLARIA p. VIII for Chironedes Cuvier preoccupied but already replaced by Aitennarius Cuv.
CiESO p. VIII a substitute for Chrysophrys Rtippell that is for Chrysophrys her da Rlipp.
 a synonym of Sparus.
ECHEMYTHES p. VIII an unexplained substitute for Chrysotosus Lac itself a synonym of Lampris.
RONCHIFEX p. VIII a substitute for Cossyphus Cuv. preoccupied but Bodianus Bloch and Harpe Lac are still older names for the same genus.
PODAGER p. IX a substitute for Gerres Cuvier on account of Gerris an older name of a genus of insects.
Podager is preoccupied in birds and thus cannot replace Gerres.
We must use Catochcenum Cantor 1849 if Gerres is discarded but Gerres and Gerris are words from different roots.
SYNERGUS p. IX a substitute for Megalurus Ag.
fossil preoccupied in mammals.
But Synergus is also preoccupied Hartig 1840 a genus of bees.
I have therefore proposed the new name Urocles Jordan as a substitute for both Megalurus and Synergus the type being Megalurus lepidotus Ag.
ELLOPS p. IX a substitute for Helops a genus of sturgeons U.o being the original Greek form.
APECHES p. IX a substitute for Johnius Bloch a personal name.
NEANIS p. IX a substitute for Julis Cuvier regarded as preoccupied by Julus L. But the two words are of different origin and meaning.
EXOLES p. IX a substitute for Lamia Bon. itself a synonym of Lacuna Cuvier.
APEPTON p. IX a substitute for Gouania Nardo a personal name.
ANEPISTOMON p. IX a substitute for the preoccupied name Leptorhynckus Smith itself a synonym of Ophisurus Lac as restricted.
SPANIUS p. IX a substitute for the preoccupied name Leptosoma Nardo which is itself probably a synonym of Monochirus Raf .
MAINA p. IX a substitute for Lethrinus Cuvier regarded as preoccupied by Lethrus Fabricius a genus of beetles.
MASSARIA p. IX a substitute for Liparis on the ground that the latter is used in botany.
ORODINUS p. IX a substitute for Lophotes Giorna 1803 for no reason.
PASCHALTESTES p. IX a substitute for Macquaria Cuv.
 Val. a personal name before it was applied to the river Maequarie.
ARNION p. X an unexplained substitute for Mugil L. PLECTROSTOMA p. X a substitute for Oxyrhi7ia Ag. preoccupied.
Both names are synonymous with Isur'us Raf.
EUPORISTA p. X a synonym for Plagusia Bon preoccupied.
Both names are synonymous with Symphurus Raf.
DEPORTATOR p. X a substitute for Plotosus Lac on account of the similarity of Plotosus to Plotus L. DEMIURGA p. X a substitute for Rhina Bonaparte a genus of rays on account of Rhina Oliver 1807 a genus of beetles.
But Rhina in this connection dates from Schneider 1801.
The name Rhina was also employed by various writers in place of Squatina its first binomial use in this connection dating from 1810 although occurring in polynomial reprints from Klein at earlier periods.
If Rhina is used for Squatina the name Demiurga should replace Rhamphohatis Gill 1861 itself also a substitute for Rhina Schneider.
CREOTROCTES p. X a substitute for Pelamys C.  V. 1831 subsequent to Palamita Bonaparte 1832 also a substitute for the same preoccupied name itself a synonym of Sarda Cuvier 1829.
If Sarda Plumier 1802   Ocyurus Gill is accepted Palamita would hold.
DENIUS p. X a substitute for Sargus Cuvier preoccupied both are synonyms of Diplodus Raf.
BORBORODES p. X a substitute for Scymnus Cuvier preoccupied in beetles.
But the substitute name of Scymnorhinus Bonaparte 1846 has priority.
PEROPTERA p. XI a substitute for Perioptera Gistel but I find neither name elsewhere.
ORTHOCOLUS p. XI a substitute for Thymallus Cuv. regarded as preoccupied by Thymalus Latreille 1803 a genus of beetles.
But the rootwords of the two names are different and as a substitute for Thymallus Choregon Minding 1832 is prior to Orthocolus.
TROMPE p. XI 109 an unexplained substitute for Toxotes Cuvier 1817 perhaps on account of the later Toxotus 1821.
APHOBUS p. XI a substitute for Trachidermus Heckel preoccupied as Trachyderma.
But Centridermichthys Richardson 1844 for the same group has priority over Aphobus.
CHiETICHTHYS p. XI a substitute ior Trichodon Cuvier regarded as preoccupied by Trichoda and Trichodes but the rootmeaning of Trichodon is different.
LITHULCUS p. XI a substitute for Trichopodus Trichopus Lac.
1802 p. 125 because used in botany.
But the same genus had been already called Osphromenus by the same author p. 116.
ENDYNAMA p. XIII 108 a substitute for Chrysophrys Cuvier itself a synonym of Spams L. as restricted.
EUPNCEA p. 105 type Plagusia lactea Bon. a synonym of Sy7nphurus Raf.
ATTILUS p. 109 a needless synonym of Umhrina Cuvier der Schattenfisch.
MELANTHA p. 109 a needless synonym of Corvina Cuvier die Seekrdhe.
NEW GENERA OF FISHES.
BY DAVID STARR JORDAN.
In the preparation of a catalogue of the generic names which have been apphed to fishes the writer has noted a number of vaHd genera and subgenera which have either received no name or are recorded under a name ah'eady preoccupied.
Some of these form the subject of the present paper.
AORIA Jordan.
Type Bagrus lamarrii Cuv.
 Val.
A substitute for Macrones Dumeril preoccupied by Macrones Newman 1841 a genus of Coleoptera.
AZURELLA Jordan.
Type Pomacentrus bairdi Gill Microspathodon bairdi Jordan.
This genus resembles Microspathodon Giinther with which it agrees in the peculiar dentition uniserial movable teeth and in general structure differing in having the vertical fins not elevated and the caudal simply limate.
The nostril in Azurella bairdi is much larger than in Microspathodon dorsalis which species we infer is congeneric with M. chrysurus Cuv.
 Val.
 the littleknown type of the genus.
The genus Stegastes Jenyns S. iinbricatus 1842 is probably identical with Microspathodon Giinther 1862 and of earlier date.
This matter demands further investigation.
COTYLICHTHYS Jordan.
Type C otylis fimbriata MxiWev Tvoche.
The genus Cotylis as first indicated by Miiller Wiegmann's Archiv. 1843 p. 297 contains but a single species Cotylis nudus M. .
T.  Lepadogaster nudus Bl.
 Schn.
 Gobiesox gyrinus Jordan  Evermann 1896 not Cyclotperus nudus L. a species as yet unrecognized.
Cotylii M.  T. nudus  gyrinus is a synonym of Gobiesox Lacepede fimbriata therefore requires a new name as above.
EPERLANIO Jordan.
Type Osmerus albatrossis Jordan and Gilbert the 'Tvadiak Smelt.
This genus or subgenus differs from Osmerus in the very long anal fin of twenty ra3s.
The teeth are much weaker than in Osmerus though stronger than in Spirinchus the scales smaller the gillrakers longer and the lower jaw heavier.
Eperlanus is an old name of the European smelt Osmerus eperlanus L. It has been already used as a synonym of Osmerus.
Eperlanio is an unused variant.
ERYTHROCLES Jordan.
Type Erythrichthys schlegeli Bleeker the name a substitute for Erythrichthys Temminck  Schlegel preoccupied by Erythrichthys Bonaparte Saggio 1831 based on Salmo erythrinus L. and therefore a synonym of Erythrinus Gronow Scopoli.
Erythrocles is one of several very closely related genera Emmelichthys Richardson Boxaodon Guichenot Inermia Poey Dipterygonotus Bleeker and Plagiogeneion Forbes but it seems to be distinct from all of these whatever their relation to one another.
EXTRARIUS Jordan.
Type Hyhopsis tetranemus Gilbert.
This genus is distinguished by the presence on each side of two maxillary barbels as in the oldworld genus Barhus.
In other regards it agrees with Macrhybopsis Cockerell Gobio gelidus Girard.
No other known species of American minnow or chub has more than two barbels.
IRILLION Jordan.
Type Coregonus oregonius Jordan and Snyder.
This genus differs from the other offshoots of Coregonus in the long sharp nose firm jaws and in the very large adipose fin.
It frequents mountain streams and is as gamy as a trout.
The name is from the merry wild Irillion rejoicing from fields of snow of Dunsany's dream world.
NAUTOPffiDIUM Jordan.
Type  Porichthys plectrodon Jordan  Gilbert  Batrachus porosissimus Cuv.
 Val.
This genus is closely allied to Porichthys Girard notaius differing mainly in the palatine dentition.
There are but four or five teeth on each palatine one or two of them developed as a strong canine.
In Porichthys there are many small palatine teeth none of them caninelike.
The name Nautopcedium 'aooTzacdur sailorboy refers to the buttonlike luminous spots which have suggested the vernacular name of Midshipman.
OSHIMIA Jordan.
Type Micracanthus marchei Sauvage.
Name a substitute for Micracanthus Sauvage 1878 preoccupied by Microcanthus Swainson 1839 a misprint or misspelling of the same word.
This name is given in honor of Mr. Masamitsu Oshima scientific expert of Formosa and author of an admirable memoir now in press on the river fishes of Formosa.
RHEOCLES Jordan  Hubbs.
Type Eleotris sikorce Sauvage.
This genus belongs to the Atherinidce as Dr. Boulenger has suggested.
It is characterized by its robust form and its few gillrakers about 10 which as figured by Sauvage Poissons de Madagascar are notably short and thick.
SYLETOR Jordan.
Type Pisoodonophis cruentifer Goode  Bean.
This eel one of the few which burrows into the flesh of fishes is clearly not a Pisoodonophis.
Its peculiar and savage physiognomy due to the constriction of its neck and the snakelike form of the head with the powerful muscular enlargements of the cheeks distinguish it adequately from the other Ophichthoid eels with blunt teeth TuXijTcop a spoiler.
UNAGIUS Jordan.
Type Cryptophthahnus rohustus Fra.nz 1910.
The name Cryptophthalmus is preoccupied in Crustacea Rafinesque 1812 and in moUusks Ehrenberg 1831.
Unagius may be substituted for it.
Unagi is the Japanese word for eel.
UROCLES Jordan.
Type Megalurus lepidotus Ag.
fossil.
This name is offered as a substitute for Megalurus Agassiz 1833 preoccupied in birds Horsfield 1820 and for Synergus Gistel 1848 preoccupied in Hymenoptera both these having the same type.
VERATER Jordan.
Type Oligopus ater Risso  Pteridium atrum FiUppi  Verany.
Substitute for Pteridium F.  V. preoccupied by Pteridium Scopoli 1777 which is a substitute for Pteraclis Gronow 1763 and 1772 the use in 1772 unquestionably binomial.
PNICTES Jordan.
Type Achiropsis asphyxiatus Jordan  Goss.
This species of sole described from Goyaz Brazil differs from Achiropsis Steindachner and from all other soles in the complete obliteration of the gill opening of the right or eyed side.
ERREX Jordan.
Type Glyptocephalus zachirus Lockington.
This species the Rex Sole of the San Francisco fishermen an excellent foodfish.
differs from Glyptocephalus Gottsche and from all other flounders in the very long and falcate pectoral fin of the right side this fin being longer than the head.
AINIA Jordan.
Type Callopterus agassizi Thiolliere fossil.
A substitute name for Callopterus Thiolliere 1858 preoccupied as Callopterus Chaud. 1838 a beetle.
The name is from the department of Ain in France where the fossil in question was found.
RAIAMAS Jordan.
Type Cyprinus bola Hamilton.
A substitute name for Bola Giinther 1868 preoccupied by Hamilton.
The species Raiamas bola is well knovn to anglers in India as ''Rajah mas.
TARSISTES Jordan.
Type Rhynchohatis Philippi 1858.
A substitute for the latter name preoccupied as Rhynchohatus.
The genus is founded on a large ray with a linear flat paddlelike snout rounded at tip somewhat as in Polyodon and MitsukurinaPhilippi gave to this animal no specific name.
It may be called Tarsistes philippii rdfmoq an oarblade .
The type is from the island of Juan Fernandez off the coast of Chili.
VIGIL Jordan.
Type Pleurolepis pellucidus Agassiz.
A substitute for Pleurolepis Agassiz preoccupied in fossil fishes.
The type species is placed by Jordan and Evermann in Ammocrypta but Vigil pellucidus differs from Ammocrypta beani in having the sides of the head scaly the sides of body largely scaled and the mouth much smaller.
The name Vigil on the watch alludes to the habit of lying motionless buried in the sand only the alert eyes being visible.
ORQUETA Jordan.
Type Micropteryx polycentrus Kner.
Replaces Micropus Kner S. B. Akad.
Wiss.
Wein 1868 p. 28 that name being four times preoccupied Orqueta differs from Chloroscombrus Girard in the very much larger number of dorsal spines.
The name Orqueta is a Spanish vernacular for Chloroscombrus orqueta Jordan and Gilbert on the west coast of Mexico.
The following annual reports were ordered to be printed REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY.
While the Recording Secretary has been able personally to discharge the duties of his office during the year he is indebted to the Assistant Librarian William J.
Fox for indispensable cooperation for which grateful acknowledgment is due.
As was the case last year the statistics of administration have been prepared by Mr. Fox.
Dr. J. Percy Moore and Dr. Philip P. Calvert have placed the Secretary under obligation by acting as Recording Secretary during the earlier meetings of the Academy and the Council for which sincere thanks are given.
The ByLaws provide for the closing of the academic year with the last of November.
Since that period last year meetings have been held on December 18 1917 January 15th February 19th March 19th.
April 9th April 16th and November 16th of the current year.
The meeting of April 9th was held in commemoration of the President Samuel Gibson DLxon M.D. LL.D. Sc.D. who died February 2d.
Dr. Dixon had been elected a member of the Academy February 25 1890.
He had served as President since 1896.
The progress of the society during the twentytwo years which have since elapsed is Dr. Dixon's best memorial.
Details of his services to science will be found in the proceedings of the memorial meeting held in April.
As a mark of respect to the memory of Dr. Dixon the election of his successor in the presidency was by resolution postponed until the annual meeting.
Communications were made at the meetings during the year by Messrs. Harley Stamp Philip P. Calvert James A. G. Rehn Witmer Stone Edwin G. Conklin John Cadwalader Benjamin F. Royer and Henry Skinner.
In addition to the Proceedings of the Dixon Memorial Meeting papers were presented for publication by Henry A. Pilsbry F. J. Keeley Henry W. Fowler Anna M. Cullen Janet P. Jameson Mitchell Carroll Joseph Hall Bodine Bruce Wade James A. G. Rehn and E. G. Vanatta.
The sixteenth volume of the Journal was completed by the publication of a beautifully illustrated paper by Clarence B. Moore on the aboriginal antiquities of Florida.
24 Three hundred and thirtyseven pages of the Proceedings were issued with five plates.
The Entomological Section the American Entomological Society has published four hundred and thirtyseven pages of the Transactions illustrated by twentynine plates.
Four hundred pages of the Entomological News illustrated by twenty plates have been issued.
Parts ninetysix and ninetyseven of the Manual of ConcholOGY comprising one hundred and eightyeight pages have been completed by Dr. Pilsbry and distributed.
Four members and seven correspondents have been elected.
Their names are recorded in the Proceedings as issued.
The deaths of nine members were announced.
Resignation of membership by G. B. Heckel was accepted.
The death of Joseph Willcox October 1st deprived the Academy of the services of one who had been interested in the mineralogical work of the society since his election to membership in December 1867.
He had served for years as Custodian of the Isaac Lea collections a position which he held at the time of his death.
The Ludwick Institute Free Lecture Courses were delivered at the Academy on Mondays Thursdays and Fridajs January 7th to April 26th by Witmer Stone B. Franklin Royer James A. G. Rehn Spencer Trotter Henry A. Pilsbry J. Percy Moore and J. Fletcher Street.
It was necessary early in the year conforming to government regulations to change the lectures scheduled for Monday evenings to Thursday evenings.
To economize fuel it was also necessary to give a portion of the course in the more easily heated library hall.
Ten of the lectures were on the natural history of Philadelphia and vicinity especially adapted to schoolchildren.
The latter were by Messrs. Stone Moore Street Pilsbry and Rehn.
Meetings of the Pennsylvania Audubon Society the Babies' Welfare Association and the Philadelphia Pediatric Society were held in the Lecture Hall.
Edward J. Nolan Recording Secretary.
REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY.
The following scientific men all Americans were elected correspondents John Henry Comstock Herbert Spencer Jennings Frank Rattray Lillie Alfred Goldsborough Mayor John Campbell Merriam George Howard Parker and Charles Richard Van Hise.
During the course of the year President Charles R. Van Hise and Prof. Samuel W. Williston died.
It is probable that the interruption of correspondence with European countries prevented the verification of the reported deaths of others.
Foreign correspondence which has been steadily decreasing during the progress of the war fell this year to its lowest ebb.
Invitations were received to participate in the celebration of the semicentennial of the founding of the Kansas Academy of Science and of the twohundredandfiftieth anniversary of the University of Lund.
Prof. Samuel W. Williston was appointed a delegate to the former and a letter of congratulation sent to the latter.
From the Academie des Sciences BellesLettres et Artes de Rouen was received a copy of a resolution passed at a fete held at the Academy on July Fourth expressing admiration for the course material and moral taken by the United States and its President in defense of the Liberty Law Justice and Civilization of the World.
A letter of similar import was received from Emile Riviree a correspondent of the Academy.
Inquiries for information were answered as usual.

REPORT OF THE CURATORS.
The past year on account of unprecedented conditions incident to the war has not been one in which any important work outside the usual routine of the museum has been possible.
Fuel restrictions have prevented the heating of the public halls and during certain days necessitated the closing of the workrooms.
One of our janitors left our employ early in the year and in order to meet additional expenses elsewhere we have managed to avoid the necessity of filling this position.
The absence of several volunteer workers during most of the year and of Mr. Rehn for several weeks all on work connected with the war has hindered the progress of research work to some extent while the serious illness of Dr. Skinner has kept him from his office for over two months.
Notwithstanding these hindrances however the Curators feel that they may congratulate themselves upon having been able to maintain the usual Museum activities without any detriment to the collections or their arrangement during these trying times.
Early in the summer a competent steam engineer was engaged to examine the entire heating plant and to draw up plans for remedying serious defects in the present system as well as for the installation of new boilers.
We were fortunate enough to secure two Spencer boilers which have been placed in the engine house and have already proved very satisfactory although some of the repiping is still unfinished.
The expense of these important improvements is covered by an appropriation made at the last session of the State Legislature and referred to in our last report.
The falling of certain sections of plaster ceiling has necessitated the removal of all the ceiling covering in the mineralogical hall with the intention of substituting a sheet metal ceiling at the earliest opportunity.
Additional exhibits have been added to the collection of native trees to the local collection of birds and nests presented by the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club to the Clarence B. Moore collection of Indian antiquities and to the William S. Vaux collection of minerals.
Numerous classes of schoolchildren have visited the Museum during the year and various duplicate specimens especially sets of labelled minerals have been presented to schools in Philadelphia and vicinity.
During the year Dr. Skinner made some important entomological collections in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
Dr. Stone spent several weeks in making an exhaustive collection of the flora of southern Cape May County N. J. and some local field work was carried on by other members of the Museum staff.
Mr. Clarence B Moore has also continued his explorations of the Indian mounds of the Southern States and presented the Academy with valuable material.
Details of work in the several departments follow.
Mammals.
A number of valuable specimens received from the Zoological Society of Philadelphia have been prepared as skins or skeletons while a large number of skeletons and skulls previously prepared in the rough have been macerated numbered and placed in the study series.
This work was carried on by the taxidermist Mr. David McCadden.
Besides entering accessions the entire register of the Rhoads collection numbering 4390 entries has been copied into the regular mammal catalogue.
Specimens have been loaned during the year to Dr. J.
A. Allen and Mr. A. H. Howell.
Birds.
A number of accessions to the local collection have been placed on exhibition and much of the collection rearranged and relabelled.
The services of Miss Ruth Faries were secured during nine months of the year and much needed clerical work was accomplished.
Several temporary catalogues were copied into the regular Academy register including that of the Hoopes collection making a total of some 14000 entries.
In addition new labels were prepared for all the skins of the lower famihes of Passeres in the study collection as well as of the Tanagridae and most of the Fringillidse.
The eggs in the Pennock collection and many of those in the Drown collection were placed in glasscovered boxes and catalogued while many unmounted specimens of birds were converted into skin specimens.
Dr. Stone although mainly occupied with the executive duties of the Museum revised several of the families in the study collection and prepared a report on the Jewel collection of Panama birds which has been published in the Proceedings.
The most notable accessions received during the year were the Mrs. W. A. Drown collection of bird eggs and mounted birds and a collection of Colombian birds obtained by purchase.
Dr. H. C. Oberholser Mr. W. E. C. Todd Mr. Edwin Ashby and Mr F. H. Kennard have made use of the collections while specimens have been loaned to Mr. Todd Mr. C. B. Cory and Dr. C. W. Richmond.
Reptiles and Fishes.
Mr. Henry W. Fowler who has had charge of the fishes as well as of the reptiles reports that 1783 fishes have been received during the year which have all been catalogued and labelled.
He has also critically identified some 400 species of fishes.
These comprised specimens in the Academy collection from Brazil Panama the West Indies and Australia as well as our entire series of African fishes and a collection from Samoa loaned by Capt.
C. F. Silvester from which the Academy will receive duplicates.
Two papers were published in the Proceedings on Philippine fishes and on a collection received from Paraguay.
Progress was made on the critical study of the series of flying fishes halfbeaks and green gars.
General care of the collections both of fishes and reptiles has occupied considerable time necessitating the rebottling and cleansing of many specimens.
Mr. Fowler did some field work in Perry County Pa. and Cape May Co. N. J.
Specimens of reptiles were loaned during the year to the American Museum of Natural History.
Mr. Alex.
Ruthven Dr. Thomas Barbour Mr. F. N. Blanchard and Mr. Alvin Seal spent some days in studying material at the Academy.
MOLLUSKS.
Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry curator of Mollusca reports that accessions to the conchological department have been received from sixtyseven persons and institutions.
Among them may be mentioned a series of Congo mollusks from the American Museum of Natural History including paratypes of many new species and a considerable number of Hawaiian mollusks received from the Bishop Museum and from Prof. W. A. Bryan.
Mr. J. H. Ferriss shared his Arizona collections of 1917 and 1918 with the Academy and Prof. Junius Henderson has presented series of his Idaho and Colorado collections.
The revision of the Academjcollection of Pupillidse has been continued in connection with the publication of a second volume on this group in the Manual of Conchology.
In collaboration with Mr. Ferriss a report on the mollusks of the Santa Catahna mountains and the MogoUon mountains Arizona has been prepared for publication.
Mr. E. G. Vanatta has continued the arrangement of the exhibition series of shells and Miss Caroline Ziegler has made good progress in cataloguing the specimens.
Considerable time has been given to the determination of material for correspondents.
Mr. J.
A. Ferriss W. H. Clapp and Edwin Ashby have spent some time in studying in the department during the year and specimens were loaned to Mr. E. P. Chase Dr. Paul Bartsch and Mr. J.
B. Henderson.
Mr. R. T. Jackson also borrowed some fossil mollusca.
Insects.
The department of Entomology has had the usual care and attention given to it by those in charge.
Dr. Henry Skinner and Mr. E. T. Cresson Jr. have looked after all the orders except the Orthoptera which have had the attention of Mr. J.
A. G. Rehn.
The accessions for the year amount to 2953 specimens most of which have been incorporated in the collection.
A number of families have been rearranged the Scarabsediae Rhipiphoridse Stylopidse Cleridse Malachidse Meloidae and Buprestidse in the Coleoptera the Scathophagidse Sepsidse and Ephydridse in the Diptera and the large series of exotic Noctuidse among the Lepidoptera.
Some valuable material in the last order collected by Dr. Skinner in the White Mountains of New Hampshire was incorporated in the collection.
In the order Hemiptera the family Cicadidse has been rearranged in accordance with identifications made by Mr. Wm.
T. Davis and in the Hymenoptera the H. L. Viereck types of Andrena have been placed in the type series.
In the Orthoptera besides the mounting and rearrangement of material studies have been made of an extensive series of Brazilian material and three papers prepared and published upon it.
A study has also been made of our African material as well as of several African collections loaned for identification of which the Academy will receive a series of duplicates.
A paper was also published in the Proceedings on the North American Eumastseinse while correspondence by Mr. Rehn has resulted in the receipt of valuable material in return for determination.
Several visiting entomologists especiallly Dr. E. C. Van Dyke have made use of the collections and material has been loaned to J. R. Malloch J. S. Hine and R. W. Dawson.
Plants.
Mr. Stewardson Brown who has had charge of the herbarium reports that during the year the herbarium of the late Charles S. Williamson presented by his sister Miss Mary Williamson has been distributed throughout the herbarium so that the specimens are now readily accessible with the other material.
The J. J. Carter herbarium the gift of Mr. H. S. Gatchell has been in a great part mounted ready for stamping and distribution.
Numerous other collections received from various sources have been mounted by Miss Ada Allen who has been continued as an aid in this work.
The local collection has received considerable attention from Mr. S. S. Van Pelt who has mounted many specimens that have been received.
Mr. Bayard Long has also given the collection considerable critical study.
Minerals and Rocks.
The Curators are indebted to Mr. F. J. Keelej' Curator of the William S. Vaux collection and to Mr. Samuel G. Gordon a student on the Jessup I'und for the care of this department.
Mr. Gordon has labelled and catalogued a number of accessions to the Wm.
S. Vaux and the general collections and prepared a check list of the entire series.
The William S. Vaux collection now numbers about 9000 specimens nearly half of which are on exhibition the Academy general series 10500 specimens of which about 1000 are exhibited and the Adam Seybert collection which is kept separate 1825 specimens while there are 80 falls of meteorites represented.
The duplicate specimens not on exhibition are arranged systematically in storage cases immediately below the exhibition series so that they may be consulted with the greatest ease.
Mr. Gordon has overhauled a large number of mineral and rock specimens received at various times and cleaned and labelled such as are of value.
The rock series now in the Academy's possession including the first and second Pennsylvania Geological Survey collections amounts to about 19000 specimens.
The most important accession during the year was the Mrs. W. A. Drown collection presented by Miss Emily Drown comprising some 6000 specimens.
It was especially notable for the large number of species represented a number of which were new to our collection.
Archeology.
Miss H. N. Wardle has overhauled several thousand specimens mostly belonging to the Haldemann collection which were stored in the basement and has cleansed and identified them entering some 2000 in the catalogue.
Little new material was obtained during the year.
Mr. Clarence B. Moore's expedition during the spring of 1918 explored territory along the Apalachacola River the Flint River to Bainbridge Ga. and the Florida coast from St. Andrew's Bay to Crystal River.
The result demonstrated how thorough had been his earlier exploration of the same region as little new material was obtained.
Pottery and artifacts regarded as duplicates were presented by Mr. Moore to the Museum of the American Indian Heye Foundation.
Owing to necessary repairs to his boat Mr. Moore was compelled to abandon his usual autumn expedition.
Throughout the year the undersigned Curators have been without the advice and counsel of their associate Maj. Henry Tucker who since the entry of America into the war has been in the service of his country in the medical corps of the Army.

356 proceedings of the academy of dec Report of the Curator of the William S. Vaux Collections December 1 1918.
Efforts during the past jear in the direction of securing as many rare and unusual species as possible have resulted in the addition of no less than 127 species not hitherto represented in the William S. Vaux collection of which number 87 were purchased and 40 selected from the Drown collection.
This brings the total number of distinct species in the collection up to 804 not including meteorites hydrocarbons varieties or doubtful species.
Altogether the number of accessions during the year exceeded 800 of which 104 were purchased 700 derived from the Drown collection 3 presented by Mr Thomas Harvey and 3 presented by Mr. Samuel G. Gordon who has continued his valuable services in caring for the collection.
