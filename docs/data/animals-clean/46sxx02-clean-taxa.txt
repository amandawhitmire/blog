CRITICAL LIST OF MOLLUSKS COLLECTED IN THE POTOMAC VALLEY.
BY H. A. PILSBRY.
The mollusks enumerated in this paper were collected by Mr. .1.
E. Ives and the writer during the course of a pedestrian tour through parts of Pennsylvania Maryland and West Virginia in September 1892.
The route walked over was as follows From Gettysburg Pa. westward to the summit of South Mountain thence southwest to Maryland across the Cumberland Valley to Hagerstown Md.
From this point the Cumberland Pike State road was followed with occasional slight deviations westward to Cumberland Md.
.From Cumberland Mr. Ives proceeded to Luray Va. across the multitude ol ranges which traverse West Virginia.
The writer returning to Philadelphia stopping to collect at Cherry Run on the Potomac River in West Virginia.
On such a trip one is constantly tempted to stop by the wayside to examine or collect  and if he be possessed of that passion for collecting specimens which is the fatal birthiight of most naturalists these interruptions of the journey are likely to be many and long.
The eye soon learns to recognize good collectingground and the mere consideration that supper and a restingplace are miles farther on is lightly esteemed when the charms and hidden possibilities of a wooded ravine weight the balance.
The number of localities represented in this collection is therefore great as would be expected from the above considerations.
Probably almost all of the species of mollusks inhabiting Maryland from the South Mountain to Cumberland were found ly us and as the southern tier of counties in Pennsylvania is identical with laryland in geologic and topographic features the list practically tells what that portion of Pennsylvania contains of land and freshwater shells.
The list of a collection made by Mr. Witmer Stone at York Furnace York Co. Pa. has been kindly furnished by him and the species occurring there are noted hezein.
The general topography and geology of these portions of Pennsylvania and Maryland are well known.
South Mountain the Blue Ridge Martin's Mountain Sideling Mountain Town Ridge Wills Mountain and numerous smaller intermediate ridges cut this district into a series of wide and narrow valleys trending N. E. by S. W. each valley supplying a creek tributary to the Potomac.
The valleys are mostly eroded anticlines so that a great variety of strata are exposed  but sandy shales and shaly sandstones predominate.
The Potomac crosses this series of parallel ridges nearly at a right angle.
It is everywhere shallow and rapids are frequent.
At Cumberland it is dammed and all the water which is not used by the city waterworks feeds the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal which has its western terminus here.
Above the backwater from this dam it is a shallow rapid stream from forty to sixty feet wide with a rocky or in places gravelly bed  and the low banks are fringed with graceful maple willow and sycamore trees often festooned with grape vines and in places mingled with oak and locust.
The water here is of a dark sepia tint being stained by the spruce sawdust from sawmills upon its upper course and probably also by decaying laurel and bay leaves for the region above is densely wooded.
No mollusk life whatever could be found in this brown water but minnows and tadpoles were seen.
Below the dam at Cumberland the wide riverbed is dry except for occasional pools in which a few Planorbis blcarinatus and Amnicola limosa live.
Except in times of high water therefore the lower course of the river is an entirely distinct stream from this upper reach.
About ten miles below Cumberland the river has about the same volume as the stream above the influence of the Cumberland dam and the water is clear.
Wills Creek which flows through the city of Cumlierland is a swift stream with a rocky bed.
The water is of crystal transparence but no snails except Planorbis bicarinalHs were found in it.
Evitt's Creek which drains the valley next eastward contains Ancidosa in abundance.
Family SELENITID.
This family differs from Zonituhr n having the teeth of the radula all aculeate and in lacking pedal grooves above the footedges.
Genus Selenites Fischer.
Selenites concavus Say.
Cumberland Allegheny County Md. 64679.
Morgan County W. Va. opposite Hancock 64678.
It has been taken by Mr. W. Stone at York Furnace York County Pa. and by Mr. C. W. Johnson in Fulton County Pa.
It occurs over nearly the whole of eastern North America.
Family ZONITIDJE.
A complete rearrangement of the American genera of this family is necessary and although a local fauual list may be considered hardly the place for radical changes in nomenclature still it may be preferable to the perpetuation of an untenable system.
The species which were formerly referred to the genus Zonites will now be distributed into several genera distinguished by important structural peculiarities.
The genus Zonites of Montfort has no representative in America being confined to the circumMediterranean and adjacent faunas.
In this genus the shell is large solid opaque and discoidal and is always strongly carinated at least when young.
The jaw has a strong median projection the genitalia lack all accessory organs being of the haplogonous type.
The synonymy of the genus is as follows 1810.

Collected by Witmer Stone.
No specimens were found by us in Maryland.
The genital organs of this species and its allies seem to have been misinterpreted by writers on United States forms who have mistaken the swollen base of the vas deferens for the penis and have considered the penis itself to be a dart sack or prostate gland of some sort.
In 0. fuliginosa the penis P. is a rather short stout sac with the retractor muscle .
p. insei'ted at its apex and attached distally to the floor of the lung.
Internally the distal half of the cavity of the penis is densely finely and rather sharply granulated the opening of the vas deferens is near the apex of the cavity and is not provided with a papilla.
The lower portion of the vas deferens v. d. is enormously swollen and for a short distance from its insertion it is firmly bound to the penis itself.
The vagina vag.
is curiously swollen near the base.
Thespermatheca sp.
is large subglobular and together with its rather long duct is bound firmly to the oviduct.
The albumen gland .

is uncommonly large.

This genus consists of small glassy zonitoid snails having no accessoiy organs developed upon the genital system differing in this respect from the Zonitoldes section of G tstrodonta.
The type of Vitrea is H. crydalllna Miiller of Europe.
There are a great many generic synonyms but part of the names quoted above are available for sectional divisions.
The American species must all be examined to ascertain whether or not they possess a dart sac as those having this structure must be removed to the genus Gastrodoiita.
I have not had time to examine the soft parts of any of them.

 Ventrideris Binney and Bland Laud and Freshwater Shells of N. A. I p. 292 proposed for H. jularis and H. snppressa Say.
The shell is provided with internal teeth or lamellae in the typical forms of this genus.
In another group consisting of G. ligera and its allies there are no teeth but a strong white callus upon the floor of the last whorl.
In the section Zonitoldes this callus is wanting and the whorls are rounded below.
The prominent feature of the genitalia is the presence of a dart sac containing a long curved calcareous dart situated upon the vagina and this is the most important generic character.
In PI.
I fig.
4 is shown the dart of G. llgem magnified twelve diameters.
There are strong reasons for believing that the presence of a dart the coronal glands being correlated with it is a very old character in Zoiitide and that it was present in the nndifterentiated stock from wliich nearly all the existing genera have diverged. '
It this be true then Vltrea Omphalina etc. must be regarded as secondarily haplogonous having lost the dart apparatus which was present in their ancestors.

It is common around Philadelphia where typical tridentata also occurs.
This form is distinguished from typical tridentata by the lower position of the upier liptooth the latter part of the parietal lamella being directed toward this tooth or to a point above it whilst in the type the lipteeth are more separated and the latter portion of the parietal lamella is directed toward a point on the peristome between them.
The variety is more coarsely striated also.

At both of these localities it is found living with typical P. tridentata.
In its typical development this vainety is a compact shell of a reddishbrown color varying to white in some localities the spire is lowconvex composed of six closely coiled whorls the last being notably deflexed in front and strongly constricted behind the lip.
The aperture is strongly dished or basinshaped the outer lip bears a broad tongueshaped inflected tooth situated at the position of the periphery of the shell.
The middle of the basal lip bears a small stpiarish tubercle which is often laterally compressed.
The parietal wall hears an elevated oblique blade which is typically almost straight and never much curved.

No shells exhibiting the characters of fraud ale ntn have been found in the cisAlleghenian region of eastern Pennsylvania or New Jersey so far as I can judge by the collections of Philadelphia couchologists which cover a great many localities and a long series of years.
This region is inhabited by typical tridentnta its variety jaxtidens and by the if.
introferens of Bland and authors generally.
P. fallax Say.
Gettysburg Pa. 64722.
The variations of the tridentata group of Tilodopis are an extremely intricate study and strange as it may seem the names hitherto attached to some of the forms require revision.
Helix fallax was described by Say from the vicinity of Philadelphia but the form heretofore so called is not found near Philadelphia nor has it been within the present century if ever.
The Triodopses found in this vicinity are 1 P. trideidafa Say typical 2 P. tridoitafi jiixtldens  and 3 P. introferens Bland.
These three forms are represented in the collection of the Academy byspeciraens collected many years ago as well as by others taken during the past year and no other forms or species have to my knowledge leen found anywhere near Philadelphia.
The conclusion that one of these three is the faUax of Say is therefore an extremely probable one.
Upon turning to Say's original deseriition fjourn.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci. V p. 119 we find that it aplies exactly to the shell known as Helix vtfroferens Bid.
Say mentions the parietal tooth curving downwards so as to nearly reach the termination of the labrum and says  This resembles the trideiitdt I nob. but the upper tooth of the labrum is much inflected the spire is more elevated and the size is less considerable. '
' He gives the diameter as  ninetwentieths of an inch which is exactly the size of the Philadelphia  introferetts.
It should le added that Say's types of frideidiiti and fdla.c are no longer in existence.
In view of the facts of the case it seems to me necessary to use Say's mime falIk.v for the species hitherto called liitroferens the latter becoming a synonym.
The prominent features of this shell besides its elevated spire and and inflected upper tooth are the angular curvature of the parietal tooth and the continuation inward of the basal tooth and the callus around the 'profound sinus between the two lipteeth.

Family PLEUROCERIDE.
Genus ANCULOSA Say.
A. carinata Brug.
This species is the characteristic mollusk of perennial streams in the Chesapeake Bay riversystem.
It has been found only in waters of this drainage being unknown in the adjacent Delaware system on the northeast in the Ohio system on the west and in streams emptying into the Atlantic to the south of Chesapeake Bay.
Aiiculosa being essentially a tiansAlleghenian genus we may with considerable confidence surmise that the ancestors of A. carinata were introduced into the head waters of the Potomac from some creek of the Ohio system and from this colony spread throughout the Chesapeake drainage.
The fact that it inhabits the James River and other Virginian streams which are now isolated from the Potomac and Susquehanna by a long stretch of salt water indicates that since the introduction of Ancidosa and the differention of the species carinata the Chesapeake region has been much more elevated than it is at present.
Ancalosa can endure neither salt nor slowflowing water and it must have spread to these various streams at a time when the united waters of the Susquehanna Potomac Rapahannock and James Rivers flowed in one mighty stream to the Atlantic.
It may be suggested that the distribution has lieen accomplished overland but tliis is highly improbable for if so why is the species so strictly limited to the Chesapeake system
Why has it not invaded the DelawareSchuylkill drainage which otters equally favorable stations and is separated by but a few miles from the eastern tributaries of the Susquehanna
We must conclude that Strepoinafldn' require as a rule actual water counnunieation for their spread from stream to stream.
The exceptions are probably rare and unimportant.
The presence of this species in the headwaters of the Roanoke River at the hamlet of Lafayette Montgomery Co. Va.  is readily accounted for by the close proximity of the creeks forming the head of the James and those flowing into the Roanoke.
Some time a 1894.
naturaIj sciences of Philadelphia.
27 rivulet inhabited by Anculosa was stolen from the James by the Koauoke drainage thus transferring the species. Goniobasis virgiiiica is ajparently a much older resident of the eastern couutry.
It ranges from the Connecticut River at Deep River Conn. to middle Virginia.
The genus Goniobasis is known to be a much more ancient group geologically.
The distribution of Aiiciilosa carinata is pretty thoroughly known by the localities given in Tryon's monograph and the specimens in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy and the U. S. National Museum.
 It extends northward to the headwaters of the Susquehanna in New York State.
Both of the collections named possess specimens said to be from regions outside of the Chesapeake drainage such as Ohio Lake Erie etc. audDeKay reports it from Lake Champlaiu but these localities are there is not much doubt false.
The older collectors were not so punctilious about correct habitats for their shells as we have now learned to be and in the absence of confirmation by later collections the evidence of these old labels must be held insufficient.
Lakes Champlain and Erie and the State of Ohio are now well known to many ardent and reliable students of conohology and such a conspicuous shell as A. carimda would not be overlooked by them.
The following localities are represented in the collections made by Mr. Ives and myself Susquehanna River York Co. 62820 collected by Witmer Stone.

Both smooth and striatetl specimens occur indiscriminately mingled as is the case elsewhere wherever I have collected this species.
Nearly all of the smooth examples are conspicuously twobanded as are many of the striated ones also.
This species is found throughout the larger streams of the Potomac drainage and north to New York and Connecticut but the soutliern limit of its range has not leen accurately determined.
