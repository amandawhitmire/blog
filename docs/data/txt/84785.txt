PROCEEDINGS 



OF THE 



ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES 



OF PHILADELPHIA. 



January llfh, 1848. 

 Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Dr. S. P. Hildreth, of Marietta, Ohio, dated 

 December 24th, 1847, relating to a peculiar variety of the Glow- 

 worm. 



A letter from Dr. Joel Y. Shelley, dated Hereford, Berks county, 

 Pennsylvania, in reference to some valuable fossil remains from that 

 vicinity, was read and referred to the G-eological and Mineralogical 

 Committee. 



A communication was read from the Secretary of the Geological 

 Society of London, dated Somerset House, 4th of November, 1847, 

 acknowledging the receipt of recent numbers of the Proceedings. 



Dr. Morton read a letter addressed to him by Dr. R. W. Gibbe?, 

 dated Columbia, S. C, December 25th, 1817, in relation to the Basil- 

 osaurus, and announcing a new fossil genus Saurocetus. 



A letter was read from Dr. William M. Carpenter, of New Orleans, 

 dated December 11th, 1847, enclosing a communication addressed to 

 the Academy, by Dr. E. Pilate, of Opelousas, S. C, dated October 29th, 

 1847, and proposing exchanges of books or objects of Natural History. 

 Referred to the Curators. 



Dr, Leidy remarked, that the existence of the eye in the perfect 

 condition of the Cirrhopoda, has been denied by all anatomists up to 

 the present time, but its presence in the larva or imperfect stages, is 

 very generally acknowledged. Several years since, having received 

 some living specimens of Balanus rugosus adhering to an oyster, he sub- 

 mitted them to dissection, in the course of which he noticed upon the 

 dark purple membrane which lines the shell and muscular columns 

 running to the opercula, on each side of the anterior middle line, a 

 small, round black body, surrounded by a colorless ring or space of 

 the membrane, which, upon submitting to a low power of the micro- 

 scope, he found to be an eye, composed of a vitreous body, having 

 nearly two-thirds of its posterior part covered by pigmentum nigrum, 

 and attached to a nervous filament, which he afterwards traced to the 



Peoc. Acad. Nat. Sci. of Phila., Vol. it. No. 1. 1 




2 . [Jan. 



supra-nosophapcal ganglia. The presence of this orrran in other species 

 or genera he had not yet had an opportunity of determining. (See 

 Plate, Fig. 4.) 



Dr. Pickering mentioned in confirmation of iho Balani possessing 

 the faculty of vision, that in their native situations, he had frequently 

 observed them suddenly retract their cirrhi, and close the opercula, 

 when the hand was passed over and above them. 



January 18<^,1848. 

 Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



Mr. Peter A. Browne read a paper, entitled "Reasons for believing 

 that animal torpidity is influenced by the annihilation, or interruption, 

 of electrical currents ;" which was referred to Dr. Bridges, Professor 

 Johnson, and Dr. Pickering. 



A letter was read from Henry Denny, Esq., dated Philosophical 

 Hall, Leeds, December 7th, 1847, addressed to the Secretary of the 

 Academy, presenting several numbers of the Proceedings of the Geo- 

 logical and Polytechnic Society of the West Riding of Yorkshire., 



On motion of Mr. Townsend, the Corresponding Secretary was 

 directed to present the thanks of the Society to Mons. A. Bovy, the 

 artist of a beautiful medallion of Baron Cuvier, presented by him 

 this evening through Mr. A. Vattemare. 



On motion of Dr. Leidy, the Corresponding Secretary was instructed 

 to inform Mr. Vattemare, that the Academy was prepared to com- 

 mence a system of exchanges of objects of Natural History, with the 

 Museums of Europe, as soon as lists of the especial wants of the latter 

 were made out and furnished to the Society, 



January 2bth, 1848. 

 Vice-President Morton in the Chair. 

 On motion of Professor Johnson, it was Resolved, That a new and 

 revisid edition of the " Notice of the Academy," be prepared under the 

 eupeiirtendence of the author, in such manner as to give a condensed 

 view :f the present state, as well as past history of the Institution, and 

 thatfi Te hundred copies be printed for the use of the Academy. 



On motion of Dr. Bridges, Resolved, That Peter A. Browne, Esq., 

 be requested to present to the Library of the Academy, a copy of his 

 paper, entitled "Reasons for believing that animal torpidity is in- 

 fluenced by the interruption or annihilation of electrical currents." 



The following Committees were elected for the ensuing twelve 

 months : 



Geological and Miner alogical.

February \st, 1848. 

 Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



A communication was presented, entitled, ''Descriptions of some 

 new plants collected by 3Ir. William Gambel in the Rocky Mountains, 

 and California, by Thomas Nuttall, F. L. S." Referred to Dr. Bridges.. 

 Mr. Gambel, and Dr. Zantzinger. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper '' On some peculiar bodies in the Boa con- 

 strictor, resembling the Pacinian corpuscles," which was referred to a 

 committee, consisting of Drs. Hallowell, Morton, and Bridges. 



llr. Cassin, referring the Academy to a paper by Professor Percy, " On the 

 management of Monkeys in captivity," published in the Proceedings of the Zoo- 

 logical Society of London, for 1844, made some remarks on that subject. 



He characterized Prof. Percy's observations as highly judicious and evidently 

 the result of much experience, — he (Mr. C.) wished however to point out the 

 fact, that in the enumeration of articles suitable for the diet of those animals in 

 confinement. Prof. P. had mentioned on animal food, except milk, an omission 

 difficult to account for, as Prof. P. observes in the same paper, " the Marmozet 

 eats spiders with great avidity." 



Mr. C. stated that it was a well known fact, that many of the American 

 species fed not upon fruit solely, but also upon insects, bird's eggs, and even 




4 • [Feb. 



birds, and be had also ascertained, that several African species not only devoured 

 insects with eiij^erness, but also cauglii iliein with great tiexterity. A speciioea 

 of the C>rrojiit/itrug snl'iriDi, observed Ijy him, was very fond of the common 

 cockroach, and upon beiu^c tarnished witli a daily supply of that insect, aclu.il!y 

 recovered perfect health after symptouH of disease had made their appearance. 

 This individual caught cockroaches with surprising adroitness, and when one 

 escaped, he would watch for it to reajipeur witli the patience and quiet of a cat. 



Mr. C. stated as bis opinion, that all the African monkeys (and perhaps all 

 others) were insect eaters, and to a |)erson aware of tlie large number and enor- 

 mous size of many of the species of Coleoplera of AfricH, it wood appear a reason- 

 able supposition that those insects were eaten by monkeys. 



All monkeys in conlinement should be furnished with animal food, either 

 insects, or raw mutton, or beef, cut into thin strips resembling worms, which he 

 had found to be the best substitute. 



Mr. C. stated that much of the disease of those animals in captivity, was 

 doubtless to be attributed to the fact, that they were invariably, as far as he had 

 observed, restricted to vegetable food. 



Ftbruary Sth, 1848. 

 Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



The Chairman read a letter addressed to hiui by Dr. Ft. W. Gibbe?, 

 dated Columbia, S. C., January 27tli, 1848, enclosing another from 

 Prof. Agassiz, addressed to Dr. Gibbes, dated Charleston, December 

 23d, 1847, and coinciding with him in the opinion that the JJcisilo- 

 saunis, of Harlan, or Zeuglodon cetoides of Owen, is generically dis- 

 tinct from the .species described by Dr. Gibbes under the generic name 

 of Donulon, and published in these Proceedings. The following is a 

 portion of the letter of Professor Agassiz : — 



" I have examined the interesting fossil remains of Cetacea which you left with 

 me yesterday. On one comparison, I have satisfied myself that Basilosaurus 

 or Zeuglodon cetoides, is generically distinct from your second species, which you 

 first described under the generic name of Dorudon. The hollowness of the te«th 

 cannot be indicative of a mere young age of that animal, as the form of the lower 

 jaw is altogether different in the two animals: Zeuglodon having a continuoas 

 fissure connecting the alveoli, and another groove along the edge of the jaw-bone. 

 v?bich are wanting in Dorudon. Besides, the posterior branch of the jaw is also 

 different, the two lamelhc of the bone rising to the same height, and much higher 

 in Zeuglodon, than in Dorudon, ■which has a deep depression upon its external sur- 

 face, owing to the difference in the height of the two laminse. Again, Zeuglodon 

 has deep pits upon the external surfaceof the lower jaw, showing that the teeth ot 

 the upper jaw left an impression upon the lower, resting upon it, as in the croco- 

 diles, of our days, when the mouth is shut. The other portions of the jaws of 

 Dorudon are from the upper jaw, the one with one tooth being from the left side, 

 the other with three teeth being from the right side. I am therefore sorry that 

 you have withdrawn your genus, in deference to the suggestion of Prof. Owen, as 

 he did not insist upon their generic identity, but rather alluded to the close a£5nity 

 of these remains. 



The isolated tooth, though imperfect, is highly interesting, as indicating a new 

 genus of Sauroid Cetacea, allied to Megalosaurus by the form of the tooth, but 

 differing by the form of its root. I would propose lo call it Saurc-cetus Gilbefii. 

 It will easily be distinguished from the fang of Dorudon, by its great flatness and 

 acute serrated edge. In the form of these anterior teeth there is another generic 

 difference between Zeuglodon and Dorudon, worth mentioning ; in the former 

 being blunt and short, whilst Dorudon has them acute and sharp upon the edges. 



I thank you for the opportunity you have afforded me to examine these highly 




1848.] 5 



interesting remains. As soon as I reach Boston, I shall avail myself of the op- 

 portunity of Dr. Warren's collection, to ascertain whether the Zeuglodon of South 

 Carolina is specifically identical with the large species of Alabama, which I begin

A letter was read from the Rev. Thomas S. Savage, addressed to Dr. 

 Hallowell, dated Natchez, Miss., January 15th, 1848, statincr that he 

 had drawn up some facts connected with the habits of three of the 

 specimens of Natural History from Africa, lately presented by him to 

 the Society, and had forwarded them with sketches of two of the 

 serpents in a recent state, with some account of them as connected 

 with the superstition of the natives of that part of Africa. 



A letter from William Thompson, Esq., addressed to Dr. Griffith, 

 dated Donegal Square, Belfast, January 11th, 1848, was read, acknow- 

 ledging the receipt of a donation of shells from Dr. Griffith and the 

 Academy, and returning his thanks therefor; also stating that he was 

 preparing to forward in return, a number of species of Echiaodermata 

 and Molluf-ca, and of Alyoe, about one hundred and fifty species ; and 

 also offering to transmit, if desired, specimens of Irish Cruatacea and 

 Zoophytes, also Cirrlu'puJa, Anuelidce, and Amorphozoa, and fossils 

 from the green sand formation of his vicinity. 



A letter was read from Dr. Charles T. Jackson, addressed to the 

 Academy, dated Boston, January 20th, 1848, relating to the proposed 

 erection in Paris of a monument to M. Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire, 

 and enclosing a printed circular on the subject, dated Paris, April 30th, 

 1847, signed by Dumeril, Arago, Dumas, Serres. L. Elie de Beaumont, 

 Jomard, Regnault, and Roche, and soliciting the co-operation of scien- 

 tific societies and individuals in this country. 



Professor Haldeman made some remarks on the fibrous lava of the 

 Hawaian Islands, and referred to the formation of a similar material ia 

 anthracite blast-furnaces. When the hearth of the furnace is some 

 what chilled, and the slag is not highly fluid, if the blast is allowed to 

 escape over it, it will be drawn out into long threads, which form 

 bunches resembling flax. According to Mr. Dana, the fibrous lava 

 (which Prof. H. proposes to call Sfypnite,) is formed from masses of fluid 

 lava cast into the air and struck by the wind. 



Dr. Morton offered some observations of the Bushman Hottentot boy, now in 

 this city, and who was brought here under the kind and paternal auspices of Capt. 

 Chase, United States Consul at the Cape of Good Hope. This gentleman has ex. 

 pressed his intention to be present, with the boy, at a future meeting of the 

 Academy ; and in view of this arrangement, Dr. M. stated that he should confine 

 his remarlis to a few very interesting points. The boy is supposed to be about 

 eighteen years of age, is three feet eleven inches in height, and of slender make. 

 His complexion is that of a dried leaf, as described by travellers among these 

 people; the head is elongated, flattened on the coronal region ; full behind, and ra- 

 ther broad between the parietal bones. The face does not project, the nose is so flat 

 as scarcely to be seen in profile ; the cheeic-bones wide, and the forehead low but not 

 receding. The hair is arranged in delicate tuft«, of a straight and cylindrical form, 

 each tuft being inserted separately into the scalp, so that the intervening light 

 skin. presents a strong contrast with the black hair. If these tufts are examined, 

 the hairs composing them are found to be spiral, and so intimately blended as to 

 give the whole fasciculus a compact appearance, and an extraordinary flexibility. 

 The hairs are very fine, but Dr. M. observed that his friend Dr. Meigs had called 




6 [Feb. 



Ills attention to the remarkable fact, that they are flattened, like tape, and as seen 

 under a power of forty or fifty diameters of Chevallier's nnicroscope, each hair has 

 the precise appearance of an ordinary steel watch-Bpring. Dr. M. had repeated 

 the experiments of Ur. Meigs, with chat gentleman's assistance, using one oJ 

 Oberhauser'i microstopes, with the same result. Dr. M. also adverted to a 

 piominence at or near the top of the sacrum, which, so far as he could judge 

 from a very imperfect examination of it, as covered with the boy's usual dress, 

 seems to be a prolongation of the spinous and triinsverse processes over the 

 region in question; and wliicli would appear to be the osseous frame-work of 

 that fatty cushion which is of proveibial occurrence in the Hottentot women. Dr. 

 M. expresed a hope that he might yet be able to examine this structure more 

 carefully, and report the facts to the Soci^'ty. The boy's head corresponds, in most 

 of its developments, to those of two Hottentot skulls in Dr. M.'s collection, sent 

 him by Mr. John Watson of Cape Town. The mental and moral questions con- 

 nected with the history of this youth, possess an extreme interest, but can only 

 be correctly judged of after more extended inquiries. 



Mr. Ashmead made some remarks on what he considered a peculiarity in the 

 calcareous spar, from the Kossie Lead mines in New York. 



The general form presented by fractured crystals of calcareous spar is 

 rhomboedrous. Cleavage is perfect parellel to the primary planes of a rhomb, and is 

 therefore three-fold. 



Some time since, while engaged in reducing to convenient size for the cabinet, 

 some specimens of double refracting spar from the above locality, he observed that 

 some of the fractured crystals were susceptible of mechanical division in different 

 directions from those of the planes of a rhomboedron ; this induced him to slice off 

 the laminaj wherever he found cleavage was perfect, and by proceeding with this 

 sort of dissection, the result was a nucleus, of perfectly geometrical form. It is 

 a solid, bounded by six isosceles triangular planesjof similar lustre, or two obtuse 

 three-sided pyramids, placed base to base ; it has but one axis passing through 

 opposite solid angles ; assuming the axis to be vertical, the base is an equilateral 

 triangle. As the faces are not parellel, but inclined to each other, it is suscepti- 

 ble of perfect cleavage in six directions. 



The solid angle of the apex is similar to the obtuse colid angle of the rhomb, 

 therefore, by truncating the alternate solid angles of the rhomb, this solid is 

 produced. 



On motion of Dr. Lcidy, the Corresponding Secretary was requested 

 to make some further inquiry of Dr. Joel Y. Shelley, of Berks county, 

 respecting the locality of certain fossils from his vicinity, and the 

 depth at which they were found by liini=

Descriptions of two new species of the Genus Cyanocorax, Boie, of which specimens 

 are in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



By John Cassin. 



Cyanocorax Harrissii nobis. Head crested, which, with the cheeks and 

 entire front of the face and neck, to the breast, are brownish black. Occipital 

 region and back of the neck, white, which color gradually blends into that of 

 the back. 



Upper surface of the body, wings and tail, glossy violet blue, darker on the 

 wings and tail. 



Under parts of the body, from the breast to the under tail coverts, including 

 the latter, of the same color as the back, but more tinged with cinereous. 



Inner webs of primaries, and under surfaces of the wings and tail, black. 



Bill and legs black. Tail without white. 



Total length of skin, from tip of bill to end of tail, about 14 inches, wings b 

 inches, tail 7 inches. 



Had. Guayaquil, South America. 



The specimen now described belongs to the Rivoli collection, and is labelled, 

 " Corvus de Guayaquil.^' 



This species belongs to the same group as C. cayanus, Linn, C. cayanopogon, 

 Weid., and others, but may readily be distinguished from any described species, 

 by the uniformity of the colors of the upper and under parts of the body, and 

 also by the entire absence of white on the tail. 



I have named this handsome bird in honor of Edward Harris, Esq., of Moores- 

 town, New Jersey, the early friend and associate of Mr. Audubon, and author 

 of various valuable contributions to the natural history of Xorth America. 



Cyanocorax concolor, nobis. Entire plumage glossy ultramarine blue, except 

 the inner webs of the primaries, and the under surfaces of the wings and tail, 

 which are black. Bill and legs black. No crest whatever. 




1848.] 27 



Total length of skin, from tip of bill to end of tail about 12 J inches, wing 

 62 inches, tail 6J inches.

Hab. South America. 



This species, of which one specimen in the Rivoli collection is now described, 

 is remarkable for the uniform color of its plumage, in which respect it differs 

 from any other species known to me. It is, however, more nearly related to 

 C. viridicyanus (D'Orb.) C. ornatus (Less.) and C, armillatus (G. R. Gray^ 

 than to any others, from which I infer that it is, in common with those beautiful 

 species, an inhabitant of the northern part of South America. 



The Committee on Dr. Leidy's paper, entitled " On certain bodies 

 resembling the Pacinian corpuscles in the Boa coEstrictor," reported in 

 favor of publication. 



On some bodies in the Boa Constrictor resembling the Pacinian corpuscles. 

 By Joseph Lkidt, M. D. 



"While engaged with my friend. Dr. Hallowel!, a few weeks since, in dissecting 

 the specimen of Boa constrictor presented to the Academy by Dr. Watson, I 

 observed along the course of the nervi intercostales, at or towards their anterior 

 extremity, a number of small, hard, rounded, or ovoid bodies, which, to the 

 naked eye, had very much the appearance of the corpuscula Pacini of man and 

 other mammifera, and such an opinion I expressed at the time to Dr. Hallowell. 



These bodies average from three to seven in number to each nerve, and 

 generally measure eight millemetres in diameter. They are white, shining, and 

 opalescent in appearance, and are closely attached to the side of the nerve, 

 enclosed within its sheath and projecting beyond its outline, instead of being 

 attached to a pedicle derived from an adjacent nerve, as in the Pacinian corpuscle 

 of man. 



Upon investigating the structure of these bodies through the aid of the micro- 

 scope, I find that they consist of a central, globular mass, measuring .33 mille- 

 metres in diameter, invested by a series of semi-transparent capsules in the neigh- 

 borhood of fifty in number. 



The central mass is semi-opaque, homogeneous, granular in structure, slightly 

 yellowish in color, and has in most cases a darker and more consistent nucleus 

 having apparently the same composition. Acetic acid had almost no influence 

 upon it. With the greatest care, and the use of the highest powers of the micro- 

 scope, I could discern nothing more than a finely granular constitution in it. A 

 somewhat analogous appearance I have noticed in the nervous structure in the 

 interior of the Pacinian corpuscle of the new-born child. 



The capsules enclosing the central mass form a stratum of the same or one- 

 third greater diameter ; ihey are perfectly distinct from one another, are farther 

 separated by the endosmosis of fluid, and have the same appearance as those of 

 the Pacinian corpuscle of man. Evidently fibrous, or composed of the white 

 fibrous element, they are rendered quite translucent by the application of aceti^ 

 acid. Upon their inner surface, at nearly regular distances from one ano- 

 ther, are situated projecting, elongated oval or fusiform, a few sigmoid, gran- 

 ular nuclei, larger than those of the Pacinian corpuscle of man, and measuring 

 .025 mil. in length, by .0075 mil. in breadth. 



The outermost capsules become blended with the white fibrous tissue, forming 

 the sheath of the nerve. No nerve fibril passes into the interior of these bodies? 

 although from their great resemblance to the Pacinian corpuscle I had expected to 




28 



[Feb. 



find such an arrangement. Generally I found them situated on one side of a nerve, 

 projecting from the bundle of nerve tubules and enveloped in the same sheath, 

 i)ut in several instances I found them scjjiirating, or situated between eeveral of 

 the nerve tubes, the tubes so separated, after passing the bodies, resuming their 

 position along with the others. Besides being invested by the nervous sheath, 

 they are more closely held in connection with the nerve by means of transverse 

 fibres of white fibrous tissue. After having thus discovered and examined these 

 curious bodies in the Boa, I expected to find the same in other serpents, and 

 I accordingly obtained a Coluber constrictor and Leptophia sauritus, into which I 

 carried my comparative researches, but without finding the least trace of a 

 similar or analogous structure. From their absence in these two serpents, it 

 occurred to my inind that they mightbe the ovaofentozoa — but the entire struc- 

 ture precludes any idea of this kind — and although they have several of the most 

 important elements of structure of the Pacinian corpuscle, yet they have no nerve, 

 of which as a conductor, if we consider the Pacinian corpuscle in any way the 

 centre of any kind of nervous or other power, must be considered as a sine qua 

 non : but if a mere filament of distribution, it would be comparatively of little 

 importance, and the close apposition of the bodies with the nerves in the Boa, 

 might possibly answer the same purpose. But if they are of the nature of the 

 Pacinian corpuscle, why not exist in all serpents? In this maze of perplexity, I 

 present these observations to the Academy, and hope that future researches will 

 throw some light upon the subject. 



Before finishing with these remarks, it may be important for me to state that I 

 saw none of these bodies in any other situation in the Boa, than along the nerves 

 mentioned, although I examined all other parts carefully, excepting the viscera 

 and their attachments.

A letter was read from the Rev. Dr. T. S. Savage, addressed to Dr. 

 Hallowell, dated Natchez, Miss., Jan. 10th, 1848, containing the follow- 

 ing interesting information, in relation to the habits of some specimens 

 of Natural History from Africa, recently prftsented by the writer to the 

 Society. 



" It was my intention to have made an earlier communication on the habits of 

 -several of the specimens of Xatural Historj-, which I sent to the cabinet of the 

 , Academy of Natural Sciences, from Liberia, but having been much occupied in 

 ■matters of higher moment, I hare not found the time to do it, and, even now, I 

 must defer my observations on the ants, &c. 



At the present time, I propose to give a few facts respecting but one specimen 

 of the Saurians, (of which I send several, some of which I think will prove to 

 be new) and two Ophidiam. 



1. Crocodilida. At this distance of time, I cannot say whether I found this 




1848.] 37 



to be an alligator or ffavial, but, my impression is, that it was the latter. The 

 question, however, you will be able to decide. It was captured at Cavalla, a 

 mission station of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and a coast town belonging 

 to the tribe of Africans called Grebos,the aboriginal inhabitants of the region of 

 Cape Palmas. Its local native name is the same as that given to the dog, which, 

 adopting as we do, the principles of Pickering for the reduction to writing of 

 the Indian languages, is written Kbinh, not easily expressed in English. 



Its habits are the same, in general, as those of the crocodile proper and alliga- 

 tor. It inhabits the smaller fresh water streams and standing water in the low 

 grounds, feeding on fish and aquatic reptiles. It digs a hole in the bed or banks 

 of streams for a temporary abode, whence it springs upon its unwary prey. It 

 deposits its eggs on the surface of the ground, and covers them over with leaves 

 and light trash, in which particular, it differs from the crocodile proper, and 

 alligator. It is timid and harmless, frequently taken by the natives and esteem- 

 ed highly for food. This individual would not have escaped the caldron, had 

 it not been for a fortunate junction of circumstances with their superstitions. 

 3. Ophidians. Amphisbcena. 

 I send a sketch taken soon after its capture, which accurately shows its colors 

 in a recent state. It was captured by one of my Missionary associates on the 

 beach. 



It is stated in works on Natural History, that its food is principally ants. I 

 am inclined to think this correct, as it is the opinion of intelligent natives in 

 Africa, from the fact, that this animal inhabits the domicils of the " white ant " 

 (Termes bellicosus of Smeathman, T. fatale of Linn.), and hence has received 

 the name of Nyonh-re-tedi, literally the white ant snake. 



It is not often visible, and its dubious character renders it an object of great 

 dread to the natives, it being considered dangerous to look upon it. It is con- 

 sidered an extraordinary Fetish, i. e., something that has the power in itself of 

 exerting a direct influence upon other bodies, for good or evil. Of this reptile 

 an evil influence is always predicted. 



Viper. (^Cerastes nasicornis, Hal., Proceed. A. N. S. Vol. TIL p. 319.) 

 The natives dread this serpent more than any other known. 

 It is very venomous — slow and sluggish in its movements — retreats from 

 man, except when trodden on, or opposed in its progress. 



It inhabits both high and low grounds, feeding on rats, the smaller reptiles, 

 and fresh water fish that inhabit the marshes. 



Its vicinity is known by a peculiar sound, somewhat like a suppressed groan . 

 this is succeeded by a hissing or blowing noise. The former is a warning that 

 every one acquainted with its habits remembers and knows well the necessity 

 of heeding; the latter indicates a readiness to bite. When it is about to make 

 an attack, it flattens its head and body, retracting itself upon its tail, and then, 

 with its mouth enormously distended, its fangs protruded, and eyes flashing 

 fire, it darts at its prey. It is said not to spring, but, with the latter part of its 

 body and tail fixed to the ground, to strike at its victim. 



The poison is very intense: generally it proves immediately fatal, but some- 

 times hours will intervene. It is probably modified in its action, in such cases, 

 by the difference of susceptibility in persons, superficial character of the wound 

 and perhaps other incidental circumstances. 




88 [April, 



The native treatment for the bite of this, and all other serpents, is, to tuck 

 out the poLvtn : make a free incision over the wounil, and ai)ply the juice of an 

 unknown plant, sometimes a strong (Iccoction of the same. Recovery is some- 

 times said to occur, but very rarely, however. A direct, deep flesh wound is 

 supposed always to prove fatal. 



The symptoms are, severe pain in the parts — rigors more or less palpable — 

 sensation of heat — vomiting — profuse perspiration and purging. If not much 

 reduction of vital energy attend, there is a possibility of recovery ; but if, on 

 the contrary, an early sickness comes on, there can be no hope — death soon 

 follows. 



A case occurred at one of our mission stations, supposed to be from the bite 

 of this viper, though it is not certain. A young man had V)een out in search of 

 Palm-nuts (fruit of the Elais guiniensU.) As he was returning, he heard the 

 warning tound, but knowing the habits of the reptile, and supposing it to be on 

 one side, he proceeded without precaution, and was bitten in the calf of his leg. 

 He represented himself as being immediately disabled. He halloed till some 

 one came to his relief, and was carried on the mission premises, which were at 

 hand. It is supposed that a half hour, perhaps an hour, had passed. The leg, 

 when first seen, was greatly swollen, nearly to the size of his thigh ; the skin 

 was tense and hot, with great pain in the surrounding parts. A free incision 

 was made, and the blood pressed out. Stimulants and narcotics were freely 

 given, and recovery succeeded. 



The intensity of the poison hag been manifested several times in the case of 

 dogs. One case of this kind came under my immediate notice. Some of the 

 mission scholars had permission to spend an afternoon in hunting. They pro- 

 cured for this purpose a valuable dog from a neighboring colonist. They had 

 not left the road for the thicket long, before they heard a piercing cry of dis- 

 tress from the dog. They ran immediately to the spot, where they saw this 

 viper, and the dog lying on his back, as if in convulsions. They shot the ser- 

 pent, aud carried them both to the road, by which time the dog was dead. 

 From a minute examination into the circumstances of the case, I was convinced 

 that not more than fifteen minutes could have transpired from the bite, to the 

 death of the dog. 



The original of the sketch I send you have in the cabinet. It was captured 

 on the high grounds of my own premises. In company with one of my asso- 

 ciates, I was drawn to the spot by the barking of our dogs. We found ihem 

 surrounding the viper, and not twice its length from it. It was retracted upon 

 itself, as already described, its body and tail flattened, and the latter acting as 

 a fulcrum ; from this, as a fixed point, it was darting forward alternately at the 

 dogs. At every stroke, its jaws were widely extended, its fangs protruded to a 

 fearful length, and its eyes rolled and flashed terribly to the beholder. My 

 companion, being a good marksman, succeeded in bringing down the serpent 

 without injury to the dogs. It measured as follows: — Length 3.9-12 feet; 

 greatest circumference of the abdomen 9.1-12 inches; width of the bead at 

 base 3 inches ; length of head 2.5-8 inches ; length of the horny processes over 

 the nose 7-16 of an inch. Its abdomen was considerably distended, on opening 

 which, three rats, and other food undigested, were discovered. 



It may not be irrelevant here to remark, that several cases of bites and stings 

 of venomous reptiles and insects, have come under my notice at Cape Palmas, 




1848.] 39 



which I have treated on the principles above stated. I have heard of deaths 

 from these causes, but none have fallen within my observation. One case, that 

 of a colonist, nearly proved fatal, but I supposedit was from the time the poison 

 had to act in the system before he came under treatment. He was a sawyer, 

 and was in the act of preparing a log for the saw, when he was bitten by a 

 snake which he observed retreating. Being int«nt upon his work at the time, he 

 did not get a good view of it, but said it presented a green aspect,probably another 

 species. He had bat one companion, who carried him on his back for two or 

 three hours, when he reached my premises. The wound was in the foot; this 

 was greatly swollen, as was also the leg as high as the kneee. He seemed to 

 be greatly prostrated and in great pain ; vomited several times a light-colored 

 watery fluid. I immediately administered, in large doses, strong rum and sul- 

 phate of morphine, and made a free incision over the wound. So reduced was 

 the vitality of the parts that scarcely any blood flowed at first, but a passive 

 hemorrhage came on subsequently, to stop which the blood vessels had to be 

 taken up and tied. The whole limb up to the groin, became enormously 

 swollen ; a bad sore followed from the incision, and the cuticle of the leg, to a 

 great extent, came off. He recovered at the end of three weeks. 



This statement is made in works on Natural History, and by travellers, that 

 the centipedes and scorpions of tropical climates are deadly poison. But 

 in respect to those of West Africa, it is incorrect. Many stings from both have 

 come within my notice, and have proved no more than the stings of bees and 

 wasps." 



Dr. Morton offered the following remarks on the ancient Peruvian 

 crania from Pisco, deposited by him this evening. 



He pointed out the fact that all the crania in his collection from this locality, 

 upwards of seventy in number, have been modified by pressure into artificial 

 forms, in one of which the head is extended or elongated in the upward direc- 

 tion, though in very different degrees, while in another class, the pressure has 

 been so applied, as to flatten the forehead, and to widen and elongate the whole 

 structure, in the manner yet practised by the Indian tribes of Oregon. Dr. 

 Morton read translations from the works of several of the earliest travellers and 

 historians of Peru, — Cieza, Torquanda and Garciloso de la Vega, containing 

 descriptions of these very forms of the head, and the artificial processes that 

 were then in use to produce them. 



Dr. M. concluded by remarking, that if no other evidence had descended ta 

 us than the statements of these authors, the facts would never have been be- 

 lieved ; but we have now abundant proof of their correctness, in the multitudes 

 of desiccated bodies that yet remain in the Peruvian cemeteries, and which, in 

 that dry climate, have resisted the ravages of time and temperature for hun- 

 dreds, and perhaps for thousands of years.

Notes on the Generation of the Virginian Opossum (^Didelphia Virginiana.) 



By John Bachman, D. D. 



Under an impression that the following extracts from notes made nt intervals 

 during the last ftw years, may throw some additional light on the natural his- 

 tory of one of the most interesting of American quadrupeds, I communicate 

 them for the information of the Society. 



March 1st, 1846. — Received to-day five female opossums, captured last night. 

 One of these had ten young in the pouch ; another nine ; the third had eleven ; 

 the fourth fourteen. They were all very diminutive, and appeared to be nearly 

 the same age— about two or three days. The fifth was a small animal of the 

 preceding autumn, and I was doubtful whether she had been impregnated. 



March 3d. — On the evening of this day, I examined my small female opossum. 

 The mammary organs were considerably distended, and I began to suspect that 

 I had erred in my previous conjectures, and concluded to dissect her on the fol- 

 lowing day. 



March 4th. — At 7 o'clock this morning, when prepared to commence my dis- 

 section of the opossum, I discovered three young in the pouch, and supposing 

 that so small a female would produce no additional number, I concluded that I 

 would spare her life. She was confined in a box in a room where I was writing. 

 When I occasionally looked at her I found her lying on her side, her body drawn 

 up in the shape of a ball ; the vulva appeared to reach the pouch, which was 

 occasionally distended with her paws. At 6 o'clock in the afternoon, as she 

 had appeared very restless for several hours, I was induced to examine her 

 again, when I discovered she had added four more to her previous number, 

 making her young fiunily now to consist of seven. With no inconsiderable 

 labor, and the exercise of much patienee, I removed three of the young from the 

 teat, one of which perished under the process. The three weighed twelve grains, 

 averao-ing four grains each. I replaced the two living ones in the pouch ; at 9 

 o'clock examined her and found the young again attached to the teats. 



The young were naked, blind, ears protuberances covered by an integument ; 

 mouth closed, with the exception of a very small orifice sufficiently large to 

 receive the small attenuated teat. Tail \ inch in length. 



March 11. — Weighed the largest of the young, and found that it had increased 

 to 30 grains. Length of body 1^ inch, tail J inch. The nostrils were now 

 open. The young were very tenacious of life, as on removing two they remained 




1848.] 41 



alive through a cool night in a room containing no fire, and still evidenced a 

 slight motion at 12 o'clock on the following day. The teats of the mother, 

 after the young had been gently drawn off, measured an inch in length, having 

 been much distended, and appeared to have been drawn into the stomach of the 

 young. 



March \^ih. — The dark color of the eye can be seen through the transparent 

 skin, but it is still perfectly closed. A few hairs have made their appearance 

 on the moustache. The orifice of the ears beginning to be developed. Nails 

 visible and sharp. The pouch of the young females is quite apparent, and the 

 sexes may be determined as soon as born. They voided urine and excrement 

 — used their prehensile tails, which were seen entwined around the necks of 

 others even at a week old. 



February and March, 1847. — Made a number of observations on a large number 

 of females. As they, however, all had young in their pouches before I procured 

 them, I will only notice one experiment made in order to ascertain the manner 

 in which the young became attached to the teats. 



March 11th. — Conjecturing that the young were aided by the mother in finding 

 the teat, and believing that she would not readily adopt the young of another, or 

 afford them any assistance, I removed six of the ten which composed her brood — 

 returned two of her own to the pouch, together with three others, fully double 

 the size, that had been obtained from another female. She was soon observed 

 doubled up, with her nose in the pouch, and continued so for an hour, when she 

 was examined, and one of her own small young was found attached to the teat. 

 Seven hours afterwards she was again examined, and both the small ones were 

 attached, but the three larger ones still remained crawling about the pouch. 



March 12th. — The mother seemed now to have adopted the strangers, and the 

 whole family of different sizes were deriving sustenance from her. 



February 11th, 1848. — Having received from the country a large female that 

 appeared to be impregnated, I this day dissected her. As soon as the uterus was 

 removed from the body of the animal, which had just been killed and was yet 

 warm, I observed the whole mass in irregular motion. There were nine young 

 that would evidently have been produced in one or two days. Three were con- 

 tained in one department and six in the other. They lay embedded in a thick 

 dark-brown mucous substance, which filled and greatly distended the sacs. They 

 possessed more life and motion than I had previously been led to suppose. One of 

 them moved several inches on the table, and survived two hours. I attempted 

 to weigh this uterine foetus, and as far as I could ascertain with an imperfect 

 pair of scale, it weighed 3 grains. 



Although naturalists at the present day could scarcely entertain a doubt that 

 the process of genoration in this species did not differ materially from those of 

 the Kangaroo and other Marsupialia, yet I am not aware that the young of the 

 Virginian Opossum had been previouslv detected in the uterus. 



The short period of gestation, the reluctance of many of them in copulating in 

 a state of confinement, unless perfectly domesticated, rendered the discovery one 

 of considerable difficulty. I have moreover found, that during the period of ges- 

 tation, the females, like those of some other species, particularly the Bear, can 

 seldom be found. 



In February, 184'7,by offering premiums to servants, I procured from various 

 localities, in three Dights,"35 opossums, acd there was not a single female in 




48 [April, 



the whole number. A3 soon, however, as the young were contained in the 

 pouch, I received more females than males. 



February 14th, 1848. — Dissected a small female that bad been captured six 

 days before. She proved impregnated, but in a much earlier stage of develop- 

 ment than the one I examined tliree days ago. On opening the uterus, I found 

 five on one side and seven on the other. These were nearly the size of a garden 

 pea, and resembled pellucid vesicles. Under a microscope the germinal mem- 

 branes represented a cellular structure as in other animals. The corpora-lutea 

 corresponded with the number of ova. 



The manner in which the act of copulation is effected is no longer a subject of 

 conjecture, although I have not personally observed it. An intelligent coloured 

 man in whose veracity I place great confidence, was requested five years ago to 

 watch this process. He assured me that he had observed the female receiving 

 the embraces of the male while lying on her side. Within the the last few weeks, 

 Dr. Middleton Michel of this city, an intelligent and close observer, who has 

 devoted much time to the investigation of this subject, has observed this process 

 with two female opossums which he has preserved in a domesticated state. He 

 informs me that they received the male whilst lying on their right side. 



From various observations I have made for the last three years, I had set 

 down the period of gestation in the opossum at 17 days. I received a female, 

 said by the servant to have been captured in the act of copulation. She pro- 

 duced her young on the seventeenth day. I had, however, placed her with a male 

 that I kept in confinement at the time ; but she exhibited such a savage temper 

 towards him, that for the sake of peace, I was compelled to separate them after 

 three days. Dr. Michel, however, informs me that a female in his possession, 

 produced young on the fourteenth day. Although I was at first confident that the 

 true period was 17 days, I think it probable that from the superior advantages 

 Dr. Michel has possessed with his animals in a state of domestication, he may 

 have approximated nearer to the true time than myself. 



la the second volume on American Quadrupeds, now in the course of publica- 

 tion, the history of this animal will be treated more in detail. 



Further Olservalions on the Generation of the Opossum. 



By the Rev. Dr. Bachman. 



February 15<A, 1848. — On the morning of this day I received five female 

 opossums from the country, three of whom I was informed by Col. Hall, (who 

 zealously and successfully interested himself in procuring specimens for my 

 examination), had produced young in the box in which they were confined, a day 

 or two previous to their having been sent. Their several pouches contained 

 eight, nine, and eleven young. There were two, as he informed me, in the state 

 in which I was anxious to obtain them ; as they had not yet produced their 

 younf. On examination, however, I discovered that one of the two had evi- 

 dently brought forth amid the jolting consequent on her conveyance from the 

 country. Five young were in the pouch. I observed, on examination, that a 

 sixth was lying at the bottom of the box, and was still living. Supposing it 

 possible that all the young had been excluded, I concluded to sacrifice the 

 mother ; and was repaid for an apparent cruelty, exercised very reluctantly, by 




1848.] 



43 



discovering that the female was still in the act of parturition ; a remaining 

 young one was found in the vagina, within half an inch of the external surface. 

 It was moving, head downwards, among a reddish-brown mucous mass, such as 

 had been previously observed in the uterus of a female already referred to. 

 There was not even the rudiment of a placenta. If it had previously existed, it 

 must have been ruptured in the passage of the foetus, and escaped my most care- 

 ful search. I was, however, under an impression that I discovered the slight 

 rudiment of an umbilical cord. The nostrils were open ; the lungs were filled 

 with air ; and, on a subsequent experiment, they were observed to float on the 

 surface of water. On dissecting the uterus it was found flaccid and nearly 

 empty, a slight brown mucus on the sides only being visible. 



On the afternoon of the same day I had the remaining female destroyed. On 

 dissecting down to the uterus, I found it greatly distended — full of young, and, 

 as I then supposed, near the period of production. There was a constant but 

 irregular motion in the various parts ; and I felt confident that I would now be 

 furnished with the long sought for opportunity of making a thorough investiga- 

 tion of the various particulars that required farther elucidation. I concluded, 

 however, previously, to have a drawing made of the uterus as it presented itself 

 in this state ; this consumed the remainder of the evening. As the weather was 

 warm I made a slight incision in the parts, and placed the whole in alcohol. On 

 the following morning, when, with a scientific friend, we entered on the exami- 

 nation, I was greatly disappointed and mortified, to find that the whole had been 

 so much dissolved by the alcohol that we could make no satisfactory examina- 

 tion. The young were lying in broken fragments in the midst of the unctuous 

 and now considerably diminished mass. I now can scarcely suppose that the 

 motion I had observed for an hour while the drawing was in progress could 

 have been any other than a muscular contraction and dilation of the diS'erent 

 parts of the uterus itself, and not of the young, which were evidently not suffi- 

 ciently advanced to have occasioned it. 



I would here observe that where the outward integuments of animals are so 

 very tender as those of young opossums a few days previous to their birth, it 

 is advisable to dilute the alcohol to more than half its original strength, as I 

 find the young one that was fully formed, taken from the mother a few mo- 

 ments before birth by the Csesarean operation referred to, has been preserved 

 in good order in alcohol thus diluted. 



In conclusion I will yet add a brief summary of the present state of our know- 

 ledge of the natural history of an animal, whose anatomical structure and 

 peculiar habits have led to the adoption of many vulgar errors, and produced 

 several contradictory theories among physiologists. We will thus be enabled to 

 see what important points still remain for farther investigation, and will at the 

 same time be gratified to observe that, although our progress in the investigation 

 of a singularly perplexed subject has been very slow, yet there has been a 

 gradual advance in our knowledge, leading us to the conviction, that in a very 

 few years the history of the opossum will be as correctly and familiarly known 

 to the community at large as that of the hare or squirrel. 



1. The interesting group of the Marsupialia has recently been arranged by 

 Owen into five tribes and families, and sixteen genera : these includ^ about 

 seventy known species, to which additions are continually making ; the Virgi- 

 nian opossum beuig, however, the only species known in the United States. The 




■14 [April, 



oateological cliaractcrs of the latter species have been so accurately described 

 and delineated that little remains to be added in this department. 



2. The organs of generation being found perfect and adapted to their peculiar 

 uses — the double uterus to the bifurcated organ of the male — should have in 

 themselves been sufficient to have thrown doubts on the assertions of our early 

 authors— Marcgrave, Pison, Valentyn, Beverly, the Marquis of Chastellux, 

 Pennant, and others — that ' ' the pouch was the matrix of the young opossum, 

 and that the mammae are, with regard to the young, what stalks are to their 

 fruits." 



3. The mode of copulation, although differing from that of the majority of 

 quadrupeds, is far from being the only exception to a general law ; our porcu- 

 pine (Hystrix dorsata) may be cited as another instance. In this respect the 

 actions of animals correspond with their peculiar organization, and the struc- 

 ture of the genital organs, as well as the whole anatomy of the opossum, are 

 in accordance with this habit. 



4. The question propounded in 1819, to naturalists, by Geoffroy, "Are the 

 pouched animals born attached to the teats of the mother?" is satisfactorily 

 answered. 



5. The period of gestation being between fifteen and seventeen days, is in 

 this respect shorter than that of any other known species (that of the Kangaroo 

 being thirty-eight days), suggests the idea of the probability of some modifica- 

 tion of uterine structure, approaching in some respects that of the birds and 

 ovoviviparous reptiles. 



6. Although the period of gestation is so short, the young are far more per- 

 fectly developed at birth than has been usually supposed. Tlie views of Blu- 

 menbach, who likens them to abortions, as well as those of Dr. Barton, (I 

 quote from Griffith as I have not recently seen the original) appear in this 

 particular suprisingly inaccurate. "The Didelphes," he says, " jnit forth, 

 not foetuses, but gelatinous bodies ; they weigh at their fii-st appearance 

 generally about a grain, some a little more, and seven of them together weighed 

 ten grains." My observations have convinced me that they are far from being 

 merely "gelatinous bodies," but that they are pretty well developed, indeed 

 nearly as much so as the young of the white-footed mouse and several other 

 species of Rodentia. They are covered by one integument — nourished by the 

 mammre — breathe through nostrils — are remarkably tenacious of life, and are 

 capable of a progressive movement at the moment of their birth. Hence I am 

 not fully satisfied with the accuracy of the terms used by De Blainville and Dr. 

 Barton — when they speak of two sorts of gestation — one uterine and the other 

 mammary. It is admitted that for so large an animal as the adult opossum, the 

 young are not only very small, but feeble , and are for several weeks sustained in 

 a kind of secondary domicil, termed the pouch, where they receive warmth, and 

 that they continue during this period firmly attached to the teats, which they do 

 not reliuquish till they are pretty well grown. It will be recollected, however, 

 that there is in several of our animals an approach to this latter peculiarity. 

 The white-footed mouse (Mus leucopus) ; the Florida rat (NeotomaFloridana), 

 and several species of Bats are known, the two former to travel, and the latter 

 to fly about for one or two weeks, with their young attached to their teats, and 

 that these young are not only blind and naked, but nearly as helpless as those of 

 the opossiim. It will be farther recollected that there are several species in 




1848.] 45 



the extensive group of Mammals to which the opossum belongs, that are desti- 

 tute of the pouch, the young in these cases adhering to the teats like those of the 

 Florida rat, &c., exhibiting an approach to species of a diflferent conformation- 



7. The manner in which the young are placed into the pouch and attached to 

 the teats, I have referred to in my observations on the female that brought forth 

 her young in the room where I was sitting, on the 4th of March, 1846, (although I 

 was not at the time aware that she was in the act of parturition). She was re- 

 clining in the corner of the cage, a little on one side, with her shoulders some- 

 what elevated ; her body was much doubled, the vulva nearly reaching the 

 pouch, the latter being occasionally opened by her paws. She was busily em- 

 ployed with her nose and mouth licking, as I thought, her pouch, but which I af- 

 terwards ascertained was her young. I came to the conclusion that she shoved 

 them into the pouch, and with her nose or tongue moved them to the vicinity of 

 the teats, where, by an instinct of nature, the teat was drawn into the small 

 orifice of the mouth by suction. I observed subsequently that the well-formed 

 young I extracted from the vagina, which I rolled in warm cotton, was instinc- 

 tively engaged in sucking at the fibres of the cotton, and had succeeded in draw- 

 ing into its mouth a considerable length of thread. I may here remark that on 

 the 21st of February of the present year a female opossum was sent to me late 

 in the evening. She had been much wounded on being captured, and died iu con- 

 sequence a few days afterwards. On the morning after I received her I perceived 

 in her pouch seven young ; they had not been attached and were dead ; abortion 

 had taken place, and they had evidently been placed in the pouch by the moth- 

 er's uncontrollable attachment to her oflfspring even after they were dead. 



8. The opossum is one of the most prolific of our quadrupeds. I consider the 

 early parts of the three months of March, May and July as the periods when 

 they successively bring forth ; it is even probable that they breed still more fre- 

 quently, as I have observed the young during all the spring and summer months. 

 I find in my notes the following memorandum : " May, 1830 In searching for in- 

 sects, I was removing with my foot some sticks comjiosing the nest of the Florida 

 rat. I was startled on finding my boot unceremoniously and rudely seized by 

 an animal which I soon ascertained was a female opossum. She had in her 

 pouch five very small young, whilst seven others, about the size of full grown 

 rats, were detected peeping from under the rubbish, and were captured.'' 



9. An interesting inquiry remains to be answered. Is the opossum a placental 

 or a non-placental animal? If I am to understand by this term, whether the 

 opossum has or has not a placenta, I can readily answer in the negative. In 

 these intricate matters the naturalist should, if possible, see with his own eyes, 

 and speak at all times as feeling himself firm on his own feet. I have had all the 

 opportunities I co\xld have desired of perfectly satisfying my own mind on this 

 subject, l)ut can only state that in all the examinations I have made I could never 

 find the slightest appearance of a placenta, and I do not believe that one exists. 



I am, however, far from being equally satisfied on another point, to which I 

 confess my observations were not directed until it was almost too late to make the 

 necessary investigations. Although I do not believe that a placenta exists, or 

 that there is any attachment of the foetus to the parietes of the uterus, it does not 

 from hence follow as a natural consequence that there is no allantois. If jn an- 

 imal has a placenta, there is a sure evidence of the pre-existence of an allantois ; 

 but there is in many animals, and especially among the smaller species of Mar- 




46 [April, 



8uplalia,'a modified structure in these parts; and the allantois, nmhilieal cord, 

 as well as the omphalo-mesenterif arteries and reins may exist in the absence of 

 a placfinta. In the very unsatisfactory examinations I liave l)een enaVilcd to make 

 on tills subject, I came to the conclusion that there was some reason to believe 

 that an allantois existed, and that there were some traces of the oniphalome- 

 sjiuterlc vessels running throuf,'h the mucous substance in which the young lay 

 imbedded. It is proper, however, to observe, that my friends Prof. Hume and 

 Drs. Harlbeck and Michel, who subsequently examined the well i)reserved spe- 

 cimen of the 15th, and the imperfect remains of the contents of the other uteri, 

 came to the very opposite conclusion. I nevertheless hazard the conjecture that 

 these appendages may yet be found in the uterus at an advanced stage of preg- 

 nancy. This suspicion, however, remains either to be confirmed or refuted by a 

 more favorable opportunity for examination. Owen, in describing, in 1S34, the 

 foetus aTul membrane of the Kangaroo at apparently the middle period of uterine 

 gestation, found its condition such as obtains in the viper and other ovovivi- 

 parous reptiles, there being no trace of the existence of an allantois. In 1837, 

 however (see Magazine of Nat. Hist., p. 481), having received another speci- 

 men in a more advanced stage, he found numerous ramifications of the um- 

 bilical vessels constituting a true allantois. The umbilical cord extended three 

 lines from the abdominal surface of the foetus. Having seen and examined that 

 specimen, I may have unconsciously formed a theory which has misled me in 

 conjecturing that I had observed a similar organization in the opossum. 



Letter from Middleton Michel, M. D., of Charleston, S. C. 



To the Rev. John Bachman, D. D. 



Dear Dk. — You will oblige me by adding the few facts which I am able to 

 State, concerning the habits and generation of our Opossums, to your valuable 

 communication, addressed to the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. 



1st. I have first noticed their mode of copulation, which though singular in it- 

 self, finds its explanation in the position and structure of the penis. The female, 

 after repeated solicitations on the part of the male, which are conducted as among 

 other animals, finally reclines upon her left side, being drawn into this position 

 by the male ; his front legs are employed in securing her, while the hinder ones 

 are made to pass on each side of the loins of the female, over and between her 

 hind legs. The penis, measuring two inches and more, is thus brought into more 

 immediate relation with the sexual organs of the female. Copulation lasted five 

 minutes. The sperm passes along the lateral canals, its only possible course, 

 as the bifurcated organ of intromission is received to some distance into them. 



2d. I have further determined, that the period of gestation is not twenty and 

 twenty-two days as has been believed. I placed a female with the male on the 

 27th of January, and on the 28th, at 7^ o'clock, A. M., I witnessed them en- 

 gaged in the act. She was left three days with the male, then isolated, and on 

 the 12th of February, fifteen days after the first coitus, had her young, six in 

 number, in the pouch. Admitting that the period may vary from fifteen to 

 seventeen days, the having settled this point I regard of paramount importance 

 in answer to another question to be shortly examined. 



3d. The rut begins in January and continues till June, as I have seen young 

 just received into the pouch during these months.

4th. The number of young is from six to thirteen. I have had a female with 

 thirteen in the pouch ; never less than five. 



5th. The size of the young at birth is four lines in length, two in breadth ; 

 weight four grains. 



6th. The structure of the male and female organs has been well described by 

 Cooper, Tyron, De Blainville, Home, and others. But I would remark that there 

 is no communication between the uterine extremity of the lateral tubes (or the 

 sinus, as I would term it,) and the vagina, as figured by Home and others. 



7th. This leads me to mention that parturition takes place as follows : the 

 young pass down through the lateral tubes, there being no other exit for them, 

 and immediately after parturition these canals are very much enlarged. 



The mode of transmission to the pouch is a part of the process hitherto un- 

 known, which I have recently witnessed as well as the nature of the circum- 

 stances would permit. The female stood on her hind legs, and the body being 

 much bent, the young appeared at the vulva; they were licked into the pouch. 

 They were born without any trace of an umbilical cord. The pouch was not 

 interfered with for some time, when her mouth was introduced into it while 

 her front paws held it open : after this manoeuvre was completed, the little ones 

 were all found attached to the teats. I would further remark that this attach- 

 ment is an instinctive act on their part, as it is impossible to conceive of any 

 interference of the mother eflFecting it. The mouths of the embryons present 

 but an infinitely small opening, compared with the size of the teat, and with 

 the hand it is an almost impossible attempt to attach them. 



8th. The ova in the vesicles are larger in proportion than in otner mammalia ; 

 the vitellus is enveloped by a thin vitelline membrane. The germinal vesicle 

 is, however, in the same position as in other mammals ; the transformation in the 

 tubes, where I have met with one, after fecundation, appears the same as in the 

 rabbit. In the uterus, the germinal membrane has the same structure and ap- 

 pearance as in the rabbit. This stage I witnessed, through Dr. Bachman's kind- 

 ness, as he gave me the uterus to examine. 



9th. Whether these animals be placental or non-placental, is a question which 

 I cannot positively decide until I have finished the series of observations pro- 

 posed, but the inference that they are not placental, is rendered legitimate, first, 

 by the peculiarities in the structure of the brain and other organs, which show 

 their close proximity to the bird ; second, by no allantois attached and convey- 

 ing blood vessels to the chorion ; third, by the short period of gestation ; for the 

 ova were discovered in the uterus on the ninth day, and the period of gestation 

 bein» fifteen or sixteen days would render such a structure needless.

bertson, the same gentleman who lately enriched our collection bj the deposit 

 of the cranium of Poeljrotherium, described in the number of the Proceedings 

 for Nov. and Dec, 1847. 



One of the fragments is a small portion of the upper jaw of the right side, con- 

 taining the posterior two molar teeth, and attached to a portion of the same 

 kind of matrix, which partially enveloped the cranium of Poebrotherium. The 

 two teeth are perfect, with the exception that the antero-cxternal demicone of 

 the penultimate molar is broken away. The penultimate molar has four fangs, 

 the iniernal ones of which are divergent from the external. The last molar was 

 just upon the point of protruding so that the crown only is formed. 



The other fragment is a portion two inches long of the right side of the infe- 

 rior maxilla, and contains the posterior three molars. The internal half of the 

 crown of the antepenultimate molar is destroyed, as is also a small projecting 

 point on the internal surface of the penultimate molar. The last molar is in the 

 same condition as the corresponding superior tooth. The external part of the 

 upper enameled surface of the crown of the antepenultimate molar is worn away 

 from the outside inwardly, as is also the edge of the same part of the crown of 

 the penultimate molar. 



The enamel is thin and about as rugose as that of Cervus virginianus. 

 The molars, like those of Merycopotamus,* have the antero-posterior cleft 

 dividing the primary lobes, forming two bends triangular convex, inwards in 

 the superior teeth, outwards in the inferior teeth ; producing a crown having 

 the ruminant pattern. 



The inner demicones of the superior molars are triangular convex. Their 

 inner surface inclines outwards from the base, at an angle of 65 degrees, and is 

 a very little concave in this direction. The outer surface is concave, inclined at 

 an angle of about 50 degrees, and runs into the outer demicones at the depth of 

 from three to three and a half lines from the apex of the latter. The exposed 

 part of their base is surrounded by a projecting ridge, about one-fifth of a line 

 deep on the anterior and posterior sides of the tooth, and perceptible internally 

 merely as a slight rising of the base, excepting opposite the interlobular depres- 

 sion, where a smalHrregular and rather inconspicuous tubercle exists, apparent- 

 ly formed by the union of the ridge of the two internal demicones at this point, 

 but no ridge passes from this tubercle outwards into the interlobular fissure as 

 in Mercycopotamus. 



The inner demicones fold around the external convexities of the external demi- 

 cones. The antero-external edge of the enamel fold of thepostero-internal demi- 

 cone projects a line or more between the postero-external edge of the antero-in- 

 ternal demicone and the postero-external demicone, causing the latter edge to 

 bend abruptly forwards towards the antero-external demicone. 



The points of the exterior demicones project above those of the interior, less 

 in the last than in the penultimate molar. The internal surface is triangular con- 

 vex, with a little vertical inclination. The external surface is concave from side 

 to side, nearly vertical, and is slightly elevated in a vertical line in the middle. 

 The postero-external angle of the postero-external demicone of the penultimate 

 molar, forms a strong, rounded, vertical prominence, which in the last molar is 



* Vol. 2, pi. 140, Fig. 8. 




1848.] 49 



considerably more developed, so as to prevent the appearance of an almost dis- 

 tinct conical column. 



Opposite the interlobular depression of the last molar, the exterior demicones 

 combine to form a strong and much projecting, triangular, vertical ridge, the 

 base of the triangle corresponding to the base of the crown. A similar ridge, 

 though not quite so prominent, exists at the antero-external angle of the antero- 

 external demicone. These ridges probably also existed in the penultimate molar, 

 •which is not capable of being determinedfrom the imperfection of the specimen. 

 These teeth diflfer from the molar tooth of the Merycopotamus, figured in 

 Owen's Odontography,* by being much smaller, the ridge along the base of the 

 inner demicones being neither so strong nor rugged, in the projection of the 

 enamel fold on the crown separating the antero-internal, from the postero- 

 external demicone, by the presence of the two strongly prominent external ridges, 

 and the absence or very slight development of the convex ridge at the bottom 

 of the external concavities. 

 The inferior molars, in general appearance resemble those of Dichobune, Cuv. 

 The exterior demicones are a little longer and about as broad as the interior 

 superior ones, and their external prismatic surface is not so much inclined. At 

 their base, on the front and back of the teeth, their exists a ridge corresponding 

 in its characters to that of the superior internal demicones. Between the two 

 demicones at their base, exists a triangular tubercle, apparently produced by the 

 union of the basal ridges of the demicones at this point. The supero-internal 

 face is concave, but does not descend so much as the corresponding surface of 

 the supero-internal demicones. 



The points of the inner demicones, when compared with the exterior ones, rise 

 higher than the corresponding or exterior demicones of the superior teeth. 



Their external surface is compressed triangular or nearly convex, and nearly 

 vertical. Internally they are more oblique, concave from side to side, but ele- 

 vated into a broad convex ridge in the middle. The posterior angle has the ap- 

 pearance of being slightly twisted inwards, so as to produce a small prominence. 

 Below the posterior prominent angle of the antero-internal demicone, and pro- 

 jecting from the base of the posterior demicone, is a small tubercle that looks 

 as if squeezed in the angle of separation between the demicones. 



In the specimen, the posterior molar has but two lobes, which if it be the 

 normal condition, would be a remarkable peculiarity among the ruminantoid 

 Pachydermata. A third lobe might have existed which has been broken off, 

 although the tooth has no appearance of such a loss. 



The breadth of the lower jaw, below the penultimate molar, is about equal 

 to that of Cervus virginianus, and internally, just above the base and parallel to 

 it, it is deeply depressed. The species I have named ",Culbertsonii," in honor 

 of the family, to whom science is indebted for the preservation of these inter- 

 esting remains.

May 2d, 1848. 

 Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Hon. George Bancroft, dated U. S. 

 Legation, London, 14th April, 1848, stating that he had received 

 from the Hon. East India Co. a proposal to present to the Academy a 

 series of casts of India Fossils in the Company's possession, and request- 

 ing instructions on the subject. 



Dr. Dickeson communicated a paper for publication in the Journal, 

 entitled " Microscopic examination of the development of the foetus of 

 the Succinia amphibia/' which was referred to Drs. Griffith, Hallowell, 

 and C. D. Meigs as a Committee. 



Dr. Morton read the following communication from R. W. Gibbes, 

 M. D., of Charleston, S. C. 



' "In June, 1845, I submitted to the Academy, an account of a non-descript fos- 

 sil from the Eocene of South Carolina. I expressed the opinion that it was 

 generically different from any previously published specimens, and called it 

 DoEiiDON serratns. Casts of the teeth were forwarded to Prof. Owen, by my 

 friend Dr. S. G. Morton. In the "Proceedings " of the Academy of Feb. 1846, 

 a notice appeared that a letter had been received from Prof. Owen, of London, 

 dated November 11th, 1845, in reference to the fossil genus Borudon. He con. 

 sidered it to be the same as his genus Zeuglodon (Basilosaurus, Harlan,) to which 

 also he referred the very extensive series of bones collected by Dr. Koch, in 

 Alabama, then on exhibition in London. 



Prof. Owen's letter was kindly forwarded to me by Dr. Morton, who wrote 

 me that he considered Prof. Owen's authority as decisive, and that I must yield 

 my genus, requesting me at the same time to prepare for the Academy's Journal, 

 then about to be resumed, a paper on the present knowledge of Zeuglodon. In 

 deference to such high authority, I yielded the genus, though in my reply I ex- 

 pressed the opinion that I still thought the character different. In my paper 

 published in the first number of the Journal, I described Dorudnii as a second 

 species of Zeuglodon, giving Prof. Owen's letter, and stating the characters upon 

 which I had made its generic distinction, expressing the opinion that what I had 

 considered a very important character, " should not be set aside." 



On a visit to Charleston, in December last by Prof. Agassiz, I took the op- 

 portunity of submitting the specimens (some of which he had not seen) again to 

 his critical inspection, and the result was that he adopts all the characters upon 

 which I had based the genus, and upon his authority I respectfully reclaim the 

 genus DoRUDON. 



The following letter he kindly sent me in relation to the specimens, as well 

 as to his discovery among my fossils of a new genus, which he names 

 Sadrocetus."*

 Vice President AIoinoN in the Chair. 



Dr. Pickering called the attention of the Soeiety to the fact that in 

 all the estimates relatinj^ to the len^^lh of the year, no reference had 

 been made to the time taken for lif^ht to reach us from the sun, about 

 eic!;ht minutes and a half. He supposed that if that estimate was 

 taken into the calculations, a slight difi'erence would be I'ound in the 

 results. 



Dr. Bridges remarked that the same estimate was taken at the com- 

 mencement of the calculation as at the end — that the relative position 

 of the sun to the earth was the same at both times; and he asked if 

 the consequence was not, that the length of time between each posi- 

 tion so estimated would be precisely the same as if the allowance 

 spoken of by Dr. Pickering was made 1 



The effect of making such allowance would only be to add eight 

 minutes and a half to each end, which would, of course, leave the 

 difference between such ends the same as before. 



Dr. Meigs offered some remarks on the mode of copulation in the 

 Opossum, which he felt satisfied was performed more canino, as ob- 

 served by Dr. EUerslie Wallace of this city ; and that the statements 

 contained in a recent communication to the Academy on this subject, 

 by Drs. Eachman and Michel, that the connection look place in a 

 lateral ]iosition, were erroneous. 



May 16th, 1848.

 hundred and five new fossils of that period, from the vicinity of 

 Vicksburg, Mississippi, with an appendix," read on the I2lh October.

Dtscriplion. of two new species of Onycliocfphalas, from the Wesleni Coast of 



Africa. 



By Edward Hallowell, M. D. 



Onvchocephaltts. Dumeril and Bibron. 



Generic Characters. — Head provided with plates: depressed, terminating in 

 front in a thin or cutting edge. Rostral plate folded under the snout, and expand- 

 ing as a disk upon the head of variable form. An anterior frontal, a frontal pro- 

 perly called, a pair of supra-oculars, a pair of parietals, an inter-parietal, a pair 

 of nasals, a pair of fronto-nasals, a pair of preoeulars, a pair of oculars. Nostrils 

 hemidiscoidalj opening inferiorly between the nasal and the fronto-nasal. Eyes 

 lateral, distinct. 



Onychocephalus Liberiensis. (See Plate, fig* 1 and 2.) 



Specific Characters. — Length of tail equal to transverse diameter of head taken 

 at its middle; tail incurvated, conical, terminating in a spine ; the upper portion 

 of the rostral plate very convex, quadrilateral, its cutting edge slightly arched, not 

 extending across the snout j colour above blackish variegated with yellow; under 

 surface yellow, with black spots upon the sides. 



Descriptioti, — Head rather small, wedge shaped above, rounded anteriorly ; the 

 rostral plate is large, convex superiorly, presenting four sides at its upper sur- 

 face ; of these the posterior is rounded where it lies in contact with the anterior 

 frontal; the lateral margins are slightly curved, and are in contact with the 

 fronto nasal ; the anterior margin forms a projecting convex edge where it is 

 continuous with the under surface of the rostral which is four-sided; the lateral 

 margins of this under portion of the rostral are concave, so as to receive the nasal 

 plates which lie along their exterior border ; the inferior margin is the most nar- 

 row, its middle portion (about one-third of it) projecting backward, and form.ing; 

 part of the margin of the upper lip ; the nasal plate is long and narrow, broadest 

 near the middle, being somewhat triangular in shape, the apex presenting forward ; 

 the nostrils are elongated narrow slits, looking outward and backward, and are 

 placed in the fronto-nasal suture, formed by the juxtaposition of the nasal and 

 fronto-nasal plates ; the fronto-nasal are narrow and oblong, much broader below ; 

 anteriorly they lie in contact with the rostral, presenting a slightly undulating 

 line at their junction; the posterior margin is deeply incurvated except toward 

 its superior extremity ; it lies in contact with the preocular which is received 

 into the hollow formed by its posterior margin ; the preocular has the form of an 

 oval disk with a superior and inferior extremity, which are pointed ; the ocular 

 plate, which is immediately behind it, is very large; its posterior margin is con- 




60 [May, 



vex, the anterior concave ; the eye is placed in the angle formed by the junction 

 of the preocular, and the supraocular; the latter is a narrow, oblong plate, with 

 a rounded posterior margin ; the anterior frontal is a large plate immediately in 

 contact with the rostral, measurin;^ two lines in its transverse direction in the 

 specimen examined; its posterior margin is rounded; the frontal is a very small 

 plate compared with the anterior frontal, also with a rounded posterior margin : 

 it is in contact in front with the anterior frontal, and with the preocular; im- 

 mediately behind it is the inter-parietal which is less extended in the tranverse 

 direction than the frontal, and its posterior border is much less convex than that of 

 the former pluto, and of the scale behind it ; the inter-parietal are placed imme- 

 diately behind the supraocular and the posterior frontal, and are in contact at their 

 internal margin with the frontal, and externally with the ocular; the supra-labials, 

 four narrow, elongated plates, margin each side of the upper lip ; that nearest 

 the angle of the mouth is the longest; the eyes are small, but distinct, placed 

 upon the side of the head near the superior extremity of the preocular; scales upon 

 the chin, neck and throat small, increasing in size upon the body and tail, where 

 they are of nearly uniform size ; these scales are rounded posteriorly, more ex- 

 tended transversely than in length. There are 2S longitudinal and 369 transverse 

 rows upon the body, and 11 rows upon the tail. 



Cvloratio7i. — Above brownish, approaching to black, clouded with yellow: 

 under surface yellow for the most part, presenting a few spots of black, chiefly 

 upon the sides. 



Dimensiotis. — Entire length 2 feet 4 lines: length of head 5 lines; greatest 

 breadth 4 lines; length of tail 5 lines ; greatest circumference of body 2 inches, 

 9 lines. 



Habitat. — Liberia, Western Coast of Africa. A specimen in the Museum of 

 the Academy. 



Habits. — Dr. Savage informs me that this animal inhabits the domicils of the 

 " white ant'" (Termes bellicosus of Smeathman,) which probably constitutes its 

 food, and hence has received the name of Nyoiik-re-teai, literally the white ant 

 male. (See Proceed, for April, 184S, p. 37.) Its tenacity of life is very re- 

 markable. 



Onyehocei)lialus nigro-lineatus , (See Plate, fig. 3.) 

 Specif c Characters. — Tail short, of same length as head measured transversely; 

 rostral plate four-sided, longer than broad, rounded posteriorly, the sides slightly 

 convex; nostrils in the fronto-nasal suture; body cylindrical, slender, presenting 

 numerous lines of black upon a ground of silvery grey. 



Description. — Head small, depressed, convex in front, rostral plate more ex- 

 tended in the longitudinal direction than transversely, its sides slightly convex, 

 rounded posteriorly ; the under part of the rostral is urceolate in form, having a 

 small projection at its posterior extremity; it is somewhat excavated laterally, 

 passing backward between the nasal plates; it presents a well defined edge, at 

 the line of demarcation between its superior portion, extending across it; the 

 nasal are narrow, oblong plates, placed between the fronto-nasal, and the rostral 

 at its inferior part, in contact above with the fronto-nasal ; the fronto-nasal are 

 situated above between the rostral and the preocular ; they are much more nar- 

 row superiorly than at their inferior portion, where they are in contact with 




184.8.] 61 



the nasal; the nostril, the greater part of which is in the fronto-nasal, occu- 

 pies the fronto-nasal suture ; the anterior frontal is a well defined plate lying 

 immediately posterior to the rostral, and in contact also in front with the 

 fronto-nasal plates, this portion beinjr excavated to receive the corresponding por- 

 tion of the latter; it is convex upon its posterior border, where it is in con- 

 tact with the posterior frontal and the supraocular, the latter being exterior to 

 it, and also to the fronto-nasal ; the preocular is triangular in form, its widest 

 part being downward, lying in front of the ocular and in contact with the supra- 

 ocular ; the eye, which is small, but distinct, is placed in the angle formed by 

 those two plates; the ocular is large, convex upon its posterior border; it is 

 in contact above where it forms an acute angle, with the inter-parietal superiorly 

 with the supra-ocular, anteriorly with the preocular, and inferiorly with the 

 superior labials; the frontalis much smaller than the anterior frontal; it has 

 immediately behind it the inter-parietal, and upon the external aspect of its pos- 

 terior border the parietal; the inter-parietal is a small plate resembling the frontal 

 in form, but smaller; the parietals are more extended in the transverf=p direction 

 than longitudinally ; in front they touch the ocular and supraocular, latero-exter- 

 nally the frontal, and posteriorly the inter-parietal; four small quadrangular plates 

 margin the upper lip on each side; the eyes are latero-superior placed as above 

 mentioned; the body is slender, of nearly uniform size, somewhat thicker near the 

 middle, covered with scales which are broader than they are long, presenting a 

 rounder margin posteriorly, somewhat smaller near the head than upon other 

 parts of the body; of these scales there are 29 longitudinal, and 344 transverse 

 rows; there are 16 rows upon the tail ; the tail terminates in a pointed spine. 



Coloration. — (From a specimen in spirits.) The entire under surface of the 

 animal is yellow, without spots : the back presents 10 narrow black lines, ex- 

 tending from the head to the extremity of the tail ; of these the two exterior are 

 less distinct than the rest; the three central ones become broader toward the tail; 

 the intervening portion is white or silver grey. 



Dimensions. — Length of head 2 lines ; greatest breadth transversely 2} lines ; 

 length of tail 2 lines; length of body S inches 2 lines, (Fr.;) greatest circumfer- 

 ence 7 lines. 



Habitat. — Liberia, West Coast of Africa. Specimen in the Museum of the 

 Academy. 



General Observations.— The reptiles above described, belong to the first section 

 of the Ophidians, described by Dumeril and Bibron; viz., the Scolecophidians,* 

 or vermiform non-venomous serpents. There can be no doubt, we think, that 

 they are new. But three species of the genus Onychocephalus are described by 

 them in their "Erpetologie generale, ou HistoireNaturelle complete des reptiles," 

 which contains descriptions of all the species of reptiles known; they are the 

 Onychocephalus Delalandii, multilineatus, and unilineatus. The first is figured in 

 the work of Dr. Andrew Smith, upon the Zoology of Southern Africa, and does 

 not bear the least resemblance to either of them, diSering from both in size and in 

 the relative proportions of the head and tail, and in its coloration, being of an uni- 

 form brown color, both upon its upper and under surface. In multilineatus, the tail 

 is double in length the breadth of the head, and the body presents a series of white 

 lines upon a ground of silvery grey. In unilineatus, a single black line passes 

 along the median line of the back, which is of an olive-brown color.

By Kdwakd Ham.iiwei.f., M. I). 



The animal is youiift, moasuriii;; about fourteen inclius in ien;;th. 



Head. — Brain not examined. 



Thorax. — The upper lobes of tlie riijht Inn;; arc firnrily adherent to the pleura ; 

 the whole of this portion of the lung is infiltrated with tubercular matter, firm to 

 the touch, and having a white caseil'orm appearance: the entire mass measures 

 three inches in length, by two in breadth, French measure, the lowest lobe of this 

 lung is of a'brick-dust red colour; presenting numerous tubercles immediately 

 beneath the pleura, varying in size from that of a grain of sand to two lines and 

 a half; the two lobes of the opposite lung are slightly adherent, and studded with 

 tubercles, the largest of which measures five lines, in its greatest extent; the gene- 

 ral colour of this lung is reddish-brown. The tubercular infiltration above men- 

 tioned occupies the whole of the upper lobes of the right lung which have a uni- 

 formly dull white colour throughout, and are resisting to the touch ; the lowest 

 lobe is partially hepatized, containing a number of tubercles, most of which are 

 observed immediately beneath the pleura; the base of the right lung is partially 

 adherent to the diaphragm. There are two distinct lobes to the left Itlng, the 

 upper presenting a slight fissure upon its anterior border; the tissue of both is im- 

 perfectly crepitant, containing numerous tubercles deposited near the surface of 

 the lung beneath the pleura; the largest of these measures four lines in diameter; 

 the lining membrane of the oesophagus is pale, having a slight rosy tint and 

 appears healthy ; the mucous membrane of the trachea and bronchi is pale ; the 

 bronchial glands are tuberculous, but not remarkably enlarged. Heart — The 

 two surfaces of the pericardium are adherent throughout, their separation 

 requiring some effort ; the external surface of the heart is covered in nearly 

 its whole extent with a thin layer of false membrane of a slightly yellow colour, 

 giving it an appearance of roughness ; the general colour of the pericardium is 

 pale with a tinge of redness; upon the surface of the heart, imbedded in its 

 tissue, immediately beneath the pericardium are several small tubercles, having 

 the same aspect as those of similar dimensions found in other organs ; the ven- 

 tricles are empty containing no coagula. 



Ahdomeu. — The liver is divided into four lobes, one of which presents two 

 small subdivisions , it is of a brownish red colour ; about a dozen scattered 

 tubercles, the largest having the size of millet seed are observed in its subperi- 

 toneal tissue ; it measures four inches transversely, by two inches four lines in 

 its longitudinal diameter, and fourteen lines in depth; its tissue when cut into 

 presents nothing remarkable ; the gall-bladder is moderately distended with bile 

 of a brown colour and almost fluid consistence. Spleen. — The spleen measures 

 two inches en lines in length and fifteen lines in its greatest breadth ; it pre- 

 sents upon its convex surface numerous elevations, caused by the deposition 

 of tuberculous matter within its tissue, giving it a highly bosselated appear- 

 ance, resembling in some degree the cancerous deposits observed in the human 

 liver; the largest of these measures seven lines in diameter, and is elevated 

 about three lines above the surface of the spleen ; the tuberculous deposite 

 resembles in colour that of the lung, and appears to be composed of numerous 




1S4.8.] 63 



agglomerated granules; ten of these large masses may be counted upon its sur- 

 face; the general colour of the spleen is brownish-red. The stomach measures 

 three and a half inches transversely, by two inches four lines in its small diameter 

 when moderately distended; the fibres of its muscular coat are seen very distinctly 

 through the peritoneum ; it is quite pale externally, and no tubercular deposites 

 are observed upon it ; it contains a large quantity of pultaceous matter resem- 

 bling thin gruel mingled with portions of a bright yellow colour ; the mucous 

 membrane is pale, presenting, however, a slate coloured tinge, which is most 

 marked at its pyloric portion, where it is much softened; the mucous fol- 

 licles are not apparent. The large, intestine contains a considerable quantity 

 of fcecal matter, of a bright orange colour throughout; the lining membrane is pale; 

 the small intestine measures seven feet, eight and a half inches in length; the 

 large intestine measures ten feet, three and a half inches in extent, exclusive of 

 the caecum, which is two and a half inches in length; there is no appendicula 

 vermiformis i the mucous membrane of the large intestine is much corrugated, 

 but pale and apparently healthy. The mucous follicles are quite distinct when 

 the intestine is held up to the light ; there are no valvulce conniventes in the 

 small intestine, nor are any glands of Peyer to be seen ; the solitary glands 

 of the small intestine also, are not apparent ; the mucous lining of the small in- 

 testine is quite pale throughout, and no tubercles or ulcerations are observed in 

 any part of it, or of the large intestine; it contains a quantity of brownish looking 

 matter. The general appearance of the large intestine, viewed externally, is pale, 

 with a slight rosy tint, in portions mingled with yellow, the latter colour being 

 that of its contents ; no tubercles are observed in the subperitoneal tissue of 

 either the small or large intestine; several of the mesenteric glandr are enlarged, 

 the largest being six lines in length, by five in breadth. The kidneys, when cut 

 into, present nothing remarkable ; no tubercles are observed upon their surface ; 

 X\ie pancreas is a slender organ, measuring four inches (Fr.) transversely, by half 

 an inch in breadth, of a brownish colour, throughout presenting no tubercles ; 

 lladder pale. 



The Committee on the following communication by Major McCall, 

 reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Some Notes on Mexican. Birds, heretofore not fully described. 



By George A. McCall, U. S. A. 



Orpheus czirvirostris,* Swainson. 



Length 10 inches, 5 lines. The bill is curved and rounded on the ridge, the 

 upper mandible slightly projecting; measured on the ridge it is 1 in. 2 1.; the 

 commissure 1 in. 5 1., its colour dusky. Irides bright carmine, of conspicuous 

 lustre; indeed, the eye is a striking feature of this bird. Tarsus rather robust, 

 and 1 in. 5 1. in length; middle toe and nail 1 in. 3 1. 



General colour above, light hair-brown, fading to an ash-colour about the head, 

 while towards the tail it deepens to chesnut. The feathers of the back are 

 loose-webbed; and all the feathers at base are slate-colour. Chin, throat, breast 

 belly and vent, whitish ; the breast obscurely mottled with light brown. Pri- 



•Called by Mexican peasants " Ouitacoche,' 




til [Jl'NE, 



maries iluskVi eJgeJ with white on the outer vanes ; greater and lesser wing 

 coverts hair-brown, also slightly tippptl with whitish. Lower tail-coverts hair- 

 brown, broadly edgp(i and tipped with whitish. Tail of twelve feathers, chesnut; 

 the two middle ones loose-webbed, the three exterior tipped with white. 



There is little difference between the sexes ; the female is perhaps a trille less 

 in size, and its general marking are more obscure. 



O. ciirvirostris is rather common about Matamoras,. (Mexico.) The Pong of 

 the male is a clear warble, not unlike the native notes of the mocking; bird, but 

 he has neither the imitative powers nor the volume of voice of the latter. On 

 the Rio Giande this bird nested in the hedge rows near the farm houses, and was 

 constantly seen perched upon their roofs, singing with much volubility and all 

 the familiarity of the house-wren. 



CoLt" MBA leiicoptera, Linn. 

 C. Trudrauii, or Texan Turtle Dove, Audubon. 



This very graceful bird — one specimen of which only Audubon mentions as 

 having been received or seen by him — was exceedingly abundant at Matamoras, 

 in May and June, (1846,) large flocks daily feeding in our camp, and with re- 

 markable confidence approaching quite near the tents. But although common in 

 Mexico, I have some doubts as to the propriety of its being denominated a Texan 

 Dove ; for I never saw it in Eastern Texas, neither did I while on an extensive 

 hunting excursion, which embraced the country along the Neuces River for 

 seventy miles above Corpus Christi, see a single individual of this species, 

 although game of every description was most abundant. Nor did I see ene on 

 the whole route from the Neuces to the Rio Grande, until we crossed the latter 

 river into Mexico. Mr. Audubon's specimen was, therefore, possibly but a 

 straggler from the neighboring Republic. 



About the last of June they disappeared from the vicinity of Matamoras, and 

 passed probably to the interior. In January following I shot a few stragglers, 

 on small streams, near the Sierra Madre.. 



For the table, this bird is far superior to C. Carolinensis, the breast being 

 larger and fuller, and the meat of quite a delicate flavor. And in its style of 

 flight it resembles C. ^>ias more thanC Carolitie7isis. 



The female diff'prs but little from the male, except that the metallic reflections 

 on the neck, &c. &c. are less vivid

Descriptions of new species of Birds of the genera Vidua, Briss. ; Euplectus, Su>. ; 

 Pyrenestes, Sw. ; and Pitylus, Cuv.; specimens of which arc in the collection, 

 of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 



By John Cassin. 



Vidua alhonotata, nobis. 



Shoulders yellow. 



Primaries white at their bases, and for about one-third of their length. 

 Greater wing coverts also tipped with white, which, with that portion of the 

 primaries of the same colour, forms a conspicuous white spot on the wing. 



10 




56 [June, 



Lesser wing coverts lipped with brown. 

 All other parts of the plumage glossy black. 

 Bill light blue, at the edges of the mandibles pearly while. 

 Total length (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail about C^ in , wing J, tail 

 3 3-lOth inches. 



Hab. Port Natal, Eastern Africa. 



This bird belongs to that group of species which appears to form the genus 

 Coliuspasser, Ri'ippel. From either of those species (V. Jluvoplera, Viell. ; 

 V. ))iacrocerca, Licht. ; V. axillaris, A. Smith and others,) it may readily be dis- 

 liguished by the white spot on the wing, and the pearly character of the 

 bill. 



Three specimens of this interesting species are included in the many valuable 

 acquisitions of the Academy made through the judicious exertions of Mr. Edward 

 Wilson, who secured them in Paris. 



Vidua concolor, nobis. 



Plumage entirely black. 



Bill strong, conical. 



General form and appearance of Vidua payanensis, Gm., (V. ruhritorqucs, 

 Swainson,) but the bill is larger, and the tail and wing feathers are broader, 

 with no vestige whatever of the red collar which characterizes that species. 



Total length (of skin) from tip of bill to end of tail about 12 inches, wing 

 2 S-10 ; tail Si inches. 



Hab. Africa. 



Of this species one specimen only is in the Rivoli collection, without label. 

 It is closely allied to the Vidua ruhritorques, Swainson, but has the bill larger 

 than either of ten specimens of the latter which I have examined. The entire 

 absence of the red collar is, however, the most striking comparative cha- 

 racter. 



Ei;PLECTES nigroveiitris, nobis. 



Entire upper parts of the plumage bright scarlet, except the wings and tail, 

 which are hair-brown, with paler margins. 



Cheeks and entire under parts (from the base of the bill) deep black, except 

 the thighs and under tail coverts, which are pale reddish-white, j 



Hab. Zanzibar. 



Total length, from tip of bill to end of tail, about 1} inches, wing 2 3-lOths, 

 tail li inches. 



This species, one specimen of which from the Rivoli collection is now 

 described, is more nearly related to Eiiplectes flammicej^s, Swainson, than to 

 any other species known to me. From that species, as well as from all others 

 of this genus, in which the bright scarlet plumage predominates, it may easily 

 be distinguished by the uniform deep black of the entire under surface of the 

 body. The inferior tail coverts and thighs are pale reddish white in the speci- 

 men now described, but I suspect that in the more adult bird, they become 

 scarlet, and also that the wings and tail become darker. 




1848.] 67 



PvRENESTES cocciiietis, noils. 



Head, neck, rump, upper tail coverts and flanks, glossy crimson. 



Upper surface of the tail of the same colour, but not so glossy. 



All other parts of the plumage, brown, some feathers of the back and a few 

 of the wing coverts margined with red. 



Hab. Western Africa. 



Total length from tip of bill to end of tail about 4 4-lOths inches, wing 

 2 .3-lOths, tail 1 9-lOths inches. 



Very similar in colour to Pyrenestes ostn'inis, (Viell.) but is much smaller and 

 less robustly organized. The bill especially is comparatively weak. 



In the species now described the crimson does not extend to the breast as in 

 P. ostri?ius. 



The measurements of the twi species are as follows : 



P. ostriiius, (Viell.) P. cocciii.eus, Cassin. 



Total length (of skin) from tip 



of bill to end of tail about 5 G-lOths inches. . 4 4-lCths inches. 



Length of wing from flexure 



to tip of longest primary 2 8-lOths " . 2 3-lOths " 



Length of tail . . . 2 4-lOths « . 1 9-lOths " 



Length of bill from gape . 7-lOths " . 5-lOths « 



Breadth of under mandible . 7-lOths « . 5-lOths « 



The dimensions of the specimen of P. ostrlnns here given, agree almost 

 exactly with those given by Mr. Swainson in birds of Western Africa, 

 (Vol. I. p. 158) and also with Viellot's plate Ois. Chant, pi. 48, 



For a fine specimen of the rare Pyrenestes ostrinus, (Viell.) the only specimen 

 in the collection of the Academy, we are again indebted to Mr. Edw. Wilson, 

 who obtained it in Paris. The Academy possesses three specimens of the 

 smaller species now described, two of which were presented by Robt. McDowell 

 M. D., Surgeon at Sierra Leone, and the other was presented, with other inte- 

 resting birds, by Rev. Wesley Johnson, a pious and learned gentleman attached 

 to an American Mission at Monrovia, Western Africa. 



PiTYLUS flavo cinereits, nobis. 



Loxia canadensis, Linn, variety A. Lath. Gen. Hist. V, p. 2S2. 



Space about the base of the bill extending to the eyes, and including the chin, 

 black. 



Front and top of the head, sides of the neck, breast, and under surface of the 

 wings at the shoulders, bright yellow, running into green on the neck and back. 



Upper part of the back, wings and tail yellowish green. 



Scapular region, lower part of the back, rump, upper tail coverts, abdomen 

 and under tail coverts light cinerous gray. 



Middle of the belly and under tail coverts nearly white. 



Hab. South America. 



Total length, of skin, from tip of bill to end of tail about 7 inches, wing 4, 

 tail 3 inches. 




G8 [JWNH, 



I have seen one specimen only of tliis species, which hclonged to the Rivoii 

 collection. 



It is nearly related to Loxia canadenaisy Linn., which it strongly resembles in 

 general appearance, but may at once be distinguished by the cinereous lower 

 portion of the whole body above and below, which colour is separated from the 

 yellow of the breast by a well defined line, while in L. canadensix, the entire 

 inferior surface is bright yellow. 



The bill of the species now described is larger than that of either of eight spe- 

 cimens of L. catiadeiisis which I have examined.

 East India Company to this Society. (See list at page 79.) 



The Publication Committee announced the publication of the second 

 Number of the New Series of the Journal of the Academy. 



Dr. Morton offered the following remarks on four skulls of Shosho- 

 nee Indians, deposited by him this evening. 



" They are the first cranial remains of that singular tribe that have 

 ever been brought to this city. They were obtained by our associate. 

 Col. J. C. Fremont,* a gentleman whose extensive explorations have 

 enriched every branch of natural science. The Shoshonees, or Diggers. 

 are proverbially known for their low position in the mental and moral 

 scale of our aboriginal tribes. They wander about in small commu- 

 nities ; have no villages ; build no cabins ; plant no corn, nor cultivate 

 any vegetable. They protect themselves from the weather, under the 

 edges of rocks, and go scantily clothed in the skins of wild animals. 



" Two out of four of these skulls are so small, so receding in the fore- 

 head, and so depressed over the whole coronal region, that they could 

 not, by intrinsic evidence alone, have been identified with any branch 

 of the aboriginal American race. They want the vertical occiput and 

 general rounded form of the Indian head, and have a narrowness of 

 the face unusual with these people. I submit the following brief 

 memoranda : 



"1. Skull of a woman of thirty-five or forty years of age. The 

 anterior region is contracted in all its diameters; the forehead very 

 low and receding, so as to give a facial angle of but seventy degrees. 

 The posterior region is remarkably full in proportion, and the internal 

 capacity gives seventy-three cubic inches as the bulk of the brain. 



" 2. Another skull of a woman of twenty-five or thirty years, of a 

 conformation like the preceding. The facial angle is larger, but the in- 

 ternal capacity is but seventy-one cubic inches. 



" 3. Skull of a woman of fifty. The developments much like those 

 of the two preceding heads. The forehead is very low ; the face 

 broad, heavy, and protruding ; but the vertex is high, and the occiput 

 combines the vertical form and great lateral diameter with that of the 

 common Indian head. Internal capacity eighty-four cubic inches. 



" These three crania were found nearly together, a few miles from the 

 expansion of Humboldt's river in the Shoshonee country, and Captain 

 Fremont was entirely satisfied that they belonged to people of that 

 nation. 



" Heads of such small capacity and ill-balanced proportions could

 genious draftsman of Col. Fremont's expedition. 




7G [August, 



only have belonged to savages ; and it is iDtercsting to observe such 

 remarkable accordaucc between the cranial devclupments, and mental 

 and moral faculties. Perhaps we could nowhere liud humanity in a 

 more debased form than among these very Shoshonccs, for they possesp 

 the vices, without the rcdoomiiig qualities of tlic t^urroundiug Indian 

 tribes ; and even their cruelty is not combined with courage A well 

 formed head is no evidence of superior intellect; but on the other 

 hand, a head that is defective in all its proportions, must bo almost in- 

 evitably associated with low and brutal propensities, and corresponding 

 degradation (tf mind ; and such is prc-cmiaeutly the case with the 

 wretched Shoshonecs. 



"4. Tlio fourth skull of this scries is the very type of Indian confor- 

 mation ; broad and full in the inter-parietal region ; the occiput vertical 

 and the vertex itself remarkably prominent. The face is broad; the 

 nose salient ; the skull thick ; and the whole structure massive to an 

 (•xtreme degree : yet this head, which is that of a man of sixty years, 

 has an internal capacity of ninety-one cubic inches, or ten above the 

 average of his race. The tribe to which he belonged could not be as- 

 certained. The skull was picked up on the western slope of the Cali- 

 fornian mountains, and among the haunts of the Shoshonees ; but it> 

 developments would lead me to refer it to some other and more intel- 

 lectual tribe." 



The following resolutions were offered by Dr. Morton, and unani- 

 mously adopted : — 



Beso/ned, That the cordial thanks of this Society be tendered to the 

 Hon. Court of Directors of the East India Company, for their very 

 liberal and most interesting donation of a series of casts of the Sivalik 

 fossils, which have been safely received, and are now in progress of 

 arrangement in the collections of the Academy. 



Resolved, That the grateful thanks of this Society be presented to 

 their associate, Dr. Thomas Horsfield, for his present of the cast of the 

 cranium of Sivatherium giganteum, (which has been received in perfect 

 condition, and will form a most valuable addition to the Academy's 

 series of Sivalik fossils,) and also for the accompanying copies of the 

 Plantse Javanicse rariores, and Annulosa Javanica.

Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



The Committee on the following papers by Dr. Gambel, reported in 

 favour of publication : — 



Description of a new Mexican Quail. 



By William Gambel, M. D. 



Oetyx *thoracicus. 



"With a full somewhat pointed crest, the feathers of which are black, obscurely 

 mixed with dull-brown and rufous. Napemottledwithblack and bright rufous, and 

 traversed by two interrupted white lines, which commence of a cinereous colour 

 about the front and pass over the eyes. Throat and cheeks pale cinereous, each 

 feather with a narrow black margin. Sides of neck, breast and sides pale rufous : 

 deepest on sides of neck, where the feathers have a few scattering black spots. 

 Lower part of belly and vent white. Under tail coverts rusty-white, mottled 

 with black. Tail very short and rounded, its colour dark-brown, with freckled 

 irregular bars of rusty-white. Lower part of back and upper tail coverts irre- 

 gularly variegated with different shades of grey, fulvous and black. Upper part 

 of back dark rufous, the centres of the feathers grayish, and traversed by fine 

 irregular, dusky lineations. Wings and scapulars beautifully variegated with 

 black, rufous and grey ; wing coverts and scapulars having the upper vanes deep 

 black, margiued and lined with rufous, the lower vanes greyish freckled, and 

 blotched with black, while the shafts are dull whitish. 



Tertiaries on their upper vanes with broad fulvous margins. Feet and legs 

 pale, bill black. Irides chocolate-brown. 



Length 8 inches, wing 5 inches, tail 2 inches, tarsus 1 S-lOths, ridge of bill 

 6-lOth, from angle of mouth 7J-10ths. 



This appears to be an undescribed species of that group of quails which so 

 much resemble our common 0. virginianus. The present, however, is readily 

 distinguished from that species by its much longer bill and very short tail, as 

 well as its general markings, particularly beneath ; the breast and sides being 

 of a plain fawn colour, or pale rufous. The only specimen from which I describe 

 was brought from Jalapa, Mexico, by Mr. Pease. It does not appear to be quite 

 adult, and the markings about the head and throat may be somewhat different in 

 the old bird ; still, however, its characters are sufficiently marked. Judging 

 from description, it must very nearly resemble the 0. pectoralis^ of Gould ; but 

 besides the difference of markings, he makes no mention of that species having 

 a crest. The length of the bird, as well as of the wing, is in this also just one 

 inch greater, which would hardly be the case in a young bird. 



Descriptions of two new California Quadrupeds, 

 By Wm. Gambel, M. D. 

 Dipodomys *agilis. 

 Colour above yellowish-brown, mixed with dusky ; beneath pure white, ex- 

 tending half way up the sides. Head elongated, tapering from the ears to a sharp 

 point. Ears nearly round, sparsely hairy. Eyes large, dark brown. A large 




78 [August, 



pouch on each side of the head, openiag externally on the checks. Both hind 



and fore feet with four toes and the rudiment of a fifth. The hind legs Terj 



long and strong. Tail verj long, slender covered with hair, and ending in a 



pencillated tuft. 



Length lOj inches, including the tail, which is G\ inches.

 ^^•°""{ 8 molars. 



In the upper jaw the incisors are divided by a longitudinal furrow. 



This beautiful Jcrboa-liko animal is an abundant inhabitant of the vineyardf 

 and cultivated fields of the Pueblo de los Angeles, Upper California. 



Like the other pouched animals, it forms extensive burrows, traversing the 

 fields in different directions, and are only dislodged during the process of irriga- 

 tion. They leap with surprising agility, sometimes the distance of ten feet or 

 more at a spring, and are difficult to capture. 



Mus * Calif amicus. 



Dark grey ; lighter about the head and shoulders ; above tipped with light 

 brown ; on the sides almost fulvous. Beneath almost white. Fore feet with 

 four toes and the rudiment of a fifth. Hind feet with five toes. Tail nearly 

 five inches in length, pretty thickly covered with short rigid hairs. Head acutely 

 conical ; ears large, rounded, thin, sparsely hairy ; one inch in length, and 5-8ib6 

 in breadth. Length of the body 4^ inches. Old male, — bristles, of the nose 21 

 inches. 



I captured but a single specimen of this species in a field near Monterey, 

 Tipper California, which, with those of the former, I had the misfortune to lose. 



The Committee to whom was referred the duty of preparing a cor- 

 rected list of Members and Correspondents, presented a report, which 

 was adopted, and two hundred and fifty copies of the list ordered in 

 4to. form. The following committee was appointed to superintend tb^ 

 publication of the same : Drs. Zantzinger, Griffith, and Bridges.

Tanagra nigro-aurila, nobis. 



Superior and point of the inferior mandible, black, — other portions of the infe-

Head above, chin and throat, ending in a point on the breast, crimson. 



A broad stripe from the base of the bill, including the eye and ear, glossj 

 black. This stripe completely separates the crimson of the upper part of the 

 head from that of the throat. 



Entire upper surface of the body, except the head, black, which is also the co- 

 lor of the wings and tail. Under parts of the body from the breast, white. 



Legs, in the dried skin, nearly black. 



Total length of skin, from tip of bill to end of tail, about 6J inches ; wing 

 3 1-lOth ; tail 2 8-lOth inches. 



Hah. Rio Negro, South America. 



This species very much resembles both Tanagra gtdarit, Linn., and capitaia, 




80 [October, 



D'Orbigny, from cither of which it may be distinguished by its black uares and 

 ears, and also by the absence of purjile on the breast. In the species now de- 

 scribed, of which I have seen six specimens, the tiiroat and breast are of the 

 same color, exactly as the upper part of the head, without the slii,'htest appear- 

 ance of the purple into which tiie crimson changes in both the species men- 

 tioned. The legs, also, in the present species, are nearly or quite black, in 

 which respect they dilfer from those of T. capKata, which are yellow. 



A specimen of this remarkable species was obtained in Europe by Mr. Edward 

 Wilson, to whose valuable additions to the collectionof the Academy I have fre- 

 quently alluded. I have also seen other specimens, two of which I procured from 

 a collection, brought from the Rio Negro by Mr. John Wulf, an intelligent mer- 

 chant, formerly resident at Para. 



The Committee on the following communication by Dr. Hallowell, 

 reported in favor of publication : — 



Notes of the post-mortem appearances observed in a Cynocephalus porcarius, whk/i 



difd in the Menagerie at Philaddphia. 



By Edward Hallowell, M. D. 



The right lung is greatly enlarged and tuberculous ; the tuberculous matter 

 exists in the form of infiltration, and is disseminated in masses leaving inter- 

 vening spaces of hepatized lung of a brick- red color, firm and resisting to the 

 touch ; the greater portion of the lower lobe of this lung, as well as a very con- 

 siderable part of the upper, is occupied with this matter ; the opposite 

 lung is comparatively healthy, a few tuberculous deposits being observed at its 

 root and apex, and also in the lower lobe, which is somewhat congested. Several 

 of the bronchial glands are enlarged, one of them measuring fourteen lines in 

 length. Pericardium pale, containing no serosity ; coronary veins much enlarged. 

 Abdomen. Mucous membrane of ojsopbagus pale, apparently healthy; the livr is 

 of a dark-chocolate color, and has four lobes ; the second of these counting from 

 the right is the largest ; the liver measures five and a half inches transversely, 

 three inches antero-posteriorly, and one and a quarter in depth ; no tuber- 

 cles are observed in it ; the gall-bladder, which lies in a sulcus upon the under 

 surface of the largest lobe is moderately distended with bile, tinging its parietes 

 a light-green color ; the spleen measures three and three quarter inches in length 

 by one and a half in breadth in its broadest part ; it is elongated at its right ex- 

 tremity, tapering almost to a point ; the opposite extremity is rounded, the entire 

 oro-an presenting a somewhat triangular form ; no tubercles are observed in any 

 part of it; its tissue is of a deep-purple color, almost black from congestion : 

 the stomach measures six inches transversely, by three and a half from the 

 entrance of the oesophagus to its greater curvature; its muscular fibres are very 

 apparent; the oesophagus enters it about the middle of the lesser curvature ; the 

 mucous membrane of the stomach is of a brownish-red color near the pylorus, 

 elsewhere of a pale onion tint ; no crypts are observable ; the j^ancr ears measures 

 three inches transversley, one and a quarter in its greatest breadth near its head ; 

 the large intestine, including the ccecum, measures two feet nine and a half 




1848.] 87 



inches (Fr.) ia length; the coecum measures two inches five lines in length: the 

 mucous membrane of the large intestine is of a greenish olive tint throughout ; 

 the isolated crypts are very distinct ; the small intestine measures six feet two 

 inches ; the mucous membrane is apparently healthy, of a pale onion tint slightly 

 reddened in portions ; the isolated glands are very numerous near the upper ex- 

 tremity of the duodenum ; there are no valvulae conniventes ; eight plaques of 

 Peyer are counted in the ileum ; the largest is about one and a half inches in 

 length ; the mesenteric glands are healthy; the kidneys are of a brick-red color ; 

 tissue healthy; bladder not examined. 



The Committee to wliom was referred the following catalogue of 

 Mexican Birds, reported in favor of publication. 



Catalogue of Birds collected by Jlr. Wm. S. Pease, during the march of the Army 



of the United States from Vera Cruz to the City of Mexico. 



By John Cassin. 



Upon publicity being given to the fact that the Department of War of the 

 United States of America intended sending an expedition, to consist of both Naval 

 and Military forces, against the city of Vera Cruz, Mr. Wm. S. Pease, Member 

 of the Lyceum of Natural History of New York, and Correspondent of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, proposed to embrace an opportunity 

 which would thus probably offer, of his accompanying the military force into 

 Mexico. 



Having succeeded in effecting a suitable arrangement, Mr. Pease joined the 

 army under General Scott, at Vera Cruz, and continued with it until the final 

 evacuation of the country. 



The facilities for ccllecting and for observation possessed by Mr. Pease were 

 necessarily of a restricted character, resulting from the position of the army 

 in a hostile country, and particularly so during the marches, when it 

 was constantly attended by bands of armed inhabitants, or guerillas, 

 who hovered in its vicinity for the purpose of committing depredations 

 upon persons who ventured away from the main body. Notwithstanding all 

 disadvantages, however, Mr. Pease made very interesting collections of birds, 

 insects and other productions of the country. 



Mr. Pease represents himself as particularly indebted to Col. G. W. Hughes of 

 the 1st Regiment Maryland infantry, and to Otis Hoyt, M. D., Surgeon of the Mas- 

 sachusetts volunteers, and medical director of thegeneral hospital at Jalapa, whose 

 kindness and encouraging treatment of Mr. Pease, are honorable to those gentle- 

 men as friends of science, and worthy of the character of American officers.

S8 [OCTOB?!K. 



Adult 9?.— Entire upper surface of the body, bead, winga and tail, hair 

 brown, a shade darker on the bead. Feathers on the cheek and jaw, brown, 

 which color forms a partial collar on the front of the neck. 



Throat, fore neck, abdomen and under tail coverts, white, with a few brown 

 ."pots or bars on the latter. 



Neck encircled by a narrow l)and of white, all the feathers of which are tipped 

 or edged with brown. 



Breast, flanks and thighs, white, every feather having about three bands of the 

 same brown as the back. 



Fldge of the wing at the flexure and inner wing coverts, white; many of the 

 feathers with luuated spots of brown. All the quill feathers with broad wbit« 

 bars on their inner webs ; fifth primary longest. 



Upper tail coverts spotted with white. Tail with four or five narrow white 

 bars, and tipped with white. 



Total length of skin, from tip of bill to end of tail, about 15 inches, wing 7, 

 tail Cj inches. 



Young $ ? — Under parts tinged with fulvous or buff. Breast, flanks and 

 thighs with the bands much narrower, and the throat with a more decided 

 brown collar. 



Feathers of the back and wing coverts, with ferruginous and white spotF. 

 Upper tail coverts with the white markings more numerous. 



Superciliary feathers white, tipped with brown. 



Total length of skin, from tip of bill to end of tail, about 14 inches, wing 6J. 

 tail 6 inches. 



Hab. Near Jalapa, Mexico. 



This species considerably resembles some stages of plumage of the 31. xantho- 

 Ihorax (Cuv.) and the M. leucauchen, (Temm.) PI. col. 92, 306, (which are pro- 

 bably identical.) It may readily be distinguished from either of those by the 

 entire absence of the rufous chesnut color of the breast and back, and by the 

 much broader, and lesser number of the bands upon the under surface of the 

 body. 



In the species now described, the character of the white markings of the tail is 

 also different from that of M. xanlholhorax or of leucauchen^ and more approaches 

 that of the larger species, J/, brachyierus, (Cuv.) These markings arc broad and 

 truncated at the shaft of the feather, instead of ending acutely and forming tri- 

 angles, as in those species. 



Two specimens ( 5 and $ . ?) were brought by Mr. Pease ; a third speci- 

 men of the same species, in more adult plumage, was previously received from 

 Paris, in the collection made by Mr. Edward Wilson. 



6. Accipiter fusciis, (Gm.) Falco velox, Wilson, Am. Orn. 45, 46. 



Near Jahipa all the year. The two specimens (nearly adult and young 9) 

 brought by Mr. Pease, are perfectly similar to others obtained in the vicinity 

 of this city. In both specimens the tail is quite even, in which respect they 

 differ from Mr. Swainson'a description of A. Mexkanus. 



7. Accipiter Cooperi, (Bonap.) Aud. Birds Am. pi. 3G, 141. 

 A young male from near Jalapa. 



Dr. Kaup, in the Isis, 1847, page 178, and Mr. Gray, in List of specimens of 

 Birds in the British Museum, give Accipiter Coopcri (Bonap.) as a synonyme for 




1818.] 89 



Accipiter pileatus (De Wied) PL col. 205. This is not correct, as may readily 

 be ascertained by reference to numerous specimens of both those species in 

 the collection of this Academy. 



In fact but a small degree of resemblance exists between any age or sex ot 

 the two species, so far as I have seen. The A. Cooperi, is much the larger, nor 

 have I ever seen a specimen of this species assuming plumage at all approaching 

 that represented in PI. col. 205. 



8. Circus cymieus, (Linn.) 

 Young birds from near Jalapa. 



9. Ephialtes atricapilla, (Natt.) PI. col. 145. 



10. Syrnium ? 



A species to which I am not at present prepared to attach a specific name. 

 I have reason to suppose that it is one of the species which Mr. Gray has named 

 in his List of the Rapacious birds in the British Museum, of which no description 

 has come under my notice, if published. 



11. Nyctidromus Derbyanus, Gould. Icon. Av. ii. pi. 2. 



A young bird from the neighbourhood of Jalapa, where it lives all the year. 



12. Momoius brasiliensis, (Laih.) 



Near Jalapa, found in thickets, iris red. 



In the specimen brought by Mr. Pease, and also in two others from Mexico 

 in the Rivoli collection, the crown of the head is much lighter coloured than 

 is usual in South American specimens. 



13. Trogon mezicanus, Swainson, Gould. Mon. PI. 2. 



14. Trogon exalapensis, Du Bus, Esquisses Orn. I. pi. 2. 

 Two males from the neighbourhood of Jalapa. 



15. Trogon ambiguus ? Gould. Mon. pi. 4. 



A young bird, sufficiently ambiguous at least to be referred to this species. Of 

 these three species, Mr. Pease has the following note : " Live on the tierra templada 

 the greater part of the year, in the thickets bordering small streams, very shy, 

 but when alarmed flying only a short distance and endeavoring to conceal 

 themselves. The plumage appears to be very slightly attached to the skin, and if 

 you are so unfortunate as to wound a specimen, it is almost entirely lost in the 

 struggles of the bird." 



16. Alcedo americana, Gm. pi. Enl. 591. 

 Neighbourhood of Jalapa, all the year. 



17. Alcedo vestila, Lesson. Traite, i. p. 242. 



I give this name on the faith of labels attached to specimens in the Rivoli 

 collection, M. Lesson's description being too short to enable me to identify the 

 species satisfactorily. 



18. Cyanocorax ornaius, (Lesson.) Rev. Zool. 1839, p. 41.

19. Cyanocorax peruvianus, (Gm.) Le Vaill. Ois. de Par. 46. 



The specimen brought by Mr. Pease, agrees exactly with the description of 

 ,Garrulus luxuosis, Lesson, Rev, Zool. 1839, p. 100, which is also Mexican. 

 I can find no difl"ereQce, however, between the present specimen and the young 

 C. peruvianus, from South America. 



Mr. Pease notes : " This species lives on the sides of the volcanoes all the 




90 [October, 



year, Mexican name, pepe verde. Very similar in its habits to the other species 

 brought by me, all of which are very numerous on the (terra (ei/iplada, and the 

 hilla bounding the phiins ofPerotc and I'uebla on the east." 



20. Ci/anocorax concolor, Cassin. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., Philada., Feb. 1848. 

 The second specimen of this species which has fallen under my notice. It 



differs in no respect from my description, except, perhaps, that the feathers of the 

 head are slightly elongated or subcrested. 



Of this species Mr. Pease remarks: "Common on the hills bordering the 

 plains of Puebla, about Pinal and the mountains skirting the valley of Mexico 

 on the cast; remains all the year; difference of the sexes in size alone. Iris 

 light brown." 



21. Sturnclht hypocrcpis, Wagler. Isis, 1832, p. 281. 



A species much resembling the common S. ludoviciana, but differing in several 

 important characters. It may easily be distinguished by its shorter and more 

 pointed bill, and smaller size. 



This species is well described in De Sagra's Cuba, under the name of S. ludo- 

 viciana.

Observations on the Geology and Natural History of Mexico. 

 By Wm. H. Pease. 

 Having noticed among the published correspondence from the army in Mexico, 

 but little information respecting the natural features of that country, I take the 

 liberty of presenting to the Academy the result of a few hasty observations 

 made on a part of the route from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico. But few op- 

 portunities for scientific investigations were afforded to those connected with the 

 army, on account of the active operations they were incessantly engaged in, from 

 the time of leaving the coast until the return of the army. I was enabled, how- 




92 [OCTOBKB, 



ever, principally in companywitbscouting parties, to visit that part of the country 

 between the niiige of volcanoes, bounding tbc plains of I'erolc and I'ucbla on tbe 

 east, and tlie Guliili of Mexico, comprising the greater jmrl of tbe tJtale of Vera 

 Cruz, and to make some collections in Natural History. 



Tbe general outlines of the country I presume it is unnecessary for me to 

 detail. Tbe plains of Cuetlacblan, or tbe iierra calienle, a.a they are more usually 

 called, comprise that region of countcy bordering tbe Gulpb of Mexico. They 

 are about twenty-five miles in width, extending back to tbe Plan del Rio by a 

 gradual ascent of thirty feet per mile, willi but U-.w elevations or dcpresbions, 

 except at tbe river Antigua, and other small streams which pass through them in 

 a north easterly direction. Beyond tbe Plan del Rio tbe ascent increases over a 

 regular succession of bills and plains, until j'ou reach the foot of the range of 

 mountains in which tbe peaks of Orizaba, Pcrotc and others are situated. This 

 range forms the rim or eastern boundary of tbe plains of Anahuac, which are 

 more commonly known as the tierra iemplada, and are about thirty-five miles in 

 width. The sides and top of this mountain range are called tbe Urra fria, 

 immediately beyond which lie the great table lands of Mexico. 



The table lands extend, with little or no variation in their general level, to the 

 Cordilleras bordering the Pacific Ocean, though they are divided into several 

 plains by ranges of volcanoes and porpbyrific rocks. 



The tierra caliente is bordered on tbe Gulpb of Mexico by low Band billB, 

 from four to six miles in width, not bare as has been represented, but covered 

 with a thick chapparcl, or thicket of Cacti and thorn bushes, to within reach of 

 the water. Great numbers of fresh water and land shells are found on these hills 

 and on the beach, thrown up from the Gulpb, which may be referred to a living 

 species. 



After passing these hills a few miles, I noticed at one locality a layer of lime- 

 stone. It is covered by a coarse conglomerate of volcanic and porpbyritic rocke, 

 which extends over the whole upper part of the tierra caliente, rendering the 

 surface rough and stony. At the Puenta Nacional it is exposed to the depth of 

 two hundred feet, interstratified irregularly with veins of fine sandstone. Deep 

 gullies are worn through it to the rivers, by the drainage of the plains during the 

 wet season. The rivers are the only source of irrigation, receiving no supplies 

 in their course from the mountains to tbe coast. 



The greater part of the plains is covered with a dense growth of vegetation, 

 so thick that it would seem almost impossible for tbe soil to support more, and 

 the trees and bushes are loaded with an innumerable variety of parasitical plants 

 and vines, interlacing and binding them together, in such a manner as to render 

 them absolutely impenetrable. On other parts, particularly between tbe con- 

 glomerate and the coast, tbe chapparel is more open, dotted with clumps of low 

 dwarfish trees and Cacti, and affords grazing to herds of half wild cattle,in which 

 the property of the inhabitants principally consists. To tbe south of Vera Cruz 

 the cultivation of cotton has been introduced ; it is of white fine quality, but 

 perhaps for want of proper cultivation the staple is very short, so that when 

 worked it requires to be mixed with other varieties. 



The inhabitants live mostly on the small bottom lands of the rivers, their 

 crops consisting of corn, chili and frijoles. They are a puny and sickly' peo- 

 ple, being subject to intermittent and typhoid fevers, during the months after 

 the close of the wet season. Though the temperature at the Puenta Nacional, 




1848.] 



93 



;n the months of September, October and November, averaged 80® at 3 P. M. 

 with little variation, the atmosphere was so loaded with moisture that it was im- 

 possible to keep our fighting tools free from rust for twenty-four hours at a time, 

 protect them as we might. 



The animals met with at the Puenta Nacional and on the tierra caliente, are 

 for the greater part common to Texas and the north ; the common deer is 

 abundant, though of small size ; the red fox, the prairie wolf, and the spotted 

 tiger cat are frequently met with, and the Puma also, though more frequently in 

 the mountains above. Reptiles are exceedingly numerous, though of few species. 

 The royal Iguano, as it is called, is found in the cliffs bordering the river Antigua, 

 and grows to a very large size ; one killed by a Mexican measuring nine feet 

 in length. The flesh of this species, as well as that of others, is considered quite 

 a delicacy by the inhabitants. I observed a curious habit of a species of lizard, 

 which has not been noticed before to my knowledge ; it is that of passing over 

 the water in an erect position, resting on its hinder parts, and propelling itsell 

 by its hind feet, its tail lying horizontally on the water, acting as a rudder. In 

 the San Juan and Antigua rivers I noticed an alligator which appeared to be dif- 

 ferent from our common species ; the young, a specimen of which I caught, is 

 entirely black, without the usual yellow markings on its back. 



Land and fresh water shells are scarce ; the beds of the streams being very 

 stony ; nearer the coast, however, they may perhaps be more abundant. After 

 passing the tierra caliente, the ascent increases over the tierra templada, as above 

 stated, to the foot of the mountains. The whole of the surface of this part of the 

 country is much broken by low ranges of volcanic hills and deep ravines or 

 barrancas, as they aie called, of two to five hundred feet in depth, which run, 

 commonly, at right angles from the mountain chain above. The city of Jalapa 

 derives its name from that of an ancient Indian village a few leagues distant, and 

 signifies " built among barrancas." 



Most of the hills are of volcanic formation, though they are not all so, as I have 

 seen stated. The limestone shows itself in the valleys at the foot of the moun- 

 tains, and in the barrancas, when of sufficient width. It is, of course, very much 

 altered from its conned ion with the volcanic rock, being uncrystallized and 

 whitened. It is not fossiliferous, and, as far as I noticed, unstratified. At Quar- 

 terpec, a few leagues south of Jalapa, and at other places, it is burnt by the In- 

 dians, and the lime is sold in the neighbouring towns and cities. 



The soil of the valleys is rich, and under cultivation produces during the whole 

 year, rice, coffee, tobacco, sugar cane, corn and other vegetable productions, 

 fruit, &c., of both tropical and temperate climes, in great abundance. The ave- 

 rage of temperature I should place lower than Humboldt. During the months 

 of January and February, there were several nights of severe frosts in the 

 neighborhood of Jalapa and below, which stripped the trees on the hills of their 

 foliage, but I was told it was of very unusual occurrence. 



Every one who has visited this country must agree with Humboldt, that the 

 region comprising the tierra templada and the eastern slope of the mountains 

 above, is "one of the most beauti.'ul and picturesque in the world." No other 

 part of the world, perhaps, can present scenery of such sublime and picturesque 

 beauty. When travelling over the rough and barren hills, strewn with volcanic 

 rocks, the scene is suddenly changed by coming upon the edge of a barranca or 

 ravine, its bottom lands several hundred feet below you, highly cultivated in 




•^* [October, 



fiL-Us of sugar cane, corn, &c., dotted with the Btraw-thatchcd cottages of the 

 Indians, and presenting a most perfect panorama or picture of nature's own paint- 

 ing, enclosed, as it were, in a frame of black and jagged rocks, which form its 

 perpendicular sides, without a vestige of vegetation growing upon them. Far 

 off below, lays stretched out the tierra caliente, having the appearance of an 

 immense park, bounded on the horizon by the Gulf; and yet, elevated as your 

 position seems to be. on turning to look in the opposite direction, Orizaba,, with 

 its silvery cap of eternal snow, and the base and rocky peak of I'erote, still 

 stand above you eight or nine thousand feet. 



In addition to the animals on the tierra caliente, I noticed the raccoon, the 

 opossum, the bassaris astuta, or ring-tailed weasel, as it is called by the Mexi- 

 cans, and several species of deer. I noticed also a porcupine, which struck me 

 as different from the common species. The puma and jaguar arc also met with 

 in the mountains. 



The mammalia of this part of Mexico seem to be identical with, or nearly allied 

 to, more northern species, while the birds for the greater part are found also much 

 farther south. Lizards are less numerous, but snakes more so thanon the tierra 

 caliente. The plant? I should think more characteristic than either mammalia 

 or birds, and present a rich field for investigation. 



The two species of Jalapa root are collected in small quantities, only on the 

 sides of the mountains by the Indians, the greater part exported being brought 

 from the north and west of the city of Mexico, 



In the neighbourhood of Jalapa, and on the road passing over the mountains, 

 I noticed several beds and hills of sand, in some of which are deposits of the 

 sulphate of lime, finely crystallized in the form of sand. I was told by the 

 Mexicans that they had dug up here young clams, perhaps cyclas. I mention 

 this fact in confirmation of my opinion that the plains of Anahuac above, or of 

 Perote and Puebia, as they may be called, have been drained by one of the many 

 revolutions (geological, not political,) which this country has passed through. 



The eastern part of the plains above, for the distance of twelve or fifteen miles, 

 is sandy ; beyond are salt beds and soda. In many localities, at the depth often 

 or twelve feet, I saw fossil fresh water shells of the genera Planorbis, Lymnea, 

 Physa, and others, which it is reasonable to suppose once lived at the bottom 

 of lakes which covered these plains, as well as that of the valley of Mexico. 



The volcanic mountains which form the boundaries to the plains, are flanked 

 by ranges of limestone hills, similar in character to those below on the tierra 

 templada. Undoubtedly the range which bounds the plains of Anahuac to the 

 east, is very rich in mineral treasure, as specimens of silver ore are frequently 

 brought in by the Indians, but they, like those of Peru, conceal their knowledge 

 of the localities with the utmost care. About three leagues from Perote I saw a 

 vein of sulphuret of silver three feet in width, associated with blende and sulphate 

 of copper.

Catalogue of the Tertiary Testacea of the United States. 

 By Henry C. Lea. 



The following list is intended as a mere mechanical assistance to the student of 

 our Tertiary Testacea. The descriptions of these species are scattered through 

 the Transactions of learned Societies, Scientific Journals, Pamphlets, and other 

 publications difficult of access, presenting a serious obstacle to any one endea- 

 voring to identify specimens. Labouring under this difiiculty myself, I pre- 

 pared this catalogue, and from my experience of its convenience, I presume that 

 it may be found of assistance to others. I have endeavoured to introduce the 

 recent shells which have been observed in a fossil state, as far as I have seen 

 them noted, but as no regular record has been kept of them, I fear that in that 

 particular, especially, this list may be found imperfect. I have not attempted to 

 determine the conflicting synonymes, either generic or specific, but have merely 

 given the names with a reference to the publications in which they are alluded 

 to or described.

Dr. Ijcidy offered the following observations on the development of 

 bone, the structure of articular cartilage, and on the relation of the 

 areolar tissue with muscle and tendon. 



1. On the. development of the Parkinjean corpuscle in bone. — Schwann, in his 

 " Mikroskopisclie Unlcrsuthungen," considers that the Purkinjean corpuscle of 

 bone is derived from the pre-existing cartilage cell, and that the canaliculi are 

 yrolongatioas, or protrusions of the cell wall. Many later authors, among whom 

 are Gerbcr, aui^Todd and Bowman, express the opinion that it originates in the 

 nucleus of the temporary cartilage cell, and Tomes entertains the idea, that after 

 the formation of the osseoua tabes, in the process of osaificatioa, the latter are 



I 




1848.] 117 



filled up by a deposite of osseous granules, and while llu3 deposite is going on, 

 small cells are left, which are the rudimentary Purkinjean corpuscles. Henle 

 thinks them to be the cavities of cells, the thickened walls of which are pierced 

 by the canaliculi. Hassall confirms the view of Schwann, by stating " the 

 bone cells (Purkinjean corpuscles) are to be regarded as complete corpascles, 

 the canaliculi of which are formed by the extension of the cell wall, which is 

 proved by watching the formation and development of bone." 



The opinion of Schwann and Hassall I can fully corroborate from my own 

 observations upon an ossifying frontal bone, from a human embryo measuring 

 two inches from heel to vertex. Each lateral half of the bone is about 3i lines 

 in diameter, and presents to the naked eye the appearance of a delicate and close 

 net-work, arising from the numerous areolce occupied by temporary cartilage. 

 The frontal and orbital plates, it is worthy of insidental remark, at this period, 

 are nearly on a plane with each other, or are connected together at a very obtuse 

 angle along a central, transverse, crescentic, raised line, the rudimentary 

 supra-orbiiar ridge. 



The mode of development of the Purkinjean corpuscle, as noticed upon the 

 upper or posterior border of the os frontis, is briefly as follows: After the 

 primitive ossific rete has been firmed from the deposite of the osseous salts, 

 enclosing groups of cartilage cells in the areolae, the further deposite takes place 

 in a fibrous or line-like course from the parietes of the areolae of the primitive 

 osseous rete, in the interspaces of the cartilage cells nearest to, or in contact 

 with the sides of the areolae. At this period the cella'shoot out or extend their 

 canaliculi between the fibrillae just formed, and then the cell-wall and continuous 

 walls of the canaliculi fuse with the translucent, homogeneous, or hyaline sub- 

 stance of the cartilage existing between the cells and the osseous fibrillas, and 

 with the fibrillae themselves, by the deposite of the osseous salts. The period 

 of the formation of the canaliculi appears to be quite definite, occurring during 

 the deposite of the osseous salts, aud not before. To such an extent is this the 

 case, that I noticed in several instances cells which had formed their canaliculi 

 upon the side which was ossified, while upon the other side I could not distin- 

 guish any trace of them. 



During the whole time of the formation of the Purkinjean corpuscle, the 

 nucleus remains unchanged ; at least no change is perceptible in it beneath the 

 microscope, and by applying tincture of iodine to the preparation, which turns 

 the nucleus brown, I was able to detect it within the perfected Purkinjean cor- 

 puscle, not only corresponding to the nucleus of the remaining unossificd cartilage 

 cells in granular structure, but also in its measurements. After the Purkinjeaa 

 corpuscle has been formed a short time, the nucleus dissolves away or disappears. 



The newly formed Purkinjean corpuscle is about the same size as the remain- 

 ing unossified cartilage cells, as indicated in the list of measurements appended 

 to these notes.

2. On the intimate strucLure of articular cartilage. — As is familiar to every 

 anatomist, articular cartilages always fracture in a direction perpendicular to 




118 [December, 



tbcir surface, the broken edge presenting n. striated appearance in tlie same direc- 

 tion. Tliis character the older anatoniistd ascribed to a fibrous or columnar 

 structure of the cartilapc, likellmt of the enamel of the tctlli, whili- liistologisU 

 at the present day consider it as dependent upon the vertical arrangement of the 

 rows of cartilage cells, although it has been suspected to depend upon some 

 ultimate arrangement of the matrix or intercellular substance not yet detected. 

 In some lute observations upon the structure and development of articular carti- 

 lagc. tlirough means of an excellent microscojie, made for me by Messrs. Powell 

 & Lealand, of London, I have been enabled to discover a definite structure in 

 the intercellular substance. This consists of an arrangement of exceedingly 

 fine, transparent filaments, nearly uniform in thickness, and having an avcrnge 

 measurement of the ' of an inch. An easy method of detecting thid fila- 



2MKX> 



mentous structure, is to tear a fine fibre from the broken edge of an articular 

 cartilage which has been macerated in diluted muriatic acid, by means of a 

 fine-pointed forceps, and exposing it in the ordinary way in water beneath 

 the microscope, using the quarter or eighth inch objective power. The 

 fine filaments, partly detached, will be seen in great numbers along the 

 Bides of the fibre. When these filaments are viewed by very oblique light_ 

 they appear to h.ave an indistinct granular appearance, each composed of a single 

 row of granules, which of course, in the articular cartilage, adhere together with 

 greater tenacity in the direction of the length of tiie filaments than laterally. 



When an articular cartilage is broken in a direction from the under to the free 

 surface, it is found that the fragments adhere by a membranous layer, cover- 

 ing the free surface of the cartilage, which, by the older anatomists, was 

 considered as the extension of the synovial membrane; by the anatomists of 

 our day, either as a homogeneous layer, or as nothing more than a stratum of the 

 cartilage, the rows of cells of which take a direction parallel with the surface, 

 or at right angles to those more deeply situated, and thus giving rise to this dis- 

 tinct laminated condition. That it is a cartilaginous layer is undoubtedly correct, 

 but instead of the rows of cells determining the arrangement, I find it depends 

 upon the filamentary structure of the matrix, the filaments taking a course 

 parallel with the surface of the cartilage, in a direction at right angles to those 

 forming the matrix of the deeper part of the cartilage. 



A straight fibre may be torn from the articular cartilage, and in the act 

 tearing, should a row of cells be in the line of rupture, as is frequently the case, 

 (for although generally following the course of the filaments, yet a number are 

 oblique or even somewhat irregular,) it will be torn through, which in itsel. 

 would be sufficient to indicate that the fibrous arrangement of the cartilage did 

 not depend upon its rows of cells, and indeed they have but little or no influence 

 in this respect. 



From the foregoing description of the structure of the intercellular sub- 

 stance of articular cartilage, it can be readily understood that it may deter- 

 mine the course of the rows of cells, which is really the case. In the earliest 

 period of the existence of the articular cartilage, the cartilage cells are 

 sino-le, isolated, and equally dififused throughout a mass of hyaline substance, 

 which latter in the progress of development becomes indistinctly granular, 

 and then for the first time have I observed the appearance of the filamentary 

 structure. In the splitting up of the primary cartilage cell and deve- 

 lopment of others, they arrange themselves in the direction in which there is 

 least resistance, which would be of course in the direction of the filaments of the 



i 




1848.] 119 



intercellular matrix. Hence, in the deeper part of the articular cartilage, the 

 rows of cells are generally vertical to the surface, and parallel to the same in its 

 more superficial portion. 



In some of the articular cartilages sometimes there are peculiarities of struc- 

 ture which I think have never been pointed out, and are worthy of notice. 



In the articular cartilage of the condyles of the os femoris, I have occa- 

 Bionally noticed numerous minute lacunae? found in greatest abundance near 

 the surface of attachment, and gradually decreasing in number until they entirely 

 disappear in the superficial third of the cartilage. They are elongated, compressed, 

 and their long diameter is invariably situated transversely, at right angles to the 

 filamentous matrix, or parallel with t*be surface of the cartilage. The longest mea- 

 sure transversely _L of an inch, the shortest _L, of an inch, in the vertical 



1200 3123 



direction _L of an inch. When well defined, they appear more transparent 

 than the cartilaginous matrix in which they are situated ; when viewed a little 

 within the focus they appear deep black. 



Fibres of bone are not unfrequently met with in the articular cartilages, 

 especially in that of the head of the os femoris. They are generally found near 

 the surface of attachment, but are not the continuation of the bony structure 

 upon which the cartilage is placed, for they are always arranged in a direction 

 parallel to the surface. They are compressed cylindrical in form, and in trans- 

 verse section present an elliptical figure, the long diameter of which is placed at 

 right angles to the filaments of the cartilage matrix. They present a concen- 

 trically laminated and a radiated structure, resembling somewhat that of the 

 Haversian ossicle, but they neither present the canal nor the Purkinjean cor- 

 puscles. 



The foregoing observations on articular cartilage will be more detailed and 

 illustrated by figures hei-eafter, in one of our medical journals. 



3. On the arrangement of the areolar sheath of viuscular fasciculi and its rela- 

 tion to the tendon. — Well known is it that the fasciculi of fibres of the muscles 

 are surrounded by sheaths of areolar tissue, but the arrangement of the filaments 

 of fibrous tissue forming the sheaths, and their relation with the tendon, I think 

 has not been properlj^ pointed out. From repeated observations, I have found that 

 the filaments of fibrous tissue cross each other diagonally around the muscular 

 fasciculi, forming a doubly spiral extensible sheath. \one of the filaments run 

 in the direction of the length of the fasciculi, and but few are transverse. Many 

 of the filaments of a sheath form an interlacement in the same diagonal manner 

 with the filaments of the sheaths of neighbouring fasciculi. This arrangement 

 is readily distinguished, if several fasciculi be drawn slightly from each other 

 upon a plate of glass, and the intervening areolar tissue be viewed beneath the 

 microscope. When the filaments reach the rounded extremities of the fasciculi, 

 they become straight, and in this manner conjoin with the tendinous filaments 

 •riginating at the extremities of the muscular fibres. The importance of this 

 arrangement can be readily understood ; from the diagonally crossing course of 

 the areolar filaments, comparatively inelastic in themselves, the sheath is ren- 

 dered elastic, thus permitting the muscular fibres freely to move without their 

 action being interfered with, while at the point of attachment of the fasciculi, 

 where any elasticity would be worse than useless, from the fact that part of the 




120 [DECEMBKa, 



ranscular action wouhl he lost in the mere extension of an clasticsubstanco, we 

 find the lilunuuis arrange tiienibclves so as to hecoiue jmrt of the incxteii:iible 

 tendon.

By John Cassin. 



Ephialtes saffittatus, nobis. Adult ? Entire plumage above rufous brown, 

 inclining to chestnut ; plumage of the head with small pale spots encircled with 

 black, bordering the shafts of the feathers, and near the tips assuming a hastate 

 or sagittate form. 



Plumage of the back with every feather having about three to five spots of the 

 same description, the arrow-headed shape and black border distinct and well 

 defined, some of the spots nearly white; every feather also with very fine trans- 

 verse lines, and minutely dotted or freckled with black. 




122 [December, 



Wing coverts with pale, nearly wliite,sa!;fittate spots encircled with black. In- 

 ternal coverts of the winjfs pale fawn yellow, more or lens spotted with black, 

 and with their tips broadly terminated with black, which forms a conspicuoua 

 bar on the inferior surface of the wing. Outer edge of scupuhirs nearly while 

 with black spots. External webs of primaries with alternate bands of jialc and 

 darker rufous brown ; internal webs much darker, with nearly bhick bands alter- 

 nating with others slightly paler, which (thf jialer) are mottled with black 

 towards the extremities of the quills. E.xpo.sed ends of the secondaries rufous 

 brown, with large pale spots on the shafts, approaching the sagittate form, with 

 their black borders extending into transverse narrow bands. First primary 

 ahortcst, fifth and sixth longest. 



Feathers encircling the eyes, and the long bristle-like feathers at the base of 

 the bill dark chestnut brown, the latter freckled with black ; between the eye 

 and the cavity of the car whitish, with transverse lines, and broadly tipped with 

 deep rufous brown. Feathers of the ruff white at their bases, with narrow trans- 

 verse lines of deep rufous, but presenting a broad subterrainal band of pure 

 white, every feather terminated with a semicircular or lunular band of bright 

 rufous brown. 



Front and superciliary region white, the feathers of the former with their 

 shafts and with some minute marks of very dark brown, superciliary feathers 

 with well defined tips of nearly black. Shorter (or anterior) feathers of the 

 ear-like tufts white, with minute transverse lines and freckles of rufous brown, 

 longer feathers of the tufts brown on their external and white on their internal 

 webs, transversely lined and tipped with darker brown. 



General colour of the under surface of the body very pale rufous and sordid 

 yellowish white, on the breast with every feather having about five to seven 

 very narrow transverse bands more or less distinctly defined, of blackish brown, 

 find minutely and irregularly dotted with the same colour. Abdominal region 

 with the bands less numerous, and many of the feathers having several irregularly 

 shaped, though rather rounded and sagittate spots of nearly black. 



Tarsi covered to the toes with pale rufous whitish feathers. Toes naked. 



Tail same rufous brown as the back, with alternate bands of darker and paler 

 shades, in some instances the paler band on the external opposite to the darker 

 band on the internal web. 



Bill and feet yellow, claws long and slender. 



Total length of skin, about 10 inches, wing 7, tail 4J inches. 



Very young. Upper surface of the head and body pale yellowish and sordid 

 rufous, every feather with several narrow transverse dark lines. Breast and 

 belly darker, with the spots more distinctly rounded and occupying the whole 

 breast and inferior surface. 



Wings and tail more fully developed than the other plumage. 



Hab. India ? 



One specimen of this species, without label, belongs to the Rivoli collection ; 

 another, which is that of a young bird, labelled Malacca, has been received 

 from Mr. Edward Wilson, who obtained it in Paris. I am acquainted with no species 

 of Ephialtes with which this can readily be confounded, and, in fact, it looks 

 more like Dr. Horsfield's plate of Slrix {Phodilus) badius, than any other which 




1848.] 123 



I have met with, and is about the same size, (as the figure,) while in general 

 appearance, particularly in the colouring of the breast and belly, it bears some 

 resemblance to Sirix {Lophoslrix) cristala, Daud., ((/riseata, Lath.) It is, how- 

 ever, a true Ephialtes, though an aberrant species. The sagittate spots dis- 

 tinguish it, and as far as I know are peculiar. 



Ephialtes Watsonii, nobis. Summit of the head black, with a few very 

 minute pale spots, more numerous on the front and eyebrows. Shorter feathers 

 of the ear tufts black, others black also, but with their inner webs spotted or 

 mottled with white. A semicircle above the eye extending to the ear tufts, 

 black; rigid feathers at the base of the bill black, with pale grayish termina- 

 tions ; feathers immediately below the eye gray, mottled and broadly tipped with 

 black. 



Discal feathers grayish white, many of them speckled, and all tipped with 

 black, presenting a white and black semicollar or ruff on each side of the neck. 

 Plumage of the throat with fine alternate bars of black and nearly white. 



Neck above with a well defined collar, the feathers composing which are 

 strongly fulvous, terminated with white and speckled with black. 



Back, rump, tail, and wing coverts mottled and freckled with grayish white 

 upon a black ground, many of the feathers having about three to five very 

 irregular transverse bands of whitish ; on the wing coverts and back some of the 

 pale marks are almost circular with black centres, others are of irregular form 

 also enclosing centres of black. 



External webs of the primaries black, with subquadrate nearly white bars, 

 nearly all of which have black centres, assuming, also, a more or less well de- 

 fined square form. Internal webs of primaries with alternate bands of different 

 shades of black. 



Breast and entire inferior parts pale fulvous, every feather conspicuously 

 marked on the shaft longitudinally with black, and with very irregular transverse 

 bands and irregularly mottled with black ; the black markings most numerous 

 and most irregular on the breast. Many of the feathers on the breast with very 

 pale nearly white spots, having somewhat the appearance of being distributed 

 in pairs. 



Tail black, with about seven or eight narrow irregular grayish bands, many of 

 which have central lines of black. 



Tarsi feathered to the toes, pale fulvous white, mottled with black. 



Bill horn colour at the base, whitish at the tip. 



Total length (of skin) about 9^- inches, wing 7, tail 3J inches. 



Younger ? Plumage above paler, with small spots and minute freckles of 

 grayish white, scarcely assuming the appearance of bands. 



Breast with the dark markings predominating, and tending to form a broad 

 pectoral band; lower parts of the body bright fulvous, with black marks. 



Hab. South America. 



• This species bears some resemblance to Ephialtes atricapilla, (Natt.) Temm. 

 pi. col. 145, but is much larger, and has only one nuchal collar. The general 

 colour above is also much darker ; the fulvous colouring of the inferior surface 

 of the body is also a striking difference. 




124 [December, 



One spcrimcn r.f tliis BpccicH in the Uivoli colU-flion is labelled " Orenoqno," 

 Biul another in tho collection of the Academy is probiihly from South America. 



I have named this bird in lionor of (iavin Watson, M. I)., of this citv, a 

 gentlemen of extensive knowledfre of nutural history, much attached to the studj 

 of the American llaptoree, and an especial admirer of the Owls. 



SviiNiCM albo-yiilarix, nobi.9. Entire jiliimape above deep umber brown, 

 every feather more or leas finely vermicnlated and minutely spot'ed with black ;

 the region of the occiput, where upon some feathers the white spots are disposed 

 regularly in pairs, upon the opposite webs. 



Feathers of the back and rump having al.so three or four irregular transverse 

 lines, aud irregularly spotted with pale brownish nearly white. Scapular* 

 broadly barred and edged with white. 



Lessser wing coverts with irregular lines of pale brownish, and with large 

 white marks on their external webs. Primaries with their external webs nearly 

 black, with about eight to twelve square spots or bands cf fulvous. Inte.-nal 

 webs of primaries plain black or with obscure bands. 



Eyebrow white ; a large semicircular segment of white covering the jaws 

 and throat, interrupted at the base of the under mandible by a few brownish 

 feathers ; many of those white feathers conspicuously lipped with black, forming 

 a well defined semicircular discal collar, or ruff. 



Breast with a broad band of same umber brown as the back, every feather- 

 irregularly lined and minutely spotted with black, many of the feathers also with 

 Eubrounded spots of pure white, occasionally disposed in pairs. 



Abdomen, flanks, and under tail coverts fulvous, every feather marked longitu- 

 dinally with black, and about one to three transverse marks of the same colour, 

 assuming a partially lyrate form ; these marks less distinct on the flanks. 



Tail umber brown, with about eight to ten irregular pale brownish white 

 bars : under surface paler. 



Plumage of the tarsi reaching nearly to the toes, pale reddish fulvous ; tibial 

 plumage darker, inclining to ferruginous ; toes naked. 



Bill yellow. 



Total length about 9| inches, wing 8, tail 4} inches. 



Bab. South America. 



Two specimens of this bird in the Kivoli collection are without label, a third 

 obtained in Paris by Mr. Edward Wilson is labelled " South America." 



I am acquainted with no species which in any considerable degree resembles 

 the bird now described, nor have I met with a description applicable to it. 



Syrxium virgatum, nobis. Plumage of the entire upper surface dark umber 

 brown, every feather having about three to five irregular transverse narrow 

 bands of sordid yellowish white, most numerous and distinct on the head and 

 rump. Upper tail coverts banded with pure white. 



Scapulars obliquely banded on their outer webs with fulvous, on their inner 

 webs more or less regularly banded with yellowish white. Wing coverts with 

 broader bands, and also mottled and pointed at their tips with whitish.

1848.] 125 



square spots of grayish white, some of which enclose central spots of dark 

 brown, and all more or less dotted and mottled with the same colour. These 

 square spots less regular on the first and second primaries ; all the primaries 

 with broad pale tips. Internal webs with regular bands of dark and paler 

 brownish black. 



General colour of the face same as the head and back, superciliary plumage 

 and discal circle nearly white, more or less spotted and lined with deep brown. 



Breast deep umber brown tinged with fulvous, every feather having about 

 three very irregular transverse bands, which are broader and paler than those of 

 the back, thous^h of the same character; on the lower part of the breast these 

 bands are nearly white. 



Abdomen pale fulvous, every feather with a longitudinal stripe of black, and 

 ■with one or two transverse irregular bands at the tip of the same colour, ventral 

 region and under tail coverts pale fulvous, nearly white, with a trace of blackish 

 spots. 



Tarsi dark fulvons, mottUd with brown ; feathered to the toes. 



Tail black, tipped with white, and bavingaboutfivebands, which are brownish 

 on the outer and white on the inner webs. 



Bill horn colour at the base, pale yellow at the tip, toes quite naked. 



Total length abnul 14 inches, wing 10^, tail 6 inches. 



Tounger or different sex? Pale bacds on the superior surface of the body 

 broader, those on the wing coverts, primaries and secondaries, enclosing toler- 

 ably regular bands of black. Scapulars with their outer webs fulvous and pure 

 white. 



Spots on the outer webs of the primaries, and bands on the tail nearly white, 

 secondaries broadly lipped with white, each terminal spot enclosing a segment of 

 dark brown. 



Entire inferior surface of the body fulvous, feathers having longitudinal stripes 

 only of dark brown ; under tail coverts nearly pure white. 



Younger? Bands on the back and rump almost obsolete, having the appear- 

 ance of spots only. Scapulars and some of the wing coverts broadly edged with 

 pure white. 



Entire under surface of the body nearly white, with but a tinge of fulvons, the 

 feathers having longitudinal bands only of deep brown. Under tail coverts and 

 tarsi nearly while. 



Total length about 14 inches, wing 9^, tail 6 inches. 



Uab. South America. 



This is a bird of which I have frequently seen specimens, and am surprised 

 that I have not succeeded in finding a description of it. I am acquainted with no 

 species intimately resembling it.

The first discovery of this curious and interesting falcon, within the limits of 

 our fauna, is due to the ornithological zeal of Edward Harris, Esq., of New 

 Jersey, who exhibited to the Academy a specimen obtained by himself on the 

 Miami river of Florida, in May, 184-i, which, together with many new and rare 

 birds obtained during his travels with Audubon on the Upper Missouri, he has 




1848.] 127 



since generously added to our rich collections. My friend Dr. A. L. Heerman 

 has given me one of four specimens obtained in a recent trip to Florida, with 

 the following memorandum. " On Saturday, May 6th, while fishing in the ever- 

 glades near the source of the Miami river, I shot four of these birds, of which 

 two were females and the others young ; the latter showing by their plumage 

 that they had been bred in the country. On dissecting them, I found their 

 stomachs filled with a species of snail, which lives on the rank grasses of the 

 everglades. They seemed unaware of danger, and were sailing together in the 

 manner of the Mississippi Kite. I also saw on the 8th of May, seven of these 

 birds in the air over Col. English's plantation, who informed me that it was by 

 no means a rare bird in that part of the country." 



All the specimens are in immature plumage, and vary considerably. They 

 are above dark brown, beneath dull white, much blotched with brown : the 

 shoulders, and under wing coverts particularly, strongly tinged withfurruginous. 

 The front and throat are sometimes nearly pure white, but generally tinged with 

 ferruginous and streaked with brown. 



The plumage of the adult, is of a nearly uniform blackish brown, with the 

 tall at its base, and upper and under coverts pure white.

 Jamaica. 



Though long since suspected by Nuttall as occasionally straying into the 

 forests of the Southern States, this species has only recently been actually 

 detected by Dr. Heerman in the peninsula of Florida. He found it rather com- 

 mon about Charlotte Harbour, and procured several specimens. In their search 

 for food he observed them clinging to the branches with the back downwards, 

 and found their stomachs filled with coleopterous insects and flies.

Ardea Pealei, Bonap. Amer. Orn. vol. 4, pi. 36; Nutt. Man. Orn. Tol. 2, p. 

 49 ; A. rufescens, young, Aud. Bonap. Gray. 



Peale's Egret has, I am satisfied, been too hastily considered as the young of 

 the Reddish Egret, strange to say, even by Bonaparte himself,- who, i.u the 

 article upon that bird in the continuation of Amer. Orn., has so well examined 

 the family to which it belongs, and particularly states, that they do not acquire 

 their full plumage until the third year ; young birds being always destitute of the 

 peculiar ornamental plumes. Now, the well known fact that the Herons when 

 young do not have the elongated feathers of the adult, is prima facie evidence 

 that jE. Pealei cannot be the young of JE. rufescens, when it is ornamented with 

 plumes quite as long and full, and neither in bill or any other part shows the 

 slightest trace of immaturity. But to Dr. Heerman we are indebted for the 

 means of settling the question beyond dispute. 



* Comparative List of the Birds of Europe and North America. 




128 [December, 



lie found thou bri^nlintf ia (frcat numh'irs at Charlille Iliirhour, in Florida 

 snd visited tho brocditit^ place lliree successive times, to a»-ure himself that the 

 jouoR birda are not while, but coloured like the aduUa, only of a duller hue, and 

 without plumes ; as be whs also informed by bis host. He did not see a single 

 while specimen amonjf hundreds of young birds, and bus presented to the Aca- 

 demy the true young of A', rufcsccnt. 



This specimen which is j'ist fully fledged, with a few woolly feathers yet re- 

 maining about Ihe head, is developing the colours of the adu!l rufescntx, without 

 a single while feiither. But what is most convincing, is, ihnl the bill is entirely 

 dusky, with a mere indication that its base will become pale. 



Peal's HIgret is a smuUer bird and less in its proportions every way. The 

 young also is pure white like the adult, but wants the elongated plumes, and has 

 the bill entirely dusky, the basal portion gruduully assuming its pale colour 

 as 13 seen in a specimen brought by Dr. Ileerman.

Nuttall was the first to observe differences between the little Terns of Europe and 

 those of America, and supposed ours to be the same with the S. aryenlea of Brazil, 

 described by ihe Piince de Wied. II iviog specimens, however, of that species 

 in the collections of the Academy, I liud it vtry distinct from either, and readily 

 distinguished tiy its very much larger, thicker bill, longer, differently coloured 

 winf.'s, shorter tail, &c. 



Like all the closely allied species of Europe and North America, which differ 

 not so much in colour as in form and proportion, the little Terns of the two con- 

 tinents resemble each other so closely, that it is difficult to determine specific 

 characters. Hut as those species which inhabit a wide range in either country, 

 and not confined to tue northern regions, are nearly always found distinct, so the 

 little Terns, ex'ending as they do to the tropics, and not having been as yet found 

 in the arctic regions, should also, according to the laws of geographical distri- 

 bution, be different. 



Some of the distinctions drawn by Nuttall I think will be found dependant on 

 age. The bill in specimens which I have com[)ared of the American is shorter 

 and smaller in its measurements every way, the wings aud tarsi are also shorter, 

 and the outer tail feathers more acuminate than in the European, but still I should 

 have hesitated to give it a new name, had it not been considered different hy 

 several ornithologists and erroneously referred to S. ar(/entea of De Wied.

This noble species so abundant on our southern roast, has for a long time been 

 considered the aS'. cayana of Latham, notwithstanding its disparity with his de- 

 scription both in size and coloration. It seems to me that the Cayenne Tern 

 must have been founded upon the immature plumage of one of the yellow-billed 

 species of the Brazilian coast, since described by Lichtcustein, probably the 

 S. magnirostris. 



Young birds of our species would agree pretty well with the erythrorhyncha 

 of Brazil, described by the Prince De Wied, as they are somewhat smaller and less 

 proportioned, yet we hesitate to give it that name, until its identity can posi- 

 tively be proved, particularly as the Terns of that coast are peculiar. 



The representative of the regia iu the old world, is the S. velox of Eiippell. 

 though quite distinct. 



Sterna elegans, Gamb. 



Adult male. — With the general plumage of S. regia; length 17 in. ; of wing 

 12^ in. : of outer tail feathers 6 and 8-lOths in. : tarsus 1 and 1-lOth iu. : middle 

 toe and nail 1 and 2J-10ths in.: bill bright red, along the ridge 1 and 6- 10th in.: 

 from corner of mouth, 3 and 3-lOths in. : from symphysis to point beneath \h 

 in. : depth at commencement of feathers 5-10th3 in. 



This elegant species differs from the former not only in proportions, but in 

 the delicate hue of the under parts, which are of a satiny cream color when 

 living, but faded very much in the dried specimen. 



The bill is of the same color as in the regia, and as long, but much more slender ; 

 the prominent angle beneath half an inch farther from the point, and the depth at 

 base two tenths of an inch less. Wings two and a half inclies shorter, but of the 

 same color in every respect. Legs pure black, the tarsus nearly as long as iu 

 the former, but the toes much shorter. Tail long, pure white and deeply forked, 

 ■whole top of head from the bill, pure black, extending into an ample flowing 

 crest as in the former species. 



Tlie representative of this species in the old world is the S. affinis, Riippell, but it 

 differs from that species in nearly the same respects as iS. 7-egia does from S. velox. 



I procured this species on the Pacific coast of Mexico, particularly at Mazatlan 

 at the mouth of the Gulf of California. Itis exceedingly delicate in its plumage, 

 and graceful in its mode of flight. Ifouod them congregated in numbers on the 

 sandy shoals of the Bay in the mouth of April, uttering as they flew a grating 

 Kingfisher-like note.

The whole have been derived from the following sources: from authors 79 ; 

 from editors 24; from members, correspondent?, and others 70 ; from Societies 

 72 ; from Dr. Wilson, on deposit, 1029; from Dr. R. E. Griffith, on deposit, 72. 

 Three Charts of the United States coast Survey were received fiom the Trea- 

 sury Department, through Prof. A. D. Bache. 



The aggregate additions to the Library in 1847, as stated in the report of that 

 year, amounted to 1072, the greatest number in any single year since 1835, 

 when Mr. Maclure's donations were received. The additions of the present 

 year exceed those of 1847 by 277. 




1848.] 131 



The deposits by Dr. WiI?on in 1847 were remarkable for their number and 

 value. In their selection also, and in their adaptation to the wants of the 

 Society, which it has always been his chief desire and pleasure to consult, the 

 excellent judgment characteristic of that gentleman was abundantly shown. 

 The obligations then incurred were sufficiently great, but the statement just 

 presented, exhibits a total of additions derived from him this yearnearly double 

 that of the last year. 



The entire number of volumes, periodicals and serials in parts or numbers, 

 and pamphlets, which Dr. Wilson has deposited to the present date, is as follows :

To our fellow -member, Dr. Robert E. Griffith, belongs the credit of being the 



next largest contributor to the Library during the present year, as he was also 



in 1847. Nearly 250 works have been added by Dr. Griffith within the last two 



years ; many of them highly valuable for their antiquity and rarity. 



Among the contributions this year, is a fine copy of Vyse's celebrated and 

 splendid work on the Pyramidsof Egypt, in elephant folio, for which the Society 

 is indebted to Dr. Samuel George Morton. To the same gentleman it is also 

 under great obligations for a donation of the first five volumes of the Asiatic 

 Researches. The Academy's series of that important and frequently consulted 

 work is now nearly complete, one volume only being wanting. The Academy 

 had also the singular good fortune to obtain, at the same period, another set of 

 the same volumes, from its venerable President Mr. William Hembel. 



Through the liberality of the late Mrs. Elizabeth Stott, of Philadelphia, the 

 Library has been enriched the present year by the addition of WalJich's ele- 

 gant work, Plantffi Asiaticae Rariores, in three large folio volumes. 



To the different scientific Societies, American and foreign, with which the 

 Academy is in correspondence, its acknowledgments are due for their usual 

 courtesy and attention, in furnishing their transactions and other publications; 

 especially to the Zoological and Linnean Societies of London, the British Asso- 

 ciation, the Geneva Society, the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Royal Agricul- 

 tural Society of Ljons, the Royal Bavarian Society, the Imperial Society of 

 Naturalists of Moscow, the Imperial Mineralogical Society of St. Petersburg, 

 the American Philosophical Society, the New York Lyceum, the Boston Society 

 of Natural History, and the American Academy. 



From numerous distinguished correspondents, authors, &c., and from editors 

 of scientific journals, at home and abroad, the Academy continues to receive 

 their valuable publications, regarding them as evidences of the general interest 

 felt in its success, and of their desire to promote its objects and usefulness. 



The rapid accumulations from all these sources during the last few years, 

 have now nearly occupied the available space in theirpresent apartment, which, at 

 the time of the removal of the Library into it from the Hall, less than two years 

 ago, was considered ample enough for any ordinary rate of increase for a consid- 

 erable period. If, therefore, the Society should be so fortunate as to continue to 




182 [December, 



ei^oj even a mo'lerate share of that liberality which latterly has Vjeen bo lavishly 

 bOBtowffd upon the Library, it will become Dfccgsary duriii^^tbe ensuing year to 

 decide upon some plan for furnishing additional accommodationa for the Booka 

 in the adjoining rooms. 



A new printed catalogue of the Library, or an appendix to the last, will soon 

 be required. The present catalogue was published in the year 1837, and em- 

 braced, according to the report of the Cotuniiitee ai)pointed to prepare it, C390 

 volumes, besides 435 .Maps and Charts. The Library has rapidly increased 

 since that date, and at the present time cannot contain le^s than 10,00u volumes, 

 maps, charts, &c. An accurate enumeration will, however, be made of the 

 works contained in each department, and the result aubmitted in the next 

 annual report. 



Hich as are the collections of works in the Library, on Natural History, Voy- 

 ages and Travels, History, Biography, Antiquity and the Fine Arts, ^c, and 

 liberal as have been the recent additions of Dr. Wilson, we are still greatly 

 deficient in the transactions of foreign learned societies. In this Institution 

 these publications are of indispensable importance for successfully conducting 

 investigations in the dilTerent branches of science. From the gratifying testi- 

 monials which the Academy continually receives of the estimation in which it 

 is held by distinguished societies abroad, we are encouraged to believe, that a 

 more extended correspondence, and oflFer of interchange of publications with 

 these bodies, would be followed by the desired result, and the deficiencies 

 promptly supplied. 



The design stated in the last annual report of furnishing to the Society a list 

 of miscellaneous works, which it is proposed to reject from the Library, has 

 been unavoidably deferred until next year. The propriety of this measure is 

 generally admitted by the members, the space which these books now occupy 

 being greatly needed for the accommodation of others of more utility. 



There are also duplicates of many natural history works of much value, 

 which might be advantageously exchanged. A list of these will also be pre- 

 pared and presented to the Society at an early period. 



Wm. S. Zaxtzingeb, 



Librarian. 



Hall of the Academy, December 2G(h, 1848. 



The following Report of tlie Curators was read by the Chairman, Dr 

 Leidy, and ordered to be published. 



REPORT 



OF THE CURATORS 



For 1848. 



The impetus given to the progress of the Academy within a few years by the 

 extensive and valuable additions to its museum and library from several of its 

 members, still continues in full vigor. The treasures of nature are constantly 

 being poured into its stores, sister societies observe us with emulation, and onr 

 journal is abundantly supplied with original memoirs on subjects of Natural 

 History. 




1848.] 133 



Since the report of the Curators for 184'7 was presented to the Academy, the 

 Eastern and North-East basement rooms, appropriated to part of the museum, 

 have been finished, and the collections in Mineralogy, Conchology, Entomology, 

 &c., have already been nearly arranged in them. 



Further accommodations also have been made for the extension of the Orni- 

 thological collection in the hall of the Academy, by the construction of a row 

 of foot cases on the outer edge of the upper or third gallery, similar to those 

 previously existing on the same part of the second gallery. 



Every department of the museum has been, and continues to be, carefully 

 attended to, and to most of them, additions have been made during the year 

 1848, of which we will now give a summary. 



The Mammalogical collection, in its present condition, numbers 234 mounted 

 specimens, besides a number of skins, all in a good state of preservation. It 

 has received an addition of 16 specimens during the past year, principally from 

 Drs. Watson, Wilson, Goddard, and Mr. Wm. Wood. 



The Ornithological cabinet, under the patronage of Dr. Wilson, still continues 

 to be the most extensive department of our museum, as well as one of the 

 richest collections in the world. This gentleman, during the past year has 

 greatly increased it, by the deposit of the second portion of the Rivoli collec- 

 tion, containing 2584 specimens, and the collection known as that of M. Boucier, 

 of France, comprising 1039 specimens. We have also to acknowledge our 

 indebtedness to the liberality of Mr. Edward Harris, for the donation of a col- 

 lection of rare North American birds, including nearly all the species discovered 

 by Harris and Audubon during the last expedition of those gentlemen to the 

 mouth of the Yellow Stone river. Besides the foregoing, we have received 

 from members and others 14 specimens, several of which are unic-iue, as the 

 Picus Lecontei, from Dr. Jones, of Georgia, &c. 



Dr. Wm. Gambel, the Recording Secretary, presented to the Society, a few 

 evenings since, a complete catalogue of the Columbidte in the Academy's col- 

 lection. Catalogues of the Vultures and Owls are also nearly ready, and wil 

 appear in an early number of the Proceedings. 



To our collection in Oology has been added, through the kindness of Professor 

 Baird, of Carlisle, a donation of eggs of 56 species of 41 genera of American birds, 

 24 species of which were accompanied by the nests. To Dr. Heerman we 

 must also express our thanks for seven rare species of eggs from Florid 



The Conchological department is still in progress of arrangement by Dr. R. E. 

 Griffith, in the horizontal cases occupying the floor of the east basement room 

 and has been much enriched during 1848 from the private cabinets of Dr. Grif- 

 fith and Dr. Wilson. These latter have not yet been formally presented through 

 the Curators. We are much indebted to Dr. T. S. Savage, whose zeal in science 

 is only excelled by his former labors in the religious office of missionary to 

 Western Africa, for the donation of 226 specimens of shells, comprising 120 

 species of 60 genera of rare shells from Western Africa. To Mr. Andrew R. 

 Chambers, of Philadelphia, the gratitude of the Society is owing for the gift of 

 two cabinets, containing 1200 specimens of shells, being part of the well-known 

 Hyde collection, formerly deposited in Peale's museum. 



The collection of Crustacea has been arranged by Dr. Bridges during the past 




134 [Dkck.muek, 



summer io llie norih-east basement room of the Academy. Daring the year 

 we have received nine apecimens. 



The collection in Herpelology and Ichthyology ia at present undergoing 

 arrangement preparatory to ita removal to the Hying gallery in the east base- 

 ment room. The number of species of Replilia is as follows: Ualruchia 120; 

 Sauria IJO; Uphidia 212; Chelouia? A conjectural estimate of the number 

 of fishes amounts to 450 species. During 1848, the collection received an addi- 

 tion of \'i species of re]>tilia, and IG species of fishes. 



The collection in Com[>arative Anatomy ia in good condition, gradually ic- 

 creases, and comprises at present, exclusive of Dr. Morton's extensive series ef 

 human crania, 307 crania of mammttlia, G58 do. of birds, C3 do. of replilia, 30 

 do. of fishes, and .39 mounted skeletons. 1 he collection of Dr. Morton continues 

 to be probably the lrtr;^e6t in the world, numbering at present Hl'J human crania, 

 besides 28 casts of crania of various nations, ancient and modern. During 1848 

 we have received 12 mounted skeletons, from Drs. Wilson, Watson, Meigs, and 

 Hallowell, and Messrs. Germain, Lambert, and Ashmead ; 21 crania from Dr. 

 Wilson ; and the deposit of 73 crania, principally human, by Dr. Morton. 



The collection in Palaeontology, eo far as arranged, ia contained in the two 

 double rows of horizontal cases occupying the floor of the hall, which, when the 

 Kit report of the Curators was written, had not been finished. It has been 

 greatly enriched during the past year from a variety of sources. We express our 

 thanks for a niagniflcent, and, to the .\merican palreontologist for study and com- 

 parison, an Invaluable gift, from the Honourable Court of Directors of the East 

 India Company, consisting of 124 well made and coloured casts of fossils from 

 the Sivalik Hills of India, comprising casts of fragments of 36 species of 25 genera 

 of mammalia ; 1 species of bird ; 5 species of 4 genera of reptilia ; and 1 species 

 of fish. We cannot appreciate too highly the intelligence of this honourable and 

 celebrated body, when a voluntary gift of such an expensive character is madei 

 having no other object in view than the promotion of science. We also feel our 

 indebtedness to Dr. Thomas Ilorsfield, Curator of the East India Company's 

 museum, for a fine cast of the cranium of Sivatherium gigaoteum, the original of 

 which is in the British Museum. To the memory of the late Dr. Carpenter, of 

 New Orleans, we owe our grateful recollections, for the donation of one-half of 

 the inferior maxilla and several teeth of the fossil Tapirus Americanus. To Dr. 

 T. B. Wilson, the lasting gratitude of the Academy is owing, for the largest and 

 most valuable donation in natural history probably ever made in America, con- 

 sisting of the following collections : Mr. Conrad's collection of American fossils, 

 cont.tining about 3000 specimens and 1000 species; (in this collection are the 

 originals of Dr. Morton from the cretaceous formation ;) a general collection 

 of British fossils, containing 9402 specimens, comprising 2935 species; (this 

 co'.lection includes the selected specimens from the cabinet of the late Miss 

 Bennett, of England;) a collection of 2155 specimens, comprising 501 species, 

 from the cretaceous formation of Frame; a collection of German fossils, 

 containing 650 specimens of 500 species; a collection of Italian fossils 

 t'iom the teniary of Piedmont, containing 2000 specimens of 600 epecies ; the 

 total of which is 17,207 specimens, and 5545 species. Dr. Wilson has also 

 depojited a very perfect specimen of Icbtbyosaurus inlermedius. To Mr. Joseph 




1848.] 135 



Culbertson, we arc indebted for the deposit of the unique specimens of the new 

 genus of fossil mammalia Merycoidodon. The Professors of the Jardin des 

 Plantes have presented to us several of their beautifully made casts of Auoplo- 

 therium and Palcotherium. Besides the foregoing we have received 128 speci- 

 mens from various members and others. 



In Entomolog}', it affords us pleasure to say, that the collection is in an ex- 

 cellent state of preservation, and is in steady progress of arrangement by Dr. 

 Zantzinger, and from the many donations in the past two years already numbers 

 several thousand specimens of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. The impression which 

 Tinfortunately exists, that this department of natural science is not sufficiently 

 cared for in this institution, we hope will be henceforward removed. Members 

 and friends of the Academy need not now hesitate before presenting or depositing 

 collections of insects in the institution, as the danger of their destruction from neg- 

 lect or other causes no longer exists. At present, this like the other departments, is 

 under the constant supervision of two officers, whose duty it is not to permit any 

 portion of the property of the Society which is placed in their charge to suffer from 

 neglect or depredation. In the course of the last year Dr. Wilson presented 200 

 specimens of American and foreign Lepidoptera to the cabinet. We also acknow- 

 ledge our indebtedness to Mr. Wm. Hobson, of Kingsessing, for the donation of 

 500 determined specimens of British Coleoj)tera ; to Mr. Edward Doubleday, of 

 the British Museum, for a very fine collection of about 900 determined and ar- 

 ranged species of British Coleoptera ; and to Dr. A. L. Heerman, our fellow mem- 

 ber, for numerous specimens of American Lepidoptera, chiefly from Key West, 

 Florida, many of which are rare. 



The Cabinet of Mineralogy and Geology during the past summer has been 

 carefully and almost completely arranged by our fellow members Messrs. 

 Vaux, Ashmead and GambeL It has received some rich additions during the 

 last year, among which should be particularly mentioned a very large and 

 valuable donation from Dr. Wilson, numbering in all 2039 specimens, almost 

 exclusively European, many of them of the rarest and choicest character. 

 Our cabinet of European minerals is now one of the best in the country, although 

 still very deficient in American specimens. The example which has been set 

 by Dr. Wilson we hope maj- induce others to supply this deficiency. 



To M. Bourcier of France, through Dr. Wilson, we have become indebted for 

 the donation of 70 very fine specimens of blue and green carbonate, and red oxide 

 of copper, among which are many and rare modifications of the primitive crystal- 

 line form. Nor should we fail to mention the deposit by Mr. Vaux, of an enormous 

 crystal of Beryl, weighing 185 lbs., from Acworth, New Hampshire. Besides 

 these there were presented 40 specimens of minerals by several of the members 

 and others. Among them, are some of the more lately discovered minerals, pre- 

 eented by Mr. Markoe of Washington, and some fine specimens of Elba iron 

 ore from Dr. Carson. 



The unrestricted admission of persons to the museum of the Academy upon the 

 afternoons of Tuesdays and Saturdays, having been found to be attended with 

 some injury and even destruction of its furniture, caused the Society, 

 last year, to change one of the days of exhibition, viz. Saturday to Friday, and 

 to issue gratuitous tickets of admission, to be obtained from members upon ap- 

 plication. This arrangement has been followed by the most beneficial effects- 




136 [Decembze, 



persons really desirous of inspecting the collections, take the trouble to procure 

 ft ticket, with which they feel responsible for their conduct; the introduction of 

 crowds is also avoided, which, from constant motion, give rise to dust, so detri- 

 mental to the more perishable articles in a natural history collection. The janitor, 

 uhokceps a register of tiic names and residences of visitors to the Museum ontho 

 E.xiiibition days, informs mc that upwards of three thousand persons have availed 

 themselves of this privilege since the middle of May last, when the new 

 arrangement went into effect. This is an average of about 380 admissions pci 

 mouth, or nearly 5000 per annum.

 salt on the surf;ice, that wagons, or loaded mules, can be driven over it, without 

 danger of breaking through. The rapidity of its formation, without any artificial 

 process, or mechanical aid, is most remarkable, as the inhabitants cut it out, in 

 large blocks or cakes, around the margin of the lake, and in a day or two it is 

 replaced by another supply equally thick." Brought from Meiamoras by CoL

January 9 th, 18 19. 

 Mr. AsHMEAD in the Chair. 



Letters were read from Dr. B. F. Shumard, dated Louisville, Ken- 

 tucky, November 20, 1848, and Dr. L. P. Yandell, of same date, 

 severally acknowledging the receipt of their notices of election as 

 Correspondents. 



A letter was read from H. Smith, M. D., dated St. James' Place, 

 London, 1st December, 1848, proposing exchanges of Reptilia with 

 the Academy, and transmitting a list of those in his possession. Re- 

 ferred to the Curators. 



Prof. H. D. Rogers stated that his views of the formation of moun- 

 tain ridges by the upheaving of the crust of the earth from subterranean 

 causes, had been amply confirmed in a tour to Europe, which he re- 

 cently made for that purpose. 



Dr. Leidy offered the following observations on the existence of the 

 intermaxillary bone in the embryo of the human subject : 



The immortal Goethe, I believe, was the first to point out the existence of the 

 OS iatermaxillare in the human subject, but it has only been observed in an 

 abnormal condition, or where there has been an arrest of developnient in con- 

 nection with some cases of hare-lip ; and the period of life in which it is found 

 as a distinct piece, audits exact limits, have not yet been accurately determined.. 

 The universality of the presence of the os intermaxillare in all animals below 

 man, its presence as a distinct piece in an abnormal condition in man always 

 defined by a lateral fissure which characterizes it as the incisive bone, and the 

 uniform existence of a transverse fissure behind the incisive alveoli of the os 

 maxillare superius of the human foetus at birth, have led many anatomists to 

 suspect its normal aad independent existence in the embryotic condition of man 

 at an earlier period than it has been sought for. 



As the neyro in his anatomical characters is not so far removed from the 

 embryological condition as the while, it is to be presumed that the intermaxillary 

 bone would remain longer distinct ; and under such an impression I have sev- 

 eral times desired medical students, from our Southern States, whose opportur 

 nities of investigating the anatomy of the negro are frequent, to make this a 

 subject of inquiry. Such an opinion cannot be considered unworthy of attention, 

 when it is recollected that Tschudi mentioas the existence of a true os interpa- 

 rietale, as a constant condition, in certain branches of the aboriginal inhabitants 

 of Peru, the Chinchas, Aymaras and Huancas. 



Recently having had an opportunity of examining several human embryos, in 

 one of them I was fortunate enough to detect the intermaxillary bone as a dis- 

 tinct and independent piece. This embryo measured one inch and eleven 

 lines from heel to vertex, and I presumed it to be abbut nine or ten weeks old. 

 In it ossification had already advanced in the superior maxillary and inter-

[January, 



maxillary bones sufficicntlj to give them a determinate form, and their appear- 

 ance, when magnified, is represented in tlio figures I and 2, which were taken 

 from the Epecimens through the aid of the camera lucida. 



Fig. 1. Fig. 2. 



Fig. 1 represents the superior maxillary and intermaxillary bones, much mag- 

 nified, of a human embryo. The drawing was taken from the right side through 

 the aid of the camera lucida, which reverses its position, a. superior maxillary 

 bone; 6. intermaxillary bone ; c. line of articulation between the two bones; 

 d. palatine process : e. alveolar groove. 



Fg. 2 represents the antero-inferior surface of the separated intermaxillary 

 bone, much magnified. (From the left side, but reversed by the camera.) a. 

 ascending or nasal process; b. articulating surface for the superior maxillary 

 bone ; c. incisor alveoli. 



The greatest breadth of the two bones in apposition is one line and two-thirds; 

 the greatest height, being at the ascending or nasal process, in one line. The 

 two pieces present a facial portion, consisting of the ascending or nasal process 

 and part of the body of the bones ; an alveolar ridge and groove and a palatine 

 process projecting backward from the superior maxillary bone. They are easily 

 separable at this period, and the articulation passes through the alveolar ridge, 

 at a point corresponding to the separation between the incisor alveoli and the 

 canine alveolus, and extends transversely inwards behind the incisor alveoli^ 

 and vertically upwards, dividing the nasal process into two nearly equal por- 

 tions. On the posterior surface of the nasal process the articulation is at the 

 bottom of a comparatively deep and wide groove, which however does not ap- 

 pear to be part of the lachrymal canal, as the latter appears afterwards and ex- 

 ternal to the former groove. The preparations exhibiting these interesting 

 points which prove the existence of the same law, throughout the animal king- 

 dom, governing the formation of the upper maxillary bones, I present for the 

 inspection of the members of the Academy. 



In an embryonic skelton in the Wistar Museum, measuring three and oe«

eighth inches in length, and purporting to be about nine weeks old, which, 

 however, I think too youug, the maxillo-intermaxillary articulation is still 

 evident at the ascending process, but it does not divide the latter so equally, 

 being more internal and inferior, apparently from a more rapid development of 

 the nasal process of the true maxillary bone. Just above the alveolar ridge they 

 are already anchylosed together. 



In another embryo, in the same museum, measuring three and one-fonrth 

 inches in length, the two bones have become firmly united, excepting behind the 

 incisor alveoli, but the line of original separation is readily traced out, from a 

 greater degree of thinness and transparency along its course. The nasal process 

 of the true maxillary bone has so much increased beyond the nasal process of 

 the intermaxillary bone, that the latter no more ascends to the summit of the 

 former, but is considerably inferior and internal. 



In the foetal skeleton, measuring five inches in length, all traces of the inter- 

 articulation have disappeared, except behind the incisor alveoli, which latter 

 portion, as is well known, does not usually disappear until some time after birth, 

 and in some instances is found in the adult cranium. 



January 2Sdj 1849. 



Mr. Phillips in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Baroness Berzelius, dated Stockholm, 

 September 15, 1848, announcing to the Academy the decease of her 

 late husband, the Baron Berzelius, a Correspondent of this Institu- 

 tion. 



January SOth, 1849. 

 Dr. Bridges in the Chair. 



The Auditors reported that they had examined the account of the 

 Treasurer for 1848, and had found it correct. 



The Monthly Report of the corresponding Secretary was read and 

 adopted. 



The resolution offered by Dr. Leidy, at the last meeting for business, 

 was then taken up, that the following Article of the By-Laws be 

 amended : 



" Chap. Qth, Art. 1. There shall be seven standing Committees, 

 viz, — the Auditors, to consist of three members ; the Mineralogical 

 and Geological Committee, and the Zoological Committee, to consist 

 of seven members each ; the Publication, Library and Botanical Com- 

 mittees, and the Committee on Physics, to consist every one of five 

 members, whose term of service shall be one year. And all these, 

 except the Auditors and Publication Committee, shall be elected at 

 the last meeting of January in each year." 



So as to read thus : 



" There shall be fifteen Standing Committees, viz. : 1. The Ethno- 

 logical Committee ; 2, the Committee on Comparative Anatomy and 




148 [Januahy, 



General Zoology; 3, Committee on Mammalogy ; 4, on Ornithology ; 

 5, on llerpctology and Ichthyology; G, on Conchology ; 7, on Ento- 

 mology ; 8, on Botany ; 9, on Puloeuntnlogy ; 10, on Geology 

 and Mineralogy ; 11, on IViysirg ; 12, on the Library; 13, on 

 the Prorecditigs; 14, the Auditors; and lo, the Puhlicatitm 

 Committee ; each to consist of three members, whose term of service 

 shall be one year. And all these, except the Auditors and 

 Publication Committee, shall be elected at the last meeting in January 

 of each year." 



The amendment was adopted. 



The Society then proceeded to an election for the Standing Commit- 

 tees, in accordance with the above amended By-Law. The following 

 members were elected.

Notes of the post mortem appearances of a Cynocephalus? which died in the Menagerie 



at Philadelphia. 

 By Edwahd Hallowell, M. D. 



Head. — Brain not examined. 



Thorax. — There are three lobes to the right lung and three to the left. They 

 present a reddish brown color, mottled with grey, and are crepitant except at 

 the base of the lower lobe of the right, which is firm and resisting to the touch. 

 The surface of both lungs is studded with tubercles, deposited beneath the pleu- 

 ral covering. But few are observed in the lobes of the left, or the upper lobes 

 of the right, but they are thickly agglomerated in the lowest lobe of the latter^ 

 which is filled with them ; they are of a light yellow color, from one line and 

 loss to nearly a line in diameter, firm to the touch, and imbedded in a hepatized 

 tissue. The mucous membrane of the trachea and bronchi, traced to the small- 

 est ramifications of the latter, does not present any remarkable degree of red- 

 ness, being rather pale than otherwise. The bronchial glands are enlarged and 

 tuberculous ; the largest is to the right of the trachea, and measures six lines 

 in its greatest extent ; on cutting into it, a quality of white cheesy matter makes 

 its escape. Mucous membrane of the oesophagus pale. The heart is small, 

 measuring one inch four lines in length, by one inch (Fr.) in breadth. The 

 pericardium contains about ateaspoonful of citron-colored serosity. The auri- 

 cles are moderately distended with dark colored blood ; a solitary tubercle 

 about the size of a pin's head is observed at the entrance of the vena cava 

 into the right auricle. 



Abdomen. — The liver has four distinct lobes and a smaller lobule ; it is of a 

 light brown color above, dark green beneath, except in the interspace between 

 the lobes ; it presents numerous tuberculous deposits upon its upper and under 

 surface, of a larger size than are usually met with in the liver — the largest upon 

 the under surface measuring five lines in diameter : on cutting into several of 

 them they are found to he filled with tuberculous matter, of a yellowish colour 

 tinged with green. The spleen is very greatly enlarged, measuring three inches 

 three lines in length, by one and three-quarters in breadth ; it is of a pale red- 

 dish color mottled with white, having its surface throughout studded with tuber- 

 cles ; the central portion, on cutting into it, presents the dark-colored appear- 

 ance usually observed in the spleen, and four or five nodules of tuberculous 

 matter ; upon the periphery of the organ the deposit appears to exist in the form 

 of infiltration, extending four lines within its substance at its posterior extremi- 

 ty. The stomach does not differ materially in shape from the human, and when 

 laid open, measures four inches (Fr.) from one extremity to the other ; there is 

 ' a well marked pylorus ; the oesophagus enters the stomach about midway be- 

 tween the pylorus and the opposite extremity; its muscular fibres are very 

 apparent ; it contains a quantity of greenish looking fluid, having a disagree- 

 able odour ; the mucous membrane is pale throughout, and does not ap- 

 pear softened, presenting no trace whatever of inflamation ; no tubercles are 




152 [Fkurdary. 



observed upon its surface. The small intestine is five feet six and a half inches 

 (Fr.) in extent : it has no valvulae couniventes, neither does it present any ghinds 

 of Pejer, nor are any solitary glamls observed; the intestine, slit nji its entire 

 length, is perfectly pale, both upon its external and inner surface, and no soften* 

 ing of the mucous membrane is noticed ; it contains a quantity of greenish fluid ; 

 no yellowish matter is observed at its upper extremity ; it contains no tubercles, 

 and there are no ulcerations. The large intestine is two feet two and a half 

 inches in extent ; there is a distinct coccum, but no appendicula vermiformis; it 

 contains a quantity of grecni.fh looking fluid, similar to that in the stnall intes- 

 tine ; the mucous membrane throughout is quite pale, and appears to be healthy; 

 held up to the light the mucous follicles are very distinct, but are not very 

 abundant, and are more irregular in their outline than those of the human sub- 

 ject; they are surrounded by a dark-colored border, and several dark points are 

 observed within the circumference of the greater number, (in some of them there 

 are as many as six ) Mesenteric glands more or less tuberculous, and yet the 

 animal does not appear greatly emaciated ; the disease appears to be more fully 

 developed in these glands than in any of the other organ.s ; one of them is much 

 enlarged, measuring fourteen lines by thirteen in size ; adherent to it is another 

 thirteen lines Vjy ten ; these glands are filled with a white homogenous matter, 

 of the consistence of thick cream ; no marks of inflammation are found to exist 

 in any part of the body, except in the lowest lobe of the right lung, where the 

 tubercles are thickly agglomerated, the tissue of the organ being firm and re- 

 sisting to the touch. Both kidneys are tuberculous. They are sixteen lines in 

 length by ten in breadth ; upon the convex margin of the left, near its anterior 

 extremity, is a deposit three lines in diameter, resisting to the touch, and ele- 

 vated considerably above its surface ; it is composed of numerous small white 

 bodies ; other tuberculous deposits, of various sizes, from that of a grain of 

 sand to a line or more in diameter, are observed upon the surface, for which 

 portion of the kidney they appear to have a predilection. Bladder healthy.

It beard a greater resemblance to the Sycobius rubricollia, (Swainson,) Vieill. 

 Ois. chaut. pi. 43, than to any other species which I have found described ; but 

 from this and others it may readily be distinguished by its under tail covert! 

 being crimson, and also by its broad pectoral band of the same color.

Notes of an Examination of the family Vulturidce, in the collection of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 

 6f John Cassin. 

 1. Gi/ps fulvus, (Gm.) 



Under this name, either Ornithologists have confounded several distinct spe- 

 cies, or the species itself assumes an unusual variety of characters. There are 

 now exhibited in the collection of the Academy, sixteen specimens of Vultures, 

 which have been described as at least four species; but as they all bear more 

 or less intimate relationship to the Gyps falvus, (Gm.) of Europe, their claims 

 as distinct species have been but partially recognized, and a question seems to 

 be whether the birds so described, which I may observe, are, for the greater 

 part, from widely different localities, really present characters sufficient to 

 entitle them to specific distinction, or only such as may be attributed to age or 

 season, or to what naturalists have rather vaguely called variety. 



I have long held as a principle, that however small a peculiar character may 

 be, if it is regularly and constantly reproduced in the generation of an animal, 

 or in other words, is uniformly and with certainty transmitted from parent to 

 ojGFspring, that animal is entitled to be regarded as a distinct species, and is 

 different from any other. 



The transmission of character can be, of course, most satisfactorily ascer- 

 tained in the natural habitation of the species, but if a series sufficiently exten- 

 aive, or any considerable number of specimens, invariably present a peculiar 

 character, the student in a museum may assume, quite justly, that he has suffi- 

 cient evidence. 



In the present case the number of specimens is not sufficiently large to war- 

 rant a conclusion, but they appear to present uniformly different character.^ 

 enough to induce the opinion that the following are specifically distinct : Gh/pt 

 fulvus, (Gm.;) Gyps Koll/ii, (Daub.;) Gypi indicus, (Temm.;) Gyps tenuirostris, 

 Hodgson. 



2. Gyps indicus, (Temm.) 



This species is in an extraordinary state of confusion. 



Mr. Temminck describes and figures a Vulture in PI. Col. i., liv. 5. pi. 2e, 

 supposed by him to be the " Vultur indicus. Lath.," which name and authority, 

 he gives at the head of his article, and in the text of same vol., liv. 72, art. V. 

 imperialis, alludes to it as the same as Vultur leuconotua, Gray. 111. Ind. Zool. 




1849.] 159 



pi. 15, which differs so entirely from M. Temminck'g plate, that the latter mast 

 have considered it as either the joung or adult of his species. But it appears 

 that V. leuconotus, Gray, is the adult of Vultur bengalensis, Gm., and it also 

 appears that M. Temminck's plate does not represent the last named species in 

 any known state of plumage, consequently his text and plate refer to different 

 birds. 



Col Sykes in " Catalogue of Birds, observed in Dunkun," Proc. Zoo. Soc, 

 London, 1832, p. 77, gives " Vultur indicus, Lath., Temm., PI. Col. 26," as an 

 abundant species, and the remark is inserted that " Col. Sykes' specimens are no 

 doubt referable to JI. Temminck's species." 



Mr. H. B. Strickland, in Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., xiii., p. 34, presumes 

 Vultur leuconotus. Gray, to be the same as Vultur indicus, Temm. ; and in same 

 Tolume, p. 205, mentions V. indicus. Scop, and Lath., and V. indicus> Temm., 

 as though he meant two species. 



Mr. E. Blyth, in " Remarks upon the birds presented by Mr. Hodgson, to the 

 British Museum," same journal, xx., pp. 315, 387, insists that " Vultur indicus, 

 Scop, and Lath., in Gyps tenuirostris, Hodgson," so that whenever he speaks of 

 Vultur indicus, (as in same jouraal, xiii., p. 115,) he means, of course, Gyps 

 tenuirostris, Hodgson. 



M. C. J. Sundeval, in same journal, xviii., p. 459, speaks of V. indicus, Temm., 

 as a species similar to V. fulvus, but different from V. bengalensis, and evidently 

 is of opinion that V. indicus is distinct from either. He states, too, that he saw 

 none near Calcutta, which were yellowish-brown, and therefore " presumes that 

 the so colored Vultur indicus, never, or rarely, occurs near Calcutta." 



Mr. J. E. Gray, in Catalogue Rap. Birds in Brit. Mas., insert "Vultur ndicas, 

 Temm.," as synonyme for the Gyps fulvus, Gm. 



All the four specimens labelled " Vultur indicus," in the Rivoli collection, are 

 also labelled as coming from South Africa. These specimens comprise two young, 

 one male probably adult, and one female, also probably adult. The young 

 certainly bear a much greater resemblance to M. Temminck's plate than do any 

 others in the collection ; hence I am inclined to the belief, that Vultur indicus, 

 Temm., PL Col. 26, is an African bird, and, as stated in the preceding article 

 a distinct species. 



What " Vultur indicus, Scop, and Lath." may be, is more than 1 can tell from 

 the descriptions, but at any rate, I see no reason to cavil at Mr. Blyth's conclu- 

 sion ; the descriptions of both Scopoli and Latham, and especially the figure in 

 Sonnerat's Voy. India, ii., pi. 105, do appear to me, however, quite unsatisfac- 

 tory. 



3. Sarcoramphus gryphus, (\imn.) 



Naturalists and travellers seem to have decided that the male of this species 

 is the larger. If this is true, it appears to be the only instance in which such is 

 the case in the Rapacious birds, and is a singular exception to the general rule 

 that the female is the larger in this order. 



4. Cathartes aura, (Linn.) 



British and American Naturalists consider this name as applicable to the bird 

 figured by Wilson, Am. Orn. pi. 75, fig. 1, and Audubon, B. of Am. pi. 151 ;bnt 

 some continental European authors have applied it to the Carthartes jota, Molina 

 which is understood to be the same as Vultur atratus, Bartram Travels, p. 289, 

 figured by Wilson, Am. Orn. pi. 75, fig. 2. and Audubon, B. of Am. pi. J.06. 




160 [Febeuary, 



The former are correct, and the latter appear to have been led into error by 

 the statement of Buffon who figores the C. jota in I'l. Enl. 1 «7, and atatea in the 

 text PI. Knl. i, p. l.'Jij, that it is called " ouroaa ou aura." Daudin, Traitc d'Orn. 

 11. p. 10, under C. aura, cites BufTon's plate. Spix. Av. Bras. i. p. 2, describes 

 the C. jola under the name of Cathartes aura, and also citca Buff. PI. Eol. 187. 

 Vieillot, in Ois. de I'Am. Sejjt. pi. 2, figures C. jota, and in his text cites Vultur 

 aura, Linn, as a synonyme, though he also figures the true C aura, Linn., pi. 2, 

 bis. and gives its correct name. 



M. D'Orbigny, in Voy. dans I'Am. llerid. Ois. p. 31, although he describes and 

 figures the C. aura by its proper name, yet quotes C. jota, "Cb. Bonap.," and 

 Vultur atratus, Wilson, Orn. Am. ix. pi. 75, fig. 1, as synonymoa, which is nn 

 error, as he would readily have ascertained by referring to Wilson's figure as 

 quoted by himself. 



There is moreover a further difficulty. It seems desirable to know whether 

 Linnaius described from North or South American specimens, as the Prince Do 

 Wied has described the North American bird as a species distinct from the C. 

 aura, Linn., under the name of Cathartes septentrionalis, De Weid ; — the origi- 

 nal description I have not seen, but it is copied at length in Tschudi's Fauna 

 Peruana, Orn. p. 74. 



It is probably now quite impossible to ascertain from what part of America 

 the specimens described by Linnaeus were actually brought, but fortunately the 

 difficulty last stated, as well as all the former, is easily settled without such 

 knowledge. 



As synonymous with Vultur aura, Linnajus himself in Syst. Nat. I'ltb edition, 

 i., p. 122, cites Catesby, Carolina, 1. pi. 6, and Sloane's Jamaica ii.,pi. 254, both 

 of which are clearly the same bird as that figured by Wilson and Audubon, 

 under the same name, so it would appear sufficiently evident that whatever ether 

 species may inhabit America, the common bird of North America is the true C. 

 aura, Linn. I beg leave to add, that that excellent observer and accurate natu- 

 ralist Mr. George Ord, expressly states, in Am. Orn. ix., p. 99, " The Vultur 

 which Sir Hans Sloane has figured and described is undoubtedly the Vultur 

 aura," that is to say, it is the same as the species figured by Wilson. 



The figure of the head in D'Orbigny's Voyage dans I'Am. Merid., pi. 1, fig. 3, 

 appears to me to be that of the true C. aura, Linn., or the same as the North 

 American species, and the same as that described bv Spix Av. Bras. 1, p. 2, 

 under the name of Cathartes ruficoUis, Spix, which is, therefore, a synonyme. 

 5. Cathartes Burrovianus, Cassin. 



This is a species described by me from a specimen brought from Mexico, and 

 is the smallest of all known Vultures. The Ilivoli collection contains one speci- 

 men of this bird, which is more adult than the specimen described. 



This may be the species which is alluded to by Pennant, in Arctic Zoology, 

 (as quoted by Mr. Ord,) who says that the Turkey Vulture of the West Indies is 

 "far inferior in size to that of North America." 



The plumage of the specimen in the Rivoli collection, is clear black, like that 

 of the specimen previously in the collection of the Academy; the secondaries hav- 

 ing slightly paler margins, but with no mixture or edging of brownish which pre- 

 vails in the plumage of all the specimens of C. aura which I have seen. The 




1849.] 161 



feathers on the neck, instead of forming a perfectly circular, or ring-like ruff, as 

 in C. aura, in the present species, extend decidedly upwards on the back of the 

 neck; in the specimen here alluded to, almost to the occiput. The following 

 are the measurements of the two Sfecies. 



Total length from tip of bill to end of tail 

 (mounted specimens,) 

 Wing from flexure to tip of 



longest primary, 

 Tail, 

 Tarsus, 

 Bill from gap direct to tip, 



6. Cathartes Jo(a^ (Molina.) 

 I am not without suspicion that the bird described by the Abbe Molina, in 



Essay on the Natural History of Chili, p. 245, (M. Gruvel's French translation,) 

 is not the same as the Vultur atratus, Bartram, Travels, p. 289. 



There are in the collection of the Academy three specimens which are clearly 

 the latter, being the same birds given by Wilson and Audubon ; one of these 

 was presenied by Mr. Audubon, another was obtained in Florida, and presented 

 by Dr. McEuen ; the third belongs to the Rivoli collection, but there is a fourth 

 specimen which is materially different. It belongs to the Pdvoli collection and 

 is without label. 



This last specimen is not only much smaller than the former, but it has the 

 head quite smooth and not carunculated or rugose, as in the common species of 

 North America. In fact its head resembles that of the C. aura, (Linn.,) more 

 than it does the C. atratus, (Bart.,) and is covered by such a comparatively clear 

 and smooth skin that I can readily suppose it to be colored in the living bird, 

 which would be strictly as described by the Abbe Molina, or at least as his 

 French translator says for him, p. 246, " sa tete est sans plumes, cooverte d'une 

 peau ridue de couleur rousseP Mr. Audubon, Orn. Biog. ii.,p. 52, describes his 

 bird as " the head having a black, rugose, carunculated skin, sparsely covered 

 with short hairs and downy behind," which is precisely the case in the three 

 specimens alluded to, but I quote Mr. Audubon's description, because he, as 

 well as the Abbe Molina, probably described from recent specimens. 



The one specimen here alluded to is as above stated smaller than either of the 

 others, as will appear by the following measurement's, 



Mr. Audubon's specimen. Smaller specimen. 

 Total length from tip of bill to end of tail, 25 inches IPi 



Wing from the flexure to tip of longest primary, 17 " 15} 



Tail, 7} " 7 



7. The family Vulturidre has been arranged apparently in a manner only 

 provisional according to the Natural System, by Mr. Swainson, Lardner's Cab. 

 Cy. Birds, i. p. 280, and ii. p. 205. 



Notwithstanding such high authority as Mr. Swainson, I am disposed to think 

 the GyT)in3E (of my catalogue) the subtypical group, and the Sarcoramphinoe 

 appear to me to present characters sufficient to warrant the conclusion that 

 Ihey are the true Rasorial Vultures. 



In confirmation of my opinion of the Sarcoramphinse, I may refer to the well 




162 [February, 



kuown fact that the species of f'athurtes are amongst the most confidant and 

 fiimiliar of birds, and that Huch disposition seems also to extend to Sarcoramphua. 

 In a note to " Iletnarks on tlie Minis ohsirvtd in Upper California, " by Dr. 

 William Gamltel, in Jour. Acad. Nut. Sci., Philada. new series, (Quarto) Vol. i. 

 p. 'J J, he mentions having seen at Valparaiso a specimen of the (Jondor so com- 

 pletely domesticated that it was allowed to roam the city at large, and so en- 

 tirely docile that it oflered no resistance to being handled, and would even per- 

 mit the caresses of children, or their attempting to get upon its back. " In fact," 

 he continues. "I think I have never met with any bird which exhibited more 

 tameness or greater confidence in man than this large ("ondor. 



After first premising that in all matters relating to Natural History I am a 

 strict circularian of the school of MacFjeay, Vigors and riwainson, 1 beg Iciive 

 ^o present the following as my views of the classification of the subfamiliea of 

 Vulturidae. 



1. Typical. Vulturinac. 



2. Subtypical, Gypinne. 



3. Natatorial, Gypaetioav 



4. Grallatorial, Ncophrinae. 

 :'•. Rasorial, Sar oramphinfe. 



8. The collection of this Academy contains, probably, all the known Vultures. 

 The only exceptions being, first, the species labelled " Gyps tenuirostris. Hodg.?" 

 it is possible may not be that bird ; and second, a bird tlgured in Brown's Illus- 

 trations of Zoolorry, pi. 1, London, 177G, which is Falco amljustus, Gra., and 

 Vultur ambustus (Gm.) of Latham, and said to inhabit the Falkland Islands, is 

 not in the collection. I suspect, however, that the latter is not truly a Vulture, 

 though it is difficult to determine from the plate above cited. 



There are exhibited in the collection of the Academy sixty-eight specimens of 

 Vultures, which represent nineteen species, including as species the Gyps indicus, 

 (Temm.) G. Kolbii, (Daud.) and G. tenuirostris, Ilodg. 



The Comiuittee on Dr. S. G. Morloii'.s, paper, entitled " Additional 

 observations on a new species of Hippopotamus," reported in favor of 

 publication in the Journal of the Academy.

Professor Agassiz made some observations upon the Crocodilus 

 clavirostris of Morton, and characterized it as a distinct genus under 

 the proposed name of Sphenosaurus. He also referred to the remains 

 of an immense fossil Chelonian, in the collection of the Academy, and 

 found in the green sand of New Jersey. Being allied to the Colosso- 

 chelys of India, Professor Agassiz proposed for it the name of 

 jjtlanfochelys Mortoni. 



Dr. Leidv made some remarks on the intimate structure of the so- 

 called cartilages of the Cephalopoda, and pointed out their strong re- 

 semblance to bone.

On Ciliary cells in some marine nal-ed Molliisca, in embryo. 

 By Wilhelm Keller, M. D. 



In following the development of the ova of different species of Eolis, of the 

 Acteon viridis, and of a little moilusk lately found and described by Mr. Agassiz 

 under the name of Cantops Harvardianus, I often noticed in the surrounding 

 transparent zona, which is falsely considered by au;hors generally as the white 

 of the egg, one or two, seldom more, small moving bodies, which were first ob- 

 served by Professor Volkmann,* who considered and described them as animals. 



The circumstance that the motion is more a rythmic jumping, not very un- 

 like to that of the moving corpuscles of the sperm, and the observation that 

 it always occurs in the same degree of perfection, and only in those eggs in 

 which the cilia at the cephalic end of the embryo have attained their highest 

 development, caused me to think that those moving bodies might be nothing more 

 than detached ciliary cells of the embryo itself, an opinion v/hich I afterwards 

 found advanced in a note by Professor Charles Vogt,f inhis treatise on the devel- 

 opment of the Acteon viridis. To solve this question seemed to me important 

 enough to try the experiment of isolating some of the cells from the animal. 



Before I describe the cell itself I will mention its development, and connection 

 with the animal. So soon as the eggs of the above named animals are laid, they 

 begin immediately the process of division, and when this process has so far ad- 

 Tanced that the yolk globules are so small that they seem to have disappeared, 

 ciliary motion appears at the edges of the yolk. The embryo, so soon as the 

 cilia are formed, rotates sometimes to the right side, sometimes to the left, and 

 changes the direction so soon as there is the least impediment opposed to it. The 

 rapidity of the motion varies; I counted seventy rotations in a minute. The next 

 change in the embryo is real cell formation. There appear cells towards the in- 

 ferior end, which I consider as liver cells ; and which are mother cells, contrary 

 to Professor Vogt's opinion; two cells in the head, the ear cells containing three 

 cells, and a ring of cells provided with long cilia around the head. In the mean 

 time the other cilia are disappearing. The embryo is now no more unconsciously 

 rotating, but the whole body is stretched out, and the only motion observed in it 

 is performed by the long cilia, which are seen folded together like a fan, or 

 playing like the wheel of rotiferous animals. This motion changes very often 

 and seems to be entirely under the control of the animal itself, notwithstanding 

 the animal does not show any formation of nerves, as it only consists of cells at this 

 period, and there is no fibrous structure to be perceived, so that the embryo 

 of these higher animals shows, at least apparently, voluntary motion without a 

 nervous system like the lowest orders of the animal kingdom. By some pressure 



• Versuch einer Monographic des Tergipes Edwardsii," read before the Acad- 

 emy of St, Petersburg, Feb. 9th, 1844. The author calls these cells Cosmella 

 hydrachnoides, and considers them as an instance of spontaneous generation.

the riiij; formed of iho mrtitioned cells appenrs more distiiictlj, ami by crushing 

 the animal with some care the cells muy be isolated, anrl they will be seen to be 

 entirely identical with the animals described by Volkmann under the name of 

 CosmcUa hydrachnoides. Thi-y are round cells with one or two nuclei, having 

 always four very loii^ cilia, which are united in pairs and then fuse together in 

 the cell wall. The motion is a slow rythmical jumping, produced by alternating 

 contraction and expansion of the cell by which the cilia, if not called otherwise for 

 distinction, are made to act like the motion of a whip. But this power of the cells 

 producing the movement, must cause the latter to be considered as something 

 entirely different from ciliary motion, and, in fact, it appears as if a great many 

 different motions were understood under this term, the real nature of which have 

 not yet been studied. 



If we arc led sometimes by first observations to the theory of genrratio 

 aoquivoca, as the facts here presented have done, repeated and more close obser- 

 vation brings us from this extraordinary theory always lack to the old la\v> 

 Omne vivum ex ovo. The supporters of the generatio apquivoca have certainly 

 lost in the separation of these cells from the number of animals, as much as by the 

 discovery that the so-called spermatozoa are but the changed nuclei of cells, 

 formed in the male genital organs of animals. 



As regards the particular movements in organic. formations independent of the 

 nervous system, and even for a certain time indepenilent of the mother animal to 

 •which they belong originally, we have, at the present time, not less than four. 



1. The motion of corpuscles of sperm. Transformed nuclei of cells. 



2. Ciliary motion, roundish or cylindrical, perfect cells of epithelium on 

 free surfaces, with a number of cilia, which are in constant motion independent 

 of the cell. 



3. The Chromatophores of the Sepia. They cover the animal and produce by 

 their constant contraction and expansion, the beautiful colours which it presents. 

 For which reason, Rudolph Wagner, who first observed this interesting phenome- 

 non, called them Chromatophores? 



4. The fourth is a simple cell with four long hair-like appendages, as I have 

 described them. Here the cells contract and the appendages are by this property 

 set in motion. This form has only been observed till now in embryos, whilst 

 the first one belongs only to full grown animals, the ciliary motion is to be found 

 at any age, and the chromatophores only after the animal, which is provided with 

 them, has come to its last type.

 the reproductive organs, and on the fetus of theDelphinus ^iesamak,"

The Committee to whom was referred Dr. Lcidy's remarks on the 

 fragments of the fossil Tapir, deposited in the collociion of the Academy 

 by the late Dr. Carpenter, of New Orleans, reported in favor of publi- 

 cation in the Proceedings. 



Tapirus Americanus /ossilis. 

 By Joseph Leidt, M. D. 



There are three of these fragments ; one of them, being the crown of the fourth, 

 left, permanent premolar of the inferior maxilla, was found near Opelousas, 

 Louisiana, and was described hy Dr. Carpenter, in Silliman's Journal,* so early 

 as the year 1842. It does not differ from the same tooth in the recent Tapims 

 Americanus. The other two fragments, consisting of the left half of an inferior 

 maxillary, and the posterior portion of the left superior maxilla, were found 

 on the banks of the Brasos river, near San Fillipe, Texas, and were described 

 by Dr. C, in Silliman's Joiirnal,t in the year 1846. 



The two fragments did not belong to the same individual, asDr. C. supposed, 

 from their having been "found within a few feet of each other." The superior 

 fragment belonged to an older individual than the inferior one, as is indicated by 

 the condition of the teeth. They also differ in the character of their fossilization, 

 which would make one think they could hardly have been found so near to- 

 gether. The superior fragment has a white chalky aspect, is soft, rather friable, 

 and is readily cut with a pen-knife ; whilst the inferior fragment is hard, 

 compact, with a brown polished surface, and does not so readily yield to the 

 edge of the knife.

1849.] 181 



The superior fragment contains the three true molars and the last premolar. 

 The seventh, or most posterior molar, is fully protruded and well developed, and 

 the summits of its transverse eminences are worn sharp by trituration on their 

 anterior surface. The penultimate molar has the enamel of its transverse emi- 

 nences worn through, leaving two transverse irregularly outlined surfaces of ex- 

 posed dentine. The antepemiltimate molar, as usual in accordance with its 

 order of development, is smaller, and more worn than the premolar preceding 

 it. Its two transverse eminences are worn to their base, and the dentinal sur- 

 faces of each communicate by a narrow isthmus. The posterior premolar is but 

 a little more worn than the penultimate molar. In comparing these teeth with 

 those of two adult crania, of the recent Tapirus Americanus, in the Academy's 

 collection, I find that although they almost correspond in their antero-posterior 

 measurement, yet transversely they are somewhat larger, as may be observed 

 by the following table :

4th 95 85 



The malar process of the fossil fragment is considerably more elevated above 

 the margin of the alveoli than in the recent specimens ; thus in the former, from 

 the margin of enamel on the neck of the penultimate molar to the malar pro- 

 cess at its posterior part where it enters into the composition of the orbito- 

 temporal fossa, it measures 1.3 in., whilst in the latter, from corresponding 

 points, it measures only .65 in. In the former also, the process curves up- 

 wards and outwards, whilst in the latter it forms a curve outwards, moderate- 

 ly upwards and downwards. 



It also projects on a line posterior to the anterior transverse eminence. of the 

 last molar, and not at the dividing line between the sixth and seventh, as in 

 the recent crania. 



The floor of the orbit is considerably more elevated than in the recent speci- 

 mens, being 1.9 in. above the enamel margin upon the neck of the penultimate 

 molar; in the other being 1.1 in. only. 



The depth of the orbital fossa, as formed by the orbitar process of the max- 

 illary bone, has been the same in both the fossil and recent animal ; but the 

 outer edge in the former is elevated into a smooth rounded ridge, which either 

 formed the inferior edge of the orbit, or else bounded an external smooth groove 

 about two lines in depth and width, along the line of the maxillo-molar suture 

 in the recent cranium ; while in the latter, the edge of the orbit is formed by 

 the malar bone, and presents no groove internally along the sutures, except at 

 its anterior part, just external to the entrance of the infra-orbitar canal. The 

 malar articulating surface in the fossil, is therefore not only external to, but 




182 [June 



several lines below the external edge of the orbitar process of the maxillary 

 bono. This surface is also directed a little more outwards, as it proceeds 

 backwards, than in the recent crania. 



The line of the malar articulation would cause the head to appear somewhat 

 broader opposite the tempor;il fossje, and the elevation of the malar process, 

 and of the orbit, would probably make the posterior part of the face appear 

 higher in the fossil than in the recent animal. But the diffennces which I 

 have pointed out, especially the generally vertical increase of diameter of the 

 superior maxillary bone in the fossil specimen, may proliably ]•« <b'pendent 

 upon the advanced ago of the individual, and the excessive develojiuieiitof the 

 roots of the molars, which is a common occurrence in some animals, after the 

 body of the tooth has been nearly worn down, as in the horse, &c. 



The left half of the inferior maxilla has the condyle, all the margin of the 

 bone below and posterior to it, and the coronoid process, broken oflf. As ob- 

 served by Dr. C, it belonged to an individual "just attaining to adult age," 

 as is indicated by its being about to lose the last of the temporary teeth, to be 

 replaced by the third permanent premolar, which latter, in the spfcimen, is 

 exposed from the former having been broken away. The sixth molar, or last 

 true molar, is not wanting, as supposed by Dr. C, but has not yet protruded 

 from the jaw. The roots only of the canines exist in the specimen. The in- 

 cisors, except a fragment of the root of the right internal one, as well as the 

 exterior of the alveoli are broken away : traces only of the alveoli of the lateral 

 or most external incisors exist. I can observe no difference of character be- 

 tween the specimen and the recent jaw, except that the ridge occupying the 

 interspace between the first premolar, and the canine, is not so strongly 

 curved as in the latter, making them a very little, but to an unimportant de- 

 gree, farther apart. 



We have also in the collection of the Academy, the crown of a tooth of 

 Tapirus Americanus fossilis, deposited by Dr. M. W. Dickeson, and found by 

 him near Natchez, Mississippi. It is an inferior molar of the left side, appa- 

 rently the third temporary molar. Its transverse eminences are worn to their 

 base. Its proportions, and the fact of its being found associated with remains 

 of Equus Americanus, Mastodon, &c., are sufficient to justify the opinion that 

 it is fossil, and belonged to the same species as the inferior maxilla just 

 spoken of. 



Dr. Harlan, in his Fauna Americana,* has described the superior left molar 

 tooth of a Tapir found in Kentucky, which he ascribes to a new species under 

 the name of Tapirus mastodontoides. Upon comparing his description with 

 the fossil fragments, and the recent specimens, I think there are not distinctive 

 characters enough in it to distinguish it as a different species from the recent 

 one, for the greater obliquity of the transverse eminences of the crown, and 

 the slight variation in the form of the disks occasioned by attrition, appear to 

 me to be nothing more than individual peculiarities.

Description of a species of Eryx, from Madras. 



By Edward Hallowell, M. D. 



Eryx maculatus. 



Description. — Head of moderate size, depressed, covered with scales, larger in 

 front ; rostral plate large, triangular ; a single nasal plate on each side ; nostril 

 small ; thirteen labial plates margin the upper jaw ; pupil vertical, eye sur- 

 rounded by a circular series of plates ; iris brownish red ; neck of same size as 

 head posteriorly ; body thicker in the middle, becoming somewhat slender 

 towards the tail ; scales small, carinated ; a row of single plates uuderthe tail, 

 followed by others which are bifid ; tail short, truncate, (mutilated ?) 



Color. — Light brown above, with numerous spots of the same tint but darker ; 

 abdomen light slate color. 



Observations. — Tliis beautiful reptile was pointed out to me so long ago as 

 1840, by the late Dr. Harlan. It was brought from Madras, in the neighborhood 

 of which it was found upon a sandy soil. It appeared to be perfectly harmless. 

 The drawing was taken during life by Mr. Richard, and is remarkable for its 

 accuracy. The above short description is made up from it, the notes which were 

 written during its life having been mislaid. It, however, is so good that a de- 

 scription of any kind is almost unnecessary. The entire length was about one 

 foot and a half. I have long hesitated to publish a description of this animal, 

 coming as it does from a part of the Briti.-;h possessions so well known as Madras, 

 but hsving recently observed in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, 

 several species of reptiles described by Mr. Gray as new from the same locality, 

 not being found in the British Museum, and differing so entirely as it does from 

 any figure of Eryx hitherto published, I have ventured to present it to the Acad- 

 emy with the name I have given it.

The Committee on Dr. Keller's analysis of a calculus from the 



bladder of a Whale, reported ia favor of publication in the 

 Proceedings. 



Chemical Analysis of a Calculus frovi the bladder of a Whale. 

 By William Keller, M. D. 



Whalers report that it is not unusual to find a number of calculi in the bladder 

 of the whale. These calculi are about the size of a hen's egg, on the surface very 

 smooth, and of a white color. On breaking them they are seen to be formed of con- 

 centric layers, from the thickness of a sheet of paper to that of a quarter of an 

 inch; the chemical composition throughout being very nearly the same. Mr. Saul 

 Muller and myself took for analysis different layers, and found them of the same 

 composition. The chief constituent of the calculus is the double phosphate of 

 ammonia and magnesia. The quantity of ammonia could not be directly ascer- 

 tained, passing off at the summer temperature. But it will be seen that the 

 quantity of phosphate of magnesia found, will answer to the quantity of ammonia 

 and water found necessary for the formation of the double phosphate. 



The pulverized stone was first exposed to the heat of a water bath, to ascertain 

 the quantity of water; heated with ether and alcohol to find the quaatity of fat; then 

 dissolved in nitric acid, the residuum incinerated, the loss was organic matter and 

 uric acid, while the residuum was silicic acid. The quantity of magnesia was ascer- 

 tained as ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate, the phosphoric acid as phosphate of 

 iron. The carbonic acid, the quantity of which was very small, was found by 

 the apparatus of Will and Fresenius. The rest of the component parts were in 

 such small quantities that they could not be weighed : they were iron, lime, 

 chlorine and soda. The ammonia and water were ascertained by calculation.

 Dr. Bridges in the Chair. 

 The Chairman read the following letter addressed to him bj Dr. C. 

 D. Meigs, dated New Haven, Conaccticut, Aug. 4th, 1849, relating 

 some experiments which he made to ascertain the effects of deep-sea 

 pressure on the uterus of the Cetacea ; and which resulted in confirm- 

 ing the views which he expressed in his paper on this subject, publish- 

 ed in the last number of the Journal of the Academy, (New Serie« 

 Vol. 1, Part 3.) ^' 



" Yesterday, (May 3d,) I obtained permission to use the custom house boat, a 

 small sloop, to go out into the sound for the purpose of trying my experiment oa 

 the effect of sea-pressure on the uterus. 



I was fortunate in having as companion for the excursion, Mr. Theodore W. 

 Werner, of the Coast Survey, a gentleman who is occupied in this part of the 

 country, and was for a long time one of Mr. Haslar's assistants. I had a gum- 

 elastic bag, shaped very much like the uterus in question. It was fitted with a 

 smooth neck, or goulot, stopped with a velvet cork that fitted accurately. 



Mr. Werner was of opinion that the cork would not escape, but rather be 

 driven in ; in which he coincided with yourself and others. The wind being 

 light, we could not find water over 9J fathoms. 



Mr. Werner calculated that the pressure at 60 feet below the surface would be 

 over 1000 pounds. 



We threw the sloop in stays, and hove the dipsy overboard, which carried the 

 nterus to the bottom. It came up with the cork undisturbed ; a second and third 

 trial were followed by the same result. On the fourth trial, having inflated the 

 uterus, and adjusted the cork very lightly, it came up, having lost the stopper. 



Now, you will please observe, that the experiment was a very fair one, for as 

 the throat of the bottle was tied to the dipsy line, the cork necessarily looked 

 downwards, and if floated at all, it must float towards the throat of the bottle. 



I threw it over again, and by the time it reached the bottom, the cork wag 

 driven out with violence, and the whole of the air came rushing to the surface so 

 as to make me think, when I saw it coming from below, that a Dolphin was shoot- 

 ing upwards to the surface. 



Mr. Werner was very much gratified with the result, and I assure you I was 

 not less so; and I conclude that it justifies me in the rationale I have given of the 

 economical purpose of the double cervix of the Cetacean female."

Dr. Bridges in the Chair. 



The following letter from Mi.ss M. H. Morri.s, of Germautown, dated 

 July 2l8t, 1840, was read by the Correspondinfj Secretary. 



" I liiive delftyed proposing a name for the Ceci'lomyia, that feeds in tl'.e culm of 

 the wheat, because I wished ray communication to be accompanied by a complete 

 series of specimens from the egg to the perfect fly ; but eince 184.3, it has not 

 appeared in this neighborhood in sufficient number.s for me to trace it through 

 its several changes : I am therefore obliged to offer the name of C. mlmicola^ 

 as an appropriate one, ■with a brief history of its habits, as I have seen it, and 

 trust I may be more fortunate in future in procuring specimens for exami- 

 nation and description. 



The insect deposits its eggs early in June, on the grain, in or over the germ, 

 while the grain is in the soft or milky state. The eggs remain unhatched until 

 the grain germinates, but when the plant has grown about three or four inches, 

 the worm may be seen, with the aid of a strong magnifying glass, feeding above 

 the top joint, in the centre of the culm, where it remains until it has arrived at 

 maturity. Should this occur before the culm has become hard, the worm eats its 

 way through the joints, inside of the straw, and makes its escape at the root, 

 ascends the straw on the outside, where it attaches itself firmly, and awaits its 

 change ; the outer skin becomes thepuparium. In the pupa, or flax-seed state, 

 it closely resembles the C. destructor, and has heretofore been mistaken for that 

 species. 



Should the culm of the wheat become prematurely hard before the worm haa 

 finished feeding, as is often the case, the insect will remain imprisoned for life, 

 passing through its changes inside the straw, and there perish without the power 

 to escape, unless some accidental passage be made for it. I have liberated hun- 

 dreds with my pen knife, and thousands make their escape after the grain has 

 been reaped and carried into the barn. 



When the insect is thus unnaturally retarded, the time of its perfect develop- 

 ment is uncertain ; and I have found them on the straw, and in spiders, webs, in 

 and near a barn, from June until September. This destructive insect may there- 

 fore be carried in the straw from one country to another, as well as in the grain." 

 Letters were also read : 



From the Secretary of the Royal Academy of Sciences, of Brussels,

 ciety, announced this evening, and soliciting an exchange of publica- 

 tions, which was accordingly ordered.

From M. Fischer de Waldheim, dated Moscow, 1st May, 1849, ac-

Mr. Cass in called the attention of the Society to the specimen of Anas 

 Rafflesii, King, (Jard, and Selby, 111. Orn. n. s., pi. 23,) presented this evening 

 by E. Pilate, M. D., of Opelousas, La. This, Mr. C. stated, is the first instance 

 of the capture of this species within the limits of the United States, to the fauna 

 of which it is an addition of the highest interest. 



Dr. Pilate, who obtained the present specimen in the neighborhood of his 

 residence, represents it as the only one which has come under his observation. 

 To this gentleman, who is ardently devoted to the study of Ornithology, the 

 Academy is highly indebted for this valuable specimen.

The Committee to which was referred the paper of Dr, Savage, on 

 the Driver Ants of West Africa, reported in favor of its publication in 

 tbe Proceedings of the Academy, with some additional observations by 

 the Committee, suggested by the specimens sent by Dr. Savage with 

 the paper. 



The Driver Ants of Western Africa. 

 By Thomas S. Savage, M. D. 



These remarkable and interesting insects have been, till quit® recently, with- 

 out their place in our systems of Natural History. Occasional, but very im- 

 perfect notices have been given from time to time of Smeathman and Afzelius 

 to the present, of one or two annoying features in their economy ; but till now, 

 no regular description either of their entomological character or habits. 



In 1845, the author of this article, after a series of observations, sent, in com- 

 pliance with a promise, a detailed account of their habits, with numerous spe- 

 cimens, to J. 0. Westwood, Esq., Secretary of the Entomological Society of 

 London.* 



Mr. W. dissected with that minuteness and accuracy for which he is so re- 

 markable, individuals of the three classes into which they had been divided, 

 and published the results with illustrations, supplementary to the account, in 

 the Transactions of the Society. 



The insect in its perfect state had not then been discovered. Neuters with 

 larvse and pupse only were sent. The former only (neuters), it seems, arrived 

 in a state for examination. This is the more to be regretted, since, soon after 

 sending his account to London, the author left the locality for his health, with- 

 out the prospect of returning. 



* See Vol. 5, First Part, Transactions of London Entomological Society, for 

 remarks of Mr. W., and the account of the habits of the insects, more in detail. 




19G [Avo. 



The statement in the account that tho iuseot WAS without eyes, (/. e. tlie 

 neater,) was confirraod by Mr. Wustwood, whicli fact renders certain features 

 of their economy the more remarkable. 



Mr. Hliiickard t;ives, in tliu Aunal.s and Magazine of Natural Uistory, London, 

 a new species of the Formicidie, on wliich he founda the genus Auomma. T«> 

 tliis Mr. Westwood assigns the Driver of West Africa, and describes it as a new 

 species under the name of arcens, in allusion to the remarkable habit which 

 lias gained for it the significant name of Driver. 



Since his communication to the Entomological Society of London, the anther 

 has discovered a second species, which he denominates the Red Driver, a de- 

 scription of which follows that of the black species. 



Description. — Family Formicida (Leach) ; Genus Anomma (Shuckard).

Habitat in Africa occidentali tropicali. 



In Mus. Acad, et Nostr, 



The neuters of A. nt'/leta are less numerous than those of arcens, and, gen- 

 erally, of a smaller size. The mandibles are less falcate and pointed : their 

 habits the same. 



This species I discovered in the Mpongive District, a section of the west coast 

 on the banks of the Gaboon river, near the Equator. 



Habits — They are exceedingly ferocious. They have no permanent dwelling 

 place, but wander about in search of prey. Shallow cavities and crevices in 

 rocks, are adopted as their temporary habitations. The deepest cavity for this 

 purpose discovered, did not exeed two feet. The interior exhibits nomechani- 




1849.] 197 



cal contrivance for the depositing of food, or hatching of eggs ; for these pur- 

 poses, spaces between the stones, sticks, &c. found within, are adopted. 



This absence of mechanical arrangement in their dwellings accords well with 

 their known predaceous habits. 



Their sallies are usually made towards night, and in cloudy days. Should 

 they be detained abroad till late in the morning of a sunny day, they construct 

 for their protection against the heat, arches over their path, of earth, agglutinated 

 by a fluid secreted from their mouths. Should their course lie through thick 

 grass or projecting substances, the arch will be wanting, or more or less im- 

 perfect, depending on the degree of shelter thus afforded. 



That this arch is designed to protect them against the heat, may be inferred 

 from its absence in cloudy or rainy days. Such is their extreme sensitiveness, 

 that, when exposed to the direct rays of the sun, especially if the heat be in- 

 creased by reflection from surrounding surfaces, they expire in the space of two 

 minutes. Even with the arch, when far from their domicil, they will retire in the 

 middle of the day to the thick grass, and there regale themselves in the shade 

 till the decline of the sun, when their work is renewed with characteristic vigor. 



In migrating, protection is afforded to their pupse and young, by au arch con- 

 structed of the bodies of the larger class, or soldiers. Their mandibles and legs 

 are so curiously locked and intertwined, that a complete and formidable cover- 

 ing is presented ; at such times individual soldiers will be seen on the outside, 

 acting as guards and scouts, while others of the same class are within, appa- 

 rently performing the part of superintendents and commanders. In case of alarm 

 the arch is instantly broken, and the soldiers are seen running about in the most 

 confused and hurried manner, with their jaws extended and antennae working in 

 all directions, thus presenting a highly angry and ferocious aspect. Should the 

 alarm prove false, the victory be won, or danger passed, the arch is quickly re- 

 newed, the main column brought again to order, and their march resumed in all 

 the regularity of intellectual, military discipline. Their paths present a beaten 

 appearance, with freedom from all moveable obstructions. 



As to their relation sustained to the economy of the community, they may be 

 divided into three classes. It is the office of the first, or largest, which may be 

 called the soldiers, to defend the community, attack and disable the prey. Their 

 mandibles have long and slender points, well adapted to penetrate, and by their 

 strongly falcate shape, to hold fast the objects of attack. 



The second class frequently act as aids to the first, but their chief office evi- 

 dently is, to lacerate the prey and reduce it to a portable condition. Their 

 mandibles are flatter than those of the first, sharp, and have their teeth more 

 developed. 



The third are comparatively of very small size, and have their mandibles 

 developed in a manner similar to those of the second class. These sustain chiefly 

 the relation of carriers, and, perhaps, with the second class, maybe properly de- 

 nominated laborers. This diminutive size of the laborers is seen also among the 

 Termites, or White ants, while the soldiers are comparatively of gigantic form. 



There is occasionally an interchange of offices among these different classes, 

 as when an individual is found inadequate to accomplish his task ; but it is 

 very evident to an observer, that in general, they sustain the relatiou-lo the 

 community above described. 




198 [Aug. 



As soon as the prey is disabled, preparations bt-gln for its transportation. 

 While the class, whose duty it is, are lacerating the flesh, and reducing it to a 

 state proper for removal, others are engaged in clearing a path between the 

 locality and their domicil ; the whole under the conduct of inilividuals of the 

 first class. 



This stage of their operations is intensely interesting to the obst.'rv»-r. The 

 facility and rapidity with which these little creatures, without the aid oi eyes, 

 overcome mountain obstacles, is surprising beyond expression ; the gn-ater the 

 difficulty, the greater their effort and perseverance. One is seen dragging along 

 a straw or stick many times his own length and size ; another gra-sjiing, rolling, 

 then pushing along a stone far exceeding his own weight and bulk, and when 

 his own power is not sufficient, calling in the aid of others, each knowing that 

 a work is to be done, none idle, and every one doing promptly his part. At first, 

 in the preparatory stage, there is apparently considerable confusion, the 'liffer- 

 ent classes commingled, running backwards and forwards, and many missing 

 the direct way to their domicil. But soon the soldiers are seen moving about 

 with great activity, evidently bringing the lines into order. After a while they 

 arrange themselves at different distances, on both sides of the path. The labor- 

 ers are then kept within, in two nearly right lines, one going and the other re- 

 turning ; while on the outside are guards and scouts, intent upon the ajiproach 

 of danger, and ready to give alarm. 

 The pupae and prey are carried longitudinally under their body. 

 Their bite is severe, and differs from that of the soldiers among the Termite^. 

 The latter work their mandibles, which are fiat, in a cross direction, like scis- 

 sors. The former, with mandibles falcate, round and pointed, work them alter- 

 nately from side to side, penetrating deeper at each stroke, till they meet beneath 

 the flesh. So tenacious is their hold, that frequently it is broken only by a 

 separation of the head from the body, and even, then the head will often con- 

 tinue to work its jaws beneath the flesh with undiminished force. 



The degree of sagacity manifested by this insect in time of difficulty is very 

 great. On one occasion, having been driven from their domicil by the applica- 

 tion of fire, they congregated in vast numbers around and on the body of a neigh- 

 boring tree. From the lower limbs, about four feet high, hung several chains 

 or festoons of these insects, their jaws locked .ind their legs twined, one with 

 another, till they reached the ground. One of these chains, on my arrival, was 

 in the act of completion. Ant after ant descended gradually, lengthening it out 

 till it reached the broad leaf of a plant (Canna coccinea) below. It then swung 

 to and fro, in a breeze blowing strongly from the sea, which rendered it diffi- 

 cult for the terminal ant to secure his hold, and thus complete the desired com. 

 munication. After a few unsuccessful trials, another ant of the same class (the 

 soldiers) ascended the plant, and taking his stand on the leaf directly under the 

 vibrating column, fixed his hind claws in the leaf, and raising his body on the 

 apex of his abdomen, reached forth his fore legs, opened wide his jaws, and closed 

 in with his fellow from above, thus completing the most curious ladder in the 

 world. Another fact of great interest : should a stream of water of small ex- 

 tent, intercept their course, they will compass it, but if this be difficult, they 

 will throw across a bridge of their own bodies, over wliich the main column 

 marches with freedom and safety. 

 Another habit of equal interest may be here stated. A like assertion has been 




1849.] 199 



made of another species of South American Formicidae, but doubted by some 

 " in-door" naturalist or compiler. 



The seasons in West Africa are divided into "wet" and " dry," each making 

 up about half of the year. During the former, violent and continued rains often 

 occur, which, either directly, or from the rapid rise of the river, cause an over- 

 flow of the low grounds. As the Drivers delight in rather low situations, usual- 

 ly little above the base of hills, they are often exposed to inundations. In such 

 emergency, they leave their domicils, throw themselves into a rounded mass, 

 deposit their eggs, &c. in the centre, and thus float on the water, till a place of 

 safety is reached, or the flood subsides. Even in situations beyond this over- 

 flow, so copious and incessant are the rains at tiii.es, that they must be deluged 

 for days in their nests. Under such circumstances, one would suppose that 

 they would perish. Many undoubtedly do, for all communities of animal exist- 

 ences are exposed to casualties. But in this case, as throughout the kingdom of 

 nature, God has most graciously established a system of compensation, illus- 

 trating at once the minuteness of his Providence and his benevolence. As he 

 has endowed this insect with a high degree of vitality, so has he given to it 

 great tenacity of life and powers of endurance. 



Individuals submerged in water have lived more than 24 hours ; and when 

 decapitated, 48 hours I The head separated from the body will bite for several 

 hours after, apparently with as much force as when in all its natural connections. 



They are decidedly aggressive in their habits. The dread of them rests upon 

 every living thing. It is a statement literally true, that " they drive everything 

 before them, capable of motion." Their entrauce into dwellings is known by 

 the simultaneous movement of rats, mice, lizards, roaches, &c. &c. with which 

 they may be infested. Even man, styled " Lord of ^creation," bows to this, a 

 more numerous foe; for let the Drivers enter one door and he quickly escapes at 

 the other. 



So intense is the bite by accumulation, that the largest animal, if confined, is 

 overpowered and destroyed. The dread with which all animals are inspired, 

 of this diminutive creature, may be inferred from the statement universally made 

 by the natives on the coast, respecting their largest serpent, the Python natalen- 

 sis. After disabling its prey by the fearful process of constriction, the Python, 

 it is said, makes a wide sweep in the vicinity, to see if the Drivers are near ; 

 should they not be, he returns to the work of engorgement, but if near, he aban- 

 dons his prey to their more numerous jaws. 



Donkeys, on coming to them, crossing the road, will suddenly turn, and 

 throw their rider to one side, and if urged onward willgivealeapfar over the line. 



Dogs, rather than run the risk of a leap, will compass their track by going a 

 long distance round. 



The smaller snakes, lizards, &c., are disabled very soon after the attack. 

 This easy victory seems to be accomplished by an early destruction of vision. 

 The mandibles of the Drivers being long and sharp-pointed, penetrate with great 

 ease the membranes of the eye. Domestic animals being generally confined at 

 night, are often destroyed by them. 



When they enter a dwelling their movements are characterized with a good 

 degree of order. If they discover prey, they congregate upon it in vast num- 

 bers, when they may be easily destroyed by boiling water. ' 



Their ascent into beds may be prevented by putting the feet of the bedsteads 

 into vessels of vinegar, or some other uncongenial fluid. This will be successful 




200 [^ua. 



if the rooms be ceiled, otherwise tbej will drop from above, bringing along with 

 them their noxious prey in the act of contending for victory. 



For food they prefer fresh animal, or insectul matter. Tlic larvaj of other 

 iniects, and the young of all animals, are obnoxious t^ them, hence all heaps of 

 rubbish, and hiding places of such prey, when occurring in their route, are care- 

 fully explored. Hence, too, the Drivers, when returning from their predatory 

 excursions, afford some of the rarest and linest of the smaller specimens of Ento- 

 mology. 



Newly expressed oils are also favorite articles of food, especially the vegetable, 

 that obtained from the fruit of the Elais guiniensis— the I'alm oil of commerce. 



The Drivers, though often a great annoyance, are not without their uses in the 

 economy of nature. They tend to keep down the rapid increase of noxious in- 

 sects and smaller reptiles. They consume much dead animal and vegetable 

 matter, which, constantly occurring in tropical climates, vitiates the atmosphere ; 

 and, which is not the least important, they compel the inhabitants to observe 

 habits of comparative cleanliness in their dwellings and on their i.remises, as a 

 filthy town or house is the sure object of frequent visits. 



The natives of Africa dread their approach, for being almost naked, wearing 

 a narrow piece of cotton around their loins only, they are the more exposed 

 to their bites ; but more especially, say they, " because they deprive us of two 

 things we love most, poultry and sleep. 



On the identity of Anomma with Dorylus, iuggested by specimens which Dr. 



Savage found together, and transmitted to illustrate his paper on the Driver 



Ants. By the Committee to which it was referred. 



In the letter transmitting his paper on the Driver ants to the Academy, Dr. 

 Savage says, " In the small vial you will find specimens o( rubella, with three 

 very large individuals, which I consider the perfect insect. Now here is pre- 

 sented an interesting point of investigation, viz., the true relation of these larger 

 individuals to the Driver ants." These specimens afford a solution to a prob- 

 blem which has engaged the attention of entomologists; namely, the relation of 

 the Dorylides to the Formicidse, since the large ones alluded to belong to the 

 genus Dorylus. They are 13 lines long, and seem to be referrible to D. nigri- 

 cans, and they had cast their wings. There is little to indicate an identity of 

 Si'ccies between them and rubella, as these want the holosericeous surfaces. The 

 color and texture of the head and mandibles agree, however, and the medial 

 and posterior coxae present a narrow excavation superiorly (for the reception of 

 the femora when elevated,) in place of the conspicuous cup-shaped one in the 

 corresponding limbs of the male. The mandibles in this sex are slender and 

 have the apex incurved, but not falcate, and they are without teeth. The fe- 

 mora are extremely compressed, and the abdominal peduncle is about as wide 

 as the succeeding segment. 



There are two forms, both of arcens and rubella, one of which includes the 

 largest individuals, the mandibles of which are armed with one abrupt, erect 

 medial tooth ; the other and more abundant form is variable in size, and the 

 m.indibles have tico slender teeth directed forwards. The labial organs and 

 maxillae are alike in both forms of both species. These organs cannot be com- 

 pared in 'Dorylus,' because, with the mouth, they are entirely wanting: the 

 margins of the labium and labrum being solidly united. 




1849.] 201 



The circumstances attending the capture of these insects are thus stated hy 

 Dr. Savage. 



"In the month of April, 1847, 1 visited the mission of the Am. Board Com. For • 

 Miss., at Gaboon, 15' north of the equator. Walking out at 7 o'clock on a cloudy 

 morning, I saw a column of red drivers crossing the path. They consisted of 

 two lines, as is always the case, one going, the other returning to their domicil. 

 I stopped some time to compare them with the black species which abounds at 

 Cape Palmas and that part of the west coast generally. They were not as nu- 

 merous nor as large as arcens, but equally ferocious and offensive. Their ar- 

 rangements and movements were the same. I soon discovered within the lines 

 the large insects in question. I was here taken by surprise, as I had observed 

 nothing like them in the economy of the Black drivers. The first idea present- 

 ed to my mind was, that they were captives, but on observing further, they 

 seemed to be no unimportant members of the community. Within a distance 

 of about two rods I discovered ten of this class. I was soon convinced that 

 they belonged to the drivers, and proceeded to test the truth of the conclusion- 

 I took one or two from the lines to a distance of six and ten feet. They seemed 

 at once to miss their companions, and manifested great trepidation, and made 

 continuous efibrts to find a way of return. At last they reached the lines and' 

 instantly resumed their places, displaying at the same time decided gratifica- 

 tion. Nor were the lines thrown into any confusion by their entrance, as they 

 would most surely have been in case of a foreign insect or body. On further 

 watching their motions, I perceived that they did not continue on with the 

 drivers, but after going a certain distance returned. This they repeated, going 

 and returning. Wliat office they performed I could not discover. My time 

 was limited, not permitting me to trace them to their domicil. It was with 

 regret that I left them ; but from the observations made, it was evident that 

 they were members of the driver community. I cannot doubt that they are the 

 perfect state of the insect. Several natives recognized them as insects that flew 

 about, and into their houses at night. This is altogether probable when they 

 first attain their Avinged state. Similar insects closely allied to Dorylus, it is 

 known, fly at night into houses at Cape Palmas, undoubtedly bearing the 

 same relation to arcens or the Black driver." 



The facts here stated are sufficient evidence that Anomma Shuckhard 1840, is 

 another condition of Dorylus Latr. 1802, which must take its place among the 

 Formic-idae, agreeably to the views of St. Fargeau. For the sake of convenient 

 reference, we may, with Dr. Savage, regard the larger form of the drivers 

 (Anomma) as soldiers, the intermediate ones as workers, and the smallest as 

 carriers. 



In the same manner, Shuckhard's view of the identity of Typhlopone with 

 Labidus is rendered probable, which would require the latter to be placed in 

 the Formic-idse, to which Mr. Westwood has shown that Typhlopone belongs. 

 Thus not only will Anomma and Typhlopone be superseded, but the supposed 

 family of the Dorylidse will be suppressed.* 



*Typhlopone pallipes Hald., 1844, Proceed. Acad. 2, 54, does not belong to 

 this genus, but rather to Amblyopone Er., Arch. Naturg., 1842, p. 260, pi. 5, 

 fig. 7: with the characters of which it agrees, except that the mandibles are 

 toothed from end to end, and the antennae are 12-articulate, instead of 11 as 

 required by his text, although his figure represents 12. The eyes are visible, 

 although small and indistinct. 




202 



[Aug. 



The chief question romaining to bo dtsposfld of relates to the female. The 

 thorax of tlie .soliliers i)rt.'sc'ut.4 no olwt^rvabl^ alar cicatrices, ami as they are 

 anomalous in thoir small Hize when compared with the male Dorylus, we must 

 search for the normal female in somu large unrecognized form. 



The specimens named rubella, although distinct from arceru, resemble it very 

 closely, even to the details of the oral organs. The form of the labium, as de- 

 termined by a careful dissection, does not agree with Mr. Westwood's figure. 

 His representation of the maxillae (in which he has omitted the mando and galea) 

 is more accurate. Both species have a posterior lateral spine on the thorax, 

 and a compressed sharp spine directed backwards and placed along the middle 

 of the abdominal peduncle, which has also a small lateral tubercle. In rubella 

 the sternum is carinated, and has a spine upon each side of the carina, between 

 the medial coxaj. The head is rather less contracted posteriorly than in arceru. 

 The general similarity is sufficiently great to make the two species congeneric ; 

 and if Dorylus nigricans is taken as the male of rub'lla, it will be difficult to 

 assign a male to arcens from among the described species of Dorylus. The ab- 

 dominal peduncle of arcens is slightly smaller than in rubella, whilst the insect 

 is rather larger, so that a Dorylus with a small peduncle may be the correspond- 

 ing male : and among these D. glabratus Shk. might be chosen, as it is larger 

 than nigricans. There is, however, too much discrepancy in the color to admit 

 such a conclusion without hesitation, arcetis being black. We are, therefore, 

 inclined to regard Dorylus arcens as a black species with a large peduncle, yet 

 to be discovered as a male. The last character is possessed by D. planiceps 

 Hald., which, although taken at Cape Palmas by Dr. Savage, is too small to 

 correspond with arcens, and its color is lighter than in nigricans. 



Dr. Goheen brought specimens of rubella from Monrovia, a locality 1500 

 miles distant from that specified by Dr. Savage.

nicatiun on tlie " Wheat Midge " of Nova Scotia, reported in favor of

Notices of specimens of the Wheat Midge from Nova Scotia. 

 By J. W. Dawson. 



This destructive little creature lias, within the last four or five yoftrs, extended 

 its ravfif,'e3 to Nova Scotia. It made its appearance first iu the westeru counties, 

 and has gradually extended its limits eastward. It is now found in every part 

 of the Province, and has, in some district?-, caused an almost total abandonment 

 of wheat culture. The specimens accompanying this notice, were reared from 

 the larva state; and as I believe this has not often been attempted with success, 

 I shall shortly state the means by which they were obtained. 



When I first became acquainted with this insect, I procured specimens of the 

 full grown larva; and placed them in a phial, with the view of observing their 

 assumption of the perfect state in spring. None of them, however, appeared, 

 and I subsequently learned that similar experiments had been tried without suc- 

 cess ; the belief among entomologists being, that the larva descends into the 

 ground to complete its changes. I could not, however, ascertain that this be- 

 lief had been confirmed by actual experiment or observation. 



To satisfy myself on this point, (obviously of importance in reference to the 

 means which may be devised for destroying these animals,) I obtained a fresh 

 supply of the larvie in that motionless and apparently torpid state in which they 

 are found in the ripe wheat in autumn. In the month of November, a few dozens of 

 these larvae were placed on the surface of moist soil in a flower pot, in which a 

 carnation was growing. In the course of two days they had, with the exception 

 of a few which were crushed or otherwise injured, descended into the ground, 

 leaving their delicate membranous cases on the surface. Their power of burrow- 

 ing having been thus ascertained, they were allowed to remain undisturbed du- 

 ing winter, the spot where they had disappeared being covered with a glass 

 shade. During winter the flower pot was watered as the growth of the carna- 

 tion required. 



A similar experiment having been tried in another pot, the insects were sought 

 for in the ground after their disappearance. Very few were found, and these had 

 still the larva form. They were, however, most flexible, and showed some de- 

 gree of activity. On being placed on the surface, they endeavored to burrow, 

 by means of a worm-like motion, and in doing so they seemed to have the power 

 of fi.xing the anterior j^art of the body pretty firmly to the soil. They were 

 found to have penetrated to the depth of about an inch. It thus appeared that 

 the stiffness and torpidity of the larvae in the ripe grain, are but temporary, and 

 that when they fall from their place within the chaff scales, upon the moist 

 ground, and cast their skins, they acquire the activity and strength necessary 

 for penetrating into the soil, while still in the larva form. 



The insects were not again seen until the last week in June, when they began 

 to appear in the imago state, and as early as the tenth of July the whole had 

 emerged. At that date there was no wheat in blossom in this vicinity, but the 

 development of the insects had probably been hastened by the warmth and shelter 

 of the house. The emergence of the midges appeared to take place in the eve- 




1849.] 211 



ning, but was not actually observed. After they had taken wing, their pupa 

 cases remained projecting from the ground, and were white and membranous. 

 When examined by the microscope, they showed the true chrysalis form, the 

 wings and other external organs being distinctly marked on them. 



The remainder of the larvae procured in autumn having been kept dry in a 

 paper box, have lost their orange color, and appear to be quite dead, moisture 

 being apparently absolutely necessary to their entering on the pupa stage. 



The insects obtained in the above described manner, were of both sexes. The 

 females agree in their characters with the figures and descriptions of the European 

 Cecidomyia Tritici.* The males, which I have not seen figured or described, 

 are distinguished by their smaller size, differently formed abdomen, and longer 

 and more hairy antennae. 



I am not aware whether the mode of hybernation of the wheat midge or 

 " weevil." is generally known to farmers in the United States. If not, it is well 

 worthy of attention, since, by cutting the wheat early, and carefully collecting 

 the larvae contained in the chaff, and dust separated from the grain, a large pro- 

 portion of the ensuing year's brood may be destroyed. On the other hand, if the 

 larvae be allowed to be scattered over the fields or barn-yard, a plentiful supply 

 of "weevils " for the next crop is secured. This method was proposed several 

 years since by Prof. Henslow, but I have not been able to ascertain whether it 

 has been used extensively in America. 



The Committee on the following paper, by Dr. Savage, reported in 

 favor of publication in the Proceedings : 



Observations on the species of Termitidce of West Africa, described by Smeathman 

 as Termes hellicosus, and by Linnceus as T. fatalis. 



By T. S. Savage. 



Having read a condensed account and many extracts from the communication 

 of Dr. Smeathman to the Philosophical Society of London, on the insect in ques- 

 tion, it seemed to me that no room was left for the discovery of additional facts. 

 But, residing in the locality of the Termes, I felt a desire to know personally' 

 their economy ; first, from motives of interest in the general subject of Natural 

 History ; and secondly, in order to discover someway of preventing their sup- 

 posed attacks on our buildings. 



As I proceeded, I noticed some mistakes made by Dr. S., or his many copiers 

 which induced me to record my own observations. Of these the following is a 

 summary. 



I would here remark, that I have never seen the original nor entire publication 

 of Dr. Smeathman's paper ; but, what I have seen, is sufficient to show that he 

 was an acute observer, a man of indomitable perseverance, and accurate to a re- 

 markable degree. The best account that I have read of his paper, is that of 

 Edward Newman, Esq., F. R. S., in his " Familiar Introduction to the History 

 of Insects." It is free from the marks of a prurient imagination, and indicates 



* Curtis, Journ. of Agric. Society, England. 




212 [Sept. 



more of a desire to relate the simple truth in the historj of the insect, than any 

 that I have seen. The figures, however, which stand at the head of his account, 

 are decidedly bad. 



The first thing that strikes a visitor who is familiar with Adamson's and 

 Smeathman's observations, when he arrives on the coast of Africa, is the great 

 Bparseness of the Termites' hills. Instead of " acres so thickly covered, as to 

 appear like the huts of native settlements," his eye may wander over acres mlh- 

 out teeing one ; one cause of this sparseness may have arisen to some extent, 

 from the introduction of civilization. The visitor usually lands first at the Eu- 

 ropean or American settlement, where the hills in their immediate vicinity are 

 mostly destroyed. This has been done, first, from the notion that the insect 

 "ate down their dwellings;" and, secondly, from the superiority of the clay of 

 •which they are constructed, which is used for building purposes. At no point, 

 however, between Cape Verd and the Gaboon river, will the stranger remark 

 them for their numbers. 



They more frequently occur on plane and flat lands ; making their appearance 

 especially soon after the lands have been cleared for planting, at which time trees 

 are left girdled and prostrate to decay. 



The features which first strike the beholder are their great size and form. 

 These have been well represented by Smeathman, though two hills cannot be 

 found exactly alike. Their contour is generally that of a hay-stack — the surface 

 never regular, always marked with protuberances and upward projections, often 

 not unlike " turrets," as termed by Smeathman. 



Sometimes the hill presents the aspect of a mound having been worn down by 

 the heavy rains, or, if in the vicinity of a village, by children playing upon it- 

 In such cases they may be forsaken. 



When they present distinct upward projections, or turrets, they are known to 

 be in the process of enlargement. This is always the mode in which these in- 

 sects increase their domicils. Turrets are projected one after another, and the 

 intervening space filled out, so as to make a continuous surface. Within each of 

 these turrets is a cavity -which leads down as a passage, into the interior of the 

 hill or terminates in some other passage, keeping up a free communication 

 throughout the structure. When hills present in their general outline the form 

 of a hay stack, they have arrived at their maximum size. Their height in such 

 cases is from 12 to 15 feet perpendicular measurement, the circumference at 

 base from 50 to 60 feet ; at two-thirds the height, or around the base of the 

 " dome," from 30 to 40 feet. 



The materials have for their base clay generally strongly tinged with oxide of 

 iron in the recent state ; after exposure to the sun and atmosphere, it takes on a 

 liffht color, approaching a dull yellow, in some cases white. There is an ad- 

 mixture, more or less, of other subtances incidentally occurring, as gravel, 

 lea-jes, straw, &c. 



Sometimes the clay presents a dark, slaty aspect, which is incorrectly stated 

 in books to be an indication of a different species of insects. This fact is owing 

 to different colored clays, existing in different localities. 



The strength of these structures is incalculably great; as an evidence of this, 

 Smeathman states that they are often mounted by wild bulls, and four men were 

 known to stand on one to spy a vessel at sea. But more than this, they would 




1849.J 213 



sustain more wild bulls and men than could possibly viount them. The particles 

 of clay are cemented together by a fluid excreted from the mouth of the insect 

 (aot as Smeathman says, by gums elaborated from the different kinds of wood 

 on which they feed). This, by exposure to the sun and atmosphere, becomes 

 exceedingly hard and tenacious on the surface, added to which, the action of the 

 well known principle in mechanical philosophy involv^ed in the arched form of 

 the structure, gives to it a vast degree of strength. This feature in the economy 

 of the Termes fatalis — the strength of the domiciles — is a wise provision in na- 

 ture. It guards the hills against the heavy, wasting rains of the country, and 

 enables them to resist the shock of decayed falling trees, which so often occur 

 on recently cleared grounds. When it is known that it is the practice of the 

 natives of Africa not to plant the same piece of ground two years in succession, 

 but let it lie fallow four or five years, and clear up a new spot every year, and 

 as many trees are girdled and left to decay and fall, the wisdom of this feature 

 will be understood. 



On clearing away the shrubbery and grass around the base of a hill, several 

 covered ways or clay tubes will be seen leading to neighboring stumps and 

 decayed logs. These tubes, sometimes 12 inches in diameter at base, gradually 

 diminish, ramifying, as they proceed outward. If their connection with the hill 

 be broken, as many holes will be seen, constituting mouths of passages which 

 run in a sloping direction to a depth of 12 or 18 inches under the domicil. These 

 passages expand into basement rooms, bounded by clay pillars, supporting a 

 series of arch-work on which rest the "cellular work," "royal apartments," 

 and super-incumbent interior portions of the structure. 



The exterior of the hill consists of a clay wall varying in thickness on the 

 different sides from 6 inches to IJ feet. Throughout this wall there are cavities, 

 cells and passages, anastamosing and running from the base to the apex, form- 

 ing a communication with the " dome." Within, at the base, elevated to a 

 height of one to two feet above the surf ace of the ground, and central in respect to 

 the circumference of the hill, is the apartment of the king and queen, styled by 

 Smeathman "the royal chamber," surrounded bj many other apartments or 

 chambers, containing eggs and young of various sizes and stages of growth, all 

 supported by the arch-work mentioned. 



It will be observed, that Mr. Smeathman states that the " royal apartments " 

 are on a level with the surface of the ground ; but, in every case,l have found 

 them elevated from one to two feet, depending on the height of the structure. 

 Indeed, at certain seasons, this elevation becomes a matter of necessity in many 

 localities. Were it otherwise, the royal pair would be in danger of inundation 

 during the long and violent rains of that country. 



Immediately above the royal apartments, extending across and up the sides of 

 the hill, to about two-thirds their height, are the "nurseries " of Smeathman, 

 a yellow, dry, comb-like, granulated substance, enclosed in moist red claj-, so 

 moist that it can be made by the hands into balls. In this substance are nume- 

 rous narrow serpentine cavities, or cells, containing eggs and young in difterent 

 stages. Scattered on the surface are perceived, in a recent state, many minute 

 white globular fungi. Immediately above, and interior to the nurseries, lie the- 

 " magazines " of Smeathman, rising to the height of about a foot. These are a 

 cellular arrangement of soft clay, filled with a dark-brown granulated substance, 




214 [Ski'T. 



flupjioscd by Mr. F. to be the " food."' It is very moist, and ai)iiPiirB to be vege- 

 table substnncc, coniniinuted and reduced to this state by the insect. 



Between the royal apartments and nurseries, is the first floor of Smeathman : 

 immediately above the magazines, is the sccontJ, then comes the " dome,"alarge 

 cavity in the upper part of the structure. With the dome there is a communica- 

 tion by numerous passages with the different parts of the hill, and thus a free 

 circulation of warm air kept up, giving a uniform temperature to the domicil. 

 The principles of philosophy known in the tendency of air to an oquilibrinm, its 

 ascent when rarified, condensation and descent in coming in contact with a 

 colder medium, thus securing a uniformity of temperature, are all involved in 

 this peculiarity of structure. 



The statement of Dr. Smeathman respecting the primary size and subsequent 

 mode of increase of the royal apartments, is a matter of deduction, though un- 

 doubtedly correct. In small hills the queen is found of corresponding size. Aa 

 the hills increase, the size of the queen and her apartments are known to in- 

 crease. The adjacent portions must be taken down to meet this enlargement. 

 This is true also of other portions of the structure. As the outer projections, or 

 turrets, are sent up from within, and the intervening spaces filled out, a portion 

 of what was previously the exterior, must be removed to admit of the expansioQ 

 of the interior arrangements, the nurseries, magazines, &c. This change and 

 removal must be more cr less true also, of almost all parts of the domicil. 



The community was divided by Smeathman into three orders ; 1st, the workers, 

 2d, soldiers; 3d, the perfect insects, male and female-, or king and queen ; a fourth 

 order, or state was subsequently noticed by Latreille among other species in 

 the south of France, at Bordeaux,(Termes lucifigus.) It was afterwards observed 

 in the East Indies, and incidentally noticed by an anonymous writer in manu- 

 script on a Ceylonese species (Kirby and Spence's Introduct., 2d vol. 33 p.) 

 This was the nympha or pupa state of the workers in which rudimental wings 

 were observed. The same state was inferred and averred of T. fatalis, by Messrs. 

 Kirby and Spence, and adopted by compilers. I have never known this inference 

 to be confirmed by any observer, writing on the African species; but, I am 

 happy in being able to assert the fact from personal observation, and, further- 

 more, to declare the sa7?ie of the soldiem, I have seen both with rudimental 

 wings distinct. Messrs. Kirby and Spence suppose the pupre to be equally ac- 

 tive with their respective larvoj, which is not the case ; they are exceedingly 

 delicate and sluggish. 



Of these several orders, the laborers are by far the most numerous. They 

 seem to be susceptible of two divisions — larger and smaller laborers. The latter 

 exceed the former in numbers, and are found chiefly in the domicil. The work 

 about the hill, such as constructing, repairing, bearing away the eggs from the 

 maternal department, &c.. seems to be done by them. Of the larger size, some 

 few are found in the hill, but they exist in greater numbers in the covered ways, 

 about and in the objects of plunder. The mandibles of this division are very 

 hard and strong, and admirably adapted to the performance of what I suppose to 

 be their part in the community, which is the comminuting of the different kinds 

 of wood on which they prey, and the reducing of the clay from which their hills 

 are made, to a portable,condition. A like division of labor I have noticed among 

 the Driver ants of Africa, (Anomma arcens, and A. rubella); Messrs. Kirby and 

 Spence are incorrect when they say (Introduct., 2d vol., p. 40-41.) that " they 




1849.] 215 



carry in their mouths a mass of mortar half as big as their bodies, ready tempered, 

 made of the finer parts of gravel, which, worked up to a proper consistence, 

 hardens to a substance resembling stone, of which their nests are constructed." 

 The amount each insect carries at a time, is so small as to be hardly perceptible 

 to the naked eye. When the work is done, it presents a minutely granulated 

 appearance, like that of the " nurseries." Nor is it already " tempered," ready 

 to be laid. The insect, when it arrives at the place of deposit, stops for an 

 instant, and retaining his hold on the piece of clay, undergoes a slight tremulous 

 movement, more perhaps like the spasmodic action of vomiting, when a fluid 

 being seen to be excreted from the mouth over it, the clay is deposited. This cor- 

 rects the supposition of Smeathman, that the cementing medium was gum obtain- 

 ed from the trees on which they preyed. The outer surface of the work, when 

 recent, presents a red, moist, granulated appearance, but when acted on by the 

 sun and atmosphere, it approaches a dull white, or yellow, and is highly indura- 

 ted, more so than simple clay dried in the sun can be. It however, falls far 

 short of the hardness of stone; as the hill is penetrated, the clay becomes softer 

 until the interior is found to be so plastic that it can be made into balls under 

 the pressure of the hand. The young of this order are seen of all sizes : the 

 nymphcB of Latreille differing from the others apparently in no respect but that 

 of their rudimentary wings. 



Soldiers. — Of this order, there seems to be ground for two divisions also, 

 larger and smaller. 



When a breach is made in the hill, the smaller soldiers are seen with the labor- 

 ers in small numbers, and retreat with them to the interior. Then appear the 

 larger soldiers, whose duty especially it is to defend the community. Their con- 

 duct, ferocious aspect, &c., have been well described by Smeathman, and need 

 not be here repeated. It has been said, however, whether by Mr. S. or not, I 

 cannot state, that in the act of biting, " they never quit their hold even though 

 they are pulled limb from limb," (Kirby and Spence, Introduct., vol. 2, p. 40.) 



This assertion has been correctly made of the Driver ants of Africa, (Anomma 

 arcens and A. rubella,) but cannot be of the Termes fatalis. It is the habit of 

 this insect to let go immediately after biting, and strike as fiercely at another 

 place, doing this several times in quick succession. The manner in which its 

 jaws operate, will not admit of a continued hold. Like scisson-', (unlike the 

 mandibles of the Anomma,) they cross each other, separating the fibres by a 

 clear cut through. 



In about fifteen minutes after the attack of the enemy, the work of reparation 

 begins by the laborers, who, accompanied by a few of the smaller soldiers, and 

 occasionally a larger, appear in great numbers. In view of the duty performed 

 by these two orders, it is a surprising fact that both malts and females are 

 without eyes. 



These at particular seasons, leave the hills in vast numbers. "The rains," 

 as they are familiarly termed in Africa, begin in May, sooner or later, and continue 

 with some intermissions until October. During the month of July, nnd sometimes 

 extending into August, an inteimission takes place under the name of "middle 

 dried," dividing them into " early and latter rains." At the beginning of these 

 seasons — " early and latter rains," — the Termes swarm (if it may be so called.) 

 in incalculable numbers. At their exit, so rapid is their ascent, that they present 

 the appearance of smoke rising from all parts of the hill. The holes through 




216 [Sept. 



wliicli they cscnpe, nrc tcmponirj, created fortius purpose, and closed wIko the 

 swarminif conses. During this i)roco8s, the fttmosjiheie for many rods distant 

 seems lo he filled with them. Birds are then seen whirling and darting through 

 the air in (luick pursuit — all orders of insect-eating animals, are now on the alert. 

 Barn yard fowls are seen to jump up several feet from the ground to catch them 

 as they descend. Indeed, men as well as brutes, make them th«ir prey. All 

 tribes of Africans, however, do not eat them. The Grebos, who inhabit Cape 

 Palmas, and among whom these observations were made, reject them as food. 

 Why, it is difficult to tell, unless it be from the trouble attending their capture- 

 It is not from any fastidiousness of taste, for they are known to eat snakes, 

 toads, grubs, beetles, and even putrid meat, with zest. Tribes about fifty 

 miles to the windward of Cape Palmas, use them as food. To catch them, bowls 

 of water are set on the ground, into which they fall as their wings drop off. 

 They are then roasted as shrimps, and the larger beetle (goliathi)aresaid to be 

 equally sweet. 



The individuals of the two sexes appear to be about the same size when they 

 issue from the hill, not exceeding half an inch. The largest queen I have ever 

 seen at the head of a community measured A\ inches in length. 



Messrs. Kirby and Spence state that the queen lives but two years, which is 

 incorrect. I have observed the yearly increase of hills ior five years or more, 

 and, when dissected, they have yielded a queen of corresponding size. To say 

 that a successor to the original one might have been elected, would be gratui- 

 tous. Nothing is known of their habits to warrant such an assertion, while 

 everything we do know goes to prove thai they live for many years. 



It is stated also, that but one queen is ever found in a hill. This, too, is in- 

 correct. But one is generally found. I have known two to occur. They were 

 contained in the same structure, called by Smeathmaa " the royal chamber," but 

 separated by a septum of clay. The hill was of the usual size. It was " dug 

 down" by a colonist at Cape Palmas, who, knowing that I was investigating the 

 habits of the insect, kindly brought them to my residence. I regretted exceed- 

 ingly my inability to decide the question which arose to ray mind at first sight, 

 " Is it a case of bigamy ?" The person who discovered them took no notice, and 

 was unable to say that he saw even one king. It occurred to me that it might 

 be an anomaly. I therefore made inquiries at Monl Serrado, and the different 

 European settlements that I visited, and ascertained that the same thing had 

 occurred at those points, though it was considered quite unusual. 



I am able here to confirm the truth of Mr. Smeathman's statement, that the 

 king and queen are permanently enclosed in their apartment, which has been 

 doubted by the eminent writer of the article Termitida;, in the British Cyclopae- 

 dia of Natural History, (understood to be J. 0. Westwood, Esq.) 



The sentence in which the doubt occurs, runs as follows : '• The young queen 

 of the hive swarms, is followed by a portion of the community ; and the female 

 after swarming:, and the loss of her wings, is guarded by the worker ants ; there 

 is, therefore, so much analogy in these circumstances, that we are almost tempted 

 to consider that Snieathman must have erred in stating that the working Termites 

 imprison both the king and queen Termes. That it should be necessary for the 

 latter to be carefully guarded, will be very evident ; but why the king in his 

 helpless and wingless state, (for we consider that the loss of wings is consequent 




1849.] 217 



upon and not precedent to pairing, should be shut up, seems questionable. We 

 make these observations with hesitation, because Latrielle and Kirby and 

 Spence seem to adopt, without hesitation, this statement of Smeathman." 



I feel it my duty to notice particularly this doubt, coming as it does from a 

 source of such high respectability as the present Corresponding Secretary of the 

 London Ent. Soc, J. 0. Westwood, Esq. 



It should be remembered that in penning this doubt, Mr. W. was sitting within 

 doors at Hammersmith, Eng., many thousand miles distant from the scene of Mr. 

 Smeathman's patient and prolonged observation. Mr. S. states what he knew to 

 be a fact, and, respecting which, I can see no way in which he could.be mis- 

 taken. Mr. W. misapprehends a remark of Mr. Smeathman on their " swarm- 

 ing," if it can be so called. I do not understand Mr. S. to state that the queen 

 is accompanied by any other individuals than those of the two sexes — other per- 

 fect males and females. He says that as workers are always to be found on the 

 surface of the ground, the king and queen are captured by them, and thus made 

 to become the heads of new communities. On what foundation this statement 

 rests, I know not; but must confess that in this part of their economy I think 

 there exists a lucuna yet to be filled. As to the statement, however, involving 

 the perpetual imprisonment of the king and queen, I have no doubt. The facts 

 respecting the structure of the "royal chamber" sufficiently prove it. Any one 

 who has seen a fully developed queen, will say that she is incapable of progres- 

 sion, and the fact that no aperture has been discovered in the " chrvmber" among 

 the many hills dissected at different seasons, sufficient to admit of the ingress 

 and egress of the king, and hardly of the larger class of soldiers, must suffice. 



It has been stated also by compilers of Smeathman, that the insect shrinks 

 from light, which is a reason for their constructing covered ways. But, if it be 

 remembered that the two orders — soldiers and workers — are perfectly blind, the 

 assertion must appear to be gratuitous. The true cause of their erection of 

 covered ways would seem to lie in the fact that the insect is a prey to a vast 

 number of other insects, reptiles, &c. 



Smeathman and others state that Termes bellicosus is the insect which de- 

 vours dwelling houses, furniture, &c. This also I consider an error. I doubted 

 its accuracy at the inception of my observations, and made inquiries subsequently 

 of intelligent observers at Sierra Leone and Montserrado, all of whom confirmed 

 me in my doubts. The white ants found in our houses, preying on our furniture, 

 books, &c., are smaller, and larger in proportion to their breadth than T. belli- 

 cosus. The soldiers which accompany the laborers and found with them in their 

 covered ways along the sills, floors and roofs of our houses, differ palpably in 

 these respects from those of T. bellicosus. I made known my doubts on this 

 point to my correspondent, Mr. Westwood, of London, proving the truth of my 

 statement by specimens taken from my own dwellings, but, unfortunately, the 

 bottles containing them were broken, and I failed of my object. I consider these 

 house eaters as the T. arborum of Smeathman. One of their nests, indeed, I 

 found in the roof of my oflSce, and by them great damage was done to the build- 

 ing, besides many books were destroyed, having been eaten through and through. 

 Another nest also was found in a small outbuilding ; the insects of these two 

 nests corresponded to those found in my dwellings, &c., while marked differences 

 existed between the latter and T. bellicosus. I regret exceedingly that the steps 

 to prove this opinion have failed in the manner above stated. I hesitate not, 

 however, to assert it, confirmed as it is by other observers.

The work was begun with three men at 20 minutes past 4, V. St., and re- 

 quired '1\ hours to accomplish it. 



Tlie material was red clay obtained about two feet below the surface soil, the 

 latter being a mixture of sand and decayed vegetable matter brought down from 

 the surrounding hills. The surface was highly indurated, receiviug a slight 

 impression from a single blow of the mattock. 



The order first seen was the workers, who instantly retreated on exposure 

 to the external air. They were succeeded by one and then another, and then 

 many of the larger class of soldiers, who, rushing out in great rage with jaws 

 extended, threatened vengeance on the intruders. 



The experiment of permitting them to bite was tried several times, when it 

 was perceived that a drop of brownish fluid was exuded upon the part. The 

 sensation was like that of a minute sharp cutting instrument, the jaws moving 

 in cross direction like scissors. 



On breaking several of the upward projections or "turrets," they were per- 

 ceived to be hollow, leading into the "dome," and the main passages in the 

 walls down to the basement. These several passages were smooth, as if by 

 being well worn by constant tread, and it undoubtedly is through them that 

 their food is brought from below to the " magazines." The first fragment of 

 the hill exposed numerous apparent perforations, from the size of a shot to 

 that of a dollar, which were increased by everj- stroke ; these were the different 

 passages, running in every direction aud anastomosing with each other, keep- 

 ing up a communication throughout the domicil. 



The walls seemed to be about twelve inches thick, and contained numerous 

 cavities or cells of various sizes and shapes, with young in different stages of 

 growth, extremely white and delicate. They communicated with each other and 

 with the main passages. The number of young contained in them varied from 

 twelve to twenty. When several were found in one cell, they were regularly 

 and closely packed, with their heads converging towards the bottom. The first 

 idea which this arrangement presented to my mind, was that of pigs in an 

 autumnal night, stowed in the angle of a " Virginia fence." 



Having beaten away the wall of the hill, a layer of light brown spongy sub- 

 stance was seen, its structure irregularly cellular, and enclosed in red moist 

 clay of corresponding form ; the " nurseries " of Smeathman. The cells con- 

 tained young of different sizes ; on the surface were visible numerous scattered 

 minute white globular bodies, probably fungi. Messrs. Kirby and Spence sup- 

 pose them to belong to the genus Mucor. But the mucoridei are generated from 

 decayed animal and stercoraceous matter. Without a microscopic examination, 

 they seem to me to be assigned more naturally to the Trichocisti, perhaps Tri- 

 chia. the pin head fungi^ which are known to spring from decayed vegetable 

 substance. It is highly probable that the material of which these nurseries are 

 made, is at base vegetable matter. Their extent, as thus observed, is from the 




1849.] 219 



base to two-thirds the height of the sides of the hill. Centrally to these, and 

 lying immediately under the floor of the "dome," was a series of cellular work, 

 entirely of clay, filled with a chestnut-brown substance, very moist, having the 

 appearance of rasped or gnawed wood, and other vegetable matter. These are 

 Smeathman's " magazines," and '* food," which, with the nurseries, constitute 

 almost two-thirds of the contents of the structure. 



Throughout the nurseries were found young in different stages of growth ; those 

 in the external cells were smaller and mostly without rudimental wings ; those 

 in the interior cells were larger, with distinctly developed mandibles, and rudi- 

 mentary wings generally, the j>y pes of soldiers. The young in the interior of 

 this cellular work, with a few exceptions, were assuming the yellow color which 

 marks the head and thorax of the workers and soldiers in their perfect or active 

 State ; the exceptions were of a pure white. 



As the larger passages were opened, a strong current of warm air from within 

 was perceptible. I attempted to look down the " dome," but was compelled to 

 withdraw immediately, my respiration being affected, and the glasses of my spec- 

 tacles coated with a film of moisture ; a strong, peculiar, but not unpleasant, 

 odor was perceived. It was observed, that the deeper we penetrated, the more 

 numerous became the young, and the more advanced were they in growth. 



The structure called the " royal chamber" by Smeathman was discovered in 

 position central in respect to the circumference of the hill, and about eighteen 

 inches above the surface of the ground. Around and beneath it, was a connected 

 aeries of clayey cellular work, in which were found the young, as before stated. 

 The chamber was of an oblong shape, rounded at the ends and sides ; flattened 

 and thick above and below. It was supported on one side by two pillars, about 

 I of an inch in diameter ; on the other, it was attached to the surrounding clay 

 work. I accidentally broke open the enclosure, being misled by the statement 

 of Smeathman, that it was situated on a level with the surface of the ground. 

 The queen was discovered, surrounded by a large number of the larger laborers, 

 a few soldiers, and some of the more advanced pupae, all of whom were running 

 rapidly round her, manifesting the greatest perturbation. The queen made 

 great efi"orts at progression, constantly turning her head and thorax from side to 

 side, but without moving in the least her huge abdomen. Her whole length 

 was 4^ inches. The king, evidently in great alarm, made repeated eff"ort3 to 

 conceal himself under the abdominal folds of his consort. 



On examining further the '• royal chamber," a wide cavity was observed run- 

 ning horizontally along the upper part, or roof, externally, but without any signs 

 of communication with the interior. On the under surface of the roof, or ceiling 

 is a long depression, corresponding in shape to the body of the queen, which 

 gives her that freedom of motion necessary to the extension of her eggs. This 

 motion is compound, first in a longitudinal, then transverse direction, alternate- 

 ly elongating, contracting and widening her body, being marked with short, 

 thick, transverse bands, the skin is thrown into folds, while these bands operate 

 as so many fixed points, or centres of muscular action, forcing the eggs through 

 their ducts to the place of exit. 



For some time after exposure, the queen continued the expulsion of her eggs, 

 but, not as I am inclined to think, to the usual extent. They were white and 

 very minute, and left untouched by the workers, who evidently contiuded in a 

 state of the greatest alarm. 



The floor of the chamber was perfectly plane and smooth, exhibiting not the 

 slightest impression from the body of the queeu. The roof in the centre was 




220 



[Sept. 



} of an inch thick ; the floor about | ; nt the line of conjunction about J. Poste- 

 riorly in the line of junction, between the roof and flour was a small aperture, 

 sheltered from above by a spur of clay running downwards, which was the only 

 way discovered of ingress and egress. It could not have admitted an insect 

 larger than the soldiers, and even to them, as it then appeared, it must have 

 been a "strait gate." The king could not have passed, and consequenily not 

 the queen. It had the appearance of having been repeatedly closed and opened 

 by collections of clay around it. 



That the queen is enclosed for life, is evident from the fact that she in. from 

 her great size, incapable of progression of herself, or of being transported by 

 any means witiiin the power of the community. 



On clearing away the refuse at the base of the hill, the orifices of the main 

 passages under the basement were discovered; descending in a sloping direc- 

 tion, they led to large vacant rooms, made by the pillars supportiug the arch- 

 work ; on which rests the interior of the structure. These pillais, or columns, 

 were of an irregular, rounded shape, from J to 2J inches in diameter, and stood 

 on the solid ground about six inches high. 



On visiting this hill the next morning, all the passages in that portion of the 

 wall not dissected, were found well closed with fresh deposits of clay, and also 

 a continuous layer spread over the remaining central cellular work. This was 

 done during the night by the surviving members of the community for their pro- 

 teetion against thf cool air of the night, the rain, and hostile insects. 



The opening of a hill is the signal for the gathering of all their foes, — ants, 

 reptiles, &c. ; hence the speedy closing of their various entrances, is a step of 

 primary importance. 



Another hill, previously dissected, was, after a time, so far repaired, as to be 

 externally perfect. On taking it down again, though the cellular work was appa- 

 rently restored, no queen was found, nor royal appartments;a few workers were all 

 the insects discovered, and they were collected in the cells in the walls of the bill. 



Hill 2d.— Opened Feb. 3d, 1847. 



Circumference at base 26 ft. 10 in. 



Height on the outer surface 8 ft. 6 in. 



A diagonal section was made by a cross cut saw, beginning just below the 

 upper floor of Smeathman. 



The walls were much the thickest on the north side, nearly double those on 

 the south, measuring 1^ feet through. 



It being in a locality where sand and gravel abounded, these materials were 

 freely mixed with the clay. 



The covered ways leading from the base to objects of plunder at a distance, 

 were in this case larger and more numerous than any I have seen before. The 

 main one measured 12 inches in diameter, and gave off several branches, which 

 proceeded in various directions. These were traced to sticks, stumps and logs, 

 which afforded them prey. 



In this case, the laborers in the hill were generally of the smaller class, while 

 those in the covered ways and in the stumps were larger. Laving strong stout 

 jaws, well adapted to the gnawing of wood. The " royal chamber " was found 

 raised about 1 J feet above the level of the ground. 



HiU 3d. — Circumference at base, 50 feet. Height, 14 feet. 



The notes do not state whether this is the perpendicular height or not. Several 

 fresh turrets were erected ou the top.having a moist,deep red,granular appearance. 




1849.] 221 



The structure called the "royal chamber," measured externally 10 inches in 

 length, internally 8 inches. Its height from the level of the ground was 2 feet 

 8 inches. The length of the queen 4| inches. 



Shrubs or small trees are frequently seen growing up through the hills. 

 Such trees are never seen dead, consequently are not eaten by the insect. 



On leave granted, Dr. John Neill presented an abstract of a paper writ- 

 ten for the American Journal of Medical Sciences, entitled " Observations 

 on the Occipital and Superior Maxillary Bones of the African Cranium." 

 A peculiarity in the condyloid process of the occiput was pointed out, 

 which is not generally noticed in works on Anatomy. It consists in 

 a division of the process into two parts by a ridge or groove ; showing 

 a tendency in the basi-occipital bone of the foetal, or young head, to 

 be permanently retained. This peculiarity occurs oftener in the Afri- 

 can than in any other head. In this respect there is an analogy to the 

 lower orders of the vertebrata. The superior maxillary bone of the 

 African head is also defective in a ridge which is continuous with the 

 nasal process, and reaches to the anterior nasal spinal in the Caucasian 

 head. In the African, the lower edge of the anterior nares is flat, and 

 in this respect resembles the foetal head, and the heads of inferior animals. 



On leave granted. Dr. Morton made the following observations on 

 the capacity of the skull in the difi'erent races of man. 



Observations on the size of the Brain in various Races and Families of Man. 

 By Samcel George Morton, M. D. 



I have great pleasure in submitting to the Academy the results of the internal 

 measurements of six hundred and twenty-three human crania, made with a view 

 to ascertain the relative size of the brain in various races and families of Man. 



These measurements have been made by the process invented by my friend 

 Mr. J. S. Phillips, and described in my Crania Americana, p. 253, merely sub- 

 stituting leaden shot, one-eighth of an inch in diameter, in place of the white 

 mustard-seed originally used. I thus obtained the absolute capacity of the cranium^ 

 or bulk of the brain^ in cubic inches; and the results are annexed in all those in- 

 stances in which I have had leisure to put this revised mode of measurement in 

 piactice. I have restricted it, at least for the purpose of my inferential conclu- 

 sions, to the crania of persons of sixteen years of age and upwards, at which 

 period the brain is believed to possess the adult size. Under this age, the 

 capacity-measurement has only been resorted to for the purpose of collateral 

 comparison ; nor can I avoid expressing my satisfaction at the singular accuracy 

 of this method, since a skull of an hundred cubic inches, if measured any num- 

 ber of times with reasonable care, will not vary a single cubic inch. 



All these measurements have been made with my own hands. I at one time 

 employed a person to assist me ; but having detected some errors in his measure- 

 ments, I have been at the pains to revise all that part of the series that had not 

 been previously measured by myself. I can now, therefore, vouch for the accu- 

 racy of these multitudinous data, which I cannot but regard as a novel and im- 

 portant contribution to Ethnological science. 



I am now engaged in a memoir which will embrace in detail the conjjusions 

 that result from these data; meanwhile I submit the following tabular view of 

 the prominent facts.

TABLE, 



Showing the Size of the Brain in cubic inches, as obtained from the internal 

 measurement q/'C23 Crania of various Races and Families of Man. 




1849.] 223 



Tlie measiirements of children, idiots aud mixed races are omitted from this 

 table, excepting only in the instance of the Fellahs of Egyjjt, who, however, are 

 a blended stock of two Caucasian nations, — the true Egyptian and the intrusive 

 Arab, in which the characteristics of the former greatly predominate. 



No mean has been taken of the Caucasian race* collectively, because of the 

 very great preponderance of Hindu, Egyptian and Fellah skulls over those of the 

 Germanic, Pelasgic and Celtic families. Nor could any just collective comparison 

 be instituted between the Caucasian and Negro group in such a table, unless the 

 small-brained people of the latter division (Hottentots, Bushmen and Austra- 

 lians) were proportionate in number to the Hindoos, Egyptians and Fellahs of 

 the other group. Such a computation, were it practicable, would probably re- 

 duce the Caucasian average to about 87 cubic inches, and the Negro to 78 at 

 most, perhaps even to 85, and thus confirmatively establish the difference of 

 at least nine cubic inches between the mean of the two races.* 



Large as this collection already is, a glance at the Table will show that it is 

 very deficient in some divisions of the human family. For example, it contains 

 no crania of the Eskimaux, Fuegians, Californians or Brazilians. The skulls 

 of the great divisions of the Caucasian and Mongolian races are also too few 

 for satisfactory comparison, and the Sclavonic and Tchudic (Finnish) nations, 

 together with the Mongol tribes of Northern Asia and China, are among the 

 especial desiderata of this collection. 



Among the facts elicited by this investigation are the following : 



1. The Teutonic or German race, embracing, as it does, the Anglo-Saxons, 

 Anglo-Americans, Anglo-Irish, &c., possess the largest brain of any other people. 



2. Tlie nations having the smallest heads, are the ancient Peruvians and 

 Australians. 



3. The Barbarous tribes of America possess a much larger brain than the 

 demi-civilized Peruvians or Mexicans. 



*It is necessary to explain what is here meant by the word race. Further re- 

 searches into Ethnographic affinities will probably demonstrate that what are 

 now termed the /re races of men, would be more appropriately called groups : 

 that each of these groups is again divisible into a greater or smaller number of 

 primary races, each of which has expanded from an aboriginal nucleus or centre. 

 Thus I conceive that there were several centres for the American group of races, 

 of which the highest in the scale are the Toltecan nations, the lowest the Fuegi- 

 ans. Nor does this view conflict with the general principle, that all these 

 nations and tribes have had, as I have elsewhere expressed it, a common 

 origin ; inasmuch as by this term is only meant an indigenous relation to the 

 country they inhabit, and that collective identity of physical traits, mental and 

 moral endowments, language, kc, which characterize all the American races. 

 The same remarks are applicable to all the other human races ; but in the 

 present infant state of Ethnographic science, the designation of these primitive 

 centres is a task of equal delicacy and difficulty. I may here observe, that 

 whenever 1 have ventured an opinion on this question, it has been in favor of 

 the doctrine of primeval diversities among men, — an original adaptation of the 

 several races to those varied circumstances of climate and locality, which, while 

 congenial to the one are destructive to the other; and subsequent investigations 

 have confirmed me in these views. See Crania Americana, p. 3 ; Crania 

 JEgyptiaca, p. 37; Distirictive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America, 

 p. 36 ; Sillimayi's American Journal of Science and the Arts, 1847 ; and my Let- 

 ter to J. R. Bartlett, Esq., in Vol. 2 of the Transactions of the Ethnological 

 Society of New York. '' 




224 [Oct. 



4. The ancient Egyptians, whoso civilization ante-dates that of all other 

 people, and whose country has heen justly called " the cradle of tlxp arts and 

 sciences," have the least-sized brain of any Caucasian nation, excepting the 

 Hindoos ; for the small number of Semitic heads will hardly pennit them to 

 be admitted into the comparison. 



5. The Negro brain is nine cubic inches less than the Teutonic, and three 

 cubic inches larger than the ancient Egyptian. 



6. The largest brain in the series is that of a Dutch gentleman, and gives 

 114 cnbic inches ; the smallest head is an old Peruvian, of 58 cubic inches ; and 

 the difference between these two extremes is no less than 56 cubic inches. 



7. The brain of the Australian and Hottentot fall far below the Negro, and 

 measures precisely the same as the ancient Peruvian. 



8. This extended series of measurements fully confirms the fact stated by 

 me in the Crania Americana, that the various artificial modes of di-storting the 

 cranium, occasion no diminution of its internal capacity, and consequently do 

 not affect the size of the brain.

Dr. Leidy offered the following observations : 



From the opinion so frequently expressed that contagious diseases and some 

 others might have their origin and reproductive character through the agency 

 of cryptogamic spores, which, from their minuteness and lightness, are so easily 

 conveyed from place to place through the atmosphere, by means of the gentlest 

 zephyr, or even the evaporation continually taking place from the earth's surface ; 

 and from the numerous facts already presented of the presence of cryptogamic 

 vegetation in many cutaneous diseases and upon other diseased surfaces, I was 

 led to reflect upon the possibility of plants of this description existing in healthy 

 animals, as a natural condition ; or, at least, apparently so, as in the case of 

 entozoa. Upon considering that the conditions essential to vegetable growth 

 were the same as those indispensable to animal life, I felt convinced that ento- 

 phyta would be found in healthy living animals, as well, and probably as fre- 

 quently, as entozoa. The constant presence of mycodermatoid filaments growing 

 upon the human teeth, the teeth of the ox, sheep, pig, &c., favored this idea, and 

 accordingly I instituted a course of investigations, which led to the discovery of 

 several well characterized forms of vegetable growth, of which at present, I will 

 give but a short description, for the purpose of establishing priority, arid propose 

 giving a more detailed account of them, with figures, in the second volume of 

 the Journal. 



Enterobrus,* a new genus of Confervaeea, Simple, attached, isolated filaments, 

 consisting of a long cylindrical cell, (containing protoplasma, granules, and 

 large translucent globules enveloped in a primordial utricle.) with a distinct 

 coriaceous peduncle or stipe of attachment, and at length producing at the free 

 extremity one or two, rarely three, shorter cylindrical cells, (filled with the same 

 matter as the parent cell.) 



Enterohrus elegans. Filaments olive brown, brownish, yellowish, or color- 

 less, at first forming a single apical turn, and then passing in a straight or gently 

 curved line to the free extremity. Peduncle, or stipe of attachment, adhering 

 very firmly, coriaceous, uniformly brownish, narrower than the frond cell, papil- 

 lary, columnar, elongated, conical or pyramidal, expanded at base and at point 

 of attachment to frond cell, marked with longitudinal lines, and frequently with 

 transverse annular constrictions, with no definite interior structure. Length 

 from l-3750th to l-400th of an inch; breadth i-3200th to l-6G6th. Frond cell 

 much elongated, frequently reaching the length of 2 or 3 lines, uniformly cylin- 

 drical, excepting at free extremity, where it is usually clavate ; breadth in full 

 grown individuals pretty uniformly l-935th of an inch. Contents consisting ofa 

 colorless protoplasma, with more or less numerous fine, translucent, yellowish or 

 colorless granules, measuring about 1-15, 000th of an inch, and numerous large, 

 colorless, transparent globules or vesicles filled with fluid, averaging the l-2870th 

 of an inch in diameter. End cells only existing in full grown individuals, one, 

 usually two, rarely three in number; the first one cylindrical, l-86th of an inch 

 in length by 1-lOOOth in breadth, filled with more granules and less globules 

 than the parent cell ; end cell clavate, l-135th of an inch long by 1 -TfiOth broad, 

 at the clavate end l-638th, filled with granular matter and a few globules.

Lnngth of full grown individaiil 2 to 3 somctimea 4 lincB. 

 JIahitai. Grows from tlic basement membrane of the mucous irembrane of the 

 sranll iutestine of Julua marginntus, Say, occasionally from the same membrane 

 at the commencement of the large intestine, and also from any part of the ex- 

 terior surface of Ascaris infecta and Aorurus : entozoa infesting tiiese portions 

 of the intestinal canal uf ihis animal. 



Theyoungcst individuals of Enterobrus which I everdetected, measured l-380lh 

 of an inch in length by 1-1'JGOih in breadth, but the most usual sizes vary from 

 the 1-ljOth of an inch to the full grown iudividual. At all ages they cunlain the 

 same character of contents, but in the younger ones, the large globules are usually 

 predominant, sometimes to such an extent as to exclude the other maitere. When 

 quite young they are usually more or less clavate and straight, a little more ad- 

 vanced tbey form a gentle curve, about one-eighth of a circle. A little older, the 

 distal half or third becomrs uniformly dilated, and forms an obtuse angle with 

 the other portion ; after this as it continues growing, it usually forms a ?ingle spi- 

 ral turn, becomes uniformly dilated, and thus advanced to the full grown individual. 

 The cell contents consist principally of large transparent globules with granules 

 and protoplasma in the interstices. Frequently the cells are found distended with 

 the globules to such an extent that the other matters almost, and occasionally 

 even entirely disappear, iodine turns the protoplasma and granules deep yellow 

 or very deep brown, and causes the rupture of the globules, when a clear fluid is 

 observed to exude ; very slightly colored purplish, or nndergoing no change of 

 color from the iodine. Solution of iodine, acetic acid, salt water, or the pro- 

 longed action of water alone, causes a contraction of the cell contents from the 

 sides of the permanent cell wall, but they are still held together by an appa- 

 rent delicate membrane of the character of a primordial utricle. Frequently in 

 dead individuals, the interior contents shrink to two-thirds, occasionally to one- 

 third the diameter of the cell calibre, and almost 8 to 20 times the diameter of the 

 cell from each extremity, when they have the appearance of a shrivelled granular 

 membrane. In these latter cases the characteristic globules and granules have 

 disappeared, and their place is more or less occupied with water, and yellowish 

 globular, highly refractive bodies, which resemble oil. These latter globules 

 vary in size from a mere point up to one-fourth the diameter of the cell. The 

 smaller ones are contained within the shrivelled primordial utricle with a few of 

 the larger ones, and a number of the latter occupy a position between the pri- 

 mordial utricle and the cell wall, apparently formed by a conjunction of the 

 smaller globules and an exudation through the primordial utricle during the act 

 of contraction consequent upon decomposition. They are insoluble in alcohol, 

 but are soluble in ether and a solution of potassa ; in fact in all their properties 

 they resemble oil. Can these be oil globules, the result of decomposition? 



The protoplasma or fluid of the cells is colorless or faintly yellowish, contracts 

 or coagulates ujion the application of alcohol, and is colored brown by iodine, 

 having all the characters usually possessed by that albuminoid fluid found in 

 all young vegetable cells and denominated protoplasma by H. von Mohl. 



The clear granules are minute, yellowish and resemble fine oil globules. They 

 are turned deep brown by the action of iodine. 



The clear globules appear to consist of a delicate vesicular membrane proba- 

 ■ bly derived from the primordial utricle, filled with a colorless fluid. 




1849.] 227 



No circulatory or other movement as in Acbyla prolifera, exists in the cell 



contents. The end cells of the full grown individuals are usually two in number 



a nd much shorter than the parent cell. Occasionally I have found three end 



cells, more frequently but one. These cells are formed from the parent cells, 



b y a contraction first taking place in their contents with the primordial utricle, 



a partition from the permanent cell wall forming afterwards. 



The end cells are probably spore cases ; their contents are usually a dense 



ass of fine granules, similar to those of the parent cell, with a few intermingled 

 globules. I never saw any movement, molecular or other, in the contained 

 matter, except during decomposition. 



A question may arise as to the true situation of this plant among the crypto- 



amia. I have placed it in the order Confervaceae, from the diagnosis given 



y Endlicher, in his Genera Plantarum : " Fila capillaria, membranacea v. fila- 

 mentosa, intus v. extus articulata, simplicia v. ramosa, libera (i. e. hand in 

 frondem coalita,) interdum tamen reticulatim contexta, viridia v. rarius fusca 

 aut purpurea, in formis infimis hyalina, etc." 



Cladophytum,'^ a new genus of entophyta allied to the Mycodermata. Filaments 

 minute, attached by means of a roundish nucleus, simple, or compounded near 

 the base of attachment, with a minute lateral ramuli, inarticulate, and with no 

 evidence of interior structure. 



Cladophytum comatum. Filaments delicate, regular, colorless- simple, more 

 frequently branched near the base at very acute angles, growing in more or 

 less dense bunches from a yellowish rounded or oval, attached, nuclear body, 

 varying in size from l-7500th l-600th of an inch. Lateral ramuli very minute, 

 measuring in length from l-15,000th to l-3000th of an inch, and passing oflF at 

 cute angles. No indication of articulation or interior structure. 



Length from l-666th to l-120th of an inch. 



Habitat. — Growing more or less profusely from the mucous membrane of the 

 small intestine of Julus marginatus, occasionally from the same surface at the 

 commencement of the large intestine, from any part of the exterior surface of 

 entozoa infesting those cavities, and also from any part of the surface of Entero- 

 brus elegans. 



ArthTomitus^\ a second new genus of entophyta, allied to the Mycodermata. — 

 Filaments always simple, cylindric, articulated, without ramuli, attached by 

 means of a nuclear body, and with no evidence of interior structure. 



Anthromitus cristatus. Filaments delicate, straight or inflected, growing in tufts 

 usally of moderate density, from minute, attached, yellowish rounded or oval 

 nuclear bodies. Articuli short, cylindric, uniform, measuring l-9090th in. in 

 length by 1-15, 000th in breadth, with no traces of interior structure. 



Length l-375th to l-46th of an inch, breadth 1-15, 000th in. 



Habitat. — Same as Cladophytum comatum, but rarely growing in such dense 

 tufts. 



The three genera of entophyta of which I have now spoken, are all so con- 

 stantly found in the Julus marginatus, that I look upon it as a natural condition, 

 and should 1 hereafter meet with an individual without them, I will consider it a 

 rare exception, because, in one hundred and sixteen individuals which I have ei- 



*KAa<roc et pwTov. •{■AjSjoy et fxirof. , 




228 [Oct. 



amiiied during tlio past thirteen months, in all seasons, and at all ages and sizes 

 of from one up to three inches of the animal, I have invariably found them. It 

 cannot bo supposed that these are devcIoi)cd and grow after death, because I 

 found them always immediatily upon killing the animal. Whilst the legs of 

 fragments of the animals were yet moving upon my table, or one half the body 

 even walking, I have frequently been examining the plants growing upon part 

 of the intestinal canal of the same individual. And upon the entozoa, these 

 entophyta will be frequently found growing, whilst the former are actively mov- 

 ing about. I found among an apcaris three lines long, which had no less than 

 than twenty-three individuals of Enterobrus averaging a line in length, besides a 

 quantity of the other two genera growing upon it, and yet it moved about in so 

 lively a manner that it did not appear the least incommoded by its load of vege- 

 tation. This specimen I have preserved in a glass cell in Qoadby's solution, 

 and exhibit it to the Academy. 



The animals were uniformly enjoying good health, i. e. all the organic and 

 animal functions were natural; they eat, grew, reached their definite size, re- 

 produced, and in fact, presented all those actions characteristic of the normal 

 state of existence of the animal. 



The genus Julus is an extensive one, and its species are found in all the great 

 parts of the globe, and as their habits are the same, the conditions for the pro- 

 duction of the entophyta will be the same, and I think I do not go too far when 

 I say they will be constantly found throughout the genus in any part of the 

 world, so that naturalists and others may, upon examination, readily verify or 

 contradict the statements which I have this evening presented. 



From these facts we perceive that we may have entophyta in luxurious growth 

 within living animals, without affecting their health, which is further supported 

 by my having detected mycodermatoid filaments in the coecum of six young 

 and healthy rats, examined immediately after death, although they existed in 

 no other part of the body. These filaments were minute, simple, and inarticu- 

 late, measuring from l-5000th to l-1428th in. in length, by 1-16-OOOth of an 

 inch in breadth. With them were also found two species of Vibrio. 



Even those moving filamentary bodies belonging to the genus Vibrio, I am in- 

 clined to think, are of the character of algous vegetation. Their movement is no 

 objection to this opinion, for much higher confervae, as the Oscillatorias, are en- 

 dowed with inherent power of movement, not very unlike that of the Vibrio, and 

 indeed the movement of the latter appears to belong only to one stage of its exist- 

 ence. Thus, in the toad, (Bufo americanus,) in the stomach and small intestine, 

 there exist simple, delicate, filamentary bodies, which are of three different kinds. 

 One is exceedingly minute, forms a single spiral, is endowed with a power of rapid 

 movement, and appears to be the Spirillum undula of of Ehrenberg; the second is 

 an exceedingly minute, straight and short filament, with a movement actively mole- 

 cular in character, and is probably the Vibrio lineola of the same author; the third 

 consists of straight, motionless filaments, measuring 1-1 125th in. long, by 

 1-15, 000th broad; some were, however, twice, or even thrice this length, but then 

 I could always detect one or two articulations, and these, in all their characters, 

 excepting want of movement, resemble the Vibrio. In the rectum of the same 

 animal, the same filamentary bodies are found, with myriads of Bodo intestina- 

 lis ; but the third species, or longest of the filamentary bodies, have increased 

 immensely in numbers, and now possess the movement peculiar to the Vibrio 




1849.] 229 



liaeola, which, however, does not appear to be voluntary, but reactionary ; they 

 bend and pursue a straight course, until they meet with some obstacle, whea 

 they instantly move in the opposite direction, either extremity forward. 



But it must not be understood that these facts militate against the hypothesis 

 of the production of contagious diseases through the agency of cryptogamia. It 

 is as well established that there are microscopic cryptogamia capable of produ- 

 cing and transmitting disease, as in the case of the Muscardine, &c., as that there 

 are innocuous and poisonous fungi. But to suppose that they are the sole cause of 

 contagious disease, is to doubt the possibility of other causes, such as a change ia 

 the chemical constitution of the atmosphere, the elements of our food, &c., and 

 is as ridiculous as the psoric origin of most diseases of that miserable charlatanry 

 denominated homoeopathy. In many instances it is difficult to distinguish their 

 character, whether as cause or effect, as upon diseased surfaces, in Tinea capitis, 

 apthous ulcers, &c. In a post-mortem examination, in which I assisted Dr. 

 Horner, a few weeks since, 28 hours after death, in moderately cool weather, 

 we found the stomach in a much softened condition. In the mucus of the 

 stomach, I detected myriads of mycodermatoid filaments, resembling those grow- 

 ing upon the teeth; simple, floating, inarticulate, and measuring from I-YOOOth 

 to I-520th of an inch in length, by 1-25, 000th of an inch in breadth. It is pos- 

 sible they may have been the cause of the softened condition ; but I would 

 prefer thinking that swallowed mycodermatoid filaments from the teeth, finding 

 an excellent nidus in the softening stomach, rapidly grew and reproduced them- 

 selves. In the healthy human stomach these do not exist. 



In the stomach of a diabetic patient, I found so very few that they probably 

 did not grow there, but were swallowed in the saliva. 



Dr. Leidy, after exhibiting numerous drawings of the entophyta described by 

 him, and also specimens, beneath the microscope, growing from the mucous 

 membrane of the small intestine of Julus, and from the exterior surface of en- 

 tozoa infesting that cavity, proceeded to exhibit and describe some new genera 

 and species of entozoa, as follows : 



1. Ascaris cylindrica. Body nearly cylindrical throughout, anteriorly mode- 

 rately attenuated ; tail curved, l-214th of an inch in length from the anus, oeso- 

 phagus elongated, gibbous in the middle, with the oesophageal bulb and pharynx 

 1- 100th of an inch in length ; oesophageal bulb pyriform,l-75th of an inch in diam- 

 eter ; ventricle or intestine somewhat tortuous, cylindrical, dilated at both ex- 

 tremities ; rectum pyriform ; female generative aperture about half way between 

 the mouth and tail. Whole length 4-5th of a line, breadth I-12th of a line. 



Habitat. — Small intestine of Helix alternata. 



Remarks. — I found the female only of this species in fifteen out of forty speci- 

 mens of Helix alternata, in numbers of from one to three. The ovaries in all 

 were distended with ova, the latter measuring l-430th of an inch in length by 

 l-576th in breadth. 



2. Ascaris infecta. Female, subcylindrical gradually diminishing towards the 

 extremities, white, with a brown streak down the lower two-thirds of the middle 

 line ; aateriorly obtusely rounded ; tail slightly curved, l-80th of an inch long 

 from the anus. The three papillae of the mouth projecting ; oesophagus strongly

muscular, tliick, oblong, pyrifonn, l-8()th of ftn in<'h lonp^jpreatest breadth l-17r)th 

 of an inch; oesophageal bulbjCordifonn, l-l<;tilhof an inch long, by 1-OCthofan 

 inch broa'l ; ventricle slightly diluted at cotnmcncoment, contraiied i)oijteriorly ; 

 generative orifice projecting, just below the middle of the body. Vagina fur- 

 nished with a large ovate seminal receptacle. 



Male, dilated at both extremities ; tail thick, l-174th of an inch long. fnrni.<hed 

 upon its inner aspect with two minute tubercles. Above the anus arc two rows, 

 each of four tubercles, connected by delicate folds of integument. Oesophagus 

 1-lllth of an inch long, by l-2C0th of an inch broad ; oesophageal bulb depressed 

 cordiform 1-2 14th of an inch long, by l-250th of an inch broad. I'enis formed 

 of two curved spioul.x-, measuring in length, in a straight line, l-73ih of an inch. 



Length of adult female, 3 to 4} lines; breadth at origin of rentriculus l-12.3d 

 of an inch; middle of body 1-831 to l-60th of an inch ; just above anus l-144th 

 of an inch. Ova l-319th of an inch long, by l-428th inch broad. 



Length of male 2 lines; breadth at origin of ventriculus l-176lh of an inch; 

 middle of body l-211th of an inch; just above anus l-202d of an inch Sper- 

 matophori oval, 1-1391 inch long, by 4- 1666th inch broad, with ^spermatozoa 

 l-3750th inch long, by 1.10,000th inch broad. 



Babitat. — This species is found in numbers of from three up to fifty or more, 

 of various ages and sizes, pretty constantly in the small intestine of Julus mar- 

 ginatus, Say. The males are found in the proportion of about one in eight. 



Aorurus* a new genus of Nemaloideo'. Body cylindrical, strongly annulated, 

 with a tail nearly as long as the body, straight, or nearly so, inflexible, spicu- 

 late, ensiforra, shining, and pointed. Mouth unarmed. Female generative 

 aperture near the middle of the body. 



Remarks. — This genus is divisible, by several well marked characters, into 

 two distinct sub-genera. 



1st sub genus. Streptostoma.]— Body cylindrical, very strongly marked with 

 broad annuli. Mouth moderately large, round, bordered by a collar, (formed by 

 the second annulus projecting beyond the general outline of the body.) (Eso- 

 phagus divided into two distinct pyriform muscular bulbs, with a small inter- 

 mediate rounded bulb. Tail four-fifths the length of the body. 



Streptostoma agile. Female. — Body larva-form, cylindrical, narrowed anteri- 

 orly and posteriorly, opalescent white, divided into from sixty-one to eighty-eight 

 broad annulations, of which there are twenty-one from the mouth to the com- 

 mencement of the ventriculus. Tail very straight, occasionally slightly sigmoid, 

 or bent at the point, narrow and sharply pointed, inflexible and brittle. Mouth 

 moderately large, round, projecting ; pharynx almost null ; oesophagus consisting 

 of three bulbs : the first elongated pyriform, strongly muscular, measuring l-197th 

 in. long, by l-319ih in. broad ; second bulb small, rounded, muscular, l-882d in. 

 long, by l-882d in. broad; third, or true oesophageal bulb, pyriform, l-294thin. 

 long, by l-3r2th in. broad. Ventriculus dilated at commencement to nearly the 

 diameter of the body, afterwards straight and cylindrical to near its termination, 

 where it is slightly dilated. Rectum elongate, pyriform. Generative aperture 



* Aif et c»/ia. \ 2TpvrT6( et o-to^«. 




1849.] 231 



situated about twenty-four rings above the anal aperture, which latter is placed 

 between the last two annuli of the body. Ovary double ; ova l-333d in. long, 

 by l-400th in. broad. 



Length of body from 1-13 to 1-llth inch ; breadth at commencement of ven- 

 triculus l-118th inch ; at middle of body l-97th inch. Tail from 1-16 to l-15th 

 inch long, by l-888th in. broad at its middle. 



2nd sub-genus. — Thelastoma.* 



Body cylindrical, attenuated anteriorly, strongly marked with moderately 

 broad annuli. Mouth small, opening at the extremity of a small papilla. (Eso- 

 phagus divided into two distinct portions, the first long and cylindrical, the 

 second constituting the true oesophageal bulb. Tail more than half the length 

 of the body. 



Thelastoma attenuatum. — Female. Body attenuated anteriorly to commence- 

 ment of the ventriculus, opalescent white, divided into from 140 to 160 annu- 

 lations, of which there are from fifty-two to fifty-seven from the mouth 

 to the commencement of the ventriculus. Tail very straight, or very lightly 

 curved or bent, slender, inflexible and brittle, and sharply pointed. Mouth 

 always projected, small, surmounting a small papillary elevation formed by 

 the first annulus of the body. Pharynx very short and narrow ; oesophagus 

 strongly muscular, cylindrical, l-47th in. long, byl-533d in. broad; oesophageal 

 bulb pyriform, l-178th in. long, l-222d in. broad. Ventriculus dilated alse- 

 form at commencement, cylindrical throughout. Rectum short, pyriform. 

 Generative aperture 42 annulations above the anal. Ovary double, ova 1.333d 

 in. long, by 1.400th in. broad. 



Length of body from 1-lOth to l-8th in. ; breadth at middle 1-9.5 th in. Tail 

 l-15th in. long, by 1-lllth in. broad at middle. 



Habitat, and Remarks. — Streptostoma agile and Thelastoma attenuatum are 

 found together prinoipally in the commencement of the large intestine of Julus 

 marginatus, in numbers of from one to fifteen, and less frequently in the small 

 intestine with Ascaris infecta, in numbers of from one to six. It is remarkable, 

 that although I have found from one to fifteen of these two genera, in nine- 

 tenths of the animals examined, I have never yet been able to detect a single 

 male. 



Thelastoma always has the mouth projected, whilst Streptostoma has it re- 

 tracted, producing, in some measure, but by no means wholly, the difl!'erence 

 in size of the oral aperture. 



At first I was inclined to think these two animals were different stages of the 

 aame species, but the adults uniformly correspond to the descriptions given, and 

 in all cases contained more or less perfected ova. 



Their movements are active, wriggling the body in a sigmoid manner and 

 vibrating the delicate spiculated tail, which in sun-light resembles a shininj 

 acicular crystal. 



Thelastoma, from its form of oesophagus and narrower annulations and shorter 

 tail than Streptostoma, occupies a position between the latter and Oxyuris. 



Gregarina Dufour. 



Body consisting of two distinct cells. Inferior cell the larger, marked 



©»x>i et <rToiA.it, .» 




282 [Oct. 



with delicat»<, parallel, longitudinal lines, (muscular ?) and filled with a fine 

 granular matter, obscurinj^ one or two nucleolo-nucleatt'd-organic cells. Su- 

 perior cell placed in a depression of the inferior, surmounted by a Blight 

 papilla in which may he detected two lines, ajjparently outlines, of an oral cana 

 to the interior of the cell which is fillfd with granular matter ; cell wall 

 amorphous and transparent. 



Gregarina larvata. Body opaque white, cylindrical or fusiform, frequently 

 considerably dilated at the middle of the upper third, Superior cell a flat- 

 tened or depressed sphere, received about one-half into a depression of the 

 inferior cell, surmounted by a papillary elevation with traces of a communi- 

 cation with the exterior; interior filled with a finely granular mass resembling 

 oil globules, and measuring from 1-15, 000th to 1-7, 500th in. Length of cell, 

 iu smallest individuals l-123d in. ; in largest l-80th by 1-Glst in. broad. 

 Inferior cell elongated, cylindrical or fusiform, not communicating with the 

 exterior nor with the interior of the superior cell ; filled with a mass of 

 granules resembling that of the superior cell, rendering the larger individuals 

 opaque, but translucent in the smaller ones, and usually obscuring one or 

 two comparatively large nucleolo-nucleated-organic cells, measuring from 

 l-888th to l-308th in. in diameter. Cell-wall marked with exceedingly regular, 

 delicate, longitudinal, parallel lines about l-9375th in. apart, apparently 

 muscular in character. 



Length from 1-lGOth to l-30th in., by 1-S30th to 1-lllth in. in breadth. 



Ilahltat. — Found in numbers of from half a dozen to over a hundred, in the 

 ventriculus of Julus marginatus. 



Gregarina is probably the larva condition of some more perfect animal, but in 

 the 116 individuals of Julus which I have examined, I have not been able to 

 detect any form which could be derivable from it. Creplin doubts its animal- 

 ity.* When I first discovered this body, thinking it to be a larva, I did not 

 examine it carefully, and it was not until some time afterward when, being 

 desirous of ascertaining its true nature, upon examining some fresh specimens 

 beneath the microscope, I detected movements of an animal character, and 

 this led me to seek for muscular structure, which resulted in the discovery of 

 the longitudinal lines of the inferior cell. These escaped the observations of 

 Siebold, for he says, " Nach meine Beobachtungen bestehen die Gregarinen 

 aus einer 'harten glatten den Eihiilleu der Insekten-Eir ahnlichen Haut."t 

 The movements of the animal are exceedingly sluggish, and consist of a very 

 slow bending in any direction of any part of the inferior cell, most usually 

 above the middle, rarely at the inferior extremity, but most frequently near 

 the superior cell which is entirely passive. The superior cell is also frequently 

 drawn or contracted within the inferior, and again protruded by the con- 

 traction of the latter, and the propulsion of the granular contents against it. 

 The inferior cell is also frequently, more especially in younger individuals, in- 

 tussuscepted within itself through a partial contraction ; and again relieved 

 by a general contraction of the cell. wall.

In the state in which Gregarina is found, it would probably hold a rauk be- 

 tween the Trematoda and Trichina the lowest of the Nematoidea. 



Njjctotherus,* a new genus of Polygastrica, allied to Plesconia. — Body ovate, 

 dilated posteriorly, compressed anteriorly, granulated, longitudinally lined, 

 with an apparent operculum covering its anterior half, and having a semi-circle 

 of cilia just within its margin inferiorly and posteriorly. Centre of the oper- 

 culated portion furnished with a large trapezoidal finely granular areola. Pos- 

 terior part of the body with a short fissure passing inwards and downwards. 



NycMherus velor. — Body white, ovate, conoidal, anterior margin rounded, 

 obtuse ; posteriorly acute. Posterior margin of the apparent operculum passing 

 in a curved line upwards upon the middle of the bo'Iy to within a short distance 

 of the back, and furnished inferiorly with a point projecting backwards. With a 

 line passing down from the back about the middle of the operculum of the trape- 

 zoidal areola, giving the part of the body anterior to this the appearance of a 

 head. Trapezoidal areola, with curved sides, finely granular. Posterior fissure 

 communicating with the exterior, just above the acute termination of the body, 

 and passing inwards and downwards, resembles an anal aperture. Areolae of 

 the interior sarcous mass generally minute, one large and round pretty con- 

 stantly to be observed at the inner termination of the posterior fissure. 



Length from l-254th to l-80th in. ; breadth from l-320th to l-254th in. 



Habitat. — Commencement of the large intestine of Julus marginatus, often 

 found in considerable numbers. 



Remarks. — This genus is closely allied to Plesconia, but possess no appendages 

 excepting the semi-circle of cilia, just within the edge of the apparent operculum. 



The animal swims in water with great ease and grace. After being in this 

 fluid some time, the external investment bursts, and allows the protrusion of 

 globular masses of sarcous matter, as in Leucophrys, but not to such a great 

 extent. 



Note. — Since the above went to press, Dr. Leidy announced to the Academy 

 that he had discovered two new species of the entophyte Enterobrus; one of them 

 E. spiralis, l-69th inch long, growing in the small intestine of Julus pusillus ; 

 the other, E. attenuatus, l-24th inch long, growing more or less profusely with a 

 second species ofCladophytum, C. clavatum, in the ventriculus of a coleopterous 

 insect, Passalus cornutus. Thus has been established the law "that plants 

 may grow in the interior of the healthy animal as a normal condition, ' ' and a 

 new field has been presented for the investigation of the Cryptogamo-naturalist.

A letter wa.s read from Mr. Caspar Parkinson, dated Philadelphia, 

 Oct. 23d, 18-K>, ofForiug for sale a collection of Marine Shells. 



Dr. Leiily made the following ob.servations on tlie characters and 

 intimate wtructure of the odoriferou>< ^'lunds of the luvertebratu. 



Nature has supplied most or all animals with some means of defence or protec- 

 tion, through whicli their destruction is rendered limited. The character of suoh 

 means varies exceedingly, some are encased in hard armour, some ure endowed 

 with great muscular strength, some with great rapidity of movement, others trust 

 to their minuteness, some to their color, others feign death, many are furnished 

 with formidable instruments, such as teeth, claws, aculei, &c.; others are sup- 

 glied with organs which emit an odour so offensive that an aggressor is frequently 

 compelled to leave what otherwise would have been its victim, &c. It is to the 

 last mentioned organs to which I at present wish to direct, for a few moments, the 

 attention of the members : to the organs denominated odoriferous glands of ani- 

 mals. Bodies of tliis, or of a homologous character, are possessed by nearly all 

 animals, but they are not in all used as a means of defence. They give origin 

 to the odour which appears to be more or less peculiar to each species of animal, 

 and which probably is in some way connected with the sexual instinct. The 

 scent bag of the Moschus moschiferus is the homologue of the glandulae odori- 

 ferae Tysoni of the human prepuce ; the tegumentary mucous glands of mollusca, 

 of annelides, of fishes, the tegumentary glands of reptiles, the perspiratory and 

 sebaceous glands of birds, and of mammals, the odoriferous glands of insects, 

 the anal of carnivora, &c., are all probably of a homologous character. 



Although varying in the degree of their complexity in different animals, and 

 in the character of their secretion, yet the essential structure is the same through- 

 out. Consisting of tubes or follicles of basement membrane, their complexity 

 depends upon their greater or lesser length, their being simple or compound, 

 straight or more or less convoluted, and isolated or aggregated, in connection 

 with the mode of supplying to them their nutritive fluid. 



On the interior these cavities or tubes are covered with a single layer of 

 nucleolo-nucleated organic cells, the true elaborators or manufacturers of the 

 secreted matters of the glandular bodies. 



The secreted matter varies exceedingly in its properties in different animals ; 

 in odor being found from that of the perspiratory fluid of man, through a great 

 variety of shades, to that most powerful and odious of all odours, the secre- 

 tion of the anal glands of the Mephitis Americana ; in consistence from a semi- 

 fluid state to the gaseous fluid of the Brachinus crepitans, &c. It is this which 

 constitutes the material contained within the organic cells intermediate to the 

 cell wall and the nucleus. 



The cell wall and nucleus are the agents in connection with the organic 

 force which produce or elaborate the contained matter. And, indeed, this is the 




1849.] 235 



ultimate fact of all organization ; for all the innumerable objects of living nature, 

 with such variety of form, composition, and color, from the simplest to the most 

 complex : from the vibrionic filament to the noble oak, from the bodo, or monas, 

 up to man, are the result of a force in connection with an amorphous 

 vesicle, the organic cell-wall, with the contained nucleus. Wonderful, in- 

 deed, is it that the human mind at length has been enabled to penetrate so 

 deeply into the mysteries of nature as to discover the starting point of 

 life, the stile at which an invisible intangible cause operates in the production 

 of all those beings we call organized. From this digression I return once more 

 to the consideration of the odoriferous glands. In many of the higher animals, 

 the structure of these have been carefully investigated, but not to the same ex- 

 tent in the lower animals. 



In Hemipterous insects these bodies are situated within the posterior part of 

 the metathorax or anterior part of the abdomen, and consists of one or two, more 

 or less long and convoluted coeca, which open exteriorly, usually between the 

 00X36 of the middle and posterior legs. 



In the carnivorous Coleoptera they are situated in the posterior part of the 

 abdomen, on each side of the rectum, and usually open exteriorly upon the 

 membrane, connecting the inferior and superior plate of the last abdominal 

 segment on each side of the anal aperture. They generally consist of a number 

 of follicles, which converge to one or more ducts, which join the neck of a reser- 

 voir for containing the secreted Huid. A number of these are figured in the An- 

 nales des Sciences Naturelles for 1826. 



In the genus of Myriapoda, Julus, the ordoriferous glands are placed upon 

 each side of the body, every segment which has a double pair of legs possess- 

 ing a pair of the glands, commencing anteriorly with the sixth segment, ex- 

 cepting the head, and terminating posteriorly with the penultimata segment. 

 As the number of segments of the animal varies with its age, so will also the 

 number of the odoriferous glands. The adult Julus marginatus has usually fifty 

 pairs, the Julus maximus, from New Grenada, S. A., has fifty-eight pairs, &c. 



The orifices of these glands opening exteriorly correspond to a row of minute 

 black dots on each side of the body, situated about midway between the supe- 

 rior and inferior median line. 



The glands of Julus consist of a globular body or sac, with an elongated coni- 

 cal neck, and resembles in form a florence flask with the mouth drawn to a 

 point. In Julus marginatus they measure 1^^ lines long, the body being | of a 

 line in diameter. In structure they consist of an amorphous transparent base- 

 ment membrane covered upon the interior surface with a single layer of secre- 

 ting cells. The cells are polygonal, from mutual pressure, measure l-lG12th 

 inch in diameter, and are filled with a yellowish fluid, and a fine purplish 

 granular matter, which in mass gives them a dark purple color, and which, in 

 the aggregate of the cells, gives the glands a very deep purple or almost black 

 color. When the cells are compressed, or the contents pressed out, the gra- 

 nules exhibit lively molecular movement. 



In the centre of the mass of granular matter of the cell, and only seen upon 

 compressing the latter, is a round, translucent nucleus, measuring the l-5000th 

 inch in diameter, and containing a minute refractive nucleolus. 



The secreting cells vary in color in different insects, and in the aggregate give 




236 [Oct. 



the color to tho glandular bodies. The reservoir also is lined with cells. In Upis 

 Penusylvanica they are brownish, or nearly colorless, measure the l-7!iOlh inch 

 in diameter, contain some finely granular brownish matter, and a large round 

 or oval, translucent, faintly granular nucleus, measuring l-1250th inch, with 

 a large, round or oval nucleolus l-'ii7'27th inch in diameter. 



The secretion of the glands of Julus marginatus contained within the interior 

 of the body, is deep yellow in color, and contains a f<jw of the purplish granules 

 of the cells. It resembles oil in consistence, but is soluble in waterand alcohol. 

 It is neither acid nor alkaline, evaporates at a temperature of 250" F., without 

 residue; is acrid to the tongue; Schneiderian membrane, and conjunctiva, 

 smells like iodohydric acid, and stains the cuticle brown. The last two proper- 

 ties led me to suspect the existence of iodine, but the usual reagents prt*sented 

 none. It probably belongs to a class of peculiar organic compounds, found in 

 the odoriferous principles of animals, not yet investigated. 



Exteriorly the reservoirs of the odoriferous glands of insects are furnished 

 with transverse muscular bands, of a brownish color, about l-1578th inch in 

 breadth, and separated by wide intervals. 



In Julus, the body of the glands posesses no distinct muscular bands, but 

 the neck is provided with them.

By John Casein. 

 Genus Htdropsalis, Wagle.r, Isis, 1832, page 1222. 

 1. Hydropsalis limbatus, nobis. 



Adult 5 ^- Form. Wings long, pointed, with the shafts of the primaries 

 strong and slightly curved ; first primary longest, second and third deeply 

 sinuated on their outer webs, and, with the first, having their external margins 

 distinctly serrated. Tail excessively long, graduated, the two external feathers 

 surpassing the next by about 14 inches ; others regularly receding to the two 

 in the middle, which are shortest. Tarsi feathered slightly below the knee. 

 Webs of outer tail feathers narrow. 




1849.] 237 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin, from the tip of bill to end of tail about 2 

 feet 5 inches, of the wing 9 inches, of the tail to end of external feathers, abuut 

 22 inches; length of two middle tail feathers about 3 inches. 



Colors. — Upper surface of the head, body and wing coverts brownish black, 

 spotted and sparingly lined with pale fulvous. The wing coverts with round 

 spots at their points of the same color. 



Superciliary region grayish white, every feather having narrow irregular lines 

 of black. Hind neck with a semicollar of bright and reddish fulvous. Under 

 the eye an irregular whitish stripe. 



Scapular feathers with their external webs black, with a few curved lines of 

 fulvous remote from the tip, which is broadly margined with black, internal 

 webs of scapulars nearly white irregularly striped and spotted with black ; other 

 scapulars nearly black, with pale fulvous margins externally. 



Throat before with a white collar. Chin, breast and belly irregularly mixed 

 with brownish black and pale yellowish white, the latter color assuming upon 

 the breast the form of semicircular segments and lunular spots upon the tips of 

 the feathers, and the former (blackish) disposed to form very irregular narrow 

 bands upon the flanks and belly ; ventral region and under tail coverts paler. 



Quills brownish black, having upon their internal webs four or five narrow 

 transverse lines of pale yellowish white, conspicuous when viewed from below; 

 and upon their external webs (except the first) several rounded or irregular 

 shaped spots of the same color. Second and third quills were sinuated upon 

 their outer webs, with a very slight margin of white. Secondaries obscurely 

 tipped with whitish. 



First, second and third tail feathers throughout their whole length with their 

 outer webs and about two-thirds of their inner webs brownish black, — other por- 

 tion of the inner webs, being the internal margin of those feathers, white ; a 

 few bright fulvous spots near the base upon the outer webs. Fourth and fifth 

 tail feathers with similar colors, but more broadly bordered with white, which 

 upon those, as well as the third, is sparingly spotted with brownish. 



Young 9? Form. — Tail deeply emarginate, but rot excessively long, exter- 

 nal feathers exceeding the next by about 1^- inches only. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin, from tip of bill to end of tail about 12 

 inches, wing 8 inches, tail to end of external feathers 7^ inches; length of mid- 

 dle tail feathers about 3^ inches. 



Colors. — Entire upper surface, tail included, brownish black, with numerous 

 rounded spots and lines of reddish fulvous, assuming upon the tail the form of 

 irregular or curved bands, which are more or less mottled and mixed with the 

 brownish black of the other predominating portion. Throat with a semi-collar 

 of yellowish white. Entire under parts, brownish-black, banded and spotted 

 with fulvous. 



Hab. — South America. 



Obs. — This very remarkable species may readily be distinguished by its very 

 long forked tail, the feathers of which are irregularly graduated. In the latter 

 respect it differs from the Ilyd. psalurus, (Temm.) to which, however, it bears 

 but little resemblance. 



There are in the collection of the Academy three specimens of this species, 

 two males in the Rivoli collection, and a female which was fortunate!^ pro- 

 cured in Paris by Mr. Edward Wilson.

2. Ili/dropxaUs seffmenlahit nobis. 



^ tiiidille age ? Form. Wings moderate, second primary slightly loiij^est 

 second, third and fourth deeply sinuated on their outer webs; first with its 

 outer edges serrated, inner edges (of primaries) presenting a fringed appearance. 

 Shaft:j of primary quill.s strong and curved. 



Tail very long, the two external feathers of which surpass the next by about 

 10 to 12 inches; second, third and fourth graduated; fourth and Gfih about 

 equal — that is to say, the four middle feathers of the tail nearly equal. 



Bill rather long and slender. Tarsi b.ire, plendcr. Webs of outer tail fea- 

 thers very narrow. 



Dimensionn. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 20 

 inches, wing Gj, tail to eud of external feathers about 15^ inches; length of 

 four middle tail feathers about 4 inches. 



Colors. — Upper surface of head, body, scapulars and wing coverts brownish- 

 black, ppotted and obscurely lined with ferruginous rufous, which color almost 

 predominates upon the scapulars. 



Neck, behind, with an obscure ferruginous semi-collar, before, with a semi- 

 collar of rufous white. Body beneath, brownish black, with rounded ferrugin- 

 ous spots upon the breast, and upon the belly with obscure bands and spots of 

 pale ferruginous and nearly white. 



Wing feathers brownish-black; first primary with a narrow pale reddish bor- 

 der upon its outer web for about half its length, second and third with a pale 

 ferruginous spot at the point of sinuation. Secondaries with irregular bare 

 of reddish and with narrow tips of the same color. 



The two external feathers of the tail with their shafts white upon the upper 

 surface, outer webs white, tinged with rufous, and handsomely marked (upon the 

 outer webs) with semicircular segments of black, having for their bases the shaft 

 of the feather. This marking is more conspicuous towards the base, and upon 

 the under surface the black color of these semicircular segments extends to the 

 shaft of the feather. All the other tail feathers brownish black, with bars of fer- 

 ruginous rufous ; upon the two middle feathers these bars are mottled with black. 



Young $? Form. — Tail ample, emarginate, and regularly graduated, the 

 two external feathers being but little longer than the second. 



DmeMioTis. — Total length of skin, from tip of skin to end of tail about 9 

 inches ; wing 6J ; tail to end of external feathers, about 5 inches ; length of 

 middle feathers of the tail, about 4 inches. 



Colon. — Entire plumage very similar to the male, but with all the tail feather? 

 brownish black, barred with ferruginous. 



Hub. Bogata, New Grenada. 



06s. The two specimens now described belong to the Rivoli collection, and 

 have the appearance of being either young birds, or with the plumage of winter. 

 The male may, however, be easily reco^'nized by the curious marks upon the 

 external webs of the outer tail feathers, described above. The colors in the 

 present specimens, black and ferruginous, are peculiar to this species, so far 

 as I have seen. 



Genus Antbostomcs, Gould. 



3. Antrostomus serico-caudatis, nobis. 



Adult cj'. Form. Wings rather long, third primary longest ; second, third 




1849.] 239 



and fourth sinuated on their outer webs ; shafts slightly curved. Tail cuneiform, 

 four middle feathers equal and longest. 



Bill rather long and flat ; tarsi short, slightly feathered below the knee. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin, from tip of bill to end of tail, about 11 

 inches ; wing 7^ ; tail 5| inches. 



Colors. Head above, back, rump, scapulars and wing coverts variegated with 

 black and dark fulvous, the latter in rounded spots and narrow irregular lines, 

 predominating upon the wing coverts, but the former (black) upon the head and 

 scapulars. This color disposed to form a broad longitudinal band on the head. 

 Sides of the head, over the eyes, grayish ; every feather with transverse black 

 lines. Neck behind with a semi-collar of deep reddish fulvous ; before, with a 

 semi-collar of yellowish white, the feathers of which are tipped with black. 



Throat nearly black, breast below the collar, with deep fulvous spots and irre- 

 gular lines, belly and ventral region with a predominating pale fulvous white, 

 and some nearly pure white spots, every feather transversely lined and barred 

 with black, under tail coverts fulvous, unspotted. 



Wing feathers brownish black, primaries with about 10 to 12 irregular shaped 

 but rather triangular marks of deep fulvous upon their external webs, second- 

 aries with irregular bars of pale fulvous, which bars are mottled with black. 



First, second and third feathers of the tail brownish black with several obscure 

 and badly defined bands of reddish fulvous, and obliquely tipped in a very con- 

 spicuous manner, with fine, silky white. Fourth feather of similar color, and 

 without the white tip, and with the reddish fulvous bands more definite. Two 

 middle tail feathers brownish black, and with about 10 to 12 bars on each web 

 of deep reddish fulvous, well defined, and which are disposed obliquely from the 

 shafts of the feathers, like a pinnate leaf, those bars broad and mottled with 

 black, — two middle feathers without white tips. 



Younger? Form. As above described, but with the second primary slightlv 

 the longest. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to the end of tail, about 104- 

 inches, wing 1\, tail 5i inches. 



Colors. Y&TY similar to the above, but with the grayish color extending over 

 the whole of the head. Under parts much darker but with more numerous 

 white rounded spots. Under tail coverts fulvous with black lines. The fine 

 white tips of the external tail feathers tinged with fulvous. 



Hab. South America. 



Obs. The distribution of the colors upon the upper surface of the bodr in 

 this handsome species resembles in some degree that of Scolopax rusticola or of 

 iS. minor. 



It is not similar to anj other species known to me, and can at once be recog- 

 nized by the silky white tips of the external tail feathers. These cross the fea- 

 thers obliquely, and are so arranged that when the cuneiform tail is expanded 

 they form a contiguous margin upon the ends of those three feathers. 



This is one of the few species of this family which have pretensions to beauty. 

 Two specimens are in the collection of the Academy.

 Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



The Corresponding Secretary read a letter from Dr. T. Romeyn 

 Beck, dated Albany, October 24, 1849, acknowledging, on behalf of 

 the Trustees of the New York State Library, the receipt of Nos. 9 and 

 10, Vol. 4, of the Proceedings of the Academy. 



Also, a letter from Francis Peyro Porcher, M. D., dated Charles- 

 ton, S. C, October 1, 1849, acknowledging the receipt of his notice of 

 election as a Correspondent. 



Also, a letter from the Secretary of the Western Academy of 

 Natural Sciences, dated Cincinnati, October, 1849, acknowledo-ing 

 the receipt of the last number of the Proceedings. 



The Recording Secretary read a letter addressed to Dr. Morton, by 

 Mr. Richard H. Kern, a member of this Institution, dated Santa Fe 

 New Mexico, 1849, giving an interesting account of his recent Ethnolo- 

 gical and Archaeological exploration in New Mexico. 



Dr. Bridges presented a paper by Dr. R. W. Gibbes, of South Caro- 

 lina, entitled " New species of Myliobatea from the Eocene of South 

 Carolina, with other genera not heretofore observed in the United 

 States." Referred to Drs. Bridges, Mojton and Leidy. 



Dr. Leidy made some remarks upon several new species of Ento- 

 phyta, Enterobrus spiralis, and E. attenuatum, and a new species of 

 Gregarina, discovered by him. 



On leave granted. Dr. Bridges offered a resolution to appoint a com- 

 mittee to enquire into the expediency of appropriating the room ad- 

 joining the Library for the purpose of the same, and also what altera- 

 tions may be necessary, and to report to the Academy at next meeting. 



The resolution was adopted, and a committee appointed consisting 

 of Drs. Bridges, Zantzinger and Wilson. 



On motion of Mr. Cassin, it was resolved, that the Committee on 

 Proceedings be authorized to complete the copy of the Proceedings for 

 the Western Academy of Natural Sciences. 



November IBth. 



Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



A letter was read, dated Niirnberg, July 24, 1849. from Messrs. 

 Frederick and J. W. Stiirm, announcing the decease of their father 

 Jacob Stiirm, a correspondent of the Academy. Also requestino- an 

 exchange of publications with the Society. 



Dr. Hallowell remarked that recently, a living specimen of the serpent des- 

 cribed in a former number of the Proceedings as Coluber venustus, was brought 

 to the Academy by Dr. Watson, and gave birth to seven young, the animal being

 specimens tluTC arc three spots ; in tiie others they coalesce more or less, in ono 

 of them forming a narrow irregulHr white band, the animal resembling very much

The Chairman also remarked, that the Charib Skull, deposited by 

 him this evening, had been obtained in the island of Nassau, by the 

 late llev. Thomas Leaver, from whom it wa.s derived Ijy Dr. T. C 

 Deans, of Newport, 11. 1., who presented it to Dr. Morton. 



On leave granted, the Committee appointed at last meeting, to en- 

 quire into the expediency of altering the room adjoining the Library, 

 80 as to adapt it to the purposes of the same, made a report, embracing 

 the details of a plan for the object proposed, and recommending that 

 authority be given for an immediate commencement of the work. 



The report was adopted, and the Committee instructed to carry out 

 the plan as described.

The Corresponding Secretary read a letter from Mr. J. M. McMinn, 

 dated Milesburg, Centre County, Pennsylvania, addressed to Dr. Zant- 

 zinger, containing the following : — 



" I send you some specimens of our ' Snow bug.' This insect occurs in great 

 numbers on the mountains of Pennsylvania. I have frequently noticed them in 

 mid-winter on the snow, but I never saw such a multitude ol them together, as I 

 witnessed on the 17th of February, 1849, near the "Rattle Snake," on the Alle- 

 ghany Ridge. The snow was entirely covered for the fourth of a mile along the 

 road, and several rods on either side. The mercury in F. was standing at about 

 15 degrees; the atmosphere was dry and clear. 



These little animals were quite stupid, and to all appearance had been but a 

 short time there, and as it was about 9 o'clock in the morning, I judged that they 

 arrived in the night. 



Their motion was slow, and those on the top were quietly endeavoring to get 

 under. They did not appear to be eating any thing. The weather was too cold 

 to remain and watch their movements, and the next day, when I again passed the 

 spot, I could not detect a vestige of them. 



The wind had been strong from the north for several days, and I have noticed 

 that we had strong north winds whenever I had seen them." 



A letter was read from the Librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, 

 dated Washington, November 1, 1849, acknowledging the receipt of

Habitat. — Grows from the mucous membrane of the small intestine of Julus 

 pusillus. 



Remarks. — This species is found in varying quantity from a half dozen in- 

 dividuals up to fifty or more of various ages. The specimens of Julus pusilhis 

 from which the plant was obtained, measured half an inch in length. 



Enterobrus attenuatus. Faintly brownish, yellowish, or hyaline, forming a

Remark'. — Tliis itj a vory i^rnceful form, and \» more digposod to s'row in 

 liUiicheH or clodo togethor, than tliu other npeciea. I have not met with it 

 with the terminal two cells in twelve specimenB of rajisalus, which oontainod 

 over a hundred of the plants, although from Home of the individuals appearing 

 truncated at the di«tal extremity, I think it probable that they may occur ; 

 otherwise it would form a distinct genus. 



Cladophytum ramnsisnimum. Filaments very long, very delicate, and very 

 much branched, j^rowing in fasciculi of moderate density from granular in asses. 



Length l-TSth in.; thickness of j»rincii)al filaments or trunks l-irifcoth in. 



Jlabitat. — Growing in moderate profuseness from the nni'-oiis ni'Miilirane of 

 Passalus comutus. 



New Genus. Cobysotladl's* 



Filaments hyaline, inarticulate, very compound ; branches thicker than the 

 trunk, clavate, without ramuli, growing from rounded or oval granular masses. 



Corynocladusradiatus. Comatose, growing in very dense bunches, occasionally 

 straggling ; branches spreading, terminal ones very long, simple, clavate, 

 l-150th in. long. 



Length 1-lOOth in., diameter of trunk 1-10,000 in., branches l-600th in. 



Uabitat. — Growing profusely in the ventriculus of Passalus comutus, from 

 the mucous membrane. 



Now Genus. CHTPTODESMA.f 



Filaments ribbou-like, growing from attached granular masses. Consisting of 

 a single cell, with a very delicate cell wall, and minute granular contents. 



C. tenuis. Filaments hyaline, compressed, attenuated at both extremities, 

 growing in'dense bunches from rounded granular masses. Cell wall very thin 

 and delicate, granular contents of cell very fine and indistinct, measuring from 

 l-10,000th in. to l-(j000tli in., with a few coarser granules, and occasionally a 

 few globules, measuring 1-I875th in. 



Dimensions. Length of lilaments l-500th in. to l-75th in.; greatest breadth 

 l-1700th in. 



Habitat. — Grows in profusion from the mucous membrane of the ventriculus 

 of Passalus comutus. 



Besides the foregoing, I have found numerous free or floating entophj'ta in the 

 contents, usually of the posterior part of the alimentary can;d, in mammalia, 

 aves, reptilia, pisces, mollusca, insecta, &c. These, at present, I do not feel at 

 liberty to describe as new or particular, from my want of acquaintance with 

 cryptogamic botany. A number of them, I have no doubt, if not peculiar, at 

 least continue to grow luxuriantly in the intestinal canal ; such are various 

 Jlycoderma, &c.; others very probably are swallowed with the food, and pass 

 from the intestinal canal unchanged. Numerous drawings of these I exhibit to 

 the Academy, and propose leaving them to future investigation, or to the con- 

 sideration of cryptogamic botanists, being a field well worthy of their researches. 

 I also have a number of others, the character of which is peculiarly entophytic : 

 but these I have not yet studied out nor figured, but hope to present descrip- 

 tions of them to the Academy in a very short time.

The Recording Secretary read the following report : 



REPORT 

 OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



For 1848, '49. 



As there is no Report of the Recording Secretary for the year 1848 entered 

 upon the Minutes of the Academy, it will be proper to 'give a short account of 

 the Transactions of the Society during the last two years. 



There were elected, during 1848, fourteen Resident Members and twenty-five 

 Correspondents ; and during 1849, eight Resident Members and six Corres 

 pondents. la the former year a corrected list of the Members and Correspon- 

 dents was published, which comprises 102 Life Members, and 143 Members 

 paying annually: of these, 63 are deceased; and 518 Correspondents, of whom 

 85 are deceased. Since the publication of the list, one member has resigned, 

 and another, Benjamin J. Kern, M. D., is deceased. 



From October, 1847, to the end of the last year, besides numerous minor com- 

 munications, there have been fifty principal ones made to the Academy and 

 published in its Proceedings, as follows : in General Natural History, one by Dr- 

 Morton, two by Dr. Hallowell, two by Dr. Bachman, one by Dr. Michel, two by 

 Dr. Keller, and ten by Dr. Leidy ; in Mammalogy, one by Dr. Gambel : in Orni- 

 thology, ten by Mr. Cassin, two by Dr. Gambel, and one by Major McCall ; in 

 Herpetology, four by Dr. Hallowell ; in Palaeontology, one by Mr. Lea and three 

 by Dr. Leidy; in Conchology, two by Mr. Conrad; in Entomology, three by 

 Mr. Haldeman, one by Miss Morris, two by Dr. Savage, and one by Mr. Daw- 

 son ; in Botany, one by Mr. Nuttall ; and in Geology, one by Mr. Pease. 



With the beginning of 1848, a new series of the Journal of the Academy, in 

 quarto form, was commenced, and to it, during the past two years, there have been 

 twenty-seven articles contributed, as follow : in General Natural History, one by 

 Dr. Morton, one by Dr. Meigs, and tVo by Dr. Leidy ; in Ornithology, five by Mr. 

 Cassin and two by Dr. Gambel ; in Herpetology, one by Prof. Baird ; in Concholo- 

 gy, two by Mr. Conrad ; in Entomology, two by Mr. Haldeman and two by Dr. 

 Le Conte ; in Botany, one by Mr. Nuttall ; and in Palaeontology, four by Dr. 

 Gibbes, two by Mr. Conrad, one by Mr. Tuomey, and one by Prof. Owen. The 

 publication of the Journal hereafter will be much assisted by an annual income 

 derived from a legacy of two thousand dollars, bequeathed for that purpose to 

 the Academy in 1848, by the late Mrs. Elizabeth Stott, of this city. 



During the same year the following amendment was made to the By-Laws, 

 viz.: " Chap. VIII. Art. IX. The Museum of the Academy shall be open to the 

 gratuitous admission of the public on the afternoons of Tuesday and Friday from 

 one o'clock until sunset." And during the last year the following amendment, 

 viz.; " Chap. VI. Art. I. There shall be fifteen standing committees, viz. — 

 1, The Ethnological Committee; 2, the Committee on Comparative Anatomy 

 and General Zoology ; 3, Committee on Mammalogy ; 4, on Ornithology ; 5, on 

 Herpetology and Ichthyology ; 6, on Conchology ; 7, on Entomology ; 8, on 

 Botany ; 9, on Palaeontology ; 10, on Geology and Mineralogy ; 11, on Physics ; 

 12, on the Library ; 13, on the Proceedings ; 14, the Auditors; each^o consist 




252 



[Dec. 



of three members ; and 1j, the Publication Committee, to consist of five mem- 

 bers ; whose term of service ahull be one year. And all these, except the 

 Auditors and Publication Committee, shall be elected at the last meeting in 

 January of each year." 



After those alterations, a new edition of the Act of Incorporation and By-Laws 

 was published by order of the Academy. 



With these few statistics, etc. of the transactions of the Academy, the Secre- 

 tary will conclude by stating, that the Society was never in a more flourishing 

 condition tlian at present, as is plainly indicated in its published Proceedings. 

 The Library and Museum have received, and continue to receive, constant large 

 and valuable additions, as may be seen upon referring to the reports of the 

 Librarian and Curators.

In presenting the annual report on the state of the Library, the Librarian again 

 embraces the opportunity afforded him, of congratulating the Society on the 

 continued advancement which his department has made in the present year.

Of these, there were derived from authors 68 ; from editors 25 ; from mem- 

 bers, correspondents, &c. 150 : from Societies and Corporations 59 ; from Dr. 

 Wilson 1158 ; making an aggregate of 1460 additions to the Library in 1849. 



The additions in 1847 amounted to 1072 ; in 1848 to 1349, and in the present 

 year exceeding the last by 111. 



With one exception these have been the most prosperous years for the Library 

 since the foundation of the Institution. In these three years the additions have 

 amounted to 3881 ; of which, 2773 are due to Dr. Wilson, and the remainder, 

 1103, have been derived from other sources. 



The Librarian has renewed gratification in calling attention to the continued 

 liberality during the year of Dr. Wilson. The Library has always received a 

 large share of the interest and zeal which this gentleman has steadily manifested 

 for the Institution, and the results have been recorded on our minutes almost 

 weekly for several years past, in the long list of varied, well selected, and 

 highly practical works which he has placed upon its shelves. 



Until within a short period, these works have been entrusted to the Society 

 for the benefit of the members, without other restrictions than such as its rules, 

 and a due regard for the property, required. Dr. Wilson has, however, thought 

 proper to convert this splendid collection from a deposit into a donation, and I 

 have now the pleasure of announcing to the Society that we shall soon be in 

 possession of the whole collection, on the single condition that the use of the 

 works be restricted to the Hall : none of them, therefore, will be loaned from 

 the Hall on any pretext whatever. The numerous works in Mineralogy and 

 Geology, Entomology, Herpetology and Ichthyology, Conchology, Botany, 

 General Natural History, Mammalogy, Voyages and Travels, and the Periodicals 

 have already been presented. The remainder will follow as the time and leisure 

 of the donor will admit of his preparing the lists. 



Among the additions this year are a number of works on Conchology, obtained 

 by'purchase with the proceeds of the sale of several copies of Say's Conchology, 

 for which latter the Society is indebted to the liberality of Mrs. Lucy W. Say, 

 by whose instructions the fund is thus appropriated. We are under obligations 

 also this year, to Professor Agassiz, for a donation of numerous quarto volumes 

 of the Transactions of two Swiss Natural History Societies ; and to our venerable 

 President, William Hembel, Esq., for a valuable and scarce work in 41 vols. 8vo. 

 the Transactions of the London Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manu- 

 factures and Commerce. Dr. Wilson's donation of the Transactions of the Royal 

 Society of London complete from the origin of the publication in 1665, to the 

 middle of 1849, in 119 quarto vols., with the abridgement of the same, from 1665 

 to 1800, in 18 quarto vols., by Hutton, Shaw and Pearson, has been received with 

 the highest gratification by the members. 



In the last report, it was stated that further accommodations for the Books 

 would soon be required, the space in the present apartment becoming rapidly 

 occupied. This necessity has since greatly increased, and, in consequence a 

 plan has been submitted to the Society, and received its sanction, for adapting 

 one of the adjoining rooms to the purposes of a Library. The floor of this room , 

 and that of the entry beyond, will be lowered to a level with the present 

 Library, and laid on iron joist, with intervening brick arches, and a gallery.con- 

 atructed similar to, and communicating with, that in the same. The work will 




'^^^ [Dec, 



he conirncnccil forthwith, and will be completed in a few weeks. The building, 

 with the exception of one room, will then be perfectly fire-proof. When this 

 improvement hns been finished, and a new arrangement and -listribution of the 

 Library made, the exact No. of vols. Ac. in each department, with the aggregate, 

 which it wa.'; intended to have appended to the present report, will be made 

 known to the Society. 



Wm. S. Z.\KTZISOEn, 



llalloftheA'rademy, Dec. 25, 18)0. Librarian. 



Dr. Leidy, Chairman of the Curators, read the annual report as fol- 

 lows : 



REPORT 



OF THE CURATORS 



For 1849. 



It is with much pleasure the Curators, in presenting their Annual Report, can 

 say that the collections of the Academy, during the year 1849, have increased to 

 such an extent as to be indicative of a continuance of the extraordinary prosperity 

 which it enjoyed the two preceding years. Most of the departments have been 

 enriched through donation and deposit, with many rare and valuable objects. 



Since the presentation of the last report of the Curators, there has been con- 

 structed a line of horizontal, centrally vertical, double cases, down the centre of 

 the Hall, for the further accommodation of the pala-ontological collection; a 

 large, deep, horizontal, double case at the east end of the same, for the reception 

 of the larger specimens of organic remains; a line of horizontal cases on the 

 outside of the railing of the lower gallery, on each side of the Hall, for contain- 

 ing the Oological collection ; and several vertical cases, occupying the landing 

 of the stair-case in the south-east corner, for the extension, of the Ornithological 

 collection. 



A short account of the increase in the Museum during the past year we give 

 under the head of each department. 



Mammulogi/. — In this department, during the past year, we have received 22 

 species of Mammalia, among which may be particularly mentioned the original 

 specimen, described by Dr. Harlan, of Chlamyphorus truncatus, a magnificent 

 albino deer, Cervus virginianus^ presented by Dr. Wilson, and a fine Ornitho- 

 rynchus paradoxus, presented by Dr. Michael. 



Ornithology. — A special report upon this extensive department of our Museum 

 has been prepared by Mr. Cassin, on which account it is unnecessary for us to 

 make any remark upon it, except that during the past year there have been added 

 to it, from other sources than Dr. Wilson, 61 species, 76 specimens of birds. 



In Oology we have been enriched by the deposit from Dr. Wilson of two very 

 large and celebrated collections of birds' eggs. The first of these is a general 

 and very extensive collection, made through a long period of time, and at great 

 expense and trouble, by M. 0. Des Murs, of Paris. This contains 1281 species, 

 2449 specimens, and 10 nests, of which 1041 species are determined. The 

 second is a collection of birds' eggs, exclusively of Australia, made by Mr. John 




1849.] 255 



Gould of London. It comprises 303 species, 976 specimens, and 33 nests, o.f 

 which 295 species are determined. 



In the latter collection of eggs are 58 species contained in the former ; deduct- 

 ing these, the number of species in the two collections amounts to 1526, of 

 which 1278 are determined. The whole number of specimens in the two col- 

 lections is 4425. 



When we consider the diflSciilty of obtaining and determining oological 

 specimens, the delicacy required in their preparation, and the care necessary 

 for their preservation in transportation, we may in some measure form an esti- 

 mate of the value of this rich deposit. 



Besides the above, we have received from several of the members 12 species 

 and 15 specimens of birds' eggs, and 9 species of nests. 



Herpetology and Ichthyology. — In the past year these collections were re- 

 moved, and rearranged upon the flying gallery of the east basement room. Du- 

 ring the same time we have received 20 species, 50 specimens of reptilia, and 

 8 species, 11 specimens of fishes, among the latter of which is a very beautiful 

 specimen of Lepidosteus ferox, Raf., from the Mississippi, presented by Mr- 

 J. D. Anderson, of New Orleans. 



Mollusca. — In this department, the donations during the past year are 

 unparalleled in America. To our generous and excellent fellow member. Dr. 

 R. E. Griffith, we owe lasting gratitude for the splendid gift of 4907 species, 

 over 12,000 specimens of shells, being the private collection made by this gen- 

 tleman at much cost and pains, during a long series of years. To Dr. T. B- 

 Wilson we are indebted, as ever, for the donation of 1707 species, over 3500 

 specimens of shells. 



These two collections comprise 5405 species, of which the odd 405 may be 

 cast off as duplicate, certainly not more, as we are informed by Dr. Griffith, who 

 is Chairman of the Conchological Committee, and is engaged in arranging this 

 department, which would leave a balance of 5000 different species. 



From the Australian Museum, in exchange, we received 111 species, 328 

 specimens, Australian, New Zealand, and South Sea Island shells. 



From various other sources 105 species, 204 specimens of shells, principally 

 presented by Mr. McAndrew, of England, Dr. Gould, of Boston, Mr. Thompson, 

 of Belfast, Ireland, and Mr. Watson, of S. Africa. 



Insecta, Crustacea, and Arachnida. — The Entomological cabinet has received 

 the addition of 200 species of insects, principally from Mr. Hagedorn, the Bava- 

 rian Consul, and in exchange from the Australian Museum. 



Of Crustacea there have been obtained, by exchange and presentation, 59 spe- 

 cies, 163 specimens, principally from M. E. Griffith, Mr. Thompson, of Belfast, 

 Ireland, and Dr. Wilson. 



Of Arachnida we obtained 2 species, 4 specimens of Scorpio. 



Radiata. — Of these we have received an unusually large number, viz., 112 

 species, 120 specimens, principally from Mr. Thompson in exchange ; the others 

 presented by different members of the society. Most of them are Echinodermata 

 and Polypi. 



Comparative Anatomy. — To this part of our Museum an extensive addition 

 has been made, through the liberality of our fellow-member Dr. P. B. Goddard, 

 consisting of 106 crania of mammalia, 30 do. birds, 4 do. reptiles, and 3 do. fishes ; 




256 [Dec. 



8 skeletons of ranmrnalia, 6 do. birds, and 2 do. reptiles ; and 21 otlier interest- 

 ing pieces in comparative anatomy. 



Dr. Wilson also extended this collection by the donation of 22Liounted skele- 

 tons of birds, principally Australian, and 5 other anatomical pieces. 



Besides the foregoing, there have been deposited and presented 39 other 

 crania and pieces, principally by Dr. Morton. 



Botaivj. — The herbarium has received the addition, through exchange and 

 donation, of IGO species of Cryptogamia. 



PahTontolif/y. — A large collection of organic remains has been added to the 

 Museum by Dr. Wilson, consisting of 658 species, 1552 specimens of British 

 fossils, many of which are very beautiful and rare. 



From other sources we have received 197 fossils, principally from Messrs. 

 Verreaux of Paris, Budd, McMinn and Morton. 



A inw weeks since our sister institution, the American Philosophical Society, 

 passed a resolution to deposit its Collection of Organic Remains with the 

 Academy. The large number of mammalian remains in this collection renders it 

 one of the most importaut deposits which has yet been made to our Museum. 

 When received, a more particular account of it will be given. 



Mhieralogy and Geology. — The cabinet of Mineralogy contains over 3700 

 labelled specimens, exclusive of rocks. During the past year there were re- 

 ceived 206 specimens, chiefly from Messrs. Moss, Verreaux and Wilson. 



We will finish this brief report by stating that the collections in all the de- 

 partments are, at the present time, in a good state of preservation, and are 

 gradually undergoing arrangement by the different committees. 



Joseph Leidt, 



December 2Jth, 1849. Chairman of Curators. 



Mr. Cassin, from the Curators, read the following special report on 

 the state of the Ornithological collection : 



At the request of the Chairman of the Curators of this Academy, the under- 

 signed begs leave to offer a Special Report upon the department of Ornithology 

 iu which, as Curator, he has been exclusively engaged. 



Having had the honor of submitting a report of a similar character at the 

 annual meeting in December 1847, I have now the pleasure of stating that the 

 following collections, which had been partly received or were about to be re- 

 ceived at that period, have arrived, and have been completely arranged in our 

 Ornithological Galleries, within the past two years ; viz. the very extensive col- 

 lection of the Prince Massena of Paris, the collection of Mr. Bourcier of Lyons, 

 Dr. Gambel's North American collection, and all the very valuable and interest- 

 ing collections obtained by purchase and exchange in Europe by Mr. Edward 

 Wilson; while of the Australian collection of the distinguished Ornithologist 

 Mr. Gould, about two-thirds of the birds, and the entire collection of nests and 

 eggs, have been received. The detention of the latter, has arisen from the fact 

 that it was found expedient to have the specimens mounted in Europe, the col- 

 lection having been /« skin at the time of purchase. 




1849.] 257 



It is perhaps unnecessary for me to again allude to the high scientific value of 

 these collections or to the excellent condition in which they have reached their 

 destination ; I may state merely that all have fully answered the expectations of 

 the gentlemen of this Academy, and have afforded great instruction and gratifica- 

 tion to Zoologists and admirers of Natural History from all sections of our coun- 

 try. I beg to add that the extensive collections formed in the cities of Europe, 

 expressly for this Society, by Mr. Edward Wilson, at the instance of his brother, 

 ©ur esteemed associate, Dr. Thomas B. Wilson, have proved to be of special inter- 

 est. These were intended to supply deficiencies in the already comprehensive col- 

 lections just named, an undertaking which appeared to me, I confess, very difiBcult 

 at least, if not hopeless, but Mr. Wilson's success haj been most remarkable. I 

 have frequently alluded to his specimens in the papers which I have had the honor 

 at various times of submitting to the Society ; it is sufficient to say further, that in 

 the course of my examinations of species, when I have found, as has often been 

 the case, a specimen in an unusual stage of plumage, or some odd looking variety, 

 serving the most useful purpose of illustration, it was pretty certain to turn out 

 to be one of Mr. Wilson's collecting. To him we are also indebted for several un- 

 described species, and a large number new to the collection. 



Our valued associate Mr. Edward Harris has presented to the Academy, during 

 the past year, his entire collection. This was formed during the long period of 

 his connection with Mr. Audubon, and embraces many specimens of the various 

 species described by the latter gentleman, and of many other rare or little known 

 American species ; in fact, never since the arrival of Dr. Townsend from the 

 Columbia river, in 1837, has a collection come into the possession of this Society 

 of a character so interesting to the student of North American Ornithology. 

 The peculiar character of Mr. Harris' collection will readily be perceived when 

 I state that it contains the original specimens of several of the species described 

 by Mr. Audubon, such as Quiscalus Breweri, Sturnella neglecta, Fringilla Har- 

 risii and Lincolnii, Alauda Spraguei, Emberiza Bairdii, and Yireo Belli, numer- 

 ous specimens of Emberiza pallida and grammaca, Fringilla aurocapilla, amcena 

 and Townsendii, Pica hudsonica and Nuttallii, Alauda rufa, Erythrospiza fron- 

 talis, Sturnella hippocrepis, Pipilo oregona and arctica, Hirundo thalassina 

 Sialia arctica and occidentalis, Tyrannula Saj'a. Parus melanotis, Troglodytes 

 brevirostris and obsoletus, Vermivora Tolmaei, Lophortix plumifera. Tetrao ob- 

 scurus and phasianellus, and many others equally difficult to obtain. 



I must specially mention, however, a series of no less than 25 specimens of 

 the intricately allied species of Colaptes. which inhabit our Western territory, 

 referable to C. auratus, raexicanus, and Ayresii, which illustrates the judiciou.s 

 manner in which Mr. Harris formed his collection, and is additional, though 

 unnecessary evidence of his excellent judgment in Ornithological science. 



The distinguished naturalist, Mr. J. J. Audubon, has presented the original 

 specimen of Caprimulgus Nuttallii, Aud., and Colaptes Ayresii, Aud., both of 

 which are valuable additions, and the former, as yet, an unique specimen of a 

 very remarkable species from California. 



A collection of Asiatic birds, and an extensive collection of nests and eggs, have 

 been presented by Professor Spencer F. Baird of Dickinson College. A collection 

 of nests and eggs being then about to be formed in connexion with our Ornitho- 

 logical collection, this donation was peculiarly acceptable, and evinces the con- 




258 [Dec. 



tinucd desire of this talented and occomplisbed joung naturalist to serve this 

 Academy. 



Will. Gambel, M. D., Ims presented numerous specimens, umong wliich are 

 suites of specimens of Merula minor (Gra.), Wilsonii (IJonap.), and olivaceus 

 (Giraud.), and other obscure American species ; in the study and elucidation of 

 which he has been eminently successful. 



A. L. Ilecrmann, M. D., has presented a large collection of eggs, collected by 

 him in Florida, and numerous specimens of birds from the same locality. Of the 

 latter I may enumerate as possessing especial interest, several specimens of Cy- 

 mindis hamatus. Less., Vireo longiro.stris, Sw., Thalasseus regius, Gambel, Ster- 

 nula frenatu, Gambel, ;ind also numerous specimens of Ardea rufescens, Gm., and 

 of Ardea I'ealei, Honap., representing various stages of plumage, and demonstra- 

 ting that the latter is a di.stinct species as originally described by Mr. Honaparte. 



W. S. Jones, M. D., of Riceboro, Georgia, has deposited the original and yet 

 unique specimen of Picus Lecontei, Jones, a curious little tridactyle species dis- 

 covered by him in Georgia, and possessing great interest as an addition to the 

 fauna of this country. 



Another addition to our fauna, the Anas RafiBesii. King, has been made this 

 year, by E. Pilate, M. D., of Opelousas, Louisiana, a specimen of which, being 

 the first ever observed within the limits of the United States, has been pre- 

 sented by him to this Society. 



A specimen of Strix flammea, Linn., from Western Africa, very interesting on 

 account of its locality, has been presented by our esteemed correspondent Mr. 

 George N. Lawrence, of New York. 



The Academy has also to acknowledge its indebtedness to Mrs. John B. Smith 

 of this city, for a beautiful specimen of Nycthemerus pictus, (Linn.); to C. 

 Wistar M. D., for an interesting specimen of a dwarf variety of the common 

 fowl" to Mr. William Ayr for a specimen of the Egretta alba, (Linn.) — to our 

 valued associate Mr. Samuel Ashmead for various specimens collected by him 

 at Cape May: to John G. Howard for two living specimens of Columbia 

 cyanocephala, Linn., brought by him from Cuba, expressly for the Academy, 

 and for other donations. 



One of the most remarkable as well as valuable additions recently made to 

 the Ornithological collection is the extensive collection of nests and eggs formed 

 by Mons. 0. des Murs, of Paris, author of the " Iconographie Ornithologique," 

 now in the course of publication, and well known as an Ornithologist. This 

 splendid collection, like nearly the whole of the present contents of our Orni- 

 thological galleries, came into possession of this Society through the influence 

 of Messrs. Thomas B. and Edward Wilson. It embraces no less than 3450 spe- 

 cimens, being the eggs of 1281 species, from all parts of the world, in very per- 

 fect condition, many of which are to be obtained only with great difficulty. 



I may be allowed to state in connexion with this subject, that Mr. Gould's 

 collection of eggs previously alluded to, contain 97G specimens, or 303 species. 

 The entire collection now in the Museum of the Academy, is but partially 

 arranged, but deducting duplicates, it may safely be estimated as containing the 

 eggs of about 1500 species, about 1200 of which are named. 



I consider it proper to state here, that in the arrangement of the collection re- 

 sultin<T from the combination of those above mentioned, the collection previously 




1849.] 259 



belonging to this Society has been carefully preserved. This will be found to 

 contain not only many specimens of rare scientific value, (such as the original 

 specimens of the species discovered by Dr. Townsend, many rare Mexican species 

 from Dr. Burrough, and the fine Surinam collection from Dr. Bering) but also 

 many highly prized mementoes of the friends and associates of our Society, to 

 whose kind exertions the formation of the nucleus of our present extensive col- 

 lection is to be attributed, such as Dr. Marmaduke Burrough, Dr. Ralph Ham- 

 mersly, Mr. Thomas Ryan, Dr. George C. Leib, Dr. Wm. Blanding, Mr. Wm. Hem- 

 bel, Dr. W. S. W. Ruscbenberger, Dr. S. G. Morton, Dr. C. Hering, Dr. Jno. K. 

 Townsend, Mr. W. S. Warder, Dr. J. Trudeau, Dr. A. L. Heermann, Dr. E. A. 

 Abadie, Dr. C. Hufifnagle, Mr. Richard C. Taylor, Mr. J. W. Rulon, Dr. Gavin 

 Watson, Mr. Wm. S. Vaux, Dr. Thomas McEuen, Mr. John Speakman, Mr. A. 

 F. Darley, Mr. Geo. W. Carpenter, Mr. Thomas Fisher, Mr. W. A. Foster, Dr. P. 

 B. Goddard, Dr. C. W. Pennock, Mr. Robert Pearsall, Mr. J. Price Wetherill, 

 Dr. S. W. Woodhouse, Mr. Samuel Ashmead, Mr. John G. Bell, and manv 

 others. 



There is at present another large addition about being made to the collection 

 of which a few specimens have already arrived. It is a collection formed durino- 

 several years residence in the interior of India, by Captain Boys, of the British 

 Army, and contains about 1000 specimens, among which are many new and rare 

 objects. It is now in the hands of Mr. Gould, who wishes to make drawincsof 

 various specimens for his forthcoming work on the birds of Asia, and will pro- 

 bably arrive in the course of the ensuing year. 



There is also now in the possession of the Academy and intended for its 

 Museum, though not yet presented, a valuable collection made by our fellow 

 member Mr. E. L. Kern, who has been attached as artist to several of the expe- 

 ditions of Col. Fremont, and is now in California. This was collected by Mr. 

 Kern during the expedition of 1845, and contains numerous specimens of such 

 interesting species as Cathartes Californianus, Archibuteo regalis, Athene hypu- 

 gea, Nucifraga Columbiana and Cyanocephala, (De Weid), Picus scalaris and 

 melanopogon, Cyanocorax californicus and coronatus, Columba fasciata Frin- 

 gilla oregona, Paris minimus, septentrionalis and montanus, and many others. 



Arrangements for further additions have also been completed, which will en- 

 sure all attainable desiderata arriving in the cities of Paris and London and 

 arrangements for exchange or purchase have been completed or are now in 

 progress with several distinguished ornithologists, or with commercial natural- 

 ists in other parts of Europe ; and I may state in addition, that our Museum will 

 without doubt be further enriched by the researches of several of our members 

 who have availed themselves of facilities at present existing for visitincr Cali- 

 fornia ; among whom are Messrs. E. W. and R. H. Kern, who were attached to 

 the late unfortunate expedition of Col. Fremont, Dr. Heermann, Mr. J. G. Bell 

 and Dr. Gambel, and also by the acquisitions of one of our own most talented 

 and enterprising young naturalists Dr. S. W. Woodhouse, now absent upon a 

 government expedition to the Arkansas river. 



I am enabled to state that the number of specimens of birds actually exhibited 

 in the Museum of this Academy at the date of this Report, (Dec. 25th, 1849 ) is 

 nineteen thousand seven hundred and seventy-one (19,771). The number of 

 species cannot at present be ascertained, but I hope to present such information 




260 



[Dec. 



to the Society at the earliest possible period ; I should state, too. that several 

 tbousanJ duplicates are not exhibited. 



The labelling and preparations for a catalogue of this immense collection are 

 constantly progressing. The necessary investigations for these purposes have 

 been found to embrace the examination of the descriptions of all known species, 

 as far as practicable, and very frequently involve critical comparisons of both 

 descriptions and specimens, which require the most diligent and cautious re- 

 search. In fact, the proper study of the coUeciion of the Academy will be found 

 to demand little short of a general survey of the whole Ornithological kingdom, 

 as well as the entire literature of Ornithology, which it is hoped will be re- 

 garded as sufficient apology for any apparent tardiness on the part of those 

 engaged in that department.
