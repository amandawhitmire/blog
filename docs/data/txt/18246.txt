PROCEEDINGS 



OF THE 



ACADEMY OFWATUEAL SCIENCES 



OF PHILADELPHIA. 



January 1st, 1856. 



Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Letters were read 



From the American Antiquarian Society, dated Worcester, Mass., 

 28th Dec, 1855, proposing an exchange of Publications. 



From the Secretary of the Lyceum of Natural History, of Fort Des 

 Moins, Iowa, also proposing exchanges. 



On leave granted, the Committee on a paper by Mr. Thos. P.James, 

 read at last meeting, and entitled '' An enumeration of Mosses detected 

 in the Northern United States, which are not comprised in Gray's 

 Manual, a few of which are new species," reported in favor of publica- 

 tion in the No. of Proceedings for Nov. and Dec, 1855. 



January Sth. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Dr. Lewis H. Steiner, dated Baltimore, 7th 

 Jan., 1856, acknowledging the receipt of his notice of election as a 

 Correspondent. 



Mr. Aubrey H. Smith remarked, in relation to the specimen of na- 

 tive Cinnabar, presented by him this evening, that it was procured by 

 Capt. J. H. Smith, from the mouth of a drift, in the new Almaden 

 Mine, California, at an elevation of two thousand feet above the level 

 of the sea ; and is stated by him, to contain 95 per cent, of real Cinna- 

 bar, and not to be richer than a great portion of the ordinary product 

 of the mine. 



January 15th. 



Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Hallowell presented for publication in the Proceedings, a paper 

 entitled " On a new species of Ambystoma from Lake Superior." Re- 

 ferred to Dr. Leidy, Col. McCall and Dr. Le Conte. 



PROCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OP PHILADELPHIA, VOL. VIII., NO. I. 1 




2 [January, 



Dr, Leidy exhibited the heart of a dog, in which the right auricle, 

 right ventricle, and the pulmonary artery and its branches, were literally 

 stuffed with worms. Minute worms have long been known circulating 

 with the blood, and termed Ilasmatozoa. About five years since, 

 Dr. L. described in vol. 5 of the Proceedings, the worm exhibited 

 this evening, as Filaria Canis cordis. The males measure five inches 

 in length, the females ten inches. 



Two hearts were brought to Dr. L. by Mr. Jos. Jones, of Georgia ; one, 

 that of a pointer, had in it five worms ) the other, that of a cur, was the 

 one exhibited. Tt is probable that both venas cavte were also filled, as 

 the portions of those vessels that remained, were blocked up. The 

 animals did not die from the presence of the entozoa, but were killed in 

 the course of some experiments. The cur was emaciated and voracious, 

 restless when awake, and disturbed in its sleep. 



January 20 ^7i. 



Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



The Report of the Corresponding Secretary, for Dec, '55 and Jan.,

This animal is smaller than any of the species of Ambystoma wiib which we. 

 are acquainted, with the exception of A. maciodactylum, being about the size o( 

 Salamandra nigra, Green. 



Color jtt black above, black below, with a tinge of brown egpecially upon the 

 throat; the sides of the body and tail are marked with numerous white spot? 

 about the size of a pin's head, and even larger, thickly agglomerated ; they are 

 also observed of greater dimensions upon the sides of the neck ; the chin and 

 throat [iresent numerous white spots, smaller than those upon the sides; thev 

 occur, also, sparsely upon the abdomen ; extremities spotted with white, both 

 above and below ; fingers and toes banded with the same ; a gular fold ; palatine 

 teeth in a transverse, undulatiug, interrupted series, as in Ambystoma fasciatum. 

 (See Dum. and Bib., pi. 101, fig. C.) passing behind the internal nares ; no longi- 

 tudinal rows of teeth ; tongue attached in front and behind, free at its lateral 

 edges ; tail compressed, longer than the body ; extremities slender, middle fingers 

 of nearly equal length; first and- fourth idem; first toe shorter than fifih: 

 second than third, fourth than fifth ; fingers and toes free, slender, depressed : 

 ten distinct costal folds. 



Dimensions. Length of head 4 lines, breadth 22 ; of body from gular fold to 

 vent, 1 inch 2 J lines, (Fr.) ; of tail 1 inch 5 lines ;' length of anterior extremities 

 6 lines, of ])Osterior 7. 



IlaJiitat. Marquette, southern border of Lake Superior, specimen in jNius. 

 of Acad, N. S., presented by Dr. John L. Le Conte, whn found it in that region, 

 witli a fine specimen of Ablabes punctatus, Dum. and Bib. >o mention is made 

 of any species of Urode es in the work on Lake Superior, by I'rofessor Agassiz, 

 with the exception of Piethodon erylhronotus. The reptiles enumerated in it 

 are Tropidonotus sirtalis and Tropidonotus erythrogaster, a species allied to 

 ri;;idus, an undetermined species of Crotalophorus, probably tergeminus; Rana . 

 nigricans, Rana halecina, Rana sylvatica, Hylodes maculatus. Bufo americanus, 

 I lethodon erylhronotus and Menobranchus marulatus.* I have since found 

 another specimen much older, and having a general brownish tint, (altered by 

 jilcohol,) but with the lateral spots quite distinct, among: the reptiles of the 

 (Jreen collection presented to the Academy by Dr. Franklin Bache, with no 

 indication of locality. 



(ieneral Remarks. The Ambystoma above described resembles none other of 

 our well known species, and will, therefore, be readily recognized. Amb. punctu-

latum, Gray, (Cat. Br. Mas. Amphib. p. 31, No. 5,) is represented as lead colored, 

 and u'kite beneath with distant scattered white dots upon the cheek and upper 

 part of sides. Its habitat is Monterey, California. It is unknown to us. Am- 

 bystonoa laterale is somewhat similar in coloring to Sal. niger, Green, but that 

 is a Plethodon, having a head and tail, and an arrangement of teeth altogether 

 diflferent; viz., two small arched rows behind the internal nares, the convexity 

 presenting forward, converging toward each other, and separated by an interval, 

 with two series of thickly set, longitudinal sphenoidal teeth, closely approximated, 

 arranged somewhat like a brush, and separated from the vomerine by an inter- 

 space without teeth. The Ambystoma nigrum of Dum. and Bib., is also a Ple- 

 thodon, and is, no doubt, identical with Plethodon fuscum as the synomymes 

 show ; (Sal. niger, Green, Desmognathus niger, Baird,) and Plethodon fusium* 

 being the same, they not having seen the animal. Salam. erythronota, 

 Green is erroneously placed by Gray, (Cat. Br. Mus. Amphib. Grad, p. 37. No. 9.) 

 among the Ambystomata. It is a Plethodon as Dumeril and Bibron have it. 

 Ambystoma quadrimaculatum and Ambystoma salmoneum, Dum & Bit. belong 

 to other genera. The first is a Plethodon, the latter has the transverse and 

 longitudinal rows of teeth in a continuous series, in this respect resembling 

 none other of our Urodeles with the exception of Sal. rubra. Green, (Bolitoglossa 

 rubra, D. & B.) Pseudotriton rubra, Tschudi. Dum. & Bib. have also put glulin- 

 osum and auriculatum in the genus Cylindrosoma. They are both Plethodonts.f 



1 he genus Salamandra does not exist, so far as is known, on the American Con- 

 tinent. On the other hand, Ambystoma is an exclusively American genus, 

 and has a wide range. Its most northern limit at present, is Lake Superior ; 

 its southern. New Mexico. It is found in Maine, Pennsjlvania and South 

 Carolina, (punctatum or venenosum Bart.) Massachusetts, Ohio, Maryland, 

 Virginia, Georgia, Mississippi, (opacum Grav. or fasciatum, Gr.) New York and 

 New Jersey, (tigrinum,) Oregon, (macrodactylum, Bd.) Michigan, Wisconsin 

 and Illinois, (luridum) ingens (Xiphonura Tsch.) New Orleans. 



It is a remarkable fact that none of the animals belonging to the sub-order 

 Batrachia gradientia of Merrem and Gray, (Batrachia urodela, Dum. and Bib.,) 

 and especially the Urodeles atretoderes or Salamandrides, have been discovered 

 in America south of Mexico, although so numerous in the northern part of that 

 great continent. Nor are any of the caducibranchiate-tailed batrachians known 

 to exist in the East Indies, Persia, China, Australia, Borneo, Sumatra, Java, 

 New Zealand, the Phillipines, New Holland, New Guinea, West or Southern 

 Africa, or, so far as is known, with the exception of Japan and Loo Cboo, in any 

 of the numerous islands of the AtlanticJ and Pacific Oceans. They are found in 

 the south of Spain and northern part of Africa, (Pleurodeles,) the islands of the 

 Mediterraneam, various parts of England, France, Germany and Italy, (Salaman- 

 dra, Triton, Geotriton, Euproctus,) the north of Africa, Syria, (Triton ?) and 

 Japan, (Cynops, Onychodactylus, Ellipsoglossa,) but appear to be more abun- 

 dant in North America, and comprise genera not yet observed in other parts of 

 the world, viz., Ambystoma, Tsch., which contains many species, Plethodon, 

 Tsch., Desmognathus, Bd., Spelerpes, Raf., Taricha, Gray, Pseudotriton, Tsch., 

 Hemidactylium, Tsch., Batrachoceps, Bonap., Ensatina, Gray, and Diemyctylus, 

 Raf 



There is not only not any true Salamandra in the United States, but no Triton,

 Holbrook. 



j-The Salamandra Jeffersoniana of Prof. Holbrook is no doubt a Plethodon, per- 

 haps identical as well as S. Jeffersoniana, Green, with Plethodon glutinosus, 

 Tschudi represents the teeth as transverse in his Xiphonura Jeffersoniana. Is X. 

 JefJersoniana, Tsch. identical with Ambystoma ingens?

properly so called, for the Triton dorsalis and symmetrlcus of authors is ana- 

 tomically quite different from the Tritons of Earope. 



The tongue in the genera Spelerpes, Pseudotriton (Mycetoglossus, Bib., Bolito- 

 glossa, D. and B.) and Batrachoceps, Bonap., is bolitoglossal or mushroom- 

 shaped, being quite free and supported upon a central pedicel; but the arrange- 

 ment of the teeth is not the same, the transverse and longitudinal rows being 

 separated by an interval in Spelerpes and Batrachoceps, but, as before stated, are 

 in a continuous series in Pseudotriton. The only European genus whjch agrees 

 with the first named genera in the form of tongue and arrangement of teeth, is 

 Geotriton, the tongue in the Tritons proper being attached both in front and 

 posteriorly, and having no transverse teeth whatever ;* but in Geotriton the toes 

 are very distinctly palmated, which is not the case in either Batrachoceps or 

 Spelerpes, so that not only the species of Urodeles, now under consideration, are 

 different, but the genera also, no two being identical in both continents ; further, 

 if we restrict the families more fully than has hitherto been done, we might say 

 that the only sub-families of this group of reptiles common to both Europe and 

 America are the Bolitoglossidae, or the mushroom-tongued Urodeles, comprising 

 in the former several genera, in the latter but one, and the Tritonidai. 



It is also worthy of remark that, although these animals are known, (instead 

 of having the power to remain unharmed amidst the flames, according to the 

 opinion of the vulgar, or of " inhabiting the rivers of hell,"f ) to be capable of en- 

 during extreme cold, (the Salamandra atra existing near the region of snow in the 

 Alps,) they have not yet been discovered very far north. None of the American 

 species have been found north of Lake Superior except Plethodon erythrynotus, 

 and that at no great distance. In Europe the most northern limit is Sweden. 

 None of these reptiles, we believe, were observed in the recent expedition of Dr. 

 Kane to the Arctic regions.^ 



In making out a synopsis of the Urodele Batrachians in the collection of the 

 Academy, I had laid aside for future examination the Triton porphyriticus, of 

 which we have but a single specimen and which is really an Ambystoma. The 

 true position of this animal appears to have been quite doubtful. Prof. Green 

 describes it as a Salamandra, Prof. Holbrook, a Triton, Mr. Gray, a Spelerpes, 

 with a note of interrogation, and Prof Baird, in his valuable synopsis of the group 

 of reptiles to which it belongs, states that its place probably is among the Am- 

 bystomata, but previously remarks that Pseudotriton salmoneus and the Sala- 

 mandra porphyritica of Green will very probably turn out to be identical. Should 

 this be the case, Pseudotriton salmoneus becomes P. porphyriticus, and the 

 species now described will require a new name. 



Ambystoma porphyriticum. 



Syn. Sal. porphyritica, Green, Macl. Lyceum, p. 3. pi. 1. Sal. porphyritica, 

 Harlan, Med. & Phys. Res. p. 98. Triton porphyriticus, Holbrook, N. Am. Herp., 

 vol. V. p. 83. 



*Dr. Holbrook is in error in stating that Triton dorsalis has transverse teeth. 



j- In allusion to the Tartarean habitat of these creatures, a writer in the London 

 Quarterly Review remarks, that Scott's conversation " was rich in ease, sense and 

 humor, while theirs (certain smart and perverse, but unwholesome disputants) 

 was like the breakfasts in military novels, which seem to consist chiefly of 

 devilled kidneys, grilled bones, and other fierce and salammdrine elements." 



The Salamanders are covered with numerous pores, which exude an acrid 

 and glu'inous fluid, so that if thrown upon live coals thej' become blackened, 

 but nf course the animal is soon destroyed. 



J The most northern limit of reptile life observed by Sir J. Richardson, (see 

 boat voyage in search of Sir John Franklin,) was the north bend of Porcupine 

 River, within the Arctic circle, where a snake was found. The tortiises disap- 

 pear beyond the 51st degree, at the south end of Lake Winnepeg, (Emys geo- 

 graphica and probably the snapper,) the frogs at 68, (Bufo americanus and Hyla 

 versicolor ) 




1856.] 9 



Char. General form more slender than that of most of the Ambystomata. Head 

 small, convex above, rounded in front ; eyes latero-superior, prominent ; tongue 

 ovoid, firmly attached in front and posteriorly, more free at the sides ; internal 

 openings of the nares moderately large ; teeth in a transverse uninterrupted row, 

 arched in front,* concave posteriorly ; no longitudinal rows of teeth ; a gular 

 fold ; no parotids ; skin perfectly smooth to the touch, presenting innumerable 

 small pores when observed with a glass ; of a uniform brownish color above, 

 lighter below ; no line of lateral pores between the axilla and groin ; fingers and 

 foes free, rather slender, depressed, fourth toe longer than the third ; tail much 

 compressed, shorter than head, neck and body. 



Habitat. Wabash. One specimen in Mus. Acad. Nat. Sc, presented by Dr. 

 McMurtrie. Prof. Green's specimens were found in French Creek, near Mead- 

 viile, Crawford County, Pennsylvania. 



Dimensw7is. Length of head 4 lines ; breadth 3^ ; length of neck and body to 

 vent 1 inch 7 lines ; (Fr.) of tail 1 inch 9 lines. 



Gen. remarks The whitish spots mentioned by Prof. Holbrook, arranged in 

 a linear longitudinal series along the flanks, and also by Dr. Green, are not 

 visible in the specimens above described, probably from long immersion in 

 alcohol. It is a larger animal than Ambystoma laterale, and differs from it much 

 in the arrangement of the transverse teeth and in the coloration. A good figure 

 and excellent description of it will be found in Prof. Holbrook's work on the North 

 American Reptiles. f The Triton porphyriticus of Dr. Dekay (Nat. Hist, of New 

 York, Reptiles, p. 85) is Plethodon gluunosus, judging from the description,! no 

 mention being made of the teeth. The arrangement of the teeth in the species 

 of Ambystoma varies considerably, and with the size of the internal nares, ap- 

 jlears to form very good .specific characters. Dr. Green's description corresponds 

 in almost every important particular with the animal above described, except 

 the head, which, instead of being " rather large," is on the contrary small. He 

 states that " the color on the back varies very much in different specimens, some 

 being dark chocolate, others of a much lighter color, and others again of a pale 

 brown ; the young is nearly white, with a middle line on the sides extending 

 from the anterior to the posterior extremities," (Mad. Lye. p. 3.) Prof. Holbrook's 

 specimen was 4 inch. 5 lines in length ; Dr. Green's between 5 and 6 inches. Prof. 

 Holbrook's drawing is much more accurate than that of Prof. Green, which, 

 although more highly finished, dees not correspond very closely with the speci- 

 men in the collection of the Academy, the head resembling more that of Pseu- 

 dotriton salmoneus, (Sal. salmonea, Storer.)| Prof. Holbrook observes that he 

 had never seen the animal alive, but the coloring was taken from the original of 

 Dr. Green. 



Some years ago I described in the Proceedings of the Academy, a new Sala- 

 mander from California, under the name lugubris. Mr. Gray, in the Catalogue 

 of the British Museum, places it along side of Taricha, with a note of interro- 

 gation. It is however very different from Taricha. 'The species was subse- 

 quently made the type of a new genus by Prof. Baird, with the name Aneides. 



*In glutinosus this is not the case; the vomerine teeth are separated by a 

 wide interval and take another course ; sphenoidal teeth in glutinosus, none in 

 Ambystoma; the fingers and toes are also different. 



t The palate, he observes, " is armed with a row of transverse teeth." 



J He says, tail cylindrical, scarcely compressed. In porphyriticus the tail is 

 much compressed ; in P. glutinosus cylindrical ; the shape of the tail and the 

 teeth distinguish it at once from glutinosus. 



The small eyes and irregular whitish spots in the description do not apply 

 to Salmoneus ; the snout is described as obtuse, which it is in porphyriticus ; in 

 the drawing it is truncate.

The following notes are somewhat more precise than those of the former de- 

 scription. 



Sub. fam. PLETHODONTID^.

 maxillary teeth greatly developed, especially those of the lower jaw, which are 

 spear-shaped, sharp-pointed, more or less convex anteriorly, concave posteriorly, 

 with a ridge in the middle, about f of a line in length ; vomerine teeth in two 

 convergent rows, behind the internal nares meeting posteriorly, their convex 

 surfaces presenting inward* ; sphenoidal teeth very numerous, sharp pointed, 

 thickly set like a brush in two rows, closely in contact in the anterior third, poste- 

 riorly a very narrow linear interspace, not enlarged behind; in the original 

 specimen, this narrow interspace is not so distinct, so that they might almost 

 with propriety be described as a single row ; extremities slender ; fingers and toes 

 slightly compressed, free ; 1st finger much shorter than 4th ; 2d shorter than 

 3d ; 1st toe much shorter than 5th ; 2d than 3d ; 3d and 4th of equal length ;

 tapering to a point, very slightly compressed at tip, about same length as head, 

 neck and body.

Description of two Ichihyodorulites. 



By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



Stenacanthus nitidus Leidy. The species of a genus supposed to be distinct 

 from those wliich have been described, is indicated by an ichthyodorulite, dis- 

 covered by Charles E. Smith, Esq., in association with the remains of Ilolopty- 

 chius, in the old Red Sandstone formation of Tioga county, Pennsylvania. The 

 specimen is partially imbedded in a mass of red sandstone ; and it has its point 

 broken off and is otherwise mutilated. The spine is straight throughout and 

 indicates no disposition to curve. In its perfect condition it appears to have 



* D. viridescens Raf. (Tr. dorsalis) and D. miniatus (Tr. symmetricus) are 

 probably the same, the orange color and roughness being appearances which 

 the female more especially presents after a long sojourn on land. At least this 

 may be inferred from what is known of the habits of the European Tritons. 

 Schlegel says that such is the case with T. punctatus. He also remarks that he 

 has specimens of marmoratus (one of the very roughest of the Tritons, it we may 

 judge from the specimen in the Bonaparte collection) perfectly smooth, and we 

 have those of dorsalis smooth and more or less rough. The Triton marmoratus, 

 according to Kaup, leaves the water in June and becomes a land animal ; the crests 

 of the male disappear, and the tail, from a swimming organ, becomes round.

been about three inches in length, by about six lines in breadth at its base ; and 

 it gradually tapers towards the apex. The anterior margin is convex. The 

 posterior border at the edge of the exposed surface of the fossil is furnished with 

 a row of closely set serrations, directed obliquely downward, of which eight may 

 be counted within the space of seven lines. Whether there is a second row of 

 serrations, the imbedded state of the very friable bone in a hard matrix will not 

 permit me to determine. 



The broad surface which is exposed in the specimen, so far as it is preserved, 

 is longitudinally furrowed ; and about three-fourths of an inch from the broken 

 summit it exhibits a transverse zigzag fissure, which may probably be the re- 

 sult of an original fracture, although it has very much the appearance of being 

 an articulation. 



Cylindracanthus ornatus Leidy. On several occasions fragments of appa- 

 rent fossil bones have been submitted to my inspection, the character of 

 which has exceedingly puzzled me, and although I now view them as portions 

 of ichtliyodorulites, I am not positive of the correctness of my conclusion. The 

 specimens alluded to are found in the cretaceous formations of New Jersey 

 and Alabama. The most perfect one was obtained by W. Taylor, Esq., from 

 near Pemberton, Burlington co.. New Jersey. It is over three inches in length 

 with the extremities broken off, is straight and gradually tapering, and is per- 

 fectly circular in transverse section. At the thicker end it is six and one quarter 

 lines in diameter, and at the other end five lines. The centre presents a double 

 tubular perforation of comparatively small calibre. The surface is invested with 

 a thick, enamel-like layer, which is dense, brittle, and shining, and deeply 

 fluted ; the intervening ridges being of nearly uniform diameter, with pairs oc- 

 casionally converging into single ones in their course. 



Sy7ioj)sis of the Mycetophagid^ of the United States. 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



The genera of this family of Coleoptera which have been thus far discovered 

 in the country, are Mycetophagus, Litargus, Typhaea, and Diphyllus. Of the latter 

 genus two species are known to me, one found by Dr. Melsheimer in Pennsylvania, 

 and the other by me at Tucson, in the valley of the Gila. I regret that the absence 

 of the specimens prevents me from making them known on the present occasion. 

 Thus if Diplocoelus be combined with Diphyllus as recommended by Lacordaire 

 (Gen. Col. 2, 447,) the only genus left unrepresented in the United States, will 

 be Triphylius. Of the described species none are unknown to me. 

 The genera may be thus separated : 



Tarsi maris antici 3-articulati ; (thorax versus latera baud carinatus) 

 Oculi transversi ; 



Antennarum clava elongata, multiarticulata I^tycetophagus.

 part of the elytra which then become marked :

 tending inwards below the scutel nearly to the suture ; two very small spots a 

 little behind the middle, and a larger rounded one very near the apex. Alabama,

Pennsylvania, Dr. Melsheimer ; Alabama, Haldeman. I have been compelled 

 to change the name proposed by Dr. Melsheimer, as by an unfortunate error his 

 description was made from two distinct species, one being M. flexuosus, while 

 the other is the present: it, however, affords me much pleasure to commemo- 

 rate his long continued and successful labors in American Entomology by attach- 

 ing his name to this species, which he was the first to detect.

 United States, Dr. Melsheimer has changed the name of this species to M. bisig- 

 natus, under the impression that the name had been previously employed. I do 

 not, however, find any other described species named bipustulatus, and have 

 therefore replaced the name first given.

One immature specimen found in Illinois, by Mr. Willcox. This species seems 

 bv the arrangement of the colors to be very distinct from any other found on 

 the Atlantic slope. It differs from the preceding by the distinct punctuation of 

 the elytra, and from the next by the same characters, and by the posterior band 

 being narrow, as well as by the anterior pale spots not occupying nearly half 

 the surface of the elytra.

Colorado river, California, near the junction of the Gila. The pale markings 

 of the elytra are so large that they may be described as pale with the apical fourth 

 and a broad band at the middle obscure ; the latter is dilated externally and 

 includes a pale spot. The hairs of the elytx-a do not appear to be arranged in 

 rows.

Note on the genus Lithodus Schonherr. 

 By JooN L. Le Conte, M. D. 



On examiaing a considerable number of specimens of this curious genus, pro- 

 cured by me several years ago, in the valley of the Platte River, it became evi- 

 dent at once that several species existed ; from the close resemblance in color, 

 form and sculpture, it seemed to be a matter of difficulty to separate them, and 

 I proposed to leave them until time and inclination would induce some entomo- 

 logist to labor upon a monograph of our native Curculionid<e ; such time being, 

 however, apparently remote, and desiring to make use of the names of these 

 objects in other investigations, I have thought it desirable to make them known. 



The species are all of a dull black color without lustre, and covered, when 

 alive, with a crust of dirty brown matter ; the surface is thinly clothed with very 

 short yellowish bristles, which proceed from punctures ; the punctures of the 

 head are small, and the front is deeply sulcate : the rostrum is shorter than the 

 head, flat, slightly narrowed in front, with the mandibles distinct. The thorax 

 is longer than wide, uneven, very coarsely punctured, rounded on the sides and 

 narrowed somewhat rapidly in front, (except in L. longior) ; the disc has four 

 %ague impressions, and sometimes a slight dorsal channel: the part near the apex 

 is transversely elevated, but more so in some species than in otjhers ; the sides 

 are transversely impressed near the apex. 



The elytra are convex, connate, declivous and somewhat pointed behind, emar- 

 ginate at base, with the humeral angles variously prolonged and embracing the 

 base of the thorax : they have rows of large irregular foveae, and the interstices 

 are alternately more elevated : between the foveae may be seen a few elevated 

 punctures. The legs are feeble, the tarsi are not dilated, and the pectoral ex- 

 cavation does not reach the anterior coxae. 



1. L. h u m eralis , thorace fortius inaequali, ad apicem fortiter ti-ansversim 

 elevato ; elytris humeris valde productis, ad thoracis tertiam partem extenden- 

 tibus, extrorsum curvatis. Long. -33.

 Brachycerus humeralis Say, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. 5, 254.

The humeral angles are much longer than in any of the others, and very dis- 

 tinctly bent outwards. 



2. L. r e c t u s , thorace fortius inaequali, ad apicem fortiter transversim elevato ; 

 elytris humeris valde productis, ad thoracis quartam partem extendentibus por- 

 rectis. Long. -35. 



One specimen. The thorax is as strongly impressed, and as much elevated at 

 the base as in the preceding, but the humeral angles are less prolonged, and not 

 curved outwards. 



3. L. af finis, thorace minus inaequali, ad apicem modice transversim ele- 

 vato, in latera minus profunde impresso ; elytris humeris breviter recte productis. 

 Long. -35. 



Differs from the next by the less strongly impressed and less deeply punctured 

 thorax. 



4. L. r u d i s , thorace valde cribroso, inaequali, ad apicem magis transversim 

 elevato, in latera fortius impresso, elytris (saepe tomento variegatis) humeris 

 breviter recte productis. Long. -31. -35. 



The thorax is more strongly and densely punctured than in the others, and the 

 small elevations between the impressed foveae of the elytra are usually more 

 distinct.

Notice of three genera of Scarab^id^ found in the United^ States. 

 By John L. Le Conte, M. D 



On account of the great resemblance in appearance betwet,s species of different 

 genera among several of the tribes of Scarabteidae, much confusion has resulted 

 from the effort to place our species properly. This has perhaps been particu- 

 larly the case with our smaller Dynastidae. Eight species were placed by me in 

 the genus Bothynus, and the species known to Burmeister were placed by that 

 author in Podalgus and Heteronychus. A more careful examination convinced 

 him that the reference to the former of these two genera was incorrect, and 

 peculiarities in the stridulating organs required the construction of a new genus, 

 Ligyrus Burm. (Lamell. 3,542.) Although Heteronychus relict us is not 

 mentioned, it also belongs to this genus, which comprises all the species from 

 the United States known Ao Burmeister, except his Podalgus obesus (Bothynus 

 castaneus Mels.) 



The genus Ligyrus possesses a small elliptical plate of stridulating surface on 

 the inner surface of the elytra, near the outer and posterior margin ; the mandi- 

 bles are strongly dentate externally, and the outer lobe of the rnaxillaB are toothed 

 at the tip. 



In the third volume of Prof. Lacordaire's admirable work on the genera of 

 Coleoptera, these genera are carefully divided into groups, with the characters sub- 

 ordinated ; and in one of the valuable notes he indicates the existence of a genus 

 not recognized by Burmeister, and distinguished by having no organs of stridu- 

 lation. No name was suggested, as the scope of Lacordaire's book permitted the 

 introduction of no new materials ; but, as I find myself under the necessity of 

 referring to the species in some catalogues now preparing for publication, I have 

 been obliged again to review those referred by me to Bothynus, and now present 

 the results, with the addition of two other remarkable genera. 



LiGYR0s Burm. 



As the inner surface of the elytra cannot always be conveniently examined, 

 the following characters may be used to recognize the species of this genus. 

 The mandibles are strongly toothed externally; the clypeus is only narrowly 

 margined, furnished usually with two small upright teeth at the apex ; the front 

 is always transversely carinated, but the carina does not reach the sides of the 

 head. The species may be divided into two groups, and the first may again be 

 subdivided according as the clypeus has one or two apical teeth.

Our most common species; found from Massachusetts to Texas, and west- 

 wardly to Santa Fe, Colorado River and Oregon. The specimens from Califor- 

 nia, Oregon and Texas differ in having the sides of the thorax more regularly 

 rounded, and in the Californian and Oregon specimens the inner striaj of the 

 elytra are frequently almost obliterated, and the thorax scarcely foveate. From 

 the locality there can be no doubt that this is De Geer's species, with the de- 

 scription of which it corresponds. The differences between this and the pre- 

 ceding have been already mentioned ; from the next it differs (apart from the 

 maxillaB) by the less deep punctures of the elytra, and by the rugosely punc- 

 tured and almost opake clypeus.

Georgia and South Carolina, common. The description of the clypeus " finely 

 wrinkled, bidentate, the frontal suture elevated, abbreviated at the sides, slightly 

 emarginate in the middle," given by Burmeister, leaves a doubt in my mind 

 whether our species are really identical. The clypeus in mine is nearly smooth, 

 and the frontal carina is in no respect different from that of the two preceding 

 species. The references to Fabricius and Olivier are acknowledged by Burmeister 

 to be doubtful, and it must be a matter of regret that the name was not allowed 

 to become obsolete.

g i b b s u a, but the apical tooth of the clypeus is central, and therefore is not 

 produced by wearing from a bidentate form ; the transverse carina is less ele- 

 vated. On the elytra the rows of punctures are somewhat more regular and 

 smaller than in the specimens from the Atlantic States. The fovea behind the 

 anterior acute tubercle of the thorax is rounded and densely rugous, while in all 

 the species of division A it is polished. The maxillae are distinctly visible in the 

 specimen, and their galea is obviously tridentate at tip. The form of the stridu- 

 lating organs and the sculpture of the propygidium is precisely as in the other 

 species.

Middle and Southern States, and Kansas as far as the Rocky Mountains ; those 

 from the latter locality are smaller than those found in Pennsylvania. Slight 

 differences are observed in form in this species ; females occur usually of a regu- 

 lar oblong form like the males, but occasionally they are quite considerably 

 ovate. 



In the other species of the genus I have been able to detect no sexual differ- 

 ences ; here, however, the inner claw of the anterior tarsi of the male is thick- 

 ened, dilated and suddenly curved.

Two specimens without any abdomen, from Georgia. Very closely resembles 

 the preceding in form and sculpture, but the size is so different that I cannot 

 consider them as the same species. The only specific differences I can find, 

 however, are the more strongly rugose head and more densely punctured elytra. 



Aphonds Lee. 



This genus contains species agreeing with Ligyrus in every respect, except 

 that the elytra on the inner surface are not furnished with stridulating plates, 

 and the mandibles are not dentate externally ; to avoid, however, the necessity 

 of raising the elytra, recourse may be had to the structure of the head, which is 

 narrowly margined, hardly transversely carinate just b-efore the eyes, but at 

 most furnished with a slight tubercle ; the tip of the clypeus is varied in form ; 

 in the first division the tip itself is elevated, and immediately behind it is a sharp 

 transverse elevated line, which is either uniform or tridentate. In the second 

 division the tip is rounded, and the elevated line is strongly bidentate. 



The species of the first division are of a very short ovate convex form ; the 

 mandibles are not prominent, the antennae are 10-jointed, the 6th and 7th joints 

 wider than the preceding ones ; the one forming the second division is, however, 

 only moderately dilated behind, the mandibles are more prominent, and the fifth 

 and sixth joints of the antennae are of the same size and closely united.

One male found in New Jersey, given me by Mr. Guex. Differs from A. triden- 

 tatus only by the pygidium being nearly smooth at the tip, with a few distinct 

 punctures, and by the punctures of the elytra being smaller and the striae less 

 numerous ; this is produced by the absence of the rows between the alternate 

 stria^ ; these intermediate rows are usually known by being slightly irregular. 

 From the next species it differs by this character, as well as by the color and 

 shape.

One specimen found by Dr. Thos. H. Webb, of the Boundary Commission, and 

 probably in the valley of the Gila. This species differs so much from the other 

 species of the genus, that it can hardly be associated with them ; I have, how- 

 ever, failed to discover any better place for it, and do not desire at present to 

 increase the number of genera. Although the propygidium is somewhat rough 

 with punctures, I do not perceive any transverse rugae, such as indicate the 

 organs of stridulation in other genera. The hind tibiae are thicker than usual, 

 and the transverse crest at the middle is prolonged externally into an acute tooth ; 

 it does not, however, agree with any of the genera of Pimelopides described by 

 Lacordaire, and seems rather to belong to the division Pentodontides.

A very remarkable genus of regularly oblong oval form, and not furnished 

 with stridulating organs. Its characters approach those of Pachylus, from which, 

 however, it is quite distinct. Professor Lacordaire, to whom I sent a specimen 

 submitted it to a careful examination, and from his letter I translate the follow- 

 ing extract, convinced that the opinion of my most learned friend, who has 

 examined aearly all the genera of this family, will be of more service to the stu- 

 dent than any thing I could say : " The Lamellicorn which you have sent is 

 very remarkable, but there can be no doubt regarding its place in the entomo- 

 logical series. It is a genuine Dynastide, as is proved by the last abdominal stig- 

 mata diverging strongly, and by the form of the mentum, the mandibles and the 

 clypeus ; but it is related to the Melolonthides by the form of the head, the eyes, 

 the antenuiie and the tarsi. Its facies is at once that of certain species of both 

 groups. In short, it is a completely new form, intermediate between the two 

 groups mentioned, and you can without fear found upon it a new genus,

 of Pachylus, which is also a very anomalous genus.

A very remarkable insect, apparently belonging to the Dynastidae, but differing 

 from all the described genera of that tribe by the 11-jointed antenna? having a 

 four-jointed club; the 7th joint might almost be considered as belonging to the 

 club, but is only half the length of the four following. The very long hairs 

 fringing the body give a strong resemblance in appearance to Syrichthus. The 

 anterior tibiae are somewhat as in Athyreus ferrugineus and other Geotrupides, 

 but the teeth are more unequal ; the anteocular lateral horns are seen also in 

 that species; the eyes are very large, and contract the mouth so much beneath 

 that the maxillae and mandibles are invisible, or have been destroyed by insects ; 

 the thick hair also prevents me from seeing the form of the mentum. The form 

 of the prosternum is the same as in Athyreus ; the anterior femora are very 

 densely clothed with hair on the anterior surface. The anterior and posterior 

 tarsi and abdomen are unfortunately destroyed ; the middle tarsi are exactly as 

 in Athyreus. Doubt must therefore be entertained whether this genus should 

 be placed with the Dynastidae or Geotrupid* ; the form of the antennae is equally 

 repugnant to each, while the irregular puncturing of the elytra finds no parallel 

 in the latter tr.be. 



I find it impossible to determine whether the projecting part of the head 

 beyond the anterior horn is a clypeus or labrum ; there is a slight appearance of 

 a suture, but I am not certain of its existence ; the part in question is longer 

 than wide, gradually narrowed in front and acutely narrowed at tip.

Prof. Haldeman, and by the latter most liberally placed in my collection. It is, 

 unfortunately, in a very bad state of preservation, but the remarkable characters 

 will enable it to be readily identified when it again occurs. Mr. Motschulsky 

 informed me, when in this country, that he had seen at the Imperial Museum of 

 St. Petersburg, specimens of the same insect, which had been collected in Cali- 

 fornia. He regarded it as allied to Ceratophyus Fischer, (a division of Geo- 

 trupes). 



Analytical table of the species of Chl^nius found in the United States.

The close relationship existing between several of our species of Chlasnius, 

 and the fact that many species have been described under more than one name, 

 induces me to believe that an analytical table by which the species, which are 

 really distinct, may be readily recognized, will be of service to the students of 

 the entomology of the United States. They may be thus arranged :

 or race with the thorax short, more rounded on the sides, and the posterior angles 

 obtuse is C. brevicolUs Lee. Ann. Lye. 4, 432. Many entomologists are disposed 

 to receive it as a difierent species, but similar variations seem to occur in C. 

 sericeus.

 Carahus sericeus Forster, Cent. Ins. 58, varies somewhat in the form of the thorax; 

 a specimen in which the sides are more rounded than usual, and the anterior 

 angles are considerably defiexed, is G. perviridis Leo. Ann. Lye. 4, 434. This 

 species is found from Maine to Oregon, and as far south as Texas.

23. 0. nemoralis 5'ff?/, Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. 2, 65. It is doubtful whether the 

 species described under this name by Kirby, (Fauna Bor. Am. 22) is really this; 

 the expression 'thorax densely punctured' seems to indicate that C. tricolor 

 is meant. 



24. C. pensyl vanicus Say, Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. 2, 66. C. jmlescens 

 Harris, New England Farmer, 1828; C. vicinus Dej. Sp. Gen. 5, 659. This species 

 varies slightly in the form of the thorax, but may be easily distinguished from 

 the allied species, by the rough and distinctly punctured interstices of the ely- 

 tra, while the stria; are only faintly punctured. C. fulgiceps Newm. and C. 

 quadricollis Kirby, are perhaps to be added to the synonyms of this, but the 

 descriptions are very unsatisfactory. Mannerheim states that this species is found 

 in California, but I have not seen any specimens from the regions west of the 

 Rocky Jlountains. 



25. C. tricolor Dej. Sp. Gen. 2. 334. Specimens of this species were found 

 by me at Tucson, in Northern Sonora, and at San Diego, California ; they differ 

 from those found on the Atlantic slope of the continent, by the thorax being 

 shorter and more rounded on the sides, 



26. C. brevilabris Lee. Ann. Lye. Soc. 4, 437. Differs from C. t r i c o 1 o r 




28 [February, 



by the thorax being broader and less narrowed anteriorly, and by the strise of 

 the elytra being very strongly punctured ; C. consimilis Lee. appears to be 

 merely a variety in which the head and thorax are slightly coppery, and the 

 latter is not narrowed toward the base.

 Long. -44 -54. 



Colorado river, near the junction of the Gila. Larger than the neighboring 

 species, and known by the more quadrate thorax, being less densely punctured. 



30. C. asperulus 3Ienetries, Bull. Soc. Imp. St. Petersb. 2, 55. Baron 

 Chaudoir informs me that C. obscurus Lee. Ann. Lye. 5, 179, belongs to this species. 

 The color varies, so that the head sometimes becomes greenish bronzed, as de- 

 scribed by Menetries. The antennas are sometimes entirely black, and some- 

 times the first joint is reddish brown. The feet vary in color from rutous to 

 black. The thorax is slightly narrowed, both at the apex and base, but cannot 

 be called cordate. The thorax is described by Menetries " cordato, profuude sed 

 vage punctato," and I should not venture to refer his to my species, were it not 

 for the direct comparison made by my learned and accurate correspondent, Barcn 

 Chaudoir. This discrepancy in the description leads me to believe that C. var.- 

 abilipes Esch. must also be referred here : it being premised that not only does 

 the color of the legs and antennas vary, but even the punctures of the thorax, 

 are sometimes very strong, (though never dense, as described by Eschscholtz), 

 and the fine punctures of the interstices of the elytra are at times less distinct. 



The description of Eschscholtz (Zool. Alas 5, 27), is as follows: 



" Niger pubescens, capite lisvi, thorace subviolaceo, punctatissimo, basi coarc- 

 tato ; angulis productis ; elytris obsolete punctulatis, striis profunde ])unctatis, 

 antennarum basi pedibusque aut rufo-testaceis aut nigris. Long. 5J lin. 



" San Francisco. Head black, almost imperceptibly rugous. Thorax wider 

 than long, somewhat rounded on the sides, narrowed near the rectangular pro- 

 minent posterior angles ; disc dark blue, thickly covered with large but not deep 

 punctures, hairy with brown pubescence, with two longitudinal impressions at 

 the base. Scutellum black, smooth, shining. Elytra clothed with brown hair, 

 opake black, very finely and not obviously punctured ; humeri not prominent ; 

 strias fine, and strongly punctured on the anterior half. Antennse and legs :of 

 one specimen black, palpi with the last joint red, cylindrical : in the other speci- 

 men, a female, the two basal joints of the antennae, the whole of the palpi, 

 and the feet are red : the third joint of the antennae is of the same length as the 

 following." 



The description of Menetries reads thus : 



" C. asperulus, obscure aeneus, rufo-pubescens ; capite laevi, viridi-cupreo, 

 thorace cordato, ])rofunde sed vage punctato ; elytris striatis, striis forte 

 punctatis, interstitiis subtilissime asperatis ; antennis pedibusque nitide nigris, 

 palpis rufis." 




1856.] 29 



31. C. obsoletus, Lee. Anu. Lye. 5, 180, is certainly closely allied to the 

 preceding, but the thorax is hardly wider than long, and is more narrowed be- 

 hind ; the feet, palpi and antennae are rufous, the latter being darker externally 

 as is usual.

 Ferte has founded a genus Eurydactylus, which differs from Chlaenius, only in 

 the dilated joints of the anterior tarsi of the male being broader. I do not find 

 in this character an exact agreement between our different species, and, although 

 I have adopted the genus in my memoir in the Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. (10, 390,) 

 I now unite in the opinion of Lacordaire, Gen. Col. (1, 224) that it is entirely un- 

 necessary. Say mentions a green variety from Missouri. 



38. C. a m p 1 u s. I have separated under this name a species having the color 

 and sculpture of C. tomentosus, but very different in the form of the thorax, 

 which instead of being gradually rounded on the sides from the base to the apex, 

 has the sides almost parallel near the base, and very much rounded before the 

 middle. It is found in Georgia, and I have examined two specimens of which 

 one is in the collection of Dr. Harris.

30 [February, 



Locality. Middle States, Southern States, Nebraska and Upper Mississippi . 



There is considerable variation in the marking ; one specimen from the 

 Southern States was observed having the disc of the elytra irregularl_y ferruginous 

 with a broad yellow margin. Another speqimen from the South has the elytra 

 ferruginous and the spaces between the suture and 1st, 2 to 3, 5 to 6 and 8 to 9th 

 strijB yellow. 



These differences are sufficient to account for the supposed species above 

 quoted. 



DoRYPHORA Fabr. 



Ungues entire, posterior femora not thickened. Maxillary palpi thickened, 

 penultimate joint conical, last joint cylindrical, truncate shorter than the preced- 

 ing ; tibiiB rounded at the extremity and excavated externally ; tarsi with second 

 joint small. Coxa; widely separated. 



The genus may be divided into three divisions : 



1. Tropical species, in which the mesosternum is produced into a horn. 



2. Those in which the mesosternum is slightly excavated, and the feet without 

 spines. Sp. 1 4. 



3. Those in which the mesosternum is slightly protuberant, and the anterior 

 femora are armed with spines, at least in the male. Sp. 5. 



1. D. j u n c t a. Oval, convex, brownish yellow, head and thorax spotted with 

 black ; elytra pale yellow, each with 9 rows of punctures and four black vitt; ; 

 scutellum black ; suture and space [.between the two outer vittaa and epipleurae 

 brownish yellow ; lateral margin blackish, beneath spotted with black : femora 

 with a small black spot. 



Length -35 -40. 



Chrysomela Jmicta Germ. Sp. Nov. 590. 

 Locality. Georgia. 



The two outer vittfeare usually connected at the base and tip, but occasional- 

 ly are completely XJonfluent. 



2. D. 10-lineata. Oval, convex, brownish yellow, head and thorax spotted 

 with black, scutellum brownish yellow, margined with black, elytra each with 

 five black lines; the interior line is confluent with the suture behind, beneath 

 spotted with black; knees and tarsi black. 



Length -35.

Length -40. 



One specimen collected by J. D. Clark, Esq., of the Mexican Boundary Com- 

 mission at San Antonio, Texas. 



Body above and below yellowish brown ; head with a few punctures, a finely 

 impressed vertical line, and a few small impressions between the eyes ; thorax 

 with a few scattered punctures, larger and more obvious at the sides, elytra 

 finely punctured ; the punctures in some places forming irregular rows.

Ohtsomela Linn. 



Palpi with the last joint not longer than the preceding ; tarsi with second joint 

 smaller than the first and third ; ungues simple ; coxec of anterior feet moderately 

 or slightly, those of the posterior widely separated. The body varies in form 

 from rounded to oval, and even to elongate ; it is usually winged, but apterous 

 in only one American species ; the paljji vary in form, having the last joint in many 

 thick and dilated, and in others slender; thorax always broader than long, some- 

 times equally convex, sometimes with the lateral margin broadly thickened. The 

 sculpture of the elytra varies ; some are very finely and confusedly punctured 

 with labyrinthine rows of larger punctures limiting spots of different colors, while 

 in others the punctures are arranged in nine regular striaj with a short one at the 

 scutellum. The mesosternum is never protuberant, the femora are never toothed. 

 The tibia; vary in form ; they are sometimes rounded at the tip and not sulcate ; 

 sometimes dilated into aia angle ; and sometimes sulcate on the outer margin. 



The species found in this country may be divided into the following groups : 



I. Palpi dilated ; 



1. Sides of the thorax notthickened. 



*_Tibise rounded at the apex, elytra irregularly punctured, or 

 with sinuous striae.

A. 



1. C. scalaris. Oval, greenish blue, elytra punctate, yellowish white 

 spotted with blue, suture with a broad metallic black stripe branched in three 

 or four places, humerus with a large lunate spot; under surface bronzed black, 

 antennas and legs ferruginous. Tab. 1, fig. 2.

C. phUadelphica'l Kirby, Faun. Bor. Am. 210. 



Locality. Middle States, Lake Superior and Nebraska. 



Oval, rather narrower than usual, greenish blue, sometimes dark bronze ; 

 thorax with scattered punctures at the sides, elytra punctate, yellowish white, 

 and very brilliant silvery when living ; suture with a broad metallic stripe general- 

 ly black, sometimes bronze and dark blue. This insect is closely allied to C. 

 philadelphica of Linn., the difference consists in the suture being marked 

 with a broad black stripe, with which the spots are connected so as to form 

 branches ; in C philadelphica the suture is black, straight and narrow, 

 separated from a narrow subsutural black vitta by a narrow yellow line. There 

 is considerable variety in the color and size of the spots of these insects. 



2. C. serpentina. Oval, greenish blue, elytra pale gold, with the suture 

 and several large sinuous dark blue spots more or less confluent ; margin black, 

 antennae black, red towards the base ; legs dark red, under surface bluish black.

Length. -42. 



Five specimens collected by J. D. Clark, Esq., at San Antonio, Texas. 



Body oval, moderately convex ; head with a triangular impression between the 

 eyes, thorax coarsely punctured at the sides, scutellum bluish green, elytra pale 

 gold, suture and confluent stripe blue, the latter not reaching the base, with 

 about ten dark blue spots, wings brilliant red ; under surface very dark blue, 

 almost black ; antennae hairy at the tip. 



I have adopted the name used in Dr. Le Conte's Cabinet. In dried specimens 

 the golden tint of the elytra fades, and the color becomes yellowish white. 



3. C. dislocata. Oval, bluish green, elytra pale ferruginous, with subsutu- 

 ral vitta and several sinuous black spots more or less confluent, antennae black- 

 ish, red at the base, legs and under surface black. Tab. 1, fig. 4.

This insect is allied to 0. p u 1 c h r a, but in that species the outer vittae arc 

 usually entirely confluent into one broad stripe. In C. casta these lines are 

 narrow and the subsutural one is confluent only behind the middle.

Related to C. e x c 1 a m t i o n i s, but is smaller, with head and thorax more 

 shining and less punctured ; with the conjoined Aattse more abbreviated behind 

 there is no lateral dot at the middle, and the epipleurae are not ferruginous, ex 

 cept at the extreme margin. 



12. C. d i s r u p t a . Round and convex, blackish ; thorax coarsely punctured, 

 elytra pale yellow, punctured ; the suture, sub-sutural vitta and three other 

 discoidal narrow ones anteriorly abbreviated, with several sub-marginal bronzed 

 dots; legs and under surface blackish. Tab. 1, fig. 10.

Locality. Louisiana and Kansas. 



This insect is of the same form as the previous ones, but may be dis- 

 tinguished by the interruption of the interior dorsal vittae ; the middle one nearly 

 unites posteriorly with the inner one, but is a little shorter than it; the outer 

 posterior dots are directly in continuation of the external abbreviated vitta : 

 epipleurae pale. 



13. C. h y b r i d a. Ferruginous, elytra pale yellow, with a wide sutui-al and

There is _great variety in the marking, a specimen from Nebraska has the 

 band divided into three, the first joined to the second at the base, the middle 

 one sinuous and joined to the outer one at the tip, the outer one very faint, at 

 the base. 



14. 0. incisa. Oval, rounded, bronzed, ferruginous; tliorax with coarse

This insect has the same form and size as 0. p u 1 c h r a, the punctures of the 

 dark vitta and those of the external rows are, however, more distinct, and the form 

 of the vittae different. The sutural one is not prolonged at the base, but trun- 

 cate anteriorly at the scutellum, which, as usual, is dark colored ; at about two- 

 thirds the length it is suddenly slightly dilated nearly to the apex. The outer 

 vitta is a very broad spot extending three-fourths the length of the elytra ; 

 nan'owed before and behind, convex on its inner, but moderately emarginate on 

 its outer surface about the middle.

Notes on North American Birds in the Collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences, 

 Philadelphia, and National Museum, Washinyton. 



By John Cassin.

 Oct. ed. i, pi. 6. 



On examination of not less than twenty specimens of this bird from various 

 localities in the Western countries of North America, I have found the charac- 

 ters constantly present which distinguish it from Buteo borealis, as pointed out 

 in my Birds of California and Texas, p. 98. The voice of this species is repre- 

 sented by several of the late naturalists who have visited California, as quite 

 peculiar, and I am assured by my friend Dr. Thos. M. Brewer, of Boston, that 

 the egg is entirely different from that of B. boreali.f. Though nearly related to 

 that species, it is very probably entitled to be regarded as distinct, for which 

 purpose Mr. Nuttall's name as above given is proper. 



This bird appears to be of common occurrence in California, being brought 

 in nearly every collection from that country, and it is also in Dr. Sucklej^'s col- 

 lection from Washington Territory. The specimen figured by Mr. Audubon as 

 above, and which was brought by Dr. Townsend from the Rocky Moi\ntains, is in 

 the collection of the Philadelphia Academy. It is the same specimen described 

 by Mr. Nuttall, and named as above.

 B. of Am. Oct. ed. vii, pi. 493. 



The bird described and figured by Mr. Audubon as above, is the Emberiza 

 pallida, Swainson, as any one ma-y readily determime by examining and compar- 

 ing the descriptions as above cited, with or without sjjecimens. 



This species is easily recognized by its wide stripe of ashy white from the 

 base of the bill over the eye, two longitudinal stripes on the head of brownish 

 black, and with an intermediate or middle stripe on the top of the head ashy 

 white. Ears and cheeks behind and below the eye pale brown, with a line of 

 black on its lower edge, and another line of black from the corner of the lower 

 mandible. Upper parts of body pale ashy brown, every feather on the back 

 and wing coverts with a black longitudinal stripe ; tail brown. Under parts 

 white, tinged with ashy and pale brown on the sides and flanks. Bill and feet 

 yellowish. Total length 5J inches, wing 2^, tail 2J inches.

" Emberiza pallida. Swains." Audubon, Orn. Biog. v, p. 6G. Aud. B. of Am.

This species has the head above and other upper parts uniform pale ashy 

 brown, every feather having a narrow brownish black line, a short and obscure 

 stripe of ashy white over the eye. No stripes on the head, as in the preceding. 

 Under parts ashy white. Bill and feet yellowish. Total length 5 inches, wing 

 2J, tail 24 inches. 



Hah. Western North America, California, New Mexico. Spec, in Mus. Acad. 

 Philada., and Nat. Mus. Washington. 



Easily distinguished from the preceding by the absence of the stripes on the 

 head, so strongly characterizing that species and smaller size. It is apparently 

 a much more abundant species, being brought in nearly all collections from 

 California and New Mexico. 



I have much pleasure in embracing the present opportunity to dedicate a bird 

 of the United States to my esteemed friend Thomas M. Brewer, M. D., of Boston, 

 one who to the highest abilities and social qualities adds an ardor in devotion 

 to Ornithological science rarely paralleled.

Ilab. Islands in the Pacific Ocean, Washington Territory, (Dr. J. G. Cooper) 

 Spec, in Nat. Mus. Washington, and Mas. Acad. Philada. 



For the first time within the limits of the United States, this extensively dif- 

 fused species has been found in Washington Territory, the extreme north west 

 portion of this Republic, by J. G. Cooper, M. D., naturalist attached to the party 

 which surveyed the most northern proposed route for a rail-road to the Pacific 

 Ocean, and commanded by Hon. I. I. Stevens. It is a small species uniformly 

 colored above, and not difficult to distinguish from any other of its genus yet 

 discovered in the United States. 



This species possesses an extensive range of locality, probably including the 

 greater part of the entire western coast of North and South America, the Sand- 

 wich and Feejee Islands, and is very nearly allied to, if not identical with the 

 Japanese species, figured as above in Fauna Japonica. It has, moreover, quite 

 a redundancy of names, a portion of which we cite above. Pallas gives this

This species is either liable to great variation in size and color of plumage, 

 or three distinct birds have been confounded under one name. My present in- 

 formation inclines me to the opinion that the latter is the truth ; after having 

 collected numerous specimens now in the Museum of the Academy, and rather 

 carefully noted the observations of northern voyagers and of naturalists attached 

 to Arctic Expeditions. 



Two distinct sizes appear to be constant in the same sexes of specimens that 

 are perfectly white, with the black tips of the primaries and the ferruginous 

 markings on the head and face in both, and these I regard at present as distinct 

 species. The larger is the bird described by Pallas and Forster and by all Ameri- 

 can authors as the Snow Goose, and is much the more frequent on the Atlantic 

 coast of North America. It is figured by the authors above cited and by others, 

 and specimens are frequently brought to the markets of the cities, though some 

 winters have passed in Philadelphia in which I have not noticed it. Specimens 

 of adults and young are in the Museum of this Academy, the young being 

 distinguished by the prevalence of a cinereous color on the upper parts of the 

 head, neck and body. Sexes alike, female slightly smaller. 



Dimensions. Male. Total length (of skin) about 31 inches, wing 18^, tail 6J, 

 bill from the tip to frontal feathers along the culmen 2^, to gape 2f, tarsus 3|^ 

 inches. 



6. Anser albatus, nobis. 



Form. Smaller than the preceding, bill shorter, bare space at the base of the 

 upper mandible not extending so far into the feathers (on the sides of the bill in 

 front.) Wing long, second quill longest, tail short but comparatively rather 

 longer than in the preceding, which is also the case with the tarsus. 



Dimensions. Male. Total length (of skin) about 25 inches, wing 15|, tail 5f , 

 bill measured along the culmen from tip to frontal feathers 2, to gape 2, tarsus 

 3 inches. Sexes alike, female slightly smaller. 



Colors. Adult. Entire plumage white, except primaries, which are pale cine- 

 reous at base and black in the terminating two-thirds of their length. Front and 

 cheeks spotted with ferrugiuous, bill and feet red. 



Uab. Western and Northern America, Oregon, rare on the Atlantic. 



A single specimen from Oregon is in the collection of the Exploring Expedi- 

 tion in the Vincennes and Peacock, and four specimens, which occurred in pairs, 

 have come under my notice in the market at Philadelphia in the course of twenty 

 years. These five specimens are all that I have seen of this species, and it is 




42 [February, 



very probably of rare occurrence on the coast of the Atlantic in this latitude, 

 much more so than the preceding. The four specimens alluded to, which are a 

 pair of adults and a pair of young, are now in the collection of the Philadelphia 

 Academy. 



The third species, confounded by authors with the preceding, is : 



t. Anser cceetjlescens (Linn.) 



Anas coerulescens, Linn. Syst. Nat. i. p. 198, (1766.) 



Edwards, Birds, iii. pi. 152. Wilson, Am. Orn. viii. pi. 69, fig. 5. Aud. B. of 

 Am. pi. 381, fig. 2, oct. ed. \i. pi. 381, fig. 2. 



This bird is figured and described by both Wilson and Audubon, as the young 

 of Anser hyperboreus, but neither of them appear to me to have done so on any 

 sufiBcient information, as may, I think, readily be inferred from their articles on 

 that species. That it is not the young of either of the preceding species is my 

 conclusion, being, as I believe, acquainted with the young of both. 



The figure given by Edwards as above, represents, apparently, the young of 

 this species, and those of Wilson and Audubon a more mature stage of plumage, 

 if not adult. This bird was known to the earlier naturalists, having been named 

 by Linnaeus as above, in 1766, and before him by Brisson in 1760. Both, how- 

 ever, probably described on the faith of Edwards' figure, which was published 

 in 1748. Pennant apparently does not, but gives a sufficient description of this 

 species under the name of "Blue winged Goose" in Arctic Zoology, ii, p. 269, 

 (1792.) 



If this bird is the 3"0ung of Anser hyporborens, which I deem very improbable, 

 its specific name as above is the proper designation of the species, having 

 priority over Pallas' Anser hyperboreus, or Forster's Anas nivalis (Phil. Trans. 

 London, Ixii. p. 413, 1772,) which are synonymes. It is of rare occurrence on 

 the coast of the Atlantic, in the latitude of New Jersey, though stated to be 

 abundant in the Arctic regions. Specimens in the Museum of the Philadelphia 

 Academy.

Four speciraeas were found in a large cream-colored liver, which had beeu 

 left upon a stall in our fish market. I could not ascertain the species of fish 

 from which it had been obtained, but I suspect it to be the halibut, Ilippoglossas 

 vulgaris. Each worm was closely coiled up at the bottom of a long clavate sac, 

 which was composed of three distinct membranes. The first membrane adhered 

 to the structure of the liver in which it was imbedded, beneath the peritoneum. 

 The second membrane was transparent, crisp, and shining. The third one was 

 milk-white, soft, and contractile ; and it presented a delicate, tortuous, white 

 opaque line extending the length on each side. After opening the third mem- 

 brane, beneath water, the worm gradually crept out of its own accord.

Mr. Joseph Jones recently presented to me two specimens of the heart of the 

 dog, in the right ventricle of one of which there were five of the Filarice ]\xsi de- 

 scribed. In the other specimen, the right auricle and ventricle, and the pulmo- 

 nary artery in its ramifications through the lungs are literally stuffed with 

 Filarial. A portion of the blood of this dog, given to me by Mr. Jones, contains 

 a great number of the young of the Filaria. 



In relation to the symptoms which accompanied the presence of these worms 

 in the heart while the dogs were living, Mr. Jones has furnished the following 

 notes : The heart containing the five worms, was taken from a male pointer dog, 

 whose appetite was voracious and insatiable, and notwithstanding he was 

 abundantly supplied with food, he remained in a very lean condition. The heart 

 and lungs containing great numbers of worms was from a cur dog, who was 

 always so thin as to resemble a skeleton ; and it was impossible to benefit his 

 condition with the most liberal supply of food. Both dogs were of an exceeding- 

 ly restless disposition. They did not die in consequence of the presence of the 

 Filarice, but were killed in the course of some physiological experiments.

cream color, to a dusky ochreous yellow, yellowish brown, reddish brown, 

 light chocolate to dark chocolate brown, or to ebony black ; lustrous, often 

 iridescent in sunlight. Head surrounded by a dark brown or black ring, ob- 

 liquely truncated and terminated by a convex, translucent, whitish vesicular mem- 

 brane, at the lower part of which is a minute round mouth. Integument areo- 

 lated ; areolas irregularly pentahedral. 



Female. Lighter in color than the male, and usually much longer and thicker. 

 Caudal extremity trifurcate ; caudal lobes elongated, elliptical ; one narrower 

 than the other two. Generative aperture round, enclosed by the caudal lobes. 



Male. Usually dark-brown, often inclining to black. Caudal extremity curved. 

 Tail bifurcate ; caudal lobes curved conoidal, obtuse, divergent. Generative 

 aperture ventral, just above the caudal lobes. 



Twenty females and twelve males were found in Rancocas creek, a branch of 

 the Delaware, New Jersey, in the month of August. Length of the former 5 to 

 12 inches; breadth -^ to 2-5ths of aline. Length of the latter from 4 to 6J 

 inches; breadth l-5th to J of a line. Three females from 7 to 12 inches in 

 length, and from \ to 2-5ths of a line in breadth ; and one male 6i inches in 

 length and } of a line in breadth, Avere obtained from the Delaware river. Six 

 females and two males were obtained from the Schuylkill river. Mr. Pearsall 

 has given me eight specimens from Philadelphia Co. Prof. Agassiz has given 

 me a female 12 inches in length, from Niagara ; a male 6 inches in length and a 

 female 8 inches in length from the vicinity of Cambridge ; two females 6 inches 

 in length from Edgartown ; aud a male 3 inches in length, and 2 females 4 inches 

 and 9 inches in length from Trenton. Dr. King, of Greensburg, Penn., has 

 given me a male 5 inches in length, from his vicinity. Mr. Hazzard, of Point 

 Judith, R. I., has given me a female 10 inches in length by 2-5ths of a line in 

 breadth, from his vicinity. Prof. Kirtland has given me a male 5 inches in length, 

 said to have been passed per annum by a girl, near Cleveland, Ohio. Prof. 

 Baird has given me three males from the Susquehanna river, near Carlisle, Pa., 

 and a male and female from Lake Champlain, N. Y. 



The Gordius varius is the most common species of the genus in the United 

 States ; and it is familiar to most persons under the name of hair-worm, and is 

 erroneously supposed to originate from the maceration of horse hairs in water. 

 The species is remarkably prolific. A single female, 9 inches in length, by 

 2-5ths of a line in breadth, which I had preserved in a large vessel of water, 

 extruded from between its caudal lobes, a cord of ova, broken into segments, 

 the aggregate length of which was 91 inches, and breadth l-20th of a line. I 

 counted in each transverse disk of the cord, about 70 eggs, and in the length of 

 l-40th of an inch, 26 eggs, so that by simple calculation: 70X26X40X91= 

 the whole number of eggs deposited is 6,624,800.

 extremities, brown, rigid, with the head edged with dark brown, and the tail 

 slightly expanded, conical and obtuse, 6J inches long, and \ a line wide, was 

 obtained by Dr. Chas. H. Budd, from a boy, who informed him it had crept out 

 of the abdomen of the specimen of grasshopper which accompanied the worm. A

 white when the worm is parasitic, or is buried in the earth ; cream or yellow- 

 ish white, or light ochreous yellow, or light reddish brown when it lives in 

 water. In alcohol becomes translucent yellow, bright yellow, approaching to 

 orange, or brown. 



Eleven individuals (^Mermis elongata Pr. A. N. S., v, 263,) of a dusky yellowish 

 white, and from 6 to 18 inches long, by ^ to J of a line broad, were obtained by 

 Dr. Chas. H. Budd, in the early spring season, in a ditch emptying into the 

 Rancocas creek. New Jersey. Six specimens, opaque white in color, from 8 to 

 15 inches in length, were obtained by Samuel Powell, Esq., in digging in the 

 earth mould of his garden at Newport, R. I. One specimen, of a cream color, 

 22 inches long and |^ of a line broad, was obtained by Dr. William Gibson, from 

 a rivulet in Philadelphia county. I found four specimens of a brownish white, 

 from 9 to 16 inches long and from ^ to ^ of a line broad, in pools of fresh water, 

 among the rocks of the sea shore of Point Judith, R. I. One specimen {Mermis 

 crassicaudata Pr. A. N. S., v, 263,) opaque white, and 8 inches long, I found in a 

 ditch below Philadelphia. A specimen (Mermis ferruginea Pr. A. N. S., v, 275,) 

 from Brazil, contained in the collection of the Academy, is brown in color, and 

 measures 14^ inches long. A cream colored individual, 4 inches long and l-5thof 

 a line broad, was obtained from an apple by Major Le Conte, who, with great pro- 

 bability, supposed it had issued from the larva of a lepidopterous insect, in the 

 core of the fruit. Professor Agassiz sent me a specimen translucent yellowish 

 white in color, and 9 J inches long, and l-5th of a line wide, obtained from the 

 abdomen of Orchelium gracile Harris. Lastly, I have obtained specimens very 

 frequently from Locusta Carolina, of the meadows below Philadelphia, and oc- 

 casionally from the earth and ditches in the same locality. From one to six of 

 the worms occupy the body of a single insect, closely coiled among the viscera, 

 from the^iead to the end of the abdomen. The worms are opaque white, and 

 measure from 3 to 15 inches in length, and from \ to ^ of a line in breadth. 

 When the grasshoppers infested with these parasites are bruised, the worms 

 creep out and penetrate into the earth, as I have satisfied myself by careful ob- 

 servation. In alcohol the Mermis of the grasshopper assumes in time a bright 

 yellow hue.

I found one specimen, of a pale pinkish white, 3 inches in length, and \ of a 

 line in breadth, which crept from the abdomen of a species of Lycosa with four 

 stripes on the cephalothorax and three on the abdomen, from New Jersey. The 

 specimen described by Mr. Haldeman, was pale reddish, and over five inches in 

 length, by 2-5ths of a line in breadth, and was obtained from Lycosa scutulata? 

 Heatz, in Pennsylvania.

Notices of some-remains of extinct Mammalia, recently discovered by Dr. F. V. Hay den 



in the bad lands of Nebraska. ) 



By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



1. HiPPARION OCCIDENTALE, Lcidj. 



This second American species oi Hipparion is established on specimens of five 

 superior and one inferior molar teeth, discovered by Dr. Hayden, on the White 

 River of Nebraska. The internal isolated enamel column of the upper molars, 

 on the worn crown, is elliptical and more than twice the length of the breadth. 

 The central columns of the same teeth are comparatively moderately folded. 

 Antero-posterior diameter of the first upper molar 15 lines, transverse diameter 

 lOJ lines ; antero-posterior diameter of the largest of the back upper molars 13 

 lines; transverse diameter 12 lines; smallest of the back upper molars 11 lines 

 square. Antero-posterior diameter of the back inferior molar 12 lines, trans- 

 verse diameter Vi lines. 



2. Hyopotamus americanus, Leidy. 



This species is founded upon a number of specimens of molar teeth, which 

 were discovered by Dr. Hayden, in company with remains of Titanoiherium, in 

 Nebraska Territory. The teeth indicate a species of the same size as Hyopotamus 

 bovinus, Owen. Among the specimens are the posterior two upper molars of both 

 sides of the jaw from the same individual ; and they present almost a repetition 

 of form of the homologous pair of H. vectianus, Owen. The collection also con- 

 tains two premolars in conjunction, apparently from the same individual as the 

 true molar just mentioned. They correspond to the second and third premolars 

 of Anthracotherium : the crown of the second premolar consisting of a single 

 large trihedral lobe, with a tubercle at its postero-internal basal angle ; and the 

 crown of the third premolar being formed of a transverse pair of lobes, of which 

 the outer one is trihedral and the inner one is smaller and conical. These pre- 

 molars undoubtedly belong to the permanent dentition, and if they are not the 

 second and third of the series, they are certainly the latter and the fourth. In 

 either case, they confirm an opinion formerly expressed (Anc. Fauna of Nebraska, 

 p. 45,) that the teeth represented by Prof. Owen, as the third and fourth per- 

 manent premolars of Hyopotamus vectianus, (Lond. Quart. Journ. of the Geol. 

 Soc, pi. vii, vol. iv,) really belong to the deciduous dentition ; and, therefore, 

 although Hyopotamus may not be identical with Anthracotherimn, it is much more 

 nearly allied to it than was suspected by its distinguished author. 



The. measurements of some of the molar teeth of Hyopotamus americanus are 

 as follows : 



Antero-posterior diameter of the superior last true molar, externally, 13J lines. 

 Transverse do. do. do. anteriorly, 15 do. 



Antero-posterior diameter of the superior third premolar, 6 do. 



Transverse do. do. do. 8| do. 



Antero-posterior diameter of the superior second premolar, lOj do.

 A^'ancouver, Oregon, December 17, 1855. 



"Let me point out to you one thing to be noted as regards skulls from this 

 part of the country, Avhich was brought to my notice by an article in School- 

 craft's book. I forget by whom. Among ten figures given are Chinook skulls 

 vnflattened. Skulls from the region where that practice prevails, which are in 

 the natural state, are those of slaves, and though possibly born among the 

 Chinooks or other adjacent tribes, are of alien races. The characteristics must 

 not be assumed therefore from these. The practice prevails, generally, from the 

 mouth of the Columbia to the Dalles, about 180 miles, andfrom the Straits of Fuca 

 on the North to Coos bay, between the 42d and 43d parallel south. Northward 

 of the Straits it diminishes gradually to a mere slight compression, finally con- 

 fined to women and abandoned entirely north of Milbank Sound. So east of the 

 Cascade Mountains it dies out in like manner. Slaves are usually brought from 

 the south, I should rather say were, for the foreign slave trade has ceased, though 

 not the domestic (I am not talking of home politics), and the Klamath and 

 Shaste tribes of California probably furnished many for this country, while 

 captives from here were taken still north, and fro-m Puget's Sound as far as the 

 Russian possessions. The children of slaves were not allowed to flatten the 

 skull, and therefore these round heads indicate, not the liberty-loving Puritan 

 of the west, but the serf. I mention this because in minute comparisons it is

proper to take all precautions to insure genuineness. Skulls taken from large 

 cemetries, or from sepulchres of whatever form erected with care, may be deemed 

 authentic, saving always the chance of intermarriage with distinct tribes, which 

 is usual, because the bodies of slaves are left neglected in the woods. The 

 Chinooks, for instance, preferring to buy wives from the Chihalis or Cowlitz, tribes 

 of Sehlish origin. If I get time to finish ray general report this winter you will 

 find further details, supposing always you are not tired of these. I have never 

 been able to get an authenticated skull of a white half breed. These also are 

 never flattened, the pride of intercourse in the mother preserving to the child 

 the attributes of the superior race."

Descriptions of neic species of Gasteropoda from the Cretaceous formations of Xebraska 



Territory* 



By F. B. Meek and F. V. Haydex, M. D. 



The species indicated in the following paper comprise a portion of an extensive 

 collection recently brought from Nebraska hy one of the authors. f It is worthy 

 of note that some of the species contained in the collection from the most recent 

 Cretaceous beds of the upper Missouri country appear referable to genera which, 

 according to high European authority, date no farther back than the true chalk, 

 while many of them are closely analogous to Tertiary forms ; so close indeed, 

 that had they not been found associated in the same beds with Ammonites, 

 Scaphites and other genera everywhere regarded as having become extinct 

 at the close of the Cretaceous epoch, we would have considered them Tertiary 

 species. If these beds really are equivale it to any portion of the Green sand 

 of English geologists, it is a curious 'act that we should find mingled 

 together in tlieni upper Cretaceous and Tertiary forms exactly as if they 

 and those of the older Tertiary were deposited in the regular order of sequence. 

 Such facts however are sometimes met with amongst Pahtozoic formations. 



The following section exhibits the order of superposition of the formations in 

 which our Cretaceous fossils were found, and their relations to the Tertiary and 

 older rocks.

 the apex ; volutions six to six and a half, convex, traversed by strong, simple, 

 flexuous folds nearly equalling the spaces between, and terminating above in 

 gmall nodes so as to leave a shallow spiral groove below the suture; last whorl

 with a row of more or less prominent nodes, which are sometimes prolonged 

 on the last one into indistinct folds below; surface ornamented by irregular

 creasing from the apex, flattened or slightly concave above and on the outside ; 

 last one large and ventricose, ornamented on the outside by two to three more 

 or less prominent, revolving, nodose carina?, only the upper of which is visible

the shell, contracted below into a tapering canal; surface marked with flexuoui 

 lines of growth and little flat revolving bands about four times as wide as the 

 grooves between ; suture distinct ; aperture narrow oval, angular above and 

 narrowing gradually below ; columella tortuous and having five small, oblique 

 folds near the middle of the aperture. 

 Locality and position. Same as preceding. 



Fasciolaria bcccinoides. Shell elongate-oval or subfusiform ; spire conical, 

 acute ; volutions live to five and a half, convex, last one somewhat veniricose 

 and contracted below into a short canal ; surface ornamented with fine 

 regular lines of growth and small parallel folds, which are crossed by 

 regular, round, elevated revolving bands, ecjual to or greater than the spaces be- 

 tween. Of these bands about fourteen may be counted on the second volution ; 

 suture distinctly impressed ; aperture narrow, oval, or semi-elliptical ; outer lip 

 faintly grooved, and at intervals of about once for each turn becomes thickened and 

 crenulated on the inside ; inner lip closely spread upon the tortuous columella, 

 and forming about the middle of the aperture two distinct oblique folds. 

 Length .96 inch, breadth .49 inch ; length of aperture and canal about .60 inch, 

 breadth .23 inch ; apical angle convex, divergence 54. 



This shell has much the general appearance of a Buccinum^ having the form 

 and surface markings of ii. decussatum (Lamk.) an Eocene species from the Paris 

 basin, but differs from the genus Buccimim in having two distinct f dds on the 

 columella, being in this respect more like Fasciolaria. The folds on the columella 

 arc not stronger, however, than we see in B. fusiformis of Deshays, another 

 Tertiary species. We had once concluded to refer it with doubt to the genus 

 Bticcinum, but refer it to the genus Fasciolaria, at the suggestion of Dr. Gould, to 

 whom we sent specimens. This genus, according to D'Orbigny, made its first 

 appearance in the old world during the deposition of the true chalk. 



Locality and position. Moreau and Fox Hills. No. 5 of the series. 



BncciNUM ? Nebrascensis. Shell oval, thin ; spire very short ; volutions three 

 to three and a half, convex, rapidly increasing from the apex, last one very large 

 and somewhat ventricose ; surface marked with distinct lines of growth, which 

 are crossed by flattened, revolving bands, much wider on the upper part of the 

 volutions than the shallow grooves between, but about equal to them on the 

 lower part of the last turn. About seven or eight of tiaese bands may be 

 counted on the second volution ; suture narrow, channeled ; aperture large, sub- 

 elliptical, angular above, and terminating in a rounded notch in front, the form of 

 which is well defined by a sudden curve in the lines of growth on a broad spiral 

 ridge round the outer edge of the pillar lip ; outer lip very thin ; inner lip thinly 

 spread over the extremely tortuous columella. Length .77 inch, breadth .58 

 inch ; length of aperture .61 inch, breadth .36 inch ; apical angle convex, di- 

 vergence 105. 



Being in doubt in regard to the generic re'ations of this shell, we sent speci- 

 mens of it, and a few others, to the distinguished conchologist. Dr. Augustus A. 

 Gould, of Boston, from whom we leceived in legard to it, the following remarks: 

 " Its general form reminds one of Naiica, and its revolving striae of the subgenus 

 Naticina. If we look at the base, however, we find a revolving ridge which is 

 never found in the Naticidae, but is peculiar to the Buccinid." Dr. G. further 

 remarks that with the exception of the revolving strije it agrees very nearly with 

 the genus Pseudoliea ot Swainson, which is not known to date back further than 

 the Eocene. In many respects it resembles the Eocene Buccimim. ohtiisum of 

 Deshays, from the Paris basin, which forms the type of an Eocene genus estab- 

 lished by D'Orbigny under the name of Sulco huccinum. Our shell has the form, 

 revolving strife, &c., of some species of D'Orbigny's genus, but wants the strong 

 revolving sulcus, which is one of its princip.il characters. For the pres'-nt we 

 refer it to the genus Buccinum, though we suspect it may form the type of a new 

 ge nns.

Capulcs feagilis. Shell broadly conical, very thin ; apex elevated, central ; 

 slopes slightly convex, divergence 80 ; surface marked with fine, closely arranged, 

 concentric stria3 ; aperture circular. Diameter of base 1.21i inch; height of 

 apex about .74 inch. 



It is with some doubt we refer this species to the above geaus, as our specimen 

 only consists of an internal cast with a few fragments of shell adhering ; no 

 muscular impressions are visible upon it, but the nipjile at the summit appears 

 to have occupied the interior of an attenuated and laterally curved apex. 



Locality and position. Fox Hills. No. 5 of the series. 



Genus IIELCION (Montfort). 



We have not yet had an opportunity of seeing the interior of any of the fol- 

 lowing patelliform shells, but, judging from external characters, they appear 

 referable to the above genus as defined by D'Orbigny. They are all strictly 

 symmetrical, with, as far as can be ascertained, thin, smooth, and nearly, if not 

 quite entire borders. 



Helcion sexsulcatus. Shell patelliform, longer than wide ; apex between 

 the centre and anterior margin depressed ; lateral slopes nearly straight, di- 

 vergence 100; anterior slope slightly concave, and having two broad shallow 

 grooves radiating from the apex to the antero-lateral edges ; posterior slope 

 convex, and having four broad shallow grooves radiating from the apex to the 

 posterior and lateral edges ; base or aperture oval ; surface unknown. Length 

 unknown, breadth about 1.29 inch, height .48 inch. 



Locality and position. Yellow Stone, one hundred and fifty miles from mouth.

Helcion patelliformis. Shell patelliform, thin, a little longer than wide ; 

 apex somewhat elevated, nearer the centre than the anterior margin ; lateral 

 slopes nearl)^ straight, divergence about 90 ; anterior slope straight or slightly 

 concave, posterior convex, divergence of the two about 103 ; surface marked 

 with fine concentric lines of growth, which are crossed hj very faint indications 

 of. fine radiating striae, and on the anterior side by three or four scarcely per- 

 ceptible, radiating carinte (the latter not always present) ; aperture broad, oval. 

 Length 1 inch, breadth .84 inch, height .44 inch.

Helcion carinatus. Shell very obliquely conical or bonnet-shaped, thin ; 

 apex elevated near the anterior margin, and directed forAvard ; anterior and 

 antero-lateral slopes profoundly concave ; posterior slope convex above and 

 flattened or concave below. A single strong, rounded carina passes from the 

 apex down the posterior slope, becoming gradually obsolete near the margin, 

 while two or three much fainter ones radiate from the apex down the postero-

lateral slopes on each side of it. Six small indistinct strife radiate from the 

 apex, two of which are directed forwards and ontwards, and four backwards and 

 outwards; faint, irregular, concentric undulations dimly indicate the progressive 

 stages of growth ; surface otherwise smooth ; aperture circular. Diameter of 

 aperture 1.93 inches, heigh th of apex .80 inch. 

 Locality and position. Same as preceding. 



Dentalium fragilis. Shell very thin, slender, gently curved from npex to 

 base ; surface ornamented by rounded, thread-like, longitudinal lines, Avhich are 

 crossed somewhat obliquely upwards from the inner to the outer side of the curve 

 by ver}' fine regular lines of growth. The longitudinal lines terminate abruptly 

 a little below the apex, (where they number about fourteen) and increase in 

 number by implantation, and diminish in size and regularity towards the larger 

 end, so as to become nearly obsolete on the lower half of the shell ; aperture 

 circular. Diameter at the apex .05 inch, do. of a fragment .85 inch, below apex 

 .13 inch, do. of largest fragment .19 inch; thickness of shell .02 inch; apical 

 angle 3. 



The above species is closely allied to D. gracilis, Hall and Jleek, (vol. 5, new 

 series. Trans. Acad. Arts and Sciences, Boston) but differs in having much less 

 prominent longitudinal striie, and not more than half as thick a shell ; while 

 the aperture, which in the former is nearly always subcircular, in the present 

 species is exactly circular.

TuRRiTELLA CONVEXA. Shell acutelv couical ; rolutions flattened convex ; su- 

 ture linear, indistinct; surface marked with fine lines of growth; aperture 

 ovate, acutely angular above, rounded below. Length unknown; breadth 

 of largest specimen .39 inch ; apical angle very convex, divergence 20. 



This species may at once be distinguished from any other shell known to us 

 from this region, by the convexity of the lateral slopes of the spire, and the 

 absence of revolving lines. 



Locality and position. Yellow Stone river, one hundred and fifty miles from 

 mouth. No. 4 of the series. 



TuRitiTELLA MoREAUENSis. Shell terete; spire elevated; volutions (number 

 unknown) flattened, increasing very gradually from the apex, and ornamented 

 by elevated thread-like revolving bands or lines about equal the intermediate 

 spaces ; while sharply elevated, regular, and somewhat distant, lines of growth 

 traverse the whorls fn the other direction : suture linear and sharp ; aperture 

 subquadrate, forming nearly a right angle on the inner side above, and termi- 

 nating in a distinct notch on the columellar side below. Length (unknown,) 

 breadth .10 inch; length of aperture .07 inch, breadth .04 inch; apical angle 

 regular, divergence 9". 



We have only incomplete specimens of this species, consisting of from six to 

 eight volutions, of which there were probably not less than ten. On the last 

 whorl, there is a fourth smaller revolving line below the others, and still lower, 

 several very fine revolving stria;. The lines of growtli, are much more distinct 

 between, than upon the revolving lines on all parts of the shell. 



Locality and position. Moreau river. No. 5 of the series. 



Belmnitella? bulbosa. Shell elongated, cylindrical, widening at the open- 

 ing, then somewhat contracted, and again enlarging below the middle, whence 

 it gradually tapers to a point; alveolus having a small groove down the dor- 

 sum, and marks of transverse septa round the sides ; substance of the shell 

 fibrous, fibers radiating at nearly right angles from the central linear axis to 

 the exterior. Phragmacone tapering regularly at an angle of 20 from the 

 larger extremity to the apex, where it terminates in a minute but distinct bulb- 

 like expansion; section circular or broad oval, septa faintly sinuate on the 

 dorsum and separated by spaces equalling about one-sixth the diameter of the 

 shell ; about twenty-eight of the septa may be counted in the space of half 

 an inch from the apex. Length unknown ; diameter of largest fragment .33 



inch. 



We have of this species perfect specimens of the phragmacone, but having 

 onlv seen longitudinal sections, and worn fragments of the external horny shell, 

 we'know nothing of its surface markings, nor whether or not it possessed the 

 longitudinal slit'characteristic of the genus. The groove down the inner side 

 of the alveolar cavity, however, is well marked in some of the fragments. We 

 were at first inclined to refer it with doubt to Belmnitella mucronata (D'Orb.) 

 which has already received such a multiplicity of names, but a careful com- 

 parison with authentic specimens of that species from New Jersey convinces us 

 it is different, and may be at once distinguished by the small bulb at the 

 apex of the phragmacone, which always leaves its impression at the point of the 

 alveolar cavity. So far as we know, this genus is, in the old world, confined to 

 the true chalk. 



Locality and position. Moreau river. No. 5 of the series. 



Ammonites halli. Shell large, laterally compressed, rounded on the dor- 

 sum ; umbilicus rather small, deep, somewhat funnel shaped, exhibiting one- 

 third to one-fourth, of each of the inner volutions; surface ornamented by 

 numerous small, slightly elevated, costie, which cross the volutions more orless 

 obliquely. About one-fourth of those crossing the dorsum reach the umbilicus,

around Avhich on the outer wborl, they swell out into a row of prominent trans- 

 versely elongated nodes or ridges, while the intei mediate ones die out, or coalesce 

 Avith the others at various distances across from the periphery. 



Septa profoundly lobed, and exceedingly complicated. All the margins of the 

 branches of the lobes, sharply, and those of the saddles obtusely, digitate. 

 Dorsal lobe ornamented at the extremity with four principal branches, the two 

 terminal of which are larger than the others, and again divided into two branch- 

 lets. Dorsal saddle much larger than the superior lateral lobe, incqually divided 

 at the summit by the slender digitate auxiliary lobe into two branches, that on 

 the dorsal side being much larger than the other, and again once or twice dyeply 

 divided. kSuperior lateral lobe much smaller than the dorsal saddle, and having 

 four principal divisions, the two terminal of which are greatly larger than the 

 others, and each again divided into two branchlets, of which the two lateral are 

 much smaller than the others. Superior lateral saddle a little smaller than the 

 superior lateral lobe, deeply divided at the summit into two nearly equal 

 branches, each of the divisions being again divided into two or three parts. 

 Inferior lateral lobe small and slender, having four or five alternating branches. 

 The succeeding lobes are very small and simply bifid or trifid at the extremity. 



It is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, from our imi)crfect specimens, to 

 determine definitely whether this is Scaj^hile or an Ammonite, though we are in- 

 clined, in consequence of its large size, to think it must be the latter. Our de- 

 scription is made out from a young shell measuring four and a half inches across 

 the disc, while \y& have fragments of other individuals which must have been 

 at least four times as large ; hence we infer, in adult shells of large size, the 

 lobes of the septa may have been even more complicated than those of the spe- 

 cimen investigated hj us. 



From the same bed we have a large distorted specimen, apparently of the 

 same species, which is less compressed and has stronger costae. It also appears 

 to want the row of nodes round the umbilicus. As far as we have been able to 

 see its septa, they appear to be identical with those of the above species ; con- 

 sequently we are disposed, at present, to regard it as only a variety of the same. 

 It is possible, however, a careful comparison of better specimens may prove 

 them to be distinct ; if so, we would propose for it the specific name of ampins. 



This species is named after Prof James Hall, of Albany, N. Y.

Ancvloceras? Nebeascensis. Of this species we have but a fragment, .about 

 two inches in length. It makes a short spiral curve like Helioccras (D'Orb.) and 

 is ornamented with small (bifurcating?) annular costje, more distinct on the 

 ventral than dorsal side. The specimen is too imperfect to show the details of 

 the lobes, though we can see they are very complicated, and sharply digitate. 

 Section circular, diameter .90 inch. 



This and the following species would not go into the genus Ancyloceras, as 

 defined by D'Orbigny, but appear to be closely related to foriBS, so referred by 

 Pictet and others.

Ancyloceras? Cheyenensis. The only specimen of this species we have 

 seen, is a.section of the outer chamber, about two and a half inches long. It 

 makes a broad spiral curve, and is ornamented by prominent rounded annular 

 costsR, which encircle the shell very obliquely, and are smaller and more ap- 

 proximate on the inner side of the curve, than without. Costre having two 

 prominent nodes, at which point iAiQj sometimes bifurcate ; the nodes being so 

 arranged as to form two parallel rows up and down the dorso-lateral portion of 

 the shell. Section circular, diameter 2.40 inches.

notices of remains of extinct Reptiles and Fishes, discovered by Dr. F. V. Ilaydcn in the 

 Bad Lands of the Judith River, Nebraska Territory. 



By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



1. Pal.bosciscus costatus, Leidy. 



The genus and species ai-e fouuded on a single specimen of a toolh of a lacer- 

 tian, discovered by Dr. Ilayden. 



The crown of the tooth is palmate, with eight radiating costfe terminating at 

 the margin in more or less developed points. The fang is flattened cylindrical, 

 and is hollow ; and it expands into a ridge surrounding the base of the crown. 

 Breadth of the crown 4 lines, length 2i lines ; width of the fang 2 lines, thick- 

 ness 1 line. Whole length of the specimen 4 lines. 



2. Trachodox mirabilis, Leidy. 



The genus and species are founded upon specimens of teeth, generally very 

 much worn and in a fragmentary condition, of a herbivorous lacertian reptile 

 allied to the lyi/anodon, discovered by Dr. Hay den. 



One of the specimens of teeth is an unworn crown, about 14 lines long and 5 

 lines in diameter at its thickest part. It has the form of a slightly bent hexahe- 

 dral column, bevelled off convexly from the summit of the tooth internally to 

 the base externally. The outer surface is smooth, and has a prominent median 

 ridge and prominent subacute lateral borders. The inner surface of the tooth, 

 presenting the five smaller sides of the column, is quite roughened with irregu- 

 lar granulations. Tlie base of the tooth is hollow, and its walls at the broken 

 border of the specimen are IJ lines thick. 



Li another and much worn specimen of a tooth, which had apparently been 

 shed, and is now 4^ lines long ; the triturating surface is slightly concave and 

 pentahedral, with concave sideS, and is 4 lines in diameter. The two portions 

 of the outer surface incline much more from the median ridge than in the pre- 

 ceding specimen ; and the base of the tooth is hollowed, apparently from the 

 pressure of a successor. 



3. Troodon pormosds, Leidy. 



The genus and species are founded on a single specimen of a tooth of a lacer- 

 tian, discovered by Dr. Hayden. 



The specimen consists of a compressed, curved, conical crown with tren- 

 chant edges. The outer side is more convex than the inner, which is worn 

 off towards the apex from friction of the opposing tooth. The trenchant edges 

 are coarsely denticulated ; the denticulations themselves being compressed 

 conical, witli trenchant edges, and are bent in such a manner that their apices 

 are directed towards the summit of the crown. The base of the tooth is hollow, 

 and is 2 lines wide and 1 J lines transversely ; and the length of the specimen is 

 3 lines. 



4. Deinodo.v horkidus, Lcid}'. 



This genus and species are founded on a number of specimens, consisting of 

 fragments of teeth of a saurian reptile, discovered by Dr. Hayden. 



Nine of the specimens referred to consist of crowns of teeth or of their sum- 

 mits, which resemble those of Mcgalosaurus, being compressed conical and 

 curved, and having trenchant, dentatcd borders. They are generally thicker 

 in relation to their breadth than in Megalosaunis, which might only be a specific 

 distinction, were it not that there are several other teeth in the same collection 

 apparently of the same animal, but quite peculiar in form. 



One of the specimens is a curved conical crown", nearly circular in transverse 

 section, having a prominent dentated ridge on each side. A second specimen 

 is a crown, deuii-elliptical in transverse section, with the posterior borders den- 

 tated. A third specimen is a small fragment of a very large tooth, apparently 




IS.IG.] 73 



with nearly the same foi-m as the hatter ; and a fourth specimen is a portion of 

 the crown of a tooth, demi-elliptical in transverse section, with the posterior 

 borders elevated but not dentated. 



Had the different forms of teeth above indicated been obtained from different 

 localities, they might have been referred to at least four distinct genera, but 

 having been discovered together, and possessing the same structural appear- 

 ances, I suspect them to have belonged to one and the same species. 



Tlie largest specimen resembling the teeth of Mcgalomurus in its present con- 

 dition, is 1} inches long from the apex, J of an inch broad at base, and 5 lines 

 thick. One of the specimens, which is demi-elliptical in section, is over an inch 

 in length from tlie apex, 8 lines broad at base, and 3i lines wide at the posterior 

 surface. Anotlicr specimen, apparently with the same form as that just indi- 

 cated, in its perfect condition appears to have had the crown over two inches in 

 length, nearly an inch in breadth, and about half an inch in width })ostcriorly. 



5. Crocodilus humilis, Leidy. 



.The species is founded on ten specimens of shed crowns of teeth, apparently 

 of a small species of crocodile. The largest specimen is 7 J lines long and 3^ 

 lines in diameter at base, which is nearly circular. Another specimen is 1 lines 

 long and 2.y lines in diameter at base ; and a third specimen is 6 lines long and 

 Sj lines in diameter at base. These are all moderately curved conical, nearly 

 circular in transverse section, with the two usual internal acute ridges, and with 

 the intervening surfaces slightly striate or nearly smooth. The crown of a pos- 

 terior tooth is compressed, mammillarj' in form, 2\ lines long and 2\ wide at 

 base, with the summit obtuse, and the sides finely and longitudinally rugose. 



6. Trionyx foveatds, Leidy. 



The species is founded on fragments of several costal and sternal plates. The 

 exterior surface of the costal plates is covered with pits, excepting close to the 

 margins ; and the pits are small and round at the vertebral extremity, and gradu- 

 ally increase in size outwardly and become antero-posterioidy oblong oval and 

 reniform. A vertebral fragment of a third or fourth costal plate, a little over an 

 inch in length, is 11 lines wide and 2 lines thick. Small fragments of the sternal 

 plates present an exterior surface covered with broken vermicular ridges and 

 tubercles separated by wide intervals. Fragments of a hyposternal plate are 3 

 lines in thickness. 



1. Lepidotus occidentalis, Leidy. " 



A species proposed on five specimens of thick lozenge-shaped scales, with the 

 root prolonged in the direction of the long diameter. The enamelled surf ice of 

 the scales is smooth and shining. The largest one has its sides about 4 lines 

 long, the smallest one about 2^ lines long. 



8. Lepidotus Haydeni, Leidy. 



A species proposed on a single specimen of a thick oblong square scale, the 

 long sides of which measure 5 lines, and the short sides 3^ lines. The root pro- 

 jects forward from one of the long sides, and the enamelled surface of the scales 

 is covered with parallel square lines. 



This species is named in honor of Dr. Hayden, who collected the remains char- 

 acterized in this paper ; and which remains, I suspect, indicate the existence of a 

 formation like that of the Wealden of Europe. 



Notice of a new Fossil Genus belonging to the Famili/ Blastoidea, from the Devonian 



strata near Louisville, Kentucky. 



By B. F. Shumard, M. D., and L. P. Yandell, M. D. 



The remarkable Crinoid, now for the first time brought to the notice of Palae- 

 ontologists, was discovered by us as early as 1847, in a gray sub-crystalline 

 limestone on Bear Grass Creek, near Louisville, Kentucky, associated with 

 characteristic fossils of the Devonian system. At that time we had observed 

 only detached jjlates of the genus, which did not permit us to recognize its most 




74 [March, 



important peculiarities, and Tve regarded it as hAng merely a species of Pcntre- 

 miLcs (tiay.) analogous to (/'. Eta-acrinuH) Verneuili (Rcjumer.) Afterwards, 

 through the politeness of 8. A. Casseday, Esq., of Louisville, we were put in 

 possession of two individuals in a more perfect state of preservation, and these, 

 with some specimens since found by ourselves, have furnisEed the material 

 from which we are enabled to add a new and interesting genus to the farail}' 

 Blastoidea. 



Eleutherocrincs, Noi\ Gen. 



Agreeable to the plan pursued by Messrs. D'Koniiick and Le Hon, we give as 

 the formula of the genus 



Bufiul pin'ca, 3. (hie small, two irregular and very much elongated. 



Radial picccx, 1 x i>- -Four-forked, occupying nearly the whole length, one short 

 and not forked. 



Interradial pieces, 1 X 5. Small. 



Fseudoambulacral areas, 5. Four linear extending nearly the entire length of 

 the caly.K, one short, sub-triangular, situated on the summit plane. 



Column, none. 



Ovunal aj.>ertures, 8 (?) 



Generic characters. The calyx is of an elliptical form, truncated at summit and 

 sub-triangular at base. 



The base is very irregular in form, sub-triangular at its lower part, and pro- 

 longed on one of its sides to a remarkable length, It consists of three pieces, 

 one of which is small, lozenge-shaped ; the other two are precisely alike, very 

 large and prolonged nearly to the middle of the cal^x. These latter pieces are 

 joined together in the median line by a straight suture, with which their exter- 

 nal edges are sub-parallel, except the inferior fifth, which exhibits a small angu- 

 lar fold, directed obliquely forwards to articulate with the inferior edges of the 

 single basal piece. The superior edge of this fold is also emarginated to receive 

 the extremity of an elongated radial piece. 



Radial pieces. Four are non-symmetrical, occupy nearly the entire length of 

 the calyx, and are channelled almost to the base for the reception of the pseudo- 

 ambulacraj. The middle -air alternate with the single basal, the exterior ones 

 repose on the emarginated edges of the fold of the large basals. The fifth radial 

 piece scarcely exceeds one-half the length of the others, though it is much 

 wider. It rests on the upper edges of the large basals and between the superior 

 half of two of the long radials. Its upper edge reaches to the level of the sum- 

 mit plane. The surface is destitute of a pseudo-ambulacral groove. 



Interradial pieces, five, small, alternating with the radials. Three of them are 

 somewhat lozenge-shaped ; two irregular in form, articulate, with the short 

 radial piece. 



Fseudoambulacral areas, four are linear, commence at the central summit, open- 

 ing and descend nearly to the base ; the fifth is triangular and lies horizontally 

 on the summit jilane just within the edge of the short radial piece. 



Ovarial apertures. Only eight of tnese openings are visible in the specimens 

 under examination ; two are situated at the extremity of each lozenge-shaped 

 interradial, each pair being divided by a mesial se{)lum ; but at the extremity of 

 each irregular interradial there is apparently merely a simple round opening 

 without any visil)le septum. No anal opening is to be seen in our specimens. 

 Moulh nearly central. 



Column. No trace of an aperture or articular facet exists at the base to indi- 

 cate that the genus possessed a column. 



Electherochinos Cassed.\yi. Nov. sp. 

 The body of this species is of an ellipsoidal form, truncated at summit, sub- 

 triangulai below, and flattened on that portion of the circumference occupied 

 by the large basals and short radial. The surface of all the principal pieces is 

 marked with numerous delicate striaj, slightly tlexuous and running in a direc- 

 tion nearly parallel with the edges. 




185G.J - 75 



Basal pieces. The outer long ones descend lower than the middle pair and 

 tlie extremities of their pseudoambulacral lields are nearer the inferior extremi- 

 ties of the pieces. Their internal limb is narrow, lanceolate and obliquely trun- 

 cated above ; the external one is broadest, obtusch' triangular, and beni back- 

 wards at nearly right angles, to unite with the long basals and short radial, form- 

 ing with these a Hattened convex surface, whose transverse diameter equals the 

 total width of the calyx. The middle pair, or those standing over the small 

 basal, are more regular in form than the outer ones, their branches narrow and 

 equal. Thp internal edges of all the branches of the long radial pieces are limit- 

 ed by a fine carina, terminating below in a triangular projection, on which rest 

 the extremity of a pseudoambulacral field. The lateral sutures are also marked 

 by a fine carina. The short radial piece is sub-pentagonal and angulated in the 

 middle ; its length and breadth about equal. Below it rests by a double con- 

 cave edge on the extremities of the long basals ; the lateral edges are arched, the 

 outline of the superior edge somewhat V-shaped. 



Interrad'ud pieces. The three regular ones are swelled and rounded at the 

 apex, and terminate below in three salient angles ; the lateral edges are strongly 

 crenulated. The irregular pieces are situated on either side of the short radial. 

 They are scarcely more than half the width of the others, and only one of the lat- 

 eral edges is crenulated. 



Pseudoambulacral areas. The four linear areas are convex, and project above 

 the plane of the interradial plates. The pore pieces are transverse, sub-pentago- 

 nal and finely crenulated at their internal edges. Their surfaces are deeply in- 

 dented, and their number on each side of a field amounts to about thirty-five. 

 The supplementary pore pieces are sub triangular and very minute. The fifth 

 or anomalous area is small, triangular, and situated on the summit plane just 

 within and a little below the superior edge of the short radial piece. The pore 

 pieces are transverse, wide, and amount to about seven on each side of a field. 

 Their form and that of the supplementary pore pieces cannot be well made 

 out in the specimens on hand. The apertures situated at the extremities of the 

 pieces amount to about fourteen for the entire field. 



The Eleulherocrinus Cassedayi is the only known species of the genus.

iVIr. Lea presented a paper for publication in the Proceedings, entitled, 

 " Descriptions of twenty five new species of Exotic Unioues." Referred

Mr. Lea read some notes from a paper he is preparing for the Journal of the 

 Academy on thr New Red Sandstone Formation of Pennsylvania, and stated 

 that he had, during a,<\ excursion last i^ummer, found in the darli shales of that 

 Formation, near Phoenixville, on the Schuylkill, the tooth of a Sauroid Reptile, 

 which he thus characterised. 



6 




78 [April, 



Centemodon* sulcatus. Tooth smooth, rather thick, slightly curved, with 

 trenchant edges, rounded on the exterior portion, sulcate on the lower part near 

 the base, ccrered with very minute distinct stri?e from the point to the base, 

 which strice cross the sulcations in slightly oblique lines. Length sixteen- 

 twentieths of an inch, greatest breadth four twentieths of an inch ; pulp cavity 

 large. 



On comparing this tooth with C/epsi/saurus Pe/wsi/lvanicus, which he had de- 

 scribed from the same Red Sandstone Formation in Lehigh county, it will be 

 found to differ very widely. The edge is not serrate on any part like that genus, 

 nor is it so large or so attenuate. The form, too is more compressed. It differs 

 from the teeth of Bathygnathus boreaUs, Leidy, from the New Red Sandstone of 

 Nova Scotia, in size, being smaller and being more attenuate, as well as in 

 having a trenchant smooth edge and not a serrate edge. It is about the size and 

 approaches the form of Prof. Owen's figure of Labyrinthodon, plate 63, A. f. 2, of 

 Odontographia, but it is more flattened. 



Mr. Lea als: stated that in thegreenish and blackish shales of the same locality 

 he found two species of Posidonia, which genus is so characteristic of this portion 

 of the formation and existing in immense quantities. As they seem to differ 

 from that figured by Sir Charles Lyell, in his Elementaiy Geology, as coming 

 from Oolitic coal shale of Richmond, Virginia, Mr. Lea proposed the names of 

 P. ovata and P. parva, the first being about seven-twentieths of an inch in 

 transverse diameter. The latter is more rotund, and about three-twentieths of 

 an inch in transverse diameter, both being covered with numerous minute con- 

 centric costffi over the whole disc. 



Near to this locality and superimposed, Mr. Lea obtained a specimen of impure 

 dull red limestone, which contained, on a partially decomposed surface, im- 

 pressions presenting the appearance of Foot-marks, somewhat like Chelkhnus 

 Duncani, Owen, figured by Sir Wm. Jardine in his Ichnology, for which Mr. Lea 

 proposed the provisional name of Chelkhnus Wymaniamis, after Professor Wj* man, 

 of Cambridge, Mass. 



From the same formation and locality were procured the impressions of plants, 

 some of which belong to the Conifera. One of the cones was nearly six inches 

 long and full an inch wide. These were accompanied by other plants of very 

 obscure character, covering large portions of the surface of some of the layers. 



Mr. Lea also mentioned that he had observed the same Red, Black and Gray 

 Shales at Gwinnedd, on the North Pennsylvania Railroad, where he found the 

 same Posidonicp, and some of the same obscure plants, impressions of which 

 covered the surfaces of many of the rocks. A single specimen was obtained 

 of a plant with long leaves some-whatrasemhling Xoeygerathia cuneifolia, Broguiart, 

 which is from the Permian. 



In the Black Posidonia Shales was found a single Ganoid scale, which is more 

 like Pyyopteris matidibitlaris, Agas. , from the Marl Slate (Lower Permian) than 

 any other which had come under Mr. Lea's notice. There were other obscure 

 forms observed, which have not yet been satisfactorily found to be analogous to 

 any known forms, but which Mr. Lea hoped to be able to make out when he 

 should figure all the specimens and describe them more at large for the Journal 

 of the Academy.

From Klamath and Yuba Rivers. 



I received specimens of this shell from Prof. Xuttall in 1837, brought by him 

 from Columbia River. I thought then, and I still think, there were not characters 

 sufficiently distinct in them to form a new species. The observations published 

 at the time (Tran. Am. Phil. Soc. v. 6, p. 97) are still in accordance with my 

 opinions, after having had many specimens from various localities under exami- 

 nation The purple in the nacre is stronger than any I have seen from other 

 localities, but this with the other differences would not I think warrant its being 

 considered more than a mere variety of M. margaritifera.

Descriptions of twenty-eight new species of AcephaJa and one Gasteropod, from the 

 Cretaceous formations of Nebraska Territory. 



By F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, M. D. 



Pholadomya undata. Shell oval or ovate, moderately ventricose, anterior 

 end rounded, posterior extremity rounded chiefly from below, cardinal border 

 nearly straight ; base somewhat broadly curved ; beaks rather elevated, incurved, 

 placed between the centre and the anterior end ; surface (of cast) ornamented 

 by numerous, regular, distinct, concentric undulations, which are crossed by 

 much smaller radiating costse, scarcely marked in the depressions between. 

 Length about one inch. 



As we have not seen the hinge of this species, we refer it with doubt to the 

 above genus. The radiating costaj are about equal, the spaces between, and in 

 consequence of being marked only on the concentric undulations, and not in 

 the intermediate depressions, furnish a character by which even fragments of 

 the species may be at once identified. 



Locality and position. Mouth of Judith River, in a sandstone supposed to be 

 same as No. 1 of the series. 



GoNiOMYA AMERICANA. Our Specimens of this interesting shell are too imper- 

 fect to give a clear idea of its form, though the direction of the lines of growth 

 indicate an oblong or very narrow oval outline, with a narrowly rounded ante- 

 rior and subtruncate posterior. Laterally the valves must have been considerably 

 compressed. The beaks are small, not much elevated, and placed in advance 

 of the centre. On the two extremities the costse, which are quite distinct, tra- 

 verse the shell obliquely backwards from near the hinge to the base, while those 

 originating immediately in front and behind the beaks, converge and meet at 

 various distances down the sides of the shell, so as to form arched or convex 

 angles of from 20 to 30. Surface ornamented bj' fine irregular lines of growth, 

 crossed by regular, equi-distant, radiating rows of minute transparent granules, 

 placed at regular distances from each other. These granules are so small as to 

 be scarcely visible without the aid of a strong magnifier, under which they look 

 like minute drops of melted amber. 



In its surface markings this species resembles G. Dubois of Prof. Agassiz, 

 (^Eludes critiques sur les Moliusques fossiles, tab. 1.) but in our species the con- 

 verging costa; continue to meet at the same acute angles as far as they can be 

 traced towards the points of the beaks, while on the beaks of G. Dubois and 




82 [April, 



other.allied species, these angles are truacated, and the opposite costae united 

 by horizontal bars. Perfect specimens would probably shovr other differences. 

 This is, we believe, the first species of this genus found in America. According 

 to Prof. Bvonn, (Index Palaion(olofficus,) five species have been hitherto described 

 from the whole cretaceous sj^stem, two of which were from the Neocomien, two 

 from the green sand, and one from the true chalk. 



Locality and position. Moreau Trading Post, No. 5 of the series. 



SoLEN SUBPLICATUS. Shell very thin and fragile, elongated, cardinal and basal 

 margins straight and parallel ; buccal extremity obliquely truncate, anal end 

 rounded from below, both ends gaping ; beaks nearly at the anterior extremity, 

 not distinct from nor rising above the hinge line. Six to eight broadly rounded, 

 very faint plications radiate from behind the beaks obliquely backwards to the 

 posterior margin, to which they appear to have imparted a slightly waved out- 

 line ; surface marked with faint lines of growth, and minute transverse closely 

 arranged striae, which do not radiate from the beaks, but traverse the shell at 

 right angles to its longitudinal diameter. Length 1-15 inches ; breadth -26 inch ; 

 heiglit '42 inch. 



The fine transverse striae on this shell are only visible under a high magnify- 

 ing power, and appear to have been as well marked on the inside as on the ex- 

 terior, distinct impressions of them being left on internal cast. 



Locality aiid position. Moreau river, No. 5 of the series. 



Tellina gracilis. Shell elliptical, moderately compressed, extremely thin 

 and fragile ; buccal margin rounded ; posterior end contracted, subtruncate, and 

 having a broad obsolete ridge passing from the beaks obliquely backwards to 

 the postero-basal margin ; cardinal border convex before and concave behind 

 the beaks ; lower border forming a regular elliptical curve ; beaks rather de- 

 pressed, and located a little behind the centre; surface marked with fine lines 

 of growth. Length -90 inch ; breadth of left valve -IT inch ; height -60 inch. 



The above description is made out from a single left valve, so attached to the 

 matrix as to show only external characters. 



Locality and position. Mouth of the Judith, in a sandstone supposed to be the 

 same as No. 1 of the series. 



Tellina eqoilateralis. Shell elliptical, compressed, moderately thick, ex- 

 tremities rounded ; anterior end slightly broader than the posterior ; beaks small, 

 not elevated, located a little in advance of the middle ; surface marked with fine 

 'regular concentric lines. Length of right valve 1-15 inches ; breadth -12 inch ; 

 height "57 inch. 



We have of this species but one right valve, showing none of its internal 

 characters. The position of its beaks, as well as its much greater thickness, 

 preclude the idea of its being an opposite valve of the last. 



Locality and position. Same as preceding. 



Tellina ? Cheyenensis. Shell ovate, compressed, very thin ; anterior extre- 

 mity rounded ; posterior end subtruncate or rounded from above, and very 

 obtusely angular below ; base forming an elliptic curve ; beaks somewhat 

 elevated, placed a little in advance of the middle, surface ornamented with fine 

 Hues of growth and numerous small regular concentric wrinkles, becoming mere 

 lines near the beaks and on the extremities. Length -88 inch ; breadth -36 inch ; 

 height -61 inch. 



We have only seen the outside of this specimen. 



Locality and position. Forks of Cheyenne River, No. 4 of the series. 



Tellina scitdla. Shell elliptical, small, thin, much compressed, curved so 

 as to be convex on the left, and slightly concave on the right sides ; extremities 

 narrowly rounded, the anterior end being wider than the posterior; beaks small, 

 nearly central ; base forming a regular elliptic curve ; surface polished, and 

 marked with distinct lines of growth. Length -50 inch ; breadth -13 inch ; height 

 30 inch.

Tellisa subelliptica. Shell small, ovate or elliptical, thin, mnch compressed ; 

 anterior extremity rounded; posterior end somewhat rounded or subtruncate ; 

 beaks small, not much elevated, a little in advance of the centre; surface' rather 

 faintly marked with fine lines of growth. Length -50 inch; breadth -12 inch ; 

 height -32 inch. 



This species is chiefly distinguished from the last by its more broadly rounded 

 extremities, less distinct lines of growth, and greater thickness. 



Locality and position. Cherry Creek, Upper part of No. 5 of the series. 



Tellina PttOUTt. Shell ovate, much compressed, very thin and fragile ; ex- 

 tremities rounded : posterior cnu somewhat contracted, and having a broad, 

 indistinct ridge passing from the beaks obliquely backwards to the postero- 

 inferior margin, the outline of which it may have slightly modified ; cardinal 

 border convex before, and concave behind the beaks ; umbones nearly central, 

 elevated, somewhat gibbous, closely approximate ; surface ornamented with fine 

 but distinct lines of growth ; internal laminaj of the shell marked with faint, 

 very fine radiating lines ; sinus of the palleal impression oblong, obtuse or sub- 

 truncate at the extremity, about one-third the length of the shell. Length 2*42 

 inches; breadth -83 inch ; height 1-GO inches. 



We have not seen the hinge of this shell. The species is dedicated to Dr. H. 

 A. Prout, of St. Louis, Missouri, to whom we are indebted for the only speci- 

 men we have seen. 



Locality and position. Fort Benton, No. 4 of the series, 



Cytherea Deweyi. Shell subcircular or slightly oval, somewhat compressed; 

 beaks moderately elevated, a little in advance of the centre ; surface ornamented 

 by distinct irregular lines of growth ; lunule small, narrow, oval or broad lan- 

 ceolate, not very distinctly impressed ; muscular impressions shallow, anterior 

 one narrow ovate ; posterior broad ovate, acutely angular above ; palleal im- 

 pression having a rather deep triangular sinus, forming at the ajiex an angle of 

 55; border smooth. Length -96 inch ; breadth -51 inch ; height "85 inch. 



Specimens slightly more elongated, but apparently identical with this, occur 

 on the Yellow-stone River in a bed we have considered the upper part of No. 4, 

 but which may represent No. 5. This species is dedicated to Prof. Chester 

 Dewey, of Rochester University, N. Y. 



Locality and position. Moreau River, No. 5 of the series. 



Cytherea Nebrascensis. Shell subcircular, much compressed ; beaks somewhat 

 elevated, small, a little in advance of the centre ; ligamentary cavity long and 

 very narrow lanceolate ; surface marked with rather faint lines of growth. Length 

 VO inch ; breadth -28 inch ; height -GO inch. 



The much more compressed form of this shell will serve to distinguish it at 

 once from the last. 



Locality and position. Same as preceding. 



CoRBULA VE?iTRicosA. Shell Small, very thin, subglobose, nearly equivalve ; 

 anterior end broadly rounded ; posterior extremity abruptly contracted into a 

 narrow prolongation ; beaks elevated, ventricose, a little behind the centre of 

 the globose part of the shell; surface marked with distinct irregular lines of 

 growth ; cardinal tooth of right valve prominent, flattened ; posterior muscular 

 impression deep ; palleal impression having a broad triangular sinus. Length 

 55 inch ; breadth -26 inch ; height -27 inch. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



CoRBULA MoREAUENSis. Shell Small, subovate, ventricose, rounded in front, 

 suddenly contracted and somewhat attenuate behind ; beaks prominent, situated 

 behind the middle of the broadest part of the shell, rather inclined backwards ; 

 surface ornamented with strong, regular, elevated concentric lines, nearly equal- 

 ling the spaces between. Length about -27 inch ; breadth -10 inch ; height '16 

 inch. 



We have not yet seen the left valve of this shell, nor the interior of the right, 




84 [April, 



from which the above description is made out. The species may be distin- 

 guished from the hist by its much stronger and more regular concentric lines. 

 Locality and position. Same as last. 



CoRBULA? GREGARiA. Shell Very small, somewhat triangular, subglobose ; 

 right valve more ventricose than the left ; beaks nearly central, gibbous, that of 

 the I'ight valve elevated considerably above the left, incurved ; surfiice polished 

 and marked with a few faint, irregular, concentric Avrinkles, indicating stages 

 of growth ; hinge having under the beaks a single prominent tooth in each valve ; 

 anterior muscular attachment indistinct, posterior raised upon a strongly pro- 

 jecting lamina; palleal impressions scarcely sinuous. Length -13 inch ; breadth 

 10 inch; lieight -13 inch. 



It is with much doubt we refer this little shell to the genus Corbvla. In the 

 inequality of its valves, as well as in the character of its hinge, it agrees ex- 

 actly with that genus, but we have seen no species of Corhula having either of 

 the muscular attachments raised upon a projecting plate, as in this shell. In 

 this respect it is more like Cordilla of Deshays, but it appears to want the spoon 

 shaped projection of the hinge of that genus ; and it is the posterior, instead of 

 the anterior muscular attachment that here forms a projecting plate. We sus 

 pect it belongs to an undescribed genus. 



Locality and position. Yellow-stone River, one hundred and fifty miles from 

 mouth, where it is found in vast numbers compacted together in concretions, in 

 the upper part of No. 4 of the series. 



AsTARTE GREGARIA. Shell Small, subtriangular, rounded below and at the 

 extremities, nearly equilateral, valves moderately convex ; beaks much elevated, 

 rather pointed, incurved, approximate, slightly turned forward ; escutcheon 

 narrow lanceolate ; lunule somewhat broadly lanceolate or narrow ovate, 

 not very distinctly impressed ; surface ornamented by small, but distinct con- 

 centric undulations, and much finer lines of growth ; border smooth ; muscular 

 impressions shallow. Length -21 inch ; breadth -14 inch ; height -21 inch. 



Locality and position. Yellow stone River, from a bed probably near the top 

 of No. 4, if not in No. 5 of the series. Abundant. 



NocDLA sciTULA. Shell ovate, rather ventricose, rounded in front, somewhat 

 contracted and narrowly rounded behind ; umboual region gibbous ; beaks 

 prominent, incurved, approximate, located in advance of the middle ; surface 

 marked with distinctly elevated, regular concentric lines, about equal to the 

 spaces between, and stronger on the middle than towards the extremities of the 

 valves ; dorsal border marked by a distinct longitudinal groove behind the 

 beaks. Length -39 inch ; breadth -21 inch ; height -22 inch. 



From N. ventricosa of Hall and Meek, (see vol. 5, new series. Trans. Am. Acad. 

 Arts and Sciences,) to which it bears some resemblance, this may be distin- 

 guished by its beaks being located nearer the anterior end, and by its larger 

 size and comparatively smaller concentric lines. 



Locality and position. Moreau River, No. 5 of the series. 



Ndcdla Evansi. Shell elongate, narrow elliptical, thin, moderately convex ; 

 cardinal margin nearly straight, marked with a distinct longitudinal groove on 

 each valve ; extremities rounded, posterior end compressed and slightly gaping; 

 inferior border forming an elliptical curve, with sometimes a fiiint impression 

 near the middle; beaks very small, not much elevated, located in advance of 

 the centre ; surface polished and marked with faint lines of growth ; muscular 

 impressions indistinct ; teeth of the hinge numerous, closely interlocked. Length 

 72 inch ; breadth -22 inch ; height -32 inch. 



Dedicated to Dr. John Evans, U. S. Geologist of Oregon Territory. 



Locality and position. Moreau River, No. 5 of the series. 



NucuLA EQuiLATERALis. Our Specimens of this shell are only casts. The 

 species may be characterized as follows : subelliptical, rather convex ; extremi- 

 ties narrowly rounded ; beaks central, somewhat elevated ; umbonal region gib- 

 bous; muscular impressions comparatively large, distinct, but not deep; border 




1856.] 85 



smooth ; teeth of the hingje numerous, short, obtuse, closely interlocking. Length 

 64 inch ; breadth -21 inch ; height -25 inch. 



Even casts of this species maj- always be known from the last, by the central 

 position of the beaks and more narrowly rounded extremities. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Nucni-A SUBPLANA. Shell small, oral, compressed ; anterior end obliquely 

 subtruncate from the beaks a little more than half way down; posterior ond 

 round, base broadly rounded ; beaks prominent, compressed, located about half 

 way between the centre and the anterior end ; surface (of cast) having a few 

 faint indications of concentric undulations ; teeth of hinge moderately long ; 

 border smooth. Length -25 inch ; breadth -09 inch ; height -20 inch. 



Of this little Nucula we have only seen casts. It may be known from other 

 species from these formations by its short compressed form and elevated beaks. 

 It is rare. 



Locality and position. Yellow-stone River, one hundred and fifty miles above 

 mouth, in a bed supposed to be upper part of No. 4 of series. 



NuccLA CANCELLATA. Shell rather large and thick, ovate or subtriangular, 

 ventricose, pearly within ; anterior end short, obliquely truncate, posterior end 

 longer, narrowly rounded ; umbonal region gibbous ; beaks somewhat elevated, 

 slightly incurved ; escutcheon lanceolate ; lunule ovate, flattened, but scarcely 

 impressed ; surface ornamented by numerous flatlj^ rounded, simple, closely ar- 

 ranged, radiating costs, which are crossed by small, irregular, concentric 

 wrinkles, and finer indistinct lines of growth ; border neatly crenulated. Length 

 93 inch ; breadth -50 inch ; height -65 inch 



This beautiful Nucula resembles in its surface markings N. pectenata of Sow- 

 erby, (Min. Conch, vol. 2, page 209, fig. 6, V,) but differs in the form and depth 

 of its lunule, which is rather narrow ovate and ver}' shallow, while in Sowerby's 

 species it is distinctly cordate and deeply impressed. The muscular impressions, 

 though large, are much more shallow than in N. pectenata. The radiating costee of 

 our species become obsolete on the lunule and escutcheon, and are about five 

 times as broad as the grooves between, near the border. The anterior muscular 

 impression is bordered by a distinct ridge, which extends nearly up to the beaks. ' 



Locality and position. Moreau River, No. 5 of the series. 



Nucula planomarginata. Shell ovate, somewhat compressed, pearly within ; 

 anterior end very short, obliquely truncate ; posterior end long and narrowly 

 rounded, dorsal and ventral margins forming, from the beaks backwards, ellip- 

 tical curves ; beaks much elevated ; surface unknown ; muscular impressions 

 faint ; border smooth. Length -95 inch ; height GO inch ; breadth -26 inch. 



We have only seen internal casts of this species, the shell being always left 

 adhering to the matrix, from which we infer the surface was ornately marked. 

 It may be at once distinguished from the last by its more compressed form and 

 smooth border. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Pectcnculina parvula. Shell very small, obliquely oval, somewhat com- 

 pressed, inequilateral ; buccal end and base rounded ; anal extremity rounded 

 and slightly extended obliquely downwards ; cardinal border short, and having 

 a narrow, well defined, longitudinally striate area on each valve ; beaks small, 

 not much elevated, about midway between the centre and the anterior end ; 

 surface polished and marked with lines of growth, sometimes crossed by faint 

 indications of radiating costae ; hinge having in each valve three or four teeth 

 on each side of the central triangular ligamentary pit ; interior marked with 

 faint radiating grooves terminating in distinct crenulations at the border. Length 

 18 inch ; breadth -10 inch ; height IS inch. 



This little shell might, upon a hasty examination, be mistaken for Cardium 

 varum, (Evans and Shumards unpublished MS.), but it possesses all the cha- 

 racters of the above genus. The shell is often so translucent that the internal 

 radiating grooves are seen through it. 



Locality and position. Yellow-stone River, No. 5 of the series. 




86 [April, 



Arca (cucull/Ea) cordata. Shell thick and strong, subovate, somewhat 

 triangular or cordiform, very ventricose, abruptly rounded before, obliquely 

 subtruncate behind, and forming a broad curve below; uniboncs gibbous, much 

 elevated, incurved, located near the anterior end ; ligamentary area very short, 

 deeply excavated, grooved and finely striated longitudinally ; surface marked 

 with strong imbricating lines of growth and indistinct radiating costffi. Length 

 2-03 inches; breadth 1-77 inches ; height 1-9G inches. Length of ligamentary 

 area 1-25 inches ; breadth of do. -30 inches. 



This species, in its thickness and general appearance, approaches Cucullcea 

 Ifebrascensis, (Owen,) but may be distinguished by its shorter buccal extremity, 

 more elevated, approximate and incurved beaks, and especially by its much 

 shorter and narrower ligamentary area. There is in our specimen a distinct 

 sulcus starting from before the beak of each valve, and extending obliquely 

 downwards to a point a little behind the middle of the shell, where it dies out 

 before reaching the border. When viewed on either end, this shell presents a 

 beautiful cordate form. 



Locality and position. Moreau Trading Post, No. 5 of series. 



Arca (cucdll/Ea) Shumardi. Shell oval, ovate, somewhat globose, rather 

 thin, obliquely subtruncate behind, rounded before, and forming an elliptic curve 

 below ; umbones very gibbous, oblique, moderately elevated, incurved, and 

 located a little in advance of the centre ; surface ornamented by distinct lines of 

 growth, crossed by numerous, rather indistinct radiating costaj ; ligamentary 

 area straight, narrow, moderately excavated, grooved and striated longitu- 

 dinalljr ; hinge having in each valve three or four transversely striated, oblique, 

 lateral teeth on each side, and small, irregular, intermediate transverse ones in 

 the centre ; border smooth. Length (specimen about four times the medium 

 size) 1'67 inches; breadth 1-28 inches; height 1-40 inches. 



This is one of the most abundant and beautiful bivalves found in the creta- 

 ceous rocks of the upper Missouri country. It varies much in form, some of the 

 specimens being more nearly of an ovate form, in consequence of the anal region 

 being extended, and the beaks more oblique, while others are shorter and more 

 rotund. These two forms are quite well enough marked to constitute a specific 

 distinction, if they were not connected by numerous intermediate ones. As these 

 differences are not due to age or size, we are inclined to regard them as sexual. 

 In old shells the radiating costas are usually obsolete. In some specimens a 

 single raised line maj' be seen passing from behind the beak of the right valve 

 to the posterior border, following the direction of the raised edge of the poste- 

 rior muscular impression. This is rarely seen on the left valve. We dedicate 

 the species to Dr. B. F. Shumard, of St. Louis, Missouri. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Mytilus attexuatus. Shell much elongated, slightly arcuate ; extremities 

 compressed and rounded ; anterior end narrow ; beaks nearly terminal ; surface 

 (of cast) faintly marked with lines of growth. Length 1-90 inches ; breadth -50 

 inch ; height -50 inch. 



From M. Galpiniamts and M. Meckii, (Evans and Shumard,) this species may 

 be known by its much greater proportional length and less gibbous beaks. 

 Having only seen casts, we know nothing of its surface markings. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Aaicula? fibrosa. Shell ovate, subtriangular, very oblique, pointed at the 

 beaks, somewhat rounded below; beaks small, acute, placed at the anterior ex- 

 tremity, and scarcely rising above the hinge ; right and left valves alike, con- 

 vexly arched from the beaks to the base ; posterior wing somewhat flattened 

 and apparently broadly rounded ; surAxce ornamented by strong, rounded, radi- 

 ating plications, which bifurcate very irregularly, and are crossed bj' strong 

 concentric undulations, so as to give the surface, which is otherwise smooth, a 

 subnodose appearance. Some of our specimens must have been as much as two 

 inches in length when perfect. 




1856.] 



87 



It is with much doubt we place this shell in the above genus, as we have in 

 none of our specimens seen any indications of an anterior wing. It is also 

 worthy of note, that the substance of the shell is composed of an internal 

 lamellar, and an external fibrous portion, like Finna, from which, however, it 

 differs in having a posterior wing-like expansion. The radiating costae are faint 

 or wanting on the wing. 



Locality and position. Forks of Cheyenne River, No. 4 of series. 



Inoceramus ventricosus. Shell ovate, oval or oblong, extremely inflated, 

 very thin and fragile, structure entirely fibrous ; cardinal border straight ; ante- 

 rior end rounded, posterior end apparently' subtruncate, base broadly curved ; 

 umbonal region remarkably gibbous ; beaks oblique, located at the anterior 

 extremity ; surface marked with fine regular imbricating lines of growth, and 

 occasionally with a few faint irregular con' entric undulations. Length about 

 4-30 inches ; breadth (of right valve) I'TO inches ; height 2-T5 inches. Thickness 

 of thickest part of shell, near the hinge, -12 inch ; do. of thinnest part near border 

 03 of an inch. 



The most striking characteristics of this species are its remarkably ventricose 

 form, extreme thinness and entirely fibrous structure, there being no internal 

 lamellar portion, as is generally the case in this genus. In our specimens the 

 calcareous matter has been replaced by ferruginous and silicious matter, so 

 as to preserve the original structure of the shell perfectly. If the left valve is as 

 gibbous as the right, the transverse diameter of the shell must be considerably 

 greater than its height. The beak of one of our specimens appears to have been 

 truncated. We have only seen right valves. 



Locality and position. Mouth of Judith River, in sandstone, supposed to be the 

 same as No. 1 of the series. 



Pecten Nebrascensi.s. Superior valve suborbicular, moderately compressed, 

 ornamented by twelve to fifteen strongly elevated costae about equal to the 

 spaces between ; surface marked with very fine, closely arranged concentric lines, 

 crossed by equally fine crowded radiating striie ; buccal ear (imperfect in our 

 specimens) apparently triangular, rather distinctly marked with radiating costae, 

 crossed by concentric striie stronger than on the body of th valve ; aunal ear 

 smaller, triangular, concave on the margin, and marked with distinct concen- 

 tric lines. Length and breadth -49 inch. 



From F. venustus of Dr. Morton, (Synopsis, pi. 5, fig. 5,) to which this species 

 appears to be closely allied, it may be distinguished by the fine radiating striae. 

 In some of the specimens the costaj occasionally bifurcate, while the radiating 

 strife never run exactly parallel to the costae, but pass very obliquely along 

 their sides. These striae are so fine as to be invisible without the aid of a lens. 

 We have not seen the inferior valve. 



Locality and position. Yellow-stone River, one hundred and fifty miles from 

 its mouth, in a bed supposed to represent No. 5 of the series. 



Natica subcrassa. Sh^ll obliquely oval or oblong, thick ; spire rather short ; 

 volutions three to three and a half, convex ; suture distinct or somewhat grooved ; 

 surface marked with strong lines of growth, which rise, on the body whorl, into 

 distinct imbricating wrinkles ; outer lip bevelled ; inner lip rather thick, and 

 nearly covering the small umbilicus ; aperture ovate, oval, or elliptical, nearly 

 as obtusely rounded above as below. Length -95 inch ; breadth -87 inch ; apical 

 angle about 93. 



It is possible there may have been other surface markings than those men- 

 tioned above, as all our specimens are so worn that fine lines would have been 

 obliterated, had they existed. The species may be known from those found 

 in the higher members of the series in this region, by its stronger lines of growth, 

 and greater thickness. 



Locality aiid position. Mouth of Judith River, from a sandstone supposed to 

 be the same as No. 1 of the series, where it is associated with Tellina gracilis, 

 and T. equilateralis.

1. Leptochokrus spectabilis, Leidy. 



The genus and species are proposed upon a small frag:ment of the lower jaw 

 of an apparent suilHne animal, containing two molar teeth, which appear to be 

 the first and second true molars. The crowns of these teeth have the general 

 form of the correspondi^.g ones of the Peccary, and they are composed of four 

 tubercles or lobes confluent into a thick base, with a ridge anteriorly and pos- 

 teriorly, and between the outer lobes externally. Of the four lobes that postero- 

 internal is the largest, the external pair are nearly equal, and the antero-internal 

 one is smallest. The inner lobes are trilateral, and the outer ones are much like 

 the corresponding lobes of ruminants. The aims of the crescentoid summits of 

 the outer lobes join the inner lobes ; that most anteriorly joining the antero-iii- 

 ternal lobe, while the other three join the postero-internal lobe.

2. Leptaochbnia decora, Leidy. 



In Dr. Hayden's collection there are several specimens from the valley of 

 White River, Nebraska, consisting of fragments of upper and lower jaws with 

 teeth, which belonged to a ruminating animal allied to the Camel. 



One of the fragments contains the left superior true molars and the last pre- 

 molar. The true molars have their crowns more nearly square than in either 

 the Camel or Lama, and the anterior folds of their outer lobes are produced rela- 

 tively much more outwardly and forwards than in either of the latter. The 

 surfaces between the folds are concave and directed much more obliquely back- 

 ward than in the Camel. The last premolar is bilobed and holds the same relation 

 of position of its outer face to the true molars as in the Camel. 



In several fragments of lower jaws containing the last two true molars, and 

 in another with the anterior two true molars, these teeth have a strong resem- 

 blance to the corrt-sponding teeth of the Camel. 



Another fragment of a lower jiw discovered by Dr. Hayden, on Bear Creek, 

 Nebraska, appears to belong to the same animal as the former, though this may 

 not be the fact. It contains the alveoli for three incisors, a canine, and three 

 premolars. The incisive alveoli are in close relationship as in the Lama. Tne 

 canine is separated from the former by a hiatus of less than one line, and it has 

 nearly the form of the corresponding tooth in the Camel. Posterior to the 

 canine and separated from it by a hiatus of less than two lines, there is a portion 

 of the first premolar, which appears to have had nearly the same form as the 

 canine. The succeeding two premolars are separated from the first by a hiatus 

 of a little more than four lines. These are inserted by two fangs, are in close 

 contiguity, and have broad, laterally compressed, pyramidal crowns, bearing 

 considerable resemblance to the premolars of the Musks.

3. TscHYROTHERiUM ANTiQUUS, Leidy. 



This genus and species are proposed upon numerous fragments of bones, con- 

 sisliugottwo vertebral bodies, the half of h ihinl specimen, several transverse pro- 

 cessi^s, and portions of ribs, discovered ny Dr. Hayden, in an out-Iyer of a lignite 

 formation, between the Moreau and Grand rivers, Nebraska. 



The bones are as dense and heavy as those of tUaiiutin-, to which the genus ap- 

 pears to be most nearly allied. The vertebral bodies, apparently posterior dorsal, 

 are transversely oval in outline, and are perforated at the sides and lower pan 

 by large canals converging towards their centre. The anterior and posterior 

 articular surfaces are slightly depressed, as are also the sides of tht body. The 

 upper part of the latter, on each side of the position of the spinal canal, presents 

 a large, rujfged concavity, about an inch and a quarter in diameter, aj jiarently 

 for articnlating with the transverse processes. These latter are antero-posieriorly 

 flattened, cylindrical and curved. Their vertebral extremity is furni^h^d with a 

 convex rugi^ed surface, corresponding to the concavities on the vertebral bodies, 

 and above this surface is a smooth one forciing the side of the ventbral canal, 

 and overhung by an abutment fv the articular and spinous processes. 



The ribs are cylindroid and tapering towards the broken ends of the speci- 

 mens, and they are quite as uense in structure as those of Manafus.

The genus and species are founded upon a fragment of the lower jaw, con- 

 taining the middle molar, and the fangs of two others. The estimated size of 

 the skull would be about that of the Rat, (^Mus decumanus), and the animal also 

 appears to belong to the same family. The molar series of the lower jaw consists 

 of three teeth, and they have exserted crowns inserted by distinct roots.

8. Amphicyon ? GRACILIS, Leidy. 



A small species of this genus is probably indicated by a specimen in Dr. 

 Hayden's collection, consisting of a fragment of the lower jaw containing two 

 teeth, of which one corresponds in form with the antepenultimate molar of 

 Amphicyon m ijor DeBl. or of A. veUia Leidy, and the other, being the tooth in 

 advance, has nearly the same form as the corresponding tooth in the wolf. The 

 length of the crown of the antepenultimate tooth is 2| lines, its breadth 4J lines; 

 and the depth of the lower jaw is 5 lines. 



The specimen was discovered by Dr. Hayden, in association with remains of 

 AnchUherium, Ilyopotamus, Hyaenodon, etc. in Nebraska. 



Notice of the remains of a species of Seal, from the Post-pliocene deposit of the Ottawa 



River. 



By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



E. Billings, Esq., of Ottawa, West Canada, recently sent to the Academy, for 

 the inspection of its members and for description, a specimen consisting of a 

 slab or portion of a concretion of indurated clay, containing sofne imbedded 

 bones, which Mr. B. observes, in a letter accompanying the specimen, " appear 

 to him to be those of the extremities of a small animal of aquatic habit." Mr. 

 B. further states, " the specimen was discovered by Mr. Peter McArthur, in a 

 bed of bin } clay containing boulders and marine shells and fishes. The locality 

 is in the township of Gloucester, county of Carleton, Canada West, about nine 

 miles east of the city of Ottawa. From this city the river Ottawa runs easterly 

 for about sixty miles, in a channel excavated through a bed of the glacial drift, 

 composed in some places of clay, and in others of sand, gravel and boulders. 

 Where the specimen was discovered, the bank of the river is of clay about thirty 

 feet high, at the time of low water. The water washes out of the bank nume- 

 rous nodules of the clay, which are consolidated into a pretty hard kind of stone. 

 Many of these nodules, when split open, are found to coatain shells, or the skele- 

 tons of fishes, often beautifully preserved. The species of shells found up to the 

 present time are Tellina grocniandica, Mylihis edulis, Saxicava rugosa, and a small 

 rostrated one like a Lcda ; and of fishes two species, 3Iollottis viUosus and Cyclop- 

 teris lumpiis. They also contain leaves of trees, broken twigs and grass, showing 

 that there was land at no great distance. There is a ridge of low metamorphic 

 hills on the north shore of the river, extending for a great distance parallel with 

 and near the stream. On the soath side the country is level, and underlaid with 

 lower Silurian rocks, Utica slate, Trenton, Black River, Bird's-eye and Chazy 

 limestones, with here and there a strip of the lower rocks brought up to the 




1856.] 91 



surface by undulation?. I think there was an ancient Tallev excavated in these 

 rocks before the period of the drift, that it was filled up during that period, and 

 that the river is now cleaning it out again." 



The bones referred to prove, on examination, to be those of the greater por- 

 tion of the hinder extremities of a young seal, but whether of a species distinct 

 from those now found living in the neighboring seas, is a question only to be 

 determined by careful comparison with the corresponding parts of the recent 

 animals. The soft distal extremities of the tibia and fibula are crushed together. 

 The bones of the ankle and foot are well preserved, but the epiphyses of the 

 latter are separated and only partially developed. The matrix in the vicinity of 

 the bones, is marked by the impressions of the hairs and skin which enveloped 

 them. 



Mr. Logan, in a report on the " Geological Survey of Canada," (1850, '51, p. 8,) 

 refers the deposit, in which the above described specimen was found, and simi- 

 lar deposits of the St. Lawrence and its tributaries, to the post-tertiary period ; 

 and he further observes, that in these deposits, ' the remains of whales, seals, 

 and two species of fishes, and many ma:ine shells of those species still inhabit- 

 ing the Gulf of St. Lawrence, are found ;" from which remarks, together with 

 those of Mr. Billings, and the appearance of the fossil itself, we are inclined to 

 suspect the seal of the Ottawa has its descendants yet sporting on the sea border 

 of the Canadas. 



Independent of all other considerations, the specimen is interesting, as ex- 

 hibiting the same process at the present geological period, which for so many 

 S'lccessive ages has preserved the remains of vegetables and animals, which are 

 now examined by the palaeontologist as so many iconographic illustrations of 

 life in the history of cur planet.

 tion of the bones of the hinder extremities of a young seal, partially imb.dded

 Ottawa River, Canada.

Description of a nere Snake from Illinoig. 

 By Robert Kennicott. 

 Regina Kirtlandii. 



The body of this species is somewhat trigonal in cross sections, (flattened on 

 the abdomen.) and tapers gently from the middle to either extremity. .There is 

 no distinction of neck, and the very small head calls to mind that of the Colultr 

 amoenus of Say. It is, however, much larger, and the scales are very strongly 

 coirinated. The carinie are found on all the longitudinal rows of scales, of which 

 there are nineteen exclusive of the belly scales ; the external row is almost as 

 sharply keeled as those on the back, even to the tip of the tail. The dorsal 

 scales are narrow and elongated, the sides nearly parallel except near the ends. 



As already stated, the head is very small. The vertical plate is sub-hexago- 

 nal, the two anterior sides forming a very obtuse angle ; the external edges are 

 slightly convergent posteriorly. The nostrils in the middle of the two plate.?. 

 Tb.ere is one ante-orbital and two post-orbitals ; there are six labials above and 

 seven below, in addition to the rostrals. 



The ground color of this snake is a light purplish brown, with four rows of 

 large nearly circular blotches covering the whole back and sides. They are 

 arranged so as to alternate ; the outer blotches on the outer row are a little 

 larger than those on the two central ones, and are of the width of four or five 

 scales. The belly is of a pale brick red, (fading to brownish yellow in alcohol.) 

 with a well defined blotch of black near the exterior of each scale. These give 

 rise to a series of very well defined round black spots on either side of the abdo- 

 men ; and there is also an obscure series of dark blotches on the anterior edge 

 of the scales in the exterior dorsal row. The dots in this series are separated 

 by intervals of two unmarked scales. The spots of this row alternate with those 

 of the larger series immediately above. 



On separating the scales, the skin is seen to be colored like the adjacent scales. 

 It is black in the dark blotches and very light in the intermediate space, giving 

 rise to the appearance of whitish edges to the scales. 



There are thus four series of large spots on the back and sides, two on the 

 belly, and two in the exterior dorsal rows, making eight in all. The last men- 

 tioned row is sometimes very obscure, the others are always distinct. 



I refer this serpent to the genus Regina of B. and G., although it is different 

 in some respects from the other known species. It is somewhat like the R. rigida^ 

 but is differently marked ; the latter having the two abdominal rows close to- 

 gether on the middle of the belly, instead of being separated. Neither is there 




96 . [April 



any indication in R. rigida of the four series of dorsal blotches. In fact, there 

 is no North American species more strongly marked than this. 



Abdominal scales 133, the last one divided ; subcaudal 59. Dorsal ro"vvs of 

 scales 19. Length 19^ inches, of which the tail measures 4i inches. 



As yet, this species has only been detected in Northern Illinois, where it is 

 rarely met with. The few specimens obtained have been found iu the woods, 

 generally under logs. 



This snake is rather sluggish, and, like Regiiia Grahaviii of B. and G , is not 

 very pugnacious. 



In giving to this serpent the name of Dr. Kirtland, as a slight token of the 

 respect due him, to whose enthusiastic and untiring devotion to Science the 

 West owes so much, I would also make some expression of my personal grati- 

 tude to the honored teacher, whose kind encouragement and instruction led me 

 to study Nature, by dedicating to him his pupil's first contribution to Science 



Descripiion of several new genera and species of Fossil Fishes, from the Carboniferous 



Strata of Ohio. 



By J. S. Newberry, M. D. 



MECOLEPIS Newberry. 



Ileterocercal lepidoids o? small size. Body fusiform. Head obtuse. Tail 

 elongated. Lobes very unequal. Fins small and provided with delicate fulcra. 

 Dorsal opposite anal or nearly so, both set far back in body. Cranial surface 

 ornamented by corrugations, tubercles or granulations. Opercular, maxillary 

 and hyoid plates ornamented with convoluted corrugations of the surface in 

 various patterns. 



Scales smooth, or ornamented ; posterior margin of lateral scales all or in part 

 serrated. Scales of median line above and below characteristically angled or 

 crenulatcd. Two rows of scales on sides extending back to near anal fin, re- 

 markably high, vertical 2 to 5 times longitudinal diameter. 



Lateral line nearly straight, passing the upper part of lower row of high scales. 



Teeth conical, short, en brosse. 



The peculiar group of fishes to which I have given the generic name of Me- 

 eolepis, apparently represents the Palceonisci in the ichthyic fauna of the locality 

 where they occur. From Ambli/pterus and Elonichtlii/s they may readily be dis- 

 tinguished by their small fins all bearing fulcra. With Palceoniscus their affini- 

 ties are closer, but the ensemble of characters presented by the large number of 

 specimens which I have examined, seem to separate them from that genus. 

 Among these diagnostic characters the most conspicuous are their small size, 

 posterior position of dorsal fin and especially the high lateral scales.

 corrugations. Maxillary bones, oi:>ercular and hyoid plates corrugated much as 

 superior surface of head. Scales smooth, except a few on the anterior dorsal 

 surface, which are finely striate and punctate. Posterior margins of lateral 

 scales as far back as anal and dorsal fins serrated. Scales of tail, like most of 

 those of the dorsal and ventral surfaces, plain on surface and margins. Ante- 

 rior margin of anal fin opposite centre of dorsal fin; longest rays of anal fin when 

 collapsed just reaching base of caudal fin.

ELOXICHTHYS Giebel. J 



E. PELTiGEKUS, Newb. Body short, compressed. Length 5 inches. Height 

 1 in. 6 lines. Breadth 1 inch. Cephalic bones all ornamented by paral- 

 lel convolutions of thread lines. Scales all covered by similar raised lines, 

 which cross them diagonally downward and backward, terminating in serrations 

 of the posterior margins. 



About the middle of the interval between the occiput and dorsal fin, on toe 

 median line, begins a row of oval scales, four times as large as the scales of the 

 sides; ornamented in the same manner, extending in a single row along the me- 

 dian line to the dorsal fin, and behind the dorsal fin to the tail, where they are 

 transformed into the large striated fulcra, which overlie the prolongation of the 

 vertebral to its termination. 



These abnormal scales of the dorsal line are a striking peculiarity in the 

 species, and have suggested the name given it. 



CCELACANTHUS Agass. 



1. C; ROBUSTUS Newb. Body robust, 1 foot 6 inches in length. Upper sur- 

 face of cranium covered with small closely approximated tubercles; maxillaries 

 and opercula threaded with fine parallel, sometimes interrupted lines. Margins 

 of opercula in mature specimens wavy. 



Scales elliptical, thin, 7 to 9 lines in length, nearly half the surfiice exposed; 

 exposed portion covered with thread-like lines similar to those of the opercula 

 and maxillaries, and which converge toward the posterior angle of the scale.

 small, not exceeding 4 to 5 inches in length. Upper surface of head ornamented 

 with tubercles, which are much larger and more remote than in preceding 

 species. Opercula and maxillaries threaded, and like the scales having stronger

 maxillary bones threaded. All the ornamenting of head relatively stronger than 

 in C. robvMus, but less so than in C. ornatus. Scales similar in form and mark- 

 ings to those of both these species, but more delicate than either. Anterior 

 dorsal fin slightly in advance of ventrals. Posterior dorsal as much forward of

PYGOPTERUS Agass. 



P. scuTELLATUS Newb. Body fusiform, slender, 15 to 18 inches in length. 

 Head depressed. Snout pointed. Both jaws thickly set with couical. slender, 

 acute, striated teeth of unequal size. Scales very small and thick, higher than 

 long. Head and anterior portion of body covered with articiilated plates orna- 

 mented with strong, radiating, raised lines. None of my specimens show the 

 form of the caudal fin. 



This fish presents such striking differences in its scales and plates from all 

 described species of I'ygopterus^ that I have hesitated about placing it in that 

 genus. It would seem,' however, to have much in common with P. Grcmockii 

 Agass., not yet fully described.

RHIZODUS Owen. 



R. LANCiFER Newb. Teeth striated below. Section elliptical, smooth toward 

 ithe summit, where they are very much compressed, with a lenticular sectiom 

 and cutting edge on both sides. Form of summit of tooth like that of a lance 

 head. Near the apex of the tooth the cutting edge of one side is slightly gib- 

 bous, an apparent tendency toward a barbing o/ the point, as in some species 

 of Lcpidosteus. 

 ^ As usually found, the plicated base of the tooth has mostly disappeared, the 

 solid point alone remaining ; this is about an inch in length. The entire tooth 

 was more than twice that length. 



R. iNCURYDS Newb. Head massive. Superficial bones strongly tuberculated. 

 Tubercles elongated, vermicular, sometimes becoming elevated lines of a line in 

 breadth, and having a radiated arrangement. Jaws strong, both thickly set 

 .with strong ancipital curved teeth. These teeth are striated below, ellipti- 

 cal in section, and toward the summit curved backward toward the throat. They 

 are of difi'erent sizes, as in all allied fishes. The smaller teeth are G to 9 lines in 

 length and thickly set; the larger ones are much fewer in number, and more 

 than twice as long. One of the larger teeth is placed near the extremity of the 

 lower dentary bone of each side, as in R. gracilis McCoy. 



E. ANGUSTCS Newb. Laniary teeth elongatied, slender, finely striated at base, 

 smooth above, with cutting edges. Subordinate teeth half the length of the 

 larger ones. Conical, acute, striated at base, with a circular section throughout. 

 Surface of jaw coarsely tubercled. 



In this diversity of form in the teeth, this species differs from R. gracilis 

 McCoy and from R. Mibbcrii Ag., as well as from the. other species I have found 

 in Ohio. In R. incurvus N., however, the teeth have a section so nearly circular 

 Xhat there seems no good reason for separating them ;by generic distinctions. 



Of all the species of Rhizodus, which I have found, I probably have scales and 

 perhaps vertebrae and cranial plates, but as yet have been unable to find these 

 organs connected with the teeth. 



DIPLODUS Agass. 



D. coMPRESsus Newb. Teeth of moderate size, base small. Lateral denticles 

 unequally spreading, compressed, with acute points and strongly crenulated 

 edges. Central denticle very small, acute, compressed, finely crenulated on 

 margin, 



D. GRACILIS Newb. Tooth as large as D. gibboaus Agass. Base very small. 

 Lateral denticles long, curved, slender, divergent towards the points, much less 

 compressed than in preceding species, less acute, and less conspicuously crenu- 

 Sate on margins. Median denticle small, subulate, scarcely ci;enulate on margins. 



D. LATUS Newb. Teeth very large and very robust. Lateral denticles neariy 

 straight, and on the same plane, divergent, ^ to k as broad at base as long, 

 .compressed. Each margin strongly crenulated. Middle cone obsolete, or re- 

 duced to a simple knob. Base of tooth large, under surface flat. 



Ail the specimens of Diplodus from Ohio which have come under my observa- 

 tion, ntmbering some hundreds, have crenulated margins, in that respect pre- 

 :Senting a striking difference from the species described by Agassiz. 



CLADODUS Agass. 



C. acumjNatus Newb. Central denticle elongated, conical, acute ; lateral 

 denticles very acute, compressed. Base small and thin. 



CHIRODUS McCoy. 



C. ACUTUS Newb. Teeth as long as C. pes-ranx McCoj, hut more slender 

 nhraughauL Denticles more .acute^

CLIMAXODUS McCoy. 



C. BEEVis Newb. Teeth oval, in form, shorter than C imhricaius McCoj. 

 Eidges which cross- the surface more remote, with sharp crests and sinuous out- 

 line. 



PLEURACANTHUS Agass. 



P. BiSERiALis Newb. Spine straight, strong, tapering rapidly to a moderately 

 acute termination. Length four inches ; diameter at base 4 lines. Anterior 

 face rounded ; posterior face nearly flat. Entire surface finely striated longitu- 

 dinally. Sides flattened, joining posterior surface at right angles. At angle oa 

 each side a double row of small, closely set, acuminate, depressed hooks. On 

 the ujiper part of the spine the hooks are arranged in a single row. Side of spine 

 at base of the hooks marked by a distinct longitudinal furrow. 



P. ARCUATUS Newb. Spine slightly curved backward, rapidly tapering to an 

 acute point. Anterior surface rounded ; posterior face nearly flat. At angle 

 formed by the junction of sides with posterior face is, on each side, a single row 

 of closely set, acuminatCj depressed hooks. Anterior surface marked with fine 

 longitudinal striae. 



P. DILATATUS Ncwb. Spine short, robust, one inch- six lines long, straight, 

 acuminate at summit, largest nar middle, contracted at base; Anterior face 

 rounded ; posterior face flattened, and bearing at the angles on either side a 

 row of minute depressed hooks. Surface smooth. 



COMPSACANTHUS Newb. 



Spines of small size-, very neat in form and finish. Section at all points cir- 

 cular. A single row of relatively large, remote, depressed hooks it set along ths 

 posterior median line. 



Of this genus I have probably but one species. 



C. LJJvis Newb. Spine slender, curved, acuminate, having a circular section 

 at all points ; upper two-thirds furnished with a single row of depressed acumi- 

 nated hooks remotely set along median line of posterior surface.

May m, 1856. 



Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



Mr. Darand presented for publication in the Journal a paper, enti- 

 tled, " Plantse Kaneauae Arcticee et Polaris. An Enumeration of the 

 Plants collected by Dr. E. K. Kane, U. S. N., in his first and second 

 voyages to the Polar Regions, with descriptions and remarks ;" which 

 was referred to a Committee consisting of Drs. Zantziuger, Bridges, and 

 Uhler. 



Dr. Hallowell remarked that the most abundant of the urotleles in the 

 neighborhood of Philadelphia, is the Plethodon (Desmognathus, Bd.) niger, 

 which may be said to exist by thousands. It is found under stones along the 

 borders of rivulets near the banks of the Schuylkill, and is very quick in its 

 movements, its capture demanding close attention and much activity. It appears 

 to be endowed with a higher degree of vitality than the other caducibranchiates 

 with which it is associated. Its transformation is sooner effected ; specimens one 

 inch and a half in length, being without gills, while the larvaj of Pseudotriton 

 ruber are found more than three inches in length. 



The Salamandra quadrimaculata of Prof. Holbrook is identical with this 

 animal ; the red spots are observed in quite young specimens as well as those 

 more matnre, but disappear with age. It is very abundant, a large proportion 

 of the specimens being thus spotted. 



The urodeles most frequentlj^ met with in the neighborhood of Philadelphia 

 after the niger are Pseudotriton ruber and Plethodon erythronotus. The former 

 occurs in the same localities with the niger, but is much less active, though 

 perhaps more tenacious of life. The young are of a bright red color spotted 

 with lilack ; as age advances the color deepens, resembling Spanish brown 

 (maculata, Green,) and in very old specimens is of an almost purple color ; the 

 younger larvfe are white, the older olive colored with dark spots. 



At the present time, April 28th, 1856, the females of both Plethodon niger 

 and Pseudotriton ruber are distended with eggs,* as many as seventy being 

 counted in the ovaries of the former. They are of a yellow color, about a line 

 in diameter; none are to be seen in the oviducts ; the number of eggs is not 

 always the same in both ovaries, being sometimes considerably greater in one 

 than the other. The eggs in many of the specimens of Pseudotriton ruber are 

 immature, perfectly white and quite small. In the stomach of one of the 

 latter a large lumbricus was found, in another the remains of a coleopterous 

 insect, and in a third the tail and posterior extremities of a Salamander, proba- 

 bly a young Plethodon niger. 



Spelerpes (Cylindrosoma, Tsch.) bilineata, is found in the same neighborhood, 

 and also Plethodon erythronotus, the latter under stones, at some distance from 

 the water, associated with Plethodon cinereus. In one specimen the stripe along 

 the back was of a beautiful pink color.

Mr. Charles E. Smith remarked in relation to the specimens of iron 

 ore presented by himself this evening, that the three leading varieties 

 of the ore, known as the Baltimore ore, were shown in the specimens. 

 The bed lies on the west side of Chesapeake Bay, runs parallel with it, 

 and is about fifty miles long. It is of white clay underlying the Eocene 

 deposit. The ore lies in nodules like the brown hsematite. In the most 

 valuable bed, this ore is associated with large quantities of mineral 

 charcoal, which seems to be always in broken masses. Mr. S. bad never 

 seen any traces of plants. There is no other deposit of iron ore in the 

 neighborhood. The iron made from this ore is remarkable for its great 

 strength. Mr. S. considered the deposit as remarkable, being the only 

 one of which he was aware, in which the lithoid carbonate of iron exists 

 out of the coal measures. 



May 20lh. 

 Mr. Ord, President, in the Chair. 



Dr. Bridges, referring to the specimens of lithoid carbonate of iron 

 exhibited at the last meeting, gave the following as the probable theory 

 of the formation of this ore. Iron pyrites by exposure would be con- 

 verted into a sulphate of the protoxide with some sesquioxide of iron. 

 By contact with lime these oxides would be precipitated, the protoxide 

 rapidly becoming sesquioxide. The contact of organic matter would 

 reduce the sesquioxide again to protoxide, which would combine with 

 the carbonic acid evolved during the fermentation of the organic matter. 



Mr. Cassin announced the arrival in this country and the presence 

 this evening of the Baron Von Miiller, who proposes to visit Texas, 

 Mexico, and Central America, and who is desirous of afibrding to the 

 Academy any aid in his power. 



Dr. Leidy remarked that he had just returned from a visit to St. 

 Louis, and thought that the members would be gratified to learn that 

 an " Academy of Science " had been organized in that city, whose ob- 

 jects were similar to our own. The Academy commences under the 

 most promising prospects ; and it occupies a highly favorable position 

 in our country for the formation of a cabinet of natural history. It 

 has recently received a large and very valuable collection of fossils, ob- 

 tained by Dr. F. V. Ilayden from the region of the Upper Missouri.

The collection consists of numerous remains of Mammalia and Clielonia 

 from the Mauvaises Terres of Nebraska, a large number of mollusca 

 from the cretaceous beds, and an extensive series of plants from a ter- 

 tiary formation. Dr. C A. Pope, with his usual liberality, has granted 

 the Academy the use of a large hall furnished with cases, for the pur- 

 poses of a museum, in the Medical College. The president of the 

 Academy, than whom none could be more worthy, is Dr. George Engle- 

 man. In conclusion, Dr L. offered in furtherance of the objects of 

 the new Academy the following :

Dr. Hallowell remarked that we had recently received Ihrough Mr. Vogt, a 

 large collection of living specimens of Siernothaerus odoratus, Holb., from the 

 neighborhood of Poiladelphia, more than thirty in number. Many of them 

 present important characteristics not hitherto noticed. The larger as well as a 

 number of the smaller specimens, are of a chocolate brown or olive color 

 above upon tbe carapax, with numerous blacii spots, the sternum brown, micgled 

 with yellow ; iris golden ; upper part of head olive, with numerous small dark 

 colored macukc ; two yellow vittte, passing one above, the other beneath the eye; 

 barbels in both sexes. The differences between the male and the female are 

 strongly marked, and may be presented as follows :

 ral of the plates tipped with yellowish ; marginal scutes narrow, except the t( ur 

 posterior, which are broad (Adult.) In younger specimens the yellow lines 

 above and below the eyes are manifest; shell ash, spotted with black ; sternum 

 yellow, mingled v^ith black, sometimas without spots; very young specimens 

 with radiating lines of black upon ttie carapax ; length of shell 3 inches 10 lines. 



Var. a. Carapax olive, with numerous black spots ; posterior terminal mar- 

 ginal plates larger than the others ; an orange-colored line above and one below 

 the eyes ; iris golden ; sternum yellow and black mingled ; soft parts ash colored, 

 with a tinge of red and yellow; younger specimens presenting the same general 

 appearance; shell inclining to brown above; sternum yellow. (K. guttatum, 

 LeConte.) 



Length of shell 3 inches 7 lines. 



Var. /?. Shell dark Spanish brown above, with numerous dark colored spots; 

 sternum black, mingled with yellow ; soft parts greyish. 



Length of shell 4 inches 4 lines. 



The Kinosternum guttatum of Major LeConte appears to be a variety of 

 Staurotypus odoratus, var. a. Dr. Holbrook's plate represents a young ash- 

 colored female. Schoepf's figure is also that of a female more advanced but not 

 fully grown. (Tab. 24, ,g.) Hist. Testudinum. Erlangae, 1752.* 



We believe Dumeril and Bibron to be right in putting the animal above de- 

 scribed in the genus Staurotypus. 



Cinosternon penusylvanicum differs from Staurotypus odoratus in the much 

 greater mobility of the posterior portion of the sternum, the animal being able 

 to close itself up, almost like a box tortoise, in the greater extent therefore to 

 which the sternum covers the ventral surface, in the marked differences in the 

 shape of the sternal scutes, which, with the exception of the abdominal, are more 

 or less triangular in penusylvanicum, in the larger size of the inguinal plates, 

 in the shape and coloration of the head, in the form and arrangement of the 

 posterior marginal plates, and in the configuration of the carapax. 



Staurotypus-j- belongs to the family of Elodites of Dum. and Bib., orPaludine 

 Turtles, which are placed immediately after the Chersites or Land Tortoises. 

 These are subdivided into two subfamilies the Cryptoderes and Pleuroderes 

 the first having the power of withdrawing the neck under the middle of the cara- 

 pax. It comprises seven genera, viz.: Cistuda, Emys, Tetronyx, Platysternon, 

 Emysaurus, Staurotypus and Cinosternon. 



The second sub-family, or that of the Pleuroderes, which have the power of 

 withdrawing the neck to one of the sides of the anterior opening of the carapax, 

 and never completely between the arms and under the middle of the carapax, as 

 in the Cryptoderes. comprises a'so seven genera, viz., Peltocephalus, Poducne- 

 mis, Pentonyx, S/ernotheerus, Platemys, Chelodina, Chelys. It will be observed, 

 therefore, that Staurotypus and Sternothjierus belong to different subfamilies, for 

 which reason we prefer to designate this animal as Dumeril and Bibron have done 

 by W agler's name of Staurotypus, the latter being a Cryptodere ; besides, Sterno- 

 th^erus has no nuchal plate, and is destitute of axillary and inguinal plates. 

 The marginal scutes are 24 in number. The sternum is not cruciform, as in 

 Staurotypus, the anterior valve (the only one) and the abdominal plates en- 

 closing the animal leaving the posterior parts more or less exposed, the poste- 

 rior part of the sternum being immoveable, or nearly so, as in Staurotypus. 

 Dumeril and Bibron also point out an anatomical difference of importance be- 

 tween the Cryptoderes and Pleuroderes, viz., that in the latter the pelvis is solidly 

 fixed to both the sternum and carapax ; whereas, in the former, it is " articulated 

 to the internal face of the carapax by a cartilaginous symphisis, corresponding to 

 the sacral bf^ne, being entirely free towards the sternum, permitting several of

these Chelonians to move slightly this portion of their bony apparatus." The 

 celebrated authors above mentioned describe but two species of Staurotypus, 

 viz., triporcatus and odoratus. Of the former we have a specimen from the 

 river Medelin, in Mexico, the carapax of which, measures 11 inches (Fr.) in length 

 and 7 in breadth, being much larger than the specimen in the Jardin des Plantes. 

 The sternum is cruciform and has but 7 pUites, there being eleven in odoratus. 

 but when we consider that these animals correspond in the shape of the head, 

 the general configuration of the shell, and the form of the sternum, these differ- 

 ences may be considered specific, and not generic. The following are the cha- 

 racters of Siaurotypus, Cinosternon and Sternothaerus, as given by Dumeril and 

 Bibron, (Tome ll/pp. 354, 361 and 39G.)

Descriptions of three Myriapoda. 



By Ab. Sager. 



CRASPEDOSOMAD^, Gray. 



Gen. Reasia? Gr. 



Sp. R. SPiNOSA, Nob. Body consists of sixty or sixty-one segments, exclusive 

 of the head and ultimate bivalve scale. Segments all marked with sharp longi- 

 tudinal ridges, the size of which vary considerably. On each side and between 

 the mesial line and stigmata, are seven nearly equal ridges, that border the 

 mesial line somewhat lower than the rest. On the sides are three larger ones 

 terminated with spines, between which there are two smaller and spineless ones; 

 the superior spinous ridge is semi-double and connected with the stigmata ; 

 below these are nine or ten smaller ridges, gradually diminishing as they ap- 

 proach the basis of the feet; anterior and posterior segments about equal to the 

 adjoining ones, head glabrous ; eyes a black triangular patch at the outer base 

 of the antennae ; body cylindrical, chesnut brown, with a paler dorsal line 

 covering the two dorsal ridges, and a pale lateral line covering the series of the 

 stigmata ; feet and antennte rufous. Differs from the Reasia of Gray in eyes, 

 in a triangular instead of a linear spot, and from the Cylindrosoma of the same 

 author in the distinctness of the ridges and not having a reniform eye spot. 



Nearly allied to the Julus lactarius of Say. 



Gen. Stenonia, Gr. 



Sp. S. HispiDA, Nob. Body composed of seventeen double segments, dis- 

 tincly divided on the dorsal mesial line. Body depressed, margins of segments 

 quite prominent and curved forwards near the head, in the middle and poste- 

 riorly transverse or curved slightly backwards. Surface of each segment covered 

 with five rows of distinct tubercles, arranged somewhat in quincuncial order. 

 From the direction of the tubercles the lateral and posterior margins of each 

 segment appear serrated. First cervical segment smaller than the next, rounded 

 anteriorly, straight and narrower behind, and obliquely truncated on the sides. 

 The posterior segment about equal to the next in length, is triangular, the apex 

 armed with a stiff hair. Color pale red above, feet and ventral surface flesh 

 colored. 



Length Q'". Under decayed logs. 



Gen. Strigamia, Gr. 



Sp. S. fulva, Nob. Body somewhat depressed, slightly narrowed towards 

 the extremities, smooth above, rough and villous on the sides and beneath ; feet 

 hairy ; posterior pair equal in length and twice as large as the next; antennal 

 segments obconical, except the last, which is elliptical, and as long as the two 

 preceding ones. Alternate dorsal scut form a slight, obtuse, lateral process. 

 Color fulvous tibove, fawn colored on the sides and beneath. 



Approximates closely to the Geophilus rubens of Say.

' Desa-iptions of New Species of Acephala and Gasteropcda., from the Tertiary forma- 

 tions of Nebraska Territory, loith some general remarks on the Geology of the 

 country about the sources of the 3fissouri River. 



By F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, M. D. 



That portion of the great Tertiary basin from which the fossils described in 

 the following- paper were obtained, occupies an extensive area of country near 

 the head waters of the Missouri, chiefly between the 46th and 49th parallels of 

 north latitude, and the 100th, and 108th degree of longitude west from Green- 

 wich. According to the Barometrical measurements made by the party charged 

 with the exploration of the proposed northern route of the Pacific railroad, this 

 district varies in its elevation from 1800 to 2700 feet above the present flow of 

 the tidal wave.* 



In regard to the geographical, topographical, and phj'sical features of this 

 country, its native tribes, its botany, zoology, &c., much interesting information 

 was long since laid before the public by the reports of Lewis and Clark's and 

 Long's expeditions, by Mr. Catlin, the Prince of New Wied, Mr. Nuttall and 

 others. More recently, much information of a similar nature has been added by 

 the report of the Pacific Railroad Survey. All these enterprising travellers 

 mention the occurrence of sandstones, clays, lignite, &c., but without giving us 

 much information in regard to the age of these formations, the extent of country 

 occupied by them, or as to the character of their organic remains. 



In 1849 Dr. John Evans traced a great Lignite formation from below Fort Clark, 

 along the Missouri to a point twenty miles below the mouth of the Yellow Stone; 

 and in 1850 Mr. Thaddcus A. Culbertson, who visited this country under the 

 patronage of the Smithsonian Institution, saw this formation at two or three 

 points above Fort Union. In a map accompanying a highly interesting memoir 

 on the geology of the Hudson's Bay Territories, published recently by Mr. A. K. 

 Isbister, in the Journal of the Geological Society of London, a large area about 

 the sources of the Missouri, is colored as Tertiary, but so as to convey an in- 

 correct idea of the extent of country occupied by it. About the same time, Mr. 

 Jules .Marcou published in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of France, a 

 memoir on the Geology of the United States and the British Provinces, accom- 

 l^anied by a map, on which he colors nearly all the country about the headwaters 

 of the Missouri as New Red Sandstone, surmounted along the west shore of that 

 stream by Cretaceous outliers. Between this and the Black Hills he brings up 

 to Cannon-ball River, from the White River basin, a continuous belt of Tertiary. 

 West of this he places a belt of Jurassic, and along the supposed position of 

 the Black Hills he runs a stripe of Eruptive and Metamorphic rocks, flanked on 

 the east and west by Carboniferous formations. On the west side of the Black 

 Hills he colors another extensive district of Jurassic. In all this Mr. Marcou 

 is certainly mistaken, excepting in regard to the Eruptive and Metamorphic rocks 

 of the Black Hills ; there may also be Carboniferous formations tliere, but 

 they have not yet been recognized as far north by two or three hundred miles, 

 as laid down by him. 



Leaving for a future occasion all local and other details, we now propose to 

 give a brief general sketch of the extent and boundaries, as far as we can, of 

 that porticn of the great Tertiary lignite formation from which our fossils were 

 collected, with a few remarks wpon its probable age, and relations to the White 

 river basin, as well as to the Cretaceous formations upon which it reposes. 



* Some points not crossed by these explorers may be a few hundred feet higher. 




112 [June, 



Ascending the Missouri from Fort Pierre, we find on reaching a point five miles 

 below Heart river, about the 47th parallel north, that the Cretaceous formations 

 which are so conspicuous for many hundred miles along the river below, pass 

 by a gentle north or north-west dip beneath the water level, to be succeeded on 

 both sides of the river by Tertiary. Although this is the first point where the 

 Tertiary beds come down to the water level, they are known to occupy the higher 

 country back from the river, on the west side, as far south as the vicinity of 

 Sau-acanna or Moreau river, and still further west they go as far south as some 

 of the north-west branches of the Cheyenne. Cannon-ball river, Watahoo, and 

 other small tributaries, however, cut down to the Cretaceous beds some little 

 distance back from the Missouri. On the east side of the ]\lissouri the Tertiary 

 is bounded on the south, nearly opposite the mouth of Cannon-ball river, by a 

 range of upper Cretaceous hills bearing off to the north east. South of the 

 Moreau, a similar range, known as Fox Hills, extends from near the Missouri to 

 about the 102 of west longitude, where it is interrupted by a small tributary 

 of the Cheyenne. West of this small stream, the same range of upper Cretaceous 

 hills, known perhaps by other local names, bears round to the north-west, 

 crossing the head branches of the Little Missouri so as to strike the Yellow Stone 

 river about ten miles below the mouth of Powder river ; forming nearly all this 

 distance the south and south-west boundaries of that portion of the great Ter- 

 tiary basin lying in the immense bend formed by the Missouri and Yellow Stone 

 rivers. To comprehend how this range of hills could traverse the country in 

 this way, it must be borne in mind that the Black Hills are laid down on most 

 of the published maps of this country as extending a long distance too far north. 



Returning to the point near Heart river, from which we first set out, we find 

 on ascending the Missouri, that the Cretaceous strata again rise to view at a few 

 points not far below Fort Clark, but even here the country on each side is com- 

 posed of Tertiary. It was at one of these localities the Prince of Kew Wied 

 collected a nearly entire skeleton of Mosasaurus Maximiliani (Goldf.) From the 

 vicinity of Fort Clark we know of no other place where the Cretaceous beds 

 make their appearance until about twelve miles below the mouth of Milk river, 

 (lat. 47 N. long. 104 W.) the country on both sides of the Missouri all this 

 great distance being made up of Tertiary formations, the northern and eastern 

 limits of which are unknown to us. Immediately along the margins of Milk 

 river, Cretaceous beds are seen on both sides as far up as we have any knowledge 

 of the country, though the higher country back from the river is Tertiary. From 

 the point below the mouth of this stream on the Missouri, where the Cretaceous 

 beds first make their appearance, they are seen to rise higher and higher as we 

 ascend the ?iIissouri, in consequence of their inclination to the east or north-east. 

 On the north side of the Missouri, between it and Milk river, the higher portions 

 of the country back from the Missouri, are also composed of Tertiary beds. 



The same formations likewise occupy nearly all the country between the Mis- 

 souri and Yellow Stone, as far west as the vicinity of Muscleshell river, where 

 they thin out on the summits of Cretaceous hills. The hills, however, near the 

 Missouri, between Milk and Muscleshell rivers, are also mainly Cretaceous, the 

 Tertiary being for the most part worn away by atmospheric agencies. 



On both sides of the Yellow Stone, only Tertiary strata are seen from near the 

 mouth of Powder river as far up as the mouth of the Big Horn. How far be- 

 yond this they extend we do not know, though we have received Tertiary fossils 

 from intellisfent traders, collected as far up the Big Horn as one of its tributaries 

 known as Little Horn river. From another point as far west on the Yellow 

 Stone as Rose river, we received a few Cretaceous fossils. As to the limits of 

 the Tertiary up Powder and Tongue rivers, we have no definite information. 

 The traders say the same kind of lignite beds seen along the Yellow Stone, occur 

 along the l)anks of the former as much as one hundred and fifty miles above its 

 mouth. 



The foregoing hasty sketch is given more with a view of showing the extent 

 of country occupied by this great Tertiary lignite formation, than with any 

 hope of conveying a definite idea of its precise limits. If it should prove to be 




1856.] 113 



only a part of the same extensive fresh water lignite formation observed by Sir 

 John Richardson on the Saskatchawan, of which we have little doubt, then it 

 is highly probable the Lignite and Goal formations mentioned by Mr. Isbister as 

 flanking the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, in the form of a continuous 

 belt from the Saskatchawan to the Arctic Ocean, belong to the same epoch. 



For the most part, these deposits in Nebraska consist of beds of gray, yel- 

 lowish, whitish, and blue sand, sandstone, clay, &c., with alternating strata of 

 lignite of variable purity, and carbonaceous matter mingled with much sand 

 and clay. These beds of lignite often take fire spontaneously, from heat gene- 

 rated in the decomposition of iron pyrites, and burn for many years at a time, 

 sending forth suffocating sulphurous vapors, and causing such an intense degree 

 of heat as to fuse the contiguous clay and sand into masses presenting every de- 

 gree of compactness, from that of obsidian to light vesicular lava. In some of 

 the argillaceous beds, great numbers of beautiful fossil plants are found, a fine 

 series of which was collected and placed for investigation in the hands of Dr. 

 J. S. Newberry, the well known fossil botanist of Cleveland, Ohio. The remains 

 of Mollusca collected from these formations, over a wide extent of countrj-, pre- 

 sent a remarkable uniformity of character, and as maybe seen by the following 

 paper, are all, excepting a few land shells, referable to genera usually found in 

 fresh and brackish waters. It is an interesting fact that the most nearly allied 

 living representatives of many of these species are now found inhabiting the 

 streams of Southern Africa, Asia, China, and Siam, apparently indicating the 

 existence of a tropical climate in these latitudes at as late a period as the Tertiary 

 epoch.* 



Although there can be no doubt that these deposits hold a rather low position 

 in the Tertiary System, we have as yet been able to arrive at no very definite 

 conclusions as to their exact synchronism with any particular minor subdivision 

 of Tertiary, not having been able to identify any of the Mollusca found in 

 them with those of any well marked geological horizon in other countries. 

 Their general resemblance to the fossils of the Woolwich and Reading series of 

 English geologists, as well as to those of the great Lignite formations of the 

 south-east of France, would seem to point to the lower Eocene as their jjosition. 

 Yet it may be possible these resemblances have resulted from the action of pre- 

 cisely similar causes at a somewhat later period. 



It is a little remarkable that these formations differ in many respects from 

 those of the White river basin lying so near on the south. In the first place they 

 generally contain more sand, are usually characterized by beds of lignite, and 

 as yet have furnished no remains of Mammalia ; while the White river basin is 

 more argillaceous, appears to be destitute of lignite, and is well known to be one 

 of the most remarkable repositories of extinct mammalian remains on the face 

 of the globe. In addition to this, not one of the species of Mollusca in our col- 

 lection from the Lignite formations, is identical with any of those described by 

 Dr. Evans and Dr. Shumard from the White river basin. 



Formations immediately beneath the Tertiary in this district. 

 It would seem that the change of physical conditions which closed the Cre- 

 taceous epoch and ushered in the Tertiary, in this part of the world at least, was 

 gradual, not violent. We find that even while the Cretaceous conditions still 

 existed, (during the deposition of No. 5 of the seriesf ) the approaching close of 

 that state of things, and tlie coming of the Tertiary era, were foreshadowed by 

 the introduction of Fasciolaria^ Pleurotoma, and Belemnitella, with many shells of 

 other genera, quite as near in their specific affinities to Tertiary as to Cretaceous 



* We are under many obligations to Dr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, for the 

 privilege of comparing our fossil species with analogous forms in his magnifi- 

 cent collection of recent shells.

forms ; while the sea was gradually becoming more shallow, as is shown by the 

 increase of gasteropoda. We even know from the presence of a few remains of 

 lycopodiaceous plants, and an occasional unbroken leaf of some exogenous tree, 

 that there was dry land at this time somewhere not very far away. Gradually, 

 as we ascend in the series, the strictly marine animals disappear, and we meet 

 with Ostrea, Corbula, and Ceriihium, mingled in the same bed with Mclania, Palu- 

 dina, Physa, Cyrena^ &c., all of Tertiary types; while a little higher in the 

 series, we find at some places only the remains of land and fresh water mollusca. 

 From the above facts, especially the presence of Pleurotoma, Fasciolaria, and 

 Belemnitclla, in this upper member of the Cretaceous system of this country, 

 we cannot think it represents any part of the Green Sand of English geologists. 

 Numerous well marked Cretaceous forms show it cannot be Tertiary, conse- 

 quently we think it must represent some portion of the true Chalk. We are by 

 no means inclined, however, to adopt the views of M. Alcide D'Orbiguy, 

 who regards all the Cretaceous formations of the United States and Western 

 Territories as referable to a later epoch than the Green Sand, as the next suc- 

 ceeding formation below that of which we have just been speaking, (No. 4 of 

 the series), is characterized by numerous fossils of unquestionable Green Sand 

 type. We think confusion has been created in tracing out the parallelism be- 

 tween American and European Cretaceous formations, by fossils from different 

 positions in this country having been mingled together and described as if they 

 occurred in the same bed. 



Formations at the base of the Cretaceous Scries of this district. 



As previously stated, near the mouth of Milk river, Cretaceous strata which 

 are not seen for a long distance below this on the Missouri, again rise to vievi'. 

 They consist of the upper two members of the series (No. 5 and No. 4) which, 

 in consequence of their inclination to the east, are found to rise higher and 

 higher as we ascend the river, so that nearly all the hills close to the Missouri, 

 between Milk and Muscleshell rivers, consist of these formations. Some four or 

 five miles below the mouth of Muscleshell river, a lower rock, a sandstone, 

 rises above the water level. This is probably No. 1 of the series. No. 2 and No. 

 3 not being represented here. It is worthy of note that out of two species of 

 Mactra^ two of Tellina, two of Inoceramus, one of Pholodomya, two of Nat/ca, and 

 one Bacuiite, found in this rock, not one is known to occur in any of the higher 

 formations, and some of these species are not unlike Neocomicn forms. 



In consequence of the increasing inclination of the strata, this last mentioned 

 sandstone rises in the vicinity of North Mountain river as much as 250 feet above 

 the Missouri. Here, or near this, begins a wild and desolate region, known as 

 the Mauvaises Torres or Bad Lands of the Judith. At various places in these Bad 

 Lands a sandstone similar to No. 1 was seen alternating with beds of clay and 

 lignite, all of which are upheaved and much distorted. It was found impossible 

 to devote to the examination of these formations time enough to determinetheir 

 relations to the Cretaceous and Tertiary strata of this region, without running 

 the risk of being cut off from the party and murdered by the Indians. Amongst 

 a few fossils that were collected here, however, Prof. Leidy finds teeth which 

 he refers to two or three genera of large Saurians allied to the Iguanodon, 

 Megalosaurus, &c. There arc also in the collection from some of these beds, one 

 or two species of Unio, one or more of Cyclas or Cyrcna, and a few crushed 

 specimens of Gasteropoda like Paludina and Mclania. From these facts, we are 

 strongly inclined to think with Prof. Leidy, there may be here, at the ba.' e of the 

 Cretaceous System, a fresh water formation like the Wealden. In as much, how- 

 ever, as there certainly are some outliers of fresh water Tertiary in these Bad 

 Lands, we would suggest that it is barely possible these remains may belong to 

 that ei)och, though the shells appear to be all distinct species from those found 

 in the Tertiary at all the other localities in this region. 



We remember seeing in 1853, between the mouth of Big Sioux and Piatt 

 rivers on the Missouri, some exposures very similar to those of the Bad Lands 

 of the Judith, excepting that there appeared to be no beds of Lignite. We saw 




1856.] 115 



no fossils ill these beds, but were at that time impressed with the opinion that 

 they belonged to the lower part of No. 1, which is well exposed a little higher 

 up the river at the mouth of the Big Sioux, but soon dips beneath the water 

 level to be seen no more between there and the far distant point already men- 

 tioned, near the mouth of Muscleshell river.* 



DESCRIPTIONS OF SPECIES. 



CyCLAS FORMOSA. 



Shell small, oval, oblique, scarcely ventricose ; cardinal margin straight 

 buccal end rounded ; anal extremity obliquely truncate ; basal margin semi-el- 

 liptical or broadly rounded ; beaks obtuse, tumid, rising somewhat above the 

 hinge, nearly touching, placed a little in advance of the middle ; surface orna- 

 mented by very fine, regular, distinct, concentric wrinkles. Length .11 inch ; 

 breadth .08 inch ; height .14 inch. 



Locality. Three miles above Fort Union. 



Cyclas pragilis. 



Shell small, subcircular, slightly oblique, scarcely ventricose, very thin and 

 fragile ; extremities and base rounded ; posterior end wider than the anterior ; 

 beaks moderately elevated, tumid, slightly in advance of the centre ; surface ap- 

 parently marked with fine indistinct lines of growth. Length .24 inch ; breadth 

 about .13 inch ; height .22 inch. 



All our specimens of this species being more or less worn, it is possible the 

 lines of growth may be more distinct on perfect specimens. Sometimes the 

 posterior slope, from a little behind the beaks, appear to have been obliquely 

 subtruncate. 



Locality. Same as last. 



Cyclas subellipticds. 



Shell small, elliptical-ovate, somewhat ventricose, thin and fragile ; posterior 

 end narrower than the anterior, both narrowly rounded ; base semi-elliptical or 

 semi-ovate ; cardinal border apparently rounding gradually to both extremities ; 

 beaks not much elevated, pointed, incurved, not oblique, located near the 

 middle ; surface indistinctly marked with lines of growth. Length -24 inch ; 

 height -14 inch. 



The beaks are so near the middle, and curved so nearly at right angles to the 

 longitudinal diameter of the shell, that it is not easy to determine, especially 

 from the examination of mutilated specimens, which is the posterior, or which 

 the anterior end. As we have only seen imperfect specimens, we are not sure 

 the surface markings are indistinct on unworn shells. 



Ijocality. Three miles above Fort Union. 



Cyrena Moreauensis. 



Shell ovate, nearly elliptical, compressed, extremities rounded; anterior end 

 narrower than the posterior, base semi-ovate, most promincntbehind the middle; 

 beaks not much elevated, placed a little in advance of the centre ; surface marked 

 with fine distinct lines of growth ; cardinal edge rather thick, and having under 

 the beaks three diverging central teeth in each valve, the anterior of which is the 

 smallest ; lateral teeth two, (in the left valve) long, parallel to the cardinal edge, 

 and fitting into corresponding grooves in the other valve ; muscular impressions 

 deep. Length about -90 inch ; breadth -36 inch ; height -66 inch. 



Each of the cardinal teeth has, in its upper end, a small notch which is occu- 

 pied, when the valves are closed, by a small projection between the teeth of the 

 other valve. The anterior lateral tooth appears to be larger and approaches the 

 central teeth more nearly than the posterior. Our specimens are generally more 

 or less worn, and thickly coated with firmly adhering sand. 



* The foregoing remarks are based upon the observations and collections of 

 Dr. Hayden. 




116 [June, 



Locality. Near Moreau river, in a sand bed, associated with bones of Titano- 

 thcrium? Probably a distant outlier of the White river bone beds. 



Ctrena inteemedea. 



Shell oval-ovate, compressed, rather thin ; estremities'rounded ; base semi- 

 elliptical ; beaks moderately elevated, not gibbous, placed nearly half way from 

 the middle to the anterior end ; surface marked with fine lines of growth, oc- 

 casionally rising into obscui-e concentric wrinkles ; edge of the cardinal border 

 thin ; cardinal teeth close under the beaks, posterior one very oblique. Length 

 76 inch ; breadth -22 inch ; height -68 inch. 



Thisspecies approaches some varieties of C.^M??),of Deshay's(Coq.foss. page 

 ll^,) but is more inequilateral, the posterior end being comparatively longer, 

 the beaks are also less elevated. From the last it will be distinguished by its 

 shorter and more rounded form, more elevated beaks, and much thinner cardinal 

 edge. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Cyrena occidentalis. 



Shell sub-triangular, very thick, rather ventricose ; anterior end and base 

 rounded, posterior end sloping abruptly fi'om the beaks, and ventrically sub- 

 truncate at the extremity ; beaks located a little in advance of the middle, and 

 elevated, pointed, incurved, and approximate ; surface marked with strong 

 lines of growth. Length 1 inch; breadth -71 inch; height 1 inch. 



Appears to be intermediate between C cordata of Morris {Proceed. Geol. So- 

 ciety, vol. 10, joZ. Ijfifjs. 7, 8, 9,) and C. antiqua of Ferussac, {see Deshays' Coq. foss., 

 pi. 18, figs. 19,20,21) both of which are Eocene species. From the first, it dif- 

 fers in being relatively higher ; its posterior end is also shorter, and more dis- 

 tinctly subtruncate. From the latter, it differs in being less elevated, not so 

 concave in front of the beaks, nor so regularly arcuate on the posterior slope 

 from the beaks to the base. In front, it presents the same symmetrical cordate 

 outline common to both these species. 



Locality. Bad Lands of the Judith. 



CORBDLA SUBTRIGONALIS. 



Left valve subtrigonal, very convex, obliquely truncate from the beaks to the 

 extremities, the two slopes diverging at an angle of 95''; basal margin rounding 

 up abruptly in front, and converging towards the postei-ior slope at an angle of 

 about 48; beaks elevated, located in advance of the middle ; surface marked by 

 faint lines of growth, and having below the middle three or four concentric 

 wrinkles, which become stronger towards the extremities. The right valve is 

 much more compressed, and without concentric folds. Length -74 inch ; breadth 

 25 inch ; height -55 inch. 



The larger, or left valve of this species, has an obscure ridge passing from the 

 beaks obliquely backwards and downwards to the posterior extremity, along 

 which the valve is abruptly deflected towards the hinge margin. This and the 

 foUowino- species may have possessed other surface markings not now preserved, 

 the specimens being all considerably worn, as if they had been exposed to the 

 action of waves on a beach. 



Locality. Mouth of the Judith, associated with Oslrea svbtrigonalis (Evans and 

 Shumarci), also Melania, raludina, and other fresh water shells. 



CORBULA PERDNDATA. 



PJo-ht valve sub-trigonal, rather compressed, obliquely sub-truncate from the 

 beaks toward both extremities, the slopes diverging at an angle of about 82 ; 

 basal margin rounding up in front, straight towards the posterior ; beaks small, 

 much elevated, and placed a little in advance of the middle; surface ornament- 

 ed by five or six strong, elevated, concentric folds, otherwise apparently smooth. 

 Length ^32 inch; breadth -13 inch; height -27 inch. 



The left valve of this species is yet unknown to us. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 




1856.] 117 



CORBULA MACTRIPORMIS. 



Shell subtriangular, scarcely ventricose ; right valve a little larger, thicker 

 and more gibbous than the left ; extremities narrowly rounded ; posterior end 

 longer than the anterior, slightly truncate at the extremity, and having an ob- 

 tuse ridge passing from the beaks obliquely backwards to the lower posterior 

 edge ; base semi-ovate, most prominent in advance of the middle ; beaks con- 

 siderably elevated, pointed, incurved, and directed forward ; surface marked with 

 fine line's of growth. Length -64 inch ; breadth about -33 inch ; height -50 inch. 



The tooth of the right valve is thick, and located immediately under the 

 beaks, while that of the left is flattened, and placed a little behind them. 

 The lateral edges of the cardinal border of the left valve, as well as its basal 

 margin, which are sharp and prominent, fit into a distinct groove in the edge of 

 the opposite valve. The muscular im jressions are indistinct, and the sinus of 

 the palleal impression triangular, very broad and shallow. 



Locality. Fort Clark, where it is associated with Melania, Paludina, &c. 



Unio priscus. 



Shell ovate, rather compressed, very thin and fragile ; anterior extremity 

 short, rounded ; posterior end narrower, contracting with a regular curve from 

 above, and having at the extremity below a very obtusely rounded angle ; car- 

 dinal border broadly arcuate ; basal margin nearly straight behind the middle, 

 rounding up in front ; beaks very small, rising little above the hinge, located 

 about one-sixth the entire length of the shell behind the front, and ornamented 

 with small regular concentric wrinkles ; surface of other portions of the shell 

 smooth, or only marked with fine lines of growth. Length 2-78 inches; breadth 

 unknown ; height 1-63 inches. 



Has much the aspect externally of an Anodonta, but a fragment in our collec- 

 tion shows enough of the hinge to prove it to be a Unto, without exhibiting the 

 details of the teeth. Judging from the beaks, young specimens not more than 

 half an inch in length must be beautifully ornamented with regular concentric 

 wrinkles. It is usually found in a crushed condition between the laminae of 

 clay. 



Locality. Yellowstone River, forty miles above the mouth. 



BULIMUS ? TERES. 



Shell small, sinistral, much elongated, terete ; volutions ten to ten and a half, 

 narrow, closely wound, and increasing very gradually from the apex, slightly 

 convex near the summit of the spire, but flattened lower down ; suture very 

 faintly impressed between the lower volutions, but becoming more distinct to- 

 wards the apex ; surface marked with fine, regular lines of growth, passing 

 straight across the whorls at right angles to the suture ; aperture ovate, acutely 

 angular above, rounded below ; lip thin. Length -76 inch; breadth -19 inch; 

 apical angle slightly convex, divergence 18. 



A few dextral shells were found associated with the above, which, as far as 

 we have been able to see, diifer from them in no other respect. It is possible, 

 however, they may belong to a distinct species, though we are now inclined to 

 regard them as merely a variety of the same. This and the following species 

 are evidently closely related to a shell described by M. Matheron, from the Ter- 

 tiary lignites near the mouth of the Rhone, south-east of France. (See Melania 

 adcula, p, 219, pi. 36, fig. 25 ; Catalogue Methodique, &c.) Like some of ours, his 

 is a sinistral shell, and has much the same general appearance, but it is even 

 more elongated, and has nearly twice as many volutions. We doubt very mnch 

 the propriety of referring such forms to the genus Melania., as they appear to us 

 to have much more the aspect of land shells. Unfortunately all our specimens 

 have the aperture more or less broken or distorted, as was the case with those 

 studied by M. Matheron. The spire looks very like Clausilia, but the aperture 

 was evidently more like Bulimus or Achatina. It is not improbable they may 



9 




118 [June, 



form a distinct group, holding an intermediate position between Clausilia and 

 Bulimus. 



Locality. Three miles below Fort Union. 



BULIMCS? VBRMICOLUS. 



Shell small, sinistral^ greatly elongated, cylindrical ; volutions about thirteen, 

 narrow, closely wound, increasing very gradually from the apex, somewhat con- 

 vex near the summit of the spirefbut flatteaed lower down; suture very faintly 

 impressed between the lower volutions, bat becoming more distinct above ; sur- 

 face marked with fine regular Hues of growth passing straight across the whorls 

 at right angles to the suture; aperture unknown. Length about -60 inch; 

 breadth -13 inch ; apical angle slightly convex, divergence 13. 



This is very near the last, and may be only a variety of the same. It differs, 

 however, in being more nearly cylindrical in form; the volutions are more nu- 

 merous, more closely wound, and do not increase so rapidly from the apes, 

 while the suture is less oblique, especially between the lower volutions. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Bulimus limneaformis. 



Shell narrow ovate, rather thick; spire conical, obtuse at the apex; volutions 

 Sve to five and a half, convex ; suture distinct ; surface marked with faint lines 

 of growth ; aperture ovate, angular above, rounded below; outer lip apparently 

 a little obtuse, or abruptly bevelled ; inner lip very thin on the body whorl above, 

 thicker and slightly reflexed below; columella regularly curved. Length -42 

 inch ; breadth -ZO inch; length of aperture -20 inch, breadth of do. -10 inch.; 

 apical angle corvex, divergence 38. 



From the same locality and position we have a single specimen agreeing in 

 ail respects with the above, excepting that the volutions are much flatter and 

 the suture less distinct. This may be another species, but without seeing more 

 specimens we are unable to satisfy ourselves it is not a variety of the same. 



Locality. Fort Clark. 



Bulimus Nebrascensis. 



Shell ovate ; spire rather short, conical, obtuse at the apex ; volutions fonr 

 and a half, convex ; suture distinctly impressed ; surface polished and marked 

 with nearly obsolete lines of growth ; outer lip apparently sharp ; inner lip very 

 thin above, thicker and slightly reflexed below ; aperture narrow ovate, acutelj' 

 angular above, somewhat narrowly rounded below. Length -27 inch ; breadth 

 -13 inch; length of aperture -15 inch, breadth of do. -07 inch; apical angle cob- 

 vex, divergence 47. 



It is possible this may be only a variety of the last, which it resembles in many 

 respects. It differs, however, in being a relatively thinner shell, has one whorJ 

 less, the spire is comparatively shorter, and the apical angle is considerably 

 greater. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Pupa helicoides. 



Shell very small, oval or ovate; spire moierately elevated, apparently obtuse 

 at the point ; volutions five, convex, increasing gradually from the apex ; surface 

 marked with strong lines of growth, which cross the whorls obliquely ; suture 

 distinctly impressed ; aperture very oblique, subcircular, rounded on the lower 

 and outer sides, nearly straight next the body whorl ; lip slightly reflexed ; um- 

 bilicus quite small. Length -12 inch ; breadth -08 inch ; length of aperture -05 

 inch, breadth of do. .04 inch. 



So far as we have been able to see from examining distorted specimens of 

 this species, it is without teeth. In this, as well as in many other respects, it 

 appears to have been very much like the recent /*. simplex (Gould,) but is about 




1856.] 110 



three times as large, aud differs in baviag stronger and more elevated linea of 

 growth. It may be an elevated Helix. 

 Loc dity. Three miles above Fort Union. 



LlMN^A TENUICOSTA. 



Shell small, turrited, very slender ; spire acutely elevated ; volutions four to 

 four and a half, vertically flattened, (or slightly convex,) increasing rapidly in 

 the direction of the longitudinal axis of the shell, and each so much smaller 

 than the succeeding one below it, as to form a shoulder or offset at the suture ; 

 surface ornamented by sharply elevated, equidistant, linear folds parallel to the 

 minute lines of growth ; suture very oblique, rather strongly impressed ; aper- 

 ture unkiown. Length -29 inch; breadth -08 inch ; apical angle regular, di- 

 vergence about 26. 



This exceedingly slender, delicate little Limnea, is not apt to be confounded 

 with any other fossil or recent species with which we are acquainted. Its at- 

 tenuated form, vertically flattened whorls, and peculiar linear folds, are charac- 

 ters by which it will be easily identified. None of our specimens show the 

 aperture, though it must be narrow, and a little shorter than the spire. It is ii 

 very rare shell. 



Locality. Three miles below Fort Union. 



PhYSA liONGIUSCULA. 



Shell elongate ovate ; spire slender, rather elevated, acute at the apex; whorls 

 about six, flattened or slightly convex ; suture not very distinct ; surface marked 

 with fine, straight, nearly obsolete lines of growth, which cross the whorls at 

 right angles to the suture ; aperture apparently narrow ; outer lip meeting the 

 body whorl at an acute angle above. Length -59 inch ; breadth -27 inch ; apical 

 angle regular, divergence 43. 



Our specimens are too imperfect to show the exact form of the aperture, 

 though it appears to have been narrow, very acutely angular above, and nar- 

 rowly rounded below. The lines of growth are faint, and the substauce of tiie 

 shell thin. This species quite closely resembles some varieties of P. hypnorun 

 (Lin.,) but the body volution is relatively wider, the spire somewhat less ele- 

 vated, and the aperture narrower. 



Locality. Three miles above Fort Union. 



Physa rhomboidea. 



Shell small, oval, narrowing abruptly from the middle towards both extremi- 

 ties ; spire rather short, conical, pointed ; volutions four and a half, slightly con- 

 vex, last one large, but scarcely ventricose ; surface marked with fine lines of 

 growth ; suture distinct ; aperture narrow, acutely angular above, narrowly 

 rounded below ; inner lip closely spread upon the body whorl above, and forrti- 

 ing a fold below the deeply impressed umbilical region. Length -26 inch ; 

 breadth -10 inch ; length of aperture -15 inch, breadth of do. -07 inch ; apical 

 angle nearly regular, divergence 57"' 



The smaller size, less elongated form and shorter spire, will serve to distiii- 

 guish this species from the last. From the same bed we have a few other specv 

 mens, which have a relatively wider and more oblique aperture, and a more 

 ventricose body whorl, but they are so nearly identical in other respects with 

 this, that we can only regard them as a variety of the same. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Physa Nebrascensis. 



Shell large, ovate, thin ; spire rather short; whorls about five, flattened or 

 slightly convex ; suture very oblique, not strongly impressed ; surface marked 

 with coarse lines of growth ; aperture narrow, acutely angular above, narrowly 

 rounded below ; columella impressed in the umbilical region, and having a kimd 




120 [June, 



of fold at its junction with the outer lip below. Length about 1 inch ; breadth 

 57 inch; length of aperture -55 inch, breadth of do. -26 inch. 



It is probable the above description will have to be modified somewhat, when 

 perfect specimens are obtained, as all those we have seen are more or less 

 broken. 



Locality. Three miles below Fort Union. 



Physa subelongata. 



Shell elongate ovate ; spire elevated, acute at the apex ; volutions about six 

 and a half, nearly flat ; suture oblique, linear, scarcely distinct ; surface faintly 

 marked with lines of growth; aperture unknown; columella twisted into a kind 

 of fold below the impressed umbilical region. Length 1-16 inches ; breadth -53 

 inch ; length of aperture about -57 inch ; apical angle very convex, divergence 

 49''. 



This Physa belongs to the same type as two or three elongated species de- 

 scribed by Matheron, from the Great Lignite formations of the south of France, 

 (^Catalogue Methodique, &c., pi. 36.) It differs, however, from his P. Gardanennis, 

 which it most neirly resembles, in having much flatter volutions, a le-s dis- 

 tinctly impressed suture, and relatively smaller body whorl. Our specimen is 

 so much broken and worn, that if there were other markings than those pre- 

 served they would have been obliterated. 



Locality. Bad Lands of the Judith. 



Planorbis subumbilicatus. 



Shell very small, subdiscoidal ; spire flat ; volutions two and a half to three, 

 nearly cyliudrical ; surface marked with very fine, rather indistinct lines of 

 growth ; sutures strongly defined ; umbilicus large, showing the volutions to the 

 apex ; aperture round or obliquely a little oval. Larger diameter -IS inch ; 

 smaller do. -14 inch. 



Locality. Three miles below Fort Union. 



Planorbis convolutus. 



Shell large, discoidal, nearly equally concave, and exhibiting all the whorls on 

 both sides ; volutions slightly embracing, very strongly separated by the sutures, 

 more broadly rounded on the right than on the left side ; surface (of cast) 

 having faint undulations parallel to the obsolete lines of growth, which pass 

 round very obliquely forward from the right to the left ; aperture ovate, nar- 

 rower on the left than the right side, slightly concave within, for the reception 

 of the succeeding whorl ; right lip projecting considerably beyond the left. 

 Greater diameter 1.01 inch ; smaller do. .32 inch. 



In its general appearance this species approaches P. rotundatus of Brong., but 

 is much less compressed. It differs also in the form of the aperture, which is 

 wider than high, while that of P. rotundatus is higher than wide (See Deshays' 

 Coq. foss. pi. 9, fig. 7 and 8.) 



Locality. Little Horn river. 



Velletia (Ancylus) minuta. 



Shell minute, ovate or elliptical-pattiform, exceedingly thin and fragile; ex- 

 tremities rounded ; anterior end apparently a little wider than the posterior ; 

 apex moderately elevated, obtuse, nearer the posterior end than the middle, 

 turned to the left ; front slope convex ; posterior and postero-sinistral slopes 

 concave, dextral convex ; surface marked with fine concentric striic. Length 

 .08 inch ; breadth .06 inch ; height .03 inch. 



Resembles Velletia elegaiis of Edwards, {Ancylus elegans of Sowerby, Min. Conch, 

 pi. 533) but is much smaller, and wants the radiating striae of that species. 



Locality. Three miles below Fort Union. 



Paludina mcltilineata. 

 Shell conical-ovate, rather thin ; spire elevated ; volutions six to six and a 

 half, rounded convex, increasing gradually from the apex ; suture strongly im- 




1856.] / 121 



pressed ; surface ornamented by more or less distinct lines of growtli, which are 

 crossed by numerous small, thread-like, revolving lines ; aperture comparatively 

 small, obliquely-ovate ; inner lip thin and reflexed below so as to partly cover 

 the small umbilical perforation. Length 1 inch ; breadth .71 inch ; length of 

 aperture .47 inch ; apical angle convex, divergence 54 to 60. 



Sometimes the lower volution, which generally forms less than half the entire 

 length of the shell, is slightly flattened above the middle, so as to leave an ob- 

 scure angle a little below the suture. On the upper half of the volutions the 

 revolving lines are separated by spaces from two to five times their width, but 

 decrease in size and become closely crowded on the lower part of the last whorl, 

 excepting near the umbilicus, where they are again stronger, more distant, and 

 minutely flexuous. On worn specimens the revolving lines are often obscure. 



Locality. Fort Clark. 



Paludina vetula. 



Shell conical-ovate, not very thick ; spire relatively small, moderately elevated; 

 volutions about five and a half, convex, narrow, increasing gradually from the 

 apex, last one large and ventricose ; surface marked with fine lines of growth, 

 which are crossed by obscure revolving lines ; suture strongly impressed, very 

 slightly oblique ; aperture narrow ovate ; umbilical perforation closed or \cvj 

 small. Length about .81 inch ; breadth .60 inch ; length of aperture .40 inch ; 

 breadth of do. .24 inch ; apical angle nearly regular, divergence 60. 



Associated with this species a few specimens about one third larger were found, 

 which have a more elevated spire, in consequence of which the divergence of 

 the apical angle is some four or five degrees less. The revolving lines also ap- 

 pear stronger. It is very difficult to determine, without a larger number of in- 

 dividuals in a better state of preservation, whether they are a variety of this 

 species or whether they may not be identical with the last. It is even possible a 

 more extensive collection may prove both these to be only varieties of the last, 

 though as we now see them, they present quite a different aspect, especially the 

 smaller variety, which has a more slender and much less elevated spire, with 

 more depressed whorls, smaller umbilical perforation, and much less distinct re- 

 volving lines. The body whorl is also relatively larger and much more extended 

 below. 



Locality. Bad Lands of the Judith. 



Paludina Leai. 



Shell conical-ovate, oblique ; spire not much elevated, pointed at the apex , 

 volutions five and a half to six, convex, sometimes ventricose, last one obscurely 

 angular below the middle ; suture well defined ; surface marked with fine lines 

 of growth, which are crossed by extremely fine, nearly obsolete revolving striae, 

 and at regular intervals by revolving rows of minute, shallow punctffi ; aperture 

 broad ovate, obtusely angular above, rounded below ; outer lip thin ; inner lip 

 thin above, thicker and slightly reflexed below the small umbilical pit ; columella 

 deeply arcuate. Length .97 inch ; breadth .75 inch ; length of aperture .47 inch ; 

 breadth of do. .40 inch ; apical angle convex, divergence 65 to 80. 



This shell varies so greatly in the elevation of its spire, and the divergence of 

 its apical angle, that its varieties might be mistaken for three or four distinct 

 species. We have satisfied ourselves, however, by examining a large number of 

 specimens, that all these varieties are connected by a regular series of interme- 

 diate forms. In some individuals the upper volutions are slightly flattened on 

 top immediately below the suture, in others they are rounded convex, while in 

 a few instances all the whorls are more or less depressed, so as to give the shell 

 a subtrochiform aspect. Generally the fine revolving stria3 and rows of minute 

 punctae are nearly obsolete, and they are never visible without the aid of a good 

 lens. 



It is an interesting fact that this species is so nearly allied, both in form and 

 surface markings, to a Paludina now inhabiting the streams of Southern Asia, 

 {P. Bengalensis, of Lea) as to give rise to a doubt whether or not they really are 




122 [June, 



distinct. By comparison, however, with authentic specimens of the latter in the 

 cabinet of Dr. Lea, at Philadelphia, we find his species is generally larger and 

 slightly more elongated than ours, and the body volution more rounded and 

 I'iss extended below. 



We name this species after Dr. Isaac Lea,, the well known conchologist, who 

 first made known one of its nearest living representatives. 



Locality. Fort Union. 



Paludina retosa. 



Shell obli([uely obovate ; spire depressed conical, obtuse at the apex ; volutions 

 fjur and a half to five, convex, last one large, obliquely depressed above, and 

 obscurely angular below ; suture well defined ; surface marked with distinct 

 oblique lines of growth, and faint traces of extremely fine revolving striae; 

 aperture (broad ovate?) obtusely angular above, rounded below; pillar lip 

 thin above, thicker and closely folded back upon the deeply arcuate columella 

 below. Length .84 inch ; breadth .64 inch ; apicial angle very convex, diver- 

 gence about 90. 



It is barely possible this may be one of the extreme varieties of the last ; it 

 differs however from any of the forms we have considered referable to that 

 species, in having a much less elevated and more obtuse spire. The lines of 

 growth also pass round the volutions much more obliquely, and the body volu- 

 tion is relatively larger. None of our specimens have the aperture entire. 



Locality. Three miles below Fort Union. 



Paludina Consadi. 



Shell elongate-trochiform, thick ; spire raher elevated, acute at the apex; 

 volu'ions apparently about six, flai, last one more or less angular below the 

 middle, and obliquely extended below ; surface marked with fine lines of growth, 

 crossed by delicate, nearly obsolete, revolving lines ; suture linear ; sperture sub- 

 circular, or broad ovate, obtusely angular above, (broadly rounded below?); 

 columella profoundly depressed in the umbilical region ; umbilicus none. Lergth 

 about 1 inch ; breadth -70 inch ; length of aperture -44 inch ; apical angle slight- 

 ly convex, divergence 54. 



In young specimens the angle on the lower part of the body whorl is quite dis- 

 tinct, and modifies the form of the aperture, but is more obscure in older shells. 

 Like P. Leui (of this paper), this species also has its near living representntives 

 amongst .Asiatic species, of which . Fra"cif>ci (Turbo Francisci of Wood,) is aa 

 example. We nume it in honor of Mr. T. A. Conrad, of Trenton New Jersey. 



Locality. Bad Lands of the Judith. 



Paludina peculiaris. 



Shell trochiform, rather thin, oblique ; spire conical, acute at apex; volutions 

 (five and a halt?) flattened convex, last one distinctly angular a little below the 

 middle ; surface marked with fine, rather indistinct lines of growth, crossed by 

 neaily obsolete, exceedingly fine revolving striae; suture moderatelj dtfined ; 

 aperture round ovate, or sub-quadrate. 



Our specimens of this species arc imperfect at both extremities ; some of them 

 have a breadth of 53 inch, and indicate a length of about -f inch The apical 

 angle of a specimen consisting of the lower two whorls is 47; but as it waa 

 probably greater near the apex, the mean may have been as great as 50. In 

 form and general appearance it is very much like the last, and may possibly 

 prove to be onl, a variety ot that species; it is, however, a thinner shell, and the 

 voluii'ms are more convex. 



Locality. Fort Claik. 



Paludina trochiformis. 



Shell trochiform, thin ; spire conical, pointed at the apex ; volutions five and a 

 half to i-ix, nearly flat, and ornamented by two slightly elevated revolving ririges; 

 last whorl strongly angular below the middle ; surface marked with ver\ fine lines 

 of growth, and exceedingly slender, raised, revolving lines ; suture linear, scarce- 




1856.] 123 



If distinct ; aperture sub-quadrate, or rounded ovate, more angular above, broad- 

 ly rounded below ; lip thin, reflexed on the colutnf-llar side below, but leaving a 

 small umbilical groove; columella strongly arcuate. Length -S*] inch; breadth 

 73 inch ; apical angle convex, divergence 73 to 77. ^ 



This interesting shell is so unlike the usual forms of PalUdina, that we would 

 have referred it to that genus with much doubt, had it not been for the fact that 

 we have from the same bed some intermediate gradations between it and the 

 risual typical forms of the genus. One of these, P. Leidyi of ih'S paper must be 

 (judging from the upper volutions,) in its young state, almost exactly like this, 

 both in form and surlace markings, yet at maturity, its last volution loses 

 almost entirely the angular outline characterizing this species at all stages of its 

 growth. We have seen fragments of this species indicating a size at least three 

 times as great as that of the specimen from which the above measurements were 

 taken. 



P. cingulata of Matheron (see Catalogue Methodique, &c., p. 223,) from the 

 Lignite formations near the mouth of the Rhone, resembles this more than any 

 fossil species with which we are acquainted, but ditFersin the surface markings. 

 Amongst recent species it has two or three closely allied representatives, now in- 

 Ijahitingthe rivers of China and Siam, of which P. pyrimidata (Phillippi) is an 

 exam [lie. 



LoculHy. Ten miles below Fort Union. 



Palt'dina Leidyi. 



Shell very large, conical-ovate, oblique, thin ; spire elevated ; upper volutiona 

 flattened, and ornamented by two indistinct revolving ridges ; lower ones more 

 rounded, last rather ventri-ose, and obscurely angular below ; suture linear and 

 scarcely distinct above, but well defined between the lower whorls ; surface 

 marke(l with distinct lines of growth, crossed by very fine, elevated revolving 

 lines, generally obsolete on the lower volutions; aperture apparently ovate; in- 

 ner lip spread upon the body whorl, but leaving partly uncovered a small, d(!ep, 

 oblique umbilical pit. Length about 1 86 inches; breadth 1-32 inches; apical 

 angle convex, divergence 65. 



The most remarkable ftatures about this fine Paludina, are is large size, and 

 the peculi'irity of having the lower volutions smoothly rounded, or more or less 

 convex, while those nearest the apex are flattened and ornamented by two ob- 

 scure revolving ridges. The angle on the lower part of the last whorl is very- 

 obscure near the aperture, but becomis more distinct higher up, and must be 

 quite conspicuous on young shells. Unfortunately we have no specimens with 

 the aperture entire. (Jnr best specimen consists of four volutions, and judging 

 from the appearance of the broken apex, it must have had about two more. 



We name this species after Prof Joseph Leidy, of the University of Pennsyl- 

 vania. 



Localiiij. Ten miles below Fort Union. 



Valvata parvula. 



Shell very small, much depressed or subdiscoidal ; spire rising little above 

 the body whorl ^ volutions about three, nearly cylindrical, and having near the 

 middle, on the upper and lower sides, a distinct linear carina ; surface marked 

 with strong regular lines of growth ; sutures distinct ; umbilicus wide and deep, 

 showing all the volutions to the apex, aperture round or transversely oval. 

 Height .05 inch ; breadth .10 inch. 



Frnm V. tricarinata (Say,) some varieties of which this resembles more than 

 any spec es known to us, it differs in having a wider umbilicus, less elevated 

 spire, and much stronger lines of growth. 



Localvy. Three miles below Fort Union. 



Melania minutdla.

 increasine gradually from the apex and flattened obliquely outwsrd fiom above, 

 near two-thirds of the way down, whence they round abruptly in to the suture

 surface faintly marked with fine lines of growth ; aperture ovate or sub-rhom- 

 boidal, angular above, widest near the middle, very narrowly rounded and ob- 

 scurely sinuate on the inner side below; columella somewhat less arcuate than 

 the outer side of the aperture ; lip thin and slightly refiexed at its junction with 

 the lower part of the columella. Length -16 inch ; breadth -05 inch ; length of 

 aperture -04 inch, breadth do. -03 inch ; apical angle regular, divergence 20" to 



This beautiful little Melania approaches very near in size as well as in form, 

 M. spina, a Miocene species described by M. Grataloup {Conch. Melan. 10, t. 5, 

 fig. 6 and 7,) but differs in having fewer and more convex volutions. 



Locality. Three miles below Fort Union. 



Melania Anthonyi. 



Shell very small, conical-ovate ; spire not much elevated ; volutions five to five 

 and a half, slightly convex, increasing somewhat rapidly from the apex, last one 

 rather large and obtusely angular below; surface marked witb fine, indistinct 

 lines of growth, crossed by extremely fine, nearly obsolete, revolving striae ; suture 

 well defitied; aperture ovate, angular above, widest a little telow the middle, 

 narrowly rounded and very faintly sinuate on the inner side below; lip thin, 

 elighily reflexed on the lower and inner side, but leaving open a small umbilical 

 perf )ration ; columella regularly arcuate. Length -18 inch ; breadth -10 inch ; 

 length of aperture -OG inch; breadth of do. -01 inch ; apical angle slightly convex, 

 div. rgence 41. 



Without a very careful examination with a good lens, in a favorable light, (he 

 extremely fine revolving strias on this neat little shell would be overlooked. In 

 form it is almost an exact miniature of M. Xebrascensis of this paper, but a care- 

 ful comparison with the young of that species of its own size, shows it to be quite 

 different. In addition to this, it occurs in great abundance at localities where 

 no authentic specimens of that species were met with. We have no doubt of 

 its being an adult shell. We name it after Mr. John G. Anthony, of Cincinnati, 

 Ohio, to whom we are under obligations for suggestions in regard to it and two 

 or three other species described in this paper. 



Licaliiy. Yellow stone river, thirty miles above the mouth. 



Melania mcltistriata. 



Shell small, elongate-ovate ; spire conical, somewhat elevated, acute at the 

 apex ; volutions five and a half to six, convex ; surface marked with fine indis- 

 tinct lines of growth, and exceedingly fine, closely arranged revolving striae ; 

 suture well defined ; aperture narrow-oval, or ovate, contracted, but scarcely 

 sinuous below; columella regularly curved. Length -23 inch ; breadth 12 inch ; 

 length of aperture -10 inch ; breadth of do. -06 inch ; apical angle regular, diver- 

 gence 39. 



This may be distinguished from the last by its more elevated spire, and more 

 elongated body whorl, which is never angular below. The aperture is also 

 narrower, and the columella imperforate. From the young of M. Nebr^iscensis 

 of its own size, it differs in bemg more elongated, and in having one or two more 

 whorls. The revolving striae are also more uniform, and so very fine as to be 

 only visible by the aid of a strong mHgnifier. 



Locality. Ten miles above Fort Union. 



Melania Nebbascensis. 

 Shell elongate-ovate ; spire conical, not very much elevated, acute at the apex ; 

 volutions about six, flattened convex; surface marked by fine lines of growth, 

 crossed by numerous more or les^ elevated revolving lines, some of which, on the 

 middle of the whorls, are sometimes so much larger than the others as to form 

 distinct carinas; suture strongly impressed; aperture ovte, angular above, 

 narrowly rounded and very faintly sinuous below ; outer lip prominent below the 

 middle ; columella regularly curved. Length -78 inch ; breadth -42 inch ; length 




1856.] 125 



of aperture -37 inch; breadth of do. -21 inch; apical angle convex or nearly 

 regular, dlvprgence (variable) 44. 



This sppcies presents numerous varieties of forna, apparently dependent upon 

 age. In younger individuals the spire is relatively less elevated, the whorls more 

 rounded and the aperture larger and more oblique. In its surface njHrkitigs it 

 also varies greatly, even in specimens of the same size. The carinoe formed by 

 the laiger revolving lines being in some specimens quite distinct, while in others 

 they are scarcely larger than the finer revolving lines which may be seen by the 

 aid of a lens to form, with the lines of growth, a delicate sub-cancellate surface 

 on all parts of the shell. On other specimens, all these surface markings are 

 almost euiirely wanting. 



Locality. Ten miles above Fort Union. 



Melania convexa. 



Shell rather large, much elongated, sub-cylindrical or terete ; volutions (about 

 ten?) fi'it, closely wouud, and increasing very gradually from the apex; surface 

 ornamented by fine lines of growth, ciossed by distinct, regular, thread-like, re- 

 volving: lines, and extremely fine, nearly obsolete revolving striae ; suture general- 

 ly indistincr; aperture apparently ovate ; lip thin, having a broad very shallow 

 sinus helow \h^. suture, and another near the base of the columella. Length 

 about 1-60 inches ; breadth -48 inch; length of aperture -45 inch ; apical angle 

 convex, divergence 21. 



Our b^st specimen of this interesting species consists of seven volutions, and 

 appears to have lost two or three others from the apex ; the aperture is also dis- 

 torted. Tbe larger revolving lines, about seven of which may be counted on 

 the .second volution, are quite distinct, and near one-third as wide as tbe spaces 

 between, while the liner revolving strias are closely crowded, and so small as to 

 be only seen by the aid of a good lens. The divergence of the apical angle, be- 

 low the middle of an adult shell, is noc more than 13", while above, (and in 

 yout)g shells,) it is as mufh as 28 to 30. 



In tlie last number of tbe Proceedings of the Academy, we described a shell 

 resembling this very closely in form, from the Yellow Sione river, where it was 

 found associated, in a loose mass, with fragments of an Ostrea and a small Cre- 

 taceaus species of Oardnim, (C. rarum, Evans and Shumard). Our specimens 

 being worn and imperfect, we supposed, from its associates, it must be a marine 

 shell, and referred it to tbe genus Turrilella, under the name of T. convex i We 

 now think it may possibly be a specimen of this species, from the junction of tbe 

 Cretaceous and Tertiary beds. 



Locality. Bad Lands of the Judith. 



Cerithium Nebrascensis. 



Shell elongate-conical, very slender, whorls (nine?) convex, and ornamented 

 by three revolving rows of sharply elevated granules, placed upon obscure 

 vertical folds; surface marked with very fine lines of growth, crossed by much 

 stronger, elevated, thread-like, revolving lines, two, three, or more ot which 

 may be counted between each row of granules, suture distinct; aperture ap- 

 parently nearly circular, but teiminating below on the inner side, in a small 

 notch. Length about 1 inch ; breadth -29 inch ; apical angle regular, diver- 

 gence 19. 



On the lower part of the body whorl there are three or four small revolving 

 lines, two of the upper of which are sometimes granular, making on this whorl 

 five rows of granules. Between these and the next row above, one of the revolv- 

 ing liiif^s is also minutely granular. Inform and general appearance, this re- 

 semhl it: two or three species described by Deshays, from tbe Paris basm, but on 

 close cmnparison, we find it quite distinct from them all. Amongst existing 

 species, it appears to be nearest C. granulosum, and estuary species from the 

 Western coast of Africa. 



Locality. Near head waters of Little Missouri.

Correction. 



In a paper communicated by us to the Academy in March last, and published 

 in the preceding number of the Proceedings, we referred to the genus Pyrula 

 a shell (P. Z?a!rf/f, page 66), which we have since satisfied ourselves belongs 

 more correctly to the genus Busycon of Bolten ;. we now change the name to 

 Bmycon Bairdi. 



Ceratites Americanus. 

 By Professor L. Harper, University of Mississippi. 



The Ceratites, a Cephalopodus mollusk, subgenus of Ammonites, has been 

 discovered in Europe long ago. All the European species, without any excep- 

 tion, belong to the new red sandstone or Triassic formation. Twenty-one species 

 have, according to Bronn, been placed in the St. Cassian formation in Tyrol, to 

 which the lowest place in the Trias has most probably to b^i assigned. One 

 species is found in the St. Cassian rocks and also in the Muschelkalk ; one in 

 the Bunter sandstein and the Muschelkalk, and of the remaining eight species, 

 three belong certainly and five probably to the Muschelkalk of the Trias. The 

 Cerrttiips were therefore considered as characteristic, and belonging exclusi^-ely 

 to the nciv red sandstone formation, and exclusively a European fossil, until a 

 few years ago L. V. Bach, the late great German Geologist, discovered a Cera- 

 tites in the cretaceous rocks of the Caucassus, which he called Ceratites Syriacus. 

 No species of the Ceratites has heretofore been found on the continent of Ame- 

 rica. 



About three years ago, in summer, 1853, when I was in the State of Alabama, 

 I examined the bed of the Tuscaloosa or Black Warrior River, near the little 

 village of Erie in Greene County, about 12 miles above the confluence of the 

 Tombigbee and Black Warrior rivers, between the 32d and 33d degrees of north 

 latitude, where the river cuts through the lowest part of the cretaceous forma- 

 tion of our southern State^", corresponding most probably to the Turonien ot 

 D'Orhigny. The bluff of the river consists here entirely of different strata of 

 green sand, divided in several parts by thin seams of a hard co' glomerate of 

 peroxide of iron and green sand, and is from 50 to 95 feet high. The river was 

 then unusually low, and more than one-half of its bed perfectly dry and acces- 

 sible. 



On a sand-bank in the middle of the river, immediately below a very deep 

 place, were found, among other evidently cretaceous fossils, three specimens of 

 a smalJ Ammonite, which, after a careful examination, I immediately recognized 

 to be a species of Ceratites, in which opinion I was later confirmed by as high 

 an authority as Prof. L. Agassiz, of Cambridge, who pronounced it to be a new 

 species of Ceratites, closely allied to Ceraticus Syriacus of L. V. Btich. 



This bfiog the first Ceratites ever found on the continent of America, I pro- 

 pose for it the name of 



Ceratites americanus.

much water-wore. They are both flat and discoid, No. 2 more so than No. 1 ; 

 both taper very much towards the apex, and increase especially rapidly from 

 the middle towards the aperture. Both consist of at must two whorls, the 

 dorsal part of the second being more than half overlapped by the ventral part of 

 the first, and lying, as it were, in a groove. They have ap[)arently six lobes and 

 as many saddles, the lobes being provided with three teeth, which, on account 

 cf their size, might rather be called sscondary lobes. The septa are angular 

 and bent backwards on the back. The siphuncle is dorsal, as seen on fig. A, 

 where it is broken out and has left a groove. In No. 1 the latter half of the 

 second whorl is broken out and a hole is left. The size of both specimens is 

 very nearly the same. No. I measures in length 58-3 millimetres, in width 50- s., 

 and in thickness 31. No. 2 measures in length 51- s. millimitres, in width 46, 

 and in thickness 26. 



No. 2. 



No. 1. 



I was first inclined to recognize in the three ppecimens two different species, 

 hut the somewhat different appearance seems to have been caused by the attri- 

 tion which they have undergone. 



The question arises here, from which formation these Ceratites come ? The 

 circumsrances that they have been found in the lower cretaceous formation, that 

 carbonate of lime is the fossillizer, and that they are closely allied to Ceratites 

 Syriacus of the cretaceous formation of Asia Minor, are indeed strong reasons 

 to pronounce them to be cretaceous fossils, but this seems to me still somewhat 

 doubtful. 




128 [June, 



When I first saw them, I was not aware that Ceratites had ever been found in 

 any other but in the Triassic formation, and the discovery astonished me in a 

 high degree. I was indeed induced to believe that they indicated the presence 

 of the Trias somewhere not very far from the place where they were found, until 

 I saw that L. V. Buch found Ceratites in the cretaceous rocks. 



It is true the specimeos alluded to were found on a sand-bank in the Black 

 Warrior River, where it cuts through the lowest part of the cretaceous formation 

 of our southern States, just below a very deep place of the river ; but are they 

 not marked out of a formation underlying the upper secondary and reactied by 

 the water of the river in that deep place ? If these Ceratites were a fossil belong- 

 ing to the cretaceous formation, even to the very lowest part of it, specimens of 

 them must and would have been found before and after my finding them. There 

 are a great many places in Alabama, as well as in Mississippi and Tennessee, 

 where the lower part of the cretaceous rocks crops out, where it is cut through 

 by rivers and gullies, and where it has often and carefully been examined and 

 searched for fossils, but never, neither before nor afterwards, have specimens of 

 Ceratites been found. 



I have myself carefully examined a good many such outcrops in Alabama, 

 even the one where the Ceratites were found ; as State Geologist of Mississippi, 

 and for more than two years engaged in the geological survey of this State, 1 

 have examined very nearly all the outcrops of the lower cretaceous formation, 

 which is here still better developed than in Alabama ; I have made it a particular 

 point to search carefully for Ceratites, but never again have I succeeded to find 

 another specimen of the Ceratites; nor have I ever heard that any one of the 

 many amateurs that collect fossils has ever seen or found one. 



That the above described specimens of Ceratites have been washed out of a 

 formation underlying the cretaceous rocks in Alabama, seems to me the more 

 probable, first, as there is in that State between the carboniferous and creta- 

 ceous formation an area occupied by an intermediate, undetermined formation, 

 extending from Autuga County through parts of Bibb, Tuscaloosa and Pi> kens 

 to Fayette County, which has been laid down in the geological chart of thai 

 State of 1849 (by a typographical error, as I understand,) as iertiari/. hat -which, 

 although in many places covered by drifted tertiary sands and clay, is by no 

 means tertiary. It goes under the lower cretaceous rocks and is overlapped by 

 them, is clearly visible, not only in the northern part of the town of Eutaw, but 

 also at Finch's Ferry, on the Black Warrior, in Greene County. What forma- 

 tion this is seems difiicult to decide, it being devoid of fossils. It must, of course, 

 be one of the older formations, intermediate between the coal and the lime, and 

 I should not at all be astonished if a careful examination should give the resul: 

 of its classification among the Poikilitic rocks, to which its variegated clay bears 

 indeed great resemblance. Another reason which renders it more probable that 

 the Ceratites have been worked out of a formation wnderlying the cretaceous 

 formation, is that nearly all the Artesian wells in Greene County, in Alabama, 

 contain a great deal of chloride of sodium and give really salt water. It is not 

 very probable that this chloride of sodium, very seldom, if ever, comes from the 

 salt-bearing cretaceous formation. 



Examination of the Meteoric Iron from Jiiquipilco, Mexico^ 

 By W. J. Taylor. 



The meteoric iron from Xiquipilco, Mexico, appears to have been first men- 

 tioned in the Gazeta de Mexico in 1'784. It is stated there that small pieces of 

 native iron, from a few ounces to fifty pounds in weight, were very numerous, 

 which were sought for by the Indians after heavy rains, who used them for 

 manufacturing agricultural implements. 



In a dissertation on metallic meteorites by Prof. W. S. Clark, the following 

 notices of its literature are given : Ann. des Mines t. 2, ser. 1, p. 337. Gazeta 

 de Mexico 178485, vol. i., pp. 146, 200. Klaproth Beitrage zur chemischen

In the examiuation made by M. Berthein he failed to detect the presence of 

 cobalt, but it is mentioned by Prof. Clark that Manross had found it in a speci- 

 men from the cabinet of Prof. Wohler ; my examination confirms in this respect 

 that of M. Manross. 



To the kindness of W. S. Vaux, Esq., I am indebted for the material for this 

 investigation ; Mr. Vaux has in his magnificent cabinet the principal portion of 

 a mass which weighed over ten pounds. It was originally about six inches 

 long, with an average diameter of three inches ; the lump was oblong with 

 rounded ends, the whole beiug covered with a thin crust of limonite. 



A cross section cut from this lump has been carefully polished and etched 

 by strong nitric acid, which gives a most beautiful surface of about three and a 

 half inches in length by two and a half in breadth, covered with the greatest 

 complexity of widmannstellian figures which almost defy description. 



The surface is crossed by bands about one-tenth to one-sixteenth of an inch 

 In breadth ; these apparent bands are cross sections of different planes, as i8 

 readily perceived by their different refractive powers. 



On changing the position of the specimen those that are a bright silvery- 

 white in one direction, become a dull gray in another, and vice versa. 



There are several systems of bands, which preserve a parallelism among 

 themselves and cross other systems at various angles, forming trapezoids, rhombs 

 and triangles. These several fields and their characteristic etchings will be 

 described in detail at some future time. Along the bands or planes thin lami- 

 nae of schreibersite have been observed, as in other meteoric irons. 



Imbedded in one side of the large lump (just described) was a globule of 

 pyrrhi'tine, which looks as if it had been dropped into the iron when it was in a 

 semi-fluid state. This globule appears to have been about an inch in diameter; 

 it was in part decomposed, but a small portion of the mineral was separated 

 sufficiently pure for the determination of its specific gravity and analyses. On 

 dissolving it in hydrochloric acid, thin laminae of schreibersite separated with 

 minute portions of chromic iron. 



Through the kindness of Dr. F. A. Genth, I have been permitted to make the 

 following analyses in his laboratory : 



Pyrrhotine dissolved in nitric acid, gave

 The remainder consisted principally of chromic iron, with a small portion of 

 schreibersite. 



The specific gravity was found to be 4-822. The ratio of sulphur to the metals 

 vas found to be

Nickel and Cobalt, 0-245 ) "''^"^ 

 It will be seen that the composition corresponds with that of pyrrhotine, con- 

 sidering its formula to be FeS, if we disregard the few impurities which were 

 found with it. 

 The meteoric iron was first treated in a flask with hydrochloric acid, and the 




130 [June, 



gas evolved wa3 passed through a solutioa of ammonia chloride of copper, but 

 not a trace of sulphur could be detected in this manner. 



Id the 5th supplement to Rammelsberg's Handworterbuch der Chemischen 

 Mineralogie, th's meteoric iron is mentioned as passive, experiments having been 

 made by Prof. Wohler ; but the piece belonging to Mr Vaux is evidently active, 

 throwing down metallic copper from a neutral solution of its sulphate. ThJf! 

 experiment was repeated with great care with confirmatory results. 



No. 1 was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and a slight precipitate was obtained 

 by hydrosulphuric acid, which, on a careful examiualioa before the blow-pipe, 

 was found to be copper with a trace of tin.

Contributions to the Ichthyology of the Western Coast of the United States, from 

 specimens in the museum of the Smithsonion Institution. 



By Charles Girard, M. D. 



Two years have scarcely elapsed since I communicated to the Academy de- 

 scriptions of various fishes collected upon different points of the Pacific coast of 

 North America. Dnring that period the indefatigable researches of several oifi- 

 ccs of the U. S. Army, and naturalists attached to the surveys made under 

 orders from the General Government, have brought to light nuxny new and in- 

 teresting members of that class of animals, and of which I propose now to give 

 a brief account, extracted from final Reports, made to the officers in charge of 

 these surveys. 



It has also been deemed advisable to mention such changes as have been made 

 in the generic position of several species previously described, either by me or 

 others, in order to give a more correct idea of the Reports just alluded to. 



It will be remembered that while I was engaged in those investigations of our 

 Western fishes, two naturalists, Drs. W. 0. Ayers and W. P. Gibbons, both resi- 

 dents of San Francisco, Cal., had (without any knowledge of what I was doing,) 

 described a certain number of species, some of which we already know have 

 proved identical with my own. The law of priority in their publication will 

 decide upon the names to be finally adopted in the nomenclature. So far I have 

 been unwilling to settle upon any identifications without the specimens to go by, 

 in order to avoid confusion as well as complicate the sj'nonymy. Drs. AyreK 

 and Gibbons, both, have shown an earnest desire to furnish me with authentic 

 specimens of the species which they have described, and I am happy to say that 

 from the former I have been favored by a good many up to this day, as will be 

 seen further on. 



For reference to the species described by Prof. Agassiz, some of which havf 

 appeared in my papers, it is but just to say that such identifications as were at- 

 tempted by me, were made from the accounts published at that time. As far a.s 

 genera are concerned I feel confident that no error was committed ; in regard to 

 the species I entertain certain doubts which can not be removed by the docu- 

 ments at our command. I have sought to do justice to the subject from the very 

 beginning, and rather than introduce any changes in their present nomencla- 

 ture I send them before the world as they now stand. 



With the above preliminaries I proceed into the subject. 



The species formerly described by me under the genus Lahrax were found, 

 upon further examination, to constitute a genus by itself, the relationship of 

 which being more those of Serranus than of Labrax, and it is in the vicinity of 

 the former that it ought to be placed in the ichthyic method. From Serranus 

 it may be distinguished by the outline of the spinous dorsal fin, and the rela- 

 tive development of the canine taeth, which are so small as to have suggested 

 the idea that the species belonged to Labrax. 



The new genus we will henceforth call 



FARALABRAX, 



and characterise as follow : " General physiognomy that of Labrax, but the first 

 dorsal fin is contiguous to the second as in Serranus. The profil of the body is 

 subfusiform the caudal fin subtruncated or slightly emarginated posteriorly. 




132 [June, 



The head is subconical, the lower jaw a little longer than the upper, the mouth 

 rather large ; card-like teeth upon the premaxillaries, dentaries, vomer and pala- 

 tines, with a row of small canine teeth along the edges of the jaws. Tongue 

 smooth. Small and homogenous spines upon the outer curve of the preopercle. 

 Two small and inconspicuous spines upon the margin of the opercle. Edge of 

 suborbital, entire ; humerus denticulated ; opercular apparatus and cheeks cover- 

 ed with scales, smaller on the cheeks than on the opercles. Gill openings con- 

 tinuous under the throat ; branchiostegal rays, six in number. Scales minutely 

 serrated posteriorly." 



Paralabrax nebulifer and P. clathratus 

 are the two species. 



Dr. Ayres's Centrarchus maculosus is my C. interruptus. 



A new and interesting member of the group TrachinidoB, we inscribe into the 

 method under the appellation of 



HOMALOPOMUS, 



" Thegeneral aspect of which is elongated, the mouth large, the lower jaw long- 

 est ; upper and lower jaws provided with canine teeth ; card-like teeth on the 

 vomer. Palatines toothless ; tongue smooth. Dorsal fins separated ; anterior, 

 small and subtriangular ; posterior, extending mostly to rest of space towards 

 the caudal. Anal fin longer than deep, situated far back. Opercular apparatus 

 spineless and scaly ; cheeks smooth and scaleless. Upper surface of head cover- 

 ed with minute scales. Scales covering the body of moderate development with 

 posterior margin entire, and smooth. Gill openings continuous under the head ; 

 branchiostegals, six in number." 



A single species is known, several specimens of which were examined, all of 

 which were collected at Astoria, Oregon Territory, by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, 

 U. S. A., to whom I take pleasure in dedicating it. 



HoMALOPOMUS TROWBRIDGII 



has the "snout pointed, the mouth deeply cleft, and the posterior extremity of the 

 raaxillaries extending to the vertical line of the posterior edge of the puj)il. The 

 eyes are large. The tips of the pectoral fins reach as far as the anterior margin 

 of the anal fin. The color is greyish brown above, and silvery grey beneath." 



In the Cottoid group there are glorious additions. In the first place I have 

 had the great satisfaction of identifying, from actual specimens, the Coitus asper of 

 Sir John Richardson, and to describe it comparatively with the other members 

 of the same genus. 



Amongst the truly marine representatives I will first introduce a type which 

 seems to bear much closer affinities to the fresh water genera than was anticipa- 

 ted. 



In naming it 



OLIGOCOTTUS, 



allusion is made chiefly to its diminutive size. We have full evidence that the 

 specimens before us are adults, and consequently have not hesitated in the se- 

 lection of that name. We are aware, however, that further search might bring 

 to notice other species not quite so small and still of the same generic stamp. 

 On the other hand, the etymology of a name is of but little avail towards eluci- 

 dating the history of the object it designates. The natural characters of the 

 genus will read as follows : "Head smooth, with the exception of a few spines 

 upon the preopercle and snout. Upper jaw slightly the longest. Teeth upon 

 the premaxillaries, dentaries, front of vomer and palatines. Gill openings 

 continuous under the throat ; branchiostegals six. Dorsal fins contiguous. 

 Caudal posteriorly rounded. Insertion of ventrals backwards the base of pec- 

 torals. Origin of anal fin in advance of the anterior margin of second dorsal. 

 Skin smooth, lateral line continuous for the whole length of the body." 




1856.] 188 



OlIGOCOTTUS MACCLOSnS. 



being the only species known at present, we will characterize it by saying : 

 " that the mouth is moderately cleft ; the posterior extremity of the maxillary 

 extending to a vertical line intersecting the pupil. A stoutish bicuspid processus 

 on the convexity of the preopercle. Two acute nasal spines. Anterior dorsal 

 lower than the second or posterior. Yellowish brown above, mottled or varie- 

 gated with blackish ; along the dorsal region a series of blotches of a deeper hue; 

 lower half of the sides vermiculated. Abdomen of a bright saffron or yellow 

 hue in the male. Inferior surface of head with traces of black markings ; throat 

 and abdomen unicolor, as also the ventrals and anal. Dorsals, caudal, and 

 pectorals transversally barred." 



It has been observed on several points of the coast between the bay of San 

 Francisco, Cal., to Puget Sound, W. T. In 1854, a few dried up specimens were 

 taken near Presidio by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, but their precarious state of 

 keeping did not permit us to classify them. The same was the case with those 

 collected at Fort Steilacoom by Dr. Geo. Suckley. It is but very recently that 

 well preserved specimens, collected by B. Samuels, in Tomales Bay, Cal., having 

 reached us, we have been prepared to determine their position in the ichthyic 

 method. 



The fish mentioned by Dr. Ayres under the name of Acanthocottusinermis jiroyes 

 to be my Leptocottus armatus. 



Next in order is another and entirely new genus, for which the name of 



LEIOCOTTUS, 



has been selected, more particularly in reference to its smooth aspect. Its char- 

 acters are : " head pei'fectly smooth : spines upon the preopercle only. Mouth 

 moderately cleft : jaws equal. Teeth upon the premaxillaries, dentaries and 

 front of the vomer ; none on the palatines. Barbules upon the maxillaries. 

 Gill openings continuous under the throat ; branchiostegal rays five. Dorsals 

 nearly contiguous upon their bases. Ventrals inserted backwards of the base 

 of tlie pectorals. Caudal posteriorly subtruncated. Skin perfectly smooth, 

 bearing neither prickles nor scales. Lateral line well marked and continuous 

 from head to tail." 



The species which has come under my observation has so much of the 

 aspect of Trigla that the specific name of 



Leiocottus hirundo 



suggested itself for it." The snout is declivous and rather pointed; the poste- 

 rior extremity of the maxillary is provided with two or three barbules and 

 reaches a vertical line drawn a little beyond the anterior rim of the orbit. Su- 

 perior regions blackish brown ; abdomen whitish beneath ; inferior part of tail 

 yellow." 



It was collected by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, U. S. A. at the island of San 

 Miguel, Cal. 



Dr. Ayres' Ilemitriptcrus marmoratus, is my Scorpj^nichthys marmoratus, 



Clypcocottus robustus of the same author, is my Aspicottus bison. 



The species described by me as Scorpcenichthys lateralis was subsequently re- 

 ferred by Dr. Ayres to a new genus of his under the denomination of Calycilepi- 

 dotus lateralLi, together with another species at that time unknown to me, under 

 the name of C. spi/iosus. On a former occasion Dr. Ayres had announced the 

 presence of two species of hemilepidoti in the Bay of San Francisco, for which 

 he proposed the names of II. nebulosus and H. spinosus. My Scorpcemchihys 

 lateralis was subsequently identified by himself to his If. nebulosus, and it was 

 then that the genus Calycilepidotus appeared with two species: C. spinosus and 

 C. lateralis. 



G. spinosus I have carefully examined, and I am satisfied that its proper place 

 is in the genus Ilemilepidotus, as characterised by Cuvier. In order, however, 

 to furnish reliable data to go upon, I must be permitted to offer a diagnosis of 

 of that genus as it now stands. 



10 




134 [June, 



Hemilepidotus. 

 '' Head rough and prickly, with membranous flaps on various parts; opercu- 

 lar apparatus spinous. Mouth moderately cleft; jaws equal. Teeth upon the 

 premaxillaries, dentaries, front of vomer and palatines. Gill openings sepa- 

 rated beneath by an isthmus ; branchiostegals, six on either side. Dorsal fins 

 contiguous. Caudal rounded posteriorly. Insertion of ventrals opposite the 

 base of pectorals. Longitudinal bands of scales alternating with nacked areas ; 

 scales themselves finely denticulated." 



Hemilepidotus spinosus 

 ' has membranous flaps on the upper surface and sides of the head. The eyes 

 are quite large. The posterior free extremity of the maxillary extends to a 

 vertical line drawn at the posterior rim of the pupil. Dorsal band of scales 

 composed of six rows or series ; lateral band of seven, five below and two above 

 the lateral line. Ground color dark reddish brown, with darker transverse bands 

 and blotches." 



Specimens labelled by Dr. Ayres were collected in the Bay of San Francisco, 

 Oal., by Dr. John S. Newberrv ; others in Humboldt Bav, by Lt. W. P. Trow- 

 bridge, U. S. A. " 



So much for Calycilepidotus spinosus : it is a true Hemilepidotus. 



As to C. lateralis, the second species of Dr. Ayres' genus, a careful study has 

 convinced me that it is not specifically identical with my Scorpcenichthys lateralis. 

 Subsequent investigations of more perfect si^ecimens have convinced me of the 

 propriety of removing the latter from the genus Scorpsenichthys, and since I had 

 uo specimens of Hemilepidotus nebulosus, Ayres, {Calycilepidotus lateralis, Ayres, 

 non mihi) by which to determine its generic affinities, I have been compelled to 

 institute, under the name of 



Artedius, 

 a new genus to receive two species, the one above referred to, and formerly de- 

 scribed by me as Scorpcenichlhys lateralis, and another which so far had remained 

 unnoticed. The following are its characters : " Head rough, with supra-orbital 

 membranous flaps. Spines upon the preopercle only. Mouth moderately cleft ; 

 lower jaw slightly overlapped by the upper. Teeth upon the premaxillaries, 

 dentaries, front of vomer, and palatines. Gill openings continuous under the 

 throat ; branchiostegals five on either side. Dorsal fins separated. Caudal sub- 

 truncated posteriorly. Insertion of ventrals opposite the base of the pectorals. 

 A dorsal band of pectinated scales." 



Artedius lateralis. 



Scorpcenichthys lateralis, Grd., has the " surface of the head smooth. Preopercle 

 armed with a flat bicuspid spine. Band of dorsal scales narrow, originating at 

 the thoracic arch and extending to near the terminus of the base of the second 

 dorsal. Anterior margin of first dorsal situated in advance of the thoracic arch. 

 Deep chesnut brown above, maculated with yellowish ; beneath yellowish." 



Specimens collected at San Luis Obispo, Cal.. by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, U. 

 S. A. 



Artedius notospilotus 

 is characterised by the " surface of the head being subtuberculous and scaly. 

 Preopercle armed with a flat tricuspid spine. Anterior margin of first dorsal 

 situated in advance of the beginning of the dorsal band of scales, which is broad 

 and extends from the thoracic arch to near the terminus of the base of the second 

 dorsal. Olivaceous, with a series of saddle-like black patches. Abdomen dull 

 yellow or white." 



Collected by E. Samuels in Tomales Bay, Cal. 



Sebastes ruber, Ayres, is my Sebastes rosaceus. 



Sebasies nebulosus, Ayres, is my Sebastes pasciatus. 



Sebastes variabilis, Ayres (not Cuvier) is my Sebastes auriculatus. 




1856.] 135 



Sebastes melanops, 



.1, 



is a species hitherto nudcscribed, and which we thus characterise : " Upper sur- 

 face of head generally spineless. Posterior extremity of maxillary reaching a 

 vcrticalline drawn interiorly to the posterior rim of the orbit. Origin of dorsal 

 fin opposite or else slightly in advance of the base of the pectorals. Upper re- 

 gions blackish brown ; sides brownish, spotted with black ; beneath greyish 

 brown." 



Specimens were collected at Cape Flattery, W. T., and at Astoria, 0. T.. bv 

 Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, U. S. A. 



A fine addition to the group of Heterolepids instituted in 1854 with two genera. 

 Chirus and Ophiodon, is the new genus 



OPLOPOMA, 



characterised by an " elongated body, membranous flaps above the orbits, and 

 spines on the preopercle. The snout is conical ; the mouth large, and the lower 

 jaw the longest. Canine teeth upon the premaxillaries, dentaries, front of vomer 

 aud the palatines. Gill openings continuous ; branchiostegals six on eitherside. 

 Dorsal fins contiguous. Caudal posteriorly subcrescentic or else concave. In- 

 sertion of ventrals a little posterior to the pectorals. Body covered by small 

 cycloid scales." 



Oplopoma pantheeina, 



the only species hitherto known, has the " upper surface and sides of the bead 

 granular. The preopercular spines are few, small and blunt. Posterior ex- 

 tremity of maxillary extending beyond the orbit. Origin of anterior dorsal 

 situated in advance of the convexity of the i^reopercle. Scales extending over 

 the base of both the caudal and pectoral fins. Blackish brown above, reddish 

 brown beneath. Dorsal and lateral regions spotted with black." 



Specimens of this species were collected by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, at Cape 

 Flattery, W. T. 



Gastbrosteus serratus, Ayres, I have investigated carefully, and found speci- 

 fically distinct from its congeners. 



I describe another speeies akin to it and G. plebeius. 



Gasterosteus inteemedius 



having the " body plated all over ; the peduncle of the tail keeled. Dorsal 

 spines three, moderate in development and inconspicuouslj- serrated upon their 

 edges ; anterior one inserted immediately behind the base of the pectorals. In- 

 sertion of ventrals irnder the second dorsal spine ; their own spine being serrated 

 upon both edges, more conspicuously above than below, and their extremities 

 not extending as far as the tips of the ossa innominata. Posterior margin of 

 caudal concave." 



Inhabits Cape Flattery, W. T., where it was collected by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, 

 U. S. A. 



Finally, under the name of 



Gasterosteus pugetti, 

 I introduce a new species in which the " body is only plated in part. Dorsal 

 spines three, slender, not serrated upon their edges ; anterior inserted immedi- 

 ately behind the base of pectorals. Insertion of ventrals in advance of the 

 second dorsal spine ; their own spine being slender, crenated upon its edges and 

 extending beyond the tips of the os.w innorainata. Posterior margin of caudal 

 slightly emarginated." 



Fort Steilacoom, Puget Sound, W. T. ; collected by Dr. Geo. Suckley, U. S. A. 



Leiostomus lineattts, Ayres, has come within my observation. The species is 

 characteristic. Specimens of it were brought home by Dr. J. S. Newberry. 



Leptogunellus gracilis, Ayres, I have likewise examined on specimens col- 

 lected by Dr. Newberry and labelled by Dr. Ayres. 




136 



[June, 



GOBIUS NEWBERRTI 



is a small and very gi-aceful species of Goby, hitherto undescribed. The average 

 size of many specimens observed is about two inches or less, the head forming 

 the fourth of the total length. The first dorsal is contiguous to the second at 

 its base, and is considerably lower than the latter. The mouth is deeply cleft, 

 the posterior extremity of the maxillary extending to a vertical line passing 

 posteriorly to the orbit. The origin of the anal is situated a little behind the 

 anterior margin of the second dorsal : both fins terminate evenly, as far as con- 

 cerns the tips of the posterior rays. The caudal forms the fifth of the total 

 length. The ground color is olivaceous, but the upper regions appear blackish 

 with isolated spots of the ground color ; the inferior regions are unicolor. 

 Atherina storeri, Ayres, is my Atherinopsis californiensis. 



Rhacocheilus toxotes, Agass., was identified on a specimen collected by E. 

 Samuels in Tomales Bay. 



Hysterocarpus traskii. Gibbons, could be recognized on a specimen collected 

 at Fort Reading by Drs. J. F. Hammond and John S. Newberry. Another speci- 

 men from the same locality had no irregular transverse bands of black, but was 

 almost unicolor. 



Another species of viviparous fish, 



Embiotoca argyrosoma, 

 is easily distinguished from its congener by the brilliant argentine tint of its 

 entire body, though made a little darker along the dorsal region by a greyish or 

 pinkish hue. The general form is elongated; the head rather small, subconical, 

 rounded anteriorly, and contained four times and a half in the total length. 

 The caudal is deeply forked. The posterior extremity of the anal extends a 

 little more posteriorly than the dorsal. The tips of the pectorals reach a ver- 

 tical line passing beyond the origin of the anal. Specimens were collected at 

 San Francisco, Cal., by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, U. S. A. 



Osmerus elongatus, Ayres, has been collected at San Francisco, Cal., by Dr. 

 John S. Newberry. The specimens were identified by Dr. Ayres. 



A most important (I was almost goingto say unexpected) discovery of a white 

 fish was made by the party on the R. R. Survey of California and Oregon, com- 

 manded by Lt. R. S. Williamson. And since it is different from its hitherto 

 known congener, we will call it 



COREGONUS WILLIAMSONI, 



as commemorative of that Survey. Its head is rather small, being contained 

 about five times in the total length, which measures eleven inches. The mouth 

 is very small and the posterior extremity of the maxillary does not extend as far 

 back as the anterior rim of the orbit. The scales are large ; eighteen rows of 

 them may be counted between the anterior margin of the dorsal and the inser- 

 tion of the ventrals : nine above the lateral line, and eight below it. The lateral 

 line, itself, is perfectly straight. The caudal fin forked as usual. The pectorals 

 are rather small. I have alluded to the color in saying it was a white fish ; add 

 to it a bluish grey hue along the back. It was collected by Dr. Newberry in 

 the Des Chutes river, a tributary of the Columbia. 



In adding a second species to the genus Platichthys, the diagnose of this 

 genus must be modified so as to read : " eyes on either the right or left side," 

 for 



Platichthys umbrosus, 

 which is the new species referred to, hag its eyes on the right, whilst in the 

 species formerly described, they are on the left. It can also readily be distin- 

 guished from its congener in having the body completely covered with scales, 

 on the surface of some of which prickles or asperities are observed. The speci- 

 men before us measures seven inches and a half, is of a uniform blackish brown 

 hue on the right side and light brown on the left. It was collected by Lt. W. 

 P. Trowbridge, U. S. A., at Cape Flattery, W. T. 




1856.] 137 



I have likewise a second species to add to my genus Pleuronichthys, taking 

 this opportunity of correcting a lapsus lingiice which occurred in the diagnosis of 

 its generic characters : " teeth very inconspicuous, occupying the colorless side 

 of the jaws," instead of both sides of the jaw. That this was a mere accident 

 will appear obvious by reading the characters given to Parophrys, in which an 

 allusion is made to the true state of things in Pleuronichthys. 



Pleuronichthys suttulatus, 

 appears to be a smaller species than its congener ; it is also deeper, less elon- 

 gated, hence more of a subcylindrical general form. The eyes are situated on the 

 right side. The origin of the dorsal fin is not quite even with the anterior 

 margin of the orbit, and in that respect the generic diagnosis will undergo a 

 slight modification. The largest specimens observed measure a little over three 

 inches. The ground color appears greyish black, over which are scattered light 

 spots ajipearing like as many drops irregularly dispersed. Specimens were col- 

 lected in Tomales Bay by E. Samuels. 



A specimen of Ophidium, in a too precarious state of preservation to be de- 

 termined specifically, was found by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, at S. Farallones, near 

 San Francisco. Another was collected by Dr. Suckley at Shoalwater Bay, W. 

 T., apparently of the same species. 



We have also to mention a Sandlaunee, under the name of 



Ammodytes personatus, 

 the general aspect of which is shorter than its congeners, although theform and 

 outline of the body are not materially different. We perceive no teeth on the 

 palat. The posterior extremity of the maxillary extends to a vertical line which 

 intersects the anterior rim of the orbit. The origin of the dorsal fin is situated 

 anteriorly to the tips of the pectorals. The base of the caudal fin is black. 

 Specimens were collected at Cape Flattery, W. T., by Lt. W. P. Trowbridsre. 

 U. S. A. 



Syngnathus californiensiSj Storer, 



was received from Monterey, Cal., through the care of A. S. Taylor. The 

 specimen is somewhat imperfect ; it is the largest of those which we have ex- 

 amined from the Pacific coast. 



AcciPBNSBR acutirosteis, Ayres, 



was brought home by Dr. Newberry, the specimen having been labelled by Dr. 

 Ayres in San Francisco, where the specimen was procured. 



AciPENSER MEDiROSTRis, Ayrcs, was received in the same manner as the pre- 

 ceding. 



AoiPENSER TRANSMONTANUS, Rich., from the Columbia river, has been collected 

 by Dr. Suckley. 



We conclude by referring to a ray of a remarkable genus, 



Rhinoptera vespertilio, 

 which was caught in Tomales Bay, by E. Samuels. The specimen before us 

 measures nineteen inches and a half from the extremity of the mouth to the 

 tip of the tail, six inches and three quarters being the length of the body and 

 head together. The width from the tip of one pectoral fin to the other is twelve 

 inches. There is a small dorsal fin situated upon the anterior portion of the 

 tail, followed by a flattened spear shaped spine, serrated upon its edge. The 

 tail is very attenuated, flagelliform, tapering into a filiform extremity. The 

 cephalic region is as long as the rest of the body. Its anterior outline is round- 

 ed. The eyes are very prominent and somewhat raised above the surface of 

 the head. The respiratory apertures, five in number are transversally elonga- 

 ted and arranged upon an open curve. The lips are fringed. The color is of 

 an uniform bluish slate above ; dull whitish beneath.

 tions to the Wilson Monument Fund, reported that he had received

ELECTION. 



Dr. Charles' S. Boker, Mr. John McAllister, Jr., and Dr. Samuel S. 

 Garrigues, all of Philadelphia, were elected Members. 



Dr. Morris* stated Ibat Alexis St. Martin, on whom Dr. Beaumont perforoiecl 

 his celebrated series of experiments, is now in town, and has been submitted 

 to some experiments at the Pennsylyania College by Dr. F. G. Smith, in the 

 presence of a few physicians. On Monday last, after breakfasting on bread and 

 butter and coffee, he partook at lOj, A. M., of beefsteak ; at the expiration of 

 two hours the fluid contents of the stomach were withdrawn by means of a 

 catheter. They had a decidedly acid reaction, but whether from chlorohydric 

 or lactic acid, I was unable to ascertain from the small cfuantity forwarded to 

 me for examination. The meat was rapidly being converted into chyme ; small 

 flocculi floated in the fluid and collected at the bottom, much paler than natural. 

 On being subjected to the microscope, the cellular tissue had nearly all disap- 

 peared, while the muscular fibres exhibited all stages of disintegration ; some 

 were found nearly of the usual color, some paler and with the transverse striae 

 beautifully marked. As the latter became less evident, longitudinal striation 

 exhibited itself, Avhile a minute punctation took the place of the transverse striae. 

 As the digestive process advanced, the whole fibril became granular, but the 

 longitudinal striation remained as long as there was any evidence of the struc- 

 ture. This goes to confirm the view of the minute anatomy of the muscles 

 maintained by Kolliker, in opposition to Todd and Bowman's disc theory. The 

 nuclei of the ruptured gastric cells, epithelium from the mouth, esopha- 

 gus and stomach, with numerous fat granules, completed the microscopic 

 appearances. This morning, at \()\ A. M., he partook of bread, and the fluid 

 being withdrawn as before at the end of two hours, presented the following ap- 

 pearances : The supernatant fluid resembled a starch solution, but on close 

 examination gave the faintest possible evidence of starch by the iodine test, 

 which I am disposed to regard as due mainly to the dextrine present. Trom- 

 mer's test gave abundant proof of the presence of the latter, or of grape sugar, 

 or both, and also indicated by the purplish hue of the liquid on the addition of 

 sulphate of copper and potassa to the fluid, the presence of a protein body. The 

 remnants of the bread, fully disintegrated, subsided to the bottom, and showed 

 abundant evidence of starch. So far as this experiment goes, it confirms the 

 views generally held as to the action of the saliva upon amylaceous bodies, in 

 contravention to those advanced by Lehmann, as to the active part played by 

 the intestinal fiuid (the secretion of the intestinal mucous membrane) in diges- 

 tion. The greater part of the bread had disappeared, giving place to grape 

 sugar, in consequence of the almost momentary action of the saliva, and leaving 

 mainly the function of absorption to be performed by the intestinal mucous 

 membrane.

[July, 



Mr. Ord transmitted a letter from Matthew Bsrr, dated Paisley, 21st 

 June, 1856, acknowledging the receipt of ^64 lis. 7d. as a contribu- 

 tion to the Wilson testimonial fund. 



Dr. Leidy stated, that in consequence of the unsatisfactory results of bis in- 

 vestigations, wliich had formed the subject of "A Memoir on the Extinct Dico- 

 tylinas of America,"* from the time of writing that memoir he had been col- 

 lecting material, both recent and fossil, towards a more positive determination 

 of the number of extinct species of Dicotylinae. The results of his subsequent 

 investigations appear to be as follows : 



1. The extent of variation in the characters of the skull, and especially of the 

 teeth, is as great in different individuals of the recent Dicoiyles torquaivs, as it 

 is in all the extinct genera and species heretofore indicated by Dr. Le Conte and 

 himself. 



2. The evidence, so far as it has been derived from osteological characters, 

 appears to refer all the extinct genera and species of North American Dicoty- 

 linse, as heretofore indicated, to one single species. 



The name of the latter and its synonyma are as follows : 



DicoTTLES coMPRESsus, Leidy. 



Syn. Platigonus compressus ; Hyops depressifrons ; Proiochoervs prismaiiciis ; Di- 

 eotyUs depressifrons ; Dicoiyles costatus, Le Conte. Euchoerus macrops, Leidy.

On a New Genus and Species of Urodela, from the collections of the U. S. Expl. 

 Exped., under Comm. Charles Wilkes^ U. S. N. 



By Charles Gieard, M. D. 



A species of this group was collected in Oregon by the U. S. Exploring Ex- 

 pedition, showing such a striking external resemblance with Aneides lugubris, that 

 upon a first examination we referred it to the latter genus. A closerexamination of 

 its structure made us acquainted with an ensemble of characters which has 

 induced us to establish a genus distinct from Aneides : by the shape of the mouth, 

 which is linear, instead of being undulating; by the maxillary teeth, which are 

 exceedingly minute, and the disposition of the vomero-palatine teeth, upon a 

 double ogee, instead of an obtuse angled triangle. 



HEREDIA. 

 Head subelliptical, broader than the body ; snout blunt and rounded, protru- 

 ding beyond the lower jaw. Cleft of the mouth oblique and rectilinear. Maxil- 

 lary teeth exceedingly minute, scarcely perceptible. Vomero-palatine teeth dis- 



Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. x., 323. 




1856.] 141 



posed upon a double ogee extending from the middle line of the palate along 

 the anterior inner edge of the orbit. Sphenoid teeth forming two elongated 

 patches. Tongue large, elliptical, attached by an elongated central pedicel, and 

 free upon its posterior third. Eyes large. Limbs slender, anterior ones longest ; 

 four fingers ; five toes, all free and tapering. Tail subcylindrical, slightly com- 

 pressed, tapering towards the tip. Skin exteriorly smooth and soft. 



Herbdia oregoxensis. Tail longer than the body and head together. Fingers 

 and toes slender and free, inner one very small. Skin smooth, uniform dark brown 

 above, lighter beneath. 



The Secretary read a note from Dr. Wm. S. Zantzinger, dated 29th 

 July, 1856, stating that he was about to remove from the city, and 

 consequently tendered his resignation as Librarian of the Academy. 

 The resignation was accepted. 



ELECTION. 



Baron John William Yon Miiller, of Stuttgart, was elected a Corres- 

 pondent, and Mr. Alfred Cope and Dr. Wm. H. Grobrecht, both of 

 Philadelphia, were elected members of the Academy. 



AuguHt bth. 



Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Hallowell presented for publication in the Proceedings, a paper 

 entitled " Notes on the Reptiles in the collection of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, by Edward Hallowell, M. D. ;" also 

 a paper entitled "On several new Reptiles in the collection of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, by Edward Hallowell, 

 M. D." Both these papers were referred to a Committee consisting of 

 Dr. Leidy, Mr. Cassin and Mr. Schafhirt, 



Dr. Hallowell exhibited numerous specimens of the larvae of Bufo Ame- 

 ricanus. These were caught by Dr. Leidy on the 16th of June, along the banks 

 of the Schuylkill, near Philadelphia. They are nine lines in length, including 

 the tail, of a slate color above, with dark colored spots ; the under parts are 

 whitish mingled with gray. The reason why the tadpoles of the toad are not 

 more often seen, is probably on account of their small size. Specimens of the 

 perfect animal were also exhibited ; these were six lines in length, of a grey 

 color above, with numerous small dark colored spots, containing each one or 

 more minute reddish colored ones ; these smaller spots were also distributed 

 over the body ; under parts whitish ; the perfect specimens were found July 7th, 

 1856, among stones quite close to the river. 



Dr. Hallowell also exhibited a number of specimens of Rana halecina, Kalm, 

 found in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, both male and female. The females 

 appear to be of a somewhat lighter color than the males, and have fewer spots. 

 The latter are all provided with a vocal sac, one on each side, communicating 

 with a small circular opening, not quite a line in diameter, beneath the lower 

 jaw near its angle, nearly opposite the eustachian foramina. 



Dumeril and Bibron, in their Erpetologie Generale, tom. viii., p. 353, remark, 

 that in comparing the Rana esculenta of Europe, and the Rana halecina, the 

 first thing to be observed is, that the Rana halecina is not provided at the angles 

 of the mouth with those slits which permit the males to extend their vocal sacs, 




142 [August 



which is the case in the common frog of Europe. Dr. Holbrook also states, in 

 presenting the distinctive characters between the two animals, that in Rana 

 halecina " there are no openings on the sides of the jaws, at the angle of the mouth, 

 out of which the vocal vesicles pass when distended with air, as in the Rana 

 esculenta." So far from this being the case, it is the only frog in the United 

 States which appears to possess the sexual characters above mentioned. Both 

 authors quote among the synonyms of halecina, the Rana utricularia of Harlan, 

 which is the male halecina with distended vocal A^esicles. The error has arisen 

 from the fiict, as stated to me by Dr. Holbrook, that the males of a species found 

 in the Southern States resembling the halecina, do not possess the vocal vesi- 

 cles. "We have latelj^ received from Florida a male specimen, found by our 

 fellow member, Mr. Ashmead, in a sulphur spring, near the St. John's River, 

 about three hundred miles from Key West, which is totally destitute of these 

 vesicles. It resembles very much the halecina, but differs from it, in having 

 a more acute snout, with a much more slender body and extremities; the 

 general color is darker, the black spots more numerous, and the markings upon 

 the thighs are different; it should be remembered however, that this description 

 is based upon a single specimen. A more important character exists in the 

 presence of a broad and very distinct and well marked row of pores along the 

 upper part of each flank, in the true halecina, and their presence also above 

 the orbits, upon the back part of the head and neck, and various parts of the 

 body ; these all appear to be wanting in the Southern species. Dumeril and 

 Bibron very consistently place the animal they describe in the second division 

 of the Ranidse, including those "without pores about the neck, upon the belly, 

 and none upon the flanks.'' We do not observe, however, in the specimen 

 before us, that the thumbs are decidedly truncate. 

 We would propose the name of Rana oxyrhynchus for the Southern species. 



Rana oxyrhynchus, nob. 



Char. Plead narrow, acute, longer than broad; body and extremities slender, 

 the posterior quite long; four or five palatine teeth on each side, very distinct, 

 between the internal nares; the patches near to each other, but a considerable 

 distance from the former ; tympanum rather small ; eustachian foramina of mode- 

 rate size; tongue narrow ; scarcely a trace of webs to the anterior toes; poste- 

 rior reaching just beyond the proximal extremity of the third phalanx of fourth 

 toe; third finger the longest; fourth toe much longer than either of the others ; 

 thumbs not remarkably swollen at their base ; subarticular tubercles not very 

 distinct; no rows of pores upon the sides, and none visible upon the head or 

 other parts of the body. 



Color. Dark olive, inclining to black above ; two black bands on each side 

 reaching from the eye to the extremity of the snout ; a narrow white band ex- 

 tending from the latter on each side beneath the t^^mpanum, in contact with it, 

 and terminating just above the shoulder ; another narrow white line, the cuticle 

 here being slightly elevated, passing from the posterior margin of the eye to the 

 upper part of the thigh, near the middle ; two dark oval spots upon the head 

 between the eyes, and upon the back ; fifteen or sixteen black oval spots, each 

 surrounded by a narrow white margin, between the lateral dorsal vittae ; ante- 

 rior extremities black spotted above ; posterior presenting upon their upper sur- 

 face several transverse bars of black margined with white, the posterior siirface 

 mottled with the same colors ; legs and tarsi spotted with black ; ground color 

 greyish above ; sides of body greyish, marbled and spotted with black and white 

 spots and markings; under surface of animal white throughout; (from a speci- 

 men in spirits.) 



Dimensions. Length of head 11 lines: greatest breadth 7 ; length of head, 

 neck and body 1 inch 10 lines ; length of thigh 1 inch ; of leg 1 inch 1 line; of 

 tarsus and foot to extremity of largest toe 1 inch 7 lines ; total length 5 inches. 



Habitat. Florida. 



It is a subject of doubt, whether the animal figured in Prof. Holbrook's work 

 be the true halecina or not; for in his description he says " a second line of yel- 




1856.] US 



lowish white extends from the nose to the shoulder ; the latter is less extensive 

 in the male animal, ending at the Tocal sac " Vol. iv. p. 91. And jet, at the end 

 of the chapter on Rana halecina, it is stated as above mentioned, that " there 

 are no openings at the sides of the jaws, at the angle of the mouth, out of which 

 the vocal vesicles pass when distended with air." Except that the sacs are not 

 represented, the figure would correspond sufficiently well with the R. halecina of 

 Kalm. There can be no doubt that the R. esculenta (R. viridis, Roesel, fluvia- 

 tilis, Rondeletius) is different from halecina, although resembling it very much. 

 One of the most important differences consists in the presence in the former, 

 upon the back, of numerous tubercles, each penetrated by one or more pores, 

 giving it a somewhat toad-like appearance ; another is the absence in the escu- 

 lenta of the conglomerated pores upon the neck and other parts of the upper 

 surface of the animal. Of the latter we have at least fifty specimens in the col- 

 lection of the Academy. 



Oq leave granted, Mr. Cassin offered the following Preamble and 

 Resolutions, which were unanimously adopted : 



Whereas, The resignation of William S. Zantzinger, M. D.,as Libra- 

 rian of this Academy, has been presented on account of his removal 

 from this city : 



Resolved, That in accepting the resignation of Dr. Zantzinger as Li- 

 brarian, the members of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadel- 

 phia are deeply sensible of the loss the Society has sustained in thus 

 parting with an esteemed associate, and an efl&cient and faithful officer 

 and member. 



Resolved, That the thanks of the Academy be presented to Dr. Zant- 

 zinger, as a testimony of bis valuable services as Recording Secretary, 

 Librarian and Member of the Committee on Proceedings. 



Resolved, That the Committee on Proceedings and the Publication 

 Committee of this Academy, be directed to present in the name of the 

 Academy complete setts of all its publications, or so much thereof as 

 he may require to complete copies that he may have, and to continue to 

 send the same to him as published, gratuitously.

Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Mr. A. H. Smith exhibited a specimen of amygdaloidal trap from 

 Lake Superior, in which the zeolitic matter filling the cavities is en- 

 crusted and partially replaced by green carbonate of copper. 



Dr. Bridges suggested that the zeolitic matter might have been dis- 

 solved by a solution of carbonic acid; and the oxide of copper dissolved 

 by the same agent, and, impregnating the soil, would more or less 

 replace the mineral. 



Dr. Rand announced the death of J. Madison Rush, late Lieutenant 

 U. S. N., and member of this Academy, in the 35tb year of his age.

Description of a neiv species of Hylafrom Georgia. 

 By John Le Conte. 



During the last spring, whilst I was residing in the lower country of Georgia, 

 it was my good fortune to meet with three specimens of the animal described 

 below. One of them was taken in the water of a pine barren pond, another 

 was found in a cavity of a sand pit, and the third upon a tree in the forest. 



This Hyla is remarkable for its size, approaching in this respect to those 

 found in tropical regions. Two of them were of a greenish dusky ; the second, 

 who had concealed himself in a hole in the sand, was of a bright pea green, but 

 in the space of half an hour changed to the color of the others, thus showing a 

 complete possession of the faculty of changing color at will, so remarkable in 

 many of the Batrachia. 



There yet remain undiscovered and undescribed, in Georgia, three species of 

 this genus, which have as yet eluded my search. The notes of these are re- 

 markably distinct from those of others ; I may hereafter be fortunate enough 

 to obtain them. 



Hyla gratiosa. 



Coarsely granulate both above and beneath. Color above varying at the will 

 of the animal from bright green to cinereous and to greenish dusky, with round- 

 ish spots or irregular blotches of darker, or speckled with variously shaped 

 dots of the same, all of them with some few small yellow irregularly disposed 

 spots on the back and sides. Beneath whitish, more or less inclining to yellow 

 or orange. Upper lip white, or white varied with green or dusky ; lower lip 

 sometimes whitish, at others of the color of the back : in some a white line ex- 

 tends from the upper lip along the side to the insertion of the hind leg, in others 

 the sides are variegated with rounded spots of darker, and no line visible. Irids 

 black varied with golden ; tympanum copper-colored, a considerable depression 

 between the nostrils and the eyes. Chin varied with dusky or green, with a 

 slight fold at the bottom ; transverse space between the arms smooth, without 

 any granulations. Arms and legs barred, with darker, yellowish or reddish on 

 the under side, the former smooth beneath, the latter granulate on the poste- 

 rior half; the under side of the posterior half of the thighs is smooth. Disks of 

 the toes very large. 



Length of head and body 2-5 inches ; humerus -6 ; autibrachium -6; hand -75; 

 femur 1-2 ; tibia 1-15 ; foot 1-6. 



Notes on the Reptiles in the collection of the Museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences. 



By Edwaed Hallowell, M. D. 



It is not surprising that, among the reptiles of the Academy, which it has 

 required more than forty years to bring to its present although incomplete con- 

 dition, and which is now for the first time in process of classification and 

 arrangement, there should be many new species that do not appear to exist 

 even in the large European collections. It is possible, however, that some of 

 these may be mere varities, or they may be already known ; but after careful 

 inquiry, I have not been able to make them out as such, and the interests of 

 science,' it appears to me, will be best subserved by their publication, even should 

 the account of them hereafter be found to contain a few errors. 



Fam. CAMELEONID^. 



Lf zards Camloniens ou Sacrians Ch^lopodel, Dum. et Bib. 



Among the Cameleonidse in the collection of the Academy, we find two which 



differ from any of those described in the work of Dumeril and Bibron, and in 



the Memoir of Prof. Aug. Dumeril, in the Archiv. du Museum, tome vi., p. 210. 



Neither are they found in the Catalogue of the Lacertians of the British Museum, 




1856.] 147 



by Mr. Gray. They may be new species, or ouly varieties of those already de- 

 termined. Future and more extended observation will settle this point. 



ChamjELeo granulosus, nob. 



This Chameleon is much larger than any of the specimens we have of dilepis 

 or of gracilis from W. Afriea, resembling somewhat in size the Ch. pardalis of 

 Madagascar, but it is not so stout. 



Char. Outline of head above oval, somewhat narrower in front than poste- 

 riorly ; lateral crests not meeting in front ; central keel very low, hardly percep- 

 tible ; spaces on each side, between it and the lateral crest, depressed, slightly 

 rounded, occupied with polygonal tubercles of unequal size ; supraciliary ridge 

 high, subcircular ; back and upper part of tail denticulated, the denticulations 

 larger near the neck, having there the form of a crest ; a crest upon chin, throat 

 and abdomen, none under the tail. Scales upon sides unequal, tubercular ; foiir 

 or five rows of flat quadrangular scales between the dorsal denticulations and 

 the lateral tubercles. 



Description. The outline of the head above resembles that of Chamreleo sene- 

 galensis, but is less narrow in front ; the supraciliary crest is also much more 

 elevated ; it differs from gracilis in having a trace only of the bifurcations of 

 the central keel, and in being covered with tubercles and smooth polygonal 

 scales ; the scales, both upon the head and sides of the body, are larger and 

 more tubercular than in Senegalensis, the general shape of the head is different, 

 and the present species is considerably larger. It may, however, be only a 

 variety of Senegalensis, or perhaps the male. Color greyish, with a tinge of 

 blue upon the abdomen. 



Dimensions. Length of head I inch T lines ; breadth above, between the supra- 

 ciliary crests, 7 lines ; length of neck and body to vent 4 inches ; of tail 5 inches ; 

 total length 10 inches 1 lines. 



Habitat. West Africa. One specimen presented by Mr. Cassin. 



Oham^leo Burchelli. 



Char. Rather larger than C. dilepis. Outline of head above resembling some- 

 what that of Charateleo pardalis, but less narrow, prolonged, with lateral crests 

 much more depressed and the interspace more shallow ; central keel very low, 

 interspace between it and lateral crests occupied with flattened polygonal scales 

 of unequal size; supraciliary ridge low, the lateral crests not in contact anteri- 

 orly ; scales upon the sides of the head rather large, flattened, with a slight ele- 

 vation in the centre, polygonal ; back denticulated, more slightly posteriorly ; a 

 few spines upon neck ; throat and abdomen denticulated ; scales of body unequal,

GECKOTID^. 



LIZARDS Geckotiens, ou Sauriens Ascalabotes, D. & B. 



The family Geckotidae are divided by Dumeril and Bibron into seven genera 

 l,Platydactylus ; 2, Hemidactylus ; 3, Ptyodactylus ; 4, Phyllodactylus ; 5, Sphse- 

 riodactylus ; 6, Gymnodactylus ; 7, Stenodactylus. The Geckotians described 

 in this paper belong to the genera Hemidactylus and Gymnodactylus, the for- 

 mer thus characterized : 



Hemidactylus, Cuvier, Gray, Wagler, Weigmann. 

 Char. Base of the four or five fingers of each extremity enlarged into a disk. 




148 [August, 



from the middle of which project the two last phalanges, which are slender. In- 

 ferior surface of this disk covered with imbricate feuillets, for the most part, 

 arranged en chevron. A longitudinal band of large plates under the tail. (Dume- 

 ril et Bibron.) 



The Hemidactyles are divided by Dumeril and Bibron into two sections. 1, 

 the Dactyloperes, with thumbs, as it were, truncated, of which there are two 

 groups \, with entire subdigital laminse, and B_. with divided (echanchrees) 

 subdigitax laminae; and 2d, the Dactyloteles, or with five complete fingers nar- 

 rowed at the point. These are also divided into two groups A, the D. fissi- 

 pedes, and B. the D. palmipedes, the latter only having palmated fingers, and 

 comprising but two species, viz.: H. marginatus and H. sebffi; the former, or the 

 fissipeds, thirteen, inhabiting Malabar, (trisedrus.) Phillipines, Isle Maurice, 

 Bombay, (maculatus,) border of the Mediterranean, Toulon, Rome, Sicily, 

 Greece, Senegal. Trebizonde, Chili, Vera Cruz, Buenos Ayres, (vermiculatus,) 

 W. Indies, Cayenne, Brazil, Carthagena, Martinique, (mabouia,) Ceylon, 

 (Leschenaultii,) Bengal, Bombay, (Coctasi,) S. Africa, Indian Archipelago, 

 Madagascar, Isle of France, Ceylon, Amboina, Java, Timor, Marianne Islands, 

 (frenatus,) Otaheite, (Garnotii,) and Peru (Peruvianus.) 



Sect. Dactyloteles fissipedes, D. & B. (Five nails, fingers and toes free.) 



Hemidactylus formosus, nob. 



Char. Nine inferior labial plates, the two first the largest; mental plate 

 broad, triangular, immediately behind it two quadrangular plates, much smaller 

 than the mental; ten superior labials; 17 femoral pores on each thigh in the 

 males ; a broad dark colored blotch bordered with white, upon the back, extend- 

 ing in the form of a crescent to the posterior margin of the orbit ; three broad 

 quadrangular brownish blotches, margined with white, upon the back ; tail 

 banded with brown ; 9 or 10 rows of circular tubercles on each side of the me- 

 dian line of the body. 



Description. The head of this remarkable species is large, swollen at the 

 temples, presenting a marked depression along its middle. The nostrils are 

 situated immediately behind the rostral plate, a little above the first labial, and 

 are somewhat triangular in shape ; between them, and in contact, are two small 

 narrow plates, behind the rostral, with a smaller one intermediate ; the head is 

 covered with small granulations superiorly, the front with tubercles ; of the ten 

 superior labial plates, the first is the largest ; the inferior margin of the eyelid 

 passes beneath the globe of the eye, the superior above it, and is covered with 

 small granulations and rhomboidal scales, its external border denticulated ; body 

 and extremities robust, the former covered with granulations, with nine or ten 

 longitudinal rows on each side of the median line of circular tubercles ; elbows 

 and posterior surface of forearms covered with granulations ; arms anteriorly 

 and beneath with scales ; the fingers and toes are each provided with a nail, free ; 

 eight subdigital lamina; beneath the fourth finger ; no lateral membranes to the 

 body or tail. Chin and throat covered with granulations ; abdomen and under 

 part of extremities with quadrangular scales; 1*7 to 19 pores along the under 

 part of each thigh, in the males, none in front of the anus ; tail long and tapering, 

 much longer than body, (\\ inches,) presenting beneath a well-defined central 

 row of hexagonal scales, much broader than long, bordered on each side with 

 smaller scales irregularly disposed. 



Coloration. Ground color above dusky white, with a tinge of reddish brown, 

 the brownish red tints predominating; a large dark brown blotch upon the neck 

 bordered thinly with white, with crescentic prolongations reaching to the poste- 

 rior margin of the eye ; three broad transverse brown blotches (3 to 3 J lines) 

 upon the back, bordered with white, and separated from each other by inter- 

 spaces of about the same length as the blotches ; tail banded with brown above 

 and upon the sides. 



Dimensions. Length of head 7 lines ; greatest breadth 7 ; length of neck and 

 body to arms 2 inches 1^ lines ; length of tail 3 inches 4 lines ; total length 6 

 inches 4^ lines. 




1856.] 149 



Habitat. Liberia, west coast of Africa. Three specimens presented by Dr. 

 Savage. 



Tlie young is of a very light straw color above, with three transverse bands 

 about two lines in breadth, of a beautiful yellow color ; blotch upon neck similar 

 in form to that of adult, but of a beautiful light yellow color; under parts straw 

 color ; no minute black points upon the scales. 



Dimensions of a young specimen. Length of head 6 lines ; greatest breadth 

 3^ ; length of neck and body to tail 1 inch 3 lines ; (tail mutilated.) 



The Gymnodactyles are separated by Dumeril and Bibron into two divisions, 

 viz., the Gymnodactyles homonotes, in which the scales of the back are equal, 

 and into Gymnodactyles heteronotes, in which the upper parts of the body are 

 sprinkled with tubercles more or less developed. The species now described 

 belongs to the latter division. 



Gen. GYMNODACTYLUS. 



Char. Five nails not retractile to all the feet ; toes not dilated transversely, 

 nor denticulated upon their edges ; the fifth of the posterior toes versatile, or 

 capable of being removed from the others at a right angle. (Dumeril et Bibron, 

 tome 3, p. 408.) 



Gymnodactylus tenuis, nob. 



Char. Head rather long, front depressed ; nine inferior labial plates, the 

 four first broader than the others ; two plates behind the mental, followed by 

 three others in contact with the labials, not so large ; ten superior labials ; ros- 

 tral broader than long ; two quadrangular oblique plates posterior to it, with a 

 smaller one between them; nostrils circular, their inferior border in contact 

 with the first labial, the anterior margia formed by the quadrangular plates 

 above described, the posterior by a small semi-circular scale, the superior by a 

 small irregularly shaped plate ; head covered with smooth granulations, some- 

 what larger upon the sides ; the eyebrow presenting numerous quadrangular 

 scales, forms a complete circle around the eye ; auricular openings oval, without 

 denticulations ; extremities quite slender ; fingers and toes slender, each provided 

 with a small recurved nail, with the exception of the thumb ; scales beneath 

 the fingers and toes single ; body slender ; tail longer than body, tapering to a 

 point, with a row of broad scales beneath. 



Coloration. Brownish above, upon the body, lighter beneath ; tail yellowish, 

 banded with brown. 



3feasurement.s. Length of head 7 lines ; greatest breadth 4 ; length of body 

 1 inch, (Fr. ;) of tail 1 inch 2 J lines. 

 Habitat. Manilla. One specimen presented by Dr. Burroughs. 



Fam. VARANID.E. 



Lezards Varaniens or Sauriens Platynotes, D. & B. 



We do not find among the Varanians in the collection of the Academy any 

 which appear to be new, with the exception of the specimen now described, 

 presented several years ago by Dr. Kane. The Museum at present contains the 

 following species, viz., V. niloticus, (10 specimens,) V. Bengalensis, (3 sp.,) V. 

 bivittatus, (4 sp.,) V. Piqotii, (2 sp.,) V. arenarius, (1 sp.,) V. ocellatus ; (1 sp.,) 

 the two last from the Garden of Plants in exchange. The specimen presented 

 by Dr. Kane is the largest, by far, in the collection, and of greater dimensions 

 than those of any of the Varanians, with the exception of the gigantic lace lizard 

 of N. Holland, (Hydrosaurus giganteus. Gray,) described by Mr. Gray in the 

 "Zoology" of the Erebus and Terror, part vi., Feb., 1845, 6i feet in length. 




150 [August, 



Varanus olivaceus, nob. 



Char. The head is large, pyramidal, broad posteriorly, slender and some- 

 what obtuse in front; the scales above the orbits are flattened, polygonal, several 

 rows of unequal size, much larger than the rest, and three intermediate between 

 the orbits and in front, still larger ; the largest, however, are situated at the ex- 

 tremity of the snout above, and are placed in two transverse rows ; the scales 

 upon the back part of the head are more uniform in size ; those upon the temples 

 small ; the nostrils are two oblique openings placed about midway between 

 the extremity of the snout and the anterior canthus of the eye, their inferior ex- 

 tremity in a line with the latter ; scales upon neck and body stnall, oval, sur- 

 rounded with two rows of small granules, those upon the back more distinctly 

 carinated, especially in its posterior part towards the tail, where the carinations 

 are strongly developed ; the scales upon the extremities are considerably larger 

 than those upon the body, and likewise carinated, the posterior much more dis- 

 tinctly than the anterior ; scales upon chin and throat smaller than the others, 

 those upon under surface of extremities smooth ; those upon abdomei! slender, 

 quadrangular, two lines in length, and about half a line in breadth, in trans- 

 verse rows; tail circular, much longer than head, neck and body, surrounded 

 with transverse rows of carinated elongate scales, with a slightly developed crest 

 tapering gradually toward the end, where it is somewhat compressed ; extremi- 

 ties well developed ; fingers and toes provided with strong and powerful claws, 

 third and fourth fingers of nearly equal length ; transverse rows of large quad- 

 rangular scales beneath the fingers and toes, 16 rows beneath the second finger, 

 24 beneath the fourth. 



Cloloration. Ground color olive above, lighter below, with obscure dark co- 

 lored spots and markings. 



Dimensions. Length of head 5 inches, (Fr. ;) greatest breadth 3 inches ; length 

 of neck and body 1 foot 9^ inches ; length of tail 3 feet ; of arm 3 inches, of fore- 

 arm 3 inches 4 fines ; of thigh 3| inches ; of legs 3^ inches ; of longest finger, 

 including nail, 3 inches 1 line. Total length 5 feet 2^ inches ; circumference 1 

 foot 5J inches. 



Habitat. Manilla. One specimen presented by Dr. Kane, TJ. S. N. 



Gen. Remarks. The species above described approaches nearest the Hydro- 

 saurus giganteus of Mr. Gray, but is destitute of the transverse rows of ocel- 

 lated spots upon the back, and the spots upon the extremities and tail. In Mr. 

 Gray's species the shields over the orbits are very small and granular, but in the 

 one just described there exist above the orbit several rows of polygonal scales, 

 some of them a line in diameter, succeeded by several larger rows, and between 

 these, four or five rows of bro^d hexagonal plates. 



The Varanidas, divided into two sections by Dumeril and Bibron, the terres- 

 trial and aquatic, the former with a round tail and slightly developed crest, 

 comprise two genera only, viz., Varanus and Heloderma, the former containing 

 twelve, the latter but one species (horridum.) 



None of this family exist in Europe, and but one is found in America, viz., 

 Heloderma horridum, which inhabits Mexico. Of the others, four inhabit Asia, 

 three Africa, and four Oceanica ; of the latter, two New Holland, (Bellii and 

 varius,) onethe Japan Islands, (chlorostigma,) one Timor, (Timoriensis.) In 

 Asia there are four species, viz., Bengalensis, nebulosus, Diardii and bi-vittatus. 

 Three inhabit Africa, viz., arenarius, (Egypt,) niloticus, (Nile, rivers of Cape of 

 Good Hope, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Gaboon country,) and ocellatus, (Abys- 

 sinia and Senegal.) With the exception of bi-vittatus and olivaceus, all these 

 have small scales or granulations over the orbits. 



Fam. IGUANID^. 

 Sauriens Eunotes, Dumeril et Bibron. 

 Gen. HoLOTROPis. 

 Char. " Head in the form of a quadrangular pyramid ; cephalic plates of mode- 

 rate size, angular, almost equal ; a very small occipital ; supra-ocular scutella 




1856.] 151 



dilated transversely ; the other plates oblong ; neck smooth below, folded irregu- 

 larly npon the sides ; an oblique fold of the skin before each shoulder ; anterior 

 edge of the ear denticulated ; trunk subtrijedral, covered with imbricated scales 

 of medium size, provided with carinfB, terminating in an acute point, and form- 

 ing oblique lines converging towards the middle region of the back. A denticu- 

 lated crest extending from the nucha to the extremity of the tail ; the latter 

 long, compressed; exterior edge of the two or three posterior fingers dentciu- 

 lated ; no pores either in front of the anus or upon thighs." (D. et B.) Of 

 this genus two species are described by Dumeril and Bibron, viz., Herminieri 

 and Microlophus ; the first with a well developed crest and carinated ventral 

 scales, the second with a very small crest and smooth ventral scales. In the first 

 species the tail is strongly compressed, in the second very slightly. The species 

 described in this paper was deposited in the Museum some time ago by Dr. 

 Morris, and differs considerably from the last of the before-mentioned species, 

 although resembling it in several important particulars, viz., the low crest and 

 smooth ventral scales. 



HOLOTROPIS VITTATUS, nob. 



Char. Crest low, as in Microlophus, much more developed upon the tail ; 

 ventral scales smooth; nasal plate quite different in shape from that represented 

 in the figure of Microlophus in de la Sagra, tab. vii., fig. A., (Reptiles,) being al- 

 most as broad as long ; the nostril is situated immediately at its posterior edge, 

 and not at some distance from it, as represented in the figure above mentioned ; 

 the plates upon the head are all very strongly carinated ; the carinse upon the 

 dorsal scales are not situated in the middle, but a little to one side ; the five 

 middle rows of abdominal scales larger than the others. 



Coloration. Probably altered by alcohol ; crest greenish ; ground color dark 

 green, with reflections of bronze : a large black blotch upon each temple ; a 

 whitish colored vitta immediately beneath, extending upon the neck ; another 

 beginning above and in advance of the shoulder, extending along the sides of the 

 body as far as the thighs ; two transverse parallel bands of black across the 

 chin ; the interspaces and under parts of jaw whitish ; throat greenish ; abdomen, 

 under parts of extremities and tail of a much lighter color than upon the back. 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch, greatest breadth 9 lines ; length of neck 

 and body 2 inches 9 lines ; of tail 4 inches 4 lines ; total length 8 inches 1 line. 



Habitat. Cuba, One specimen in Mus. Acad., deposited by Dr. Morris. 



Ord. OPHIDIA. 

 Gen. Teopidonotus, Kuhl. 



Char. "Jaws long, teeth of the upper forming a continuous longitudinal 

 series, although the last or posterior are generally stronger and longer by nearly 

 one-half, and never channelled; scales of the back, and more often those of the 

 sides, presenting a saliant line or sort of carina ; tail of moderate length." 

 Dnmeril and Bibron, T. vii., p. 549. 



The Tropidonotes belong, in the arrangement of Dumeril and Bibron, to the 

 second section or sub-order of Ophidians, viz., the Aglyphodont or Azimiopbid 

 serpents, which are characterized as having recurved, conical, rounded, full and 

 smooth teeth, without canulation at their points, and implanted in both jaws. 

 T. ii. p. 19. Twenty species are described by them, existing in Europe as far 

 north as Norway, N. Africa, Greece, N. America, Seychelles, Java, borders of 

 the Caspian Sea, E. Indies, Japan, Manilla, N. Guinea and Australia. The 

 greater number appear to inhabit N. America. It is very remarkable that, 

 although so numerous in the U. States, they should not be found in the Southern 

 portion of the American continent. 



Tropidonotds annularis, nob. 



Char. Nostrils between two plates ; internasals long and narrow ; a frenal ; 

 one antocular, three postocular plates; eight superior labials, the eye resting on 




152 [August, 



the fourth ; prseanal scute bifid ; scales very distinctly carinated, except the 

 three inferior rows, which are smooth ; color above ash ; beneath yellow, with 

 transverse dark colored blotches, arranged for the most part alternately, 

 extending upon the sides ; these blotches extend about half way across the 

 abdomen ; the broadest occupy two scales, the most narrow usually but one, 

 and occasionally unite in the middle; 19 rows of scales; 159 abdom. scuta: 

 33 bifid sub-caudal. 



Dimensions. Total length 2 ft. 6 J inches, (Fr. ;) length of tail 3 in. 8 lines. 



Habitat. Ningpo, China. One specimen, in excellent preservation, in Mus. 

 Acad., presented by Dr. McCartee. 



Gen. CORONELLA. 



The genus Coronella, established by Laurenti in 1768, is placed by Dumeril 

 and Bibron with the Tropidonotes in the family of Syncrateriens, having " all the 

 teeth smooth, distributed in the same line, but with the last longer, without a free 

 interspace in front of them." T. vii. p. 525. The genus is thus characterized: 



" Serpents with superior maxillary teeth longer and upon the same line with 

 the others, without interval ; trunk elongated ; tail moderate ; scales smooth ; 

 snout rounded and a little elongated." Dum. et Bib., tom. vii. p. 607. 



Seven species only are described by them, which inhabit Central and South- 

 ern Europe, Cape of Good Hope, (cana,) U. States, (getulus, Sayi, doliata, Cali- 

 fornica.) To these may be added one formerly described by me from W.Africa, 

 (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.,) C. triangularis, and the present species from China. 

 Others will no doubt be determined hereafter. 



Coronella striata, nob. 



Char. Head short and thick, rostral plate large and slightly prominent, more 

 extended transversely ; internasals two in number, somewhat quadrangular, 

 smaller than prefrontals ; prefrontals large and quadrangular, frontal broad and 

 short ; occipitals large ; nostrils between two plates, a long quadrangular plate 

 reaching from the posterior nasal to the eye, with a small quadrangular plate 

 above it, between the eye and the prefrontal ; two posterior orbitals ; eight supe- 

 rior labials, the four first narrow, the remainder broad, with the inferior margin 

 of the orbil formed by the fourth and fifth ; scales smooth and quadrangular, 

 17 rows ; body long and robust ; head thicker than neck ; tail of moderate length, 

 pointed. 



Coloration. Head brown above, the margins of the plates edged with white ; 

 jaws and throat white; a brown blotch behind the eye extending to near the 

 commissure of the mouth ; a broader one upon the occiput bordered posteriorly 

 with white ; behind the white stripe on either side, which commences near the 

 posterior extremity of the occipital plate, a large brown blotch ; upon the back 

 a row of 47 quadrate brown blotches, the interspaces white ; sides spotted with 

 brown ; abdomen straw color, immaculate ; thirteen blotches upon the tail ex- 

 tending upon the sides, with intervening white bands as upon the body ; under 

 part of tail brown spotted. 



Abdom. scuta 193; prseanal single ; subcaudal 70. 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch 6 lines, greatest breadth 1 inch, (Fr. ;) 

 length of body 2 feet 11| inches ; greatest circumference 3 inches 3 lines ; length 

 of tail 8 inches. Total length 3 feet ten lines ; greatest circumference 3 inches 

 3 lines. 



Habitat. Ningpo, China. Two specimens in Mus. Acad., presented by Dr. 

 McCartee, one fully grown, another younger, and the head and neck of a third. 

 In one of these specimens there is a distinct anterior orbital plate, with a long 

 quadrangular loral between it and the posterior nasal. 



CROTALID^. 



We have also two specimens^of Trigonocephali from Ningpo, China, presented 

 by Dr. McCartee, which correspond with the description of Dumeril and Bibron, 




1856.] 153 



and Siobold and Schlegel's excellent drawing of Trigonoccphalus Blomhoffii, 

 and are no doubt the same. 141 abdonj. so. ; 39 subcaudal ; 21 rows of scales, 

 (25, according to Schlegel.) Total length of one specimen 1 foot 4^ inches, 

 (Fr. :) length of tail 1 inch 7 lines ; length of another specimen 1 foot f inches ; 

 of tail 2 inches 4 lines. The tail, therefore, appears to be somewhat shorter 

 than is indicated by the description of Professors Dumeril and Schlegel, who 

 make it one-sixth of the whole length of the animal. They state that the Tri- 

 gonoccphalus Blomhoffii is the only venomous serpent found in Japan. 



EANID^. 



Among the reptiles recently sent to the Academj^ by M. Duchaillu, are four 

 fine specimens of Chamseleo dilepis, and a large serpent formerly described by 

 me in the Proceedings of the Acad. N. S., Vol. vi. p. 205, (Dendrophis flavigu- 

 laris.) The only reptiles in the collection of M. Duchaillu that are not new, are 

 four frogs, all belonging to the same species. Two of this family are already 

 known to the collection, viz., Rana Bibrcnii, nob. (abundant,) and Hyla punc- 

 tata, of which we have but one specimen. 



Rana albolabris, nob. 



Char. Head triangular, depressed above ; snout slightly rounded ; eyes pro- 

 minent ; nostrils latero-superior, two lines apart ; openings for the internal nares 

 small and subcircular ; between them two converging lines of vomerine teeth ; 

 eustachian foramina larger than the openings of the internal nares ; tongue ob- 

 cordate, attached in front, free at the sides, notched posteriorly ; back more or 

 less granulated ; a raised and well marked lateral fold on each side, extending 

 from the posterior margin of the eye to the extremity of the coccyx ; tym- 

 panum circular, of moderate size, fingers free ; subarticular tubercles distinct ; 

 base of toe much swollen ; toe and first finger of equal length, third about a 

 line longer than the fourth ; anterior extremities moderately robust ; posterior 

 also webbed, extending to the distal extremity of the antepenultimate phalanx 

 in all the toes except the fourth, in which it extends to the proximal extremity 

 of the same phalanx ; subarticular tubercles of toes less developed than those 

 of fingers. 



Coloration. Dark brown above, with obscure transverse bars of a deeper 

 color upon posterior extremities ; anterior extremities blotched with darker 

 brown ; a white stripe extending from the extremity of the snout, beneath the 

 eye, and tympanum as far as the anterior extremity ; a small white spot above 

 the shoulder, which appears to be constant, and in several of the specimens a 

 row of smaller white spots along the sides irregularly disposed. In two of the 

 specimens the back presents a marked tinge of olive ; the brown upon the side 

 of the head is somewhat deeper than upon the back, resembling in this respect 

 the Rana sylvatica, Le Conte, of which indeed it may be considered the repre- 

 sentative in West Africa. Under parts whitish, more or less mingled with 

 brown ; in some specimens the brown very greatly predominates ; under surface 

 of thighs more or less spotted with brown. 



Dimensions. Length of head 9 lines, greatest breadth 8 lines ; length of head, 

 neck and body 1 inch 10 lines to 2 inches 1 line; length of posterior extremities 

 3 inches 2 lines ; of anterior 1 inch 3 lines ; length of longest toe 9 lines ; of 

 longest finger 5J. 



Habitat. W. Africa. Four specimens presented by M. Duchaillu.

 a frontal-hexagonal, broader in front ; two fronto-parietals ; one inter-parietal ; 

 two parietals ; no occipital ; a freno-nasal ; a large and broad frenal ; two freno- 

 orbitar plates ; seven superior labials ; nostrils pyriform, broader end above, 

 three or four scales upon its anterior border ; third and fourth fingers of equal 

 length ; body robust ; scales hezagoaal, 24 rows ; tail long and tapering, robust 

 and cyclo-tetragonal at base ; posterior extremities much shorter than anterior ; 

 second toe much the longest, with 14 distinct transverse scales ; palms of ante- 

 rior and lobes of posterior extremities tuberculated ; six prseanal scales, the two 

 middle ones quite large ; pterygoid teeth ; tongue slightly notched in front, 

 broad and deeply notched posteriorly, squamiform posteriorly. 



Color. Olive above, with four dark colored and more or less interrupted bands 

 upon the back and tail, the black spots forming these bands, which are not very

 much larger than in others ; posterior part of scales upon sides marked with 

 black. 



Dimensions. Length of head 10 lines, greatest breadth 6^ ; length of neck, 

 body and vent 3 inch, (Fr. ;) of tail 4 inches 6 lines. Total length 8 inches 3 

 lines. Circumference of body 2 inches 2 lines ; of tail at base 1 inch 7 lines. 

 Another specimen measured 9 inches in length, and the circumference of the 

 apparently older one was 2 inches 8 lines. 



Habitat. Ningpo, China. Five specimens presented by B. H. McCartee, M.D. 

 Nothing is known of its habits. 



Gen. Remarks. This animal is very probably the Plestiodon sinense of Du- 

 meril and Bibron, Tiliqua rubriventris, Gray, (Hardwicke's Illustrations of 

 Indian Zoology,) the descriptions of the scales corresponding, viz., olive bordered 

 with yellow, but they make no mention of the four dotted lines down the back, 

 which, however, are shown in Gray's figure, and they give one more row of 

 scales, viz., 25. We have one specimen from the same locality with three white 

 lines down the back bordered with black, probably the young of the above, and 

 which is perhaps identical with Plestiodon pulchrum, Dumeril and Bibron or 

 Tiliqua trivittata, Gray.

 central rows of black spots. Dumeril and Bibron observe that this species has 

 a very wide range, being found, according to them, in New Holland, Otaheite, 

 Java, the Isle of France, Morea and Peru. 



The entire number of species: of Scinecoidians or Lepidosaurian Lizards is 100 ;

By John Cassin. 



Gencs ]\IELIGN0THES, nobis. 



Bill short, thick and conical. Wings rather long ; second, third and fourth 

 quills longest and nearly equal. Tail moderate. Allied to the genus Indicator, 

 Vieillot. 



The short billed Indicators form a distinct group, easily recognized by the bill, 

 as above described. Heretofore there have been known Indicator minor, Stephens, 

 (/. minimum, Temm.) and Indicator xanthonotus, Blyth, belonging to this group, 

 but in neither of them is the bill so short and thick as in the two species that 

 we are now about to describe. 



1. MELICXOTnES CONIROSTEIS, HObiS. 



About the size of/, minor and resembling it, but with the bill thicker ; wings 

 shorter ; legs and toes longer. Bill short, thick, wide and rather suddenly com- 

 pressed at the tip ; nostrils large ; third and fourth quills slightly longest. Legs 

 stout; toes long ; tail moderate, rounded. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) 5| inches, wings 3j, tail 2\, bill i inch. 



Colors. Head above dark cinereous, every feather nearly black in the middle; 

 back, rump, upper tail co\'erts and wing coverts with every feather brownish 

 black in the middle and edged on both sides with golden yellow. Quills brown- 

 ish black, edged externally with the yellow of the back; narrow on the primaries, 

 wider on the secondaries. Feathers of the throat white at base, dark at their 

 tips. Small space on the abdomen and flanks white, with longitudinal stripes of 

 dark ashy brown. Other under parts and sides of the head and neck clear dark 

 cinereous, under tail coverts slightly edged with white. Under wing coverts 

 ashy. Tail, with the four central feathers brownish black, narrowly edged with 




1856.] 157 



yellow, olhers j-ellowish white, tipped with dark brown. Bill and feet bluish 

 black. 



Hah. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



(9^,5. jVs stated above, this species is about the size of /. minor, and some- 

 what resembles it. In addition to the differences already pointed out, this bird 

 has the bill entirelj' bluish black, not white at base of the under mandible as in 

 /. 7)ii?ior, and as carefully represented in Temm. PI. Col. 542. The colors are 

 much more clear and different from that species. The bill in the present bird is 

 r(>markably short and thick. 



This species may be that represented by Le Vaillant, Ois. d'Afrique, pi. 242, 

 but is very different from that represented in Cimelia Physica, pi. 24, A. The 

 latter is /. Sparrmanni, Stephens, but not the former. It is possible, too, that 

 this may be the bird alluded to by authors on the Ornithology of Western Africa 

 as /. minor, but it is distinct from that species of Southern Africa. 



2. Melignotees exilis, nobis. 



The smallest of all known birds of this group. Bill short, thick ; wings moder- 

 ate ; second and third quills slightly longest ; tail moderate ; legs and toes rather 

 strong. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) 4J inches, wings 2\, tail IJ inches. 



Entire upper plumage with every feather dark in the middle and edged on 

 both sides with greenish yellow, darker on the head. Quills dark brown, edged 

 e.'cternally with yellow. Entire under parts greenish cinereous, paler on the ab- 

 domen and nearly white on the ventral region. Tail with the four middle fea- 

 thers bi-ownish black, others yellowish white tipped with dark brown. Bill bluish 

 black ; base of under mandible yellowish white ; feet bluish black. 



Hab. River Moonda, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. This is the smallest Indicator yet discovered, and is a singular looking 

 little bird. The bill is short and thick, almost resembling that of some species 

 of Euphonia. This bird, in general appearance, bears some resemblance to the 

 preceding, but is much smaller and easily distinguished. One specimen only is 

 in the collection. 



Genus HET^ERODES, nobis. 



Allied to typical Indicator. Bill moderate, curved, slender, rather wide at base, 

 but rather abruptly compressed and tapering to the point ; wings rather long ; 

 second and third quills longest and nearly equal; tail moderate, containing ten 

 rather wide feathers ; tarsi and toes weak, slender, the two anterior rather lung. 

 Size of only known species small. 



3. Hbt;erodes insignis, nobis. 



Small, about the size of the last preceding and resembling it in color, but 

 with the bill totally different (as above described), and the feet .smaller and 

 slender. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) 4J inches, wing 2i, tail 1| inches. 



Colors. Entire upper parts dark olive, tinged with yellow, the latter prevail- 

 ing on the lower back and rump ; quills dark brown, edged externally with 

 greenish yellow ; narrow on the primaries, wider on the secondaries, and inter- 

 nally with yellowish white. Under parts ashy olive, darker on the breast, paler 

 and nearly white on the abdomen and under tail coverts. Under wing coverts 

 yellowish white. Tail with the four middle feathers dark olive brown, outer 

 "feathers yellowish white, edged with pure yellow. Bill and feet bluish black. 



jjab. Moonda river. Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. This is one of the most curious little birds that I have ever seen. It is 

 in all respects, a miniature cuckoo, having evident alliance to Indicator and to 

 Chrysococccyx, but especially to the former. The bill is pointed and curved 

 somewhat as in the larger species oi Indicator, but more slender. The plumage, 

 and especially the tail are of the same colors that prevail in this group. One 

 specimen only is in the present collection. 




15s [August 



4. IspiDTNA Lecontet, nolj'is. 



The smallest of the birds of the genera Ispidina and Corythornis, and with the 

 bill broailcr and more flat. Bill long, broad, flat, rather obtuse at the point; 

 wing moderate, third quill slightly longest ; tail very short ; legs short, weak. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) 3f inches, wing 1 8-lOths, tail 9-lOths, 

 bill i'l fiont 1, width of bill at nostrils 3-lOths inch. 



C)lr)'s. Male. Front black (without spots), crown and occiput bluish black, 

 with small spots of light blue ; back, rump and upper tail coverts light blue, 

 with a purple tinge, a narrow partially concealed collar of rufous on the neck 

 behind ; wing coverts black, with small purplish blue spots, quills bluish black, 

 edged with pale rufous on their inner webs. Tail bluish black. A small spot 

 in front of the eye ; cheeks, breast and abdomen yellowish rufous, darker on the 

 breast, throat white, under wing coverts rufous. Upper mandible brownish black, 

 point white ; under mandible at base yellow, then dark brown towards the point, 

 but at the point white ; legs yellow 



Hab. Moonda river. Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



This little bird may readily be distinguished from either of the species of 

 minute kingfishers of the genera Ispidina and Corytliornis, previously known by 

 its much broader and flat bill, which is long and quite as flat as in any species 

 of Todiramphus. The frontal feathers are clear, lustrous black to the base of the 

 upper mandible, unspotted. It is, moreover, the smallest of all those species. 



Of the two genera mentioned, all the known species are now in the collection 

 of this Academy, including Ispidina nitida, Kaup., and Coryihornis nais, Kaup. 

 The present is the only specimen that I have ever seen of this species, and is 

 not readily to be mistaken for any other. 



This curious little species is named in honor of my friend John L. Leconte, 

 M. D., one of the most distinguished and accomplished of American Zoologists 

 with whom I have had the great gratification of intimate and uninterrupted 

 friendship for years. 



5. Napothera castanea, nobis. 



About the size of iV. atricapilla of Sumatra, and somewhat resembles it. Bill 

 moderate, straight, rather wide at base, distinctly notched, curved abruptly 

 at tip, wing rather long, fourth quill longest. Tail moderate, ample, somewhat 

 rounded. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) 6| inches, wing 3 4-lOths, tail 2j inches. 



Colors. Male. Feathers of the forehead and over the eye black, each having 

 a middle longitudinal line of bright rufous. Feathers of the crown and occiput 

 at base light reddish yellow and tipped with dark rufous. Back, wing coverts 

 and rump bright reddish chestnut, darker on the rump. Lores, cheeks, sides 

 and flanks light cinereous. Throat, middle of breast and abdomen white. Under 

 tail coverts yellowish white. Bill brownish black, feet lighter. Greater wing 

 coverts with light rufous circular spots at their tips, edged with black. 



Ilab. Moonda river, "Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



This bird is, for all that I can see, an aberrant Hapothera, and in its general 

 appearance resembles -A^. atricapilla, coronata, and other species of Sumatra, 

 Borneo and Java. It appears to be the first species of this genus yet discovered 

 in Western Africa. 



6. Tricophorus calurus, nobis. 



General form of and resembling T. gularis, Horsfield, (not Swainson,) and T. 

 raniceps, both of Java and Borneo, and about the size of the latter, but smaller 

 than the former. Bill slightly curved; fifth quill longest. Tail rather long. 



Dimensions. Total length (of skin) about 7 inches, wing 3^, tail 3^ inches. 



Colors. Male. Throat white. Tail and its upper coverts rufous, the outer 

 feathers edged narrowly with greenish yellow; tail beneath lighter. 



Head above dark brownish ashy, cheeks lighter, each feather with a line of 

 white, a narrow ring of ashy white around the eye. Back, rump and wings 

 yellowish olive green, rather darkest on the wings. Under parts (except throat) 

 greenish Tellow, or nearly pure yellow in the middle of the breast and abdomen. 




1850.] 159 



and much shaded with green on the sides. Under coverts of the wings green- 

 ish yellow. Bill corneous, the margins white, tarsi light bluish. 



Female similar but smaller. 



Hub. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. This species much resembles in form and color T. ffularis, Horsfield, 

 from Java, but is much smaller and otherwise different. It also resembles T. 

 canicejjs, Lafres, (which seems to be Najwthera sulphurata, Miiller,) and is about 

 the same size. It is a very remarkable form for Western Africa. 



In color this bird appears to be similar to Dasycephala syndactyla, Swainson, 

 (which is described as 9| inches long,) but it has no syndactyle character, and is 

 much smaller. Several specimens are in the collection. 



7. Trichophorus notatus, nobis. 



Bill moderate, nearly straight ; wing with the fourth and fifth quills longest. 

 Tail rather long. 



Bhnensions. Total length (of skin) about 7^ inches, wing 3^, tail 3^ inches. 



Colors. Male. A spot of yellow in front of the eye. Entire upper parts 

 yellowish olive green, darker on the head ; wings and tail the same color as the 

 back, with the inner webs of the feathers dark reddish brown. Quills edged on 

 their inner webs with pale yellow, outer feathers of the tail with large spots of 

 pale yellow at their tips. Under parts bright yellow, tinged with green on the 

 sides. Bill corneous, edges of both mandibles white ; tarsi light colored. Un- 

 der wing coverts yellow. Female, similar but rather smaller. 



Hab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu. 



Obs. Owing to evident difiSculties in determining the species of birds which 

 have been referred to the genus Tricophorus, we have invariably declined pre- 

 senting any as new in the various African collections that have come into our 

 hands. But the two birds that we now describe are so strongly marked, that 

 we have abandoned our previous custom. 



The present bird belongs to the same group as T. canicapillus, Hartlaub, cha- 

 racterized in some measure by the bill being straighter than usual in this genus. 

 It does not, however, closely resemble that species, nor any other known to us, 

 and is strongly marked by the bright yellow spot in front of the eye, which cha- 

 racter distinguishes it at once from T. eximius, Hartlaub (Cabanis Journal, 1855. 

 p. 356), and it is much smaller. Four specimens are in the collection. 



On motion of Dr. Rand, the Academy proceeded to an election for 

 Librarian to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Dr. \V . S. 

 Zantzinper. 



The Chair appointed Dr. Brinton and Mr. Schafhirt, Tellers. The 

 election having been held, the tellers reported that Dr. J. Aitken 

 Meigs had been unanimously elected.

 Haldeman. 



Mr. Ashmead stated that, he had observed during the past summer 

 an unusual scarcity of marine algae at Beesley's Point, some species 

 usually found in shallow waters having entirely disappeared. Mr. A. 

 attributed this to the intense cold of last winter causing the shallow 

 bays and ponds to be frozen to the bottom. When the ice broke up, 

 the seaweed adhering to it would be carried away. Whole beds of 

 planted oysters were thus lost. The Heterodon Platyrhynus, generally 

 very abundant, was this year almost extinct. Dr. Leidy stated that he 

 had been informed by the fishermen, that immense numbers of crabs 

 were destroyed by the cold, so that this season they were quite scarce. 

 Mr. Haldeman had observed numbers of evergreens killed by the win- 

 ter's cold.

Dr. Leidy remarked that, he had observed the eyes of the Katy-did {Flaty- 

 phyllum concavum) which during the day are translucent and greenish, at night 

 assume a deep cherry red color. Upon experimenting with the insect he found 

 that, when the light was excluded, in the course of a few hours the eyes gradu- 

 ally became dark red, and after a restoration of light they again became trans- 

 lucent and greenish. The phenomenon was not positively explained, but it was 

 supposed to belong to the same category of changes, observed in the skin of 

 certain reptiles and cephalopoda ; /. e. the coloring matter of the eyes probably 

 is composed of chromatophora, or contractile pigment cells, which according 

 to the condition of contraction exhibit a difference in color. 



Dr. Leidy also directed the attention of the members to several shells of the 

 oyster and clam [Ostrea virginiana and Venus mercenaria) much perforated, 

 which are common on the ocean shore, where they are noticed by all visitors. 

 Dr. L. had for a long time suspected that the perforatiocs were due to some 

 other molluscous animal or a worm ; and he had frequently sought for them. 

 The last summer, in dredging, in company with Mr. Ashmead and Prof. Baird, 

 on an old oyster bed, at Great Egg Harbor, New Jersey, a large number of these 

 perforated shells were obtained, and all of them were observed to be occupied 

 by a sulphur yellow sponge of the genus Cliona. This boring sponge forms an 

 extensive system of galleries between the outer and inner layer of the shells, 

 and protrudes through the perforations of the latter tubular processes, from one 

 to two lines long and one-half to three-fourths of a line wide. The tubes are 

 of two kinds; the most numerous being cylindrical aud expanded at the orifice 

 in a corolla form, with their margin thin, translucent, entire, veined with more 

 opaque lines, and with the throat bristling with silicious spicule. The second 

 kind of tubes are comparatively few, about as one is to thirty of the other, and 

 are shorter, wider, not expanded at the orifice, and the throat unobstructed 




1856.] 163 



with spiculae. Some of the second variety of tubes are constituted of a confiu- 

 ent pair, the throat of which bifurcates at bottom. Both kinds of the tubes are 

 very slightly contractile, and under irritation may gradually assume the appear- 

 ance of superficial wart-like eminences within the perforations of the shell occu- 

 pied by the sponge. Water obtains access to the interior of the latter through 

 the more numerous tubes, and is expelled in quite active currents from the 

 wider tubes. 



In structure the sponge is composed of an intertexture of granular matter and 

 pin-like silicious spicula^. Several species of Cliona are indicated by European 

 naturalists, but are not characterised with sufficient detail to determine 

 whether the one above indicated is distinct or not from them. 



Dr. L. further added, it might appear only of scientific interest to observe a 

 structure so low as the sponge is classified in the organic kingdom, endowed 

 with the power of penetrating such dense and hard bodies as the shell of the 

 clam and oyster, but he suspected that the agency of the boring sponge was a 

 highly important one in the sequence of natural phenomena, as it is a means by 

 which dead shells are rapidly decomposed to be dissolved in the ocean water, 

 where they may again serve as the elements of construction of the habitations 

 of the rising generations of molluscous animals. In confirmation of this view 

 Dr. L. stated, that an extensive bed of oysters, which had been planted by Mr. 

 Thomas Beasley, at Great Egg Harbor, and which was in excellent condition 

 three years since, had been subsequently destroyed by an accumulation of mud. 

 The shells of the dead oysters, which were of large size and in great number, 

 in the course of two years have been so completely riddled by the boring Cliona 

 that they may be crushed with the utmost ease, whereas without the agency of 

 this sponge the dead shells might have remained in their soft, muddy bed, 

 devoid of sand and pebbles, undecomposed perhaps even for a century.

Notice of some remains of extinct Vertebrated Animals. 



By Joseph Lkidy, M. D. 



1. Leptauchenia major, Leidy. In an examination of a collection of fossils 

 obtained by Dr. F. V. Hayden, in Nebraska, for the St. Louis Academy of Science, 

 I observed the mutilated jaws of a larger species of Leptauchenia than that pre- 

 viously characterized under the name of L. decora, (Pr. A. N. S., Phila., viii. 88.) 

 In the upper jaw there are seven molars, forming nearly a continuous row, pre- 




164 [September, 



ceded by a small curved, conical caniue. The anterior three pre-moLars possess 

 a large outer lobe, and a postero-internal column, which is nearly obsolete in 

 the first of the series, and is best developed in the last. The fourth pre-molar 

 has a symmetrical pair of lobes as in ordinary ruminants. 



In a specimen of the lower jaw belonging to L. major ^ and containing several 

 true molars, there are also three pre-molars. The last of the latter had been 

 but a short time protruded. Its crown, in the general form, is like the outer 

 part in the corresponding tooth of the deer. The antepenultimate pre-molar 

 has a triliedral crown, of which the inner and posterior sides are depressed. 

 The intermediate pre-molar belonged to the temporary series, and has its crown 

 nearly worn away. The specimen of the lower jaw indicated proves that the 

 fragment of a lower jaw containing several pre-molars, the canine, and incisive 

 alveoli, previously referred to L. decora, does not belong to that genus. 



Comparative measurements of L. decora and L. major are as follows :

2. Protomertx Halli, Leidy. 



Founded upon a fragment of the lower jaw, containing alveoli for three incisors 

 to one side of the symphysis, and followed immediately by the canine. The 

 latter is small and has a laterally compressed, obtuse crown, somewhat resem- 

 bling the upper canine of the Llama. Succeeding the canine after a short in- 

 terval is the first pre-molar, with the crown broken off, but which apparently 

 had the same form as in the canine. After another interval of about one-third 

 of an iuch, there are two pre-molars, inserted by two fangs, and having a broad, 

 laterally compressed, pyramidal crown. 



The animal is most probably a ruminant, partaking of the characters of the 

 camel and the suiline families. 



Specimen obtained by Dr. F. V. Hayden, at Bear Creek, Nebraska Territory. 

 Formerly supposed to belong to Leptauchenia decora. 



The species is dedicated to Prof. James Hall, the eminent palaeontologist. 



3. Oreodon major, Leidy. 

 Ancient Fauna of Nebraska, 55. 



Having the opportunity of examining an entire skull of Oreodon major, in the 

 St. Louis collection of Nebraska fossils, obtained by Dr. Hayden, I find it is 

 really a distinct species, being characterised, not only by its larger size than 

 the other described species, but from its possessing large inflated tympanic 

 bones, which is not the case in 0. Culbertsonii and 0. gracilis. This latter cha- 

 racter might be supposed to be generic, but it is the only important anatomical 

 feature in which 0. major differs from the other species. 



Comparative measurements of the skull of the three species are as follows : 



Oreodon major, ... length 8| in. . . - breadth 5J in. 



" Culbertsonii, - - " 1\ in. - - - " ^ in. 



" gracilis - - - " 5 in. - - - " 3" in. 



4. Agriochcerus major, Leidy. 



A larger species than A. antiguvs, indicated by a single inferior true molar. 

 It is the first or second, and measures three-quarters of an inch antero-poste- 

 riorly and half an inch transversely.

5. Entelodon ingens, Leidy, 



A huge species, indicated by several mutilated canines, the anterior extremity 

 of a lower jaw without teeth, and the crown of an inferior molar tooth. The 

 chin of the fragment of a jaw is 4^ inches in depth and 5 inches in breadth at

the basal tuberosities. The crown of the lower true molar tooth is nearly an 

 inch and a half antero-posteriorly and an inch transversely. 



Specimens in the collection made in Nebraska by Dr. Hayden, for the St. Louis 

 Academy of Sciences. 



6. Pal;eoch(erus probus, Leidy. 



A species indicated by a superior first true molar, and a fragment of the lower 

 jaw with the last pre-molar and the succeeding two true molars, all of which 

 have the same form as in Palmochccrus lypus. Diameter of the superior molar 6 

 lines ; antero-posterior diameter of the second lower true molar 7 lines ; do. of 

 the last pre-molar 6 lines. 



Specimens from the collection made in Nebraska by Dr. Hayden, for the St. 

 Louis Academy of Sciences. 



7. Manatus antiquus, Leidy. 



The species is predicated on fragments of ribs found in the miocene deposits 

 of N'ew Jersey and Virginia, and on a fragment of a rib and an isolated molar 

 tooth, discovered by Capt. Bowman, U. S. A., in the sands of Ashley river. South 

 Carolina. The tooth apparently corresponds to the sixth or seventh upper 

 molar of 31. laiirostris, Harlan, than which it is considerably larger. It has no 

 anterior basal ridge, but from both of the inner lobes of the crown the summits 

 are prolonged in a curved line to the middle of the outer lobes. The specimen 

 measures in both diameters 9^ lines. 



8. Hydroch(erus J]]sopi, Leidy. 



Oromys JEsojn, Leidy. Pr. A. N. S., vii, 241. 

 Portions of two molar teeth in the collection of Capt. Bowman, from Ashley 

 river, S. C, prove that a fragment of an incisor tooth from the same locality 

 and previously referred to Oromys ^sopi, really belongs to a species of Hydro- 

 chcerus, about as large as the H. capybara of South America. 



9. CoMPSOSAURUS PRiscus, Leidy. 



The name is proposed on the remains of a saurian, obtained from the coal 

 field of Chatham Co., N. C, consisting of four teeth, which have been submitted 

 to my inspection by Dr. F. A. Genth. The teeth vary in size, are compressed 

 conical, uearly as broad as long, slightly curved, with opposed trenchant, 

 denticulate edges, constricted at the base, andapparently have been inserted by a 

 compressed cylindrical fang. The teeth are solid ; the enamel is striated ; and 

 in the larger specimens the base is longitudinally ribbed. They resemble those 

 of the lacertian Pala'osaurus from the magnesiau conglomerate of England ; but 

 in the latter genus the teeth are hollow. 



Accompanying the teeth is the specimen of a coprolite, containing a few 

 visible ganoid fish scales.

By Charles Girard, M. D. 



The fishes which are the subject of the present memoir, were collected at 

 different times and periods, by several naturalists and surgeons attached to the 

 various surveys undertaken within the five years past. 



And first of all, there is the survey of the United States and Mexican boundary, 

 from 1851 to 1855. John H. Clark, who accompanied Col. .J. D. Graham, in 1851, 

 collected extensively in the rivers and creeks of Texas and New Mexico. Under 

 Major W. H. Emory, now commissioner of the boundary line, numerous collec- 

 tions were made by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, in Texas, in the valley of the Rio Grande 

 and provinces of Chihuahua and Sonora. 



The survey of routes for a railroad to the Pacific was commenced in 1853, 




16G [September, 



and continued until 1855. Lt. A. W. "Whipple, under whose command the survey- 

 near the thirty-fifth parallel of latitude was eflfected, in securing the services of 

 Dr. C. B. Kennerly, contributed very largely to our collections of fishes from 

 Texas, and the numerous tributaries of the Arkansas River. H. B. Mollhausen, 

 artist to the same expedition, showed also much zeal and industry for collecting. 



The survey near the thirty-second parallel of latitude, western end, under Lt. 

 J. G.Parke, contributed a few specimens, collected by Dr. A. L. Heermann. 



The eastern end of the same thirty-second parallel was explored by Capt. John 

 Pope, who having attached to his party Dr. Geo. G. Shumard, interesting speci- 

 mens were obtained therefrom. 



The survey of the partial routes on the Pacific side, under Lt.R. S. Williamson, 

 Dr. A. L. Heermann being surgeon and naturalist to the party, a large collec- 

 tion of fresh water fishes, amongst which were several Cyprinoids, was made in 

 the valley of the San Joaquin River, and the Tulare Valley. 



Subsequently, the same officer explored the Sacramento Valley from San 

 Francisco, Cal., to Astoria, Or., having Dr. John S. Newberry as naturalist, who 

 secured many interesting members of the family of fishes now under considera- 

 tion. 



The survey of the route near the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth parallels, under 

 the late Capt. Gunnisson, and of the forty-first by Lt. E. G. Beckwith, secured 

 many interesting specimens from the valley of the Great Salt Lake and Hum- 

 boldt River. 



The survey of the northern route, under Gov. L 1. Stevens, was as fruitful in 

 many respects as both the United States and Mexican boundary survey, and the 

 survey of the thirty-fifth parallel. Dr. George Suckley, Dr. J. G. Cooper, and 

 Dr. John Evans, proved indefatigable in their efforts for collecting. 



The upper Missouri and Yellow Stone rivers were explored by Dr. F. V. Hay- 

 den, under the protection of Col. A. Vaughan, and thus were we made acquainted 

 with the ichthyic fauna of those remote waters. 



Lt. D. N. Couch, U. S. A., explored, iu the winter of 1852-3, the Mexican pro- 

 vinces of Tamaulipas, New-Leon, and Coahuila, thus adding materials towards 

 an elucidation of the natural history of the country south of the Rio Grande del 

 Norte (Rio Bravo) ; and but partially explored by the United States and Mexi- 

 can boundary commission. 



Valuable specimens from Platte or Nebraska river, the valley of the Great 

 Salt Lake of Utah and Humboldt river, were also received from the late J. Soule 

 Bowman. 



To John Potts, Esq., of Chihuahua, we owe some very interesting species from 

 the hydrographic basin of Chihuahua river, and the valley of Mexico. 



One species was purchased in tlie market of the city of Mexico by Major 

 Wm. Rich. 



The species formerlj' described, from tlie River Zuui, collected by Dr. Wood- 

 house, under Capt. L. Sitgreaves, are likewise included in this prodromus. 



Thus the countrj^ embraced within these surveys and fields of explorations, is 

 limited eastwardly by the valleys of the Missouri and Mississippi, and west- 

 wardly bj^ the Pacific ocean, extending from Puget Sound and the British posses- 

 sions at the North, to the valleys of the Rio Gila and Rio Grande del Norte (Rio 

 Bravo) to the South, and even including the Mexican provinces of Tamaulipas, 

 New Leon, Coahuila, Chihuahua and Sonora. 



The iuA'estigations of such an amount of materials could not be extemporised. 

 Indeed, even investigations upon tliese various collections could not have been 

 traced each separatively in the order in which they were collected. From a 

 preliminary examination of the first lot received in 1851, I became very soon im- 

 pressed with the difficulty of the task, and foresaw the utter impossibility, at 

 that time, to do anything like justice to the subject. 



In the mean time, however, a Notice upon a colleciion of fishes from the southern 

 bend of the Tennessee river, in the Slate of Alabama, by Louis Agassiz, was j)ub- 

 lished,* containing several members of the Cyprinoid family. And some time

afterwards appeared a Synopsis of the Ichthyologkal Fauna of the Pacific slope of 

 North America, chiefly from the collections made by the U. S. Expl. Exped. under the 

 command of Capt. C. Wilkes, tvith recent additions and comparisons with eastern types. 

 By the same author* 



These two papers, though anticipating some of the following results, were 

 greeted with a hearty welcome, and I can only regret that the second was not 

 concluded up to the time I am writing. I have delayed entering into this sub- 

 ject as long as was consistent with the duties imposed upon me. 



In both of them, we find the laudable desire of attempting to bring back into 

 use, the long forgotten genera of Rafinesque, which fell into disuse because of 

 their own imperfection; and if they have not passed into the common nomencla- 

 ture of the day, it was owing to their defect, more than to the partiality of 

 naturalists. For we may well imagine how anyone would feel when rebuilding 

 another's work, as little known to the author as to the commentators themselves. 



And yet, for my part, I have always looked upon the restoration of Rafinesque's 

 genera and species as highly desirable, so soon as they had once been proposed 

 and introduced into science as names. But in order to do justice to the scheme, it 

 was necessary to the undertaking that one should go to the very ground trodden 

 over by Rafinesque himself, his book in hand, during all the seasons of the year, 

 ay, even for years in succession, to enable us to discriminate between that which 

 Rafinesque really observed, and that which is imaginary. 



That the Ichthyoloyia Ohiensis has been, and still is a stumbling block, is fully 

 evinced by the fact that Dr. J. P. Kirtland, the Ohio ichthyologist, of untiring 

 and energetic zeal and perseverance, was baffled in many of his attempts to 

 determine Rafinesque's genera and species. 



These genera and species, thus restored by Prof. Agassiz, may therefore not 

 be received by all ichthj'ologistsas the final settlement of that much controverted 

 question. Be it as it may, that is : whether the identification be right or wrong, 

 since we must have these names, I sincerely hope Ihey will now be adopted, 

 once for all, as proposed. 



Since circumstances have compelled me to write this memoir before the com- 

 pletion of Agassiz's synopsis, I have restored the balance of Rafinesque's genera 

 in the family of Cyprinoids: such are Plargyrus and Semotilus. Once upon that 

 field of inquiries I reverted to Heckel's genera Argyreus and Leucosomus, and 

 shewed their claim for admission upon the same general principles and canons 

 of scientific nomenclature. 



On a former occasion the genus Leucosomus was altogether misunderstood by 

 me, and from an advice of mine it thus entered into the " History of the Fishes of 

 Massachusetts, by Dr. D. H. Storer." Prof. Agassiz was led into the same 

 error. f Heckel by inadvertence applies the name of Cyprinus chrysohucus, 

 Mitch., to Leuciscus pulchellus, Storer, as shown by the figures given of its teeth 

 and the wording of its generical diagnosis. Leucosom.us, therefore, is identical 

 with Chdlonemus, and accordiagly is the name to be adopted. Cheilonemus was 

 liroposed tor Leuciscus jmlchellus, and allied species, when it was supposed that 

 Leuciscus chrysoleucus would constitute the type of the genus Leucosomus. But 

 it is now well ascertained that Leuciscus chrysoleucus of Mitchell belongs to 

 Rafinesque's genus Luxilus ; and Luxilus has the priority over Leucosomus. 



Leuciscus gracilis of Richardson, referred by Heckel to Leucosomus, is of a dif- 

 ferent generic type. 



As to the genus Argyreus, Heckel includes in it two species generally distinct. 

 Cyprinus atronasus, Mitch., and Cypr. rubripinnis, Mus. Par. MS. But Cyprinus 

 rubripinnis is identical with Leuciscus cornutus, and since Leuciscus cornutus is to 

 enter the genus Plargyrus of Rafinesque, Cyprinus atronasus remains as the 

 type of the genus Argyreus, which again is identical with Rhinichthys. It must 

 be recollected, however, that the teeth figured by Heckel under the name of 

 Argyreus rubripinnis, are those of Plargyrus cornutus.

168 [September, 



All the species referred to in this memoir I have seen and examined ; there 

 is not a solitary fact here recorded that was not theresult of personal researches. 



On several occasions I have referred to species from the Atlantic States of the 

 Union, and even from the northern lakes, but it will be obvious to every one that 

 it was only on such occasions as could not well be omitted without sacrifice to 

 the completeness of the subject. 



I have aimed at concision, as far as consistent with the nature of the task. 

 It was deemed unnecessary to recall, ever and anon, the history of any parti- 

 cular genus, unless it happened to be intricate, for, whoever is interested in 

 the subject, is sufBciently familiar with it. It would be different were I to 

 write a popular work on our fishes. 



In the diagnosis of the genera I have often repeated characters shared by many 

 of them; these repetitions I am convinced are needful to their proper under- 

 standing. It may not appear so to a few ichthyologists; but I write 

 for naturalists, for the reader who seeks &fter general information. Besides, 

 the method I follow is the natural, the true method, that which has superseded 

 the artificial method of the last century. In describing the teeth, I have adopted 

 Heckel's phraseology, since it appears to me to answer to the present wants of 

 Ichthyology. 



The coloration, as a general rule, is described from specimens preserved in 

 alcohol, in which the brilliancy of the hues is seldom preserved, and occasionally 

 quite altered. 



In the course of these investigations I have carefully compared the fishes of 

 our hemisphere to those occurring in the waters of the eastern hemisphere ; and 

 when genera and species, either of fishes or reptiles, have, at any time, been 

 described as new, it was the result of such comparative study, shunning display 

 of loose erudition and false criticism, which too often leads into error the true 

 observer. 



I have thus added many new genera and species to the known lists. This 

 cannot be surprising ; a country so vast as North America, ii-rigated by so many 

 branching streams and large bodies of waters in the shape of lakes and numer- 

 ous ponds, a country comparatively little explored, was to yield many species 

 unknown to our predecessors in the field. A superficial knowledge of the his- 

 tory of ichthyology in North America, would at once explain how it is that a 

 "Synopsis of the Fishes of North America," published in 1846, should not have 

 proved a full and complete record of all existing fishes of the country : a synopsis 

 which, moreover, only professes to give such species as were known at that time. 

 If we are so fortunate as to be able to add to the known catalogue of genera and 

 species, let us not lose sight of both the time and the circumstances under 

 which we have accomplished it. Recriminations, in that respect, are not likely 

 to advance much our knowledge on the subject, and furthermore, it j^laccs a 

 co-temporary exactly in the same situation towards the next coming generations 

 as the former generations hold towards him. 



Most of the new genera which I propose have been designated by words taken 

 from the North American Indians, as being more euphonic than any one I 

 might have framed from the Greek. The classic literature has already furnished 

 so many names that there are but few instances in which a name might yet be 

 coined and express what it is intended to represent. I offered this remark as a 

 mere statement ; not as an apology. 



OYPRINI. 



But two genera of this group or tribe, whichever called, are included in this 

 memoir. And curious to say one is provided with a buccal barbel, and the other 

 not. The presence or absence of barbels, therefore, does not seem of- primary 

 import here. The teeth are of the molar kind (^Dentes molares), of the grinding 

 type (D. masticatorii), without grooves or ridges, and are disposed upon two 

 permanent and a third, deciduous rows: 3 2 | 5 5 | 2 | 3. The ventrals are 

 nserted in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal. 




1856.] 169 



We had a fine opportunity of studying the genus 



Mylocheilus, Agass. 



thanks to the numerous specimens collected by Lt. Trowbridge. The characters 

 of this genus are cs follows : Head elongated and sub-conical, rounded upon 

 the snout, which overlaps the lower jaw. The mouth is sub-terminal, horizontal, 

 of medium size and provided upon its angle with a maxillary barbel. The eye 

 is well developed. The isthmus rather narrow. The body is elongated, lance- 

 olated, compressed, sub-fusiform in profile. Pectoral fins slenderer than the 

 ventrals ; the latter being inserted in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal. 

 Caudal fin furcated. Scales of medium size ; lateral line following the middle of 

 the flanks. The pharyngeal bones are stoutish, expanded upon their convexity, 

 with the inferior limbs very short. The teeth are inserted upon a very much 

 incliued plan, raised from the surface of the bone itself, from below upwards. 

 They are disposed upon two permanent rows of five and two, and a third decidu- 

 ous row of three in the thickness of the gum: 3 | 2 ] 5 5 | 2 | 3. They are of 

 the molar kind of the grinding type, but without grooves and ridges. 



1. Mylocheilus lateralis, Agass. & Pick. Amer. Journ. of Sc. 2d ser. xis. 

 1855, 231. 



Our specimens are from Fort Steilacoom, Puget Sound, W. T., and were col- 

 lected by Dr. Geo. Suckley, U.^S. A., under Gov. I. I. Stevens. 



2. Mylocheilus fratsrculus, is closely allied to the preceding by the shape 

 of its pharyngeal bones, differing from it by a more slender body, much smaller 

 head and smaller eye. The color is too far gone to have anything said about it. 



From Monterey, Cal., where specimens were collected by Lt. W. P. Trow- 

 bridge, U. S. A. 



3. Mylocheilus cauriicus. Cyprinus {Leuciscus) caurimis, Rich. Faun. Bor. 

 Amer. iii. 1836, 304. Has much of the general aspect of the two preceding 

 species, more, perhaps, of 31. fraterculus than 31. lateralis. The most prominent 

 difl'erence resides in the pharyngeal bones being less expanded upon the supe- 

 rior limb, which is much more developed also. The inferior limb is also more 

 slender. The head is more elongated, more conical than in 31. lateralis, and 

 larger than in if. fraterculus. The mouth is larger than in either of the two 

 species just referred to. 



From Astoria, 0. T.; numerous specimens collected by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, 

 U. S. A. 



The genus we next introduce, and which has received the appellation of 



Mylopharodon, Ayres, 



is most closely related to 3Iylocheilus. The species which it includes are re- 

 markable for their elongated body, their sub-conical and tapering head, their 

 deeply cleft mouth, and, like the species of 3Ljlochcilus, they have the ventrals 

 inserted in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal, the caudal furcated, 

 and a narrow isthmus. But 3Iylopharodon has no barbels upon either maxil- 

 laries or the angle of the mouth. The pharyngeal bones are likewise stoutish, 

 but tlie inferior limb is more elongated than in 3Tylocheilus, though a little 

 smaller than the upper limb. We observe the same system of dentition: an ex- 

 ternal deciduous row of two or three, and two permanent rows of two and four 

 or five : 2 I 2 I 5 5 | 2 | 2, or 3 | 2 | 4 4 | 2 | 3. But the crown is much more 

 compressed than in 3Iylocheilus.

CATOSTOMI. 



What distinguishes the Catostomi as a peculiar group, consists, in the first 

 place, in the structure and position of themouth ; it is surrounded with large and 

 fleshy lips, situated under the protruding snout, and has no barbels. The 

 pharyngeal bones are sickle-shaped, varying in the curvature of the dental por- 

 tion and also in the inferior branch. The teeth are numerous, disposed upon 

 one single series ; the inferior ones being longest, the others diminishing in size 

 upwards. To use the expression of Heckel, the teeth are pectiniform {Dentes 

 pectiniformis), that is, arranged like a comb. The anterior margin of the dorsal 

 is situated in advance of the insertion of the ventrals. 



Modifications of these characters, associated with others, will furnish the means 

 of distinguishing the genera. 



The want of more materials upon which the genera Carpiodes, Ictiobus, Buba- 

 lichthys and Ci/cleptus are founded, has prevented us entering into the discus- 

 sion of their generic value. The two following species being the only ones 

 at our command, we introduce them without preamble. 



Carpiodes damalis. Ihave before me a specimen of this species measuring seven 

 inches and three-quarters in total length. The greatest depth of the body is contain- 

 ed about three times and a half in that length, whilst the head constitutes the fifth 

 part of it. The dorsal is much longer than high anteriorly ; its anterior margin 

 is nearer the end of the snout than the insertion of the caudal fin, which is pos- 

 teriorly concave. The origin of the ventrals is situated opposite the fifth de- 

 velojjed ray of the dorsal, the seventh in the series. The pectorals are small. 

 The branchiostegals are three on either side. 



D 27 ; A 10 ; C 4, 1, 8, 8, 1, 3 ; V 10 ; P 16. 



The anterior two rays, in both the dorsal and anal fins, are rudimentary, as 

 also the anterior one in the ventrals. 



The eye is sub-circular ; its diameter being contained four times aud a half 

 in the length of the side of the head. The snout is sub-conical. A line drawn 

 perpendicularly to the angle of the mouth would pass in advance of the pupil. 

 The sub-opercle is largely developed, and contrasts greatly with its reduced size 

 in C. (/.) tumidus. 



The scales are very large ; thirteen lateral rows may be counted from the an- 

 terior margin of the dorsal to the insertion of the ventrals. They are a little 

 higher than long. The lateral line undergoes a slight fall upon the thorax, 

 then runs straightway to the base of the caudal along the eighth row of scales 

 under the anterior margin of the dorsal. 



This species was collected by Dr. Geo. Suckley, U. S. A., in Milk river, an 

 affluent of the Upper Missouri, along the R. R. route explored by Gov. 1. 1. Stevens. 



We have before us half a dozen small specimens from three to three inches 

 and a half in total length, which are closely allied to the preceding species. They 

 were collected in the Arkansas river, near Fort Smith, by Dr. Geo. G. Shuraard. A 

 further identification could not be attempted. 



Ictiobus tumidus. Carpiodes tumidus, B. & G. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc, Philada., 

 vii. 1854, 28. Should all the sub-divisions of the genus Carpiodes be admitted, 

 then this species, from the Rio Grande del Norte (Rio Bravo), belongs to that 

 of Ictiobus,'^ 



The genus 



MoxosTOMA, Rafin. 



may be circumscribed by characters more natural than the preceding ones. And 

 the most striking of these, it must be conceded, is the absence of that lateral 



* There can be no question about the etymology of this name, from 1x,^!j; and 

 /iovc, which would spell ichthyobus, but Rafinesque choosed to write Ictiobus, 

 which is quite as tasteful, if not more so. The " Nomenclator Zoologicus'' must 

 have satisfied every one, that confusion alone would be the result of re-spelling 

 something like thousands of names. 




1856.] 171 



line possessed by almost all fishes. The body is elongated and compressed ; 

 the head small ; the mouth small also, opening obliquely forwards and down- 

 wards. The lips being small and trausversally ridged ; the inferior one being 

 slightly bilobed. The anterior margin of the dorsal is situated in advance of 

 the insertion of the ventrals. The dorsal fin itself is either higher than long, or 

 else its length is equal to its height, varying somewhat according to the sexes, 

 as well as the anal, which is, however, always deeper than long. The shaft of 

 the pharyngeal bones constitutes a very open curve, the convex margin of 

 which is regular and entire. The teeth themselves are very much com- 

 pressed, strongly curved inwardly, and much larger inferiorly than supe- 

 riorly. 



To this genus we add four new and very distinct species, inhabiting the 

 South Western waters. 



1. MoxosTOMA CLAViFORMis. This species has been known to us for several 

 years. Its general outline has a club-shaped appearance, a trait though more or 

 lessgenerical, is especially characteristic here. The largest specimens which we 

 have examined are four inches in total length, and in all probability not very 

 young. Thegreatestdepth,ta]ien across the pectoral region, is containedfour times 

 and a half in the total length, in which the head enters five times. The eye 

 is circular and moderate in development, contained a little over four times in 

 the length of the side of the head. The upper margin of the dorsal fin is sub- 

 convex ; its anterior margin is nearer the tip of the snout than the insertion of 

 the caudal fin. The caudal is concave posteriorly ; the anal narrow and deep ; 

 the ventrals are inserted opposite the fifth ray (or third developed one) of the 

 dorsal, and their tips do not extend as far baclc as the tips of the posterior 

 rays of the dorsal fin when bent along the dorsal line. 



D 13 ; A 10 ; C 4, 1, 8, 8, 1, 3 ; V 9 ; P 15. 



The scales are sub-elliptical in general shape, presenting no grooves upon their 

 lateral sections, but few upon the anterior section, and numerous posteriorly 

 upon that section of the scale that is exposed. 



The specimens were collected by H. B. Mollhausen, in Coal creek, a tributary 

 of the South Fork of the Canadian river j along the R. R. route explored by Lt. 

 A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



2. MoxosTOMA KENNERLii. lu its general physiognomy this species resembles 

 31. ohlongiim more than any other of its genus. The greatest deptli, taken im- 

 mediately in advance of the dorsal fin, does not enter quite four times and a half 

 in the total length. The head forms a little less than the fifth of that same 

 length. The anterior margin of the dorsal is much nearer the tip of the snout 

 than the insertion of the caudal ; the upper margin of that fin is sub-convex and 

 as long as high, whilst in M. daviformis the height is much greater than the 

 length. The caudal is deeply concave posteriorly ; the anal is deep and narrow, 

 its extremity extending, as usual in the genus, to the base of the caudal. 

 The ventrals have pretty much the same position as in the preceding spe- 

 cies. 



D 14; A 10 ; C 4, 1, 8, 8, 1, 3; V 10; P 13. 



The anterior two rays, in both the dorsal and anal fins, ai'e mei'e rudiments; 

 also the anterior one in the ventral fins. The scales are not quite so long as in 

 the preceding species. The lower lip is rather broad and very little emarginated, 

 whilst in M. daviformis it is very thin and quite sub-divided. 



This species was caught in Dry creek, near Victoria, Texas, by Dr. 0. B. 

 Kennerly, under Major W. H. Emory, U. S. Commissioner of the U. S. and Mexi- 

 can Boundary line. 



3. MoxosTOMA VICTORIA. Form elongated, fusiform, reminding us, by its 

 general appearance, of certain species of Mullet (Mi/ffil). The greatest depth is 

 nearly equal to the length of the head, which constitutes the fifth of the entire 

 length, the lobes of the caudal fin excepted. The dorsal fin is higher than long, 




172 [September, 



and its anterior margin is situated nearer the tip of the snout than the insertion 

 of the caudal fin. The latter is forked. 



D 14 ; A 10 ; C 6, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5 ; V 9 ; P 17. 



The sub-opercle is well developed ; the eye is sub-circular, its diameter being 

 contained four times and a half in the length of the side of the head. The snout 

 is rather pointed, sub-conical, and the mouth, which is small, placed entirely in 

 advance of the orbit. Twelve longitudinal rows of scales may be counted upon 

 the greatest depth. The scales upon the dorsal and lateral regions are provided 

 with a black dot or spot upon the anterior part of the exposed portion of the scale. 

 Greatest length of specimens observed, six inches and a half. 



This species was collected with the preceding, under the same circumstances 

 and in the same locality. 



4. MoxosTOMA CAMPBELLi. Sub-fusiform and clougatcd like the preceding spe- 

 cies, which it resembles in its general outline, and in the proportions of the head 

 and depth of the body towards the total length. The snout is likewise pointed and 

 sub-conical, but the eye is much larger and the sub-opercle very exiguously de- 

 veloped. The position and shape of the fins do not differ materially from the 

 preceding species, with the exception of the caudal, which is concave posteriorly 

 instead of being forked. 



D 15 ; A 10 ; C 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, r> ; V 9 ; P 15. 



The scales are smaller than in M. kennerlii ; thirteen rows instead of twelve 

 are to be observed upon the region of greatest depth. 



Specimens were collected in Live Oak creek, Texas, by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, 

 under Major Emory, and in Devil's river, by John H. Clark, under Col. Graham. 

 The species, therefore, belongs to the basin of the Rio Grande del Norte (Rio 

 Bravo). 



As regards the generic features of 



U fl TT- r^ T-T ^-^ ri m 



Ptychostomus, Agass. 



it fell within our observation that the height of the dorsal may be either equal to 

 its length or a little higher than long, and that the wing-like expansions of the 

 pharyngeals is anything but characteristic of this genus. The transverse folds 

 or ridges upon the lips are shared by Moxostoma, though in a lesser degree. The 

 inferior lip is but slightly lobed. The mouth, however, is much more protrac- 

 tile and directed more downwards. The head is short and stout ; the scales large 

 and of the same size anteriorly and posteriorly. Finally, the conspicuous 

 lateral line will at once .distinguish it from Moxostoma.

 Moxostoma. 



From the Rio Salado, Texas. John H. Clark. 



2. Ptychostomus albidus. The general physiognomy of this species reminds 

 of us P. congestus, although the body is more slender and the head more elongated. 

 The mouth is a great deal larger, as are also the scales. Greyish white above ; 

 greyish silver beneath. 



Collected by Lt. D. N. Couch, U. S. A., in the Rio San Juan, near Monterey, 

 New Leon. 



3. Ptychostomus haydeni. The head is contained five times and a half in 

 the total length. The body is sub-fusiform, very regular in its outline. The 

 eye is sub-circular and moderate in its development ; its diameter being con- 

 tained five times in the length of the side of the head. The opercle is largely 

 developed, whilst the sub-opercle is small, a character Avhich is more or less 

 generical. The anterior margin of the dorsal fin is much nearer the tip of the 

 snout than the base of the caudal. The height of that fin is a little more than 

 itslength; its upper margin is sub-concave. The caudal is forked. The origin of the 




1856.] 173 



ventrals is situated in advance of the middle of the dorsal. The tips of the 

 pectorals reach a vertical line drawn from the origin of the dorsal. 



D 15; A 10; C 4, 1, 8, 8, 1, 3 ; V 10 ; P ] 7. 



Thirteen rows of scales may be counted between the origin of the ventrals 

 and the anterior margin of the dorsal ; the lateral line running through the median 

 row. There are two rudimentary rays at the anterior margin of both the dorsal 

 and the anal, and one at the exterior margin of the ventrals ; these are all sum- 

 med up in the formula. 



Specimens of this species were collected in the Yellow Stone river, by Dr. F. 

 V. Hayden, and in the Missouri river at Fort Pierre, by Dr. John Evans. 



Now then, if the principles upon which the above generic divisions are based, 

 be sound, the species which still remain in the genus Catosiomus must be further 

 revised and arranged in smaller and more restricted groups. 



We propose to arrange under the head of 



MINOMUS, 



such species as are characterised by an elongated and fusiform body ; a head 

 longer than deep ; a dorsal fin either higher than long, or with both dimensions 

 equal. The lips laeing tuberculated, moderately bilobed. The pharyngeals not 

 expanded laterally, but considerably bent inwardly. The teeth compressed, 

 decidedly bicuspid, but the inner projection more developed than the outer. 

 The scales being nearly of the same size, but slightly smaller anteriorly than pos- 

 teriorly.

4. Catostomus (Acomus) guzmaniektsis, has the general physiognomy of A. 

 latipinnis, owing to the great development of its fins. Is, however, very readily dis- 




174 [September, 



tinguished from the latter by the presence of much larger scales, and especially 

 upon the dorsal region, where they are very small in A. latijnnnis. 



D 13 ; A t ; C 4, 1, 8, 8, 1, 4 ; V 9 ; P 17. 



The anterior two rays, in both the dorsal and anal, are rudimentary ; so also 

 the exterior one in the ventrals. 



The head forms the fifth of its total length ; the shape is subquadrangnlar, 

 subpyramidal. The eyes are small and circular. The lips are well developed 

 and covered with large papillae, but the posterior one is less indented than in 

 A. latipinnis. 



The upper regions are purplish black, with an orange lateral band from head 

 to tail. The inferior regions are yellowish white. 



Si^ecimens of this species were collected by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, under Major 

 Emory, in Janos River, which empties its water in Guzman Lake, State of Chi- 

 huahua. 



5. Catostomus ( Acomus) generosus. It is a rather short and contracted species, 

 particularly when compared to A. griseus. The head constitutes about the fifth 

 of the total length. The eye is moderate in size and circular. The anterior 

 margin of the dorsal fin is equi-distant between the tip of the snout and the in- 

 sertion of the caudal fin. The scales are larger than in A. griseus. The dorsal 

 region, as well as the flanks, are olivaceous brown, spotted with black. Inferiorly 

 unicolor. 



Specimens were collected in Cottonwood Creek, an affluent of the great Salt 

 Lake of Utah, and brought home by Lieut. E. G. Beckwith, U. S. A. 



6. Catostomus (Acomus) griseus. The body is slender, gracefully fusiform 

 iu its outline, the head forming the fifth of the entire length. The anterior 

 margin of the dorsal is equidistant between the tip of the snout and the inser- 

 tion of the caudal fin. Tlae ventrals are inserted opposite the posterior third of 

 the dorsal. The anal is slender.

 Scales exhibiting radiating furrows all around. Upper regions greyish ; infe- 

 rior regions whitish or yellowish. 



7. Catostomus (Acomus) lactarius is closely allied to the preceding species, 

 from which it differs by a stouter head and larger eyes, and larger scales on the 

 body. The structure of the scales themselves is very different, since the radi- 

 ating furrows exist upon the anterior and posterior sections only, instead of 

 being distributed all over the scale. The upper margin of the dorsal is concave, 

 whilst it is nearly straight in A. griseus.

Specimens of this species were collected in Milk River, affluent of the upper 

 Missouri, by Dr. George Suckley, under Gov. L L Stevens. 



The genus 



Catostomus, Lesu. 



=> 



would then be restricted to such species in which the head is moderately elon- 

 gated, the dorsal fin generally longer than high, and the size of the scales less 

 disproportionate anteriorly and posteriorly than in Acomus. The lips are papil- 

 lated and deeply cleft. The pharyngeals provided with a little expansion infe- 

 riorly. The teeth are compressed, with the inner projection of the crown alone 

 developed. 



The type of this group is Catostomus hudsonius. C. communis would be a 

 second species. And the following:

 Klamath Lake, 0. T. Dr. Newberry. 



5. Catostomus macrocheilus. This species is very different from both of the 

 preceding ones by a larger and more elongated head, a larger mouth, and hence 

 much larger lips, covered with large papillse. The scales which cover the body 

 are larger than in C. occidentalism and smaller than in C. labiatus. The head con- 

 stitutes the fifth of the total length ; the horizontal diameter of the eye is con- 

 tained nearly six times in the length of the side of the head. The head itself is 

 subquadrangularly pyramidal, truncated anteriorly with the upper edge of the 

 snout projecting. The anterior margin of the dorsal is a little nearer the end 

 of the snout than the insertion of the caudal fin. Its upper margin is concave. 

 The anal is well developed, for its tip extends beyond the base of the caudal. 

 The ventrals are inserted opposite the middle of the dorsal. The pectorals are 

 large and long.

6. Catostomus sucklii. The head, as usual, forms the fifth of the entire 

 length. It is subquadrangular, the upper surface rather sloping towards the 

 blunt snout. The eye is small and subelliptical ; its horizontal diameter being 

 contained somewhat over five times in the length of the side of the head. The 

 anterior margin of the dorsal fin is equidistant between the tip of the snout and 

 the insertion of the caudal. Its height is equal to its length, and its upper 

 margin is slightly concave. The posterior margin of the caudal is deeply emar- 

 ginated, crescentic. The insertion of the ventrals is a little in advance of the 

 middle of the dorsal fin. 



D 14 : A 10 ; C 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 4 ; V 10 ; P 18. 



The scales are large and but a little smaller anteriorly than posteriorly; they 

 are subelliptical in shape, longer than deep, with their anterior and posterior 

 margins irregiilar. 



Specimens of this species were collected by Dr. Geo. Suckley, under Governor 

 I. I. Stevens, in Milk River, an affluent of the upper Missouri. 



1. Catostomus bernardini. A specimen of seven inches and a half, slender 

 and graceful. The head forms a little less than the fifth of the total length. 

 The eye is large and subcircular ; its horizontal diameter entering a little over 

 four times in the length of the side of the head. The upper margin of the dorsal 

 is subconvex, the tips of the posterior rays reaching a vertical line which would 

 intersect the anus. The caudal is subcrescentic posteriorly. The ventrals and 

 pectorals are well developed.

CHONDROSTOMI. 



This group must include a much greater number of genera and species than was 

 formerly anticipated. But, as a group, it must be based upon characters very 

 different from those derived from the structure of the mouth. Indeed, those 

 cartilaginous maxillary sheathes so prominent in Chondrostoma, Chondrochylus, 

 Chondrorhynchus and Lavinia, gradually become less and less conspicuous, until 

 we find but a thin pellicle, such as occurs in other groups of the same family. 

 The characters of Chondrostomi, as derived chiefly from the American representa- 

 tives, consist in the absence of barbels ; in the position of the mouth, which is 




176 [September, 



generally overhung by the upper jaw, and sometimes both jaws are equal. The 

 pharyngeal teeth are of the grinding type and cultriform kind {Denies cullri/urjnes), 

 disposed upon a single series, with one exception only, and that occurs occa- 

 sionally in Campostoma. I say occasionallij , because in the majority of cases there 

 is also but one single row in the latter. Exoglossum is removed from this group, 

 of which it has none of the characters, except the absence of barbels. 



We introduce the tribe by the genus 



Campostoma, Agass., 



which may be characterised as follows : Head subconical ; body subfusiform ; 

 both compressed. Snout obtuse and protractile ; mouth inferior, though its 

 cleft is horizontal; lips very conspicuously developed; no barbels or cirrhi. Eyes 

 of moderate development. Isthmus very wide. Origin of ventrals situated in 

 advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal. Caudal furcated. Scales longer 

 than high. Pharyngeal bones strongly curved, with a small dilatation upon 

 their convexity. Teeth of the cultriform kind, of the grinding type, occasion- 

 ally slightly hooked. They are disposed upon a double row of four and one, in 

 the following manner: 44, or 1 | 4 4 | 1.

 Rutilus anomalus, Rafin. Ichth, Ohiens. 1820, 52. 



2. Campostoma ornatum is larger, more elongated and more fusiform than 

 C. anomalum. The^ead enters four times and a half in the total length. The 

 diameter of the eye enters nearly six times in the length of the side of the head. 

 The scales are much smaller than in C. anomalum.

 yellow, with black spots distributed over the flanks. A black patch at the base 

 of all the fins, otherwise the latter are orange or yellowish brown. 



From Chihuahua River and a tributary only a few miles long. Collected by 

 John Potts, Esq. 



3. Campostoma FORMosnLUM. This species resembles more C. anomalum than 

 C. ornatum ; the most conspicuous difference between it and the former consist 

 in the presence of larger scales. The ground color is alike, but in C.formosulum 

 black irregular spots are distributed all over the upper region of the body. 



Numerous specimens collected in the Rio Sabinal, a tributary of the Rio San 

 Antonio, Texas, by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, under "W. 11. Emory, Commissioner U. S. 

 and Mexican Boundary. 



4. Campostoma nasutum. It is a shorter and more compact species, with the 

 peduncle of the tail rather tapering. Its most prominent character consists in 

 its thick and protruding snout, which overlaps the lower jaw more than in the 

 species already referred to. The ground color is greyish above, and whitish or 

 yellowish beneath ; upper region of body and flanks occasionally marmorated. 

 A black patch at the base of the caudal and dorsal fins. 



Specimens were collected by Lieut. D. N. Couch, U. S. A., at Cadereita, and 

 near Monterey, New Leon, in April, 1853. 



From the foregoing species of moderate size, we pass to a genus composed of 

 quite small fishes, differing from the former by the position of the ventral fins, 

 which are inserted either immediately under the anterior margin of the dorsal 

 fin or posteriorly to it, never in advance, as in Camjiostoma. To designate these 

 we have selected the name of 



DIONDA. 



They are very intimately related to the Hyborhynchi, and differing from them 

 by a smaller and more pointed head, a smaller mouth, though constructed upon 

 the same plan as in Hyborynchus, that is, the lower jaw being thin, flat and 

 rounded upon its periphery. The body is more slender and elongated, the snout 




1856.] 177 



more protruding. The scales ai-e either large, or else of moderate size, and the 

 lateral line follows more or less the middle of the flanks. The dorsal fin is 

 higher than long, and shorter than in Iliihorynchus, and the anterior ray is more 

 closely united to the next. The insertion of the ventrals is always situated 

 posteriorly to the anterior margin of the dorsal, or under it, never in advance of 

 it. The caudal is treated. The pharyngeal bones are stouter than in Hyboryn- 

 chus, the lower branch or limb has the same length as tlie upper ; both are 

 more curved, thus rendering the convexity of that bone more conspicuous ; it is 

 expanded as usual. The teeth are similar to those of Hyborynchus^ being, how- 

 ever, not quite so compressed and not hooked. Four are observed upon one 

 single row : 4 4. 



This genus is closely allied to Campostoma, and since our DiondfB are, gene- 

 rally speaking, small fishes, we should not be surprised at hearing that some of 

 the species of Campostoma, while yet immature could not always be easily dis- 

 tinguished from them, for the mouth is, properly speaking, not smaller than in 

 Cainpostoma. 



The following species have fallen under our observations. 



] . DioNDA EPiscopA. Slcudcr and graceful, fusiform in profile and compressed, 

 with the back slightly arched. The head is large, forming about the fifth of 

 the length. The eye is large and subcircular, its diameter being contained three 

 times and a half in the length of the side of the head. The fins are of but mode- 

 rate development ; the insertion of the ventrals is situated a little posterior to 

 the anterior margin of the dorsal. The rays read as follows : 



D 8+2 ; A 8+2 ; C 8, 1, 9, 8, 1, 7 ; V 8 ; P 14. 



The scales are large, the lateral line following the middle of the flanks. 



The dorsal region is blackish brown ; a black vitta is observed along the flanks, 

 just above the lateral line, extending from a black spot, upon the base of the 

 caudal, to the extremity of the snout. The inferior region is yellowish white 

 spread over with minute black dots. 



Collected in the head waters of the Rio Pecos, and brought home by Capt. 

 John Pope, U. S. A. Specimens of the same species were caught by John H. 

 Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham, U. S. A., in Camanche Spring, a presumed 

 tributary of the Rio Grande del Norte (Rio Bravo), or more probably without 

 outlet. 



2. DiONDA SERENA. Could easily be mistaken for D. episcopa. Its form is 

 slender and elongated, the dorsal outline being nearly straight 5 the head enters 

 five times and a half in the total length. The eye is large and circular, its di- 

 ameter entering only three times in the length of the side of the head. The in- 

 sertion of the ventrals takes place immediately opposite the anterior margin of 

 the dorsal fin. The pectorals are long and slender, more so even than in D. 

 episcopa. 



The dorsal region is light brown, the flanks and abdomen being silvery, with 

 the scales of the lateral line dotted with black, imitating spots. A black spot 

 upon the base of the caudal fin. 



From the Rio Sabinal, Texas ; collected by Dr. 0. B. Kennerly, under W. H. 

 Emory, Commissioner U. S. and Mex. Boundary. 



3. DioNDA TEXENSis, is a vcry characteristic species. The body is rather 

 deep upon its middle, and the lateral line somewhat depressed. The head is 

 quite small and subconical, entering five times and a half in the total length. 

 The eye is large and circular. The insertion of the ventral fin is placed a little 

 posteriorly to the anterior margin of the dorsal. The dorsal region is gre3'ish 

 brown ; the abominal region greyish white ; a diffused greyish black band may 

 be observed along the middle of the flanks, embracing the lateral line beneath, 

 and a black spot upon the base of the caudal. The ventrals and pectorals are 

 yellow. 



Numerous specimens were collected in the Rio Nueces, Texas, by John H. 

 Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham, U. S. A.

4. DioNDA PAPALis. The head in this species is rather small, but rounded off 

 upon the snout ; it forms a little less than the fifth of the entire length. The 

 body is thlckish anteriorly, subcylindrical, tapering posteriorly. The dorsal 

 and anal are proportionally well developed. The caudal is forked ; the ventrals 

 are inserted under the anterior margin of the dorsal. The scales are large. The 

 coloration has been altered to a uniform black subsequently upon its immersion 

 in alcohol with sundry other specimens. 



Collected in Delaware Creek, a tributary of the Rio Pecos, and brought home 

 by Capt. John Pope, U. S. A. 



5. DioNDA ARGENTOSA, has a small head and obtuse snout, a rather slender 

 and compressed body. The head constitutes 2-llths of the total length. The 

 insertion of the ventrals is situated opposite the anterior margin of the dorsal. 

 The scales being quite large, the lateral line is slightly deflected upon the thorax. 

 Color of the dorsal region reddish brown ; sides and abdomen as if painted over 

 with silver or quicksilver. Fins olivaceous. 



Collected in San Felipe Creek and Devil's River, two tributaries of the Rio 

 Grande del Norte (Rio Bravo), by John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham,

6. DiONDA CHRYSiTis. Very slender and compressed ; head very small and 

 obtuse, contained six times in the total length. Eyes large and circular. Origin 

 of ventrals opposite the anterior margin of dorsal. Upper surface of head tuber- 

 culous. Scales large. Dorsal region reddish brown ; sides and abdomen as if 

 painted with gold. A black spot upon the base of the caudal fin. Fins them- 

 selves yellowish or olivaceous. 



Specimens were collected by John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham, U. S. A., 

 in Live Oak Creek, presumed tributary of Rio Pecos, or else losing itself into 

 the ground. 



T. DiONDA MELANOPS. A rather short and deep body characterizes this 

 species. The head is proportionally well developed, forming a little less than 

 the fifth of the total length. The snout is conical and not abruptly truncated. 

 The insertion of the ventrals is situated a little posteriorly to the anterior margin 

 of the dorsal. Scales large. The dorsal region is blackish ; the sides and abdo- 

 men are dotted with black upon a bluish lead ground, giving the whole fish a 

 dark appearance. A black spot upon the base of the caudal fin. 



From Buena Vista, Coahuila ; collected by Lieut. D. N. Couch, U. S. A. 



8. DiONDA concHi. Though closely allied to the preceding, it may readily be 

 distinguished from it by a more elongated body and more elongated head. The 

 snout is rounded. The eye is circular and of medium size. The ventrals are 

 inserted posterior to the anterior margin of the dorsal. The scales are quite 

 large. Upper regions greyish black; sides and abdomen yellowish or whitish, 

 either unicolor or maculated. A black spot upon the base of the caudal. 



Specimens collected by Lieut. D. N. Couch, U. S. A., at Guajuco, Monterey 

 and Cadereita, New Leon, in the waters of the Rio San Juan. 



9. DiONDA PLUMBEA. Bcsidcs scvcral other peculiarities of structure, this 

 species may be distinguished from all its congeners by the size of its scales, 

 which are the smallest in the genus.

 slender and elongated in body and head. The latter, however, is more conical 

 and the eye smaller, the scales being but a very little larger. Colors brownish 

 red above, whitish beneath. No spot at the base of the caudal.

The ten species that precede as well as the four following ones, are amongst 

 those whose history has most perplexed us. At last we were glad to recognize 

 the genus 



Hybortnch03, Agasa. 



established upon a species of the Ohio and its tributaries, and believed to be 

 Minnilus notattis of Rafinesquc. We have examined carefully the latter species, 

 and after a series of comparative studies we were enabled to add the following 

 few species to the genus which we thus characterize : Head rather short, upper 

 surface depressed ; snout abruptly truncated and rounded. The mouth is of 

 medium size, subterminal, its cleft being horizontal, the lower jaw flattened and 

 thin, rounded upon its periphery and slightly overlapped by the snout. There 

 are no barbels at the angles of the mouth, which do not reach a vertical line 

 drawn in advance of the orbit. The eyes are large ; the isthmus is of moderate 

 width. Anterior ray of dorsal fin shorter than the second. The insertion of 

 the ventrals is situated opposite the anterior margin of the dorsal or in advance 

 of it. The caudal is furcated. The scales are large, higher than long ; the 

 lateral line follows the middle of the flanks. The pharyngeal bones are slender, 

 and more so upon the inferior limb, which is longer than the upper and curved 

 backwards and sideways, whilst the upper limb is gently curved inwards. The 

 convexity of the same bone is expanded. The teeth are of the cultriform kind 

 of the grinding type, very much compressed, slightly hooked, and consequently 

 provided with quite a narrow grinding surface. Their disposition is upon a 

 single row of four : 4 4. 



1. Hyborhynohus perspicuus. The head is contained five times and a quarter 

 in the total length, instead of constituting the sixth part of it, as in II. nolatus. 

 The mouth and eye, both, are a good deal larger than in the latter. The inser- 

 tion of the ventrals is situated immediately under the anterior margin of the 

 dorsal. The caudal fin is more deeply furcated than in H. notatus. 



D 9+2; A 7-1-2 ; C 10, 1, 9, 8, 1, 8 ; V 9 ; P 14. 



There is a very minute rudimentary ray at the anterior margin of both the 

 dorsal and anal, followed by a second, alaout half the height of the fin. 



Upper region and flanks reddish ; abdomen sulphur yellow ; lateral line dotted 

 with greyish purple, more distinct towards the base of the caudal upon which 

 a dark spot exists. Fins yellowish, also with a black spot upon the anterior 

 margin of the dorsal below the middle height. Superior portion of the dorsal, 

 greyish, as also the external margin of the caudal. 



From Arkansas River, near Fort Smith ; collected by Dr. Geo. G. Shumardu 



2. Hybokhynchus tenellus. It is more slender and more compressed tha 

 even II. j^erspiams. The head is very much depressed, subpyramidal were the 

 snout not rounded, hence appearing quite small ; it is contained five times and 

 a half in the total length. The insertion of the ventrals is a little in advance 

 of the anterior margin of the dorsal fin. The eye and mouth are proportionally 

 large, and especially the scales, which are the largest among the hitherto known 

 species of the genus. Color uniform reddish above and on the sides ; yellow- 

 ish beneath. A black spot upon the base of caudal fin. Otherwise the fins are 

 unicolor. 



Collected twenty miles west of Choctaw Agency, by H. B. Mollhausen, under 

 Lt. A. W. Whipple. 



3 Hyborhynohus punicecs. As regards the general aspect, this species is 

 intermediate between //. perspicuus and H. tenellus. It is distinguished from 

 both of these by more developed opercular apparatus and much smaller scales. 

 The color is uniform pale red ; the fins are unicolor, yellowish. 



Specimens were collected in Antelope Creek, a tributary of the Canadian 

 River, by Dr. C. B. Ivennerly, and from Llano estacado, by H. B. Mollhausen, both 

 under Lt. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



4. Hyborhynohus confertus. This species has a short and contracted appear

ance, covered with scales a little larger than ia //. puniceus but smaller than in 

 the other species of the same genus. The opercular apparatus is likewise well 

 developed. Color light red above, yellowish beneath ; a black spot upon the 

 anterior margin of the dorsal. 



From Hurrah creek, a tributary of the Rio Pecos ; collected by H. B. M611- 

 hausen, under Lt. Whipple. 



A very remarkable genus, inhabiting our western waters, is that of 



PiMEPHALES, Rafin. 



Its body is subfusiform when seen in profile, compressed, however, as usually. 

 The head is large, short, and very blunt upon the snout. The mouth being 

 small, slightly arched, and terminal ; both jaws even. The eye is of moderate 

 development. The isthmus is proportionalh^ wide. The dorsal fin is a little higher 

 than long, provided anteriorly with a rather thick and undivided, short and hard 

 ray. The origin of the ventrals takes place either immediately opposite the 

 anterior margin of the dorsal, or else a little posterior to it. The scales are 

 rather large and the lateral line, after a slight deflection along the thorax, fol- 

 lows the middle of the flanks to the base of the caudal fin. The pharyngeal 

 bones are of moderate stoutness, gently arched, the upper and lower limb nearly 

 equal though the upper is more curved ; the convex portion is regularly dilated 

 or expanded. The teeth are of the cultriform kind of the grinding type, very 

 slightly hooked, compressed, with a narrow grinding surface, disposed upon one 

 single row of four : 4 4. 



1. PiMEPHALES MACULOSUS. It Is a stouter fish than P. promelas, both in 

 body and head. The latter is almost round. The anterior margin of the 

 dorsal is equidistant between the extremity of the snout and the last scales upon 

 the caudal fin. The origin of the ventrals is situated a little posterior to the 

 anterior margin of the dorsal. The scales are larger also than in P. prornelas. 

 Upon a yellowish brown ground there are large and iri-egular black blotches 

 covering more than half the entire surface of the body. The fins are yellow 

 upon their bases and tips, and black upon their middle. The external margin of 

 the ventrals and pectorals is pure white. 



Caught in the sluice of the Ai'kausas near Fort ilakee, and brought home by 

 Lt. E. G. Beckwith, U. S. A. 



2. PiMEPHALES FASCIATUS. This spccics has the general aspect of /*. manilosus, 

 differing, however, from it by the position of the ventrals, which are inserted 

 under the anterior margin of the dorsal fin. The scales are smaller also. The 

 color is alternately brown and black in transverse fasciae. Dorsal fin provided 

 with two black spots, one anteriorly, the other posteriorly. The other fins being 

 unicolor, with the exception of the pectorals, which are greyish upon their ex- 

 ternal margin.

 Two immature specimens of this, or a similar species, were collected in Milk 

 river. Upper Missouri, by Dr. Geo. Suckley. 



"We separate from both Pimephales and Hyhorhynckus^ under the name of 



ALGOMA, 



some small fishes, partaking in a measure of the characters of the genera just 

 mentioned. The teeth are of the cultriform kind, of the grinding type, disposed 

 upon a single row of four : 4 4. The grinding surface is nearly linear, in which 

 respect the teeth resemble more those of Pimephales than of Hyborhynchus. The 

 pharyngeal bones do not differ materially in all these genera. The head is small 

 and subtruncated, mouth small, with the lower jaw the shortest, and overlapped 

 by the upper, a feature also noticed in Hyborhynchus. The isthmus of a moder- 

 ate size ; the eye well developed. The insertion of the ventrals takes places 

 posterior to the anterior margin of the dorsal. The latter is higher than long.

without a short and thick ray anteriorly. The anal is shaped like the dorsal. 

 The caudal is furcated. The scales are very large; the lateral line, submedian 

 is slightly deflexed upon the abdomen. 



The large scales will serve to distinguish, upon a first glimpse, this genus 

 from both Hyborhynchus and PimepJiales. 



1. Algoma amara. Ten rows of scales upon the line of greatest depth, five 

 above the lateral line and four beneath it. The upper surface of the head and 

 nape is flattened as in Hydrargyra and Fundulus. Dorsal region pale red ; sides 

 silvery; abdomen whitish. 



Caught in a Laguna near Fort Brown, on the Rio Grand del Norte (Rio Bravo), 

 by John H. Clark, under W. H. Emory. 



2. Algoma pluviatilis. This species has the general aspect of a young Cam- 

 postoma and might easily be taken as such. Its mouth and eye are smaller than 

 in the preceding species. The upper lobe of the caudal is longer than the 

 lower lobe. There are also ten longitudinal rows of scales upon the line of 

 greatest depth. The upper surface of the head exhibits numerous small spines 

 as fishes sometimes have during the breeding season. Color reddish brown 

 above ; yellowish brown beneath. 



Collected near Monterey, New Leon, by Lt. D. N. Couch, U. S. A. 



And sill more curious and remarkable, is the genus 



COCHLOGNATHCS, B. & G. 



^I 



which, under the external aspect of Pimephales presents that unique peculiarity 

 in the cyprinoid family, of having spoon-shaped bony expansions of the jaws. 

 There is one on each side on the upper as well as on the lower jaw exactly as in 

 the genus Tetraodon ; their edge being sharp and cutting. The dorsal fin has the 

 structure of that of Pimephales ; the insertion of the ventrals is situated under 

 the anterior margin of the dorsal, the caudal being furcated. The scales are 

 large, and the lateral line follows the middle of the flanks. The isthmus is 

 rather Avide. The pharyngeals have the same shape and form as in Pimephales ; 

 the teeth, however, are more slender and concave upon the grinding surface, 

 giving them the appearance of being bent backwards. They are of the same 

 type, a little more conspicuously hooked, and disposed upon a single row of 

 four : 4 4.

 From Brownsville Texas ; collected by Capt. Van Vliet, U. S. A. 



Now, then, the genus 



Hybognathus, Agass. 



General form elongated, rather slender and compressed. The head is sub- 

 conical, the snout overlapj^ing the lower jaw, which is thin and flat, provided 

 upon its symphysis with a small tubercle. The mouth being small, subterminal, 

 and directed horizontally forwards ; there are no barbels upon its angles, which 

 do not reach the anterior rim of the orbit. The eyes are well developed. There 

 is a narrow isthmus. Anterior ray of dorsal longest. Insertion of ventrals 

 situated posterior to the anterior margin of the dorsal. Caudal furcated. The 

 scales are large, higher than long, and the lateral line following the middle of 

 the flanks. Pharyngeal bones very much bent, with a dilatation upon the con- 

 vexity, whilst the upper branch is bent inwards, so as to simulate a curve con- 

 cave from above. The teeth are of the cultriform kind, of the grinding 

 type, very compressed and slightly hooked, and provided with a very narrow 

 grinding surface ; they are disjjosed upon a single row of four : 4 4. 



Amongst the species of this genus which we have before us, none answers spe- 

 cifically to the description of JLnuchalis. We find every where the symphysis of 




182 -[Septfmber, 



the lower jaw rounded instead of angular, and, generally speaking, the eye rather 

 large. 



1. Hybognathus argyritis. This species seems to come nearest to H. nuchalis, 

 Agass., than any of the following ones. The eye, however, is quite large, sub- 

 circular in shape, its diameter entering a little short of four times in the length 

 of the side of the head. The snout is rather pointed, and the mouth larger than 

 in the species enumerated further below. The largest specimens observed are 

 four inches and a half in total length. The dark stripe along the dorsal line 

 does not appear conspicuously here, but may be observed, as on all the others, 

 more or less distinctly. 



We have examined specimens collected in Milk River by Dr. Geo. Suckley, 

 under Gov. I. I. Stevens, and in the Arkansas River near Fort Smith, by Dr. 

 Geo. G. Shumard. 



2. Hybognathus evansi. May easily be distinguished from the preceding by 

 a much stouter head, more protruding snout, small mouth, smaller eye. The 

 opercle is as long as deep, subquadrangular, slightly emarginated behind, as in 

 the rest of the species. 



Collected at Fort Pierre, Nebraska, by Dr. John Evans. 



3. Hybognathus placitus. The general aspect is shorter than in any of the 

 preceding species. The snout is thickish, but less so than in//, evansi; the 

 mouth smaller also. The eye is circular, its diameter being contained over four 

 times in the length of the side of the head. The scales are also larger than in 

 IT. evansi. Greyish brown above, greyish silver along the middle of the flanks, 

 and metallic white or yellow beneath. 



Collected in the sluices of the Arkansas near Fort Makee ; brought home by 

 Lieut. E. G. Beckwith^ U. S. A. 



The fish described by Dr. Ayres, under the name of Gila microlcpidota, presents 

 such peculiarly shaped pharyngeal bones, that wedid not hesitate erecting it into 

 a distinct genus under the name of 



ORTHODON, 



in allusion to the erect form of its teeth. But to proceed more systematically: 

 the head is subconical, attenuated towards the snout. The mouth is below the 

 medium size, terminal, oblique, both jaws even ; no barbels of any sort. A 

 knob or tubercle upon the symphysis of the lower jaw, as in Hybognathus. Eye 

 of medium size. Isthmus small. Body subfusiform, having the aspect of the 

 Gilse, but the ventrals are inserted under the anterior margin of the dorsal fin. 

 The caudal is furcated. The scales are small ; the lateral line submedial, being 

 somewhat depressed along the middle of the abdomen. The pharyngeal bones 

 are thin, vertically elevated, or rather broad in the vertical direction, bent as 

 usual and widening towards the upper and inner limb, so as to be broadest there. 

 The lower branch is much narrower. The teeth are of the cultriform kind of 

 the grinding type, compressed, lanceolated, erect, very slightly bent inwards. 

 They are disposed upon a single row of five, thus : 5 5, the upper ones being 

 quite raised above the edge of the bone.

The genus we next come to, and for which we have chosen the name of 



ALGANSEA, 



has features and characters altogether different from any known genus. The 

 head is subconical, more or less pointed, though rounded upon its peri- 

 phery. The mouth being of medium size, slightly oblique upwards, its angles 

 never extending beyond the anterior rim of the orbit, and destitute of barbels ; 

 the j-aws themselves terminate evenly. The eye is of moderate development. 




1856.] 183 



There is a narrow isthmus between the gill openings. The body short and 

 stoiitish, quite compressed, covered with scales of medium or of large size, the 

 lateral line being submedial, slightly deflexed upon the middle of the abdomen. 

 The fins are rather moderate in development ; the origin of the ventrals is situ- 

 ated opposite to the anterior margin of the dorsal, the posterior margin of the 

 latter never reaching the anterior margin of the anal. The caudal fin is emar- 

 ginated posteriorly. The pharyngeal bones are moderately strong ; the upper 

 and lower branches of nearly equal strength, though the lower is a little longer 

 than the upper. The convexity is strongly marked and dilated. The teeth are 

 of the cultriform kind of the grinding type, disposed upon a single row of four 

 or five, as follows : 4 4 or 5 5. The uppermost stand boldly out above the 

 surface of the bone. 



1. Algansea tincella. Leuciscus tincella, Y at., in Cuv. & FaL Hist. Nat. des 

 Poiss. xvii. 1854, 323. The scales in this species are next in size to those 

 of ^. obesa. There are about twelve rows beneath and fourteen above the late- 

 ral line. I say about, because the specimens are somewhat mutilated, as most 

 marlvet specimens are. The insertion of the ventrals are situated a little poste- 

 riorly to the anterior margin of the dorsal. The eye is smaller than in any of 

 the preceding species of this genus. Reddish brown above, silvery on the sides, 

 and white beneath. 



Purchased in the city of Mexico by Major Wm. Pdch. 



2. Algansea bicolor. Of all the species hitherto known of this genus, the 

 one here referred to has the largest scales, five rows of which may be counted 

 from the origin of the ventrals to the lateral line, and nine from the lateral line 

 to the anterior margin of the dorsal, in all fifteen rows. The ventrals are in- 

 serted a little in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal. The body is thick- 

 est auteriorl)-, and tapers backwards ; the nape is slightly swollen. The head 

 enters about four times and a half in the total length. The back and sides are 

 of a metallic bluish black, intermingled on the lower half of the flank with a 

 golden hue. The inferior surface is white, contrasting with the color of the 

 back.

 Williamson. 



3. Algansea obesa. A very corpulent species covered with scales of mode- 

 rate development, and so far, the smallest in the genus. The depth is contained 

 about three times in the length, caudal fin excluded. There are eight longitu- 

 dinal rows of scales between the origin of the ventrals and the lateral line, and 

 fourteen rows above it to the anterior margin of the dorsal, in all twenty-three 

 rows. Dorsal region bluish grey ; sides greyish ; belly yellowish. 



Specimens of this species were collected in the waters of Humboldt River by 

 the late J. Soule Bowman and Lieut. E. G. Beckwith. 



4. Algansea Formosa. A very graceful and well proportioned fish as regards 

 body and head. The latter is rather slender and conical, constituting the fourth 

 of the total length, in which the greatest depth enters nearly five times. The 

 origin of the ventrals is situated under the anterior margin of the dorsal, as in 

 A. obesa. The scales are next in size to those of A. bicolor. Seven rows are 

 found between the origin of the ventrals and the lateral line, and ten above it, 

 making eighteen rows in all. Metallic greenish brown above and on the sides, 

 minutely dotted with black ; beneath yellowish or whitish. 



This species was collected in Mercede and Mohave rivers, by Dr. A. L. Heer- 

 manu, under Lieut. R. S. Williamson, and is very closely allied to Lavinia gib- 

 bosa, Ayres, but since I have no specimens of the latter, and that those before 

 me measure but five inches and a half, I feel reluctant to attempt an identifica- 

 tion. 



Of all the genera recently established by Prof. Agassiz, there is none 

 that has given me so much difficulty to understand, as his genus Acrocheilus. 




184 [September, 



The lengthy description appended to it, reminded me very forcibly of those " spe- 

 cific descriptions referring chiefly to individual peculiarities of specimens, a kind 

 of portrait of peculiar individuals without much likeness."* After a careful 

 study of whatever specific there was in the description of Acrocheilus alutaceus, I 

 came to the conclusion that Acrocheilus was identical with 



Lavinia, 



published for the first time in 1854, nearly one year before Acrocheilus was pro- 

 posed. Circumstances of that kind are always to be regretted on eitber side. 

 The characters of the genus are as follows : The body is very much compressed, 

 deep, subfusiform in outline, covered with well developed scales ; the lateral line 

 forming an open curve, convex downwards, nearer the abdominal outline than the 

 back. The fins are well developed ; the insertion of the ventrals are situated 

 either in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal, or immediately under it. 

 The posterior margin of the dorsal approximates more or less the anterior mar- 

 gin of the anal. The caudal is deeply furcated, rounded upon its insertion, and 

 provided with numerous well-marked rudimentary rays above and below. The 

 head is rather small. The cleft of the mouth is situated altogether anteriorly to 

 the crbit ; it is of medium size, the upper jaw overlapping the lower one, which 

 is either rounded or truncated upon its symphysis. There are no buccal barbels. 

 The eye is of moderate size ; a narrow isthmus separates the gill openings. The 

 pharyngeal bones are strongly curved, the upper branch directed inwards and 

 downwards, the inferior one slightly arched backwards, with the convexity di- 

 lated. The teeth, being of the cultriform kind of the grinding type, and dis- 

 posed upon one single series of five, thus : 5 5, with a sharp terminal 

 point.

3. Lavinia haeengtjs. This species is intermediate between L. exilicauda and 

 L. alutacea. The most characteristic feature consists in the relative position 

 of the dorsal and anal fins, which are wider apart. Their size is nearly the same, 

 and if any difference should be observable, the anal would be found a little lar- 

 ger than the dorsal. The specimens before us are in a mutilated condition, inas- 

 much as the scales are all fallen. The dorsal region seems to have been of a 

 much deeper hue than the lower half of the sides, which are whitish, as well as 

 the belly, contrasting with the rather dark hue of the dorsal region.

IV. 



This fourth group is less uniform, if the teeth are taken into account. The lat- 

 ter belong to the hooked types, with or without grinding surface {Denies unci- 

 nato-submolares a,ndu7icinato-subconici), of the raptatorial [Denies raptaiori) and pre- 

 hensile {D.prehensiles), kinds chiefly; in most cases disposed upon a double series. 

 But all its representatives are provided with buccal or maxillary barbels. In 

 the species from the Pacific range a thin cartilaginous pellicle is observed upon 

 the jaws : illustrating what we had already remarked, that the cartilaginous lips 

 are not sufficient to characterise the group of Chondrostomi. Of course, it is in 

 the latter where that character assumes its greatest developement. 



*Amer. Journ. of Sc. 2d. ser. xix. 1855, 220 




1856.] 185 



We begin the group with the genus 



Argyreus, Heck. 



which is the exact synonym of Agassiz's Rhinichthys. And we are not a little sur- 

 prised at seing the learned Professor bring forward his generical appellation,* 

 introduced into the nomenclature in 1850, in preference to that of Heckel insti- 

 tuted in 1840, especially when elsewhere he appears so eager at restoring all 

 such names as have the priority of publication, and which is nothing but just. 

 The natural characters of the genus Argyreus, are : " A snout more or less 

 protruding beyond the lower jaw, thus giving the mouth an inferior position." 

 In that respect it resembles Cainpostoma and similar Chondrostomi. " The mouth 

 itself is rather small, surrounded with quite narrow and smooth lips," covered 

 with a deciduous cartilaginous pellicle in the western species, "and provided 

 upon its angle with a small barbel, sometimes very conspicuous." The gill open- 

 ings are separated beneath by a very wide isthmus. The insertion of the ven- 

 trals is situated in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal fin, which is 

 higher than long. The caudal is furcated. The scales are small. The pharyn- 

 geal bones are quite narrow, and stouter above than below. The teeth are of 

 the hooked type without grinding surface, strongly hooked and disposed thus : 

 1 I 4 4 I 2, that is, upon two rows, four in the outer row, and one or two in the 

 inner row.

To which we add, as new : 



6. Argyreus dulcis. It has the snout more prominent than .4. aironasus,a.n6. 

 less so than A. 'nasutus. The head is well developed, constituting the fourth of 

 the length, the caudal fin excluded. The eye is quite small and subcircular, its 

 horizontal diameter entering six times in the length of the side of the head, a 

 little over twice in advance of its anterior rim. The mouth is larger than in most 

 of its congeners, and the barbel much more conspicuous. The dorsal fin, as usual, 

 is higher than long, but its upper margin is slightly convex. Its anterior 

 margin is nearer the extremity of the snout than to the insertion of the caudal 

 fin. The latter constitutes a little less than the fifth of the entire length. The 

 anal is a little shorter than the dorsal, but not as deep as the latter is high.

The dorsal region is greyish yellow ; the sides yellowish, with an indistinct 

 silvery band ; beneath yellowish white. The dorsal region, including the upper 

 part of the flanks, is spread over with black specks, sometimes observed beneath 

 the silvery band also. 



Specimens, the largest of which measuring about three inches and a half, 

 were collected by the late J. S. Bowman, in the Sweet Water, a tributary stream

of Nebraska, or Platte Eirer. Smaller specimens of the same species were ob- 

 tained in Cottonwood Creek, Utah, by Lieut. E. G. Beckwith, U. S. A. 



Y. Argykeus nubilus. This is a very characteristic species. The head is 

 very small, and the body, fusiform in shape and compressed, is thick and swol- 

 len upon its middle. The tail again is rather slender. The snout is subcorneal, 

 but not more protruding than in the preceding species ; the mouth is a great 

 deal smaller than in the latter, with its barbels less conspicuous. The head 

 constitutes about the fifth of the entire length. The eye is moderately developed 

 and subcircular in shape ; its horizontal diameter is contained about five times 

 in the length of the side of the head. The dorsal, caudal and anal fins are of but 

 moderate development, the pectorals and ventrals rather small. 



D 8+2 ; A 7-f 2 ; C 5, 1, 9, 8, 1, 6 ; V 8 ; P 12. 



The number of rays in the fins does not materiallj^ differ from that of the pre- 

 ceding species ; in both, the anterior two rays of the dorsal and anal fins are 

 mere rudiments. 



The color above is blackish brown, with a purplish hue along the middle of 

 the flanks ; the inferior regions are of a soiled white or yellowish brown. The 

 upper surface of the head and upper half of the sides, including the eye, is deep 

 black ; inferiorly it is whitish or yellowish white. 



Specimens, four inches in total length, were collected at Fort Steilacoom, Puget 

 Sound, W. T., by Dr. Geo. Suckley, U. S. A., under Gov, I. I. Stevens. 



8. Argyreus osculus. Has more the fascies of ^4. atronams than of any other 

 of its congeners, both by the outline of its body and head, and the shape and 

 position of the mouth. The head is comparatively small, forming the fifth of 

 the length, with the exception of the lobes of the caudal. The eye is rather large 

 and subcircular, its diameter entering about four times in the length of the side 

 of the head. The dorsal and anal fins are well developed, the former being 

 convex superiorly, and the latter subconvex exteriorly. The posterior margin 

 of the caudal is crescentic. The posterior extremity of the ventrals extend as 

 far as the vent, which is not the case in the two species described above. 



D 8-1-2 ; A '7-{-2 ; C 5, 1, 9, 8, 1, 6 ; V 8 ; P 14. 



The anterior two rays of both the dorsal and anal fins are mere rudiments, as 

 already stated. 



The color is reddish brown above ; olivaceous on the sides, with numerous 

 dark blotches and dots. Beneath uniform yellowish white or silvery white. 



Many specimens, the largest of which measuring less than three inches, were 

 collected by John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham, U. S. A., in the Baboco- 

 mori, a tributary stream of the Rio San Pedro, itself flowing into the Rio Gila. 



9. Argyreus notabilis. This species resembles A. osculus in many respects, 

 but will always be easily distinguished from it by a more truncated snout, and 

 consequently by a mouth not so deeply cleft. The dorsal fin is situated more 

 anteriorly also. The scales are smallei-. The ground color is yellowish or brownish 

 above, golden or orange beneath, covered all over, the abdominal region ex- 

 cepted, with small black spots. 



Specimens caught in the Rio Santa Crux, Sonora, by John H. Clark, under 

 Col. J. D. Graham, U. S. A. 



The hydrographic basin of the Rio Gila harbors a generic type which, at first 

 sight, one would refer to Argyreus ; but on a closer inspection, its generic traits 

 will appear quite conspicuous. The name of 



AGOSIA 



is proposed for it ; the diagnosis is as follows : Snout rounded, slightly pro- 

 truding beyond the lower jaw, though the mouth opens horizontally. The 

 mouth is of medium size, surrounded with narrow and smooth lips, and pro- 

 vided upon its angle with a very small barbel. The isthmus is of moderate 

 width. The insertion of ventrals is situated opposite the anterior margin of dorsal 

 fin, which is higher than long. The caudal is bifurcated. The scales are minute- 




1856.] 187 



The pliaryngeal bones are expanded upon their curvature. The teeth are of the 

 prehensile li^ind of the hooked tj'pe, provided with a grinding surface ; strongly 

 hooked, and disposed thus : 4 4, that is, upon one single row of four. 



Now, comparing the above with the characters assigned to Argyreus^ we find 

 that the most prominent difference resides in the pharyngeal teeth. The isth- 

 mus is narrower, and the insertion of the ventrals placed further back. 



1. Agosia chrysogater, is about three inches and a half in total length, the 

 head forming a little more than the fifth of it. The posterior extremity of the 

 maxillary extends to the vertical line of the anterior rim of the orbit. The eye 

 is large and circular, its diameter being contained about four times in the length 

 of the side of the head. The anterior margin of the dorsal is a little nearer the 

 end of the snout than the insertion of the caudal. The following is the formula of 

 the fins : 



D 10 ; A 7 ; C 4, 1, 9, 8, 5, ; V 9 ; P 16. 



A minute rudiment at the anterior margin of both the dorsal and the anal fins 

 are not included in the above numbers. 



The region above the middle of the flanks is reddish brown, spotted or dotted 

 with black, especially upon the head ; a black vitta separates this region from 

 that beneath, which is unicolor of a golden hue. 



The species was collected in the Rio Santa Crux, Sonora, by John H. Clark, 

 under Col. J. D. Graham. 



2. Agosia metallica. The specimens of this species are a little shorter than 

 those of the preceding one. It is very characteristic, and easily distinguished 

 from its congener. The head is shorter and the snout more abruptly rounded. 

 The eye is smaller also. The body is more gracefully subfusiform and com- 

 pressed. The dorsal is higher and narrower, rounded superiorly. The posterior 

 margin of the caudal is crescentic, less furcated than in A. chrysogaster. 



The formula of the fin's rays present also some difference: 



D 9 ; A 8 ; C 4, 1, 9, 8, 1, 5 ; V 8 ; P 15. 



The same is true with regard to the rudiment at the anterior margin of the 

 dorsal and anal, and which must be sought for under the skin. 



Upper regions greyish brown dotted with black ; inferiorly silvery and uni- 

 color ; a black vitta on the sides separating the two hues.

 Pedro, an afiluent of the Rio Gila. 



The genus which we have formerly characterized under the name of 



POGONICHTHYS, 



although enlarged by the accession of a new species, stand within the same 

 limits as were originally assigned to it. The body is fusiform and elongated, 

 compressed, covered with large and uniform scales, and provided with a con- 

 spicuous lateral line deflexed upon the middle of the abdomen. The dorsal fin 

 is higher than long ; the ventrals are inserted in advance of the anterior margin 

 of the dorsal. The caudal is bifurcated. The head is of moderate size or else 

 small, either rounded or flattened upon its upper surface. The snout being 

 more or less protruding beyond the lower jaw, the mouth assumes a somewhat 

 inferior position, although opening horizontally forwards. The mouth itself is 

 of medium size, provided upon its angle with a barbel inserted upon the ante- 

 rior edge of the posterior extremity of the maxillary. The eye is of moderate 

 development. The isthmus is quite narrow. The pharyngeal bones are pro- 

 portionally stout, the inferior limb being, however, slender, slightly arched and 

 expanded upon its symphysis. About tlie height of the third tooth the con- 

 vexity suddenly expands, tapering off towards the extremity of the upper branch, 

 which is slightlj'' bent inwardly downwards. The teeth are well developed, very 

 much compressed upwards and hooked. They are of the prehensile kind, of 

 the hooked type, with a grinding surface, somewhat inclined backwards, and 

 disposed upon a double row of two and four : 2 | 4 4 | 2. 




188 [September, 



This genus is intimately related to Leucosomtis, differing from it chiefly, by 

 the structure of its teeth, which are provided with a grinding surface in Pogo- 

 nichthys, whilst there is a sharp edge in Leucosomus.

 U. S. A. 



4. PoGONiCHTHYS COMMUNIS. This spccies is the most characteristic of the 

 genus, by its small and flattened head and the large scales which cover the 

 body. The mouth is larger in proportion than in any of its congeners ; in large 

 specimens the snout overlaps entirely the lower jaw, in which respect it resem- 

 bles Gila elegans most remarkably. The barbel upon the angle of the mouth is 

 very conspicuous. The fins are all well developed ; the external rays of the 

 pectorals extend beyond the usual termination of these fins in other species. 

 The dorsal region is reddish grey or greyish red, according to circumstances ; 

 the rest of the body whitish yellow or yellowish golden, the fins being unicolor. 



"We have examined numerous specimens of this species. They were collected 

 at Fort Pierre, Nebr., by Dr. John Evans ; at Fort Union, by E. J. Denig ; above 

 Fort Union and in Milk River, by Dr. Geo. Suckley, under Gov. I. I. Stevens ; in 

 the Yellowstone River, by Dr. F. V. Hayden, and in the Sweet Water, a tributary 

 of Platte or Nebraska River, by the late J. Soule Bowman. 



The genus of genuine Gudgeons, 



GoBio, Cuv. 



is a type that may easily be characterized. Head subconical, with the snout 

 rather thick and obtuse, overlapping the lower jaw, thus giving the mouth a 

 somewhat inferior position. The latter, however, is directed forwards ; it is 

 large, and provided with a well developed barbel upon the posterior extremity 

 of the maxillary. The eye is of moderate development. The isthmus is large. 

 The body is elongated, subcylindrical. The dorsal and anal, both, are rather 

 narrow fins. The insertion of the ventrals takes place under the anterior margin 

 of the dorsal or a little behind it. The caudal is bifurcated. The scales are large 

 and the lateral line nearly median. The pharyngeals are gracefully curved, the 

 upper and lower branches tapering, the convexity very slightly expanded. The 

 teeth are slender, subcylindrical upon their base, compressed above, of the rap- 

 tatorial kind of the hooked type, without grinding surface, and disposed 

 upon a double series of one, two or three, and three, four or five, as follows : 

 3 I 55 I 2, or 2 | 44 | 1, &c. &c. 



This genus may be distinguished from Leucosomus by its protruding snout, 

 much more developed maxillary barbel, and narrow dorsal and anal fins, and 

 finally its pharyngeal teeth more strongly hooked. 



1. GoBio GELIDU8. Body and head very slender and elongated; head forming 

 about the fifth of the total length. The snout is quite prominently developed. 

 The eye is rather small compared to G. Jiuvialilk, resembling more, in that re- 

 spect, G. cataractce, from which, however, this species can readily be distin- 

 guished by the position of its ventral fins, which are inserted under the anterior 

 margin of the dorsal, whilst they are placed in advance of it in G. cataractce.

Color yellowish brown, lighter beneath than above, with a silvery streak along 

 the middle of the flank. 



Specimens of this species were collected in Milk River, an affluent of the 

 upper Missouri, by Dr. Geo. Suckley, under Gov. I. I. Stevens. 



2. GoBio AESTIVALIS. This is quite a characteristic species, differing from all 

 its congeners by a rather compressed body, elevated and arched upon its middle, 

 and taperingsrapidly along the peduncle of the tail. The snout is miich shorter 

 and less obtuse than in G. gelidus ; the eye is larger also, and the position of 

 the ventrals a little more forwards. The scales are larger, too. In coloration 

 we see no marked difference between this species and G. gelidus. 



Caught in the Rio San Juan, near Cadereita, New Leon, by Lieut. D. N. Couch, 

 U. S. A. 



3. GoBio VERNALis. The body is fusiform, thickest anteriorly, tapering pos- 

 teriorly. The head is short, the snout blunt and rounded. The eye is large, 

 its diameter being contained three times and a half in the length of the side of 

 the head. Tlie caudal fin is long and deeply furcated ; it constitutes nearly the 

 fourth of the entire length, whilst the head enters in the latter nearly five times 

 and a half. The color is uniform yellowish brown, with a silvery streak along 

 the middle of the flanks. The opercular apparatus and cheek are highly silvery. 



From Arkansas River, near Fort Smith ; collected by Dr. Geo. G. Shumard. 



Under the head of Luzilus will be found the reasons for transferring the name 

 of 



Leucosomus, Heck. 



to Leuciscits pulchelhcs, instead of Ci/prinus chrysoleiicus. We shall now charac- 

 terize this genus, as it is, henceforth, to stand in the ichthyic system. The body 

 is elongated, subfusiform, compressed. The head is stout, conical, either ab- 

 ruptly truncated or tapering oil'. In either case, the mouth is large, subterminal, 

 and the upper jaw slightly protruding beyond the lower. A small barbel upon 

 the maxillary, near the angle of the mouth. Eyes of medium size. Insertion of 

 ventrals a little in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal, or immediately 

 under it. Caudal bifurcated. Scales large, a little longer than high ; lateral line 

 following the middle of the flanks. Pharyngeal bones stoutish, sickle-shaped ; 

 the inferior branch rather slender, the convexity having a slight expansion 

 tapering off towards the tip of the upper branch. The teeth are subconical, 

 compressed and strongly hooked, of the raptatorial kind, of the hooked type, 

 without grinding surface. They are disposed upon a double row of four and 

 two in the following manner : 2 | 4 4 ] 2 ; sometimes 2 | 5 4 | 3, and even 

 1 I 44 I 2. 



The genus Cheiloncmus, Bd., is strictly synonymous with iewcoso?K?/; the latter 

 differs from Semotilus by the presence of maxillary barbels.

Lake Huron and Lake Superior. 



3. Leucosomus dissimilis. This species will be easilj' recognized by the small 

 size of the scales of the back compared to those of the flanks. In that respect 

 it approximates species of the genus Semotilus. Its head is subconical, contained 

 a little less than four times in the total length. The eye is large, its diameter 

 being contained four times in the length of the side of the head. The color is 




190 [September, 



uniform greyish brown above, silvery along the middle of the flank and yellow- 

 ish beneath. 



Speo'mens of this species were collected by Dr. Geo. Suckley, under Gov. I. I. 

 Stevens, in Milk and Little Muddy rivers, tributaries of the upper Missouri. 



4. Leucosomus pallidus. This species has the same general physiognomy as 

 L. dissimilis. The scales of the back are likewise a great deal smaller than on 

 the flanks, but in totum they are larger than in the preceding species. The origin 

 of the ventrals is situated in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal, a 

 feature that will enable us at once to discriminate between this species and L. 

 dissimilis. The dorsal region is greyish brown, the ventral region yellowish 

 white. A black spot at the base of the caudal, as well as upon the anterior 

 margin of the dorsal. 



Specimens were collected in Antelope Creek, Arkansas, by Dr. C. B. Ivcnnerly, 

 under Lieut. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



5. Leucosomus incrassatus. Remarkable for its stout and short body and 

 well developed head, which constitutes a little more than the fourth of the total 

 length. The scales are proportionally smaller than in L. pallidus. Dark greyish 

 above, light greyish beneath, with a yellowish hue all over the head and body. 

 A black spot upon the anterior margin of the dorsal ; none upon the caudal. 



Collected twenty miles west of Choctaw Agency, by H. B. Mollhausen, under 

 Lieut. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



The following genus, for which the name of , 



NOCOMIS 



is thought well appropriated, has a short, stoutish and compressed body? 

 covered with large scales. The ventrals are inserted opposite the anterior mar- 

 gin of the dorsal, mayhap a little anterior to it. The caudal is furcated. The 

 head is large, rounded upon the snout, which is declivous. The mouth is large 

 and terminal, the lower jaw being slightly overlapped by the upper. A barbel 

 upon the posterior extremity of the maxillary. Eyes small. Isthmus rather 

 wide. The pharyngeals are stoutish, somewhat expanded upon their convexity ; 

 expansion tapering off towards the tip of the upper limb, which is gently curved 

 inwards. The inferior limb is scarcely longer than the upper, looks more slender, 

 is flattened upon its extremity, which is turned outwards, causing a convexity 

 inwardly. The teeth are of "the voratorial kind of the hooked type, without 

 grinding surface. They are subcylindrical, acerated and hooked, disposed upon 

 a double series of one and four, in the following manner : 1 | 4 4 | 1. 



This genus is allied to Semodhis by its pharyngeal teeth, diifering chiefly by 

 its mouth, which is not so deeply cleft, and by its maxillary barbels, which are 

 absent in Scmotilus. 



NocoMis NEBRACENSis. It is a fish about four inches in total length, of a 

 uniform reddish brown hue above, and golden yellow beneath ; a blackish 

 streak along the middle of the flanks terminating into a black spot upon the 

 base of the caudal fin. The lateral line is nearly medial, being but slightly de- 

 pressed along the thoracic region. 



Collected in the Sweet Water, a tributary of Platte or Nebraska River, by the 

 late J. Soule Bowman. 



The genera brought together in this paragraph are numerous, and quite 

 as varied in their dentition as in the former group. They differ from the latter 

 by the absence of barbels. As in the preceding, the teeth are of the hooked 

 types, Avith or Ayithout grinding surface (^Denies uncinato-submolares et uncinato- 

 subconici), mostly of the raptatorial kind. In the majority of cases, the teeth 

 are disposed upon a double scries also. 



This and the former group ought to be subdivided in a natural method, which 

 is not our object now. Moreover, a thorough grouping of the American Cypri- 




1856.] 191 



noids cannot yet be attempted with any sort of satisfaction, as long so the 

 eastern representatives are not all revised. 



The most curious genus, it must be conceded, is that of 



ExoGLOSSUM, Rafin. 



The body is elongated, subcylindrical, slightly compressed. The head is sub- 

 conical, flattened upon the occiput, and terminated by a blunt snout. The 

 mouth is subterminal, opening downwards and forwards, the lower jaw being 

 shorter than the upper and not surrounded by the lips around its symphysis, 

 the lips being largely developed at the angle of the mouth and along the upper 

 jaw also. The eye is of moderate size. The isthmus is wide. The origin of 

 the ventrals is situated opposite the anterior margin of the dorsal. The caudal 

 is bifurcated. The scales are of medium size, nearly quadrilateral. The pharyn- 

 geal bones are exiguous, very slender upon their inferior branch, hardly dilated 

 above. The teeth are of the raptatorial kind of the hooked type, without grind- 

 ing surface, instead of which a sharp, but not crenated, edge. They are dis- 

 posed vipon a double row of one and four, thus : 1 | 4 4 | 1.

2. Exoglossum mirabile. A very characteristic species, very slender and 

 fusiform, and distinguished from the preceding by a smaller head, smaller 

 mouth, the position a little more backwards of the ventrals, and larger scales. 

 The color is reddish brown above, light reddish beneath, with a silvery band 

 along the middle of the flanks from head to tail. A black spot upon the inser- 

 tion of the caudal fin. 



Caught in the Arkansas River, near Fort Smith, by Dr. Geo. G. Shumard. 



Along with young specimens of Gila grahami, caught in the San Pedro, were 

 numerous little fishes from two and a half inches to three inches long, which, 

 upon a superficial examination, might not have been distinguished from their 

 associates just mentioned, for the fact of the absence of scales could not have 

 given them an aspect very different from the young Gil^e, since the latter have 

 very minute scales in their immature state. A careful comparison between the 

 two sets of specimens very soon revealed generic characters so peculiar, that we 

 had to institute, under the name of 



MEDA, 



a genus widely different from all other American cyprinoids, by the presence, 

 upon the anterior margin of the dorsal, of a stout undivided (though articulated) 

 ray, resembliog in its general appearance that which is observed in Barbus, Lu- 

 cioharbus, Scaphiodon and Systomus, differing, however, from all of these in the 

 structure of its posterior edge, which is grooved instead of being serrated. The 

 absence of buccal barbels in 3lda, is another feature to warrant its claims as 

 a genus, which differs from Cyprinus^ Carassius, Carpio, &c., by characters equally 

 obvious, as will be seen by the following diagnosis : 



Body elongated, slender, compressed, fusiform in its profile, and perfectly 

 naked. The lateral line may be traced along the middle of the flanks, slightly 

 deflexed upon the abdomen. The head is elongated, subconical, rounded upon 

 the snout without being truncated. The mouth is proportionally large, subter- 

 minal, its cleft slightly oblique upwards, the lower jaw fitting into the upper. 

 No barbels. The eye large and circular. The isthmus narrow. Dorsal fin 

 higher than long, provided anteriorly with a stout, articulated but simple and 

 osseous ray grooved posteriorly and nearly as high as the second ray, which ia 




192 [September, 



slightly higher, and the highest of all. The veatrals are inserted in advance of 

 the anterior margin of the dorsal, and adherent to the ventral line for more than 

 the half of their total length. The caudal is deeply furcated. The pharyngeal 

 bones are slender, especially upon their inferior limbs, which are longer than 

 the upper ones. The latter are flattened or expanded, and curved inwardly 

 downwards. The teeth are very slender, subconical, compressed at their base, 

 of the prehensile kind of the hooked type, without grinding surface. They are 

 disposed upon a double series of one and four: 1 | 4 4 | 1. Thus, equally dis- 

 tinct from both Phoxinus and Phozinellus, to which this genus bears an external 

 resemblance. 



Thus far we are acquainted with but one species. 



Mbda fuloida. The head constitutes a little more than the fifth of the total 

 length. The angle of the mouth is even with a vertical line drawn in advance 

 of the orbit. The dorsal region is reddish yellow; the middle of the flanks as 

 if painted with silver; underneath pale yellow. 



From Rio San Pedro, tributary of the Gila ; collected by John H. Clark, under 

 Col. Graham, U. S. A. 



We now bring here together, under the name of 



CLIOLA, 



some species of small cyprinoids, having the external aspect of Dionda^ but 

 difl'ering from the latter by the pharyngeal teeth, which are curved, and without 

 grinding surface. The snout is rounded, the mouth small and terminal, with 

 both jaws equal. There is a rather wide isthmus. The eyes are well developed, 

 also. The dorsal fin is about as long as high, or longer than high. The caudal 

 fin is bifurcated; the insertion of the ventrals, opposite the anterior margin of 

 the dorsal. The scales being large, and the lateral line following the middle of 

 the flanks. The pharyngeal bones are of moderate strength ; the inferior branch 

 is rather slender, and nearly straight when viewed in front; from the insertion 

 of the teeth, they gradually expand to the entire convexity which is gentle and 

 gradual. The teeth themselves are of the raptatorial kind, of the hooked type, 

 without grinding surface, compressed, curved, and disposed upon one single row 

 of four: 4 4.

2. Cliloa velox. A very slender and elegant species, differing from C. viffi- 

 lax, by a more conical head, much larger eyes, and larger scales. A black 

 spot may be observed upon the anterior margin of the dorsal fin. The ground 

 color is olivaceous, with the middle of the flanks silvery; a black vitta follows 

 the course of the lateral line. A black spot exists also upon the base of the 

 caudal fin. 



Specimens were collected by Dr. C. B. Kennedy, under Major W. H. Emory, 

 in the San Pedro creek, a tributary of the Rio San Antonio, Texas. 



3. Cliola vivax. This species might easily be mistaken for O. velox, were it 

 not for the shortness of its head and its small eye. Besides, the body is not so 

 much elongated, and is covered with scales a great deal smaller. The color is 

 uniform light yellowish or saffron, with a black spot upon the base of the caudal 

 fin, and another upon the anterior margin of the dorsal ; the middle of the 

 flanks exhibits traces of a greyish or blackish vitta.

Amongst the few genera which seem to be common to both hemispheres, there 

 is the genus 



Alburnus, Rond. 



which we find distributed over a large portion of our continent. But, in order 

 to include the American species in that genus, the diagnosis is to be slightly 

 modified, so as to read : Raptatorial teeth disposed upon a double row of two and 

 four or five, thus: 2 | 5 5 | 2 or 2 | 4 4 | 2. la all the species which I have 

 examined, the teeth are disposed according to the second formula. 



The teeth themselves are slender and compressed, more or less hooked. The 

 pharyngeal bones are slender, expanded upon their convexity, the upper limb 

 bent inwards and downwards, and the inferior limb rather exiguus and shorter 

 than the upper. Should the American species, now referred to this genus, prove 

 generically distinct upon a more minute comparison, which we cannot now estab- 

 lish, the name of Alburnellus might unite them under a new generic appella- 

 tion. 



1. Alburnus dilectus, is about three inches and a half in total length ; the 

 head forming a little less than the sixth part of it. The greatest depth is nearly 

 equal to the length of the head. The diameter of the circular eye is contained 

 a little more than three times in the length of the side of the head, and less 

 than once in advance of its anterior rim. There are ten longitudinal rows of 

 scales between the insertion of the ventrals and the base of the dorsal. The 

 lateral line is upon the fourth row from the ventrals upwards. The color is 

 uniform yellowish red with a lateral silvery streak. 



Collected in the Arkansas river near Fort Smith, by Dr. Geo. G. Shumard. 



2.^Alburntjs umbratilis, is a shorter and deeper species, and which migh* 

 easily be taken for a Lnxilus, so striking is its general resemblance with smal^ 

 specimens of the latter genus. The greatest length is about three inches ; the 

 greatest depth being equal to the length of the head, and contained five times 

 in the total length. The lateral line, though running along the fourth row of 

 scales from the insertion of the ventrals, is more deflexed upon the abdomen 

 than in A. dilectus; the longitudinal rows of scales being fourteen in number. 

 The ground color is silvery grey above; the back, sides and fins as if shaded ; 

 the belly reddish. 



Specimens were collected, by H. Miillhausen, in Sugar Loaf Creek, a tributary 

 to Poteau river, flowing into the Arkansas near Fort Smith. 



3. Alburnus amabilis This is a very slender and graceful species, about 

 two inches and a half in total length. The head constitutes the fifth of the 

 length, and the greatest depth, the sixth. There are nine longitudinal rows of 

 scales upon the flanks, between the insertion of the ventral fins and the dorsal 

 line. The lateral line, as usual, is found along the fourth row from the ventrals 

 upwards. The color is dark reddish brown, silvery upon the flanks. A black 

 patch upon the base of the tail. 



Specimens were collected in the Rio Leona, an affluent of the Rio Nueces, by 

 John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham, U. S. A. 



4. Alburnus meqalops. Resembles A. amabilis in general traits, being slender 

 and graceful, but easily distinguished from it by a shorter and more rounded 

 snout and a larger eye. The coloration is the same with the exception of the 

 black caudal patch, which does not exist here. The average size of the speci- 

 mens before us is about two inches. 



Caught in San Felipe Creek, Texas, by John H. Clark, under Col. Graham. 



5. Alburntts socius. Resembles A. mcgalops by its snout and eye. The total 

 length is two inches and a half, the head forming the fifth part of it. The greatest 

 depth is a little less than the length of the head. The dorsal region is oliva- 

 ceous, the flanks silvery, and the belly yellowish. Opercular apparatus golden. 



Specimens of this species were collected in Live Oak Creek, Texas, by John 

 H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham, U. S. A.

194 [September, 



There are yet other species which bear a striliing external resemblance to 

 Alburnus, or better AlLurnellus, but differing by an ensemble of characters, which 

 have led us to establish, under the name of 



ALBURNOPS, 



a genus to include them. They may be distinguished by their smaller mouth and 

 by a thickening of the snout, which slightly overlaps the lower jaw, contrary to 

 what is the case in Alburnus and Alburnellus. In that respect, Alburnops will 

 remind us some species of Ihjborhynchus. The eye is large ; a very narrow 

 isthmus separates the gill apertures beneath. The insertion of the ventrals 

 talies place under the anterior margin of the dorsal fin, which resembles that of 

 Alburnus and Alburnellus. 



In both of the latter genera, the ventrals are situated in advance of the dorsal. 

 The caudal is furcated. On the other hand, the anal has a narrower base than 

 in Alburnus and Alburfiellus ; the lateral line is nearly medial, instead of being 

 deflexed upon the abdomen. The scales are large and deciduous. The pharyn- 

 geal bones resemble, by their configuration, those of Alburnellus. The teeth 

 themselves, are of the prehensile kind of the hooked type, with a narrow and 

 sometimes contorted grinding surface. They are disposed upon a double row of 

 two and four : 2 | 4-4 | 2, or 1 | 44 | 2. 



Thus we see that a marked difference between Alburnops and Alburnus s. Al- 

 burnellus, consists in the presence of a grinding surface in the former, and which 

 is absent in the latter. 



1. Alburnops elennius. This species has the snout most prominently 

 rounded. The posterior extremity of the maxillary extends to a vertical line 

 drawn across the anterior rim of the orbit. The eye is smaller than in the two 

 following species. The greatest length being about three inches and a half, the 

 head forming the fifth part of it ; the depth is less than the length of the 

 head. Theie are ten longitudinal rows of scales upon the greatest depth, six 

 above the lateral line and three below it. The color is reddish brown ; the 

 middle of the flanks, silvery ; the fins unicolor. 



Specimens collected iu the Arkansas river, near Fort Smith, by Dr. Geo. G. 

 Shumard. 



2. Alburnops suumardi. The snout is more conical than in the preceding 

 species, the mouth larger and more deeply cleft. The head constitutes, likewise, 

 the fifth of the total length, which measures three inches and a half. There are 

 but nine rows of scales, five above and three below the lateral line. Color red- 

 dish brown ; flanks silvery. 



Collected by Dr. Geo. C. Shumard, in the Arkansas river, near Fort Smith. 



3. Alburnops illecebrosus. Perhaps the most graceful of the three species 

 so far known of this genus. The number of rows of scales is ten, as in A. 

 blennius. The snout less prominent than in A. slnmiardi, and more so than in 

 A. blennius. The eyes are the largest in the genus. The head is contained five 

 times and a half in the total length, which averages about three inches. Color 

 reddish brown ; flanks silvery.

Under the name of 



CODOMA, 



we arrange small cyprinoids, characterized by a short head and rounded snout, 

 terminated by a small mouth, the cleft of which does not reach a vertical line 

 drawn in front of the orbit; there being no barbels at its angle, and both jaws 

 even. The isthmus is of moderate width. The body is more or less elongated, 

 compressed. The insertion of the ventrals is situated in advance of the anterior 

 margin of the dorsal. The caudal is bifurcated, and like the rest of the fins, rather 




1856.] 195 



small. The scales are of medium size, higher than long, and the lateral line is 

 but slightly deflesed upon the thoracic region. The pharyngeals are moderately 

 expanded upon their convexity. The teeth are of the raptatorial kind, of the 

 hooked type, compressed, without grinding surface, instead of which, a sharp, 

 but not serrated ridge. They are arranged upon one single row of four, thus : 

 44. 



The general physiognomy of the genus reminds us of that of Pimcphales and 

 Cochlognalhus, with which genera it has no intimate affinities, when the pharyn- 

 geal dentition is taken into consideration. Indeed, its affinities with Cyprinella 

 and Moniana are of a more close character, for the teeth are constructed according 

 to the same general pattern ; from Cifprinella, however, it differs by the presence 

 of one single row of teeth, and from Moniana by the absence of serratures upon 

 the cutting edge of the teeth, and finally from both Cyprindla and 3Ioniana by 

 smaller scales, the course of the lateral line, and the short and rounded head. 



1. CoDOMA ORNATA. This species has the aspect of Pimpephales promdas to a 

 much higher degree than the following. The head forms the fifth of the total 

 length, whilst the greatest depth enters in the latter but three times and a half. 

 The eye is circular and well developed ; its diameter entering a little over three 

 times in the length of the side of the head. The anterior margin of the dorsal 

 is a little nearer the extremity of the snout that to the insertion of the caudal 

 fin. 



D 8 +1 ; A 7 + 1 ; C 6, 1, 9, 8, 1, 6 ; V 7 ; P 12. 



The coloration is rich and profuse, the upper regions are purplish black, with 

 transverse bands of the same hue along the flanks to the base of the caudal fin ; 

 the space not occupied by these, on the back as well as on the abdomen, is of 

 a golden red. The fins are purplish black, edged or tipped with golden yellow 

 or pure white. 



Inhabits Chihuahua river and its tributaries ; collected by John Potts, Esq. 



2. CoDOMA viTTATA. Has a more elongated body and subfusiform outline 

 than the preceding species. The head forms a little less than the fifth of the 

 entire length, whilst the depth enters in it about four times and a half. The eye 

 is much smaller than in C. ornaia; the fins and scales are smaller, also. 



D8 + 1; A7+2; C7, 1, 9, 8, 1, 6; V7; P14. 



The upper regions are purplish brown ; a silvery band along the middle of the 

 flank; inferiorly yellowish orange. Fins unicolor ; the superior ones greyish, 

 the inferior yellowish. 



Collected in the valley of Mexico, by John Potts, Esq. 



Since Rafinesque's genera are to be restored, Ms genus 



Plargyrus, 



is to take the precedence over the genus Hypsolepis of more modern coining. The 

 name of Plargyrus was provided for in the Ichthyologia ohiensis, to replace that 

 of Ruidics in the eventuality that Cyprinus riUilus of Europe, which was the type 

 of the genus Ruiilus, should prove generically distinct from Rutilus plargyrus and 

 similar American species, and which is the case. _ 



The genus Plargyrus includes the prettiest species of American Cyprinoids. 

 Their comparatively small size, compressed and graceful body, subfusiform m 

 its profile, added to brilliant and vivid colors, have brought these fishes to the 

 notice of the multitude. They are commonly known as " Red Dace," " Silver- 

 side Fall-fish," " White and Yellow-winged Shiner," " Shiner," &c. 



Its generic traits may be thus expressed : Head large and subconical ; mouth 

 terminal more or less oblique upwards. Jaws equals. No cirrhi or barbels. 

 Eyes large. Isthmus quite narrow. Tail tapering. Caudal fin bifurcated or 

 forked The insertion of the ventrals is situated opposite the anterior margin 




196 [September, 



of dorsal fin, or a little behind it. Dorsal and anal Ens without strongs and un- 

 divided ray anterior!}'. Scales very large, imbricated, much higher than long. 

 Lateral line forming a downward curve beneath the middle of the flanks. Pha- 

 ryngeal bones rather slender with an angular expansion at the upper portion of 

 the descending branch, the expansion itself tapering away towards the upper 

 and inner extremity. The teeth are compressed, of the prehensible kind, of the 

 hooked type, very slightly hooked, provided with a grinding surface ; being dis- 

 posed upon a double row as follow: 2 | 4 4 | 2. 



The teeth of this genus are figured by Heckel, under the name of Argyreus 

 ruhrijyinnis, the second species of his genus Argyreus, and which is nothing else 

 but Plargyrus cornutus in a breeding dress. 



The species are : 



1 Plargyrus cornutus. Cyprinus cornutus, Mitch. See Siorcr^s Fishes of 

 Mass. in Mem. Amer. Acad. v. New Ser. 1855, 118, where this species is figured

6. Plargyrus. BOWMANi. We inscribe this species to the memory of one, who, 

 under difficulties of various sorts, during a travel across the continent, thought 

 it not of little importance to collect and preserve specimens of natural his- 

 tory, which he forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution. The species is grace- 

 fully subfusiform in its profile, the depth in advance of the dorsal being equal 

 to the fifth of the entire length, in which the head itself enters about four times and 

 a half The eye is very large ; its diameter being contained a little less than 

 four times in the length of the side of the head. Dorsal region reddish brown ; 

 sides silvery, abdomen yellowish. A black streak along the flanks and above 

 the lateral line. 



A specimen, four inches in total length was caught in the Sweet water, a 

 tributary of Platte or Nebraska river, by the late J. Soule Bowman. 



Had the name of ITypsolepis not been made synonymous of Plargyrus, we 

 might have applied it with perfect propriety to the group which we now call 



CYPRINELLA, 



since the fishes therein included, possess that curious character of scales higher 

 than long. They replace in the South-west, the Plargyri of more northern 

 climes. Though generally smaller than the species of Plargyrus, some do re- 

 semble the latter in a very striking manner, whilst others are much shorter and 

 deeper in proportion. The chief differences between the present genus and 

 Plargyrus, is to be found in the pharyngeal teeth and the position of the ventrals. 

 To Jfoniana it bears more striking resemblances and real aflSnities. The 

 position of the ventral fins is the same, the pharyngeal bones are alike also, the 

 teeth are of the same general pattern, but disposed upon a double series in Cypri- 

 nella, and upon one only in iVoniana. Besides, in Cypri?iclla, the snout generally 

 protrudes beyond the lower jaw, though the mouth is slightly oblique and sub- 

 terminal. But let us formulate the generic characters of the genus we are now 

 treating of: Body very compressed, either elongated and subfusiform, or else 

 with the dorsal and abdominal outlines rather arched, but which may, after all. 




1856.] 197 



simply indicate the female sex at the breeding season. The head is of moderate 

 size, subconical, the snout generally protruding beyond the lower jaw. The 

 mouth is small, slightly oblique and subterminal.' No barbels of any sort. Eyes 

 moderate. Isthmus narrow. Tail tapering, caudal fin bifurcated. Insertion of 

 ventrals opposite or slightly in advance of the anterior margin of dorsal fin. 

 Scales of moderate development, imbricated, much higher than long. Lateral 

 line forming a downwards curve beneath the middle of the flanks. Pharyngeal 

 bones like those of Plnrgyrus. The teeth are slender and compressed, of the 

 raptatorial kind of the hooked type, slightly hooked, without grinding surface, 

 instead of which, a sharp ridge inconspicuously creaated, and disposed upon a 

 double row of four and one, in the following manner, 1 | 4 4 | 1. 



We know already several species of this genus, besides one formerly described 

 and with which we commence the list. 



1. Cyprinella bubalina. Leuciscus bubalinus, B. & G., in Marci/s Expl. of Red 

 Riv. of La. 1853, 249. Zool. PI. xiv. figs. 5 8. It is one of those species, the 

 dorsal outline of which is very much arched. 



From Otter Creek, a tributary to the northern fork of Red River, Ark. 



2. Cyprinella umbrosa. Also a deep bodied species, much larger than 

 the preceding, indeed the largest of the species hitherto known of its 

 genus. The ventral outline as much arched as that of the back. The greatest 

 depth, taken at the anterior margin of the dorsal, is equal to the third of the 

 length, the caudal fin excluded. The entire length measures about three inches 

 and a quarter, the caudal fin being a little less than the greatest depth. The 

 nape is a little depressed ; the head constitutes the fourth of the length, caudal 

 fin excluded. The eye is circular, its diameter entering a little over three times 

 in the length of side of the head. The anterior margin of the dorsal is nearer the 

 tip of the snout than the insertion of the caudal. The insertion of the ventrals 

 is a little in advance the anterior margin of the dorsal. 



D 8 4- 2 ; A 9 + 2 ; 3, 1, 9, 8, 1, 4 ; V 8 ; P 14. 



Greyish red above; greyish white beneath. Fins unicolor. 



Specimens were caught by H. B. MoUhausen, under Lt. Whipple, in Coal 

 creek, a tribatary to the southern fork of the Canadian river, Ark., and also 

 twenty miles west of the Choctaw Agency. 



3. Cyprinella gdnnisoni. The body is short but not so deep as in the pre- 

 ceding species. The head is smaller than in C. umbrosa, but the eye preserves 

 the same proportions. A characteristic feature may be found in the scales which 

 show a greater portion of their surface, though equally as high. Color reddish 

 brown, dark above and light beneath. 



Collected in Cottonwood creek, a tributary of the Great Salt Lake of Utah, 

 and brought home by Lt. E. G. Beckwith, U. S. A. 



4. Cyprinella beckwithi. A species allied to the preceding by its external 

 form and general appearance, but readily distinguished from it by a larger head, 

 and larger scales also. The latter one likewise larger than in C. umbrosa. Color 

 greyish brown above, orange red beneath ; fins unicolor. 



From the sluices of the Arkansas river near Fort Makee ; brought home by Lt. 

 E. G. Beckwith, U. S. A. 



5. Cyprinella suavis. This species establishes the transition between the 

 deep and slender species. The head forms about the fifth, and the depth the 

 fourth of the total length. Yellowish red above, and yellowish white beneath 

 with a silvery hue. 



Collected near San Antonio, Texas, by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, under Lt. A. W. 

 Whipple, U. S. A. 



6. Cyprinella LEPiDA. Elongated and fusiform; the greatest depth taken 

 upon the anterior third of the body, being contained four times and a half in the 

 total length ; the head forming a little less than the fourth of the same length. The 




198 [September, 



head, therefore, is well developed; the eye is circular, its diameter being con- 

 tained four times in the length of the side of the head. The scales are larger 

 than in any of its hitherto known congeners. Light reddish above, pale sulphur 

 yellow beneath. 



Caught in the Rio Frio, a tributary to the Rio Nueces, Texas, by Dr. C. B. 

 Kennedy, under Lt. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



8. Cyprinella notata. Also an elongated and fusiform species, but easily 

 distinguished from C. lejnda, by a shorter head, less furcated caudal, and, 

 especially, by smaller scales ; the latter differing also in their general outline and 

 radiating furrows. Reddish above; yellowish beneath, with a jet black patch 

 upon the base of the caudal fin. 



Collected in the Rio Seco, a tributary to the Rio Nueces, Texas, by Dr. C. B. 

 Kennerly, under Lt. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



8. Cyprinella whipplii. Gracefully elongated and subfusiform. Dorsal 

 region slightly arched upon the insertion of the fin. Greatest depth forming a 

 little more than the fifth of the total length, whilst the head, which is subconi- 

 cal, constitutes a little less than the fifth of the same dimension. The eye is 

 quite large, larger than in any other species of the same genus, since its diameter 

 enters but a little over three times in the length of the side of head. Another 

 very characteristic feature is to be found in a very high dorsal fin, rounded upon 

 its upper margin. The origin of the ventral fins is situated opposite the anterior 

 margin of the dorsal. The scales are of moderate development, and the 

 lateral line is but slightly flexed downwards. Reddish brown above ; golden 

 yellow beneath ; a black patch upon the posterior margin of the dorsal. 



Caught in the Sugar Loaf creek, a tributary of Poteau river, itself empty- 

 ing its waters into the Arkansas river, near Fort Smith, Ark., by H. B. M611- 

 hausen, under Lt. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



9. Cyprinella macrostoma. This species is very characteristic. The body 

 is deep upon its middle, tapering posteriorly. The head is subconical, with a 

 prominent snout and a very large mouth. The eye is well developed. The ven- 

 trals are inserted a little in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal fin. Red ; 

 silvery upon the opercular apparatus and middle of the sides. 



Specimens were collected in Devil's River, Texas, by John H. Clark, 

 under Col. J. D. Graham, and at China, New Leon, by Lt. D. N. Couch, U. S. A. 



10. Cyprinella venusta. Gracefully compressed and fusiform in profile. The 

 snout protruding and subconical. The species is related to C. macrostoma, from 

 which it chiefly diifers by the relative size of its mouth and shape of the body. 

 The ventrals are likewise inserted a little in advance of the anterior margin of the 

 dorsal. Greyish red above, pale beneath ; sides silvery. A black patch upon 

 the base of the caudal fin. 



Numerous specimens were collected in the Rio Sabinal, Texas, by Dr. C. B. 

 Kennerly, under Major W. H. Emory. 



11. Cyprinella texana. Body very slender and fusiform ; head small and 

 subconical; mouth small; eje large. Ventrals inserted under the anterior 

 margin of the dorsal. Color reddish brown, sides silvery; lateral line accom- 

 panied by black dots terminating into a black spot upon the base of the caudal. 



From Rio Salado, Texas, and Turkey creek, Texas, collecteii by John H. Clark, 

 under Col. J. D. Graham. 



12. Cyprinella luxiloides At first, this species would remind us of cer- 

 tain species of Liixilus in its general appearance. The body being deep, 

 gradually tapering away forwards and backwards. The head is well developed, 

 and the mouth also. Ventrals inserted slightly in advance of the dorsal. Red- 

 dish brown above: silvery beneath. 



From San Pedro creek, Texas, collected by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, under Major 

 W. H. Emory. 




1856.] 199 



13. Cyprinella lugubris. Elongated, fasiform ; head large and mouth ac- 

 cordingly, though the latter is smaller than in C. macrostoma. The ventrals are 

 inserted under the anterior margin of the dorsal. Dark brown above, silyery 

 upon the sides and under the belly. 



The locality were this species was collected is not precisely known. It was 

 brought borne by Lt. E. G. Beckwith. 



14. Cyprinella ludibunda. All the specimens of this species which we have 

 examined are immature, and yet there is no doubt in our mind as to its specific 

 difference from all the species hereto alluded to. The head is small and conical, 

 with the snout round and truncated. The mouth being small. The ventrals 

 inserted in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal. Color reddish brown ; 

 middle of sides silvery; lateral line marked with black dots. 



Associated with the preceding, and collected under the same circumstances. 



"We next introduce a genus composed of small species, all being provided with 

 scales similar in general outline, to those of both Plargyrus and Cyprinella : we 

 call it 



MONTANA. 



Its species truly replace the Plargyri in a more southern latitude under a 

 diminutive aspect. As regards structure, they differ widely from Plargijrus, as 

 will appear by the following diagnosis : Body compressed, subfusiform. Head 

 rather small, subconical or rounded. Snout occasionally protruding slightly. 

 Mouth suboblique, terminal ; both jaws generally equal. No barbels. Isthmus 

 narrow. Eyes moderate. Caudal fin bifurcated. These characters, so far, are 

 found in Plargyrus. But now for the differences. The insertion ofthe ventrals is 

 situated in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal, which is higher than 

 long. The pharyngeal teeth are compressed, of the raptatorial kind, of the 

 hooked type, without grinding surface, instead of which, a sharp ridge is observed, 

 very minutely crenated. They are disposed upon a single row of four, thus : 

 44. 



Besides a species previously described, there are several new ones to be placed 

 on record. 



1. Montana lutrensis Leitcisms lutrensis, B, & G. in Marcy^s Expl. of Eed 

 Riv. of La. 1853, 251. Zool. PI. xiv. figs. 912. 



From Otter creek, tributary of the northern fork of Red River, Ark. It was 

 also caught in Gypsum creek, a tributary of the false Washita River, by H. B. 

 MoUhausen, under Lt. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



2. Montana lecnina. The largest of the hitherto known species of the genus. 

 The entire length measures three inches and a quarter, the head forming the 

 fourth of it, the caudal fin excluded. The body is very deep upon its middle, 

 where the greatest depth is a little less than the fourth of the entire length. The 

 mouth is proportionally small. The eye being circular, its diameter entering four 

 times in the length of the side of the head. The rays are : 



D9 + 2;A10 + 2; 5,1,9,8,1,7; V9; P 16. 



Greyish brown above; white or dull yellowish beneath. 



Specimens were collected in Leon River, a tributary to the Rio San Antonio, 

 Texas, by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, under Lt. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



3. Montana deliciosa. This is one of the most slender of all the species 

 hitherto known of the genus. Its length is a little over two inches and a half, 

 the head forming the fifth part of it. The latter is proportionally small, sub- 

 conical anteriorly. The eye is quite large and circular, its diameter en- 

 tering about three times in the length of the side of the head. There are ten 

 longitudinal rows of scales upon the greatest depth of the body ; the scales them- 




200 [September, 



selves are large. The color is reddish brown above, silvery along the middle 

 of the flanks and yellowish beneath. 



Specimens of this species were collected in Leon River, a tributary of the 

 Rio San Antonio, by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, under Lieut. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



4. MoNiANA PROSERPINA, is remarkable for its slender body, subconical head, 

 and very small mouth. The eye is of moderate development. The total length 

 is two inches and a quarter, the head constituting the fifih part of it. Eleven rows 

 of scales may be counted upon the line of greatest depth of the body. Greyish 

 brown above ; metallic greyish white upon the sides and beneath. 



From Devil's River, Texas ; collected by John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Gra- 

 ham, U. S. A. 



5. MoxiANA AURATA. A most haudsome species, with a rather deep body 

 gradually tapering posteriorly, and a rounded and subtruncated head bearing 

 minute spines upon its upper surface. The eye is proportionally small, and the 

 mouth of medium size. Chesnut brown above; a diffused blackish streak along 

 the middle of the flanks; golden beneath. 



From Piedra Painie, New Mexico ; collected by John H, Clark, under Col. J. D. 

 Graham. 



6. MoNiANA coMPLANATA. The most compresscd of all the species so far known. 

 The profile is regular ; the peduncl'e of the tail rather slender. The total length 

 is two inches and a half, the head entering in it five times and a half. The 

 mouth and eye are of but moderate size. Scales large and very deciduous. Pale 

 red above, silvery upon the sides and yellowish beneath. 



Collected at Brownsville, Texas, by Capt, Van Vliet, U. S. A. 



7. MoNiANA L,T.TABiLis. The body is subelliptical in profile, the tail slender. 

 The head well developed, being contained four times and a half in the total 

 length, which measures about two inches. The greatest depth is equal to the 

 length of the head. The fins are quite conspicuously developed; the scales 

 large, as usual in the genus, being also deciduous. Reddish brown above, yel- 

 lowish white beneath ; sides silvery. 



Specimens collected by H. B. MoUhausen, under Lieut. W. A. Whipple, in 

 Hurah Creek, a tributary of the Rio Pecos, of the Rio Grande del Norte (Rio 

 Bravo). 



8. MoNiANA PULCHELLA. Allied to M. lutrensis. but differing from it by a shorter 

 snout and a more compact tail. The eye is large also. A distinctive feature 

 between the two species is to be found in the squamation, since the scales are 

 more deeply imbricated in 31. lutrensis than in M. jjalchclla. The color is reddish 

 brown ; silvery upon the sides. 



Caught by H. B. Mollhausen, under Lieut. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A., in the 

 Sugar Loaf Creek, emptying its waters into the Poteau River, itself a tributary 

 of the Arkansas, near Fort Smith. 



9 MoNiANA PRiGiDA. This species is a little more than three inches in total 

 length, and stands next to the largest of the hitherto known species. The head 

 forms about the fifth of the length. The body is rather deep and very much 

 compressed ; the caudal fin deeply forked. The eye is circular, and its diameter 

 contained four times in the length of side of the head. 



The rays of the fins are, 



D 84-2; A 8 + 2: C G, 1, 9, 8, 1, G; V 8 ; P 13. 



The color is of a reddish brown above, silvery white beneath. The middle of 

 the flanks exhibits an indistinct or rather diffused silvery band, sometimes 

 blackish. 



Specimens of this species were collected by John II. Clark, under Col. J. D. 

 Graham, U. S. A., in the Rio Salado, Rio Sabinal and Rio Medina, all three 

 tributaries to the Rio S.in Antonio, and in the Rio Nueces also. It was likewise 

 caught in the Rio Frio, a tributary of the Nueces by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, under 

 Lieut. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 




1856.] 201 



10. MoNiANA coucHi, resembles M. gracilis most ; is, however, distinguished 

 from it by a less fusiform body and a much shorter head. This feature may be 

 traced upon series of specimens of both species with an unfailing constancy. 

 The eye is smaller also, and so is the mouth as might be deduced from the cha- 

 racters just alluded to. 



From the vicinity of China, New Leon, Mexico ; collected by Lieut. Couch, 

 U. S. A. 



11. MosiANA RUTiLA, has the general physiognomy of M. gracilis, from which it 

 differs by a more advanced position of the dorsal fin and larger scales. Dorsal 

 region greyish ; sides and abdomen golden. 



From Cadereita, New Leon, Mex. ; collected by Lieiit. D. N. Couch, U. S. A. 



12. MoNiANA NiTiDA. This spBcies differs from JI.eouchi by a more elongated 

 and fusiform body, more elongated head and much larger eye. From M. rutila 

 it differs by the same characters of the body, but the head differs by the flatten- 

 ing of its upper surface. There are eleven longitudinal rows of scales upon the 

 line of greatest depth of the body, five above and five below the lateral line. 

 The latter, therefore, is nearly medial, forming but a slight curve upon the 

 middle of the abdomen. Color pale red, sides of head and middle of the flanks 

 silvery. 



Collected at Cadereita, New Leon, by Lieut. D. N. Couch, U. S. A. 



13. Montana Formosa. The prettiest species of the genus ; the body is ellipsoid 

 in profile and the tail very much tapering. The region above the lateral line is 

 blackish brown in the adult, and reddish brown in the young, occasionally also 

 dotted with black ; the inferior regions are reddish yellow anteriorly and yel- 

 lowish red posteriorly. 



Numerous specimens of this species were collected in the Eio Mimbres, Mex. 



14. MoNiANA GRACILIS. A Very graceful and slender species, resembling most 

 J/, lulrensis, from which it however differs by a much smaller head and a more 

 arched back ; the body itself is more compact. Ash grey above, yellowish white 

 beneath ; flanks silvery. 



Specimens were collected near Monterey, New Leon, by Lieut. Couch, U. S. A. 



15. Montana gibbosa. May readily be distinguished from all its congeners by 

 a short and arched body, resembling a cyprinodon as much as any fish we might 

 compare it to. Pale reddish above, whitish beneath ; sides silvery. 



Specimens collected ai Brownsville, Texas, by Capt. Van Vliet, U. S. A. 



16. MoNiANA TRisTis. A slender and graceful species, subfusiform in profile, 

 though the back is rather arched. The peduncle of the tail is long and of 

 nearly uniform depth. The head constitutes about the fifth of the length. Eleven 

 rows of scales, five above, five below the lateral line. Reddish brown. 



Brought home by Lieut. E. G. Beckwith, U. S. A. 



The " Fauna Boreali Americana " records under the name of Cyprinus (Abra- 

 nis,) baltcaius, a species of this family, which bears a strong external resemblance 

 to the large species of Luxilus, and so much so, that, on a superficial examina- 

 tion, no one would hesitate to refer it to the latter genus. The structure of the 

 pharyngeal teeth affords the most striking generic differences, as will be seen 

 further on. In selecting for it the name of 



RICHARDSONIUS, 



we have borne in mind the eminent labors of the author of the work just referred 

 to. We will characterize the genus by saying, that the body is very compressed, 

 subelliptical or fusiform in its outline and deep upon its middle. The head is 

 proportionally small ; the mouth terminal, slightly oblique, constructed as in 

 Luxilus, but somewhat larger, yet unprovided with cirrhi or barbels. The eye 

 is large. Isthmus very narrow. Caudal fin forked ; insertion of ventrals situ- 

 ated in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal. Anal fin longer than the 




202 [September, 



dorsal, and its anterior margin situated anteriorly to the posterior margin of the 

 base of the dorsal, in which respects it differs from Luxilus. The pharyngeal 

 bones are narrow, with a slight expansion upon their convexity ; the teeth being 

 of the raptatorial kind of the hooked type, strongly hooked, without grinding 

 surface, instead of which a sharp but not crenated ridge. They are disposed 

 upon a double row of four or five and two, as follows : 2 | 4 4 | 3, or 2 | 5 

 5 I 2. 



The present genus bears some resemblance to Squalius, from which it may 

 be distinguished by the smooth edge of the dental ridge and the long anal, with 

 its peculiar position in reference to the dorsal. The scales are also smaller and 

 much deeper than long, which is not the case in Squalius.

The specimens before us were collected at Fort Vancouver and Fort Dalles, 

 Columbia River, by Geo. Suckley, under Gov. I. I. Stevens. 



2. RiCHARDSONius LATERALIS, is more of an elongated and fusiform aspect than 

 R. balteatus. The head is contained four limes and a half in the total length. 

 The pharyngeal teeth are five upon the outer row, instead of four. Dorsal region 

 blackish brown ; lower part of sides and abdomen silvery; upper part of sides 

 provided with a black band extending from head to tail. 



Specimens procured at Fort Steilacoom, Paget Sound, "W. T., by Dr. Geo. 

 Suckley, U. S. A., under Gov. I. I. Stevens. 



We adopt the genus 



Luxilus, Rafin. 



To include such species as are congenerical with Leuciscus chrysoleucus of 

 Mitchill, and Luxilus chrysocephalus of Rafinesque. .It is one of the most 

 characteristic genus of North American cyprinoid, and altogether misunder- 

 stood by Heckel ; for, Cyjmnus chrysoleucus^ Mitch., which he places in his 

 genus Lcucosomus, is generally distinct from Lmciscus imlchellus of Storer, as 

 I have had the opportunity to ascertain. The diagnosis given to Leucosomus by its 

 author, and the figures representing the pharyngeal dentition, leave no room for 

 doubt. Leucoso7nus, therefore, is not synonymous with Luxilus, but was really es- 

 tablished upon a species most intimately related to the one yet unpublished, and 

 which is the type of the genus CheiJoncmus. The latter, therefore, must give 

 way to Lcucosomus, a circumstance unavoidable and very much to be regretted, 

 for it complicates the synonymy of both Luxilus and Leucosomus. 



We characterize as follows the genus Luxilus: " Body very much compressed, 

 flattened laterally, and deepest upon the middle of its length. Head propor- 

 tionally small and compressed like the body. Mouth small, terminal, unpro- 

 vided with cirrhi or barbels. Eyes quite large. Isthmus small. Caudal fins 

 forked ; insertion of ventrals situated in advance of the anterior margin of the 

 dorsal. Scales large ; lateral line forming a very open curve, convex down- 

 wards." Pharyngeal bones much stouter superiorly than inferiorly ; a slight 

 expansion may be observed upon the convexity of these bones, extending up- 

 wards. The teeth are of the bruising kind of the hooked type with a slight hook 

 and a well developed grinding surface, both edges of which being strongly 

 crenated. They are disposed upon a single row of five, thus : 5 5. The three 

 uppermost (sometimes the upper two only), stand out in bold relief from the 

 line of the bone. 



We meant to have observed, in speaking of the head, that the lower jaw fits 

 into the upper one when the mouth is shut without protrusion of the snout, and 

 that when the mouth is partly open, the lower jaw aj^pcars longer than the 

 upper.

5. LuxiLUS LEPTOSOMUS. Outline regularly subfusiform ; the depth forming a 

 little more than the fifth of the entire length. The head enters five times 

 and a half in the same dimension. The anal fin is a great deal larger than 

 the dorsal. The scales are larger than in any other species of the same 

 genus.

 der Major W. H. Emory, TJ. S. A., Commissioner U. S. and Mex. Boundary. 



G. LuxiLUS SECo. Body deeper than in L. leptosomiis ; depth equal to the 

 fourth of total length. Head contained five times and a half in the same dimen- 

 sion. Eye very large ; its diameter entering three times only in the length of 

 the side of the head. Mouth small. Scales of moderate development. Light 

 brown above, yellowish white beneath ; sides silvery. 



Specimens of this species were collected in the Rio Seco, a tribunary of the 

 Rio Nueces, Texas, by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, under Lieut. A. W. Whipple, U. S. A. 



7. LuxiLUS LuciDus. General form resembling that of L. seco. The head, 

 however, is contained but four times in the length of the side of the head. 

 The mouth is a good deal larger, whilst the eye is smaller. The scales, like- 

 wise, attain to a greater development. The color is the same as in the preceding 

 species, with the exception that the tint of the back has a greyish hue and 

 extends more to the sides. 



Collected by H. B. MoUhausen, under Lieut. A. W. Whipple, TJ. S. A., in 

 Coal Creek, a tributary of the South Fork of the Canadian River, and also 

 twenty miles west of Choctaw Agency. 



In the Ichthyologia ohiensis we find the genus 



Semotilus, Rafin. 



which, though imperfectly characterised, leaves not doubt as to the species the 

 author intended to include in it. Semotilus dorsalis and Semotilus ccphalus, are 

 both well known species. S. diplemia, on the other hand, does not come under 

 this head. The genus Semotilus we therefore restore with the following charac- 

 ters : Head subconical, both jaws equal or else even anteriorly ; cleft of mouth 

 slightly oblique upwards. The mouth itself being large, surmounted with soft 

 lips and without barbels. The isthmus is rather narrow. The insertion of the 

 ventral fins is situated in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal fin which 

 is higher than long. The caudal is bifurcated. The scales, of moderate size. 

 The pharyngeal bones are narrow, very slightly expanded upon the upper half 

 of their curve. The teeth are of the voratorial kind, of the hooked type with- 

 out grinding surface, stoutish, moderately hooked and disposed upon a double 

 row in the following manner: 2 | 5 5 | 2; sometimes 2 | 4 5 | 2. Generally 

 speaking, a black or brown spot may be observed at the base of the anterior 

 margin of the dorsal fin. 




204 [September, 



Besides the two species just referred to, the present genus will include : 



3. Sbmotilus ateomacclatus. Oyprinus airomaculatus, Mitch. Leuciscus airo- 

 muculatus of more moderu writers. Leuciscus iris, Val. in Cuv. ^- Val., Hist. 

 Nat. Poiss. sii. 1844, 255, pi. 496. 



4. Semotilus macrocephalus. Easily distinguished by its very large head 

 which forms more than the fourth of the entire length. Its body is very much 

 compressed and tapering posteriorly. The scales are more uniformly imbricated 

 than in S. airotnaculahis, in which there is a noted difference it that respect be- 

 tween the anterior and posterior portions of the body. The species of this 

 genus are generally very uniform ; the number of the rays of the fins hardly 

 undergoes any variation. In the present species they stand as follows : 



D 9+2 ; A 9 + 2 ; C 6, 1, 9, 8, 1, 5 ; V 8 ; P 15. 



Two rudimentary rays in front of both the dorsal and anal, one of which very 

 exiguous. Brownish grey above ; silvery white beneath. A black spot at the 

 base of caudal also. 



Specimens were collected at Fort Pierre, Nebr., by Dr. John Evans, U. S. 

 Geologist. 



5. Semotilus speciosus. A graceful and slender fish, subfusiform in its out- 

 line, the head, which is conical and pointed forwards, constituting exactly the 

 the fourth of the entire length. The ventrals are situated a little further than 

 in S. atromaculalits. The scales of the dorsal region in advance of the dorsal fin 

 are quite small ; and those on the thoracic region smaller than posteriorly along 

 the sides of the tail. 



There are thirteen rays in the pectorals ; the number of rays in the other fins 

 does not diifer from the preceding species. 



The dorsal region is reddish brown ; the abdomen is yellowish or whitish. A 

 black vitta extends from the nose across the face and eye to the base of the 

 caudal, where exists also a circular black spot, similar to the one upon the base 

 of the anterior margin of the dorsal. 



Collected in the Sweet Water, a tributary of Platte or Nebraska River, by the 

 late J. Soule Bowman, 



We come next to a small fish, constituting a new genus, not without analogy 

 with the Gudgeons, differing from the true Gudgeons, by the absence of barbels 

 either maxillary or buccal and a less prominent snout. We propose to call it 



TIAROGA, 



and characterise it as follows : Head small, subconical, depressed. Mouth 

 obliquely terminal, of moderate size and without barbels of any kind. Upper 

 jaw slightly longer than the lower. Eye of medium size. Isthmus very wide. 

 Body slender, subfusiform, compressed. Fins are well developed ; dorsal and 

 anal narrow and high ; caudal bifurcated. The insertion of the ventrals takes 

 place in advance the anterior margin of the dorsal. The scales are small ; the 

 lateral line, medial. The pharyngeals are similar to those in Gohio. The teeth 

 are likewise of the same character : slender, subcylindrical upon their base com- 

 pressed above, of the raptatorial kind of the hooked type, without grinding 

 surface and disposed upon a double row of one and three, thus: 1 | 3 3 | 1. 

 So far but one single species is known. 



Tiaroga cobitis. About two inches and a half in total length, the head 

 forming about the fifth of it. The eyes approximate the upper surface of the 

 head which is rounded. The upper regions are brownish, with small blackish 

 spots; the inferior regions are unicolor of a yellowish tint. A black spot upon 

 the base of the caudal fin. 



Specimens collected by John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham, in the Rio 

 San Pedro, a tributary of the Rio Gila. 




1856.] 205 



About three years since, the genus 



Gila, B. & G. 

 was proposed, to include species whose body was subfusiform, compressed, with 

 the back more or less arched, especially in large and old specimens, and some- 

 times tapering very much posteriorly, with the peduncle of the tail very slender. 

 The head being depressed and proportionally small, with its upper outline often 

 concave ; the snout is elongated ; the eyes are of moderate size ; the isthmus 

 small. The mouth is of medium size, the upper jaw overlapping the lower, so 

 as to conceal its cleft from above. No barbels, or rudiments of barbels. The 

 pharyngeal bones are well developed, the inferior limb, elongated, the upper one 

 forming an open curve ; the'convexity being somewhat expanded, the expansion 

 tapering along the upper and inward limb. The teeth are well developed, of 

 the raptatorial kind of the hooked type, without grinding^surface, subcylindrical 

 slightly compressed and disposed upon a double row of one or two and four or 

 five as follows : 1 | 4 5 | 2, or even, 2 | 4 5 | 2. The ventral fins are inserted 

 in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal. The caudal is bifurcated. 

 The scales are small on the dorsal region and of medium size on the sides, and 

 longer than high. The lateral line forms an open curve along the middle of 

 the abdomen. 



The species which we now include in this genus, are the following :

"We separate from the genus Gila, under the name of 



TIGOMA, 

 some species formerly excluded by us in other genera, to which we add a fev/ 

 others not hitherto described. They all bear a general resemblance to Gila, 

 from which they differ by a much smaller mouth, and larger scales, and those 

 of the dorsal region, though smaller than on the sides, are not so disjjropor- 

 tionate. The ventrals are inserted in advance of the anterior margin of the 

 dorsal, and the caudal is bifurcated. It is not deemed superfluous to state that 

 there are no barbels at the angle of the mouth, and a characteristic of this o-e- 

 nus as distinct from Gila, consists in its tei'minal mouth and even jaws. The 

 pharyngeal bones resemble very much those of Gila, but the inferior limb is 

 not quite so long, the convexity not quite so expanded, and the upper limb more 

 curved inwards. As to the teeth, it requires a minute observation to detect a 

 difference ; they are more compressed and more strongly hooked, otherwise of 

 the raptatorial kind, of the hooked type either without a grinding surface, or 

 else a grinding surface more or less developed. They are disposed in the fol- 

 lowing wise : 2 | 5 5 | 2, 2 | 45 | 2, or 1 ] 45 | 2, and some intermediate 

 formulas.

3. TiGOMA BicoLOR. 'A large species, the largest of the genus hitherto known 

 to us. It is twelve inches in total length, the head forming the fourth of it. The 

 greatest depth is nearly equal to the length of the head. The eye is subcircu- 

 lar, and its diameter contained about six times in the length of the side of the 

 head. The origin of the ventrals is situated but slightly in advance of the 

 dorsal. The latter is higher than long throughout the genus. The scales are 

 quite large. The dortal region is bluish grey ; the sides and belly are silvery 

 white, sometimes golden, but always in contrast with the tint of the back. 



Specimens of this species were collected in Tlamath Lake, 0. T., by Dr. John 

 S. Newberry, under Lt. Williamson, U. S. A. 



4. TiGOMA ruRPCREA. This is a much stouter fish than T. pulchella, which 

 it resembles in other respects ; but its head is larger and its body shorter. The 

 anterior margin of the dorsal is nearer the extremity of the caudal than the tip 

 of the snout, whilst in T. pulchella it is nearer to the snout than the extremity 

 of the caudal. The scales are also larger than in T. pulchella. The color is of 

 purplish black above and on the sides ; beneath yellowish. 



Collected at San Bernardino, in the upper waters of Rio Huagui, west of the 

 Sierre Madre, by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, under Major W. H. Emory. 



5. TiGOMA INTERMEDIA. Intermediate between T. pulchella and T. purpurea, 

 more closely related however to the former than to the latter. The fins are 

 much less developed, the inferior fins especially are quite small. 



Collected in the Rio San Pedro, of the Gila, by John H. Clark, under Col. J. 

 D. Graham, U. S. A. 



6. TiGOMA OBESA. A very characteristic species by its short and deep body, 

 its short and conical head, and its small fins. It bears a general resemblance 

 to T. purpurea, but its head is much smaller. Color of dorsal region bluish 

 grey ; upper half of sides dotted, lower half unicolor and yellowish white like 

 the belly. 



Specimens of this species were collected in Salt Lake Valley by J. Soule 

 Bowman. 



7. TiGOMA HUMBOLDTi. Rcsemblcs T. obesa by a deep and rather short body, 

 but the latter is covered Avith much larger scales. The head and eyes are also 

 much larger. The dorsal region above the lateral line is bluish or greyish 

 black and so the upper surface of the head. The rest is red and golden, except 

 a narrow blackish streak below the lateral line, extending from the thoracic 

 belt to near the anal fin. 



Collected in Humboldt river by J. Soule Bowman, and Lt. E. G. Beckwith, 

 U. S. A. 



8. TiGOMA LiNEATA. The general aspect is elongated, the body being subfu- 

 siform, and the head small and conical, constituting a little less than the fourth 

 of the total length. The ground color is yellowish ; the centre of the scales 

 of the upper regions being black, the back and upper half of the flanks ap- 

 pear as if marked with alternate lines of black and yellow. 



Specimens of this species were likewise collected by Lt. E. G. Beckwith. 



9. TiGOMA GRACILIS The body is elongated and compressed, subfusiform, re- 

 sembling T. lineata, but the head is more elongated. The ventrals are inserted 

 but a little in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal, whilst they are more 

 so in T. lineata. In the latter the pectorals are short and broad ; in the present 

 species they are narrow and elongated. The scales are smaller than in T. 

 lineata. Bluish grey above and on the sides ; yellowish beneath.

Specimens were collected near Santa Cruz, by John H. Clark, under Col. J. 

 D. Graham, U. S. A. and at Tuczon, Sonora, by Dr. A. L. Heermann, under 

 Lt. J. G. Parke, U. S. A. 



11. TiGOMA NiGRESCENS This is quite an elegant species, being elongated 

 and slender like T. pulchella and T, gracilis. It differs from T. gibbosa by a more 

 conical head and snout. The ground color is yellftwish, the body of the scales 

 being covered with crowded black dots, the back and sides appear almost black, 

 The belly is unicolor. In the young, the upper regions are lighter than in the 

 adult. 



Specimens were collected in the Boca grande and Janos river, by Dr. C. B. 

 Kennerly under Major W. H. Emory, U. S. A. 



12. TiGOMA PULCHRA. The body is gracefully elongated, in which respect it 

 resembles T. nigrescens, from which it may be distinguished by its smaller head 

 and larger scales. The color, moreover, is of a far more brilliant tj'pe : the 

 dorsal region is reddish or blackish brown, the sides and belly of a uniform 

 golden yellow ; a diffused black streak may occasionally be seen along the 

 upper portion of the flanks, very likely more predominent in the male than in 

 the female. 



Collected in Chihuahua River and tributaries, by John Potts, Esq., of Chihua- 

 hua, Mex. 



13. TiGOMA CRASSA This species has a short and deep body ; the greatest 

 depth being more than the fourth of the entire length. The head is small and 

 conical, constituting nearly the fifth of the entire length of the fish. The scales 

 are very large, higher than long and the lateral line deflexed upon the abdo- 

 men as usually the case in this genus. The color of the back is bluish or 

 purplish black, greyish black on the sides where the yellowish ground color 

 appears ; beneath unicolor.

 berry, under Lt. R. S. Williamson, U. S. A. 



Next to these numerous species in which the system of dentition seems to be 

 in a unstable condition, we place the new genus 



CHEONDA, 



which has the general aspect of both Gila and Tigoma, by the position of the 

 ventrals in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal, by the absence of barbels 

 at the angle of the mouth, which is of moderate size. 



The body is elongated, fusiform in profile, and very much compressed. The 

 caudal fin is bifurcated. The head is rather small and subconical, and the 

 snout, though rounded, is yet elongated. The eye is large and the isthmus 

 small or narrow. The scales being of medium size and the lateral line greatly 

 deflexed upon the abdomen. The teeth are of the prehensile kind, of the 

 hooked type, with a grinding surface ; they are compressed and disposed upon 

 a double row of two and four and five, thus : 2 | 4 5 | 2. 



1. Cheonda cooperi. The fins are well developed and the anal is larger 

 than the dorsal. Their formula is as follows : 



D 10-hl2 ; A 11 + 2 ; C 7, 1, 9, 8, 1, 6 ; V O-j-l ; P 16, 



The dorsal region is reddish grey ; the sides and belly silvery white, with a 

 golden reflect. 



Collected at Fort Vancouver, Columbia River, by Dr. John G. Cooper. 



2. Cheonda ccerulea. May readily be distinguished from its congener by 




208 [September, 



the presence of mitch smaller fin ; the anal Is a good deal smaller than the dorsal, 

 and the ventrals a little less anterior, with reference to the dorsal. 



D 10+2 ; A 8-f 2 ; 6, 1, 9, 8, 1,5; V 10+1 ; P 16. 



Upper regions of a greyish azur ; inferior regions dull silvery white ; black 

 dots scattered all over the back, sides and belly. 



Caught in Lost River, 0. T., by Dr. John S. Newberry, under Lt. R. S. 'William- 

 son, U. S. A. 



There is another generic type, for which we have provided the name of 



, SiBOMA, 



composed so far of but two species, one of which originally referred to the 

 genus Lavinia. It is to be recognized by a stout and somewhat compressed 

 body, covered with large scales. The caudal is crescent-shaped posteriorly; 

 the origin of the ventrals is situated a little posteriorly to the anterior margin 

 of the dorsal, or immediately under it. The head is rather small, sloping 

 towards a wedge-shaped snout, rounded superiorly. The mouth is of small 

 size, horizontal, terminal, with jaws even. No barbels. Eye below the me- 

 dium size. Isthmus rather narrow. Pharygngeal bones stout, expanded upon 

 their convexity, with the inferior branch short and bent inwardly so that its 

 extremity is directed outwardly, whilst the upper branch is slightly bent 

 inwards. The teeth are large and very compressed, and terminated by a 

 slender hook. They arc of the raptatorial kind, of the hooked type without 

 grinding surface properly so called, but instead of a sharp edge along the inner 

 margin of the teeth, a blunt and narrow ridge may be observed. They 

 are disposed upon a double row of one and two and four and five, as fol- 

 lows : 1 I 45 I 2. 



1. SiBOMA CRASSiCAUDA. Lavinia crassicauda, B. & G. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. 

 Philad. viii. 1854, 137. 



Specimens of this species were procured by Dr. A. L. Heermann, under Lt. 

 R. Williamson, in the San Joaquin, Mercede and Mohave Rivers, Cal. 



2. SiBoifA ATRARiA. The largest specimen of this species which we have ex- 

 amined is about seven inches in length, and although small, compared to the 

 specimens of S. crassicauda, to which we had to compare it, yet the distinctive 

 features between the two species appear very striking. And first of all, the 

 imbrication of the scales in S. atraria, is such as to expose more of their surface 

 than in S. crassicauda, and moreover the lateral line in S. atraria runs along 

 the seventh row of scales from the insertion of the ventrals upwards, leaving 

 eleven rows above it, to the base of the dorsal fin, Avhilst in ^S'. crassicauda, there 

 are as many rows of scales below as above the lateral line. The absolute 

 number of longitudinal rows of scales is the same in both species. The head 

 is proportionally larger than in S. crassicaudu, but the fins are much less de- 

 veloped. The ground color is olivaceous, the sides and the back being nearly 

 black or brownish black, from the number of confluent maculae and dots. 

 The fins itself are blackish upon an olivaceous ground. The sides and upper part 

 of the head, arc likewise brownish black. 



Found in a spring, in Utah District, near the Desert, by Lt. E. G. Beckwith. 



The species which are arranged under the genus 



Ptyciiochkilus, Agass. 



remind us by their general appearance of both 3Iylocheilus and Mylopharodon. 

 They have an elongated, subcylindrical and compressed body, an elongateel 

 head, a mouth deejily cleft, but no barbels upon its angle. The upper jaw 

 overlaps the lower, though the mouth remains horizontal and subterminal. 

 The eye is of moderate size; and so with the isthmus. The ventral fins are 

 inserted a little in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal. The caudal 

 is furcated. The scales,. of medium size ; the lateral line nearly medial. The 




1856.] 209 



pharyngeal bones are long and slender, slightly expanded upon their convexity, 

 with the inferior limb much more slender than the upper. The teeth are of the 

 raptatorial Icind, of the hoolied type without grinding surface, subconical, 

 slightly hooked, and disposed upon a double series of two and four or five, 

 thus: 2 I 4 4 | 2, or 2 [ 55 | 2.

 mette River, by Dr. Newberry, under Lt. Williamson, U. S. A. 



3. Ptychocheilus rap ax. This is a large species too, differing from P. grandis 

 by a proportionally shorter head, a more advanced position of the ventral fins 

 and by much smaller scales on the dorsal region in advance of the dorsal. The 

 inferior limb of the pharyngeal bones is not so long and slender, and there are 

 but four teeth upon the main row, instead of five. The teeth and bones are 

 stouter. Colors, blackish brown above ; whitish beneath. 



From Monterey, Cal. ; collected by Lt. W. P. Trowbridge, TJ. S. A. 



4. Ptychocheilus lucius. A very characteristic species. The body is com- 

 pressed, but the head is flattened or depressed and very much developed, con- 

 stituting nearly the fourth of the entire length. The dorsal and ventrals are 

 situated quite posteriorly. The scales are below the medium size, and the 

 lateral line is bent downwards upon the abdomen. The pharyngeal bones are 

 very slender ; the inferior limb is almost exiguous and proportionally as long 

 as in P. grandis. There are, however, but four teeth upon the main row, instead of 

 five, as in the case of P. grandis. Color bluish grey above ; silvery gclden 

 beneath. 



Collected in the Rio Colorado, by A. Schott, under Major W. H. Emory, 

 Commissioner U. S. and Mex. Boundary. 



5. Ptychocheilus vorax. The head is also depressed in this species, but it is 

 much smaller since it contitutes the two-ninths of the entire length. The 

 body is much deeper than in P. lucius, and the ventrals are situated more in 

 advance of the dorsal. The dorsal itself is not situated so far back. The scales are 

 very small upon the dorsal region between the dorsal fin and the occiput. 

 Bluish above ; silvery beneath. 



Specimens were brought home by Lt. E. G. Beckwith, U. S. A. The precise 

 locality, not known. 



APPENDIX, 



The following species are here recorded as complementary to the preceding 

 ones. 



1. Hybognathus REGIUS. A large and beautiful species, the largest that 

 has, so far, come to our knowledge, some of the specimens measuring seven 

 inches in length. The body is gracefully elongated, compressed, fusiform 

 in its outline. The greatest depth, taken immediately in advance of the dorsal 

 fin is contained about five times in the length, or five, and a third of a time. 

 The head is of moderate development, subconical, subtruncated, contained six 

 times in the total length. The mouth is quite small. The isthmus, very narrow. 

 The origin of the ventrals recedes a little from the anterior margin of the dorsal, 



16

which anterior margin of the dorsal, is nearer to the tip of the snout than the 

 base of the central rays of the caudal. 



D 2+9; A 2+9; C 5, 1, 9, 8, 1, '7 ; V 8 ; P 15. 



There are thirty-eight scales in the lateral line ; six longitudinal rows above 

 it, and four beneath, upon the line of greatest depth. Color brownish red 

 above, pale reddish beneath ; flanks shining of silver and gold. 



Inhabits the Potomac River, and probably all the fresh waters of Maryland. 

 It is commonly called Smelt, at Washington and vicinities, and Gudgeon at 

 Baltimore and surrounding counties.

Body elongated, compressed, fusiform in profile, and covered with quite large 

 scales. The lateral line being nearly medial. The head is of but moderate size ; 

 the snout being subconical and rounded anteriorly. The mouth is subterminal, 

 somewhat protractile, in which situation it is directed obliquely forwards and 

 downwards ; when shut, the lower jaw fits within the upper, the snout being 

 slightly protruding. There are no barbels about the mouth. The eyes are large ; 

 the isthmus is small. The dorsal is higher than long ; its anterior margin is even 

 with the insertion of the ventrals. The anal has a proportionally longer base 

 than the dorsal. The caudal is deeply furcated. The pharyngeal bones are 

 well developed ; the inferior limb is rather short, its extremity being flattened 

 and slightly turned outwardly. From the middle of the convexity a sudden 

 expansion occurs, tapering into the upper limb, slightly curved downwards. 

 The teeth are of the bruising kind, of the hooked type, provided with a grinding 

 surface. But there occurs many irregularities, being more or less hooked and 

 the grinding surface more or less developed. It is not uncommon to observe 

 all these variations upon the pharyngeal of a single specimen. The teeth are 

 disposed upon a double row with the following variations : 2 | 4 4 | 2, 

 2 I 44 I 1, 1 44 I 2, or I 44 | 1.

2. HuDSONius AMARUS. This species is closely allied to the preceding, 

 from which it diS"ers by a smaller head and smaller eye. Its opercle is 

 also broader compared to its height or depth. The head constitutes the sixth 

 of the total length. The greatest depth taken immediately in advance of the 

 dorsal, enters a little over five times in the total length. 



The coloration is nearly the same as in Jl.fluviatUis, with the exception that 

 the black snot at the base of the tail disappears at a much earlier period. The 

 species grows to a much larger size also ; we have seen specimens seven inches 

 long, in which the satin band along the sides and the black spot of the tail had 

 given way to a uniform golden hue extending to nearly the entire body. 



Caught in Chesapeake Bay, and as far up the Potomac River as Washington, 

 where it is caught along side with Hijhognathus regius, and similarly called 

 Smelt. 



Hybopsis, Agass. 



This genus was left rather vaguely defined by its author, for there are many 

 genera in which "the mouth is protractile downwards, after the fashion of 

 Catostomus" with the lips neither swollen nor thickened. And many other genera 




1856.] 211 



too, in which there is " only four or five compressed and hooked teeth in each 

 main row, and one or two in a second row." What is really of generic value 

 is left for us to conjecture, since we are not in possession of its typical species. 



The generic characters which we now offer are based upon Leu ciscus star erianus 

 and a new species from Alabama, and should they prove generally distinct from 

 H. gracilis, a new name will have to be coined for our species. 



Body elongated, compressed, subfusiform in profile, covered with rather 

 large scales. The lateral line being straight, along the middle of the flanks. 

 The head is of moderate size, subconical and rounded upon the snout which 

 protrudes beyond the lower jaw. A barbel, inserted upon the anterior margin 

 of the posterior extremity of the maxillar}', maj' he seen at the angle of the 

 mouth. The eyes are large, th'e isthmus narrow. The dorsal is a little higher, 

 and the anal deeper, than long. The insertion of the ventrals takes place 

 opposite the second ray of the dorsal, hence very nearly under its anterior 

 margin. The tail is deeply furcated. The pharyngeal bones have the same 

 form and appearance as in Hudsonius ; the teeth are likewise of the same kind 

 (bruising) and type (hooked with a grinding surface), but more irregular yet. 

 Sometimes not hooked, the grinding surface contorted and nearly absent, or 

 even resembling a truncated cone. They are disposed upon a double row of 

 four and one : 1 | 4 4 | 1, or j 4 4 | 1. 



This genus, it will appear, is intimately related to Hudsonius, from which it 

 chiefly differs by the presence of barbels at the angle of the mouth, and by its 

 straight lateral line also.

 the same is the case with the scales. The color is pale red with a silvery streak 

 along the middle of the flanks.

CLINOSTOMUS. 



A genus instituted to include several new species, together with one pre- 

 viously described as a Leuciscus. Its characters are as follows : Body elongated, 

 compressed, subfusiform in profile. The head is compressed like the body, the 

 frontal surface being very declivous and sloping towards a pointed rostrum, so 

 that in profile the head is subtriangular, and if broader, would be wedge-shaped 

 when seen from above. The mouth is very large, the lower jaw longer than 

 the upper, beyond which it protrudes, giving to the cleft an oblique direction 

 upwards. The eye is very large ; the isthmus, quite narrow. The dorsal is 

 higher than long, and inserted on the space between the ventrals and the anal, 

 a little nearer to the former than the latter in a vertical line. The caudal is 

 deeply furcated. The scales are of but moderate development, varying con- 

 siderably in size between the different species. The lateral line forms a down- 

 wards curve upon the abdomen so as to bring its convexity nearer to the ventral 

 than the dorsal outline. The pharyngeal bones are rather slender, the lower 

 limb especially; a slight expansion may be observed upon their convexity; the 

 upper limb being flattened, bent inwardly and either shorter or of equal length 

 with the lower limb. The teeth are of the raptatorial kind, of the hooked type 

 without grinding surface, and disposed thus : 2 | 4 4 | 2, or 2 | 5 4 | 2, and 

 sometimes 1 | 4 4 | 2. 



This genus is more closely related to Ptychocheilus than to any other of the 

 family. The pharyngeal teeth are constructed upon the same pattern ; the 

 chief difference being found in the inclined cleft of the mouth, and the pro- 

 trusion of the lower jaw beyond the upper.

Inhabits most of the tributaries of the Ohio River. 



2. Clinostomus fonduloides. The body is proportionally much shorter 

 than in C. elongatus, and less tapering posteriorly also. The head consti- 

 tutes a little more than the fifth of the entire length. The greatest depth is 

 equal to the length of the head. The eye is a little smaller than in any of its 

 hitherto known congener ; its diameter entering three times in the length of the 

 side of the head. The scales are a good deal larger than in C. elongatus. The 

 color is of a pale red, with a silvery hue along the middle of the flanks, and a 

 few scattered black spots. 



The specimens before us we caught in the creeks and inlets of the Potomac 

 River, in the neighborhood of Washington, D. C, the largest of which measuring 

 about three inches. 



3. Clinostomus afpixis. Resembles the preceding one in its general bear- 

 ing. The body however seems to be more tapering posteriorly, the head 

 larger and the mouth more deeply cleft, since the posterior extremity of the 

 maxillary reaches a vertical line passing through the anterior rim of the pupil, 

 whilst in C . funduloides the extremity of the same bone extends but half way 

 between the anterior rim of the orbit and the pupil. The eye is a little larger 

 also, whilst the scales are smaller. 



Inhabits the waters of James River, Va. Collected by S. F. Baird. 



4. Clinostomus carolinus. The head is larger than in C. affinis, and the 

 body more elongated, compared to the depth. The eye is a great deal larger, 

 and the scales smaller. Blackish brown above, with scattered black spots ; 

 reddish beneath ; flanks golden. 



From Salem, N. C. Collected by J. T. Lineback and School. Specimens 

 sent to the Smithsonian Institution. 



Alburnus lepidulus. The most slender and elongated of the species 

 hitherto known to us. The total length is about four inches, in which length, 

 the depth enters a little over eight times. The head itself constitutes about 

 the sixth of the length. The posterior extremity of the maxillary scarcely 

 reaches the vertical line drawn in advance of the orbit. The caudal fin is a 

 little longer than the head. The anterior margin of the dorsal fin is nearly 

 equidistant between the tip of the snout and the concavity of the caudal. The 

 pectorals and ventrals are rather small. A broad silvery band maybe observed 

 above the lateral line. 



Specimens from Black' Warrior River, Ala. Prof. A. Winchell. 



Plargyrus argentatus. A specimen of this species is about three 

 inches long, the head forming the fifth of the entire length. A vertical line 

 drawn across the anterior rim of the orbit, intersects the extremity of the 

 maxillary bone. The eye is large ; its diameter entering three times in the 

 side of the head. The dorsal scales anterior to the dorsal fin are quite small, 

 contrasting greatly with those of the side which are well developed. The 

 anterior margin of the dorsal is nearer to the insertion of the rays of the caudal 

 fin than the tip of the snout. The dorsal region is pale red, whilst the sides 

 appear as if coated with silver.

CERATICHTHYS, Baird. 



Body elongated, fusiform or subfusiform, somewhat compressed. Head 

 flattened above, very declivous anteriorly with the snout rounded and over- 

 lapping the lower jaw. Mouth moderate in size, subterminal and horizontal 




1856.] 213 



provided with a barbel upon its angle, and inserted upon the extremity of the 

 maxillary bone. Eye approximating the upper surface of the head, and rather 

 moderate in size. The isthmus is wide. The insertion of the ventrals is even 

 with a vertical line drawn from the anterior margin of the dorsal fin. The 

 latter is higher, and the anal deeper than long. The scales are large, and the 

 lateral line nearly straight along the middle of the flanks. The pharyngeal 

 bones are pretty stout upon their convexity which is very slightly expanded, 

 whilst the upper and lower branches are nearly equally developed, the latter 

 however, more slender. The teeth are stoutish, compressed, of the prehensile 

 kind of the hooked type, generally without grinding surface. Sometimes, 

 however, a grinding surface may be observed upon some of the teeth which are 

 subject to some variations being compressed or else subconical, generally 

 hooked and occasionally conical. They are disposed upon a single row : 4 4 .

 its congener, by its small head which enters four times and a half in the 

 total length. The body itself is proportionally shorter than in C. amhlops 

 especially. Its scales are likewise larger than in the latter species. The color 

 is of a uniform blackish grey above, and greyish white beneath. 



Specimens were collected at Salem, N. C, by J. T. Lineback and School, and 

 preserved in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. 



NocoMis BELLicus. It is a more bulky and deeper fish than its con- 

 gener from Nebraska. And what is still more characteristic, its head is 

 smaller, hence its mouth smaller also. We could not detect the small teeth 

 constituting the inner row, but supposed they got lost in the preparation of the 

 pharyngeal bones. At any rate, whetlier lost or entirely absent, we have here 

 a second species of the genus Nocomis. Color reddish above ; reddish yellow 

 beneath, with an obsolete black spot upon the base of the caudal.

Description of the Byssus in the genus Unio. 

 By Isaac Lea. 



Professor Kirtland published in the American Journal of Science for July. 

 1840,* some observations he had made on the anatomical and physiological 

 characters of the Naiades, and was the first a few years before to have noticed, 

 that at least some species of Unio, when very young, were anchored to some 

 foreign substances by " a small silky filament" attached to the foot. I had 

 casually observed the fact in a single instance, in Unio complanaius from the 

 Schuylkill, but had not the opportunity of again witnessing it. The Professor 

 followed up his discovery at different periods, and found thus attached the young 

 of the following species ; viz., zigzag, elegans, dehiscens, ebenus, crassus, foliatus, 

 pyramidatus, crassidens and gibbosus. 



The fact at the time was considered of great interest, and it was verj' much 

 desired that further observations should have been made. Nothing has, how- 

 ever, to my knowledge, been since published in connexion with the subject 

 neither in this country nor in Europe. M. D'Orbigny discovered in the Rio 

 Parana, South America, a very remarkable fresh water bivalve, which he named 



* Page 167 figs, a and b. 




214 [September, 



Byssanodonta Paranensis, (V03'. dans I'Ameriqiie Merid.) This always remains 

 attached by a byssus, proceeding from the foot. It has amterior and posterior 

 adductor muscles. 



In the examination of the soft parts of a very large number of species of this 

 family, from Georgia, which I have been enabled to do through the kindness of 

 Bishop Elliott, I have noticed in the adults of two small species, a perfect bi/ssus 

 attached to the lower portion of the foot, posterior to the base. 



In dissecting five specimens of Unio acuiissimus, nobis, from Etowah River, 

 Georgia, I found in a full grown specimen, one and a quarter inches wide, a 

 large fine byssits, fully an inch in length, thicker than a horse hair, quite flattened, 

 semitransparent, and without any appearance of fibre, but rather hornlike. At 

 the point of insertion in the foot, the filament is a little enlarged and rounded, 

 and there is also at the same point the rudiment or remains of a second one. 

 The other extreme end of this filament, where it was attached to the foreign sub- 

 stance to which the animal had anchored itself, is evidently perfect, shewing the 

 true length of the bi/ssus. At this end it is divided into four branches, undoubt- 

 edly having been attached. Of the five specimens before me, one only has the 

 byssus remaining ; but it is evident, from the fact that each of the others has a 

 longitudinal cicatrix at the point of the former attachment, that every one had 

 been furnished with a byssiis. 



I found also that the same kind of byssus existed in the adult of the closely 

 allied species, Unio Conradicus, nobis, which accompanied the above from the 

 same locality. There are three of this species, one of which has a portion of the 

 byssus attached in the same manner, but evidently broken off and not being more 

 than the fourth of an inch long. This filament is much more delicate than that 

 described above, not being thicker than a human hair. It is not flattened, but 

 rounded. Close to its insertion in the foot is a second one, shorter and probably 

 the remains of a separate filament of attachment, the genus Pinna having in- 

 numberable fine threads of attachment, the shell itself of one species being some- 

 times found more than two feet in length. 



In all the eight specimens of the two Unioncs above mentioned, the impressed 

 cut or cicatrix made by the byssus is very observable, so that there cannot re- 

 main a doubt, but that they had all been attached until they had arrived at 

 adolescence. 



As part of these were no doubt anchored when taken from the water, and 

 part of them free and locomotive, it appears that it cannot be necessary to 

 their existence that they should retain their normal condition of attachment. 



There are other allied species, forming with these a group, oi Vihich acutissimus 

 is the type, which I have not had the advantage of examining ; but I have no 

 doubt that those will all be found to be also anchored by a byssus, in the same 

 manner. 



These facts will I hope draw the attention of the Zoologist more closely to ob- 

 serve the habits of this family.

Notice upon the Species of the genus Salmo, of authors, observed chiefly in Oregon 



and California. 



By Charles Girard, M. D. 



In the 21st volume of the " Histoire Naturelle des Poisons," published in 

 1848, Valenciennes subdivides the genus Salmo of Artedi, Linnaeus, and others 

 into three genera: the salmons proper (^Salmo), the salmon trouts (Fario), and 

 the brook trouts (Salar), each characterised by the number and arrangement of 

 the vomerine teeth. 



This method we have applied to the species of the present synopsis, which is 

 but an abstract of a more elaborate memoir to be published shortly, accompanied 

 with figures of most of the species. 



Needless to say that the observations here recorded have all been made upon 

 specimens preserved in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. 



The sources whence specimens were obtained, are enumerated under each 

 special heading ; all being well known to the lovers and cultivators of Natural 

 History. 



Genus Salmo, (Artedi), Valenc. 



Gkn. char. Body fusiform ; head large ; mouth generally deeply cleft, and. 

 armed with conspicuous teeth. Pre-maxillary (intermaxillary) bones short and 

 rather situated upon the sides of the snout than upon its extremity ; the max- 

 illaries are attached behind them and composed of a single bone. The lower jaw 

 is strong, and terminates frequently into a small knob or tubercle, which, in 

 some species, acquires a very great developement. Strong and conical teeth, 

 disposed upon a single row, are implanted upon the dentary. A f-ew teeth on 

 the front of the vomer; none on the shaft of that same bone ; a single row of 

 them is also observed along the palatines, and two rows upon the pterygoids 

 and upon the tongue. There is one anterior dorsal fin, followed posteriorly by a 

 small adipose more or less thick. The caudal is well developed, and either 

 truncated posteriorly or slightly emarginated.

The scales, on all the species, have that common character of being deprived 

 of those radiating grooves or furrows which extends from the organic centre of 

 the scale to its periphery. The concentric, or lines of growth, are the only ones 

 extant, and, in many instances (in Salmo and Fario, especially), they are inter- 

 rupted or else have become obsolete upon the posterior section of tha scales. 

 In many instances, also, they have disappeared from the organic centre itself, 

 which, under the microscope, appears perfectly homogeneous. Generally speak- 

 ing, their outline is subelliptical, elongated in the direction of the longitudinal 

 or horizontal axis of the body. Differences of minor value may be observed in 

 each species.

Body fusiform in profile, compressed. Head forming about the fifth of the 

 entire length. Maxillary bone curved, extending beyond the orbit. Dorsal 

 region olivaceous, studded with irregular black spots ; dorsal and caudal fins 




218 [October, 



similarly spotted. Region beneath the lateral line, nnicolor ; silvery along the 

 middle of the flanks, and yellowish on the belly. Inferior fins unicolor. Head, 

 aboTe blackish grey, its sides bluish grey. 



A specimen from Columbia river, was preserved by Dr. Geo. Suckley, under 

 Gov. I. I. Stevens. 



3. Salmo spectabilis, Grd. Body subfusiform in profile, very much com- 

 pressed, the head forming about the fourth of the total length. Maxillary bone 

 curved, extending to a vertical line passing somewhat posteriorly to the entire 

 orbit. Anterior margin of dorsal fin, a little nearer the extremity of the snout 

 than the base of the caudal. Bluish grey above ; silvery beneath. Dorsal region 

 and upper portion of the flanks spread over with light spots. 



By its general appearance, this species resembles Sal/no hoodii most, but may 

 readily be distinguished from it by a more elongated and elliptical head, hence 

 a mouth more deeply cleft, with the maxillary extending further back. 



Specimens collected at St. Mary's Mission, Flathead valley, Oregon, by Dr. 

 Geo. Suckley, U. S. A., under Gov. I. I. Stevens.

 jaw longest. Maxillary gently undulating ; its posterior extremity extending to 

 a vertical line passing considerably behind the entire orbit. Anterior margin 

 of dorsal fin equidistant between tlae tip of the snout and the insertion of the 

 caudal. Ground color greyish silvery above ; sides and belly yellowish orange

Body very much elongated, compressed, fusiform in profile ; head forming 

 about the sixth of the total length. Snout rounded, with the jaws subequal. 

 Maxillary gently curved, dilated posteriorly, and extending to a vertical line 

 passing slightly behind the orbit. Anterior margin of dorsal fin nearer the ex- 

 tremity of the snout than the insertion of the caudal fin. Ground color of dorsal 

 region olivaceous, clouded with bluish brown, and scattered about with round- 

 ish black spots which extend over the dorsal, the adipose and the caudal 

 fins. Upper surface of head bluish black. Sides and inferior region of the 

 body unicolor, yellowish brown ; inferior fins unicolor also. Sides of head 

 yellowish. 



A female specimen 26 inches long, caught at Fort Dallas on the Columbia 

 River, Oregon, was skinned and preserved by Dr. Geo. Suckley, U. S. A., under 

 Gov. I. I. Stevens. 



3. Fario argyreus, Grd. Body very much compressed, rather deep upon its 

 middle region and quite tapering posteriorly. Head moderate, constituting the 

 fifth of the entire length. Jaws equal. Maxillary slightly curved ; its free ex- 

 tremity extending to a vertical line drawn posteriorly to the orbit. Anterior 

 margin of dorsal fin nearer the extremity of the snout than the insertion of the 

 caudal fin. Bluish grey above ; silvery along the middle of the flanks ; yellowish 

 white beneath. 



This species is quite characteristic in its outline, since it is much more taper- 

 ing towards the tail than in any other of its congeners. In other respects it re- 

 sembles somewhat Fario aurora, but its elongated and low anal fin will distin- 

 guish it from the latter at the very first glance.

Genus Salar, Valenc. 



Gen. Char. All the characters of the Salmons, but differing from them as 

 well as from the genus Fario in being provided with a double row of teeth upon 

 the shaft of the vomer, and none on the front of that same bone. 



Syn. Salar, Valeno. Hist. Nat. des Poiss. xxi, 1848, 314. 



1. Salar lewisi, Grd. Body rather thickish upon its middle region ; head 

 moderate, constituting a little less than the fifth of the total length. Lower 

 jaw longest. Maxillary gently curved, its posterior extremity reaching a verti- 

 cal line drawn immediately behind the orbit. Anterior margin of dorsal fin a 

 little nearer the extremity of the snout than the base of the caudal fin. Ground 

 color of the upper region bluish grey, of the inferior region yellow or orange. 

 The back, peduncle of tail, dorsal, adipose, and caudal fins, spotted with black. 

 The belly and lower fins are unicolor, a deep orange hue existing along the rays 

 and also in the shape of a dot upon the abdominal scales, and which disappears 

 by long standing in alcohol. 



This is the trout alluded to in Lewis and Clarke's " Travels." They " caught 

 (at the Falls of the Missouri) half a dozen trout from sixteen to twenty-three 




220 [October, 



inches long, precisely resembling in form and the position of the fins, the moun- 

 tain or specklrtd trout of the United States, except that the specks of the former 

 are of a deep black, while those of the latter are of a red or gold color : they 

 have long sharp teeth on the palate and tongue, and generally a small speck of 

 red on each side behind the front ventral fins ; the flesh is of a pale yellowish 

 red, or when in good order, of a rose colored red." London edition of 1814, p. 

 192, 4to. A.nd further on, page 487, we read: "The mountain or speckled 

 trout are found in the waters of the Columbia within the mountains ; they are 

 the same with those found in the upper part of the Missouri, but are not so 

 abundant in the Columbia as in that river. We never saw this fish below the 

 mountains, but from the transparency and coldness of the Kooskoskee, we should 

 not doubt of its existence in that stream as low as its junction with the south 

 east branch of the Columbia." 



It would be an interesting point to compare, side by side, specimens caught 

 in the Columbia, with those of the Missouri river. We should not be surprised 

 if the result of such a composition should refer the specimens from the basin of 

 the Columbia to Fario gairdneri. 



Specimens of this species were collected at the Falls of the Missouri River, 

 Rocky Mountains, by Dr. Geo. Suckley, U. S. A., under Gov. I. I. Stevens. 



2. Salar virginalis, Grd. Body subfusiform in profile, otherwise compressed; 

 head comprised about four times in the length, the caudal fin excluded. Jaws 

 subequal ; posterior extremity of maxillary extending to a vertical line inter- 

 secting the posterior rim of the orbit. Anterior margin of dorsal nearer the 

 extremity of the snout than the insertion of the caudal fin. Greyish brown 

 above with a purplish reflection and subcircular black spots ; beneath, olivaceous, 

 unicolor. 



Specimens collected by the party under Lt. Beckwith, in Utah creek, and at 

 Sangre de Cristo Pass, upper waters of the Rio Grande del Norte (Rio Bravo). 



3. Salar iridea, Grd. Sal-mo iridea, Gibbons, Proc. Cal. Acad. Nat. Sc. i. 

 1855, 36. Salmo rivularis, Ayres, Proc. Cal. Acad. Nat. Sc. i, 1855, 43. Body 

 subfusiform in profile, otherwise compressed ; head well developed, constituting 

 a little less than the fourth of the total length. Jaws subequal; posterior ex- 

 tremity of maxillary extending a little beyond the orbit. Anterior margin of 

 dorsal fin equidistant between the snout and the insertion of the caudal. Red- 

 dish brown above, with small and numerous black spots ; yellowish white 

 beneath. 



Specimens were collected in the headwaters of San Matteo Creek, Cal., by R. 

 D. Cutts ; at Petaluma, Cal. by E. Samuels, near Humboldt Bay, by Lt. W. P. 

 Trowbridge, and finally specimens obtained by Dr. Ayres, of San Francisco, 

 under the name of Salmo rivularis, proved identical with Salmo iridea, of Dr. 

 Gibbons. Dr. Gibbons' description was drawn from a very immature specimen, 

 but has the priority over Dr. Ayres's appellation. The aspect of the male is 

 quite diS'erent from that of the female, so that their identification requires a 

 very close study of their intrinsic characters.

 It differs very materially from the one about to be described. I do not find any 

 species of Hemidactylus inhabiting Jamaica in the Catalogue of Reptiles in the 

 British Museum, by Mr. Gray. 




222 [OCTOBER; 



Hemidactylus pr^signis, nob. 



Char. Mental plate large, and triangular ; immediately behind it a transverse 

 row of four plates, the two exterior large, the two middle quite small ; seven to 

 eight plates margin the upper jaw on each side, and as many the lower ; scales 

 upon the abdomen much larger than those upon throat and neck ; in the latter 

 regions granular ; color brownish above, lighter brown or grej'ish beneath. 



Description. The head is long and rather narrow, depressed in front, covered 

 above with granulations larger upon the front ; rostral plate large, somewhat 

 quadrangular in shape ; the nostril, which is more or less circular, situ- 

 ated at its upper and external angle ; of the seven plates which margin 

 the upper jaw the first appears to be the highest; these plates are all very dis- 

 tinct, and more or less quadrangular ; the mental plate is large and triangular, 

 broader than long; there are four plates immediately behind it, the two inter- 

 mediate very small, the two lateral, which are in contact with the first inferior 

 labial, quite large; the eyes are large, the pupil circular; auricular openings 

 moderate ; body moderately st<fut, covered above with granulations of nearly 

 equal size; tail longer than head, neck and body, rather stout at base, covered 

 above and upon the sides with imbricated scales, jsresenting below a longitu- 

 dinal row larger than the others ; chin and throat covered with small granulations 

 of nearly equal size ; the abdomen is covered ivith smooth and qvite large imhricated 

 scales, contrasting strongly with the small granulations upon the chin and throat ; 

 under surface of extremities covered with scales, those of the posterior much 

 larger ; granulations above ; anterior surface of thighs with scales ; the thumbs 

 are deprived of nails, the remaining toes dilated with undivided subdigital 

 laminEe ; no femoral or anal pores.

lUmcnsions. Length of head 9 lines ; greatest breadth 6 ; length of neck and 

 body to vent 1 inch 8 lines ; of tail 3^ inches ; of arm 3 lines ; of forearm 3 ; of 

 hands to extremity of longest finger 4 ; of thigh 6 lines ; of leg 4 lines ; of feet 

 to extremity of longest toe 5 J lines. 



Habitat. Jamaica. Two specimens presented by Caspar W. Pennock, Esq., M.D. 



Gen. Remarks. This species differs very much from the only species of Pero- 

 pus heretofore described ; among other particulars in the following ; It has four 

 scales behind the mental instead of six. In Ouallensis there are twenty-four 

 superior labial plates and twenty-six inferior ? and the scales upon the under 

 surface of the animal are not represented as unequal in size. 



Fam. IGUANIDJE. 

 Lezards lauANiENS ou Sauriens Eunotes, Dumeril et Bibron. , 

 NOROPS, Wagler. 



The following are the characters of the genus Norops as given by Dumeril 

 and Bibron, (Erpet. Gen. Tome iv. p. 81.) 



" Skin beneath the neck forming a salient fold ; a sort of small throat pouch 

 without denticulations ; neither palatine teeth nor femoral pores. Fourth toe of 

 the foot longer than the third. Scales of the body carinated, in part imbricate ; 

 those upon the sides much smaller than upon the back and abdomen. Tail 

 moderate, not prehensile, destitute of crest like the back." 



But one species of this genus has been described, viz., Norops auratus, from 

 Surinam and other parts of Guiana. The specimen in our collection, received 

 from the Garcilen of Plants, is from Mexico. The toes are dilated, but not to so 

 great an extent as in many species of Anolis. The present species with the same 

 generic characters, is totally destitute of any such dilatation. 



Norops macrodactylus, nob. 

 Char. Scales upon snout tricarinate ; those of supra-orbitar ridges separated 

 from each otlier hjr a row of smaller scales ; twelve rows of dorsal scales dis- 

 tinctly carinated ; scales upon abdomen carinated ; upon flanks very small ; 




1856.] 223 



fingers and toes not dilated ; color white above and upon abdomen ; a lateral 

 vitta passing over the tympanum, extending the whole length of the body. 



Description. Head long and narrow, with a marked depression in front ; 

 nostrils lateral, in a single scale, about a line from the extremity of the snout, 

 with several rows of small scales immediately behind them ; their lower margin 

 is on a line with the exterior ridge projecting over the orbit ; the rostral plate 

 is broad and narrow, its upper margin forming an obtuse angle ; the scales upon 

 the front part of the head are more or less hexagonal, depressed, tricarinate ; 

 the supra-orbitar ridge on each side is composed of a ridge of larger scales, separated 

 from each other hy a row of smaller ones; eight larger scales upon the orbit ; oc- 

 cipital plate quite distinct ; six or seven supra-labials ; 42 teeth in the upper 

 jaw, the eleven or twelve posterior tricarinate ; tongue triangular, smooth, 

 deeply notched behind, very slightly in front, more or less adherent beneath ; 

 scales upon the temples subequal ; auricular opening of moderate size ; body 

 slender, presenting above, twelve rowsof distinctly larger scales; about as broad 

 as long, hexagonal, each with a distinct carina extending its whole length. 

 The scales upon the abdomen, of which from sixteen to eighteen rows may be 

 counted, appear somewhat larger than those upon the back, and are also 

 distinctly carinated; the scales upont he flanks are very small, quadrangular, 

 carinated, presenting a very small spine posteriorly ; extremities slender ; toes 

 not dilated, presenting a row of transverse scales beneath ; tail of moderate 

 length ; a well marked gular pouch in the larger specimen, commencing at the 

 chin and extending upon the abdomen, (in the smaller specimen, probably a fe- 

 male, this is scarcely visible.) 



Coloration. Head, back and upper part of tail white above; abdomen and 

 under part of tail of same color ; the gular fold in the larger specimen is dark 

 colored ; sides brown, white spotted, a lateral white stripe extending from 

 beneath the eye, along the side of the head, immediately above the tym- 

 panum, passing along the side of the neck, about a line above the shoulder, and 

 extending the whole length of the side of the body, and becoming lost upon the 

 tail. The white spots are upon either side of this white lateral line, but in the 

 larger specimen they are absent, and the lateral line is of a brown color and 

 more narrow, the ground color white. 



Dimensions. Length of head 6 lines ; greatest breadth 3 ; length of neck and 

 body to vent 14 lines ; of tail 1 inch 9 lines ; of humerus 3 lines ; of arm 3 lines ; 

 of hand to extremity of longest finger 2\ ; of foot to extremity of longest toe 6 

 lines. Total length 3 inches 5 lines. 



Dimensions of a larger specimen. Length of head 7 lines ; breadth 4 ; length of 



neck and body to vent 1 J inches ; of tail ; of arm 3f lines ; of forearm 



3| ; of hand to extremity of longest finger 3 J lines; of thigh bh lines ; of leg 5| ; 

 of foot to extremity of longest toe 8 J. 



Habitat. New Grenada. Two specimens from the Philadelphia Museum in 

 exchange. 



Gen. Anolis, Daudin, 



Char. " Fingers dilated beneath the anti-penultimate phalanx, forming a 

 sub-oval disk, more or less enlarged, provided with imbricated scaly lamellte ; be- 

 neath the neck a goitre, which when it is not distended assumes the form of a gular 

 pouch more or less developed; palatine teeth, no pores to the thighs." D. & B. 



The genus Anolis is divided by Dumeril and Bibron first into two grand divi- 

 sions, viz., A. with fingers but slightly dilated, constituting the genus Draco- 

 nura of Wagler and Wiegmann This comprises but two species. B. with 

 fingers distinctly dilated, constituting the genus Dactyloa. This latter division 

 includes twenty-three species. These are again subdivided into (a.) species in 

 which the abdomen is provided with flattened scales, smooth or carinated, and 

 for the most part imbricated, of which there are twenty-two, and (/>.) species 

 with the abdominal scales granular, of which there is at present known but 

 one, viz. Anolis camaeleonides. 



The subdivision a. is again divided into species in which the scales of the 




224 ['October, 



sides are much smaller than those of the back and abdomen, (1 sp.) (6.) In 

 which the scales of the sides are of about the same dimension as those of the 

 back and abdomen ; this group is again divided into (a.) species in which the 

 scales upon the upper and lateral parts of the body are mingled with tubercles, 

 (1 sp. loysiana,) and (6.) in which the scales of the upper parts and sides of the 

 body are homogeneous or not mingled with tubercles. This last division com- 

 prises by far the greater number, viz., twenty species. The genus Anolis is 

 exclusively American ; of the twenty-five species described by Dumeril and 

 Bibron, two are from Surinam; five from Cuba, exclusively; one from Cuba and 

 the United States ; one from Cuba and Mexico ; one from Cuba and Jamaica; five 

 from Martinique, exclusively ; one from Martinique and St. Domingo, one 

 from Chili; two from Brazil; two from the West Indies; one from the island 

 of Tortola; one from St. Domingo, exclusively; one from Cayenne, and one of 

 unknown origin. 



Of these twenty-five species of Anolis, Dumeril and Bibron represent 

 at least one half as entirely new, (1837,) with the exception of two or 

 three previously described by Wiegmann. One has since been described (1851,) 

 by Prof. Aug. Dumeril, in the Catalogue Methodique de la Collection des 

 Reptiles des Museum d'histoire Naturelle de Paris. (A. Heterodermus from New 

 Grenada.) 



De la Sagra's work on Cuba contains figures of six species viz., vermi- 

 culatus, Carolinensis, lucius, Sagraei, Loysiana, (A. cantholis,) Fernandina 

 (CamEeliopsis,) (A. camfelionides, D. & B.) Daudin has figured two species 

 viz. : A^ lineatus and punctatus. Anolis velifer is figured in Guerin Iconogra- 

 phic du Fv,egne Animal, Tome 1, pi. 12. The Prince de Wied has figured two 

 species of Anolis, viz.: A. gracilis, (nasicus,D . & B.) and A. viridis, punctatus, 

 Daudin, according to Dumeril and Bibron. 



Among the reptiles belonging to this genus in the collection of the Academy, 

 are several well known species, viz. : Anolis equestris, (5 sp.) A. camaelo- 

 nides, (1.) A. carolinensis, (28 sp.) A. punctatus, (1 sp.) A. Edwardsii, (4 sp.) the 

 last from Jamaica, and others from Cuba, Mexico and Jamaica, which we cannot 

 make out as described in the systems. A number of these were collected in Jamaica 

 at the instigation of my excellent friend. Dr. Caspar W Pennock, and generously 

 presented by him to the Academy, and others by another friend, Dr. Betton, 

 of Germantown. These are the more valuable, inasmuch as the Herpetology of 

 Jamaica appears to be but incompletely known ; but one species of Anolis is 

 described by Mr. Gray as inhabiting that island, viz. : A. stenodactylus. 



Anolis (Draconura, Wieg.) tropidogaster, Nob. 



Char. Head of moderate size, covered in front with elevated scales or tuber- 

 cles of neaily equal size; supraciliary ridges separated from each other by two 

 rows of smaller scales ; four or five large unicarinate scales upon each orbit ; 

 occipital plate not in contact with the supraciliary ridge ; temples covered with 

 small granulations ; middle rows of dorsal scales the largest ; scales upon abdo- 

 men strongly carinated ; color brownish, extremities banded with brown. 



Description. This species of Anolis is readily distinguished by the remarkably 

 strong carination of the ventral scales, being even more strongly carinated than 

 those of A. carolinensis, resembling much the scales of Phrynosoma cornutum. 

 The head is of moderate size, snout not prolonged; the rostral plate is broader 

 than long, rounded above ; the snout is covered with elevated scales or tuber- 

 cles, of nearly equal size ; the scales upon the front are unequal, tricari- 

 nate ; this region presents a marked depression, bounded on each side by an 

 indistinct ridge ; the supraciliary ridge on each side is constituted by a row of Jive large 

 and very distinct plates separated from each other in the middle by two rows of smaller 

 scales ; there is a group of four or five large unicarinate scales upon each orbit, 

 bordered with others of a smaller size, with numerous granulations exteriorly, 

 and a row of very small plates between these large plates and the supraciliary 

 ridge ; occipital plate rather large, irregular in shape, very distinct, separated from the 

 iupraciliary ridges by several rows of smooth scales; nostrils lateral, circular 




1856.] 225 



about a line from the extremity of the snout ; eight small quadrangular plates 

 margin the upper jaw; 4/ teeth may be coanted in the upper jaw, the eleven or 

 twelve posterior on each side tricuspid, the intermaxillary very small, the suc- 

 ceeding ones pointed and conical, and considerably larger. 38-40 teeth in the 

 lower jaw, the twelve posterior tricuspid; tongue triangular, more or less adhe- 

 rent beneath, deeply notched posteriorly ; temples covered with very small granu- 

 lations, a little larger above ; tj^mpanum of moderate size, scales on the flanks 

 small and granular, much smaller than those upon the back, of which the 

 middle rows are the largest; scales of the back carinated, not very dis- 

 tinctly ; those upon the abdomen much larger than those upon the back, quad- 

 rangular, and very strongly carinated; body and extremities slender; a well de- 

 veloped gular pouch ; fingers and toes without any dilatation whatever; third 

 and fourth fingers of equal length, fourth toe much the longest. 



Coloration. Brownish above with a greyish tinge upon the body, extremities 

 banded with brown ; abdomen whitish. 



Dimensions. Length of head, G lines ; greatest breadth, 3 ; length of neck and 

 body to tail, 13 lines ; tail mutilated ; length of forearm, 3J lines ; of arm, 3 lines ; 

 length of thigh, 5 lines ; of leg, 6 ; of hand to extremity of longest finger, 3 

 lines; of foot to extremity of longest toe, TJ lines. An Anolis resplendens, D. & B?

Char. Of moderate size, scales upon supra-orbitar ridges separated from each 

 other by smaller polygonal scales ; from nine to fifteen carinated polyogonal scales 

 upon orbit ; a well marked depression upon the occiput ; occipital scale sepa- 

 rated from supraciliary ridge by four rows of scales ; temples granulated ; ab- 

 dominal scales carinated ; tail much compressed ; color blue or light green, 

 covered above and upon the sides with minute white spots ; total length about 

 inches. 



Description. Nostrils small, subcircular, their anterior margin about J a line 

 from the extremity of the snout ; scales upon front polygonal, carinated ; those 

 upon the supraorbitar ridge large, carinated, separated from each other by smaller 

 polygonal and more or less carinated scales ; from ni7ie to fifteen or more conglomera- 

 rated polygonal carin&ted scales over the orbit, surrounded with granules, the 

 greater number external ; a very well marked depression upon the occiput ; the occi- 

 pital plate, which is smooth, is subcircular, occupying the bottom of the cavity, 

 and is separated from the supra-orbitar ridge by four rows of scales ; seven plates 

 upon the upper jaw, the third or fourth quadrangular, and remarkable for its ex- 

 treme length ;* temples granulated, auricular opening suboval, rather large, 

 its posterior edge minutely denticulated ; no crest upon neck or body ; scales: 

 upon sides granular, those upon back a little larger, especially the three or four rows 

 upon the middle line; scales upon abdomen with rounded posterior margins, im- 

 bricate, carinated, much larger than those upon sides and back ; tail much com- 

 pressed, larger than head, neck and body, verticillate, covered with carinated 

 scales, the four or five inferior rows much the largest, its superior and inferior 

 margins denticulated ; from sixteen to nineteen lateral rows of verticillate scales 

 may be counted, larger than the rest, the posterior extremity of the tail being 

 destitute of them ; scales along superior border of thighs and forearms very dis- 

 tinctly carinated ; a longitudinal fold under the throat. 



Coloration. Snout, front and sides of head whitish, with a tinge of yellow ; 

 body above and upon the sides light blue, (probably green during life,) covered 

 all over with white spots ; tail yellowish ; no black marks or lines upon the 

 body. 



Dimensions. Length of head 9 lines ; greatest breadth 5; length of body to vent 

 \\ inches; of anterior extremities to extremity of longest finger 1 inch ; of pos- 

 terior to extremity of longest toe 1 inch 9 lines; of tail 4^ inches ; total length

226 [October, 



Habitat. Jamaica, Three specimens, two adult and one young presented by 

 Dr. Betton, 



Gen. Remarks. This species, although it might, with some propriety, be named 

 punctatus, from the great number of small white spots with which it is covered, 

 differs entirely in appearance from the punctatus of Daudiu, of which we have 

 one specimen from Surinam. The head in punctatus is much longer, the neck 

 more contracted and the body and tail longer. The scales on the front of the 

 head are smooth in punctatus, carinated in punctatissimus, and their shape and 

 general arrangement are very different; the row of plates above the supra-labials 

 are larger in the former species ; the scales upon the flanks are oblong in punc- 

 tatus, those upon the back flattened ; the tail is altogether difi'erent ; it is sub- 

 round in punctatus, with smooth scales, without verticillse, and the much larger 

 row of scales along the median line. The one is an inhabitant of Jamaica the 

 other of Surinam and Brazil.

Char. Of larger size than usual among the smaller species of Anolis ; head 

 much depressed in front, covered with large and smooth polygonal scales ; 

 scales of supra orbitar ridge in contact at the middle ; temples covered with 

 polygonal scales ; upon sides suboval, smooth, larger than those upon back and 

 abdomen, interspaces filled with small granules; abdominal scales smooth; no 

 dorsal crest ; tail compressed cyclo-tetragonal at base ; color whitish with 

 blotches of green. 



Description. Head long and narrow, depressed in front, where it is covered 

 with large and smooth scales, much larger than in most other species of Anolis ; 

 scales upon the snout on the contrary very small ; nostrils small, suboval, their 

 anterior margin a line from the extremity of the snout, situated on the side of a 

 slight prominence, just within the ridge extending from the anterior margin of 

 the orbit to below the nostril and terminating at its anterior border ; the supra- 

 orbitar ridge is composed of four or live large scales ; they are in contact at their 

 middle, but not anteriorly or posteriorly ; the supra-orbitar ridge is not prolonged 

 anteriorly, the front, as before stated, being covered with smooth and large scales; 

 differing more or less in shape; ten or eleven quadrilateral plates may be 

 counted upon the margin of the upper jaw, 44 teeth in the lower, the ten an- 

 terior on each side pointed, the 12 posterior tricuspid ; 36 in the upper, eighteen 

 on each side, the ten anterior pointed, the rest tricuspid ; tongue slender, deeply 

 notched posteriorly, entire in front, three rows of smooth scales upon the side 

 of the head, between the supra-orbitar plates and the anterior orbitar ridge ; 

 temples covered with smooth polygonal scales, the .ntperior and posterior roics the largest; 

 auricular openings of moderate size, suboval, not denticulated ; scales upon the 

 sides suboval, smooth, separated from each other, the interspaces /died with small 

 granides ; these lateral scales are larger than those upon the back and abdomen; 

 those upon the neck and back are more closely united ; subround or polygonal ; 

 those upon the abdomen for the most part quadrangular, perfectly smooth ; no 

 crest upon the back or neck ; a large goitre extending from the chin as far as the 

 abdomen ; a veiy large portion of its surface w]\en distended appears to be desti- 

 tute of scales ; the scales upon the under part of the thighs and in front of 

 the arms, as well as upon the under part of the anterior extremities are quite 

 small, having the appearance of granulations ; those along the superior margin 

 of the thighs are quite large. Extremities slender; tail cyclo-tetragonal at base, 

 compressed in the rest of its extent; longer than head, neck and body, slightly 

 denticulated above, verticillate, seven distinct vertical rows of scales larger 

 than the rest; four or five rows upon the under part of the tail strongly cari- 

 nated.

 with a shade of green ; throat yellowish white ; in another and smaller specimen 

 the white is more pure and the blotches brown. 



Dimensions. Length of head 8 lines ; greatest breadth 5 lines ; length of body

2 inches 9 lines ; of anterior extremities 9 lines ; of posterior extremities 1 inch ; 

 of tail 3J inches ; total length 6 inches and ^. 



Habitat. Jamaica. One specimen presented by Dr. Caspar W. Pennock, the 

 other without a label. 



Gen. Remarks. The scaling of the frontal region is so entirely different from 

 that of the other species of Anolis being composed of flat and large polygonal 

 plates, that with the large size of the scales upon the sides of the body, larger 

 than those upon the back and abdomen, being just the reverse of what obtains 

 in most of the other species of Anolis, it might, with some degree of propriety be 

 considered as belonging to a subgenus ; but as the multiplication of subgenera in 

 our opinion tends only to confusion, and to discourage the young naturalist, 

 and is in fact, at variance with a true and philosophical study of nature, we pre- 

 fer not making one, leaving it to be placed in a group different from those already 

 recognized, viz , with scales upon the sides larger i\\a.xi those upon the back and 

 abdomen, and larger and flat plates upon the head. 



There can be no doubt, we think, that Anolis leucocephalus is a species new 

 to Herpetology, the only one closely approaching it being that recently described 

 by Prof. Aug. Dumeril, in his Catalogue Methodique de la Collection des Reptiles 

 du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris, p. 59. (Anolis heterodermus, A. Dum.) 

 who observes that the only species of Anolis previously described with scales 

 upon the sides, surrounded with small granulations is the Anolis camajleonides 

 or Chamelopsis Fernandina of Cocteau figured in de la Sagra's splendid work ou 

 the Natural History of Cuba. Mr. Dumeril's species is found in New Granada, 

 and differs from leucocephalus in having a small denticulated carina upon 

 the neck and back, in its carinated scales upon the tail, in the absence of a 

 large goitre, and the presence of the voluminous scales upon the supra-orbitar 

 ridges, and the margins of the snout.

 about three-fourths of a line from the extremity of the snout ; nostrils lateral, 

 situated upon the side of a slight prominence ; supra-orbitar ridge composed of 

 four or five scales, of which the anterior one is much the largest; this ridge is 

 continuous with a curvilinear one upon the front, unitirg with that of the oppo- 

 site side at the posterior extremity of the snout, at its middle forming the ex- 

 ternal boundaries of a slight depression upon the front, at the bottom of which 

 are several smaller scales; scales upon the muzzle smaller than those upon the 

 from, tri-carinate ; seven supra-orbitar scales, four of them quite large, sepa-

JIahilat. Cienfuegos, Cuba. Two specimens presented by Capt. Baker. 



In a smaller but more perfect specimen, the tail is longer than the head, neck 

 and body, the former being 1 inch 4 lines in length, the latter 1 inch 8 lines, 

 compressed laterally ; in its posterior half very slender, almost filamentary. 



Dimensions of a larger specimen. Length of head 7 lines ; greatest breadth 4 

 lines ; length of body to vent 1 inch ^ lines ; tail mutilated The coloration of 

 this specimen is whitish, with narrow br -wn interrupted bands upon the neck, 

 with brownish longitudinal bands along the flanks, and transverse white spots 

 and fascite ; extrenaities banded with browa above; under parts white without 

 spots; in another there are dark triangular spots which coalesce upon the tail 




230 [October, 



including hexagonal patches of white; extremities banded with olive, under 

 parts white. Habitat the same. The specimens thus marked are probably the 

 young, and we are inclined to think are, as well as the larger brown-colored 

 specimens, identical with Anolis Sagraei. 



Another specimen of intermediate size, characterized by the same difference 

 in form of the scales and granulations upon the temples, tricarinate scales upon 

 the front and muzzle, and carinated scales upon the back and abdomen, prpsents 

 a coloration very much resembling that of fig. 2, in pi. xiii. of De la Sgra's 

 work, viz., on each side of the body and tail a row of dark-coloied undulated 

 markings, and dark-colored bands upon the extremities ; but the scales upon 

 the head and body in this figure are not represented as carinated. In Sagraei, 

 as before mentioned, the supra-orbitar ridges are represented by Dumeiil 

 and Bibron to be in contact; but in the text of De la Sagra's work, they are 

 represented to be separated by a single row of scales ; in our specimens we find 

 one intermediate row of large scales, or two smaller rows, one of which is more 

 or less imperfect. 



Anolis heterolepis, nob. 



Among the specimens in the collection of the Academy is one which at first, 

 from the triangular markings upon the back, I supposed to be the young of the 

 preceding species, but on a closer examination I find that it differs very materi- 

 ally in the following parliculars : 1st. The snout is evidently less acute, more 

 depressed, and is covered with smaller scales; the scales between the supra- 

 orbitar ridges anteriorly are much smaller, there being but two rows in Sagraei 

 and five in the species now under consideration ; the occipital plate is larger ; the 

 granulations upon the flanks are much smaller and smooth instead of being cari- 

 nated, and the ventral scales are smooth, whereas in Sagraji they are very dis- 

 tinctly carinated. The tail is considerably longer than the head, neck and body, 

 cyclo-tetragonal at base, compressed in the greater part of its extent, quite slender 

 posteriorly, with transverse rows of larger scales resembling verticillae, about a 

 line apart; the three or four rows of scales beneath much larger than the others 

 and strongly carinated. The present species differs also in a marked manner 

 from Sagraei in having the plate immediately beneath the first infra-labiaf and 

 behind the mental, much smaller,* this plate being remarkably large in Sagraei 

 and in having the scales upon the chin between the inframaxillary rows of scales 

 much smaller. We propose for this species the name of Anolis heterolepis. 

 It is at once distinguished from angusticeps by the long and narrow head of the 

 latter. 



Coloration. Light pea green above, with triangular spots of a deeper shade 

 on each side of the median line of the back, the apices t'luching each other; 

 chin and throat marked with green, presenting in the latter region irregularly 

 longitudinal lines ; somewhat similar markings upon the occiput, and a green 

 colored blotch upon each temple ; under parts of body and extremities white with 

 a tinge of green, more marked upon the abdomen. 



Dimensions. Length of head 6^ ''nes ; greatest breadth SJ ; length of neck 

 and body to vent 13 lines; of tail 2 inches 9 lines. Total length 4 inches 4.} 

 lines. 



Habitat. Cienfuegos, Cuba. One specimen, presented by Capt,, Baker. 



Adienda. In comparing the different species of Anolis above described viith 

 each other, the following remarks may aid in their future determination : 

 equestris, camitleonides, Edwardsii and Carolinensis, are so distinctly charac- 

 terized as to be readily recognized from the descriptions of authors, more 

 especially of Dumerii and Bibron, the admirable descriptions of Bibron of these 

 and the many other species throughout the work being beyond all praise. In 

 xericeus the middle dorsal rows of scales are not sensibly larg r than the others, 

 and there is no larger row of scales along the middle line of the tail above ; the 



*This plate is also small in A. sericeus. 




1856.] 231 



tail is round -in Sagrfei it is high and very much compressed, with a dorsal row 

 of larger scales. In acutus the scales upon the abdomen are indistinctly cari- 

 nated, in tropidogaster strongly; the scales upon the frontal region are smooth 

 in acutus, tricarinate in tropidogaster ; tbe supraciiiary ridges are closely in 

 contact in acutus, separated by two rows of scales in tropidogaster. But 

 although these species resemble each other much in color, the most marked 

 point of difference is in the toes, wbich are dilated in acutus, as they most com- 

 monly are in the genus Anolis, but not in tropidogaster. Angusliceps is 

 readily recognized by its small size and narrow head ; heterolepis, by its smooth 

 ventral scales and triangular markirgs, and the arrangement of scales upon the 

 temples, which are composed of granulations and larger scales, as in Sagraei. 

 The two median dorsal rows of scales in acutus are sensibly larger than the 

 others, and the two plates behind the mental, beneath the first and second or 

 pre-labials, broader than those which succeed them. 



After a careful comparison of the descriptions of the species in Dumeril and 

 Bibron, I do not find any which present the saujc characters as those given 

 above. Besides these, Mr. Gray has described seven species, viz. : A. occipi- 

 talis, porcatus, flavescens, lineatopus, stenodactylus, reticulatus, aeneus. Of 

 these the habitat of porcatus is Cuba ; that of aeneus, tropical America. Of the 

 species of which an account is given by me, the most remarkable is A. leuco- 

 cephalus, from the anomalous form of the plates upon the head and the scales 

 upon the body, those upon the sides contrary to what usually obtains, being 

 much larger than those upon the back and abdomen. 



Anolis alligator, Dum. et Bib. 



Char. Head resembling closely that of Alligator; supra-orbitar ridges closely 

 in contact; occipital pla'e in contact with the supra-orbitar ridge; scales upon 

 temples ot unequal size, with an anterior marginal row of larger scales; two or 

 three middle dorsal rows of scales larger than the others; small granules inter- 

 spersed between the scales upon tbe body ; ventral scales smooth ; no dorsal or 

 caudal crest; tail slender, slightly compressed at its middle ; color dark bluish, 

 with black maculaiions; a black spot beneath each axilla.

 ridged, with a depression in the middle, covered as well as the muzzle with 

 rough but not carinated scales ; rostral broad and narrow ; immediately behind 

 it two large quadrangular plates, with a smaller one between ; posterior to this 

 transverse row two longitudinal rows of quadrangular plates ; front covered 

 with polygonal plates of unequal size, many of them quite large; nostrils large, 

 subeircular, rather more than half a line from the extremity of the snout, situ- 

 ated within the continuation of the supra-orbitar ridge, at the anterior extremity 

 of a slight prominence ; supra-orbitar ridge composed of five large plates, rough, 

 but not carinated, with two smaller ones bebiud the anterior by far the largest; 

 the two ridges closely in contact; from five to eight or nine supra-orbitar plates 

 not carinated, separated from the supra-orbitar ridge by a single row of small 

 scales; occipital plate urceolate, with large scales laterally, smaller ones behind, i?i 

 contact in front with the supra-orbitar ridges; eight quadrilateral plates margin 

 the upper jaw on each side ; three rows of scales above the marginal plates, in 

 front of the orbit, the inferior the largest ; scales upon the temples of very unequal 

 size, with a distinct anterior marginal row of larger scales ; auricular openings rather 

 large, denticulated ; body rather stout, covered above with scales elevated in the 

 middle, but not carinated; the two or three middle rows a little longer than the others ; 

 scales upon the flanks smaller than those upon the back, but not granulated ; each scale 

 upon thz body is surrounded by very small and scattered granulations, resembling in 

 size, though not so closely approximated as in Varanus ; ventral scales smooth, larger 

 considerably than those upon the body, rounded posteriorly ; no crest upon neck 

 or back; tail longer than head, neck and body, thick at base, slightly compressed 

 at its middle, very slender except toward base, covered with carinated scales ; 

 above a large median row, almost smooth beneath, and of nearly equal size in 

 tho specimen examined, except five or six rows ou each side, about 5J lines 




232 [October, 



from the anus ; scales upon the upper part of the thighs very slightly carinated, 

 some of them with a double carina; a pular fold. 



Coloration. Above bluish, with black maculae ; under parts lighter, with a 

 tinge of yellow and ferruginous; a black spot beneath each axilla. 



Dimensions. Length of head 8 lines; greatest breadth 5 lines; length of body 

 to vent 1 inch 7 lines; of tail 2 inches 9 lines. Total length 4 inches. 



Habitat. Unknown. One specimen in Museum, belonging to the Green Col- 

 lection, presented by Dr. Bache. 



Gen. Remarks. This species differs from Carolinensis in the less prolonged 

 snout, the absence of the well-marked ridges upon it, the juxtaposition of the 

 supra-orbitar ridges, th** smooth ventral scales, and in its mode of coloration. 

 The specimen described by Dumeril and Bibron was found in Martinique. The 

 general resemblance of the head to that of Alligator i> quite striking. Accord- 

 ing to Dumeril and Bibron, who have given an excellent description of this 

 animal, the black markings under the axillae are constant, 



Anolis Carolinensis. 



We have twenty-eight specimens of Anolis Carolinensis from Cuba and the 

 southero portion of the United States. These evidently belong to the same spe- 

 cies ; the specimens differ more or less in color, some being of a beautiful bright 

 green with scarcely any spots, others more or less spotted and lined upon the 

 back, throat and under part of the tail ; nearly all have the dark-colored spot 

 upon the temple ; three or four of the specimens have a broad white band with 

 irrfgnlar edges upon the middle line of the back, constituting a well-marked 

 Yariety. 



Habits The following remarks in regard to the habits of these interesting 

 animals have been communicated to me by a friend in the South, who has had 

 ample opportunities of observing them carefully : 



1st. That the}' drink frequently. 



2d. That when they shed they uniformly swallow their exuvias. 



3d. That when they happen to break their caudal appendage it is renewed. 

 The growth of the tail, it appears, is more rapid after the broken ends have 

 united. I have myself had for a long time several of these beautiful creatures 

 alive, and they became so tame as whenever a drop of water was presented to 

 them upon the tip of the finger, to leave the part of the twig on which they hap- 

 pened to be and eagerly run up after it, protruding their tongues and lapping 

 very much after the manner of the dog. They change their color, frequently 

 being sometimes more or less brown, but are usually of a light and beautiful 

 pea green. Their favorite food appeared to be flies, which they devoured 

 greedily. 



Gen. BRACHYSAURUS, nob. 



Char. Head short, covered above with polygonal flattened plates of unequal 

 size; nostrils tubular, in a single plate, near its posterior margin; no distinct 

 occipital plate ; a row of broad hexagonal scales over each orbit ; a row of large 

 and smooth plates upon the side of the head ; no transverse folds upon the neck ; 

 scales upon back, sides and abdomen carinated ; the dorsal and middle row 

 larger than the others, tectiform ; no pores upon thighs or in front of anus. 



B. EUYTHROGASTER, nob. 



Description. The head is of moderate size, short and thick, rounded above, 

 longer than broad, covered above with polygonal scales of unequal size, uni- 

 carinate ; the rostral plate is broad and narrow, very slightly elevated ; imme- 

 diately behind it arc two triangular plates, with a larger one between them ; the 

 nostrils are circular, looking backward and upward, situated near the posterior 

 margin of a quadrangular plate ; the supra-orbitar ridge on each side is consti- 

 tuted by a row of polygonal scales of unequal size, seven in number, in contact 

 at their middle, there being no intermediate longitudinal row of scales ; between 

 the two posterior scales of the supra-orbitar ridges are two large quadrangular 




1856.] 233 



scales, with a broad pentagonal one behind them ; a few small scales between 

 the large snpra-orbitar plates four or five in number and the supraciliary 

 ridge ; five or six narrow quadrangular supra-labial plates, the fourth the longest ; 

 a long and smooth plate below the orbit, in front of it five others, the second, 

 counting from the nostril, the highest, the first immediately below the nasal 

 plate ; beneath these plates and above the supra-labials a row of smaller plates; 

 eyelids covered with granulations; mental plate triangular, five or six inferior 

 labials ; 36 teeth in the upper jaw, the seven or eight posterior tricuspid, the 

 others pointed, conical, the anterior quite small; 40 in the lower, the twelve last 

 tricuspid; a row of small palatine teeth, one on each side ; tongue triangular, 

 smooth above, deeply notched posteriorly, very slightly so in front; tympanum 

 circular, of moderate size, somewhat depressed ; neck slightly folded upon its 

 sides; body moderately robust, covered for the most part with large scales 

 broader'than long, unicarinate, the carinae strongly developed ; the median 

 dorsal row larger than the others, tectiform ; extremities slender, covered with 

 carinated scales ; third and fourth fingers of equal length ; fourth .toe much the 

 longest ; tail cyclo-tetragonal at base ; no femoral and no anal pores. 



Coloration. Greyish white above, upon head, back and extremities brownish; 

 beneath of same color, except upon chin and throat and sides of abdomen, which 

 are of a beautiful pink red color. 



Dimensions. Length of head 8 lines ; greatest breadth 6 ; length of neck and 



body to vent 1 inch 8 lines ; of tail ; of humerus 5 lines ; of forearm 4 



lines ; of hand to extremity of longest finger 6 lines ; of femur 6 lines ; of tibia 

 7 lines ; of foot to extremity of longest toe 1 inch. 



Ilabitat. New Grenada. One specimen received from Philadelphia Museum 

 in exchange. 



Gen. Remarks. The genus above characterized differs from Sceloporus, among 

 other particulars in being destitute of femoral pores, in the presence of the row 

 of larger scales along the median line of the back, and in the scaling of the 

 head ; from Proctrotretus, in having carinated and not smooth scales upon the 

 abdomen, as well as in the two last mentioned particulars. In Ophryessa, in 

 Enyalius, Wagl., and in Microlophus, there is a larger row of scales along the 

 median line of the back, and in Dipso-saurus also, to which it has little or no 

 other resemblance ; but in Ophryessa the scaling of the head is quite different, 

 presenting numerous small and rough polygonal tubercles above ; the scales 

 upon the back are not so broad, and are much more strongly carinated. Ophry- 

 essa is a much larger animal, and has a well marked though not elevated crest. 



Gen. PROCTROTRETUS, Dumeril et Bibron. 



Char. Head subpyramido-quadrangular, more or less depressed, cephalic 

 plates moderate, polygonal, occipital in general not very distinct; palatine teeth ; 

 neck folded upon the sides, or entirely simple; tympanic membrane slightly de- 

 pressed ; body rounded or slightly depressed, covered with imbricated scales, 

 the superior carinated, the inferior smooth ; neither caudal nor dorsal crest ; 

 toes simple ; tail long and conical, or moderate, slightly depressed ; no femoral 

 pores ; anal pores in the males. D. & B. 



Proctrotretus niger, nob. 



Char. Of small size; color black or dark brown above. Scales of moderate 

 dimensions, quadrangular, strongly carinated, the margin of the scales distinct; 

 a fold upon the side of the neck, bifurcating anteriorly ; temples covered with 

 scales ; post-auricular regions with granulations, and sides of the neck with 

 small scales ; a single row of plates above the supra-labials ; posterior surface of 

 thighs granulated. 



Description. Head small, depressed, with a rather acute snout, covered above 

 with polj'gonal, unequal scales, not carinated ; immediately behind the rostral 

 are three plates, the two external much more extended transversely than the 

 middle ; behind these are three others, the two lateral more extended longitu- 

 dinally, and more narrow than the middle one ; exterior to these lateral plates, 




234 [October, 



and between Ihem and the nasal, are two small quadrilateral ones ; immediately 

 behind the middle of the three plates described is a large heptagonal one, with 

 a quadrangular plate situated obliquely, and much mure broad than long, on 

 each side, in contact with iis antero-lateral facet; on the left side this contact is 

 interrupted by a small supplementary quadrangular plate ; the large hexagonal 

 plate occupies the middle of the frontal region, and lies between the two large 

 quadrangular plates, constituting the anterior extremity of the supraciliary ridge ; 

 this ridge is composed of eight plates, more or less quadrangular, in contact in 

 the middle, the upper surface of each plate, as well as that of the other plates 

 of the head, presenting numerous vermiculations ; the nostrils are subcircular, 

 each in a single plate, nearer its posterior margin ; immediately behind the nasal 

 is a very small plate, and immediately below it another, but larger, between it 

 and the single row of plates above the supra-labials ; posterior to these two 

 plates are five others of unequal size, occupying the interspace between those 

 just mentioned, and the anterior inferior margin of the orbit ; of these the upper- 

 most is the largest; there are five superior labials ; the superior surface of the 

 orbits is protected by numerous plates, of which two rows are conspicuously 

 larger than the others, the innermost, the most extended transversely, consisting 

 of four or five large plates, more or less vermiculated upon their upper surface ; 

 the external superior border of the orbit is composed of narrow longitudinal 

 plates placed one above another ; body slender, covered above and upon the 

 sides with 33 rows of quadrangular carinated scales, the carinse very distinct, 

 those upon the back the strongest, arranged in ten longitudinal and parallel 

 rows, each carina running along the middle of the scale, the margins of which 

 are well defined, but not extending in a point beyond it ; auricular opening 

 rather large, a few scales in front; temples covered with scales; a fold upon the 

 neck, bifurcating in front ; post-auricular region granulated ; immediately pos- 

 terior to the mental are three or four large and more or less quadrangular plates; 

 extremities slender, upper surface covered with carinated scales ; posterior sur- 

 face of thighs granulated, tail of moderate length, longer than head, neck and 

 body tapering to a point, cyclo-tetragonal at base ; posterior margin of anus 

 granulated, the scales immediately behind the granulations smooth ; scales of 

 chin, throat, abdomen and under surface of extremities smooth ; no transverse 

 fold upon neck; no pores in front of the anus. 



Coloration. Very dark brown, or black above; a very narrow and somewhat 

 indistinct yellow band, commencing at the axilla and extending along the 

 flanks; a broader brownish one and less distinct above; under parts bluish 

 mingled with copper color, with metallic reflections; chin and throat con- 

 spicuously black, spotted, the larger spots in front; minute black dots distributed 

 over abdomen and under surface of extremities. 



Dimensions. Length of head 4.} lines; greatest breadth 2| lines; length of 

 neck and body 1 inch; of tail 1 inch 9 lines; of arm 2 lines; of forearm 2 lines; 

 of hand to extremity of longest finger 3 lines; of thigh 2| lines; of leg 3 lines; 

 of foot to extremity of longest toe 6 lines; of tail 1| inch. Total length 3 inches 

 IJ line. 



Hab. Quinquina Island. A single specimen, presented by W. W. Ruschen- 

 berger, M.D., U.S.N. 



Gen. Remarks. The scales in this species are much smaller than in Proctro- 

 tretus nigro-maculatus, Wiegmanni, pictus or Ohilensis, being about the size of 

 those of P. tenuis, but quite different in shape. It is perhaps the smallest of 

 the Proctrotretes, and is very readily recognized. 



ECPHYMOTES, Cuvier. 



ECPHYMOTES TORQUATUS. 



A femalS specimen of Ecphymotes torquatus from Buenos Ayres, presented by 

 Dr. A. Kennedy, presents the following appearances, in which it differs from those 

 described. The rostral plate is more extended transversely and is less high ; 

 immediately behind the rostral are two large subquadrate plates instead of four 




1856.] 235 



much smaller, and behind these two large subtriangular ones, resembling verj 

 much the anterior frontals in many species of serpents ; these are separated 

 from the rostral by two narrow plates on each side; posterior to these is a trans- 

 verse row of five plates, the two external subequal, the middle one long and 

 hexagonal. 



Coloration. The black vertical band in front of the shoulder exists, but is not 

 seen upon the upper part of the neck; the general color is olive, without spots 

 or markings distinctly visible ; anterior extremities banded in front; no brown 

 marks in front of the anus or upon thighs, these portions of the animal as well 

 as under part of tail being white without any spots whatever. The specimen is 

 largely distended with eggs, one of which measures eight lines in length by five 

 and a half in breadth. A younger specimen from the same locality is more or 

 less spotted with black upon the back, the spots assuming somewhat the form 

 of narrow irregular interrupted bands, upon a ground color of olive ; extremities 

 and tail black spotted, inner part of thighs and tail white ; black band of neck 

 interrupted in the middle. The plates upon the head in this younger specimen 

 are arranged in the following manner : Four in a transverse row immediately 

 behiad the rostral; then two large quadrangular plates ; then a transverse row 

 of five, posterior to which is another row of larger plates, the two exterior 

 forming part of the supra-orbitar ridge. 



URODELA, Dumeril. 



Heredia oregonensis, Girard. 



We received a few days ago, with a collection of Crustaceans and Fishes from 

 California, a specimen of a Caducibranchiate Urodele, which appeared to me 

 to me new, and for which it occurred to me the name Heteroglossa might be 

 proper to distinguish it from the ordinary Bolitoglossidse ; but in looking into 

 tbe last number of the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences, I find a 

 description of a specimen from Oregon, by Mr. C. Girard, which corresponds in 

 so many particulars with it, the chief point of difference being the length of the 

 tail, which is represented as being longer than the head and body, that I hesitate 

 to consider it as new. 



Gen. char. Maxillary teeth small ; two longitudinal patches of sphenoidal 

 teeth, diverging posteriorly, arranged in oblique rows ; a curvilinear series of 

 Tomero-pahitine teeth on each side, almost in contact posteriorly, pHSsing be- 

 tween the posterior nares and the anterior margin of the orbit, separated from 

 the sphenoidal by an interspace without tee-th ; tongue supported by a cylin- 

 drical pedicel, attached in front ; free posteriorly and at the sides ; no parotids ; 

 toes 4 5. 



Sp. char. Size moderate; tail cylindrical; color olive, or brownish yellow, 

 minutely spotted with black above and upon the flanks ; under parts Indian 

 yellow. 



Description. Head broader than body, truncate anteriorly, nostrils small and 

 wide apart, about half a line from the margin of the upper jaw ; eyes prominent, 

 pupil elliptical ; gape of the mouth linear throughout the greatest part of its 

 extent ; no parotids ; no lateral lines of pores along the body ; a transverse fold 

 across the neck; maxillary teeth quite small, internal nares of moderate size, 

 ovoid, a series of vomero-palatine teeth on each side meeting posteriorly, pre- 

 senting the form of an arch, the convexity forward, passing immediately behind 

 the internal nasal opening, between it and the anterior border of the orbit, ex- 

 tending about three-fourths of a line beyond the external margin of the nasal 

 foramen. Two patches of longitudinal sphenoidal teeth, meeting in front, but 

 diverging posteriorly, leaving an interspace in the shape of the letter V reversed ; 

 the teeth in these patches are arranged in oblique rows, converging on each 

 side toward the longitudinal interspace between them, and are not closely set; 

 the tongue is obcordate, entire, longer than broad, supported upon a central 

 cylindrical pedicel as in the mushroom-tongued Urodeles, hut is attached in front 

 at the tip, and by a semi-transparent membrane along its middle as far as the 




236 [October, 



pedicel, the posterior portion and sides being free ; body and extremities slender ; 

 four fingers and five toes ; first finger very short, the third the longest ; first toe 

 quite short, considerably shorter than the fifth, third and fourth of about equal 

 length; two well marked tubercles ujion the palms of the hands, the one at the 

 base of the first, the other at the base of the fifth finger; none are observed 

 upon the toes ; tail tapering, cylindrical, slightly compressed, not so long 

 as head, neck and body. 



Coloration. Brownish above, but on close inspection with a magnifying glass, 

 the whole surface appears to be covered with minute black points upon an olive 

 ground ; the sides are also minutely punctated with black; under parts Indian 

 yellow, without spots. 



Dimensions. Length of head 5 lines; greatest breadth 4; length of neck and 

 body to veut 1 inch 7 lines ; length of tail 1 inch 7 lines ; total length 3 inches 

 7 lines. 



Habitat California? (This Urodele was sent from California without indica- 

 tion of locality, it may therefore have been found in Oregon.) One specimen 

 presented by Mr. George B. Davidson, of the U. C. Survey.' 



Oen, Remarks. This remarkable Urodele differs greatly in the arrangement of 

 its teeth from Aneides, the rows of which are closely approximated and thickly 

 set, (Fam. Plethodontida3,) but resembles more closely Spelerpes, but differs 

 from it more especially in the tongue being tied down anteriorly, whereas in 

 the ordinary Bolitoglossidaj it is mushroom-shaped, as the name indicates, and 

 free all around ; the tongue in the Bolitoglossidae is for the most part entire, 

 (in lon^icauda it is notched posteriorly,) but the minute arrangement of the 

 sphenoidal teeth is different. This animal would appear to belong to the group 

 Ensatinina of Mr. Gray, but in Triton ensatus (Ensatina Escholtzii, Gray,) there 

 are no sphenoidal teeth. 



Appmdix. Since the above was written my attention has been directed by 

 P. L. Sclater, Esq., of the Zoological Society of London, to the work of Mr. Gosse, 

 entitled a Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica, by Philip Henry Gosse, F. L. S., &c., 

 London, 1851, in which I find descriptions of the species of Anolis, iodurus and 

 opalinus, (see also Annals and Magazine of Natural History, second series, 

 1850, p. 344, 345.) Anolis leucocephalus is identical with Placopsis ocellata ; 

 Gosse, p. 346. Besides the above, Mr. Gosse has described another species of 

 Anolis inhabiting Jamaica, viz., Draconura catenata, and two species of Spbajrio- 

 dactylus, viz., S. argus and oxyrhinus. The author gives a very interesting 

 account of the habits of the two species iodurus and opalinus described by him 

 (p. 220, 227.) A figure is also given of Anolis, (Dactyloa) Edwardsii, pi. iv. 

 The, reptiles of Jamaica appear for the most part to be specifically distinct from 

 those of Cuba. The following is a comparative list of those enumerated by 

 Dumeril and Bibron, Mr. Gray, Mr. Gosse, and others, including those described 

 or mentioned in this paper. To these 1 have added a list of the reptiles of Mar- 

 tinique, for the habitat of which I am indebted to Dumeril and Bibron.

238 [OCTOBER; 



Hence it would appear, that with the exception of Emys decussata, Crocodilus 

 acutus, Spb.-Briodactylus sputator, Anolis Sagrsi, Leionotus maculatus, Dro- 

 micus aatillensis, and Typhlops lumbricalis, unless several of the others have 

 been incorrectly determined, the species belonging to the Islands Jamaica and 

 Cuba, although but 90 miles distant, are altogether different, and that several 

 of the genera vyhich exist in the one are wanting in the other. Besides the 

 above we have in our collection a small serpent of the size of a Calamarian, 

 with a very short and broad frontal (vertical) plate, a large pre-ocular, no loral 

 and broad gastrostega, carinated scales and a double row of black spots along 

 the back, from Jamaica, included in the donation of Dr. Penrock, which is 

 identical with Storeria DeKayi, B. & G. (Ischognathus DeKayi, Dum. et Bib.* 

 With the exception of Anolis Carolinensis, the reptiles of Cuba differ in their 

 species altogether from those of the United States, even the southern portion of 

 it; and not only so, but with the exception of Emys, Hylodes and Bufo, and 

 perhaps Ischognathus, there does not appear to be even a genus common to the 

 two countries. Were the Herpetology of each of the West India Islands 

 fully known and very accurately determined, many highly interesting and 

 important facts would be developed, tending much to elucidate the laws which 

 govern the geographical distribution of species.

Five specimens of Emys pseudo-grographica, (young.) The shell of the 

 largest of these specimens measures two and a half inches in length, by two 

 inches, five lines in breadth, and is almost orbicular; the carinse upon the ver- 

 tebral plates are very distinct. Color of carapax olive, with orange colored con- 

 centric and irregular lines, most conspicuous when the epidermis is removed ; 

 an areola towards the posterior margin of each of the plates ; sternum yellowish, 

 marked with irregular dark colored lines ; extremities and head and neck marked 

 with longitudinal lines of yellow and black ; a curvilinear transverse yellow band 

 on each side, behind the eyes continuous with one running down the neck, and 

 a longitutinal one between the eyes ; 24 marginal plates. This species, according 

 to Prof. Holbrook, is found in many of the rivers that empty into the Mississippi, 

 but never east of the Alleghanies. 



Ord. SAURIA, Brogn. 

 Fam. Iguanidje. 



Three specimens of Crotaphytus coUaris, Holb. 



These differ from those from the Creek boundary presented by Dr. Woodhouse, 

 and another large specimen in the collection of the Academy from Arkansas, in 

 wanting the numerous spots with which the latter are covered. The black 

 bands upon the neck and between the shoulders are very distinct ; the general 

 color above is blue, more or less deep, with a tinge of green, with transverse 

 bands of white upon the body and tail; deeper bands of blue upon the posterior 

 extremities; under parts white, with dark colored markings under the chin in 

 two of the young; the plates upon the front in all the specimens are, for the 

 most part larger than those upon the muzzle ; those constituting the semi- circular 

 ridges along the internal margin of the orbit quite large ; occipital plate distinct ; 



*This species has a wide range, being found in Massachusetts and Georgia. 

 Dumeril and Bibron say they have received a specimen from Mexico. 




1856.] 239 



many of the plates (11 or 12,) upon the orbits are much larger than the rest; this 

 difference exists also in the Creek boundary specimens, but is not so well 

 marked; femoral pores very distinct ; these in some of the Creek boundary 

 specimens are very large, (J a line in diameter,) much larger than in any speci- 

 men of'Sceloporus I have seen ; eight eggs quite large, from eight to nine lines in 

 length, were counted in the ovaries of the largest ; in which also the femoral 

 pores were very distinct, so that the femoral pores do not belong exclusively to the 

 male in Crotaphytus ; the stomach which is a large and rounded sac was dis- 

 tended with the debris of grasshoppers and coleopterous insects ; one of the 

 former nearly entire. 



Habitat. Arkansas, Louisiana near the confines of Texas, Western Texas, 

 Kansas. 



The two specimens of Holbrookia maculata (Cophosaurus Troschel) do not 

 differ very materially from the many specimens we have from the Creek and 

 Cherokee countries presented by Dr. Woodhouse ; the marginal plates upon the 

 upper jaw constituting the delicate fluting in that region are more narrow, and 

 the markings upon the back are more regularly disposed, and the white spots are 

 much less Dumcrous than in some of the Creek specimens. The plates upon the 

 head will be found to vary considerably in individual form and arrangement in 

 the latter. 



Habitat. Creek boundary. Western Texas, New Mexico. 



The specimens of rhrynosoma cornutum present nothing remarkable; the 

 abdomen and chin of a young one are spotted all over with black spots, and 

 lines of different shapes. 



Habitat. Arkansas, western country from Missouri to Texas, Creek and Chero- 

 kee countries, Western Texas, Santa Fe, New Mexico, Kansas. 



LACERTIDiE. 



Seven specimens of Cnemidorophous gularis, Baird and Girard. These are 

 distinguished from C. sexlineatus by the broader stripes and larger size of the 

 scales ; the fronto-nasal plates appear also to be comparatively smaller in gularis. 



Habitat. Texas, New Mexico and Kansas. 



SCINCID^. 



Five specimens of Plestiodon obsoletum, B. & G. No two of them are colored 

 precisely alike. They all have a general resemblance, yet each differs from the 

 other. This difference is produced mainly by the greater or less extent to which 

 tbe scales are spotted with black ; in one specimen, the greater part of each 

 scale upon the body being thus spotted; in another, the ground color, which is 

 drab, greatly preponderates ; head brown or olive, marked with dark lines and 

 spots, under parts silvery white. 



Habitat. Borders of Rio San Pedro, Texas, Kansas. 



CHALCIDID^. 



Ophisaurus ventralis, two specimens. 



These present different markings ; they both are drab colored above, with a 

 brown band running from the occiput along the middle of the back to the ex- 

 tremity of the tail ; sides black, with two narrow white vitta;, the upper termi- 

 nating five inches from the extremity of the tail ; the lower on the left side 4 

 inches 2 lines from the anus ; and on the right 1 inch 4 lines ; three white lines 

 upon the tail anteriorly ; two narrow brown bands on each side of the abdo- 

 men. Length of head, neck and body 5j inches ; of tail 1 foot 2 inches. Tbe 

 other specimen is olive above, with a brown band along the middle, but the neck 

 and anterior part of the body is marked with white narrow oeellated spots, and 

 and instead of the lateral vitta there are upon the sides on a black ground, three 

 rows of interrupted white spots, often united so as to form a line with very im- 

 perfect margins ; under surface silvery white ; length of head, neck and body 

 7| inches ; of tail, 1 foot, 5 inches, 4 lines. 



A specimen from Verdigris river resembles the first in its markings; another 




240 [October, 



and very large and stout specimen in the collection of the Academy is black 

 above without any vitta whatever, but marked with transverse longitudinal 

 rows of small spots ; in another, ttie ground color above is brown, and black upon 

 the sides with longitudinal lines of black expanded at intervals, and in these 

 places surrounded with light colored spots, the spots upon the black ground and 

 on the sides much larger; in another, there are longitudinal lines of white spots 

 upon a black ground upon the back, with narrow lines of the same color upon 

 the sides; in anotberj there are transverse bands of white spots on each side, 

 upon the back, which is of a beautiful light brown, and white spots upon the 

 head, the lateral white lines barred at intervals with cross bars of the same 

 colors, with ten rows of dark brown spots upon the middle of the tail. A 

 specimen from South Carolina is light brown above with lateral rows of darker 

 brown ; another from North Carolina is of a uniform drab color above, the 

 scales upon the sides which are greyish marked with numerous black spots of 

 different dimensions and irregular in shape, the abdomen dark dale color ; under 

 part of tail olive with four longitudinal lines of black spots, so that it will be 

 seen that this species varies much in its mode of coloration. According to Dr. Hol- 

 brook, the under surface during life is bright yellow, most remarkable at the 

 abdomen. Dumeril and Bibron describe four varieties, including two nominal 

 speiies, (punctatus and striatulus,) mentioned by Cuvier.

 Louisiana, and in many of the States bordering on the Missouri and Ohio rivers. 

 Its Northern range west of |he Alleghanies is Michigan, according to Dr. Holbrook,

SbRPENTES INNOCUI. 



Fam. CALAMARIDJ^:. 



The Calamarians belong to the second section or sub-order of Ophidians, the 

 Afilyphodont or Aaemii)phid Serpents of Dumeril and Bibron, characterized as 

 having "recurved, conical, rounded, full and smooth teeth, without cannelation 

 at their points, implanted in both jaws." The serpents belonging to this family 

 have the "body very slender, rounded, and almost of the same thickness from 

 the head to the tail." Dumeril and Bibron assert that all the serpents belonging 

 to it are terrestrial, and divide the family into nine genera, distributed in the E. 

 Indies, (Oligodon without palatine teeth,) (4 sp.) Java, Sumatra, Borneo and 

 Celebes (Calamaria,) (12 sp.) Mexico, Cayenne, Surinam, Santa Cruz, Bolivia, 

 New Granada, Java, (Rabdosoma,) (G sp.) Cape of Good Hope, (Homalosoma,) 

 (1 sp.) Celebes, Macassar, (Rabdion,) (2 sp.) Java, (Elapoidis ) (1 sp.) Ceylon, 

 and the Phillipines, (Aspidura,) (1 sp.) N. America, (Carphophis,) (2 sp.) and 

 (Conocephalus) (1 sp.) To the two last, originating in N. America, we add the 

 following, contained in the Kansas collection, and which, in its general charac- 

 ters, bears a strong resemblance to Homalosoma, but differs from it in the cari- 

 nation of the scales, the acuteness of the snout, the shape of the frontal (vertical) 

 plate, &c. 



Gen. MIOROPS, nob. 



Char. Head small, flattened above and posteriorly, depressed in front ; snout 

 acute ; nine plates upon the top of the head, the pre-frontal considerably larger 

 than the internasals ; frontal plate short, but longer than broad, the two lateral 

 margins nearly straight; nostril in a single plate, near its anterior margin; 

 a frenai, one anterior ocular and two posterior oculars ; seven superior labials, 

 the fifth and sixth the largest, the sixth intercalated between the fifth and 

 seventh, the eye resting on the third and fourth ; occipital plates margined ex- 

 ternally by a row of four or five plates; pupil circular; posterior geneials very 

 long, anterior small and transverse; teeth minute, existing both in the palate 

 and maxillaries ; scales strongly carinated, except the two inferior rows, elonga- 

 ted, slightly notched posteriorly ; gastrosteganot ascending highupon the flanks; 

 tail short and pointed, with a double row of scutes. 




1856.] 241 



MiCROPS LINEATUS, DOb. 



Char. Size about the same as that of Homalosoma lutrix. 



The head is quite small, slightly rounded above, depressed in front; nine 

 plates ; snout acute ; nostril in a single plate, which is more or less quad- 

 rangular, quite near its superior margin, and very much nearer its anterior than its 

 posterior extremity; on the leftside this plate is cleft inferiorly below the nostril ; 

 a loral ; one anterior orbitar ; two posterior orbitars : seven superior labials, 

 the eye resting on the third and fourth, the sixth acutely angular, intercalated 

 between the fifth and the seventh, not reaching the margin of the jaw ; body 

 slender, thicker in the middle, covered with 19 rows of scales, all of which are 

 very strongly carinated, except the three or four inferior rows, the last being quite 

 smooth and larger than the others ; scales with the exception of the three inferior 

 rows on each side narrow, subellipical, bi-punctate posteriorly, the carina reach- 

 ing the entire length of the scale; tail short and tapering to a point; abdom. 

 scut. 138. subcaud. 34; a single prseanal. 



Coloration. Brown above, with three narrow yellow dorsal vittaj ; the middle 

 occupying one row and half of the adjoining row of scales ; head above brown ; 

 upper jaw light yellow; abdomen and under part of tail yellow, with a double 

 row of triangular spots of a bluish green color along the middle and base of tail; 

 these spots are sometimes confluent at their bases ; the spots beneath the epi- 

 dermis are perfectly black. 



Dimensions. Length of head 4 lines ; greatest breadth 2 ; length of body to vent 

 7 inches 5 lines ; of tail 1 inch 4 lines. 



Habitat. Kansas. One specimen in Mus. Acad., presented by Dr. Hammond. 



Gen. Remarks. At first sight this serpent might be taken for a young Tropi- 

 donote, but a close inspection of the frontal and other plates and the shape of 

 the head indicate the difference. It is of nearly the same size as Homalosoma 

 lutrix of the Cape of Good Hope, but in that genus the snout is obtuse and the 

 shape of the frontal plate not the same, and that of the scales, which are smooth, 

 is very different ; the nasal, however, is in a single plate. In Ischognathus 

 Dekayi the frontal plate is broader, the nostrils between two plates, and there 

 is no loral (Leptognathien, D. & B.) In Conocephalus the snout is acute, and the 

 frontal plate similar but more narrowed, but there is no pre-ocular and but 

 one post-ocular, a long frenal and the nostril between two plates. In Strepto- 

 phorus (Leptognathien) the frontal is broader, the pre-frontals very greatly 

 larger than the inter-nasals; the nostrils between two plates ; no pre-ocular, 

 two post-oculars and a long frenal. 



Fam. CORYPHODONTID^E, 



CORYPHODON FLAVIVENTRIS. 



Among the reptiles presQnted to the Academy by Dr. Hammond is one specimen 

 of the Coluber flaviventris of Say, (Say's Expedition to Rocky Mountains, vol, i,p. 

 185.) This specimen is olivaceous above, yellow beneath, except upon chin and 

 throat, and along margins of lower jaw, which are white ; under part of tail of a 

 lighteryellow than that upon abdomen ; seven superior labials, the eye resting on 

 the third and fourth ; asmall supplementary plate on each side, below the anterior 

 frontal, intercalated between the second and fourth labials ; a quadrangular 

 frenal, two post-oculars ; nostrils between two plates; plates upon temples as 

 described by Say ; 17 rows of smooth elongate scales near the middle of the body; 

 the inferior row the largest; 17 rows upon neck, 15 near the tail ; tail of moder- 

 ate length, longer than in Ablabes. 171 abdom. scuta ; a bifid prsEanal ; 5G 

 sub-caud. (tail mutilated). Total length 2 ft. 6 inches ; of Lead, neck and body 

 2 ft. ; circumference 2 inches. Say describes the posterior and basal edge of 

 the scales as black, and in one specimen an indistinct double row of reddish 

 brown spots irregularly alternating on each side of the abdomen ; these markings 

 are not observed in Dr. Hammond's specimen. 



The genus Coryphodon of Dumeril and Bibron takes its name from two 

 Greek words Ko^y^, Cacumen, summum in quavis re, summit, and oSouc, tooth, in- 



18 




242 [October, 



dicating the progressive augmentation or length of the teeth as they recede 

 backward, the following being the essential characters as given by the learned 

 authors, Erpet. Gen. Tom. vii. p. ITS. 



Les Coryphodontikns. 



Char. " Serpents with smooth unequal teeth ; the anterior much shorter 

 than those which follow, and increasing successively in length from in front 

 posteriorly." They constitute the seventh family of the great sub-order of Agly- 

 phodont Ophidians. The characters of the genus are the same as those of the 

 family. The scales of this genus are more or less elong&i^^, smooth or carinated. 

 It is the only one of the family, and comprise six species, inhabiting North and 

 S. America, the E. Indies and the Indian Archipelago, (Sumatra, Phillipines). 

 Several serpents have been described under the generic name Bascanion by Prof. 

 Baird and Girard, having all smooth scales, but as the characters are drawn 

 from the external forms alone and not the teeth, and inasmuch as many of 

 these are of secondary importance, and not always constant, this genus, it 

 appears to us, cannot be retained. e. g. The head in Coryphodon pan- 

 therinus, a South American species, is not narrow but broad, the supple- 

 mentary plate beneath the ant-orbitar is absent, andthere are but 15 rows of 

 scales, &c. In a specimen of Coryphodon constrictor before me, the eye rests 

 on the fourth and fifth superior labial, which is prolonged upward, and the 

 supplementary plate below the large anterior orbitar is between the third and 

 fourth upper labials ; the same occurs in another specimen belonging to 

 the Bonaparte collection. This arrangement, however, is probably exceptional. 

 In the young specimen found at Beesley's Point, and which does not differ 

 materially in its coloring from that discovered in Kansas, there are but 5 

 superior labials, the third and fifth greatly prolonged, the eye resting solely on 

 the third, and there are three posterior labials. The external characters of Mas- 

 ticophis apply almost equally well to Psammophis, an' African and Asiatic 

 genus, yet how different the form and arrangement of the teeth in Masticophis 

 flavigularis (Herpetodryas) and in the latter genus. 



Among the specimens is one which appears to be a young Coryphodon con- 

 strictor ; the general coloration resembles very much that of Ablabes triangu- 

 lum, but it is at once distinguished by the shape of the head and the form of 

 the frontal plate. The following are its characters, which may be interesting, 

 showing the great chasge which age sometimes develops in the coloration of 

 serpents: Head long, flattened above, depressed in front; frontal long and 

 narrow, narrower behind, excavated laterally ; eye large, seven superior labials, 

 the eye resting on the third and fourth ; nostril between two plates ; a more or 

 less quadrangular loral ; one large ant-orbitar, very narrow below, broad above, 

 appearing upon the top of the head, between the prefrontal and supraorbitar ; 

 a small supplementary plate beneath it ; two post-oculars ; two rows of plates 

 upon each temple between the occipital and superior labials; scales perfectly 

 smooth, 17 rows near the middle of the body ; inferior lateral rows the largest. 

 Total length 1 foot 1\ lines ; length of head 6 lines ; greatest breadth 3 ; length 

 of tail 3 inches. 



Coloration. Head above brown, occipital and frontal plates marked with yellow ; 

 chin, throat and superior labials yellow, the posterior edges of the latter black ; 

 a red and ash brown circular spot immediately behind the occipital plates ; 

 54 well marked transverse reddish brown blotches upon the back, not reach- 

 ing to the tail, becoming indistinct in a space of 2]- inches ; the lateral extremi- 

 ties of the transverse blotches are separated from the abdominal scutes by four 

 and a half rows of scales ; sides covered all over with brown spots ; a black spot 

 near the exterior extremity of each abdominal scute, at its posteii^or margin, and 

 one or more smaller near the middle, upon the anterior part of the abdomen ; 

 rest of abdominal surface and of under part of tail yellow, in the latter region 

 almost white. Ab. scut. 171 ; one bifid prreanal ; 80 subcaud. 



Gen. Remarks. The colors of this animal are so different that it might be 

 readily mistaken for a distinct species. The Col. vernalis of Dekay has been 




1856.] 243 



taken for the young of the Constrictor, which hardly differs more in color from 

 the adult than does Col. vernalis, but Col. vernalis is no doubt the adult age, 

 and appears to belong to a different genus, viz., Herpetodryas. 



Herpetodryas vernalis. 



Syn. Col. vernalis, Dekay Col. vernalis, Holbrook, N. Am. Herpet. vol. 

 3, p. 79. Chlorosoma vernalis, Baird and Girard, Cat. N. Am. Serp. p. 108. 



Two specimens. These do not differ from the other well known individuals. 

 This serpent has a wide range, being found in New York, Maine, Pennsylvania, 

 Wisconsin, Massachusetts, (Baird & Girard,) Connecticut, (Holh.) We have one 

 specimen from Rhode Island presented by Mr. S. Powell. Wagler gives as the 

 type of his genus Chlorosoma the Coluber viridissimus of Linnseus, (habitat 

 Surinam,) which is a serpent about three feet in length, the Col. vernalis a little 

 more than one. The two serpents belong to different families, the one being an 

 Isodontian, according to Dumeril and Bibron's arrangement, having the teeth 

 smooth, alike, equally spaced, and the head larger than the neck, and is inno- 

 cuous, the other belonging to the suborder of Opistoglyphes, having one or 

 more posterior teeth longer and channelled, and is venomous. (Fam. Dipsadiens.) 

 The Col. viridissimus of Linnaeus (Chlorosoma viridissimum, Wagler,) belongs 

 to the genus Dryophylax of Dumeril and Bibron, characterized as having the 

 " head conical, rather long, but little distinct from the trunk, in which the infe- 

 rior region is separated from the flanks by a more or less salient line which the 

 gastrostega form toward their extremities ; tail usually long, tapering and 

 rather slender; eyes of the ordinary size, pupil round, subcaudal; scutes bifid.' 

 (Tome vii. p. 1103.) Dumeril and Bibron state that they do not retain the 

 generic name of Chlorosoma of Wagler, he not having characterized it with 

 sufficient precision. In Dryophylax viridissimus the eye rests on the fourth and 

 fifth superior labials, (third and fourth in vernalis,) there is but one anterior 

 orbitar, (two in vernalis,) and there is no loral, the posterior frontals passing 

 down alongside of the head to join the superior labials. There is but one tem- 

 poral plate, (three in vernalis,) and there are eight superior labials, (seven in 

 vernalis ;) tail 9 inches 8 lines in viridissimus, 3 inches 4 lines in vernalis. 



Sub-Gen. ELAPHIS, Aldrovandi. 



Char. "Head usually but little distinct from the body, and for the most part 

 slightly conical, with a snout inclined a little downward ; trunk almost always 

 cylindrical; sides of the abdomen but little angular; scales of the trunk strongly 

 or feebly carinated." D. et B. 



Elaphis Alleghaniensis. 



Syn. Scotophis Alleghaniensis, B. & G. 



Two specimens. The coloration of these corresponds very well with the de- 

 scriptions of Coluber Alleghaniensis by Prof. Holbrook, of Scotophis Alleghani- 

 ensis, by Baird and Girard, except that the posterior part of the abdomen and 

 under part of tail is not uniformly slate black, being tinged to a certain extent 

 with yellow; the number of superior marginal labial plates in these specimens 

 is eight, the seventh the largest; the two inferior rows only appear to be smooth, 

 except upon the neck, (according to Holbrook four, and Baird and Girard seven ;) 

 near the occiput the scales are perfectly smooth. Total length 3 feet 8]- inches, 

 (Fr.;) of tail 5| inches ; of another 3 feet 6^- ; of tail 5J. Abdom. scut. 221 in 

 one; 1 bifid prseanal ; 66 subcaudal ; in the other, ab. scut. 227 ; subcaudal 176. 

 Circumference of first specimen at its middle 3 inches 7 lines ; of second 2 

 inches 4 lines. Subcaudal scutes larger in the larger specimen. 



The genus Elaphis appears to be very well characterized, and comprehends, 

 according to Dumeril and Bibron, thirteen species distributed in various parts 

 of the world Montevideo, (pleurostictus,) borders of the Caspian, Persia, S. 

 Europe, Japan, (virgatus,) N. America, islands south of Japan, (conspicillatus.) 

 It is one of the very few genera of serpents common to Europe and America. 




244 [October, 



The species inhabiting the United States are Elaphis Alleghaniensis, guttatus, 

 quadrivittatus and vulpinus ; three others have been described by Dumeril and 

 Bibron, viz., E. spiloides, rubriceps and Holbrookii ; and Profs. Baird and Girard 

 describe also three, viz., Scotophis Lindheimerii, confinis, listus ; the only speci- 

 mens of these we have at present in our collection beside the three first enume- 

 rated, are two of vulpinus, presented by Dr. Gavin Watson, from the neighborhood 

 of Buffalo, New York, which are readily determined from the description of Baird 

 and Girard, and which undoubtedly belong to the genus Elaphis, which, accord- 

 ing to Dumeril and Bibron, was established by Aldrovandi in 1640 for thequad- 

 ri-radiatus of Gmelin, (Elaphis fcervone.) Elaphis Holbrookii is represented as 

 without spots or bands upon the flanks. 



The geographical range of Alleghaniensis, accerding to Prof. Holbrook, is the 

 Blue Ridge, Virginia, Highlands of the Hudson, N. Y., and Mountains of Caro- 

 lina, and according to Profs. Baird and Girard, Carlisle, Penna., Creek boundary, 

 (Hallowell.) 



Ablabes, D, & B. 



Char. " Colubriform serpents with a moderate head, generally somewhat 

 distinct from the trunk, which is almost cylindrical ; abdomen separated from 

 the flanks by an angle but little salient, the scuta being scarcely elevated upon 

 the sides ; snout short, smooth and rounded ; eyes rather small ; tail of moderate 

 length, somewhat tapering ; scales of the trunk rhomboidal, for the most part 

 short and without carinse." D. & B. 



Ablabes Triangulum. Var. calligaster. 



Among the collection of reptiles presented by Dr. Hammond, are three snakes 

 resembling the Coluber eximius of Dekay, but which differ in the markings about 

 the head, in the general color, but more especially in the number of scales, there 

 being but twenty-one rows in eximius, and from twenty to twenty-seven, (20 to- 

 wards the tail and 25 upon the neck,) in one of these specimens ; 25 in the others. 

 The blotches upon the back, of which there are fifty, are more narrow than in that 

 species, their external margins being separated from the abdominal scutes by seven 

 rows of scales; the blotches are from three to five lines in length by eight in breadth; 

 there are eighteen transverse spots upon the tail ; two rows of lateral spots, the 

 superior much larger than the inferior ; the head is long, the frontal (vertical) 

 plate longer than broad, the gape of the mouth extensive, the eye resting on the 

 4th and 5th superior labials in advance of the middle of the gape ; scales per- 

 fectly smooth, more narrow and elongate than in eximius; 210 abdom. scut. 1 

 bifid prajanal ; 65 subcaudal ; total length 2 feet 7 inches, (Fr.) ; of tail 5 inches 

 3 lines ; another 2 feet 6} inches, and a third, 2 feet 8J inches in length ; in 

 another 206 ab. scut.; a single praeanal, 243 subcaud. ; and in a third 198 abdom. 

 scut, one single prajanal and 41 subcaudal. These numbers agree sufficiently 

 well with those of calligaster, as given by Harlan, viz. abdom. 213, caudal 52, 

 (Med. & Phys. Research, p. 122.) whereas in eximius the abdominal plates, ac- 

 cording to Harlan, run as high as 250 in number. Dr. Holbrook, however, gives 

 198 abdom., 1 preanal, 247 subcaudal, and Harlan states that in a living 

 one which he observed, there were only 33pair of caudal scutes. In Professor Baird 

 and Girard's specimens of eximius, the number of abdominal plates varied from 

 200 to 214, and the abdominal from 49 to 55 ; the total length from 2 l&QiAl inches 

 to 3 feet 10 inches, corresponding in this respect with Harlan's description of 

 calligaster, which he says was about 4 feet long ; so that there does not appear to 

 be any material difference between the eximius of Dekay, and the specimens 

 under consideration, either in the number of plates or in the length of the 

 animal, but chiefly, as before stated, in the greater number of rows of scales of 

 the latter; in all Profs. Baird and Girard's specimens of eximius, and in those of 

 the Academy, the number being but 21. There can be little doubt, we think, 

 that the specimens from Kansas are identical with the calligaster of Say, for 

 Dr. Harlan, who appears to have first described those in the Philadelphia 

 Museum, is of opinion that they may be a variety of eximius. Prof. Holbrook, 




1856.] 245 



who examined the originals of Say, states that they are the same, differing only 

 in the greater number of plates in calligaster ; but it is quite possible that he 

 may not have counted the rows of scales. In all of the Kansas specimens, the 

 coloration of the head and neck is different from that usually observed in exi- 

 mius, and in two of them entirely so, there being in each two dark brown longi- 

 tudinal blotches upon the temples, and on the neck, one on each side, and another 

 about half the length of these between them, the triangular spots described by 

 Lacepede, being altogether absent. Ground color of head above brown, with no 

 white stripes or bands, but a band of dark browu extending across the posterior 

 margin of the pre-frontal plates. The ground color of the body and tail 

 above is brown, the transverse spots or blotches much darker, each with a 

 slight margin of a lighter brown than the ground color; the blotches are more 

 narrow than in eximius, occupying from two to three rows of scales only in 

 length, and from eight to ten in breadth ; 45 in one, (the 45th opposite the anus,) 

 upon the body; 18 upon the tail; 47 in another; and 18 upon the tail, and in a 

 third 49; the 49th opposite the anus, and 14 upon the tail; blotches upon tail 

 quite narrow, minutely black spotted and maculated, as well as interspaces and 

 sides; color of abdomen as in eximius. Notwithstanding the great resem- 

 blance in the number of abdominal and subcaudal plates, and general appear- 

 ance, we are inclined to consider the above specimens as belonging to a variety 

 distinct from eximius, being, in fact, the calligaster of Say. We have recently 

 received from Kimball's Museum, Boston, (whither the originals of Say had been 

 transferred,) through Dr. Holbrook, one of the originals of Say's calligaster ; the 

 tail is broken off with a small portion of the body, but it corresponds with Dr. 

 Harlan's description, and Prof. Holbrook's notice of it, the scales, of which there 

 are twenty-five rows, being perfectly smooth. We therefore have a confirmation 

 of the statement of Prof. Holbrook, of the specific identity of eximius and cal- 

 ligaster, and of the opinion of Dumeril and Bibron, who place it, as well as 

 clericus, among the synonyms of Ablabes triangulum, and I am happy to agree 

 with those learned and very eminent Herpetologists. 



The following may be given as the characters of Albabes triangulum, var. 

 calligaster. 



Char. Head rather long ; seven superior labials ; body of moderate thickness, 

 with from 25 to 27 rows of smooth scales ; tail about l-6th of the total length ; 

 color brown above, with from 45 to 49 rows of black transverse narrow blotches 

 upon back and 14 to 18 upon tail; two lateral rows of smaller blotches upon 

 sides ; under part of body beautifully tesselated with black and white ; abdom. 

 scut. 198, 210, subcaudar41, 65 ; length 2 feet 6|, 2 feet8i and 3 feet 10 inches, 

 (Fr.) 



OeograpMcal Distribution. Kansas, Missouri. 



Oen. Remarks. Dumeril and Bibron state that the name triangulum has pre- 

 cedence over that of eximius of Dekay, having been applied to the same species 

 by Count Lacepede, in his Hist, des Serpens, published in 1789, Tome, 2, p.*331. 

 The description of Lacepede is very precise, but it appears to us that it applies, 

 not to the eximius as usually described, but rather to the clericus of Baird and 

 Girard. The description of Lacepede is as follows: "Nous nommons ainsi 

 (triangle,) cette espece de couleuvre parce qu'on voit sur le sommet de la tete, qui 

 est garni de neuf grandes ecailles une tache triangulaire charge dans le milieu 

 d'une antre tache triangulaire plus petite et d'une couleur beaucoup plus claire 

 ou quelquefois plus foncee ; des ecailles unies et en lozange couv'rentle, dessus du 

 corps, qui est blanchatre avec des taches rousses irregulieres et bordees de noir; on, 

 voit un rang de petites taches de chaque cote du dos et une tache noire allongee, 

 et placee obliquement derriere chaque ceil." The length of Count Lacepedes 

 specimen was 2 feet 7 inches 2 lines, tail 3 inches. Abdom. sc. 213, subcaud. 

 48 pair. There can be no doubt therefore of the priority of Lacepede's 

 description which is very accurate, but inasmuch as but one row of lateral spots 

 is mentioned, there is some doubt whether it applies to eximius or to the ser- 

 pent described by Baird and Girard, having only o?ze row of lateral spots, 

 (Ophibolus clericus.) We have a number of specimens with but a single row of 




246 October J 



lateral spots with transverse blotches much broader, and reaching to the abdo- 

 minal rows of scales, but in which the size and position of the eyes do no* 

 appear to form constant characters. The blotches in a recent specimen are o^ 

 a bright red, a very inappropriate color for a clercius, according to our present 

 notions. The specimens marked eximius are all immature, v?ith one excep- 

 tion, but all have the double row of spots. 



Ablabe3jTriangulum, var, clericus] 



Char. A large triangular red blotch upon posterior part of head and neck, 

 with a smaller one of a lighter color in the middle ; a black band from the eye 

 to the angle of the mouth ; 27 rows of quadrate blotches upon the back, of a 

 bright red color bordered with black, the 27th opposite the anus; eight upon the 

 tail ; the blotches upon the back separated from the abdominal scuta by a row 

 and one half of scales, and sometimes reaching as far as the last row ; a single 

 row of much smaller lateral spots of a red color bordered with black, inter- 

 mediate as respects the position of the larger ones, occupying the last or abdo- 

 minal row of scales, and a portion of the abdominal plates ; 21 rows of scales ; 

 abdom. scut. 19G, pra3anal single, subcaud. 44 ; circumference 2 inches 7 lines. 

 Total length 2 feet 7i inches, of tail 3 inches 11 lines. 



It will be observed that these characters differ very little from those given by 

 Count Lacepede.

For description of var. eximius,* see Dr. Holbrook's work, N. American 

 Herpet., vol. 3, p. 69. 



The geographical range of eximius, according to Prof. Holbrook, is Maine, 

 Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Illinois, and high up the 

 Missouri, (calligaster, Say,) and New York, (Prof. Baird.) 



Gen. TANTILLA, B. and G. 



Among the Ophidians of Dr. Hammond's collection is a very small Calamarian, 

 resembling in its general appearance Carphophis ama;na, Dum. and Bib., but 

 much more slender and of a lighter brown color. The arrangement of the 

 plates upon the head, however, is quite different, and I cannot find a genus into 

 which to place it, among those of the Calamarians characterized by Dum. and 

 Bibron, in the Catalogue of North American Serpents of Baird and Girard, un- 

 less it be Tantilla, or of the snakes in the British Museum, by Mr. Gray. 

 The following are its characters : Head small, slightly rounded above, depressed 

 in front ; snout smooth, rounded, nine plates upon the top of the head, the two 

 anterior frontals much smaller than the posterior, which pass down on each 

 side of the head between the posterior nasal and the anterior orbitar plates, and 

 are in contact with the siijjcrior labials; nostrils between two plates, situated in the 

 anterior of the two for the most part, at its posterior edge ; vertical or frontal plate 

 short and broad, hexagonal, the posterior angle much more acute than the an- 

 terior; occipitals rather long, pentagonal; the supraciliaries do not project over 

 the eye ; but two temporal plates ; no loral, the posterior frontal taking the place 

 of it; one ant-orbitar and one post-orbitar, the latter somewhat larger than the 

 former ; six superior labials, the eye resting on the third and fourth, the fourth, 

 fifth and sixth much larger than the preceding ones ; eye small ; six inferior 

 labial?, the fourth the largest; body slender, somewhat thicker near the middle, 

 with 15 rows of smooth and rhomboidal scales ; five longitudinal rows of smooth 

 rhomboidal scales, four scales in each beneath the neck, between the posterior 

 geneial and front abdominal scutes ; three inferior lateral rows of scales larger 



*Dr. Dekay says of the eximius, "it is rare to find them exceeding 4 feet ; the 

 more usual length is about two." 




1856.] 247 



f.han the others ; color light brown or olive above, lighter beneath, approaching to 

 white, a narrow dark colored line along the middle of the back, commencing at 

 the occiput; head of a darker brown than the rest of body; ab. scut. 130 ; one 

 single praeanal and 42 bifid sub-caud. 



Dimensions. Length of head 3 lines ; greatest breadth 2 ; length of neck and 

 body 5 inches ; of tail 1 inch 6J lines ; total length 6 inches 9;^, lines. 



Habitat. Kansas. 



Gen. Remarks. This serpent corresponds very closely with Tantilla of 

 Baird and Girard, and may be their Tantilla gracilis, which, however, wants 

 the vertebral line. In their species the posterior frontal do not come in contact 

 with the labials and the vertical plate is represented as anteriorly acute. Tbe 

 number of rows of smooth scales, of orbitar plates and abdominal and sub-caudal 

 scutes agree very well, there being 129 of the former and 45 of the latter. 



We do not find, however, that the inferior row of scales is considerably broader 

 than the others, if indeed so broad as the row above it. 



Habitat. Indianola. 



CORONELLA LAURBNTI, 1768. 



Char. " Serpents with posterior superior maxillary teeth longer and on the same 

 line with the others, without interval ; trunk elongated ; scales smooth ; snout 

 rounded and but little elongated." D. & B. 



CORONELLA DOLIATA, var. 



There is one specimen of Coronella doliata, one foot three inches in length ; 

 and two specimens resembling the Calamaria elapsoidea of Holbrook, which ap- 

 pear to be the young of the former. They do not belong to the genus Calamaria, 

 which has but one nasal plate and no frenal, elapsoidea having no frenal and 

 the nostril between two plates. We have also in the collection of the Academy 

 a specimen marked elapsoidea from the Creek boundary, which, however, has a 

 loral plate and is no doubt a young coronella. The following notes may charac- 

 terize suflBciently these specimens: Cor. doliata, adult. Head resemblicg that of 

 Elaps ; vertical (frontal) plate a little longer than broad ; two lines in breadth ; 

 occipitals short ; pre-frontals (posterior frontals) much larger than the inter- 

 nasals (ant. frontals) ; nostrils between two plates ; a small and narrow frenal ; 

 one anterior and two posterior oculars, seven superior labials, the eye resting on 

 the third and fourth ; 21 rows of smooth, quadrangular, elongated scales ; tail 

 short, 3 inches 3 lines in length. Abdom. scut. 200; one single prasanal ; 52 

 subcaudal. 



Coloration. Twenty-nine red spots upon the back, bordered with black ; in- 

 terspaces between the black bands white ; the red spots are for the most part 

 more narrow in the middle, more extended laterally ; the black bands occasional- 

 ly almost touching each other; the black bands coalesce with black, gub-quad- 

 rate spots upon the abdomen, having other black spots intermediate; a black, 

 transverse band across the occipital plates ; a few black spots upon the upper 

 labials ; ground colour below light yellow ; the black bands upon the back are 

 from two to two and a half lines measured longitudinally, being about thrice 

 the dimensions of those of a specimen from Delaware. The red spots or trans- 

 verse bands occupy from two to two and a half rows of scales, as do also the 

 black bands upon the margins. In the specimen from Delaware the red spots 

 occupy a much greater space, the first comprising 11 rows of scales, butC in the 

 Kansas specimen ; the second six, in the Kansas specimen three, and the black 

 margins are also much more narrow, occupying IJ rows of scales ; the black 

 tesselated markings upon the abdomen also differ, and the alternate black spots 

 are not seen except towards the tail ; the snout is more acute, and the number 

 of rows of scales is less, viz.: 19. Ab. scuta 18G ; one single praeanal ; and 42 

 sub-caudal. 



In the specimens of Ophibolus gracilis, B. and G., the anterior black rin2;3 

 so extend as to cover the whole head above, except the very tips ; in other speci- 

 mens the black rings run into each other. In another there were only 21 pairs

of rings. They are from Arkansas and Louisiana ; number of rows of scales not 

 mentioned, (Cat. N. Am. Reptiles in Smith. Inst. p. 91). Ophibolus is not cha- 

 racterized with sufficient precision to be retained, including as it does two genera, 

 Ablabes and Coronella, belonging to different families, the one (Ablabes) an 

 Isodontian, with teeth of equal length, the other (Coronella) a syncraterian, 

 (posterior teeth in the latter much larger and stronger than those which precede 

 them, a well marked character in our specimens). The one from Delaware 

 corresponds very well with Prof. Holbrook's Coronella doliata, though the rings 

 are not so generally confluent with the spots upon the abdomen. 



In one of the younger specimens, one 9 J the other 7f inches in length, the red 

 blotches are much wider apart, the black rings more narrow in proportion and 

 the white interspaces wider than in the other. The black rings in rows, in these 

 specimens entirely surround the abdomen. (We need for the thorough elucida- 

 tion of the natural history of the Coronellians resembling each other so much 

 in color, a greater number of specimens and of all ages. Our friends would 

 confer a favor upon science would they take care, as has been the case to a 

 great extent in the Kansas collection, to send us numerous specimens of the same 

 species.) 



Gen. Ramarlis. The coloration of this serpent differs very considerably from 

 that of the figure of Ophibolus gentilis, B. and G., in the exploration of the Red 

 river of Louisiana, by Capt. Randolph B. Marcy and George B. McClellan. The 

 blotches in that figure are much more extended, and the black marginal rings 

 much wider apart. In one of these specimens there were 25 instead of 29 pairs 

 of black rings, the red portion occupying a much greater space ; but in another 

 there were 28; dorsal row of scales 21; Ab. scut. 198 ; sub-caud. 45; total 

 length 20 inches. These black ringed Coronellians will probably, when a suf- 

 ficient number of specimens shall have been procured from diiferent parts of 

 the Union to determine the question, turn out to be for the most part varieties 

 of one and the same species. 



Gen. Tropidonotus, Kuhl. 



The genus Tropidonotus belongs to the family of Syncraterians of Dum. and 

 Bibron, in which the teeth are in a continuous row without interval, and the 

 posterior longer than the others ; the scales in this genus, as its name indicates, 

 are always carinated, more especially those upon the flanks. The tail is of 

 moderate length. Three species in the collection belong to this genus, viz. : 

 Tropidonotus parictalis of Say, of which there are three fine specimens ; a much 

 larger one, (Trop. obliquus,) and Trop. ordinatus. 



TuopiDONOTUS PARiETALis, Say. 



The collection made by Dr. Hammond includes two specimens of Tropidonotus 

 parietalis. Both these serpents correspond with the short but clear de- 

 scription of Say. The red spots on the sides are very apparent; one of the 

 specimens is quite stout, the circumference being 3^ inches at the middle; 147 

 abdom. scut, a single prseanal, (tail mutilated) 19 rows of scales, the inferior 

 row smooth, the middle stripe broad, occupying one and the half of each 

 adjoining row of scales. In the smaller specimen, Ab. so. 155., and 83 sub- 

 caudal ; tail of moderate length, rather long and tapering. 



Habiiat. Between San Antonio, El Paso, Missouri (Say); Kansas, California, 

 (Dr. Heermann); Rio San Pedro, Texas, (Woodhouse.) 



There is but one specimen of Tropidonotus ordinatus (young) with the lateral 

 stripes very distinct, three rows of alternate black spots; extremities of abdo- 

 minal scales black spotted anteriorly ; occipital plates bi-punctate ; 21 rows of 

 scales all carinated, inferior row largest; ab. sc. 167, a single prajnal, 78 sub- 

 caudal. Total length, 1 foot 1 inch 7 lines, of tail 3^ inches. 



Tropidonotus obliquus, nob. 

 Char. Head long, flattened above, nostril between two plates, a loral, other 

 plates normal, 8 superior labials, the eye resting on the 4th and 5th, 6th and 7th 




1856.] 249 



the largest; immediately behind the middle post-ocular one temporal plate be- 

 tween the occipital and the superior labials ; 23 rows of carinated scales, the 

 inferior row but slightly carinated and larger than the others ; scales strongly 

 emarginate posteriorly, the carinae running the whole length of the scale ; scales 

 long and ratber narrow upon the back, broader towards the abdomen. 140 ab. sc. 

 1 bifid pra3anal, and 69 sub caudal ; tail rather long, tapering to a point ; body 

 robust, size about that of Tr. sipedon. 



Coloration. Greyish above, with large transverse and more or less oblique 

 blotches of the same color bordered with black, extending as far as the abdo- 

 minal scales; they are quite broad, occupying about five rows of scales, and have 

 very irregular margins ; the interspaces between them are comparatively very 

 narrow, from a scale to nearly two in width ; 32 of these oblique blotches may 

 be counted, the 32d opposite the anus ; 18 or 19 transverse brownish bands 

 upon the tail; under surface resembling very much that of sipedon, the ground 

 color yellow, which predominates greatly at the anterior part; throat and under 

 jaws quite yellow, the posterior margins of the inferior labials bordered with 

 brown. 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch 5 lines ; greatest breadth 9 ; length of 

 body 2 feet, 1 inch, 7 lines ; of tail 8 inches; total length, 2 feet, 10 inches, 1 

 line ; circumference 3 inches, 1 line. 



Gen. Remarks. This serpent differs from Trop. rhombifer and transversus. 

 It resembles very much a specimen in the possession of Dr. Holbrook from 

 Chicago, sent to him sometime ago by Prof. Kirtland, and which he has kindly 

 permitted me to examine. They both are of the same length, have similar mark- 

 ings, and the same number of rows of scales. It may be a variety of Trop. 

 sipedon. 



Heterodon nasious. 



There are three specimens of Heterodon nasicus B. and G., in very excellent 

 pieservation. These Heterodons are remarkable for their prominent rostral 

 plate and bulging cheeks, giving them a physiognomy, to use the expression of 

 Prof. Scblegel, quite different from that of our ordinary Heterodons. The abdo- 

 men and under part of tail is almost entirely black. In two of the specimens the 

 vertical (frontal) plate is as broad as long, in one broader by about half a line ; 

 the shape of the vertical plate differs entirely from that of simus, but much more 

 from that of niger and platyrhynos. In a specimen of simus there are eight 

 small plates between the frontal and rostral, and the anterior nasal and su- 

 pero-nasals; in nasicus 'fourteen, in platyrhynos and niger there is but one, 

 (the azygos) immediately behind the rostral. In a specimen of niger there is 

 but one loral plate, the posterior supra-nasal (posterior frontal) passing down 

 upon the side to take the place of the upper one in simus ; and in platyrhynos 

 two. The entire length of the largest of these specimens of nasicus is one 

 foot, three inches, tail 2 inches 7 lines, circumference 1 inch 7 lines. It appears 

 to be a smaller species than simus, and much smaller than platyrhynos and 

 niger. Prof. Baird and Girard, however, give over two feet as the dimensions 

 of a specimen from Sonora. Ab. sc. 137, 1 bifid praeanal, 43 sub-caudal. In 2d. 

 137, ab. sc. sub-caud. 43. In 3d, 137, ab. sc. sub-caud. 44. 



Habitat. Rio Grande, Red River, Arkansas, Fort Webster, Sonora. 



Gen. rcmarlcs The figure in Capt. Marcy's report does not accurately repre- 

 sent this animal ; the bulging of the cheeks, a prominent characteristic, is not 

 sufiSciently shown, and the nostril is in a single plate, which is not the case. 



VENENOSI. 



Trigonocephalus contortrix. 



There are four specimens of Trigonocephalus contortrix, which present no- 

 thing very peculiar. In one of them the black color predominates greatly upon the 

 abdomen; dorsal rows of scales near the middle in all 23. In a fine specimen 

 from Pottsville, Pa., presented by Mr. C. T. Hughes, the dorsal rows are but 21, 




250 [October, 



ab. sc. 146 ; a single prteanal, 38 sub-caud. followed by 7 bifid near the posterior 

 extremity of the tail ; in the Pottsville specimen, 148 ab. sc. 1 bifid near the 

 anus, 21 single and 20 bifid plates at the end of the tail. In a 2d 142, ab. sc. 



1 bifid near the anus, 25 single and 21 bifid. la all the specimens the sub-cau- 

 dal scales are single anteriorly and bifid posteriorly. The Trigonocephali, like 

 the Crotali, have a deep pit between the eye and the nostril, in which they 

 differ from the Vipers. They have plates upon the head, unlike Bothrops and 

 several other genera, and are destitute of rattles. This serpent was first de- 

 scribed by Linnceus under the name Boa contortrix ; and afterwards by Pali- 

 sot de Beauvois, who calls it Angistrodon mokeson. It has been placed in no less 

 than five different genera, viz. : Boa, Angistrodon, Cenchris, Scytalus, and Tri- 

 gonocephalus, with three diS'erent specific names. 



Habitat. This serpent has a very wide geographical range. From N. Eng- 

 land to Florida, and the shores of the Atlantic to Alleghanies, (Holbrook) Ohio, 

 Penn., S. Carolina, Louisiana, Texas, (B. and G,) 



Crotalus conpluentus. 



There is one specimen of Crotalus, which corresponds sufficiently well with 

 Say's description of Crotalus confluentus. The spots are more crowded together 

 anteriorly than in the specimen described in Sitgreave's report ; the interspaces 

 between the first fourteen being much more indistinct than between those 

 which follow, especially the first seven which present the appearance of narrow 

 white transverse bands ; they are confluent only to a slight extent. Total 

 length including rattle, 1 foot 8^ inches ; of tail including rattle 1 inch 8 lines ; 

 of rattle 9 lines ; (4 rattles and terminal appendage) of head 1 inch, breadth 

 f ; 25 or 27 rows of scales. 178 ab. sc, a single praeanal, 1 bifid, 14 single and 



2 bifid sub-caudal, the last near the rattle ; circumference 2 inches. 40 brown 

 subquadrate spots, more or less marginated, may be counted upon the back and 

 four or five upon the tail; the last nine or teu have more the appearance of bars 

 than regular blotches. A much larger Crotalus than the above is found in 

 California, of which an excellent figure is given in Capt. Marcy's Exploration of 

 Red River, pi. 1, under the name of Crotalus confluentus. We have several 

 in the collection of the Academy, presented by Dr. Heermann, of which a 

 notice will be given in the forthcoming volume of the Pacific Railroad report, 

 under the direction of Capt. Williamson. These are of a yellowish color be- 

 neath, with brownish maculations ; the subquadrate spots upon the back a deep 

 brown bordered with orange. One of these specimens measures more than 3 

 feet in length ; 23 rows of scales. The predoninating color in the specimens, ex- 

 cept that of the dorsal subquadrate blotches, is sulphur yellow. The name of Cro- 

 talus Lecontii might perhaps with propriety be given to this species from Cali- 

 fornia, and that of confluentus be retained for the smaller crotalus with quad- 

 rate blotches, from Missouri and Kansas. The serpent figured in the Explora- 

 tion of Red River, has more the general appearance of the former, and the shape 

 of the rattle corresponds, this in confluentus tapering to a point ; and not quad- 

 rangular as in the larger animal. 



RANIDiE. 



There is in the collection a specimen of Rana halecina, which does not differ 

 in any important particular from the R. halecina found in the neighborhood of 

 Philadelphia, unless it be that in the latter the internal nares appear to be 

 larger, and the tongue more narrow. The vocal vesicles are quite distinct, the 

 pores upon the orbit conglomerated and very apparent ; others are observed 

 upon the neck and anterior part of the back, and a band extends along the 

 upper margin of each flank, from the posterior angle of the eye to near the 

 thigh; Dumeril and Bibron state, that it is with some doubt that they separate 

 this species (the halecina,) from palustris, but admit that they are, and they are 

 no doubt distinct. They are both very common in the neighborhood of Phila- 

 delphia. The Rana halecina has vocal vesicles, the palustris has none ; the 




1856.] 251 



spots as Dumeril and Bibron observe, are subquadrate in palustris, but round in 

 halecina; the thighs are very differently marked in the two species, and the 

 tympanum, as stated by the authors above mentioned, is smaller in palustris, 

 but it appears to us that the snout is more acute in the latter than in halecina, 

 being the reverse of the diagnosis as given by them. 



Rana pipiens. 



There is but one specimen of Rana pipiens in the collection, and that is abont 

 half grown. It does not differ materially from one of the same dimensions from 

 Absecom, N. J., except in the size of the tympanum, which in the Kansas specimen 

 is not more than 21 lines in diameter ; whereas in the one found at Absecom it is 6 

 lines, being the same as in a very large and full grown specimen from Buffalo, 

 New York. The general color is olive above, minutely and sparsely spotted 

 with black, with very indistinct bars of a deeper olive upon the posterior ex- 

 tremities. The mottlings below resemble each other, except that in the Abse- 

 com specimen they are of a chocolate color, and the color of the abdomen less 

 clouded ; they both appear to be females. The difference in the size of the 

 tympanum is certainly remarkable, but without a greater number of specimens, 

 we are unwilling, on that account, to give it a new specific name. Besides the 

 above, there are several other smaller specimens of the same olive color above, 

 the rows upon the posterior extremities of a darker color, the body covered 

 with minute black spots, in the youngest resembling ;lie R. conspersa of Major 

 Le Conte, which is, probably, the young of R. pipiens. According to Major 

 Le Conte, conspersa wants the ridge upon the tympanum. Under part mottled 

 as in the larger individual. 



There is a single specimen of a very small Batrachian resembling the Acris 

 gryllus, grey spotted above with the triangular spots upon the head ; thighs and 

 eyes obliquely spotted with brown ; under parts white ; length from snout to 

 posterior extremity of body G lines; length of anterior extremities 3 lines ; of 

 posterior 9J. 



BUFONID^. 



BUPO AMERIOANUS. 



There are in the collection of Dr. Hammond, two very large toads, larger than 

 any specimens of Bufo americanus that I have seen. They measure 3 inches 

 11 lines in length, (from snout to vent,) the dimensions of the Bufo ameri- 

 canus, as given by Prof. Holbrook, being but 2 J inches. The longitudinal ridges 

 upon the head are as in Americanus, and there is a narrow vertebral line running 

 from the extremity of the snout to near the posterior extremity of the body; the 

 general color is dusky above mingled with olive, with a few subround black 

 spots and linear maculations ; the black colored maculations are more distinct 

 upon the sides ; under part yellow, mingled with orange posteriorly ; the warts 

 upon the sides of the body above and upon the posterior extremities are remark- 

 able for their large size. 



The Bufo punctatus of Profs. Baird and Girard appears to be the young of 

 this species ; they are of an ash grey with subround spots, and irregular mark- 

 ings of black, containing one or more prominent red colored points or tubercles. 

 Under parts white, with a tinge of blue upon the abdomen, except posteriorly, 

 the under surface of the posterior extremities of a yellow color. I cannot make 

 out that this toad differs essentially from Bufo americanus, and in this my friend 

 Major Le Conte agrees, who also examined the specimen. 



The most striking difference between this species and the Americanus, con- 

 sists in the much greater breadth of the tongue, and its greater comparative 

 evertil'ity ; in two specimens of equal size, the tongue in the Kansas specimen 

 is six lines in breadth, in Bufo Americanus but three. In the largest specimen 

 the tongue measures 7 lines in breadth, and is somewhat less evertile th^n in 

 the smaller specimen. This species is very different from Bufo halophila, B. 

 & G., inhabiting California; the latter is much more warty, the warts being 




252 [October, 



very numerous and much developed along the middle of the back; the mark- 

 ings beneath are also different, halophila being largely maculated beneath. 



Engystoma olivacedm, Dob. 



There is a single specimen of Engystoma, one inch one line in length 

 by seven lines in breadth ; the anterior extremities 6 ; the posterior 1 inch 

 10 lines in length. The general color above is olive, with dark colored spots 

 posteriorly; these are observed in considerable number upon the poste- 

 rior part of the body and upper part of the thighs ; a few also are seen over the 

 shoulders ; the sides are obscurely marbled with brown ; under surface yellow, 

 immaculate; a well marked fold passes across the head behind the eyes, ex- 

 tending down alongside of the head. 



This specimen is larger than any of those in the collection of the Academy, 

 and the coloration is quite different from that of Dr. Holbrook's figure (N. Am. 

 Herpet. vol. v. pi. vi.,) and the specimens from Georgia in the collection pre- 

 sented by Maj. Le Conte. These are all more or less mottled with brown beneath 

 and brown or chestnut colored above. 



Dimensions. As above, length of tarsus and toes 9 lines ; of leg 4 lines ; of 

 thigh 4; of arm '2, of forearm 2. 



Gen. Remarks. Dumeril and Bibron describe five species of Engystoma two 

 from N. America, (carolinense and rugosum,) two from S. America, (ovale and 

 micropSj^and one from Malabar, (ornatum.) 



Habitat. According to Dr. Holbrook, Engystoma Carolinense has never been 

 found north of Charleston, its range extending westward to the lower Missis- 

 sippi. 



URODELA. 

 aMBYSTOMID^. 



Ambystoma luriddm, var. fasgiatum. 



There is but one specimen of Urodela, viz.,an Ambystoma. This is the same 

 animal apparently figured in Dumeril and Bibron's work, pi. 105, under the 

 name Ambystome abandes, (variete,) but it differs entirely from Ambystoma 

 fasciatum, (opacum,) not only in coloring but in the arrangement of the teeth; 

 these in fasciatum are placed in th-ee distinct groups, whereas in the present 

 specimen they are in a continuous series, forming a very obtuse angle, the 

 lateral prolongations passing behind the internal nares and terminating in a 

 line with their external margin, presenting the same arrangement as in Axa- 

 hjstoma, luridtrm., of which it is probably a variety, having nothing to distinguish 

 it from that species but the coloration. Dumeril and Bibron state that their 

 specimen was received from the neighborhood of New Orleans. 



One cannot but remark, in studying the collection of reptiles above noticed, 

 the great difference in the geographical range of the genera and species composing 

 it. The Emysdoes not exist with us, neither does a single one of the genera of 

 the lizards, unless it be Cnemidophorus. Of the innocuous serpents four are 

 common to Pennsylvania and Kansas, viz., Elaphis Alleghaniensis, Ablabes 

 triangulum, Tropidonotus ordinatus and Herpetodryas vernalis. The others, 

 viz., Tropidonotus parietalis, unless it be considered a climatal variety of si- 

 talis, Tropidonotus obliquus, Microps lineatus, Coryphodon flavivenlris, Coro- 

 nella doliata, Tantilla gracilis and lleterodon nasicus are unknown to us. The 

 genera of innocuous serpents in the collection common to Pennsylvania and Kan- 

 sas, are Elaphis, Ablabes, Tropidonotus, Coryphodon and Heterodon. Of the 

 venomous serpents, Trigonocephalus contortrix, which is one of the most widely 

 diffused of our serpents exists in both regions, but Crotalus confluentus is found 

 only in the far west and south-western portions of North America. Of the 

 Kanida?, R. halecina and pipiens are common to both, and of the Bufonida; B. 

 Americanus ; but we have no Engystoma, and among the Urodela no Ambys- 

 -oma, with an arrangement of teeth and system ef coloration in all respects 




1856.] 253 



similar to the specimen in the collection, which appears to us, as above men- 

 tioned, to be closely allied to luridum. 



We have not at present the materials for a complete representation of the 

 Herpetological fauna of America either North or South, but these will hereafter 

 no doubt present some very curious results, when compared with the fauna of 

 the West India Islands, and other parts of the globe. In order, however, to 

 arrive at the truth in a matter so important, it will be necessary to determine 

 with the utmost precision the characters both of the genera and species, and 

 this cannot be done without a knowledge of the anatomy, as well as of the ex- 

 ternal forms. 



Descriptions and Notes on Birds in the Collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia and in the National Museum, Washington. 



By John Cassin. 



1. BuTEO CooPERi, nobis. 



About the size of Buteo borealis. Bill strong, edges of upper mandible lobed, 

 wings long, quills wide, fourth quill longest, tail moderate, legs rather long, 

 tarsi feathered in front slightly below the joint, behind and remainder in front 

 naked, with about 13 transverse scales in front and 11 behind. 



Total length (skin) 21J inches, wing 15, tail 9 inches. 



Tail white at base, external feathers with their outer webs cinereous and their 

 inner webs white mottled with cinereous, other feathers of the tail mottled and 

 striped longitudinally with white, bright rufous, dark brown and cinereous, darker 

 on the outer webs. A subterminal transverse band of dark brown, tip white. 



Plumage of the head above white at base, tipped, and with longitudinal 

 stripes of brownish black ; back and rump brownish black, upper tail coverts 

 white, transversely barred with dark brown and tinged with rufous, wing coverts 

 and quills cinereous darker on outer webs of primaries and lighter on their 

 exposed ends. Under parts white, with narrow stripes of dark brown, numerous 

 on the neck, throat and flanks, (breast, abdomen and under tail coverts pure 

 white,) a few of the same on the under wing coverts, tibi faintly tinged with 

 yellowish. Bill dark bluish, tarsi yellow. 



Obs. This is the young plumage, and the present specimen is the only one 

 that I have ever seen. It is from California, and is in the collection made by 

 Dr. J. G. Cooper, while attached to Lieut. Williamson's party that surveyed a 

 route for a railroad to the Pacific Ocean. 



This bird belongs to the same group as Buteo eythronotus of South America, 

 and has nearly the same light cinereous color of the wings, quite different from 

 any other North American species. I have named it in honor of Di. Cooper, a 

 talented and active young naturalist, the son of William Cooper, Esq., one of 

 the most eminent of American Naturalists. 



2. EOPSALTRIA CINEREA, nobiS. 



Bill thick and rather long, distinctly notched near the end, wing rather long, 

 first quill spurious, fourth slightly longest, tail moderate, tarsi and toes slender, 

 feathers of the head above slightly lengthened. 



Total length (of skin) 5 inches, wing 2|, tail 2 inches. 



Entire upper parts cinereous, feathers on the head with faint lines of brown 

 on the shafts. Quills dark ashy brown, edged externally with pale ashy, tail 

 dark ashy brown, narrowly tipped with white. Throat and abdomen white, 

 breast pale ashy, under wing coverts white. Obscure line from the bill to the 

 eye, and ring around the latter, white, spot in front of the eye, dark ashy brown. 

 Bill dark, base of lower mandible white, feet dark. 



Hab. Moonda river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. DuChaillu. 



Obs. This little bird is nearer the genus Eopsaltria, than any other that I can 

 find at present, though perhaps not strictly. Two specimens in the collection 

 of Mr. DuChaillu are all that I have seen. It is a plain little bird, having the 

 general appearance of Vireo and Eopsaltria. 




254 [October, 



3. SiTTA ACULEATA, nobis. 



About the same size as Sitta caroUnensis and much resembling it, but with the 

 bill longer and much more slender. The colors of the upper parts are darker 

 than in >S^.. caroUnensis, and the white of the tail of less extent. 



Hab. California. Specimen in Nat. Mus. Washington, and Mus. Acad., 

 Philadelphia. 



Obs. This is the western style of Sitta, nearly allied to the common species 

 of the States on the Atlantic. It may very readily be distinguished by its long, 

 slender and pointed bill, which is a constant and unvarying character. Numer- 

 ous specimens are in the collections above referred to, and it appears to be a 

 common bird of the western regions of North America. 



4. ToDiRAMPHUs VARius, (Eytou,) Auctorum. 



Halcyon varia, Eyton, Proc. Zool. Soe., London, 1839, p. 101. 



Blyth Jour. As. Soc. IBengal, xv., p. 11. 



Whatever may be the bird described by Mr. Eyton as above, it is quite certain 

 that Mr. Blyth as cited, describes Halcyon concreta, Temm. PL Col. iv., pi . 346 

 The latter describes at length, and the species can readily be identified with 

 Temminck's plate, even without specimens. We regard it as quite probable, too, 

 that Mr. Eyton alludes to the same bird, and at present regard his name as a 

 synonyme for Halcyon concreta. 



This bird does not belong to the genus Todiramphiis. 



5. COLUMBA IRIDITORQUES, nobiS. 



About the size of Turtur eythrophrys. Wing rather long, quills broad, second 

 quill longest, tail rather short, feathers broad, legs short. 



Total length (of skin, male) about lOj inches, wing 6J, tail 4 inches. Female 

 smaller. 



Neck behind with a wide collar of cinnamon color, with golden violet and 

 green metallic lustre. Entire head cinereous, light on the throat and in front, 

 darker and with a green metallic lustre on the occiput, other upper parts very 

 dark, nearly black with a tinge of cinereous, and on the back and rump with 

 green and violet metallic lustre, especially next to the nuchal collar. Under 

 parts vinaceous, under tail coverts light chestnut, under wing coverts dark 

 cinereous. Two central tail feathers dark cinereous, others same color on their 

 outer webs, and dark chestnut on their inner webs, and widely tipped with yel- 

 lowish white. Legs yellow. 



Hab. St. Paul's river and Moonda river. Western Africa. Dr. MacDowell's 

 collection and Mr. DuChaillu's collection. Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada. 



Obs. This handsome species of Dove has been in the collection of the Aca- 

 demy for some years, having been collected by Dr. MacDowell, but I have never 

 succeeded in finding a name for it. It is not given in the Columbidcn of the 

 Prince Bonaparte's Conspectus Avium. 



Several specimens are in Mr. DuChaillu's collections. This species does not 

 intimately resemble any other known to me, and may be immediately recognized 

 by its wide nuchal collar, the colors of which are very brilliant. The back and 

 rump and some of the wing coverts have also brilliant metallic lustre. 



6. Zapornia umbrina, nobis. 



"Zapornia spilinota, Gould," Peale, Voy. Vincennes, Birds, p. 224. 



About the size of Z. spilonota, Gould. Bill rather long, membrane of the 

 nostril very large, wing rather long, third quill longest, tertiaries long, tail 

 short, legs moderate, toes long. 



Total length (skin) 5f inches, wing 3, tail 2 inches. 



Entire upper parts reddish brown or snuff color, darkest on the rump, which 

 color is continued on the sides below the lower edges of the wings. Under parts 

 dark cinereous, lighter on the throat, under tail coverts brownish black with 

 transverse stripes of white, under wing coverts brown edged with white, feet 

 light colored, bill darker. 



Hab. Eeejee Islands. Specimens in the collection of the U. S. Exploring 

 Expedition, (Vincennes and Peacock.) 




1856.] 255 



Obs. This bird was given in Mr. Peak's volume on the Birds and Quadrupeds 

 of Capt. Wilkes's Expedition, as Zapornia spilonota, Gould, but though very pro- 

 bably of the same genus, is distinct, and we have not found it described. 



T. Tachypetes Palmerstoni, (Gmelin.) 



Pelecanus Palmerstoni, Gm. Syst. Nat. i. p. 573, (1788.) 



Obs. This is a species quite distinct from T. aquila, and is apparently exclu- 

 sively an inhabitants of the Pacific Ocean. From that species the present bird 

 may readily be distinguished by its much larger gular pouch, which in the 

 living bird is of a red color. Its quills and tail feathers are much narrower and 

 the latter is longer. So far as can be determined from preserved specimens, the 

 two species are nearly of the same size, thongh the present bird is the more 

 slender. 



Numerous specimens are in the collection of the Exploring Expedition, 

 (Vincennes and Peacock.)

The genus was originally proposed 6n several long horn-like teeth, together 

 with fragments of jaws found in the miocene deposit of Virginia. Prof. Em- 

 mons has also discovered a tooth, apparently of the same species, in the mio- 

 cene deposite of North Carolina. The tooth bears a wonderful resemblance to 

 the horn of a young ox. It is nearly 5 inches long in the curve and over an 

 inch in diameter at base, which is hollowed into a deep conical cavity, as in 

 the spermaceti whale. 



Sauria. 



2. Drepanodon impar, Leidy. 



This species is founded on the crown of a tooth discovered by Prof, Emmons 

 in the miocene deposit of Cape Fear, North Carolina. 



The specimen, in form, bears a strong resemblance to the crown of the in- 

 ferior canine tooth of a bear, but it has only one trenchant ridge, and this is 

 situated postero-internally. The enamel is thin and smooth ; the base of the 

 crown is hollowed conically. Length of specimen 10 lines; breadth at base 

 antero-posteriorly 7 lines, transversely 5 lines. 



3. Pliogonodon priscus, Leidy. 



Founded on two much mutilated specimens, consisting of the crowns of teeth, 

 discovered by Professor Emmons in a miocene deposite of Cape Fear, in North 

 Carolina. 



Teeth elongated conical, nearly straight or only slightly curved inwardly, in 

 section circular, with a pair of opposed carinaa on the inner side ; surfaces 

 divided into numerous narrow planes, with a few vertical interrui^ted plicae, 

 which are more numerous on the inner side, ^namel finely wrinkled ; and the 

 dentine concentric. Base of crown hollowed. Probable length of crown when 

 perfect 2 inches, breadth of base |- of an inch. 



The teeth differ from those of 3fososaurus in their narrower proportion, 

 straightness, circular section, and plicae of the enamel ; from those of Polypty- 

 cliodon in the possession of divisional planes and opposed carinag ; and from 

 those of Pleiosaurus in the former character and the circular section. 



4. Pal-5:osaurus ? (Compsosaurus) priscus, Leidy : ante p. 165. 



Half a dozen isolated teeth of this saurian are contained in the collection of 

 Prof. Emmons. 




256 [October, 



5. Omosaurus perplexus, Leidy. 



An enaliosaurian, based upon a number of teeth of varied character, vertebrae, 

 fragments of ribs and other bones, and the impression of a dermal pLxte, obtained 

 from the coal field of Chatham Co., North Carolina, by Prof. Emmons and also 

 by Prof. M. Tuomey. 



Teeth elongated conical, pointed, nearly straight, or n:ore or less mo- 

 derately curved inwardly, with opposed carinte on the inner side, which 

 are entire or denticulated ; transverse section subcircular, flattened in- 

 ternally ; surfaces even, or more or less distinctly fluted on the outer side or all 

 around, and covered with minute interrupted ridges, which are vertical on the 

 even surface, oblique on the fluted surface, and divergent downward in the vi- 

 cinity of the carinas. Crown solid, enamel thin, dentine concentric ; fang sub- 

 cylindrical, hollowed at base. Length from 5 lines to 1^ inches, breadth from 

 2 lines to 4| lines. 



Bodies of the vertebrse bi-concave and much constricted, as m Palceosaw'us? 

 and Ch-jKysaunis. Length of one of the posterior cervical bodies 16 lines, 

 depth of its articular surfaces 17 lines, width 15 lines. 



Dermal plate covered with radiating, bifurcating and anastomosing ridges. 



Allied to Clepsysaurus and Centemodon, Lea, and probably identical with them. 



Labyrinthodonta. 



6. DicTYOCEPHALUS KLEGANS, Leidy. 



Founded on the upper portion of a cranium discovered by Prof. Emmons in 

 the coal-field of Chatham Co., N. C. Plates of the cranium covered with reti- 

 cular ridges in a general radiant manner. Parietals comparatively short, 

 broader in front than behind ; parietal foramen near the centre of the bones. 

 Occipitals quadrate, a little longer than broad. Posterior outline of the cranium 

 with a superficial transverse concavity on each side and not a deep sinus as in 

 Trematosaurus and Arcliegosmirus. Breadth of occipital outline 28 lines ; length 

 of parietals 8J- lines, breath anteriorly 3J lines, posteriorly 3 lines. Probable 

 length of head, considering it to have had nearly the proportions of Tremato- 

 saurus, 4 inches, breadth 2^- inches. 



Pisces. 



7. IscHTRHiZA AXTiQUA, Leidy. 



The genus was originally based on a tooth found in the Green Sand of New 

 Jersey. Two teeth aj^parently of a second speceis have been obtained by Prof. 

 Emmons on the Neuse River, N. C. 



Crown of the teeth, when perfect, apparently, laterally compressed conical. 

 Fang robust, quadrately pyramidal, curved ; with a rugged base which is bifur- 

 cated antero-posteriorly and more deeply before than behind. Pulp cavity en- 

 tirely closed at bottom. Probable length of specimens when entire IJ, and 2 

 inches; length of fang 10 lines, and 1 inch ; breadth of crown at base antero- 

 posteriorly 5 lines, 6 lines ; laterally 3| 1., 4|- 1. ; breath of fang at bottom an- 

 tero-posteriorly 7 1., 8^ 1.; laterally 6J 1 7 1. 



Notice of some Remains of Fishes discovered hy Dr. John E. Evans. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



1. Clupea humilis, Leidy. 



Founded on an impression of the fish upon one half of a clay stone nodule 

 from a tertiary deposit of Green River, Missouri. ' 



Length 3^- inches; greatest depth 16 lines. Dorsal fin with 15 rays; abdo- 

 minal 7, anal 14; caudal 20? From the head to the position of the anus 28 

 abdominal spines may be counted. 



2. Cladocyclus? occidentalis, Leidy. 



Based on specimens of isolated scales, attached to masses of an ash-colored 

 chalk, from the cretaceous deposite of the upper Missouri. 




1856.] 257 



The scales are almost the size of, and bear considerable resemblance to, those 

 of Calastomus hubalus. A nearly circular scale is about 1|- inches in diameter, 

 and an ovoidal scale has been nearly 2 inches wide and 1 inch long. Deep 

 radiant grooves mark the uncovered portion, and minute granule-like points the 

 opposed portion, while the intermediate ti-acts are smooth. 



3, Enchodus shumardi, Leidy. 



Based on the specimen of a right dental bone found in company with Clado- 

 cyclus occidentalia. The bone has been about an inch in length, and in the 

 specimen it supports a series of six large teeth, of which the first one is 2 lines 

 long and the last one | of a line. The border of the bone outside of the long 

 teeth is fringed Avith minute teetli. 



The species is named in compliment to Dr. Benj. F. Shumard, of St. Louis, 

 who assisted Dr. Evans in his important explorations. 



The Secretary announced the death of Mr. Samuel B. Ashmead, late 

 a member of the Academy.

Mr. Lea read portions of a letter from Dr. J. Lewis, dated Mohawk, 

 N. Y., October 28th, 1856, giving a list of living mollusca in " Little 

 Lakes," Otsego, County, ^N. Y. Referred to the Committee on Pro- 

 ceedings. 



" The geological character of the basin in which the upper or northern Lake 

 lies, is sufficiently explained by the out-cropping rocks of " Coriferous lime- 

 stone " that appear near its eastern and western shores. The bottom of the 

 lake was formerly, no doubt, either a stratum of the " Coriferous " or the 

 " Onondaga Limestone " of the New York Geological surveys. 



The lake is fed by a few small streams that drain a considerable extent of 

 territory of the same geological character, and it is fair to presume that a con- 

 siderable quantity of lime enters the lake in solution, where, by the influences 

 of light, heat, evaporation, and animal and vegetable life, most of the lime is 

 deposited in the form of a greenish grey mud, in which are immense numbers 

 of shells, which are perhaps the accumulation of ages, and form in the lake and 

 the surrounding marshes beds of marl, in many places over 20 feet deep. In 

 such a locality the mollusca might be expected to exhibit some unusual or 

 singular features, and such indeed is the case. 



The species that have fallen under my observation have been sought only in 

 the upper lake. The lower lake (which does not exhibit the marl of the upper 

 to any remarkable extent) is so variable in its depth, from being raised or 

 lowered to meet the requirements of a mill on its outlet, that a favorable oppor- 

 tunity for examining it has not occurred at such times as could be made availa- 

 ble. The species do not differ, so far as known, from those of the upper lake.

Characters of an apparently undescribed bird belonging to the genus Campylorhyn-

Hab. in Mexico Boreali prope Mazatlan (Bell). 



This bird nearly resembles the Campylorhynchus capistratus, of Southern 

 Mexico and Central America, figured by Des Murs in his Iconographia Ornitho- 

 logique (pi. 63), but may be at once distinguished by its diminutive size and 

 the rufous head and post-ocular stripe, these parts being black in the other 

 species. There are three specimens of it in the Academy's collection. One of 

 these was obtained by Mr. Bell, near Mazatlan, a second is marked " California, 

 Dr. GambcVs collection" and the third is one of the birds procured during the 

 voyage of the Venus, but has no locality afBxed. The Academy's collection, 

 likewise, contains six examples, which I consider referable to Camp, capistratus. 

 Four of these present the usual normal appearance of that bird, but the remain- 

 ing two are considerably inferior in size, and but slightly exceed the present 

 species in dimensions. One of these latter birds is also much spotted and 

 blotched on the lower surface, and seems to be in that state of plumage in 

 which it "^as characterized by Lesson as Picolaptes rufinucha. But as the black 

 head is persistent in all these examples, even in such as are in manifestly im- 

 mature plumage, I am induced to believe that the present bird with its rufous 

 head and size, still more diminutive than in the smallest examples of C. 

 capistratus, is really to be regarded as a distinct species. 



I think it very probable that this is the Campylorhynchus described, but not 

 named, hy Prince Bonaparte, in his Notes upon ^Delattre's collections, (p. 43.) 



The genus Campylorhynchus was established by Spix in the first volume of 

 his Birds of Brazil. In the Magazin de Zoologie in 1835, M. de Lafresnaye, pro- 

 posed to use Lesson's term Picolaptes, for the same group. This is not proper, 

 as M. de Lafresnaye has himself subsequently acknowledged, because, in the 

 first place, Spix's name has the priority ; and secondly. Lesson's term was applied 

 by him originally to a particular genus belonging to the different subfamily 

 (Dendrocolapiince) for which it should be retained, although the same author 

 subsequently described several typical members of the group as being 

 Picolaj)ta. Many species of this genus present very great similarity in plumage, 

 and from this fact and from their being considerable variation in the size and 

 coloring of individuals, in some of the species, there is often much difficulty 

 in determining them satisfactorily. 




264 . [November, 



As to the true position of the group, I quite agree with M. de Lafresnaye, who 

 first described the greater part of the species, that its natural place is among 

 the true wrens near the the genus Thryothorus, though pointing through the 

 closely-allied forms Heleodytes and Donacobius, towards the mocking-birds 

 {3Iimus.) 



The following is a list of the species of Campylorhynchus, which I consider 

 to rest on good authority : 



1. C. scolopaceus, Spix, Av. Bras. i. pi. 19, fig. 1. (Opetiorhynchus furdinus, P. 

 Max.) from Brazil : one specimen in the Academy's collection. The synonyms 

 of this bird in Prince Bonaparte's Conspectus, have been somehow mixed up 

 with those of the last species of the genus next preceding it. Spix has figured 

 it with tolerable accuracy. Turdus variegatus, of Gmelin, is] sometimes con- 

 sidered to be identical with this species. 



2. C. hyposticius, Gould, P. Z. S., 1855, p. 68, from Eastern Peru. An ally 

 of the preceding, but having the body below much more thickly covered with 

 spots. The only specimens I have seen of it were those received by Mr. Gould, 

 which were obtained by Hawkswell, on the Ucayali. 



3. C. unicolor, Lafr., R. Z., 1846, p. 53. (^Pieolapies scolopaceus, Lafr. & D'Oorb., 

 Syn. Av. in Mag. de Zool., ISST, p. 46. Anumbius scolopaceus, D'Orb. Voy., p. 

 256), from Bolivia. Two specimens of this bird are in the Academy's collection. 

 They may be distinguished from C. scolopaceus, to which they are most closely 

 related, by their nearly uniform white under-surface. 



4. C. unicoloroides (I) Lafr., R. Z., 1846, p. 316, from Bolivia. I am not ac- 

 quainted with this species. It would seem, from its curious name, to be closely 

 allied to the last. 



5. C. zonatus, (Less. Cent. Zool., t. 70.) A Mexican species not uncommon in 

 collections. The Academy possesses three examples, one of which, was ob- 

 tained by Mr. Pease, in the province of Vera Cruz. 



6. C. zonatoides (!) Lafr., R. Z., 1846, p. 92, from New Grenada. I have not 

 yet seen this bird in very perfect plumage. There is one specimen in the 

 Academy's collection probably referable to this species. 



7. G. mcgalopterus, Lafr., (Des Murs, Icon. Orn., p. 54.) A large species, re- 

 cognized by its being wholly spotted and barred with black and white. There 

 are examples in the Academy's collection, probably from Mexico. 



8. C. pallescens, Lafr., R. Z., 1846, p. 93. One specimen in the Academy's 

 collection, which I take to belong to this species, seems to be closely allied to 

 the preceding, but distinguished by its nearly uniform head, more obsoletely 

 spotted under-surface, and differently marked tail. It is labelled " Guyaquil." 



9. C. nuchalis, Cab. Orn. Notiz. in Weigm. Archiv. I., p. 206. This bird is 

 very like 0. meyaloptcrus, but much smaller in size, and with the head and 

 nape unstriped. There are examples in the Academy's collection from Vene- 

 zuela, and I have often seen it from Trinidad. 



10. C. brevirosiris, Lafr., R. Z., 1845, p. 339, from Bogota. I have not met 

 with this species. 



11. C. brunneieapillus, (Picolaptes b)'unneicapillus,Lsifv., et Cass. B. Cal. pi. 25, 

 p. 156), from Texas and Northern Mexico. There are specimens of this bird 

 and of its eggs in the Academy's collection. The latter are rather peculiar in 

 coloring, and somewhat resemble those of the European Redbreast {Erythacus 

 rubecula.)

Notice of remains of two species of Seals. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



1. Phoca Wymani. 



Remains of a Seal. Wyman, Am. Jour. Sci. x. 229. 



Phoca Wymani, Leidy. Anc. Fauna of Nebraska, 8. 



A tooth, apparently an inferior canine, from the miocene deposite of Virginia, 

 recently presented to the Academy by Prof. Tuomey, I suspect to belong to the 

 same species as the remains of a seal from the same deposite, described by Prof. 

 Wyman. 



The tooth is 14 lines long, and about as robust in its proportions as the cor- 

 responding tooth of P. barbata. The crown is 4J lines long and 3J broad at 

 base ; and it presents an anterior and a posterior ridge, of which the former is 

 denticulated, and bifurcates half way towards the base. The enamel is rugose, 

 especially towards the base of the crown internally ; and at one or two points 

 in front and behind it presents a short inconspicuous tubercle. 



2. Phoca debilis Leidy. 



A species of seal is apparently indicated by three specimens of molar teeth 

 obtained by Capt. Bowman, U. S. A., from the sands of Ashley River, South 

 Carolina. The teeth bear considerable' resemblance to the corresponding ones 

 of Otaria jubata, having small, compressed conical crowns, tuberculate in front 

 and behind, and single, long, gibbous fangs. The smallest specimen is 5J lines 

 long, and the largest, when perfect, was about an inch long. 



Descriptions of new fossil species o/ Mollusc^ collected by Dr. F. V, Hay den, in Ne- 

 braska Territory; together with a complete Catalogue of all the remains of Inverte- 

 brata hitherto described and identified from the Cretaceous and Tertiary Formations 

 of that region. 



By F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, M. D. 



Since the publication of our former papers on the Nebraska fossils, some ad- 

 ditional collections have come to hand, containing new species, which we here 

 propose to describe. Along with these we also find better specimens of some of 

 the species previously investigated by us, than those first received, so that we 

 are now able to correct a few errors into which we had been led, in consequence 

 of having only imperfect specimens to examine. The extensive material at our 

 command, also enables us to rectify some little confusion in the labors of others, 

 which doubtless resulted from the same cause. In order to do this, as well as 

 to furnish a convenient index to these Nebraska species, we append to this 

 paper a complete list of all the fossil invertebrata now known from the rocks of 

 that country. 



In glancing over this catalogue, the paleontologist will not fail to be struck 

 with the great preponderance of Lamellibranchiata, Gasteropoda, and Cephalopioda 

 over all the other invertebrate forms of life. Among all the collections we have 

 yet seen from this region, the Bryozoa are represented by but one rare species 

 of Reticidipora, and the Brachiopoda by only one species of Caprinella and one of 

 Lingula, both so rare that but a single specimen of each has been found ; while 

 of the whole great class of Echinodermata, which existed in such vast numbers, 

 and presented such an infinite variety of beautiful forms, during these epochs in 




266 [November, 



some parts of the world, we have yet only seen from this region, a single frag- 

 ment, too imperfect to give any clue to its generic relations. The paucity of 

 some, and entire absence of others, of the more common genera of Mollusca, 

 such as Ostrea, Oryphcea, Exogyra^ Sfc, in these collections is worthy of notice. 

 Future investigations, it is true, may add more species to our present meager 

 list of these rare forms, yet it is probable we have here something like an ex- 

 pression of the numerical proportions in which many of the lower types of life 

 existed in these ancient seas. 



Of the one hundred and ninety-one species enumerated in this catalogue, 

 forty-four belong to the Tertiary system, and one hundred and forty-seven to 

 the Cretaceous. None of the former are known to occur in the States, or on 

 the other side of the Atlantic, while of the Cretaceous species, nine appear to 

 be common to the Nebraska formations and those of the States, and four are 

 identical with forms occurring in the old world.* Of these nine species hav- 

 ing so great a geographical range, six, or nearly one-third of all that class of 

 Mollusca contained in the list, belong to the Cephalopoda, while nearly all the re- 

 maining one hundred and seventy-six species, which appear to be restricted to the 

 north west, belong to the Lamellihranchiata and Gasteropoda. This, however, is 

 not so surprising when we bear in mind the fact that the habits and organiza- 

 tion of these ancient Blolluscavnust have been such, from what we know of their 

 existing analogues in our present seas, that the former depended on accident, 

 or feeble locomotive organs, for their gradual distribution over the world from 

 their various centers of creation, while the Cephalopoda, owing to their superior 

 locomotive powers, were capable of wandering freely far out over the most 

 profound parts of the ocean. 



In order to convey a clear idea of the relative positions and vertical range of 

 the fossils enumerated in this catalogue, as well as of the nature and order of 

 succession of the various strata from which they were obtained, we give at the 

 end of these remarks, a more com^jlete section of the Nebraska formations than 

 has been yet published. Future investigations may, it is true, show a more 

 intimate relation between the sub-divisions represented in this section than we 

 are aware of at this time, yet so far as we now know, each one of them appears 

 to have been formed during the prevalence of physical conditions so widely dif- 

 ferent from those in existence at the time of the deposition of each of the others, 

 that not a single species of the fossils found in them seems to be common to 

 any two, excepting No. 4 and 5, and perhaps No. 2 and 3, We think, however, 

 when more is known in regard to the range of species in these rocks, it may be 

 found convenient to group them together as follows : 

 Group A. Miocene. 



" B. Eocene. 



" C. No. 4 and 5 of the section. 



" D. No. 2 and 3 " " 



" E. No. 1 " " 



At any rate, by such a classification, we would have divisions which, so far as 

 our present knowledge extends, appear to be characterized, not merely by dis- 

 tinct species, but by rather different types of fossils. 



In one of our former papers, we mentioned the fact that some of the forms in ' 

 division No. 4 resemble those of the upper Green Sand of English geologists. 

 Although this is the case, later collections appear to show that many species we 

 had supposed restricted to the upper of these two rocks, also occur in the lower. 

 In addition to this, we have more recently ascertained that Pleurotoma minor 

 (Evans and Shumard's unpublished MSS.,) as well as a species of Fasciolarmf 



* It is quite probable a few other species may yet be found in Nebraska that 

 will prove to be common to the Cretaceous rocks of that region and those of the 

 States, as well as with those of the old world. We look for them chiefly 

 amongst the Cephalopoda. 



t These genera are generally regarded as having been introduced towards the 

 close of the Cretaceous epoch. 




1856.] > 267 



perhaps identical with our F. bticcinoides, both of which were at first only met 

 with in the bed of No. 5, likewise occur in No. 4. From these facts, we are in- 

 clined to regard these two rocks as only well marked subordinate members of 

 the same natural group, which is of the age of the true chalk. 



Too few fossils have yet been found in No. 2 and No. 3 to settle very definite- 

 ly their position in the Cretaceous system, though the late discovery by one of 

 us* of Inoceramiis problematicus, near the base of the first, appears to show that 

 this bed is not, at any rate, older than the upper Green Sand, and that it may 

 also belong to the chalk. 



In our section of the Nebraska formations, given in a paper published in the 

 8th vol. of the Proceedings of the Academy, page 63, it will be remembered we 

 placed provisionally the beds of sandstone and clay composing formation No. 1, 

 seen at the mouth of Big Sioux river and below there, along with the Cretace- 

 ous strata, stating at the same time that they were not positively known to 

 belong to that system. We still think it barely possible these beds may be 

 older than Cretaceous, though if represented, as we think they are, by similar 

 beds seen holding about the same position near the mouth of Judith river, far up 

 towards the sources of the Missouri, we must either refer them to the Cretaceous 

 system, or admit the introduction of the genus Baculiies before that epoch, as we 

 have fragments of a small species of that genus from the Judith river beds. 

 At the same time it should be borne in mind that these strata at the last named 

 locality are characterized by a group of fossils remarkably distinct from those in 

 the rocks above, and that one species belongs to the genus Hettangia, a type of 

 bivalves, not known to occur, in the old world, in more modern formations than 

 those of the age of the Lias. If not older than Cretaceous, we think, from these 

 facts, as well as from the stratigraphical position of these beds, they probably 

 represent some of the older members of that system. What relation they bear 

 to the formations near the same locality, in which the saurian remains were 

 found, supposed by Prof. Leidy to be allied to the genera Iguanodon and Mega- 

 losaurus, is still an unsettled question. 



Should these Big Sioux and Judith river formations prove to be Jurassic, or 

 even to represent both the Jurassic and Triassic systems, it would not conflict 

 with the statement made by us in our last paper, that Mr. Marcou was mistaken 

 in coloring as Triassic and Jurassic the immense extent of country referred to 

 by us between these two localities, as we know this great area to be wholly 

 occupied by well marked Cretaceous and Tertiary strata, while the above 

 named doubtful beds, no whei;e come to the surface near the Missouri, between 

 these two widely separated localities, excepting for a short distance below the 

 mouth of Judith river. 



It would, perhaps, be premature to attempt, at the present time, the task of 

 tracing out in much detail the parallelism of the various members of the Cre- 

 taceous system in Nebraska, with those of New Jersey and other well known 

 districts in the States, or with those of the south western Territories ; yet the 

 occurrence of several of the more common and characteristic fossils of the upper 

 two Nebraska formations, such as Ammonites placenta, Scaphites Conradi, Bacu- 

 lites ovatus, Nautilus Dekayi, ^c, in the first and second Green Sand beds and 

 intervening ferruginous stratum of New Jersey,f as well as in the "Kotten Lime- 

 stone" of Alabama, clearly indicates the synchronism of these deposits, notwith- 

 standing their widely separated geographical positions. 



At the same time the total absence of the above named fossils, and indeed so 

 far as we yet know, of all the other species of the lowest and upper two Nebraska 

 Cretaceous formations, in the rocks from which Roemer and others collected so 

 many species in Texas, and other south western localities, renders it highly pro- 

 bable that if the latter occur at all in Nebraska they must be represented by 



* Dr. Hayden. 



f For our knowledge of the geological positions of these fossils in New 

 Jersey, we are indebted to Prof. Geo. H. Cook, of the geological survey of that 

 State. 




268 [November, 



the beds No. 2 and 3 of our section. This conclusion is further strengthened 

 by the fact that the only Nebraska species yet found in the south west, so far 

 as we know, are Inoceramus problematicus and Osirea congesta, both of which are 

 unknown in the north west excepting in the above named beds, and are mainly 

 restricted to the latter. The well marked specific characters ofthese two fossils, 

 and their limited vertical range, together with their extensive geographical 

 distribution, render the bed in which they occur a horizon of the highest 

 importance in the identification of strata at remotely separated localities in these 

 far western territories. 



That these beds, or formations of the same age, are widely distributed over a 

 vast area of country, extending from near the great bend of the Missouri in lat. 

 44 15'', long. 99 20'', westward to, and perhaps beyond, the eastern slope of 

 the Rocky mountains, and far south into Texas and New Mexico, is highly pro- 

 bable, from the occurrence of their characteristic fossils at many widely separated 

 localities in this region. At any rate, we know, from information obtained 

 through Mr. Henry Pratten, of the Geological Survey of Illinois, i\i&i Inoceramus 

 problematicus is found in a light colored limestone overlying a red sand stone on 

 Little Blue river, a tributary of Kansas River. Col.' Fremont also collect- 

 ed specimens of the same shell from a similar rock on Smoky Hill river, in lat. 

 39, long. 98, and at other localities between there and the Rocky mountains.* 

 More recently, Lieut. Abert found the same, or a closely allied species, at a point 

 as far south west as lat. 35 13' N., long. 107 2' W., and apparently on the 

 western declivity of the anticlinal axis of the Rocky mountains.f Roemer like- 

 wise collected in Texas specimens of a shell he refers to Inoceramus myteloides of 

 Mantell, which is considered identical with /. problematicus of Schlotheim. In 

 addition to this, we have seen, in Mr. Marcou's collection, specimens of Osirea 

 congesia, from Galisteo, between Fort Smith and Santa Fe, where it probably 

 holds the same geological position as the so-called Gryphcea dilatata. 



The formations from which the above named fossils were obtained Jn the 

 south western Territories, appear, from the statements of the various explorers 

 of that region, to repose on a series of red, yellow, and whitish sandstones and 

 various colored clays, which are referred by Mr. Marcou to the Jurassic and 

 Triassic systems. These lower beds we think are represented wholly, or in 

 part in Nebraska, by our formation No. 1, which, as previously stated, we re- 

 gard as probably belonging to the lower part of the Cretaceous system, though 

 it may be older. 



In the remarks accompanying our paper on the fossils of the Lignite Tertiary 

 formations of Nebraska, although satisfied they must be middle or lower Tertiary 

 types, we refrained from the expression of any opinion as to the exact age of 

 the beds in which they were found ; not having been able to identify positive- 

 ly any of the species with characteristic forms of either of these members of the 

 Tertiary system in other countries. Being all specifically distinct from previously 

 known forms, and belonging nearly exclusively to land and fresh water genera, 

 we could of course base no conclusions on comparisons with the fossils of the 

 Tertiary formations hitherto most successfully investigated on other parts of 

 this continent, since the latter deposits are almost wholly characterized by 

 marine genera. So far as we had been able to compare them with figures and 

 descriptions of foreign species, the evidence appeared contradictory, some of 

 them being like Miocene and others like Eocene types. As we now have, how- 

 ever, the additional weight of evidence derived from Dr. Newberry's investi- 

 gations of the fossil flora of these formations, in favor of the conclusion that they 

 are of Miocene age, we can no longer hesitate in referring them to that epoch. 

 Dr. Newberry's opinion on this point is worthy of the highest confidence, since, 

 in addition to an extensive and accurate general knowledge of fossil botany, 

 he has had the advantage of being able to make direct comparisons of these 

 plants with the flora of well determined Miocene deposits in California.

Descriptions of Species. 

 Natica Tuomyana, 



Shell subglobose, thick and solid ; spire not much elevated ; volutions four to 

 four and a half, convex, last one crossed by strong folds ; suture distinct or 

 slightly grooved ; surface marked with fine closely arranged lines of growth, 

 crossed by flat revolving bands ; aperture apparently ovate ; umbilicus very small 

 or only rudimentary. Length and breadth about -88 inch ; apical angle slightly 

 convex ; divergence about 110. 



We have seen but one specimen of this species, a portion of the body volution 

 of which is broken away. The outer lip seems to have been bevelled, and joins 

 the body whorl above, at an angle of about 90. The revolving bands are gene- 

 rally faint, and wider than the grooves between them on the upper part of the 

 whorls, but more distinct and about equal to, or smaller than, the depressions 

 near the middle and below. The inner lip is not callous in the umbilical region. 



This species may be at once distinguished from any other known to us from 

 the Nebraska formations, by its greater thickness, and the strong vertical folds 

 and revolving bands. We name it in honor of Prof. M. Tuomy, State Geologist 

 of Alabama and South Carolina. 



Locality and position. Mouth of Judith River, in a sandstone, probably the 

 same as No. 1 of the section. 



Bulla scbcylindrica. 



Shell elongate oval, or subcylindrical ; spire umbilicate ; surface (of cast) 

 marked with faint remains of lines of growth, crossed by about forty revolving 

 stritE, generally a little narrower than the elevated spaces between. Aperture 

 very narrow, arcuate, extending a little above the summit of the body, and in- 

 creasing in breadth very gradually from the upper to the lower extremity. Um- 

 bilicus small or closed. Length -91 inch ; breadth -48 inch. Breadth of aper- 

 ture near the centre '12 inch ; breadth at the widest place below -24 inch. 



This species, of which we have seen only a cast, is near Bulla pupa of Evans 

 and Shumard, (unpublished MSS.,) but the form of the aperture is quite different, 

 being very narrow, almost linear, excepting at the lower end, where it widens 

 out gradually, on the inner side, to about twice its breadth near the middle, 

 while that of B.pupa is " elongate ovate." From our B. volvaria (Proceedings 

 of the Academy of March last, page 69,) it may be distinguished by its larger 

 size, and the equal breadth of the two ends ; it differs from all the other 

 ISiebraska species we have seen, in its greater size and much more elongate 

 form. 



Locality and position. Near mouth of Milk River, formation No. 4 of the ac- 

 companying section. 



Panop^a occidentalis. 



Shell elongate ovate ; posterior end broader than the anterior, subtruncate 

 and gaping ; buccal end narrowly rounded, almost closed ; base straight along 

 the middle, rounding up abruptly behind, and gradually in front; cardinal 

 border nearly parallel with the base behind the beaks, and sloping in front ; 

 beaks small, rather depressed, incurved, approximate and located a little in 

 advance of the center ; surface ornamented by irregular concentric wrinkles or 

 undulations, most distinct on the upper half. 



We have but one specimen of this species, which shows none of the internal 

 characters, and has lost its finer surface markings, if there were any, by the 

 exfoliation of the external lamina. It is too imperfect to give exact measure- 

 ments, though it must have been about 3-10 inches in length, 2 inches high, and 

 1-42 inches wide. We are in some doubt whether or not it is distinct from a 

 species described by Prof. Tuomy under the name of F. cretacea, (see Proceed- 

 ings of the Academy, Sept., 1854, page 170,) though it is much larger; and it 

 is hardly probable, had his species differed much in the breadth of the two ex- 




1856.] 271 



tremities, he would have omitted to mention it. It is more narrowly rounded 

 in front than any of the casts we have seen from the New Jersey formations, or 

 than any species we have seen figured in foreign works. 



Locality and position. Sandstone near mouth of Judith River, probably No. 1 

 of the section. 



MaCTRA FORMOSA. 



Shell thin, triangular oval, somewhat compressed ; cardinal border sloping 

 from the beaks at an angle of about 115, straight in front, and slightly convex 

 behind the beaks ; extremities narrowly rounded, almost angular, nearly alike ; 

 base forming a broad regular curve ; beaks small, elevated, approximate, central 

 or a little in advance of the middle ; surface marked with fine lines of growth, 

 which become stronger and more regular on the large lanceolate lunule and 

 escutcheon. Length I'TO inches ; breadth '82 inch; height 1-36 inches. 



The lunule and escutcheon extend from the beaks to the extremities of the 

 shell, the former being slightly impressed, and the latter bounded by a very 

 obscure ridge. By grinding down upon the cardinal edge of a right hand valve, 

 we found it thin, and having under the beaks apparently an oblique cardinal 

 tooth and a small ligamentary pit, the former being divided into two diverging 

 parts ; while the anterior and posterior portions of the edge have each a long 

 groove, probably for the reception of slender lateral teeth in the other valve. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Mactra Warrenana. 



Shell triangular oval, moderately compressed ; cardinal border sloping from 

 the beaks at an angle of about 110 ; anterior end narrowly rounded ; posterior 

 end wider, rounded or very slightly truncate, and gaping a little at the ex- 

 tremity ; base forming a broad curve ; beaks elevated, rather small, incurved, 

 nearly central ; surface marked with fine lines of growth, which become stronger 

 and more regular on the large lanceolate lunule and escutcheon. Length 1-55 

 inch ; height 1-20 inch ; breadth -85 inch. 



The muscular impressions are oval or ovate; the anterior one being rounded 

 below, and contracted and prolonged above. The sinus of the palleal impres- 

 sion is small, obtuse at the extremity and nearly horizontal. 



This species is nearly related in most of its characters to the last, but may be 

 distinguished by its less compressed form, more elevated and gibbous beaks 

 and thicker shell. We have had no opportunity of comparing their internal 

 characters, nor have we seen the hinge of this species. Their distant geo- 

 graphical, and widely separated stratigraphic positions, in addition to the above 

 named differences, lead us to regard them as distinct. 



We name this species in honor of Lieut. G. K. Warren, of the U. S. Topo- 

 graphical Engineers. 



Locality and position. Yanktonin trading post, No. 5 of the accompanying 

 section. 



Mactra alta. 



Shell thin, subtriangular, compressed ; cardinal border sloping from the beaks 

 at an angle of about 80" ; base forming a broad regular curve ; extremities nar- 

 rowly rounded or subangular, and nearly alike ; posterior slope having an ob- 

 scure ridge or angle passing obliquely backwards and downwards from the beaks ; 

 umbones much elevated, (pointed ?) nearly central ; surface marked with con- 

 centric striae. Length about 2-62 inches; height 2-16 inches; breadth 1-15 

 inch. 



We have not yet had an opportunity of seeing the interior of this shell, nor the 

 details of its hinge, and all our specimens are worn so as to obscure the surface 

 markings. It resembles the last two species, but is larger and much more 

 compressed than either of them, and the much greater elevation of its beaks 

 gives it more nearly the form of an equilateral triangle. 




272 [November 



Locality and position. Bad Lands of Judith River ; in a sandstone, the posi- 

 tion of which is doubtful, but probably No. 1 of the series. 



Tellina subtoetuosa. 



Shell elliptical or narrow ovate, compressed ; anterior end rounded ; posterior 

 side obliquely truncate at the extremity, and having (in the cast) an obscure 

 ridge passing obliquely backwards and downwards from the beaks ; base forming 

 a broad curve, a little more prominent before than behind the middle ; beaks 

 small, very slightly elevated above the dorsal margin, located a little in advance 

 of the center; surface unknown. Length 2*23 inches; height 1'27 inch; 

 breadth (of left valve) about -22 inch. 



The only specimen of this species we have seen is an internal cast of a left 

 valve, with a few fragments of the inner laminte of the shell adhering. On these 

 fragments indistinct traces of radiating lines are visible, though they may have 

 had no connection with external markings. The anterior muscular impression 

 is narrow ovate, placed near the front margin, with the narrow end above, and 

 slightly inclined backwards. The posterior muscular impression is round ovate, 

 located near the upper margin, and about one eighth the entire length of the 

 shell in advance of the posterior extremity; the narrower end being above and 

 inclined obliquely forwards. Sinus of the pallial impression deep, nearly hori- 

 zontal and apparently rounded at the end. From the inward warping of the 

 back part of the lower border, and the general flatness of this valve, it is pro- 

 bable the other was more convex. 



The compressed narrow elliptical form, and slightly elevated beaks, will dis- 

 tinguish this from all the other species known to us from the Nebraska forma- 

 tions. 



Locality and position. Mouth of Judith River, from a sandstone supposed to 

 be No. 1 of the series. 



Venus ? circulaeis. 



Shell very thin, subcircular, rather gibbous ; cardinal border rounding from 

 the beaks ; extremities and base rounded ; beaks located about half way between 

 the center and the buccal border, elevated, pointed, incurved and directed ob- 

 liquely forwards ; muscular impressions very faint, anterior one almost marginal, 

 and near the beaks ; surface ornamented with fine concentric lines ; sinus of the 

 pallial impression funnel shaped, the apex being directed obliquely upwards 

 towards the beaks. Length -74 inch ; height '67 inch ; breadth -45 inch. 



Not having seen the hinge of this species, we refer it with doubt to the above 

 genus. It may be distinguished from any of the allied Nebraska forms known 

 to us, by its greatest diameter being from the beaks obliquely downwards to a 

 point a little behind the middle of the base, and by its more elevated, pointed, 

 gibbous and oblique beaks. 



Locality and position. Just above the mouth of Milk River, No. 4 of the section. 



Cttheeea pellucida. 



Shell extremely thin and fragile, broad ovate or subcircular, compressed ; 

 extremities rounded, the posterior end being a little wider than the anterior; 

 base semiovate or semicircular ; beaks moderately elevated, placed about one- 

 third of the distance from the center towards the anterior end ; surface marked 

 with fine regular concentric striaj ; muscular impressions very faint ; sinus of 

 the pallial impression triangular, longer than wide, not quite reaching the 

 middle of the shell, and if continued across would strike the opposite border 

 below the beaks. Length (of ovate variety) 1 inch ; height -83 inch ; breadth 

 40 inch. 



Amongst the shells we refer to this species, there are two varieties of form, 

 one being less compressed and more nearly circular, with more gibbous beaks 

 than the other ; but as there are some intermediate forms, and they agree in all 

 other respects, we are at present inclined to regard them as identical. More 




1856.] 273 



extensiTG collections, however, may hereafter prove them to be distinct species. 

 This shell may be readily distinguished from a species described by us in the 

 Proceedings of the Academy in April last, under the name of C. Deweyi, (page 

 83,) by its extreme thinness ; and from Venus? circularis of this paper, by its less 

 elevated and more obtuse beaks, as well as by the widely different form and 

 direction of the sinus of the pallial impression. It is more Mable to be confounded 

 with C. tenuis of Hall and Meek, {Mem. Am. Acad. Arts andSci.p. ^Q^, plate I, fig. 8,) 

 but presents in some of its varieties a more oval or ovate form, and is always 

 less broadly rounded at the extremities. In addition to these diiferences, it 

 comes from a distant locality, and from a higher bed, in which not a single 

 species known to occur in that in which C. tenuis is found, has yet been recog- 

 nized. This and the following species are referred to the genus Cytherea, chiefly 

 from external characters, as we have not seen the hinge of either. 



Locality and position. Two hundred miles above the mouth of Milk River, No. 

 4 of the series. 



Cytherea Owenana. 



Shell round oval, compressed ; beaks moderately elevated, placed about half 

 way between the center and the anterior end ; cardinal border convex behind 

 and concave before the beaks ; extremities rounded, the anal end being broader 

 than the buccal ; base semioval ;] anterior muscular impression narrow ovate, 

 and the posterior round ovate, both pointed above and very shallow ; sinus of 

 the pallial impression narrow and deep, directed obliquely upwards towards a 

 point a little in advance of the beaks. Length 1-56 inch; height 1-35 inch ; 

 breadth about -66 inch. 



The surface markings of our specimen are almost entirely carried away by 

 the exfoliation of the outer laminre of the shell. A small remaining portion near 

 the lower border is marked with small concentric wrinkles and much finer lines 

 of growth. We have not had an opportunity of examining the hinge. 



The greater thickness of the substance of the shell will at once distinguish 

 this species from all the allied Nebraska forms known to us, excepting our C. 

 Deweyi (see Proceedings of the Academy, April last, page 83) and C. orbiculata 

 of Hall and Meek, (Mem. Am. Acad. Arts and Sciences, page 382.) From the 

 former it may be known by its much deeper and relatively narrower pallial 

 sinus ; that of C. Deweyi being in the form of an equilateral triangle, and not 

 reaching the center, while in this it is about one-third deeper than wide, and 

 extends beyond the middle of the shell. They are, moreover, from distant locali- 

 ties, and widely separated stratigraphical positions. From the latter it will be 

 distinguished by its more oval and compressed form and less elevated beaks. 

 We name it after Dr, David Dale Owen, of New Harmony, Indiana. 



Locality and position. Mouth of Judith River, from a sandstone supposed to

LUCINA OCCIDENTALIS. 



? Tellina occidentalis (Morton.) Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. vol. 8, pi. si., fig. 3. 



Mould of Lucina? (Owen.) Report Wis., Iowa and Min. tab. vii., fig. 8. 



Shell rather thick, transversely oval, compressed ; cardinal border slightly 

 concave, and sloping very little in front of the beaks, convex and declining 

 behind ; anal end vertically subtruncate at the extremity, and having sometimes 

 a very obscure ridge passing obliquely backwards and downwards from the 

 beaks ; anterior end rounded and a little wider than the posterior ; base semi- 

 ovate, more prominent before than behind the middle ; beaks small approximate, 

 little elevated above the hinge, slightly in advance of the center ; lunule very 

 small, lanceolate ; surface ornamented by distinct irregular concentric lines. 

 Length (large specimen) 1'90 inchj height 1*56 inch ; breadth -94 inch. 



By breaking open some of the specimens, we find under the beaks two di- 

 verging cardinal teeth in each valve ; and in front of these one anterior lateral 

 tooth in the right valve, which fits between two smaller ones in the left. If 




274 [November, 



there are any posterior lateral teeth they must be small and remote from the 

 beaks. At the anal extremity of each valve there is one shallow muscular im- 

 pression, of an oval or subquadrate form, with a faint slender ridge passing 

 from its inner side obliquely up towards the beaks. At the buccal end 

 there is in each valve one long shallow, arcuate muscular impression, with its 

 narrower end downwards, and directed a little back, so that more than half of 

 its lower part is detached from the pallial impression. Immediately behind the 

 upper end of this, a second very small circular muscular impression may be 

 seen in each valve. The ligament was chiefly external, and occupied a narrow 

 lanceolate depression behind the beaks ; a portion of it, however, was partly 

 internal, being deeply seated between the beaks. Exfoliated specimens show 

 on the internal laminae of the shell, faint radiating lines, which are never visible 

 on the surface. 



From the foregoing description it will be seen this species unites characters 

 belonging to two genera. Its form and general appearance, as well as its hinge, 

 and elongated anterior muscular impression, partly detached from the pallial 

 line, are all characters that would place it in the genus Lucina; while its double 

 anterior muscular impressions indicate an affinity to the genus Corbis of Cuvier. 



We are in doubt whether or not this is the shell figured by Dr. Morton under 

 the name of Tellina occidentalis. Although certainly not very nearly like his 

 figure, it resembles it more than any other shell we have seen in all the Nebraska 

 collections. It cannot be a Tellina, as the pallial impression is unquestionably 

 simple. 



Locality and position. Near Milk River, and eighty miles above on the Mis- 

 souri, also on the Yellowstone and Moreau rivers. Formation No. 4 of present 

 section. 



Hettangia Americana. 



Shell rather thick, ovate or subrhomboidal, compressed ; posterior end much 

 broader than the anterior, obliquely subtruncate and gaping ; buccal side long, 

 rostrated and closed, very narrowly rounded at the extremity ; base forming an 

 elliptical curve, excepting near the anterior end, where it is slightly contracted ; 

 dorsal border elevated in the umbonal region, concave in front and convex 

 behind ; beaks small, approximate, located a little behind the middle, surface 

 marked with rather faint lines of growth, and sometimes, near the border, with 

 small obscure concentric wrinkles. Length 2'63 inch; height l-VG inch; 

 breadth 1-25 inch. 



We have but one specimen of this species showing the hinge. This is a left 

 valve, in which there is one strong cardinal tooth located very slightly in ad- 

 vance of the point of the beak. Immediately behind this tooth, and directly 

 under the beak, there is a distinct pit, from which a shallow depression passes 

 round the upper side of the tooth. This pit was doubtless occupied by a strong 

 tooth in the other valve. The posterior lateral tooth is prominent, obtuse and 

 compressed, while the cardinal edge between it and the depression under the 

 beak is somewhat callous. 



This shell is closely related to two or three of the species figured by Terquem 

 in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of France, (2d ser. t. x. pi. 1, 2,) but is 

 relatively higher in the umbonal region, and more distinctly rostrated in front 

 than any of them. It is also more strongly truncate behind than any of Ter- 

 quem's species, though it varied somewhat with age in this character. 



It is an interesting fact that this, the first species of the genus recognized in 

 this country, is found associated with a small Baculite, while all its known con- 

 geners in the Old World are peculiar to the Lias. 



Locality and position. No. I. Mouth of Judith River. 



CaRDIUM SPECIOStJM. 



Shell circular or round oval, higher than long, gibbous in the central and 

 umbonal regions ; buccal border a little more rounded than the anal ; base regu- 

 larly rounded ; beaks elevated, slender, pointed, incurved and nearly central, 




1856.] 275 



very slightly oblique ; surface ornamented with numerous simple, slender, ra- 

 diating costce, alternating with rows of elevated points of about their own 

 breadth; border crenulated? Length -57 inch; height -Sir inch; breadth -48 

 inch. 



In different conditions of weathering the surface markings of this species 

 present a variety of aspects. In some cases the elevated points look as though 

 arranged on costae, instead of between them, while in other instances only the 

 costse are to be seen. Usually, however, these elevated points are quite distinct 

 on casts, and so regularly disposed that worn fragments, when seen embedded 

 in the matrix, present much the appearance of bits of Fenestella, On some 

 specimens traces of fine concentric stri are visible, curving strongly up- 

 wards in crossing the ribs. The shell is so nearly equilateral, and the beaks so 

 slightly oblique, that when viewed on the side it looks much like a BracMopod. 

 We know of no species with which this is liable to be confounded, amongst all 

 the Nebraska shells, and it differs from the allied forms we have seen figured 

 from foreign localities, in having the rows of elevated points of uniform size, 

 and not alternately larger and smaller. 



Locality and position. Bad Lands of Judith River, from a sandstone, the posi- 

 tion of which is doubtful, but probably No. 1 of the series. 



NUCULA OBSOLETASTRIATA. 



Shell thick, oval ovate or elliptical, moderately compressed ; surface orna- 

 mented with fine concentric strife and obscure traces of small closely arranged 

 radiating lines ; buccal end obliquely truncated from the beaks forward to a 

 point nearly half way down the front border, where it is narrowly rounded ; 

 posterior end more broadly rounded ; base semiovate, most prominent behind 

 the center; cardinal border sloping from the beaks at an angle of about 120*'. 

 Beaks small, rather depressed, nearly touching, and placed a little in advance 

 of the middle; lunule narrow ovate, deeply impressed. Length 1-20 inch; 

 height -81 inch ; breadth -60 inch. 



The cardinal edge is thinnest near the beaks, from which point it gradually 

 thickens towards the extremities, especially towards the posterior end. We 

 have had no opportunity of ascertaining whether or not the edge of the lower 

 border is crenulated. As the radiating striae are very obscure, it is probable 

 they are obsolete on worn specimens, though on the surfaces of internal laminae 

 they are usually quite distinct. The anterior muscular impression is deeply 

 impressed, of a narrow ovate form, and placed near the edge of the buccal ex- 

 tremity ; while the posterior one is a little narrower, less deeply impressed, and 

 located close up under the back end of the hinge. There are about thirty hinge 

 teeth in each valve behind, and nearly half as many before the beaks, all of 

 which are curved in crossing the edge, so as to present the concave sides to- 

 wards the extremities. 



This species will be easily distinguished from all the others known to us from 

 the Nebraska formations, by its larger size and other obvious characters. 



Locality and position. Great Bend of the Missouri, No. 4 of the series. 



CuCULLiEA EXIGUA. 



Shell thick, very small, oval cordiform ; posterior end obliquely truncate; 

 anterior extremity rounded ; base nearly straight ; ligament area rather short 

 and straight, marked with longitudinal lines, and in the middle with exceedingly, 

 small, regular, closely set transverse striae. Umbonal region gibbous. Beaks 

 elevated, incurved, rather distant, and located a little in advance of the center. 

 Surface ornamented by irregular concentric wrinkles, and very fine lines of 

 growth, crossed by small, regular, faint, closely arranged radiating striae. Length 

 30 inch ; breadth 27 inch ; height 2'7 inch. 



The ligament area, which is not much more than half the entire length of the 

 shell, is often bounded by a slightly elevated border. That portion of it marked 

 with transverse striae is margined by a fine impressed hair line, and has in each 

 valve a broad triangular form. The longest sides of these two triangles are 



21 




276 [November, 



joined together at the hinge, when the valves are united, while the opposite 

 angles terminate immediately under the beaks. Muscular impressions shallow, 

 ovate or oblong, and having a very slightly elevated line passing from the lower 

 inner border of each up towards the beaks. Lateral teeth of the hinge oblique, 

 but not horizontal. The beaks are curved at right angles to the hinge, and 

 slightly angular behind. A neat little shell, not apt to be confounded with any 

 other species known to us. 



Locality and position. Quite abundant at the mouth of Milk River, in formation 

 No. 4 of the series. 



Mytelus subarcuatus. 



Shell narrow ovate, arcuate ; posterior end compressed and rounded ; dorsal 

 edge regularly arched and sharp ; base nearly straight or slightly arcuate, 

 scarcely carlnated ; the two edges converging towards the nearly straight, 

 pointed beaks, at an angle of about 35. Surface unknown. Length 1-03 inch: 

 breadth -27 inch ; height '36 inch. 



Tlie beaks are nearly or quite terminal, and appear to have been straight or 

 but slightly declining. Our specimen being only an internal cast, shows none 

 of the surface characters, excepting traces of concentric lines of growth. The 

 dorsal border looks as though it had formed a regular curve, without any angle 

 marking the posterior termination of the hinge. 



This species is very near M. lanceolatus of Sowerby, (Min. Con. pi. 439, fig. 2,) 

 but is proportionally wider behind, and not quite so pointed at the beaks. It 

 is about intermediate in form between that species and M. edentulus of the same 

 author. 



Locality and position. Dog River, near mouth of Judith River, from sandstone 

 supposed to be No. 1 of the series. 



Gervilia subtortuosa. 



Shell thick, lanceolate, tortuous and laterally curved. Beaks terminal? 

 pointed ? posterior end narrow, the widest part being at the back end of the 

 hinge ; hinge line straight, forming an angle of about 20 with the longitudinal 

 axis of the shell; ligament fossaj about six, nearly equalling the spaces between. 

 Surface unknown. 



Our specimens of this shell consist of fragments, from which it is impossible 

 to make out a complete diagnosis of the species. None of them show the hinge 

 teeth, and they have all lost the surface markings. The largest fragment we 

 have seen (which is imperfect at both extremities) is four inches in length by 

 1-65 inch in height at the posterior end of the hinge. It retains 2*'70 inches 

 in length of the hinge, which is "44 inch in thickness, though some of the outer 

 lamina; are wanting, and shows five of the ligament fossae, of which there may 

 have been one or two more. 



When viewed on the side, the outline of this shell is much like G. avicidoides 

 of Sowerby, (Min. Con. vol. 6, page 16, pi. 511,) but it is much more curved 

 and twisted, though not so much so, nor so obtuse at the anterior extremity as 

 Gervilia (^Gastrochcena) tortuosa of the same author. So far as we know, this is 

 the first species of the genus described from the cretaceous rocks of this country. 

 Prof. Tuomy informed us he has found a species in Alabama, but as he has not 

 yet published a description of it, we have no means of instituting a comparison. 



Locality and position. Three hundred miles above Fort Union, on the Missouri, 

 No. 4 of the series. 



Inoceramus pertenuis. 



Shell very thin, broad ovate or oval, somewhat compressed ; cardinal border 

 straight ; anterior end rounded ; posterior extremity broad, obtusely rounded ; 

 base broadly curved. Beaks near the anterior end, rising above the hinge line, 

 nearly touching. Surface irregularly and rather faintly undulated, marked 

 with fine lines of growth. Length about 4-30 inches; height 3-40 inches; 

 breadth 2-20 inches, 




1856.] 277 



It is possible this shell may prove to be only a variety of /. veniricosus, de- 

 scribed by us from the same locality, in a paper read before the Academy last 

 April. It differs, however, from all the specimens we have seen of that species, 

 in being broader, much more compressed and more regularly marked with con- 

 centric undulations. The beaks are also smaller, more elevated above the hinge 

 line, and located a little further back from the anterior margin. It has likewise 

 much the form of /. convexus of Hall and Meek, (vol. 5, Mem. Am. Acad. Arts and 

 Sc. page 386, pi. 2, fig. 2,) but may be at once distinguished from that and /. Sa- 

 gensis of Owen, as well as from all the other species we have seen from the higher 

 formations of Nebraska, by the extreme thinness and entire fibrous structure of 

 the shell. 



Locality and position. Mouth of Judith river, in a sandstone probably the same 

 as No. 1 of the series. 



Inoceramus incurvus. 



Shell ovate, globose or cordiform, equivalve. Beaks located a little behind 

 the anterior end, strongly incurved ; umbonal region very gibbous and much 

 elevated above the hinge line. Surface ornamented with regular distinct con- 

 centric undulations, strongest near the beaks, where they are directed very ob- 

 liquely inward toward the hinge, in passing round from the front to the poste- 

 rior side. Length unknown ; breadth 2 inches ; height 1-80 inch. 



The young of this species, judging from the curve of the undulations near 

 the beaks, must have been of an ovate form, being a little broader behind than 

 in front. As the shell advanced in age it became rapidly more globose, and the 

 beaks curve so strongly inwards, as to bring the umbonal regions of the two 

 valves nearly, if not quite, in contact behind and above the points of the beaks, 

 which are directed away from each other. The substance of the shell is com- 

 posed of an external fibrous, and an internal lamellar portion, the former being 

 generally exfoliated. The surface was probably marked with concentric striae, 

 though not preserved on our specimen. This shell may be distinguished from 

 all the other species we have seen from this region, by its more globose form, 

 as well as by its strongly incurved and gibbous umbones. 



Locality and position. Little Bear's village, between Fort Pierre and Fort 

 Clark, formation No. 4. 



OSTRiEA PATINA. 



Shell circular, oval or ovate, oblique, rather compressed. Superior valve 

 concave above, thin, excepting at the beaks, where it is suddenly thickened and 

 truncate. Inferior valve thicker, concave on the inner or upper side, sometimes 

 auricled ; beaks triangular, flat, slightly curved upwards and turned a little to- 

 wards the anal side. Muscular impression oval or circular, shallow nearest the 

 anal roargin. Surface of both valves marked with imbricating lines of growth, 

 and faint irregular concentric undulations. Greater diameter of largest speci- 

 men (inferior valve) 3-50 inches; smaller do. 3-10 inches; depth of concavity 

 70 inch. 



The usual form of the shell is nearly circular or broad ovate. The buccal 

 side is short and rounded, while the anal border is longer and sometimes (espe- 

 cially in the inferior valve) contracted above just behind the beaks. The areas 

 of both valves are broad triangular, and as usual depressed in the middle, and 

 transversely striate. 



This species is evidently related to 0. vissicularis (Lamk.) of which it may be 

 considered a far western representative. It always differs from that species, 

 however, in having the inferior valve much less concave, more distinctly auri- 

 cled, and never characterized by a posterior lobe. The beak of this valve is 

 also much less curved upwards, being often almost horizontally flattened. We 

 have some fifteen or twenty specimens of this species, in a good state of preserva- 

 tion, all of which are quite uniform in their characters. None of the beaks show 

 marks of the fracture by which the shell became detached. 



Locality and position. Two hundred miles above the mouth of Milk River, No. 

 4 of the series.

Note. This mark (|| ) indicates that the species is also known to occur in the States ; 

 this () that it is common to this country and the old world ; and these two (||) that 

 it occurs both in the States and on the other side of the Atlantic. 



* "We place this species in the list of Nebraska Fossils, on the authority of Dr. Morton, 

 (see Belemnites mucronatus, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sc. vol. 8, p. 211) not having recognized it 

 in any of the collections we have seen from that region. 



f Adult specimens of this shell almost equal in size the largest individuals of A- 

 placenta, with which species it is apt to be confounded. They may always be distin- 

 guished, however, by external characters, even when the septa cannot be seen ; the 

 dorsal margin of the former being thin and sharp, especially in young individuals, 

 while that of A. placenta is always flattened immediately on the edge. It is a little 

 remarkable that Dr. Dekay's original description agrees more nearly with this shell 

 than with that referred by Morton and others to A. placenta, while his figure is more 

 like the latter. Possibly he may have had fragments of both species before him. 



Suspecting our Nebraska shell might be identical with a species indicated by Prof. 

 Tuomy, from Mississippi, under the name of A. lobatus, we sent him drawings of one of 

 our specimens, showing its form and all the details of the septa, since which he writes 

 he has no doubt of their identity. As the name lenticularis was previously applied to 

 one or two other species, that given this shell by Prof. Tuomy will have to take pre- 

 cedence, though published after Dr. Owen's. 



f Having at first only unsatisfactory fragments of this and the following species, we 

 were much puzzled in regard to their afiinities, and referred them provisionally to the 

 genus Aneyloceras. Better specimens recently received, prove them to be Turrilites.

* Of this truly protean species we have a fine collection of beautiful specimens from 

 the same locality and position as those investigated by Dr. Owen. These we find agree 

 in all respects with his figures, and only differ from his descriptions in always exhibit- 

 ing, when the matrix is cleared out from the umbilicus, six or seven volutions, instead 

 of one and a half to three and a half. A critical comparison of our specimens, with 

 Dr. Owen's figures and Dr. Morton's original specimens in the cabinet of the Academv 

 at Philadelphia, as well as with others from Alabama, loaned us by Prof. Winchell, 

 leads us unavoidably to the conclusion, that they all belong to one exceedingly variable 

 species, in which opinion Mr. Conrad, who has looked over our specimens, concurs 

 with us. A. Nebrascensis, A. Moi-eauensis, and A. Cheyennensis of Owen, are the inner 

 volutions of one strongly marked variety having a larger umbilicus, narrower volutions 

 and stronger costse. It is diflficult to believe this is not a distinct species, yet after 

 a very cai-eful comparison, we cannot see any difference between the septa of shells 

 having these characters, and those of well marked specimens of S. Conradi. 



f We have perfect specimens of this species, which prove it to be a true Scaphite. 

 Like S. Conradi, it invai'iably shows, when the matrix is removed from the umbilicus, 

 about seven volutions. When divested of the outer whorls, it is so nearly like Dr. 

 Morton's figures of his Ammonites ahyssinus, that we cannot see the slightest difference ; 

 the perforate character of the umbilicus in the specimen figured by him, being proba- 

 bly due to accident. The lobes of the septa of this species are very nearly like those 

 of S. comprimus of Owen, yet we have seen no intermediate gradations of extei-ual form 

 connecting those two, like those between the different varieties of & Conradi. We find 

 it exceedingly diflficult to define limits between species amongst these Nebraska 

 Scaphites. The position and relative size of nodes and costa3, as well as the more or 

 less compressed form of the shell and relative size of the umbilicus, are not, within a 

 considerable range of limits, characters that can always be relied upon. One of our 

 specimens of S. nodosus, (Owen) for example has near the dorso-lateral margin of one 

 side, the usual row of nodes, and none at all on the other.

Birds of South-eastern Indiana. 

 By RuFus Haymond, M. D. 



Genus HALLETUS, Sav. 



HALiiETua LEUCOCEPHALUS, Linn. The Bald Eagle. 



A few of these noble birds still linger in this section of the country. I have 

 observed one or two of them each winter for the last twenty-five years. They 

 are rarely seen at any other season of the year. 



Genus PANDION, Sav. 



Pamdion Hali^tus, Linn. Osprey, or Fish Hawk. 



Common during spring and autumn, but more abundant during the latter 

 season. 



Pandion Washinqtonii. Bird of Washington. 



Falco Washingtonii, Aud. 



This bird has been observed on white Water River by some of our older citi- 

 zens, every fall and winter for more than forty years. I have myself observed 

 one or more of them almost every winter for more than twenty years. Their 

 habits being almost identical with those of the Osprey, I have placed them, 

 without any other authority, in the same genus. 



Genus FALCO, Linn. 



Palco palumbarius. Goshawk. 



These hawks are quite numerous in all the wooded districts of the western 

 country. 




1856.] 287 



Falco COL0MBARIDS, Wil. The Pigeon Hawk. 



I have occasionally seen a fe-w of these hawks following the flight of pigeons 

 in their migrations. I have no recollection of ever having seen them, except 

 when these birds were very abundant. 



Faloo sparverius. The Sparrow Hawk. 

 This beautiful little falcon is quite numerous. 



Falco fuscus. Long-tailed Hawk. 

 Probably the most numerous of all the hawks in this section of the country. 



Falco purcatus. The Swallow-tailed Kite. 

 I hare never seen but a single specimen of this Kite, which was shot eleven 

 miles below Brookville. It had been feeding upon beetles and the eggs of the 

 cat bird, (Mimus lividus,) which it had swallowed without breaking. 



Genus BUBO, Sibbald. 

 ^ Bubo ViRaiNiANUs. The Great Horned Owl. 



This powerful species is rather numerous, probably as much so as any other 

 owl. 



Genus BPHIALTES. 

 Ephialtes asio, Linn. Screech Owl. 

 This little owl is quite common. 



Genus STRNIUM, Savigny. 



Syrnium nebulosum. The Barred Owl. 

 Quite numerous in all the timbered country, though by no means so numerous 

 as they formerly were. 



Genus CATHARTES, Linn. 

 Cathartes aura. The Turkey Buzzard. 



Numerous throughout the country at all seasons of the year. This is the only 

 vulture I have ever observed in this section of country. 



Genus CAPRIMULGUS, Linn. 



Caprimulgus vociperus, Wilson. Whip-poor-will. 

 These noisy birds are very numerous all over the country. 



Qaprimulgus Virginianus. Night Hawk. 



Quite a number of these birds appear here in May, and after remaining two 

 or three weeks, disappear, and return in largely increased quantities during the 

 month of September. 



Genus HIRUNDO, Linn. 

 HiRUNDO PELASGiA. The Chimney Bird. 

 The most numerous of all the swallows. They are the last to arrive in the 

 spring, but remain from four to six weeks longer than any other species. 



HiRUNDO LUNiPKONS. Republican or Social Swallow. 

 Hirundo lunifrons, Say. 

 Hirundo opifex, Clinton. 



This species has been quite numerous since the summer of 1849, when, for 

 the first time, they built their nests in this (Franklin) County. Prior to that 

 time I had occasionally seen them passing through the country ; they are now 

 the most numerous of all the swallows, except the chimney bird, 




288 [November, 



HiRUNDO RCPA. The Barn Swallow. 

 These swallows are quite numerous, and rank in this respect next to the gourd 

 swallow. 



HiRUNDO RIP ARIA. Bank Swallow. 

 Numerous along all the streams with abrupt sandy shores ; next in numerical 

 strength to the barn swallow. 



HiRUNDO PURPUREA. The Martin. 

 Quite common, but not so numerous as the sand martin. 



HiRUNDO BicoLOR. White-belUcd Swallow. 

 Last May (1856) I shot one of these birds, which is the only one of the kind 

 I have ever seen, or the only one I have recognized as certainly belonging to 

 that species. 



Genus ALCEDO, Linn. 

 Alcedo alcyon, Aud. The Belted King Fisher. 

 This king fisher is quite numerous along all our streams at all seasons of the 

 year. It is the only king fisher we have. 



Genus MELLISUGA, Briss. 

 Mellisuga colubris, Linn. Ruby-throated Humming Bird. 

 Very abundant throughout the whole State. We have no other humming 

 bird. 



Genus CERTHIA, Linn. 



Certhia familiaris, Linn. Brown Tree-creeper. 

 Occasionally seen, though not numerous. 



Certhia varia. Black and White Creeper. 

 Very numerous. 



Genus SITTA, Linn. 

 SiTTA Carolinensis, Lath. The Nut Hatch. 

 This familiar bird is very numerous, and known to all our citizens by the 

 name of " Tom-tit." 



Genus TROGLODYTES, Vieillot. 

 Troglodytes ^don, Vieill. The House Wren. 

 This wren is quite numerous in this country ; it, however, rarely builds its 

 nest about houses, but usually in the hollows of trees and logs. 



Genus SYLVIA. 



Sylvia troglodytes, Aud. Winter Wren. 



Frequently seen in fall and winter, but seldom or never at any other season. 



Genus TURDUS, Linn. 

 TuRDUS RUFUS. Ferruginous Mocking Thrush. 

 This is a very common bird, and the best imitator of the whole family, except 

 the mocking bird. 



TuRDUs migratorius, Linn. The Robin. 

 This is much the most numerous of all the Thrushes, at all seasons of the 

 year ; more numerous, however, in fall and winter than at any other period. 

 About six years ago they collected in vast multitudes about twenty miles south- 

 east of this place, (Brookville,) roosting on the trees together as the pigeons 




1856.] ' 289 



are in the habit of doing. Many thousands of them were killed by ruthless 

 "pot-hunters." 



TuRDUs MUSTELiNus, Gmel. The Wood Thrush. 



Numerous all over the wooded districts of the Western country. The male 

 and female sit by turns upon the eggs during the period of incubation. Of all 

 the thrushes, its notes, though not so varied as some of the others, are the most 

 beautiful, clear and full varying from those of the flute, through many tones 

 impossible to describe, ending with a kind'of metallic vibratory sound, which, 

 to be understood, must be heard. 



TuRDUs POLYGLOTTUS, Wil. The Mocking Bird. 

 This celebrated songster, occasionally, though seldom, stays this far north. 

 I have seen a few and heard the notes of a few others here within the last thirty 

 years. 



TuRDUs LiviDus, Linn. The Cat Bird. 

 This is a very common species all over the West. I have seen them in 

 numbers as far north as St. Paul, in Minnesota, in the month of October. 



TuRDUS AQUATicus, Wil. Water Thrush. 



This little thrush is very numerous in the vicinity of all our streams. 



TuRDUS soLiTARius, Wil. ? Hermit Thrush. 



The bird to which / appli/ this name is so similar in appearance to the wood 

 thrush, that for a long time I confounded the two ; and I am by no means certain 

 that I am correct in applying to it the name of Hermit Thrush. 



Genus TYRANNUS, Cuv. 



Tyrannus intrepidus, Vieill. The King Bird. 



Numerous, and the last of the summer birds reaching this section. They are 

 said to eat bees, and probably do, but I have never been able to find any in the 

 stomachs of those I have killed and examined. 



Genus TYRANNULA, Swains. 



Tyrannula crinita, Linn. Great Crested Fly-catcher, 

 Very common here, and all over the West. 



Tyrannula nunciola. Pewee. 



Numerous, and the first of the migratory birds to make its appearance in the 

 spring, usually arriving about the first of March. 



Tyrannula virens, Linn. Wood Pewee. 

 Probably more numerous than the common Pewee. 



Tyrannula Traillii, Aud. Traill's Fly-catcher. 

 I have never seen but a few of these birds. 



Genus SETOPHAGA, Swains. 



Setophaga BUTiciLLA, Gmel. American Redstart. 



This beautiful bird may be seen almost any day in deep woods during the 

 months of May and June. 



Genus CULICIVORA, Swains. 

 CuLicivoRA CERULEA. Bluc Gray Gnat-catcher. 

 The most numerous of all the fly catching tribe. 




290 [November, 



Genus MFSCICAPA, Linn. 



MusciCAPA OLivACBA, Wils. Red-eyed Greentit. 

 These birds are so numerous, that a traveller through our woods is scarcely 

 ever out of the sound of their voices. 



MusciCAPA CANTATRix, Wils. White-eyed Fly-catcher. 



Very numerous. 



Genus SYLVIA. 



Sylvia solitaria, Wils. Yellow Warbler. 



Very common. 



Sylvia estiva. Blue-eyed Yellow Warbler. 



Quite numerous. 



Sylvia pensilis, Aud. Yellow-throated Warbler. 



Quite common. 



Sylvia maculosa, Aud. Black and Yellow Warbler. 



Not very numerous. 



Genus SIALIA, Swains. 



Sialia Wilsonii, Swains. The Common Blue Bird. 



This interesting and familiar bird is very numerous and remains with us the 

 whole year round. 



Genus PARUS, Linn. 



Parus atricapillus, Linn. Black-capped Chickadee. 

 This sprightly little bird is very common. 



Parus bicolob, Wils. Great-crested Chickadee. 

 Also numerous, but probably not so much so as the preceding species. 



Genus LANIUS, Linn. 

 Lanius excubitoroides. Swains. Gray Shrike. 

 Occasionally seen in autumn and winter. In Nov. 1854, whilst hunting for 

 quails, I saw a Butcher Bird, flying with a Goldfinch (Chrysomitris tristis) in 

 its talons. A short time afterwards, going in the direction which it flew, I dis- 

 covered it upon a small elm tree, having suspended the bird by sticking its neck 

 into the cleft of a split limb, and from which it was pulling ofl" pieces and eating 

 at its leisure. The idea instantly occurred to me that the habit this bird has of 

 sticking pieces of flesh and insects upon thorns and other sharp substances, 

 may be accounted for upon the ground that they do it as a matter of conveni- 

 ence in eating (saving the labor of holding them with their feet, which are rather 

 feeble,) and not for the purpose of decoying other birds, as many have supposed. 



Genus CYANOCORAX, Boie. 

 Cyanocobax cristatus, Linn. Blue Jay. 



Very numerous, and so tame that they very frequently build their nests in the 

 fruit trees and lilac bushes, in the town, close to our doors. 



Genus CORVUS, Linn. 

 CoRvus corax. The Raven. 



Formerly very numerous, but now exceedingly rare, so much so, that I have 

 seen but one for eight or nine years. 



CoRvus Americanus, Aud. American Crow. 



Quite numerous in warm weather, both winter and summer, but never seen 

 in times of extreme cold. 




1856.] 291 



Genus STURNELLA, And. 



Sturnella ludoviciana. The Meadow Lark. 



This bird is quite abundant here, but vastly more numerous in the north 

 western part of the State, and in all other prairie countries where I have been, 

 they seem to be the most numerous bird, except, perhaps, the Red-winged 

 Blackbird. I can see no difference between this bird and the lark called S. 

 neglecta. They are probably the same. 



Genus QUISCALUS, Vieill. 



QuiscALUs VERSICOLOR, Aud. Crow Black Bird. 



These birds are very numerous except in winter. They are among the first 

 to arrive in the spring. They build their nests always in the hollow tree tops. 

 About the middle of June to the first of July they collect in flocks, and move off 

 to the North, and we see no more of them until October, when they again make 

 their appearance in large flocks, and move off southward. 



QuiscALus FERRUGiNEUs, Aud. Rusty Gracker. 

 Frequently seen in spring and fall. 



Genus ICTERUS. ^ 



Icterus pecoris, Aud. Cow Bunting. 



I have never known this bird to breed here. They are frequently seen in 

 spring and autumn during their migrations. 



Genus XANTHORNUS, Cuv. 



Xanthornus varius, Gmel. Orchard Hangnest or Oriolo. 



This lively and noisy bird is very abundant. During the breeding season the 

 male sings almost without intermission. 



Genus YPHANTES, Vieill. 



Yphantes Baltimore, Linn. Baltimore Oriole. 



This beautiful bird is very numerous in all the country west of the Alleghany 

 Mountains. I am of opinion that the song of the bird here, varies a little from 

 the song of those found in Virginia, though in all other respects they seem to be 

 identical. 



Genus AGELAIUS, Vieillot. 



Agelaios phqeniceus, Linn. Marsh Blackbird. 



Very numerous in the neighborhood of all swamps and streams. In the north 

 western part of the State they are found in almost countless numbers. 



Genus DOLICHONYX, Swains. 



DoLiCHONTX ORYZivoRUS, Linn. Wandering Rice Bird, Bob-o-link. 



I have, in three or four different years, seen a few of these birds in the months 

 of May and June. They never breed here. 



Genus CARDINALIS, Bonap. 

 Cardinalis Virginianos. Grosbeak, Red Bird. 

 Numerous all through the country. 



Genus PIPILO, Vieill. 

 PipiLO erythropthalmus, Linn. Towke Ground Finch. 

 Quite abundant.

Genus PYRANGA, Vieill. 



Pyranga rubra, Linn. Black-winged Tanager. 

 This beantiful species is very numerous tlirough all our woods. It is the only- 

 one of this genus found here, so far as my knowledge extends. The Summer 

 Red Bird I have never seen. 



Genus BOMBYCILLA. 

 BoMBYCiLLA Carolinensis, Aud. Cedar Bird. 



These birds are quite common all seasons of the year. They breed from June 

 to September. 



I have seen but three of their nests, two in June and one with young about 

 the middle of September. All three of these were upon shade trees which line 

 the main business street of the town, under which hundreds of people were con- 

 stantly passing. 



' Genus FRINGILLA, Linn. 



Pringilla ludoviciana, Wil. Rose-breasted Grosbeak. 



This beautiful bird is not very numerous, but may occasionally be found in 

 thick woods adjoining open ground, rarely seen in other places. 



Fringilla rufa, Wils. Fox colored Finch. 



Very numerous during winter, keeping company with the common Snow- 

 bird. 



Fringilla tristis, Wils. Thistle Bird, Flax Bird. 

 Breeds in July August and September, and is very numerous. 



Fringilla socialis, Wils. House Sparrow. 

 Exceedingly numerous. They remain with us until the latter part of October. 



Fringilla nivalis, Wils. Common Snow Bird. 



This finch makes its appearance here at the first of October, and leaves about 

 the first of May. 



Fringilla melodia. The Song Sparrow. 

 Very numerous and a constant lesident throughout the year. 



Fringilla graminea, Wils. Bay-winged Finch. 



Very numerous all over our cultivated grounds. These birds have a curious 

 habit, during the breeding season, of following persons passing through the 

 fields, all the while uttering a kind of tantalizing, scolding cry, appai-ently with 

 a view of driving off the intruder. 



Fringilla leucophrys, Wils. White-crowned Finch. 

 This species is frequently met with, though not nearly so numerous as many 

 others. 



Fringilla Pennsylvanica, Lath. White-throated Finch. 

 I have seen but a few of this species. 



Fringilla cyanea, Wils. Indigo Blue Bird. 



This ple&sant songster may be heard on the borders of our fields during the 

 whole summer. They are very numerous. 



Fringilla purpobea, Wils. Purple Finch. 



This fincli is seldom seen here in numbers except in extremely severe 

 weather. 




1856.] 293 



Genus EMBERIZA (?) 

 Emberiza nivalis, Aud. White Snow Bunting. 

 I have seen these birds on three or four occasions during severe winters. 



Genus CONURUS, Kuhl. 

 CoNURUS CAROLiNENSis, Linn. The Paroquet. 



This bird was formerly very numerous along White Water river. Several 

 years have elapsed since any of them have been seen. 



Genus PICUS, Linn, 



Pious qderulus, Wils. The Checkered Woodpecker. 

 This Woodpecker is quite numerous and a constant resident. Like the Red- 

 headed Woodpecker, they lay up in the fall a supply of acorns and' beech nuts 

 for winter use. They hull the acorns, split them in two, and firmly drive them 

 edgewise into the cracks of old dry trees. 



Picus BRYTHROCEPHAiiUS. Red-hcadcd Woodpecker. 



This is a numerous and wide spread species. In seasons when oak and beech 

 mast is plenty, they lay up a sufficient quantity to keep them during the winter. 

 But when this supply fails, they uniformly migrate to the south and remain 

 until the weather becomes warm the following spring. 



Picus pileatus, Linn. Called by the people Woodpecker. 

 Once very numerous, but are now rarely seen. 



Picus pubesoens, Linn. Downy Woodpecker. 

 Very abundant and a constant resident. 



Picus villosus, Linn. Hairy Woodpecker. 

 About equal in numbers to the preceding, and very similar in all its habits. 



Picus auratus. Yellow Hammer. 

 This is probably the most numerous with us of all the woodpeckers. 



Picus .The " Sap Sucker." 



This is a shy bird, and but rarely seen. I am inclined to believe it less numer- 

 ous than any other species. Were we to judge of its numbers by the number 

 of holes it bores in the apple-tree, sugar maple, hickory, &c., for the purpose of 

 collecting the sap, we might conclude that it was very numerous. 



Genus COCCYZUS, Vieill. 

 CoccYZus Americanus, Linn. Yellow-billed Cuckoo. 

 We rarely see this bird, yet they are rather numerous. Their uncouth notes 

 may be heard in the recesses of the forest at almost any time during the sum- 

 mer, day or night probably oftener in the night than day. 



Genus ECTOPISTES, Swain. 

 EcTOPiSTES MiGRATORius, Liuu. Wild Pigeon, 

 Still occasionally seen in large numbers, though they have evidently been 

 constantly diminishing in numbers for the last thirty years, and are probably 

 not more than half so numerous as they were thirty years ago. In the month 

 of January and February, 1854, these birds roosted about two miles from this 

 town, (Brookville,) notwithstanding the country is thickly inhabited. No one 

 who did not see them, or who has not seen a " pigeon roost," can form any pro- 

 per conception of their numbers. 



EcTOPiSTES Carolinensis, Linn. Turtle Dove. 



The Turtle Dove is very numerous here, and a permanent resident. The winter 

 of 1855, '56 was so severe that a great many of them perished. 




294 [November, 



Genus MELEAGRIS, Linn. 



Melbagris gallapavo, Linn. The Wild Turkey. 

 Formerly very numerous. They have now become almost extinct in this sec- 

 tion. A very few, however, still linger amongst us. 



Genus ORTYX, Steph. 

 Ortyx Virginianus, Linn. The American Quail. 



Still quite numerous, though gradually diminishing in numbers. Here they 

 are clearly not migratory, but upon the Illinois, Mississippi and Missouri rivers 

 they are said to be so. Late in 'September and in October they seem to have a 

 kind of undefined idea of migrating, and wander around apparently without any 

 fixed object ; but in a short time they become quiet and settle themselves into 

 winter quarters, which they never desert until spring, unless the supply of food 

 fails. They may always be found within a few rods of the same place during 

 the winter if the supply of food is sufficient for their wants. During their " crazy 

 fit " in the fall, they come into the town, and when frightened by the boys will 

 frequently fly against the white houses, often, as I have witnessed, with such 

 force as to kill themselves. I have known the same thing to happen on one oc- 

 casion in the country, when there was but a single white house against which 

 they could fly. They very rarely fly against houses of any other color. 



Genus TETRAO, Linn. 



Tetrad umbellus, Linn. Called here the Pheasant. 

 These beautiful birds were formerly extremely plenty, but have now become 

 rare. 



Genus CHARADRIUS, Linn. 

 Charadrius vociferus, Wils. Killdeer Plover. 

 These curious noisy birds are very numerous about all our streams and wet 

 lands. 



Charadrius helveticus. Plover. 

 Not numerous, though occasionally seen in spring and fall. 



Charadrius marmoratus. 

 Similar in numbers to the former. 



Genus GKUS, Linn. 

 Grus Canadensis, Temm. The Sand-hill Crane. 



I have seen but two or three individuals of this species in this region. In the 

 north western part of the State they are very numerous. In the Kankakee and 

 Calumet swamps, which occupy so large a space in north western Indiana and 

 north eastern Illinois, they build their nests and rear their young. If they were 

 the young of the Grus Americanus, as some here supposed, they would not 

 likely be found breeding here and producing others like themselves, none of 

 which much resemble the latter. They are distinct birds, and vary greatly both 

 in color and size. 



A gentleman who lives upon the Iroquois, in Jasper co., Ind., informed me 

 that he shot a white crane there in 1848, (G. Americana,) which measured 

 nearly seven feet from the point of the bill to the end of the toes, and weighed, 

 he judged, about thirty pounds. 



Genus NUMENIUS. 



Numenius longirostris, Wils. Long-billed Curlew. 



A few of these birds have been seen here. 




1856.] 295 



Genus AEDEA, Linn. 



Ardea herodias, Linn. Great Blue Heron. 

 Quite abundant during the warmer seasons of the year. 



Ardea candidissima. The Snowy Heron. 



Quite numerous some years along White Water, in August, September and Oc- 

 tober. 



Ardea exilis(?). Least Bittern. 



Very numerous along all our streams. Builds its nest in apple-trees and other 

 scrubby trees in the vicinity of rivers. I am not sure that this is not the Green 

 Heron of naturalists (^A. virescens). 



Ardea lentiginosa. The American Bittern. ^ 

 I have seen but three birds of this species in this part of the State. They are 

 quite numerous on the Iroquois and Kankakee in the N. West. The people 

 there call them ''thunder-pumpers;" hence I infer that their love-call is equivalent 

 to the booming of the European Bittern. 



Genus IBIS, Moehr. 

 Ibis loculator. The Wood Ibis. 



The first day of August, 1855, a large flock of these birds made their appear- 

 ance in this neighborhood. They remained along the river and White Water 

 canal for about a month or six weeks. A son of one of my neighbors broke 

 the wing of one of them and caught it. After keeping it three or four weeks, 

 feeding it upon fish, he gave it to me. I kept it until near the first of November, 

 when it fell a victim, as many another biped has done, to its appetite. Some 

 mackerel had been placed to soak upon a table in the back yard, one of which 

 he stole and ate, and upon the evening of the next day died in convulsions. 



It was wonderful to see with what rapidity it could swallow live fish from 

 three to ten inches long, almost as rapidly as a chicken would grains of corn. 



It became so tame whilst I kept it that it would come into the house when 

 hungry. In that short time it learned to know its name (Tantalus), and would 

 come when called, if it happened to be hungry. We learned it to eat raw meat, 

 by putting it into water where it had been fed on fish. 



When not hungry it would remain constantly on a certain spot in the yard, 

 and seemed to have no disposition to leave it, except in search of food. It would 

 stand for hours perfectly still, with its long bill hanging straight down along 

 the neck. When tired of this position it would lay the tarsus flat upon the ground 

 and stand upon the lower end of the tibia. It was perfectly harmless and 

 gentle, and possessed much more good sense and sagacity than its appearance 

 would seem to justify. 



Genus TOTANUS, Bechst. 



ToTANus PLAViPES, Gmel. Little Yellow Shank Tattler. 

 Not very numerous. Occasionally seen along the river. 



ToTANUS MELANOLEUcus, Gmcl. Great Yellow Shank Tattler. 

 Occasionally seen in fall and spring. 



ToTANus SEMiPALMATus, Gmcl. The Willet. 



These birds are rare, though flocks occasionally appear late in the fall and 

 early in the spring. 



Genus TRINGOIDES, Bonap. 



TfiraGOiDES MACULARiA, Liuu. Spottcd Sandpiper. 



Rather numerous along all our streams. 



Tringoides Bartramius, Wils. Upland Plover. 



Very rare. I do not remember ever to have seen but two or three of these 

 birds in this neighborhood. 




296 [November, 



Genus TRINGA, Saj. 

 Teinga Schinzii. Schinz's Sandpiper. 

 Quite a number may be found along our streams. Also, one or two others of 

 the same genus, which I cannot name, for the want of figures and descriptions. 



Genus SCOLOPAX, Linn. 



ScoLOPAX MINOR, Wils. The American Woodcock. 

 Formerly more numerous than at present. A few are still to be found here 

 every year. 



ScoLOPAX WiLSONii. English Snipe, Jack Snipe. 

 Sometimes quite numerous in March and April. 



Genus RALLUS, Linn. 



Rallus Carolinus, Wils. The Carolina Rail. 

 I have seen but four of these birds in this section. They are to be found in 

 September on the Kankakee in large numbers. 



Genus FULICA, Linn. 



FuLiCA Americanus, Gmel. The Coot or Mud-hen. 

 I have occasionally seen considerable numbers of these birds about our streams, 

 who had been compelled to stop by fatigue or stol-ms to rest, before renewing 

 their journey to the South. They are not natives of the soil. 



Genus ANSER, Barrere. 



Anser Canadensis. The Wild Goose. 

 Seen in large flocks every fall and spring in their semi-annual migrations. 

 They rarely ever stop, except they become bewildered during dense fogs. 



Anser bernicla, Aud. The Brent Goose. 



Occasionally seen passing over during their migrations. This and the Wild 

 Goose are the only two species I have ever observed here. 



Genus ANAS, Linn. 

 Anas sponsa, Wils. The Wood Duck. 



Still seen in considerable numbers, though not so numerous as formerly. They 

 breed here occasionally in the hollow trees. 



Anas Americana, Aud. The Widgeon. 

 Occasionally seen in our waters. 



Anas acuta, Wils. The Pintail Duck. 

 Very common in White Water. 



Anas boschas, Linn. The Mallard. 

 The most numerous of all the wild ducks. 



Anas crecca, Wils. The Green winged Teal. 

 Quite common in the spring. 



Anas discors, Wils. The Blue winged Teal. 

 Sometimes very numerous in September and October. 



Anas strepera, Linn. The Gadwall Duck. 

 Have been seen here, but are rare. 



Anas cltpeata, Aud. The Shoveller Duck. 

 Frequently seen in spring. 




1856.] 297 



Anas valisneria, Wils. The Canvas-back Duck. 

 This far-famed duck made its appearance here for the first and only time, so 

 far as my knowledge extends, in March, 1855. One of my friends shot one 

 which I had a chance to examine, and afterwards to taste. It was very tender 

 and juicy, but had such a fishy flavor that it could scarcely be eaten. I sup- 

 posed they had come from the sea coast of the Southern States, where they had 

 fed upon shell fish instead of eel grass, which seems to be necessary to perfect 

 their flavor. 



Anas feeina, Wils. The Pochard or Red-head. 

 This duck made its first appearance, so far as known, about the time or u 

 company with the Canvas-back. One or two of them were killed. 



Anas mabila, Wils. Scaup Duck. 

 Occasionally seen but not numerous. 



Anas rufitorques, Aud. Tufted Duck. 

 About as numerous as the Scaup. 



Anas obscuea, Wils. The Black Duck. 

 Frequently seen in Fall and Winter. 



Fuligula marila, Aud. Lesser Scaup Duck. 

 Was noticed here in 1855. 



Fuligula eubida, Bonap. Ruddy Duck. 

 Occasionally seen in spring. 



Fuligula clangula. Golden-eye Duck. 

 I killed one of these birds in March, 1855, and saw several others. 



Fuligula albeola. Butter Ball Duck. 

 These are probably more numerous in the spring than any other species. 



Genus MERGUS. 



Mergus Mekganser. The Shelldrake. 



These birds are very numerous in White Water during the whole winter, 

 which they visit for the purpose of fishing. The stream is remarkably clear 

 and being very rapid, seldom freezes over, but the water becomes cold enough 

 to benumb the fish, which thus fall an easy prey to these expert divers. I have 

 known one of them to hatch and rear its brood in this vicinity. 



Mergus cucullatus. Hooded Merganser. 



I have seen but a single individual of this species, which was killed in March, 

 1855. 



In addition to the ducks above enumerated, there are some others, but for 

 the want of descriptions and figures I am unable to name them. 



Genus COLYMBUS. 

 Colymbus glacialis. The Loon. 

 The loon is frequently seen in our waters in the fall and spring, being pro- 

 bably compelled by fatigue to stop and recruit their strength. Those which I 

 have seen in the water were great divers, but could not be forced to take wing. 

 The cry or wail of the Loon is, to my ear, the most melancholy sound I have ever 

 heard, conveying the idea of utter hopelessness and despair. 



Colymbus . The Ludapper. 



These birds are rather abundant during October and November. 



Genus PELECANUS. 

 Pelecanus onocrotalus. American White Pelican. 



I have seen a few pelicans flying over ; they are, however, very rare in this 

 section. 




298 [November, 



Genus STERNA. 



Sterna dougallii. The Roseate Tern. 

 I do not recollect to have seen but a single individual of this species. 



Sterna arctica. Black-capped Tern. 



I have seen several flocks of these birds, generally in the month of June, 

 during freshets and storms. 



Genus LARUS. 

 Larus lecooptbrus, Aud. (?) "White-winged Gull. 

 Very common along the river during the winter. Besides this, there are several 

 other species of Gull occasionally seen passing through the country. 



On a new and remarkable genus of Ranidce, from the river Parana. 

 By Edw. Hallowell, M. D, 



Gen. TRIGONOPHRYS. 



Char. Head very large, depressed ; upper eyelid triangular ; tongue large , 

 subcircular, notched in front and posteriorly, more deeply behind, attached in 

 front, free laterally and in its posterior half; upper maxillary teeth large, conical, 

 recurved, sharp-pointed ; two groups of vomerine teeth on a line with the ante- 

 rior margin of the posterior nares, nearer to them than to each other ; posterior 

 nares large, subcircular ; eustachian foramina of moderate size, rather large ; 

 no vocal vesicles either internal or external ; tympanum indistinct ; four fingers 

 completely free ; toes palmate at their base only ; first cuneiform bone present- 

 ing a i^rominence externally, with a well defined projecting edge ; transverse 

 processes of the sacral vertebrce not dilated. 



Trigonophrys rugioeps, nob. 



Char. Body thick and stout, more or less covered with tubercles above ; two 

 movable bucklers beneath the skin, posterior to the occiput ; two glands upon 

 the upper surface of each thigh near the groin ; two others larger upon the 

 breast ; ground color of body and sides olive, presenting numerous dark colored, 

 ovoid spots, with a narrow margin of white, the interspaces in the immature 

 specimens of a beautiful rose color ; extremities olive, with large and broad 

 bands of black margined with white, the interspaces more or less tinged 

 with red ; under parts white mingled with yellow ; chin and throat black spotted. 



Dimensions. Length of head 1 inch 4 lines ; greatest breadth 2 inches 3 J lines ; 

 breadth of bucklers 1 inch "7 J lines ; length of body 3 inches ; breadth 3 inches 

 2 lines; length of anterior extremities 2k inches; of posterior extremities 4 

 inches. 



Gen. Remarks. A more detailed description with drawings, and an account 

 of the anatomy, will be given in the next volume of the Journal. It diifers from 

 Ceratophrys, to which it is closely allied, in the shape of the eyelids, the form 

 of the body, the structure of the skull, and the teeth, which are remarkable for 

 their great development.

 Rand. 



" Notice of remains of extinct Turtles from New Jersey, &c. By 

 Joseph Leidy, M. D. /' referred to a Committee consisting of Dr. Le 

 Conte, Mr. A. H. Smith and Mr. Ashmead. 



Mr. Cassin read a letter from Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu, dated Corrisco, 

 Gaboon, Oct. 15th, 1856, transmitting a large and valuable collection of 

 objects in Natural History, and giving an interesting account of his ex- 

 plorations. On motion of Dr. Le Conte, Mr. Cassin was requested to 

 prepare an abstract of the letter for publication in the Proceedings. 



Mr. Lea mentioned that, in describing a new species of Triquetra, Klein. {Hyria. 

 Lam.) in April last, (Proceedings, vol. viii. p. 79,) he had but a single valve, 

 which had the appearance (as stated in his remarks not yet published) of being 

 twisted like Area tortuosa, Lin. This extraordinary form, which bad never been 

 suspected to exist in any member of the family Naiades, excited great interest 

 with the zoologists who saw it; but it was still a matter of doubt whether the 

 curve, although exceedingly regular and presenting no appearance of constraint 

 or injury, might not be abnormal. This doubt has now, however, been put entirely 

 at rest, for the curve of both specimens is so precisely the same, that when the 

 odd right valve is placed against the left of the other, they fit perfectly, proving 

 that the curve is a mathematical law belonging to the species. He exhibited to 

 the Society a complete adult specimen, which H. Cuming, Esq., of London, sent 

 him for inspeetion and to be figured. The species was recognized by Mr. Cum- 

 ing on his visit here recently at once to be the same as that in his cabinet, and 

 he promptly and liberally offered to place this unique specimen in Mr. Lea's 

 hands for a more perfect description and figure than could be given of the single 

 immature valve he already had. Mr. Cuming's specimen is quite six inches along 

 the dorsal line to the angle of the posterior margin, and this line deflects quite 

 two inches in the course of the six inches from a straight line, and it is so 

 twisted that the basal margin at the posterior end turns up to be on a plane with 

 the dorsal line at the beaks. This remarkable curve causes the long lateral 

 teeth to have a curve of double curvature. The greatest distance from the dor- 

 sal to the basal margin is one inch and three-tenths. The greatest diameter is 

 nine-teuths of an inch, which gives it a sub-cylindrical form, and it is not unlike 

 a twisted banana, (3Iusa sapientum). This perfect specimen presents the superior 

 portion of the valves covered with small, regular tubercles, which was not sus- 

 pected in the original single valve, there being on it only a few irregular undu- 

 late markings. Mr. Cuming's specimen settles the doubt as to habitat. He re- 

 ceived his from Shanghai, and therefore Mr. Fitch and Dr. Tngalls, to whom I 




1856.] 301 



owe the possession of the single valve, were right in assigning it to China. 

 Doubts arose from the fact that, heretofore, Triquetra has been considered to be 

 confined to South America. Mr. Lea stated that he proposed the name should 

 be changed from that he originally proposed, {T. lanceolata, as inappropriate to 

 the complete mature shell,) to that of contorta, which is very descriptive, and can 

 never be mistaken. 



December 23c?.

Remarhs on certain extinct species of Fishes. 



By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



Remarks on Edestus vorax, Journ. A. JV. S. iii. 159. Since describing the fossil, 

 supposed to be the fragment of an upper jaw of a fish, to which the name of 

 Edestus vorax was given, it has occurred to me that it may perhaps be the por- 

 tion of a dorsal spine of a huge cartilaginous fish. In the published Proceed- 

 ings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, (Providence, 




302 [December, 



229,) Prof. Hitchcock has given a notice, together with a wood cut, of a fossil 

 from the coal formation of Indiana, which bears a striking resemblance in form 

 to the fragment of Edestus vorax. The form of the teeth and their relative po- 

 sition to one another and the bone are the same in both fossils. The bone in 

 the wood cut is not represented as being segmented, but if it is so, and the 

 teeth are coosified with the segments, then the specimen actually indicates a 

 second species of Edestus. Prof. Hall informed me, that when he saw the original 

 of the fossil just noticed, that it appeared to him to be an ichthyodorulite. 



From the remarks of Prof. Agasaiz, appended to Prof. Hitchcock's notice, he 

 regards the latter specimen as " a part of the jaw of a shark allied to the saw 

 fish, or Pristis family." Not having seen the original specimen, I am unwilling 

 to consider it as belonging to a member of the peculiar family Edesiina, of which 

 Edestus vorax is the type, but if it does so, it will be widely separated from the 

 Pristis family, in which the teeth are inserted into imperfect sockets, and the 

 jaw exhibits no trace of segmentation. 



Remarks on Cylindr acanthus ornatus, Proc. A. N. S. viii. 12. The fossil frag- 

 ments of long, conical bones, which I supposed to be portions of the dorsal spine 

 of a fish, Prof. Agassiz informs me he considers to be the snout of a peculiar 

 genus of sword fishes, which he has incidentally mentioned in the Poissons 

 Fossiles, (t. V. p. 92,) under the name of Coelorhynclms. The correctness of 

 this view I do not hesitate to admit, and it appears to receive confirmation by 

 the inspection of a figure (plate xi. fig. 26) which I have since observed in 

 Dixon's Geology of Sussex, representing the snout with^its free extremity per- 

 fect. 



Remarks on Saurocephalus and its allies. This is the title of a paper recently 

 presented to the American Philosophical Society. The genus Saurocephalus was 

 founded by Dr. Harlan on a fragment of an upper maxillary bone with teeth, of 

 a peculiar genus of sphyrfenoid fishes, from the cretaceous formation of the 

 Upper Missouri. A second species, under the generic name of Saurodon was 

 subsequently described by Dr. Hays from a specimen consisting of the upper 

 and lower jaws, from the cretaceous formation of New Jersey. Prof. Agassiz 

 afterwards described the remains of several sphyraenoid fishes from the chalk of 

 England, which he has erroneously attributed to the genera Saurocephalus of 

 Harlan and Saurodon of Hays. Dixon, and other authors following Agassiz, 

 have described remains of fishes from the chalk of Europe, and have entirely 

 lost sight of the true Saurocephalus. The various remains attributed to the 

 latter appear to be separable into the following species.

Notices of Remains of Extinct Turtles of New Jersey, collected by Prof. Cook, of the 

 State Geological Survey, under the direction of Dr. W. Kitchell. 



By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



1. Chelone gkand^va, Leidy, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. v. 329. 



Originally founded on three vertebral plates from the Miocene marl of Salem 

 CO., N. J. The collection of the N. J. State Geological Survey contains several 

 costal plates broken into numerous fragments, three anterior marginal plates, 

 and a hyosternal plate also broken into many fragments. A median costal plate 

 restored, measures 8i in. long to the projecting portion of the rib, which is lost, 

 3^ in. wide and J in. thick. The marginal plates, convex above and at the 

 outer border, and acute within, are 4J in. long, 2f wide and 1 in. thick. The 

 broken hyosternal preserves its length, which is 10 in. from the anterior point 

 to the posterior suture. One of the vertebral plates above mentioned, ia 2f 

 in. wide, 2\ in. antero-posteriorly and ^ an inch thick. 



The surfaces of all the bones are smooth. The estimated length of the cara- 

 pace is about 35 to 40 inches, the breadth about 30 inches. 



The same collection contains fragments of several lateral and posterior margi- 

 nal plates of a marine turtle, about the size of that just indicated, but the spe- 

 cimens were obtained from the cretaceous Green Sand formation of Monmouth co. 

 N. J. The specimens have a thick grooved inner border, and gradually become 

 thinner until they terminate in an acute outer border. They are slightly curved 

 upwardly, and their surfaces are smooth. One of the plates has an entire length 

 of 3| inches ; and is 3j inches broad by f of an inch thick at the inner border. 

 Another plate is 4|^ in. long, 2 J in. wide and f of an in, thick internally. 



2. Emts firmcs, Leidy. 



In company with the latter were found the third, sixth and seventh marginal 

 plates of the left side ; the sixth, seventh and eighth of the right side, and 

 portions of the left hyosternal and the right hyposternal plates of a species of 

 Emys. 



The surfaces of the bones are nearly smooth, and those of the sternum are of 

 great thickness. The seventh marginal plate from its upper border to its acute 

 edge measures 3J in., and transversely 2| in. The two eternal plates in the 

 median line are each about 3 in. long, and in the same position are from 7 lines 

 to 1 inch in thickness. 



3. Emys prayus, Leidy. 



Found with the remains of the preceding species, there are the greater portions 

 of a right hyosternal and a left hyposternal plate of a second species. Surfaces 

 without distinct marks of the scutes, and presenting an eroded appearance. 

 Median suture irregular in its course ; and that between the hyo- and the hypos- 

 ternals is even more irregular. Length of each plate in the median suture 5J 

 inches; thickness from 5 lines to half an inch. Breadth of ento-sternal space 2| 

 inches. 



4. Platemys sulcatus, Leidy. 



Specimens of the fifth, sixth and seventh left marginal plates found with the 

 preceding remains of Emys apparently indicate a species of the subgenus Plate- 

 mys. The three bones together measure along their acute margin 8 inches. The 

 seventh plate is 3 inches antero-posteriorly and 2^ high. 



The surface of the plates is marked with tortuous grooves. 



5. Chelone ornata, Leidy. 



The collection of this Academy contains portions of two lateral marginal 

 plates of a marine turtle from the green sand of Burlington co.,N. J., where they 

 were discoved by Mr. L. T. Germain. The bones are wedged-shaped in trans- 




304 [December, 



verse section, grooved at the inner border, acute at the outer border, and mea- 

 sure IJ inches broad. The upper and under surfaces are coarsely but beautifully 

 tuberculated. 



Synopsis of a new Classification of the Vegetable Kingdom. 

 By Theodore C. Hilgaed, M. D. 



"We lay before the public the result of our observations on the natural connec- 

 tions among vegetable forms (relationship), demonstrating them to form a single 

 file of transitions or total resemblances, from the first to the last ; and further- 

 more, showing what can be claimed as absolute relations and what as accidental 

 relation or parallelism ; which parallelisms, if repeated, form laws of rhythmic 

 approximation or collateral relationship ; and under any consideration furn- 

 ishing, we believe, a consistent base for consistent researches on the laws of pro- 

 gressive vegetable development^ and, it may be, organic development generally. At 

 present, occupied with a complete expose and qualification of this scheme, we 

 would be happy beforehand to draw the attention and efforts of botanists, placed 

 mostly under more favorable circumstances than ourselves, to the high import- 

 ance of this question generally, and to thus solicit their own ideas, observations 

 and communications 07i their own grounds^ by which, doubtless, much prolific 

 material might be prepared, elicited and collected. 



In the present scheme, we have noted our principal suggestions of relations 

 hitherto not generally adopted or even known before, by *, by which we mean to 

 imply a very close relationship. If thus a member is introduced among a group 

 of families of acknowledged general afiBnity, it will of course be found enclosed 

 between two stars ; for a mere serialization, according to our views, of families 

 notoriously related, we give no express mark, leaving it to the interest of the 

 reader to compare with their various previous serializations.

HyLA SEMIFASCIATA, nob. 



Char. Of moderate size, larger than lateralis ; snout less acute than in latter 

 species ; head depressed, snout rounded, nostrils small, considerably nearer to 

 the extremity of the snout than the anterior margin of the orbit, a line and three- 

 <juarters apart ; eyes not remarkably prominent ; body elongated, smooth above.

308 [December, 



except towards occiput; head granulated above; abdomen and under part of 

 thighs largely granulated ; tongue obcordate, notched posteriorly, free to some 

 extent posteriorly and upon the sides, attached in front; vomerine teeth in two 

 patches between the posterior nares ; the latter subcircular; fingers webbed at 

 their bases ; toes more largely webbed, the web of the fourth toe extending to 

 the distal extremity of the anti-penultimate phalanx. 



Color. Bluish above, (probably green during life,) green upon the extremities ; 

 the greater part of abdomen and the under part of thighs ochraceous ; chin and 

 throat yellow ; a white band extending above the margin of the upper jaw, 

 passing beneath the eye, and terminating midway upon each side of the body ; 

 a white band commencing midway upon the posterior aspect of the tibia, extend- 

 ing along the outer margin of the tarsus and terminating at the base of the 

 second phalanx of the fifth toe or a little beyond it ; no stripe upon the tibia an- 

 teriorly. 



Dimensions, Length of head 6J- lines ; breadth T ; length from extremity of 

 snout to posterior extremity of body 2 inches 1| lines ; length of arm 5 lines ; of 

 forearm 5 ; of band to extremity of longest finger *l\ ; of thigh 1 inch 2 lines : of 

 tibia 1 inch 1 line ; of tarsus 7 J ; of sole to extremity of longest toe 11 lines. 



Hahitat. Texas. 



Gen. Remarks. This is a larger species than Hyla lateralis, the length of which, 

 according to Daudin, is " un poucc et demi au plus." Dr. Holbrook's specimen, 

 however, measured If inches. The largest specimen in the collection of the 

 Academy measures \k inches, (Fr.) It is a much more slender animal than 

 semifasciata. In lateralis, (viridis, Holb.) the lateral stripe extends as far as 

 the anus, and there is a white band running the whole length of the tibia, both 

 anteriorly and posteriorly. The anterior band is absent in semifasciata. 



3d Fam. BUFONIDyE. 



BuFo NEBCLiFEE, Girard. 



Syn. Bupo granulosus, B. and G. Proceed. A. N. S. vol. vi. p. 173. 



Char. Head triangular, depressed, about as broad as long, with two sharp 

 elevated ridges extending from the extremity of the snout along the inner mar- 

 gin of the eyelids ; this ridge bifurcates about two-thirds of the distance along 

 the inner margin, the external branch terminating in a thick ridge immediately 

 above the tymj)anum, which itself sends off a prolongation anteriorly, passing 

 down between the orbit and the tympanum, and terminating on a level with the 

 inferior margin of the former ; the supra-orbitar ridge sends off also anteriorly 

 a prolongation or branch, which passes down obliquely in front of the orbit, ter- 

 minating in a line with its inferior border, leaving a triangular space upon the 

 side of the head anteriorly ; the internal branch above terminates on a level 

 with the superior margin of the parotid gland about a line from it, and reaches 

 nearly to the posterior margin of the occiput; the extremities of the two are two 

 lines and a half apart posteriorly. These elevated and well defined ridges pro- 

 duce several well marked depressions, or rather concavities, the one long and 

 broad, upon the middle of the upper part of the head, the other two lateral and 

 posterior, and much smaller, the posterior margin formed in part by the anterior 

 margin of the parotids ; nostrils small, just within the anterior extremity of the 

 supra-orbitar ridge ; tympanum rather small, round, very apparent ; no teeth in 

 the upper or lower jaw ; no palatine or vomerine teeth ; internal nares rather 

 large, suboval; a slightly elevated ridge in front; upper jaw notched anteriorly; 

 tongue long, narrow, broader posteriorly, erectile, not notched behind, attached 

 in front, free to some extent laterally ; eustachian foramina triangular in shape, 

 rather smaller than anterior nares apparently ; extremities moderate ; toes 4 5, 

 first and fourth finger longest ; two subpalmar tubercles, with a well marked 

 ridge in the middle ; fourth toe much the longest ; posterior extremities webbed 

 at the base, the web of the fourth toe reaching to the base of the ante-penulti- 

 mate phalanx ; no webs anteriorly ; body moderately robust, thickly covered

809 



(vith warts ; parotids small, covered with pores ; under parts thickly covered 

 all over with granulations. 



Coloration. Brownish black above, with a yellowish dorsal band extending 

 from the occiput to near the anus ; on either side of this a number of jet black 

 blotches, not always very distinct; head olive colored above or fuscous, a black 

 spot in front of each parotid and upon occiput, in the latter situation sometimes 

 coalescing so as to form an irregular band ; the spots in front of the parotids 

 not always pi'esent ; an olive colored irregular broad band upon the sides, com- 

 mencing at the parotids and extending upon the tbighs ; thighs mottled poste- 

 siorly with yellow ; extremities broadly banded with brown, and narrowly with 

 yellow; under parts ochraceous. In a specimen procured from Prof. Agassiz, 

 and deposited in the Academy by Dr. Holbrook, the ground color of the body 

 above is black, the dorsal and lateral bands fuscous, extremities banded with 

 black, under parts fuscous. 



Dimensions of largest specimen. Length 3 inches (Fr.) from extremity of 

 snout to posterior extremity of body; length of head 1 inch 2 lines; greatest 

 breadth 1 inch 2 lines; length of arm 8 lines; of forearm 9 lines; of palm of 

 hand to extremity of longest finger 8 lines ; of thigh 1 inch 1 line ; of tibia 1 

 inch 1 line; of tarsus 8i lines; of sole to extremity of longest toe 1 inch. 



Ilab. Texas. Seven specimens in Museum of Acad. Nat. Sciences. 



Gen. Remarks. This toad is decidedly South American i*i its type, differing 

 entirely in the configuration of the head from any of the North American species. 



It is remarkable, as we have before observed, that the fresh water turtles in 

 Texas and New Mexico appear to be so rare, and we have as yet received none 

 of the Salamandridse from either of these regions, with the exception of an Am- 

 bystoma, viz., A. nebulosum. 



Besides the above we have recently received from Dr. Hammond, of the U. S. 

 Army, stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, a further collection of reptiles, viz., Cro- 

 taphytus collaris, two specimens. One of these has a double interrupted black 

 collar, the body above marked with transverse lines of white spots, the inter- 

 spaces minutely white spotted ; chin and tail marked with bluish ; abdomen, 

 under parts of extremities and tail immaculate ; intermaxillary teeth small, fol- 

 lowed by others larger, conical, the posterior teeth tricuspid ; palatine teeth 

 very remarkably developed ; tongue slightly notched in front and free, emargi- 

 nate posteriorly ; eighteen femoral pores on each side. Three specimens of 

 Phrynosoma Douglassii, one of Cnemidophorus gularis, B. and G., one of Ophi- 

 saurus ventralis, (striatulus, Cuv.,) two of Coryphodon constrictor, (young,) one 

 1 foot 10 lines in length, with the usual markings; one of Elaphis confinis ? 

 (Scotophis confinis, B. and G.,) 1 foot 2 inches 8 lines in length ; 25 rows of 

 scales ; abdom. scut. 233 ; sub. caud. 62; 29 black blotches upon body, 8 upon 

 tail, a smaller intermediate lateral row of black spots on eack side ; abdomen 

 black spotted. (We have recently received the same species from Dennisville, 

 Cape May County, New Jersey, presented by our fellow member S. Ashmead. 

 In this specimen, which is smaller, there are from 25 to 27 rows of scales.) One 

 of Ablabes triangulum, (var. calligaster ;) 25 rows of scales; a triangular spot 

 with its base resting on the frontal ; the apex extending one and a half lines 

 behind the posterior margin of the occipitals, and two long blotches commencing 

 about half a line behind the post-oculars, each about three-fourths of an inch 

 in length ; transverse blotches narrow. One fine specimen of Coronella, similar 

 to the one described in the last number of the Proceedings, but much larger, 

 measuring 1 foot 11 J inches in length, and two inches in circumference. (The 

 red blotches in this specimen are for the most part much wider apart, the black 

 rings approaching each other near and upon the tail ; in one spot near the tail 

 the red has almost totally disappeared.) One Coronella Sayi, (young,) var. see 

 Marcy's Report, pi. vii. One Heterodon nasicus. One Bufo punctatus, (young 

 of Americanus.) Three Ambystoma, (var. luridum,) and two Siredons. These 




310 [December, 



specimens are stouter than those in the collection of the Academy from Santa 

 Fe, New Mexico, (lichenoides, Bd. ?) The ground color is yellowish mingled 

 with oliye, the surface minutely punctated with small black dots ; the 

 surface of head, body and tail covered with innumerable pustulations; these 

 are much less distinct upon the abdomen ; the small lichenoid patches are 

 quite distinct. Notwithstanding the greater narrowness of the head and body 

 in the Santa Fe specimens, and less obtuse muzzle, we are not prepared to con- 

 sider them specifically distinct from those from Kansas (Bridger's Pass, expe- 

 dition in summer of 1856.) The Coronella, Heterodon, Ophisaurus and speci- 

 mens of Ambystoma, are all marked from Bridger's Pass. The others from 

 neighborhood of Fort Riley, Kansas. 



A short time ago we received from Dr. Miles, of the town of Flint, Michigan, 

 a small collection of reptiles, including Tropidonotus ordinatus, parietalis, libe- 

 ris, Herpetodryas vernalis, Storeria occipito-maculata, B. and G., and one Scinck, 

 which appears to be new, and of which the following is a description : 



> Plestiodon vittigerum, nob. 



Char. Color grey above, with three broad lighter colored stripes extending 

 the whole length upon the back, and becoming lost upon the tail ; two narrower 

 ones upon the sides'; a broad black band between the external of the dorsal 

 vittae and the inferior lateral stripe; under parts white. 



Description. The head is of moderate size, slightly swollen at the temples; the 

 rostral plate rounded, heptagonal, broader than long ; two supero-nasals con- 

 tiguous ; a broad internasal; two fronto-nasals ; a frontal pentangular, broader 

 in front, the sides slightly excavated ; two fronto-parietals somewhat larger 

 than the fronto-nasals ; an inter-parietal longer than broad ; two parietals ; nos- 

 tril between two plates ; a naso-frenal ; two frenals, the second larger but not so 

 high as the first; two freno-orbitars ; eight superior labials; five supra-ocular 

 plates ; body moderate ; tail longer than head, neck and body ; 28 rows of broad 

 and smooth hexagonal scales, rounded posteriorly; three or four scales in front 

 of the auricular openings ; third and fourth fingers of nearly equal length, fourth 

 toe the longest. 



Coloration. Head grayish, obscurely spotted and maculated with black ; dorsal 

 vittaj margined with interrupted spots of black ; extremities maculated with 

 black above ; a narrow white stripe upon the thigh posteriorly : under parts 

 white, immaculate. 



Dimensions. Length of head T lines ; breadth 5J ; length of body to vent 2 

 inches 1 line ; of tail 3 inches 10 lines ; of arm 2| lines ; of forearm 3 lines ; of

 to extremity of longest toe 6 lines. 



Habitat. Neighborhood of Flint, Michigan. One specimen in Mus. Acad, pre- 

 sented by Dr. Miles. 



Gen. Remarks. This may possibly be a variety of Plestiodon quinquelineatum ; 

 it differs, however, much from the latter in the coloration, and in the greater 

 breadth of the scales.

MAMMALIA. 



1. Merychippus insignis, Leidy. 



Founded upon a first and second molar of the upper jaw of a remark- 

 .able equine animal, in the structure of the teeth approximating the ruminant 

 family. 



The teeth are inserted by distinct fangs ; and the crowns strikingly resemble 

 the true molars of ruminants. There are four demiconoidal lobes holding the 

 same relationship with one another as in the latter, especially as in the Deer. 

 The outer lobes have almost the exact form as in the true molars of Oreodon. 

 The inner lobes resemble those of ruminants, but are complicated with acces- 

 sory folds as in the horse. No cementum fills up the interspaces of the lobes 

 nor does it appear to have existed as part of the structure of these teeth. 



Antero-posterior diameter of first molar 12 lines ; transverse 8 lines. 

 " " " second molar 10 " " 9 " 



From the tertiary beds of Bijoux Hills on the Upper Missouri. 



2. HiPPARioN (Hippodon) speciosum, Leidy. Pr. A. N. S. VII. 90. 

 Accompanying an inferior molar, there is an unworn upper molar and por- 

 tions of three otlier upper molars, worn away in various degrees, which appear 

 to be the teeth of Ilij^parion, and appear to belong to the same animal as the 

 tooth referred to Hippodon. The inferior molar slightly worn is l\ inches long. 

 10 lines wide, and 4 lines thick. The unworn upper molar is 20 lines long, 11 

 lines antero-posteriorly, and 9 lines transversely. 



Found with the preceding at Bijoux Hills. 



3. Leptarctus primus, Leidy. 



Founded on a single specimen of an upper molar tooth, which bears consider- 

 able resemblance to the fourth superior molar of the Coati. The tooth has a 

 trihedral crown as in the latter and also has three fangs. The inner pair of 

 tubercles of the crown are nearly equal in size; that anteriorly being less well, 

 and that posteriorly better developed than in the Coati. Of the three outer 

 tubercles that anteriorly is more like a talon than a cusp, and the posterior 

 tubercle is better developed in its relation with the median one. I think the 

 specimen represents a genus allied to the Nasua. 



Found with the preceding at Bijoux Hills. 



4. Thespesius occidentalis, Leidy. 



Among the collection of vertebrate remains are two apparent caudal verte- 

 brae and a first phalanx of some huge animal, which I suspect to be a Dinosau- 

 rian, though they maj^ have belonged to a mammalian. The phalanx and one 




,312 [December, 



vertebra were discovered by Dr. Hayden in the lowest member of the Lignite 

 formation of Grand River, Nebraslva. The other vertebra was obtained by Capt. 

 Alfred Sully from an Indian, and is presented to the Academy. The specimen 

 Dr. Hayden supposes to have been derived from the same locality. 



The vertebral bodies very much resemble those of the lumbar vertebra? of the 

 elephant in form and size, Ijut they jjossess articular processes of a very distinct 

 character, and one inch in diameter, for chevron bones. Viewed in front, the 

 bodies are quadrately oval in outline and notched above, one of them being 5 

 inches in diameter, the other 4J inches deep and 4} transversely. Their length 

 is about 2| inches ; their anterior face is convex, and their posterior face is con- 

 cave, with a depth of almost half an inch. The transverse processes, broken 

 away, projected from the conjunction of the vertebral arches and bodies. The 

 spinal foramen, retained entire in the smaller specimen, is circular, and one inch 

 in diameter. 



The first phalanx is 5 inches long, 4^ wide at base and 3J thick in the same 

 position; and 4 inches wide and 2 J thick at the distal end. Deep concavities 

 exist each side of the latter for the lateral ligaments. The proximal articula- 

 tion is a transverse reniform concavity ; the distal articulation a transverse con- 

 vexity, slightly concave towards the middle. 



CHELONIA. 



5. CoMPSEMTS viCTUs, Lcidy. 



Founded on a vertebral plate, the greater portion of the fifth costal plate, 

 and a fragment of the last costal plate, from Long Lake, Nebraska. 



The vertebral plate is an inch broad and nearly the same length. The fifth 

 costal plate is 1^- inches wide, and 2 lines thick, and in its perfect condition 

 appears to have been almost 4 inches long. The fragment of a last costal plate 

 is 3 lines thick. 



The marking of the third or fourth vertebral scutes upon the fifth costal plate 

 indicates them to have been about 2 inches in width. 



The free surface of all the bones is thickly studded with granular tubercles, 

 which give to it a shagreened appearance, difierent from anything observed in 

 recent turtles. 



6. Emys obscurus, Leidy. 



Found with the preceding, were the fivagments of a costal plate, which is 16 

 lines wide, l^ lines thick, and when perfect appears to have been almost 5 inches 

 long. Its free surface is smooth. 



7. Trionyx foveatus? Leidy. Proc. A. N. S., VIII. 73. 



Fragments of a last costal plate, of the right side, 4 lines in thickness, were 

 found with the preceding. 



PISCES. 



8. Mylognathus priscus, Leidy. 



Founded on an upper maxillary bone of a small chimseroid fish, found in com- 

 pany Avith the above mentioned remains of turtles, at Long Lake, Nebraska. 

 The bone forms a narrow triangle which, in its perfect condition, appears to 

 have been only a little over an inch in length, and it is 3j lines wide at the 

 2)OSterior part. Two teeth occupy the whole length and breadth of its surface. 

 Their free surface is convex and porous. The posterior one is almost 8 lines 

 long, and the anterior one about 6 lines.

Catalogue of Birds collected at Cape Lopez, Western Africa, by Mr. P. B. DuChaillu, 

 in 1856, with notes and descriptions of new species. 



By John Cassin. 



During some months passed at Cape Lopez, in which Mr. DuChaillu made the 

 present collection of birds and collections of great interest in other departments, 

 his researches extended to a distance of about sixty miles from the coast. The 

 larger part was, however, collected in the immediate vicinity of Cape Lopez. 



Latterly Mr. DuChaillu has not sent in his collections specimens of common 

 birds previously transmitted. This fact will account for omissions of well- 

 known species in the present catalogue. 



1. Gypohierax angolensis, (Gmelin.) 



Falco angolensis, Gm. Syst. Nat. i. p. 252, (1788.) 



Gray's Genera, i. pi. 4. Jard. & Sel. 111. Orn. N. S. pi. 13. 



Young 5 Entire plumage pale fuscous, very light on the throat and abdo- 

 men, and nearly white on the occiput. Quills and tail brownish black, bill and 

 tarsi greenish yellow. 



This is the only specimen of the young of Gypohierax that has ever come 

 under our notice, though we have frequently seen the adult. In this specimen 

 the pale brown represented in Jard. and Selby 111., as cited above, extends to the 

 entire body and head, the occiput only being nearly white. It has attained the 

 size of maturity. 



2. Lanius Smithii, Fraser. 



Lanius Smithii, Fraser, Proc. Zool. Soc, London, 1843, p. 16. 

 Specimens of both sexes, which are very similar, the females being only 

 slightly lighter in color. 



3. Laniarius Peli, (Bonaparte.) 



Malaconotus Peli, Bonap. Consp. Av. p. 360, (1850.) 

 Laniarius lepidus, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada., vii. p. 327, (1855.) 

 This appears to be a species of frequent occurrence in equatorial Africa. 

 We committed the indiscretion of describing and naming this bird, not being 

 able to recognize it from the short description in Bonaparte's Consp. as above, 

 which is comprised in exactly eleven words. The only use of such descriptions 

 is, that they answer for a sort of caveat to all other naturalists against describing 

 any species at all similar ; and to such extent is this obscure and absurd style 

 persisted in by a few European ornithologists, that there are now about enough 

 irrecognizable descriptions published to cover all possible birds that may be 

 discovered for some time to come. 



For the means of determining this species we are indebted to that accomplished 

 and accurate ornithologist Dr. Hartlaub, of Bremen, whose description is in 

 Cabanis' Journal, 1855, p. 358. 



4. Tepurodornis ocreatds, Strickland. 



Tephrodornis ocreatus, Strickl., Proc. Zool. Soc, London, 1844, p. 102. 



Fraser, Zool. Typ. pi. 36. 



Several specimens, which are almost precisely as figured by Fraser as above, 

 and though all have a general aspect of immaturity, yet are very nearly alike. 

 The females have rather more of the black edgings on the breast and throat, 

 and are slightly smaller. The integral character of the scales of the tarsi holds 




1856.] 317 



good in all these specimens, and is a very curious character, the tarsus having 

 apparently but a single scale in front and another on each side. 



5. MusciPETA PLAViVENTEis, Verrcaux. 



Muscipeta flaviventris, Verr. Cab. Jour., 1855, p. 103. 



One of the most beautiful species of this group and having the under parts 

 of a rich orange color, quite peculiar. The adult male is described by M. Ver- 

 reaux ; the female is smaller and of lighter colors, back and throat approaching 

 bluish cinereous, under parts nearly as in the male. 



6. PliATYSTIRA MELANOPTBRA, (GmeliQ.) 



Muscicapa melanoptera, Gm. Syst. Nat. p. 939, (1788.) 

 Jard. & Sel.m. pi. 9. 



Not to be distinguished from specimens obtained at more northern localities 

 on the coast. 



7. Artomyias fuliginosa, Verreaux. 



Artomyias fuliginosa, Verreaux, Cabanis' Jour., 1855, p. 104, (March.) 

 Butalis infuscatus, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Phila., vii. p. 326, (April, 1855.) 

 The adult is described by M. Verreaux and myself as above. The young is of 

 the same general colors, but with the abdomen, rump and wing coverts thickly 

 spott(?d with white, which predominates in the middle of the abdomen, and 

 marks the tips of the wing coverts. 



This is a most singular form of Iluscicapa, and so nearly approaching the 

 general characters of Hirundo, that although specimens have been in my posses- 

 sion for nearly twenty years, I never felt fully assured that it was not an ob- 

 scure style of Cotyle, until informed by Mr. DuChaillu that it is strictly a Fly- 

 catcher in its habits. It was first sent by Dr. MacDowell from St. Paul's 

 River. 



8. Pratincola salax, Verreaux. 



Pratincola salax, Verreaux, Rev. et Mag. Zool., 1851, p. 307. 



Messrs. Verreaux describe the male of this handsome species. Specimens 

 marked as females in Mr. DuChaillu's collection have the upper parts grayish, 

 with obscure longitudinal stripes of dark brown. Throat gray, breast and flanks 

 dull chestnut, abdomen and rump white. 



9. Macronyx flaviventris, Swainson. 

 Macronyx flaviventris, Sw. B. of W. Af. i. p. 215. 

 Jard. & Selby, III. Orn. N. S. pi. 22. 



In mature plumage and very nearly as described and figured above. Alauda 

 crocea, Vieill. is a very distinct affair and not much like the present bird. 



10. Anthus Gouldii, Fraser. 



Anthus Gouldii, Fras. Proc. Zool. Soc, London, 1843, p. 27. 



Plenty of specimens and all of one species, but not clearly recognizable from 

 Fraser's description. They are, however, obscurely marked, but about the size 

 and general style as described. 



11. Andsopadus latirostris, Strickland. 



Andropadus latirostris, Strickl. Proc. Zool. Soc, 1844, p. 100. 



Numerous specimens. There are not, however, in the present collection any 

 specimens of the allied but quite distinct species A. gracilirostris, Strickl., though 

 both are in collections formerly received from the river Moondah. 



12. Tricophorus calurus, Cassin. 



Tricophorus calurus, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada., viii. p. 158, (1856.) 

 Specimens presenting no characters other than as described. 



13. Tricophorus notatus, Cassin. 



Tricophorus notatus, Cassin, Proc. Acad, Philada., viii. p. 158, (1856.) 

 Precisely similat to specimens originally described by me.

14. Syncopta tincta, Cassin. 

 Syncopta tincta, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada., vii. p. 325, (1855.) 

 In plumage exactly the same as the original specimens. 



10. Sylvietta microura, (Riippel.) 

 Troglodytes micrurus, Eiipp., Neue Wirb. Abyss, pi. 41, fig. 2. 

 Much like the figure as cited and very probably identical. 



16. CiSTicoLA cuRSiTANS, (Franklin.) 



Prinia cursitans, Frank., Proc. Zool. Soc, London, 1831, p. 118. 



"Cisticola oryzicola, Temm., ex Borneo." Label on spec, from Leyden Mu- 

 seum. 



Jard. 111. Ind. Orn. pi. 6. 



Not distinguishable from India specimens, and we may add, scarcely from 

 European Sylvia cisticola. The first that 1 have seen from Africa. 



17. Drymoioa, Swainson. 



Specimens of two species in the present collection I cannot refer to known 

 Western African species of this genus, but must defer naming them until my 

 leisure will allow a full examination of the group. 



18. Spermestes cucullata, Swainson. 

 Spermestes cucullata, Sw. B. of W. Af. i. p. 201, 

 Von Miiller Beitr. Orn. Afr. pi. 16. 



Specimens labelled as adults of both sexes are very similar, but the young 

 are quite different. The entire plumage is dull brown, like the back of the adult, 

 tinged with ashy on the lower parts, and nearly white in the middle of the ab- 

 domen. Not a vestige of the glossy metallic tints of the head, breast and sides 

 of the adult. 



The Baron Von Miiller gives very handsome figures of adults, as above. 



19. Ortygospiza atricollis, (Vieillot.) 



Fringilla atricollis, Vieill. Nouv. Diet. xii. p. 182, (1817.) 



Fringilla polyzona, Temm.? 



Temm. pi. col. 221, fig. 3? 



Specimens in the present collection agree with the description of Vieillot. but 

 though apparently in adult plumage, have no white on the throat nor around the 

 eyes in either sex. I have also before me seven specimens of the true 0. poly- 

 zona from " Gambia," in which this character is present. In other respects the 

 two are very similar. 



Females have the throat pale cinereous, not black as in the male. 



20. ESTRELDA MELPODA, (Vieillot.) 



Fringilla melpoda, Vieill., Ency. Meth. p. 987. 

 Vieill. Ois. Ch. pi. 7. 



Beautiful specimens of both species. The female only differs from the male in 

 being lighter colored. 



21. Fringillaria tahapisi, (Smith.) 



" Emberiza tahapisi. Smith, Rep. of S. Af. Exp." 



Two specimens which are the first appearance of this species in the fauna of 

 Western Africa. Not having access to the description by Dr. Smith, I apply this 

 name on the faith of that accurate ornithologist Mr. Jules Verreaux, who pre- 

 sented specimens from South Africa to the Museum of this Academy. Those 

 specimens are strictly identical with the present, and are labelled by Mr. Ver- 

 reaux " type de Smith." 



22. Sycobius nigerrimus, (Vieillot.) 



Ploceus nigerrimus, Vieill. Ency. Meth. p. 700. 



Ploceus niger, Swains, Cab. Cy. Menag. p. 306. 



Specimens labelled by Mr. DuChaillu as both sexes of this little-known species 

 are entirely black, and differ only slightly in size and lustre of plumage. The 

 young are however very different, having the upper parts dark green with Ion- 




1856.] 319 



gitudinal stripes of brown and black, under parts dull yellow darker on the 

 sides, wings and tail in some specimens brown, in others black. Bill lighter 

 colored than in the adult, under mandible nearly white. In young plumage 

 this bird might readily be mistaken for a distinct species. 



23. Sycobius malimbcs, (Temminck.) 

 Textor malimbus, Temrn. 

 Malimbus cristatus, Vieill. ( 9 ) 



Sycobius rubricoUus, Sw. An. Menag. p. 306. 



Euplectus rufovelatus, Fraser, Proc. Zool. Soc. fiOndon, 1842 p. 42 ? Vieill. 

 Ois. Chant, pi. 43. Fras. Zool. Typ. pi. 46 ? 



I have at this moment specimens before me of all known species of Syco- 

 bius as given by late ornithologists, but am not without diffculty in referring a 

 single specimen in the present collection to either of them. It has a large oc- 

 cipital spot or band of bright scarlet extending somewhat to the sides of the 

 neck. Front and cheeks fully including and above the eyes and all other parts 

 of the plumage fine lustrous black. 



The present specimen is exactly of the size of Viellot's figure cited above, but 

 too small for that of Fraser, though in color resembling the head in the second 

 figure of his plate. I have no doubt that it is the bird represented by Vieillot 

 though perhaps not in adult plumage, but I have doubts of its being Fraser's 

 bird, and also of the supposed identity of the two. A fine specimen of ^S*. rufo- 

 velatus now before me is larger, with the bill straighter and thicker, and very 

 nearly as represented in Fraser's plate. 



In the present bird the front to the eyes is lustrous black. I regard it as 

 S. malimbus in a stage of plumage analogous to that represented by Fraser in 

 the second figure of his plate. 



24. Hyphantornis flavigula, Hartlanb. 

 Hyphantornis flavigula, Hartl. Rev. Zool. 1845, p. 406. 

 Hyphantornis Grayi, Verreaux Rev. etMag. Zool. 1851, p. 514. 



In numerous specimens received from Mr. DuGhaillu, the above are invariably 

 labelled as males and females of the same species. 



25. CoLiosTRUTHDS MACROURUS, (Gmelin.) 



Loxia macroura, Gm. Syst. Nat. i. p. 845, (1788.)

 Buff. PI. Enl. 183, fig. 1. Vieill. Ois. Chant, pi. 41. 



In beautiful plumage. This is the most southern locality that I have ever 

 seen for this species. 



26. CORYTHAIX PERSA, (LinUSBUS.) 



Cuculus persa, Linn. Syst. Nat. i. p. 171, (1766.) 

 Edwards' Birds, pi. 7. 



The species with a crest having red tips. Apparently common in Equatorial 

 Africa. 



27. TocKus FASCIAT0S, (Shaw.) 

 Buceros fasciatus, Shaw. 



Le Vaill. B. of Af. pi. 233. 



Several specimens of the real T. fasciatus, with the second and third feathers 

 of the tail pure white, though the first and those of the middle are black. In 

 the young bird the tips only of the two feathers are white. T. sernifasciatus, 

 Temm. Cabanis' Jour. 1855, p. 35G, is very much like the present bird in young 

 plumage, but a specimen now before me (of T. semifasciatus) from the Rivoli col- 

 lection is considerably larger and has a mature appearance. 



28. TocKus cAMURUS, nobis. 



The smallest known bird of this group. Allied to, and somewhat resembling, 

 T. melanoleucus (Le Vaill. Ois. d'Af. pi. 234). Bill greatly compressed, with a 




320 [December, 



sharp slightly raised culmen, curved. Wing short, fifth and sixth quills longest: 

 tail rather long. 



Total length about 13J inches, wing 6, tail G} inches. 



Bill red. Entire upper parts, throat and breast amber brown, strongly tinged 

 with fulvous on the rump, and with greenish bronze on the wings and tail. 

 "Wing coverts tipped with white, forming two conspicuous bars diagonally cross- 

 ing the wing. Primaries with a single spot of pale fulvous on each web, larger 

 on the inner, tertiaries edged with pale fulvous on both webs. Under parts 

 from the breast white, tinged with cinereous on the sides. Tail amber brown, 

 with a greenish bronzed lustre, tipped with white, shafts of tail feathers above 

 yellowish white inclining to golden ; below white. Legs dark. 



Hab. Cape Lopez, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. DuChaillu. 



This is the smallest bird of the genera Buceros and Tockus that I have ever 

 seen, and appears to be the smallest known species. It resembles in some mea- 

 sure T. mclanoleums as above mentioned, but is much smaller. Three specimens 

 are in the collection, essentially alike. 



29. Halcyon senbgalbnsis, (Linnaeus.) 



Alcedo senegalensis, Linn. Syst. Nat. i. p. 180,(1766.) 



Swains. Zool. 111. pi. 27. 



Not to be distinguished from specimens obtained at more northern localities. 



30. Caprimulgus binotatus, Temminck. 



Caprimulgus binotatus, Temm. Cabanis' Jour. 1855, p. 355. 



The only species of this group that has been received from the Gaboon coun- 

 try. It appears to be this species and is a true Caprimulgus allied to C.pecioralis, 

 Cuvier, C. poUoccphalus, Riippel and others. 



31. Anthreptes Frasbri, Jardine. 



Anthreptes Frazeri, Jard. 111. Orn. n. s. p. pi. 52. 



A single specimen very nearly as described and figured above, but having some 

 appearance of immaturity. 



32. Nectarinia cuprea, (Shaw.) 

 Certbia cuprea, Shaw. 



Cinnyris erythronotus, Sw. B. of W. Af. ii. p. 30, pi. 15. 

 Vieill. Ois. dor. pi. 27. 



Numerous specimens. The female and young are dull yellowish green above, 

 and dull yellow beneath ; totally unlike the male in plumage. 



33. Nectarinia cyanocephala, (Vieill.) 

 Certhia cyanocephala, Vieill. 



Cinnnyris chloronotus, Sw. B.ofW. Af. ii.'p. 136, pi. 16. 

 Vieill. Ois. dor. pi. 7, 25. Jardine Mon. pi. 10. 

 Apparently a common species at Cape Lopez. 



34. Centropus monachus, Riippell. 



Centropus monachus, Riipp. Faun. Abyss, pi. 21. 



A single specimen strictly identical with specimens in the Academy Museum 

 from Mr, Riippell's collection. Larger than C. senegalensis.

The debut of this species in the fauna of Western Africa. One specimen only, 

 which is probably a female, having the under parts dull ashy white. It is quite 

 identical with specimens from Southern Africa in the museum of the Academy.

"Francolinus Peli, Temm." Label on specimen from Leyden Museum. 



Leona Partridge, Lath. Gen. Hist. viii. p. 273. 



Avery handsome species well described by Latham. This bird belongs strictly 

 to the same group as Colurnix histrionica, Hartlaub, and bears a general resem- 

 blance to that species, but is quite distinct. Sexes nearly alike, the female 

 having the white spots of the under parts larger. 



45. Francolinus squamatus, nobis. 



About the size of and belonging to the same group as F. nudkollis and F. Nata- 

 lensis. Bill rather strong, sixth quill longest; tertiaries longer than primaries ; 

 upper tail coverts long ; legs stout ; tarsus in the male with one short, sharp 

 spur. Total length about 14 inches ; wing 7J ; tail 3^ inches. Entire upper 

 parts dark reddish brown, unspotted on the head, variegated with dull reddish 

 white on the back, and with irregular transverse stripes of black on the back, 

 rump and wings. Feathers of the neck edged with ashy white. Entire under 

 parts brownish cinereous with a tinge of fulvous, every feather large and having 

 a dark brown shaft, and conspicuously edged with the same color. Throat 

 paler, breast darker. Upper mandible dark bluish, under mandible red, feet red. 

 Under tail coverts dark reddish brown. Female smaller. 



With a large collection before me, including very nearly all the species of Dr. 

 Smith, I have failed to recognize this bird as a described species. The present 

 specimens are the first that I have ever seen. The large and scale-like character 

 of the plumage of the under parts is quite peculiar. 



46. NUMIDA PLUMIFERA, noblS. 



Of the same subgeneric group (Gutiera) as N. cristata, and bearing a general 

 resemblance to that species. Head above with an ample crest of straight, erect, 

 narrow feathers ; occiput, throat and upper part of neck cov.ered with short 




322 [December, 



downy feathers in the male, naked in the female. Bill rather stout ; rictal mem- 

 brane small ; fourth and fifth quills longest; tertiaries longer than primaries; 

 upper and under tail coverts ample and long ; legs stout. Total length about 

 16J inches ; wing 9 ; tail 5 inches. 



Colors generally resembling those of iV^. cristata^ but without the black of the 

 neck and breast of that species. Crest in both sexes and downy plumage of the 

 head in the male black ; secondary quills with their outer webs yellowish white ; 

 tertiaries with narrow longitudinal stripes of bluish white on their outer and 

 exposed webs. All other parts of the plumage above and below (including the 

 neck and breast) bluish black or slate color, with numerous circular spots of 

 bluish white rather larger on the neck. Bill bluish, lighter at the tip, legs 

 bluish. Female similar to the male, but with the white spots rather larger on 

 the neck; naked skin of the head dark, (naked in the female only.) 



This interesting addition to African Ornithology is strictly of the same group 

 as Numida cristata, Pallas, Spic. Zool. pi. 2, but is readily to be distinguished by 

 its erect crest, which is peculiar, and the absence of the black neck and breast 

 of that species. The white spots on all parts of the body are smaller than in 

 N. cristata, and extend to the neck, breast and tibise, which in that species are 

 black. Specimens of both sexes are in the collection. 



Genus PHASIDUS. 



Allied to Numida, Linn, and to Agelastus, Temm. Bill strong, curved, rather 

 wide and rounded at the tip ; wing moderate ; fifth and sixth primaries longest; 

 tertiaries longer than primaries ; tail moderate ; tarsus stout, with large, some- 

 what rounded or hexagonal scales in front; toes rather long, claws long, stouts 

 Head naked, except a longitudinal stripe on the top of the head. 



47. Phasidus nigbk, nobis. 



Head and throat naked, but with a longitudinal stripe of short black feathers 

 from the base of the bill to the occiput, ending abruptly'. Neck before and throat 

 with a few short black feathers, behind and below the bare space densely 

 covered with short black feathers. 



Entire plumage black, very obscurely punctated and vermiculated, with a 

 lighter shade on the upper parts and lighter on the middle of the abdomen. 

 Bill corneous, with the edges of the mandibles nearly white; legs and toes dark 

 corneous. Naked space on the head probably yellow or light red. Male. 



Total length about 17 inches ; wing 8 ; tail G inches. 



This is the most remarkable bird yet discovered by Mr. DuChaillu, It belongs 

 to the same group as Numida and Agelastus, but is more intimately allied to the 

 latter, of which the only known form is Agelastus meleagrides, Temm. Cabanis' 

 Jour. 1855, p. 356, and for a fine specimen of which this Academy is indebted 

 to the liberality of the distinguished naturalist by whom it was first introduced 

 to the notice of ornithologists. 



A single specimen, labelled as a male, is in the collection, and is from a few 

 miles in the interior, ^t Cape Lopez. The general appearance of this bird is not 

 unlike that of Gallophasis purpureus, Gray, but is generically distinct. 



48. HiATicuLA PEC0ARIA, (Tcmmiuck.) 

 Charadrius pecuarius, Temm. PI. Col. v. pi. 183. 



Identical with South African specimens in the Academy's Museum. 



49. Nycticorax europ^us, Stephens. 



Nycticorax europasus, Steph. Gould B. of Eur. pi. 279. 



A single specimen in very mature plumage. Rather lighter in color than 

 specimens from Europe, and with the white of the front extending over and 

 behind the eye. 



The Committee on Proceedings presented a Special Report, which 

 was adopted.

The following Report of the Librarian was read and adopted . 

 LIBRARIAN'S REPORT FOR 1856. 



The additions to the Library of the Academy during the current year amount 

 to 1,449, of which number 295 are complete volumes, and 1,154 are pamphlets, 

 scientific periodicals, &c. The sources whence these books hare been obtained, 

 and the general subjects upon which they treat, are presented in the following 

 table : 



By referring to the last Report of the late Librarian, Dr. W. S. Zantzinger, it 

 will be seen that the total increase for the present year exceeds that for 1855 

 by 592. In December last, Dr. Z. estimated that the Library contained about 

 15,500 volumes, tracts, periodicals, serials, &c. By the additions for 1856, this 

 number has been swelled to 16,949. 



Respectfully submitted by 



J. AiTKEN Meigs, Librarian. 

 Dec. 30th, 1856. 



The Curators presented their Annual Report which was read, adopted 

 and referred to the Committee on Proceedings. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS FOR 1856. 



The Curators take pleasure in reporting that the Museum of the Academy is 

 in an excellent condition of preservation, and that it has received valuable ac- 

 cessions to all its departments during the year just about closing. 



Since the last annual report was presented to the Academy, the arrangement 

 of the Ichthyological collection has been undertaken by Drs. R. E. Bridges and 

 J. Cheston Morris ; and W. J. Binney, Esq. has commenced the arrangement of 

 the Cenchological collection. The collection of Birds continues to be arranged 

 by Dr. T. B. Wilson. The collections of Minerals, Crustacea, Insects, and Fos- 

 sil plants have been arranged prior to this year as stated in previous reports. 

 No department is perhaps better arranged than that of the Herpetological col- 

 lection, for which the Academy is indebted to the information and zeal of Dr. 

 E. Hallowell The collection of Vertebrate Remains has been recentlj'' arranged 

 by Dr. J. Leidy. Mr. E. Durand has made considerable progress in the forma- 

 tion of an American Herbarium, which he informs us will be of a very complete 

 character. In several departments, the Academy yet needs some assistance be- 

 fore the Museum shall be completely arranged, more especially in the depart- 

 ments of Mammalogy, Invertebrate Palaeontology, and Geology. 



During the year 1856, the donations to the different departments of the Mu- 

 seum have been as follows : 



Mammals. Of these 33 specimens of 14 species have been added to the collec- 

 tion ; and among them is a fine specimen of the Musk Ox, deposited by Dr. E. 

 K. Kane, and one of the Walrus, presented by Sandwith Drinker, Esq. 




326 [December, 



Birds. W. S. Wilson, Esq. presented 146 specimens of 129 species of Birds ;

EXPLANATORY NOTE. 



Siace the death of the late lamented President of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences, Dr. Samuel George Morton, his magnificent Col- 

 lection of Human Crania, recently increased by the receipt of 67 skulls 

 from various sources, has been permanently deposited in the Museum of 

 the Academy. Prior to his demise. Dr. M. had received 100 crania in 

 addition to those mentioned in the third edition of his Catalogue. Since 

 1849, therefore, the Collection has been augmented by the addition of 167 

 skulls. To complete the Catalogue in a uniform manner, these have been 

 carefully numbered and measured in accordance with the methods re- 

 corded in the Crania Americana, &c. In a portion of these measurements 

 I was kindly assisted by our fellow-member, Dr. Thos. J. Turner of the 

 United States Navy. 



The entire Collection, numbering 1035 crania, was purchased by 

 forty-two gentlemen* from the executors of Dr. Morton, for the sum of 

 $4,000, and by them generously presented to the Academy. 



The Collection occupies 16 cases on the first gallery, on the south side 

 of the lower room of the Museum. For convenience of study and exam- 

 ination I have grouped the crania according to Eace, Family, Tribe, &c., 

 strictly adhering, however, to the classification of Dr. Morton. It will 

 be seen, also, that the same arrangement has been adopted in this edition 

 of the Catalogue, so that it is an exact representation of the Collection as 

 it stands upon the shelves. While the old numbering has been carefully 

 preserved for the sake of reference to the various published descriptions 

 of Dr. Morton, new numbers have been added to designate the position 

 of any skull in the natural division or subdivision to which it belongs. 



The Suevic, Cimbric and Scandinavian divisions of the great Teutonic 

 Race, are represented by 32 crania and 3 casts, distributed as follows : 



*Their names are as follows: Charles Henry Fisher, Thomas Biddle, Henry J, 

 Williams, Charles D. Meigs, Thomas T. Lea, John Farnum, John A. Brown, William 

 Welsh, Richard Price, Morris L. Hallowell, Joseph D. Brown, William Piatt, Joseph

4 INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 



1 Norwegian, 7 Swedish peasants, 2 Swedes from Finland, 3 Swedes from 

 Sudermanland, 1 Ostrogoth, 1 Turannic Swede, 2 Cimbric Swedes, i 

 Cimbrian from Moen Island, 11 Germans, 1 Dutchman, 4 Prussians, and 

 1 Ancient Burgundian. Among these I have also placed 3 Swedish-Finns, 

 which, though mixed, are more Swedish than Finnish. Next to these 

 from their affinity, have been arranged the heads of 9 true Finns and a 

 cast of a Finlander's skull. 



Of 4 Swedish peasants, the highest internal capacity is 99, the 

 lowest 65, while the average of the group is 83 cubic inches. Of 2 Swedes 

 from Finland, the larger is 107.5, the smaller 93.75, and the mean 100.62. 

 Of 3 Swedes from Sudermanland, the highest measurement gives 108.25, 

 the lowest 102, and the mean 101.41 inches. Of two Cimbric Swedes, the 

 higher is 94, the lower 80, the mean 87. Of 10 GTerman heads, the highest 

 is 104, the lowest 70, and the mean of the series 88.6. The skull of a 

 Dutch gentleman (No. 434) is the largest in the entire collection, for it 

 measures 114 cubic inches of internal capacity. Four Prussian skulls 

 give 92 for the highest, 80 for the lowest, and 83.5 for the mean. The 

 average for this branch of the Teutonic Family, as deduced from the 

 foregoing measurements is about 94 cubic inches. 



Of 3 Swedish Finns, the highest internal capacity is 89, the lowest 85, 

 and the mean 87 inches. Of 9 true Finns, the highest is 112.5, the lowest 

 81.5, the mean 94.3. A large portion of this valuable series from Nos. 

 1545 to 1550, and from 1542 to 1541, were received from Prof. Eetzius, 

 after the death of Dr. Morton. 



Many of the above Crania " have been obtained from hospitals and 

 institutions for paupers, whence we may infer that they pertain to the 

 least cultivated portion of their race."* The brief histories attached to 

 Nos. 1539, 1540, 1542 and 1546, were written in the Danish language, on 

 slips of paper, which had been placed in the cavity of each cranium. Of 

 these I obtained translations through the kindness of Dr. L. Elsberg. 



The Anglo-Saxon race differs from the Teutonic in having a less 

 spheroidal and more decidedly oval cranium. 



" I have not hitherto exerted myself to obtain crania of the Anglo- 

 Saxon race, except in the instance of individuals who have been signalized 

 by their crimes ; and this number is too small to be of any importance in 

 a generalization like the present. Yet, since these skulls have been 

 procured without any reference to their size, it is remarkable that five 

 give an average of 96 cubic inches for the bulk of the brain ; the smallest 

 head measuring 91, and the largest 105 cubic inches. It is necessary to 

 observe, however, that these are all male crania ; but on the other hand> 

 they pertained to the lowest class of society, and three of them died on 

 the gallows for the crime of murder." 



*This and the following quotations are taken from the unfinished memoir left by Br. 

 Morton. The MS was kindly loaned to me by his son, Mr. Robert P Morion. 




INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 5 



'The Anglo-Americans, the lineal descendants of the Anglo-Saxons, 

 conform in all their characteristics to the parent-stock. They possess, in 

 common with their English ancestors, and in consequence of their amal- 

 gamation, a more elongated head* than the unmixed Germans. The few 

 crania in my possession have, without exception, been derived from the 

 lowest and least cultivated portion of the community malefactors, paupers 

 and lunatics. The largest brain has been 97 cubic inches ; the smallest, 

 82 ; and the mean of 90 (nearly) accords with that of the collective 

 Teutonic race. The sexes of these 7 skulls are 4 male and 3 female." 



" The Celts who, with the cognate Gauls, at one period, extended 

 their tribes from Asia Minor to the British Islands, are now chiefly con- 

 fined as an unmixed people to the west and south-west of Ireland, whence 

 have been derived the 6 crania embraced in the Catalogue. These range 

 between 97 as a maximum and 77 as a minimum of the size of the brain ; 

 and the mean, which is 87 cubic inches, will probably prove to be above 

 that of the entire race and not exceed 85." 



In the following table, the reader will find some of the European races 

 compared together in relation to their cranial capacities. 



TABLE L 



European Crania. 



In the above table, the reader will observe the high cranial capacities 

 of the Swedes, Finns, and Germans; he will also perceive that the Anglo- 



* "This peculiarity must continue to develop itself still more obviously in the United 

 States, in consequence of the immense influx of a pure Celtic population from the south 

 and west of Ireland ; for this population by intermarriage with families of English and 

 German descent, while it rapidly loses its own national physiognomy, will leave its traces 

 in a part at least of the Anglo-Saxon race by whom it is every where surrounded." 




b INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 



SaxoDS and Anglo-Americans possess the same large average ; while tho 

 mean for the Kelts and Cimbri is several inches less. It is a curious fact, 

 that in the column marked " Kelts," Nos. 21, 42, 52, and 985 exhibit the 

 Gothic type, and have generally the high internal capacity of the Northern 

 races; while Nos. 18, 1186, and 1564, which are of the Cimbric type, 

 possess a lower internal capacity. The Table is not extensive enough to 

 base upon this interesting fact any positive conclusion ; but as far as this 

 fact goes, it appears to indicate that the Cimbric and Keltic types of 

 skull are closely allied, if not indeed identical. 



" I much regret that my cranial series possesses but a single example 

 derived from the Sclavonic race, the skull of a woman of Olmutz, sent me 

 by Prof. Retzius, and which measures only inches.* I record this de- 

 ficiency in my collection, in the hope that some person interested in pur- 

 suits of this nature may be induced to provide me with materials for 

 making the requisite comparisons. My impression is that the Sclavonic 

 brain will prove much less voluminous than that of the Teutonic race." 



"I do not use the term Pelasgic with ethnological precision, but in this 

 designation place the Greeks and Romans, and their descendants in 

 various parts of Europe, Greece and Italy, and in more isolated ex- 

 amples, in Spain, France and Britain. In the same category I place the 

 Persians, Armenians, Circassians, Georgians and many other kindred 

 tribes, together with the Grajco-Egyptians. 



" Of 4 adult Circassian crania, brought me by Mr. Gliddon, two are 

 male and two female. The former, which we may suppose, from appear- 

 ances, to have been associated with a full share of manly beauty, measure 

 90 and 94 cubic inches of internal capacity; the female heads measure 79 

 and 80 ; whence we obtain 86 cubic inches as the mean of all. One of 

 these skulls, that of a woman who had passed the prime of life, is remark- 

 able for the harmony of its proportions, and especially for the admirable 

 conformation of the nasal bones. 



" Of 4 adult Armenian skulls, 3 pertain to men ; and the average size 

 of the brain is but 83 cubic inches. I have felt some hesitancy in admit- 

 ting these skulls in this place, for two reasons : 1st, because their charac- 

 teristics incline almost as much to the Arab type as to the Pelasgic ; and. 

 2dly, because the term Armenian is not always used in a strictly national 

 sense in the East, but is applied to a class of merchants whose ethnologi- 

 cal affinities must be often very mixed and uncertain. 



" I possess, through the kindness of Mr. Gliddon, two female Parsee 

 skulls, which, though small, present a beautiful form. One measures 89 

 cubic inches, the other only 75." 



Of 23 Grajco-Egyptian heads, the highest internal measurement is 97 

 cubic inches, the lowest 73, and the mean 86.11, which is about "7 cubic 

 inches above that of the pure Egyptian race, and but three inches less 

 than the average I have assumed for the Teutonic nations. * * * * 



* I find upon examination, that this head, in its present condition, is incapable of 

 naeaeuremeni, in consequence of the presence ofthe falx cerebri and tentorium. 




INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 7 



Some of these present the most beautiful Caucasian proportions, while 

 others merge by degrees into the Egyptian type ; and I am free to admit 

 that in various instances I have been at a loss in my attempts to classify 

 these two great divisions of the Nilotic series." 



The Semitic race " includes the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Syrians, and 

 Lydians of antiquity, together with the Arabians and Hebrews." 



"Five of my embalmed Semitic heads are susceptible of measurement; 

 and give the low average of 82 cubic inches the largest measuring 88 ; 

 the smallest 69.* In these crania, and also in others of existing Semitic 

 tribes, I have looked in vain for the pit described by Mulder as situated 

 on the outer wall of the orbit at the attachment of the temporal muscles ; 

 and consequently there is no trace of the corresponding elevation, also 

 described by him, within the orbitar cavity. 



"I have had but little success in procuring the crania of the modern 

 Semitic tribes; and for the 3 that I possess, I am indebted to Mr. Glid- 

 don. Of these, two are Baramka, or Barmecide Arabs; the third a Be- 

 douin. The largest measures 98 cubic inches; the smallest 84; and the 

 mean is 89 ; but if we take the average of these 8 Semitic heads, ancient 

 and modern, it will be 85 inches." 



The Nilotic race comprises the ancient Egyptians of the pure stock, 

 and the modern Fellahs. Most of the Egyptian skulls were presented by 

 Messrs. G. R. and W. A. Gliddon, A. C. Harris, of Alexandria, in Egypt. 

 and Dr. Chas. Pickering. Of the 88 crania which present the Egyptian 

 conformation, 55 are capable of measurement. At least eleven of these 

 heads " are of the unmixed type, and present the long, oval form, with a 

 slightly receding forehead, straight or gently aquiline nose, and a some- 

 what retracted chin. The whole cranial structure is thin, delicate, and 

 symmetrical, and remarkable for its small size. The face is narrow, and 

 projects more than in the European, whence the facial angle is two de- 

 grees less, or 78. Neither in these skulls, nor in any others of the Egyp- 

 tian series, can I detect those peculiarities of structure pointed out by 

 the venerable Blumenbach in his Decades Craniorum ; and the external 

 meatus of the ear, whatever may have been the form or size of the carti- 

 laginous portion, is precisely where we find it in all the other races of 

 men. The hair, whenever any of it remains, is long, curling, and of the 

 finest texture." 



"On comparing these crania witli<ftnany/ac similes of monumental effi- 

 gies, most kindly sent me by Prof. Lepsius and M. Prisse d'Avesnes, 1 

 am compelled, by a mass of irresistible evidence, to modify the opinion 

 expressed in the Crania ^gyptiaca viz : that the Egyptians were an 

 Asiatic people. Seven years of additional investigation, together with 

 greatly increased materials, have convinced me that they were neither 

 Asiatics nor Europeans, but aboriginal and indigenous inhabitants of the 

 Valley of the Nile, or some contiguous regions ;t peculiar ia their phy-

siognomy, isolated in their institutions, and forming one of the primordial 

 centres of the human family," 



Of the 55 measured Egyptian heads, the largest measures but 96 cubic 

 inches; the smallest 68; while the mean of all is about 80. The crania 

 from the ancient tombs of Gizeh give an average of about 84 inches. 

 Concerning these Dr. Morton says: "The persons whose bodies had re- 

 posed in these splendid mausolea were, no doubt, of the highest and most 

 cultivated class of Egyptian citizens ; and this fact deserves to be con- 

 sidered in connection with the present inquiry. To this we may add that 

 the most deficient part of the Egyptian skull is the coronal region, which 

 is extremely low, while the posterior chamber is remarkably full and pro- 

 minent." 



Of 19 Fellah skulls, the highest measurement is 96 cubic inches; the 

 lowest 66; and the mean of all about 79. Nos. 771, 772, and 773 were 

 sent by Mr. Gliddon as Jewish crania, but Dr. Morton, guided by their 

 form, has classified them, perhaps erroneously, with the Fellahs. Mr. 

 Gliddon, in a note in "Types of Mankind" (p. 723, No. 390) says : "They 

 came from the old Jewish burial-ground, behind Muss'r-el-Ateeka, on the 

 desert, toward Bussateen ; and no Muslim is interred near a Jew." 



From the form of the skull, the mental and moral character of the peo- 

 ple, and their existing institutions, such as phallic worship. Dr. Morton 

 considers these Fellahs or Arab-Egyptians of the present day to be the 

 lineal descendants of the ancient rural or agricultural Egyptians blended 

 with the intrusive Arabian stock. 



"The skull of the Fellah is strikingly like that of the ancient Egyptian. 

 It is long, narrow, somewhat flattened on the sides, and very prominent 

 in the occiput. The coronal region is low, the forehead moderately re- 

 ceding, the nasal bones long and nearly straight, the cheek-bones small, 

 the maxillary region slightly prognathous, and the whole cranial struc- 

 ture thin and delicate. But notwithstanding these resemblances between 

 the Fellah and Egyptian skulls, the latter possess what may be called an 

 osteological expression, peculiar to themselves, and not seen in the Fel- 

 lah." 



" Of 35 adult Indostanic skulls in the collection, 8 only can be identified 

 with tribes of the Ayra* or conquering race ; nor even in this small num- 

 ber is there unequivocal proof of the affinity in question. The largest 

 head in the series, that of a Brahmin, who was executed in Calcutta for 

 murder, measures 91 cubic inches for the size of the brain the smallest 

 head 79. Two others pertain to Thuggs, remarkable for an elongated form 

 and lateral flatness. The mean of these Ayra heads is 86 cubic inches." 



* A fair race, with Sanscrit speech, whose primal seats were in Eastern Persia. They now 

 occupy the country between the Himalaya Mountains on the North, the Vindya on the 

 South, and between the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal a region known as Ayra. 

 varta, or India Proper. 




INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 9 ' 



" Contrasted with this people, and occupying the country adjacent to 

 the Bay of Bengal, are the Bengalees small of stature, feeble in consti- 

 tution, and timid in disposition. They are obviously an aboriginal race, up- 

 on whom a foreign language has been imposed ; and are far inferior, both 

 mentally and physically, to the true Ayras. Weak and servile themselves, 

 they are surrounded by warrior castes ; and perhaps the most remarkable 

 feature of their character is the absence of will, and implicit obedience to 

 those who govern them." 



Of these child-like people, the Collection embraces 26 adult crania, of 

 which the largest measures 90 cubic inches ; the smallest 67 ; and the mean 

 of all is 78. 



The Mongolian group has received several additions since the death of 

 Dr. Morton. It is at present represented by 17 crania and 4 casts, distri- 

 buted as follows : 11 Chinese, 1 Japanese, 1 Burat-Mongol, 1 Kamschat- 

 kan, 1 Kalmuck, 5 Laplanders, and 6 Eskimos. 



Of ten Chinese crania, the largest measures 98 cubic inches ; the small- 

 est 70 ; while the mean is about 85. Through the kindness of Mr. Cramer, 

 of St. Petersburgh, a well marked Kalmuck skull has been added to the Col- 

 lection. It measures 93.75 cubic inches of internal capacity. Two true Lap- 

 lander's skulls measure respectively 94 and 102 inches ; while a hybrid Lap- 

 land skull gives 78.75. Of the 4 Eskimo crania, presented by the late Dr. E. 

 K. Kane, the largest internal capacity is 98; the smallest 80.5; givingamean 

 for all of 85.94. During his stay in this city, Mr. Combe, the Phrenologist, 

 loaned to Dr. Morton three Eskimo skulls, which were brought from the 

 Polar regions by Capt. Parry. The average measurement of these was 

 86.83 inches.* The mean size of the brain of this remarkable and inter- 

 esting Hyperborean people, (as deduced from this series of 7 skulls,) is 

 therefore about 86.32 inches. 



The Malay group comprises 26 crania of Malays proper, and 12 Poly- 

 nesians. The largest Malay skull measures " 97 cubic inches ; the smallest 

 68 ; and they give a mean of 86 ; a large brain for a roving and unculti- 

 vated people, who possess, however, the elements of civilization and re- 

 finement." The largest portion of this series has been collected with eth- 

 nological precision, "and so much resemble each other as to remind us of 

 the remark of Mr. Crawfurd that the true Malays are alike among them- 

 selves, but unlike all other nations. * * * * They have a rounded cranium, 

 with a remarkable vertical diameter and ponderous structure. The face is 

 flat, the cheekbones square and prominent, the ossa nasi long and more 

 or less flattened, and the whole maxillary structure strong and salient." 



The Polynesian family is represented by 7 Kanaka, 1 New Zealand and 1 

 Marquesan skulls. The Kanaka crania give a mean of 83 cubic inches of 

 internal capacity. 



The great American group is, in several respects, well represented in 

 the Collection. It includes490 crania, and 13 casts, making a total of 503 



* Crania Americana, p. 247.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 



from nearly 70 different nations and tribes. Of this large number 256 be- 

 long to the Toltecan Race,* and 247 to the Barbarous Tribes scattered 

 over the continent. It will thus be seen that they are nearly equally di- 

 vided between the two primary divisions of this group. 



Of 164 measurements of crania of the Barbarous Tribes, the largest in 

 104 cubic inches ; the smallest 69 ; and the mean of all 84. One hundred 

 and fifty-two Peruvian skulls give 101 cubic inches for the largest internal 

 capacity, 58 for the smallest, and 75.3 as the average of all. Of 25 skulls 

 of the Mexican Family, the largest measures 92; the smallest 67 ; while the 

 mean is 81.7 inches. The number of cranial measurements and the means 

 of these measurements for the different tribes, &c., of the two American Fam- 

 ilies, are given below in a tabular form.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE. - 11 



The Negro Group embraces117 skulls and 2 casts, divided as follows : 

 16 American-born negroes, 88 native Africans, 2 Hovahs of Madagascar, 

 11 Australians, and 2 Oceanic Negroes. Of the American-born Negroes, 

 the largest measurement is 86 ; the smallest 73 ; while the mean is 80.8. 

 The largest of the native African series is 99 ; the smallest 65 ; and the 

 mean of 64 measurements is 83.7. For the Hottentot family, 3 skulls 

 give a mean of 75.3 cubic inches ; two Hovah skulls of Madagascar average 

 82.5 ; and lastly the Alforian family gives for 8 Australian crania 75, and 

 for two skulls of Oceanic Negroes 76.5 cubic inches. 



Under the head of Mixed Races have been placed 5 Coptic (3 ancient 

 and 2 modern), 12 Negroid Egyptian, 4 Nubian, 2 Hispano-Peruvian, 3 

 Negroid Indian, 1 Hispano-Indian, 1 Malayo-Chinese, and 2 Mulatto 

 crania. 



"Almost every investigation into the lineage of the Copts results in 

 considering them a mixed progeny of ancient Egyptians, Berabera, Ne- 

 groes, Arabs, and Europeans ; and these characteristics are so variously 

 blended as to make the Copts one of the most motley and paradoxical 

 communities in the world. The Negro traits are visible, in greater or 

 less degree, in a large proportion of this people, and are distinctly seen 

 in the three skulls in my possession." 



Eighteen crania of lunatics and idiots, seven illustrative of growth, 

 two phrenologically marked, and eleven of uncertain origin, complete 

 the Collection. 



Extensive and unique as is this Collection, it is, nevertheless, still too 

 limited to justify any positive and comprehensive conclusions concerning 

 the great fundamental problems of Ethnology. That it will be capable, 

 when sufficiently extended, of throwing much light upon these obscure 

 and unsettled questions is amply attested by the scientific publications of 

 Dr. Morton. It is earnestly hoped, therefore, that this magnificent nu- 

 cleus, the result of much pecuniary sacrifice and many years of enthusias- 

 tic labor on the part of its late illustrious owner and founder, will not be 

 neglected, but that its efficiency will be increased, and the objects for 

 which it was gathered together attained by contributions from all who 

 may be interested in the advancement of this youngest, most intricate, 

 and most important of the sciences. 



The Norwegians and Danes of the Scandinavian race, the Bas-Bretons, 

 the Celtic Scotch, Welsh, Spanish, and Portuguese, the ancient and mo- 

 dern Greeks, the Magyar people, the great Tartar and Scythic hordes, 

 the entire Basque family, and many other races, are without a single re- 

 presentative in the Collection. Of the Polar and Tchudic Families it 

 contains but 4 and 9 skulls respectively; while the ancient Romans and 

 their descendants, the modern Trasteverini beyond the Tiber, the great 

 Sclavic race, and the Berber tribes, are each represented by but one 

 skull. 

 These deficiencies and many others could easily be particularized

are recorded in the hope that the attention of the scientific community 

 being' directed to them, they will sooner or later be supplied.

NOTE. 



From my paper on the Cranial Characteristics of the Races of Men 

 contribvited to the forth-coming work of Messrs. Nott and Gliddon, entitled 

 ' Indigenous Eaces of the Earth," I have selected and embodied in the 

 Catalogue several brief paragraphs descriptive of some of the heads in the 

 Collection. These paragraphs are enclosed in brackets, thus, [ ]. 



For the use of the wood-cuts which embellish the succeeding pages, 

 and which were originally executed for Crania Americana, Crania iEgyp- 

 tiaca, Types of Mankind, and Indigenous Eaces of the Earth, I am in- 

 debted to the kindness of Messrs. G. E. Gliddon and R. P, Morton.

I commenced the study of Ethnology in 1830 ; in which year, having 

 occasion to deliver an introductory lecture on Anatomy, it occurred to 

 me to illustrate the difference in the form of the skull as seen in the five 

 great races of men. After the lapse of but twenty years, the fact seems 

 strange even to myself, that when I sought the materials for my proposed 

 lecture, I found to my surprise that they could be neither bought nor 

 borrowed. Caucasian and Negro crania were readily procured, and two 

 or three Indian skulls were placed at my disposal; but for the Mongolian 

 and Malay I inquired in vain. I resolved, therefore, to supply this re- 

 markable deficiency in an important branch of science; and much time? 

 toil, and expense have been rewarded by the acquisition of 867t human 

 skulls and 601 of the inferior animals. Yet I need hardly add, that had 

 it not been for the exertions of my friends in every quarter of the globe 

 my object would have remained unaccomplished. The following pages 

 afford emphatic evidence on this point; and it gives me great pleasure 

 thus to record the kindness of those persons who have aided me in an 

 enterprise that, for obvious reasons, has been attended by many diffi- 

 culties. 



The primary motive in making the following Collection, has been to 

 compare the characters of the cranium in the different races of men, and 

 these again with the skulls of the inferior animals ; not only in reference 

 to exterior form, but also to internal capacity as indicative of the size of 

 the brain. 



Beside these strictly Ethnographic objects, some others of a different^ 

 and subordinate kind have been had in view; such as pathological condi- 

 tions of the skull from diseases and from wounds ; remarkable develop- 

 ments illustrative of the principles of Phrenology, and preternatural 

 growths of every description. 



The Indian crania contained in this series have received my especial 

 attention, both in respect to their number and authenticity, for they have 

 been collected with great care by the gentlemen whose names are asso- 

 ciated with them. In every instance where a doubt is entertained as to 

 the tribe or nation to which the skull belonged, it is expressed by a mark 

 of interrogation; and where no clue exists for such information, the defi- 

 ciency is noted accordingly. I have sometimes had the skulls of both

INTRODUCTION. 



Europeans and Africans sent me by mistake for those of Indians ; that 

 these should occasionally be mingled in the same cemeteries is readily 

 understood; but a practised eye can separate them without difficulty. 



Large as this Collection already is, a glance at the Ethnological Table 

 will show that it is very deficient in some divisions of the human family. 

 For example it contains no skulls of the Eskimaux, Fuegians, Califor- 

 nians or Brazilians. The distorted heads of the Oregon tribes are also 

 but partially represented, while the long-headed people of the Lake of 

 Titicaca, in Bolivia, are altogether wanting. Skulls of the great divi- 

 sions of the Caucasian and Mongolian races are also too few for satisfac- 

 tory comparison, and the Sclavonic and Tchudic (Finnish) nations, to- 

 gether with the Mongol tribes of Northern Asia and China, are among 

 the especial desiderata of this Collection.*

 embraced in the entire series.f

 classification, but simply an arrangement adopted for convenience of study and exami- 

 nation. 



t Dr. Morton used the term Pelasgic too comprehensively. The Circassians, Arme-

The letters F. A. express ihQ facial angle, and I. C. refer to the inter- 

 nal capacity of the cranium as obtained by the process invented by my 

 friend, Mr. J. S. Phillips, and described in my Crania Americana, p. 263, 

 merely substituting leaden shot, one-eighth of an inch in diameter, in place 

 of the white mustard-seed originally used. I thus obtain the absolute 

 capacity of the cranium, or hulk of the brain, in cubic inches; and the 

 results are annexed in all other instances in which I have had leisure to 

 put this revised mode of measurement in practice. I have restricted it, 

 at least for the purpose of my inferential conclusions, to the crania of 

 persons of sixteen years of age and upwards, at which period the brain is 

 believed to possess the adult size. Under this age, the capacity-measure- 

 ment has only been resorted to for the purpose of collateral comparison. 



All the measurements in this Catalogue, both of the facial angle and 

 internal capacity, have been made with my own hands. I at one time 

 employed a person to aid me in these elaborate and fatiguing details ; but 

 having detected some errors in his measurements, I have been at the 

 pains to revise all that part of the series that had not been previously 

 measured by myself. I can now, therefore, vouch for the accuracy of 

 these multitudinous data, which I cannot but regard as a novel and im- 

 portant contribution to Ethnological science. 



It is necessary to add, that the measurements originally published in

 itself, owing to certain numbers having been cancelled, and not refilled. 




INTRODUCTION. 



the Crania Americana were made witli seeds, whicli will explain tlie dis- 

 crepancy between the numbers observable in that work and this Cata- 

 logue. The measurements of the Crania ^gyptiaca having been origin- 

 ally made with shot, require no revision ; nor can I avoid expressing my 

 satisfaction at the singular accuracy of this method, since a skull of an 

 hundred cubic inches, if measured any number of times with reasonable 

 care, will not vary a single cubic inch. 



I am now engaged in a memoir* which will embrace the detailed con- 

 clusions that result from these data ; and meanwhile I submit the follow- 

 ing tabular view of the prominent facts :

* Dr. Morton died before this memoir was completed. Extracts from it will be found in the fore- 

 going Explanatory Note. 



1 1 have enlarged this Table by the addition of 40 measurements, with the effect of increasing the 

 mean cranial capacity of the Teutonic Family, the Mongolian and American Groups, by 1.5, 5, and 

 1.3 cubic inches respectively; and slightly diminishing that of the Negro Group. In the preceding 

 Explanatory Note the reader will find a more detailed account of these measurements, togcthev 

 with others which have been made since Dr. Morton's death. 




18 INTRODUCTION. 



In this table the measurements of children, idiots and mixed races are 

 omitted, excepting only in the instance of the Fellahs of Egypt, who, 

 however, are a blended stock of two Caucasian nations, the true Egyp- 

 tian and the intrusive Arab, in which the characteristics of the former 

 greatly predominate. 



No mean has been taken of the Caucasian race* collectively, because 

 of the very great preponderance of Hindu, Egyptian, and Fellah skulls 

 over those of the Germanic, Pelasgic and Celtic families. Nor could any 

 just collective conipai'ison be instituted between the Caucasian and Negro 

 groups in such a table, unless the small-brained people of the latter divi- 

 sion (Hottentots, Bushmen and Australians) were proportionate in number 

 to the Hindoos, Egyptians and Fellahs of the other group. Such a com- 

 putation, were it practicable, would probably reduce the Caucasian 

 average to about 87 cubic inches, and the Negro to 78 at most, perhaps 

 even to 75, and thus confirmatively establish the difiFerence of at least 

 nine cubic inches between the mean of the two races.f 



Philadelphia, Nov. 1, 1849. 



* It is necessary to explain what is here meant by the word race. Further researches 

 into Ethnographic affinities will probably demonstrate that what are now termed the five 

 races of men, would be more appropriately called groups that each of these groups is 

 again divisible into a greater or smaller number of primary races, each of which has ex- 

 panded from an aboriginal nucleus or centre. Thus I conceive that there were several 

 centres for the American group of races, of which the highest in the scale are the Tolte- 

 can nations, the lowest the Fuegians. Nor does tliis view conflict with the general prin- 

 ciple, that all these nations and tribes have had, as I have elsewhere expressed it, a com- 

 mon origin ; inasmuch as by this term is only meant an indigenous relation to the country 

 they inhabit, and that collective identity of physical traits, mental and moral endowments, 

 language, &c., which chracterize all the American races. The same remarks are appli- 

 cable to all the other human races ; but in the present infant state of Etluiographic sci" 

 ence, the designation of these primitive centres is a task of equal delicacy and difficulty" 

 I may here observe, that whenever I have ventured an opinion on this question, it has been 

 in favor of the doctrine of primeval diversities among men an original adaptation of the 

 several races to those varied circumstances of climate and locality, which, while conge- 

 nial to the one, arc destructive to the other ; and subsequent investigations have confirmed 

 me in these views, See Crania Americaiia, p. 3 ; Crania Aigyptiaea, p, 37 ; Distinctive 

 Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America, p. 36 ; Sillimans American Journal 

 of Science and the Arts, 1847; and my letter to J. R. Bartlett, Esq., in Vol.2 of the Tran- 

 sactions of the Ethnological Society of New York.

1. 1260. Cast of a Norwegian skull. From Prof. Retzius, of Stock-

 ([This cast is remarkable for its great size. It belongs to the dolicho- 

 cephalic variety of Retzius. The fronto-parietal convexity is regu- 

 lar from side to side. The occipital region as a whole is quite pro- 

 minent ; but the basal portion of the occiput is flat and parallel 

 with the horizon when the head rests squarely upon the lower jaw. 

 The glabella^ superciliary ridges^ and external angular processes of 

 the OS frontis are very rough and prominent, overhanging the orbits 

 and inter-orbital space in such a manner as to give a very harsh 

 and forbidding expression to the face. The semi-circular ridges 

 passing back from the external angular process, are quite elevated 

 and sharp. The nasal bones are high and rather sharp at the line 

 of junction ; orbits spacious } malar bones of moderate size, and 

 flattened antero-laterally ; superior maxilla rather small in com- 

 parison with the inferior, which is quite large, and much flared 

 out at the angles. The facial angle is good, and the whole head 

 strongly marked.]

[The Swedish form of skull, judging from the above specimens, bears 

 a family resemblance to the Norwegian, and in several respects is 

 not unlike the Anglo-Saxon head figured in the first decade of the 

 Crania Britannica of Messrs. Davis and Thurnam. In theAnglo- 

 Saxon, however, the chin is more acuminated, and the maxillary 

 rami longer. The chief points of resemblance about the calvaria, 

 are the slightly elevated forehead, the rather flattened vertex, and 

 the inclination of the parietalia downwards and backwards towards 

 the occiput. This latter feature is also possessed by the Norwe- 

 gian cast referred to above.]

[In No. 1249 the singularly protuberant occiput projects far behind 

 the foramen magnum. Nos. 1255, 1550 and 1532 evidently belong 

 to the same peculiar type. These four heads resemble each other as 

 strongly as they differ from the remaining Swedes, Finns, Ger- 

 mans, and Kelts in the collection. They call to mind the kumbe- 

 kephalge, or boat-shaped skulls described by Prof. Wilson in his 

 Pre-liistoric Annals of Scotland. No. 1362, presents the same 

 elongated form. It differs from the four preceding skulls in being 

 larger, more massive, and broader in the forehead. Nos. 117, 1258, 

 and 1488 possess the true Swedish form as described above. Nos. 

 1545 and 1546 are broader, more angular, and less oval than the 

 tx'ue Swedish form. The horizontal portion of the occiput is quite 

 flat, and the occipital protuberance prominent. The three Suder- 

 manland Swedes have the same general form, while the three 

 Swedish Finns have a more squarely globular, and less oval cranium 

 than the true Swedes. In No. 121 the posterior region of the 

 calvaria is broader, and does not slope away so much. In general 

 configuration this cranium approaches the brachy-cephalic class of 

 Ketzius.]

22 CATALOGUE OP 



[The Finnish skull has a square or somewhat angularly round appear- 

 ance. The antero-posterior diameter being comparatively short, it 

 falls within the brachy-cephalic class of Retzius. The forehead is 

 broad, though less expansive than in the true Germanic race. This 

 frontal breadth, the lateral expansion of the parietalia, and the flat- 

 ness of" the OS occipitis, give to the coronal region, when viewed 

 perpendicularly, a square, or rather slightly oblong appearance. 

 The face is longer and less broad than in the Mongolian head, 

 while the lower jaw is larger, and the chin more prominent. 

 Hence, the lower part of the face is advanced, somewhat in the 

 manner of the Sclavonian face. The whole head is rather massive 

 and rude in structure, the bony prominences being strongly cha- 

 racterized, and the sutures well defined. The general configura- 

 tion of the head is European, bearing certain resemblances, how- 

 ever, to the Mongolian on the one hand, and the Sclavonian on the 

 other.]

For the preceding 8 skulls of the Germanic or Teutonic Race, I am 

 indebted to Dr. George Engelmann, now of St. Louis, Missouri. 



1. 434. A Dutchman of noble family, born in Utrecht, and for 

 several years a captain in the army at Batavia, in the Island of Java, 

 where he died under thirty years of age. He was handsome, not de- 

 ficient in talent, and of an amiable disposition, but devoted to con- 

 viviality and dissipation, which finally destroyed him. Dr. Doornik, 

 late of Batavia, from whom I obtained this cranium, gave me the 

 above facts from personal knowledge. F. A. 81. I. C. 114. 

 [The calvaria is very large ; the face rather small, delicate, well- 

 formed, and tapering towards the chin. The frontal diameter or 

 breadth between the temples, is 4^ inches; the greatest breadth 

 between the parietal protubei'ances is 6| inches; the antero-poste- 

 rior or longitudinal diameter is 71 inches; the height, measured 

 from the anterior edge of the foramen magnum, in a direct line to 

 the sagittal suture, 5H inches. A certain angularity or squareness 

 of the frontal and posterior bi-parietal regions, gives to this head 

 the Teutonic form. The posterior or occipital region is flat and 

 broad, and presents to the eye a somewhat pentagonal outline. 

 The temporal regions are full, the mastoid processes large, and 

 the basis cranii nearly round. The outline of the coronal region

resembles a triangle, truncated at the apex. This latter feature is 

 also seen in one of the Finnic skulls (No. 1538).]

 near Lausanne in Switzerland. Procured by Mr. Trojon, a cele- 

 brated Archaeologist, who considers this skull to have been 2000 

 years in the tomb. Presented by Prof. Retzius subsequent to Dr. 

 Morton's death. 



IV. ANGLO-SAXON KACE. 



{Case 1.) 



1. 80. Skull of an Englishman named Samuel Gwillym, a con- 

 vict in Australia, whose history is thus briefly given by my friend 

 Dr. C. HuflPnagle, now of Calcutta : 



'' Transported to Van Diemen's laud in 1820 for house-breaking ; 

 was orderly on ship-board, but subsequently robbed his master, for 

 which he was sent for two years to Maria Island : while there was 

 flogged for combination, and also received 100 lashes for stealing 

 articles from the wreck of the Apollo. Returning to Van Diemen's 

 land he was fined twice for drunkenness; and was executed there 

 on the 16th of March, 1837, for the murder of Mary Mills, a young 

 woman whom he had previously violated." I. C. 91. 



[This skull belongs to the dolicho-cephalic class, but is not strictly 

 oval, being flattened posteriorly. In general configuration it re- 

 sembles the Northern or Grothic style of head. The face bears the 

 Finnic stamp.] 



2. 539. Skull of James Moran, an Englishman, who was executed 

 at Philadelphia for piracy and murder. May 19, 1837. -^tat. 20. 

 F. A. 79. I. C. 92. 



[This skull is long, flat on the top, and broad between the parietal 

 bones. The posterior portion of the occiput is prominent, the basal 

 surface is flat. In its general outline, the calvaria approaches 

 the kumbe-kephalic form.]

5. 552. x\nglo-American : man, aetat. 30. I. C. 97. This skull 

 belonged to the collection of the late Dr. Doornik, and was pre- 

 sented to me with other crania, by Dr. Jones, of New Orleans, 



* A letter addressed to me by Wm. Cobb Hurry, Esq., of Calcutta, contains 

 the following particulars of this man's singular career : 



" With regard to the cannibal Pierce, all that is known of him is, that he was 

 a native of Scotland, or the north of Ireland, and a seaman. He was a convict 

 in Van Diemeu's land, and escaped with others into the woods. Hunger com- 

 jjelled them to prey upon each other, till only Pierce and another were left. A 

 romantic tale might be made from Pierce's own narrative of the feelings with 

 which these two men watched each other, till, overcome with fatigue, the last 

 of the band fell a victim. Pierce was relieved by a party who fell in with him, 

 and the cannibalism of which he was guilty being attributed to necessity, was 

 not punished. From that time his propensities acquired their full development, 

 and he succeeded repeatedly in persuading his fellow prisoners to escape with 

 him, for the sole pui'pose of killing them and devouring their flesh. He used to 

 return secretly to the depot, and persuade a fresh victim that he had been sent 

 by others who were waiting in the woods. He was at last caught ; and being 

 asked if he knew where one of his companions was, deliberately pulled an arm 

 out of his jacket and showed it to the soldiers. Mr. Crockett, from whom I had 

 this account, and who gave me the skull, is the Colonial Surgeon, and attended 

 Pierce in the hospital both before and subsequently to his crimes. He stated to 

 me his conviction that Pierce was insane, which, however, did not prevent him 

 from being hanged."

 types.] 



2. 21. Celt : supposed to be a British soldier, killed at the battle

 the great size of the superciliary ridges ; that of the right side hav- 

 ing a corresponding frontal sinus, that on the left being represented 

 by solid bone upwards of half an inch in horizontal thickness. Dr. 

 Mickle, 1831. [In this head the Gothic calvarial form is asso- 

 ciated with a heavy, massive face.]

broad, and flat ; the orbits capacious ; and the distance from the 

 root of the nose to the upper alveolus quite short. In its general 

 form, it very much resembles the Cimbrie skull. No. 1362. The 

 Cimbric type, however, is somewhat narrower in the frontal region, 

 and widens more posteriorly towards the parietal protuberances.]

SciiAVONIAN (1251). 



[This skull presents the following characters :-^General form of the 

 head globular, though wanting in symmetry, in consequence of the 

 posterior portion of the right parietal bone being more fully de- 

 veloped than the corresponding portion of the left ; the calvaria 

 quite large in proportion to the face, and broadest posteriorly be- 

 tween the parietal protuberances; the forehead is high, and mode- 

 rately broad ; the vertex presents a somewhat flattened appearance, 

 in consequence of sloping downwards and backwards towards the 

 occiput ; the occipital region is also flat, and the breadth between

the mastoid processes very great. The face is small and delicate, 

 the nasal bones prominent, the orbits of moderate size, the malar 

 bones flat and delicately rounded, and the zygomatic processes small 

 and slender. The lower jaw is rather small, rounded at the an- 

 gles, and quite acuminated at the symphysis. If classified according 

 to its form, this head would find its place near to, if not between, 

 the Kalmuck and Turkish types.]

VIII. PELASGIC RACE. 



{Case 2.) 

 1. 1352. Ancient Phenician ? 



I received this highly interesting relic from M. F. Fresnel, the distin- 

 guished French archasologist and traveller, with the following memo- 

 randum, A. D. 1847 : 

 " Crane provenant des caves sepulchrales de Ben-Djemma, dans Tile 

 de Malte. Ce crane parait avoir appartenu a uu individu de la race 

 qui, dans les temps les plus anciens, occupaitla cote septentrionale 

 de I'Afrique, et les iles adjacentes." 



Phenician (1352). 



[This cranium is the one "alluded to in the interestino- anecdote 

 narrated by the late Dr. Patterson, in his graceful memoir as 

 illustrating the wonderful power of discrimination, the tactusvisus 

 acquired by Dr. Morton in his long and critical study of crani- 

 ology.* From this circumstance, and from the many sino-ular and 

 interesting associations inseparably connected with its antiquity, the 

 introduction of the above figure cannot fail to be received with a 



<^ See Types of Mankind, p. xl. 




HUMAN CRANIA. 29 



lively sense of interest by those engaged in these studies. It is in 

 many respects a peculiar skull. In a profile view, the eye quickly 

 notices the remarkable length of the occipito-mental diameter. 

 This feature gives to the whole head an elongated appearance, 

 which is much heightened by the general narrowness of the calva- 

 ria, the backward slope of the occipital region, and the strong prog- 

 nathous tendency of the maxillae. The contour of the coronal 

 region is a long oval, which recalls to mind the kumbe-kephalic 

 form of Wilson. The moderately well-developed forehead is nota- 

 ^ ble for its regularity. In its form and general characters the face 

 is sui generis. It may not inaptly be compared to a double wedge, 

 for the facial bones are not only inclined downwards and remarkably 

 forward, thus tapering towards the chin, but also in consequence 

 of the flatness of the malar bones and the inferior maxillary rami 

 they appear laterally compressed, sloping gently, on both sides, 

 from behind forwards, towards the median line. The lower jaw is 

 large, and much thrown forwards. The slope of the superior max- 

 illa forms an angle with the horizon of about 45. Notwithstanding 

 this inclination of the maxilla, the incisor teeth are so curved as to 

 be nearly vertical. Hence the prognathism of the jaws is quite 

 peculiar, differing, as it does, from that of the Eskimo and true 

 African skulls presently to be noticed.] 

 1. 1049. Fragments of an ancient Roman? head, from a tomb on 

 the road between Cumae and the ruins of Baise, near the latter place, 

 A. D. 1841. Dr. M. Burrough. 



1. 1354. Cast of the skull of a young Greek. Prof. Retzius. 

 [The calvarial region is well developed ; the frontal expansive and 

 prominent ; the facial line departs but slightly from the perpen- 

 dicular, and the facial angle consequently approaches a right angle. 

 A small and regularly-formed face, devoid of asperities, harmonizes 

 well with the general intellectual character of the head proper. 

 The malar bones are small, flat, and smooth, with just enough lateral 

 prominence to give to the face an oval outline ; the alveolar mar- 

 gins of the maxillae are regularly arched, and the teeth perpen- 

 dicular.]

Circassian (764). 

 [The calvaria of No. 764 is well developed and regularly arched, and 

 in size considerably exceeds the face. The proportions between the 

 vertical, transverse, and longitudinal diameters are such as to con- 

 vey to the eye an impression of harmony and regularity of structure. 

 The high and broad forehead forms with the parietal region a con- 

 tinuous and symmetrical convexity. The occiput is full and pro- 

 minent. The face is strongly marked ; the orbits moderate in size ; 

 the nasal bones prominent ; the malar bones small and rounded ; 

 the teeth vertical ; the maxillae of medium size, and the chin pro- 

 minent. The fulness of the face, its oval contour, and general 

 want of angularity, decidedly separate this head from the Mongo- 

 lian type, as represented by the Kalmuck skull. No. 1553.]

3. 1333. Affghan boy, about 16 years of age, killed at Jugdalluk 

 during tbe memorable massacre of the 44tli English regiment, A. 

 D. 1845. 

 [A general family resemblance pervades all these crania. They are 

 all, with one exception, remarkable for the smallness of the face, 

 and shortness of the head. In the Armenian skull, the forehead is 

 narrow but well formed, the convexity expanding upwards and 

 backwards towards the parietal protuberances, and laterally towards 

 the temporal bones. The greatest transverse diameter is between 

 the parietal bosses. This feature, combined with the flatness of 

 the occiput, gives to the coronal region an outline somewhat re- 

 sembling a triangle with all three angles truncated, and the base of 

 the triangle looking posteriorly. In fact, the whole form of the 

 calvaria is such as to impress the mind of the observer with a sense 

 of squareness and angularity. The dimensions of the orbits are 

 moderate; the malar bones small, flat, and retreating; the zygo- 

 matic processes slender, and the general expression of the face re- 

 sembling that of the Circassians, from which latter it difi"ers in 

 being shorter. The Persian head is less angular, the frontal region 

 broader, the occiput fuller, and the malar bones larger. The lower 

 jaw is small and rather round. The Afi"ghan skull resembles, in 

 several respects, the Hindoo type.]

The two following crania were found by Mr. Perring, Civil Engineer, 

 in the gallery leading to the newly discovered chamber in the 

 Pyramid of Five Steps, at Saccara. These are, perhaps, the most 

 ancient human remains extant. Mr. Perring is of opinion that they 

 date with the erection of the Pyramid, and are therefore in all pro-

smootti forehead is devoid of the keel-like formation perceptible in 

 the Eskimo. The carinated ridge makes its appearance along the 

 middle and posterior part of the inter-parietal suture. The widest 

 transverse diameter is near the superior edge of the temporal bone ; 

 from this point the diameter contracts both above and below. As 

 in the Eskimo, the occiput is full and prominent, as is also the 

 posterior surface of the parietal bones, which surface, in the Eski- 

 mo, however, is flat. The forehead inclines upwards and back- 

 wards to a prominence in the middle of the inter-parietal suture, 

 from which point it is rounded off posteriory. The face forms a 

 broad oval ; the orbits are large, deep, and have their transverse 

 ax* at right angles with the median line of the face. The malar 

 bones, though large, are neither so prominent nor high as in the 

 Eskimo. They are laterally compressed, more rounded, and less 

 flared out at their inferior margin in the Polar man. The anterior 

 nares are flat and smooth, and the alveolar arch somewhat more 

 prominent than in the typical Eskimo, as is shown by comparing 

 them by the norma verticalis. Upon examining the basis cranii, 

 we observe, at once, the globular fulness of tbe occipital region, 

 and an alteration in the general configuration of the base, as com- 

 pared with that of the true Arctic skull. The greatest breadth is 

 not confined to the zygomatic region, for lines drawn from the most 

 prominent point of the zygomae to the most prominent point of the 

 mastoid process, on either side, are parallel to each other.]

rin the accompanying figure, the reader will observe that the cra- 



4 




50 CATALOGUE OF 



nium is nearly globular, while the forehead is broad, flat, and less 

 receding than in the Eskimo and Kamtskatkan. Without being 

 ridged or keel-like, the median line of the cranium forms a regular 

 arch, the most prominent point of which is at the junction of the 

 coronal and sagittal sutures. Behind and above the meatus, the 

 head swells out into a globe or sphere, instead of tapering away 

 postero-laterally towards the median line, as in the Eskimo crania. 

 This appearance is also well seen in the head figured by Blumen- 

 bach.* He says of it, "habitus totius cranii quasi inflatus et 

 tumidus." The eye at once detects the striking difi'erence between 

 the facial angle of this cranium and that of the Eskimo figured on 

 the next page. In the latter, the facial bones resemble a huge wedge 

 lying in front of the head proper. This appearance, it is true, is 

 somewhat dependent upon the obtuseness of the angle of the lower 

 jaw, but mainly, as will be seen, upon the prominent chin and 

 prognathous jaw. In the Kalmuck, the facial bones form a sort 

 of oblong figure, and are by no means so prominent. The face is 

 broad, flat, and square ; the superciliary ridges are massive and 

 prominent ; the orbits are large, and directed somewhat outwards ; 

 the ossa nasi are broad and rather flat, forming an obtuse 

 angle with each other ; the malar bones are large, strong, protuber- 

 ant, and roughly marked.]

 which represent the front and lateral views of the head above men-

 just below the orbits ; malar bones broad, high, and prominent, the 

 external surface looking antero-laterally ; orbits large and straight ; 

 zygomatic arches massive and widely separated ; length of the face 

 one inch less than the breadth ; nasal bones flat, narrow, and united 

 at an obtuse angle, sometimes lying in the same plane as the naso-

 its anterior surface flat and smooth, superior alveolar margin oval ; 

 inferior margin of anterior nares flat, smooth, inclining forwards 

 and downwards ; inferior maxilla large, long, and triangular ; semi- 

 lunar notch quite shallow; angles of the jaw flared out, and chin 

 prominent ; teeth large, and worn in such a manner as to present, 

 in the upper jaw, an inclination from without inwards, upwards, 

 and laterally, and in the lower jaw, just the reverse ; antero-pos-

 The female cranium differs from the male in being smaller, lighter, 

 and presenting a smoother surface and more delicate structure.

 and the anterior surface of the superior maxilla concave rather 

 than flat.]

 face-bones completely and somewhat skilfully separated from the 

 head ; which, so far as I can learn, was a customary usage in the 

 performance of human sacrifices : and these remains were probably 

 disinterred from that part of the Moral devoted in former years to 

 this class of persons. Capt. Cook's head, when restored to his

 whom I also received the following memorandum, A. D. 1849 : 



" This skull was exhumed from a mound, the apex of which is about 

 thirty feet above the ground in its vicinity. The locality is Bald- 

 win county, Alabama, near Bear Point, on the west side of the Bay 

 of Perdido, and about two or three miles north of the shore of the 

 Gulf of Mexico. Near the apex of the mound there stood a live oak 

 tree, supposed to be more than 100 years old. Near the foot of 

 this live oak the party made their excavations, and a few feet be- 

 low the surface they found the skull which I have had the happi- 

 ness to place among your collection. The skull was covered with 

 a hollow demi-sphere of pottery, composed of clay and shell, well 

 burned. Upon the convex surface were sketched two whales, rather 

 rudely, but sufficiently well to be recognizable." 



24. 1512. Aboriginal American ; a very remarkable head, found by 

 Dr. Davis and Mr. Squier in a mound in the Scioto Valley, Ohio, 

 and described and figured by them in their " Ancient Monuments 

 of the Mississippi Valley," PI. XLVII. and XLVIII. This is, per- 

 haps, the most admirably-formed head of the American race hitherto 

 discovered. It possesses the national characteristics in perfection, 

 as seen in the elevated vertex, flattened occiput, great interparietal 

 diameter, ponderous bony structure, salient nose, large jaws and 

 broad face. It is the perfect type of Indian conformation, to which

and have the occiput, as in this instance, so flattened and vertical 

 as to give the idea of artificial compression ; yet this is only an ex- 

 aggeration of the natural form, caused by the pressure of the cradle- 

 hoard in common use among the American nations. F. A. 81^. 

 I. C. 90. Dr. E. H. Davis and E. G. Squier, Esq., A. D. 1849. 



" The circumstances," writes Mr. Squier, ia the work above quoted, " under 

 which this skull was found, are altogether so extraordinary as to merit a 

 detailed account. It will be observed, from the map, that the mound above 

 indicated is situated upou the summit of a high hill, overlooking the valley 

 of the Scioto, about four miles below the city of Chilicothe. It is one of 

 the most prominent and commanding positions in that section of country. 

 Upon the summit of this hill rises a conical knoll, of so great regularity as 

 almost to induce the belief that it is itself artificial. Upon the very apex 

 of this knoll, and covered by the trees of the primitive forests, is the mound. 

 It is about eight feet high, by forty or fifty feet base. The superstructure is 

 a tough, yellow clay, which, at the depth of three feet, is mixed with large, 

 rough stones ; as shown in the accompanying section. 



" These stones rest upon a dry, calcareous deposit of buried earth and small 

 stones, of a dark black color, and much compacted. This deposit is about 

 two feet in thickness in the centre, and rests upon the original soil. In ex- 

 cavating the mound, a large i^late of mica was discovered, placed upon the 

 stones. * * * * * Immediately underneath this plate 

 of mica, and in the centre of the buried deposit was found the skull figured 

 [on the opposite page.] It was discovered resting upon its face. The 

 lower jaw, as indeed the entire skeleton, excepting the clavicle, a few 

 cervical vertebrae, and some of the bones of the feet, all of which were 

 huddled around the skull, were wanting. 



"From the entire singularity of this burial, it might be inferred that the de- 

 posit was a comparatively recent one; but the fact that the various layers 

 of carbonaceous earth, stones, and clay were entirely undisturbed, and in 

 no degree intermixed, settles the question beyond doubt that the skull was 



placed where it was found at the time of the construction of the mound. 

 ***** -x- 



" This skull is wonderfully preserved ; unaccountably so, unless the circum- 

 stances under which it was found may be regarded as most favorable to 

 such a result. The imperviousness of the mound to water, from the 

 nature of the material composing it, and its position on the summit of 

 an eminence, subsiding in every direction from its base, are circumstances

which, joined to the antiseptic qualities of the carbonaceons deposit 

 enveloping the skull, may satisfactorily account for its excellent preser- 

 vation." (See pp. 288-9.)

 heads, Nos. 654, 655, 656, were taken from chiefs killed in an en- 

 counter with the Chilian army under General Bulnes, on the river 

 Bio-Bio, in 1835. I took occasion, however, to intimate to Dr. 




74 CATALOGUE OP 



Casanova my suspicion that these were not recent crania, inasmuch 

 as they had yet adhering to them some shreds of a peculiar mummy- 

 cloth common in the old cemeteries of Peru and Chili, at the same 

 time that they bore unequivocal evidences of long inhumation. 

 Dr. Casanova, however, could not suppose that he had been de- 

 ceived by his agent, and I therefore published the circumstances as 

 related by him, and on his authority, in my Crania Americana, 

 page 243. I may add that, judging from the size and conforma- 

 tion of the skull No. 654, I inferred that it had belonged not to a 

 chief, as was supposed by Dr. C, but to a woman. 



Subsequent examinations have satisfied me that my suspicions were 

 well founded; and I am further- confirmed in this belief by com- 

 paring these crania with the plates of a series obtained by the 

 Naturalists of the Astrolabe from an ancient cemetery on the Bio- 

 Bio river, near its confluence with the Moticha in Chili. It is 

 suflScient to add that both collections of skulls were evidently ob- 

 tained from the same place ; and, although Dr. Casanova was mis- 

 led as to particulars, the crania I received from him pertain to a 

 veritable but ancient Araucanian tribe, and possess a great interest, 

 both in regard to their sepulchral locality and their admirably de- 

 veloped characteristics. See Voyage del' Astrolabe: AntJiropologie

The following highly interesting series of crania, ten in number, 

 (1275 to 1284, inclusive,) was sent me by my friend William A. 

 Foster, Esq., now of Lima, who obtained them from the cele- 

 brated Peruvian cemetery at Arica. " This cemetery,'' he observes, 

 " lies on the face of a sand-hill, sloping towards the sea. The ex- 

 tent of surface occupied by these tombs, as far as we explored, I 

 should say was five or six acres. In many of the tombs three or 

 four bodies were found clustered together, always in the sittiny 

 posture, and wrapped in three or four thicknesses of cloth, and a 

 mat thrown over all. Each one has about the person a pouch or 

 bag, an ear or two of maize, fruit of some kind, and not unfre. 

 quently a drinking vessel." Lima, December 17, 1845.

 was pressed downwards and backwards by a compress probably of 

 folded cloth. To keep it in its place, a bandage was carried over 

 it from the base of the occiput and thence across the forehead. To 

 confine the lateral portions of the skull, and in order to produce

For the preceding series of Peruvian crania from Pisco, I am indebt- 

 ed to my friend "Wm. A. Foster, Esq., formerly of this city, and 

 now a resident of Lima, who accompanied them with the following 

 memorandum : 



" These skulls were all collected from the surface of three or four 

 liuacas (tumuli) within a short distance, perhaps a couple of miles, 

 of each other, having been disturbed and left lying there by pre- 

 vious diggers; that is, by the common people of the country, who 

 are full of notions about buried treasure. All the huacas I saw 

 were evidently those of the poorer classes. 



" The whole country around Pisco is covered with Indian remains. 

 It is a rich valley, with a small stream running through it, and has 

 every appearance of having been thickly populated and well and 

 extensively cultivated."

The preceding eleven skulls of Native Africans were received A. D. 

 1842, from Dr. S. M. E. Goheen, for several years physician to the 

 colony of Liberia in Western Africa. 



[The Golah skull (No. 1093), is remarkable for its massiveness and 

 density. The calvaria is well-formed, expanding fron the frontal 

 region back towards the occiput, which is flat and shelving. The 

 two halves of the os frontis form a double inclined plane, whose 

 summit coincides with the sagittal suture. The basis cranii is 

 full and round, and the mastoid processes large; nasal bones flat, 

 and falling in below the glabella ; orbits large, and widely sepa-

rated ; malar bones laterally prominent. This latter feature, in 

 conjunction with the double inclination of the os frontis, gives to 

 the head a pyramidal form. The superior maxilla is distinctly 

 everted at the alveolar margin. Another head of the same tribe 

 is longer and narrower, and, in consequence of the flatness of the 

 malar bones, has less of the pyramidal form. The calvaria of a 

 Pessah skull (No. 1095) is oblong in figure ; the forehead flat, 

 and receding ; superciliary ridges ponderous ; malar bones large 

 and flat; upper jaw everted; lower jaw retracted, occiput pro- 

 tuberant. In a Kroo head (No. 1098), I find the forehead broad 

 and high ; the calvaria regularly arched, and having its greatest 

 diameter between the anterior and inferior parts of the parietalia ; 

 the occipital region flat and shelving downwards and forwards to 

 a small foramen magnum ; mastoid processes large ; face very 

 broad ; malar bones shelving slightly like those of the Eskimo ; 

 inter-orbital space very large; upper jaw slightly everted ; teeth 

 rather small, and vertical ; zygomatic fossae deep. In another 

 Kroo skull, the vertex is flat, the forehead recedent, and the jaws 

 more prognathous. The calvaria of a Dey skull is narrow in front 

 and broad posteriorly, with a flat vertex ; face small, regular, and 

 compact, and, were it not for the projection of the superior alve- 

 olus, might be considered as almost European. The skull of an 

 Eboe (No. 1102), presents characters similar to those just de- 

 tailed. It is chiefly remarkable for the great obliquity of the 

 orbital opening, and the unusual smallness of the mastoid pro- 

 cesses.] 



82. 1224. Congo Negro ; a young native. Remarkable for the ab- 

 sence of the coronal, sagittal and lambdoidal sutures. Dr. David 

 Gilbert, 1844.

 heads low ; the whole face small and prognathous, the slope, from

the glabella to the upper alveolus, being continuous ; the occipital 

 region protuberant. Only one of these heads approximates the 

 pyramidal form. The two Kaffir skulls are characterized by high, 

 peaked foreheads ; the sagittal suture marked by a prominent ridge, 

 and the calvaria pyramidal in form.]

These two Hovah skulls were procured by Lieut. Isaac G. Strain, 

 U. S. N., at Majunga, Bembatooka Bay, on the west coast of 

 Madagascar, A. D. 1846. 



The Hovahs, who constitute the ruling caste of this island, are a 

 black race closely allied to the Kaffers. They are more or less 

 blended with the Arabs, Hindus and Malays, but not to such a 

 degree as to materially affect their national traits or their peculiar 

 language, as Mr. Crawfurd has shown, 



[These two Hovah skulls have the base long and narrow, the vertex 

 flat, the orbits narrow and high, and the superior maxillae promi- 

 nent.]

[It is a truly animal head. The forehead is exceedingly flat and re-

flat, and the mastoid processes very large and roughly formed. 

 The immense orbits are overhung by ponderous superciliary 

 ridges. This latter feature is still more evident in No. 1451 of 

 the Collection, which, though varying somewhat in type, presents 

 in general the same brutal appearance.]

 fore his death, he called the nurse to him and confessed as follows : 

 That eighteen or twenty years before, having a hatred against 

 another boy of his own color, two years younger than himself, he 

 strangled and killed him. After committing the murder he be- 

 came alarmed, and placed the dead body in a chair near the win- 

 dow, hoping to revive it. He then fled ; and not having been seen 

 to enter the house was never suspected of the murder ; and the boy, 

 being found dead in the chair, was supposed to have died of apo- 

 plexy. I have these facts and the skull from my friend Dr. Adol- 

 phus L. Heerman.
