The death of Baron Edmond de Selys-Longchamps, a corre-

The Food of the Cod. — De. Benjamix Shaef called attention 

 to some observations he had made last fall on the contents of tlie 

 stomachs of the common Cod. Several hundred stomachs were 

 opened with the hope of finding shells of gastropods and bivalves. 

 Numerous valuable shells had been taken from the Cod years ago 

 by Stimpgou and Gnuld on the New England coast, north of Cape 

 Cod, and it was supposed that similar finds would come to light 

 from the Cod caught off Nantucket. The stomachs examined 

 were filled almost exclusively with crustaceans and for the most 

 part with species of Punopeus. Hermit crabs, without shells, and 

 a few Crepiduke were also seen. Here and there young lobsters 

 were found in the stomachs, occasionally two in one stomach. In 

 one Cod, weighing about thirty-five pounds, pieces of a lobster were 

 found which, when placed together, indicated that the possessor 

 was about eleven inches in length. 



The Cod examined were all taken off the eastern end of the 

 island, between the town of Siasconset and a place called AVawinet, 

 where the tide (current) runs at a maximum of about six miles 

 an hour. The bottom consists of coarse sand and is probably 

 shifting, and consequently not a good bed for mollusks, the only 

 food for the Cod found there being crustacean. 



Dr. Sharp supposed that the decrease in quantity of the lobsters, 

 which has been so marke<l within the past few years, is partly due 

 to their consumption by the Cod; and as these have of late greatly 

 increased in numbers, owing to the work of tlie United States Fish 

 Commission, the lobsters have not been able to keep pace with the 

 increase of their enemies.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF CHARLES EASTWICK SMITH. 

 BY aHOMAS MEEHAX. 



Appointed to prepare a memoir of our late fellow-member, 

 Charles E. Smith, the author feels strongly a difficulty he has 

 experienced on similar occasions. The members of the Academy 

 meet for mutual improvement and stud}'. The various subjects 

 in which they take interest become the chief topics of conver- 

 sation. They know little of the outside life of one another. A tree 

 is to be known only by its fruit. As it grows through successive 

 years it appears much like other trees, and no note is taken of the 

 incidents of its growth ; but when the harvest time arrives, and 

 all are in praise of the bountiful crop, carrying pleasure aad profit 

 around it in every direction, a natural desire arises to know more of 

 the details of such a happy career, — a desire that can only be sat- 

 isfied by recalling circumstances imperfectly remembered, or that 

 have but little bearing on the character we would illustrate. 



So wheu the subject of this memoir passed away few of his asso- 

 ciates could aid the author. All knew that he was one of Phila- 

 delphia's most prominent citizens ; that he had been at the head 

 of some of its great business bodies ; that he had been largel_y 

 concerned with the city's good name and progress; that he had 

 long been a member of the Academy of Natui-al Sciences of Phil- 

 adelphia, especially interested in botany and kindred subjects, a 

 liberal contributor through the greater part of his life to its build- 

 ing funds, its collections and general progress, and that on his 

 death it was found that he had generously provided for its future 

 out of his rich estate. But few knew more than all knew. In- 

 deed, but for aid from Dr. Edward J. Xolan and Dr. Thomas C. 

 Porter the author would have been left solely to his own recollec- 

 tions and the replies to letters of inquiry sent to friends of our 

 departed associate for material for his task. 



His full name was Charles Eastwick Smith — Eastwick being the 

 maiden name of his grandmother. He was the second of that 

 name in the family, the first dying before he was born. His 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 5 



Philadelphia ancestors were amiing the original party with William 

 Penu and, like the founder of the city, strong believers in the 

 doctrines of the Society of Friends. Little can be learned of his 

 early life. He was born November 1, 1820, and seems to have 

 had especial care and oversight from his mother, to whom he was 

 deeply devoted through life, and by whose side in Laurel Hill Ceme- 

 tery he was placed when his own time of rest arrived. He proba- 

 bly received his rudimentary education in Philadelphia, and at the 

 age of fifteen was sent to the boarding-school of Westtown, near 

 this cit}'. It was here, as he related to his friend Dr. Porter, that 

 he acquired his fondness for botany, through the influence of one 

 of the instructors. He remained here three years, when he became 

 attached to an engineer corps, engaged to survey for a railroad from 

 Blossburg to Corning, in New York. He became the superinten- 

 dent of the railroad, and later of the Bloomsburg coal mines, 

 though he had scarcely attained his majority He returned to 

 Philadelphia in 18 12, and established the Fairmount Rolling Mill. 

 This was not a financial success, from the fact, as he believed, 

 that cooperation throughout the whole iron trade was needed to 

 place the industry on a firm fooling. .He sold it out in 1846. 



About this period an event occurred that had a material influ- 

 ence on his future life. In 1844 a fierce antagonism to Roman 

 Catholicism arose. A number of churches were burned. The 

 Mayor called on all able-bodied citizens to arm in defense of law 

 and order. The Quaker youth went out with a cane, but in the 

 excitement of the riot smne one put a musket in his hands, and 

 he patroled the streets with it for seven nights. For this violation 

 of the principle of non-resistance he was called on to express 

 regret, and to give a promise of strict conformity to the rule 

 thereafter. Believing himself harshly treated, he refused to do 

 so and was expelled from the Society. He at once dropped the 

 garb and language of the Friends and associated with other 

 bodies. He never married, and if the event detailed had aught to 

 do with tlie fact, the secret was faithfully kept to the last. 



For a short time subsequent to 184(> he became manager of the 

 Rensselaer Iron Works, at Troy, N. Y., in which railroad iron 

 was being manufactured. He returned to Philadelphia in 1849, 

 to inaugurate a convention of iron men. The poverty of the con- 

 stituency forced the association to be content with inferior printing 




6 PfiOtEELINGS OF TBE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



and paper for its report. In a letter to a friend he says: " Mr. 

 Colville told me we must go over the State and get the interest of 

 every iron-maker. I askjd him for money to pay my expimses. 

 He said I must beg it, as he had none. ' You must ask for con- 

 tributions as yon go along.' I started with 85. Sometimes I got 

 a wagon, sometimes a horse ride, sometimes on foot — sometimes I 

 got fifty cents. In one case 1 got §10. I saw them all, came 

 back with between 8200 and SdOO, and the American Iron and 

 Steel Association became a flourishing body.'' He traveled 2,500 

 miles on this mission. 



There seems nothinjj on record as to his occupation for the suc- 

 ceeding ten years, but in a letter to a friend he remarks that he 

 attended faithfully to his office work during the day and employed 

 his evenings in studying and classifying the plants collected on 

 Sunday. 



In lt61 he was elected to the presidency of the Reading Rail- 

 road Company. From a comparatively local and almost bankrupt 

 organization, he raised it to one of broad interest and a good divi- 

 dend-paying concern — so pi'ofitable that in the trying times of the 

 beginning of the civil war .his company loaned the Government 

 two millions and a half of dollars. In 1869 it stood in prosperity 

 second to none in the country. 



His health broke down. His medical adviser urged his resigna- 

 tion and suggested several things he might do At length the 

 physician, in a peculiar way, remarked that he had " better go to 

 grass." The joke had a good effect. He took the advice literally, 

 resigned, and turned to botanj' for consolation. He still retained 

 his position on the Board of Directors. On the ]8th of April, 

 1869, he sailed on the " Scotia" for an extended tour of Europe, 

 during which botanical study was his chief recreation, although 

 he deeply enjoyed all that would interest a broad-miuded man of 

 affairs. He leturned on the 15th of September, 1870. 



Some years later he discovered that the great railroad company 

 that had been the pride of his life, was bankrupt under the man- 

 agement of his successor in the presidencj'. The effect on his 

 health was seriously depressing. By night, as by day, the rail- 

 road was ever in his mind. While greatly troubled by insomnia, 

 he was requested by the Secretaiy of the Academy to read the 

 proof-sheets of a botanical paper in course of publication. To his 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7 



surprise he found that the mental application required for proof- 

 reading was an excellent remedy for his sleeplessness. The applica- 

 tion required for the task drove out thoughts of the railroad's dis- 

 aster. He begged for more, both from the Academy and from 

 friends, and the greater part of his subsequent life was devoted, 

 as one of the best means for preserving health, to his favorite 

 occupation of proof-reading. 



Though not courting favors, he was highly esteemed by his 

 fellow-citizens. For two successive years, 1877 and 1878, he 

 ■was elected president of the Union League — one of the most 

 enviable of Philadelphia's social positions. 



His eminently practical character has lieeu well illustrated by 

 the reference to his journey through the State in the interests of 

 the iron men, and by the details of his railroad affairs. He car- 

 ried this quality into all his transactions. His close friend. Prof. 

 T. C. Porter, relates that on a trip with him, Aubrey H. Smith 

 and Dr. Joseph Leidy, in July and August, 1865, to Lake Supe- 

 rior, they were much amused by his practical test of the truth of 

 the Abbe Hue's statement that cow " cake " was better for kind- 

 ling, but that horse " apples " were better for holding heat in a 

 fire. The result proved the correctness of Abbe Hue's assertion. 

 Dr. Porter further notes, as illustrative of the tendency to draw 

 valuable conclusions from little things, that one of the party, 

 having placed over the fire a branch of a spruce tree to aid in 

 extinguishing it. Smith noted how the turpentine oozed from the 

 twigs, flashed into a blaze and sent up as incense a cloud of 

 fragrant white smoke. 



With all his love of facts, he was not devoid of sentiment. 

 His private correspondence discloses an active interest in the good 

 of others of which the world will never know. Few have suc- 

 ceeded so well in preventing the left hand from knowing what the 

 right hand was doing. His selection of a burial place in Laurel 

 Hill. Cemetery for his mother, on a spot that commanded the most 

 delightful views of the Schuylkill and the surroundings, is a strik- 

 ing testimony to his depth of sentiment. 



We have already seen how he was early brought into a love for 

 botany at the boarding-schocl. He was elected a member of the 

 Academy in 1851, and served in some of the administrative offices 

 until his death. He was appointed on the Puljlicatiou Committee 




8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



iu 1892, in which posilion he rendered especially valuable service. 

 He served on the Finance Committee from December, 1890, and 

 was one of the Council from May, 1891. At the time of his 

 death he was, and had been for a number of years, Vice-Director 

 of the Botanical Section. 



His influence on American botany, and on American science 

 generally, was exerted iu such a quiet way that its full im- 

 portance will never be appreciated. His critical mind led him 

 to prefer difficult subjects; hence carices, grasses and rushes 

 had especial charms for him. He could readily see what others 

 failed to observe, and he became an authority on these subjects. 

 While in the midst of his heavy labors in reconstructing the rail- 

 road company, he was in active correspondence with Boott, Olney, 

 Eugelmann and other specialists in the study of these difficult 

 genera. He rather prided himself on going over oft-trodden 

 ground and noting what others failed to see. By his jDersistency 

 with Dr. Gray he. finally induced this great botanist to recognize 

 two new species from oft-explored localities in New Jersey, which 

 he named Scirjnis Smithii and Lobelia Canbyi. and this after 

 he had failed to satisfy-Boott and Olney of the distinctness of the 

 forms. In explanation of his persistency he tells a friend, " When 

 there seems to be reason for my sentiments, I must express them 

 or die." In a letter to a friend, dated October 15, 1867, he 

 remarks, "At Moosehead Lake I also got OraphepJiorum melicoides 

 and Aqiidium fragrans, heretofore only known as Western plants. 

 It is a comfort to penetrate the hub of the universe and make the 

 natives acquainted with their own plants. One feels good — that 

 is to say, much like a missionary." 



Apart from the beneficent influence the concentration required 

 b}^ good proof-reading had in counteracting insomnia, it was 

 through his chosen work as proof-reader that he has left his 

 impress; especially on botanical literature. He begged his friends, 

 as a privilege, to permit him to read proofs for them. In. the 

 course of such work the contributions of his botanical friends 

 underwent his critical scrutiny; and the authors received the bene- 

 fit of his watchful care. The corrections would often be clothed 

 in dry humor. He once wrote to Dr. Gi'ay on the issuance of a 

 new edition of his Manual, " Have you observed from Gray's 

 Manual that Solidafjo altimma grows only two to seven inches 




1901.] XATUEAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 9 



high ?" The remarkable accuracy that marks the botanical 

 labors of the last quarter of a century is in a great measure due to 

 the impulse given to extra care by Charles E. Smith. The last 

 edition of Leidy's Elementary Treatise on Human Anatomy, 

 although carefully read by the author, would have described a 

 certain process of the brain as the " Hippopotamus " — instead of 

 the Hippocampus — minor, had it not been for Smith's supervision. 

 It is not only in the superior accuracy of the literature of botany 

 and allied studies that science is indebted to our friend. Pie was 

 ever ready ivith encouragement for all botanical enterprises, and 

 especially in the case of younger students. He took an especially 

 warm interest in the establishment of the Ladies' Botanical Club 

 of Syracuse, N. Y. , aiding the society by advice and material. 



The ablest leaders relied on his judgment. Before the appearance 

 of one of the editions of his Manual, Dr. Gray proposed extend- 

 ing the area covered by it. The question was left to Jlr. Smith, 

 who decided adversely. He believed in thorough woik, and held 

 that this was favored by concentration rather than diffusion of 

 effort. In this spirit he commenced a herbarium of the plants 

 growing within fifteen miles of Philadelphia. This collection he 

 bequeathed to the Academy, and it is regarded as a masterpiece of 

 accurate labor. Every locality is exactly noted, and in every case 

 the existence of the plant on the spot was verified by a personal 

 examination, its identity being carefully ascertained. 



The Recording Secretarj' of the Academy, whose official rela- 

 tions brought him into intimate communication with Mr. Smith, 

 remarks in reply to a note of inquiry : 



" Although he was not a frequent visitor to the Academy, he 

 impressed me in the early years of his connection with it as a man 

 of singular directness and personal force. A tone of command 

 and authority, resonant voice, clear enunciation, and erect bearing 

 conveyed the idea of perfect mental poise and a habit of rather 

 directing than of conferring with his associates — but all this with- 

 out a suspicion of arrogance or superciliousness" 



He died on Sunday, the 15th of April, 1900, in the eightieth 

 year of his age. The Academy, proud of its contributors to the 

 advancement of knowledge among mankind, places with them in 

 grateful remembrance the name of Charles Eastwick Smith. 




10 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Ja: 



A REVIEW OF THE GENERA AND SPECIES OF AMERICAN SNAKES, 

 NORTH OF MEXICO. 



BY ARTHUR ERWIN BROWX. 



In recent years, investigation of the lower groups in classifica- 

 tion has largely taken the form of observing and noting the most 

 minute variations, occurring in however small numbei-s. Among 

 snakes, this method has been carried to such an extreme that 

 Prof. Cope's " Characters and Variations of North American 

 Snakes " ' contains the nar:ies of twenty-three species and subspe- 

 cies which were founded upou oue, or at most two specimens each. 



Two propositions, both fundamentally correct, have contributed 

 to this result: first, that a knowledge of the laws under which new 

 forms are developed is to be best gained by a study of variations ; 

 and second, that subspecies are an essential part of classification. 

 As a general ti-uth the first proposition is unassailable, but there 

 appear to be good i-easons why limits should be placed upon its 

 application to the present group and why a cautious valuation 

 should here be made of minor variations. This should be true if 

 it can be shown that unmeaning departures from type are es^ieci- 

 ally common among its members. 



It is a law of organisms that a high degree of instability is 

 associated with degenerative processes. That the serpents, as a 

 whole, are a degenerate group is probable, and while some lines 

 among them have become much specialized, there are large num- 

 bers of small and degraded forms, always highly variable, wliich 

 can be connected with higher types. 



It is, furthermore, a morphological fact that where repetition of 

 parts is the rule, variabilitj', in number at least, is to be looked 

 for.'' Among snakes, generic and specific characters are chiefly 



^Proe. U. S. National Museum, 1892, pp. 589-684. 



' A very simple summary of a long series of observed facts is contained in 

 Bateson's Materials for the Study of Variation, p. 571 (^London, 1894): '' It 

 is perhaps trne that, on the whole, series containing large numbers of undif- 

 ferentiated parts more often show Meristic Variation than series made up of 

 a few parts much differentiated, but throughout the evidence a good many 

 of the latter class are nevertheless to be seen." 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 11 



found in the teeth, in the plates upon the head, and in the number 

 and form of the rows of body scales; all of these are numerous, 

 and variability under the above law is common. 



Color is largely used in specific, and almost wholly in subspecific 

 determination, and this, too, we should expect to find inconstant 

 in a group wliose structure is such that the whole exterior is 

 brought iuto close contact, surface or subterranean, with earth, 

 sometimes swamp and sometimes desert sand, and whose slow 

 metabolism brings such physiological activities as temperature, 

 nutrition and epidermal repair into close dependence upon exter- 

 nal conditions. 



There is, again, a chiss of anomalies not uncommon in this 

 group, such as are shown at times in genera like Coluber or 

 Zamenis, in which the young of some species are spotted or cross- 

 banded, becoming striped when adult. Here, occasionally, more 

 or less of the juvenile pattern is retained, showing through, as it 

 were, the later stage. Examples of such are Coluber guitatus 

 sellatus Cope and C. rosacem Cope. This class of variations is 

 purely physiological, and when occurring in isolated cases, has no 

 more zoological significance than the occasional reteulion to matu- 

 rity of the youthful livery of spots in lions. 



Aside from anomalies, there are characters which are too variable, 

 normally, to be of use except in broad definitions. Form and 

 proportions, both of the whole and of parts, vary considerably; 

 among those wliich change with growth are the relative length of 

 the tail (which also varies with sex), and the reciprocal propor- 

 tions of some head plates; breadth of head and stoutness of body 

 change to an extraordinary degree with nutritive conditions, a 

 fact which can be best learned by observation of snakes kept in 

 captivity.' 



The system of trinomials has added greatly to the facihties for 

 expressing the relationship of transitional forms, but while its 

 value is fully conceded, so also must be the existence of the danger 

 which has attended and not infrequently overtaken it — that the 

 very ease of its methods may lead the systematist to overvalue the 

 importance of individual and insignificant variations. 



" A suggestion as to tlie possible origin of occasional specimens presenting 

 mixed characters, is that anions snakes w liich breed iu captivity there seems 

 to be little or no aversion to^ cross-breeding. This is e.'pecially true of 

 EuUenia and Tropidonoliis, both of which produce young free from-the 

 egg, and breed not infrequently.

The chief purpose of the present paper is to inquire into the 

 nature of these variations, and to determine if possible how far 

 they are promiscuous and witliout meaning, or to what extent they 

 may be beheved to fall within those ideas of jirogressive modifica- 

 tion, without which as a guiding principle, the practice of tax- 

 onomy is mere bypLay. The conception wliich has directed the 

 inquiry, is that a relatively high degree of constancy and isolation 

 is essential to the recognition of a species ; and that variations, to 

 be of subspecific value, must be of such a character as to offer 

 reasonable grounds for the belief that they are stages of change; 

 an important part of such character being that they shall occur in 

 sufficient numbers to constitute centres, so to speak, upon lines 

 leading from established forms. 



The color descriptions have in a large proportion of cases been 

 taken from the living snake; to which it maybe added that in 

 addition to the alcoholic series to which I have had access, includ- 

 ing that of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 

 which now contains the whole private collection of the late Prof. 

 Cope, nearly four thousand living specimens of North American 

 snakes have passed under my observation, in the course of identify- 

 ing the large amount of material in this group which comes into 

 possession of the Zoological Society of Philadelphia. 



The more recent works which treat with modern methods, of the 

 whole field of North American snakes, are the paper of Prof. Cope, 

 above referred to,' and ]Mr. G. A. Boulenger's Catalogue of Snaked 

 in the British Mmeum, (1893-96). 



With neither of these distinguished naturalists am I able to find 

 myself in full accord; the one appearing to me to err in excess of 

 analysis, quite as much as the other does in the opposing method. 



The literature has been so fully worked out by Mr. Boulenger, 



'Since the completion of the present paper (Oo'ober, 1900), the Report of 

 the U. S. Nalional AJusemn for 1898 ha^ appeared, containing Prof. Cope's 

 posthumous work on North American scaled reptiles (Serpentes, pp. 683- 

 1198). I find that few of the conclusions which I bad reached are thereby 

 altered, for the chief additions to his previous paper cf 1892 result from the 

 introduction of cliaracters- drawn from tlie male generative organ. Tliese 

 were not made use of in the present paper, for eximioation of much of 

 Cope's UKiterial, and some further investigations of my own, had satisfied 

 me that much verification and extension remains to be done before tlieir 

 value in generic determination can be established. Sucli changes as I have 

 made have been introdnceii into the text, and references to tlie paper are 

 given as "Cope, Rep. Nat. Mus.," "Cope, I.e.," indicating the previous paper,

Mr. Stejneger has clearly shown the great variability of scutel- 

 lation in these snakes,' and the very wealth of observation which 

 he brings forward destroys the value of the chief character upon 

 which L. orcutti rests;- the presence of an additional loreal. In 

 ad'lition to which is the fact that in the Boidw these plates are so 

 inconstant as to be without classificatory meaning.

In the present genus Mr. Stejneger has again demonstrated the 

 wonhlessness of characters drawn from Ihe scales,' although he 

 prefers to provisionally retain /i/umiea B. and G. The difference 

 of four rows of scales between the type of botke and the minimum 

 of 2-)lumhea is much less than the normal range of variability in 

 almost every known species of Boidw.

The snakes of this genus seem open to every possibility of varia- 

 tion; they exist everywhere in great numbers between the fiftieth 

 and fifteenth degrees of latitude ; many of them are of semi-aquatic 

 habits, and the complexity of their pattern easily runs into irregu- 

 larities, the reckless naming of which has added to the confusion. 

 In The Primary Factors of Organic Evolution, p. 63 (1896), 

 Prof. Cope states that he recognizes forty-niue species and sub- 

 species in this genus. Nevertheless, if the sysleraatist will but 

 remember that heredity does not act with the exact methods of 

 mechanical reproduction, certain fairly definite groups may be 

 made out, to which these anomalies may with some certainty be 

 assigned. 



•In this paper Mr. Stejneger endeavors to substitute for the well-estab- 

 lished Eut(enia B. and G. Fiuiuger's name Thumnophii {Syst. Rept., p. 26, 

 1843), and seeks to remove that author's undefined genera from the class of 

 nomina niida, by the .statement that ''the simple tact that Filzinger ex- 

 pressly indicated the type of the genus at once removes them from that cate- 

 gory." It is true that it does so by rule of the American Ornithologists' 

 Union, but elsewhere, and in my opinion properly, the best asage refuses to 

 sanction these names.

 lateral stripes are of the same color; very dark specimens with 

 such stripes, chiefly from the northern portions of its range, are 

 faireyi B. and G. These have often a slightly longer tail, but the 

 differences are not constant. The usual length of large examples 

 from the Mississippi valley is about 800 mm., of which the tail is 

 from . 33-. 28, but a living specimen lately received by the Zoologi- 

 cal Society from Pecos, Tex., is 1160 mm. long (tail 280). In 

 this the tail is but .24 of the length, being the shortest I have met

Eutsenia megalops Kennicott. 



Proo. Acad. Phila., 1860, 330. 

 Confusion has been introduced into this species by iuaccurate 

 description and identification. Typical megalops is from Arizona; 

 its Mexican representative is macrostemma Kenn. Sundry speci- 

 mens of the latter Prof. Cope described under the name insirj- 

 niai-um, attributing to it markings obscure or wanting, as com- 

 pared with macrostemma ; five specimens in the Academy's collection 

 from the City of ^Mexico, referred by Cope himself to imignianim, 

 do not, however, bear out this statement, and I can see no reason 

 for regarding that form as distinct from macrostemma," which 

 prol)ably does not enter the Uuited States.

from Tucson, Ariz., by Mr. Herbert Brown, and were ascribed by 

 Cope {I. c, p. 651) to msigniarum. They were at the time con- 

 sidered by me to be megalops. They are now in the Academy's 

 collection, and reexamination shows that they do not correspond to 

 Cope's description of the first species, n ir to five examples of that 

 supposed form from Mexico, but they do agree in all resj)ects with 

 Keuuicott's desci-iptiou of megalops, except that the spots are 

 slightly more distinct and the upper labials are variable; one has 

 them 8-8, another 8-9, and tlie third 9-9. In the five macrodemma 

 Iveun. (= iusif/niarum Cope) from Mexico, the largest of which 

 measures 990 mm., I find the tail to be about one-fourth of the 

 length, or longer than in most adult megalops, which reverses the 

 proportions given by Cope; a smaller megalops horn Duck creek. 

 New Mexico, in the Cope collection, 610 mm. long, has the tail 

 about .26, and more ventrals and subcaudals, but is otherwise 

 exactly like my Tucson specimens.

As a rule elegans has 21 rows of scales and 8 labials, but varia- 

 tions to 19 rows and 7 labials are not uncommon, and in one form 



23 rows sometimes appear; oculars 1 (2)-3 (4); temporals 1-2 

 (sometimes 1-1 or 1-3) ; posterior chin shields about equal in 

 length to the anterior; head rather small; eye small or moderate ; 

 size rather smaller than E. siiialis ; tail .19- 2o of length; ven- 

 trals H4-180; subcaudals 53-90. The lateral stripe is on the 

 second and third rows ; the diversity of color is considerable, and 

 is best stated under subspecific heads. E. elegans is a western 

 form, ranging from the central plains to the Pacific coast.

E. vagrans has almost always 21 rows and 8 upper labials; ven- 

 trals 153-172; subcaudals 53-91; the eye is smaller than in 

 elegans and the posterior chin shields either equal the anterior in 

 length or are rather less. Color, greenish yellow or ashy to 

 brown ; the spots are rather small and numerous, they are usually 

 ■distinct and often tend to join together, forming zigzag cross- 

 bands; they usually encroach upon the stripes, which are whitish 

 or yellow; the belly is frequently marbled with slate color, espe- 

 cially in the centre; head bi-own or blackish with parietal spot 

 and nuchal blotches generally present; labials rarely dark bordered 

 and then but narrowly.

 This form was established by Prof. Cope upon a melanistic speci- 

 man of small size, with two preoculai-s and 21-22 rows of scales.

Mr. Van Denburgh has examined a number which liave 2, 3, 

 and occasionally 1 preocular; sometimes 7 labials and 21-23 rows;

Largest of the subspecies; 21 rows of scales; upper labials 8; 

 temporals 1-2 (3); posterior chin shields rather longest; ventrals 

 149-163; subcaudals 53-85. Light brown or ashy; dorsal stripe 

 narrow and not always distinct ; laterals of the same shade, but 

 frequently merged into the belly color; spots distinct and conspicu- 

 ous, sometimes encroaching a little upon the stripes; belly light 

 with a dark spot at the base of each ventral near the end; nuchal 

 and parietal spots present; labials heavily bordered, and a con- 

 spicuous pale post-oral crescent. 



E. nixjrolateris A. Brown was based upon an individual from 

 Tucson, the most striking character of which, apart from obvious 

 abnormalties, was the extension of the preocular upward to meet the 

 frontal. Since then I have examined several luarciana wliich

 large black spots between the dorsal and lateral stripes; anteriorly 

 and on the middle of the body the spots often fuse transverseh% 

 forming zigzag bands; the spots encroach considerably upon the 

 stripes, sometimes breaking through the lateral one, especially 

 anteriorly; a third row of spots on the outer row of scales and the

According to Dr. Coues, this species grows to quite the size of 

 E. sirialis around Fort Whipple, Ariz. 



E. cyrtops'is oeellata Cope Avas founded upon specimens collected 

 by G. W. Maruock at Helotes, Tex., in which the lateral stripe 

 is cut completely through in places by the lower row of dorsal 

 spots. There are two specimens in the Cope collection from the 

 same locality and collector; one in every way corresponds with 

 Kennicott's description of eyrtopsis, the other is oeellata for about 

 four inches behind the head, and eques on the rest of the body. 



It is not easy to reconcile the original description of E. aurata 

 Cope with the type and only specimen, which is simply a well- 

 fattened and stout eques, with the spots obscure, though indicated. 

 The specimen is mutilated and the brown color has disappeared in 

 the preservative fluid, but in every character not dependent upon 

 prominence of the spots, it belongs to the present species.

 1056. 



This subspecies has almost always 19 rows of scales and 7 upper 



labials; oculars 1-3; temporals usually 1-2 (3), occa.sionally 1-1; 



the color is variable, but is usually brown, bluish or green, with 



the three light stripes well defined ; spots rather large and usually

distinct ; top of head dark ; parietal spot present ; labials yellowish 

 or greenish, with darlc borders; ventrals 138-165; subcaudals 

 61-80. Length, 750 to 950 mm., of which the tail is from .20 

 to .2.5. 



Some of the specimens referred by Prof. Cope to E. s. graminea 

 have the stripes more or less distinctly marlied ; these I assign to 

 the present form. 



E. s. semifasciata Cope is based upon a few indi\nduals in 

 which the spots are somewhat confluent anteriorly — a disposition 

 by no means uncommon in many of the species of this genus. 



Specimens in the Academy's collection labeled obscum by Cope 

 plainly show the dorsal spots, although not prominently; similar 

 individuals may be found in almost any lot of E. s. sirtalis col- 

 lected in one locality ; western examples of obsciira are probably 

 referable to E. s. parietnlU. The only thing which appears to me 

 out of the ordinary about the form, is that any one should have 

 thought of giving it a name. 



The basis of E. hutJeri Cope was a specimen from Richmond, 

 Indiana, the special characters of which were: the great width of 

 the lateral stripe, covering three rows of scales ; the black borders 

 of the stripes; the absence of defined spots and of markings on the 

 bead and labials, and the presence of but one temporal in the 

 second row. To these distinctions Mr. Stejneger has added, from 

 a second specimen in the National Museum, that the eye is 

 strikingly small. I have not seen the type specimen, from Rich- 

 mond, but two others (No. 6523, Ac. coll.) from southeastern 

 Indiana, labeled by Cope E. hutlerl, present intermediate charac- 

 ters. In these examples, the lateral stripe nowhere " covei-s " the 

 second, third and fourth rows, being everywhere restricted to tlie 

 lower half of the fourth, and anteriorly, where it most extends on 

 the fourth, it barely covers the upper margin of the second, while 

 on the hinder half of the body it is almost wholly on the second 

 and third. The spots are not entirely absent, though obscure 

 against the dark body color, and in one of the specimens they 

 form narrow broken borders to the stripes, as in many of Cope's 

 obscura; the posterior labials have narrow dark borders, and there 

 is an indistinct parietal spot. Both have two temporals in the 

 second row ; in one the lower is narrow and in contact with the 

 anterior one only by its point; in the other, the lower is much the 




28 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



largest; iu auy event E. s. sirtalis not infrequently has but one 

 second temporal. 



Examination of the type of E. brachydoma Cope leaves little 

 ground for regarding it as anything more than a dwarfed and 

 shortened E. s. sirtalis. The coloi-s ai)pear to have faded; on 

 stretching the skin, indications of the dorsal spots appear, and the 

 ventral spots of sirtalis are not absent, as stated in the description, 

 hut are plainly jjreseut, though small. The body is dispropor- 

 tionately short, as is the mouth, which, instead of reaching back 

 as far as the hinder end of the parietals, ends quite in advance of 

 that point; with which shortening the reduced number of labials is 

 doubtless correlated. 



Hab.— £■. s. sirtalis is found over the United States and southern 

 Canada, east of the great plains, but is chiefly from east of the 

 Mississippi river.

This subspecies has usually 19 rows and 7 labials; occasional 

 examples have 21 rows and the labials are sometimes 8; the color 

 is dark brown, bluish, black or even green ; dorsal stripe distinct 

 and variable in color, white, blue, yellow or red; the laterals are 

 distinct owing to the presence of more or less of the dark body 

 color on the outer rows and ends of the ventrals ; the upper row of 

 spots commonly fuses into a longitudinal black stripe, with which 

 the lower row sometimes connects above; the skin on the sides- is 

 bright red, sometimes extending on to the scales so that the sides 

 appear to have a denticulated pattern of black and red. This is 

 often seen in living snakes only when the scales are stretched apart, 

 but in alcoholic specimens the spaces between the lower row of spots 

 seem to fade rapidly to white, and the denticulated pattern is then 

 very distinct. The belly is yellow, green or bluish slate, and the 

 spots near the ends, though small, are plainly to be seen at the 

 base of each ventral; top of head olive or reddish yellow; an 

 occasional labial with a narrow dark margin. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELnilA. 29 



E. s. tetraimnia Cope was founded upou S] ecimeus which had 

 beeu many years in alcohol. One in the Academy's collection 

 (No. 6085) from Paget Sound, formerly known as E. eoncinna, 

 seems to have had the red lateral spaces formed into a longitudinal 

 stripe, extinguishing the upper portion of the lower row of spots. 

 A small snake in the same jar, of the same date and locality, is au 

 ordinary pnrietalia. 



Considering the amount of variability in the joining of the spots 

 in parletalis, and also the uncertain way in which the red pigment 

 dissolves in alcohol, I am not disposed to attach much importance 

 to slight differences in these very old specimens. 



E. dorsalis B. and G. has the upper black dorsal stripe some- 

 what narrower than is usual in those examples of parietalis in 

 which the spots fuse into a stripe. 



E. ordinoides B. and G. is said to have the sides chestnut in 

 life, instead of bright red, but tliis difference is trivial and old 

 alcoholic sjiecimens are distinguishable only when they have 21 

 rows of scales and 8 labials ; but as ordinoides and parietalis vary 

 into each other in scutelhition, I see no good reason for separating 

 them, or for assigning the former to E. elegans, as is done by Cope. 



Whatever may or may not have been infernalis Blainville, I 

 have never seen a living specimen which could be referred with 

 certainty to infernalis B. and G. or Cope, and I am persuaded 

 that those so called belong in part to the present form and in part 

 to E. elegans. 



The dimensions of parietalis are about as in E. s. ■nrtalis.

 1-1 or 1-2 ; upper labials usually 7, but sometimes 6 or 8 ; olive, 

 greenish or blackish brown, generally with three light stripes; 

 these are variable and sometimes absent ; the three rows of spots 

 are hardly to be seen in dark specimens; belly yellowish, greenish 

 or dark slate; head dark, with a parietal spot; labials yellower 

 olive, sometimes narrowly bordered; ventrals 139-152; sub- 

 caudals 52-77. Total length of one specimen 724 mm. (tail 

 164); of another 723 mm. (tail 138). ^Nine specimens from 

 Washington and British Columbia, collected by Samuel N. 

 Rhoads, have 17 rows of scales; nearly all have 7 labials; one 

 has them 7-8, and one has 8; the preoculars are 1, 2 or 3, with 2, 

 3 or 4 postoculars. In all the color is dark brown or black, with 

 the spots barely visible and the lateral stripe indistinct. Indi- 

 viduals with 19 rows and 7 labials so closely resemble some forms 

 of parietalls, and in fact some Eastern E. s. sirtalis, that I cannot 

 regard it as more than a subspecies. 



In E. infernalis vidua Cope has merely redescribed two of 

 Kennicott's original specimens of E. atrata, although he does not 

 mention the fact, while referring to the resemblance. One of 

 Kennicott's specimens (No. 6359 Ac. coll. ; original number 970), 

 marked vidua by Cope, better accords with the iirst description 

 than with the later one. It has 19 rows at a point about three 

 inches behind the head, where the number rarely reaches a maxi- 

 mum, but on the rest of the body it has 17 as stated by Kenni- 

 cott;'^ upper labials 8; oculars 1-3; temporals 1-2; ventrals 155; 

 subcaudak 65; length 622 mm. (tail 138), or .22 of the length, 

 being considerably shorter than the proportion given by Cope. A 

 second specimen (No. 6584 Ac. coll.), also from San Francisco, 

 has the dorsal stripe somewhat narrower ; spots obscure, but visible 



'- Curiously enough, Cope in his last paper, p. 1059, refers to this irregu- 

 larity in the number of rows as being sometimes found in leptocephala.

against the dark body color, and has the belly rather lighter, with 

 clear indications of a lateral stripe on the second and third rows ; 

 veutrals 143; subcaudals 63; length 440 mm. (tail 108, or .245 

 of the length). In one the labials are dark lead color, in the 

 other yellowish green, both with traces of narrow dark borders; 

 the chin shields are not subequal in these specimens, but the hinder 

 are noticeal)ly the longest, as in most leptocephald, and the eye is 

 small, as in that form. Mr. Van Denburgh refers vidua to elegans, 

 but the totality of characters in the two which I have examined 

 comples me to regard them as leplocephaln, to which, in fact. Cope 

 himself has already referred atnda, of which vidua in no event 

 could be more than a synonym.

Tropidonotus compressioaudus Kennicott. 

 Proc. Acad. Phila., 1860, .335. 



Size moderate; tail somewhat compressed; scales in 19 or 21 

 rows, very occasionally 23; oculars 1-3 (2); temporals 1-3 (2); 

 upper labials 8. The pattern in this species is not disi;inct, and is 

 best seen in the young. The body color is greenish olive, with a 

 dorsal row of black spots and a smaller series on each side. The 

 spots are confused and irregular, the laterals being sometimes oppo- 

 site the dorsals and sometimes alternating with them ; they tend to 

 fuse together, forming cross-bands, which when they alternate, are 

 zigzag. The anterior spots in many specimens merge lengthwise 

 into more or less distinct stripes on the neck, which at times extend 

 some distance on the body. The belly is yellowish or ashy, com- 

 monly blotched with black, more heavily posteriorly; anteriorly 

 each ventral is margined with black, leaving a transverse elliptical 

 yellow mark in the centre, with sometimes a row of similarly 

 colored small spots on each end. Top of the head greenish olive, 

 often with an elongated black blotch on the frontal and parietals; 

 labials yellow, more or less mai'giued with black.

In this form the spots join to form more or less distinct cross- 

 bands, some thirty-five to forty on the body ; these are frequently 

 obscure, especially in adult;;; the neck stripes occasionally extend 

 some distance toward the tail. The body color is frequently pale 

 yellow, more or less suffused with the reddish tinge common in 

 many species of this genus. The whole pattern is indefinite and 

 hardly any two specimens are alike ; upon these trivial ditlcrences 

 the forms given in the synonymy have been based.

Tropidonotus sipedon I-- 



Coluber sipedon L., Syst. Nat., Ed. X, 219 (1758).

 labials 8 (occ. 9); oculars 1-3 (2); temporals 1-3 ; veutrals 125- 

 155;_subcaudals 59-82. 



In this species the color is brown, yellowish or red above, with 

 darker transverse bands or spots on the back, or botli in cotiibina- 

 tion; the belly is yellowish, either spotted or unmarked. The 

 pattern is distinct in the young, but the body color becomes dark 

 in old specimens, until the markings are often wholly obliterated. 

 Three well-marked color forms may be distinguished, of which 

 1. s. sipedon is the common "water snake" of the Eastern 

 Middle States; T. s. Jasciatwi of the Southern and Gulf States, 

 and 1. s. traiisversas seems to be restricted to the western part of 

 the lower Mississippi valley.

Size large; body stout; scales in 2H rows (raiely 25); upper 

 labials 8; oculars 1-3 (2); temporals 1-3; veutrals 125-155; 

 subcaudals 60-82. 



Yellowish, yellowish red, or browu above, with from twenty to 

 thirty darker transverse bands ou the back, narrowing on the sides, 

 and sometimes red spots on the sides; sometimes the bands are more 

 or less broken posteriorly; belly whitish yellow or salmon color, 

 blotched with yellow, red or black ; very often each ventral is mar- 

 gined all around with the darker shade; top of the head uniformly 

 dark, generally olive; an oblique dark streak behind the orbit; 

 labials margined with dark brown. Old specimens become very 

 dark. A large one from Georgia, now living in the Zoological 

 Gardens, is sooty black with traces of red markings on the flanks; 

 in this specimen the posterior third of the belly is almost wholly 

 black. Another from Florida has the body color brick red on 

 the back, becoming almost vermilion on the sides, the cross-bands 

 being reddish with a mixture of olive; the ventrals are yellow or 

 orange, mostly bordered all around with darker orange. This 

 merely fortuitous phase h pictieventris Cope." 



A young specimen, now in the Academy's collection, bred in 

 the Zoological Gardens from a typical fasciatus, shows at the age 

 of one day, transverse bands, posteriorly much broken up into 

 spots. With the darkening and consequent obscurity of color, 

 especially along the dorsal area, which results from age, this speci- 

 men would develop the pattern attributed to pleiiralis Cope. 



I have no knowledge of small individuals of erythrogaster Shaw, 

 and there is not the least doubt in my mind that this form is again 

 the result of darkening with age of the red specimens of fasciatus 

 described above; although 't may be that some northern examples 

 should be referred to T. s. sipedon. 



The largest of this subspecies which I have seen, measured 1270 

 mm. (tail 300). 



Ilab. — Virginia to Florida aud west to Texas. 



" This identification is given on the authority of Prof. Cope, who declared 

 that this specimen belonged to his new subspecies.

 Rep. Nat. Mus., 969 ; T.fascirftiis (part) Boul., I. c, I, 242. 



Size moderate; almost invariaWy 2.'5 rows and 8 upper labials; 

 old specimens sometimes much resemble some phases of T. s. fasci- 

 atus, but as a rule the body is less stout. When clear enough to 

 be distinguished, the pattern consists of a series of large brown 

 dorsal spots, separated by very narrow light interspaces; the dorsal 

 alternates with a series of lateral spots separated by light intervals 

 as long as or longer than themselves. Anteriorly, the lateral 

 spots are often obscure or wanting. In old dark individuals, the 

 general aspect is that of a dark-brown snake crossed on the middle 

 of the back by narrow light lines, about half a scale wide, mar- 

 gined with black. The ventrals are spotted, but less heavily 

 than in fascUdus. Top of the head brown ; there is usually no 

 post-ocular stripe, but when the general color is light, it is some- 

 times indicated. Ventrals 130-150; subcaudals 59-80. Length

 labials 8; veutrals 141-150; subcaudals 57-78. 



Reddish browu, occasionally pale yellowish brown, darker on 

 the back; a dorsal series of 35^-40 black blotches, six or seven 

 scales wide and two or three long, separated by rather longer inter- 

 spaces; on each side an alternating series of vertical rectaugular 

 blotches, each of which is connected by a black oblique bar from 

 its upper corners to the contiguous lower corners of the dorsal spots.

This species was included by Mr. Boulenger in his comprehensive 

 genus Tropidoiiohts, but the smooth body scales and absence of 

 scale pits, together with the wide difference in form and color pat- 

 tern, appear to me to warrant generic separation. I have observed 

 that in captivity these little snakes are fond of hiding under stones 

 or bark in moist soil, and this habit is confirmed by Mr. Lcennberg." 

 On the whole, I suspect that pygcca is a degenerating Tropidonotus 

 in process of acquiring subterranean habits. It is pos«ible that the 

 light line on the dorsal scales may indicate the former presence of 

 keels, but lately lost.

 pents being accepted for publication in the same month. Both genera were 

 established upon S. dekayi, but as the definition given by Baird and Girard

 ever, has the scales frequently in an odd number ; two specimens from 

 Trinidad, formerly in the Zoological Garden, had 15 and 17 rows respectively

Reliable specific characters, drawn from the scutellation, are want- 

 ing in the American species of Coluber. The proportions of the 

 frontal and parietal plates, upon which some stress has been laid, 

 are so variable with age and in individuals, that little importance 

 can be attached to them singly; except that in vulpinus, and still 

 more in Undheimeri, the anterior border of the frontal is wide and 

 the lateral angles are obtuse, so that the plate is often subtrian- 

 gular. Cope divides the species into sections, according to the 

 number of anterior temporals, but I find them by no means con- 

 stant enough to serve that purpose. The number of ventrals and 

 subcaudals is not diagnostic, the limits of variability overlapping 

 in most species; although quadrivittatus, a long-tailed species, has 

 the lai-gest number of subcaudals, and vulpinus, which is short 

 and thick, has the least. There are fairly constant difierences in 

 pattern and color, and upon these, with a totality of other charac- 

 ters, they may be divided with some certainty.

 labials, five touching anterior chin shields; scales usually in 

 27 rows (rarely 29), very slightly keeled on about five rows; 

 ventrals 215-240; subcaudals 61-79. Length 1200 ram. (tail 

 190). 



Light red, paler on the sides: dorsal blotches darker red with 

 black borders and a narrow margin of dark red outside of the 

 black ; the dorsal spots reach to about the seventh row of scales ; 

 below these there is a second alternating series of smaller spots, 

 which sometimes have a tendency to run together longitudinally, 

 and a third series on the ends of the ventrals and the two outer 

 rows. In some specimens the dorsal spots are wider, and the 

 laterals are mostly absent or form an indistinct longitudinal 

 stripe; this is C. y. sellatus Cope, the type specimens of which had 

 29 rows of scales, but a very similar specimen in my own collec- 

 tion from Lake Kerr, Florida, has but 27. The color beneath is 

 yellowish white, with quadrangular blotches of black on the outer 

 ends of the ventrals. The head is usually, but not always, banded 

 above.

 trals 232-250; subcaudals 86-105 (one examined by me has the 

 abnormally small number of 66). 



Body color yellow or buff, sometimes faintly greenish, with four 

 lontritudinal stripes of dark brown ; the laterals on the fourth aud 

 part of the third and fifth, and the upper ones on the eleventh and

part of the tenth and twelfth row?. In some ?pecimens the body- 

 color is dark chestnut. Underneath and on top of head yellow, 

 unmarked. The young in this species are spotted, the spots at 

 subsequent stages fusing into stripes. One specimen 1720 mm. long, 

 from Florida, now living in the Zoological Gardens, shows ihese 

 spots quite plainly outlined on the back, forty-one in number from 

 head to vent, with the stripes running across them. There are also 

 faint remains of lateral spots. This mixture of immature and adult 

 characters probably accounts for C. rosaceii.3 Cope. Reaches a

Color black above, brownisli iu the yoimg; the dorsal spots are 

 inJistiuctly outliued, but not enough, as a rule, to make them out 

 except iu young or newly-shed individuals. In some specimens 

 the skin on the sides is more or less red. The belly is usually 

 slaty black behind, yellow anteriorly, more or less maculated with 

 black blotches ; throat and chin white ; labials yellow, margined 

 with black. A living specimen from Pennsylvania, 1080 mm. 

 long, shows thirty indistinct dorsal spots, and has considerable red 

 skin on the flanks, which shows between but does not invade the

 subcaudals 76-81. 



Yellowish above with a dorsal series of dark lead-colored spots, 

 five or sis scales long and thirteen to fifteen wide, the iuterspaces 

 of the body color are about two scales long and many of the scales 

 have lead -colored centres; another series of elongated blotches on 

 the third to the seventh row; ventrals with dark spots on the 

 ends and outer scale rows, at intervals of several scales, otherwise 

 yellowish white, often clouded posteriorly. The bases and margins 

 of many scales in the light iuterspaces are rusty red in every living 

 specimen that I have seen; this fades rapidly iu alcohol. Top of 

 head is uniform lead color without bands. The eye is rather 

 large. Length 1525 mm. (tail 230). 



Hab.— Texas. 



The distinctness of the color pattern at all ages, the red on the 

 scales of the flanks, the slight but, as it appears to me, very gen- 

 eral difference in the shape of the frontal, with an apparently

circumscribed geographical range, are quite enough, in myoijiuion, 

 to compel recognition of this subspecies.

 no distinct head bauds in adults. 



Hab. — From Virginia to Florida, west to Missouri and Texas. 



1 am not able to satisfy myself that spiloides Dum. and Bib. and 

 Iwtns B. and G. are distinct from the present form ; Cope, indeed, 

 places them in three diflferent sections of Coluber, assigning a 

 diflferent number of anterior temporals to each — one to confinis, two 

 to spiloides and three to hetus. But the single specimen in his own 

 collection, considered by him to be confinis, has two, which is the 

 normal number; while the figures of Iwlus given by Baird in 

 Marcy's Report of the Red River Exp., PI. VI, and Pac. R. R. 

 Survey, PI. XXX, fig. 53, both represent that species as also 

 having two. (The three temporals in Cope's fig. 196 (p. 851)' 

 have every appeai-ance of abnormality.) The difference in pattern 

 stated in the description of ketus is probably accounted for by the 

 youih of the type, which is but 460 mm. long, while the occur- 

 rence of 25 rows, as in spiloides, is quite n:>rmal, and 29, as in 

 ketus, would not be startling in C. o. confinis.

Maxillary teeth smooth, equal; rostral extended behind; one 

 loreal; one preocular with sometimes a small one beneath; two 

 nasals; two internasals; four to .=ix prefrontals; scales keeled with 

 pits in 29-35 rows; anal entire; size large; head moderately 

 distinct. 



Hab. — North America and Mexico. 



The species of Pityophis within ihe United States may be deter- 

 mined upon the following grounds : P. melanoleucus, from the 

 eastern States, has a high rostral, in most cases reaching the pre- 

 frontals, and has large dorsal spots, 26-cio in number, on the body ; 

 usually about the four outer rows of scales are smooth. 



P. sayi, from west of the ^Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains, 

 has the rostral less high, usually reaching about two-thirds of the 

 distance to the prefrontals, and has smaller spots, 40-60, on the 

 body, and usually seven or eight smooth rows of scales. 



P. catenifer, from the Pacific coast, west of the Sierra Nevada, 

 has a low rostral, usually not penetrating between the internasals, 

 and agrees generally in pattern with sayi. 



These characters of the rostral and the dorsal spots are fairly 

 constant, but examination of a considerable number of specimens 

 from the region of the Great Basin leaves no doubt in my mind 

 that the form found there intergrades with both catenifer and sayi, 

 and reduces them to subspecies. The two species recognized here 

 may in almost every case be distinguished by color characters 

 aloue: 



Rostral high; no head bands; sjiots large and few, 



1. P. mekinoleucui. 

 Rostral lower; head bands distinct; spots small and many, 



2. P. caienijer. 



Pityophis catenifer Blainville. 



Coluber catenifer Bl., Nouv. Ann. du Mus., IV, 290, PI. 24, fig. 2 

 (1835). 



In this species the rostral varies from low and broad to high and 

 narrow above, penetrating sometimes between the internasals but 

 not reaching the prefrontal?; prefrontals usually four, but occa-

sionally sis ; preucuiar 1, with occasionally a small additional one 

 below; three post-oculars ; temporals 3-4 (5); upper labials 8 or 

 9; scales in 27-35 rows, from three to twelve outer rows smooth; 

 the dorsal spots are quite small and range from 40-70 in number 

 on the body ; three series of more or less defined spots on the sides ; 

 the head is transversely banded between the orbits, from the orbit 

 vertically downward on the labials, and obliquely from the post- 

 oculars to the angle of the mouth ; ventrals 205-243 ; subcaudals 

 50-72. 



The three subspecies may usually be distinguished by the shape 

 of the rostral : 



Rostral low and broad, 1. P. c. catenifer. 



Rostral higher, 2. P. c. hellona. 



Rostral highest, S. P. c. sctyi.

 67; P. catenifer Van Den., I. c, 195. 



In this Pacific coast form the rostral is lowest of all and reaches, 

 ■without penetrating, the iuteruasals; upper labials 8 or 9; tem- 

 porals 2 (3)-4; scales in 29-35 rows, none strongly keeled and 

 from four to eleven smooth. Usually there are not more than 

 five smooth rows, but a large specimen from Fort Tejon, Cal. 

 (No. 3,800, Academy coll.), has eleven smooth on each side. 

 Very little reliance can be placed, however, on the number of 

 smooth rows in any of the species of Pltij(iplu!>, as they not infre- 

 quently vary in different parts of the same individual. Ventrals 

 205-230; subcaudals 50-70. 



Ground color yellowish or brownish ; there are nsually 50-70 

 dorsal spots on the body, but sometimes these are as few as 3G, 

 from 15-21 on the tail; anteriorly the spots are black, becoming 

 brownish toward the tail; belly yellowish, with a series of dark 

 spots on the ends of the ventrals and sometimes another ill-defined 

 series on the middle; the head bands are distinct. Length 1,900 

 mm. (tail 315). 



Hab. — Pacific coast west of the Sierra Nevada.

This form appears to be found through the so-called Great 

 Basin, from Arizona northward to Utah and Xevada. The rostral 

 is almost always higher than in P. c. catenifer, but less so than in 

 P. c. sayi ; it commonly penetrates between the iuteruasals about 

 one-third of their length. No! 3,978 Academy collection, from 

 Ogden, Utah, has the rostral barely touching the internasals, as in 

 P. c. catenifer, and has a maximum of six rows of smooth scales. 

 No. 3,782, from Owens' Valley, Cal., has the rostral penetrating 

 further, fully one-third, and has three rows of smooth scales. 

 No. 10,378, from Salt Lake, has the rostral as in No. 3,782. 

 This specimen, 1,040 mm. long, was taken in 1899, and has 

 sixty-four spots on the body, with seventeen on the tail; 31 rows 

 of scales, of which four are smooth; the colors are very distinct, 

 and on the posterior two-thirds of the body the light interspaces 

 are pink. Jlr. Stejneger {I. c.) has applied the na.me desert icola 

 to this form, on the ground that bellona B. and G. is a synonym 

 of sayi. It is probably true that the type of bellona — now lost — 

 belonged to the ijlains form, but, as Prof. Cope points out, Baird's 

 plate in the Pacific R. R. Survey represents the one now under 

 consideration. In such a case, when there is a question as to abso- 

 lute invalidity, I see no good reason for supf lanting an old and 

 well-known name by a new one. The intensity of color, including 

 the pink tinge on the hinder half of the body, is hardly sufficient 

 for subspecific distinction, for even if it should be constant — and 

 some examples which have been four years in alcohol do not show 

 it— it is of no great importance, and Florida specimens of P. 

 melanoleucwi would be quite as well entitled to separation on 

 account of their rufous tints. The size of this form seems to be 

 about as in P. e. catenifer. 



Hab. — California east of the Sierra Nevada; Utah and Nevada 

 south to Arizona and New Mexico.

The rostral is narrow above and penetrates the internasals about 

 two-thirds of tlieir length ; an inferior preocular is frequently 

 present; upper labials 8 or 9 ; scales in 27-33 rows, usually five 

 to nine smooth; the dorsal spots are larger and usually fewer in 

 number than in the other forms of catenifer, but an occasional 

 specimen exhibits an equally large number. There are sometimes 

 as few as forty, but two living specimens in my possession show 

 respectively fifty-three and sixty-nine; ventrals 215-230; sub- 

 caudals 50-62. 



The body color is yellowish or reddish lirown ; the spots are 

 black anteriorly and more or less blackish brown posteriorly; the 

 belly is yellowish, with a small dark blotch on the end of each 

 alternate ventral; labials margined with dark brown; the head 

 bauds are usually distinct, but in two large specimens from Pecos, 

 Tex., they are almost obsolete. The largest I have measured is 

 1,990 mm. (tail 190); greatest circumference 210 mm. This 

 species doubtless reaches a length of over two metres. 



Hab. — The range is very extensive: from Canada to Mexico, 



between the Mississippi river and the Rocky Mountains. It has 



also been taken in Illinois. No. 4,689 Academy collection, from 



Vernon, Briti.sh Columbia, is not distinguishable from it; in fact, 



in this specimen the posterior extension of the rostral approaches 



melanoleucus.

In the eastern form the rostral reaches the extreme of elevation, 

 in many cases completely separatiug the internasals and being iu 

 contact with the prefrontals; usually four prefrontals; oculars 1-3, 

 sometimes a small sub-preocular; temporals small, 4 (3)-5; upper 

 labials 8; scales in from 27-33 rows, usually 27 or 29, of which 

 in most cases four to seven are smooth (in a large specimen from 

 New Jersey there are seven smooth rows anteriorly and four on 

 the hinder part of the bodv). 




56 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JilU., 



Body color whitish oi buff, lighter on the sides. The dorsal 

 spots are larger than in cateiiifer, and range from 25-35 on the 

 body and 5-8 on the tail; they are blackish brown, more or less 

 marked with paler brown on their centres; two or three series of 

 rather indistinct spots on the sides; belly ivory white, with brown 

 spots on the ends of the ventrals at intervals of about four 

 scales. There are no distinct head bands in adults, though they 

 are shown by the young. The top of the head is yellow, each 

 plate more or less marked by pale brown; labials margined with 

 brown. Of nearly one hundred Florida .specimens which I have 

 seen, all were uniformly tinged with rusty brown over the whole 

 upper surface. Ventrals 210-230; subcaudals 52-65. The largest 

 which I have measured was 1,837 mm. long (tail 185). 



Hab. — New Jersey to Ohio, and south to the Gulf coast; most 

 common along the seacoast.

Maxillary teeth smooth, increasing gradually behind, with some- 

 times a slight interspace ; one loreal ; two preocidars, the lower 

 very small; two nasals; two internasals; scales smooth or faintly 

 keeled, with pits; anal divided; body long and slender; head 

 distinct. 



Hab. — Europe, Asia and North America. 



The North American species (= B(ucanlmn B. and G. ) have a 

 purely syncranterian dentition and smooth scales. Tlie forms 

 inhabiting the southern tier of states are puzzling in the extreme. 

 To reach conclusions which shall at least have the merit of con- 

 sistency, the changes which take place with growth in the best- 

 known species from the eastern Gulf States, Z. /. flagellum, must 

 be considered. Here the young are pale brownish with narrow, 

 darker cross-bands on the whole upper surface; an occasional 

 specimen also shows indistinct wider cross-bands anteriorly. The 

 outer four or five rows of scales (rather more anteriorly) have 

 pale edges, leaving a narrow dark line on the centre of each scale, 

 giving the appearance of four or five narrow broken stripes 

 on the sides. In eastern examples these markings usually disap- 

 pear with age, although the cross-bands occasionally persist. From 

 Texas westward there are forms in which the cross-bands have 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 57 



become fixed, and others ia which more or less of the lateral 

 stripes have become likewise permanent, and even more distinct, 

 although in these last the narrow cross-bands have disappeared in 

 the young, which are striped. It must also be borne in mind that 

 there is a marked inequality in the color intensity of all the 

 American species, as there is a tendency for the color to remain 

 pale on the hinder half of the body, involving the disappearance 

 of the pattern. This is the case even in the uniformly colored 

 species, as Z. c. eon-'ifrictor, in which the change to the light colors 

 of western specimens first shows on the tail, and Z. f. piceits, in 

 which the bases of the scales posteriorly are pale. 



The relative proportions in width of the hinder part of the 

 frontal and supraocular plates are also growth characters and 

 therefore irregular, and in my belief will bear only a small part of 

 the weight which has been placed upon them. 



Duly considering the various combinations in adults, of these 

 early characters, I conclude that the Z. fingellmn group extends 

 from Florida to California, with two forms in addition to the 

 typical one which demand recognition; these arc Z. /. ^;tcc«s and 

 Z. f. frenatus. The striped forms, extending from Texas to Cali- 

 fornia, have become differentiated to the point of wider separation, 

 and seem to me to fall into two species: Z. taiiiatus (with a sub- 

 species Z. t. ornatm) and Z. lateralis. Z. schotti B. and G. and 

 Z. semilineatus Cope, I can regard only as fortuitous examples of 

 Ueniatns and lateralis respectively. 



This is almost a complete reversal of the views held by Prof, 

 ('ope, but the facts appear to me to indicate that the subspecies 

 here admitted are tending in the direction of fixed characters, 

 while those rejected are no more than instances of incomplete 

 development.

Zamenis constrictor L. 



Coluber constrictor L., Syst. Nat., Eil. X, 216 (1758). 



Body slender with long tail; head scales normal; frontal rather 

 more than half the width of supraoculars, behind; two nasals; 

 one loreal; oculars 2-2; temporals 2-2 ; upper labials 7 (rarely 

 8); scales in 17 rows; ventrals 164-189; subcaudals 79-110. 



Length 1,525 mm. (tail one-fourth to one-fifth). 



Eastern specimens are black above and slate color beneath ; west 

 of the Mississippi they are usually green or olive above, yellow 

 beneath. There are transitional stages between these extremes and 

 they are good subspecies : 



Size larger; black above, slate color beneath, 1. Z. c. constrictor. 

 Size smaller; green or olive above; yellow beneath, 



2. Z. c. flavivenlrls.

Examples fi-om the east are lustrous black above; belly slate 

 color; chin and throat white. One specimen from Pennsylvania 

 now living in the Zoological Gardens presents the curious anomaly 

 of a distinctly brown snout. In the western portion of its range 

 it becomes bluish or olive black and the belly gets lighter. The 

 young are unlike the adults, being gray, spotted or cross-banded 

 with darker. Ventrals 175-189; subcaudals 83-110. The length 

 of the largest I have seen was 1,470 ram. (tail 310). 



Hab. — United States east of the central plains; northern 

 Mexico.

 Cope, Rep. Nat. Mus., 791 ; B. c. vetiistum Van Den., I. c, 183 ; Z. 

 stejnegerianus Cope, Rep. Nat. Mus., 797. 



Size rather smaller and body more slender than in B. c. con- 

 strictor; the scutellation is similar, but an eighth labial is more 

 frequently present ; ventrals 164-188; subcaudals 79-95. 



Length about 1,100 mm. (tail rather more than one-fourth). 

 In examples from the plains the color is often bright green above 

 and bright yellow underneath; chin and throat paler yellow; such 

 specimens are usual in Kansas and Oklahoma. Westward and on 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 59 



the Pacific coast the color darkens to olive, more or less yellowish 

 green beneath. 



I see uo reason for regarding Z. stejnegerianus Cope as anything 

 more than the present subspecies with eight labials. The sub- 

 division of the loreal is so obviously abnormal that it is not worth 

 considering. The type and only specimen came from southeastern 

 Texas.

This species has the scutellatiou of Z. constrictor, but the labials 

 are 8 ; the frontal has half the width of the supraoculars behind ; 

 the muzzle is more elevated and the tail is longer; ventrals 184- 

 210; subcaudala 80-112. 



The young are cross-banded, and this pattern persists in some 

 cases until they are grown.

 184-210; subcaudals 80-112. 



Reaches an extreme length of 1,800 mm. (tail 385 to 430). In 

 adults the head and anterior portion of the body is blackish brown, 

 then dark brown back to the posterior half or third of the body, 

 which is pale yellowish brown, each scale with a darker basal mar- 

 gin ; belly yellowish posteriorly, black or brown under the dark 

 anterior portion, somewhat spotted behind; sometimes each ven- 

 tral is margined with brown ; generally a light spot on the pre- 

 ocular? ; chin and throat white, more or less spotted with brown. 



The young have narrow cross-bands on the body which are 

 sometimes retained to maturity. A Florida specimen 1,780- mm. 




60 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



long, now living iu the Zoological Gardens, shows these bands on 

 the pale posterior portion of the body after shedding. Another, 

 also from Florida, has indistinct wide cross-bands as in Z. t. 

 ornatus. 



Examples from west of the Mississippi are often of jialer colors, 

 with dark heads, and adults sometimes show the wide cross-bands 

 and even indications of the light lateral stripes of ornatus. 



I was formerly of the opinion that testaceum Say should be 

 admitted as a pale desert form, but examination of a considerable 

 number of living specimens from central Texas and westward, 

 satisfy me that occasional individuals only, show its extreme pale- 

 ness.

Mr. Stejneger has proposed to regard as a subspecies the form 

 of Z. flmjeUum from Arizona and westward with permanent cross- 

 bands on the anterior portion of the body. This is the retention 

 of a juvenile character which was referred to uader the preceding 

 subspecies, and which would doubtless be more evident in eastern 

 specimens, were it not for the dark color which j)ervades those parts 

 in the adult; but there is so strong a disposition for this character 

 to become permanent iu the far west, that JNIr. Stejneger is prob- 

 ably right iu recognizing ihe form. 



The following description is taken from a beautiful living speci- 

 men lately received from Yuma, Ariz., through the kindness of 

 Mr. Herbert Brown : 



17 rows of scales; 8 upper labials; ventrals 193; sub-caudals 

 100; length 1,400 mm. (tail 345). Body color rather pale brown 

 extending to the ventrals; most of the scales are darker at the 

 tip and faintly edged with pink; the lower edge of the outer 

 row and the adjacent ends of the ventrals are whitish, forming an 

 indistinct line, which is n~ore obvious anteriorly and disappears 

 before reaching the tail; the three or four outer rows are faintly 

 darker in the centre, suggesting the dark lateral stripes of Z. 

 Ueniatm. The anterior fourth of the body is crossed by indistinct 

 bands, one and a lialf to two scales wide; top of head rather 

 darker brown, with a liglit spot on the pre- and post-oculars; 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADEIJ'HIA. 61 



indications of a light line from the nostril to the eye ; upper 

 labials yellow on the lower margin, more broadly behind; belly 

 yellowisii, much clouded with piuk, which tends to form longitu- 

 dinal stripes iu front; throat and chin yellow, spotted with dark 

 brown. 



Hab. — Arizona, Nevada, Utah and southern California.

 Am. Fauna, No. 7, 209. 



The type specimen, from Camp Grant, Arizona, has 19 rows of 

 scales; 17 is probably the u.sual number, as ]\rr. Stejueger mentions 

 one with that number, which agrees with a living example received 

 at the Zoological Gardens in 1894 from Tucson; this speci- 

 men had 8 upper labials on one side and 9 on the other. The 

 color iu life was a rich dark brown wiih a purplish tinge, poste- 

 riorly most of the scales were light brown at the base; the belly was 

 pink slightly spotted with dusky, which increased anteriorly until 

 the throat was nearly black ; there was a little pink on the pre- 

 oculars and lower labials; rest of head very dark. The pink 

 rapidly faded to yellow in alcohol. This specimen is now in the 

 Academy's collection. Ventrals 190; subcaudals 108; length 

 1,650 mm. (tail 380). Cope's specimen measured 1,263 mm. and 

 the tail was proportionately longer (355 mm).

usually another on the edge of the ventrals; most of the scales 

 on the rest of the dorsal region have dark centres; yellowish 

 beneath, without spots except sometimes on the throat; top of head 

 dark: an in<listinct light line from the nostril to the eye; a light 

 spot on both pre- and post-oculars; labials yellow, a little spotted. 



I am unable to formulate a valid distinction between Z. schotti. 

 B. and G. and this species ; the stripes appear not to run as far 

 back, but they are variable in this respect in Z. t. teeniatus, and 

 their disappearance on the tail is doubtless a result of the fading 

 out of color (or, more correctly, the failure to develop it) poste- 

 riorly, which is common in the genus. No. 5,369 Academy coll. 

 (old number 1,973), labeled sclwtti, from the Rio Grande, appears 

 to be one of Schott's original specimens, and almost exactly cor- 

 responds to No. 5,363, a kcniatm from Utah, of about the same 

 date. But it must be admitted that no great reliance can be placed 

 upon color characters in specimens which have been for so many 

 years in spirits.

enlarged shield behind the parietals; the tail is shorter; the dorsal 

 spots are more numerous and thei-e are two series of irregular 

 lateral s])ots. The type specimen in the Academy's collection is 

 from northern Lower California, and there is a second in the 

 National Museum from La Paz. A third, which has just reached 

 me from Mr. Herbert Brown, collected by him at Yuma, Ariz., 

 for the first time establishes the species within the United States. 

 This specimen differs from the type in that the rosti-al penetrates 

 between the prefrontals as in P. broivni; there is but one subocu- 

 lar, and but two post-oculars on one side; there are four temporals; 

 the tail is rather longer, and the spots are more numerous, being

■*Prof.*Cope removes all the species included here in Gontia, except G. 

 mitis, to Chionactis Cope, on account of their pos-session of a shallow external 

 groove on the posterior maxillary tooth. This is probably the same noted 

 by Dr. Giinther as a distinct elongated pit at the base of the hinder teeth in 

 large specimens of the Mexican Conopsis nasiis (Biologia Centrali Ameri- 

 cana, Rept., p. 97). Sufficient material is not accessible to determine 

 either the constancy or the value of this character, and it seems best for the 

 present to retain these snakes in the genus Coniia.

Lodia tenuis B. and G., was based upon one example from 

 Puget Sound, Oregon, agreeing with C. 7nitis except in having a 

 small additional plate between the prefrontals, and the loreal reach- 

 ing the eye under the preocular. As no further specimen has 

 come to light in fifty years, it seems safe to refer this unique 

 example to the class of anomalies, the head plates being usually 

 variable in these small burrowing forms.

If due attention be paid to juvenile characters, the Nortli 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. Qd 



American species of Diadophis must be limited to three. Baird 

 and Girard established two olliers, which with a third of his own 

 making, Cope regards as subspecies of D. amabilis. In these 

 forms the chief differences are in the shape of the frontal and 

 supraocular plates, and in the extent to which the dark dorsal area 

 invades the two outer rows of scales. But a series of the eastern 

 form, D. punctattis, of all sizes, shows that exactly these differ- 

 ences, in that species, are age characters, and in a genus whose 

 included forms are so nearly similar, there can be little doubt that 

 they are so in amabilis as well.

 I. c, 616, 617, and Rep. Nat. Mus., 7.51, 750; Coronella punctata 

 Boul., I. c, II, 206. 



Head not very distinct; head plates normal; in adults the fron- 

 tal is much narrowed behind and acute; oculars 2 (l)-2; tem- 

 porals 1-1; upper labials 8 (occ. 7); scales in 15 rows; ventrals 

 136-160; subcaudals 36-62. Length 355 mm. (tail 65). 



In adults the color is bluish black or brownish above, covering 

 the whole of the dorsal scales and extending like a bar upon the 

 end of each ventral; the belly is yellow or orange, sometimes with 

 a series of transverse dark blotches in the middle of each ventral, 

 these are, however, often absent; there is usually a yellow half- 

 collar on the nape, half a scale to a full scale in width; the lower 

 half of the upper and the whole of the lower labials is yellow with 

 small spots of black. In the young, the back is bright reddish 

 brown or salmon color, which reaches only the upper border of the 

 second row of scales, and extends downward as the color deepens; 

 the top of the head is dark brown and the nuchal collar is bor- 

 dered behind by a band of the same dark color; the frontal plate 

 is also more angular in front and less tapering behind, than in the 

 adult. 



Hab. — North America, east of the Mississippi river.

This species covers the United States from the Atlantic coast to 

 the central plains, and extends southwest into Mexico, and varies 

 to an extreme degree, with the usual result in classification. Prof. 

 Cope's scheme of the directive color variations of 0. doliatus, 

 guided by " bathmism," published in completed form in The 

 American Naturalist, 1893, p. 1066, and finally in Tlie Primary 

 Factors of Organic Evolution, p. 29 (1896), is a remarkable 

 example of the employment of that great gift, the scientific 

 imagination, in a wrong field; for if that work be compared with 

 a large series of doliatus, it becomes evident that the subspecies 

 added by Cope to complete the chain are no more than selected 

 cases, the numberless promiscuous variations being wholly 

 ignored. The course 'of change from a brown-spotted to a red- 

 ringed snake has not been as orderly, nor as easih' marked ofi, as 

 is there assumed, and in subdividing the species, natural limita- 

 tions are not readily found.

Largest of the subspecies; temporals 2-2; scales in 21 rows; 

 ventrals 190-214; subcaudals 43-55; length about 1,100 mm. 



Body color gray; the dorsal spots are about thirteen scales wide 

 and rarely extend below the iifth row; they are chocolate brown, 

 with black borders in adults, and quite red in the young, and 

 number 40-46 on the body, and 10-13 on the tail; a second 

 smaller alternating series on the sides, which does not reach the 

 ventrals, and a third series of irregular black blotches on the ends 

 of the ventrals; the belly is whitish, blotched with black. The first 

 dorsal spot is commonly extended forward and ends in a conspicu- 

 ous angle on the frontal, the arms of which enclose a triangular 

 light patch; there is a black band across the prefrontals, often with 

 a hght centre, and a narrow dark oblique streak behind the eye, 

 bordered above by a light one.

The dorsal spots are less numerous, from 21-36 on the body and 

 6-10 on the tail; they are wider and end from the third to the first 

 row of scales; the alternating spots are correspondingly lower and 

 invade the ventials. The head markings are sometimes much 

 as in triangulus but less distinct; there is usually an oval light 

 patch surrounded by a black ring, in place of the triangular mark; 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 73 



this is sometimes more or less extended transversely, becoming a 

 haif-collar; this is the form called collark by Cope; often the ante- 

 rior ring is represented by a black bar on the nape, and sometimes 

 the ring is altogether absent and there is a light spot on each 

 supraocular and another on the parietals, the rest of the head 

 markings beiug more or less obsolete; this is temporalig Cope, but 

 the intermediate stages are so many that it is quite arbitrary to 

 regard these patterns as distinctive. The spots range in color from 

 brown to red. The oblique streak behind the eye is present. 

 0. d. dermis is a transitional form of great variability, and it is by 

 no means always easy to distinguish it from 0. d. triamjulus on the 

 one side and 0. d. doliaius on the other ; but I find that on the whole, 

 compared with triangulus, it has a greater width and lessened 

 number of dorsal spots and a want of definition in the head 

 markings, associated with fewer ventrals and subcaudals; it may 

 1)6 distinguished from O. d. doUntus by the fact that the latter 

 lacks the oblique streak behind the eye and rarely shows any head 

 markings beyond a dark bar or blotch across the parietals. 



Hab. — This subspecies seems to occupy the southern portion of 

 the range of 0. d. triangulus. I have seen no examples from 

 further north than Trenton, N. J., and central Illinois.

Form short and stout in adults; temporals 2-2 (3); ventrals 

 200-210; subcaudals 44-55; length about 670 mm. (tail 100). 



Grouud color grayish white or yellowish; dorsal spots brownish 

 red, or red, with black borders; they are broad and reach to the 

 first row of scales, often extending well ou to the ventrals; the 

 lateral spots are small and largely upon the ventrals, wholly so 

 when the dorsals are widest. The belly is whitish or yellow with 

 black blotches; the lower borders of the dorsal spots sometimes 

 form nearly parallel black bauds on the ventrals. The extreme 

 of this disposition is parallelus Cope. The top of the head is some- 

 times almost entirely black, but more usually this is reduced to a 

 bar across the parietals, the rest of the head being red or yellow. 

 The post-orbital stripe of the previous forms is absent. 



I cannot find characters which will bear examination in syspilus 




74 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Cope. No. 3,609, Academy coll., from Hennessey, Oklahoma,

 the head than most 0. d. doliatus, while underneath, anteriorly, it

 having parallel lines formed by the lower borders of the dorsal

Body rather more slender; temporals 1-2; ventrals 175-204; 

 suhcaudals 31-54; length 535 mm. (tail 70). 



Body color scarlet, completely encircled by pairs of black rings, 

 with interspaces white in the young, yellow in adults; no lateral 

 spots; belly paler than the back; top of head red, with the first 

 black rings crossing the parietals. The pattern is formed by the 

 obliteration of the lateral portion of the black borders of dorsal 

 spots, and the extension of their transverse portion entirely around 

 the body. The lateral spots have disappeared. 



This subspecies seems to be adopting burrowing habits in portions 

 of its range, and, as is frequent in such cases, the head plates and 

 scales are becoming variable, specimens being found without a 

 loreal and with the scales reduced to nineteen rows. This extreme 

 reduction is Osceola elapsoidea B. and G., and is not common, but 

 intermediate stages are frequent; out of some thirty specimens 

 colored as in coccineus, I have met but two without a loreal and 

 with 19 rows. The case is peculiar. If constant the distinction 

 would be a generic one ; on the other hand, the importance of the 

 character involved would seem to lift it out of the ordinary cate- 

 gory of 'intergradation, for we appear to have a subspecies being 

 transformed into a genus under our ej^es. Ou the whole, it may 

 accord best with a sound method to take no note of this form at 

 its present stage. 



Hab. — Xorth Carolina to Florida and west to the Mississippi 

 river. Specimens without a loreal are rarely found outside of 

 Florida.

Body rather short and stout; temporals 2-2 (3); scales in 21

 length about 700 mm. 



The black rings usually extend around the body as in 0. d. 

 coccineus, and the colors are very similar, but the spaces between 

 adjacent pairs of rings on the belly, opposite the red dorsal tracts, 

 are more or less filled up by black ; the whole top of the head is 

 usually black except the end of the snout, which is red. Some- 

 times the scales in the yellow rings are marked with black, and 

 often the black of the rings extends along the dorsal line, forming 

 a dusky band on the red spaces; when the black suffusion is want- 

 ing we have annulatus Keun., but it exists in all degrees.

0. multidratm Kenu. was founded on an individual from Ne- 

 braska having 8 upper labials; 23 rows of scales; three temporals in 

 the second row, dorsal spots with borders uuiting on the flanks, and 

 no rings nor spots on the belly. Mr. Stejneger reports a second 

 , specimen" with but seven labials. Twenty-three rows of scales; 

 temporals 2-3; with a greater or less number of dorsal spots are 

 not without precedent in 0. doliatus ; indeed, three out of five 0. d. 

 gentilk which I have examined have three temporals in the second 

 row. No. 3,613 Academy coll., from western Louisiana, is in com- 

 pany with a gentilis lacking the dorsal suffusion of black, and is 

 exactly like it in all other respects, except that the belly is immacu- 

 late and the dorsal .spots close on the outer row of scales; cor- 

 responding very closely to Kennicott's description of rnultistratus, 

 with the scutellation of gentilis. I see no reason, therefore, why 

 the first should not be iucluded within the range of this variable 

 form; the .same maybe said of annulatus K.euu., the differences 

 of which are trivial.

The Mexican forms of Ophibolus with rings are closely related 

 to this section. Mr. Boulenger has indeed united all of them with 

 anmdatus, under the name of 0. micropholis Cope, and Dr. Gun- 

 ther^ has done the same, using the name annulatuti. 



The one specimen of micropholis, from Nicaragua, ■which I 

 have seen, is certainly very like gentilis, and if the southern forms 

 are to be united, as stated above, (jentilis will probably have to be 

 added, and that name will have priority.

and alcoholic, I am unt able to subdivide it. Typical sai/i is 

 black, and has each scale with a white or yellow centre; the belly 

 is yellow with black Ijlotches and the head is black with small 

 yellow spots. In many cases the body spots collect into narrow 

 'transverse bands, leaving considerable spaces black with more or 

 less traces of the yellow spots; sometimes the lower seven or eight 

 rows of scales are spotted, and above them, on the dorsal area, the 

 spots collect into narrow bands connecting the spotted sides and 

 leaving a series of black, unspotted tracts on the back, three or 

 four scales long and seven or eight wide. This is splendidui< B. 

 and G. At the present time the collection of the Zoological 

 Society contains examples of both of these and more or less inter- 

 mediate stages, collected at the sam3 time at Pecos, Tex. On the 

 other hand, No. 4,451 Academy coll. is a very fair example of 

 splendidxis collected at Reelfoot Lake, Tenu., in 1895, by Mr. 

 Samuel N. Rhoads, and No. 3,585, from southern Illinois, clearly 

 indicates the same pattern, which is therefore not associated with 

 a restricted geographical area.

Black, crossed by transverse bands of white or pale yellow, one 

 and a half or two scales wide, at intervals of from five to ten 

 scales, generally bifurcating on the flanks and joining the anterior 

 and posterior ones, thus forming a chain-like pattern enclosing a 

 series of black dorsal blotches. An occasional Florida specimen 

 has some scales in the black areas with light centres. Two speci- 

 mens, one from Florida and one from Alabama, now in the 

 Zoological Gardens, have narrow white bands crossing the back, in 

 one at intervals of seven, and in the other of ten scales, without 

 bifurcating. The belly is white or yellow, with black blotches; 

 top of head black, nearly all the plates marked with white or 

 yellow; labials yellow, heavily margined with black. 0. g. niger

Ophibolus Boylii B. and G., I. <•., 82 ; 0. g. boylii Co-pe, I. c, 613, and 

 Kep. Nat. Mus., 919 ; Coronella getiila (part) Boul., I. c, II, 197 ; 

 Lampropeltis boylii Yan Den., I. c, 169. 



Smaller than 0. g. sayi; scales in 23 rows (occ. 25); ventrala 

 218-255; subcaudals 46-60. The largest measurement given by 

 Mr. Van Denburg is 1,089 mm. (tail 135). 



The body is black or brownish, with rings of white or yeUow 

 about two scales wide on the back, which widen on the sides until 

 they are wider than the black interspaces; sometimes the direction 

 of the rings is oblique, so that on the belly and even on the back 

 the ends alternate, instead of meeting; the top of the head is 

 black with small light spots and the snout is white or yellow. One 

 of two living specimens lately received from Yuma, Ai"iz., by 

 courtesy of Mr. Herbert Brown, has the light bands only indicated 

 by white spots on a few lateral scales, across the back there being 

 no more than a brown shade on the deep black of the body color; 

 the top of the head is wholly black, the lower labials white, 

 heavily margined with black.

The relations of this snake to 0. g. boylii are uncertain, and it 

 is quite possible that the specimens known are but abnormal color 

 variations of that species; there are usually 23 rows of scales; 

 oculars 1-2 (3); temporals 2-3: ventrals 226-236; subcaudals 

 50-58. The body is black or brownish with little constancy in the 

 markings; at times more o" less of the white rings of boylii are 

 present, but broken up and interspersed with short longitudinal 

 white stripes, and according to Mr. Van Denburg, there is a 

 white or yellow stripe or series of spots on the back; the head is 

 colored as in boylii, and the belly is yellow or white, with or with- 

 out black blotches.

 temporals 2 (l)-3 (2); scales in 21-23 rows; ventrals 199-224; 

 subcaudals 45-66. Length about 900 mm. (tail one-sixth). 



The body is encircled by narrow white or yellow rings, between 

 which are black ones, which are more or less replaced or divided 

 by red; all the rings are narrow, and the red is more pronounced 

 anteriorly, being often altogether absent on the hinder part of the 

 body; head yellow with a black band across the middle and an- 

 other on the nape. 



Mr. Boulenger, as it appears to me rightly, has referred this 

 species lo zonatus of Blainville.

Body color pale brown, with a dorsal series of small dark brown 

 blotches with indistinct black borders; these are about eight or 

 nine scales wide and not more than two long, and may number as 

 many as fifty on the body; the interspaces are wider than the 

 spots; a series of irregular small blotches on the side, often alter- 

 nating with the dorsals and reaching the ventrals, the lower end 

 sometimes breaking off and forming a detached spot on the end of 

 the ventrals; belly yellowish white clpuded with pale brown; no 

 head bands, nor spots on the nape; a narrow oblique streak behind 

 the eye; labials whitish slightly margined with dark brown.

Body color pale grayish brown; a dorsal series of subquadrate 

 blotches, dark brown with narrow black borders, two to tliree 

 scales long, eight to ten wide, somewhat emarginate before and 

 behind; the interspaces are about equal to the spots; a smaller 

 alternating series on the sides, which often form irregular vertical 

 bars, and a third on the outer row of scales and ends of the 

 ventrals; belly yellowish, with or without square black blotches on 

 the centre. The head markings are sometimes very elaborate; in a 

 beautiful specimen formerly in the collection of the Zoological 

 Society, from Minnesota, the top of the head was yellowish, with 

 a brown band across the prefrontals; an arrow-headed mark, 

 brown with a black border, the base on the frontal and apex just 

 behind the parietals; a brown spot on the hinder end of the supra- 

 oculars and a faint dark oblique streak behind the eye. Labials 

 yellow. An elongated brown blotch with black border, on each 

 side, running back from the parietals to the neck. The markings 

 are, however, not always as distinct; a second living specimen, from 

 Missouri, has the whole color darker, the lateral spots quite 

 obscure, no dark blotches on the ventrals, and the head markings 

 indistinct. The general aspect of this snake is very like rhom- 

 bomaeidatus, but it has 25 rows of scales; the ground color is 

 grayish brown ; the dorsal spots are less narrow, and the head 

 bands almost always distinguish it at a glance.

 has a yellow centre; many of the scales in the outer rows are 

 tinged with red. The snout in front of the frontal plate is red, 

 behind that black, each scale marked with yellow. Labials 

 yellow, all the upper ones posterior to the third, heavily margined

 than the back and indistinctly vermiculated with light brown; a 

 faint dark band from the rostral to the temporals, slightly bordered 

 above with yellow and below with black; labials colored like the 

 ventrals, the upper ones slightly spotted with dark brown. The 

 foregoing description is taken from two living specimens, one from 

 Florida and one from Bay St. Louis, Miss. 



As none of the three examples of this rare snake which I haVe 

 examined, possess scale pits, it cannot be placed in Lloplm, as is 

 done by Boulenger, but falls into the section of Rhadinea with 

 slightly diacranterian dentition.

The "sand snakes," "hog-nosed snakes," or "blowing

 the anterior portion of the body when alarmed, and thereby to 

 assume a threatening aspect, as in the cobras, but they are abso- 

 lutely harmless.

 snakes so nearly resemble them in color, especially the red and 

 j'ellow-ringed forms of Ophibolm doUatiis, that novices in herpe- 

 tology should beware of handling living specimens presenting these 

 colors, until assured that they are not dealing with an Elaps. 

 There are some twenty-five known species, extending from South 

 Carolina to Brazil, two only being found within the United States.

Rostral small, not extending between the internasals, which are 

 rather small; oculars 1-2; temporals 1-1 (2); upper labials 7, 

 third largest; ventrals 203-2.37; suljcaudals 25-45. The largest 

 I have seeu, measured 930 mm. (tail 70). 



There are 11-17 black rings from seven to ten scales long, and 

 the same number of red ones from 8-12 scales long on the body; 

 the black ones are bordered before and behind by yellow rings, 

 one or two scales long; many scales in the red rings are mottled 

 with black ; there are three or four black and an equal number of 

 yellow rings on the tail, but no red. Top of the head in advance 

 of the parietals i.s black, followed by a yellow ring extending to 

 the angle of the mouth; then a black one 5-8 scales long. Ex- 

 amples are said to be found in Florida with the black rings much 

 narrowed, and the snout red instead of black. These are referred 

 by Prof. Cope to E. dktans Kenn. , the typu of which was from 

 Chihuahua. Such specimens must in any event be very rare, for 

 the Zoological Society has received more than eighty Elajis from 

 Florida, not one of which has exhibited the characters of distans. 



Hab. — South Carolina to western Texas and up the Mississippi 

 valley, occasionally to southern Ohio; northern Mexico.

This little-known species closely resembles E. fulvius ; the rostral 

 is produced posteriorly and extends slightly between the internasals ; 

 the frontal is very small ; the black of the snout extends back over 

 the jiarietals and is followed by a yellow ring, then by a wide red 

 one; the red rings do not show black mottling on the scales. Ven- 

 trals 215-241*; subcaudals 21-29. 



Hab. — Central and southern Arizona; northern Mexico.

The name " water moccasin, " properly belonging to this species, 

 is often wrongly applied to large, dark individuals belonging to 

 Tropidonotus ; but the shape of the head, the presence of the loreal 

 pit, and the sharply tapering tail, easily distinguish it.

Body color peculiar yellowish pink, often pale drab, crossed by 

 irregular brownish red bands with darker borders, wider and often 

 with pale centres on the sides; a series of small circular brownish 

 red spots on outer rows and ends of the ventrals, anteriorly these 

 are mostly on the ventrals; belly yellowish or pink, sometimes

Sistrurus catenatus Rafinesque. 



Crotalinus catenatus Eaf., Amer. Monthly Mag., 1818, p. 41. 



Short and stout; tail about one-ninth of length; rattle small; 

 head plates normal; there is no large loreal, and the upper pre- 

 ocular is in contact with the post-nasal; occasionally the anterior 

 end of the preocular is cutoff, forming a small upper loreal; scales 

 in 23-27 rows, one or two of the outer smooth; ventrals 135-157; 

 subcaudals 17-34. 



The color is gray, brown or even black, with seven series of 

 blotches on the back; the dorsal series dark brown with a narrow 

 light border, anteriorly often crescent-shaped, posteriorly becoming 

 subcircular; the second series roundish and indistinct, more or less 

 alternating with the dorsals; third, vertically elongated, colored 

 like the dorsals and opposite to them; fourth small and on the 

 outer rows and ends of the ventrals; belly yellowish, more or less 

 marked with black. Top of head with a light band across the 

 anterior end of frontal; two dark bands running back from the 

 supraoculars to the first dorsal spot, and a dark spot between them 

 on the parietals and frontal; a dark oblique streak behind the eye 

 bordered above and below by a light line, the lower one beginning 

 at the nostril and running to the angle of the mouth; two litrlit 

 lines from the loreal pit to the labial border. 



It has been customaiy to divide this species into a northern and a 

 southern race, but the characters ascribed to them are less constant 

 than has been supposed, and they were, in fact, united by Mr. 

 Boulenger; nevertheless, the greater proportion of the individuals 

 found within each geographical area do present sufficient differ- 

 ences to warrant their separation: 



Scales usually in 25 rows; dorsal spots usually less than 40, 



1. -S'. c. catenatus. 

 Scales usually in 23 rows; dorsal spots usually more than 40, 



2. S. c. eonsora.

 I. c, 14, 16. C. c. catenatus Cope, I. c, 685 ; Sistrurus catenatus 

 (part) Bovil., I. c, III, 57(1 ; S. catenatus Stej., I. c, 411 ; S. c. cate- 

 natus Cope, Rep. Nat. Mus., 1146. 



In this northern race, the scale rows are usually 25, but occa- 

 sionally 23 or 27; the dorsal spots are larger and fewer in number 

 than in consors, being generally from .37-41 in number, of which 

 3-.5 are on the tail, but an occasional example has them as numer- 

 ous as in the southern form. No. 7,241 Academy coU. is a 

 catenatus from Fort Riley, Kans., with 27 rows of scales and 44 

 dorsal blotches, of which 9 are on the tail, leaving the number of 

 body spots about as they should be. No. 7,240 has also 27 rows, 

 and only 37 spots, with a black belly. Nos. 7,243-44 are two 

 interesting specimens, collected together in Michigan; the former 

 has 23 rows and 37 spots and the belly is immaculate yeUow; the 

 other one has 27 rows and the belly is wholly black. 



The colors are usually darker and the lateral spots more distinct 

 than in consors. Occasional examples are entirely black. Ven- 

 trals 136-1.50; subcaudals 17-29. 



Length about 900 mm. 



Hab. — Ohio to Kansas, and north into Canada. Formerly 

 found in western New York, but it has now disappeared from most 

 cultivated localities. 



Sistrurus oatenatus consors B. and G. 



Crotalophorus consors and C. Edwardsii B. and G., I. c, 12, 15 ; C

 and S. c. edwardsii Sle]., I. c, 415, 416 ; 8. c. edwardsii Cope, Rep. 

 Nat. Mus. 1144. 



Compared with the preceding this subspecies is probably rather 

 smaller; the scutellation is similar, but the scale rows are usually 

 23, though -sometimes 2-5 ; the dorsal spots are smaller and more 

 numerous, being in most cases 40-50 in number, of which 4-6 are 

 on the tail. Variations toward S. c. catetiatus are not uncommon, 

 however; No. 7,234 Academy coll. from Hennessey, Okla., 

 labeled edtvardsi, has 25 rows of scales and 44 spots, and No. 

 7,235, from Texas, has 23 rows of scales and but 37 spots. 



The correct name of the southwestern form of Sidrurus has 

 been iu doubt, owing to the loss of Baird and Girard's type of 

 C. consors, and the omission of some important details from their 




100 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



original description. The Zoological Society has lately received a 

 living Sistrurm from Port Lavaca, Calhoun county, Tex., practi- 

 cally the type locality of eonsors, which agrees with Baird and 

 Girard's description of that species in all respects, as well as with 

 Garman's Matagorda specimens. It has 25 rows of scales, the two 

 outer, smooth; 53 dorsal blotches (45 on the body and 8 on the 

 tail); ventrals 153; subcaudals 27; length 520 mm. (tail 70). 

 There is no large loreal and the preocular is in full contact with 

 the post-nasal. As edivardsi is known to sometimes present 25 

 scale rows, there is nothing to separate the two forms except an 

 insignificant difference in the number of spots. Regarding them as 

 identical, the name eonsors has priority. 



Hab. — Indian Territory to northern Mexico; west to Arizona.

 I. c. III, 569 ; Stej., I. c, 418 ; Sistrurus miliarus, Cope, Rep. Nat. 

 Mus., 1141. 



Smaller and more slender than S. catenatus ; rattle very small ; 

 loreal present, separating the post-nasal from the preocular; scales 

 in 23 rows (occ. 21); ventrals 127-140; subcaudals 20-36. 

 Length about 550 mm. (tail between one-seventh and one-eighth). 



Gray, yellowish or brown, more or less dark; seven series of 

 blotches on the body, disposed much as in the genus; the dorsals 

 are dark, often purplish, irregular in shape, and from 38—45 in 

 number; the interspaces on the vertebral line are often red; the 

 head markings are much as in the last species, but the dark spot 

 on the parietals is absent and the lower light line on the side of the 

 head begins ou the post-oculars, instead of the nasal ; belly yellow 

 with blackish blotches.

Notwithstanding the vvide range of this genus, through the 

 wliole of America from lower Canada to Brazil, its members form 

 a very compact group and though many of tlie species resemble 

 each other closely, there is a curious absence of transitional charac- 

 ters, so that it is necessary to recognize as distinct species, forms as 

 closely similar as adamanteus and airox, as well as confliientus and 

 oregonm (=^ lucifer B. and G.), in which the differences, though 

 slight, are, as far as I can discover, absolutely constant.

'* There has been disagreement as to whether the Linnieau name durissus 

 belongs to this or to the South American species. Mr. Boulenger adopts it 

 f.ir tliis species and uses tcrrificus Laur. for the South American. To me 

 the case appears otherwise. Linnseus' scanty description does not sufficiently 

 indicate either, but examination of his references, to determine the basis of 

 his species, shows that Seba's p'ates best iudirale the South American form, 

 and in the text (Seba, II, 99) Mexico is the most northern locality referred 

 to. LinnjEus' paper in the Amanitates AcadcmiiAV, I, SOC, and Gronovius 

 both treat of specimens from South America ; wliile the only North Amer- 

 ican rattlesnake ajipareutly known to Kalm was the most northern of all 

 (horridni h.). Ii appears then tliat duriisus L. is a compound, not of 

 the South American and the diamond rattlesnakes, but of the former and 

 the Northern banded species. But Linna'us' description, " Albo fluvogue 

 ■efiriun, mii<-uli» rhmnbcis disco tilbi.^," cannot appl}- to the latter ; durissus, 

 therefore, should be restricted to the Soutli Araericin form. Laurenti's 

 description of terrijlcus is not much more ample tliau that of Linnaeus, but 

 lie refers his species to Seba's I'l. 9.5, fig. 1. in which the only recognizable 

 detail, the scutellation on the muzzle, most clearly indicates the South 

 Atnerican species ; Ie7'rificiis L:iur. is, therefore, a synonym of durissus L.; 

 durissus Laur. is a compound of Linnanis' description, abavc quoted, and 

 C ite.-iby's PI. XLI, Vol. ii, which is Jinrridus. I am unable to find evidence 

 than any of theie authors knew of the existence of a rattlesnake in North 

 America other than horriilus \ and the lage diamond rattlesnake of the 

 Gulf States rema-ned unrecognized until 1799, when Heauvais applied to it 

 tie name adnmantms.

scales in 27-29 rows, as in most of the species the first and second 

 rows are faintly keeled or smooth; ventrals 169-178; subcaudals 

 25-32. The largest specimen I have seen, measured 1,910 mm. 

 and came from St. Simon's Island, Ga. It was formerly in pos- 

 session of the Zoological Society. There is little doubt that the 

 species reaches 2,200 mm. or more. 



Yellowish gray above, with lozenge-shaped dorsal blotches 

 sharply defined, blackish, with centres of the body color, and 

 separated by oblique yellow lines crossing each other on the back; 

 on the sides in the triangular open spaces which alternate with the 

 lozenges, there is a black spot; other indistinct markings some- 

 times appear on the sides; posteriorly the colors are somewhat 

 darker aud the lozenges take the .shape of cross-bands, which form 

 not very well-defined rings on the tail, but the colors there are not 

 sharply contrasted; belly yellowish white, clouded with brown 

 toward the sides. There is a wide dark oblique streak from below 

 the eye to the labials, bordered in front and behind by a light one; 

 two light bars from the loreal pit to labials, and another in front 

 of the nostril. 



Hab. — North Carolina and Florida; west to Louisiana and prob- 

 ably eastern Texas. 



Crotalus atrox B. and G. 

 I. c, 5. 

 The western representative of ihe diamond rattlesnake is very 

 like it in appearance, but may always be distinguished by the 

 absence of the light vertical IJue in front of the nostril, by the 

 absence of sharply defined angles to the dorsal spots and by the 

 strongly contrasted black half rings on the tail. A rare form, 

 known only from southern California, is retained as a subspecies.

 subcaudals 23-28. Of many specimens the largest I have seen 

 measured 1,670 mm. 



Yellowish or grayisli, sometimes quite brown, with a series of 

 dark brown or black dorsal spots, with centres of the body color; 

 the angles of the spots are not sharp as in adamanteus, but are cut 

 off, forming irregular hexagons; the lateral markings are indis- 

 tinct; tail gray or white, with 3-5 dark brown or black half- 

 rings; belly yellowish, more or less clouded on the sides. The 

 oblique streak behind the eye is present, but the light line in front 

 of the nasal is always absent. Some young examples have a nar- 

 row light line across the middle of sujDraociilars.

Grayish or yellowish brown., with a dorsal series of subquadrate 

 dark brown blotches with rather lighter centres, and sometimes 

 a yellowish border; the corners are often rounded, and posteriorly 

 the spots become cross-bands; two series of smaller alternating 

 blotches on the sides; belly dull yellow; a transverse light line on 

 the centre of the supraoculars, which widens and sometimes 

 bifurcates internally; in the young this is very distinct and the 

 anterior arm of the bifurcation is continued across the vertex to 

 meet its fellow; the oblique eye streak begins very constantly at 

 the lower anterior corner of the eye and is bordered by narrow 

 white lines ; a light line below loreal pit, and the borders of the 

 rostral are light in the young. 



Examination of the type of C. c. pulverulentus Cope does not 

 afford any good ground for distinction.

 Nat. Mus ,1175, 1176. 



Examination of the type of C. oregonus Holb. leaves me with 

 little doubt that it is identical with lucifer B. and G. The speci- 

 men has become much distorted and shriveled during the sixty 

 years since Holbrook examined it, but it shows no important 

 difference in scutellation. There are 6 scales between the supra- 

 oculars ; 3 between the suboculars and labials ; 25 rows of scales. 

 Holbrook' s plate does not quite correctly render the color pattern; 

 the dark streak behind the eye begins further back than is shown, 

 and really takes origin as in lucifer, posterior to the centre of the 

 eye. The dorsal spots are not as emarginate on the anterior border 

 as many of them are represented in the plate; they are, in fact, 

 sharply angled, giving a superficial resemblance to adamanteus 

 (which can be the only reason why Cope includes it in the syn- 

 onomy of that species) ; but much weight cannot attach to this 

 single point in which the specimen differs from lucifer, for the 

 reason that the epidermis has long since peeled off, leaving the 

 whole pattern accentuated; and the youth of the animal (315 mm. 




106 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



long) would also show these lines more sharply defined than they 

 would become later in life. The transverse light line on the supra- 

 oculars is precisely as in lucifer. 



This species comes very near to confluentus, but, on account of 

 the constancy of the slight differences, I am obliged to give it 

 specific rank; the head scales are rather smaller, the rows between 

 supraoculars numbering in six examples 4, 5, 8, 8, 8, 9; between 

 suboculars and labials 2-4; scales in 25-27 rows; ventrals 165- 

 189; subeaudals 18-26. Size about the same as confluentus. The 

 pattern is closely similar, but the dark oblique streak behind the 

 eye always begins posterior to its centre and runs backward directly 

 to the angle of the mouth, not curving downward as sharply as in 

 confluentus; the light lines bordering it are wider; the transverse 

 light line on supraoculars is present; the belly is yellow or green- 

 ish, with the posterior border of each ventral lighter. In some 

 specimens the general color is dark, approaching even to black.

 high; two rows of small plates l)ehind nasals; 4-8 scales between 

 supraoculars; 2-4 between suborbitals and labials; usually but one 

 plate on can thus; scales in 23-25 rows (occ. 27); ventrals 165- 

 178; subcaudals 18-25. 



Average specimens are about 900 to 1,000 mm. long, and it is 

 doubtful if the species ever much exceeds 1,400. 



Tlie body color is variable — sulphur yellow, ashy and almost 

 black (one specimen from Alabama was in life a peculiar pale 

 drab), crossed by twenty or more irregular chevron -shaped black 

 bauds; the bauds are sometimes complete, but often broken into 

 angular spots on the sides, but they always have a ragged or zigzag 

 appearance. The tail is black; belly yellow marked with dusky; 

 head dark, without distinct markings.

Crotalus prioei Van Denljurg. 



Pioo. Cal. Acad. Sci., 1895, 856 ; Cope, Eep. Nat. Mns., 1181. 



This species is known from five small specimens in the museum 

 of the Leland Stfinford University, California. 



From Mr. Van Denburg's description it appears to be charac- 

 terized by a rostral slightly higher than wide; enlarged plates on 

 the muzzle; one to three rows between supraoculars; one row 

 between suboculars and labials; and the presence of but nine 

 upper labials, the number in other species being 12-18; 21 rows 

 of scales; ventrals 153-159; subcaudals 21-27. Length to rattle 

 447 mm. (tail 41). 



Olive gray, thickly covered with small brown dots. Fifty-four 

 to sixty small brown blotches arranged in two series on the back, 

 somewhat alternating anteriorly, but forming cross-bands behind; 

 seven brown cross-bands on the tail; two or three rows of smaller 

 alternating brown spots on the sides; belly dark slate, ends of the 

 ventrals and outer row of scales whitish; a dark brown oblique 

 streak behind the eye; two small brown spots on the occiput; 

 throat yellow tinged with vinaceous. 



The peculiar characters of these specimens are'quite sufficient, as 

 far as they are now known, to entitle them to recognition.

" Differs from all others of the genus in having the rostral sepa- 

 rated from the anterior nasal by small granular scales; canthus not 

 sharp and without large plates; 6-7 scales between supraoculars; 

 3 rows between suboculars and labials; preocular sometimes 

 divided; 23-25 rows of scales; ventrals 178-198; subcaudals 26.

Ordinary specimens are grayish yell' i\v, with brown punctulations 

 on the back, which are collected into about forty transversely angu- 

 lar spots, which form cross-bands on the posterior fourth of the body; 

 tail light with distinct black half-rings; an indistinct l)rown streak 

 behind the eye, with a light one in front of it. Occasional exam- 

 ples are more or less red of varying shades; upon such specimens 

 C. pyrrhus Cope was founded.

CRUSTACEA OF THE CRETACEOUS FORMATION OF NEW JERSEY. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



From the earliest exploitation of the Cretaceous beds of New 

 Jersey, remains of Crustacea have been encountered by various 

 observers, most of whom contented themselves with merely men- 

 tioning the occurrence of crabs' claws. These remains have until 

 now escaped scientific description. 



The first notice ot crustacean fossils from the State, so far as I 

 know, is contained in Vol. I, part 2, pp. 195-198, of the Annak 

 of the Lyceum of Natural HUtory of New York (1824), where Dr. 

 J. Van Rensselaer gives a brief account and figures of four sup- 

 posed species from " the triangular peninsula comprised between 

 the ocean and the Delaware and Raritan rivers." The species are 

 not named, and from the information given cannot be identified with 

 certainty, but Nos. 1 and 3 may be Callianussa mortoni, and No. 

 4 is possibly C. conradi. 



Dr. S. G. Morton, in the American Journal of Science and Arts, 

 XVII, No. 2, p. 287 (1830), notices Van Rensselaer's work, and 

 mentions the finding of Astacus remains in Delaware; paraphras- 

 ing his remarks in the Synopsis of Organic Remains of the Creta- 

 ceous Group of the U. S., p. 74 (1834). 



The collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadel- 

 phia contains many .specimens from the deep cut of the Chesapeake 

 and Delaware canal, Delaware, and fi-om Monmouth and Burling- 

 ton counties, N. J., together with numbers without locality further 

 than " Cretaceous, New Jersey." During the last few years various 

 members of the Academy have added specimens from Lenola, N. 

 J., a locality unknown to the earlier collectors of Cretaceous fossils. 



It is noteworthy that all the specimens thus far seen are from 

 the " Lower Marl " beds; none have come to my notice from the 

 Middle or Upper Marls. 



I am indebted to Mr. Charles W. Johnson, Curator of the 

 Wagner Free Institute of Science, for various references and the 

 use of material in the museum in his charge, including specimens 




112 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



collected by William Wagner, Thomas H. Montgomery, Jr., and 

 himself. 



CALLIANASSA Leach. 



The glauconitic sands of the New Jersey Cretaceous are ill- 

 adapted for the preservation of delicate structures, and therefore 

 only the hard large claws of these soft-bodied Macrura are found. 

 Most of the species described from the Cretaceous, Eocene and 

 Miocene of Europe are likevvise based upon chehe. 



In the United States one Eocene species has been described,- C. 

 nlrichi White,' from specimens collected by Mr. E. O. Ulrich near 

 Little Rock, Ark., in a bed at first supjiosed to be Cretaceous. The 

 specimens before me were collected by Mr. C. W. Johnson at 

 Mabelvale, Ark. The propodite in this species is short and .squar- 

 ish, much as in C. conradi ; the lower border is somewhat crenate, 

 and well-preserved specimens show a tuljerculate tract on each side 

 behind the commissure between the fingers. The hand is com- 

 pressed, as in C. conradi. 



In Europe the fossil species from Mesozoic and Tertiary strata 

 are numerous and an excellent account of them has been given by 

 Milne-Edwards,' while notices and descriptions of various species 

 occur in the works of many other authors. The older species are 

 very similar to living forms, weak and soft-bodied burrowers in 

 the sand, and yet the genus has outlived most of its companions 

 on the shores of the Cretaceous seas. There is nothing like being 

 adapted to your circumstances. 



Our species apparently belong to that division of the genus in 

 which the fingers are of equal length, but they are clearly distinct 

 from any described European form.

convex side; the posterior inargin abruptly falling ne&r the joint, a 

 prominence bearing a group of small tubercles at the summit before 

 the deflection. Inner surface or palm (fig. 2) much less convex, 

 becoming concave near the lateral margins, nearly smooth, the 

 anterior margin slightly excavated between the root of the fixed 

 finger and the dactylopoditc, and bordered there with a short row 

 of small tubercles. On the median portion of the palm there are 

 two punctures, marking it oif into thirds longitudinally. Lateral 

 margins of the propodite acute, closely, finely and regularly crenu- 

 Jate; the lower margin straight, with a row of punctures along the 

 inner side but extremely near the edge, and another less close to 

 the edge outwardly; upper margin deeply curved down posteriorly, 

 produced into a deflexed lobe, and similarly margined with spaced 

 punctures. Fixed finger about one-third the total length of the 

 whole propodite, curved at the tip, finely crenate along the grasp- 

 ing margin when unworn, and with a blunt median tooth. 



Dactylopodite with two contiguous crenulate carinse along its 

 outer edge. 



Carpopodite (PI. I, figs 5, 6) somewhat shorter than the palmar 

 surface of the propodite, equally convex inside and out, turgid 

 anteriorly, its outer face with an oblique groove bordered with 

 small tubercles near the distal lower angle. Posterior u^jpcr angle 

 produced backward in a rather slender process. 



Meropndite (PI. I, fig. 7) sublriangular in section, the upper 

 keel strongly arched, lower keel nearly straight and more strongly 

 serrate, the middle of the very convex outer surface granulosa, 

 with two rounded tubercles at the anterior extremity; the opposite 

 or inner face nearly flat. In all specimens preserved with the 

 members in place, the meropodite is flexed at a right angle with 

 the carpopodite.

What Callianassa Jaujasi is in Europe to the Msestrichtien, C. 

 mortoni is on this side of the Atlantic to the ' ' Lower ^larl ' ' beds. 

 It is an abundant species, known by remains of over one hundred 

 individuals, chiefly the propodites only, though sometimes the 

 meropodite, carpopodite and propodite are preserved in place; 

 "when this is the case, it is usually due to their being more 

 or less imbedded in hard nodules. The abrupt deflection of the 

 hind margin of the more convex face of the propodite, and the 

 downward bend, posteriorly, of its upper margin ( as in fig. 3) 

 are characteristic of the species. 



Both chelae of a Lenola individual preserved in one nodule show 

 the right claw to be somewhat the larger. Otherwise the two 

 claws seem to be counterparts. I can find no other diflference. 



The largest specimens show a shallow, vermiculate wrinkling of 

 the surface, but the smaller are almost smooth to the eye or touch. 

 The crenulation of the margins becomes stronger with age, and is 

 occasionally lost or obscured by chipping of the edges. 



It is named for Samuel George Morton, one of the earliest 

 explorers of the American Cretaceous.

 Surface smoothish, with some small tubercles on each side of 

 the slight excavations on both sides of the hand near the com- 

 missure between the bases of the lingers ; the acute lateral edges 

 crenulated, as in C. mortoni, but the lower edge is not deilexed 

 posteriorly as in that species. Fixed fiiir/er triangular in section, 

 the angles crenulated, the flat grasping face with a short smooth 

 rib near the base, which joins the keel along the outer angle of the 

 finger.

In a few specimens the dactylopodite remains as a short stump 

 only. No carpopodite or other part is known. Thirteen propo- 

 dites, probably lielonging to as many individuals, are before me, 

 the most perfect being one of two in the collection of the Wagner 

 Free Institute of Science. 



The claw of C. conradi differs from that of C. mortoni in being 

 much shorter and broader; more evenl)- convex on the two sides, 

 the posterior margin of the outer side and the keel along the upper 

 edge are not abruptly deflexed behind; the fixed finger of the propo- 

 dite of C. conradi has no median tooth on its grasping face, which is 

 flat with a short smooth ridge and bounded by two crenulate 

 angles, while in C. mortoni there is a median tooth, a crenulate 

 ridge on the face, and no crenate angle along the lower inner part 

 of the finger. 



The name is in honor of Timothy Abbott Conrad, the ablest 

 of the early expositors of the Cretaceous and Tertiary faunas of 

 the United States.

HOPLOPARIA McCoy. 



The following species are referred to this genus with due reserve, 

 as until the cephalothorax is known their exact position in the 

 Astacoid series must remain doubtful. The specific characters of 

 the fossils, however, may be readilv appreciated; and the definition 

 of the species may call attention to the matter and lead someone to 

 search for the missing parts. 



Hoploparia gabbi n. sp. PI. I, figs. 11, 12, 13, 14. 



Right propodite robust, evenly convex on both "'sides, but 

 slightly more convex above than below, the surface slightly rough- 

 ened everywhere by small flattened, separated, scale-like asperities; 

 lower margin bluntly angular and marked by a slight groove ; upper 

 margin narrowly rounded, bearing a couple of short conic spines, 

 inserted slightly below the edge and directed downward and for- 

 ward; and on each side there is a rounded tubercle at the base of

 coarse tubercles (worn flat) along its grasping edge. 



Dactylopodite armed with a short conic spine near its base 

 (continuing the row of similar spines on the upper margin of the 

 propodite), its grasping face with a series of coarse tubercles, 

 worn flat. 



Carpopodite (?) irregularly cylindrical, gibbous, a little com- 

 pressed and faintly grooved along the outer side, bearing a series 

 of several short spines along the inner. 



Abdominal somites (PI. I, figs. 13, 14) with highly arched ter- 

 gum, the surface punctate. 



Lower Marl beds, Lenola, iS^. J. (C. W. Johnson, Uselma C.

 of the Delaware and Chesapeake canal. 



Cotypes are No. 527 Coll. A. N. S. and 5,941 Coll. Wagner 

 Institute, from Lenola, N. J. 



This species is based upon a right band and group of four 

 abdominal somites in the collection of the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia, and a right hand and carpopodite (?) 

 in that of the Wagner Free Institute. The fixed finger is broken 

 in both specimens, and the proximal portion of the hand is wanting. 

 In the Wagner Institute specimen the base of the dactylopodite 

 remains. 



A much smaller propodite from Monmouth county, N. J., shows 

 a series of four short spines along the upper margin; but perhaps 

 this specimen belongs to an alliea but distinct species, as it is much 

 less convex inside than the larger claws. In the large specimens 

 from Lenola only the anterior two spines remain, as described 

 above, owing to the loss of the posterior portion of the hand. 



On account of the mutilated condition of the remains, measure- 

 ments cannot readily be given; but an Astacoid somewhat larger 

 than the common Eastern crayfish is indicated. The figures are 

 of the natural size. The high arch of the abdomen may be partly 

 due to lateral compression. Unlil further remains come (o light, 

 and especially the cephalothorax, the generic position of the species 

 ■will be uncertain. It is named iu honor of William M. Gabb.

smoothish, showing scattered punctures and under a lens a very 

 fine punctulation ; on both sides of the hand a row of three or four 

 small pointed tubercles runs lengthwise along the median con- 

 vexity; lower edge bluntly biangular. Fixed finger nearly double 

 the width of the dactylopodite, pyriform in section, with a row of 

 tubercles along the grasping edge. Dactylopodite oval in section, 

 also bearing pointed tubercles opposed to those on the fixed finger. 



Length of propodite as broken 35 mm.; width 11.5, thickness 

 7 mm. 



Lower Marl beds, Lenola, N. J. (Charles "W. Johnson). Deep 

 cut of the Che.*apeake and Delaware canal (Coll. A. N. S. P.). 



Types are No. 10,120 Coll. Wagner Free Institute of Science, 

 and consist of an imperfect propodite with broken dactylopodite 

 in place, a fragment of the fixed finger, apparently of the same 

 specimen, and a fragment of another hand of larger size, width 

 14, thickness 9 mm. They were exposed by breaking hard nodules 

 which occur in the clay at Lenola. Another broken propodite is 

 in the collection of the Academy from the deep cut of the Chesa- 

 peake and Delaware canal, in Delaware. 



The species is readily recognizable by the long, narrow shape of 

 the hand and the minute punctulation of the surface, the biangu- 

 late lower edge of the fixed finger and hand, etc. It can hardly 

 be the smaller chela of H. rjabbl on account of the different 

 surface-sculpture, etc. 



BEACHYUEA (1) 



Remains of three crustaceans, probably short-tailed crabs, are 

 •contained in the collection of the Academy, but while specifically 

 characteristic by their peculiar sculpture, they are too fragmentary 

 to admit of generic reference, at least from my knowledge of the 

 group. 



One fragment shows keels on a smooth surface, somewhat like 

 the hand of Callinedes, though it is probably something very 

 difierent. 



Another (PI. I, fig. 17) seems to be the finger of some very 

 long-handed form. It lias three rows of long tubercles along the 

 grasping (?) face, three of smaller ones along the rounded, and 

 narrower outer margin, while a furrow ruus along each side. This 

 and the jsrecediug are from Monmouth county, N. J., but other 




118 PKOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



fragments, probably referable to the long-fingered crab, are in the 

 collection from Crosswicks, N. J. 



8ti]I other fragments (PI. I, fig. 18) are strongly spinose. I 

 take that figured to be a portion of a hand from -jvhich the fixed 

 finger has been broken off at the position marked f. The opposite 

 side bristles with three irregular rows of short spinei?, while smaller 

 ones are scattered over the palm. The socket for the dactylo- 

 podite is very large. 



These fragments are so .strongly marked and easily recognizable 

 specifically that I call the species Cancer{?) u'Jdtfieldi ; the geneiic 

 reference being admittedly merely provisional and to call attention: 

 to the necessity of examining further material; for it would be a 

 Cancer only in the Linn:pan limits of that genus. These fossils 

 are from Burlingtor county, N. J. The name is for Prof. E. P. 

 Whitfield, whose volumes upon the paleontology of New Jersey 

 have been of great use to workers in this field. 



There are also some densely granulose remains of portions of 

 limbs, possibly referable to Hoploparia or Astacodes, in the collec- 

 tion of the Wagner Institute from Lenola, N. J. ; but they are too 

 imperfect to alford data of value at present.

ON SOME POINTS IN THE PHYLOGENY OF THE PRIMATES. 

 BY ARTHUR ERWIN BROWN. 



The suggestions here offered, as to the possible orierin of certain 

 structural resemblances noted between anthropomorpha and one of 

 the family groups of existing lemurs, have resulted as a by- 

 product from a study of the interrelations of the Primates, under- 

 taken with a different purpose; they are put forth simply as a con- 

 tribution to the sum total of possibilities which, upon final sifting, 

 shall some day determine the exact degree and manner of the rela- 

 tionship between men, apes and monkeys, and not in any sense as a 

 demonstrated conclusion — for the reaching of which more de- 

 tailed knowledge of the early Tertiary mammals is required. 



In accounting for the later stages in the phylogeny of man, 

 three hypotheses are to be considered. 



The view of Darwin,' now held by a majority of systematists, 

 is that the anthropomorpha (here used to include man and the 

 higher apes) branched off from the main stem of monkeys after 

 its divergence from the lemurs. 



In 1860, Gratiolet" was led by a study of brain characters alone, 

 to the conclusion that each genus of anthropoid apes was descended 

 from an existing genus of monkeys; thus he derived Gorilla from 

 Cynocephalm ; AntJiropopithecus from Macacus; Sitnia and Hylo- 

 bates from Semnojiiihecus. This view has received little support 

 and the facts now known show its complete untenability. 



Lastly, Prof. E. D. Cope^ has suggested a common origin for the 

 anthropomorpha directly from the Eocene lemuroids, indepen- 

 dently of the line by which the monkeys came from the same 

 stock, being led to this conclusion by a study of the tendency in 

 certain races of men to the production of tritubercular upper 

 molars, which tendency he interprets as reversion, or retrogressive

 Evolution, p. 154 (1896). 




120 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



evolution toward an ancestral lerauroid tritubercular dentition. It 

 appears to me that this observation of Cope's does not stand alone, 

 and my present purpose is to indicate certain homologies which 

 appear to fall into line with it. 



In estimating the degree of relationship between men and apes, 

 on the one hand, and eatarrhine monkeys on the other, and that 

 borne by each series to their ancestral group, two sets of homolo- 

 gies are of especial value — those which the anthropomorpha share 

 with gome, at least, among lemurs (in which eatarrhine monkeys 

 have no part), and those connecting catarrhines with lemurs, which 

 are, conversely, absent from anthropomorpha. 



Some correspondences of much weight are disclosed by the teeth 

 and the vertebral column ; these will be briefly recapitulated with- 

 out extended description of details, which have already been given 

 in each case by recognized authorities, although it does not appear 

 that due weight has been given to their bearing upon the present 

 question. It may be added that almost all have been verified by 

 my own observations. 



In anthropomorpha there is an oblique ridge crossing the crowns 

 of the upper molars from /))-o<oco)!e to meiacone.* This is present 

 with great uniformity in the first and second human molars, as 

 well as in the third when it presents the quadri tubercular form, 

 and in examination of a considerable number of skulls belonging 

 to all four genera of anthropoids, I have found it in every case 

 where the crowns were sufficiently unworn to permit its disclosure. 

 Topinard lays much stress upon this crest and expresses the opinion 

 that it represents the posterior border of the primitive three-cusped 

 tooth, "^ from which the four-cusped has been evolved by addition of 

 a postero-internal cusp {hypocone). He states, further,' that the 

 crest is never absent in platyrrhine monkeys — an assertion which 

 appears to me too swcping, but traces of it are certainly found in 

 Ateles and Alouaita, and perhaps irregularly in other genera. It 

 is not found in any eatarrhine monkey, but reappeai-s in the 

 quadritubercular lemurs of the family Nycticehido,' comprising

Lorls, Nydicehus, Perodicticu-s and Arctocebus, and irregularly in 

 Microcebu^ and Galago.^ Of especial significance is the fact that 

 some of the more recently described Eocene Primate-i^'' present both 

 a small fourth cusp and traces of the oblique ridge on the first and 

 second upper molars. In all catarrhine monkeys both upper and 

 lower molars are quadricuspid, with strong transverse ridges con- 

 necting the opposite cusps." This arrangement is not found in 

 anthropomorpha, but is shown both above and below in Indris," 

 while Loris and Arctocebus show it in the lower jaw. 



Mr. Mivart" directs attention to the fact that in man the spinous 

 process of the third cervical vertebra is short and bifurcated ; in 

 anthropoids it is elongated and simple, while in monkeys generally 

 it is short and simple, as is the case in lemurs excepting in the 

 Nyctkebidce, among which in Nycticebus it is quite human, while 

 in Perodicticus and Arctocebus it is anthropoid. Similar corre- 

 spondences are exhibited by other parts of the spinal column. In 

 anthropomorpha (he spinous processes of the lumbar and the last, 

 or last two, dorsal vertebra; are directed backward, the transverse 

 processes are turned slightly backward (dorsally), and the ana- 

 pophyses and metapophyses are few in number and feebly devel- 

 oped. In catarrhine monkeys the corresponding spinous processes 

 are bent forward, so as to make a distinct point of convergence 

 about the next to the last dorsal with those of the anterior verte- 

 brae, which are inclined strongly in the opposite direction ; the 

 transverse processes are horizontal or more usually slightly bent 

 forward (ventrally), and the anapophyses and metapophyses are 

 strongly developed and begin usually in advance of the seventh 

 dorsal, extending posteriorly through the whole of the lumbar 

 vertebrae. 



In all these respects lemurs agree with monkeys, excepting again 

 the Nycticebidtr, where the disposition is generally as in anthro- 

 pomorpha.

122 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Jan., 



The sacrum in anthropomorpha is composed of five or six 

 coalesced vertebrre ; in monkeys the normal number is two or three, 

 and a like number is shown by lemurs, except Indris, which has 

 four, and Perodicticus and Ardocebus, each of which has five." 



Now if we attempt, from Gratiolet's standpoint, to account for 

 the presence in anthropoids of so many of the above characters as 

 their supposed ancestors do not possess, inheritance being excluded 

 by the very terms of the hypothesis, we are driven to analogous 

 variation as the only process with which we have any acquaintance 

 which might be held competent to explain them. 



But, so far from there being any good reason to assume that 

 analogous variation has been a frequent method in nature, there 

 is, on the contrary, warrant for an a, priori belief that the mere 

 mathematical chances against the occurrence of any single case of 

 it are very great; so that where, as in the present circumstances, 

 seven cases of the independent development of almost exactly simi- 

 lar characters must have taken place in each of four genera (to say 

 nothing of man, who is not provided for by the hypothesis), the 

 improbability becomes so enormous as to remove it from rational 

 consideration." 



The theories of Darwin and of Cope remain to be examined, and 

 it may be said at once that no one of the homologies which have 

 been noted is excluded by either of them, but there is, in my belief, 

 a wide difference in their relative probability ; that of Cope being 

 so far the most simple, that it is logically indicated for our accept- 

 ance. 



Darwin's hypothesis requires us cither to suppose that there has 

 been an extensive and complicated process of preservation of cer- 

 tain structures and suppression of others, in which the family 

 groups now differ, or to take refuge again in analogous variation. 

 Both are rendered difficult of acceptance by the reflection that of the 

 characters here advanced few, if any, can be believed to have been 

 adaptive. It is unsafe to dogmatically assert that a given structure 



"Mivart, P. Z. X, ISCS, p. 5G0. 



"Furthermore, the same principle must he invoked to account for the 

 ahsence of the cusp-bearing heel on mj, possessed by each of the snpi>osed 

 anc»-stral genera ; for the presence of three external Jcusps on the lower 

 molars ; the presence of a vermiform appendix ; the independent origin of 

 the left common carotid from the arch of the aorta, and the converging di- 

 rection of the hair on the arms toward the elbow, all of which are peculiar 

 to anthropomorpha. 




1901.1 XATLEAL SCIENCES OF nilLADELPHIA. 123 



can never liave been of adaptive character, but we are at least 

 entitled to cousidei that if monkeys in general have flourished 

 luxuriantly with transverse ridges on the crowns of their upper 

 molars, and at most three sacral vertebroe, a slight oblique ridge 

 on the upper teeth and two or three additional vertebroe in the 

 sacrum can hardly be supposed to have had selective value to 

 anthropoids. 



The remaining theory, that of Cope, would account for the con- 

 ditions noted by the process of direct and simple inheritance, and 

 requires no greater amount of assumption than has more than 

 once been justified in the course of phylogenic speculation. Frag- 

 mentary as are the remains of the Eocene lemuroids which have 

 come to light, they are enough to show that while the group as a 

 whole was generalized, it yet presented at that early period, a con- 

 siderable amount of variety in details, many of which have been 

 preserved in existing lemurs. Of these early forms we have 

 remains of little but jaws and teeth, but the many and curious 

 correspondences which have been noted between anthropomorpha 

 and the Xiidicebklce are best intelligible upon the supposition that 

 they originated in a group which, possessing the tooth characters 

 shown by each, had associated with them the other structures as 

 well; such may have existed nmong the Aiuqitomorphidw, but in 

 the present state of ignorance as regards the details of the remain- 

 ing skeletal structure of that group, it would be rash to attempt a 

 close specification, either of the particular form or of its geo- 

 graphical region. 



Cope's view of the independent origin of the anthropomorpha 

 was based upon the supposed tendency in the human race to revert 

 to a tritubercular form of molar. There are minds to which rever- 

 sion is but a convenient term denoting a process which it is rarely 

 possible to either prove or disprove; but whether or not it be 

 accepted in this case, " Prof. Osborn has figured the upper jaw of 

 a Primate" (possibly Indrodon) from the Puerco beds, possessing 

 quadritubercular upper molars, with traces of an oblique ridge— an 

 observation which greatly fortifies Cope's position. His case of 

 reversion, if admitted, would then lead a stage further back to 



"It is to be observed that Topinard's lefutation {l «•> P- 707) of Cope's 

 hypothesis is ha^etl upon a misunderstandinfj of its real terms.

124 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF LJan., 



the primitive three-cusped molar, which was in all certainty that 

 typical of the earliest lemuroids. 



The better agreement of this hypothesis with the successional 

 relations shown by paleontology, must be emphasized, for as far as 

 can now be determined, apes of anthropoid character, such as 

 Pliopithecus and Dryoplthecus, were already differentiated in the 

 middle Miocene, at which time, or even later, monkeys appear to 

 have been represented only by such intermediate forms as Meso- 

 pithecus. No existing genus of catarrhine monkeys is known from 

 earlier deposits than Popio and Macacus from the Sivalik beds of 

 lower Pliocene age, in which deposits other remains have been 

 found which there is reason to regard as referable to Anthro- 

 popitheciis and Shnia. The fact that Ijefore monkeys as now known, 

 began to exist, man-like apes were far advanced in development, 

 and that the earliest evidence of existing genera of apes is coeval 

 with that of existing genera of catarrhines, tells enormously in 

 favor of the early and independent origin of anthropomorpha. 



The objections to tliis view which arise from the closer corre- 

 spondence of anthropomorpha with monkeys, rather than with 

 lemurs, in many soft parts of the organism, are not to be over- 

 looked ; but the remarkable differences iu placentation and in the 

 anatomy of the sexual organs disclosed liy closely related genera, 

 and even species, in other groups; the smooth brains of marmosets 

 among monkeys, and the readily adaptable character of muscular 

 dispositions, and all structures relating to locomotion, renders these 

 characters of more or less uncertain value in classification. 



It is no part of the present purpose to inquire closely into the 

 corresponding stages in the pedigree of the remaining Primates, to 

 do which, indeed, we are yet too ignorant of many essential 

 details, but this much may be said : the Nycticehidce, which sug- 

 gest so many human and simian traits, are far from being typical 

 lemurs, with which in general structure the monkeys show much 

 agreement; but catarrhines and platyrrhines are wide enough apart 

 in many ways, and the period during which they have been thus 

 separated is so immeasurable, as to suggest the greater probability 

 that their chief characteristics were already differentiated in their 

 respective Tertiary forerunners. The remarkable fact that some 

 platyrrhine genera, as Atele^, present traces of nearly all the modi- 

 fications which have been noted as characteristic of anthropomorpha 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 12& 



and the Nycticebidce, perhaps supports this view, but at the same 

 time well illustrates the complexity of the problem. 



If the progress of paleontology should justify these specula- 

 tions, it seems to follow that it is likely to also demonstrate the 

 multiple rather than the single origin of the piesent Lemuroidea.

THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMPARATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE GIZZARD 

 IN THE ODONATA ZYGOPTERA. 



BY HELEN T. HIGGINS. 



The following study' was undertaken on the advice and under 

 the direction of Dr. Philip P. Calvert, instructor in Zoology in the 

 University of Pennsylvania. 



Dr. Ris' work on the gizzard of the Odonata and Dr. Calvert's 

 study of Californiau forms strongly suggested the phylogenetic 

 importance of this organ. 



The present study has been limited to the more primitive 

 Odonata — the suborder Zi/gojitera. 



I am indebted to Dr. Calvert for the material placed at my dis- 

 posal, for many of my preparations, including his slides used in 

 his paper of 1899 mentioned later, for the determination of genus 

 and species in every case, and for the suggestion of the structural 

 formula used in describing the gizzards. 



In 1896, Dr. F. Ris published" a paper entitled Untersuehungen 

 ilber die Gestalt des Kaumagens bei den lAbellen und ihren Larven. 



The results of his investigations are briefly outlined here: 



In the Odonata the fore-gut extends to the third abdominal seg- 

 ment. In larva and imago alike the gizzard is found at the pos- 

 terior end of the fore-gut in the second abdominal segment. It is 

 formed by a thickening of the muscle layer, and by a modification 

 of the chitinous coat of the fore-gut to form folds armed with 

 teeth. The number of these folds is four, eight or sixteen. The 

 metamorphosis to the imago shows a regular reduction in the 

 strength and complication of the elements, but their number varies 

 greatly. At the metamorphosis, the larval lining is shed with the 

 chitinous coat of the exterior of the body; Dr. Ris states that he 

 found in a Libellula, directly after metamorphosis, the old gizzard 

 linin«r enclosed within the new. He examined the larval and adult

 j)ennipes, Lestes idrens, Gomphm, uEschna, Anax, Cordulegaster 

 annulatus and bidentatus, Cordulia wnea, Diplax, Libellula, 

 Orthetrum. 



The conclusions drawn by Dr. Ris from his investigations are as 

 follows : 



Larva:. — The original form of the gizzard shows a division into 

 sixteen longitudinal folds, eight broad and eight narrow, which 

 bear an armature of irregularly placed teeth. This type is found 

 in the Calopterygince. 



A higher development of the organ appears iu the typical 

 group of the Agrioninw ; the sixteen folds show a greater number 

 of teeth and a more complicated arrangement of these. 



The legion Lestes shows a reduction of the sixteen folds to 

 eight, apparently through the loss of the smaller folds. These 

 eight folds are again divided into four broad and four narrower 

 folds. In the Anisoptera {Gomphus am\ ^E-ichna) there is reduc- 

 tion to four equal, similar folds. Finally, Cordulegaster and the 

 Libellulidte differentiate the folds into two pairs of teeth, so that 

 the original radial symmetry is changed to bilateral. 



Iiiwgos. — The series easily traced in the larval forms is some- 

 what confused in the imagos, owing to the reduction which inva- 

 riably occurs. The least reduction from larva to adult is found iu 

 the Calopterygince; more is shown in the Agrionince, where is seen 

 the tendency to eliminate the smaller fold in certain individuals; 

 the strongest reduction occurs in Gomphus and ^Eschnai in 

 Cordulegaster and in the Libellulidw scarcely more than a hiat of 

 the relation to the larva remains. 



This purely nwrphological development from the radial symme- 

 try of numerous elements of an organ to the bilateral symmetry of a 

 few elements runs parallel with the phylogenetic relationships of 

 the single groups. 



In a paper on the Odonata from Tepic, Mex.,' 1899, Dr. Calr 

 vert gives notes on the gizzards of the forms studied by him. 

 Contrary to Dr. Ris and other previous writers, he finds the posi- 

 tion of the junction of fore- and mid-gut, and therefore of the 



'Proc. Cat. Acad, of Sciences (Third Series, "Vol. I, No. 12, 1399).

Dr. Ris and Dr. Calvert agree generally on the morphology of 

 the forms studied by both. They differ, however, iu the phylo- 

 genetic position of the legion Le-stes. 



Dr. Calvert does not draw any phylogenetic conclusions from his 

 studies, considering the examination of many more forms neces- 

 sary before this can safely be done. 



Preparation of Present Material.— The present study has been 

 based upon representatives of the sub-families Calopterygince and 

 Agrioninte collected from every continent. 



The preparations have largely been made from dried* specimens. 

 From these the abdomens were cut off at the base of the third 

 segment and soaked in seventy per cent, alcohol until softened. 

 Some of these, even after long soaking, were so brittle that only 

 fragments of the gizzard could be mounted. In cases where, 

 because of its fragmentary condition, the structure of the gizzard 

 is at all doubtful, I have put an interrogation point after the 

 descriptive formula. The remainder of the material studied had 

 been preserved in alcohol or formaline. 



To obtain and prepare the chitinous lining of the gizzard for 

 study, the abdomen was slit open along one of the membranous 

 pleura, the gizzard located, and separated from the rest of the 

 alimentary canal by a fine pair of scissors. The gizzard was cut 

 open, the muscular coat removed with needles, and the chitinous 

 lining spread out flat upon a slide. After cleaning, this was 

 mounted in Canada balsam, making a very distinct preparation for 

 study. In nearly every case the dried specimens from which the 

 gizzards have been rem)ved have been again put together, so that 

 their value as ordinary museum material has been little, if at all, 

 impaired. 



The larvae studied belong mainly to the sub-family Agrionina.. 

 They were collected from the vicinity of Philadelphia and were 

 either fresh or preserved in alcohol.

Development of the Gizzard. 



The gizzard is a specially thickened and cuticularized portion of 

 the alimentary canal, appearing at the junction of fore- and mid- 

 gut, and projecting slightly into the latter. Externally is a coat 

 of circular muscle fibres, thicker in the larrse than in the adult 

 and varying in thickness in adults of ditferent genera. Within is 

 a layer of epitheUal cells, at first one cell in thickness, but later 

 becoming many cells thick iu definite areas, to form folds project- 

 ing into the lumen of the canal. 



In the forms examined, four folds or some multiple of four to 

 as many as thirty-two have been found — sixteen and eight being 

 the numbers most commonly occurring. 



From the epithelial cells is developed the inner chitinous coat of 

 the gizzard, which is thin on the spaces between folds, becoming 

 thickened on the folds and forming here horny teeth of various sizes. 



The writer has examined Agrionine larvae from the time of 

 hatching to the period immediately preceding metamorphosis. 



In larvae just hatched no evidence of any gizzard-armature was 

 found. 



The following statements refer to larvK of Isehnura vertiealU 

 Say: 



In larvse 3 and 4 mm. in length" the gizzard is quite clearly 

 marked (fig. 25). The chitinous coat shows sixteen folds or fields, 

 eight larger alternating with eight smaller. Each larger field is 

 armed with teeth arranged in two groups, an anterior and a pos- 

 terior, the latter occupying about the centre of the gizzard. The 

 posterior group consists of two large pointed teeth, each enclosed 

 on its outer side by four to five small teeth. The anterior group 

 comprises two pointed narrow teeth intermediate in size between 

 the two sets mentioned above. 



Each smaller field has one group of three to four small teeth, 

 which are at the same level as that of the posterior group of the 

 larger fields. 



A larva 6 mm. long shows practically the same armature, but 

 on the smaller fields also there are often two groups, the anterior 

 comprising one to two teeth, the posterior three to four. 



* In all of these larvse, by length I mean the distance measured from the 

 external anterior part of the head to the posterior limit of the last abdom- 

 inal segment, the gills being excluded. 



9 




130 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan. » 



A larva 8 mm. long shows considerable difference in the size and 

 number of the teeth (PL IV, fig. 26). The anterior groups of 

 both fields show an increase in the number of teeth, which remain 

 approximately the same in size. . In the posterior groups the 

 smaller teeth show decrease in size with increase in number; the 

 two large teeth of the larger fold remaining the same in size. 



A larva of 10 mm. length shows much the same slructure. 



Three larva; of 15 mm. lengih show the same line of develop- 

 ment carried a little further (fig. 27 ), an increase in number of 

 the teeth of the anterior groups of both folds, slight increase in 

 number with continued decrease in size of the small teeth of the 

 posterior groups of both folds. 



In all larvic studied the gizzard was found in the second ab- 

 dominal segment. 



Young imagos of Ischnwa verticalis were examined soon after 

 metamorphosis. In those dissected directly after the spreading of 

 the wings only the larval gizzard was observed. This lay in the 

 sixth segment. In an adult in which the coloring was distinctly 

 developed, the larval gizzard lining lay immediately within that 

 of the adult, which latter bore a very different armature (PI. Ill, 

 fig. 17). In still other individuals the adult gizzard was in the 

 sixth segment, while the lining of the larval gizzard and of the 

 fore-gut of the larva, coiled up in a mass, lay in the lumen of the 

 canal in the seventh segment. These observations suggest the 

 possibility of learning something of the structure of the gizzard 

 of the larviB of exotic species by inspecting the contents of the 

 alimentary canal of imagos whose colors show them to have but 

 recently transformed. 



To sum up the development of the gizzard lining in Ischnura 

 verticalis, it is seen that from its earliest appearance (which in the 

 present study was found in a larva 3 mm. long) there is a steady 

 increase in the number of teeth on nil folds with a deciease in size 

 in those of posterior groups. At metamorphosis the gizzard 

 moves backward from the second to the sixth abdominal segment. 

 A new chitinous coat is formed on the fore-gut, with a new gizzard 

 armature. The larval lining lying within the adult lining becomes 

 loosened from it and finally separates entirely, and is found, within 

 a few hours after metaniorpliosis, lying coiled up within the canal. 

 It is probable that in still older imagos the cast-ofi larval gizzard 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 131 



lining lies still farther posterior in the canal, and is finally voided 

 through the anus. 



The Gizzard of Various Adults. 



The position of the gizzard in the imago was found to vai-y from 

 the third abdominal segment to the seventh. In the majority of 

 forms examined the gizzard lies in the centre or posterior extremity 

 of the sixth segment; in a small number it lies in the fifth, in a 

 still smaller in the seventh, and in a very few in the third or 

 fourth segment. , 



Variations in the position are frequently found in different 

 species of the same genus and even in difierent individuals of the 

 same species. 



A male of CalopUryx apkalk had the gizzard in the anterior 

 end of the sixth segment, a female in the centre of the fifth; 

 while in a male of C. Cornelia it was located in the fifth segment. 



In a male of Pliaon iridlpennis the gizzard was found in the 

 posterior end of the sixth segment; in a male of P. fuliginoeits 

 in the third, and in a female of the same species in the sixth 

 segment. 



In four species of Vestalis the position varied only from the 

 posterior end of the fifth to the middle of the sixth segment. 

 The same variation was seen in five species of Helaerina, and like- 

 wise in four species of Euphoea. 



In the ? of Libel lago caligata the gizzard was found in the 

 third segment, in tne cf in the fifth, and in L. curta, cP, in the 

 fourth segment. In four individuals — two species — of Micromerus 

 it was found in the fifih; in Thore boliviana, c?, in the centre of 

 the fifth, in 9 in anterior end of seventh; iu Eidhore hyalina, 

 c?, in the anterior end of sixth, in ? in posterior end of fifth. 



Of the Agrionince, legion Pseudostigma, its position varied in 

 eight individuals, of five genera, from the middle of the sixth to 

 the anterior extremity of the seventh segment; in the Legion 

 Podagrion, in five males and one female of Paraphlebia sp. (group 

 of Zoe), the position varied only from the anterior end to the 

 centre of the sixth segment; in five species of the genus Betera- 

 grion, from the posteiior end of the fifth to the anterior of the 

 seventh; in the legion Plalycnemis, in four genera, the organ was 

 found in the sixth or seventh segment; in the legion Protoneura, 




132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan. 



— in three species of Duparoneum, iu three of Neoneura and in 

 three of Protoneura — the same variation is seen, from the poste- 

 rior end of the sixth to the anterior of tlie seventh; of the Legion 

 Agrion it appears in the sixtli segment iu Hyponeura lugens, 

 Ischnara heterodida, Enallaf/ma ebriiim, ijeminatum and asper- 

 sum, in Nehalennia lais, Ceriagrion glabrum, Anisagrion allopterum 

 and Hemiphlebia mirabilis ; in the fifth in Argia 2)utrida, Ptp-- 

 rhosoma tenellum ; iu the seventh in Leptugrion macruium and Lep- 

 tobasis vacillans; of the legion Lestes it appears in the sixth 

 segment in Lestes disjuncla and L. leda. 



Armature of the Adclt Gizzard. 



To save the necessity of giving lengthy descriptions of the 

 armature of each gizzard studied, and more especially to render 

 the comparison of these armatures more easy, it was found con- 

 venient to construct a formula whereby the general structure of 

 tlie armature might be indicated. 



Below is given an explanation of the formulae used : 



F, F, f, indicate specially chitinized areas of the gizzard lining, 

 whether they bear teeth or not. They may stand as abbrevia- 

 tions of "field" ("Felder" of Ris) or '"'fold." When the 

 fields are approximately alike only one size letter may be used — 

 ¥ ; when unlike, F will denote the largest sized areas, f medium 

 sized, f small sized When the areas are of but two sizes F an<i 

 f may be used. 



Arabic figure-^ following F, f, f, denote the number of teeth 

 borne by each field respectively ; when the number is great (40 or 

 more) >i is used to denote tliis fact. Wlieu iu one and the same 

 gizzard the teeth are of different sizes this is indicated bj- use of 

 the marks ', ", '" ; ' denotes the largest sized teeth, " medium 

 sized, '" smallest sized. 



Wherever a gizzard consists of a repetition of similar fields, the 

 formula may bo shortened by enclosing the repeated arrangement 

 within parentheses, and placing the proper coefficient before the 

 parenthesis to indicate the number of times the repetition occurs. 



When the same field contains two groups of teeth separated by 

 a distinct interval, these two groups are indicated iu the formula 

 by placing one abive the other with a horizontal line between them, 

 as in common fractions, the anterior group of teeth being repre- 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



senteil by the numerator, the posteriur group of teeth by the 

 denomiuator. 



The abbreviation rec. is used to indicate recurved teeth, as in 

 Paraplilebla. 



To illustrate the application of the formula, I may refer to fig. 

 13, P). Ill, of Argia hipundulata. In this species thfre are six- 

 teen folds, eight larger and eight smaller. The formula would be 

 therefore: 8 (F 12-14, f 1-3), where F represents the larger 

 fields, with teeth varying in numbfir from twelve to fourteen; f, 

 the smaller folds with teeth varying from one to three. 



The teeth here are all of approximately the same size. 



For Xaiithagrkm erythroneurum (fig. 15), where the teeth have 

 a definite arrangement into groups, we must use a more compli- 

 cated formula. Here there are sixteen fields, each field showing 

 two distinct groups of teeth. The anterior groups are represented 

 by the numerators of the fractious, the posterior by the denomina- 

 tors. The difference in size of the teeth is indicated by the 

 marks ' and ", the former representing the larger teeth, the latter 

 the smaller ones. 



The formula therefore is 8 (F 2' + "w''-i2" > ^ ^')- 

 The omission of one or more folds from an individual gizzard 

 is not uncommon (see fig. 12), so that often it is only possible to 

 construct a formula when several specimens of a given species are 

 examined and compared. 



The following list of the species of adults whose gizzard-armatures 

 have been studied gives the number of each sex examined, the 

 abdominal segment in which the gizzard was found (and often 

 whether in the anterior or posterior part of the segment), the 

 locality whence the material came and the armature formula:

Intra-oeneric Variations. 



By au examination of the structural formulae given above it 

 will be seen that a clasiification into genera based on resemblances 

 in gizzard structure would agree in most cases with that now in 

 use based upon the structure of wings and other external features of 

 the body. If, for instance, we examine the structural formula 

 for Sapho orichalcea and S. ciliata, we find very little difference 

 between the two species. In both we see sixteen fields, which in 

 the former are of three sizes, and in the latter of two. But the 

 number and size of ibe teeth are approximately equal. 



Where a number of species of one genus have been studied, 

 these all, as a rule, show the same number of folds. Exceptions 

 are seen in the genera Helcerina and Heteragnon. Of five species 

 of Hdwrina examined, four show eight folds of the gizzard lining, 

 and one, amerlcana, four folds, although another specimen of the 

 same species (PI. II, figs. 2 and 3) shows eight folds in both larval 

 and adult gizzard linings; of four species of Heteragrion three have 

 sixteen folds; one, eight. 



Even when they vary in the number of folds, species of the 

 same genus are seen to agree almost invariably in the size and 

 number of teeth on each fold, as well as in the arrangement of 

 these. 




140 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JaU., 



A marked exception to this wa? found in the genus Heieragrion. 

 Of four species of this genus, three had sixteen folds, varying 

 in size, the largest folds bearing numerous teeth (above forty), 

 the smaller ones bearing from five to thirty, while the fourth 

 species had but eight folds, each fold bearing numerous teeth. 



Again, of four species of Argia, three are similar, bearing 

 eight " F" folds and eight " f " folds, the teeth on all folds 

 being of equal size. But in the fourth species, A. agrioides, there 

 are four " F" folds, eight " f " folds, and four " f" folds; on 

 the two latter the teeth are equal in size, but on the four " F " 

 folds they are arranged in two groups, those of the anterior group 

 being similar to the teeth on the other folds, those of the posterior 

 being much smaller and recurved. 



Data for Phylogeny. 



When the studies whose results are contained in the present 

 paper were begun, it was hoped that they would yield data of 

 value in determining the phylogeny of the insects investigated. 

 The data are now at hand, but the desired interpretation is yet to 

 be made. One may spin several diftereut theories on the lines of 

 descent of these Odonata if regard be had merely to the armature 

 of the gizzard. Bui since these theories would rest on precisely 

 the same evidence in each case, it is wise to refrain from such 

 theorizing until these results can be correlated with others drawn 

 from embryological and comparative anatomical data. 



It is worth pointing out, however, as one present gain to our 

 knowledge which will bear on the question of phylogenies, that the 

 occurrence of numerous minute teeth only is a phenomenon of 

 frequent repetition, since it is met with in the genus Hetcerina of 

 the legion Calopteryz, and in all species of the legions Euphwa 

 and Thore of the Calopterygiiue, while in the Agrioninw it is ob- 

 served in Mecistogaster and Pseudosttgma (legion Pseudostigma) , 

 Philogenia (legion Podagrion), some Dwparoneura and Caconeura 

 (legion Proioncura) and all of the legion Leales. 



The problem which this phenomenon suggests is to determine 

 whether it represents a more primitive condition, originally common 

 to all gi-oups to which the genera named belong, or whether it 

 represents independent, parallel and similar modifications in each 

 group from some other and different form of gizzard-armature.

Relationships of the Gtnus Neoheliscus. — Dr. H. A. Pilsbry,

 American land snails,' stated I hat in commenting upon the pecu- 

 liarities of the reproductive organs he had overestimated their di- 

 vergence from structures of African Aehatinidm, having overlooked 

 a paper by Arruda Furtado, ' in which the anatomy of Atopocnehlis 

 exaratus is described. This genus and species, the speaker con- 

 tinued, is confined to the island San Thome, in the Gulf of Guinea ; 

 and resembles Neobeliscus in having the retractor muscle of the 

 penis inserted upon the right ocular band (instead of upon the dia- 

 phragm, as usual in land snails), and as in Neohelvicus the albumen 

 gland is reduced to very small proportions. The separation of 

 the male and female ducts clearly indicates that Atopocochlis is 

 viviparous, like Neobeliscus, although no information is given by 

 Furtado upon this point. The podocyst described in embryos of 

 Neobeliscus is similar to that of Achutina. These facts indicate 

 that the South American genus has its nearest existing allies in 

 West African genera, and accordingly modify the general conclu- 

 sions set forth in his former paper.

CBTTSTACEA AND PYCNOGONIDA COLLECTED DURING THE PRINCETON 

 EXPEDITION TO NORTH GREENLAND. 



BY DR. A. E. ORTMANN. 



A preliminary but uot quite complete list of the species collected 

 during the Princeton Expedition to North Greenland (Peary 

 Auxiliary Expedition, 1899) has been published in The Princeton 

 Bulletin, Vol. 11, No. 3, February, 1900, pp. 38-40 ; in the 

 same periodical, Vol. 11, No. 2, December, 1899, pp. 25-2fi, a list 

 of stations has been giv^en. It seems hardly necessary to repeat this 

 list here, since under each species not only the number of the 

 station, but also the location of the latter and the depth is given. 



Most of the localities are situated on the coast of North Green- 

 land, between Cape York and Foulke Fjords (ca. 76-79° N. L. ); 

 a few are situated on the opposite side of Smith Sound (Ellesmere 

 Land, Payer Harbor) ; the rest is farther south, on the coast of 

 West Greenland (Upernavik, Waigat Channel, and Godhavn, 

 Disco Island), and the coast of Labrador (Domino Run and 

 Battle Harbor). 



Only a few expeditions have previously collected material in these 

 parts (North- water of Baffin Bay, Smith Sound and Grinnell 

 Land). The following reports on Crustacea have been pub- 

 lished:

The collections described here have been made by Prof. William

 larger beim-trawl, surface and dip nets. Since the chief value of 

 the material collected lies on the zoogeographical side, I shall take 

 particular pains to give an account of the previously known facts 

 of distribution in every species.

 by Buchholz' is ditierent from this species. But, a-s Hoek points 

 out,' and Koelbel confirms,* the diflferences of Buchholz's figure 

 from this species are due to inaccuracies in the drawing. That 

 the drawing in fig. 1 is incorrect, especially as regards the last

 Buchholz gives, in fig. 1/i, a correct reproduction of the last

This species differs from C. septentrionalis, (1) in the lack of 

 tubercles on the anterior part of the body; (2) in the arm of the 

 second pair of legs, which is longer; (3) in the reddish color 

 (they were found in red algne). 



Although there are no males, I believe, we have to deal here 

 with C. linearis. C. septentrionalis grows much larger, and my 

 females with eggs are small, much smaller than ovigerous females 

 of C septentrionalis. Among the young C. septentrionalis from

The large amount of material at hand enables me to pronounce 

 A. baffini and feildeni varieties, of one and the same species. We 

 possess both forms, and the var. feildeni prevails for instance at 

 Station 40, and is represented at Station 49. But, besides, there 

 are many intermediate specimens in the different hauls, especially 

 in Nos. 40, 49 and 51. 



Miers found his feildeni under the same conditions, associated 

 with the typical form. Benedict's and Sars' material consisted 

 only of a few individuals of each form. 



Very young individu.als are always withouc spines, and thus 

 young individuals always belong to the var. feildeni, although their 

 mother, to whose antennre they cling, may be a true baffini. In 

 larger individuals the spiues are developed in a different degree.

and there are all intermediate stages between the strongly spinous 

 A. baffini and the almost smooth A. feildeni.

 20, p. 14, PI. 3, fig. 1, in the year 1877; but since this volume

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Feb., 



In the wanting tubercles of the dorsal surface and the form 

 of the lateral angulations, this species is related to the two species 

 of the genus known from the North Pa- 

 cific, and the form of the pleon recalls that 

 of J. erostrata Rich. (Aleutian Islands). 

 But it differs (1) in the presence of a 

 long rostrum, (2) in the stronger develop- 

 ment of the lateral angulations of the head, 

 (3) in the slightly different angulations of 

 the second and third segments of the 

 pereiou. 



The generic name Tole has been given 

 to replace Janthe Bovallius nom. prreoccup. 

 (1865 Mars, 1867 Stal). (Type, J. spe- 

 e.iosn Bov. = spinosa Harg. ) 



The following key to the species of 

 Tole = Janthe may serve to express the 

 affinities of our new species: 



«'. — Pleon produced backward into two 

 large angulations, between which 

 the uropods are inserted (6). 

 a". — Pleon produced into one small me- 

 dian extension, on each side of 

 which there are incisions for the 

 insertion of the uropods. (Rostrum very short. Two lat- 

 eral angulations of the head. Segments of pereion each 

 with one median, obtuse tuliercle, ./. bovaliiil Studev))." 



East Patagonia. 



// . — Segments of pereion dorsally with spines or tubercles (c). 

 //'. — Segments of pereion dorsally smooth id). 

 c'. — Segments of pereiou dorsally each with two submedian, short, 

 spine-like tubercles. First segment with one, second to 

 fourth with two large angulations, fifth to seventh with 

 one large and one (posterior) small angulation,

The ovigerous male of Station 39 agrees in aU essential points 

 with P. lusplda as figured by Wilson. The two females, however, 

 show the chelae of the mandibles (antenuie) as figured by Wilson 

 for P. discoidea (1880, fig. 106), and the rostrum is more obtuse 

 than in the male, which is another diagnostic character assigned 

 to discoidea. In the shape of the end of the abdomen I do not 

 find any difference; all thi-ee iadi\'iduals have it obtuse, and not 

 pointed and slightly bifid. 



In my opinion P. hiqmhi is not different from discoidea, but 

 represents merely the male sex.

ECHINODEEMS COLLECTED OFF THE WEST COAST OF GREENLAND BY 

 THE PKINCETON ARCTIC EXPEDITION OF 1899. 



BY WALTER M. RANKIN. 



The following Echinoderms were collected by the Princeton 

 Arctic Expedition of 1899. 



In compiling the list I have eodeavored to give, in addition to 

 the identification of the species, some notes on the specimens — 

 their number, locality and peculiarities, together with a tabulation 

 of the distribution of the species in area and depth. 



I have not attempted to give a complete synonomy of the species, 

 but merely to quote the original author and, ordinarily, the refer- 

 ence where a more complete description or figure of the species may 

 be found.

 Iceland, North Cape, Spitzbergen, Kara Sea, north coast of Ala.ska. 

 " The form discovered by Ayres at San Francisco may perhaps 

 be C. californica, a closely allied species " (Ludwig). 



Ludwig, in Fauna Ardica, Bd. 1, pp. 142, 143 (1900), gives 

 the distribution as a two-thirds circumpolar, the species being still 

 unrepresented in the north Asian region, from 70° E. L. to 170° 

 W. L. North and south its extreme points of distribution are,

Florida reefs, 24° N. L. on the west, and Plj'mouth, England, 



50° N. L. on the east of the Atlantic, to Spitzbergen, 80° N. L. 



Its vertical distribution ranges from to 220 fathoms on the 



west coast of Iceland. The usual depth is from 3 to 30 fathoms.

As CufMmaria frondosa, this also is a two-thirds circum[,olar 

 form, being absent in the north Asian region, 71° E. L. to 170° 

 W. L., and in the North American, 156° W. L. to 95° W. L. 



It is a strictly Arctic form, its extreme points of distribution

The series of 101 specimens, ranging from 5 mm. to 58 mm. in 

 •diameter, shows considerable variation among themselves and from 

 the typical form, as has been noted by Duncan and Sladen in 

 their report on the Echinoderms of the Nares Expedition.' The 

 height in two specimens of approximately the same diameter may 

 differ by as much as 10 mm. — as 55 : 35 and 52 : 25 mm. 



The specimens on the whole are more depressed than specimens 

 of similar size collected on the Massachusetts coast, and the spines 

 are shorter and less numerous, the cleaned test showing only com- 

 paratively few large tubercles. 



Distribution. — Numerous stations on the west coast of Green- 

 land: Discovery Bay (Nares Ex.), Assistance Bay (Penny's 

 voyage) ; Great Britain, Scandinavia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, 

 north coast of Siberia, Ochotsk Sea, Kamschatka, Bering 

 Strait. 



An Arctic and Sub-Arctic form, extending as far south on the 

 North American coast as off Chesapeake Bay. A circumpolar 

 form, being found both in the north Atlantic and north Pacific. 

 Its extreme depth is given by Verrill as G40 fathoms.

This single fine specimen corresponds very closely to the descrip- 

 tion given by Danielssen and Koren. The size is slightly larger 

 than the type, diam. 3tiO:330 mm., diam. of disk 54:52 mm. 

 There are some minor diflferences. as follows : The five rows of spines 

 on aboral surface of the rays are not so regularly arranged and 

 the middle ones are not higher than the lateral. At the sides of 



' Challenger Report. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 173 



the rays the spines seem to be less regular in their arrangement; 

 both the dorso- and ventral -laterals are about thirty in number. 

 The rectiform pedicellariie are similar to the type (I. c, PI. 11, figs. 

 3 and 4). Those near the dorsal spines are smaller than those 

 round the lateral. The cruciform pedicellarise, however, seem to 

 diflfer, being somewhat longer than in the type, and the jaws more 

 convex on their outer surfaces. At the biting tip are two very 

 large, sharp teeth and smaller, scattered teeth are on the concave 

 surface. These cruciform pedicellariie form verj' prominent 

 clusters around the two lateral rows of spines. 



The species was found originally by its authors in Advent Bay, 

 Spitzbergen, at a depth of liO fathoms, and they also rejjort two 

 specimens from the Kara Sea as a variety of A. gunneri. 



This is the first recorded specimen from Greenland waters. The 

 color in the living state corresponds, Dr. Ortmann tells me, to the 

 description giveji by Dauielssen and Keren, ' ' deep red on the 

 aboral surface, whity-yellow on the oral surface." The present 

 alcohohc specimen is yellowish-brown.

Of the specimens collected all are 10-rayed, thus differing from

The two specimens from Station 49 have an extreme diameter of

80 and 68 mm. respective!}-, and the proportion of the radii is as 

 two to one. Tlie rays are broader at the base and more tapering 

 than the typical form. As to the adambulacral armature, there 

 are five or six spines in each plate of the longitudinal series and 

 six in the transverse; the former are somewhat webbed at the base. 



From Station 39 one specimen resembles very closely the larger 

 one from Station 49. The other two (60 and 80 mm. in diameter 

 respectivelj') have longer, more slender and less tapering rays; iu 

 this respect coming closer to the typical C. papposus, the proportions 

 of the radii being about 2^-2^ to 1. The longitudinal series of 

 adambulacral plates have each three or four spines to a plate, and 

 the transverse series five spines. In all five specimens the paxillse 

 have longer, more numerous and more divergent spines than does 

 the typical form. 



Danielssen and Koren (l. c, p. 44) discuss the relation of Solas- 

 ter affinis (Brandt) to Crossasfer (Sola/iter) pajjposus, and Sladen 

 {I. c, p. 41) describes a form from the Faroe Islands which he 

 calls variety septentrionalis of C. papposus, while Duncan and 

 Sladen, in the report of the Echinoderms of the Nares Esi>edition,* 

 mention the variations from the type form in their specimens of C. 

 papposus. The present specimens agree with these cited descriptions 

 in the number of the rays (10), but otherwise there are minor 

 deviations from them all. I am inclined to think that all are 

 merely local varieties of an extremely variable species.

Carpenter {I. c, supra, pp. 136ff. ) discusses at length the species 

 of Antedon belonging to the Eschrichti group of Comatulce, and 

 gives a complete syuonomy of the two species, eschrichti and 

 (jiuidrata. I find the differences in the material collected by this 

 expedition to be very slight; but there are five specimens from 

 Granville Bay which seem to belong to Carpenter's quadrata. 

 Dr. Ortmann tells me that in life there is a distinct difierence in 

 their appearance, but this is less evident in the alcoholic material. 

 The color of qxiadrata is lighter and the arms have a less feathery 

 appearance, due to the slightly greater length of the arm-joints 

 and the consequently greater distance between the pinnules. The 

 character, however, of quadrata to which Carpenter gives special 

 weight — i.e., the shorter third pinnule as compared with the second 

 — I cannot find at all well marked, though its joints seem, as Car- 

 penter says, to be slightly longer than those of tlie same pinnule in 

 eschrichii. 



According to Carpenter the two species are widely distributed 

 through the Arctic Ocean. Eschrichti reaches, in Smitli's Sound, 

 79° N. lat., and quadrata, 81°. 



Both wore obtained by the Challenger Expedition as far south 

 as off Halifax, at a depth of 51 fathoms. Eschrichti was found by 

 the " Vega " as far east as long. 92° 20' E. 



In depth eschrichti has been dredged from 632 fathoms, quadrata 

 from 466 fathoms.

Of these nineteen species it will be observed that two, Asterias 

 polaris and Ophiopholis acideata, are not strictly to be reckoned 

 with the others as they were collected in more southern stations — 

 the former off the coast of Labrador and off Disco, the latter in 

 Battle Harbor, Labrador. The other species are all from between 

 lat. 76° and 79° N., though some species were also found at the 

 more southern stations. 



The Arctic Echinoderm fauua has been examined with care, 

 and it was hardly to be expected that any new species would be 

 added to the list of those already known. It is interesting, how- 

 ever, to note at least a new distribution, for Asterias gunneri has 

 before this, I believe, never been recorded from Greenland waters. 



A comparison is naturally suggested between this list and that of 

 the collection made by Capt. Nares, of the ' ' Alert ' ' and ' ' Dis- 

 cover)'," in 1875-6 from the same region, and published by Dun- 

 can and Sladen in the Annals of Natural History ( IV), Vol. XX, 

 1877. 



We have in addition to that list one Holothurid, M. rinkii, and 

 two Asterids, Asterias gunneri and Cribrella oculata ; while in the 

 Princeton collection Asteracanthion {Pedicellaster) palceoerystallus, 

 Sokister forcifer, Ophioglypha struwitzii and Astrophyton arcticum 

 (a deep-water form) of the Nares collection are not represented. 



Of the nineteen species in the Princeton coLection, all but Aste- 

 rias polaris are more or less widely distributed in both American 

 and European Arctic seas. 



Increased knowledge of the distribution of Arctic Echinoderma 

 seems to increase the probability that they are nearly all circum- 

 polar and not coutined to local areas.

NEW MARINE MOLLTJSKS. 

 BY EDWARD G. VANATTA. 



The species herein described were encountered in determining 

 material for the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia. 

 Haminea zanzibarica n. sp. PI. V, fig. 12. 



Shell large, subglobose, thin, shining, translucent, pinkish 

 white, slightly orange-tinted at the vertex and the base. The sur- 

 face is covered with very close microscopic wavy spiral strise, 

 longitudinally iri-egularly coarsely wrinkled, sometimes with several 

 angular spiral ridges caused by spiral malleation. Vertex im- 

 pressed, imperforate, whitened by an internal thickening of the 

 shell. The aperture is narrow above, ample below. The right lip 

 rises from the left side of the apical depression. Parietal callus 

 very thin. The columellar lip is evenly concave, broadly reflexed, 

 and the edge is not adnate except at the upper end, forming a 

 crescent-shaped free plate over the axial region. 



Alt. 20, diam. 14 mm. 



Alt. 21, diam. 15.5 mm. 



Locality. — Zanzibar. 



The type is in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Pliiladelphia, No. 57,552. 



Tiiis species may easily be distinguished from H. zelandicB Gray 

 by its less globular form, less convex parietal wall and the micro- 

 scopic waved spiral strire and free edge of the columellar callus. 

 This species is larger than H. nalalemis Krauss, and the right lip 

 does not rise so high above the vertex. The spiral malleation is 

 similar to that of Limnwa palustris. 

 Haminea suooinea var. solidior n. PI. V, fig. 8. 



Shell solid, imperforate, finely wave striate, color waxen white. 



This variety may be easily distinguished from the typical H. 

 mcciiiea Conr. by being heavier and smaller. 



Alt. 7, diam. 3 mm.

Locality.— St. Martin and St. Bartholomew, West Indies, and 

 Progreso, Yucatan. 



The type is in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sci- 

 ences of Philadelphia, No. 57,900, coUected by Dr. B. Sharp at 

 St. Martin. 



Atys sharpi n. sp. PI. V, fig. 9. 



Shell small, subcylindrical, solid, porcellanous, glossy, translu- 

 cent bluish white, very finely spirally striate, stri» strongest above 

 and below. Apex with an extremely small perforation. Base 

 umbilicate. Aperture narrow above, broader below. The lip rises 

 from the right side of the apical perforation and describes a more 

 or less even arc above without the twist so common in this genus; 

 the outer lip descends in a gentle curve and the basal lip is arcu- 

 ate. The columella is concave with a slight twist. 



Alt. 7.84, diam. 3.8 mm. 



Locality. — St. Martin, West Indie?. 



Types in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia, No. 60,73.5, collected by Dr. B. Sharp. 



This species '"s easily recognized by the lack of a twist on the 

 evenly curved upper part of the lip. 



Tornatina bermudenais n. sp. PI. V, figs. 6, 7. 



Shell small, cylindrical, porcellanous, shining bluish white, 

 smooth. The spire is composed of about three whorls, the first 

 being turned up forms a large tubercle, the other two are round- 

 shouldered. The suture is a very slightly impressed canal, body 

 whorl descending in front. The aperture is nearly four-fifths the 

 entire length of the shell, narrow above and broader below, upper 

 part of aperture with a deep wide sutural notch, parietal wall 

 and columella covered by a very heavy callus, no columellar fold. 

 The base is squarely truncate and receding. 



Alt. 2.87, diam. 1.41 mm. 



Locality. — Bermuda. 



Type in the coUectiou of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, No. 70,160, collected by Prof. Angelo Heilprin. 



This species may be distinguished from T. canalkulata and T. 

 decurrens V. and B. by its heavy parietal callus and the lack of 

 a columellar fold. 




184 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Lnoina (Divaricella) daliiana n. sp. PI. V. flgs. 10, 11. 



Shell almost circular, somewhat truncate po.steriorly, nearly 

 equilateral, moderately convex, shining white, porcellanous, sur- 

 face sculpture divaricale; in full-grown examples there is a smooth 

 band where the diverging lines would meet. The beaks aie 

 slightly raised above the hinge line, directed forward and located 

 hardly in advance of the centre; they are sculptured with micro- 

 scopic concentric strire only which are worn ofi iu the largest speci- 

 men we have. The lunule is about one-eighth the length of the 

 shell The anterior area under the lunule is not distinctly marked. 

 The groove of the ligament is long and narrow. The margin 

 has the interior layer very finely crcnulate, but the outer layer 

 smooth. The hinge of the right valve is provided with a heavy 

 cardinal tooth with a pit on each side, and a single tubercular 

 anterior and posterior lateral, the posterior one being about twice as 

 far from the beak as the anterior one. The muscle scars are of 

 moderate size, the anterior one being long and narrow, while the 

 posterior one is more elliptical. 



Alt. 19, diam. 20, thickness of right valve 4.5 mm. 



Alt. 21, diam. 22. -5, thickness of right valve 5.5 mm. 



Locality. — In ballast from South Africa. 



Types in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, No. 79,380, collected by Mr. J. G. INIalone. 



This species is distinguished from L. dentaia Wood by not 

 having the outer layer of the margin heavily deulate; from L. 

 cumingii A. and A. in having the diverging sculpture extending 

 across the anterior area to the lunule, and the inner layer of the 

 margin is crenulate; from L. quadrisulcufa Orb. in having a smooth 

 band where the diverging lines would meet in full-grown examples; 

 from L. Imttoniana n. sp. in having the inner layer of the margin 

 crenulate, and in the smooth baud. 

 Lnoina (Divaricella) huttoniana n. sp. PI. V, figs. 14, 1-5. 



Shell almost circular, posterior extremity squarely truncate, 

 nearly equilateral, bluish white with white concentric streaks, 

 glossy, porcellanous, surface sculpture divaricate, the diverging 

 sculpture extending to the edge of the comparatively broad ante- 

 rior area below the lunule. The beaks are slightly raised above 

 the hinge line, directed forward, located slightly in advance of 

 the centre, sculptured with rather coarse close concentric costelhe 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 185 



only. The lunule is very narrow, beginning as a broad impres- 

 sion under the beak and tapers forward, ending in a shallow point 

 just above the anterior lateral tooth of the hinge. The anterior 

 area under the luuule is strongly defined by the termination of 

 the diverging lines, and is sculptured with in-egular rough concentric 

 strise with more or less yellow epidermis in the iutei-stices. The 

 groove of the ligament is bounded on the inner side by a ridge 

 which begins as an angle near the beak and gradually becomes 

 higher to a point about four millimeters from the end of the hinge 

 line, then suddenly descends almost lo the end of the hinge line. 

 The inner margin of the shell is smooth, neither layer being crenu- 

 late. The hinge of the right valve has a large hea\7' cardinal tooth 

 in the centre, with a deep pit on each side and a smaller cardinal in 

 front directed forward. The anterior lateral is a large tubercle 

 with a deep chink where the adductor muscle truncates it; there is 

 scarcely any trace of a tubercle at the posterior end of the hinge. 

 The left valve has the pits for the corresponding cardinals of the 

 right valve and a rather large posterior cardinal, an anterior lateral 

 like the other valve and no posterior lateral. The anterior adduc- 

 tor muscle scar is very long and narrow, while the posterior scar is 

 short oval. 



Alt. 29.5, diam. 32, thickness of right valve 8 mm. 



Locality. — Auckland, New Zealand. 



Types in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, No. 63,758. 



This species differs from L. dentata Wood in lacking the dentate 

 margin, from L. quadrisulcata Orb. in lacking the crenulate 

 margin. It is distinguished from L. cvmhvjii xVd. and Ang. by 

 having a long narrow lunule, more delicate texture and lower beaks; 

 it is also much less globose. 



Venus (Anomalocardia) malonei n. sp. PI. V, figs, i, 5. 



Shell triangular, posteriorly rostrate, moderately convex, longer 

 than high, solid. The color is variable: some specimens are 

 creamy white with irregular transve'-se zigzag brown spots or 

 stripes, some are almost entirely dark brown, and others are light 

 brown with a few very light radial bands and dark-brown 

 blotches. The interior is generally purple, shading into a white 

 margin with a brown band within the pallial line, but some lack 

 the white margin. Sculpture both concentric and radial. The 




186 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



radial ribs predominate at each end, while the .concentric sculpture 

 is strongest in the middle of the valve. Anteriorly the first eight 

 radial ribs are prominent and densely granulose : the median por- 

 tions of the valves are regularly concentrically costate and radially 

 ribbed, with finer closely packed costse prominent in the interstices; 

 the concentric costte are cut into even granules by the crossing 

 radial costse ; at the posterior angle of the valve there are about 

 five or six prominent heavy squamose radial ribs; from this point 

 the radial ribs predominate, and gradually become finer to the pos- 

 terior margin. Beaks prominent, directed forward, smooth, 

 except a few concentric growth lines. Lunula impressed, a little 

 convex, narrow, about one-fourth the length of Ihe shell, generally 

 of a darker color than the rest of the shell and provided with si.'i 

 or eight longitudinal granulose ribs. The groove of the ligament 

 is lineal', tapering at the extremities. The margin is dorsally quite 

 evenly arcuate; rounded anteriorly, a trifle convex at the lunule; 

 evenly arcuate ventraliy; posterior obliquely truncate, with a very 

 blunt obtuse angle near the centre. The margin is very finely 

 crenulate ; beginning at the anterior side of the beak it is minutely 

 crenulate along the edge of the lunule, becoming coarser ven- 

 traliy, then gradually becoming finer, and ends abnii^tly at the 

 posterior eud of the ligament. The hinge is broad under the con- 

 vex lunule, narrower posteriorly, with three teeth in each valve. 

 The right valve has the anterior tooth small, lamellar and nearly 

 parallel with lunule; the middle tooth is triangular and directed 

 forward, its posterior end is nearly vertical, while the anterior end 

 is oblique and almost parallel to the anterior tooth; posterior tooth 

 large, about the size of the triangular central, slightly bifid or 

 grooved at the summit, directed backward. The left valve is three- 

 toothed, anterior tooth lamellar, higher than the rest, directed 

 forward; central nearly lamellar, vertical, with a bifid or grooved 

 summit; posterior small, lamellar, directed obliquely backward, 

 with a pointed summit. The adductor muscle scars of nearly 

 equal size, palhal line evenly arched, with a moderately deep pallial 

 sinus. Alt. 15, diam. 21, diam. 9 mm. 



Locality. — In ballast from South Africa.

and less rostrate, also in having a predominance of concentric 

 sculpture in the median portion of the valve; the posterior end 

 radially closely ribbed, narrower lunule and much finer crenula- 

 tion of the ventral margin. The creuulation of the margins inside 

 is much like V. marica.

KEW SPECIES OF MOLLUSKS FROM SOUTH AFRICA AND BURMA. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The Academy has received from the Rev. H. W. Winkley good 

 series of an AmpuUnria and a Vivipam from Henzada, Burma, 

 which though without striking features do not seem referable to 

 any of the numerous described species.' 



Vivipara henzadensis n. sp. PI. V, fig. 1. 



Shell umbilicate, broadly ovate-conic; olive-green with some 

 narrow sligbtly darker streaks; surface glossy and smooth, under 

 a lens showing fine, delicate and spaced spiral stria;, which become 

 crowded and somewhat granulose on the base. Spii-e short, obtuse, 

 the earlier whorls eroded, the eroded portion reddish, tipped with 

 black. Sutures deeply impressed, the whorls strongly swollen just 

 below them; last whorl angular at the peripherj' in front, the 

 angle disappearing on the last half whorl, which is rounded; 

 umbilicus narrow, excavated behind the columellar lip, sur- 

 rounded by an angle. Aperture oblique, rounded-ovate, bluish 

 white inside; peristome narrowly expanded at the edge, blunt, 

 black, with a blackish border inside and out; continuous across the 

 parietal margin. 



Alt. 23, diam. 10J-17i mm. 



Operculum chestnut-brown and slightly wrinkled outside, with a 

 conspicuous raised or reflexed cuticular border; inside with a con- 

 spicuously raised and minutely roughened ovate area nearer the 

 columellar side, radiating strire on the outside of this area, and a 

 raised border all around. 



This species closely resembles the African T'. heliciformis Fild. 

 in form and color. It belongs, however, to a group of south- 



' From Cochin China and neighboring countries Fischer enumerates no 

 less than fifteen species of AmpnlUma and thirty-eight of Paludina, in his 

 useful Cntidixjye et Distribution Geographiqve den Moll, terr., fli/o. et

eastern Asia in which the operculum is peculiarly modified, as 

 described above. This subgeneric group I propose to call Idio- 

 poma, the above-described species being the type. 



Ampullaria Winkleyi n. sp, PI. V, figs. 2. 3. 



Shell narrowly umbilicate, globose ; yellowish-olive, uniform or 

 with few or numerous dusky olive spiral bands, the earlier whorls 

 eroded, blackish or ruddy. Surface smooth, somewhat shining, 

 under a strong lens seen to be very densely, microscopically striated 

 spirally, the strise minutely granulose; spire low-conic; sutures 

 impressed, the whorls flattened below them, elsewhere symmetrically 

 convex. Aperture vertical, .semi-rotund, narrower above, reddish- 

 tawny and sometimes banded within, becoming white near the lip; 

 peristome a trifle expanded below, white or dirty yellowish, the 

 outer margin equably curved, columella concave, blunt and more 

 or less thickened but not reflexed. parietal callus rather thin, 

 white, thinner within. 



Alt. 58, diam. 50, longest axis of aperture 43 mm. 



Operculum (fig. .3) thick and solid, concave externally, and 

 partially covered with a thin, yellowish-brown cuticle. Inside 

 bluish, with a mica-like gleam, the scar of attachment sunken, the 

 columellar side concentrically striate, the enclosed eminence nar- 

 row, curved and smooth. 



Henzada, Burma. Tvpes No. 76,011, Coll. Acad. Nat. Sci. 

 Phila. 



It is somewhat allied to A. Begini Morlet. 



Sonax Bertini n. sp. 



Shell long and narrow, the height contained about 2^ times in the 

 length, thin, polished, the color varying from pure white through 

 various tints of pink to purple ; beaks situated at the posterior 

 third of the length ; anterior end rounded, posterior end obliquely 

 tnmcate, rounded at the extremity ; the upper margin anterior to 

 the beaks straight, basal margin but slightly curved ; ridge defining 

 the posterior area rounded. Surface sculptured with slight growth 

 wrinkles, and faintly showing some fine radial strife, which, how- 

 ever, are almost completely obsolete, though plainly visible by 

 looking through the shell, except near the anterior en<l; the pos- 

 terior area is sculptured with deep oblique grooves, the summits of the 

 intervening ridges cut by finer radial striae. Interior smooth or 




190 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



radially striate; pallial sinus extending nearly to the middle of the 

 shell's length; the margin finely crenate. 



Length 15.5, all. 6, diam 4.5 mm. 



Found by Mr. J. G. Malone in ballast from South Africa. 



Types are No. 79,532, Coll. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. 



This species is somewhat allied to D. Oweni Gray, but the beaks 

 are nearer the posterior end, the valves are not keeled ; the poste- 

 rior costulation extends further, and between and upon the riblets 

 fine radial striae are conspicuous ; finally, the basal margin is finely 

 and strongly crenulated inside and the shell is smaller. 



It is named in honor of M. Victor Bertin, whose excellent 

 Revision des Donacidees (1881) and various other papers on 

 bivalves give evidence of a well -trained and acute mind, unfor- 

 tunately lost to science by death at the beginning of a useful 

 career. 



The following species of Donax occurred with D. Bertini: D. 

 Madagascanensis Wood, D. bipartitus Sowb., D. spiculum Rve., D. 

 ErythrcEensis Bertin. 



Fossarus oapensis n. sp- PI- V, fig. 13. 



Shell perforate, turbinate, white, the last whorl encircled by 

 three very strong, compressed, flange-like keels, the largest peri- 

 pheral in position, the smallest surrounding the columellar region, 

 another of intermediate size between tliese two. Surface irregu- 

 larly striatulate, with some lamellar riblets toward the aperture; 

 densely spirally striate, especially between the keels. Spire acute; 

 whorls about (\, the last three showing the peripheral keel above 

 the sutures. Aperture semicircular, the peristome continuous, 

 notched at the terminations of the keels. 



Alt. 6, diam. 4 mm. 



In ballast from South Africa. 



Type in Coll. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., No. 79,820.

NEW MOLLTJSCA FROM JAPAN, THE LOO CHOO ISLANDS, FORMOSA AND 

 THE PHILIPPINES. 



BY HEKRY A. PILSBP.Y. 



The discovery of the major portion of the species herein defined 

 is due to the untiring industry of Mr. Y. Hirase, of Kyoto, 

 Japan, whose researches bid fair to surpass those of any previous 

 naturalist in the extent of his additions to our knowledge of the 

 Japanese molluscan fauna. 



Illustrations of the following species will accompany a contin- 

 uation of this f)aper, now in preparation. 



HELICID^. 

 Eulota suooincta var. amblytropis n. 



Differs from surcinctd in havins: the peripheral keel obsolete on 

 the latter part of the last whorl, which is quite rounded. Pale 

 yellowish, with a dark reddish-chestnut peripheral band, and two 

 somewhat lighter reddish bands, one above, the other wider, mid- 

 way between periphery and umbilicus. Surface rather smoother 

 than in suecincta.

Alt. 14, diam. 21 mm. 



Formosa. Coll. A. N. S. P. (No. 78,187), and Univ. of 

 Michigan. 

 Enlota Sargentiana n. sp. 



Shell narrowly umbilicate, globose-turbinate, rather thin, 

 slightly shining; light yellowish brown with a narrow red-brown 

 band or line at the periphery, and reddish within the umbihcus. 

 Spire elevated, conic, the apex acute; whorls 6, somewhat convex, 

 slowly increasing, the last angular at the periphery in front, becom- 

 ing rounded on the latter half, rather swollen below, but distinctly 

 flattened around the umbilicus, especially just behind the basal 

 lip. Aperture quite oblique, irregularly lunate ; peristome thin, 




194 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



distinctly though narrowly expanded, the basal lip straightened, 

 reflexed ; rather suddenly dilated at the columellar insertion, half 

 covering the umbilicus; parietal callus scarcely perceptible. 



Alt. 22, diam. 28 ram. 



Formosa. Coll. A. N. S. P. (No. 78,188), and Univ. of 

 Michigan. 



This species belongs to the group of E. succincta, differing from 

 that form in the more globose and conic shell, rather acute spire, 

 and straisrhtened basal lip. It is named in honor of Mr. H. E. 

 Sargent, the efficient curator of the museum of the University of 

 Michigan. 



ZONITID^. 

 Lamprocystis spadix S and B., var. cinctus n. v. 



Shell white, with a supraperipheral red-brown baud. Formosa 

 (J. B. Steere).' Numerous examples of the typical i. «/ja(iu were 

 also taken by I\Ir. Steere. 



Vitrinoconus Moellendorffi n. sp. 



Shell high-conic, thin, light brown; rather strongly but irregu- 

 larly striate, the strife slightly arcuate, weaker beneath and dis- 

 appearing on the early whorls; outlines of the spire almost straight, 

 the apex obtuse. Whorls 9, very slowly increasing, very slightly 

 convex, the sutures filled by a seam-like cord; last whorl acutely 

 keeled, the keel compressed, projecting; base slightlj' convex. 

 Umbilicus contained .3^; times in the total diameter of the shell, 

 well-like, with flattened sides, bordered by a projecting and com- 

 pressed cord-like keel. Aperture oblique, small: acutely angular 

 at the position of the peripheral keel, and emarginate where the 

 umbilical keel terminates; the basal margin arcuate; peristome 

 perceptibly thickened, the outer lip simple, basal and columellar 

 margins a little expanded. 



Alt. 7.7, diam. 10 mm.; umbilicus 3 mm. 



Alt. 8.2, diam. 10 mm.; umbilicus 3 mm. 



Panay, Philippines (J. B. Steere Exped. ). 



This species belongs to the "group of V. cijathcllus" in Dr. 

 \on Mdllendorfi's excellent arrangement of the genus (Semper's 

 Rcisen, VIII, p. 42), and to the first division of that group in 

 von Mollendorffs key, which to accommodate this species may be 

 supplemented thus:

V. Moellendorffi. 

 Besides the differences between Moellendorffi and omphalotropis 

 given in the above table, the former has the base decidedly more 

 flattened. 



SUCCINEID^. 

 Snccinea ogasawarae n. sp. 



Shell short and broad for the genus, squarish-oblong; very tliin 

 translucent and corneous with whitish streaks and clouds, rather 

 coarsely wrinkled in harmony with the lines of growth. Spire 

 excessively short, obtuse, flattened above, there being barely two 

 whorls separated by a comma-shaped suture; the last whorl quite 

 convex, its earlier portion very convex. Aperture very lar<^e 

 eleven-twelfths the greatest length of the shell, very broadly ovate 

 in form. Greatest length of shell (measured obliquely to the 

 axis) 12.5, greatest width (measured at right angles to preceding) 

 8.5; convexity 4.8; longest axis of aperture 11.5, width ^ mm 

 Ogaaawara (Boniu) Islands (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 617a). " 

 A remarkable species, in which the spire is reduced to a mere 

 papilla, and the last whorl is large and convex. If the measure- 

 ments were taken in the conventional manner, the diameter would 

 about equal the altitude, hut in a species so oblique in two planes 

 as this one, I have preferred to give measurements not involving 

 the direction of the coluraellar axis. 

 Suooinea punotnlispira n. sp. 



Shell ovate, very thin and fragile, pale yellow, subtransluceut, 

 the spire sometimes slightly tinted with red; sculpture of moder-

 of the last whorl minutely and densely punctate, the pits arranged 

 in spiral series. Spire rather short and conically projecting, com- 

 posed of 2i whorls, the first one very convex; last whorl convex, 

 dUtinctly dilated or bell-shaped at the mouth. Aperture regularly 

 ovate, the outer hp evenly curved, columellar lip simple and

Ogasawara, or Bonin, Islands (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 6176.). 



I am no enthu.<iast on the subject of specific differentiation in 

 the genus Succinea, but the two species described above differ from 

 those previously known so strongly that they become of some 

 interest. It is questionable whether these species are of common 

 ancestry with S. lauta or S. horticola, the two Japanese Sucdneas. 

 I incline to the view that they have no direct relationship. 



Some years ago, the Abbe A. Vathelet gave me specimens of 

 Succinea lauta under the name " S. Vatheleti Mabille." I do not 

 know that this supposed new species has been published.

Shell short-fusiform, solid, yellow or orange- yellow, typically with 

 asubsutural white band irregularly marked with black-brown or red- 

 brown, the slender lower portion of the base also whitish with dark 

 or reddish dots or stripes; two white lines or girdles likewise dark- 

 dotted upon the intermediate part of the last whorl; but sometimes 

 the dark markings are faint or in part wanting. Surface glossy, 

 sculptured with very short longitudinal folds above, scarcely 

 reaching the suture and not extending below the periphery; the 

 folds on the spire becoming weak at both sutures. Base spirally 

 lirate. "Whorls about 6i. Aperture rather narrow, the outer lip 

 thick and furnished with a series of short folds within; columella 

 smooth. Length 11, diam. 5.3, length of aperture 5.5 mm.

This pretty little Columbella has fared ill in the matter of names, 

 as the references above l>ear witness. It is closely related to the true 

 C. misera of Sowerby, l)ut that species has stronger folds, especially 

 those upon the spire, and a white or nearly white ground-color 

 profusely marked with blackish-brown, the summit of each fold 

 having a vertical line or a spot of that shade. In C. polynyma 

 the folds are weaker, and the color-scheme quite ditferent. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 197 



C. misera was taken in some numbers by Mr. F. Stearns at 

 . Kamakura, prov. Sagami. The specimens vary from completely 

 typical to a broader form. The habitat of the type was-unknown, 

 but from the exact agreement of Japanese examples with the 

 original figure, it may not unlikely have been from Japan. I 

 know of no other positive locality for the species. 



Prof, von Martens has quoted the figures of C. miger Duclos 

 in Chenu, Illust. ConchjL, PI. 21, figs. 13-16, as representing his 

 C. japonim; but these figures show the characteristic spots on the 

 ribs of C. inkeni, and in my opinion do not represent any form of 

 the present species. 



BUCCINIDJE. 

 Chrysodomus intersculptus var. frater n. 



Shell differing from C. intersculptm Sovfh.' in having fewer and 

 comparatively stronger spiral ribs, the intervals densely and finely 

 striate spirally, the anterior canal longer, more slender, with no 

 appearance of a siphona) funicle. Length 84, diam. 45, length 

 of aperture 50 mm. 



Kizennuma, prov. Rikuzen (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



Typical C. iniersculptm comes from the west coast of the main 

 island. This form probably replaces it on the east or ocean coast. 



PASCIOLARIIDiE. 

 Peristernia ustulata var. luchuana n. 



Similar in form and sculpture to P. udulata (Rve) from the 

 Fiji Islands, but with fewer and larger longitudinal folds, 7 on the 

 last whorl; fleshy bufl', usually with a brown spot in each interval 

 at the periphery, the aperture yellow and lirate within, the end of 

 the anterior canal blackish purple. Columella with two folds, 

 stronger than in P. ustulata. Length 28, diam. 12, length of 

 aperture 14 mm. 



Loo Choo Islands (Mr. Y. Hirase). 

 ^ This form resembles Peristernia infracincta (Kobelt)= in colora- 

 tion, but differs in wanting the subcentral stronger spiral on the 

 upper whorls, and four larger spirals below the periphery of the 

 last whorl, which Kobelt found constant in ten specimens of his

 somewhat extended range in the southwest Pacific, but it has 

 not before been reported from so far north as the Loo Choo group. 



LITTORINID^ 

 Eohinella Cumingi var. luchuana nov. 



Shell similar to E. cumincji Phil, in having a circular, deep 

 umbilicus bounded by a while marginal rib; but narrower, with the 

 last whorl less depressed, the two peripheral series of tubercles 

 much less prominent, some coarse, subtuberculate cords revolving 

 between them, and also below the sutural series. Base more con- 

 vex, .vith finer and not granose spiral strise below the subperi- 

 pheral series of granules. Flesh-colored, violet or bluish, the 

 tubercles whitish. Aperture orange-brown inside; dark brown 

 with the columella purple, in violet or bluish shells.

 but none approach the real Cumingi of Polynesia. 



TXJRBONILLID^. 

 Turbonilla varicifera n. sp. 



Shell long and slender, white, composed of at least 1-5 whorls 

 (the nuclear portion broken off). Sculpture of close, rather stout 

 rounded ribs only very slightly sinuous or oblique, about 19 in 

 number on the last whorl (which ends with a broad varix), as 

 wide as or slightl}' wider than the intervals, and stopping abruptly 

 just below the periphery, the somewhat convex base very faintly 

 striated spirally. Scattered among the ribs there are a few stout, 

 wide, rounded varices, at intervals of several whorls. Aperture 

 small, subtrapezoidal, che columella straight and vertical. 



Length 11.8, diam. 2.6 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



This rather large, many-whorled and varicose species differs 

 from T. varicosn iu having tlie columella straight above, not 

 " superne valde sinuata, '" as Duuker describes his species.

TROOHIDJE. 



Cantharidus (Phasianotrochus) Hirasei n. sp 



Shell ovate-pyramidal, solid, of a uniform olive or brownish- 

 olive color, or belted with numerous reddish spiral bands. Smooth 

 except for faint growth-lines above, the l)ase scored bv 5 or 6 nar- 

 row, spaced, concentric grooves, stronger near the axis. Spire 

 conic, whorls 6i, convex, the last subaugular at the periphery, 

 convex beneath. Aperture oblique, brilliantly green inside, with 

 a dusky submarginal band, the edge pale; columella opaque white, 

 rounded ; the umbilical region irapertorate or with a very minute 

 perforation. 



Alt. 10, diam. 6.5 to 7 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



This is a true Phadanotrochus, the first made knovTU from 

 Japan, having the green nacre of the interior iridescent with the 

 characteristic splendor of the subgenus. The other species of this 

 division are from Australia and Tasmania. 



In one banded specimen the earliest three whorls are variegated 

 with pink and white, like a PlumnneUa, and assimilating to some 

 Australian species of Phasiaiiotrochm. 

 Cantharidus bisbalteatus n. sp. 



Shell elevated conic, imperforate or minutely rimate, glossy. 

 Encircled by a crimson or scarlet belt at the periphery and another 

 bordering the suture below, continuous or interrupted by white 

 streaks or spots, and roseate around the umbilical tract, the inter- 

 vening spaces somewhat olivaceous, with a few narrow spirals of 

 alternate blue or white and red-brown dots; two or three of these 

 spiral lines ascending the spire. Sculpture of slight growth-lines 

 and fainter or wholly obsolete fine spiral strife above, and about 

 fi fine-spaced grooves around the umbilical region, stronger toward 

 the middle. Spire conic, the apex acute; whorls about (ii, quite 

 convex, separated by an impressed suture, the last whorl subaugu- 

 lar at the periphery, convex beneath. Aperture oblique, roundetl- 

 rhombic, pearly and iridescent within, with green, or green and red 

 reflections; scarcely showing any appearance of sulcation. Co- 

 lumella white, concave above, somewhat straightened in the 

 middle; columellar area excavated, white.

Hirado, Hizen (Mr. Y. Hirase). 




200 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



Compared with the excessively variable C. japonicus (A. Ad.), 

 described as Zizyphinus Japonicus, the present species difiers in 

 being shorter and broader, with more eoavex whorls, less angular 

 periphery and smoother base, the concentric grooves being finer, 

 and not extending outward so far. 



Clanoulns gemmulifer n. sp. 



Shell low-trochiform, solid, angular at the periphery, slightly 

 convex beneath. Ground-color red or dull red. Sculpture of 

 spiral cords cut into smooth rounded beads, these cords a little 

 narrower than the intervals on the upper surface, smaller on the 

 base and about equal in width to their intervals. Above the peri- 

 phery on the last whorl there are five bead-rows, all of them 

 dotted, either having a black interval between two white beads, 

 or with a black and a white bead, the intervals consisting 

 of two or three red beads; base similarly' variegated, but the dots 

 are sometimes brown. Furrows between the bead-rows finely and 

 densely decussate by spiral and oblique raised stria or threads. 

 Spire straightly conic, the apex acute, roseate. Whorls about 6, 

 the last deflexed in front. Aperture oblique, contracted by a sim- 

 ple, rather compressed fold at the foot of the columella, and 

 another near the upper end of the outer lip, several small folds 

 between them. Columella contorted above, deeply entering the 

 false-umbilicus, the margin of which is toothed. Parietal callus 

 strongly plicate. 



Alt. 7.5, diam. 9 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



Closely related to C. iiianjaritarius Phil., which occurs at the 

 same locality, but is larger and more elevated, with more whorls, 

 and further differs in the trifid coluraellar tooth, more rounded 

 periphery, and in having the first and third bead-rows unspotted 

 except close to the aperture. A well -grown specimen of C. mar- 

 (jaritarius measures: alt. 15, diam. 16 mm. C. unedo is a more 

 elevated species, with heavier eoluinellar fold and some unspotted 

 bead-rows. 



Clanoulus microdon vnr. ater n. v. 



Shell black with a few inconspicuous whitish dots and bright 

 rose apex, the coloration resembling C. atropurpureus Gld. Spiral 

 lira; about 17 on the last whorl, with threads or minor lirie in some 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 201 



of (he intervals. Whorls of Ihe spire angular by the prominence 

 of the middle beaded cord. Whorls 6. 



Alt. 11, diam. 13 mm. 



Hirado, Hizeu {Y. Hirase). 



Seems to agree with C. microdon except in coloration, greater 

 number of spiral cords and other characters given above, but will 

 probably be considered a separate species eventually. From the 

 Polynesian C. atropurpiirew, which von Martens reports from the 

 Mergui Archipelago, it is distinct iu sculpture, etc. 

 Clanoulus hizenensis n. sp. 



Shell turbinate, moderately solid, alternately whitish and dark 

 brown in broad radial flames above, whitish profusely speckled 

 with olive-brown beneath. Sculpture of four coarse, spaced, 

 beaded, spiral cords above, separated by intervals of their own 

 width, sharply and densely striate by the growth-lines; the base 

 with 9 much smaller, closer, concentric cords, slightly cut by 

 obliquely radial grooves, the outer cord larger. Whorls nearly 6, 

 the last rounded at the periphery, slightly convex beneath. Aper- 

 ture oblique, rounded, the outer lip usually weakly plicate within 

 in fully mature shells; columella having a weak fold above, and 

 inserted on the right side of the umbilicus, terminating below in a 

 strongly projecting, simple, tooth-like fold. Marginal rib of the 

 umbilicus having a few weak nodules. 



Alt. 7, diam. 7.5 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



Closely resembles the more plain-colored specimens of C. Thomasi 

 Crosse, from New Caledonia, but the spirals above are less unequal, 

 more strongly beaded and more spaced, with sharply striate inter- 

 vals. It is a somewhat larger shell than C. Tkoma-ii. Sometimes 

 one or two of the spaces between the cords of the upper surface 

 bear a minute thread. 

 Euohelus ruber A. Ad., var. brunneus »■ v. 



Shell similar to E. ruber, but dull brown or fleshy brown, with 

 scattered brown dots. 



Alt. 6^, diam. 6 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen. 



Similar to E. ruber in sculpture, but as all the Japanese speci- 

 mens I have seen are diflerent in color, it is probably distinguish- 

 able as a dull-colored race. 




202 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



Chlorostoma argyrostomum var. basiliratum n. 



Shell imperforate, smaller than the typical form, with coarser 

 corrugation above, the base strongly lirate concentrically. 



Hirado, Hizen (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



This form is intermediate between the finely corrugated Chinese 

 argyrostomum and the coai-sely sculptured Japanese species of 

 Chlorostoma. I know of no authentic record of C. argyrostomum 

 from Japan. 



ACM^ID^. 

 Acmaea Heroldi var. signata uo\ . 



About the size and form of ^4. Heroldi. Nearly smooth or with 

 ver}- low, weak radial ribs; white, with eight gray rays variegated 

 with brown. Interior white or brownish within the muscle-scar, 

 the edge dotted and maculate with brown. 



Length 13, breadth 10, alt. 4 mm. 



Otoshima, prov. Bitchu (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



A form from Kamakura, taken by Mr. F. Stearns, seems refer- 

 able to this variety. It is smaller and higher, length 9.5, breadth 

 7.5, alt. 4 mm., without a marked internal margin or central area, 

 the rays showing through. 



It may be well to say in this connection that the Patella jyallidn 

 of Gould, formerly referred by me to Helcioniseus, is a true 

 Acmtm in shell characters. Mr. Hirase has sent specimens from 

 Mashike, Teshio, in Hokkaido. 



Patella grata Gould has " about the contour of Helcioniseus 

 eucosmius Pils., is quite acutely conic, with strongly spinose ribs," 

 according to a note I made on the type, No. 1,965, U. S. Na- 

 tional Museum. 



PATELLID^. 

 Patella luchuana n. sp. 



Shell small, solid, rounded-oval, conic, the altitude nearly half 

 the breadth; apex erect and acute, situated a little in front of the 

 centre; anterior and posterior slopes .somewhat convex. Surface 

 dull, sculptured with many narrow riblets, several inconspicuous 

 radial threads in each interval. Greenish gray, indistinctly 

 speckled with dark brown. Interior bluish or livid white, the 

 area within the muscle-impression large, calloused, the ira[)ression

 ish border and profuse) v or sparingly dotted with black -brown. 



Length 12, breadth 10, alt. 4.5 mm. 



Length 13, breadth 10.5, alt. 4.5 mm. 



Loo Cboo Islands (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



A small species with inconspicuous sculpture, but so solid that I 

 take the specimens to be adult. The base is curved in some speci- 

 mens, as though they bad lived on shells, while in others it is 

 nearly level. None of the species described from the region 

 resembles this one. 



CHITONID^. 

 Onithochiton Hirasei n sp. 



Oblong, moderately elevated, not carinate, the dorsal ridge 

 being rounded, side slopes straight; smooth and glossy, yellow 

 marbled with whitish, having a chestnut triangle or some chestnut 

 dots at the ridge of each valve, several blue and olive clouds or 

 blotches in front of the diagonal lines, and with more or less 

 variegation of the same colors on the lateral areas. 



Anterior valve having black eyes arranged in about 10 primary 

 radii, with many others irregularly scattered or in shorter rows. 

 Valve ii, as usual, longer than iii to viii; all intermediate valves 

 beaked, having the lateral areas indistinctly detined, the diagonal 

 ridge inconspicuous except near the beaks ; growth-lines fine, curv- 

 ing backward on the ridge; and adults have several spaced, deeper 

 concentric grooves near tlie sides and anterior margin of each 

 valve; near the beaks the diagonal ridge becomes raised and beaded, 

 and there are irregular, fonvardly-eonverging zigzag grooves upon the 

 pleural tracts. A narrow line of eyes radiates along the anterior 

 part of each lateral area; and there are pits as large as the eyes, 

 but not pigmented, scattered sparsely upon the pleural tracts. 

 Valve viii depressed, triangular, with the usual tenuinal apex, 

 and linear, rugose, posterior area; the breadth of the tegmentum 

 twice its length. 



Interior white, stained with dull purple and puuctulate in the 

 middle; valve-callus heavy; reflexed border rather wide; sinus 

 rather wide, finely denticulate; insertion plates moderately long, 

 finely pectinated outside; slits 9 in valve i, 1-1 in valves ii to vii; 

 a wide, flat ledge in place of the insertion-plate in valve viii.

Hirado, prov. Hizen. Types No. 80,571, coll. A. N. S. P., 

 from No. 1,176 of Mr. Hirase's catalogue. 



This is the first species of the genus described since the publica- 

 tion of my monograph in 1892, and the only one known from 

 north of the equator. The sculpture of the valves is unlike any 

 described OnithochUon. A very young specimen was reported as 

 " Tonicia sp. " in the Nautilus, XII, p. 50. 



It is named in honor of my esteemed Japanese correspondent. 



CRYPTOPLACIDJE. 



Two species of Cryptopiax, the first known from north of the 

 equator, have been found by Mr. Hirase, at Hirado, Hizcu. One 

 of them, which I call C. Japonicu.s n. sp. , has valve-sculpture hke 

 C. Guiinii (Rve. ) of South Australia, and the spacing of the 

 valves along the back is similar; but in the Japanese species the 

 last four valves are smaller, valve viii l)eing scarcely longer than 

 valve ii, while in C. Gunnii and C. driatus it is a fourth longer. 

 The girdle is densely spiculose, much as in C. striatiis. The articu- 

 lameuta are green. 



Length of dried animal about 26, breadth 5.5 mm. 



In another species, C. rhodoplax n. sp., the valves are spaced 

 about as in C. juponicus, but are sculptured much as in C. larvce- 

 J'ormh, with low, irregular ridges jjarallel to the lateral margins of 

 the valves, the articuhimenta being bright rose colored. Valve vi 

 is the smallest. The posterior insertion-plate of valve viii is vertical; 

 and the sutural laminae and insertion -plates of all the valves are 

 much shorter than in C. larvcejormis. 



Length of the dried animal 28 mm. 



A full account of these species will be given later; and mean- 

 time I hope to procure alcoholic specimens for description and illus- 

 tration. 



PETRICOLIDJE. 

 Fetrioola cyclns n. sp. 



Shell solid, white, subcircular though with somewhat irregular 

 outline, swollen, the beaks full, projecting, turned forward, situ- 

 ated at about the anterior third of the length. Periphery convex

throughout, the posterior end sometimes a little produced. Sculp- 

 ture of slightly irregular radial riblets about equal to their inter- 

 vals, often stronger posteriorly, gradually weakening anteriorly 

 and wholly obsolete on the anterior half or third of the valve; 

 rude, crowded, bluntly lamellar circular striae everywhere minutely 

 rouo-heuing the surface. Interior white, the pallial sinus large 

 and rounded, extending to about the middle of the shell's length. 

 Hinge rather strong, the right valve with two diverging, rather 

 compressed, and long, erect, cardinal teeth, the posterior one the 

 more slender; left valve with an erect, triangular, bilobed cardinal, 

 with a subobsolete, diverging tooth on either side. Ligament 

 short, almost entirely immersed. 



Length 15, alt. 15, diara. 12 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen (Mr. Y. Hirase). Types No. 80,580, coll. 

 A. N. S. P., from No. 1,199 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



A very short, subglobular species, somewhat related to P. lith- 

 ophaga Eetz. of Europe, but rounder, with more deeply immersed 

 ligament, stouter hinge, different shaped and stronger teeth. The 

 sculpture in some specimens is not dissimilar. As usual in the 

 genus, the teeth are liable to fracture, and when broken often do 

 not show plainly that they are injured. 



In a variety which may be called var. sculpturata the posterior 

 end is more prolonged, and the entire surface of the valves ribbed. 

 The teeth agree with P. cyclus. Types from Puttalam, Ceylon 

 (Coll. A. N. S. P.). One specimen from Hirado, Hizen, seems 

 to belong here. 



Petricola cyclus belongs to the section Rupellaria,* as defined 

 by Prof. Dall in his exposition of the Petricolidce ; ' the section 

 Claudiconcha being represented in Japan by P. mondrosa, and the 

 section Petricolaria by P. lequistriata Sowb.

ribs, fully double the width of the interstices, closely and irregu- 

 larly crenulated by low concentric blunt, crowded laminse, which 

 on the later growth are obsolete in the grooves, but toward the beaks 

 are narrower and sharper, less crowded, and continuous across ribs 

 and intervals. Beaks full, projecting, curved forward. Lunule 

 heart-shaped, dark brown, ribbed and defined by a groove. Area 

 well sunken, ribless and wide in the left valve, indistinct in the right. 



Anterior end short, rounded ; posterior end more broadly rounded. 

 Interior pure white, the right valve with three diverging cardiiial 

 teeth, the posterior two grooved; left valve with two cardinals, 

 the anterior one slender, posterior stouter, shorter and deeply 

 grooved. 



Cavity of the beaks deep. Pallial sinus small, triangular, nar- 

 row and acute. Valve margins, except the hinge line, very 

 weaklv fluted and closely crenulate. 



Length 43, alt. 37.5, diam. 29 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



This species resembles V. jedoensis Lischke, but has hardly 

 more than half as many, and stronger, ribs. There is a specimen 

 before me from Susaki, Awaji Island, besides several from the 

 type locality. 

 Tapes platyptycha n. sp. 



Shell oblong, comjiressed, the length somewhat exceeding 

 2h times the diameter; white, profusely marked with angular 

 red-brown reticulating lines grouped into triangular spots, or with 

 inverted V-shaped markings, and four radial series of brown 

 blotches alternating with white spots. Sculptured with concentric 

 ridges wider than their intervals, broad and flattened toward rhe 

 lower margin and especifilly posteriorly, fine and close toward the 

 beaks. Beaks low, yellow or purple, situated at about the ante- 

 rior fifth of the length, the dorsal margin behind them nearly 

 straight; posterior end obliquely truncate, bluntly regular at its 

 junction with the upper and basal margins. Anterior end short, 

 rather attenuated, much as in T. adgpersa. Lunule narrow, indis- 

 tinctly defined by an impressed line, flattened, marked with some 

 oblique brown lines. Area depressed, transversely maculate with 

 groups of dark lines. Interior white, tinted with sulphur yellow 

 within the pallial line. Pallial sinus broad and rounded, not quite 

 reaching the middle of the length of the shell. Anterior cardinal

tooth in each valve compressed and simple, the middle one stouter, 

 bifid. 



Length .54, alt. .37, diam. 21 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



This species stands near T. quadriradiata Desh., diflering in the 

 coarser sculpture, more distinctly truncate posterior end, and de- 

 cidedly shallower pallial sinus. The color of the interior is also 

 difierent. T. deshaijesii Hanley has a narrower and deeper pallial 

 sinus. 



Tapes phenax n. pp. 



Shell oblong, rather swollen, the diameter contained 2^ times in 

 the length; pale yellow, densely reticulated with angular reddish- 

 brown and purplish lines, darker in four wide rays, which are more 

 or less blotched with brown ; pale flesh-tinted or whitish toward 

 the bealis. Sculpture of fine, crowded, concentric rib-strise. 

 Beaks moderately prominent, at about the anterior fifth of the 

 shell's length. Dorsal margin moderately curved; posterior 

 end rounded; basal margin weU arched ; anterior end short, 

 rounded. Lunule rather broadly lanceolate, defined by slight 

 grooves, dark, with irregular darker lines. Area lanceolate, 

 sunken, smooth, variegated. Interior white at the margins, ochre 

 or reddish-yellow in the cavity. Pallial sinus broad and deep, 

 reaching the middle of the shell's length or slightly past it. 



Length 4C, alt. 31, diam. 20.5 mm. 



Loo Choo Islands (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



This handsome species is far more finely sculptured and more 

 inflated than T. quadriradiata Desh., but in my opinion it is the 

 form identified as quadriradiata by Roemer in his magnificent 

 monograph of Venus, Part 2, PI. 18, fig. 2. The crowded rib- 

 strife of the surface do not become wider on the lower and posterior 

 portions of the valves as they do in T. quadriradiata Desh., and 

 the posterior cardinal tooth of the right valve, while grooved at 

 the lip, is not broadly bifid as in Deshayes' species. 



DONACID^. 

 Bonax kiusiuensis n ^p 



Shell small, rather thin, white with one or two ill-defined ochra- 

 ceous rays, or yellow with some dusky concentric streaks, the beaks

than twice the altitude, and nearly three times the diameter; 

 anterior end longer, tapering, rounded; posterior end slightly con- 

 vex, bluntly angular below; the beaks situated at about the pos- 

 terior two-fifths of the length. Surface glossy, sculptured with 

 slight growth-lines aud exceedingly fine, subobsolete radial stria;, 

 angular posteriorly, the posterior area, sculptured with strong, 

 smooth radial ribs narrower than their flat intervals and terminating 

 on the angle. Ligament very short and swollen. Interior white 

 with brown stains near the ends: posterior lateral tooth strong; 

 basal margin finely but distinctly crenulated. 



Length 9, alt. 5.5, diam. 3.3 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen TMr. Y. Hi rase). 



A small species belonging to the section Chion, chiefly distin- 

 guished by the strong sculpture of the posterior end. 



ANATINID^. 

 Anatina impura n. >p. 



Shell oblong, fragile, rather ventricose, widely gaping posteriorly, 

 but slightly so in front ; sculptured with low, irregular wrinkles, 

 and where unworn, with the usual granulation. While and pearly 

 above, where worn through the very thin porcellaaous coat, cov- 

 ered at the margins with a dirty yellowish cuticle, which is more 

 persistent and lamellose on the posterior rostrum. Beaks at the 

 middle of the shell's length, not turned forward, contiguous, one 

 of them worn through, both slit as usual. Anterior end broadly 

 rounded; dorsal margin almost straight; posterior end narrow, the 

 margins hardly expanded; basal margin parallel with the upper 

 margin except posteriorly where it rises suddenly. Interior whitish, 

 slightly wrinkled, the chondrophore and buttress as usual. 



Length 38, alt. 20, diam. 15 mm. 



Kamakura, province of Sagami (types No. 68,536 and 70,812, 

 coll. A. N. S. P.). 



This species differs from .4. japonica Lischke in the median posi- 

 tion of the beaks and different shape of the posterior end. Lischke 

 has figured two somewhat diverse forms under the head A. 

 japonica. That represented in his figs. 9, 10, has been taken i)y 

 Mr. Hirase at Hirado, Hizen. Having before me all of the 

 species of Anatina credited to Japan, as well as most of the Phil- 

 ippine forms, I find myself unable to place the specimens described 

 above in any of the accepted species. A. kamakurann, of which 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 209 



I have seen a good mauy specimens, differs constantly in its iong 

 form and the different shape of the posterior end. 



LIMID^E. 

 lima Hirasei n. sp. 



Shell inecjuilateral, thin, white, broadly gaping anteriorly, 

 slightly so posteriorly, compressed, the valves but little convex; 

 beaks a trifle in front of the middle of the short hinge-hne. An- 

 terior auricle minute, triangular, acuminate, bent inward; posterior 

 auricle narrow. Cavity of the beaks rather deep. A strong rib 

 runs along the posterior margin slightly within the edge. Surface 

 closely and very finely striate radially, the striation obsolete ante- 

 riorly and on the posterior slope and auricle. 



Length 18, alt. 21, diam. 7.5 mm.; length of hinge-line 

 6.5 mm. 



Hirado, prov. Hizen, Kiusiu, Japan (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



L. orientalis Adams and Reeve, and most of the other small 

 Oriental species, are much more coarsely sculptured than this 

 species. L. Dunkeri E. A. Smith is evenly striated throughout, 

 the striie slightly diverging from a median line, and it is nearly 

 equilateral. In L. Hirasei striation gradually becomes obsolete 

 on the anterior half of the valves, is abruptly discontinued at the 

 posterior slope, and there is no divarication from a median line. 

 The shell is conspicuously inequilateral. 



The species is named for my esteemed Japanese correspondent. 

 L. Dunkeri also occurs at Hirado, Hizen, whence specimens have 

 been received from Jlr. Hirase. 



Area (Scapharoa) nippouensis n. sp. 



Shell of medium size, thin, infliated, the left valve decidedly 

 larger, the beaks full, moderately elevated, incurved and turned 

 slightly forward, situated at the anterior two-fifths of the hinge- 

 line. Sculpture the same in both valves, consisting of 37 or 38 

 equal radial ribs, which are nearly flat-topped, at least near the 

 periphery, and separated by interspaces narrower than the ribs; 

 the whole marked by slight growth-lines in denuded shells. Cov- 

 ered with a thin chestnut cuticle, which is densely, minutely 

 striate, and bears spaced bristles in the intercostal spaces, on the 

 median and posterior portions of the valves, and on the anterior 

 14 




210 PEOCEEDlXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



portion is lamellose and bears flat, triangular processes in the 

 interspaces. Toward the beaks the cuticle is worn off. Hinge- 

 line two-thirds the greatest length of the shell, straight, strongly 

 angular at both ends. Anterior margin evenly rounded; basal 

 margin well-arched, the posterior end noticeably arcuate, oblique, 

 meeting the basal margin in a blunt angle. Cardinal area very 

 narrow, sunken behind the beaks, with an elevated margin; 

 slightly wider and less sunken in front. Hinge teeth small and 

 vertical in the middle, well inclined and larger toward the two 

 ends ; a distinct though narrow ledge below the posterior teeth. 

 Interior pure white, slightly grooved and delicately striate radially 

 in the cavity of the valves, becoming very deeply grooved toward 

 the margins, the summits of the intervening ridges concave. 



Length 45, alt. 36, diam. 29 mm. ; sometimes larger, length 

 55, alt. 46 mm. 



East coast of Hondo (Jliss A. C. Hartshorn). Typos No. 

 79,009, coll. A. N. S. P. 



This species, of which we have six specimens from two sources 

 (Nos. 79,009, 78,749, 70,970), is distinguished by its well- 

 rounded contours, unusually narrow cardinal area, the marked 

 disparity in size of the valves, and the large number of ribs. Tt is" 

 somewhat allied to A. disparilis Reeve,* of which we have speci- 

 mens from Singapore, but that is less orbicular, with more of a 

 ridge or angle defining the posterior slope, and densely lamellose, 

 not bristly, in the intercostal spaces. 



In some specimens of A. nipjJonemU the cuticle is greenish in 

 places. 



* A. disparilis o{ Kobelt's monograph is clearly a species different from 

 that of Reeve.

HOTE ON THE ODONTOSTOMIDa:. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



Dr. Pilsbry, Conservator of the Concliological Section of The 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, has called my 

 attention to the fact that the name Odontostomus was first proposed 

 for mollusca in the Index 3Iolluscorum pnesentis avi Miisei Prin- 

 cipis atigustissimi Christiani Frederici, edited by H. Beck in 1837, 

 thus having one year of priority over its use in ichthyology, 



I take pleasure in dedicating the necessary changes to Dr. B. 

 "W. Evermann, the distinguished ichthyologist of the United 

 States Fish Commission, and joint author of that monumental 

 work, The Fishes of North America. 



The natural derivative, Fvermannia, is already used in ichthy- 

 ology, so I propose Evermanella. 



The changes, with nearly all of the synonymy, will result in the

OBSERVATIOITS MADE IN 1900 ON GLACIERS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA. 

 BY GEORGE AND WILLIAM S. VAUX, JR. 



While the glaciers noted in the following report form but a small 

 fraction of the hundreds in the Rocky iMouutainsof Canada, their 

 continued recession may be taken as an indication of the changes 

 which are taking place in the glaciers of the region. A moderate 

 winter, followed hj an early and warm spring melted the snow and 

 flooded the rivers at au early date. The continued wet and stormy 

 weather, which extended far into the spring and summer, did 

 much to increase the amount of melting. So far as it has been 

 possible to determine, all the glaciers of this region are still reced- 

 ing. One exception to this rule was reported, but the advance 

 could not be proved with any certainty. ^ 



Victoria Glacier. 



The rocks marked last year to determine the motion and shrink- 

 age of this glacier were again noted on July 24, 1900. The large 

 block of limestone about one mile from the tongue marked " VX 

 '99 " appeared to have moved 147 feet, while a large block of 

 sandstone near the terminal moraine had an apparent motion of 

 115 feet. The general condition of the glacier appears practically 

 the same as last year. Measurements taken on the northwest side 

 indicate a shrinkage of about six feet for the 3'ear. Several very 

 fine glacier tables were noted, one being a block of sandstone 

 eighteen inches thick, from ten to twelve feet in diameter, and 

 elevated not less than five feet from the surface of the surround- 

 ing ice. 



AsuLKAN Glacier. 



This glacier has receded perceptibly since last year, the tongue 

 being twenty-four feet further up the valley than when last noted. 

 There has also been a marked shrinkage in every dimension. 




214 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF \ [March, 



Illecillewaet Glacier. 



The very small recession ia the tougue of the Illecillewaet 

 Glacier during the summer of 1899 was found to have been largely 

 made up in 1900, so that the average of the two years was not far 

 from that of the past thirteen, as previously noted.' A distinct 

 shrinkage was observed in all dimensions, but this was most notice- 

 able at the tongue which was now 140 feet above the rock " C," 

 nearly twice the distance of the previous year. 



Our work the past summer consisted : («) in taking the test pic- 

 ture of the lower part of the glacier, which was made under unfav- 

 orable conditions on August 7, 1900; (6) location of the border 

 of the ice on the map of 1899, and (c) location and measurement 

 of motion of line of plates across tlie glacier. 



a. Of the test picture nothing need be added except that the 

 series is now complete for three consecutive years and furnishes 

 a most interesting illustration of the comparatively slight and yet 

 none the less constant changes in the contour of the ice. 



b. The position of the edge of the ice was easily located with 

 reference to the several fixed rocks laid out on the general survey 

 of 1899. The plotting of this border line showed that the glacier 

 had receded an average of not far from twenty feet on the sides 

 and sixty-four feet on the extreme tongue. At one point the ice 

 seemed to have changed but little since last year, while at others 

 the recession was more than 100 feet. This constant yearly reces- 

 sion has been proved to be in progress at least since 1887. 



c. The location and measurement of the line of eight plates 

 across the glacier, which were first laid out on July 31, 1899, and 

 had consequently been on the ice almost exactly one year, was 

 taken up on the 6th of August, 1900, on which date plates Nos. 

 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 were located. Plate No. 8 could not be 

 found, and it was not discovered till several days later, when its 

 position also was obtained. 



All the j)lates seem to have moved in lines almost parallel with 

 the centre line of the glacier. The following table shows the 

 motion of the plates for the year, and also repeats for comparison 

 the motions determined in the fall of 1899, after the plates had 

 been on the ice but thirty-six days. It will be noted that the con-

cave or northeast side has a greater daily motion than last year, 

 while the convex or southwest has not moved at quite so rapid a 

 rate. Whether this change is accidental or is the result of peculiar 

 conditions has not been determined. 



While the plates were left on the surface of the glacier, it is 

 hardly likely that future measurements will be of great value, 

 should the plates be again found. They are approaching a much 

 rougher portion of the glacier, broken by crevasses, deep wells 

 and seracs, and even should they remain on the surface, in many 

 instances it will be impossible to see them from the base line. 

 They have, however, served their purpose in demonstrating that the 

 average motion of nearly two feet per day as determined by Dr. 

 W. S. Green in 1888 was either much greater than the actual 

 motion, or was the result of conditions which do not now exist.

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW BEES COLLECTED BY MB. H. H. SMITH IN 



BRAZIL.-II. 



BY T. D. A. COCKEEELL. 



Lithurgus cornmbae n. sp. 



?. — Length 7 mm., black; with silvery- white pubescence, dense 

 on the face (except the elevated portion, which is bare) and 

 cheeks; rather dense on metathorax (except basal area and middle 

 of sides) and pleura; hind margin of prothorax, and tubercles, 

 edged with dense white hair, forming a conspicuous white line; 

 lateral hind margins of abdominal segments 1 to 3, and the whole 

 hind margins of 4 and 5, with snow-white hair-bands; apical seg- 

 ment of abdomen, and dark parts of the two previous segments, 

 with some short black hair, but it is very inconspicuous, and there 

 is no apical fimbria; ventral scopa white, tinged with ferruginous 

 on the fifth segment; legs with white hair, that on hind tarsi long 

 and slightly ferruginous ; femora, and basal two segments of 

 abdomen, dark ferruginous; facial eminence rather low but dis- 

 tinct, obscurely bituberculate ; head and thorax strongly and 

 densely punctured; antennre short, flagellum stout, and obscurely 

 brown beneath; tegula3 dark reddish-brown; wings brownish, 

 nervures and stigma pieeous; hind tibiae with numerous short spines 

 on the outer side, as usual in the genus; spurs white. 



Hab. — Corumba, April. This is the smallest Lithurgus I have 

 ever seen, but L. rufipes Sm., from South Africa, is nearly as 

 small. The genus is new to the fauna of Brazil. The stigma of 

 L. corumbce is somewhat larger than is usual in the genus. The 

 marginal cell is shaped as in the North American and European 

 species, not acutely r>ointed as in the Indian L. airatus Sm. 

 Ceratina maculifrons Smilh, :S53. 



Cbapada, January. 1 ? . — Length 6J mm. ; difiers from 

 Smith's description by having no yellow on the four posterior 

 tibia;, the sides of the metathorax having no white pubescence, and 

 the hind femora having au apical tooth or projection. The peculiar 

 face-markings, the tooth on the outer side of the hind tibia near 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 217 



the base, etc., are as described by Smith, and I have little doubt 

 that the identificatiou is correct. Smith's description reads as if 

 the thorax were yellow, but of course this was not intended. A 

 different Ceratma, also taken at Chapada (in December), is appar- 

 ently the uudeseribed ? of C. viridida Sm. It is a brilliant 

 insect, and the face is without light markings. 



Temnosoma metallioum Smith, var. chapadse, n. var. 



?. — Differs from Smith's description of metalUcum by the larger 

 size (about 8i mm.); mandibles green at l)ase; scape green; 

 mesothorax closely and more or less confluently punctured ; wings 

 little iridescent, not noticeably clouded at apex ; tarsi practically 

 black, basal joint of hind tarsi green; abdomen with jjurple reflec- 

 tions, basal margin of second and third segments brilliant purple. 

 Enclosure of metathorax sculptured as Smith describes for 

 metalUcum. 



c?. — 1\ mm. long, similar to the ?, abdomen with scarcely any 

 purple. 



Hah. — Chapada, March, c? and ? ; also in November. Prob- 

 ably a valid species, but I leave it as a variety until I can com- 

 pare it with authentic material of T. melalliemn. 



The following table will facilitate the determination of Tem- 

 nosoma : 



Abdomen impunctate, T. Iczvigatum Sm. 



Abdomen punctate, ...» 1. 



1. Margin of metathoracic enclosure smooth, T. ceruginosum Sm. 

 Margin of metathoracic enclosure transversely striate, . . 2. 



2. Wings smoky (Mexico), T. smaragdinum Sm. 



Wmgs almost clear (Brazil), 



T. metalllcum Sm. and var. chapadcB Ckll. 



T. smaragdinum occurs as far north as San Rafael, Vera Cruz, 

 Mexico, where Townseud took it at flowers of Cordla, at the end 

 of June. 

 Corynura atromarginata n. sp. 



9. — Length 8^ mm., dull from the excessively close punctures; 

 black; lateral projections of protliorax, hind margin of mesothorax 

 very narrowly, postscutellura and metathorax, greenish; sides of 

 basal segment of abdomen and extreme base of second segment 

 also green; clypeus prominent, with rather sparse large punctures 

 on a tessellated surface; mandibles long and dark; antennae dark. 




218 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



scape long, flagelluin brownish beneath and delicately pubescent; 

 tegulre very dark brown; base of metathorax with oblique radi- 

 ating strife; wings hyaline, the costal margin, including the 

 marginal cell, very broadly dark fuliginous (as in some Tachi- 

 nidfe); legs very dark reddish-brown: abdomen with long white 

 hairs beneath; punctures of first dorsal segment of abdomen 

 stronger and less dense than on second, which has the punctures 

 minute and as close as is possible; hind spur of hind tibia pecti- 

 nate, with three large teeth. 



Hab. — Chapada, Jlarch and April ; five specimens. Very close 

 to the Mexican C. dkcolor (Smith), thus adding another to the 

 now rather numerous instances of Brazilian bees representative of, 

 but not identical with, those of Mexico or the adjacent parts of 

 the United States. 



This might be held to differ subgenerically from the type of 

 Coryimra, but in that case C'acosoma Smith is not available, be- 

 cause of the prior Cacosoma Felder, lS74. 



C. atfomarginata is one of five species flying at Chapada, all 

 having the first recurrent nervure interstitial with the second 

 transverso-cubital, and the niesothorax very densely punctured. 



These species are readily distinguished as follows: 



Costa fuliginous from base to marginal cell, 



atromarginata n. sp., 9. 



Costa not fuliginous from the bas,e, or not at all, .... 1. 



1. Abdomen long and narrow, clavate, like Baceha clavata, . 2. 

 Abdomen oval or suboval, hardly or not clavate, ... 3. 



2. Head and thorax bright golden-green, pseudobaccha n. sp., c?. 

 Head and thorax dark, sutiused with olive-green, 



jucitnda (Smith), c?. 



3. Marginal cell fuliginous, .... semimargiiinta n. sp., ?. 

 Tip of wing only fuliginous, chapadicola n. sp., ?. 



Corynura jucunda (Smith); n. syn. C. senigma (Oribodo). 



Hab. — Cluipada, December; 2 d^. So far as I can make out, 

 C. jucunda and wuif/ma are the same and identical with the insect 

 now before me. This gives it a range from S. Paulo and Cha- 

 pada, Brazil, to Rioja, Argentine Republic, the extremes being 

 about 1,250 miles apart. In view of what Sichel states about the 

 two sexes of Corynura, it seems likely that C. semimarglnfttn or 

 C. chapadicola may prove to be the ? of C. jucunda, but as I 

 have no proof of this, I treat both for the present as distinct. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 219 



Corynura pseudobaocha n. sp. 



cT. — Length about 8 mm. ; size and form of C. jueunda, but 

 easily distinguished by its very brilliant golden-green head and 

 thorax; the green of the abdomen also is bright, occupying the 

 sides of the first segment, the bases of the second, third, and most 

 of the fourth and fifth segments. Clypeus very prominent, with 

 large punctures on a shining surface; cheeks and sides of face 

 with short white hair; antennoe very long, flagellum ferruginous 

 beneath; teguhe bright reddish-testaceous; wings dusky at tips; 

 nervures and stigma very dark brown; second submarginal cell 

 narrow; femora and tibije green; knees, ends of tibire and all of 

 tarsi light ferruginous. 



Hab. — Chapada, January and November; 3 cf. 



Corynura semimarginata n. sp. 



9. — Length about 8 mm.; rather robust, black with green on 

 sides of face, hind edge of mesothorax, scutellum, postscutellum, 

 upper parts of raetathorax, and basal portions of the abdominal 

 segments; first abdominal segment subpetiolate, decidedly longer 

 than broad, bright ferruginous at its extreme base; antennas dark, 

 scape long, red-brown; wings with the marginal cell and beyond 

 fuliginous, stigma and nervures dark brown ; second submarginal 

 cell not so narrow as in the last species; inner loner angle of third 

 submarginal less than a right angle, whereas in pseudobaccha it is 

 quite a right angle : basal area of metathorax with oblique radi- 

 ating strife, and some transverse ones posteriorly, recalling the 

 sculpture of Temnosoma metallicum ; first abdominal segment with 

 sparse weak punctures, second finely rugulose with close minute 

 punctures ; hind spur of hind tibia pectinate with large teeth. 



Hab. — Chapada, April and November; 2?. Allied to C. agile 

 (Smith). 



Corynura chapadioola n. sp. 



9. — Length about 8 mm. ; robust, black, sides of face and hind 

 margin of mesothorax very narrowly dark green ; legs very dark 

 reddish-brown, with the pubescence mostly black or nearly so; 

 abdomen \\ith the first two segments black, the extreme base of the 

 second green, the remaining segments golden green, largely cov- 

 ered with very fine appressed yellowish pubescence, with black 

 bristles intermixed ; antenme dark brown, flagellum ferruginous at 




220 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



extreme tip ; tegulse very dark brown ; wiugs hyaline, apex fuhg- 

 inous; nervures and stigma sepia-brown; clypeus with large, sparse 

 punctures on a tessellate surface ; mesothorax microscopically tessel- 

 late, dull, with numerous minute punctures and scattered black 

 hairs; basal area of metathorax not defined, with feeble oblique 

 strife; lower inner angle of third submargiual cell less than a right 

 angle; most of basal segment of abdomen smooth and shining, but 

 its apical portion and all of second segment rough and minutely 

 sculptured; under side of abdomen with long yellowish-white hair; 

 hind spur of hind tibia pectinate, with three large blunt teeth. 

 The basal segment of the abdomen is broader than l<mg, thus 

 much broader than in the last species. 



Hab. — Chapada, Januaiy, March, September, November, 

 December; 33 specimens. The middle of the third abdominal 

 segment is often black. This species evidently belongs with Cory- . 

 nura ; but, at least in ihe ?, it has the abdomen formed as in 

 Augochlora. The maxillary palpi have six subequal joints, the 

 first two stout, the third subtriangular. 



In all the species of Corynura the anterior part of the meso- 

 thorax overlaps the middle of the prothorax, and in C. chapadicola 

 this is particularly well marked, the projecting portion being 

 bilobed. 



CORYNUROPSIS n. subg. 



First recurrent nervure received by second submarginal cell 

 before its end; mesothorax smooth and shining, with strong very 

 sparse punctures, its anterior margin prominently overlapping 

 prothorax; hind spur of hind tibia of ¥ pectinate with large teeth. 



Type, C. darwini n. sp. 



Corynura (Corynuropsis) darwini n. sp. 



9. — Length about 7 mm. ; head circular, a trifle broader than 

 thorax, dark vellowish-green, eyes emarginate; sides of face with 

 appressed pale plumose hair; clypeus short, it and the supraclypeal 

 area with numerous very large punctures; ocelli small and close 

 together; front densely and closely punctured ; labrum binodulose; 

 mandibles ferruginous at apex; mesothorax shining, purple-black, 

 with large sparse punctures; parapsidal grooves very deep; other 

 parts of thorax dark green; pleura with thin white pubescence; 

 base of metathorax smooth and shining, with a deep transverse

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TYMPANO-ETJSTACHIAN PASSAGE AND 



ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES IN THE COMMON TOAD 



(BUFO LENTIGINOSUS). 



BY HENRY FOX. 



A perusal of the literature relating to the subject reveals the 

 existence of considerable diversity of opinion among investigators 

 as to the exact morphological significance of the tympano-Eusta- 

 chian passage of the higher vertebrates. So far as its adult struc- 

 ture and relations are concerned, the passage would seem to be the 

 horaologue of the spiracle or hyomaudibular cleft of the elasmo- 

 branch fishes. Both structures occupy the same relative position 

 between the mandibular and hyoid arches, and, moreover, above the 

 dorsal margin of each the facial nerve divides into its two main 

 branches, one of which, the ramus palatinus, courses in front of 

 the cleft (or tube, as in the higher forms), while the other, the 

 ramus hyomandibularis, extends ventrally along its posterior wall. 

 Embryologisls, however, in studying the development of the 

 tympano-Eustachian passage iu various species of the higher verte- 

 brates, have found that its homology with the hyomaudibular cleft 

 is not so clearly expressed as the mature structure of the organ 

 would lead one to infer, so that certain morphologists, basing their 

 conclusions on the facts revealed by embryology, hold that the 

 tympano-Eustachian passage is a structure entirely, or in large 

 part, independent of the hyomandibular cleft. 



In order to determine, if possible, the exact relation of the 

 tympano-Eustachian passage to the hyomandibular cleft, I under- 

 took to follow out its entire embryonic history in the common toad 

 of Ihe eastern United States, Bafo lenliginosus.^ Contributions to 

 the knowledge of the development of the structures under con- 

 sideration had been made in the case of the Anura by Goette,^ 



' The investigations have been made in the Zoological Laboratory of the 

 University of Pennsylvania.

Villy/ and Gaupp.'' Shortly after I had begun the present 

 research a very important paper on the subject by Dr. Hans 

 Spemann appeared, treating of the earlier stages in the develop- 

 ment of the Eustachian tube in Raiia temporariaJ AH the inves- 

 tigators mentioned state that the development of the tympano- 

 Eustachiau passage in the forms studied is a very indirect one and 

 that it can be traced only with considerable difficulty. This diffi- 

 culty is attributed to the almost complete atrophy of the hyoman- 

 dibular cleft, which at an early period becomes so greatly reduced 

 as to be readily overlooked unless special attention is bestowed 

 on it. 



Of the investigators mentioned Goette correctly described the 

 degeneration of the hyomaudibular cleft, but his other results con- 

 cerning the development of the Eustachian tube may be disre- 

 garded, since his investigations were conducted at a time when less 

 favorable methods were at his disposal than we have at present. 

 From the results arrived at by the other three investigators a fairly 

 complete history of the Eustachian tube may be made out in the 

 case of Rana temporaria. Of these the work of Villy covers 

 fairly well the period of the metamorphosis, although his descrip- 

 tions are somewhat inexact, ° and his conclusion, that the Eusta- 

 chian tube " has almost certainly nothing to do with the hyomau- 

 dibular cleft," and that " the evidence ollered by the frog tends to 

 show that the two organs have no connection whatever with each 

 other," is certainly unsound, since such a connection between the 

 two has been established by the very careful work of Spemann on 

 the earlier stages of ihe tube in the same species. The correctnes.s 

 of Spemann's conclusions are corroborated by the results which I 

 have obtained in Bufo. Gaupp's chief contribution consists in his 

 calling attention to the appearance of the tubal Anlage at a stage 

 earlier than that in which it was first observed by Villy. For 

 further information concerning the results arrived at by these 

 investigators the reader is referred to the papers mentioned.

I. Observations and Results. 



I now turn to the description of the development of the tym- 

 pano-Eustaehian passage in the common toad. In this undertak- 

 ing I shall first treat in detail the condition and relations of the 

 structures under consideration in the different stages, beginning with 

 the earhest, and then at the end of the paper summarize the chief 

 features of this development. 



Stage I (PI. VI, fig. 1). — I begin at a stage when the hitherto 

 almost spherical embryo has elongated and when the tail has grown 

 out as a short stump. No external gills are as yet apparent. The 

 head has become differentiated from the body proper and the 

 region immediately posterior to it is marked by two or three slight 

 dorsi-ventral grooves, indicating the position of the future 

 branchial-clefts. 



PI. VI, fig. 1 is a coronal section of the anterior portion of an 

 embryo of this stage. The section is slightly oblique, the right side 

 being cut at a higher plane than the left. In this figure one will no- 

 tice that the anterior extremity of the pharynx is still separated from 

 the exterior, the conjoined endoderm and ectoderm forming at 

 this point a soUd partition of cells — the stomatodeal plate («i. ). 

 From this region posteriorly the cavity of the pharynx gradually 

 widens out until it forms a spacious chamber, the sides of which 

 are marked by four dorso-ventral grooves, marking the inner 

 openings of the visceral-clefts. Just back of the fourth visceral- 

 cleft the cavity narrows very suddenly to form the lumen of the 

 (jesophagus. 



As shown by the figure, there are only four visceral- clefts 

 (Hym., 2-4 v.f.) marked out at the present stage. With the 

 exception of the fourth, each of the clefts extends outward as a 

 solid, double-layered plate of endoderm, continuous at its inner 

 end with the epithelial lining of the pharynx and externally in 

 contact with the deeper layer of the ectoderm. Only the medial 

 portion of each cleft shows a lumen. The fourth visceral-cleft 

 resembles the others, except that it does not as yet quite reach the 

 epiblast. 



' In the drawing the distal extremities of the clefts are shown separated 

 by a narrow, clear area from this layer, bat this condition, I think, must 

 have been produced by shrinkage, a supposition which receives support from 

 the rough and irregular character of the distal edge.

226 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



Between the visceral- clefts intervene the visceral-arches. The 

 interior of each arch is made up of a mass of rather compact 

 mesenchyme, consisting of scattered cells, containing numerous 

 large yolk-spheres, barely distinguishable from. those occurring in 

 the endodermic lining of the pharynx. From this circumstance 

 the limits of the endoderm are somewhat difficult to define clearly, 

 and accordingly considerable care had to be taken in outlining it. 

 The endoderm is, however, much more densely crowded with j'olk- 

 spheres and hence appears as a darker layer more or less clearly 

 marked off from the surrounding lighter mesenchyme. Four 

 visceral-arches are clearly differentiated, the two anterior of which 

 are the mandibular (k.m.) and hyoid (h.m.} arches, while the 

 other two are the first and second branchial -arches. In the former 

 two a somewhat dense patch of mesenchyme can be seen occupying 

 the centre of each. These patches are the Anlagen of the future 

 muscles of these arches (/.-.»). and h.m.). 



An examination of the remaining sections of the series to which 

 fig. 1 belongs, shows that the pharyngeal cavity retains approxi- 

 mately the same size throughout its entire dorso-ventraL extent 

 and that throughout their entire length the visceral-clefts have 

 about the same direction and relations as shown in the figure. 

 Hence we may look upon the clefts as being solid folds of endo- 

 derm, compressed antero-posteriorly and elongated dorso-veutrally. 

 Throughout their entire extent the first three clefts are apparently 

 in contact with the deeper layer of the ectoderm. 



The first or hyomandibular cleft resembles the other clefts in all 

 essential respects, except that it extends slightly forward whereas 

 the second extends transversely outward, while the remaining two 

 course obliquely backward. A section of the cleft in almost any 

 coronal plane presents the condition shown in the figure. Imme- 

 diately dorsal to the outer extremity of the cleft the distal portion 

 of the facial ganglion becomes continuous with the deeper or 

 sensory layer of the ectoderm. 



Stage il (Pis. YI, YII, figs. 2-7).— In this stage all five vis- 

 ceral-clefts are present, none of which opens to the exterior. The 

 mouth is still separated from the pliarynx by the stoniatodeal plate. 

 The external gills have budded forth as two minute, blunt, uudi- 

 vided processes from the sides of the first and second visceral- 

 arches. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 227 



In specimens of the present stage the Anktgen of thfi various 

 structures have so far differentiated that thej' are in most cases 

 readily recognizable. The mesenchyme is less compact than 

 hitherto. The Anlayen of Ihe muscles are particularly well 

 marked out as prominent patches of densely aggregated mesen- 

 chyme cells, containing numerous yolk-spherules. The blood- 

 vessels also have begun to form in the head region. 



PI. VI, figis. 2, 3 and 4 are coronal sections of a tadpole of this 

 stiige. Of these fig. 2 was taken at a plane a slight distance above 

 the floor of the pharynx. Comparing it \\ith fig. 1 we find that 

 anteriorly the stomatodeal invagination (st. ) has deepened very 

 considerably, although as yet not communicating with the pharyn- 

 geal cavity. The latter has much the same form as in fig. 1, 

 except that posteriorly an additional visceral-cleft is present. Of 

 these clefts the most anterior, the hyomandibular (Hym.), can be 

 seen as a narrow, solid diverticulum of the pharyngeal wall, 

 extending outward and terminating bluntly in the mesenchyme a 

 short distance below the external ectoderm. All the remaining 

 cleft outgrowths reach to and blend with the external ectoderm, 

 although as yet not opening to the exterior. Within the body of 

 each of the two anterior visceral-arches— /.e., mandibular and 

 hyoid — the muscles can be made out as irregularly defined patches 

 of denser me.senchyme. That in the mandibular arch is the 

 Anlage of the muscles of mastication {k.m.), while that in the 

 hyoid arch is the Anlarje of the depressor mandibuhe + depressor 

 ossis hyoidei ' (h.m. ). Anterior to the first cleft is a small vessel, 

 the mandibular aortic arch (*«.«.), while on the left of the figure 

 another vessel is to be seen posterior to the cleft. The latter is the 

 hyoidean aortic arch (A.m.). 



PI. VI, fig. 3 is taken at a considerably higher level. On the right 

 side we have passed above the dorsal margins of the visceral-clefts, 

 so that the latter are shown only on the left side. This section 

 passes in a plane approximately on a level with the base of the 

 brain, the small dark patch in the median hue in front of the 

 pharyngeal cavity being the floor of the infundibulum {inf.). 

 The hyomandibular fold can be seen extending outward and slightly 

 forward. It will also be n oticed that its distaP end approaches the 



|Spemann includes these two muscles under the term "orbito-hyoideus."' 

 A word of explanation is necessary concerning my use of the terms "dis- 

 tal and "proximal." Ordinarily these terms are used only in connection

skin more closely than in fig. 2. In fig. 4 we see the fold at its 

 dorsal origin from the pharyngeal wall (Hym.). Here it is to be 

 seen as a rather wide, shallow, blunt diverticulum of the latter. 

 In the sections intervening between this and fig. 3 the distal end 

 progressively moves peripherally as ws pass down until it comes to 

 occupy the position shown in the latter figure. Hence the dorsal 

 edge of the cleft is higher in its proximal portion than in its distal 

 part. In fig. 4 it will also be noticed that the proximal portion of 

 the cleft in its dorsal portion approaches very closely to the origin 

 of the second visceral-oleft. In the other two figures the cleft is 

 separated throughout by a considerable interval from the second 

 cleft. It follows from this; that as it descends the plane of the 

 first cleft moves forward also. 



Grouping the facts so far obtained we find the hyomandibular 

 cleft as a solid, two-layered diverticulum of the pharyngeal wall, 

 which extends outward and somewhat forward to a point a short 

 distance removed from the external ectoderm. Here it terminates 

 in a blunt, rounded edge, extending downward and slightly for- 

 ward and presenting throughout its course no well-marked indenta- 

 tions or depressions. Above and below, however, the outer edge 

 gradually recedes more and more from the skin until it blends 

 imperceptibly with the lining of the pharyngeal cavity. The edge 

 thus has the form of a gentle arch. In general the cleft outgrowth 

 is elongated dorso-ventrally, but it also is directed obliquely for- 

 ward. This forward direction is more pronounced in its dorsal 

 than in its ventral portion. In its lower portion the cleft is widely 

 separated from the second visceral-cleft, but in its dorso-postcrior 

 portion it approaches the latter very closely, particularly in ils 

 proximal, internal part. 



These observations are further confirmed by transverse sections 

 (Pis. VI, VII, figs. 5-7). In fig. -5 the hyomandibular cleft can be 

 seen as a short, blunt diverticulum from the inferior, outer angle of 

 the pharynx {Hym. ). The cleft here is cut through its antero- 



■with processes er appendages of the boity. In the present paper, however, 

 I designate by "distal" that poition of the hyomaudibiiliir fold (or of its 

 derivative the Eustachian (ord) which is farthest removed from lis con- 

 nection with the pharvux, while I en.ph)y the term " proximal " to denote 

 that part of the same structure which is nearest the point of oriKin Irom 

 the pharynx My u^e of thc-e terms in conneoiion with tlie structure men- 

 tioned is due to the necessity of having some fixed term to apply to each of 

 its extremities, the relative position of which vary in the different stages. 




1901.] NATURAL SCJENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 229 



ventral portion. In the fifth section posterior to this (fig. G) the 

 cleft is cut throughout the greater part of its dorso-ventral extent, 

 and hence appears as a broad, solid mass extending out from the 

 side of the pharynx and reaching nearly to the skin, where it all 

 but meets a slight papilla projecting inward from the latter 

 {Hym.). This figure also reveals another feature of the cleft- 

 outgrowth which is of particular importance. Ii will be noted that 

 it is the upper jjortion of the cleft-fold which approaches most 

 nearly the skin, whereas the ventral portion recedes gradually 

 from it as we descend. About the middle of this ventral portion 

 is a small indentation in the outer edge occupied by a small 

 blood-vessel (:i-.). It will be also noticed that the proximal (inner) 

 portion of the cleft is situated at a higher level than in fig. 5. 

 From this it follows that the line of origin of the fold from the 

 pharynx extends from below upward and backward. 



Posterior to this region the hyomandibular fold bends more 

 sharply backward and accordingly in transverse section appears 

 <5onsiderably narrower (fig. 7, Hym., right side). We next obtain 

 the c;>udition shown in fig. 5 (left side), where the fold (Hym.) ig 

 cut ap])roximately at right angles to its surface and hence appears 

 ■extremely narrow. Below the fold is a large oval mass, the 

 Anlage of the hyoidean muscles, i.e., depressor mandibuke and 

 depressor ossis hyoidei (h.m.). Spemaun has noticed a relation 

 between the sulisequent development of these muscles and the 

 degeneration of the hyomandibular fold. I have found the same 

 relation to exist in Bufo, but shall call attention to it' later. The 

 fold next enlarges somewhat, and then, gr.idiially receding more 

 and more from the exterior, blends imperceptibly with the pharyn- 

 geal wall. These stages are shown consecutively in figs. 6 and 7 

 (left sides). 



The transverse sections also show some structural features, which 

 are of impurlauce in tracing certain stages in the subsequent his- 

 tory of the cleft-fold. Anterior to the cleft is the efferent man- 

 dibular aortic artery, a branch from the carotid. At the present 

 stage this vessel is rather difficult to trace, but with some care can 

 be worked out. Since, owing to the general antero-ventral direc- 

 tion taken by the plane of the hj'omandibular fold, the anterior 

 wall of the latter faces forward and also upward, it follows that in 

 transverse section structures anterior to the fold will be seen dorsal 




•230 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Marcll, 



to it. Thus iu the figures the region immediately dorsal to the fold 

 is the maadibular arch, whereas that ventral to it is the hyoid 

 arch. In fig. 7 the efferent portion of the mandibular aortic arch 

 can be seen as a transversely placed vessel (m.a'.) just above the 

 roof of the pharynx and extending outward above the hyoman- 

 dibular diverticulum. Internally the vessel unites with the carotid 

 (ear.). The course of the mandibular aortic arch can be followed 

 by comparing the figures. At first it is very small, as seen in fig. 

 5 (m.a'.). Tracing it forward, however, it is soon found to be 

 continuous with a much larger vessel with a well-marked lumen. 

 This vessel is the afferent portion of the mandibular aortic arch 

 (m.a"). Immediately beneath the antero-iuferior extremity of the 

 hyomandibular fold the mandibular aoitic arch is joined by the 

 hyoidean aortic arch, and the common trunk thus formed communi- 

 cates with the large inferior jugular sinuses beneath the mouth. 



The other structure to which I desire to call attention is the 

 hyomandibular ramus of the facial nerve. The facial ganglion at 

 present lies just back of and above the dorsal margin of^ the 

 hyomandibular fold. The anterior edge of the ganglion is in 

 actual contact with the outer margin of the fold (fig. 7, vH ). 

 From the ventral surface of the ganglion the hyomandibular ramus 

 (fig. 6, vii h. ) is given off as a large nerve supplying the muscles 

 of the hyoid arch. It is hence posterior to the hyomandibular 



fold. 



Stage III (Fh. VII, VIII, figs. 10-14, 16-18).— Youngtadpole. 

 External gills prominent and considerably branched, not covered as 

 yet to any marked extent by the opercular fold. Third visceral- 

 cleft opening to the exterior. Mouth communicating with pharynx. 

 The tail has attained its full development. 



A considerable departure from the conditions observed in the 

 preceding stage is shown in the present. The different organs are 

 quite clearly differentiated, while the Anhtgen of the more impor- 

 tant cartilages can be made out as dense aggregations of the mesen- 

 chyme. The first visceral-cleft especially has undergone marked 

 modifications. We can follow out its course by comparing figs. 

 10-14. Consulting fig. 10, we notice that the pharyngeal wall is 

 separated from the exterior by a considerable interval occupied by 

 scattered mesenchyme cells, which in the region immediately sur- 

 rounding the pharynx are segregating to form the Anhigen of the 




1901.] XATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 231 



skeletal structures. Since it will be necessary hereafter in study- 

 ing the development of the Eustachian tube to take into consider- 

 ation the modifications undergone by the neighboring skeletal 

 parts, it may be well to point out these parts in the present stage. 

 The very dense segregated mass which may be seen in fig. 10 

 (M. and Q.), immediately external to and beneath the pharynx, ia 

 the Aiilage of the cartilaginous mandibular arch. That portioa 

 of the arch which underlies the pharynx is the mandibular or 

 Meckel's cartilage (J/.), while that external to it is the quadrate 

 or suspeusorium (Q.). In the figure there is no distinct separation 

 between these two portions, but more anteriorly the mandibular 

 Anlaye can be seen to be separated from the quadrate by a slight 

 space in which the mesenchyme cells are less densely aggregated 

 (fig. 11, 3/.— shown here owing to the oblique section, the left 

 side being cut more aateriorly than the right). lu fig. 10 (J/.) 

 only the most posterior part of the mandible can be seen. The 

 mandible, as in all anurau tadpoles, extends transversely beneath 

 the floor of the mouth. External to the lateral wall of the 

 pharynx (right side) is the quadrate cartilage (§.), which ven- 

 trally becomes continuous with the mandible and at the same point 

 sends upward and outward a strong process, the orbital process or 

 processus muscularis (P/-.J/.) (Gaupp). This process with the 

 inner portion of the quadrate forms a deep concavity, underlying 

 the e3'e and. containing the muscles of mastication. That portion 

 of the quadrate which lies in contact with the pharyngeal wall is 

 the palato-pterygoid process or commissura quadralo-cranialis ante- 

 rior of Gaupp (fig. 11, Pi-.q.c.a.). At its dorsal extremity this 

 part approaches, but is still separated from, a patch of dense tissue 

 in immediate contact with the dorso-lateral border of the pharynx, 

 the AnliKje of the trabecula cranii (Tr.). 



On the right side of fig. 11 (fourth section posterior to that of 

 fig. 10), the mandibular cartilage has been passed, and in its stead 

 we find a very slight aggregation of mesenchyme forming a portion 

 of the cartilaginous hyoid bar. The traiiecula cranii of the same 

 side has become much less distinct, and in the third section follow- 

 ing (fig. 12) has ceased to be any longer distinguishable from the 

 surrounding mesenchyme. The trabecule cranii at present are 

 thus marked out only in their more anterior portion. Of the 

 quadrate cartilage we have only the body with its processus mus-

cularis, having passed beyond the transversely placed commissure 

 quadrato-cranialis anterior (palato-pterygoid). Of the quadrate 

 the outer, distal portion of the processas muscularis is most dis- 

 tinct at the present stage. Above this process are the muscles of 

 mastication (k.m.) already mentioned, while to its outer or ventral 

 surface are attached two muscles, the depressor mandibulae 

 {m.d.m.) and depressor ossis hyoidei {m.d.h.). Between these 

 two muscles courses the ramus hyomandibularis of the facial nerve 

 (m h.). Both of these muscles belong to the hyoid or second 

 visceral-arch and have been differentiated out of the common 

 muscle mass of that arch. 



The quadrate in the region posterior to that just considered 

 blends gradually and imperceptibly with the surrounding mesen- 

 chyme. This can be followed by examining the figures consecu- 

 tively. 



We will now turn to the consideration of the hyomandibular 

 fold in the present stage. In fig. 12 the rhomboidal cavity of 

 the pharynx is sharply prolonged at its right ventro-lateral angle, 

 and from the wall of the cavity immediately above this prolonga- 

 tion a narrow, solid cord, representing an extension of the wall, 

 extends upward and outward in close contact with the ventral sur- 

 face of the processus muscularis (Eu.) . Just internal to its blind, 

 distal extremity can be seen a small vessel interposed between the 

 cord and the cartilage. This vessel is the mandibular .aortic arch. 

 Ventral to the cord is a semicircular mass of precartilage, in the 

 hollow of which is placed the depressor mandibulre. This is the 

 Anlage of the hvoid, a more complete view of which c^n be 

 obtained in fig. 13 (//.). The hyoid, like the mandible, is a stout, 

 thick bar placed transversely beneath the floor of the pharynx and 

 separated from its fellow in the raid-line by a less compact tissue. 

 Anteriorly the two are separated by the thyroid gland outgrowth 

 (T/i.). At its outer extremity the hyoid turns sharply upward 

 as a flattened plate with a concave outer surface in which is lodged, 

 as already mentiouL-.l, the depressor mandibul«. Its inner surface 

 is closely applied to the outer and ventral wall of the hyomandib- 

 ular fold (^».). 



In the region posterior to that shown in fig. 12 the hyomandd)u- 

 lar fold presents much the same appearance as in the last stage 

 (compare figs. 13 and 14 with and 7). It will be noticed, how-

€ver, that the fold is considerably narrower than in the preceding 

 stage, and also that its distal extremity is much farther removed 

 from the external surface. This condition will be more fully con- 

 sidered presently. The narrowing of the fold, however, is more 

 apparent than real. If one will bear in mind the statement 

 already made that the fold extends downward and obliquely for- 

 ward, a true explanation of the difference will suggest itself. 

 Naturally a section which passes through in the same plane as that 

 of the fold will show the latter as a broad mass. This explains 

 the appearance of the fold as shown in fig. 6 (right side). In this 

 figure the section on the right side passes through the eye, whereas 

 on the left side it passes some distance behind the eye. Hence the 

 section traverses the right side in an obliquely forward direction, 

 thus coinciding in the main with the plane of the fold. In the 

 same specimen the fold on the left side is cut throughout trans- 

 versely, so that, except in its most posterior portion, it appears as 

 a narrow, two-layered lamina. 



It is in its distal anterior portion that the hyoraaudibular fold 

 has undergone its greatest modification. In fig. 12 the fold is 

 continuous with the wall of the jdiarynx. In fig. 11, which is the 

 third section anterior to that of fig. 12, this connection no longer 

 exists. The fold appears as a solid, somewhat flattened cord 

 (Eu.), closely underlying the upper, outer extremity of the pro- 

 cessus muscularis. Its internal surface is in intimate contact with 

 the mandibular aortic arch {m.a.), while externally the two muscles 

 of the hyoid arch — i.e., depressor mandibulte {m.d.m.) and depres- 

 sor ossis hyoidei (m.d.h.) — approach it very closely. The proxi- 

 mal portion of the anterior part of the fold can be seen in the 

 figure as a relatively broad diverticulum from the wall of the 

 outer, inferior angle of the pharynx (Hym.'). 



Anterior to the region just considered this cord-like extension of 

 the fold extends forward a short distance and then bends sharply 

 outward in front of the two muscles just mentioned (fig. 18, Hym., 

 right side). In this region it enlarges considerably and finally 

 terminates as a blind, bulbous swelling in the mesenchyme a short 

 distance below the external epithelium. This part is shown in fig. 

 10 (Tym.), also in fig. 17 (^Tym.). 



Perhaps a clearer conception of the state of the fold may be 

 gained by a comparison with some coronal sections. In fig. 16 "we 




234 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



have such a section, in which, however, the plane is lower ou the 

 right side than on the left. Commencing below, we observe on the 

 right of the figure a shorl, blunt diverticulum of the pharyngeal 

 wall, extending outward and slightly forward between the Anktfjen 

 of the mandibular and hyoid cartilages. This part corresponds 

 to broad proximal portion of the fold shown in fig. 11 as continu- 

 ous with the pharyngeal wall. In the fourth section dorsal to this 

 (fig. 17) the same portion of the fold is still seen, and just exter- 

 nal to its distal extremity is an elongated strand of like nature 

 (jH/jk. ), somewhat swollen in its outer portion, where it terminates 

 just beneath the external epithelium. This part is the swollen 

 portion of the cletl, which, as already mentioned, extends out in 

 front of the hyoidean muscles and forms the distal expanded por- 

 tion of the cord-like extension of the fold. In the second section 

 above this (fig. 18) these two parts of the fold join, so that it now 

 appears continuous throughout (Hi/m.). The present section gives 

 a very good view of the course taken by the hyomandibular fold. 

 One will observe that it has a very broad origin from the pharyn- 

 geal wall, and that from this point it extends outward and also 

 considerably forward. In its middle portion the fold is consider- 

 ably constricted, while in its distal outer extreiiiity it is enlarged to 

 form the swollen, bulbous ijortion which curves outward in frout 

 of the hyoidean muscles, as is well shown in the figure. 



One notices that in fig. 18 the outer, distal extremity of the 

 fold is farther removed from the exterior than in fig. 17. If the 

 left side of fig. 16 (Hym.) — which represents a plane slightly 

 more dorsal than that of the right of fig. 18 — be now consulted it 

 will bs seen that this portion is still farther removed from the 

 exterior, and by comparing the same fold {Hym.) in the following 

 two figures (17 and 18) the distance between the two will be seen 

 to be still more, increased. In the latter two figures the fold 

 approaches very closely the proximal portion of the second visceral- 

 cleft {.J v.f.) — a feature to which we have already called attention. 



Bringing together the facts so far obtained relating to the third 

 stage, we shall now endeavor to form a conception of the hyoman- 

 dibular fold as a whole. It arises as a solid fold of the wall of 

 the pharynx and extends downward and obliquely forward as a 

 thin plate between the first and second visceral-arches. Its origin 

 from the pharyux extends downward and forward, beginning above 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 235 



just anterior to the dorsal origin of tlie second visceral-cleft (figs. 

 14, 17, 18, Hi/iii.) and terminating at the position of the future 

 quadi-ato- mandibular articulation (fig. 10, Ifym.). The outer or 

 distal border begins dorsally in continuity with the roof of the 

 pharynx (fig. 14, Hym.), and then extends in a gentle curv<i 

 downward, outward and forward until it reaches the point where 

 the distal, cord-like e.Ktensiou is given oft and which I shall now 

 designate as the " diverticulum." The latter is at first a flattened 

 cord (fig. 11, Eu.), which at first extends forward a short dis- 

 tance, but, when it reaches the anterior border of the depressor 

 ossis hyoidei, turns sharply outward and slightly downward in 

 front of the latter and then expands to form a solid, bulbous 

 swelling, which terminates blindly in the mesenchyme a short dis- 

 tance below the external ectoderm (figs. 10, 17, Tym.; also fig. 

 18, Hym.). This portion of the hyoraandibular fold is the only 

 part which comes into close proximity with the external epithelium. 

 The remainder of the fold lies at a considerably deeper level. The 

 distal border of the latter, below the origin of the " diverticu- 

 lum," bends downward and inward and at its ventral end blends 

 with the floor of the pharynx (figs. 10, 11, Hym.; 12, 13, 14, 

 Hym. [leftside]; 16, 17 [right]). This portion of the distal 

 border is continuous with the ventral border of the " diverticu- 

 lum," and, owing to the slightly downward direction taken by the 

 latter, forms with it a shallow sinus or depression, the concavity 

 of which faces downward and outward. By its anterior surface the 

 hyomandibular fold is in close contact with the quadrate, although 

 partly separated from it by the mandibular aortic arch {m.a.}. 

 Owing to the obliquely anterior direction taken by the hyoman- 

 dibular fold, this surface faces both forward and upward, so that 

 in transverse sections it appears as the dorsal border. Hence it 

 follows that all structures found above the fold are anterior to it, 

 whereas those ventral to it are posterior. The posterior surface 

 faces backward and downward and has in close relation the An lageit 

 of the hyoid cartilage and associated muscles. Between the two 

 muscles is the ramus hyomandibularis of the facial nerve (vii h.} 

 whieii occupies its definitive position posterior to the hyomandibu- 

 lar fold.' 



'The reader will do well to consult figure 3 of Dr. Spemann's piper, 

 which shows a reconstruction of the hyomandibular fold of Hana temporn'riu 

 at a similar stage. I find that the fold in Bufo lentiginosus is in all essen- 

 tial respects similar. 




236 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



It now remains for us to point out the diSereuces between the 

 hyomandibular fold in the present and preceding stages and, if 

 possible, to ascertain how such differences have been produced. 

 In the first place, one will recall that the outer border of the fold 

 in the last stage described a gentle curve, arching from above 

 downward and forward, and that throughout the greater part of its 

 length this border approached very closely the external epiblast._ 

 In the present stage the arch described by the outer border is 

 interrupted about its middle by a club-shaped " diverticulum," 

 which, again, is the onl}' portion of the fold which approaches 

 closely the external epithelium. The remainder of the outer bor- 

 der lies a considerable distance below the skin. Again, a compari- 

 son of coronal sections shows that the anterior extension of the 

 fold is more marked than in the earlier stage. Hence there are 

 at least three differences to be accounted for, i.e., (1) the recession 

 of the outer border of the fold from the external epithelium; (2) 

 the formatioii of the blind, distal " diverticulum," which still 

 retains the original position of the fold near the skin, and (3) 

 the more anterior direction taken by the fold. 



In order to account for these changes it is evident that at least 

 two factors must be borne in mind. These are ( 1 ) the growth 

 process — i.e., the general increase in size of the parts in accordance 

 with the growth of the individual — and (2) the differentiation of 

 new structures. First, as regards the recession of the outer border 

 of the fold from the skin : By comparing the figures illustrating 

 the two stages, one will observe (hat a considerable increase in the 

 transverse diameter of the head has taken place, whereas little, if 

 any, increase has occurred in the vertical plane. On the other 

 hand the pharynx has not increased concomitantly in size, but, 

 instead, has undergone an actual decrease, so that it is not only 

 relatively, but also absolutely, smaller in size than in the earlier 

 stage. However, between the points of origin of the hyoman- 

 dibular fold the pharyngeal cavity retains approximately its orig- 

 inal width, a feature due to the fact that in this region it forms a 

 pair of shallow evagiuations (fig. 16). The smaller size of the 

 pharyngeal cavity can be readily made out in the transverse sec- 

 tions (compare figs. 5-7 with 10-14). This reduction is in all 

 probability connected with the increase in amount of mesenchyme 

 and particularly with the segregation of the latter to form the Aula- 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 237 



gen of the cartilages and muscles. The cartilages are laid dowu 

 close to the wall of the pharynx, and with their increase in size the 

 latter is naturally reduced; while at the same time the increase in 

 amount of the general mesenchyme accounts for the increase iu 

 width of the entire head. 



As a consequence of the retarded growth of the pharynx and of 

 the increase in width of the head it follows that, unless there i.s 

 sufficient rapidity of growth in the fold to compensate for the 

 arrested growth of the pharynx, the distal extremity of the 

 hyomandibular fold will be removed more and more from the exte- 

 rior and that ultimately it will come to lie quite deeply. To such 

 causes, I think, "must be attributed the recession of the hyoman- 

 dibular fold from the exterior. The head has increased in width, 

 while the pharynx has remained stationary, and even been reduced 

 in size, so that its appendage, the fold, quite naturally recedes from 

 the ectoderm. 



But this explanation suggests another problem: Why does the 

 fold not exhibit sufficient rapidity of growth to enable it to retain 

 throughout its original position near the external epithelium, as in 

 the case of the remaining visceral-clefts, and, moreover, why does 

 it retain this position at one point, i.e., where the blind, bulbous 

 "diverticulum" terminates? This question brings us to our 

 second topic — the formation of the " diverticulum." This part is 

 not, I consider, a new formation, but merely that portion of the 

 fold which has managed by its normal growth to retain its original 

 position near the ectoderm. In this connection I wish again to 

 call attention to the condition iu stage II. The distal border then 

 formed a gentle arch, which for a considerable part of its extent 

 was in close proximity to the skin. However, at both its dorsal 

 and ventral extremities this border recedes progressively more and 

 more from the exterior until finally it blends at both ends with 

 the lining of the pharynx. Hence in sections the dnrsal and 

 ventral portions of the distal border are seen at varying levels 

 below the ectoderm, while the crown (of the arched plate) is situ- 

 ated near the latter (compare figs. 2-7). Fig. 6 is instructive in 

 this connection. Take the fold as shown on the right side. It will 

 be seen that the distal edge is in close proximity to the ectoderm 

 for a considerable part of its length. However, the upper portion 

 of this border is closer to the ectoderm than the remainder. This 




238 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEJIY OF [March, 



part represents a region sliglitly dorsal to the middle portion of the 

 distal border. Below this the edge recedes to a slight extent from 

 the exterior and in its middle portion forms a slight, barely per- 

 ceptible depression. If we now conceive that in the future growth 

 of the animal all the lower portion of the distal edge remains 

 stationary and that the middle depression deepens considerably, 

 while the upper portion alone remains in proximity to the ecto- 

 derm, then we should obtain a condition very similar to that shown 

 in fig. 12, except that complete outward extension of the fold is 

 not shown in the figure (see instead fig. 10). In fig. 12 the 

 arrested ventral poi'tion can be seen as an extension of the right 

 inferior angle of the pharynx, while the concavity between it and 

 the plate-like hyomandibular fold is the much-deepened depression 

 (see also fig. 11). In the latter figure the lower portion of the 

 fold can be seen as a blunt extension from the ventro-lateral wall 

 of the pharynx, while the flattened, oval mass external to and 

 above it is the dorsal portion, or, as we have temporarily termed 

 it, the " diverticulum." More posteriorly, as shown in fig. 12, 

 this " diverticulum " becomes continuous with the proximal por- 

 tion of the fold, and accordingly the area embraced between these 

 two portions anteriorly represents the depression, which we saw 

 beginning iu fig. 6. Oue will notice that in this area a muscle — 

 the depressor mandibulre (m.d.m.) —has just attained attachment 

 to the Anlage of the quadrate cartilage, while external to it its 

 companion muscle, the depressor ossis hyoidei (in.d.h.), has 

 acquired attachment to the tip of the processus muscularis. The 

 "diverticulum" lies between these two muscles and, as already 

 mentioned, extends anteriorly between them until it reaches the 

 anterior surface of the outer muscle (depressor ossis hyoidei), 

 around which it curves outward (fig. 10, also 17 and 18). In the 

 behavior of these two muscles lies the clue to the solution of the 

 problem under consideration. One will recall that both of these 

 muscles belong originally to the hyoid arch, and consequently their 

 acquirement of attachment to the quadrate is a later affair. In 

 stage II the original hyoidean muscle-mass, from which these two 

 are subsequently differentiated, extends in its long axis almost 

 vertically and is situated entirely behind the Hyomandibular fold 

 (see. figs. 2-7). Later, however, as the muscle increases in size 

 its long axis becomes extended iu an obliquely anterior direction, 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 239 



the superior border facing forward. At this time the oominou 

 muscle divides into an inner and anterior mass, the depressor luau- 

 dibuhe, and an outer and posterior mass, the depressor ossis 

 hyoidei. With subsequent growth both muscles extend forward 

 more and more until one of them — the depressor mandibular — 

 invades the area intervening between the skin and the inferior por- 

 tion of the distal edge of the hyomandibular fold at the point 

 indicated by the slight depression shown in fig. 6 (.i). Here its 

 anterior extremity comes into close relation with the segregating 

 Anlage of the quadrate at a point just in front of and below the 

 fold. The outer muscle — the depressor ossis hyoidei — also acquires 

 attachment to the quadrate Anlarje, but at a point above and pos- 

 terior to the fold. 



I have just mentioned that the depressor mandibula? extends for- 

 ward in the space between the lower portion of ihe distal border 

 of the hyomandibular fold and the skin. With this invasion au 

 eHective barrier is interposed between the two ; and as a result of 

 the subsequent increase in size of the muscle and of the extension 

 in width of the head, il follows that this lower portion of the 

 hyomandibular fold will be arrested in its growth and will conse- 

 quently come to be more and more removed from the exterior. 

 At the same time the segregation of the mesenchyme to form carti- 

 lage ^w/ar/eji interposes additional barriers to the outward growth of 

 the fold. Hence it is possible to understand why it is that the 

 lower part of the fold should lie so far beneath the ectoderm as 

 shown in the present stage (tigs. 11, 16, 17). On the other hand, 

 the dorsal portion of the hyomandibular fold — i.e., that which 

 forms the " diverticulum "- — is situated above the depressor man- 

 dibuhe, so that the latter does not interfere with its normal grcwth 

 and as a result this portion of the fold still retains its proximity to 

 the skin. With the increase in width of the head it has been carried 

 outward with the skin. In its proximal portion, however, this 

 part also has been encroached upon by the developing depressor 

 mandibuke, and as a result it presents the form of a long-drawn- 

 out cord, narrow and flattened in its proximal part and swollen in 

 its terminal part, where it is not encroached upon to any great 

 extent by the surrounding structures. 



Along the dorsal edge of the fold no well-marked changes, so 

 far as I have been able to determine, feera to have taken place. 




240 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Marcll, 



lu the figures (particularly figs. 17 and 18 [leftside]) one will 

 notice that the distal extremity is removed some distance from the 

 skin, but this appearance, I consider, is simply produced by the 

 obliquely veutral direction taken by the dorsal border, as has been 

 already described. 



This brings us to our third problem, i.e., the more pronounced 

 anterior extension of the fold. This, I consider, is correlated with 

 the growth anteriorly of the two hyoidean muscles. Naturally as 

 these extend forward they carry the fold with them. As a result 

 of this the posterior surface of the fold comes to face outward, and 

 the anterior inward. Hence in transverse sections structures 

 external to the fold are also morphologically posterior, whilst 

 those internal to it are morphologically anterior (compare trans- 

 verse with coronal sections of present stage). 



Stage IV. — Young tadpole. Opercular fold well developed, 

 ending freely posteriorly and with the ends of the external gills 

 protruding, beyond its posterior margin. The various tissues for 

 the most part clearly differentiated. True cartilage developed in 

 the mandibular and hyoid arches (PI. VIII, figs. 15, 19; PI. IX, 

 figs. 23, 24). 



Beginning anteriorly the distal, blind extremity of the " diver- 

 ticulum ' ' appears as a transversely extended cord of cells, some- 

 what expanded distally, lying in the loose mesenchyme some dis- 

 tance below the external epithelium (fig. 24, Tijm.). This cord is 

 clearly distinguished from the surrounding fibrous tissue by its 

 greater density, which naturally causes it to stain more deeply, 

 and also by the presence within its substance of yolk spherules and 

 numerous pigment granules, similar to those found in the raucous 

 membrane of the pharynx. In the present stage the yolk spher- 

 ules, although still present, are much less numerous than in the 

 earlier stages and they soon disappear altogether, so that the dark 

 pigment becomes the distinguishing feature of the cord. The 

 lower proximal portion of the hyomandibular fold can be seen in 

 the figure as a shallow protrusion {Hyin.) from the ventrodateral 

 angle of the pharynx (compare with figs. 10 and 11). In the 

 region immediately posterior the proximal portion is practically 

 blended with the wall of the pharynx (figs. 15 and 19). In fig. 

 19 (right side) it again becomes distinguishable and goon becomes 

 continuous with the prominent diverticulum Eu. (left side of fig. 19). 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 241 



I will now return to the " diverticulum " in order to trace its 

 further course. From its distal extremity the " diverticulum " 

 extends inward and slightly backward in close contact with the 

 anterior surface of the depressor ossis hyoidei (wi.d. A., fig. 24, 

 Ti/m.), and then ascending slightly to pass over a large vessel, the 

 mandibular aortic arch (»i.«.), it comes into close relation with 

 the external surface of the processus muscularis of the quadrate. 

 As it progresses inward the cord gradually decreases in diameter, so 

 that when it reaches the quadrate it is reduced to about a half or 

 even a third of the diameter of its distal expanded portion. 



After reaching the external surface of the quadrate the reduced 

 " diverticulum " turus sharply posteriorly at the inner edge of the 

 depressor ossis hyoidei as a minute, cylindrical cord, (figrs. 23, 15, 

 19, Eu.). Here it is closely applied to the processus muscularis 

 of the quadrate. Below and internal to it is the mandibular 

 aortic arch (m. a.), while bounding it externally is a small, acces- 

 foryslip from the depressor mandibulse (fig. 15, m.d.m'.), the main 

 body of which is attached to the quadrate anterior and internal to 

 the cord (fig. 24, m.d.m.). The cord extends posteriorly in the 

 same position, usually closely applied to the quadrate, and showing 

 more or less reduction in size, so that in certain parts of its course 

 it is difficult to trace clearly. Throughout its entire extent, how- 

 ever, it contains numerous pigment granules, the jjresence of 

 which facilitates considerablj' the tracing of the cord, as does also 

 the scattered yolk-bodies apparent for the last time in the present 

 stage. 



In fig. 15 the cord can be seen, much reduced, just under the 

 transversely extended processus muscularis and external to the 

 mandibular aortic arch (in. a.). In fig. 19 (right side) the cord 

 (£■«.) still occupies the same relative position. Just external to it 

 is the ramus hyomandibularis of the facial nerve (I'u A.). Inter- 

 nal to it the mandibular artery (m.a. ) intervenes between it and 

 the pharyngeal wall. At this point the mandibular aortic arch 

 begins to turn inward in order to reach the carotid. Immediately 

 behind the artery the cord fuses with the distal extremity of the 

 diverticulum extending up from the pharyngeal wall (see fig. 19. 

 Eu., left sidej. Here both the cord and proximal portion of the 

 hyomandibular fold become continuous. The fold becomes more 

 prominent in the following sections (fig. 23, Eu.) and ultimately 

 16 




242 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



blends with the wall of the pharynx doi-sal to the inner opening 

 of the first branchial-cleft. 



To recapitulate briefly the state of the hyomandibular fold at 

 the present stage : we have found the ventral portion of the fold 

 present only as an inconspicuous protrusion of the ventro-lateral 

 angle of the pharynx. Only the dorsalmost portion of the orig- 

 inal fold is well developed, and from this the greatly prolonged 

 " diverticulum " extends forward .as a solid cord of cells. The 

 latter originates posterior to the quadrato-hyoid articulation. 

 Throughout the grealer part of its length the cord is closely applied 

 to the° outer surface of the processus muscularis. Anteriorly, 

 however, it bcuds sharply outward in front of the depressor ossis 

 hyoidei and terminates blindly as a somewhat bulbous enlargement 

 in the subcutaneous tissue. 



I may here describe briefly the condition of the neighboring 

 skeletal structures, since in the present stage these have acquired 

 the relations- which they retain throughout the entire larval period. 

 The animal has now passed beyond the pro-cartilage stage and 

 consequently the cartilages can be readily traced. In most cases 

 they already show a well-defined perichondrium. The quadrate 

 cartilage is prolonged in an antero-posterior direction almost parallel 

 with the corresponding trabecula cranii. Its coui-se is thus quite 

 the reverse of that which characterizes its adult condition. Its 

 distal articular end is prolonged as the processus articularis down- 

 ward and forward to a point beneath the anterior surface of the 

 eye and at a later period still farther forward. At its distill 

 extremity it bears the transversely placed mandibular cartilage 

 (Meckel's). The greater part of the quadrate is prolonged 

 upward and outward as a stout i)late immediately underlying the 

 orbit— the processus muscularis— to the outer side of which are 

 attached the depressor mandibuhv and depressor ossis hyoidei. In 

 the concavity formed in the inner (and upper) surface are lodged 

 the muscles of mastication (fig. 24, Lm.). On the ventral surface 

 near the point of junction between the body of the cartilage and 

 the processus muscularis there is forming at the present stage a 

 shallow, concave articular surface for the head of the hyoid car- 

 tilage. The latter is a stout bar of cartilage extending tran.-^- 

 versely beneath the floor of the pharynx and joined to it* fellow 

 of the opposite side by the intervention of a median plate, the 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 243 



copula. In its outer portion the hyoid turns sharply upward to 

 form au ascending process, which articulates with the quadrate. 



In its anterior portion — i.e., where the processus articularis is 

 given off — the quadrate is joined to the trabecula of the same side 

 by an ascending bar of cartilage, the commissura quadrato-cranialis 

 anterior (Gaupp) or palato-pterygoid bar. Posteriorly again the 

 •quadrate bends sharply upward and then as a stout bar (processus 

 ascendens, fig. 19, Pr.A.) extends inward back of the eye and in 

 front of the auditory capsule to join with the trabecula just in 

 front of the basilar plate (parachordal). There is no distinct 

 separation between these connected cartilages, the matrix of each 

 being perfectly continuous with that of tiie others. 



It now remains to connect the conditions observed in the present 

 stage with those seen in the preceding. The chief diflferences 

 between the former and the latter are briefly these: (1) The rela- 

 tively much greater length of tl e " diverticulum," a condition asso- 

 ciated with the removal of the part connecting it with the 

 pharyngeal wall to a point more posterior, i. e. , back of the quadrato- 

 hyoid aiticulatiou; (2) the reduction in size of the middle portion 

 of the " diverticulum," and (.3) the almost complete obliteration 

 of the ventro-anterior portion of the hyomandibular fold. 



These differences are, I believe, correlated with a continuation of 

 the same processes treated of under the description of the pre- 

 ceding stage. These are chiefly the modifications undergone by 

 the neighboring muscles and cartilages. The general growth of 

 the animal has had little, if anything, to do in producing the 

 differences between the two stages. Tliere has been a considerable 

 inorea.«e in width of the head — au increase in which, however, the 

 contained structures have taken part. The greatta- length of the 

 " diverticulum " has been produced by the continued increase in 

 depth of the depression in the distal border of the fold. In stage 

 III this depression was relatively shallow, so that the " diverticu- 

 lum " was very short aud blunt. In the present stage the 

 " diverticulum " is very long, having the form of a long, narrow 

 cord somewhat expanded at its distal extremity. The insinking 

 of the disial border was associated with the growth of the depressor 

 raandibulas, in consequence of the latter's acquisition of a point of 

 attachment to the quadrate in front of and below the distal border 

 of the hyomandibular fold. In the present stage this muscle has 




244 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEJIY OF [March, 



increased iu size aud extended its area of attachment to the quad- 

 rate. It has also given off au accessory slip, which extends 

 upward external to the cord-like "diverticulum" to attach to 

 the processus muscularis (fig. 15, m.d.m'.). Moreover, immedi- 

 ately behind the posterior edge of the depressor raaudibulce, the 

 hyoid cartilage is drawn up to form an articulation with the quad- 

 rate, and following this the enlarged mandibular aortic arch turns 

 inward to join with the carotid (fig. 19, m.a.) just in front of the 

 point where the " diverticulum " joins the extension from the 

 pharyngeal wall (fig. 19, £u., left side). Thus changes in three 

 structures have been instrumental in producing the deepening of 

 the depression, i.e., (1) the increase in size and area of attach- 

 ment of the depressor mandibulte; (2) the articulation of the 

 hyoid to the quadrate, and (3) the increase in size of the man- 

 dibular aortic arch. 



The reduction in size of the middle portion of the " diverticu- 

 lar" cord, (compare figures with fig. 11 of last stage) has been 

 associated with two factors: (1) the increase in size of the accom- 

 panying mandibular aorta, and (2) the differentiation and growth 

 of the outer, accessory slip of the depressor mandibulaj. By 

 examining figure 15, one will notice the reduced cord tightly 

 wedged in between the enlarged artery internally and the accessory 

 slip externally. 



The decrease of the ventro-anterior portion of the liyomandibular 

 fold to form a mere shallow ju'Dtrusion of the ventro -lateral angle 

 of the pharynx (fig. 24, Mym.) has in all probability been pro- 

 duced by the deepening of the depression and its final blending 

 with the pharyngeal wall. Naturally, as the depression deepened 

 its deepest part would ultimately blend with the pharyngeal wall, 

 so as to be no longer distinguishable (fig. 15). As the ventro- 

 anterior portion of the fold formed the lower border of the depres- 

 sion, it would natui'ally be drawn in with the deepening of the 

 depression until it formed the shallow protrusion mentioned (fig. 

 24, lltjm.'). This decrease is also accelerated by the increase in 

 size and density of the skeletal and muscular parts. 



Stage V. — Young tadpole of about 9 mm. Opercular cavity 

 communicating with the exterior by a single opening on the left 

 side. Xo external gills. 



The condition of tiie hyoinandibuiar fold is essentially similar to 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 245 



that in the preceding stage. Tiie ti.ssues of the animal are more 

 compact and definitely limited than iu, the last stage. The 

 external, distal extremity of the " diverticulum" (or, as I may 

 now term it, the Eustachian cord, since the structure under con- 

 sideration ultimately gives rise to the greater part of the tube of 

 that name) has the same general appearance as before. It, how- 

 ever, does not extend so far out from the processus muscularis as 

 before, a condition probably produced by the increase in size of 

 the process. A slight reduction has also taken part in this portion 

 of the cord (" diverticulum "). More marked, however, has been 

 the change in the middle portion of the cord. After extending 

 inward to the processus muscularis the cord rapidlv degeuerates, 

 becoming greatly fialtened and much reduced in size", so that for a 

 part of its course it is very difficult to recognize, the presence of 

 scattered nuclei and numerous pigment granules alone serving to 

 mark its existence. This great reduction has been associated with 

 a continuation of the proces.ses described in the last stage, i.e., the 

 growth of the hyoideau muscles (depressor mandibulie and depres- 

 sor ossis hyoidei), the articulation of the hyoid with the quadrate 

 and the increase in size of the mandibular artery (PI. VII, fio- 8 

 and PI. IX, fig. 25, En.). ' ''' 



The cord retains the degenerate condition just described until it 

 reaches a point just back of the region where the mandibular aorta 

 turns inward to join the carotid. A good idea of the condition of 

 the cord can be obtained from coronal sections (fig. 8). In such 

 it appears as a faint, narrow cord (En.), coursing in an antero- 

 posterior direction iu contact with the outer surface of the pro- 

 cessus muscularis. This cord contains no lumen and shows no 

 indication of a tubal character. It contains throughout its course 

 scattered nuclei arranged end to end, and it is largely colored by 

 numerous black pigment-granules. The yolk-spherules have now 

 disappeared entirely. There is very little substance to the cord 

 and in places where nuclei and pigment are lacking it becomes 

 very difficult to trace. 



Immediately posterior to i.he inflexed mandibular aorta the 

 Eustachian cord is joined to the pharyngeal wall by a narrow 

 strand of somewhat elongated cells. These cells are not easily 

 distinguishable from the cells of the surrounding connective tissue, 

 but they form a rather dense patch in the latter stretched between 




246 PEOCKEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Marcb, 



the pliarjDgeal wall and "^tlie tubal Anlage. Immediately beyond 

 this region this connecting portion broadens out considerably to form 

 a rather shallow bulging of cells from the roof of a " lateral 

 recess" (fig. 25, l.r.) or pouch of the pharynx, from the outer 

 extremity of which the thymus gland is given off. This " lateral 

 recess " is really formed by an extension outward of the branchial 

 portion of the pharynx over the internal branchial openings, so 

 that the latter are now situated ou the floor of the cavity. In the 

 preceding stage this " lateral recess " was just beginning to form 

 as a slight bulging beneath the proximal portion of the tubal 

 Anlage. AYith the extension externally of the " lateral recess" 

 the proximal portion of the Eustachian cord comes to appear as 

 an inconspicuous protuberance over the inner part of the roof of 

 the " recess" (fig. 25, immediately internal to v'li h). 



Stage VI. — Tadpole of 18 mm. Posterior limbs appearing as 

 minute buds below the root of the tail (PI. IX, fig. 26). 



In this stage the Eustachian cord has about reached the height 

 of its degeneration. The cord still maintains the same general 

 relations to the surrounding parts as before. Its distal, expanded 

 extremity remains distinct, and from thence the cord can readily 

 be traced to its characteristic position next to the outer surface of 

 the processus muscularis. Here, however, it soon becomes very 

 small and iheu can be traced only with the greatest difficulty. 

 The cord lies immediately above the mandibular aorta, and by 

 following the latter it may be traced as a minute, more or less 

 flattened pigmeuteil patch, which in certain parts contains one or 

 two nuclei not readily distinguishable from the nuclei of the sur- 

 rounding fibrous tissue (fig. 2G, Eu.). Immedialely posterior to 

 the quadrato-hyoid articulation the cord again enlarges slightly 

 and can be traced thence for a considerable distance. Then iu the 

 region where the ramus hyoraandibularis begins to come into close 

 relations with its external surface ail distinct traces of the cord are 

 lost. Nothing more of the cord is to bo made out until we come 

 to the region where the mandibular artery turns inward, where 

 for a short space the cord is again revealed and then terminates 

 without forming any clear connection with the pharyngeal wall. 

 This most posterior fragment of the cord is situated below the 

 quadrate, dorsal to the upper anterior end of the " lateral recess " 

 of the pharynx. There is no distinct proliferation from the dorso- 



I 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 247 



internal wall of this portion to indicate the proximal, connecting 

 part of the tubal cord. The proliferation has very likely opened 

 out with the formation of the ' ' lateral recess, ' ' and has been merged 

 into the dorsal wall of the latter. 



It thus appears that in the present stage the Eustachian cord for 

 the greater part of its length has undergone remarkable fragmen- 

 tation, having broken up into a number of sections of variable 

 length. Each of these fragments, however, retains exactly the 

 same relations to the surrounding structures that the corresponding 

 part of the cord showed in the preceding stage. It is quite possible 

 that the various fragments may still be connected by the trans- 

 parent cell-walls of the cord, and in that case the apparent frag- 

 mentation is simply due to the restriction of the more vital, stain- 

 able portions to areas less subject to the action of unfavorable 

 forces. I am somewhat inclined to consider this the actual condi- 

 tion in the present stage, since in a longitudinal series I have been 

 enabled to follow out with great care a pale, almost transparent 

 cord connecting some of the fragments. Posteriorly this cord 

 approaches very closely the wall of the pharynx. I have not been 

 able to make out any distinct connection between the two, but 

 their proximity would incline me to believe such a union to exist. 

 Still I have not been able to satisfy myself on this point. 



I have not been able to determine to my satisfaction the factors 

 which have been concerned in the degeneration of the Eustachian 

 cord. One of them is probably to be found in the pressure exerted 

 by the surrounding structures, particularly by the two muscles 

 already mentioned. Owing probably to its unfavorable position 

 the tubal cord appears to have little, if any, power of indepen- 

 dent growth. It therefore may have been acted on by the growth 

 anteriorly of the head whereby a pull has been exerted on it, 

 causing its wall to extend and its contents to be restricted to more 

 or less limited regions of the cord. 



Stage VII. — Tadpole of 21 mm. Hind limba well developed. 



This stage very closely resembles the preceding. Owing to an 

 accident the more anterior sections of the Eustachian cord in the 

 specimen examined are lacking, but I have no doubt but that this 

 portion of the cord in the present stage corresponds in all essential 

 respects with that in the preceding, since in the succeeding stage 

 the anterior portion is very similar to that in stage VI. So far 




248 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [MiiVcll, 



as the remaiuing parts are concerned, they present the same frag- 

 mentary character as in the preceding stage, being in certain loca- 

 tions almost unrecognizable. I noticed in the present series (and 

 likewise in several later ones) that there is no necessary corre- 

 spondence either in the number, length or distribution of the frag- 

 ments of the two sides. In the case of the specimen of the present 

 stage examined the sections were almost exactly transverse, so that 

 the same parts were cut on both sides. Yet the tubal cord may 

 be present for a considerable distance on one side and apparently 

 altogether absent on the other. This irregularity is a marked 

 feature during the entire metamorphic pei'iod. I find that there 

 is also marked individual variation in this respect. This vari- 

 ability would seem to indicate that the character of the fragmen- 

 tation is not due to some inherited tendency, but is produced by 

 mechanical forces exerted by the surrounding structures. 



Posteriorly the Eustachian cord terminates suddenly in the usual 

 position, dorsal to the anterior extremitj' of the "lateral recess" 

 of the branchial portion of the pharynx. In the same region a 

 prominent proliferation arises from the dorsal wall'of the " recess," 

 and extends upward to the same relative position as that occupied 

 by the cord in the more anterior sections. This structure may 

 represent the same mass of cells which originally established the 

 connection between the tubal cord and the wall of the pharynx, but 

 of this interpretation I am uncertain, since I was unable to discover 

 any sign of such proliferation in the preceding stage or in a num- 

 ber of later stages. Possibly its occurrence or absence is a matter 

 of individual variation. 



There has been but little change in the skeleton since the last 

 period. Posteriorly, however, the quadrate has developed a pos- 

 teriorly projecting processus oticus, which comes in contact with 

 the ventral surface of the auditory capsule. The processus oticus 

 arises at the augle formed by the body of the quadrate with the 

 processus ascendens. The stapes appears for the first time as an 

 oval chondrification within the membrane closing the fenestra 

 ovalis. There are no distinct traces of a columella auris. 



Stage VIII. — Tadpole of 21 mm. Preceding the appearance of 

 the fore-limbs. 



At this time we have the earliest distinct .appearance of tiic annu- 

 lar cartilage (PI. IX, fig. 28, An.'). About opposite the point where 




1901.] NATURAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 249 



the pterygo-palatine bar (processus quadrato-cranialis anterior) 

 joins the quadrate, a very conspicuous proliferation from the peri- 

 chondrium of the latter occurs. This proliferation forms a dense 

 strand of cells, which reach outward in the subcutaneous tissue 

 and aggregate themselves in a somewhat concentric fashion about 

 the distal, expanded termination of the Eustachian cord {Tijm.). 

 The dense patch there formed is the Anlage of the futui-e annu- 

 lar cartilage. From this region the Eustachian cord pursues the 

 same course that characterized the preceding stages. The cord 

 is, however, much more distinct than in any of the latter, and its 

 tubular character is plainly indicated by its nuclei, which are now 

 grouped about the periphery of the cord, thus giving the latter the 

 appearance of a duct with an obliterated lumen (PI. XI, fig. 29, 

 JEu.). In certain parts of the cord slight indications of a central 

 lumen can be made out, but, as a rule, any cavities that do appear 

 are neither very extensive nor pronounced. The cord, however, as 

 in the preceding stages, l)ecomes smaller as it extends posteriorly 

 and in the region of the quadrato-hyoid articulation disappears. It 

 soon reappears, however. Posterior to the hyoid articulation the 

 cord again becomes much reduced, but does not lose its continuity 

 with the most posterior portion. In the most posterior part of its 

 course the cord again enlarges, becomes clearly tubular, and ex- 

 hibits a more or less well-defined lumen. In .this portion the cord 

 occupies its characteristic position, ventral to the quadrate cartilage 

 and internal to the ramus hyomandibularis, which in the region of 

 the quadrato-hyoid articulation ascends from the ventral portion of 

 the hyoid arch to come into close relation with the outer wall of 

 the cord. From the dorsal wall of the " lateral recess " of the 

 pharynx a conspicuous strand of cells arises, the dorsal end of 

 which closely approaches the Eustachian cord, but before actual 

 contact takes place the cord rather suddenly terminates. I am 

 not certain of the significance of this strand. It may be the part 

 which originally connected the cord with the pharynx, but of this 

 I am uncertain, since I found no evidence of it in stage VI. 



Stage IX. — Tadpole of 18 mm. Both fore and hind limbs 

 present. 



This stage marjcs the commencement of the metamorphosis. 

 Since the changes which the Eustachian cord (or tube) undergoes 

 during this per'.od are oliviouslj' correlated with modifications 




250 FEOCEEDl>'GS OF TUE ACADEMY OF [March, 



taking place simultaneously in the skeletal structures, it is neces- 

 sary, in order to follow tlie former, to obtain a right eoneeptioa of 

 the latter. Hence in the present stage I will first treat of the 

 essential skeletal parts. lu the first place, the axis of the quad- 

 rate extends in a more dorso-veutral direction than formerly, so 

 that now the mandibular articulation lies below the anterior edge 

 of the eye, instead of being entirely in front of it as before. This 

 position implies that the lower part of the quadrate has moved or 

 rotated backward through a slight angle. The processus quadrato- 

 crauialis anterior (plerygo-palatine) is now considerably elongated 

 in an antero-posterior direction, a change obviously associated with 

 the backward rotation of the quadrate. The processus muscularis 

 (orbital) begins to show sigas of degeneration, especially along its 

 dorso-exterual edge. The hyoid still articulates to the ventral sur- 

 face of the quadrate. Posteriorly the processus ascendens has 

 degenerated and consequently the quadrate has lost its connection 

 with the wall of the brain-case, but instead it now joins by means 

 of its processus oticus the wall of the auditory capsule anterior to 

 the fenestra ovalis. In the membrane closing the latter the stapes 

 now appears as a large, oval mass of fully differentiated cartilage. 

 The columella auris is a delicate rod of primitive cartilage, closely 

 applied to the wall of the capsule. Anteriorly it terminates with- 

 out forming any connection whatever with either the quadrate or 

 any portion of the Eustachian tube and posteriorly it unites with 

 the stapes. The columella is most distinct and its tissue most 

 compact in its posterior portion, so that it cannot be regarded aa 

 a derivative of the quadrate. 



As a consequence of the posterior rotation of the distal, portion 

 of the quadrate, the distal extremity of the Eustachian cord is 

 now situated somewhat posterior to its former position, but its 

 relation to the immediately surrounding structures is the same as 

 before, since these likewise have been atiected by the quadrate's 

 change of axis. The annular cartilage, now a dense cellular mass, 

 is situated under the anterior margin of the eye and above the 

 mandibular articulation. To its ventral sui face the more anterior 

 fibres of the depressor ossis hyoidei have acquired attachment. 

 Imbedded in the cartilage is the distal end of the Eustachian cord, 

 the future tympanic cavity. The general appearance of the cord 

 is similar to that in the preceding stage. The cord still shows 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 251 



fraginentntion, all hough the length aud distribution of the frag- 

 ments differ on the two sides. No connection between the cord 

 and the pharynx can be determined with certainty, although the 

 proHferatiou attached to the dorsal wall of the "lateral recess" 

 is still present. 



Stage X. — Tailed toad of 15.5 mm. Fore and hind limbs well 

 developed. 



This stage very closely resembles the preceding, the most marked 

 differences being the greater antero-posterior elongation of the 

 processus quadrato-cranialis anterior and the associated greater 

 posterior rotation of the quadrate. ' The Eustachian cord, also, 

 is very distinct, particularly in its anterior and posterior portions. 

 In the region just back of the quadrato-hyoid articulation it is 

 greatly reduced and traceable only with difficulty. In several 

 places the cord shows a distinct lumen. There are no distinct 

 signs of a proliferation attached to the pharyngeal wall extending 

 toward the cord. 



6W/e AT.— Tailed toad, 6.8 mm., tail 1.5 mm. Close of the 

 metamorphosis. 



The processus quadrato-cranialis anterior has now increased con- 

 siderably in length, so that it extends in a direct antero-posterior 

 direction as in the adult toad. The axis of the quadrate has 

 attained an almost vertical direction, but it still extends somewhat 

 forward, its distal, articular end Iteiug located under the middle or 

 posterior part of the eye. The hyoid still maintains its union with 

 the quadrate. More posteriorly, in the region of the auditory cap- 

 sule, the columella auris can be traced farther forward. At its 

 anterior, distal extremity it is prolonged forward as a dense strand 

 of cells, which forms a connection with the posterior surface of 

 the quadrate. Only the more posterior portion of the columellar 

 rod is formed of true cartilage, the anterior portion being as yet 

 only a dense, undifferentiated mass of cells. 



The most conspicuous changes which the tympano-Eustachian 

 tube has undergone since the preceding period have been asso- 

 ciated with the change of axis of the suspensory cartilages. As a 

 result of this the tympanic portion of the tube, together with the 

 annular cartilage, has moved backward to a region below the 

 posterior portion of the eye. The tube, as a whole, exhibits the 

 same fragmentary character as hitherto, and I have remarked here. 




252 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



as in a number of other stage?, a difference in the condition of the 

 tubes of the two sides. Posteriorly the tube terminates witiiout 

 forming any connection with the pharynx. The proliferation 

 from the pharynx is not very distinct. It probably tends to dis- 

 appear in connection with the degeneration of the branchial appar- 

 atus. 



Stage XII. — Tailed toad, 7 mm. Close of metamorphosis. 



The quadrate cartilage now stands almost vertical, its distal, 

 articular extremity lying under the posterior border of the eye. 

 The hyoid bar has separated completely from the quadrate and its 

 dorsal extremity is now joined by the intervention of a dense 

 strand of cells to the base of the auditory capsule. 



The distal part of the tyrapauo-Eustachian tube now lies imme- 

 diately posterior and ventral to the eye. Since the distal portion 

 of the quadrate rotates backward more rapidly than the remaining 

 part, it results that the posterior, hitherto ventral, surface of the 

 cartilage forms a shallow concavitv. From this behavior it follows 

 that the distal, expanded portion of the tube — i.e., tympanic por- 

 tion — comes to lie farther posterior in relation to the rest of the 

 cord, so that the latter no longer presents an almost direct antero- 

 posterior course, but instead now lies in an almost transverse plane, 

 except for a slight anterior inclination. The tympanic region of 

 the tube is thus brought into relation with the auditory capsule. 

 In the present period it has not quite reached the region of the 

 latter, but is not far removed, being located just back of the eye. 

 Another feature shown by the present stage is the union of the 

 various fragments of wliich it was hitherto composed. This union 

 is also probably to -be connected with the quadrate's change of 

 axis, since this would result in carrying the more anterior frag- 

 ments biickward and thus bringing them into closer relation with 

 the posterior parts. At present the tube can be traced without a 

 break throughout its entire course. This fact speaks strongly for 

 the view that these parts have all along been united by an attenu- 

 ated cord. The fragments are simply the contents of this cord 

 which have lieen restricted to certain areas. As a result of the 

 backward rotation of the quadrate, the stretching to which the cord 

 had hitherto been subjected is relieved and accordingly the vari- 

 ous fragments of the substance flow together, thus producing the 

 union described. Proximallv, however, the tube forms no con- 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 253 



nection with the pharyngeal wall, but immediately internal to its 

 proximal termination the pharynx sends out a narrow cleft between 

 the hyoid and the base of the auditory capsule. Posteriorly the 

 tube ceases immediately in front of the dense strand connecting 

 the hyoid coruua with the auditory capsule, so that at this stage the 

 tube occupies its definitive position between the quadrate and hyoid 

 cartilages. As a result of the changes that have taken place in 

 the hyoid its nerve, the ramus hyomaudiliularis, now lies ventral 

 and posterior to the tube — a pos^itiou which characterizes it in the 

 adult condition. In the branchial region the entire branchial 

 apparatus, including the " lateral recess" of the pharynx, has be- 

 come largely obliterated. 



Stage XIII. — Young toad, 6 mm. Metamorphosis complete. 



This period marks the close of the metamorphosis. The infe- 

 rior, articular portion of the quadrate extends more posterior, so 

 that the quadrate on its posterior surface shows a marked con- 

 cavity. The general course of the quadrate is about as follows: 

 Dorsally from its union with the base of the auditory capsule it 

 extends forward and downward for some little distance, it then 

 describes a wide curve downward and backward for the remainder 

 of its length, so that its distal end, bearing the mandibular car- 

 tilage, now comes to lie under or even slightly behind its dorsal, 

 proximal extremity. Tne hyoid arch is now fused completely with 

 the auditory capsule, the intervening cellular strand having become 

 cartilaginous. 



The annular cartilage is now located posterior to the eye and 

 ventral to the anterior portion of the auditory capsule. It closely 

 underlies the skin and is external to the outer surface of the 

 quadrate. The Eustachian tube itself differs but little from its 

 condition in the preceding stage, except that its lumen, where 

 present, is more distinct and extensive. A short distance above 

 the tube the distal extremity of the columella auris may be observed 

 as a dense cellular mass, which posteriorly grades into true car- 

 tilage. 



Stage XIV. — Young toad, about 9 mm (figs. SO, 31). 



In this stage the tympano-Eustachian passage has the same 

 general position and relations that distinguish it in the fully mature 

 animal. Relatively it is not so large as in the latter, nor is its 

 lumen complete throughout, but in all other respects it is essentiallv 




254 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [^larcll, 



like the adult structure. Figs. 30 and 31 illustrate the condition 

 of the tube at this time. In fig. .30 we have a transverse si!ction 

 through one side of the head immediately back of the eye. To the 

 outer side is shown the quadrate cartilage, which in the present 

 stage stands almost vertical and hence is shown in the figure cut 

 throughout the greater part of its length. External to the upper 

 portion of the cartilage is the tympanic portion of the Eustachian 

 tube, showing a slight lumen (Tijm.^. I have another specimen of 

 approximately the same age in which the lumen is much larger, 

 forming a considerable cavity. Underlying this portion is the 

 tympanic or annular cartilage, which in its ventral portion, at 

 least, is completely chondrified (.4>i. ). The fully formed car- 

 tilage does not, however, form a complete ring. Internally the 

 tube approaches the outer surface of the quadrate, as was the case 

 in the earlier stages. Applied to the dorso-external wall of the 

 tympanic cavity is the distal extremity of the columella auris, at 

 present a very compact cellular mass, not yet differeutiated into 

 true cartilage (CL). The apparent inclusion of the columella 

 within the tympanic cavity is produced by the subsequent growth 

 of the latler around this portion of the cartilage. Attached to 

 the ventral surface of the annular cartilage are fibi-es of the 

 depressor ossis ^hyoidei (m.d.h.). The attachment of the muscle 

 to the cartilage was acquired soon after the earliest Anlage of the 

 latter had appeared. At its ventral end the muscle has lost its 

 attachment to the hyoid cartilage and has acquired a new insertion 

 into the angle of the mandible, so that like the depressor mau- 

 dibulaa it serves to depress the latter (compare also fig. 31). The 

 bulk of the muscle lies posterior to the Eustachian tube. Internal 

 to the muscle and between it and the quadrate are two blood- 

 vessels, which correspond to the original niandil)ular aorta (»i.a.). 

 This vessel, as we have seen, was an important one during the 

 tadpole period, but during the metamorphosis it underwent some 

 j)rofound changes. Its middle portion largely degenerated, so 

 th.at the vessel became divided into a proximal and a distal half. 

 The vessel undergoes other changes, but these I have not been able 

 to follow satisfactorily with the material at hand. 



Fig. 31 shows a section through the tympauo-Eustachian tube 

 near its posterior boundary. The quadrate {q.) is here seen in 

 two separate portions, a dorsal and a ventral. This condition can 




1901.] XATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 25-5 



be readily understood by referring to the descriptiou of the car- 

 tilage as given in stage XIII. It suffices to mention that the 

 section passes back of the point where the quadrate curves back- 

 ward on itself, so that the dorsal is the proximal, the ventral the 

 distal portion of the cartilage. The distal portion bears the man- 

 dii)le. Underlying the proximal portion is the Eustachian tube 

 (Eu.), here slioun in three detached segments. Other sections, 

 however, show these segments continuous, so that the tube is now 

 complete. Moreover, the proximal innermost segment is continu- 

 ous with the pharynx and in reality represents a diverticulum 

 (div. ) from the lattei'. In the other specimen that I have of this 

 stage this portion is continuous with the pharynx, but its distal 

 extremity ends blindly without forming a connection with the 

 Eustachian tube. In the toad of stage XIII this diverticulum of 

 the pharynx was also present, and connecting it with the widely 

 separated tubal Anlage was a dense strand of connective tissue 

 cells, whose long diameters were extended in a direction coinciding 

 with a line drawn between the separated parts. By means of this 

 diverticulum the tympano-Eustachian tube is now united to the 

 pharynx. The tube presents throughout an irregular lumen, bounded 

 by a well-defined columnar epithelium. That portion of the tube 

 which is most externally situated is the posterior part of the 

 tympanic cavity {Ti/m.). Attached to the dorsal wall of the 

 latter is the columella auris (CL). The ramus hyomandibularis 

 of the facial nerve is not shown in this section, since, owing to 

 the posterior flexure of the quadrate and the separation of the 

 hyoid from the latter, the nerve now lies entirely posterior to the 

 tube. 



SUMMARY. 



The results recorded in the preceding pages may be briefly sum- 

 marized as follows : 



1. The tympano-Eustachian passage is in the main derived from 

 the dorsalmost portion of the hyomandibular fold (cleft). 



2. In the earliest stages described, the hyomandibular fold is 

 present as a solid, plate-like fold extending outward and forward 

 beneath the eye region and terminating laterally in a free edge 

 situated a short distance below the ectoderm. Its attachment to 

 the ectoderm is lost at about this stage. 




256 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



3. At first the outer or distal edge of the hyomandibular fold 

 is smooth and unbroken throughout its entire extent. Later, this 

 edge becomes interrupted in its middle portion by the formation of 

 a progressively deepening depression, which ultimately reaches the 

 pharyngeal wall and divides the hyomandibular fold into two 

 parts — a dorsal cord-like portion, the future tympano-Eustachian 

 passage, and a ventral portion forming a shallow sacculation to 

 the ventro-lateral portion of the phai-yngeal cavity. 



4. The ventral portion of the hyomandibular fold ceases to be 

 recognizable after the late tadpole stages. It is this portion which 

 ViUy considers as the last remnant of the hyomandibular fold. 



5. The earliest evidence of the degeneration of the hyoman- 

 dibular fold is aSorded by the recession of its outer edge from the 

 neighborhood of the external ectoderm. Only the dorsalmost 

 portion of the fold continues in intimate proximity to the skin. 

 The withdrawal of the remainder is associated with (1) the reduc- 

 tion in size of the pharynx, in consequence of the segregation of 

 the surrounding mesenchyme to form the AnUu/en of muscles and 

 cartilages, and (2) the development of the muscles of the hyoid 

 arch — the depressor mandibulre and ossis hyoidei. Of these mus- 

 cles the depressor mandibuke extends forward between the skin 

 and the outer border of the hyomandibular fold and acquires 

 attachment to the developing quadrate cartilage in front of the 

 fold. It thus interposes an effective barrier to further outward 

 extension of the fold. Only the dorsalmost portion of tiie fold 

 remains unimpeded by the muscle, and this accordingly retains its 

 proximity to the ectoderm and in the subsequent growth of the 

 head is carried outward as a narrow, cord-like strand expanded at 

 its outer extremity into a club-shaped swelling. This portion I 

 have designated the " diverticulum." It is the Anlaye of the 

 tympano-Eustachian passage. 



6. The outer hyoidean muscle, the depressor ossis hyoidei, also 

 acquires attachment to the quadrate Anluge at a point above and 

 posterior to the hyomandibular cleft. The "diverticulum" or 

 Anlage of the tympano-Eustachian passage thus comes to he 

 between the two hyoidean muscles. 



7. The growth anteriorly of the hyoidean muscles produces a 

 marked antero-posterior extension of the hyomandibidar fold and 

 of its derivative, the tympano-Eustachian Anlage. This antero- 




1901.] NATDRAL SCI£^'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 257 



posterior directiou takeu by tlie tubal Anlage is characteristic of it 

 during the entire larval period. 



8. The farther degeneration of the hyomaudibular fold is corre- 

 lated with the subsequent increa5e in size of the muscles already 

 mentioned, the union of the hyoid cartilage with the quadrate and 

 the enlargement of the mandibular aortic arch. 



9. After the degeneration of the hyomaudibular fold the 

 Anlage of the tympano- Eustachian passage persists as a minute, 

 solid cord, extending along the outer surface of the processus 

 muscularis of the quadrate. Posteriorly it is attached to the wall 

 of the pharynx at a point posterior to the quadrato-hyoid articu- 

 lation. Anteriorly and distally it expands to form the club-shaped 

 Anlage of the tympanic cavity. 



10. During the active tadpole period the tympano-Eustachian 

 Anlage undergoes marked degeneration. This degeneration is 

 confined to the middle and posterior parts of the Anlage, the 

 distal expanded portion retaining its original relative size through- 

 out the entire larval period. The degeneration is in aU probability 

 connected with the growth of the two muscles — depressor man- 

 dibulpe and ossis hyoidei — between which it lies. Owing to the 

 lack of space it is unable to keep pace with the surrounding struc- 

 tures in the subsequent growth of the animal. 



11. In the early tadpole period the tympano-Eustachian Ajilage 

 is continuous posterioily with the wall of the pharynx. Later the 

 connection between the two apparently disappears, though the time 

 of its disappearance seems to vary in different individuals. An 

 indistinct strand may continue to unite the two parts, but this 

 I have been unable to demonstrate. 



12. The degeneration of the tympano-Eustachian Anlage is 

 carried to an extreme in the later tadpole stages. At this time it 

 is apparently broken up into a number of fragments of varying 

 length. This fragmentation is probably more appareuc than real, 

 being produced by the restriction of the more vital staiuable sub- 

 stance of the tubal Anlage to areas less subject to the pressure of 

 the neighboring structures. The irregular distribution of tha 

 fragments, both in different individuals and on different sides of 

 the same individual, favors the view that a compressed, transparent 

 cord still connects the apparently separate parts. In one specimen 



17 




258 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMr OF [Marcll, 



(tadpole of about 18 mm.) I have been enabled to trace out such 

 a connecting cord. 



13. Regeneration of the tympano-Eustachian Anlage begins at 

 a period immediately precedins: the period when the fore-limbs 

 break out of the opercular cavity. 



14. The later metamorphosis of the tubal Anlage is connected 

 with the modifications of the neighboring skeletal structures, par- 

 ticularly with the posterior rotation of the quadrate. By this 

 means the tubal cord comes into relation with the auditory region 

 of the skull and the various fragments are brought closer together, 

 80 that they can readily unite. 



15. The acquisition of a lumen by the tubal Anlage takes place 

 gradually, beginning at the close of the metamorphosis. Details 

 apparently vary in different individuals. 



16. Completion of the tympano-Eustachian passage is effected 

 by an outgrowth from the pharynx which unites with the tubal 



Anlage. 



17. The final position of the tympano-Eustnchian tube between 

 the mandibular and hyoid bars is produced by the separation of 

 the latter from the quadrate and its attachment to the auditory 

 capsule posterior to the tube. 



18. The annular cartilage arises at a stage immediately pre- 

 ceding the protrusion of the fore-limbs. Its Anlage forms a dense 

 cellular strand derived from the perichondrium of the quadrate 

 and surrounding the tympanic portion of the tub;il xhdage. It 

 does not begin to form fully differentiated cartilage until after the 

 close of the metamorphosis. 



19. The stapes arises within the membrane closing the fenestra 

 ovalis. It has no connection with any of the visceral -arches. 



20. The columella auris is first met witli in the early stages of 

 the metamorphosis, as a compact cellular strand extending forward 

 from the stapes and terminating imperceptibly in the connective 

 tissue. It continues to grow forward and acquires connection with 

 the quadrate. Continued growth brings it in contact with the 

 tympanic cavity. Chondrificaliou begins in the posterior portion 

 of the rod.

TUETHEE STUDIES ON THE CHEOMOSOMES OF THE HEMIPTEEA 

 HETEEOPTEEA. 



BY THOMAS H. MONTGOMERY, JR., PH.D. 



The preseut account deals with tlie relations of the chromosomes 

 in the spermatogenesis of certain Hemlpkm, and is practically a 

 contmuation of a previous paper of mine.' In the present paper 

 will be found a description of the chromosomal relations, as far as 

 they could be determined, in certain species not heretofore ex- 

 amined. 



The material was collected last summer at Woods Holl, Mass., 

 irnd was kindly identified for me by Dr. Philip K. Uhler, of Bal- 

 timore. The testes of some of the species (Tingis davata, Corixa 

 verticalis, Cymns hiridus, Lygus lyratemh) were fixed simply in 

 Conklin's picro-acetic mixture, and this fixation not allowing suc- 

 cessful staining with Hermann's saflranine-gentian violet m^ethod 

 the relations of the nucleoli and of the chromatin nucleoli could 

 not be determined. But in the remaining species {NabU annulatws, 

 Conzus altemalm and Rarmostes reflexulm) the testes were fixed 

 in Hermann's platinic chloride-osmic-acetic mixture which allowed 

 the saffranine-violet stain, so that for these species the distinction 

 of nucleoli and chromatin nucleoli could be made. 



As in my preceding paper {I. c.) on this subject, the term 

 " chromatin nucleolus " is applied to that peculiar nuclear ele- 

 ment which is a chromosome peculiarly modified in preserving its 

 form and dense structure, which chromosomes as a rule show^only 

 in the height of mitosis, throughout every stage of the sperma'- 

 togenetic cycle. With the saffranine-violet method, the chromo- 

 somes proper stain red only in mitosis, and violet in other stages, 

 but the chromatin nucleolus maintains the red stain in all sta<'es.'

Three testes were studied, none of them showing spermatogonic 

 monaster stages.

262 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mafcll, 



Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation mitosis 

 (PI. X, fig. 1) show seven chromatin elements of relatively equal 

 volume, and lateral views of the chromosomes in this stage show 

 that they are all dumbbell-shaped, and hence probably bivalent 

 (fig. 2). This mitos^is results in a transverse (reduction) division of 

 all these elements. Very frequently one of them is seen to be 

 characterized in having its two components of very unequal 

 volume. 



Since these preparations were stained merely by (he iron-ha.'mo- 

 tosylin method, the presence of chromatin nucleoli could not be 

 positively determined owing to the lack of difftreutial staining. 

 But in the prophases of the first maturation mitosis can be seen a 

 large true nucleolus, and 1 wo smaller rounded bodies (generally of 

 different volumes) which are sometimes in mutual apposition, and 

 sometimes not. If the latter are chromatin nucleoli, they are much 

 smaller than any of the seven bivalent chromatin elements of the 

 maturation division, so that the latter are possibly all unmodified 

 chromosomes. 



This species of the Tingitidcv, in having such a small number of 

 chromosomes, may be regarded rather as a specialized than a primi- 

 tive form. 

 2. Corixa vertioalis Fieber. 



The chromosomes could not be counled in the monaster stages of 

 the spermatogonia. Two testes were examined. 



Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation mitosis 

 (PI. X, fig. 3, in which two of the chromosomes are seen laterallj') 

 show twelve chromatin elements, of which one regularly is placed 

 in the centre of a circle composed of the remaining eleven. Lateral 

 views (fig. 4, in which four of the large and two of the small 

 elements are shown) show that all these elements are dumbbell- 

 shaped, and hence probably bivalent. Three are much smaller 

 than the remaining nine, and the very smallest is the one that 

 occupies the centre of the chromosomal plute. All these elements 

 divide by a transverse (reduction) division, and in the daughter 

 cells (second spermatocytes) the chromosomes are arranged all close 

 together in the equatorial plane; it is the case in a number of 

 species of the Hemiptem that the chromosomes show difiereut plans 

 of arrangement in the two maturation mitoses. 



In the post-synapsis stage there is found in the nucleus a peri- 




1901.] XATCEAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 263 



pheral, compact, densely staining body of dumbbell form (Pi. X, 

 fig. 5, the chromatin reticulum not shown in this figure). This 

 possibly represents a true nucleolus and a chromatin nucleolus in ap- 

 position, but this point could not be determined. Similarly I 

 could not ascertain whether the three small chromatin elements of 

 the maturation mitosss are chromatin nucleoli. 



3. Cymus luridus Stal. 



There were no spermatogouic mitoses in the two teste? examined 

 of this Lygseid. 



Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation mitosis 

 show fifteen chromatin elements of very varying volumes (fig. 6), 

 though one (N. 3 f) is always much smaller than the others and, 

 by analogy with many other Hemiptera, probably represents a 

 chromatin nucleolus. Lateral views of the same stage show that 

 all these elements are dumbbell-shajjed, and so jirobably bivalent 

 (fig. 7 showing the smallest and four of the larger elements). All 

 these elements become transversely divided. 



In the growth period of the spermatocytes, preceding the 

 raalnration divisions, the nucleus contains a large true nucleolus, 

 very irregular in form and peripheral in position. There are also 

 found as many as four smaller, rounded bodies, two of which are 

 frequently mutually apposed; if these be chromatin nucleoli there 

 would be potentially two bivalent chromatin nucleoli in the resting 

 spermatocyte (four univalent ones), though apparently only a 

 single bivalent one in the maturation mitosis. 



This species has a larger number of chromatin elements in the 

 first maturation mitosis than does the closely si/nilar C. angnstatus, 

 which I have shown to possess only thirteen. 



4. Lygus pratensis Linn. 



The individuals of this species of Capsid were labeled by Dr. 

 Uhler, " Lygus 2)rateim-s \ar.;" whether Dr. Uhler regarded them 

 as simply showing slight difierences in color, or as a good geo- 

 graphical variety, I cannot say. In the two testes studied there 

 were no spermatogouic monasters. 



In the monaster stage of the first maturation division are found 

 eighteen chromatin elements (PI. X, figs. 8, 9), namely, sixteen 

 larger and two {N. 2) much smaller; while in the monaster of the 

 second maturation mitosis (fig. 10) are present seventeen elements, 




264 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



sixteen larger and one smaller (K. 2). The sixteen larger ele- 

 ments ill the first mitosis are all bivalent, and probably are all true 

 chromosomes; they all divide transversely. The two small ele- 

 ments (those marked iV. 2 in the figures) of this mitosis do not 

 divide, but one of them goes undivided into the <me daughter 

 cell (second spermatocyte), the other one into the other — this 

 explaining why in the first spermatocytes there are eighteen ele- 

 ments, in the second only seventeen. On account of these small 

 elements not dividing, each of them must be considered univa- 

 lent ; for so far as my observations on the Haniptera have gone, 

 all bivalent elements divide transversely in the first maturation 

 mitosis. 



The species of Caj^sidce thus far examined (compare the preced- 

 ing pajjer, /. c. ) show a remarkable agreement in the number of 

 their chromosomes. Thus, if we count each bivalent chromatin 

 element of the first maturation mitosis as two, there would be the 

 following number of univalent elements (counting in also chroma- 

 tin nucleoli) in this mitosis of the following species: Lygus praten- 

 sis, 34; Leptopterna dolobrata, 34; Calocoris rapidiis, 33; Pcecilo- 

 caputs lineatus, 35?; P. goniphorus, 34 or 36. There is not found 

 in tiie Capsidce such a disparity in the number of chromosomes as 

 is found between the species of some other families {e.g., the 

 Lygceidte and Coreidce), so that the Capsida would appear to be a 

 more homogeneous group. Then if the number of the cliromo- 

 somes may be loosely taken as a criterion of the degree of speciali- 

 zatiou, a smaller number of chromosomes marking a more special- 

 ized stage (and this I hold to be true within certain bounds), the 

 Capsidce, like the ReduviidcB and Phymatidce, may be considered 

 relatively primitive Hemipfera heteroptera, in comparison with the 

 Pentatomidte, Lijgceidce and Coreidce. This, it seems to me, is a 

 vital interest in the study of the chromosomes — to find criteria for 

 testing relationships. 

 6. Nabis annulatus Kent. 



I had only a single testis for examination, and it showed no 

 spermatogouic mitoses. 



There is no complete rest stage in the growth period of this 

 species (in which regard it is like certain of the Coreidce). In 

 the late telophase there is found in the nucleus (PI. X, fig. 11) a 

 large, usually centrally placed chromatin nucleolus (X. 2), with 




1901.] XATUKAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 265 



more or less uneven contours; and attached to it is a smaller true 

 nucleolus (N.) which disappears in the following prophase by gradual 

 <lecrease in volume. Someiimes there are two chromatin nucleoli, 

 generally of different volumes; since in such cases neither of these 

 has the volume of tlie single one, they probably represent separated 

 parts of the latter. 



In the proj)hases of the first maturation mitosis, which follow 

 immediately upon the stage just described, the chromatin nucleolus 

 shows itself to be composed of four dumbbell-shaped (hence bival- 

 ent) parts of unequal volumes, arranged close together (N. 2, fig. 

 13). Necessarily all four parts must have been present iu the 

 preceding stage, but have been optically inseparable ; the apparently 

 single chromatin nucleolus of the growth period is made up in 

 reality of four bivalent ones. There is great diversity in the mode 

 of mutual apposition of the latter in the prophases; sometimes the 

 long axes of all may be parallel, but more frequently they cross 

 one another at varying angles; no ease was seen where all four lie 

 in the same plane. Quite frequently there are only three chroma- 

 tin nucleoli in mutual contact near the centre of the nucleus, while 

 the fourth is separated from them and placed against the nuclear 

 membrane (fig. 12). All four are true chromatin nucleoli, main- 

 taining throughout the growth period their dense structure, eveu 

 contours, and red slain with the saffranine-violet method of Her- 

 mann, while the chromatin of the chromosomes proper stain 

 violet. In the prophase we are considering are found also six 

 bivalent chromosomes (portions of all of which are seen in fig. 13) ; 

 these are tetrads with very wide longitudinal splitting of the type 

 characteristic for Anma (Coreid). Toward the close of the 

 projihase these chromosomes shorten and Ijecome much more com- 

 pact structures. 



Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturatiou mitosis 

 (fig. 11) show in every case ten chromatin elements of compara- 

 tively large size. Four of these must correspond to the four 

 chromatin nucleoli, and six to the six chromosomes proper of the 

 preceding stages, since there has been no loss nor maltiplication 

 of any of these elements. Of the ten elemeuls of the stage of 

 fig. 14, one (j).) on pole view always appears round, on lateral 

 view (p., fig. 16) it shows a simple dumbbell shape; this one, 

 much smaller than any of the others, probably represents one crt 




266 PJiOCKEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



the chromatin uucleoli. The nine remaining elements are likewise 

 all dumbbell-shaped, but on pole view of the spindle (fig. 14) 

 each of them appears elongate, sometimes showing a si^lit in the 

 long axis. On lateral views of the spindle (figs. 15. 16) the)' 

 sometimes appear bipartite, sometimes quadripartite. As a study 

 of them in the preceding prophases demonstrates, each becomes 

 placed in the equatorial plane of the spindle so that the transverse 

 split (the line of junction of the two component univalent chro- 

 mosomes) lies in the equator of the spindle, and the longitudinal 

 split of each univalent cbromosorae Via perpendicular to this 

 plane. Thus the nine larger chromatin elements of fig. 14 appear 

 elongate on pole view of the S})indle, because each of these bivalent 

 chromosomes is composed of two univalent chromosomes with 

 their long axes parallel to one another and to the equatorial plane 

 of the spindle. Hence on pole view of this spindle wo see a plate 

 of (univalent) chromosomes, each seen longitudinally ; whereas 

 such a view in the other Hemiptera studied by me shows the 

 chromosomes seen from their ends, since in other Hemiptera it is 

 the general rule that two univalent chromosomes are joined end to 

 end, and not (as in Nabis) side to side. 



All ten elements divide transversely in this mitosis, so that whole 

 univalent elements become separated from one another. A pole 

 view of one of the plates of daughter chromosomes resulting from 

 this division (fig. 17) shows one smallest element (p.), the half 

 of the corresponding element of figs. 14 and 16, and nine larger 

 elements, the halves of those of fig. 14. In fig. 17 each of the 

 nine larger univalent elements shows a well-marked longitu<linal 

 split, whi(;h had been usually hidden in the preceding monaster 

 stage (fig. 14); it is a general rule in the Hemiptera that the longi- 

 tudinal split becomes temporarily hidden in the monaster stage of 

 the first maturation mitosis. 



One point needs to be emphasized: there are in the prophases 

 four chromatin nucleoli and six chromosomes, and in the monaster 

 stage of the first mitosis again ten elements, that is, obviously 

 the same as those in the prophases. But the four chromatin 

 nucleoli of the prophases (figs. 12, 13) are smaller than any of 

 the chromatin elements of the monaster stage (fig. 14), except 

 the small element in the latter marked p. Accordingly three at 

 least of the chromatin nucleoli must have increased in volume 




1901.]" NATURAL SCIENCES OF I'HIEADELPHIA. 267 



before the latter stage. This is remarkable, since in allj other 

 Hemiptera studied by me the chromatin nucleoli regularly^de- 

 crease somewhat in volume, generally to considerable degree, 

 before they fake their position in the equator of the spindle. 



In Coriscuf ferns Linn., the only other species of the NabidcB 

 studied, I found (preceding paper, Lc.) in the monaster stage of 

 the first maturation mitosis nine bivalent chromosomes and one bival- 

 ent chromatin nucleolus. In tlie growth period preceding there is 

 present in the nucleus one bivalent chromatin nucleolus ofjarge size 

 and a smaller one; but not a group of four bivalent chromatin nucle- 

 oli as in Nahis. If the chromatin nucleoli be regarded as disap" 

 pearing chromosomes, for which view I have given reasons, ther» 

 we may conclude that Nobis annulatus, by virtue of showing four 

 of the chromatin elements on the way to disappearance, has 

 advanced beyond the stage of Coriscus feriis. 



6. Corizus alternatus Spy. 



Five testes of this species were studied. 



Only two clear cases of spermatogonic monasters were found 

 where all the chromatin elements could be readily counted; each 

 of these showed fourteen elements. As PI. X, fig. 18 shows, two 

 of the elements are rounded and much smaller than the others 

 (iV. 2), and these are chromatin nucleoli. Of the twelve elongate 

 chromosomes proper, two (those marked A, fig. 18) are considerably 

 larger than the others; and one of these appears always to have 

 the form of a rod, while the other has a bent V-shape. All four- 

 teen elements are halved in the metakinesis. 



In the early portion of the growth period each spermatocytic 

 nucleus contains a clearly bipartite chromatin nucleolus, representing 

 a union of the two chromatin nucleoli derived from the sperma- 

 togonia; each of its univalent components appears occasionally 

 longitudinally split, which is unusual in the Hemiptera.^ In the 

 rest stage following (there is a complete rest stage in this .species) 

 the nucleus (fig. 19) contains a bivalent chromatin nucleolus (N. 

 2), which has increased in volume and generally is ovoid in out- 

 line; but sometimes during the whole growth period the two 



' Dr. F. C. Paulmier, who has worked out the spermatogenesis of Anasa 

 tristis De G., has tlemonstrated to me a longitudinal splitting of the chro- 

 matin nucleolus in the growth period of the Lygseid, Myodocha serripei 

 Oliv. 




268 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF piarrll, 



univalent chromatin nucleoli may remain entirely disconnected. 

 In this rest stage tlie nucleus contains also one or two larger, 

 irregularly shaped true nucleoli (fig, 19, N.) which are not 

 apposed to the chromatin nucleolus. 



Pole views of the monaster stage of the first maturation mitosis 

 (PL X, fig. 20) show seven chromatin elements; and lateral views 

 of such cases show that all seven are dumbbell-shaped, and hence 

 bivalent. The smallest of these elements is the chromatin nucle- 

 olus (N. 2, figs. 20, 21), and, as is generally the case in Hemij)- 

 iera, this divides in metakiuesis before the chromosomes do. Of 

 the six chromosomes proper, one is always much larger than the 

 others (figs. 20, 21), and this one evidently represents the union 

 of the two largest univalent chromosomes of the spermatogonia 

 (in fig. 21 is shown, besides the chromatin nucleolus, iV. 2, thi 

 largest chromosome and three of the five smaller cliromosomes) ; 

 and one chromosome is much smaller than the others, often little 

 larger than the chromatin nucleolus (this is the one lying nearest 

 to the largest chromosome in fig. 21). All these elements are 

 transversely divided in the metakinesis. Occasionally pole views 

 of the monaster stage of the first maturation mitosis show eight 

 chromatin elements instead of seven; this is due to one of the seven 

 bivalent elements having precociously divided into its univalent 

 components. In the second spermatocyte are regularly found 

 seven univalent elements. 



Corizus anmdatm in its spermatogenesis thus shows a very close 

 similarity to C. lateralis Say, previously described by me. 

 7. Harmostes reflexulus Say. 



The individuals collected at Woods TIoU were marked by Dr. 

 Uhler, " Harmostes rejlexuhi.-! f^ay, variety"; whether a geographi- 

 cal race was thereby intended I cannot say. 



Five testes were examined. The whole process of spermato- 

 genesis seems exactly similar to that described by me previously 

 for individuals of this si)ecies from I'cnnsylvauiii. 



This is one of the Hemiptera with an uneven normal number of 

 chromosomes, there being found in the spermatogonia thirteen 

 chromatin elements, namely, two smaller chromatin nucleoli (i\'. 2 

 of figs. 22 and 23) and eleven larger chromosomes proper. The 

 uneven normal number of chromosomes being a relatively rare phe- 

 nomenon, it having been observed so far only in four .species of 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 269 



Hemiptera (described in my previous paper. I. c. ), I have counted 

 in the testes of the "Woods Holl individuals the chromatin ele- 

 ments in all the cases of spermatogonic monasters which were 

 favorable for such counting, with the following results: Nine 

 spermatogonia showed exactly thirteen elements; in one case I 

 could not determine whether thirteen or fourteen were present. 

 These cases from four different testes, as well as those from four 

 testes of Pennsylvania individuals previously described by me, are 

 sufEcient to show that the uneven number is not au individual 

 variation, due e.g. to some pathological condition, but is probably 

 characteristic of every individual of the species. 



The unei'en normal number of chromosomes which I have 

 demonstrated also for Protenor belfragei, Alydus eurinus and 

 (Edancala dorsalis, represents a stage in the change of the number 

 of chromosomes from one even number to the next successive even 

 number. For Protenor I have shown that the uneven sperma- 

 togonic number is produced by a failure of two of the sperma- 

 togonic chromosomes to separate from one another. This I can now 

 prove for Harmostes also. For while in most of the monaster 

 stages, as in fig. 22, all eleven chromosomes appear more or less 

 simply rod-shaped, in a few ca,*es, as in fig. 23, oue of the eleven 

 shows a well-marked transverse constriction. Were this constric- 

 tion a complele division, there would be the even number twelve. 

 Hence, for Harmostes the ancestral number of chromosomes 

 must have been twelve, and if, as is the case in Protenor, the odd 

 bivalent chromosome is 'destined to change from a chromosome 

 into a chromatin nucleolus, in the course of time ten chromosomes 

 will be the number for the species. 



In conclusion, I would again call attention to the importance of 

 studying the chromosomal relations comparatively in a large num- 

 ber of species of a group. By such investigations not only may 

 much of importance be obtained regarding the evolution of cell 

 structures themselves, but by implication a criterion may thereby 

 be obtained for testing genetic relationships. In opening up this 

 line of research, I have drawn attention so far mainly to the 

 numerical relations of the chromosomes, and to the chromatin 

 nucleoli as representing chromosomes on the way to disappearance 

 during progressive evolution. These are the facts most easily 




270 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Marcll, 



determined; and there is the surety in such study that the chromo- 

 somes are relatively large structures, which exist in fact and are 

 not artificially produced by the mode of preparation necessary for 

 their study. The chromosomes are not apparently formed de 

 novo — at least there is as yet no good proof in any case that they 

 are so formed; while, on the contrary, there is a considerable 

 amount of evidence to show that they are structures which persist 

 from generation to generation, even though this is a persistence 

 nvolving a great amount of metabolic change. Astral radiations 

 appear and disappear, or at least disappear as radiations ; nucleoli 

 are apparently accumulations of metabolic substances of no 

 morphological regularity, as I have shown in another place; ^ and 

 recent experimental studies would show, though perhaps in contra- 

 diction to the anatomical studies, that the centrosomes may be 

 formed anew. But the chromosomes show more fully than any 

 of these cellular structures a certain degree of morphological 

 stability, and this fact, taken in connection with their greater 

 adaptability for study, entitles them to a basic place in the study 

 of the cell's evolution, as well as in the study of evolution in 

 general.

 LECTED IN NORTHEAST AFRICA BY DR. A. DONALDSON SMITH. 



BY JAMES A. C4. REHX. 



The material of which the present paper is a study was collected 

 by Dr. A. Donaldson Smith on his two expeditions into northeast 

 Africa, and presented by him to the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia. The first of the expeditions was made in the 

 years 1894 and 1895, and extended as far west as Lake Rudolf, 

 the whole account of which has been published in book form.' 

 The last expedition was made in 1899 and 1900, the route being 

 by Lake Rudolf on through the unknown to the Nile. On this 

 last expedition but two specimens of Orthoptera were collected. 

 The total number of specimens of Orthoptera secured is 239, per- 

 haps the most important collection ever brought from that country. 

 The remaining portion (Acrididce, LoemtidcB and Gryllidce) will 

 shortly be reported upon.

Apparently approaching E. arabica Saussure, l.iut differing in 

 numerous details; with E. aristides Lucas, from Suez, the rela- 

 tionship is also close, but that species is described as wingless. 



The specimens (or at least one of them) were collected in the 

 same character of country frequented by the other species of the 

 genus — barren and waterless plains or absolute deserts. 



Size medium. Head, with eyes, wider than deep (excluding 

 the clypeus), anterior border viewed superiorly truncate; antennae 

 slender. Prouotum sparsely tuberculate, broader anteriorly than 

 long, posteriorly converging; anterior border with a broad, low 

 central convexity which is perceptibly impressed in the median 

 section, ihe margin free; angles rect-acute angulate; posterior 

 border ^ipparently truncate.- Tegmina as in E. arabica, except 

 that the main veins ramify and become lost in the reticulations of 

 Ihe posterior portion of the tegmina. Wings well developed, 

 extending to the tips of the tegmina. Abdomen with the supra- 

 anal plate transverse, subsinuate centrally; subgenital plate rather 

 elongate, the apex broadly rounded. Limbs sparsely tuberculate, 

 the tubercles sometimes an-anged in regular series. Anterior 

 tibiae with four rather blunt spines on the external margin. Me- 

 dian and posterior femora each with a row of blunt teeth along 

 the posterior margin, the distal extremities bearing a moderate- 

 sized spine. Posterior tibiae slightly longer than the femora. 



General color ranging from purplish brown on the head and 

 pronotum to clay yellow on the abdomen. Eyes, labrum and 

 lower part of clypeus ferruginous. Exposed surface of tegmina 

 pale clay yellow becoming dull reddish centrally; lower surface 

 with a bar of blackish purple. Limbs and lateral borders of 

 pronotum pale yellowish pink, in one specimen (The Haud, July 

 13, 1894J the tibiie are obscurely ringed with whitish, in the 

 other (unknown locality and date) the temora are decidedly clay 

 yellow at the bases.

This rather peculiar species is evidently allied to T. media 

 Schulthess-Schindler' and T. cestuans Saussure", systematically and 

 geographically fitting between the two. From media it differs 

 in the form of the head, which is anteriorly truncate instead of 

 irregularly arcuate, and the prosternum which is unifasciate instead 

 of trifasciate; from cestuans it differs also in the form of the head, 

 and in the form and size of the joints ot the cerci. 



d*. — Size rather large, moderately robust. Head with vertex 

 transverse, subtruncate. Pronotum about twice as long as the 

 greatest width, considerably narrower posteriorly than anteriorly; 

 the anterior and posterior margins broadly rounded, the lateral 

 margins sinuate, the whole spineless; dorsum bearing four obsolete 

 tubercles cenirally. Tegmina long, surpassing the abdomen, 

 about four times as long as broad. Anterior limbs with the 

 femora rather stout and heavy, the external margin bearing five 

 large and twelve small teeth, the internal margin bearing twelve 

 teeth alternating in size. Median and posterior limbs lightly 

 built, hirsute. Abdomen rather slender. Cerci damaged. 



General color grayish brown suffused, except the tegmina, with 



dull purplish brown. Clypeus, labrum and facial shield ochrace- 



ous with four transverse blackish bars, the superior pair continued 



upon the olive-tinged eyes. Pronotum with the suffusing tint 



arranged in a pair of broken parallel lines along the median 



section, posteriorly tinged with green, the lateral margins being 



thickly speckled. Limbs irregularly marked with the suffusing 



tint, except the anterior coxfc and the lower surface of the tibial 



which are pale yellowish, the internal section of the tibia; being 



broadly lined with b'ack. Below dull yellowish except a single 



band of black across the prosternum. Tegmina hyaline, the 



longitudinal veins blackish irregularly broken by whitish spaces.

 anterior margin rather broadly rounded, the posterior truncate 

 with the angles cut oflf, the lateral margins sinuate, spined 

 throughout their length, one large spine anteriorly; the dorsum 

 with two obsolete tubercles near the anterior margin, and six paired 

 tubercles placed equidistant from the sulcus to within about three 

 millimeters of the posterior margin. Tegmina and wings short 

 and undeveloped. Anterior limbs with the tibiffi very deep and 

 robust, the external margin bearing five large and ten small spines,

This species differs from C. anomala Saussure in the much greater 

 size, in the nou-raamillate eyes, the smaller and weaker forelimbs, 

 and various other details. 



Form slender. Head elongate with a broad, low median ridge, 

 vertex not at ail prominent, ocelli small; eyes subelliptical; an- 

 tennse filiform. Pronotum rather elongate, slightly broader pos- 

 teriorly than anteriorly, the length being more than six times the 

 greatest width; lateral margins almost straight, slightly constricted 

 anterior to the insertion of the coxae, finely tuberculate; anterior 

 and posterior margins arcuate, the latter flattened centrally with 

 an obscure emarginatiou ; the whole surface finely tuberculate. 

 Tegmina abbreviate, semi-hyaline, rather coriaceous at the base. 

 Abdomen depressed, narrow, the lateral margins almost straight, 

 the basal and median segments one and a half times as long as wide, 

 terminal segments short, the posterior margins with a median 

 rounded lobe. Supraaaal plate triangular, moderately produced, 

 the apex truncate, subemargiuate and obscurely carinate centrally, 

 the latter flanked by two longitudinal depressions, each of which 

 is laterally bordered by another carince. Cerci broad, compressed,

composed of six segments increasing in length, the terminal one 

 ahnost half again as long as its predecessor, the whole bearing an 

 obsolete median ridge. Subgenilal plate compressed, deeply 

 folded, the central inclosure very nariow; styles moderately long, 

 subspatuiate. Anterior limbs very slight and weak; the coxaj and 

 femora being about the same length and bulk, the outer margin of 

 the latter bearing four very minute spines, discoidal spines num- 

 bering three; tibiffi not half as long as the femora, the margin not 

 dentate; metatarsi about as long as the tibiw. Median and pos- 

 terior pairs of limbs very long and slender; the median femora 

 each bearing two genicular spines; tibite longer than the femora. 

 General color pinkish brown, the limbs touched with dull brown- 

 ish; eyes testaceous; lower surface of the pronotum suffused with 

 dull reddish ; elytra decidedly pinkish at base; anterior femora 

 with a line of reddish black on the lower margin.

Closely allied to T. trigonalls Saussure" from South Africa, but 

 differing in the shape of the pronotum. The pronotum of trigonalis 

 is described as having " parte antice lata ac late rotundata, .... 

 marginibus hand dentatus;" while in the specimen before me the 

 pronotum is somewhat produced anteriorly, the margin being very 

 narrowly rounded.

THE IDENTITY OF THE GORDIACEAN SPECIES, CHORDODES MORGANI 

 AND C. PUERILIS, 



BY THOMAS H. MONTGOMERY, JR., PH.D. 



In a jirecediiig contribution' I described as new and distinct 

 species Chordodes morgani and C. puerilk, the former based on 

 two females, the latter on two males. The differences in the sculp- 

 turation of the surface of the cuticle seemed then to justify the 

 separation of these two species. In a later paper= 1 stated that 



Chordodes puerilk and C. morgani may eventually be found to 

 be the two sexes of the same species;" and the truth of this sup- 

 position is now confirmed. C. puerilis thus becomes a synonym of 

 C. morgani, since the latter -was first described in the original paper. 



Material consisting of seven females and five males, all collected 

 together at the same time (July 27, 1899), on the shore of South 

 Bass Island, in the western end of Lake Erie, in the explorations 

 of the Great Lakes conducted by the U. S. Fish Commission, were 

 very kindly sent to me for identification by Prof. Jacob E. Reig- 

 hard; and I am indebted to him and to Mr. George M. Bowers, 

 Fish Commissioner, for permission to publish my conclusions. An 

 examination on cross sections of the cuticle of a number of these 

 specimens shows very considerable variation, but variation with 

 intergradation; and shows also that there is more or less of a sex- 

 ual difference in the form of the papilla? of the cuticle. In each 

 individual the cuticle of the middle region of the body was ex- 

 amined. 



In the following description the original specimens, as well as 

 the new material, shall be described together. In my first paper 

 the form of the body was described, and there is nothing new to 

 be added to that account.

Size and Color. — The largest female (the type of C. morgani) 

 measures 222 mm. ia length, the largest male 220 mm., the 

 smallest individual seen (male, co-type of C. puerilis) 64 mm. 

 The color varies from a dull chocolate browa to a light bufi brown, 

 averagiuar darker in the males; the head end is ahvavs white. 



Cuticle. — Cross sections of the cuticle examined with high 

 powers show the following kinds of prominences: 



1. Low papilliB of irregular outline, rarely higher than broad, 

 which bear no spines. These are shown in Plate XI, figs. 1-3, 9. 

 In general they are, next to the following kind, the most numer- 

 ous, and are generally the smallest. 



2. The most numerous are small papilla?, rounded or more 

 frequently conical on outline, each of which bears a delicate, stiff 

 spine of nearly its own height. These are shown in Plate XI, tigs. 

 1-3, 5-11. Generally they are rather evenly distributed between 

 the larger papilke, but in one female (fig. 7) considerable portions 

 of the cuticle show them arranged in close patches, without papillie 

 in the spaces intervening. In none of the males was such an 

 arrangement found. 



3. Large papilke, considerably higher and broader than the pre- 

 ceding, shown in Plate XI, figs. 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11. Ia the small- 

 est female (length 12-5 mm.) these were entirely ab.5ent. Their 

 crowns are generally flattened or rounded, and bear each a circlet 

 of short, stiff, dehcate spines, few and variable in number; in the 

 largest female, the type of C. morgani, fig. 11, most of the pa])ill:e 

 were not provided with such spines. Sometimes, not frequently, 

 the bases of these papillre are tuberculated or dentated. In the 

 males these large papillse are generally higher than broad, except 

 in the smallest male (fig. 1, co-type of C. 2>uerili.s), where Ihey are 

 about as broad as high. In the females they are relatively less 

 numerou.s than in the males, and relatively broader and shorter, 

 more rectangular in outline and with their summits more regularly 

 flattened. Fig. 11 shows their appearance in the largest female, 

 which may be compared with the appearances in the largest males 

 (Plate XI, figs. 3, 5, 6). 



4. Small rounded papilloe, each of which bears on its summit a 

 long, hyaline, finger-shaped process (Plate XI, figs. 1, 3, 8, 11). 

 These are present in all the individuals, but very much less nu- 

 merous than any of the preceding kinds, generally occurring at 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 291 



considerable distances apart. Such processes are found iu most 

 species of the genus. 



5. Papill.^, each of \vhich bears a thick, more or less curved, 

 conical spine, refractive and homogeneous in appearance (Plate 

 Xr, figs. 2, 4, 11 J. The.se are the least numerous. I did not find 

 them in the specimens from Lake Erie, but they are present in the 

 types and co-types of morr/ani and pueriU.-i (I had overlooked 

 them at the time of my former description). The size and form 

 of the spines is variable. 



Surface views of the cuticle were given in my preceding paper. 

 In the males the large papilke (the third kind) always appear 

 darker and larger than the other papillai; they may be arranged 

 close together or, when less numerous, show the tendency to fol-m 

 large, irregular groups. In the largest females the cuticle on 

 surface view is like that of the males, except that the third kind 

 of papillai are less numerous; iu females which lack the third kind 

 of papillae, the darker disks on the surface of the cuticle represent 

 patches of papillte of the second kind. 



Diagnostic Chm-aders.—The sculpturatiou of the cuticle is so 

 variable that it is difficult to give a sharp diagnosis. But the 

 regular occurrence of papilke (the second kind) of more or less 

 conical form, each bearing a short delicate spine; the quite gen- 

 eral occurrence of higher papilla; (the third kind), each' generally 

 with a circlet of a few similar spines, and the occasional occurrence 

 of papillffi bearing each a thick conical spine, seem to distinguish 

 C. morgani from any hithero described species of the genus. But 

 the degree of variation in this form, individual and sexual, shows 

 how necessary it is to examine large series of individuals in 

 separating the species of the Gordiacea ; an individual variation 

 about as great is found in C. occidentalis Montg., as has been 

 shown by me in a preceding paper.^ 



All the specimens seen by me of Chordodes viorgani were from 

 the United States of America, from the following localities: Lake 

 Erie, Maryland, Iowa and Pennsylvania; thus it would seem to be 

 a species of the eastern portion of North America.

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW HEMIRAMPHID. 

 BY HEXRY W. FOWLER. 



The specimen described below was found among a miscellaneous 

 collectiou of small and young fishes presented to the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia many years ago by Dr. William 

 H. Jones, of the United States Navy. 



I propose a new genus and species for this specimen after a 

 comparison with equally small examples, some smaller, of Hypo- 

 rhamphus and Hemiramphus. These seem to differ but little 

 from the adults, and that principally in the shorter beak, which 

 is absent altogether in some. Perhaps a comparison of the adults 

 and young of the other members of tlie Heniiramphidce may 

 result in still greater differences. 



The specimen in question is strikingly like Fodiator acutus 

 (Cuvier and Valenciennes), which it resembles in many respects, 

 though differing altogether in having a beak one and a half times 

 the length of the head. The young of all the Exocmtidie exam- 

 ined do not differ materially from the adults, and it seems hardly 

 likely that a beak as long as the present specimen possesses is 

 developed in the young of Fodiator. Undoubtedly we have in 

 this specimen an annectant form between Eulcptorhamphus among 

 the Heniiramphidce and Fodiator among the Exocceiidce. 



HEMIEXOC(ETUS gen. nov. 



Body moderately elongate, compressed and covered with rather 

 large deciduous scales. The sides of the body are more or less 

 rounded and not especially flattened or compressed. The dorsal 

 and ventral lines are more or less parallel. The upper jaw is very 

 short, and the lower jaw is jiroduced into a long, jioiuted, slender 



beak, at least one and a half times as long as the head. Teeth 

 minute. Head large and the eye is also large. No finlets. Cau- 

 dal forked and the lower lobe much the longest and strongest. 

 D. and A. more or less similar, and the origin of the former in

advance of the latter. P. very long, reaching the origin of the 

 D. V. very long, reaching half-way in the space between their 

 own origins and the base of the caudal. 



HemiexoccEtus caudimaculatus sp. nov. 



No. 7,508. Type. Taken in lat. 2-3° N. long. 106° W. 

 (Mazatlan, Mexico). Dr. William H. Jones. 



The form of the body is somewhat elongate, moderately com- 

 pressed, with the sides more or less rounded, and with the dorsal 

 and ventral profile lines equally convex. The greatest depth of 

 the body is nearly median, and it is contained in the total length 

 (exclusive of the beak and the caudal) about six times. The 

 head is large and compressed, not veiy broad above, and contained 

 in Ihe body (as measured before) about four times. The eye is 

 large and superior, and it is contained in the head (exclusive of 

 the beak) about three times. The eye is also greater than the 

 interorbital space. The mouth is small and superior, and fur- 

 nished with minute teeth. Opercles large. The origin of the P. 

 is superior, level with the upper part of the eye, and near the 

 branchial aperture. Branchial apertures large. The P. are 

 exceedingly large and long, i-eaching at least tn the origin of the 

 D., and thus for about half the length of the V. The origin of 

 the V. is nearer the branchial aperture than the base of the caudal, 

 and the fins reach posteriorly for at least half the distance between 

 their own bases and the base of the caudal. The origin of the 

 D. in advance of that of the A., the fins similar, but the longest 

 rays of the former equal to the depth of the body at that point. 

 The general color of the body is a rich plumbeous brown above 

 and silvery beneath. The upper or outer rays of the P., except 

 the first, are blackish. The first ray of the P., together with the 

 5 basal rays, white. D. and A. brownish. V. edged upon the 

 outer and inner rays with white, the inner rays blackish like the 

 same of the P. Caudal whitish, except the bases of the rays and 

 the jet black spot upon the outer portion of the lower lobe. The 

 body was covered with rather large scales, but as the squamation 

 is injured I am unable to give any count. Traces of a lateral 

 line existed upon the inferior scales along the sides of the ventral 

 region. D. 10, A. 11, P. 11.

A STUDY OF THE GENUS CENTUEIO. 

 BY JAMES A. G. KEHN. 



A recent study of the Bats in the collection of the Academy 

 revealed the fact that three alcoholic specimens of the curious 

 genus Centurio were preserved therein. As comparatively little 

 material of the genus had ever been examined, I secured, tlirough 

 Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, Jr., a loan of the three representatives con- 

 tained in the collection of the United States National Museum. 

 The acquisition of these specimens considerably enlarged the series 

 for examination so that it numbered five alcoholic specimens, one 

 skin and one odd skull. 



AVith this series, probably the largest ever gathered together, I 

 have made some notes and observations, the results of which have 

 induced me to publish a summary of our knowledge of the genus. 



Record of Specimens. — The first specimen of Centurio known to 

 naturalists was collected on the cruise of H. M. K. "Sulphur," 

 and was examined by Dr. Gray, of the British Museum, who 

 described the genus and applied the specific name senex to the 

 specimen.^ The locality was slated to be Amboyna, but later' 

 Gray seemed doubtful of this, as he says: " Captain Sir Edward 

 Belcher informed me this bat was found in Amboyna, but IMr. 

 Hinds (surgeon of the expedition) does not appear to be so confi- 

 dent on the subject, and rather suspects it came from South 

 America. It was taken from a bottle containing animals from 

 both countries." 



In 18.54 Lichtenstein and Peters described a specimen supposed 

 to be from Cuba as C. flacogulari^,^ but later Alston^ informs us 

 Dr. Peters had written him that the locality was erroneous. 



Saussure was the next author to inform us further regarding this 

 genus, a specimen from ' ' les re'gions chaudes du ^lexique ' ' being 

 described by him as C. mexicanus.^

from 3Iirador, jNIexico, with the throat folds greatly developed 

 caused Dr. Harrison Allen to describe the subgenus Trichocoryes 

 and the species mcmurtril, which he j)lficed t herein. ° A specimen 

 of C. mexicanus from the same locality accompanied the one 

 described. Alston mentions' that Dr. Peters had informed him 

 that the Berlin INIuseum possessed a specimen of C. mcmurtrii as 

 well as one of C. senex. 



The only remaining published record of specimens of this genus 

 is that of one female from Cerro de los Pajeros, Las Vegas, Vera 

 Cruz, Mexico, which was described by ilr. Henry L. "Ward as a 

 new species, Centurio minor.' 



General Relations. — A very suijerficial examination of a speci- 

 men of Centurio reveals the gap which exists between it and the 

 other genera of the subfamily in which it has previously been 

 placed. Of the genera of the Stenodermatimt I have examined 

 all but two, i.e., Ametrida and Edophylla, and the resulting belief 

 is that Centurio should stand apart. The singular facial structure, 

 throat folds, absence of true nose-leaf, and peculiar canines all 

 present an individuality not shared by the other genei-a, 



Accordingly I propose to separate Centurio as a new subfamily, 

 the differential characters of which would Ije as follows : 



STENODEEMATIN^. CEXTUEIONIN.E. 



Rostral portion of skull not very Rnstral portion of skull very 



broad (except in Splueronyc- broad.

The Centurionince have no close affinity with the other divisions 

 of the Phyllostomatidw, for while some of the above characters are 

 shared by the Mormooplme, the absence of enlarged cutaneous 

 plates on the lower lip immediately shows the distinctness of the 

 subfamilies. The genetic relations are undoubtedly with the 

 Stenodermatince, but to which portion of it seems doubtful, though 

 Sphmromjderis is possibly the closest related of any.

The characters used liy most of the describers of these species

The color differences are slight and can readily be accounted for 

 by the diflerence of time of immei"sion in alcohol. The upper 

 incisors also appear to be both two and three lobate, beside 

 bluntly conic.

Type Locality. — Erroneously given as " Amboyna "' (East 

 Indies). As Gray afterward believed, it in all probability came 

 from America, and a comparison of the route of the " Sulphur " 

 (on the voyage of which the specimen was collected) with the 




298 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



present distribution of the species shows that the specimen was 

 evidently collected on the west coast of Mexico or Central Amer- 

 ica, at some one of the points visited between San Bias and 

 Panama. 



Distribution. — The only accurate records for the occurrence of 

 this species give us little information as to its exact distribution. 

 Aside from ilirador and Cerro de los Pajeros, Vera Cruz, Mexico, 

 the only other accurate captures are from Guatemala' and Cartago, 

 Costa Rica; U. S. Nat. Mus., No. if Hi- 

 lt has been recorded from " les regions chaudes du Mexique " 

 by Saussure, and erroneously from Cuba by Lichteustein and 

 Peters. The whole data shows the species to range from south- 

 central Mexico (Cerro de los Pajeros) to Costa Rica (Cartago), 

 probably within zonal limits, but as to this we know little, for 

 while both of the localities in the State of Vera Cruz are well 

 elevated (above 6,000 feet), Cartago lies in a valley between moder- 

 ately high ranges of mountains, and Saussure's specimen was stated 

 to have come from the warm section of Mexico. 



General Characters. — Those of the genus and subfamily of 

 which it is the only representative. 



Head. — Short, broad and deep; the upper lip emarginate, the 

 lower jaw extending beyond the upper, both with the margin 

 beaded. Face with a median depression between the eyes, this 

 being flanked by a fold of skin with a sinuate border, superior to 

 this lies a semicircular thickening, above which, between the ears, 

 is a large appressed fan-like structure with a crenulate border; 

 above each eye lies an irregular protuberance, between the eyes 

 extends a narrow sinus which forms the lower margin of the foMs 

 mentioned above; between the nostrils lies a flat oblong plate, the 

 upper borde*" of which is rounded in some specimens aud produced 

 in others, the nostrils being laterally bordered by raised converg- 

 ing ridges which terminate below in lobes on the upper lip on each 

 side of the central cmargiuation, tlie latter having a small central 

 lobule. The chin folds in the male are highly developed, num- 

 bering three, the anterior one extending from one corner of tlie 

 mouth to the other, and the posterior one from antitragus to 

 antitragus, the whole being more or less thickly and heavily haired; 



I 



' Peters, see Alston, Biol. Cent. Amer., Mamm., p. 52. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 299 



the anterior fold bears a central thickening which is enlarged and 

 extends back toward the second fold which bears a central glandu- 

 lar structure, the third fold having a fold of skin of very ''consid- 

 erable lateral extent, the whole when pulled forward covering the 

 lower part of the face as a mask; the female presenting rudimen- 

 tary folds on much the same pattern. Ears not exceeding the 

 muzzle and bearing a large, rather elongate, apically rounded lobe 

 on the internal margin ; tragus moderately long, the external mar- 

 gin bearing several lobules, those near the apex usually little 

 developed. 



im6«.— Forearm of moderate length, the thumb compressed, 

 the third finger moderately long. Tibia and foot rather weak. 

 Calcaneum short. 



^lembvanesandFur.—Memhr&nea moderately tough; the inter- 

 space between the fourth and fifth digits and the digital area of 

 the mesopatagiura transversely gathered, the tension bars being 

 corded. Uropatagium reaching beyond the middle of the femora, 

 the margin haired. The fur extends upon the wing membrane to 

 a line drawn between the elbow and knee. 



Cofo;-.— General color above between drab and broccoli brown 

 (Ridgway's Nomenclature, PI. Ill), tending toward isabelline in 

 some alcoholic specimens and mummy brown (PI. Ill) in others; 

 below isabelline. Membrane rather pale mars brown (PI. Ill), 

 the interspace between the second and third digits, the gathered 

 portions of the mesopatagium and of the interspace between the 

 fourth and fifth digits semi-transparent. 



Skull. — The skull is short and deep, with the rostral portion 

 very broad and steeply descending. Zygoma flaring. Palate 

 short, twice as broad as long, the cleft being acute-angulate ante- 

 riorly. Auditory biillse flattened and not very conspicuous. The 

 figure given by Peters (I.e.) is excellent and will show many 

 points hard to bring out in a description. 



Teeth. — Upper incisors small, the central pair largest though 

 little exceeding the others in vertical extent: apex bluntly conic, 

 bifid or trifid; upper canines robust, with an anterior basal con- 

 cavity; upper premolars very unequal in size, the first half the 

 size of the second which bears several lobules on the posterior 

 margin; upper molars twice as broad as long, the crowns rather 

 flat with three principal cusps, the anterior one larger, the external 




300 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



margin of each bearing one prominent anterior lobe and several 

 posterior to this, the last one of which is considerably developed 

 in the first molar. Lower incisors small, uniform, bifid: lower 

 canines hastate, with an external basal shoulder; lower premolars 

 unequal, the first a simple cone, the second larger, with a posterior 

 shoulder; lower molars low, the anterior somewhat larger than the 

 posterior, the latter ranging from subquadrate to subtriangulate in 

 section, each bearing two low angulate cusps. 



Remarks. — It is evident that the species presents some diversity 

 in size and probably some in color, but it is quite as evident that 

 such variation is individual or sexual (the males being on an aver- 

 age slightly larger than the female), and cannot be separated into 

 geographic forms. The single specimen from Costa Rica cannot 

 be separated from specimens from Vera Cruz, Mexico, and the five 

 specimens (three males, two females) from Mirador present con- 

 siderable variation among themselves. 



The species described by Lichtenstein and Peters ( C. flavogu- 

 laris) and Saussure ( C. mexicanus) can readily be placed as syno- 

 nyms of C. senex, Peters afterwai'd admitting such to be the case 

 with C. fiavogularis ; and Saussure's C. mexieantis can be matched 

 with specimens of senex, the difference in color being very likely 

 due to the length of immersion in the preserving fluid. The species 

 C. mcmurtrii H. Allen was based on the adult male," the folds 

 being in all probability secondary sexual characters. 



A close examination of the description of C. minor ^Vard shows 

 that the describer was probably misled by Dobson's description of 

 the chin folds, and in the absence of material for comparison he 

 described a female which agrees exactly with two females before me; 

 the discrepancies in measurement beng simply individual, while 

 the second lower premolar of all the available specimens is more 

 than half the size of the first and some are decidedly not triangu- 

 lar in section. The describer of C. minor stated that he would not 

 be surprised " if minor should eventually prove to lie but a variety 

 of senex."

 odd skull.

THE LIMITS OF VARIATION IN PLANTS. 

 BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGER, PH.D. 



One of the most important questions on which the work of the 

 biologist should be brought to bear is the problem of species. We 

 see all living nature — animals and plants — divided into groups 

 which are denominated species. These groups are often clearly 

 and sharply defined, and, on the other baud, often very 

 irregularly characterized. What are the causes which have 

 brought this about ? What are the facts underlying the phe- 

 nomenon of species ? Two difficulties are presented to the earnest 

 student who attempts to formulate an answer to the above-men- 

 tioned questions. The well-known reasoning starts from the fact 

 that more animals or plants are born than can survive; some must 

 therefore perish and leave no descendants, and only those persist 

 which have structures and aptitudes that fit those organisms pos- 

 sessing them to bear their part in the struggle for existence. On 

 the whole, we find that the fittest will survive and breed. 



The first difficulty which presents itself is one which hangs on 

 the magnitude of the variations by which new forms arise. What 

 are the limits of variation ? The older books on evolution consider 

 that the variations by which new species arise are at first small. 

 But if they are small, how can they be sufficiently useful to give 

 to those organisms possessing them an advantage in the struggle for 

 existence ? This is the difficulty of small or initial variations. 



The second difficulty is one known as that of the swamping effect 

 of intercrossing. Granting that variations do occur, how can they 

 be perpetuated ? For if the varying individuals breed with each 

 other, will not these variations be obliterated ? 



The following statistical study was undertaken with the purpose 

 of answering the first question, viz. : By what steps — by what 

 integral changes, of what size — did the new form come into exist- 

 ence? At the International Botanical Congress, held in Paris in 

 1900, M. Angel Gallardo spoke highly of the employment of the 




304 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



statistical method in the study of variation/ and it appears to the 

 writer that this method is the only accurate and scientific one that 

 can be employed. Several plants, therefore, were chosen, because 

 of their easy procurement, and measurements were made of their 

 several parts and these measurements tabulated. Several striking 

 facts were brought out during the course of the statistical inquiry, 

 and these are referred to in their proper place throughout the 

 paper. 



The following common plants were chosen for a somewhat 

 detailed measurement of the parts mentioned, viz. : Fruits of the 

 May apple {Podophxjllum peltatum'), leaves of the tulip poplar 

 (Liriodendron tulipifera), leaves of the Japanese ivy {Ampelopm 

 Veitchii), fruits of white oak {Quercus alba), fruits of the swamp 

 chestnut oak (Quercus prinus palusti-k), leaves of the moon-seed 

 {Meni»permum canadense), entire j^lants of Indian turnip (Ari- 

 swma triphyllum), leaves of bloodroot {Sanguinaria canadeimi^), 

 leaves of the tree of heaven (Ailanthius glandulosai) — the latter 

 plant not being studied statistically, but in a comparative way to 

 bring out some peculiarities of its pinuation. The material was 

 used either in the green condition or it was used in the preserved 

 state (dry or alcoholic). In all cases where leaves were taken, 

 careful tracings were made by a sharp-pointed lead pencil upon 

 ordinary drawing or manila paper, and these tracings were after- 

 ward accurately measured. The character of the material, 

 whether fresh, dry or alcoholic, is mentioned in connection with 

 the subjoined tables. Prof. Halsted- has shown that leaves suffer 

 in drying, but in drying, as they all maintain the same relative 

 size, the results which are mainly comparative do not seem 

 to be vitiated. 



The measurement of the linear dimensions of the leaves and 

 parts of the plants was made by a standardized boxwood scale 

 manufactured by Keuffel &. Essler Co., New York, which ruler 

 was divided into centimeters, millimeters and half-millimeters, the 

 lenglh of the scale being twenty centimeters in all. Supei-ficial 

 dimensions, in order to be accurate and expressive of the real size 

 of the leaf or other part, require a detailed trigonometrical calcu-

lation of areas by means of Ihe angles and the sides of plane and 

 spherical triangles, the sides of squares, rectangles, trapezoids 

 and the like. Nothing being gained by such a mathematical 

 study, measurements of the superficial extent of the vegetal parts 

 are omitted. Linear dimensions in the tables are given in deci- 

 meters, centimeters and millimeters. 



The weight of the fiuit and seeds of the May apple are given in 

 grams and decimals of the gram. The volume in cubic centime- 

 ters was determined by the amount of distilled water displaced by 

 putting the fruits, the carefully cleaned and dried seeds, in a vessel 

 filled to the brim with that liquid. 



The linear measurements of the veins of the leaves used were 

 obtained by adopting the following method of procedure. The 

 midrib was first carefully measured, then the first line drawn on 

 the left side from the base of the leaf to the apex of the first left 

 lobe, and the second and third lines were also measured in the 

 same manner.' The length of the parts on the right side was then 

 determined, as also the depth in certain cases of the sinuses, 

 beginning with the first sinus on the left of the middle lobe. 

 Proceeding in the same way, after completing the measurements on 

 the left, the right-hand side of the leaf was measured, the apex 

 pointing away from one's person. The greatest width of the 

 several lobes is also given in the tables, and the width of the 

 widest portion of the leaf itself is also stated by way of a com- 

 parison. 



Measurements. 



Podophyllum peltatum (Mayapple). 



Twenty fruits were gathered in an open wood, carefully washed 

 and wiped to remove adhering soil particles. After weighing, the 

 volume of each fruit was determined, and afterward the seeds were 

 removed, dried carefully, cleaned and weighed. The volume of 

 the seeds was also ascertained by displacement. By subtracting 

 the weight of the seeds from the weight of the fruit, the weight of 

 the pulp may be ascertained, and in the same manner, by sub- 



' Measuremeuts of the fifth and sixth leaves of Table IV, part 1 were made 

 from a base Ime drawn from lowest part of the two basal lolies. In the 

 same manner also for leaves 1, 2, 3 of Table III, part 1, for D and E leaver

~7i^^d7^3 table shows that the size of the fruits and the

 of water. The smallest fruit (No. 19) with 2 seeds weighed 25. 2* 

 grams less, and displaced 10 c.c. of water a difference of 26 c.c^ 

 Ihis difference is due, without doubt, to imperfect ertihzatiou of 

 the ovules of the nineteenth plant. However, if we compare 

 fruits No. 3 and No. 11, having the same number of good seeds, 

 we find a very considerable difference; or if we institute a com- 

 parison betwein fruits No. 5 and No. 17, we find the variations 

 i be even more striking. The table also shows that he weight of 

 the fruit largely depends on the amount of the pulpy pericarp. 

 Sanguinaria canadensis (Bloodroot). 



There arise from the rootstock of this plant two lanceolate, 

 membranous scale leaves, and a single palmate glaucous foliage 

 iTvariouslv lobed, sometimes only undulate. A reference to the 

 table wU show that the thirty-three leaves taken for comparison 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 307 



are extremely variable, the variations being within wide limits. 

 The first leaf, an evolved one, was the largest one measured. If 

 it is contrasted with a juvenile leaf No. 15, one of the smallest 

 leaves, a wide divergence is noted. It is important, however, to 

 notice here that an absolute comparison cannot be drawn, because 

 of the wide variation in parts of the leaves themselves. For ex- 

 ample, although in most of its dimensions leaf No. 15 is a small 

 one, yet its midrib is longer than the midrib of No. 9, which is 

 a middle-sized one. Therefore in comparing the large leaf No. 1 

 with the smallest leaf No. 15, these variables must be taken into 

 consideration. 



It is important to distinguish between the juvenile and adult 

 forms of leaves. The diflerences in the construction of the juve- 

 nile and adult form are in general more different when the external 

 conditions to which they are severally adapted are different; 

 whilst if these do not operate, the primary leaves with which we 

 have here first to deal are only arrested formations. In many plants- 

 reversion of the adult to the juvenile form frequently occurs. 

 Evidently leaf No. 15 represents a juvenile form of leaf, that is, 

 one derived from a rootstock which has been directly formed froni 

 the seedling plant, and the larger more deeply lobed leaves, such 

 as No. 1, represent forms derived from a rhizome which has per- 

 sisted for some years. In makiug these statistical measurements, 

 therefore, the amount of the difference between the juvenile and 

 adult forms is clearly set forth, as also the adult leaf variations 

 mathematically expressed. 



In the accompanying tables (II and Ila), L. = length, W. = 

 width of lobe, a star (*) beside a number indicates tha^ the deter- 

 mination of the width of that lobe was made by measuring the 

 length of a perpendicular from a line drawn from the base of a 

 leaf to the apex of the lobe. The measurements were made from 

 a basal point where the primary veins of the leaf meet. Fresh 

 leaves were used in making the sketches from which the dimensions 

 later were taken. The lowest point of the leaf was ascertained by 

 measuring from the vein of the last and lowest lobe of the leaf on the 

 right and left sides to the apex of the most projecting curve or 

 angle toward the base of the leaf. The breadth of the leaf was 

 determined by measuring across the widest portion of the leaf 

 lamina.

Liriodendrou tulipifera (Tulip Poplar). 



The leaves of this tree are extremely variable, ami different 

 forms of leaves are found by careful examination on the same tree, 

 as so clearly shown by Holm,* who has reduced many of the 

 fossil species established by Heer, Lesquereux and Saporta to the 

 tulipifera form, by finding that a large number of the fossil leaves 

 upon which specific characters were founded are duplicated by the 

 leaves from living trees. Goebe? has shown that it is necessary, 

 in studying leaf forms, to contrast the juvenile and adult condi- 

 tions, because these vary from each other within wide limits. It 

 is of course impossible to limit these sharply. The difference 

 between these juvenile stages and the adult form may be more or 

 less great. The present statistical in([uiry is intended to mathe- 

 matically contrast these variations. The juvenile forms of leaves 

 in lAriodendron , beginning with the first leaf above the cotyle- 

 dons, may be described as follows: The first leaf is nbreuiform, 

 i.e, two rounded lobes and rather deep angular sinus; the second 

 leaf is approximately bilobed, somewhat squarer than a typical 

 obcordate leaf; the third and fourth leaves are deltoid with shallow 

 apical sinus, and therefore almost horizontal on top; the fifth 

 leaf from the cotyledons is four-lobsd with deep, rounded left and 

 right sinuses, shallow apical sinus and two distinct obtuse apical 

 lobes; the sixth leaf is entire, almost square, with two small lateral 

 lobes and narrowed apical portion. In general, the first four or 

 even five leaves on the very young tulip tree have the same form 

 as the oldest and youngest on the branches of the full-grown tree. 

 The best description of the adult leaf is by A. Michaux,* as fol- 

 lows: " Foliis ab.scisso-truncatis, quadri-lobatis," and this descrip- 

 tion has been accepted by such authorities as Bentham and Hooker, 

 and Gray. Brittou' describes the leaves in this manner: " Leaves 

 glabrous, very broadly ovate or nearly orbicular in outline, trun- 

 cate or broadly notched at the apex, truncate, rounded or cordate 

 at the base, 3'-6' long with 2 apical and 2-4 basal lobes with 

 rounded sinuses, or occasionally entire." The juvenile leaves, as 

 above described, vary remarkably from those adult forms described

SO carefully by Britton and Michaux. lu order to correlate the 

 diflferent varieties with one another, it is necessary to ask two ques- 

 tions: Is the leaf form an arrested one, or does it rej^reseut an 

 advanced condition of growth ? I believe that all the forms known 

 can be classified either as arrested, evolved or reverted forms. 

 Before, however, making this classification, it is necessary to state 

 the fact that the oldest and voungest leaf on the same branch 

 show an entirely diflferent form from the intermediate ones, of 

 which the form with four-lobed leaf may be taken as the normal 

 one for our Liriodendron tulipiferaJ The fact that the oldest 

 and youngest leaf on the same branch can difl^er so much from the 

 other ones seems to be almost constant for the full-grown tree. It 

 must also be emphasized that the intermediate leaves have, in- 

 stead of four lobes, sometimes six or even eight lobes as teeth. 



Arreded Leaves. — The oldest and youngest leaves which have a 

 shape somewhat like those of the seedling plant are evidently 

 arrested ones. The primordiura of the youngest leaf of a normal 

 branch has been arrested in its development at a certain stage, and 

 therefore the leaf exhibits an evident often extremely different 

 configuration. 



Reverted Leaves. — The gigantic leaves from the sprouts (meas- 

 ures below) evidently belong to this category, and are in shape 

 like leaf No. 5 of the seedling tree. 



Evolved Leaves. — The four-lobed leaves, whether provided with 

 deep or shallow sinuses, and the six to eight-lobed leaves referred 

 to above have acquired their different character by passing through 

 a further transformation. In other cases where thi.s rough classi- 

 fication does not apply, the form of the leaf may be explained by 

 the persistence or duration of the juvenile form, which produces 

 leaves scarcely less variable than the others mentioned above. All 

 of these facts have been taken into consideration in making the 

 measurements. 



In Table III are presented the measurements of two terminal 

 normal branches, tha leaves being counted from the base in an 

 ascending direction. The amount of variation is shown by com- 

 paring the leaves of the same position on the two shoots. The 

 statistical study of the youngest, oldest and intermediate leaves of 

 the normal branch brings out quantitatively the effect which the 

 light exercises upon the development of the leaves. That light is

the controlliEg influence in regulating the size of dorsiventral 

 organs, such as foliage leaves, has been abundantly proven. The 

 measurements presented in Table III will at some future time be 

 •compared with those obtained from seedling plants, so as more 

 clearly lo present statistically the similarity of the youngest and 

 oldest leaves of the normal shoot and the juvenile ones of the 

 seedling tree. 



Table IV presents the statistical study of the leaves of a normal 

 shoot taken from a tree growing at Raven Rock, Pa. In compar- 

 ing the figures of tliis table with those of Table III, it is necessary 

 to read from the bottom up, leaf No. 7 of Table IV being com- 

 pared with leaf No. 1 of Table III. 



The leaves obtained from sprouts growing from a stump were out 

 of all proportion to the size of the leaves on normally produced 

 shoots. Table V shows the largest of the leaves studied to be .370 

 mm. long and .432 ram. wide. A comparison also of the leaves of 

 the sprouts wth each other indicates that a very considerable vari- 

 ation occurs. By contrasting these sprout leaves with normal ones, 

 the limits of the variations in this one plant are clearly set forth. 

 Variations which are due to the reversion of the sprout leaves to 

 the juvenile forms on the seedling plants, however, enormously 

 increased in size. It should be mentioned, also, that the stijjules 

 of the leaves on' the sprouts are correspondingly increased in size, 

 are permanent and assimilative, not caducous, as the small stipules 

 of normal leaves. Measurements of these stipules are also given:

The size of the nuts enclosed by the cupule in the oak varies in 

 an interesting manner. The fruits of two species of oak collected 

 by Dr. J. T. Rothrock on October 19, 1863, were studied statis- 

 tically. It is supposed that the fruits in drying preserved the same 

 relative size that they had when in the fresh, fully ripe condition. 

 The three swamp chestnut oaks from which the fruits were obtained 

 were standing close together, and each was fully three feet in 

 diameter. Table VIII presents the measurements of the swamp 

 chestnut oak acorns, and Table VII those of the white oak :

Ailanthtts glandulosa (Tree of Heaven). 



Some interesting facts were brought out in the study of the leaves 

 of this species. Two kinds of leaves were met with, viz., trans- 

 formed or evolved leaves and arrested ones. In order properly to 

 understand the variations which have taken place, it is necessary 

 to refer to the seedling condition as a starting-point. According 

 to Lubl)ock,' the first leaves are compound, trifoliate, petiolate, 

 €xstipulate; terminal leaflets acuminate, subacute, entire; lateral 

 ones slightly toothed, ultimately glabrescent, petiolate, light green, 

 alternately pinnate-nerved ; petioles ribbed or striated, covered 

 ■with short glandular hairs; the young leaves are also covered with 

 fine silky hairs near their edges. The normal fully developed 

 leaves are pinnate with an odd leaflet provided, as a rule, with 

 from 5 to 9 pairs of lateral leaflets. The youngest leaves of the 

 side or terminal branches are juveniie in form and of two kinds, 

 viz., undeveloped or arrested juveniles and seedling juveniles. For 

 example, on one branch the lowest leaf is broadly lanceolate with 

 two small lobes with glandular apices on the upper enlire margin; 

 the lower side has a larger glandular tipped lobe and an acute 

 sinus. This leaf is an arrested juvenile one, the primordium 

 growing out into the terminal leaflet before the formation of the 

 paired lateral ones. The second leaf of the same branch is pin- 

 nately trifoliate; the lateral paired leaflets asj-mmetric, cut away 

 obliquely on the lower margin and rounded on the upper, while the 

 terminal leaflet is broadly ovate, acuminate with a single basal, 

 glandular-tipped lobe on the upper margin. The other leaves of 

 this branch are pinnate with an odd leaflet provided with 5 to 6 

 pairs of lateral leaflets. The odd leaflet is lanceolate with two 

 glandular teeth on the lower margin and one on the upper. 



The second branch studied shows a somewhat similar condition 

 of affairs; the earliest formed leaf is more deeply lobed at the 

 base, each lobe with rather deep sinuses, the upper narrow sinus 

 cutting in almost to the midrib. The terminal leaflets of the 

 pinnate leaves are also narrowly lanceolate with glandular teeth 

 at the base. One leaf, however, is abruptly pinnate by the non- 

 development of the terminal odd leaflet. 



Two divergent types of leaves may be said thus to exist on the 

 aame tree, one type of leaf being due to the arrestment of the 



» 1892, Lubbock, Seedlings, I, p. 327. 




318 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMV OF [April, 



lerminal odd leaflet. Several steps in this suppression of tlie odd 

 leaflet were gathered. One pinnate foliage leaf shows a very 

 narrow somewhat unequally trilobed odd leaflet; another a still 

 narrower almost linear, glandular-toothed terminal leaflet. A 

 third one has a filiform odd leaflet; a fourth pinnate foliage leaf 

 has a simple boss in place of the odd leaflet, this small protuber- 

 ance seeming to persist as a rudiment in all of the leaves studied. 

 This arrestment of the normal development is carried a step far- 

 ther, the terminal paired lateral leaflets beginning to manifest a 

 reduction in size, becoming in one leaf studied small, elliptical in 

 outline with a retuse apex, all the other leaflets studied having an 

 acuminate apex. The other line of variation starts with the 

 lanceolate odd leaflet which becomes increasingly broader. Some 

 have a rounded, retuse apex, others have an acuminate point. 

 From simple glandular teeth at the base of the odd leaflet, these 

 glandular teeth increase in size until they become glandular tipped 

 lobes separated from each other by rather shallow, acute sinuses, 

 this line of advanced development proceeding until the terminal 

 leaflet reaches a broadly ovate, trilobed form, each lobe being 

 narrowly acuminate. Finally, as if to approach a climax, one of 

 these lobes becomes almost distinct at the base, but is still concres- 

 ceut with the basal part of the leaflet and the upper side of its 

 petiole. In another leaf gathered, as representing the climax, 

 this lanceolate entire basal lobe is separated by the cutting in of 

 the sinus to the midrib; the asymmetric upper portion also becomes 

 deeply lolled by the formation of roumled depressions. The lateral 

 intermediate leaflets of the pinnate leaves are all asymmetric with 

 an oblique base, the obliquity inclining downward. A glandular 

 tooth is usually found on the upper and lower margins; if three 

 glands are present, two are found on the lower margin, one,on the 

 upper. If only one gland is present it is always on the rounded, 

 oblique lower edge. Occasionally a h;isul, rounded, 'glandular- 

 tipped lobe is found on the lower edge of the lateral pinn.'e of a 

 large foliage leaf. We cannot doubt that asymmetry of leaflets 

 chiefly appears when their parts are unsymmetrically related to 

 their environment." We may say in general, with Herbert Spen- 

 cer, that that side of the leaf is the smaller which is shaded, and 



" Herbert Spencer, Principles of Biology, 11, p. 1 13. 




1901.] NATDEAL SCIJiNCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 319 



that the obliquity of the leaf is occasioned by its fitting itself to 

 utilize the space at its disposal. 



Summary and Conclusiok. 



1. This study of the limits of variations in plants was under- 

 taken as, in part, a contribution to the problem of species. 



2. Moreover, this study was undertaken to provide statistical 

 data which would throw light upon the difficulty, from an evolu- 

 tionary standpoint, of small or initial variations. 



3. Considerable variation in the size and shape of leaves is evi- 

 dent, and the amount of the variation was determined statistically; 

 the weight and volume of fruits were calculated ; the number of 

 seeds was determined. 



4. The quantitative amount of variation in the juvenile, arrested 

 and transformed leaves of a number of plants was also determined 

 and tabulated. 



5. In Idriodendron tulipifera, SarKjuinaria canadensis, and Ailan- 

 thiis glandulosa it was ascertained that variation in the size and 

 configuration of the leaves of these plants is in part due to (he 

 persistence of juvenile forms, to the arrested development of such 

 leaves, to their evolution and transformation to higher forms. The 

 amount of these differences was also tabulated. 



6. In conclusion, it may be stated that these changes in most 

 cases are due to two causes: the internal hereditary impulse deter- 

 mining, as in Ailanthus glandulosa, the asymmetry of the lateral 

 paired leaflets, and the direct environmental influence fitting 

 the leaf to utihze the space at its disposal, and thus enabling it 

 to present the largest amount of leaf surface to light action. We 

 have, therefore, in the tables an exact mathematical expression 

 of the influence of the various operating factors which determine 

 plant form.

Demonstration that Plants give off Oxygen. — De. Ida A. Keller 

 remarked that there is no process in plant life of greater import- 

 ance than the evolution of oxygen in the sj-nthetic preparation of 

 starch by the chlorophyll in the presence of sunlight. In teaching 

 such physiological phenomena it is important to demonstrate them 

 in such a manner as to leave no doubt in the mind of the puijil. 

 The method usually described (by Detmer and others) to illustrate 

 this process is quite familiar to all students of botany. It is I'epre- 

 sented by figure 1. 



A piece of Elodea Canadensis is placed in a jar containing 

 water. A funnel is inverted over the plant and a test tube filled 

 ■with water is inverted over the funnel. The water is charged with 

 carbon dioxide and the apparatus is placed in the sunhght. Very 

 soon bubbles of gas are disengaged and collected in the test tube. 

 The gas may then be shown to be oxygen. On account of )he 

 limited capacity of the apparatus employed and the comparatively 

 small extent of the .assimilating surface, this method is not very 

 useful for purposes of demonstration because of the small volume 

 of gas liberated. 



I

holding two or three Htres ia employed and into this a considerable 

 quantity of Cabomba CaroUniana or Myriophyllum spicatum is 

 iiitroduced (fig. 2). The water is thoroughly charged with carbon 

 dioxide and the plants are then exposed to the sunb'ght. Little 

 streams of gas are seen to pass upward from various points, and 

 when sufficient gas has collected at the top of the tlask^ the latter 

 is immersed in a tank of water in a horizontal position in such a 

 manner that the gas is directly under the opening (iig. 3). On 

 turning the stop-cock and applying a splinter of wood with a 

 spark on the end of it the gas will be found to be oxygen. 



When the supply of carbon dioxide in the water has been 

 exhausted the plant will no longer give off bubbles of oxygeu. 

 The process may be again initiated by passing carbon dioxide into 

 the receiver. Before testing it is best to allow the carbon dioxide 

 to become exhausted, since in recharging the water it is impossible 

 to_ avoid collecting some of this gas over the liquid and adulter- 

 ating the oxygen. On standing it is gradually absorbed by the 

 water and consumed by the plant. In any case the gas collected is 

 not pure oxygen, but it is sufficiently rich in this substance to 

 make au eflective demonstration.

Structure of Diatoms. —Mr. Frank J. Keeley remarked that 

 in studymg the structure of diatom valves some years ao-o the 

 method employed : mounting broken valves at right angles^o the 

 cover glass, proved efficient for most of the coarsely marked form« 

 but failed with certain species of Aulacodlscics. 



Such forms as A. Sollittianus, A. margarataceous, etc., yielded 

 satisfactory secuonal views and proved not to differ materially in 

 structure from Coscmodisms ; but another group, includiu^' A 

 Oreganm A. Rogersii, A. Jaai.schU, etc., proved too opaque for 

 the elucidation of their structure by this method. Further exam- 

 21 




322 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



ination of fragments in which the platea were separated indicated, 

 however, that the typical "honeycomb" cellular structure was 

 likewise present in these species, but masked by the unusual char- 

 acter of the external plate, which differs from that of other dia- 

 toms in having the finer secondary structure between, rather than 

 over, the large cells of the middle plate. 



Recently, with the view of further determining the relations of 

 this structure to that of other species, a special mount was_ pre- 

 pared, including A. Oreganus, A. Bogersii, with typical species of 

 Coseinodiscus, Trieeratium, Actinocydus, Acfinoptychus, etc. The 

 various forms were arranged in a line on a square cover-glass, 

 supported on the slide by bands of cement at two opposite edges, 

 thus permitting fluids of varying refractive indices to be passed 

 under the cover and withdrawn by the use of blotting paper in the 

 manner familiarly known as ' ' irrigation. " 



The fluids employed consisted of absolute alcohol, cedar oil, oil 

 of cassia and mixtures of same, giving refractive indices from 

 about 1.37 to over 1.60. Starting with the lowest refractive 

 index, the appearance of each diatom was carefully noted under 

 low, medium and high aperture objectives, and it was found that 

 all the species represented, with the exception of the two Aulaco- 

 discii, became fainter as the refractive index was increased up to 

 about 1.435, when they were entirely invisible, except where in 

 contact with the cover glass. As the index of the medmm sur- 

 rounding them was increased above this point thej became more 

 distinct, the coarser forms being almost opaque in oil of cassia. 

 This is exactly what should have been expected, either on theo- 

 retical grounds or based on previously published experiments, but 

 in the case of the two species of Aulacodmus mentioned the 

 distinctness of visibility under a low power seemed to increase from 

 the start, and in the medium where other forms disappeared they 

 were even more strongly outlined than in alcohol, while under an 

 oil immersion-objective no difference could be noted in the sharpness 

 and contrast with which the secondary structure was shown iu any 

 of the various fluids, although portions of the internal plates, which 

 extended beyond the external plate in broken forms, were extin- 

 guished with the rest of the diatoms on the slide, showing that the 

 anomalous Ijehavior of these swcies was confined to the external 

 plate, containing the secondary structure. Neither heating to 

 redness on platinum foil nor boiling in strong acids has the least 

 ettect on the appearance of the secondary structure, nor is there 

 anything to indicate that its appearance is due to ditterence in 

 composition rather than of structure. With the facts at present 

 available it would he useless to hazard a conjecture as to the true 

 nature of this structure, but it may be safely affirmed that iu the 

 external plate of this group of species of AulacodUcus we have a 

 structure esseutiallv dittfereut from that found among other diatoms. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 323 



Aulacodisciis Orerjanus is one of the few diatoms that show brio-ht 

 colors with central transmitted light. The two valves of tliis 

 species included on slide under observation, when examined with a 

 three-fourths-inch objective of .25 N.A., were bronze-vellow when 

 dry, yellowish gray in alcohol, bluish gray in medium of 1.41 

 E.I., iridescent blue in medium of 1.44 R.I., deep greenish blue in 

 cedar oil, dark green and pink in oil of cassia. 



The question of colors shown by diatoms in direct light has 

 recently been treated in the Journalofthe Queckett Club, with special 

 reference to Actinocydus Ealfsii, by E. M. Nelson, who has shown 

 that the co]or_ cannot be due to diffraction. The two valves of 

 A. Ralfsii which were included in the previously described shde 

 showed only pale brown and grayish tints in media of R.I. below 

 1.50, and extinguished with the other forms in one of R.I. about 

 1.43. In cedar oil one valve showed a blue color and in oil of 

 cassia both became brilliant with green, blue, purple and yellow. 

 Under wide aperture objectives the color is not visible when diatom 

 is sharply in focus, but appears as soon as thrown slightly out of 

 focus. This color appeai-s to be due to dispersion, and its nature 

 and cause might possibly be further elucidated by studying the 

 effect produced by different media such as were employed in this 

 case.

FISHES FROM CAROLINE ISLAND. 



BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



In the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia for 1890, pp. 482 to 496, the writer has wrongly 

 ascribed to the Caroline Islands a collection of fishes the Academy 

 had lately received. 



The erfor was due in part to the similarity of names and in part 

 to confusion of label?. 



The Caroline Islands, sometimes called New Philippines, com- 

 prise the greater part of Micronesia, and are entirely different 

 and remote from the Caroline Island. Caroline or Thornton 

 Island is a group of low coral islands on a single reef seven 

 miles long and one mile wide, situated in Lat. 10° 0' 01" S., Long. 

 150° 14' 30" W. 



Since the collection referred to came into tlie Academy's posses- 

 sion, others from the estate of Prof. E. D. Cope have been re- 

 ceive<l. Among these were a few fishes from Caroline Island, none 

 of which are recorded in tlie preceding paper. To Dr. H. A. Pils- 

 bry, who has examined these later collections, I am indebted for 

 more complete and precise data. 



He states that the collections were made by Mr. C. D. Voy, 

 who was an enthusiastic collector residing in California a. number 

 of years ago. He accumulated private collections, of which he 

 disposed, using the proceeds to make an expedition across the 

 Pacific to New Zealand. Upon this expedition he visited the Sand- 

 wich Islands and several of the islands of the south seas, among 

 them Caroline Islaad, where all the fishes were collected. At least 

 the Academy has not received any from other localities visited 

 on this expedition. IIow Prof. Cope obtained the collection I 

 do not know.

TYPES OF FISHES. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



The history of the Academy's collection of fishes, like that of 

 others in possession of the Society, begins with contributions during 

 the early days of its existence. These contributions were at firs^ 

 mainly small donations from members and others, the number 

 gradually increasing by additions from special regions. In 1868 

 we find that owing to the then greatly increased size of this depart- 

 ment of ihe museum, a joint report of a Committee on herpetology 

 and ichthyology was printed. Exploration of different parts 

 of America then furnished the Academy with many of the most 

 valuable additions. Accessions were received from Dr. J. K. 

 Townsend, Prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte, Drs. W. O. Ayres,

 tion, Prof. E. D. Cope, and the United States Fish Commission. 

 Many other collections of greater or less size were also received, 

 but as tlie writer wishes to call attention to only a few of the more 

 important reference to them may be omitted. Jfost of these have 

 been treated of fully or in part in the publications of the Academy 

 or other American journals. 



The collection of Prince C. L. Bonaparte was purchased and 

 presented by Dr. Thomas B. Wilson, who was also a generous con- 

 tributor to many other departments of the Aeademy. This collec- 

 tion, consisting for the most part of Italian fishes, contained all 

 the species figured and described in the Fauna Italica, must of 

 which are still well preserved. The greater part of I his collection 

 consisted of alcoholics, though there were 177 examples of dried 

 skins. 



Mr. Ashmead's collections were mostly local, like those of Dr. 

 Abbott, who published a number of his observations. Dr. Ayres 




328 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



made collections principally in California, Dr. Hammond in Kan- 

 sas and Mr. Powel in Rhode Island. In the West Indies Dr. Van 

 Rijgersma collected at St. JNIartins, Dr. Griffith in St. Croix and 

 Dr. H. C. Wood in New Providence. Dr. Hering collected fishes 

 in Surinam and Dr. Ruschenberger at Rio Janeiro and various 

 other localities. j\Iany of the most valuable additions were pre- 

 sented by the Smithsonian Institution, among which are a series 

 of typical examples, mostly Catostomidae and Cypriuidae. The 

 explorations in the west and southwestern regions of the United 

 States secured many novelties described by Dr. Charles Girard and 

 Prof. S. F. Baird. 



The most extensive and numerous contributions are due to the 

 exertions of Prof. E. D. Cope. Collections from the Kanawha, 

 Holston and Roanoke rivers included large series of species with 

 many types. His entire alcoholic collection was bequeathed to the 

 Academy, including many fresh-water fishes from tlie upper 

 Amazons, made by Prof. James Orton and John Hauxwell. 



The fishes obtained in the province of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 

 should be mentioned, as they are the basis of Cope's last im- 

 portant contribution to South American ichthyology. His other 

 noteworthy collections are from Pennsylvania, North Carolina, 

 Texas and Florida. 



In the present paper it is intended only to treat of the Marsi- 

 pobranchii, Selachii and Ganoidei, and it is believed that refer- 

 ences to all the typical representatives of these groups that are pre- 

 served iu the collections are included. 



I have appended rather rough descriptions of the alimentary or 

 enteric caual to most of the species fit for dissection, which are 

 represented by duplicates. 



To the authorities of the Academy I am much indebted for per- 

 mission to make these dissections from duplicate specimens.

Mouth. — Moderately large, somewhat spacious and compressed. 

 The jaws alone are furnished with teeth. Tongue a little free in 

 front, broad and flat, though somewhat rounded anteriorly. The 

 inside of the mouth is lined with smooth integument altogether 

 destitute of shagreen. 



Pharynx. — Spacious, elongate and compressed. Upon the walls 

 of the branchial arches are patches of fine shagreen, otherwise the 

 rest of the integument lining this region is perfectly smooth. 

 There are 5 gill-openings within the pharynx, which lead into as 

 maay gill-pouches, and finally communicate externally by as many 

 gill-slits. Of the internal gill-openings, which are greater than 

 those which are external, the anterior is the largest, and they all 

 gradually diminish in length until the last, which is not more 

 than \ the fength of the first. The gill-pouches contain the gill- 

 filaments, aud they are separated from each other by mean.s of 

 inter-branchial septa. The gill-filaments are distributed in each 

 gill-pouch, so as to appear continuous, except in the last, where 

 they are only upon the anterior walls. They are of moderate 

 number, compressed, and adnate, except distally, to the walls of 

 the gill-pouches. There is a well-developed spiracle aperture 

 within the pharyu.x, anterior aud superior to the first gill-opening. 

 It is furnished with pseudobrancliiai. 



CEiophagm. — Short and somewhat constricted. The walls more 

 or less plicate. 



Stomach. — Spacious and bulky, and the walls greatly plicated, 

 except in the pyloric region. The tissues of this division of the 

 enteric canal are tiiicker than any other. 



Iiitedi'ie. — The duodenum is very short, existing as a simple 

 tube greaty constricted, until the presence of the colon is indicated

by the spiral valve. The diameter of the colon is much greater 

 than any other division of the intestine, and posteriorly its boun- 

 daries are fixed by the terminus of the spiral valve, and the last 

 division of the intestine is formed. This is the rectum. It is of 

 more constricted dimensions than the colon, persisting as a short 

 .simple tube to the cloaca, into which its contents are conveyed by 

 means of the rectal aperture. There is a rectal gland which is 

 confluent with the rectum. 



Liver. — Large and bulky, the left lobe greatly exceeding the 

 right in dimensions. 



Spleen. — Present in the usual position. 



Pancreas. — Developed.

 the branchial arches ai'e roughened and also the floor of the 

 pharynx. Gill-openings 5 within the pharynx, whicli lead into as 

 many gill-pouches, and finally communicate externally by as many 

 giU-slits. The internal gill-openings, in fact the entire branchial 

 system, resembles that of Prlitlurus meladomus so far as ob-

 short. 



Intestine. — Duodenum short. Colon large and very bulky, 

 especially its median portion, and furnished with a spii-al valve. 

 The rectum short and simple, terminating in the cloaca. A rectal 

 gland is developed which is confluent with the rectum.

Body elongate, slender, and tapering much after the first D., 

 where the greatest depth is located. Head large, with a flattened 

 snout which is pointed. The interorbital space is broad, broader 

 than the snout. Eye of moderate size, lateral, and its anterior 

 margin over the tip of the mandible. Posterior to the eye and 

 very near its posterior edge is the spiracle which is furnished with 

 small pseudo bran chine. The nostrils are each furnished with a flap. 



The snout anterior to the mouth is greater than the space between 

 the external borders of the nostrils, and it is also greater than the 

 width between the external corners of the mouth. The teeth are 

 smooth, rounded and rhombic. Mouth furnished with a broad 

 flattened tongue, and there are also two entire buccal flaps at the 

 bases of the jaws. Gill-slits 5, about equal, and the last above 

 the base of the P. Origin of the first D. about over the middle 

 of the P. The fin itself is large, and its base is greater than its 

 height. It has a posterior projection, the tip of wliich seems to 

 me to be slightly in advance of the origin of the V. The origin 

 of the second D. is much in advance of that of the A., and its 

 posterior base is about over the last third of the base of the A. 

 The base of the second D. is much greater than the height of the 

 fin, and it is also furnished with a posterior projection which is 

 attenuated. The middle of the first D. is about midway between 

 the posterior root of P. and anterior root of the V. The P. very 

 broad, and flattened. The space between the inner edges of the 

 bases of the P. less than the width of the mouth. The V. broad 

 and blunt, and without inner posterior projections. Tlie A. is very 

 small and ■with a sharp posterior projection. Caudal notched. 

 Lateral line present, its course somewhat deeurved posteriorly in 

 the region of the second D. 



The coloration is not entirely uniform as described liy Prof. Cope. 

 The general color of the body is a leaden -brown, somewhat 

 darker dorsally. There are several bands of dark blackish-brown-

upou the upper anterior portion of the body. These are about 

 6 in number, and the two behind the eye, and over the anterior 

 gill-slits, are the most distinct. Below light brownish, with a pale 

 buff or ochraceous tinge.

 of asperities. The apertures of spiracles are placed superior and 

 anterior to the first gill-opening. The gill-opening are 5 in num- 

 ber, the first the largest and the others gradually decreasing in size 

 until the last, which is the smallest or shortest. They all commu- 

 nicate with the branchial chamber, forming 4 separate or free 

 branchial arches and one adnate to the posterior part of the 

 pharynx. The four free branchial arches are furnished with the 

 usual complement of gill-filaments, distributed along their outer 

 edges. No gill -filaments upon the last branchial arch. Upon the 

 inner anterior and posterior edges of the branchial arches are short, 

 fleshy, filamentous gill rakers. They are not very numerous, not 

 J the length of the longest giU-filaments, aud longest medianly. 

 The branchial arches themselves seem rather broad. 



CEsophagus. — The enteric canal is now somewhat consiricted, 

 persisting posteriorly until under the posterior portion of the air- 

 bladder, when it turns and is produced anteriorly until posterior to 

 the pericardial cavity. Here it forms a somewhat exaggerated 

 coudifion known as the stomach. 



The oesophagus is connected by a large tube, though short, with 

 the air-bladder. This is placed a short distance fi-om the pharj'nx 

 and upon the first or upper division of the oesophagus. 



Stomach. — Rather small and apparently not very capacious or 

 distensible. The walls are considerably thickened, the tissue being 

 muscular. After this the pyloric region is marked by a large, 

 compressed and rounded sac, which is nearly as large as the stomach 

 itself. 



Intestine. — -The duodenum persists first posteriorly, then runs 

 forward a short distance, after which the colon is formed. Its 

 walls are porous and not muscular. 



The colon is furnished with a spiral valve aud no rectal gland is 

 present. The rectum is well developed. 



Liver. — Large, anterior aud superior, and bilobed. 



Ryder' says under Acipenmr brevirostris Le Sueur: "How 

 much more extensive than the Delaware River its range may be 1

have uo ineans of knowing, as I have found only one specimen, 

 besides the five obtained by myself at Delaware City, which can be 

 regarded as an authentic example of the species. This single 

 specimen is in the museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, and consists of a dried and stuffed varnished skin 

 marked in white paint ' 84.' It agrees in every essential external 

 particular with my own alcoholic specimens, but no record of its his- 

 tory is accessible amongst the catalogues of the collections of that 

 institution ; all traces of the old manuscript catalogues of the 

 Bonaparte and the other old collections of fishes belonging to the 

 Academy's museum having been lost. I have, however, the strongest 

 suspicion that this specimen, which is evidently very old, judging 

 from its present condition, may be one of the originals of 

 Le Sueur's description published in the Transactions of the Ameri- 

 can Philosophical Society for 1818, though it does not correspond 

 in minor details. That it may possibly be one of the types of the 

 species seems to me not at all improbable, from the fact that 

 Le Sueur was also one of the early members of the Academy and 

 may have presented the specimen." 



I have not been able to find this specimen, and so far as I know 

 the only specimen from Le Sueur's collection at present in the 

 Academy is his Cijprinus maxillingua. Many of the typical speci- 

 mens he described were in the old Philadelphia Museum, and after 

 its dissolution they may have been destroyed in the conflagration of 

 P. T. Barnum, who purchased part of the natuial history material.

 presented by him to the Academy. 



The species was heretofore known only from five examples — Ihe 

 type secured at Anderson, S. C. ; one obtained by Dr. Joseph 

 Leidv, at Jackson, N. J., July 1860 ; one from May's Landing, 

 N. j'., J. E. Peters, June 1, 1888, and two from Pleasant JNIilfs,

Mr. Stone stated that, though probably of restricted distribu- 

 tion, the species would no doubt prove more abundant if specially 

 sought for, the comparative remoteness of the New Jersey barrens, 

 where most of the specimens were found, and the retiring habits 

 of the animal both tending to make its detection difficult. 



A few months since he had heard some tree frogs in a swamp 

 near Medford, N. J., whose call was difl^erent from that of any 

 other species with which he was acquainted, and he was inclined 

 to attribute it to the present form; diligent search, however, failed 

 to discover the animals.

NEW LAND MOLLTJSCA FKOM JAPAN AND THE LOO CHOO ISLANDS. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The collectors sent out by Mr. Hirase in the early months of this 

 j'ear have already transmitted much new and valuable material, 

 in the study of which it is my privilege to assist. As i\Ir. Hirase 

 desires to supply such species as have been collected in copious 

 quantity to his correspondents in America and Europe, the prompt 

 publication of full descriptions of the novelties is necessary to 

 avoid the inconvenience attending the publicity of manuscript- 

 names. The full report, with figures of the new forms, may best 

 be deferred. until the results of the season's collecting can be pre- 

 sented in connected form. Most of the following species are from 

 Kunchan, the northern and least setiled province of the island 

 Okinawa, or Great Luchu (Loo Choc), and from Oshima, hitherto 

 unexplored for land mollusks. 

 Trochomorpha horiomphala (Pfr.). 



Specimens have been sent by Mr. Hirase (No. 631) from Kun- 

 chan, the northern province of Okinawa. They are more depressed 

 than Pfeiffer's type, but there is considerable variation in the 

 species in this respect. Trochomorpha Fritzei Bttg. is a synonym. 

 No definite locality has been known hitherto for Pfeiffer's species, 

 which, moreover, has been lost, so to speak, in the group Flecto- 

 tropis. It was doubtless this error of classification which led 

 Boettger to redescribe the shell as T. Fritzei. 

 Trochomorpha Gouldiana n. sp. 



Shell low-conic above, convex beneath, umbilicate, the umbilicus 

 one- fourth the diameter of the shell, broadly open to the apex ; of 

 a dark reddish brown color, glossy ; delicately striate, the stria; cut 

 into minute granules by finer, very shallow spiral striae, both 

 above and below. Spire straightly conic, the apex slightly ob- 

 tuse. Whorls (H, slowly widening, slightly convex below, and 

 slightly concave above each suture; the last whorl acutely carinate, 

 concave above and below the keel; base convex in the middle, 



1 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. .345 



the margin of the umbilicus abrupt but not keeled. Aperture small, 

 rhombic, the peristome simple, obtuse and whitish in fully adult 

 specimens. Alt. 5.3, diam. 12.7 mm 



Oshima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 650). 



This species differs widely from T. eathcartce, (Eve. ) and T. horl- 

 omphala (Pfr. ), the two species known from the Loo Choo group, 

 in its higher spire and less spreading form. It is closely related 

 to T. Shermani (Pfr.) of Formosa, but differs in being smaller, 

 with straightly conic spire, the whorls concave above keel and 

 suture, and the aperture narrower, less rounded below. 



It is named in honor of Dr. A. A. Gould, who described the 

 Japanese shells collected by the Ringgold and Rogers Expedition. 

 I find two specimens in the collection of the Academy, labeled 

 " H. horiomphala, Pfr. Oosima." 



Maorochlamys perfragilis n. sp. 



Shell perforate, depressed, excessively thin, transparent, pale 

 yellow, fragile. Surface brilliantly glossy, with faint growth-lines 

 and almost obsolete, scarcely perceptible spiral strite. Spire low- 

 conic. Whorls Ah, somewhat convex, rather slowly widening, 

 separated by a narrowly margined suture, the last whorl much 

 wider, rounded at the periphery, rather convex beneath, narrowly 

 impressed around the perforation. Aperture very broadly lunale, 

 somewhat oblique, the lip fragile, columellar margin with, a short, 

 triangular reflection partially concealing the perforation. 



Alt. 10, greater diam. 18, lesser 15 mm. 



Alt. 8i, greater diam. 16, lesser 14i mm. 



Kunchan, Okinawa (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 637). 



A capacious, very fragile species, somewhat like M. Stearnsi Pils. 

 of China, and quite different from anything yet described from 

 Japan or the Loo Choo group. 



MacTochlamys Gudei n. sp. 



Shell minutely perforate, depressed-conoidal, thin, somewhat 

 translucent, corneous-brown. Surface glossy, sculptured with 

 weak growth-wrinkles, and on the base some coarse but shallow 

 and inconspicuous spiral sulci, obsolete in places. Spire conic; 

 whorls 6f , rather strongly convex, slowly widening, the last wider, 

 subangular at the periphery, the angle obvious in front, but dis- 

 appearing near the aperture. Base convex, sunken around the 




346 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



perforation. Aperture luaate, the lip simple and thiu, columellar 

 margin hardly thickened, dilated above, a triangular reflection 

 partially covering the perforation. 



Alt. 7, diam. 10 mm. 



Kunchan, Okinawa (Mr. Y. Hirase, Xo. 635). 



This species has about the size, form and appearance of the 

 American Gastrodonta ligera (Say), though the whorls are more 

 convex and less striate above, and there is, of course, no callus 

 lining the basal part of the interior. The generic position assigned 

 is somewhat doubtful. 



It is named in honor of my friend G. K. Gude, who has pro- 

 duced several meritorious papers upon Japanese land snails. 



Ealiella borealis n. sp. 



Shell minutely perforate, pyramidal with shghtlj^ convex lateral 

 outlines and flattened base, thin, corneous-brown. Sui'face some- 

 what shining, sculptured above with regularly spaced, verj' delicate 

 whitish hair-like strire, the base showing fine spiral striie, aud ex- 

 cept near the periphery, minutely but rather roughly pitted. 

 Whorls 7, nearly flat, the suture but slightly impressed, narrowly 

 margined; the last whorl acutely carinate. Aperture rhombic, the 

 peristome thiu and fragile, columellar margin abruptly dilated and 

 reflexed partly over the perforation. 



Alt. 3J, diam. 3J mm. 



Kayabe, Ojima, Hokkaido Island (^Jlr. Y. Hirase, Xo. 641). 



A rather straightly pyramidal species, distinct from any of the 

 numerous species known to me from Hondo. 



Eulota (Eahadra) oshimae n. sp. 



Shell globose-subdepressed, umbilicate, rather thin but solid, of 

 a rich reddish chestnut color, darker within the umbilicus and on 

 the back of the lip, and with a very dark chestnut, almost black 

 baud just above the periphery, bordered above and below with 

 greenish-yellow bands : the convexity of the base sometimes fading 

 to the same pale tini. Surface rather glossy, but in part dull, 

 sculptured with slight growth-strire only ; several inner whorls, 

 after the apical one, minutely wrinkled and marked with points iu 

 oblique lines. Spire conic, more or less elevated. Whorls varying 

 from 6;f in large to 5f in small specimens, quite convex, slowly 

 widening, the last rounded at the periphery, very slightly and 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 347 



slowly descendiug in front, convex beneath. Aperture broadly 

 lunate, slightly oblique, bluish and showing the band inside ; peris- 

 tome expanded and rather narrowly reflexed, thickened within, 

 purple, with 'the extreme edge pale ; columellar margin broadly 

 dilated, very dark, half covering the umbilicus.

Oshima," (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 357). 



This magnificent species is related to both E. caliginosa^ aud E. 

 mercatoria,"' but is more globose than either, with more convex 

 whorls. It differs conspicuously from E. caliginosa in having the 

 base of the shell and aperture rounded, not conspicuously flattened, 

 as they are in caliginosa. The basal lip, moreover, is not sinuous. 

 E. oshimoe resembles E. mercatoria in the form of the aperture, 

 but differs in being more globose, with a larger umbilicus in shells 

 of the same size, aud the whorls are more convex. 



The variation in size, as shown by the above measurements, is 

 extraordinary, but there seems to be a complete series of interme- 

 diate specimens. The smaller shells are those most resembling E. 

 mercatoria. E. oshimce is thus related to species of Okinawa, and 

 not to the luchuana group of Japan proper. 



Chlorites euoharistus n. sp. 



Shell umbilicate, thin, concave above, of a rich, dark chestnut 

 color. Densely hairy, the hairs loug, regularly arranged in 

 diagonal lines descending forwardly aud backward, the surface 

 between them minutely papillose. Whorls 4i, the earlier ones 

 forming a rather deeply sunken spire, the last third of the last 

 whorl deeply descending to the periphery, the whorl preceding this 

 coiled in a plane. The first whorl is glossy and smooth; the last 

 whorl widens toward the aperture, aud is obscurely gibbous aud 

 then contracted behind the lip; the base convex, having a small 

 excavation behind the basal lip, producing a low prominence just 

 within the basal margin of the aperture. Aperture very oblique,

348 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



very broadly lunate; peristome rather narrowly reflexed, purple, 

 the margins somewhat approaching, connected across the parietal 

 wall by a slender, raised cord. 



Alt. 9, greater diam. 19, lesser 15i mm. 



Alt. 9^, greater diam. 18, lesser 15 mm. 



Alt. 7J, greater diam. 15, lesser 12 mm. (small form). 



Oshima, ^Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 354). 



This fine species has the sunken spire of the typical forms of the 

 genus from the JMolucoas, etc. It is a larger and much finer species 

 than the two hitherto described from Japan, C. oscitam (^lartens) 

 and C. Jragilis Gude, neither of which has the well-developed per- 

 istome of G. eucharistus. Three of the .specimens sent are of 

 about the same size, but another is conspicuously smaller, with the 

 spire perceptibly more sunken, and the low "tooth" within the 

 basal margin of the peristome is subobsolete. 



Suooinea Hirasei u. sp. 



A species grouping with S. pfeifferi of Europe and S. retusa of 

 America. Elongate, fragile, reddish or corneous, amber-colored, 

 composed of 2|- very rapidly enlarging whorls, the last one very 

 large, roughened by rather coarse growth-wriukies. A))erture long- 

 ovate, somewhat effuse below, the margins regularly arcuate. 



Length 16, diam. 9, longest axis of aperture 13, width 6J mm. 



Tsuchiura, Hitachi, in eastern Hondo (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 

 642). 



Both of the Succineas previously known from Japan, S. lauta 

 Gld. and S. horticola Eeinh., belong to the group of species having 

 very convex whorls, like S. putris or S. obliqua. This new one 

 goes with the lengthened species, and is very like S. retusa Lea 

 {ovalis Gld.), but the Japanese form is rather less effuse than the 

 American. 



Cyolophorus Hirasei "■ sp- 



Shell narrowly umbilicate, turbinate, with elevated spire, solid ; 

 greenish yellow, with a rather wide black belt just below the peri- 

 phery, which is marked with a pale belt, and several dark lines 

 and bands beneath, more or less interrupted at short intervals; the 

 upper surface marked with numerous dark bands, interrupted 

 obliquely or in zigzag fashion; the bands retaining their distinct- 

 ness or more or less confluent into zigzag stripes. Whorls 5i to 



1 



I 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 349 



Dearly 6, very convex, the last flattened below the suture, else- 

 where well rounded. Aperture circular, somewhat oblique, bluish 

 and showing the bands inside; peristome ralher narrowly reflesed, 

 its face rounded, faintly red-tinted or bright red, continued ;ii a 

 callus across the very short parietal wall; the columellar margin 

 overhanging and partially concealing the small umbilicus. 



Alt. 30, diam. 32 mm. ; autero-posterior diameter of ajjerture 

 21, width 19^ mm. 



Alt. 29, diam. 31 mm. ; antero-posterior diameter of aperture 

 20i, width 19 mm. 



Operculum circular, multispiral, concave externally; diam. 

 1.5i mm. 



Oshima, (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 644). 



Related to C. jourdyi Mori., fulguratus Pfr., courbeii Anc, and 

 their allies, species of Tonquin and Burma. It is remarkable for 

 its elevated spire and brilliant peristome. 

 Pupinella oshimae n. sp. 



Shell pupiform, dark purplish brown under a papery whitish outer 

 color, api«rently the result of weathering, densely and finely striate 

 when unworn. Whorls 6, slightly convex, the first four forming 

 a conic spire, the penultimate and last whorls of about equal diam- 

 eter ; last whorl somewhat ])roduced forward below. Aperture 

 vertical, the opening small and circular; peristome broadly reflexed, 

 white or nearly so, very heavily thickened on the face, produced 

 forward in a flange around the opening, iuterrupteil by minute 

 channels at the base of the columella and posterior end of the lip, 

 these channels expanding funnel -like outwardly; parietal callus 

 very strong at its right end, emitting a branch which rises high 

 above the termination of the outer lip. 



Length 10, diam. 4.8 mm.; diam. of aperture, inside of peris- 

 tome, 2.2 mm. 



Oshima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 64.5). 



This species differs strongly from jP. rufa Sowb. and its slierhtly 

 differentiated local forms fnihstorferi and tsushimana, in the rela- 

 tively enormous development of the peristome, reducing the open- 

 ing of the aperture; in the vertical, not oblique plane of the aper- 

 ture, and especially in having the tongue of the parietal callus 

 defining the posterior canal, very much longer, rising high above 

 the termination of the outer lip. The latter is abruptly truncated 




350 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



on a level with the suture, not produced upward, as in the otner 

 species mentioned. The upper foramen of the lip shows from in 

 front as a slit, not an orifice, as in P. rufa. 



P. fruhstorferi and fsushimcuia, from Iki Island and Tsushima 

 respectively, are hardly distinguishable from rufa. With a series 

 of P. rufa before me from Kobe, Awaji, Hyuga province in 

 Kiushiu, and other localities, and specimens of fruhstorferi and 

 tsiishimana MUdtf. received from Fruhstofer, 1 am unable to find 

 any differential characters for Dr. von Mollendorff s sup]30sed spe- 

 cies and subspecies except their distribution. The deeply dissected 

 western coast of Kiushiu indicates subsidence of an area long ex- 

 posed to denudation, and points to the recent isolati(m of Tsushima 

 and neighboi'ing islands. Their fauna has much in common with 

 Kiusiiiu, and, so far as we now know, but few special species 

 strongly differentiated from those of the greater island. 



DIPLOM M ATINID^. 



The Japanese Diplommatinidcc fall into three groups : D. 

 pusilla V. Mart, and its var. omiensis Pils. are sinistral forms, 

 pusilla being placed in the genus Palaina, subgenus Cylin- 

 dropalaina by Kobelt and Mollendorff;' but their genera Palaina 

 and Diplommatina seem to stand in need of some rearrangement, 

 judging by the lists of species. 



All of the other Japanese species apparently belong to the sec- 

 tion Sinica of the genus Dipjlommatina, with the single exception 

 of D. Uirris, which diffei's strongly from all other known Japanese 

 species. 



Diplommatina turns n- sp. 



8hell minute, tapering-turreted, whitish; the last two whorls of 

 about equal diameter, those above slowly tapering. Whorls 1^ 

 to 8, extremely convex, the first two smooth, the apex obtuse; the 

 last whorl but slightly ascending in front. Surface regularly soulp- 

 tured with rather widely spaced thread-like rib-strice. Aperture 

 subcircular, the columellar tooth hardly visible from in front, but 

 seen in aa oblique view in the aperture to be moderately strong; 

 peristome narrowly expanded, its inner edge built forward beyond

the expausion; continued in an adnata callus aci'oss the parietal 

 wall. Palatal fold short, to the left of the parietal callus. 



Length 2.2, diam. 0.9 mm. 



Oshima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 648). 



This species is not related to any other form known from Japan 

 or the Loo Choo group. The turreted shape, extremely convex 

 whorls, and regular spaced rib-strire are its prominent features. 



Diplommatina saginata n. sp. 



Shell dextral, imperforate, shortly oblong-conic, obese, amber- 

 colored or white, densely sculptured with delicate thread-like rib- 

 striae, about 25 in the space of a millimeter on the penultimate 

 whorl, slightly wider apart on the earlier whorls; no spiral stria- 

 tion. Penultimate whorl widest, those above forming a regularly 

 conic spire. Whorls 6^, the first obtuse and smooth; last whorl 

 much smaller than the penultimate, strongly ascending in front. 

 Aperture subcircular; columellar tooth strong, as usual. Peris- 

 tome narrowly reflexed, thickened on the face, continuous in a 

 delicate cord across the parietal margin. Palatal fold above the 

 columella, rather long. 



Length 2.3, diam. 1.2 mm. 



Nase, Oshima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 6496) ; also Furuniga, 

 Oshima (No. 649a). 



A smaller, shorter species than D. insularum of Kunchan, 

 Okinawa, or D. casm of Hondo. In one specimen the outer lip 

 is duphcate, in the others merely thickened. The upper margin of 

 the peristome rises nearly to the preceding suture. A specimen 

 from Furuniya measures, length 2.24, diam. 1.28 mm. 



Diplommatina oshimse n. sp. 



Shell dextral, imperforate, bright red -amber colored, the penulti- 

 mate whorl widest, those above regularly tapering, forming a long, 

 attenuated spire, ^^'^horls 7, convex, the first two or three dark 

 red, smooth, the next two Waving conspicuous thread-like, xvide- 

 spaced rihlets, the last two whorls densely sculptured with low, more 

 delicate rib-striije; the last whorl somewhat contracted, ascending 

 in front, gibbous on the base behind the columellar lip. Aperture 

 circular, the peristome reflexed, not doubled, its inner edge a little 

 thickened and built forward, scarcely continuous, the parietal callus 




352 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Juiie, 



being but slightly developed. Coluraellar tooth strong, as usual. 

 Palatal fold wanting. 



Length 3, diam. 1.4 mm. 



Oshima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 651). 



This species has a longer, more attenuated spire than D. 

 luchuana, and it differs from that and all other described Japanese 

 species in the widely spaced riblets of the spire. Moreover, no 

 palatal fold is seen through the front of the whorl, and upon ojieu- 

 ing a specimen I found it wanting. 



Diplommatina luchuana u. sp.

 are present in var. omiensis, as well as in what I take to be typical

 The Bending of Mature Wood in Trees. 

 At the meeting of the American Association for the Advance- 

 ment of Science held in Philadelphia iu 1884, Prof. Charles E. 

 Bessey exhibited a drawing of the trunk of a Balsam Fir that had 

 blown over and had bent in such a manner that the curvature could 

 only have occurred after the trunk had become several years old. 

 The prevalent impression is that trees and branches grow into their 

 various forms; or, as the popular phrase expresses it, " as the twig 

 is bent the tree's inclined." No one was prepared to believe that 

 the tree, once inclined, could at any time thereafter change its 

 form. There was nothing in the text-books to indicate the possi- 

 bility of such phenomena. Prof. Bessey's specimen was looked 

 upon as interesting and curious, but it has had no influence in 

 our text-book teachings. Up to the present time we are taught 

 to look to light, gravitation, tension, turgescence, or some one or 

 another of the surrounding conditions to account for the direc- 

 tion which stems or branches assume— the independent energy 

 developed from plant life itself receiving but slight recognition, 

 probably because its exact nature is so far incomprehensible. 

 Prof. Bessey's experience seemed to throw more light on some 

 of my own observations. In the Proceedings of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for 1866, p. 401, appears 

 my paper " On the Consumption of Force by Plants in Over- 

 coming C4ravitation," in which is clearly shown that life-energy, 

 sustained by nutrition, was an enormous power in the life- 

 history of the plant. I was encouraged to make actual experi- 

 ments and wide observations, that have extended from that lime 

 till now, only to find the surprising fact that the recurving and 

 incurving of mature growth is among the commonest of phenomena 

 in the vegetable world. Before proceeding to prepare tiiis paper, 

 I inquired of Prof. Bessey if he had investigated the matter fur- 

 ther, and received the following interesting letter: 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3.55 



"LiNxoLX, Xeb., Dec. 29, 1900. 

 "My Dear Professor Meehan .—In regard to the bendino- of the 

 mature mternodes of conifers, I may say that it was in 1884 that I 

 made the hrst pubhc statement before the Botanical Club of the 

 A. A. A. fc,., or possibly before the Biological Section itself. It was 

 to the ettect that in the spring of the year 1882 Texactlv April 8) a 

 tornado crossed the campus of the Agricultural College at Ame« 

 la , and among other things which it did, it partly uprooted "a 

 number of conifers, bendin- them over almost to the grouud in 

 some cases. After a while I noticed that these trees were bendino- 

 upward and that the bending was not confined to the voungest 

 luternodes, but that the older internodes were more or less bent 

 also. 1 noticed this particularly in the case of some Balsam Fir 

 trees, Abies balsamea, in which the bending extended several years 

 f.^r?- ^'™® "^^^^ ^''^ -^^^^^ ^^^''e first partly uprooted " 



This year (in August) I had the opportunity of noticing the 

 same thing in connection with the Foxtail Pine, Plnus flexilis 

 van Murrayana, in the Yellowstone Park A slender tree had 

 been bent to the ground by the fall of a larger tree, and vet the 

 smaller tree had been able to bend a considerable portion of its 

 top so as to bring it approximately erect. A careful examination 

 of the larger tree in regard to the time of its fall made it certain 

 that several of the mature internodes of the smaller tree bent 

 after reaching the horizontal position. I have .seen something, 

 like this in case of the destruction of the central ' leader ' of the 

 Austrian Pines on the University campus, during the past ten or 

 twelve years, but these cases are not as striking as those cited 

 above. ^.n^u 



" I am glad that you are to bring this out, as I know that it 

 uilJ be so done that there will be no doubc at all in regard to it. 



" I am very truly, etc., 



"Charles E. Bessey." 



My own work began by inclining an Arbor Vita3, Thuja occiden- 

 talu, to an angle of about 45°. It was about eight feet hi^h and 

 perfectly straight. About the middle of May the followincr year 

 the apex began to curve upwardly. The process continued" for 

 about three weeks, by which time the curving had extended down 

 to some three feet, reaching the five-year-old wood of the main 

 stem. In the course of this process the upper portion, that had 

 commenced the incurving motion, would again become erect, so 

 that the curve would only occupy a few feet in extent in the re-ion 

 of the three to five-year-old wood. The upper or erect portion 

 would, however, be considerably out of line with the perpendicular 




356 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



of the tree's original growth from the ground. The following 

 year the incurve extended down to the six or seven-year wood, 

 and the upper portion recurved so that it might again assume a 

 perpendicular position. No further curving occurred in after 

 years. The tree is yei one of the curiosities on my grounds. 



Following this was an experiment with a Lawson Cypress, 

 Ciipr&ssus Lawsoniana. The results were similar, the incurving 

 being just after active growth in spring. 



So far we have the lesson from direct experiment. But when 

 we look around us we see the bending power abundantly illus- 

 trated. The Galena Weeping Elm, a form of Ulmus Americana, 

 grafted on stems eight or ten feet high, starts from the first with 

 cord-like pendent branches reaching to the ground. But I have 

 trees between thirty and forty years old that are nearly as many 

 feet high. I have never seen an erect one-year-old branch on the 

 trees. At the end of every branch there is pendent a growth of 

 two or three years. For several years I have watched u leading 

 branch that is straight and nearly horizontal, now over twenty feet 

 in length ; a pendent growth of three years is always at its termi- 

 nus. I find that in June the third year's growth straightens, the 

 new growth still forming a continuous three-year bend. The Weep- 

 ing Willow will occasionally make a few vigorous straight stems to 

 aid in the upward growth, but the majority of the curved 

 branches take to straightening after two or three years. The 

 Hemlock Spruce, Abies canadensis, curves its new growth, which 

 continues curved till the next season, when it rapidly becomes 

 erect, the new growth taking the curve of the previous year. 



The most interesting features of the study relate to the incurv- 

 ing and recurving of very old branches. In many trees there is 

 no evidence of a tendency to bend till after the fifth year. For 

 some ten years after this, or in ten- or fifteen-year-old wood, the 

 phenomena is common. It may often be seen in the Tulip Poplar, 

 Liriodendron tulipifera, the White Ash, Fraxinus Americana, 

 the Pear tree, and many others. One of the best illustrations is 

 afforded by the Horse Chestaut, ^iiiculu.s Hippocastanum. The 

 branches all keep at an acute angle till the tree reaches an age of 

 about twenty-five years. Then the ten-year-old branches begin to 

 droop from near the ba,sal region at the trunk. They spend several 

 years in curving downward, and then make an incurve between 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 357 



the recurve and the apex. This method of first becoming a little 

 more horizontal, theu recurving near the base and incurving 

 toward the apex is quite common among coniferous trees. The 

 actual bending of the main trunk, which Prof. Bessev and myself 

 ascertained by actual observation in three specias of conifers, may 

 have another illustration in a specimen of the Himalayan Pine, 

 Pinm excelsa, on the estate of Caspar Heft in Germantown. It is 

 about fifty years old, and probably among the earliest introduced 

 . to American gardens. The heavy trunk is curved from near the 

 ground to about twenty feet upwardly. The verticels of branches 

 m this species of Pine extend all around the trunk in a regular 

 horizontal line. In the curved portion of this tree the straight 

 Ijranches on one side are directed above the horizontal line, on the 

 other side they point below. There can be no other explanation 

 of this than that the tree blew over when about twenty-five feet 

 high, and that the whole of this early twenty-five-year growth had 

 been made to curve. 



Most species of trees will have some of their mature branches 

 incurve or recurve at various ages; and this curving is often char- 

 acteristic of the species. The list i^ made up from specimens 

 growing on my own property, with the exception of a few left of 

 the original forest, all planted by myself within the past forty 

 years: 



Magnolia. 



In M. tripetela, M. Fraseri, M. compicua and M. macrophylla I 

 observe no disposition to curve at any age. But M. acuminata 

 sends out its upper branches at an acute angle, with the apices 

 incurved. After about five years they commence to descend by 

 a curve near the base. These curves of the lower branches increase 

 in width, until finally the upper portions of the branches again 

 incurve, as noted in many coniferre, especially of the Spruce 

 family. Plate XVI represents a thirty-five-year-old tree. 

 Tilia. 



The Lindens : No curving observed in T. Europcea, but in 

 mature trees of T. Americana they are common and striking. 

 Ilez. 



I have no large specimens of I. Aquifolium. In bushy speci- 

 mens of /. ojxica no curving noticed ; but where the plant has 




358 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



assumed a tree-form descent commences in the fire-year-old 

 branches, and they finally curve and recurve as in the Sj^ruces. 

 Koelreuteria. 



This seems naturally tortuous ; but the branches, once formed, 

 seem unchangeable. 



.Ssonlus. 



A. Hippoeastanum recurves remarkably, even in branches of 

 considerable age. 

 Acer. 



The Maple family : A. dasycarptim, the Silver Maple, is remark- 

 able for its eccentricity as regards the curving of its branches. 

 One form known in gardens as " Wier's Cut-leaved," has cord- 

 like pendulous branches, some of which straighten eventually and 

 ascend. The leading branches are mostly erect, and aid in the 

 heightening of the tree. Some individuals of the ordinary trees 

 recurve branches in great numbers when these are several years 

 old ; other specimens show no recunnng of individual branches. 

 The recurving of weaker branches is a common feature. A. 

 sacchariimm, the common Sugar Maple, seldom recurves the larger 

 branches; but the weaker ones frequently begin to curve when two 

 or three years old, and continue to such an extent as often to 

 form almost a circle. The species can be recognized at long dis- 

 tances by this character. In A. ncbnun, the Red Maple, I see no 

 disposition to curve; in A. platanoides none; but it occurs to a 

 small extent in ^. Pseudo-Platanus. A. macrophyllum, the Oregon 

 Maple, has the branches at a rather acute angle, with an incurved 

 apex. This charactei- seems unchangeable, and my thirty-year- 

 old tree has a broomy character. A. campestre, A. hvtum siiow 

 no curving characters. 

 Negundo. 



In the A.sh-leaved Maple I observed no tendency to curve in 

 either the Atlantic or Pacific coast species. 



Sophora. 



Xeither in this nor in Rohinia, Gledifsehkt nor any leguminose 

 plant have I noted any disposition to curve mature branches. 



Pyrns. 



In the rosaceons family the Pear is characteristic in recurving its 

 mature branches as it advances in life. In mv earlier rears the 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF THILADELPHIA. 359 



familiar arching was attributed to the weight of fruit. This I have 

 found erroneous. The curving of the large branches does not 

 begin until the tree has reached nearly the height it is to eventually 

 become. It is not seen on younger trees, no matter how much 

 fruit they may have to bear. This is also true of the Apple. The 

 Cherry does not curve. The Cerasus aerotina. Wild Cherry, shows 

 no disposition to curve, but in old specimens of C. Padns the 

 maturer lower branches often curve considerably. In Crataegus, 

 Amektnehier, and allies no tendency is observable. 



Cornus. 



Old bushes of Cornus Mas have the branches curved considerably 

 •with age. Nyssa, the Sour or Black Gum, starts horizontally from 

 the first. 



Oiospyros. 



Diospyros Virginiana, the Persimmon, has its branches more or 

 less tortuous at an early stage, but in about ten years the laterals 

 become more horizontal, and the ends of the branches curve up 

 from the fifth year's growth. ' 



Halesia. 



In H. tetraptera and H. dipUra there is no apparent curving, 

 but H. Meehani, a remarkable seedling sport in my garden from 

 H. tetraptera, has erect branches that recurve remarkably when a 

 few years old, giving the tree a curious wind-swept appearance. 

 Catalpa. 



Catalpabignonioides and C. speciosa, old trees, give the impression 

 of curvature with age, but I have not been able to decide this to 

 my satisfaction. The tortuosity may be due to early growth 

 alone. 



LauTus. 



The branchlets of Laurus Sassafras start out in early life at an 

 angle of about 45°, but after about five years assume a horizontal 

 direction. The succeeding branch system is tortuous, but seldom 

 becomes decumbent. 



Horus. 



The Mulberry family shows little disposition to depart from the 

 original plan of divergence. In some specimens of 3Iorics alba I 




360 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JuDC, 



have seen some of the lower brauches curved, which must have 

 occurred late in life, but this seems esceptinnal. 



Platanus. 



In P. occidental^ I have found uo sign of adult curving, but in 

 P. orientalis, the European species, the laterals change from 

 angular divergence to horizontal positions, and even recurving in 

 many cases. 



Juglans. 



The Walnut family, I believe, retain their early character 

 through life, though the English Walnut has a tortuous appear- 

 ance, 

 ftuerous. 



It is in Qnereus, or the Oak family, ihat we find the most inter- 

 est, as the numerous species afford material for comparison. The 

 angular divergence and ultimate positions seem so chai-acteristic 

 that we may have a reasonable assurance of the species when a 

 tree is seen from a rapidly passing railroad train. Qaercus jmhis- 

 iris, the Pin Oak, is a good illustration of what occurs in many 

 species (Plate XVII). 



The upper brauches grow at an acute angle, but after about 

 five years proceed to decline, the point of departure being at the 

 base, near the main trunk. By fifteen years they have become 

 horizontal, and continue declining until the divergence again 

 reaches an acute angle. Much the same procedure marks Quercus 

 Phello.^, the Willow Oak. Qmrcm tinctoria, the Black Oak, ha^ the 

 lateral branches horizontal at an early age, but I have never found 

 any go lower. This is true of the Quercm coccinea, the Scarlet 

 Oak, though to a less degree (Plate XVII). Quercus bicolor, the 

 Swamp White Oak, departs from its angular position toward the 

 horizontal when about teu years old, but never gets below the hori- 

 zontal line. Quercm maerocarpa (the Burr Oak\ Q. lyrata (the 

 Over-cup), Q. Primus (the Rock Chestnut), Q. rubra (the Red), I 

 have not found to vary from the original framework. This also 

 seems true of the European Quercus Robur, Q. Cerris (the Turkey 

 Oak), and of the Japan Q. dentata. Q. alba, with its frame of 

 branchlets almost as huge as its trunk, has been a puzzle to me. I 

 am inclined to believe that the angular divergence of the lateral 

 branches has not changed from the original plan. It may be noted 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 361 



that most species of Oak, when growing and in nursery rows, pro- 

 duce some weak side branches that soon become horizontal and 

 finally curve. 



Liqnidambar. 



The Sweet Gum, Liquidambar styraciflua, seems never to change 

 the angular divergence of its laterals so far as a few inches from 

 the base is concerned, but at a little beyond this they commence to 

 decline at about ten years old in much the same manner as the Pin 

 Oak, but eventually they take an upward bend, so that there is a 

 curving and incurving feature as in the Norway Spruce. 



Fraxinus. 



The Ashes, as a rule, retain their original plan through life, but 

 F. Americana and F. sambucifolia, the White Ash and the Black, 

 become very much curved in the older branches. 



Salix. 



In the Willow family I have noted no departures from the original 

 plan; the weeping variety of Salix Japonica, the well-known 

 Weeping Willow, excepted, as already noted. 



Ulmna. 



There seems to be some tendency in young plants of U. raeemosa, 

 the Thomas Elm, to have the weaker branchlets recurve; but I have 

 no mature specimen. 



Coniferse. 



In (he Cypresses, Juuipers and some Pines I have found no evi- 

 dence of the curving of mature branches, but in the Pines, Firs and 

 Spruces the fact is self-evident. The upper series of about ten 

 years of branching take an acute angle, then a horizontal direc- 

 tion at the base, which is eventually recurved, and finalh' an 

 incurving occurs toward the younger portion of the branches. In 

 many Pines — Pinus pungens, for instance — when the natural height 

 is about reached, the upper branchlets become horizontal. The 

 top of the tree is often as flat as if sheared to make a plane sur- 

 face. Judging by pictures of European scenery Pinus Pinea has 

 this habit in the Old World. 



Among monocotyledons, I have noted in the South specimens of 

 Chanuerops Palmetto, that had been evidently turned aside some- 




362 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



what iu their earlier growth, that had curved the main stem in the 

 effort to secure again the upright i^nsitiou. 



The facts adduced reveal to us a stupendous power in plant life, 

 of which biologists hitherto have taken little heed. True we have 

 had casual notes of mushrooms lifting heavy paving stones iu a 

 single night ; of the roots of trees throwing down stone walls and 

 cleaving dense rocks in wedge-like fashion. I have myself re- 

 corded a case where a large tree growing on a rock had by accre- 

 tions below lifted the whole of its immense weight of trunk and 

 branches, so that it did seem that the trunk had elongated and 

 that a side branch had been carried several inches above its orig- 

 inal distance from the ground, but the great significance of these 

 facts has not been made clear to us. The action of light, of 

 gravitation, or of any external condition as a factor iu direction 

 fails to satisfy us. It has bsen usual, especially of recent years, to 

 refer to conditions of environments as accounting for many of the 

 phenomena of life. Undoubtedly these conditions must operate to 

 some extent, or the speculations based on them could not command 

 the assent of so many great minds. We know, for instance, that 

 a plant growing vigorously in a cellar or dark room will incline 

 toward the light ; but I have shown in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy that in the dense darkness of mines species of Agaric, 

 growing from the roof or sides, curve their stipes upwardly, as do 

 mushrooms that spring up in a dark night on the side of a sloping 

 bank. I have also shown in the same publication that many plants 

 closely observed by me carry on their curving operations by night 

 rather than in the light of day. So in regard to the thought that 

 the operations of plant life are carried on for individual good —the 

 great weapon in the battle for life among modern hypotheses of 

 evolution, this must be true to a limited extent. In the case of 

 the Magnolia acuminata herewith illustrated (Plate XVI), we can 

 see that if (he curvings of the young shoots continued without any 

 change in the original direction of the main laterals, the head of 

 the tree would become as round as a cabbage and the interior 

 branches would be smothered out. The declination in time gives 

 scope to the young growtii, and even the final uprising of the 

 branch toward its apex is still kept within regulation distance of 

 its fellows. In the Fir and Spruce the self-utility of the curvatures 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3'33 



is clearly apparent. The tree could scarcely keep a mass of foliage 

 in healthy condition wholly to the ground if it adhered strictly 

 to the acute-angular method that marks the upper growths. 



So far we may trace the effort for individual benefit in the direc- 

 tion changes, but that conditions of environment are active forces 

 in the work may well be doubted from the fact of great variation 

 in the degrees of curvature. 



It has already been stated that the observations were made on 

 my own grounds. Comparing, however, trees of my own with 

 others of the same species on neighboring properties, we find wide 

 divergencies. In some trees of the same species there will be few 

 illustrations of curving, while in others nearly every large branch 

 ■will take on an arcuate form. This fact is illustrated in Plate 

 XVI of Magnoliu acuminata. The two trees are within thirty 

 feet of each other. The one on the right shows considerable 

 incurving. The upper branches have retained their original 

 angular divergence, and the bend toward the horizon as age 

 advanced has been gradual; only a few at the base and ou the one 

 side have reached that point. AYe can see that if this tree had 

 wholly lost the recurving power we should have a fastigiate indi- 

 vidual, closely imitating a Lombardy Poplar in form. But the 

 one on the left took early to recurving, and to such an extent that 

 it seemed to the good of the tree that these should ultimately 

 incurve in order to afiord room for a healthful branching devel- 

 opment. 



With all these individual variations there is still a general char- 

 acter assumed by each species, by which it may be distinguished as 

 well as by the characters derived from leaves, flowers or fruits. 

 In Quercus palustris, for instance (Plate XYII), there is little dis- 

 position to curvature in the decumbent branches. They bend very 

 close to the main trunk. They commence to diverge when about 

 five years old, and the continuously increasing degree of divergence 

 can be seen at a glance. This character will vary more or less in 

 different trees, but there is almost always enough in evidence to enable 

 one to distinguish the Pin Oak from other species. The Scarlet Oak, 

 Quercus coecinea, rarely shows any disposition to curve mature 

 branches. A representation of this species is given on the right 

 hand of the Pin Oak (Plate XVII). But here we may note again 

 that there is no necessity for it, as the original angle of divergence 




364 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



is sufRcient to allow for a fair development without subsequent 

 change. May we not borrow a simile from a class of metaphysicians 

 who contend that ' ' man is not merely a creature of circumstances, 

 but his character is mainly made for him and not by him/' and 

 believe that an inborn direction, and not environment to any great 

 extent, is the ruling power in vegetable life ? 



AVhat is the nature of this power that is capable of bending 

 with ease and without a break an old branch or trunk of a thick- 

 ness that would require an immense mechanical pressure for man 

 to accomplish ? How does it operate ? 



In the paper already cited' I drew attention to the fact that the 

 life-growth of a plant was in a measure a struggle against gravita- 

 tion, and that a great part of the nutrition prepared by the plant 

 was spent in supplying energy in this struggle. Consequently when 

 a plant received extraneous aid in the contest, the extra nutrition 

 saved by this assistance was diverted to extra growth and luxu- 

 riance. Many observations have since shown that to energy trans- 

 muted from nutrition we have to look for the various forms that 

 plants assume. To the highest degree of energy we may attribute 

 the chief triumph of growth force over gravitation. This is ex- 

 emplified in the leading shoot of Pine trees. Observers know that 

 in this leading shoot the highest vegetative force is exhibited. It 

 so successfully resists aU gravitating influences that it is drawn in 

 no degree from an exact perpendicular. If, however, the main 

 growing shoot of a vigorous tree is broken off, the extra nutrition 

 diverted from the centre to the lateral branches supplies one of 

 these with an extra degree of energy, and a new leader arises in 

 place of the lost one. From this we deduce the law that plants 

 are engaged in a contest with gravitation, and that geotropism' is 

 in proportion to the degree of energy lost in the contest. 



Going over the list of plants enumerated in this paper, we note 

 that decumbency is in proportion to the decline of vigor, and we 

 find this to be the case in individual trees generallj'. AVhal are 

 known in gardens as fastigiate trees, of which the Lombardy 

 Poplar is a type, are remarkable for the vigor of the central shoot 

 and laterals. Weeping ti-ees, on the other hand, are characterized 

 by decreased vigor. The normal form of Salix Japonica, of 

 which the so-called Babylonian Willow is an offspring, is very 



^Proc. Acad. Nat. Set. Phtla., 1866, p. 401. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 365 



strong in comparison with the variety. The Kilmarnocli Weeping 

 Willow is weak in comparison with Sallx caprea, its parent, and 

 this is true of all the weeping trees in gardens — they are all in 

 various degrees more slender and delicate than the normal forms 

 of the same species. 



The ability to overcome gravitation has been lost, in proportion 

 to the lessened degree of energy. 



How does this view account for the case of the incurving of 

 branches that have become decumbent ? 



It seems like a mere restatement of the fact to say that the 

 incurving branch has simply regained a power to successfully resist 

 gravitation it had never wholly lost. When we note, however, 

 that these incurves are all methodical, and only occur when they 

 are evidently beneficial to the plant, we may infer that energy 

 itself is not blindly directed, but is under the control of a life- 

 power within the plant that is able to strengthen a weak position 

 when it is for the general good. We see this when it undertakes 

 to heal a wound ; we only extend our view of this power to meet 

 these new cases. 



In conclusion, trees have the power, not merely to grow into 

 various forms as it is usually understood, but to bend mature 

 branches when exigencies require it; and this display of power 

 results from varying degrees of energy employed by plants in 

 their struggle with gravitation.

OBSERVATIONS UPON THE PLACENTA AND YOUNG OF 

 DASYPUS SEXCINCTUS. 



BY HEXEY C. CHAPMAN, M. D. 



The Edentata, so called by Cuvier on account of the teeth being 

 so imperfectly developed or absent in the representatives of the 

 order, includes a very heterogeneous assemblage of animals — ant- 

 eaters, sloths, armadillos — differing very much in their internal 

 organization, especially iu the character of their jilacentation. 

 Thus the placenta in the Cape ant-eater, Oryduropus, is deciduous 

 and, according to some authorities,' discoidal, to oLliers' zonular 

 inform. In the Tamandua, T. tetntdadylu, it is possibly deciduous 

 and discoidal;' in the sloths, Cholcepiis Hoffmann!, it is decidu- 

 ous and loboid in form;* iu the Pangolin, 3Iiin{s, f non-decidu- 

 ous and diffuse;' in certain species of armadillos, e. g. Dasyptu 

 novemcinctus, possibly deciduous and discoidal." 



In view of the fact that such profound differences exist in the 

 placentation of the Edentata, it is hoped that the following obser- 

 vations upon the placenta and young of the six-banded armadillo 

 born in the Philadelphia Zoological Garden and submitted to the 

 author for examination by Mr. A. E. Brown, Secretary of the 

 Society, will prove acceptable. It should be mentioned in this 

 connection that in the case of the placenta of Dasypus novemcinc- 

 tus as described by Milne-Edwards,' four fojtuses were found 

 enclosed in one chorion. Such a disposition, far from being an 

 abnormal one, would seem to be that usually obtaining, at least in 

 that species of armadillo, since the same number of foetuses were

observed enclosed in a common chorion by Kolliker' before, and 

 by Duges' after Milne Edwards' observations. Different explana- 

 tions have been offered by anatomists of this apparent anomaly of 

 one chorion enclosing a number of foetuses. The most satisfac- 

 tory as yet offered, though hypothetical, the early development of 

 the armadillo being unknown, is that originally the number of 

 chorions correspond to the number of foetuses, but that as devel- 

 opment advances the adjacent walls of the primitively distinct 

 chorions fuse together and ultimately break down, the result being 

 the formation of one chorion. In the case of the six-bauded arma- 

 dillo, Dasypus sexcinctus, the mother gave birth to but one young, 

 and there were no reasons for supposing that more than one ^vas 

 developed during the pregnancy. 



The young armadillo (Plate XVIII, %. 1), the firstborn at the 

 Philadelpliia Zoological Garden, a .Tiale which lived but a few 

 hours, was perfectly developed and measured from snout to end of 

 tail 25 centimeters (10 inches). The most striking feature of the 

 young animal externally was the size of the penis, it measuring 3.7 

 centimeters (1.5 inches). It is well known that this organ attains 

 an enormous size in the adult armadillo, absolutely as well as 

 relalively. Six distinct broad bauds and two indistinct narrow 

 ones were observed on the dorsal surface, but they were as yet soft 

 to the touch. 



No trace was found of an umbilical vesicle, amnion, or any 

 part of the chorion except that entering into the formation of the 

 placenta. The umbilical cord measured 22.5 centimeters (9 

 inches), the vessels not being spirally disposed, as was also observed 

 by Milne-Edwards to be the case in the Tamandua. The umbilical 

 vessels were so much torn (having been apparently gnawed by the 

 mother) as to make it impossible to inspect the placenta through 

 them. A mixture of gelatine and carmine was, however, forced 

 directly into a few of the small vessels of the placenta, which 

 consisted of the villous processes of the chorion only, without 

 admixture of any maternal tissue, and was therefore non-decidu- 

 ate. The foetal villi were disposed as a girdle or zone (Plate 

 XVIII, fig. 2) on that part of the chorion in contact with the

Uterus. The zone measured from outer edge to outer edge about 

 5 centimeters (2 inches), the average breadth of the rim of the 

 zone 1.2 centimeters (.5 inch), the breadth of the space between 

 the inner edges of the zone and destitute of villi 2.5 centimeters 

 (1 inch). The placenta in the six-bauded armadillo is not, how.- 

 ever, a zonular one in the sense in which that word is used by 

 anatomists. It does not surround the chorion as a broad band, the 

 poles of the latter being bare as in the " diffuse " uou-deciduate 

 placenta of the pig; nor as a narrow one as in the "zonular" 

 deciduous placenta of the Carnivora, etc. It should be regarded 

 morphologicallv rather as a discoidal placenta, the central portion 

 of the dis'k— ihat is, the part of the chorion lying within the inner 

 edges of the rims of the villous zone— presenting, however, no 

 villi. The placenta in Da»ypm sexeinctm being therefore ring- 

 shaped, rather than discoid in form, if it be permitted to introduce 

 a new name in anatomical nomenclature, it might be described as 

 'a non-deciduate cricoid placenta." The villi, measuring on an 

 average 20 mm. (.8 inch), were not simple as in the Pachy- 

 dermata, Camelidte and Tragulidse, but compound a-, in Man. 

 They presented a beautiful arborescent appearance (Plate XVIII, 

 fig 3), the terminal twigs ending in bulbous or rounded extremi- 

 ties (fig. 4). As is well known, Von Baer,".Eschricht," the elder 

 MilueEdwards," Huxley,'^ and in recent times Haeckel," advo- 

 cated classifying the monodelphous mammalia according to the 

 character of the placentation. It is obvious, however, as shown 

 by the summary given below, that on such a basis the different 

 members of the Edentata would be associated with mammals with 

 which they have no natural affinities, just as, according to such 

 classification, totally different animals like the Hyrax, Elephant, 

 and Carnivora are associated, and which constitutes one of the most 

 important objections that have been urged to the acceptance of 

 such classification.

Sphodromerus sanguiniferus n. sp. 



Type; c?; no data. 



Closely allied to S. inconspicuus Schulthess^ but differing in the 

 number of spines on the external margin of the hind tibire (incon- 

 spicuus 9, sanguiniferus 7), and the absence of a black fasciation 

 on the same. A close relationship also exists with <S'. decoloratus 

 Finot,' but several characters are quite at variance. 



Form thickset and robust. Head with the vertex declivent, 

 posteriorly with a slight carina; frontal costa expanding inferiorly, 

 sulcate except immediately around the ocellus; eyes prominent, 

 globose ; antennre depressed, longer than head and prouotum. 

 Fronotum rugose, posteriorly expanding, median carina well devel- 

 oped, cut by three sulci ; anterior margin subtruncate, posterior 

 rectangulate, the border somewhat sinuate; lateral lobes separated 

 from the dorsum by well-marked lateral carinre, posterior angle 

 subrotundate, the matazona punctate. Tegmina short, not reaching 

 the tip of the femora. Anterior and median femora robust, 

 slightly bowed. Posterior femora very robust, the superior and 

 inferior margins well developed, the former serrate; tibite stout, 

 armed with seven spines on the external and internal margins. 

 Subgenital plate bowl-shaped, the posterior jjortiou very slightly 

 produced ; supraanal plate subtriangular with two median ridges, 

 subobsolete anteriorly; cerci very heavy, with an external blunt 

 denticle. 



General color ferruginous ; lower part of head, outer face of 

 posterior femora and lower surface yellowish, the head very pale. 

 Pronotum and tegmina washed with dull reddish. Tegmina with 

 four longitudinal rows of blackish spots. Lateral and superior 

 surfaces of the hind femora with two obsolete blackish bars, the 

 inferior internal face of the same sanguineous. Posterior tibioe 

 sanguineous, the spines ochraceous with black tips.

 Cymatomera hyperborea n. sp. 



Types; two males, one female; Higo, country of the Boran, 

 Gallaland, April 8, 1895 (2); near the Galena Amara, between 

 Lenja Amara and El Re, Gallaland, May 25, 1895. 



This species is allied to C. modeda, from which it differs in numer- 

 ous particulars, as the truncate anterior margin of the pronotum, 

 the difTereut development of the metazona of the same, besides the 

 almost total absence of black in the coloring. The new form also 

 exhibits a close affinity to C. brunneri Brancsik,' but it ditl'ers from 

 that species in the much lower metazonal crest and the absence of 

 any foliaceous development of the superior margins of the posterior 

 femora. 



General form elongate. Head with the vertex produced, the ape.>c 

 narrowly truncate, the lateral margins being sinuate ; front broad anil 

 flattened, finely punctate; eyes very j)romiueut, spherical; anteunie 

 exceeding the total length. Pronotum with the anterior margin trun- 

 cate, posterior subrotuudate ; prozona with a central lamellate ridge, 

 the margin being dentate, the exact number of teeth (.3-7) being

variable, the anterior lateral augle with a spiue followed after a 

 short space by another; central metazonal ridge lamellate, the 

 margin crenulate, in one case decidedly bidentate, the postero- 

 lateral angle occupied by a bifid process which roofs the humeral 

 sinus; lateral lobes with the lower margin centrally emarginate, the 

 median area of the lobes occupied by three spines arranged longi- 

 tudinally, the central one smaller than the others. Tegmina with 

 the apex subacute, the cross veins of the discoidal area very 

 prominent. Femoi-a of all the limbs with both margins with foli- 

 aceous extensions, except the superior surfaces of the anterior and 

 posterior femora, the extensions with the margins crenulate ; fora- 

 mina on the anterior femora very prominent ; posterior femora 

 feebly spined below on both margins. Sternal plate with very 

 large foveolte. Ovipositor considerably longer than the pronotum. 

 General color pale ferruginous (probably green in life, as one 

 specimen bears traces of that colorj, varied with whitish on the 

 head, pronotum and limbs, and sienna on the transverse veins of the 

 discoidal area of the tegmina. Lower surface pale yellow. Au- 

 tennre whitish, annulated with umber; head and pronotum laterally 

 dusted with whitish. Costal area of the tegmina anteriorly 

 blackish.

NEW JAPANESE MARINE, LAND AND FKESH-WATER MOLLUSCA. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY'. 



The present paper continues the description of new species of 

 mollusks discovered by Mr. Y. Hirase. I have taken this oppor- 

 tunity to illustrate the Japanese marine shells described in a former 

 cominunicatiou. ' 



FLEUROTOMIDiE. 

 Daphnella fragilis vnr. artioulata nov. Pl. xxr, lig. 20. 



General form of D. frarjilis (Rve.) or D. Itjm^oijormis (Kien.). 

 Apical two whorls smooth; several whorls following sculptured 

 with unequal spiral cords, as coarse as those on the last whorl, 

 densely crenulate or beaded by close fine longitudinal lamina, 

 much less prominent and closer than the spirals. Last whorl 

 densely and evenly latticed by alternately larger and smaller spiral 

 cords intersecting scarcely less prominent, but rather closer, longi- 

 tudinal rib-strife. Pale brown, every fourth cord marked with 

 brown in narrow lines along the cord, alternating with diffused 

 white spots; a row of alternately brown and white squarish spols 

 below the suture; the early whorls brown. Aperture smooth 

 within, the outer lip thin, regularly arcuate, rather strongly 

 retracted above. Length 19, diam. 7, largest axis of aperture 

 11 mm.

 types No. 80,634 Coll. A. N. S. P.; Kamakura, just below Tokyo 

 Bay, on the eastern side of Hondo (Acad. Coll.). 



Mr. Tryon has lumped several totally distinct species under D. 

 lymnmjornm, but the form so called by Kiener is less plump than 

 artieulaia, with even, close spirals and inconspicuous longitudinal 

 sculpture on the last whorl, while the spire has comparatively 

 strong costaj and rather coarse spirals. The color, well shown in 

 Kiener's figure, is whitish, with tawny, waved and anastomosing 

 hmgitudinal stripes. D. fragilis has not yet, to my knowledge^ 

 ' These Proceedings, p. 1 93.

386 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Julj, 



been adequately defined; but the form I have considered to be that 

 species has a small, elevated nucleus of 2h whorls, followed by 

 about three costate whorls, the ribs crossed by two or three coarse 

 spiral cords; after which the sculpture becomes comparatively fine. 

 If I am correct in this identification, then articulata is a distinct 

 species; but as Hedley has lately hinted, many of the more critical 

 or difficult species of the " London School" of conchologists, of 

 which A. Adams and Reeve were shining lights, can be identified 

 with certainty only by visiting the British Museum. ° Under the 

 circumstances I subordinate my form from .Japan to D. frar/ilis as 

 a variety, content to have a name for this well-marked shell, evi- 

 dently of wide distribution in Japanese waters. 



D. supercostata of E. A. Smith seems, from a specimen before 

 me, to belong near Jragilis, though clearly distinct in both form 

 and sculpture. D. ornata Hinds from New Guinea is evidently 

 allied, though with a different color-pattern. 



MITRID^. 

 Mitra (Costellaria) hizenensis n. sp. PI. XXI, fig. 31. 



Shell slender, solid, dusky olive, with a brown or orange-brown 

 and rather prominent subsutural line and an ill-defined white zone 

 at the shoulder, in which the summits of the ribs are transversely 

 marked with short scattered brown lines; the narrow portion of 

 the base is pale yellow, with brown spots and dots. Surface lather 

 glossy, sculptured with rounded longitudinal ribs, nearly or quite 

 as wide as their intervals, 1.3 or 14 in number on the penultimate 

 whorl, becoming grailually weaker below the periphery of the last 

 whorl, and in adults obsolete toward the aperture; the concave in- 

 tervals cro.ssed by very low, flat spirals, rather wider than the shal- 

 low, oblong pits between them, and about G in number on the 

 penultimate whorl. The last whorl is attenuated below, and has a 

 number of large spiral ribs and small cords and striie, the largest 

 rib continuous with the upper columellar plait. Whorls about ; 

 apex dark. ■ Aperture small, dark purple-brown within, tlia lip 

 thin, white-bnrdered, multilirate inside. Columella with four sim- 

 ple plaits. Length 14.-5, diam. 5, longest axis of aperture 7.5

Near M. fuscoapkata E. A. Smith, but it Las more and shallower 

 spiral sulci in the intervals between the ribs, which are fewer in 

 number; it is smaller, the upper two plaits of the columella are 

 not grooved, and the coloration is somewhat different. J/, fjoioensli 

 and M. collinsoni have more numerous ribs. In adult specimens 

 of M. hhenemu the latter third of the last whorl is smooth, the 

 costfe disappearing. 



Mitra (Costellaria) vanattai n. sp. pi. xxi, fig. as. 



Shell rather slender, solid, brownish olive, with a wide dark- 

 brown band below the periphery, and a light brown line at the 

 shoulder, the base brown. Surface rather glossy, sculptured with 

 rounded longitudinal ribs, as wide as the smooth concave intervals, 

 14 in number on the penultimate whorl, obsolete on the latter half 

 of the last whorl; the attenuated base sculptured with spiral cords, 

 the largest continuous with the upper plait of the columella, those 

 below it (about 4) progressively smaller; a few small spirals above 

 the large cord. Whorls remaining 8 (the apex being eroded), 

 somewhat convex. Aperture bluish and finely lirate deep within^ 

 purple brown toward the white-bordered ihin lip. Columella with 

 5 plaits, the upper strong, not grooved. Length 17, diam. 7, 

 longest axis of aperture 8 mm.

This species was sent with the preceding, from which it is easily 

 separated by the want of spiral sculpture between the ribs. Some- 

 what allied to M. semisculpta, but it differs in the smooth intervals. 

 M. amdofjica Reeve has fewer plaits, according to the descriftiou.' 



MURIOIDiB. 

 Tritonidea submenkeana n. sp. Pl. XXI, flg. 2J. 



Shell short-fusiform, very solid and strong. Sculptured with 

 longitudinal ribs, 12 to 15 in number on the last whorl, the last 

 rib very much larger, forming a large, swollen varix behind the 

 ip; crossed by spiral cords which are low in the intercostal spaces 

 but rise and widen into transverse, oblong, glossy tubercles where • 

 they cross the ribs; the penultimate and earlier whorls having 




388 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF ['Tuly, 



three such spiral cords, the hist whorl with ten (counted just 

 behind the outer lip) ; the intervals between the spiral cords every- 

 where densely, finely striate. Surface lustreless, black, (he inter- 

 vals between ribs and a peripheral belt largely white; the tubercles 

 of the subsutural cord are mostly brown, the others chiefly black. 

 Whox'ls about 8, but slightly convex, the spire being rather 

 straightly conic; last whorl impressed below the suture, concave 

 below the periphery, produced and spirally striated anteriorly. 

 Aperture less than half the length of the shell, blue-white inside, 

 the lip beveled, with a brown spot at the termination of each spiral 

 cord, thickened within and contracted by six rounded teeth, the 

 upper one more widely separated than the others, the second from 

 above largest. CoKimellar margin concave above with a pliciforra 

 tooth near the posterior angle, straightened and rather wide below, 

 bearing five or six transverse tubercles. Length 15, diam. 7, 

 longest axis of aperture 7.5 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen, western Kiusiu (Mr. Y. Hirase). Types No. 

 80,538 Coll. A. N. S., from 1,037 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This little black-and-white species groups with T. menkeana 

 Dkr., a shorter shell with similar coloration. The unusual promi- 

 nence of the tubercles on the columellar lip, and the sculpture of 

 ribs tuberculate at the intersections of spiral cords, give it much the 

 appearance of a Sktrum. 



PURPURA. 



The hdeoshma group of Purpura was too much lumped in my 

 Catalogue of Japanese IMarine Mollusks. From a renewed study 

 of them, with much more material, it seems that the following four 

 Japanese forms are recognizable: P. luteodoma (Chemn.) Dillwyn, 

 P. hronni Dkr., P. clavigera Kiister, P. tumidosa vax. problematica 

 Baker (=; tunutlosa Lischke not Reeve). I formerly followed 

 !Mr. E. A. Smith' in referring the latter to P. alveolata Reeve; 

 but I am now convinced that alveolata is, as Reeve stated, a 

 Panamic species. We have specimens from Panama in our collec- 

 tion exactly like his figure. 



Mr. Hirase sends the Californian species P. saxicoln Val. from 

 Kisennuma, Rikuzen, on the east coast of Hondo.

Euthria hokkaidonis n. sp. PI. XIX, fig. 17. 



Shell slender, fusiform, moderately solid, yellowish or purplish 

 a.shen. Surface lustreless, sculptured with slightly oblique longi- 

 tudinal rounded folds as wide as their intervals, 13 or 14 in num- 

 ber on the penultimate whorl, wanting on the base of the last 

 whorl, where they disappear just below the periphery; crossed by 

 spiral cords alternating with threads or stria3, of which there are 

 usually two in each interval; the coarser cords about 5 in number 

 on the whorls of the spire, slightly widening as they cross the longi- 

 tudinal folds; the spirals alone developed on the base. Spire high; 

 whorls about 9, very convex, separated by deep sutures; the last 

 whorl concave below, produced in a slender, somewhat recurved 

 rostrum; siphonal ridge convex. Aperture small, ovate, acumi- 

 nate above, livid dull purple inside, with 8 to 10 acute folds within 

 the thin-edged outer lip; canal short and open.

 Columbella misera Sowerby. PI. XXI, figs. 37, 3S. 



C. miser Sowb., Thes. Conch., I, p. 129 bis, PI. 38, fig. 111. 

 This species is figured to illustrate its difference from the follow- 

 ing. It was taken in some numbers at Kamakura, province Sag- 

 ami (below the mouth of Tokyo Bay), by Jlr. Frederick Stearns. 

 It is very strongly ribbed, especially on the spire, the ribs being 

 about half the width of the interstices, about 11 or 12 in number 

 on the penultimate whorl, or on the last, when they are not obsolete 

 on its latter part, which is frequently the case. On the front of 

 the last whorl these ribs extend well over the periphery, but they 

 become much shorter on its latter half, or wholly obsolete. The 

 base is sculptured with coarse spiral cords, which become increas- 

 ingly weaker and obsolete as they approach the periphery. Color 

 white, luith one or two dark brown sjwts on each rib and a checkered 

 striped basal zone; the back of the last whorl irregularly striped' or 

 reticulate; a white zme, usually brown-dotted on each rib, re-

 No. 1,097 of Mr. Hirase's collection. Study of more specimens 

 causes me to doubt whether the characters of this form are con- 

 stantly different enough from misera to require specific rank. Tlie 

 following variety connects them to some extent.

 Gaskoiu, P. Z. S., 1851, p. 13. 



Specimens agreeing exactly with Reeve's figure were taken by 

 Mr. Hirase at Hirado, Hizeu. They are larger than C. misera, 

 but agree with that in sculpture, except that there are one or two 

 more ribs to a whorl. Tl)e coloi-ation is much darker. There is a 

 white SLibsutural zone pied with black, and a white basal area 

 striped with black-brown; the intermediate space being more or 

 less suffused with rich brown and copiously lineated with black - 

 brown. The ribs are black below the subsutural zone. Whorls 

 over seven. Alt. 13.5, diam. 6.5 mm.; alt. 14, diam. 6 mm. 



Prof, von Martens has quoted this race as a synonym of his C. 

 japonica, but I think incorrectly. It is much nearer the true 

 misera, and in my opinion is a southern variety of that species. The 

 name given by Reeve is unfortunate, as it is not a Californian 

 species. The .specimen figured is No. 80,507 Coll. A. N. S. P., 

 from No. 1,230 of Mr. Hirase' s collection 



C. misera inhabits the ocean coast of Hondo; C misera var.

Bucoinum Hirasei n. sp. PI. XX, fig. 22. 



Shell solid, turreted, partly covered with an olive-brown cuticle; 

 composed of about 8 whorls, which are convex at the periphery, 

 contracted below, and channeled above; the channel rather wide, 

 flat, bounded by a strongly elevated, slightly uneven carina. 

 Sculpture of faint growth-lines and a few low spiral cords, hardly 

 noticeable en the last whorl. Aperture .slightly ovate, angular at 

 the termination of the carina, the basal notch not very deep. 

 Outer lip smooth, not thickened, somewhat expanded. Opt^rculum 

 unknown. 



Length 104, diam. 43, longest axis of aperture 37 mm. 



Kizeunuma, Rikuzen (^Ir. Y. Hirase, No. 556). 



This magnificent species is known to me by the single specimen 

 figured, which was collected dead. The outer lip is broken above 

 the middle, so that its true outline in that part is not given in the 

 figure. The cuticle has nearly all been lost, and the shell is over- 

 grown with Polyzoa, Spiroi-bis, etc. 



The conspicuous channel at the suture is formed almost exactly 

 like that of Chrysodomus pericochlion (Schrenk), a species occur- 

 ring with B. Hirasei at Kizeunuma. The similarity is so great 

 that I have figured Schrenk' s species for comparison. 



Chrysodomus pericochlion. (Schrenk). PI. XX, lig. 23. 



The specimen here figured is longer and less inflated than the 

 original type of the species as figured by Schrenk. The dark 

 olive cuticle, wanting from the base of the shell, resembles that 

 of Buccinum Hirasei, and reminds one of the cuticle of such fresh- 

 water snails as Viviparus or Campelonia.

This genus has been used to cover certain species formerly re- 

 ferred to Poiamides, by Jousseaume in 1884/ and by Dollfus and 

 Dautzenberg in 1899/ and for the group long known as Vertagus 

 by Dall in 1892/ The latter usage I find to be correct. In the 

 first volume of the Universal Concholorjy Martyn introduces Clava 

 for the Cerithiklce known to him — a group which had previously 

 been referred to Murex by Linnteus. He gives the following 

 species : 



Clava rugata Martyn (^= Cerithium lineatum Lam. ")• 



Clava herculea Martyn (= Cerithium ebeninum Brug. ). 



Clava niaculata Martyn (= Cerithium macidomm auct. ). 



Clava Tubus Martyn (^ Cerithium echinatum Lam.). 



In following volumes of the same work, Martyn adds still other 

 forms of Clava. But it is obvious that a type for the genus must 

 be selected from species contained in his first volume. Now the 

 C. herculea of his list was made type of the genus Pyrazus by 

 Montfort in 1810,' under the name Pyrazus haudini Montf. C. 

 rubus falls into Cerithium as now restricted.' This leaves C. 

 maculata^ and C. rugata to bear the name Clava. The two species 

 are not closely related, and the latter may he considered type of 

 Martyn's genus. The name Vertagus, used for this group by many 

 authors, had no standing in binomial nomenclature until long after 

 the foundation of Clava.

' Cerithium was e-stablislied by Bniguiere to contain species of Vertagus 

 and Potamides of authors, as well as the forms to which it is now restricted. 



Clava rubus of Martyn is the welt -known Cerithium echinatum of La- 

 marck, which name it must replace. It is not the Cerithium rubus ol English 

 monographers or of Tryon, who followed tlicir error. Kohelt, in his mono- 

 graph in the new edition of Chemnitz'.s Conchylien Cabinet, p. 213, 

 quotes "C. rubus Pilsljry, Manual, IX, p. 103, PI. 23, fig. 9," as a synonym 

 of C. serratum Wood. I was not responsible for volume IX of the Man- 

 ual, my work beginning in volume X. AVith a "?" he also quotes "Olaviis 

 rubus Martyn." But Martyn's Clava rubus was a totally different shell, 

 the C. echinatum of authors, a common Polynesian species. The failure on 

 the part of monographers to recognize this fact was due to want of care ; 

 neither the Universal Conchology nor Chenu's reprint have been consulted 

 by them. 



• C. maculata is the "C. maculosum" of English monographers and of 

 Tryon ; another curions error. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 393 



No species of the type proposed by Dr. Jousseaume and ^Messrs. 

 DoUfus and Dautzenberg was contained in Martyn's original list. 

 Their u?e of the name Clava is therefore without proper founda- 

 tion, while Dall's course is clearly supported by the evidence of 

 Martyn's original work. 



The Vertagus pfefferi ot Duuker is not a Vertag us or Clava, but 

 a true Cerithlum, which I have received from Hirado, prov. Hizen, 

 Japan (collected by Mr. Hirase). and from Hong Kong (B. 

 Schmacker). It is very close to C. gmnosuin Kiener (not of 

 Searles Wood, 1848), which was described from the Red Sea, and 

 has been reported by Lischke (Jap. Meeres- Conchy I., I, p. 68) 

 from Nagasaki. C. mitneforme Sowb. seems to differ but little, if 

 at all, aud C. exlmium, Sowb. and mbus of Sowerby and Tryon" 

 may be the same thing. As there is great uncertainty about the 

 species of Kiener and Sowerby, I prefer to use the name given by 

 Dunker, based upon Japanese specimens, aud with a good descrip- 

 tion and figures, for the Japanese form. 



Cerithium ohemnitzianum n. sp. PI. .\IX, figs. 14, lb. 



Shell oblong-conic, strong, pale yellow, sparsely maculate and 

 densely dotted with rich brown. Sculptured with many very low 

 spiral cords which are weakly granose, the grains irregularly alter- 

 nating brown aud white; the upper two cords with stronger grains. 

 There are about 10 of these cords on the latter part of the last 

 whorl, 4 on the penultimate, and 3 on each of the earlier whorls. 

 The intervals between cords are densely striate spirally, the striae 

 usually very unequal, a median one generally larger, sometimes 

 nearly as large as the primary cords, and brown-dotted. Outlines 

 of the spire convex below, becoming straight above. Whorls 

 remaining 8 (the apex being eroded), the upper ones flattened, 

 the last three somewhat convex just below the sutures, the last 

 whorl having a very strong, tumid, oblique varix on the back, aud 

 another less elevated one strengthening the outer lip. Aperture 

 slightly oblique, the base being a little advanced, white within; 

 outer Mp strongly arched, almost forming a semicircle. Columellar 



1° That the English monographers and Tryon should have identified this 

 small species as Martyn's Clava rubus is inexplicable. Murex serrattis 

 of Wood, in the Index Testaceologiciis, PI. 28, iig. 15S, is a much reduced 

 and poor figure of the true C. rubus Martyn ; but C. serratum of the Eng- 

 lish and German monographs is fjnite another thing.

The sculpture is much more feeble than in C. inonis or its imme- 

 diate allies, though some forms referable to moras resemble this 

 species in form. 



The figure of C. janellii var. in the zoology of the Astrolabe 

 et Zelee, Atlas, PI. 24, fig. 22, resembles C. chemnUzianum some- 

 what, but differs in the plicate spire. In the monographs by Reeve, 

 Tryou and Kobelt I fail to find anything much like the present spe- 

 cies. This shell is named for the author of the most extensive shell 

 iconography of the eighteenth century, a work of utility up to this 

 day. Would that A. Adams, a hundred years later, had defined 

 liis species half as well ! is one's thought on working with Japanese 

 moUusks.

PYRAMIDELLIDJE. 

 Syrnola bacillum n. sp pi. XXI, fig. 2.->. 



Shell slender, rod-like, marbled reddish-brown and white, with 

 a narrow baud of alternate brown and white spots revolving raid- 

 way between sutures and on the middle of the upper surface of the 

 last whorl, which has a white peripheral belt; this coloring 

 sometimes very fa.int. Nuclear whorl standing obliquely on edge, 

 the very short spire inclined downward; subsequent whorls 12i or 

 13, flat, separated by deeply cut sutures, sculptured with faint 

 growth-lines and an impressed line revolving below the suture; 

 some very faint spirals showing elsewhere in certain lights. Periph- 

 ery rounded, the base convex, subperforate. Ajierture small, 

 narrowly ovate; columella bearing a single strong fold.

A very narrow species, with a particular style of coloration, 

 which at times, however, is very faint. The widely distril)uted 

 Syrnola brunnea also occurs at the same locality. S. aeiculata A. 

 Ad., of which I have compared specimens from Fiji, is a larger 

 species with more convex whorls.

Eulima dunkeriana n. ?p. PI. XXI, fig. 30. 



A glos.^y, white, straight species, remarkably thick above, being 

 thus somewhat cylindric. Whorls 9^, a trifle convex, the linear 

 suture being margined below (at least on ihe upper half of the 

 shell) with a translucent band (sometimes enclosing a white band), 

 one-fourth to one-third the width of the whorl, the lower margin 

 of which, in some lights, looks like the suture itself, though there 

 is no impression at that place. At the last half-whorl there is an 

 imj^ressed varix-line ; another in line with it is on the preceding 

 whorl, while the next earlier whorl shows a similar impression 

 somewhat in advance of these. On another snecimen about 1 mm. 

 shorter, and evidently not full grown, there is on the last whorl a 

 single varix-line. The aperture is narrowly and acutely ovate; 

 lip .simple, a little obtuse. Length 11.2, diam. 2.6, longest axis 

 of the aperture 3.2 mm,

Close to E. phiUppiana (Dunker)," which was taken at Kama- 

 kura by JMr. Frederick Stearns; but E. dunkeriana differs in the 

 much broader form. E. pliUipplana has not been well figured. 

 A specimen from Kamakura before me has an impressed varix-line

short of correspouding with the position of the peristome; another 

 on line with it is upon the preceding whorl; the next earlier whorl 

 has a varix-line near its beginning, almost a whorl being thus with- 

 out a varix. A young shell, 6 ram. long, has one varix-line on 

 the back of the penultimate whorl. E. jihilippiana measures, alt. 

 10.2, diam. 2.15, longest axis of aperture 2.67 mm. Dunker gives 

 alt. 11, diam. 2 mm. for the type. 



Evidently these species have resting stages at irregular intervals, 

 and the varix-lines are inconstant in position and number. 



Both of these species are remarkable for the thickness of the 

 upper part of the spire, though this feature is more exaggerated in 

 E. diuikeriana. 



Eulima luohuana n. sp. Fl. XXI, fig. 2). 



Shell white and glossy, conic, curved slightly to the right, that 

 margin being about straight while the left side is a little convex, 

 regularly tapering, 9i whorls remaining (the apex being decollate), 

 slightly convex, the penultimate whorl having an impressed varix- 

 line at its last sixth, the preceding whorl with one on line with 

 the peristome, the next earlier whorl with a varix-line correspond- 

 ing in position to that on the penultimate whorl; the varices thus 

 being all on the right or incurved side. Aperture ovate-acuminate, 

 the lip a little obtuse.

Assiminea angustata n. sp 



Shell minute, imperforate, or nearly so, long ovate-conic, solid, 

 red-brown, glossy and smooth. Whorls about 5i, rather flattened, 

 the last one convex. Ajjerture small, rounded-ovate, oblique; 

 peristome simple, the columellar and parietal margins somewhat 

 thickened. Length 3, diam. 1.7, longest axis of aperture 1.2 mm.

NERITIDJE. 

 Nerita martensiana n. sp. 



Shell globose, small, solid, rather bright sulphur yellow, paler 

 and somewhat mottled with gray or blackish toward the aperture. 

 Surface dull, sculptured with low, rather coarse spiral cords, about 

 15 on the last whorl, the upper one appressed against the precediug 

 whorl. Spire short, whorls about 3, the last a little depressed below 

 the suture, which is bordered below by a somewhat more promi- 

 nent cord. Aperture semicircular, yellow or whitish; lip-rib 

 smooth, with a small tubercle above, and another well within near 

 the base of the columella. Columellar area white or yellowish, flat 

 and smooth, the outer border well defined; edge of columella 

 straight, with two or three low, subobsolete teeth, the upper one 

 strongest.

Small as this species is, the specimens are apparently adult. The 

 smooth columellar area, with well-defined outer margin, weak 

 denticulation and smooth rib within the outer lip are its more 

 prominent charactei-s. I find no species agreeing with these speci- 

 mens in the monographs, the best of which is that by Prof, von 

 Martens in the new edition of Chemnitz. 

 Nerita helioinoides var. tristis nov. 



Shell black with some white spots along the basal margin, and 

 sometimes a few angular pink and white spots elsewhere. Colu- 

 mella three-notched in the middle; area smooth, yellow-tinted in 

 the middle; lip-rib weakly crenulate, a small denticle near its 

 upper end.

This variety is like the typical form in the denticulation of 

 columella and lip. In var. hevilabris Pils. the lip-rib is smooth 

 throughout, and the columellar denticles very weak; these charac- 

 ters being constant in a large number of specimens. 



N. hellcinoides is apparently closely related to the small form of 

 N. striata Burrow described by Prof, von Martens in the hew edi- 

 tion of Chemnitz, p. 39, PI. 7, figs. 19, 20.

 orly. Sculpture of about 8 rather strong, almost smooth spiral 

 ribs above and upon the rounded peripheral region, with one or 

 several fine threads in some of the interspaces; 8 to 10 smaller, 

 closer smooth ribs upon the rather flattened base. Alt. hardly 4,

 small and in contact. Anterioi' end rounded, the slope above 

 straight; posterior slope straight or slightly convex, finely serrate; 

 the posterior end narrowly subrostrate and Ijiaugular, the right 

 valve having two prominent posterior keels, the space between them 

 concave, left valve with one posterior keel, a narrow furrow close 

 before it, with a slighter second depression, the basal margin well 

 rounded, ascending and sometimes slightly sinuous behind. Lunula 

 lanceolate, very deeply cut, bounded by acute ridges, that of the 

 right valve rising well above the left, and with a wider excavation. 

 Area also deeply excavated, bounded by keels, the ligament promi- 

 nent. Interior white, the hinge strong, with two cardinal teeth in 

 each valve, the left anterior tooth and the right posterior bifid. 

 Left valve without laterals, right valve with low, distant anterior 

 and posterior lateral teeth. Hinge-line straight behind the beak, 

 concave in front. Pallial sinus very large, reaching to within a 

 millimeter or two of the anterior adductor scar, confluent with the 

 pallial line below for about half its length. Scars of the cruciform 

 muscle distinct.

Inland Sea of Japan. Tyi^es No. 71,029 Coll. A. N. S. P. 



This species is closely related to T. pristis Lam. and T. concen- 

 trica Gld. It has a wider lunule tlian the former, its bounding 

 keels without the irregularity, "saw" or serration seen in T. 

 pristis. The posterior area is more deeply excavated, the posterior 

 keel of the right valve is stronger, and the end is much more bent 

 to the right. The hinge-plate is wider, and the anterior lateral 

 tooth is further removed from the cardinals. Finally, the dorsal 

 slopes are steeper, meeting at a smaller angle, and hence the whole 

 outline is more triangular. In T. concentrica Gld. (Fiji Islands) 

 the form is more elongate, the lunule and posterior area far less 

 impressed, and the interior is more glossy, with shallower, less dis- 

 tinct muscular scars, and the shell is thinner. T. diaphana Desh. 

 differs by having the pallial sinus abut against the anterior adduc- 

 tor scar, according to Deshayes' description. T. damensls v. 

 Martens is a longer, less high species, by the description. It has 

 not been figured, so far as I can learn, and is doubtfully distinct 

 from T. diaphana Desh.

 obtusely subangular in front. Sculpture of slight, rather irregular 

 growth-stnaa, a strong lens showing some almost obsolete spiral stri^ 

 near the umbilicus. Aperture oblique, short-oval, almost round 

 a little excised by the parietal wall. Peristome thin, narrowly 

 expanded and subreflexed. Alt. 6.2, ,liam. 9 mm.; width of 

 umbilicus about 1 mm. 



Anaya, Awaji Island (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 643) 

 This form is duller, more conoidal, with the last whorl more 

 depressed than T yoodwini var. kyoloensis. It is smaller than 

 T. dacoda, with the aperture less rounded. It is the first TrU- 

 hophta known from Awaji Island. 

 Trishoplita goodwini var, strigata nov. 



Shell similar in general characters to T. goodwini, but rather 

 faintly streaked obliquely with brown on a whitish corneous 

 ground, usually whitish below the suture. Finely oblinuelv 

 striate, and dcmely decussate by close spirals. Whorls 5^ to 6

 Ihis form was recognized as somewhat different from the typical T. 

 goodwim of Hondo, when received from Mr. Hirase about a 'year 

 ago; but I did not then think it desirable to distinguish it by 

 name. Since such forms of good^cuu as tosanu and dacostce have 

 bee*! so distinguished, it would seem advisable to recognize this 

 also._ Upon the whole, it is well to have names for these sub- 

 species, which have become differentiated in various areas of the 

 empire T. goodwini var. strigata differs from tosana and dacostc 

 oy its decussate surface.

 strong basal keel around the umbilicus. Aperture slightly

Shell pale amber tinted or corneous, glossy, similar to B. striatula

 stronger; 3 or 4 large and irregularly spaced ones above the peri- 

 phery, those on the base smaller and closer. Alt. 10 (specimens

Specimens from Osaka have less strong sculpture than those from 

 the province Hidachi, though it is still stronger than in any Chinese 

 specimens of B. striatula in the series before me. The peristome 

 is rather less expanded, too, though well thickened in adults, and 

 either black (Manabe) or pale (Osaka). B. striatula has already 

 been reported from Japan by Prof, von Martens," who in 1660 

 found it at Yokohama, on the muddy bank of the small river, at 

 the first bridge, in quite fresh water. I suppose it wa.s this strongly 

 sculptured form wliich he found. The Vega Expedition collected 

 shells identified by Westerlund as B. striatula at Jokogava (near 

 Tokyo), and at Lake Biwa {Verja Exp., IV, p. 182). In China 

 the species is widely diSused, from the Yangtse to the Amur drain- 

 ages; and Pere Heude" has split it into some four species. Of

these his B. chinoisis seems to me to be typical B. driatula. while B. 

 spiralis is a more slender, B. scalaris a stouter form, perhaps not 

 more than varietally distinct. B. striatula Bens, of Heude is a 

 strongly keeled form, certainly not the typical striatula of Benson. 

 His identification of it was possibly due to a remark of von Mar- 

 tens in Jahrb. D. Mai. Ges., II, 1875, p. 133. 



I have no great faith iu the distinctness of any of these sup- 

 posed species ; but if several Chinese forms are to be distinguished, 

 the Japanese shells evidently deserve at least varietal rank. They 

 are nearer B. striatula Heude non Benson than to any other of 

 the Chinese varieties.

 deeply eroded iu adults. Interior whitish, or light violet outside 

 of the pallial line. Hinge rather narrow, the cardinal teeth 

 slightly grooved at their summits ; anterior and posterior laterals of 

 equal length, single in the left, double in the right valve. Length 

 33, ale. 27, diam. 18 mm. 



Sado, Japan (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



It fiUs me with sadness to add another Corbicula to the Japanese 

 fauna, but these specimens cannot without violence be referred to 

 any of those known. C. marteiisl Clessiu is perhaps the nearest, 

 but sadoemii is more transverse, the lateral teeth diverge at a wider 

 angle, and the striffi are far closer. The very close, comparatively 

 fine striation is the chief differential character of the species, 

 distinguishing it from all the other forms. 



Corbicula awajiensis n. sp. 



Shell oval, compressed, the diameter about half and the alt. 

 three-fourths the length, bright yellowish green, with buff spots 

 and patches toward the beaks; strongly and regularly ribbed con- 

 centrically. Beaks rather low, not projecting much, eroded and 

 deep violet. Nearly equilateral, the anterior end sometimes slightly 

 narrower, the two ends about equally rounded, upper and lower 

 margins equally and similarly curved. Interior dark violet, with 

 a darker, often light-bordered spot uuder the beaks. Hinge deli- 

 cate, the cardinal teeth small; anterior and posterior laterals of 

 about equal length, somewhat curved, very strongly crenulate, 

 double in the right, single in the left valve. Length 16, alt. 12, 

 diam. 8^ mm. 



Noda, Awaji (Mr. Y. Hirase). 



The valve-margins viewed from within are seen to form a sym- 

 metrical oval figure, the upper and lower borders having almost 

 exactly the same curvature, and the anterior and posterior ends 

 being about equal. There is no suggestion of the subtriangular 

 shape of most Japanese species of Corbicula. The beaks are low 

 and the sculpture strong and regular. It is a small species, the 

 first known from Awaji Island, and seems quite distinct from any 

 other.

THE LAND MOLLUSKS OF THE LOO CHOO ISLANDS: CLATJSILIID^. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



Seven or eight years ago, at the time of my first studies upon 

 Japanese moUusks, ouly two species of Cloiusilla were known from 

 the Loo Choo Islands: C. valida Pfeiffer,' described from speci- 

 mens collected by Largilliert, and C. p neclara Govdd,' collected by 

 William Stimpson, naturalist of the U. S. North Pacific Explor- 

 ing Expedition, under Commandei"s Ringgold and Rodgers. 



Mr. Frederick Stearns brought a third species, taken on Oki- 

 nawa, which I described in 1894 as C. Stearitsii,' and a fourth was 

 sent in 1900 by j\Ir. Hirase, C. hijperoptyx,* from the same 

 island. 



Two other species, C. Bernardii Pfr. and C. ptychochila Bttg., 

 supposed to be from Siam and China respectivel}', seem from their 

 characters to be so near Loo Chooan species that I think their 

 formerly assigned habitats were probably erroneous, and that both 

 really came from the Loo Choo Islands. Acting upon this 

 hypothesis, I provisionally include them in the following account. 



Through the researches conducted by my esteemed correspondent, 

 Mr. Y. Hirase, the number of species known from these beautiful 

 and interesting islands has now been increased to eleven,'* not 

 counting the two species of doubtful provenance alluded to above. 



Up to this time we have received species from only three islands : 

 Yayeyama in the southwestern group, Okinawa or Great Luchu in 



' Zeitschi-.f. Malak., 1819, p. 106 ; 3Io>i. Eel. Viv., Ill, p. 591. Kuster, 

 Conchyl. Cab., Olausilia, PI. 23, figs. 1-3, figures of PfeiSer's tvpe. 



- Proc. Bost. Soc. ma. Hut., VI, p. 425, February, 1859 ; Otic. Conch., p. 

 103. The name prmclara being preoccupied in Olausilia, Pfeifi'er changed 

 it to 0. cvedlens, Jour, de Coiichi/l., p. 268 (1861), basing the new name 

 on Gould's description. 



^Nautilus, VIII, p. 47 (August, 1894); Oatal. Mar. Moll. Jap., Appen- 

 dix, p. 163, Pi. 1, fig. 12. 



* These Proeeeduigs, 1900, p. 446, PI. XIV, figs. 12-14. 



* This includes the species of Oshima, as this island belongs both geo- 

 graphically and faunally to the Loo Choo group. Being politically a part of 

 Kagoshima Kon or prefecture, it is not usually considered by the Japanese 

 to be one of the Loo Choo group, which in ordinary p:irlance includes merely 

 the Central and Further groups of islands, belonging to Okinawa Ken. 




410 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Julv, 



the central group, aud Oshima iu the northeastern group. There 

 can be no doubt that when other islands are explored many more 

 species will be brought to light, and our zoogeographic knowledge 

 correspond ingly ex panded . 



The known species fall into five subgenera or sections: Stereo- 

 phcedma, Luchuphxdusa, Hemiphcedusa, Tyraimophcediisa (f) and 

 Zaptyx. Of these, the section Luchuphadusa, comprising about 

 half the species now known, has been found nowhere but on these 

 islands. Zaptyx extends into the southernmost provinces of 

 Kiusiu, in the neighborhood of Kagoshima Bay; and probably 

 borne by the " Kuro Shi wo " has reached Hachijo, an islet a 

 hundred miles off Izu province; but a Loo Chooan origin of the 

 group seems probable. Stereopluedma and Hemiphcedusa range 

 further, being common throughout Japan, and the latter group is 

 widespread on the Chinese mainland ; but the species of the Loo 

 Choo Islands belong to a special group of Hemiphaxlasa which has 

 not been found elsewhere. The single species referred doubtfully 

 to Tyraimophcedusa has no close relatives, but seems nearer t» 

 Japanese than to any Chinese species known to me. The sections 

 Euphcedusa and Mfigalophcedusa, so characteristic of Japan, are 

 wanting in the Loo Choos, so far as present information goes; and 

 Reinia has not been found. So much for the distribution of the 

 groups. Descending to species, we find not one common to the Loo 

 Choo Islands and any other land. 



The general affinities of the Clausilia fauna, we may conclude, 

 are closest with Japan, though the endemic element is so strong 

 that no relationship at all intimate can be claimed. No character- 

 istic Formosan forms of Clausilia have been found iu the Loo 

 Choo group. 



Section STEREOPH^EDUSA Bttg. 



Clausilia valida I'i'r. 



Originally described from the " Liew Kiew " Islands, this 

 species is known from Okinawa Island only. It has lieen collected 

 there by the Japanese collectors sent by Dr. Adolph Fritze in 

 1891, by Mr. Frederick Stearns about the same time, and has also 

 been taken by Mr. Hirase's collector. The typical form is uniform 

 brownish yellow. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 411 



The chestnut-banded form with the coarse sculpture of the type 

 has been named var. faseiata by Mr. E. R. Sykes.'' 



Anotlier Ijanded variety may be called var. perfaseiata. It is 

 similar to C. valida fasciata Sykes, but larger, the broad jnirple- 

 brown band more strongly contrasted with the whitish or pale buff 

 bands above and below it; aperture longer, more piriform. The 

 sculpture is perceptibly finer than in valida. The types of this 

 form are from the province Kunchan, Okinawa Island (No. 633 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection). 



A third form of the species, var. strkdelki, nov., has the color- 

 ing of var. fasciata, but darker on the last two whorls, with the 

 same rather wide aperture, dusky purplish within ; but the surface 

 is far more finely striated, there being fully twice as many strire as 

 there are in valida. The size is about the same. 



Length 28, diam. 6 mm., 7 J whorls remaining. 



Length 25i, diam. 6;\ mm., 6^ whorls remaining. 



The types 'are 79,116 Coll. A. N. S. P., from -462 of Mr. 

 Hirase's collection, labeled " Loo Choo." 



Clausilia Stearnsii Pilsbry. 



The types were taken on Okinawa by the collector sent by Mr. 

 Frederick Stearns in 1891-2. They measure, length 26 to 31, 

 diam. 5 mm. Specimens sent this year from Yayeyama by Mr. 

 Hirase (No. 622) measure 26-28 by 5 mm. Others sent from 

 " Loo Choo" are more slender, length 25-25i, diam. 4^ mm., 

 with 12 whorls and a less distinct lunella than the types. 



C. Stearnsii is very distinct by its receding inferior lamella and 

 the development of a lunella, both being characters unlike most 

 other species of Stereophcedusa. 



Section LUCHUPH^DUSA nov. 



Clausilium wide, truncate or notched distally, and with a thick- 

 ened lobe or finger-like process on the columellar side of the apex, 

 standing at nearly a right angle with the body of the plate. 



Shell fusiform, the right margin of the peristome usually crenate, 

 outer margin excavated above to form a sinulus; superior lamella 

 marginal, projecting, continuous with the long spiral lamella; 



* The Oonchologist, II, p. 118. Figure 52 of Sowerby's monograph in'the 

 Concholorjia Iconica, XX, evidently is intended to represent one of the 

 specimens mentioned by Jlr. Sykes. 




412 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [<Tuly, 



inferior lamella strongly spiral within, calloused below ; subcolu- 

 mellar lamella dilated adjacent to the very long and strong lower 

 palatal plica, which is united with the lunella, when that is pres- 

 ent; principal plica long; upper palatal plica developed, sometimes 

 coaleseent with the lunella. 



The shell in this section is similar to that of the group of C. 

 ptychochila in general characters, but differs in the dilation of the 

 subcolumellar lamella and in the much higher, simple spiral plate 

 of the inferior lamella within the last whorl. Like the group 

 mentioned, its peculiarities are an exaggeration of the platydera 

 group of Hemiphcedasa, which may be looked upon as a sort of 

 unspeciahzed branch of the common stock. The clausilium, bow- 

 ever, is so peculiar and unlike any Phoedusoid group hitherto 

 known, that the erection of a new section is required. The 

 lamellifi and plicre are all very strongly developed within, and the 

 former are unusually long, passing the ventral position. 



Luchuphcedusa has much in common with the section Emargina- 

 ria Bttg. of the German upper Miocene, in which a similar emar- 

 ginate or notched clausilium and the same interlamellar plication is 

 developed; but the Miocene forms retain a primitive structure of 

 the palatal region, where several plic;e are developed, while Luchu- 

 phiedma is verj' highly specialized there. The resemblance is par- 

 tially due to convergent evolution. 



Key to species of Luchuphcedusa, by external characters.

Shell thick and strong, pale brown , or green from adhering algffi, 

 rimate, turreted, the upper third of the length attenuated, with 

 slightly concave outlines, the lower two-thirds rather swollen, the 

 penultimate whorl widest, the last half of the last whorl contracted, 

 compressed laterally. The apex is obtuse. Whorls Hi, the early 

 ones worn smooth, the rest closely rib-striate, the riblets on the last

 regular. Aperture vertical, rhombic-piriforin, with distinct sinulus, 

 the peristome expanded and reflexed, thick, white, the left margin 

 wide and thick as far up as the sinulus, where it is abruptly exca- 

 vated; right margin, from the superior lamella to the base, deeply out 

 into rounded entering lurinkles, which deeply crenulate the lip-edge. 

 Superior lamella subvertical, rather thick, emerging to the margin, 

 continuous with the high, long and strongly developed spiral 

 lamella. Inferior lamella subhorizontal, strongly approaching the 

 superior lamella within, heavy, not reaching the lip-margin, very

 edge, where it forms one of the series of lip-folds. Principal plica 

 strong and nearly a whorl long, reaching nearly to the lip; extend- 

 ing inward far beyond the lunella. Upper palatal plica long, con- 

 verging inwardly toward the principal plica ; lunella short and very 

 obliquely running inward, arising below from a very strong and 

 high, angularly bent, long, loxuer ixilatal plica. 



Clausilium (PI. XXII, fig. 4) broad, irregularly curved, 

 abruptly truncate below, slightly thickened along the i>alatal mar-

 cal, semicircular in general contour, obtusely angular at the sinulus 

 and at the foot of the columella; the inner margin being straight- 

 ened, the outer rounded. Peristome white, the outer and "basal 

 margins flaring, broadly reflexed, the inner margin sloping, emar- 

 ginate at the termination of the .superior lamella, arcuate along 

 ihe interlamellar space, then straightened. Superior lamella 

 strong, slightly oblique, marginal, continuous with the spiral 

 lamella. Inferior lamella very strong, calloused and thick, forming 

 a squarish columellar fold, abruptly lower or sometimes bifid where 

 it extends upon the peristome. Subcolumellar lamella emerging, 

 very strong and prominent, extending to the lip-edge. Principal 

 plica about one-third of a whorl long, lateral in position. Luuella 

 arcuate, its upper end curving well inward (being completely united 

 with, and curving into, a short upper palatal plica); below, the 

 lunella becomes strong and high, and joins the middle of an cx- 

 tremelv strong, long, arched lower palatal fold, the summit of which 

 curves downward and almost meets a broad, erect plate which at 

 this point rises from the subcolumellar lamella. The lower end of 

 the lower palatal plica is visible from the aj)erture, in a front or 

 slightly oblique view. Tlie inferior lamella is continued inward as 

 a strongly spiral erect plate, rather distant from the spiral lamella 

 on the dorsal side, but approaching it and becoming rather abruptly 

 lower ventrally, both penetrating to beyond the middle of the ven- 

 tral side. The subcolumellar lamella inward from the expansion 

 toward the lower palatal plica, is slightly sigmoid, and not parallel 

 inside with the inferior lamella.

 having a shallow pit behind the middle of the outer lip, rounded 

 at the base. Aperture ear-shaped, oblique, produced in a deep 

 retracted sbiulus above. Peristome reflexed, thickened, a slight 

 ridge running behind the outer lip parallel with it; outer lip 

 obtusely toothed at the termination of the principal plica, thin 

 above, rather broad below the tooth. Inner lip projecting in the 

 middle, cut Into six or eight rounded, unequal interlamellar folds, 

 and similarly or more weakly crenate to or below the subcolumellar 

 lamella. Superior lamella vertical, emerging beyond the general 

 level of the peristome, continuous with the spiral lamella. Infe- 

 rior lamella very prominently projecting into the aperture, subhori- 

 zontal and somewhat thickened below. Subcolumellar lamella 

 wholly immersed, but replaced on the lip by rugse occupying ite 

 place. Principal plica very long, reaching to the liji and running 

 inward over a whorl; very strong. Upper palatal plica short, 

 weak and lateral; lower palatal plica very strong and long, its 

 lower end visible within the aperture, in an obUque view. Lunella 

 apparently wanting. Within, the inferior lamella is a very high, 

 strongly but somewhat irregularly spiral plate; the spiral lamella 

 is also very high, almost touching the principal plica; and both 

 lamellas penetrate far past the ventral side. The subcolumellar la- 

 mella is short as usual, but strong near its deeply immersed lower end.

The clausilium (PI. XXII, figs. 12, 13, 14) is strongly curved 

 below, and becomes very thick toward the apex. The distal end 

 lias two apices separated by a notch, the outer one conic and 

 rather broad, the inner blunt and bent nearly at a right angle wiih 

 the body of the plate. 



Nase, Oshima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 653a). 



This exceedingly peculiar species has the crenulate right lip of 

 most of its group, but it differs from all known species except the 

 next in the great development of the posterior bay or " sinulus " 

 of the ajierture. It is difficult to gain a correct conception of the 

 closing appai'atus, so contracted is the cavity of the last whorl 

 by the enormously developed lamella; and plica;. The deeply 

 immersed subcolumellar lamella is a prominent feature, differentiating 

 C. oshimce from C. pseudoshimce ; but as I have remarked above, 

 this is ma^lied by the sulcation of the lip, by which rounded 

 lamellfB are produced in the subcolumellar position. 



Clausilia pseudoshimae n. sp. ri. XXII, flgs. 7, s, 9, 10. 



Shell very similar externally to C. oshimce; a little smaller; 

 aperture and lip the same, except that the subcolumellar lamella 

 emerges to the liu-edge. Internal structure the same, except that 

 the spiral trend of the inferior lamella, as seen from the back in 

 an opened shell, is made irregular by two prominent angles; there is 

 a rather long, latero-dorsal, upper palatal plica opposite the great 

 lateral dilation of the inferior lamella. The very long lower 

 palatal plica gives off a very short and extremehj oblique lunella 

 in a ventral position, where the clausilium lodges. The clausilium 

 (PI. XXII, fig. 11) has two subequal blunt apical points, sepa- 

 rated by a rather wide notch.

Strikingly like C. oshimoi in general aspect, yet readily distin- 

 guishable by a number of important interna) characters. On 

 cutting the shell it is found to be decidedly less strong than in the 

 other species. The clausilium lodges in a ventral position. The 

 form of the basal lip is poorly represented in fig. 8. The other 

 figures show it correctly.

Shell small, fusiform, rather obese, but rapidly tapering and 

 conspicuously attenuated above; thin and not very strong, pale 

 brown, deQsely and finely rib-striate. Whorls 8^ to 9, convex, 

 the apex rather large, next three or four whorls widening but 

 little; last half of the last whorl much contracted, flattened. 

 Aperture somewhat oblique, small, piriform, with moderately well- 

 defined sinulus. Peristome reflexed, slightly thickened, the outer 

 margin excavated above, the upper and right margins more or less 

 crenulate, the creuulation varying from strong to subobsolete in 

 different specimens. Superior lamella vertical, emerging a little 

 beyond the general level of the peristome, slightly wider or bifid 

 at the margin; continuous with the spiral lamella. Inferior 

 lamella forming a rather strong subhorizontal fold within, not 

 emerging to the peristome. Subcolumellar lamella emerging, 

 marginal. Principal plica about a half whorl long, extending 

 from the dorsal to the middle of the ventral side. Upper palatal 

 plica lateral, arcuate, converging inward toward the principal 

 plica, the outer end contiguous to the lunella, the upper end of 

 which curves toward and is almost united with it. Lunella lateral 

 in position, oblique, weak above, strong below, where it unites 

 with the middle of a long, very strong and angularly bent lower 

 palatal plica. The subcolumellar lamella is abruptly and strongly 

 dilated in the region of the lower palatal plica, and is bent over 

 toward it; beyond this dilation it curves abruptly and ascends the 

 internal column in the usual manner, expands again and turns 

 toward the right, parallel to the other lamellw upon the roof of 

 the penultimate whorl. The inferior lamella within the last 

 whorl is stout, high, very strongly spiral, and with the spiral 

 lamella continues inward past the ventral side, upon which the 

 three lamellas run parallel.

In this group the right lip or interlamellar space is more or less 

 crenate; the superior and subcolumellar lamellre are marginal, the 

 inferior lamella somewhat receding, thickened below, strongly sig- 

 moid wilhiu, and in the middle of the dorsal aspect it is low, wide 

 and bifid, as if composed of two cords twisted round one another. 

 The lower palatal plica is very strong, elevated in the middle where 

 the lunella joins it, the latter being very strong below, weak above. 

 The clausilium (PI. XXIII, figs. 26-29) is wider in the middle 

 than in Hemiphmdusa, tapering above and below, strongly curved 

 toward the thickened, obtuse apex, and with the lateral margins 

 bent nearly at right angles with the rest of the plate, forming a 

 sort of spout-like distal extremity (PL XXIII, figs. 27, 28). 



This group is probal)ly entitled to separate sectional rank. It is 

 related to the Japanese group of C. phdydem, but differs in the 

 form of the inferior lamella within the last whorl, and in the 

 clausilium.

excellens. The species was known to Pfeiffer by Gould's descrip- 

 Through the kindness of Prof. William H. Dall I am 

 able to give a figure of the type specimen, from 

 Loo Choo, in the National Museum. 



It differs from C. crenilabium in the slightly 

 stronger striation and the better development of the 

 interlamellar crenulation; and from C. crenilabium, 

 ptychochild and Beniardil in the grooving of the 

 top of the inferior lamella, ^phif',]l is almost bifid. 

 In C. crenilabium and C. Bernardii the inferior la- 

 mella is only bifid far within, iu a dorsal position, 

 as shown in PI. XXIII, fig. 2.5. In C. excellens 

 this bifid structure has apparently moved downward 

 to the lower end of the lamella. 



The clausilium of C. excellens is still unknown, 

 as the type specimen has not been opened ; and the 



subgeneric position of the species cannot, therefore, be considered 



certain. It may possibly be a Lucliujjhcedusa. 



Group of C. munvs. 



A group of uncertain systematic position, probably referable to 

 Th/rannophcediuia rather than to Hemiphadusa ; but more material 

 and further study is needed to determine to what extent Hemi- 

 pluulusa is heterogeneous, and how it may best be subdivided. 

 The heavy thickening cf the distal end of the clausilium on the 

 columellar side, and its short form, remove the s])ecies described 

 below from llemiphcedusa, but it differs from the typical forms 

 of Tijrannopluedma in the comparatively few-whorled shell and 

 in details of the palatal armature.

A STUDY OF AN ANT. 



» 

 BY ADELE M. FIELDE, 



The colonies of Sfenamma (Aphcenor/asfer^ fuhnun Mayr, sub- 

 species aquira Buckley, variety pleeum Emery, a Myrmicid ant 

 iound commonly in the neighborhood of Wood's Hole have varied 

 in the numbers of their inmates from a few individuals to many 

 thousands. The nests are near the surface, in mellow soil, by 

 roadsides, in meadows, and in woods, and are usually near, among, 

 or under loose stones. ' 



' Unless otherwise indicated the auts under observation were kept In the 

 portable nests described by the author in Vol. 2, No. 2, of the Biological 

 Bulletin. The species mentioned in this paper were identified for the 

 writer by Prof. William Jloiton Wheeler, of the University of Te.xas. 

 The colonies under inspection were kept at the Marine Biological Labora- 

 tory at Wood's Hole, JIass., from July to the end of September, 1900, 

 and in New York City from tlien until the tirst of June, 1901, when 

 they were carried back to Wood's Hole. The temperature of the room 

 in which the}' were kept in New York varied from 40^ to 90^ F., or 5^ 

 to 3.5-' C, and this variation often occurred during single days. The 

 word diiy is used throughout this narrative as representiug a period of 

 twenty-four hours' duration. The use of Petri double-dishes in the study of 

 living ants was suggested to the author by Prof. Wheeler. Those referred 

 to in this study were about 100 millimeters in diameter and 10 mm. deep on 

 the inside. The cell formed by the double dish was set upon a disk of card- 

 board, covered with white Turkish towelling, to which a tiny patch of black 

 silk was attached. The Petri cell was set upon this disk, which was wider 

 than itself, and the cell was covered with another disk of thick dark blotting 

 paper. Within the cell were two sections of very fine-meshed sponge about 

 6 mm. thick, covering one-third the floor of the cell, and so placed as to leave 

 a passageway for the ants between the sponge and the cell-wall, and also a 

 triangular space where the ants could settle between the sponges and above 

 the black patch. The sponges were kept saturated with water, to give drink 

 to the ants and moisture to the air, and to prevent the hiding of the eggs in 

 the interstices of the sponge. Care was taken that the sponges should not 

 overflow and inundate the young. 



Particles of food, from three to six kinds, known to be acceptable to the 

 ants, were constantly provided, and laid on that part of the floor farthest 

 from the sponges. 'The air, the water, and the food were kept always fresh 

 and clean. The sponges were dipped in alcohol and well rinsed once a 

 week. 



The cells were set upon the shelve? of a dark, well-aired cupboard, with the 

 food-side of the cell toward the source of light. Not more than seven auts 

 were permanently housed in a single cell. Among the ants kept several 

 months in this manner there were scarcely any deaths from natural causes. 




426 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



The workers are brown in their general color, and are from four 

 to seven millimeters in length, and, although they are apparently 

 alike in all except size, they are here referred to as majors, minors 

 and minims, the majors being from six to seven millimeters long, 

 the minors from five to six, and the minims from four to five. 

 AVlAp the colony moves the majors do the main part of the work 

 of transporting the inert young, and they often seize, hft and 

 carry to the new abode such ants as adhere too persistently to the 

 old habitation. The minors appear to do a large part of the scout- 

 iag and purveying. The minims are greatly devoted to the care of 

 the eggs, larva? and pup;e. All assiduously serve the queen, and 

 all engage in battles with enemies. 



The queens are from seven to eight millimeters in length without 

 their wings, and .are redder than the workers. The king^ are 

 from six to seven millimeters long, with the wings projecting 

 another millimeter beyond the end of the body, and are jet black 

 in color. 



The workers are efficient fighters, and at close quarters will kill 

 Formica fusea, double their bulk. They evince extreme hostil- 

 ity not only to ants of other species, but to those of other or alien 

 colonies of their own species and variety. In this paper the term 

 alien is used to denote a different colony of the same species and 

 variety. Queens of different colonies, when placed together in a nest 

 or a Petri cell, ostracize each other, remaining as far apart as possible. 

 If forced into close quarters, they interlock mandibles and push 

 and pull one another until one dies. An alien queen, introduced 

 into and unable to flee from a queenless colony, is attacked by its 

 workers, and though she may make a brave fight, is eventuallj' 

 killed. When a queen is alone she will sometimes fight in defense 



and after a day or two of quiet residence in this abode they showed 

 little disposition to leave it, but carried on their normal occupations with 

 an appearance of contentrjcnt. 



In cleaning the cell, the cover was gently removed in a dim light, the left 

 hand was placed snugly over the part of tUe cell occupied by the ant family, 

 and the ants stayed in the agreeable warmth and darkness thus provided for 

 them while the uniiccu))ied part of the cell w;is cleaned. By externally 

 covering .any portion of the cell floor with the black patch, and setting the 

 cell in a dim light, the ants were made to move to the selected site without 

 serious disturbance or loss of eggs. , 



For prolonged ol)servation of the ants I n^ed a weak light, natural or 

 artiticial, hand lenses, and a background, under the glass lloor, of whatever 

 color best showed the object.

of her eggs, larvje aud pupte; but if there be workers belonging 

 to her, she retires to a place of safety, and remains there until the 

 fracas subsides and the workers seek her out. 



Workers from different colonies shut into the same nest will fight 

 until liut one party remains. I put into a Janet nest, which one 

 colony had occupied for a week, another colony that had for two 

 weeks been in a Lubbock nest. The following day the Lubbock 

 colony was congregated with a mass of its young in three stages 

 in the food-room; the Janet colony was likewise congregated with 

 its young in the adjoining nursery, and a battle was raging between 

 ■groups of two, of three, of four and of five, the attacks being 

 always upon single ants. A day later eighty ants had been slain, 

 and the warfare continued. On the fifth day the young of both 

 colonies had all been brought together into the nursery aud the 

 victorious remnant of the Janet colony was alone with its spoils. 



When a single alien Steiiamma fulvum piceum is introduced into 

 a colony, it at once exhibits signs of terror, endeavors to flee or to 

 hide, and keeps apart from the habitants; but sooner or later an 

 inmate comes upon it, and though it may slay its opponent in a 

 due! or two, it is sure to be destroyed, as no Stenamma fulvum 

 piceum code of honor intervenes against an attack of many upon 

 one. 



Long-continued isolation does not abate the hostility of Sien- 

 amma fulvum piceum to an alien. I have tried many experiments 

 with queens that had lived solitary for several months, introducing 

 to their respective domiciles alien workers of all ages, from loag 

 mature adults to callows just beginning to walk, and I have but 

 rarely succeeded in effecting a reconciliation between the two. 

 The hostility of the worker to the queen was usually as marked as 

 was that of the queen to the worker. The few cases iu which 

 affiliation was induced were all between the queen and very young 

 callows, whose impudence appears sometimes to be condoned by 

 their elders. An instance of this toleration was given by a queen 

 and one major worker that had been isolated in a Petri cell for 

 more than three months. After killing several older callows, 

 introduced one by one, they had permitted an alien minim, intro- 

 duced when but a few hours old, to remain with them. Five days 

 later I introduced two sisters of their adopted young worker, the 

 newcomers being minims about twenty days old. These newcomers

at once attacked the queen and the major. The major acted solely 

 ou the defensive. Curliasr her abdomen in, and sitting on the 

 small of her back, -with her tough thorax presented to her small 

 enemy, she permitted much nabbing of her body and much pulling 

 of her limbs, making no retaliation. The queen, on her part, 

 caught her little adversary by its antenna and held it firmly and 

 quietly for some minutes, then released it and stood head to head 

 with it without nipping it. The whole conduct of the adults was 

 like that often seen in big dogs that are playing with obstreperous 

 puppies. It appeared as if the adults liked their adopted callow 

 and were unwilling to harm its sisters. The three callows perfectly 

 affiliated from the start; but the newcomers often renewed their 

 attacks on the queen and the major, and after some hours were 

 killed by the adults The adopted callow continued to live in 

 that cell. 



The kings of different colonies are indifferent or friendly to one 

 another, and they have no steady foes either in their own or other 

 households of their kind. They are the only active representatives 

 of their colony that are ever cordially received in any other colony, 

 and strong inducements are apparently oflered for their permanent 

 residence among the aliens. I have seen two workers, one on either 

 side of an alien king, holding to his wings and gently conducting 

 him through the grass to the entrance of their domicile; and I have 

 repeatedly seen the workers capture, lift and carry alien kings 

 home with them. If, about swai-raiug time, an alien king is 

 dropped into one of my glass nests, the workers seize him by his 

 wings and forcibly detain him among them. If he later wanders 

 away, they follow, lift and bring him back. The kings are much 

 petted by the workers; their bodies are licked clean, their wings 

 are straightened and smoothed, and their heads are patted with the 

 antennas. If the colony is forced to change its place of residence 

 the kings are picked up by the small of the back and carried to 

 the new abode. Young winged queens manifest great friendliness 

 toward alien kings. Probably cross-fertilization is common if not 

 universal. 



Stenamma fulcuin jnccum oi the same colony, queens, kings and 

 workers, generally live amicably together. The queen is followed, 

 tended, licked and patted, and is the evi<lent centre of attraction 

 in the group.

Colonies captured and confined in my nests just before swarming 

 time, within a few days divided into as many groups as there were 

 queens, the queens disposing themselves as far apart as the hmits 

 of the nest permitted. When a queen was then removed by me, 

 the workers at once carried the young and settled down by another 

 queen. 



A wingless queen, after wandering for some days alone in a 

 Lubbock nest, cleared an irregularly oval space about three ceuti- 

 meters long and two centimeters wide, building a smooth solid wall 

 with the particles of earth that she removed from her floor. The 

 wall was compact and vertical, and for more than half the circum- 

 ference of the structure extended a distance of five millimeters 

 from the floor to the glass roof. She worked industriously for 

 several days on this structure and then laid an egg, which she 

 lifted and carried between her mandibles whenever light was 

 admitted to her dwelling. The day after the laying of the first 

 egg, a visitor lifted the glass roof of the nest and spoiled her 

 work. I then marked her, using a fine camel' s-hair brush and 

 dotting the top of her abdomen with a fleck of quickly drying 

 varnish into which water colors had been rubbed, and I then re- 

 turned her to her own colony, from which she had been absent 

 three weeks. The first worker that she there met stood head to 

 head with her for some minutes, while the two tapped each other 

 with antenna? and the worker regurgitated food to the queen. 

 Other ants greeted her with the same ordinary signs of satisfaction. 

 Nine queens taken on their emergence from the nest at swarmin^ 

 in September and placed in Petri cells, each vnth an alien king, 

 retained their wings from two to three months, aud only one of 

 them laid eggs before shedding her wings. One of my queens shed 

 her wings the day she was caj)tured, and another retained hers 

 nearly four months. One laid her first egg twenty-seven davs 

 after swarming in September, and one laid no eggs until Januarv, 

 one hundred and six days after swarming. Noue of the score of 

 queens that I have isolated at their swarming with alien kings has 

 failed sooner or later to lay eggs. 



The eggs are deposited one at a time, without regularity in the 

 intervals. Only once have I known so many as six to be deposited 

 in a single day, one or two a day being the ordinary number. If 

 the queen is agitated or troubled she ceases from egg-laying, some- 




430 PEOCEEDIXGSj OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



limes for many days together. Some of the queens in my Petri 

 cells have averaged more than one egg a day during every month 

 from September to the following July, and they and their workers 

 appear to be in good health, though they have had during the 

 winter no respite from the labor of rearing the young. 



The esrars laid bv the queens are visible to the unassisted eve, are 

 a pearly translucent white, and are oblong in shape, the thickness 

 being about half the length, which is half a millimeter. When 

 the queen is about to deposit an egg, workers stand about her, as 

 if aware of a new duty, and they pick up the egg as soon as it is 

 deposited and add it to the packet, which is constantly tended, 

 kept clean, watched over and carried about by the workers. The 

 egg-packet, after being carried about for some time by one worker, 

 is passed over to another, who appears to assume the burden 

 eagerly. If the queen is alone she takes care of her own eggs. 



In order to ascertain the time of incubation, I placed queens 

 each in a clean Petri cell, some with workers, some without workers, 

 and cleaned each cell daily until the first egg was deposited in it. 

 I examined the cell two or three times a day, and recorded the 

 time of deposit of the first egg and of a few succeeding ones. In 

 some cases I removed the queen after a few eggs had been depos- 

 ited, leaving the eggs to the care of the workers alone. I counted 

 the eggs daily to see that there was no diminution in their number, 

 and I cast out from my calculations all cases in which there was a 

 diminution of the number of eggs during the time of my observa- 

 tions. I was also careful that there should be no manipulation nor 

 disturbance of the eggs except b)- the ants themselves. The eggs 

 recorded were laid between the 7th of October and the 8th of the 

 following May, and were laid by ten different queens. Twenty- 

 two simultaneous or successive broods were thus observed, with the 

 result that in two cases the first larva appeared on the eighteenth 

 day after the laying of the first egg; in nine cases on the nine- 

 teenth day J in ten cases on the twentieth day; in one case on the 

 twenty-first day. The time of incubation was not influenced 

 solely by temperature, for eggs laid by different queens on the 

 same day did not invariably hatch on the same day. In six of 

 the twenty -two broods two eggs were deposited by the same queen 

 on the first day, and these six broods each produced its first two 

 larvte within the same day. Furthermore, the appearance of 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 431 



larvae succeeding the first in each brood corresponded closely with 

 the times of the deposit of eggs succeeding the first laid. Various 

 broods, removed to weak alcohol or hot water and examined under 

 a lens, showed the larva well formed in the egg at about the seven- 

 teenth day and no earlier. Broods in which the first larva 

 appeared on the nineteenth day were immersed in alcohol and 

 examined under a lens, and they always showed earlier, but never 

 later, stages of larval existence; while broods in which no larva 

 had appeared on the twentieth day showed, when examined in like 

 manner, a larva perfectly formed within the egg membrane. I 

 therefore conchide that the period of incubation varies between 

 seventeen and twenty -two days, with nineteen days as the common 

 period. The variation in the period of incubation bears no fixed 

 relation to the size of the future adult. Eggs of different periods 

 of incubation followed to the adult form were found to produce 

 the same sort of worker. 



My auts have furnished no evidence that they ever devour the 

 eggs, larv.-B or pupie of their own colony. One worker, isolated in 

 a Petri cell twenty-one days without food, died leaving five eggs 

 intact during the last sixteen days of her starvation. In all the 

 score of Petri cells in which I have for months watched the condi- 

 tion and counted the numbers of the eggs, no diminution of them 

 could be logically charged to the mature ants, whose skill and 

 diligence in keeping them clean, safe, dry and in humid darkness, 

 merits high renown. 



The feeding of the larva, which is bent nearly double in the 

 egg, with regurgitated food begins as soon as it straightens itself and 

 protrudes its mouth. When the larvie begin to appear in the egg- 

 pacKet, the workers lift the packet and hold it free and still, while 

 one of their number holds a translucent white globule of regurtji- 

 tated food to the larval mouth projecting from the surface of the 

 egg-packet. I have repeatedly seen the workers thus feeding the 

 very young larvte, a single globule of regurgitated food serving 

 for a meal of which four or five larvaj successively partook. 



When the larva first emerges, its length is nearly double that of 

 the egg. When well fed its growth is rapid and in a day or two 

 its length is three or four times that of the egg. When about 

 two millimeters long it is usually removed from I he egg-packet 

 and laid on the floor, or associated with others of its size in a 




432 PROCEEDI>^GS OF THE ACADEMY OP [July, 



separate huQcUe, the individuals being fastened together by the 

 hooks on their surfaces, as the eggs were by their sticky shells. 

 The habit which is observable in Stenamma fulvum ^jfeewm, 

 in commou with some other species of ants, of assorting the young 

 in accordance with the size and form, doubtless economizes labor 

 and also tends to the px-eservation of the young. The flexible neck 

 of the larva enables it to reach to a distance equal to a quarter of 

 its body-length, and to fix its mouth upon anything edible that is 

 within its reach. I have observed a gradual diminution of the- 

 eggs in every cell where the smalluess of the working force pre- 

 vented that segregation of the larvte and that assortment accord- 

 ing to size which prevails in large communities; and I have also, 

 in such circumstances, seen full-grown larv;e, and even pupaj, fall 

 victims to the voracity of the unfed younger larva?. 



The older larvse are often fed when lying upon their backs, the 

 ventral side serving as a place of deposit for food reached by the 

 curving of the neck, as described for Ponera coarctata by Prof. 

 Wheeler in the Biological Bidletin, Vol. 2, No. 2. Bat this 

 feeding posture is with Stenamma fulvum piceum scarcely more 

 common than are others. Sometimes one larva is used as a table, 

 not only for its own feeding, but for the feeding of two or three 

 other larvte that are inclined against its sides to take their portion 

 of the same morsel. I have also seen five larv:e set on end around 

 half the abdomen of a bisected house-fly, feeding voraciously from 

 its interior, like pigs around a trough. Sometimes the larva is 

 laid with its ventral side against a succulent portion of the insect, 

 and is left there to take its fill; sometimes it has a portion of meat 

 held to its mouth and forcibly removed as soon as it has had a 

 brief repast, and sometimes a worker stands with her head over 

 that of the larva and allows it to take food from her crop in a 

 manner resembling that in which a mother-pigeon feeds her young. 

 In my nests the very young larv;o have been fed solely upon regur- 

 gitated food. The older larv;e have been given particles of flies, 

 mealworms, roaches, beetles, spiders, sponge-cake, white bread 

 moistened with sweetened water, and of dried yolk of hens' eggs. 

 They have also fed upon fragments of ants of other species, on 

 pupre of alien colonies, and on the pupre and larvie of Creitutdogas- 

 ter lineohda and of Lasim lunbratus. 



Larvie deprived wholly of insect food did not during a period of 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 433 



one hundred days produce one pupa. But larvre grew from the 

 egg to nearly full size without insect food, and one pupa, that later 

 on became a minim, had no insect food during the last twenty-two 

 days of its larval stage. The adult ants appear able to live on 

 indefinitely without insect food ; but there is a noticeable diminu- 

 tion in the number of eggs laid by the queen, and in the number 

 of the larvte simultaneously fed by the workers. I have seen no 

 instance of the eating of members of their own colony by these 

 ants, nor of their feeding their larvte upon dismembered kin. But 

 they will eat and feed to their larvae the flesh of dismembered alien 

 callows, and probably thickness of integument is all that protects 

 aheu adults from being commonly used as food. 



The responsibility taken by the workers in the care of the 

 young may have brought about au incapacity on the part of some 

 of the queens to regurgitate food, and may have disabled them for 

 solitary rearing of the larvie. 



Two sister queens that were taken at swarming on September 17, 

 lived each with a king of another colony until the death of both 

 kings, when I placed them, on November 13, together without 

 workers in a Petri cell where they lived until the following June. 

 The first egg was laid on December 8, and the first larva appeared 

 on December 28, when there were fifteen eggs, cared for by both 

 queens. The queens continued to lay eggs, and young larvie 

 fre(iuently appeared among the eggs, but no larva lived longer 

 than two or three days. Up to April 28, four months after the 

 appearance of the first larva, no larva had been reared in this cell, 

 although more than one brood had meantime been successfully 

 reared in all similar cells where the queens were assisted by 

 workers. I then thoroughly cleaned the cell and replaced the 

 two queens. That same evening two eggs were deposited, and 

 when, on May 7, the eggs had been increased to eleven, I put in 

 two full-grown alien larvie, and later on a white pupa, all of which 

 were accepted by the queens. On ^lay 24 the pupa became a 

 minor ant, and at once began to assist the queens in the care of 

 the eggs. Ou May 25 two new \aivx were to be seen among the 

 eggs, and these larvie continued to grow and live. The two intro- 

 duced larvae also thrived, and ou June 10 the two queens and 

 three callows were together engaged in tending a promising group 

 of larvte, the first that were reared from eggs in this cell. 

 28 




434 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEJIY OF [Ju'v, 



Three solitary widowed queens of the five io my Petri ciills, 

 during four or more mouths after beginning to lay egg?, failed to 

 rear any larvse, although other queens to the number of seven, at 

 the same time and in exactly similar conditions, with the exception 

 of having worker-assistauts, all reared one or more broods. The 

 fourth solitary queen brought up a single male, I myself having 

 given her much help iu the feeding of one larva, the sole survivor 

 among many that appeared and perished during four mouths. 

 The fifth solitary queen had the assistance of workers in rearing 

 her first larvse, and later on when the workers were removed, she 

 indisputably fed and reared larvre all the way from the egg 

 upward. 



The length of the larval period has, in my nests of Sfeitamma 

 Julvum plceum, as is generally thought to be the case with other 

 ants, been apparently dependent on the amount and quality of the 

 food-supply. Between October 27 and May 9 I recorded the 

 beginning and end of the larval stage of twenty-six larvre from 

 queens' eggs. There was one of twenty days, one of twenty-one, 

 one of twenty-two, three of tweuty-four, one of twenty- five, one 

 of twenty-six, one of twenty-seven, four of twenty-eight, one of 

 twenty-nine, three of thirty, one of thirty-one, two of forty-two, 

 one of fifty-three, one of eighty-four, three of uiuety-three, and 

 one of ninety-seven days' duration. A.11 the larval periods shorter 

 than fortj'-three days were in domiciles where the queen was pres- 

 ent, and all over forty-three days were iu cells where the larvaj 

 were reared by workers alone. The assiduity of the worker is even 

 obviously greater when the queen is present. The shortest period 

 recorded was that of the larva in whose feeding I myself assisted 

 the queen. 



The length of the larval period does not determine the sex nor 

 the size of the ant. In the cases above recorded, one larva having 

 a period of twenty, one of thirty and one of ninety-three days 

 all ultimately became males. One larva with a period of twenty- 

 four, one of ninety-three and one of ninety-seven days all ulti- 

 mately became minims. The only queen hatched in luy nests had 

 a larval period of fifty-three days. A queens'-egg-larva now 

 under the care of three workers in one of my Petri cells has been 

 in the larval stage a hundred and forty days. 



From four to eight days previous to emergence from the larval 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 435 



stage, the larva expels the coateuts of the alimentary caual, ceases 

 to feed, aud changes in color from translucent white with a brown 

 core to creamy and more opaque white. Deprivation of food for 

 some days will cause any half-grown larva to make these prepara- 

 tions for becoming a pupa, aud minims can be reared at will. 



The larvse are kept resplendently clean by the licking given by 

 the workers. In my nests the workers appeared to learn a use 

 for the sponge, and when I at various times soiled a larva with 

 stale insect juices, they rubbed it upon the sponge to clean away 

 what they apparently disliked to lick ofi'. 



Either majors, minors, or minims alone can feed larvfe, but in mj- 

 Petri cells, where food is always near, they have rarely reared 

 more than three larvre to each adult worker. A minim alone with 

 a queen reared three larva3 simultaneously, and five majors together 

 reared sixteen. The anxiety which impels the nurses to lift the 

 immature young whenever the cell is uncovered probably hinders 

 their rearmg large numbers in these abodes. When disturbed, 

 the workers first lift the oldest in the nest, the pupas, the larvae or 

 the egg-packet. This order is also followed by the solitary queens. 



After the larvte are large enough to be removed from among 

 the eggs of a packet and to lie separatel}' on the floor, they are so 

 fed as to bring them to about the same size. As the eggs are laid 

 rather regularly, one or two a day, and are nearly equal in their 

 periods of incubation, the larvte, if evenly fed, would reach the 

 pupa stage one by one. But great natural possibilities of shorten- 

 ing or prolonging the larval period by increase or diminution of 

 the supplied nutriment, and the method of feeding the larvas so 

 unequally as to keep them nearly equal in size, causes the normal 

 nest to be at times without puj^re, and at times to be destitute of 

 advanced larvae. I have observed in natural nests, and also in my 

 artificial nests, that at times there are a great number of larvte 

 and no pup:e, and at times countless pupre with no advanced 

 larvaj. 



The larvffi grow to the length of the pupte perfected witliin their 

 integument, varying from two to five millimeters. When the thin, 

 transparent- white integument bursts, the ants clean the snow-white 

 naked pupa, and constantly watch over and tend it. Its first color 

 appears in the eye-spots, which are grayish on the third day and 

 broA-n on the fifth. On the tenth day, with the utmost regularity. 




436 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



there is a deposit of pigment on the dorsal side of the largest 

 segments of the abdomen, and this color spreads and deepens 

 until, on the twelfth day, the sex of the future ant can thereby 

 be foretold, the worker-pupa being yellowish all over, the male- 

 pupa gray-bodied with white limbs, the queen-pupa mottled brown 

 and orange with yellowish limbs. Two days later the worker-pupa 

 acquires the rich dark amber color which it retains as a callow ; 

 the slate color of the male-pupa deepens to black, and the queen- 

 pupa has the tints of au adult queen. The length of the i^upa- 

 stage was ascertained by me for seventy-three pupa, all presumably 

 the issue of queens' eggs, in fifteen different habitations, between 

 January 5 and ^lay 27. I took the time from emergence from 

 the larval sheath to the assumption of the standing posture as the 

 period of pupa-existence. Forty-four of my number proved to be 

 minims, and of these two became such on the fourteenth day, 

 twenty- three on the fifteenth day, and nineteen on the sixteenth 

 day. 



Fourteen became minors, and of these eleven became such on 

 the seventeenth day and three on the eighteenth day. 



Ten became majors, and of these five became such on the nine- 

 teenth day, four on the twentieth day and one on the twenty-first 

 day. 



The pupa-stage of the sixty-eight workers varied, therefore, 

 between thirteen and twenty-two full days; but the minims may 

 be said to have a pupa-period of about fifteen days, the minors a 

 pupa-period of about seventeen days, and the majors a pupa- 

 period of about nineteen days. 



Four of the seveuty-three pupffi became kings, and of these one 

 became such on the eighteenth day, two on the nineteentli day 

 and one on the twentieth day. 



One only became a (jucen. She was a pupa nearly seventeen 

 days, and died soon after beginning to walk about among the three 

 workers that reared her from a queen's egg. 



Of some hundreds of larv:e that have successfully been reared 

 to the pupa-stage by my captive ants, not more than teu have 

 failed to safely pass the pupa-stage and to live ou as ants. The 

 small proportion of deaths among the ant-children, iu so unnatural 

 an environmeut as is created by a glass nest and a human pur- 

 veyor, surely indicates a more than human skill on the part of the 




1901.] XATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 437 



adults in their care of the offspring, or else wonderful tenacity of 

 life on the part of the young ants. 



The workers care for the pupK with the same assiduity that dis- 

 tinguishes their attention to the eggs and the lar\-fe, but this atten- 

 tion does not appear to be necessary to the survival of the pupre. 

 I isolated ten pupas in a Petri cell, having the same warmth, 

 moisture, and general environment as had tho-se pup;c remaining 

 under the care of the workers, and although half of them were 

 taken from their nurses before any color had been deposited in 

 their integunfents, every one of them came safely to the adult- 

 stage. When, as callows, they were one by one returned to their 

 adult kin, they received such an extraordinary amount of licking 

 as to suggest the well-known theory that the pupte exude a sub- 

 stance which is liked by the ants, and that the attention of the 

 latter to the pupse is not wholly altruistic. 



These ants are very cleanly. In every nest where I have long 

 kept them they have chosen a fixed place for the throwing of re- 

 fuse, as remote as possible from the inert young. 



They carry morsels of food and lay them on the sponges, as if 

 with intent to moisten edibles that are too dry for their eating. 



They follow their usual occupations both by day and by night. 

 Individual ants rest sometimes for hours, standing motionless and 

 apparently asleep. I have seen a worker spend more than an 

 hour upon her toilet, combing or licking every part of her body 

 as tar as she could reach. ]Much willing service is renderd by the 

 adults to each other in the cleaning of their integuments. I saw 

 one worker hold another by a foot, apparently insisting upon such 

 service, which was rendered at intervals and was renewed only 

 when a limb was again nipped, during forty minutes. On the final 

 release of the operator the two ants turned mouth to mouth and 

 one regurgitated food to the other. 



Tbe muscular endurance of these ants seems to be great. They 

 will fight with no cessation during several hours, holding an enemy 

 by a limb or mandible. When the fight is a duel, the stronger ant, 

 or the ant that first succeeds in nipping a leg or an antenna, 

 thereby drags its opponent over objects, itself keeping the higher 

 ground, until the limb is severed. In the Lubbock nests, the 

 stronger fighter always threw the weaker into the moat, either 

 before or after the death of the unfortunate. When a battleground 




438 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Julv, 



presents a precipice, the attempt to push the enemy over it is 

 always noticeable. The successful use of the sting does not appear 

 to be fatal to an ant-enemy, although it gives pain in the human 

 hand for an hour or more. 



Notwithstanding the general harmony and mutual helpfulness in 

 a colony of Stenamma fidvum jnciivin, the ants have their indi- 

 vidual quarrels. Three queens had lived by themselves serenely 

 in a Petri cell for five months, giving common care for four 

 months to their single group of eggs, when two of the queens 

 began a tug of war, standing head to head, one holding the other 

 by a mandible, and dragging or pushing her over and around 

 the sponges. Uncovering the cell, watering the sponges, intro- 

 ducing an alien worker caused no cessation of the fray. The 

 third queen, distinguished from the other two by a fragment of 

 wing on one side, made frequent excursions to inspect the two 

 belligerents, and then returned quickly to continue her care of 

 the eggs. The battle persisted, with biief intervals, for four days, 

 and then one of the two combatants was left on the side of the cell 

 opposite the eggs, and tliere she remained in isolation for the 

 ensuing ten days. I several times lifted her and placed her close 

 to the other two queens and the eggs, but every time her wingless^ 

 enemy seized her by the small of her back, carried her across the 

 cell, and cast her down in the place for refuse, or else attacked and 

 drove her back to her place of banishment. On the eleventh 

 day the banished queen was permitted to return to her two sister 

 queens and the eggs, but she died on the following afternoon. 



One who watches the proceedings of these ants through many 

 months finds numerous occasions when the sequence of events 

 strongly suggests a designed punishment of individual offenders in 

 the colony. Twice I have seen an assembly of older ants, its 

 members ranged at nearly equal distances, forming a circle with all 

 heads toward the centre, remaining motionless except in vibrations 

 of the antenna; or a curious shaking of 'he abdomen, certainly 

 for some hours, and probably for some days. These assemblages 

 were each succeeded by an execution. In the one case an ant was 

 torn asunder and cast in the kitchen-midden. In the otlier ca.se 

 one ant was dismembered, and another ant picked up the head and 

 thorax of the dismembered victim and carried it about in the food- 

 room. She was carrying it at all the many limes wiieu I looked 




1901.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHIL.ADELPHIA. 4o9 



at her during the succeedirg three days. Of course, the sequences 

 noted may have been merely double coincidences in two unusual 

 proceedings of the ants. 



Both majors and minors among the Stenamma fulvum jjieeum 

 sometimes lay eggs, especially when no queen is present in their 

 habitation. The number of eggs laid is sometimes considerable. 

 I have seen as many as three hundred at once in a nest of fifty 

 workers from which a queen had been for several months absent. 

 One of my Petri cells, in which the eggs of five isolated workers 

 came to the larval stage, indicated that the time of incubation 

 of these eggs may be the same as for queens' eggs, eighteen or 

 nineteen days. The first egg was laid on February 21, the second 

 on February 23, and the eggs were gradually increased to ten. 

 The first larva appeared on the 12th and the second on the 14th 

 of IMarch. 



The larval period of workers' -egg-larvre under the care of 

 workers alone, appears to be much longer than for the queens' - 

 egg-larv?e under the care of queens alone, or under the care of 

 queens and workers, or under the care of workers alone. Judging 

 from data recorded from five groups of isolated workers that have 

 been rearing their own progenv in my nests during ten mouths, 1 

 think these larvre sometimes take more thnu two hundred days in 

 their growth from egg to pupa. 



The workers' eggs are about half as large as are the queens' 

 eggs; the larvre on issuing from the eggs are but half as large as 

 those issuing from queens' eggs; the pup£e are also much smaller 

 than are those of males produced from queens' eggs, and the adult 

 males are dwarfs, being from four to five millimeters in length of 

 body, without the wings. 



A colony captured by me on July 13, 1900, lost its only queen 

 on August 25. It was transferred from a .Janet to a new, clean 

 Fielde nest ou September 6, and after that date had no communi- 

 cation with any other nest. Between the 17th of the following 

 February and the 7th of June, 1901, twelve dwarf males were 

 successively produced. No ants of any other sort were during 

 four months produced in this queenless colony. All twelve of 

 these dwarf males, with the utmost regularity, showed eyespots and 

 ocelli of pale gray on the third day of pupal existence, and the 

 color deepened to black on the fifth day. On the tenth day the 




440 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JuIy, 



dorsal side of the abdomen became grayish, and on the twelfth 

 day the head, thorax and abdomen were slate color, while the 

 limbs remained white. Thereafter the color deepened to black, 

 and in each of the twelve cases the pupa became an ant on the 

 seventeenth day. 



Four of these dwarf males, that remained during their natural 

 lives with their worker-progenitors, lived respectively fifteen, thirty- 

 two, thirty-four and forty-five days. 



The food which the Stenamitia fulvum jiiceum were seen to eat in 

 captivity was, in the order of their apparent preference, fragments 

 of flies, roaches, mealworms, beetles and spiders ; morsels of 

 sponge-cake, white bread moistened with sweetened water or white 

 syrup; apple, banana, boiled sweet-potato ; fat of boiled fresh 

 beef; soft gum-droi), almond paste, pie crust, hickory nut and 

 honey. They showed no lively interest in other than insect food 

 of which they had been for some days deprived. They appeared 

 to avoid all raw or cooked meats other than particles of fat. 

 Their liking for a varied diet and their attention to unusual deli- 

 cacies indicate a highly developed sense of taste. 



Though the attitude ordinarily assumed in eating is that of 

 standing on all six legs and lapping the food, I have twice seen 

 an ant stand on four legs, using the front feet to hold an insect- 

 egg to its mouth, suggesting the posture in which a squirrel com- 

 monly eats nuts. 



The amount of food required to sustain life must be small. I 

 isolated sixteen workers in groups in clean Petri cells, containing 

 nothing but sponges that were frequently cleaned with ninety-five 

 per cent, alcohol and then saturated with water. Of these ants one 

 lived five days, five lived six days, two lived seven days, one lived 

 eight days, three lived nine days, one lived twelve days, one sixteen 

 days, one twenty-one days, and one thirty-four days without visible 

 food. That these ants died from starvation and not from other 

 cause was indicated by the control experiments in which other ants 

 similarly placed, but with a supply of food, continued to live on for 

 months. Tlie ability of Stenamma fulvum to endure starvation 

 is, however, exceeded by the less active Formica fiiscn and the 

 sluggish Ponera coarctata, one of the former having lived in my 

 Petri cell forty-one days, and one of the latter forty-three days, 

 without visible food. Formica saiiguinea shows lesser tenacity of 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 441 



life, as none of several subject to the same experiment lived more 

 than six days. 



The Stenamma fulvum piceum also meet extreme cold with impu- 

 nity. At about 50° F., or 10° C, they become sluggish, remain- 

 ing almost or quite motionless in their usual attitudes. I froze a 

 two-queen colony for twenty-four hours, the thermometer going 

 down to 23° F. , or 5° C. On gradually thawing the ants, all 

 survived, including callows but two days old, and the frozen 

 pupse, larvffi and eggs developed perfectly later on. Another 

 small colony was frozen continuously for five days, the thermome- 

 ter going down to 15° F. , or 10° C. The queen and all ihe 

 workers survived thawing, but a fifth of the workers died soon 

 after, and the queen, who had previously laid eggs almost daily 

 for five months, laid no egg thereafter for eighteen days. 



It is probable that these ants, being highly thermotactic, seek 

 the deeper, warmer recesses of their nests in the ground iu autumn, 

 and there hibernate until the warmth of spring draws them toward 

 the surface. 



The color of these ants manifestly deepens with age. The newly 

 hatched callows are translucent amber. The brown tint of the 

 adult first begins to appear on the dorsal side of the largest seg- 

 ments of the abdomen. Some of the majors have already this 

 beginning of brown coloration before they jjass the pupa stage. 

 The head, which is throughout life darker than the thorax, takes 

 on color next after the abdomen. Iu three or four months the 

 young worker has the color of an adult, but very old ants, queens 

 as well as workers, attain deeper shades of brown with passing 

 years. The males are fully colored, a glossy jet black, even before 

 leaving the pupa stage. 



I have not yet the data from which to draw conclusions concern- 

 ing the longevity of queens and workers, though 1 have those in 

 my nests that are certainly over one year old. The shorter-lived 

 males have furnished me the following record relating to their 

 longevity :

The king that lived longest, having been taken at the swarming, 

 must have lived considerably more than 102 days, aud his resi- 

 dence with a queen did not raanifesllj' shorten his days. 



The history of this little pair illustrates interesting traits of these 

 ants. The two were taken from different colonies on a sunny 

 morning after heavy rain, September 17, 1900. They were 

 immediately ])laced l)y themselves in a Petri cell, and were at once 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 443 



friendly. The courtship or honeymoon was rlistinguished by 

 mutual devotion. The one was rarely beyond the touch of Ihe 

 other, and the satisfaction of the two in their companionship was 

 apparently equal. If the queen moved the king usually followed. 

 If the king failed in constancy of attention to her, the ijueen 

 approached and by a s'de stroke of her antenna made him aware 

 of herself. This queen was exceptional in retaining all her wings 

 until after she deposited her first two eggs, on the 15th of Novem- 

 ber, two months after swarming. She had laid twenty-eight eggs 

 before she lost the wings of one side, on December 7, and she laid 

 many more before her last wing fell off in January. 



From the time of first egg laying, the king and queen both 

 watched over the eggs, one of them remaining on guard when 

 the other went to ihe opposite side of the cell to eat. The king 

 watched over the eggs in the absence of the queen, but he never 

 lifted them nor carried them about as did the queen. 



On the death of the king, December 28, after more than a 

 hundred days of wedlock, as he lay prone on his back with out- 

 spread wings, the queen piled her twenty eggs upon him, and hung 

 over the body persistently. On ensuing days I separated the 

 body, the queen and the eggs, first by a distance of a half-inch, 

 then of an inch, then of two inches, then of three inches, and in 

 a few hours after each separation the (]ueen had brought the body 

 and the eggs again together and stood with her head lowered over 

 them, her mouth usually near the king's mouth. On the fifth day 

 after his death, I moved his body to the opposite side of the cell, 

 and separated it from the eggs by an intricate route between the 

 sponges. The distracted queen at once set out in search of her 

 treasures, and in her efforts during the next two days to bring the 

 body and the eggs together, she so scattered the eggs that, fearing 

 the loss of them, I took out the shriveled body, collected the eggs, 

 and left the queen alone with them in a cleaned cell. 



Two males, one the issue of a workers' egg, the other of a 

 queens' egg, were later ou introduced separately into her cell, and 

 were killed and dismembered by her. 



The queen continued to lay eggs, and the eggs at frequent inter- 

 vals produced larvje, but this queen was evidently unable to feed 

 her young larv;e, and I had no workers of her own eoloiiy to 

 offer her. Up to the end of May, 1901, she continued to lay 




444 rROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



eggs and the young larvje continued to perish. Meantime two of 

 her eggs, given on January 31 to the care of three alien workers 

 living in a cell by themselves, had jjroducea one queen and one 

 king. 



After four months of failure had sufficiently shown the inability 

 •of this queen to alone rear her larvse, I attempted to reconcile her 

 to alien helpers, putting in at different times from other colonies five 

 young ^Yorkers of ages varying from a few days to a few hours, and 

 all were killed by her, or were removed on account of endangering 

 her life. One callow minor, after having been nine days in the 

 cell with the queen, nipped her so viciously and tenaciously that I 

 could release her only by decapitating her enemy. The mutual 

 fear and hostility of the queen and the alien workers, with the 

 common desire to possess and care for the eggs, always resulted in 

 the scattering and eventual loss of the eggs. 



However, two other alien workers, one minor and one minim, 

 introduced into the cell when but a few hours old, after several 

 days' residence with the queen and numerous timid tentative 

 approaches, perfectly affiliated with her. She laid no eggs there- 

 after until the ninth day in an eggless cell, and then she continued 

 to lay an egg or two daily, to be picked up and taken care of by 

 her adopted callows. Two white pupae were also introduced into 

 the eggless cell and there became ants, and in June the long 

 solitary and childless queen had four devoted workers caring for 

 her own young larvre. 



Ants have great aptitude in the recognition of their kin of the 

 same colony. A colony found in the woods just previous to its 

 swarming, on September 7, 1900, was divided and placed in two 

 nests, C—e and C-d, each with one queen. After eight months of 

 separation, ants brought together from the two nests perfectly and 

 immediately affiliated. 



Sister-queens of this colony, kept apart in Petri cells with a few 

 workers to June 17, lllOl, were after nine months' separation 

 from Iheir colony, received back with distrust. They were nabbed 

 and held by the workers, but they were themselves quiescent. 

 The attacks of the workers were hesitating and tentative, and after 

 they had passed their autennse over the whole body of the visiting 

 queen, they left her alone. After a few hours iu the nest, she was 

 beside her former associate, and the workers were gathered around 



i 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 445 



the two iu the manner usual with colonies that have two esteemed 

 queens. 



That the recognition of the ants is not personal is proven by 

 the following fact: Workers hatched in nest C'-e during the first 

 half of November, 1900, were isolated in nest A-a, while workers 

 hatched in nest C-d during the same period of time were isolated 

 in nest A-b. The two sections C-e and C-d had each its own 

 queen, workers and young, and there was no communication 

 between the two nests after the division of the original colony oa 

 September 7. Between nests A-a and A-b there was no com- 

 munication, and these two nests contained workers only. The 

 workers of nest A-a had never during their active lives met those 

 in A-b nest until six mouths after they all became ants, when I 

 put them together in a Petri cell. There was at first an exhibi- 

 tion of mutual distrust, and even of animosity, which gradually 

 disappeared when the antenu:e had been passed over the bodies of 

 the strangers, and in a half-hour all were amicably congregated 

 in a single group. 



These ants have a habit of bringing their bodies to a low level, 

 stretching their legs wide asunder, and creeping slowly up to an ob- 

 ject of suspicion, in a manner that is quite catlike in its stealthiness; 

 and this mode of appnjaching was often used toward the strangers, 

 after the antennas had once touched. 



I also transferred pup;e from C-d nest to the care of queens of 

 other colonies, and left them there in the care of aliens until they 

 became ants and reached the age of about sixteen days. On 

 returning these callows to the C-d nest, which they had left aa 

 pupie, they exhibited great fear of their relatives and hosts, sought 

 to stay in parts of the nest most remote from the resident com- 

 munity, hid themselves, and showed all the trepidation usual iu 

 ants that are put into a nest of aliens. On the other hand, the 

 resident auts made no unfriendly demonstrations toward the new- 

 coniers, and after these callows were forced into association with 

 them by confinement with a few of the adults in a small space, 

 the callows lost their fears and thereafter mingled freely and hap- 

 pily with all in the nest. In less than a day they were incor- 

 porated in the community where they accomplished their larval 

 career. 



Callows of the same stock, C-d, of the same age and the same 




446 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



rearing as the above, were introduced the same day into au abso- 

 lutely alien community, £-b, were instantly attacked, and were 

 dismembered and then fed to the larvfe or eaten by the ants. 



Four adult workers, two majors and two minors, that I took in 

 Atigust, 1900, from an apple-core by the roadside and isolated in 

 a Petri cell, on December 4 killed two alien callows that had just 

 come from the pupa-stage in C-d nest. The next day they 

 received three amber pupie from C-d nest, and one of these pupre 

 that same day became an ant, and of it the adult ants appeared 

 to be very fond. On the 6th and 8th of December they killed 

 two of its sisters, introduced when but a few hours old into their 

 cell. On December 9, when the callow hatched in this cell was 

 four days old, I put in an ant only seven hours old, also from the 

 C-d nest. The four-day-old callow was the first to meet the baby 

 ant in the Petri cell. It licked its junior from end to end, and 

 when the adults repeatedly approached and snapped with their 

 mandibles at the latest comer, the older callow stood over and 

 appeared to wittingly protect the younger. It then picked up the 

 baby ant, which was a minim quite as large as itself, and carried 

 it into the shade of ihe sponge where two ]yupx were attended by the 

 adult ants. There it stood between the adults and the baby, giving 

 attention alternately to it and to the pup;e, and often touching the 

 adults with its autenn;e, until after many minutes the adults left 

 all to its care. From that time the adults showed no further hostil- 

 ity toward the younger minim, and it continued to live in that cell. 



While it is generally true that Steiiamtna fiilriim piceum will cap- 

 ture and care for the eggs, larvfe and pupae of alien colonies, they 

 do not invariably roar these to adult life. 



A queen alone will not usually accept any worker from an alien 

 colony, but persistent effort may induce her to accept a very young 

 Avorker. 



A queen alone witk her eggs will not usually accept alien pujKC. 

 She carries them away and casts them in her rubbish heap. But 

 if alien larv;e are introduced she will accc])t them, and then she 

 will later on accejjt pup;e from the same stock. .She will at any 

 time accept alien eggs. 



Queens assisted by numerous workers will receive alien eggs, 

 larvie or pupa;, separately or together, the workers assuming 

 immediate charge of them. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 447 



I have seen queenless workers break up and feed alien pupx to 

 the larva; they were rearing, but when they had no larva; they 

 took excellent care of pupre from the same alien stock. As one 

 pupa will furnish an ample meal to a great number of larva;, there 

 may be much economy in thus utilizing an alien pujia that appears 

 unseasonably in their nursery. 



An explanation of the somewhat erratic behavior of the ants 

 toward alien young will be suggested in a subsequent paragraph. 



In many of the experiments made to test the power of these ants 

 in recognizing those of their own colony, I used a small number 

 of ants in each cell, and, without marking the ants, I could, by 

 choosing those of one shade from one colony and Ihose of another 

 shade from another colony, always identify the colony to which 

 any ant used in the experiment had originally belonged, and could 

 invariably return her to her own. 



The power of Stenamma fufvum pieeum to recognize another of 

 her own colony is not destroyed by freezing and thawing either 

 one or both of the individuals. 



Neither is it destroyed by merging one or both for an instant in 

 alcohol, in diluted oil of anise-seed or of bergamot, in tincture of 

 valerian or of asaftetida. The adult workers will survive dipping 

 in eighty per cent, alcohol or in the above-mentioned oils and tinc- 

 tures duly diluted. On returning the dipped workers to their 

 colony they are nut attacked as are aliens, though they may be for 

 a time avoided, and on recovering from the bath they join their 

 comrades in the common vocations of the nest. 



I repeated one of the experiments of Bethe and obtained with 

 my ants results similar to his. When I mashed ants of colony 

 C-e and with the juices thus obtained smeared ants of the alien 

 colony B-b, the C-e colony received the smeared ants without hos- 

 tility, and the smeared ants exhibited the trepidation usual at 

 finding themselves in an alien nest. Likewise, ants from the C-e 

 colony, freshly smeared with the juices of B-b ants, were not 

 attacked in the B-b nest, but they were evidently terrified in being 

 there. 



I then smeared a small number of B-b ants with the juices of 

 C-e ants, and put them into a new Petri cell with an etjual number 

 of unsmeared C-e ants; and I smeared a small number of C-e 

 ants with the juices of B-b ants and jjut them into a new Petri 




448 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Julv, 



cell with an equal number of unsmeared B-b ants. In do case 

 did the unsmeared ants attack the ants that had been merged in the 

 juices of their kin; but the smeared ants attacked the unsmeared 

 anis as they commonly attacked aliens. The smeared ants never 

 attacked each other. 



After a worker had been smeared in the juices of ants of an 

 alien colony and then isolated for aboui thirty hours it was 

 returned to its colony, and every worker that touched it with the 

 antennre started back in alarm, but it was not attacked nor 

 harmed. The juices probably wore off gradually, since smeared 

 workers returned to their colony after one week of isolation were 

 received with no sign of distrust. 



A queen that had for over three months peacefully shared the 

 cell and labors of a sister-queen and five workers was smeared with 

 the juices of aliens and at once returned to the cell. She was 

 immediately attacked by the workers as if she were an alien. 

 She evinced dread and submission in the usual manner of these 

 ants by cowering low, tightly shutting her mandibles, folding her 

 autennte and holding them close down upon her head. Three 

 workers together attacked her, but the attacks were intermittent, 

 and she soon crept up to her sister-queen. The queen prodded he 

 curiously with the ends of the antenute and .showed no animosity. 

 Then a worker came and nabbed her in places and licked her in 

 places, as though she was a composite of alien and kin. She was 

 kept aloof from the group for a day or two and then resumed 

 without harm her former associations. 



Workers merged in alien juices were likewise attacked on being 

 restoretl to their kin, but the attacks were not persistent and 

 none were slain. The losses of life or limbs all occurred through 

 the attacks of the smeared workers upon the aliens, among whom 

 they were as wolves in sheep's clothing. The smeared ants, in 

 spite of their disguise, must have retained some evidences of their 

 lineage which protected them from extreme violence. 



When two parties, each consisting of several workers that had 

 been merged iu the juices of the kin of the other party, were 

 placed together in a new Petri cell, there we're no violent attacks 

 from either side during the first two or three days. A tendency to 

 congregate according to colony showed itself from the beginning, 

 but by keeping the cell clean and preveuting'separate settlement of 




1901.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 449 



the two parties I secured the safety of both for eight days. When 

 I put in larvae there was strife for its possession, and at the end of 

 three weeks the only survivor of one party defended the larvse 

 against the sole survivor of the other party that, with but five 

 legs and a single antenna, still made stealthy approaches toward 

 the coveted young. 



My observations of Stenamma fulvum piceum sustain the usual 

 view that ants have an inherent and hereditary odor, or something 

 akin to odor, whereby they are identified as friends or enemies, and 

 that they impart this odor to places which they frequent. All the 

 phenomena that I have observed in the lives of Stenamma fulvum 

 piceum indicate that the distinctive odor may appear first in the 

 larvie, and a little less faintly in the pupaj; that it intensifies with 

 age as does the color; that the sensitivity of the queen to this odor 

 is greater than is that of the workers; that any distinctive odor 

 to which an ant is accustomed and with which it associates secu- 

 rity and satisfaction is attractive to it, while ant-odors to which it 

 is unaccustomed excite alarm and hostility in proportion to their 

 strangeness. For such causes, ants that have come from the eggs 

 of colony 31 and in their pupa-stage were transferred to colony N, 

 while they affiliate perfectly with the A^ants that they live among, 

 quickly recognize the odor of the M ants because it is their own. 

 As to the origin of the distinctive colony odor, it appears possi- 

 ble that it may be traced to a king. 



Among Stenamma fulvum j^ieeum there are diSerences in indi- 

 vidual traits. Some are more truculent than are others of their 

 sex, age and size; or are more assiduous in their attention to the 

 young; or more devoted to the queen or the males; or more grega- 

 rious in habit ; or more attached to the home ; or more hostile toward 

 aliens. Every characteristic of a typical Stenamma fulvum piceum 

 appears strongly in certain individuals and is comparatively weak 

 in others. 



The increasing tameness of my captive ants has been observable. 

 After some months of acquaintance, these ^lyrmicid ants have 

 wholly ceased to sting me when I handle them. 



So domesticated have they become in their artificial nests that 

 they rarely run outside their houses when uncovered, and the 

 accustomed routine of cleaning their dwellings agitates them 

 scarcely at all.

CRYSTALLINE AND CRYSTALLOIDAL SUBSTANCES AND THEIR 

 RELATION TO PLANT STRUCTURE. 



BY HENRY KRAEMER, PH.D. 



Niigeli and Schwendener,' in the preface to their chapter on mor- 

 phology, give us probably the most comprehensive idea of the scope 

 of the subject. They say: " Zur Morphologic im weiteren Sinue 

 des Wortes gehort die ganze Lehre vom Aufbau der Ogauismeu 

 aus den Elementeu, woraus sie bestchen — vou den Micellen, 

 welche die Bausteine der Zellen bildeu, bis hinauf zu den Einhei-

 Morphologie hat zu ermittelen, unter welchen bestimmteu Form — 

 und Lagerungsverhiiltnissen die Micellen und Micellarschichten

 und endlich auch die Entwicklung neuer Organe aus schou vor-

As a result of having given considerable attention to what might 

 be termed the morphology of plant constituents and having made 

 a number of observations while trying to produce artificially from 

 chemical solutions crystalline and crystalloidal substances resem- 

 bling those formed naturally in the plant, such as calcium sails, 

 inulin, hesperidin, etc., a number of questions have arisen in the 

 author's mind concerning morphological development which are 

 set forth in this paper. 



Sphere-crystals are spherical aggregates of crystals with sharp

angular contours which are made up of but one substance, the 

 molecule of which is simple, or at least not very complex. This 

 class includes carbon compounds as well as inorganic substances. 

 Of these may be mentioned calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, 

 calcium oxalate, amygdalin, strychnine, berberine, etc. Some of 

 these compounds are soluble in water while others are not, hence 

 we may say that there are both soluble and insoluble sphere-crys- 

 tals. As examples of the former may be mentioned the glucosides 

 and alkaloidal salts, while as examples of the latter we have cal" 

 cium phosphate and oxalate, the alkaloids, etc. 



The spherites resemble somewhat the sphere-crystals, but are 

 distinguished from them by the fact that they have a more com- 

 plex composition and the individual crystals have either a somewhat 

 rounded outline or are imbedded in colloidal substances in which 

 the crystalline or crystalloidal character is more or less obscured 

 and hence with difficulty discerned. 



The spherites also admit of a classification into soluble and 

 insoluble bodies. The soluble spherites, or those directly soluble 

 in water, include hesperidin, inuliu aud allied carbohydrates, and 

 their crystalline character is most apparent when the specimens are 

 dehydrated with alcohol. 



The insoluble spherites are not directly soluble in water, but may 

 be rendered so by treatiuent with certain reagents. These include 

 starch and the fundamental substances entering into the composi- 

 tion of the cell-wall. The spherite character of these substances 

 is not at once apparent, but can be demonstrated by the use of 

 reagents which cause a swelling of the substances in the starch- 

 grain or in the cell wall. In a paper^ communicated to the Society

of Plant Morphology and Physiology, 1899, the author enumer- 

 ated the substances which could be used to bring out the spherite 

 structure in the starch-grain. The same kind of reagents, but in 

 stronger solutions, may be used to bring out the spherite structure 

 in the wall of thickened parenchyma cells, as endosperm, or 

 lignitied cells, as stone cells. In cases where the cell-wall has been 

 metamorphosed into mucilage, simple treatment with water, as has 

 also been shown with the starch-grain, is sufficient to bring out 

 the structure.' The reason that this structure is not apparent 

 under natural conditions is because the refractive properties of the 

 crystf.lloidal substance so nearly resembles that of the associated 

 colloid. The use of certain reagents, however, which are more or 

 less penetrating in their action, cause an imbibition of water by 

 the colloidal portions with consequent swelling of the grain, or cell- 

 wall, and a contrast in refractive power with the more insoluble 

 and hence unaffected crystalloidal substances. 



Sphere-crystals are further distinguished from spherites in that 

 the latter are capable of taking up or holding certain coloring 

 principles, as safranin, gentian violet, etc. It is questionable, 

 however, if the crystalloids contained in the spherite take up the 

 coloiing matters, it being probable that the colloid associated with 

 the crystalloid is the portion that is colored, as I have already 

 shown in m^- studies on the structure of the starch-grain. 



In the cell-wall the crystalloids occur in very close radial and 

 tangential rows and constitute by far the greater proportion of the 

 wall. In the starch-grain, on the other hand, there is apparently 

 a greater preponderance of colloidal matter which takes up certain 

 stains. This layering, which is well marked in the starch-grain, 

 is scarcely distinguishable in the cell-wall. The reason that it is 

 not so well marked in the cell-wall is because of the difference in 

 amount of Ihe crystalloidal and colloidal substances, the close 

 arrangement of the crystalloids and also the difficulty of obtaining 

 uniform microscopical sections, as can be readily obtained with the 

 starch-grain. 



(12) Potassium nitrate solution (saturated). 



(13) Tannin solution. 



(14) Potassium pliosphate solution (saturated). 



(15) Hydrochloric acid (5 per cent.). 



(16) Water between the temperatures of 50- C. and 70^ C. 



' This would tend to show that the crystalliue structure is not due to the 

 precipitation of substances by the reageuta used. 




190].] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 453 



The structure, as well as the mode of formation, of spherites 

 and sphere-crystals is apparently the same. The mode of forma- 

 tion is, furthermore, apparently the same whether observed in 

 nature or as carried on artificially. The different stages in their 

 natural formation can be followed comparatively easily in those 

 .parts of plants containing hespcridin (as the epicarp of citrous 

 fruits) or inulin (as roots of artichoke, etc.). It is interesting to 

 compare these crystals or spherites with those formed artificially 

 by evaporation of solutions of inulin or hesperidin. It is also 

 instructive to compare the natural oxalates, phosphates, and car- 

 bonates of calcium with those formed artificially by precipitation of 

 soluble calcium salts with alkaline oxalates, phosphates or car- 

 bonates. 



After a comparison of the artificiallv produced spherites or 

 sphere-crystals with those formed naturallv in the plant, one cannot 

 but conclude that there is a play of similar forces in their forma- 

 tion. 



Furthermore, if we examine the crystal masses remaining in a 

 watch-crystal after the spontaneous evaporation of solutions of 

 various substances, under varying conditions of temperature, etc., 

 we observe not only the formation of crystals which reseiuble' those 

 produced in the plant cell, but other rather striking forms of com- 

 bination which are very. suggestive indeed; leading one to a com- 

 parison of the arrangement of the products of crystallization with 

 the apparent multiplicity of forms found in plant life. Indeed, 

 the arrangement of the crystals in such a watch-crystal reminds 

 one of the appearance of our woods in winter, when the absence 

 of leaves permits the observance of fundamental lines of develop- 

 ment in shrubs and trees. 



If we take an alum solution (such as a Delafield's Hrematoxylon 

 Solution), dilute it with water and allow it to evaporate sponta- 

 neously in a watch-crystal, the result will be the formation of con- 

 centric rows of acicular crystals which show an analogy to the 

 structure of the wheat starch-grain after treatment with the re- 

 agents mentioned. 



The crystalline residue from a cocaine solution resembles a group 

 of sclerenchyma cells in transverse section, the individual sphere- 

 crystals resembling single cells, the portion corresponding to the 

 wall being made up of radiating acicular crystals which even join 




454 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



with those of the adjoining sphere-crystals. The latter arrange- 

 ment may be likened to the pores in such thickened cell-walls. 



A resemblance to the wavy contour of the walls of transverse 

 sections of epidermal cells is exhibited in the residue formed by 

 the evaporation of brucine solutions. 



The infoldings in the parenchyma cells in pine stems and leaves , 

 is exemplified in the arrangement of the crystals which result from 

 the evaporation of solutions of amygdalin. 



From solutions of caffeine hydrobromate there separate crystals 

 which in abundance and in aiTaugeraent resemble a dense mycelial 

 development of peuicillium with conidia. 



The crystalline residue from solutions of berberine shows a 

 marked resemblance to the outer morphology of certain Lycopc- 

 diums, species of Jmiijier and other similar arborescent plants. 

 Illustrations of this kind could be multiphed which would lend to 

 show a relationship between the form of crystalline groups and 

 the ultimate arrangement of the substances entering into the com- 

 position of the plant. 



The chemist has considered but one phase of the suljject of 

 crystallization, namely, the form and nature of individual crystals. 

 The botanist, however, until recently has considered the aggre- 

 gation of morphological units, as is evidenced in his studies on the 

 outer and inner morphology of plants. But as the form and 

 nature of the individual units are seen to depend more or less upon 

 the nature of the substances comprising them, it becomes of fun- 

 damental importance to study the composition of these units in 

 their relation to form and structure. 



In the case of inorganic bodies chemical as well as physical tests 

 are necessary to prove the identity of a .substance. In the organ- 

 ized, or organic, world it has been impossible to define a species or 

 designate the limitations of a species because our studies have been 

 directed almost entirely to the outer morphology of individuals 

 rather than to the study of the substances which, grouped 

 together, form these individuals and the physical and chemical 

 forces underlying their structural arrangements. 



Tiie same substance may under different conditions develop 

 different outer forms, as, for example, alum may crystallize in 

 monoclinic prisms, hexagonal prisms, or in arborescent forms or 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 455 



■sphere-crystals. Chemical tests are necessary to prove the identity 

 of the substance in these various forms. 



Not all substances, however, show this tendency to variation in 

 form of crystals, as, for example, caffeine, berberine, and still 

 ■other substances which show a tendency to uniformity in general 

 ■outline. 



If, then, there is so much variation in the form and arrangement 

 of crystals of the same substance when artificially formed, to 

 what extent may not variation in form take place in bodies of 

 ■complex composition and therefore influenced by complex attrac- 

 tions and repulsions ? Now while we see in the crystal a decided 

 tendency to uniformity of structure under similar conditions, yet, 

 admitting of modifications under varying conditions, we must 

 allow that in organized structures this tendency to uniformity is 

 modified over and over again. 



In the plant world similar variations are observed, not only in 

 forms of the elements (roots, stem, leaves, flowers, fruits and 

 seeds) comprising the individual, but also in cell-contents. In 

 «ome so-called species individuals vary greatly as regards form of 

 •elements, as in oaks, violets, etc. In others a constancy is 

 observed, as in Erythronlmi. In still others a variation in the 

 form assumed of some of the cell-contents is observed, as in the 

 crystals of calcium oxalate in Datura stramonium,* while in other 

 crystals a constancy of form is observed, as with calcium oxalate 

 in the genus Viola. Even in the study of starch-grains one 

 observes a constancy in the form of the grains in all plants. 

 There is, however, a sufficient modification in some of the grains 

 in the reserve underground parts of such plants as potato, maranta, 

 ■etc., to justify one in pronouncing on the origin of the starch. 

 The same may be said of other substances, as calcium oxalate, 

 inulin and other carbohydrates, etc. 



The selection of certain constant forms of cell-contents or of cell- 

 walls would appear to be of as much, or greater, importance in 

 •designating the limitations of a species as the outer form of ele- 

 ments, which it is evident are dependent upon the arrangement of 

 ■aggregates of substances making up the individual. As this 

 .arrangement is due, on the one hand, to the chemical factors, food

and air, and, on the other, to the physical factors, light and tem- 

 perature, variations are bound to occur. If, however, these varia- 

 tions are constant for a series of successive generations and can be 

 demonstrated in cell-contents, cell-walls and cell-functions, then a 

 species has been formed, but not otherwise. 



In the inorganic world, as we well know, physical and chemical 

 tests both are oftentimes necessary to prove the identity or specific 

 nature of a substance. Likewise in the biological world physical 

 and chemical tests of cell-contents, cell-walls and the products of 

 cell-function are necessary to establish the specific character of an 

 individual.

THE NASAL PASSAGES OF THE FLORIDA ALLIGATOR. 

 BY ALBERT M. REESE, PH.D. 



The material upon which the following work was done was 

 received by the writer from southern Georgia, about the first of 

 August, whence it had been sent by express to Baltimore ' It 

 consisted of about thirty eggs of AlUcjator mmissippie>isis, most of 

 which contained embryos in an advanced stage of development 

 These embryos were fixed in Kleinberg's dilute picro-sulphuric 

 mixture, giving a fair fixation, and were stained in borax carmine 

 and Lyon's blue. Serial sections were cut through the head in 

 transverse, horizontal and sagittal planes. Although the structure 

 of the nasal cavity, even of so advanced an embryo, cannot be 

 taken to represent that of the adult, there have been so few figures 

 of this character published that the following account mav be of 

 interest. 



_ As may be seen from Plate XXIV, figs, la and 16, the embryo 

 IS in an advanced state of development, and already shows distinct 

 reptilian characters. The first series of sections (figs. 2a-l) was 

 cut at right angles to the long axis of the snout of the embryo 

 (fig. U, x-rj), or rather it was intended to be an exactly trans- 

 verse series but, by faulty orientation, the sections were so cut that 

 the right side is inclined, somewhat, toward the base of the snout 

 This departure from the exact transverse position is the cause of 

 the lack of symmetry in the two sides of the nasal cavity, as seen 

 m this series of sections. Fig. 2a represents a section throu-h 

 the tip of the upper jaw. On the left it passes through the ex- 

 treme edge of the wall of the nasal cavity, while on the right side 

 which is nearer the base of the snout, il, cuts through the ri-ht 

 nasal aperture, r.n.a. Near the centre of the section is seen The 

 extreme tip of the nasal cartilage, n.c. The body wall, bw,m 

 this section, as in all following sections, is represented by a heavy 

 black line.

458 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Julv, 



Fig. 26 is somewhat further from the tip of the snout aud cuts 

 through the extreme point of the lower jaw, l.j. On either side 

 of the large, median, nasal cartilage, n.c, is seen the nasal canal, 

 l.n.c. and r.n.c. On the left, the canal is, at this point, somewhat 

 circular in cross section, while on the right, which, it will be 

 remembered, is nearer to the base of the snout, the canal is more 

 elongated in a dorso-ventral direction. The walls of the nasal 

 passages are lined with cilia, and are, in most places, many cells 

 thick. On account of the low magnification used, no attempt has 

 been made to represent the cilia and cell outlines in these figures. 

 The collections of cells, t.r., in this and the following sections are 

 the rudiments of the teeth. At the point represented in fig. 2c, 

 the nasal cartilage, n.c, has increased considerably in extent and 

 almost completely surrounds the nasal passages on each side. In 

 this and the following two sections, the plate of cartilage, h. , which 

 lies ventral to the nasal passage on each side, seems no longer to 

 be continuous with the vertical septum, s., as in the [)receding 

 figure, although it is still in close contact with it. The nasal 

 canals are drawn out, in this section, in a ventro- lateral direction, 

 until their passages are reduced to mere slits. The passage on the 

 right is drawn out, laterally, toward a small group of cells, r.n.g., 

 the apparent rudiment of one of the nasal glands. The teeth 

 rudiments, t.r., are seen in both upper and lower jaws, in the 

 former of which they are very large, in proportion to the size of 

 the jaw. The cartilages of the lower jaw are seen on each side, 



TO.C. 



In fig. 2d the nasal canals are still more closely invested by the 

 nasal cartilages. On the right, the section passes through the open- 

 ing of the right nasal gland, r.n.g., into the uasal passage of the 

 corresponding side. On the left side of the section is seen the left 

 nasal gland, l.n g., cut in front of its opening into the nasal pas- 

 sage, that is, between this opening and the tip of the snout. In 

 all the following figures anterior will mean toward the tip of the 

 snout, posterior will mean toward the base of the snout or of the 

 head. 



Fig. 2e is a short distance posterior to the last figure. On the 

 right it passes through the extreme anterior edge of the right eye, 

 e., while on the left the section is anterior to the eye. The nasal 

 cartilage, n.c, on the right, completely encloses the nasal passage 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 459 



of that side, and thus lie3 between that passage and its nasal 

 gland. The section is cut posterior to the opening of the right 

 nasal gland, r.n.r/., into the right nasal passage, r.n.c. The left 

 «ide of the section passes through the opening of the left nasal 

 gland, l.n.g., into the left nasal passage. 



In the next section (fig. 2/) the complexity of the nasal appar- 

 atus has, apparently, considerably increased. In the first place, 

 the ventral portions of the nasal cartilage, which, anterior to this 

 point, formed a more or less complete wall rentral to the nasal 

 passages, have disappeared, and on the right the dorsal portion of 

 the cartilage has separated from the median, s., and is now repre- 

 sented by a short straight piece, n.c' ., and a long curved piece, 

 n.c, enclosing a part, c, of the right nasal passage. On the left 

 the dorsal wall of cartilage is still connected with the median sep- 

 tum. The nasal passages are here of quite different shape from 

 what they were in the preceding section. They are still more 

 elongated in a dorso-ventral direction, and that on the right, 

 which is nearer the base of the snout, is cut at the point, v. p. , at 

 which it opens ventrally into the narrow ventral passage, which, 

 in turn, leads posteriorly to open at the posterior nares. d. repre- 

 sents a narrow diverticulum, projecting in a ventro-lateral direc- 

 tion, which may be followed almost to the posterior end of the large 

 dorsal passage. A large branch of the main nasal passage, r.n.c, 

 is represented ate, and the following section passes through the 

 point at which this lateral passage opens ventrally into the main 

 passage. 



On the loft side of the section is seen the left nasal gland, l.n.g., 

 cut posterior to its opening into the left nasal passage. On either 

 side of the ventral end of the median cartilage, s., is seen a small 

 collection of cells, j., which, according to Rose, is the rudimentary 

 Jacobsou's organ. These two collections of cells, which will be 

 spoken of as " Jacobson's organ," extend from this point poste- 

 riorly for a considerable distance, as two solid rods of cells; they 

 then become hollowed out to form tubes, which soon open ven- 

 trally into the ventral nasal passages, v.j). , as will be shown in one 

 of the following figures. The section represented in fig. 2; passes 

 near the extreme anterior end of Jacobson's organ. 



In fig. 217, which is only a short distance posterior to the One 

 just described, Jacobson's organ is still seen as two solid rods of 




460 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Julv, 



cells. On the right, the ventral nasal passage, v. p., is cut posterior to 

 its opening into the main nasal passage and is hence seen as an inde- 

 pendent, circular passage. On the left, the section passes through 

 the opening of the left ventral passage, v.p'., into its adjacent 

 main nasal passage. The ventro-lateral diverticula, d. and d'. , are 

 seen on either side. The right side of the section passes through 

 the opening of the cavity c. into the ventral part of the right nasal 

 passage, r.n.c, while on the left the corresponding cavity, c'., is 

 cut anterior to its opening and is surrounded on all sides by the 

 nasal cartilage. In the preceding section the cavity e. was cut pos- 

 terior to the region at which it was completely surrounded by car- 

 tilage. 



In fig. 2/( the nasal cartilages have about the same outline as in 

 the figure just described, the sections represented by these two 

 figures being close together. Jacobson's organ, j., has increased 

 somewhat in size, but there is still no trace of a cavity in either 

 part. Both ventral nasal tubes, v.])., are now entirely distinct 

 from the main nasal cavities and are somewhat circular tubes lined 

 with columnar cells. On the left the side cavity, c'., is still sur- 

 rounded by cartilage, being again cut anterior to its opening into 

 the left nasal passage, l.n.c, while on the right of the section, at 

 the point c, the side cavity is seen to open dorsally into the main 

 nasal cavity. The relation of this side cavity to the main nasal 

 cavity is made plain by reference to fig. 3a, which represents a 

 section cut in the plane a-b, fig. lb. The section passed through 

 the dorsal part of the nasal cavities, cutting the cavity on the right 

 so far dorsally that but little indication of the side cavity, c, is 

 evident. It is plain, from this figure, that what has been called 

 aside cavity, c'., is merely the posterior end of the main nasal 

 cavity which has bent around until it projected outward and for- 

 ward, and thus gave the idea, in transverse section, of a distinct 

 oftshoot from the main nasal cavity, l.n.c. Fig. 3a shows how 

 the nasal cartilage, ii.c, pushes in between the cavity c' and the 

 main cavity, l.n.c, giving the impression, in transverse section, 

 that the cavity c' is completely surrounded by cartilage. In a 

 section ventral to this one, what has been called the main nasal 

 cavity, l.n.c, is seen to extend somewhat further toward 

 the brain, bt:, and in that way the cavity c'. is made to appear 

 more like a branch of the main cavity than simply a forward 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 461 



bending of the larger cavity. This posterior extension of the 

 main nasal cavity is shown in fig. 2i, l.n.c. Fig. oa shows that 

 the median nasal cartilage, s., extends back between the eyes, and 

 becomes continuous with the cartilage surrounding the brain. It 

 is somewhat swollen at a point about half-way between the nasal 

 cavities and the brain. 



The section represented in fig. 21 passes through the extreme 

 posterior part of the main nasal cavities, l.n.c. and r.n.c, and 

 cuts the ventral canals, v. p., posterior to the point at which Jacob- 

 son's organ opens into them. The way in which this takes place 

 will be described later. The lateral parts, n.c, of the nasal carti- 

 lages have diminished considerably in size, and now lie much 

 nearer to the median cartilage, s. This section passes through the 

 anterior ends of the two olfactory lobes, o. I. 



In fig. 2/ is represented a section cut posterior to the nasal 

 cavity, so that neither of the main or dorsal nasal chambers are 

 seen. The ventral passages, v. p., have about the same size and 

 position as in the preceding figure, while the lateral cartilages, 

 II. c, are reduced to mere rods, lying close against but not fused 

 with the median cartilage, s. A short distance posterior to this 

 point these cartilages end. 



The section seen in fig. 2k is some distance posterior to the one 

 just described, and shows how the ventral canals, v. p., unite to 

 form a single median canal, before they open posteriorly as the 

 posterior nares. 



This section does not cut the lateral parts of the nasal cartilage, 

 but the median septum, «., is seen extending dorsally, b.c, on 

 either side of the olfactory lobes, o.l. The outlines of the muscles 

 of the eyes are shown in this as well as in the following figure by 

 dotted lines, m. 



Fig. 21 is somewhat posterior to fig. 2k, and passes through the 

 opening of the ventral passages, the posterior nares, p.n.. The 

 other points brought out in this figure are about the same as in 

 fig. 2/;, and need no further desci'iptiou. 



Fig. 4(1 represents, under a much higher magnification, a part 

 of one of the sections of the series that has just been described. 

 The ventral end of the median cartilaginous septum is shown at s., 

 and the ventral ends of the right and left nasal passages are seen 

 at ;■. n. c and /. n. c. The walls of these passages are made up of 




462 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



one or more layers of cubical or columnar ciliated cells. The 

 ventral passages, v. p., are lined with similar cells, except that no 

 cilia could be made out. On the left is seen, dorsal to the left 

 ventral passage, the tubular organ of Jacobson, j., which is cut 

 anterior to its opening into the ventral passage, v.p; its cavity ia 

 small, in cross section, and only extends for a short distance ante- 

 riorly, the greater part of the organ being a solid rod of cells with- 

 out any visible cavity. On the right side of the figure, which, it 

 will be remembered, is posterior to the plane of the left side, is 

 seen the opening of Jacobson's organ, j., into the right ventral 

 canal, vqi. The united cavities of the ventral canal and Jacob - 

 son's organ have a sharply triangular outline, which is maintained 

 for a considerable distance posterior to the point at which they 

 first come together. The walls of the organ are of about the same 

 structure as those of the ventral passages. For the sake of sim- 

 plicity the mesoblast cells in this and in ail of the preceding sec- 

 tions have not been represented. They are typical mesoblast cells 

 and surround numerous blood vessels. 



Fig. 5a represents a sagittal section of an embryo of the same 

 stage of development as the one represented in fig. la. The sec- 

 tion is nearly, but not exactly, in the median plane, so that some of 

 the organs are cut medianally while others are cut to one side of 

 the median plane. The general outline of the head is well shown 

 and the relative positions of the main regions can be seen. The 

 brain, br., and spinal cord, s.c, are represented in the heavier 

 shading; the cartilaginous parts, including the vertebral column, 

 V.C., in the lighter areas. The great size of the nasal cavity is due 

 to the fact that the section passes through one of the main nasal 

 passages in the plane of its greatest diameter, fig. 2/. The 

 other parts of the head will be easily understood by reference to 

 the letters. As in the previous sections, the mesoblast has been 

 omitted for convenience and simplicity.

ADDITIONS TO THE JAPANESE LAND SNAIL FAUNA, IV. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



lu the present communication the description of Japanese 

 Clausiliidce is continued, and that of the Pupidce begun. The 

 genesis of Balea-lihe forms in Japan is considered in some detail, 

 together with various other divergent branches from the Euphsedu- 

 soid phylum. 



For most of the material described I am indebted to the liber- 

 ality of Jlr. Y. Hirase, a corresponding member of this Academy. 



Mr. E. R. Sykes also has entrusted to me certain specimens col- 

 lected in Japan by Dr. Hungerford, many years ago, representing 

 species described but not figured by Dr. O. von MollendorlF; and 

 I have included herein some account of such of these as are closely 

 related to my new forms. My thanks are due to both of these 

 co-workers for their kind assistance. 



Section ZAPTYX PUs. 



Proc. A. iV. S. P., 1900, p. 672. 



This strongly differentiated group has hitherto been known from 

 southern Kiushiu and the Loo Choo Islands only ; but a represen- 

 tative has now been found to the north and east in an island 

 belonging to the province of Izu. I have attempted below to 

 explain its presence there. 



Typical Clamilia (^Zaptyx) Hirasei occurs at Kagoshima, the 

 type locality, and on Sakura Island in Kagoshima Bay. A more 

 slender form, of a richer, darker brown color, but the same internal 

 structure, has been sent by Mr. Hirase (No. 557) from Kikai,' 

 Osumi, at the head of Kagoshima Bay. JNIany specimens are 

 very small, length 7i mm., but others reach lOi mm. in length. 

 As the shell is quite slender, this is one of the smallest Clausilias 



' In treating of Eulota connivens, Proc. Malac. Soc. Lond., IV, p. 77, 

 Mr. Gude has confused this locality with the island Kikai-gashima, of the 

 Oshima group, south of Kiushiu. This island is in the Loo Choo group, 

 broadly speaking, but belongs for administrative purposes to Kagoshima 

 Ken or prefecture.

Clausilia hachijoensis n. sp. PI. XXVII. figs. 39, 40. 



Shell fusiform, rimate, rather thin, of a dark, rich brown color; 

 rather weakly wrinkle-striate, the latter part of the last whorl 

 distinctly and sharply striate. Whorls 8 to 8^-, slightly convex, 

 the apex obtuse, the last whorl somewhat flattened laterally, and 

 gibbous or sack-like below. Aperture trapezoidal-piriform, the 

 peristome continuous, brown, narrowly expanded and subreflexed. 

 Superior lamella rather small, compressed, vertical, distant from the 

 spiral lamella. Spiral lamella short, lateral, not reaching a ventral 

 position, a short lamella fukrans lying parallel to it. Inferior 

 lamella receding, immersed, visible in an oblique view in the aper- 

 ture, moderately spiral within; subcolumellar lamella either emerg- 

 ing or immersed. Principal plica short and lateral, one or two 

 short sutural plicre lying above it; upper palatal j)lica exceedingly 

 short and joining the kmella. Lunella lateral, rather long and 

 straight. 



Clausilium strongly curved throughout, the apex rounded, 

 straightened or slightly emarginate on the palatal side, near the 

 apex. 



Length 10, diam. 2 J to 2^ mm. 



Bachijo (or Hachijo) Island, prov. Izu (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 

 638). 



This species is aboul the size of the largest specimens of C 

 Hirasei and C. hijj)eroptyx, but is a trifle wider. It differs from 

 both in wanting a parallel lamella, and the upper palatal plica is 

 extremely short, a mere dilation of the upper end of the lunella. 

 In C. Hira.iei it stands free of the lunella, and in C. hyjieroptyx is 

 united with it and is much longer. The principal plica is shorter 

 than in the other two species. The clausilium is much more 

 curved than in either of these specie.s, and its apical end has a 

 somewhat difllerent shape. 



The specimens were sent with C. Tryoni, an Euphcedtisa much 

 resembling this species in size and color. 



Bachijo or, as most charts spell it, Hachijo (or sometimes 

 Fatsizio) Lsland lies in the Pacific just above the 33d parallel N. 

 lat. , and near 140° E. long. It is somewhat over 100 miles from 

 the nearest mainland, and is about twenty-one miles long by seven

and a half wide. A chain of islets reaches northward to the 

 Sagami Sea; but I am disposed to believe that its moUuscan fauna 

 has been derived chiefly from the islands south of Kiushiu by means 

 of drift, as it lies directly in the Kuro Shi wo, or " Black Current," 

 and Zaptyx, the group to which C. Haehijoends belongs, is dis- 

 tinctly a southern group, unknown in Hondo Island. Small islets 

 at wide intervals are scattered down to the Bonin (Ogasawara) 

 group, but they rise from a submarine ridge in the sea bed between 

 1,000 and 2,000 fathoms depth. 



The two species of Clauailia here described and Clausilia 

 (Reinia) variegata var. nedotica Pils. are the first land shells 

 known from the island.

 8, rather convex, the apex obtuse, next three or four whorls 

 attenuated, the last whorl flattened on its last half. Aperture 

 piriform, the peristome rather thin, narrowly expanded and subre- 

 flexed, continuous, adnate or very shortly free above, deeply emar- 

 ginate at the position of the superior lamella. Superior lamella 

 thin but high, continuous with the spiral lamella. Inferior lamella 

 rather small, weak below, though emerging nearly to the lip-edge, 

 rather abruptly becoming stronger and converging toward the 

 superior lamella within, strongly spiral. Subcolumellar lamella 

 emerging. Principal plica short, its lower end visible from the 

 aperture, deep within the throat, the other end extending past the 

 palatal plicte to a lateral position. Upper and lotcer palatal jilicce 

 small, oblique and parallel, lateral in position, the lower one 

 smaller. There is no trace of a lunella. The inferior and spiral 

 lamelL'e are of equal length within, and reach to the middle of the

The clausilium is broad, strongly curved, a little pointed or 

 tapering toward the apex, and very slightly thickened there.

 known by the unusually strong superior lamella, emerging sub- 

 columellar lamella and total absence of a lunella, the two palatal 

 folds being small, remote and parallel. The elausilium though 

 wide is a little tajDering below, and less thickened at the apex than 

 in most of the related species. 



There is some variation in sculpture, one specimen being densely

 convex, the last two forming much more than half the shell's 

 length, and of about equal diameter. Aperture of a broad, 

 squarish-oval form, scarcely narroioer above than below ; peristome 

 white, reflexed, continuous, the strong parietal margin arcuate and 

 in part adnate. Superior lamella wanting. Spiral lamella reduced 

 to a short plate deeply immersed, developed in a lateral position. 

 Inferior lamella appearing in a front view as a strong triangular 

 plate, strongly spiral within. Subcolumellar lamella very deeply

 A. N. S. P., No. 563 of Mr! Hirase's collection. 



This species is one of the most extraordinary modifications of the 

 Euphtedusan stock yet known. The large aperture resembles in 

 form that of no other Clavsilia known to me, and shows but one 

 lamella, the inferior; the superior lamella being wholly atrophied, 

 and the spiral lamella and principal plica reduced to short laminse 

 in the region where the clausilium lodges. There is no trace of a 

 lunella. The clausilium remains well developed, is slightly thick- 

 ened d'Stally, and has all the characters of that of Eujihccdusa. 



In the strong development of the inferior lamella, C. euholostmna 

 resembles C. Hungerjordkuui ISIlldfl". and C. monelasmm Pils., 

 which are likewise deficient in the superior lamella. C. euholo- 

 stoma agrees with the typical forms of Reinia in having the aper- 

 ture wide above, not piriform as in the group of C. Hunger- 

 fordiaua. It is intermediate between the two groups in number 

 of whorls and in general contour. 



Section REINIA Kobelt. 



Reinia Kob., Jahrb. d. D. Malak. Ges., Ill, 187G, p. 34, proposed as a 

 section of Balta ; type Balea variegata A. Ad. 



The type of Reinia is a small tapering-pupoid species, with 

 discontinuous peristome, the aperture being Buliminoid, deficient in 

 lamella and without pliccB, lunella or cla^l»ilium. It was included 

 by Bottger next to Balea; but that group as usuallj' constituted 

 consists of no less than three series of species, each totally dis- 

 tinct and unrelated. 



It was Dr. 0. von Mollendoi'ff who with keen Insight first 

 pointed out the fundamental distinction between Balea and 

 Reinia.' He recognized in the Chinese C. eastlakeana a less 

 modified form of Reinia, and after discussing the characters of the 

 group, declared it to be related to the eastern Asiatic group 

 Phcedum. The relation of Reinia to Phcedusa, von j\IolIeudorff 

 further held, is comparable to that of Alopia to the true ClausHia 

 of Europe: " Phylogenetisch diirfte Reinia als der lebende Kest 

 der Vorfahren der heutigen Phcedusa- Axien aufzufassen sein, wie

die Baleo-Clausilien die direkten nachkommen des Prototyps der 

 Europiiisehen Clausilien sind. "■* 



The conclusion that Reinia stands in close relationship with 

 Phcedusa, and has nothing to do with Balea, was forced upon 

 me by the study of a series of Japanese species, before I knew 

 that von Mollendorff, nearly twenty years ago, had been led to 

 the same result by the structure of a Chinese form. Only in one 

 point of view the data before me seem to modify the ideas of the 

 German savant: the Japanese series establishes such a connection 

 between Reinia and Eiiphcediisa that the descent of the former 

 from the latter is strongly indicated. Reinia is not a primitive 

 Phcedusa, but a degenerate one. I regard Reinia variegata aa the 

 secondarily simplified end of a series leading from typically 

 Euphsedusoid ancestors, just as Balea perversa is a secondarily sim- 

 plified, and not a primitive, Clausilia. The east Asiatic series 

 leads from forms with many whorls, well-developed clausilium, 

 lamelke and folds, and continuous peristome, to those with few 

 whorls, no clausilium, the lamelke and plicffi reduced and in part 

 lost, and the peristome adnate above and finally interrupted. 

 Bottger has demonstrated that the older tertiary Clausiliidae of 

 Europe had a narrow clausilium and the superior lamella was 

 continuous with the spiral lamella; the widening of the clausilium 

 and separation of the superior and spiral lamellae being modern 

 characters. Now Reinia and its nearest allies have the spiral 

 and superior lamellae interrupted, and the clausilium when devel- 

 oped is of the very broad type. These considerations seem to 

 render the hypothesis that Reinia is a primitive Phmdusa quite 

 inadmissible. 



The chief characters of Reinia and the Euphsedusoid forms 

 leading toward it, are stated in the following table: 



*i. c, p. 265.

It will be seen from the table and diagram that no sharp line 

 can be drawn between Reinia and Euplicedum. The number of 

 whorls varies, by easy stages ; the form of the aperture is not cor- 

 related with other characters; and upon the whole, it is obvious 

 that we have to deal with forms in vai'ious stages of change and of 

 degeneration of the closing- apparatus, from an Euphjedusoid ances- 

 tor. In fact, it is not quite certain that they had a single common 

 progenitor; they may be descendants from three species of EupJue- 

 dusa ; but however this may be, it is obvious that the original 

 stock, whether one or three, belonged to the aculus group of 

 Euphcedusa; and some apparently trivial features of the whole 

 series, such as the peculiar coloration, give me reason to believe 

 that the phylogeny indicated above is not far wrong.

This section is not aUied to Euphcedusa, as I formerly supposed,

 now comprises various shell- forms, especially among Chinese 

 species, and will probably require to be more or less subdivided.

The reference to plate in my former paper should read PL

 line from top, the lunella was stated to be " lateral, ' ' whereas it 

 is, in fact, nearly ventral. The same correction should be made in 

 the third line from bottom of same page. 



The systematic position of this species was left in doubt in mv 

 former paper; but further study inclines me to place a good deal 

 of weight upon the characters of the clausilium in deciding on the 

 classification of any Phsedusoid species; and this would throw 

 C. iotaptyx into my section TyrannopJuedusa. The definition of 

 that group must then be extended to include species with fewer 

 whorls, but having the same type of closing apparatus. As in C. 

 mikado, the upper half of the shell is attenuated.

Two specimens labeled as this species were transmitted to me 

 by Mr. E. K. Sykes. They formed part of Brigade- Surgeon 

 Hungerford's collection, and were taken by him near Kobi, 

 Japan, about twenty years ago. 



One of the specimens is slightly stouter and reddish, the other 

 more slender and pale }-elIowish green. I shall refer to them as 

 the reddish and the green examples. 



The green specimen (PI. XXVII, figs. 27-29) is slender, much 

 attenuated above, and has 9^ convex whorls. It is rather strongly, 

 regularly striate. The last whorl is somewhat cylindric, and on 

 its last half the space above the position of the principal plica is 

 distinctly swollen. The aperture is decidedly oblique and ovate ; and 

 from its obliquity appears abnormally short in tiie figures, from 

 being foreshortened. The peristome is rather widely reflexed, 

 shortly free, a little emargiuate above, and viewed from the base, 

 it is seen to be didinctly notched to the right of the superior lamella. 

 The superior lamella is marginal and slightly projecting, rather 

 short, and didinethj flat-topped ; continuous with the spiral lamella. 

 The inferior lamella is very receding, hardly visible in a front 

 view. Within it ascends straightly, is rather stout, and terminates 

 below in a perceptible "knot" or callous thickening. The 

 subeolumellar lamella is very deeply immersed, not visible within 

 the mouth. Both spiral and inferior lamellie ascend to a ventral 

 position, the former being higher in the region where the clausilium 

 lodges. The principal plica is visible within the aperture, and 

 penetrates to a lateral position, being thus fully a half-whorl long. 

 Below it there are four plic«, the upper and lower well devel- 

 oped; two very short, indistinct, minute callous nodules or plicse 

 lying between them.

This specimen agrees with von MollendorfPs description of C. 

 graeilispira in color and form, but differs in having fewer whorls, 

 9^ instead of 10-11, and in having two minute intermediate 

 palatal plicre instead of only one. Moreover, the lip is rather 

 broadly reflexed, not merely " breriter expansum." 



The reddish specimen (PL XXVII, figs. 32-34) is wider than 

 the green, with the space above the principal plica very convex 

 (fig. 34). Whorls Qh. The aperture is less oblique than in the 

 green specimen, but otherwise similar; the oblique flattening of 

 the top of the superior lamella, and the notch in the peristome to 

 the right of it being well marked. Internally it is similar to the 

 green specimen except in the following respects: the spiral and 

 inferior lamellae are longer, ascending almost past the ventral 

 position ; and between the upper and lower palatal plicas there is 

 one very low, nodule-like callus or intermediate plica. 



Length 10, diam. 2.2 mm. 



This specimen agrees with von IMollendorfTs description in 

 having an identical palatal armature. In color and general 

 appearance it is a good deal like C. aurantiaca var. Erberi Bttg. 

 I did not examine the clausilium. The rather peculiar form of 

 the superior lamella, in a front view, is the same in the two speci- 

 mens; and when the intermediate palatal plicae are so reduced as 

 in these shells, I am disposed to believe that the diflerences above 

 recorded are not of specific value. 



It is obvious, however, that more material is needed to satisfac- 

 torily elucidate the characters of the species. 



Group of C. sublunellata. 



This group was defined by von Miilleudorff in 1885. It is 

 characterized by the palatal ai'mature, the species examined by 

 him having " below the principal plait, first an upper palatal, after 

 this a very short second one, and then a short, straight lunella, 

 which in some forms is somewhat obsolete, but always discernible." 



In my opinion the group should be enlarged to include species 

 which have below the principal plica or plait, one upper jsalatal 




478 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF ['Inly^ 



plica, followed by a straight iuneUa, or a short, low callous uodule 

 representing the lunella. There is no lower palatal plica, nor 

 inward curve of the lower end of the luneUa, representing such 

 plica. 



Since the lunella is a secondary evolution-product, formed by 

 the coalescence of primitive palatal jilicfe, it is natural that species 

 representing certain intermediate stages should occur.

A specimen from Hungerford's collection, doubtless one of the 

 original lot, was kindly lent me by Mr. E. R. Sykes. On account 

 of its relationship with the following species, figures and descrip- 

 tive notes are here given. It has not before been figured. 



The pale buff, slender shell is attenuated above, and consists of 

 nearly 9, moderately convex whorls. It is delicately costulate- 

 striate. The apertui-e is piriform-ovate, with moderately reflexed 

 lip, which is quite deeply emarginate above. The superior lamella 

 is vertical, rather slender and high, marginal, and continuous with 

 the sj)iral lamella. The inferior lamella is deeply receding, not 

 visible from in front. Within it ascends straightly. The snb- 

 columellar lamella is wholly immersed. Within, the spiral and 

 inferior lamellpe are of equal length, ascending to a point on the 

 ventral side just above the superior lamella. The principal phca 

 is rather short, not quite a half-whorl long, its lower end visible 

 deep within the throat, whence it extends almost past a strictly 

 lateral position. Below it there is a rather long upper palatal 

 plica, and then a very low, rather wide and straight lunella. Xo 

 lower palatal plica. 



The long, narrow clausilium (PI. XXVIII, figs. 44-46) is 

 parallel-sided, slightly acuminate below, and not emarginate pos- 

 teriorly. 



Length 10.5, diam. 2 mm. 



In this specimen the lunella is apparently better developed than 

 in that opened by Dr. von Molleudorff, who in his first description 

 states that there is a short upper i)alatal plica and sometimes a 

 second punctiform one, the latter evidently being the vestige of a 

 lunella. In his second article he finds " that there is an indica- 

 tion of a lunella below the second (generally punctiform) palatal 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 479 



plait." Ill the specimen before me, the structure is clearly as 

 described aliove and figured on my plate. When low, ill-developed 

 or " punctiform," these palatal structures are doubtless subject to a 

 somewhat wide range of variation, although the difference between 

 a " puuctiform plica with the Indication of a lunella, " and a 

 "low, ill-defined lunella" occupying the same position, appears 

 greater in the statement than the structure itself. 



Compared with C. perpaUida, this species differs in having the 

 principal plica longer, and the superior lamella a little more 

 prominent. The striation is also a trifle coarser, and the form 

 more cylindric, less tapering. These differences do not seem to 

 me to be of specific importance.

 C. perpaUida Fila., Nautilus, XIV, p. 108 (January, 1901). 



Shell rimate, slenderly fusiform, finely and distinctly striate, 

 pale corneous. Apex obtuse, the first whorl globose; spire some- 

 what attenuated above. Whorls 9^, convex, the sutures impressed, 

 last whorl but slightly narrower than the penultimate, somewhat 

 compressed. Aperture piriform, slightly oblique, with rather 

 distinct, slightly retracted sinulus. Peristome somewhat thick- 

 ened, reflexed, continuous. Superior lamella vertical, coutiuuous 

 with the spiral lamella, arising at the edge of the parietal lip. 

 Inferior lamella deeply receding, visible only in an oblique view, 

 within straightened and thickened below. Both the spiral and the 

 inferior lamellre penetrate inwardly to a fully ventral position, 

 and are of about equal length ; the former becoming very high 

 for a short distance, just within the position of the palatal arma- 

 ture. Subcolumellar lamella is deeply immersed and either not 

 visible within the aperture, or showing the end ouly in an oblique 

 view. Principal plica less than a half- whorl long, the end visible 

 within the aperture, inner end extending a little beyond a short, 

 slightly curved, or forwardly diverging lateral upper palatal plica; 

 below this, and not connected with it there is a low callous pad 

 representing the lunella; no lower palatal fold. Clausilium long, 

 slender and paralJel-sided, somewhat acuminate toward the apex, 

 tapering to the filament, the sides and apex thin ; in profile seen 

 to be curved, bow-like.

I at first identified this species with C. irjnohilis Sykes/ described 

 from Kinaayama, Shikoku Island, but upon requesting a com- 

 parison with the t3'pe of that species, Mr. Sykes noted several 

 important differences. The first two or three whorls in C. ignobllis 

 are much larger, not so slender and pointed as in C. pervjnobilk ; 

 and the lunella is bow-shaped, as in C. shikohiensis, not J-shaped. 



In other words, the lunella in irjnohUm and shikokuensis unites 

 with the lower, outer end of the upper palatal plica, curving 

 gradually and imperceptibly into it, the united plica and lunella 

 having the shape of a drawn bow, while in C. peririnohUh the 

 lunella unites with the middle of the upper palatal plica, like the 

 letter J. 



In C. perif/nobiUi the spiral and inferior lamellae are both high 

 and lamellar within, of equal length, attaining barely a ventral 

 position. The inferior lamella ascends rather straightly, and is 

 not spiral, seen from the back in a broken specimen, but is rather 

 thick. It gives otf a branch toward the superior lamella, on the 

 parietal wall.

Shell rimate, strong, the last two whorls of about equal diameter, 

 and forming half the shell's length, those above rapidly diminish- 

 ing, the lateral outlines becoming somewhat concave toward the 

 apex, the earlier three whorls being of about equal diameter; dark 

 reddish brown, with a pale band below the suture, the earliest 

 whorls white. Surface usually with a brilliant gloss, sculptured 

 xvith coarse, stromj, sliijhthj tvaved or uneven ribs, which occa- 

 sionally anastomose or branch, and become finer on the upper, 

 imperceptible on the earliest whorls. Whorls Hi to 12, but 

 several are self-amputated in old individuals; they are convex and 

 parted by well-impressed sutures. The last whorl, viewed dorsaUy, 

 is narrower than the swollen preceding whorl, and is rather com- 

 pressed, hardly convex. Aperture rhombic-ovate, vertical; peris- 

 tome continuous, reflexed, flesh-tinted, whitish at the edge. Supe- 

 rior lamella small, marginal, oblique, continuous with the spiral 

 lamella. Inferior lamella low and receding, within rather 

 straightly ascending and strongly thickened below. Subcolumellar 

 lamella deeply immersed, not visible in a front view, but its end 

 may be seen by looking obliquely into the aperture. Principal 

 plica short, its lower end visible deep within the aperture, upper 

 end scarcely extending inward beyond the palatal armature. 

 Palatal plica; or folds lying a little dorsal of a lateral position, 

 four in number, equidistant, all strongly developed though short; 

 the upper fold a little longer, diverging from the principal jjlica, 

 the lower (fourth) fold slightly longer than the two median, and a

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF ROBERT HENRY LAMBORN. 

 BY CARRIE B. AAROX. 



At Hornblue Hill, Chester countj-, Pa., not far from the his- 

 toric Kennett, whose beauties have heea the theme of Bayard 

 Taylor's pen, Eohert Henry Lamborn was born, October 29, 1835. 



His boyhood was spent in the home of his fathers, and he was 

 thus surrounded by the advantages of inherited prosperity. His 

 father was a member of the Society of Friends, and was an intel- 

 ligent man of refined tastes, a close observer, a bright conversa- 

 tionalist and a wide reader. The sou inherited his prepossessing 

 appearance, courteous manner, dignified bearing and agreeable 

 disposition. 



Younsr Lamburn's education was sriven a scientific turn bv the 

 influence and patronage of his uncle, Jacob Pierce, who served as 

 Librarian of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelpliia from 

 December, 1817, to December, 1826, and who, in the early days 

 of the institution, had, at one time, all its collections stored ia 

 one of his spare back rooms. No doubt the youth received his 

 first inspiration for " collecting " while in such environment. 



After receiving a common-school education and a special train- 

 ing at the Polytechnic College in Philadelphia, he determined to 

 continue his studies in cinl engineering abroad. He secured means 

 to do so by the publication of original essays on the metallurgy of 

 copper, silver and lead,' works which, although long superseded, 

 were considered ably written and used as lext-books both here and 

 abroad. He became a student of the Roval Saxon ^Mining Acad- 

 emy of Freiberg, and the School of Jlines in Paris, graduating 

 from the University of Giessen, from which he later received tlie 

 degree of Doctor of Philosophy. 



Soon after the outbreak of the Civil War, Dr. Lamborn returned 

 from Europe and joined the army, serving with the Anderson

•Cavalry at the Battle of Aatietam, undei* Captaia Palmer. He 

 became captain on the stafi of Gen. John F. Reynolds in 1862. 



After the war he was twice elected City Surveyor of Treuton, 

 N. J. He was engineer in charge of fuel and iron rails on the 

 Pennsylvania Railroad when coal was displacing wood as fuel for 

 engines, and steel was finally supplanting iron. He was Secretary 

 of the American Iron and Steel Association at the period of its 

 development into an institution of national importance, and when 

 the r)ublication of iron and steel statistics became a necessity. He 

 was Secretary, Treasurer and Director of the first railroad to con- 

 nect the Mississippi river and Lake Superior, and founder, Treas- 

 urer and Director of the Western Land Association, which began 

 the building up of Duluth when the town consisted of but seven 

 houses. He was made President and Director of the National 

 Land Improvement Company. He participated in founding the 

 towns of Colorado Springs and ^lanitou, and in colonizing the 

 country at the base of Pike's Peak. 



Early in his career, while residing in Pittsburg, where he was 

 appointed the first chemical expert for the Pennsylvania Railroad, 

 Dr. Lamborn became acquainted with Mr. Andrew Carnegie and 

 others who have done so much for the development of the indus- 

 trial resources of western Pennsylvania, with whom he maintained 

 a life-long friendship. Mr. Carnegie writes of him: "As a 

 young man he was thoroughly practical, quiet, reserved, dignified, 



eminently scientific He wore kid gloves, which were then 



rare in western Pennsylvania; this fact rendered him somewhat 

 an object of suspicion at first, something rather efieminate ; one 

 had only to know him to see how he survived his kid gloves. Year 

 after year he gained more and more the respect and confidence of 

 all of us, and finally became a friend and one of the circle whose 

 loss was deeply deplored." 



Dr. Lamborn, as General Manager of various Western rail- 

 ways, introduced the first coke blast furnaces and the first Besse- 

 mer ?teel ingot and rail works west of the Missouri river. 



While engaged in extensive railroad and mining interests, he 

 lost no opportunity of studying the cliS" dwellers and other primi- 

 tive inhabitants, making at the same time collections of pottery 

 and ethnological objects which he presented to various institutions. 



While in Mexico he devoted much attention to the art of that 




488 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Julv, 



countr}^ subsequently publishing his observations in 1891 under 

 the title, Mexican Paintings and Painters, Bouton, N. Y. The 

 Lamboru Collection in Memorial Hall, Philadelphia, contains the 

 material secured in Mexico, as well as many specimens gathered 

 in Europe to illustrate the history of civilization in the Italian 

 Peninsula, beginning with relics from the prehistoric Terra ^Mane 

 period and from the almost prehistoric Etruscan times. 



While engaged in building the Lake Superior Railroad, Dr. 

 Lamborn suffered so from the attacks of countless mosquitos, that 

 he became interested in extermination of the insect, and later 

 offered prizes for the three best essays on the subject. These were 

 published under the tiile Dragonflies vs. Mosquitos: The Lamborn 

 Prise Essays, D. Applcton, New York, 1890. 



As a beekeeper Dr. Lamborn will long be remembered by many 

 friends who had received from him colonies of Italian bees. He 

 enjoyed the careful study of the social organization of a hive, 

 his special interest being the development of a stingless bee. AVhile 

 intent upon these investigations his identity as a railroad magnate 

 would be quite lost under his bee hat and veil. 



While the name of Robert H. Lamborn will not be found 

 reconled among those of the great scientists of the world, his 

 environments, the natural bent of his mind, his broad views of 

 life, together with an executive and business ability far beyond the 

 average, constituted a unique personality. His interests in miuiug 

 and metals and the demands of business made him a constant 

 traveler over large areas. It was thus impossible for him to give 

 the sustained attention necessary to effectively cultivate the many 

 subjects of natural history which he loved, and in which he might 

 have become eminent if his interests had been more concentrated. 



Philadelphia was his favorite city. During the last years of his 

 life he retained here a domicile, and would probably have made 

 his home here had his life been prolonged. 



Dr. Lamborn expressed his opinions of the unequal distribution 

 of wealth in a manner which showed his altruistic notions as to 

 the power and influence of money when used proiluctively. He 

 believed that great fortunes should be regarded as capital in ti-ust 

 for the permanent benefit of society, and that the owner of a large 

 amount of money could erect no better monument to himself, than 

 by systematically employing a great number of persons with the 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF THILADELPHIA. 489 



aim of improving tlieir social couflitions. He was opposed to 

 indiscriminate charity, regarding it as one of the causes of 

 pauperism and the natural demoralization which is the usual 

 result of receiving something for nothing. 



That Dr. Lamborn recognized the institutions which foster the 

 various branches of science as fitting beneficiaries of his wealth was 

 evidenced by the placing of his collections of archa2ulogical books, 

 ethnological objects, Etruscan relics, Mexican pottery, etc., where, 

 free to the public, they may be used for reference and instruction 

 as additions to the educational resources of the several repositories. 

 He advocated the opening of all museums, parks, art galleries 

 and places of healthful recreation to the public on Sunday, that 

 all might be brought in contact with the beautiful in nature and 

 with man's best handiwork. He placed none of his collections in 

 any museum which exacted an admission fee. 



Although Dr. Lamborn was a man of large means, he fre- 

 quently suggested money-making schemes to young people whom 

 he wished to employ, by offering work on a profit-sharing basis, 

 his object being to engage the earnest attention of students and 

 to develop a love of research, ends more likely to be secured by 

 copartnership than by patronage. As an incentive to study, he 

 frequently offered prizes of money for the investigation of vari- 

 ous scientific questions, his interest being especially in the direction 

 of the cultivation of bees and flowers, 



Shortly before his deatli Dr. Lamborn placed a sum of money 

 with the President of Swartlimore College to be jjaid in prizes for 

 the two clearest and most useful essays upon the theme, " What 

 important inventions, discoveries, observations, ideas or acts tend- 

 ing to advance civilization have been contributed by members of 

 the Society of Friends, or by persons descended from members of 

 that Society, or by persons guided or employed by such members, 

 with an estimate of the number of members composing the Society 

 each twenty years since its foundation." Some essays were 

 written in response but have not been published. 



During the greater part of his active life Dr. Lamborn was 

 conscious of the existence of organic cardiac weakness, which, it 

 is believed, deterred him from marrying, and resulted in his sud- 

 den death in New Yoi^, after a slight, apparently trivial, indispo- 

 sition, January 14, 1895. 




490 PROCEEDINGS Oi' THE ACADEMY OF [Julj, 



Dr. Lamborn's success in life was due to his persisteut efforts to 

 master difficulties, the possession of the loftiest aims and an invin- 

 cible purpose of acting for the right. , 



All knowledge -which he acquired by personal research or through 

 his patronage of students he cheerfully gave to the world. Science 

 has been enriched by his benefactions to the several institutions in 

 which his library and collections have been placed. 



His special interest in the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, his devotion to its objects and his ajiproval of its 

 administratiou have been most practically indicated by the terms 

 of his last will which left to the Society without conditions his 

 entire estate for the advancement of its work in biology and 

 anthropology. Although, because of a legal technicality — a ques- 

 tion of domicile and a provision of New York law which seems to 

 have been framed solely for the benefit of lawyers — liis benevo- 

 lent intention has not been entirely fulfilled, the portion of his 

 estate of which the Academy has become possessed by an agree- 

 ment with the heirs-at-law, forms a most important addition to its 

 resources and will enable the Society to effect such development in 

 the departments indicated as will constitute a lasting memorial of 

 its generous benefactor, who, by the magnitude of his gift, stands 

 first among the many earnest men devoted to the advancement of 

 knowledge who have substantially manifested their interest in its 

 well-being. 



]\Iiss Anna Wharton, in the following ode, has briefly given 

 expression to the feelings of many who hold Dr. Lamboru in 

 grateful and appreciative memory : 



Esteem he won from many loyal friends, 



To whom his well-stored mind and humor keen, 

 His fjeneroiis heart, where kindly traits convene. 



Had drawn him Ijy that bond which nothing: rends. 



And DOW where his remerahered image blends 

 With throngin}; shadows of the world unseen, 

 That honored ligure of the stately mien 



Is crowned with light which grateful memory lends. 



His life so full of thought and e£Eort high. 



Brought that success which i-* to sloth unknown, 



But as he had not formed that dearer tie 



Which makes a home and kindred of one's own, 



There at the last no helping hand was nigh, 

 No love to soothe him, and he died alone.

492 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [AugUSt, 



A NEW SPECIES OF COLUBER FROM WESTERN TEXAS. 

 BY AKTHUR ERWIN BROWN. 



On June 18 a large and handsome Coluber was received at the 

 Zoological Gardens from Mr. E. Meyenberg, a resident collector 

 of the Society at Pecos, Texas, which both in color and scutellation 

 differs greatly from any species of the genus previously collected in 

 the United States. 



The locality of its capture was given by Jlr. Meyenberg as the 

 Davis Mountains, fifty miles southwest of Pecos, near the head of 

 Toy ah creek. 



As it seemed unlikely that so large and striking a snake could 

 have hitherto escaped notice in a region comparatively well known 

 to collectors, description of the .species was withheld and a liberal 

 reward ^vas offered for additional specimens, the fortunate result of 

 which has been the receipt on August 13 of two younger, living 

 snakes from the same locality, presenting similar characters, and 

 a fourth specimen on August 16. 



All doubt as to the fixed characters ami the place of origin of 



thesp snakes being removed, the species is here described: 



t 

 Coluber subocularis ^r- nov. I'late XXIX. 



Specific characters: Head broad and flat on top. Body stout. 

 Tail short. Rostral broad and low. A row of small accessory 

 plates below the eye and jireocular. Preocular in contact with 

 the frontal. Temporals small and numerous. Scales in 31-35 

 rows. Anal divided. Body color yellow, with a series of black 



H-shaped dorsal blotches with pale cen- 

 tres, the lateral arms being continued 

 by a paler shade, and forming a pair 

 of longitudinal stripes. Head and belly 

 unmarked. 



Type specimen. No. 13,733 Acad- 

 emy Collection, from the Davis Mountains, Jeflf. Davis county, 

 Texas. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 493 



In the type specimen, which is adult, the head is broad, flat on 

 top and distinct from the neck, which is rather slender; the body 

 is stout and the tail a little less than one-eighth of the total 

 length. 



Rostral nearly twice as broad as high, barely visible from above. 

 Internasals narrow in front, half the length of prefrontals. One 

 pair of prefrontals. Frontal rather broad behind, one-third longer 

 than ils greatest breadth, the anterior corners cut oflf to form an 

 oblique suture with the preocular. Suture between the parietals 

 equals the length of the frontal, or the distance between the frontal 

 and rostral. Two large nasals, the nostril between them, situated 

 high up and directed rather upward. Loreal longer than high, 

 its upper border sloping downward and backward. One large 

 preocular, reaching the frontal. In each of the specimens a row 

 of two or three small accessory plates more or less completely sepa- 

 rates the eye, the preocular and the hinder end of the loreal from 

 tne labials, but they present variations in detail. The type has 

 9 upper labials on one side, and there are three accessory plates, the 

 first lying on the 3d aud 4th, the second on the 4th and 5th, and 

 the third oa the oth labial; on the other side there are 11 labials, 

 the first accessory lying ou the 4th and oth, the second on the 5th 

 and 6th, and the third on the Oth, the labials being wholly ex- 

 cluded from the orbit on both sides. The largest of the smaller 

 specimens has 10 labials on each side, aud the accessory plates are 

 as in the type. In the third specimen there are 11 labials on each 

 side, on one of which only the two anterior accessory plates are 

 present, and the sixth labial enters the orbit behind them; on the 

 other side, the 6th labial also reaches the eye, and all three 

 accessory plates are present, but the two hinder are small and are 

 puslied forward. In the smallest specimen the labials ou one side 

 are 10, the first aud second accessory plates only are present, 

 permitting the fifth labial to enter the eye; on the other side, the 

 labials are 11, and the three plates completely shut out the 

 labials, as in the type and the second specimen. Three postocu- 

 lars, the inferior extending forward under the eye. The temporals 

 are small and irregular, from 3 to 5 in the first row. iower 

 labials 14, the hinder ones small and scale-like. Five lower 

 labials in contact with the anterior chin shields; the hinder pair 

 shorter and widely separated. 




494 PEOCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [AugUSt, 



Scales in 33 rows, with two pits: the outer row very slightly 

 enlarged; 27 to 29 rows faintly keeled. 



Ventrals 270; anal divided; subcaudals 70 pairs. 



Total length 1,590 mm. (tail 190). 



Color bright yellowish buff, with an orange tinge anteriorly; 

 head more ashy, without markings on top or sides. Two very dis- 

 tinct black stripes, two or three scales wide, separated by three and 

 two half rows, begin on the neck and run back to the tail, becom- 

 ing blackish brown posteriorly. At intervals of about eight scales 

 they are connected by narrow crossbars of the same color, the 

 first of which is about three inches behind the head. The stripes 

 ai'e at first jet black, but after a short distance the portion mid- 

 way between the crossbars fades to maroon, leaving the black 

 sections outlined as a series of H-shaped dorsal blotches, the cen- 

 tres of both the crossbars and the lateral arms being puler. Tliere 

 are 24 of these spots on the body and 8 on the tail, where they 

 lose much of their characteristic shape. On each side is a row of 

 ill-defined, cloudy spots, rather higher than long, extending to the 

 ends of the ventrals; they mostlj- alternate with the dorsal spots, 

 but an occasional one is opposite. Traces of a short, broken black 

 line on the sides of the neck suggest a second stripe parallel to 

 that on the back. Belly white with a faint yellowisli tinge, 

 unmarked, except for a dusky shade on the suture between tiie 

 subcaudals, and a cloudy spot on the hinder margin of each scutum 

 on the anterior half of the tail. Chin and throat pure wliite. 



The above color description was taken from the tyj)e in life, 

 when freshly caught, but much of the intensity has akeady faded, 

 after two weeks' immersion in spirits. 



The largest of the three specimens now living in the Zoological 

 Society's collection measures 915 mm. (tail 125). It has 35 rows 

 of scales, of which about 15 are very faintly keeled. As 

 nearly as it is possible to count them in a living snake, the ven- 

 trals are about 240; subcaudals about 77. There are 25 dorsal 

 spots and 8 on the tail, and the body color is paler and more ashy 

 than in the type. 



Tlf8 third specimen is 684 mm. long (tail 98) ; the scales are in 

 31 rows, about 13 of which are faintly keeled; ventrals about 

 245; subcaudals about 68. The color is similar to the la?t 

 described, but there is a small dusky spot at each of the anterior 




1901.] NATURAL SCIE^X'ES OF PHILADELPHIA. 495 



and lateral angles of the frontal plate. There is the same number 

 of dorsal spots as in the type. 



The fourth example is 472 mm. long (tail 67); scales in 31 

 rows, of which 15 are keeled; ventrals about 240; subcaudals 

 about 63. The color is very similar to the type, but less intense, 

 and there are but 20 dorsal spots on the body, v/ith 8 on the tail. 



In all the young individuals the light portion of the dorsal 

 stripes, continuing the lateral arms of the H-shaped spots, is less 

 distinct than in the adult, and the whole under surface is pearly 

 white, with indications of the cloudy markings under the tail ; the 

 carination of the dorsal scales is .so indistinct that it is hard to 

 determine its exact extent. 



The bright colore and the strong contrasts shown in life by the 

 adults, render this one of the most beautiful of North American 

 snakes. The pattern on the dorsal region is simply the extreme 

 development of the tendency toward longitudinal extension of the 

 corners of the spots, which is shown at times in some other species, 

 such as C. obsoletus confinls, which occasionally exhibits even the 

 neck-bands. It is also suggested on the forepart of the body in 

 C. lineaticoUis Cope, but from these it differs widely in scutella- 

 tion, and its real relations are with the section of Coluber repre- 

 sented by the jMexican C. triaspis and C. mutabilis, which tend in 

 the direction of the nearly related genus Pityophis through P. 

 vertebralis, from which, however, it is abundantly distinguished by 

 the generic characters and by the curious fact that the color shading 

 is completely reversed, the spots in C. subocularis being black 

 anteriorly and fading toward the tail, while in all sj)ecies of 

 Pityophis the exact 02:)posite occurs. 




496 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [A.UgUSt, 



NOTICES OF NEW LAND SNAILS FKOM THE JAPANESE EMPIRE. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY'. 



Continuing his zoological researches in the islands south of 

 Kiusiu, Mr. Hirase has had the two principal islands of the 

 " Xortheastern group " of the Loo Choo chain explored for land 

 snails. These islands, Tane-ga-shima and Yaku-no-shima (Yaku- 

 shima), belong politically to the Province of Osumi, and hence in 

 Japan are not ordinarily included in the Loo Choo Islands. I 

 shall discuss their fauual relations more fully at another time, but 

 it may be said here that while there is one species of land snail, 

 Troehomorpha Gouldiana Pils., identical with a species of Oshima, 

 the rest of the fauna, though composed almost wholly of endemic 

 species, is more nearly related to that of Kiusiu than to the Loo 

 Choo fauna proper. 



OYCLOPHORIDiE. 

 Spiropoma Nakadai n, sp. 



Shell discoidal, with very wide, bowl-shaped umbilicus, and 

 nearly flat spire, except that the first whorl projects when not worn; 

 solid, yellowish-brown, rather dull, sculptured with slight growth- 

 lines only. Whorls 4^, convex, the last one very deeply descend- 

 ing in front. Aperture quite oblique, nearly circular, the peris- 

 tome built forward, becoming free from the preceding whorl, and a 

 little contracted. Diam. 10, alt. 4.8 mm.; diam. 9, alt. 

 4.7 mm. 



Tane-ga-shima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 658). 



In the larger S. japonieum the last whorl descends much less in 

 front; the peristome is expanded and not so much, usually not at 

 all, l)uilt forward. It is named for Mr. Nakada, an earnest and 

 successful collector for ^Mr. Hirase. 



Spiropoma is a new name recently substituted for Cvclopoma, 

 which was found to be preoccupied. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 497 



Pupinella rufa var. tanegashimae aov. 



Smaller than P. rufa from Hondo, Awaji or Kiusiu, or the 

 Tsushima or Iki forms ; whorls 6 ; peristome very heavy. Alt. 

 9.5, diam. above aperture 4.3 mm.; alt. 8.3, diam. 4 mm. 



Pupinella Funatoi n. sji. 



This species differs from P. rufa in being much smaller, with only 

 oh whorls, the spire more abruptly tapering above; more solid; 

 darker colored. The aperture is vertical, the lower margin not in 

 the least carried forward as it is in P. rufa. The whole peristome 

 is exceedingly thick and strong, with an inner elevated rim about 

 the orifice. The posterior orifice is not channel-like; and the 

 columellar orifice is a small slit, which does not deeply penetrate 

 the lip, as it does in P. rufa. A glossy callus spreads much fur- 

 ther up on the ventral face of the whorl than in P. rufa. Length 

 7Jt, diam. above aperture 3i mm. 



Tane-ga-shima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 665a). 



It seems curious that there should be a slightly differentiated 

 race of the widespread P. rufi, and a well-characterized species 

 of the same genus, on so small an island as Tane-ga-shima. This 

 species is named for Mr. Funato, one of the efficient assistants who 

 have enabled Mr. Hirase to make such notable additions to our 

 knowledge of Japanese mollusks. 



Diplommatina tanegashimae a- sp. 



Shell small, obese, pupiform, light red, composed of B^ convex 

 whorls, the penultimate whorl widest, those above tapering regu- 

 larly; last whorl much contracted. Sculpture of widely spaced, 

 delicate riblets on the spire, the last two whorls with very much 

 finer, far closer rib-stri:v. Aperture circular, the peristome ex- 

 panded, thickened within, slightly duplicate. Columellar tooth 

 strong and acute; palatal plica short, distinct, situated above the 

 columella. Length 2.6, diam. 1.6 mm. 



Tane-ga-shima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No, 668). 



Somewhat allied to D. saginata, of Oshima. 



HELICINID^. 

 Helicina yaeyamensis u. sp. 



Shell very small for the genus, thin, rather pale red, dull, 

 faintly marked with growth-lines, and a few spiral striie are 

 usually developed ; shaped like H. verecunda. Whorls 4i, con- 

 32 




498 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [AugUSt, 



vex, the last rounded at the periphery, a little compressed above 

 and below. Aperture oblique, semicircular, the outer lip simple, 

 unexpanded, not thickened. Umbilical callus whitish, rather large 

 and densely pitted. Alt. 2.2, diam. 3.3 mm. 



Yaeyama, in the southwestern group of the Loo Choo Islands 

 (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 624). Types No. 80,967 Coll. A. N. S. P. 



About half the dimensions of H. verecunda of Okinawa, but 

 with the same number of whorls, and a simple, unexpanded lip. 

 I at first supposed the specimens were young, but the receipt of a 

 second lot from Mr. Hirase, agreeing in size and other characters 

 with the first, indicates that they are full grown. 



ZONITID^. 

 UicTocystina Hiraseana n. j^p. 



Shell trochiform, with minute, nearly covered perforation; 

 brown, glossy and smooth, slightly transparent. The periphery 

 has a narrow, acute, projecting keel, visible in the suture above. 

 Spire conic, the apex obtuse. Whorls 5|, quite convex ; base con- 

 vex, narrowly impressed in the centre. Ajierture shaped like a 

 crescent with truncate ends, slightly oblique; peristome simple and 

 acute, the columellar margin reflexed at the perforation, thickened 

 within with a white callus, sometimes sinuous. Alt. 3, diam. 

 3.5 mm. 



Tane-ga shima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 607). 



This species resembles 3f. ceratodes (Gude) in general features, 

 but is more elevated, with more exserted keel, a less varnish-hke 

 gloss, and more closely coiled whorls. 



Maorochlamys tanegashimse n. sp. 



Shell small, depressed, minutely perforate, smooth and glossy, 

 rich brown, somewhat translucent. Spire low-conoidal, obtuse at 

 the apex. Whorls Ah, moderately convex, rather closely revolving, 

 appressed at the suture, which appears margined; the last whorl 

 nearly double the width of the preceding, rounded at the periphery, 

 moderately convex beneath. Aperture crescentic, slightly oblique, 

 the lip simple and thin, abruptly reflexed at the columellar inser- 

 tion. Alt. nearly 2, diam. 3.8 mm. 



Tane-ga-shima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 666). 

 About the size and general appearance of the shell I called 

 Vitreu harimemis, but which I subse<iueully decided to be young 




1901.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 499 



Macroclilamys Doenitzi (Reinh.); but the species from Tane-ga- 

 shima has a narrower umbilical perforation, and the spire is more 

 developed, with an additional whorl. 



CLAUSILIID^. 

 Clausilia oscariana n. sp. 



Shell fusiform, rather slender, not subject to truncation, brown, 

 finely striate, the last whorl more coarsely so. Whorls lOi to Hi, 

 the upper part of the spire decidedly attenuated. Aperture piri- 

 form, the peristome thickened and refiexed, with several more or 

 less distinct folds on its face, adjacent to the subcolumellar lamella. 

 Superior lamella rather small, oblique, not connected with the 

 spiral lamella. Inferior lamella deeply receding, straightened and 

 subvertically ascending within. Subcolumellar lamella emerging. 

 Principal plica long. Lunella curved inward above, straightened 

 and connected with a short palatal plica below, being thus shaped 

 like an inverted letter J. Length 12-14.5, diam. 2.8-3.3 mm. 



Fukuregi, Province of Higo, Kiusiu (Mr. Y. Hirase, 'So. 674). 



This Hemiphiedu-ia belongs to the group of C. pUcilabrk A. 

 Ad. (bilabrata Smith), but this is a much smaller species and 

 differs in various structural characters. It is named in honor 

 of Dr. Oscar Boettger, the acute and lucid master in the study of 

 Claxisiliidoe. 



Clausilia liigoensis n. sp. 



Shell fusiform, ver\' much attenuated above, brown, finely 

 striate, the last whorl tapering. Whorls 10, the last more coarsely 

 striate dorsally, having a low, inconspicuous wave or prominence 

 behind the outer lip. Aperture piriform, the peristome slightlv 

 reflexed, somewhat thickened. Superior lamella rather small, 

 oblique, marginal, continuous with the spiral lamella. Inferior 

 lamella deeply receding, rather straightly ascending inside. Sub- 

 columellar lamella immersed, or nearly emerging. Principal plica 

 extending beyond the lateral lunella. Lunella stronglv curved 

 inward below, straightened above, where it joins the middle of a 

 short, oblique upper palatal plica. Length 14-15, diam. 3.7- 

 3.8 mm. 



Mldumate, Province of Higo, Kiusiu (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 

 677). 



A species of the Hemiphffidusan group of C. awajiensis, perig- 




500 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [AugUSt, 



nobilis, etc., more attenuated above than any of the known species 

 except C. mvajiensis, which is a more obese form with narrow lip 

 and emerging subcolumellar lamella. 



Clausilia isohna n. sp. 



A slender and elongate member of the group of C. awajietuis, 

 the length five times the greatest diameter; rather thin, brown, 

 with about Hi whorls; finely striate. Aperture small, the peri- 

 stome reflexed, rather narrow. Superior lamella compressed, 

 oblique, continuous with the spiral lamella. Inferior lamella very 

 deeply receding. Subcoluiuellar lamella deeply immersed. Lu- 

 nella curved inward below, straightened above, and connected with 

 a short, oblique upper palatal plica, being shaped like the letter 

 J. Length 16.5, diam. 3 to 3.3 mm. 



Kochi, Tosa (Mr. Y. Hirase, Xo. 657a). 



More slender than any other known species of the grouji of C 

 aivajiensis. 



Clausilia ischna var. neptis niiv. 



Paler, nearly corneous or whitish; less slender, the last whorl 

 more coarsely striate; peristome broader; sinulus more retracted. 

 Whorls 11. Length 15.5 to Ifi. 5, diam. 3.5 mm. 



Occurred with the preceding.

 16^ mm. 



Tane-ga-shima (Mr. Y. Hirase, Xo. 662). 



The HemiplKeduscB of the northeastern Loo Choo Islands belong 

 to several groups special to those islands. The group of C. tane- 

 gashiniiz has the internal structure of the plieikibris group, but 

 there is a strong wave or crest behind the outer lip parallel with it. 

 The shell is very solid and strong. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 501 



Clausilia ptyohocyma n. sp.

 Length 11, diam. 3 mm. 



Tane-ga-shima (^Ir. Y. Hirase, No. Cr)4a). 



Clausilia ptyohocyma var. yakushimae nov. 



Wrinkles on the latter part of the last whorl more numerous 

 and less prominent; superior lamella often subobsolete; subcolu- 

 mellar lamella less deeply immersed, or emerging. Lunella more 

 distinct. 



Yakushima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 6646). 



The following species belong to another group of Hemiphtedusa, 

 characterized by the very strongly spiral inferior lamella. 



Clausilia entospira n. sp. 



Fusiform, rather slender, yellowish, smooth, the latter half of 

 last whorl coarsely striate, whorls about 8^, moderately convex. 

 Aperture small; peristome narrowly reflexed, very much thick- 

 ened, flattened. Superior lamella small, remote from the spiral 

 lamella. Inferior lamella forming a prominent, heavy fold rather 

 deep within the mouth, strongly spiral within the last whorl. 

 Subcolumellar lamella immersed. Lunella very strong, strongly 

 curved inward below, straight above. No palatal plicse except the 

 principal plica. Length 10, diam. 2i mm.

curving inward at its lower end, being shaped like the letter J. 

 Length tt.3, diam. 2.4 mm. 



Tane-ga-shima (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 663 J. 



This species looks like a Zapfyx, but wants the accessory lamellae 

 and plicte of that group. I am disposed to consider it a degener- 

 ate member of that subgenus. Otherwise, the receding inferior 

 lamella would cause it to be ranked as a Hemipluedusa. 



Clausilia (Stereopliaedasa) stereoma n. sp. 



Excessively strong, glossy, olive-yellow, weakly striate ; very 

 obeso below, the upper third very much attenuated, latter half of 

 the last whorl compressed. Whorls about 8i. Aperture piri- 

 form, the jjeristome thickened, narrowly reflexed. Superior 

 lamella rather small, continuous with the spiral lamella; inferior 

 lamella forming a strong, subhorizoutal fold; subcolumellar 

 lamella emerging. Princii)al plica rather short, lateral; upper 

 and lower palatal plicae of moderate length, oblique, two minute 

 palatal plic;e between them. Length 21i, diara. 6 mm. 

 Yaku-shima (JSTo. 670 of Mr. Hirase's collection). 

 Specimens from Tane-ga-shima, which may be called vai'. cog- 

 nata, are referable to the same species. They are a little larger, 

 reddish-brown, perceptibly thinner than the types though still very 

 strong, and with 9^ whorls (No. 661 of Mr. Hirase's collection). 

 There is also a well-marked variety found on Yaku-shima, much 

 smaller, length 14i to 17 mm., more slender, but the color of the 

 type. This may be called var. nugax. 



These forms closely resemble C. brevior v. ^lart. in the obese 

 contour, very much attenuated above; but they are excessively 

 strong, while brevior is thin. One species of the brevior group 

 occurs in southeastern Kiusiu, C. Addisoni Pils. This was orig- 

 inally described as a variety of C. brevior, but on opening addi- 

 tional specimens I find that there is a more or less distinct, straight 

 lunella between the second and lower palatal plica3, not present in 

 C. brevior. jNIoreover, C. brevior seems to be widely separated 

 geographically from Addiioni. I think therefore that the latter 

 will stand as a distinct species.

PECULIARITIES OF THE TERRESTRIAL LARVA OF THE UEODELOUS 

 BATRACHIAN, PLETHODON CINEREUS Green. 



BY THOMAS H. MONTGOMERY, JR., PH.D. 



To the writer's knowledge no description has been published of 

 the larval stage of this strictly terrestrial species, which occurs 

 through the United States of America east of the Mississippi river. 

 Cope' states: " Its habits are entirely terrestrial, as it is never, 

 even in the larval stage, found in the water. It is abundant under 

 stones and logs in the forests everywhere, and does not occur iu 

 open fields. The eggs are laid in a little package beneath a stone 

 in a damp place. When the young emerge they are provided with 

 branchia3, but these soon vanish, and they are often found in this 

 young stage apparently quite developed." I have collected several 

 hundred individuals near West Chester, Pa., at all seasons of the 

 year, and have never found them in streams or boggy places, but 

 most generally in woods on hillsides at varying elevations above 

 water-courses, sometimes several hundred feet from any water, and 

 occasionally in open fields and hillsides which in the summer season 

 become very dry. F or the most part they are found beneath wood 

 and stones, and even in mid-winter may he found in these places, 

 though at that time generally deeper in the ground than iu summer. 



This being, then, such a strictly terrestrial species, it was to be 

 anticipated that its larval stage would show deviations from the 

 larvfe of the other Urodelea which develop in the water. In July 

 of the present year I found five eggs of Plethodon cinereus under a 

 stone, and curled around them, on guard, an adult which dissection 

 proved to be a female; these ova were larval stages, and the exam- 

 ination of them showed many interesting modifications, as follows: 



The figgs are relatively very large for the size of the species, and 

 ■each enclosed in gelatinous envelopes. Active movements of the 

 heads and tails of the larvre could be observed within the innermost 

 membrane. But the striking peculiarity, even to the naked eye,

 1889. 




504 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [AugUSt, 



is a large, nearly siaherical yolk-mass around which the larva is 

 curled, or rather into which it is pressed by the tension of the 

 egg-envelopes. Plate XXX, fig. 1 shows a larva freed from its 

 envelopes before killing so that it had straightened out; and fig. 2, 

 an older larva, similarly treated, but which had still retained much 

 of its normal position. The surface of the yolk-sphere is well sup- 

 plied with blood-vessels, as shown in fig. 1, an antero-ventral one 

 being particularly prominent. The figures show that there are three 

 pairs of gills present (in fig. 2 only one gill is shown on the right 

 hand, for the sake of clearness) ; and in the older larva the gills 

 are of great size, much branched, the first the smallest, the second 

 largest, lamellar and richly vasculated. The fore and hind limbs 

 are already well marked, the toes on both faintly outlined; but 

 most remarkable is the fact that the posterior limbs are larger 

 than the anterior, which might indicate that the former develop 

 first, in contradiction to what is known of other Urodelea. The 

 head, the limbs, and all the trunk region of the embryos, except 

 the end of the tail, are dorso-ventrally flattened, due undoubtedly 

 to pressure against the yolk-sphere, but become more cylindrical 

 after removal from the egg-euvelopes. The head and trunk are 

 pigmented with dark-brown ehromatophores, which in the trunk 

 region are arranged metamerically, while'' the yolk-sphere is not 

 pigmented and of a yellow color; and as the figures show, the eyes 

 are very large. A mouth was present in',both cases, but there 

 appeared to be no sucking disks upon the lower side of the head. 

 In fig. 3 is shown a camera drawing of a section through a 

 stage somewhat younger than that of fig. 1 ; this section was made 

 through an embryo curled closely around the yolk-sphere, in such 

 a manner that the anterior region of the head, shown on the 

 upper side, is cut medially, while a portion of the bend of the 

 trunk, seen on the right-hand lower side, is cut obliquely. This 

 figure is to illustrate the relations of the intestine to the yolk-mass. 

 The mouth (J/o.) leads through the pharynx (Ph.) and oesoph- 

 agus ( CEs.) to the stomach (SL), and posteriorly to the latter is a 

 short diverticulum (-D.). The small intestine (Int.) is seen to be 

 tubular in its proximal portion, but more distally to pass over 

 into the wall of the yolk-mass {Yk.). The yolk-mass of this 

 stage is seen to be composed of large yolk-cells, the boundaries of 

 which are very distinct. In this fig. 3 the relative dimensions of 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 505 



yolk-mass to the body are not shown, since the head hides a part 

 of the yolk-mass, and since the head is cut obliquely and so 

 appears larger than it would be in strictly median section. 



But the relations of the intestine to the yolk-mass are more 

 clearly shown in the camera drawings 4 and 5, which are dorsal 

 portions of cross-sections of the larva shown in its entirety in 

 fig. 1. Fig. 4 is in a plane behind the gill region, and shows how 

 the intestine (Lit.) is connected with the yolk-sphere {Yk.'). 

 The epithelium of the intestine, the nuclei of which are shown as 

 black spots, expands ventrally into the yolk-sphere on the dorsal 

 aspect of the latter. The epithelium of the intestine ends abruptly 

 against the peripheral layer of the yolk-sphere, and does not pass 

 over into it gradually. The nuclei of the yolk-sphere are much 

 smaller and peripherally placed, and in places are found small 

 clusters of nucleated cells. The yolk-mass of this larva shows 

 that the cell boundaries of the yolk-cells have disappeared, and 

 consequently the latter are undergoing regressive changes; the 

 yolk appears as a mass of globules of different volumes suspended 

 in a structureless fluid and without nuclei. Fig. •') represents the 

 dorsal half of a cross-section through the same larva, in a plane 

 about half-way between the anterior and posterior limbs. In 

 this region there is no tubular intestine, nor any open groove of 

 intestinal epithelium upon the yolk-sphere, the entoderm being 

 represented simply by the yolk-sphere (Yk.), the small nuclei of 

 which are on its periphery. 



These sections make clear the nature of the yolk-mass, and its 

 relation to the intestine. From the mouth to the commencement of 

 the small intestine the alimentary tract is tubular, and has the same 

 appearance in its epithelial lining as in like stages of other Ba- 

 trachia ; the same is true also for the rectal region of the alimen- 

 tary tract, which is likewise tubular. But the middle region of 

 the intestine is composed of the yolk-mass, which in the earlier 

 stage shown in fig. 3 is made up of large yolk-cells, and in the 

 latter stage of figs. 4 and -5 of a mass of yolk-globules with a 

 peripheral layer of small nucleated cells. Accordingly the large 

 yolk-sphere is not a yolk-sac, since it is an integral part of the 

 intestine. 



The larva shown in fig. 1, of which tigs. 4 and 5 represent sec- 

 tions, is in quite an advanced stage. Externally can be seen the 




506 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [AugUSt, 



gilLs and both pairs of limbs. The sections show tliat pronephroi 

 are present in the anterior trunk somites, and metauephroi {M.T., 

 fig. 5) in the posterior somites. There is a cartilaginous brain 

 capsule, cartilaginous vertebral arches (V.C., figs. 4 and .5), and 

 cartilages for the bones of the limbs. The uotochord {N. C. ) is 

 undergoing degeneration; the somatic mesoderm (So.M.) is 

 divided into ils various components — muscle somites, sclerotom, 

 etc. The segmental ducts (.S'.i>. ) extend posteriorly and open 

 into the rectum. The ca3lom ( C ) is large, the median mesenteries 

 well formed (M.), the liver (L.) and hepatic ducts present. The 

 epidermis (Ed.) is thick and glandular on the dorsal side of the 

 body, and the genital ridges (G.R., fig. 5) developed. All these 

 points show an advanced stage of development, which makes it 

 the more remarkable that the middle intestine should be represented 

 by a large yolk-sphere. 



The sides and ventral aspect of the yolk-sphere are covered with 

 a very thin envelope composed of three cell layers closel)^ apposed, 

 the flattened ectoderm (Ect, figs. 4, 5), the somatic mesoderm 

 (iSo.il/. ) and the sphlanchinic mesoderm (Sp.M.). The fact that 

 the body wall is excessively thin upon the ventral side of the yolk- 

 sphere, would show perhaps that this wall had extended around 

 the yolk not until late in the development. The blood-vessels of 

 the yolk-sphere have their position in the mesodermal layers. 



In conclusion, we find the principal modification of these larval 

 stages to consist in the presence of a large yolk-sphere, which is 

 an integral part of the mid-gut, while the anterior and posterior 

 portions of the gut are tubular. Peculiar also is the great size of 

 the posterior limbs and of the gills (fig. 2), and the continuance 

 within the egg-envelopes after a time when in other Urodelea the 

 larva has emerged from them. All these modifications must be 

 referred to the terrestrial life; and the great size and long continu- 

 ance of the yolk-sphere may be accredited the value of a source 

 of nourishment. A life under still dryer surroundings, and 

 longer life within the egg-envelopes necessitating a larger yolk- 

 sphere, might load to the formation of a yolk-sac in the strict 

 sense by the holoblastic cleavage becoming mesoblastic. The case 

 of Plethodon cinereus is but another to show how readilj' develop- 

 mental processes become modified by change of the environment, 

 and how much care must be used in interpreting them in the 

 search for affinities. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 507 



A number of cases are known in the Anura of terrestrial larvae 

 "with a large yolk-sphere, which have been collected together in a 

 contribution by Miss L. V. Sampson," but terrestrial development 

 in the Urodeleu appears to be much less frequent. In the Ccecilian 

 genus, IcJithyophix, the embiyology of which has been carefully 

 studied by the Sarasins,' there is a large yolk-sphere, which at first 

 becomes segmented only peripherally and not until much later 

 through its entire mass, so that here the development is at first me- 

 soblastic much as in a Sauropsidan. That may perhaps be found 

 to be the case in Plethodon also when its early cleavage is studied. 

 In Ichthyophis the intestine lies at first as a straight open groove 

 upon the yolk (cf. the chapter in the Sarasins' monograph, Das 

 Schichal des Dotters^ ; then the yolk bends into a number of 

 lobes, which later become elongated and entirely covered by the 

 body wall. The intestinal groove of Ichthyophis is supposed by 

 these investigators to become a closed tube without growing round 

 the yolk- mass, but they did not have the necessary stages to show 

 the final fate of the yolk. The Sarasins laid particular stress 

 upon the peculiar development of the Cacilia in discussing their 

 relationships, as, e.g., in allying them with Amphiuma, which 

 Hay* has shown to have quite a similar development. But the 

 fact that Amphiiiina, the CiecUla and Plethodon show great simi- 

 larity in their development, might prove rather that the formation 

 of a large yolk-mass with the embryo curled around it may be 

 merely the consequence of terrestrial development, and the simi- 

 larity express rather a case of convergence than of phyletic 

 affinity. The i-elationships of the Amjihibia must be shown from 

 comparative anatomical standpoints, and not from the larval 

 development which obviously may be easily modified by change in 

 environment, as is particularly well shown in the Anura. 

 Brauer, who studied the development of the Csecilian genus 

 .Hypogeophis from the Seychelles, where it lives wholly terrestrial, 

 concludes:' " Wenn auch kein Zweifel dariiber aufkommen kann,

The only other case known to me of a Urodele with terrestrial 

 development (except the European viviparous Salamandra macu- 

 losa) is that of the Californian Autod<ix lugubris, as described by 

 Ritter and Miller." In this species the eggs are laid attached by 

 pedicels to stones on the land, there is a large yolk-sphere, large 

 gills, and apparently quite close similarity to the larval stages of 

 Plethodon.

CYMBULIOPSIS VITREA, A NEW SPECIES OF PTEROPOD. 

 BY HAROLD HEATH AXD M. H. SPAULHIXG. 



On the 27th of December, 1900, a large number of individuals 

 of the species about to be described were taken at or near the sur- 

 face of Monterey Bay, California, and twice since that time great 

 shoals have been noted in the same locality. With the use of 

 formalin, formalin-alcohol and picro-formalin their natural appear- 

 ance and structure have been preserved with exquisite fidelity, and 

 will be more fully discussed in a later paper. 



This species falls naturally into the genus Cymbuliopsis proposed 

 by Pelsencer' which was made to embrace the two species C. ovata 

 and C. cakola, but differs from these in several important respects. 

 The " shell " or casque (Peck),- slightly asymmetrical, possesses 

 the characteristic slipper form and bears on its external surface 

 numerous small rounded tubercles which become smaller and more 

 closely grouped together near the posterior-dorsal surface. Its 

 aperture is large, unarmed and much wider than in C. ovata, hut 

 is almost identical with that of C calceola, and as in the latter, 

 its large cavity extends to the dorsal extremity. The maximum 

 length of the casque is 4 cm., with a width of 2.5 cm. 



The broad, perfectly symmetrical flattened proboscis constituting 

 the head region is in contact with the upper surface of fin, yet 

 free from it to a point immediately in front of the central nervous 

 system. Its edges are grooved and lead into the wide funnel- 

 shaped mouth and wsophagus. Dorsal to the latter and symmet- 

 rically placed are the tentacles having the form of small knob-hke 

 projections, each of which is supplied with a strong nerve from the 

 cerebral ganglia. Peck noted the occasional absence of these

structures in C. calceola, but it was found to be present in each of 

 the fifty specimens of C. vitrea examined on this point. The 

 oesophagus leads directly backward into the visceral mass, where it 

 joins the relatively voluminous stomach provided with five large 

 and several small teeth. The intestine makes one turn on the 

 ventral surface of the stomach and opens into the mantle cavity 

 shghlly to the left of the median line. The remainder of the 

 visceral mass is composed of the large liver and the gonad, which 

 has the form of a thin sheet investing the surface of the visceral 

 mass except at its forward extremity, where the albumen gland 

 and seminal receptacle are situated.

The manlle cavity is placed on the ventral side of Cymbuliopsiii, 

 and anterior to the visceral mass a portion of the bounding epithe- 

 lium is modified into the pallial gland. This is crossed by one 

 complete and two incomplete transparent bands. Peck states that 

 the pallial gland is " almost symmetrical in this genus, being 

 twisted somewhat to the right, but the asymmetry was not marked." 



In C. vitrea the a.«ymmetry is not especially apparent, but it is 

 twisted in the reverse direction to that described and figured bv

Peck, and it also difters in being relatively larger and much nearer 

 the anterior margin of the casque. Beyond the pallial gland the 

 mantle cavity narrows and again enlarges to form the space 

 surrounding the visceral mass, kidney and heart. Peck's figure of 

 C. calceola represents the foot as extending to the anterior border 

 of the casque, while in C. vitrea this organ is relatively much 

 larger and projects beyond the shell almost half its width. Three 

 sets of muscles operate it as in the other species of the genus, and 

 a large number of pigment spots, probably sensory in function, are 

 scattered along its marsiu.

OH THE PROBABLE AGE OF THE ALABAMA WHITE LIMESTONE. 

 BY THOMAS L. CASEY. 



The Jackson stage of tlie marine Eocene may, and probably 

 does, offer several lithological characters in common with the Vicks- 

 burg, but in the nature of its fossils it differs so profoundly that 

 it is impossible to conceive of aught else thau the lapse of a greatly 

 prolonged time interval between the two horizons. Among some 

 240 species of the Jackson group I collected at Moody's 

 Branch and at Montgomery, La., and the bluffs below, I am 

 unable to recognize more than eight or ten which are unmis- 

 takably identical with any of a still larger series which 1 have 

 found in the Vicksburg beds during a residence of nearly two 

 years. It is true that there are quite a number of Vicksburg 

 species so closely related to analogues of the Jacksonian as to con- 

 clusively indicate a direct descent from the latter, but many of 

 these species belong to that class which, from the isolation of their 

 environment, are peculiarly slow in evolutionary chaoges, such, for 

 example, as Dentalium and Cadulus and some of the small 

 Ijivalves, which from their frailness must live very secluded lives. 



The fact which most distinctly proclaims the revolution of 

 environmental conditions that must have been brought about 

 during the interval in question, and the probably great lapse of 

 intervening time, is that so many highly characteristic Eocene 

 forms, such as Venericardia planicosta, Vertlcordia eoceiise, Calyp- 

 traphorus, Pseudoliva, Capulus, Volutilithes, Papillina, Lapparia, 

 and other mollusks, besides a number of very characteristic Tur- 

 binolid corals, completely disappear and leave no descendant in 

 any way related to them, for there are no species occurring in 

 the Vicksburg strata which recall any of these forms. And 

 again, there are many distinct types in the Vicksburgian, such 

 as Tritonopsis and Lyria costata, the ancestry of which cannot 

 be satisfactorily traced from the Jackson, and which must have 

 required a long time for their evolution. In addition to these 

 33 




514 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



facts, there are several broad and striking differences between the 

 two faunas, such, for example, as the great abundance of Bryozoa 

 in the Jackson and the insignificant representation of this great 

 class of animal life in the Vicksburg. 



Because of the existence of most of these Eocene forms in the 

 Red Bluff bed, I am inclined to consider that horizon more 

 closely related to the Jackson than to the Vicksburg, in spite of 

 the greater proportion of its species which have been identified 

 with the Vicksburgian. It is possible, also, that many of these 

 supposedly identical forms may prove to be more or less well 

 marked subspecies, and not exactly the same as their Vicksburgian 

 successors. However, not having visited the Red Bluff^ deposit as 

 yet, it would be unreasonable to pass any definite opinion on this 

 point. 



If my memory serves, Mr. Vaughan informed me some time 

 ago that he had found Alveiinis minutus at Claiborne, Alabama. 

 This species literally swarmed throughout the Jackson stage, and, 

 in fact, is one of the most characteristic upper Eocene species, but 

 no trace of it or of any allied species has occurred in either hori- 

 zon at Vicksburg, even upon diligent special search on the part of 

 the writer and careful washing of considerable quantities of marl 

 from various parts of the beds. The discovery of a species of 

 this genus in the Oligocene of Florida by Dr. Dall is therefore 

 the more surprising. 



As a broad statement, therefore, it may be said that the diver- 

 gence of the Jackson and Vicksburg faunas is so radical as to 

 abundantly justify the assignment of them to diff^ereut epochs of 

 the Tertiary — the Eocene and the Oligocene. 



It is here necessary to discuss the distribution in time of the two 

 species, Orbitoides maulelll and Pecten poulsoni, before alluding 

 to the White Limestone of Alabama, for these two species seem to 

 liavo been regarded, especially by Hilgard, as the conclusive ear- 

 marks of the Vicksburg formation. This is an error which has 

 caused much misapprehension, for there is abundant testimony to 

 prove that they both persist through such an extended range in 

 time as to deprive them of any such value. 



As for Orbitoides mantelH, I personally collected in two partial 

 days at Moody's Branch, and a portion of a day al Montgomery, 

 La., with subsequent washing^ of a little^marl, seventeen speci- 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 515 



niens, some of which represented large and well-developed indi- 

 viduals. This species was therefore at least tolerably abundant 

 throughout the Jackson stage, and was probably iu existence long 

 before. 



At Vicksburg there are two distinct horizons, as recognized by 

 Meyer,' but very inadequately and in part erroneously elucidated 

 by Hilgard. The lower Vicksburgiau consists of alternate thin 

 strata of gray sands, sandy clays and variably, but usuaUy loosely, 

 compacted white or gray limestone. The upper consists of a 

 much thinner bed of more or less red-brown marl, often indurated 

 into nodular masses, or subindurated, and without trace of lime- 

 stone, having rarely, however, thin layers of glauconitic sands 

 and comminuted shells, in which entire specimens when found are 

 generally much distorted by pressure. 



The faunas of these two beds differ very markedly, and there 

 are probably not one-half of the species of either common to the 

 two. One of the chief points of distinction resides in the fact 

 that Orbitoides mantelll is virtually altogether wanting in the 

 lower or limestone bed and is abundant and fully developed in the 

 upper or marl bed. As this species existed in Jacksonian times, 

 however, it seems as though it must certainly occur in the lower 

 Vicksburg limestone, but at any rate it is so rare that I have 

 never observed a specimen. The incongruity, therefore, of call- 

 ing the Vicksburg limestone an Orbitoidal limestone is sufficiently 

 evident; possibly the error occurred by reason of the washing 

 down into the ravines of some material from the upper marls. It 

 is consequently certain, from the facts above mentioned, that 

 Orbitoides mantelli and its varieties existed through a considerable 

 portion of the entire duration of our early middle Tertiary, inclu- 

 ding and subsequent to the Jackson stage, and that it became alter- 

 nately abundant or semi-extinct according as surrounding condi- 

 tions favored or retarded its development. 



In regard to Pecten poulnoni, it is only necessary to refer to the 

 report on the Coastal Plain of Alabama, by Dr. E. A. Smith, where, 

 on page 237, this species will be found listed with the Bashi fossils 

 of the Lignitic stage. As there is no more reason to doubt the 

 correctness of this identification than there is to doubt the identity 



' The two lower horizons of Meyer constitute, in my opinion, but one. 




516 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



of the Vicksburg forms with the species in question, it will be 

 readily perceived that Pedeii poulsoni, because of its extended 

 duration in time, is deprived of any decisive value as a criterion. 

 Besides this, however, I find that there are at Vicksburg two well- 

 defined subspecies, or perhaps closely allied distinct species, one 

 characterizing the lower and the other the upper horizon, which 

 have been indiscriminately alluded to as poulsoni for many years; 

 it is quite possible that neither of them is exactly the same as 

 that species, which was apparently described originally from the 

 White Limestone itself. 



On the Tombigbee river, near St. Stephens, and on the Ala- 

 bama river, near Claiborne, there appear more or less conspicuous 

 bluffs composed of a white limestone, which has been designated 

 the Alabama White Limestone. The lower portion of the blufT at 

 St. Stephens has been considered to be Jacksonian, while the 

 upper part, which is apparently a conformable continuation, 

 although differing noticeably in lithological character, has been 

 identified as Vicksburgian, primarily because the limestone here 

 becomes orbitoidal, and, secondarily, because it also contains a 

 few fossils, especially Peeten j)ouhoni, which bear a strong resem- 

 blance to species occurring at Vicksburg. In accepting this as a 

 fact we are forced to admit that two horizons, differing at least 

 quite as radically in their fauna as any other two consecutive stages 

 of the American Tertiary, are here conformably united in a con- 

 tinuous bluff of limestone. This would seem to be incongruous 

 and highly improbable on general reasoning, but in my opinion it 

 is not a correct statement of the case, and the above discussion of 

 Orbitoides and Peden poulsoni renders it quite unnecessary to form 

 any such conclusion. It seems much more probable that the 

 entire White Limestone of Alabama, including the coral lime- 

 stone, is intermediate in age between the Claiborne and Jackson 

 stages.' I feel the more confident in this statement on again con-

suiting the rejDortof Dr. Smith, where, on page 109, it is said that 

 Venericardia planicosta was found by Mr. Aldrich in the upper 

 part of the limestone near Claiborne, which is presumably the 

 orbitoidal part, and this at once proves that it cannot at least be 

 Vicksburgian. If this is not conclusive, however, it can be sup- 

 plemented by another significant remark, made by Mr. Cunning- 

 ham on page 254 of the same report, to the effect that the orbi- 

 toidal or upper portion of the White Limestone contains large 

 numbers of " minute coralline branches." These are exceedingly 

 abundant iu the fauna of the Moody's Branch beds of the Jack- 

 sonian, and constitute one of its conspicuous features, but Ihey are 

 completely unknown from either the lower or upper horizons of the 

 Vicksburgian. 



It is probable that the uplift of the true Vicksburg beds was 

 very limited in geographical extent, and confined to the vicinily 

 of the capes or elbows of the coast separating, on both sides, the 

 Bay of Mississippi from the ocean to the south, and that the 

 so-called Vicksburg localities in eastern Mississippi are to be viewed 

 with suspicion. It will require something more than Dentalium 

 mississippiense, Peden pou/soni and Orbitoides mantelli to prove 

 them even approximately synchronous, as these classic species are 

 all noticeably extended in vertical range. 



Mr. D. W. Langdon enumerates ' the fossils collected by him at 

 Byram Station, on the Pearl river. They are all Vicksburgian 

 with the exception of C'tpxdus americanu-'!, which is Jacksonian. 

 As this species has never been found at Vicksburg, the presump- 

 tion is that the Byram beds are older than the true Vicksburg- 

 ian, and this is further borne out by the fact, which I have 

 noted from personal observation, that the Byram deposit con- 

 tains, besides the species quoted by Mr. Langdon, a consider- 

 able number peculiar to it and apparently occurring nowhere 

 else. The evidence adduced by Mr. Langdon would seem to 

 show that there is a notable thickness of marine, though 

 scarcely fossiliferous, deposits between the true Jackson and 

 Byram, and it is probable that during this interval the Red Bluff 



tion which must be considered to be undescribed. In the Lower Claiborne 

 at Natchitoches, La., another form of Orbitoides occurs, which is smaller 

 and thicker than that of Jackson and Vicksburg and probably specifically 

 different.

beds were formed. The order of emergence of the various de- 

 posits — which were all more or less local — may therefore be stated 

 to be: (1) Jackson stage, (2) Red Blufif substage, (3) Byram sub- 

 stage, and (4) Vicksburg stage. The Seohinella ecelata men- 

 tioned by Mr. Langdon among the Byram fossils, is not exactly 

 the same as the form described from Vicksburg under that name, 

 but is a very v;ell-marked variety or subspecies, related, in fact, 

 more closely to the form occurring at Red Bluff. The degenera- 

 tive Vicksburg modification, strangely enough, appears to be 

 entirely wanting in the lower — limestone — horizon, but is suffi- 

 ciently common in the upper marls, as in the case of Orhitoides 

 mantelli alluded to above.

FUKTHEE STUDY OF AN ANT. 

 BY ADELE M. FIELDE. 



Argument. — That Stenamma fuivum picemn^ is the bearer of 

 three distinct odors, perceived through the three distal segments of 

 her antennte: («) A scent deposited by her feet, forming an indi- 

 vidual trail, whereby she traces her own steps, discerned through 

 her tenth segment; (6) an inherent and inherited odor, manifested 

 over her whole body, identical in quality for queens and workers 

 of the same lineage, a means for the recognition of blood-relations, 

 discerned by contact of the eleventh segment; (c) a nest-smell, 

 consisting of the commingled odors of all animate members of 

 the colony, diffiised by them in air or ether, constituting an aura 

 whereby they distinguish their nest from those of aliens and 

 discfrned through the twelfth, the distal, segment. 



That her behavior is influenced by a sensory memory; and that 

 while, without experience or instruction, she capably constructs 

 the dwellings of her species and tends the young, her criterion of a 

 nest-aura is established solely by association, and may be changed 

 many times during her life. 



That her care of the young is a reflex from the eighth and ninth 

 segments of her antenna;; and that she receives an immediate 

 reward for her labor in the sustenance thereby obtained. 



That the gregarious habit of the ant is a conjoint result of the 

 reflexes from the five distal segments of her antennje. 



An Oriental folk-story ascribes to the ant a keen sense of 

 smell,' and Occidental biologists grant its possession of this faculty. 



I have recently carried on experiments,' using the maze herein 

 described, whereby 1 believe it to be shown that Stenamma fulimm 

 picetim, aided by a sensory memory, finds her way by means of an 

 individual scent deposited from her feet, and that her perception of 

 this scent is through the tenth segments of her antennas.

[Oct., 



The Maze. 



The floor of the maze was a pane of clear glass laid npon white cardboard, 

 upon which the runs were indicated by letters and figures. The runs were 

 twelve raillimetcrs or a half inch wide, and were separated by walls twelve 

 millimeters high and twelve millimeters thick, built of strips of glass closely 

 joined to one another and to the floor by I.ePagc's liquid glue, and dried 

 during several months before the ma/.e was used in experiment. The walls 

 were topped by a layer of cotton wadding which was removed and renewed 

 whenever the maze was cleaned for a new cxpt-riment. The root, laid upon 

 the wadding and closing the maze at the top, was a square of thin clear 

 glass diagonallj' divided across a~-V\ for convenience in uncovering only 

 half the maze at a time. Eirort was made to secure the same degree of light, 

 warmth and humidity in every part of the maze. 



At / a straight glass tube seven centimeters long commnnicated with a 

 small nest in which the ant household used in the experiment had been 

 long established. The tube /, as well as the nest, was completely darkened, 

 and was opposite the source of light. 



At 7 a glass tube, bent upward at its outer end, gave ingress to the ants 

 from my hand and was stopped by a plug of cotton when not in use. 



The distance from 7' to /was twenty-one centimeters, a little more than 

 eight inches 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 523 



I placed some hundreds of pupae at the T corner, and taking 

 marked and unmarked ants from the nest J, introduced them to 

 the maze through the tube, T. In no case, except when mani- 

 festly lost, did any ant carry^ in a pupa without having first made 

 the journey without a burden. Sometimes an ant traversed more 

 than one run before she began the labor of carrying in, and if she 

 afterward used more than one of the runs she never used other 

 than those she had previously traversed, no matter how many of 

 her fellow burden-bearers were travelling the other routes. If the 

 glass floor was clean she apparently had greater difficult}' in estab- 

 lishing her trail than when the floor was covered by wood or by 

 earth. In the first case, she would go a short distance, as from 

 T to a^ or iv^, and return, and then would prolong her next jour- 

 ney as far as a^ or ?i', and she might make many excursions from 

 T over the same path before she discovered the entrance to the nest 

 at I. When the floor was covered with earth a single trip often 

 sufficed, and she began to carry in when on her second excursion 

 from T. The structure of the ant's feet adapts them to the partial 

 clasping of particles of earth, and it may be that pressure assists 

 in the deposit of the scent. 



Having begun to carry in, an ant usually continued her work 

 incessantly, making from thirty-seven to seventy round journeys in 

 an hour. No burden-bearing ant ever made a loop in her own 

 trail. The shortest run, c-d, was not oftenest taken, but no ant 

 ever carried in by a route longer than a single run, a, m, c-d, 

 11 or h. 



The c-d run virtually counted as but one, for when any ant 

 had made the c or the d passage, she afterward used either side of 

 the central block c with little hesitation. 



There was no evidence that any ant was influenced by the fact 

 that the e-d run was shortest, and that there were certain ad- 

 vantages in following a straight line; but we should not therefore 

 hastily declare that ants have no reasoning power. The Chinese, 

 for reasons well known to themselves, generally make their roads 

 crooked. 



The ingoings and returns of several marked ants during one

 than from light. If the ants huddled upon the pupa;, making their own

hour were recorded. Dot One made seventy-two journeys, going 

 in and returning by the e-d run. Deviations, apparently caused 

 by pressure or by momentum, were sometimes made on departing 

 from T or from I, but she never deviated from her trail more than 

 four times her own length without discovering her error and retrac- 

 ing her path into the c-d run. 



Dot Tivo made sixty-one round journeys by the c-d run. Other 

 ants were at the same time going in and returning by the same and 

 by other routes. 



Dot Three made forty round trips. The first fourteen were all 

 by the n run. She was then carried, apparently by her own 

 momentum under a heavy burden, into the a run, and there 

 wandered to and fro, utterly lost, notwithstanding the frequent 

 passing of her comrades. She eventually made her way by the a 

 run into /. Somewhat later, under similar momentum, she like- 

 wise floundered through c-d, and then at intervals she afterward, 

 with no hesitation, four times took the c-d route to I. All her 

 other ingoings and all her returns were via the n run. A few 

 hours later, when I again set the ants to work. Dot Three again 

 took the n route, and in an hour made forty-eight round trips 

 thereby. A few times she made impetuous starts into other runs, 

 but she every time retraced her steps and followed her best-known 

 path. I thea removed her to a Petri cell, closed the entrances to 

 all runs other than c-d and vi, and put several unmarked ants to 

 the work of carrying in pupw. During that afternoon and the 

 succeeding foretioim, these ants made over three hundred round 

 trips through m and c-d. When these two runs had thus been 

 thoroughly scented by other ants, and while their trails were yet 

 fresh, I unclosed all the runs and put Dot Three in through T. 

 After an absence of nineteen hours, she made ner first trip, with- 

 out a burden, through )*, and then resumed the carrying in of 

 pup;u, making fifty-four round journeys in an hour, going in forty- 

 eight times by the n run and six times by the c-d run, and return- 

 ing fifty-two times by the n run iiud twice by the c-d run. Not 

 once did she enter the m run, which had during the previous hour 

 been traversed hundreds of times by her comrades. 



The following day, no use having been made of the maze in the 

 interval, I again put Dot Three in at T. She at once went, with- 

 out a burden, through a, and returned through n. During the 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 52-^ 



next hour she made forty-six burden-bearing journeys through n, 

 returning forty-five times through n and once through c. She 

 undertook to carry in a larva larger than herself and, after pro- 

 tracted and ineffective effort, dropped it at n*, returned, and then 

 carried in a very small larva. On subsequent journeys she repeat- 

 edly passed over or close beside the dropped larva, but she seemed 

 to be aware that it had proven too heavy for her, and did not 

 renew her attempt to lift it. 



I then, during her absence in the nest, removed the earth over 

 a space of one centimeter from the floor at n', and washed the 

 glass floor and the neighboring walls and roof. On her return she 

 crossed the space unhesitatingly to the pupie pile at T, made two 

 burden-bearing journeys, one via c, one via a, with both returns 

 via n. She then came and examined the cleaned space, burrowed 

 in the bank at its sides, went to and fro several times over it, and 

 resumed her carrying in through this n run. 



Dot Four having first made without a burden excursions 

 through the b, c, n, m and a runs, made fifty-five consecutive 

 burden-bearing journeys, going in forty-five times by the a, twice 

 by the m, four times by the c—d, and four times by the n run. 

 Her returns were forty-nine times by the a, ouce by the m, twice 

 by che c, and three times by the n run. The b run was not again 

 entered. I then isolated her in a Petri cell, and two days later, 

 having stopped the a run with plugs of cotton, I returned her to 

 the maze through T. She at once tried to enter a, pushing at the 

 cotton and endeavoring to creep under or over it. Finding it 

 impassible, she made several journeys through m. I then isolated 

 her two days more, unstopped a, and returned her to the maze 

 through T. She resumed her route through m, and made six 

 round trips by that run which she had used while a was stopped, 

 then she made a return through a, her older path, and from that 

 time all her ingoing journeys and returns were made by that route. 



Dot Five made sixty round trips, of which twenty-eight ingoing 

 journeys were made by the m, thirty-one by the a, and two by the 

 c-d run. Of her returns fifty-two were made by c-d and nine, 

 at intervals, by m. When she had passed thirty-seven times 

 through m, I laid across its floor, at m^, while she was at T, a 

 strip of paper one centimeter wide. As soon as she reached it she 

 turned back with her burden and went in by c-d, returning as 




526 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Oct., 



usual by c-d. Twice more she likewise came to the paper, and 

 although several other ants had meantime passed over it, she 

 retraced her steps into c-d, and thereafter made no more excur- 

 sions into m, going always through c-d. 



Dot Six entered the maze at T, made lier first round trip, with- 

 out a burden, through m, then took a false start into c-d, wan- 

 dered tliere, reached 2, returned to m^ and followed the m run to 

 the nest. Thereafter she made nineteen journeys, going in fifteen 

 times through m and four times through n, and returning once 

 through n, and eighteen times through c-d. I then put a barrier 

 across 3, expecting her to turn back and take the m ox n route, 

 but in returning on her trail she discovered what neither the ants 

 nor I had before observed, a small hole in the glass wall at h, and 

 through this hole she reached n. After that her journeys, made 

 with no hesitation, were as follows: 



After Dot Six had several tens of times passed through the hole 

 in the wall, I stopi>ed the runs from c-d at 3 and at S, enclosing 

 two burden-bearing ants and a dropped pupa. The two ants had 

 trails directly to I, and when they found themselves unable to 

 proceed through 3 they turned back and repeatedly explored all 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 527 



parts of c-d. Il was plain that the trail of Dot Six through the 

 hole gave them no guidance. At last one of the two ants found 

 the hole, passed through it, made her way in, returned and carried 

 in the dropped pupa, passing the hole the second and third times 

 with no hesitancy. The trail of this ant, added to that of Dot Six, 

 apparently gave no clue to the remaining ant, for she continued to 

 hunt for an exit until she, too, finally found the hole for herself, 

 and went through it to I. During succeeding hours, after 2 and S 

 were unstopped, no more than the three ants, including Dot Six, 

 ever used the hole as a passageway. 



While the ants were carrying in pupse, one of the two queens in 

 the nest twice came out to the T corner, examined the pupse pile 

 and went back, but no worker changed her route to follow that of 

 the queen. 



It is evident from the foregoing records, giving examples taken 

 from among many made, that the ant followed her own trail, 

 taking it in either direction with equal facility. She was doubtless 

 influenced in her course by the topography of the ground. Dot 

 Seven always went in through the b run, passing close to the outer 

 wall at b'". On returning she usually mounted a corner of the 

 inner wall near b^ and scrambled down its vertical face. The 

 latter route was feasible for a return journey, but impracticable 

 for her when she carried a burden. 



When the ants regularly took one route for the outgoing and 

 another for the ingoing trip, they appeared to follow the line of 

 least resistance, or to be influenced by convenience. I have repeat- 

 edly seen ants change their customary route when they found their 

 progress hindered by other ants that were taking the same or the 

 opposite course. When ants journey in numbers they go by one 

 route and return by another, as human throngs divide, for mutual 

 advantage, into two processions for crossing a bridge, one moving 

 to the right, the other to the left. 



The ants cannot follow the trail of a foe. An intruder whose 

 aura has alarmed the colony may pass close to a resident, alert on 

 the warpath, and the resident will run to and fro with no clue 

 to the exact location of the enemy until the touch of an antenna 

 reveals it. 



Bethe holds that there is a polarization of the scent,' showing 



' Albrecht Bethe, Dilrfenwir den Aineisen und Bienenpliyschisehe Quali- 

 taten zuschreiben. Pfliiger's Archiv, Vol. 70, Jan.. 1898. 




528 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



the ant the directioa loward or away from the nest. He caused 

 ants to make a path across a board, a section of which could be 

 made to revolve 180°. When the section was reversed, an ant 

 reaching the section from either direction was unable to directly 

 proceed. If the section was not reversed until the ant was upou 

 it, the ant would continue its way across the section, but on 

 coming to the end of the section would stop and give evidence of 

 having lost its trail. 



Perhaps by reversing the section the continuity of the indi- 

 vidual trail was broken, the ant being therefore unable to directly 

 proceed. My experiments show that the theory of polarization of 

 the scent is untenable. Dot Five, after establishing her trail, 

 made, in thirty minutes, twenty-eight round trips through a. 

 During her absence in the nest, at the end of every ingoing journey, 

 I changed the relative position of at least three centimeters of 

 earth forming her path, and I gradually extended the displace- 

 ments as far as from a' to a% being careful to make the road 

 level and quiet before her return. Not once did she hesitate or 

 wander during all these journeys, allliough in the twenty-eight 

 stirrings every millimeter of her trail had been displaced. Other 

 ants were equally able to follow their trail over displaced portions 

 of their path. 



I also caused many marked ants to make trails over strips of 

 wood covering the floor of the runs, and after the trails were 

 established I turned the strips end for end, being careful to 

 replace them so exactly that the continuity of the individual trail 

 should not be broken. In no case did an ant give sign of having 

 lost her trail. The advance of the ant over the reversed trail was 

 unhesitating even when the reversed strip was so much as eight 

 centimeters in length. 



A layer of washed earth* a millimeter or two in depth may be 

 sprinkled upon the trail without destroying it, as does a thicker 

 layer. The thin layer is doubtless pervious to the scent. The 

 trail may also be moistened for a distance of several centimeters 

 without destroying its continuity. Bui, as Bethe has pointed out, 

 the ant can be thrown off its trail by wiping the floor on which the 

 scent is laid, or by covering it with a strip of wood or of paper 



'Earth taken from any Stenamma falvum piceum nest, well washed in 

 running water and then dried.

from five to teu millimeters wide. The action of the ant when 

 the scent is obscured proves that her trail is individual, and that 

 it is under foot. She does not more readily pass the point of 

 obscuration on account of it having been previously traversed by 

 her comrades. Her action is the same whether she be the first to 

 arrive at the newly-laid flooring or whether many ants have crossed 

 it before her. 



The power of perceiving the individual trail lies in the tenth 

 segments of the antennos. When 

 deprived of this segment the ant 

 is no longer able to find her way 

 in with the pupie, but wanders 

 about helpless and bewildered. 

 Ants deprived of nearly all of 

 the eleventh and all of the 

 twelfth segments continued to 

 carry the pupte through the runs 

 of the maze, though with dimin- 

 ished physical vigor. The ant 

 could pick up her scent so long 

 as a tenth segment was intact, 

 and no longer. For experiments 

 in following the trail, I selected 

 ants that had been previously 

 distinguished by diligence in the 

 carrying in of pupte and later on 

 set them to work with clipped 

 antennje.' 



That memory plays a imrt in 

 the journeys as well as in other 

 pi'oceedings of the ar.t, is shown 

 by experiments made by me iu 

 gradually increasing the width of 



' For removing the whole or any part of the antennaj of the ants used in 

 the experiments described in this paper, the antennae were clipped with 

 sharp scissors, (he wound was merged for five seconds in eighty percent, 

 alcohol to coagulate the blood ; the ant was isolated upon a wet sponge in a 

 Petri cell, without food, for a day, and was thereafter daily placed upon some 

 acceptable food, such as moistened sponge cake, soft pie crust, or bread 

 touched with honey. No insect food was given, and the cell was kept very 

 clean. After fifteen days or longer about forty per cent, of the ants recov-

strips of paper or of wood-shavings laid over the trail. When the 

 ant had well established her trail across the jDaper or shaving I could 

 sometimes in her absence change it, replacing it exactly by a new 

 one of the same color and material, and I have gradually increased 

 its width from five millimeters to fifteen, or from one to three times 

 her lenglh, without causing the slightest distraction of the ant from 

 her steady journeys to and fro over it." This proves that the ant 

 does not smell her way at every point, and that familiarity with 

 certain objects under her feet is gradually acquired. A dissimilar 

 object, or an old object in a difl'erent place, never failed to distract 

 the ant. The frequent placing of new objects upon her path, or 

 repeated interruptions of her work, always caused her to change 

 her route or to abandon her work. 



Many ants, where records were kept, gained speed in the carry- 

 ing in of puptB, the number of journeys accomplished during an 

 hour increasing always with experience of the runs, unless special 

 hindrances occurred. If there be no greater stimulus iu the greater 

 amount of scent laid down, the gain in speed must arise from 

 added familiarit;y with the road. 



I occasioned one of my colonies to move from a Lubbock nest to 

 its annex over a bridge eight inches long, once or twice a "day 

 during ten days, and the colony gradually reduced the time 

 required for a complete change of looa'iou from over an hour to 

 twenty minutes. 



When an ant discovers a barrier across one of the runs in the 

 maze, she does not more than two or three times follow her trail 

 to the barrier, but altogether changes her route. In the change 

 she does not merely cut oflf the loop in her own path, but she 

 frequently takes a diflferent direction. 



ereii from shock-effect and bj' their activities indicated their readiness for use 

 in experiment. Before their recovery the ants were listless and ahiiormallv 

 irritable ; and they attacked with self-destructive violence any moving thing 

 that touched them. One antenna performs all the functions of a pair. In 

 examining hundreds of ants. 1 found many with a single antenna, or with 

 one antenna and the long pro.ximal joint of the other, and these ants, in- 

 cluding queens so maimed, were living normal lives. But I never found in 

 its native nest any antennaless ant. The sense of t;iste is not lost with the 

 antenna;. Ants kept without food for three days lapped hoiieyed cake with 

 evident relish immediately after they were deprived of their antenna;. 

 Their sensitivity to light, heat and humidity also remains unimpaired. No 

 part of an antenna that had been clipped was regenerated during three sab- 

 sequent months that I kept the clipped ants under my observation. 



' My best results were in using moistened brown blotting paper, care being 

 taken that its edges across the path should be exactly even with the surface 

 of the earth covering the floor. 




1901.] NATITRAIi SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 531 



The aptness of these ants to seek a new domicile whenever their 

 nest is disturbed is perhaps correlated with the necessity of main- 

 taining associations which give efficiency to a sensory memory. 



Three worker-ants, without kindred, have lived in one of my 

 Petri cells more than a year. They are perfectly at home in any 

 new similar cell to which I transfer them. This surely indicates 

 that they have become acquainted with their environment through 

 other senses than that of smell. 



Beside the scent whereby the ant lays her individual trail, every 

 Stenamma fulvum piceum has an odor manifest in all jyarts of her ani- 

 mate body, and discerned by herself and by other ants through the 

 eleventh segments of the antennce. 



It is improbable that the environment of the ants impart to 

 ihem their odor. I found beside an old stone fence a colony rear- 

 ing young under loose stones fifty yards apart. Workers taken 

 from the discov^ed extremes of this colonial manor affiliated per- 

 fectly. From a space no larger than a quart-pot I took thirteen 

 deixlated queens in September, and eleven more the following June. 

 Queens and workers of this colony met one another amicably after 

 a full year of separation, although the one had spent that time in 

 native soil, while the other had endured vicissitudes of travel, 

 living in a glass house, feeding on human confections, and drink- 

 ing water containing unlike mineral ingredients. I am also 

 acquainted with two colonies whose swarming exits are but two 

 yards apart, and these two colonies evince the intensest hostility to 

 one another. 



From among more than a hundred experiments that I have 

 made, all yielding corroborative results in a study of the ant-odor, 

 I give but a few examples: 



The ant has an inherent odor. A callow five days old, that 

 had been isolated nine days before emergence from the pupa-stage, 

 was attacked and killed by the first ant it ever met, a callow of 

 another colony. 



Ants reared all the way from the larval stage without ant- 

 nurses attract or repel other ants. 



Ants were reared without ant-nurses, in sequestered groups, 

 from pupse of the same colony. When these ants were twenty days 

 old the groups were united, and the ants at once affiliated. 



Young ants, reared in an alien group, were returned to their 




532 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



blood-relations. They were repeatedly dragged away from the 

 nursery and were kept on probation until their personal odor was 

 ascertained, and were within a day received into full association 

 with their kindred. 



A queen of colony D with four workers that she had reared 

 from larvfe of the C colony, together reared three callows from 

 pupfe of the E colony. When the callows were twenty days old, 

 I put them in a Petri cell with adults of the E colony. The 

 callows attacked the adults as with intent to kill, but they met 

 with great toleration, and within a day all the inmates of the cell 

 were living together in unity. In every case where callows were 

 returned from among aliens to their own stock, the action of the 

 adults bore a strange similitude to patient and forbearing discipline 

 directed toward the reclamation of wayward offspring. 



In a nest containing a queen and workers of colony C, I put a 

 few young ants that had been reared in another section of the 

 C colony from pupa3 of the E colony. The young ants showed no 

 fear of their new host, and were received with but slight sign of 

 suspicion. They were treated as are alien ants smeared with the 

 juices of kindred.' But the superficial gloss did not long deceive, 

 and at the end of the second day the young ants had aU been killed 

 and dismembered. Incorporation into one section of a colony 

 never gave permanent safety in another section of the same 

 ■colony that I had divided. 



Workers of colony D alone reared four callows from pupae of 

 colonv C. I segregated these callows and introduced to their cell 

 four adults from another section of colony C. The adults imme- 

 diately attacked the callows, indicating that they were overlaid 

 with the odor of the workers that had fostered them; but the 

 inherent odor of the callows was also influential, for none were 

 killed, and the next day all the eight ants were clustered serenely 

 in one group. 



The odor is inherited through the queen. Five queens of the C 

 colony, each sequestered with a few of her workers, reared from 

 her own eggs several young ants. I am uncertain whether the 

 five kings associated with these queens were of ditiercut colonies. 

 The issue of any one queen would live in amity with the issue of 



• " A Study of an Ant," A. M. Pielde, Proceedings of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, September, 1901. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 535 



any other one of these queens, and all of the young ants would 

 congregate around any one of the sister-queens. 



Queens of the same colony have the same odor. Two queens, 

 each having a similar mixed family made up of her own and a 

 different stock, were interchanged with no disturbance of the 

 domestic life in either nest. 



Isolated queens of colony D reared each a few workers from 

 pupffi of the C colony. The workers so reared would live amica- 

 bly with any sister of the queen that reared them and also with 

 one another. 



A colony C queen and her issue reared two ants from pupae of 

 the E colony. When the two ants were a month old they were 

 removed from the fostering family and were introduced into a cell 

 containing a queen and adult workers of the C colony all deprived 

 of the smell-sense. The young ants at once snuggled the queen 

 and affiliated with the adults. They manifestly found in this 

 sister-queen and her workers the exact odor to which they were 

 accustomed. 



I took two queens of the C colony and segregated each with 

 pupse of the E colony. After the pupise had become ants fifteen 

 days old, an exchange of queens caused no demonstration of sur- 

 prise or of hostility. 



The inherent odor of the queens and that of the ivorJcers in the 

 same colony is of like qnalify, though the odor of a queen is prob- 

 ably stronger than that of a worker. 



The behavior of kings in the nests proves them to be unable to 

 distinguish between queens and large workers. 



Workers removed from the C colony and segregated when eight 

 days old received amicably, after nine months of separation, the 

 two sister-queens in whose nests they had spent the first few days 

 of active life. Unless their own odor was similar to that of these 

 queens they must have had a personal memory of them. These 

 workers rejected queens of another colony. 



I isolated queens of the C colony and caused each to rear four 

 callows from pupre of the E colony. When the callows were six- 

 teen days old I introduced into every queen's cell two colony C 

 adults deprived of smell-sense. These adults were all received 

 amiably by the callows, indicating that they had the same sort- of 

 odor as had the queen. 




534 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Ants hatched and reared to the age of twenty days with uo 

 association with any other aut received and affiliated with a queen 

 of their lineage, though with some tentative nabbing. 



Into a cell containing eight workers, of which equal numbers 

 had been together reared from pupa3 of two colonies, C and E, I 

 introduced a C colony queen deprived of smell-sense. She was 

 dragged away from the larvfe pile, but was not injured, and in six 

 hours she was a fully accepted member of Ihe mixed group. 



Probably the odor discerned by the ants is something different 

 from any discovered by human nostrils. 



The odor preferred by the individual ant is determined by associa- 

 tion, naturally during the first few days of its active life. Cal- 

 lows no more than three days old, having spent these days with a 

 queen alone, with workers alone, or with both queen and workers, 

 will thereafter withdraw from or fight any queen or worker belong- 

 ing to any colony other than their own ancestral one, or those 

 represented in their earliest nurses. 



Pupse of the E colony were isolated the last thirteen days of 

 their pupa-stage, and their first meeting with any ant was when 

 they were two days old, and was with a queen of the C colony. 

 Within an hour the queen and the callows had perfe;ctly affiliated. 

 This (jueeu had not been deprived of smell-sense; but during the 

 long isolation of the pupae, the E colony odor that earlier overlaid 

 them had doubtless been dissipated, and they therefore presented 

 to her nothing stronger than their own inherent odor as callows. 

 Young callows from pupas that have been isolated during the 

 whole or nearly the whole pupa-period are safe in auy colony. The 

 immediate affiliation of these callows with an alien queen is the 

 point to be here observed. 



I sequestered pupte from colony C and isolated the emerging 

 unlicked callows. When these unnursed callows were two days 

 old I put them into a Petri cell with a colony E queen and workers 

 deprived of the smell-sense. The callows made no attack on the 

 alien adults, but congregated beside the queen or workers as ami- 

 cably as if all were of their own lineage. But callows likewise 

 sequestered, isolated and reared to five days old with no association 

 with other ants, could not be induced to affiliate with aliens. They 

 established for themselves a criterion of correct odor, and withdrew 

 from or seized any ant varying from their standard. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. .535 



Queens and workers will usually live peaceably with any ant 

 that they have reared from the pupa, and they may be caused to 

 rear successive broods of unlike lineage, or to rear at one time a 

 brood from eggs, larvse or pupse of diverse stock. But both queens 

 and workers appear to be less at ease and to filiate less closely 

 with such associates than with those of their own line, unless they 

 greatly outnumber the introduced members of their group. If 

 pupse of alien stock are given to them in large numbers, shortly 

 before the pupte become callows, many of the callows are immedi- 

 ately killed. I segregated three groups, each consisting of a colony 

 € queen and seven adult workers, and gave to each group eight 

 pup£e from colony E. In two of these groups the pupse all became 

 callows ■within four days and all were killed. In the third group 

 the pupre were younger, none became active before the seventh day 

 after being introduced, and five were permitted to live. These 

 five callows had doubtless, during their longer residence in the 

 group fostering them, been overlaid with the odor of the C colony, 

 and therefore when they became active they bore an odor inoffen- 

 sive to their adult companions. They were doubtless smeared 

 with the odor of their hosts. 



I have repeatedly seen a queen, with numerous workers of alien 

 stock, flee from the group of ants that I had induced her to rear 

 in her own nest. She had been unable to lick so many pupse into 

 her own likeness. 



Ants remember, or are for some time positively chemotropic to, 

 the odor to which they were earliest accustomed. An isolated queen 

 of the D colony first reared four workers from larvse of the C 

 colony, and later on this mixed group reared three callows from 

 pupse of the E colony. When these callows were fifteen days old 

 I removed them to the E colony, where they were happily domes- 

 ticated five days. I then sequestered them in a Petri cell, and 

 found that they instantly afliliated with either the D colony queen 

 or the C colony workers that had earliest fostered them. They also 

 affiliated with C colony adults deprived of the smell-sense. 



Two queens of the C colony separately reared eight callows from 

 pupse of the E colony. When the callows were from eight to fifteen 

 days old, I put the two queens into one Petri cell and the eight 

 callows into another, and kept the C and E ants thus apart, for 

 thirty days. I then reunited the queens and the young ants and 

 they again filiated, with no sign of distrust or aversion. 




536 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



An artificially mixed group, now in my possession, was created 

 partially by design and partially by incident, and it curiously 

 illustrates my theme. As mentioned b)- Dr. W. !M. Wheeler,'" 

 Stenamma fulvum p'weum sometimes feed their larvte upon pieces of 

 the pupre of Cremastogasler lineolata. Desiring to know whether 

 these ants would, when without larvte, themselves devour the 

 Cremastogaster pupre, I gave a goodly number of such pupae to 

 each of several groups of Stenammas living in Petri cells. In 

 every group of Stenammas some portion of the Creraa.stogaster pupte 

 was adopted and taken care of, at least during several days. In 

 one group only, three of the Cremastogasters were brought to the 

 active stage, and continued to live with the Stenammas and to share 

 their labor of rearing a single introduced male pupa. Probably 

 these three Cremastogaster pupse were so long in the care of the 

 Stenammas that they were overlaid or smeared with the Stenamma 

 odor before they became animate, and that their inherent odor was 

 therefore obscured. Their own standard of congenial odor would, 

 by earliest impression, be that of the Stenamma group. These 

 Stenammas, which were of the C colony, had previously reared 

 four workers from pupre of the E colony, and I had removed these 

 workers from their cell before the Cremastogaster pupse therein hnd 

 become active. The four workers had meantime been segregated 

 in another cell. When the Cremastogasters were about twelve 

 days old, I returned the E Stenammas, after an absence of twenty 

 days, to the C Stenamma cell. They were cordially received by, 

 and at once filiated with, their foster C queen and workers, and 

 they made no attack on the previously unknown Cremastogasters. 

 But the little Cremastogasters attacked them frequently, until, in the 

 course of a day or two, experience had shown them the futility of 

 attempts on the life of newcomers so much stronger than them- 

 selves. Cremastogaster lineolata introduced from outside were killed 

 under attacks from all the ants in thi.s mixed group. 



That there is, a relatioymhip between the inherent odor of the an^ 

 and itt color, which gradually deepens with age, and that the odor 

 of the queen is stronger than is that of her workers, is sliown by 

 the following experiment. I brought a colony from the woods, 

 placed it in its native earth upon a Lubbock nest, and sequestered 



•o" Habits of Ponera and Stigmatomma,'" Biological Bulletin, Vol. 2, 

 No. 2. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 5.37 



many of its pupse. I then segregated all callows that appeared 

 on tlie same day among the pupte, and in my experiment used 

 none that had been nursed bv any ant during the last three days 

 of the pupa-stage, or that had ever met any ant other than those of 

 her own age and lineage. When the callows were from sixteen 

 to twenty days old, I introduced into a Petri cell containing several 

 of the segregated callows single ants from among their blood- 

 relations in the Lubbock nest. Ants of about their own age were 

 always received with little attention and no nabbing ; older workers 

 with considerable attention and occasional nabbing; and very old 

 workers or queens were attacked and pulled about by as many as 

 three or four callows at once. The amount of excitement produced 

 by the newcomer, and the number of attacks made upon her 

 person, bore a direct ratio to the depth of her color. When an 

 old worker had first been introduced and domiciled, the introduc- 

 tion of a second adult caused little excitement; but that of a queen 

 called forth all the usual demonstrations of interest or distrust. 

 If a queeu was first introduced and domesticated, then the intro- 

 duction of an old worker was an unimportant event. A second 

 queen or a second adult was always received with lesser attention. 

 I therefore think that the ants discriminate not only in regard to 

 the quality of the odor presented, but also as to its intensity, and 

 that the queen presents the ancestral odor in a more concentrated 

 form than do her workers. None of these introduced ants 

 attacked the callows, and all callows affiliated with the introduced 

 ants within a day ; but the fighting instinct of the callow is evi- 

 dently aroused, not only by ant-odors to which it is unaccustomed, 

 but by an intenser expression of its own inherent odor. If the 

 older ants bore an adventitious odor through association with aliens 

 reared in their nest, then the young ants would have borne the 

 same odor and would have ofiered the same reason for attack. 



With the purpose of ascertaining whether the odor of the ant 

 was perceptible to other ants when de})osited upon inanimate objects, 

 I took a new unused maze and smeared the floor and walls of the 

 a and the n runs with the juices of kindred queens and workers, 

 and the m and b runs with the juices of aliens, leaving the c and 

 d runs unsmeared. This smearing did not manifestly influence the 

 ants in their choice of a route in carrying pupje from T to I. 



I then laid upon the floor of the a and n runs earth newly 




538 PROCEEDINaS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Oct., 



taken from their own E nest, and upon the m and b runs earth 

 newly taken from the nest of aliens, making the earth from the 

 two nests to meet in the middle of the passages, 1, 2, S, 4 Into 

 c-d I put washed earth. Immediately after such distribution of 

 the earth I put many ants from the E nest into the maze at T 

 upon the pupse pile, and recorded the number of journeys made 

 through each run. Fully half the journeys were made upon the 

 earth from the alien nest. 



I then closed the a and the ?! runs and sent many ants of colony 

 C over the m and h runs. While the trails were yet fresh, I 

 removed the C ants and their nest, and gave the maze over to the 

 E colony. The E ants in no wise avoided the vi and b ruus that 

 had just been used by the C ants, but they traversed them as often 

 as they traversed the runs through which no aliens had passed. 

 Variations and repetitions of this experiment gave results always 

 similar. I therefore think that the odor of the ant is discernible 

 to other ants only when it is either perceived upon or is immedi- 

 ately disseminated from the living body of the ant. This view is 

 sustained by the fact that alien pupaj placed in the nest just before 

 they emerge from the pupa-stage are at first accepted by the ants, 

 and are nevertheless often killed as soon as they cease to be inert. 



I have found that the ant's power of perceiving this odor lies 

 in the eleventh segments of her antennre. The contact of these 

 segments with any part of the body of another ant is followed 

 by reflexes denoting either satisfaction or repugnance. When the 

 ant is deprived of these segments by a cut across the tenth seg- 

 ment, she no longer discriminates between friend and foe. De- 

 prived of these segments, marked ants of two or of five colonies 

 lived peaceably together or fought one another with absolute 

 impartiality. Forel discovered that ants of alien colonies ceased 

 from hostile demonst;ration when deprived of the antennie; but in 

 my experiments this effect is as complete when no more than the 

 two distal segments are removed. The removal of the twelfth 

 segment alone is not eflective, and as the segments telescope each 

 into its proximal neighbor, the destruction of the tenth is necessary 

 for^the complete removal of the eleventh. 



A healthy ant, with or without antenna;, will fight a dead ant, 

 kindred Jor alien, if the dead ant be made to simulate an attack 

 upon the live ant; and an ant will sometimes continue a battle 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 539 



when all of its body except the head and one pair of legs has 

 been clipped off. I have seen an ant, deprived of the smell-sense, 

 continue through eighteen hours its grip upon an adversary's 

 antenna. An anteunaless ant will fight with energy and endur- 

 ance, the difference between its battles and those of a whole ant 

 being in that it fights indiscriminately the ants of its own and 

 other colonies. In the complete ant the odor appears to modify, 

 control or determine the fighting reflex. 



In all cases of transfer from one kindred group to another there 

 are evidences that the whole ants discern differences in the indi- 

 viduality of their companions whether queens or workers. Every 

 newcomer is examined, sometimes from end to end, by touches of 

 the anteunse; there is often much hesitating and tentative nabbing 

 of an ant that is ultimately received into full fellowship, and two 

 or three impetuous onsets often precede complete filiation. 



In determining through their actions the affinities and repulsions 

 of the ants, I have considered final relationships more important 

 than first behavior. 



The removal of the antennte does not destroy the odor of the 

 auts so maimed, for neither their enemies nor their kindred 

 change on this account their usual behavior toward them. But 

 the excision of these prominent organs reduces greatly their 

 liability to seizure. 



The commingled odors of all the ants in the nest conditutes what 

 Bethe calls the Neststoff, or ivhat I shall call the aura of the iiest. 

 It is diffu-sed in air or ether from the animate occupants of the nest, 

 and it is discerned by the ant through the twelfth, the distal, segments 

 of her antennae. 



By this aura every ant recognizes its own abode and distinguishes 

 it from the abode of other colonies. The aura of the nest may be 

 superadded to, but does not extirpate, the individual scent nor the 

 inherent body odor. 



The creation of a new nest-aura is always possible through the 

 gradual admixture of different odors produced by and disseminated 

 from living ants reared from eggs, larvae or pupae of alien colonies. 



Any ant bearing the preponderating odor is apt to gain easy 

 admission to the nest. The countless variations observed in the 

 treatment of newcomers are due to the infinitely variable propor- 

 tions in the odors borne by the auts. If an ant permanently bears 




540 PEOCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF fOct., 



an odor which is a componeut of the aura, she may be eventually 

 accepted as an associate. If, in a group of ants reared in equal 

 numbers from the pupse of two colonies, C and E, I introduce an 

 ant, deprived of smell-sense, from either the C or the E colony, 

 the fearless newcomer is received with excitement and alarm and 

 may be attacked with violence. But the attack is never fatal, 

 and the blood -relative of half the group is eventually permitted to 

 remain peacefully in the nest. When a whole ant from either C 

 or E colony is introduced, the newcomer manifestly discerns an 

 unfamiliar aura and either flees or else fights to a fatal end. 



The sensitivity of the normal ant to the aura of an alien nest 

 causes her to flee from it when escape is possible, and to endeavor to 

 hide herself when she cannot escape. I have deprived many ants 

 of the distal segments of the antennas, and have found that on 

 complete recovery from shock-eflect their behavior was to be dis- 

 tinguished from that of normal ants by the absence of an exhibition 

 of alarm when introduced into the nest of aliens. Such maimed 

 ants do not flee, nor do they endeavor to hide, nor do they hesitate 

 in close approach to a dense swarm of aliens. Their conduct when 

 introduced into the nests of other colonies is strikingly ditferent 

 from that of the whole ant. Their action, whether in their own or 

 an alien nest, evinces unconsciousness of the aura that determines 

 the advance or retreat of the whole ant, or causes it, with uplifted 

 and waving antennae, to pursue an object that is beyond its reach. 

 Callows reared from the third day of the pupa-stage with no asso- 

 ciation with other ants until the tenth day of active life, had then 

 established their own aura, without the presence of a queen, and 

 manifested alarm at the introduction of aliens. 



If the sublile aura of the nest, imperceptible as it is to human 

 nostrils, is diffused by a vibration in the body of the living ant 

 which it envelops, the aura should be strongest where the greatest 

 number of ants have longest lived. Its allurement in the air 

 or ether may be what sometimes causes an ant to return to an old 

 and empty habitation, and to carry back pupa) that have already 

 been transported to a newly occupied nest. 



The excitement occasioned by the intrusion of an alien among 

 ants that are a few millimeters from the point at which the alien 

 passes, indicates that the aura borne by the introduced ant extends 

 ai least a few millimeters from its l)odv. Tlie behavior of the 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. .541 



resident ants shows that the aura pervades the air or the ether, and 

 gives intimation of the presence of the intruder without denoting 

 her exact location. 



The aura of an ant of the same colony appears often to deter- 

 mine the route of a companion not within touch of the antennw, 

 when burdens are being carried into the nest. 



The distance to which the nest-aura is diffused may depend upon 

 the number and quality of the Hving inmates. 



Before an ant is five days old it has all its reflexes established, and 

 appears to have sprung as from the head of Jove, full grown and 

 completely accoutred, into active existence. 



Callows that became such in the T corner of the maze straightway 

 found a way into the nest, and commenced the carrying in of the 

 inert young. ' 



Callows less than five days old, that had never seen a queen, 

 nor adults, nor earth, were transferred from their Petri cell to a 

 handful of iheir ancestral soil, and they immediately built a nest 

 with runs and recesses such as are made by experienced workers of 

 their kind. 



Prolonged captivity in a glass house does not diminish their 

 ability to use earth in nest-making. I transferred to the earth 

 on a Lubbock nest, when they were nine months old, some queen- 

 less ants that had always lived without earth in one of my artificial 

 nests, and gave them a few larvre and pupa;. Within ten hours 

 the}' had made as perfect runs and recesses as any ever constructed 

 by their species, and had disposed the young in the same manner 

 as do their free congeners. 



Tlie unremitting attention habitually given by the workers to 

 the young is hardly demanded by the necessities of the latter. I 

 segregated eggs, larvse and pupa;, and found that eggs untouched 

 during several days bring forth normal larva;; that with no atten- 

 tion from the ants the full-grown larva may successfully become a 

 pupa; and that the whole pupa-stage may be safely passed with 

 no more tending than such occasional changes of jrosition as will 

 prevent the growth of mould. Penicillium erustaceum" grows to 

 ripeness, in either darkness or light, upon eggs, larvse or pupse, if 

 left for a few days unattended in the humid atmosphere required by 



^' The moulds here mentioned were identified for me by Dr. George T. 

 Moore, of Dartmouth College. 




542 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Oct., 



the ants, aud its sprouting spores may be seen on their surfaces 

 under a magnificatiou of about five hundred diameters. If the 

 spores are left undisturbed they cover the young with a delicate 

 dense white coat that becomes sage-green with the ripening of the 

 new spores. It appears probable that the ants find nutriment in 

 the new mycelium of the mould, from which they relieve the young 

 b}' licking them frequently and thoroughly. If the surfaces of 

 the ant-children be a kitchen-garden spontaneously supplying the 

 nurses with aliment, then these ants enjoy an economic indepen- 

 dence surpassed only iiy that of an ideal creature that could lay 

 eggs sufficient for its own nourishment. 



This delicate mould does not grow upon the bodies of dead 

 ants, but is there replaced by Rhjzopus nigricans, with long aud 

 spreading hyphte, aud in this may lie the cause for the carrying oflf 

 and casting away of all ants that die or are killed in the nest. 



So long as the eighth and ninth segments of the antennas are unin- 

 jured, the ant may continue to lift and care for the eggs, larvce or 

 pupae, but after the removal of these segments she loses all interest in 

 the immg and performs no further ivork in the nursery. I proved 

 this to be true in several colonies. In ray colony B, which had 

 been queenless during many months, the workers had been singu- 

 larly devoted to the larvre and pupre from their own eggs," and from 

 among these ants I selected several that never failed to lift a larva 

 when the cover of their Petri cell was taken away. Some of these 

 assiduous nurses took all usual precaution for the safety of their 

 }'oung so long as the eighth segments of the antenu:e were uuin- 

 jured, but none lacking the eighth segment ever gave heed to 

 nursery duties of any sort. From none of the other ants could I 

 secure any attention to the youug after the excision of the ninth 

 segment. 



Marked ants of two hostile colonies, when clipped across the 

 tenth segment, associated freely and amiably with one another 

 during several days in the care of pupae belonging to one of the 

 two colonies. A whole queen resident in the small nest appeared 

 unable to tolerate the alien odor among the nurses, aud often with- 

 drew from the ever-alluring pupaj pile where they congregated. 

 When the callows appeared, the queen aggressively took her place 



" One of these worker's-egg-larvse, separately reiired, was one hundred 

 and forty days in the larval stage. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 543 



among the young, and drove the alien nurses out from the nursery 

 to the food-room, where they remained until I removed them. 

 The queen's clipped workers continued to tend the young in the 

 manner of whole ants. 



On clipping the anteonte to the seventh segment, the middle of 

 the segmented portion below the elbow, the ants lose all com- 

 munity of interest. In one of my large nests," used as a hotel 

 des invalides, the ants never congregate, but stand separately and 

 sometimes almost equidistant throughout the three rooms. The 

 gregarious habit is probably a conjoint result of tlie reflexes from 

 the five distal segments. 



The instinct of following or huddling, common in young ani- 

 mals, is manifest in this ant during the first hours of its activities, 

 when it keeps close to any accessible queen or worker. 



The huddling instinct is apparently strong in its relation to ants 

 of the same or lesser age. I isolated pupse during the whole pupa- 

 stage, thus freeing them, in their casting off of both the larval 

 and the pupal integument, from all except the inherent odor, and 

 I found that the callows huddled as soon as they were able to walk 

 toward one another. The isolation of such callows for twelve 

 days or longer did not diminish their tendency to huddle with ants 

 of their own age or with younger ones of the same lineage. ]5ut 

 from the twelfth to the twentieth day of isolation there was a 

 marked diminution of the disposition to follow the queen and to 

 huddle with adults. Dr. Edward Thorndike says" that " if 

 chicks do not have a chance to follow a hen in the first ten or 

 twelve days they will not go near one if they have a chance." I 

 have found no limit to the age at which a worker will follow a 

 queen, but the attraction exercised by the queen is apparently due 

 solely to association. When she or her kind has not been known 

 during ant-infancy, her acquaintance is made with caution and 

 reserve, if not with signs of distrust or dislike. 



The ants appear to exhibit personal likings, aversions, affinities 

 and antipathies. They seem to make and to keep individual 

 acquaintances. They exhibit true social proclivities, and they 

 manifest a possibility of surmounting race prejudices. Living 

 mainly in darkness, they receive impressions through the antennse

rather than through the eyes, and they suggest the idea that the 

 sense of smell may be as efficient as that of sight in appropriately 

 connecting a creature with its environment. 



I have observed that these ants, like the Termites, are able to 

 carry water for domestic uses. They probably lap the water into 

 the pouch above the lower lip and eject it at its destination. A hun- 

 dred or two of ants that I brought in and left in a heap of dry 

 earth upon a Lubbock nest, during the ensuing uighi took water 

 from the surrounding moat, moistened a full pint of the earth, built 

 therein a proper nest, and were busy depositing their larv£e in its 

 recesses when I saw them on the following morning.

Kikai, Osumi (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 683). It occurs fossil with 

 a form of Eulota luhuana, a large form of E. sieboldiana, 

 Cyclophorm turgidus, and fragments of a Clausilia, in a calcareous 

 deposit consisting largely of foraminifera. 



Eulota (Plectotropis) omiensis n. sp. 



Shell small, openly umbilicate, low-conic above, convex beneath 

 carinate at the periphery, brown. Surface of the last whorl 

 shaggy with triangular cuticular scales, large for so small a shel.l 

 and longer at the periphery. Whorls 4*, convex, those of the 

 spire roughly striate, the last slightly and slowly descending in

 about one-fourth of the circle. Peristome thia, narrowly ex- 

 panded throughout, more dilated at -the columellar insertion.

Itauarai, Omi (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 752). 



Much like E. lepidophora var. tenuis Gude, but with fewer 

 whorls and more shaggy, large-scaled cuticle. 



Ganesella fausta n. sp. 



Shell resembling G. pagodula Ehrm. in contour; umbilicate, 

 very glossy, light chestnut colored. Sculpture of faint growth- 

 lines and excessively fine, subobsolete spiral strife. Spire high, 

 convexly conic. Whorls 5^, convex, the last rounded at the 

 periphery, very slightly descending in front, a trifle constricted 

 behind the lip. Base convex, impressed in the middle. Aperture 

 less oblique than in G. pcujodula, rounded, the parietal wall excis- 

 ing slightly less than a third of the circle ; peristome narrowly 

 expanded, the outer lip hardly reflexed, columellar margin dilated 

 above, half covering the umbilicus. Columella subvcrtical above. 



Alt. 13^, diam. 12^ mm. 



Mikuriya, Suruga (Mr. Y. Ilirase, No. 734). 



This form diflers from G. pagodula in its smaller size, fewer 

 whorls, dark color and glossy surface, the hollow axis and different 

 form of the columella. I do not think it directly related to ■(?. 

 pagodula. The two species are apparently independent offshoots 

 from the G. japonica stock. 



Ganesella Adelinae n. sp. 



Shell pyraniiilal, narrowly umbilicate, thin, pale yellow or rose- 

 whitish, with three equidistant blackish chestnut bauds ; the first 

 above the middle of the upper .surface of the last whorl, the 

 second at the periphery, the space between these two varying from 

 light red-brown to almost as dark as the bands themselves, which 

 are then confluent; the third baud is wider, in the miildle of the 

 basal surface; the interior of the umbilicus also dark. Surface 

 rather glossy but with a dull "bloom" sis in some forms of G. 

 LargiUierU, having slight wrinkles of growth and fine, subobso- 

 lete, spiral striae. Spire straightly conic, the apex obtuse, whorls

Oshima (Amani-Oshima), j\Ir. Y. Hirase, No. 352. 

 This charming species is closely related to G. Largillierti of 

 Okinawa, and has also some superficial resemblance to Eulota 

 calUzona var. Dixo7ii It differs from the former in the larger 

 umbilicus and the pyramidal rather than turbinate contour. 



A specimen I dissected has the exceedingly long kidney and 

 characteristic genitalia of Ganesella. As its close relationship to 

 Largillierti is obvious, that species can no longer be placed in 

 Eulota, as some authors have done. 

 Trishoplita hilgendorfi var. tenuis nov. 



Closely resembling T. hllgendorfi (Kob.), this form differs in 

 being thinner with perceptibly larger aperture, and the surface is 

 seen under a lens to be finely decussate, the fine growth-wrinkles 

 being cut into spiral series of long granules. Pale corneous- 

 brown, with inconspicuous darker streaks.

This species is distinguished among the crowd of Japanese 

 Kaliellas by its high, pyramidal contour and numerous whorls. 

 In outline it resembles Bitlivmiopsis turrita (Gude). It has not the

 sharper striation; and may be called var. hmehana. 



Alycsens satsumana n. sp. 



Shell with the general form of A. melanopoma, red-brown 

 becoming pale-brown beneath. Whorls 3A, the first smooth and

A QUICK METHOD OF TESTING FOK GOLD. 

 BY E. GOLDSMITH. 



The volcanic rocks of the crater in which the towns of Cripple 

 Creek ' and Victor, Colo., are built, according to Mr. Moore, the 

 chief raining engineer of the district, all contain gold. The rock 

 mined, however, is thrown on the dump and many thousands of 

 tons, not worked for the gold at present, are piled up outside the 

 mines. 



The vein gold, in the form of sjlvanite, telluride, and prob- 

 ably caJaverite, is separated by hand from the gangue or rock and 

 sent to the smelters for reduction. A specimen -was secured from 

 a depth of about 800 feet below the surface. Its general appear- 

 ance was not very promising, inasmuch as the minerals were so 

 finely divided that a mechanical separation for a test seemed to 

 involve a waste of time. Separation, melting and cupellation are 

 practiced extensively and are well known. A quicker and simpler 

 method for at least a qualitative determination of the gold iu the 

 rock can, 1 think, be devised. Since these and other gold com- 

 pounds are verj' fusible, it seemed probable that the small particles 

 of the gold salts may be fused together before the blowpipe in the 

 rock, and by shaking and driving with the pointed flame larger 

 globules may be formed. This jiroves to be the case. During 

 the process the tellurium and selenium, if present along with 

 other volatile bodies, are roasted, i. e., oxydized and expelled. The 

 flame is bluish green. After the volatile substances are thus 

 removed dark-colored globules project upward on the surface of 

 the rock-splinter, which was about one inch long and a quarter of 

 an inch thick. To clean these under the flame I covered the whole 

 surface with cyanide of potassium, a reducing fire finishing this 

 part of the work. 



The rock-spliuter was disintegrated; it broke easily and the 

 globules of dark metal could be picked up with the pointed pin- 

 cette or separated with a knife. These were put into the agate 

 mortar and pressed and rubbed with the pistil to thin plates. A 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 551 



little nitric acid was added and rubbed, then poured into a capsule; 

 a second dose of nitric acid was given and worked as before. The 

 gold appeared now, after washing with water, in its bright yellow 

 color. The acid solution, after settling, poured cleanly into a test- 

 tube, gave with a few drops of hydrochloric acid the well-known 

 while precipitate of chloride of silver soluble in ammonia. 



The gold was, as may be exjjected, in very thin plates, and, 

 although not absolutely pure, showed the two distinct colors of the 

 metal — the fine yellow by reflected light, and the violet color 

 when a ray of ordinary light passed through it and was observed 

 under the microscope by sunlight. By artificial light the color is 

 modified to a greenish tint. The test of a gold-containing mineral 

 in a rock, as described above, can be made within ten minutes. 

 The microscopic part of the test is, of course, unnecessary, as the 

 gold can be seen as readily without it after the treatment with 

 nitric acid. 



The ease and quickness of this blowpipe process and the little 

 preparation required may recommend it to prospectors for gold 

 ore, who, we are well aware, often overlook gold-containing min- 

 erals in the absence of an easy and simple test. The above-described 

 method, if followed, may be found helpful, inasmuch as no new 

 instrument or apparatus is required. 



The finely and sparsely distributed gold compounds in the Crip- 

 ple Creek volcanic rock have a similarity in appearance to com- 

 mon pyrites. In volcanic rocks, therefore, wherein both minerals 

 may occur, the gold and iron compounds present can only be deter- 

 mined by the application of tlie proper tests.

 Dr. J. W. Velie, who in sending a specimen to the Academy had 

 directed attention to the peculiarities of the form. Dr. Pilsliry 

 stated that the specimens are referable to the form described by 

 Philippi' as Fasciolaria reevei Jonas. That form has been lost sight 

 of by later observers. Those authors who have noticed it have con- 

 sidered it to be a synonym of F. princeps, a species of the Panamic 

 zoological province, from which it differs iu the gradual decrease in 

 promiuence of the sculpture with age and the smooth operculum. 



It seems to be a local subspecies of F. cjiyantea, differing from 

 that by its much smaller size, the obsolescence or absence of nodes 

 on the last whorl, the longer and narrower anterior portion, etc. 

 The shell reaches a length of 24 cm., and is covered with a dark 

 cuticle, blackish-chestnut on the last whorl, yellowish-chestnut ou

The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia is 

 again called (m to record its sense of loss in the death of one of its 

 oldest and most devoted associates. Since Mr. Meehan's election to 

 membership forty-one years ago he never neglected an opportunity 

 to manifest his interest in the society, and for much the greater part 

 of that period he gave freely of his time, means and best thought 

 for the increase of its prosperity. His special care for the welfare 

 of the Botanical Departmeat was manifested with singular devo- 

 tion until physical exertion was no longer possible, and the Academy 

 is well aware that the present prosperous condition of the herba- 

 rium is mainly due to his intelligent efforts. 



While his extraordinary accuracy as an observer and his clear- 

 ness as a recorder of natural phenomena place a high value on his 

 scientific work, he was personally endeared to his fellow-members 

 by unfailing courtesy, integrity and generosity. Their regard 

 enables them to appreciate the more fully the loss sustained by his 

 wife and family, to whom they tender this assurance of their 

 heartfelt commiseration. 



John M. Macfarlane, D.Sc. , was requested to prepare a bio- 

 graphical notice of Mr. Meehan, to be read at a meeting of the 

 Academy and published in the Proceedings.

AN ECOLOGICAL SKETCH OF THE FLORA OF SANTO DOMISGO, 

 BY JOHN W. HAESHBERGER, PH.D. 



The i:-land of Santo Domingo (Hispauola of Columbus) is 

 politically divided into an eastern and a western portion. The 

 eastern section, by far the largest, comprises the Republic of 

 Santo Domingo, and the western area, the smallest, is dominated 

 by the blacks of the Haitian Republic. The island of Santo 

 Domingo is one of extreme fertility. Columbus, and traveler 

 since, speak in the highest terms of the rare beauty and natural 

 grandeur of the island, which has been called without exaggera- 

 tion " The Queen of the Antilles." 



Topography. 



Hispariola by nature is the geographic centre of the Greater 

 Antilles. Thomas Jefferys in 1760 said: "Its situation with 

 respect to the rest of the Antilles is the most advantageous imag- 

 inable, as it stands, you may say, in the (centre of this great cluster 

 of islands, and looks as if intended by nature to give laws to 

 them. The other three great Antilles lie in such a manner as to 

 prove its superiority, and their own dependence ; for it has three 

 points of land corresponding respectively to each island " (Puerto 

 Rico, Cuba, Jamaica). Santo Domiago excels Puerto Rico, Cuba 

 and Jamaica in altitude, diversity of configuration, picturesque 

 aspect and natural fertilit}'. It is continental in its topographic 

 make-up, being the radiating centre of the great Antilleau ujjlift. 

 The outline of Hispauola is the most irregular of all the Greater 

 Antilles, its periphery being nearly a thousand miles, its length 

 400 miles, and its breadth 160 miles. The great Gulf of Gonaives 

 is enclosed by the western j)eninsulas, and is an immense semicircu- 

 lar bay with a coast line of two luiudi-ed miles. Saraana Bay on 

 the northeast, Barahona Bay on the south coast and ^lanzanilla 

 Bay on the north are also conspicuous indentations. Approached 

 from the ocean, the island presents a huge mass of mountain* 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. .55.5 



rising precipitously from the sea, extendiug in all directions and 

 apparently jumbled up in hopeless confusion. The mountains 

 consist of lofty forest-covered peaks, resembling the Alleghenies, 

 the Alps or the Pyrenees, but with this difference, that they are 

 always without snow. There are four ranges of mountains which 

 run in a general east-and-west direction, as follows: The northern 

 fragment is the Monte Cristi Range; the main orographic section, 

 the sierra Cibao, consists of lofty mountains, with the third ran-e 

 as an outlier toward the southwest, and the fourth mass is formed 

 by the tall mountains of the southwestern peninsula. Between 

 these ranges lie extensive fertile valleys, threaded by streams of 

 hmpid water. Many of these streams debouch on the plains which 

 fringe the sea-coast, and irrigate those coastal aress which are 

 more or less arid in condition, being shut off from the prevailing 

 winds and rains by lofty mountain summits. There are many 

 central valley plains in the island. The largest of these, lying 

 between the Monte Cristi Range and the Cordillera Cibao, extends 

 from the sea at the Haitian border to Samana Bay, its eastern 

 prolongation. The western portion, watered by the Yaqui, is an 

 and region covered by chaparral, where arborescent opuntias and 

 cereuses abound. The windward area, or eastern division, watered 

 by the \una, is covered by beautiful deciduous plants. South of 

 the Cibao Range is the extensive plain of Seylo, covered in part by 

 open prairie and forest. The terraced Caribbean coast supports a 

 belt of forest averaging twelve miles in width. The tension line 

 between coastal forest and inland prairie is parklike in aspect 

 carpeted by green grass and dotted by clumps of trees. At Azua, 

 the whole neighborhood is barren, dry and thorny. The only 

 lakes are salt, occupying the east-and-west depression which sep- 

 arates the southern peninsula of Haiti from the main portion of 

 the island. This basin, formerly an oceanic inlet, is said to be 

 inhabited still by sharks, porpoises and even crocodiles 



The configuration of the Haitian division of the island appears 

 an agglomeration of mountains, hills and valleys most irregular in 

 form. There are precipices, deep hollows, vales apparently with- 

 out outlet, but with water glistening below. The whole of the 

 Republic IS more or less mountainous. The La Haute Mountains 

 are most noted and they form a continuation of the great axial 

 aerra of the island. There are many beautiful slopes and vallevs 




•556 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV., 



Those of Port-au-Prince, Gonaives, Artibnnite, Arcahaie, Port 

 Margot, Lcogane, Aux Cayes being the most famous. Three 

 large islands are attached to the Haitian coast — Tortuga on the north, 

 Gonave on the west are noted for their mahogany trees; L'lle-a- 

 Vache on the south coast lies in a sound of the same name. 



Climate. 



The dry season covers the period of the year from October to 

 April, when the temperature is some 10° lower than during the 

 so-called rainy season, which lasts from April to October, when 

 rains fall, as a rule, late in the afternoons or evenings. In gen- 

 eral, the climate of the island of Santo Domingo is most diversi- 

 fied, presenting wide extremes of moisture, aridity and tem- 

 perature. At the sea-level, in sheltered places, the heat is intense, 

 hat as one ascends the mountains of the interior the heat of 

 the seaboard becomes moderated. At 1,600 feet, European and 

 American travelers complain of cold at night, although there the 

 mercury never falls below 45°. Rain is almost lacking on the 

 lower slopes of sheltered mountains, but above 2,000 feet rains and 

 dews are copious. The nights are from 10° to 20° cooler than the 

 days. 



Ecology. 



The information for the following ecologic sketch was obtained 

 ■from three sources: (1) The observations of the writer made 

 upon the flora of Haiti during July, 1901, when he visited the 

 island, stopping at four ports, viz., Cape Haiticn, Port-au-Prince, 

 Aux Cayes and Jacmel; (2) The information gleaned by conversa- 

 tion with inhabitants of the island familiar with its vegetation ; 

 (3) A careful perusal of Tippenhauer's book, Die Insel Haiti. 

 It is impossible to give a detailed sketch of the phytogeography 

 of the island of Hispaiiola. It seems, therefore, best to a.ssemble 

 the species in an ecologic manner as a basis for a future work 

 upon this rich and most luxuriant insular vegetation. 



JJijdrophjles. — Living along shore in the bays and shallow estua- 

 ries is found an abundant mangrove vegetation. In Port-au-Prince 

 Bay, at Cape Haitien, at Aux Cayes, are found extensive man- 

 grove swamps and islands. The three trees concerned in forming 

 the mangrove association are Rhlzophora mangle L. , Avicennia 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. .557 



officinalis L. and Laguncularia racemosa Gaerfn. Pldia stratiotes 

 U floats m the fresh- water streams of the island, or loosely 

 attached to the soil along their banks. Sagittaria lancifolia L 

 may also be classed as a hydrophyte. 



3fesophyte.s.-The plants composing the vegetation of a tropical 

 forest are m superimposed layers, or stories. The different levels 

 at which tropical plants grow is in direct response to the environ- 

 mental conditions of light and moisture. These storied layers 

 may be termed vegetal strata. It may be staled, m this con- 

 nection as axiomatic, that in a tropical forest, when one ascends 

 from the ground to the crown of the dominant forest trees, as the 

 light increases the moisture content oi the air decreases On the 

 ground m the forest, mosses, ferns and fungi abound in the deep 

 shadow and growing in the mould arising from fallen leaves and 

 rotting wood. In the forests, on the trees, ferns, aroids and orchids 

 are found, while serpent-like lianes clamber from limb to limb 

 and from tree to tree, until they reach abundant light in the 

 crowns of the trees above. Epiphytes and parasites, more or less 

 xerophytic in habit, are found in the tops of the dominant species 

 of trees. '■ 



Forest Vegetation. -The richness of the tropical flora and the 

 lush growth of the vegetation in general is most marked in tho«e 

 situations that are exposed to the copious rains chat fall durin- the 

 summer months. The drenvhing rainfall, the richness of the soil 

 in the mountain valleys and coastal plains are such as to encour- 

 age to the highest degree a luxuriant fern and arboreal ve-etation 

 Along the banks of streams occur Bambusa vulgaris Schrad ' 

 Hehcoma sp., Amomum sp., and of the palms, Oreodoxa oleracea 

 Mart., Thnnax argentea Lodd, T. parviflora Sw., Acrocomia 

 sclerocarpa Blart., Euterpe oleracea Engelm. 



The component vegetation of damp woods consists of Musa

 corum L., Arundo occidentalis Sieber, Cannu edulis Ker-Gawl

folia L., p. perfoUata L., Aristolochia arborescens L. , Entada 

 scandens Benth. , Philodendron lacerum Schott. and Vitis caribcsa 

 D.C. 



Savanna Vegetation. — The green covering of the open park- 

 like areas, or savannas, consists of grasses and other herbaceous 

 plants. The grasses are of most interest from an economic stand- 

 point and should be mentioned first. The following seem to be 

 the chief components of the grassy stretches of savanna land: 

 Paspalum platycaule Poir, P. dislichum TAna., P. virgatum Linn., 

 P. paniculatum Linn., Chloris ciliata Sw., C cnwiata Sw., C. 

 barbata Sw., Paniciim colonum Linn., P. maximum Jacq., P. 

 hirsidum Sw., Andropogon saccJiaroides Sw., A. gracilis Spreng.^ 

 A. fastigiatus Sw., A. hiconik L., A. leucostachys H. B. and K., 

 Eragrostis ciliata, witli herbaceous plants, Desmodium axillare 

 D. C. and Boerhaavia erecta Linn. 



Epiphytes. — The large trees, such as the fig,?, the mahogany, the 

 silk cotton, are loaded down with a considerable number of 

 epiphytes belonging to the orchid, fern, cactus and arnid families. 

 Foremost among these air-dwellers are two members of the natural 

 order Cactacese, viz., Cereus triangularis JMill and Rhipsalis cas- 

 sytha Gaertn., which live in the crotches or attached to the upper 

 side of the limbs of tropical forest trees. Here are seen, also, 

 Philodendron lacerum Schott., Polypodium axireum L., Vittaria 

 lineata Swartz, species of Epidendrum, and the following plants of 

 the genus Tillandsia : T. angustifolia Sw., T. complanata Benth., 

 T. bulbbsa Hook., 1\ compressa Bert., T. excelsa Griseb., T. 

 fasciculata Sw., T. flexuosa Sw., T. /aa;a Griseb., T. prninosa Sw., 

 T. setacea Sw., T. usneoides Linn. 



The aerial life, therefore, seems to be of incontestible value to 

 these plants. Here they are installed in a position which offers the 

 largest amount of sunlight, and this advantage of increased 

 illumination seems to outweigh any disadvantage which the species 

 might have in running a constant risk of death by desiccation. 



Parasites. — There are a number of true parasites to be found 

 attached to and living upon the trunk and limbs of various tropi- 

 cal forest trees. Parasites of the genus Phoradendron, with 

 rounded or four-cornered stems, opposite or whorled, palmately 

 veined, leathery leaves, are among the most prominent. The 

 following species of the genus have been recorded as occurring in 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 559 



the island: Phoradendron berteriarmm Nutt., P. Jlavescens Nutt., 

 P. schottii Nutt., P. rubrum Nutt. The genus DendropJithora 

 (formerly included in Arceuthobium) consists of parasites, that 

 are represented in the Santo Domingan flora by Dendrophthora 

 cupressoides Eichl., D. gracile Eichl., D. opuntioides Eichl. 



Xerophytes. — The writer has briefly alluded to the stretches of 

 country that may be said to be of arid nature in referring to the 

 topography of Santo Domingo. These desertic areas are usually 

 found on the slopes of mountains and in valleys that are sheltered 

 by their position from the prevalent summer rains. These rains 

 may be denominated trade-wind rains, because they owe their 

 origin to the strong evaporation of water within the zone of the 

 trades. If the trade wind encounters a mouutainous island, or a 

 bald continental coast, the ascent of air over such obstructions 

 cools it, and the water in the clouds, thus formed, descends as 

 rain. For this reason the windward slopes of Santo Domingo are 

 well watered, while the leeward slopes are comparatively dry. 

 Again, if the trade winds blow over a land of moderate elevation 

 no precipitation occurs, but the winds reduce its surface to a dry 

 desert by depriving it of moisture. In the Republic of Haiti, as 

 well as in that of Santo Domingo, there are many arid situations 

 which owe their barrenness to just such causes. Consequently in 

 such arid districts we naturally look for a xerophytic flora. The 

 species which exist in such situations are the following: Opuntia 

 tuna Mill., O. spinossissima Mill., Cereus moniliformis D.C. , C. 

 grandijiorus Mill., Nopalea coccinellifera Salm Dyck, Mammillaria 

 simplex Haw., Melocactus communis Link and Otto, Pereskia 

 aculeata Mill.' To this list of succulents belonging to the cactus 

 order should be added several other fleshy plants, viz., Agave sobo 

 lifera Salm Dyck and Aloe vulgaris Lam. The arid hillsides are 

 generally covered, in addition to the xerophytes mentioned above, 

 with thickets of Acacia far nesiana WiUd., A. spharocephala Chara. 

 and Schlecht. , the raezquite, Prosopis juliflora D. C. , Yucca 

 aloifolia Linn, and Yucca gloriosa Linn. 



The native flora has been undisturbed on the slopes of the higher 

 mountains inland. Some of the most valuable timber trees have 

 been removed, but cutting them has rather improved the botanical 

 interest of the country, because the smaller plants have thus had 

 a chance to grow. Around the dwellings, however, and in the 




560 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV. , 



cultivated valleys, great changes have been worked in the flora. 

 The indigenous plants have been slowly replaced by introductions 

 from tropical and temperate climes. 



A. typical valley which has been modified by human agency was 

 visited by the writer near the town of Cape Haitien, on the north 

 coast of the island. A description of the flora of this valley will 

 serve to illustrate the influence of cultivation upon the primitive 

 surroundings. The ravine in question is situated just back of thfr 

 town of Cape Haitien, between the mountain of the cape and the 

 main range to the south and southwest. A mountain stream of 

 limpid water runs down through the depression, and a bridle path 

 winds its way to the top of the hills overlooking the sea. Both 

 banks of the brook are covered with arborescent vegetation, except 

 where the gardens of houses are found, or where bauaua j)lantatious 

 are made. The following trees are met in the rich soil of the 

 valley: The' bread-fruit, Artocarpus indsa Linn. ; the star-apple, 

 ChrysopJiyllnm eainito Linn. ; the mango, Mangifcra indica Linn. ; 

 the banana, Mimi sapientum Linn. ; the bamboo, Bavihusa 

 vulgaris Schrad. ; the coffee, Coffea arabica Linn. ; the guava, 

 Psidium guajava lAnn. ; the trumpet tree, Cecropiu jiellata Linn.; 

 the chocolate, Theobroma cacao Linn. ; the alligator pear, Persea 

 gratissima Gaertn. The banana fields are plauted on the steep 

 declivities and consist of a pure growth witliout the admixture of 

 coffee plants and chocolate shrubs. Along the roadside are found 

 the following: Adiantum pcdatum Linn., A-splemum peUucidum (f), 

 Argemone mexicana Liun., Lepidium virginicum Linn., Mimosa 

 pudica Linn., Momordica charantia Linn., Hibiscus trilobus Aubl. 



An occasional small maize field is interspersed with banana 

 plantations. The gardens of the houses along these roads are not 

 rich in species or in showy plants. Most of them suffer from 

 neglect. There is an ai)pareut poverty of decorative plants and a 

 great uniformity is noticeable in the garden plants of adjacent 

 properties. A list of a few garden plants may here be given : 

 Musa sapientum Linn., Hibiscus esculenlns Linn., H. sabdariffa 

 Linn., Lycopersicum csculcntum Mill., Solamim melongena Linn., 

 Cneurbita pepo Linn., Gynandropsis pentaphyllu D. C, Capsicum 

 annuum Linn., C. baccatum Linn., Zingiber officinale Rose, 

 Dioscorea alatn Linn., Punica gi-anatum Linn., Fragaria vesca 

 Linn. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 561 



Near Port-au-Prince a hillside was visited which supported an 

 almost pure growth of lignum vitse, Guaiacwn officinale Linn. ; the 

 mezquite, Prosopis juliflora D. C, and the acacias, Acacia sphwro- 

 eephalu Cham, and Schleeht. , Acacia farnesiana Willd., while on 

 rocky outcrops in open places in these woods was found a growth- 

 of yuccas, probably Yucca aloijolia Liun. 



This brief sketch of the ecology of the flora of Santo Domingo 

 suffices to show that an interesting and profitable fieldjof investiga- 

 tion lies at the doors of the American botanist. The West Indies, 

 in their varied topographical configuration, are especially adapted 

 for philosophical inquiry into the causes which have influenced 

 the distribution of plants on the North American continent. The 

 writer believes, since his visit to Haiti and Jamaica, that^the solu- 

 tion of this phyto-geographic problem will follow a careful biologi- 

 cal survey of the fauna and flora of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.

AlyosBus tanegashimae "■ '^p. 



Shell similar in shape to ^4. harimensis. Pale brown, the early 

 whorls orange-red, or uniform whitish-corneous. Whorls 3J, the 

 last slowly descending, moderately constricted, then swollen again. 

 Sculpture of crowded rib-striie, finer at the constriction; no spiral 

 striae. Aperture very oblique, circular, the peristome double. 

 Operculum nearly smooth, the edges of the whorls slightly pro- 

 jecting. 



Alt. 1.7. diam. .3 mm. 



Tane-ga-shima, Osumi (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 72.3). 



Closely related to A. harimeiisk, but that is a much larger 

 species. 

 Caryohium pessimum n. sp. 



Shell very minute, corneous-white, fusiform-conic, minutely 

 striate. AVhorls 4|. convex. Aperture ovate, the peristome well 

 expanded, very inuch thickened within, with a strong tooth-like 

 prominence just above the middle of the outer lip, marked by a 

 groove behind the lip. Columella truncate below, the columellar 

 lamella small, receding. 



Length 1.8 mm. 



Tane-ga-shima, Osumi (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 729). 



This species is smaller and less conically tapering than C. nodu- 

 liferum Reinh. "^ The columellar lamella is smaller, much less 

 prominent than in either C. noduliferitm or C. cymatuplax. 

 Haoroohlamys dulcis " ^^p- 



Shell depres.sed, brownish-yellow, rather transparent, narrowly 

 perforate. Surface brilliantly glossy, weakly marked by growth- 

 lines, and under a strong lens seen to be engraved with excessively 

 fine, crowded spiral lines, which are obsolete on the upper and 

 peripheral portions of the last whorl. Spire a little convex, nar- 

 row. Whorls 4i, slowly widening, the last very^wide, concave at

the suture, rounded peripherally and less so beneath, narrowly 

 impressed around the umbilical perforation. Aperture large, but 

 slightly oblique, very broadly lunate; peristome simple, a little 

 retracted at the upper insertion, basal margin straightened, the 

 columellar margin short, subvertical, dilated. 



Alt. 6, greater diam. 11^, lesser 10 mm. 



Nachi, Prov. Kii (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 785). 



Well marked by the narrow perforation, small spire, sculpture 

 and the shape of the aperture. M. perfrarjilk Pils. of Kunchan, 

 Okinawa, is a closely related species, differing in the much larger 

 size, smaller perforation, etc. 



Eulota (Pleototropis) pannosa n. sp. 



Shell similar io irochula A. Ad. in general shape; light brown, 

 somewhat translucent. Surface slightly shining, sculptured with 

 very minute spiral strire under sparsely scaly oblique cuticular 

 stria;, with, at the periphery, a long, ragged fringe of flattened 

 filaments, triangular at their bases. Spire low-conic. Whorls 

 slightly over 6, slowly and regularly increasing, a little convex, 

 acutely carinate peripherally, convex beneath, being elevated and 

 subangular around the deep, broadly open umbilicus; the last 

 whorl very slightly descending in front. Aperture oblique, the 

 peristome hardly expanded above, thickened within and expanded 

 and somewhat reflexed below. 



Alt. 8J-, diam. (exclusive of fringe) 17 mm.; width of umbili- 

 cus (from suture to suture) 4i mm. 



Atsumi, Prov. Uzen (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 773). 



This species difJers from E. trochula in being much more angular 

 around the umbilicus, trochula being rounded there. E. vulgivaga 

 is a more solid shell, with the umbilicus wider and the base more 

 convex. 



Enlota (Pleototropis) deflexa ". sp. 



Shell small, biconvex, widely and openly umbilicate, brown. 

 Surface dull, sculptured with subobsolete, fine spiral stria and slight 

 spaced growth-wrinkles, bearing a few cuticular threads and scales 

 above, more numerous short scales beneath, with a peripheral fringe 

 of flattened, ragged filaments. Spire low-conic. Whorls 5^. the 

 first li convex, following whorls less so, the last whorl acutely 

 carinate, descending near the aperture for some distance and rather 




564 PROCEEDINGS OF TBE ACADEMY OF [NoV. , 



deeply below the keel; the base convex, subangular around the 

 umbilicus. Aperture oblique, rounded, the peristome arcuate, 

 unexpanded and thin above, narrowly expanded and subreflexed 

 below the periphery, the margins approaching, separated by the 

 nearly straight parietal margin, which forms less than one-fourth 

 the total circumference of the peristome. 



Alt. 5.5, diam. 10.8 mm.; width of umbilicus (from suture to 

 suture) 3 mm. 



Tobishima, Prov. Ugo (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 774). 

 This species is related to Eulota {Plectotropis) cemula Gude, but 

 it is smaller with fewer whork, the last descending in front and 

 with a developed, though usually incomplete, peripheral fringe. 

 E. deflexa is also less conic above, and the nepionic 1^ whorls pro- 

 ject somewhat. 

 Eulota (JEgistal aperta vnr. cavata "ov. 



Larger and more elevated than aperta, with 6^ to 6| whorls, the 

 umbilicus larger, more widely open. Ai)erture more oblique, the 

 basal margin more deeply arcuate. 



Alt. 9, diam. 16, width of umbihcus 6 mm. 

 Alt. 8, diam. 17, width of umbilicus 6i mm. 

 Tomisato, Kii (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 761). 



This form approaches E. {JEijida) kohensu somewhat, but that 

 is still more open beneath, with the aperture more elliptic. Some 

 specimens from Gojo, Yaraato (Mr. Hirase's No. 567), are to some 

 extent intermediate between aperta and cavata in shape, as they 

 are in geographic position. 

 Trishoplita Hilgendorfl var. ohikubashimEB nov. 



Shell smaller and thinner than kUgendorfi from the top of Mt. 



Ibuki, Omi; very densely and minutely but subobsoletely granu- 



lose; angular at the periphery in front, the umbilicus smaller. 



Spire conic; whorls 5 in small, 5J in large specimens. Aperture 



rounded-lun.ite, the peristome thin, expanded. 



Alt. 7i, diam. 10^- mm. 



Alt. 7, diam. 9i mm. 



Alt. 6, diam. 8^ mm. 



Chikubashima, au island in Lake Biwa (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 



746). 



In describing T. Hilgendorfi var. temiis in these Proceedings, p. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 565 



647, I neglected to state that while Hilgendorfi occurs at the top of 

 Mt. Ibuki, the var. tenuis is found in a valley below. ^ 



Trishoplita tosana vnr. anozona nov. 



Shell thin and glossy like tosana, and resembling that species in 

 shape and the size of the umbihcus, but differing from it in want- 

 ing a pale zone below the suture. It has a narrower umbilicus than 

 T. Hilgendorfi var. tenuis. 



Alt. 8J, diam. 13 mm. 



Alt. 7, diam. 11| mm. 



Akasaka, Mino (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 7516). 



Still another form of this terrible genus, which I will call T. 

 tosana var. ruja, occurs at Kashima, Harima. It resembles ano- 

 zona, but is dull, russet-colored, densely striate spirally beneath, 

 subangular at the periphery in front. Whorls 5i to 5;|, the spire 

 conic. 



Alt. 8, diam. 11^ mm. 



Chloritis Hirasei "• sp. 



Shell openly umbilicate, depressed, thin and fragile, flattened 

 above, the earlier whorls a trifle sunken; pale brown. Surface 

 lustreless, densely beset with dehcate hairs arranged in oblique 

 sweeps. Whorls 4^, the last wide, rounded at the periphery and 

 beneath, hardly descending in front. Aperture lunate, the peri- 

 stome thin, a little expanded, somewhat dilated at the columellar 

 insertion. 



Alt. %^, greatest diam. 17^, width of umbilicus 2f mm. 



Kurozu, Prov. Kii (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 786). 



This species is larger and flatter than C fragilis Glide, with 

 more densely placed hairs, and a much wider umbilicus. C. osci- 

 tans V. Mart., a form of which Mr. Hirase sends from Mikuriya, 

 Prov. Suruga, is a smaller, almost imperforate species, the most 

 northern of its genus. No exact locality has hitherto been reported 

 for von Marten's species. C. eucharistus Pils., of Oshima, also 

 brought to light by Mr. Hirase, is the finest Chloritis of the 

 Japanese Empire, these four species being all known from Japan 

 to this time. 

 Ganesella tanegashimae var. dulois ii- var. 



Similar to the type except in color, the shell being of a very 

 dark and beautiful chestnut color,- with a blackish peripheral

band. The interior is purple witl»a bluish gleam, and the lip 

 purple. 



Alt. 181 diam. 26 mm. 



Tane-ga-shima. 



Only two living specimens of this superb variety were taken. 

 Dead shells are reddish rather than chestnut. 

 Ganesella selasia ". sp. 



Shell umbilicate, trochiform, brown or corneous-brown, very 

 glossy, striatulate, finely malleate in places. Spire conic; whorls 

 5f, convex, slowly increasing, t]\e last depressed, subangular at 

 the periphery, somewhat convex below, slightly descending in 

 front, narrowly constricted behind the lip. Aperture oblique, 

 somewhat triangular, the peristome thin, arcuate and narrowly 

 expanded above and outwardly, the basal margin straight, or sinu- 

 ous, reflexed, thickened (like a low, wide tooth) within; cohimel- 

 lar margin short, dilated. 



Alt. Hi, diam. 16, width of umbilicus 1^ mm. 



Alt. Hi, diam. 15, width of umbilicus IJ mm. 



Nachi, Prov. Kii (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 788). 



The glossy surface, narrow whorls and open umbilicus separate 

 this from all forms of G. japonica. ' 

 Ganesella oristata n. sp- 



Shell imperforate, globose-trochiform, pale russet, with a faint 

 brown line at the periphery, a pale line below it. Surface very 

 ohsoleiely and indidinetly papillose, somewhat dull. Spire a little 

 convexly conic. Whorls 5f to 6J^, convex, the last rounded per- 

 ipherally. Abruptly descending in front, expanding in a conspicuous 

 ridge or crest and then strongly contracted behind the lip. Aperture 

 obliquo, somewhat triangular, the upper and outer margins ex- 

 panded, thickened within, basal margin straightened, reflexed, 

 indistinctly toothed or thickened within ; coluniollar margin short, 

 abruptly expanded over and covering the umbilicus. 



Alt. 14, diam. 16 mm. 



Alt. Hi, diam. 15 mm. 



Nachi, Prov. Kii (:\Ir. Y. Hirase, No. 7836). 



The absence of spiral lines on the slightly dull, silken surface, 

 the closure of the umbilicus, and the crest behind the lip all mark 

 this as a species distinct from the G. japonica series. The smaller 

 specimens are obtusely subangular in front. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 567 



Ganesella japonica vai'. granulosa "ov. 



In this race the shell is trochiform, umbib'cate, strongly carinate 

 at the periphery, irregularly wrinkle-striate, minutely, very obso- 

 letely granulose, with some faint spiral lines or none. It is light 

 brown, not corneous or corneous-brown, as in japonica. Two 

 forms have been received, a larger and smaller. 



Alt. 14, diam. 19 mm. (large form, No. 5136 of Mr. Hirase's 

 Coll.). 



Alt. 13, diam. I4h mm. (small form. No. 513c of Mr. Hirase's 

 Coll.). 



Alt. 11, diam. 15 mm. (small form. No. 513c of Mr. Hirase's 

 Coll.). 



Ibuki Mountain, Prov. Omi. The small form occurs also at 

 Kyoto. 



Ganesella japonica var. oarinata Pilsbry and A. Gulick, nov. 



This is a large, very strongly carinate shell, openly umbilicate, 

 yellowish-corneous, and finely striate spirally like G. japonica. 

 Whorls 5^ to nearly 6. 



Alt. 18, diam. 26 mm. 



Alt. 16, diam. 23 mm. 



Ibuki, Omi (Mr. Y. Hirase, No. 513a). Types No. 79,202, 

 Coll. A. N. S. P. 



This is apparently the "Helix patruelis Ad.," "H. fabitensis 

 Ancey," of authors; but after a careful examination of the 

 evidence, a year or two ago, Mr. Gulick and I concluded that it 

 could not be identical with the form described by Adams and 

 renamed by Ancey. It is apparently an independent local moun- 

 tain race of G. japonica. 



The sculpture, paler color, and less trochiform shape separate it 

 from the large form of G. japonica granulosa, which is apparently 

 a parallel modificatioa of the papillose or granular type of the G. 

 japonica stock.

SOME ARACHNIDA FKOM NEW MEXICO. 

 BY XATHAN BANKS. 



The following list of New ]\Iexicaa Arachuida is based chiefly 

 on material collected dui-ing the past few years by Prof. T. D. A. 

 Cockerell. A few species were collected by his wife and son. 

 Prof. C. H. T. Townsend, when connected with the New jSIexico 

 Agricultural Experiment Station, collected and sent to me a small 

 lot of spiders from the vicinity of Las Cruces. The late Mr. 

 Hugo Soltau sent me a very interesting collection from Albu- 

 querque, containing a number of forms not taken by others. I 

 have added the few species recorded by other writers from New 

 Mexico, but not seen by me. 



The total sums up to 148 species, nineteen of which appear to 

 be new and are here described. The leading groups may be 

 tabulated as follows : 



Araneida, 123 



Phalangida, 6 



Pseudoscorpionida 3 



Scorpiouida 2 



Solpugida, 3 



Acarina, 11 



Total, 148 



■"' The spiders are included in seventeen families; the leading 

 family in point of numbers is the Attidas with twenty-two species; 

 the others are : Thomisidx with sixteen, Theridiidic with sixteen, 

 EpeiridiB with thirteen, and the Lycosidx with ten species. Of 

 especial interest are the species of Pachylomerus, Meriola, Corinna, 

 O.vijopes, Fuentes and Taracim. The list shows many nortliern as 

 well as southern forms. The species of Xortliern distribution are 

 mostly from Beulah and Las Vegas. The Southern forms come 

 mostly from Mesilla and Las Cruces. Of the species of northern 

 distribution, many of which occur across the northern part of 

 our country, attention may be drawn to the following forms: 




1901.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 569 



Drassodes robustus, Poeeilochroa montaua, Gnaphosa conspersa, 

 Tltanceea americana, Grammonota pietilis, Telratjnatha extensa, 

 Epeira aculeata, Xysticus montanensis, Lycosa modesta, Pardosa 

 glacialis, leius similis, Habrocestum oregonense and Phalangiuvi 

 einereum. These species ally the fauna very strongly to that of 

 Colorado. 



The Southern element contains several species not previously 

 known from north of the Mexican boundary. The most charac- 

 teristic of these species are Physocyelus globosus, Gnaphosa didinda, 

 Syspira sp., Didyna texana, Epeira nqihiloides, Epeira oaxensis, 

 Ebo viexicana, Olios fnscicnlatu--', Phidippus bieolor, Sadala distincta, 

 AmmotrecJia peninsulana and Lithyphautcs fulcws. There does not 

 appear to be any particular connection between this fauna and that 

 of Arizona, although, of course, there are a number of forms com- 

 mon to both. These forms are such as are rather widely distributed 

 in the West. Of the six harvest-men, one is a northeastern form, 

 one a northwestern one, two arc typical Colorado species, and two 

 are known ciiiefly from New Mexico. Of the three Pseudoscorpions, 

 one is a typical Colorado species and two are California forms. 



The collection, as a whole, contains few bright-colored species, 

 and none are of very large size. In fact, many of the specimens 

 are smaller than those from more northerly regions. 



Mr. Cockerell gives the following notes on localities: 



(1) The ]\Iesilla Valley, about 3,800 feet, includes Mesilla 

 Park and Mesilla (collections by Cockerell) and Las Cruces 

 (collections by Townsend; a few specimens by Cockerell). These 

 places are all close together, and are in the Middle Sonoran zone. 



(2) Organ Mountains; collections at La Cueva and Fillmore 

 Canon by Townsend, and at Dripping Spring by Cockerell. These 

 mountains may be considered Upper Sonoran ; they form the 

 easterQ boundary of the Mesilla Valley. 



(3) White Mountains; collections by Townsend. This includes 

 the localities cited as Ruidoso creek and Eagle creek. The moun- 

 tains form an isolated range of considerable altitude, and possess 

 some endemic mollusca, at least. 



(4) Albuquerque; collections by Soltau. This is Upper Son- 

 oran. 



(5) Las Vegas; collections by Cockerell. This has an altitude 

 of about 6,400 feet, and is Upper Sonoran, tinged with Transi- 




570 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV., 



tion. Las Vegas Hot Springs (collection by Cockerell) is more 

 decidedly Transition. 



(tj) Santa Ft- (collections by Cockerell) is Transition. Altitude 

 7,000 feet. 



(7) Beulah, Sapello Caiion (collections by Cockerell), is in the 

 Las Vegas range, and has an altitude of about 8,000 feet. This 

 belongs to the Canadian zone; the only other arachnids of this 

 zoae listed are some from the White Mountains. 



(8) Top of range between the Sapello and Pecos rivers, about 

 11,000 feet; collection by Cockerell. This belongs tj the Hud- 

 sonian zone.

A PECULIAR CONDITION OF (EDOGONIUM. 

 BY IDA A. KELLER. 



For several years I have kept a jar of water at my window, in 

 whicli I have found interesting things at different times. Last fall 

 there was a luxuriant growth of a dense green mat, which turned 

 out to be a species of (Edogonium. Later on, as the color gradu- 

 ally disappeared, I took for granted that the plant was about to die, 

 and gave it no further attention. The next time I happened to 

 observe the jar the alga seemed to have been replaced by a hea\'}' 

 growth of the mycelium of some fungus. This remained in a 

 thriving condition all winter, and proved on examination, to mj- 

 great surjirise, not to be a fungus at all, but the CEklogonium 

 which had lost its chlorophyll. In all other respects the alga was 

 apparently in a perfectly healthy condition, its filaments were 

 rooted fast to pieces of rock which were in the bottom of the jar, 

 the cells showed absolutely no signs of decomposition — further- 

 more, they were remarkably well packed with granules which 

 turned out to be starch. 



This phenomenon seemed to me an unusual one. I know of no 

 alga which continues to live after it loses its chlorophyll, nor can 

 I recall any parallel case among the higher plants — a water-plant 

 which ceases its assimilating activity, full of the most attractive 

 bait for bacteria, in nowise protected from them, and yet of suffi- 

 cient vitality to withstand all attacks of these ever-present enemies. 



The condition of the plant in May may be summed up as fol- 

 lows: The filaments are rooted to pieces of rock. To the naked 

 eye they seem perfectly colorless and form a dense tuft of white 

 threads. Fig. 1 represents a typical case. It shows absolutely no 

 sign of chlorophyll and is full of starch. 



In fig. 2 I have represented what may be regarded as a transi- 

 tion stage. It is also full of starch, but the cell has a faint green- 

 ish tinge. It is impossible to say whether the plant is just regain- 

 ing its chlorophj'll or whether it is just losing it. 




1901.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA.

The condition of a flead cell is represented in fig. 3. Here the 

 protoplasm is contracted, and the starch granules are lumped 

 together in the centre of the cells, in striking contrast to the cise 

 represented in fig. 1. 



Microscopic examination further showed that green threads were 

 interspersed here and there among these white filaments ; one of 

 these is shown in fig. 4, the green color being indicated by shading. 

 I regret not having made the examination sooner, since it would 

 then have been possible, for me to say whether or not the green 

 color is newly acquired. It seems quite probable that some of the 




600 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [NoV. 



threads remained green over the winter, but, being few, they were 

 not noticeable to the naked eye. 



The quantity of starch in the bleached cells varied considerably. 

 The extreme condition, on the one hand, where the cells were 

 quite full of starch, as in fig. 1, is markedly different from the 

 rather starved condition of figs. 5 and 6. In the latter cases the 

 cells are doubtless still alive, but they contain comparatively little 

 starch and great vacuoles. The vacuoles are well brought out on 

 treating the cells with iofline (fig. 6). 



The plant, as a whole, is certainly in a listing and, I believe, 

 actively growing condition, and it looks as though it were regaining 

 its normal activity. Extremes and transitions, as regard the 

 quantity of chlorophyll present, can easily be observed. Com- 

 parisons of figs. 1, 7, 9 and 2 wiU illustrate this point. Fig. 1 

 shows the perfectly bleached cell, figs. 7 and 9 show cells contain- 

 ing a little chlorophyll, while fig. 4 represents the deep green 

 cell, which consists of one large mass of connected chromatophores. 

 Furthermore, such cases as that of fig. 2, which I mentioned above, 

 were to be found where the whole cell was colored, but the green 

 tinge a very faint one. 



The filaments come singly or in groups from basal cells (figs. 8, 

 9 and 10). In many cases these basal cells are green, while the 

 remainder of the filament may be either green or bleached. Fig. 

 9 represents a case where the basal cell is white. 



The normal state of affairs is the following: The vegetative 

 condition finally results in the formation of oogonia. These are 

 the only portions of the plant wliich survive the winter, and are 

 protected from cold and moisture by their thick cell walls.' In 

 this instance the oogonia were not formed, and the foa<l wliich the 

 plant had stored up for this normal function remained in the form 

 of starch. Naturally it will be of interest to find out if the plant 

 will again resume its assimilating activity. It would also be of 

 interest to determine if the plant behave similarly out of doors, 

 which it might well do under the conditions of a mild winter or in 

 protected places. At all events, the fact that the plant continues 

 to live in its present ghostlike condition seems an interesting reve- 

 lation, so far as tlie physiology of alga; is concerned. 



In Leunis' Synojjuis der Botanik^ I found the following state-

ment, which seems of interest in this connection. Of (Edogonium 

 capillare this author says: " It is a form frequent in stagnant waters, 

 and forms when the water disappears a felt-like mass, the so-called 

 'Meteor Papier' (Meteor Paper). Such masses are also found 

 on meadows which have been submerged for some time, the so- 

 called Wieseutuch, Wiesenleder (meadow cloth, meadow leather). 

 The same formations have been repeatedly found on meadows 

 along the River Oder after floods and are called Oder Haut (Oder 

 skin). A piece which was examined in 1736 by Ehrenberg, and 

 one observed by Cohen in 1849, consisted principally of Clado- 

 phora fraeta and diatoms." In commenting on this phenomenon 

 Leunis makes the following statement : " This comparatively rare 

 formation is the result of a number of conditions — appearance of 

 vigorous algoid growth, rapid evaporation of water in consequence 

 of sunshine and high temperature, and a soil which does not long 

 retain its moisture, so that the Confervse are not decomposed." 



The condition described by Leunis resembles the one I have just 

 observed in the fact that in both cases the alga is bleached and not 

 decomposed. It differs from it, however, in the fact that in drying 

 all activity is forced to cease, while the plant under consideration 

 continues its existence in its normal medium ; and it is this, together 

 with the fact that decomposition does not set in, which makes this 

 condition of (Edogonium a very remarkable one.

A NEW SPECIES OF CLAVILITHES FROM THE EOCENE OF TEXAS. 



BY C. W. JOHNSON AND A. V>\ GRABAU. 



Clavilitbes ohamberlaini n- sp- 



The suire of this species is long and slender, as in C. henne- 

 dyanus Harr. , with which the early whorls of the shell agree 

 pretty well. Only a portion of the protoconch has been observed, 

 but it is apparently of the same character as that of the American 

 species of this genus generally, unless more slender than the 

 normal. The spire contains about seven ribbed whorls ; the suture 

 is moderately depressed ; the ribs are swollen near the middle, but 



become obsolete toward the suture; they are at first more than their 

 width apart, but later become broader aud the interspaces corre- 

 spondingly narrower. A subsutural baud occurs, and is quite 

 strongly marked on the later ribbed whorls, indicating a pro- 

 nounced posterior canal at this stage. 



Spirals on the first five whorls, single, coarser in the centre, but 

 becoming finer toward the sutures; interspiral spaces broader than 

 the spirals. Intercalation of secondary spirals begins on the sixth 

 whorl. On the seventh whorl the ribs become broad and ill 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 603 



defined, tending toward obsolescence. Before they have quite dis- 

 appeared, a sutural shelf sloping somewhat outward and bordered by 

 a slightly outward projecting margin appears; this very soon de- 

 velops into a serrated flange. At the same time the whorls become 

 almost smooth, the spirals usually only occurring on the narrowed 

 anterior portion or canal of the body whorl. Ijength of the adult 

 specimen figure 39 mm., diameter 18 mm. 



This is a parallel species to C sealaris Lam. of the Paris Basin 

 (Calcaire Grossier) and C. longicviix Sol. of the London Clays 

 (Barton Beds). Compared with C. humerosus variety texamis 

 Harris it has more ribs on the spire, which are more regular and 

 bulging, stronger spirals and the well-marked serrated flange. It 

 also differs somewhat in outline, the last whorl being broader than 

 the corresponding one of texainis. It differs from its European 

 parallels in many features, chief of which are the protoconch, the 

 long-ribbed spire, the character of the sutural shelf and flange, and 

 other points readily seen on comparison.

Lodel Creek and Skippdck Creek. — Mr. Benjamin Smith 

 Lyman remarked that on October 26, 1901, the Miueralogical 

 and Geological Section of the Academy of Natural Sciences made 

 an excursion to Fisher's quarry, some twenty yards south of Lodel 

 creek (on the U. S. Geological Survey's topographical sheet incor- 

 rectly called Landis brook, which is really the name of the next 

 stream to the north). The quarry is near a small highway bridge, 

 one mile northwest of Grater's ford, on the Perkiomen railroad. 

 The rockbeds of the quarry belong to the American New Red, 

 and, as observed in 1889, at the time of the State Geological Sur- 

 vey, show the following section from above downwards: 



Dark red, rather soft shales, about 5 feet. 



Dark dull red, rather hard, thin-leaved shales, with fossil 

 impressions and calcareous seams, about 4 " 



In all, about 9 " 



The shales are close withiu the upper limit of the beds marked on 

 the State Geological map of Bucks and Montgomery counties as 

 the Lansdale shales. They dip here 13° N. 30i° W. (true 

 bearing). 



The excursion party was so fortunate as to find a large slab of 

 the stone of irregular shape, about five feet long by three feet wide 

 and perhaps five inches thick, that proved to be particularly rich 

 in interestimr impressions. Tlie whole of one side was covered 

 with unusually perfect ripple marks, of about three-quarters of 

 an. inch in amplitude. In spite of the rijiples, somewhat indistinct 

 traces of two Dinosaur tracks, with tliree forward-i)oiuting toes, 

 could be discerned, each track about six inches in extreme length 

 and about three inches in width. Tlie two tracks are in line, and 

 about twenty inches apart, centre to centre, evidently formed by 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 605 



oue animal moving forward. The hinder track seems to have, at 

 a couple of inches in front of it and a little to the right, a small 

 track, as if of the forefoot of the same animal. The forward 

 track is loo near the edge of the slab to have that accompaniment. 

 At twenty inches back of the foremost toe-point of the hinder 

 track there appears at the other edge of the slab to be the toe- 

 point of another track, and a couple of inches in front of it per- 

 haps very indistinct traces of the small forefoot. Other less dis- 

 tinct footmarks can be perceived to the left of this principal line 

 of tracks. 



On liftins up the slab, however, it was found that the other side 

 bad, in the absence of ripple marks, the cast of a number of other 

 Dinosaur tracks of about the same size, aud likewise two or three 

 in succession at the same distance apart, and more distinctly accom- 

 panied by the impression of the small forefoot. In addition there 

 are a number of smaller tracks, about half an inch across, that 

 appear to be the footmarks of Labyriuthodonts. A few other less 

 perfect impressions of ripple marks, raindrops and footmarks were 

 found by the party in other parts of the quarry. 



At the meeting of the Section on October 28, Messrs. Woolmau 

 and Lyman were appointed a Committee to revisit the quarry, and, 

 if possible, send the slab to the Academy for preservation, which 

 was accordingly done on the 2d of November, Mr. Uselma C. 

 Smith kindly aiding in the work. It was found, however, on 

 arriving at the quany, that the ripple marks had in great part 

 been broken ott from the slab by the members of the previous 

 excursion part\', aud the best of the tracks also removed from the 

 other side. Nevertheless, a number of tracks as well as a consid- 

 erable extent of the ripple marks were still left, and the slab was 

 taken. Another slab of equal surface aud like shape was found, 

 and on turning over, proved to be the mate of the other, and to 

 have a complete and perfect cast of the ripple marks, as well as 

 some similar tracks on the other side. The uninjured slab was also 

 taken and sent to the Academy. Mr. Josiah H. Fisher, the 

 owner of the quarry, readily and freely made a gift of the speci- 

 mens, with admirable public spirit. 



A couple of smaller slabs showed very good ripple marking. 

 One of them, of irregular shape, about eleven iuches long by nine 

 wide, and half an inch thick, has, on one side, shallow ripple 

 marks of about two and a half inches in amplitude; and, on the 

 other side, ripple marks of about the same dimensions, but sur- 

 mounted by what seem to be smaller ripple marks of about half 

 an inch in amplitude, or perhaps rillmarks: but may possibly be 

 very confused impressions of Dendrophijcu-^. It appears, how- 

 ever, to be an interesting example of more than usually compli- 

 cated ripple marking. The slab has also very perfect worm tracks, 

 and several sun cracks. At the oriarinal examination of the 




606 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



quarry, iu 1889, all the above-mentioned kiucis of impressions were 

 found, except the Dinosaur tracks ; and, in addition, impressions 

 of a plant were collected that may be a Baiera. 



The excursion party of October 26 also, on the way home, visited 

 a quarry on the roadside, on the southeast side of Skippack creek, 

 about three-eighths of a mile southwest of the main road between 

 Collegeville and Norristown, near a mill across the creek. The 

 quarry is in dark red, hard, shaly saudrock of what is marked on 

 the State Geological map of the two counties as Gwynedd shales, 

 some 900 feet geologically below their top. The dip here is about 

 12° northwesterly. Here a large fossil Cycad leaf was found, 

 about tweuty-oue inches long by eight inches wide. It is expected 

 that this block will also be brought to the Academy. It may be, 

 as Miss Walter suggests, Pterophyllum spntulatum. 



The party theuce proceeded southward to Eagleville, on the top 

 of a hill of the Gwynedd shales. These comparatively hard dark 

 shales all along their outcrop make prominent hills, with the lower 

 lands formed on the southeast of them by the softer and in greater 

 part red, but further south gray, Norristown shales, and on the 

 northwest by the likewise softer and almost universally bright red 

 Lansdale shales, succeeded northward by the harder and in great 

 part greenish or blackish Perkasie shales, again with higher hills, 

 and yet further north by the softer red Poll si own shales. This 

 succession of beds of distinct character, with their outcrop of 

 special topographical character extending throughout the two coun- 

 ties, all conforming uniformly to several variations of structure, 

 with corresponding curves in the strike of the beds and everywhere 

 with correspondence in the dips, and with no evidence whatever of 

 any repetitions of the same sets of beds (except near the great 

 Buckingham Mountain fault), is convincing proof that there is no 

 overthrust fault parallel to the strike that could diminish the 

 apparent total thickness of the beds. Such a fault, indeed, would 

 have to be of wonderful shape, in conformit}' to a somewhat com- 

 plicated folding of the beds. It is, moreover, in the highest degree 

 improbable that such faults, the result of excessive horizontal pres- 

 sure, with beds of great stiftness and cohesion, necessarily causing 

 extremely steep and overturned dips, could occur in a region of 

 gentle dips and mainly soft beds. 



The foot tracks, rinple marks, raindrop impressions and sun 

 cracjcs found at Fisher's (|uarry, the Cycad leaves and the raindrop 

 im()ressions at the Skippack quarry, and other impressions and sun 

 cracks at many other points in the New Red of this region, show 

 clearly that the rocks were laid down in an estuary that was 

 shallow through a great part of the process, if not throughout. 

 There must have been submergence to correspond with the accumu- 

 lating beds, and doubtless caused oy their weight upon this portion 

 of the enrth's crust. As the sedimentary material has plainly 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 607 



come from both sides of the narrow estuary, the accumulated thick- 

 ness of the beds must have been far greater, perhaps six times 

 greater, than it would have been with equally far-reaching and 

 rapid drainage on the single shore of an ocean where the sediments 

 would be carried three times as far from land. This consideration 

 may make belief in the thoroughly demonstrated great thickness of 

 the New Red in Montgomery county a little easier to those, if any 

 there be, who still fondly cling to the old purely conjectural esti- 

 mates.

COCKSCOMB FASCIATION OF PINEAPPLES. 

 BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGEE, PH.D. 



A remarkable case of fasciation, probably one of the most strik- 

 ing of that teratologieal coudition kuowa to botanists, is one 

 recently found by the writer iu the pineapple, Ananassa sativa. 

 The fruit of the pineapple plant is a multiple one, formed from 

 many .spicately arranged flowers and their bracts consolidated into 

 one mass upon a succulent, fleshy axis. Ordinarily, only a single, 

 conical fruit with its tuft of green, sterile, bract leaves is borne at 

 the summit of the plant, surrounded at the base by the large, 

 leathery, awl-poiuted, spirally-arranged, sword-shaped, vegetative 

 leaves. In teratologieal specimens, shipped to Philadelphia from 

 Jamaica and displayed in the windows of prominent fruiterers, 

 several pineapples produced on a single plant were found united 

 by coDgeniral growth into a fan-like mass. One of the most 




h'lO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



striking of these, presented to the writer by Henry Hallowell & 

 Son, was an almost completely open fan, the individual fruits 

 being arranged in a semicircular manner, as shown in the accom- 

 panying figure, reproduced from a photograph of one of the largest 

 fasciated specimens. These fasciated pineapples, known to the 

 trade as " Freak " or " Cockscomb Pineapples," seem to be not 

 at all uncommon. Henry Hallowell & Son had at least a dozen 

 or more specimens, besides the one presented to the writer. The 

 smallest of these consisted of two united pineapples, and the largest 

 (twenty inches across, twelve inches higli) showed the union of a 

 dozen or more. The fasciated fruits in nearly all instances were 

 arranged regularly side by side; in some illustratious, however, 

 one or two fruits crowded out of the fan-shaped mass during growth 

 projected in several directions, so that the combined mass consisted 

 of an irregularly disposed row of united pineapples. A stem, one 

 to two inches in diameter, common to all of the united fruits, was 

 present in all the cases examined. 



Apparently from a count of the more concave, Hat side of the 

 monstrosity shown in the plate, there were ten pineapples united 

 together, as outlined by the deep grooves which ran between them. 

 On the other, more convex face, twelve united masses were 

 discernible, all arising from a common stalk one and a half inches 

 in diameter, with a number of lanceolate, involucral leaves about 

 six to eight inches long at the base of the clustered fruits. A 

 count, however, of the tufts of crown leavas would indicate, if 

 each fruit in the bunch had only one crown tuft, tliat many more 

 fruits than ten or twelve were aggregated together. The coronal 

 tufts of leaves form a; continuous growth over the entire top of 

 the fasciation, as shown in the plate. It was difficult to count 

 the tufts therefore, on account of their massing together, but the 

 mosl careful count possible under the circumstances gave fifty tufts 

 as the result of the enumeration. It seemed hardly likely, how- 

 ever, that the fasciated mass consisted of that many fruits, and to 

 decide the matter a section was made through the monstrosity by 

 means of a saw, and such a section showed twenty distinct upwanl 

 projecting divisions of the fleshy fasciation. "Whether each division 

 represented a fruit, it was not possible to determine by the exam- 

 ination. 



The monstrosity, which hail a pleasant pineapple aroma, was 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. Oil 



succulent, but very fibrous, with many fibres radiating from the 

 common stalk and running to the semicircular summit of the 

 edible mass. The flavor was quite good, although the specimens 

 tried lacked the juiciness of the finer Ripley pines, and reminded 

 one of the taste of the inferior grades of Cowboy pineapples 

 raised in Jamaica and consumed by the negroes of that island. 



The ripened individual flowers of the fasciated pineapples were 

 apparently normal, consisting of the succulent inferior ovary, succu- 

 lent sepals and fleshy base of the subtending bract. The succulent, 

 diamond-shaped floral masses were flattened laterally, or became 

 mere vestigial structures, wherever they had been pressed together 

 by the union of the pineapples of which the monstrosity was com- 

 posed. 



One is tempted to theorize with these unique specimens taken 

 into consideration, for fasciation appears in plants subjected to 

 conditions of nourishment above the normal, occasionally as a result 

 of disease or injury. Did these factors influence the production of 

 fasciated pineapples in Jamaica ? Who can say!

A NEW SPECIES OF OPHIBOLUS FROM WESTERN TEXAS 

 BY ARTHUR ERWIN BROWN. 

 Ophibolus alternus sp. nov. Plate XXXIV. 



Maxillary teeth 13; mandibular 14-15. Body moderately slen- 

 der; bead distinct, muzzle contracted; eye rather large. Rostral 

 low and bi'oad, barely visible from above; interuasals about half 

 the length of prefrontals; frontal a little longer than the suture 

 between parietals, longer than the snout; parietals large, wide in 

 front, narrow behind; nasals 2, the nostril between them; loreal 

 small, longer than high; preocular 1 ; postoeulars, 2 on one side, 3 

 on the other; temporals, 2-3 on one side, 3-4 on the other; upper 

 labials 7, third and fourth in orbit; lower labials 11. Posterior 

 chin shields a little shorter thau the anterior, not separated by 

 scales. Scales smooth, with two inconspicuous pits, in 25 rows. 

 Ventrals 217; anal entire; subcaudals 60 pairs. Total length 710 

 mm. (tail 115). 



The ground color is slate gray, crossed on the back, at intervals 

 of 3 to 5 scales, by bands of black which are alternately wider 

 and narrower, the wide ones covering from 2 to 3 scales on the 

 middle of the back, and more or less divided transversely on their 

 centres with scarlet. The narrow bauds are about one scale wide 

 and wholly black, occasionally broken through by the ground color. 

 On the neck the bands are narrower and less defined, while the red 

 is more pronounced on the posterior part of the body. There are 

 nineteen red and black bands on the body, and an equal number 

 of the intermediate black ones. ( )n the tail there are 5 bands, 

 which form quite distinct rings, on the last two of which the red 

 is absent. The head, including the labials, is dark gray with 

 small dark mottlings, not well defined, and a narrow black streak 

 from the postoeulars to the angle of the mouth. Ventral surface 

 grayish white, heavily blotched with black, into which the black 

 portion of the cross bands runs. 



Type, No. 14,977 Academy Coll. From the Davis Mountains,

The snake here described was received alive at the Zoological

 collector as the lately described Coluber subocularis. In propor- 

 tions and scale formula it comes nearest to 0. zonatus Blain. 

 (= 0. pyrrhomelas Cope), but the head is narrower, the snout 

 more contracted and there are two more rows of scales, while the 

 peculiar disposition of the dorsal cross bands is quite unlike any 

 Ophibolm previously known. The species is perhaps intermediate 

 between 0. zonatus and 0. leorm Gunth. , the type of which came 

 from Nuevo Leon, Mexico.

A fossil form characterized by the thickness of the large shell, 

 the somewhat swollen latter third of the base, which is also swollen

The absence of any trace of angulation around the umbUicu.s, 

 and the small size of the latter, give this race an appearance of 

 distinctness. 



Clansilia daoalis Kobelt, 



This magnificent species was described from a specimen of un- 

 known locality further than the indefinite " interior of Nippon " 

 which served as habitat for Rein's Japanese collection. The type 

 IS described as yellowish horn-colored, and 36 mm. long 8 wide 

 the aperture 9 mm. long. Mr. Hirase has lately sent specimens 

 from Miya-mura, in Hida Province, which agree with ducali, in 

 the brilliant gloss and large apex, but have the last two whorls 

 dark vinaceous-browu, with a yellow sutural border and sprinkled 

 with fine yellow dots; the two next earlier whorls are rather bright 

 yellow, still earlier ones are worn. 



Length 32i to 34i, diam. 8 mm. 



It is a magnificent species. 



At Kiyomi-mura, Hida, an interesting variety occui-s, the 

 shell being longer and narrower, less glossy, the surface more 

 striate, last whorl more cylindric. Color light olivaceous yellow

Shell nearly cylindric, slightly tapering, pale red, composed of 

 4^ whorls, the upper one truncate and plugged. Sculpture of 

 strong, regular, nearly straight ribs, about 20 on the last whorl. 

 There is a high, narrow rib behind the outer and basal lips, and 

 a rounded rib or prominence around the umbilical region. Aper- 

 ture oval; the inner lip covered with a heavy callus.

This is one of the few Old World species of Truncatella in 

 which there is a rib or crest behind the lip. It differs in this 

 respect from T. vu/ida Pfr., which is found in Okinawa or Eiukiu 

 Island. The latter is also larger and has more numerous, smaller 

 nbs.

 wider, with the ribs disappearing on the last whorl. No crest or 

 rib behind the lip is mentioned.

DESCEIPTIONS OF NEW HELICOID LAND SHELLS FROM JAPAN 

 BY G. K. GUDE. 



Chloritis (TricliooMorites) pumila n- sp. 



Shell imperforate, depressed, dark corneous. Spire flat, apex 

 obtuse, suture impressed. Whorls 4|, convex, increasing slowly 

 at first, the last widening rapidly; very densely covered with very 

 short bristles, arranged in oblique rows. Last whorl scarcely 

 descending in front, inflated below. Aperture a little oblique, 

 rounded lunate, peristome thin, straight; margins distant, united 

 by a thin callus on the parietal wall. Columellar margin dilated 

 above, completely covering the umbilicus. 



Diam. maj. 12, minor 10.5; alt. 9 ram. 



Hab. — Mikuriya, Suruga (Hirase, No. 7^5). Type in my 

 collection. 



This makes the third species of Chloritis recorded from Japan. 

 It differs from both C. oscitans and C. fragilis by its smaller 

 size, by the completely covered umbilicus and by the bristles being 

 shorter, staffer and much more crowded. Tn the shape of aperture 

 it is nearest to C. oscitans. 



Enlota (.Egista) mimuloides n sp. 



Shell rather narrowly umbilicated, depressed conoid, ruddy 

 corneous, paler below. Spire depressed, apex obtuse, suture linear. 

 Whorls 5, closely coiled, increasing very slowly, somewhat flat- 

 tened above, rounded below, with a thin deciduous cuticle, which 

 is densely covered with short silky processes, like adnate hairs. 

 The last whorl angulated at the periphery, scarcely descending in 

 front. Aperture oblique, subcircular, peristome not thickened, a 

 little expanded ; margins distant, columellar a little dilated above. 

 Umbilicus rather narrow. 



Diam. 7.5, alt. 4.25 mm. 



Hab.— Itanami, Omi (Hirase, No. 75.3). 



Allied to JEgista mlmula, but it is smaller, the .spire is more 

 depressed, the whorls are more closely coiled, the last is less ample, 

 the umbilicus narrower, and the cuticular processes are more 

 crowded and smaller.

ON THE COMMON BKOWN BATS OF PENINSULAS FLOBIDA AND 

 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 



BY S. N. EHOADS. 



ExaraiuatioQ of a series of skius and skuUs and alcoholic speci- 

 mens of the Florida Brown Bat, in the author's collection and in 

 the museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 

 shows constant racial differences from typical Eptesicus juscnus of 

 Philadelphia county. These differences are similar and in the same 

 degree and direction as those separating the two forms of Red Bat 

 inhabiting the regions named. The Florida race may be distin- 

 guished as follows: 

 Eptesicus fusous osceola subsp. nova. 



Type No. 875, ad. d", in Coll. of S. N. Rhoads. Taken April 

 29, 1892, at Tarpon Springs, Fla., by W. S. Dickinson. 



Description. — Similar in size and cranial characters to fuscus ; 

 colors deeper and darker, being of slightly varying shades of cin- 

 namon brown as contrasted with the bistre and sepia of /ms-cms. 

 This character is uniform in a series of eight dry skins which have 

 never been immersed in a liquid preservative, and is peculiar to 

 them in a comparison with a similar .series of fiftec n topotypes of 



MeasuremenU of type, made by collector from fresh specimen : 

 Total length 101 mm. ; tail 38 mm. ; hind foot 9h mm. Average 

 measurements of four topotypes, 113-44—10.6. 



The skull of type indicates it to be an old adult, quite as large 

 as adult skulls of fmeus, but the measurements given by the 

 collector are less than a normal average. This average corresponds 

 closely with that of ten specimens oijusrus from Sing Sing, N. Y., 

 as given in Miller's monograph of North American Vespertilionida. 



AVhether this subspecies is found outside the limits of })eninsular 

 Florida I am unable to state. As Miller classes the Eptesicux from 

 Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi examined by him under fmcus, 

 I conclude that I', caroliniensis of Geoff roy cannot apply to the 

 Florida race. 




1901. J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. (31^ 



In Miller's monograph, above ciled, all the California Epteskus 

 examined by him are classed under fuscim. A specimen in the 

 author's collection from the San Bernardino Valley, near San Ber- 

 nardino, indicates .a phase of coloration separating it from typical 

 fuseus, in a manner such as might be reasonably predicted by any 

 one having a knowledge of the climatic effect of this locality upon 

 other mammals thus living on the outskirts of the Mojave Desert 

 region. It is quite probable that Mr. Herron collected this .=ipeci- 

 men on his ranch, a few miles west of San Bernardino, or in one 

 of his eastern trips into the edge of the desert. The exact locality 

 is not stated on the label. The specimen may be thus charac- 

 terized: 



Eptesious fuscus bernardinus suljsp. nova. 



Type No. 1,247, ad. c?, Coll. of S. N. Rhoads. Taken by R. 

 B. Herron, May 26, 1893, in the "San Bernardino Valley" 

 (near San Bernardino), Cal. 



Description. — Size and cranial characters as in Eptesieus fuscus 

 typicu-s. 



Color. — Pallid bistre above, brownish drab below; the hairs 

 below being uuicolor nearly to their roots, and those above darken- 

 ing slightly only in the basilar fourth of their length. In fuscrus 

 the upper body hairs are darkly sooty for more than half their 

 basilar length, the brown tips not coucealing the dark under-fur. 

 Wing membranes and ears in bernardinus very dark. 



Measurement-^ of type: Total length 114 mm.; tail 51 mm.; 

 hind foot ?; alar extent 304 mm. These measurements were 

 made by the collector before skinning the specimen. 



A series of four specimens from the same collector taken in 

 the "San Bernardino Mts. " in September, 1893, shows that the 

 mountain form is inseparable from fmcus ; one of these, however, is 

 a perfect intergrade. Bernardinus differs from peninsulce, O. 

 Thomas, from southern Lower California, in its large size ; penin- 

 suloe appearing to be a distinct species.

MYCTOPHUM PHENGODES IN THE NOKTH' ATLANTIC

S-lcopelus] phengodes hutken. Kongel. Uausk. Vidensk. Selsk. Skrift. 

 (K(>benhavn), 6e Rseke, VII (1890-94), 1892. p. 253, fig. 11. 



No. 7,987. From the Atlantic Ocean, in 60° N. Lat., between 

 Greenland and North America. Dr. I. I. Hayes. 



Form of the body of the fish elongate and compressed, and 

 much as in Goode and Bean's figure (No. 84) of Myctophum 

 remiger. The greatest depth of the body is about the pectoral 

 region, and it is contained in the body (excluding caudal) about 

 4 times. 



The head is rather large and about 3f times in the body (with- 

 out caudal ), blunt and compressed. Eyes large and anterior in 

 position, about 2J in the head, and while less than the greatest 

 posterior part of the interorbital region they are larger than the 

 least, or anterior, width of the same. Mouth large, the distal 

 expanded extremity of the maxillary posterior to the eye for nearly 

 the length of the suout, and the mouth-cleft itself occupies ^ the 

 length of the head. Margin of the preoperculum slopes slightly 

 posteriorly and forms a slightly convex curve which bulges poste- 

 riorly. Nostrils directly anterior to the eye and placed laterally 

 upon the blunt snout. Pseudobranchia> large. Gill-rakers long 

 and slender upon the first arch, some longer than the gill-fila- 

 menls. Tongue narrow, knobbed, and free anteriorly. Minute 

 villose teeth upon the jaws. 



Origin of the D. nearer the tip of the snout than the base of 

 the caudal. Base, of D. a little more than -^ the base of the A. 

 Base of last D. ray over the origin of the A. The P. are long 

 and pointed, and with their tips extending nearly to the anus and 

 almost to the medio-lateral photophores. Origin of the V. a little 

 anterior to the origin of the D. and the tips of the fin extending 

 to the origin of the A. Adipose D. a little nearer the base of the 

 caudal than the base of the last D. ray, though the posterior mar- 

 gin of its own posterior moiety is anterior to the base of the last 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 621 



A. ray. The least depth of the caudal peduncle is equal to the 

 anterior interorbital region. 



The photophores are as follows: .3 mandibulars on each side of 

 the mandibles ; 2 operculars near the lower part of the margin of 

 the preoperculum ; 5 thoracic on each side; 4 ventrals on each 

 side; 8 anals, a gap, then 9 more, in all 17 on each side; 3 pec- 

 torals on each side; 1 antero-lateral on each side a little posterior, 

 though above, the bases of the V. , but nearer to the latter than to 

 the lateral line; 3 medio-laterals on each side, forming an oblique 

 series on each side, the lower a little anterior to the last ventral 

 photophores, and the uppermost immediately below the lateral line 

 and in advance of the first anal photophore; a single photophore, 

 the postero-lateral, almost on the lateral line and above and ante- 

 rior to the eighth anal photophore; 2 caudals upon each side inferi- 

 orly, and a single supercaudal at the origin of the rudimentarv 

 caudal rays. The caudal, though somewhat damaged, was forked, 

 the lobes most likely rounded, and the lower a trifle the larger. The 

 lateral line consists of a single well -developed pore on each scale of 

 its course, which is superior, and parallel with the dorsal profile of 

 the back. Scales 42 (?). Radii of D. 12. Radii of A. 22. 



My first impression was to regard this specimen as Myctophum 

 remiger Goode and Bean, but a careful examination has revealed 

 the facts mentioned above ; and if, as Goode and Bean contended, 

 " the arrangement of the luminous spot is of the greatest value 

 in the classification of these fishes," there can be no reasonable 

 doubt that it is Liitken's Scopelus phengodes. 



Although the localities where Liitken obtained his examples were 

 all in southern latitudes, and very remote from that where the 

 present example was taken, I identify it with the above species 

 without any hesitation, as it agrees perfectly with the essential 

 characters given. Specimens from widely remote localities in the 

 case of deep-sea and oceanic fishes do not always necessarily form 

 a barrier to their identity as one and the same species. 



That M. phengodes and 31. remiger are allied is also evident by 

 their long P., the large eye and shape of the head, as seen on com- 

 parison with an example of the latter species. 



The example described above is in the collection of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of PhiladelphiM. It po ssesses a median 

 infero-caudal photophore.

ADDITIONS TO THE JAPANESE LAND SNAIL FAUNA.-V. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The description of Japanese Clausiliidce is resumed ia the present 

 paper. Enough material is now at hand to permit some work 

 looking beyond merely descriptive treatment, wliile every sending 

 from Mr. Hirase adds to the data on one or another of the prob- 

 lems presented by these intricately constructed creatures. I have 

 below considered the evolution of the " lunella," as shown in some 

 newly discovered species of Stereophcedusa, in which young shells 

 show a series of distinct palatal folds, like the European tertiary 

 Clausiliidce and the more primitive forms of Eastern Asia, while 

 old shells have a true lunella. A similar transformation has like- 

 wise been observed in a Megalophcedum just received. The evi- 

 dence indicates that the lunella has been independently acquired, 

 in different phyla, by a process of parallel evolution.

I must again express my deep obligation for material to Mr. Y. 

 Hirase, of Kyoto, Japan. His tireless researches, critical eye for 

 detecting species, and exactness in recording localities are worthy 

 of high commendation. Without these qualities the new and 

 relatively exact literature of Japanese land mollusks would not 

 exist. 



Section HEMIPHiEDUSA Boettger. 



The system of groups set forth by Dr. Boettger in the Clau- 

 sUienstudien, while sufficient at that time, is quite inadequate for 

 the classification of the great number of Chinese and Japanese 

 species now known. For Japanese species my studies lead me to 

 adopt the arrangement offered below. The clausilium in all the 

 groups is rounded or tapering at the end, and not thickened or 

 .only slightly so. 



n. — Inferior lamella spirally ascending within, vi.sible in a front 

 view, receding less deeply than in other Ueiniphcedn.sce ; shell 

 rather large ; superior lamella continuous with the spiral. 

 b. — Interlamellar space corrugated; luuella united to the mid- 

 dle of a lower palatal plica, contiguous to or united with 

 an upper palaial plica near the middle (fig. 2). 

 Clausilium tapering below, recurved and spoutlike at 



the apex Grovp of C. ptychoehila. 



b\ — Interlamellar space smooth; lunelia curving inward above, 

 united below to the middle of the lower palatal plica 

 (figs. 3, 4). Clausilium narrowly tongue-shaped, 



Group of C platyauchen. 

 a'. — Inferior lamella receding, inconspicuous or not visible in a 

 front view. 

 b. — Several palatal plicie; no lunelia (fig. 11), 



Group of C. validiuscula. 

 6\ — A shorter rudimentary lunelia below one or two palatal 

 plicre; no lower palatal plica (figs. 9, 10), 



Group of C. sublunellafa. 

 6^ — A lunelia developed. 



c. — No palatal plicii-; plica principalis subobsolete or 

 wanting; superior lamella separated from the 

 spiral lamella (fig. 5), . Group of C. hyperolia. 

 c\ — Superior continuous with the spiral lamella; principal 

 plica well dev^el'ped ; an upper palatal plica present. 

 Clausilium curved, concave on the inner face. 

 d. — Lunelia bow-shaped (fig. H) or J-shaped (fig. 7), 

 united to the upper palatal plica, curved in- 

 ward below; superior and spiral lamellte united. 

 Group of C. aivajiensU. 




^24 proci;edings of the academy of [Dec, 



d"-. — Lunella slightly curving inward below, not united 

 above with the upper palatal plica (fig. 8). 

 Clausilium rapidly tapering to the mucronate 



apex, Group of C. munus. 



d'. — Lunella straight, joined to the middle of the 



upper and lower palatal plicje, like the letter 



I (fig. 1), . . . Group of C. aulacophora. 



c'. — Superior and spiral lamellse contiguous or separated; 



lunella curving inward below, joining the short 



palatal plica above. Clausilium unusually straight 



and flat, rounded at the apex. Group of C. Pinto. 



A somewhat diSerent sequence of groups would result from using 

 the characters of the clausilium for the primary divisions, but 

 while probably more natural, such an arrangement would be more 

 ■difficult in practical use. The clausilium is variously specialized 

 in the groups of C. ptychochikt, C. munus and C. Pinto, much 

 alike in the other groups. The only species, so far as I know, not 

 provided for in the above key is C. platydera, which belongs with- 

 out doubt to the platyauchen group, but has the receding and 

 straightened inferior lamella of the other division; but there are 

 also some forms partially intermediate between the groups of C. 

 validiiiscula, C. suhlunellata and C. aulaeophora, and further 

 knowledge will doubtless reveal various other intermediate species. 

 The group of C. validiuseula is probably a composite one. 



Group of C. subhmellata. 

 Clausilia serioina var. rhopalia ""v. 



Shell riraate, fusiform, rather obese below, the upper half atten- 

 uated; pale yellow; very finely striate throughout, the sculpture not 

 coarser on the last whorl. Outlines concave above, the apex 

 obtuse. Whorls 10, moderately convex, the last compressed later- 

 ally. Aperture ovate, somewhat oblique; pei'isti^me continuous, 

 white, reile.'ced and thickened, the upper nuirgin in contact with 

 preceding whorl. Superior lamella oblique, marginal, continuous 

 with the spiral lamella wiiich ascends to the middle of the ventral 

 side. Inferior lamella thick and forming a rather conspicuous 

 fold deep in the aperture, straightly ascending within, and pene- 

 trating as far as the spiral lamella. Subcolumollar lamella deeply 

 immersed, terminating about a half whorl within. Principal plica 

 visible deep in the throat, ascending to a lateral position. UpiK?r

This somewhat club-shaped form is noticeable for its fine stria- 

 tion and pale color. The narrow lunella is longer than in other 

 species of the group which I have seen. C. sericina, which has 

 not been figured nor very fully described, seems to be its nearest 

 relative. 



Group of C. aivajiensis. 



This groufj comprises HemiphmduscR in which the lateral or 

 latero-dorsal lunella is J-shaped or bow-shaped, its upper end 

 being united to the middle, or sometimes to the lower end, of a 

 short upper palatal plica, the lower end curving inward. The 

 clausilium is typical of Hemiphcedusa, being parallel-sided, not 

 oblique or thickened at the distal end, and usually it is emarginate 

 ou the columellar side of the filament. 



The species are numerous on Shikoku Island, and will probably 

 prove difficult to limit when more localities are explored and fur- 

 ther slightly differentiated races come to light. Others are known 

 from Awaji, western Nippon and Kiushiu. None have come to 

 my hands from middle or northern Nippon, or from Yesso.

 ascending within the last whorl, and giving off a distinct branch 

 toward the spiral lamella; its spiral portion weak, shorter and 

 much lower than the spiral lamella, reaching inward to a ventra 

 position. Subcolumellar lamella deeply iuiniersed, its lower end 

 barely visible or not visible within the aperture. Principal plica 

 visible in the throat, extending inward a little past a lateral posi-

ing respects: The surface is more coarsely striate; the last whorl 

 does not have a coavex belt above the position of the principal 

 plica, and has more of a swelling; on its latter portion; the spire 

 has one more whorl. It remains to be seen whether intergrades 

 exist between this species from Shikoku and subaurantiaca from 

 the Province of Nagato in western Nippon. They are certainly 

 closely related. 



Group of C. Pinto. 



Small, solid Hemiphoediisa with the clausilium unusually straight 

 and flat, rounded or a little tapering at the apex, abruptly bent 

 near the filament and einarginate or excised on the columellar side 

 thereof. Superior lamella contiguous to or separated from the 

 spiral lamella, which is short, barely reaching the venti'al side. 

 Inferior lamella deeply receding, straightened and strong inside. 



This group has some affinity to Znptijx in both shell and claus- 

 ilium, but it has not the accessory lamella and plica; of that sec- 

 tion. It is not closely related to other Hemiphiedusan groups. 



Two species, from the islands Tane-ga-shima and Yaku-shima, 

 are known: C. Pinto, in which the last whorl is normal, and C. 

 ptijchocipna, which has a wave or crest and several strong wrinkles 

 behind the outer lip.

 about 8, the last without crest or other conspicuous sculpture 

 behind the lip. Aperture small, squarish-ovate, the lip somewhat 

 reflexed, very thick, white, hardly free above. Superior lamella 

 marginal, contiguous to the spiral lamella, which penetrates barelv 

 to the ventral side. Inferior lamella very deeply receding, high 

 and stout within the last whorl, subvertically ascending, a trifle 

 sinuous, extending inward as far as the spiral lamella. Subcolu- 

 mellar lamella emerging. Principal plica less than a half whorl 

 long, extending shortly beyond the lunella. Luuella lateral, 

 straight and joining a short upper palatal plica above, curving well 

 inward and ending in a slisrht nodule below.

Section TYRANNOPH^DUSA Pilsbry. 



Clausilium obliquely truncate distally, the columellar side of the 

 apex slanting, strongly thickened along the inner face. Shell 

 having the superior and spiral lameUse contiguous or separated, 

 the inferior lamella deeply receding, straight or obliquely ascend- 

 ing inside; spiral and columellar lamella usually continued within 

 past the ventral side; lunella united to both upper and lower 

 palatal plica3 or separated from the upper plica, usually latero-ventral 

 or ventral in position. Type C. mikado Pils. 



The characters of this section were only imperfectly perceived 

 when it was originally proposed last year. Further investigation 

 shows it to be quite distinct from Hemiphcedum (which resembles 

 it in the receding inferior lamella), by the oblique and thickened 

 end of the clausilium. Moreover, the lamella3 extend further 

 inward, the closing apparatus retreats more deeply; there is often 

 a crest on the neck parallel to the outer lip, and in some species 

 the lip is plicate in the subcolumellar region, and there may be 

 interlamellar folds. 



The section includes three groups of species, distinguished as 

 follows : 



rt. — A strong crest behind the outer lip. Group of C. ianegashimce. 

 a}. — No distinct crest. 



h. — Lunella curving inward above (concresceut with the outer 

 end of the upper palatal plica), Group of C- bilabrata. 

 ft'. — Lunella straight ; together with the palatal plica? forming 

 an I-shaped barrier, or separated from the upper pala- 

 tal plica, Group of C. mikado. 



Grouj} of C. hilahrata. 



TyranuopbfedusDS of ordinary form, with the clausilium oblique 

 and thickened at the apex, excised on the columellar side of the fila- 

 ment. Superior and spiral lamelke separated or nearly so, the 

 spiral and inferior extending inward to or past the ventral side. 




630 PKOCEEDINOS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



Inferior lamella obliquely or somewhat spirally ascendiug within. 

 Subcoliimellar lamella emerging, usually in a group of lip-folds. 



Lunella ventral or lateral, rather straight above, united below to 

 a lower palatal plica. No upper palatal plica. 



The oblique end of the clausilium, disconnected superior and 

 spiral lamellae, and frequent development of a group of lip-fold* 

 are the chief characters of this group. It differs from the mikado 

 group by the absence of an upper palatal plica and the discontinu- 

 ous superior and spiral lamelhe. The plication of the lip in the 

 region of the inferior and subcolumellar lamellse varies from 

 strongly developed to obsolete in each of the species known 

 among individuals from most localities. 



a. — Peristome notched on the left side of the superior lamella- 

 Shell obese below, the upper, attenuated portion thick, api- 

 cal whorl large; length about 15 mm., . C. surugensis- 

 «'. — Peristome not notched or emarginate near the superior lamella- 

 b. — Early whorls almost always self-amputated in adults. 

 Length 17-25 mm., dependent upon the number of 

 whorls retained, as well as upon the size of the indi- 

 vidual; diam. 4^G mm., . . . . C. hilahrata. 

 I/. — Apex entire; shell slender, acutely tapering above, the 

 first whorl minute; length 12-15, diam. 3-3i^ mm.,

As no good illustration of this .species has appeared, it is figured 

 here for comparison with the two new forms of the same group, 

 and to show the local variations. 



The shell is strong, almost always truncate and j)lugged in 

 adults, 7 to 10 whorls usually remaining. It varies in color from 

 straw-yellow to rather dark brown. It is very finely striate, 

 attenuated above, the last whorl laterally coinpressed. Aperture 

 ovate, the peristome rcflexed and well thickened, very shortly free 

 above, usually but not always corrugated by several or many folds 

 grouped around the subcolumellar lamella. The superior lamella 

 is marginal, rather small, and separated from or sometimes almost 

 continuous with the spiral lamella, which penetrates past the ven- 

 tral side. The inferior lamelhi recedes very deeply, is not visible 




1901.] NATUr.AL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPillA. 631 



from the mouth, except for a slender continual ion across the h'p 

 parallel with the subcolumellar lamella in most specimens, but 

 often wanting. It ascends rather straightly but obliquely inside, 

 and continues inward as far as the spiral lamella. The principal 

 plica is almost a whorl long, approaching the aperture, and con- 

 tinued within past the ventral side. The lunella is latero-ventral 

 or almost ventral, oblique, almost straight, but curved a trifle 

 inward above, and connected with a strong lower palatal plica very 

 near its inner end. 



The clausiliura (PI. XXXVI, fig.«. 20, 21) is parallel -sided, 

 very oblKjuely cut off and thickened on the columellar side of the 

 apex. It is deeply emarginate or excised on the columellar side 

 of the filament. 



I have received specimens from the following localities: Nippon 

 — Kobo, Setsu; Takaya, Bitchu; Toyonishikami, Xagato. 8en- 

 zan, Awaji. Shikoku: Ushirogawa and Okinoshima, Tosa. 

 Kiushiu : Fukuregi and Yatsushiro, Higo. 



The distribution of C. bHabrata includes southwestern Nippon, 

 Awaji and Shikoku Islands, Kiushiu and the Iki Islands; the 

 latter locality on the authority of Dr. (). vou M<illendorff, who 

 records specimens collected by Fruhstorfer. 



While there is some variation from place to place, i do not see 

 grounds for the definition of any races or subspecies, except the 

 variety defined by Boettger, which I have not seen. The degree 

 of plication of the right margin of the peristome is subject to wide 

 individual variation in C. hUabraki, C. Oscariana and C. suru- 

 gensU. 



Specimens from Kobe are pale colored, retain 7i-9 whoris, and 

 either have the right margin plain, except for the emerging inferior 

 and subcolumellar laraellre (fig. 17), or many-folded (fig. 19). 

 They measure between, alt. 22.5, diam. 5.5 mm., whorls^O, and 

 alt. 20, diam. 4.8 mm., whoris 8. At Takaya, Bitchu, the shells 

 are larger, and vary from a single emerging lamella, the subcol- 

 umellar, to three or four folds. Alt. 25, diam. 5.8 mm., whorls 

 8A; alt. 21, diam. 6 mm., wlioris 7i. They are corroded, and 

 more or less clothed with green algse on the back (figs. 23, 24). 



Toyonishikami, Xagato. Dark reddish-brown, with the lunella 

 decidedly ;afe)o-ventral, and the principal plica shorter; lip with 

 numerous folds. Alt. 23.5, diam. 5.6 ram., whoris 9+. 




632 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



Senzan, Awaji. Like Kobe shells, but sometimes smaller. Alt. 

 20, diam. 5 mm., whorls 8; alt. 17, diam. 4.5 mm., whorls 7i. 



Okiuoshima, Tosa. Specimens like tho.se from Kobe, but the 

 lip is sometimes appressed, not free above, and the superior lamella 

 scarcely marginal. Plication of the subcolumellar region variable. 



Ushirogawa, Tosa. Slightly smaller than Kobe shells and, like 

 the preceding lot, more opaque, the lunella not visible from the 

 outside. 



One specimen, sent at a difierent time from this locality (PI. 

 XXXVI, fig. 22), retains the apex perfect, is reddish-brown, 

 slightly translucent, and has a much shorter principal plica, ex- 

 tending but a short distance beyond the lunella. There are 18 

 whorls, the earlier ones translucent-white. Length 25.5, diam. 

 5.9 mm. 



Fukuregi, Higo, Kiushiu. Kather small, with few or many 

 subcolumellar plications. Alt. 19, diam. 5 mm., whorls 9. 



Yatsushiro, Higo. Larger than the preceding; peristome often 

 somewhat more solute than in Kobd shells, and the mouth a little 

 narrower. Alt. 2.4, diam. 5 mm., whorls 10^; alt. 21, diam. 

 5 mm., whorls 8 J.

 three or four scarcely increasing in diameter, the last two or three 

 whorls quite swollen. Aperture piriform with rather distinct 

 sinulus, peristome narrowly reflexed and thickened, varying from 

 nearly smooth to densely plicate along the columellar margin ; 

 notched to the left of the superior lamella. Superior lamella rather 

 small, a more or less distinct groove on each side of it, and a very 

 small fold or lamella close to it on the left; not continuous with the 

 spiral lamella, the latter continued inward past the ventral side. 

 Inferior lamella very deeply receding, strongly spiral within, con- 

 tinuing inward as far as the spiral lamella. Subcolumellar lamella 

 emerging. Principal plica a half whorl long, extending from a

subcoliimellar lamella aud sharper, higher crest behind the outer 

 lip. C oxycyma scarcely differs from tanegashimce externally 

 except in its smaller size, but it has a well developed upper palatal 

 plica, which is represented in tanegashimw by only a short inward 

 bend of the lunella. The palatal margin of the clausilium is 

 straight in C. tanegashimce. 



Specimens from Yaku-shima agree with those of Taue-ga-shima 

 in solidity and size. The lunella is low above and its inward bend 

 above, though low, is rather pliciform. I did not receive these 

 specimens until recently, or I wouhl have named the species 

 differently, since it proves to extend beyond Tane-ga-shima. 



Group of C. mikado. 



This group is well developed in the provinces about the upper 

 (eastern) end of the Inland Sea. Probabh' C. plicilahris A. 

 Ad., described from Tanabe, Kii, will prove to belong here, near 

 C. aurantlaca and the following species. I formerly thought it 

 might be identical with C. lilabrata Smith. 



Clausilia orthatraota n. sp. Pl, XXXVII, figs. 41. V\ 46. 



Shell rimate, slenderly and straightly fusiform, rather solid, of 

 a pale brown tint. Surface lusterless, finely striate, the striae per- 

 ceptibly coarser, though still fine and close, on the latter part of 

 the last whorl. The upper whorls are almost smooth from wear in 

 the specimens seen. Spire nearly straight-sided, attenuated and 

 nearly cylindric above, the ape.x rather large. Whorls 12, the 

 earlier convex, the later ones Hatteued, last whorl compressed later- 

 ally, noticeably constricted behind the lip, especially near and at 

 the base; and there is generally a stronger riblet where the expan- 

 sion of the lip begins (fig. 4.5). Aperture oblicpie, retracted at 

 the base and sinulus, piriform ami small. The peristome is con- 

 tinuous and stands forward free from the preceding whorl ; is white, 

 thickened, expanded and refiexed, weakly eraarginate at the jjosi- 

 tion of the superior lamella or not noticeably so. Superior lamella 

 marginal, oblique, continuous with ttie spiral lamella, which is low 

 at first, but rises high in the region of the closing apparatus, and 

 penetrates inward past the aperture to a lateral position on the 

 left side. The inferior lamella recede-* deeply, though the lower 

 end continues to the lip-edge. It is straightened within, and pene-

(rates nearly or quite as deeply as the spiral lamella. The suij- 

 columellar lamella emerges to the lip-edge, is bounded by grooves, 

 and there is sometimes some weak crenation of the lip below it. 

 The principal plica approaches the lip, and is about one whorl 

 long. The narrow, straight lunella stands in a veutro-lateral 

 position, and is connected above and below with short but higher 

 upper and lower palatal plicae (fig. 46).

 is oblique and strongly thickened, as usual.

Section STEREOPH^EDUS.V Bttg. 



This section comprises four groups of species: The group of C. 

 valida, restricted to the middle Riukiu Islands;' the group of C. 

 japonica, known from Nippon and Shikoku; the group of C 

 brevior, now known from Nippon, Kiushiu and the Riukiu Islands, 

 and the group of C. entospiiri, containing a single species fnmi 

 Tane-ga-shima. 



The group of C. japonica includes the following large species : 

 1. C. japonica Crosse. Synonyms of the typical form are C. 

 koheiwU Smith and C. nipponensis Kobelt. There cannot 

 be much doubt that C ewystoma v. Mart, is a pathologic 

 individual of the same. 



A var. pallens has been distinguished by von MoUendorfi, 

 and I have defined var. interplicata. There remain several 

 other more or less well-marked races, which it seems to me 

 inadvisable to name until their distribution can be more fully 

 studied. In Idzumo Province a large, dark race occurs, which

agrees with C. Hilgendorfi v. Mart, in everythiu? except 

 the sutural plica which is said to characterize that species. 



2. C. Hilgendorfi v. ]\Iart. Probably a subspecies of C. japonicu. 



3. C. oostoma v. Moll. I have considered my C. japonica var. 



suruga to be this species. The latter has a synonym, C~ 

 eiirystoma subsp. bruchyptychia Mlldfi. 



4. C. subjaponica Pils. 



The group of C. brevior consists of smaller species, of which the 

 first two, from the middle part of Nippon, have uo lunella, while 

 in C. Steariisil, Addisoiii, Jaeobiaita and hondami a lunella is 

 developed, at least in some individuals.

6. C. nikkoensiH MUdff. 



7. C. hondana Pils. 



8. C Stearnsii Pils. 



9. C. Jaeobiana Pils. 



10. C. Addisoni Pils. 



11. C. gtereoma Pils. with varieties niigax and cogiiata. 



I have elsewhere described and figured C hondana and C. 

 Ste(t,rnsiL C. nikL-oen^U I have not yet seen. The other species of 

 the brevior group are described below. 



In the typical Stereopho'dH^iE there are either several palatal 

 pllcffi, or only the upper and lower. lu C. hondana, Addisoni, 

 Stearnsii, Jaeobiana and stereoma a low, straight lunella stands 

 between the upper and lower plic;e. This lunella, in fully adult 

 individuals, is a smooth ridge, without higher points or irregulari- 

 ties; but in some individuals, viewed from the outside, a row of 

 short light markings is seen, as though a series of palatal plicae 

 stood in place of the lunella. When this is not obvious from the 

 outside, it appears when the shell-wall and lunella are viewed by 

 transmitted light. This indicates local diSeronces in the substance 

 of the shell, affecting its refracting qualities; and it occurred to 

 me that a row of plicie is first formed, and subsequently the spaces 

 between them are filled in. Upon examining specimens of C. 

 Jaeobiana not quite mature, iu which the peristome was not fully 

 formed, I found that this was what actually takes place. Such 

 shells have no lunella whatever, but in its place a series of four or 

 five short plic;e (PI. XXXIX, fig. 68). 



These facts indicate that the ancestral Sifreophcedusa had a 




1901] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 639 



palatal armature of short palatal plicffi, precisely similar to the 

 structure still extant iu certain other groups, Megalophcedma for 

 instance. This became moditiefl in two modes: (1) The interme- 

 diate plicre degenerated, resulting in such forms as typical C. 

 Japonica, in which only the upper and lower plica; remain, or (2) 

 the intermediate plic:e coalesced to form a luuella. 



That the loss of an even series of plicre has been a very recent 

 one in Stereophaedum is indicated by several facts. In species 

 which normally have but two palatal plicre sometimes individuals 

 or races occur in which small intermediate plicre are developed ;'' 

 and in species with a hinella, the earlier structure of a row of 

 plicre is perfectly developed in the stage of growth immediately 

 preceding the adult stage. 



Incidentally I may observe that the perplexing structural varia- 

 tion I formerly recorded in describing C. humlaaa is at least par- 

 tially explained by what I find to occur in the Stereophcediisce of 

 Kiushiu and Tane-ga-shiraa. T was dealing with a small series of 

 siiells, part of which were not absolutelv mature.

This species is not recognizably figured in KobelL's work. For 

 the purpose of more exact comparison with C. Addisoni, a fuller 

 account of the species than has been published is given below. 



The shell is thin, obesely fusiform, much attenuated and cou- 

 cave-sided near the apex, the last three whorls inflated, the last 

 half of the last whorl more or less compressed, often conspicuously 

 narrower than the preceding whorl, as iu the " nipponensis" form 

 of C. japonica. Pale yellowish brown; sharply, very obliquely 

 striate or rib-striate. Whorls about 9i, the apex minute, but the 

 following whorl disproportionately large; next few whorls very 

 slowly increasing. Aperture squarish-ovate, the peristome ex- 

 panded, somewhat reflexed, thickened and white, hardly free 

 above, the upper margin parallel to the sutures. Superior lamella 

 thin and high, marginal, continuous with the spiral lamella which 



' The evidence of this will be presented in a f utnre jjaper dealing with the 

 C japonica group of Stereophadusa. 




640 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADE.MV OF [DeC. , 



penetrates to or past the middle of the ventral side. Inferior 

 lamella approaching the superior, forming a strong, subhorizontal 

 fold; inside it ascends with a broad spiral trend, and penetrates 

 nearly or quite as far as the superior lamella. The subcolumellar 

 lamella emerges to the lip-edge. The principal plica is visible 

 deep iu the throat and ascends to a latero-ventral position. Pala- 

 tal plicje three or four, the first and fourth long, oblique ; the 

 second shorter; third very small or wanting, leaving a space.

 Schmacker); Tokyo (F. Stearns); Nikko, Shimotsuke (Loomis); 

 Fujisawa (Hungerford, type locality of C. telraptyx); Numazu, 

 Suruga (Hirase). 



The small size for a Stereophcedusa, strongly attenuated early 

 whorls, and thin shell are the more prominent differences between 

 C. hrevior and other species of the group. 



The area of distribution so far indicated is a rather restricted 

 district in middle Nippon. ]\Ir. Hirase's fruitful researches in the 

 southwestern half of Nippon and iu Shikoku have not revealed the 

 species there; nor has it yet appeared from as far north as the 

 Province Uzen, whence a considerable number of small species 

 have been sent. It seems to be a very abundant shell in the region 

 ai)out Tokyo Bay. 



The variety tetraptijx Mlldtf. is a little darker brown, the peri- 

 stome brown-tinted, at least in part, the palatal plicie slightly 

 longer than in typical hrevior ; but in the lot of some hundreds of 

 specimens I have seen, these characters, except as to the tint of the 

 lip, vary by insensible degrees, so that I do not see that ttlrnptyx 

 has a valid claim to varietal distinction. One of the original

 continued to the lip-edge. The three palatal plicc^ are slightly 

 shorter than in C. brevior, and there is a very low, subobsolete, 

 straight luuella, or at least a low callous deposit between the second 

 and the lowest plica?, and connected with the latter.

 Kagoshima Bay (Addis(m Gulick) ; Kagoshima and Kajima, 

 Satsuma (Mr. Hirase); Isshochi, Higo (Hirase); all in soutnern 

 Kiushiu. 



This form is very much like C. brevior, of which I at first con- 

 sidered it a variety. It is slightly stronger, larger than any but 

 the largest specimens of brevior, and diflers iu having a callous 

 pad or rudimentary lunella above the lower palatal fold, and in 

 the decidedly coarser striation. The clausilium is thicker at the 

 apex, and the palatal side is more convex (figs. 54, 55). 



Geographically it is very widely separated from all parts of the 

 range of C. brevior; and as Mr. Hirase has not found either 

 species at any of the multitude of intermediate localities explored 

 by him or his collectors, it seems unlikely that there are any con- 

 necting forms in the intermediate territory— the southwestern half 

 of Nippon and northern Kiushiu. 



It is named in compliment to Mr. Addison Gulick, formerly of 

 Osaka.

swollen, latter half of the last whorl compressed. Surface glossy, 

 sculptured with strong, threadlike oblique striie, 3 or 4 earlier 

 whorls smooth, usually worn or eroded. Whorls 9 to 9^^, quite 

 convex, and separated by deeply impressed sutures. Aperture 

 slighdy oblique, ovate-piriform, the peristome very shortly free 

 above, expanded and reflexed, whitish, slightly emarginate at the 

 position of the superior lamella, the sinulus a little retracted. 

 Superior lamella slender, vertical, continuous with the spiral 

 lamella, which extends inward to the middle of the ventral side. 

 Inferior lamella forming a rather small but subhorizontal fold, not 

 reaching out upon the lip, exteudiug inward as far as the superior 

 lamella. Subcoluraellar lamella varying from barely immersed to 

 rather weakly emerging. Principal plica a half-whorl long, ex- 

 tending from a dorsal position (visible deep in the throat) to a 

 latero-ventral position. Upper and lower palatal plicae rather 

 short, lateral. Below the upper palatal plica there is a delicate 

 second plica, from the outer end of which a low straight luuella 

 runs to the lower palatal plica. 



Length 15.5, diam. .3.6 mm. ; length 13.6, diam. 3.5 mm. 



The clausilium (PI. XXXIII, figs. 61, 62) has the general 

 shape and curvature of that of C. hrevior and Addisoni, but differs 

 from both in having the apex more pointed, and it is more concave 

 on the palatal side of the apex. The end is also more thickened 

 than in C. brevior.

This species is related to C Stearnsii Pils. of Okinawa and ('. 

 Addisoni Pils. of southern Kiushiu. It is much more slender than 

 the latter, with more convex whorls and a more pointed clausilium. 

 C. Stearnsii is a longer species, in which the early whorls are not so 

 attenuated. These three species have a low and more or less well- 

 developed lunella when adult, a structure occurring also in some 

 s|)ecimens of C. hondana, but otherwise unknown in the 5<ereo/j/ia;- 

 dusce of Nippon. In immature shells a row of short palatal plicte 

 stands iu place of the lunella (fig. 68). 



This Claitsilia has the tliin shell of the other species of the 

 brevior group, while all other Cluuiiiue known from Tanc-ga- 

 shimn are extremely thick and strong.

It is named in honor of Dr. Arnold Jacobi, author of excellent 

 papers upon the soft anatomy of Japanese snails, the faunal rela- 

 tionships of Japan, etc. 



The specimens from Yaku-shima are more solid than those from 

 Tane-ga-shima, and the palatal armature seems to be less devel- 

 oped, the lunella being less distinct or absent. There are three 

 palatal plicte below the principal plica, the first, second and lowest. 

 The sculpture and shape are not noticeably different, the largest 

 and smallest sent measuring :

A few examples were with the specimens of C. Pinto. Mr. 

 Hirase remarks that it is very rare. It is an excessively peculiar 

 species, and I was formerly at a los.s a.s to its affinities. The broadly 

 spiral trend of the inferior lamella, which is moreover very short 

 within, the weak, short spiral lamella and principal plica and the 

 peculiar lunelhi are a cimbiuatiou of features unlike any Oriental 

 species known to me. The squarish lower end of the inferior lamella 

 is sometimes visible in a front view (fig. 74), but in other speci- 

 mens it recedes, and is seen only in oblique view (figs. 72, 73). 

 The clausilium is quite unlike that of any other known Japanese 

 species. The lunella might almost as well bo considered a oreatly

developed lower palatal plica, as it is no doubt iu part homologous 

 Avitli that. 



The shell is excessively solid and thict, stronger in fact than any 

 other species of such diminutive stature known tome; but unusual 

 solidity is a characteristic of the Clausilia' of Tane-ga-shima and 

 Yaku-shima, common to the Stereophcediisce, Heiniphcedusce and 

 TyrannopJuvdusfp alike, and clearly to be correllated with some 

 factor iu the environment acting upon the entire series.

CATALOGUE OF THE CLAUSILIIDiE OF THE JAPANESE EMPIRE.' 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The general sequence of species in the following list is from 

 primitive to specialized forms; but this end is only imperfectly 

 attained, as there are several highly specialized groups termiuatiug 

 wholly independent phyla, making a serial arrangement quite 

 arbitrary. The forms with narrow clausilium and several palatal 

 plicEe in place of a kinella are the more primitive, retaining the 

 structure of early Tertiary groups. Megalophcedusa and the typi- 

 cal Hem ipkccd usee are of this kind. Zaptijx, Luchupluedum and 

 Tyrannophcedusa seem to be three independent specializations from 

 an early Hemiphaidusan stock. Stereophccdma stands a little more 

 remote; while Pseudonenia, Eupha-dusa and Rcinia probably 

 separated from the pro-Hemipha3dusan stock at a still earlier period. 



The East Asiatic Clausiliidip are much more closely related to 

 early Tertiary than to modern European groups. The evidence 

 indicates that, like the Belogonous Helicida; a common stock of 

 Clausiliidic spread over Asia and Europe, at least as early as the 

 Eocene. Subsequent evolution has been along independent lines 

 in the East and the West; and just as I have demonstrated in the 

 Helicida', the European stock has forged ahead, while the Oriental 

 looks backward, many a group retaining old characters. 



Ninety-three well-established species of Claimilia are now known 

 from Japan, more than half of them first described in this journal. 

 Of this number forty-four were brought to light by Mr. Hirase. 

 The localities of many others, previously uncertain, have been 

 ascertained from specimens collected by him. In addition to these 

 species, thirty-five subspecies or varieties have been described. 

 The list of species is encumbered with eleven additional specific 

 names, standing for forms so inadequately described that their rela- 

 tionships with other species are not ascertainable from published 



' Exclusive of Formosa.

ZYGEUPOLIA LITORALIS, A NEW HETERONEMERTEAN.' 

 BY CAROLINE BURLING THOMPSON, PH.D. 



I. Introduction. 



At the end of August, 1899, four specimens of Zygeupolia litor- 

 alis were discovered by the writer at Wood's Hole, Mass. The 

 following summer the worms were found in great abundance in the 

 same locality, and from fifty to one hundred specimens were 

 obtained. 



The work on this paper has been mostly done in the Zoological 

 Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania, under the direction 

 of Prof. E. G. Conklin and Asst. Prof. T. H. Montgomery, Jr., 

 and it is a pleasure to express my thanks to both for their interest 



' Contribution from the Zoological Laboratory of the University of 

 Pennsylvania.

and generous assistance. To Dr. Montgomery, who has more di- 

 rectly supervised my work and kindl)' helped me in many ways, I 

 am especially grateful. I would also thank Dr. C. O. Wlutman for 

 the courtesies extended me at the Marine Biological Laboratory at 

 Wood's Hole, and I am indebted to Dr. Wesley R. Coe for many 

 kindnesses. 



Methods. — Owing to the great contractility of the Nemerteans, 

 it is best to use some stupefying agent before fixation, otherwise 

 the specimen becomes so twisted that it is unfavorable for section- 

 ing. After removing the slime sheaths with a needle, the worms 

 were usually placed in a shallow dish of sea-water, and crystals of 

 magnesium sulphate were slowly added. If dropped in too quickly 

 they will irritate the worms and fragmentation will occur. In this 

 solution the worms were left until they ceased to respond when 

 touched, the . time varying from one and a half to three hours, 

 according to the amount of the sulphate. When the worms were 

 sufficiently relaxed the water was drawn otf, and the killing fluid 

 added; or they were lifted out of the water with brushes and 

 placed in the fixative. 



The fixatives used are (1) corrosive sublimate, a conceutrated 

 solution in fifty per cent, alcohol, for thirty minutes ; an excellent 

 general fixative, and one that has been extensively used ia this 

 work. (2) Gilson's mercuro-uitric mixture, formula according 

 to Lee (1896), for about half an hour; to be highly recom- 

 mended, especially for the structure of gland cells and connective 

 tissue. (3) Flemming's fluid (chromo-aceto-osmic acid), for 

 twenty-four to sixty hours; especially good for nerve tissue and 

 cilia. (4) Flemming's fluid (stronger mixture), for forty-eight 

 hours, followed by pyroligneous acid fur twenty-four hours. After 

 employing this method the material may be sectioned aud mounted 

 without staining. It is excellent for tracing nerves, and for the 

 gross anatomy of most parts, but it is not adapted for histological 

 or cytological details, except for cilia. Specimens fixed in this way 

 may afterward be stained with iron-hjematoxylin, but the results 

 are not so good as when Flemming's fluid alone is used. (5) 

 Ninety-five per cent, alcohol ; a good fixative, except for the body 

 epithelium. 



The stains used are Ehrlich's hicmatoxylin, undiluted, fifteen 

 minutes to one hour, washed with alcohol containing a few drops 




1901.] NATUKAI. SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 659 



of ammonia and followed by eosin in concentrated aqueous solu- 

 tion, three to five minutes. This is the stain that has been most used, 

 and is a very satisfactory one. The longer time in hfematoxylin 

 is best for nerve fibrous tissue and epithelial structures. The 

 Biondi-Ehrlich mixture, three hours, has been employed, but is 

 not very satisfactory except for connective tissue. The iron- 

 hrematoxyliu method together with Bordeaux red is an excellent 

 stain after a Flemming fixation, and the Hermann triple stain — 

 saffroniu twenty-four hours, gentian violet six minutes, iodine 

 three hours — has also been used. 



Habitat. — Zygeupolia was found at Wood's Hole, in a sandy 

 beach of limited extent, bordering on a little arm of Buzzard's Bay 

 that is separated from the main bay by the point of land known 

 as Penzance. Here, just in the angle made by the bay shore and 

 Penzance, the sand has drifted in, replacing the usual stony or peb- 

 bly beach ; and in this small area, which is uncovered at low tide, 

 are found, together with many other marine worms, especially 

 Annelids, several genera and species of Nemerteans. Both Cere- 

 bratulus leidyi Yen. and C. lacteus Verr. occur there, but the 

 latter not abundantly; Micrura ccecaVerr. , Cephalothrix linearis 

 Oers. and Carinoma tremaphoros Thomp. With such a rich supply 

 of material in a spot very convenient to the Marine Biological 

 Laboratory, it seemed unprofitable at that time to work over any 

 other localities, so I am unable to say anything in regard to the 

 distribution of Zyfjeupolia. Dr. Coe found this genus last sum- 

 mer in (Juisset Harbor, about two miles farther north on Buzzard's 

 Bay, in a very similar habitat. 



When the sand, either above or below the low-water mark, is 

 turned over, Zi/geupolia may be found, usually about a foot below 

 the surface. The turning up of the sand frequently breaks the 

 worm, but a number of perfect specimens have been preserved. 



The Living Worm. — In life the worms vary considerably in 

 length, chiefly owing to different states of contraction, so that it is 

 difficult to say accurately what the true length is. The same worm 

 seems to have two normal states, beside that of actual contraction. 

 The first is that of comparative rest, seen in PI. XL, figs. 5, 

 6, which are sketches from living worms. In this condition; as 

 when lying undisturbed in a dish of water, the average length is 

 from 6-8 cm. But when in motion, crawling along the sides of 

 the dish, the worm becomes greatly extended, so that the indi- 




660 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



vidiial that iu rest measured 6-8 em. may uow he 10-12 cm. or 

 longer. 



A change in color accompanies the elongation. At rest 

 the body has a decidedly pink color ; in extension the body is more 

 transparent and dull brownish. This may be seen by comparing 

 the extended worm in fig. 4 with figs. 5 and 6. As the pink color 

 is most pronounced in the contracted condition, becomes less so at 

 rest and disappears iu extension, it is probably due to muscular 

 contraction. The width varies in different specimens from 

 1^3 mm. ; it also varies in the same specimen according to the 

 state of contraction. 



Iu the living worm, PI. XL, figs. 4, 5, 6, four different re- 

 gions may be distinguished: (1) the head, (2) the anterior part 

 of the body, (3) the posterior part of the body, and (4) the 

 caudicle. 



The head is about 6 mm. long, not separated from the body, 

 pure white and tapering to a very fine point. There are no lateral 

 slits, the ciliated pits of the cerebral organs opening directly to the 

 exterior. The mouth is a very small round opening on the ven- 

 tral surface. The shape and color of the head, together with the 

 absence of lateral slits, are good criteria for determining the genus. 



The anterior part of the body is the region extending from the 

 mouth to the beginning of the lobed middle intestine. The length 

 is from 1^3J cm. , and the color varies from pale yellow to pink- 

 ish. It is rounded aud more or less swollen, owing to the presence 

 there of the greater part of the proboscis. 



The posterior part of the body is the most extensive. It is 

 somewhat flattened iu life but is always rounded in preserved speci- 

 mens. The color varies from rose color to pale yellow, light 

 browu and chocolate brown. A pinkish median line on the dorsal 

 surface represents the rhynchocwl ; the alternating cross lines of 

 light aud dark on each side of the median line, fig. 5, are the 

 gonads and intestinal cteca respectively. 



A series of observations were made to ascertain if there are 

 any appreciable color variations corresponding with .sexual ma- 

 turity or diflerence of sex. The conclusions reached are (1) that 

 there is no difference in the color of sexually mature and immature 

 individuals, except that the increased size of the gonads in the 

 mature specimen causes the cross lines mentioned above to be more 

 pronounced; (2) that the general color of the body is the same for 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 661 



males and females; (3) that the color of the intesdnal caeca is de- 

 pendent upon the amount and character of the food contents. The 

 intestine in freshly taken worms is much darker in color than in 

 specimens that have been kept in an aquarium for several days 

 without food. 



The caudicle in life appears as a slender white thread at the 

 posterior end of the body, figs. 4, 5, 6. It is usually much 

 twisted and is easily bi'oken off. It should be mentioned here that 

 in none of the four specimens that were first obtained in 1899 was 

 the caudicle preserved, so that the presence of this appendage is 

 not mentioned in my preliminary note, Thompson (1900 a). 



The white spots in the posterior part of the worm, slightly exag- 

 gerated in fig. 6, are parasites and will be described under that 

 heading. 



On account of its transparency the living worm is a most favor- 

 able and interesting object for study with the low powers of the 

 microscope. It should first be slightly stupefied to prevent exces- 

 sive movements and contractions, so that when it is placed on the 

 slide with a few drops of sea-water and covered, the muscles 

 relax and it lies quietly there, fully extended. With a magnifica- 

 tion of about 70 diameters, it is possible to study the brain lobes and 

 commissures, the cerebral organs, the blood vessels of the head, 

 the proboscis and rhynchodteum, the alimentary system and the 

 gonads. In only two cases could the nephridia be distinguished, 

 but nothing was determined as to their structure. Several attempts 

 were made to study the worm by treatment with methylen blue, 

 after the method of Biirger (1891, p. 327, footnote), but without 

 success. 



The results obtained from the study of the organs in life will be 

 incorporated in the several sections relating to the different organ 

 systems. 



II. Anatomy. 



Body "Wall.— a. Body Epithelium. — The body epithelium, fig. 

 2, is a high one-celled layer, consisting of ciliated supporting cells, 

 S.C, and gland cells, GL^, Gl.,, resting upon abasement layer, 

 B.L. Interstitial connective tissue cells are always present in 

 varying numbers between the bases of the epithelial elements. 



The supporting cells, fig. 14, are about .035 mm. in height, 




662 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



broad at the free distal euds where the cilia are borne, and taper- 

 ing proximally to a slender stalk, sf., which constitutes about two- 

 thirds of the length. In fig. 15, drawn from a sublimate prepara- 

 tion, the stalk is somewhat shrunken and appears less than half 

 the length of the expanded distal part; in fig. 14, a Flemming's 

 fluid preparation, the stalks are relatively longer, and probably 

 more as they appear iu life. The oval nucleus, N., lies in the 

 tapering part of the cell, just above the stalk. The chromatin 

 forms a prominent reticulum. 



The cilia, CiL, are about as long as the expanded distal part of 

 the cell. Each cilium is composed of several parts. The basal 

 knob, fig. 14, b.k., rests on the distal surface of the cell, and is 

 connected by a fine thread with a second smaller granule, the 

 upper knob, u. k., which bears the terminal hair of the eihum. 

 The cilium is continued into the cytoplasm by a line of very fine 

 granules, fig. 14, x., which seem to reach the nucleus. This, 

 however, can only be seen with a verj' high magnification. 



The gland cells are abundant in the body epithehum, and are 

 uniformly distributed throughout the body. Two types may be 

 distinguished, in the first the secretion stains with eosiu, fig. 2, 

 Gl.j, in the second with hsematoxylin, fig. 2, GL... In both types 

 a delicate cell membrane is present, the nucleus is small and lies at 

 the base of the cell embedded in cytoplasm. The relative amounts 

 of cytoplasm and secretion depend upon the phase of the cell. 

 In fig. 2 the blue-staining cell on the left contains less secretion 

 and more cytoplasm, and is therefore in an earlier phase than the 

 blue-staining cell to the right. In like manner, the red-staiuing 

 cell on the right of the figure contains less secretion and is in an 

 earlier stage than the red -staining cell on the left. The red -staining 

 secretion is homogeneous, e^ndently fluid or viscous ; the blue- 

 staining secretion apparent!}' contains flaky masses within a fluid. 

 The latter cells are more apt to assume the flask-like shape, the 

 former are oftener rod-shaped. Cells are frequently found with 

 the secretion entirely discharged from the delicate cell membrane, 

 the nucleus remaining at the base. 



The basement layer, fig. 2, B.L., separates the epithelial cells 

 from the underlying musculature. It is not a true basement mem- 

 brane, being not the product of the bases of the epithelial cells, 

 but a formation from the interlacing fibres of connective tissue

cells. The nuclei of the component connective tissue cells are seen 

 with difficulty, but occur here ami there embedded in the fibres. 

 With a low jjower the basement layer has a homogeneous, rather 

 gelatinous appearance, but with higher magnification its true fibrou.s 

 structure is seen. The average height of the basement layer in the 

 head region is about .006 mm., but it is not a layer of uniform 

 thickness, for its outer surface is thrown into a series of small eleva- 

 tions and depressions. The ridges on the surface bear the stalks 

 of the supporting cells, while the gland cells are inserted into the 

 pits or depressions. The basement layer does not stain with 

 hsematoxylin-eosin, but takes a faint pink with the Biondi-Ehrlich 

 stain. 



An epithelial musculature of circular muscle fibres, fig. 2, 

 Ep.m., Is present immediately beneath the basement layer. It is 

 especially well developed in the head region, consisting of a num- 

 ber of fibres like those of the body wall. Posterior to the ojsopha- 

 geal region the epithelial muscle layer becomes very thin and finally 

 disappears, but reappears at the posterior end of the body. 



b. The Cutis.— The cutis is defined by Biirger (1895) as the 

 subepithelial glandular layer, usually containing numerous muscle 

 fibres, which is found in the Heteronemerteans. 



In Zygeupolia any distinction between the outer longitudinal 

 muscle layer and the cutis would be merely an artificial one. The 

 fibres of the outer longitudinal muscle layer extend fi-om the cir- 

 cular layer out to the epithelium of the body wall, and although 

 subepithelial gland cells are present, frequently in great numbers, 

 they are not restricted to the peripheral portion of the layer, but 

 often extend in as far as the circular muscle. It is thus evident 

 that in Zygeupolia the term cutis is synonymous with outer longi- 

 tudinal muscle layer. In this respect Zygeupolia differs greatly 

 from the genus Eupolia, in which a cutis distinct from the outer 

 longitudinal muscle layer ia present. 



The finer structure of the cutis, or of the outer longitudinal 

 muscle layer, may be seen in fig. 2. Each longitudinal muscle 

 fibre, L.M.f., is surrounded by a sheath of connective tissue, com- 

 posed of the slender processes of the connective tissue cells which 

 are present between the muscle fibres. These cells are greatly 

 branched, their nuclei, Cn.T.K, are oval, and contain a .small 

 amount of chromatin. Slender radial muscle fibres, r.m.f., trav-

erse the cutis, and here aud there detached circularly running 

 fibres, U.S., occur. 



The siibej)ithelial gland cells, or, as Biirger terms them, the cutis 

 glaud cells, are present throughout the body in the outer longitu- 

 dinal muscle layer. Two, and possibly three, types of glands may 

 be distinguished. 



The first type is a multinucleate structure, fig. 2, Cu. GL^, stain- 

 ing with hsematoxylin. Such a gland is the probable result of the 

 fusion, phylogenetically, of several simple cells. The proximal 

 portion resembles a bunch of grapes, each grape representing a cell 

 with its nucleus ; the distal part is a long, slender duct, opening to 

 the exterior between the epidermal cells. The length of the blue- 

 staining cells varies in different parts of the body. In the head 

 region, fig. 2, they are very long, extending in from the epithe- 

 lium nearly to the rhynchodteum. In the posterior part of the 

 body, fig. 15, Cu.Gl.i, their length has diminished more than 

 one-half. 



The second type is a cell, staining red with eosin, having the 

 shape of a very slender flask with a long neck, figs. 2, 1.5, 

 CuGLf Only one nucleus is present, at the basal end of the cell, 

 and a delicate cell membrane may be distinguished. 



Two quite distinct appearances have been observed in the red- 

 staining cells. These may be morphologically different cells, or 

 merely phases of the one type. In the one, figs. 2, 15, Cu.Gl.i, 

 the granules are very fine, close together, and stain a rose red ; in 

 the other, fig. 15, Cu.Gl.u, the granules are large, rounded and a 

 brighter, more metallic red. The facts that no transition :^tages 

 have been observed, and that the two varieties hkve a slightly 

 different distribution, may indicate that they are morphologically 

 different. 



The distribution of the cutis gland cells is a point of some in- 

 terest and, so far as I am aware, has not been worked out in any 

 detail among the other Nemerteans. In certain parts of the body 

 the glaud cells are aggregated into very prominent zones, and it 

 seems probable that these glandular areas have some important 

 physiological function, which is as yet undetermined, aside from 

 the usual one of producing the slime sheath for the body. 



Diagram 1 illustrates the distribution of the cutis gland cells.

665 



It is seen here that the most 

 anterior part of the head is 

 entirely free from cutis gland cells, 

 but that about 0.5 mm. behind 

 the tip the blue-staining cells 

 are very abundant, distributed 

 uniformly on all surfaces of 

 the body. The red-staining 

 cells occur in small numbers 

 and are mostly on the ventral 

 surface; they are of the finely 

 granular vai-iety. From the 

 mouth back to some distance be- 

 hind the nephridia the blue- 

 staining cells are quite numer- 

 ous, intersj)ersed with the red- 

 staining cells. Just behind the 

 great rhynchocwlomic expansion, 

 where the circular muscle of the 

 body wall is considerably thick- 

 ened, comes a region that might 

 properly be called a glandular 

 zone, Gl.Z., owing to the enorm- 

 ous increase in the number of 

 the cutis gland cells. The 

 whole outer longitudinal muscle 

 layer is so crowded with them 

 that in a cross section the muscle 

 fibres seem nearly obliterated. 

 The cells increase also in size, 

 or perhaps are more distended 

 with secretion. The blue-stain- 

 ing cells are more abundant 

 than the red. This zone ex- 

 tends backward for about 3 mm. , 

 then suddenly ends, just in front 

 of the two lateral grooves, L. G. 



In the lateral groove region, fig. 

 23, CkG-7.,, Cu.Gl.,, the blue 

 cells are confined to two tracts, one 

 on eaca side of the body, above 

 the lateral nerves. The red-stain- 

 ing cells are in four tracts, dorsal

aud ventral to the blue tracts. The red-staiuing cells in Ihis 

 region and in the preceding glandular zone are of the coarse granu- 

 lar variety. 



After the beginning of the middle intestine aud its pouches, the 

 blue-staining cells are no longer present, except at the most poste- 

 rior end of the body.' The four tracts of red-staining cells, how- 

 ever, continue along the entire length of the intestine. Owing to 

 the increased size of the intestinal coeca and the gonads, the body 

 wall is stretched and the muscular layers are thin, so that the red 

 gland cells can reach down only a short distance, and are conse- 

 quently short, often appearing more like epithelial cells. 



At the extreme posterior end of the body both red aud blue 

 cells are present in great numbers all around the body. The red 

 cells are the more abundant, and are considerably larger than the 

 blue (see fig. 15). Both fine and coarse varieties occur. 



There is no cutis in the caudicle, so that cutis gland cells are 

 necessarily absent. 



c. The Body Musculature. — The entire region of the head in 

 front of the brain, Plate XLI, tig. 18, from the epithelium, Ep., in 

 to the rhynchodseum, Rd., is made up of lougitudinal muscle fibres, 

 L.M., with interlacing radial muscle fibres, r.m.f. Except for the 

 cerebral nerves, C.N., and the cutis gland cells, Cu.Gl.,, and 

 probably some very fine blood lacunae, no other organs are present. 

 The wall of the rhyuchodxum, which will be described under that 

 heading, contains four stout bundles of lougitudinal muscle, Rd.M. 



Just anterior to the attachment of the proboscis to the body 

 wall, the inner ends of the radial fibres interlace more 

 closely about the rhyuchodreum, until a ring of circular muscle, 

 tig. 18, CM., is formed, which becomes the circular mus- 

 cle of the proboscis sheath. Behind the attachment of the 

 prolioscis, fig. 19, y., the outermost circular tibres separate off 

 from the rest, thus forming the circular muscle of the body 

 wall, tig. 19, CM., outside the proboscis sheath. The longitu- 

 dinal fibres lying between, fig. 20, LL.M., represent the be- 

 ginning of the inner longitudinal muscle. 



Both dorsal and ventral brain lobes, tig. 19, D.L. and V.L., lie 

 outside the circular muscle, CM., in the outer longitudinal layer; 

 but the cerebral organs, tig. 21, C. Or<j., which are directly behind 

 the dorsal lobes and receive their nerve supply from them, lie within 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 667 



the circular muscle, in the inner longitudinal layer. At the pos- 

 terior end of the dorsal lobes the following changes may be noted. 

 The circular fibres, figs. 19, 20, CM., at first all run along the 

 inner surface of the end of the dorsal ganglion and beginning of 

 the cerebral organ, then a few fibres bend out and curve around 

 the sense organ on its outer side, until finallj' all the muscle fibres 

 lie on the outside of the cerebral organ, fig. 21, CM. The ven- 

 tral ganglia lie as before, outside the circular muscle. 



Just in front of the moulh a strong band of muscle, fig. 21, 

 H.M., runs from side to side, beneath the rhynchoceel and above 

 the median blood vessel. 



In the cesophageal region, fig. 22, there is nothing unusual in 

 the structure of the muscle layers; the outer longitudinal, o.L.M., 

 is the thickest, and nest the circular, CM. This arrangement 

 continues past the nephridia into the region of the expanded rhyn- 

 choceel, where all layers of the body wall are greatly stretched, 

 and consequently very thin. 



A short distance anterior to the middle intestine the rhyncho- 

 coeloraic dilation ceases and the diameter of the i-hynchocad is about 

 equal to that of the cesophageal region, while its walls are fre- 

 quently folded and constricted. In this part of the body the cir- 

 cular muscle of the body wall becomes greatly thickened (see Plate 

 XLIV, fig. 62, CM.). 



Inner Circular Muscle. — Fig. 23, Plate XLI, is a cross section 

 of the body just anterior to the beginning of the middle intestine. 

 The diameter of the body is less than in the ojsophageal region 

 (cf. fig. 22), and much less than in the great expanded portion 

 which is not figured. The outer longitudinal muscle in fig. 23 

 needs no description ; the circular muscle is relatively thicker than 

 in the anterior part of the body, but not greatly enlarged. The 

 circular muscle of the proboscis sheath has increased greatly in 

 size and some of its outer fibres run ventrally, making a band of 

 circular muscle, I.C.M., that encircles the stomach, S. Other 

 fibres, apparently from the circular muscle of the body wall, join 

 with these, running dorso-ventrally, and crossing the inner longi- 

 tudinal layer dorsally and ventrally. In short, cm inner circular 

 muscle layer is lie re present; and muscular crosses occur between 

 it and the outer circular layer, both dorsally and ventrally' (see 

 tig. 23, D.m.cr., V.m.cr.). A few sections posterior to the one 




668 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



figured in fig. 23, tl'e inner circular rausc-le layer suddenly ends 

 and the first pair of creca of the middle intestine appear. On 

 examining the sections anterior to fig. 23, it is found that the 

 inner circular muscle extends forward for about 1.8 mm. as a very 

 thin layer of a few fibres (see Plate XLII, fig. 30, i.C.3I.), 

 the thickened region, as in fig. 23, only extending over a few sec- 

 tions. 



At its beginnincr the inner circular muscle, as seen in cross sec- 



DO ' 



tions, measures about .006 mm. dorso-veutrally; over the greater 

 part of its extent the measurements range from .012-.017 mm. ; 

 then suddenly increase from .023 to .06 in about five sections of 

 6/i each; finally just before the end, fig. 23, the layer is .087 mm. 

 thick. 



The inner circular muscle encloses a band of longitudinal muscle 

 fibres on the dorsal side of the stomach, below the rhynchoccel, Plate 

 XLII, figs. 23, 30, i.L.M. 



The fibres of the inner circular muscle layer are direct continua- 

 tions of fibres from the circular layer of the proboscis sheath. 

 Furthermore, in the anterior part of the layei", the fibres come 

 from the inner surface of the proboscis sheath, bend out, cross the 

 outer fibres and then continue down around the stomach. This 

 bending out and crossing is shown in fig. 30, z. In a more poste- 

 rior position, the inner circular layer becomes thicker and consists 

 of fibres from the outermost part of the proboscis sheath, togetlier 

 with fibres from (he circular nniscle of the body wall. It is thus 

 seen that the partial origin of the inner circular muscle layer of 

 ZygeupoUa from the proboscis sheath circular muscle is beyond a 

 doubt. 



;\.n inner circular muscle layer has not been heretofore described, 

 as such, for any Heteronemertean. I have found a very similar 

 layer in Micntra cieca, with a considerable thickening at the poste- 

 rior end, but this has not been mentioned in any published work, 

 so far as I am aware. Coe (1901) describes in Micrura alaskensk 

 a structure that might properly be called an inner circular 

 muscle layer. He says, p. 72: " The delicate layer of circu- 

 lar and longitudinal muscular fibers which surrounds the epi- 

 thelial lining of the esophagus in most of the Heterouemer- 

 teans becomes remarkably developed in this species. At the 

 very posterior end of the esophagus — just anterior to the 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 669 



first intestinal pouches — the circular muscles of the esophagus 

 increase so greatly in number that they form a most conspicuous 

 layer. In the region of its maximum development this layer 

 becomes nearly half as thick as the circular layer of the body (vails in 

 the same section. lu no other species of the Lineidaj has this 

 muscle been found of even approximately this thickness. Its fibers 

 connect in part with the circular layer of the body walls and to a 

 lesser degree with the circular muscles of the proboscis sheath. 

 But few fibers lie on the dorsal wall of the esophagus, so that this 

 organ is largely bound up with the proboscis sheath in a continu- 

 ous layer of muscles, and one cannot fail to see the striking resem- 

 blance between this circular layer and the inner circular muscles 

 that are so highly developed in precisel)' the same region in 

 Carinoma." 



Since, as Dr. Coe says, the resemblance between this mus- 

 cular layer and the inner circular layer of Carinoma is so striking, 

 why should we not regard them as one and the same structure, that 

 is, as homologous ? In what particulars do they differ ? 



Biirger (1895), p. 234, gives the following definition for the 

 inner circular muscle layer of the Protonemerteans and Carinoma. 

 " Die Leibesmusculatur. Zu dieser rechne ich eiuen aus Ringfibril- 

 len zusaiumengesetzten Muskelschlauch, welcher bei den Frotone. 

 mertinen, vor allem bei Cariaina grata, und Carinella polymorpha, 

 superba und linearis, und unter deu Mesonemertinen bei Carinoma 

 armandi um Vorderdarm und Rhynchocolom entwickelt ist, diese 

 beiden Hohlcylinder einschliessend. Diesen iSIuskelschlauch nenne 

 ich die inuere Ringmuskelschicht." Biirger also states that the 

 fibres of the inner circular muscle differ in no way from those of 

 the body wall. 



Biirger further speaks, p. 235, of the crossing of fibres that 

 frequently occurs in the dorsal and ventral median line of the 

 body, between the inner circular and the outer circular layer of 

 the bod}^ wall. " Eine sehr merkwiirdige Erscheinung wird 

 dadurch hervorgerufen, dass die innere Ringmuskelschicht in 

 Beziehung zur ausseren Ringmuskelschicht, also der Ringmuskel- 

 schicht des Hautmuskelschlauchs tritt. Das geschieht, iadem 

 dorsal und ventral in der Medianebene des Thierkorpers von links 

 und rechts Muskelfasern aus dem Verbande beider Ringmuskel- 

 schichten heraustreten, und, die Liingsmuskelschicht des Haut- 




670 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. , 



muskekchlauchs durchdringend, die von der eiaen Ringmuskel- 

 schicht kommenden iiber Kreuz an die andere hinantreten. " 



The definition, then, of the inner circular muscle is a layer of 

 circular muscle fibres that encloses the rhynchocrel and anterior 

 intestine, the individual fibres being just like those of the body 

 wall. 



Since there is a common agreement with Burger's definition 

 among the three muscle layers under discussion, namely, that in 

 Micrura alashensls, that in ZijcjeupoUa, fig. 23, i.C.M., and that in 

 Micrura coeca; and furthermore, since all three layers have muscu- 

 lar crosses between themselves and the circular muscle of the body 

 wall, I can see no reason why each should not with all propriety 

 be termed an inner circular muscle layer, homologous with that of 

 the Proto- and Mesonemerteans. 



The only difference between the inner circular muscle layer of 

 Zygeupolia and that of the Carinellas and Carinoma is in the 

 amount of surrounding connective tissue, the body " pareuchym " 

 of Burger. In Zijrjeupolia this tissue is present only around the 

 blood vessels, so that the inner circular muscle layer adjoins the 

 inner longitudinal muscle layer, except where the blood vessels 

 intervene. In this particular Zygeupolia resembles Cariniiia, for 

 in Carinina the inner circular muscle borders directly on the longi- 

 tudinal muscle, and there is no intervening layer of " Leibes- 

 pareuchym." 



The presence of the inner circular muscle layer and the muscular 

 crosses in Zygeupolia and Micrura is important when viewed from 

 a phylogenetic standpoint. This peculiar region of the bodj', just 

 in front of the middle intestine, is by far the most interesting part 

 of the whole trunk, for it has uuaccountal)ly remained in a primi- 

 tive condition, as comparison with other Nemerteans will show. 



Diagram 2 is a representation of the stages, illustrated by 

 living, more primitive genera, through which the inner circular 

 muscle of Zygeupolia and Micrura may have passed. A, represents 

 the most primitive condition, found in Carinclln annnlata, in 

 which the inner circular muscle is a thin layer of uniform thick- 

 ness, extending throughout the body; iu B, Carinella polymorphu, 

 the muscle is co-extensive with the body, but is thickened in a 

 certain region ; iu C, Carinella linearis, the muscle ends shortly 

 behind the thickened region; in D, Carinoma, the muscle ends

 E, shows the condition in Zygeupolia and Micrura. In the last two 

 forms the inner circular layer is absent from the entire oesophageal 

 region, and is represented merely by the thickened part in front of 

 the middle intestine, and a short, thin, anterior extension of this.' 



In this connection it is interesting to note that in Cephalothrix 

 aliena, a new species from the Maldive Islands recently described 

 by Punnett (1901 a), a very delicate inner circular muscle layer is 

 present in the oesophageal region. 



From the facts just enumerated it is evident that the inner cir- 

 cular muscle of the Heteronemerteans may be regarded as the rem- 

 nant of a layer once continuous throughout the body. 



The accompanying table shows the comparative extent of the 

 inner circular muscle layer in the different genera in which it 

 occurs. 



The second part, relating to the muscular crosses between inner 

 and outer circular layers, shows that there is great variation in 

 this respect in the genus Carinella. 



'The facts in regard to the distributioa and stractare of the inner circu- 

 lar mnscle in the genus Carinella have been obtained from Biirger's mono-

674 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



[Dec, 



Biirger (1895), p. 257, speaks of a musculature ( " Darmmuscu- 

 latur") that is developed iu the Meso-, Meta- and Heteronemer- 

 teaus around the posterior part of the oesophagus, consisting of both 

 longitudinal and circular fibres, the fibres being more slender than 

 those of the body wall. 



On p. 237 the same writer says that the dorso-ventral fibres that 

 occur so frequently between the intestinal cajca, and also iu the an- 

 terior part of the body, may be regarded as parts of a formerly con- 

 tinuous inner circular muscle layer. " Wir konneu die dorsoven- 

 trale Musculatur als eine innere Ringmuskelschicht, welche in 

 lauter, in gewissen Abstiinden aufeiuanderfolgende Ringe zerlegt 

 wurde, vorstellen." He adds that sections of Eupolia and Lineus 

 genlculatus, the latter figured on Taf. 20, Fig. 7, strengthen this 

 opinion. In L. genlculatus the dorso-ventral fibres have bent 

 around the intestine, on its dorsal as well as on its ventral face, 

 making a continuous ring of circular muscle, and a crossing be- 

 tween these fibres and the circular muscle of the bodv wall takes 

 place in the median ventral line.

From my own observations upon Cerehratulm lacteus, Lineus 

 lacteus and a Lineus sp. , all preparations kindly lent by Dr. Mont- 

 gomery, I find there is frequently quite a considerable layer of 

 circular muscle fibres beneath the intestine, and also on its dorsal

side. These fibres may be almost invariably traced out of the 

 circular sheath around the intestine into dorso-ventral fibres comincr 

 from the circular muscle of the body wall, or else into the circular 

 muscle of the proboscis sheath. This is illustrated by Diagrams .3 

 and 4. The same is true in regard to the scattered fibres occa-

It therefore seems that, if we accept the view of Burger that the 

 dorso-ventral fibres are derived from an original inner circular 

 muscle layer, we may profitably go a stej. farther and say that 

 the " Darmmusculatur " or " ffisophageal muscle," found around 

 the dorsal as well as the ventral side of the oesophagus, is derived 

 from the dorso-ventral fibres which have turned aside from their 

 dorso-ventral course and have curved around the cesophagus so as 

 to partially encircle it. If this is accepted we may then say that 

 the "(esophageal muscle" is secondarily derived from the inner

circular muscle, two steps being involved in the phylogeny: first, 

 the inner circular layer breaks up into detached groups of dorso- 

 ventral fibres, then the latter turn out of their course and bend 

 around the intestine to form the encircling " oesophageal muscle."

This view is foreshadowed by Hiibrecht (1887), p. 71, where 

 he says: " I will not at present attempt to decide whether any of 

 the muscular layers of the tesophagus, noticed both in Eupolia and 

 Cerebratulus' (PL VI, fig. 9, a.m.; PI. XIII, fig. 6, mto.), may 

 also be looked upon as derivatives of this inner circular 

 layer. . . .;" and "Here, too [alluding to the Sehizonemerteans], 

 I would be tempted to hazard a comparison between the absent 

 inner circular layer and the musculature of the proboscis sheath." 



To briefly summarize my views in regard to the presence and

origin of tlie inner circular muscle layers in the Heteronemerteans : 

 (1) the more or less delicate layer of circular muscle fibres encir- 

 cling the alimentary tract in the cesophageal region of Zygeupolia 

 and ilicrura is a primitive structure, the remnant of a once 

 extensive layer; (2) further investigation will probably demon- 

 strate the presence of similar primitive remnants of an inner 

 circular muscle layer in other Heteronemertean genera; (3) the 

 " oesophageal muscle " fibres that frequently encircle the alimen- 

 tary tract in the higher Lineidre are continuations of deflected 

 dorso-ventral muscle fibres. They are not primitive but of more 

 recent structure, secondarily derived from the inner circular mus- 

 cle layer by a breaking down of the latter into groups of dorso- 

 ventral fibres. 



The inner circular muscle layer ends with its great thickening 

 just in front of the beginning of the middle intestine, so that 

 posterior to this region the body musciilature consists of the usual 

 three layers — outer longitudinal, circular and inner longitudinal 

 (see figs. 24, 25, 26) — which are very thin in the region of the 

 gonads. 



Histology of Muscular System. — Very little need be said in regard 

 to the histology of the muscle. Each muscle fibre, as Burger first 

 demonstrated in 1890, is a single ceil. The nuclei are long and 

 stain deeply. 



In Plate XL, fig. 13 is shown a portion of the circular muscle 

 layer from the posterior end of the body, drawn from a section 

 stained with iron-h^ematoxylin. At regular intervals, dark areas, 

 contr., are seen, alternating with light areas. The dark portions 

 represent the most contracted part of the layer, the light a region 

 of less contraction, or of rest. In the middle of the light areas, 

 very faint indications may be seen of a smaller region of contrac- 

 tion. The contraction caused by fixation has evidently occurred in 

 waves, as the regular intervals show. These contracted areas were 

 first noticed in the Nemerteans by Hubrecht (1887). 



Wagener (1863) describes '•'striated" muscle from a Nemer- 

 tean, the genus of which is not mentioned. He says the striated 

 areas (" Querstreifuugen " ) alternate with thinner, lighter parts, 

 and that the cross-striping merges into a non-striated portion. 

 A fibre separated from the bundle has a series of swellmgs 

 ( " Anschwellungen " ) on its surface, ^yagener's Fig. 1, Taf. 




678 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec. , 



IV, shows that what he regards as cross striations are evidently 

 merely swollen, i. e. , contracted areas of the fibres. 



2. The Nervous System. — a. Anatomy. — Biirger (1895) 

 divides the nervous system of the Nemerteans into a central and a 

 peripheral system. The former comprises the brain and lateral 

 nerve chords, which have a thick investing layer of ganglion cells; 

 the latter, all other nerves and nerve layers, provided with a thick 

 ganglion cell envelope. Montgomery (1897 b), p. 382, includes 

 in the central nervous system all parts provided with ganglion 

 cells, namely: " (1) the dorsal and ventral brain lobes and com- 

 missures: (2) the lateral nerve chords . . . ; (3) the paired 

 oesophageal nerves; (4) the longitudinal nerves of the probos- 

 cis .. . ; (5) the dorsal, unpaired, larger median nerve of the 

 body wall; and probably also (6) the lesser, unpaired median 

 nerve. " 



The anatomy of the brain of ZijgeupoUa may be readily studied 

 in life from a specimen compressed beneath a cover glass, for the 

 head is so transparent that the parts are easily distinguished (see 

 figs. 1, 16). The brain lies about 4 mm. behind the tip of the 

 head, directly in front of the mouth, encircling the rhynchoccel, 

 and consists of four lobes or ganglia of about equal size, two dorsal 

 and two ventral. Viewed from the dorsal surface, the dorsal 

 lobes, fig. 16, D.L., are most prominent, and at their posterior 

 ends are situated the pear-shaped cerebral organs, C.Org., which 

 are about one-third the length of the dorsal lobes and about one- 

 half their width. The dorsal lobes are connected above the rhyn 

 cliocccl by a slender commissure, which is very difficult to see in 

 life, figs. 1, 16, D.Coinm., but is easily made out from sections. 

 Its dorso-venlral measurements vary in different specimens from 

 .04-.07 mm., probably owing to different states of contraction, 

 or to the plane of the section. In the sections of one specimen, 

 fig. 19, the dorsal commissure appeared to be composed of fibres 

 coming from both dorsal and ventral lobes, an unusual condition, 

 and one not previously described in Nemerteans, so far as I am 

 aware. Tlie ventral lobes are united by a stout commissure, about 

 14 mm. measured dorso-ventrally, that in life may be i>lainly seen, 

 figs. 1, 16, shining through the rhynchoccel, which lies above it, 

 and extending backward posterior to the dorsal commissure. Meas- 

 ured from side to .side, both cnnimis<ures are short, owing to the 




lyOl.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 679 



close proximity of the braiu lobes. The dorsal and ventral lobes of 

 each side are connected anteriorly, as may be seen from sections, but 

 the connection ends just posterior to the end of the ventral com- 

 missure, and from this point backward the dorsal and ventral lobes 

 are quite separate. In life the ganglion cell layer appears distinct 

 from the fibrous core of the brain and lateral chords, the former 

 as a greenish-yellow investing layer, the latter as a clear silvery- 

 gray central mass. 



From sections it may be seen I hat both dorsal and ventral lobes 

 are continued forward into the tip of the head as numerous slen- 

 der nerves, which are approximately represented in Plate XL, fig. 

 1. No especial nerve endings have been observed. The dorsal 

 lobes terminate as such just iu front of the cerebral organs, and from 

 their posterior ends arise the nerves that supply the cerebral 

 organs. Immediately in front of Ihe cerebral organ, the dorsal 

 lobe gives off on its dorsal side a horn or prolongation of the 

 fibrous core surrounded by ganglion cells. This horn ends shortly 

 and is replaced posteriorly by the cerebral organ, but there is no 

 connection between the two structures, for the cerebral organ derives 

 its nervous matter from the ventral part of the dorsal lobe. The 

 cerebral organ nerve enters the cerebral organ on the ventral side 

 and afterward branches and ramifies, so that the nervous material 

 is well distributed throughout this sensory organ. 



The ventral lobes are continued backward throughout the body 

 and caudicle as the lateral nerve chords (" Seitenstiimme"), fig. 1, 

 L.N., but do not unite posteriorly in an anal commissure. 



The paired wsophageai nerve?, fig. 16, Oe.N., arise from the ven- 

 tral lobes in the same frontal plane as the cerebral organs, but con- 

 siderably ventral to them. A slender commissure, fig. 16, Oe.N. 

 Comm., is formed between them, .03 mm. behind their origin, out- 

 side the circular muscle layer, just anterior to the mouth, M. 

 Behind the commissure the nerves pass through the circular and 

 inner longitudinal muscle into the tissue around the mouth, occa- 

 sionally giving off branches, and continue backward into the 

 oesophageal region. Here they break up into numerous fine 

 branches which ramify iu the walls of the cesophagus, not only on 

 the ventral side but also laterally, and which are very abundant 

 on the dorsal side. 



From the dorsal commissure arises the median unpaired upper 




680 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



dorsal nerve, first termed by Huhrecht the ' ' Riisselselieidennerv, ' ' 

 later the "medullary nerve;" by Burger denominated the " obereu 

 Riickennerv." The dorsal nerve extends throughout the body 

 and ends about .06 ram. in front of the anal opening. No con- 

 nection could be traced between the end of the dorsal nerve and 

 the lateral nerves, but it is probable that a delicate plexus exists. 

 The position of the dorsal nerve is constant, just above the circu- 

 lar muscle in the median plane of the body. A second doi-sal 

 nerve (" Riisselscheidennerv, " Hubrecht; " unterer Riickennerv, " 

 Biirger), separates off from the first shortly after its origin, passes 

 inside the circular muscle of the body wall and lies just above the 

 proboscis sheath. Both nerves are of fair size, about .017 mm. 

 in diameter in the anterior part of the body, but both become 

 much enlarged in the region of the muscular crosses between the 

 greatly thickened inner circular muscle and that of the body wall, 

 Plate XLI, fig. 23. Here for a short distance the diameter of the 

 inner nerve reaches a thickness of .03-06 mm. There is consider- 

 able variation in the respective sizes of the two nerves in different 

 specimens. Sometimes the upper nerve is the larger one, but more 

 often the lower nerve attains the greater size. The greatest size 

 observed was in a specimen whose lower dorsal nerve measured 

 .117 mm. dorso-ventrally and .058 mm. across; the upper dorsal 

 nerve measuring .017 mm. in both directions. This enlarged con- 

 dition coincided with the thickest part of the inner circular muscle 

 layer. The same coincidence has been noted in the Protonemerleans 

 and Carinomahy Hubrecht (1887), who says, p. 80: " The factthat 

 in this (cEsophageal) region of Cariiioma the proboscidian sheath- 

 nerve comes into the foreground so strongly that it might easily be 

 mistaken for the medulla, may probably be ascribed to the mas- 

 sive development of the inner circular muscular layer 5, which in 

 Carinina, Carinella and C'arinoma acts at the same time as part of 

 the wall of the proboscidian sheath. The fact was already noticed 

 as a peculiar feature of the species by M'Intosh (1875), when he 

 first described C'arinoma (under the name of Valenciniaarmandi)." 

 Posterior to the region of the inner circular muscle the two dorsal 

 nerves resume their normal .size, and then gradually deci'case until 

 they terminate near the end of the body. 



Throughout the greater part of the body the lateral nerves are 

 connected with eacli other and with the upper dorsal nerve by a 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 681 



nervous layer of fibrous substance ( " plexus ' ' of Hubreoht, ' ' Ner- 

 venschicht " of Burger), situated outside the circular muscle. It 

 is especially strong in the oesophageal jjart of the body, and in the 

 inner circular muscle region, fig. 23, n.p. Posteriorly the layer 

 is very thin, or may be entirely absent. 



In one specimen a peculiar condition of the lateral chords was 

 observed, Plate XLIV, fig. 62, L.N. A part of the fibrous sub- 

 stance extends toward the centre of the section in between the fibres 

 of the circular muscle, CM. : the fibres iu the same radial line as 

 the nerve are bent o.ut of their course, and in the space thus 

 formed is the apparent branch of the nerve, running inward. This 

 condition was not confined to a few sections, but extended over 

 several slides, a distance of at least 1.5 mm. It at first seemed 

 as if a series of nerves was being given ofi from the inner lateral 

 face of the nerve chord, instead of from the dorsal and ventral 

 sides, the usual method in Nemerteans (Burger). Several other 

 specimens were examined, but this peculiarity was not found in 

 them, and I am unable to account for it. 



The proboscis is innervated by two slender branches that arise 

 from the dorsal surface of the ventral commissure and immedi- 

 ately run dorsally into the proboscis, which is attached at this point 

 to the body wall. The two proboscis nerves, Plate XLII, fig. 35, 

 P.N., are distinct in the anterior part of the proboscis, but in the 

 " middle region," as will be described in that section, they become 

 a continuous nervous layer, fig. 40, n.p., separating again near 

 the end of the proboscis into two distinct nerves, fig. 41, P.N. 



b. Hidolo(j II of Nervous Sydem. — ^The brain lobes, as described by 

 Burger (1895) and Montgomery (1897 b), consist of (1) the 

 fibrous core, (2) the inner neurilemma, (3) the ganglion cell layer, 

 and (4) the outer neurilemma. 



There is little to be said in regard to (1) and (2), as these 

 structures in Zijgeupolia conform to the usual Nemertean type. 



In the ganglion cell layer of the brain occur the three types of 

 nerve cells, the small, the medium-sized and the large, described 

 by Burger and Montgomery and denoted as I, II and III. Mont- 

 gomery describes the cells of the first type, p. 385, as " densely 

 massed together and of a shortened pyriform shape. The nucleus 

 is very large in proportion to the cell body, in fact, nearly filling 

 it . . . ." This description may also be applied to the cells of 




682 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OK [Dec, 



the first type in Zygeupolia, figs. 20, 9, G.C.x, which are found 

 abundautly on the dorsal and outer lateral sides of tlie dorsal 

 lobes, and on the outer lateral sides of the ventral lobes. They 

 are very numerous around and in the cerebral organs. 



The cells of the second type, figs. 20, 10, G.C.u, are elongated 

 and pear-shaped. The cytoplasm is more abundant than in I, 

 the nucleus is oval and centrally placed, containing relatively le.ss 

 chromatiu than that of I. These cells are arranged usually in 

 radiate clusters, and theii distribution in Zygeupolia agrees with 

 that described for other Nemerteans by Biirger and Montgomery, 

 namely, on the ventral lobes and along the lateral chords, never 

 in the dorsal lobes. 



The cells of the third type, figs. 20, 8, G. C.,,,, are much larger 

 than either I or II, but vary considerably in size. They are 

 long, pear-shaped cells, with the greatest diameter proximally. 

 The nucleus is large, round, and centrally placed, with a large 

 nucleolus, and the chromatin distributed throughout the nucleus. 

 Montgomery states that " while the cell bodies vary considerably 

 in size, their nuclei remain of nearly uniform dimensions." 

 These cells are found in both dorsal and ventral lobes and along 

 the lateral chords. 



A fourth type of cell has been discovered and named by Burger 

 (1894), namely, the colossal neurochord cells. Biirger (1899), 

 p. 105, states: " Neurochordzellen fand ich bei alien von mir unter- 

 suchten Curebratulen, ferner bei Langia Jormom. Das Gehirn 

 besitzt stets nur ein einziges Paar von Neurochordzellen, welches 

 an der medialeu Fliiche der ventralen Ganglien dort gelagert ist, 

 wo die Schlunduerven eiitspringen. Zahlreiche Neurochordzellen 

 befindeu sich iudesscu ira GanglieuzcllbelagderSeitenstiimme . ..." 

 Biirger also found in the Metanemerteans Drepanophorus and 

 Promdenoporux one pair of neurochord cells in the l)rain, but 

 none along the lateral chords. The presence of neurochord (;ells 

 in Cerebralulius lacietis has been demonstrated by Montgomery 

 (1897 h). who found that " the colossal ganglion cells (IV) of 

 C'erebratuhii are present in three pairs in the ventral brain lobes, 

 and are distributed irregularly along the lateral chords, but are 

 wholly absent in both ends of the latter (namely, in the wsopha- 

 geal region and in the caudiclej." 



In Zygeupolia a pair of large cells is found on the median sides 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 683 



of the ventral brain lobes, about .06 mm. behind the ventral com- 

 missure. Both cells lie in the same transverse plane. In one 

 very favorable specimen the nerve tubule of one cell could be 

 traced into the fibrous core of the ventral lobe. These cells are 

 elongated, with the greatest diameter at the rounded proximal 

 end, and surrounded by a sheath of connective tissue fibres, 

 Plate XL, fig. 3, Ca. T. S. The length of the cell body is about 

 .058 ram., the greatest width about .029 mm., the diameter of the 

 nucleus .012 mm. The cytoplasm stains a pale violet, hematoxy- 

 lin and eosin stain, and has a slightly granular appearance. The 

 somewhat oval nucleus is proximally placed, the chromatin is dis- 

 tributed around the jieriphery, and one large nucleolus is present. 



From the position, size and structure of these cells it seems not 

 unfitting to term them neurochord cells. 



Biirger has observed that neurochord cells occur in those forms 

 that swim freely, and he thinks there may be some correlation 

 between the occurrence of neurochords and the swimming habit. 

 While it would be hasty to say that Z'jcjenpoUa has not the power 

 of free swimming, it has not been observed swimming, either in 

 nature or iu captivity. In its native habitat it is always found 

 below the surface of the sand, and while in an aquarium it never 

 rises to the surface, but remains on the bottom, burrowing in the 

 sand, if there is any present, and surrounds itself as soon as possi- 

 ble with a slime sheath to which particles of sand adhere. When 

 placed in a shallow dish of water the head is usually kept erect 

 and continually swaying about, but there is little or no movement 

 of the body as a whole. 



It should be mentioned here that one pair of large ganglion 

 cells, from their structure and position evidently neurochord cells, 

 has lately been observed by the writer in Micrara cwea. It is not 

 improbable that the occurrence of these cells among the Nemer- 

 teans is more common than is generally supposed. 



The outer neurilemma is but slightly developed in Zygeupoiia. 

 It is found around the ventral lobes, but does not occur to any 

 extent around the dorsal lobes or along the lateral chords. 



3. Sense Organs. — a. The Cerebral Organs. — The cerebral 

 organs appear in life, Plate XL, figs. 1, 16, C. Org., as rather pear- 

 shaped bodies situated at the posterior ends of the dorsal brain lobes, 

 above the ventral lobes. They are silvery gray, except the poste- 




684 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



rior euds, which are dark greenish and contain large globules that 

 have an oily appearance, the secretion from the posterior gland 

 cells. The large blood vessels, in which the posterior euds of the 

 cerebral organs lie, are very noticeable in life, fig. 16, C. Org. V. 

 They are usually expanded, and the floating blood corpuscles may 

 be .seen even with a low power. 



Each cerebral organ consists of the following parts: (1) the 

 ciliated pit, opening directly to the exterior; (2) the ciliated canal, 

 leading from the pit to the anterior end of (3) the cerebral organ 

 proper. 



The ciliated pit is the most anterior part of the cerebral organ. 

 It is a flask-shaped cavity, lined with a ciliated epithelium that is 

 differentiated histologically into several regions which will be de- 

 scribed below. The pit opens directly on the surface of the head, 

 there being no lateral slits, and in life is usually widely expanded, 

 the long cilia beating vigorously. In fixed preparations the pit 

 has a small external aperture, a narrow neck and the inner flask- 

 shaped portion, Plate XLI, fig. 21, Cil.P. 



The ciliated canal, Cil.C, is a narrow duct, a continuation of 

 the inner end of the ciliated pit. It extends in the transverse 

 plane of the body from the ciliated pit to the anterior end of the 

 cerebral organ proper, then, making a sharp turn at right angles to 

 itself, it enters the cerebral organ and continues backward to the 

 posterior end, where it terminates blindly. 



The cerebral organ proper is a pear-shaped structure, wide at 

 the anterior end and gradually becoming narrower at the posterior 

 extremity. The cerebral organ nerve, which arises ventrally from 

 the posterior end of the dorsal brain lobe, enters the anterior end 

 of the cerebral organ on the dorsal surface, just in front of the 

 entrance of the ciliated canal, and then ramifies throughout the 

 organ. 



The basement layer of the body epithelium is continued beneath 

 the epithelium of the ciliated pit and forms around the cerebral 

 organ an envelope of connective tissue, fig. 21, Cn.T.S., of a 

 thickness about equal to that of the inner neurilemma of the brain 

 lobes. In fig. 21 the thickness of the basement layer and cerebral 

 organ sheath is slightly exaggerated. The most anterior part of 

 the cerebral organ is completely surrounded by muscular tissue — 

 the inner longitudinal muscle on the inner surface, the circular 

 muscle on the outer side. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 685 



The change in the relative position of the circular muscle in 

 respect to the dorsal brain lobes and the cerebral organs has 

 already been described, the circular muscle lying on the inner side 

 of the dorsal lobe, but, with the beginning of the cerebral organs, 

 bending out so as to adjoin their outer surfaces (cf. figs. 19 and 

 21). 



From fig. 16 it may be seen that the cerebral organ vessels, 

 C.org. v., lateral branches from the median vessel, M. V., run for- 

 ward, partly encircling the cerebral organs and ending blindly near 

 their anterior ends. The anterior part of the cerebral organ (see 

 fig. 21, right side) is but partly surrounded by the blood vessel, 

 while the posterior end,* fig. 21, left side, lies nearly free in the 

 blood vessel, being attached at the extreme tip to the body wall. A 

 noticeable thinning of the connective tissue envelope accompanies 

 the increase of the surface in contact with the blood vessel, and at 

 its posterior end the cerebral organ is covered only by a low 

 epithelium of square flattened cells, except at the point of attach- 

 ment to the muscular wall, where a small portion of the connective 

 tissue sheath persists, fig. 21, left side. 



Histology. — The epithelium of the ciliated pit consists of three 

 sharply differentiated regions: (1) the epithelium of the outer 

 part, or the neck of the pit; (2) the epithelium lining the median 

 part of the pit; (.3) the innermost epithelium, 'adjoining that of 

 the ciliated canal. These three regions may be seen in fig. 21, 

 Cil.P. The epithelial cells have the same general structure in all 

 three regions, except that the cilia of the cells in the median part 



(2) are much longer. A cell from the median part (2) is shown 

 in fig. 7. It is a slender cell, with an expanded distal end on 

 which the long cilia, CiL, are borne, and tapering into a fine stalk 

 at the proximal basal end; the small nucleus, N., lies just above 

 the stalk. Each cilium consists of a basal knob, an upper knob 

 and a ciliary thread. 



Between the ciliated supporting cells of the outer (1) and inner 



(3) regions, numerous large interstitial connective tissue cells are 

 present, and their nuclei, fig. 21, Cii.T.N., are very noticeable in 

 sections. The median (2) region is characterized by its longer 



* Tlie section drawn in fig. 21 is rather obliquely cut, so that on the 

 right the plane of the section passes through the ciliated pit and the begin- 

 ning of the cerebral organ, while on the left only the posterior part of the 

 cerebral organ is seen. 




686 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



cilia and the complete absence of the interstitial connective tifsue 

 cells. In a horizontal section of the ciliated pit the contrast 

 between the three regions is very marked. In a preparation 

 stained with htematoxylineosin, the outer and inner regions are 

 studded with the deep-blue nuclei of the connective tissue cells, 

 while the median region appears pink, from the cytoplasm of the 

 supporting cells, their small nuclei being very inconspicuous. 



The epithelium of the ciliated canal is a one-celled layer. The 

 cells are much lower and wider than those of the pit and bear 

 shorter cilia. 



The anterior part of tiie cerebral organ proper, fig. 21, right 

 side, is richly provided with gland cells, G^.,. These are large 

 pear-shaped bodies with long slender ducts that open into the 

 ciliated canal. The cytoplasm is abundant, especially at the base 

 of the cell where the large spherical nucleus is situated. The 

 secretion is homogeneous and stains red, hoematoxylin-tosin stain. 



The posterior part of the cerebral organ, fig. 21, left side, con- 

 tains other gland cells of a different character, GL^. The cyto- 

 plasm is inconspicuous, the nucleus is small, and the secretion has 

 the form of large globules that stain a faint bluish-gray. These 

 cells are prominent in life, evidently containing oily globules. 



The cerebral organs are well supplied with nervous substance. 

 Ganglion cells of the first type, fig. 21, G. C. i, are very numerous. 



b. The Lateral Grooves. — The lateral grooves are two shallow 

 elongated pits extending horizontally, one on each side of the 

 body, above the lateral nerve chords. Each has a length of about 

 1.5 mm. 



The grooves are constant in position in the different specimens 

 examined, always beginning at the jwsterior end of the glandular 

 zone, Diagram 1, Gl.Z. and L.G., and ending about 1.5 mm. in 

 front of the great thickening of the inner circular muscle and the 

 beginning of the middle intestine. 



The lateral grooves are distinctly seen in cross sections of this 

 region of the body, appearing as small pits or depressions in the 

 epithelium external to each lateral nerve chord, but they are not 

 macroscopically distinguishable in cither living or preserved speci- 

 mens, although they have been repeatedly sought. The shallowness 

 of the grooves has probably rendered them indistinguishable 

 except by the microscope. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 687 



The lateral areas of sections of the entire body have been care- 

 fully examined, but no indication of any constantly recurring de- 

 pressions could be found in any other region of the body, either 

 anteriorly or posteriorly. Here and there, of course, as in most 

 Nemerteans, are small depressions of the surface due to contrac- 

 tion and shrinkage, but their extent is very limited, and tbey may 

 occur in any position, dorsal, ventral or lateral. 



Fig. 62 is a cross section of a portion of the body wall through 

 cue of the lateral grooves. It shows that the lateral groove, 

 L.G., is a depression both of the body epithelium, Ep., and of 

 the outer longitudinal muscle layer, o.L.M. The epithelial cells 

 in the groove are rather closely crowded together, and the indi- 

 vidual cells are not distinguishable with the magnification used. 

 With a higher magnification, it may be seen that the epithelium is 

 composed of supporting cells, gland cells and interstitial connec- 

 tive tissue cells, just like the rest of the body epithelium. There 

 is no differentiation of the epithelial cells in the groove. Cutis 

 gland cells of the blue-staining type, Cu.Gl.i, are present in the 

 outer longitudinal muscle layer around the lateral nerve chord 

 below the groove, and their ducts open between the epithelial 

 cells of the groove. 



The peculiar appearance of the lateral nerve, as shown in fig. 

 62, has already been discussed. 



The question now to be considered is, What are the lateral 

 grooves ? Are they the result of contraction — i.e., artifacts — or 

 are they organs of the body ? 



The question whether the lateral grooves are merely contractions 

 seems to me to be disposed of by the facts of their constant posi- 

 tion, extent and regular occurrence in several individuals. The 

 alternativ^e, then, is that they are paired organs of the body ; but 

 witli what function ? 



When these grooves were first observed, I believed that they 

 were sense pits, comparable to the lateral sense organs ("Seiten- 

 organe") of the Protonemerteans, and I hoj)ed that further study, 

 both upon living worms and sections, would demonstrate the pres- 

 ence of sensory cells and possibly of nerves. 



The careful study of sections has not revealed any differentia- 

 tions of the epithelial cells of the lateral groove, although no 

 especial nerve technique, such as the Golgi or methylen blue 




688 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. , 



methods, lias been employed. The possibility remains that under 

 such treatment nerves and sensory cells may yet be demonstrated. 



The strongest evidence in faVor of considering the lateral grooves 

 as sense organs is the fact that dermal sense organs — aside from 

 the well-known lateral sense organs ( " Seitenorgane" ) of the Pro- 

 tonemerteaus, and the frontal organs of other forms — have lately 

 been discovered in certain Nemerteans. 



In the anterior part of the body of Parapolia aurantiaca Coe° 

 there occur paired structures, resembling the lateral grooves of 

 Zygeupolia, and in the same relative position — that is, in the sides 

 of the body posterior to the nephridia and anterior to the middle 

 intestine. Plate XLTV, fig. fi3, represents a transverse section of 

 a part of the body wall of Parapolia through one of the lateral 

 grooves. From this it may be seen that the outer longitudinal 

 muscle, just outside the lateral nerve chord, contains an abundance 

 of large swollen cutis gland cells, C'u. Gl.-,. These celLj stain blue 

 with hrematoxylin and are present only in the vicinity of the lat- 

 eral nerves, being absent from the rest of the cutis. The section 

 figured shows that the ' ' lateral groove ' ' is elevated above the 

 general surface level, but in other sections it is depressed into a 

 groove. 



This elevation and depression of the "groove" is interesting 

 when one recalls that, according to Burger (18!)5), the Protoue- 

 mertean lateral sense organs and the ^letanemerteau frontal organs 

 may be both iuvaginated and everted. Xo differentiated sense 

 cells or nerves are distinguishable in the " grooves " of Parapolia. 



The length of the groove of Parapolia is about the same as 

 that of Zijgeupolia, and they are probably homologous structures. 



In the twelve dermal sense organs of the head, lately described 

 by me (1900 b) for Caritioma trem,aphoro% altliough undoubted 

 sensory cells are present, only in one case could a nerve, running 

 to the pit, be demonstrated. 



The recent discovery of a pair of lateral sense organs in the 

 new Heteronemertean Micrella ritfa Puuuctt (1!)01 b) is of great 

 interest and value. Punnett describes " a lateral sense organ on 

 either side (fig. 2) shortly behind the excretory pore. In the pre- 



' Dr. Coe has very kindly allowed me to examine the slides of his type 

 specimen of Parapolia and to make drawings of the sense organs. One of 

 these is shown on PI. XI>IV, fig. G'.i. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 689 



served animal it is conspicuous as a small longitudinal slit (fig. 5) 

 about .75 mm. long on either side. It is lined with characteristic 

 glandular epithelium, resembling that found in the head slits 

 (fig. 6)." 



These facts suggest the po.*sibility that the lateral grooves of 

 Zygeupolia may be sense organs that are either in process of forma- 

 tion, or Ihat have degenerated and lost their sensory character. 



There remains one other interpretation of the lateral grooves, 

 which has been suggested by the presence of the great glandular 

 zone in front of the grooves and the situation of the gonads poste- 

 rior to them. The glandular zone may have a function like the 

 clitellum of the Annelids, and the lateral grooves may be like the 

 grooves found along the sides of the body of an earthworm, and 

 serve to conduct the mucous secretion to the egg cells. This last 

 hypothesis could be substantiated only by a careful study of the 

 habits of Zygeupolia. 



4. The Rhynchod^um. — Immediately behind the tip of the 

 head on the ventral surface may be found a very small opening, 

 the proboscis pore (" Riisseloffnung "), which is the external open- 

 ing of the rhynchod;eum. 



The rhyuchodaeum is the rather cylindrical cavity that extends 

 through the head from the point of attachment of the proboscis 

 with the body wall, Plate XL, fig. 1, ?/, forward to the pmboscis 

 pore. P.p., at the tip of the head. It is the path of exit for the 

 evaginated proboscis. 



A transverse section through the rhynchodseum shows that its 

 walls are provided with four strong bundles of longitudinal muscle, 

 seen in Plate XLI, fig. 18, Ed. 31., and that it is lined with a cili- 

 ated epithelium. This lining is very delicate and liable to be torn 

 away, and usually can be seen only at the most anterior part of the 

 rUynchodieum. It may persist farther back, but the cilia are 

 mostly broken off in the preparatious that have been sectioned. 

 The cilia of this epithelial lining are considerably longer than those 

 of the body epithelium. 



5. Rhynciioccel and Proboscis Sheath. — The proboscis, fig. 

 I, P., lies in a spacious cavity, the rhynchocrel. Re, the muscular 

 walls of which form the so-called ' ' proboscis sheath. ' ' The rhyn- 

 choco?! is closed anteriorly by the attachment of the proboscis to

690 PROCEEUIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



the body wall, figs. 1, IG, y, and posteriorly euds blindly about 

 .8 mm. in front of the anus, fig. 17, Re. 



In the brain i-egion the rhynchocojl is very narrow, passing 

 between the dorsal and ventral commissures, fig. 20, Re. A con- 

 stant widening of the rhynchocoel takes place in the oesophageal 

 region, fig. 22, and the widest, most expanded part usually lies above 

 that portion of the body extending from the nephridia to the 

 beginning of the middle intestine (see fig. 1). At the latter 

 point the great increase of the circular muscle layer of the probos- 

 cis sheath and of the inner circular layer causes a sudden con- 

 striction of the rliynchocojl, fig. 23. Posterior tn this narrowed 

 region, which is quite short, the rhynchocoel again widens, then 

 gradually narrows more and more until near the end of the body 

 the cavity is scarcely demonstrable. 



The rhynchocwl is filled with a fluid in which float numerous 

 long narrow cells, fig. 43, the " rhynchociel corpuscles" of Biir- 

 ger, " Navicula" of Quatrefages (1846) and Keferstein (1862). 

 These cells are long and spindle-shajjed, larger in the middle 

 where the nucleus lies, and tapering to a fine point at each end. 

 They arc flattened and ribboulike, as may be seen when the cell is 

 twisted. Burger (1892) has described an "attraction sphere" 

 in the cytoplasm by the side of the nucleus. These do not appear 

 in my preparations and, unfortunately, the rhynchociel corpuscles 

 were not studied in life. In one cell, however, the nuclear mem- 

 brane curves in on one side, and a lighter zone in the adjoining 

 cytoplasm may be seen, l)ut there are no astral radiations. In 

 another cell, fig. 43, N„ two nuclei are present, i>robal)ly the 

 result of amitosis. 



A second, smaller type of coll, fig. 42, is also found in the 

 rhynchociel, resembling the free corpuscles in the blood vessels. 

 Tiiese cells are rounded, witl\ finely granular cytoplasm and 

 prominent nuclei. 



The layers of the proboscis sheath arc as follows (see figs. 2(1, 

 50 J : 



1. The circular muscle layer, C.M.p.s. 



2. The longitudinal muscle layer, L.M.p.s. 

 .'!. The basement layer, B.L. 



4. The epithelium, Rc.Ep. 



The muscular layers are rather tliin in the head region, except 




1901.] NATUKAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELl'HIA. 691 



when especially contracted. The basement layer is a homoge- 

 neous, gelatinous-looking, fibrous connective tissue layer, resem- 

 bling that of the proboscis and body epithelia. The epithelial cells 

 in the anterior part of the rhynchocoel, Plate XLlll, fig. 50, are 

 not in close contact with each other and do not form a flattened 

 endothelium. They are small, slender, pear-shaped cells, attached 

 by their proximal ends to the basement membrane, with the nuclei 

 at their di.stal ends, which project freely into the rhynchocwl. 

 Farther back these cells become a flattened endothelium. 



The dorsal blood vessel in this region is bordered on its ventral 

 surface by nuDierous bundles of longitudinal muscle, evidently 

 derived from the longitudinal muscle of the proboscis sheath. 



From the end of the esophageal region to the beginning of the 

 middle intestine the rhynchocwl is usually greatly dilated, the pro- 

 boscis is intricately coiled and much of the rhynchoca'lomic fluid is 

 centred here. Frequently the entire proboscis is drawn forward 

 into this region, leaving the posterior part of the rhynchocad quite 

 empty. 



The proboscis sheath in the expanded region is stretched to it? 

 greatest extent, so that it appears in cross section as an extremely 

 thin sheet of tissue, and its component layers are scarcely distin- 

 guishable. 



In the posterior part of the rhynchocoel — i.e., in the part lying 

 above the middle intestine — the circular muscle is the predominating 

 la3'er in the proboscis sheath, the longitudinal muscle being repre- 

 sented by a very small number of fibres. 



A word may be said here iu regard to the comparative extent 

 and character of the rhynchocad and i^roboscis sheath in the differ- 

 ent groups of Nemcrteans, and of its position in respect to other 

 organs. 



In the Protonemerteans the rhjiichocad is short, its extent being 

 only about one-third that of the body. It is widest iu the ne 

 phridial region, then becomes constricted, owing to the thickening 

 of the inner circular muscle, but again widens somewhat before its 

 termination, just in front of the beginning of the middle intestine. 

 In the words of Burger (1895), p. 95 : " Das Ehynchocolom 

 ist vor der Nephridialregion am geraumigsfen, in derselben wird 

 es durch die miichtig angeschwollene innere Ringrauskelschicht 

 sehr betriichtlich eingeengt und erweitert sich wieder etwas, nach- 




692 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



dem jene abgenoramen hat, liiuter den Nephridien." In Hu- 

 hrechtia the rhynchocoel is short, ending just in front of the begin- 

 ning of the middle intestine. To quote Burger again, p. 106: 

 " Der Mitteldarra rou H, beginnt in der hinteren Region des 

 Rhynchocoloms. In diesem vordersten Abschuitt des Mitteldarms 

 erscheinen die Taschen nur als flache seitliche Ausbuchtungen des 

 sehr geriiumigen centralen Darmrohres. Sobald das Rhyn- 

 chocolom aufhort, verengt sich aber das centrale Rohr, uud nun- 

 mehr werden die Taschen sehr umfangreich, sie erfiillen die Korper 

 fast vollig." 



Carinoma has the rhynehocojl extending throughout the body, 

 but the character of the proboscis sheath is very diverse. In no 

 other Nemertean is the inner circular muscle so highly developed, 

 and as this muscle layer increases in thickness, the muscle of the 

 proboscis sheath becomes thinner and finally disappears altogether. 

 But with the ending of the inner circular muscle in the 

 uephridial region, the proboscis sheath again acquires a muscula- 

 ture of its own. This region is also the beginning of the middle 

 intestine — " Sowie der Vorderdarm aus dem inneren Ringrauskel- 

 schlauch herausgetreten ist, beginnt der Mitteldarm," Biirger 

 (1895), p. 113. In Callinera b'urgeri, Bergendal (1900 a), the 

 rhynchoeoel ends in the anterior part of the middle intestinal region 

 bv a great muscular swelling of its lateral and ventral walls. 

 Bergendal, p. 314, describes this as follows: " Das Rhyncho- 

 coelom besitzt schwache Wande, bis dasselbe sich dem zweiten 

 Drittel des Korpera niihert. Da erhiilt es zuerst eine sehr starke 

 Grundschicht, die bald weiter nach hinten wieder verdiinnt wird 

 und in einea miichtigen Muskelsack eindriingt Die dor- 

 sale Wand des Rhynchoctrloms schwiudet und besteht nur in eiuer 

 etwas verstiirkteu Grundschicht. Die seitliche und ventrale Wand 

 wird um so dicker und besteht aus sehr schonen bogenfiirmigen 

 Muskelbiindern .... diese Schicht ist beinahe so miichtig wie 

 die halbe Dickc des Korpers. " 



From these data it is seen that in Nemerteans with a short rhyn- 

 chocad, the termination of the latter is near the end of the nephri- 

 dial region and the beginning of the middle intestine, and usually 

 coinciding with the thickening, when present, of the inner circular 

 muscle. Carinoma is no exception to this, for we may regard its 

 long rhynchoccel as merely a secondary development backward 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 693 



behind the usual point of termination. The same may be said of 

 Zygeupolia. The expanded rhynchocwl is constricted in the region 

 of the inner circular muscle at the beginning of the middle intes- 

 tine, and instead of ending here, as may have been the case primi- 

 tively, has secondarily developed backward through the whole 

 length of the body. 



6. The Peobo?cis. — The proboscis, Plate XL, tigs. 1, 16, P., 

 is attached to the body v;all in the brain region, just anterior to 

 the dorsal commissure. It lies in the rhynchocoel, Re, bathed by 

 the rhynchocaOomic fluid. The posterior end is not attached to the 

 wall of the rhynchocci'l but is entirely free, there being no retractor 

 muscle. 



In regard to its histology the proboscis may be divided into 

 three regions, which, however, pass very gradually into one an- 

 other. These parts are (1 ) the anterior region, which is compara- 

 tively short, being of about the same length as the a^sophagus, 

 above which it lies; (2) the middle region, comprising the greater 

 part of the proboscis; and (3) the extreme posterior region, only 

 a few millimeters in length. 



In the following descriptiou the nomenclature of Burger (1895) 

 will be followed, by which in the unevaginated proboscis the layers 

 nearest the central cavity are termed the inuer layers, those toward 

 the periphery the outer. 



The Anterior lieglon. — This part of the proboscis is usually 

 straight anil the average diameter is 0.116 mm. A cross section, 

 Plate XLII, fig. 35, has the following layers: 



1. The outer epithelium, o.Ep. 



2. The subepithelial layer of circular muscle fibrils, Ep.M.f. 



3. The outer basement layer, o.B.L. 



4. The longitudinal muscle layer, L.M. ! 



5. The lateral nerves, P.N. 



6. The inner basement layer, i.B.L. 



7. The inner epithelium, i.Ep. 



The outer epithelium, fig. 44, o.Ep., in the most -anterior part 

 of the anterior region, consists of low, rather brick-shaped cells, 

 in which the cytoplasm is quite abundant, and whose nuclei are 

 large and prominent. Farther back the cells are lower and 

 finally form a flattened endothelium, that is frequently torn away 

 in ray preparations. 




(594 TEOCEfiDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



Just beneath the outer epithelium i?i a layer of very fine muscle 

 fibres, Ep.m.f., running circularly around the proboscis. These 

 raaj' be termed the subepithelial circular muscle layer^ of the pio- 

 boscis. In a cross section of the proboscis, fig. 85, these fibrils 

 are in longitudinal section, but in a longitudinal section of the 

 proboscis, fig. 38, they are cut transversely, anu it ma}' be seen 

 that the layer is only one fibril thick. 



The basement layer, or ground substance, is a homogeneous, 

 gelatinous-looking structure of considerable thickness. It is a pro- 

 duct of the fibres of connective tissue cells, and their nuclei may 

 be found scattered here and there among the fibres. The thick- 

 ness varies considerably in ditferent specimens. It may be most 

 favorably studied in a specimen fixed with Gilson's fluid, one of 

 the best fixatives for connective tissue. The region of the greatest 

 thickness is always in the anterior part of the proboscis and rapidly 

 diminishes toward the middle region. 



The longitudinal muscle layer, L.M., consists of bundles of fibres, 

 about eight to ten fibres in each. 



The two proboscis nerves, P.N., are distinct from one another, 

 each surrounded by a sheath of connective tissue. 



The structure of the inner basement layer, i.B.L., is similar to 

 that of the outer layer but is only about one-third as thick. The 

 inner epithelium, i.Eu., is a one-celled layer. The cells are square 

 in cross section, the cell -membranes distinct and the nuclei large 

 and rounded. Between the epithelial cells are numerous gland 

 celLs, TrV.j, the contents of ■which stain dark blue with hiematoxy- 

 lin. The central cavity of the jiroboscis is (juite large in this 

 region. 



The transition stages between the anterior and middle retjions 

 are characterized by the decrease in thickness and the almost total 

 disappearance of the outer basement layer. Its diminution is 

 coincident with the establishment of a circular muscle layer on 

 the axial side of the longitudinal muscle. A considerable amount 

 of connective tissue appears within the new circular muscle layer, 

 forming the core of the papilla; into which the inner surface 

 of the proboscis is now raised. A considerable increase in the

height of the inner epitlielial cells may be noticed, and gland cells 

 are becoming more numerous. 



The Middle Region. — The proboscis is usually greatly twisted 

 and coiled, and the maximum diameter is found here, about 

 0.4 mm. The layers are as follows (see figs. 38, 40) : 



1. The outer epithelium, o.Ep. 



2. The subepithelial layer of circular muscle fibrils, Ep.m.f. 



3. The outer basement layer, o.B.L. 



4. The longitudinal muscle layer, L,M. 



5. The circular muscle layer, CM. 



6. The nervous plexus, n.p. 



7. The connective tissue of the papilhe, On. T. 



8. The inner epithelium, i.Ep. 



1, 2, ?,, 4 and 7 have essentially the same structure as in the 

 transition stages. The notable features of this region are found in 

 the circular muscle and the inner epithelium. Shortly after the 

 appearance of the circular muscle laj'er, there is a crossing of the 

 circular 'fibres at one point out through the longitudinal layer.

The fibres of the cross are very thin, and after crossing are appar- 

 ently continued as the subepithelial circular layer of fibrils before 




696 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



described. It is a fact worthy of note that although the crossing 

 of the circular fibres takes place first in the middle region, the 

 subepithelial layer of circular fibrils extends almost to the anterior 

 end of the proboscis. 



In some specimens the muscular cross is present on the dorsal 

 surface only (see Diagram 6, D.X.), in others there is a weaker 

 cross on the ventral side, fig. 40, and in still other specimens the 

 two arms of the ventral cross are very faint, and lie about 120° 

 apart (see Diagram 7, F.X. ). In this latter case there is an 

 exceptional arrangement of the longitudinal muscle fibres of the 

 proboscis. The dorso-ventral diameter is about .145 mm., and 

 almost one-half of the area of the proboscis is occupied by the 

 circular muscle of the ventral side, Diagram 7, K. The muscle 

 fibres have increased enormously on tiiis side, and spaces filled 

 with a connective tissue reticulum separate the wide part of the 

 layer from the narrower, normal jjart. Through these connective 

 tissue areas run the fibres of the ventral cross. 



The lateral nerves are separate at the beginning of the middle 

 region, but farther back they spread out into a thiu nervous layer, 

 fig. 40, 11. p., which forms a continuous ring around the proboscis, 

 along the inner surface of the circular muscle. 



The glandular inner epithelium of the middle region is charac- 

 terized by a structure that will be termed the glandular ridge, 

 Plate XLII, fig. 40, Gl.R. The dorsal surface bears an eleva- 

 tion consisting of a core of connective tissue, Cn. T., wliich is con- 

 tinued throughout the middle region. The epithelium clothing the 

 ridge is very specialized. The entire surface of the ridge is thrown 

 into a series of lesser elevations, or knobs, covered l)y masses of rod- 

 shaped bodies that are aggregated iu clusters, each cluster on a small 

 papilla. With hajmatoxylin-eosin these rods stain a bright red, 

 and are evidently glandular secretions. Biirger (1895) has 

 described and figured, from the probosces of living worms, very 

 similar structures, which he has termed rhahdites. Biirger con- 

 siders each rhabdite as the product of a single cell. As the red- 

 staining bodies iu Zygeupolia bear a close resemblance to the rhab- 

 dites of Biirger, they will receive the same term. Unfortunately 

 the proboscis of Zygeupolia was not studied in life, so that the de- 

 scriptions here given are based wholly on sections.' 



' The best fixation for the rhahdites is 95 per cent, alcohol ; their structure 

 is also shown, but not so well, with corrosive sublimate and 50 per cent. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 697 



Fig. 36 shows a small branch of the glandular ridge, on the sur- 

 face of which are several clusters of rhabdites. The section has 

 passed through the centre of the branch, exposing the central 

 connective tissue core, the lightly shaded area, Cn. T. No nuclei 

 have been seen in the rhabdite cells, probably owing to the great 

 number and the close proximity of the glandular secretions. 



The inner epithelium of the ventral surface is of quite a different 

 character. A certain amount of interstitial connective tissue is 

 present at the base, but there are no elevations. The most promi - 

 nent constituents of the epithelium are the large pink-staining 

 (hrematoxylin-eosin) gland cells, fig. 40, Gl.^. These cells are 

 quite elongated, the distal ends are large, and the proximal ends 

 are narrowed into a slender stalk. The cell body is entirely filled 

 with the granular secretion, and the nucleus lies just above the 

 stalk. Between the gland cells are very slender cells, somewhat 

 resembling epithelial supporting cells in shape. The nucleus is at 

 the base of the slender cell body, and in the distal cytoplasm may 

 be found one, or sometimes two, rods shaped like a thorn, with 

 flat base and pointed end. The base is embedded in the cyto- 

 plasm, the pointed ends project beyond the cell. These structures, 

 fig. 40, Th., stain a deep blue, hasmatoxylin-eosin ; brownish with 

 the Ehrlich-Biondi stain. 



The Posterior Region. — The diameter of the proboscis in the 

 posterior region, fig. 41, is constantly decreasing, until at the 

 extreme tip it measures only .04 mm. 



The outer epithelial cells, fig. 39, o.Ep., like those of the ex- 

 treme anterior region, are rather brick-shaped cells with abundant 

 cytoplasm, and do not form a flattened endothelium. The muscle 

 layers have decreased relatively to the other tissues; and instead of 

 the nervous plexus of the middle region, there are, again, two 

 separate lateral nerves, P.N. The amount of connective tissue, 

 On. T. N. , has increased, and as the nuclei of these cells are large, 

 with but little cytoplasm, the effect produced is that of a layer of 

 undifferentiated tissue. The glandular ridge has disappeared, antl 

 the inner epithelium is of a uniform character, consisting of pink- 

 staining gland cells, Gl.-i, like those in the ventral epithehum of 

 the middle region. 



alcohol ; while they are swollen and quite tmrecnernizable with Flemmins's 



fluid. 




6!I8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



At the extreme tip of tlie proboscis the muscular layers almost 

 disappear, the connective tissue cells become even more abundant, 

 and the gland cells of the inner epithelium are replaced by low, 

 flattened endothelial cells. 



7. The Blood Yascilar Svstem. — The anterior part of the 

 head of Zyf/eujjolui, differs from that of most Nemerteans in being 

 quite devoid of blood vessels, and even of blood spaces that are 

 large enough to be seen, although there is no doubt a network of 

 capillaries too tine to be distinguishable either in life or in fixed 

 preparations. 



The blood system makes its first appearance in the brain region, 

 just behind the insertion of the proboscis, Plale XL, fig. 16. 



In the blood system the following parts may be found (see figs. 

 16, 17): 



(1) The fine paired head vessels, H.V.,' which unite to form 

 (2) the unpaired median vessel, M. V.; (o) the paired cerebral 

 organ vessels, C. Org. V.; (4) the unpaired dorsal vessel, D. V.; 

 (5) the paired lateral vessels of the bodj', L. V.; (6) the ventral 

 connectives of the lateral vessels (fig. 22), V.bl.con.; (7) the 

 paired dorso-lateral vessels at the posterior end of the body, derived 

 from the forking of the unpaired dorsal vessel, Dl. V., and (8) the 

 central blood lacuna in the caudicle, Bl.L. 



In sections of the brain region, fig. 19, H. V., the head vessels 

 appear as two irregular clefts running <lorso-ventrally, one en each 

 side of the proboscis, just behind its insertion. These narrow slits 

 lie in the limited area between the proboscis sheath and the circular 

 muscle of the body wall, and in the vicinity of the ventral brain 

 commissure their ventral ends coalesce, forming an unpaired cres- 

 cent-shaped vessel, the median vessel, which encircles the lower 

 half of the proboscis sheath, fig. '20, M. V. 



The median blood vessel extends from this point backward-as far 

 as the mouth. In its course it becomes considerably deeper dorso- 

 ventrally, and is very noticeable in sections of 'this region. It 

 assumes a horseshoe shape, with the apex pointing ventrally and 

 the two long slender arms prolonged dorsally. In the vicinity of 

 the cerebral organs, fig. 21, the arms are cut off by a horizontal 

 band of muscle fibres, H.M., that lies beneath the cerebral organs 



' The reference line from II. V., in fig. 16, should extend iu sw far aj the 

 red lines indicatirg the head vessel. 




1901. J KATUKAL fSCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 69!) 



and the rhynchoca'l. so lliat only tlie triangular iniddle part of 

 the median vessel now remains. 



Immediately behiud the ventral brain commissure the unpaired 

 dorsal blood vessel arises from the median vessel, figs. 16, 21, D. V. 

 It passes up through the muscle layers of the proboscis sheath into 

 the rhynchociW, and continues in this position -on the floor of the 

 rhynchoca-l in the median line, but bounded dorsally by the rhyn- 

 ehoca'lomic epithelium- until about the middle of "the nephridiai 

 region, fig. 22. Here the dorsal vessel passes down through the 

 proboscis sheath and out again into the tissue that is just beneath 

 the rhynchocel and above the alimentary canal; and this position 

 IS retained throughout the remainder of its course, figs. 2.3, 24. 



In the anterior (esophageal region the lateral blowl vessels are 

 united beneath the oesophagus by ventral connectives. In one speci- 

 men the connectives are brosd and dilated, fig. 22, V.hl.con., in 

 others they are almost entirely shrunken together. The ventral con- 

 nection of the lateral trunks is continued throughout the esopha- 

 geal region, forming a network of fine anastomosing branches. It 

 IS probably further continued, in the remainder of the body, but 

 I have been unable to follow it in my specimens. 

 ^ In the a-sophageal region the lateral trunks lie on the dorso- lateral 

 side of the alimentary canal; in the middle intestinal region they 

 have moved ventrally and lie on the ventral side of the intestine. 

 No connection between the dorsal vessel and the lateral trunks 

 has been observed, except at the extreme posterior end of the 

 body. Some little distance in- front of the end of the body 

 proper (see fig. 17) the dorsal vessel divides into two, which for a 

 time he side by side, their walls adjoining. They then move apart, 

 and he in about the same relative distance frcm one another as do 

 the two ventral lateral trunks, so that in a section of this region, 

 fig. 26, four vessels are present, symmetrically placed. 



Just anterior to the anal opening the two doVsal vessels, or rather 

 the dorso-lateral vessels, descend and unite with their ventral fellows 

 in a large blood lacuna, fig. 27, BIL. This lacuna now occupies 

 most of the area inside the body musculature, for ihe intesiine curves 

 dorsally and shortly opens to the exterior on the dorsal surface 

 of the body. The large lacuna pas.=es on into the caudicle,-fig. 

 17, Bl.L., and continues throughout its length. It has no definite 

 walls, but is bounded by the muscular wall of the caudicle, on the 




700 rEOCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. 



inner surface of which are irregular groups of large mesenchym 

 cells, figs. 27, 28, mes. , many of which become detached and float 

 freely in the lacuna. 



Histology. — The wall of the median blood vessel is a one-celled 

 layer, fig. 29, of low, somewhat flattened cells that are wider than 

 high. The nuclei are oval and rather prominent and the cyto- 

 plasm clear and hyaline. In places the wall becomes a flattened 

 endothelium, often appearing in crt)ss section like a thin membrane, 

 along which the nuclei lie. 



The lining of the cerebral organ blood vessels is of a similar 

 character. 



The dorsal blood vessel, as already mentioned, lies, in the ante- 

 rior part of its course, in the raid-ventral wall of the rhynchocojl, 

 and posteriorly, beneath the rhynchococl. 



Fig. 50, a section through the dorsal blood vessel shortly behind 

 its origin, shows that the vessel is surrounded ventrally and later- 

 ally by bundles of longitudinal fibres, which are more numerou.s 

 here than on the other surfaces of the rhynchococl wall, and proba- 

 bly take part in the contractions of the vessel, while the dorsMi 

 surface of the vessel is bounded by the epithelial lining of the rhyn- 

 chncoeJ, Re.Ep. 



Tlie wall of the dorsal vessel consists of an endothelium. End., 

 of low, rather brick-shaped cells with large nuclei. The cells of 

 the ventral part of the wall are very regularly arranged, Plate 

 XLIII, fig. .">0, but the regularity of the dorsal wall is interrupted 

 by the proliferation of numerous blood-forming cells, Bl.f. C, that 

 project into the lumen of the vessel and remain for some time at- 

 tached to the dorsal wall liy their slender stalks. 



The boundary between the dorsal wall of the blood vessel and 

 the epithelium of the rhynchocwl is marked by a fine line, Bl. M. , 

 that varies in distinctness in different prejiarations. After the 

 Ineinatoxylin-eosiu stain it appears pink, after iron-ha;matoxylin, 

 black, so that it is probable that a few muscle fibres are present 

 liere, forming a very delicate circular layer around the dorsal sidi' 

 of the vessel. This line might also represent a deeply stained 

 connective tissue layer, but, since the dorsal vessel after leaving the 

 rhynclioc(t'l has a well-defined muscle sheath, it seems more likely 

 that this is the beginning of a muscle layer. 



The blood-forming cells are evidentlv enlarged endothelial cells.

that gradually separate oflf and become free. At first pear-shaped, 

 with a slender stalk, they later become rounded and are frequently 

 amceboid in outline, fig. 51 , Bl.f. C. The cytoplasm is finely granu- 

 lar in appearance and quite prominent. In the anterior (rhyn- 

 chocoelomic) part of the dorsal vessel the blood-forming cells arise 

 only from the dorsal side, but posteriorly from all sides of the 

 dorsal vessel (cf. figs. 50, 51). 



The dorsal blood vessel after leaving the rhynchocoel lies beneath 

 it and above the intestine, figs. 22, 23, immediately surrounded by 

 a network of connective tissue cells. The wall, fig. 51, consists of 

 an inner endothelium, End., and an outer circular muscle layer, 

 Bl.M., that in this region is continued around the entire vessel, 

 and is not confined to the dorsolateral surface, as in the anterior 

 region. The muscle fibres are very fine, but are clear and distinct, 

 and are especially well seen in tangential sections of the vessel. 

 The endothelium, End., is very irregular, being interrupted by the 

 proliferation of cells from all sides of the vessel. In places, many 

 consecutive sections of the vessel may be examined without finding 

 a single true endothelial cell, while numerous blood-forming cells 

 are present in each section. Two explanations for this are possible : 

 either all the endothelial cells have been changed into blood- 

 forming cells, or the endothelium has been rubbed or torn off. The 

 latter is supported by the fact that a thin lining of cytoplasm may 

 nearly always be seen on the inner side of the muscular layer, even 

 though no nuclei are present. 



The two dorso-lateral vessels at the posterior end of the body, 

 figs. 26, 49, have the same histological structure as the dorsal ves- 

 sel — the outer, circular muscle layer, and the inner, more or less 

 interrupted endothelium and numerous blood-forming cells. 



The lateral vessels, figs. 46, 47, L. V., and their ventral con- 

 nectives, V.bl.con., are lined anteriorly by low, brick-shaped cells 

 like those of the median vessel, with prominent nuclei and hyaline 

 cytoplasm. This endnthelium soon becomes more flattened and 

 membraneous. Here and there a blood-forming cell is given off, 

 fig. 46, Bl.f.C, but there is no abundant proliferation of these 

 cells as in the dorsal vessel. In the nephridial region the endo- 

 thelium of the lateral blood vessels is discontinuous, being absent 

 from the surfaces of the terminal bulbs. No muscular layer is 

 present in the anterior part of the lateral vessels, the wall consist- 




702 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. , 



ing merely of the endothelium. Outside of the membraneous en- 

 dothelium, in tlie more posterior part of the lateral vessels, fine 

 fibrils are seen. These may be either fine muscular fibrils, or the 

 end processes of the branched connective tissue cells that are so 

 numerous around the blood vessels. From their general appear- 

 ance, and from the absence of muscle fibres in the more anterior 

 part of the lateral vessels, I am inclined to regard them rather as 

 connective tissue fibres. 



8. The Excretory System. — The paired nephridia,' fig. 1, 

 Nph., lie in the anterior part of the body, about 6-7 mm. behind 

 the mouth, bordering on the ventral surface of the lateral blood 

 vessels and running parallel with them; they are about 2.5 mm. 

 in length, and there is no comnumicatiou between the two nephri- 

 dia. Each nephridium may be briefly described as a slightly con- 

 voluted tube, (the main duct) that opens to the exterior by a nar- 

 row duct (excretory duct) at its jiosterior end, and which ante- 

 riorly gives off a number of slender, thin-walled branches (the 

 ductules), each of these ending blindly in a group of specialized 

 cells, known as a terminal bulb (" Endkc'ilbeheu, " Biirger). 



The most anterior i^art of the nephridial system, consisting of 

 the terminal bulbs, fig. 47, T.B., and their ductules, Nph.d., is 

 found along the ventral .surface of the lateral blood vessels, L. V., 

 and their ventral connectives, Plate XLI, fig. 22, V. hi. con. No 

 main duct is jsresent in this region, and the irregular network of 

 the fine ductules and their blind ends at first seemed a hopelessly 

 confused mass of tissue, but by the careful study of serial sections 

 the relative arrangement of the parts lias been made out. 



The terminal bulb, Plate XLIII, fig. 47, T.H., is the blind en- 

 larged end of the fine ductule, Nph.d., coming from the main duct, 

 fig. 4(5, Nph. I). Each bulb consists of a number of cells, proi)ably 

 eight to ten or more, but it is difficult to determine this exactly as a 

 bulb does not always lie wholly in one section. The cell? of the bulb 

 are placed side to side about a central lumen, so that the walls of 

 the bulb are one cell thick. The height of the cells — that is, the 



•Several alteinpta were male to study the nepliritlii in life, but they 

 could be seeo in two specimens only. In these, merely the presence of the 

 main duct was uiade out, .lad in one case the excretory duct. The nietliy- 

 len blue method, employed by Biirger (1892, p. :i27, I'oDtuole) for the .study 

 of the nephridia of Eupnlin and various jletanenierteans, wa-i tried but 

 without .succesi, sd that the folloving description is ba.sed entirely upon the 

 etudv of sections. 




1901.] XATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELrillA. 703 



distance faorn the lumen to the periphery of the bulb — is greater 

 than their width. The peripheral ends are considerably enlarged 

 and often irregular iu outline; the luminal ends are frequently 

 produced into long slender processes that seem to take some part in 

 the formation of the stem of the bulb. The cytoplasm of the 

 peripheral (proximal) end takes a bright pink, hpematosylin-eosin 

 stain; the distal processes, however, stain very faintly. The nu- 

 cleus is large and fusiform, but appears round iu cross section, and 

 is situated in the expanded proximal end of the cell. 



After finding the terruiual bulb cells so well preserved in sec- 

 tions, it seemed most i)robable that the long branches of vibratile 

 cilia, the " ciliary flames " (" Wimperllanimen, " Biirger), present 

 iu the terminal bulbs of other Nemerteans, might also be found; 

 but although they have been carefully looked for, they have 

 net been seen. Cilia, fig. 46, CIL, are found on the cells of 

 the nephridial duct aud of the ductules, and generally in a good 

 state of preservation, so that it seems improbable that the cilia of 

 the bulbs should have been destroyed by fixation. On the other 

 hand, the analogy with the terminal bulbs of those Nemerteans that 

 have been exhaustively studied is in favor of their presence iu Zi/- 

 fjeupol'iu also. 



The bulbs project freely into the blood vessel all along its ven- 

 tral surface, and in one case a ductule was observed that passed 

 through the vessel, so that its bulb came to lie ou the opposite, 

 dorsal, surface. The epithelial lining of the blood vessel is fre- 

 quently broken and discontinuous iu the region of the bulbs, figs. 

 46, 47, and in no place are the bulbs covered by it, so that the 

 ends of the bulbs are directly bathed by the blood. The absence 

 of the blood vessel epithelium from the ends of the bulbs may fa- 

 cilitate the absorption of waste substance from the blood, and this 

 may account for the disappearance of the lining from around the 

 bulbs of the nephridia. 



No internal openings between the uephridiura and the blood 

 vessel, such as Oudemans describes in Carinoma arinandi, have 

 been seen. 



The nephridial ductules, figs. 46, 47, Xpk.d., the slender tubes 

 that connect the terminal bulbs and the main duct, are very sinu- 

 ous, and it is probable that several terminal bulbs may connect 

 with one ductule. Some ductules are ipiite long, especially those 




704 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF (Dec, 



that run along the ventral blood connectives. The wall of the 

 ductule is a one-celled layer and encloses a narrow lumen. The 

 cells are wider than high, with but little cytoplasm and elongated 

 nuclei. The cell surface turned toward the lumen bears cilia. No 

 basement membrane is present. 



About 3-4 mm. hchiiid the first appearance of the terminal bulbs 

 the main nephridial duct begins, fig. 46, Nph.D. It is situated on 

 the ventral side of the lateral blood vessel, in the angle made by 

 the junction of the ventral connective with the lateral vessel; the 

 msiu duet does not project into the blood vessel, but merelyadjoins 

 it with one surface, the other surfaces being surrounded by the fibres 

 of the inner longitudinal muscle layer. The main duct is about 2 

 mm. long and composes the greater part of the nephridium. Into its 

 anterior end for some little distance the ductules open, but behind 

 that there are uo diverticula until the excretory duct at the pos- 

 terior end is reached. The main duct is thick- walled, fig. 46, and 

 slightly convoluted throughout its length. The cells of the wall 

 are consideral)ly higher than wide, with quite sharply defined cell 

 membranes. The nuclei are prominent and are situated near the 

 outer or basal side of the cell, i.e., away from the lumen of 

 the duct. The outer surfaces of the cells are usually irregular, 

 and often bear amoeboid processes, no basement membrane being 

 present. The surface bordering on the lumen is ciliated, and the 

 basal knobs of the cilia are very distinct. 



In the cells of the main duct and ductules of one specimen 

 that had been fixed in a solution of sublimate in 50 per cent, 

 alcohol, and stained with hfematoxylin and eosin, were found 

 numerous prominent red-staining bodies of the same size as the 

 nucleus, but neither larger nor smaller ones. Wherever these red 

 bodies occurred they were found one to a cell, and at first it seemed 

 as if they were degenerating nuclei. Careful examination, how- 

 ever, detected the nucleus in each cell, of normal size, but 

 staining less deeply than usual. It is possible that these bodies 

 may be excretory masses, but their absence from the lumen 

 of the duct and the fact that no intermediate stages in their for- 

 mation have been seen would discredit this view. Burger (1890), 

 p. 93, describes in the nophridia of Carinella what may be simi- 

 lar masses: " Schon in den Zellen der .... Endkaniilchen und 

 Endkolben, fielen mir bis kerngrosse gliinzende griine Konkremente 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 705 



auf. Ueber ilire Natur musste icli im Unklarea bleiben ; niemal& 

 beobachtete ich solche im Excretionsgefasslumea selbst." 



The excretory duct, figs. 1, 45, Excel., is the small, thin-walled 

 tube that connects the main duct with the exterior. Its course is 

 in a plane at right angles to the plane of the main duct, and it 

 opens to the exterior just dorsal to the lateral nerve chord. Since 

 the excretory duct runs in a direct line to the epidermis with but 

 little turning or twisting, its length is merely the distance from the 

 main duct to the surface of the body wall. The cells composing 

 the wall are much lower than those of the main duct, and are 

 wider than high, the height being about .00(5 ram. Cilia are 

 borne on the inner surface. No basement membrane is present. 

 The cells of the excretory duct meet those of the body epithelium 

 at the surface of the body, there being little or no invaginatioa of 

 the epidermis. 



A good deal of evidently foreign matter from the exterior is 

 usually found in the excretory duct. 



9. The Alimentary System. — The alimentary canal of the 

 Heteronemerteans is usually divided into the following regions: 

 (1) The mouth; (2) the oesophagus, or anterior intestine (" Vor. 

 derdarm," Burger), a straight tube without lateral diverticula; (3) 

 the middle intestine (" Mitteldarm," Biirger), with lateral out- 

 growths or creca throughout its length; (4) the anal portion of the 

 intestine (" Enddarm"), a short region where the lateral cseca ar 

 no longer present, terminating in (5) the anal opening. Burger 

 (1895), p. 240, says: " Wir nennen den ungegliederten vorderen 

 Darmabschnitt Vorderdarm, den gegliederten, welcher der mittleren 

 und hinteren Korperregion charactei-istisch ist, den Mitteldarm. 

 Wir bezeichnen ferner am Mitteldarm den rohrenformigen Theil 

 als axiales Rohr, die peripheren Ausstiilpungen desselben als Darm- 

 tasehen. ' ' 



According to Burger, the oesophagus (Vorderdarm) lias fre- 

 quently two regions, an anterior and a posterior, that differ histo- 

 logically from one another. In Caruiella Burger finds the epithelium 

 of the anterior part of the "Vorderdarm" very rich in gland 

 cells, while the posterior part consists mostly of supporting cells 

 with a few scattered gland cells; and in Cerebratulus marginatum 

 he finds the same differentiation of anterior and posterior partsi 

 45 




706 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dcc, 



only in this genus the anterior glandular part is more extensive 

 than the posterior part. Burger's own words, p. 250, are: " Im 

 Vergleich mit Carinella setzt sich das Driiseuepithel der Jlund- 

 hohle, welches dort ja ganz iihulich wie bei Cerebrutulus margiiudus 

 beschaflen ist, aber nur die Mundhohle und den allervordersten 

 Absehnitt des Vorderdarms auskleidet, bei den Ccrebratulen weit 



nach hinlen fort Aber es fehlt aueh nicht jener zweite 



Abschnitt des Vorderdarms bei Cerebratulus, welcher sich durch 

 seine Driiseuzellen weseutlich von dera er?teu uuterscheidet und den 

 Uebergang in den bei den huheren Formen durch die Darmtascheu 

 aueh morphologisch von dem vorderen Darmabschnilt difierenzirten 



Mitteldarm bildet Es giebt also bei Cerebratulus, just wie 



bei Carinella, einen ausserst driisenreicheu vorderen und einen 

 auffallend driisenarmen hinteren Vorderdarmabschnitt. " 



In ZijfjeupoUa the ditlerences between the anterior aod the pos- 

 terior parts of the tube-like portion of the alimentary canal 

 (Vorderdarm) are so great that in this description the two parts 

 will be termed respectively the a?sophagus and the stomach. My 

 reasons for this are partly for the sake of brevity and clearness, 

 since the expressions " anterior part of anterior intestine" and 

 " posterior part of anterior intestine" are lengthy and awkward 

 to use; and partly to emphasize the very considerable differences in 

 the structure of the two regions. It is my belief that while the 

 oesophagus is evidently derived from the ectoderm, the stomach, 

 together with the middle intestine, owes its origin to the entoderm. 

 The term stomach is not altogether a happy one, since it at once 

 suggests the " Magendarm" or stomach intestine of the Metauemer- 

 teans, which may have a different embryological history; and yet, 

 on the other hand, the function of both is evidently digestive, 

 and the resemblances in the histology very striking. Both have a 

 truly glandular epithelium, as will be seen by comparing the sec- 

 tion of the epithelium cf the " Magendarm" of Drepanophonis lalus, 

 figured by Biirger (1895), Taf. 27, Fig. 17, with the epithelium 

 of the stomach of ZygeupoUa, Plate XLII, figs. 32, .33. 



Therefore, in ZygeupoUa the alimentary canal will be subdivided 

 into the following regions (see fig. 1): (1) The mouth, 31.; (2) 

 the oesophagus, Oes.; (3) the stomach, S. ; (4) the middle intes- 

 tine, M.I.; (5) the end intestine. E.I. (Enddarm), and (6) the 

 anus, fig. 17, .4. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 707 



The mouth, figs. 1, 16, M., is situated on the ventral surface of 

 the body, shortly behind the brain, and about 5 mm. from the tip 

 of the head. In a passive condition the mouth is a small round 

 opening, with crinkled edges forming a kind of circular lip, but 

 it is capable of great expansion, enabling the worm to swallow prey 

 nearly as large as itself. The tissue immediately encircling the 

 mouth is conspicuous in life by its greenish hue, caused by the secre- 

 tions of the numerous gland cells, tigs. 16, 31, w., that are situated 

 in the subepithelial tissue of the anterior oesophageal region. 



A cross section of the body through the mouth opening shows 

 that the mouth is lined with an epithelium of ciliated supporting 

 cells resembling those of the body epithelium, but with longer 

 cilia. No gland cells could be distinguished in the epithelium of 

 the mouth-opening proper, nor in the cutis beneath it. 



In the semi-transparent living ZygeupoUa the oesophagus and the 

 stomach may be easily seen under a low power in a slightly com- 

 pressed specimen. The ditiereni degrees of refraction of the two 

 parts makes Ihem easily distinguishable. The oesophagus, fig. 1, 

 Oe.* , appears rather light, while the stomach, S., is darker, 

 •denser and of a more granular appearance. It will be seen from 

 fig. 1 that the oesophagus is rather shorter than the stomach. These 

 two regions do not pass gradually into one another, but there is a 

 sudden transition which might be indicated by a straight line 

 drawn at right angles to the long axis of the alimentary canal (see 

 fig. 1), and sections show that there is an abrupt change in the 

 cell elements. In life there is an appearance of a fold at the be- 

 ginning of the stomach, which probably serves as a valve. 



Fig. 33 is a somewhat oblique cross section of the alimentary 

 canal through the line of division of oesophagus and stomach. The 

 slight obliquity takes the section through both resophagus and 

 stomach; the oesophageal epithelium, Oe.Ep., being present on the 

 ventral surface, the stomach epithelium, S.Ep., on the dorsal sur- 

 face. In the upper right hand part of the figure indications of a 

 fold, /., are seen, where the oesophageal epithelium apparently 

 passes over the stomach epithelium. 



The beginning of the stomach has a constant relative position, 

 occurring always in the same frontal plane with the anterior neph- 

 ridial region (see fig. 1). This fact is helpful in trying to find 

 the nephridia in life. 




708 PKOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dcc, 



The oesophagus extends backward from the mouth a distance of 

 about 9-12 mm., according to the size of the worm. The wall 

 of the oesophagus, figs. 31, 33, consists of an epithelium of ciliated 

 supporting cells, S.C., and gland cells, Gl.i, about .023 mm. in 

 height, very similar to that of the epidermis (cf. figs. 2 and 31). 

 The supporting cells are like those of the epidermis, only more 

 slender. The gland cells are flask-shaped, with finely granular 

 contents that stain a bright pink, htematoxylin-eosin stain. Blue- 

 staining gland cells are entirely absent. Both supporting and 

 gland cells rest on a delicate basement membrane, B.M., and 

 some interstitial connective tissue cells are found between the 

 bases of the epithelial cells. 



At the extreme posterior end of the oesophagus some of the epi- 

 thelial cells become much higher, but otherwise their structure is 

 the same. 



The subepithelial gland cells, that have been described above as 

 giving the greenish color in life to the circular "lip" of the 

 mouth, are present in great numbers immediately around the mouth, 

 and less abundantly throughout the greater part of the a^sophagus. 

 A group of these cells, w., is shown in fig. 31, from the anterior 

 part of the oesophagus. The glaud cells are large, the cell body 

 containing a secretion that is probably fluid in life, but appears 

 finely granular in the fixed preparations and stains rose red, 

 hiematoxylin-eosin stain. Some cells seem to have but one nucleus, 

 others more than one, but the latter case may be due to the crowd- 

 ing together of the cells or to the presence of the adjacent connec- 

 tive tissue nuclei, so that this point has not been definitely settled. 

 The ducts, dt., are long and slender, and open into the a'sophagus 

 between the epithelial cells. Farther back in Ihe o-sophagus these 

 subepithelial gland cells entirely disappear. 



The inner surface of the oesophagus is usually thrown into 

 numerous high papillte, especially the ventral surface (see fig. 33). 

 The papilla; are formed chiefly of longitudinal muscle fibres, but 

 contain also connective tissue cells and the subepithelial gland 

 cells, when they are present. The papilla; come to an end together 

 with the n'soi)hagus (cf. the dorsal and ventral surfaces of fig. 33). 



A few isolated strands of circularly running muscle fibres, fig. 

 33, M.S., are frequently found beneath the papillaj, partly encir- 

 cling the u'sophagus, but no continuous " ojsophageal " muscle 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 709 



layer is formed. The origin of these strands has been traced in 

 some cases to the circular muscle of the proboscis sheath, in other 

 cases to dorso-ventral fibres coming from the outer circular muscle 

 of the body wall. 



The change between the oesophagus and stomach is not only a 

 sudden but a very marked one (see fig. 33). Instead of the oesoph- 

 agus, with its low epithelium and its great extent of surface 

 caused by the high papillte, there is the stomach, without folds or 

 papillae and consisting of a very high epithelium, about four 

 times higher than that of the wsophagus, in which the large gland 

 cells are the principal element. The ciliated supporting cells, 

 S.C, are present, apparently in equal numbers with the gland 

 cells, but are so small and inconspicuous that they are easily over- 

 looked. In fact, four specimens were studied before their presence 

 was detected, and they were seen for the first time in an over- 

 stained specimen, where the deep blue stain taken by their cyto- 

 plasm and their ciliary bases was in strong contrast to the pink of 

 the adjacent gland cells. 



The gland cells of the stomach, fig. 32, Gl.„ are large, measur- 

 ing .087 mm. in height and .011 mm. in width. The distal end 

 is slightly narrowed into a neck, and the bas.al end into a slender 

 process that is inserted into the basement membrane, B.M. The 

 cell membrane is very distinct, and the cell body is filled with a 

 network of cytoplasm, in which are embedded large homogeneous 

 secretion globules that stain pink with eosin. Some shght color 

 differences seem to indicate different phases in the secretion, and a 

 few cells appearing lighter in color had evidently discharged 

 most of their secretion. The rather small oval nucleus, N., lies 

 near the base of the cell, not far above the basal process. 



Alternating with the gland cells are the small ciliated supporting 

 cells, fig. 32, S. C. They have a small cell body, about .004 mm. 

 in width, on a very long stalk, St., the basal ends of which are 

 inserted into the basement membrane. The cilia are short and 

 their structure could not be determined. A surface view of these 

 cells shows that there is one stout cilium in the middle of the cell, 

 while the other more slender ones are arranged in a ring around 

 the periphery of the upper surface. The stouter cilium may occa- 

 sionally be seen in sections, and then appears slightly longer than 

 the peripheral ones. A few small interstitial connective tissue 




710 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF ,' [DeC. , 



cells are present among the bases of the gland and supporting 

 cells, and are demonstrable chiefly by their nuclei. 



The basement membrane of the stomach rests directly upon the 

 inner longitudinal muscle of the body wall. The stomach is fre- 

 quently greatly flattened by the pressure exerted by the expanded 

 rhynchocoel. For the study of this region, a specimen from which 

 tlie proboscis has been cast out is the most favorable. 



The middle intestine, M.I., according to definition, begins with 

 the first pair of lateral intestinal ca^ca, but the cells that are pecu- 

 liarly characteristic of the middle intestine are not found in the 

 most anterior cteca or pouches, which are lined by cells similar to 

 those of the stomach. In other words, the most anterior pouches 

 of the middle intestine belong histologically to the stomach. 



The transition from the gland cells and ciliated supporting cells, 

 exactly similar to those of the stomach, that are found in the 

 most anterior pouches, to the absorptive cells characteristic of the 

 middle intestine is a very gradual one, and varies in different in- 

 dividuals. In some specimens the transition begins in the second 

 pair of cseca, in others it takes place farther back. There is no 

 abrupt line where gland cells end and absorptive cells begin, like 

 the sharp line between the end of the resophagus and the beginning 

 of the stomach, but the gland cells and their companion support- 

 ing cells gradually become less numerous and are replaced by the 

 absorptive cells that belong to the middle intestine. Throughout 

 the course of the middle intestine, here and there are found gland 

 cells, fig. 34, Gl.-i,, just like those of the stomach and the anterior 

 pouches. 



It is the presence of these gland cells, characteristic of the 

 stomach, in the anterior pouches and scattered through the rest of 

 the middle intestine, that has led me to believe that probably the 

 stomach and the middle intestine have a common origin from the 

 entoderm. The fact that there is not a well-defined histological 

 dividing line between the cell elements of the two regions, but a 

 gradual replacement of the gland cells by the absorptive cells, is in 

 confirmation of this opinion. And furthermore, to return to the 

 differences between (esophagus and stomach, here we do find a 

 sharply defined and sudden transition from an epithelium resem- 

 bling that of the outside of the body to a truly glandular epithe- 

 lium; also, the opening to the stomach provided with a primitive 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 711 



valvular fold. Here is certainly the division line between ectoder- 

 mal and entodermal derivatives. 



The characteristic absorptive cells of the middle intestine, fig. 

 34, Abs.C, are long slender cells, about .11 mm. high, rather 

 flattened at the base and inserted by slender lateral processes into 

 the basement membrane, B.M., and bearing several very long cilia, 

 Cil., on the distal surface. The cilia are about as long as the cell, 

 and are inserted on a basal knob. The nucleus is rather elon- 

 gate, and is situated near the base of the cell. The cell contents 

 are of a variable nature; usually the cell is filled with a finely 

 granular pink -staining substance, haematoxylin-eosin stain, in 

 which are numerous spherical masses that staiu a dark red. Other 

 cells present a vacuolated appearance, as if filled with a foamy 

 fluid substance. Since the function of these cells is absorption, 

 the different appearance of the contents should correspond to the 

 difierent stages in the absorptive process. Throughout the greater 

 part of the middle intestine the cells are swollen with the food con- 

 tents, and so closely pressed together that it is impossible to make 

 out the details of a single cell. All cell walls have apparently 

 disappeared, and the result is a chaotic mass of cytoplasm filled 

 with globules and granules of food, bordered by cilia on the side 

 toward the intestinal lumen, and with a row of nuclei along the 

 base, above the basement membrane. 



The gland cells that have been mentioned as occurring occa- 

 sionally in the middle intestine, fig. 31, Gl.^, cannot be distin- 

 guished from the absorptive cells — except by their absence of cilia — 

 iu preparations stained with iron-ha?matoxylin, since with this stain 

 both the secretion globules and the absorptive particles stain black. 

 With the hxmatoxylin-eosin stain, however, the differences are 

 strongly brought out, the food granules staining a brighter red, 

 and having a different degree of refraction from that of the gland- 

 ular secretion globules. 



It has already been mentioned that the 'two anterior pouches 

 consist of dififerent histological elements from the subsequent ones. 

 They are also somewhat smaller and are deflected slightly forward 

 (see fig. 1). In the more anterior part of the middle intestine, the 

 caeca are but little deeper than the axial part of the canal, but 

 farther back the cseca increase in depth at the expense of the axial 

 portion. 




712 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



In the breeding season, when the gonads are swollen and en- 

 larged, the intestinal caeca are under such pressure that their 

 opposite walls are frequently in contact. Wilson (1900) believes 

 that the lateral caeca do not function under these conditions, and 

 quotes the statement of M'Intosh (1873), that " the glandular 

 elements in the wall of the digestive tract undergo a certain 

 amount of atrophy during the period of reproductive perfection." 

 Wilson adds, in respect to Cerebratulus lacteiis, p. 115: " For a 

 long time, therefore, these intestinal pouches can function very 

 little, if at all, and so they contribute nothing to the nourishment 

 of the body." I should be unwilling to state that the lateral 

 pouches in Zi/geupoUa take no part in the absorption of food, for 

 I have found some cells of the lateral caeca that evidently con- 

 tained food vacuoles, in spite of the fact that the caecum was 

 greatly pressed by the adjoining gonads; but the cells of the caeca 

 are certainly under great disadvantages at this period. 



Toward the posterior end of the body (see fig. 17), the lateral 

 caeca decrease more and more in size, until finally the intestine is 

 once more a simple tube, Plate XLI, fig. 26, E.I. This portion 

 of the alimentary tract is variously termed the "anal portion of 

 the intestine," the " end intestine" ("Enddarm," Burger) and 

 the "rectum" (Coe, 1895 a). 



The end intestine, as it will here be termed, in Zygeupolla is 

 about .8 mm. long. The cells are the same absorptive cells that 

 are found in the middle intestine, with an occasional gland cell, so 

 that histologically the end intestine is the same as the middle intes- 

 tine, and may be regarded as merely the terminal portion of that 

 region. 



At the junction of the caudicle and body, fig. 27, the intestine 

 curves dorsally and opens, by the anus, to the exterior on the dor- 

 sal surface of the body. The anal opening, fig. 17,.^., is small, 

 and the edges are clothed with cilia. 



10. The Reproductive Systk:m. — Zygeupolia is dioecious. 

 The gonads, figs. 1, 24, 25, are found between the pouches of 

 the middle intestine, raetamerically arranged, throughout its 

 length, the first pair of gonads occurring between the first and 

 second pairs of intestinal caeca, and so on regularly, the gonad of 

 one side lying between two consecutive intestinal caeca, and oppo- 

 site to its fellow of the other side. Near tlie end of the middle

intestine, about 7 mm. anterior to the anus (see fig. 17), where 

 the cseca become more ami more shallow and finally disappear 

 altogther, leaving (he simple tube of the end intestine, the gonads 

 terminate (cf. fig. 26). 



Tlie Testis. — The testis is a simple sac, the wall consisting of a 

 one-celled layer of large, rather flattened cells with prominent 

 nuclei. In cross section, Plate XLI, fig. 24, the wall of the gonad 

 appears like a membrane, along which the nuclei are placed; in tan- 

 gential section, Plate XLIII, fig. 53, the cells appear elongated, 

 dovetailing into one another, with strong cell walls which are wavy 

 in outline, and granular cytoplasm that stains pink with the hajma- 

 toxylin-eosin stain. Each testis has a single duct, figs. 24, 55, T.d., 

 opening on the dorsal surface of the body, very near the side of the 

 rhynchocwl. The duct passes dorsally from the testis through the 

 inner longitudinal and circular muscle layers, and then expands into 

 a bulb-like portion with slightly thickened walls, fig. 55, b, and again 

 narrows before opening to the exterior. The duct meets the body 

 epithelium at the surface, and no bending in of the latter has been 

 observed. 



The youngest male cells are found at the margin of the testis, 

 attached by their bases to the gonad walls, figs. 24, 57. The 

 youngest cells are the largest — .023 mm. long, .005 mm. wide. 

 They are rather pear-shaped cells, fig. 57, with the distal end rounded 

 and the basal end prolonged into a slender stalk. The nuclei, 

 N., are large, with a jirominent chromatin reticulum and one 

 nucleolus, n. The cytoplasm is finely granular and no cell mem- 

 branes are present. From their size it is probable that these cells 

 are spermatogonia. They 'form a layer, one or two deep, around 

 the periphery of the testis, and are occasionally found far in toward 

 the middle. 



On the median side of the spermatogonia comes a zone of smaller 

 cells, arranged in radial rows. These are probably spermatocytes. 

 Many of them are in division stages, and the tiny spindles are very 

 <listinct, but are too minute for any exact study. 



In the innermost part of the testis the spermatozoa, Plate XLI, 

 fig. 24, Spz., are found, and near them very small cells that are no 

 doubt the spermatids. The spermatozoa are about .06 mm. long, 

 and three parts may be distinguished in them, the head, the middle 

 piece and the tail, Plate XLIII, figs. 58, 59. The head is longer 




714 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. , 



than wide, and is slightly broader at its posterior end. It stains 

 deep black with iron-hsematoxylin, and blue with hsematoxylin-eosin. 

 In some iron-hsematoxylin preparations that had been strongly de- 

 stained, the head appeared ashy gray with a minute black point at 

 the tip, fig. .58. The middle piece, m. 6. , is a four-lobed ftructure. 

 In fig. 59 there is a middle piece that has been detached from a 

 spermatozoan and which resembles four small spheres. In side view 

 only two of the lobes are seen. The middle piece stains black with 

 iron-hsematoxylin, and red with hcematoxylia-eosin. The tail is a 

 slender filament, in which no structure could be made out, many 

 times longer than the head. 



The Ovary. — The wall of the ovary, like that of the testis, is a 

 flattened epithelium, fig. 54, Gon. W. 



No ovarian duct has been found, although several specimens of 

 different ages have been examined. It is possible that a duct may 

 form in an older stage than those studied, but it seems more prob- 

 able that the eggs are discharged by rupture of the wall. The 

 latter view is supported by the fact of the difficulty in keeping 

 the body wall intact while studying living females with large 

 ova. When a perfect specimen was placed on a slide with sea 

 water and covered, a method that was repeatedly used without 

 difficulty for males, and for females with smaller ova, the posterior 

 part of the body would almost invariably fragment. It was also 

 difficult to fix and harden a mature female without rupturing the 

 body wall. No especial importance was attached to these facts at 

 the time, but since finding from the study of sections that there is 

 no preformed ovarian duct, I am inclined to believe that the 

 fragmentation observed in the female specimens was caused by the 

 rupture of the body wall above the gonads, the break then extend- 

 ing farther around the body wall. 



Closely pressed against the wall of the ovary and attached to it 

 by their broad bases arc (he youngest egg cells." Fig. 54 is a cross 

 section of a portion of the wall of one of the youngest ov^aries. 

 Although most of the smallest ova are distinct cells, here and there 

 several are seen, so close together that their boundaries cannot be 

 distinguished, and it is therefore probable that the ova arise from a 



'"As all the material examined was quite advanced in age, I have had no 

 opportunity to study the youngest stages of the ova, so tliat therefore the 

 cells that are here describe I as tlie youngest are probably well on in their 

 development. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 715 



cell syncytium. The smaOest separate egg cells, 0.„ are rather 

 square, having as yet no stalk. The cytoplasm is clear and slightly 

 granular, with no yolk granules, and there is a delicate cell mem- 

 brane. The nucleus is round, about .00-58 mm. in diameter; a 

 small nucleolus is present, but no chromatin is demonstrable, proba- 

 bly on account of admixture with plastiu, and the whole nucleus 

 takes a plasma stain, pink with hsematoxylin-eosin. 



In the next stage, the young ovum, O.,, has lengthened, the 

 distal end is somewhat rounded and the jiroximal end more 

 slender, so that the whole cell is now pear-shaped. The proximal 

 end constricts more and more until it becomes a slender stalk, by 

 which the rounded distal end or cell body remains attached to the 

 gonad wall. The nucleus has enlarged, measuring about .023 mm. 

 in diameter, likewise the nucleolus, in which scattered vacuoles are 

 forraiug. Yolk granules are beginning to appear in the cytoplasm. 



After the appearance of the yolk the cytoplasm has quite a 

 different look, being denser with the fine yolk granules scattered 

 throughout. The nucleus of this stage, O.3, is much larger, .035 

 mm. The nucleolus has not increased much in size, but the small 

 scattered vacuoles have fused into one large disk-shaped vacuole, 

 n.vac, at the periphery of the nucleolus. 



The ovum is now surrounded by two egg membranes, the outer 

 of which, o.O.mb., is considerably thicker than the inner and 

 stains blue, while the inner takes a faint pink, hsematoxylin-eosin 

 stain. The formation of the egg membranes has not been fol- 

 lowed with any exactness, but I believe that both membranes are 

 formed by the egg. B5hmig (1898) believes this is the case in 

 Stichodemmn (jvucense. Montgomery (1695) states that in S. 

 eilhardi only the inner egg membrane is a " yolk membrane," the 

 outer being derived from the germinal epithelium and is therefore 

 a true chorion. 



The oldest stage found, figs. 25, 52, is that of a free ovum in 

 the centre of the gonad, no longer attached to the wall by its 

 stalk. Both membranes are present, the outer one, tig. 52, 

 0. O.inb., being often broken and discontinuous, as if it were about 

 to be sloughed off. This appearance, however, may be an artifact, 

 as the specimen from which it is drawn was badly shrunken. At 

 this stage the gonad contains twenty or more ova of equal size, in 

 such close contact with each other that they assume a polygon.ll 




716 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



form. This is seen in fig. 56, a slightly younger stage, drawn 

 from life. It is likely that several or many ova ripen in one gonad 

 at once, and not one at a time as in many Nemerteans. 



The cytoplasm of this oldest stage stains a bright pink with the 

 hsematoxylin-eosin stain, and is charged with yolk; the nucleus is 

 very large, its diameter being about half that of the cell, the greater 

 part of its contents still taking the plasma stain. The nucleolus is 

 either one large rounded body, usually j^laced peripherally, or it is 

 broken up into numerous small fragments, which lie around the 

 periphery near the nuclear membrane, fig. 61, n. Several vacuoles 

 of varying size are present in the nucleolus. 



The attempt has been made to determiue whether there is any 

 priority in the ripening of the sexual products of either end of 

 the body. No difference in the respective ages of the gonads of the 

 two ends has been observed in the specimens studied. In any one 

 immature gonad different stages may be found, the youngest cells 

 lying peripherally, attached to the gonad wall, the older cells 

 ■toward the centre and free. 



11. The Caudicle. — -The caudicle, a term suggested by Mont- 

 gomery (1897 a) as a translation of Biirger's "Schwiinzchen," may 

 be defined as the slender, thread-like process at the posterior end of 

 the body of certain Heteronemerteans." 



The caudicle of Zygeupolia in life, figs. 4, 5, 6, appears as a 

 slender white filament, and a low magnification reveals a ciliated 

 surface and what seems to be a quite regular segmentation. A 

 closer examination, however, shows that the apparent annular 

 constrictions are merely the result of muscular contractions, and 

 are constantly varying in size and position. A light area along 

 the mid-line, bordered by denser areas, indicates the presence of a 

 central cavity — the blood lacuna. 



In connection with the caudicle, a description of the position of 

 the organs in the extreme posterior end of the body may be of 

 interest. The division of the dorsal blood vessel into two has 

 already been mentioned, and the subsequent fusion of the four 

 vessels into a central blood space; the termination of the rhyn- 

 choccel; the disappearance of the gonads and the dorsal opening of 

 the anus. A short distance in front of the anus the lateral nerves 



" It will be shown in the historical review of the literature of the candicle, 

 tHat the strnctnre described as a caudicle by Montgomery (1897 a) is in 

 realitj' a regenerating posterior end. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 717 



assume a more ventral position, finally lying on the ventral surface 

 of the body, Plate XLI, fig. 27. In this position they pass over 

 into the caudicle. In the caudicle, fig. 28, C.L.X., the nerves lie 

 latero-ventrally, and extend to the posterior end. 



The transition from the end of the body to the caudicle is also 

 marked by the sudden disappearance of the cutis and outer longi- 

 tudinal muscle layer. This is seen in fig. 27, a slightly oblique 

 cross section, that passes through the wall of the body dorsally and 

 the wall of the caudicle ventrally. 



A cross section through the caudicle, fig. 28, shows tliat it is 

 a hollow tube with the following structure: (1) the epithelium, 

 (2) the two lateral nerves in the epithelium, (3) the circular mus- 

 cle, (4) the inner longitudinal muscle, and (5) mesenchyme cells 

 bordering on the central blood space. 



The epithelium is composed of ciliated supporting cells, fig. 12, 

 "S. C, very similar to those of the body, but with a smaller cell body 

 and longer stalk (cf. figs. 2 and 12) ; large gland cells, fig. 11, lying 

 mostly on the dorsal surface, the secretion staining red with eosin, 

 with very large nuclei at the base and abundant cytoplasm enclosing 

 the secretion; and very numerous interstitial connective tissue cells 

 between the bases of the epithelial cells, above the basement 

 membrane. The epithelium of the caudicle as a whole is slightly 

 higher than that of the body, measuring about .04 mm. in height. 

 The nuclei of the connective tissue cells, fig. 28, Ca.T.N., are so 

 prominent and the cells so numerous that the efliect is like that of 

 undifferentiated tissue. Biirger'' (1895), p. 239, says in this con- 

 nection: " Es Uisst der Reichthum an Kernen wohl keinen an- 

 deren Schluss zu, als dass die Zellelemente der Gewebsschichten 

 und des Parenchyms des Schwiinzchens im Vergleich zu denen des 

 Korpers ganz ausserordentlich klein sind." 



The lateral nerves, fig. 28, C.L.N. , lie in the epithelium outside 

 the circular muscle layer, latero-ventral in position. No ganglion 

 cells could be detected around the fibrous core. The circular muscle 

 layer, CM., is reduced to a very thin layer of two or three fibres; 

 the longitudinal muscle, i.L.M., is also a layer of but little thick- 

 ness. The central blood space, Bl.L., is bordered by scattered 

 mesenchym cells, mes., large pear-shaped cells, attached at first to 

 the muscular wall, but later floating freely in the lacuna. 



'■ For the sake of clearness the great numbers of the connective tissue cells 

 in the epidermis are not represented in fig. 28. 




718 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



It is thus seen that the caudicle of Zygeupolia is a structure 

 from which many organs of the body are absent, namely: the ali- 

 mentary canal, the gonads, the rhynchocoel, the outer longitudinal 

 muscle layer and the cutis. 



The significance of the caudicle, however, is not clear, and 

 several explanations may be suggested : (1) The caudicle has 

 remained in a simple, primitive or embryonic condition, while the 

 rest of the body has become differentiated. 



(2) The caudicle is a degenerate structure, the degeneration of 

 certain organs having begun at the posterior end and continued 

 gradually forward. 



(3) The caudicle is a cronogenetic structure, with a certain 

 physiological function. 



Of these views, no positive proof can be brought forward in 

 regard to the first two. The varying complexity of the caudicles 

 of different genera — for example, that of Zygeupolia and the caudi- 

 cle described by Burger (1895) for Cerebratulns viarginatm, con- 

 taining all the organs of the posterior end of the body — might sup- 

 port the view of degeneracy, but this argument may hardly be 

 used until we know more of the origin and phylogeny of the cau- 

 dicle. 



It seems much more probable that the caudicle of the Nemer- 

 teans has arisen cojnogenetically, and an explanation of its mode 

 of origin has been suggested by the comparison with a Khabdocoel 

 Turbellarian, Macrostoma hi/strix Oe., described by Graff (1882), 

 and figured on Taf. IV, Fig. 1. In this worm the posterior end is 

 expanded laterally and provided with abundant gland cells, making 

 an adhesive surface. Graff says, p. 240, the bod}' is " hinten in 

 einen platten spatelformig erweiterten Schwanz ausgezogen." It 

 would not be difficult to imagine this posterior end becoming elon- 

 gated and more slender, until it is finally a thin filament. In a 

 similar way the Xomertean caudicle may have arisen from a pos- 

 terior end, originally differentiated as an adhesive surface. The 

 observations of Johannes Miiller (1854) and M'Intosh (1869) 

 show that at the present time the end of the caudicle frequently 

 acts as a sucker. 



M'Intosh (1869) believes that the central space in the caudicle 

 of Micrura purpurea is connected with the circulatory system. 

 This, as stated above, is certainly true in Zygeupolia. The fact 




1901.] NATURAL SCIEXCE3 OF PHILADELPHIA. 719 



that the large blood lacuna occupies the entire space within the 

 muscular wall of the caudicle of Zijgetipolia, and that the mesen- 

 chym — blood-forming — cells are very abundant, suggests that one 

 function of the caudicle may be the formation of new blood cells. 

 This, however, also takes place throughout the blood vessels of the 

 body. The large blood lacuna of the caudicle is probably a 

 means of aerating the blood, making respiration another possible 

 function of this problematical structure. 



Literature of the Caudicle. — The caudicle has been known in 

 literature under various other names, and considerable confusion 

 has arisen from the multiplication of terms, and from the fact that 

 the caudicle, which is an adult structure, has been confounded 

 with the regenerating " papilla" so frequently found at the poste- 

 rior end of Xemerteans that have been broken. 



For this reason an account of the history and synonymy of the 

 caudicle and the differences between the true caudicle and the 

 regenerating posterior end will be given, at perhaps greater length 

 than the importance of this small structure demands. 



The following papers will be separated under two headings I, 

 those describing the true caudicle; II, those in which other struc- 

 tures have been mistaken for the true caudicle." 



I. Ehrenberg and Hemprich (1831) describe the new genus 

 Micrura with " anus sub cauda," and Micrura faseiolata nov. 

 sp., " . . . . anus terminalis sub processu caudali parvo, albo." 



Busch (1851) (cited by J. Miiller, 1854) mentions and figures, 

 Taf. II, Fig. 8, a Nemertean with a caudicle (" Schwanzan- 

 hang"). The worm is described under the name of Alardus 

 caudatiis. 



Diesing (1851) refers to Micrura Hemp, et Ehr. = Nemertes 

 Oersted, as with a " processu terminali posiico filiformi brevis- 

 simo. " He describes the new species Meckelia Knerii Diesing, 

 " corpus depressum retrorsum parum augustatum processu brevis- 

 simo fiiiformi. " 



Dalyell (1853), Vol. II, (cited by Krohn, 1858), describes 

 under the name Gordius four Nemerteans that would now be 



" In this review of the history of the caudicle some of the earliest and 

 some of the most important papers in Nemenean literature are referred to, 

 but no attempt has been made to give a complete list of all the observations 

 on the subject. 




720 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



recognized as Micrune. They are G. viridis spinifer, G. j)urpurciis 

 spinifer, G. fragilis spinifer and G. fasciatns spinifer. 



Johannes Miiller (1854) reports finding a young worm within 

 the larva Pilidium fjyrans, and also others in the water which 

 have a " Schwanzanhang, " and resemble the Alardas caudatus 

 Busch. The latter is figured, after Busch, on Taf. IV, Fig. 2. 

 Miiller says " Mit dem Schwanzanhang kann sich das Thierchen 

 auf dem Glase anhalten und wie lestleimen und ist dann schwer 

 von der SteUe zu bringen." He believes that the young worm 

 within the larva, resembling the Alardus of Busch, is the same as 

 Mierura fasciolata Ehr. et Hemp. Miiller also quotes a letter 

 from A. Krohn, dated November 19, 1851, in which Krohn speaks 

 of finding at Naples a young worm within the Pilidium fjyrans: 

 " Der Leib desselben ist Jilnglich oval, nach vorn zu etwas ver- 

 schmiichtigt. Mitten am hinteren Ende findet sich ein ganz kurzer 

 cylindrischer Anhang, der dureh wenige aufeinander folgende 

 Querwiilste wie gegliedert erscheint. Die Oberfliiche des Leibes, 

 so wie auch die des Anhanges ist wie bei den Turbellarien dicht 

 mit schwingenden Cilieu besetzt. " 



Krohn (1858), referring to the young worm within ihe. Pilidium 

 gyrans, says: " In Helgoland sah ich 1854 mehrere arten von 



Pilidium Der Schwanzanhang wird an den mehrsten 



Nemertinen von Pilidien beobachtet, und wird nur selten ver- 



misst Die Nemertinen mit Schwanzanhang gehoren zu 



der Gattung Mierura Ehr., 'W omit Alardus Busch identisch ist." 

 On p. 300, Krohn gives a list of the Mierurce found in the North 

 Sea, and an account of the synonymy of the genus. 



Leuckart (1858) summarizes the work done on Neraerteans. 

 On p. 186 he mentions the " Auwesenheit eines retractilen Schwanz- 

 fadens " in a Nemertean. 



Leuckart and Pagenstecher (1858) describe a new Pilidium, 

 P. aurieulatum : " Ein Schwanzfortsatz, wie er so hiiufig bei den 

 in Pilidien gebildeten Nemertinen gefunden wird und nach J. 

 Miiller auch bei dem Sprosslinge eines Helgoliinder Pilidium 

 vorkommt, fehJt unserm Thier. " 



Metschnikoff (18(Ja) mentions the presence of a caudicle on the 

 young worm within the pilidium. This is figured on Taf. X, 

 Fig. 15. On p. 55 he says: " Es bildet sich am Ilinterrande der 

 jungen Nemertinc ein kleines konisches Schwiiuzchen, welches 




1901.] NATUKAL BCliJNC'KS OF PHIL,ADJ!iL,±'HlA. 721 



einen einfachen Auswuchs der Korperwaud darstellt, uad wie 

 diese mit Flimmerhaaren bedeckt erscheint. " 



M'Intosh (1869) describes the following structure: " The pos- 

 terior end of the body in Micrura {Stylm) requires special mention, 

 since there is superadded a peculiar elongated and contractile style. 

 This appendage seems to be formed by a prolongation of the cuta- 

 neous and part of the muscular (longitudinal and circular) textures 

 of the body wall of the animal. The entire organ in contraction 

 has a granular appearance, the coarsest granules and occasionally 

 a few circular masses of brownish pigment, being at the tip. 

 Within these coats is a circular chamber, which undergoes various 

 alterations, in size, and contains a transparent fluid. This cavity 

 is not connected with the digestive tract, which opens by a termi- 

 nal pore at the base of the process, nor can proboscidian discs be 



seen therein its connection with the circulatory [system] 



appears most probable." 



M'Intosh (1874) says that the genus Micrura has " a soft fili- 

 form caudal process, capable of attachment." He further alludes 

 to " a pale caudal filament" and " a slender styliform process 

 attached to the tail " which " can be elongated to an extreme 

 degree. ' ' 



Hubrecht (1887) used the term " caudal papilla " throughout 

 his description of the caudicle. 



Verrill (1893), in defining the genus J/ierura, says: " Poste- 

 rior end of the body provided with a median slender cirrus, above 

 the anus. This genus, as here defined, differs from Lineus in little 

 else than the presence of a well-marked contractile anal cirrus, 

 which may often be distinguished even in alcoholic specimens. 

 From Cerebratulus, which also has the anal cirrus, it differs in the 

 form and muscular structure of the body posteriorly." In other 

 parts of this work the terms " anal papilla," " caudal papilla " 

 and " caudal filament " are indiscriminately used. 



Verrill (1895) employs the expression " caudal cirrus." 



Biirger (1895) describes " ein diinnes 5-15 mm. langes, meist 

 borstenartig starres, weissliches Anhiingsel," which he terms " das 

 Schwauzchen." On p, 24, in reviewing the work of Dalyeli, 

 Biirger employs another term, saying that Dalyeli " den Appendix 

 beobachtet und gut gezeichnet hat." 

 46 




722 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



Coe (1895 a), in regard to Cerehratulus lacteu^, says : " The an^^s 

 is at the end of the body, just beneath the caudal papilla." 



Coe (1901) gives as one of the generic characters of Cerebratu- 

 bis, ". . . . the posterior end extremely flattened and provided 

 with a delicate caudal cirrus, which extends beyond the opening 

 of the intestine." 



Wilson C. B. (1900) uses Hubrecht's term "anal papilla" 

 for the caudicle of Cerebratulus lacteus. 



Punnett (1900) speaks of a " caudal appendage." 



II. O. F. Muller (1788) describes and figures, p. 38, tab.. 68, 

 figs. 18, 20, a Planaria filans : " Planaria linearis cauda filiformi 

 contractili." The length of the " cauda filiformis contractilis " 

 in fig. 20, equal to the length of the body, suggests the thought 

 that it may be the evaginated proboscis. Burger (1895), p. 8, 

 says that this worm is probably a Tetrastemma. 



Grube (1855) describes two new species of Meckelia. The 

 first, M. annulata, resembles the M. Knerii Diesing. Grube 

 thinks that the " processus terminalis " described by Diesing is more 

 probably a regenerating end; he says: " Der processus brevissimus 

 filiformis konnte ein reproducirtes noch junges Schwanzende sein." 

 The second species, M. aurantlaca, has the following character- 

 istics: " Der Korper verschmalert sich nach hinten sehr allmiih- 

 lich, und endete bei einem Exemplare in ein viel diinneres, war- 

 scheinlich vor kurzera reproducirtes Schwiinzchen." 



Montgomery (1897 a), Taf. 2, Fig. 16, has described as a cau- 

 dicle what is evidently a regenerating posterior end." The char- 

 acters that make the structure described by Dr. Montgomery in 

 Cerebratulus lacteus, and figured by him on Taf. 2, Fig. 16, a 

 regenerating posterior end rather than a true caudicle are (1) the 

 size, (2) the presence of the alimentary canal, (3) the presence 

 of the outer longitudinal muscle layer, and (4) the presence of the 

 three distinct blood vessels with definite walls. 



The chief external differences between the true caudicle and the 

 regenerating papilla of Cerebratulus lacteus are in size and general 



" My attention was called to this error by Dr. Montgomery himself, who 

 has suggesleil th;it it be rectified. Dr. Montgomery has kindly lent me his 

 own prepiraiions upon which the ob-'ervations were made, .so that I have 

 been able to CDmpare them with slides of my own, made from a Cerebratu- 

 lus lacteus found in life with a good-sized regenerating papilla, which bore a 

 short caudicle at its posterior end.

appearance. The true caudicle is slender and thread-like, contrac- 

 tile and usually twisted; the regenerating papilla is stouter and 

 rod-like, and does not twist and contract like the caudicle. C. B. 

 Wilson (1900) contrasts the two structures as follows. On p. 

 116, alluding to the regenerating end, he says: " Such a papilla 

 is slender and almost pure white in colour. At first it it is difficult 

 to distinguish it from the true anal papilla with which the body 

 normally terminates, but it may be recognized by the fact that it 

 always possesses a very broad base which fades gradually into the 

 body wall, while the anal papilla is narrow and ends abruptly at 

 the emargination. ' ' 



The papilla on the Cerehraiulus found by the writer was about 7 

 mm. long, light in color and rather rounded, not yet having assumed 

 the typical flattened shape of the body. At its posterior end a 

 short, but in all respects a true caudicle was borne. A cross sec- 

 tion through this true caudicle shows that it consists merely of a 

 thin body wall enclosing a central blood space. The body wall is 

 composed of the epidermis, in which tiie two lateral nerves lie, and 

 of the circular and inner longitudinal muscle layers. The blood 

 lacuna has no definite lining, but is bordered by numerous mesen- 

 chym cells. From the caudicle of Cerebratulus lacteus. like that 

 of Zygeupolia, the alimentary canal, the gonads and the rhyn- 

 chocoel are absent. 



A cross section through the regenerating papilla of my Cerebra- 

 tulus has the same structure that is found in the section figured by 

 Dr. Montgomery. The outer longitudinal muscle layer and the 

 alimentary canal are present, and three blood vessels — one dorsal 

 and two lateral — instead of the central blood lacuna. This proves 

 finally that the structure observed by Dr. Montgomery is a regen- 

 erating posterior end and not a caudicle. 



In both worms the end of the body tapers quite gradually into 

 the regenerating portion, and it would be difficult to say where the 

 old tissue ends and the new begins, as differentiation has evidently 

 gone on for some time in the anterior part of the new tissue. The 

 most posterior sections of Dr. Montgomery's worm show that a 

 true caudicle had likewise begun to form there, but had subse- 

 quently been broken off just at its base. It is seen from the meas- 

 urements of the two worms that there is an abrupt change iu size 

 between the end of the body proper and the caudicle, the caudicle

measuring less than half the width of the bodj'. The diminution 

 in size is due to the sudden disappearance of the outer longitudinal 

 muscle layer, and to the ending of the alimentary canal with the 

 body. 



A word must be said here in regard to the relative position of 

 the anus and the caudicle. 



Yerrill (1893) states that the caudicle of the genus Mierura is 

 above the anus, and Coe (1895) says the same in regard to Cere- 

 bratulus lacteus. From my study of sections of Miorura cceca and 

 Cerebratulus lacteus I find that the anus undoubtedly opens dor- 

 sally above the caudicle. Nothing is easier than to confuse the 

 dorsal and ventral surfaces of a living worm, but in serial sections, 

 with definite structures for orientation, there can be no such diffi- 

 culty. The anus in Zygeupolia likewise opens dorsally above the 

 caudicle, and Burger (1895) states that the dorsal position of the 

 anus is usual in Nemerteans. From these data it seems likely that 

 a thorough investigation of all species with caudicles will prove that 

 the dorsal position of the anus is of general occurrence. 



Burger (1895), p. 238, says in regard to the caudicle of Cerebra- 

 tulus, Mierura and Langia: " ISIorphologiscli stellt das Schwiinz- 

 chen uiehts anderes dar als das stark und meist plotzlich verjiingte 

 hintere Korperende, in das sich von Organen der Darmtractus, 

 die drei Blutgefiissstiirame, die Genitaltaschen und die Seiten- 

 stiirame fortsetzten, und in welchem wir auch alle Schichten der 

 Korperwand bis auf die Cutis, welche giinzlich verschwunden oder 

 in ihrer Ausbildung fast unterdriickt ist, autreffen." According 

 to this all the organs of the posterior part of the body are repre- 

 sented in the " Schwiinzchen," except the rhynchoca'l, and even 

 this organ, Biirger states, is present in the anterior part of the 

 caudicle of Cerebratulus marginatum. 



The observations of M'Intosh (1869) in regard to Mierura 

 purpurea, those of Yerrill (1893) on the whole genus Mierura, 

 and my own upon M. cceca are contradictory to the above state- 

 ment of Burger. In like manner Coe's work upon the American 

 species of Cerebratulus and my own upon the one species Cerebra- 

 tulus lacteus show that the caudicles of these forms cannot be 

 regarded as merely " verjungte hintere Korperenden." From the 

 very limited space devoted to the subject of the caudicle in Burger's 

 great monograph, it is likely that his study of this structure was 




lyOl.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 725 



hasty, aud the question has arisen in my mind, could Burger have 

 mistaken a regenerating posterior end for a true caudicle ? 



Witliout wishing to criticise the statement of this distinguished 

 investigator, it seems probable that a further investigation of the 

 candicles of the European species of Micrura and Cerebratulus 

 will result in an agreement with the structure of the American 

 species. 



III. Parasites. 



A monocystid Gregarine in its adult form is frequently present 

 in the middle intestine of Zygeupolia. Large cysts, surrounded 

 by a thick cuticle and containing various developing stages, are also 

 found in the intestine. From their proximity to the adult Grcga- 

 rines, and from their resemblance to the stages figured by different 

 authors, it seems likely that these are Gregarine cysts. Outside 

 of the cyst, in the lumen of the intestine, are small amceboid 

 masses, resembling some of the stages within the cyst. These 

 amceboid masses also penetrate between or into the cells of the 

 intestinal wall and probably into the gonads. 



In some hving specimens large white spots may be noticed 

 among the gonads, fig. 6. They are so large that they are easily 

 seen with the unaided eye. They appear stalked, like the ova, and 

 have a large nucleus with one or more nucleoli. Fig. 56, a hori- 

 zontal optical section drawn from life, shows one of these structures 

 in a gonad together with several ova. In life the cytoplasm appears 

 denser and darker than that of the small ova, and the conclusion 

 first reached after studying these living bodies was that they were 

 the oldest, nearly mature ova. 



The examination of sections in which these large bodies are 

 present has shown that the first conckision was erroneous and 

 has proved that they are the encysted stages of some parasites 

 within the cytoplasm of the ovum. Fig. 60 is a transverse section 

 through the body wall and the wall of the gonad, showing the 

 cyst, surrounded by egg cytoplasm, cy., and attached to the 

 gonad wall, Gon. W. The cyst is surrounded by a striated cuticle, " 

 Ctl. , and outside the cuticle is a delicate membrane staining like 

 the cell membrane. In the cytoplasm of the base are two jegg 



'^The reference line from Ctl., fig. 60, only extends as far as the egg mem- 

 brane, instead of to the cuticle within. 




726 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



nuclei, N. The cytoplasm of the cyst lias a very different staining 

 reaction from that of the egg, staining a faint violet with hjema- 

 toxylin-eosin, and having a finely granular appearance. The 

 nucleus of the cyst, N.jmr., is irregular in outline, in some speci- 

 mens with amoeboid processes. It stains homogeneously a bright 

 red, hffimatoxylin-eosin, while the nucleoli are darker and fre- 

 quently vacuolated. 



The presence of the additional egg nuclei in the cytoplasm at 

 the base of the cyst render it probable that the parasite entered 

 the cytoplasm when the ovum was in a syncytium. The presence 

 of the parasite may have caused an abnormal growth of the egg 

 cytoplasm, or the latter may have merely expanded with the growth 

 of the cyst. In its appearance the cytoplasm around the cyst is 

 like that of the normal, uninfected eggs. 



Figs. 48, 61, show two infected egg cells from a different indi- 

 vidual, with amceboid, probably earlier stages of the parasite, 

 Par. In this particular worm almost every egg has been infected. 



As a rule, the gonads of the male specimens that were studied 

 were not infected, but in a few worms the testes contained large 

 bodies that were evidently parasites, and that resembled some of 

 the stages found in the ovaries. 



The relation, if any exists, between the amoeboid masses found 

 in the intestine and those within the egg cells has not as yet been 

 worked out, as it is not within the scope of the present paper, 

 but in consideration of the prominence of these parasites and of 

 their position in the ova, this brief description has been given. If 

 sufficient material can be obtained for the intermediate stages, this 

 subject may later be studied in detail. 



The presence of adult Gregarines in Nemerteans has been 

 known for a long time, and they are mentioned and described by 

 several of the earlier Nemertean writers — Frey and Leuckart 

 (1847), Kolliker (1848) and Johnston (1865), Appendix, p. 290. 



I have found no references in literature to any structures quite 

 similar to those found in the ova of Z>jgeupolia. M'Intosh (1867) 

 and Wheeler (1896) describe parasites that have a certain degree 

 of likeness. 



Jl'Intosh found adult Gregarines in Borlasia octoculata = Linens 

 saixjnincus and Borlada olivacea ^^ IJnem gesserensis. Besides 

 tlie !\dult Gregarines, M'Intosh found what he called " certain 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 727 



ova that accompany the Gregarines. " The "ova" measured 

 about iJir inch in diameter and each contained an "embryo" 

 that made evident movements. They have two coats, an inner 

 faintly striated and an external without markings. The con- 

 tained " embryo " is finely granular and has a large pale nucleus. 

 M'Intosh regards these "ova" as altogether difierent from the 

 true ova of the Borlada. 



Wheeler found in the body cavity of the Annelid Myzodoma 

 glahrum great numbers of amoeboid masses that he regards as pos- 

 sibly the young stages of some Gregarine. The body cavity was 

 distended with ova, and among them occurred the parasites. He 

 says: " In most cases the uniformly staining and rather shrunken 

 body of the parasite was produced into a long fine point which 

 had penetrated the cytoplasm of an ovum. In a few instances a 

 single amoeba had two points, each entering the body of an adja- 

 cent ovum (fig. 54). The cytoplasm of the ova thus attached 

 contained large granules which took up the hematoxylin with 

 avidity. These granules were larger and more numerous than 

 those which occur in normal ova of about the same size." The 

 amoebae are also found outside the ova. 



IV. General Conclusions. 



The description of the organs of Zygeupolia given in the ana- 

 tomical section of this paper makes it evident that this genus is a 

 primitive one and that it has affinities with both Proto- and Hetero- 

 nemerteans. 



The questions now to be discussed are (1) the relationship of 

 Zygeupolia to other orders, especially the Protonemerteans ; 

 (2) the position of Zygeupolia within its own order. 



The following characters undoubtedly entitle Zygeupolia to a 

 place in the order of the Heteronemerteans : the position of the 

 lateral nerves, outside the circular muscle layer; the presence of 

 the cutis and outer longitudinal muscle layer ; the situation of the 

 mouth behind the brain; the absence of stilets in the proboscis 

 and of a blind intestine. 



The alimentary system of Zygeupolia conforms with the general 

 Heterouemertean plan, which, however, is essentially the same as 

 that of the Mesonemerteans and such Protonemerteans as Cari- 

 nina and Hubrechtia. 




728 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



The blood system of Zygeupolia is of the Heteronemertean type, 

 Huhrechtia heing the only Protonemertean that approaches it ia 

 any way, namely, in the presence of a dorsal blood vessel. 



In the structure of the nervous system aud the cerebral sense 

 organs Zygeupolia is again a Heteronemertean ; but by no means 

 the highest type of brain or sense organ is represented, Zygeupolia 

 having a very simple Heteronemertean brain and cerebral sense 

 organ. 



The presence of muscular crosses in the proboscis and its general 

 structure are further characters in common with certain Hetero- 

 nemerteans. 



The absence of lateral slits is a primitive character, and one 

 common to all the Protonemerteans aud to the more primitive 

 Heteronemerteans. This character, as we know, is possessed 

 by Zygeupolia. The inner circular muscle layer of Zygeupolia is, 

 in my belief, a primitive character, and the short extent of the 

 layer is explicable on the grounds that the thickened region in 

 front of the middle intestine is only the remnant of a layer that 

 was once continuous throughout the body. 



The presence of this muscle layer in a limited region in Micrura 

 ccRca, and of a similar layer in M. alaskensis, Coe (1901), shows 

 that an inner circular muscle layer exists in two genera of the 

 Heteronemerteans. The dorso-ventral fibres of the Hetero- 

 nemerteans, regarded by Burger as derived from an inner circular 

 layer, and the so-called "oesophageal muscles" ("Darmmuscu- 

 latur" ) which, according to my view, are derived from the deflec- 

 tion and bending around of dorso-ventral fibres, are other evi- 

 dences of the remains of an inner circular muscle among the 

 Heteronemerteans. 



The lateral grooves of Zygeupolia, if they are sense organs, may 

 possibly be homologized with the side organs of Carinella. Their 

 position in the median lateral line of the bod}', and their charac- 

 ter as epithelial grooves, both agree with the side organs; but 

 until their undoubted sensory character is proved, the comparison 

 should not be emphasized. 



A brief summary of the structure of Zygeupolia shows that it is 

 a Heteronemertean, on account of the presence of the outer longi- 

 tudinal muscle layer, the position of the lateral nerves, the struc- 

 ture of the alimentary system, of the blood system, of the nervous 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 729 



system and cerebi-al sense organs, and of the proboscis; while the 

 affinities with the Protonemerteans — and certain Heteronemerteana 

 — are in the absence of lateral slits, in the presence of an inner cir- 

 cular muscle layer and of crosses between this layer and the outer 

 circular, and in the lateral grooves, if sense organs. 



The general simplicity of its Heteronemertean structure and the 

 several Protonemertean characters bring Zi/geupolia very near to 

 the Protonemerteans, and through Zyrjeupolia the whole Hetero- 

 nemertean order is more closely connected with the Protonemer- 

 teans. 



The question now arises, To which of the families of the Hetero- 

 nemerteans does Zijgeupolia belong — to the Eupoliida;, or to the 

 Lineida; ?" 



The chief characteristics of the two families will now be given, 

 according to Biirger (1895): 



The Eupoliidm. — (1) No lateral slits in the head, the cerebral 

 canal opening directly outward or into shallow ventral furrows. 



(2) No muscular crosses in the proboscis. 



(3) The proboscis musculature consists of two layers, an outer 

 circular and an inner longitudinal muscle layer. 



(4) A head gland is prominent, the gland cells reaching back 

 into the oesophageal region. 



The Lineidw. — (1) The canal of the cerebral organ opens 

 usually, not directly outward, but into deep, or sometimes shallow, 

 lateral slits in the head.'" 



(2) Two muscular crosses in the proboscis. 



(3) The proboscis musculatur consists of three layers — longitu- 

 dinal, circular and longitudinal muscle layers; if any one of these 

 layers is absent it is the inner longitudinal one. 



(4) The head gland is represented by a few gland cells, and 

 does not extend posterior to the brain. 



'' In my preliminary note upon Zygeupolia ''1900 a) this genus is placed 

 in the Eiipoliidse, on account of the absence of lateral slits and the supposed 

 absence of muscular crosses in the proboscis. As t have since found muscu- 

 lar crosses in the proboscis, I wish to correct this error. 



" Biirger's own words in regard to the lateral slits are here given (1895, 

 p. 613): "Der Canal des Cerebral organs miindet in der Kegel nicht direct 

 nach aussen, sondern in tiefe laterale horizontale Taschen, welche durch die 

 Kopfspalten gebildetslud. Die Koptspalten sind wechselnd tief : sie schnei- 

 den hiinfig bis auf das Him ein, aber sie sind auoh, obwohl in seltenen 

 Fallen, nur durch flache laterale Liingsbucljten angedeutet." 




730 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. , 



The Lineidse are subdivided iuto the Araicrurae, forms without 

 a caudicle, and the Micrura;, forms with a caudicle. 



Zyc/eupolia agrees with the above description of the Eupoliidte in 

 one point only, i.e., in the absence of lateral slits in the head. 

 The number of the muscle layers of the proboscis is Ihe same in 

 both, but the position of the layers is reversed in Zygeupolia, the 

 longitudinal muscle being the outer; the circular, when present, 

 the inner. It will be recalled that the circular layer is absent 

 from the " anterior region " of the proboscis of Zygeupolia. 



The structure of the proboscis musculature of the " middle 

 region" ia Zygeupolia agrees with what Biirger evidently regards 

 as the less common condition in the Lineidte, namely, in the 

 absence of the innermost of the three muscle layers. 



Muscular crosses are found in the proboscis of Zygeupolia ; but 

 this is a very variable character, for different individuals may 

 have a dorsal and ventral cross of equal size, a strong dorsal with 

 a faint ventral cross, or a dorsal cross only. 



The absence of a definite head gland and the presence of a cau- 

 dicle are common to both Zygeupolia and the Micruran Lineidse. 



The neurochord cells of Zygeupolia are an evidence of speciali- 

 zation, for hitherto these cells have been found only in highly 

 organized genera. 



It is evident that Zygeupolia agrees best with the exceptional 

 members of the Lineida; — i.e., with those Lineidse whose cerebral 

 canals open directly to the exterior, and from whose probosces 

 the inner longitudinal muscle layer is absent. 



When we therefore consider the position of Zygeupolia in 

 respect to the Eupoliidse and the Liueidte, it seems to belong 

 entirely to neither, but to have affinities with both. It possesses 

 the leading characteristic of the Eupoliidie, but all the other attri- 

 butes of that family are greatly modified. In general structure 

 Zygeupolia comes nearest to the Jlicruran Lineidiv, althougli it is 

 evident that it must be regarded as an aberrant member of that 

 family. 



But is Zygeupolia a retrograde member of the Lineidaj, or 

 merely a more simple, primitive form in process of becoming more 

 complex ? 



It is generally accepted that the Eupoliida3 are more primitive 

 than the Lineidx. Now Zygeupolia, in the absence of the lateral 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 731 



slits, possesses a character that is general in the Eupoliidse and 

 exceptional in the Lineidije; the number and arrangement of the 

 muscular layers of the proboscis make a second character only 

 occasional in the Lineid;e, and, finally, variations occur in the num- 

 ber of the proboscis crosses in Zygeupolia, a character that is con- 

 stant in the Lineidfe. Therefore Zygeupolia, with one primitive 

 character, a second corresponding to a reduced number of parts 

 in the Lineidre, and a third that varies in different individuals, 

 is undoubtedly a form in transitiou from a more simple and primi- 

 tive condition to a complex state. It may be regarded as the 

 most primitive member of the Lineidoe yet described." 



In general external characters, Zygeupolia comes nearer to the 

 genus Micrura than to any of the other genera of the Lineidse. 

 The generally small size, the body more or less rounded poste- 

 riorly and the presence of a caudicle are characters common to 

 both. To Micrura ca-ca, Zygeupolia bears a most striking resem- 

 blance in size, shape and color, and the two can scarcely be distin- 

 guished except with a hand lens, -which reveals the presence of 

 lateral slits in the former and their absence in the latter. 



The relation of the Heteronemerteans to the Protonemerteans 

 is an interesting question. The position of the lateral nerve 

 chords is relatively the same in both, the outer longitudinal muscle 

 layer of the Heteronemerteans being merely a later formation from 

 the ectoderm (Burger, 1894), and the cutis glands being formed 

 by the sinking beneath the surface of certain epithelial gland cells. 

 Lateral slits are absent among the more simple Eupoliidie, and I 

 hope to have shown in this paper that an inner circular muscle 

 layer, or its derivatives, is quite common among the Heterone- 

 merteans. 



It seems to me that the Heteronemerteans are very closely related 

 to the Protonemerteans, the Lineidas being connected by forms like 

 Zygeupolia, the Eupoliidte and Hubrechtia, and that the Metane- 

 merteans and the Mesonemertean Cephalothrix are widely divergent 

 forms. 



"Since the above was written the new Heteronemertean, J/icrf Ha n(/a 

 Pannett (1901 b), has been described as the most primitive member of the 

 Lineida?. But Zygeupolia, ia entering the family of the Lineidie, must 

 assume the lowest position until an even more primitive form is discoTtred. 

 Within the last few .years so many new Nemertean genera have been found 

 that we may look confidently /or further additions to the group. 




782 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. , 



In regard to Carinoma, I agree with the view recently advanced 

 by Bergendal (1900 b) that it is more of a Protonemerteati than 

 a Mesonemertean, for its points of agreement with the Protone- 

 merteans are far more numerous than with Cephalothrix. Bergen- 

 dal's suggestion to retain Hubrecht's broader order of the Falseo- 

 nemertiui, including the four families of the Carinellidoe, Carino- 

 midffi, Hubrechlidaj and Cephalothricida?, seems a very excellent 

 one. This suggestion is based upon a comparative study of Carinoma 

 and upon the discovery of the interesting form Callinera hurgeri, 

 a true Protonemertean, in which the cerebral organs are absent. 



In all zoology, as our knowledge advances and more and more 

 new forms are discovered, the gaps between old and once widely 

 separated families and groups are gradually filled and the results 

 tend toward a more elastic and broader classification. 



The view is held by some zoologists that the Nemerteans, on 

 account of their general uniformity, are a comparatively recent 

 group, so that a large number of the members are probably still in 

 existence. If this is true, we ma\' expect some day, when our 

 present species are better known and all the intermediate forms 

 have been added to them, to see our existing lines of classification 

 laid aside, and in their place one broad comprehensive group.

The following reports were ordered to be printed : 

 REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT. 



Upon the removal of the Academy to its present location iu 

 1876, the President, Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger, prepared a 

 brief history of the institution, with a summary of its collections 

 and publications, which appeared in the popular guide to the 

 Museum in that year. 



Subsequently throughout his term of office, Dr. Ruschenberger 

 presented a President's annual report, the last appearing in the 

 Proceedings for 1881. 



His successors having discontinued this practice, there has been 

 no summarized account of the operations of the Academy during 

 the past twenty years, and it is my purpose to present such a 

 resume in the following pages. 



During this period three members have occupied the President's 

 chair. Dr. Joseph Leidy, Gen. Isaac J. Wistar and Dr. Samuel G. 

 Dixon. William S. Vaux, Thomas Meehan, Henry C. McCook 

 and Arthur Erwiu Brown have served as Vice-Presidents ; William 

 C. Henzey, Isaac C. Martindale, Charles P. Perot and George 

 Vaux, Jr., as Treasurers; George H. Horn and Benjamin Sharp 

 as Corresponding Secretaries, while Edward J. Nolan has contin- 

 ued as Recording Secretary and Librarian throughout the entire 

 period. 



To the membership there have beeu added 505 names, while 374 

 have been lost by resignation or death. Among the latter are 

 many of the Academy's staunchest supporters, to whom her present 

 prosperous condition is largely due, and many of her most brilliant 

 students, who by their labors have spread her reputation to all 

 parts of the world. 



During this period the regular weekly meetings of the Academy 

 have been held, the attendance decreasing as natural history 

 became more and more specialized. Verbal communications of 

 importance have been made both by members and visitors, and 

 various explorers have by request presented reports of their expedi- 




742 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



tions before the society. The specialists have continued to hold 

 their independent meetings with most satisfactory results. Of 

 late years, by a mutual arrangement, the several Sections have been 

 given precedence at certain specified meetings of the Academy, 

 with the object of bringing before the general meetings the more 

 important communications presented at the less formal Section 

 meetings. 



With the object of fostering and encouraging small scientific- 

 organizations, especially those composed of younger students, the 

 Academy has freely granted the use of its balls for meetings, and 

 during the past decade the Geographical Society, Delaware Valley 

 Ornithological Club, Philadelphia Botanical Club, Students' Min- 

 eralogical Club, Students' Entomological Society, Myeological 

 Club, Leidy Association, Philadelphia Moss Chapter, Wood's Hole 

 Biological Association, Odontographical and Anti-Tuberculosis 

 Societies and Pennsylvania Audubon Society have availed themselves 

 of this privilege, thus bringing many people in touch with the 

 Academy and eventually adding to its membership. 



Besides these organizations, a number of State and National 

 societies have, during this period, been invited to hold their con- 

 ventions in the building, notably the American Society of Natural- 

 ists, in 1891; the Pennsylvania Veterinarian Society, in 1894; 

 and the American Ornithologists' Union, in 1899. 



The Proceedings and Journal of the Academy have been issued 

 continuously since 1881, as previously. Twenty-one volumes of the 

 former and four of the latter have appeared, comprising in all 

 12,100 pages. These contain contributions not only from the 

 members of the Academy, but from eminent scientists from various 

 parts of America and Europe. 



During the past twenty years the Proceedings have been sent in 

 exchange to a constantly increasing list of scientific societies 

 throughout the world. Beginning with the year 1900 the Acad- 

 emy, through its increased endowment, has been enabled to distrib- 

 ute the volumes to its membeis, a course that had long been 

 desired. There have also been issued from the Academy and 

 allied societies the Transactions of the American Entomological 

 Society, the Entomological News, and the Manual of Conchology, 

 while the Nautilus has been edited by the Conservator of the Con- 

 chological Section. 




1901. J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 743 



In 1885 the Committee on Lectures and Instruction established 

 an annual series of lectures by men of eminence in various 

 branches of science, as well as afternoon classes conducted by the 

 Academy's professors. For both series a charge was made to cover 

 expenses. These courses were held annually until the winter of 

 1896-7, when a proposition was made by the Ludwick Institute 

 whereby the Committee of the Academy should cooperate with the 

 Institute in arrangiug courses of lectures on natural science and 

 alhed subjects, to be given in the Academy's Lecture Hall and to be 

 free to the public, though primarily for the benefit of public school 

 teachers, the Ludwick Institute bearing all the expenses 



Under this arrangement six to eight courses of five lectures each 

 have been given annually by members of the Academy. 



Th,, Jessup Fund, originally established in 1860 for the assistance 

 of young men fitting themselves for scientific work, has during 

 the past twenty years aided many students, who have in turn ren- 

 dered most miportant assistance to the Academy in the care and 

 arrangement of collections. In 1888, Mrs. Clara Jessup Moore 

 estabhshed a similar fund of S.5,000 for the assistance of young 

 women, three having up to this time profited by this endowment 

 From 1890 to 1899 a medal and cash payment were annually 

 bestow;ed by the Academy upon the geologist who had accom- 

 plished the most meritorious. work during the year. Since then 

 a gold medal has beeu awarded triennially. This award known 

 as the Hayden IVIemorial, is secured by a fund given by Mrs 

 Hayden in memory of her husband, Pr. F. V. Hayden. 



Up to the year 1900 the Academy's growth had far exceeded its 

 endowment. The funds at the disposal of the institution were 

 entirely consumed in the expenses incident to supporting the 

 museum, the publications and the library. The salaried assistance 

 was wholly inadequate to the needs of the institution, and as pre- 

 viously, most of the work of arranging and caring for the collec- 

 tions was performed voluntarily or by students of the Jessup Fund 

 Members had always been most liberal in contributing to special 

 funds for the purchase of collections, but the Endowment Fund 

 owing to the broadening of the work of the Academy, became 

 yearly less adequate. 



Since 1890, however, the Academy has received liberal bequests. 




744 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



which have been of the utmost importance in the consummation of 

 plans for future development. 



George S. Pepper, iulOOO, bequeathed to the Academy S25,000 

 and a percentage of his residuary estate, the amounts to be held iu 

 trust, the income only to be applied to the uses of the institution. 



The James Aitken ^leigs Fund was erected on the legacy of 

 John G. Meigs, of $20,000, and the library of his sod, James 

 Aitken Meigs, M.D., a former Librarian of the Academy. Ten 

 thousand dollars of this was left for the care and increase of the 

 library and the remainder without condition. 



From Miss Anna T. Jeanes was received the gift of $20,000, to 

 be known as the Mary Jeanes Fund, the interest to be used for the 

 care and increase of the museum. 



In addition to amounts noted in earlier reports, $16,650 have 

 been received from the Henry N. Johnson estate for the general 

 purposes of the Academy. 



Robert T. Lamborn, M. D., vvho died in 1895, bequeathed his 

 estate to the Academy, " to be used in biological and anthropological 

 researches, the income only to be used and the principal reinvested." 

 A question as to the validity of the will under the New Yoi'k State 

 law having been raised by the heirs-at-law, a compromise was 

 effected on the basis of one-half the estate coming to the Academy 

 and the balance to them. Up to the present time $365,000 have 

 been realized for the society. A conservative estimate places the 

 value of the Academy's portion of the estate at half a million. 



Charles E. Smith, iu 1900, bequeathed his botanical books, 

 maps, collections and one-sixth part of the sum realized from the 

 sale of real and personal property, the interest accruing from such 

 sum to be applied to and exiicnded on maintenance and for no other 

 purpose whatever. Twenty -five thousand dollars have been realized 

 from this source to date, with the certainty of important additions 

 in the future. 



As soon as the earlier of these legacies became available, steps 

 were at once taken to broaden the work of the institution in vari- 

 ous directions. The ProrcediiKjs were distributed to members; the 

 salaries of the scientific staff were increased; three new assistants 

 engaged; improvements were made to the buildings; new cases 

 were substituted for those originally erected in the museum, and 

 important additions to the sheUnng capacity of the library were 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 745 



provided. The work of expansion is still in progress, and to 

 understand properly the advance that has been made it is necessary 

 to revert again to the removal of the Academy to its present quar- 

 ters in 1876. 



At that time only a part of the building as originally planned 

 had been completed, and the collections and library of the Academy 

 even then practically filled all the available space. The constant 

 increase during the subsequent ten years caused such overcrowding 

 that the systematic arrangement of the museum became an irapos- 

 sibility, and much valuable material was practically inaccessible. 



In 1889 and 1891 two appropriatfons of 850,000 each were 

 secured from the State Legislature. These sums, together with 

 private subscriptions, made possible the much-needed additions to 

 the premises. The Lecture Hall was completed the following year, 

 and formally opened on February 22, 1892. Lectures previously 

 given in the Library have since then been dehvered in the new 

 Hall, which has been furnished with a lantern and screen and 

 seating accommodations for 350 persons. 



The new wing of the museum was not completed until some 

 years later and was finally opened on October 20, 1896. 



Owing to the lack of funds only two floors could then be 

 opened, and only a part of one of them was furnished with new 

 cases. Since then, however, new cases of plate glass with oak or 

 mahogany woodwork have almost entirely replaced the old ones on 

 l;hese floors, as well as in portions of the old building, and the 

 furnishing of the third floor of the new Museum is so far advanced 

 that it will be opened during the coming year. 



In the character and care of the various collections the greatest 

 changes have taken place, mainly since the recent increase in our 

 endowment, though in several departments the plans were laid 

 and work begun several years ago. The old idea of exhibiting 

 every specimen has been dispensed with, and the need of study 

 collections of large series of specimens has been recognized. 



Large numbers of birds and mammals, especially types and 

 unique specimens, have been unmounted and stored in moth-proof 

 cabinets, free from light and dust, and their preservation insured. 

 These have been arranged in the study rooms, where they caa be 

 easily examined, while still larger numbers of similar study speci- 

 mens have been added, by purchase and gift. A corresponding 




746 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



arrangement of the moUusca lias also been instituted. The entire 

 series of alcoholics has been removed from the exhibition rooms 

 and placed in compactly arranged cases in the basement, where 

 some 100,000 specimens are veithin easy reach of the student who 

 desires to consult them, being at the same time largely shielded 

 from the light, the great destroyer of pigment. For exhibition 

 there is being installed by the liberality of Mr. Clarence B. INIoore 

 a series of plaster casts of snakes, colored and mounted amid 

 natural surroundings, which are far more instructive to the general 

 public than the alcoholics that have been removed. 



In the Botanical department the modern plan of mounting the 

 specimens upon uniform standard herbarium sheets, begun some time 

 ago, has been finished during the present year, with the exception 

 of certain special collections. 



The museum catalogues are the work of recent years. In 1893 

 uniform catalogues were provided for all departments, except En- 

 tomology and Botany. In some only the accessions since that date 

 have been entered, but in the cases of the mammals, birds, rep- 

 tiles, fishes and minerals every specimen has been numbered and 

 entered in its respective catalogue. In the case of disarticulated 

 skeletons every bone has been numbered. 



These catalogues are necessarily only accession lists, but a sys- 

 tematic card catalogue of the mammals has been prepared, showing 

 at a glance exactly what the Academy possesses in this department 

 of the museum. 



The character of the exhibition specimens has also been much im- 

 proved. In 1892, a taxidermist was employed and all mammals 

 and birds since prepared for exhibition have been mounted in the 

 most ap|>roved manner. A large number of mammals have been 

 prepared during the past ten years, and so far as the larger forms 

 are concerned, they have replaced the grotesque and faded stuffed 

 specimens of earlier years, while a local collection of birds, 

 mounted in groups, with nests and eggs, has replaced the old 

 series. 



The Academy's efforts of late years have been mainly devoted 

 to the renovation of the museum, the increase of the collections 

 and library, and the expansion of the publications. Nevertheless, 

 a number of expeditions have been sent out in its interest through 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 747 



special subscriptions, whilQ many private individuals have con- 

 tributed results of their explorations to the institution. 



Under the former head may be mentioned the expeditions to 

 Bermuda in 1888, Mexico in 1890, under the leadership of Angelo 

 Heilprin; the Greenland Expeditions of 1891 and 1892; Prof. 

 Cope's trip through the fossil beds of the West in 1893, and many 

 minor collecting trips. 



Among private expeditions may be mentioned those of Dr. Ben- 

 jamin Sharo to Hawaii and Alaska, Dr. W. L. Abbott to Africa, 

 Dr. A. Donaldson Smith to Somaliland and Lake Rudolf, the 

 Messrs. Farnum to Mongolia, while Mr. Alfred C. Harrison and 

 Dr. II. M. Hi Her are at present exploring Sumatra, partially in the 

 Academy's interest. 



Mr. Clarence B. Moore's archaeological explorations in Florida 

 and Georgia ; the exploration of the Port Kennedy fossil deposit, 

 in the years ] 894-96, under the direction of Dr. Samuel G. 

 Dixon, assisted by Mr. H. C Mercer; Mr. C. W. Johnson's expe- 

 ditions to the Southern fossil beds, under the direction of Dr. L. T. 

 Chamberlain, and Mr. Henry G. Bryant's expeditions to Labra- 

 dor, Greenland and Alaska have also been productive of important 

 results. 



The increase in collections, especially since modern methods have 

 been instituted in the Museum, has been so continuous and impor- 

 tant that it is impossible even to summarize it in this brief space. 

 Some idea, however, may be gained from the statements furnished 

 by several special departments. 



The Ornithological collection, which was formerly regarded as 

 the Academy's most notable department, contained at the time of 

 Dr. Ruschenberger's last report 24,000 specimens; to-day it num- 

 bers 46,000. The Conchological department since 1887 alone has 

 added 30,000 lots to what was before regarded as the leading col- 

 lection in the world. Other collections have increased at nearly 

 the same rate, as illustrated by 6,000 additions to the department 

 of reptiles, mainly the private collection of Prof. Edward D. 

 Cope, and one prepared by Mr. A. E. Brown; 14,000 to the col- 

 lection of butterflies; the William S. Vaux Collection of Minerals; 

 the Isaac Lea Collection of eocene fossils, for which we are 

 indebted to the Rev. Leander Trowbridge Chamberlain, D.D., and 

 the Clarence B. Moore Archjeological Collection. 




748 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. , 



Only passing mention has been made of the growth of the 

 library, not because of any lack of development in this depart- 

 ment, but because the Librarian purposes, in his annual report, to 

 review the history of the library since the organization of the 

 society. The development of this important section of the Acad- 

 emy, it will be seen, has kept pace with that of its other depart- 

 ments. 



The present condition of the society, in its museum, its library 

 and the work of its Publication Committee, is most encouraging, 

 and gives every assurance of future success in maintaining the high 

 standards established by the devoted men who have contributed 

 so much intellectually and financially to the advancement of 

 science. 



Samuel G. Dixon, 



Pr&iident. 



REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



The meetings of the Academy have been held during the year 

 with three intermissions, due to the lack of a quorum on July 30, 

 August 13 and September 17. The average of attendance at the 

 sessions that were held was sixteen. Verbal comraunications were 

 made by Messrs. Rand, Rhoads, Pilsbry, Arthur E. Brown, 

 Harshberger, Woolman, MacElwee, Sharp, Chapman, Dixon, 

 Roseberger, U. C. Smith, Skinner, J. Chestou Morris, T. H. Mont- 

 gomery, Calvert, Conklin, Seiss, Gerson, Keeley, J. P. Moore, 

 Goldsmith, Lyman, Keller, Murlin, Stone, Palmer, Kraemer, 

 Crawley, S. Brown, Ravenel and McCarthy. Interesting discus- 

 sion occasionally followed these communications, the substance of 

 which was frequently embodied in the more formal papers pre- 

 sented later for publication, hence but few of the verbal contribu- 

 tions to the meetings nave been prepared for the published Pro- 

 ceedings. 



Seven hundred and thirty pages of the Proceedings, with thirty- 

 four plates, have been issued since the last report. The fourth 

 number, or the conclusion of the eleventh volume of the Journal, 

 consisting of ninety-eight pages, copiously illustrated by text 

 figures, was also published, the expense of printing and illustra- 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 749 



tions being defrayed by Mr. Clarence B. Moore, to whom the 

 Academy is again indebted for this proof of his continued interest. 



The Entomological Section (American Entomological Society) 

 has published two hundred and seventy-six pages of the Trans- 

 actions with ten plates and three hundred and twenty-eight pages 

 of the Entomological News with thirteen plates. 



The Manual of Conchology has been continued under the auspices 

 of the Conchological Section, two hundred and seventy-one pages 

 and sixty plates having been issued during the year. 



The published contributions to science by the Acadeiqy and its 

 Sections during the year amount, therefore, to 1703 pages and 117 

 plates. 



The statistics of distribution are as follows :

The published edition of the Proceedings is 1,500; of the Jour- 

 nal, 500. 



Fifty-six papers have been presented for publication during the 

 year, as follows: Henry A. Pilsbry, 10; Henry W. Fowler, 6; 

 James A. G. Rehn, 4; John VV. Harshberger, 4; Thomas H. 

 Montgomery, Jr., 3; Clarence B. Moore, 2; T. D. A. Cockerell,

 B. Thompson, 1 ; Ida A. Keller, 1 ; Henry Kraemer, 1 ; Benja- 

 min H. Smith, 1 ; A. M. Reese, 1 ; M. Louise Nichols, 1 ; Harold 

 Heath and M. H. Spaulding, 1 ; Carrie B. Aaron, 1 ; Thomas L. 

 Casey, 1 ; C. W. Johnson and A. W. Grabau, 1 ; E. Goldsmith, 

 1 ; Nathan Banks, 1. Forly-seven of these have been printed in 

 the Proceedings, two in the Journal, three were withdrawn by the 




750 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec. , 



authors, one was returned to the author, one was transferred to the 

 Entomological Section, and two await action. A communication 

 from F. Rynchowski, of Lemberg, embodying his researches on the 

 " Electroid (Eteroid) " was, with the author's consent, referred 

 to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. 



The first year of the new century sees the completion of the 

 fifty-third volume of the Proceedings and the eleventh volume of 

 the quarto or second series of the Journal. The first series in 

 octavo, in eight volumes, extended from 1817 to 1842. The 

 Academy's entire serial contributions to science, therefore, now 

 consists of seventy-two volumes. The earlier issues, especially, 

 formed almost the only means by which the working naturalists of 

 America could communicate with those of kindred interests else- 

 where, and much of the results of the original investigations of 

 Say, Ord, LeSeuer, Nuttall, Maclure, Horner, Mitchell, Rafin- 

 esque, Lea, Hentz, Troost, Vanuxem, De Schweinitz and many 

 others of the leading naturalists of America are to be found in 

 these volumes. Au index to this collection of scientific papers is 

 manifestly desirable, and would probably be regarded by students 

 as a valuable aid in their work. The present time is especially ap- 

 propriate for its publication, because it would not only form a 

 guide to all that the Academy has given to the world during the 

 last century, but it would be continued without break or repetition 

 by the proposed ind&x to scientific literature which is about to be 

 prepared under the auspices of the Royal Society of Loudon, as 

 the result of international cooperation. The compilation is recom- 

 mended of an index that will be a complete and reliable guide to 

 the contents of the Academy's serial publications, consisting of 

 perhaps three sections devoted to author, subject and species 

 entries. It does not seem desirable in the course of the work to 

 attempt the decision of questions of priority or the determination of 

 synonymy. 



Fourteen menibers and five correspondents have been elected. 

 The deaths of five members and six correspondents have been 

 announced and the following members have resigned: Edw. H. 

 Coates, Robert S Davis, Edw. Gideon, William DeCou, Vickers 

 Oberholzer, A. H. Stewart, W. E. Barrows and Thomas Stew- 

 ardson. 



A severe loss was sustained in the death, November 19, of Mr. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 751 



Thomas Meehan, whose consoientious devotion to the welfare of 

 the Academy, aad e.specially of its Botanical department, during 

 more than forty years of membership, is warmly appreciated by 

 his associates. A minute embodying the Academy's sense of its 

 loss has been published in the Proceedings and a biographical 

 notice, to be read at an early meeting, is in course of preparation by 

 Dr. John MacFarlane. 



A reception was tendered to Dr. A. Doualdsou Smith, to whom 

 the Academy is indebted for valuable additions to the Museum, on 

 his last return from Africa. The occasion was enjoyed by many 

 who were interested in Dr. Smith's work as an explorer. 



The President has appointed Mr. Clarence B. Moore as a repre- 

 sentative of the Academy to serve on the General Committee of 

 Arrangements for the International Congress of Americanists to be 

 held in New York next year. 



Messrs. Vaux, Nolan, Wistar, Roberts and Schaeffer have been 

 appointed a committee to consider and report on the subject of 

 memorial tablets to contain the names of benefactors of the Acad- 

 emy, and to be placed at the entrance to the Museum. 



All of which is respectfully submitted, 



Edward J. Nolan, 



Recording Secretary. 



REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY. 



During the past year, there have been received from nineiy-five 

 societies, museums, libraries, etc., one hundred and sixty-three 

 acknowledgments of the publications of the Academy, and from 

 thirty-seven societies, libraries, etc., tifty-two notices of transmis- 

 sion of their publications. 



Fourteen applications for exchange of publications and for sup- 

 plies of deficiencies, together with six circulars and invitations for 

 the Academy to participate in congresses, etc., and five announce- 

 ments of the deaths of scientific men, have also been received. 

 ' Four correspondents have been elected during the year, and 

 the deaths of six have been recorded. 



Six letters on miscellaneous subjects have been received and 

 eleven written.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN. 



The growth of the Library, as far as the ordinary current acces- 

 sions are concerned, has been unprecedented during the past year. 

 A total of 6,184 additions have been received, classified and cata- 

 logued; 4,678 of these are pamphlets and parts of periodicals, 

 1,380 are complete volumes, 124 maps, and one photograph.

They were distributed to the several departments of the library, 

 as follows: 



Fourteen hundred and seventy-two volumes have been bound, 

 making a noticeable improvement in the library, especially in the 

 department of periodicals. Only those who have been compelled 

 to consult unbound sets of journals, the numbers unavoidably mixed 

 and the indexes probably misplaced, can appreciate the comfort of 

 working with volumes bound to date. Large appropriations for 

 the work are still required, nearly three thousand volumes in the 

 department of periodicals alone still requiring binding, but it is a 

 cause of sincere congratulation that they will now be handled as 

 rapidly as the necessary collation will permit. An important 

 addition to the cases has been provided in the central entresol 




1901.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 755 



room, relieving for the present the pressure on some of the more 

 crowded sections of the periodicals. The growth of the library 

 in this department, as indeed in all the others, is likely to be so 

 rapid in the future, in view of the comparatively liberal appro- 

 priations which can now be made, that the question of additional 

 shelving and room for its accommodation will soon become a press- 

 ing one. Another important need is a case for the arrangement 

 and storage of maps, the necessity of which was brought to the 

 attention of the Academy as early as 1889. 



Among the more important accessions of the past year have been 

 a number of early sets of journals secured from the catalogues of 

 second-hand dealers. As the Academy has special reason to set 

 store by what is believed to be its weU-nigh unequaled collection of 

 journals and transactions, it is desirable that desiderata be secured 

 as promptly as possible, as the opportunities of doing so are yearly 

 becoming fewer because of the very liberal means at the disposal 

 of many scientific libraries recently started and the vigor of their 

 administration. The Academy has had the advantage of being 

 early in the field, and, though having no means of its own for many 

 years, the devotion of William Maclure and Thomas B. Wilson 

 secured for it bibliographical treasures which can no longer be 

 bought. 



A list of the serials now received in exchange or subscribed for 

 is appended. 



The works on Philology have been selected from the Meigs 

 Library and from the department of Anthropology, and now form 

 a separate section containing 296 volumes. 



The card catalogue is being carefully revised and certain un- 

 avoidable duplications and irregularities are being corrected. 



A portrait of the late Thomas Meehan, in oil, by James L. 

 Wood, was presented by Mr. Charles Roberts in May. While it 

 has distinct value as a work of art, it forms a most desirable 

 memorial of the senior Vice-President, whose recent death is 

 referred to elsewhere. 



Dr. John G. LeConte presented a crayon portrait of Mr. Charles 

 E. Smith, a benefactor v?hose death was announced last year. 

 The picture has been placed in the herbarium. 



The present extent of the library, determined by a careful 

 count, is as follows :

In considering the growth of the library since the last enumera- 

 tion, it must be remembered that about 450 volumes, bibliographical 

 and non-scientific, have been, by direction of tlie Council and the 

 Library Committee, transferred to the Free Library. 



Many of the works in the library of the Entomological Section 

 (American Eotomological Society) are duplicates, while those in 

 the James Aitken Meigs Library are foreign to the purposes of 

 the Academy, being retained under an agreement with the legatee. 



It may not be out of place, at the beginning of the new cen- 

 tury, to review briefly the history of the library, so as to deter- 

 mine with some degree of clearness what- has been accomplished by 

 this department of the Academy during its ninety years of existence. 



It will be remembered that on the evening of January 25, 1812, 

 •" a meeting of gentlemen, friends of science and of rational dis- 

 posal of leisure moments, " was held to consider the advisability 

 of forming a scientific society. After mature deliberation it was 

 decided that such a society was desirable, and preliminary steps 

 were taken toward its organization. The men who met on tiiat 

 occasion took themselves with entire seriousness, as is evidenced by 

 the dignified wording of the minutes and the care with which they 

 were kept by the first Recording Secretary, Dr. Caraillus McMahau 

 Mann. They evidently attached due importance to the formation 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 757 



of a library, for a committee consisting of Messrs. Troost and 

 Shinn was appointed to consider, among other weighty matters, 

 " which are the fittest periodical works to engage in the first in- 

 stance for the accommodation of the society." 



No report seems to have been received from this, the first Library 

 Committee, but under date of March 17 of the same year, a mem- 

 orandum records that " Mr. Shinn will accommodate the society 

 with the Mineralor/ical Journal of Dr. Bruce; Mr. Speakman 

 will furnish the National Intelligencer ; Dr. Parmentier, the Attrora 

 and a map of Switzerland; Dr. Mann, the Monthly Magazine for 

 1807. Drs. Troost and Parmentier have engaged for account of 

 the society the Annales de Chymie and the Annales des Arts et de 

 Commerce. Mr. Shinn is commissioned to procure for account of 

 the society the Archives of Useful Knowledge of Dr. Mears, and 

 the Medical Museum of Drs. Mitchell and Millar. Agreed to pro- 

 cure the Repertory of Arts from London. ' ' 



On April 18, " the Secretary makes homage to the Academy of 

 The Bureau, weekly newspaper recently commenced, which he has 

 subscribed for." ^t the same meeting it was " referred to the 

 Committee to purchase at least one portfolio, for the purpose of 

 depositing extracts from newspapers announcing recent discoveries 

 and extraordinary facts, with a view to have them afterward 

 arranged in a proper book and inquiries instituted thereupon." 

 The Secretary was requested " to procure a report of Prof. Davy 

 of the London Institution's lectures lately delivered on the subject 

 of Zoology." He was also requested " to procure report on Prof. 

 Davy's experiments and conclusions on the subject of the oxymuri- 

 atic acid, and to require report from Dr. Mitchell at time of 

 writing to that gentleman his letter of notification." It was 

 ordered, Mr. Troost seeming to have dropped out, " that Mr. 

 Shinn be requested to make his report on the periodical works 

 eligible for the Academy, and if possible to procure the latest 

 number of Nicholson'n Journal." 



Then more definitely, on August 15, the Secretary was " re- 

 quired to obtain the following works on science : Nicholson' s Journal 

 from the commencement of the year 1810; a periodical work said 

 to be conducted by Dr. Thompson, of London, from its com- 

 mencement; Repertory of Artsitora the beginning of 1810; Mur- 

 ray's Chemistry, last edition; Thompson's Chemistry, edition of 




758 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



1810, if none since published; Davies' Elements of Chemistry ; 

 Tilloch's Magazine from the beginning of 1810; best comparative 

 statement of the experiments relative to the oxymuriatic acid. ' ' 



These are the brief records concerning the library in the earliest 

 minutes of the Academy. It will be seen that they all relate to 

 intentions for the future, except in the one case where the Secre- 

 tary " makes homage" or presents The Bureau, a periodical for 

 which he had recently subscribed, and of this, curiously enough, 

 no record is to be found in the earliest published catalogue of the 

 library. The list of desiderata indicates how largely the first 

 members were concerned with physics and chemistry, subjects 

 which now receive little or no attention in the Academy. 



The growth of the library was slow until 1816, when Mr. 

 William Maclure, who was elected President the following year, 

 began his liberal donations, which in 1819 had reached nearly 

 1,500 volumes. A contemporary notice of the Academy says: 

 " The value of these acquisitions was enhanced by the fact that 

 they were possessed by no other institution on this side of the 

 Atlantic. The Academy, therefore, derived from this source a 

 prosperity and prominence which, under other circumstances, must 

 have been extremely slow and uncertain; while science at the 

 same time received an impulse which has never faltered and which 

 has been subsequently imparted to every section of our country." 

 Mr. Maclure transferred his library at New Harmony to the 

 Academy in 1834. Dr. Pickering, then Librarian, the following 

 year superintended the conveyance of the collection, embracing 

 2,259 volumes on science, literature and art, to the Academy. 



A catalogue of the library was begun in the first issue of the 

 Journal in 1817, and was completed in the fourth volume, pub- 

 lished in 1824. The collection then seems to have consisted of 

 1,675 volumes, embracing 672 titles. 



Another catalogue, published in 1836, gives the number of vol- 

 umes then in the library, excluding a collection of historical 

 documents, at 6,890, of which no less than 5,232 are thankfully 

 ci'edited to Mr. Maclure. The classification was practically that 

 which is still maintained, but the collection embraced hundreds of 

 volumes on finance, law, morals, literature, religion, amusements, 

 military art and other subjects not at all pertinent to the Academy, 

 and which have long since been disposed of by sale or exchange. 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7-59 



In a note to Morton's biographical notice of William Maclure, 

 prepared in 1841, it is stated that the library then consisted of 

 7,000 volumes. 



At this time certain designated books were permitted to be bor- 

 rowed, but the Committee expresses grave doubt as to the advis- 

 ability of continuing the practice, as serious loss of works which 

 could not be replaced had been detected during the preparation of 

 the catalogue of 1836. It was strongly recommended, in harmony 

 with the desire of Mr. Maclure, that the librury should be exclu- 

 sively for use within the building. It was considered, however, 

 that this was scarcely practicable until the services of a salaried 

 Librarian could be secured. 



In May, 1845, Dr. Thomas B. Wilson presented Owen's His- 

 tory of British Fossil Mmmnalia and Birds, and from that date 

 until bis death, March 15, 1865, more than 10,000 volumes in 

 all branches of natural history were received from this liberal 

 patron of the Academy. These formed the rarest and most expen- 

 sive portions of the library — complete sets of early transactions 

 and superbly illustrated monographs. Week after week the Wil- 

 son package was examined with delight, as it was sure to contain 

 not only contributions indispensable to the workers, but also gifts 

 of the highest artistic value, such as Gould's Monographs, Wolf's 

 Zoological Sketches, Cheuu's Illustrations Conchy liologiques, Reich- 

 enbacli's Xenia Orchidacea, Lindley and Moore's Ferns of Great 

 Britain, etc. Dr. Wilson's earlier contributions were placed witli 

 the society on deposit, but were given c^jitright in 1850 on condi- 

 tion that they should not be removed from the building, a rule 

 which was then extended to the entire library. 



Dr. Thomas B. Wilson was not the only member of his family 

 who took an active interest in the Academy. Between the years 

 1850 and 1857 his brother, Mr. Edward Wilson, residing in 

 England, presented to the society 4,184 rare volumes and pam- 

 phlets of the last century, and after Dr. Wilson's death a valuable 

 selection from his library was received from another brother, Mr. 

 Rathmell Wilson. Nor did the benefit derived by the Academy 

 from the liberality of Dr. Wilson cease at his death. He be- 

 queathed to the society $10,000, directing that $300 of the annual 

 income should be contributed toward the payment of the salary of 

 the Librarian, the balance to be expended for the continuation of his 




"60 PKOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC. , 



subscriptions and for the purchase and binding of kindred books. 

 By means of this fund the Academy has been enabled from time to 

 time to add to the library many costly monographs which, until 

 quite recently, it would otherwise have been unable to procure. 



In 1850 the collection had increased to 12,057 volumes. 



Apart from these gifts and others from friends of the society, 

 the growth of the library had depended on a system of exchange 

 with other scientific societies, begun in 1817 when the Journal of 

 the Academy was first issued. This important source of supply 

 has since been maintained, with the result of securing the earliest 

 information regarding original research from all parts of the world. 

 Very inadequate sums for the purchase of books were secured 

 from time to time by subscriptions or sales of material not germane 

 to the Academy. The historical documents received from Mr. 

 Maclure were sold to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in 

 1861 for $500. This was known as the Maclure Fund. A mo- 

 tion to invest the amount and expend the interest only was voted 

 down and the entire sum was placed at the disposal of the Library 

 Committee for the purchase of books. 



The Conarroe Fund was a small amount arising from the sale of 

 books presented by George M. Conarroe. Sums of money for 

 special needs were frequently contributed by Mr. Joseph Jeanesand 

 a Library Fund was started in 1800, to which twenty-seven sub- 

 scribers contributed $25 each annually until 1868. Some dupli- 

 cates were sold in 1870 for $100, and others were exchanged for a 

 copy of Elliott's Birds of JVorth America. 



These were all helps, but a permanent endowment was sadly 

 needed, for the income from the AVil?on Bequest, after the sum 

 toward the salary of the Librarian had been deducted, did not 

 always yield a suflScient balance to pay (he subscriptions. It can 

 therefore be readily understood with what joy Mr. Isaiah V. 

 Williamson's gift in 1875 of S25,000 in ground rents was re- 

 ceived. The income only was to be expended on the purchase of 

 scientific books, and the I. V. Williamson Fund, inaugurating a 

 period of pros^perity up to that time unknown, continues to yield 

 an important part of the resources at the disposal of the Library 

 Committee. 



In 1882 eighteen hundred and ninety-seven volumes — 1,272 on 

 religion, history, politics, general literature, 422 duplicates and 201 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 761 



on fine arts and architecture — were sold for $1,825.14 By an ar- 

 rangement with Mr. George W. Tryon, Jr., one-half this sum was 

 devoted to the Conchological Section, and the other was appro- 

 priated for binding. 



The Warner Library, consisting of 1,045 volumes and 1,200 

 pamphlets, mostly ou mathematics, came into the possession of the 

 society in 1892, on the coming of age of Mr. Warner's daughter 

 and heiress. 



The library of James Aitken Meigs, consisting of 5,089 

 volumes, 1,916 of which were on other than scientific subjects, was 

 bequeathed to the Academy by his father, John G. Meigs, who 

 also left to the society $20,000, one-half for the exclusive use of 

 the library. Before his death Mr. Meigs intimated his desire 

 that even the volumes not pertinent to the Academy should be 

 kept together as A\e James Aitken Meigs Library, and this desire 

 has been so far complied with. 



The first catalogue of the library was published, it will be 

 remembered, at irregular intervals in the first four volumes of the 

 Journal from 1817 to 1824. No classification is indicated in this 

 list. The carefully compiled catalogue of 1836 is divided into broad 

 subject sections. Dr. Fisher reports the beginning of a new cata- 

 logue in 1859, but the intention, it would appear, was not carried 

 out. The catalogues then in use were manuscript hand-lists, 

 arranged a]phi\betically for each separate department. They were 

 not kept strictly up to date. They were added to and copied by a 

 special clerical assistant in 1863 and 1864, and were again tran- 

 scribed in 1878. They remained in use until 1885, when they 

 were finally replaced by a card catalogue which, in a very crude 

 form, had been begun in 1874 and completed in 1880. The num- 

 bering of the library was begun with the Conchological Department 

 in 1869, and gradually extended, as a matter of convenience, to 

 the other sections of the library in connection with the prepara- 

 tion of the card catalogue. Shelf lists of the several departments, 

 indispensable for the proper placing of the books and in accounting 

 for missing volumes, were also prepared. 



From 1883 to 1894 much-needed clerical assistance was secured 

 in a more or less intermittent way. The expenses were defrayed 

 by subscriptions secured by Mrs. Annis Lea Wister and Dr. 

 Henry M. Fisher. The old card catalogue was transcribed on 




762 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



regulation library cards, arranged in drawers in three sections 

 devoted to authors, subjects and periodicals. It was begun in 

 1885, is the basis of the catalogue now in use and meets measur- 

 ably the requirements of modern library administration. The 

 clerk also did much good work in the endeavor to secure supplies of 

 deficiencies from corresponding societies. 



Mr. William J. Fox was appointed messenger March 26, 1888. 



Proving himself intelligent and trustworthy in the performance 



of such work as was assigned him, he was promoted to the position 



of Assistant Librarian in 1890, and has since been efficient in 



. forwarding the interests of the Academy. 



To provide for the supposed wants of students the experiment 

 of keeping the library open until 10 P.M. was begun in 1873 and 

 continued until 1876, when it was abandoned as not serving any 

 useful end on account of the extremely limited n«mber of members 

 using the books in the evening. 



A catalogue of duplicates was printed and distributed in 1899. 

 A number of sales have been effected, but the larger part of the 

 collection remains yet on hand. 



Up to 1847 the library had been arranged in connection with 

 the Museum, manifestly to the great discomfort of students who, 

 as Dr. Zantzinger says in his report for that year, were excluded 

 from the hall when it was open to the public. The society then 

 occupied the building at the corner of Broad and Sansora streets 

 (Plate C), into which it had moved from Twelfth and Sansom streets 

 (Plate B) seven years before. During the year mentioned the ijooks 

 were arranged in a department expressly designed as a libfary 

 and meeting room at the western end of the ground floor. The 

 Librarian was then required to be on duty during pari of the fore- 

 noon, his place being supplied in the afternoon by the Chairman 

 of the Curators. The eastern hall, in which the collections of 

 minerals and fossils, had been arranged, was given up to the Library 

 in 1855, and was used from 1857 as a meeting room. Finally the 

 western section, formerly used for this purpose, was divided in 

 two by a partition of cases erected from time to time by the liber- 

 ality of Dr. Thomas B. Wilson, thus providing on the floor and 

 gallery additional room and j)lacing the library in the condition 

 in which it remained until removal to the present imildiug in 1876. 

 The present system of alternating alcoves and study rooms with the 




1901. I \ATUIIAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 763 



spacious gallery above for the arrangement of periodicals is well 

 known to all now using the library. 



The accompanying plates, D, E and F, illustrate the ground -plan 

 of the building vacated iu ISTt] and the present distribution and 

 aspect of the library. 



The tirslrLibrariau was John Speakmau, who was elected Noveni. 

 bar 29, 1814, and served until December 26, 1815, when he was 

 succeeded iu rapid succession by Caleb Richardson, Jacob Pierce, 

 S. W. Conrad, Charles Pickering, Paul Beck Goddard, Joseph 

 Carson, Robert Bridges, Alfred L. Elwyn, Jo.«eph Leidy, and 

 William S. Zautziuger. Several of these served only one or two 

 years. Dr. Zantzinger alone reaching an incumbency of ten years. 

 Then came Dr. James Aitkeu Meigs, from August, 1856, to May, 

 1859, and Dr. James C. Fisher, from June 28, 1859, to August 

 27, 1861, when he entered the army as contract surgeon and was 

 succeeded by Dr. R. E. Griffith, who served only one year. 



It was becoming hard to find any one who was willing to take the 

 office. There were certain duties which manifestly had to be per- 

 formed. As exchanges came in and the Wilson packages were 

 delivered, the accessions must be shelved and recorded, even 

 though they were not systematically catalogued, and some few, 

 from time to time, had to be prepared for the binder. Dr. Robert 

 Bridges devoted much time at irregular intervals to the latter duty, 

 although not officially. He deserves, also, the grateful remem- 

 brance of the Academy for his supervision, in connection with Mr. 

 William S. Yaux, of the distribution of the Proceedings and Jour- 

 nal to subscribers and exchanges, the editorial work being per- 

 formed by Dr. Josei)h Leidy, then and until his death. Chairman 

 of the Publication Committee. 



Mr. J. Dickinson Sergeant was finally prevailed on to take the 

 Librarianship, but only on condition that an assistant should be 

 engaged to perform the routine duties of the office. The financial 

 resources of the Academy were not such as to permit the engage- 

 ment of a trained bibliographer, and a boy was employed who 

 owed his selection to the good offices of Mr. John Cassin. The 

 Assistant's first record of accessions was made February 4, 1862, 

 within a few days of the beginning of the second half century of 

 the society's history. 




764 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



Mr. Sergeant held the Librarianship until December, 1867, 

 when the Assistant, who had in the meantime taken a degree from 

 the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania, under 

 the preceptorship of the beloved Leidy, was appointed to the 

 office which he has held continuously ever since. If the situation 

 be unchanged, therefore, in February of next year, he will have 

 had the supervision of the Academy's Library, in conjutiction with 

 the Library Committee, as Assistant and Librarian for forty years. 

 He begs to be allowed, on this occasion, to put on record his obliga- 

 tion to his first and only chief, J. Dickinson Sergeant, for the 

 kindly forbearance, helpful council and unfailing courtesy and 

 encouragement which filled the life of the boy with interest and 

 gladness and turned the daily task which, under an unsympathetic 

 master, might well have been irksome enough, iuto a labor of 

 Jove. Dr. Leidy, also, was invariably helpful and encouraging, 

 and the Librarian is unceasingly thankful that early in his life it 

 was given to him to know, and in a measure to appreciate, the high 

 ideals embodied in those two men. 



A like acknowledgment of obligation is, in a measure, due to 

 nearly every one with whom he has been brought into asso- 

 ciation during his forty years of service in the Academy. Only 

 the most cordial associations are called up by the names of Lea, 

 Wilson, Bridges, Hays, LeConte, Slack, Cassin, Tryon, Vaux, 

 Jeanes, Allen, Horn, Redfield and Meehan, not to mention the 

 dear friends who are still met with every day, to all of whom he 

 is indebted for kindliness, courtesy, and forbearance. His paths 

 have been made by them paths of pleasantness. 



The Librarian hopes that he may be forgiven these personalities. 

 It can be safely asserted that he will not have an opportunity, 

 after an additional equal term of service, to record his obligation 

 to his associates living and dead. 



The statistics pTesented above show that the Academy possesses, 

 including all the books in the building, except duplicates set apart 

 for sale, a library of over 50,000 volumes. Their arrangement 

 is practically what the present Librarian inherited from his prede- 

 cessors in 1862. It is far from meeting the requirements of 

 modern library classification, but in practice it has been found to 

 be not far short of what is wanted by the worker. Books as they 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 765 



are received are placed under their respective headings, for the 

 most part consecutively, a separate running number being used in 

 each department. The subject catalogue in a measure supplies 

 the needs of a more philosophic arrangement, and it is easy to 

 make a memorandum of the position of books on a given subject. 

 Still, the adoption of the decimal system of arrangement would 

 be, in some respects, desirable ; but reclassification and recata- 

 loguing will involve great inconvenience and a heavy expense, aa 

 the employment of a corps of trained assistants will be unavoid- 

 able. It may be that some one interested in the welfare of the 

 library will volunteer to defray the cost of making such a change 

 in the prompt way which would involve the least discomfort, or the 

 Academy in the future may find itself in a position to make the 

 required appropriations. Until that time arrives it is a satisfac- 

 tion to know that few or no complaints are heard from the earnest 

 workers who use the library in yearly increasing numbers, and 

 who are intelligently informed as to what they desire in the prose- 

 cution of their work of original research. 



The statistics of work and growth for the year are sufficient 

 evidence that this department is actively benefitted by the improved 

 financial condition of the Academy. Every book added to the 

 shelves as the result of the judicious administration of its resources 

 is a memorial of the liberal and enlightened men who have selected 

 the Academy as their agent in the advancement of science. 



Mr. William J. Fox has continued to render intelligent and 

 willing assistance to the Librarian, and also in many important 

 ways to the Recording Secretary. 



All of which is respectfully submitted, 



Edward J. Nolan, 



Librarian. 




76(5 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The Curators are able to report many improvenienis in the 

 museum and buildings of the Academy during the past year, as 

 well as important advances in the arrangement and growth of the 

 collections. " 



In the early part of the year, through the increased funds at their 

 disposal, the services of Dr. Henry Skinner and Mr. E. G. 

 Vanatta were secured as Assistants ; Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry was 

 appointed Special Curator of Mollusca, while Mr. Henry W. 

 Fowler has been employed identifying, arranging and caring for 

 the collection of fishes. 



With these additions the salaried staff of the Academy is now 

 greater than ever before, and the work accomplished during the 

 year has been correspondingly increased. 



During the summer the outside woodwork of the buildings, 

 which has been for some time badly in need of attention, has been 

 entirely repainted, and necessary repairs have been made to the 

 roofs. 



A number of cases have been erected for the extension of the 

 library and for the accommodation of additions to the herbarium 

 and the study collection of moilusks, while eighteen moth-proof 

 tin cases have been purchased for the study series of birds and 

 mammals, in addition lo five large wooden ones uniform with those 

 provided last year. 



In the museum seven plate glass cases have been constructed 

 from the general appropriations and the income of the " Mary 

 Jeanes Museum Fund." Three of these are of large size, two for 

 birds and one for mammals, and cover collectively over six hun- 

 dred square feet of floor space. Two other cases have been pre- 

 sented by Mr. Clarence B. Moore, uniform with those already 

 installed, to accommodate the accessions to the " Moore Archseo- 

 logical Collection." The large slab of fossil ferns presented by 

 Mr. C. B. Nichols has also been enclosed in glass. 



The opening of the museum on Sunday afternoons has been con- 

 tinued tiiroughout the year, to the gratification of large numbers 

 of persons who are unable to visit it on weekdays. 



During the past summer the Academy has for the first time 




1901.] XATUKAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 767 



maintained a table at the Wood's Hole Biological Laboratory. 

 It was occupied through the season by Mr. H. W. Fowler. 



Much of the work accomplished during the past year in the 

 arrangement of the collections is described in detail in the reports 

 of tlie Botanical, Conchological, Ornithological and Mineralogical 

 Sections which follow, while the more important work of other 

 departments is briefly outlined below. 



Mr. Stone has spent the greater parf of the spring and summer 

 in the arrangement of the reptiles and batrachiaus, with the result 

 that all the groups not handled last year have been catalogued and 

 systematically arranged and many unidentified specimens named. 



Mr. Fowler has continued his studv of, and completely rearranged 

 and relabeled the carp-like and deep-sea fishes, the eels and their 

 allies, and the Cyprinodonts, comprising about two-fifths of the 

 entire collection. 



During the year the whole series of alcoholic vertebrates have 

 been carefully examined and the alcohol replenished. 



The mammalian skeletons and skulls have all been relabelled 

 with special tags and a systematic card catalogue of all the mammal 

 collections, has been prepared by Mr. Rehu. 



In the Archfeological department Miss H. N. Wardle has cata- 

 logued and arranged a large number of specimens, including most 

 of the Haldeman Collection. 



Through the generosity of Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, Jlr. C. W. 

 Jolmson has continued his care of the Isaac Lea Collection of 

 Eocene MoUusca. Sis hundred and fifteen species have been 

 added during the year, mainly through exchange. 



Many important additions to the collections have been received 

 since the preparation of the last report. The Zoological Society of 

 Philadelphia has presented a number of specimens, one of the 

 most notable being a full-grown Indian Rhinoceros, which has been 

 mounted by Mr. David McCadden, the taxidermist. 



Mr. Y. Hirase, of Kyoto, has continued to add most liberally 

 to the conchological collection, furnishing many rare and hitherto 

 unknown species. Mr. Arthur Erwin Brown has added largely to 

 the department of reptiles, while a fine series of Porto Rican fishes 

 was received from the United States Fish Commission. 



Dr. A. Donaldson Smith presented a number of valuable birds, 

 mammals and mollusks secured during his recent expedition to Lake 




768 PEOCEEDINOS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



Rudolf, Africa. Mr. Alfred C. Harrison, Jr., and Dr. H. M. 

 Hiiler, who are at present conducting an expedition in the interior 

 of Sumatra, have generously promised to the Academy such of 

 their collections as are pertinent to its work, a portion of the 

 material having been already shipped. 



The Curators would express the indebtedness of the Academy to 

 the late Thomas Meehan, Dr. P. P. Calvert, Theodore D. Rand, 

 Lewis Woolman, Charles Lrebeck and other members for aid in 

 various departments, as well as to the students of the Jessup Fund, 

 Miss H. N. WardJe, Edward G. Vanatta, James A. G. Rehn and 

 H. L. Viereck. 



Besides the frequent consultation of the collections by visiting 

 naturalists, specimens have been loaned for study to C. D. Beadle, 

 E. L. Morris, W. B. Scott, G. S. Miller, Jr., M. J. Rathburn, 



C. H. Ball, W. B. Clark, W. D. Matthew, B. L. Robinson, E.

REPORT OF THE CURATOR OF THE WILLIAM S. 

 VAUX COLLECTIONS. 



The Curator of the William S. Vaux Collections would respect- 

 fully report that the specimens added have been fewer than in 

 prior years, but have been unusually fine. Among them may be 

 particularly mentioned a crystallized native copper from Lake Su- 

 perior ; five tourmalines, including an unusually fine achroite, two 

 showing cat's-eye reflexions ; an excellent green tourmaline and 

 rubellite, and a very remarkable opal from Australia. 



Much interest has been manifested in the collections by the 

 visitors to the museum. 



Respectfully submitted, 



Theodore D. Rand, 



Curator.

REPORT OF THE BIOLOGICAL AND MICROSCOPICAL 



SECTION. 



The Section has held the usual meetings during the year with 

 increased membership. It has lost by death a valued member, 

 Mr. David S. Holman. 



The Conservator reports that the apparatus and slides belonging 

 to the Section are in fair condition, and some progress has been 

 made in cataloguing the latter. 



Additions during the year include thirty-six slides of wood sec- 

 tions purchased and twenty-six volumes, principally of microscopi- 

 cal journals, presented by Mr. Joliu C. Wilson. 



At a joint meeting with the Biological Society of the Univer- 

 sity of Pennsylvania, the latter was represented by Prof. Conklin, 

 who spoke upon " Fertilization and Inheritance," and the Section 

 by Mr. Frank J. Keeley, who gave a history of the " Develop- 

 ment of the American Microscope." Dr. Morris also spoke upon 

 the " Theory of Vibration." 



Communications have been made by Mr. Palmer on Spirogyra 

 and desniids; by Mr. Keeley on rock-inclusions, various appliances

REPORT OF THE CONCHOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The growth of the collection of moUusks during the year has 

 been satisfactory. The total number of accessions, 2,705, although 

 less than in several years, comprises a large amount of material 

 preserved in alcohol and also more species new to the collection 

 than have been added in any year since the A. D. Brown Collec- 

 tion was received. 



The chief accessions are as follows: Over 800 species of Japanese 

 luollusks received from Mr. Y. Hirase, of Kyoto, Japan; a large 

 lot of South Sea shells collected by C. D. Voy in 1872-3, and 

 presented by Mrs. Anuie P. Cope; a small series of shells from 

 Hawaii and Torres Strait, sent to our Treasurer, Jlr. Roberts, by 

 Mr. D. Tliaanum, consisting largely of species new to the collec- 

 tion, and a second collection from British East Africa from Dr. 

 A. Donaldson Smith. The scries of American mollusks has been 

 increased by about 200 species from the Galapagos and Cocos 

 Islands, collected by an expedition from Leland Stanford, Jr. 

 University; a selected series from the Gulf of California from 

 Mr. J. G. Malone, and a small series of C. B. Adams' Panama 

 shells; while Messrs. E. H. Ashraun, A. C. Billups, G. H. Clapp, 

 T. D. A. Cockerell, M. J. Elrod, J. H. Ferriss, Dr. Henry 

 Skinner, Bryant Walker, and many others have added valuable 

 material to the collection of United States mollusks, both dry and 

 in alcohol. A portion of this material has been worked up by Mr. 

 Vanatta and the Conservator in special papers. 



The Academy purchased 328 species of air-breathing proso- 

 branch snails new to the collection. Progress has been made in the 

 rearrangement of the Pelecypoda and the alcoholic collection. 

 The remainder of the Bulbmdidie and the genus Cerion have been 

 revised in the progress of monographs of these groups. 



The officers elected at the annual meeting, held December 5, 

 1901, are as follows: •

REPORT OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The usual meetings have been held and entomological communi- 

 cations of mterest and scientific value have been made by members 

 and associates. The attendance has been good, the average bein<. 

 tourteen persons. " 



Seven associates have been elected during the year. 

 The Entomological News and Proceedings of the Entomological 

 Section oj The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has 

 been continued with increased success. During the year the 

 twelfth volume has been completed with threl hundred and 

 twenty-eight pages and thirteen plates. 



The Section has had a very eventful year, due to the large and 

 valuable additions of specimens to the collections of the depart 

 ment. Two representative collections of Hymenoptera have been 

 presented: the Cresson Collection and the collection of Gallflies 

 made by Mr. Homer F. Bassett, of Waterbury, Conn The 

 former collection contains 2, .367 types and 3,511 species and the 

 number of specimens is estimated at 87,775. The Bassett Collec- 

 tion contains 315 boxes, estimated to contain 6,300 specimens and 

 over 300 types. The collection of Orthoptera made and presented 

 to the Section by Mr. J. A. G. Rehn numbers 1,653 specimens 

 In addition the Academy has purchased 3,500 specimens These 

 collections, m conjunction with the material already in the pcses 

 sion of_ the Section, form the best museum collection of these 

 insects in America. The Conservator has added over a thousand 

 specimens collected in San Miguel countv, N. M., durino- the 

 summer. About forty species of these ar; new to science," and 

 many are new to the collection. The specimens added to the cab- 

 inets during the year will number nearly 104,000. 




772 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



The collections are iu a good state of preservatiuu, but additioual 

 cases are needed and more space for the department is desirable. 



At the annual meeting, held December 2fi, the following were 

 elected to serve as officers for the year 1902: 



Director,

REPORT OF THE BOTAXICAL SECTION. 



The Botanical Section reports that the herbarium is iu a gener- 

 ally satisfactory condition. Much progress has been made in the 

 work of arrangement during the year. 



About 5,500 specimens have been added to the collections, 

 largely through purchase, the most important being a portion of 

 the collections of Mr. A. A. Heller, from Virginia, North Caro- 

 lina, Texas, Arizona, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and 

 California, numbering twenty-five hundred specimens and contain- 

 ing about 250 types, cotypes and authentic specimens, with many 

 from original type localities. These will add very materially to 

 the North American series of plants. 



Other purchases have been 129 specimens of Porto Rican plants 

 from A. A. Heller, 190 specimens of Mexican plants from C. G. 

 Pringle, 776 specimens of Canary Island plants from Dr. Theo- 

 dore Bornmuller, and 250 specimens of West Australian plants 

 from Dr. Pritzei. 



Donations numbering about 2,000 specimens have been received 

 from Col. C. A. H. McCauley, William M. Canby, Benjamin H. 

 Smith, Uselma C. Smith, C. F. Saunders, Witmer Stone, E. G. 

 Vanatta and Stewardson Brown. 



The mouutinir "f the general herbarium was completed in Septem- 




1901.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 773 



ber, largely through the untiring efforts of the late Mr. Meehan, it 

 having been his expressed desire to see this work accomplished dur- 

 ing his life, and strangely enough it was practically the last work 

 he was able to do in the herbarium. 



In the early part of (he present year the Curators had con- 

 structed eleven additional cases in the north room, which has 

 enabled the Conservator to rearrange all the specimens of the 

 Authophyta in the two rooms on the library floor, the Pteridophyta 

 being arranged for the present in the south room on the gallerj- 

 floor. 



All of the, eases have been marked on, the outside with printed 

 labels, in brass holders with transparent fronts, greatly facilitating 

 the reference to specimens. 



The mounting of the Charles E. Smith Herbarium was com- 

 pleted during the year, the local material being arranged in one of 

 the cases in the south room on the gallery floor ; the balance of the 

 specimens will be incorporated with the general collections during 

 the coming year. 



During the year much work has been accomplished on the C. 

 W. Short Herbarium, about ten thousand sheets having been 

 mounted, all of which will be incorporated with the general collec- 

 tions as rapidly as possible. It is the desire of the Conservator to 

 push this work during the coming year, so that the many valuable 

 specimens contained in this collection may be made available for 

 study at as early a date as possible. 



At the meeting of the Botanical Section, held on Monday, De- 

 cember 9, 1901, the following were elected as the oflicers to serve 

 for the coming year : 



Director, . . . .

REPORT OF THE MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOG- 

 ICAL SECTION. 



The Director of the Mineralogical aud Geological Section respect- 

 fully reports that uiue meetings have been held during the year, 

 besides six excursions to points of geological or mineralogical 

 interest. The average attendance at the meetings has been eight 

 members, on the excursions thirty -two. 



Additions to the Academy's collection of mineral aud geological 

 specimens include many of interest, though in number not as 

 great as in jirevious years. 



An elaborate paper was read before the Section by Mr. John S. 

 Ash on the Buckingham Fault, which elicited considerable discus- 

 sion, participated in by Messrs. Lyman, Woolman and others. 

 There were read also other papers on Arizona lignite, New Jersey 

 gravels, and on various questions relating to the geology of Penn- 

 sylvania. 



Mr. Frank J. Keeley exhibited a number of rock sections pre- 

 pared by himself, and made remarks upon them, particularly upon 

 their inclusions. 



The first excursion was made to Langhorue and vicinity, for the 

 examination of the New Red Rocks in that neighborhood, and to 

 Van Artsdalen's quarry ; the second and third to the vicinity of 

 Yardley and New Hope, the fourth to Lodel creek, near Grater's 

 ford on the Perkiomen, and to Skippack creek. At Lodel creek 

 a slab was obtained showing ripple marks and reptilian and 

 amphibian footprints. The fifth was to West Chester, where the 

 cabinet of Mr. W. W. Jefferis was inspected and also Mr. Sharp- 

 less' collection of Indian relics, after which a number of localities 

 in the vicinity were visited. The sixth excursion was to the fossil 

 beds in the Mattewan and other formations in the vicinity of 

 Swedesboro and Mullica Hill. 



The following officers of the Section for the ensuing year were 

 elected : 



Director, ..... Theodore D. Rand. 



Vice-Director, .... Benjamin Smith Lyman. 



Treasurer, .... Emma Waller.

REPORT OF THE ORNITHOLOGICAL SECTION. 



Duriug the past year a large part of the Couservator's time has 

 been occupied by his duties as assistant to the Curators in other 

 departments. It has, however, been possible to make considerable 

 progress in the rearrangement of the ornithological collections. 

 All of the mounted water birds, with the exception of the Anatldm 

 and Laridfc, have been carefully examined by the taxidermist, 

 relabeled with both common and teclmical names, and installed on 

 the oruithological floor of the new building. They completely fill 

 the large case erected last year, and show to much better advan- 

 tage than they did in the old gallery. During the close of the 

 present year three additional cases have been furnished by the 

 Curators, which it is estimated will accommodate about one-third 

 of the entire mounted collection. Labels for most of the remain- 

 ing water birds have already been prepared, and it is expected all 

 the new cases will be filled and the new floor opened to the public 

 in the spring. 



For the study collection eighteen moth-proof cans and three 

 large wooden cases have been purchased, permitting the abandon- 

 ment of almost all of the temporary storage boxes that we were 

 forced to make use of some years ago. With a similar provision 

 next year the entire collection of bird skins will be accommodated 

 in modern cases and rendered absolutely safe from moths and dust. 

 Considerable time has been required to effect the systematic arrange- 

 ment of the skins in the new cases, but as a result they are now 

 more accessible than ever before. The Mcllhenny collection of 

 Alaskan birds, which was formally acquired early in the year, has 

 been incorporated with the general collection, as also a valuable 

 local collection of water birds, the gift of Mr. H. W. Fowler. 



The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club and the Pennsylvania 

 Audubon Society have continued to hold their meetings in the build- 

 ing and have done a great deal to stimulate the study of birds at 

 the Academy. Much aid has been rendered during the year to 

 ornithologists in other institutions, both by correspondence and by 

 loan of specimens, and many visiting naturalists have made use of 

 the collections. 



Among other important additions to the department may be 

 mentioned a series of birds from Lake Rudolf, Africa, from Dr.
