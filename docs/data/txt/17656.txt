PROCEEDINGS 



OF THE 



ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES 



OF PHILADELPHIA. 



1859. 



January 4tli. 

 President Lea in the Chair. 



Forty-eight members present. 



Mr. W. Parker Foulke presented some cones found in April, 1858, by Mr. 

 Samuel I. Goucher, on a peak of the Blue Mountain, near Mount Holly Springs, 

 Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. 



Mr. Durand stated that he had examined these cones, with a few leaves ac- 

 companying them, and had no doubt they were from the Pinuspungens, or table 

 mountain pine, which he believed had not been previously recognized so far 

 north. 



January Will. 

 Dr. Carson in the Chair. 



Thirty-seven members present. 



Mr. Cassin read a letter from Mr, P. B. Duchaillu, dated Fernando 

 Vaz River, Western Africa, September 28th, 1858, containing the 

 following passages: 



" Since I left the Gaboon in 1857, I have explored the Camma or Fernando 

 Vaz river and the Ogobai river, which is a branch of the Camma, but was pre- 

 vented from ascending the latter by the natives. I have ascended also to the 

 distance of about two hundred miles the Rembo and the Ovenga rivers. 



"The country of the Nazareth and the Camma is intercepted by large rivers, 

 creeks and lagoons going in every direction into the interior, and to all of 

 which the natives have given distinct names. Some of these rivers are wide 

 and deep, and would be navigable for steamers to a great distance. In some 

 places the soil is very rich and in others sandy ; the ebony and red wood trees 

 are very abundant. 



" One of the most interesting facts that I have determined is, that the Cannibal 

 tribe (the Paueins) which I met with on the head waters of the river Muni, 

 seem to terminate in the interior, up the Nazareth river, the banks of which are 

 inhabited by various tribes calling themselves Orounga, Ogobai, Pandjai, 

 Aninga, Okanda and Apindgi ; none of these are cannibals, and they speak of 

 the Paueins as farther north and in the interior, and my conclusion is, that 

 this cannibal people either follow the mountains, which I think take here an 

 eastern direction, or that they cease. Up the Rernbo, which is the main branch 



1 [Jan. 




2 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



of the Fernando Vaz, the Bakalai tribes disappear ; then follow a people calling 

 themselves Ashira, and next to them come the Apindgi. 



"Up the Oveuga, I left it and went into the interior amidst the Bakalai people 

 and afterwards into the Ashira country. The Ashiras are quite a different peo- 

 ple from any that I have yet seen in Western Africa. They cultivate tobacco 

 extensively, and cotton to some extent also, but the principal cloth made by 

 them is from a kind of grass which is very fine. Food with this people is 

 abundant, and they are the only people I have yet seen in this country that had 

 domesticated hogs. 



" Immense forests, in which the ebony tree is very abundant, border the 

 banks of the Fernando Vaz, but at the highest point that I reached, the coun- 

 try was more open, and grassy plains frequently presented themselves. I was 

 assured by the natives that this was the character of the country still higher up 

 the river and its branches, and they speak of a large prairie and of a large lake 

 also further in the interior. The latter, as far as I can judge from the accounts 

 of the natives, is about 600 miles from the coast. At present my intention is 

 to make another journey about in the latitude of the Fernando Vaz in search of 

 this lake, which I have some hopes may prove to be the source of the Congo. 

 In this journey I may perhaps also ascertain the course of the mountains 

 that I reached in ascending the Muni river. 



I have made maps of all the rivers that I have ascended, and have, with much 

 difficulty, kept my journal without intermission, and hope to lay it before the 

 Academy on my return to the United States. I send by this vessel four boxes 

 and three barrels containing collections of quadrupeds and birds, in which are 

 many interesting specimens, and some that I have never collected before. All 

 are from the Fernando Vaz or Camma, the Ogobai, Rembo and Ovenga rivers." 



Dr. Leidy exhibited a drawing of the worm described by him at a 

 former meeting as Manayunkia speciosa. 



Dr. Leidy remarked, that perhaps some of the members present would recol- 

 lect he had some time since, (Proc. 1858, p. 90,) described a curious fresh 

 water worm, Manayunkia speciosa, from the river Schuylkill. It was observed 

 that it appeared to be most nearly allied to the marine genus Fabricia. During 

 the last summer, Dr. L. in company with Mr. Powel sought for the latter at 

 Newport, R. I. They found it in very great abundance at the foot of the cliffs 

 bathed by the ocean. In its curved tubes of tenacious mud, adhering to stones, 

 and with ito projecting tentacles, it very much resembles a ciliated polype, es- 

 pecially Plumatella. 



The worm is about U lines long, demi-cylindroid, with 12 annuli, of which 

 all except the first are setigerous. The cephalic annulus has a short proboscis ; 

 is provided with one or two pairs of eyes, and supports six arms with about 

 80 ciliated tentacles. The succeeding 7 or 8 annuli are provided on each side 

 with fascicles of from 5 to 7 setae and as many podal spines. The posterior 

 three annuli are provided on each side with fascicles of 2 setae and from 12 to 

 15 short podal spines. Anterior setae terminating in a linear lanceolate 

 blade ; posterior setae aristate. Anterior spines terminating in a hook which 

 is dentate on its convex border; posterior spines expanded at the extremity, 

 which is dentated on the convex border. Caudal annulus with a pair of eyes. 



Eyes exist in the cephalic and caudal annuli, also in the young worm. From 

 the "want of a good description and figures of the European species of Fabricia., 

 it was not to be determined whether the American species was different from it.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3 



Catalogue of Birds collected on the rivers Camma and Ogobai, Wes- 

 tern Africa, by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu, in 1858, with notes and descrip- 

 tions of new species, by John Cassin. 



Descriptions of two new species of tortoises, by John Le Conte. 



Geological Explorations in Kansas Territory, by F. B. Meek and F. 

 V. Hayden, M. D., 



And were referred to Committees. 



Dr. Morris described a new species of Pomotis very common in the vicinity 

 of Philadelphia, and characterised by a short auricular appendage and rounded 

 caudal fin. The numbers of the rays are as follows : 



D. 9-10. A. 3-9. P. 9. C. 16. V. 1-5. 



The dorsal, anal and caudal fins are covered with spots of a lighter color 

 than the fins themselves. The body of the fish is traversed by seven or eight 

 blackish bands, the first passing through the eye, the second near the margin 

 of the opercle, the third behind the pectoral, the fourth and fifth opposite the 

 dorsal, the sixth, seventh and eighth from opposite the end of the dorsal to the 

 root of the caudal. An opaline bluish spot is found on the opercular appen- 

 dage, the general color of which is black. This species approaches the P. 

 catesbei of Cuv. and Val. but is believed to be distinct. Dr. M. proposed for 

 it the name of Pomotis guttatus. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to some remains of cartila- 

 ginous fishes, discovered by Dr. F. V. Hayden and F. B. Meek, during the last 

 summer, in the carboniferous formations of Kansas. One of these is a muti- 

 lated dorsal spine included in a fragment of rock, from ihe upper carbonife- 

 rous formation of Leavenworth City. The spine may perhaps belong to one 

 of the same fishes, to which the other specimens appertain, but there was no 

 means at present to determine this fact. It was characterised as follows : 



Xystracanthus arcuatus Leidy. Spine much curved ; its posterior border 

 formiDg the segment of a circle whose diameter would be about 2 inches. 

 Length along the convex border, when perfect, about 2| inches. Lower ex- 

 tremity 3| lines wide. Section ovoid with the broader part posterior. Sides 

 of the spine finely ridged longitudinally, and furnished anteriorly with small, 

 oblique, hemi-elliptical tubercles ; posteriorly provided, on the two sides together, 

 with six rows of odontoid tubercles, of which those of the first row on each 

 side are minute, and of the last row are the largest. Osseous structure of the 

 specimen brown ; odontoid tubercles invested with smooth, shining gray, ename- 

 loid substance, demi-conoidal, those of the posterior pair of rows sometimes 

 coalescing across the back border of the spine and assuming a crescentoid 

 form. 



The second specimen was the fragment of a tooth, of a species of Cla- 

 dodus, obtained from the Manhattan upper coal measures. It was characterised 

 as follows : 



Cladodus occidentalis Leidy. Enameled crown, when perfect, about an 

 inch in length, demi-conical ; the outer convex side provided with narrow ob- 

 lique folds. Lateral denticles two, the outer one the larger. Base of the tooth 

 reniform, with a breadth of about an inch, and the short diameter about 5 

 lines ; lateral extremities provided with a pair of large ovoid tubercles, one 

 above the inner margin, the other below the outer margin. 



The third specimen is a tooth, apparently of Petalodus alleghaniensis,* 

 from the upper carboniferous rocks, near Fort Riley. It differs from the tooth, 

 upon which the species was originally founded, in no important point, except 

 that it is larger. The breadth of the crown is about twenty lines ; its height 

 on the convex side 10 lines, on the concave side 1 inch.

Description of two New Species of Tortoises . 

 BY JOHN LE CONTE. 



Kinosternum Henrici. Testa regulari-ovali, convexa, dorso subcarinato, 

 postice valde decliva, margine non dispanso, laterali perpendiculari, sterno 

 testam non omnino occludente, cauda longa, unguiculata. 



Habitat New Mexico. 



Head and neck dusky, on the top slightly varied with paler, beneath and on 

 the sides, including the jaws, thickly speckled with yellow. Upper jaw entire, 

 hooked. Chin with two small warts. Legs and tail dusky, fore feet with two 

 folds on the upper side ; hind legs squamous on the hinder side and likewise 

 with two folds ; tail black and rather long, furnished with a long, broad and 

 rather pointed nail. Shell brownish yellow, regularly elliptic, convex, very 

 declivous behind, with the remains of an evident keel on the three last scut;e, 

 anterior and posterior margins not expanded, the lateral perpendicular with 

 a considerable furrow for the greatest part of its length. Vertebral scutae im- 

 bricate, the first one triangular with the apex truncate, applied to the nuchal 

 and first marginal scuta, second, third and fourth urceolate, six-sided, the 

 lower side of the fourth very short, the fifth triangular with all the angles 

 truncate, so as to form a six-sided figure, of which the apical side is very short, 

 the two upper lateral sides long and incurved, the two lower lateral short and 

 perpendicular to the base which is doubly incurved so as to form a waving line ; 

 this scuta is applied to the two caudal marginals, the first lateral is irregularly 

 four-sided, the second and third five-sided, the fourth four-sided, the anterior 

 side straight, the superior oblique, the posterior curved first outward and then 

 inward, so as to fit into the sides of the fifth vertebral and the last marginal ; 

 the nuchal scuta is small and square ; the rest of the marginals except the last 

 one, the caudals being excluded, are oblong, more or less angled on the top; 

 the last one is larger than the rest, three-sided, pointed above and entering a 

 cavity between the last vertebral and the last lateral ; the base is straight and 

 the two sides curved ; the caudals are four-sided, the upper side curved. Ster- 

 num large and yellow, emarginate behind, jointed before by a ligament, be- 

 hind by a suture anteriorly closing up the box of the shell, posteriorly very 

 partially so ; gular scuta very large, triangular, pectorals irregularly four-sided, 

 the outer side a little wider than the inner, the lower side curved, the interior 

 anterior angle very obtuse, the interior posterior rather acute, the two exterior 

 right ; brachials triangular with the apex truncate, and the upper side incurved; 

 abdominals quadrangular, the membrane joining them with the femorals so 

 wide as to make the joint appear double, femorals quadrangular, the inner side 

 short, caudals right angled triangular. 



Length of the shell 4-7 inches, height 1-9, of head and neck 2'8, of the tail 2. 



This new tortoise was brought from New Mexico by Dr. T. C. Henry of the 

 United States Army, and by him through Mr. Cassin presented to the Academy. 

 It is an old individual. It appears that when young the scutas of the back are 

 marked with concentric striae, and no doubt the whole of the upper surface 

 varied in some degree with darker. When the K. odoratum is found in clear 

 water streams it is beautifully varied, thus, for instance, those found in the 

 Ogeechee river, in Georgia, which has a sandy bottom and is seldom or never

polluted with mud, they are marked on each scuta with diverging or radiating 

 lines of dnrker. 



I have not adopted Mr. Agassiz's name in describing this animal, as I do not 

 think that his arrangement of Kinosternoids founded on a proper basis. If I 

 were to adopt his classification, I should describe three of his genera as follows, 

 premising that I think it is offering a violence to nature to separate the two 

 first. 



KlNOSTERNUM. 



Sternum entirely closing up the box of the shell, with eleven scutae and eight 

 bones, there being no entosternal, but the whole piece may be divided longitu- 

 dinally from front to rear into two pieces, which are afterwards subdivided. 

 The sternum is bilobed, each lobe moveable from the side of the abdominals on 

 the posterior joint of the hyosternals and the anterior of the hyosternal bones. 

 By closing the two lobes it is enabled to cover entirely the head and limbs ; 

 the posterior lobe being as wide as any part of the sternum, there can be of 

 course but very small wings by which it is attached to the carapace. In fact 

 they are scarcely perceptible. The upper jaw is most frequently hooked and 

 the tail armed with a nail. 



Thyrosternum. 



This genus differs from the preceding in the shape and mode of attachment 

 of the sternum to the carapace, the number of bones and of scutae is the same, 

 but the wings are much longer; it has likewise two moveable lobes, the anterior 

 attached by suture at the sides and by ligament in the centre ; the posterior 

 one entirely by suture, both of them narrower than the opening of the carapace, 

 particularly the posterior one ; consequently the animal is not able to with- 

 draw its softer parts entirely from view. It is always emarginate behind, the 

 upper jaw is almost always hooked, and the tail generally armed with a nail. 

 The transitus from Kinosternum to Thyrosternum is so perfect, that it becomes 

 difficult in some instances to say to which genus a specimen belongs. 



Ozotheca. 



Sternum very much shorter and narrower than in the other two genera, con- 

 stituted in the same manner, but the gular plate is generally very small. It is 

 jointed like the others both before and behind. The upper lobe is quite movea- 

 ble, but the lower little so, inasmuch as the fourth scuta projects somewhat 

 beyond the suture connecting this part with the abdominals, but there is a wide 

 space above it filled with ligamentous matter, which allows of some degree of 

 motion. This joint early in life becomes immoveable. The anterior joint in old 

 animals is apt to become permanently soldered to the adjoining bone. The 

 wings are longer and uarrower than in the others. 



The following characteristics are common to all these three genera. The 

 chin is furnished with two or more small warts, and the feet have some folds or 

 large scales, the fore feet on the anterior side, the hind feet on the posterior. 

 They all have a strong musky odor. 

 ' Although it may appear perfectly proper to separate the last genus from the 

 two others, yet in Wagler's K. hirtipes a very near approach is made to 

 Ozotheca, it has a very narrow sternum, emarginate behind and the branchial 

 plate is quadrangular, very much resembling what we see in 0. odo?-ata, the 

 jugular scuta is large and triangular, the upper jaw hooked, and the tail ungi- 

 culate ; in these three particulars exactly like the T. Pennsylvanicum. In the 

 young of the 0. odorata it is impossible to distinguish the sternum from that of 

 the T. Pennsylvanicum, except by the form of the brachial scuta ; it is very 

 remarkable, however, that the first which in the adult state has the nuchal scuta 

 small and irregular in shape, when very young has it very large and perfectly 

 triangular. The most of the Kinosterna and Thyrosterna have the tail armed 

 with a nail. Whether any of the Ozotheca are thus furnished I do not know, 

 never having had an opportunity of examining more than two species (unless 

 Wagler's K. hirtipes is admitted to be one). Should one, however, be found 



1859.]

perfectly agreeing in every respect with the 0. odorata, with the tail unguicu- 

 late, I would not hesitate to say at once, that my learned friend's division was 

 unnatural. In all species that I have seen, except those brought from Mexico 

 by Mr. Pease, the posterior lobe of the sternum is emarginate behind, and is 

 but slightly moveable ; in the Mexican species, on the contrary, it is entire and 

 capable of entirely closing up the box of the shell ; in both cases the faculty 

 arises from the peculiar formation of the joint, being either sutural or liga- 

 mentous. 



The following is the distribution according to Mr. Agassiz's system of such 

 Kinosternoids as I have had an opportunity of examining. 



KlNOSTERNUM. 



Mexicanum, integrum, triliratum. 



Thyrosternum. 



Scorpioides, leucostomum, longe caudatum, pennsylvanicum, sonoriense and 

 Henrici. 



Ozotheca. 



Odorata, guttata, hirtipes ? 



The animal, the description of which follows, was somehow omitted in 

 my monograph in vol. vii. Proc. A. N. S.; it differs remarkably from others 

 of Mr. Agassiz's genus Kinosternum, in having the upper jaw not hooked, and 

 the tail not unguiculate. 



K. triliratdm. Head and neck above spotted with yellow, the spots on the 

 cheeks larger, beneath yellowish irregularly varied with dusky, jaws yellow 

 varied with black, the upper entire, not hooked. Chin with four small warts. Fore 

 legs above dusky, beneath yellowish brown with three plicae or large scales ; 

 hind legs cinereous brown with four large scales near the heel. Tail short, 

 black, pointed, without a nail at the end. Shell regularly oval, brown, very 

 convex, strongly tricarinate on the back, very declivous on the sides, the 

 outer edge of the margin sharp and projecting, the scutae with more or less 

 concentric striae, and others radiating from behind. Vertebral scuta? elon- 

 gated, imbricate, emarginate behind, the first triangular with the apex some- 

 what truncate and the base angled, applied to the nuchal and first marginal 

 only, the second, third and fourth hexagonal, the anterior and posterior sides 

 very short, the fourth with the two lower sides much shorter than the upper, 

 the fifth triangular with the apex truncate and the base a little angled ; the 

 first lateral is four-sided, the lower side with four facets, second and third pen- 

 tagonal, fourth irregularly five-sided ; the nuchal scuta is wider at the base, 

 the rest of the marginals square and oblong, increasing in size to the extremity 

 of the shell : sternum yellow, varied with black, entire and rather poised be- 

 hind, bivalved, completely closing up the box of the shell, wings very short, 

 applied partially to the fourth and entirely to the fifth, sixth and seventh mar- 

 ginal scuta?, all the scuta? of the sternum are concentrically striate; the gular 

 large, triangular, pectorals irregularly four-sided, the anterior side curved, 

 brachials triangular with the apices truncate and the base rounded, caudals 

 right angled triangular ; inguinal scuta long, rather wide, joining the axillary. 



Length of the shell 5 inches, height 2-5, tail -8. Brought from Mexico by 

 Mr. Pease. 



I conclude by observing that Mr. Agassiz thinks my K. Mexicanum is the 

 same as Mr. Bell's K. Shavianum. The author last named supposed that he 

 possessed the identical specimen from which Dr. Shaw made his figure. 

 There can be no doubt that Dr. Shaw's figure represents my K. Mexicanum, 

 although the shell is represented without a nuchal and without caudal 

 marginals. Mr. Bell's species has the tternum narrower than the shell, 

 and emarginate behind ; it undoubtedly belongs to the scorpioides. In the 

 seventh volume of Proc. A. N. S., in my description of this species, it is 

 said that the sternum is entire ; it is really shallowly emarginate. They 



[J; 



an. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7 



both belong to the genus Thyrosternum. Mr. Agassiz likewise thinks that my 

 Emys concinna and Dr. Holbrook's E. Floridana are the same. My friend will 

 pardon me when I say, that he probably has not had an opportunity of examin- 

 ing my species. There is no specimen in the collection of the Academy which 

 I can recognise as the animal once described by me. These two species are by 

 no means alike. The E. concinna is most beautifully smooth, nothing can be 

 more so; the E. Floridana is extremely rough with longitudinal rugae, it is besides 

 sometimes three times the size of the other, and the marks on the head and neck 

 are entirely different. According to this excellent naturalist the K. lonyicau- 

 datum and K. brevicaudalum of Spix, form but one species. They differ, however ; 

 the first has the sternum sharply emarginate behind, and the brachial scuta is 

 narrow, triangular and very much truncate at the apex. In the other the sternum 

 is bluntly emarginate behind and the brachial perfectly and acutely triangular. 

 Mr. Bell's scorpioides is not the animal described so long ago under that name, 

 as the want of the caudal nail sufficiently shews ; the specific name of this 

 tortoise was given it on account of that appendage. Neither is it the K. brevi- 

 caudatum nor the lonyicaudatum of Spix. This author thinks that the female 

 tortoises have long and the males short tails ; it is just the reverse. 



When my son was in Honduras, he obtained a species of tortoise much 

 larger than any that we have seen in the United States. The shell was nearly 

 two feet long; unfortunately this was afterwards destroj'ed, but the head and 

 limbs having been put into a jar of alcohol reached here in safety. In order 

 to keep alive the remembrance of this animal and to induce others to look for 

 it, I add a description of the head and tail, the only parts to which I can 

 have access at present, premising that it belongs to the genus Emys (Ptjxhe- 

 mys Agass.) and has the jaws serrate in the same manner as the E. niobiliensis . 



Emys valida. Head and neck above dusky inclining to brown, striped with 

 yellow, the stripes on the top very few, on the sides very numerous, one of them 

 running from the middle of the orbit to the back part of the neck, widens con- 

 siderably after it passes the superior part of the cheek; beneath yellow with 

 numerous lines of dusky; nose and jaws striped with yellow, jaws serrate, the 

 lower one hooked, the upper emarginate. Tail dusky with two yellow lines on 

 the top and three on the under side, the outer one of which on each side 

 branches off in such a manner as to surround the vent, above which it crosses 

 the tail transversely. Head 4 inches long, tail 3 inches. 



Sixty years ago, in the Tammany Museum in New York, there was the shell 

 of an Emys three feet long ; it had been used by an Indian as a shield and had 

 varied devices painted on it ; it was said to come from Lake Erie. Nothing like 

 this has since been seen, but I am told that in the head waters of the Missis- 

 sippi tortoises of an immense size and in great quantity have been observed. 



Since writing the above, Prof. Baird has called my attention to the Atlantic 

 Journal of Mr. Rafinesque, where there are some remarks on the tortoises of 

 the United States. This author names the Testudo Carolina, the Kerobates of 

 Agassiz, Gopherus ; his Cheliphus appears to be the true Kinosternum Agassiz, 

 the Vronyx the Thyrosternum of the same ; Didicla is the Cistudo, Chelopus is 

 Nanemys and Cheliurus is the Chelydra. 



Although it has become customary to pay no attention to any thing publish- 

 ed by this very indefatigable explorer of the productions of our country, I do 

 not think it right when a genus or a species has been announced as suggested 

 or discovered by him, to pass it over without notice. From an unfortunate 

 shipwreck in which he lost every thing that he possessed in the world, he be- 

 came disordered in his intellect. Notwithstanding his propensity for seeing 

 differences which were not apparent to others, many of his observations are 

 truly valuable, and no naturalist should think his labors perfect unless he has 

 searched through the many publications of this unfortunate naturalist, and dis- 

 covered whether or no he had been anticipated by him. No one seems ever to 

 have looked for his Opalone, a soft shelled tortoise with five nails, found in the 

 upper branches of the Hudson River.

Geological Explorations in Kansas Territory. 

 BY F. B. MEEK and F. V. HAYDEN. 



As it is merely our purpose, on the present occasion, to give rather briefly, 

 the results of some geological examinations made by us last summer in eastern 

 Kansas, it will perhaps scarcely be expected that we should here enter into a 

 historical review of the valuable labors of other explorers in that region. 

 Hence we proceed at once to present such facts as came under our observa- 

 tion, and the conclusions they seem to warrant. 



The route pursued by us while making these investigations, was first from 

 Leavenworth city on the Missouri, accross the country to Indianola, near the 

 mouth of Soldier creek, on the Kansas ; thence up the north side of Kansas and 

 and Smoky Hill rivers, to the mouth of Solomon's fork. Here we crossed the 

 Smoky Hill, and followed it up on the south side to a point near the ninety- 

 eighth degree of west longitude ; from which point we struck across the country 

 in a south east direction to the Santa Fe road, which we followed north east- 

 ward to the head of Cottonwood creek. Leaving the road here, we went down 

 the Cottonwood valley some thirty miles, when we turned across the country 

 nearly due northward to Council Grove. From the latter place we followed 

 the Santa Fe road back southwestward about twenty-four miles to a watering 

 place known as " Lost Spring ;" here we again left the road and struck across 

 the country in a northwest direction to Smoky Hill river, at a point nearly op- 

 posite the mouth of Solomon's fork. We then traveled down the south side of 

 Smoky Hill and Kansas rivers to Lawrence, where we crossed the Kansas and 

 proceeded in a northeast direction back to Leavenworth city. 



The first outcrop of rocks examined by us during the expedition is at a point 

 just below the steamboat landing at Leavenworth city. At this place and for 

 some distance above on the river, the formation is well known to belong to the 

 upper, but not the highest portions, of the great western coal measures. 



The section here near the Leavenworth landing, presents the following beds, 

 in descending order : 



Feet. 



1. Bluish gray clay, exposing a thickness of about 3 



2. Hard gray layer of Fusulina limestone l 



3. Yellow laminated clay 7 



4. Hard gray argillaceous limestone with Fasulina 1 



5. Gray fine grained argillaceous sandstone with fucoidal markings, 

 sometimes contains seams of limestone lto3 



6. Gray, green and blue, rather indurated clay, with sometimes near 

 the base many compact concretions limestone 2 



7. Hard light yellowish gray limestone, usually of bluish tinge far in 

 beyond the effects of weathering. Contains Spirifer cameratus, S. Ken- 

 tuckensis, S. lineatus, Spirigera subtilita, Orthisina 3Iissouriensis, Productus 

 splendens ? P. semireticulatus ? P. puslulosus and Fusulina cylindrica, together 

 with colums of Crinoids, and spines and plates of Archceocidaris ; also jaws 

 teeth of Xystracanthus arcuatus 15 



8. Dark shale, passing up into gray less distinctly laminated clay 5 



9. Hard dark bluish impure limestone, containing Fusulina cylindrica, 

 Spirigera subtilita, Productus Rogersi, P. Prattenianus, Area carbonaria? 

 an undetermined Monotis, Attorisma 9 Leavenworthensis, A. subcuneala, Mgalina 

 subquadrata, Leptodomus granosus, and a large Belerophon lg-2 



10. Gray, more or less laminated clay, becoming darker near the upper 

 part, rising above the river 11 



Attached to the surfaces of bed No. 9 there is usually from one to two inches 

 of soft dark argillo-calcareous matter containing great numbers of Orthisina 

 crassa, with the undetermined species of Pecten, Mytilus, Sckizodus, Pleuroto- 

 maria, &c. 



All this section above No. 1 appears to vary considerably, at different places 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 9 



some of the beds, being entirely wanting, or presenting quite different litbologi- 

 cal characters at other localities not far from here. Owing to the dip of the 

 strata, and partly to the fall of the river, the bed of limestone No. 7, which is 

 elevated eighteen feet above the river where this section was taken, rises as 

 much as twenty-five feet above the level of the river, at a distance of one mile 

 or less below ; and on following the outcrop of these rocks along the shore 

 above Leavenworth city, they were found to sink gradually beneath the water, 

 so that at Fort Leavenworth landing, two miles above, (in a north direction 

 from the exposure first examined) all of beds No. 8, 9 and 10, as well as two 

 or three feet of No. 7, were submerged. Should this dip continue at the same 

 rate, without local undulations, the whole of No. 7 must pass beneath the river 

 in less than two miles above the Fort. 



Immediately above No. 1 of this section, we saw no exposures of rock in 

 place, but on a small stream about two and a half miles below Leavenworth 

 city, and perhaps one and a half miles back from the river, there is an outcrop 

 of soft fine grained yellow sandstone, showing a thickness of twenty-four feet, 

 underlaid by a bed of blue clay of which a thickness of about four feet was ex- 

 posed. We had no opportunity to determine the elevation of these beds above 

 the river with sufficient accuracy to form a definite conclusion whether 

 or not they hold a position above the section seen near the Leavenworth land- 

 ing, though we incline to the opinion that they come in above it. 



In ascending the hills back of Leavenworth city we observed no outcrops of 

 rock along the slopes, until near the summit, where at an (estimated) elevation 

 of about two hundred feet above the highest bed of the section at the river, 

 there is an exposure of hard bluish-gray impure limestone, weathering to a 

 yellowish tinge, the beds of which are separated at places, by partings of clay. 

 Of this rock we saw a thickness of sixteen feet. It is much used for building 

 purposes and quarried rather extensively back of Fort Leavenworth .At one of 

 these quarries, amongst the loose material thrown out by the workmen we 

 found specimens of Spirifer cameratus, S. Kentuckensis, S. planoconvexa, S. hemipli- 

 cata, Spirigera subtilita, Productus semireticulatus, P. Noriooodi, Leplodomus 

 Topekaensis, Fusulina cylindrica, Tercbratula millepunctata, and fragments of 

 Crinoids, with Chtztetes and Fenestella of undetermined species. 



Above the quarry there is a slope of some forty or more feet to the summit 

 of the hills, apparently occupied by clays ; and the quarrymen informed us that 

 there is immediately under the bed of limestone an eight feet bed of clay, 

 beneath which they had made no excavations. 



West of this locality, the surface of the country soon descends gradually into 

 a depression connected on the north with the valley of a small stream flowing 

 into the Missouri above Fort Leavenworth. In this immediate neighborhood 

 the face of the country is slightly inclined to be hilly, but the soil is rich, and 

 the long gentle slopes are clothed in the spring and summer months with a 

 luxuriant growth of prairie grass. From several points near here, we had a 

 fine view of the broad rich valley, with its beautiful groves and scattering farm 

 houses along the little stream to the north of us. 



Beyond this, the road after passing over some undulations, ascends to the 

 summit of the country, which is rich elevated prairie land. At several places 

 near the upper part of the slopes some five or six miles from Leavenworth, we 

 met with outcrops of light grey limestone, apparently in ten to twelve inch 

 layers, containing Fusulina, Productus semireticulatus, Chcetetes, and small 

 Cyathophylloid corals. These beds probably belong to the same horizon as the 

 limestone near the top of the bluff's back of Leavenworth, or may even hold a 

 higher position. 



At Big Stranger creek, some fourteen or fifteen miles west of Leavenworth 

 city, the following section was abserved in descending order : 



Feet. 



1. Slope, without any exposure of rocks, 60 



2. Layers of limestone, weathering yellowish, containing Spirifer came- 

 ratus and Fusulina cylindrica 8 



1859.] 




10 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



3. Slope probably occupied by shale or clay 40 



4. Grayish yellow limestone, with Fusulina cylindrica and Spirigera sub- 

 tilita 5 



5. Bluish gray soft shale, or laminated clay with occasional harder 

 sandy seams 38 



6. Coal immediately overlaid by one inch of cone-in-cone J 



7. Bluish gray laminated clay or soft shale, extending down to the creek 18 

 Again, on Little Stranger creek, some twelve miles south west of Leaven- 

 worth city, there is a somewhat similar exposure, containing a twenty inch 

 bed of coal. This bed is worked to some extent on the land of Mr. Charles 

 Stone, where the following section may be seen in the descending order : 



Feet, 



1. Light gray, or bluish gray, soft calcareous sandstone with harder 

 layers containing much argillaceous matter, with Productus splendens ? 

 Myalina subquadrata, an undetermined Jllonotis, and many fucoidal mark- 

 ings ; exposing a thickness of 15 



2. Blue laminated clays more or less arenaceous above 26 



3. Coal If 



4. Bluish gray somewhat ferruginous clay rising above the creek 4 



We have no means of determining what relations the rocks composing these 



two sections bear to the exposure at Leavenworth, but we think- they hold a 

 position between the bed of limestone seen near the top of the hills back 

 of Leavenworth city, and the upper bed of the section near the Leavenworth 

 landing. 



Between Big Stranger and Grasshopper creeks, the road passes over a beauti- 

 ful rich prairie, elevated about 350 or 400 feet above the Missouri. In cross- 

 ing this prairie we met with no exposures of rock, the whole being covered by 

 heavy Quaternary deposits, into which wells have been sunk at several places, 

 from thirty to seventy feet without striking solid rock in situ. At one or two 

 places, however, we saw masses of limestone which had been quarried for 

 building purposes along a little stream two or three miles north of the road. 

 These contained amongst other fossils Spirifer cameratus, Orthisina umbraculum? 

 Fusulina cylindrica, and fragments of Fenestella, with spines and plates of Archao- 

 cidaris. We had no opportunity to examine the quarry from which this rock 

 was obtained, but were informed that the bed is some sixty or seventy feet 

 below the summit of the higher portions of the surrounding country. 



In descending from this elevated prairie into the valley of Grasshopper creek, 



at Osawkee village, we observed, 



Feet. 



1. A bed of hard gray limestone near the summit of the slopes, contain- 

 ing great numbers of Fusulina 8 



2. Slope, no rocks exposed, about 55 



3. Outcrop of Fusulina limestone, apparently 3 



4. Slope, no rocks exposed ."." ^ 



5. Gray or bluish gray limestone, weathering yellowish, containing 

 Pleurotomaria humerosa, P. subturbinata, and a large undetermined species 

 of Bellerophon ; also Allorisma ? Leavemuorthensis, Myalina subquadrata, 

 Pinna undt., Spirifer cameratus, S. planoconvcza and Productus aquicostatus, 

 with great numbers of Fusulina cylindrica 3 



6. Dark gray indurated clay 2 



7. Rather soft argillaceous limestone 4 



The fact that several of the fossils seen here in bed No. 4 are the same spe- 

 cies found in No. 5, of the section at Leavenworth landing, would seem to in- 

 dicate that these beds occupy the same geological horizon. It is very difficult, 

 however, to identify the same beds at different localities amongst these forma- 

 tions, in consequence of the fact that the fossils found in them usually have a 

 great vertical range, and exactly similar strata are often repeated in various 

 parts of the series. Should it prove *o be the case that they do occupy the 

 same geological horizon, it would show that there is here a gentle eastward 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 11 



dip ; for the lowest bed of this section on Grasshopper creek, cannot be less 

 than 100 feet higher than the base of the section at Leavenworth city. 



Still we incline to the opinion that the strata near here, if not almost hori- 

 zontal, or merely undulating, have a general inclination towards the west, or 

 somewhat north of west, and that the exposure on Grasshopper creek, is com- 

 posed of much more modern beds than those near the landing at Leavenworth 

 city. At any rate we saw an exposure at Lawrence landing, on the Kan- 

 sas, composed of ledges of limestone, overlaid by clay, and having a decided 

 dip to the west or north of west, at a rate of not less than fifty feet to the mile. 

 This limestone consists of an upper hard gray layer, about three feet in thick- 

 ness, resting on a soft gray arenaceous bed, of which some one or two feet were 

 visible above the surface of the river when examined by us. In these beds we 

 saw Spirigera subtilita, Productus splendens? and Myalina subquadrata. Above 

 these, about eleven feet of gray laminated clay were exposed, the upper part of 

 the bed having a more yellowish tinge, and containing more arenaceous matter 

 than the lower. 



If these beds continue to rise at the same rate towards the east, they must of 

 course run out on the summit of the highest part of the country not far east of 

 Lawrence ; and the same inclination to the west or north west, would take them 

 far beneath the horizon of the base of the section seen on Grasshopper creek. 



Above this exposure at Lawrence landing, there is a space of about 160 feet 

 in which no outcrops were seen excepting some red and blue clays near the 

 upper part of the hills, back of the town. Just above these clays, some ledges 

 of gray limestone were seen, apparently altogether about eight feet in thick- 

 ness, containing Fusulina cylindrica, Spirigera subtilita, and Spirifer cameratus. 



West of Grasshopper creek, on both sides of the Kansas, the country becomes 

 lower near the river, but at a distance of some ten or twelve miles back, on the 

 north side, it appears to be nearly as elevated as on the east of Grasshopper 

 creek. Between this higher country and the Kansas, there is a plateau, appa- 

 rently elevated not more than sixty feet above the broad level prairie bottoms 

 along the river; while on the south of the Kansas, some five or six miles south 

 west of Topeka, there are some isolated hills apparently of the same elevation 

 as the high country north of the Kansas. 



At several places soon after crossing Grasshopper creek, we met with some 

 highly fossiliferous beds along the small streams, at an elevation of apparently 

 about eighty feet above the Kansas. Below we give a section of these beds 

 seen at a locality some eight miles south west of the point where the exposures 

 mentioned on Grasshopper creek were observed : 



Feet. 



1. Rough seams and layers of concretionary limestone of bluish tinge 

 with partings of clay, containing Terebr alula millepunctata, Spirigera subtilita, 

 Spirifer cameratus, S. Kenluckensis, Retzia Mormonii, Rhynchonella Uta, Pro- 

 ductus Norwoodii,P. splendens ?P. semireticulatus, P. Prattenianus, Orthisina, 

 similar to 0. umbraculum, also Fenestella and Chcetetes of undetermined 

 species 4 



2. Black shale, shading upwards gradually into laminated blue clay 2\

 Myalina, Fecial, c 1 



4. Bluish gray soft clay, with seams of hard limestone 3 



5. Light gray, somewhat granular limestone with a few round grains, 

 and very small pebbles of quartz 2 



At another place on the south side of the Kansas, about twelve miles south 

 west of the point where the last section was seen, there is an abrupt bluff near 

 the old Baptist Mission, composed of the following beds in the descending 

 order : 



Feet, 



1. Slope, no rocks exposed 20 



2. Hard yellowish gray limestone, with fragments of fossils 4 



3. Slope, no rock exposed IS

After passing this locality, we heard of a coal mine some three or four miles 

 south of here, near the base of an isolated hill, known as Shunganunga Mound. 

 We did not visit this mine, but were informed that it is considerably above the 

 summit of the last section, and that the bed is about 18 inches in thickness. 

 The coal is said to be of good quality. 



Above here on both sides of the Kansas, the country continues to be rather 

 low, no part of it being apparently more than two hundred feet above the river. 

 For a long distance above this, there is a beautiful broad, level bottom prairie, 

 on the nonh side of the Kansas, extending back from four to six miles, and as 

 much as eighteen or twenty miles along the river. Bounding this on the north, 

 the country rises by a gentle grassy slope to an elevation of from sixty to about 

 one hundred feet, furnishing the most beautiful sites for dwelling houses. 



For a considerable distance above the locality where the exposure near the 

 old Baptist Mission was examined, the hills especially near the river on the 

 south side, appear to be mainly composed of rather heavy deposits of laminated 

 clays and shales, with soft sandstones and occasional thin beds of limestone, 

 containing the usual fossils of the upper carboniferous series. At the crossing 

 of Mission creek, at an elevation of perhaps not more than twenty-five or 

 thirty feet above the Kansas, exposures were observed consisting first above of 

 five feet of light gray laminated clay, resting upon two or three feet of soft 

 yellow sandstone, which passes down into laminated arenaceous clays, of which 

 some eight or ten feet were exposed above the creek. 



Some fifteen or sixteen miles west of the point where the road crosses Mis- 

 sion creek, at a locality six or seven miles south of the Kansas, there is a high 

 elevation known by the name of Buffalo mound, rising as much as four hun- 

 dred and fifty or sixty feet above the river. At one place a large creek called 

 on the maps, Upper Mill creek, sweeps close along the northern base of this 

 elevation, and has carried away the loose debris so as to leave the lower strata 

 well exposed. The section here beginning at the summit of this hill is, 



Feet. 



1. A slope of about 160 feet, along the lower forty feet of which we 

 found loose specimens of Spirifer cameratus, S. planoconvexa, Eetzia Mor- 

 monii, Productus splendens? Chenctes Verneuiliana, C. mucronata, and Fusulina 

 cylindrica, var. veniricosa, with fragments of Chcetetes, Crinoids, c, of unde- 

 termined species 



2. Bluish gray limestone in two layers, the upper of which contains 

 columns of Crinoids, Productus Calhounianus, #c, while Myalina subquad- 

 rata, Orthisina Missouriensis, Allorisma, Pinna, Monolis, Sfc, of undetermined 

 species, occur in the lower 3 



3. Slope with no exposures of rock 96 



4. Rather hard mottled brown and light gray compact limestone, with 



a few Orinoid columns ; may be thicker, but only showing a thickness of.... 3 



5. Brown, whitish and green clays, with rugged white calcareous con- 

 cretions 4 



6. Fine argillaceous sandstone, with streaks of yellow and brown colors.. l 



7. Ash colored clay 10 



*There may be some thin beds of limestone in this portion of the section, as every 

 part of this ninety foot bed was not well exposed, 



[[Jan.

8. Clays of red or brownish colors above ; blue and green below 3| 



9. Deep brown clay, with rugged concretions of same color ... 3 



10. Hard light bluish limestone, with some rather large columns of 



Crinoids, Choneles, Vernez/iliana, Sfc 2J 



11. Brown, ash colored, and blue laminated clays, which are more or 

 less arenaceous, with near the middle some 5 or 6 inches black shale 46 



12. Gray and purple argillaceous limestone, with Pinna, Productus, 

 and a few Fusulina 1^ 



13. Green laminated clay 4 



14. Two or three layers of soft fine grained sandstone, more or less ar- 

 gillaceous, and separated by seams of clay 2 



15. Bluish and ash colored clays 21 



16. Alternate layers of hard bluish gray limestone, and seams of clay 

 with sandy concretions 3 



17. Rather hard yellowish limestone, with Fusulina 2 



18. Ash colored clay, not very well exposed 15 



19. Yellowish impure limestone with Fusulina 2 



20. Ash colored laminated clays above the creek 5 



About three hundred yards below where this section was taken, the creek 



was observed to fall nearly a foot, over a ledge of hard limestone ; and one 

 mile further down, the bed of the creek is composed of a hard yellow lime- 

 stone containing great numbers of Fusulina. At these localities Mill creek is 

 probably not elevated more than thirty feet above the Kansas. 



Near half a mile east, or south east, of the point where the Fusulina lime- 

 stone was seen in the bed of Mill creek, and at a somewhat higher elevation, 

 we saw apparently the same bed of Fusulina limestone showing a thickness of 

 three feet. Under this there was at one place exposed a thickness of some 

 four or five feet of very fine yellow sandstone with minute specks of Mica. 

 These exposures indicate a moderate dip of the strata towards the west or 

 north west. 



On the north side of Kansas, in a direction a little west of north, and about 

 sixteen miles from the last mentioned localities, we observed an outcrop on a 

 small stream marked " Last Creek" on the maps, presenting the following sec- 

 tion, descending : 



Feet. 



1. Seams yellow magnesian limestone, alternating with clay, showing a 

 thickness of about 8 



2. Yellow soft granular magnesian limestone, containing Productus Nor- 

 woodi, and an undetermined species of Myalina 4 



3. Fine laminated black shale 1 



4. Gray rather soft argillaceous limestone 1 



5. Blue somewhat indurated very fine calcareous clay containing at its 

 junction with the next bed below, Chonctes, Synocladia biserialis, Chcstetes, 

 and fragments of Crinoids 9 



6. Seams hard, compact gray limestone, alternating with softer argillo- 

 calcareous matter, and containing casts of many small Cypricardia-like 

 shells, small Murchisonia, Pleurotomaria, Macrocheilus, Naticopsis, Bcllero- 

 phon } &c 2 



7. Bluish laminated clays weathering to drab color 4 



8. Yellow rather soft granular magnesian limestone, with embedded 

 fragments of harder more compact do o 



9. Bluish indurated calcareous clays 3 



The base of this section is evidently not elevated much above the Kansas, 



as it extends down to the bottom of a deep ravine formed by the creek, while 

 its top appeared to be nearly on a level with the surface of the bottom prairie in 

 the Kansas valley. These beds dip a little to the north west, and are very si- 

 milar, especially the magnesian limestones, to some of the Permian strata hold- 

 ing a position far above this in the series, some considerable distance west of 



1859.]

here. Only about three miles further west, we saw the following exposure on 

 Vermilion creek : 



Feet. 



1. Slope of about fifteen feet, with near the base some ledges of gray lime- 

 stone, amongst loose fragments of which we picked up specimens of" Spiri- 

 gera subtilita, Spirifer hemiplicata, Productus Norwoodi, and P. splendens? ... 15 



2. Slope, no rock seen 26 



3. Soft bluish and gray more or less laminated clays with irregular 

 sandy seams and concretions 12 



4. Irregular hard blue calcareous seam one to six inches & 



5. Blue clay 2 



6. Soft decomposing more or less laminated sandstone 4 



7. Blue clay one foot above the creek 1 



Almost directly opposite these localities, on the south side of the Kansas, 



some three or four miles back from the river, and nearly on a line between the 

 locality where we saw the exposures on " Last Creek " and Buffalo mound, 

 but considerably below the level of the summit of the latter, we examined 

 some exposures presenting beneath a slope of about eighty feet, in descend- 

 ing order : 



Feet. 



1. Hard bluish gray limestone of which there was exposed 1 



2. Rough yellowish magnesian limestone with cavities lined with chal- 

 cedony 3 



3. Bluish and ash colored clays 5 



4. Layer much like No. 2 1 



5. Yellowish green clay 20 



6. Bluish gray limestone in two layers, the upper of which contains 

 columns of Crinoids, Productus Calhounianus, &c, while Myalina subquad- 

 rata, Orthisina Missouricnsis, Allorisma, Pinna, Monotis, &c, occur in the 

 lower 3 



7. Bluish and ash colored clays exposing a thickness of 5 



The bed No. 6 of this section is evidently the same as No. 2 of the section at 



Buffalo mound (page 12), though here the dip of the strata has brought it 

 lower. Its elevation above the Kansas at Buffalo mound must be about two 

 hundred and fifty feet. "We had no means of estimating very accurately its 

 elevation where the last section was taken, though we do not think it as much 

 as one hundred and seventy-five feet above tbe Kansas. 



Ten miles farther west, on the same side of the river, along a small, stream 

 marked " Deep creek " on the maps, at a point some four or five miles back 

 from the Kansas, and elevated perhaps as much as forty feet above it, some 

 outcrops were examined near Zeandale, presenting the following section, de- 

 scending : 



Feet. 



1. Long slope of about one hundred feet, no rocks seen 100 



2. Dark argillaceous limestone, stained with iron, and containing frag- 

 ments of Crinoids 4 



3. Soft decomposing argillaceous limestone 2 



4. Very hard light yellow compact limestone in one massive bed, con- 

 taining great numbers of Fusulina, also Productus Calhounianus, &c 6 



5. Ash-colored laminated clay 22 



6. Hard decomposing argillaceous limestone with Fusulina 3 



7. Blue, green, and ash-colored clay 18 



8. Gray argillaceous limestone, with more or less ferruginous matter... 3 



9. Light bluish clay somewhat laminated..... 7 



10. White decomposing argillaceous limestone with Productus Calhoun- 

 ianus 1 



We heard of a bed of coal some four or five miles above this on the same 

 creek, but were unsuccessful in an attempt to find the locality where it crops 

 out. We were informed, however, by Mr. Pillsbury, an intelligent gentleman 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 15 



living at Zeandale, that the bed is from four to six inches in thickness, and 

 overlaid by about three and a half feet of blue shale, strongly impregnated 

 with alum. Above the latter, he said there is an eight or ten inch layer of dark 

 argillaceous material, weathering to an iron rust color, and containing many 

 nodular concretions, perhaps of carbonate of iron. From the information 

 obtained in regard to the location and elevation of this coal bed, we are in- 

 clined to believe it must hold a position a little below the horizon of the mid- 

 dle of the slope at the top of the foregoing section. It is probably the 

 highest bed of coal in the whole series of this region, at any rate we saw no 

 indications of coal above it. 



About a mile or a mile and a half north of the locality where this coal bed 

 has been seen, the dividing ridge between the Kansas and Deep creek, rises to 

 an elevation of near three hundred and twenty feet above the latter stream at 

 the nearest point. Here at the summit of this ridge there are some thin out- 

 crops of gray and whitish argillaceous limestone, showing on weathered sur- 

 faces a somewhat laminated structure, and containing at places large spines of 

 a species of Archaocidaris ; beneath this there is about two feet of gray frag- 

 mentary limestone reposing on a more compact bed of hard gray limestone 

 near three feet in thickness, and often cellular in the middle. Along the slope 

 about one hundred and twenty feet below the horizon of these beds, we found 

 loose specimens of Spirifer cameratus, Orthisina wnbraculum? Rhynchonella Ula,Al- 

 lorisma, Synocladia biserialis, &c. Just below these, there were many loose slabs of 

 light yellowish fine grained calcareous sandstone, containing Productus, Pecten, 

 and Fucoidal markings. About forty-seven feet lower down the slope, and 

 near one hundred and fifteen feet above the level of the Kansas, there is an 

 exposure of light grayish yellow granular limestone, showing a thickness of 

 three feet, in which we only saw fragments of a Choneles, and Crinoid columns : 

 large tabular masses of this rock were strewed along the slope for some distance 

 below. 



At the mouth of Big Blue river, on the south side of the Kansas, there is an 

 abrupt bluff, along which several slides have exposed many of the beds com- 

 posing the high ridge mentioned six or seven miles below here. The dip, how- 

 ever, of the strata towards the west, or north west, is so great that the lime- 

 stone containing spines of Archceocidaris, seen on the summit of the ridge be- 

 low this, at an elevation of about 320 feet above the Kansas, is here, opposite 

 the mouth of Big Blue river, only elevated about 214 feet above the Kansas ; 

 consequently the three feet of grayish yellow limestone cropping out 115 feet 

 above the Kansas along the slope of the ridge above mentioned, at the mouth 

 of Blue river, has sunk beneath the level of the Kansas. 



This far we have scarcely attempted to draw parallels between the various 

 beds seen by us at different places, in consequence of the fact that our obser- 

 vations were isolated, as must necessarily be the case in a mere reconnois- 

 sance, extended over a large area in a short space of time. In addition to this, 

 the group of rocks examined presents no extensive beds of limestone or other 

 hard material, forming well marked horizons, or continuous lines of outcrop, 

 by which the relations between strata seen at different localities could be traced 

 out. This difficulty is also greatly increased by the frequent repetition of pre- 

 cisely similar beds at different horizons in the series, and above all by the 

 great vertical range of the organic remains. Consequently we have pre- 

 ferred to present separately the local sections examined, instead of attempting 

 to construct a continuous general vertical section showing the order of super- 

 position of the various strata. To do this successfully throughout all the va- 

 rious rocks of the whole Kansas valley, would require much more time than 

 we had at our command. 



As our examinations along the Kansas and Smoky Hill rivers above this 

 point were made in more detail, where the outcrops were more frequent and 

 continuous, we have, as we believe, been able to trace out the connections and 

 order of succession of the various strata with considerable accuracy. Hence, 

 we give below a general section of the rocks in this region, commencing with 

 1859.]

the Cretaceous sandstones on the summits of the Smoky Hills, lat. 38 30 / N., 

 long. 98 W., and descending through the various intermediate formations 

 seen along the Smoky Hill and Kansas rivers, to the base of the bluff already 

 mentioned, opposite the mouth of Big Blue river, on the Kansas. It is true, 

 there are a few gaps in this section, where we were unable to see the beds 

 along some of the slopes, but as we know the position in the series, as well as 

 the extent of these gaps, it will be easy to determine, when a greater number 

 of exposures have been examined, the nature of the beds occupying them. 



General section of the Rocks of Kansas Valley from the Cretaceous down, so as to 

 include portions of the upper Coal measures. 



Feet. 



1. Red, brown, and yellowish, rather coarse grained sandstone, often 

 obliquely laminated, and containing many ferruginous concretions ; also, 

 fossil wood and many leaves of dicotyledonous trees, some of which belong 

 to existing genera, and others to genera peculiar to the Cretaceous epoch.

5. Bluish, red, light yellow, and gray clays, and soft claystones, with 

 sometimes a few thin layers of magnesian limestone. In many places 

 these clays have been traversed in every direction by cracks, into which 

 calcareous and argillaceous matter have found their way, and subsequently 

 become consolidated so as to form thin seams of impure yellowish 

 limestone, which cross and intersect each other at every angle. The 

 red clays are usually less distinctly laminated, contain more arenaceous 

 matter, and often show ripple marks on the surfaces. Locality, Bluffs along 

 Smoky Hill river, above the mouth of the Grand Salme 60

The foregoing general section of the strata seen along the valley of Kansas 

 and Smoky Hil! rivers, from the mouth of Blue river to the 98th degree of 

 west longitude, is presented in its present form more with a view of illustrat- 

 ing the vertical range of the organic remains found in these rocks, than as an 

 attempt to group the beds into formations that may be expected to preserve 

 their distinctive lithological characters throughout areas of any great extent. 

 As this has necessarily been done from a knowledge of only a portion of the 

 fossils characterizing these strata, it is quite probable, when more extensive 

 collections are obtained, that it may be found necessary even on this principle, 

 to classify and group the beds somewhat differently. We are also aware that, 

 some of these beds probably increase or diminish greatly in thickness, or may 

 even entirely thin out, at no very great distances from the localities where we 

 saw them. 



Among the more peculiar features of the series of rocks represented by this 

 general section, and in part by the preceding local sections, may be mentioned 

 first, the great number of thin layers and beds ; and secondly, the frequent 

 repetition of similar beds at various horizons. Again, the almost entire ab- 

 sence of heavy massive strata of limestone, or other hard material possessing 

 sufficient durability to form perpendicular escarpments of much extent, is 

 worthy of note. As a general thing, the limestones vary from only a few inches 

 in thickness, to from one to three or four feet, and rarely, as in Nos. 14 and 18, 

 attain a thickness of from thirty-eight to forty feet. Although various light 

 colored laminated clays, and soft argillaceous shaly beds predominate, and

arenaceous material is not unfrequently present, it is somewhat remarkable, 

 that dark bituminous shales and beds of coal are rarely met with, even among 

 the outcrops seen along the Kansas, below the mouth of Blue river, belonging 

 to the upper coal measures, and holding a position below the base of the fore- 

 going general section ; while through a considerable thickness of beds belong- 

 ing to higher portions of the coal measures included in the lower part of this 

 section, as well as through the strata containing Permian fossils above, beds of 

 coal and dark carbonaceous shales appear to be almost, if not entirely wanting. 

 It will be observed we have in this general section, without attempting to 

 draw lines between the systems or great primary divisions, presented in regular 

 succession the various beds with the fossils found in each, from the Cretaceous 

 sandstone on the summits of the Smoky Hills, down through several hundred 

 feet of intermediate doubtful strata, so as to include the beds containing Permian 

 types of fossils, and a considerable thickness of rocks in which we find great 

 numbers of upper coal measure forms. We have preferred to give the section 

 in this form because, in the first place, the upper Coal measures of this region 

 pass by such imperceptible gradations into the Permian above, that it is very 

 difficult to determine, with our present information, at what particular horizon 

 we should draw the line between them, while on the other hand, it is equally 

 difficult to define the limits between the Permian and beds above, in which we 

 found no fossils. 



Beginning near the base of this section, we find we have in great numbers 

 the following well known and widely distributed Coal measure fossils, viz. : 

 Fusulina cylindrical Chonetes Verneuiliana, Productus splendens, (or a closely al- 

 lied species,) Retzia Mormonii, Rhynchonella Uta, Spirigera subtilita, Spirifer ca- 

 meratus, S. planoconvexa, and a Euomphalus similar to E. rugosus of the Coal 

 measures, while the few new and undetermined species associated with these, 

 are, tor the most part, also decidedly more nearly allied to Carboniferous than 

 Permian forms. We should here remark, however, that we occasionally met 

 with a species of Monotis, allied to the Permian species M. Speluncaria and Sy- 

 nocladia biserialis, also regarded in the old world as a Permian genus, at horizons 

 far beneath the base of this section, between Manhattan and the Missouri. We 

 even found a single specimen of this Monotis as low down as bed No. 9, of the 

 section taken near the landing at Leavenworth City, which must occupy a 

 position several hundred feet below the lowest beds of the above section. Still 

 as this shell is very rare in these lower rocks, and the Synocladia is a distinct 

 species from the well known Permian form of the old world, while they are 

 both, at these horizons, associated with great numbers of the common well 

 known Coal measure species we can only regard their presence in these beds as 

 establishing the existence of these genera at an earlier period in this country, 

 than in the old world. This, it seems to us, is more philosophical than it 

 would be to place all this great thickness of strata, with their vast numbers of 

 well known Coal measure species, in the Permian, merely because we also find 

 with these occasionally a few forms which would in the old world be regarded 

 as characteristic of the Permian epoch. 



Taking it for granted then, that we have carried this section down far enough 

 to include, not only all the beds containing almost exclusively Permian forms, 

 but a considerable portion of the upper Coal measures, it will be interesting 

 to notice, as we ascend in the series, how far each of the Coal measure species 

 mentioned in the lower part of the section, as well as of a few others that occur 

 above and below, range upwards. Thus we see that Fusulina cylindrica var. 

 Ventricosa, Chonetes Verneuiliana and Retzia Mormonii were not met with above 

 division No. 37 ; while Spirifer planoconvexa,Productus splendens ? and Rhynchonella 

 Uta, were not observed above 34, nor Spirifer cameralus above 32. Fusulina 



* In Russia, Fusulina cylindrica is said to occur only in the upper part of the lower 

 Carboniferous series; but the fossil generally referred to that species in this country, 

 appears to be confined to the Coal measures. We have some doubts in regard to it* 

 identity with the Russian species.

cylindrica, of the slender variety so common in the Coal measures of Kansas 

 and Missouri, was not seen above 22; nor was any species or variety of 

 that genus observed above this horizon. 



Apparently, the same species of Monotis, mentioned at various horizons far 

 beneath, were occasionally met with in 30, 25, 23, and 20, generally associated 

 with the same species of Synocladia, ranging far down into the upper Coal 

 measures. In division No. 19, we again met with the Synocladia biserialis, and 

 a Spirigera allied to S. subtilita, if not identical, along with a new species of 

 Chonetes we have called C. murcronata, which ranges down into the beds near 

 the base of the section. Along with these, were also Productus N~orwoodi, and 

 Orthisina, Shumardiana, both of which are common in the Coal measures far 

 below, and a large Orthisina similar to 0. umbraculum, but apparently more 

 findy striate. 



Ascending through the intermediate beds to No. 12, we continue to meet with 

 nearly all the species mentioned in 19, with the exception of Chonetes mucronata. 

 We also have, first in 18, a large species of Productus, called P. Calhounianus 

 by Professor Swallow ; very similar to some varieties of P. semireticulatus, but 

 thought by Prof. S.,to present well marked internal differences. There is likewise 

 added in 16, a large Allorisma and a Spiriger similar to S. subtilita, hut much 

 more gibbous ; and in 14, Distina tenuilineatus, together with apparently the 

 same Monotis, so often mentioned below. In 12, we also have added a small 

 Spirifer, similar to S. lineatus, but perhaps more nearly allied to the Permian 

 species Martinia Clannyana, King. 



The succeeding bed above, No. 11, appears also to contain a mingling 

 of Permian with Coal measure forms, for we have in it the following Permian 

 types, viz.: My aim a very similar to M. Squamosa, Pleurophorus ? subcuneata, 

 Bakevellia parva and Monotis Haumi along with a Euomplialus near E. rugosus, 

 the same gibbous Spirigera, similar to S. subtilita, Orthisina umbraculum? and 

 O. Shumardiana. 



On passing into the next division above, No. 10, we find we have lost sight 

 of all the characteristic Carboniferous forms, unless the Spirigera mentioned in 

 some of the beds below be regarded as only a variety of S. subtilita, from which 

 however, we think it specifically distinct ; for with this exception, nearly all the 

 fossils seen by us in this division, are such as would be regarded as Permian 

 types. Although the number of species found by us in No. 10 is not great, 

 individual specimens are often numerous. Above this horizon we saw no more 

 fossils through a great thickness of various colored clays, claystoues, &c, until 

 ascending to the Cretaceous sandstones crowning the Smoky Hills. 



If we do not admit the existence in this region of an intermediate group of 

 rocks, connecting by slight gradations the Permian above, with the Coal meas- 

 ures below, and must draw a line somewhere, below which all is to be regarded 

 as Carboniferous, and all above as Permian, we should certainly, upon palae- 

 ontological principles alone, carry this line up as far as the top of division 

 No. 11. The passage from the Carboniferous to the strata, containing Per- 

 mian types, however, is so gradual here, that it seems to us no one, under- 

 taking to classify these rocks without any knowledge of the classification 

 adopted in the old world, would have separated them into distinct systems, 

 either upon lithological or palaeontological grounds, especially as they are not, 

 so far as our knowledge extends, separated by any discordance of stratifica- 

 tion, or other physical break.* Indeed the fact that some of the Permian types 

 occurring in No. 10, were first introduced in beds below this, containing many 

 Carboniferous species, would seem to indicate that even No. 10, may possibly 



* We have been informed by Dr. J. G. Norwood, former State Geologist of Illinois, 

 that the rocks in that State, referred by him and others to the same epoch as the Kansas 

 Permian beds, rest unconformably upon the Coal measures. This, however, would be 

 impossible in Kansas, since no disturbances of the strata occurred there, until after the 

 close of the Cretaceous era, which would, of course, not only cause the Cretaceous and 

 Carboniferous, but all intermediate beds, to dip at the same angle. 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 21 



have been deposited just before the close of a period of transition from the con- 

 ditions of the Carboniferous, to those of the Permian epoch. 



The apparent absence of fossils in the beds above No. 10, renders it impossi- 

 ble, with our present information, to determine with certainty the upper limits 

 of the series containing Permian forms. It is true, there is at places a 

 kind of conglomerated mass, occupying the horizon No. 9, which might appear 

 to form a natural line of division between the beds containing the Permian 

 fossils, and those above, in which we found no organic remains ; but this 

 seems to be local, and although there is a new feature presented by the zone 

 of gypsum deposits above it, we find between the beds and layers of gypsum, 

 and far above the horizon at which they occur, bluish, greenish, and other 

 colored clays, not only similar to those between the beds and layers of limestone 

 containing the Permian fossils in division No. 10, but also precisely like the 

 laminated clays between the beds of limestone of the upper Carboniferous 

 series far below. Again, in these clays of the gypsum zone, as well as through 

 a considerable thickness of clays above it, there are occasional seams of clay- 

 stone, which sometimes pass into seams of magnesian limestone, exactly like 

 some of those containing Permian fossils, in division No. 10. We saw no 

 fossils in these seams amongst the gypsum bearing beds, nor higher in the 

 series, but it is probable they may yet be found in some of the more calcareous 

 portions. 



Another fact apparently indicating some kind of relation between the gypsum- 

 bearing beds, as well as some of the higher deposits, and the rocks below, 

 is, that we often find both in the clays between the beds of gypsum, and those 

 between the limestone containing the Permian fossils, the same peculiar appear- 

 ance caused by the cracking of the clays and subsequent infiltration of calcare- 

 ous matter, seen in division No. 5. At some places the thin plates of limestone 

 formed by the impure calcareous matter filling these cracks, may be seen rami- 

 fying through some rather thin beds of these clays in all directions, so as to 

 cross and intersect each other at every angle. Where beds of this kind have 

 been exposed for any length of time along near the tops of bluffs, the softer 

 clays filling the interstices, often weather out, so as to have a curious cellular 

 mass, with the numerous angular cavities. 



From these fact3 we are inclined to suspect, though we are fully aware that 

 it is a question which can only be determined upon evidence derived from or- 

 ganic remains, that not only the gypsum-bearing deposits, but a large portion, 

 if not all, of division No. 5, belongs to the same epoch as the beds containing 

 the Permian fossils below. 



Between No. 5, and the Cretaceous above, there is still a rather extensive 

 series of beds in which we found no organic remains ; these may be Jurassic 

 or Triassic, or both, though as we have elsewhere suggested, we rather incline 

 to the opinion that they may prove to belong to the former. As we have fully 

 discussed the question in regard to the Cretaceous age of the highest division 

 of the foregoing section in a paper read before the Academy in December last, 

 and in an article in the American Journal of Science, January, 1859, it is un- 

 necessary for us to add any thing further on that subject here. 



As already stated, our observations along the Kansas valley, to within twelve 

 or fourteen miles of the mouth of the Big Blue river, were too isolated to a deter- 

 mine in all cases the relations between outcrops seen at different places. Con- 

 sequently, although we saw at several points along this part of the valley, in- 

 dications of a westward or north-westward inclination of the strata, we were 

 left in some doubt whether or not there is a general inclination of the rocks in 

 that direction, between Wabounse and the Missouri. Above this point, how- 

 ever, our observations being more connected, and the exposuies more continu- 

 ous, we were able to determine very satisfactorily that there is at least from 

 near Wabounse, a uniform dip towards the west or north-west, so that in as- 

 cending the Kansas valley from this region, we are constantly meeting with 

 more and more modern rocks, as those we leave behind pass beneath the level 

 of Kansas. 



1859.] 




22 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



To illustrate this more clearly, we would, in the first place, remark that a 

 bed of light greyish yellow granular magnesian limestone, mentioned on page 

 12, as occupying a horizon about 115 feet above the Kansas, two or three miles 

 west of Zeandale, passes beneath the level of Kansas before reaching the 

 mouth of the Big Blue river, a distance of near seven miles ; while another 

 bed (No. 26 of the foregoing section) seen on the very summit of the hills two 

 or three miles north of Zeandale, at an elevation of about 320 feet above the 

 Kansas, was observed opposite Manhattan at the mouth of Big Blue river, only 

 some 214 feet above the Kansas. Again, bed No. 12 of the foregoing general 

 section, which was seen at a locality nearly opposite Ogden, at an elevation of 

 about 363 feet above the Kansas, is at Fort Riley, eight or nine miles further 

 west, elevated only some 215 feet above Kansas. Above Fort Riley tbis bed 

 forms a marked horizon, and can be followed by the eye without interruption 

 for several miles along the hills on both sides of the river. We observed it 

 gradually sinking as we ascended the Kansas valley, until at a point on Chap- 

 man's Creek, some fifteen miles a little south of west from Fort Riley, we saw it 

 nearly down on a level with the Kansas ; beyond this it was not again met with 

 on the noith side of the Kansas, but we saw it at somewhat higher elevations 

 on the south side of the river a little west of this. 



As the distance by an air-line, from the locality nearly opposite Ogden, 

 where this rock occupies a horizon at an elevation of 363 feet above the Kansas 

 to the mouth of Chapman's Creek, is about 23 miles, the dip would appear to 

 be not far from 15^ feet to the mile. It must be borne in mind, however, that 

 the average fall of the Kansas, at least below Fort Riley, according to the 

 Barometrical observations of Col. Fremont and others, is near one and a half 

 feet to the mile, and that if we assume the distance by the windings of the 

 river between Chapman's Creek and Ogden, to be about thirty miles, it would 

 make the elevation of the Kansas at the former locality some forty-five feet 

 greater than at Ogden, which would reduce the dip to a fraction less than 14 

 feet to the mile. Still as the direction of the dip in this region is to the north 

 of west, and the direction of the mouth of Chapman's Creek from Ogden is 

 considerably south of west, it is probable the inclination of the strata here is 

 greater than the above figures would indicate, and that it may not be less than 

 twenty feet to the mile, in a north-west direction. 



From the foregoing statements it will be seen that in consequence of the dip 

 of tbe strata to the north-west, and in some slight degree to the fall of the 

 Kansas and Smoky Hill rivers, the whole of the foregoing general section be- 

 low No. 12 passes beneath the level of the Smoky Hill, between the mouth of 

 Blue river and Chapman's Creek. Consequently, the limestones of the succeed- 

 ing beds above being thinner and less durable than those below, and separated 

 by heavy beds of clay; we find, as might be expected, that the country here in 

 the region of the mouth of Chapman's Creek, is much lower than at Fort Riley 

 and. below. 



On reaching the mouth of Solomon's Fork, we found the face of the country 

 characterized by long gentle grassy slopes, no part of it near the river being 

 apparently elevated more than about 60 or TO feet above its surface. A short 

 distance beyond this, we caught the first glimpse of the Smoky Hills, which 

 were seen in a direction a little south of west from us, rising above the sur- 

 rounding low country like dark blue clouds above the horizon. On approach- 

 ing these, we found them always situated several miles back from the river, 

 and rising some tbree hundred and fifty feet above it. The immediate bluffs 

 of the river here, are generally composed of divisions No. 4 and 5 of the fore- 

 going general section, and that portion of these hills above the level of the 

 summits of the bluffs along the river, is made up of division Nos. 3, 2, 1, of the 

 same section. On the south side of the river these hill have but a compara- 

 tively thin capping of the sandstone No. 1, but on the north side we saw it 

 showing a thickening on some of them of sixty feet. 



From some of these hills on the north side of Smoky Hill river, between it 

 and the Grand Saline, we had an extensive and beautiful view of the surround- 



[J 



an. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 23 



ing country. In the north and north-west, many similar hills were in sight, 

 and as the dip of the strata here is in that direction, it is probable some of 

 this are not only chiefly made up of the sandstone No. 1, but surmounted by 

 the other Cretaceous beds Nos. 2 and 3 of the Nebraska Cretaceous series ; in- 

 deed, Dr. Engleman found all these formations occupying this relation on Re- 

 publican river, not more than seventy miles north of this.* 



Although this paper is merely designed to give a brief sketch of the leading 

 geological feature of those portions of north-eastern Kansas visited by us, we 

 cannot close it without alluding to the truly great agricultural and other natural 

 resources of this new and interesting Territory. We mean no disparagement 

 to other portions of the Mississippi valley, when we state, that after having 

 travelled extensively in the Great West, and after having seen many of its 

 most favored spots, we have met with no country combining more attractive 

 features than Kansas Territory. Her geographical position gives her a com- 

 paratively mild and genial climate, intermediate between the extremes of heat 

 and cold, while the rich virgin soil of her beautiful prairies is admirably 

 adapted to the growth of all the great staple grain and root crops of the west. 



It is true that in some districts there is rather a deficiency of timber, but as 

 a general thing there is along the streams sufficient for the immediate wants of 

 the country. In addition to this, the wonderful rapidity with which forests 

 are known to have sprung up on similar prairie lands in Missouri, as the 

 country became settled so as to keep out the annual fires, shows that the 

 present scarcity of timber should not be regarded as presenting any serious 

 obstacle to the settlement of the most extensive prairie district in Kansas. 



Before going out into the interior of the Territory, we had expected to find 

 the whole country immediately west of Fort Riley comparatively sterile ; on 

 the contrary, however, we were agreeably disappointed at meeting with scarcely 

 any indications of decreasing fertility as far as our travels extended, which 

 was about sixty miles west of Fort Riley. Here we found the prairies clothed 

 with a luxuriant growth of grass, and literally alive with vast herds of Buffalo 

 that were seen quietly grazing as far as the eye could reach in every direction. 

 Even on the high divide between the Smoky Hill and Arkansas rivers, south of 

 this, we found the soil rich and supporting a dense growth of grass ; and from all 

 we could learn from persons who have gone further out, the same kind of 

 country extends for a long distance beyond this, towards the west. Hence we 

 infer that the belt of unproductive lands between the rich country on the east, 

 and the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains on the west, is much narrower than 

 is generally supposed ; and even this so-called desert country is known to pos- 

 sess a good soil, which may be rendered fruitful by artificial irrigation. 



In regard to the mineral resources of Kansas, we have at present only time 

 and space to say a few words. As already stated, coal is known to exist, 

 though its extent is not yet fully determined, at several localities in the region 

 of Leavenworth City, while the geological structure of the country, as well as 

 discoveries already made, warrant the conclusion that this important and useful 

 mineral abounds at many localities south of there. Limestone suitable for 

 building purposes, and the production of quicklime, exist throughout large areas, 

 while inexhaustible beds of gypsum are known to occur at several places not 

 far west of the mouth of Solomon's river. Near this place we likewise saw in 

 the lower Cretaceous rocks crowning the summits of the Smoky Hills, deposits 

 of iron ore, but were unable to determine in the limited time at our command, 

 whether or not it exists in large quantities. 



Of the discoveries of gold in the mountains on the western borders of Kan- 

 sas, much has been said ; nothing, however, but a thorough geological survey, 

 by authority of the Territorial or State government, (for Kansas must soon be 

 a State,) can lay before the public such full, accurate, and reliable information 

 on these subjects as will bring from the older States the capital, skill and 

 enterprise necessary to develop the great natural resources of the country.

Note. It affords us much pleasure to acknowledge here our obligations to 

 Prof. Henry, of the Smithsonian Institution, for free access to the extensive 

 series of books on Geology, Palaeontology, &c, in the Smithsonian Library, 

 while investigating these and our former collections from the west : also for 

 the use of rooms in the Institution, and for many other favors of great value 

 to us. 



We are likewise under especial obligations to Capt. Stewart Vanvliet, and 

 Mr. Levi Wilson of Fort Leavenworth, for favors while out in Kansas, without 

 which we could have accomplished nothing : we also received many civilities 

 from Major Sedgwick, Dr. T. G. Madison, Capt. W. S. Walker, and other officers 

 of the army at Fort Riley. 



List of the species mentioned in this paper with some remarks on the synonymy, and 

 references to the works, in which they are described. 



FORAMINIPERA. 



Fusulina cylindrica, Fischer, Oryct. Moscow, p. 126, p. 18, fag. 1 5. 



In Russia this species is said to occur only in the upper part of lower carbo- 

 niferous or mountain limestone. Yet the species usually referred to F. cylin- 

 drica in this country, so far as our knowledge extends, is not found below the 

 coal measures. From this fact, and some slight differences we observe between 

 our specimens and the figures of the Russian species, we suspect a careful 

 comparison of good specimens may possibly prove them to be distinct. 

 Ranges in Kansas from division No. 22, of the foregoing section, far down into 

 the coal measures. Found at numerous localities between Manhattan and the 

 Missouri, usually in great numbers. 



Fusulina cylindrica, Tar. ventricosa, Meek and Hayden, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. 

 Phila. Dec. 1858, page 261. Division No. 37, of foregoing general sectional 

 Manhattan on the Kansas, and at Juniata on big Blue river. 



Bryozoa. 

 Synocladia biserialis. Prof. Swallow refers this species with doubt to S. virgu- 

 lacea, Philips, sp. in Transactions Acad. Sci. St. Louis, vol. 1, p. 179, and points 

 out some of the characters in which it differs, stating at the same time, in case 

 it should prove to be distinct, that biserialis would be a good specific name for 

 it. We regard it as quite distinct from Phillips' species, not only in scarcely 

 ever having more than two rows of cellules, but also because the ?gemuliferous 

 vesicles, instead of being merely " tubercular and open at the summit," have 

 the form of short, but distinct spines apparently closed and rather obtusely 

 pointed at the apex. The branches or connecting process are likewise less 

 distinctly angulated between the longitudinal stems, than in S. viryulacea. 

 Occurs at Fort Riley in No. 19 of foregoing general section, and at various lower 

 horizons on the Kansas below there, down into the upper coal measures. 



Acanthocladia Americana. In the Trans. Acad. Sci. St. Louis, vol. 1, p. 180, 

 Prof. Swallow refers this species with a query to A. anceps, Schlot. sp. and re- 

 marks that it differs from that species in having "the rows of cellules diagonal 

 to the axis of the stems, instead of longitudinal, as represented by King, and 

 on ridges like that figured by Goldfuss.'' He also further remarks that " it is 

 less regularly branched, and not so distinctly pinnated as those delineated by 

 Goldfuss and King." In the specimens in our collection, the cellules are more 

 numerous, and much more crowded, than in A. anceps as figured by King The 

 specific name Americana, was suggested by Prof. Swallow. 



We found this species in Division No. 18, of the foregoing general section, on 

 Cottonwood Creek. 



ECHINODERMATA. 



Cyathocrinus ? A few scapular plates bearing some similarity to those of C. 

 ramosus, Schlot. sp. were met with by us in division No. 18, but they are pro- 

 portionably much thicker, and the articulating surfaces quite different. 

 Cottonwood Creek. 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 25 



Archceocidaris ? In No. 12, we found spines and detached plates of apparent- 

 ly an undescribed species of this genus, but they were too much weathered to 

 show clearly the specific characters. The spines are rather slender, terete, 

 nearly straight, and provided with short scattering spinous processes, directed 

 rather obliquely outwards and forward. 

 Cottonwood Creek. 



Archceocidaris ? The spines of this species are much larger than the last, 



and apparently destitute of spinous processes. They are as much as from three 

 to four inches in length, nearly or quite straight, and not flattened or com- 

 pressed. 



Division No. 26, Manhattan and in same position on Cottonwood Creek. 



Brachiopoda. 



Discina tenuilineata n. sp. We have only seen the lower valve of this species, 

 which is extremely thin, nearly orbicular, and provided with a narrow perforation 

 extending from very near the centre about half way out to the margin. The 

 inner surface is ornamented by distant, extremely slender, distinctly elevated 

 lines of growth, arranged concentrically around a point very nearly in the mid- 

 dle of the valve. The apex of the upper valve was probably nearly central. 

 Diameter 0-50 inch. 



Locality and position. Cottonwood Creek, division No. 16. 



Discina Manhattanensisn. sp. Shell rather small, nearly circular ; upper valve 

 moderately elevated, apex rather obtusely pointed, located a little less than half 

 the diameter of the shell from the posterior edge. Surface black and shining, 

 marked by fine closely set concentric lines. Lower valve unknown. Greater 

 diameter from 0-32 in. to 0-46. 



Found in great numbers in division No. 37, opposite Manhattan, on Kansas 

 river. 



Productus splendens (.?), Norwood and Pratten, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. 

 N. S. vol. 3, pi. fig. 5. We refer this shell to the above species with some doubt ; 

 it is always smaller than the figure given by Norwood and Pratten, and rather 

 more convex over the visceral region of the larger valve, while the smaller valve 

 appears to want the band-like flattening around the border mentioned in the 

 description of P. splendens. The ears extend beyond the body of the shell, 

 are distinctly vaulted, and rarely have more than one spine on each, often none. 

 The spines, however, are more numerous over the surface of the larger valve, 

 being in this respect more like P. muricatus'8. and P., but both valves want the 

 concentric wrinkles represented in the figures of that species. 



This neat little Productus is found in great numbers between Fort Riley and 

 Manhattan, as well as at the latter place, in Division No. 34 ; also at various 

 horizons below that in the upper coal measures of Kansas. 



Productus Norivoodi, Swallow, Trans. Acad. Sci. St, Louis, vol. 1, p. 182. A 

 few specimens of this species in our possession have the extreme point of the 

 beak of the larger valve flattened or truncate, aa though it had in the young 

 state been attached to some marine body by that part of the shell. We have 

 also in several instances found other shells associated with this species, with 

 small discs not more than 0-20 inch in diameter, attached by the whole surface, 

 as well as by a series of small spines seen radiating from the margin. May not 

 these little bodies be the young of this species? 



We think the specimen figured by Prof. Marcou in his work on the Geology 

 of North America, plate 6, fig. 1, as P. pustidosus, is the same as the above spe- 

 cies, and quite distinct from P. pustidosus. It occurs in Kansas at various ho- 

 rizons from No. 14 far down in the upper Coal measures. We found it at Fort 

 Riley and numerous places between there and the Missouri, as well as at Leav- 

 enworth city.

Productus Rogersi, Norwood and Pratten, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phil. N. S. 

 vol. ill, page 9, pi. 1, fig. 3. This species is nearly related to the last, and 

 when the shell is exfoliated, may be easily confounded with it. P. Nor- 

 woodi, however, appears never to have the distinct concentric wrinkles of this 

 species, nor do the pustules, at the base of the spines have the tendency to elon- 

 gate into indistinct ribs as in P. Rogersi. Prof. Marcou has figured in N. Am. 

 Geol. pi. 5, fig. 6, as Productus scabriculus, a shell very like this. 



Kansas valley below Mouth Blue river, in upper Coal measures. 



Productus pustulosus (?) Phillips' Geol. Yorkshire, vol. 2, p. 316, pi. 7, fig 15. 

 We have a specimen agreeing very nearly with this species in its external 

 markings, but it is much narrower, and the beak of the larger valve more ex- 

 tended, in which respect it differs quite as much from P. punctatus. 



Near Steam Boat Landing at Leavenworth city, in Coal measures.

Productus Calhounianus, Swallow, Trans. Acad. Sci. St. Louis, vol. 1, p. 181. 

 This fine large shell is scarcely distinguishable from P. semireticulatus var. anti- 

 qvus. but Prof. Swallow, who has seen the interior, thinks it presents well 

 marked internal differences. It occurs in No. 12 and below, at Fort Riley, also 

 on Cotton-wood creek. Prof. S. thinks it even ranges down into the lower Car- 

 boniferous. 



Chonetes Verneuiliana, Norwood and Pratten, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. vol.

Orthisina crassa, Meek and Hayden, Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. Dec. 1858, 

 p. 261. Occurs in Coal measures near landing at Leavenworth city. 



Orthisina umbraculum? Schlot. sp. Petrefakt. 1, p. 256, et 2, p. 67. We find 

 in Kansas, ranging from 16 to 19 of foregoing sections, many specimens of a 

 large species of Orthisina having almost exactly the form and other characters 

 of 0. umbraculum, excepting that the striae appear to be more numerous. Ac- 

 cording to Koninck that species has about 108 striae on each valve, while on our 

 Kansas specimens, we count from 160 to 200 ; consequently we suspect it may 

 be a distinct but closely allied species; if so, we would propose to designate it 

 by the name of O. multistriata. We found it at Fort Riley and at several lo- 

 calities between there and Blue river; also in same position on Cottonwood 

 creek. 



Orthisina Missouriensis, Swallow, Tra ns. Acad. Sci. St. Louis, vol. 1, p. 219. 

 This is a very peculiar plicated species, often much distorted. When partly 

 embedded in the matrix, it frequently bears a striking resemblance to Plicatula 

 striato-costata, Cox, 3d vol. Dr. Owen ; s report on the Geol. Survey of Kentucky, 

 page 558, pi. 8, fig. 7, of Atlas. Common in the upper Coal measures of Kan- 

 sas, at Leavenworth city and west of there. 



Orthisina Shumardiana, Swallow, Trans, St. Louis Acad. Sci. vol. 1, p. 183- 

 Although like the last, a plicated species, this is more symmetrical, and 

 presents other well marked differences. Ranges from No. 11, down some dis- 

 tance in upper Coal measures. Found at Fort Riley and between there and

sas specimens appear, however, to be more elongated than those figures by Dr. 

 Morton, and may be distinct. In form they resemble very much some varieties 

 of Epithyris elongata, Schlot. sp. as figured by King, in Perm. Fos. Eng. pi. vi., 

 particularly the narrower varieties, such as fig. 35. The beak of our Kansas 

 shell, however, is not truncate but pointed, the perforation being on the outside, 

 and a little removed from the extremity. If it is identical with T. bovidcns, 

 Morton's specific name will have to take precedence, being the older. It re- 

 mains to be determined whether its internal characters agree with Terebratula, 

 as now restricted. 



Thi3 is a rather common form in the upper Coal measures of Kansas, and 

 southward. We found it near the summit of the hills back of Leavenworth city, 

 also at Indian creek near Indianola, &c. 



Rhynchonella Uta. {Terebratula Ufa, Marcou, Geol. N. A., p. 51, pi. vi.'fig 12.) 

 We have from the upper Coal measures in Kansas many specimens of a species 

 agreeing exactly with Prof. Marcou's description of the above species. These 

 we suspect may possibly go into the genus Carrier ophoria, King, if not into Rhyn- 

 chonella] at any rate they are certainly not Terebratula. We are inclined to the 

 opinion that ashell described by Prof. Swallow, in the Trans. Acad- Sci. St. 

 Louis, vol. 1, page 219, under the name of Rhynchonella (Camerophoria) Osagen- 

 $is, may be identical also with the above ; yet Prof. S. says his species has from 

 " two to six " plications in the sinus of the dorsal valve, while in the shell 

 before us, of which we have quite a number of specimens, there are invariably 

 but two plications in the sinus. 



Quite common in division No. 94 at Manhattan and at several localities be- 

 tween there and the Missouri, in the Upper Coal Measures. Prof. Marcou, cites 

 it as a mountain limestone species, but we know nothing of its existence in 

 rocks of that age. 



Retzia Mormonii. 'Terebratula Mormonii, Marcou, Geol. N. A., p. 51,pl.vi., f. 11.) 

 We found this species quite abundant in division 37, at Manhattan, where it is 

 associated with the last. It also ranges far below this in the upper Coal meas- 

 ures between Manhattan and the Missouri, being quite common near the sum- 

 mits of the hills back of Leavenworth city. Dr. B. F. Shumard has described 

 a species in the Trans. Acad. Sci. St. Louis, under the name of Retzia punctilife- 

 ra, which we suspect may possibly be a variety of the above; but as he de- 

 scribes it as having usually in the dorsal valve " a moderately wide, shallow si- 

 nus, which extends from the front nearly to the beak," and the species before 

 us, of which we have many specimens, has no traces of a sinus, we are left in 

 doubt. In other respects his description agrees exactly with our shell, and he 

 also states that he has it from K. T. Prof. Marcou found this species at the 

 Salt Like City, Utah, in a rock he refers to the mountain limestone. We have 

 never seen it from below the Coal measures. 



Spirifer Kentuckensis, Shumard, Geol. Survey of Missouri, part 2, page 203. 

 Found in upper Coal Measures near the top of bluffs, back of Fort Leavenworth, 

 also near the landing at Leavenworth City, and at other localities between the 

 Missouri and Blue river. 



Spirifer cameratus, Morton, American Jour. Sci. vol. 29, p. 150, plate 11, fig 3. 

 This is the same species as has been determined by Prof. Hall, described by 

 Dr. Roemer as S. Meusebachanus. (Kreid von Texas, p. 88, pi. xi. fig. 7) and sub- 

 sequently by himself as S. triplicatus, in Stansburv's Rept. p. 420, pi. iv. fig. 5. 

 Prof. Marcou has recently figured it in his work on the Geol. North America, 

 page 49, pi. viii. fig. 3, as a variety of Spirifer striatus, Martin, from which it is 

 quite distinct. He found it at Pecos Village in a rock he refers to the lower 

 Carboniferous or mountain limestone. It has a great geographical range, be- 

 ing common in the coal Measures from Pennsylvania to the Rocky Mountains, 

 and from Nebraska to New Mexico; we have never seen it, however, from lower 

 Carboniferous rocks.

 Leavenworth landing, in the coal measures, a Spirifer, apparently identical with 

 the above. It appears not to range very high in the upper coal measures of 

 Kansas. 



Spirifer . In division No. 12, above Fort Riley, we found a few imperfect 



specimens of a small, smooth Spirifer, similar in some respects, to S. lineatus, 

 but apparently more like Martinia Clannyana, King, from the Permian of Eng- 

 land. 



Spirifer planoconvexa, Shumard. Geol. Report, Missouri, 2d part, p. 202. 

 We found this handsome little shell quite abundant in the upper coal measures 

 (divisions 34 and 37,) at Manhattan ; also at Juniata, on Big Blue River, and near 

 summit of hills, back of Leavenworth City. 



Spirigera subtilita. (Terebratula subtilita, Hall. Stansbury's Report, p. 409, 

 pi. 4. fig. 1-2.) Spirigera subtilita of Dr. George Shumard. Trans. St. Louis 

 Acad. Sci., vol. i. 



This is a very abundant species in Kansas ; we found it ranging up, at least as 

 far as division No. 37, at Manhattan, and met with some obscure forms re- 

 sembling it, still higher in the series. From these horizons, it, ranges far down 

 in the other members of the coal measures. Several of our specimens col- 

 lected at Leavenworth City, show that it was provided with internal spiral ap- 

 pendages, as in the Spirifer, and consequently cannot remain in the genus Te- 

 rebratula, as now restricted. It has a wide geographical range, and is almost 

 everywhere the companion of Spirifer earner atus. Prof. Marcou figures it in 

 his work on the Geology of North America, pi. vi. fig. 9, from a formation in 

 the Rocky Mountains, which he refers to, the lower carboniferous ; but we have 

 never seen it from any position below the coal measures. 



Spirigera ? At Fort Riley, and above there, as well as in the same position on 



Cottonwood Creek, we found, ranging from division 18 up to 10 of the fore- 

 going section, a Spirigera resembling S. subtilita, but much more gibbous in 

 form ; it also appears to have a much thicker shell. If distinct from S. subtilita 

 this might be designated by the specific name gibbosa. 



Lamellibranchiata. 

 Monotis Hawni, Meek and Hayden. Trans. Albany Inst., vol. iv., March 2, 

 1858. Prof. Swallow thinks this species not distinct from M. speluncaria, Schot 

 sp. Although, like that species, it is quite variable, and some of its varieties 

 are very similar to it; after a careful comparison of a large number of indi- 

 viduals with King's figures and descriptions, we still regard it as distinct. We 

 have never seen any of its various forms with the beak of the larger valve ele- 

 vated so far above the hinge, as in fig. 5, 6, 7 and 8, pi. 13, of King's work. 

 Nor do any of our specimens possess the peculiar oblique posterior sulcus, seen 

 in the figures cited above. High Country, south of Kansas Falls ; also above 

 there, on Smoky Hill River and Cottonwood Creek, in division 10. 



Myalina [Mytilus) peraltenuata, Meek and Hayden. Trans. Albany Inst., vol. 

 iv., March 2d, 1858. Our description of this species was made out from one 

 of the more slender varieties of this shell, sent to us from near Smoky Hill 

 River by Mr. Hawn. We were probably wrong, however, in refering to it a 

 specimen in our possession from a locality on the Missouri, opposite the north- 

 ern boundary of Missouri; and we even suspect the rock from which this latter 

 specimen was obtained may belong to an older epoch. 



The species above cited, is we think identical with M. permianus of Swallow, 

 Trans. Acad. Sci., St. Louis, vol. i. p. 187. And we also suspect the form he de- 

 scribes in the same paper, as Mytilus {Myalina) concavus, is only a broader va-

Of the form, we refer with doubt to the above species; we have but one im- 

 perfect specimen. As far as the characters can be made out, it agrees with this 

 species. We found it iu division No 11, at Kansas Falls, above Fort Riley.

 suspect it may be a Cardinia. NearSmoky Hill river, in division 10. 



Bakevellia parva, Meek and Hayden. Trans. Albauy Inst., vol. iv., March 2d,

 antiqua, Minister, Bakevellia antiqua of King, and others. In describing this spe- 

 cies, we spoke of its very near relation to B. antiqua, but pointed out some 

 characters in which it differs. At that time we had seen but a few imperfect 

 specimens; since then, however, we have obtained many others, a careful ex- 

 amination of which causes us still to regard it as distinct from B. antiqua. 

 Of a large number of individuals, we have never seen any one-half the size 

 of the smallest, nor one-eighth the size of the largest figures of that species 

 given by King, while the cardinal area is also proportionably much narrower iu

Catalogue of Birds collected on the Rivers Camma and Ogobai, Western Africa, 

 by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu in 1858, with notes and descriptions of new species. 



BY JOHN CASSIN. 



The collection made by Mr. Duchaillu on the River Camma or Fernando Vaz 

 and its tributaries, the Ogobai, Rembo, and Ovenga rivers, is the most exten- 

 sive and interesting yet made by him, or ever yet received from Western Africa, 

 in the Museum of this Academy. The two last names of rivers I have not used 

 in the localities given in the succeeding catalogue, mainly because I have not 

 succeeded in finding them in any geographical work to which I have access, 

 but now state that these names occur in Mr. Duchaillu's letters, and that they 

 appear to be tributaries to the River Camma. Much valuable information will 

 undoubtedly be added to the geography of this part of Western Africa by Mr. 

 Duchaillu. 



As in former collections, Mr. Duchaillu has not sent birds of which numerous 

 specimens had already been sent in former collections. This fact will account 

 for the absence of the names of some well known species from the present cata- 

 logue.

Adults in fine plumage, from the Camma, the same species as formerly, re-

 South African specimens. The species from Madagascar, which is Polyboroidet 

 radiatus, (Scopoli,) and the same as Falco gymnogenys, Temm., is smaller and 

 lighter colored, and has the transverse stripes on the abdomen much less nu- 

 merous and wider apart than in the present bird.

The present specimen is in very light colored plumage, undoubtedly young, and 

 much as described and figured by Cuvier and Temminck, as above cited. It is, 

 however, quite identical with the bacha of Southern Africa, of which a very 

 complete series of specimens is in the Academy's Museum. The young is 

 nearly white, though even when fully grown and in a more advanced plumage 

 has the head white, and a large spot of black in the region of the eye and ear. 

 In the last plumage I suspect this bird is the species recently described by our 

 friend, Mr. Verreaux, of Paris, as cited above. 



Young % . Upper part3 white, tinged with yellow, every feather with a sub- 

 terminal spot of dark brown ; lanceolate and ovate on the head and neck ; 

 larger and more circular on the back ; every feather narrowly tipped with 

 white. Under paits white, with a few spear-heads of brownish black on the 

 breast and sides. Quills and superior wing coverts dark brown ; all the quills 

 and every feather of the coverts tipped with white ; tail ashy brown, with about 

 six transverse bands of black, and tipped with white. Total length 23 inches r 

 wing 12 ; tail 10 inches.

 mature plumage, but is probably a different sex from that described as above, 

 and has the entire under parts of the body dark rufous chestnut. In the de- 

 scription by Dr. Hartlaub, the under parts are given as white, but the differ- 

 ence of the two specimens in color is not greater than, and in fact is similar 

 in some degree to, that of the male and female of Micrastur brachypterus. 



Adult ^ . Upper parts dark bluish brown ; upper tail coverts white ; under 

 parts dark reddish chestnut ; under wing coverts chestnut ; under tail coverts 

 white. Quills ashy brown, white beneath and with transverse bands of black ; 

 tail black, tipped with white and with about four irregular narrow bands of 

 white. Throat light cinereous ; feathers of the occiput and neck behind white at 

 base. Bill short, strong, rather abruptly curved, cere large; nostrils circular;

 as C. binotatus in my catalogue of birds from the river Muni. In adult plu- 

 mage this species is easily recognized by the white tips of the larger external 

 coverts of the wings, and in nearly all the specimens that I have seen this 

 character can be traced. 



Specimens from Borneo and Sumatra in the Acad. Mus. which were received 

 from the Leyden Museum, appear to be the C. binotatus of Bonaparte's Con- 

 spectus, (i. p. 60) but came labelled " C. bisignatus Boie," and seem to be the 

 same as C. affinis, Horsfield. It is probable that the present species is C.

 its black head, which color terminates abruptly on the breast and is succeeded 

 by a band of dark chestnut. It is nearly as large as Nyctiornis amictus or 

 Athertoni.

 peculiar color given as "fuliginous" by authors, assumes a variety of shades 

 in this species, apparently depending on age and season. It is frequently very

Nectarinia tephrolaema, Jard., Contr. Orn., 1851, p. 154. 



From the Ogobai and Moonda rivers. The description of the female given 

 by Dr. Hartlaub applies to young males in the present collection, but unfor- 

 tunately I am not fully assured of the correctness of the supposed females of 

 this species in this collection, and do not therefore describe with con- 

 fidence. The specimens alluded to are entirely dark ashy, (about the color of 

 the throat in the male,) darker above and lighter on the under parts. 



This appears to be a rare species in Equatorial Africa, and is remarkable in 

 having' the throat pale cinereous, though surrounded with a large space of 

 brilliant metallic green. It is probably the type of a subgenus and does not 

 belong to the same group as the preceding (iV. cyanolaema,) though given so, 

 erroneously, by Dr. Reichenbach in his genus Anthodiceta. This author is, 

 however, not acquainted with the genera of birds.

 taining a suspicion that all are identical. These specimens are perhaps not 

 correctly labelled, but at present my leisure does not warrant an extended ex-

An obscure species, of which two specimens only are in the collection from 

 Mr. Duchaillu, one in the present collection and another formerly from the 

 Moonda. In the Acad. Mus. are several specimens from the Rivoli collection, 

 all of which are labelled ' ' Cinnyris cyanocephala, $ . " It may be that species 

 jn immature plumage, or in the plumage of the rainy season.*

Several specimens of this species are in the present collection from the Camma 

 and Ogobai. The adult is well represented and described in the work cited 

 above, though in the figure the tail is quite erroneous. The middle feathers 

 of the latter are greenish yellow, which is also the color of the outer webs, and 

 a large portion of the inner webs of all the other feathers of the tail. 5 

 Smaller than the male but very similar in colors. Young 5 Like the female, 

 but with the colors duller and of darker green in all the plumage, no axillary 

 tufts.

 type of his description is now in the Museum of this Academy. The female 

 is so entirely different that it might readily be regarded as a distinct species. 

 Adult 2 Upper parts lustrous metallic dark green, purple on the rump 

 and tail, throat and breast pale ashy, abdomen pale yellow. A stripe of white 

 through and behind the eye. Young 5 . Upper parts dull yellowish green, 

 under parts pale yellow, tinged with very pale asby on the throat, very dis- 

 tinct stripe of pale yellowish white through the eye, tail metallic green, outer 

 feathers tipped with dull white. From the Camma and Ogobai.

Drymoica naevia, Hartl. Orn. W. Afr. p. 56. 

 A single specimen from the Camma and another in a former collection from

 to the succeeding.

 From the Camma and formerly received from Cape Lopez. In a young bird 

 the bill is pale yellow, except the tip of the upper mandible. The birds re- 

 garded by me as the present species and the preceding (D. ncevid) are both 

 nearly related to D. robusta, Riippell, Syst. Ueb. pi. 13.

 genus in Equatorial Western Africa. 



*Two other species complete the Nectarinice, found by Mr. Duchaillu :

Genus Euprinodes, nobis. 

 Size small, bill rather long, slightly curved, nostril large, wings short, first 

 quill spurious, fourth and fifth longest and nearly equal, tail rather long, gra- 

 duated, legs moderate, slender. More nearly related to Prinia, (P. familiaris) 

 than to either of the preceding species of Drymoica.

Drymoica rufogularis, Frazer, Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1843, p. 17. 



Fraser, Zool. Typ. pi. 42, fig. 1. 



A very pretty and well marked little bird now for the first time received 

 from the Camma. Mr. Fraser's figure seems to represent a bird not mature, 

 but the species is easily recognized by its rufous throat and white tail 

 feathers. 



54. Euprinodes olivaceus, (Strickland.) 



Prinia olivacea, Strickl. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1844, p. 99. 

 The species to which I apply this name is labelled by Mr. Duchaillu as dis- 

 tinct, but no one of several specimens is mature, though agreeing precisely 

 with the description cited above. I am not without a suspicion that this bird 

 is the young of the preceding. From the Camma. 



55. Euprinodes schistaceus, nobis. 



Strictly congeneric with the two preceding. Head, breast and entire upper parts 

 bluish cinereous, with a slight tinge of olive on the back; abdomen, under wing 

 coverts and under tail coverts, white. Quills brownish black, four middle tail 

 feathers brownish black, with obscure tranverse narrow stripes of a darker 

 shade of the same color, four external tail feathers on each side, pure white, 

 bill black, legs light colored. Total length about 4^ inches, wing If, tail 2 

 inches. 



Hab. River Camma, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



The preceding three species are very similar in their general organization, 

 and form a very natural group. All have the outer tail feathers white. The 

 present species is easily recognized by the entire head and upper breast being 

 bluish ashy, which color is abruptly succeeded by white on the lower part of 

 the breast. One specimen only, labelled as an adult male, is in the collection 

 from the Camma. 



56. Camaroptera tincta, (Cassin.) 



Syncopta tincta, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada. vii. p. 325, (1855.) 

 The adult is described by me as above. In the present collection are speci- 

 mens that we regard as the young, and so different from the adult that for the 

 first time we perceive this to be rather a difficult species. Young. Upper 

 parts yellowish olive green, under parts cinereous, mixed with yellow on the 

 breast and sides, tibise greenish ochre yellow, under wing coverts and edge of 

 wing at shoulder, dull yellow. Younger. Entire plumage yellowish olive 

 green, paler on the under parts and nearly white on the abdomen, tibiae brown- 

 ish ochre yellow, edge of wing and under coverts yellow. The last plumage 

 much resembles that of C. concolor, Hartlaub.

 Dr. Hartlaub. (Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 1858, p. 470). A single specimen 

 from the Camma.

 with olive, tail dark olive, with an obscure subterminal band of brownish 

 black, and outer feathers narrowly tipped with white. Under wing coverts, 

 under tail coverts and tibice ashy white. Bill bluish black, legs light colored. 

 Total length about 4J inches, wing 2, tail If inches. 



Hah. Camnia River, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



This handsome and rather singular species may be easily recognized by its 

 yellow breast, which color assumes the form of a wide transverse band and 

 contrasts strongly with the white color of the throat and abdomen. One speci- 

 men only which is a male adult is in the collection from the Gamma. 



59. Camakoptera badiceps, (Fraser.) 



Sylvia badiceps, Fraser, Proc. Zool. Soc, London, 1842, p. 144. 

 The form and general characters of this bird are more those of the genus 

 Camaroptera than of Drymoica, but it is very probably the type of a distinct 

 generic or subgeneric group. It is a strongly marked species. From the Cam- 

 ma and formerly from the Moonda and Cape Lopez.

tify niy former conclusion that the species is identical with Riippell's Troglodyte 

 micrurus, Neue Wirb. Abyss, pi. 41, fig. 2. The upper parts of the body are 

 constantly clear yellowish olive, with the head above dark brown, throat and 

 breast only rufous, abdomen white with a yellow tinge in the middle. It is 

 clearly not the bird figured in Lefebvre's Abyssinia Ois., pi. 6, which is in the 

 Acad. Coll. labelled "Senegal." The present bird has the bill shorter and less 

 curved, and the wings and even the tail shorter than in either of the species 

 of Sylvietta now before me. It may, indeed, indicate a distinct generic or sub- 

 generic group. 



Genus Htlia, nobis.

 This bird is by no manner of means a Stiphrornis, if S. eryththrothorax is the 

 type, which appears to be the case, nor is it a Chloropeta of which C. natalensis, 

 Smith, is the type, nor moreover do we know any other genus to which it be- 

 longs, and so set up for ourselves as best we may. Numerous specimens from 

 the Camma and the Moonda.

Sylvia (Ficedula) umbrovirens, Riipp. Neue. Wirb., p. 112?

Several specimens now received from the Camma are scarcely different from 

 the bird of Europe or that of Asia. Specimens from the Cape of Good Hope 

 and from Northern Africa, strictly the same as the present specimens so far 

 as I can see, are in the Acad. Coll. They rather more closely resemble 

 Asiatic specimens, but are scarcely different specifically from those of South- 

 ern Europe. 



Genus Parmoptila, nobis. 



Allied to Pardalotus. Size small, bill thick, rather wide at base, depressed, 

 curved. Wing moderate, first quill spurious, second and third longest, 

 tail moderate, legs rather strong, toes moderate, claws strong. Feathers of 

 the head and throat in the present species, scale-like. 



66. Parmoptila Woodhousei, nobis. 



5 . Head and throat covered with rounded scale-like feathers, which are 

 rufous, lighter on the throat, brighter and nearly brick-red on the forehead. 

 Back, wings and tail light umber brown with a slight tinge of greenish on 

 the back, quills brownish black edged internally with reddish white. En- 

 tire under parts (except the throat) white, thickly spotted with brownish 

 black. Bill bluish black, legs yellowish white (in skin.)

flah. River Camma, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



This is the only bird from Western Africa that I have ever seen which be- 

 longs to the Pardalotinee. It is easily distinguished specifically by its rufous 

 head and throat and spotted under parts, and is a very curious and hand- 

 some little bird. 



This bird is named in honor of my friend Samuel W. Woodhouse, M. D., 

 of this city, an accomplished and promising young naturalist and scientific 

 traveller in the western countries of the United States.

 Numerous specimens, impossible to determine conclusively from the short 

 and imperfect descriptions. From the Camma and formerly received in every 

 collection from Mr. Duchaillu. 



Genus Macrosphenps, nobis. 



General aspect of Orthotomus (0. sericeus, Temm.) and Ramphocanus {R. 

 mdanurus, Vieill,) but with the bill stronger, wider laterally and more com- 

 pressed, and with the legs and feet stronger. Bill long, rather strong, straight, 

 wide at base, compressed towards the end, upper mandible carinated, curved 

 and distinctly notched at the tip, nostril in a large membrane, under mandible 

 rather thick, somewhat curved in its outline, ascending towards its tip. Wing 

 moderate, first quill spurious, fourth, fifth and sixth longest and nearly equal, 

 tail moderate or rather short, legs moderate, claws rather strong, curved. 



This genus, which I propose for the species immediately succeeding, is ex- 

 actly that of a bird in the Rivoli collection now in the Museum of this Academy, 

 labelled " Ramphocene vert, Ramphocenus viridis, Madagascar." The hand- 

 writing of this label I am not acquainted with, but the same specimen bears 

 another label of locality only : "Madagascar," which I suppose to be in the 

 handwriting of Mons. Victor Massena, and having his initials appended. This 

 bird may be Ramphoceenus viridis, Lesson, Traite d'Orn, p. 377, but which is 

 stated by M. Lesson to be a species of Brazil.* 



* Macrosphenus viridis, (Lesson ?) 



Ramphocaenus viridis. Lesson, Traite d'Orn. i. p. 377, (1831) ? 



Larger than the species above described. Bill long, strong, straight, a few 

 pairs of slender bristles at the base of the upper mandible, wings and tail pro- 

 portionately rather longer than in the above species. Entire upper parts 

 olive green, darker on the head and tinged with yellow on the back. Throat, 

 breast and middle of the abdomen yellow, sides, flanks, tibiae and under tail 

 coverts yellowish green, nearly the color of the back. Under wing coverts 

 yellow, quills brownish black, secondaries edged internally with light reddish, 

 tail dark olive green. An obscure stripe of yellowish in front of the eye. Bill 

 light brown or horn color, legs light colored. Total length about 7 inches, 

 wing 2\, tail 3, bill, from gape, \\, tarsus 1 inch.

Bill long, straight, curved at the tip, and with a distinct notch. Head above 

 dark greenish cinereous, throat and neck in front light cinereous. Body above 

 light olive greeu, below greenish yellow inclining to saffron yellow on the 

 flanks, tibia yellow, mixed with cinereous in its lower third. Under wing 

 coverts silky white, quills brownish black, edged externally with ashy olive, 

 tail olive green, darker on the inner webs. Bill bluish horn color, under man-

Hub. Camma River, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



The affinities of this bird, and that alluded to above, as probably from 

 Madagascar, I have not satisfactorily determined. The general aspect is that 

 of Orthotonus and Ramphoccenus, as stated above, but they appear also to be 

 related to Tatare, Lesson, and in fact have the bills very similar to that of 

 Tatar e lusdnius or Thryothorus luscinius, Quoy et Gaiin. Voy. Astrolabe, Ois. 

 pi. 5. At present my opinion is that they belong to the group Troglodytince. 



Several specimens of this bird are in the collection from the Camma, all of 

 which are labelled as males. 



71. Turdus pelios, Bonaparte. 



Turdus pelios, Bonap. Consp. Av. i. p. 273, (1850.) 

 Though with numerous specimens before me, of both sexes and various ages, 

 I rely on labelled specimens in the Acad. Mus. more than descriptions in the 

 determining of this species. The specimens alluded to are labelled in the 

 handwriting of that very competent naturalist, Mr. Jules Verreaux, and are 

 quite identical with those in the present collection. This species is nearly 

 related to T. libonyanus, Smith, of Southern Africa, and appears to be abundant 

 on the Camma, Moonda and Muni rivers.

 The only specimens that I have ever seen from Equatorial Africa are in the 

 collection from the Camma, and are darker in the color of the upper parts of 

 the body than specimens from Senegal in the Acad. coll. In fact I would de- 

 scribe the back and wing coverts in these specimens as black in the adult and 

 brownish black in the young, though, in other respects, specimens from the 

 localities mentioned are very similar. *

About the size and general form of Turdus interpres, Temm. PI. Col. 458, 

 but does not resemble that species in colors. Tail short, wings moderate, 

 first quill spurious, fourth and fifth longest, legs rather strong, toes rather 

 long, bill straight, rather thick, upper mandible curved at the tip and distinct- 

 ly notched. Head above, cheeks and small space on the chin dark cinereous, 

 upper parts of body and wing coverts bright rufous, quills brownish black, 

 the two first edged externally with dark cinereous, others and especially the 

 shorter quills widely edged with the same bright rufous as the back, tail 

 brownish black, outer feathers edged with rufous. Under parts (except a 

 small space on the chin) white, tinged with dull yellowish brown on the breast 

 and flanks. Bill bluish black, legs pale yellowish (in dried skin.) Total 

 length about 6 inches, wing 4f , tail 2^, tarsus 1, bill from gape f inches. 



Hab. Camma river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 43 



This bird is, so far as I can see, exactly the same genus as the Asiatic T. 

 interpres alluded to above, and is about the same size. It is not a very good 

 Geocichla, of which T. citrinus is the type, but not a remote relative. One 

 specimen only in adult plumage is in the collection from the Camma. 



Genus Alethe, nobis. 



General form and aspect of Napothera, but with the bill thicker, the bristles 

 at the base of the upper mandible weaker and shorter, and in general charac- 

 ters more approaching Cossypha and Geocichla. Wing rather long, first quill 

 short, fourth and fifth longest, tail moderate, legs rather strong. 



75. Alethe castanea, (Cassin.) 



Napothera castanea, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada. 1856, p. 158. 



The adult is described by me as above from the river Moonda, and in the 

 present collection are intermediate and young specimens, the latter entirely 

 different from the adult, so much so indeed that were it not for more advanced 

 or intermediate specimens it would scarcely be suspected of being the same 

 species. They bear some resemblance to the young of Petrocincla. 



Young 5 Upper parts dark fuscous tinged with rufous on the rump and 

 every feather having an oblong or ovate central spot of light yellowish rufous, 

 wider on the back and wing coverts, narrower on the head. Under parts dull 

 yellowish rufous, many feathers on the breast edged with black, wings and 

 tail as in the adult. 



Several specimens from the Camma and formerly from the Moonda.

 Specimens from the Camma and formerly from the Moonda. 



Genus Trichophorus, Temminck, PL Col. iii. (liv. 14, about 1821.) 



Type T. barbatus, Temm. PI. col. 88. Bill strong, curved, rather wide at 

 base, nostril in a large cavity, aperture semicircular or crescent-shaped, rictal 

 bristles strong. Wing moderate, rounded, first quill short, fifth and sixth 

 quills longest, tail moderate, wide, legs short and rather slender, scales on 

 tarsi confluent or obscure. 



Belonging strictly to this group I have seen T. gularis (Horsfield) of Java, 

 T. sulphuratus (Midler) of Borneo, T. barbatus, Temm., T. olivaceus, Swains. 

 T. flaviventris, Smith, T. calurus, Cassin, and T. simplex, Hartlaub, of Africa, 

 and several other Asiatic species. All these have the bill strong and curved, 

 and several of them have the feathers of the head broad, somewhat length- 

 ened and probably erectile. Hairs on the back of the neck frequently long 

 and conspicuous. 



78. Trichophorus culoronotus, nobis. 



Strictly of the same group as T. gularis, Horsfield, and T. calurus, Cassin, 

 and resembling both, but larger. Feathers of the head broad and lengthened, 

 bristles on the back of the neck long and conspicuous, bill strong, curved, 

 legs and feet rather small, feathers of the lower back and rump lengthened. 

 Tail and upper coverts bright rufous, the outer feathers edged with greenish 

 yellow. Head above dark cinereous or plumbeous, cheeks plumbeous, every 

 feather with a medial line of white, back, rump and wings fine olive green, 

 tinged with yellow on the rump, quills brownish black, edged externally with 

 the olive green of the back, under wing coverts yellowish olive. Throat white, 

 breast cinereous (or plumbeous, nearly the same as the head above); abdomen 

 and under tail coverts greenish yellow. Bill bluish horn color, the edges of 

 1859.]

both mandibles white, legs light brown (in dried skin). Total length about 

 8 to 8 inches, wing 4, tail 3f , tarsus f , bill from gape 1^ inches. 



Hab. River Camma, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



This large species is another of the red tailed birds like my T. calurus, and 

 T. gularis, Horsfield, but differs entirely from those or any other that I have 

 ever seen or found described. The feathers of the head are wide, much as in 

 T. barbatus, and are lengthened, somewhat crest-like. The cinereous or plum- 

 beous color of tbe breast varies in shade in different specimens, and assumes 

 the form somewhat of a wide transverse band on the breast and upper part of 

 the abdomen. 



Several specimens are in the collection from the Camma. This is one of 

 the largest and handsomest known species of this genus. 



79. Tkichophorus calurus, Cassin. 



Trichophorus calurus, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Phila., viii. p. 158,(1856.) 

 Several specimens from the Camma do not differ from others formerly re- 

 ceived from the Muni, though presenting some variations in size and the 

 thickness of the bill. Female like the male in color, but with the feathers of 

 the head shorter and more compact, rather smaller than the male, and with 

 the bill weaker. 



80. Trichophorus simples, Hartlaub. 



"Trichophorus simplex, Temm." Hartl. Cab. Jour. hi. p. 356. 



Specimens from the Camma labelled as males are larger than as given by 

 Dr. Hartl tub as above, and the throat is pure white. Total length about 8J 

 inches, wing 4^, tail 4 inches. 



Though now first received from Mr. Duchaillu this species has been in the 

 Acad. coll. for about twenty years, having been received in Dr. Mac Dowall's 

 collection from St. Paul's river. I have regarded it as Ixos inornatus, Fraser, 

 erroneously as it now appears from the statements of authors, but rather dif- 

 ficult to determine from the description of the latter. This bird does assuredly 

 strongly approximate to typical Ixos both in form and color. 



Genus Xenocichla, Hartlaub, Orn. W. Afr. p. 86. 



Type X. syndactyla (Swainson). Bill strong, straight, rather wide at base, 

 compressed in its terminal half, type of upper mandible rather abruptly curved 

 or hooked, gonys ascending, rictal bristles strong. Wing moderate, fifth and 

 sixth quills longest, tail moderate or rather long, legs and feet moderate or 

 rather slender, but larger than in Trichophorus, scales on thetarsi hardly ob- 

 servable. Outer toe united to the middle toe nearly or quite to the last 

 joint. 



The main distinction of this genus from the preceding is in the bill, which, 

 instead of being wide and curved, is straight and compressed, and with the 

 gonys strongly ascending to the tip, and the union of the outer and middle 

 toe is also a strong character. This group is much more rapacious and shrike- 

 like in its characters than the preceding. Belonging to this group I have seen 

 X. syndactyla (Swainson), X. canicapellus (Hartlaub), X. notatus (Cassin), and 

 X. tricolor (Cassin). 



81. Xenocichla syndactyla, (Swainson). 



Dasycephala syndactyla, Swains. B. of W. Afr. i. p. 261, (1837.) 

 Trichophorus syndactylus, (Swains.) Hartlaub. 



This large and handsome species is in the collection from the Ogobai. It is? 

 the most shrike-like and rapacious species of this group that I have seen, and 

 both geuerically and specifically is strongly characterized. 



Large, bill straight, compressed. Tail and upper coverts bright rufous, up- 

 per parts dark olive, outer edges of quills with a tinge of rufous, under parts 

 greenish yellow, palest on the throat, the green more distinct on the breast 

 and sides. Total length about 9 inches, wing 4, tail 4 inches. Outer

 length. 

 Several specimens from the Ogobai river. 



82. Xenocichla notata, (Cassin.) 



Trichophorus notatus, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada. 1856, p. 159. 

 From the Camma, and formerly from the Moonda and Muni rivers. Easily- 

 distinguished by the large yellow spot in front of the eye, which is the color 

 also of the under parts of the body, tinged with green on the breast and sides. 

 Upper parts yellowish olive green, not so dark as in the preceding. Tail olive 

 green, nearly the same as other upper parts, four outer feathers on each side, 

 with large pale yellow spots at their tips, under wing coverts pale yellow. To- 

 tal length about 7J inches, wing 3|, tail 3 inches. Outer toe united to the 

 middle for about half its length. Female smaller and with the bill shorter, 

 but with the colors very nearly as in the male. 



83. Xenocichla tricolor, (Cassin.) 



Trichophorus tricolor, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada. 1857, p. 33. 

 From the Camma and formerly from the Muni river. Smaller than either 

 of the preceding two species. Tail and its upper coverts dark chestnut, 

 slightly tinged with greenish, entire upper parts olive green, under parts green- 

 ish yellow, clearer on the throat and more shaded with green on the breast 

 and sides, exposed ends of secondaries having a tinge of rufous or chestnut 

 like the tail. Total length about 6| inches, wing 3, tail 3 inches. Outer toe 

 united to the middle slightly beyond the first joint. Female smaller than the 

 male but similar in colors.

 Criniger xanthogaster, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada. 1855, p. 327 (April.) 

 Specimens from the Camma and formerly from the Moonda. This bird is 

 exactly the same genus to me as Criniger ictericus, Strickland, and another 

 species labelled in the Acad. Coll. " T. indicus, Ceylon." Sexes alike.

 This is a very bad Hemixos, but a worse Criniger or Trichophorus. It is a 

 heavy and strong bird with the bill wider and thicker and the tail shorter 

 than in either of the genera mentioned. It is for me the type of a generic or 

 sub-generic group approaching Cossypha and Geocichla in form, but different 

 in color.

Bill and feet pale colored, and under mandible almost entirely white in 

 both adult and young. Under wing coverts yellowish olive, fifth quill long- 

 est. Throat with a line on each side of pale yellow, very distinct in the adult, 

 and generally to be traced in the young ; entire upper parts dark olive, upper 

 tail coverts and tail greenish brown. Middle of throat and breast olive, abdo- 

 men pale greenish yellow, tibia? and under tail coverts reddish olive. Quills

 From the Camma and formerly from the Moonda. 



88. Andropadus virens, Cassin. 



Andropadus virens, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada. \857, p. 34. 



Smaller than either of the preceding, and more nearly related to the typical 

 A. importunus, of southern Africa. Bill and feet brownish horn color, the 

 latter lighter. Under wing coverts pale greenish yellow, inner edges of quills 

 very pale reddish white. Entire plumage olive, paler beneath, middle of ab- 

 domen yellow. Upper tail coverts and tail greenish brown. Total length 

 about 6 inches. 



This appears to be the most abundant species of Equatorial Africa, having 

 been received in all of Mr. Duchaillu's collections. 



89. Andropadus curvirostris, nobis. 



About the size of A. gracilirostris and latirostris. Bill rather narrow, curved, 

 serrations in upper mandible distinct. Under wing coverts pale greenish yel- 

 low. Upper parts olive, darker on the head, upper tail coverts and tail red- 

 dish brown, under parts lighter olive, tinged with reddish brown on the breast 

 and sides and inclining to yellow on the abdomen. Quills dark brown, edged 

 outwardly with olive, and on their inner edges with pale greenish yellow. 

 Bill and feet bluish horn color, edges of both mandibles white. Total length 

 about 6f inches, wing 3, tail 3 inches. 



Hab. River Camma, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



Tbis bird has the bill wider than in A. gracilirostris, and not so wide nor so 

 strong as in A. latirostris, and more curved than in either. I have heretofore 

 regarded it as the young of the former, but it appears to be a distinct species. 

 Numerous specimens from the Camma and formerly from the Muni.

 Evidently not an uncommon bird in Equatorial Africa. From the Camma, 

 and formerly in other collections from Mr. Duchaillu. 



Genus Pyrrhurus, nobis. 



Bill rather wide at base, upper mandible curved towards the end and dis- 

 tinctly notched, base with about 4 or 5 pairs of long and rather strong bristles. 

 Wing rather long, first quill short, fifth longest, legs and feet strong, claws 

 large, tail long, wide, rounded. Feathers of the head in front stiff and scale- 

 like. Type Phyllastrephus scandens. Swainson. 



92. Pyrrhurus pallescens, (Hartlaub.) 



Trichophorus pallescens, Hartl. Orn. W. Afr., p. 86, (1857.) 

 In the collection from the Ogobai are several specimens which agree so com- 

 pletely with Dr. Hartlaub's very careful description, cited above, that I cannot 

 avoid the conclusion that they are the species intended, though he gives the 

 locality of his specimens as "Gambia." The present specimens are precisely 

 of the same generic form as Phyllastrephus scandens, Swainson, and resemble 

 that species exceedingly in color also, but are smaller, as will be seen by Dr. 

 Hartlaub's description, and constantly differ in the color of the under parts of 

 the body and the under wing coverts. Specimens of P. scandens are in the 

 Acad, coll., labelled in the handwriting of Mr. Jules Verreaux. 



With undoubted specimens also before me of Phyllastrephus capensis from 

 the Cape of Good Hope, it is very palpable that these birds are not of the same 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 4" 



genus. In fact P. capensis has short wings, and P. scandens the wings long, 

 and in other points of structure these birds are quite different, though belong- 

 ing to the same group of Thrushes, and allied to Ixos and Andropadus. 



93. Pyrrhurus leucopleurus, (Cassin.) 



Phyllastrephus leucopleurus, Cassin, Proc. Acad. 1855, p. 328. 



Several specimens from the Camma do not vary materially from my descrip- 

 tion, as cited above. The affinities of this bird are more nearly to the prece- 

 ding and P. scandens than to any African birds with which I am acquainted, 

 but there are Asiatic species also to which it is related. The bristles at the 

 base of the bill in the present bird are smaller than in the preceding. 



This bird approximates to Asiatic birds, very confusedly given by authorB 

 as species of the genera Brachypus, Napothera, Trichophorus and others. It 

 quite considerably resembles a species received from the Leyden Museum, 

 labelled " Trichophorus striolatus, Miiller, Java," but is larger and has the 

 tail longer, though it is apparently of the same genus. There are also other 

 birds in the Acad. coll. variously estimated generically, but of the same group 

 as the present species. I arrange it here provisionally, until I can find out 

 further. 



94. Muscipeta flaviventris, Verreaux. 



Muscipeta flaviventris, Verr. Cab. Jour. iii. p. 103, (1855.) 



Muscipeta tricolor, Fraser ? 

 A very beautiful species, varying much at different ages, but recognizable by 

 the peculiar rich red orange or bay of the under parts. In the adult the 

 plumage on the upper parts of the body is orange yellow at the base of the 

 feathers, and on the rump the feathers are of the same color as the under parts, 

 but tipped with bluish ashy. With some displacement of the feathers the rump 

 might readily be supposed to be of the same color as the under parts. 

 Specimens from the Camma and from the Moonda are nearly all young.

Muscipeta Smithii, Fraser, Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1S43, p. 34. 

 Another very handsome species recognizable without difficulty from the 

 description as cited. This bird bears relations to both Muscipeta nigriceps 

 (Hartlaub)* and M. flaviventris, Verreaux, and in fact looks like a specimen 

 of the former, with the tail of the latter appended. Head glossy bluish black, 

 back, rump, wing coverts and entire under parts fine orange-rufous, quills and 

 tail brownish black, with a strong tinge of bluish ashy on the outer webs of 

 the feathers. Total length about 7| inches. The black of the head extends 

 further on the neck in this species than in M. nigriceps, and the color of the 

 tail is entirely different, being fine reddish or chestnut orange in the latter.

 Both sexes of this species are in the Acad, coll., having been received in Dr. 

 Macdowell's collection from St. Paul's river. Head and throat glossy purplish 

 black, quills dark brown, all other parts of the plumage, including tail, rich 

 orange rufous, inclining to chestnut on the breast, tail with the middle feathers 

 much the longest in the male. Female with the tail short, head and throat 

 dark brown, all other parts of the plumage dull orange rufous. Total length, 

 % about 9^ inches, < about 6 inches.

few only have been received from Mr. Duchaillu. With numerous specimens 

 of M. melanogastra in various stages of plumage, from the Gambia in the Acad. 

 Coll., I cannot avoid suspecting that the adult of the birds in the present col- 

 lection would be different. The young are much alike in general characters. 



98. Muscipeta spbciosa, nobis. 



Generally resembling M. melampyra, Verreaux, but smaller and with the tail 

 long, and having a white longitudinal stripe on the wing like M. melanogastra 

 and M. rufwentris. Tail long, with the two middle feathers much the longest, 

 others graduated, wing moderate, fifth quill longest, bill stout, rather wide and 

 thick but not so long as usual in this genus, bristles at base of both mandibles 

 conspicuous. Upper tail coverts in- adult glossy black. Head, neck and breast 

 glossy black with a green lustre, abdomen and under tail coverts dark bluish 

 ashy or nearly black, wing coverts and quills black, greater wing coverts widely 

 edged with white, secondary quills widely edged externally with white, (forming 

 a conspicuous white spot on the wing coverts, continued in a longitudinal stripfi 

 on the quills). Under wing coverts dark ashy, nearly black, same as the under 

 parts of the body. Upper parts of body fine rufous chestnut, shorter quills 

 edged with rufous chestnut. Tail rufous, rather lighter than the back, all the 

 feathers edged towards the end with brownish black, and the middle feathers 

 brownish black along their shafts and tipped with that color. Bill and feet black. 



Total length from tip of bill to end of tail about 9 inches, wing 3^, tail 6, 

 middle tail feathers exceed the next pair by 2^ inches, bill from gape -| inch. 



Hab. Camma river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



This is a species of the same general appearance as M. melanogastra, holose- 

 ricea, rnfiventris and others, and resembling in colors, especially of the under 

 parts of the body, M. melampyra as stated above. In M. melampyra, the under 

 tail coverts are bright rufous, and it has no white stripe on the wing. In the 

 present species, the under tail coverts are dark ashy, exactly the same as the 

 abdomen, and the white spot ami stripe on the wing are very conspicuous. The 

 upper tail coverts, especially the longest of them, next to the tail are lustrous 

 greenish black in the present bird, which character distinguishes it from all other 

 species with which I am acquainted. There is no other known African species 

 that has the under tail coverts dark cinereous, except M. senegalensis, Lesson, 

 which, however, only generally resembles the present bird, so far as can be 

 gathered from the descriptions.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 49 



This is one of the most remarkable birds yet discovered by Mr. Duchaillu, 

 and is also one of the handsomest species of Flycatchers yet known to inhabit 

 Western Africa. In general characters, this bird resembles the well known 

 Asiatic Muscipeta paradisi, and, as in that species, the male is chestnut colored 

 on the upper parts of the body, and the female is white. The present bird has 

 also relations to M. mutala, and others of Southern and Eastern Africa, but is 

 quite different.* 



* The following species of Muscipeta are in the Museum of this Academy. 



Asiatic. 



1. Muscipeta paradisi, (Linnaeus) Le Vaill. Ois d'Afr. iii. pi. 144, 145. 



2. Muscipeta afiinis, (Hay.)

African. 



7. Muscipeta cristata" (Gmelin,) Le Vaill. Ois d'Afr., iii. pi. 142, 143. 

 Numerous specimens from the Cape of Good Hope, and one specimen from 



" Nova Redonda, Western Africa." The latter collected and presented by Dr. 

 A. A. Henderson, Surgeon, U. S. Navy. 



8 Muscipeta borbonica, (Gmelin.) 



9. Muscipeta melanogastra, Swainson. 



Specimens from Gambia and others from Equatorial Africa, received from 

 Mr. Duchaillu. The latter I assign to this species with some hesitation. 



10. Muscipeta rufiventris, Swainson, B. of W. Afr., ii. pi. 4. 



11. Muscipeta mutata, (Gmelin) Le Vaill. Ois. d'Afr., iii. pi. 148. 



12. Muscipeta holosericea, (Temminck) Le Vaill. Ois. d'Afr. iii. pi. 147. 



13. " Muscipeta Gaimardi, Madagascar." Label in Rivoli Collection. 



The last three names I regard as possibly applicable to one species only, iu 

 stages of plumage analogous to those of M. paradisi, and of my M. Duchaillui, 

 but I advance this as an opinion only, at present. These three are all labelled 

 in the Acad. Coll. as from Madagascar. The last seems to be Tchilrea Gaimar- 

 di. Lesson, Traite, i. 386, which is stated to be from New Guinea, an error cor- 

 rected by M. Pucheran, in Arch, du Mus. Paris, vii. p. 372. 



14. Muscipeta Ferreti, (Guerin), Ferret et Galinier, Voy. Abyssinia, Ois. pi. 8. 

 Specimens of both sexes from Abyssinia. 



15. Muscipeta flaviventris, (Verreaux). 



16. Muscipeta melampyra, (Verreaux). 



17. Muscipeta Smithii, Fraser. 



18. Muscipeta nigriceps, (Hartlaub). 



19. Muscipeta speciosa, Cassin. 



20. Muscipeta Duchaillui, Cassin. 



Of these species there are several subgeneric groups, one of the most distinct 

 of which is composed of M, flaviventris, Smithii, and melampyra. In addition to 

 the species here given, there are various others in the Acad. Coll., nearly re- 

 lated, if not actually entitled to be included in the genus Muscipeta; for in- 

 stance, Muscicapa pyrrhoptera, Temm., which is placed by Bonaparte in the ge- 

 nus Philentoma, Eyton, but with doubtful propriety as a congener of P. velatum 

 and Muscicapa cyanomelas. For me, the first three species of Philentoma, as ar- 

 ranged by Bonaparte, (Consp. Av. i. p. 314,) belong to three different genera. 

 The fourth species I do not know.

50 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



To this beautiful species, I have great pleasure iu applying the name of Mr. 

 Uuchaillu, who, in the three )'ears past, during which he has been in Africa, 

 has fairly earned the distinction of being the most successful zoological tra- 

 veller of the present time, and who has, in ornithology especially, made very 

 important discoveries. 



100. Trochocercus nitens, nobis. 



Of the same generic group as Musdcapa cyanomelas, Vieill. Le Vaill. Ois. 

 d'Afr. iv. pi. 151, and in some measure resembling that species. Crested, bill 

 smaller and more narrow than in typical species of Muscipeta, wing moderate, 

 fifth quill longest, tail moderate, bristles at the base of both mandibles strong, 

 and nearly as long as the bill. 



6 Head, breast, and entire upper parts glossy bluish black, which is also 

 the color of the wings and tail. Abdomen and under tail coverts light cinere- 

 ous, very pale or nearly white next to the black color on the breast, under wing 

 coverts white, bill and feet bluish gray. 



5 . Top of head (or crest) only glossy black as in the male, back and other 

 upper parts dark cinereous, (without lustre,) wings and tail ashy black. Entire 

 under parts light cinereous, darker on the throat and breast, and very pale on 

 the abdomen, under wing coverts light ashy, nearly white. Total length, % , 

 about 5| inches, wing 2i, tail 2| inches. % slightly smaller. 



Hab. Camma river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



This is a second species of the same group to which belongs Muscicapa cyano- 

 melas, Le Vaill Ois. d'Afr. iv. pi. 151, as stated above, but is a very distinct 

 and well marked species, entirely without the white scapulars and tertiaries 

 which so strongly mark that bird, and are well represented in Le Yaillant's 

 plate cited above. In the male, the head and breast and entire upper parts of 

 the body, including the wing coverts and shorter quills, are lustrous bluish 

 black, changing to greenish according to the light. The abdomen is clear 

 ashy, very pale next to the black of the breast, and there almost assuming the 

 form of a transverse narrow band of ashy white. 



Several specimens of both sexes of this interesting little bird are in the col- 

 lection from the Camma and Rembo rivers. 



101. Trochocercus ? 



Several specimens of young birds in the collection from the Camma seem 

 to indicate a third species of this group larger than either T. cyanomelas or T. 

 nitens. Young of both sexes resemble the females of both the species just 

 mentioned, but are of darker cinereous, and like them have the crest only 

 black. The bill is larger and more depressed. I do not regard it as expedient 

 to propose a new specific designation in this difficult family, without having 

 adult specimens.

Gould, B. of Eur. pi. 65. Naumann, B. Germ. pi. 64. 

 Several specimens from the Ogobai and Rembo, not distinguishable from the 

 European bird, but are not in fully adult plumage. In the African specimens 

 the bill is smaller than usual in this species from Europe, but they do not 

 appear to be specifically distinct. 



107. Muscicapa, ? 



A second species of typical Muscicapa, in the collection from the Camma, but 

 which I cannot identify with any species or description with which I am ac- 

 quainted. Adult Upper parts clear bluish-ashy, lighter on the rump, and 

 with longitudinal lines of brownish black on the head. Throat and abdomen 

 white, breast pale ashy, nearly the same as the back, under wing coverts ashy 

 white, quills and tail brownish black. An obscure line of ashy white in front 

 of the eye. Bill and feet black. Young % . Upper parts cinereous, many fea- 

 thers, with large terminal spots of dull yellowish, under parts dull white, with 

 spots and edging of brownish black. Tail black, narrowlv tipped with white. 



Total length about 5 inches, wing 2|, tail 2\ inches. 



108. Muscicapa epulata, (Cassin). 



Butalis epulatus, Cassia, Proc. Acad. Philada. 1855, p. 326. 

 Specimens show some difference in the shade of ashy of the upper parts, but 

 appear to be identical. In the more adult the lower mandible and the feet are 

 light colored or nearly white in the dried skin. From the Camma. 



109. Ervthrocercus McCallii, (Cassin). 



Pycnosphrys McCallii, Ca?sin. Proc. Acad. Philada. 1855, p. 326. 

 A single specimen from the Camma, not different in any respect from that 

 formerly received from the Moonda.

Tephrodornis ocreatus, Strickl. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1844, p. 102. 



Fraser, Zool. Typ. Birds, pi. 36. 

 Both sexes from the Camma. The dark edgings of the plumage of the breast 

 varies in different specimens, in some extending to the sides and abdomen, in 

 others nearly obsolete. Sexes nearly alike in colors, female smaller. 



112. Fraseria cinerascens, Hartlaub. 



" Stiphrornis cinerascens, Temm. Mus. Lugd." Hartl. Orn. W. Afr. p. 102. 

 This species much resembles the preceding, but is smaller, and can be easily 

 distinguished by the white spot ia front and over the eye, which is present in 

 both sexes at all ages. Sexes very nearly alike, but the female and young male 

 generally have the breast and flanks strongly tinged with dull fulvous or ochre 

 color. From the Camma and Ogobai. 



113. Parisoma melanurum, nobis. 



About the size of P. subcaeruleum, (Vieill.) Le Vaill. Ois. d'Afr. iii. pi. 126. 

 Bill rather thick, upper mandible distinctly notched, under mandible with the 

 ridge ascending, wing moderate, first quill short, fourth longest, tail rather 

 long, legs rather long. Middle six feathers of the tail black, outer two white, 

 intermediate black, tipped with white. Entire plumage cinereous, darker on 

 the head and upper parts of the body, lighter on the throat and breast, and 

 nearly white on the abdomen. An obscure white line in front of the eye. 

 Under wing coverts ashy white, under tail coverts pale fulvous. Quills brown 

 edged externally with ashy white. Bill light corneous, under mandible white

at base, tarsi light bluish. Young 5 Entire under parts ashy, many of the 

 feathers edged with light rufous, under tail coverts pale rufous, upper parts 

 darker ashy, wing coverts and quills edged with pale rufous. Total length 

 about 5^ inches, wing 2|, tail 2\ inches. 



Hab. Camma river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



About the same size as the South African Parisoma, mentioned above, but 

 with the bill thicker and longer. In the young bird the under tail coverts are 

 pale rufous, which color becomes more indistinct, and assumes a fulvous shade 

 in more advanced age. Several specimens from the Camma and Itembo. Sexes 

 alike. 



114. Parisoma olivascens, nobis. 



About the size of the preceding, or slightly larger; bill shorter and thicker, 

 tail rather long. Entire upper parts ashy olive, wings and tail olive brown, 

 quills edged externally with pale yellowish ashy, and internally with white. 

 Throat, and under tail coverts white, breast and abdomen greenish ashy, paler 

 on the latter, under wing coverts white. Fpper mandible bluish corneous, 

 under mandible yellowish white, legs pale colored. Total length 5| inches, 

 wings 2f, tail 2\ inches. 



Hab. Camma river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



This bird is of the same general form as the preceding, but has the bill 

 stronger, and the colors of the plumage are entirely different. The tail in the 

 present bird is greenish brown, the outer feathers more distinctly edged with 

 ashy olive, very nearly uniform with the upper parts of the body. One speci- 

 men only is in the collection from the Camma, and is labelled as a male. Both 

 the species here described have the bills longer and thicker than P. subcaeru- 

 leum. 



Genus Hypodes, nobis. 

 Allied to Parisoma, but with the general form shorter and stronger. Tail 

 short, bill thick, rather wide at base, upper mandible distinctly notched at the 

 tip, bristles at base of the upper mandible distinct, wing moderate or rather 

 long, first quill short, third and fourth longest and nearly equal, legs and feet 

 moderate, or rather slender. Type Eopsaltria cinerea, Cassin. 



115. Hypodes cinerea, (Cassin). 



Eopsaltria cinerea, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada. 1856, p. 253. 

 This little bird is allied to the preceding two species, but is generically dis- 

 tinct, and has the tail short, while in those the tail is rather unusually long. 

 In my judgment this bird and Parisoma are not distant relations of Virco and 

 Eopsaltria. 



116. Campephaga nigra, Vieillot. 



Campephaga nigra, Vieill. 



Le Vaill. Ois. d'Afr. iv. pi. 165. 



There is a constant difference in the metallic lustre of different specimens, 

 almost inclining me to the opinion, that they are two species. Both are en- 

 tirely black, and about the same size, but the lustre of one is green, and of the 

 other rich purple and violet. The former is strictly identical with South African 

 specimens in Acad. Coll. 



From the Camma, and formerly from the Muni. 



117. Lobotos Temminckii, Hartlaub? 



Lobotos Temminckii, Hartl. Orn. W. Afr. p. 99? 

 Ceblepyris lobatus, Temm. PI. Col. 279, 280 ? 

 A single specimen labelled as a young male, is either this species or an un- 

 described bird. It much resembles the figure of the female given by Temm. in 

 PI. Col. 280, but has the entire head cinereous, darker on the top of the head, 

 lighter and nearly white on the throat. Upper part of body yellowish olive, 

 under parts fine yellow, quills dark brown, edged internally with yellow, tail 

 olive, external feathers with their outer webs yellow. Total length 7f inches.

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 53 



118. Ceblepyris azurea, (Cassin.) 



Graucalus azureus, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada. 1851, p. 348. 

 Two specimens in the collection from the Gamma, and so far as I am informed 

 the only known specimens except that formerly received from Dr. Macdowell, 

 and described by me as above. It is with much gratification that I record the 

 second occurrence of this species, which is quite peculiar amongst the African 

 birds of this group, and is strongly distinguished by its uniform blue plumage. 

 The present specimens are fully adult, being rather larger than that described 

 by me, and have the quills uniform clear black, without the white transverse 

 lines at the end, which are in the original specimen, and seem to mark a 

 younger bird. Total length about 8 inches. The general appearance of this 

 bird is not unlike that of the young or immature plumage of Irena puella of 

 Asia. 



119. Dicrurus coracinus, Verreaux. 



Dicrurus coracinus, J. & E. Verreaux, Rev. et Mag. Zool. 1851, p. 311. 

 From the Camma and Ogobai, and strictly identical with specimens from Mr. 

 Verreaux, in the museum of this Academy, 



120. Dicrcrcs atripennis, Swainson ? 



Dicrurus atripennis, Swains. B. of W. Afr. i. p. 256? 

 Several specimens which I doubtfully refer to this species. It is smaller than 

 the dimensions given by Swainson as above, the total length being about 8 

 inches, but is evidently nearly allied, if not identical with his species. This 

 bird has the tail but very slightly forked, and bears relations also to my D. 

 aculeatus and to D. Ludwigii, Smith, of Eastern and Southern Africa, both of 

 which are now before me. D. atripennis is not in the Academy collection. 



121. Sigmodus rufiventris, Bonaparte. 



Sigmodus rufiventris, Bonap. Rev. et Mag. Zool. 1853, p. 441. 

 Several specimens from tlie Ogobai and formerly from the Moonda. Sexes 

 alike, except that in the female the head above is clear white, without the tinge 

 of cinereous generally to be seen in specimens. This species is rather smaller 

 and quite distinct from S. caniceps. Temminck.

 Lesson, Cent. Zool. pi. 65. 



Very fine specimens of this beautiful species are from the Ogobai and Rembo 

 and formerly from the Moonda. The female is similar to the male in general 

 characters, but is rather smaller and has the colors less distinct.

 Laniarius lepidus, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada. vii. p. 327, (1855.) 

 The description of Lanius chloris, as cited above, is not sufficient to identify 

 it with this or any other species. In applying this name to the bird now before 

 me, I rely entirely on the conclusion of Dr. Hartlaub, in Orn. W. Afr., p. 109, 

 and necessarily disregarding the statement made by the Prince Bonaparte that 

 L. chloris is a second species of the genus Ixonotus, Verreaux (Comptes Ren- 

 dus, Acad. Paris, 1854, p. 533.)

 Telophonus leucorhynchus, Hartlaub, Rev. Zool. 1848, p. 108? 



Trans. Nat. Hist. Soc. Hamburg, 1848, pi. 6 ? 



Though the names here given seem to be regarded as certainly synonymous 

 by very reliable ornithologists, I have never been able to reconcile that conclu- 

 sion with the fact that both sexes of my D. carbonarius have the bill black. 

 In T. leucorhynchus, the bill of the male is white, and that of the female black, 

 and the measurements given as above, and elsewhere, with his usual accuracy, 

 by Dr. Hartlaub, are smaller than in specimens of my species. 



There are, in Mr. Duchaillu's collections, numerous specimens of L. carbona- 

 rius of both sexes, and very similar in all their characters, but previous to the 

 arrival of the present collection from the Camma, I had never seen a specimen 

 with the bill light colored, or of any other color than black. In this col- 

 lection, however, there are two specimens evidently not in mature plumage, one 

 of which, labelled as a male, has the bill varied with dull brownish black and 

 pale yellowish white, and showing a tendency to become either white or black, 

 but impossible to determine which. These two specimens are smaller than 

 those of L. carbonarius, being very nearly the size given by Dr. Hartlaub, and 

 have the plumage more strongly tinged with brown as represented in his plate 

 cited above. My opinion is, at present, that the two species are distinct.

 bense," of the Acad. Coll. and generally resembling those species in colors, but 

 larger than either of them. Bill rather large, wing moderate, rounded, fifth 

 quill longest, tail moderate, rounded, legs rather long, feathers of the back long, 

 soft, bristles at the base of the bill strong. Head above dark ashy brown, 

 cheeks ashy, throat ashy white. Upper parts of body reddish-brown, with a 

 tinge of olive on the back, and becoming clear dark ferrugineous on the rump 

 and upper tail coverts. Under parts of body dull ashy white, much tinged with 

 dull ochraceous or fulvous on the breast and sides. In some specimens the en- 

 tire under parts are dull reddish fulvous. Quills dark brown, edged externally 

 with the same color as the back, tail dark chestnut brown. Bill with the upper 

 mandible horn color, under mandible yellowish white, legs light brownish. 9 

 Smaller, and with the plumage more strongly tinged with ferrugineous on the 

 upper parts, throat ashy white, under parts of body ashy white in some speci- 

 mens, dull fulvous in others.

Hab. River Camma, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



To me this bird is exactly the same genus as a species in the Acad. Coll. 

 labelled in Europe, " Myiothera philomela, Temm. Borneo," and is nearly related 

 to others as stated above. Its colors much resemble those of the species just 

 mentioned, and also of " Trichostoma umbralile and celebensis," of which very in- 

 different figures are given in Jardine's Cont. Orn. for Nov. 1849. The tails ia

these two birds are not unusually short as represented in the plate alluded to, 

 and in other respects the figures are scarcely recognizable with the original 

 specimens before me. These species are included in the genus Turdirostris, Hay, 

 Bonap. Comp. Av. i. p. 217. 



The present bird presents considerable diversity in the shade of colors, and 

 especially in the greater or less prevalence of ferrugineous or dark fulvous on 

 both the upper and under parts of the body. So far as I know, it is the first 

 species yet ascertained to inhabit Western Africa, of a group of birds quite 

 numerous in the islands of the Malay Archipelago, at about the same latitude 

 of Mr. Duchaillu's operations, or within a few degrees of the Equator. In fact, 

 species from equatorial Africa, similar to others in the equatorial Asiatic Isl- 

 ands, have now been discovered to such extent as to be quite remarkable. 



With this species I conclude the Dentiroslres of the present very interesting 

 collection, and hope to continue this Catalogue without intermission next 

 month.

ICHTHYOLOGICAL NOTICES. 

 BY CHARLES GIRARD, M. D. 



V. We have often had an opportunity to speak of curious traits of organi- 

 zation amongst the fishes of California and Oregon, but we think that the 

 species which is the subject of this paragraph, yields nothing in that respect 

 to those alluded to elsewhere. 



Let it be stated at once that it belongs to the blennioid family, as now un- 

 derstood by us, and will enter into the genus Neoclinus, as characterised in 

 the "Report upon the Fishes of the U. S. P. R. R. Expl. and Surveys," with- 

 out any material modification of its diagnosis. And yet when we first beheld 

 this singular creature prior to any examination of its organic structure we 

 were far from suspecting its natural affinities to the family to which it belongs 

 in reality. The fish is from eight to nine inches in total length ; its body is 

 very much compressed and tapering ; the head being about two inches long and 

 deeper than broad, superiorly convex, anteriorly rounded off ; the branchial 

 apertures are widely open, continuous under the throat ; the mouth is deeply 



[Feb. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 57 



cleft ; the pectorals and ventrals, and the fins generally, assume a position and 

 an aspect, not departing from the normal rule in that family. In the charac- 

 ters thus far enumerated, there is nothing to attract very particularly the at- 

 tention, except, perhaps, the'broad exit to the respiratory stream ; and, as far 

 as the dentition is concerned, we have already stated its type by referring the 

 species to the genus Neoclinus. But now imagine a fish with all these charac- 

 ters, provided with a mouth very wide and deeply cleft, with the maxillar bones 

 in their usual position, developed beyond all proportions ; so much so that their 

 posterior extremity, which is considerably dilated, extends beyond the bran- 

 chiostegal apparatus. Between the cheeks and the inner edge of the maxillar 

 bones there is a connecting membrane, which measures about an inch and 

 a half along its posterior edge, and gives the mouth an enormous amplitude 

 when viewed in front ; both maxillars stretched. The same membrane extends 

 from the angle of the mouth, along the lower jaw to near its apex or sym- 

 physis, towards which it tapers. That abnormal development of the maxillar 

 bones reminds us of a similar peculiarity of structure in Opistognathus sonnerati, 

 upon which species the genus Opistognathus was founded. Another species of 

 the same genus Opistognathus, however, 0. ruvieri, does not possess the same 

 feature, and the generic characters of Opistognathus are now derived from other 

 structural traits. In treating of Neoclinus it will be recollected, we alluded to 

 the natural affinities between these two genera. They differ chiefly by the 

 dentition and the structure of the ventral fins : Neoclinus having conspicuous 

 palatine teeth and three articulated rays only to the ventrals ; whilst Opistog- 

 nathus has the palate toothless, or nearly so, and is provided with five articu- 

 lated rays to its ventral fins. The pectorals, dorsal, anal and caudal fins 

 present the same general appearance in both genera. Even the scales are 

 similar : they being small, imbricated and cycloid in their structure. The air 

 bladder, which is wanting in Neoclinus, is extant in Opistognathus. 



It is more than probable that had we been acquainted with this second 

 species of Neoclinus first, we would have been misled as to its real generical 

 characters, and framed a name in allusion to the condition of the upper jaw, 

 such as Pterognathus for example, which would have been most characteristic, 

 for that upper jaw is as truly winged as the anterior members of the flying 

 squirrels. We cannot help thinking that Cuvier himself would not have coined 

 the name of Opistognathus had he had before him the species which bears his 

 name, instead of that which he dedicated to Sonnerat. 



These two genera (Opistognathus and Neoclinus,) will furnish one of the best 

 themes to ichthyological studies, as they exemplify the fact that specific char- 

 acters may be developed to exaggeration, and become more conspicuous than 

 the generic characters themselves. 



Returning now to the principal object of this paragraph, which is to record 

 a second species in the genus Neoclinus, and to which we give the name of N. 

 satiricus, the chief difference between the latter and N. blanchafdi resides in 

 development of the maxillar bones, above alluded to. The cephalic membra- 

 nous flaps or tentacles, which we noticed in the species formerly described. 

 do not appear to exist in the present one ; so that their expression will have 

 to be stricken out from the generical diagnosis. The formula of the rays : Br. 

 vi : vi ; D 42 ; A 29 ; C 3, 1, 5, 4, 1, 4 ; V 1, 3 ; P 14, bears a great resemblance 

 to that of N. blanchardi ; we have not been able to ascertain how many of the 

 rays of the dorsal fin are simple and unarticulated. The insertion of the ven- 

 trals takes place somewhat more in advance of the pectorals than in the species 

 just alluded to. 



The color is uniform olivaceous brown, with a bluish black tint prevailing 

 over the sides of the head and the fins. The maxillar membrane is posteriorly 

 white edged, as in N. blanchardi. 



The only specimen of this species that has come to our knowledge, was 

 caught at a depth of thirty fathoms, in the Bay of Monterey, r Cala., and sent to 

 the museum of the Smithsonian Institution by A. S. Taylor, Esq., to whom

science is already indebted for some of the rarest ichthyological and careino- 

 logical productions of the Pacific coast. 



VI. A few months have scarcely elapsed sincere stated that no representa- 

 tives of the sub-order of apod malacopterian fishes had so far been observed 

 along the Pacific coast, west of the United States. We are now in possession 

 from that coast of a fine species, which, according to Kaup's classification, be- 

 longs to the family Opkisuridce, and more properly still to the subfamily Myro- 

 phincB. Its generical affinities are with Myrus, from which it, however, differs 

 by the dentition and the condition of the dorsal fin. The genus to which it 

 belongs may be characterized as follows : Pectoral fins present. Origin of 

 dorsal fin situated near the occiput, in advance of the base of the pectorals. 

 Head large, subcorneal, lower jaw shorter than the upper. Teeth granular, 

 disposed upon elongated patches, on the jaws, palate and nasal bones Eyes 

 well developed. Gill apertures lateral, of moderate development, and placed 

 vertically in advance of the pectoral fins. Body scaleless. A specimen from 

 Adair Bay, Oregon, measures about two feet in total length. Its body is sub- 

 cylindrical, somewhat compressed, and tapering gradually backwards. The 

 origin of the dorsal fin takes place near the occipital region, upon a vertical 

 line somewhat nearer the base of the pectorals than the posterior rim of the 

 eye. The beginning of the anal fin is nearer the extremity of the snout than 

 the tip of the tail. The pectoral fins are subelliptical in their outline, broader 

 than long. The head, from the apex of the rostrum to the branchial 

 aperture, measures about two inches, or else the twelfth part of the 

 total length ; it is subcorneal, anteriorly attenuated, the upper jaw projecting 

 considerably beyond the lower one. The gape of the mouth is nearly hori- 

 zontal ; its angles extending considerably beyond the orbits. The teeth are 

 subcorneal or hemidiscoid, granular or sand like in general appearance and of 

 various sizes ; very small ones occupying the intervening space between the 

 largest. They are disposed upon multiple series : three of these may be ob- 

 served towards the anterior portion of the dentary (lower jaw), whilst one 

 only extends backwards along that bone. There is a double series of them at 

 the upper jaw ; a double series also along the shaft of the vomer, the latter 

 being continuous forwards with the nasal patch, where three or four series exist. 

 The nostrils approximate the apex of the rostrum ; the upper ones are very 

 small, and placed opposite the inferior ones, which are conspicuous and tubu- 

 lar. The eyes are subelliptical and well developed ; their longitudinal diame- 

 ter entering twice upon the rostral distance anterior to the orbits. 



The ground color is brownish olive, except the throat and belly which 

 are of a dull whitish tint. Rounded, dark brown spots, rather diffuse at their 

 periphery, constitute four longitudinal series from head to tail, leaving but the 

 abdominal region unicolor, for the throat exhibits small, blackish spots. The 

 spots about the head are likewise a good deal smaller and of a deeper hue 

 than along the rest of the body. The fins are olivaceous ; the anal and pecto- 

 rals being unicolor, whilst the dorsal fin is edged with white and exhibits 

 moreover a series of spots similar to those observed on the body. 



We have selected the name of Myrichthys tigrinus for the above species. The 

 specimen upon which the foregoing observations were made, was caught in 

 Adair Bay, Oregon, by Capt. C. P. Stone, and presented to the Museum of the 

 Smithsonian Institution. 



VII. A few years ago we have established the genus Cyprinella to include 

 sundry species of small cyprinoid fishes apparently very numerous in the 

 rivers and streams lying westwardly to the main bed of the Mississippi, as 

 well as in Texas and the Mexican provinces adjoining the Rio Grande del Norte 

 (Rio Bravo). Up to the time our reports upon these fishes passed through 

 the press, we had not met with any species of that genus east of the Alleghany 

 range. We are now in possession of numerous specimens of various sizes, 

 from an inch to three inches in total length, which appears to be the full grown 



[Feb. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OE PHILADELPHIA. 59 



condition of the species. They were obtained from the waters of Rock creek, 

 which flows into the Potomac river nearly opposite Analostan island. In 

 general appearance they resemble young shiners (Luxilus americanus), for 

 which they might easily be taken by superficial observers. Upon a closer ex- 

 amination, however, the generic features, as pointed out elsewhere, become so 

 obvious, that when once observed, they can never fail to attract attention. 

 The body is elongated and subfusiform in profile ; the peduncle of the tail 

 being stoutish. The head enters four times and a half in the total length. 

 The eye is of moderate development and circular in shape ; its diameter enter- 

 ing about four times in the length of the side of the head. The snout is sub- 

 conical, and the fact of its projecting beyond the lower jaw is a trait partaken 

 more or less by all the species of this genus ; the gape of the mouth is directed 

 somewhat obliquely upwards ; the posterior extremity of the maxillar bone 

 corresponds to a vertical line drawn between the nostrils and the anterior rim 

 of the orbit. The dorsal fin is rather elevated, superiorly rounded off ; its an- 

 terior margin is equidistant between the apex of the snout and the last scales 

 at the base of the caudal fin. The origin of the ventral fins takes place some- 

 what anteriorly to the dorsal. The anal fin is deeper than long. The ventrals 

 are broader and shorter than the pectorals. The scales are larger than those 

 of the shiner (Luxilus americanus) and the lateral line, though defiexed, is much 

 less so than in the fish just alluded to. The color is uniformly silvery ; greyish 

 olive along the dorsal region, and of a metallic reflect over the rest of the body 

 and sides of the head. The fins are unicolor, except the dorsal which exhibits 

 a black spot at its posterior margin. 



The species referred to in this paragraph resembles C. whipplii most, with 

 this chief difference, that the dorsal fin is less elevated, and the ventral fins 

 situated somewhat more anteriorly. The minor differences will suggest them- 

 selves upon the comparison of their respective diagnosis. We think that the 

 name of C. analostana may, with great propriety, be bestowed upon it. 



VIII. Our friend, Townend Glover, has just brought us from Palatka, East 

 Florida, a Cyprinodont, of the genus Fundulus. The specimen is unique, and 

 belongs to the male sex. Compared to F. grandis, of which it has the length, 

 the body is more slender, and subfusiform in general appearance. The great- 

 est depth, taken at the origin of the ventral fins, is equal to the length of the 

 head, which enters four times and one third in the total length. The scales 

 which cover the upper surface of the head and the opercular apparatus, are of 

 moderate development. The head is subpyramidal, the snout tapering, and 

 the mouth rather small. The eye is subcircular, of medium size ; its diameter 

 entering about four times and a half in the length of the side of the head. The 

 dorsal fin is longer than high ; it is higher posteriorly than anteriorly, and its 

 origin is nearer the apex of the snout than the extremity of the caudal fin. 

 The latter is subtruncated or subconvex, and constitutes nearly the sixth of 

 the total length. The anal is deeper than its base is long, subtriangular to- 

 wards its extremity which projects further back than the dorsal. The ventrals 

 are broad and short, not extending quite to the vent, which is situated near 

 the anterior margin of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are likewise broad and 

 short, although much more developed than the ventrals ; their posterior ex- 

 tremity is nearly even with a vertical line drawn at the origin of the latter fins. 

 The rays stand as follows : D 17 ; A 134-1 ; C 5, 1, 8, 7, 1, 5 ; V 6 ; P 17. 

 The scales are much deeper than long, anteriorly truncated and rounded upon 

 the rest of the periphery. Radiating furrows are observed upon their anterior 

 section only. The ground color is yellowish brown, quite dark along the dor- 

 sal region, spotted with black ; whitish and unicolor beneath. The spots cor- 

 responding to the scales, upon the line of their intersection. The dorsal and 

 caudal fins are likewise spotted, and assume a reticulated appearance. The 

 anal and the ventrals being yellowish and unicolor, the edge of the anal alone 

 is blackish, whilst the pectorals are greyish olive.

60 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



The throat and inferior surface of the head exhibit the same tint as the abdo- 

 men. The sides of the head are yellowish brown, whilst its upper surface is 

 rather dark and blackish. Finding no species on record with which the pre- 

 sent one can be identified, the name of Fundulus seminolis may not be deemed 

 inappropriate to designate it henceforward. 



IX. The fish which we have formerly described (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., 

 Philada. vi. 1853, 389), under the name of Fundulus tenellus, from specimens 

 obtained at Prairie Mer Rouge, La., and Russellville, Ky., belongs to the genus 

 Zygonectes, proposed by Professor Agassiz (Amer. Journ. of Sci. and Arts, 

 second series, xvi. 1853, 135), so that its present systematic name will be Z. 

 tenellus. We should not be surprised at all to hear that the latter is identical 

 with either one or the other of the sundry species of that genus, which Professor 

 Agassiz has named without characterizing (Amer. Journ. of Sci. and Arts, sec- 

 ond series, xvii. 1S54, 353), except by alluding to their coloration. The cha- 

 racters of the genus itself, were never defined, so that ere long, we may expect 

 to encounter as much difficulty in identifying its species, as we meet with those 

 recorded in the " Ichthyologia Ohiensis." 



X. The party under Lieut. J. C. Ives, has brought home a very remarkable 

 species of Hydrargyra, which was collected ' ' between Fort Defiance and Fort 

 Union, New Mexico." It is probable, therefore, that it was caught in one of 

 the upper affluents of the Rio Grande del Norte (Rio Bravo). 



The average size of the specimens now before us is about three inches, in males 

 as well as in females. The sexual differences reside, as usual in this genus, in the 

 dorsal and anal fins, which are more developed in the male than in the female. 

 The body is elongated, compressed, and subfusiform in profile ; the back being 

 slightly arched. The head is subpyramidal, very much depressed above, en- 

 tering about four times and a half in the total length, and apparently some- 

 what smaller in proportion in the female than in the male. The eye is subel- 

 liptical ; its longitudinal diameter being contained four times, or a little more, 

 in the length of the side of the head. The dorsal fin is longer than higb ; its 

 base entering six times and a half in the total length ; its origin, in the male, 

 is nearly equidistant between the apex of the snout and the posterior margin 

 of the caudal, whilst in the female it takes place much more posteriorly. The 

 insertion of the anal fin is the same, with reference to the dorsal in either sex, 

 but, since the posterior portion of the dorsal, in the male, is more developed 

 than in the female, the consequence is that it is nearly even with the posterior 

 extremity of the anal, whilst in the female, the latter stretches considerably be- 

 yond the extremity of the dorsal. The anal fin itself is as long as deep in the 

 male, and deeper than long, in the female ; exteriorly rounded off in either 

 sex. Its anterior margin, in the female, is overlapped by the membranous 

 expansion of the genital foramen. The caudal fin is subtruncated. The ven- 

 trals are short and broad ; their extremities reaching the anterior margin*of the 

 anal in the male, which is not the case in the female. The pectorals are of 

 moderate development, subovate in their outline, approximating by their ex- 

 tremity the insertion of the ventrals in the male, remaining more apart in the 

 female. The numbers of the fins rays are ; D 13 ; A 14; C 6, 1, 7, 7, 1, 6 : 

 V 5 ; P 17. The scales are comparatively smaller than in H. similis, and differ 

 furthermore from those of the latter species in being much deeper than long. 

 They are subquadrangular in shape, and furrowed upon their anterior section 

 alone. The ground color of the upper region of the head and body is olivace- 

 ous-brown, with a blackish, small spot upon either scale, giving that region 

 quite a dark appearance : whilst a yellowish tint prevails along the sides and 

 beneath. Transverse, narrow black bars or bands, much more conspicuous in 

 the male than in the female, may be observed from the insertion of the pecto- 

 rals to the base of the caudal, about sixteen in number, and extending from 

 the dorsal line to the belly. The intervening spaces are somewhat wider than 



[Feb. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 61 



the bands themselves. The fins are greyish olive, unieolor ; the anal and the 

 ventrals, in the female, being oftentimes of a lighter tint. 



In allusion to the numerous transverse lateral bars, we shall call this species 

 Hydrargyra zebra. 



XL In 1853, (Amer. Journ. of Sci. and Arts, second series, xvi. 135), the 

 genus Heterandria was proposed to include two small species of fish inhabiting 

 the fresh water ditches of South Carolina. All that we were told about their 

 generical characters had reference to the anal fin, which in the male sex, is very- 

 slender and deep and inserted more anteriorly than in the female. That dif- 

 ference between the sexes suggested the appellation of Heterandria. Most 

 genera of the so called Cyprinodonts, however, exhibit similar sexual dif- 

 ferences in a greater or lesser degree. 



In the same year, 1853, we described four species under the head of Heteran- 

 dria, three of which we have recently* referred to the genus Gambusia, and one 

 to the genus Girardinus, proposed by Prof. Poey, of Havana, to include sundry 

 Cuban species. The genus Limia, of the same author, would likewise fall 

 under the head of Heterandria, as indicated. The genera just alluded to of the 

 Cuban naturalist, not only cover the same ground as Heterandria, but have 

 priority over the latter. 



The following characters may be assigned to the genus Gambusia. Mouth 

 protractile, rather cleft and nearly horizontal, the lower jaw projecting some- 

 what beyond the upper. An external series of rather conical, curved and 

 conspicuous teeth, behind which may be observed a patch of velvet like teeth. 

 The origin of the anal fin is situated in advance of the anterior margin of the 

 dorsal, deeper and differently constructed in the male than in the female. 

 The branchiostegal rays numbering six on either side ; the branchial orifices 

 being continuous under the throat. Prof. Poey states that the intestine is 

 short, and the liver large, t 



Amongst the fishes recently collected by Mr. T. Glover, at Palatka, East 

 Florida, we find specimens of a species of Gambusia, which upon comparison 

 with the specimens of Heterandria kolbrookii, Ag. (MS.) collected by ourselves 

 in Charleston, S. C, prove to be identical with the latter. 



The largest female specimen which has come under our observation, mea- 

 sures two inches in total length, in which the head enters four times and a 

 half, and the caudal fin six and a half times. The head itself is very much 

 depressed and sloping towards the snout, giving the latter a wedge-shaped ap- 

 pearance, a trait not altogether peculiar to the species of this genus, for we 

 observe it in Pacilia, Limia, Girardinus, and to a certain degree in Fundulus 

 and Hydrargyra. The eye is very large, subcircular ; its diameter entering but 

 three times and a half in the length of the side of the head. The body is sub- 

 fusiform in profile when not otherwise distorted by the presence of ova or 

 embryos in the abdomen. The origin of the dorsal fin is much nearer the 

 extremity of the caudal than the tip of the snout ; the fin itself being 

 higher than long. The anal fin is larger than the dorsal, deeper than long, 

 exteriorly subtruncated, its anterior margin being nearly equidistant between 

 the tip of the snout and the extremity of the caudal fin. The ventrals are 

 small, short and broad when expanded ; their tips extending as far as the 

 vent when the belly is not otherwise distended. The pectoral fins are rather 

 large, projecting beyond the insertion of the ventrals when in their natural 

 condition. The formula of the fins is as follows : D8; A 9 ; C 4, 1, 6 6 1 

 5 ; V 6 ; PI, 10. 



The largest male specimen which we have examined, measures about an 

 inch and a quarter. The body is quite slender, and fusiform in profile, the 

 head holding the same proportions towards the total length as in the female

sex. The origin of the dorsal fin is nearly equidistant between either extremi- 

 ties, whilst that of the anal is equidistant between the apes of the snout and 

 the insertion of the caudal fin. The ventrals hold the same position towards 

 the anal as in the female sex. The pectorals are proportionately longer. 

 The fins exhibit the same number of rays as in the female ; the anal differs in 

 its structure, inasmuch as the second and third rays are much stouter and 

 more elongated than the rest. 



The scales are well developed, deeper than long, posteriorly rounded off, an- 

 teriorly truncated, with radiating furrows upon the latter section alone. The 

 color is uniform olivaceous brown, lighter beneath than above ; the dorsal 

 and caudal fins exhibiting transverse blackish lines. 



Gambusia holbrooki is very abundant in ponds and ditches of fresh water of 

 South Carolina, and as already stated, was also collected in Florida. Speci- 

 mens from the latter locality are somewhat larger than those from South 

 Carolina. 



XII. The smallest fish so far known to inhabit fresh waters is Eeterandria 

 formosa, Ag. (MS.), which is found associated with the preceding species, in 

 South Carolina, where we have observed it ourselves, as well as in Florida, 

 whence Mr. Glover has brought specimens. When full grown the female 

 measures about an inch in total length, and the male six-eighths of an inch ; 

 the specimens from Florida being somewhat larger than those from South 

 Carolina. 



The body is compressed and fusiform in profile ; the head constituting a 

 little less than the fourth of the entire length. The snout is very short and 

 rounded off, the mouth quite protractile, with the lower jaw slightly project- 

 ing beyond the upper one. The eyes are very large and subcircular ; their 

 horizontal diameter entering about twice and a halt time or at most thrice in 

 the length of the side of the head. The dorsal fin is higher than long ; its an- 

 terior margin being nearly equidistant between the apex of the snout and the 

 extremity of the caudal fin. The anal is deeper than long, and somewhat 

 smaller than the dorsal. The ventrals are very small, short and broad, ex- 

 tending as far as the vent. The pectorals are elongated and project beyond 

 the origin of the ventrals. The fins in the male sex resemble those of the 

 female just alluded to, except the anal which is inserted more anteriorly, its 

 second and third rays being much more developed than the rest, thus giving 

 that an appendage-like appearance- The scales are comparatively very 

 large ; seven longitudinal series only being observed across the flanks of the 

 female sex. They are deeper than long, and furrowed upon their anterior sec- 

 tion alone. The ground color is olivaceous, or else yellowish brown above ; 

 the belly being of a light lemon tint. A black streak extends from the snout 

 along the middle of the flanks to the insertion of the caudal fin. From six to 

 eight brownish black vertical streaks may be observed along the sides inter- 

 secting the lateral streak, thus subdividing the surface of the body into quad- 

 rangular areas. A jet black spot exists at the base of the caudal fin, also at 

 the anterior margin of the dorsal and anal, except in the male sex in which the 

 latter fin is of a uniform yellowish tint. The caudal, ventrals and pectorals 

 are olivaceous and unicolor in either sex. 



The species thus briefly described, belongs to the genus Girardinus of Prof. 

 Poey. It is characterized by a protractile, rounded, and scarcely cleft month, 

 the lower jaw projecting somewhat beyond the upper one. There is but one 

 series of teeth which are approximated, moveable, slender at their base and 

 extremely acute. The anterior margin of the anal is situated somewhat in 

 advance of the dorsal, and varying in structure according to the sexes. The 

 caudal is rounded as usual. The branchiostegal rays are five on either side, 

 and the branchial orifices continuous under the throat. The intestine is slen- 

 der, elongated, convoluted, and the liver small.*

NATURAL SCIENCESOF PHILADELPHIA. 63 



Girardinus formosus, is quite as common in ponds and ditches, as the species 

 treated of in the preceding paragraph, especially about the rice fields and 

 inlets of rivers and brooks. Their great abundance has brought them to the 

 notice of every planter at the South, where these fishes are met with. 



XIII. A "blind fish, taken from a well near Bowling Green, Ky.," was 

 recently sent to the Smithsonian Institution by J. E. Younglove, Esq. 



In its general appearance and chief structural traits it resembles that which 

 occurs in Mammoth cave, with this curious difference, that the ventral fins are 

 wanting : we will call it Typhlichthys subterraneus. 



Some years ago a fish ( Chologaster cornutus) was found in the ditches of the 

 rice fields of South Carolina, in all appearances akin to Amb ly op sis spelceus, hav- 

 ing the same advanced position of the vent, the body being covered with simi- 

 lar scales, but the ventral fins are wanting and the eyes fully developed.* 



We have not yet been informed of the nature of the dentition of Chologaster 

 cornutus. That of Typhlichthys subterraneus is similar to the dentition of Ambly- 

 opsis spelceus, and consisting of narrow patches of acute and very minute teeth 

 upon the premasillar bones, the palatines and the lower jaw. 



These three genera have for common traits of structure : a body covered by 

 cycloid scales, a dorsal and an anal fin opposed to one another, a rounded off, 

 or sublanceolated caudal fin, the position of the vent anterior to the base of 

 the pectoral fins. The shape of the mouth and the dentition are in all proba- 

 bilities alike. The generical characters consist : in Amblyopsis, the want of 

 eyes and the presence of ventral fins ; in Typhlichthys, the want of eyes and 

 ventral fins, both, and in Chologaster, the presence' of eyes and the want of ven- 

 tral fins. 



The propriety of establishing three genera upon characters apparently tran- 

 sitory may be questioned by those who believe in the doctrine of transforma- 

 tions. Were Chologaster provided with ventral fins, and to differ from Amblyop- 

 sis by the presence of well developed eyes alone, the plausibility of a trans- 

 formation of that organ according to circumstances might seduce many. But 

 then again comes Typhlichthys, which holds an intermediate position, perfectly 

 eyeless and deprived also of ventral fins. 



The largest specimens which we have seen of Typhlichthys subterraneus 

 measure a little over one and a half inch. The head which enters about three 

 times and a half in that length, is depressed, and broader than deep. The 

 mouth is proportionally large and transverse, the lower jaw being somewhat 

 longer than the upper. Minute and acerated teeth may be observed upon the 

 lower jaw, the premaxillar bones, and on the palatines also, disposed upon 

 narrow patches. The eyes exhibit no visible traces of their presence, the orbit 

 being filled up by a muscular tissue. The branchial apertures are separated 

 under the throat by a narrow isthmus, the branchiostegal rays being six in 

 number on either side. The body anterior to the dorsal and anal fins is sub- 

 cylindrical, whilst it is compressed and tapering posteriorly ; its entire profile 

 being subfusiform. The vent is situated in advance of the pectoral fins and 

 close to the branchial isthmus. The height of the dorsal fin is greater than 

 its base ; its anterior margin is nearer the extremity of the caudal fin than the 

 apex of the snout. The caudal is rounded oft' posteriorly or sublanceolated, 

 the central rays being the longest. The anal fin is inserted nea.rly opposite the 

 dorsal, or else somewhat more posteriorly ; it is likewise deeper than long. 

 The centrals, as alluded to above, are entirely wanting. The pectorals are 

 slender and elongated ; their middle rays being the most developed. The 

 number of the rays in the various fins is as follows : D 7 ; A 8 ; C 4, 1, 6, 6, 

 1, 5 ; V ; P 11 ; a formula very similar to that of Amblyopsis spelceus. The 

 scales are very small, subimbricated, firmly adhering to the skin without 

 being imbedded in it as in the species just alluded to. They are rather

deeper than long, rounded off, broader anteriorly than posteriorly, exhibiting 

 distant concentric lines of growth and very wide radiating furrows which 

 affect the anterior portion of the scale only. The head is scaleless, but its 

 upper surface as well as its sides, exhibit transverse cutaneous, finely granu- 

 lar ridges. A few of the latter may be observed along the flanks, over the 

 scales, although much less conspicuous than on the head. The color is a 

 uniform dull yellowish white tint. 



XIV. The "sun fish," which we have formerly described under the name 

 of Promotis obesus, * belongs now to the genus Bryttus, as characterized in our 

 Report upon the Fishes of the U. S. P. R. R. Explorations and Surveys. Its sys- 

 tematic name, therefore, will be henceforwards Bryttus obesus. 



XV. While assorting some of the fishes which the Smithsonian Institution 

 had been receiving during the past years, a specimen of the genus Megalops 

 was found in one of the kegs sent from the Tortugas, Garden Key, Fla., by 

 Lieut. H. G. Wright. It belongs to the same species as that which we have 

 formerly described under the name of M. elongatus. 



It is three feet and three inches long, regularly subfusiform in its profile 

 the head constituting the fifth of the total length. The greatest depth, which 

 is seven inches, corresponds to the anterior portion of the body, nearly mid- 

 way between the pectoral and the ventral fins. The posterior extremity of 

 the maxillar bone extends considerably beyond a vertical line which would 

 intercept the hind rim of the orbit. The eyes are subcircular, their diameter 

 entering five times in the length of the side of the head. 



The anterior or external ray of all the fins is very stout, considerably stouter 

 than the other rays, and usually the longest also. By anterior or external 

 ray is understood that which begins the series of developed rays, and not the 

 rudiments of rays that occur at the anterior or external margin of the fins. 

 The pectoral fins are lanceolated, but their extremity does not extend as far as 

 the origin of the ventrals. The latter are inserted altogether in advance of 

 the dorsal, so that when expanded, their posterior edge, which is linear, will 

 meet a vertical line dropped from the origin of the dorsal. The caudal is 

 deeply furcated and somewhat shorter than the head. The anal is longer than 

 deep, exteriorly concave or crescentic, the posterior rays extending further 

 back than the posterior, very elongated ray, of the dorsal fin. The latter is 

 much higher than long, somewhat concave upon its upper margin. There 

 are ten longitudinal series of scales between the dorsal and the ventral fins. 

 The total number of scales upon a girdle encircling the body in advance of the 

 insertion of the ventrals being also its greatest depth is twenty two, ten on 

 either side, and two odd series, a dorsal and an abdominal series. Small scales 

 may be observed upon the anal and caudal fins to near the extremities of their 

 rays. The numbers of the rays in the various fins correspond to those already 

 given ; we need but to state that those of the caudal may thus be expressed : 

 C 4, 1, 9, 9, 1, 3, giving twenty developed rays and nine, perhaps more, rudi- 

 mentary ones. 



XVI- The brooks and streams which mingle their waters with that 

 of the Potomac river have furnished us with a representative of the Ethe- 

 ostomid family, of an apparently new generic type, the characters of which 

 may be thus expressed : body subfusiform ; head subconical ; snout rather 

 blunt, the upper jaw protruding beyond the lower one, thus giving the mouth 

 an inferior position. The latter is of moderate size, its gape nearly horizontal, 

 surrounded with conspicuous lips. Opercular apparatus scaly, cheeks and 

 throat bare. Dorsal fins distinct ; first dorsal lower than the second, and longer 

 than high. Anal smaller than the second dorsal. Caudal fin posteriorly trun- 

 cated or subtruncated. The genus we will call Arlina.

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 65 



The largest specimens which we have, so far observed, measure about two 

 inches in total length, the body tapering gradually away towards the insertion 

 of the caudal fin. The head, which constitutes the fifth of the entire length, 

 is subcorneal in general appearance, the snout being declivous and blunt and 

 overhangs the lower jaw. The anterior nostril is nearer the eye than the 

 margin of the upper jaw. The eye, itself, is large and subcircular, approxi- 

 mating the upper surface of the head ; its diameter enters nearly four times 

 in the length of the side of the head, twice behind its posterior rim and once 

 in advance of its anterior rim. The posterior extremity of the maxillar bone 

 corresponds to a vertical line drawn at the anterior rim of the orbit. The first 

 dorsal is convex in its outline, it is separated from the second by an appreci- 

 ciable space. The second dorsal, which is higher than the first, is longer than 

 high, its upper margin being subconvex anteriorly and nearly straight poste- 

 riorly. The caudal fin constitutes about the fifth of the total length. The 

 anal is longer than deep and nearly of equal depth throughout ; the vent, 

 which is placed close to its anterior margin, is opposite the origin of the second 

 dorsal. The insertion of the ventrals takes place in advance of the anterior 

 margin of the first dorsal ; they are slender and elongated, but their extremi- 

 ties are far from reaching the vent. The ventrals are well developed, posteri- 

 orly rounded, and project somewhat beyong the ventrals, being even with a 

 vertical line drawn at the terminus of the first dorsal fin. The formula of the 

 rays is as follows : D ix ; 14 ; A 10 ; C 4, 1, 7, 6, 1, 5 ; V i 5 ; P 13. The 

 ground color is yellowish with a triple series of blackish blotches, one along 

 the back, and one on either side immediately beneath the lateral line, which 

 runs along the sixth series of scales, counted from above. During life, 

 the intervening space between the lateral blotches is of a metallic green as 

 well as the cheeks. A black spot may also be observed upon the opercular 

 apparatus. A vertical black streak beneath the eye, and one on either side of 

 the snout. The dorsals, the caudal and pectorals are transversely barred with 

 black ; the anal and pectorals being unicolor. 



We propose calling this little fish Arlina effulgens in allusion to its bright 

 color during life. 



XVII. The Potomac river, in the neighborhood of Washington, has furnished 

 us with another representative of the Etheostomid family, of which constitutes 

 likewise a new generic type, related to Hadropterus and Hyostoma. It differs 

 from Hadropterus by the anal fin, which is smaller than the second dorsal, and 

 from Hyostoma by the contiguity of the dorsal fins. It is also allied to Boleo- 

 soma, from which it may be distinguished by a scaly throat and a truncated 

 caudal. The natural characters of this genus, to which we give the name of 

 Estrella, may be thus resumed. Body subfusiform and compressed. Head 

 subcorneal, well developed, rather blunt. Mouth of moderate size, somewhat 

 protractile, with its gape horizontal ; lower jaw shorter than the upper. Oper- 

 cular apparatus, cheeks and throat scaly. First dorsal fin nearly as high as 

 the second and contiguous to it. Anal smaller than the second dorsal. Cau- 

 dal fin truncated. 



The species is not uncommon, the largest specimens which we have ob- 

 served, measure about three inches and a quarter. The head forms a fifth of 

 the total length. The nape and occipital region constitutes an inclined plane 

 trom the orbits to the origin of the first dorsal fin. The eyes are very large, 

 fubelliptical in shape ; their horizontal diameter entering about three times in 

 she length of the sides of the head ; less than once in advance to the anterior 

 rim of the orbit. The posterior extremity of the maxillar bone extending as 

 far as a vertical line drawn in advance of the pupil. 



The first dorsal fin is much longer than high, superiorly convex, its mem- 

 brane being contiguous to the second dorsal. The latter is likewise longer 

 than high, but it is higher anteriorly than posteriorly, thus the upper margin 

 of that fin, which is subconvex or nearly linear, is nevertheless declivous

66 PROCEEDINGS OE THE ACADEMY OF 



backwards. The anal fin is longer than deep, convex upon its edge ; its an- 

 terior margin being placed somewhat behind a vertical line drawn at the an- 

 terior margin of the second dorsal, but the same line intersects the vent. The 

 caudal fin, which is a little shorter than the head, is truncated upon its pos- 

 terior margin. The ventrals are of moderate development compared to the 

 other fin, their middle rays being the longest ; these fins assume a spear- 

 shaped appearance in the state of rest. Their extremities are far from reach- 

 ing the vent. The pectorals, much larger than the ventrals, assume the same 

 shape as the ventrals, under similar circumstances, but when expanded, their 

 posterior margin is quite convex. Their extremities project beyond those of 

 the ventrals, although they do not reach a vertical line intersecting the vent. 

 The rays of the fins are : B ix ; 15+1 ; A 11 ; C 10, 1, 7, 7, 1, 9 ; V 1, 5 ; P 

 13. The scales are of moderate size, deeper than long, anteriorly truncated 

 and posteriorly rounded, exhibiting radiating furrows upon their anterior sec- 

 tion, and numerous, slender, needle-like pectinations upon their posterior 

 margin. The lateral line constitutes the seventh series of scales, counted from 

 the second dorsal fin. 



The ground color is yellowish brown, the dorsal region being maculated with 

 blackish brown, whilst the ventral region is unicolor. A series of large 

 blotches may be observed along the dorsal line affecting both sides of the back, 

 and a series of smaller blotches along the lateral line. There is also a black 

 streak on either side of the snout, and a vertical one beneath the eye. The 

 caudal and pectorals are transversally barred with black, the dorsals irregu- 

 larly vermiculated, giving these fins a checkered appearance. The first dorsal 

 is moreover provided with a jet black spot upon its anterior edge, between the 

 first and second rays. The anal and ventrals are blackish, the tint being 

 lighter at the base of these fins than towards their periphery. 



The black spot at the anterior margin of the first dorsal fin, has suggested 

 the specific name of E. atromaculata, by which we propose to designate this 

 fish. 



XVIII. A third, and much larger species of Etheostomid occurs in the waters 

 of the Potomac river. It is identical with the one from the Susquehanna river, 

 described by Prof. Haldeman under the name of Percina nebulosa. * 



XIX. Etheostoma caprodes of Rafinesque, is very closely allied to Percina 

 vebulosa, so closely, indeed, that we are not yet prepared to point out the dif- 

 ferences with a sufficient degree of accuracy. But whatever it may be Etheos- 

 toma caprodes must be referred to the genus Percina of Haldeman, as having 

 priority over that of Pileoma of BeKay. Both of these genera were published 

 in 1842, but since Percina is quoted by BeKay, | it evidently shows that it was 

 issued from the press before Pileoma. That the genus Percina, as first con- 

 stituted, contained heterogeneous species, is no ground for rejecting it alto- 

 gether, and the species first enumerated must be considered as its type. 



XX. Hence, should Pileoma semifasciatam prove specifically distinct from 

 Percina nebvlosa, it will be the third species of the genus Percina under the 

 name of Percina semifasciata. 



XXI. The Etheostomid from Lake Superior, described as Pileoma zebra, is to 

 be a fourth species of Percina under the appellation of Percina zebra. 



XXII. Finally a fifth species of the genus Percina was described by us in the 

 " Ichthyology of the U. S. and Mexican Boundary Survey," under the name

of Pileoma carbonaria which is to be designated henceforwards under that of 

 Percina carbonaria. 



XXIII. We propose now to characterize a new genus of Etheostomid under 

 the name of Oligocephalus, as follows : Head small and subconical ; mouth 

 terminal, of moderate size, not protractile ; jaw equal and provided with slen- 

 der, acerated and conspicuous teeth, disposed upon multiple series, the exter- 

 nal series much largerthan the inner series. Opercular apparatus, cheeks and 

 throat scaleless. First dorsal fin lower than the second, longer or nearly of the 

 same length, and contiguous. Anal much smaller than the second dorsal, and 

 provided anteriorly with two small spiny rays. The external ray of the ven- 

 tral fins is likewise a small spine. Caudal, posteriorly rounded off or else 

 convex. To this genus we now refer PacUichthys lepidus figured in the Report 

 of the U. S. and Mex. Boundary Commission. The first dorsal is represented 

 as being widely separated from the second, whilst in fact, its membrane 

 reaches the anterior margin of the latter fin. We shall therefore record it in 

 future under the name of Oligocephalus lepidus. 



XXIV. A species allied to the preceding one, inhabits the hydrographic 

 basin of James river, Va. It reaches nearly the same size, that is about two 

 inches long. Its boly is quite compressed, subfusiform in profile, maintain- 

 ing its depth towards the insertion of the caudal fin. The head enters nearly 

 four times and a half in the total length. The gape of the mouth is slightly 

 oblique ; the posterior extremity of the maxillar bone corresponding to a ver- 

 tical line drawn in advance of the pupil. The diameter of the eye enters 

 about four times in the length of the side of the head. The base of the second 

 dorsal fin is nearly equal to that of the first. The base of the anal fin is 

 nearly equal to its deepest rays. The ventrals are lanceolate in shape ; 

 whilst the pectorals are subelliptical in their outline, their extremities project- 

 ing beyond those of the ventrals. The formula of the fins is as follow : D vn ; 

 13 ; A ii, 7; C 6, 1, 6, 7, 1, 5 ; V i, 5 ; P 13. The scales are rather _ small, 

 somewhat deeper than long, finely pectinated posteriorly, with radiating fur- 

 row at the anterior section only. The lateral line constitutes the eighth series 

 of scales, counted from the second dorsal fin. The ground color is reddish 

 brown, transversely maculated with blackish spots. The second dorsal fin and 

 the caudal are transversely barred with black upon a light olivaceous ground. 

 The first dorsal, the anal, the ventrals, and the pectorals are of a uniform 

 light olive tint. A jet black spot may be observed immediately above the 

 insertion of the pectorals close to the thoracic arch, and has suggested the 

 name of Oligocephalus humeralis, by which we propose to designate this species. 



XXV. The species fromWalcott, Wayne Co..N. Y. described by my friend, 

 Dr. H. R. Storer, under the name of Etheostoma linsleyi* belongs to the genus 

 Oligocephalus, as characterized above. I have in my possession authentic spe- 

 cimens of the same. It is a much slenderer fish than the two foregoing species, 

 anil like 0. humeralis, is provided with a black spot above the pectoral fins, 

 close to the thoracic belt. A careful description of it having been given by its 

 author, we need simply refer to it for the present. We have recorded it under 

 the appellation of Oligocephalus linslii, in the monograph we prepare upon that 

 family of our fresh water fishes. 



XXVI. Amongst the fishes collected by Major B. Alvord, at Fort Gratiot, 

 Lake Huron, there is a species of Etheostomid, the generic characters of which 

 remind us somewhat of those given to the genus Hadropterus. The opercle and 

 cheeks, however, are scaleless, as well as the throat, which is minutely prickly. 

 The first dorsal fin is longer and lower than the second, which is equal to the

68 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



anal. The caudal is emarginated posteriorly. The species itself being yet un- 

 described, we shall call it Alvordius ?naculatus. The specimens before us mea- 

 sure two inches and three quarters. The body is elongated, rather slender and 

 subfusiform. The head is subcorneal, entering about four times and a half in 

 the total length. The eye is well developed ; its diameter being contained 

 four times in the length of the side of the head ; once in advance of its anterior 

 rim. The posterior extremity of the maxillar bone extends to a vertical line 

 drawn within the anterior rim of the orbit, not quite in front of the pupil. The 

 lower jaw is somewhat shorter than the upper. The first dorsal fin is much 

 longer and lower than the second, to which it is nearly contiguous. Its upper 

 margin is convex. The second dorsal is longer than high, diminishing gradu- 

 ally backwards. The caudal, which forms about the sixth of the total length, 

 is somewhat emarginated posteriorly. The anal is placed opposite the second 

 dorsal, and nearly equal to it in size and shape. The ventrals are sublanceo- 

 lated and rather short ; their posterior extremities being even with those of 

 the pectorals, which are subelliptical in their outline. The formula of the fins, 

 reads . D xiv ; 13 ; A i, 10 ; C 5, 1, 7, 6, 1, 8 ; V i, 5 ; P 14. The scales are 

 rather small, deeper than long, anteriorly subtruncated, posteriorly rounded, 

 with radiating furrows upon the anterior section only, and fine pectination upon 

 the posterior margin. A series of larger scales conspicuously toothed pos- 

 teriorly, may be observed along the ventral line between the vent and the 

 extremities of the ventrals. The ground color is reddish brown, the dorsal 

 region being tessellated with blackish spots, whilst a series of black patches 

 may be observed on either side, larger and less numerous in the male than 

 in the female. A black streak intersects vertically the eye. The fins in 

 the male are unicolor, except the first dorsal, which is black, spotted at the 

 base. In the female sex, the caudal exhibits transverse blackish lines. The 

 inferior regions are unicolor in either sex. 



XXVII. In 1S52, E. O. Dayton, Esq., sent to the Smithsonian Institution, 

 amongst other fishes, a species of Etheostomid, which we referred at that time 

 to an undescribed genus. Subsequently, the genus Catonotus was published, 

 answering to it. The species being still unknown, we propose to call it C. 

 fasciatus. The specimens are a little short of three inches, the head entering 

 about four times and a half in the total length. The gape of the mouth is 

 oblique, the posterior extremity of the maxillar bone reaching a vertical line 

 drawn immediately in front of the pupil. The diameter of the eye enters five 

 times in the length of the side of the head. The first dorsal is very low and 

 equal in length to the second, which is superiorly convex, and as high posteri- 

 orly as anteriorly, the tip of the posterior rays extending almost to the in- 

 sertion of the caudal. The anal fin is much smaller than the second dorsal, 

 and longer than deep. The caudal is rounded off. The ventrals are rather 

 small and subovate, whilst the pectorals are subelliptical, and extend further 

 back than the ventrals, either of which being very far from attaining the vent. 

 The formula of the fins is : D vm ; 15 ; A n, 8 ; C 4, 1, 7, 6, 1, 4 ; V 1, 5 ; 

 P 13. The scales are small, subcircular, rather deeper than long, minutely 

 and inconspicuously pectinated upon their posterior margin, with radiating 

 furrows upon their anterior section alone. The lateral, which is nearer the 

 back than the belly becomes obsolete from the origin of the second dorsal back- 

 wards. The ground color is chestnut brown, with irregular blackish fascia? 

 across the dorsal region and upper portion of the flanks ; the inferior regions are 

 of a lighter tint than the back, and unicolor. The second dorsal and the caudal 

 are transversally barred with black upon a yellowish ground. The other fins 

 are uniform whitish yellow, except the first dorsal which is greyish. A vertical 

 black streak may be seen beneath the orbit.

Catalogue of the Coleoptera of Fort Tejon, California. 

 BY JOHN L. LECONTE, M. D. 



The present paper contains a list of the species of Coleoptera collected at Fort 

 Tejon, during 1857 and 1858, by the indefatigable naturalist, Mr. John Xantus, 

 (de Vesey), which were found to be remarkable in many respects. The number 

 of species obtained (147) is very small for the time during which they were 

 collected, and the proportion of new species (52) is very large. These facts are 

 in accordance with the general principles of the geographical distribution of or- 

 ganized beings in Pacific North America, stated by me at the meeting of the Ame- 

 rican Association for the Advancement of Science, held at Albany in 1851 . Several 

 genera not previously known to science are herein described, one of which, 

 Aplastus, completes beautifully the series between normal Elateridse and Cebrio, 

 previously indicated by Plastocerus and Euthysanius. A large and singular 

 species of Hetaerius was also found. Important is the fact that the species 

 formerly referred by me to Malachius, are to be separated therefrom, as it 

 diminishes the small number of exceptions to the principle announced by me, 

 that no genus was common to Europe and Pacific America, without being re- 

 presented in Atlantic America. 



I have not included some Staphylinidse in the collection, which, with the 

 exception of a small Isomalus, were previously found by me in other parts of 

 California, hoping at a future time to bring them with a vast number of other new 

 species of that family into a monograph. Two species of Curculionidffiare also 

 omitted, for the reason that it will involve more labor to determine the genera to 

 which they belong, than I can properly devote to the subject at present. 



1. Onius calif ornicus. A male of this species from Fort Tejon differs 

 from those found at San Francisco, by the thorax being much rounded on the 

 sides, especially before the middle. Judging from analogy of distribution of 

 other insects in California, this would indicate a difference of a specific nature. 

 Should the occurrence of other similar specimens warrant this conclusion, the 

 name 0. X a n t i would be appropriate. 



2. Cyclmxs punctatus, ater capite thoraceque opacis alutaceis, hoc 

 latitudine haud breviore, postice angustato lateribus marginatis, rotundatis 

 postice sinuatis, ante basin transversim profunde impresso, elytris striis grosse 

 punctatis, ventricosis, convexis, postice acutis. Long. *60 *68. 



Abundant at Fort Tejon. Allied to C. ventricosus and others, but differs by 

 the thorax being more gradually narrowed behind, and not suddenly constrict- 

 ed; as also by the sculpture. 



3. Cychrus striatus, ater, capite thoraceque subopacis, alutaceis, hoc 

 latitudine longiore, postice angustato, lateribus marginatis, rotundatis postice 

 sinuatis, ante basin transversim profunde impresso, elytris ovalibus convexis, 

 postice acutis, striis profunde punctatis. Long. 62. 



One male, Fort Tejon. Related to the preceding ; but the thorax is longer, 

 more sinuate on the sides behind, so that they become parallel, but still with- 

 out being constricted. The elytra are narrower and less ventricose, the strise 

 are deeper and the punctures smaller.

Fort Tejon. Varies much in size and color, being sometimes fuscous, some- 

 times entirely pale testaceous : the usual variety has dark elytra and pale head 

 and thorax. It differs from the types of the genus in having the antennae 

 very slightly thickened from the 3rd to the 9th joint, the 10th and 11th are 

 thicker and longer than the 9th; the latter in the male is about twice the size 

 of the 8th, in the female but little larger. The effect of this is to cause the 

 antennie to be only moderately clavate, instead of capitulate. This taken in 

 connection with the more dense pubescence and punctuation, and less convex 

 body would seem to indicate the propriety of separating this as a distinct 

 genus, but before a general study is made of our species of the family of 

 Nitidulidse the attempt to define it would be premature. As in other species 

 of the genus, the antennal grooves are entirely wanting. 



22. Carpophilus pallipennis (Jioralis Er.). Found also in the Rio 

 Grande valley. 



23. Carpophilus caudalis, elongatus, depressus, piceus nitidus, subtiliter 

 pubescens, thorace brevi, lateribus rotundatis marginatis, sat dense punctato, 

 elytris thorace duplo longioribus, fortius marginatis, punctulatis, macula

Two females ; one from Tejon, the other from Nebraska. Precisely resem- 

 bles in color and sculpture C. discoideus Lee, (Proc. Acad. 185S, 62), 

 but differs by the abdomen being much longer, and having three segments ex- 

 posed. The latter was, however, described from a single male, and future ex- 

 amination may show that they are sexes of one species. 



24. Nitidula humeralis, longiuscula, subconvexa, fusca, pubescens, 

 thorace latitudine duplo breviore, lateribus late rotundatis, ciliatis, elytris 

 nigricantibus, margine apicali et laterali angusto, strigisque tribus basalibus

One specimen, Tejon. Related to N. zi c z ac , but is longer and more con- 

 vex with the sides of the thorax less rounded, and with no medial angulated 

 spot on the elytra : the three spots at the base are connected, and there is be- 

 sides a slight submarginal spot near the middle. As in that species the 

 middle and posterior tarsi are very feebly dilated. 



25. Temnochila chlorodia. . 



26. Hister sexstriatus Lee. Found also at San Francisco. 



27. Hister remotus, oblongus niger nitidus, parum convexus, thorace

One specimen, Tejon. In this the most remarkable, as well as the largest 

 species of the genus, the front is slightly concave, with a raised margin, and 

 the tibia? are suddenly dilated and denticulate as in the others. The sides 

 of the thorax are parallel from the base nearly to the apex, where they are 

 suddenly obtusely angulated, and run to the anterior angles which are round 

 ed : the incision near the base cuts across the incrassated side, leaving the 

 posterior part a small quadrate elevated plate, the anterior portion larger, sub- 

 triangular with truncate angles, flat, opaque and densely pubescent.

One female, Tejon. A small species, differing from the others in my collec- 

 tion by the more coarse and dense punctuation of the thorax : the head is 

 punctured like the thorax and the antennae are entirely black. 



36. Anthrenus 1 e p i d u s . 



37. Serica fimbriata. 



38. Hoplia callipyge. This may be a favorable opportunity to observe 

 that recent observation has shown that H. tristis Mels. is the male of H. 

 trifasciata Say (primoria Burin.), a fact that could never have been infer- 

 red from the appearance of the two supposed species. 



39. Pleocoma fimbriata. Some fragments of this insect, found in the 

 stomach of a woodpecker at Tejon, enable me to investigate the oral organs. 



The clypeus at its inferior margin is emarginate for the insertion of a 

 pyramidal hairy corneous labrum : the mandibles are short, pyramidal acute, 

 with a few hairs near the apex. The maxillae are large at the base, with the 

 lobes very small, the outer one not reaching beyond the first joint of the palpi, 

 penicillate with long hair, the inner one much smaller, narrow and pointed ; 

 palpi slender, first joint short, 2d long, 3d one-half shorter than 2d, 4th a 

 little longer than 3d. Mentum broadly rounded in front ; ligula almost semi- 

 circular, palpi inserted on the upper face of the ligula, bases contiguous, with 

 intermediate pencil of hairs, 3d joint longer than 2d, and the latter longer than 

 the first. It will thus be seen that combined with the 11-jointed antenna? 

 with polyphyllous club, the characters above detailed are abundantly sufficient 

 to establish this genus as a new group, related to Geotrupida? and Copridse, 

 wrth, however, strong tendency towards the Dynastide group of Scarab.

Tejon, abundant. Front moderately concave, hairy : the sides of the thorax 

 are less rounded than in A. expansa, the punctures are strongly marked, 

 and there are besides fine elevated lines, having a general longitudinal direc- 

 tion, connected together forming elongate meshes. In some specimens the disc 

 of the thorax is darker than the sides. It is, perhaps, A. ten e ogas t e r Lap. 

 and Gory ; the description given by them contains no definite character by 

 which to separate it from allied species.

 is much more densely punctured and without lustre. The hair on the head

Has the appearance of an elongate Corymbites, (e. g. C. appressifrons) but 

 is closely allied to Plastocerus and Euthysanius, from which it differs essen- 

 tially only by the antennae being elongate and serrate.

Several specimens from Tejon. The antennae extend considerably beyond 

 the base of the thorax, and being of the same length, or nearly so, in all the 

 specimens, I infer that they are all males. 



This genus most perfectly completes the line of genera from the aberrant 

 Elaters like Campylus, through Plastocerus and Euthysanius to Cebrio. This 

 resembles the Elaters, and Exithysanius the Cebrios. An interesting fact, 

 though not without parallel in other families and classes of animals, is that 

 these transition forms should all occur in one Zoological region. 



52. Plastocerus fr at e r . Under this name I would characterize a species 

 very closely related in form and sculpture to P. Schaumii, but differing by 

 the thorax being broader and considerably rounded on the sides. The female 

 is of the same form as the male, but with the elytra slightly narrowed towards 

 the tip ; the wings are perfect. The antennae of the female are short and 

 serrate. The specimens are in the collection of Mr. Henry Ulke, and I have 

 not access to them at this present moment, but will on a future occasion 

 make a full description of them. I will add, in passing, that the sexual 

 characters given by me (Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. 10, 502,) are erroneously 

 founded. 



53. Euthysanius 1 a u t u s . Several males and one female were procured 

 at Tejon. The latter is one of the most remarkable forms yet found and indi- 

 cates the close relation between this genus and the Cebrionidae. The head and

thorax are as in the male: the antennas are longer than the head, 

 12-jointed, the inner angle of the 6th and 7th slightly prominent, of 

 the 8th 11th joints gradually more prolonged into a short ramus : the ramus 

 of the 11th almost equal to the 12th joint. Elytra covering only the first seg- 

 ment of the abdomen, diverging at the suture behind, and obliquely truneated 

 with the outer angle broadly rounded. Abdomen very long, cylindrical, with 

 seven ventral segments and a large anal plate, first segment very short. Feet 

 entirely as in the male. Length, 1"45.

One specimen, Tejon. At first view, resembles P. cavicollis Lee, from 

 San Diego, but the head is more finely punctured, the thorax is comparatively 

 wider, finely punctulate, not deeply excavated in the middle for its whole 

 length, as in that species, and the elytra are more finely punctured : the ante- 

 rior angles of the thorax are rounded, while in P. cavicollis, they are obliquely 

 and broadly truncate. The ungues as in that species are broadly toothed at 

 the base.

 elongatum. 



A genus composed of Malachius longiceps Lee, (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. 

 6, 165,) and the one described below. It differs remarkably from the other 

 genera, by the antenna? being frontal, inserted before the eyes, but not near 

 the clypeal suture, which from the length of the head is thus much farther 

 from the eyes than usual. The clypeus is membranous at apex, corneous at 

 base in the type, but in the other is entirely membranous. This would seem 

 to indicate that they were to be regarded as of different genera, but the form, 

 sculpture and coloration, as well as the length of head and position of antennae 

 are so perfectly similar in both species, that it would be very unnatural to 

 separate them. Regarding the genus as the transition form from Malachius 

 with frontal antenna? and corneous clypeus to Anthocomus with the antenna? 

 lateral and clypeus membranous, it will be clear that the clypeus might be 

 variable in structure, provided other characters be impressed sufficient to dis- 

 tinguish the group as of generic value. We will then have two groups : 1. T. 

 longiceps, with the clypeus partly corneous and the abdomen simple. 

 2. T. abdominalis, with the clypeus entirely membranous and the last three 

 segments of the abdomen with deep reniform excavations, the last one having 

 in addition a small cup like medial fovea.

 mine whether the curious excavations of the abdomen are sexual or specific in 

 value.

A genus also intermediate between Malacbius and Anthocomus, agreeing 

 with "the first in the position of the antennae, with the second by the membran- 

 ous clypeus. Besides the species here described, I refer to this genus Malacbius 

 auritus Lee, (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. 6, 165,) which differs by the antennae 

 being serrate in both sexes and by the ventral segments of the abdomen being 

 corneous. In the species here made known, all the segments except the last 

 have a wide medial membranous portion.

Tejon. The colors of the two sexes are so different, as to lead to error. In 

 the male the elytra are yellow, impressed and distorted at the apex, with a 

 small cylindrical black sutural prominence, and a wide concave external one, 

 which is margined with black : the posterior thighs and tibiae are yellow, the 

 former with the upper margin black. In the female there is a long common 

 sutural spot confluent each side with one extending nearly the whole length 

 of the margin, forming a very wide band of a greenish color, and the posterior 

 legs are black, with only the knees and apex of the tibia? yellow. The penis 

 of the male is prominent forming a long cylindrical corneous style.

One specimen, Tejon. A very extraordinary species having very much the 

 appearance of a small Trogosita ; the last three joints of the antenna? are a 

 little broader than the preceding. The peculiar sculpture of the thorax, a 

 lateral line remote from the margin, and bending around close to the basal 

 margin, is also found inD. constrictus, but was not previously observed 

 by me on account of the somewhat bad condition of the specimens. It is 

 quite obvious in those collected at Tejon ; in that species, however, the 

 ungues are both furnished with a large appendage as usual.

many other uniques of my collection was lost in a vessel, while being sent to 

 Prof. Lacordaire for examination. A mutilated specimen was brought by Mr. 

 Schott from the Mexican boundary, but the arrival of a fine specimen from 

 Tejon, enables me to study anew the characters, by the aid of Prof. Lacordaire's 

 fourth volume. 



The tarsi are not lobed beneath as formerly described by me : the appearance 

 was produced by the agglutination of hairs. From the absence of lobes, the 

 presence of large appendages to the claws, and the size and obliquity of the 

 middle coxse, the genus must be referred to the same family with Dasytes, 

 though remarkably different from any other described. The eyes are rounded, 

 prominent and coarsely granulate : the last joint of the long maxillary palpi 

 is large and securiform, of the labial palpi triangular ; the posterior tarsi have 

 the first and second joints about equal, the third very slightly shorter, the 

 fourth still shorter. The sixth segment of the abdomen in one specimen is 

 exserted, in the other retracted, so as to be very small. The posterior coxse 

 appear precisely as in the Cleridaa : so that this anomalous genus must be 

 regarded as intimately connecting Dasytes with that family.

 inner anterior tuberosity is also a little prolonged in the same direction. There

131. Saxinis saucia. Three specimens from Tejon differ from more 

 northern specimens by the thorax and elytra being more strongly punctured. 

 Such differences between forms presenting otherwise similar specific character*

Tejon: a specimen from Sacramento was given me by Mr. S. S. Rathvon. 

 Differs from G. hirtus, (Eumolpus hirtus 01. Eu. pini Say,) by the punctures 

 being smaller, by the thorax being narrower and less rounded on the sides 

 and by the hair being of a uniform whitish color. The genus Glyptoscelis 

 (J.Chevr.) is distinguished from the other genera allied to Eumolpus by the 

 mouth not being covered beneath by the prosternum, by the claws being 

 toothed, and by the tibiaj being longitudinally suleate. The head is not sculp- 

 tured as in Heteraspis.

Supplement. 



I have, for the purpose of making these pages a complete record of the addi- 

 tions to our Pacific Coleopterous Fauna, here collected notes and descriptions 

 of species derived from various sources, which have not been mentioned in my 

 Report on the Coleoptera of Pacific North America, for the P. R. R. Expl. of 

 47th Par., or in the Catalogue of Coleoptera found adjacent to the U. S. and Mex. 

 Boundary, printed in the 4th vol. of the second series of the Journal of the 

 Academy. I propose, from time to time, as fresh material is furnished by the 

 kindness of my friends, to give other supplements to the Pacific Coleoptera Fauna 

 of the UnitedStates. 



1. Dromius quadricollis, nigro-piceus, depressus, thoraee latitudine 

 breviore, quadrato, postice subangustato, transversim rugoso, postice profun- 

 dius impresso, lateribus latius marginatis pallidioribus, elytris oblongis. striatis 

 interstitiis parum convexis, subtus piceus. Long. -28. 



Puget Sound, Mr. George Davidson. Very closely allied to D. piceus, but 

 differing chiefly in the form of the thorax: the latter is broader than long, 

 scarcely narrowed behind, with the depressed margin broader, the disc more 

 rugous, the dorsal line deeper, and the posterior transverse impression deeper; 

 the posterior angles are also more regularly rounded, and the elytra are a little 

 broader. 



2. Cymindis abstrusa, picea, pubescens, capite thoraceque fortiter punc- 

 tato, fronte laevi, thoraee latitudine breviore, postice angustato, lateribus rotun-

 tusis, basi late rotundato, linea dorsali profunda, elytris oblongo-ovalibus nitidis, 

 striis antice punctatis, interstitiis planis, confuse subtiliter punctatis, margine 

 pallido, antennis castaneis, abdomine pedibusque piceo-testaceis. Long. -41. 



Washington Territory, Dr. Kennerly. Of the size of C. laticollis, but 

 with the elytra shining, and the thorax more broadly margined : from C. 

 reflexa it differs by its larger size, broader elytra, and less coarsely punc- 

 tured head and thorax ; the latter is also comparatively more narrowed behind, 

 with the posterior angles less obtuse.

3. Platynus bembidioides (Sericoda, bemb. Kirby). A specimen was found 

 on Puget Sound by Mr. Davidson, which in no respect differs from one found by 

 me at Lake Superior. 



4. Pterostichus herculaneus Mann. A specimen (-70 long) was found 

 by Mr. Davidson on Puget Sound, which apparently belongs to this species. It 

 is related to P. algidus, but the two basal impressions each side run into a 

 large fovea as in P. c o r a c i n u s , &c, without, however, leaving any promi- 

 nence or punctures between them ; the little ridge adjacent to the margin is 

 more distinct. The elytra have a faint purplish tinge as in P. a m e t h y s t i n u 3. 



5. Anisodactylus semipunctatus, oblongus, niger, vel aeneo-niger niti- 

 dus, capite punctulato, postice parce punctata, thorace latitudine sesqui

 breviter pubescentibus, stria 2nda postice unipunctata. Long. 15 -5. 



Oregon, Dr. Suckley, California. Resembles in form A. brevicollis Lee , 

 but is distinguished among the black species, having the spur of the anterior 

 tibia toothed each side at base, by the small punctures of the alternate spaces 

 of the elytra. These punctures are sometimes, however, hardly distinct, in 

 which case this may be distinguished from A. brevicollis, consobrinus and 

 californicus, as well by differences in form, as by the sides of the thorax being 

 more distinctly and broadly depressed, and from A. si mil is by the thorax 

 being more narrowed behind, with the posterior angles more obtuse. I find, 

 on careful examination, that the last named species presents traces of fine 

 punctures on the alternate spaces of the elytra. 



6. Agonoderus r u g i c o 1 1 i s, nigro-piceus, thorace testaceo, macula oblonga 

 centrali nigro, latitudine baud breviore, postice paulo angustato, lateribus

 subconvexis, 2, 3 et 4 a quadrante ultra dodrantem nigris, antennis pedibusque 

 testaceis. Long. -28. 



California, Mr. Rathvon. Very similar to A. dorsalis and pallipes, with the 

 posterior angles of the thorax more rounded than in the former, but less than 

 in the latter; it differs from both by the sides being slightly sinuous, by the 

 base being more depressed and punctured, by the disc being very distinctly 

 rugous, and finally by the intervals of the elytra being less convex. 



7. Badister anthracinns, niger, nitidus, thorace latitudine sesqui 

 breviore, postice paulo angustato, angulis posticis obtusis rotundatis, anguste 

 marginato, antice transversini impresso, linea dorsali sat profunda, basi utrinque

Oregon, Dr. Suckley. Related to B. tetraglyptus, but is more convex and 

 much more shining, with the thorax narrower, and the basal foveaj deeper and

 Tounded in front, very faintly sinuate behind, posterior angles slightly obtuse, 

 not at all rounded, dorsal line entire, transverse impressions well marked, 

 base sparsely punctured and rugous, basal impressions not elongated, lateral 

 margin moderate. Elytra almost elliptical, with eight moderately deep strife, 

 not punctured, but marked with rows of brown quadrate cells in the substance,

Puget Sound, Mr. Davidson. Much smaller and narrower than N. hydro- 

 philoides, larger and narrower than N. 1 a t u s , but specially distin-

 joint is almost equal to the fourth, and the third is scarcely one half longer than 

 either. By these characters it approaches Pteroloma, but the mandibles are 

 not many toothed, nor are the palpi acuminate at tip, and the inner lobe of

Puget Sound, Mr. Davidson. A very pretty little insect : the markings on 

 the elytra present a scutellar triangle, and a medial spot having the form of 

 the head of an arrow. 



17. Ceruchus striatus, piceo-niger, nitidus, capite thoraceque grosse 

 parcius punctatis, fronte late concava, elytris striis profundis in fundo densius, 

 costis parcius grosse punctatis, antemiis rufis. Long. '68. 



One female, found at Shoalwater Bay, by Dr. Cooper, and another in Wash- 

 ington Territory, by Mr. Gibbs. Resembles in proportions C. piceus, but 

 is much larger : the thorax is more convex and the elytra more deeply striate 

 and much more punctured. 



18. Corymbetes tinctus. Several specimens of a species were found by 

 Dr. Kennerly and Mr. Gibbs, in Washington Territory, having the elytra of a 

 metallic green or purplish color. These resemble closely in appearance C. 

 aeripennis, and differ only by the thorax being less narrowed in front, more 

 broadly rounded on the sides, and by the stria? of the elytra being deeper, the 

 interstices slightly convex and more rugous, and by the feet being piceous 

 tinged with rufous. C. c a r b o , besides having both body and feet entirely 

 black, has the thorax still less narrowed in front, more strongly punctured, 

 and the prosternum more coarsely punctured. 



19. Corymbetes profractus, elongatus, linearis, piceo-niger, thorace lon-

One specimen, found by Dr. Newberry on the shores of Tlamatb Lake. 

 Allied to A. brevicornis Lee, but very different by the larger and deeper 

 excavations of the thorax. 



This species is unfortunately the only relic of a large collection made along 

 the western border of the great basin : a region in which previously no collec-

A singular genus, which I have described at great length from my inability to 

 place it properly. It seems to have a mixture of characters belonging to the 

 Lampyrides, Telephorides and Drilides, but from the small size of the posterior 

 coxae is probably better placed with the latter. The antennae are somewhat 

 separated, inserted in large cavities, the edges of which being elevated make 

 the front concave ; it is difficult to say whether they are in front of or between the 

 eyes. I cannot determine whether the labrum is distinct or not. The mandi- 

 bles are very long, curved and slender as in Lampyrides. None of the ventral 

 segments are phosphorescent.

San Diego, California : June. I have previously neglected to describe this 

 insect from my uncertainty in regard to its position. I trust that the previous 

 description will enable it to be recognized, for although there is nothing remark- 

 able in the appearance of this dark brown, hairy narrow insect, there is hardly 

 any genus with which it may be compared.

Puget Sound, Mr. Davidson. Belongs to the division Dryophilus Chevr., and 

 differs from a nondescript Pennsylvanian species given me by Dr. Melsheimer, 

 by the thorax being strongly margined on the sides, by the last joints of the 

 antennas being comparatively less elongated, and by the eyes being less promi-

nerly. The basal spot of the margin is concealed in a dorsal view by the 

 prominent shoulders, within which the disc is obliquely impressed. The tho- 

 rax is nearly as in L. v a g a n s , but the form of the elytra is very different ; 

 the species belongs in the neighborhood of L. p u b e r a Say. The subsutural 

 spot forms with the posterior lateral one a transverse band stretching forwards

 of new species. By John Cassin. 



And was referred to a Committee. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to the tooth of the Mastodon, 

 from Tambla, Honduras, presented by Capt. J. M. Dow, this evening. It is a 

 last superior molar, and presents a greater degree of developement of the inter- 

 vening accessory lobes of the crown than is usual in the teeth of Mastodon 

 ohioticus, but it nevertheless mo3t probably belongs to the same species. 



Dr. L. then directed attention to the fine collection of teeth and fragments of 

 jaws of Mosasaurus, from the Green Sand of Monmouth Co., New Jersey, pre- 

 sented by Mr. J. H. Slack, and other gentlemen through him. The specimens 

 illustrate, in a striking manner, the mode of development and succession of the 

 teeth, noticed some time since in the Proceedings, (L857, p. 176). The speci- 

 mens further exhibit variations in form and size, though obtained from the same 

 individual. The teeth, with conical crowns and polyhedral sides, are those usu- 

 ally viewed as characteristic of Mosasaurus. Others had been referred to the 

 genus Geosaurus ; and such as were much compressed with trenchant borders, 

 and without planes, were viewed as characteristic of the genus Leiodon. 



The large humerus, presented by Mr. M. P. Rue, through Mr. Slack, was not 

 found in the same marl pit as the Mosasaurus, though in the same formation not 

 far distant. It bears a strong resemblance in form and size to the correspond- 

 ing bone of Iladrosaurus, though presenting sufficient anatomical difference to 

 belong to another genus. It perhaps belongs to Mosasaurus; the bones of the 

 extremities of this animal yet remaining unknown. 



Dr. L. added he was inclined to suspect that all the remains of Mosasaurus 

 hitherto discovered in America belonged to one species, at least there appears 

 insufficient evidence to separate them. Perhaps, however, the remains of the 

 Mosasaurus, discovered in the green sand of the western portion of the conti- 

 nent, may indicate a different species from those obtained from the eastern por- 

 tion.

Tappius Oral, de Tahnco 



Among the extraordinary usages and customs which have been adopted by 

 man, and which have become nearly universal, none is more so than the use of 

 tobacco. That a plant, the first taste of which is so extremely nauseous, and 

 the effects produced by it so highly disagreeable, should become over the whole 

 habitable world an indispensable article of enjoyment, may well strike us with 

 wonder. Other plants for their exciting or intoxicating properties have always 

 been in use; for instance, the poppy, hemp and the Amanita muscaria but to- 

 bacco never produced these effecs ; rather the contrary, it soothes and indeed 

 stupifies, when not taken in excess. When a sufficient quantity is taken to act 

 with its full power on the animal economy, the feelings produced are most un- 

 qualifiedly disagreeable and annoying, nausea, vertigo, cold perspirations, pal- 

 pitation of the heart, and a sensation which must be very much like the 

 approach of death. Other narcotics, as opium and the extract of hemp, produce 

 nothing but the most pleasing emotions. What then has induced man to adopt 

 the use of this plant so opposite in its qualities ? The answer is contained in the 

 verses placed at the head of this paper, for the effects there described are truly 

 what arise from the temperate use of tobacco. Whether the use of any species 

 of this plant, or of others having similar properties, was known to the ancients, 

 is a question hard to be resolved. All that I can collect on tbis subject follows : 

 Herodotus (Klio, 202) says of the Skythi, that " they take the berries of a cer- 

 tain tree, kindle afire, and assemble around it in parties, and then throw these 

 berries on the fire, inhale the smoke, and intoxicate themselves with the smell, 

 in the same manner the Greeks do with wine; the more fruit they throw on, the 

 more intoxicated they get, until they rise up to dance and proceed to sing." 

 He says they likewise purify themselves after a funeral in the following man- 

 ner. "They make a close tent of felt blankets, with a vase filled with red hot 

 stones placed in it. Then taking some hemp seed, creep in under the blankets 

 and scatter it on the red hot stones, and produce such a vapor as no Grecian 

 stove can. Delighted with the effect produced, they utter loud bowlings ; this 

 stands them instead of a bath, for they never by any chance wash their bodies 

 in water." In this respect they resemble our American Indians, and must have 



1859.]

been as filthy in their habits. The women it appears removed the smell of the 

 dirt, with which they were habitually covered, by the application of a per- 

 fumed paste. Solinus, cap. x. \ 5, informs us that the Thrakes occasion a kind of 

 ebrious excitement by burning the seeds of plants which they possess, and in- 

 haling the smoke. Pomponius Mela, lib. n. cap. n. \ 35, has very nearly the 

 same words. Strabo, however, lib. vn. alluding to a similar custom, calls those 

 who make use of this method of excitement Ka.7rvop'na.t or livers in smoke, or 

 more properly as appears from other copies of his work, KsmttowcIt*/ smoke 

 walkers. The first three authors allude to the use of hemp ; whether they did 

 not put the dried leaves of this plant into pipes, as Strabo's men from the name 

 he gives them probably did, we cannot now determine. It is certain that pipes 

 have been found buried at great depths in the earth, where they could not have 

 been placed within four hundred years. Dioscorides, in his treatise on materia 

 medica, lib. in. cap. 126, says, that the dried leaves of Tusselago farfara, set on 

 fire and the smoke drawn through a tube (infundibulum) and received into the 

 mouth, will cure those who are suffering under a dry cough or orthopnoea. Caius 

 Plinius, lib. xxvi. cap 16, recommends the same, and in the preceding chapter 

 15, the Hyoscyamus niger. Here are instances of smoking the leaves of plants, 

 from tubes or pipes. 



Tt is generally believed that tobacco was not known in Europe previously to 

 the discovery of America. Yet one of the species known, and commonly culti- 

 vated in Europe and Asia, is never seen in this country except as a curiosity in 

 botanic gardens. America was discovered in 1492. If the use of this herb 

 was not known out of our country before this date, it is certainly inconceivable 

 that in a few years after the time of Columbus, a little more than one hundred, 

 the smoking, chewing and snufhng of tobacco should have spread through the 

 habitable world, extended to the remotest districts of Africa, to India and to 

 China, where nations are so averse to introduce any innovation in their customs. 

 But when we come to consider that there is one species peculiar to Europe and 

 Asia, another to Africa, and a third to America, I do not think that it will be 

 difficult to suppose that it may have been in use in the remotest ages. Here 

 follows all that I have been able to collect on this subject. None of the older 

 travellers in thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as Marco Polo, Pego- 

 letto and Clavigo, in 1403, and the Portuguese voyagers, Vasco de Gama, 

 Alvarez, Cabral and Pacheco, about 1500, mention having seen it used ; Postel, 

 Belon and Burbeck, Caspar Balby, John Newberry a.id Rauwolf, about a hun- 

 dred years after, are equally silent with "regard to the custom. Keeling is the 

 first traveller whom I can find observing its use, this was in 1507. Ksempfer in 

 1560, and Isbrand Ides in 1692, say that its use was universal in China, both 

 among men and women. In the year 1607, according to the observations of 

 Mr. Fitch in his voyaye to Sierra Leone, the negroes there cultivated tobacco, 

 which he says appears to be half their food. According to Bosman in 1700, 

 all the inland negroes used to cultivate tobacco, and from the description which 

 he gives of the leaf, it appears to have been the same species as that formerly 

 cultivated by the Spaniards in Cuba and South America. 



Tobacco was first imported into France from Brazil, by Andrew Thevet, his- 

 torian and Cosmographer to the king, in 1558. He says in his work, " France 

 Antarctique," that the natives carefully gather the herb and dry it in the shade 

 of their little cabins. The manner of using it is this ; after drying it, they 

 wrap a quantity of the herb in a very large palm leaf, and roll it to the size of 

 a candle, then putting fire to one end receive the smoke of it by the nose and 

 mouth. It is pretended that Raleigh introduced it into England in 1584, but 

 this is not true. To John Nicot belongs the credit of having first actually in- 

 troduced the use of it into France. It appears that he obtained the seed of 

 it in Portugal, whither it was said to have been brought from Florida. John 

 Nicot was an ambassador from France to the Portuguese court, during the 

 reign of Charles the Ninth. ^Vhen he sent the seed of this plant to France, he 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 95 



accompanied it with a small box of snuff, in the use of which Queen Catharine 

 de Medici took such pleasure, that it soon became popular and fashionable. 

 Thus much for its early history. 



Tobacco, at all times, has had its detractors and its defenders ; theologians 

 and physicians have striven to eradicate its use, or to defend it as a perfectly 

 harmless ingredient, in the pleasant employment of time. The number of pub- 

 lications for and against it has been truly enormous, but those who take the 

 contrary part have been more distinguished by their extraordinary exaggera- 

 tions and barefaced falsehoods, than by any just reasoning on the subject. It 

 would be out of place here, to more than allude to the literary compositions 

 of this nature, particularly those of an early date, at the head of which stands 

 the Misocapnus of James the First, of England. Modern writers, even of our 

 own times, are not wanting, who have not hesitated to invent the most flagrant 

 falsehoods about the use of a substance, which, at the worst, involved only a 

 small loss of time and of money. One has said that the decline of certain na- 

 tions, the Chinese and Turks, must be attributed to the U3e of this plant. Others 

 (calling themselves Doctors in Medicine,) have attributed almost every disease 

 that afflicts humanity to this propensity. The great mortality attending Asiatic 

 cholera has been ascribed to it. The enemies of alcohol, of tea and of coffee, 

 all combine in a warfare against tobacco. They invent the most ridiculous 

 stories to bring these articles into disrepute. Some have had the folly to say 

 that leeches have been instantly killed when applied to those who used tobacco, 

 and that bugs and fleas would not bite such persons. One Dr. Long, of New 

 Hampshire, states that he was consulted by a Mrs. F., "on account of her 

 daughter, who had a small ring-worm at the tip of her nose ; she wished to 

 apply tobacco to it." The Doctor objected, and related to her a story, probably 

 of his own extemporary fabrication, of a father "who had destroyed his little son 

 by the application of tobacco spittle to an eruption on his head." The good 

 woman did not believe the doctor, and when he was gone besmeared the tip of 

 her finger with some of the juice from the grandmother's pipe, and applied it to 

 the ring-worm ; the instant the mother's finger touched the part affected, " the 

 eyes of the little girl rolled up in their sockets, she sallied back, and was pre- 

 vented from falling by the alarmed mother." The child was then attacked by 

 trismus and deep insensibility ; she was, however, restored by the application 

 of ammonia and lavender. " Till this time," says the Doctor, " the child had been 

 robust and healthy, never having had but one illness that required medical ad- 

 vice, but since the tobacco experiment, has been continually feeble and sickly. 

 The first four or five years after this terrible operation, she was subject to faint- 

 ing fits every three or four weeks, lasting from twelve to twenty-four hours. 

 Within the last three or four years these turns have been less severe." 



In the first years of the introduction of tobacco into general use, laws were 

 passed against it, chiefly, I presume, because it was looked upon as possessing 

 intoxicating properties. Amurath, the IV., Sultan of Turkey, finding it impos- 

 sible, himself, to learn to smoke, issued a violent decree against its use. Those 

 convicted of being snuff-takers or smokers, were condemned to receive fifty 

 blows of a cane on the soles of their feet, and on a repetition of the offence, to 

 lose their noses. The same punishments for using tobacco were inflicted by 

 Michael Federowich, in Russia, which law was in force until the accession of 

 Peter the Great. Tavernier relates that, Sefi, king of Persia, punished those 

 who were caught smoking by pouring melted lead into their mouths until they 

 were dead. Chardin tells us the following anecdote of King Abbas, the grand- 

 father of Sefi : Having tried without success to prevent the use of tobacco, 

 the smoke of which was offensive to him, and in order to punish his courtiers 

 who used it, at the end of a sumptuous banquet which he had given them, 

 he offered them pipes filled with dry horse dung instead of tobacco. From time 

 to time his majesty asked them how they liked the tobacco ; they all declared 

 that nothing could be more delicious ; it possessed the perfume of a thousand 



1859.] 




06 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



flowers. The king looking at them with indignation, exclaimed, Cursed be the 

 drug which cannot be distinguished from horse dung. 



The fanatics who first colonized New England, and who wished to make mere 

 animated statues of their fellow creatures, could not resist the opportunity of 

 putting a restraint upon this innocent enjoyment. They therefore ordered " that 

 no man shall take any tobacco publicly in the street, highway, or in any barn- 

 yards, or upon training days, or in any open places," under the penalty of six- 

 pence for each offence. I might fill pages with similar relations, and with 

 accounts of attacks made upon this favorite weed, but I forbear. 



I have used tobacco for more than sixty years without perceiving any ill effects 

 produced by it. I was once induced to abandon it for about six months, but 

 this disuse brought on numerous and painful ulcers of the tongue, which promptly 

 vanished on resuming its use. 



I have never observed it to have any exciting effects on the body or mind, but 

 on the contrary, its action appears to be entirely soothing and sedative. Let a 

 person overwhelmed with fatigue of body and mind set himself down in an easy 

 posture, light his segar or pipe, and cease to think ; by the time his fumale is 

 burnt out, he will find himself entirely relieved from his fatigue, with mind re- 

 freshed, and body strengthened. Drs. Pereira and Christison, say they have 

 never known any well ascertained ill effects having been produced by the ha- 

 bitual practice of smoking. 



The great variety of tobacco met with in commerce, differing in color, in fla- 

 vor, and in strength, does not depend upon a difference in species or variety, but 

 almost entirely on the soil in which it has grown, in the method of curing it, 

 and the adulterations which it undergoes in passing through the hands of unscru- 

 pulous dealers. Thus manured land never produces the plant of the first qua- 

 lity ; for this purpose, a virgin soil, very rich and strong, with but little calca- 

 reous matter is required. This, however, will not endure for a longer space 

 than six years : it gradually deteriorates, until at last it is entirely worn out, 

 and cannot be brought back to its original state by the application of manure. 

 This always renders it disagreeably strong, and highly impregnated with nitre. 

 Calcareous soils produce these same effects, and thus the tobacco of our West- 

 ern States is inferior to the Virginian, and may easily be known by a saline 

 taste. If tobacco be cured without the use of artificial heat, its fine flavor is 

 better preserved, and its color more uniform. Again, if dried with little ex- 

 posure to the air, it becomes of a bright yellow color. The best tobacco for 

 smoking comes to us from the tropics, possessed of a peculiar flavor and per- 

 fume ; this was once the case with all the segars brought from Cuba. At present, 

 those that are introduced into the United States from that island are adulte- 

 rated with tobacco of an inferior kind ; they are not at all like those brought 

 fifty years ago. Either the plant has deteriorated by mixing with other species, 

 or is so adulterated by a mixture with the common tobacco of our country, that 

 the true flavor is entirely lost. Vessels loaded with tobacco, the produce of our 

 own soil, are constantly leaving our shores for the port of Havanna. Besides, 

 large quantities of an inferior quality produced from imported seed are now 

 sent from New England, and either used there or brought back and sold here 

 as genuine Havanna. The last good tobacco that I have smoked was made by 

 myself in Georgia, about thirty years ago. This possessed the delightful per- 

 fume peculiar to the best raised within the tropics ; it was at the same time 

 very mild and burnt freely. There is, however, much imagination in the judg- 

 ment which we form of tobacco. 



I might here point out the method by which deleterious substances are mixed 

 with tobacco, and how the leaves of various other plants are substituted for it. 

 Some of the most extensively used manufactured tobacco has poisonous drugs 

 mixed with it, which increase its action on the system, particularly on the brain, 

 in such a degree as to become really dangerous. Those persons, therefore, who 

 use it for a masticatory, would do well to employ no other than the pure leaves 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 97 



as they are brought from Virginia. Almost all the pressed tobacco is defiled 

 with liquorice or molasses, which substances conceal the bad taste of the infe- 

 rior qualities. The method by which the flavor of our plant is imparted to 

 plants which have none of their own is as follows : A quantity of the refuse 

 tobacco is boiled in wine, or more frequently in human urine, until a strong fluid 

 extract is obtained ; to this some salt is added. It is then poured upon the 

 dried leaves of other plants, such as rhubarb, burdock, sunflower, cabbage, or 

 broad-leaved dock, which, after remaining in the fluid a sufficient time to ab- 

 sorb as much of it as they can contain, are hung up to dry and then made into 

 Havanna segars. Cut tobacco, likewise intended for smoking, is mixed with 

 the leaves of stramonium and foxglove and with opium. There is, however, 

 no end to the dishonesties practised by tobacco manufacturers. 



I now proceed to describe the plant as it has come under my observation, 

 premising that I do not believe that the species here noted are any where to be 

 found in a perfectly wild or native state. Mr. Lehman, the last authority on 

 this subject, enumerates twenty-one species. I have seen but four, and one of 

 these looks very much like some other genus. I allude to N. quadrivalvis. The 

 other species of Nicotiana have but two valves in the capsules. The three 

 remaining species, I know from experience, mutually mix together. I omit a de- 

 scription of the genus. 



Nicotiana tabacum. Annual, viscid, branching. Leaves oblong lanceolate, 

 broad, acuminate, most entire, for the most part strictly sessile, at the base 

 more or less decurrent, subamplexicaul. Flowers paniculately corymbose, 

 terminal, with linear lanceolate bractes. Calyx oblong, five-cleft, the divisions 

 lanceolate acute. Corolla infundibuliform, much longer than the calyx, the 

 tube viscid, greenish, the limb pale rosy, spreading, the lobes ovate acute, 

 capsule a little longer than the calyx, stigma transversely sulcate on the top. 



This is the common tobacco of commerce, called by different names, Vir- 

 ginian, Kentucky, Nagadoches, &c. It is not agreeable to smoke, unless weak- 

 ened by washing in water. It is the only kind fit for chewing. Too much care 

 cannot be taken in the operation of curing it, and much of its goodness depends 

 upon the manner in which it has been dried and fermented. The Indians in 

 this country are in the habit of mixing it with the leaves of Rhus glabrum and 

 Laurus Borbonia, or the scraped bark of Cornus sanguinea, all of which improve 

 its taste in a remarkable degree. 



N. fruticosa. Perennial, pubescent, viscid, branching. Leaves lanceolate, 

 acuminate, most entire, sometimes very shortly petiolate, most generally sessile, 

 the lower ones amplexicaul. The inflorescnce the same as of the preceding, 

 stigma subbilobate. 



This is the far-famed tobacco of the Island of Cuba and of all the tropical 

 parts of America. I have been told that it is the species cultivated in the in- 

 terior of Africa. It is probably indigenous to that portion of the globe. An 

 African, from a region in that country far distant from the sea, who was well 

 acquainted with the cultivation of the plant in his own country as well as in 

 this, told me when he first saw this species growiug in Georgia, that it was the 

 kind which grew in his country. He could not well be mistaken, for the leaves 

 of N. tabacum are very wide, whilst on the contrary of the N. fruticosa they are 

 rather narrow. It is from this species that the so-called Havanna segars ought 

 to be made. But it seems to me that very little of it enters into the composition 

 of what we now receive from Cuba. 



N. rustica. Annual, villous, viscid, branching. Leaves petiolate, ovate or 

 roundish obtuse most entire, sometimes more or less cordate, divisions of the 

 calyx short, ovate or roundish. Corolla greenish yellow. Stigma entire. 



From this species, which is nearly as agreeable for smoking as the last, are 

 produced the varieties called Turkish, Chinese, East Indian, Shirazian and 

 Latakia tobacco. It is said to have been imported from America into England 



1859.] 




98 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



in the year 1578, and yet has never been seen here except cultivated as a curi- 

 osity in gardens, the seed being always brought from China. It must be con- 

 sidered as a species confined originally to the older continents and not known 

 on this side of the Atlantic, until after the discoveries of Columbus and others. 

 I think that I have seen it growing in a quasi indigenous state on the road sides 

 in Europe. No tobacco has ever been seen growing without cultivation in 

 the United States. This circumstance taking place with most of our cultivated 

 vegetables is a certain proof of their having been imported from some other 

 country. 



As has been observed before, these three species will mix together in every 

 possible degree, hence the great number of species which appear in our books. 

 If we take the trouble to analyse these, it can easily be perceived. that they 

 have been produced by hybrid intermixtures, unless fertile hybrids are to be 

 considered as valid species. All those which resemble the JY. tabaci/m, but 

 with narrower leaves than common, or in any degree possessed of the peculiar 

 characteristics of the iV. fruticosa, have been produced by the mixture with this 

 species, and all those with leaves more or less petiolate, whether lanceolate or 

 ovate, as formed by a combination of TV. tabacum, iV. fruticosa and iV. rustica. 

 It is remarkable what strange appearances these will put on ; every possible 

 variation of the principal forms and every gradation of position will be found, 

 all, however, easily reducible to the three original types.

Sp. ch. Very slender ; tail forming one third of the total length. Crown 

 more elevated and convex anteriorly than in E. saurita. Nineteen dorsal rows 

 of scales. Color olive black above, not lighter below the lateral stripe. La- 

 teral stripe greenish yellow, very narrow on the third and fourth lateral rows. 

 No dorsal stripe. Abdomen uniform greenish. 



In form, this closely resembles E. saurita, but is at once distinguished by the 

 absence of the dorsal stripe, of which there is no trace, except for about a half 

 inch behind the head. The color of the upper parts is also much darker, and 

 the first two rows of scales below the dorsal stripe are not lighter than above 

 it. Florida. Baron Osten Sacken. 



SCOTOPHIS CALLIGASTER. 



Coluber calligaster Say, in Long's Exped. 



Sp. ch. Head very narrow, elongated, much wider behind ; nose very 

 obtuse, the whole outline subquadrangular ; much elevated anteriorly, as 

 high as wide before the eyes, flattened and rather depressed on the occiput. 

 Eye large. Vertical plate narrow, much longer than wide, tapering but little 

 behind. Superciliaries very narrow. Postfrontals and loral large. Twenty- 

 seven dorsal rows of scales, only the central carinated, and these very faintly. 

 Ground color olivaceous white ; a dorsal series of transverse brown blotches 

 separated by narrower intervals than in S. Emoryi, b. & G., with two smaller 

 series on each side. Temporal light stripe, narrower than in S. Emoryi. A 

 brown blotch under the eye, and another on the second and third upper labials. 

 Labials not margined with black. 



This is very closely allied to S. Emoryi, from which it differs in having the 

 head narrower posteriorly, with a more obtuse snout, smaller vertical, narrower 



* Specimens of these species are also in the Museum of the Smithsonian In- 

 stitution, Washington. 



[March,

superciliaries, larger loral, narrower intervals between the dorsal blotches, 

 which are themselves less rounded, narrower light temporal stripe, etc. From 

 S. gitttatus, it may be readily distinguished by the color, transverse dorsal 

 blotches, etc. ; and from the other species of the genus it differs in much the 

 same points with S. Emoryi. There can be no hesitation in referring this spe- 

 cies to the Coluber calligaster of Say. The very faint carinations of the central 

 dorsal scales might easily be overlooked. Like S. Emoryi, it bears a strong 

 general resemblance to Ophibolus eximius, to which species Say's description has 

 been referred by Dr. Holbrook, and others ; but from this and 0. Evansii, it may 

 at once be distinguished by the large eye, elongated head, divided postabdo- 

 minal scutella, carinated scales, and other generic characters.

 Ophibolus Evansii Kennicott, Rep. of Mex. Boundary Survey. 



Sp. ch. Light olivaceous brown or gray, with a dorsal series of about sixty 

 subquadrangular emarginate dark chestnut brown blotches from head to tip of 

 tail, and two smaller lateral series on each side. Dorsal scales in twenty-five 

 rows. 



This is most nearly allied to 0. eximius, but differs strikingly in the number 

 of dorsal rows of scales, twenty-five instead of twenty-one ; also in having a 

 more elongated, narrow and elevated head, narrower snout, anterior and pos- 

 terior emarginations in the dorsal blotches, etc.

Sp. ch. Form slender, though less so than in D. docilis. Body above uni- 

 form leaden black, the crown scarcely darker ; abdomen yellow, thickly and 

 irregularly spotted with black, the spots more numerous than in D. docilis, and 

 extending to some distance behind the anus ; head beneath thickly mottled 

 with black spots of much smaller size than those on the abdomen. A narrow 

 light yellow occipital ring, one to one and a half scales wide. Dorsal scales 

 in seventeen rows. 



Resembles D. docilis, from which it will be distinguished by the color, shorter 

 body, narrower head, spots under the tail, and narrower occipital ring; from 

 D. rcgalis by its occipital ring, and from the other species by the number of 

 dorsal rows.

Sp. ch. Resembles V. valerice; vertical and occipital plates narrower. Dorsal 

 scales very narrow and elongated, much more so than in V. valerice, disposed 

 in IT rows. Color uniform light olivaceous brown above ; dull yellowish-white 

 beneath. 



Readily distinguished from the nearly allied V. valerice by the narrower dor-

ICHTHYOLOGICAL NOTICES. 

 BY CHARLES GIRARD, M. D. 



XXVIII. The genus Hadropterus is represented in the waters of the Potomac 

 River by a species, the average size of which is three inches in total length. Its 

 body is subfusiform, compressed, thickest anteriorly and tapering gradually to- 

 wards the peduncle of the tail, which is slightly contracted. The head enters four 

 times and a half in the total length. The posterior extremity of the maxillar bone 

 corresponds to a vertical line intersecting the anterior rim of the orbit. The eye 

 is subcircular and well developed ; its diameter entering about four times in the 

 length of the side of the head; once in advance of its anterior rim. The first 

 dorsal fin is lower and much longer than the second, to which it is contiguous. 

 The posterior margin of the caudal fin is subcrescentic. The anal fin is situated 

 exactly opposite the second dorsal and corresponds to it in extent, but differs 

 from it by its external margin, which is more convex, giving the entire fin a 

 more ovate outline. The ventrals and the pectorals are moderate sized, the 

 former being sublanceolar, the latter subelliptical in their outline. The rays 

 are : D xiv ; 14 ; A 11, 10 ; C 6, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5; V I, 5 ; P 14. The scales are 

 small, longer than deep and very finely pectinated upon their posterior margin. 

 The lateral line constitutes the eighth row of scales, counted from the first dor- 

 sal fin. The ground color is yellowish brown ; the dorsal region being macula- 

 ted with chestnut brown ; whilst a series of rather large, rounded, blackish 

 blotches occupy the middle of the flanks ; a black vertical streak intersects the 

 orbit. The second dorsal and the caudal fins are transversely barred with 

 blackish. The other fins are unicolor, except the first dorsal, which exhibits 

 small black spots close to the rays, below the middle of their height, more con- 

 spicuous anteriorly than posteriorly. 



The species here referred to we will record under the name of H. maculatus ; 

 the specimens examined were caught in an eastern tributary of the Potomac 

 River, in Anne Arundel Co. Md. 



XXIX. Another species of Hadroptervs was collected in the Arkansas River, 

 near Fort Smith, by Dr. George G. Shumard. We propose to call it //. shumardi. 

 It will always be easy to distinguish it from its congeners by the great devel- 

 opement of the anal fin, which is much larger than the secoud dorsal and pro- 

 jects much further back. The body is elongated, rather slender, although taper- 

 ing but little backwards ; its entire length is about two inches and a quarter, in 

 which the head enters four times and a half. The first dorsal fin is longer than 

 the second and nearly as high. I) xi ; 13 ; A n, 11 ; C 6, 1, 8, 7, 1, 5 ; V i, 5 ; 

 p 12. The scales are rather small. The color is somewhat altered by the 

 preserving fluid : an olivaceous tint appears to have existed over the dorsal re- 

 gion with darker spots or dots, whilst the abdominal region is rather whitish. 

 The caudal fin exhibits transverse dark lines, and the first dorsal a black spot 

 at its posterior portion; a dark vertical streak intersects also the orbit.

XXX. A representative of the Etheostomid family was procured by the TJ. S. 

 and Mexican Boundary Commission, at the mouth of the Rio Grande del Norte 

 (Rio Bravo). It constitutes a new generic type, allied to Cato7iotus, and to 

 which we have applied the name of Alvarius, with the following characters : 

 Head elongated and tapering ; mouth terminal, large, not protractile, lower 

 jaw longer than the upper. Teeth very minute, opercular apparatus, cheeks, 

 and throat scaly. First dorsal fin nearly equal in height to the second, from 

 which it is quite distinct. Anal fin much smaller than the second dorsal ; 

 caudal fin truncated. Five soft rays to the ventrals. Ventral scales uniform. 



As to the species, its body is slender and elongated, the head being subcorn- 

 eal and tapering forwards. The latter enters four times and a half in the total 

 length. The eye is subelliptical ; its horizontal diameter entering about four 

 times in the length of the side of the head ; once in advance of its anterior 

 rim. The posterior extremity of the maxillar bone corresponds to a vertical 

 line drawn in advance of the pupil. The first dorsal fin is subtriangular in its 

 outline ; its base is nearly equal to that of the second dorsal, from which it is- 

 separated by a small space. The anterior margin of the anal is situated some- 

 what behind the origin of the second dorsal ; both fins terminating evenly. The 

 ventrals and the pectorals are rather slender. D vi ; 10; A 8 ; C 5, 1, 6, 6, 1, 6; 

 V 5 ; P 14. The scales are very small, finely pectinated posteriorly ; the lateral 

 line being median. The ground color is light yellowish brown ; the dorsal 

 region being occasionally maculated, and the middle of the flanks provided 

 with a narrow blackish streak which extends along the sides of the head to the 

 apex of the snout. This lateral streak has suggested the appellation of A. 

 lateralis, which we have bestowed upon this species. The fins are unicolor, 

 except the caudal, which is transversally barred, and the first dorsal which ex- 

 hibits a black spot at its upper and posterior edge. The largest specimens ex- 

 amined measure somewhat less than two inches in total length. 



XXXI. A mere glimpse at the " Ichthyologia ohiensis" is sufficient to convince 

 every impartial writer, that Etheostoma blennioides was never intended to typify 

 the genus Etheostoma.* The latter is subdivided into two subgenera : Aplesion, 

 in which the spinous and the soft portions of the dorsal fin are combined ; and 

 Diplesion, in which the same parts are distinctly separated. Now, E. blennioides 

 falls immediately under the head of Diplesion. 



Another species of the genus Diplesion inhabits the waters of Chihuahua 

 river. Specimens of it were collected by Mr. John Potts, of Chihuahua, and 

 sent to the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. We call it D. fasciatus. 



It has the same general blennioid aspect as its congener: the total length of 

 the specimens observed, measuring about two inches and a quarter, the head 

 entering in it four times and a half. The eye is of medium size, subcircular ; 

 its diameter being contained four times in the length of the side of the head. 

 The first dorsal fin is lower and longer than the second, to which it is con- 

 tiguous. The anal is well developed, rather deeper than the second dorsal, but 

 shorter upon its base. The caudal fin is subtruncated. The ventrals and 

 the pectorals are of moderate development ; their tips being nearly even. The 

 rays are ; D x ; 12 ; A i, 8 ; 6,1,6,6,1,6; V i, 5 ; P 11. The scales are 

 small, deeper than long, posteriorly rounded off and minutely pectinated, whilst 

 their anterior margin is truncated, exhibiting numerous radiating furrows upon 

 the latter section only. Their imbrication takes place after the fashion of the 

 sciaenoids: instead of longitudinal series, they constitute transverse, oblique 

 series. As to the coloration it is but imperfectly preserved. Transverse bands of 

 deep chestnut brown alternate with white or yellowish ones. These bands, or 

 fascia?, are better defined below the lateral line than above it, where they are 

 sometimes interrupted. The head is brown, with a vertical black streak across

the orbits. The fins are yellowish, unicolor, except the first dorsal, which is 

 margined with black. During life we imagine this fish to be one of the prettiest 

 inhabitants of the fresh waters of this continent. 



XXXII. To such species of the genus Utheostoma, in which the two dorsal 

 fins are united, Rafinesque proposes to apply the name of Aplesion, as alluded to 

 above. A species of the latter genus was collected with the preceding one by 

 Mr. John Potts, in Chihuahua river and tributaries. Its body is rather short 

 and deep, proportionally deeper than in the other genera of the family. The 

 dorsal region is regularly convex from the occiput to the peduncle of the tail. 

 The caudal fin is rounded off and fan-shaped. The spinous portion of the 

 dorsal fin is nearly of the same height as the soft portion, but much longer and 

 superiorly convex. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal. The ven- 

 trals are sublanceolated and the pectorals subelliptical in shape, rather small 

 or moderate in development, the tip of the ventrals projecting somewhat fureher 

 back than that of the pectorals, although not reaching the vent. The formula 

 of the fins is as follows : D x, 1, 10 ; A n, 7 : C 4, 1, 6, 6, 1, 3 ; V i, 5 ; P 1 1. 

 The head, which forms about the fourth of the total length, is rounded upon 

 the snout ; the jaws being nearly equal, the gape of the mouth somewhat 

 oblique, the posterior extremity of the maxillar bone extending to a vertical 

 line which would intersect the pupil. The eye is circular ; its diameter enter- 

 ing four times in the length of the side of the head, less than once in advance 

 of its anterior rim. The opercular apparatus, cheeks and throat are bare. The 

 scales are of moderate development deeper than long, very finely pectinated 

 posteriorly, where rounded off, and provided with radiating furrows upon their 

 anterior section. The color is of a uniform olivaceous brown tint, the dorsal 

 fin rather darker than the rest. We propose to call this species Aplesion potsii, 

 in remembrance of our esteemed friend from Chihuahua. 



XXXIII. A species of Oligocephalus, closely allied to 0. lepidus was collected 

 in Devil's river, Texas, by John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham. It maybe 

 distinguished from its congener just alluded to by a much larger anterior dorsal. 

 The latter is nearly as high as the second dorsal and somewhat longer upon its 

 base. The body is rather short and quite compressed ; about two inches in 

 total length, in which the head enters four times and a half. The tips of the 

 ventrals are nearly even with those of the pectorals. The rays of the fins are : 

 D ix ; 13 ; A n, 8 ; C 4, 1, 7, 6, 1, 3 ; V i, 5 ; P 12. The scales are propor- 

 tionally well developed ; the nape is bare. The groundcolor is yellowish brown, 

 with blackish brown blotches more distinct along the dorsal line than on the 

 flanks. The second dorsal and caudal are transversely barred. The species 

 we will record under the name of Oligocephalus grahami. 



XXXIV. Another species still, of the same genus Oligocephalus ,was collected 

 in the Rio Leona, Texas, by the same party that secured the preceding one. 

 We will designate it under the appellation of 0. leonensis. It is a more slender 

 fish than either 0. lepidus or 0. grahami, although not quite so elongated as 0. 

 linslii. The largest specimens observed measure about two inches in total length, 

 in which the head enters four times and a half. The anterior dorsal fin is 

 longer but somewhat lower than the second dorsal, and superiorly convex. The 

 anal is well developed. The ventrals are small and spear-shaped, as well as 

 the pectorals when in a semi-closed condition. The tips of the latter extend 

 beyond those of the former, although very far from reaching the vent. The 

 formula of the fins is as follows : D ix ; 10 ; A n, 7 ; C 6, 1, 6, 6, 1, 5 ; V I, 5 ; 

 P 12. The ground color is yellowish olive, maculated with black or brown. 

 Second dorsal fin and caudal transversally barred. 



XXXV. We have bestowed the name of Oligocephalus pulchellus upon a species 

 collected in a tributary of Gypsum creek, which empties itself into the Cana- 

 dian river, by the party under Lieut A. W. Whipple, while exploring the R. R. 

 route along the 35th parallel. The only specimen preserved measures an inch 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 103 



and a quarter, and in all probabilities not fully grown. The body is slender 

 and subfusiform, quite compressed, deepest at the insertion of the ventrals, and 

 tapering towards the base of the caudal. The head is slender, subconical, and 

 rounded off anteriorly. The anterior undivided ray of the anal fin is quite 

 large, and a good deal more conspicuous than the second one. There are but 

 six articulated rays to that fin. The ground color is yellowish brown, macu- 

 lated with black or blackish brown. 



XXXVI. Specimens of a species of Boleosoma were collected by Dr. C. B. Ken- 

 nedy, under Lieut. A. W. Whipple, in the Rio Seco, Texas, and in the Rio Leona, 

 near Fort Inge, Texas. It is slender and graceful in general appearance, mea- 

 suring an inch and three quarters in total length, in which the head enters 

 about four times and a half. The first dorsal fin is longer and lower than the 

 second, and superiorly convex. The anal is much deeper than long upon its 

 base, and convex upon its edge. The tips of the ventral fins extend a little fur- 

 ther back than those of the pectorals. The rays are as follows : D x; 10 ; A 

 8 ; C 3, 1, 7, 1, 1, 3 ; V r, 5 ; P 13. The ground color is olivaceous yellow, 

 maculated with black or blackish brown. The second dorsal and the caudal 

 fins being as usual transversally barred. A longitudinal black streak may be 

 observed in advance of the orbits, and a vertical one beneath them. We call 

 the species Boleosoma gracile. 



XXXVII. Under the name of Boleichthys we have instituted a genus which 

 is intermediate between Boleosoma and Oligocephalus. The head is subconical, 

 tapering forwards, the jaws being nearly equal, hence the mouth is terminal, 

 slightly protractile, and of moderate size. The opercular apparatus is scaly, 

 whilst the cheeks and the throat are bare. The two dorsal fins are distinctly 

 separated ; the first being lower than the second. The anal is well developed, 

 although somewhat smaller than the second dorsal. The caudal is subtruncate 

 or subcrescentic. 



The typical species of this genus was collected by Dr. Geo. Suckley, under 

 Gov. I. I. Stevens, in Little Muddy river, a tributary of the Upper Missouri. It 

 is a very slender fish, measuring an inch and three quarters in total length. 

 The body is compressed, tapering towards the peduncle of the tail, which is 

 slightly contracted. The head constitutes a little less than the fourth of the 

 total length. The eye is large and subcircular, its diameter entering three times 

 and a half in the length of the side of the head. The posterior extremity of 

 the maxillar bone extends to a vertical line which would intersect the anterior 

 rim of the pupil. The formula of the fins is as follows : D x; 10; A n, 8 ; C 

 3, 1, 6, 6, 1, 3 ; V i, 5 ; P 12. The lateral line, from the orbit passes over the 

 opercular apparatus, keeping nearer the dorsal than the abdominal line to the 

 peduncle of the tail, hence midway to the insertion of the caudal, when it does 

 not disappear before reaching it. The pectorals extend further back than the 

 ventrals ; the first dorsal is convex. The ground color is yellowish brown, 

 maculated with greyish black. The dorsals and the caudal fin are transvers- 

 ally barred. A dark spot may be seen on the occipital region, and a streak in 

 advance as well as beneath the orbit. We call the species Boleichthys ezilis, on 

 account of its slender appearance. 



XXXVIII. A second species of Boleichthys, which we call B. whipplii, was 

 collected in Coal creek, Arkansas, by the party under Lieut. A. W. Whipple. 

 Its body is more compressed and proportionally deeper than in the foregoing 

 species. The head constitutes a little less than the fourth of the total length, 

 which is nearly two inches. The first dorsal fin is convex in its outline. The 

 ventrals extend further back than the pectorals. The rays of the fins are : D 

 ix ; 13 ; A ii, 8 ; C 2, 1, 8, 1, 1, 3 ; V I, 5 ; P 12. The scales are rather small, 

 smaller than in the preceding species, and the lateral line is but slightly nearer 

 the dorsal than the ventral line. The ground color is reddish brown, incon- 

 spicuously maculated ; a black spot may be observed at the scapular region. 

 The second dorsal and the caudal fins are transversally barred. 



1859.]

XXXIX. Specimens of a rather short and deep bodied species of Boleichthys 

 were collected at Piedrapainte, Texas, by John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham, 

 while connected with the U. S. and Mexican Boundary Survey. We call it B. 

 elegans. The first dorsal fin is longer than the second, and the pectorals extend 

 further back than the ventrals. The formula of the fins is as follows : D x ; 

 12 ; A ii, 8; C 2, 1, 7, 6, 1, 3 ; V i, 5 ; P 12. The scales are of medium size, 

 and larger than in the preceding two species. The ground color is olivaceous 

 brown, maculated with blackish brown. 



XL. In the collections made during the " Exploration of the Upper Missour 

 and Yellowstone," under Lieut. G. K. Warren, there is a species of Boleichthys 

 resembling more B. exilis than any other of its congeners, by the shape of its 

 body and general appearance. It differs, however, from the species just alluded 

 to, by a more compact body, a proportionally shorter head, smaller scales, and 

 the structure of the fins, the rays of which are as follows : D ix ; 11 ; A n, 9 ; 

 C 3, 1, 8, 7, 1, 4 ; V i 5 ; P 13. The ground color is yellowish brown, the mid- 

 dle of the flanks being maculated with transverse spots of blackish; the belly 

 exhibiting a rather orange hue. The first dorsal has a series of vertically elon- 

 gated black spots resembling a dark band across the middle of that fin. The 

 second dorsal and caudal are transversally multilineated. A black streak may 

 be seen in advance to the orbit, and another beneath it. A specimen two 

 inches long was collected by Dr. Hayden, in Cannon Ball river, in September, 

 1856. We propose calling the species B. warreni. 



Catalogue of the Birds of New Mexico as compiled from Notes and Observations 

 made while in that Territory, during a residence of six years. 



By T. CHARLTON HENRY, M. D. 



Assistant Surgeon U. S. A. 



The following catalogue is intended to serve the purpose of a second edition 

 of "Notes derived from Observations made on the Birds of New Mexico, during 

 the years 1853 and 1854," published in the Proceedings of the Academy in 

 April, 1855. 



A residence in the same territory four additional years, has enabled the 

 writer to extend his observations very considerably, and to add much to the 

 varieties heretofore enumerated. 



It will be observed that the nomenclature has been completely modified, in 

 accordance with the extended number of sub-families and sub-genera, which 

 modern science has very generally adopted. 



A few of the species heretofore supposed to belong to certain sub-genera, 

 have, upon more minute inspection, proved to present variations somewhat 

 different from those which then appeared to determine their proper classifica- 

 tion, and have been designated accordingly. 



1. Cathartes aura. 



2. Falco nigriceps. Of this species I never was able to obtain but one indi- 

 vidual, nor am I aware of ever observing others of like character. Met with 

 among the mountains in the vicinity of Fort Stanton. 



3. Gennaia polyagrus. Never more than three or four met with, of which 

 two were procured. 



4. Falco sparverius. Common everywhere. 



5. Accipiter Mexicanus. Rarely met with. 



6. Accipiter Cooperi. Observed about as frequently only as the above. 



7. Buteo calurus. A rare species, never more than eight or ten observed 

 during six years residence in the territory. Of these I was successful in pro- 

 curing four only. This is a remarkably shy and wary bird and exceedingly 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 105 



difficult of approach. I have always observed them solitary and during the 

 coldest portion of the winter along the shores of the Rio Grande. Never ob- 

 served in the mountains either on the Rio Mimbres or Gila to the west, or the 

 Sierra Blanca and Rio Ruidosa to the east and northward. This hawk appears 

 to feed principally upon ducks as far as I have observed, which has been only 

 during the winter season. 



8. Leucopternis Harlani. I have met with this bird on four occasions only, 

 once at the Big Bend of the Arkansaw river, Iadian Territory, in May, 1852, 

 and on three different occasions on the Gila river, in the summer of 1857. I 

 was induced to believe that it breeds high up on this stream, from having ob- 

 served pairs each time when seen on the Gila. 



9. Pcecilopternis borealis. Some of the specimens supposed to be of this 

 species that were obtained are probably P. montanus. 



10. P. lineatus. One specimen only obtained, the only one seen at Fort 

 Thorn, in the winter of '56-57. 



11. P. oxypterus. This hawk I met with and procured on one occasion only, 

 on the Mimbres river, in the winter of '52-'53. 



12. Archibuteo ferrugineus. Met with but once, in the winter of '56-57, 

 on the Rio Grande, near Fort Thorn, where I procured a specimen. 



13. Archibuteo lagopus. Common in winter. 



14. Circus Hudsonius. 



15. Aquila Canadensis. Two only met with, one at the Rio Mimbres in the 

 winter of 1853, the other at Fort Stanton on the Rio Bonita in the spring of '55, 

 both individuals secured. The latter was found fastened to a skunk {M. Ameri- 

 cana) alive, but apparently overpowered by the effluvia given out by the animal. 



16. Hali^tus leucocephalus. 



17. Pandion ham.etus. Rather rare. 



18. Polyborus tharus. But one individual ever met with, in the winter of 

 '56 at Fort Thorn on the Rio Grande, during the coldest portion of the season. 



19. Bubo virginianus. 



20. Otus Wilsonanius. Found, but not abundantly, in all portions of the 

 territory. 



21. Brachyotus Cassinii. Rarer than the preceding. 



22. Athene hypugea. 23. Geococcyx Californianus. 



24. Coccvzus Americanus. Rarely observed, and at no time among the 

 mountains. 



25. Trichopicus Harrisii. A common species in every part of the terri- 

 tory. 



26. Dyctiopicus scalaris. Quite abundant, especially along the mesquite 

 thickets on the Rio Grande. 



27. Sphyrapicus nuchalis. Replaces the varius in New Mexico, the latter 

 named species being unknown there. 



28. S. thyroideus. Found occasionally in all the mountainous portions of 

 the country. Rather rare. 



29. Melanerpes erythrocephalus. During a residence of more than six 

 years in New Mexico, but one individual of this species was observed, in the 

 month of July, '58, upwards of a hundred miles north of Fort Thorn, on the 

 Rio Grande. v 



30. M. formicivorus. Found but occasionally only among the mountains, 

 and only in the vicinity of pine trees. This species is resident throughout the 

 year. 



1859.] 




106 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



31. M. torquatus. This species confines its range to the mountainous parts 

 of the country, and seems closely allied in its habits to formicivorus. 



32. Colaptes Mbxicanus. Replaces the Auratus every where south of 

 Council Grove, Indian Territory, as my observation goes, a few miles south of 

 the place referred to, is the farthest south I have met the Auratus, though it is 

 not improbable their range may extend somewhat more southwardly. 



33. Selasphorus platycercus. Common, and the only species obtained. 

 Found almost exclusively among the mountains. 



34. Antrostomus Nuttalli. Quite common everywhere. 



35. Chordeiles IIenryii. The most abundant species south of Albuquerque, 

 New Mexico. In the portion of the territory where I was located, I do not 

 think I met with any other night jar or true Chordeiles. 



36. Megaceryle alcyon. Not very common on the Rio Grande, but found 

 abundantly on the Rio Gila. 



37. Tyrannus vociferans. The most common species observed. 



38. T. verticalis. Not uncommon. 



39. Sayornis nigricans. Not often met with, and principally on the Rio 

 Mimbres. 



40. Sayornis Sayus. This species is the most familiar of its family, and 

 delights to construct its nest under the portico of houses like our common 

 Pewee. 



41. Contopus Richardsonii, Rarely seen. 



42. Pyrocephalus rubineus. Met with only once, on the Rio Mimbres in the 

 summer of '53. 



43. Turdds nanus. But two or three seen. 



44. Planesticus migratorius. Rarely seen in summer, and met with most 

 frequently during the winter in the mountains. 



45. Sialia Mexicana. 46. S. Arctica. 



47. Regulus satrapa. 



48. Regulus calendula. Both of the above two species are occasionally 

 met with in the mountains. 



49. Hydrobata Mexicana. Only met with on the Rio Mimbres. 



50. Anthus Ludovicianus. 51. Geothlypis trichas. 



52. G. macgillivrayi. One obtained on the Mimbres. 



53. Icteria viridis. (Or var. Longicauda.) 



54. Helminthophaga chrysoptera. 



55. Dendroica nigrescens. 56. D. Canadensis. 

 57. D. coronata. 58. D. striata. 



59. D. CffiRULA. 60. D. ESTIVA. 



61. D. STRIATA. 62. Pyranga jESTIVA. 



63. P. hepatica. But one specimen obtained. 



64. HlRUNDO HORREORUM. 



65. H. LUNIFRONS. 66. H. THALASSINA. 

 67. H. BICOLOR. 68. COTYLE RIPARIA. 



69. Progne purpurea. This latter species seems confined to the Mountains, 

 and builds generally in hollows in pine trees.

76. Oreoscoptes montanus. 



77. Harporhynchus crissalis. A few observed in the vicinity of Forts Fill- 

 more and Thorn, on the Rio Grande. Not observed in the mountains. 



78. Salpinctes obsoletus. Rather abundant during winter among the moun- 

 tains. 



79. Telmatodytes palustris. 80. Troglodytes Americanus.

87. LOPHOPHANES BICOLOR. 88. L. WOLLWEBERI. 



89. Parus montanus. Rather common. 



90. PSALTRIPARUS MINIMUS. 



91. P. plumbeus. Both the two last named specie3 were occasionally met 

 with during winter in the mountains. 



92. Eremophila cornuta. 93. Hesperiphona vespertina. 



94. Carpodacus Californicus. 



95. Carpodacus frontalis. Very much more abundant than the former, 

 which are rarely met with. 



96. Chrysomitris Mexicana. Quite common during summer among the 

 mountains. 



97. C. pinus. Very abundant during winter, both in the river valley and in 

 the mountains.

100. Coturniculus passerinus. Rarely seen. 



101. Chondestes grammaca. 102. Zonotrichia Gambellii. 



103. Junco dorsalis. Found only near Fort Stanton, among the mountain?, 

 where, I should judge, they rested. Never observed during winter. This spe- 

 cies is an excellent songster. 



104. Junco Oregonus.

110 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



Dr. Leidy stated that, in company with Messrs. Vaux, Sergeant, Powel and 

 Tilghman, he had the day before visited the vicinity of Phoenixville, Chester 

 Co., with the view of examining the shales recently removed in widening the 

 rail-way tunnel. The specimens of shales or black slates, supposed to be of 

 triassic age, presented this evening to the Academy, are those which had been 

 collected. Besides obscure vegetable remains, species of Cypridae and Posido- 

 niae, they contain scales, bones and teeth of ganoid fishes, and also teeth of 

 three apparently distinct genera of reptiles. Two of the teeth, elongated coni- 

 cal in form, and finely striated, appear to belong to the genus Clepsysaurus, 

 Lea, the remains of which were first discovered in the corresponding rocks of 

 Lehigh Co. A third tooth, of large size, is compressed conical, and has oppo- 

 site, acute, serrulated borders. It probably indicates a new genus and species, 

 for which the name Eurydorus serridens is proposed. Fragments of similar 

 teeth have been found in the rocks near Gwynned, Montgomery Co. A fourth 

 tooth, much smaller than the one just indicated, has the same form, but has 

 its borders without serrulation, and has the base fluted. It resembles the 

 teeth of Couipsosaurus, of the coal of Chatham Co., North Carolina, but, 

 nevertheless, belongs to a different species. 



The death of Mr. W. I. Broderip, of London, late a correspondent of 

 the Academy was announced. 



On leave granted, a vote of thanks, was ordered to be tendered to Dr. 

 Alexander Bryant, for his donation of fossils, received this evening. 



April 12th. 



Mr. Lea, President, in the Chair. 

 Fifty-four members present. 



Dr. Leidy stated that the specimens of ferruginous rock containing remains 

 of fishes, presented to the Academy this evening by Dr. P. W. Mosblech, of 

 Bethany, Virginia, were of a very interesting character. Dr. Mosblech, in a let- 

 ter, states that the locality of the remains is a horizontal, ferruginous deposit, 

 about one inch in thickness, resting upon an old vegetable soil, overlying a 

 limestone which is considered as the uppermost member of the coal forma- 

 tion ; and it is covered with a soft, sandy, aluminous shale, destitute of or- 

 ganic remains, so far as examined. The extent of the ferruginous deposit is 

 unknown, but it seems to be confined to the College Hill, at Bethany, equal to 

 about four acres. 



The fragments of rock contain a multitude of isolated scales of ganoid fishes, 

 and numerous teeth and small fragments of bones. Most of the teeth are of 

 small size, and have exactly the same form and construction as those of 

 Saurichthys, a genus of the triassic formations of Europe; but others of 

 large size belong to the genus Diplodus, which is also found in the coal 

 formations of other parts of the United States, and of Europe. 



Dr. Leidy added that the fossils from the Green Sand, of Monmouth Co., pre- 

 sented this evening by Mr. J. H. Slack, consisted of fragments of jaws with 

 teeth of Mosas aurus, several bones apparently of a reptile, of unknown 

 character, a jaw of Enchodus, a palate bone with teeth of Pycnodu s , 

 and teeth of 1 o d u s and Galeocerdo. 



The Commitfee on Proceedings laid on the table the number of 

 the Proceedings for March.

Dr. Leidy remarked, that Mr. Jos. B. Hanson, an intelligent merchant of 

 this city, had recently addressed to him a note, to call at his warehouse and 

 examine some masses of the so-called Sombrero guano, containing fossil bones. 

 Two large masses of this substance, now on the table and presented to the 

 Academy by Mr. Hanson, include a number of turtle bones, among which the 

 posterior portion of a sternum of an individual is well preserved. The included 

 bone fragments significantly point to the origin of the rock, imported as a 

 manure rich in phosphates, from the island Sombrero, W. I. This island, 

 situated about 130 miles east of Porto Rico, Mr. Hanson informs us, is about 

 2J miles long, to | of a mile wide, and rises from 20 to 40 feet above the 

 level of the ocean. It is a barren rock formerly avoided by navigators, and 

 .appears to be entirely composed of the rich phosphatic mineral. Analyses of 

 the substance, by competent chemists, indicate it to bear a resemblance in 

 composition to bones deprived of their cartilage, and otherwise altered, as we 

 might suppose bones to be, exposed to the influence of the ocean water. It 

 contains about the same proportion of phosphate of lime as calcined bones ; 

 and it is this circumstance which has directed the attention of enterprising 

 merchants and agriculturalists to its value as a manure. 



When we recollect that the cereal grains, buckwheat, clover and other legu- 

 minous seeds yield in their ash from 30 to 50 per cent, of phosphoric acid, we 

 cannot but feel the conviction that the Sombrero substance, with its 75 per cent, 

 of phosphates, must prove to be of far more permanent value than the true 

 guano. From this, the Sombrero material deserves to be distinguished by a 

 new name, and perhaps the easy one of O s i t e , from its resemblance in 

 composition to bones and its probable origin, would not be inappropriate. But 

 are we to ascribe the immense mass forming the Sombrero rock to animal 

 origin ? Many reefs and shores of vast extent are known positively to have 

 had their origin in the testaceous coverings of the lower animals, but Som- 

 brero appears to be the first instance of an extensive island formed alone of the 

 remains of the higher animals. The composition of the Sombrero substance, 

 with its included bones, leads us to suspect that the island was once a shoal 

 swarming with turtles and other vertebral animals, whose accumulated re- 

 mains of ages have been cemented together, and gradually elevated above the 

 ocean level to the present position of the island. 



Mr. Hanson informs us that no animals inhabit the latter, independently of 

 birds, except a lizard, about one foot in length, specimens of which he has 

 promised to obtain for the Academy. 



Dr. Leidy further remarked that the bear skull presented this evening by Mr. 

 W. D. Moore, of Oxford, Mississippi, had been found, in association with two 

 portions of jaws with teeth of the Mastodon, in the drift of Claiborne Co., 

 Mississippi. The skull does not differ from that of the common black bear, 

 Ursus Americanus. It is the fourth instance in which Dr. L. has no- 

 ticed the occurrence of remains apparently of this species in association with 

 those of Mastodon, Megalonyx, and other extinct animals.

ICHTHYOLOGICAL NOTICES. 

 BY CHARLES GIRARD, M. D. 



XL1. Since we are again called upon to mention the genus Zygonecles, we will 

 venture to point out such structural peculiarities, as, in our opinion, may be 

 considered its generical characters. Body rather slender and elongated, com- 

 pressed, subfusiform in its profile, and covered with well developed scales. Head 

 rather small, depressed, subpyramidal. Mouth very protractile, its gape being 

 horizontal, whether in a protracted or a retracted condition. Teeth upon the 

 premaxillar bones and upon the lower jaw ; an external series slender and 

 acerated, behind which may be observed a band of velvet-like ones. The ori- 

 gin of the anal fin is opposite the anterior margin of the dorsal, or in advance 

 of it. The genus Zjigonect.es appears to be intermediate between Hydrargyra 

 and Gimbusia, resembling more the former by its general aspect, and the latter 

 by its structure. 



Specimens of a species of this genus, and which we call Z. pulchdlus, were 

 collected in Sugar Loaf Creek, Arkansas, by the party under Capt. A. W. 

 Whipple. The largest one measures two inches and a half in total length, of 

 which the head constitutes rather more than the fifth. The eye is large and 

 circular ; its diameter entering four times in the length of the side of the head. 

 The dorsal and anal fins are deeper than long ; the anal being larger than the 

 dorsal, and placed more anteriorly, so that its anterior margin is nearly equi- 

 distant between the apex of the snout and the posterior margin of the caudal 

 fin. The tip of the posterior rays of the dorsal extend as far as the insertion 

 of the caudal, that is, a little further backwards than the tip of the posterior 

 rays of the anal fin. The ventrals and the pectorals are but moderately de- 

 veloped ; the tip of the former extends to the vent, whilst the latter do not 

 quite reach the insertion of the ventrals. The ravs of the various fins are as 

 follows : D 9 ; A 12 ; C 3, 1, 7, 6, 1, 3 ; V 6 ; P 13. There are twelve longi- 

 tudinal rows of scales between the anterior margin of the dorsal and that of 

 the anal fin. The surface of the scales has a rather rugose appearance, owing 

 to the conspicuousness of the concentric lines of growth. The scales them- 

 selves are deeper than long, anteriorly subtruncated or subconvex ; undulating 

 and rounded off upon the remaining edges. 



The ground color is olivaceous brown, of a darker tint along the dorsal re- 

 gion than over the abdomen. A black band or streak extends from the nose, 

 across the eye, along the middle of the flank to the base of the caudal fin. 

 Small black dots, constituting four or five irregular longitudinal series, may bo 

 observed on either side of the dorsal region, above the lateral streak ; the 

 dorsal, anal, and caudal fins being likewise dotted with black, whilst the ven- 

 trals and pectorals are unicolor, like the abdomen.

114 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



XLII. Having had, recently, an opportunity of examining authentic specimens 

 of either species of Limia, inhabiting ihe island of Cuba, and described by 

 Prof. Poey, we are now better prepared to speak of those species which occur 

 along our own shores and in the Mexican provinces bordering the Rio Grande 

 Boundary. 



And before we proceed any further into the history of these fishes, we deem 

 it expedient to recapitulate the characiers of that genus. 



The body, generally speaking, is rather short and deep, very much compressed, 

 and covered with comparatively large scales. The upper surface of the head 

 is depressed, sloping forwards, wedge-shaped in general appearance. The 

 mouth is small, or else, of moderate size, very protractile, directed upwards 

 when in a retracted condition, tlia lower jaw then appearing longer than the 

 upper; but when protracted, the aperture is directed horizontally forwards, and 

 somewhat downwards, assuming the shape of a flattened (depressed) tube, the 

 jaws being equal. Either jaw exhibits a row of slender, curved and acerated 

 teeth, behind which a narrow patch of minute, velvet-like ones may be observed. 

 The anal fin is inserted posteriorly to the an'erior margin of the dorsal, and 

 differently constructed according to the sexes. The dorsal fin itself is higher 

 and longer in the male than in the female. The posterior edge of the caudal 

 is subtruncated or rounded off. 



In the above diagnosis of the generical characters to be assigned to Limia, 

 it is easy to perceive a most intimate affinity between that genus and Pacilia. 

 Indeed, the only difference which is noticeable, resides in the structure of the 

 anal 6n of the male sex, which is narrower and deeper than in the female, and 

 inserted more anteriorly, close to the ventrals ; the anterior rays being much 

 more developed than the posterior ones, which are partly atrophied. Now. 

 such a distinction may not appear of sufficient importance, and ichthyologists 

 might raise the question of preserving these two genera in the nomenclature. 

 In the present state of our personal knowledge regarding these fishes, we should 

 not have established a generic distinction upon that character alone. But, 

 since these genera exist, we shall, for the present at least, speak of them under 

 separate heads, leaving it with future investigations to decide upon their in- 

 trinsic value. Our reason for so doing is the lack of specimens of most of the 

 species referred to the genus Pcecilia, in the " Histoire naturelle des Poissons," 

 and described from specimens of the female sex alone. Moreover, we may ex- 

 pect many new species from Mexico and Central America, which may throw 

 considerable light upon the natural history, yet so imperfectly known, of these 

 little fishes. 



We have examined specimens of Pcecilia multilineata, collected at Palatka, 

 East Florida, by T. Glover. Lesueur himself admits their identity with those 

 he obtained from Lake Ponchartrain. Not having at our command specimens 

 of the latter locality, we are not prepared to express any opinion regarding that 

 point. But we have had under examination from that locality, Mollinesia lati- 

 pinna, which is considered now as the male sex of Pcecilia multilineata. These 

 exhibit the same generical characters which we have assigned to Limia ; there- 

 fore, should further investigations corroborate a generic distinction between 

 Pcecilia and Limia, the latter appellation will have to give way to Mollinesia, as 

 having priority over it. 



Male and female specimens of this same species were collected at Galveston, 

 Texas, by Dr. C. B. R. Kennedy, under Capt. A. W. Whipple. 



XLIII. The species which we have described under the name of P. lineolata, 

 in the " Ichthyology of the U. S. and Mex. Boundary Survey," from specimens 

 collected at Brownsville, near the mouth of the Rio Grande del Norte (Rio 

 Bravo), belongs to the same genus as the former species. It is closely allied 

 to P. multilineata, the female sex being compared, the male sex having not yet 

 come under observations. It differs from the latter by a smaller head, a smaller 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 115 



eye, and a smaller mouth ; the dorsal fin is also placed more anteriorly. The 

 system of coloration being exactly the same in either species. 



XL1V. The species which we have called Limia paciloides is but very imper- 

 fectly characterised in the " Ichthyology of the U. S. and Mex. Boundary. '" 

 Moreover, figs. 12 14, of plate xxxviii, do not belong to the same species. 

 Hence the male sex only is so far known ; it is represented on the plate just 

 alluded to, fijs. 811. 



Now then, if we recapitulate the characters to be assigned to this species, we 

 shall have the following diagnosis : The back is arched and the abdomen 

 qui'e convex; the greatest depth taken in advance of the anterior edge of the 

 dorsal fin enters somewhat less than four times in the total length. The head 

 is contained four times and a half in the total length ; external series of teeth 

 very slender and exiguous. Diameter of eye entering three times and a half in 

 the length of the fide of the head. Dorsal fin neatly as long as deep, superiorly 

 convex, its anterior margin being nearer the apex of the snout than the inser- 

 tion of the caudal. The caudal itself is posteriorly rounded oft* or convex. The 

 anal fin is inserted opposite the middle portion of the base of the dorsal. Ven- 

 trals small and slender, inserted immediately in advance of the anterior edge of 

 the dorsal ; their posterior extremity stretching beyond the anterior edge of 

 the anal fin and overlap, consequently, the vent. The pectorals being rather 

 short and broad, subelliptical in their outline. The rays are : D 13 ; A 6 ; C 2. 

 1, 7, 7, 1, 2 ; V 6 ; P 13. The ground color is reddish-brown, with transverse 

 narrow bands of a darker tint and a small blackish spot at the base of each 

 scale, constituting about seven longitudinal serit s on eitbtr eide of the body. 

 The caudal fin is likewise transversely spotted, whilst the other fins are uni- 

 color. 



Specimens of this species were collected at Indianola, Texas, by John H. 

 Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham. 



XLV. A very pretty little species of Limia, which we call L. formosa, was 

 likewise caught by John H. Clark, under Major Emory, in a lagoon at Paolo 

 Alto. Of this, we have a specimen of either sex, the female differing widely 

 from the male. We will proceed describing them, one after the other. 



The male resembles somewhat the same sex in L. poeciloicfes, from which it 

 may, however, be distinguished at first glance, by a greater depth at the pe- 

 duncle of the tail. The back is likewise less arched, and the abdomen less con- 

 vex; the greatest depth of the body, at the origin of the dorsal, entering some- 

 what over four times in the total length. The head constitutes about the fourth 

 of the total length ; the eye, which is large and circular, enters three times in 

 the length of the side of the head by its diameter. The snout is rather abbre- 

 viated. The dorsal fin is longer than high, and convex or subconvex upon its 

 upper margin. The caudal is rounded off posteriorly. The anal fin is inserted 

 nearly opposite the anterior margin of the dorsal ; it is slender and deep, but 

 far from extending as far back as the posterior rays of the dorsal. The ventrals. 

 which are slender, are inserted in advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal, 

 at a short distance from the anal, between which there is just space enough for 

 the anal aperture. Their extremities project beyond the base of the anal fin, 

 particularly the second ray, which is longer than the rest. As to the pectorals, 

 they are rather broad and proportionally well developed. 



The female specimen, which measures one inch and a half, is more slender 

 than the male. We take it, however, that when adult and full of roe, the pro- 

 portions of the body may assume a different aspect. The greatest depth is 

 equal to the length of the head, which constitutes the fourth of the total length. 

 We notice the same abbreviated snout and large eyes, as in the male sex. The 

 dorsal fin is nearly as high as long, and almost of equal depth throughout, its 

 upper margin being straight or subconvex ; the anterior margin of that fin is 

 somewhat nearer the insertion of the caudal than the apex of the snout. The

anal fin, which is deeper than long, is inserted opposite the posterior portion 

 of the base of the dorsal. The ventrals are small, subtriangular when expanded, 

 their posterior extremity not extending as far as the anterior edge of the anal. 

 The pectorals are well developed, elongated, posteriorly rounded off, their ex- 

 tremities projecting beyond a line drawn at the origin of the ventrals. The 

 rays of the fins are : D 12 ; A 10 ; C 7, 1, 8, 7, 1, 6 ; V 6 ; P 9. We have 

 counted thirteen rays in the dorsal fin of the male sex, and seven in the anal. 

 The structure of the latter is as follows : First and second ray simple, short, 

 and slender; third and fourth most developed, third one stoutest; fifth, sixth, 

 and seventh slender, but deeper than the first and second, and bifurcated. The 

 scales are very similar in either sex, much deeper than long, anteriorly trun- 

 cated, with numerous radiating furrows upon the latter section only, and 

 rounded off upon the remaining edges, with very fine concentric lines of growth. 

 The ground color is olivaceous brown ; the dorsal region assuming a darker 

 tint, owing to a biowu spot which may be observed on the scales, whilst the 

 abdominal region has a lighter and more yellowish aspect. The dorsal fin 

 alone exhibiting transverse series of blackish spots : the other fins being 

 unicolor. 



XLVI. Lieut. D. N. Couch has collected, in the waters of the Rio San Juan, at 

 Cadarecta and Monterey, in the Province of New Leon, a species of Limia, which 

 differs widely from its congeners, as will be shown presently. Unfortunately, 

 all the specimens are of the female sex. The largest of these measure one and 

 five-eighths of an inch, being apparently full grown, or, at any rate, adult, for 

 the abdomen is distended by the presence of numerous embryos. The body 

 appears to be rather short and contracted ; the back being convex and gently 

 sloping forwards. The head is small, constituting about the fifth of the total 

 length. The orbit occupies the third of the side of the head. The dorsal fin 

 is longer than high, superiorly subconvex, its anterior margin being nearer the 

 insertion of the caudal than the apex of the snout. Its entire base is placed 

 upon the posterior declivity of the back. The posterior margin of the caudal 

 is. as usual, convex. The anal fin is inserted opposite the posterior portion of 

 the base of the dorsal ; it is narrow and rather deep, and its extremity extends 

 further back than theposterior rays of the dorsal. The ventrals are compara- 

 tively of moderate size, sublanceolate, their extremity extending to the vent. 

 As to the pectorals, they are narrow and elongated, rounded off posteriorly, 

 not reaching a vertical line drawn nt the insertion of the ventrals. The rays 

 are : D 9 ; A 6 ; 4,1,9,8,1,3; V 6 ; P 11. The scales are very large, and 

 exhibit the general structure alluded to in the other species. The dorsal re- 

 gion to the middle of the flanks is almost entirely chestnut-brown, so large are 

 the spots which are observed on every scale. An obsolete band of black exists 

 along the sides. The abdomen and inferior region of the tail are yellowish, 

 with a golden reflect. The fins are unicolor, except the dorsal, which exhibits 

 a few blackish spots. We call this species Limia couchiana. 



XLVII. Another species of Limia appears to be common about Matamoras, 

 where it was first collected by the late L. Berlandier, whose collection has 

 since been purchased by Lieut. D. N. Couch, a lover and. cultivator of natural 

 sciences. 



Specimens of the male sex measure nearly two inches in total length, of 

 which the head, which is rather small, constitutes about the fifth part. The 

 body is very much compressed, rather deep, maintaining its depth along the 

 peduncle of the tail. The upper surface of the head, as usual, is very much 

 depressed and flattened. The profile is gently sloping from the origin of the 

 dorsal fin to the apex of the snout. The eye is well developed, subcircular, its 

 diameter entering about three times in the length of the side of the head. The 

 dorsal fin is longer than high, and equally elevated throughout its whole length, 

 the tip of its posterior rays not extending as far as the insertion of the caudal 

 fin. The anal is inserted somewhat posteriorly to the anterior margin of the 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 117 



dorsal, and close to the ventrals, from which it is separated by the anal aper- 

 ture alone. The ventrals themselves are of moderate development, overlapping 

 the vent and projecting beyond the insertion of the anal ; the second ray is 

 much longer than the rest. The pectorals are elongated, their tips extending 

 beyond the insertion of the ventrals and the origin of the anal without reaching 

 as far as the tip of the ventrals. The rays are : D 14 ; A 7 ; C 5, 1, 9, 8, 1, 

 5; V 6; P 12. 



The largest specimens of the female sex which have come under our observa- 

 tion, measure but an inch and a half. The general aspect of the body is the 

 same as in the male sex; the head, however, is somewhat larger, being con- 

 tained about four times and a half in the total length. The dorsal fin is much 

 smaller than in the male, and convex upon its upper margin. The anal fin is 

 rather small and inserted opposite the middle region of the dorsal. The ven- 

 trals overlap the vent, but tueir extremities do not quite reach the anterior 

 margin of the anal. The tip of the pectorals extends beyond the origin of the 

 ventrals, but not as far as the anal fin. The anal fin has nine rays. The sec- 

 ond ray of the ventrals is even with the rest. The scales are large, much deeper 

 than long, anteriorly subtruncated, and rounded off upon the rest of the peri- 

 phery. Radiating furrows may be observed upon their anterior section only. 



The ground color is reddish brown, lighter beneath than above, with longi- 

 tudinal series of d^rk spots corresponding to the series of scales, and more con- 

 spicuous along the dorsal region than elsewhere. The dorsal flu is transvers- 

 ally barred with series of blackish spots, as well as the upper lobe of the cau- 

 dai. The other fins being unicolor. 



The above species we propose to designate under the name of Limia matamo- 

 rensis. 



XLVIII. A new genus to which we give the name of Actinia, has the general 

 physiognomy of Limia, but differs from it, as well as from Pcecilia, by the struc- 

 ture of its mouth. The latter is protractile, rather cleft, dearly horizontal when 

 retracted, and slightly directed downwards when protracted ; the jaws being 

 equal, the snout subcorneal, instead of being truncated as in Limia and Pctcilia. 

 The lower jaw is also better developed than in the genera just alluded to, and 

 the upper one is convex instead of being depressed. The male sex differs but 

 little from the female; the dorsal and anal fins holding the same relative po- 

 sition in either of them, being simply larger in the male than in the female. 

 The posterior margin of the caudal fin is subtruncated. 



Specimens of the typical species of this genus, and, as yet, the only one known, 

 were collected at Galveston, Texas, by Dr. C. B. Kennerly, under Capt. A. W. 

 Whipple, at St. Joseph's Island, Tex., by Gustavus Wurdemann, and at Indi- 

 anola, Tex., by John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham. The largest ones 

 observed measure less than an inch and a half in total length, in which the 

 head enters about three times and a half. The head is, therefore, well devel- 

 oped, wedge-shaped, the profile being quite declivous from the origin of the 

 dorsal fin to the apex of the snout. The greatest depth of the body corresponds 

 to the anterior margin of the dorsal, and diminishes rapidly backwards. The 

 eye is la r ge and circular, its diameter entering three times and a half in the 

 length of the side of the head: once in advance of its anterior rim. The dor- 

 sal fin is higher than long, and quite elevated in the male sex ; its anterior mar- 

 gin is nearly equidistant between the apex of the snout and the posterior edge 

 of the caudal fin. The anal fin is deeper than long, and deeper in the male than 

 iu the female ; its anterior margin corresponding to the middle of the base of 

 the dorsal, and extends more backwards than the latter fin. Its exterior mar- 

 gin is rounded off, or convex. The ventrals are rather broad and overlap the 

 vent, whilst the pectorals are elongated and extend beyond the origin of the 

 ventrals. The second ray of the latter fins does not project beyond the others, 

 as is the case with the species of Limia. The rays are: D 9 ; All; C 4,1, 



1859.] 




118 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



8, 7, 1, 4 ; V 6 ; P 15 The scales are somewhat deeper than long, anteriorly 

 truncated and posteriorly rounded, whilst the upper and lower margins are 

 nearly straight and parallel. The concentric lines of growth are very fine and 

 numerous, and short radiating farrows occupy almost the entire anterior mar- 

 gin. 



The dorsal region and tipper surface of the head are greyish olive or oliva- 

 ceous brown, with a darker line at the periphery of the scales. The flanks are 

 fasciated alternatively with greyish brown and light yellowish transverse nar- 

 row bands, the more conspicuous as they approach the peduncle of the tail ; 

 the brown *bands being wider than the light yellowish ones ; there are how- 

 ever instances in which light streaks subdivide the brown bands. The oper- 

 cular apparatus is silvery : the lower part of the bead and the belly exhibit- 

 ing a uniform light olivaceous or yellowish tint. 



The name of Adinia multifasciata appears to us quite characteristic of the 

 species which is here described. An immature female specimen is figured on 

 Plate xxxviii, figs. 12-14 of the "Ichthyology of the U. S. and Mexican Boun- 

 dary," where it is given as the female sex of Limia pceciloides, an error which 

 we now rectify. 



XLIX. Another new genus, which we call Lucania, has the general appear- 

 ance of Fundulus, from which it differs by the presence, upon the jaws, of one 

 row of teeth only ; the mouth itself being fashioned as in Fundulus : the up- 

 per jaw being smaller and somewhat shorter than the upper, arched sideways 

 and subdepressed superiorly. The head is somewhat rounded off and blunt. 

 The insertion of the anal fin is more posteriorly than the dorsal. The caudal 

 is rounded off. The scales are of but moderate development, deeper than long, 

 with fine concentric strife, and furrowed upon their anterior section. The sexes 

 afford no greater differences than in Fundulus and Hydrargyra. 



The typical species of the genus which is here instituted, was figured and 

 described by us under the name of Limia venusta in the "Ichthyology of the 

 U. S. and Mexican Boundary," plate xxxix, figs. 20 23, p. 71. Its present 

 systematic name, therefore, will be Lucania venusta. Fig. 21 gives a most 

 perfect idea of the shape and structure of the mouth. The lateral line is not 

 always so conspicuous as represented in fig. 20. The teeth themselves are 

 proportionally larger than in the following species. The anterior margin of 

 the dorsal fin is nearly equidistant between the apex of the snout and the in- 

 sertion of the caudal. The anal is placed opposite the posterior half of the 

 dorsal, and consequently projects further back. The ventrals are slender, 

 extending as far as the vent, and composed of six rays and not five, as formerly 

 stated. The pectorals are elongated, posteriorly rounded off, and projecting 

 beyond the insertion of the ventrals. The rays are : D 13 ; A 11 ; C 3, 1, 8, 8, 

 1, 2 ; V 6 ; P 10. The scales are deeper than long, anteriorly subtruncated, 

 rounded off upon the remaining edges, with radiating furrows upon the anterior 

 section only, the concentric lines of growth being very fine. The ground color 

 is reddish brown, with groups of dark dots on the centre of the scales ; the 

 fins being unicolor, of a yellowish olive tint. A specimen of this species was 

 collected at Indianola, Tex., by John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham, while 

 on the U. S. and Mexiean Boundary Survey. 



L. We find in the collection of the late L. Berlandier two specimens of a 

 species of Lucania, collected in the neighborhood of Matamoras, resembling 

 very closely the preceding one. The only differences which we are able to 

 detect consist in a larger mouth and larger scales, a more backward position 

 of the dorsal and anal, together with the following formula of the fins : D 12 ; 

 A 11 ; C 4, 1, 7, 7, 1, 3 ; V 6 ; P 12. The coloration is the same. The speci- 

 mens not being perfect, a further comparison could not be instituted. We shall 

 designate them provisionally under the name of Lucania affiiiis. 



LI. Amongst the fishes collected in the vicinity of the city of Mexico, by Maj. 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 119 



W. Rich, in 1853, we notice a cyprinodont of a very peculiar external appear- 

 ance, belonging nevertheless to the genus Lucania, as characterized above. 



One of the female specimens measures two inches and a half in total length. 

 The dorsal region is very much arched from the insertion of the dorsal fin to 

 the nape, which is quite swollen. The head is rather small, constituting the 

 fifth of the total length, its upper surface is subdepressed, the occipital region 

 appearing concave from the sudden rising of the nape, a trait less conspicuous 

 in smaller specimens of the same sex and in the males also. The snout is 

 short, thick and blunt. The gape of the mouth is oblique upwards as in the 

 other species of this genus. The eye is subcircular, its diameter entering 

 three times and a half in the length of the side of the head. There are three 

 slender branchiostegal rays on either side, the outermost being exiguous. 

 The anterior margin of the dorsal fin is nearly equidistant between the apex 

 of the snout and the posterior margin of the caudal fin ; its upper margin 

 is convex and its base is longer than the height of the middle rays. The 

 caudal fin enters a little short of seven times in the total length. The anal, 

 is smaller than the dorsal, but has the same shape, and the same propor- 

 tions between its base and its depth. Its anterior margin is placed poste- 

 riorly to that of the dorsal ; the tip of its rays extending but very slightly 

 further back than those of the latter, so that the two fins are nearly 

 even posteriorly. The ventrals are very small and reach the vent with their 

 extremities. The pectorals are of moderate development, rounded off, not ex- 

 tending as far as the origin of the ventrals. The rays are : D 20 ; A 23 ; C 5, 

 1, 10, 10, 1, 6 ; V 6 ; P 12. The scales are comparatively small, deeper than 

 long, snbelliptical in their outline, exhibiting extremely fine concentric lines of 

 growth, and provided with radiating furrows upon their anterior section alone. 

 The ground color is olivaceous brown, with transverse dark brown bands which 

 run occasionally together giving the entire body, head and fins, a greyish black 

 appearance. Otherwise the fins assume a greyish olive tint. 



The male sex is more slender than the female ; the dorsal and anal fins being 

 somewhat more developed, and the back less arched. The coloration is similar 

 in either sex. 



LII. In speaking of the generical characters to be assigned to Girardinus, 

 and especially of the structure of the mouth, we ought to have stated that the 

 latter is depressed, instead of being rounded, and constructed after the fashion 

 of that of Pacilia and Limia, so that its gape is directed upwards when con- 

 tracted, and downwards when protracted. Accordingly its affinities with the 

 latter two genera are more intimate than with Gambusia. 



The specimen of Girardinus occidentalis, figured, size of life, on plate xxxix, 

 of the " Ichthyology of the U. S. and Mex. Boundary," is the largest of those 

 collected in the Rio Santa Crux, by John H. Clark, under Col. J. D. Graham. 

 Specimens two inches and a quarter in total length were subsequently collected 

 at Tuczon, Sonora, by Arthur Schott, under Major Emory. All these speci- 

 mens belong to the female sex. The following formula of the fins is to super- 

 sede that which has been previously published : D 7 ; A 7 ; C 4, 1, 7, 7, 1, 3 : 

 V 6 ; P 12. The scales are subelliptical, deeper than long, with radiating fur- 

 rows upon the anterior section alone. The ground color is either reddish or 

 olivaceous brown above, and yellowish white beneath, with a golden reflect 

 during the breeding season. The periphery of the scales exhibits blackish dots 

 occasionally so crowded as to assume a dark appearance. Along the middle 

 of the flanks may be seen a black fillet which imitates a lateral line ; the series 

 of scales over which it runs is sometimes entirely black. A black streak is 

 observed along the under edge of the peduncle of the tail. The fins are of a 

 uniform light yellowish tint. 



We refer, for the present, to the same species, numerous specimens in a 

 rather indifferent state of preservation, collected at Tuczon, by Dr. A. L. H er- 

 mann, under Lt. J. G. Parke. Amongst them we observe several individuals 

 1859.] 




120 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



of the male sex, measuring about an inch and a quarter in total length, rather 

 slender in general appearance, and resembling somewhat the same sex in Gam- 

 busia. The anal fin, however, is more slender and deeper than in the latter 

 genus, it being composed of but two developed rays preceded and followed by 

 inconspicuous rudimentary ones. The other fins are so much mutilated as not 

 to allow counting their rays with any degree of certainty. The coloration is 

 the same as in the female sex, just alluded to above. 



LIII. Specimens of a species closely, allied to the foregoing one, were collected 

 in San Bernardino creek, Mex., by Dr. C. B. R. Kennerly, under Major Emory. 

 That creek, it will be remembered, flows westwards of the Sierra Madre, ming- 

 ling its waters with those of the Rio Yaqui, which empties itself into the Gulf 

 of California. 



The largest of these specimens belonging to the female sex measure two 

 inches and a quarter in total length, being therefore of the same size as some 

 of those of the preceding species. Nothing is more alike than the general 

 aspect of these two species ; the present one, however, is more stoutly built. 

 The head constitutes about the fifth of the total length. The caudal fin is pos- 

 teriorly subtruncated. The dorsal and anal fin are inserted somewhat farther 

 back, each beine; provided with eight rays instead of seven ; otherwise the for- 

 mula is the same : D 8 ; A 8 ; C 4, 1, 7, 7, 1, 3 ; V 6 ; P 12. The scales have 

 the same shape and structure, but they are proportionally smaller, than in the 

 preceding species. 



The specimens of the male sex, measure about an inch and a quarter or a 

 little more. They bear the same relations to their females as those of the pre- 

 ceding species. The dorsal fin exhibits likewise eight rays. 



The ground color, in either sex, is of a dark chestnut brown, with black dots 

 at the periphery of the scales, and a lateral black fillet covered by a lateral 

 streak of the width of a scale. A narrow dark streak may also be observed 

 under the peduncle of the tail. In its coloration, therefore, this species does 

 not differ very materially from the foregoing one. The lateral streak alone ap- 

 pears as a more constant feature. 



We shall designate it provisionally under the name of G. sonoriensis. 



LIV. Let it be recalled to mind here, that the mouth in Gambusia is construct- 

 ed after the fashion of Hydrargyra and Zygonectes, and that its gape is horizontal 

 when protracted, and oblique upwards when in a contracted state. Indeed, 

 the affinities between Gambusia and Zygonectes are of the most intimate kind, 

 since in Zygonectes the anterior margin of the anal fin is sometimes situated in 

 advance of the anterior margin of the dorsal. It is true, we find a slight dif- 

 ference between these two genera, in the gape of the mouth when in a pro- 

 tracted condition, and also in the sexes, which assume a different aspect in 

 Gambusia, whilst in Zygonectes the differences between the male and the female 

 are a great deal more restricted. 



The party under Lt. J. G. Parke, on its way home, collected in Caman- 

 che Spring specimens of both sexes of Gambusia nobilis, the male of which we 

 had not observed so far. It has the same general aspect as its female, figured 

 on plate xxxix, of the "Ichthyology of the U. S. and Mex. Boundary," being 

 rather short and deep bodied compared to its congeners. In coloration both 

 sexes agree. The largest specimens of the female sex measure two inches and 

 those of the male one inch in total length. 



LV. Specimens of Gambusia affinis were also collected in San Pedro creek, 

 Tex., and in Dry creek near Victoria, Tex., by Dr. C. B. R. Kennerly, under 

 Major Emory. The male sex measures one and a tenth of an inch in total 

 length, and compares well with the female figured on plate xxxix, of the ' ' Ich- 

 thyology of the U. S. and Mex. Boundary," having the same slender appear- 

 ance and general aspect. The anal finis somewhat deeper than in G. patruelis 

 represented on the plate just alluded to. The color is similar in either sex.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 121 



LVI. As to Gambusia pa'ruelis, numerous specimens of that species were col- 

 lected in the upper affluents of the Rio Nueces, by Dr. C. B. R. Kennerly, under 

 Capt. A. W. Whipple, during the Exploration near the thirty-fifth parallel, for 

 a railroad route to the Pacific. The average size of either sex corresponds 

 pretty nearly to the specimens figured on plate xxxix, of the "Ichthyology of 

 the U. S. and Mex. Boundary." Specimens from the Rio Leona, Rio Blanco, 

 and Rio Seco, exhibit a somewhat lighter tint than those from the lower part 

 of the same hydrographic basin. But this may be an alteration subsequent to 

 their immersion in alcohol. 



LVII. A curious little species of Gambusia from the hydrographic basin of the 

 Rio San Juan, specimens of which having been collected in Rio San Diego, one 

 of its affluents, near Cadereita, New Leon, by D. N. Couch. The largest ones 

 measure an inch and a half in total length, and belong to the female sex alone. 

 The body is deep upon its middle and the tail tapering. The head enters about 

 four times and a half in the total length. The eye is proportionally large and 

 circular ; its diameter entering three times in the length of the side of the head. 

 The dorsal fin is very narrow and elevated, and proportionally higher than 

 in the other species so far known of this genus. The anal fin is likewise nar- 

 row and deep, and resembles the dorsal in that respect. The ventrals are 

 small, and the pectorals well developed. We have not been able to count with 

 accuracy the rays of the fins, owing to the desiccated condition of the specimens 

 preserved ; in the dorsal and anal fins they are less numerous than in the 

 other species of the genus. The color of the body is reddish-brown, except 

 the belly, which is yellowish or whitish. Small black spots may be observed 

 along the dorsal region near the base of the scales. The dorsal and anal fins 

 are greyish ; the caudal ventrals and pectorals, olivaceous. 



The species might be designated under the appellation of Gambusia speciosa. 



LVIII. In the collection of the late Louis Berlandier, of Matamoras, we find 

 another species of Gambusia, which differs from its congeners by the slender- 

 ness of its form and general appearance : hence the name of G. gracilis by 

 which we propose to record it. 



The largest female specimens measure about an inch and a half in total 

 length, of which the head constitutes a little more than the fifth. The mouth 

 is rather large compared to that of the foregoing species. The diameter of the 

 eye enters about three times in the length of the side of the head. The body 

 in its profile is subfusiform. The dorsal fin is higher than long, superiorly 

 convex. The caudal is rounded off posteriorly. The anal is larger than the 

 dorsal, deeper than long and exteriorly convex, the posterior extremity of its 

 insertion being nearly opposite the anterior margin of the dorsal. The tip of 

 the ventrals extends almost to the anterior margin of the anal. The pectorals 

 are well developed and project beyond the insertion of the ventrals. The rays 

 are : D 6 ; A 9 ; C 5, 1, 6, 6, 1, 4 ; V 6 ; P 13. The scales are moderate sized, 

 much deeper than long, subelliptical in their outline, more convex posteriorly 

 than anteriorly with numerous and well developed radiating furrows upon the 

 anterior portion alone. 



The largest male specimens which have come under our observation mea- 

 sure a little over an inch in total length. They are very similar to the female 

 sex, rather more slender. The anal fin exhibits the usual structure peculiar 

 to that genus. The first ray is a mere rudiment ; the second being the stoutest 

 and longest ; the third forms, with the second, the elongation of that fin, and 

 is followed by four shorter rays somewhat better developed, however, than in 

 the other species, which we have examined. 



The color is olivaceous brown ; the dorsal and caudal fin exhibits narrow 

 transverse, blackish bars ; the other fins being olivaceous. 



LIX. Mr. John Potts has collected in Chihuahua River another species of Gam- 

 busia which appears to reach a larger size than any of the foregoing spe- 



1859.] 




122 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



cies, reminding us somewhat by its general appearance those occurring in 

 Cuba. 



The specimens before us are all of the female sex, and measure two inches 

 and a quarter in total length, in which the head enters about five times. The 

 head itself is rather short, whilst the mouth is proportionally large. The dia- 

 meter of the eye enters thrice in the length of the side of the head. The 

 dorsal fin is higher than long, somewhat convex superiorly. The caudal is 

 rather short and subtruncated posteriorly. The anal is deeper than long and 

 a little broader than the dorsal ; the middle of its insertion corresponding to 

 the anterior margin of the dorsal. The ventrals are very small and far from 

 reaching the vent with their extremities. The pectorals are of moderate de- 

 velopment, spear-shaped when not expanded. The rays are : D 9 ; A 10 ; 

 C 6, 1, 7, 7, 1, 6 ; V 6; P 12. The middle rays of the dorsal and anal fins 

 exhibit bifurcations of the second degree conspicuously developed. The scales 

 are of moderate development. The body is chestnut brown, and the abdomen 

 yellowish golden, with blackish specks along the middle of the flanks to the 

 caudal fin. The periphery of the scales is margined with black. The dorsal, 

 caudal and anal fins are greyish and speckled, the ventrals and pectorals being 

 olivaceous. 



To distinguish this species from its congeners, the name of G. senilis is here 

 proposed.

The characters of the following subfamilies are taken from the position, etc.,

 thus formed will be found to be more natural than those established exclusively 

 upon the form of the tongue. 



1. AMBYSTOMIN,. 



Palatine teeth upon elevated processes of the vomero-palatine bones, in

The great aquatic Salamander of Japan is closely allied to our Protonop- 

 Bis (Menopoma Harlan), but the absence of branchial slits places it among the 

 true Salamanders. By the position of the palatine teeth it evidently belongs to the 

 present subfamily, and not among the Tritons, as placed by Dr. Hallowell.

C. maculata. Ambystoma maculatum Hallowell, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci., 

 Second Series, vol. iii. p. 355. 



This species, which inhabits New Mexico, makes the nearest approach to the 

 preceding genus in the form of the series of palatine teeth. In this respect it 

 also exhibits too great a departure from the straight or slightly angular series 

 of Ambystoma, to remain in that genus. 



3. Ambystoma (Tsch.) 



The nearest approach to the preceding species, in general appearance and 

 form of the palatine series, is seen in the Ambystoma nebulosumof Dr. Hal- 

 lowell : but the processes are not arched, but straight, presenting an obtuse angle 

 forward. 



The genus Xiphonura Tschudi (Heterotriton Gray) does not seem to be suffi- 

 ciently distinct either with respect to dental peculiarities, or the form of the 

 tail. Though Ambystoma ingens, luridnum, and Californiense re- 

 semble each other in these points, and are quite different from the A. opacam, 

 yet by the intervention of such species as A. tigrinum (Green) 1 uscnm 

 (Hallowell) b i c o 1 o r (Hall.) p u n c t a t um (Linn.), which show a regular 

 gradatiou of form, the hiatus is filled, and no generic division can be made. 



The following species appears to be undescribed : 



A. c o n s pe r s um . Head oval, rather large ; extremities slender, fourth toe 

 twice as long as second ; tail not longer than body, much compressed; tongue 

 elliptical, very slightly free at the sides ; palatine teeth in two short patches 

 between the internal nares, presenting a concavity backwards. Length 1 inch 

 10 lines : head 4 1. : body 9 1. : tail 9 1. Head, back and tail cinereous brown, 

 finely speckled with white dots, which are confluent on the snout. An indis- 

 tinct row of white spots on the sides. Beneath dirty white. 



Londongrove, Chester Co., Pennsylvania. 



The animal described was probably not fully grown, so that though the 

 measurements indicate the smallest known Ambystoma, the adult may be 

 larger. We are unable to refer it as the young of any of our Pennsylvania 

 Ambystomata. The form of the tail would indicate aquatic habits, but it was 

 found in the woods, and when placed in water showed the greatest aversion 

 to it. 



It resembles Ambystoma porphyritic um of the Academy's collection, but 

 differs in color of abdomen, lateral series of spots, and larger head and mouth. 

 (We allude to the specimen f<orn the Wabash, presented by Dr. McMurtrie). 

 The two latter points, it will be noticed, are those in which this Wabash 

 specimen differs from Prof. Green's description, according to Dr. Hallowell. 

 (Proc. A cad., Feb. 1 856). A. porphyriticum has as yet been found west of 

 the Alleghanies only. The young of A. 1 a te r al e (Hall.) is not known, nor 

 has the geographical distribution of that species been well ascertained. We 

 have been unable to find Gray's description of his A. p u n c t u 1 a t u m, which 

 is, however, a Californian species. 



4. Onychodactylds(TscIi.) The genus Ensatina (Gray) which is stated by 

 Dr. Hallowell (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. vol. 8, p. 238) to be destitute of sphenoidal 

 teeth, may enter this subfamily. 



2. SPELERPINJE. 



Palatine teeth in short series upon transverse processes of the palatine bone; 

 sphenoidals numerous, aggregated upon two thin, ovate or elongate bony plates 

 (becoming cartilaginous), which lie longitudinally and contiguously upon the 

 sphenoid bone. Tongue (generally) thin, borne upon the much exserted carti- 

 laginous elongation of the os hyoides ; some genera with an additional anterior 

 membranous attachment. Form slender; skin smooth. North America and 

 Europe.

I. Plethodontje. 



Tongue with a membranous attachment from the pedicel to the anterior edge, 

 leaving the lateral and posterior borders more or less free. 



1. Plethodon (Tsch.) The tongue in this genus is not attached by its pos- 

 terior border, as described, though very slightly free. 



2. Desmognathus (Baird). D. auriculata (Holbrook). D. nigra 

 (Green). 



D. f u s c a (Green). Salamandra quadrimaculata (Holbrook) is undoubtedly 

 the young of this species. 



The teeth of this species as in all others of the Spelerpinos that we have ex- 

 amined, are acrodont. Superior and inferior maxillaries slightly curved, com- 

 pressed; summits truncate, having a cutting edge interiorly, and a sharp point 

 exteriorly, with a crescent- shaped depression between. Color hyaline, point 

 and edge amber. Sphenoidals more cylindrical and incurved. 



D. ochrophaea .* Form more slender than D. f u s c a, less so than Pleth. 

 erythronotus. Tail as long as the head and body, subquadrangular at base, 

 beyond, slender and slightly compressed. Thirteen distinct costal folds. 

 Length 2 inches 111.; tail 17 1. 



Color above, varying from bright to dirty and fuscous straw color, most 

 specimens with an indefinite medial row of irregular brown spots, a deep brown 

 line passing through the eye and along the dorso-lateral region of the body to 

 the end of the tail ; distinctly defined along its upper edge; fading into fuscous 

 marblings on the sides. Belly pure white. 



Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. 



This is a terestrial species, and very common beneath the bark of hemlock 

 logs. We have never noticed it in the South-eastern part of Penna., but it has 

 probably been passed over as Spelerpes b i 1 i n e a t a, to which it bears consider- 

 able resemblance, or as a pale variety of Plethodon erythronotus. From the 

 latter it differs in attachment of tongue, less slender form, want of marblings 

 on the belly, etc. Brownish yellow takes the place of red on the back, though 

 the young have indications of the same indefinite pink spotting as in that 

 species and Desm. f u sea.

* Since the above was sent to press, we have been informed by Prof. Baird that 

 he considers this animal identical with Salamandra H al d e m an i (Holbrook) 

 which he is of opinion is one of the "very numerous varieties of Desmognathus 

 f us ca." We have never seen Prof. Holbrook's original specimens of S. H aide- 

 man i, but it has been represented by all subsequent authors to be a Spelerpes 

 (Cylindrosoma D. & B.), a genus differing from Desmognathus in its boletoid 

 tongue. We would also hazard a doubt as to the identity of this animal with 

 Desm. f u s c a. The latter is decidedly aquatic in its habits, living beneath stones, 

 etc., in rapid streams. 



The former we have never seen in the water, but have invariably found it 

 beneath bark, under logs, etc. It is rather sluggish, resembling Plethodon 

 erythronotus in this respect. Should this animal be the Salamandra Ha Id e- 

 m a n i of Holbrook, it will stand as Desmognathus H a 1 d e m a n i Nob.

cavity, terminating in two points, the interior much larger than the exterior; 

 both of a bright amber color, the body of the tooth being hyaline in appearance. 

 The palatines are similar to the superior maxillaries, the inferior maxillaries 

 only differ in being flattened on their inner side, and the sphenoidal in being 

 more curved. 



3. Hynobiin*. 



Vomero-palatine bones destitute of teeth, posteriorly elongated and cuneiform, 

 occupying a deep emargination in the outline of the sphenoid bone. Sphenoidal 

 teeth present, upon the outer edge of two ridges of the sphenoid bone which 

 lie along the sphenoido-palatine suture, thus forming two longitudinal series 

 closely approximated posteriorly, widely diverging and becoming transverse, 

 anteriorly. Tongue rather large, much attached. Yery aquatic species. 

 Japan. 



This subfamily presents a singular and very distinct modification of the 

 arrangement of teeth on the palate. 



Tschudi has distinguished generically the only two species of this subfamily. 

 under tbe names Pseudosalamandra and Hynobius, and apparently upon insuf- 

 ficient grounds. MM. Dumeril and Bibron have united them under the name 

 Ellipsoglossa, but as Tschudi's names have priority, one or the other of them 

 must be adopted. We select as the least objectionable

4. SALAMANDRIX^. 



Palatine teeth upon the inner edge of processes of the palatine bones, which 

 are elongated horizontally and posteriorly over the sphenoid. No transverse 

 palatine series. Tongue generally thick, and seldom free to much extent. 

 Skin mostly rough, or changing with the habitat. Form usually stout. Eu- 

 rope, North America and Japan. 



It would appear as though herpetologists had not given the same attention 

 to the clear definition of their genera among the animals of this subfamily, as 

 elsewhere. In the following brief synopsis, the diagnoses of the genera have 

 been drawn up with reference to and including only the distinctive characters. 



I. SalamaxdrjE. 



Palatine processes slender, curved, approximating posteriorly. Ribs not 

 developed. Terrestrial species.

B. ventricosus (Tsch.) 



III. Tritones. 

 Palatine processes cuneiform. Ribs not developed. Habits aquatic, many 

 species furnished in the breeding season with dorsal crests, and interdigital 

 membranes. 



5. Glossoliga (Bp.) Longitudinal series of palatine teeth in two widely 

 separated rows, slightly converging anteriorly. A strong postorbitar arch, 

 formed by the union of a process of the posterior frontal with that of the tym- 

 panic bone. Maxillary bone uniting immediately with the pterygoids. Tongue 

 rounded, free posteriorly and laterally. Digits 4 5. Tail moderate, some- 

 what compressed.

 Euproctus, with which Dum. & Bibron unite it. 

 G. Poire ti (Gervais.) 



6. Diemyctylus (Rafinesque.) Longitudinal series of palatine teeth in two 

 straight rows, closely approximated anteriorly, widely diverging posteriorly. 

 A strong long arch above and behind the orbit formed by the united processes 

 of the posterior frontal and tympanic bones. Tongue small, thick, oval, at- 

 tached by its whole inferior surface or with a very slightly free lateral border. 

 Digits 4 5, the exterior and interior upon the hind feet rudimentary. Tail 

 moderate, compressed.

We regret that the law of priority compels us to employ Rafinesque's objec- 

 tionable name in preference to Cynops Tschudi or Taricka Gray. We prefer 

 Diemyctylus, though apparently unmeaning, to the egregiously inappropriate 

 JVotopthalmus of the same date.

This species in the development of the temporal region exhibits characters 

 most typical of the genus. We fail to perceive the generic difference admitted 

 by authors to exist between this and the following species.

 miniatus, which we think with Dr. Hallowell (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Feb. 

 1856) is a state of D. viridescens. We have caught specimens with or

without the dorsal or ventral spots ; destitute of, with rudimentary, or fully 

 developed crests; and of ever}' shade of color between vermillion and brownish 

 green. The color and character of the skin seem to be dependent upon the 

 amount of moisture in the situations in which they are found. Those from 

 high and dry spots are redder and rougher than those from marshy situations : 

 while those whose habits are for the time aquatic, are still greener and smooth- 

 er, and exhibit every degree of development of the dorsal crest. Thus it is 

 probable that this species undergoes changes similar to those of the European 

 Tritons, as detailed by Schlegel and Kaup. 



7. Euproctus, (Gene.) Series of palatine teeth closely approximated ante- 

 riorly, posterior extremities widely diverging. Skull elongated, depressed. A 

 weak post orbitar arch formed by the slender processes of the posterior frontal

 the intervention of a jugal bone. Tongue oval, free behind ami at the sides. 

 Anal region frequently prolonged. Digits 4 5. Tail compressed.

This and the following three species have been described by MM. Dum. k 

 Bibron as Tritons, but are considered by M. Alfd. Duges (Osteologie et Myologie 

 des Batraciens) as varieties of Euproctus platycephalus. The present 

 species is evidently a Euproctus, judging from the figure of the skull in the 

 Erpetologie generale.

8. Lissotriton (Bell.) Series of palatine teeth nearly in contact anteriorly,

The form of the tongue seems to be the only peculiarity which separates thi? 

 species from the true Tritons. This, though a slight character, is probably 

 better than that upon which Prof. Bell principally relies in establishing the 

 genus viz.: the smoothness of the skin : thus including the Triton palmi- 

 p e s , and perhaps other species at proper seasons of the year. 



9. Triton (Laurenti). Series of palatine teeth closely approximated anteri-

On the genus CALLIONYMUS of Authors. 

 BY THEO. GILL. 



In the genus Callionymus, as it has been restricted by modern naturalists, 

 three distinct genera are yet confounded. Sharing all of the following charac- 

 ters, two of them differ so much from each other in the position of the bran- 

 chial apertures, that there can be no doubt of their claims to rank as separate 

 genera. The characters common to all, and which distinguish them as a sub- 

 family, will be first given, and afterwards the generic diagnoses. 



The body is elongated, and often transversely oval anteriorly, and conse- 

 quently broader than high ; thence it gradually declines in height and thick- 

 ness to the base of the caudal fin, and being often quite thick near that fin, 

 assumes there a peculiar bulging appearance. The whole is naked and smooth. 



The lateral line commences at the mastoids, and is connected, near its 

 origin to that of the opposite side by a transverse nuchal line ; thence it ge- 

 nerally declines slightly, and is then continued along the side of the back or 

 the upper part of the side to the caudal fin. 



The head is in general outline depressed and triangular, but varies in de- 

 tail. The preopercle has a stout horizontal process which generally terminates 

 posteriorly in a group of radiating and recurved spines, one above the other, 

 or which has the spines along the superior border. The profile is oblique. 

 The preorbitals or first sub-orbitals are prolonged anteriorly and frequently 

 extended towards each other, thus forming a roof under which the jaws are 

 concealed when retracted. There appears to be on each side but a single 

 nostril, which is situated before the eye. 



The mouth is small and sub-terminal, but under the muzzle, and is protrac- 

 tile downwards. 



The teeth are villiform, and present in a moderately broad band in each 

 jaw. The palate is smooth. 



The tongue is generally far within the mouth ; it is sometimes entirely 

 united to the floor of the mouth, while at other times it is anteriorly free. 



The branchiostegal membrane has on each side five or six slender rays. 



The branchial apertures are very small and superior. 



The first dorsal fin commences before the bases of the pectorals ; it varies in 

 shape, but there appears to be a constant arrangement of the rays. These are 

 always four in number, and the first two are approximated at the base, but as 

 the membrane enlarges, diverge from each towards their ends ; the third is 

 considerably posterior : the fourth is separated by a still wider interval from 

 the third. 



The second dorsal commences a short distance behind the first, is oblong 

 and is distant from the caudal less than its length. 



The anal has the form and structure of the second dorsal, but its commence- 

 ment and termination are posterior to those points of the dorsal. 



The caudal is elongated, but narrow, and has only from ten to thirteen ar- 

 ticulated rays, of which from one to three of the superior and inferior are 

 simple. 



The pectoral fins are well developed, and are angular at the middle of their 

 posterior margins. Their bases are vertical, but concave. 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 129 



The ventrals are on the skies of the breast, and their bases are parallel or 

 nearly so with the fish's length : they are separated from each other by a very 

 wide and flattened area, and their posterior rays are connected by a membrane 

 to the lower half of the bases of the pectoral fins. These fins are more or less 

 larger than the pectorals. 



Such are the chief external characters of this singular group, and as they 

 are apparently common to all its species, they should in this case be elimi- 

 nated from the generic, and much more from the specific description. The 

 different proportions of these parts are their relative situation to each other, 

 are alone specific characters. The fins present a singular diversity, not alone 

 in form, but in structure, in even the same species. Some of them, especially 

 the first dorsal and caudal, are often much more developed in the males than 

 in the females. The rays, at least of many of them, are very variable in their 

 character, sometimes nearly all them being simple, and at others, almost all 

 are branched. It is therefore impossible to now give a formula indicative of 

 the exact permanent condition of the fins. 



Two of the genera confounded under the name of Callionymus, as has been 

 already stated, differ chiefly in the position of the branchial apertures. In the 

 true Callionymi, they are of an oval form, and situated near the inner angle of 

 the superior opercular margin, and on the sides of the nape. In another group, 

 they are present as small perpendicular slits behind the opercular margin, and 

 have been well described by Valenciennes in the article on Callionymus oper- 

 cularis. They are by that naturalist said to be concealed by a long pointed 

 production of the operculum, and by a membrane which connects this produc- 

 tion to the nape, and they thus present the appearance of transverse slits 

 under this membrane when the opercula arc raised up. Valenciennes has well 

 remarked that the species whose peculiarity he thus describes may one day 

 become the type of a peculiar sub-genus, but he has not so named it. There 

 can be at this day no doubt entertained as to the propriety of forming for the 

 species thus distinguished a distinct genus, and the name of Synchiropus is 

 offered as its generic appellation, a name which alludes to the peculiar con- 

 nection of the ventrals to the bases of the pectorals. The genus that will be 

 described under this name does not embrace the Callionymus dactylopus of 

 Bennet which is the type of a distinct, but allied genus. 



The generic diagnoses of the genera will then be as follows : 



I. Callionymus, L. restr. 



Aperturae branchiales ovataa, in latere nuchae utroque sitae. Pinnae ven- 

 trales spina et quinque radiis ramosis, omnibus membrana conjunctis. 



This genus, as far as relates to the species referred to it, is synonymous 

 with the genus Uranoscopus of Gronovius, who has reversed the Linnaean names 

 of Callionymus and Uranoscopus, as used by modern naturalists, the former 

 Gronovian genus including the Uranoscopi and the latter the Callionymi. 



Besides the numerous species that have been already described, two that 

 appear to be undescribed are in the collection of the North Pacific Exploring 

 Expedition. One (C. taniatus Gill,) is lilac colored, with a silvery line and 

 row of spots on the sides, and with a black spot, bordered by white, on the 

 first dorsal. The other (C. inframundus Gill,) is light brownish, marbled 

 with white, and with a blackish first dorsal. The former is from China ; the 

 latter from Japan. 



II. Synchiropus, Gill. 



Aperturae branchiales parvae, lineares, fere perpendiculares, post opercula. 

 Pinnae ventrales radiis spinoso et quinque ramosis membrana conjunctis. 



The genus thus characterized embraces five known species, which are all 

 inhabitants of the Eastern seas;

130 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



The specimen figuredby Richardson is a female. The male is distinguished 

 by a more slender and elongated body, and by a first dorsal, about a third 

 higher than that of the female. The first dorsal has also a black spot margined 

 with white at the posterior angle, and the two bars of the caudal which are 

 present in the female are absent in the male. There are also two rows of 

 blue spots on the anal of the female, which are not mentioned in Richardson's 

 descriptions: these spots are replaced in the males by two corresponding lines. 

 Richardson simply states that his fish has a narrow streak of dusky brown 

 near the lower border of the anal. There can, however, be no doubt as to the 

 specific identity of these three varieties. Mr. Stimpson dredged specimens at 

 Hong Kong from a depth of eight fathoms.

A third genus with the branchial apertures in the same position as Sy7ichi- 

 ropus, is readily distinguished from that genus, as well as from the true 

 Callionymi, by its first articulated ray ; this ray is unbranched and much 

 longer than the following, from which it is almost entirely separated, and is 

 only connected with the spinous ray. To the only known species, the name 

 of Callionymus dactylopus has been given. As the specific name alludes to the 

 principal generic character, and is also much more appropriate as a generic 

 than a specific one, it is now conferred on the genus, and the name of its author 

 is given as a specific one.

Description of HYPOBHAMPHTJS, a New Genus of Fishes allied to Hemi- 



rhainphus, Cuv. 



BY THEO. GILL. 



All those species of fishes which resemble in external form the Esox Brazili- 

 tfisis of Linnaeus, and for which Cuvier framed the genus Ilemirhamphus, have 

 been described as having a straight band of short, granular and equal teeth in 

 each jaw.* Such is the character given to the genus by Valenciennes, in the 

 nineteenth volume of the " Histoire Naturelle des Poissons," where twenty- 

 seven species are referred to it. This character is also repeated in many of the 

 specific descriptions, and many of the species are distinguished by the more or 

 less small size of the teeth. Had any other form or system of dentition existed, 

 it could therefore scarcely have been overlooked by the distinguished French 

 naturalist. It is with much pleasure that I now submit to Ichthyologists the 

 description of a fish which resembles in almost every feature, the known species 

 of Hcmirhamphus, but which have in each jaw a band of distinctly tricuspidate 

 small teeth. Two specimens are in the collection made by the author, at the 

 island of Barbadoes. Owing to an unfortunate accident, the specimens are in 

 poor condition the scales being mostly rubbed off and the fins more or less 

 broken. I am unable, therefore, to furnish at present as full a discription as 

 could have been wished. 



IIyporhampihts Gill. 



Body elongated, very slowly decreasing in height to the dorsal. Scales large, 

 each with a subcentral nucleus and delicate concentric stria;. Head elongated, 

 conical in profile, broad and flattened above. Lower jaw forming an elongated, 

 slender and depressed bill. Upper jaw short and acutely rounded. Teeth small, 

 distinctly tricuspidate, and with the median cusp largest, in a moderate band 

 on each jaw. Dorsal and anal fins posterior and opposite each other, each 

 oblong and simple. Caudal fin moderate, emarginate. Pectoral fins moderate. 

 Ventral fins subcentral, small or moderate. Ventral carina distinct on each 

 side. Tongue thiD, moderate, rounded anteriorly, with parallel sides, and with 

 a median groove, free before and on the sides. 



H. tricuspidatus, Gill. The greatest height equals an eleventh of the 

 extreme length, from the point of the lower jaw to the end of the caudal fin ; 

 the greatest breadth exceeds three-fifths of the height. The head, inclusive of 

 the lower jaw, forms more than three-tenths of the extreme length. The lower 

 jaw, from the tip to the corner of the mouth, constitutes a fifth of the same 

 length, and is five times larger than the upper jaw. The radial formula ap- 

 pears to vary. In a small specimen it is as follows : D 14, A 17, 'C 4, I 6, 7, 

 14, P 11, V 6. 



In a large one D 15, A 16, P 10. 



They are both too much damaged to retain the true colors. The broad sil- 

 very band is present as usual, and widest posteriorly. The upper part of the 

 dorsal is blackish. 



* I have not been in a position to consult the u Catalogue of Malayan Fish," 

 in the eighteenth volume of the Journal of ihe Asiatic Society of Bengal, where 

 Cantor has described a " Ilemirhamphus tridentifer." That species may possibly 

 belong to the genus now described, although the teeth of Ilyporhamphus would 

 be very improperly compared to tridents. The specific name may, however. 

 only allude to the three denticles of each tooth.

132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



On DACTYLOSCOPTJS and LEPTQSCOPTJS, two New Genera of the Family of 



Uranoscopidae. 

 BY THEO. GILL. 



Dactyloscopus Gill. 



Body elongated, with the dorsal and abdominal outlines slowly converging 

 to the caudal fin. Scales large, regularly imbricated. Lateral line straight, 

 and running along the middle of the side. Head oblong, subcubical and smooth. 

 Preopercle entire, opercle radiatedly fringed behind. Mouth nearly vertical. 

 Tongue thick, narrowed anteriorly, attached to the floor of the mouth. Labial 

 velum without a barbel. Anus a short distance behind the base of the pectoral 

 fins. Dorsal fin subequal, single and very long, commencing above or before 

 the anus, and continued almost to the base of the caudal. Anal fin commen- 

 cing behind the anus, and with the same form and termination as the dorsal. 

 Caudal fin small and narrow, posteriorly subtruncated. Pectoral fins suban- 

 gular. Ventral fins jugular, closely approximated, and each with three stout 

 simple and articulated rays. 



D. tridigitatus Gill. The head from the snout to the margin of the 

 opercle forms about a fifth of the extreme length. 



The greatest height is equal to a seventh of the same. The caudal fin forms 

 an eighth. The dorsal commences over the lower angle of the base of the 

 pectorals, or immediately before the margin of the operculum. 



D 40, A 34, C 1, 5, 5, 1, P 13, V 3. 



The color, as far as preserved, is gray, marbled with white. 



Three specimens were obtained by the describer at the island of Barbadoes. 

 The largest is slightly more than three inches in length. They are all in a bad 

 state of preservation. 



This is a most interesting genus, from the unusual combination of the char- 

 acters which it presents. From all the species that have been hitherto referred 

 to the genus Uranoseopvs, it is at once distinguished by the entire absence of 

 teeth on the palatine arch, and by the presence of only three rays to each of the 

 ventral fins. Notwithstanding these anomalous characters, it presents so close 

 a resemblance in general form to a species that has been described by Sir John 

 Richardson, as Uranoseopvs macropygns, that it might readily be referred to the 

 genus by a casual observer. The same smooth head, the same gradually taper- 

 ing body, the long dorsal and anal continued to the base of the caudal, the re- 

 gularly imbricated scales, the straight and median lateral line, and the fringed 

 operculum, are seen in both genera. In most of these characters, the two 

 fishes are unlike any of the other Uranoscopi. Dactyloscopus is again distinguish- 

 ed from the so-called Uranoscopus macropygus. besides the two characters that 

 have been already pointed out by the relative length of the dorsal and anal fins, 

 and by the relative situation of the ventrals to each other. In the first described 

 by Richardson, the anus is even more forward than in the West Indian species, 

 and the anal fin commences immediately behind. The dorsal begins at some 

 distance behind the nape, and over the sixth or seventh anal ray. The ven- 

 trals are also seperated from each other by a wide interval. In the genus 

 Dactyloscopus the dorsnl commences above the lower angle of the pectorals, and 

 therefore considerably in advance of the anal fin. The ventrals are also closely 

 approximated to each other, and in this respect, resemble the typical Uranos- 

 copi. Uravoscopus macropygus lias a smaller operculum than Dactyloscopus tricli- 

 gi'alus, and this operculum is also triangular and fringed along its upper mar- 

 gin. The former species having been placed in the genus Uranoscopus, it is, of 

 course, to be understood that it is provided with teeth on the vomer and pala- 

 tine bones. As it is advisable that it should be erected into a distinct genus, 

 the name of Leptoscopus is now conferred on it, and the comparative characters 

 of the two genera are herewith given.

The first two characters given in each of the above generic diagnoses, are in 

 this case of more than generic importance. Had either of them existed alone, 

 the genera might possibly have been naturally placed in the same tribe or sub- 

 family. Combined as they are, they appear to be unquestionably the indices 

 of distinct groups. Daclyloscopus is therefore placed as the type of one sub- 

 family, Dactyloscopinee, and Leptoscopus of another Leptoscopince. Notwith- 

 standing the abnormal and blennoid structure of the ventrals, and the absence 

 of the vomerine or palatine teeth, the Dactyloscopines appear to be almost as 

 much related to the Leptoscopince, as the latter are to the Uranoscopina, properly 

 so called. The comparison between the two former has been instituted on 

 account of their close external resemblance, and not because they are believed 

 to be very nearly allied to each other.

Hub. Camma River, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



The present and the preceding species are strictly of the same subgeneric 

 group, and resemble each other in colors and general characters, but the pre- 

 sent bird is strongly characterized by the large space of chestnut color on the 

 breast, which assumes the form of a wide transverse band, and is uniformly 

 presented in several specimens in the collection from the Camma. It is smaller 

 than the preceding. 



This bird seems to be nearly related to Ploceus collaris, Vieillot, Nouv. Diet, 

 xxxiv., p. 129, Ency. Meth. ii. p. 699, but has not the tail feathers black, as 

 stated in all descriptions of that species, nor the breast rufous as stated also, 

 and differs in other characters. It also appears to be related to P. capitalis, 

 Lath. Gen. Hist, vi., pi. 94, but not so closely as to render it necessary to point 

 out distinctive characters.

Ploceus flavigula, Hartl. Rev. Zool., 1845, p. 406.

 Specimens in all of Mr. Duchaillu's collections agreeing precisely with the 

 inscriptions above cited are constantly labelled as males and females of the 

 same species. It is apparently the most abundant bird of this group in Equa- 

 torial Western Africa. Specimens from the Ogobai and Rembo, and formerly 

 from the Muni, Moonda and Cape Lopez.

Two specimens only from the Camma present some differences compared 

 with numerous others in the Acad. Coll. from more northern localities, " Sene- 

 gal," " Gambia," &c, but may not be distinct. A careful investigation might, 

 however, be a good investment for an enterprising ornithologist. 



Jardine's figures, cited above, represent nothing accurately with which I am 

 acquainted, and seem, moreover, to have been prepared from specimens pre- 

 served in alcohol, which is especially liable to change yellow colors. The 

 species may not be the present.

 from the Camma, and formerly from the Moonda. The description and figures 

 by Dr. Hartlaub above cited, are of the female and young male, but the adult 

 male and female and the young are accurately described by him in Orn. W.

 male is restricted to the frontal and other plumage at the base of the bill.

Some exercise of the imagination is required in rating this bird in the same 

 genus as the two preceding. The male is figured as above, and that sex only 

 is represented in the present collection from the Camma. A single specimen 

 was formerly received from the Moonda. 



This bird probably belongs to a group of which, perhaps, Estrelda is the type, 

 and seems to represent a subgenus, or perhaps a genus, certainly quite dis- 

 tinct from Nigrita.

Scarcely of this genus, but more nearly related to the immediately preced- 

 ing. This species is in Dr. MacDowell's collection from St. Paul's river, and 

 it has now been received in several of Mr. Duchaillu's collections. 



Specimens labelled as of both sexes are much alike, and the adult bird is 

 intended to be represented in the plate above cited, but the bill is given too 

 short and entirely erroneously. The bill is somewhat lengthened, with the 

 commissure curved.

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 137 



Of the plumage supposed by me to be the adult female and so labelled in 

 the present collection, there may be an error. It is quite possible that the 

 adult female is black, like the male. The female of this species described 

 above is in general appearance not unlike that of some species of Carpodacus.

Total length about bh inches, wing 2f, tail 2\ inches. Female rather 

 smaller. 



Hab. Equatorial Africa. Rivers Moonda and Camma. (Mr. Duchaillu). 



The adult males of these two species are easily distinguished by the chin, 

 cheeks, and upper tail coverts being black in the first, and scarlet in the second 

 species, though they are very similar in size and general appearance. The 

 young males also are much alike, but that of S. guttata may always be recog- 

 nized by the upper tail coverts being dull red. The females are more difficult 

 to distinguish, both having the upper tail coverts scarlet or red in all ages. In 

 the female of . hamatina, the red color of the cheeks frequently extends over 

 the frontal feathers, completely inclosing the base of the bill, which characters 

 I have never seen in that of S. guttata.

In addition to the preceding species of "Woodpeckers, there are several

 though with a large majority of known African species before me, in the

 has required so much time, that I am under the necessity of abandoning it, 

 without satisfactory conclusions, so far as relates to several species.*

 PI. Enl. 345, fig. 2, but may not be an African bird. It apparently belongs to 

 the same generic group as species labelled "P. affinis,' n " Mesopicus Cecilii,"

Hab. River Ogobai, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu. 



A single specimen labelled as a male of this species is in the collection from 

 the Ogobai, and I have failed to identify it with any species or description 

 which has come under my notice ; nor does it resemble any other species 

 known to me in such degree as to render it necessary to point out comparative 

 distinctions. It seems to belong to the group Palumbus, though it appears 

 to me to approach Carpopkaga more nearly than any species that I have yet 

 seen from Africa, and its general appearance is somewhat like that of the 

 plainer species of that group (C. cineracea, rosacea and others). It is entirely 

 without any white or black collar, or other markings on the neck, and the 

 present specimen has no metallic tint whatever on any part, though having 

 all the characters of an adult bird. 



Though of very plain colors, this is a large and handsome species, and I

Notes on a Collection of Japanese Fishes, made by Dr. J. Morrow. 



BY THEO. GILL. 



The collection of Japanese fishes, which it is now proposed to notice, has 

 been submitted to us by Prof. Baird, of the Smithsonian Institution, and was 

 formed during the expedition to Japan, under the command of Commodore 

 Perry. It contains specimens of eighteen species, six of which are believed to 

 be new. All the remaining, with exception of two species, (Gasterotokeut 

 biaculeatus of Meckel and Amphiprion frenatus, Brevoort,) have been previously 

 described as inhabitants of Japan, by Temminck and Schlegel, in the Ichthyo- 

 logical portion of the Fauna Japonica.

Apistus rubripinnis Tem. and Schl. Fauna Japonica, Pisces, p. 49, pi. xxii. fig. 2. 



Apistus rubripinnis Brevoort, Notes on figures of Japanese Fish, p. 10, ib. in 

 Narrative Expedition to Japan, vol. 2, p. 262, pi. vi. fig. 5. 



This fish belongs to Svvainson's genus Gymnapistes, established for those 

 species of the Ap i s t u s of Cuvier which are destitute of scales, and all of 

 whose pectoral rays on each side are connected by the membrane and form a 

 single entire fin. 



Swainson has entirely perverted the name of Apistus, or Apistes as it is 

 spelled by him, by applying it to Cuvier's genus M i n o u s , which latter name 

 he has probably abolished on account of its barbarous origin. As the barbarity 

 of a name is not sufficient to authorize such an act, M i n o u s must be restored 

 to the genus for which it was first used, and Apistus may be retained for 

 the first Cuvieran section of the group embraced under that name. 



MONOCENTROID/E Gill. 



The peculiar and cavernous nature of the bones of the head and the large 

 osseous shields of the body appear to detach the genus Monocentris from 

 the other families of the Cataphracti.

A single specimen of this fish is in the collection of Dr. Morrow. The figure 

 accompanying the above cited memoir of Mr. Brevoort is a very accurate repre- 

 sentation of its form. In spirits, the plates are of a brown brass color, and the 

 interspaces are blackish. The specimen is of the size figured in the plate. Is 

 there more than one species of the genus ? or does the young differ in form from 

 the adult?

 with white.

An individual of this species, five inches in length, was obtained by Dr. 

 Morrow. 



6. Rhinogobius s i m i 1 i s Gill. This fish has a great superficial resem- 

 blance to Acanthogobius flavimanus, but differs generically in the naked 

 sides of the head and in the normal number of dorsal spines. 



The head is as elongated as that of A. f 1 a v i m a n u s , but is more gibbous 

 between the eyes and jaws ; it forms nearly a quarter of the entire length, in- 

 clusive of the caudal. The eyes are moderately large, and are placed midway 

 between the snout and operculum. There are about twenty-eight scales in a 

 lateral row on the side.

D vi, 1, 7 - A 1, 7 - C 9, 7, 7, 9, P 18, V, 1, 5 + 5, 1. 

 1 1 



The color is tawny, punctured with black above, and darker on the profile 

 and operculum, and there is on each side a row of five large dark spots. The 

 second dorsal is irregularly clouded ; the other fins are immaculate. 



This species would answer quite well to the description of Gobins P f 1 a u m i i 

 of Bleeker, were it not for the elongated form of the head. It agrees with that 

 species in the clear fins and in the number of scales on the sides. 



The genera to which the two Gobinie of this catalogue are referred, are fully 

 described in a Memoir on the Gobinae of the North Pacific Expedition, commu- 

 nicated to the Lyceum of Natural History of New York.

146 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Luciogobius Gill. 



Eody naked, elongated and slender, with the height nearly uniform 

 to he caudal fin, anteriorly cylindrical ; head depressed, above elongated 

 oval swollen on the sides, and with a central linear depression ; eyes 

 widel separated, entirely in the anterior half of the head, small and covered 

 by tb skin ; mouth nearly horizontal, moderately large and extending under 

 the e; es ; teeth pluriserial on the jaw, largest in the external row, not passing 

 to th corner of the mouth ; vomer and palatine toothless; tongue large, free 

 and i eeply emarginated anteriorly : branchial apertures small, nearly vertical 

 and nterior to the bases of the pectorals ; branchiostegals four on each side ; 

 doisal fin nearer the caudal than the head, single and oblong, preceded by 

 one or two simple inarticulated rays ; anal opposite the dorsal ; caudal rounded ; 

 pectorals rounded, with the rays entirely connected by the membrane and with 

 veitical bases ; ventrals small, united in a simple infundibuliform basin, and 

 each composed of a spine and five-branched rays ; interspinal membrane low ; 

 lateral line obsolete. 



This is the type of a very distinct tribe of the Gobioids, well characterized 

 by the esociform position of the dorsal and anal fins, and by the very small 

 number of simple rays. In the latter respect, they are represented in the other 

 families of Acanthopterygians by p h i c e p h a 1 u s , Bl., Aphredoderus, 

 Les., Ichthyoscopus, Sw., Aspidophoroides, Lac, Pseud o- 

 cliromis, Rup., &c. 



In the form of the head it has a slight resemblance to Trimnophorun, Gill. 



7. L. guttatus Gill. The body is much elongated and imperceptibly 

 declines to the caudal fin. The height at the pectorals is between a twelfth 

 and thirteenth of the extreme length, and near the caudal, it is rather more 

 than a seventeenth of the same length. 



The head is oblong oval above ; it forms about two-ninths of the total length ; 

 its breadth equals five-ninths of* the length, and is twice as great as the height. 



The dorsal is situated slightly anteriorly to the sixth-tenth of the extreme 

 length ; it is oblong and sustained by two inarticulate and twelve branched 

 rays. The anal is under the dorsal, and has thirteen rays, the first of which 

 is small and inarticulate. 



The body is brown, thickly punctured with black; the caudal, dorsal and 

 pectoral fins are also dotted with black. 



A single specimen of the length of two inches and a half is in the collection

8. Centronotus s a b f r e n a t u s Gill. This species differs from the pre- 

 viously known Japanese species of the genus C. c r a s s i s p i n n i s , (Gun- 

 nellus crns.nspinnis Temtn. and Schlegel, Fauna Japonica, Pisces, p. 139,) C. 

 nebulosus (Gunnellus nebulosus, T. S. I.e.,) and C. dolichogaster 

 (Gunncllus dolichogaster, Brevoort,) by the presence of an almost vertical band, 

 margined on each side by purplish-whi e, which passes from the lower border 

 of the eye to the margin of the preopercle behind the lower jaw. A widely 

 curved band of purplish-white with a row of black dots passes from eye to 

 eye ; the convexity of the curve is posterior. The body is reddish-brown with 

 a dorsal band of black, and with a la eral row of large confluent black spots. 

 The fins are immaculate, but the posterior margin of the caudal is white. The 

 dorsal has from seventy-six to seventy nine spines. 



Several specimens of this species were obtained by Dr. Morrow, but only one 

 of them is in a good state of preservation. 



As the name of C e n t r o n o t u s was given to the Cuvieran Gunnelli 

 before its application to a Scombroid genus by Lacepede, and subsequently by 

 Mitchell, there is no reason why it should not be retained for the present genus.

10. Cichlops Japonicus Gill. This species scarcely differs in general form 

 from its congeners, and is very nearly allied to the C. cyclop h thai m us of 

 Muller and Troschel. It is chiefly distinguished from that species by the 

 position of the bases of the ventrals, under the lower angles of those of the 

 pectorals. The color is tawny, much darker in the centres of the scales on the 

 back and on the sides above the pectorals. The posterior border of the orbit is 

 margined by a black crescent. The dorsal has a few minute black dots. The 

 membranous margin of the preopercle presents the appearance of being sus- 

 tained by rays. There are about fifty-two scales in a longitudinal row along 

 the sides.

11. Pomacentrus dorsal is Gill. The body is oblong oval, with its abdomi- 

 nal outline more arched than its dorsal. The head is small, and its outline 

 from the nape to the snout is straight. The eye is large and near the profile. 

 The suborbital has a simple, strong tooth directed horizontally backwards, and 

 separated by a semi-elliptical sinus from the body of the bone. The suborbi- 

 tal beneath the eye has also one or two small vertical processes. There are 

 about twenty-five scales in a longitudinal row on the side. 



D xiii. 15, A ii. 15, C 3, 9, 8, 3, or 5, 1, 5, 6, 1, 5, P 18, V i. 5. 



The color is brown, with one or two obscure bluish dots on each posterior 

 scale of the sides. The operculum and preoperculum have a few more distinct 

 ones, and there is also a distinct black dot at the scapular angle of the 

 operculum. A large black spot, bordered anteriorly by bluish white, is on the 

 postericr rays of the dorsal. There is a black dot at the upper angle of the 

 base of the pectoral. The ventrals are purple; the caudal yellow towards 

 the base. 



One specimen is in the collection ; its length is nearly three and a half 

 inches. 



12. Glyphidodon coelestinus. This species does not appear to have 

 been previously found at Japan. Two specimens are in the collection of Dr. 

 Morrow. 



TheG. smaragdinus Brevoortf appears to be quite distinct from this species, 

 if the figure given in the Notes on Japanese Fish is correctly drawn. It is much

higher than G. ccelestinus, the bands are not as distinct, and the first and 

 last ones of G. c oe 1 e s ti n u s are obsolete ; it is still more distinguished by 

 the absence of the longitudinal submarginal black bands of the caudal, so 

 distinct in G. ccelestinus. The number of dorsal spines appears to be the 

 same in both species.

The color of this species, as preserved in alcohol, is very different from 

 that of the living fish. The ground color is tawny. The oblique band behind 

 the eye is purplish white, bordered on each side by black. There are nine 

 spinous rays in the dorsal fin. The groups of radiating opercular ridges 

 terminating in spines, and which are characteristic of the Amphiprion in re, are 

 perfectly distinct, although they are not shown in the above quoted figure. 



Two specimens of the species were collected by Dr. Morrow.

Stnentognathi Gill. 



The abdominal Malacopterygian Pharyngognaths of Dr. Miiller do not 

 appear to belong to the same natural order as the Pomacentroids and 

 allied fishes. If the coalescence or separation of the inferior pharyngeal 

 bones is to be esteemed as of ordinal value, the two sections that have been 

 confounded under the name of Pharyngognathi should be at least separated, and 

 regarded as disiinct orders. In such a case, the above name may be used to 

 embrace the Exocceti, Scomberesoces, &c. There is so striking a 

 parallelism between the genera of Acanthopterygian Pharyngognaths and the 

 true Acanthopterygians, that a doubt may be even entertained whether the 

 pharyngeals are of really ordinal value in classification. Certain it is, that 

 no less than three genera that actually belong to the Pharyngognathi of Miiller, 

 were confounded by Cuvier himself with genera of the Mullerian Acanthopteri, 

 Pterophyllum of Heckel being referred to Platax, Astronotus of 

 Swainson to Lobotes and Amblodon of Rafinesque to C o r v i n a . The 

 connection of those respective genera appears, however, to be one of analogy 

 rather than of affinity. 



Scomberesoces Mull. 



Hemikhamphinje Gill. 



16. Hemirhamphus occipitalis Gill. The height is scarcely contained 

 twelve times in the length from the upper jaw to the end of the caudal fin. The 

 head forms nearly a fifth of the same length, and its height is contained between 

 two and two and a half times in its length. The eyes are large, the diameter 

 of an orbit exceeding a fourth of the length of the head, and equalling the 

 interorbital space. The upper jaw is triangular, longer than wide, and acutely 

 rounded; the distance from the middle of its side to the orbit equals an orbit's 

 diameter. The lower jaw, from the corner of the mouth to the tip, is more 

 than a half greater than the length of the head, and forms a fourth of the 

 extreme length. The dorsal fin commences between the sixth and seventh of 



[April,

the length from the upper jaw to the end of the caudal, and is entirely over 

 the anal. The pectorals, when bent forwards, reach at least to the centre of 

 the pupil. 



D 13, A 14, &c. 



The general color is chocolate brown, with the usual lateral silver band 

 broader between the dorsal and anal. A number of small purplish dots, and 

 a few larger ones, form a triangular area on the occipital region, the apex of 

 which is posterior, and tbe base emarginated : and from the angles of the 

 base, two bands of spots proceed, and converge anteriorly. Above the orbit, 

 there is also a pale bluish area dotted with black. 



A single specimen of this species, little more than four inches in length, is 

 in the same collection. The color is much changed, or, at least, is quite 

 distinct from that of most other species of the genus, but resembles more that 

 of Hemirhamphus Gerncerti of Valenciennes. 



It does not agree with the description of any of tbe known species of the 

 genus. The H. Gernaerti Val. appears to be its nearest ally, but the beak 

 of that species is said to be the fifth of the total length, and no mention i? 

 made of any peculiarity in the coloration of the head. The H. intermedins 

 of Cantor and Richardson differs in the number of rays, in color and in propor- 

 tions. H. S a jo r i of Temminck and Scblegel is distinguished by its short beak. 

 Jn H. japonicus of Brevoort, the anal appears to commence nearly under 

 the middle of the dorsal, and the beak is also shorter. The present appears, 

 therefore, to be undescribed.

Dr. Leidy called attention to specimens of Palseotrochus presented 

 this evening by Prof. E. Emmons, from subsilurian strata : he stated 

 that its organic nature had been denied by able authorities, but con- 

 sidered that its symmetry and uniformity were in favor of its being a 

 fossil; it had most strongly the appearance of a coral. 



Dr. Le Conte had seen a similar body of larger size from the copper- 

 bearing rocks of Point Keewenaw, Lake Superior. He could not con- 

 ceive that such numbers of masses of similar form could arise from 

 molecular action forming concretions.

Description of a Third Genus of HEMIRHAMPHIN.2E, 



BY THEO. GILL. 



After the transmission to the Academy of Natural Sciences of the paper de- 

 scriptive of the genus Ilgporhamphus, Mr. James C. Brevoort placed in my hands 

 a species closely resembling those fishes which have been described as Hemi- 

 rhamphus lo7igirostris and //. macrorht/nchus. Mr. Brevoort at the same time 

 called my attention to the peculiar dentition of the species, there being evidently 

 tricuspidate teeth in the lower jaw, while those in the upper were simply coni- 

 cal. On an examination of the descriptions of the above mentioned species, as 

 given in the " Histoire Naturelle des Poissons," it is to be remarked that no al- 

 lusion is made to the shape of the teeth, but that they are in each described as 

 being very fine, immediately after the statement of the size of the upper jaw. 

 It is then to be presumed that M. Valenciennes only noticed the conical teeth, 

 for one of the characters that he has given of the genus is founded on the 

 presence of granular or conical ones. Could Valenciennes have overlooked the 

 teeth of the lower jaw, and only examined those of the upper? It appears to 

 me possible that he did, for it is scarcely to be believed that a fish so closely 

 resembling Hemirhamphus longirostris as the present species, could differ from 

 it in such important parts. I nevertheless offer this opinion with diffidence. 

 As Valenciennes has remarked, the teeth are very small, and as their forms can 

 only be discerned through a magnifier, they might have been easily overlooked, 

 unless the attention of the observer was particularly attracted to them. The 

 peculiarity of the different structure of the teeth in each jaw would scarcely have 

 been suspected by the naturalist as occurring in this tribe. If this supposition 

 is correct, as to the Hemirhamphus longirostris and H. macrorhynchus, those 

 species should be withdrawn from the genus Hemirhamphus and placed in an 

 allied one. Valenciennes would probably have himself done this, if he had 



1859.] 




156 PROCEEDINGS OiT THE ACADEMY OP 



been aware that any such peculiarity as that signalized had existed. Certain 

 it is, that the species to be now described differs from Hemirhamphus, not only 

 in the dentition, but even more strikingly in general form, which at once dis- 

 tinguishes it from that genus, as it should be restricted, and approximates it 

 to the long billed and slender Hemirhamphus longiroslris. In the typical Ilemi- 

 rhamphi the body, although elongated and nearly uniform, is quite robust. In 

 the present genus (Euleptorhamphus) the proportional height is about half of 

 that in Hemirhamphus, and the beak is also much elongated. The pectorals are 

 again much longer than those of Hemirhamphus, and are pointed at their ex- 

 tremities, and they have been even compared by Valenciennes to those of the 

 Ezocozti. These characters sustain us in the belief that it forms the type of a 

 natural genus, and we now give its generic characters, those appertaining to the 

 subfamily being omitted. 



EOLEPTORHAMPHUS Gill. 



Body very slender and elongated, covered with large and high scales. The 

 eusiform, lower jaw, very long and slender, greatly exceeding the length of the 

 head. Teeth very small and panciserial in each jaw, tricuspidate in the lower 

 and subconical in the upper. Pectoral fins elongated and pointed. Anal with 

 all its rays, except the most anterior, simply branched. 



EULEPTORHAMPHUS BrEVOORTII Gill. 



The height between the vertical fins is contained between twelve and thirteen 

 times in the length from the opercular margin to the base of the caudal fin. 

 The head, from the end of the upper jaw to the margin of the operculum bears 

 a proportion to the length of the trunk of one to six and a third. The beak 

 forms about three-tenths of the extreme length inclusive of the caudal fin. 



The eye is moderate, its diameter forming little, if at all, more than a fourth 

 of the head's length (exclusive of the beak). The interorbital space is equal 

 to a diameter. The pectorals slightly exceed three-elevenths of the length 

 of the trunk. The ventrals are nearer to the margin of the operculum than to 

 that of the caudal fin, and are very small, their length only equalling a sixth of 

 the pectorals. The dorsal commences nearer to the point of the caudal than to 

 the bases of the pectorals ; its base is about as long or even longer than the 

 length of the pectorals ; about three of its rays are in advance of the anal, and 

 its last ray is above or a little behind that of the same fin. 



In the number of rays this species does not differ essentially from its con- 

 geners. 



P 22 ; A 22 ; C 3, I, 8, 9, I, 5 ; P 8 ; V 6. 



The scales appear to be firmly adherent to the body, especially on the silvery 

 portion. The color is tawny-yellow on the back and inferiorly on the tail ; 

 the head and the rest of the sides are brilliant silvery ; the silvery band is 

 quite straight above ; the beak is light or tawny-brown. 



It appears that Euleptorhamphus Brevoortii is consequently more nearly allied 

 to E. longiroslris of Ouvier than to the E. macrorhynehus, the former offering no 

 important difference in its relative height, which is said to be comprised thir- 

 teen times in the trunk, measured from the operculum to the root of the tail ; 

 in E. macrorhynehus the height is not comprised much more than nine times in 

 the same length. With the latter, it is therefore unnecessary to compare the 

 present species ; from the former, it appears to differ specifically in some of its 

 proportions. The beak in E. longirosttis is said to be a quarter of the entire 

 length ; in E. Brevoortii it is three-tenths, or a little less than a third, and is 

 consequently almost as long proportionally as E. macrorhynehus. The eye in E. 

 longirostris is a third of the head's length in diameter ; in E. Brevoortii it is only 

 a quarter. The other variations in dimensions would not be sufficient to speci- 

 fically distinguish the two fishes, but as they do not very widely differ in size, 

 the variations that have been stated appear to be specific and not the results of

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 157 



age. Valenciennes says that the scales ofE. longirostris appeared to him to 

 fall easily. The scales ofE.Brevoortii appear to me to be more than usually 

 adherent. If we are both correct, this difference will be important as specific. 

 The two fishes finally appear to differ in color, but the one that has been above 

 described has been apparently long preserved in alcohol. 



The habitat of this species is unknown ; the species allied to it have been 

 hitherto found only in the Oriental seas. 



ICHTH YOLOGICAL NOTICES. 

 BY CHARLES GIRARD, M. D. 



LX. A species of Fundulus, closely allied to F grandis, and of which we have 

 given a good figure of either sex, on Plate xxxvi of the "Ichthyology of the 

 United States and Mexican Boundiy, " was recently collected in Charlotte Bay, 

 Fla., and sent to the Smithsonian Institution. 



The specimens obtained are of the male sex, the largest one measures four 

 inches and a half in total length, the head forming a little more than the 

 fourth of it. The eye is large and circular, the diameter of the orbit entering 

 about four times in the length of the side of the head. The maxillar teeth are 

 rather small and inconspicuous. The body has not the plump appearance of 

 F. grandis ; its greatest depth is less than the fourth of the total length. The 

 dorsal and anal fins are narrower than in F. grandis. The anterior margin of 

 the anal is nearer the posterior margin of the caudal than the apex of the snout; 

 that of the anal is equidistant between the pupil and the margin of the caudal. 

 The latter is rounded off or subtruncated. The anal is inserted somewhat 

 more anteriorly with reference to the dorsal than in F. grandis, and the tips of 

 the rays of the dorsal project a little further than those of the anal fin. The 

 ventrals are possibly smaller than in F. grandis, their extremities not reaching 

 quite the vent. The pectorals are of moderate size and extend as far back as a 

 vertical line drawn at the origin of the ventrals. The rays are : D 12 ; A 11 ; 

 C 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2; V 6 ; P 1, 16. The scales are deeper than long, but propor- 

 tionally less so than in F. grandis. The head, dorsal region and flanks are 

 blackish brown, metallic white spots being scattered over the sides of the body 

 and tail. The abdomen is yellowish white The dorsal, caudal, and anal fins 

 olivaceous, checkered with black and white, the ventrals and pectorals being 

 olivaceous. 



The name of Fundulus floridensis is bestowed upon this species. 



LXI. We owe to our friend Dr. Thomas Webb, a species of Cyprinodon, col- 

 lected by him in the neighborhood of San Diego, Cal., while attached to the U. 

 S. and Mexican Boundary, under ex-Commissioner P.. R. Bartlett. 



It may easily be distinguished from its congeners in North America, by its 

 uniform system of coloration which exhibits neither bands nor spots. The 

 general aspect of its body is rather short and deep, except in the young which 

 assume a subfusiform appearance. The largest specimens which we have ex- 

 amined measure about an inch and a half in total length. The head consti- 

 tutes the fourth of the length, the snout being abruptly rounded off. The 

 mouth is, proportionally speaking, of medium size ; whilst the eye is rather small, 

 subcircular ; its diameter entering three times and a half in the length of the 

 side of the head. The dorsal fin is higher than long, and superiorly convex ; 

 its anterior margin being nearer the apex of the snout than the posterior margin 

 of the caudal. The anal fin is nearly as large as the dorsal, deeper than long, 

 inferiorly convex, particularly upon its posterior half. The caudal is poste- 

 riorly truncated, nearly linear. The ventrals are small, project beyond the 

 vent and reach almost the origin of the anal. The pectorals are well developed, 

 rounded off, extending as far as a vertical line drawn at the insertion of the 

 ventrals. The rays are : D 10 + 1 ; A 11 ; C 3, 1, 8, 8, 1, 3 ; V 7 ; P 12. The

scales are much deeper than long, anteriorly truncated and posteriorly rounded 

 off or convex. The color is olivaceous brown, with a dark greyish tint along 

 the back, and a golden tint beneath. 



We propose calling this species Cyprinodon calif orniensis. 



LXII. Another Cyprinodon, the largest species so far observed in North 

 America, was collected by Mr. John Potts, in Chihuahua river. Specimens of 

 the male sex measure two inches and a half in total length. The head, which 

 constitutes somewhat more than the fourth of the total length, is rather large, 

 the snout being abbreviated and rounded off. The eye is of moderate develop- 

 ment, since its diameter enters four times in the length of the side of the head. 

 The mouth is of medium size. The dorsal region between the nape and the 

 origin of the dorsal fin is very convex ; the depth, measured across the latter 

 region, is a good deal more than the third of the total length. The origin of 

 the dorsal fin is nearer the insertion of the caudal fin than the apex of the 

 snout, the fin itself is higher than long, superiorly convex, the first and second 

 rays being the shortest. The posterior margin of the caudal is subtruncated. 

 The anal has the same shape and structure as the dorsal, but is a much smaller 

 fin. The ventrals overlap the vent, reaching almost the anterior margin of the 

 anal. The pectorals are well developed, rounded off, and extend further back 

 than a vertical line drawn at the insertion of the ventrals. The rays are : D 

 12 ; A 12 ; C 5 1, 7, 7, 1, 4 ; V 6 ; P 14. The body of the female sex is not so 

 deep as in the male, although the dorsal region is convex, resembling some- 

 what C. macidarius, figured on plate xxxvii, of the Ichthyology of the United 

 States and Mexican Boundary Survey. The dorsal and anal fin are likewise 

 much smaller than in the male and composed each of eleven rays instead of 

 twelve ; the upper edge of the dorsal being sublinear instead of being convex. 



The ground color is olivaceous yellow with a golden reflect, much brighter 

 beneath than above, where a greyish tint predominates. The adult male is 

 nearly unicolor ; the base of the caudal fin above is speckled with black, 

 whilst its posterior margin is jet black. In its immature condition the male 

 sex exhibits transverse fascise of blackish brown like the female, which is 

 moreover maculated along the flanks. The base of the caudal is likewise 

 speckled in the female, but the posterior edge of its caudal is not margined 

 with black. On the other hand, a black spot may be seen at the posterior por- 

 tion of the dorsal with specks of the same tint along its base. 



We have bestowed the name of Cyprinodon eximius upon the species which 

 is here described. 



LXIII. The sun fish described by S. F. Baird, under the name of Pomotis 

 chcetodon, in the ninth annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithson- 

 ian Institution, 1855, 324, possessing all the generical features which we have 

 lately assigned to the genus Bryttus in the report upon the fishes collected 

 during the various Pacific Railroad Surveys, that species we shall henceforwards 

 call Bryttus choztodon. 



LXIV. The Atlantic coast of the United States furnished a small herring, which 

 was first indicated by Mitchill under the name of Clupea teres. DeKay, in his 

 Fauna of the State of New York, has placed it in the genus Alosa. We have 

 examined a series of specimens of that fish, collected by S. F. Baird, along the 

 coast of New Jersey. The largest ones measure about four inches and a half 

 in total length ; all of them in the most perfect state of preservation. Find- 

 ing teeth upon the maxillar bones, the tongue, the palatines, and the ptery- 

 goidians, whilst the vomer is toothless, we propose referring that species to 

 the genus Harengula of Prof. Valenciennes, established in the " Histoire 

 Naturelle des poissons " upon the characters just alluded to, and to call it 

 Harengxda teres. 

 LXV. The fresh water siluroid, described by Lesueur under the name of 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 159 



Pimelodus lemniscalus, in the "Memoires du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle," 

 belongs, truly speaking, to the genus Noturus of Rafinesque, and which was at 

 one time supposed of being founded upon young specimens of Pimelodi, but is 

 now admitted to be a distinct genus, although resembling in its full grown 

 condition the immature state of Pimelodus, properly so called. The genus 

 Noturus is thus made to include a second species under the name of N. Jerri' 

 niscatus. We venture to say that Lesueur's specimens were procured in Penn- 

 sylvania, and not in the southern States, as assumed by Dekay. 



LXVI. The fish described by F. B. Hough, under the name of Pimelodus 

 gracilis, in the Fifth Ann. Rep. of the Reg. of the Univers. of N. Y., 1852, p. 

 26, is a very characteristic species, but its specific name is unfortunately pre- 

 occupied in the genus Pimelodus. We propose, therefore, to designate it in 

 future under the appellation of Pimelodus houghi. We have examined speci- 

 mens collected at Sommerville, St. Lawrence Co., N. Y. by Mr. Hough himself ; 

 others from Foxburgh, Pa., collected by S. F. Baird ; and others still, from 

 Ogdensburg : they are all preserved in the Museum of the Smithsonian Insti- 

 tution. 



LXVII. Dr. Hoy has collected in the neighborhood of Racine, Wis., speci- 

 mens of a species of Pimelodus, which we propose dedicating to him ; hence 

 calling it P. hoyi. The head constitutes a little less than the fourth of the 

 total length, its upper aspect being longer than broad. The upper jaw is some- 

 what longer than the lower one. The eyes are of medium size ; their diameter 

 entering six times and a half in the length of the side of the head, and four 

 times in the interocular space. The anterior margin of the dorsal fin is nearer 

 the apex of the snout than the origin of the adipose fin. The caudal is slightly 

 emarginated, subcrescentic upon its posterior margin ; it constitutes the sixth 

 of the whole length of the fish. The anal fin is deep and rounded off upon its 

 exterior margin ; its base is somewhat less than the fifth of the entire length. 

 The formula of the rays is : D I, 7 ; A 23 ; C 2, 1, 7, 7, 1, 3 ; V 8 ; P I, 9. 

 The specimens observed measure about a foot in total length ; their coloration 

 is of that uniform type common to various species. 



LXVIII. Specimens of a species, more closely allied in its general appear- 

 ance to P. hoyi than any other of its congeners, were caught in Root River, 

 near Racine, Wis., by S. F. Baird. 



The head forms a little more than the fourth of the total length ; its upper 

 aspect is as broad as long. The jaws are equal. The eyes are of medium size, 

 their diameter being contained eight times in the length of the side of the head, 

 and four and a half times along the interocular space. The anterior margin of 

 the dorsal fin is nearer the origin of the adipose than the apex of the snout. 

 The caudal fin, which constitutes the sixth of the total length, is subcrescentic 

 upon its posterior margin. The anal fin is deep and rounded off exteriorly ; its 

 base being contained five and a half times in the entire length. The rays are: 

 D I, 6 ; A 20 ; 3,1,8,8,1,4; V 8 ; P I, 9. 



We propose calling this species Pimelodus confinis. 



LXIX. A small species having the general appearance of Pimelodus cupreus 

 of Rafinesque, was collected by Robert Kennicott, Aux Plaines, 111. The chief 

 distinguishing mark between the two species consists in the relative length of 

 the jaws, the lower one in P. cupreus being shorter than the upper, whilst they 

 are both equal in the species here alluded to, and which we call P. cupreoides. 

 The head forms a little less than the fourth of the total length ; it is as long as 

 broad, and rounded off upon the snout. The eyes are of medium size : their 

 diameter being contained seven times in the length of the side of the head, and 

 about four times along the interocular space. The anterior margin of the dor- 

 sal fin is nearer the snout than the adipose. The caudal is posteriorly rounded 

 off, formiug a little less than the sixth of the entire length, and shorter than 



1859.] 




160 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



the base of the anal, which enters in the total length somewhat more than four 

 limes only. 



The color is of a uniform, dark blackish-brown tint. 



LXX. The cat fish figured and described by DeKay, under the name of 

 Pimelodus catus, Ctrv. and Val., belongs to a species quite distinct from the 

 one just alluded to. The head forms a little more than the fourth of the 

 whole length : it is broader than long. The lower jaw is longer than the upper. 

 The eyes are rather small ; their diameter entering about nine times in the 

 length of the side of the head, and five and a half times across the interocular 

 space. The anterior margin of the dorsal fin is equidistant between the apex 

 of the snout and the anterior margin of the adipose. The caudal, which forms 

 about the sixth of the total length, is stibtruncated posteriorly. The base of 

 the anal enters likewise six times in the total length. 



This species might be called P. dekayi ; the specimens observed were col- 

 lected at Oswego, Lake Ontario, and in foitr mile creek, near Oswego, by S. F. 

 Baird. 



LXXI. The true Pimelodus catus is a southern species, widely distinct from 

 the above. It can be distinguished by the following characters : the head is 

 contained four times and a half in the entire length ; it is as long as broad, the 

 length being taken from snout to occiput. The jaws are equal. The eyes are 

 small ; their diameter enters also nine times in the length of the side of the 

 head, and five and a half times across the interocular region. The anterior 

 margin of the dorsal fin is nearer the apex of the snout than the origin of the 

 adipose. The caudal is posteriorly rounded off, and contained five and a half 

 times in the total length. The base of the anal enters but four times in the 

 same length. 



LXXII. The hydrographic basin of the Chesapeake has furnished a species of 

 cat fish, popularly known as the " Channel cat," or " Mud cat." The head, 

 which is longer than broad, forms a little less than the fourth of the total 

 length. The upper jaw is somewhat longer than the lower one. The eyes are 

 rather large ; their diameter being contained seven times in the length of the 

 side of the head, and four times and a half across the interocular space. The 

 anterior margin of the dorsal fin is equidistant between the apex of the snout 

 and the origin of the adipose. The posterior edge of the caudal is moderately 

 emarginated ; the fin it3elf constituting not quite the sixth of the total length. 

 The base of the anal is somewhat shorter than the dorsal. The rays are : D I, 

 5 4-1; A 20 ; C 3, 1, 8, 1, 1, 4 ; V 8 ; PI, 9. The upper regions are bluish 

 black, whilst the abdomen is whitish. Specimens were obtained in the Potomac 

 river, in deep run, a tributary of Patapsco river, and at Carlisle, Pa. 



We propose the name of Pimelodus lynx for this species. 



LXXIII. Another species, to which we apply the name of Pimelodus puma, was 

 collected by myself in Charleston, S. C. The head constitutes the fourth of the 

 entire length; it is also longer than broad. The jaws are equal. The eyes are 

 of medium size; their diameter entering about eight times in the length of the 

 side of the head, and five times across the interocular space. The posterior 

 margin of the dorsal is equidistant between the apex of the snout and the 

 posterior flap of the adipose. The caudal is subconvex posteriorly; it con- 

 stitutes about the sixth of the total length. The base of the anal does not 

 enter quite four times and a half in the total length. 



LXXIV. We have likewise collected in Charleston, S. C, a cat fish, the general 

 form of which is more slender than that of the preceding species ; the anal fin 

 is deeper and the caudal emarginated : features which will at once differentiate 

 the species to which we give here the name of Pimelodus vulpeculus. The head, 

 which is longer than broad, constitutes the fourth of the total length. The 

 lower jaw is somewhat shorter than the upper one. The eyes are of medium

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 161 



size: their diameter being contained about eight times in the length of the side 

 of the head, and four times only across the interocular space. The anterior 

 margin of the dorsal ia somewhat nearer the apex of the snout than the adipose, 

 which is smaller and inserted more anteriorly than in P. puma. The caudal fin 

 enters five times and a half in the total length. The base of the anal is equal 

 to the length of the caudal. 



LXXV. A most characteristic species of cat fish has been collected in the neigh- 

 borhood of Anderson, S. C. ; specimens of which having been secured by Mrs. 

 Daniel, were sent to Prof. S. F. Baird nearly eight years ago. The head which 

 is longer than broad, is very much depressed, and contained about four time3 

 in the total length. The mouth is exceedingly broad and large ; the jaws being 

 equal. The eyes are large ; their diameter entering six times and a half in the 

 length of the side of the head, and three and a half times across the interocular 

 space. The anterior margin of the dorsal fin is nearer the apex of the snout 

 than the adipose fin. The caudal is posteriorly emarginated, and constitutes 

 the sixth of the total length. The base of the anal is somewhat longer than 

 the caudal. 



In calling this species Pimelodus platycephalus, allusion is made to its most 

 conspicuous character. 



LXXVI. Specimens of a cat fish, collected in the Black Warrior and Bigsby 

 rivers, Ala., were sent to the Smithsonian Institution by Prof. A. Winchell. The 

 head is contained five times and a half in the entire length. The caudal fin is 

 somewhat longer than the head. The eyes are very large ; their diameter being 

 contained but three times in the length of the side of the head : once in ad- 

 vance and once behind the orbit. The maxillar barbels extend beyond the 

 middle of the length of the pectorals. The base of the anal fin enters four 

 times in the total length of the fish. The rays are : Br. vm : ix ; D I, 6 ; A 28 ; 

 C 10, 1, 7, 8, 1, 10 ; V 8; P I, 9. The dorsal region is of a pale red; the sides 

 of the tail are silvery ; the abdomen is whitish. Brown small spots and dots 

 are occasionally scattered over the body. The maxillar barbels are blackish. 



The name of Pimelodus megalops, refers to the development of the eyes ; 

 although other species may possess a similar feature to a lesser degree. 



LXXVII. Finally we owe to Jas. Fairie, specimens of a cat fish collected by 

 himself at Prairie mer Rouge, La. The species beiDg new, we call it Pimelodus 

 graciosus. It has the general appearance of the preceding species, but the- eyes 

 are much smaller; their diameter entering four times in the length of the side 

 of the head. The head itself forms the fifth of the total length. The anterior 

 margin of the dorsal fin is nearer the apex of the snout than the origin oS the 

 adipose. The tip of the ventral fins extend beyond the origin of the anal. 

 The rays are : Br. vi : vi ; D I, 6 ; A 28 ; C 5, 1, 7, 8, 1, 6 ; V 8 ; P I, 9. The 

 color is reddish brown above ; the vertical fins are margined with black. The 

 abdomen is yellowish ; the horizontal fins being unicolor. The maxillar barbels 

 are greyish black; the submaxillar ones are yellow.

 And were referred to Committees. 



Dr. Leidy directed the attention of the Academy to a number of interesting 

 fossils left by Prof. Emmons for the inspection of the members. 



One of the specimens is the ramus of a lower jaw of a small insectivorous 

 mammal. The Dromatherium sylvestre Emmons, from the coal of 

 Chatham Co., N. C. It is of very great interest, as being the oldest known relic 

 of a mammal. A second specimen, less well preserved, is presented this 

 evening to the Academy by Prof. Emmons. 



Other fossils consist of teeth, vertebrae, and fragments of other bones of 

 Clepsysaurus, Rutiodon and Palseosaurus, also from Chatham 

 Co., N. C. 



There is also a good suite of the curious subsilurian fossil Palaeotrochus, 

 of which some of the specimens are detached, while others are imbedded in the 

 quartzose rock. 



Dr. L. further noticed a very large tooth, much mutilated and black in color, 

 which was discovered by Prof. Emmons, in association with ear bones of 

 cetacea. in the miocene deposits of North Carolina. The tooth probably also 

 belongs to a cetacean, for which the name of Ontocetus Emmonsi is 

 proposed. 



The tooth is curved conical, and is compressed and fluted laterally. In its 

 perfect condition it has been over ten inches in length, by about four inches in 

 its greater diameter, and two and a half inches wide. It is composed of dentine, 

 with an exterior comparatively thin layer of cement, and an interior compara- 

 tively large amount of osteo-dentine. The specimen appears to have lain 

 long exposed to the attacks of living mollusks at the bottom of the miocene 

 ocean, as it exhibits a number of excavations made by pholades or other allied 

 genera. 



Professor Emmons, at the meeting of May 2^th, remarked that the debitu- 

 menization of coal ws effected through the agency of heat, but he does not 

 think that the debilumenization of anthracite is due to heat emanating from 

 an incandescent body, whether that body be injected trap or other pyrocrys- 

 talline rocks. In his opinion the heat which debitumenized the coal of the 

 anthracite region was disengaged or generated by the collision of the rocks 

 enclosing it at the time of their upheaval. In support of this view he referred 

 to the correlation of forces the equivalent of heat, etc. and stated he found 

 by experiment, a year ago, that the volatile matter of the bitumenous slates of 

 North Carolina began to come off at 350, and that it was all driven off para- 

 phine, and all about 608. Hence he inferred that coals are debitumenized at 

 low temperatures, and that intense ignition is not required. 



Professor Rogers objected to these views, and suggested that the non-con- 

 ducting property of the rocks was an obstacle to the theory. 



Mr. Lea, in accordance with a request made at a previous meeting, 

 read the following notice of the late Alexander von Humboldt: 



When one of the great luminaries of the scientific world has passed away, it 

 is usual to take some notice of the loss sustained by those who were accustom- 

 ed to benefit by the labors and instruction of the departed philosopher. It is 

 rarely, very rarely, that science has been deprived of a mind so rich in various 

 branches of human knowledge, as that of Alexander Von Humboldt, a native 

 of Prussia, but belonging to the whole world of civilization. In what town or 

 hamlet, where the European languages are understood, has not his name been 

 familiar? Where has he not imparted new ideas to the inquiring mind? 



Born in 1769, a year remarkable for the biith of many of the most distin-

guished men of the 18th century, viz., Cuvier, Scott, Bonaparte, Wellington, 

 Schiller, Canning and Chateaubriand, few of them have left a more indelible 

 mark than our associate. 



His early travels brought him to this city more than half a century since, and 

 before the foundation of our own Academy, of which he was made a '^correspon- 

 dent" in 1843. 



Born in the highest rank of society with all the advantages of political pre- 

 ferment, he chose to labor in the walks of science. The friend of sovereigns, 

 he was also the friend of the poorest student in the pursuit of knowledge. He 

 was the same philosopher in the palace as in the humble hut. No man had 

 greater advantages no one had made better use of them. Unceasing in his 

 scientific explorations, he exposed himself to the greatest hardships in his 

 voyages and travels, at times braving the deadly malaria and the burning heats 

 of the tropics, then scaling the summits of mountains before considered inacces- 

 sible to man. From these scenes he returned only to work up his abundant 

 materials, which were more extensive and better selected than any before 

 made; and this has been done in the most erudite manner and for the most 

 useful purposes. His books and essays, which he leaves as a rich inheritance 

 to the learned of all countries, will prove to be an immortal monument of his 

 devotion to and his pre-eminence in science. 



All countries claim him because he labored for all, and he fraternised with 

 all their men of science. Of as easy access to the student of nature as to the 

 most learned, he was amiable, courteous and generous. Well aware of what 

 science was doing to promote the welfare and happiness of man, he, during the 

 period of his long life, faithfully worked out his part without ostentation or 

 pride. He loved his studies for their own sake, and in his brilliant intelligence 

 most anxiously diffused that knowledge which he had acquired by his own 

 great labors. 



He was educated chiefly at Gottingen, under Blumenbach and other distin- 

 guished professors. Subsequently he studied under the great Werner, who 

 gave such an impulse to geology towards the end of the last century. The 

 eminent Von Buch only recently dead, an associate of our Academy since 

 1840 became his intimate friend. In 1799 he sailed from Spain with his 

 fides Achates, Bonpland, and explored the rivers, mountains and plains of South 

 America. Returning to Europe in 1804, he proceeded to Paris, where he re- 

 mained until 180V, and published the "Voyage to the Equinoctial Regions of 

 the New Continent." Here he formed those intimate associations with his 

 co-laborers, Cuvier, Arago, Gay-Lussac, Latreille, &c, which he valued so 

 highly, and here he commenced his "Cosmos." Eventually he took up his 

 permanent residence in Berlin in 1847, avoiding all political preferment, but 

 remaining in close intimacy with his sovereign, who was a learned man, and 

 his personal friend, and valuing his society so much, he desired to have it daily 

 when it suited the philosopher's convenience. 



When I had the pleasure to see .our illustrious associate in Berlin, in the 

 summer of 1853, he was iu his 84th year, but still rapid in his thoughts and 

 active in his movements. He was then deeply engaged in the last volume of 

 his "Cosmos," parts of which he showed to me, and expressed his great inter- 

 est in the advance that science was making in the United States. This he 

 spoke of with great warmth, and I had reason to believe that he felt a strong 

 partiality to Americans. In this he united with the general German 

 sentiment. 



Humboldt was beloved and venerated by the population of Berlin and 

 Potsdam, and he was followed to the grave by all that was great and good in 

 the Capital of Prussia. 



In conclusion I offer the following reolutions: 



Resolved, That in the decease of our "Correspondent" Baron Alexan- 

 der Von Humboldt, we lose a scientific brother of no ordinary fame, and

one who, for nearly three-fourths of a century, had led in many branches of 

 philosophy and useful learning. 



Resolved, That we recognise no boundaries, no political or civil divisions in 

 philosophy, but consider our eminent, distinguished and learned associate as 

 belonging to us, as well as to the whole scientific world ; and we are deeply 

 sensible of the irreparable loss we have all sustained in being deprived of his 

 further labors. 



Resolved, That his illustrious example ought to spur us on to the scientific 

 development of his favorite working field the Western Continent and although 

 we no longer have his presence to cheer us on, we will not slacken in our en- 

 deavors to elucidate the Natural History, the Geology and Physical condition 

 of our continent. 



The resolutions were then adopted. 



The following resolutions were adopted : 



That the thanks of the Academy be tendered to Mrs. Sarah R. G. 

 Beck for her valuable donation to the Library, presented this evening. 



That the thanks of the Academy be tendered to the executors of the

BY THEO. GILL. 



Ceratocottus Gill. 



Body anteriorly robust, and as broad or broader than high ; thence rapidly 

 declining to the caudal fin. Lateral line with a row of bony scutellse. Head 

 large, with the width greater than the height or length ; profile vertical; pre- 

 opercle and suborbital extended outwards and forwards ; preopercle armed 

 with a long and immoveable spine, and with two smaller ones beneath ; opercle 

 with a muricated longitudinal rib and with a rounded membranous margin ; 

 subopercle with two diverging ridges terminating in spines ; postorbital ridge 

 well developed and elevated near the nape. Branchial apertures separated by 

 a very wide isthmus. Branchiostegal rays six. Mouth moderate, horizontal. 

 Dorsal fins entirely disconnected ; first low and declining posteriorly ; second 

 oblong and corresponding to the anal. Caudal small and posteriorly subtrun- 

 cated. Pectorals with broad and oblique bases, and with obliquely rounded 

 margins. Ventrals small, moderately approximated, behind the bases of the 

 pectorals ; each with a spinous and three simple rays. 



This genus is very closely allied to the Aspicotius of Girard, or Clypeocottut 

 of Ayres, but is easily distinguished by the form of the head, and by the absence 

 of teeth on the anterior portion of the vomer. The latter character has been 

 overlooked by both Ouvier and Bennett, who have both described the species 

 on which the genus is founded, and have referred it to Coitus, although one of 

 the characters which Cuvier has assigned to that genus, rested on the presence 

 of vomerine teeth. 



A single species of this genus is known ; it was long since described by Pal- 

 las under the name of Cottus diceraus.

Boreocottus Gill. 



Body subcjlindrical, rapidly declining to the caudal fin. Skin mostly naked, 

 or with small and distant tubercles above the lateral line. Lateral line open- 

 ing on the sides through small distant pores. Head large, depressed and sub- 

 rhomboidal ; nasal spines small ; preopercle with two simple spines near the 

 angle and two tubercles below ; opercle with a longitudinal rib terminating in 

 a spine, and with a rounded membranous margin ; subopercle with a spine 

 directed downwards. Postorbital longitudinal crests little developed. Mouth 

 moderate. Teeth villiform, present on each jaw and on the front of the vomer. 

 Branchiostegal membrane continuous under the throat, but attached along the 

 middle of its length almost to its margin, and thus nearly restricting the bran- 

 chial apertures to their respective sides. Branchiostegal rays six. Dorsals 

 separate ; the first low, highest at the middle. Ventrals small, moderately ap- 

 proximated and behind the pectorals ; each with a spine and three soft rays. 



B. axillaris Gill. The color is purplish-blue, with whitish spots on the 

 trunk, and with a darker band-like spot below the anterior portion of the second 

 dorsal. The abdomen is whitish-yellow ; the tail above the anal dotted, and 

 higher up with dark spots confluent with the deep color of the sides. The first 

 dorsal has two vertical dark bands ; the second, three oblique ones. The caudal 

 is blackish at the base and vertically banded with an undulating dark band at 

 its posterior third. The anal has a very irregular row of spots. The pectorals 

 are dark near the base, and have two oblique irregular bands on the posterior 

 half, and a dark spot at their inferior axillae.

One specimen caught with the Porocottus quadrifilis Gill, was obtained 

 Behring's Straits. 



Boreocottus is especially distinguished by its subrhomboidal head, sim- 

 ple preopercular spines, vomerine teeth and six branchial rays. 



Porocottus Gill. 



Body anteriorly subcylindrical, rapidly declining to the caudal. Skin naked- 

 Lateral line opening by pores in raised papillae, under a cutaneous keel. Head 

 large and depressed, subrhomboidal. Nasal spines small. Preopercle with a 

 single hooked spine. Opercle without a longitudinal rib or spine. Large pores 

 under the lower jaw and on various parts of the head. Mouth moderate. Teeth 

 on the jaws and front of the vomer. Branchiostegal membrane continuous un- 

 der the throat, but attached along the middle to the throat, almost as far as the 

 margin. Branchiostegal rays five. Dorsals separate ; the first low; the second 

 oblong and opposite the anal. Ventrals small, behind the pectorals, each with 

 a spine and three soft rays. 



The Porocotti have a strong resemblance to the Boreocotti, but are 

 distinguished by the naked skin, hooked preopercular spine, the absence of a 

 longitudinal rib on the opercle, numerous pores, and the presence of only five 

 branchiostegal rays. 



P. quadrifilis Gill. The color is purple, irregularly spotted with black. 

 There is a dark spot under the eye, and another on the maxillary. The dorsals, 

 caudal and pectorals are irregularly variegated with black. On the pectorals 

 there is a dark spot at the upper axilla, and another larger one towards the 

 middle of the base. There is a slender superciliary filament and one on each 

 side of the nape. It is to the presence of these that the specific name is 

 designed to draw attention.

Descriptions of a New Species of CALLIANIDEA Ed. 

 BY THEO. GILL. 



CALLIANIDEA LiEVICAUDA Gill. 



The rostrum is equilaterally triangular, obtuse, and the carapace curved out- 

 wards from its base; the carapace over the external antenna? projects abruptly, 

 and is separated from the margin above by a short fissure ; the antero-lateral 

 margins of the carapace are abruptly extended outwards, and thence curved 

 obliquely downwards and posteriorly. 



The large cheliped is smooth and polished, and is about twice as long as the 

 carapace. The ischium is compressed and dilated anteriorly, with the articula- 

 ting surface for the meros oblique and scarcely emarginate ; the meros is nearly 

 a third longer than the ischium, subovate, flat internally, convex externally 

 above with its inferior margin anteriorly tridenticulate and hairy ; the carpus 

 is vertical, twice as high as long, and with its posterior side internally inter- 

 secting the anterior; its posterior articulating process is about as long as 

 broad, and is divided into two unequal parts by a wide groove on its inner side ; 

 it projects acutely below, and is there tridenticulate ; the manus is oblong, three 

 times longer than the carpus, with parallel borders : its intero-superior border 

 is provided with a long row of hairs, and its superior surface has a few distant 

 fascicles of hair; the inferior margin is crenulated, and there is on each side a 

 row of fascicles of hair ; the digital process of the manus is about two -thirds as 

 long as the manus itself, and it has five tubercles at its posterior half, the anterior 

 of which is largest ; anterior to this it is crenulated, as are also the margins on 

 each side ; the dactylus is moderately curved anteriorly, and crosses the digital 

 process of the manus, leaving a hiatus; above, it is rounded, with a row of 

 hairs on each side, the interior of which is very dense; below, the external 

 margin of the cochleariform excavation is anteriorly crenulated, succeeded by a 

 moderate tubercle, and posteriorly with two large ones, the posterior of which 

 is rather an elevated apophysis ; the internal border is anteriorly crenulated ; a 

 few pits with fascicles of hair are between the ridges of the cochleariform exca- 

 vation and on each side. 



The first pair of maxillipeds are smooth and polished on their external sur- 

 faces, and their internal margins are ciliated with long hairs. On the internal 

 surface of the ischium there is a longitudinal, distinctly pectiniform ridge ; the 

 meros, carpus and manus have each a longitudinal row of hairs on their inner 

 surface. The ischium is very slightly curved, and its margins are nearly paral- 

 lel. The meros is shorter, with an oblique tooth internally on its anterior third, 

 and thence more slender. The carpus is slender at its base, and internally very 

 convex at its anterior half. The manus is narrowed from near the base to its 

 termination. The dactylus is widest at the middle, and anteriorly rounded. 



The exognath of the outer maxilliped extends beyond the middle of the 

 meros. 



The outer antennae are about half as long as the internal, and the penulti- 

 mate joint is the longest. 



The median lamina of the caudal fin is rounded at the end, and its margin is 

 not ciliated. The lateral lamina increase progressively but little in length, 

 and each one bears a ridge which is continued almost to the margin. 



The feet of the second pair are provided with long hairs on their internal 

 borders. The feet of the fourth pair are nearly as much compressed as the an- 

 terior, and the basilar article is much enlarged. 



This species agrees very closely with the description of the Callianidea typa 

 of Milne Edwards, (Hist. Nat. des Crustaces, vol. ii. p. 320) but on a compari- 

 son with the figures it appears to differ in the form of some of the joints of the

maxilliped, and in the presence of a tooth on the inner margin of the mero?, as 

 well as by the entire and plain margin of the median caudal lamina. Other 

 differences seem to exist, which a comparison of the species would probably 

 substantiate. The two species are also inhabitants of very distinct zoological 

 regions, the Callianidea typa being a native of the shores of New Ireland, 

 while the C. laevicauda was obtained under rocks, within coral reefs, at the 

 Island of Barbados, in the West Indies. The size of the two species is nearly 

 similar. 



Description of a new genus of SALARIAN.BE, from the West Indies. 



BY THEO. GILL. 



Entomacrodus Gill. 



Body naked, elongated and slender, slowly declining to the caudal. Head 

 obliquely compressed, oblong subquadrate, and with the profile vertical. Oper- 

 cula unarmed. Eyes lateral, closely approximated, situated at the angle of the 

 profile with the postocular region. No superciliary or nasal tentacles or append- 

 ages. Branchial apertures continuous under the throat. Branchial membrane 

 free and dilatable. Branchiostegal rays six. Mouth moderate, with the con- 

 tour of the upper jaw semicircular ; upper jaw protruding beyond the lower. 

 Lips moderate, uniform and free, concealing the teeth. Teeth labial and move- 

 able, very slender and recurved, contiguous and uniserial. Lower jaw with an 

 interior very large and recurved tooth on each side, which is received into a 

 corresponding fossette of the palate. Dorsal fins disconnected, nearly equal to 

 each other in length ; the posterior free from the caudal. Anal equalling or 

 exceeding the second dorsal. Caudal with its posterior mai'gin obtusely 

 rounded. Pectorals moderate, angularly rounded. Ventrals approximated, 

 each with three simple rays, the internal of which is smallest. 



On a comparison with a true species of Salarias, this genus is found to differ 

 in its more elongated form, by the separate dorsals, and by the absence of any 

 superciliary appendages. The canine teeth of the lower jaw are greatly devel- 

 oped, but they are found of nearly equal size in several species that have been 

 referred to the genus Salaricts. One of the species so distinguished is an inhab- 

 itant of the West Indian seas, and has been described under the name of Sala- 

 ricts atlanticus, by Ouvier and Valenciennes, in the Histoire Naturelle des Pois- 

 sons. That species has an oblong body, superciliary appendages, and the dor- 

 sals connected at the base, and is therefore a true Salarias. 



E. Nigricans Gill. The elongated body, from the snout to the end of the 

 caudal fin, is between seven and eight times longer than it is high at the pec- 

 torals ; its height at the caudal is about a thirteenth of the same length. 



The head is subquadrate, and forms two-ninths of the total length. Its 

 greatest height equals two-thirds of its length. It sides decline obliquely out- 

 wards and downwards. 



The first dorsal commences near the nape, and two of its rays are in advance 

 of the pectorals. The second dorsal commences immediately behind the first, 

 and nearly over the fourth ray of the anal; it ceases some distance from the 

 base of the caudal. The anal is more uniform in height than the dorsal, and 

 ceases before it does. The caudal forms less than a fifth of the total length.

The general color of the body and fins is blackish. 



A single specimen was caught in shallow water, at the island of Barbados,

HERPETOLOGIC AL NOTICES. 

 BY CHARLES GIRARD, M. D. 



I. Bufo lamentor. Upper surface of head nearly plane; skin thick, not ad- 

 hering to the skull. Snout prominent. Parotids small, elongated. Tympa- 

 num small and subcircular. Tongue lanceolated, very free posteriorly where 

 broadest. Upper jaw slightly emarginated. Limbs well developed, of stout 

 appearance. First finger nearly as long as the third. Palm of hands tubercu- 

 lar. Two carpal disks. A membranous fold along the inner edge of the tarsus. 

 Toes webbed to near their tips. Two moderately developed metatarsal tuber- 

 cles. Sole of feet tubercular. Skin above glandulous ; beneath warty. Color 

 greenish brown, maculated with black above and beneath. 



The head is broad and depressed ; its length entering three times in that of 

 the body, hence constituting the fourth of the entire length. Its upper surface 

 is even, that is to say it exhibits neither crests nor grooves ; the skin not 

 adhering to the skull. The snout is rather prominent. The interocular space 

 is wider than the eyelid. The nostrils are equidistant between the anterior 

 rim of the orbit and the notch of the upper jaw. The tympanum is small and 

 subcircular; its horizontal diameter being half that of the eye. The parotid 

 glands are small, elongated, subovate ; they are perforated by very small and 

 distant pores, whilst their surface is either smooth or minutely granular. 



The snout is large and the upper jaw but slightly emarginated; the tongue 

 being elongated, subelliptical, and free upon the half or even two-thirds of its 

 length. The inner nostrils are quite large and transversely elongated. The 

 openings of the eustachian tubes are nearly equal in size to the inner nostrils. 



The limbs are stout and very much developed ; the anterior ones, when 

 stretched backwards, extend beyond the groins, and the posterior ones when 

 extended forwards project the extremity of three toes beyond the snout. Both 

 fingers and toes, are depressed, whilst the tubercles under the articulations of 

 the phalanges are rather conspicuous ; the palm of the hands and the sole of the 

 feet being coarsely granular. There are two carpal disks ; the middle one is 

 very large, whilst that at the base of the inner finger is but slightly larger than 

 the subarticular knobs, in the young, proportionally much larger in the adult. 

 The metatarsal tubercles are subconical ; the innermost being somewhat larger 

 than the others. The toes are palmated to near their tips, but the interdigital 

 membrane is deeply and broadly emarginated. 



Large glandular warts are spread irregularly over the head, body and limbs, 

 more conspicuously over the back, and especially over the thighs. The 

 intervening space exhibits miliary granules hardly perceptible to the unarmed 

 eye. The inferior surface is wrinkled in various ways, spread over with granu- 

 lar warts and minute granules. 



The ground color is greenish brown, somewhat lighter or whitish beneath, 

 maculated with black all over the head, body and limbs, above as well as be- 

 low. On the upper surface, the black patches generally surround the glandu- 

 lar warts, whilst on the sides they assume a meandering aspect. An exiguous 

 dorsal light streak or filet is generally observed from the snout to the coccyx, 

 although sometimes obliterated in whole or in part. 



Specimens of this species were collected about Fort Bridger, Utah Territory, 

 by Mr. Drexler, according to whom they are very common. 



II. Engystoma texense. Head constituting the third of the total length. 

 Snout forming an acute triangle rounded at the summit. Gape of the mouth 

 horizontal, its cleft extending to a perpendicular line drawn posteriorly to the 

 pupil. Limbs slender; three carpal callosities, and one metatarsal tubercle. 

 Palm of hands and sole of feet smooth. Skin smooth also. Color above light 

 olivaceous brown, with a few black dots posteriorly; beneath uniform whitish.

This species is allied to E. carolinense, and differs from it by a more depressed 

 and flattened head, a more truncated snout which, as usual, protrudes beyond 

 the lower jaw. The body itself is likewise more depressed, and the limbs 

 assume a slender appearance. 



The head is continuous with the body, and constitutes about the third of their 

 combined length. The cleft of the mouth does not extend as far back as in 

 E. carolinense, since it corresponds to a perpendicular line drawn behind the 

 pupil. The longitudinal diameter of the eye is equal to the distance between 

 the orbit and the nostril. The interocular space, measured across the anterior 

 rim of the orbits, is greater than the rostral space from the orbits forwards. 

 The symphysis of the lower jaw presents the same structure as in the species 

 just alluded to. 



The skin is perfectly smooth throughout in all the specimens which we have 

 examined; they were collected in April, and are, no doubt, liable to assume a 

 rougher appearance during the hotter and more dry season of the year. 



The ground color of the upper region of the head, body and limbs, is of a 

 light olivaceous brown tint, anteriorly uniform, posteriorly besprinkled with 

 small black spots or dots especially over the coccyx and thighs. A whitish 

 tint pervades uniformly throughout the inferior regions. 



Specimens of this species were procured in Texas, by Capt. John Pope.

Numerous specimens of this little known and handsome bird are from the 

 Camma and Ogobai. This is a very changeable species in its specific charac- 

 ters, especially in the markings of the under parts and the shade of color of the 

 upper, and I am not quite sure that there are not two species in the present 

 collection. The most obvious variation is in the size of the white circular and 

 cordate spots on the under part of the body ; usually these are small and ter- 

 minal, but specimens occur, of both sexes, in which they are large, and enclose 

 a spot of black. 



Prof. Schlegel's beautiful plate of this bird, cited above, represents it as 

 lighter colored on the upper parts than is usual in the collections of Mr. Du- 

 chaillu. 



201. Synoicus Adansonii, (Verreaux). 



Ooturnix Adansonii, Ver. Rev. et Mag. Zool. 1851, p. 515. 

 One specimen only of this little species from the Ogobai, which is a female, 

 but readily identified from M. Verreaux's types in the Acad. Mus. This hand-

 Gould, and resembles several of them in general appearance.

" Anas cyanoptera, Temm. Mus. Lugd." 



The name by which this handsome species is given in Dr. Hartlaub's Orni- 

 thology of Western Africa, adopted from that of Temminck in the Leyden 

 Museum, was long since anticipated by Vieillot in Nouv. Diet. v. p. 104. The 

 species too, described by Vieillot as Anas cyanoptera, is a Querquedula, and the 

 same as described and figured by me in Birds of Caiifornia and Texas i. p. 82, 

 pi. 15, and now well known as a bird of the Western regions of North America. 

 I take the liberty, therefore, of applying to this bird the name of its first dis- 

 criber, in which I hope to be sustained by naturalists, not only for reason? 

 above mentioned, but as an act of justice to one who has contributed in the 

 most important manner to Western African Ornithology. 



This handsome bird is evidently an abundant species on the Camma and 

 Ogobai. The sexes are very nearly alike.

 Mr. Lea, President, in the Chair. 

 Present thirty-seven members. 



Mr. Lea presented the following, which was referred to a committee : 

 Description of four new species of Exotic Unionidae. 



Mr. Lea read letters which he had received from Dr. Lewis of Mohawk, New 

 York, in which he mentions the astonishing number of dead shells of Anodonta 

 Lewisii, Lea, in the canal, also the immense number of dead specimens of Cycles, 

 as they lie in beds from three to eight inches deep. He says he had taken two 

 gallons of living specimens from an area of six by four feet. They do not bur- 

 row deeply in the mud, while the Unio goes down tivo feet. Mr. Lea compared 

 this mass with the great deposit of fresh water gasteropods at Milk Pond, N. J. 

 Dr. Lewis also collected specimens on the East Branch of the Unadilla, a small 

 stream fourteen miles south west of Mohawk, and got about 200 Anodonta Unadilla 

 DeKay= An. edentula, Say. Subsequently he visited Cedar Lake, a small body of 

 water in Herkimer County, the south shores of which were composed of a 

 greenish white marl, consisting of the remains of untold millions of shells. In 

 the middle branch of the Unadilla, Dr. Lewis says, " I stopped ju9t long enough 

 to find one living specimen to be sure it was there. Dead shells were not 

 rare, but I did not spend much time, only to learn the character of the stream, 

 so as to be able to verify your opinion that Anodonta Unadilla was only a local 

 variety of An. edentula, Say." 



Mr. Lea also mentioned that he had received specimens in alcohol of Unio 

 Kleinianus, Lea, from G. Hallenbeck Esq., of Columbus, Georgia, to which that 

 ardent naturalist called his attention, as possessing a branchial uterus in both 

 lobes of the bronchia on each side. This very remarkable feature in the functions 

 of the female of this species, constitutes the third which has been observed by 

 Mr. Lea, two he had formerly shown to the Academy, namely, that of Unio 

 multiplication, Lea, and rubiginosus, Lea. 



July 12th. 

 Vice-President Le Conte, in the Chair. 

 Present nineteen members. 



Prof. Holmes exhibited a collection of fossils from the post-pliocene 

 of South Carolina. He remarked : 



If we examine the collection of remains of vertebrated animals taken from 

 the post-pliocene or post-tertiary beds of South Carolina which I have the 

 pleasure of exhibiting this evening to the members of the Academy, we will be 

 surprised at the resemblance in many of the forms to corresponding parts of 

 some of our domestic animals, as the horse, dog, hog, bull, etc., and the ques- 

 tion may very naturally suggest itself are the living horses, dogs, hogs, rac- 

 coons, opossums, deer, elk, tapirs, beavers, etc., and the one hundred and fifty 

 species of mollusca now living on the coast, the descendants of the animals 

 whose remains we find fossil in these beds, or are these truly fossil remains, 

 and not accidental occupants of this deposit? 



My object is not to enter upon a discussion of these questions, but simply to 

 exhibit the collection, and state the facts connected with their discovery, and 

 the geological evidence of their being true fossils found in an extensive forma- 

 tion in the low country of South Carolina, included in a belt about ten miles 

 wide, and occupying depressions in the great marl bed of the Eocene period. 



Three distinct formations or beds are here supposed to belong to this post* 

 pliocene age. First the marine beds, composed of a gray sandy clay in which 

 are imbedded innumerable small shells, sometimes very comminuted, but of 

 species now common and living on the coast ; many of the large shells are 



1859.] 14 




178 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



preserved in the position they occupied when living, having both valves entire 

 and perfect, and presenting tbe appearance of having been destroyed suddenly 

 by an avalanche of sand. 



The second, is the blue or pluff-mud bed, composed of a stiff blue clay, con- 

 taining silicious pebbles, and masses of conglomerates, water-worn and boulder- 

 like, but no angular blocks, and also remains of marine and terrestrial animals. 

 These pebbles and rolled conglomerates contain casts of the fossils common to 

 the marl of the Eocene bed upon which the blue mud rests, and it has been 

 ascertained that the silicious conglomerates are fragments of the marl, broken 

 off, we infer, by the action of waves, and rolled upon the beach of a post-plio- 

 cene sea ; they afterwards were imbedded in the blue mud, lost all their lime 

 or calcareous particles, and became silicified. 



The third or upper bed includes the peaty deposits, yellow sand and clays, 

 which overlie the pluff-mud. 



Sections of the three most important localities may be represented in the 

 following diagrams : 



Marine bed of the Wadmalarr. 



Yellow Sand 15 feet. 



Ferruginous sand with casts of shells 2 feet. 



Red clay 2 feet. 



Gray sand and mud with comminuted shells, fossils in fine preservation. .3^ feet. 



Ashley River beds. 

 Yellow sands with bands of Ferruginous clay 4 feet. 



Blue mud resting on the white Eocene marl 1 foot. 



Goose Creek beds. 

 Yellow sand 12 feet. 



Blue mud 2 feet. 



Ferruginous sand containing bones, etc .3 inches- 



Yellow sand 3 feet. 



Pliocene marl resting on the Eocene white marl 12 feet. 



The fossil bones obtained from these strata are often in a fine state of pre- 

 servation, especially those taken from the blue mud, which are generally petri- 

 fied ; those from the sands are likewise well preserved, but in the peaty or 

 upper beds they are not so petrified, retain all their gelatine and appear to de- 

 compose rapidly. Most of the specimens in the collection now before you 

 were some time ago submitted by me to jour distinguished anatomist Professor 

 Leidy, for determination. When they were returned I found a number labelled 

 recent, which labels you will find still retained and attached to their respective 

 specimens ; at the same time the Professor wrote to say, "that they appeared to 

 belong to recent sp'^ies which had become accidental occupants of the same 

 bed with the true fossils." I held tbe opposite opinion, and believed that they 

 were true fossil remains, as I had myself collected them, not only from the 

 banks and deltas of rivers, but a large number from excavations several feet 

 below the surface, at a distanc. rrom any ereek, pond or river, and in some 

 cases from excavations below the high sandy land of cotton fields. 



But a few weeks ago Dr. Klipstein, who resides near Charleston, in digging a 

 ditch for the purpose of reclaiming a large swamp, discovered and sent me the 

 tooth of a mastodon, one of the black specimens in the tray before you, with 

 the request that I should go down and visit the place, as there were indications

of the bones and teeth of the animal still remaining in the sands which under- 

 lie the peat-bed. Accordingly, with a small party of gentlemen, we visited the 

 Doctor, and succeeded not only in obtaining several other teeth and bones ot 

 this animal, but nearly one entire tusk, and immediately along side of the tusk 

 discovered the fragment of pottery which I hold in my hand, and which is simi- 

 lar to that manufactured at the present time by the American Indians. The 

 depth of the excavation was about three feet below the surface ; bones of the 

 deer and two teeth of a horse were also found. 



This is not a drift-bed, but a deposite of the peat and sands of the post-plio- 

 cene formation. The marine beds with their characteristic shells lie immedi- 

 ately beneath, and is exposed on the high land which surrounds the swamp. 

 If we take the one hundred and fifty species of mollusca, whose shells are so 

 beautifully preserved in these beds, and place the entire groupalong side of a 

 similar collection of the shells of the recent species living upon the coast, we 

 will observe that they are identically the same in form, character and every 

 other respect, except the following. There are among the fossils two shells whose 

 analogues are not now living upon the sea coast of Carolina, but are common 

 in the gulf of Mexico, and West Indian seas. Slrombus pugilis, abundant on 

 the coast of Florida and Cuba, is a fossil of the post-pliocene ; and Gnathodon 

 cuneatum, now living in the estuaries near Mobile, and along the northern 

 coast of the Gulf is found fossil at a depth of eighteen or twenty feet under 

 the city of Charleston, and in such numbers that cart-loads may be obtained 

 from a single locality. 



Again, we find two more species that are now extinct, or rather unknown to 

 me in a recent state, one of which I have lately figured and described as Caro- 

 lina Tuomeyii, after my late friend and colleague Prof. Tuomey; the other is Tel- 

 ledora lunulata, Adams, a shell described as recent, from Carolina, but in fact 

 a fossil in the post-pliocene and extinct. 



Now let us compare this group of remains of the vertebrata with a similar 

 group of living animals. Among the former we find teeth of the deer, raccoon, 

 opossum and others well known to be living at the present time in South Caro- 

 lina ; but like the invertebrata we find two or three species which are no longer 

 existing north of Mexico and South America the peccary, the capybara and the 

 tapir. Again, there are remains of the musk-rat and beaver, but these two 

 animals are extinct in the low country of South Carolina; the beaver has in- 

 deed almost been extirpated to the east of the Mississippi river, and the musk- 

 rat is confined to a region above the falls of the rivers of this State. 



The mastodon, the megatherium, the mylodon and perhaps one or two others, 

 are extinct. 



That we may the better appreciate the interesting analogy existing between 

 these two groups as regards the living and extinct species, we will place them 

 in a tubular form, thus :

The evidence which I propose to adduce for the correctness of my assertion 

 that these are true fossils, will the better appear by the following extracts from 

 a pamphlet issued a short time since, and which, in consequence of the great 

 demand, has passed through two editions, and is now again out of print. 



In a letter to Dr. Nott and Mr. Gliddon,* dated Feb. 10, 1857, Prof. Leidy 

 writes : 



"Sometime since, Professor F. S. Holmes, of Charleston, submitted for my 

 examination, a collection of fossil bones from a post-pliocene deposit on 

 Ashley River, S. Carolina. Among remains of the extinct horse, the peccary, 

 mylodon, megatherium, mastodon, hipparion, the tapir, the capybara, the 

 beaver, the musk-rat, etc., were some which I considered as belonging to the 

 dog, the domestic ox, the sheep and the hog. Prof. Holmes observes that these 

 remains were taken from an extensive deposit, in which similar ones exist 

 abundantly, and he further adds, that he cannot conceive that the latter should 

 have become mingled with the former, since the introduction of domestic ani- 

 mals into America by Europeans. It is not improbable that the American con- 

 tinent once had, as part of its fauna, representatives of our domestic animals, 

 which subsequently became extinct though I am inclined to doubt it; but 

 what we have learned of the extinct American horse, will lead me carefully to 

 investigate the subject." 



The opportunity for prosecuting this investigation, to some extent, I had the 

 pleasure of affording Professor Leidy, in March last, a month after the date of 

 the above letter. Dr. Hallowell and himself visited me in Charleston, and I 

 accompanied them to Ashley ferry and Goose creek. The annexed extracts are 

 from a paper of Professor Leidy's on this topic, written after his return home 

 to Philadelphia, and he has also kindly sent me a number of very valuable 

 drawings of fossil horse teeth, and other remains obtained from the Carolina 

 beds f 



" The interesting collection of remains of vetebrated animals, which form 

 the subject of the following pages, for the most part have been submitted to 

 the inspection of the author, by Prof. Holmes and Capt. A. H. Bowman, U. S. A., 

 who collected them from the eocene, post-pliocene, and recent geological for- 

 mations, in the vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina. 



"The collections of these gentlemen consist of a most remarkable intermix- 

 ture of remains of fishes, reptiles and mammals, of the three periods mentioned ; 

 and in many cases perhaps we may err in referring a particular species to a 

 certain formation, more especially in the case of the fishes. The remains 

 usually consist of teeth often well preserved, but frequently in small fragments, 

 more or less water-worn, and most of the fossils are stained brown or black. 



" By far the greater portion of the fossil remains are obtained from the post- 

 pliocene deposit of the Ashley River, about ten miles from Charleston. The 

 country in this locality is composed of a base of whitish eocene marl, contain- 

 ing remains of squalodon sharks and rays above which is a stratum of post- 

 pliocene mud, abont one foot in thickness, overlaid by about three feet of sand 

 and earth mould. 



" The post-pliocene mud contains great quantities of irregular, water-worn 

 fragments of the eocene marl rock from beneath, mingled with sand, blackened 

 pebbles, water rolled fragments of bones, and more perfect remains of fishes, 

 reptiles and mammals, belonging to the post-pliocene and eocene fossils. 



"On the shores of the Ashley River, where the post-pliocene and eocene 

 formations are exposed, the fossils are washed from their beds, and become 

 mingled with the remains of recent indigenous and domestic animals, and ob- 

 jects of human art, so that when a collection is made in this locality, it is some- 

 times difficult to determine whether the animal remains belong to the forma-

tions mentioned or not. Generally, however, we have been able to ascertain 

 where the fossils belong, which we have had the opportunity of examining, 

 from the fact that the greater number were obtained from the deposits re- 

 ferred to in digging into them some distance from the Ashley River. 



" The collections coatain remains of the horse, ox, sheep, hog and dog, which 

 I feel strongly persuaded, with the exception of many of those of the first men- 

 tioned animal, are of recent date, and have become mingled with the true fos- 

 sils of the post-pliocene and eocene formations, where these have been exposed 

 on the banks of the Ashley River and its tributaries. In regard to the remains 

 of the horse, from the facts stated in the account given of them in the succeed- 

 ing pages, I think it will be conceded that this animal inhabited the United 

 States during the post-pliocene period, contemporarily with the mastodon, me- 

 galonyx, and the great broad fronted bison. 



" Many of the mammalian remains are of recent animals, or at least are un- 

 distinguishable from the corresponding parts of the latter ; and if they are 

 not accidental occupants of the post-pliocene deposit, are highly interesting, 

 as indicating their contemporaneous existence with many species and genera 

 now extinct.* 



"It appears to be quite well authenticated that the horse, which is now so 

 extensively distributed, both in a wild and domestic condition, throughout 

 North and South America, did not inhabit these continents at the time of their 

 discovery by Europeans. With this fact in view, in conjunction with the cir- 

 cumstance that animal remains of late periods may become accidental occu- 

 pants of earlier geological formations, we should require strong evidence to be 

 advanced before it is admitted that the Horse belonged to an ancient fauna of 

 the western world. At the present time the evidence appears to be sufficiently 

 ample to justify the latter conclusion, and it is further sustained by the dis- 

 covery, in the same part of the world, of the remains of two species of the 

 closely allied genus Hipparion. 



"Remains of the horse, discovered in Brazil, Buenos-Ayres, Chile, have been 

 indicated by Dr. Lund, Prof. Owen, M. Weddell, and M. Gervais. These re- 

 mains exhibit no well marked characters distinguishing them from correspond- 

 ing portions of the skeleton of the recent horse, and from a comparison of the 

 figures and descriptions which have been given of most of them, together with 

 some remarks of the latter author, it is doubtful whether they belong to more 

 than a single species, the Equus neogceus of Dr. Lund. 



" Prof. Buckland and Sir John Richardson have described remains of the 

 horse, discovered in association with those of the elephant, moose, reindeer, 

 and musk-ox, in the ice cliffs of Eschscholtz Bay, Arctic America. 



" In the United States, remains of the Horse, chiefly consisting of teeth, have 

 been noticed by Drs. Mitchell,f Harlan,J and DeKay, but these gentlemen have 

 neither given descriptions nor figures by which to identify the specimens. 

 Some .of the latter are stated to have been found in the vicinity of Neversink 

 Hills, New Jersey ; others in the excavation for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, 

 near Georgetown, District of Columbia ; and some in the latter tertiary deposit 

 on the Neuse River, in the vicinity of Newbern, North Carolina. Dr. DeKay, 

 in speaking of such remains, says, " they resemble those of the common horse, 

 but from their size apparently belonged to a larger animal," and he refers 

 them to a species with the name of Equus major.

horse in the pliocene deposit of Darlington, South-Carolina ; in Richland Dis- 

 trict of the same State; in Skidaway Island, Georgia, and on the banks of the 

 Potomac river. He further observes that he obtained the tooth of a horse, 

 from eocene marl, in the Ashley river, South Carolina, but the researches of 

 Prof. Holmes* indubitably indicate the specimen to have been an accidental 

 occupant of the formation. 



" Specimens of isolated teeth, and a few bones of the horse, from the post- 

 pliocene and recent deposits of this country, have frequently been submitted 

 to my inspection. Many of these I have unhesitatingly pronounced to be relics 

 of the domestic horse, though I feel persuaded that many remains of an extinct 

 species are undistinguishable from the recent one. 



" Whether more than one extinct species is indicated among the numerous 

 specimens of teeth I have had the opportunity of examining, I have been un- 

 able satisfactorily to determine. The specimens present so much difference in 

 condition of preservation, or change in structure ; so much variation in size, 

 from that of the more ordinary horse to the largest English dray horse; and 

 such variableness in constitution, from that of the recent horse to the most 

 complex condition belonging to any extinct species described, that it would be 

 about as easy to indicate a half dozen species as it would two. 



Under the circumstances,! would characterize the extinct horse of the United 

 States as having had about the same size as the recent one, ranging from the 

 more ordinary varieties to the English dray horse, with molar teeth, frequently 

 comparatively simple in construction, but with a strong disposition to become 

 complex. 



" Among the number of teeth of the horse in Prof. Holmes' collection labelled 

 as coming from the post-pliocene deposit of Ashley River, there are several, 

 which, from their size, construction and condition of preservation, I feel con- 

 vinced are of recent date : and these no doubt became mingled with the true 

 fossils of that formation where it is exposed on the Ashley River, in which 

 position I personally found undoubted remains of the recent horse and other 

 domestic animals, and objects of human art, mingled with remains of fishes, 

 reptiles, and mammals, washed by the river from the banks, composed of eocene 

 and post-pliocene deposits. 



" Teeth of an extinct species of horse, however, undoubtedly belong as true 

 fossils to the post-pliocene formations in the vicinity of Charleston. These 

 are usually hard in texture, stained brown or black from the infiltration of ox- 

 ide of iron, sometimes well preserved, but more frequently in a fragmentary 

 condition and water-worn. Generally they are not larger than the teeth of the 

 more ordinary varieties of the domestic horse, and sometimes are quite as simple 

 in the plication of their enamel, but usually are more complex and sometimes 

 exceedingly so. 



" Figure 1 represents a first superior molar tooth, neither larger nor more 

 complex in structure than the corresponding tooth of the recent Horse. This 

 specimen, which is dense and jet black in color, was obtained by Prof. Holmes 

 from a stratum of ferruginous sand, two inches thick, exposed on the side of a 

 bluff, on Goose Creek, about twelve miles from Charleston. 



" Having expressed a desire to see the locality from which the tooth just 

 mentioned was obtained, Prof. Holmes afforded me the opportunity of doing so. 

 The bluff is about thirty feet high ; its base is formed of a pliocene limestone, 

 about fifteen feet thick, and composed of the debris of marine shells : above 

 this is the stratum of ferruginous sand, of post-pliocene age, containing nu- 

 merous pebbles and rolled fragments of bone all blackened like the tooth ob- 

 tained from the same positios. Overlying the latter stratum, there is a layer 

 of stiff blue clay, about two feet in thickness, and above this there are about 

 twelve feet of sand and earth-mould. 



* Ibidem, 68. 



[July, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 183 



" A similar blackened tooth was obtained from the same formation at Doctor's 

 Swamp, John's Island. 



" Figure 4 represents a very remarkably well preserved specimen of a lower 

 molar above referred to from Georgia, where it was discovered by J. H. Couper, 

 in association with equally well preserved remains of other extinct animals. 

 The tooth is brown in color ; and it neither differs in size nor form from its 

 homologue in the recent horse. 



"In the collection of fossils of Prof. Holmes, there is the specimen of an 

 upper first large molar, labelled from Texas, represented in figure 5. The tooth 

 is of the largest comparative size, and exhibits the highest degree of com- 

 plexity in the folding of its enamel ; iu both of which characters it differs in 

 such a remarkable degree from the corresponding tooth, represented in figure 

 5, from the post-pliocene formation of South Carolina, that it appears hardly 

 possible that these two teeth should belong to the same species of horse. 



" A remarkably well preserved specimen of an upper molar tooth, jet black 

 in color, and an incisor, yellow and quite friable in texture, both belonging to 

 the extinct horse, from North Carolina, have been submitted to my inspection 

 by Prof. Emmons. 



" Among the most interesting of the fossils discovered by Prof. Holmes, in 

 the post-pliocene beds of the Ashley River, are two molar teeth of a species of 

 the equine genus Hippotherium. These are the first remains of the latter dis- 

 covered in America, and they indicate the smallest known species. 



" Both specimens are from the upper jaw ; and they are well characterized, 

 not only by the isolation of the internal median enamel column, but also by 

 the complex plication of the interior or central enamel columns. 



" The larger specimen is firm in texture ; has the enamel stained jet black, 

 and the dentine and cement gray. 



" I have personally had the opportunity of inspecting remains of the tapir, 

 found in Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and Souh Caro- 

 lina, proving an extensive range of this animal at one time over the country of 

 the United States. 



"The specimens which were presented by Dr. Carpenter to the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, on close comparison are not found to differ 

 from the corresponding parts of the living Tapir us americanus. 



"The post-pliocene deposit of the Ashlej' River contains a number of small 

 fragments of molar teeth, and one nearly entire and unworn crown of a second 

 lower molar, which have the same characters of form and size, as in the living 

 tapir. Besides these, the same collections contain fragments of lower molars, 

 and two nearly entire crowns of upper molars, having the exact form of the 

 corresponding teeth of the T. americanus, but larger in size. 



" Teeth of the beaver, jet black in color, have likewise been obtained from 

 the post-pliocene deposit of Ashley River. 



"The collections contain numerous specimens of blackened molar teeth, to- 

 gether with a few incisors and fragments of jaws, from the Ashley post-plio- 

 cene deposit, which neither differ iu form nor size from the corresponding parts 

 of the recent muskrat. 



" Remains of Lepus sylvaticus common gray rabbit have been found in 

 association with those of other rodents and of the extinct peccary near Galena, 

 Illinois. A few specimens of molar teeth, black in color, apparently belonging 

 to this species, were obtained from the post-pliocene beds of the Ashley 

 River. 



" Several small fragments of teeth of the Megatherium, in Prof. Holmes' col- 

 lection, were obtained from the post-pliocene bed of the Ashley River. Pre- 

 viously to the discovery of those specimens, remains of the Megatherium bad 

 been found in no other locality of North America than in the State of Georgia. 



" Two small fragments of lower molar teeth of Mylodon Jlarlani were ob- 

 tained from the Ashley post-pliocene beds. One of the fragments is repre-

sented in figure 21, plate xvi. of 'A memoir on the extinct Sloth Tribe of 

 North America,' by the author." 



As regards the specimens of human art found as above, it must be remarked 

 that it is only at this locality Ashley Ferry that we find such relics. Here 

 at the base of a low bluff, is a beach of eocene marl ; above the bluff is a farm- 

 yard, and all the sweepings of the premises, consisting in part of old hoes, 

 broken plough-shares, and fragments of crockery-ware, etc., are thrown into 

 the river, and lie mingled with the fossils which are washed out of the bluff, 

 and scattered over the surface of the beach below, which is exposed at low 

 tide. At no other locality on this river, and there are several, viz. : Ramsay's, 

 Clement's, Greer's, Middleton's, etc., where similar fossils are found, do we 

 obtain relics of human art ; at least, I have never found such. 



The fossils from Ashley Ferry present, as a group, the same appearance as 

 those procured inland at some distance from the river, by digging from three 

 to five feet below the surface. Many specimens from the ferry were considered 

 as recent by Professor Leidy ; they appear quite fresh and unchanged in color, 

 and their texture not in the slightest degree altered. To one familiar with the 

 fossils of the South Carolina Post-Pliocene, this excites no surprise, as it is of 

 common occurrence, more especially among the shells; for example, the olive 

 shell Oliva literata is found as fresh and highly polished as the recent ones 

 from the sea-beaches along the coast ; and Cardium magnum retains often the 

 delicate yellow and brown markings, common to the species. 



Tlie color or texture of a fossil, therefore, does not always absolutely deter- 

 mine its relative age ; as Professor Leidy has himself remarked in a foot-note 

 to his letter alluded to above, viz. : 



" Fossilization, petrifaction, or lapidification, is no positive indication of the 

 relative age of organic remains. 



"The Cabinet of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia contains 

 bones of the megalonyx, and of the extinct peccary, that are entirely unchanged ; 

 not a particle of gelatin has been lost, nor a particle of mineral matter added, 

 and, indeed, some of the bones of the former even have portions of articular 

 cartilage and tendinous attachments, well preserved."* 



From the foregoing it would appear that of the ancient fauna of America, 

 which included representatives of many of our present domestic animals, some 

 species have undoubtedly become extinct; but-I confess I am not yet prepared 

 to admit from any evidence yet adduced, or from my own examinations, that 

 all of the living species are distinct from those found fossil in the post-plio- 

 cene. The teeth and bones of the rabbit, raccoon, opossum, deer, elk, hog, dog, 

 sheep, ox and horse, are often found in these beds, and though associated with 

 those known to be extinct, such as mastodon, megatherium, hipparion, etc., 

 need not necessarily be referred to extinct races also ; since their remains can- 

 not be distinguished from the bones and teeth of the living species. 



It has been just remarked that about ninety-five per cent., or nearly all of the 

 one hundred and fifty shells of molluscous animals from these beds are specifi- 

 cally identical with the recent or living species of the coast, two are found 

 only at the south of this, and two are extinct. Of the vertebrates from the 

 same bed, the tapir, peccary, raccoon, opossum, deer, musk-rat, rabbit, beaver, 

 and elk have still their living representatives, generically, if not specifically ; and 

 even of the identity of species there seems to be no doubt, as no anatomical 

 differences can be discerned. Two of these species, like the mollusca just al- 

 luded to, no longer live in South Carolina; the tapir and peccary are only 

 found in South America and Mexico; the musk-rat, elk and beaver, though ex- 

 tinct on the Atlantic coast, are still living in the interior of the country. And 

 though it has been acknowledged that the mastodon, megatherium, elephant, 

 glvptodon, and two species of Equine genera, etc., are entirely extinct, yet the

[July, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 185 



discoveries made of the remains even of some of these, would indicate that 

 they still existed at a period so recent, that, in the language of Professor Leidy, 

 " it is probable the red man witnessed their declining existence." 



The peccary, or Mexican hog, an animal common in Mexico, is not indigenous 

 to the Atlantic United States; but his bones have been found associated with 

 human remains in caves used as cemeteries by the Aborigines.* " A tomb in 

 the city of Mexico," according to Clavigero, (?)f " was found to contain the 

 bones of an entire mammoth, the sepulchre appearing to have been formed ex- 

 pressly for their reception." And "Mr. Latrobe relates that during the prose- 

 cution of some excavations, near the city of Tezcuco, one of the ancient roads 

 or causeways was discovered, and on one side, only three feet below the sur- 

 face, in what may have been the ditch of the road, there lay the entire skeleton 

 of a mastodon. It bore every appearance of having been coeval with the period 

 when the road was used." 



Again I extract from Prof. Leidy's letter : J 



" The early existence of the genera to which our domestic animals belong, ha3 

 been adduced as presumptive evidence of the advent of man at a more remote 

 period than is usually assigned. It must be remembered, however, even at the 

 present time, that of some of these genera only a few species are domesticated : 

 thus of the existing six species of Equus (Horse) only two have ever been freely 

 brought under the dominion of man. 



" The horse did not exist in America at the time of its discovery by Europeans ; 

 but its remains, consisting chiefly of molar teeth, have now been so frequently 

 found in association with those of extinct animals, that it is generally admitted 

 once to have been an aboriginal inhabitant. When I first saw examples of 

 these remains I was not disposed to view them as relics of an extinct species ; 

 for although some presented characteristic differences from those of previously 

 known species, others were undistinguishable from the corresponding parts of the 

 domestic horse, and among them were intermediate varieties of form and size. 

 The subsequent discovery of the remains of two species of the closely allied 

 extinct genus Hipparion, in addition to the discovery of remains of two extinct 

 equine genera of an earlier geological period, leaves no room to doubt the 

 former existence of the horse on the American continent, contemporaneously 

 with the Mastodon and Megalonyx : and man probably was his companion." 



The iesult of the whole seems to be, that of the animals found fossil in the 

 post-pliocene beds, all the mollusca of the present day are undoubtedly a per- 

 petuation of the same species ; that of the higher order of vertebrata, the tapir, 

 peccary, raccoon, opossum, deer, elk, and musk-rat are equally entitled to be 

 considered the descendants of this ancient race. And if the claims of the 

 mollusca to this distinction rest upon a secure basis, because they are peculiar 

 to this country, and not obnoxious to suspicion of foreign immigration, it must 

 be recollected that this is equally true of the above named animals. 



Those which have hitherto been regarded as of recent and European origin, 

 are the horse, sheep, hog, and ox ; and it must be reserved perhaps for future 

 consideration to determine how far the negative proof of the non-existence of 

 these animals in the country at the time of its discovery may be regarded in each 

 individual case sufficiently strong to settle the question of his extinction and 

 reintroduction, when so many of his associates and contemporaries have suc- 

 ceeded in maintaining an unbroken line of descent down to the present day.

pliocene beds of South Carolina. Indeed I have been thinking of them 

 continually since I saw them, and nothing impressed me so deeply for many 

 years past as the sight of these bones. I consider their careful study in all 

 their relations as of the utmost importance for the progress of our science. It 

 is true there is hardly anything of interest in the animals themselves, since 

 they appear to be all well known types, but their simultaneous occurrence in 

 the same beds, showing that they have lived together at a time when the white 

 man had not yet planted himself upon this continent, render their association as 

 undisputed. How does it happen, that horses, sheep, bulls and hogs, not distin- 

 guishable from our domestic species, existed upon this continent, together with 

 the deer, the musk-rat, the beaver, the hare, the opossum, the tapir, which in 

 our days are peculiar to this continent, and not found in the countries where 

 our domesticated aoimals originated ? The whole matter might seem to admit 

 of an easy solution by supposing that the native American horse, sheep, bull, 

 and hog were different species from those of the old world, even though the parts 

 preserved show no specific differences; but this would be a mere theoretical 

 solution of a difficulty which seems to me to have far deeper meaning, and to 

 bear directly upon the question of the first origin of organized beings. 



The circumstances under which these remains are found, admit of no doubt, 

 bat the animals from which they are derived, existed in North America long 

 before this continent was settled by the white race of men, together with ani- 

 mals which to this day are common in the same localities, such as the deer, the 

 musk-rat, the opossum and others only now found in South America, such as 

 the_ tapir. This shows beyond the possibility of a controversy, that animals 

 which cannot be distinguished from one another, may originate independently 

 in different fauna, and I take it that the facts you have brought together are a 

 satisfactory proof that horses, sheep, bulls and hogs, not distinguishable at pre- 

 sent from the domesticated species, were called into existence upon the conti- 

 nent of North America prior to the coming of the white race to these parts, 

 and that they had already disappeared here when the new comers set foot upon 

 this continent; but the presence of tapir teeth among the rest show also that a 

 genus peculiar to South America and the Sunda Islands existed also in North 

 America in those days, and that its representative of that period is not distin- 

 guishable from the South American species. 



It would be desirable in this stage of the enquiry to compare your tapir teeth 

 with those of the species from Central America, which is considered distinct 

 from the Brazilian species. This circumstance leads naturally to the question 

 of the specific identity of all these animals with those now living in the same 

 locality, and with the domesticated species. And here I confess the difficulty 

 to be almost insuperable, or at least hardly approachable in the present state of 

 our science, when the views of naturalists are so divided as to what are species 

 among the genera bos, ovis, capra. For myself. I entertain doubt respecting 

 the unity of origin of the domesticated horses. But whatever be the final re- 

 sult of this enquiry, this much is already established by the fossils you have 

 collected, that horses, hogs, bulls and sheep were among the native animals of 

 North America, as early as the common American deer, the opossum, the 

 beaver, the musk-rat, etc. What remains to be settled respecting their specific 

 identity is involved in the controversy now carried on between naturalists, who 

 admit specific distinctions upon a very wide range of differences, and those 

 who limit them within narrow boundaries. But the final solution of this point 

 can in no way lessen the interest of your discoveries. 



Should you publish anything upon this subject, let me have your notice, for 

 I am deeply interested in the subject, as I always shall be, in everything you

Catalogue of Birds collected in the vicinity of Fort Tejon, California, with a 

 description of a new species of SYRNIUM. 



BY JOHN XANTUS. 



The following list presents the results of ornithological collections made in 

 the vicinity of Fort Tejon, in California, during a period embraced between the 

 end of May, 1857, and the beginning of November, 1858, about 17 months, and 

 including but one season of northward migration of the species. The 144 spe- 

 cies enumerated are not to be considered as all that belong to the region above 

 mentioned, as many birds are so rare, retiring, or difficult of approach, that 

 they can only be secured in a series of years. Many additional species of 

 rapacious and water birds were seen but could not be obtained, and though 

 many of these were readily recognized, I have not felt at liberty to mention 

 them in the list, which consists entirely of species actually collected within a 

 few miles of the Post, and now in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. 

 Of all the species collected, or observed, copious notes were taken relating to 

 the numbers, dimensions, habits, reproduction, &c. These will all be made 

 the subject of a special memoir hereafter, and I limit myself here to a simple 

 enumeration of species. 



It will be seen from the catalogue that the Fauna of Fort Tejon is essen- 

 tially that of the coast of California, as shown by the abundance of the Cali- 

 fornia Jay, Brown Pipilo, &c, Psaltriparus minimus, etc., and has only slight 

 relations to that of the interior or Colorado region. 



Some of the most interesting results of the collections made at Fort Tejon, 

 consist in the addition to science of several new species, as Syrnium occidental, 

 Empidonax Ilammondii, Vireo Cassinii, etc., and in the increase of the Fauna of 

 the United Srates by some Mexican species, as Selasphorus calliope, Dendrocygna 

 fiilva, &c. ; Helmintkophaga ruficapilla had not previously been found west of the 

 Rocky Mountains, while Carpodacus Cassinii was for the first time obtained west 

 of the Colorado river. 



It may be proper to state that Fort Tejon is a U. S. Military post, situated 

 near the Tejon Pass, at the head of the Tulare Valley, between the cascade and 

 coast mountain ranges of California, in about latitude 35 north, longitude 119 

 west. The height of the Post is about 4250 feet above the sea, and this alti- 

 tude with the proximity of higher mountains, gives to it a peculiar Fauna, in 

 many respects quite different from that of the low lands of the same parallel. 



It is an interesting fact, that while the Bighorn, (Ovis monlana,) and the 

 Missouri black- tailed or mule deer, (Cervus macrotis,) are abundant in the 

 vicinity, the common black- tailed deer of California (Cervus columbianus) is 

 seldom, if ever, met with. 



A comparison of the present list with that published by Dr. T. C. Henry, 

 U. S. A., of the species inhabiting the vicinity of Fort Thorn, in the upper Rio 

 Grande, and in the Rocky Mountain district, will be of particular interest, as 

 illustrating the differences in the character of the two regions. Dr. Henry's 

 loner residence at or near the post above mentioned, enabled him to exhaust 

 the ornithology of the country more fully than I could do, in a much less time, 

 his list reaching 198 species, while mine embraces only 144. It is, however, 

 quite probable that the uumber of Fort Tejon birds could not readily be brought 

 up much above 200 species, as the great elevation of the Post would make it 

 little liable to the visits of many water birds, or of the land birds requiring 

 a hot climate and low country.

Sp. Char. A little smaller than S. nebulosuvi ; general color liver brown, the 

 feathers barred everywhere, even on the flanks. Axillars and under wing and 

 tail coverts banded transversely with white, the bands towards and on the head 

 are contracted into rounded spots. 



General appearance t' at of S. nebiilosum. Prevailing color light liver brown, 

 each short feather with two transverse bars of white, the basal one tinged with 

 rufous yellow ; the subterminal pure white and not generally extending to the 

 edges of the feathers. These bars have a marginal suffusion of brown darker 

 than the ground color. On the top of the head and neck the subterminal bar 

 exhibits a tendency to contraction into rounded or cordate spots, and in other 

 places to a median interruption along the shaft. On the scapulars, axillars and 

 other elongated feathers, there are several white bars. The facial disk is gray- 

 ish, obscurely barred with brown, the posterior margin of the ear is uniform 

 liver brown, then becoming banded with white. The longest quills and tail 

 feathers show about 7 to 9 clouded transverse light bars, one of these at the 

 end of the feather ; those bars on the inner and outer margins are quite white, 

 especially towards the base of the feather, elsewhere they are mottled yellowish 

 brown, or brownish yellow; the legs are dirty yellowish, with obscure and 

 rather transverse mot' lings of brown. The bill is greenish yellow ; the iris 

 gamboge : the claws horn color ; the toes are thickly feathered to within two 

 scutellce of the base of the claws. The fourth quill is longest, the fifth and then 

 the third a little shorter, the second between the 6th and 7th ; the first rather 

 shorter than the eighth. 



Length of male 18 inches ; extent 40 ; wing 13 ; tail 8=} ; tarsus about 2. 



This species, with a general resemblance to the Syrnium nehitlositm, is of rather 

 smaller size, and readily distinguished by the entire absence of any of the lon- 

 gitudinal brown stripes so conspicuous on the belly, flanks and lower tail 

 coverts of the latter species; these regions being barred transversely with white 

 and brown. The white bars on the feathers are much less continuous and 

 regular, and on the neck and head are restricted to rounded spots instead of 

 forming regular zones. The under wing coverts are banded transversely in- 

 stead of being uniform yellowish white. The bill is less pure yellow. 



A single specimen (original number 1588) was collected at Fort Tejon,

Dr. Leidy read a letter from Dr. G. J. Fisher, dated at Sing Sing, New York, 

 .giving an account of an antler of the Reindeer, which had been found in the 

 vicinity of the place mentioned. The specimen was discovered in excavating 

 a peat bed, at the depth of six feet from the surface. The peat bed is almost 

 an acre in extent, surrounded by high ground, and looks as if it had been the 

 site of an ancient lake. Dr. L. observed that there is a similar specimen of an 

 Untler of the Reindeer in the museum of the Academy, which had been found 

 near Vincentown, New Jersey, at the depth of four feet. See Proc. 1858, 179. 

 The discovery of these remains of the Reindeer, and likewise of the remains 

 of the Walrus, in similar positions in New Jersey, (See Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. 

 xi. 83,) favor the view that the arctic fauna at one period extended its boun- 

 dary much more southerly than at present. 



Dr. Leidy further exhibited a drawing of a singular and beautiful animalcule, 

 which he had obtained in his recent visit to Newport, Rhode Island. The animal- 

 cule occupies a green, curved, vase-like tube, attached to dead shells, in com- 

 pany with Serpulae, which were dredged by Mr. Powel from Newport harbor. 

 The vase-like tube has an oblong oval, prostrate body, an erect, narrow neck, 

 and an expanded, convolvulus-like mouth. The body of the animalcule is 

 dark bottle green, and presents the same general structural appearance as the 

 Stentors. From the body projects a funnel-shaped expansion, dividing into 

 two lips like a labiate flower. The margins of the lips and the interior of the 

 funnel are ciliated ; and both lips are capable of closing, and with the funnel 

 are retractile within the tube of the animalcule. The size of the latter is al- 

 most the fifth of a line in length ; and it appears to be allied to the Stentors, 

 and more nearly resembles the Chsetospira Mulleri Lack man}}, than 

 any other animalcule Dr. L. had seen described. It was named F r e y i a Ame- 

 ricana.

Description of a type of GOBIOIDS intermediat3 between Solinse and 



Tridentigerinae. 



BY THEO. GILL. 

 EVORTHODDS Gill. 



Body elongated, anteriorly subcylindrical, slowly declining to the caudal. 

 Scales regularly imbricated, extending forwards to the eyes ; those of the sides 

 with pectiniform borders ; those of the anterior part of the back cycloid Head 

 thick, abbreviated, subquadrate in profile, above transversely convex, anteri- 

 orly truncated. Eyes large, approximated and wholly in the anterior half of 

 the head. Mouth moderate. Tongue thick and stout, but not wide, anteri- 

 orly free, and with the margin entire. Teeth uniserial, compressed, straight, 

 with parallel borders and emarginated crowns ; those of the lower jaw nearly 

 horizontal. Dorsal fins entirely disconnected ; the first with anterior rays 

 slightly filamentary, the second oblong. Caudal and pectorals rounded. Ven- 

 trals infundibuliform, with the interspinal membrane low. 



This genus is well distinguished by its dentition, and appears to thus con- 

 nect the true Solince, whose teeth are acute, with the Tridenligerince, in which 

 they are tridentiform. The sub-family of Tridentigerince includes two genera, 

 both of which are peculiar, as far as is known, to the Pacific ocean. In Tridenti- 

 ger, Gill, there is behind the row of tridentiform teeth of each jaw, a row of 

 simple acute ones. In Trkenophorus,* Gill, simple teeth only are behind the 

 tridentiform ones of the lower jaw. Both of those genera also differ from 

 Evorthodus as well as from each other in the form of the head. 



EVORTHODUS BREVICEPS Gill. 



The body regularly declines from the first dorsal to the end of the second ; 

 at the former point, the height is a sixth of the extreme length, and the least 

 height is an eleventh of the same. From the dorsal to the snout, the outline 

 is evenly curved. 



The short head constitutes about a sixth of the extreme length ; its greatest 

 breadth and width are nearly equal to each other, and each bears a proportion 

 to the length of about thirteen to seventeen. 



The eyes are situated entirely in the anterior half of the head ; the diameter 

 of an orbit equals a third of the head's length; the interorbital space is 

 narrow. 



The mouth is extended very little backwards. 



The anal fin commences under the second or third ray of the second dorsal, 

 and has (sometimes) one more ray than that fin. 



The caudal, when expanded, has a rounded margin, and forms a fourth of 

 the total length.

Description of a new South American type of SILUROIDS, allied to Callophysus. 



BY THEO. GILL. 



PlMELETROPIS Gill. 



Body naked, moderately elongated and compressed, tapering to the caudal. 

 Head cuneiform in profile, depressed and ovate above, and sloping rapidly 

 outwards. Supraoccipital extended longitudinally backwards, but not con- 

 nected to a dorsal buckler. Eyes submedian and oblique. Barbels six, con- 

 sisting of the maxillary and two pairs of mental. Branchial apertures large 

 and continuous under the throat Branchiostegal rays generally eight. Mouth 

 moderate and terminal ; upper jaw slightly protruding. Teeth uniserial, 

 wide, straight and truncated. Lateral line straight and extending to the 

 caudal ; anteriorly with lateral branches. Dorsal fin quadrangular, elevated 

 anteriorly, and with its first ray simple and slender. Adipose fin elongated 

 and cariniform. Anal fin similar in form to the dorsal, and under the adipose 

 fin. Caudal fin deeply emarginated, and with equal and pointed lobes. Pectorals 

 pointed, and with the superior ray simple and slender. Ventrals with the 

 second ray longest. 



Pimeletropis agrees in almost all of its essential characters with Callophysus 

 of Muller and Troscbel, but differs in the presence of the single row of teeth 

 in each jaw. The same character, in connection with others, distinguishes it 

 from Pimelenotus Gill. 



Pimeletropis lateralis Gill. 



The elongated and slender body is highest under the dorsal, and from its , 

 termination the dorsal outline commences to slope backwards to the end of 

 the long adipose fin, under the first half of which it is slightly curved, and 

 then nearly straight ; the caudal peduncle is slender and elliptical, but at the 

 base of the caudar fin it appears compressed and expanded superiorly and 

 inferiorly, from the recurrence of the rudimentary rays of the fin. The 

 greatest height is about a sixth of the entire length from the snout to the 

 concave margin of the caudal fin ; that of the peduncle is little more than a 

 third of the former. 



The lateral line is perfectly straight, and is anteriorly furnished with diverg- 

 ing branches, which tend obliquely and posteriorly. 



The head is above of an oval form, and declines to the region of the poste- 

 rior nostrils, in a slightly concave line, to the eyes ; the sides are posteriorly 

 rounded near the skull, and thence descend obliquely outwards to the opercu- 

 lar margin. The head, from the snout to the margin of the operculum, forms 

 nearly a fifth of the total length, and its greatest breadth bears a relation to 

 this length of fourteen to nineteen. The width regularly diminishes from 

 this point to the angle of the mouth, where the proportion is as ten to nine- 

 teen. The snout is obtusely horizontally rounded, and the space between 

 the anterior and posterior nostrils is convex. 



The skin is mostly smooth, but papillae cover the space between the eyes 

 and over the fontanelle ; there are also a few meandering dermal grooves be- 

 low and behind the eyes. 



The supraoccipital process is linear, and four times longer than broad. 



The eyes are longitudinally oval and contracted by the skin ; the longitudinal 

 diameter within the skin exceeds a seventh of the head's length ; their ante-

rior borders are midway between the snout and opercular margin ; the distance 

 from each other is as seven to three, but the interorbital space is only as five 

 and a half to three. 



The roof of the mouth is studded with papillae, especially in a transverse 

 line on the palate. 



The lips are thick and minutely papillated. 



The maxillary barbels are attenuated at their ends, and extend to or beyond 

 the caudal base. 



The teeth are straight and compressed, with parallel sides, and imbedded in 

 the gums ; the distance between each is equal to its width. There are more 

 than forty in the upper, and more than fifty in the lower jaw. Behind the 

 teeth there is a papillated ridge, but no teeth. 



There are eight branchiostegal rays. 



A distinct pectoral pore is present. 



The dorsal commences behind the second fourth of the length of the fish, and 

 its anterior ray is longest, and almost equals the height of the body. 



The adipose fin is very long and abruptly truncated posteriorly ; it is dis- 

 tinctly striated, so as to present a finely rayed appearance. 



The caudal fin is deeply lunate ; its central rays form an eleventh of the 

 extreme length, and its longest are equal to a fifth. 



The pectorals are pointed, and equal a fifth of the length. 



The ventrals are shorter than the pectorals, and the second ray is longest. 



The following formula indicates the number and character of the rays : 

 1 1 



D 1, 5 ; A 4, 8 - ; C 19, I, 7, 8, I, 13 ; P I, 12 ; V I, 15.

The color is silvery beneath, and above merges into a light purplish hue. 

 Along the side there are a number of distinct, nearly round dusky spots. The 

 fins are pearly, opaque at the bases. 



The specimen from which this description has been taken, was presented 

 by Mr. A. Edwards to the Lyceum of Natural History, of New York. It was 

 obtained from the Amazon River, with Cetopsis candiru Ag., Enctenogoblns 

 bodius Gill, Sternojjygus macrurus M. and T., and other species. 



New genera and species of North American TIPULID2E with short palpi, with 

 an attempt at a new classification of the tribe. 



BY BARON R. VON OSTEN SACKEN. 



Little attention has been paid by former authors to the North American 

 species of the genera Limnobia Meig., and E ri op te ra Meig., and the 

 number of those already described is not at all in proportion to the great num- 

 ber of species of some other genera, which have been made known, (as, for. 

 instance, Tabanus, Anthrax, and the family of Asilidae.) 



In my Catalogue of the described Diptera of North America, published in 

 1858 by the Smithsonian Institution, not more than 23 species, coming within 

 the scope of the present publication, are enumerated.* The considerable 

 number of new species of this family contained in my collection of North 

 American Diptera, induced me to undertake their publication. 



It was only natural to expect that among so many new species, some new 

 genera would occur. Whosoever has paid any attention to the classification 

 of the Tipulidce with short palpi, knows how very imperfect this classification 

 is, and how the principal genera are established on the habitual and artificial 

 characters. It became necessary, therefore, before proposing new genera to 

 revise the old ones, and to establish them on better characters. I have attempted 

 this, but in judging what I have done, it should be borne in mind, that this

part of my task was in my purpose only a secondary one. I wanted to publish 

 new American genera and species ; in order to establish the former I found it 

 necessary to give more precise definitions to already existing genera ; I hope 

 these definitions will hold good ; but the grouping of these old and new genera 

 according to their natural affinities is the task of a monograpbist ; it requires 

 a study of the family in its totality, embracing the species from all parts of 

 the world ; what I have given in this respect is nothing but a temporary ar- 

 rangement, adopted here, because an arrangement of some kind was required. 



It would have been the task of a monographist, for instance, to define more 

 precisely the subdivision of the family of the Tipulidce terricolce in two tribes, 

 those with short, and tho=e with long palpi. This subdivision (first adopted by 

 Latreille in 1805, in the 14th volume of his Histoire naturelle des crustaces etdes 

 insectes, ) although excellent, is not sufficient, since there are intermediate forms 

 which it does not embrace ; the character itself, on which it is founded, cannot 

 stand alone ; in order to be made available, it must be supported by charac- 

 ters taken from other organs. (Among the Tipulidce with short palpi there are 

 some, like Pedicia, Amalopis, Arrhenica, etc., having the last joint 

 of the palpi much longer than the preceding, and showing in this way an ap- 

 proach to the tribe with long palpi.) 



Not pretending to write a monograph, I do not define more accurately the 

 group which forms the subject of the present paper ; I took it, as defined by 

 former authors, and I could do so the more readily as I have not met with any 

 form of doubtful position. 



Without entering into a detailed historical account of the generic and other 

 subdivisions established and subsequently given up by different authors within 

 the group in question, I will advert only to Macquart's attempt to subdivide 

 the genus Limnobia Meig., as it is the most important for my purpose. 



Macquart separated from Limnobia Meig., all species with a petiolate areolet, 

 and formed of them the genus Limnophila. Now, a more natural subdivision, 

 as will be shown below, is that founded, not on the presence or the absence of 

 the petiolated areolet, but on the presence or absence of the second radial area. 

 Nevertheless, Macquart's subdivision was very near the true one, because all 

 Limnobia? with one radial area are at the same time destitute of a petiolate 

 areolet, and most of those with tiro radial area? possess this areolet. I say 

 most of them, because there are a few species of Limnobias iciih two radial 

 arece and no petiolate areolet, and these species were most unnaturally united 

 by Macquart with the Limnobice with one cubital area. (The European Lim- 

 nobia sylvatica Meig., for instance, is one of them ; in Macquart's Histoire 

 naturelle des dipt/ res it is to be found in the genus Limnob ia Macq., to- 

 gether with L. modest a, morio, etc) This was the fault of his subdiv- 

 sion. 



in a paper published by me in the Stettiner entomologische Zeitung in 1854, 

 I have suggested that the presence of the second radial area, combined with 

 characters taken from the structure of the genital organs, lead to a more 

 natural subdivision. The classification, adopted in the present paper, is the 

 development of this suggestion. 



The bulk of the tribe Tipulce ivith short palpi, may be divided in two sections, 

 showing the contrast of characters expressed in the following two columns : 



* Limnobia {Pedicia) albivitta Wk., L. {Pedicia) contermina Wk., L. c inct i- 

 pes Say, ten uipe s Say, r o strata Say, ma cr oc era Say, a r gu s Say, fas c i p en-

 nobiorynchus canadensis VVestwood, Anisomera longicornis Walk., Erioptera 

 calopt era Say, and the European E. fascipennis Zctt. I omit the species from 

 the West Indies and Mexico ; I omit also Trichocera, no species of this genus having 

 been described by me here. The names printed in italics are those of species which 

 have been identified by me; the others are as yet unknown or doubtful.

II. 



I. 



One radial area. 

 Antennae, 14-jointed. 

 No distinct pulvilli. 

 Ungues, with, distinct teeth on the un- 

 derside. 

 No spurs at the tip of the tibiae. 

 Limn obi a 710b.

Antennae, 16-jointed. 



Pulvilli distinct. 



Ungues smooth on the under side. 



Tibiae, with spurs. 



Limnophila 



nob., etc. 



Tibiae, without 



spurs. 

 Erioptera 



Meig., etc. 



These characters do not exhaust the contrast : the structure of the mouth, 

 and that of the male genital organs, is different in both groups. 



The first column, and the two subdivisions of the second, contain thus the 

 characters of the three principal groups of the tribe. Among the 87 species 

 described on the following pages, 68, that is, nearly four-fifths of the whole 

 number, belong to these three groups, each of them containing about the same 

 number of species. I will call them Tipulae limnobiaeforra es (with 24 

 species), Tipulae eriopterae formes (with 25 species), and Tipulae lim- 

 nophilaeformes (with 19 species), thus deriving the names from those of 

 the typical genera. 



A fourth group has all the characters of the second, as enumerated above, 

 except that the structure of the antennae is anomalous ; they have 6, some- 

 times 10, distinct joints, and often reach extraordinary proportions, being in 

 the rj 1 of some species three or four times longer than the body. Some other 

 characters, as the structure of the palpi, the presence of a tubercle on the 

 front, etc., justify the separation of this group. A fifth group also answers to 

 all the characters of the second ; but has, besides, a mediastinal cross-vein, 

 which is far remote from the tip of the mediastinal vein, and anterior to the origin 

 of the petiole ; pubescent eyes; a distinct tubercle on the front, behind the antenna, 

 and the 4th joint of the palpi elongated ; I call them Tipulae pediciaeformes. 

 The structure of the rj 1 genitals and the neuration of the wings, (especially the 

 form of the discal areolet) in this group, seem'to indicate a transition towards 

 the Tipulos with long palpi. The genera Amalopis and P e d i c i a are the 

 types of /the group ; Dicranota is closely related to them, although it has 

 13-jointed antennae and short palpi ; Ula is only provisionally placed in this 

 group on account of its pubescent eyes, the position of its mediastinal cross- 

 vein, etc. 



We have seen that the first group reproduces the characters enumerated 

 above in the first column ; that the second and third group answer to the 

 characters of the second column ^ the fourth and fifth group, although some- 

 what anomalous, show a decided prevalence of the characters of the second 

 column. But there are several genera which possess some of the characters of 

 ihefirst and some others of the second column at the same time, so that they have 

 no more relation to the one than to the other. They have, for instance, one 

 radial area and 16 (instead of 14) joints of the antennce; the structure of their 

 genital organs holds also the middle between the typical forms of the first and 

 second group, with more apparent analogy to the second. But besides this 

 anomalous combination of characters, each of these genera shows some pecu- 

 liarity of structure, for the most part, so striking, that it appears at once very 

 natural to isolate them from all other groups. I have gathered them all in a 

 sixth group, which I have placed between the first and the second, under the 

 name of Tipulae anomalae. This -group is entirely artificial, and, for this 

 reason only provisional.* 



* It will be seen below, that the four genera placed in the group alluded to, have all 

 one radial area and spurless tibim. But, among the species of my collection, which re- 

 mained undcscribed on account of too small number of specimens, there is one which 

 has one radial area and distinct spurs at the tip of the tibim, and thus combines again the 

 characters of the two opposite columns.

200 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



In an appendix, I describe an interesting new genus P r o t op 1 as a, and 

 a new species ofPtychoptera Mtig. These two genera, as well as B i 1 1 a- 

 comorpha Westw., are related to each other, and seem to form a distinct 

 tribe, belonging neither to the Tipulae with short, nor to those with lougpalpi. 

 It deserves to be observed that such intermediate groups, combining the char- 

 acters of two or more larger divisions, groups small in number of species, but 

 singular and anomalous in structure, contain most of the forms which the living 

 fauna has in common with the fossil one. Thus Protoplasa is closely re- 

 lated to the fossil genus Macrochile Loew ; thus Elephantomyia 

 (among my Tipulas a n o m a 1 se) is closely allied to Toxorhina Loew, which 

 has been found living, as well as fossil; thus Rhamphidia of the same 

 group, occurs very frequently as fossil ; and it is not at all improbable, that 

 my genera A n t o c h a and Dicranoptycha will be found fossil in the 

 Prussian amber. Another circumstance worth noticing is, that so many of the 

 fossil forms, now extinct in Europe, should be found living in the New World. 

 This observation is not confined to the T i p u 1 i d ae only : Professor Loew men- 

 tions, in a recent letter to me, that he had repeated it in the Dolichopodae. It 

 is well known that similar facts have been recorded in other branches of Zoo- 

 logy, as well as in Botany. 



Many new species and even new genera remain undescribed in my collection, 

 either because I have not been able to procure a sufficient number of specimens, 

 or because I had no fresh specimens for examination. It will be noticed that at 

 the end of every description I have mentioned the number of specimens which 

 I had for comparison. The importance of this datum scarcely needs an ex- 

 planation : it is evident that the more specimens have been compared, the more 

 perfect the description ought to be ; and it is important for those who have to 

 determine specimens from descriptions, to be enabled to know how far the de- 

 scriber had the means on hand to draw a go'od description. In a very few in- 

 stances only I have ventured to describe a species from a single specimen ; and 

 that in such cases only where the characters of the species seemed striking 

 enough to secure its recognition. Another important rule to observe, is the 

 study of fresh and even living specimens. The structure of the (J 1 genital organs 

 can be studied on such specimens only; likewise, it is for the most part very 

 difficult to count the number of joints of the antennas, and to obtain a correct 

 idea of the form and the relative length of the joints of the palpi, unless from 

 living or recently killed specimens. 



Besides the number of specimens which I had for comparison, I have men- 

 tioned at the end of every description, the names of the persons from whom.1 

 have obtained them. I am exceedingly obliged in this respect for the generous 

 contributions of Mr. S. H. Scudder in Boston, Mr. A. S. Packard in Brunswick, 

 Me., Mr. Edw. Norton in Farmington, Conn., but before all to Mr. Roberf Ken- 

 nicott from Illinois, who put at my disposal highly valuable collections of Dip- 

 tera, m^de during his travels in the North Western pans of the Union. The 

 localities where I collected myself are designated by the abbreviation (nob.) 



Although nearly one hundred N. American species are known to me at pre- 

 sent, nearly all which would have been placed formerly in the old genera 

 Limnobia Meig. and Er ioptera Meig., the fauna in this respect is far 

 from being exhausted. Even now, when this paper is completed, almost every 

 ramble in the country procures me a new species, or, at least, some new fact, 

 deserving to be mentioned in the context. And if I determine upon the publi- 

 cation of this paper, it is only because I am compelled by circumstances which 

 leave me no other choice but to publish it as it is, or to give up its publication 

 altogether. 



Several European species have been found by me as occurring here and are re- 

 described under their old names. Having had no European specimens for 

 comparison, I have identified them partly from recollection, partly from existing 

 descriptions. It may happen also that among my new American species, some 



O 



ug. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 201 



will be identified afterwards with European ones. The question of the real or 

 apparent identity of American species with European ones, especially among 

 insects, is a very delicate one, and requires a special investigation. Until some 

 general principles are adopted in this respect, entomologists will have to depend 

 on approximation, and their decisions will always be more or less arbitrary. 

 In any event there is very little harm done in describing under a new name a 

 European species found on this continent. The important point is, to have it 

 well described, and if such is the case, its affinity or identity with the European 

 species will easily be found out afterwards. 



The terminology of the neuration of the wing, as explained on the diagram, 

 is for the most part that of Walker. I have introduced some changes, where I 

 could not follow him, as well as additions, where my purpose required it (es- 

 pecially some new names of the cross-veins). My terminology is in many points 

 perfectly arbitrary, but until a rational nomenclature of the neuration of the 

 wings, applicable to all families of D i p t e r a , is adopted, the monographer of 

 every family will be compelled to invent his own. There is no great harm in 

 this, if only the meaning of the terms is clearly explained. 



The terminology of the other parts of the body required almost no changes ; 

 there was only the thoracic portion between the suture and the scutelium, which 

 had no peculiar name in the former descriptions. I call it scutum of the meso- 

 thoraz, or simply scutum, following in this the nomenclature expounded by 

 Westwood in Griffith's Animal Kingdom, vol. xv. p. 722, tab. cxxii. Ac- 

 cording to the same authority, I call prezscutum of the mesothoraz, or sim- 

 ply prcescutum, the upper thoracic portion between the collare and the su- 

 ture. 



Not having been able to give figures of the wings of the different species, I 

 have supplied their place by frequent references to the plates in Meigen's, 

 Schummel's* and Walker's works, as well as by descriptions of the neura- 

 tion. 



The circumstance that the genital organs of the male L im no b i ae can be 

 drawn from living specimens only, prevented me from replacing my hand by 

 that of a more skilful draughtsman. I appeal, therefore, to the indulgence of 

 my colleagues in Dipterology. 



My friend Dr. John L. Le Conte has kindly volunteered to correct the proofs 

 of this paper, which will be published during my absence, and I tender him my 

 most cordial thanks for this mark of friendship.

(L i m n o b i a Meig , ex parte, inclusive of R h i p i d i a Meig., G e r a n o- 

 myia Hal , and Dicranomyia Steph.) 



One radial area. Antennae 14-joiated, (sometimes apparently 15-jointed, 

 the cylindrical prolongation of the last joint appearing in some species as an 

 independent joint). Ungues armed with teeth ou the under side. Tibia? with- 

 out spurs at the tips. Pulvilli indistinct or none. 



The proboscis is always elongated, cylindrical, although generally shorter 

 than the head; in Geranomyia alone (1st Section) it reaches extraor- 

 dinary proportions. The $ genitals vary in structure in the different sections 

 of this genus; but all their forms have one character in common, and that is, 

 the great development of the anal style, situated immediately under the forceps. 

 (This organ is designated by the letter e on the figures 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc., of the 

 plate.) 



The group thus characterized, although very natural, comprises various forms 

 on which new subdivisions may be established. But there is no reason to 

 isolate some of them, leaving the others under the old generic denomination. 

 The genus, as defined above, is so compact, that either it must remain in its 

 integrity as a group of higher order, or the whole of it must be subdivided into 

 subordinate groups. This rule has not been observed in former works. 



The genus Rhipidia has been established on a European species with 

 pectinated antennae; the genus Geranomyia on several species with a 

 long proboscis ; but both R h i p i d i a and Geranomyia have more affinity 

 to some species which remained in the genus L imnobia (especially to those 

 which form my 3d Section, Dicranomyia Steph.,) than these species have 

 to their neighbors of the same genus, (to the L i m n o b i ae of my 5th Section.) 



The pectinated or moniliform antennas of R h i p i d i a are a character of 

 altogether secondary importance ; that is they do not indicate a corresponding 

 modification in the rest of the organization. The inconstance of this character 

 is alone sufficient to prove its secondary value : in Rhipidia maculata the 

 antennae are pectinated in the male and moniliform in the female; in Rhipidia 

 domestica n. sp. they are moniliform in both sexes. Such a character may 

 be used in the classification, but it must be subordinate to more important 

 characters. 



In Geranomyia likewise the length of the rostrum, although a very good 

 generic character, has apparently but little influence on the rest of the organi- 



[Aug. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 205 



zation, and should also remain subordinate to more essential characters. (In 

 the same manner the immense proboscis of L inin o b i or b y n c h u s does 

 not prevent it from having the closest affinity to some Rhamphidije, for 

 instance to my Rh. brevirostris with a comparatively short proboscis ) 



Not being able, on account of the scarcity of my materials, to attempt a final 

 partition of the group Limnobia in its present definition, I retain it in its 

 totality as a group of higher order and subdivide it in sections, some of which, 

 (as Rhipidia, Geranomyia, etc.,) are genera already previously estab- 

 lished, and which will also be retained in future, and others are only temporary 

 divisions, adopted for want of better ones. The 5th Section especially is not 

 sufficiently defined. 



Limnobia in its present definition almost corresponds to Limnobia 

 Macq. But, besides that it now includes Rhipidia and Geranomyia, it 

 has been freed from those species, which, like my Limnophila quadrata and 

 L. 1 e n t a have two radial area, and no petiolate areolet, and which Macquart, very 

 erroneously, separated from his genus Limnophila, where they belong, 

 and included in his L i m n o b i a, where they are strangers. (See more about 

 it in the preface and in L i m n o p h i 1 a.)

Geranomyia Halid. 



Proboscis slender, longer than the head, prolonged in a haustellum, which

is longer than the antennae ; it consists of a linear, very long lingua, and au 

 equally long labium, divided from the base in two branches ; palpi very short, 

 near the tip of the proboscis, but at a considerable distance from the tip of the 

 haustellum.* 



The other characters of the genus agree with those of the 3d section, (Dicra - 

 n o m y i a Sleph.) The forceps of the male has the same structure ; the habits 

 seem to be the same, both genera being found in damp situations. 



This genus was formed by Haliday, in 1833, on a European species, the only, 

 I think, at present known from that part of the world. The American continent 

 seems to be more abundant in Geranornyiae. Dr. Loew published six species 

 from Brazil, Chili, and the West Indies, and Mr. Walker one from Brazil. I 

 have found three species within the United States. 



Macquart's genus A p o r o s a, (established in 1838), is identical with G e r a -

The other characters, as well as the neuration of the wings, and the form of 



the (^ forceps (see the figures 8 and 9 of the plate) agree with my 3d section, 



(Dicranomyia Steph.) 

 I have altered the generic character of this genus as it was adopted by 



Meigen ("antennae maris bipectinatae"), in order to include in it two new 



species, which are closely allied to R. maculata, but have moniliform 



antennae in both sexes.

 tips of the latter ; tip of tibiae brown. Abdomen brownish. Wings cinereous, 

 densely covered with pale greyish brown spots and small round dots ; four 

 larger and darker spots along the anterior margin; the 1st near the base, the 

 2d a little beyond it, the 3d near the origin of the petiole; the 4th at the tips

One of the 9 specimens is somewhat different from the others in the picture 

 of the wings ; the larger spots and the nebulosities on the cross-veins are very 

 dark; the smaller dots, on the contrary, are not so dense as usual, leaving 

 large hyaline intervals between them. 



Although I have no European specimens of Rhip. maculata for com- 

 parison, I do not doubt of the specific identity of the American specimens.

'id Section. 



Dicranomyia S'eph. 



Body slender; feet long and slender; wings narrow ; joints of the antennas 

 except the basal ones, oval-oblong, with short or moderate verticils, inserted 

 about the middle of the joint; the ^ forceps (see the figures 3, 4 and 5 of the 

 plate) consists of two soft, moveable, ellipsoidal or subreniform lobes, each 

 being armed on the inside with a short, curved, horny appendage having more 

 or less the shape of a bird's beak (I call it rostriform appendage) ; another 

 horny, long, slender, arcuated appendage {falciform appendage), is closely ap- 

 plied to each lobe; a linear, slightly curved anal style below those lobes. 



The neuration of the wings in the different species of this section is very 

 uniform (almost like Meig. i. tab. vi. fig. 5); some difference may be found only 

 in the position of the mediastinal vein and its cross- vein, and in the presence or 

 absence of the discal areolet. Its absence occurs very frequently ; it is some- 

 times a good specific character, and sometimes only an occasional variety. 



The habits of the species seem to be aquatic ; the larvae probably live in 

 water or mud ; the perfect insects are always found in damp situations. 



This generic name appeared for the first time in J. F. Stephens's Catalogue 

 of British Insects in 1829, and afterwards in Curtis' 's Guide in 1837. I am not 

 aware of any definition of it having ever been published.

halteres pale, knobs dusky; feet dark tawny, pale at base, brown ring at 

 tbe tip of femora often scarcely apparent ; tips of tibiae and those of tarsi 

 brown. Abdomen cinereous ; $ forceps pale tawny ; its structure like fig. 4. 

 Wings hyaline, faintly tinged with grey ; veins brownish, pale at basis ; costal 

 and subcostal pale ; stigma oblong, pale, distinctly clouded at the cross-vein ; 

 the mediastinal vein joins the costal nearly opposite the origin of the petiole ; 

 sometimes a little before or beyond it : the cross-vein is near its tip ; the great 

 cross-vein is generally a little before the discal areolet ; sometimes it is in one 

 line with the upper discal cross-vein. 



Eleven $ and six 9 specimens. 



Common near Washington in summer. I have also specimens from Mobile, 

 Ala., and Dalton, Ga., (nob.) and Wisconsin, (Mr. Kennicott). 



In one of the specimens the discal areolet, on one wing only, is open. 



In another specimen (a 9 ) * ne second externomedial areolet takes an ob- 

 lique direction and joins the first, forming by this a petiolate areolet. This 

 is the case on both wings.

Proboscis, palpi and antennae black ; joints of the flagellum subglobular, 

 becoming more elongated towards the tip ; verticils moderate ; front and vertex 

 dark cinereous. Thorax tawny ; the stripes brown, moderately distinct, more 

 or less confluent ; humeri yellowish, with a faint yellow, sericeous reflection ; 

 scutum, scutellum and metathorax brown, the first two with more or less 

 yellow spots ; pleurae brown, with pale spots ; halteres pale, knob infuscated; 

 coxae pale ; feet tawny, a pale ring close at the tip of the femora. Abdomen 

 tawny, with pale bands on the incisures ; tf forceps like fig. 3 ; ovipositor 

 of the 9 furruginous. Wings subcinereous, with darker shades of gray at 

 the tip, in the middle of the prsebrachial areolet, in the pobrachial, (along 

 the pobrachial vein) and in the first externo-medial (along the same vein ;) 

 the central cross-vein, all the discal cross-veins and the great cross-vein, are 

 clouded ; there is a pale brown spot at the margin of the petiole ; another, 

 larger and nearly round spot at the junction of the radial and cubital veins ; 

 stigma brown, nearly parallellopipeclal ; the mediastinal vein joins the costal 

 generally a little beyond, sometimes nearly opposite the origin of the petiole ; 

 the cross-vein is near its tip ; the great veinlet is generally a little before the 

 discal areolet ; the color of the veins is brown. 



Washington, Trenton Falls (nob.), Connecticut (Mr. Norton). Common in 

 damp, shady situations, especially in hollows having a spring at the bottom. 

 Compared twelve (<^, 9 ) specimens. One of my specimens has a stump of 

 a vein on the curve of the petiole. 



A variety of this species (consisting, perhaps, of immature specimens?) has 

 no clouds on the wings ; the stigma is brown, as usual. I caught them in 

 numbers at Sharon Springs, N. Y. Such specimens are easily recognized by 

 the pale tip of the femora, which is a very characteristic marl: of the species. 



D. stulta. Fusca, humeris, pleurisque pallidis, alis subcinereis, stigmate

 shining, almost confluent ; intermediate one extending over the collare, and 

 sometimes faintly capillary ; the lateral ones are extended over the scutum ; 

 scutellum and metathorax brown ; halteres infuscated, pale at base ; feet 

 brownish, pale at base. Abdomen brown ; <$ genitalia paler ; the rostriform 

 appendage is small, and has two erect bristles ; 9 ovipositor ferruginous. 

 Wings subcinereous, stigma oblong, pale; veins pale brown; the tip of the 



[Au 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 211 



mediastinal vein is opposite the petiole ; the mediastinal cross-vein is very 

 near its tip (the distance is slightly variable in different specimens ;) the great 

 veinlet varies its position (as in D. liber t a;) the upper discal cross-vein is 

 generally arcuated. 



Twenty-three tf and 9 specimens. Trenton Falls, N. Y. ; Berkeley 

 Springs, Va., and Quebec, Canada, (nob.) 



D. d i s t a n s . Very like D. s t u 1 1 a , but mediastinal cross-vein separated 

 from the tip of the mediastinal vein by a distance about equal to the length 

 of the first externomedial vein. The thorax is less shining, and appears 

 slightly yellowish sericeous ; length, lin. 2^3. 



I have 6 (^ and 2 ) specimens, all taken in Florida in March, 1858. 



Besides these specimens I brought five others from the same locality, distin- 

 guished from the former by the absence of the discal areolet, which is open, and 

 by the shortness of the petiole, which is not longer than the great cross-vein, 

 and originates at some distance beyond the tip of the mediastinal vein ; 

 the position of the mediastinal cross-vein is like in D. distans. Among 

 these five specimens there is a ^ and a 2 which I caught in copulation ; and 

 as they agree in the above mentioned characters, it would prove, perhaps, 

 that these are not merely accidental, but specific differences. 



D. pubipennis. Fusca, thoracis disco fusco-nigro, antennis palpisque 

 nigris, stigmate cinereo ; areolis apicalibus sparse pubescentibus ; long. lin. 

 3-3^. 



This species is also very like D. s t u 1 1 a , but it is easily distinguished : 

 1st, by its size, which is a little larger; 2d, by its color, which is darker, 

 especially on the thorax ; 3d, by some peculiarities in the neuration of the 

 wings ; the mediastinal vein reaches considerably beyond the origin of the 

 petiole ; the cross-vein is near its tip ; the distance between the cross-vein 

 and the origin of the petiole is about equal to the length of the discal areolet ; 

 the two cross-veins, which divide the stigma transversely, do not form an almost 

 straight line, like in D. s t u 1 1 a ; the lower cross-vein is arcuated, and ad- 

 vances a little towards the tip of the wing ; the apical part of the wing is 

 finely pubescent, which pubescence does not reach the central cross-veins. 



Eleven male and 9 female specimens, caught in May, 1S59, at Relay House, 

 (near Baltimore.) Five of these specimens (3 <^ and. 2 2) have the discal 

 areolet open ; one of them has it imperfectly closed.

 cated. Thorax ochraceous, paler on the pleura? ; collare and prsescutum with 

 a brown stripe in the middle which does not reach the scutum; halteres pale, 

 knob dusky ; feet pale tawny, coxas and basis of femora pale yellow : tips of 

 tarsi duiker. Tergum infuscated ; ^forceps pale. Wings with a slight yel- 

 lowish-cinereous tinge ; stigma elliptical, pale ; the mediastinal vein joins the 

 costal nearly opposite, or a little before the origin of the petiole ; mediastinal 

 cross-vein separated from the tip of the mediastinal vein by an interval a little 

 longer than the stigma; stigmatical cross-vein generally in a line with the 

 tip of the subcostal vein ; sometimes it recedes a little, and then the tip of 

 the subcostal is arcuated towards the radial vein.

Twenty-five $ 2 specimens. 



This species is not unlike the European D. modest a, which, however, 

 generally has a discal areolet, its absence being an exception ; on the con- 

 trary I have not found as yet a specimen of D. immodesta with this 

 areolet closed.

 fusco ; pedibus fuscis, femorum apice infuscato, alis hyalinis, stigmate in- 

 fuseato, areola discoidali aperta ; long. lin. 2\ 3. 



Proboscis pale ochraceous, palpi infuscated, antennae brown, pale at base. 

 Thorax brownish ochraceous, with three distinct brown stripes on the praescu- 

 tum ; the intermediate one extends over the coll are ; the lateral ones over the 

 scutum ; scutellum and metathorax brown in the middle ; pleurae with a large 

 brown spot near the intermediate coxae and several smaller, indistinct spots ; 

 halteres pale at base ; knob brown ; feet brown, coxae and base of femora pale; 

 tip of the latter brown, with a pale ring before it. Abdomen brown, posterior 

 margins of segments and genitals paler ; falciform appendages of the $ for- 

 ceps very large ; (fig. 5,) they are very striking in the living insect and when 

 their points touch each other, they form a kind of arch or bridge over both 

 lobes. (The name of the insect is derived from their sword-like appendages). 

 Wings slightly subcinereous ; stigma elliptical, more or less infuscated ; neura- 

 tion exactly like that ofD. immodesta. 



Fourteen $ $> specimens. Washington in June (nob.) 



If it was not for the structure of the ^ forceps and for the circumstance 

 that large numbers ofD. gladiator occur in localities where not a single 

 specimen of D. i m m o de s ta is to be found, and vice versa, I would have 

 taken the former species only for a darker variety of the latter. 



D. diversa. Pallide silacea ; antennarum flagello, halteribus, tarsorumque 

 apicibus fuscescentibus ; alis hyalinis, stigmate pallide infuscato ; venis fuscis; 

 long. lin. 2 2$. 



The abdomen is slightly infuscated, the genitals are yellow. Otherwise this 

 species is not unlike D. immodesta from which it is easily distinguished by 

 its smaller size, the presence of a discal areolet, the absence of the brown stripe 

 on the thorax, and the wings, which are purer hyaline. The mediastinal cross-vein 

 is, like in D. immodesta, at a distance from the tip of the mediastinal rein, 

 which is about equal to the length of the stigma. - 



Five $ and <j> specimens.

There is not much to add to this diagnosis ; the stigma is scarcely apparent, 

 being of the same pale yellowish color as the rest of the wing ; the mediastinal 

 vein joins the costal a little before the petiole : the cross-vein is not far from it3 

 tip (at a distance shorter than half the length of the stigma.)

4tk Section. 



Ungues with, several notches on the underside, (and not with long teeth aB 

 in the other sections of the genus.) Forceps of the <$ belonging to the same 

 typical form with that ofDicranomyia, but with more elongated, slender 

 lobes. (Fig. 1 and 2.)

Head cinereous ; front and vertex almost black in the middle ; proboscis, 

 palpi and antennae fuscous ; joints of the fiagellum subglobular, with short 

 verticils. Thorax cinereous with a yellowish reflection ; three dark brown 

 stripes on the praescutum, the intermediate one capillary ; the lateral ones ab- 

 breviated before, and extended over the scutum behind ; pleurae variegated 

 with brown ; halteres pale with black knobs ; coxae cinereous, feet brown, 

 base of the femora tawny ; a very distinct whitish ring at a distance equal to 

 its own width from the tip of the femora ; ungues with several small notches 

 on the underside. Abdomen blackish cinereous ; posterior margins of the 

 Segments paler ; genitals pale. Wings subcinereous, spotted with blackish 

 brown ; subcostal area infuscated at four intervals ; several spots, forming a 

 short band, along the central cross-veins ; series of small, round dots along the 

 middle of the areas ; a larger spot in the axillary area, at the tip of the axillary 

 vein ; stigma square. 



Common near Washington, especially in May. It occurs near running 

 water, and is often found on stones or rocks over which a thin sheet of water 

 is running. I possess the same species from the Trenton Falls and Quebec, 

 (nob.) and from Maine (Mr. Packard.) 



Compared 8 males and 4 female specimens. 



5th Section. 



(Limnobiae v e r ae.) 



Collare long, well developed ; joints of the antennae (except the basal ones) 

 elongated, subcylindrical, slightly incrassated at the base ; verticils long, in- 

 serted on the incrassation and before the middle of the joint;' ultimate joint 

 sometimes twice as long as the penultimate, and apparently consisting of two 

 joints ; feei stout ; ungues strong with a large tooth in the middle of tbe un- 

 der side and smaller ones nearer to the base ; wings long and broad ; the tf 

 forceps consists of two subcylindrical, coriaceous halves ; to each is attached 

 a pair of closely contiguous, curved moveable lamellae ; the outer lamella seems 

 to be horny ; the inner one is of a softer consistence ; they vary in size and 

 form in different species. (See the figures 6 and 7 of the plate.) The differ- 

 ence between their structure and that of the forceps ofDicranomyia seems 

 to be more apparent than real, and to depend entirely on the great distension 

 of the soft portion of the forceps in the latter genus ; the solid, horny parts 

 seem to have the same structure in both genera. Thus, inL. solitaria the 

 soft parts, marked ^*on the plate, might be the analogues of the large lobes of 

 Dicranomyia, only in a rudimentary state. 



The colors of this group are bright (generally ferruginous or yellow) with 

 well marked brown stripes and spots. The habits are terrestrial ; the larvae 

 live in decaying wood or fungi ; the perfect insect is found in localities where 

 these matters abound. (The larva of L. annulus, a European species of 

 this group, is described by Van Roser, as being, in shape and color, like a 

 common earthworm ; it lives in decaying wood ; that of L. xanthoptera, 

 another European species, has been found by Stannius and Bremi in 

 Agaricus.) 



The contrast between this section and the 3d (Dicranomyia) is great, 



1859.] 




214 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



and appears in the whole organization as well as in the habits of the species. 

 Still this contrast is not equally marked in all the species of the present sec- 

 tion. Its typical representatives are the European L. annulus, quadri- 

 maculata, etc., and the American L. cinctipes, solitaria, imma- 

 tura; next come the European L. xanthoptera and the American L. 

 indigena, trioCellata; finally the European L. macrostigma, 

 tripunctata, etc., and the American L. t r i s t i g m a. In these species, 

 the striking habitual characters of the types are softened down, and the con- 

 trast with Dicranomyiais weakened. The structure of the forceps of the 

 (J 1 undergoes modification in accordance with the rest of the body. 



For this reason I consider the establishment of this section as only provi- 

 sional, not having been able for the present to effect a better subdivision.

 underside of the head, reddish yellow. Collare yellow with brown spots ; pra?- 

 scutum with four black stripes ; the intermediate ones approach the collare 

 before and reach the scutum behind ; the lateral ones are abbreviated before 

 and extend behind over the scutum, the sides of the scutellum and the meta- 

 thorax ; there are some indistinct brown spots on the humeri and the pleura? ; 

 the ground color of the thorax (that is the interval of the stripes, as well as 

 the pleura?, ) has a pale yellowish sericeous reflection ; the anterior part of the 

 intermediate stripes has a. reflection of the same color ; halteres pale, with a 

 brown ring a little below the middle of the stem, and a brown spot at the base 

 of the knob ; feet ferruginous yellow ; femora with two brown rings ; the one 

 a little beyond, the other near the tip ; tarsi infuscated. Abdomen ferruginous 

 yellow ; segments of the tergum with black stripes on their posterior margins ; 

 lateral edge of the abdomen also black ; venter yellow ; genitals of 9 ferru- 

 ginous. Wings yellowish with brown spots and clouds ; four spots near the 

 anterior margin ; the first near the basis : second, at origin of the petiole ; third, 

 double spot, at the tip of the mediastinal vein and the origin of the fork ; 

 fourth, ocellated, at the tip of the subcostal vein ; cross-veins infuscated ; a 

 pale grey band, beginning at the anterior margin, near the tip, crosses the 

 apical area?, sends a branch across the discal areolet and expands into a large 

 diluted spot in the last externo-medial area ; several diluted pale grey shades 

 in the anal, axillary and subaxillary area?, leaving some pellucid spots along 

 the posterior margin.

Very like the preceding species, but showing the following differences : it is 

 smaller in size ; the femora, besides the two brown rings beyond the middle, 

 have a third one in the middle ; it is pale, although distinct, especially on the 

 anterior pair ; the lateral edges of the abdomen are black, but there are no 

 black stripes on the posterior margins of the segments ; there is a brown spot 

 instead of an ocellus at the tip of the subcostal vein ; the grey band at the 



[Aug. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 215 



tip of the wing and the diluted spots along the posterior margin are much 

 darker. 



Other differences, perhaps of less consequence, which I notice in my speci- 

 mens are : that the brown marks on the humeri are more distinct ; that the 

 brown spots on the pleura? are more numerous and darker ; that the base 

 and the tip of the halteres are pale, the whole intermediate portion being 

 dusky.

Proboscis and palpi infuscated; front yellowish cinereous; vertex infus- 

 cated ; antennae fuscous, first joint yellow ; the two or throe following yellowish 

 at base, infuscated at tip. Thorax yellowish ; a brown stripe on the collare ; 

 a pale yellowish stripe, limited on both sides, by brown lines, on the praescu- 

 tnm ; two lateral brown stripes, abbreviated before and extended over the 

 turn behind ; scutellum and metathorax pale yellowish sericeous both with 

 lateral brown spots ; pleurae pale yellowish ; halteres with brown knobs ; 

 coxae pale ; femora tawny ; a pale rins* beyond the middle, followed by a 

 brown one near the tip ; tibiae and tarsi tawny, infuscated at their tips. Ab- 

 domen yellowish ferruginous ; an indistinct brown band, formed by a series 

 of spots in the middle of the tergum ; genitals pale; their structure like fig. 

 6. Wings yellowish with brown spots and clouds ; an oblique spot extends 

 from the posterior end of the stigma to the origin of the fork ; the margin of 

 the stigma is more or less infuscated ; a small brown ring is formed by this 

 margin on one side, and the clouded cross-veins at the tip of the subcostal vein 

 on the other ; origin of the petiole infuscated ; a series of more or less numer- 

 ous brown dots runs along the disc of the praebrachial area, the most conspicu- 

 ous among them being generally those opposite the origin of the petiole : an- 

 terior part of the pobrachial vein clouded ; discal cross-veins and great cross- 

 veins slightly clouded ; a pale brown band across the apical arere ; posterior 

 margin clouded, especially at the tip of the pobrachial and anal veins, and in 

 the subaxillary area. 



Two $ specimens ; Trenton Falls (nob. ) 



A (J' specimen from Maine seems to belong to the same species ; but it dif- 

 fers by having a spot and not, a ring at the tip of the subcostal vein ; the spot 

 at the origin of the petiole is larger and confluent with the corresponding dot 

 in the praebrachial area ; there are but two dots, instead of a series of dots, in 

 this area, near the base ; the last three segments of the abdomen are infus- 

 cated ; the pale ring on the femora is less distinct. 



N. B. Besides the differences mentioned in the descriptions of L. ci n c t i pe s, 

 immatura and solitaria, each of these species seems to have a constant 

 distinguishing character in the structure of the fork, formed by the mediasti- 

 nal cross-vein with the tip of the mediastinal vein. In L. immatura the 

 lower branch of this fork, (joining the subcostal vein.) is longer than the 

 upper one, and arcuated ; the upper one (joining the costal vein), is short, 

 straight, and perpendicular. 



The contrary is the' case in L. solitaria; here the upper branch is 

 longer and arcuated ; the lower being short, straight, and perpendicular. 

 In L. cinctipes both branches are about of the same length. The spe- 

 cimen of L. solitaria from Maine agrees in this respect with the typical 

 specimens.

This species is very much, like the European L. tripunctata Meig.

DlCRANOPTYCHA nob. 



Antenna. 16-jointed, reaching the base of the wing in the (J 1 , and but little 

 shorter in the J; first joint cylindrical, elongated; second stout, obconical, the 

 four or five next oval, the following elongated; verticils moderately long. Eyes 

 naked, almost contiguous below. Proboscis short. Palpi short; second joint 

 short, stout, third a little longer, fourth not much longer than third. Feet long, 

 rather stout, pilose ; tibioz without spurs at tip; ungues smooth beneath ; pulvilli 

 distinct. Wings elongated, moderately broad, with one radial area; neuration 

 somewhat like Meig. I. tab. iv. f. 17; a discal and no petiolate areolet ; stig- 

 matical cross-vein apparent; mediastinal vein distinct, with the cross- vein near 

 its tip ; axillary vein short, with a distinct fold, having almost the appearance of a 

 supplementary vein, which runs from about the middle of the anal vein, down the anal 

 area, towards the posterior margin of the wing, but disappears just before reach- 

 ing it. 



$ forceps consists of two subcylindrical basal pieces, ending in two falciform 

 or unguiform horny appendages ; (6g. 12a shows the forceps ofD. nigripes; 

 fig. 13 one- half of that of D. s o b r i n a.) 



This genus is distinguished from L i m n o b i a nob. by the 16-jointed an- 

 tennas, the smooth ungues, the presence of distinct pulvilli and the structure of 

 the $ forceps, which approaches that of Limnophila nob. But it is sepa- 

 rated from the latter genus by having but one radial area. 



The peculiar fold in the anal area, mentioned among the generic characters, 

 exists in some other genera also ; but it is by far not so distinct and more 

 straight. Here, on the contrary, it is characteristic enough to have induced me 

 to derive from its presence the name of the genus. 



Dicranoptycha has one character in common with Antocha: it is 

 the peculiar iridescence of the wing, which, in both genera, seems to be due to 

 the great density and minuteness of the microscopic pubescence of the surface. 

 This iridescence is particularly apparent in D. germ an a, and less in the 

 two other species. 



D. germana. Fusco-fulva, alis fulvis, iridescentibus ; long. lin. 4 4. 



Head yellowish cinereous ; palpi brown ; antennae tawny toward the base, 

 darker towards the tip. Thorax brownish fulvous, posterior part of the prae- 

 seutum, the scutum, scutellura and metathorax with a cinereous tinge ; a line 

 of the same tinge al >ng the middle of the anterior part of the prrescutum. (This 

 tinge is generally more distinct in than in tf specimens) ; lower part of the 

 pleural with a hoary reflection ; halteres ochraceous ; feet ferruginous-tawny,

clothed with black hairs ; infuscated at the tips of femora, tibiae and tarsi. 

 Abdomen fulvous, more or less infuscated ; in tf specimens the last segment is 

 generally the darkest, the forceps being ochraceous ; in the 9 the whole ab- 

 domen is brown, the genitals being pale ferruginous. The wings ure of a satu- 

 rated fulvous tinge, with a peculiar bluish, opalizing reflation ; the veins are 

 fulvous and distinctly pubescent ; if looked at obliquely, the veins appear yellow 

 on a bluish ground. The neuration is described among the characters of the genus. 

 No distinct stigma. The stigraatical cross-vein is very near the tip of the sub- 

 costal vein ; the mediastinal vein reaches a little beyond the origin of the cubital 

 area; the latter is longer than the subapical area by about half the length of 

 the discal areolet ; the great cross- vein is a little before the middle of the latter ; 

 the upper discal cross-vein is generally straight, but in a couple of specimens 

 it is oblique and arcuated. In one specimen the petiole has a short stump of a 

 vein near its origin. 



Eight male and nine female specimens, caught near Trenton Falls, where 

 this species was very common in July, 1858. 



N. B. The description is drawn from dry specimens. Among the notes 

 which I took on living ones, I find the following character mentioned: "ab- 

 domen yellow, with five brown spots along the lateral margins at the incisures."

 hoary ; halteres pale ; knob slightly infuscated ; feet tawny, densely clothed 

 with a moderately long black pubescence ; coxae pale ; tips of the femora a 

 little darker ; those of tarsi brown. Abdomen cinereous ; venter paler; genitals

 is a fringe of black hairs along the apical margin, between the tip of the sub- 

 costal vein and the externo-medial veins ; the surface of the wing itself is slightly 

 infuscated along this fringe. Neuration almost like the preceding species ; veins 

 finely pubescent.

brownish ; two or three basal joints yellow. Thorax pale brownish yellow, 

 with light vestiges of an intermediate capillary and two lateral stripes ; pleurae 

 with a hoary reflection : halteres pale yellow ; feet pale yellow, pubescent, and 

 slightly infuscated at the tips of femora, tibiae and tarsi. Abdomen yellowish 

 tawny ; male forceps somewhat different from that of the preceding species, the 

 interior falciform appendage forming a simple and not a double curve, as in D. 

 nigripes; it is short and has some bristles at the tip. The wings have a 

 brownish-cinereous tinge, more yellowish along the anterior margin ; the 

 neuration is almost like that of the preceding species ; veins finely pubescent. 

 Single (^ and 9 specimens from Dalton, Ga. (July, 1859.) 

 A female specimen from the same locality is more brownish grey on head 

 and thorax. I am not sure if it ought to be considered as a distinct species. 



Antocha nob. 



Mediastinal vein indistinct, being closely applied to the subcostal vein.* No medias- 

 tinal cross-vein apparent. Petiole not arcuated near its origin, but straight, and 

 forming an acute angle with the subcostal vein. Anal angle of the icing almost square, 

 and, in consequence of this, the subaxillary area is nearly triangular. Excepting 

 these peculiarities, the neuration is like that ofDicranomyia Steph. ; that 

 is, there is one radial area, a discal, and no petiolate areolet. Antenna?- 16 jointed, 

 short (longer than the head, but not reaching the base of the wing) ; joints of 

 the flagellum subglobular ; last joint elongated ; all joints beset with short 

 hairs, the rf antennas being more thickly clothed with them ; verticils short. 

 Proboscis short. Palpi shorter than the head, first joint elongated, second and 

 third shorter, the fourth elongated. Tibia; icithout spurs at tip and without dis- 

 tinct pulvilli. Ungues with two small teeth near the base. Forceps of the (J 1 like 

 fig. 11, showing more analogy to the type ofLimnophila nob. than to that 

 of L i m n o b i a nob. 



The general appearance of the insects of this genus is very like that of 

 Dicranomyia. Antocha is related to all L i m n b iie with one radial 

 area, by the analogous neuration of its wings and the structure of the feet, (no 

 spurs, no pulvilli and toothed ungues). But it is dis'inct from them and approaches 

 the Limnobiae toith two radial arcce (Limnophilae, etc.) by the number of 

 joints of the antennae, and, apparently, by the structure of the ^ forceps. 



The wings of both species described below have a peculiar milky-whitish 

 tinge; they are distinctly iridescent, when held obliquely towards the light. 

 Besides, they show another peculiarity: it requires a magnifying power of 150 

 to discover the microscopic pubescence on their surface ; so magnified, they 

 appear covered with black dots, emitting very short hairs. (Much less power 

 is required to show the pubescence on the wing of most of the other L i m- 

 n ob iae.) 



The name of the genus is derived from its principal charac*er, the proximity 

 of the mediastinal and subcostal veins. 



A. saxicola. Cinerea, antennis, pedibusque fuscis ; coxis, femorum,

Head cinereous ; proboscis yellow ; palpi and antenna? black. Thorax cinere- 

 ous, with several tawny, more or less distinct spots on the collare, the humeri 

 and the pleurae; praescutura yellowish cinereous, with three fuscous, almost 



* In order to ascertain this peculiarity of ihe neuration with more precision, I com- 

 pressed a wing of A. saxicola between two glass plates. This straightens the fold 

 usually existing in the L i m n o b i a between the costal and subcostal veins and shows ihe 

 course of the mediastinal vein with greater distinctness; in this c^se this vein appeared 

 separated from the subcostal by a narrow inlerval for about one-third of its length only ; 

 beyond that both veins ran close alongside of each other, till costal, subcostal and medi- 

 astinal converged in a stout and elongated anastomose. Under such circumstances there 

 was evidently no room for a mediastinal cross-vein.

 before and extended over the section behind. (In some specimens scutum and

 black ; coxae pale yellowish-tawny, tinged with cinereous ; base of femora 

 also pale. Abdomen cinereous ; . <$ forceps tawny, (fig. 11); 9 ovipositor fer-

 as the veins in that quarter, pale yellow. 



Numerous male and female specimens caught near Washington on the 19th of

 fuscous. Thorax ochraceous, with three pale brown stripes, the lateral ones 

 sometimes indistinct ; halteres pale, knob slightly dusky ; feet tawny, slightly 

 infuscated at the tip of the femora ; coxae and base of femora pale. Abdomen 

 brownish; genitals paler. Wings like those of A. saxicola; they have a 

 still more milky, opalizing tinge ; their base is likewise pale, etc.; the color of 

 the veins, especially near the costa, is more yellowish.

The specimen from Montreal has black veins on the wings and fuscous feet,

 gether pale feet. 



ELEPHANTOMYrA nob. 



Proboscis almost as long as the body, very slender , filiform arcuated ; palpi inserted 

 at the tip of the proboscis ; first joint very short and almost coalescent with the 

 second ; both together are much longer than the third, the fourth a little 

 shorter, (conf. Prof. Loew's figures of the palpi ofToxorhina in Lin. Ent. 

 v. tab. ii.) Antennae apparently* 15-jointed, longer than the head, but hardly 

 reaching the base of the wings; first joint cylindrical, short ; second stout; 

 third oval, stout, the following joints subcylindrical, and more elongated towards 

 the tip of the antennae ; joints of the flagellum clothed with long verticils. Eyes 

 large, naked ; front narrow. Collare prolonged in a narrow, almost linear, 

 although moderately long neck. Feet long, slender, without spurs at the tips of 

 the tibia?. Pulvilli indistinct or none. Ungues without teeth on their under 

 side, broad at the base. Wings (somewhat like Meig. i. tab. vi, fig. 6,) with 

 one radial area, a discal and no petiolated areolet ; mediastinal vein and cross- 

 vein distinct; no stigmatical cross-vein; anal and axillary veins united by a little 

 cross-vein near the root of the wing. Forceps of the male consisting of a basal 

 piece and two falciform horny appendages, (fig. 12 represents one-half of the 

 forceps.) Ovipositor of the long, slender and pointed. 



The only species of this genus is the Limnobiorhynchus canadensis 

 described by Mr. Westwood in the Annates de la Socie'te' Entomologique de France, 

 1835, p. 683. I have to explain the reasons which induced me to form a new 

 genus of this species. 



Mr. Westwood has described two species of Limnobiorhynchus: the 

 (-J 1 and 9ofL. brasiliensis and the tf only ofL. canadensis. When, 

 therefore, he mentioned among the generic characters of Limnobiorhyn- 

 chus that the wings of the female differ from those of the male by having the radial 

 and cubital area coalescent in consequence of the obliteration of the radial vein, he 



* The incrassated third joint of the antennas seems to derive its size from the coales- 

 cence of two joints, so that in reality the antenna; are 16-jointed. 



[Aug. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 221 



takes this character from the 9 of L. brasiliensis the only specimen he 

 had. The wing of the 9 of L. canadensis is exactly similar to that of 

 the J*. 



Prof. Loew's genus Toxorhina (Loew, Bernstein and Bernsteinfauna, 

 Schulprogr. Berlin, 1850, p. 37, and Linn. Entom. v. p. 400, Berlin, 1851, tab. 

 ii. f. 16 23,) comprising several fossil and one living species (from Jamaica) 

 agrees in its characters with Limnobiorhynchus: it shows the same re- 

 markable obliteration of the radial vein in the 9i their identity has been 

 already suspected by Mr. Loew himself. He seems to have had only 9 speci- 

 mens in his possession ; although not expressly mentioned in his descriptions, 

 this fact can be inferred from them. It is highly probable therefore that the 

 tf Toxorhina has, like the $ Limnobiorhynchus, a complete 

 radial vein, or, in other words, that these two genera are synonymous. Mr. 

 Westwood's name, as the oldest, has the priority. 



It remains to be considered now, whether the species canadensis Westw. 

 really belongs to Limnobiorhynchus (=Toxorhina) as defined 

 by Mr. Westwood and Prof. Loew. The specimens of said species, which 

 I have before me, do not agree with the definitions of these authors in the fol- 

 lowing points : 1st. The neuration of the wings is the same in both sexes. 2d. 

 The antennae of Limnobiorhynchus (Toxorhina), are distinctly 

 stated by both authors to have long verticils on the terminal joints only, form- 

 ing a kind of pencil at the tip ; the verticils on the other joints are said to be 

 much shorter. This is not the case with E. canadensis: the verticils are 

 of equal length on all the joints of the flagellum. 3d. The front of Toxorhina 

 is mentioned by Prof. Loew as broad. ("The eyes, at least in theQ, says he, are 

 separated on the upper side by a considerably broad interval.) On the contrary 

 the front is remarkably narrow in my specimens. 4th. "The thorax," says Prof. 

 Loew, " is distinguished by the horizontal prolongation of the metathorax." 

 Nothing of the kind is the case with my specimens. 5th. The anal vein in 

 To x o r h i n a Lw. runs into the pobrachial at a considerable distance from the 

 base of the wing; the little cross-vein which seems peculiar to this genus, 

 unites the axillary vein with the pobrachial. In my specimens the anal vein takes 

 its usual direction towards the base of the wing and the little cross-vein is 

 situated between it and the axillary vein. 



Under such circumstances I thought that the establishment, at least provi- 

 sionally, cf a new genus, with L. canadensis for its type, would be the 

 most warrantable course to pursue in order to prevent further confusion. 



E. canadensis. Pallide silacea ; thorace vitta infuscata, femorum apice

Head yellow ; probscis covered with a fine pubescence ; antepnae yellow : 

 verticils black ; basal joints, especially the second, more or less infuscated. 

 Thorax yellow ; a more or less distinct brown stripe runs along its middle and 

 down the collare, (in some specimens this stripe is altogether obsolete) ; halteres 

 pale ; feet yellow ; femora brown at the tip. Abdomen yellow; posterior mar- 

 gins of the segments brown ; a more or less distinct brown stripe runs along 

 the middle of the tergum ; the last joint is brown in the tf ; the forceps are 

 tawny ; 9 ovipositor is ferruginous. Wings pale cinereous ; a slight nebu- 

 losity along the apical margin; stigma oblong, blackish brown ; no vestige of 

 Stigmatical cross-vein ; the mediastinal vein, as well as its cross-vein, are in the 

 middle of the distance between the stigma and the origin of the petiole ; the 

 latter is very short; discal areolet nearly square, the great cross-vein inserted a 

 little before its middle.

Rhamphidia Meig. 



Proboscis elongated, but shorter than the thorax. Palpi inserted at the tip 

 of the proboscis, of moderate length, last joint elongated ; front narrow ; an- 

 tennae 10-jointed, not reaching the base of the wings ; first joint cylindrical, 

 elongated ; second cyathiform, short ; the following joints subcylindrical short, 

 becoming more elongated towards the tip of the antennae ; verticils moderately 

 long. Wings with a distinct mediastinal vein and a cross-vein near its tip ; 

 one radial area, a discal and no petiolated areolet ; no stigmatical cross-vein. 

 (The neuration is like Meig. vol. i. tab. vi. f. 6, or Schummel, tab. i. f. 1.) 

 Feet long, slender ; without spurs at the tip of the tibiae ; ungues smooth be- 

 neath ; tarsi without distinct pulvilli. Forceps of the male somewhat similar 

 to that of Elephantomyia. 



I refer to this genus a male specimen from Wisconsin, which agrees with 

 the characters of Rhamphidia as given by Meigen and Walker (Ins. Brit. 

 Dipt. iii. p. 308.) Only Mr. Walker describes the tibiae as armed with very 

 short spurs. A careful examination convinced me that they are unarmed, al- 

 though there are some bristles at their tip which might be mistaken for spurs. 

 The absence of the stigmatical cross-vein, expressly mentioned by Schummel 

 in his description of R. longirostris (Schum. Limnobia, p. 103, ) is suffi- 

 cient in my opinion to settle the question of the generic identity. 



The close relation between this genus and Elephantomyia is evident. 

 The comparatively short proboscis, the structure of the palpi and of the 

 second joint of the antennae, seem to be the only differences. The neuration 

 of the wings, including the absence of the stigmatical cross-veins, is exactly 

 the same ; the little cross-vein between the pobrachial and anal veins, appa- 

 rent on the wing of Elephantomyia, is concealed by a fold in my speci- 

 men of Rhamphidia; still it can be distinctly seen by holding the wing in 

 a certain direction. R. brevirostris bears, besides, a most striking re- 

 semblance to Eleph. canadensis in the coloring of the body and the wings ; 

 the wing of the former is only a little more hyaline, and for this reason the 

 dusky spot at the tip is more apparent ; the stigma is less oblong, more square, 

 and the tibiae are black at the tip, whereas those of E. canadensis are not 

 even infuscated. 



The proboscis of R. brevirostris seems to be much shorter than that of 

 the European R. 1 ongiros t ris, (judging from the descriptions of the 

 latter. ) 



R. brevirostris. Silacea, praescuto et abdomine infuscatis ; alis hya-

 yellow ; praescutum infuscated ; the usual stripes but indistinctly marked ; 

 halteres pale ; feet pale yellow ; tips of the femora and tibiae black ; tips ot 

 tarsi also darker. Abdomen yellow ; the anterior part of the segments infus- 

 cated ; last segments and genitals fuscous. Wings hyaline, infuscated at tip ; 

 stigma brown, nearly square; the anterior part of the pobrachial vein ,also 

 infuscated ; veins brown ; costal and subcostal veins yellow. 



Single tf specimen, brought from Wisconsin by Mr. Ulke. 



This species might possibly be R. prominens Walk., (Dipt. Saund. v. p. 

 435) although the description disagrees in several points. Rhamphidia fi a v i- 

 p e s Macq., (Dipt. Exot. Suppl. v, p. 17,) is described as having thorax and 

 abdomen brownish ("fuscana ;") in other respects Macquart's description 

 agrees well with my R. brevirostris.

not reaching beyond the middle of the wing ; the mediastinal cross-vein at a 

 moderate distance from the tip of the mediastinal vein ; the subcostal vein 

 not much extended beyond the central cross-veins ; one radial area and no 

 petiolated areolet : the microscopic pubescence of the wing is distinctly seen 

 under a moderate magnifying power ; it is rather sparse, the wing appearing 

 for this reason pure hyaline and transparent. Antennae 1G -jointed, nearly 

 reaching the base of the wing ; first joint cylindrical, elongated, second short ; 

 flagellum, submoniliform, with oblong joints and long verticils. Proboscis 

 cylindrical, slender, elongated, although shorter than the head ; palpi at the 

 tip of proboscis short, last joint very short ; eyes naked, moderately remote 

 above, approximated below. Collare prolonged in a narrow, almost linear 

 neck, which is half as long as the head. Feet of moderate length, rather 

 stout, hairy ; no spurs at the tip of the tibia? ; pulvilli small. The forceps 

 of the male consists of two oblong lobes, somewhat like those of Dicrano- 

 myia : large horny appendages on their under side; anal style distinct, (fig. 

 10 represents the forceps of T. complexa from above ; fig. 10 a, one-half of 

 it from below.) Valves of the 5 ovipositor of moderate length, slender, 

 arcuated. 



Is easily distinguishable by its broad, clear wings, the shortness of the 

 mediastinal and subcostal veins ; the short, hairy feet, the stout, short tho- 

 rax, rising abruptly above the abdomen, etc. The 16-jointed antenna?, the 

 structure of the ungues, and the presence of the pulvilli are as many points 

 of analogy with Limnophila nob., the neuration of the wings (which have 

 bdt one radial area,) and the absence of spurs at the tip of the tibia? remind 

 on the contrary of Limnobia nob. Hence the location of Teucholabis 

 in the present intermediate group. Rhamphidia scapularis Macq. Dipt. 

 Exot. i. l,.pl. 10, f. 1, shows some analogy with T. complexa, especially 

 in the neuration of the wings.

covered with a short pubescence ; femora slightly incrassated at tip. Tibia?

 short basal pieces, of the usual horny appendages, one pair are very long, 

 slender, linear and slightly arcuated ; the other is short and stout ; 9 ov i- 

 positor elongated, slender, slightly arcuated ; the lower pair of valves is very 

 short and do not reach much beyond the origin of the upper pair, (fig. 18 a.) 

 This genus is very much like E r i o p t e r a in its general appearance ; the 

 body is rather short and stout ; the intermediate pair of feet is like in E r i o p-

 by its glabrous wings and the structure of the genital organs in the ^ and 9 

 The structure of the 9 ovipositor is somewhat analogous to that of S y m-

 of moderate length and breadth ; petiole very short and oblique, so that 

 the first radial area has the form of an almost equilateral triangle ; two 

 radial area? and no petiolated areolet ; the central cross-veins at the base of 

 the second radial, the cubital, the subapical and the first externo-medial area?, 

 form one line, being connected at their ends ; the stigmatical cross-vein (or at 

 least the vein replacing it) is the continuation of the same line ; the second 

 externo-medial area is shorter than the first ; the great cross-vein is a little 

 nearer to the tip of the wing than the other central cross-veins ; the mediastinal 

 cross-vein is a little anterior to the origin of petiole and very indistinct. For- 

 ceps of the $ somewhat like that of Antocha, but the falciform appen- 

 dages are small and, in the state of repose, so closely applied to the under side 

 of the basal pieces as to be indistinct. Ovipositor of the 9 obtuse, soft, 

 without any apparent horny lamels. (Fig. 14, 14 a and 15, 15 a male and 

 female genitals of C. paradoxa.) 



This genus is sufficiently distinguished from all others by the neuration of 

 the wings and the structure of the genitals. The absence of the horny lamels

 coxae and base of the femora pale ; their tips brown ; tibiae brownish-tawny,

 stigma ; veins brown, costal and subcostal pale yellow ; neuration as de- 

 scribed among the generic characters ; apical areolets slightly pubescent in 

 the middle. 



Twenty-one specimens taken at the White Sulphur Spings in Va., on the 

 30th of June, 1859. 



Erioptera Meig. 



Wings pubescent on the whole surface, or on the veins only ; two radial areae; 

 mediastinal cross-veins at a considerable distance from the tip of mediastinal 

 vein, although posterior to the origin of petiole, the latter nearer than usual to 

 the origin of the wing. Antennas with 16 joints. Proboscis and palpi short. 

 Tibiae without spurs at the tip. Pulvilli distinct. Ungues smooth. 



The pubescence of the wings is the most striking character of Erioptera; 

 still it is not sufficient for defining the genus, because U 1 a and several L i m - 

 n o p h i 1 a?, have also wings which are pubescent along the veins, or on the 

 whole surface. The characters enumerated above, especially the spurless 

 tibae, complete the definition. 



Erioptera, thus defined, is far from being homogeneous, and ex- 

 hibits among a comparatively small number of species more variety in the neu- 

 ration of the wings or the structure of the J, genital organs than either L i m - 

 nobiaorLimnophila, although these genera are much richer in species. 

 It has been observed already by Mr. Curtis, (Brit. Entom. 557,) that in some 

 Eriopterae the antennae of the % are much longer than those of the female, 

 and that such species show at the same time some peculiarities in the neuration 

 of the wings, and might therefore, with good ground, be separated from the 

 rest of the genus. 



My E.hirtipennis and pubipennis belong to the group thus de- 

 fined by Curtis. My E. ch,lorophylIa,vespertina,septemtrionis, 

 villosa, chrysocoma, etc., seem to form another natural group ; my E.

Symplecta Meig. 



The distinguishing character of this genus is the undulating axillary vein. The 

 absence of spurs at the tip of the tibia seems to indicate a relationship to E r i o p- 

 tera; at the same time it is a ground for separation from Limnophila, 

 Anisomera, etc. 



The $ forceps consists of two subcylindrical, coriaceous pieces with two 

 stout horny appendages attached to each of them (fig. 29, forceps of S.punc- 

 tipennis; the , 9 . ovipositor shows some analogy to that of Gnophomyia 

 in the shortness of the lower valves ; besides the ovipositor is armed on the tipper 

 side at the base with (too small teeth. This character, first noticed by Schummel 

 inS. punctipennis, &c, belongs also to several 9 Eriopterae. 



For details about this genus, I refer to Meigen, Walker, Zetterstedt, etc. 



Judging from the description of the European S. punctipennis Meig. it 

 would seem that the specimens which I caught in America belong to the same 

 species. I describe them, therefore, under the same name.

Cladura nob. 



Proboscis and palpi short ; last joint of the latter very stout. Front and 

 vertex convex. Eyes almost contiguous on the under side of the head. Antenna 

 16-jointed, of moderate length (reaching the base of the wings) ; first joint 

 cylindrical, second turbinated, the following joints subcylindrical, elongated, 

 slightly incrassated at the base, with moderate verticils. Feet long, moderately 

 stout, tibiae without spurs at the tip. Ungues small, smooth. Pulvilli distinct. 

 Wings long, neuration like Limnophila, with two radial arese and one 

 petiolate areolet. Veins with a short, hut distinct, pubescence on the apical 

 portion of the wing. Genitals of the tf large, stouter than the abdomen; the 

 upper side of the last abdominal segment is horny, convex, having a notch be- 

 tween two projecting points on the posterior margin; the forceps, which are 

 inserted below, are large, with a long, cylindrical basal joint. (See fig. 34 ; this 

 sketch is drawn from a dry specimen, and might not perhaps be altogether cor- , 

 rect ) Ovipositor of the 9 of the usual structure; the upper valves are flattened, 

 lamelliform towards the tip. 



In general appearance this genus is very like Limnophila, but it may be 

 distinguished at once by the absence of spurs on the tibice. It has this character, 

 as well as the slight pubescence on the veins of the wing, in common with 

 Erioptera; but its long feet and elongated wings give Cladura an alto- 

 gether different appearance. By its eyes, contiguous below, it reminds of S y m- 

 ple eta . In the structure of the tf genitals it differs from all other genera of 

 the group.

Proboscis, palpi and antenna? pale ferrugineous ; the two latter infuscated at 

 the tip. Praescutum ferruginous, shining; a more or less apparent dark line 

 in the middle ; a browa spot on the humerus ; pleurae pale yellow ; two brown 

 spots between the humerus and the base of the wing ; a third one lower, about 

 the middle of the pleurae; scutellum and metathorax ferruginous; a small 

 black dot on each side, between the latter and the base of halteres ; these are 

 pale ; feet hairy, yellowish ferruginous; tips of femora, tibia? and tarsi brown. 

 Tergum ferruginous ; lateral margins of segments brown, united by a pale brown 

 band running across the middle of each segment; venter yellow; genitals fer- 

 ruginous, shining. Wings yellowish ; costal, subcostal and pobrachial veins 

 ferruginous ; other veins brown ; cross-veins and origin of petiole clouded with 

 brown ; stigma pale ; a supplementary cross-vein about the middle of the cubital 

 area. 



Washington, D. C. October, November, (nob.) 



Compared seven tf and 9 specimens. 



In one of my specimens, there is a second supplementary cross-vein in the 

 second radial area on one wing, and in the subapical on the other. 



Besides the seven specimens described above, I have three from Massachusetts 

 (sent by Mr. Scudder), distinguished from the above described specimens by the 

 absence of the supplementary cross-vein in the cubital area. These three speci- 

 mens are smaller in size, and the cross-veins of the wing are scarcely clouded. 

 I doubt whether they belong to a different species, but still it is very remarka- 

 ble that all came from the same locality. In the mean time I have abstained on 

 their account from mentioning that supplementary cross-vein among the char- 

 acters of the genus as well as in the diagnosis of the species. 



Gonomyia Meig. 



Proboscis and palpi short; the joints of the latter nearly equal length. An- 

 tennae 16-jointed, of moderate length (not reaching the base of the wing.) Feet 

 long, slender ; tibia; without spurs at tip; ungues small; pulvilli distinct. Wings

(like Meig. i. tab. vii. f. 7 J of moderate length ; naked, with two radial and no 

 petiolate arete. The second radial area is very short, taking its origin about the 

 middle of the cubital; the upper branch of the radial fork runs obliquely towards the 

 anterior margin ; mediastinal vein short, joining the costal nearly opposite the 

 origin of the petiole ; discal areolet extant or wanting ; stigmatical cross-vein 

 wanting. Forceps of the J 1 (fig. 16 and 17, G. blanda and G. cogna- 

 te 1 1 a ,) consists of two moveable basal pieces, with four elongated appendages 

 attached to each of them ; these appendages are clothed with hairs or bristles, 

 and armed with spines. Ovipositor of the 9 moderately long, consisting, as 

 usual of two pairs of valves ; the upper pair long, arcuated. 



The peculiarities of this genus consist, chiefly, in the neuration of the wing, 

 the structure of the tf forceps and the coloring, in which the sulphur-yellow 



prevails. 



It is not easy to find for G o n o m y i a an appropriate location in the system ; 

 it stands as an isolated, sharply defined group, bearing no apparent affinity to 

 any other group of the family. The number of joints of its antenna, the smooth 

 ungues, the disinct pulvilli, and the presence of the second, although almost 

 rudimental, radial area, determined me to locate it, provisionally, in the same 

 group with Erioptera. 



The European Limnobia te n el la Meig. belongs to this genus. It wassent 

 to Meigen by Megerle under the name of Gonomyia tenella (conf. Meigen, 

 vol. I. p. 146). Mr. Stephens, in his Catalogue of British Insects, (1829), and 

 Mr. Curtis, in his "Guide." (1837), have again applied this generic name to 

 this species, but without defining the genus.

The various forms, contained in the group thus characterized, may be 

 arranged into several natural groups of lower order, most of which will be 

 erected at some time into new genera. Those among them offering characters 

 which require an immediate separation, have been supplied with generic names ; 

 bixt as long as the whole group is not subdivided into genera of an equal sys- 

 tematic value, it is preferable to leave all its subdivisions under a common 

 generic appellation. 



Limnophila in its present definition comprises all the species which 

 Macquart would have located in his genus Limnophila; but it contains 

 besides those, species with two radial area, but without petiolate areolet which, 

 in Macquart's distribution, belonged to his genus Limnobia; (compare

Antennae black, except the basal joints, which are tawny ; proboscis and 

 palpi black ; front above the antennae and lower part of the head yellowish- 

 ferruginous ; vertex black, shining. Thorax black, shining ; pleurae slightly 

 hoary ; halteres pale yellow, (the 9 specimen have a brown knob) ; feet dark 

 tawny ; coxae and base of femora paler ; tips of femora, tibiae and tarsi brown. 

 Abdomen black ; three or four intermediate segments with pale ferruginous 

 spots at the base (more distinct in living specimens) ; genitals ferruginous- 

 yellow. Wings hyaline, spotted with brown ; one spot near the base, in the 

 angle between the subcostal and pobrachial veins ; another square one, near 

 the origin of the petiole, between the same veins ; a third one between the 

 costa and the cliscal areolet ; the tip of the wing, as well as the discal cross- 

 veins, are clouded. In some specimens (for instance in my tf from Florida,) 

 a nebulosity extends along the pobrachial, anal and axillary veins ; it occu- 

 pies the whole extent of the arese between these veins ; the nebulosity at the 

 tip of the wing has, in such cases, also a greater extension. The neuration is 

 like Meig. i. tab. vi. f. 3, only the second radial and cubital areae are nearly of 

 the same length, the radial vein forking immediately beyond its origin. 



I found rf specimens quite commonly on the 2d of July, 1859, near the so-call- 

 ed Salt-pond in southern Virginia, (about 20 miles from the Montgomery White 

 Sulphur Springs.) Another tf specimen I caught in Florida, in March, 1858. 

 Of my three 9 specimens I found two near Washington, and received one 

 from Dr. Asa Fitch, of Salem, N. Y. There is a very strong probability that 

 these 9 belong to the same species ; but having never found both sexes in 

 the same locality, I cannot affirm it positively. 



N. B. Say commits a mistake when he compares the neuration to Meig. i. 

 tab. v. f. 7. Wiedemann quotes correctly Meig. i. tab. vi. f. 3.

N. B. Say's descriptions of L. tenuipes and L. humeralis are so 

 much alike that the choice between them was somewhat difficult in identifying 

 the present species. Still the words in the description of L. tenuipes "an- 

 tenna? long," and " wings dusky " determined my choice. Wiedemann took 

 both for synonyms ; but Say denies this synonymy in a manuscript note, which 

 still exists in a copy of Wiedemann's work, which he had used.

Three tf and two speoimens. Trenton Falls and Northern Illinois, (nob.) 

 Upper Wisconsin River, (Mr. Ulke), Maine, (Mr. Packard). The specimen from 

 Maine, although undoubtedly belonging to the same species, is distinguished 

 by a darker coloring of the wing ; the veins are brown ; the fuscous tinge at 

 the tip is more intense and extends much farther along the posterior margin ; 

 the pobrachial vein is infuscated ; the nebulae at the central cross-veins and at 

 the origin of the petiole are darker. In some specimens the stigma as well as 

 the infuscated tip of the wing are very pale brown.

 all cross-veins, origin of petiole, base of petiolated areolet and tips of anal and 

 axillary veins, clouded ; subcostal vein ferruginous ; other veins dark brown. 

 Cubital area a little longer than the subapical. The proportion between the 

 length of the petiolated areolet and its petiole is not constant; generally, the

 one of my specimens the areolet is more, than twice shorter than its petiole on 

 one wing, and it is altogether wanting in the other. A stump of a vein near 

 the origin of the petiole.

This species is very like L. t ox on e u r a in its coloring, but is easily dis-

The thorax of the normal specimens is not shining ; the front is slightly cinere- 

 ous ; but among the specimens which I collected in Georgia there are two or 

 three with a shining thorax and a brownish yellow front. They agree in all 

 other characters, and I hardly think that they form a distinct species.

 cross-veins, as far as the pobrachial vein ; the fifth nearest to the tip of the 

 wing, is very small ; the lower discal cross-veins and origin of the petiolated 

 areolet are also spotted ; veins brown, naked ; subcostal pale.

In some specimens the spots on the wings are much larger than in others 

 the stripes on the thorax are also more or less distinct. 



10th Section. 



(Subgenus Die ranophragm a nob.) 



Wings broad, posterior margin rounded; a supplementary cross-vein unites both 

 branches of the radial fork near their tip. Antennne hardly reaching the base of 

 the wings ; basal joint long, cylindrical : the second stout, rounded ; the fol- 

 lowing joints short, subglobular, becoming more elongated and slender to- 

 wards the tip of the antennae ; verticils moderately long ; the fourth and fifth 

 basal joints of the flagellum are densely pubescent on the under side of 

 the J*. 



L. fuscovaria. Antennis basi pallidis ; thorace cinereo, fusco-variegato ; 

 pedibus pallidis ; alis fusco-variegatis ; long. lin. 2^-3. 



Head cinereous, proboscis and palpi brown ; antennae pale at base, darker 

 towards the tip, with moderate verticils. Thorax cinereous with three narrow 

 brown stripes ; the intermediate one, which is paler, ends in two black dots 

 near the collare ; pleurae with two brown stripes ; one begins at the collare : 

 the other at the fore coxae ; both running backwards ; brown spots near and 

 on the coxae ; scutellum cinereous with two, sometimes indistiuct, brown 

 spots; metathorax cinereous, its latter half brown; halteres pale, with the 

 tip slightly dusky ; feet pale, clothed with hair ; tip of the tarsi a little darker. 

 Abdomen . brown, paler at the incisures ; lateral margins darker ; tf forceps 

 pale ; tf ovipositor ferruginous, long, slender, nearly straight. Wings varie- 

 gated with numerous little round, brown dots ; five larger, nearly square spots 

 along the anterior margin ; the first a little beyond the humeral veinlet ; the 

 second at the origin of the petiole ; the third on the central cross-veins, de- 

 scending nearly to the discal areolet ; the fourth at the tip of the subcostal

Virginia, Trenton Falls, etc., (nob.) June, July. 



This species is very easy to recognize by the cross-vein which divides the 

 second radial area in two sections. 



11th Section. 



Wings without petiolated areolet, somewhat like Meig. i. tab. v. f. 4. 

 This group is purely artificial and comprises two species which have the 

 above character in common. 



L. quadrat a. Cinerea, antennis palpisque fuscis, pedibus pallide ferru- 

 gineis, femorum, tibiarum tarsorumque apicibus fuscis, alis subhyalinis ; long, 

 lin. 2-3|. 



Front and vertex greenish cinereous ; palpi and antennae brown ; basal joints 

 of the flagellum a little paler ; verticils long. Thorax cinereous ; praescutum 

 yellowish cinereous without distinct stripes ; pleurae slightly hoary ; halteres 

 pale ; feet yellowish ferruginous ; coxae and base of femora pale yellow ; tips 

 of femora, tibiae and tarsi brown. Abdomen brownish ; genitals yellow. 

 Wings slightly infuscated, pale at the root ; stigma pale ; veins brown ; sub- 

 costal and mediastinal veins pale yellow ; the mediastinal cross- vein is near 

 the tip of the mediastinal vein ; the stigmatical cross-vein is immediately be- 

 yond the origin of the radial fork ; the central cross-veins form a nearly 

 straight line. 



Ten (J* 9 specimens. Virginia, Maryland, in May and June (nob.) 



L. lent a. Pallide silacea, antennarum flagello palpisque infuscatis, fronte 

 canescente, alis hyalinis, stigmate pallide infuscato ; antennae maris dnse 

 pubescentes ; long. 2f 3^. 



Pale ochraceous yellow ; palpi and antennae (excepting the basal joints) 

 fuscous ; antennae of the ^ thickly covered with a short pubescence ; verticils 

 in both sexes short; joints oval: last joint small, club-shaped; front hoary; 

 vertex infuscated ; tip of the tarsi infuscated. The falciform appendages of 

 the (5* forceps are more diverging in this species than in the others of the 

 genus. Wings pale yellowish ; costal, mediastinal, subcostal and pobrachial 

 veins yellow ; the others brown ; stigma slightly infuscated round the cross- 

 vein, which is situated near the origin of the radial fork (a little before or a 

 little beyond it, its position differing sometimes on both wings of the same- 

 specimens) ; mediastinal cross-vein near the tip of the mediastinal vein. 



The general appearance of this species is very much like that of L. a r e o- 

 1 a t a, but it is easy to distinguish the former by the absence of the petiolated 

 areolet, the shorter discal areolet, etc. 



Compared ten $ 9 specimens. Virginia, Maryland, D. C, May, June 

 (nob.) Illinois (Mr. Kennicott.) 



11th Section. 



Wings covered with a fine pubescence on the whole surface; no petiolated 

 areolet ; neuration like Meig. vol. i. tab. v. f. 4, but second radial area nearly 

 as long as the lower one ; antenna, icith apparently 17-joints; palpi short. 



The location of this group within the present genus is only temporary ; the 

 pubescence of the wings and the number of joints of the antennae would seem 

 to justify its separation ; but having only a single specimen in my possession, 

 I have not been able to come to any definite conclusion as to its position in 

 the system.

242 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



halterum capitulo infuscatis ; alis pallide fusceseentibus, pilosis. Long 

 lin. 3. 



Proboscis and palpi fuscous ; front and vertex infuscated in the middle, 

 cinereous near the eyes ; antennae fuscous, with long verticils, and apparently 

 17-jointed. Thorax tawny, a little darker on the praescutum, pleura? paler ; 

 metathorax pale brown ; halteres pale at base ; knob infuscated ; feet tawny, 

 slightly hairy, infuscated at the tip of femora and tarsi. Tergum brown, venter 

 paler ; valves of 9 ovipositor long, narrow, sharp, and but slightly curved. 

 Wings infuscated, covered with a short, sparse, almost microscopic pubescence, 

 which is evenly spread over the whole surface ; it is not woolly, like in E r i o p- 

 t e ra and does not affect much the transparency of the wing. The stigma is 

 indistinct ; the second radial area is nearly equal in length to the cubital ; the 

 three central cross-veins form almost a straight line ) the mediastinal cross- 

 vein is near the tip of the mediastinal vein. 



A single $ specimen. Trenton Falls (nob.) 



This species has a striking resemblance with Ula pi 1 o s a : the latter, how- 

 ever, is easily distinguished by the position of the mediastinal cross-vein, which 

 is remote from the tip of the mediastinal vein ; by the hairy eyes, the longer 

 palpi, and the valves of the 9 ovipositor, which are much shorter, broader 

 and more curved. 



Trichocera Meig. 



This genus is mentioned here with the purpose only of showing its affini- 

 ties. 



It is allied to genus Limnophila nob., by the neuration of the wings 

 (two radial area, petiolate areolet, etc.,) its spurred tibiae with smooth ungues 

 and distinct pulvilli ; although the joint of the antennae are indistinct, as in 

 Limnophila. (See his remark to plate xxvi. fig. 8, in Walker's Ins. Brit. 

 Dipt. vol. iii.) 



But Trichocera differs from Limnophila nob., by the position of the 

 mediastinal cross -vein, which is at a moderate distance from the tip of the 

 mediastinal vein, although not anterior to the origin of the petiole, by the short- 

 ness and incurved direction of the axillary vein and by the length of the last 

 joint of the palpi. 



The American species in my collection appear to be identical with the Euro- 

 pean species of this genus ; I would not venture to describe them, therefore, 

 before having carefully compared them with specimens from the other conti- 

 nent. 



Anisomera Meig. , 



The characters of the only North American species in my possession agree 

 with those of this genus as defined by Meigen, Zetterstedt and Walker. The 

 wings are exactly like Meig. i. tab. vii. f. 8. I perceive but six joints in the 

 antennae of the 9 ana " not ten as Mr. Westwood does (see Walk. Dipt. Brit. iii. 

 tab. xxvi. f. 9.) 



Like Arrhenica and E r i o c e r a, this genus is allied to Limno- 

 phila nob., by its two radial areae, the spurs at the tip of the tibiae, the dis- 

 tinct pulvilli and the form of the <^ genitals. 



A. megacera. Obscure cinerea, thorace vittis tribus fuscis; antennis tf 

 corpore longioribus, nigris ; pedibus nigris, femoribus basi pallide fuscis ; alis 

 snbeinereis ; long. lin. 2f. 



Head cinereous, brownish on the front ; palpi and antennae black ; the latter, 

 in the <$, by the one-half longer than the body with a fine pubescence ; their 

 basal joints short, the tip of the third reach considerably beyond the base of 

 the wing ; the fourth, fifth, and sixth are about equal in length and a little 

 shorter than the third ; antennae of the 9 short, not reaching the base of the

wings ; the third joint is the longest ; the sixth is very short, almost rudi- 

 mental. Thorax cinereous, with a brownish, cuneiform, axillary intermediate 

 stripe, and two lateral stripes, which are abbreviated before and extended 

 over the scutum behind ; metathorax cinereous ; halteres pale at the base ; 

 knob blackish ; feet black, base of femora tawny. Abdomen blackish ; ^ 

 genitals black ; 9 ovipositor very short, brownish. Wings subcinereous, 

 veins black ; subcostal area tawny ; neuration like Meig. i. tab. vii. f. 8. 



Two (^ specimens from Washington, D. C, and one 9 from Maryland ;

Eeioceba Macq. 



Front with a tubercle behind the antennae. Antennae rather short, nearly 

 of the same length in ^ an( i 9) six (or seven) jointed ; third joint twice as 

 long as the fourth. Proboscis short ; palpi nearly as long as the head ; second 

 and third joints of about the same length ; the last joint about twice as long. 

 Eyes remote, naked. Feet long, moderately stout, tibiae with distinct spurs ; 

 tarsi with distinct pulvilli. Wings with two cubital arese and no petiolate 

 areolet (somewhat. like Meig. i. tab. v. f. 4.) Forceps of the ^ very much 

 like that of Arrhenica (see fig. 31.) Ovipositor of the $ of moderate 

 length. 



Eriocera is closely allied to Arrhenica, but is distinguished by the 

 antennas, which are short in both sexes, and by the structure of the palpi. 



Macquart founded 'this genus in 1838, on a Brazilian species. (Dipteres Ex- 

 otiques i. i. p. 74.) 



E. fuliginosa. Nigro-fusca : basi antennarum et pedibus fulvo-ferrugi- 

 neis ; apice femoram^ tibiarumque nigra ; alis nigro-fuscis ; length 4-5 lin. 



Lower part of the head and proboscis tawny ; palpi black ; antennae black; 

 basal joints yellowish ferruginous. Thorax dull brown with a slight grey re- 

 flection ; four brown more or less distinct stripes on this grey ground : halteres 

 brown ; feet ferruginous, tip of femora and tibiae brown, tarsi brown. Abdo- 

 men brown, shining ; male forceps tawny (see fig. 31) ; female ovipositor fer- 

 ruginous tawliy at the base. Wings brown, clouded along the veins ; stigma 

 darker brown. 



Nine male and one female specimens from Berkely Springs (Va.) and Wash- 

 ington, D. C. 



I possess two male specimens from Virginia, which are very different from 

 the normal ones. The whole body is cinereous ; the stripes on the thorax are 

 more distinct ; the wings are pale brownish. It is not impossible that they 

 belong to a different species. 



Arrhenica nob. 



Front with an abrupt tubercle behind the antennas. Antenna of ^ 6-jointed, 

 more than twice as long as the body, with a row of small, erect spines on the under 

 side ; those of the $ not longer than the thorax, 10-jointed, the last joint being 

 then indistinct. Proboscis much shorter than the head. Palpi longer than 

 the proboscis, sometimes longer than the head ; the second and fourth joint 

 are much longer than the third. Eyes remote, naked. Feet long, tibiae with 

 distinct spurs ; tarsi with distinct, well developed pulvilli. Neuration of the 

 wings like that of Limnophila; with two radial area? and with or without 

 petiolated areolet. Forceps of the tf somewhat similar to that of Limno- 

 phila, consisting of an elongated, subcylindrical basal piece with two falci- 

 form appendages (see fig. 30, and detailed description appended to it.) Ovi- 

 positor of the $ elongated in A. spinos a, short in A. longicornis. 



The long antennab of the <^Arrhenica remind us of the genus M e g i s t fl- 

 ee ra Wied., but these genera differ: 1st, by the antenna: of the 9 which are 

 long in the species described by Wiedemann ; according to him they are 10-

jointed ; and further he does not make any mention of the spines on the under 

 side of the joints, peculiar to the tf Arrhenica; 2d, by the wings, which, 

 according to Wiedemann, are like those of T i p u 1 a, where, as in Arrhe- 

 nica the neuration is like that of Li mn ophila, and the position of the 

 last externo-medial vein shows uninistakeably that this neuration belongs to 

 the type of the Tipuhe brevipalpes ; 3d, by the palpi, which, according to 

 Wiedemann have joints of almost equal length inMegistocera; this is not 

 the case in Arrhenica. 



Besides Wiedemann, Macquart and Westwood have described species of 

 Megistocera from different parts of the world. But there is disagreement 

 between these authors as to the characters of the genus, a disagreement which 

 makes one suspect that the species described by them might belong to different 

 genera, only having the extraordinary length of the antennae in common. 

 Thus, disagreeing with Wiedemann, Westwood (in the Ann. de la Soc. Ent. 

 de France, 1 835, p. 682, ) describes aM.dimidiata from New Holland, whose 

 $ has short antennae. The same is the case with Macquart's M. 1 i m b i p e n- 

 nis 9 (Dipt. Exotiques, Suppl. i. p. 17) ; moreover, accordiug to him, these 

 antennae are 13-jointed, and those of the r^ are described as finely pubescent on 

 the inside; the last joint of the palpi of the same species is said to be long and 

 flexible, in contradiction to Wiedemann's description of the palpi of Megis- 

 tocera. 



But these three authors seem to agree in one point, the neuration of the wings, 

 and in this point all the species described by them differ from the two spe- 

 cies of Arrhenica described below. The wings of the former species are 

 described and figured as being like those of T i p u 1 a ; the wings of the latter 

 are exactly like those of Limnophila. 



Besides Wiedemann's above quoted words, Macquart's figures of M. f us- 

 cana and limbipennis (in Dipt. Exot. Suppl. i. tab. ii. iii. iv.) show the 

 last externo-medial vein originating from the pobrachial areolet, a diftinctive cha- 

 racter of the neuration of the Tipulae longipalpes. Arrhenica does not 

 even show an approach to such a neuration. 



The name Arrhenica is given in allusion to the length of the antennae of 

 the (j% and the prevalence in this respect of this sex over the other. 



The two species described below may be easily distinguished thus : 



A petiolate areolet . . . . A.spinosa. 



No petiolate areolet . . : A. longicornis Wk. 



A. s p i n o s a. Alas areola petiolata instructor, infuscatae, stigmate oblongo, 

 obscure fusco ; thorax vittis quatuor distinctis, mediis approximatis ; long, tf 

 4J-5 ; J circa 9 lin. 



rf Head cinereous, tawny below and on the anterior side of the tubercle ; 

 labium and palpi black ; antennae more than twice as long as the body, black, 

 two basal joints tawny ; the first three joints reach a little beyond the base of 

 the wing ; the fourth is longer than the third, and each of the following joints 

 is longer than the preceding one ; the sixth is as long or longer than all the 

 others together. Thorax cinereous, clothed with a soft cinereous down ; prae- 

 scutum with four blackish stripes ; the intermediate pair approximated, 

 parallel, limited behind by the suture ; lateral stripes broader, abbreviated 

 before and extended over the scutum behind ; scutellum brownish cinereous ; 

 metathorax more or less dark brown ; pleurae with a hoary reflection on their 

 lower part ; halteres pale at the base, knob black ; coxae hoary, trochanters 

 and base of femora yellowish tawny ; femora and tibiae tawny with brown tips ; 

 tarsi brown. Abdomen greyish black ; lateral edges, especially beyond the 

 third segment, yellowish ; venter paler ; forceps tawny ; structure like fig. 30. 

 Wings infuscated ; subcostal area tawny ; stigma oblong, brown, situated be- 

 tween the mediastinal and stigmatical cross-veins and divided in two by the 

 subcostal vein ; subapical area about equal in length to the second radial ;

cubital a little longer ; petiolate areolet shorter than its petiole. 9 differs 

 from the tf by the brownish-ferruginous tinge of its body. The antennae are 

 not longer than the head and the thorax together ; they have no spines but 

 only sparse hairs ; ten indistinct joints can be counted ; ovipositor ferru- 

 ginous. 



I possess two specimens of the ^ : one caught by me near Trenton 

 Falls, N. Y., the other by Mr. Scudder in Mass. My only female specimen I 

 also brought from Trenton Falls, and do not doubt of its specific identity 

 with the males. 



A. longicornis. Cinerea, aim absque areola petiolata ; stigmate subquad- 

 rato, fusco ; thorace vittis tribus obscuris ; long. lin. 4-5. 



? Anisomera longicornis Walker, List of Diptera of the Brit. Mus. i. p. 82.. 



Head cinereous, palpi black, antennae black ; two basal joints pale ; those 

 of the rf are three or four times longer than the body ; the third joint reaches 

 beyond the base of the wing ; every following joint is longer than the prece- 

 ding ; the sixth joint as long as the fourth and fifth together ; the spines 

 on the lower surface of the antennae become short and indistinct towards its 

 end ; besides the spines there is a microscopic pubescence on the same side of 

 the antennae ; antennae of the 9 hardly reaching beyond the origin of the 

 wing ; no spines, but hairs ; two basal joints and base of the third yellowish ; 

 third joint as long as the two first, taken together ; the fourth more than 

 twice shorter than the third ; the fifth a little longer than the fourth ; the 

 following three joints are of about the same length ; the ninth is a little longer 

 and the tenth a little shorter than the preceding ones. Thorax cinereous ; a 

 long straight pubescence on the sides in the ^ ; no such pubescence in the 

 9 ; three blackish stripes on the praescutum ; intermediate stripe cuneiform, 

 with a distinct brown line in the middle ; the lateral ones abbreviated before 

 and extended over the scutum behind ; the lower portion of the pleurae hoary ; 

 scutellum and metathorax grey ; halteres pale ; feet black ; coxae cinereous, 

 trochanters and femora tawny, except the tip of the latter, which is brown. 

 Abdomen greyish black ; genitals of the same color ; ovipositor of the 9 Very 

 short, (not longer than the segments of the abdomen). Wings whitish- 

 cinereous, with brown veins ; no petiolate areolet ; subapical area longer than 

 the second radial ; cubital a little longer than both ; stigma situated between 

 the mediastinal and stigmatical cross-veins, and not much longer than 

 broad. 



Mr. Walker's description agrees quite well with my specimens, only he 

 does not mention the spines on the antennae, nor the presence of the discal 

 areolet.; the latter characters especially he ought to have mentioned, as the 

 genus Anisomera, in which he locates this species, has no discal areolet in 

 its typical form. The correctness of my identification is not therefore quite 

 certain. 



I have two $ specimens ; from Maine, (Mr. Packard) ; from Trenton Falls 

 (nob.), and one 9 from Illinois, (Mr. Kennicott.) 



Amalopis Halid. 



Front ivith a tubercle behind the antenna. Palpi nearly as long, or longer, than the 

 head ; last joint much longer than the preceding. Eges hairy. Mediastinal cross-vein 

 far removed fom the tip of the mediastinal vein, and anterior to the origin of the pe- 

 tiole. Discal areolet (when extant) pentagonal, the second lower discal cross- vein being 

 very oblique: Wings divaricate in repose. The tf genitals are totally different 

 in their structure, both from Limnobia and Limnophila, and seem to 

 approach those of T i p u 1 a ; the forceps consist of a coriaceous substance, with 

 a heltnet-shnped lobe and several horny branches on the inside, (fig. 32, forceps 

 of A. inconstans.) On account of this hard substance, these organs pre- 

 serve pretty well in dry specimens.

246 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



Such are the characters which separate from Limnophila nob., and in 

 general from the whole tribe of the T i p u 1 a r i ae with short palpi, a distinct 

 natural group, consisting of the three species described below, under the tempo- 

 rary generic denomination of Analopis Halid. and of P e d i c i a 

 Latr. This group has the following characters in common with Limnophila 

 nob. 



Two radial area ; tibia armed ivith spurs at the tip ; pulvilli distinct ; an'enna 16- 

 jointed, (17-jointed in A. inconstans nob ) 



The neuration of the wings is pretty much like that of P e d i c i a , (see Meig. 

 i. tab. iv. f. 14) ; but is very inconstant. It varies not only in the different 

 species of the group, but in different specimens of the same species, nay on both 

 wings of the same specimen. 



In A. c a 1 c a r , as well as in P e d i c i a , it is the cubital vein which forks, 

 instead of the radial. In A. i n c o n s t a n s it is sometimes the radial, some- 

 times the cubital vein which forks ; the passage from one to the other form is 

 very gradual, and shows the secondary value of this character in the present 

 genus. 



The discal areolet is wanting in A. occulta; it is generally present, but 

 sometimes wanting in A. inconstans; it is extant in the only specimen of 

 A. auripennis which I possess; finally in both of my specimens of A. 

 C a 1 c a r it is wanting on one wing and extant on the other. 



A constant and for this reason important character is the location of the 

 mediastinal cross-vein anterior to the origin of the petiole. 



Mr. Haliday was the first, I believe, who noticed (in Walker's Dipt. Brit, 

 iii. p. xv., Addenda,) that L. occulta Meig. had hairy eyes and a frontal 

 tubercle. On these two characters, and on the absence of the discal areolet he es- 

 tablished (1. c.) the genus A m a 1 o p i s . Although I do not know A. occulta 

 Meig., I have no doubt, from its description and the figures of its wing in the 

 authors, that it belongs to the same group with the three species described be- 

 low, although the location of these species in the same genus may be only tem- 

 porary. (I am certain, for instance, that A. inconstans with its 17-jointed 

 antennae will be formed into a new genus.) I prefer to retain in the mean 

 time for all the species of this group the name given by Mr. Haliday to one 

 of them. 



P ed i c i a undoubtedly belongs to the same group. It possesses all the above 

 mentioned generic characters, excepting, perhaps, the pubescent eyes. Although 

 Mr. Walker (Dipt. Brit. iii. p. 314,) asserts that the eyes are minutely pubescent, 

 I could not discover any traces of this pubescence in my specimens ; it may 

 have been rubbed off. 



The natural group, consisting of the genera Amalopis and Pedicia, 

 seems to hold an intermediate position between the T i p u 1 ar i as with short 

 and those with long palpi, (that is between L i m n o b i a Meig. and T i p u 1 a 

 Meig.) Although closely allied to the former, they approach T i p u 1 a by their 

 divaricated wings, their elongated palpi, the form of the discal areolet and the struc- 

 ture of the $ forceps. The genus Tricyphona Zett., unknown to me, 

 belongs, perhaps, to the same group. However, Zetterstedt describes the tibiae 

 as unarmed, and this would be an important difference. The genus Evani- 

 optera, established by Guerin, on a speeies from Brazil, (Voyage de la 

 Coquille, 1830,) seems also to belong hither. Limnobia littoralis Meig., 

 judging from the neuration of its wing, might be closely allied to my A. in- 

 constans. Limnobia u n i c o 1 o r Schum., ought, perhaps, to be located here 

 too. 



The habits of Amalopis are unknown, but they seem to be aquatic. The 

 larva of Pedicia rivosa has been found by Scheffer (see Rossi, Dipt. Aus- 

 triaca,) in spring-water.

 matical cross-vein at the tip of subcostal vein; the first lower discal cross-vein 

 is situated at about the middle of the distance, between the origin of the two 

 forks, which it unites ; stigma pale.

 base, two la3t joints brown ; antennae yellowish ferruginous, infuscated at tip, 

 reaching about half the distance between the head and the base of the wing ; 

 second joint obconical ; the following joints subcylindrical, moderately verti-

 and extant on the other; what the normal neuration is, I am unable therefore 

 to state. On those wings where it is wanting, (which happens to be the left 

 wing in the tf specimen and the right in the 9 >) the neuration looks pretty 

 much like Meig. i. tab. v. f. 8. The cross-vein closing the areolet on the other 

 wing is in the middle of the distance, between the origins of the second and 

 third fork. 



A. inconstans. Ochracea, thoracis dorso ferrugineo, alarum margine 

 anteriore et venis transversis infuscatis ; long lin. 4^ 5 \. 



Coloring very inconstant; ochraceous, more or less mixed with brown on 

 the thorax and the abdomen, sometimes altogether without brown. The fol- 

 lowing is the description of the specimens with fully developed dark coloring : 



Proboscis and palpi fuscous ; front cinereous, brownish towards the vertex; 

 hind part of vertex and under side of the head yellowish ; antennae 17-jointed, 

 pale, but little longer than the head ; basal joint sometimes dusky; flagellum 

 with moderate verticils. Collare ochraceous ; a black ring near the head ; 

 a brown stripe along the middle ; praescutum ferruginous, with a slight brown 

 tinge along the middle; stripes indistinct; scutum infuscated on both sides; a 

 brown mark in the shape of a V in the middle of the suture ; scutellum and 

 metathorax yellow, fuscous on both sides ; pleuras pale ; halteres pale ; feet

yellow, femora and tibiae faintly infuscated at the tip ; tarsi tawny, fuscous 

 at tip, spurs short. Tergum yellow ; posterior margins of segments fuscous; 

 first and second segments infuscated, the following with a fuscous stripe along 

 the middle; the two last segments fuscous; genitals of the $ fuscous; of the 

 9 ferruginous. Wings subcinereous ; subcostal and mediastinal areae brown ; 

 this color occupies the whole base of the wing and encroaches also on theprae- 

 brachial and both radial areae ; mediastinal, stigmatical and central cross-veins 

 and origin of petiole clouded with brown. 



This is the normal coloring; but among the eighteen specimens which 

 I have before me only four show it in its full development. All the others 

 are more or less pale about the collare, scutum, scutellum, metathorax 

 and abdomen, sometimes with a slight indication of brown, sometimes with- 

 out any. 



The coloring of the wings is also variable, the fuscous tinge of the anterior 

 margin and the clouds on the cross-veins being sometimes very pale. The 

 cinereous tinge of the front, the brown ring on the collare, near the head, the ferrugi- 

 nous, almost orange, color of the prcescutum and the infuscated anterior margin of the 

 wing may be considered as characteristic. 



The neuration of the wings is likewise inconstant. The normal ueuration is 

 exactly like Meig. i. tab. vi. f. 4, only the first lower discal cross-vein is a little 

 nearer to the apex of the wing, (originating from the lower branch of the fork.) 

 Among my eighteen specimens, ten (eight ^ and two 9) partake of this 

 neuration. 



In three specimens, the first lower discal cross-vein is removed nearer towards 

 the base of the wing, so that the first externomedial areolel is petiolate. In one of 

 the specimens this is the case with one wing only, the same areolet on the other 

 being sessile. 



In three other specimens the discal areolet is wanting, (that is, open from 

 want of a second lower discal cross-vein.) 



In two specimens it is the cubital vein which forms the fork, and not the 

 radial, the latter originating before the fork. But in both instances the position 

 of this vein on one wing does not agree exactly with that on the other. In one 

 case the radial vein issues from the same joint with the fork. 



The great cross-vein varies in its position also. Sometimes it is opposite, 

 sometimes below the upper discal cross-vein. 



In one specimen there are three supplementary cross-veins in the cubital 

 area. 



One character which seems to be merely accidental in other species, is very 

 constant in this : it is the presence of a stump of a vein near the origin of the petiole. 

 This stump is long and distinct, and is wanting only on one wing of one of my 

 eighteen specimens. 



Fifteen $ and three 9 specimens. Washington, common early in April and 

 later; New York and Virginia Springs (nob.); Connecticut, (Mr. Norton.) 



This species seems to be allied to the European Limnobia littoralis 

 Meig. 



Pkdicia Latr. 



The characters of this genus have been mentioned in part in detailing those 

 of Amalopis. For more detaiis see Walker, Ins. Brit. Dipt. iii. p. 314. I 

 would add only to Mr. Walker's characteristics of this genus, that all the 

 tibias have two spurs at the tip and not the hind tibia; alone.

spots along the tergum ; they are dark brown in the middle and ferruginous on 

 the margins. Wiags with a brown stripe along the costa ; another one along 

 the pobrachial vein; a brown band unites both across the central cross-veins; 

 the rest of the wing is hyaline. 



Length from 13 to 15 lines. 



I possess specimens from Trenton Falls, (nob.), Massachusetts (Mr. Scudder), 

 and Connecticut, (Mr. Norton.) 



Dicranota Zett. 



Antennae 13-jointed.(*) Eyes hairy. Wings with two area?. Tibiae with 

 small, but distinct spurs at the tip. Pulvilli distinct. Mediastinal cross-vein 

 far remote from the tip of mediastinal vein, anterior to the origin of the 

 petiole, and situated about the middle of the anterior margin. Structure of 

 the (^ genitals analogous to that of Amalopis and Pedicia. Head 

 small ; proboscis and palpi very short ; a distinct gibbosity on the head be- 

 hind the antennae ; feet of moderate size and thickness. 



The wing of my D. rivularis is exactly like Mr. West wood's figure of 

 that of D. pavida in Walker's Ins. ,Brit. Dipt. iii. tab. xxx. f. 7, having 

 no discal areolet, two cross-veins between the upper branch of the radial vein 

 and the subcostal, and one fork behind the subapical areolet. The' neuration 

 varies in different species of the genus, but the position of the mediastinal cross- 

 vein seems to be an essential character. 



This genus was first established by Prof. Zetterstedt on his D. G-uerinii; 

 afterwards, Mr. Haliday, in Walker's Ins. Brit. Dipt. iii. p. 306, added to it 

 D. pavida Hal., D. bimaculata Schum., and D. senilis Hal. How- 

 ever, D. bi maculata Schum. is mentioned in Prof. Zetterstedt's work (Dipt. 

 Scand. torn. x. p. 3897, No. 72,) among the Limnobiae. How should have 

 Zetterstedt misplaced a species belonging to a genus established by himself, 

 unless he overlooked its having 13, and not 16, joints of the antennae ? 



D. senilis Hal., as figured in Ins. Brit. Dipt. iii. tab. xxvii. f. 3, is quite 

 distinct from the other speoies by the presence of a discal areolet, by its hav- 

 ing one cross-vein, instead of two, between the subcosta and the upper branch 

 of the radial fork ; and above all, by the position of the mediastinal cross- 

 vein,- which is posterior to the origin of the petiole, and not far distant from 

 the tip of the mediastinal vein. If the latter character is correctly figured on 

 the plate, I would doubt whether this species belongs to Dicranota. 



The affinities of this genus with A malopis and Pedicia (hairy eyes, 

 position of the mediastinal cross-vein structure of the $ genitals, etc.,) are 

 manifest; it is distinguished by the short palpi, the number'of the joints of 

 the antennae, etc. 



The only species described below, agrees in its characters with D. Gu eri- 

 n i i Zett. on which, as mentioned above, the genus was first established. 

 Only Prof. Zetterstedt does not make any mention of the hairy eyes, which he 

 may have overlooked. (See also the remark about the antennae, at the end 

 of the description.) 



D. rivularis. Cinerea, thorace vittis tribus fuscis, femorum basi pallida, 

 alis subcihereis ; long. lin. 3-4. 



Head cinereous, front and vertex slightly infuscated ; proboscis, palpi and 

 antennae black ; the latter in both tf and > short, not reaching the base of 

 the wings, joints of the fiagellum subglobular, (see the observation at the end 

 of the description). Thorax cinereous with three distinct, blackish stripes, 

 the intermediate one broad, and, in some specimens, distinctly capillary ; 

 lateral one abbreviated before, extended over the scutum behind ; scutellum 

 and metathorax cinereous, posterior half of the latter blackish ; halteres 



(*) As to the length of the antennae, see observation at the end.

250 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP , 



pale, very slightly dusky on the knob ; coxae cinereous, trochanters and base 

 of femora pale ; feet black. Abdomen blackish cinereous, indistinctly whitish 

 along the lateral margins ; male genitals cinereous ; female ovipositor ferrugi- 

 nous. Wings tinged with cinereous ; stigma pale, indistinct, situated be- 

 tween the stigmatical and supplementary cross-vein ; neuration like tab. xxx. 

 f. 7, of Walker's Ins. Brit. Dipt. vol. iii., only the petiole of the lower fork is 

 shorter than the fork itself, and the pubescence of the veins is not so apparent 

 as in the figure. 



Seven tf and two 9 specimens, taken near Washington, early in April. 

 They were flying along the surface of a little stream in the woods and copu- 

 lating. 



One of the ^ specimens has a discal areolet on both wings ; it is formed by 

 a cross-vein which connects the lowest fork, near its origin, with the next ex- 

 terno-medial vein. 



Some of the specimens have a stump of a vein near the origin of the 

 petiole. 



Observation. Both $ and $ of D. rivularis have been described above 

 as having short antennae. At least I found such specimens in copulation. But 

 besides the males with short antennae, I found, on the same day and in the 

 same locality, two males, having antennae twice as long as head and thorax 

 together, with 13 nearly cylindrical, elongated, densely pubescent joints ; the 

 joints of the flagellum are of nearly equal length, except the last one, which 

 is shorter. The other characters of the body and the wings of these specimens 

 agree- entirely with Dicranota rivularis, except that the vertex, the knob 

 of the halteres and the stigma are more distinctly infuscated. The specimens 

 are probably the normal representatives of the male, the more so as D. G u e r i- 

 n i i Zett., has also long antennae. What the males with short antennae, which 

 I found in copulation, are, further investigation will show. 



Ula Halid. 



Antennae 17-jointed. (*) Wings with two radial areae, finely pilose on their 

 whole surface. Mediastinal cross-vein far removed from the tip of the mediastinal 

 vein and anterior to the origin of the petiole. Spurs at the tip of the tibiae very 

 short, but distinct. Pulvilli distinct. Ungues smooth. Proboscis elongated, 

 although shorter than the head. Palpi elongated, especially the last joints. Eyes 

 pubescent. 



The characters of this genus, as given by Walker (Ins. Brit. Dipt. iii. 307), 

 agree too well with the specimen in my collection, to admit of any doubt as 

 to the generic identity. The pubescence of the eyes alone is not mentioned, but 

 may have been overlooked. The neuration of the wing of my specimen agrees 

 exactly with Mr. Westwood's figure of the wing of U 1 a in the above quoted 

 work, (1. c. tab. xxvii. fig. 4). With the precision peculiar to him, Mr. West- 

 wood has not even overlooked the position of the mediastinal cross- vein. 

 Schummel's tab. ii. fig. 7, conveys also an idea of the neuration of this 

 genus. 



Ula shows some relation to P e d i c i a in the position of the mediastinal 

 cross-vein, the pubescence of the eyes and the length of the palpi ; but it 

 differs in the length of the antennae, the pilose wings and the position of the 

 last externo-medial vein. The direction of the latter is like that in the majority 

 of the Limnobiae, and not oblique, as in Amalopis and Pedicia. 



The larvae of U 1 a have been found by Dr. Stannius in Agaricus, (Schumm. 

 Limnob. p. 25.) 



The only species I possess seems to be identical with the European Ula 

 pilosa, judging, at least, from its descriptions ; I redescribe it, therefore, 

 under the same name. 



(*)I copy this character from Walker, the tip of the antennte of my single specimen 

 being broken.

Long. lin. 3. 



Front and vertex light cinereous ; proboscis infuscated, palpi and antennae 

 black ; two basal joints of the latter short, yellowish ; the following joints 

 elongated, subcylindrical, verticillated and covered, besides with a short 

 pubescence. Thorax yellowish cinereous, paler on the pleurae, a brownish 

 stripe in the middle of the praescutum ; lateral stripes almost obsolete ; scutum 

 infuscated ; scutellum pale ; halteres pale ; the knob infuscated at the tip ; 

 feet tawny, infuscated at the tips of femora, tibiae and tarsi ; coxae and basis of 

 femora pale. Abdomen brownish, venter paler, 9 ovipositor falciform, short, 

 ferruginous Wings brownish cinereous, finely, densely and uniformly pilose 

 over the whole surface ; veins brown ; this pubescence is not woolly as in 

 Erioptera, and affects but little the transparency of the wing ; stigma ellipti- 

 cal, but little darker in color than the wing itself; a slight brown nebula on the 

 central cross- vein ; no petiolate areolet ; stigmatical cross-vein near the tip 

 of the subcostal vein, and a little beyond the middle of the upper branch 

 of the radial fork. (Compare also the above quoted figures of Westwood 

 and Schummel.) 



A single 9 specimen from Washington (nob.) 



At first glance, this species has a striking resemblance to Limnophila 

 pilosa nob., especially on account of the pubescence of the wings. It is 

 easily distinguished, however, by the position of the mediastinal cross -vein, 

 the structure of the antennae and that of the 2 ovipositor, which is larger in 

 Limnophila pilosa, etc. 



Protoplasa nob. 



Proboscis sfout, ending in a thick labium ; both together are as long, or a little 

 longer than the head. Palpi longer than the head, joints elongated. Antennae 

 15-jointed, shorter than head and proboscis together, setaceous, verticillated ; 

 first joint short, cylindrical ; 2d, stout, subglobular ; the following joints 

 cylindrical, compressed, short ; the five last joints more oval, elongated. Front 

 broad. Thorax gibbose ; suture deeply sinuated; scutellum large, projecting 

 over the metathorax, which is short. Abdemen rather short, stout. Feet 

 moderately long, slender; tibiae armed at the tip with moderately long, 

 strong, divaricated spurs ; pulvilli indistinct ; ungues smooth. Wings broad ; 

 anal angle square ; the narrow portion long and nearly linear ; neuration 

 very like that of the genus Macrochile Loew, (see Linnasa Entomologica, 

 vol. v. tab. ii. fig. 25); the only differences are, 1st, that Protoplasa 

 has a cross-vein between the discal areolet and the next longitudinal vein 

 (towards the posterior margin,) which cross-vein closes a second, smallei' 

 discal areolet. 2d, it has a stump of a vein at the angle, formed by the 

 petiole, near its origin. 



This remarkable genus is closely allied to the fossil genus Macrochile 

 Loew (1. c. p. 402) found in the Prussian amber, but with the following differ- 

 ences : 1st, Macrochile has a much longer proboscis ; 2d, its antennae are 

 19-jointed, and more than twice as long as head and proboscis together ; 3d, 

 the anal angle of its wing (judging from the above mentioned figure) is rounded 

 and not square; 4th, the neuration of the wing is somewhat different, (see above.) 



The relation of Protoplasa with Ptychoptera and Bittacomorpha 

 is evident : the struoture of the mouth, that of the antennae and feet, the deep 

 sinuosity of the thoraoic suture, as well as many analogies in the neuration of 

 the wings, indicate it sufficiently. But Protoplasa seems different from 

 both by the small size of the metathorax. (*) 



(*) I am not able to make this statement positively, as the meso- and metathoracic re- 

 gion of both my specimens was injured by the pin.

P. Fitchii. Cinerascens, pedibus pallidis, alae maculis ocellaribus brun- 

 neis, in fascias confluentibus, ornate ; long. lin. 3-3^. 



Head cinereous, proboscis and palpi fuscous, antennae infuscated. Thorax 

 cinereous, with three faint brown lines on the praescutum ; scutellum pale, 

 infuscated in the middle ; halteres pale, knobs brown ; feet yellowish ; knees, 

 tips of tibiae, of the first" joint of tarsi and of their last joints brown. Abdomen 

 brown; posterior margins of segments paler. Wings whitish, with brown 

 spots and bands : most of the spots have the form of a ring, with an infus- 

 cated vein in the centre ; they are distributed in three groups : 1st, basal 

 group, formed of an ocellus near the origin of petiole, a spot in the subcostal 

 area and two rings at the basis of the wing, near the basal angle ; 2d, central 

 band, formed of four ocelli and a large brown spot near the posterior margin ; 

 3d, apical band, formed of two large ocelli (at the tip of the discal areolet and 

 at the origin of the radial fork) ; 6 or 7 smaller ocelli along the apical margin 

 of the wing and a brown band, beginning between the two large ocelli, and 

 running along one of the longitudinal veins towards the tip of the wing. 



I am in doubt as to the sex of the two specimens of this insect, for which I 

 am indebted to Dr. Asa Fitch. 



BlTTACOMORPHA WestW. 



I take occasion to give the figure of the male genital organs of B. c 1 a vi p e s 

 Fab. (fig. 33, from above ; fig. 33a from below.) One pair of appendages (the 

 outer ones), are coriaceous ; the shorter, inner pair seems to be of a harder 

 consistence. 



This species seems to have a wide distribution over the North American con- 

 tinent. The British Museum has received it from Nova Scotia, (see Walker's 

 List of Dipt. Brit. Mus. i. p. 81). I found it in Florida, and possess, besides, 

 specimens from Upper Wisconsin River. It occurs early in the spring, and 

 also in autumn, in woods, in the neighborhood of running water. 



Ptychoptera Fabr. 



For the characters of this genus I refer to Meigen, Zetterstedt and Walker, 

 and will only mention, as a character which is peculiar to Ptychoptera, 

 Bittacomorpha and Protoplasa, and which seems to have been over- 

 looked, that the transverse thoracic suture is deeply sinuated, so that the scutum is 

 attenuated in the middle, its two lobes being connected by a narrow band only. 

 The only American species I possess is very like the European species of 

 this genus in general appearance, without seeming to be identical with any.

On the male genital organs of the T i p u 1 i d as with short palpi, together with the 

 explanation of Plates III. and IV. 



Tbe form of the external male genital organs of the Tipulidas with short 

 palpi is that of a forceps ; they are not different in this respect from the ma- 

 jority of the insects of the other orders. This forceps serves to seize the tip 

 of the abdomen of the female. In the cases of copulation which I have ob- 

 served in the genera Limnobia and Erioptera, the abdomen of the J 

 was seized/rom below, a little before the ovipositor, so that this organ was stretched 

 on the tergum of the <$. But, besides the external forceps, there is, between 

 its two halves, a second internal forceps-like apparatus. After having secured the 

 female in the described manner, the male, with this second apparatus, seizes 

 the orifice of the inner genital organs of the female and adjusts thereon for 

 copulation. This second forceps seems to vary in structure in different species.

1 have been able to see it distinctly in Arrhenica s p i n o s a : it is figured and 

 described below. 



My chief attention has been directed to the structure of the external forceps 

 for the purpose of classification; everything remains to be done, as yet, in the 

 study of the more complicated and delicate internal organs. In the descrip- 

 tion of the figures which follows, I simply relate what I have seen, without 

 attempting any generalization. 



Fig. 1, forceps of L. d e f u n c t a from below. 



Fig. 2, the same, from above ; aa, soft, fleshy lobes ; 66, horny, falciform ap- 

 pendages, moveable with the lobes, and closely applied although not attached to 

 them ; they are fastened only by the base ; cc, horny, projecting points of the 

 internal organs. 



Fig. 3, forceps of Dicranomyia humidicola from above ; aa and bb as in 

 fig. 2 ; dd, horny, square appendages, bearing each a pair of bristles ; e, point 

 of the anal style, visible between the two lobes. 



Fig. 4, forceps of Dicranomyia 1 i b e r t a from above ; aa and bb, like in fig. 



2 ; dd, horny, rostriform appendages, with bristles ; e, anal style. 



Fig. 4a, anal style of D. 1 i b e r t a, seen from below. 



Fig. 5, one-half of the forceps of Dicranomyia gladiator from above; a 

 and b, as in fig. 2 ; e, anal style. 



Fig. 6, forceps of Limnobia solitaria from above, half closed; aa, move- 

 able, coriaceous halves, with appendages (66) ; these appendages consist of two 

 lamels, which are closely applied to each other and never divergent; the out- 

 side lamel is horny ; the inside one seems to be coriaceous ; e, is the anal style , 

 cc, projecting internal organs ; ff, are soft eminences, (perhaps rudiments of the 

 large soft lobes of Dicranomyia?) 



Fig. 7, represents the forceps of Limnobia indigena from above; the 

 lamels bb are also double; in some species, as inL. tristigma, I could not 

 distinguish whether the lamels were double. 



Fig. 8, forceps of Rhipidia domestica from above, and open; aa, 66, cc, 

 dd and e, as in the preceding figures. 



Fig. 9, the same forceps, from below and closed ; e, anal style. 



Fig. 10, forceps of Teucholabis complexa from above; 10a, one-half of 

 the same, from below ; aa and bb, horny appendages. 



Fig. 11, forceps of Antocha saxicola from above; aa, double appendages, 

 consisting of a horny and a soft point, closely joined. 



Fig. 12, half of the forceps of Elephantomyia canadensis from below 

 aa, horny appendages. 



Fig. 12a, forceps of Dicranoptycha ni gripes from above; y, are short 

 black bristles ; xx, indistinct, horny appendages. In this species I had for the 

 first time a glimpse of the structure of the slender, horny, hook-shaped organ, 

 figured farther below (fig. 276), but occurring in most species. When D. 

 ni gripes opens the forceps this hook comes into a sort of erection and 

 spreads outside of the forceps in the shape of fig. 12, 6; aa, are slender and 

 horny ; 66, is a small forceps, moving independently of aa } and opening or 

 closing at the point c. 



Fig. 13, one-half of the forceps of D. s o b r i n a. 



Fig. 14, forceps of Cryptolabis paradoxa from above ; 14 a, the same from 

 below ; aa, are horny appendages ; they are small and indistinct, being closely 

 applied to the fleshy part of the forceps ; 6, seems to be the rudiment of an 

 anal style. 



Fig. 15, tip of the abdomen of Cryptolabis paradoxa, female, from the 

 side ; fig. 15a, the same, from above ; there are no visible horny lamels ; tb* 

 tips, aa, are beset with microscopic bristles.

Fig. 20, forceps of Erioptera arm ata from above. 



Fig. 21, the same, from the side. Its structure is somewhat complicated ; 

 besides the coriaceous parts dd, there are two pairs of horny appendages at- 

 tached to them ; they are invisible from above, except the tip of one of them, 

 which projects at/. One of these appendages is seen at h in fig. 21 ; detached, 

 it looks somewhat like fig. 21a, in which the portion 666 is closely applied to 

 the inside of the lobe d, and the portion c branches off. The other pair of ap- 

 pendages (ee ou fig. 21) is slender and curved ; each of them is attached to one 

 of the lobes dd. 



Fig. 22, forceps of Erioptera caloptera Say, from below. 



Fig. 23, forceps of Erioptera v e n u s t a from above. 



Fig. 23a, the same from below ; the horny appendages aa, seen from below, 

 appear double, consisting of the horny part 66, and a membranaceous appendage 

 cc ; fig. 236 represents it detached ; its margin d is horny, the rest is a thin 

 membrane ; these two appendages are not closely applied to each other, and 

 have an interval between them, although they move simultaneously. 



Fig. 24, forceps of Limnophila luteipennis, from above aa, two pairs of 

 moveable falciform appendages ; the outside ones are horny, the inside one 

 seems to be of a softer consistence and are ciliated. 



Fig. 25, forceps of Limnophila aprilina from above; structure almost 

 like the preceding ; the outside appendages have a longitudinal notch, (fig. 

 256.) 



Fig. 26, forceps of Limnophila ultima from below; outside, horny ap- 

 pendages are slightly hooked at the tip. 



Fig. 27, forceps of Limnophila rufibasis from above, open; the append- 

 ages aa are large and strong, serrated inside ; bb are also horny, and look like 

 fig. 27a; the point c is directed upwards; 276 is a slender, horny organ, situated 

 inside of the forceps, and concealed when it is closed ; its structure is perhapa 

 analogous to a similar organ inDicanoptycha (fig. 12a) ; the same organ 

 is more or less distinctly seen in almost all other species. 



Fig. 28, forceps of Limnophila montana from above, closed; it is dis- 

 tinguished at once by the position of the appendages, which is peculiar to this 

 species ; aa are the tips of internal horny organs ; they protrude, together with 

 the soft part/, when the forceps are opened. 



Fig. 28a, the same from the side ; a is the same as in fig. 28. 



Fig. 29, forceps of Symplecta punctipennis from above ; a and b are 

 horny.

 pendage ; cc internal forceps, (fig. 30a represents it detached) ; at a* is a joint, 

 by means of which this forceps is opened or closed. 



Fig. 31, forceps of Eriocera fuliginosa from above; aa are horny; 66 

 soft ; c is curved downwards, like fig. 276. 



Fig. 32, forceps of Amalopis inconstans, from above and half open. It i3 

 difficult to convey an idea of this organ by a drawing, the points/, g and h 

 being all curved and directed upwards ; aa are horny ; 66 soft ; cc coriaceous, 

 hollow inside ; h is figured separately, (326) ; the point/is bifid, (32a). 



Fig. 33, forceps of Bittacomorpha cl a v i p e s from below. 



Fig. 33a, the same, from above. 



Fig. 34. forceps of Cladura flavoferruginea, from the side ; a is convex 

 and seems to be hollow inside ; the concavity can be seen at 6 ; cc is the for- 

 ceps. This figure is a very rough sketch, drawn from a dry specimen and 

 may not, for this reason, be quite accurate.

A paper was presented for publication in the Proceedings entitled 

 u Catalogue of the Invertebrate Fossils of the Cretaceous Formation of 

 the United States, by Win. M. Gabb," and was referred to a Com- 

 mittee. 



Mr. Lesley read the following extracts from a letter he had received 

 from Mr. Edward A. Spring, Eagleswood, N. J., July 26th, 1859 : 



I was over on the South Amboy shore with a friend, walking in a swampy 

 wood, where a dyke was made, some three feet wide, when we discovered in 

 the middle of this ditch a large black spider making very queer motions for a 

 spider, and on examination it proved that he had caught a fish. 



He was biting the fish, just on the forward side of the dorsal fin with a 

 deadly gripe, and the poor fish was swimming round and round slowly, or 

 twisting its body as if in pain. The head of its black enemy was sometimes 

 almost pulled under water, but never entirely, for the fish did not seem to 

 have enough strength, but moved its fins as if exhausted, and often rested. 

 At last it swam under a floating leaf at the shore, and appeared to be trying, 

 by going under that, to scrape off the spider, but without effect. They then 

 got close to the bank, when suddenly the long black legs of the spider came 

 up out of the water where they had possibly been embracing the fish, (I have 

 seen spiders seize flies with all their legs at once) reached out behind and 

 fastened upon the irregularities of the side of the ditch. The spider then 

 commenced tugging to get his prize up the bank. My friend stayed to watch 

 them while I went to the nearest house for a wide mouthed bottle. During 

 the six or eight minutes that I was away, the spider had drawn the fish en- 

 tirely out of the water, when they had both fallen in again, the bank being 

 nearly perpendicular. There had been a great struggle and now on my re- 

 turn, the fish was already hoisted head first more than half his length out on 

 the land. The fish was very much exhausted, hardly making any movement, 

 and the spider had evidently gained the victory, and was slowly and steadily 

 tugging him up. He had not once quitted his hold during the quarter to half 

 an hour that we had watched them. He held, with his head toward the fish's 

 tail, and pulled him up at an angle of 45 by stepping backwards. How long 

 they had been there or how far they had come we cannot tell. We saw no 

 web anywhere about. 



The time would not permit a longer stay, so we reluctantly bottled the pair. 

 I thought I had missed dipping up the spider, and looked along the bank, but 

 on turning to the bottle he was there. The fish was swimming weakly at the 

 bottom of the water that I had dipped in, and the spider standing sentinel 

 over him on the surface, turning when he turned, and watching every motion. 

 We stopped the mouth of the bottle so that the spider could not escape, and 

 went to see the fine place of the late Mr. Stevens above on the hill. Return- 

 ing in about three hours, we found, to our disappointment, the spider dead at 

 the bottom, but the fish was alive. He lived for twenty-four hours. The 

 spider was f of an inch long, and weighed 14 grains ; the fish was 3^ inches 

 long and weighed 66 grains.

TlNEINA. 



It is the intention of the writer to confine these contributions to Lepidopter- 

 ology, to the description of species which are new to entoimlogical history, or 

 which are believed to be new. This plan dispenses with the necessity of general 

 remarks on systematic arrangement, since but few species at a time will be 

 .given as the genera to which they belong are determined, or ascertained to 

 be undescribed. Indeed I have nothing of value to add to what has been re- 

 cently advaaced elsewhere, nor has any question arisen iu my studies of the 

 present group, that would induce me to retract or doubt the accuracy of the 

 views advocated, respecting the nature of a farhily. I do not wish, however, 

 to be understood to assert that the group Tineina is synonymous with a family. 

 I do not by any means entertain the belief that it includes only one, and yet I 

 can perceive but little in the majority of the groups collected under this term, 

 other than artificial assemblages of genera, under a family termination. 



I find in the pterogostic characters of the perfect insect a similitude of struc- 

 ture which enables the investigator, with but little difficulty, to refer it to the 

 appropriate principal group formed on this basis. The individuals, thus assem- 

 bled together agree not only in general structure, but in embryonic histories and 

 in larval forms, so far as my own observation and study of other fauna than 

 our own has enabled me to determine the question. The agreement in embry- 

 onic form extends into the group Tortricina, and the relationship in the imago, 

 is likewise expressed to a certain degree in the neuration of the wings of this 

 latter group, as compared with that of the Tineina. The3e characters, however, 

 . are suificiently marked in each, and can scarcely be mistaken in either instance 



[Sept.

by one of ordinary powers of discrimination. Without, therefore, attempting to 

 fix at present the limits and characters of the group, more definitely than by the 

 wing structure, and rejecting the generic valves usually assigned to it, except 

 where there is characteristic variation, we will proceed to describe generic 

 groups and their individuals. 



TlNEIDjG. 



Imago with the nervules of the anterior wings radiating chiefly from the 

 posterior part of the disc, with four to five subcosto-marginal nervules, the first of 

 which arises near the base of the wing, with two simple disco-central nervules, 

 with the median nervure branching near its posterior extremity into three ner- 

 vules, medio - superior , central and posterior, with the submedian fold well marked, 

 and the submedian nervure simple and usually bifid toward the base. Posterior 

 wings with bristle, with costal nervure simple, with subcostal usually simple, 

 and attenuated toward the base of the wing, emitting a discal nervure from which 

 arise at least two disco-central nervules, with median either bifid or trifid, -with 

 submedian fold and simple submedian nervure, and an internal fold or nervure. 



Tinea Fabr. 



Head free, as broad as the thorax, roughly haired above and in front. Ocelli 

 none.- Eyes hemispherical and salient. Antennae simple, filiform, in the $ 

 very slightly ciliated, tapering from the base, with joints closely set and stri- 

 ated, not so long as the anterior wings, and scarcely as long as the body. 

 Maxillary palpi long, folded, five-jointed. Labial palpi cylindric, scaly, the 

 second article with bristles, especially at the apex above, third article small and 

 somewhat deflexed. Tongue very short, not as long as the labial" palpi. Wings 

 exceeding the tip of the abdomen ; the anterior oblong-ovate, with moderate api- 

 cal cilia ; posterior ovate, clothed with scales, and with long cilia behind. 



The following species are represented in my collection and may be tabulated 

 as follows : 



\ A semi pellucid discal spot on under surface of fore wings. 

 f Fore wings without a dorsal streak. 

 Biflavimaculella. Dark brown, tinged with violet, with a very" pale yel- 

 low costo-discal patch and one above interior angle, 

 f f Fore wings with a dorsal streak. 

 Do r si s t rige 1 la . Dark brown, with a costo-discal very pale yellowish 



patch. 

 Crocicapitella. Fuscous, with a discal yellowish spot. 



\\ No discal spot on under surface of fore wings. 

 Carnariella. Yellow-brown dusted with fuscous : a discal and two inter- 

 mediate dark brown spots. 

 L a n a r i e 1 1 a . Pale yellowish brown, or a silky pale yellow, with sometimes 



a brownish discal spot. 

 Nubilipennella. Dark fuscous, dusted with dull yellowish. 

 Variatella. Whitish, varied with dark brown, with white costal and dor- 

 sal spots. 



Medio-superior and central nervules of fore wings arise on a common stalk; last branch 



of subcostal bifid. 



T. biflavimaculella . Palpi pale yellowish, dark brown externally, 

 antennas dark fuscous, darkest toward the base. Head and front luteoue. 

 Thorax dark brown. Abdomen dark grey. Fore wiDgs umber brown, tinged 

 with a violet hue, especially toward the tip, where it prevails. On the middle 

 of costa, a pale yellow, somewhat triangular patch extended to the dise, and a 

 dorsal patch of the same hue at the interior angle ; cilia dark colored, dotted 

 on the posterior margin of the wing with pale yell&w. Hind wings grey, with 

 a bronzy hue. Exp. a!. *3 . f j lines.

258 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



Medio superior and central nervules branch from a common stalk. 



T. dorsistrigella . Labial palpi yellowish, dark brown externally, third 

 article yellowish. Head and front very pale yellow, tinged with dark brown 

 on the sides above the eyes, and at base of antennae. Antennae dull brown. 

 Thorax dark brown, with the disk very pale yellow. Fore wings blackish 

 brown, somewhat tinged with obscure reddish, with a dorsal streak along the 

 inner margin, whitish or pale yellowish white, and usually somewhat dilated 

 above the interior angle ; with a costo-discal patch of the same hue and the 

 costa punctated with pale yellowish atoms, which become small spots toward 

 the apex of the wing, and on the posterior margin. Hind wings pale brownish, 

 with a reddish hue; cilia gray. Exp. al. 4.75 to 6.00 lines. 



T. c r o c i c ap it e 1 la. Labial palpi yellowish, dark brown externally. 

 Head and front saffron yellow. Thorax dark fuscous, with the disk saffron 

 yellow. Fore wings dark fuscous, with dispersed saffron yellow scales, espe- 

 cially along the casta, with a saffron yellow dorsal streak and a paler, nearly 

 round discal spot. Hind wings pale brownish gray. Exp. al. 4.50 to 6.50 

 lines. 



T. carnariella . Palpi dark brown. Head and front rather dark ochre- 

 ous, tinged with reddish. Fore wings pale yellowish brown, dusted with fus^ 

 cous, especially at the costal portion of the base ; with a conspicuous dark brown 

 spot on the end of the dise, with two smaller spots of the same hue between this 

 and the base of the wing, one about the middle of the disc, and the other be- 

 neath it in the submedian fold ; fringes unicolorons and rather paler than the 

 general hue. Hind wings pale bluish gray ; fringes somewhat darker. Exp. 

 al. 5.50 to 7.50 lines. 



This species, perhaps, may have been heretofore described under another 

 name ; but if it has, I have been unable to recognize it. 1 have two specimens 

 only in my collection. The larvae were found in one of my boxes of Lepidoptera, 

 and had constructed cases of detached portions of the insects and the scales, 

 united by silk. The imago appeared, one on March 13th, and the other some 

 days subsequently. 



The eggs were whitish, smooth and nearly cylindrical, but tnpering slightly 

 toward the upper end. Length about one fourth of a line, diameter one half 

 the length. The mature larva was of a dirty white color, with a black head and 

 black cervical shield, 



T. lanariella . Head ochreous. Labial palpi dark brownish. Antennas 

 dull fuscous. Thorax and abdomen pale yellow. Fore wings pale yellowish 

 brown or pale yellow, with a silky lustre, and immaculate ; sometimes slightly 

 dusted with fuscous on the costa at the base, and with a brownish spot on the 

 end of the disc. Hind wings pale shining yellow, cilia the same. Exp. al. 

 5.50 to 6.50 lines. 



I am not sure this is not a variety of the previous species, and has, perhaps, 

 been heretofore described, as it is a very common inhabitant of houses. The 

 larvae feed on woollen substances, carpets, clothes, etc., of which each con- 

 structs a case. I have reared a great many in confinement, and have also 

 found that they feed on the bodies of their dead progenitors, when the oppor- 

 tunity offers. 



I find the egg described in my note book as spheroidal and of large size for 

 so small an insect ; I doubt, however, the correctness of the term descriptive of 

 the figure. The young larvae appear after about two weeks, and dp not im- 

 mediately make a case. The mature larva is white, with a dark brown head 

 and a cervical shield of the same hue. They reach maturity about the middle 

 of March, and climb the sides of the walls to the ceiling of the room in which 

 they feed, and suspend'or attach their cases. The imagos of the first brood 

 appear about the beginning of May ; there is another in August and Sep- 

 tember.

 Eead and front dull fuscous or brownish yellow. Antennae dull dark brown. 

 Thorax brownish yellow. Fore wings deep fuscous, sprinkled with dull yel- 

 lowish, with a yellowish spot on the inner margin at the base, and the middle 

 of the inner margin tinged with the same hue ; with a deep fuscous spot 

 at the end of the disc and two others of the same hue rather indistinct, one in. 

 the fold beyond the middle, the other on the disc and a little posterior to it. 

 Sometimes the dull yellowish hue prevails, freely dusted with deep fuscous, 

 and with the spots more distinct than in the darker specimens. Hind 

 wings bluish, shining gray, with the cilia of the same hue. Ex. al. 5.50 to 6.50 

 lines.

 white. Thorax gray, with tegulae black, tipped behind with gray. Abdomen 

 blackish. Antennas blackish brown. Fore wings whitish, varied witli dark 

 brown and blackish ; with a dark brown streak containing blackish scales, 

 curving somewhat from the costa at the base to the fold ; with a blackish brown 

 spot on the fold, rather before the middle, slightly connected with one of the 

 same hue nearer the base on the costa; with a dark brown, somewhat oblique 

 patch about the end of the disc and one at the tip of the wing, and with the 

 apical portion dusted with the same hue ; a few white spots on the cilia of the 

 inner margin, and on the costa behind the discal patch; before the discal patch 

 are two well marked white spots on the costa, the one nearest the discal patch 

 having a blackish central dot ; the inner margin, toward the base, white, varied 

 with dark brown stria? ; cilia grayish, Hind wings dark brown, rather tinged 

 with reddish, cilia the same. Exp. al. 5.5 lines. 



Imago on wing in September. 



Xylesthia. 



Head roughly haired. Ocelli none. Eyes round, visible in front. Antennae 

 filiform, with whorls of scales on each article, and the basal joint with a tuft 

 of scales in front that conceals it, not as long as the body and about one-half 

 as long as the fore wing3. Maxillary palpi very short, scaly and concealed 

 beneath the labial palpi. Labial palpi cylindric, with a tuft of hair beneath, 

 and with lateral bristles ; the third article smooth and quite short. Tongue 

 not quite as long as the palpi. Wings exceeding the body; the anterior oblong 

 ovate, with elevated tufts of scales ; the posterior ovate, with the costa excavated 

 at the insertion of the costal nervure. 



X. pruniramiella . Antenna? yellowish white. Palpi and head hoary. 

 Thorax hoary, dusted with brownish. Abdomen dark brown. Fore wings 

 blackish brown and luteous brown, somewhat varied with whitish, with patches 

 of elevated scales at the base and along the fold ; with an indistinct whitish 

 band crossing the middle of the disc, one nearer the base still fainter and one 

 about the end of the disc, with a white dorsal spot at the inner angle and a 

 whitish streak from the costa above it, with another whitish costal streak be- 

 tween this and the tip ; a blackish spot at the tip white margined before ; cilia 

 brownish, white at the dorsal spot. The luteo brownish hue usually prevails 

 toward the tip of the wiog and sometimes the whitish markings are indistinct. 

 Hind wings dark brown, somewhat tinged with reddish, cilia the same. Exp. 

 al. 6 to 6.5 lines. 



The larva of this insect feeds on the woody excrescences found on the 

 branches of the plum tree. These nodose tumors have recently attracted the 

 fruit-grower's attention, but I am unable to say whether the larva is the cause 

 of the disease. It does not confine its operations to the cortical portion of the 

 node, but bores the wood likewise.. I have found it associated with another 

 much larger larva, but the imago of the only specimen I received, escaped 



1859.] 




260 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



from the vivarium before I saw it. Both pass the winter in the larval state, 

 and may be taken in recent excrescences, during the latter part of April or the 

 beginning of May, and become imagos in JuDe. The larva is dirty whitish iu 

 color, with a brown head and shield, and scarcely one-half an inch long ; the 

 larger larva is quite an inch in length, with no distinctive markings. Pruni- 

 ramielea makes its cocoon of " frass " and silk in a gallery formed in the 

 wood, but near the surface. The pupa has minute spines on the dorsum and 

 is thrust from the cocoon at maturity. 



The following species, I believe, forms a new genus. It is rather rare, at 

 least I have met with the imago but few times. I know nothing of its embry- 

 onic states. In appearance the imago bears considerable resemblance to the 

 figures of Euplocamus B o 1 e t i of Europe, but its generic characters separate it 

 from the latter very distinctly. 



Amydbia. 



Head free, as broad as the thorax, roughly haired, (the hairs of the front 

 ascending and those of the vertex inclined from each side toward the median 

 line, or having a stelliform arrangement behind the antennae.) Ocelli none. 

 Eyes small, hemispherical and salient. Antennas simple in both sexes, moder- 

 ately thick, with joints closely set and with whorls of scales, one-half us long 

 as the fore wings and scarcely two-thirds as long as the body. Maxillary palpi 

 extremely small and 2-jointed. Labial palpi with the second article beneath hairy 

 and formed like a brush; the third, slender and ascending. Tongue wanting. 

 Wings narrow, much exceeding the tip of the abdomen; the anterior, elliptical, 

 cilia rather long, especially at the inner angle, giving the wing the appearance 

 of being angulated ; posterior, obtusely ovate, with moderately long cilia 

 behind. 



A. effrentella. Labial palpi yellowish brown, with the second article 

 dark brown exteriorly. Head and front yellowish brown. Thorax dark brown, 

 varied with yellowish. Fore wings fuscous, varied with yellow, which prevails 

 along the inner margin, with fuscous spots around the apical margin, and in the 

 $ a large discal fuscous patch. The fore wings of the ^ have more of the 

 yellowish hue than the 9 ; c ^i a yellowish. Hind wings pale brownish yel- 

 low, cilia the same. Exp. al. 8 to 11 lines. 



The following species likewise form a new genus, at least I am not aware 

 that any has been formed into which they can be received. Plumifron- 

 t el la is found here in June and July, when it may be taken at light. I am 

 unacquainted with the embryonic history of the species described, and have 

 never met with the female Plumifrontella. The genus, I think, belongs 

 to the group E x a pa ti dae , and as the females in some of the genera are 

 apterous, that of Plumifrontella may be unsupplied with wings. The 

 antennae should be examined very carefully, otherwise their peculiar structure 

 will be overlooked and mistaken for simple, filiform organs. 



Anaphora. 



Head hairy, concealed by the labial palpi in the tf, free in the 9 Ocelli 

 none. Eyes small. Antennae but little longer than the thorax, serrated beneath, 

 with the ends of the articles finely ciliated. Maxillary palpi moderately long, scaly 

 and 3-jointed in both $ and $> . Labial palpi in the $ greatly developed,

Description of a deformed, fragmentary Human Skull, found in an ancient 

 quarry-cave at Jerusalem ; with, an attempt to determine by its configuration 

 alone the Ethnical Type to which it belongs. 



BY J. AITKEN MEIGS, M. D. 



In September, 1857, Mr. J. Judson Barclay kindly presented to the Academy 

 a fragmentary human cranium discovered by him in an immense quarry-cave 

 at Jerusalem. 



The location in which this skull was found, the circumstances attending its 

 discovery, and the very peculiar form which it exhibits, in consequence of the 

 perpendicular flatness of the occiput, render it highly interesting to the cranio- 

 grapher. 



From a communication* which appeared in the Ladies^ Cliristian Annual for 

 May, 1855, and a letter dated Philadelphia, Aug. 21st, 1857, addressed to the 

 writer by Mr. Barclay,! I gather the following interesting particulars concern- 

 ing the finding of this skull. 



Having received some information of the existence of a very extensive cave 

 near the Damascus gate of Jerusalem, (entirely unknown to Franks,) Mr. 

 Barclay, in conjunction with his father and brother, resolved upon its exploration. 

 Accordingly, having obtained permission to this effect, from the Nazir Effendi, 

 they repaired to the cave, the mouth of which is situated directly below the city 

 wall, and the houses on Bezetha. They found the wall at this spot about ten 

 feet in thickness. Through a narrow, serpentine passage which traverses it they 

 gained an entrance into the cave. The length of the cavern they estimated

at seven hundred and fifty feet, and the circumference upwards of three 

 thousand feet. The roof is supported by numerous regular pillars hewn out 

 of the solid limestone rock. The floor from the entrance to the termination 

 forms an inclined plane, the descent of which is in some places very rapid. 

 About 100 feet from the entrance a very deep and precipitous pit was dis- 

 covered containing a human skeleton ; supposed to be that of some unfortu- 

 nate who had fallen headlong down and broken his neck, or rather his skull, 

 judging from the fracture which it exhibits. The bones, of almost giant pro- 

 portions, gave evidence, from their decayed state, of having remained in that 

 position for many years. The skull, unlike the rest of the skeleton, was in a 

 remarkable state of preservation. Numerous crosses on the wall indicate that 

 the devout Pilgrim or Crusader had been there ; and a few Arabic and Hebrew 

 inscriptions too much effaced to be deciphered prove that the place was not 

 unknown to the Jew and the Arab. The explorers found many intricate, 

 meandering passages leading to immense halls as white as the driven snow, 

 and supported by colossal pillars of irregular shape ; some of them placed 

 there by the hand of nature, others of them evidently by the stone quarriers 

 to prevent the intumbling of the city. From their explorations the party con- 

 cluded that this cavern and the Grotto of Jeremiah, two or three hundred 

 yards distant, originally constituted one immense cave which was formerly 

 the great quarry of Jerusalem. 



The cave appears, therefore, to be a very old one. An allusion to it under 

 the name of the " Cotton Grotto " is made by Kadi Mejr-ed-din in an Arabic MS., 

 entitled " The Sublime Companion to the History of Jerusalem and Hebron," 

 and bearing date, A. D. 1495. A gentleman who entered the cave subse- 

 quently to the visit of the Messrs. Barclay, tells us, in the " Boston Traveller," 

 that though its existence was long suspected, "nothing was positively known 

 regarding it, as it has been kept carefully closed by the successive governors 

 of Jerusalem. The mouth of the cavern was probably walled up as early as 

 the times of the crusades, to prevent its falling into the hands of a besieging 

 army ; earth was thrown up against this wall, so as effectually to conceal it 

 from view, and it is only upon the closest scrutiny that the present entrance 

 can be perceived." Piles of stone chippings, and blocks of stone but half- 

 quarried, and still attached by one side to the rock, were encountered in dif- 

 ferent parts of the cave. The marks of the cutting instruments were as plain 

 and well-defined as if the workman had but just ceased from his labor. Those 

 who visited the cave were of the opinion that it had been worked as a quarry 

 during the days of Solomon. The following reasons appear to fav6r this 

 opinion. The stone is the same as that of the portions of the Temple wall 

 still remaining, and referred by Dr. Robinson to the period of the first build- 

 ing. From the former entrance of the cave to the Temple area is a gently in- 

 clined plane a fact that suggests a satisfactory solution of what has hereto- 

 fore been regarded as a very puzzling question the difficulty of placing such 

 immense masses of rock in situ, as those found at the south-east and south- 

 west corners of the Temple wall. The heaps of chippings which lie about 

 show that the stone was dressed on the spot, which accords with the account 

 of the building of the Temple. To these reasons we may also add the extent 

 of the quarry, trie amount of stone which must have been worked out there, the 

 size of some of the blocks themselves, the extreme age of the part which has 

 been exposed to the action of the elements, and which dates back in legends 

 and traditions to the time of Jeremiah, the fact that there are no other quar- 

 ries of any great size near the city, and especially the fact that in the reign of 

 Solomon this quarry, in its whole extent, was without the limits of the city. 



In the absence of any positive evidence to be derived from the skull itself, 

 these statements are introduced here as being calculated to throw some light 

 upon the question of its antiquity ormodernness, and consequently, to a certain 

 extent, its nationality.

The cranium found in this cave (No. 1031 of the collection) is probably that 

 of a man setat, about 40 or 45 years. In structure it is moderately dense and 

 heavy, and from its general appearance would scarcely be regarded as an an- 

 cient skull. It is, unfortunately, in a very fragmentary condition, consisting 

 of the two ossa parietalia, the left temporal, nearly all that part of the os oc- 

 cipitis posterior to the foramen magnum, and enough of the frontal bone to 

 determine the calvarial form. The facial, right temporal and basal bones are 

 altogether wanting. It has evidently been a short, broad and high skull. The 

 coronal region is triangular in shape, with the truncated apex of the triangle 

 directed anteriorly and coinciding with the frontal diameter. The skull be- 

 longs therefore to the Triangular Type of the Class Brachyplatupsidse the 25th 

 in the new and complete classification of human crania, which I propose to 

 bring before the Academy at some future time. The bi-frontal diameter 

 measures about 4 inches ; the bi-parietal, between the ossific centres, 6 in- 

 ches ; the vertical diameter, from the posterior edge of the foramen magnum 

 to the highest point of the crown directly above, 6f inches ; the intermeatous 

 diameter about 2J inches. The antero-posterior or longitudinal diameter of 

 the head must have measured about 6^ or 6| inches. The occipital bone 

 rises vertically from the posterior margin of the great foramen to meet the 

 parietalia which bend abruptly downward between their lateral protuberances. 

 This striking peculiarity gives to the posterior part of the head the same 

 broad, high and perpendicularly flattened appearance, so characteristic of 

 Peruvian Crania. The superior transverse ridge of the occipital bone is well- 

 defined ; and-the occipital protuberance sharp and prominent. The mastoid 

 process of the temporal bone is large and massive. 



Upon the inner surface of the left side, and directly opposite the parietal 

 centre of ossification, there is a solution of continuity in the vitreous table. 

 Both the vitreous and diploic structures at this spot have decayed away or been 

 absorbed, leaving a cavity of an irregularly oval shape, and about five-eighths of 

 an inch long, and half an inch wide. Judging from several minute fissures which 

 radiate in different directions from th edges of this cavity, the latter is the 

 result of a blow, which, without affecting the outer or fibrous, has been strong 

 enough to fracture the inner table. A portion of the surrounding surface of 

 the skull, extending about one inch from the margin of the cavity, is stained 

 of a reddish or iron-rust color. 



The muscles attached to the sharp external occipital protuberance, to the 

 well pronounced superior and inferior semi-circular lines or ridges of the os 

 occipitis, and the intervening rough surface must have been well developed, 

 so that the nape of the neck formed, in all probability, a plane continuous 

 with the back of the head. When with this peculiarity we couple the fact 

 that, owing to the relative position of the external auditory meati, the ears 

 must have appeared to be attached rather to the back part than to the sides of 

 the head, we can readily imagine that the individual to whom the skull be- 

 longed must have presented quite a bizarre appearance. The glenoid fossa of 

 the left side remains intact and is especially worthy of notice, since it happens 

 to constitute in this skull the only connecting link or point of attachment be- 

 tween the calvaria and the missing bones of the face. If the Cuvierian law of 

 the correlation or harmonization of forms could be practically applied to the 

 separate pieces composing the human cranium, this fossa would assume a still 

 greater importance, since by means of it the outline of the bony face could be 

 determined, and the observer having, in this indirect way, obtained an exact 

 idea of the shape of the entire head, could proceed more confidently to indi- 

 cate the precise ethnic type of which this skull is a specimen. 



Impracticable, however, as this is, we can approximate the desired informa- 

 tion by observing attentively the exact appearance of this fossa. The zygomatic 

 tubercle is well marked ; the eminentia articitlaris, instead of being flatly 

 rounded, as is ordinarily the case, is sharp and well defined, while the anterior 



[Sept.' 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 265 



wall of the glenoid cavity is thick and unusually convex. Instead of shelving 

 backwards and upwards from the articular eminence, as is usually the case, 

 particularly, as I am inclined to think, in long heads, it rises abruptly and 

 almost perpendicularly, giving the fossa somewhat the appearance presented 

 by this cavity in the carnivora, and indicating powerful up and down move- 

 ments of the lower jaw, with diminished lateral action. The lateral motion of 

 the jaw must have been still more restrained by the backward inclination of 

 the internal end of the inferior root of the zygoma. The condyle adapted to 

 such a fossa must have been large and heavy, with a correspondingly short 

 and thick neck. Such characters indicate a heavy, square jaw, with short 

 rami and a flattened or retracted symphysis menti. Corresponding with this, 

 as the head is brachykephalic, the superior maxilla must have been heavy and 

 flat and the malar bones prominent. Reasoning thus we may infer from the 

 glenoid cavity that the face of this skull partook of the Tschudic or even ap- 

 proximated the Mongolian form. 



It is, perhaps, impossible to say positively whether this skull be a very old 

 or quite a modem one. A knowledge of the precise epoch to which it should 

 be referred, would assist somewhat in the determination of its nationality. I 

 have already said that from its appearance it can scarcely be regarded as an 

 ancient skull. Yet the appearance and degree of density of bones are by no 

 means reliable criteria of their age ; for it is well known that bones of the 

 same age exhibit great dissimilarity in these respects, according to the location 

 in which they have been deposited, according as they have been buried in 

 the ground, deposited in caverns, submerged in water, or freely exposed upon 

 the surface of the earth to air and light. The quantity and quality of the 

 mineral and saline matters contained in the water in which such bones may 

 have been placed, the nature of the soil in which they may have been inhumed, 

 and other circumstances, are known to exert, in the course of time, peculiar 

 changes in both the animal and earthy matter. But the data by which to 

 determine with certainty the time required to produce such changes are want- 

 ing. Equally recent bones deposited in the same cave at the same time often 

 exhibit very different appearances after the lapse of many years. And yet the 

 circumstances of location, and the absence or presence of animal matter, are 

 the only, and, it must be confessed, very unreliable criteria by which to de- 

 termine the age of bony remains. A piece of the Jerusalem skull pressed 

 against the tongue adheres slightly. A small fragment was pulverized, 

 treated with ether, washed and thoroughly dried by exposure to a gentle heat. 

 One drachm of the bone thus treated was macerated in a mixture consisting of 

 three parts water and two parts hydrochloric acid. In eleven hours it 

 was thoroughly dissolved, the solution being accompanied at first with a 

 moderately active liberation of carbonic acid gas. A few pellicles of a gelatin- 

 ous matter that had collected upon the surface of the liquid were removed 

 and carefully dried. They weighed 11 grains. Sulphuric acid was then added 

 to the liquid drop by drop until there was no longer any precipitation of lime. 

 The supernatant liquid was poured off, and the sulphate of lime effectually dried 

 by exposure to the sun and afterwards to the heat of an oven. It weighed 48 

 grains. One grain of the original weight was thus lost in the process. From 

 this rough analysis it will be seen that the bones composing the skull under 

 consideration contain a less percentage of animal and a greater percentage of 

 calcareous matter than is contained in decidedly recent bones, A piece of an 

 ancient Burgundian skull, reported to be some 2000 years old, a fragment of 

 the skull of an ancient Roman, ;found in the tomb on the road between Cumse 

 and the ruins of Baise, and a fragment of the skull of a young aboriginal female 

 taken from an ancient tomb at Ticul in Yucatan, were subjected to the same 

 analytical process. They were found to consist almost wholly of earthy matter. 

 The animal matter had almost entirely disappeared. These bones were dis- 

 solved in a much less time than the piece from the Jerusalem skull, and their 

 solution gave rise to a very active formation and escape of gas.

Great interest attaches to this skull on account of the fact that it presents 

 an excellent opportunity to test the differential value of certain craniographic 

 characters, those pertaining to the crown, occiput and temporal region. The 

 true value of craniographic criteria has not yet been settled. The special 

 investigations in this branch of natural science are as yet too limited, and 

 many of them have been undertaken in such a hasty and unphilosophical 

 spirit, and with such imperfect views of the method that rules in craniography, 

 that the generalizations thus far effected are not only few in number and of 

 limited application, but have to be used in the most careful and discriminating 

 manner. It is well known to the members of the Academy that a skull in the 

 collection marked Phoenician* was sent by M. Fresnel, the celebrated archaeolo- 

 gist, to the late Dr. Morton, without the slightest information as to where, 

 or the circumstances under which it was found. After a careful study of 

 its race characters, Dr.j M. pronounced it to be a Phoenician. He afterwards 

 learned from Fresnel that it was found in the sepulchral cave of Ben-Djemma, in 

 the Island of Malta, and probably belonged to an individual of that race, which, 

 in the most remote times, had occupied the northern coast of Africa and the 

 adjacent isles, f It will thus appear that Dr. M., guided by osteologic charac- 

 ters alone, was enabled to announce the correct geographical locality of this 

 skull, and perhaps also its true ethnic value, though of this latter point I 

 entertain, at present, some doubts, arising from the remarkable resemblance 

 which this skull bears to that of a wandering Chingan of Transylvania, de- 

 picted in Blumenbach's Decades (Tab. ii.) In like manner, some time before 

 his death, Dr. Prichard sent to Prof. Retzius two human crania, requesting an 

 opinion as to the race to which they belonged. He pronounced one of them 

 to be Roman and the other Celtic, and was informed by Prichard that he was 

 in all probability correct, for the two skulls had been dug up in an old battle- 

 field at York, England, where the ancient British Celts, the Belgas Brittanorum, 

 had been vanquished by the Romans. t Another instance, similar to these, 

 will presently be referred to. With such examples before me, I have been led 

 to attempt, as far as the materials at my command would allow, to identify 

 ethnically the skull from Jerusalem. It will be borne in mind that Drs. 

 Prichard, Morton and Retzius had entire skulls submitted to them. The skull 

 from Jerusalem, on the contrary, is, as we have just seen, in a very fragmentary 

 state. It may be said that the knowledge of the locality in which this skull 

 was found would assist materially in this investigation. But that this is not 

 the case will at once be seen when we call to mind that this locality has been, 

 for centuries, a great rendezvous for many races of men, coming from various 

 parts of Europe, Asia and Africa. Moreover the skull is somewhat unique, 

 not only in its form, (of which there is not the exact counterpart in the whole 

 Mortonian collection, ) but also in the fact that none others were found with 

 it. Desirous of ascertaining whether any other skulls, similar in form to 

 the one under consideration, had been discovered in Palestine, I examined 

 a number of works of travel. At length, in the second volume of such a 

 work published at Dublin in 1840, and entitled "Narrative of a voyage to 

 Madeira, Teneriffe, and along the shores of the Mediterranean, by W. R. 

 Wilde, M. R. I. A., &c," I came across a curious account of the discovery of 

 some human skulls in one of the ancient tombs near Jerusalem. 



During his sojourn in Jerusalem Dr. Wilde learned that within the ground 

 denominated Aceldama, or Field of Blood, (situated to the south of Mt. Sion,

in the Valley of Hinnom, and close to the Mount of Offence,) and in the neigh- 

 borhood of the painted chambers and the excavation called the tomb of Isaiah, 

 some Arabs had accidentally discovered the doorway of a tomb carved out of 

 the solid rock and concealed by a heap of rubbish, over which the soil had 

 accumulated so as completely to hide the entrance. The doorway represented 

 a Doric pediment, supported by rude pilasters, with some remains of floral 

 embellishments, characteristic of Hebrew sculpture, carved upon the archi- 

 trave. The interior of the tomb consisted of an oblong hall, cut with great 

 precision out of the rock, and having at the inner end and on each side, a 

 number of doors leading into small, oblong chambers or crypts, about seven 

 feet long. On each side of these crypts was a trough or sarcophagus, hewn 

 out of the solid rock, and filled with confused heaps of human bones in an 

 astonishing state of preservation. Each set of crypts contained the skulls of 

 distinct races of mankind. Dr. Wilde secured four of these crania, carried 

 them to Europe, and through Dr. Graves of Dublin, sent casts of them to Dr. 

 Prichard for examination. All the crypts on the right hand side of the tomb 

 contained dense, heavy crania of a long, narrow form, with a flat, recedent 

 forehead, very well marked superciliary ridges, and a prognathous superior 

 maxilla. They evidently belonged to the African type. The skulls in the left 

 hand crypts were of a shape the very reverse, as shown in plate 2, fig. 4 of 

 Dr. Wilde's lithographic illustrations. " Although this skull," says the Dr., 

 " differs in some respects from the true Mongolian, yet under that variety it 

 must be classed. Its most striking character is its very remarkable narrow- 

 ness in its longitudinal diameter, not only in contradistinction to the Ethio- 

 pian, which is characterised by extensive length, but in comparison with all 

 other known crania. It has an uncommon breadth aud flatness of the occipital or 

 posterior region ; and the very remarkable protuberance at the top of the head 

 gives this skull a place among those termed pyramidal." Dr. Prichard re- 

 garded this skull as of Turkish origin, approaching the true Mongolian type 

 more closely than any other. Dr. Wilde considers it probable that the skull 

 appertained to some of the Turcoman tribes which still wander in hordes over 

 the countries anciently named Parthia, Mesopotamia, Cappadocia and Pam- 

 phylia. 



From the above description it will be seen that this skull resembles the 

 fragmentary cranium from Jerusalem. The two appear to belong to closely 

 related types or forms, as may be demonstrated by comparing the fragment 

 Tinder consideration with the drawing given by Dr. Wilde. The form shown 

 in the latter is not the true Turkish as Dr. Prichard supposed. Had he com- 

 pared Dr. Wilde's specimen, as I have Mr. Barclay's, with the skull of a Turk 

 figured by Blumenbach, (Table 2,) he would have seen that though alike in 

 the shortness of the longitudinal diameter, they are too dissimilar in the con- 

 figuration of the occiput to be regarded as specimens of the same cranial type. 

 It must be borne in mind, however, that Dr. Prichard frequently used the 

 term "Turkish" as synonymous with Mongolian. Into this too compre- 

 hensive use of the term he appears to have been betrayed, in consequence ot 

 having adopted the questionable opinion of Remusat, Klaproth and Ritter, that 

 the Turks are not a distinct people, ab origine, but descendants of the Hiong- 

 Nu, who, anterior to the Christian era, threatened to overrun and subjugate 

 China with their mighty hordes.* Domalius D'Halloyf and Latham} assign 

 to the Turks a Scythic origin. The latter expressly says that he considers the 

 Mongoliform physiognomy to be the rule with the Turk and not the exception, 

 and that the Turk of Turkey exhibits the exceptional character of his family. 

 I can find no good reason for thus confounding the Mongolians proper with the

Turks. Judging from the figure in Blumenbach's Decades, above alluded to, 

 the Turks are craniographically distinct from the Tartars and the Kalmucks, 

 and should he regarded, as I have elsewhere maintained,* as an originally 

 peculiar race, standing mid-way between the European and the Mongol, with 

 which they are transitionally connected by sub-types, which have resulted 

 from a double amalgamation on the part of the Turk, whose genealogical im- 

 purity we know to be very great. In the absence of Turkish crania in the 

 collection, I am not able to speak positively upon this subject. In the Museum 

 of the Army Medical Department, Fort Pitt, Chatham, England, there are two 

 skulls obtained from the Turkish burial ground at Scutari. These are de- 

 scribed by Dr. Williamson, in the following words : "No. 18. Cranium large, 

 round, and very capacious ; forehead high ; vertex high, and very well 

 arched ; occiput rounded ; space for the downward development of the cere- 

 bellum considerable ; nasal bones well arched. No. 19. Cranium very large 

 and capacious, and exceedingly well arched ; forehead high and broad ; vertex 

 high, and occiput well rounded ; facial bones well placed ; the alveolar pro- 

 cesses perpendicular, and the facial angle very high ; lachrymal canal large."! 

 The Turkish cranium is nearly globular, and though the external, occipital 

 protuberance is but little developed, yet the occiput as a whole is rounded, 

 and not vertically flattened as in Dr. Wilde's specimen, and the fragment 

 found by Mr. Barclay. The latter is therefore not Turkish. Neither is it 

 Jewish, for the Semitic skull, judging from the specimens in the collection of 

 the Academy, is a long oval in form. Thus No. 842, the skull of a Theban 

 Hebrew, aetat. 40 years, X belongs to the dolicho-kephalic class of Retzius. The 

 crown is oval in shape, and the occiput regularly rounded. Nos. 818, 845, 

 865 and 870 exhibit the same general form, as may be seen by referring to the 

 lithographic representations of these skulls in the Crania ^Egyptiaca of Mor- 

 ton.^ No. 807|| is an oblong and somewhat angular head, with a perceptible 

 flatness of the basal portion of the occiput, which renders the occipital protu- 

 berance apparently more prominent than in the other skulls of this group. 

 No. 879, ^ though preserving the oval configuration, is not so long a head as 

 the others. In the 28th and 34th Tables of the Decades Craniorum, Blumen- 

 bach figures two Jewish skulls, one of a young person and the other of a 

 centenarian. Unfortunately they are represented neither in profile nor in 

 posterior view, and it is impossible, therefore, to determine satisfactorily the 

 shape of the occipital region, or even the general form of the skull. In de- 

 scribing the physical characters of the Semitic Atlantidse, (Arabians, Jews and 

 Kaldani or Syrians of Kurdistan,) Latham says that these people possess 

 " dolikhokephalic capacious crania, with straight or prominent nasal and 

 orthognathic maxillary profiles."** In another place he says that the cranium 

 of the Jew differs from that of the Arab in its greater capacity.ft Dr. Wil- 

 liamson describes a " Skull from the Jews' burial ground, on the road to Kolla- 

 lie," in the following terms : " Forehead low and and receding ; posterior part 

 of the cranium large compared to the anterior ; superciliary ridge high and

very prominent ; nasal bones arched with a depression at their root.* Hamil- 

 ton Smith on the other hand speaks of the "beautiful spherical cranium of 

 the Jews, as fine as the Arabian or Circassian ;"f and in a recent work on the 

 Condition of Women and Children among the Celtic, Gothic and other nations, it is 

 asserted that the "Jews have, generally speaking, crania like the Saxons and 

 Goths short and broad," p. (69). This statement is certainly erroneous. 

 The Jewish crania in the Academy's collection are, as we have just seen, long 

 and ovoidal, with a comparatively receding forehead, and as Morton long ago 

 observed, a strong and often harsh development of the whole facial structure. 

 In his interesting work, entitled Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Baby- 

 lon, Layard figures a bas-relief disinterred from Sennacherib's palace at Kou- 

 yunjik, and representing certain Jewish captives from Lachish. "These cap- 

 tives," he says, "were undoubtedly Jews, their physiognomy was strikingly 

 indicated in the sculptures." A glance at these figures is sufficient to show 

 that they belong, not to the short, but the long-headed races of men. The Jews 

 are justly classed, therefore, by Retzius among the Asiatic Dolichokephalse.t 



The Arab skulls in the collection, with the exception of No. 780, are entire- 

 ly different from the fragment under consideration. No. 129(3 is an oval, 

 dolicho-kephalic head. No. 781 is an oblong head with the occipital region 

 flattened superiorly, as in the Norwegian and Swedish skulls, and the oc- 

 cipital protuberance quite prominent. No. 784 is a long head approximating 

 the oval form. Behind the mastoid processes it is quite broad, and the oc- 

 cipital region is full and rounded. No. 780 is a shorter head than the other. 

 The crown exhibits the triangular form of that of the fragments from Jerusa- 

 lem, but the triangle is longer. The occiput though flattened is not so de- 

 cidedly flat as in the fragment. 



This fragment differs also entirely from the Fellah skulls in the collection, 

 not only in length but also in the configuration of the crown and the occiput. 

 Upon comparing it with the series of Egyptian skulls, I find that we cannot 

 ascribe to it an Egyptian origin. It is a curious fact, however, and one worthy 

 of mention in this connection, that among the figures in Crania JEgyptica, 

 selected from Rosellini's great work by Dr. Morton to illustrate the Egyptian 

 type of head, there are several which I am strongly inclined to think are not 

 at all Egyptian. Two of these (Fig. 4, p. 34, and Fig. 3, p. 35) are evidently 

 brachykephalic heads. In both, the hind head is vertically flattened. The 

 former resembles the square or round-headed German, the latter calls to mind 

 the Peruvian form. The first outline is that of the Harper in Bruce's tomb at 

 Thebes ; the second is a cook, who in the tomb of Rameses the Fourth, at 

 Thebes, is represented with many others in the active duties of his vocation. 



Before proceeding further in the attempt to determine the race to which the 

 Jerusalem skull belongs, it will be-useful to enumerate the very different races 

 of men that have at different times occupied Jerusalem and its vicinity. 



From the Acts of the Apostles we learn that during the first century pf the 

 Christian era, there were assembled at Jerusalem, besides the Jews, Parthians, 

 Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians, Judeans, Cappadocians, natives of Pontus, 

 Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Libya about Cyrene, Rome, Crete and 

 Arabia. Long after this we know that crowds of pilgrims were attracted to 

 Jerusalem " from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, and the most distant coun- 

 tries of the East." Among these pilgrims, Jerome, cited by Gibbon, || mentions 

 the Britons and the Indians. Three centuries later, (A. D. 614,) the Holy

City fell into the hands of the Persian King Chosroes II. In 637 it was con- 

 quered by the Saracens, and again became a resort for pilgrims from various 

 parts of the old world. Then it was under the sway of the house of Seljuk ; 

 the Turcomans under Ortok having hereditary command of the city and neigh- 

 boring territory. At length Ortok was driven out by the Egyptians, who in 

 their turn yielded the possession of the holy city to the Crusaders under God- 

 frey of Bouillon. From the time of Godfrey down to the fall of Acre and the 

 cessation of the Crusades in 1291, a period of some 200 years, the City of the 

 Great King and all Palestine became the sanguinary arena in which the natives 

 of Great Britain, Frenchmen, Flemings, Belgians, Normans, Scandinavian 

 cruisers from the Baltic, Bavarians, Bohemians, Caiinthians, Piedmontese, 

 Styrians, Genoese, South Italians, &c, on the one hand, contended with Mus- 

 sulmen, Mamelukes and the Kharizmian horde from Mongolia on the other, 

 for the possession of the Holy Sepulchre. 



Two interesting questions here present themselves. Does this skull belong 

 to any of the races of men, which in successive waves have swept over and 

 occupied, for varying periods of time, the Holy City and surrounding country? 

 Is it possible to indicate the race of which the peculiar form of skull before us 

 is the cranial type ? Following the method of exclusion, the only philosophi- 

 cal method available in researches of this kind, where the positive criteria or 

 data for determining a diagnosis are wanting, I have already shown that we 

 can safely affirm that the skull in question is neither Jewish, Arabian, Egyp- 

 tian ancient or modern, nor Turkish. With equal safety we may say that it 

 is not Roman in its origin or affiliation. For Blumenbach figures the skull of 

 a Roman praatorian soldier (Tab. 32) given to him by the Cardinal Borgia. 

 The configuration of this skulls differs from the Jerusalem fragment. " Pro- 

 tuberantia occipitalis externa latissima et ingenter eminens " are the words 

 employed by Blumenbach in describing the hind head of the former. Both 

 Sandifort* and Martinf speak of the broad forehead of the Roman skull, and 

 Retzius,J in describing such a skull found in an ancient cemetry at York, also 

 alludes to the ' ' broad and well arched forehead, and the broad, rounded oc- 

 ciput and prominent occipital protuberance," features not found in the Jeru- 

 salem fragment. Finally Dr. Thurnam, in his description of the skull of Theo- 

 dorianus, found in a Roman sarcophagus at York, (the ancient Eburacum,) tells 

 us that ' ' the forehead, though low, is remarkable f >r breadth ; that the coronal 

 surface presents an oval outline, and is notable for its great transverse diame- 

 ter : and that the occipital bone is full and prominent, especially in its upper 

 half. None of these characters are exhibited by the fragment before us. 



Is this fragment a Persian head ? In the Persian skull figured in Tab. 35 

 of Blumenbach's Decades the occiput is truncated or perpendicularly flattened. 

 In this respect it resembles the Jerusalem fragment. But when we turn to 

 the Persian heads in the Academy's collection we find that they present a 

 rounded occiput. Here then a difficulty occurs at once, as to the normal 

 occipital form of the Persian head. Is there one form which is constant and 

 typical or not ? From a general survey of the configuration of the occiput in 

 the various races of men, I am constrained to answer this question in the 

 negative. Only by means of a very large number of native Persian crania can 

 we determine this point. The flatness of the occiput in Blumenbach's Persian 

 skull may or may not be an accidental and unusual feature. Whether it is 

 or not there are differences between the two skulls now under consideration 

 sufficient to assign them to different races. In the Jerusalem skull the whole 

 hind-head is so flattened that it extends but a short distance behind the

meatus. In the cranium figured by Blumenbach only the extreme portion of the 

 occipital region is flattened, and there is much more of the head projecting back 

 of the bony meatus. We may conclude, therefore, that the fragment does not 

 belong to the Persic type. 



Of the cranial characteristics of some of the races mentioned in the 2d 

 chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, I have not been able to find any record 

 whateyer. The materials, therefore, for determining positively, by the method 

 of exclusion, the race to which our Jerusalem fragment belongs do not exist. 

 The various races of men occupying from the earliest times the ancient Ionia 

 or Asia Minor and the table lands of Persia and Armenia, constituted a very 

 heterogeneous population, in which Cushite, Shemitic, Arian and Turanian 

 ethnic elements appear to be inextricably blended. Much uncertainty pre- 

 vails among ethnographers as to the distinctive physical characters of these 

 different races. The national types of the Medes and Parthians are not cer- 

 tainly known. These people are generally ranked among the Turanians, 

 Scythians, or Turk-Tartars ; while the Persians, by nearly all chronologists 

 and philologists are looked upon as true Japetidse. Mesopotamia appears to 

 have been occupied from the remotest epoch by both Shemitic and Arian races. 

 Renan, guided by philological data, considers the bulk of the population to 

 be Shemitic* To the Elamites Polybius and Strabo ascribe a northern origin. 

 Josephus considers them to be the," ancestors of the Persians." Certainly in 

 the first Maccabees, Persia and Persepolis are both called Elam. Lenormant, 

 Quatremere, Movers and others consider the Elamites to be a people cognate 

 if not identical with the Persians. On the other hand Lowensternf thinks tha' 

 the primitive Elamites were of Shemitic origin, and that in more recent times 

 their ethnic characters were altered by intermixture with Scythic conquerors. 

 It matters not which of these two theories we adopt. For as the Barclay skull 

 differs from both Persian and Shemitic crania, it follows that in all probability 

 it differs equally from the Elamitic skull. 



The natives of Pontus were the Tibareni and affiliated tribes on the south- 

 east of the Black Sea in the neighborhood of Colchis. The Tibarenians of 

 Herodotus, according to Dubois, J are the Georgians of the present day. If so, 

 the Jerusalem skull never belonged to a " native of Pontus." 



If the Guanche skull in the collection represents truly the form of the 

 Libyan or Berber head, the Jerusalem cranium cannot be considered as a speci- 

 men of that race ; for the skull of the Guanche is a long oval, terminated 

 posteriorly by a protuberant occiput. In the Museum of the ' ' Carolinischen 

 Institut " at Stockholm, there are four Guanche skulls, which Prof. Retzius 

 speaks of as " grosse, geranmige, ovale Schiidel, sehr denen der Araber 

 gleichend." In the anatomical Museum " de lEcole de Mt-decine de Paris" 

 there is a skull of a Kabyle woman. From the reference made to it by Br. 

 Gosse it appears to be a long, narrow skull. According to Furnari, however, 

 the Berber cranium is " globuleux et conique en arriere."|| 



According to Klaproth the Parthians were cognate with the Getae, Massagetac, 

 and other tribes generally included by the ancient writers under the vague 

 and comprehensive term Scythian.^ Strabo calls them Carduchi, i. e. in- 

 habitants of Curdistan. Pulszky says, "The Parthians were probably not 

 Persians proper, but an unartistical Turanian tribe, held in subjection by the 

 earlier Persians under their Achaemenian kings, which, in its turn, revolting

from the yoke, ruled the Persians above four centuries."* Judging from the 

 portraits of the 1st, 5th, 12th and 19th Arsaces, on their silver coins in the 

 British Museum, the form of the Parthian skull must have been round or 

 globular, f 



Herodotus and Eudoxus, among the ancients, and Renan, % Gosche, Knobelli 

 and others, among the moderns, consider the Phrygians to be closely affiliated 

 to the Armenians. This opinion is based upon purely linguistic considerations. 

 There are reasons, however, for thinking that these two people were not cranio- 

 graphically alike. Both Potocki and Dubois regarded the Phrygians as of Ger- 

 jnanic origin. Hamilton Smith also speaks of them as a Getic clan. Among the 

 five characteristic types of man exhibited in the bas-reliefs on the tomb of King 

 Darius Hystaspes, excavated in the mountain Rachmend near Persepolis, there 

 is a Lydian wearing a Phrygian cap, and "representing the mixed population of 

 Asia Minor a modification of the Arian type by the infusion of foreign blood 

 Iranian, Scythian and Shemitish interminglings.^" The head is short and 

 rounded. This is true also of a head of a Lycaonian warrior from a monu- 

 ment of Iconium, in the south-western part of ancient Phrygia. Renan, 

 Movers and Knobel seem inclined to think that the ancient inhabitants of 

 Pamphylia were of Phoenician origin. But the Phoenician, like the Shemitic 

 skull, is dolicho-kephalic. Hence if the opinion of these gentlemen be well 

 grounded, the short-headed Jerusalem fragment is not Pamphylian. 



From these statements it will be seen that the Parthians, Phrygians, and 

 perhaps also the Cappadocians and Cretans belong, in common with the Scla- 

 vonians, Finns, Turks, Kalmucks, &c, to the same short-headed group of 

 crania to which must be assigned our Jerusalem skull. Of the exact form of 

 their heads, however, lean obtain no satisfactory information. The affilia- 

 tions of the Jerusalem skull must be sought in this direction. But the attempt 

 to determine its exact place in the ethnographic scale is still further compli- 

 cated by the question of deformation. Is it a deformed skull ? It is not easy 

 to answer this question positively. Deformed or distorted skulls are referrible, 

 as regards the cause of distortion, to three classes, viz : 1st. Skulls artificially 

 deformed by bandages, &c; 2d. Skulls posthumously distorted in consequence 

 of interstitial changes produced by the combined influence of pressure and 

 moisture ; and 3d. Skulls naturally or congenitally deformed in consequence 

 of obliteration by synostosis of some one of the sutures, this obliteration taking 

 place during intra-uterine or early extra-uterine life and by presenting a point 

 of resistance, causing the brain and with it the calvarial bones to be un- 

 duly developed in certain directions, as has been very clearly shown by Dr. 

 Humphry Minchin, of Dublin.** Now a careful inspection of the Jerusalem 

 skull shows that no synostosis either of the lambdoidal or the posterior part of 

 the sagittal suture can be pointed out. The occipital and parietal bones have 

 been developed in the usual manner and from ossific points of ordinary num- 

 ber and location. The sutures mentioned though nearly consolidated have 

 not been obliterated. The deformation is, therefore, not congenital. It is not 

 posthumous, for if it were, the sutures would in all probability gap, and not 

 admit of coaptation, and the head would be asymmetrical. We may conclude 

 then that the head has been artificially deformed, by pressure strongly, evenly

and continuously applied to the occipital region during growth. Formerly the 

 custom of distorting the head was supposed to be confined to the American abo- 

 rigines. It is now known to have prevailed in various parts of the old world as 

 well as in the new. The Jerusalem skull is a strongly marked, perhaps I may 

 say, an exaggerated example of the Tste deprimee par de'rridre, of Dr. Gosse, of 

 Geneva. This excellent craniographer divides all artificially deformed skulls 

 into sixteen classes. In the fifteenth he places occipitally flattened crania. 

 Besides the Peruvian and other aboriginal Americans, the Tahitians, accord- 

 ing to Ellis,* and the natives of the Nicobar Isles, according to Nicolas Fon- 

 tana,f were in the habit of flattening the heads of their children in this 

 manner. Insfeld, cited by Soemmering, t says of the Kalmucks, "quadratum 

 formam appetunt. " We learn from Vesalius that occipital deformation was 

 practiced in his time by certain German tribes. " Germani, " he writes, ' ' vero 

 compresso plerumque occipite et lato capite spectantur, quod pueri in cunis 

 dorso semper incumbant, ac manibus fere citra fasciarum usum, cunarum 

 lateribus utrinque alliguntur." Hence, the term tete carree applied to. the 

 Germans. Vesalius also writes of the Tnrks : "Turcarum capite globi fere 

 iniaginem exprimunt, ad hanc quoque obstetricibus nonnunquam magna ma- 

 trum sollicitudine opem ferentibus." The Tahitian and Nicobarian crania 

 being dolichokephalic, we may, on this account, as well as for obvious geo- 

 graphical reasons, set them aside, as we have already the Turks, in our at- 

 tempts to determine the nationality of the Jerusalem skull. We thus limit 

 ourselves to a choice between the Mongols, Germans, Peruvians, and, for rea- 

 sons presently to be stated, the Sclavonians, and a certain brachykephalic 

 race, cranial specimens of which have been found in the Catacombs of Paris, 

 by the late Dr. Harlan, and placed in the Academy's collection by his son. 

 One of the latter, No. 664, bears much resemblance to the Barclay skull. The 

 two, however, are by no means, identical in form. For the forehead in No. 

 664 is broader in proportion to the bind-head than in the Jerusalem skull ; the 

 crown in the former is consequently less triangular, and the occiput, though 

 flattened in the same way, is not so decidedly and broadly flattened. The 

 crown of our Jerusalem fragment more closely resembles that of a Sclavonian 

 head from Olmutz, No. 1251 of the collection. The calvaria in both is trian- 

 gular in shape, but more elevated at the junction of the sagittal and coronal 

 sutures in the Sclavonian than in the skull from Palestine. The occipital region 

 in the latter is globular, and has not been subjected to the flattening process. 

 Nevertheless, if it had been vertically flattened by art, we can weli imagine 

 that it would have strikingly resembled the Jerusalem skull. The Sclavic 

 skull from Morlack, in Dalmatia, exhibits an oblong coronal region. The 

 shape of the crown in the short-headed German type (such as seen in Nos. 37 

 and 1063) is a rounded square. In the German head, No. 706, the crown is 

 triangular, but that part at the junction of the sagittal and coronal su- 

 tures, is very much arched, and in this respect is unlike the Jerusalem frag- 

 ment. In the long-headed Germans the crown forms a broad oval. The Jeru- 

 salem skull very closely resembles the cast of a Burat Mongol head, No. 1355 

 of the collection. It also resembles the Kalmuck skull, No.1553, though less 

 decidedly. In the brachykephalic Burat head there is the same triangular 

 crown, narrow ' at the forehead and broad between the parietal bosses ; the 

 same moderate fulness of the centre of the dome, and the same symmetry. 

 Had the occiput been flattened the forms of the two crania would have been 

 identical. As it is, the occipital region projects but a short distance behind 

 the foramen magnum, so that very little compression would be necessary to

-74 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



give to it the occipital form of the skull from Jerusalem. The absence of th 

 truncated occiput in the only specimen of the Burat type in the collection need 

 not deter us from referring the Barclay fragment to this type. I have already 

 noticed the fact that the Kalmucks were in the habit of giving a square form to 

 The head. This practice was confined to male children. Females were for the 

 most part exempt from it, and consequently retained the form of head given 

 to them by nature. It is curious to observe that the Burat cast has every ap- 

 pearance of being the cast of a female skull of one, therefore, which has 

 escaped compression. As if to confirm the reference here made of the Jeru- 

 salem skull to the Burat cranial type, I may say, that after the above lines 

 had been written, I received a copy of Dr. Latham's " Descriptive 

 Rthnology, " published during the current year. In the first volume, when 

 describing the Mongolian physiognomy, he alludes to my description of the 

 only Kalmuck skull in tbe Academy's collection, and quoting Blumenbach's 

 epithets, says that the cranial collection in the Berlin Museum, the largest he 

 has seen, verifies these epithets. He says farther, that " the base of some of 

 the Burat crania, and the truncation of the occiput, are in some cases inordinate.' : ' 

 (p. 339.) I find additional confirmation of the ideas here advocated in a pos- 

 teriorly flattened skull brought to the Academy, within a few days past, by Mr. 

 J. H. Slack, who informs me that it belonged to the collection of Prof. Wein- 

 land, and was found upon the battle- field of Balaklava. Though labelled 

 Cossack, it is undoubtedly of Mongolian origin. In many respects it is analo- 

 gous to the Kalmuck skull No. 1553 of the collection, but unlike this latter it 

 has the occiput flattened. The Cossacks, it will be remembered, are a mixed 

 people, made up chiefly of Sclavonians, Turks and Mongols, the latter ethnh 

 element predominating. 



The Jerusalem skull resembles Nos. 85, 87, 450, 688, 752, 1232, 1458, 1459, 

 1464, 1473, 1481, 1493, 1495, 1504, 1509, 230, 497, and others of the Peruvian 

 group. The former is, however, not identical in conformation with the latter. 

 Nearly all these Peruvian skulls are irregularly distorted, and in most of them 

 the sinciput appears to have been compressed as well as the occiput. Although 

 distorted by -the same means, and in general outline very much alike, yet 

 they differ to some extent from each other in the shape of the crown, and even 

 in' the extent and direction of the occipital flatness. Except in the fact that 

 the Burat and Kalmuck skulls are not artificially flattened as the Barclay 

 cranium has evidently been, these three resemble each other more closely 

 than the latter does the Peruvian. Nevertheless, the short-headed and occi- 

 pitally flattened Peruvian skulls and our Jerusalem fragment are referrible 

 to, the same type, or at least to types so closely related that it requires careful 

 examination to discriminate between them. Are we justified on this account 

 in regarding the cranium from Jerusalem as a Peruvian skull? I think not. 

 To refer a skull to its formal type is not the same as referring it to its appro- 

 priate race, nation or tribe. Two skulls of the same type may belong to very 

 different races. This fact is involved in a curious law of homoiokephalio re- 

 presentation, which has been entirely overlooked by craniographers, and the 

 neglect of which has in several instances, led to very curious mistakes. The 

 ancient Avarian skull found at G-rafonegg, in Austria, by Count Von Brauner, 

 so closely resembled some of the elongated and cylindrically compressed Peru- 

 vian skulls, that Von Tschudi declared it to be of Peruvian origin, and sup- 

 posed that it had been brought over from Peru to Austria with other collections. 

 Prof. Retzius, with greater diagnostic skill, pointed out certain differential 

 characters which were overlooked or regarded as of no importance by Von 

 Tschudi, and pronounced the skull to be indigenous to Europe and to have 

 belonged to the Avarians. This opinion, which at first gained no support, 

 was afterwards proven to be correct by the discovery of similar skulls at 

 . Atsgersdorf, near Vienna, in Austria, at the village of St. Romain in Savoy, 

 and in the valley of the Doubs, not far from Mandeuse. Fitzinger, Troyon, 



[Sept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 275 



(losse and Duvernoy examined these crania and e mfirmed the opinion of 



Retzius. The first mentioned observer has shown that they resemble in every 

 particular certain crania found in the Crimea and described by Rathke and 

 Meyer.* To refer the Barclay fragment to the Peruvian race would he to re- 

 peat the mistake of Von Tschudi. 



Thus, then, from the foregoing details we may conclude quite posi- 

 tively that the skull found by Mr. Barclay is neither that of a Jew, Arab, 

 Egyptian, Fellah, Turk, Roman, Persian, Elamite, Tibarenian nor Libyan. 

 Reasons have also been adduced opposing the ascription to it of a Peruvian 

 origin. 



It may have belonged to the Parthians, Phrygians, Mesopotamians, Cap- 

 padocians or Cretans, in so far as these are representatives of the so-called 

 Turanian type. The craniographic data necessary to determine this point 

 satisfactorily are almost entirely wanting. 



It is, in all probability, either a Mongolian or a Sclavonian skull. In som 

 respects it resembles both, in some respects it differs from both. Hence the 

 difficulty of determining between the two, a difficulty increased by the fact 

 that these two cranial forms or types are themselves closely related, and pos- 

 sess features in common, and that the differential characters by which they 

 are distinguished reside chiefly in the facial and basal bones, parts which are 

 wanting in the Jerusalem fragment. The latter, however, as we have seen, 

 resembles more closely the Burat cranial form than that of the Moravian variety 

 of the Sclavic. It resembles the former more strikingly perhaps than any 

 other head in the collection that has not been deformed. Still it may approx- 

 imate just as closely the head of a Tschek, Wend, Slovack, Croat, Serbian, 

 Pole or any other representative of the great Sarmatian stock. I cannot make 

 the necessary comparisons to determine this point, for the Academy's collection 

 contains no specimens of these transitionary races. I say transitionary, for 

 through these Sclavonian tribes the brachykephalse of Europe graduate into 

 the brachykephalse of Asia. To be more precise, I may say, indeed, that an 

 attentive consideration of the Burat skull type leads me to the belief that the 

 short- headed races of Eastern Europe graduate into the Kalmucks and Mongols 

 proper of Asia through the Sclaves and Burats of Lake Baikal. The latter 

 people, judging from the cast in the Academy's collection, belong to a typ 

 somewhat higher in the human cranial scale than the Mongolian. According 

 to Tchihatcheff, they manifest more aptitude for civilization than the purt* 

 Mongolian tribes. 



The type of the Burat head being displayed in the fragment from Jeru- 

 salem, I refer the latter provisionally to the people and the region about Lake 

 Baikal. 



This opinion is announced not as a positive and indisputable conclusion, 

 but as an approximation to the truth, an approximation, moreover, whoso 

 scientific value is necessarily as incomplete as the facts upon which it is based 

 are limited. 



From the foregoing remarks it will be seen that neither occipital nor calva- 

 rial characters per se, are as valuable as is generally thought by craniographerti 

 in determining the race to which any particular skull belongs. In like man- 

 ner basal, facial or lateral characters, taken singly, will not be sufficient to de- 

 termine the type of a skull. This type is found neither in the base, nor in 

 the dome, neither in the occiput nor the sinciput alone. To a great extent it 

 resides in the sutures, and is determined partly by the number and location 

 of the ossific centres, and the rapidity with which development proceeds from 

 such foci, and partly by the extent and direction of this development. During

the centuries that have elapsed, since man first appeared upon the surface of 

 the earth, the ethnical peculiarities which appear to have originally charac- 

 terised the laws of cranial development in the different races of men, have 

 become so masked or modified by hybrid interminglings of varied degree 

 and kind, that the great principle of the correlation of forms is scarcely availa- 

 ble in inferring from one or more fragments of a skull the typical form of that 

 skull. Cuvier, the discoverer of this important principle of palaeontology, 

 regarded every organized being as a whole, whose different parts correspond to 

 each other in such a manner that none can change without the others changing 

 also. Consequently, to him not only each part, but each fragment of apart, ap- 

 peared to be the index of all the others. He asserted that not only the class, 

 but the order, the genus, and even the species are expressed in the form of each 

 part, in the smallest apophysis, the smallest bony facet. Guided by this teleo- 

 iogical principle, the sagacious Cuvier, from the examination of a single tooth, 

 was enabled to announce the character of the entire skeleton of an extinct reptile. 

 The jaw bone and teeth of an extinct species of animal then unknown (Phascolo- 

 Iherium Bucklandii) he correctly ascribed to a marsupial quadruped allied to the 

 opossum. In like manner the fragment of a fossil femur, found in New Zealand, 

 was referred by Prof. Owen to an extinct genus of tridactyle Struthious birds. 

 The correctness of this reference was afterwards attested by the discovery of 

 numerous remains of several species of this genus. So also, Prof. Leidy, fol- 

 lowing the same great law of the harmonization of forms, was enabled to as- 

 sign the fragment of a fossil molar tooth, from Missouri Territory, to a species 

 of rhinoceros. Subsequently, he received from the same place fragments of 

 the maxillae and cranium of this species sufficient to confirm positively his 

 opinion. Still more recently he referred a fragment of the anterior portion of 

 a fossil upper jaw, from the valley of the Niobrara river, to a species of camel, 

 and this reference was confirmed by the discovery of an entire jaw of the ani- 

 mal bearing the peculiar hook-like process, which differentiates it from all 

 other ruminants. 



But, though the palaeontologist and comparative anatomist can, from minute 

 fragments of bone, reconstruct many of the extraordinary species of animals 

 that flourished in earlier geological epochs, yet the student of human cranio- 

 graphy can seldom, with any certainty, indicate from a fragment the type and 

 race of a skull. The palaeontologist is assisted to his conclusions by the law 

 of co-existing elements or harmony of forms, and when this fails, as it does 

 at times, and as it occasionally did even in the hands of its illustrious dis- 

 coverer, he can resort to the comparison of the fossil remains he may be study- 

 ing with the similar parts of animals now existing. The craniographer cannot 

 avail himself of this law of correlation. The existence of numerous transi- 

 tionary forms, partly natural, partly hybrid, occupying places between the 

 leading, typical stocks, and causing these latter to graduate into each other, 

 in some instances almost insensibly ; the difficulty of distinguishing between 

 natural and hybrid sub-types ; the existence of artificially deformed crania 

 among different races in both hemispheres, some of them being purely arbi- 

 trary or conventional, and some of them imitations of natural but little known 

 forms, all constitute serious obstacles to the practical application of this law 

 to human crania. A still greater difficulty, moreover, is found in the fact 

 that, in its practical working, this law is seen to be more generic than specific. 

 In other words it differentiates genera better than species ; species better than 

 varieties. With the latter, though theoretically true, it is practically valueless. 

 Cuvier himself was unable to point out specific osteological differences between 

 the lion and tiger, the horse and ass, the dog and wolf, the leopard, panther, wild 

 and domestio cats, &c. Pie was unable, consequently, to satisfy himself of the 

 precise organic form or specific type to which the fossil representatives of these 

 species belonged. Even, in regard to living species, Cuvier acknowledged that 

 " La classe des poissons est de toutes, celle qui offre le plus de difficultils quand 



[Sept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 277 



onveutlasubdiviserenordresd'apresdescaracteresfixesetsensibles.''* Never- 

 theless, it is well known that Agassiz, abandoning the Cuvierian method of com- 

 paring animals by their organs, and adopting Bichat's scheme of comparing the 

 tissues of oryans instead, was enabled to reconstruct the fishes of tbe fossil 

 world by noting carefully the characteristics of their tegumentary membrane. 

 If it be true, indeed, for the animal world at large, as maintained by Knox, 

 that specific characters are in the main external ; and that the anatomy of the 

 interior leads to higher considerations than the mere determination of species ; 

 and if it be true, that, on this account, the law of correlation so often fails in 

 its application to species, still more should it fail when used as a means of 

 diagnosticating human crania from each other. For a serial unity of form is 

 here more manifest than in the animal "world proper, and this unity has 

 become still more apparent under the combined influence of civilization and 

 hybridity. In long periods of time civilization appears to be capable of 

 modifying human cranial forms to a slight though appreciable extent. Hy- 

 bridity, by introducing intermediate or transitionary forms, gives to osteological 

 characters, originally differential, an uncertain or fluctuating value. Natural- 

 ists are not agreed whether the carnivora of the fossil world were identical 

 with the lions, tigers, panthers, leopards, &c, of the present time, or were 

 specifically distinct from these. They are not yet decided whether all the 

 species of the present fauna of this continent are distinct from those found 

 fossil in the post-pliocene deposits of South Carolina or not. They find that 

 the teeth and bones of the living rabbit, raccoon, opossum, deer, elk, hog, 

 dog, sheep, ox and horse, cannot be distinguished anatomically from similar 

 remains found in these deposits, and they are consequently at a loss whether 

 to regard the former as the direct descendants of the latter, or entirely distinct 

 from them ; and this, too, notwithstanding that the fossil specimens are found 

 associated with the remains of animals positively known to be extinct, such 

 as mastodon, megatherium, hipparion, &c.f They are not agreed whether the 

 fossil horse resembled the quagga, the zebra, the dzigguetai, the domestic 

 horse, or an animal wholly and specifically distinct from all these. Agassiz 

 "entertains doubts respecting the unity of origin of the domesticated horse. "j 

 According to Knox, the fossil horse belongs to no species of this animal now 

 living. Prof. Owen finding that one of the teeth of a certain fossil horse is 

 6omeWhat more curved than the corresponding tooth of the recent horse, 

 declares the former to be a distinct species, and names it Equus curvidens. 

 Prof. Leidy is persuaded that many remains of an extinct species of horse, 

 from the post-pliocene of this country, are undistinguishable from the recent 

 one. The specimens of teeth of this animal, which he has had the oppor- 

 tunity of exhibiting, present so much difference in condition of preservation 

 or change in structure ; so much variation in size, from that of the more 

 ordinary horse to the largest English dray horse ; and so much variableness 

 in constitution, from that of the recent horse to the most complex condition 

 belonging to any extinct, species described, that it would be about as easy, he 

 thin ! s, to indicate a h If dozen species as it would two. || So it is with the varied 

 cranial forms displayed in the great natural family man. Of human crania, it 

 is just as easy, indeed, I think it is easier to make twenty-seven races, types, 

 permanent varieties, or species call them what you will as it is to make 

 any less number so very mobile, so very elastic is the fundamental plan or 

 structural type of the human skull. The uncertainty which surrounds the 

 definition of the species of the genus Equus, exists also in connection with the

genera bos, ovis, capra, ursus, canis, felis, sua, and other extant natural 

 families, repr sentative remains of which- have been found in strata apper- 

 taining to geological epochs anterior to our own. Difference of species for Ursus 

 maritimuS and Ursus Americanus could not be predicated upon tbe skulls 

 only of these animals. The crania of Felis canadensis, F. concolor, F. chaly- 

 beata, &c, in the Museum of the Academy, are identical in form and dentition 

 with the skull of F. tigris. So, also, the skulls of Canis lupus, and C. familiaris 

 are identical with each other. I doubt if there is the anatomist living who 

 from the study of one or several bones of the head of one of the above 

 mentioned species, could unerringly refer them to their proper species. 

 Still less, if the animal were extinct, could they restore the species. To their 

 appropriate genus these bones might be restored, and this genus might 

 be reconstructed, but nothing more. So, also, supposing the Jew, the 

 Gipsey, and the Eskimo, all long-headed people, were extinct, I feel very cer- 

 tain that no ethnologist could, from their crania alone, restore the distinctive, 

 ethnic features of these people, the prominent, unmistakable nose and mouth 

 of the first, the long, dark and squinting eyes, and narrow radix nasi of the 

 second, the stunted form and flat,, lozenge-face of the last. On the other hand 

 suppose the Finn, the Lapp, the Turk and the Sclav, all long-headed people, 

 were among the past and gone. Then the problem would be, if anything, still 

 more difficult. For these crania resemble each other much more closely than 

 do those of the Eskimo, Gipsey and Jew. If we were to contrast the skull of 

 an Eskimo with that of a Sclav or a Turk, or thesku'l of a Gipsey or Jew with 

 that of a Finn or Lapp we should soon discover that there were greater differ- 

 ences between the crania thus compared, than between the different species 

 of Ursus, or of Canis, or of Felis. The most striking difference is to be found 

 ;n the length or antero-posterior dimensions of the two classes of skulls. Upon 

 this feature, indeed, Retzius has founded his two groups of human crania 

 the dolichokephalic and brachykephalic. But this difference in length is ac- 

 companied by other characters, some of which though less striking to the 

 ordinary observer, are not the less valuable and distinctive, in an ethnical 

 point of view. If all skulls were either long or short the craniographer might 

 readily refer any particular skull submitted to his inspection to one or other 

 of these two classes. But there are many crania which are shorter than the 

 so-called " long skulls," and yet longer than the so-called "short skulls." 

 These constitute a class intermediate between the dolichokephala? and brachy- 

 kephala?, into which they graduate on either hand so insensibly that they are 

 separable from them by no trenchant lines. A skull having been placed 

 among the dolichokephalae, or it may be among the brachykephalse, it is still 

 as far from being minutely classified as the head of a dog which has been 

 located in a group called simply "Canis." It may be orthognathic or prog- 

 nathic, it may be square-, oblong-, oval-, or lozenge-faced ; it may have an oval, 

 triangular or square crown. In many skulls these features may be, and, in- 

 deed, are, variously combined. Individual crania of the same group not 

 unfrequently exhibit these features differently combined. On the other hand 

 two skulls closely resembling each other may belong to distinct races differing 

 in general appearance, in language, in habits, in intellectual and instinctive 

 traits. Contrast, for example, the skull of a Graeco-Egyptian, No. 837 of the 

 collection, with that of an ancient Swede, No. 1249. These heads differ no 

 more from each other, than they respectively do from the other specimens of 

 the groups to which they severally belong. Upon our side of the Atlantio the 

 Swedsh crania find their representatives in the Arickaree Indian skulls. 



The Academy's collection furnishes other examples of this seeming paradox ; 

 some of them exhibited by races which occupy widely separated localities, 

 and of the assumed community of origin of which there is not only no scien- 

 tific proof of a positive oharacter, but even no presumptive testimony that is 

 reliable. The recognition of such facts led me, more than two years ago, to 



[Sept,

oppress my conviction that strong resemblances between human cranial types 

 do not infallibly indicate a common parentage, such resemblances merely 

 manifesting similarity of positional the human series.* Human osteology, 

 however, is not peculiar in this respect. Prof. Agassiz thinks that the circum- 

 stances under which were found the fossil remains obtained by Prof. Holmes 

 from the post-pliocene or post-tertiary beds of South Carolina, " show beyond 

 the possibility of a controversy," I am using his own strong language, 

 "that animals which cannot be distinguished from one another, may originate 

 independently in different fauna. "f It will thus be seen that in many in- 

 stances to refer a skull to its appropriate formal type is one thing ; to 

 refer it to its proper race, quite another. An obscure system of homoioke- 

 phalic representation seems to prevail among the races of men, in virtue of 

 which the cranial type of one race repeats itself among another people, very 

 distant from, and unknown to the first. Hence the law of cranial correlations 

 is, to a certain extent, obscured, and its utility in identifying and classifying 

 human skulls very much impaired. But the great difficulty after all with the 

 craniographer is to fix upon characters which are at once definitive, differen- 

 tial and constant, and therefore typical beyond all doubt or cavil. The skulls 

 of the orthognathic Greek, and the prognathic Saharan Negro differ more from 

 each other than do those of the nandu and ostrich, those of the llama and 

 eamel, or those of the genera Tarandus, Alces, Cervus, Panolia, Axis, Caria- 

 cas, Blastocerus, Capreolus and Cervulus into which naturalists divide the 

 Oervidse. But the negro differs cranially as much from the Eskimo, the Phoe- 

 nician and the Malay as from the Greek. Yet the Eskimo, the Phoenician 

 and the Malay, like the woolly-haired typical African, are all prognathic. The 

 prognathism of the one, however, differs in kind from that of each of the 

 others. Here, then, are differences which, though minute, serve to alter the 

 entire physiognomical expression of a skull, and so affect not only its classifi- 

 cation but its identity also. When we compare together extreme crania, 

 without reference to intervening forms,, these differences are seen to be differ- 

 ences of kind. But as soon as we take into' comparison the transitionary 

 cranial forms or types, which fill up the space or gap between these extremes, 

 then these differences become differences of degree rather than of kind. 



The same uncertainty characterises the species of many genera of birds, 

 reptiles, shells, plants, &c. Dr. Adam Smith placed in a row all the known 

 species of the natural family of the Alcaudae, and in presence of such an ordeal, 

 all the pretended specific external characters of naturalists completely broke 

 down. Dr. Knox dissected the serpents of South Africa, and divided them, 

 according to the dentition, into those with poison fangs, and those without. 

 This he regarded as a scientific distinction. But when he began to dissect the 

 serpents of the globe and not those of any particular region he quickly found , 

 that the distinction was invalid. That certain species of insects carry poisonous 

 fangs only on the upper maxillary bones is true ; but as there are many 

 which carry also harmless teeth on the same bones, the fact becomes of 

 little or no value scientifically or practically, t It is needless to multiply proof 

 in this direction. Indeed it seems to be a general fact that just in proportion 

 as the species of a genus become more and more numerous, their differential 

 characters become more and more confused and uncertain, and the species 

 when ranged side by side are seen to blend with or pass into each other in 

 obedience to a great, fundamental law of gradation through which their true 

 structural unity finds its only expression. Viewing the facts of specific differ- 

 ences in this comprehensive way, and bearing in mind that the question of

origin or parentage is not necessarily connected with that of cranial iorms, if 

 is evident that if we accept for man the recognised principles of zoological 

 classification, we must regard the human family as a genus represented by nu- 

 merous species, whose differential characters touch, so to speak, or even over- 

 lap each other. There is undoubtedly a serial unity of all human crania. 

 There is, in other words, a human cranial type the type of a natural class or 

 family widely separated from the most anthropomorphous apes a type sus- 

 ceptible of very numerous, but individually limited, modifications, the result 

 of climatic conditions, and persisting as long as the conditions which bring 

 them into existence continue ; a type susceptible, also, of hybrid modifications, 

 which though ephemeral and not self-sustaining as are the great stocks, are 

 transitionary and therefore valuable as showing all the possible variations of 

 the primal or central form. All these variations tend constantly to assume^ 

 the normal type, to assume it indirectly or spirally, as it were, so that the ex- 

 tremest departure from the type is bound to the latter through graduated 

 forms, in such a manner that when the extremes of the series are compared 

 together with reference to these forms, it is difficult to point out the constant 

 and unvarying differential characters.

Steilacoom, Dr. Suckley, one specimen. Resembles A. aurorata, and in 

 the absence of a specimen for comparison, was incorrectly referred by me to 

 that species (P. R. R. Expl.. xi. 18,) ; it is, however, less elongated, with the 

 posterior angles of the thorax not divergent, and the tarsal grooves on the 

 under surface of the prothorax are much less apparent.

Punto de los Reyes, Mr. Davidson, to whom I take great pleasure in dedi- 

 cating this fine species. It differs from those previously described by the 

 strongly serrate antennae ; these organs are half the length of the body in the 

 female, and a little longer in the male ; the second joint is small, the third, 

 fourth and fifth are triangular, and nearly as wide as long ; the following ones 

 gradually diminish in breadth ; the eleventh is oval elongate and constricted 

 at the end. The last segment of the abdomen is marked towards the base 

 with a semicircular impression, with the concavity behind, as though it wert- 

 formed by the union of two segments.

284 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



One specimen, Punto de los Reyes, Mr. Davidson. The first example of the 

 occurrence of the genus upon this continent. The head is slightly wider than 

 the thorax : the latter is feebly sinuate on the sides behind, the elytra are 

 tnore distinctly green, they are twice as long as the head and thorax united, 

 and nearly cover the abdomen, which is subacute at tip. The antennae 

 are half as long as the body, with the second joint a little shorter than the 

 third. 



Anobium gi bbic olle, fuscum, pube subtilissima sericans, valde elonga- 

 tum, thorace latitudine fere sesqui longiore, antice angustatum, lateribus sin- 

 uatis, apice basique rotundato, medio utrinque ad latera oblique profunde 

 impresso, disco postice melio valde elevato, ad angulos posticos profnnde im- 

 presso, angulis rotundatis marginatis, elytris, thorace latioribus striis puncta- 

 tis interstitiis paulo convexis. Long. '22. 



One specimen, Punto de los Reyes : Mr. Davidson. Belongs to the division 

 having 11-jointed antennse : the joints 4-8 are very small ; the 3d is a little 

 longer ; the 2d is longer and thicker, though not as large as the basal joint : 

 the 9th, 10th and 11th are equal, narrow, and each one is as long as the joint 

 3-8 together. The body is still narrower than in A. foveatum Kirby, and 

 the posterior angles of the thorax are rounded : the sides near the anterior 

 angles are emarginate, so that the latter become distinct, though deflexed : the 

 eyes are small and convex, and the head is transversely impressed just behind 

 them. 



Anobium punctulatum, rufo-testaceum, cylindrico-ovale, pnbescens, 

 capite confertim punetato, thorace brevi aequaliter convexo, lateribus rotunda- 

 tis late marginatis, confertim punctulato, elytris thorace haud latioribus sat 

 dense punctulatis ; antennis articulis 3 ultimis singulatim prsecedentibus 

 duobus sequalibus. Long. -l^lS. 



Two specimens, Punto de los Reyes. Very similar to A. convexifrons 

 Mels. , but differs by the punctures of the elytra being less close. The antennae 

 as in it are 11-jointed : the joints 2, 4, 6 and 8 are a little shorter than the 

 others, the 9th, 10th and 11th are each equal to the 7th and 8th together. 



Helops op a c u s , apterus, ater opacus, capite thoraceque densissime punc- 

 tatis, hoc latitudine sesqui breviore, modice convexo, lateribus tenue margin-

One specimen, Sacramento, California, given me by Mr. Rathvon. The three 

 joints of the anterior and middle tarsi are densely hairy beneath, but scarcely 

 dilated. 



Hypulus fulminans, elongatus piceus, parce pubescens, sat dense pro- 

 funde punctatus, thorace latitudine haud breviore, lateribus rotundatis, angulis

 magna ante apicali pallidis, antennis fuscis basi testaceis, femoribus tibiisque 

 medio fuscis. Long. '21. 



Oregon. Mr. Davidson. This species so resembles in its characters Dircasa 

 Holmbergii Mann., Bull. Mosc, 1852, 347, that I cannot help suspecting 

 that they are identical. A renewed examination of Mannerheim's type would 

 be necessary, however, before such a suggestion could be admitted.

Punto de los Reyes, two specimens : Mr. Davidson. Narrower than N. 

 cavicornis, with the elytra only sparsely punctulate. The lateral spot of 

 the elytra is absent in one specimen. The margin of the horn has only two 

 or three indistinct serratures. 



Salpingus alternatus, aaneo-niger nitidus, capite thoraceque sat dense 

 punctatis, hoc ovato, latitudine paulo longiore, postice angustiore, vage inse-

Punto de los Reyes, one specimen. Of the same form and size as S. vires- 

 cens Zee, but with the striae of punctures of the elytra more plainly 

 marked, and without the interstitial rows of equally large punctures, which 

 are so obvious in that species. 



Cossonus scrobiculatus, niger nitidus, elongatus, rostro punctato, ad 

 apicem subito parum dilatato, capite fere laevi, thorace latitudine longiore, 

 autrorsum angustato, lateribus late rotundatis, rude punctato, dorso postice 

 paulo deplanato, medio subcarinato, elytris convexis, cylindricis, thorace 

 paulo latioribus, striis cribrosis, interstitiis striis haud latioribus. Long. -20. 



Punto de los Reyes, Mr. Davidson. The rostrum has an oblong impression 

 at the middle, and the front is marked with a small fovea. 



Hylesinus nebulosus, elongatus, piceo-niger opacus, setulis brevissimis 

 adspersus, capite confertim punctato, transversim biimpresso, thorace latitu- 

 dine paulo breviore, antrorsum sensim angustato, lateribus antice sinuatis, 

 apice late subtubulato, squamulis nigris obtecto, elytris thorace parum latiori-

Table Mountain, California, one specimen, Mr. Davidson. Very distinct from 

 any other that I have seen. 



Callidium infuscatum, elongatum, fusco-piceum parce pubescens, capite 

 dense punctulato, thorace latitudine paulo breviore, lateribus rotundatis, dense 

 punctato, linea dorsali laevi, elytris sat dense minus subtiliter punctatis, ab- 

 domine pedibusque testaceis. Long. -43. 



Punto de los Reyes. Similar to C. aereum Newman, but differs by the 

 head being finely punctured, the thorax more densely punctured, and by the 

 abdomen being testaceous. 



Brothylus conspersus, nigro-piceUs, pube brevi griseo-sordida densa 

 variegatus, thorace latitudine haud breviore, lateribus subrotundatis vix obsolete 

 tuberculatis, postice sinuatis, rude parce varioloso, cailo utrinque discoideo al- 

 teroque postico parvis, elytris thorace latioribus, granulis elevatis, punctisque 

 minus densis, postice sensim subtilioribus ; fasciis duabus/vagis obliquis minus 

 pubescentibus. Long. *73 -77. 



Oregon, Mr. Davidson and Dr. Kennerly. Similar toB. gemmulatus 

 Lee, Proc. Acad., 1859, 80, but differs by the lateral tubercles of the thorax 

 being obsolete. The antennas of the male are as long as the body, those of the 

 female one-fourth shorter. 



Chrysomela sigmoidea, nigro-aenea, oblongo-rotundata, thorace sat 

 dense, ad latera fortius punctato, elytris thorace parum latioribus albo-testacels, 

 sat dense punctatis, sutura, vitta confluente antice breviter discreta, vittis 

 duabus curvatis, interiore antice, exteriore postice abbreviatis, guttisque ex- 

 terms paucis nigro-aeneis. Long. *32. 



Oregon; a specimen kindly given me by Mr. Henry Ulke. More nearly 

 allied by its markings toC. dislocata Rogers than to any other of our 

 species, but differing by the much wider thorax, and more dense punctures 



1859.]

both of thorax and elytra, as well as by the markings of the latter. The inner 

 curved stripe extends from one-sixth from the base to one-third from the apex ; 

 the outer one is contiguous to it, connected with a humeral spot, and abbre- 

 viated behind at the middle. 



Haltica aeruginosa, oblongo-ovalis, modice convexa, obscure cuprea, 

 subnitida, thorace convexo, subtilissime punctulato, linea transversa postica 

 obsoleta, antrorsum subangustato, lateribus parum rotundatis, elytris thorace

Table Mountain, below San Francisco, Mr. Davidson : two specimens. These 

 three species belong to the division Grraptodera Chevr. 



Dibolia o v a t a , ovata, convexa, nigro-aenea, nitida, subtiliter punctulata, 

 elytris seriebus punctorum subtilibus postice haud distinctis, antennis nigris 

 basi testaceis, tibiis tarsisque anterioribus testaceis, femoribus obscuris. Long. 

 12. 



One specimen, Punto de los Reyes. The posterior thighs are black, and the 

 tibiae and tarsi dark brown. Broader and more ovate than D. aerea Mels., 

 with the rows of punctures of the elytra very fine, not impressed, and oblite- 

 rated behind. 



Luperus smaragdinus, elongatus, cyaneo-viridis, antennis nigris 

 basi fuscis, thorace convexo, quadrato, lateribus paulo rotundatis, anticis 

 prominulis rotundatis, parce subtiliter punctulato, elytris sat dense punctula- 

 tis. Long. -23. 



Punto de los Reyes, three specimens, Mr. Davidson. Resembles L. varipes 

 Lee. but differs by the entirely black legs, and by the thorax being much less 

 densely punctulate. The second and third joints of the antennae together are 

 equal to the fourth ; the third is one half longer than the second. 



Coccinella melanopleura, ovalis, modice convexa, capite thoraceque 

 haud dense punctulatis, illo maculis duabus albis, hoc limbo antico, lateribus 

 late (macula nigra inclusa) lineolaapicali, maculisque duabus basalibus albis, 

 scutello nigro, elytris ferrugineis, confertim subtiliter punctatis ; subtus nigra, 

 tibiis tarsisque fusco-testaceis. Long. - 21. 



Table Mountain, Mr. Davidson, one specimen. Closely resembles the varie- 

 ties of C. p i c t a, with immaculate el} r tra, but differs by the body being entirely 

 black beneath, and by the elytra being more finely punctured. It is probable 

 that varieties will occur with white thorax having black spots, and also with 

 elytral markings. 



Coccinella b a r d a , hemisphaerica, capite punctulato, albo, postice nigro, 

 thorace parce punctulato, nigro, macula magna utrinque, limboque antico 

 albis, elytris subtiliter dense punctatis, ferrugineis, fascia transversa communi 

 pone basin nigris, scutello, sutnraque ad basin nigris ; subtus nigra, epimeris 

 albis. Long. -21. 



Punto de los Reyes, one specimen, Mr. Davidson. There is no trace of any 

 posterior spots on the elytra : the band stops on the humerus, and is slightly 

 widened there.

A letter was read from Mr. Eugene Borda, dated Woodside, Schuyl-

 mens of Lepidodendron presented this evening. 



" One of the impressions is marked on both sides and is evidently the plant ; 

 the other fits exactly on one of the sides of the other. I have seen many Lepi- 

 dodendrons, but never any such specimen ; it is also the opinion of all those 

 who have seen them, and I hope they will be a valuable addition to the col- 

 lection of the Academy. 



The locality is top slate of Back Vein on the south side of Mine Hill, at our 

 Black Heath Colliery, the outlet of which is a tunnel at Wolf Creek, near 

 Minersville. The Back vein is under the Black Heath Vein, some 20 yards 

 west of the Mine Hill Gap. It keeps all the time distant from the Black Heath 

 Vein, but east of the Gap ; the two veins form but one, called the Mammoth 

 Vein, and extensively worked at Clair. ' ' 



A letter was read from George Davidson, Esq., dated San Francisco, 

 Cal., Oct. 15th, giving information concerning a valuable and extensive 

 series of specimens from the Geysers of the Pluton Canon, presented 

 this evening. 



By Express this steamer I shall try to send to the Academy two boxes con- 

 taining specimens of waters and products of the "Geysers," about 72 miles 

 N. N. W. of this city. I made a visit there for two or three days, and went 

 hurriedly over the whole ground, yet noting but a tithe of the wonders. The 

 collection may enable some of you to judge of this great natural curiosity. By 

 the same express 1 shall have forwarded a barrel containing the head, skin, 

 and back bone of a very large bass (?) caught in the bay a couple of clays ago, 

 and which I obtained, a 1 * ; that, if nothing new, it would at least make 



up in size for the want of novelty. Note i of his size, appearance, contents of 

 stomach, &c, were made by Dr. Ayres, but I have not yet obtained them. How- 

 ever, the following newspaper item will give you an idea of the specimen. 

 When weighed his tail and head were just touching the ground, yet the scale in-

Kotos and Descriptions of Foreign Eeptiles. 

 BY. E. D. COPE. 

 TESTUD1NATA. 



The following species of Tortoises were brought by Mr. P. B. Duchaillu from 

 equatorial West Africa, the present Autumn. 



Kinixys erosa Gray. This curious species appears to be abundant through- 

 out Gaboon, and the country of the Gamma aud Ogobai. Its range northward 

 extends as far as the Gambia. 



Sternothaerus Derbianus Gray. Length, including head and neck, 14 

 in. 8 lin.; length of plastron, 6 in. 6 lin.; greatest breadth of do., 5 in.; breadth 

 of head just before the tympani, 2 in. 5 lin. 



Inhabits swamps in the Cainma country. 



This is probably the above named species, but judging from figures and 

 descriptions, it approaches closely the S. s i nu at u s Smith, of South Africa, 

 differing mainly in the form of the upper mandible, which is obtusely hooked 

 in the former, bidentate in the latter. The habits of the two appear to differ ; 

 the S. African species inhabiting deep rivers, and remaining long at a time 

 beneath the surface. It^s considered by Dr. Gray (Catalogue Brit. Mus.) as 

 identical with the S. caftaneusM, but there is a manifest discrepancy 

 between Smiths description, and the brief one of castaneus in the "Cata- 

 logue," principally with regard to tbe form of the vertebral scuta. The 

 resemblance to the S. Derbianus is much closer, but judging as before, it 

 is our impression that it is distinct from both. 



Heptathyra nob. 

 Cartilaginous border obsolete at the sides of the disc, and destitute of ossicles 

 posteriorly. Sternum with two cartilaginous flaps, which cover the posterior 

 extremities when retracted. Sternal callosities seven; one on each side cor- 

 responding to the closely connected hyo- and hyposternals, one to each of the 



[Nov. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 295 



epi- and xiphisternal, and one to the discoid entosternal. Hyo- and hyposter- 

 nals united to the disc by suture, and separated from the episternals by a large 

 cartilaginous interval. Head acute, parietal region depressed, frontal slightly 

 arched. Nostrils not subdivided by a transverse process of the septum. Lips 

 greatly developed, forming biangular flaps on each side of the mouth. 



Heptathyra A u b r y i . Cryptopus Aubryi Dumeril. Revue et Magasin de 

 Zoologie; 1856, page 364. 



Total length 2 feet, 6 in.; of sternum 15 in. 6 lin.; of head and neck 11 inches. 

 Numerous specimens from the Fernando Vas river, Equatorial W. Africa. 



The Dogania subplana of India doubtless exhibits the extreme of the 

 Trionychoid modification of the Chelonian type, in the tardiness of the only 

 partial union of the ribs into a carapacial disc, and the imperfect development 

 of the sternal bones. There are but two callosities. Aspidonectes exhibits 

 a superior grade of organization. The union of the ribs is more com- 

 plete, a comparatively small part of their extremities extending beyond the 

 disc in adult age. The sternal bones are better developed, especially the hyo- 

 hypo- and xiphisternals. There are four external callosities. 



Those species which agree in possessing cartilaginous flaps upon the poste- 

 rior lobe of the sternum, are included by M. Dumeril in the single genus Cryp- 

 topus ; but in some respects they are strikingly dissimilar. T. uunctatus 

 and T. Senegalensis are very interesting, as possessing in the free marginal 

 ossicles the analogues of the marginal bones so universal among higher Che- 

 lonians. This far from unimportant peculiarity is wanting in the T. frenatus 

 and P e t e r s i i ; while the additional character of every sternal bone being pro- 

 tected by a corresponding external callosity (their number thus amounting to 

 nine), proves the propriety of the generic name Cycloderma assigned by 

 M. Peters. T. Aubryi, it is seen, agrees with the last in the absence of 

 ossicles, but maintains the more typical Trionychoid peculiarity of one undivided 

 callosity covering the hyo- and hyposternal boues. The extent of the union 

 of these, (hajmapophyses,) with the disc, (pleurapaphyses,) without lateral car- 

 tilaginous or osseous "appendage," offers as good an example of a normal 

 "haemal arch" as is to be found in the order. 



The object of generic nomenclature being, as we understand it, to indicate 

 the modifications of Nature's types and the sensible steps by which they approach 

 each other, to ignore any such step appears to us unphilosophical. Hence we 

 venture to propose for the species under consideration the generic appellation 

 of Heptathyra. 



Aspidonectes aspilus nob. Head acute, plane, not sloping as in Platy- 

 peltis. Lips thin, not developed into flaps. Septum of the nasal orifice with 

 a short process on each side. Ribs eight paira, projecting in the adult about 

 two inches beyond the disc. Disc subcircular, broadly truncate behind, vermi- 

 culately rugose. Vermiculations transverse along the sutures of the costal 

 plates, longitudinal between. Vertebral line slightly depressed. Cartilaginous 

 border extending two inches beyond the edge of the anterior sternal callosity, 

 and 9 in. 10 lin. from the posterior margin of the disc, to within 3 in. 6 lin. of 

 the end of the tail. Sternal callosities four. The posterior subtriangular, 

 anterior, and posterior angles divergent, the inner almost in contact. Anterior 

 angle with an emarginatiou corresponding to an angular process in the posterior 

 border of the hyposternal. The interior and exterior borders of the anterior 

 callosity made nearly right angles with its anterior edge. This is not perfectly 

 transverse, so that the inner borders approach to within 1 in. 11 lin. of each 

 other, they then round off and extend much farther posteriorly than the external 

 borders. Episternal bones small, considerably separated, diverging anteriorly. 

 Claws nearly straight, compressed, sharp at their inner edges, dirty white. 

 Disc brown, vermiculations shaded with yellow. Border, extremities, neck and 

 head dark brown, without spots or markings of any kind. Sternal callosities 

 whitish.

Habitat. The Rembo and Ovenga rivers, tributaries of the Fernando Vas, 

 Equatorial West Africa. 



Not having at hand specimens of the Aspidonectes niloticus of W. and S. 

 Africa, we have been unable to compare the only specimen of the aspilu s with 

 it; their differences are, however, sufficiently obvious. In the latter the sternal 

 callosities are much smaller, and the anterior pair have their anterior and 

 posterior borders nearly parallel, and the outline of the inner semicircular. 

 The tail is shorter, and the colors are brownish green with white and yellow 

 spots. 



The Old World Aspidonectes possess eight pairs of ribs ; we do not 

 know how it is with the American species, as there are no authentic specimens 

 in the Acad, mus., but our Amyda and Glatypeltis have but 7 pairs.

COL UBRIDJECALAMARINJE. 



Omsthenes nob. 

 Head scarcely distinct from the body, depressed, especially in front. Muzzle 

 elliptical in outline, projecting much beyond the under jaw, as does also the 

 superior labial region. At the posterior extremity of the superior maxillary 

 bone are two curved teeth, larger than the other maxillaries, separated from 

 them by an edentulous space, and grooved in front. Cephalic shields normal. 

 Vertical broad ; loral small. Rostral prominent, broad, dividing the anterior 

 frontals somewhat ; not recurved. Preocular 1, postoculars 2. Urosteges and 

 anal shield entire. Scales very smooth. 



0. euphaeus nob. Scales subequally hexagonal on the flanks, more elon- 

 gate on the back, very little imbricate ; in nineteen rows. The rows diminish in 

 number upon the tail, by two or more running together upon the dorsal region, 

 thus forming short series of from four to six scales twice or thrice the usual 

 width. Vertical plate broad, hexagonal, the anterior angle very obtuse, the 

 posterior acute, dividing the occipitals. Superciliaries rather small, broader 

 behind in consequence of the convergence of the sides of the vertical. Posterior 

 frontals large, extending on the side of the head halfway along the preocular. 

 Anterior frontals rather small. Nostril between two nasals ; the anterior large, 

 separating the rostral and first labial, and nearly reaching the edge of the 

 mouth. Rostral broad, triangular, depressed, slightly dividing the anterior 

 frontals. Postoculars two. Superior labials eight, the first three small, the 

 eye resting on the fourth and fifth. Pupil erect, elliptical. Inferior labials 

 eight, the fourth largest, and in contact with the posterior geneials, of which 

 there are two pairs. 



Gastrosteges 205, anal 1, urosteges 75. 



Color uniform brown, dark on the head and anterior part of the body, lighter 

 posteriorly, and pale beneath. 



Length 2 ft. 9 in. 6 lin. Tail 17 in. 6 lin. 



Had Dr. Guntber placed his Hologerrhum philippinum among the Calama- 

 rinae, instead ofScytalian Colubridae, we should have felt well satisfied in re- 

 cording this as a second species of that genus ; we are not positive, indeed, that it 

 may not yet be so considered ; but with our present knowledge we must distin- 

 guish it generically. The head of this serpent is very Calamarian in its indistinct- 

 ness from the body, its depression and projecting rostral. Besides these, a broader 

 vertical and more distinctly divided rostrals distinguish it from Hologerrhum.

Rhinosimus (D. and B.) placed by Giinther among the Calamarinse, differs 

 only in the keeled, recurved rostral, and Rbinostoma Fitz., the only other 

 genus with grooved maxillaries, has the recurved rostral, with divided urosteges. 

 The form and glossy smoothness of the Olisthenes euphaeus admirably 

 adapt it for making its way among pieces of bark, decayed logs, and other 

 debris of the forest. Its native country is unknown to us, but as it was ob- 

 tained in ajar containing a specimen of the species below mentioned, it proba- 

 bly came from South America.

 taeniurus, and conirostris, but without the transverse markings of 

 the first and second, and the peculiar plating of the last. There are numerous 

 specimens in the Acad. Mus. It does not appear to be known to European 

 herpetologists.

BY W. M. GABB. 



Myalina deltoidea. Shell triangular, flattened, beaks narrow, tapering 

 and curved anteriorly ; cardinal margin slightly curved and nearly as long as 

 the anterior edge ; anterior edge gently sinuous ; posterior edge nearly straight ; 

 basal edge rounded ; umbones subangular ; umbonal ridge running parallel 

 with the anterior border losing itself near the basal edge ; anterior umbonal 

 slope perpendicular to the plane of the valve ; posterior umbonal slope gentle, 

 and extends to the posterior edge ; inside, the cardinal third of the shell shows 

 an alation which is invisible exteriorly ; surface marked with indistinct con- 

 centric lamellae. 



This shell was found near Fort Belknap, either in the coal or in the stratum 

 of dark blue shale overlying the coal. The specimens, consisting of a left 

 valve, nearly perfect, and several fragments of the beaks showing the hinge 

 well preserved, are replaced by pyrites. 



Posidonia Moorei. Shell subquadrangular, slightly gibbous, cardinal 

 edge straight ; beaks small, near the anterior edge, and slightly projecting be- 

 yond the cardinal line ; umbones prominent, anterior edge rounded ; posterior 

 edge straight above, rounded below to meet the basal margin, which is regulaly 

 curved ; surface marked by about twenty prominent round concentric ribs. 



Locality and Position. From a buff colored limestone above the coal, near 

 Fort Belknap.

A sojourn of several months at Cape St. Lucas, Lower California, besides 

 furnishing many species of birds not found by me at Fort Tejon,* has brought 

 to light several species, which, as far as I have now the means of judging, 

 seem to be entirely new. I subjoin descriptions of those which appear to be 

 most decidedly undescribed birds, although it is very probable that a careful

examination of others of the collection made will result in the detection of ad- 

 ditional ones. 



I defer for the present any notice of the habits and peculiarities of these and 

 other birds of the Cape, preferring to make this the subject of a special memoir, 

 after a longer residence shall have enabled me to collect all the facts bearing 

 on this subject. 



Picus lucasanus, Xantus. 



General appearance that of Picus nuttalli and scalaris. Bill stout : as long as 

 or longer than the head. Above black, banded transversely with white on the 

 back and scapulars to the nape, the rump and outer tail feathers entirely black, 

 quills with a row of white spots on each web : the outer square, the inner 

 rounded, these spots on the tertials becoming transversely quadrangular. Be- 

 neath brownish white, with rounded black spots on 'the sides of the breast, 

 passing behind on the flanks and under tail coverts into transverse bars. 

 Greater inner wing coverts transversely barred. Outer two tail feathers white, 

 with one, sometimes two terminal bars, next to which are one or two bars on 

 the inner web only ; third feather black, the outer web mostly white, with traces 

 of a terminal black bar : sometimes there is a greater predominance of black 

 on the inner web. Two white stripes on side of head, one starting above, the 

 other below the eye with a tendency to meet behind and form a whitish collar 

 on the nape. Male with the entire top of the head streaked with red, becom- 

 ing more conspicuous behind ; each red streak with a white spot at base. 

 Feathers covering the nostrils smoky brown. 



Length 7-15, extent 12-15, wing 4-00, bill above 1-00, middle toe and claw 

 80. 



Campylorhynchcs affinis, Xantus. 



Very similar to C. brunneicapillus. Above grayish olive, each feather on the 

 back streaked with white, bordered externally by black. Upper tail coverts 

 and upper surface of tail grayish, with indistinct transverse black bars, much 

 broken ; quills with a marginal row of rounded whitish spots on each web. 

 Beneath white, sometimes very faintly tinged behind with yellowish brown ; 

 the whole under surface quite uniformly marked with rounded spots (more 

 elongated anteriorly) and of much the same size. On the breast these spots are 

 rather angular and generally do not cross both webs ; posteriorly, however, they 

 are more central, and several are sometimes strung along the shaft of the feather. 

 These spots are larger and rounder on the under tail coverts. Tail feathers, 

 excepting the two central black, each web banded from the base with alter- 

 nating bars of white, six or more in each series. Top of the head uniform cin- 

 namon brown, perhaps slightly paler towards the edges of the feathers ; a white 

 line from the nostrils over the eye to the nape, the white, however, streaked 

 with black. Bill and legs dark brown, base of under mandible paler. 



Length 7-50, extent 9-75, wing 4-35, tail 4-40, bill above -90, tarsus 1-10. 



Harporhynchus cinereds, Xantus. 



Very similar to Mimus montanus, with longer and more curved bill. The up- 

 per parts are grayish brown or cinereous with a faint trace of rufous on the 

 rump. Beneath white with a tinge of brownish yellowish towards the vent ; 

 the breast and sides with sharply defined sagittate or subtriangular spots of 

 brown, scarcely elongated on the sides, the shade of brown similar to, but 

 darker than that of the back. The lateral tail feathers are tipped with white, 

 the outer one sometimes edged with the same. There are two narrow dull 

 whitish bands on the wings. 



Length about 10 inches, wing 4-00, tail 4-75, bill above (in a straight line) 

 1-00. 



This species is very abundant at the Cape, and its nests are found among the 

 cactuses in large numbers. The eggs resemble those of the mocking birds 

 much more than those of the rest of the genus. 



[Nov. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 299 



Brachyrhamphus hypoleucu3, Xantus. 



Bill slender and slightly curved, about half the length of head. Tarsus scarcely 

 shorter than middle toe. Above dark brownish black, the edges of the feathers 

 with a plumbeous tinge ; the side of neck below, and the axillars with the 

 concealed portion of the sides of the breast, ashy plumbeous. Entire under 

 parts, including tail coverts and inside of the wings, pure white, this color ex- 

 tending on the sides of the head so as to include the eyes, the lids, however, 

 are tinged with dusky ; bill black ; legs apparently reddish in life. 



Length 10 inches, extent 15-80, wing 4-70, tail 1-80, bill above -70, gape 1-20, 

 tarsus -85, middle toe 1-00. 



This specimen is considerably weatherbeaten, and the old feathers of the up- 

 per parts are much worn, and bleached at the edges. The new ones are how- 

 ever as described. 



Notes on a collection of Birds made by Mr. John Xantus, at Cape St. Lucas, 

 Lower California, and now in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. 



BY S. F. BAIRD. 



Mr. Xantus, in transmitting to the Smithsonian Institution a collection of ob- 

 jects of Natural History made at Cape St. Lucas, Lower California, in the 

 months of April, May, and June, 1859, has added descriptions of the species 

 which he ascertained to be new by reference to the limited number of works at 

 his command. These all appear to be really nondescript, and a careful com- 

 parison of the entire collection with supposed analogues from the north, 

 shows differences in other species, entitling them to specific rank. 



The examination of the collections of Mr. Xantus has proved of very great 

 interest in elucidating the zoological peculiarities of the Cape, and especially in 

 showing that its fauna is almost identical with that of the Gila River, and to a 

 certain extent with that of the Rio Grande. It is an important fact also, that 

 while these relationships are exceedingly intimate, there is almost none to the 

 coast fauna of Upper California. As the birds were all collected during the 

 spring months, after the migrating species had passed northward, they may be 

 considered as especially characterizing the region. An examination of the list 

 will show that of the forty- two kinds thus far received from Mr. Xantus, seven, 

 or one-sixth, are peculiar to the Cape and probably new, while but two of the 

 land birds which characterize the Pacific region of upper California are found 

 there, all the other species being either distributed generally over the whole 

 United States, or belonging especially to the Gila or Rio Grande regions, sepa- 

 rately or collectively, and to that of the Southern Rocky Mountains. 



Similar conclusions are to be derived from an examination of the other land 

 vertebrates. The most characteristic mammal is the Spermopkilus harrisii, 

 heretofore only found in the Colorado desert. The Perognathus penecillatus, 

 another Colorado species, is also met with. The Macrotus calif ornicus, a leaf- 

 nosed bat, heretofore only known from a single specimen taken at Fort Yuma, 

 is very abundant. Lepus californicus and trowbridgii, Mephitis bicolor and Ves- 

 pertilio pallidus, Le Conte, appear to be species common to the Cape and to 

 Western Upper California, the two latter occurring also in Texas. 



In the Reptilia, also, very interesting facts are to be observed. Here, as far 

 as can be ascertained by a hasty examination, out of about twelve species of 

 Saurians, and as many Ophidians, not one is found in Upper California, the 

 species consisting (with the exception of a few new ones) of such as Dipsosaurus 

 dorsalis, Uta ornata and stansburiana, Sceloporus scalaris, Callisanrus ventralis, 

 Stenodactylus variegatus, frc. There is a Phrynosoma very similar to the " corona- 

 turn" of Upper California, but quite distinct. There is also a very large 



1859.] 




300 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Ctenosaura. 'The serpents are Opkibolus splendidus, a new Crotalus, Masticophis 

 testaceus ? a Rio Grande Nerodia, Arizona elegans, Scotophis Emoryii, Lamprosoma 

 episcopum, etc., or species very closely allied to them. 



The Zoology of the east side of the gulf of California is not sufficiently well 

 known to allow a satisfactory comparison with that of Cape St. Lucas ; it is 

 however probable that the Gila fauna does not extend as far down as the lati- 

 tude of the Cape, being displaced by the northward extension of the 

 fauna of Western Mexico. Even at Guaymas, species of birds and reptiles occur, 

 of genera different from those of the United States, as for instance the genus 

 Dryophis among the serpents. 



It may safely be considered as very probable, that additional species of the 

 Gila and Colorado regions will hereafter be detected at the Cape, and that a 

 closer examination of the former localities will bring to light several of the 

 species for the first time noticed in the Cape collection of Mr. Xantus. 



What the causes are which have produced this peculiar distribution of ani- 

 mal life on the Cape, it is at present impossible fully to elucidate. The moun- 

 tain crests which extend longitudinally along the peninsula might form an 

 impassible barrier to the passage of species from one coast to the other, but as 

 there appears to be no greater obstacle to the extension southward to Cape St. 

 Lucas from the coast region of Upper California, than from the mouth of the 

 Colorado along the east side of the peninsula, we would expect to find a much 

 greater mixture of species at the Cape than really exists. No information is at 

 present at our command as to the zoology of the interior of the peninsula. It is, 

 however, quite probable that the narrow vallies enclosed between the moun- 

 tainous sides of the peninsula may have species widely different from either 

 those of the Cape itself, and of Upper California, and more analogous to those 

 of Mazatlan and its vicinity. 



The region in which Mr. Xantus obtained the birds hereafter enumerated, is 

 one which at first sight would not seem a very promising field for exploration. 

 The shore is sandy for about a quarter of a mile inland, whence a cactus desert 

 extends for a width of about six miles up to the high mountains on the West and 

 North. The Cereus giganteus is a prominent feature in this peculiar vegetation, 

 rising occasionally to a height of sixty or more feet. The ground is covered for 

 miles with a saline efflorescence, painful to the eye, into or through which the 

 feet sink to a considerable distance. There is no fresh water nearer than San 

 Jose, a distance of twenty-eight miles. The region, though in the spring and 

 summer inhabited almost exclusively by land birds, is said in the rest of the 

 year to be the resort of innumerable water fowl and waders, among which Mr. 

 Xantus will doubtless find many rare species. 



Before proceeding to an enumeration of the summer birds of Cape St. Lucas, 

 it may be well to state that they illustrate in a remarkable degree the law de- 

 rived from an examination of large series of specimens in the Smithsonian 

 museum, and frequently referred to in the ninth volume of the Pacific R. R. 

 Report ; namely, that whenever species have a wide range in latitude as resi- 

 dent birds or as summer visitors, the farther North the species is found breed- 

 ing, the larger it is, and vice versa. The same principle applies, though in less 

 marked degree, to an increasing altitude in the same latitude. The difference 

 in size between the same species of bird breeding at Cape St. Lucas and in 

 the Colorado Valley, or in the more northern Rocky Mountains, is very strik- 

 ing, so much so as readily to induce the impression of a difference in the 

 species. 



The following table will illustrate more fully what has been said in regard to 

 the geographical distribution and character of the species. It will be seen that 

 all the characteristic land species of the Cape (all supposed to be new except- 

 ing Colaptes chrysoides) are exceedingly abundant, breeding in large num- 

 bers.

An examination of the table will show that seven (all new) out of forty-two 

 species may as yet be considered as peculiar to Cape St. Lucas. Two land 

 birds and two water birds belong to the coast region of Western North America ; 

 two species are peculiar to the Lower Gila and Colorado, (Centurns uropygialis 

 and Colaptes chrysoides,) although both may be found in time as far east as 

 El Paso, i On the other hand, fourteen of the species occur in the region ex- 

 tending from the Gila to the lower Rio Grande, none of them found in 

 Upper California, although several stretch northward in the Rocky Mountain 



i If this large-billed bird be considered as distinct (M.pertinax) from the true Af. mexi- 

 canus, it will be entered only in the Cape column. 



2 Found in the extension of the mountains south-east into Mexico 



3 Extending northward as far as Fort Bridger. 



4 Confined to the southern end of this region ; at Fort Tejon. 



5 Found on the Pecos only in this region.

region considerably beyond the latitude of San Francisco. But a single species 

 ( Garzetta thula, ) belongs to the South American fauna ; and this may not be 

 the same bird as the Chilian. 



One of the most striking facts of all is that not a single land animal has 

 been identified as found in Mexico and not in the United States also. Not 

 a single bird of the Western Tierra Caliente of Mexico has been yet met with, 

 however abundant it may be on the opposite side of the gulf, not much over a 

 hundred miles across. 



The case, however, is quite different with the marine invertebrates, whicb, 

 as might be expected, are very closely related to those of Western Mexico. 

 The accompanying note* from Mr. Stimpson will illustrate the character of 

 the Crustacea of the Cape. 



List of Birds collected from the middle of April to the middle of July, 1859. 



1. TiNNtracDLUs sparverius, Vieillot. 



2. Bubo virginianus, Bonaparte. 



3. Picus lucasanus, Xantus. This species is intermediate in character be- 

 tween P. scalaris and P. nuttalli, resembling them very closely, and belonging 

 to the same division of the genus. It has the brown feathers on the nostrils, 

 the whole top of the head spotted with red, and the predominance of white 

 on the cheeks of the former, and the deficiency of black bars in the white of 

 the tail feathers of the latter ; the black bars, except at the tip, not crossing 

 the outer web, and the outer web of the third feather being almost entirely 

 white. The bill and feet, the latter especially, are very stout and large, much 

 more so than in the others, in nuttalli, especially. In size, it is about inter- 

 mediate between the other two. 



4. Centurus uropygialis, Baird. As in the other woodpeckers, the speci- 

 mens of this species have a peculiar weather-beaten and dull appearance. 



5. Colaptes chrysoides, Malherbe. This bird is only known from an im- 

 perfect description by Malherbe of a single female specimen, and this author 

 was ignorant of the peculiar feature of the male of this species, namely, in it 

 combining the characters of both C. auratus and mexicanus. Thus, with ashy 

 throat and cheeks, and broad, red moustache and absence of nuchal red of the 

 latter, the shafts and under surface of the wing and tail are gamboge yellow, 

 as in C. auratus. The tail feathers are more tipped with black than in either 

 species, the outer being of this color for more than the terminal inch, and 

 along most of the outer web. The jugular collar and the spots on the breast 

 are considerably larger than in the other species. The top of the head is 

 light yellowish brown. In size, this species is considerably inferior to that of 

 C. auratus. 



C. mexicanoides of Lafresnaye has the shafts red. 



In the Report on birds of Pacific R. R., Series IX. p. 125, I refer to a 

 female Colaptes, collected by Mr. Schott, on the line of the Mexican boundary 

 survey, as possibly of this species. This proves now to be the fact, and ex- 

 tends the range of the species to the valley of the Gila River. The following 



* More than sixty species of Crustacea have already been collected by Mr. Xantus, 

 more than half of which are new. They belong to the genera Pisa, Thoe, Micippa, Milkrax, 

 Pericera, Lambrus, Alergatis, Xantthus, Pilumnus, Ozius, Eriphia, Ocypode, Grapsus, 

 Pachygrapsus, Nautilograpsus, Calappa, Dromidia, Pctrolisthes, Remipes, Albunea, 

 Lepidops, Cwnobita, Calcinus, Eupagurus, Alpheus, Palcemon, Livoneca, Ligea, Orchestia, 

 Hyperia, and several new ones. This new and rich Carcinological Fauna differs entirely 

 from that of the Upper Californian Coast, not a single species being identical, and approxi- 

 mates more nearly to that of the Western coast of Mexico, from Guaymas to Acapulco ; 

 also in some degree to that of the Gallapagos Islands. Nearly all of the species described 

 by De Saussure as inhabiting the Bay of Mazatlan, (Rev. et Mag, de Zoologie v. 354-368), 

 have been found by Mr. Xantus at Cape St. Lucas.

detailed description of this little known species may be of interest : Above 

 yellowish ash transversely barred with black. Chin, throat, and sides of head 

 clear ash ; under parts white : a broad pectoral crescent, and rounded spots on 

 remaining under parts black.- Top of head light brown. Shafts of wing 

 and tail feathers gamboge yellow. Tail black ; the basal portion yellow ; the 

 outer feathers uniformly black on the exposed terminal half, including the 

 shafts. No red on the nape. Bill black. Iris light brown. Male with a 

 broad, red moustache. No trace of a moustache in the female. 

 Length of male about 11-00 ; wing 5 - 50 ; tail 4'50 ; bill above 1*50. 



6. Geococcyx californianus, Baird. 



7. Chokdeiles texensis, Lawrence. 



8. Myiarchus mexicanus, Baird. This bird does not appear exactly the 

 same with the species of the United States and Mexico, although I can see no 

 other difference than a rather stouter bill. This, however, appears to be a 

 constant character, and may one day cause its separation as a species (M. 

 pertinax, Baird.) 



9. Sayornis nigricans, Bonaparte. 



10. Empidonax obscuros, Baird. 



11. Hirundo thalassina, Swainson. Much smaller than specimens from 

 Oregon. 



12. Progne purpurea, Boie. 



13. Phaiuopepla nitens, Sclater. 



14. Mimus polyglottus, Boie. The specimens do not exhibit the same 

 elongation of the tail as remarked in skins from Upper California. The tail 

 appears, however, a little longer than in specimens from the Atlantic States. 



15. Harporhynchus cinereus, Xantus. This species is very similar in 

 color and markings to Mimus montanus, although rather larger, with a con- 

 siderably longer and more curved bill. It is nearly as large as H. longirostris, 

 the bill of about the same length, though more curved. It differs from it, 

 however, in the grayish plumage above, in the whitish tips to the tail, and in 

 having short sagittate spots beneath, instead of elongated black ones. Besides 

 the longer bill and other features, it lacks the rufous tinge of upper parts seen 

 in H. rufus. It is smaller than H. curvirostris, the spots beneath much more 

 distinct and sagittate. They are darker than the back, instead of being of the 

 same color. 



As already remarked, the shade of the coloration and pattern of marking 

 are almost precisely those of Mimus montanus, while the bill is much like that 

 of H. longirostris. 



16. CampyI/Orhynchps affinis, Xantus. This species is about the size of 

 C. brunneicapillus, and resembles it closely in general appearance. The com- 

 parison of an extensive series of both will, however, exhibit unmistakable 

 differences. 



The anal region and thighs of brunneicapillus have a strongly fulvous ten- 

 dency, (nearly wanting in qffinis,) and the spots beneath are much smaller, 

 in fact, scarcely more than shaft lines ; on the throat and jugulum, on the 

 contrary, the spots occupy almost the entire breadth of the feather, very con- 

 spicuously larger than the others. In G. affinis the spots beneath are very 

 nearly of the same size, being larger on the belly and smaller on the throat 

 than in the other species : the latter but little the larger. 



The lateral tail feathers in brunneicapillus are black, all with a subterminal 

 band of white : the external feather has both webs banded with white 

 throughout. The next has a trace of a second terminal band, and there are 



1859.] 22 




304 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



bands on the whole of the outer web. The remaining feathers, except the 

 central ones, are banded only on the outer webs ; sometimes not then, when 

 the whole feather is black, except at the tip. In the other species, C. affinis, 

 all the feathers (except the central) are banded uniformly with white from 

 the base, there being from six to eight on each web, which alternate with 

 each other, the bands being about equal to their black interspaces. The streaks 

 on the back are more distinctly denned than in brunneicapillus, and the head 

 above is of a clear, reddish chocolate, instead of the darker brown of the latter 

 species.* 



17. Poljoptila melanura, Lawrence. The single specimen of this species 

 sent in by Mr. Xantus has the tail feathers more broadly edged and tipped 

 with white, and the gray of the back lighter and clearer than in specimens in 

 the Smithsonian collection from the Gila region. 



18. Pakoides flaviceps, Baird. Specimens are much smaller than those 

 from the Gila and Rio Grande. The yellow on the head also is brighter. In 

 some there is a tinge of red in the yellow of the crown. "Wing of male l - 90 

 inches. 



19. Carpodacus frontalis, Gray. Very similar to northern specimens, but 

 smaller. The resemblance to some Rocky Mountain skins in the Smithsonian 

 collection is very close. 



-20. Chondestes grammaca, Bonap. 



"21. Zonotrichea leucophrys, Swains. It is an interesting fact that this 

 species should be found at the Cape, instead of gambelii. It is to be borne in 

 mind that both are found along the Rocky Mountains as far south as El Paso, 

 and that Z. leucophrys has not yet been detected in Upper California. 



22. Calajiospiza bicolor, Bonap. This species has not yet been detected in 

 Upper California. 



. 23. Guiraca melanocephala, Swainson. 



24. Cyanospiza versicolor, Baird. The female of this species is very 

 similar to those of C. cyanea and amosna. From the latter it is distinguishable 

 by the absence of traces of two white bands on the wings, and from both by 

 the legs being black instead of dark brown. The bill appears to be more 

 curved, and the legs larger than in the other species. 



25. Pyrrhuloxia sinuata, Bonap. Smaller than Texan specimens. 



* The following account of common and specific characters may serve to define the 

 species better. 



Head above uniform brown ; back and scapulars grayish brown, each feather with a 

 central white streak bordered externally by black ; upper tail coverts and upper surface 

 of inner tail feathers, obscurely marked transversely with grayish and blackish, other tail 

 feathers black, barred with white. A white streak over the eye and along side of ^neck^ 

 Body beneath white, with rounded spots of black; strongly marked on the under tail coverts^ 



C brunneicapillus. Head above dark brown ; black spots on the throat and breast, 

 large, occupying the whole breadth of the end of the feather, the spots on the remaining 

 under parts abruptly'much smaller and less numerous. Crissum lower belly and flanks 

 strongly tinged with pale rufous. The black tail feathers, except the outer, scarcely 

 barred with white, except as a subterminal bar. 



C. affinis. Head above dull light chocolate brown ; black spots beneath of much the 

 same size and strongly marked on nearly every feather, and but little if any more con- 

 spicuous on the jugulum than elsewhere; on the jugulum they are about opposite the 

 middle of the feather (not at ihe tip) and do not cross both webs ; very little trace of 

 rufous any where beneath. All the black tail feathers are crossed wkh white bands on 

 both webs throughout their whole extent. Length 7 - 50 ; wing 3 - 50 ; tail 3.25 ; bill above 

 -SO; tarsus 1-00.

26. Cabdctahs igneus, Baird, n. s. A Cardinal very abundant at the Cape ; 

 appeared at first sight to be the same with the C. virginianus. A comparison, 

 however, of a large number of males with as many from the eastern United 

 States and Texas, shows a difference, in the entire absence of black on the 

 forehead between the nostrils, the red of the heSd coming down to the base of 

 the culmen. The black of the side of the bill extends to the nostrils, but not 

 between them on the forehead as in virginianus. The bill is larger and de- 

 cidedly more tumid. The size, shape and colors are as in virginianus, the 

 bill too being red, instead of white as in phoeniceus. 



27. Pipilo albigula, Baird, n. s. Specimens of a Pipilo with the general 

 aspect of mesoleucus, exhibit a constant difference in a rather greater extent of 

 white on the middle of the belly. The chin and upper part of the throat are 

 bounded by a border of dusky spots, which does not extend as far towards the 

 jugulum as in mesoleucus, and is much better and more regularly defined below, 

 not being broken up irregularly. The space enclosed by this border of spots 

 is yellowish brown on the chin as in mesoleucus, but inferiorly on the throat 

 and in front of the spots it becomes nearly, and sometimes quite white, in de- 

 cided contrast to the chin color. The bill appears to be more slender. Both 

 forms agree in having the chestnut hood, the dusky spot on the breast, and 

 the white of the belly distinguishing them from P.fuscus. The size is that of 

 mesoleucus from the Rocky Mountains, and inferior to that of fuscus. 



28. Agelaius . A skin of a female Agelaius does not afford charac- 

 ters sufficient to determine a species. It was collected at San Jose, some ten 

 miles northeast of the point of the cape. 



29. Icterus parisorum, Bonap. The female of this species is olivaceous 

 above, (lighter on the rump,) and yellow beneath. The tail feathers, except 

 the middle ones, are greenish yellow, becoming grayish brown on the terminal 

 third (which is black in the male, ) and narrowly tipped with whitish. Ther 

 are two distinct bands of white on the wing. The lores and throat are tinged 

 with dusky. 



30. Icterus cucullatus, Swainson. 



31. Cyanocitta californica, Strickland. Rather smaller than more north- 

 ern specimens, but apparently similar. There is, however, a tendency to the 

 blue tinge of the under tail coverts seen in C. woodkousii, Baird. 



32. Melopelia leucoptera, Bonap. A very abundant species. 



33. ChamvEPElia passerina ? var. pallescens, Baird. A comparison of an ex- 

 tensive series of Cliamcepelia from Cape St. Lucas, with a similar one from the 

 Southern Atlantic States, shows constant differences in the shade of coloration 

 which may be of importance. The pattern is the same, but the shades are 

 considerably lighter. The chin and anal region are nearly white, the color of 

 the latter considerably lighter than that of the belly anterior to it, instead of 

 being much the same. The amethystine spots on the wings are smaller and 

 apparently less numerous. The bill seems darker, all the hard portion being 

 black, instead of this color being confined to the tip. The tertials do not ap- 

 pear to extend so far along the wing, falling short of the tip by about three- 

 quarters of an inch, scarcely reaching to the end of the eighth primary, instead 

 of to within less than half an inch or to the end of the fifth or sixth primary. 

 The tarsi appear stouter in the Cape bird. 



34. LOPHORTYX CALIFORNICUS, Bonap. 



35. Garzetta thula, Bonap. ? A white heron (No. 273) closely allied to 

 G. candidissima appears to be immature, being without the plumose, occipital 

 and dorsal feathers. It differs from candidissima in the longer bill (3*50 in. 

 above, instead of 3.15), and in the shorter tarsi (3-60 instead of 4*05.) The 



1859.]

toes too are shorter. The lower mandible is yellow along the entire line of the 

 gonys, and laterally for the basal half. The toes, though evidently not black 

 orginally like the tarsi, are yet of a greenish black in the dried specimen, 

 quite distinct from the decide^ yellowish of the other species. 



An examination of the adult will be necessary to show whether this bird is 

 really the thula of Chili or not. It is certainly larger and otherwise different 

 from specimens brought from Chili by Lt. Grilliss. 



36. Aegialitis vociferus, Cassin, 



37. Calidris arenaria, Illiger. 



38. Fulica Americana, Gmelin. 



39. Graculus dilophus? Gray. Immature. 



40. Thalassidroma melania, Bonap. A single specimen of this species was 

 collected by Mr. Xantus. I have seen one other obtained near San Francisco 

 by Mr. Gruber of that city. 



41. Blasipus heermannx, Bonaparte. Young birds only collected. 



42. Brachyrhamphus hypoleucus, Xantus. The occurrence of a species of 

 this genus as a summer visitor to a point so far south as Cape St. Lucas, or at 

 the latitude of less than 23 N. is a fact of much interest, when we remember 

 that the auks have all been considered more or less arctic birds. The affinities 

 of the new species appear to be chiefly with B. marmoratus, although it lacks 

 the white scapulars, has the inside of the wing white, instead of sooty, and 

 much longer tarsi. Its relations to B. brachypterus, hittlitzii and wrangelii of 

 Brandt it is difficult to determine from the short descriptions of that author. 

 It come closest to the description of B. brachypterus, but the tarsus is shorter 

 than the middle toe, not longer. 



MINERALOGICAL NOTES. No. II. 



BY WILLIAM JOHNSON TAYLOR. 



The number of interesting minerals which have been referred to me by gen- 

 tlemen of the Academy, are but partially described in the present paper. Des- 

 criptions and analyses of several minerals of interest, including at least one 

 new species, I have been obliged to defer for a subsequent communication to 

 the Academy. 



Clayite a new mineral. 



This mineral is remarkable as being near galena in form and composition, 

 being a sulphide of lead with about twenty-five per cent, of arsenic, antimony 

 and copper, forming the third of a series of which galena is the first, cuproplum- 

 bite (found in an adjoining State, Chili) is second, and which contains some 

 copper and sulphur, but not any antimony and arsenic. In the cuproplumbite 

 the lead is partially replaced by copper, and in Clayite this also is the case, but 

 a part of the sulphur is also replaced by antimony and arsenic. 



Clayite is remarkable as containing so small a per centage of sulphur be- 

 tween eight and nine per cent. only. It occurs in small monometric crystals, 

 the predominating form of which appears to be a combination of the tetrahe- 

 dron with the dodecahedron ; they occur as a coating on a layer of quartz, 

 about a thirty-second of an inch in thickness, which incrusts the massive por- 

 tion of the mineral. This massive portion of the mineral is filled with minute 

 quartz crystals, which are microscopic, but the presence of this quartz and the 

 existence of minute fissures has permitted the mineral to be somewhat acted 

 upon by the air, and to suffer a probably partial decomposition, as is evinced 



[Nor. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA.

by the decolorization of the surface by a bronze tarnish and the occurrence in 

 the crevices of the blue Covelline (?). 



The crystals of Clayite do not appear to be in the least acted upon. Tn color 

 they are a blackish gray, are quite small, the form only to be distinguished by 

 a strong pocket lens, and no cleavage observed. Rubbed in an agate mortar, 

 they are quite malleable, though at first quite frangible. Streak black gray ; 

 sectile. Hardness about 2-5. 



Before the blow-pipe on charcoal it fuses easily, giving a yellow incrustation 

 surrounded by a white incrustation ; with carbonate of soda a strong alliaceous 

 odor, and a brilliant metallic globule when hot, which becomes dull and lustre- 

 less on cooling. 



The crystals, as before mentioned, coated a thin layer of quartz, on which 

 they were associated with small crystals of chalcopyrite. They were carefully 

 freed from all extraneous matter, and the analyses gave the following results :

subtraction of the quartz :

 I have seen but one specimen of this mineral, which was given me by Joseph 

 A. Clay, Esq., having been sent to him from Peru by his brother Hon. J. Randolph 

 Clay, United States Minister to that country. It was labelled "Pabonado en 

 Rocicler de Aranzazu." The appearance of the massive mineral is not unlike 

 some of the gray coppers, though its color is more of a bluish gray. This 

 peculiarity together with the bronze tarnish of its surface, with the blue spots 

 of Covelline (?) and the excess of lead as shown by blow-pipe examination, in- 

 duced me to make a quantitative analysis of both the massive mineral and the 

 crystals. The entire specimen was small, and the proportion of the crystallized 

 mineral being also small, I was obliged to make the examination with a very 

 limited amount of material. The determination of the specific gravity must be 

 deferred until more of the mineral is obtained. 



I name this mineral in honor of the Messrs. Clay, whose interest and exertions 

 in mineralogy are so well known to mineralogists in this country and abroad. 



The protracted illness of Prof. J. D. Dana, and his subsequent departure for 

 Europe, prevented his measurement of the microscopic crystals which I had 

 sent to New Haven. 



Stromeyerite. 



The specimen of this mineral which I obtained from the cabinet of Joseph A. 

 Clay, Esq., was remarkable as resembling, in many of its characters, the mine- 

 ral Sternbergite more than Stromeyerite. A blow-pipe examination, in which 

 I found copper, together with the want of flexibility in the crystals, and their 

 high lustre, led me to refer the mineral to Stromeyerite. To decide this doubt- 

 ful point, I picked out with difficulty a little of the pure mineral for analysis. 



The mineral is from Copiapo, Chili. It occurs in small six-sided aggregated 

 crystals belonging to the trimetric system, not exceeding an eighth () of an 

 inch in diameter, which are implanted on minute quartz crystals, forming 

 rose-like or fan-like clusters, having the striae of distinctly marked, and with 

 striae on the edges. In its appearance (as before mentioned) it is more like 

 Sternbergite, but differs by the absence of flexibility, and also possesses more 

 lustre than any specimens of Sternbergite which I have seen. 



Hardness from' 2-5 to 3. Lustre metallic: color dark steel gray: streak 

 nearly black and shining. Sectile, does not soil paper : crystals brittle. 



The Stromeyerite occurs in small veins and fissures in barytes, the sides of 

 which are lined with very small quartz crystals and associated with small crys- 

 tals of Pyrargyrite. 



Before the blow-pipe on charcoal fuses to a white globule, somewhat malle- 

 able, which, with the fluxes, gives the reaction of copper: with carbonate of 

 soda gives the reaction of sulphur. 



The following are the results of my analyses :

POLYBASITE. 



I am indebted to Joseph A. Clay, Esq., also, for a duplicate specimen of an unde- 

 termined mineral, which he lately received from Peru, labelled "A compact silver 

 ore from San Pedro Nolasio, Tres Puntos, near Copiapo." From a fragment of 

 a crystal I made an approximative analysis, which proves the mineral to belong 

 to this species, as I have with the quantity at my disposal (0-0814 grammes,) 

 been able with care to determine the proportion of the sulphides of silver and 

 copper, which prove by the excess of base, that the mineral is of the species so 

 appropriately named Polybasite. 



The specimen which I have, contains short tabular hexagonal crystals, the 

 terminal planes of which show the triangular striae. These crystals are imbed- 

 ed in crystallized gypsum, and are more developed by keeping the specimen for 

 a short time in cold water. Calcite in scaleneohedrous crystals, minute portions 

 of blende and pyrites were also associated in the specimen. 



Hardness about 2. Lustre metallic : color between steel gray and iron black.

Glascerite (?) 



In No. 1 of " Mineralogical Notes," published in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences for August, 1858, I mention a mineral which I 

 found among some specimens recently presented to the Academy, brought from 

 the Chincha Islands of the Pacific Ocean ; it was labelled " Ammonia."' From 

 its appearance I suspected it to be a sulphate. By a qualitative analysis the 

 sulphate of ammonia was found to be combined with a sulphate of one of the 

 fixed alkalies, which I then supposed to be principally soda. By a quantitative 

 analysis I now find that the quantity of soda is a minimum, and that the prin- 

 cipal alkali is potash. The salt is therefore really a double sulphate of potash 

 and ammonia, and notwithstanding the probability of its being a distinct salt 

 and a new mineral species, I will, for the present, refer it to Glascerite, with a 

 mark of interrogation. There is mentioned in Gmelin's Handbook of Chemis- 

 try, (Cavendish edition, vol. iii. p. 71.) a sulphate of potash and ammonia, which 

 from the description therein given, accords with this mineral, (" scaley, shining, 

 bitter crystals, unacted upon by the air and leaving neutral sulphate of potash 

 when ignited.") Not one analysis is given, neither is the proportion of potash 

 and ammonia mentioned, but reference is made to an article on this substance 

 (artificial double sulphate of potash and ammonia) by Link, Chemische An- 

 nalen von Dr. Lorenz Crell, 179, i, 29, to which work it is not in my power 

 to refer. 



The glascerite (?) is in compact lumps or concretions about the size of 

 hickory nuts ; the color is yellowish white, with a crystalline structure ; taste 

 pungent and bitter opaque ; permanent in the air. Hardness about 2. Reac- 

 tion with litmus paper perfectly neutral. Before the blow-pipe on platinum 

 foil, blackens and fuses with difficulty, leaving a white bead which is soluble 

 in water and tastes a little saline and bitter. When heated in a platinum cru- 

 cible it becomes first black and then burns perfectly snow-white, not fusing at a 

 high heat.

Description of new species of the Coleopterous family Histeridse. 

 BY JOHN LECONTE. 



In the year 1845, when I published a Monograph of the American Histeroid3 

 in the Boston Journal of Natural History, my memoir contained seventy-nine 

 species. There were probably at that time contained in European collections, 

 about two-hundred and fifty species collected from all parts of the world. Since 

 then, the Abbe de Marseulhas published his great work, "Essai monographique 

 sur la famille des Histerides," and furnished accurate descriptions of six hun- 

 dred and twenty species, besides collecting from other writers one hundred 

 and twenty-six more which he has not been able to see. Of these, forty-five 

 species were brought by my son from California. I now add twenty-five 

 species from our own country, from Central America, and from Cuba, with one 

 from Africa, making the whole number at present known to be seven hundred 

 and seventy-two. 



To what sum this may hereafter be increased, it is impossible to say, a great 

 part of California has not yet been explored, and the States of New Mexico and 

 Texas have as yet yielded very few. It is remarkable that among the numerous 

 collections made by different exploring parties, so few of this family of insects 

 have been found. Perhaps they may have found it disagreeable to look for 

 them in the peculiar situations where most of them inhabit. 



I add a few words respecting the name Hister. This word is said to be derived 

 from the Latin Histrio, or Etruscan Histrion, meaning a player, on account of 

 some few of them having red marks on the elytra, or from their feigning death 

 (as a vast number of insects do) when first caught, which derivation appears 

 inappropriate. The Roman poet D. J. Juvenalis in his second satire, verse 41, 

 mentions a filthy fellow of the name of Hister. Linnaeus was fond of alluding 

 to the classic writers of Rome, and finding these insects living in the most 

 filthy conditions, very properly gave this name to animals found in the midst 

 of excrements and putrefaction.

The European species, to which this is very n early allied, has no margin to 

 the thorax, but merely a marginal stria. Our sp ecies wants the small furrow 

 at the exterior base of the margin of the thorax. The thorax is moreover more 

 finely and sparsely and the elytra more coarsely punctate. 



In my Monograph of these insects,, the American was considered identical 

 with the European species.

* This genus and the one preceding it, belong to the family Lyonetidae in the system 

 of European writers. The close relationship indicated in the structure of the perfect in- 

 sects, and the general harmony of their histories, do not, however, in my own view, au- 

 thorize the separation of the genera here described, into distinct families.

The anterior wings are pointed (from the outline of the cilia appearing to be 

 elliptical,) the posterior lanceolate. Injthe anterior wings the discoidal cell is 

 acute behind ; the subcostal nervure sends two short branches to the costa, and 

 from the apex of the discoidal cell a single vein to the tip. The median ner- 

 vure sends two veins to the inner margin near the tip. In Desmodiella there is 

 but one subcosto-marginal vein. In the posterior wings both the subcostal and 

 median nervures are simple. 



There are two larval forms in this genus. In the first, the head is much 

 longer than broad, acutely ellipsoidal, with the sides rather thick and rounded ; 

 the body is cylindrical, submoniliform and the thoracic rings somewhat swollen. 

 In the second, the head is thin and flattened, with the mandibles forming an 

 appendage in front ; the body flattened, deeply incised and mammillated on the 

 sides. In both groups there are three pairs of thoracic feet, three of abdominal 

 and a terminal pair, but shorter in the second than the first. 



The larvae mine the upper and under side of leaves, the larvse of the first 

 group usually throwing the leaf into a fold and feeding from the margins of the 

 mine to the center ; those of the second forming a flat mine, sometimes a rather 

 broad linear tract and sometimes an irregular blotch, their mandibles being 

 capable of working only in a horizontal direction. They change into pupa 

 within the mine, some weaving a firm cocoon, some suspended in a web, and 

 some forming a cocoon of grains of excrement and silk, or constructing the 

 outline of the cocoon with them. The cocoons of the second group are shown 

 on the separated epidermis as a circle and an almost hemispherical protuber- 

 ance on the under surface. 



The perfect insects rest with the antennas thrown backward beneath the wings, 

 some with the head slightly elevated, others with the head applied to the surface 

 and the body behind elevated. I think the majority of the species here de- 

 scribed assume the latter position, with variations in the angle formed with the 

 surface on which they rest.

 the wing, and somewhat suffused with golden beneath the fold. From the 

 middle to the tip, pale golden, with four costal silvery streaks, dark-margined 

 internally, and two dorsal silvery streaks, the first opposite the second costal 

 streak, and both dark-margined internally ; the first costal streak not decidedly 

 dark-margined. Apical spot, black. Hinder marginal line in the cilia, dark 

 brown ; cilia pale gray. Hind wings shining bluish gray ; cilia gray. 



The larva mines the under side of the maple leaf, Acer saccharinum, in

 by the ingesta. " Fras3" collected into a ball within the mine. The pupa is 

 suspended in a web of silk within the mine.

a dorsal streak of the same hue and joined or nearly joined to it. Just behind 

 the apical spot is a straight silvery streak, black-margined internally. Between 

 the first and second dorsal streaks, is a short black streak in the fold. _ Apical 

 spot, black und round, with a hinder marginal blackish line in the cilia ; cilia 

 grayish. Hind wings, shining dark gray, cilia the same. 



The larva mines the underside of the locust leaf (Robinia p s e u d-a c a c i a) 

 the separated epidermis of which is conspicuously white. It may be found in 

 the latter part of September and the beginning of October. The pupa is con- 

 tained in a white silken cocoon within the mine. The imago appears in the 

 latter part of October, and early in November. I have not found a spring or 

 summer brood in the leaf of the locust. The larva is cylindrical ; the head pale 

 brown ; the body pale greenish white, with a red vascular line from the 5th to 

 the 9th segment ; on the 9th segment are two irregular patches, chrome yellow ; 

 sometimes these patches are wanting. 



The under side of the leaf of Amphicarpaea monoica is also mined by 

 a larva, which I believe is the same as that in the leaf of the locust. It may 

 be found in the beginning of September, the imago in October. The imago 

 differs very slightly from Robiniella, and I have no note of any difference in the 

 larval state, and like Robiniella it weaves a white silken cocoon within its 

 mine. The perfect insect differs from the foregoing species in the following 

 respects : the wing beneath the fold is blackish at the base, with a silvery dorsal 

 spot rather nearer the base than the first costal spot and exterior to the dark- 

 margin, it is silvery, dusted with blackish ; the second costal spot is not as dis- 

 tinctly angled in the middle and the apical spot is larger ; in some specimens 

 there are two dorsal white lines on the thorax. The general resemblance be- 

 tween the two is so marked that I consider it unnecessary to designate it as a 

 variety, for it is undoubtedly, I think, the same insect. 



With a single subcosto-marginal nervule. 



3. L. Des modi e 11a. Antennse dark brown, tipped with a silvery hue 

 Front whitish, with a ruby-colored lustre ; frontal tuft dark brown. Thorax 

 with a splendent ruby hue. Fore wings ferruginous brown, ruby-tinted at the 

 base, with two silvery bands dark-margined on both sides, one near the base 

 and one in the middle of the wing. A costal and dorsal silvery spot near the 

 tip, opposite to each other, and a costal silvery spot just before the tip, the two 

 former dark-margined on both sides, and the latter slightly dark-margined. 

 No hinder marginal line ; the cilia opposite the last dorsal spot blackish, and 

 the wing beneath the last costal spot golden-brown. Hind wings pale brown- 

 ish gray, cilia the same. 



The larva may be found in the leaf of Desmodium viridiflorumin July 

 and early in August ; it mines the under surface, usually near the margin, which 

 is more or less folded, and the separated epidermis brown and hairy. I have 

 no description of the larva. It becomes a pupa during the latter part of August, 

 and is suspended within the mine in a very slight web of silk. The perfect 

 insect is the smallest of this group that has come under my observation. 



4. L. iEriferella. Antennse dark brown above, white beneath. Front 

 silvery white ; tuft dark brown. Fore wings pale reddish-saffron with a golden 

 hue, especially from the middle to the base, with four silvery costal streaks, 

 the first on the middle of the costa, and all except the last black-margined to- 

 ward the base, the third but faintly, and the costa black from the base to the 

 first costal streak. Three silvery dorsal streaks on the inner margin, the first 

 two large and the third small, the first black-margined internally and around 

 the tip behind, the second by a line curved above. Apical spot small and 

 black, with the scales behind it having a bluish splendent lustre ; hinder mar- 

 ginal line blackish ; cilia dark grayish, with a fulvous hue. Hind wings dark 

 gray, cilia fulvous. 



The larva may be found in the leaves of oaks in September and early in Octo- 



[Nov.

ber. It makes a small mine on the under surface, and the leaf is thrown into a fold 

 previously to pupation and the cuticles folded and corrugated. The pupa is 

 contained in an ovoid cocoon within the mine, composed of " frass " and silk. 

 The imago appears in May. The body of the larva is cylindrical. The head is 

 pale brown; the body yellow, with a broad, vascular, reddish brown band. 

 There is doubtless a spring brood, but I have not searched for the larva during 

 the season. 



5. L. basistrigell a. Antenna? silvery. Front silvery, tuft fulvous mixed 

 with silvery. Thorax pale, reddish golden, with a white streak on each side 

 and one in the middle. Fore wings shining ochreous saffron, with a slender, 

 unmargined white basal streak in the fold, a white basal streak along the costa, 

 narrowly dark margined on the extreme costa, extended to the first costal 

 streak, which is silvery white, very oblique and unmargined ; behind this are 

 three small costal streaks of the same hue, the two central dark-margined in- 

 ternally. Opposite the first costal streak is a long, very oblique, silvery white 

 dorsal streak, extended along the inner margin to the base, with dark brown 

 scales between their hinder ends, or exterior to the tip of the dorsal streak, bxit 

 sometimes absent. Nearly opposite the third costal streak is a dorsal silvery 

 streak dark-margined internally. No apical spot, sometimes with dispersed 

 dark brown scales beneath the last costal spot. The hinder marginal line 

 blackish ; cilia pale fulvous. Posterior wings gray, cilia gray with a fulvous 

 hue. 



The larva mines the under side of the leaves of oaks ; I have usually found it 

 in the leaf of the chestnut oak, in September. The mine is limited by two veins 

 of the leaf, and when completed the external epidermis is left transparent. The 

 " frass " is cast on the margins of the mine, and when the larva is prepared to 

 enter the pupa state it collects the grains of " frass " and makes an oval outline 

 of them within the mine, or wall to its cocoon, leaving the cuticles transparent, 

 so that the pupa can be seen within. The imago appears early in May. The 

 body of the larva is cylindrical. It is lemon-yellow along the dorsum, except 

 the three anterior wings, which are whitish, with a series of dark brownish dorsal 

 dashes beginning on the third ring ; on the eighth ring, in some specimens, is a 

 dorsal reddish orange patch. Head whitish, tinged with pale brown. 



6. L. ar g e n t if i m b r ie 1 la. Antenna? silvery, annulated with darkish 

 brown. Head, front and thorax silvery white. Anterior wings silvery, pale 

 golden from nearly the middle to the tip, with a long basal dark brown streak 

 margined above with golden, extending nearly to the first costal streak. There 

 are four silvery costal streaks all dark-margined, the first very oblique, the 

 second convex toward the base of the wing. The first costal dark margin is 

 decided and extended on the costa toward the base. Two silvery dark-margined 

 dorsal streaks, the first opposite the second costal streak. The apical spot 

 black ; hinder-marginal line dark brown, cilia silver gray. Hind wings silver 

 gray, cilia the same. 



Found in the pupa state in the same leaf as the foregoing in the latter part 

 of September. The pupa is suspended within the mine in a very thin silken 

 web. The perfect insect appears early in May. 



7. L. o b s c ur ic o s t e 1 1 a. Head and frontal tuft silvery. Thorax very 

 pale golden. Fore wings pale golden, with a silvery median stripe from the 

 base, black-margined toward the costa, extending to the middle of the wing ; with 

 four silvery costal streaks, the first very oblique and rather long, and all except 

 the last black-margined internally, the margin of the first being long and the 

 continuation of a black streak from the base along the extreme costa. Three, 

 silvery dorsal streaks, the first quite long, obliquely curved and opposite the 

 first costal streak, and the first two black-margined internally ; the second dorsal 

 obliquely opposite the third costal streak. Apical spot black ; hinder-marginal line 

 black, cilia grayish. Hind wings bluish gray, cilia the same. Abdomen black, 

 tipped freely toith yellow.

322 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



The larva mines the leaf of Ostrya Virginica (hop-hornbeam) in Sep- 

 tember. I have no description of the larva, supposing at the time of capture it 

 was the same as the succeeding species. The pupa was not contained in an 

 ovoid cocoon made of "frass " and silk. The imago appears in May. 



8. L. Os try aefol ie'll a. Antennae silvery. Front silvery, tuft fuscous 

 and silvery mixed. Thorax silvery, with the basal part of tegulae pale golden. 

 Fore wings pale golden, with an unmargined, median, silvery basal stripe, and a 

 silvery streak along the basalportion of the inner margin. Fore wings pale golden, 

 with four silvery costal streaks, all except the last black-margined internally ; 

 with two dorsal streaks of the same hue, black-margined internally. The first 

 costal and first dorsal streaks opposite, quite oblique and broad at their bases, 

 the second dorsal opposite the second costal streak. The basal streak is moderately 

 broad, and extends quite to the middle of the wing. Apical spot black: hinder- 

 marginal line blackish ; cilia fulvous gray. Hind wings gray, cilia fulvous 

 gray. Abdomen pale fulvous. 



The larva mines the under side of the leaves of Ostrya, and may be found 

 early in July and October. The mine is usually near the margin of the leaf, is 

 flat at first, but is gradually thrown into a fold, the separated epidermis cor- 

 rugated. When completed, the epidermis has changed to a pale brown color. 

 The larva undergoes its transformation in a cocoon composed of "fras3" and 

 silk, in the form of a small ovoid ball suspended within the mine. The larva 

 is cylindrical, with the body pale yellow, colored on the dorsum beyond the 

 third segment, dark green from ingesta. The imago appears in August and 

 May. 



In the same leaf, mining the upper surface in a blotch mine, at first white and 

 subsequently brown, may be found in October a Litbocolletis larva of a different 

 type from the a6ove. It tapers posteriorly, is flattened above and beneath, 

 with the rings distinctly separated and mammillated at the sides ; the first ring 

 is rather abrupt anteriorly and much broader than the head. The head is some- 

 what triangular, flattened and thin, with the mandibles projecting in front as 

 two small, rounded appendages. The head is pale brown, the body of the same 

 hue, with dorsal, dark brown, elliptical maculae, placed transversely on the 

 segments. I have not seen the imago, and refrain from naming the species, lest 

 it may be identical with some one hereafater described. The cocoon is circular, 

 its outline being visible on the upper epidermis as a circle, while beneath it is 

 raised and prominent. 



9. L. lucetiella. Antennae silvery. Head, tuft and thorax silvery. 

 Anterior wings silvery from the base to the middle, and thence to the tip golden, 

 with a golden costal streak from the base not extended to the middle. About 

 the middle of the wing is a silvery band, broadly margined internally with 

 golden, and with a minute black point on the costa internally ; a costal silvery 

 spot, margined internally by a black spot, nearly opposite to which is a large 

 dorsal silvery streak margined internally by an oblique black line ; near the tip 

 is a costal, silvery, unmargined streak curving to the tip ; cilia golden, at the 

 tip and on inner margin silvery. No apical spot nor hinder-marginal line. 

 Hind wings silver gray, cilia the same. Abdomen blackish, tipped with silvery 

 gray. 



The larva mines the underside of the leaf of Tilia Americana (bass 

 wood) in July, September and October. The mine is most frequently nearly 

 square in form, and when completed both cuticles of the leaf are left nearly 

 transparent, and the leaf is not folded. The " frass " is cast on the edges of 

 the mine. It weaves an oval cocoon, thin enough, however, to permit the pupa 

 to be seen through the cuticles. The larva is cylindrical. The head pale brown ; 

 the body pale greenish white, with a series of dorsal brown spots from the third 

 ring posteriorly. The imago appears in August and May. 



10. L. o b st r ic te 1 1 a. Antennae silvery beneath, blackish above, with

a whitish band near the tip. Front silvery, with a reddish tinge on the fore- 

 head. Tuft and thorax reddish orange. Fore wings deep reddish orange, with 

 three silvery bands black-margined exteriorly, one beyond the middle toward 

 the base, one about the middle and one near the tip. A large black apical spot, 

 with a few silvery scales or minute spots; hinder-marginal line dark brown, 

 cilia reddish orange. Hind wings blackish, cilia blackish brown. Abdomen 

 black. 



The larva mines the under surface of oak leaves, in September. I did not 

 open the mines of the specimens I secured as I had but two. The larva was 

 cylindrical, and through the unruptured cuticle appeared to be of a lemon yellow 

 color. The pupa was contaiued in a very slight web within the mine. The 

 imago appeared in May. The larvae which I secured were taken in the leaves 

 of the black oak on September 23d. 



11. L. C a ry aef o 1 i e 11 a. Antenna? silvery, annulated with blackish. 

 Front silvery. Tuft and thorax reddish orange. Fore wings reddish orange, 

 with three silvery bands, black-margined exteriorly, the second about the 

 middle of the wing, angulated, with the black margin broad and produced pos- 

 teriorly on a whitish ground, nearly to the third, which is somewhat inter- 

 rupted in the middle ; the first midway between the second and base of the 

 wing and also angulated near the costa. The apical portion of the wing white, 

 covered with dispersed black scales, with a few black scales on a whitish 

 ground, on the costa, between the last silvery band the dusted apical portion ; 

 with two hinder-marginal lines, one the margin of the apical scales, the 

 other a dark brownish line in the cilia. Hind wings pale brownish gray, cilia 

 gray, with a fulvous hue. 



The larva mines the upper side of the leaves of the hickory tree in June, 

 July and September, making a white blotch, or an irregular, rather broad 

 tract when there is but one in the leaf ; and not throwing the leaf into a fold. 

 Frequently there are several larvae in a leaf, in one instance I counted twelve. 

 The ' ' frass ' ' is deposited along the middle of the mine. The larva is flattened, 

 and its physical charactei'istics are similar to those of the second larval group. 

 The head is very light brown ; the body dark lead color, becoming yellowish 

 posteriorly, with the mammillae of the thoracic rings yellowish, and a central 

 spot of the same hue on the first ; each ring on the dorsum with a dark brown, 

 shining macula, those on thoracic rings trapezoidal, the remainder oval ; on 

 the ventral surface the maculae are also dark brown, those on the fourth and 

 fifth rings being oval. The perfect insects of the spring brood appear in Au- 

 gust ; from the fall brood I did not succeed in rearing the imago. 



12. L. aceriella . Front silvery, tuft reddish orange and silvery mixed. 

 Thorax reddish orange. Fore wings reddish orange, somewhat metallic, with 

 a white streak black-margined exteriorly, from the inner basal angle to the 

 fold; with two oblique, silvery bands black-margined behind, one about the 

 middle of the wing and the other midway between it and the base of the 

 wing. Near the tip is a costal silvery spot, black-margined behind, with an 

 opposite, oblique, dorsal streak of the same hue, likewise black-margined be- 

 hind, and an oblique, costal, silvery streak continued on the line of the last 

 dorsal, running into the cilia just before the tip, black-margined above, at the 

 tip before, and below at the tip behind ; scarcely with a hinder-marginal line, 

 cilia of the general hue. Hind wings plumbeous, cilia with a fulvous hue. 



The larva mines the leaf of maple in September. It mines the upper sur- 

 face of the leaf, making a flat, rather broad tract, casting its ' ' frass ' ' along 

 the middle of the course of it. Physical characteristics those of the second 

 larval group. Head pale brown ; body yellowish green, with oval, dorsal, 

 brown maculae, darkest on threir margins ; thoracic rings on their sides pale 

 yellowish. The cocoon is circular. The larva is likewise found in the leaf 

 ofHamamelis Virginica (witch-hazel).

324 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



I have two or three other specimens which appear to unite the specific 

 characters of the present and succeeding species, and I therefore decline to 

 describe them until I have conducted more careful observations on their em- 

 bryonic histories than I have instituted at present. 



13. L. guttifinitella. Front silvery, with a reddish hue. Tuft and 

 thorax reddish orange. Antennae blackish brown. Fore wings rather deep 

 reddish orange, with two silvery bands black-margined behind, one in the 

 middle of the wing and nearly straight, the other midway between this and 

 the base of the wing and obliquely placed. Before ' the costo-apical cilia is a 

 costal, silvery spot, black-margined on both sides, with an opposite dorsal 

 spot, black-margined behind. The apical portion of the wing is dusted with 

 blackish, dispersed scales with a white spot Dear the tip above the middle of 

 the wing. There are two hinder-marginal lines, one the margin of the dis- 

 persed scales, the other dark brownish in the cilia. 



The larva may be taken in August and September in the leaf of Rhus toxi- 

 codendron (Poison Oak) mining the upper surface in a rather broad, 

 tortuous tract, and there are ordinarily several in the same leaf. The larva 

 belongs to the second larval group. The head is a fine pale brown ; the body 

 yellowish posteriorly, becoming brownish above, with dorsal and ventral dark 

 brown maculae. The cocoon is circular, formed within the mine as usual in 

 this group in a little circular depression. 



It is probably unnecessary to caution the collector to be careful in hand- 

 ling the leaves of the food-plant of this larva ; to many persons they are 

 poisonous, producing a very disagreeable and uncomfortable eruption. I was 

 affected by it when I first collected this species, and would advise all others to 

 handle the food-plant " with gloves." 



14. L. cratsegella . Antennae, front and tuft dark silvery gray. Fore 

 wings rather deep brownish golden, with a broad silvery basal streak, black- 

 margined toward the costa, extended to the tegulae in front and pointed be- 

 hind, with the point black-margined on both sides and with the costa black. 

 Four costal silvery streaks, the first oblique but rounded beneath and black- 

 margined on both sides, the others toward the base alone. Three silvery 

 dorsal streaks, the first rather broad, oblique, nearly touching the first costal, 

 and black-margined on both sides as also the second ; the third only toward 

 the base. A streak of black scales in the middle of the wing at the apex, 

 extended backwards between the streaks to the second dorsal and costal. 

 Hinder-marginal line blackish, with a violet metallic hue ; cilia dark fulvous. 



The larva mines the underside of black thorn during September and Octo- 

 ber. The mine is usually limited by two veins of the leaf. The larva is cy- 

 lindrical, with a very pale brown head ; the body yellowish, colored dark 

 green by the ingesta. The imago appears in April and May. 



15. L. hamadr y adella. Front, tuft and thorax white. Antenna; 

 white, annulated above with blackish. Fore wings white, with an angulated, 

 shining, ochreous saffron band, rather behind the basal third of the wing, 

 black-margined internally with dispersed scales ; a broad angulated band of 

 the same hue, behind the middle, black-margined internally with dispersed 

 black scales, produced in the middle, so as to divide it into two portions, with 

 the space between the bands somewhat suffused behind the second with ochre- 

 ous saffron, and an irregular line of blackish dispersed scales through the 

 middle of it. Near the tip is a costal and dorsal ochreous saffron spot, with the 

 white space between these and the second band dusted with blackish, with 

 the apical portion white, dusted with black scales, and connected with the 

 patch before it by a line separating the costal and dorsal spots. The basal 

 portion of the wing somewhat dusted with black, with a small blackish patch 

 on costa near the base and two small, faint saffron patches beyond it. The 

 hinder-marginal line blackish, cilia with a fulvous hue. Hind wings rather 

 dark silvery gray, cilia with a fulvous hue.

Variation F. 

 The first ochreous saffron band interrupted in the middle, with a broad in- 

 ternal margin of scattered scales, produced behind in the middle ; the second 

 somewhat diffuse, with the irrorated portion of the wing spreading out behind 

 from the produced part of its black-margin. 



Variation GL 



With an angulated line of blackish scales before the first band and an ochre- 

 ous saffron patch between its angle and that of the black-margin of the first 

 band. 



The larva mines the upper side of the leaves of oaks in July. The head is 

 black, the body pale yellowish, with an ochre yellow patch on the dorsum of 

 the eighth segment, a dark vascular line and a few dark subdorsal spots pos- 

 teriorly. The imago appears early in August. The variations F and G were 

 specimens found in the pupa state. 



16. L. argentinotella . Antennae silvery. Front and tuft silvery. 

 Thorax pale reddish saffron, with a rather short, unmarginal, silvery basal 

 streak, with Jive costal silvery streaks and/our dorsal streaks of the same hue. 

 The first costal and dorsal streaks unmargined, the first dorsal being near the 

 inner angle of the base, tapering to a point in the middle of the wing from a 

 very broad base ; the first costal streak rather slender and only one-half as 

 long as the first dorsal ; the second costal and second dorsal connected about 

 the middle of the wing, and dark-margined toward the base by a line much 

 curved in the middle ; the third costal and third dorsal opposite, and each 

 dark-margined internally ; the fourth dorsal about midway between the fourth 

 and fifth costal streaks ; sometimes the fourth costal and dorsal streaks with 

 a few dark internal scales, sometimes unmargined. At the apex is a small 

 patch of scattered black scales ; the hinder-marginal line rather indistinct, 

 cilia saffron, paler on inner margin. Hind wings shining silver gray, cilia 

 rather darker. 



I am unable to give any account of this species. The specimens were un- 

 marked by any number referring to my notes, and I suppose I must have 

 mistaken it for some other, as I did not observe its peculiar markings until I 

 came to write the present paper. I hope, however, to supply its larval history 

 next season, now that the species thus far met with are tabulated in a manner 

 which will facilitate recognition. 



The following genus belongs, in the arrangement of European systematists, 

 to the family Elachistidae. I do not think any argument necessary to prove 

 that it is a natural portion of Lithocolletidse, which is usually regarded as be- 

 ing composed of a single genus. 



Tischeria Zeller. 



Head with a rather erect frontal tuft of scales ; the front smooth, narrow 

 and but little inclined. Oeelli none. Eyes rather salient, naked and not 

 covered with scales in front. Antennae scarcely more than one-half so long 

 as the anterior wing, with rather long pilose dilations beneath in the (j\ simple 

 in the $, with the basal joint tufted in front. Maxillary palpi very short and 

 scarcely perceptible. Labial palpi short, filiform and drooping. Tongue scaled, 

 as long as the anterior coxa?. 



The wings with long cilia ; the anterior pointed almost caudate, the poste- 

 rior lanceolate. The discoidal cell of the anterior not pointed, closed in front 

 by a very faint nervure, and with . a faintly indicated secondary cell, beyond 

 which the subcostal nervure is almost obsolete. The subcostal nervure sends 

 four veins to the costa, the first of which is rather long and arises near the 

 basal third of the wing ; the discal emits a simple vein to the costa above the 

 tip and one to the inner margin beneath. The median nervure send two veins 

 to the inner margin near the tip. The submedian is simple.

The head of the larva is circular in outline, thin, flat and nearly as broad as 

 the first ring. The body tapers much posteriorly, is subcylindrical andmonili- 

 form, with the anterior rings slightly dilated, with the segments rounded and 

 distinct at the sides ; with three thoracic feet, four abdominal and one ter- 

 minal pair, all of which are extremely short and are scarcely more than cup- 

 like depressions. 



The mine is usually made, if not always, near the margin of the leaf which, 

 in this case is folded and curled so as almost to conceal the separated epider- 

 mis when completed, although in the beginning it is nearly flat. It contains 

 no "frass," and an examination of the under surface reveals the presence of 

 minute, round holes, through which the larva ejects its excrement. The 

 pupa is contained within the mine, generally not in a cocoon, but the mine is 

 carpeted throughout with silk, thus closing Up the holes in the lower surface. 

 The pupa case is thrust from the mine at maturity. 



The imago reposes with its head elevated and the tips of the wings touching 

 the surface on which it rests. The antennae are thrown back beneath the 

 wings, the anterior legs folded on the breast, the insect sustaining itself by 

 means of the middle and posterior legs.

 Solidagonifoliella; yellowish, slightly tinted with fuscous. 

 Fore wings immaculate. 

 Hind wings concolorous. 

 Zelleriella, yellowish, with reddish saffron at the tip. 

 Female ? the entire insect reddish ferruginous. 



Hind wings with a fuscous patch near the base. 

 Citrinipennella, bright yellow, reddish ferruginous at tip. 



T. solidagonifoliella . Head, thorax and antennae pale yellowish. 

 Fore wings yellowish, somewhat tinted with fuscous, with a short line of 

 black atoms along the middle of the inner margin, two small patches or much 

 scattered, isolated black atoms toward the base of the wing, a patch near the 

 tip on the inner margin, with a minute patch or a few isolated atoms on the 

 costa between the line and patch on inner margin ; at the tip are a few 

 isolated atoms. Hind wings very pale yellowish, cilia the same. The male 

 described. 



Found in the pupa state August 1st in the leaf of a species of Solidago. The 

 mine was on the upper surface and the leaf not folded. The pupa was con- 

 tained in a slight circular cocoon, attached to the upper cuticle, which formed 

 its upper walls. On August 9th the imago appeared, the pupa case having 

 been thrust through the under side of the leaf. 



T. Zelleriella . Antennae, head and thorax pale yellow. Fore wings 

 yellowish, with reddish saffron along the middle and toward the tip ; cilia red- 

 dish saffron, pale yellow on the inner margin. Hind wings bluish gray, tinted 

 with yellow externally toward the tip, cilia yellow on the exterior margin toward 

 the tip, internally pale yellowish gray. 



Female ? The head, thorax and fore wings yellowish, suffused with reddish 

 ferruginous, darkest toward the tip. Hind wings dark gray. 



The larva mines the leaves of oaks- in September, making at first a white 

 blotch on the upper surface, but subsequently the upper epidermis becomes 

 brown and the margin of the leaf curled. The head is dark brown ; the body 

 yellowish, with the dorsum of the first segment blackish, with two lateral 

 minute pale spots; a vascular dark green line. The imago appears early 

 in May, and there is, therefore, a spring brood. 



T. citrinipennella . Antennae pale fuscous : head and thorax yel- 

 lowish, tinted with reddish saffron. Fore wings bright yellow from the base

nearly to the tip ; apical portion reddish ferruginous. Hind wings dark gray, 

 with a fuscous patch near the base ; cilia pale fuscous. The niiile described. 



There is but little difference between this and the foregoiug species, either 

 in the perfect or larval state. The larva mines the upper surface of oak leaves, 

 in September. The head is dark brown ; the body yellowish green, with a 

 a double dark brown macula on the dorsum of the first ring ; vascular line 

 very narrow and dark green. A more careful observation than I have given 

 these insects may prove them to be the same, or the latter a variation. I have 

 but a few of each of them. The imago appears early in May, and a spring 

 brood will be found in early summer. 



Phyllocnistis Zeller. 



Head smooth, elongated above and clothed with imbricated scales. Front 

 with scales closely appressed, slightly retreating and broad at the clipeus. 

 Forehead or vertex, globosely rounded. Ocelli none. Eyes scarcely visible 

 in front and partially covered with scales. Antennae simple, one-third less 

 long than the anterior wings : basal joint scarcely with an eye-cap, somewhat 

 enlarged and flattened, but smooth and squamose. Maxillary palpi none. 

 Labial palpi very slender, and drooping (in the living insect they are ascend- 

 ing). Tongue very slender, naked and scarcely as long as the anterior coxae. 



The anterior wings almost caudate, the posterior lanceolate. In the 

 anterior wings the discoidal cell is acute behind ; the subcostal nervure sends 

 three short branches to the costa, and from the apex of the discoidal cell arises 

 a "branch furcate behind the tip, one of the nervulets proceeding to the costa 

 before the tip, the other to the inner margin. The median nervure sends two 

 approximated veins to the inner margin near the tip. In the posterior wings 

 the subdorsal is simple, ending in the tip, the median furcate near its mar- 

 ginal extremity. 



The head of the larva is thin, flat and circular, with the mandibles forming 

 an appendage in front on the median line similiar to some of the lithocolletes 

 larva?. The body tapers somewhat posteriorly with the sides of the segments 

 slightly projecting and flattened, with the general form rather cylindrical. 

 It is without feet or prolegs, and is very inactive, making little or no voluntary 

 movement when removed from the mine, and does not retreat in its mine 

 when touched. The body is somewhat viscid. 



The mine is a linear tract just wide enough to accommodate the body, long 

 and winding. The larva does not consume all the parenchyma of the leaf 

 along its tract, but simply separates the upper epidermis, so that it is not 

 transparent. When full grown the end of the mine is enlarged and the cocoon 

 woven in a little pucker of the leaf within the mine. 



The perfect insect is very sluggish, at rest carrying its antennae thrown back- 

 ward, but arched somewhat above the dorsal surface. 



P. vitegenella . Antenna? brownish silvery, fuscous at the tip. Head 

 and thorax silvery white. Fore wings silvery white, slightly golden toward 

 the tip, with a blackish dorsal patch on the inner margin near the base. 

 Somewhat behind the middle of the wing is a black oblique costal streak and 

 a black line curving from the costa to the inner margin. At the tip is a circu- 

 lar black spot, and before it on the costa two short, straight, black streaks. 

 At the extreme tip of the wing are two blackish, diverging streaks in the cilia, 

 with one of the same hue in the cilia beneath the apical spot nearly joining a 

 black hinder-marginal line ; cilia silvery. Hind wings silvery, cilia the same. 



The larva mines the upper side of the leaf of Vitia cordifolia and per- 

 haps other species, in September and October. The imago appears in Sep- 

 tember. 



Leucaothiza. 



Bead slightly hairy above on the vertex. The front smooth, covered with 

 closely appressed scales, broad, even beneath and somewhat inclined. The 



1859.] 24 




328 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY 01 



forehead or vertex rather acutely rounded above or ridge-like. Ocelli none. 

 The eyes scarcely visible in front, partially concealed by scales. Antennae 

 wimple, nearly or quite as long as the anterior wings, the basal joint squamose 

 and but little larger than the stalk. Maxillary palpi none. Labial palpi 

 very slender and drooping. Tongue naked, as long as anterior coxae. 



The fore wings are almost caudate at the tip ; the posterior lanceolate. The 

 liscoidal cell of the fore wings is acute, behind, with two veins emitted at its 

 point, one to the costa before the tip the other to the inner margin. The sub- 

 costal nervure sends three short veins to the costa and the median two ap- 

 proximated veins to the inner margin. In the hind wings the subcostal and 

 median are both simple, and the latter extended to the tip. 



The head of the larva is very thin and flat, with projecting mandibles in 

 ii'ont. The body is much flattened, tapering anteriorly and posteriorly, the 

 rings separated by rather deep incisions and their ends on the sides mammil- 

 iated, the rings themselves being rather elongated ellipsoids. The thoracic feet 

 are three and mere mammillae ; the abdominal three, but their appearance not 

 very distinct, and a terminal pair. The larva approaches that of the second 

 group of Lithocolletis very closely. 



The mine is a conspicuous white blotch on the upper surface, generally oc- 

 cupying the greater portion of the leaf, aud sometimes when two are present, 

 in the same leaf, the whole of it. A day or two previously to undergoing their 

 last molting, the larva cease to eat, and at the end of that time leaving its 

 cast" within the mine abandons it to construct a white silken cocoon. 

 which is woven on some substance on the surface of the ground. 



The perfect insect holds the antennas extended at the sides when at rest. 

 and moves them with a rotatory motion during progression. 



L. amphicarpeaefoliell a. Head golden, with fuliginous hairs above. 

 Antennae golden brown, with the tips silvery white. Thorax golden, fuligi- 

 nous in front, and abdomen golden brown. Fore wings deep orange yellow, 

 with the apical portion dark golden brown and a fuliginous or deep brown 

 patch occupying the basal part of the wing, bordered broadly behind by a cir- 

 cular golden streak, extending from the costa to the inner border at the basal 

 angle. A very oblique somewhat curved golden streak, dark-margined on both 

 hides, extends from the basal third of the wing near the costa, to the middle 

 of the costa. A large golden patch, dark-margined above, extends from the 

 inner angle to the middle of the wing, with the inner margin between it and 

 the circular basal streak dark golden brown. At the beginning of the costal 

 cilia is a golden dorsal streak ; cilia dark brown, in certain lights golden brown. 

 Hind wing dark gray, cilia the same. 



The larva makes a conspicuous white blotch mine on the upper surface of 

 the leaf of Amphicarpcea monoicu (hog pea-nut) from August to October. The 

 head is pale brown ; the body pale green, with brownish maculae along the 

 dorsum, aud round dark brown spots on the ventral surface ; the ends of the 

 first ring on the sides are yellowish. After the last molting the body is uni- 

 form dark green, the "cast " with dorsal maculae being left within the mine. 

 The .imago appears about the middle of May. This insect is one of the most 

 beautiful I have met with.

Mr. Lea, President in the Chair. 



Thirty-nine members present. 



Br. Fisher presented for publication an index of the genera described 

 or referred to in the Proceedings of the Academy, vol. i. viii., which 

 was referred to the Committee on Proceedings, with power to act. 



A paper was presented for publication in the Proceedings, entitled, 

 " Descriptions of Three New Species of Exotic Uniones, by Isaac Lea," 

 and was referred to a committee. 



Mr. Lea exhibited a specimen of Unio subrotundus, Lea, from White River, 

 Indiana, and observed that he had in May, 1836, called the attention of the 

 members to a female specimen of Unio multiplicatus, Lea, which had both lobes 

 of the branchia on both sides charged with embryonic shells. In the following 

 June, he exhibited a fine female, U. rubiginosus, Lea, also with the four lobes 

 charged. This species differed from the former in having red ova, which were 

 quite intense in color, resembling arterial blood. In July, 1859, he called at- 

 tention to a third species, U. Kleinianus, Lea, from Georgia, which had " a 

 branchial uterus in both lobes of the branchia on each side." These specimens were 

 in alcohol, and if the ova were red when living, it was not observable in those. 

 The specimens of subrotundus now exhibited, prove this species to be possessed 

 of branchial uteri in the four lobes of the branchia, and, also, that the ova are red, 

 like rubiginosus. Therefore, we now know of four species which have this 

 remarkable provision of a branchial uterus in each lobe or leaf of the branchia, 

 viz: 



Unio multiplicatus, 



Unio rubiginosus, 



Unio Kleinianus, 



Unio subrotundus, 



and of these, two at least have the very remarkable condition of redness of the 

 ova ; viz : 



Unio rubiginosus, 

 Unio subrotundus. 



It is a fact not less interesting, that the spermatic fluid of the male was found 

 in the glandular flattened lobules, also to be red, but the color did not appear 

 to be so intense as that in the ova of the female. Whether the males of other 

 species, the females of which have red ova, will be found to have red spermatic 

 fluid, remains for future investigation and observation. 



That other species will be found to have uteri in the four lobes of the bran- 

 chia he had little doubt, and that red ova would be found to characterise other 

 species is also probable. The coordination of the four species, as regards their 

 four branchial uteri, is very remarkable, and it is the more striking, as they 

 appear from their shelly covering their exo-skeleton to belong to groups yery 

 different in the structure of this part. The U. multiplicatus, and U. Kleinianus, 

 are both plicate; the former is the largest of the genus Unio known, and the 

 latter is among the smallest. The U. rubiginosus and U. subrotundus are smooth, 

 without any appearance of folds, and in their outline are different from the '.wo 

 former, and they also differ much, one from the other. In the four specie3 there 

 is such a marked difference in the shelly covering, as to cause the species to be 

 recognized at once as to their distinct normal forms. 



It has always been a difficulty, in the examination of alcoholic specimens, to 

 make exact and satisfactory differences in some of the soft parts, and these may 

 often be erroneously described where color or delicate organs and processes are 

 involved in the discussion of their characteristics. These difficulties can only 

 be avoided where the specimens can be examined in a living state, where all

the parts are in a normal condition. It is. therefore, greatly to he desired 

 that zoologists in our different zoological districts would give attention to the 

 anatomical structure of the species which inhabit their own districts. Eventually, 

 in this way, there may be built up a correct knowledge of the habits and anatomy 

 of this interesting family, of which we have a somewhat comparatively correct 

 diagnosis of the exo-skeleton. 



Mr. Lea also mentioned that, in connexion with this subject, he had paid 

 much attention to the power of vision in the family Unionidte, since his com- 

 munication on the subject, in February, 1857. He found the following species 

 always to close the anal opening, and to withdraw the papillae of the branchial 

 opening when the light was suddenly intercepted, viz : 



Unio cylindricus, Say. 



Unio rubiginosus, Lea. 



Unio subrotundus, Lea. 



Unio pyramidatus, Lea.

Unio pustulosus, Lea. ,

have scarcely any species in common with the shells of San Diego, while in 

 general they agree with those of the West American tropical fanna. They are 

 more nearly related to those of Acapulc6 and Panama than to those of Mazat- 

 lan, although in the same latitude on the opposite side of the Gulf. The 

 presence of such shells as Oniscia tuberculosa, Cassis coarctata and abbreviata, 

 Lathirus castaneus, Oliva porphyria, Columbella hcemastoma, Conus princeps, &c, 

 Several of which are also found at Guaymas, though not at Mazatlan, distinctly 

 points to far more tropical conditions than could have been expected in so 

 high a latitude. The Trochidce, Patellidce, and similar intertidal families, 

 however, bear more near relationship to the shells of Mazatlan; while a. soli- 

 tary, though fine and apparently fresh specimen of Haliotis splendens, entirely 

 unknown in the Gulf, serves as a connecting link to the fauna of Lower Cali- 

 fornia.

 Sciences of Philadelphia, with notes on the families, genera and species. 



r>Y E. D. COPE. 



In the cephalic vertebra of the typical venomous serpents, we observe the 

 greatest modifications of the archetypal vertebra, in the ophidian order. This, 

 which is most excessive in the inferior arches, consists in 



First, the great shortening and thickening of the haemapophysial element 

 of the nasal vertebra, (superior maxillary,) to serve as a firm foundation for 

 the long curved venom fangs. 



Second, its ginglymoid articulation with its neurapophysis (prefrontal), by 

 motion, upon which the fangs are erected or depressed, and 



Third, the great lengthening of the pleurapophysial element of the frontal 

 vertebra, (the tympanic bone), which, acting as a fulcrum, gives the greatest 

 mobility to the articulated pterygoid appendage, the ectopterygoid, and conse- 

 quently to the superior maxillary. 



Thus, it is evident that this modification has immediate reference to the 

 complete specialization, and more perfect exercise of natural functions, the 

 apprehension of living prey, and its subsequent deglutition. 



From the possession of these attributes of high organization, we infer that 

 nature has assigned to the typical venomous serpents the first place in the 

 category of ophidians. 



Hence, also, in attempting to define them as a natural group, we look to 

 those points of structure whence we deduce the evidence of superiority. 



In the Colubriform venomous serpents, the hsemapophysis of the nasal 

 vertebra still falls considerably short of its hsemal spine, and is much thick- 

 ened in a vertical direction at its distal end, to give a firm support to the 

 fangs. But a tendency to revert to the ordinary ophidian type is seen in its 

 posterior elongation, its oblique articulation with the shortened ectopterygoid 

 appendage, and its imperfect articulation with the neurapophysis. In conse- 

 quence of this structure, the external pterygoid muscle plays upon the 

 maxillary bone at a disadvantage, having, in point of fact, but little power to 

 effect the depression of the fangs. The pleurapophysis of the mandibular arch 

 is shortened. The result of this is, that the pterygoid, articulated to a shorter 

 fulcrum, cannot be drawn forward by the spheno-pterygoid muscle to so great 

 an extent ; hence much less mobility is given to the dependent ectopterygoid 

 and superior maxillary. Of this group genus Naja, (Laur.) offers a typical 

 example ; of the first, Crotalus (Linn). 



Nowhere have we a more conclusive example of the futility of attempting 

 to define higher groups by external characters alone ; for, in respect to these, 

 the groups, in question, blend in a manner beyond the possibility of satis- 

 factory separation. There are, indeed, external peculiarities', which are highly 

 characteristic of each. On the one hand there are the depressed, scaly head ; 



[Dec. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



the perforate fangs ; the absence of solid maxillary teeth ; the elliptical pupil. 

 On the other, we observe the elevated, plated head ; fangs, which, in closing 

 round the poison duct, have not obliterated the line of junction ;* the pres- 

 ence of solid maxillary teeth, and the circular pupil. But in the first, many 

 genera have the head more or less completely plated ; Daboia (Gray) has 

 circular pupil. In the latter, Vermicella (Or.,) Elaps (L.,) Cyrtophis (Sund.. ) 

 and Sipedon (Merr.,) have no solid teeth behind the fangs; Dendraspis 

 (Schl.) has perforated fangs", and Acanthophis (Daud.) has the pupil erect 

 and elliptical. 



In recapitulation, we characterize as follows the families Viperidas and 

 Najidse, adopting the appellations given them by the Prince of Canino, whose 

 genius here perceived that order, "in tracing which the human mind is only 

 translating into human language, the Divine thoughts expressed in Nature in 

 living realities."! 



1. VirERIDJE. 



Essential char. Superior maxillary bone vertical by excessive abbreviatiou 

 anteriorly and posteriorly, supporting Venom fangs alone ; united to the an- 

 terior fiuuiiti aL its upper extremity, and to the ectopterygoid at the lower 

 extremity of its posterior face by ginglymoid articulations. Caudal vertebra-.- 

 normal, without greatly developed processes. 



Characters not universal. Tympanic bone much elongated, giving great 

 breadth to the head posteriorly. Fangs having all external trace of the en- 

 folded canal obliterated. Pupil erect, elliptical. Occipital region scaly. 



2. Najid.*:. 



Essential char. Superior maxillary bone horizontal, abbreviated and sup- 

 porting venom fangs anteriorly ; elongated posteriorly, and united to the 

 prefrontal and shortened ectopterygoid by imperfectly moveable articulations. 

 Caudal vertebra? normal, without greatly developed processes. 



Characters not universal. Tympanic bone shortened, causing the head to 

 be but little distinct from the body. Fangs not perfectly consolidated over the 

 canal. Pupil circular. Occipital region plated. 



These families correspond to the Solenoglyphes and ProteroglypL.es 

 Conocerques, of Dumeril and Bibron. Though the arrangement of these 

 eminent herpetologists is certainly, in this point, more natural than that 

 of the British Museum catalogue, where the Najidse (Elapsidse) are placed 

 among the Colubrine snakes ; yet it appears to us that they are in error in 

 not considering the sea-snakes, Proteroglyphis Platycerques, as constitut- 

 ing a group of equal rank with those above defined. They are characterized 

 by numerous external peculiarities, and the compression of the caudal vertebra?, 

 and unusual development of their neural and hajmal spines, constitute a 

 modification whose importance may be partly measured by its striking 

 adaptation to a special end in their economy.

Essential char. Superior maxillary bone horizontal, possessing very little 

 mobility ; abbreviated, and supporting a grooved fang anteriorly ; much 

 elongated posteriorly, and supporting a series of solid teeth. Caudal vertebra)

 port to the compressed, oar-like tail. Pupil round (?) 



Characters not universal. Head not dilated posteriorly; in consequence Of the 

 shortness of the tympanic bone. Body compressed ; scales not imbricated,

In the foetal Crotalus the gastrosteges are divided, but they unite into broad 

 shields some time before the young animal bursts its membrauous envelope. 

 But it is not until some size is attained that the grooved line where the grow- 

 ing edges of the fang unite and isolate the canal, is obliterated. 



Thus we see typified the three families of the venomous serpents, and their 

 relative positions in the scale of being. But these characters, while parallel

Those genera of serpents which are characterized by entire urosteges, ex- 

 hibit a degree of development one step beyond those that have them divided, 

 since the latter retain that arrangement which characterizes the foetal condi-

The confusion in the synonymy of some of the species of this genus is very 

 great, and is not diminished by the frequent reference of good species by Eu- 

 ropean herpetologists, as varieties of others previously described. Thus in the 



[Dec,

 to durissus (horridus,) and Prof. Jan, Rev. et. Mag. de Zoologie, 1859,. p.

The errors introduced into the synonymy of this species and the C. h o r r i - 

 dus of Linmeus, by Latreille and Daudin, and perpetuated by subsequent 

 writers, have been clearly set forth by Major J. Le Conte, Pro. Acad. Nat. Sci. 

 vol vi. p. 415. 



There are four specimens of this formidable serpent in the Acad. Museum, 

 which illustrate very well the changes which age produces in the plates on the 

 muzzle. 



No 141 hronwlit by Dr. Hering from Surinam, is a very ynnng individual^ 

 marked precisely as in Regne Animal Reptilia, pi. 32. There are three pairs 

 cf plates all closely in contact on the median line, the first subtriangular, the 

 second oval, the third lie partly between the superciliaries. 



No. 3. Surinam, Dr. Hering. This is 2 feet 7J inches long. The plates 

 are as in the preceding, except that the second pair are broader, and 

 concave. The head is rather narrow, resembling fig. 2, pi. 84 bis of the Erpe- 

 tologie Generale. This and the last belong to var. c of the Cat. Brit. Mus. 



No. 2. Head and tail of a very large individual, Vera Cruz, Dr. Burroughs, 

 the former measuring two inches between the angles of their jaws beneath. 

 Second pair of plates much elongated transversly with some, small scales be- 

 tween and around them ; of the third pair, one is divided, the other partially ; 

 and there are small scales between them and the superciliaries.

C- Lecontei was stated to differ from C. confluentus in possessing two 

 rows of scales between the suborbitals and superior labials instead of four ; in 

 having a row of four scales between the nasals instead of six ; in the less number 

 of longitudinal rows on the body, the absence of a white border to the rostral plate, 

 etc. Examination of the above specimens shows that the number of scales in 



1859.] 




338 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



the rows between the nasals varies from two to four in the first, from four to 

 six in the second ; that the number of rows of supralabials varies from two 

 to three ; the rows of scales on the body vary from 24 (the number attributed 

 to L e co n te i) to 26 ; that the rostral plate is often half bordered, sometimes 

 not at all.

The absence of a rattle distinguishes this genus from Crotalus, and the en- 

 tire urosteges from Bothrops. Its natural situation appears to be between 

 them. The two species which we have seen are both small and widely differ- 

 ent from each other.

Since the time of its description in 1847, this rare and curious serpent has been, 

 as far as we are aware, unnoticed by authors. As Berthold's description is brief, 

 we subjoin the following : 



Snout rounded, depressed, its plane forming an acute angle with that of the 

 rostral, which is slightly concave. Scales on the head tuberculous or carin- 

 ate, as are also the supralabials and temporals, the latter excessively. A series 

 of small tuberculous scales between the superciliary and orbit, two of which 

 are prolonged into compressed horn-like appendages, which are erect and flexi- 

 ble. Scales bordering the muzzle with their outer borders free and recurved. 

 Nasal plate large, the nostril pierced in the centre. Lachrymal fossa large. A 

 slender undivided subocular. Superior labials nine, the third longest ; eye 

 over third and fourth. Inferior labials thirteen. Geneial scales imbricate, 

 acute, some of them carinate. Scales of the body thin, acute, much imbricate, 

 in 24 or 25 longitudinal rows, all carinate except those next the gastrosteges.

No. 99. Bright green with a few dark brown rhombs on the back. On the pos- 

 terior part of the body, narrow pinkish grey bands, alternate on opposite sides 

 of the median line. The whole upper surface sparsely dotted with brown 

 punctulations. Upper surface of head with two deep brown spots on the 

 muzzle ; one on the inner border of each superciliary ; a large one on the 

 vertex, with a smaller confluent with it on each side, and two occipital spots. 

 A dark band passes from the orbit beyond the angle of the mouth. Inferior

Var. br achy stoma nob. In this variety the breadth of the head at the 

 angle of the jaws is only two-fifths its length, which is perhaps the result of 

 accident. The labials are 8 above and below, instead of 10 superior and 9 

 inferior. The brown spot on the head is quadrangular, not cordate ; and the 

 labials above and below, and the geneials, are brownish black. In other respects 

 it is exactly similar to the true Castelnaui. Longitudinal rows of scales 23.

T. L an s b erg i i is a third species of this genus. We have not been able 

 to find the' original description, but its prominent characters have been pointed 

 out by Prof. Jan, loc. cit. p. 155. T. nummifer, {Trig, nummifer Kiippel) 

 is probably a fourth species. There is a possibility, but we have not the means 

 at hand for arriving at a decision, that this is identical with Atropos mexi- 

 canus Dam. and Bibr. Vol. vii. p. 521, which has the urosteges entire, and, 

 according to the plate 83, bis. Erp. generale, a small superciliary shield. The 

 latter at least can hardly be considered as congeneric with the Atropos D a r w i n i

In No. 154 (large specimen), there is on the muzzle, below and in front of each

 the greater part of its length. In No. 155, (still larger specimen,) this scale is 

 produced into a horn, four lines in length. The scales of the head are more 

 strongly carinate and spinous in this than in' the last. InC. nasicornis 

 Gray, the horns are all developed from the supranasal plate, which is the 

 character by which Schlegel distinguishes it.

The gape and muzzle are shorter, and the latter more sloping than usual.

 Many specimens of this strongly-marked variety, and much observation on it 

 in a state of nature are needed to settle satisfactorily its true zoological value. 

 Until proof to the contrary can be adduced, we cannot consider it as more 

 than a variety. How far it coincides with the Coluber chersea of Linnseus

 one pair of frontal plates instead of two. 



In this genus the tympanic bone is short ; but in other respects the me- 

 chanism of the bones of the mouth is similar to that of the vipers and rattle- 

 snakes. The superior maxillary bone is very short and vertical, articulating 

 with the lachrymal by a ginglymoid joint at its superior extremity. Its whole 

 lower surface is occupied by the anchylosed bases of the fangs. The ecto- 

 pterygoid articulates with it moveably, and at a right angle, but is rather 

 short, and incurved posteriorly. While this structure gives its possessor the 

 power of erecting or depressing the fangs, weakness is indicated by the pro- 

 portions and form of the ectopterygoid and tympanic bones, and by the small 

 size of the spheno- and external pterygoid muscles. The former is hot larger 

 than in an adult Tropidonotus sirtalis. Though the gape of the mouth in 

 Dr. Hallowell's species is small, the fangs are probably as efficient as in some 

 species of Elaps, which, it has been shown by the experiments of Dr. Cantor, 

 are unable to inflict a wound on any but very small objects.

While this genus exhibits a close conformity to the succeeding group in ex- 

 ternal characters, it maintains that modification of the cephalic vertebrae which 

 we deem characteristic of the highest family of Ophidians, the' 'true venomous 

 serpents. 



Thus it is that, while this group (Viperidas) may be distinctly defined by 

 that modification of the ideal by which the neuro-skeletal structure is adapted 

 to an end in the economy of the animal, those external peculiarities which are 

 of no obvious value to their possessors connect it inseparably with that suc- 

 ceeding, and add another to the many proofs that the works of Creation form 

 a graduated and connected whole.

Superior maxillary bone elongated posteriorly, not compressed, rounded oa 

 its outer face ; the ectopterygoid curves inward and articulates with it ob- 

 liquely. The'fang is long, with a delicate groove on its anterior face, extend- 

 ing from the basal to the terminal orifice. Behind it there are two small 

 greatly recurved solid teeth, the last upon the very edge of the articulation 

 with the ectopterygoid, and both' are concealed by the integuments. 



In an undoubted and beautiful specimen of this snake, received from the 

 Garden of Plants, Paris, these characters are distinct. Hence we feel assured 

 that its true position is in the family Najidse, and that Pseudechis and Hoplo- 

 cephalus are its natural allies. Thus, while so large a proportion of Austra- 

 lia's mammals are Marsupials her birds, Raptores, Psittaci and Cursores ; 

 her mollusca, Braehiopods ; her lizards, Scinks* etc. her venomous serpents 

 are all Najida? ; nor has she a solitary example of the higher Viperidaa.

Rostral plate small. Anterior frontals very small; posterior frontals nearly 

 as broad as the length of the vertical, and a little longer than the superciliaries. 

 Vertical small, two-fifths of its length between the occipitals. Scales in fifteen 

 longitudinal rows. Rings black, three scales (in a straight line,) and three or 

 four gastrosteges in width. Spaces between, five or five and a half scales wide, 

 with a delicate light brown ground color, but divided by a vermillion ring, three 

 scales wide. This is wider on the belly and adjacent to the black, except when 

 occasionally separated by a yellow gastrostege. In the middle of the vermillion 

 is a series of elongate black spots one scale wide, sometimes confluent into a 

 band, not reaching the gastrosteges. A black collar involves the tips of the 

 occipitals, half the last superior and inferior labial, and the first three gastros- 

 teges. In front of this a baud of delicate brown includes the occipitals and 

 extends to the labials ; the latter are yellow. The inferior labials (except a 

 black spot on the second and third,) and the inframaxillaries, are also yellow. 

 The rostral, and anterior frontals are brownish yellow, (perhaps shaded with 

 red in life). The rest of the head, extending backward from the first and second 

 superior labials, to the postoculars, and anterior edge of occipitals, is black. 

 There is a spot of the same color on the line between the occipital plate3.

Colors in spirits. Body with fourteen triads of complete rings of a deep 

 chocolate brown, sometimes confluent on the belly. Spaces between these four 

 or five scales wide, of a pale yellow brown shade, each scale tipped with darker. 

 Spaces between outer and central rings of the triads covering two scales, which 

 are broadly tipped with chocolate. The color of the head is a continuation of that 

 of the anterior outer ring of the first triad. The following, however, are the mark- 

 ings of white : The occipitals (except the outer borders) and plate3 surround- 

 ing them ; the anterior borders of the inframaxillaries and inferior labials ; a 

 line bordering the fifth superior labial above, and reaching to the occiput.

We suspect that the true ground of separation of this genus from Hydrophis 

 will be found to be the separation of the frontals from the superior labials by 

 the intervention of the fronto-nasals and preocular, and not the presence of 

 rudimentary gastrosteges. The latter peculiarity is possessed in a less degree 

 by Hydrophia striata, H. nigrocincta, and others. The genus thus 

 defined would include H. p achy c e r c u s, Fischer, loc. cit, pi. 2. Should it, 

 however, be the opinion of herpetologists that the genus be referred to Hydro- 

 phis, as has been done by Dr. J. G. Fischer, the species which we possess must 

 Still continue distinct, as observed by Prof. Jan, its describer.

 ors, 103 from editors, 348 from Societies, 120 from members, correspondents, 

 the Biological Department and others, and 428 from Dr. Thomas B. Wilson; 

 ;ing in all, 1093 additions to the Library. 1032 volumes have been bound 

 during the year, 992 at the expense of Dr. Wilson and 40 by the Academy. 



The rapid increase of the Journals and Periodicals of the various scientific 

 societies, as well as of those published by individuals with whom the Academy 

 exchanges, will soon require additional room for the accommodation of this 

 very important part of the Library. This can readily be obtained by construct- 

 ing two rows of cases on the top of those in the middle of the west, or Journal 

 room of the Library, with galleries such as are on the sides of the room. By 

 removing those journals which are least frequently consulted to these upper 

 cases, room will be gained for the increase of several years. 



It is proposed during the coming year to commence, and, if possible, com- 

 plete a full catalogue of all the works now in the Library. Few students are 

 aware of the great and varied richness of the collection of books belonging to 

 the Academy, because no catalogue of it has been published since 1836, and 

 : e number of volumes has been more than tripled since that time. It is be- 

 lieved that, in some of the departments of Natural Science, almost every im- 

 portant work that has yet been published may be found. A complete and full 

 catalogue would make known to many at a distance, where the works which it 

 is important for them to consult can be found, and thus students would be 

 1 from much perplexity and loss of time, and the progress of Science 

 materially aided, while the Academy would derive great benefit from the in- 

 crease of scientific men among us.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 351 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS FOR 1859. 



The Curators take pleasure in referring to the excellent state of preserva- 

 tion of the Museum, and to its nearly complete arrangement. 



Mr. J. H. Slack, who has taken charge of and labelled the collection of mam- 

 malia, informs us that, the cabinet contains 740 mounted specimens of 379 

 species of 123 genera. The arrangement of the ornithological collection, to 

 which Dr. T. B. Wilson has devoted so much time, is rapidly approaching its 

 conclusion. The care of the herpetological cabinet, which for some tiro* had 

 lost the valuable services of Dr. Hallowell, in consequence of illness, has now 

 been undertaken by E. D. Cope, a young man who gives promise of much 

 future usefulness, both to the Academy and to Natural History. Dr. Bridges 

 continues with the arrangement of the fishes, as well as to give the aid of his 

 valuable judgment in everything appertaining to the welfare of the Academy. 

 In relation to the conchological cabinet, Mr. W. G. Binney informs us that he 

 has arranged and labelled all the American species of shells, and has prepared a 

 catalogue for publication. He adds, that our respected President, Mr Lea, has 

 kindly offered to arrange all the Naiades of the collection. Mr. L. has already 

 completed several of the groups into which he divides them, following the 

 plan of his admirable synopsis. The arrangement of the long-neglected col- 

 lection of invertebrate fossils has been undertaken by Win. M. Grabb, a young 

 and zealous naturalist, who gives many evidences of future usefulness to the 

 Natural Sciences. 



Additions to the Museum during the year about closing are as follow : 



Mammals. -Of these, there were presented 38 specimens of 32 species, 

 principally from the Smithsonian Institution, J. W. Gregory, and Geo. David- 

 son. 



Birds. Of these, Dr. T. C. Henry presented 68 skins of 50 species from 

 New Mexico. There were 19 other specimens of 14 species, together with 2 

 nests and 3 species of eggs, received from various members. 



Reptiles. Of these, there were presented 24 specimens of 16 species, prin- 

 cipally by Dr. J. E. Semple, C. Herring, and Major Le Conte. Collections

 Slack. Twelve human skulls, of various races, were presented or deposited 

 by Dr. J. Letterman, Dr. J. D. Bruns, of Charleston, C. C. Abbott, and others. 

 There were also presented 29 skeletons, skulls, and other anatomical speci- 

 mens by various members. 



Fossils. A collection of remains of the Hippopotamus, etc. of Europe was 

 presented by Isaac Lea; a collection of remains of Mosasaurus, an unknown

 and Hayden in Kansas, was presented by Drs. Wilson and Leidy, and Messrs. 

 Jeanes, Harris, Lea, and Harrison. There were also presented 37 specimens 

 of 24 species of fossil shells, etc. ; and small collectkms of the same, princi- 

 pally by Prof. Emmons, C. M. Wheatley, Dr. Moore, R. E. Rogers, T. A. Conrad, 

 J. H. Slack, and Wm. M. Gabb. 



Of fossil plants there were presented 16 specimens, among which was a

 Davidson. 



Minerals. Of these, 60 specimens of about 20 species were presented, prin- 

 cipally by W. J. Taylor, Mr. Hoopes, Mr. Rand, W. P. Foulke, and Dr. 

 Semple. A large collection of polished tablets of minerals was likewise de- 

 posited by Ed. J. Willcox ; and a collection of volcanic minerals was presented 

 by J. H. Clark. 



Botany. In this department, J. H. Lapham presented 60 species of plants 

 of Wisconsin, and Chas. R. Buckalew 43 species from the Andes. There were 

 also received 10 botanical specimens of various kinds. 



Miscellaneous. Of various objects, not coming under the head of the above 

 departments, twenty were presented, among which was a fine stereoscope 

 from J. W. Queen, and a dissecting microscope and Camera lucida from the 

 executors of the late Dr. Beck. 



There was also purchased for the use of the Academy one of Zentmayer's 

 excellent microscope stands, together with some accessory apparatus. The 

 expense was defrayed through subscription of the executors of the late Dr. 

 Mitchell, and partly from the sale of an old microscope formerly deposited by 

 Mr. Wetherill, and finally, according to the promise of the latter, becoming 

 the property of the Academy on his death. 



In conclusion, the Report is respectfully submitted by 



JOSEPH LEIDY, 

 Chairman of the Curators. 



Dr. Fisher made the following statement : 



Mr. Doubleday having given the specific name " Astarte " to a Me- 

 litsea which he has himself since transferred to the genus Argynnis, his 

 name will, of course, have the priority, and it is therefore proposed to 

 change the name of the Lepidopteron described in the Proceedings of 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences for 1858, page 179, to Argynnis Ash- 

 taroth, the ancient Phoenician name of Venus. 



The death of Augustus E. Jessup, Esq., late a member of the 

 Academy was announced ; he died at Wilmington, Del., on the 17th 

 inst., aged 63.

Reported by Dr. Walter F. Atlee, Recorder pro tem. 



Dr. Joseph Leidy, Director. 

 January and February. 



I. Anatomy. 



1. Dr. Hammond exhibited the stomach of a musk rat (Fiber zibethicus,) in order 

 to show the peculiar glandular apparatus of the organ in this animal. 



Dr. Hammond stated that having occasion recently to dissect one of these 

 animals, he had observed a fact calculated to prove of interest to this Depart- 

 ment. 



On opening the stomach, a round spongy mass about an inch in diameter was 

 found to occupy the pyloric extremity of this viscus. Upon subjecting it to 

 microscopical examination, it was ascertained to be composed of a mass of 

 tubules similar to those found in other parts of the stomach in the vertebrata 

 generally. The whole secretory apparatus was concentrated in this mass, the 

 remaining portion of the stomach being entirely devoid of any such arrange- 

 ment, consisting simply of a rugous mucous membrane, the muscular layer, 

 and the serous coat. 



A somewhat similar construction exists in the beaver, (Castor fiber,) and is 

 described by Cuvier in his Anatomie Comparte. 



Dr. Hammond had also ascertained that in the genus Arvicola (embracing the 

 common water rat,) the same formation and arrangement of the gastric tubules 

 exists. 



Dr. Hammond was not aware that attention had hitherto been directed to 

 the structure of this peculiar formation in the animals in question, and hoped to 

 be enabled to extend his researches on the subject. 



II. Physiology. 



1. Dr. Mitchell exhibited a microscopical specimen of prismatic blood crystals 

 obtained from the dried blood of the opossum, (D. Virginiana.) Dr. Mitchell 

 also exhibited blood crystals obtained from the putrescent blood of the mnsk- 

 rat, Fiber zibethicus. These crystals were rhomboidal tablets measuring a half 

 to two-thirds of a millimetre in length. They formed spontaneously in a phial 

 of blood which had stood in a warm room for five weeks, and was very putrid 

 and of a most unbearable odor.

2 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Biolog. 



In connection with the first named specimen, Dr. M. referred at some length 

 to the importance of the study of blood crystals in connection with the medico- 

 legal study of the blood, and the examination of blood stains. Dr. M. remarked 

 upon the difficulty of discriminating between the blood of man and that of 

 some other mammals, even when the blood was comparatively fresh and fluid. 

 Here, he thought, the blood crystal might serve to determine the point in 

 question. 



Usually in murder cases, only the dried blood was to be obtained, and here 

 the possibility of making use of the varied forms of blood crj r stals to determine 

 the source of the blood, was a more doubtful matter. Several questions pre- 

 sent themselves. 



Can blood crystals be obtained from the dried blood of man and animals? 

 Dr. M. has so far been unsuccessful in obtaining the characteristic form from 

 dried human blood. Some of the German observers have been more fortunate. 

 The failure to obtain the human blood crystal is not, or would not be, 

 decisive as to the inutility of this mode of research, if the blood of other 

 animals does not present a like difficulty. On this point, our information is 

 not altogether complete, because the number of animals whose blood has been 

 examined, is as yet rather limited. The blood of birds, whether in its wet 

 state, or dried, has not afforded crystals under any method as yet employed. 

 This is unfortunate as regards judicial questions, because it is often a question 

 whether a blood stain may not have been derived from pigeon or chicken 

 blood. Dr. M. referred to such a case as within his own experience. 



The blood of fishes in general affords crystals with great readiness, even after 

 the blood has been long dried. The forms are characteristic, and are not 

 likely to be confounded with those of human blood. 



The blood of all reptiles is difficult to crystallize. Dr. M. would say, after 

 many trials, impossible, were it not for the results which others have observed. 

 At all events no observer has obtained crystals by treating the dried blood of 

 reptiles, nor is it likely that the blood of this class will ever- play any part in a 

 judicial investigation. In regard to birds, fishes and reptiles, it is to be observed 

 that the form of the blood globule, and its nuclear condition, may be decisive 

 as to its not being human, and that the production of blood crystals from the 

 blood of these classes is not, therefore, so important as in the case of mammalia, 

 and especially of the domestic animals. In some of these, as the cat, the blood 

 affords good crystals when properly treated, either in afresh state, or still better 

 when decomposing. Dr. Mitchell was unable to obtain crystals by treating the 

 dried blood of the bullock or sheep, but he obtained crystals easily from the 

 dried blood of the opossum, and from several of the rodentia. It is probable 

 that we shall be able at some future time to obtain crystals from the dried 

 blood of any animal. 



Dr. M. especially insisted on the greater ease with which putrescent blood 

 yielded crystals. He thought that exposure to light and the decomposition of 

 the blood, previous to its being dried, were the most favorable conditions. The 

 disappearance of the fibrinous mass under these circumstances, placed the 

 process of crystallization in the best circumstances by setting free the mass of 

 blood globules. Dr. Mitchell was accustomed to obtain crystals from dried 

 blood by moistening the dried clot and occasionally supplying water until 

 pii' refaction began, when the blood was treated as though it was fresh. 



The blood thus moistened was examined for crystals by the usual method 

 from day to day, but the best results were commonly observed at the period of 

 decomposition. 



Dr. Mitchell's remarks gave rise to an animated discussion of the medico- 

 legal examination of blood stains. 



Dr. Woodward was of opinion, that it generally is impossible to state the 

 particular mammal from 'which the blood of a dried blood stain has come, by 

 any mode of microscopic inspection. Dr. Schmidt had constructed tables of 



[Feb. 




Dept.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3 



the relative size of the " dried blood globule in man and many animals." Dr. 

 Woodward thongbt too much stress had been laid upon these measurements, 

 and conceived, that a question which it was very difficult to answer in regard 

 to fresh blood, must become almost unanswerable with dried blood. He had 

 himself been examined in a case where those concerned evidently expected that 

 the microscope would enable him to say of the specimen of dried blood, this is 

 the blood of man, or of this or that mammal. He had found himself unable to 

 decide, and had stated as his fixed opinion, that no examination by the micros- 

 cope of the blood globules fresh or dried and remoistened would enable any 

 one to swear as to the source of the specimen. He mentioned this, because in 

 this city and elsewhere other opinions are held and taught by many medical 

 men. 



Dr. Leidy stated his opinion to be the same as that held by Dr. Woodward. 

 He would feel it to be very unsafe to declare positively to what particular 

 animal certain blood corpuscles belonged. He alluded also to cases where, 

 when judicially examined, he had been obliged to correct erroneous opinions 

 similar to those spoken of by Dr. Woodward. 



Dr. Hammond agreed entirely with the opinions held by these gentlemen. 



Dr. Hartshorne stated that he had come to the same conclusion as to the im- 

 possibility of deciding positively as to the source of blood stains, with or with- 

 out the use of the microscope. 



Dr. Hammond declared that in only one class of cases did he believe that the 

 microscope could be of any service ; it would enable the physician to pro- 

 nounce with confidence that certain stains did not come from the blood of a 

 human being when the corpuscles contained therein were oval or nucleated. 



Dr. Atlee stated that he had never observed any white corpuscles in speci- 

 mens of dried blood. Drs. Leidy and Hammond added the remark, that, as far 

 as their recollection served, they had not observed them. 



Dr. Woodward declared that he had seen them very distinctly after six 

 months had elapsed, when blood had been dried rapidly on a slide. 



This difference of opinion was attributed by Dr. Morris to not using oblique 

 lights, by which these bodies are much more readily distinguished. 



2. Dr. Hammond read a paper entitled " Observations on the Colorless Blood-cor- 

 puscles," which was referred to a committee.* From a series of experiments Dr. 

 Hammond was led to infer that the white corpuscle is not so persistent in dried 

 blood as the red disc, and therefore not so capable of affording reasonable indi- 

 cations as to the presence of blood as the latter. 



III. Pathology and Pathological Anatomy. 



1. Dr. Leidy exhibited specimens of a Trichina found in the muscles 

 of a human subject. He stated that he often meets with this parasite, and, 

 most frequently, in the biceps muscle of the fore-arm. 



2. Dr. Mitchell described a gall-stone found in the gall bladder of a musk-rat. 

 It was a soft, amber-colored mass, dissolving readily in hot alcohol. As to the 

 exact nature of this substance he was not determined ; it was not, however, 

 either bile, pigment, or cholesterine. 



Dr. Uhler, as the result of very considerable study of organic substances, 

 stated he was inclined to believe that many bodies, described as such, are never 

 found in the organism during life, but are the product of chemical manipula- 

 tions. Moreover, he wished to lay stress upon the point that when vitality

leaves any substance, as, for instance, albumen, it loses something it had 

 before, and is no longer the same. In his opinion, bile in the gall bladder is 

 not bile in the chemist's capsule. 



3. Dr. Mitchell stated that in a case which had recently occurred to him after, 

 the death of the mother from phthisis, the abdomen was opened three quarters 

 of an hour after her death, and the child, a well developed infant, was found 

 dead and perfectly rigid. He believed the child to have died some time 

 before the mother, from the fact that rigor mortis does not occur so soon as the 

 time mentioned in well nourished bodies. 



In connection with this subject, Dr. Darrach recalled the ease with which, in 

 some persons, the cutis could be made to rise into weals like those of urticaria. 



Considerable discussion ensued as to the interpretation of the phenomena 

 above mentioned, and as to the amount and situation of the non-striated mus- 

 cular fibre in the skin. 



4. Dr. Hammond exhibited the liver of a rabbit (Lepus domesticus) containing 

 an immense number of eggs of a parasite. The liver was enormously enlarged, 

 and to the naked eye its whole tissue appeared to be supplanted by granular 

 masses contained in cysts ; these bodies when examined by the microscope 

 were seen to be composed of numberless oval cells, containing a distinct nucleus 

 the yolk. Attached to the liver and hanging in the peritoneal cavity were 

 several masses of hydatids, no taeniae or other parasites were found in the 

 stomach or intestines. Eggs of the same character as those above referred to 

 were found by Dr. H. in the spleen. 



Dr. Hammond also alluded to the constant occurrence of entozoa eggs in the 

 spleen of Chelonian reptiles. In a considerable number of specimens of Emys 

 guttata, Emys terrapin, Emys insculpta, and Emys picta which he had dissect- 

 ed, he had never found these bodies absent from the spleen. Drawings of these 

 eggs, as also of those found in the rabbit, were exhibited. 



Dr. Hammond also referred to the common opinion that the lower animals 

 were but little subject to disease. This idea he regarded as erroneous, and 

 tnought that the numerous examinations now made of all classes of animals, 

 would soon demonstrate that man is proportionately much less liable to dis- 

 ease than is generally supposed. 



5. Dr. Leidy exhibited a specimen of human muscle containing numbers of 

 the peculiar cysts described by him in a former number of the American Jour- 

 nal of the Medical Sciences. These cysts appear not to contain entozoa or 

 their eggs. He had also frequently observed them in the skin. They were 

 irregularly stelliform, and consisted of a fibrous investment enclosing numer- 

 ous extremely small granules. 



Dr. Woodward stated that he had been requested to examine these bodies, 

 and that upon so doing microscopially he was able to confirm Dr. Leidy's opin- 

 ion of their structure. The minute granules were insoluble in ether, and there- 

 fore if consisting of fat were probably enveloped in an albuminous coat. 



March. 

 I. Anatomy. 



1. Dr. Packard called attention to the structure of the swimming bladder of 

 the Gar Pike (Lcpidostexis) recently caught in the Delaware, and exhibited a 

 portion of the wall. The inner surface of the air bladder of the gar fish re- 

 cently dissected, presented an arrangement closely resembling that of the 

 heart ; viz : papilliform muscles, or columnee carnce, arising from the wall, and 

 fastened by fine tendinous cords to the edges of tendinous valves, likewise 

 connected with the wall of the bladder. 



Between these structures the surface of the wall displayed ridges of mus- 



[March, 




Dept.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 5 



cle running in various directions, the result of their actions being to diminish 

 in all directions the calibre of the organ. The muscles first alluded to had 

 their attached ends towards the caudal extremity of the fish, and ran nearly- 

 parallel with the axis of the body : their length, not including the tendons, 

 was about ^ inch, or less. 



Under the microscope, fully-formed striated muscular fibre was observed in 

 these structures. The fibres measured about l-1350th of an inch in diameter, 

 and the ultimate fibrillar were very coarse. In the heart, the muscular fibres 

 measured about l-1200th of an inch, but their ultimate fibrillar were much 

 more delicate. 



Dr. Packard was at some loss to recognize the use of this peculiar structural 

 arrangement. Dr. Hammond had examined many fishes, but had never met 

 with striated muscular fibre in this organ. Dr. Mitchell thought that the great 

 rigidity of the scaly covering on this fish might render necessary some addi- 

 tional means of contracting the air sac. He thought the question as to how it 

 was filled a more difficult one. The gar can have no suctorial power, and the 

 air sac is surmounted by a glottis admirably calculated to exclude the air. 

 Dr. Hammond called attention to the degenerated state of the muscular tis 

 sues of this specimen. They were more or less converted into fatty matter, 

 and this was especially the case in the muscles of the belly. 



Dr. Mitchell described the peculiarities of the circulatory apparatus of 

 the gar pike. In this fish a hepatic vein and a vein from the muscles 

 of the left side open at the same point into the auricle ; a third vein from the 

 muscles of the right side opens into the auricle by a separate orifice. The mouths 

 of all these veins are provided with more or less perfect valves, whose edges 

 are attached to the walls of the auricle by tendinous cords and muscular 

 columns. The auricle is very large and easily dilated. The auriculo-ventri- 

 cular opening has a short fringe-like valve which extends around two thirds of 

 the aperture. The ventricle is small, and very thick. In the specimen exam- 

 ined, no distinct valves could be seen at the orifice through which the ventricle 

 delivers its blood into the bulbus arteriosus, nor were there any valves such as 

 are usually found in the arterial bulb itself. The interior of this organ was 

 furnished with six rows of projecting wart-like prominences, each of which 

 was connected with the one above and the one below, in the same row, by deli- 

 cate and nunieroiis tendinous filaments whose office it was difficult to compre- 

 hend. 



II. Physiology. 



1. Dr. Mitchell drew the attention of the Department to a peculiar contraction 

 which is produced when a blow is struck over any of the muscles which are not 

 very firmly bound down by fascia. 



Dr. Stokes of Dublin, long ago observed that when he percussed the skin 

 over the pectoralis muscle, its fibres contracted responsive to the stimulus 

 of the blow. While percussing certain consumptive patients, Dr. Mitchell noticed 

 that as the bar of muscle ceased to contract, a second contraction took place 

 nearly at right angles to the first one. By it the skin was raised into a promi- 

 nence, some lines in breadth and rather longer than the space covered by the 

 percussing finger end. This secondary contraction so slowly disappeared that 

 it seemed to be due rather to the action of organic non-striated muscle, than 

 to the striated variety of which voluntary muscles are composed, and which is 

 habitually rapid in its mode of contraction and of relaxation. Further observa- 

 tion showed Dr. Mitchell that a large part of the muscles, which are neither 

 deeply, placed or firmly bound down by fascia, are able to exhibit both ot the 

 forms of contraction here alluded to. Thus the extensor muscles of the leg and arm 

 are not very susceptible to this form of direct stimulus, while the flexors and most 

 of the muscles of the trunk, both before and behind, can be made to exhibit 

 both forms of contraction by tapping them smartly and quickly with the finger

6 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Bioloc 



point of a percussion hammer. The primary contraction, or that which involves 

 the whole length of a fasciculus of muscle, is best seen when we strike upon 

 the region of the pectoralis major or that of the gluteus maximus. The second- 

 ary and local contraction is best developed by percussing the pectoral region 

 and the skin which covers the infra spiaatus scapular muscle. Illustrations 

 of the phenomena in question are so frequently within reach of the members 

 that Dr. M. did not consider it necessary to describe them more fully. 



Several circumstances had already convinced Dr. Mitchell that the secondary 

 contraction, described by him, was not due to the action of the non-striated 

 muscle of the skin. A very obvious and simple experimental test at once 

 referred the phenomenon in question to its proper source, the voluntary 

 muscles beneath the cuticle. 



A small rabbit was rendered insensible by the aid of chloroform, and the 

 skin was removed from the chest so as to expose the surface of the pect. 

 major muscle. Upon striking the muscle with a scalpel handle or any blunt 

 body, two distinct reactions ensued. 1st. The fasciculus of muscle which was 

 stretched by the blow, instantly and rapidly contracted and relaxed. As the 

 relaxation took place, a local contraction occurred at the point struck, so that 

 a small portion of the muscle could be seen to gather itself into a little' mound, 

 which again disappeared within from twenty seconds to half a minute. Both 

 phenomena, then, are due to the contractibility of voluntary muscular fibre. 

 Dr. Hammond, who had witnessed the experiment, and who had also seen the 

 phenomenon in question, agreed with the explanation given by Dr. M. 



2. Dr. Hammond stated that having had occasion recently to vivisect a bat, 

 (V. novaboracensis) he had observed that the heart continued to beat for some 

 minutes after the chest was laid open. Upon seizing the organ with a pair of 

 forceps a short distance above the orifice of the larger vessels, and severing the 

 connection of the heart by dividing these above the place where they were 

 compressed, pulsation still continued both in the auricles and ventricles for a 

 minute and a half. At the end of that period the heart ceased to act, and 

 could not be re-excited by pricking it with the point of a needle. On opening 

 the forceps so as to allow a little blood to escape, pulsation recommenced and 

 continued for about a minute. It then ceased and could not be excited by 

 irritation. A little more blood was then suffered to escape, and pulsation 

 immediately followed, continuing for several seoonds. The same thing was 

 repeated two or three times with a like result, until all the blood had flowed 

 out. The heart then remained perfectly quiescent ; its irritability was entirely 

 gone. Dr. Hammond regarded this experiment as tending to disprove the 

 hypothesis that the blood is the excitor of contractility in the heart. 



III. Pathology. 



1. Dr. Atlee exhibited a vesicle from an Hydatid Mole, mounted in a slide for 

 convenience of examination under the microscope. The specimen came from 

 a patient who was enormously swollen, with albuminuria to a very high degree, 

 and vomitings smelling most offensively of urine. Although but four orfive 

 months gone in her pregnancy, the uterus was above the umbilicus. The 

 mass which was spontaneously discharged from the uterus was about as large 

 as the head, and almost entirely similar to the specimen presented. A small 

 part, perhaps as large as two or three fingers, presented the usual color and 

 consistence of the placenta, while all the rest was colorless and of the consistence 

 of ordinary gelatine. All this latter portion was divided into grape-like masses 

 of vesicles full of liquid, varying in size from a pin's head to that of an or- 

 dinary marble. There was no vestige of an embryo. 



These moles are caused by what might be styled dropsy of the" villosities of 

 the chorion. The villosities of the chorion are hollow and composed of a large 

 pedicle, from which a trunk proceeds that is subdivided into many branches. 

 Each one of these ramifications terminates in a cul-de-sac. These moles are 



[March, 




H 



Dept.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7 



formed by dilatations of the ramifications filled with fluid, taken, of course, by- 

 imbibition from the uterine caduca. This condition of things is recognizable 

 not only from the exterior aspect of the mass, but on examining one of these 

 grape-like bodies under a microscope, the same peculiar amorphous substance, 

 with nuclei and granulations interposed, is seen, that characterises the vil- 

 losities of the chorion. 



It is worthy of mention that this is the second time this woman had this 

 tame false conception, as it is termed. 



Dr. Woodward read a paper entitled " On Suppuration in Cancerous GVoiwfAs." 

 After stating that many of the purulent looking fluids found in connection 

 with cancers were not pus, but softened cancer matter, this paper proceeded 

 to detail a minute anatomy of a case of ulcerated cancer of the breast, in which 

 a true pus was discharged from the ulcers. 



Attention was called to the absence, in this and in many other cases, of the 

 train of peculiar symptoms designated as the cancerous cachexia, and the 

 probability was hinted that these phenomena (as distinct from mere exhaustion 

 by suppuration or hemorrhage,) might, perhaps, bear less relation to cancer 

 per se, than to cancerous infiltration of certain internal organs. 



In connection with the minute anatomy of the tumor, various doctrinal 

 points were discussed. Especially were the phenomena of suppuration in 

 cancer, as here noted, regarded as confirming the doctrine of the homology of 

 cancer with new formations of connective tissue, and as antagonistic to a 

 purely humeral view of the pathology of cancers. 



The paper will be published in full in the American Journal of Medical Sciences. 



April. 

 I. Pathology. 



1. Dr. Morris presented to the Department, a human embryo, accompanied 

 with its membranes. The membranes were developed as much as they gene- 

 rally are at two and a half months. The embryo itself appeared to have been 

 arrested in its development at one and a half mouths. The chorion and amnion 

 were separated by effused blood, which was also found beneath the coverings 

 of the foetus and immediately around it. 



2. Dr. Leidy called the attention of members of the Department to specimens 

 on the table of three kinds of dipterous larva? from man. As he had not made the 

 tiies an especial subject of investigation, he could not say postively to what 

 genera and species the larvae belonged. 



No. 1, of which there are seven specimens in the vial, appear to be the larvae 

 of the Blue-bottle fly. They are part of a number which were given him by 

 a physician, and had been vomited from the stomach by a child. 



These larvae are half an inch in length, and 1 lines at the broadest part; 

 elongated conical, anteriorly acute, posteriorly obtuse ; everywhere minutely 

 shagreened ; anterior articuli strongly marked ; posterior ones with a transverse 

 row of minute papillae becoming obsolete anteriorly. Head bipapillate, with 

 a pair of hooks projecting from the mouth. Succeeding articuhis with a spira- 

 cle on each side. Caudal articulus with an elliptical pit margined with a 

 corona of conical tubercles, and having at bottom a pair of large spiracles. 

 Anal aperture bounded on each side with a large trilateral wart, and posteriorly 

 with a transverse crest terminating at each end in a conical tubercle. 



No. 2, of which there are five specimens in the vial, appear to be the larvae of a 

 species of Anthomyia or Flower-fly. These are part of numerous specimens, which 

 were given to him for examination, by a physician who had obtained it from his 

 own person. He had been seized with all the symptoms of cholera morbus, 

 and in the discharges he had detected numerous specimens of this, to him, 

 unknown parasite. It was in the latter part of summer ; and the larvae, it If 

 suspected, had been swallowed with some cold boiled vegetables. 



1859.] 




8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Biolog. 



The larvse are from three to three and a half lines long, and from one to one 

 and a quarter lines broad ; demi-elliptical ; articnli strongly marked, every- 

 where minutely shagreened ; body anteriorly subacute, posteriorly obtuse. 

 Head bipapillate, with a pair of hooks projecting from the mouth. Articuli 

 furnished dorsally and laterally, each with six long, posteriorly divergent, 

 flexible, compound spines ; ventral segments transversely subdivided, the 

 posterior subdivision furnished with a transverse row of papilla?. Caudal arti- 

 culus dorsally sloping, furnished with a pair of prominent spiracular tubercles, 

 and fringed with six spines. Anus ventral. 



The same larva Dr. L. had observed in another case, accompanied with the 

 ordinary phenomena of cholera morbus. 



No. 3, of which there are nine specimens in the vial, are of especial interest, 

 as being the larva? of a Bot-fly obtained from man. These specimens were 

 procured by our friend, the accurate naturalist, Dr. Le Conte, during the sum- 

 mer of 1857, in Honduras, Central America. They are part of a larger number 

 of specimens obtained by Dr. L. from his travelling companions. Dr Le Conte 

 had not observed the perfect insect, nor was it known when the latter deposited 

 its eggs. The larvje were usually found beneath the skin of the shoulders, 

 breast, arms, buttocks, and thighs, and were suspected to have been intro- 

 duced when the persons were bathing. Thomas Say was the first to describe 

 the larva of a bot-fly from man ; the specimen having been taken by Dr. Brick, 

 from his own leg, while in South America. 



Recently, Keferstein (Verb. d. Zool. Bot. Vereins, vi, 1856, 637) has pre- 

 pared an elaborate essay in which he discusses the question as to the existence 

 of a true Oestrus hominis. The result of the discussion appears to be that the 

 latter does not exist, but that the oestrus larva obtained from man is that of 

 the Cuterebra noxialis, which is especially obnoxious to domestic cattle. 



The specimens of larva? of Dr. Le Conte, however, appear to differ from those 

 generally referred to by Keferstein, but agree with that described by Say, and 

 are not like those described and figured by Goudot, in the An. d. Sc. Nat., 

 1845, Zool. iii., 221. 



According to F. Midler, quoted by Keferstein, the deposit of the egg of the 

 bot-fly in man is very painful. Dr. Le Conte informs us that his companions 

 were not aware of the time when the eggs of the larvse obtained by him were 

 deposited in their body. He also states the presence of the larva gave rise to 

 comparatively little uneasiness. 



These larva? are from two and a half to five lines long : clavate, incurved ; 

 anteriorly ovate, from three-fifths to one and a half lines wide ; posteriorly 

 cylindro-conical, from one-fifth to half a line wide. Head bipapillate, with a 

 pair of hooks projecting from the mouth. Succeeding three articuli covered 

 with minute, black, uncinate spines ; the next three articuli each provided 

 with large, black, conical, uncinate spines, with a broad striated base and the 

 sharp apex directed backward, arranged in a double row dorsally and forming 

 a single row ventrally. Remainder of the body abruptly narrowed, indistinctly 

 articulated, and smooth, except the last pair of articuli, which are separated by 

 a constriction, and are covered with minute recurved black hooks. The last 

 articulus is oblate spheroidal, enclosing a pair of spiracles and the anal aper- 

 ture bounded by a pair of papilla?. 



Dr. Leidy further called the attention of the Department to a drawing of pus- 

 like corpuscles, which he had obtained from an abscess in the adductor muscle 

 of an oyster. The corpuscles were spherical, granular, and nearly uniform in 

 size. Acetic acid rendered them paler ; did not evolve a compound nucleus,

1. Dr. I. I. Hayes read a paper entitled On the Relations existing between 

 Fova and the capacity of Man to resist low Temperatures. 



This paper was recommended for publication in a Medical Journal. The 

 following is an abstract of the contents :

II. Hygiene. 



Dr. Hayes stated that during the late cruise of the Advance to the Arctic 

 seas, his attention was directed to some facts in relation to the capabilities of 

 men to resist low temperatures, which, at the friendly suggestion of Dr. Ham- 

 mond, he had grouped together, and, with permission, would submit them to 

 the Department. 



He thought that' there was a great misapprehension existing in the popular 

 mind upon the subject of Arctic life, it being generally thought that Arctic 

 travellers were necessarily subjected to great hardships, in consequence of the 

 lowness of the atmospheric temperatures. This he could but consider a great 

 mistake. The animal economy everywhere adapts itself with greater or less 

 facility to surrounding circumstances, and this power of adaptation is no where 

 more strikingly exhibited than in the Arctic regions. The appetite and diges- 

 tive powers are doubtless more intimately concerned than any other of the 

 animal functions, and, in the quantity and quality of the food consumed we 

 are led to look for an explanation of the cause which enables the inhabitants 

 of Polar countries so successfully to resist the cold. 



The Esquimaux, with whom he had had communication in the far North, 

 were found living mainly without fire. They have no wood, and no means of 

 creating an artificial temperature, except with a small lamp, using blubber for 

 fuel and moss for wick. The flame of this lamp gives very little heat, and is 

 barely sufficient to melt from the snow the water which they require, and to 

 light their huts during the dark period of the winter. During the coldest 

 season they often live in snow-houses, the temperature of which ranges from 

 zero to the freezing point, being kept thus elevated above the temperature 

 outside, which rangesjfrom 30 to 70, idiiefly by the heat radiated from the 

 persons of the occupants; yet, with this seemingly unendurable tempera- 

 ture they appear to live in comfort. They do not hesitate to expose themselves 

 to any degree of cold, when engaged in hunting, and often sleep upon the snow, 

 with no other protection than a piece of bear skin, on which they lie. Never- 

 theless, these people are strong, robust and healthy. Scurvy is unknown 

 amongst them, and Dr. Hayes had never heard of, or seen, a case of tubercu- 

 lar disease. 



Dr. Hayes thought that we must look for an explanation of this wonderful 

 power of resistance to the character of their food. They subsist entirely 

 upon an animal diet, the flesh mainly of the walrus, seal, narwhal and 

 bear ; and the quantity which they consume seems really enormous. He had 

 frequently seen an Esquimaux hunter, when preparing for a long chase, eat 

 from six to twelve pounds, at least one-third of which was fat, and he would 

 place the daily consumption of the men at from twelve to fifteen pounds. In 

 this large consumption of animal food they find their shield against the cold, 

 and he does not believe that they could live upon a vegetable diet under such 

 exposure. The same laws govern the Esquimaux and the white men, and 

 just in proportion as the crew of the Advance accustomed themselves to the 

 diet of the natives, did they gain power to expose themselves with impunity 

 to low temperatures. They found themselves continually craving animal 

 food, and especially fatty substances. The process of acclimation went on in 

 proportion to their ability to eat and digest this kind of diet. During the early 

 part of the cruise, they suffered much from temperatures, which, at a later 

 period, produced no impression whatever upon them. 



Dr. Hayes thought it was worthy of more than a mere passing remark, that 

 scurvy and strumous diseases were unknown to the natives of the region, so 

 far, at least, as his observations extended. In relation to the last, he would 

 merely submit the fact : with regard to the former, he would say that where- 

 ever scurvy has occurred in the Arctic regions, it has been owing to accidental 

 causes, which experience has taught us to remove or avoid. The' long con- 

 tinned use of a salt meat diet had much to do with its development, and, as

accessories, the cold, darkness, and excessive exertions. There is now, how- 

 ever, no necessity for the use of such a diet, and with abundant supplies of fish, 

 animal food, and especially of fat, the last mentioned predisposing causes of 

 disease ceased to have existence. Dr. Hayes thought that it was owing to their 

 weakened condition, resulting from the use of salt food, of which they could 

 eat only small quantities, allowing the cold and darkness to prey upon them, 

 that an epilepto-tetanoidal disease exhibited itself amongst the men of Dr. Kane's 

 command, and affected similarly their dogs. 



While fresh animal food is absolutely essential to the inhabitants of Arctic 

 countries, Dr. Hayes considered alcohol in any shape not only useless but 

 positively injurious ; and in this opinion he was fully sustained by the expe- 

 rience of the enterprising and indefatigable traveller, Dr. Rae, whom we had 

 recently the highly gratifying opportunity of welcoming to the Academy. On 

 the other hand, tea and coffee are most useful ; and he found himself at a loss 

 to say which is best. The English and Russian's prefer tea, while Dr. Kane's 

 men took most kindly to tea in the evening when retiring, and coffee in the 

 morning when preparing for a day's journey. 



In relation to the animal diet used by the Esquimatix, Dr. Hayes observed 

 that they eat it chiefly uncooked and frozen. This fact had been useful to 

 Mm, and he would suggest it to his brethren of the profession as having, per- 

 haps, some importance. He had frequently found that stomachs of scorbutic 

 patients, which rejected cooked meats, would readily take raw meat in this 

 state, or, as they expressed it, " cooked with frost." By this process the re- 

 pulsiveness of the uncooked flesh is entirely destroyed. 



Dr. Hayes said, in conclusion, lhat he submitted these facts to the Depart- 

 ment without comment, leaving for those better qualified to determine as to 

 whether they threw any new light upon the highly interesting and important 

 physiological questions which they involve.

 I. Pathology. 



Dr. Packard read a paper " On the Pathological Relations of Cancer cend Tu- 

 bercle,*" of which the following is an abstract: 



There are several ways of accounting for the property called malignancy, so 

 commonly attributed to these formations. 



1. A new element may be supposed as formed in or entering the blood, and 

 to be eliminated as if by a gland. 



2. The new growth may be considered as the starting point, infecting the 

 system by a sort of radiation. 



3. It may be assigned to a mere deterioration of the nutritive material. 



4. Some abnormal element may be imagined, determining an erratic devel- 

 opment of tissues not themselves essentially abnormal. 



The subject is capable of some elucidation from clinical history as well as 

 from morbid anatomy. 



I. Under the head of etiology must be considered 



(1). Predisposing causes: (a), Inheritance; (6), Age; (c), Sex; (d), Com- 

 plexion; (e), Residence in the city or country; (/), Occupation; (g), De- 

 pressing influences. 



(2). Exciting causes : (a), Mental or other depression; (6), External vio- 

 lence; (c), Contagion. 



(II). Under the head of symptomatology, all the phenomena occurring in 

 the course of these diseases must be considered. 



(a), Seat of disease ; (6), Mode of attack ; (c), Duration ; (d), Amount and

kind of pain; (e), Mental state; (/), Hectic fever; (g), Formation of hu_ 

 mors; (A), Modes of termination ; (i), Convertibility ; (/), Coexistence. 



The relations of cancer and tubercle to other growths may be readily summed 

 up. 



(III). Under the head of morbid anatomy may be mentioned (a), The the- 

 ory of special anatomical elements, characteristic of cancer and tubercle. 



(6), The theory that those elements are analogous to, or identical with certain 

 normal elements of the body. 



This latter theory is, perhaps, the most convenient, but there are some very 

 strong arguments against it, mainly derived from the preceding considerations. 



The object of this discussion has been to show that at the present time the 

 material at command is not sufficient for the establishment of any general law, 

 but that we must endeavor to accumulate evidence both from clinical obser- 

 vation and from minute anatomy, until some definite conclusion presents itself. 



II. Physiology. 



Drs. Hammond and Mitchell read a paper entitled ''Experimental Researches 

 relating to Corroval and Vao, two new varieties of Woorara, the South American 

 arrow poison.*'''' 



After detailing the history, mode of preparation, physiology and chemistry 

 of the woorara, the authors state their own experiments with the two new va- 

 rieties of this poison, obtained by Drs. Ruscheuberger and Caldwell of the 

 United States Navy, from the Rio Darien, Soutli America, and given to them 

 by Prof. Carson of the University of Pennsylvania. 



From these substances they obtained an alkaloid possessing when adminis- 

 tered in exceedingly small doses, all the power of the corroval or vao. The 

 corroval yielded a much larger per centage of this principle than the vao, which 

 accounts for the greater activity of the former. This alkaloid is uncrystalliza- 

 ble, but forms salts with many of the acids. AVhen pure it is of a very light 

 green hue, somewhat resembling tannin in appearance. It is intensely bitter. 



For this alkaloid they propose the name of corrovalia. 

 _ Numerous experiments were made with the corroval and vao, from which 

 the authors deduce the following conclusions : 



Corroval. 1st. That it differs essentially from any variety of woorara hitherto 

 described, both in its chemical constitution and physiological effects. 



2d. That it acts primarily upon the heart, through the medium of the blood, 

 producing an arrest of the action of this organ. 



3d. That it produces a cessation of the movements of the lymph hearts in 

 from twenty to thirty minutes after its introduction into the circulation. 



4th. That the annihilation of voluntary and reflex movements is a secondary 

 result of its action, depending primarily upon the discontinuance of the func- 

 tions of the heart. 



5th. That it acts upon the nerves from the periphery to the centre, .and 

 abolishes both the sensory and motor functions. 



6th. That it destroys muscular irritability. 



7th. That it paralyzes the sympathetic nerve, this being one of the primary 

 effects. 



8th. That it is absorbed both from the intestinal canal and skin of frogs . 



9th. That its poisonous qualities are due to an alkaloid hitherto undescribed. 

 Vao. 1. Vao, either in a solid, or more quickly in a liquid form, can be ab- 

 sorbed from the areolar tissues of cold-blooded animals, as the frog. 



2. It is also absorbed, if in solution, by the stomach, oesophageal mucous 

 membrane, rectum, and skin, .with a degree of rapidity which varies, and is 

 rapid or slow as the animal is well supplied with water. 



3. Warm-blooded animals absorb vao from the stomach and intestine when 



*See American Journal of Medical Science, for Ju!y, 1859, for this paper in full, 



1859,] 




12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Biolog. 



they are fasting, but suffer no ill effects when the vao is given during digestion. 

 That this protection is not due to a mere mixture of the vao with the food of 

 the full stomach, is shown by the fact that rabbits, whose stomachs are always 

 more or less distended with food, are protected only when owing to the entry 

 of fresh food, digestion becomes active. 



4. The demands of the system for water do not affect to any perceptible ex- 

 tent the absorption of vao from the stomach of the rabbit. 



5. The circulation of the frog is arrested within from ten minutes to one 

 hour by the introduction of vao under the skin. The same result obtains 

 within from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, when the poison is .swallowed in 

 small doses. 



6. The first effect of vao is to increase the force of the heart without increas- 

 ing the number of its pulsations. 



7. The next effect is a paralysis of the musciilar tissues of the heart, so that 

 the ventricle stops first, and the right and left auricles next, in the order in 

 which they are named. In a majority of the frogs poisoned by vao, the heart 

 remains galvanically irritable for a certain time after the organ has ceased to 

 pulsate. 



8. The heart stops before the voluntary motions are at an end, in all-cases 

 of rapid poisoning. When poisoning occurs by absorption from a mucous sur- 

 face, the phenomena march more slowly, and voluntary control and reflex 

 power are both lost before the heart has entirely ceased to beat. 



9. Vao stops the respiration in warm-blooded animals by arresting the cir- 

 culation, and so paralyzing the nervous system, without which respiration is 

 impossible, so that the checked respiration is a consequence and not a cause 

 of the injury to the cardiac functions. 



10. In'the batrachia also, the respiratory movements cease before the heart 

 has entirely lost the power to pulsate. 



11. In the alligator poisoned by vao the respiration is perfect some time after 

 the heart is at rest. 



12. The facts last quoted and the inability of artificial respiration to restore 

 or sustain the cardiac movements in warm-blooded animals poisoned by vao, 

 prove sufficiently that the first effect of the poison is upon the heart, and that 

 the appearances of asphyxia observed post-mortem in rabbits, cats, etc., are of 

 secondary importance so far as concerns the cause of death. 



13. The temperature of warm-blooded animals poisoned by vao falls with 

 considerable rapidity, and does not undergo any elevation after death. 



14. The nerves of sensation first lose their power to convey impressions the 

 motor nerves are next affected. The paralysis of the nerves extends from the 

 periphery to the centre. The affection of the nervous system may be due to 

 the sudden arrest of the circulation, and not of necessity to the direct in- 

 fluence of the vao. The irritability of the voluntary muscles in the frog is 

 lost much-earlier than is the case when the animal dies by decapitation. 



15. The sympathetic nerve is paralysed, at least in the upper portion of its 

 distribution, before the nerves elsewhere have lost their functional power. 



16. The ciliary motion is unaffected by the use of vao. 



17. The blood of animals thus poisoned coagulated as usual, and had not 

 lost the power of changing color when exposed to oxygen or carbonic acid. 



18. So far as we are aware, no true physiological antidote exists for vao 

 poison, since even artificial respiration fails to sustain life in animals affected 

 by it. 



19. The vao poison olosely resembles corroval in its physical, chemical, and 

 physiological reactions. The alkaloids extracted from the two poisons produce 

 in. animals of equal size effects which cannot be distinguished. 



20. We, therefore, are inclined to consider vao as merely a weaker variety of 

 corroval, and to conclude that the apparent difference in the effects produced 

 by the original extracts is due to a difference in their strength.

I. Physiology. 



A paper was read entitled ' ' An Experimental Examination of the Physiologi- 

 cal effects of Sassy-Bark, the ordeal poison of the Western Coast of Africa ; by 

 S. Weir Mitchellj M. D., Lecturer on Physiology in the Philadelphia Medical 

 Association, and William A. Hammond, M. D., assistant Surgeon U. S. A.* 

 The following is an abstract of this paper : 



Sassy-Bark is derived from a tree described by Prof. Procter as Erythraph- 

 leum Judiciale, and in the Gardener's Dictionary of Mr. George Dow, as E. 

 Guineense. 



The bark occurs in pieces four inches and upwards in length, and half an 

 inch in thickness. It is of a deep red color, a slight odor and a marked as- 

 tringent, taste due to tannic acid. Both alcohol and water extract its active 

 principles. Mr. Procter failed to obtain from it any crystallizable alkaloid. 

 The preparations used by us were the dry alcoholic extract the alcoholic 

 tincture. 



The effects of sassy, when used as an ordeal poison, have been described by 

 Wilson, Winterbottom, Beecham and Christison, and are fully detailed in the 

 paper of which this is an abstract. 



The bark is given in aqueous infusion to the suspected person, who is re- 

 quired to drink large quantities, (several pints). If it produces emesis 

 the person is esteemed innocent ; but if he becomes giddy or confused, he is 

 considered guilty and is put to death. 



The sassy employed by us was first given to animals, and was finally 

 taken in considerable amount by the authors of this paper. 



As is usual in such examinations, frogs were first employed to test the pecu- 

 liar characters of the poison. 



Experiment. A large frog received under the skin of his back one drachm 

 of the tincture, previously warmed to drive off the alcohol. At the close of two 

 hours he had become very sluggish, and indisposed to move. He continued i:i 

 this condition during twenty-four hours, and then gradually recovered. 



Experiment. A frog received a similar dose in the same manner. His heart 

 wa3 then exposed, and attentively watched. It became more feeble as the frog 

 became sluggish, but no alteration in the number of its pulsations was observed. 

 In the course of two or three hours the frog became extremely torpid, hut was 

 still able to move when roughly irritated. A. second frog, which received 15 

 of the evaporated tincture in his back, and three grains of the extract in hi* 

 stomach, became inert like the others, but at the close of forty-eight hours was 

 again active, and on being replaced in water was well two days later. 



Still larger doses were tried upon other frogs, with so little result of interest, 

 that we turned at length to warm-blooded animals for more satisfacory and 

 definite conclusions. 



Experiment. A large rabbit took internally twelve grains of the dried extract. 

 Within an hour he became languid. At the close of two hours he would remain 

 in any strange position in which he might be carefully and gently placed. He 

 could be laid upon his side, or seated on his gluteal muscles in the corner, 

 without an attempt to escape or resist. If disturbed while in these strange 

 postures, or if placed in them suddenly and roughly, he instantly recovered In- 

 activity, and sought to escape, although his efforts were characterized by a 

 certain languor and difficulty which brought him to rest again almost im- 

 mediately. There was, at this period, no change in the pupils. His sensibility 

 was thought to be diminished, since his skin could be pinched sharply without 

 eliciting any expressions of pain. Six hours later no change was perceptible. 

 He wa9 motionless, unless disturbed, when he moved a few steps and then

stopped again, and remained with his head couched on his fore paws. He de- 

 clined food, but drank a little water. Seventeen hours later lie was found 

 dead. His urine contained neither sugar, albumen, nor the coloring matter of 

 the sassy. His stomach contained a mass of hay, lettuce, etc., as is usual with 

 rabbits, whose stomachs are never quite empty. The coloring matter of the 

 sassy seemed to have disappeared, and there was not the least evidence of in- 

 flammatory action in the stomach or intestines. The heart was large and 

 relaxed, the right cavities containing most blood. The blood vessels of the 

 meninges of the brain were considerably injected, but no other abnormal ap- 

 pearances presented themselves. 



Experiment. A small doe rabbit received under the skin of her back eighty 

 drops of the tincture of sassy, previously warmed until it scarcely retained any 

 odor of alcohol, and was thick and turbid. At the same time forty drops were 

 given internally. At the close of half an hour, she was sluggish and unwilling 

 to move, although able to do so when pushed. This torpor gradually increased, 

 the skin became insensitive, the eyes remained half closed, and the limbs ap- 

 peared feeble, especially the hind legs. When roughly shaken, the torpor passed 

 off for a time, and the rabbit even ate a small quantity of lettuce. In a few 

 minutes, however, the animal again sought the corner, and relapsed anew into 

 the sjate of stupor above described. If carefully handled, it was then possible 

 to place the animal on her side, or even to suspend her, head downwards, with- 

 out the least show of resistance or discomfort. During the continuance of these 

 symptoms, the heart beat feebly and the respiration was labored, and sometimes 

 jerking in character. Eighteen hours after receiving the sassy, the rabbit was 

 more active, but not free from a marked languor or difficulty, which appeared 

 in all of her motions. Twenty-five hours after the poisoning, the stupor seemed 

 to have deepened again, and was so profound that the eyes remaiaed nearly 

 closed, and the head, resting on the fore paws, rolled to one side or the other. 

 The rectal temperature was now 102f F., or about one to two degrees below 

 the normal standard. So insensible was the rabbit at this time, that she did 

 not appear to feel the passage of the thermometer bulb through the sphincter, 

 although the operation is usually resisted by all animals with great energy. 

 Within ten minutes she slept again, notwithstanding that the thermometer was 

 still in the bowels. Fifty hours from the date of the first dose, the animal was 

 again reviving. At this time she received I3 of the tincture in the stomach, 

 and 1,5 in the rectum, where it was confined by suitable means, In twenty 

 minutes chewiDg motions of the jaws were observed, the head fell and was 

 caught up again, and at last reposed on the fore paws, the pupils contracted, 

 the heart became slow and irregular, the respiration quick and labored, and at 

 length, in one hour from the last dose, death occurred with general convulsions 

 and sudden dilatation of the pupils. Upon examination, post mortem, the mem- 

 branes of the brain were found to be highly congested, but no other appearance 

 of specific value presented itself. 



Experiment. A small cat received internally five grains of dried extract of 

 sassy. At the close of two hours she was sluggish, and, half an hour later, 

 vomited with great violence. The matters rejected had none of the color of the 

 extract. Another dose of four grains was vomited up within an hour, and ap- 

 parently caused great discomfort, due perhaps to the nausea caused by the 

 drug rather than to pain. The disposition towards stupor, which was seen 

 after the first dose, appeared to be relieved by the emesis. The cat survived, 

 and next day was none the worse for the ordeal. 



Experiment. A large pigeon received, under the skin of the belly, eighty gtt. 

 of the partially evaporated tincture of sassy. At the same time twenty drops of 

 the tincture were given internally. Within half an hour the pigeon sought a 

 corner, and assumed the usual sleeping posture, the eyes closing and the respi- 

 ration being rather uneasy and laborious. Now and then it awoke and stag- 

 gered about, only to sleep again in a few minutes. When thoroughly aroused 



[June, 




Dept,]

by rough shaking, it exhibited more activity. Fifty-five minutes after receiving 

 the sassy, the pigeon vomited very freely. Occasionally, the sleep, into which 

 it always relapsed, became so profound that it staggered and fell down. At the 

 end of two and a half hours the sleep had become comatose, and no agency mid 

 power to break it. Meanwhile the sensibility of the surface was impaired, the 

 respiration suffered, the temperature fell to 97 F. in the cloaca, and death 

 took place, without convulsions, three hours and a half from the time the first 

 dose was given. A second pigeon, similarly treated, except that the doses were 

 smaller, survived twenty-four hours and exhibited no symptoms of importance 

 which have not already been noted, except that at the time of death very slight 

 convulsive movements were seen. 



It was apparently plain, from the above detailed observations, that the sassy 

 bark contained a narcotic, or at least a stupefying principle, and it was also 

 probable that it possessed emetic activity. This, however, could scarcely be 

 inferred from the effect upon the cat or the pigeons, because these animals 

 vomit upon very slight provocation. The experiments upon animals had, how- 

 ever, convinced us that we were dealing with an agent that could be safely 

 used in large doses, and which was certainly not a potent poison. Moreover, it 

 was possible that the emetic effect, observed during its liberal use in half pint 

 doses for ordeal purposes, might be due to the bulk of the infusion, which the 

 person suspected was forced to take. Should this have proved correct, and its 

 emetic powders be really feeble when taken in moderation, we should possess a 

 drug in which co-existed narcotic and astringent activity. Such a remedy 

 would have had a certain value, and, considering the poverty of our pharmaco- 

 poeia in good narcotics, could not have been overlooked. We were also aware 

 that Dr. Thomas Savage, formerly a practising physician on the coast of Africa, 

 had made use of sassy bark in dysentery, but with what effect we were then 

 uninformed. 



With these considerations in view, we resolved to test still further the proper- 

 ties of sassy bark, by experimenting upon ourselves. Accordingly one of U3 

 took, fasting, three and a half grains of dried extract of sassy. Four hour? 

 later he took forty-five drops of the tincture. No effect was perceived, and 

 fourteen hours later he took, fasting, one hundred and twenty drops of the 

 tincture. These repeated doses had no effect, except to interrupt the regular 

 daily action of the bowels. Again, in five hours, another dose of one hundred 

 and twenty drops was taken. Up to this time no symptoms were developed 

 which could be referred with confidence to the effect of the sassy. On a second 

 occasion the same individual took, at one dose, one tablespoonful and a half of 

 the tincture of -sassy bark. This large dose was taken two hours after a light 

 meal, at about 9 p. m. Half an hour afterwards, while engaged in writing, he 

 experienced some little giddiness and slight frontal pain, with a sensation of 

 fulness, chiefly at the front of the head. None of these symptoms were of 

 marked intensity. About ten o'clock the tendency to sleep became so apparent 

 that he ceased writing, in which occupation he had been previously engaged, 

 and left the house in the hope that a brisk walk would lessen the effect of the 

 dose. This proved to be the case, but as the narcotic influence faded, a rapidly 

 increasing nausea took its place, and resulted in violent emesis at one a. m.. 

 five hours after the tincture was employed. In both instances the pulse fell 

 about fifteen beats below the normal standard. 



The effects of the sassy upon another of the authors of this paper is recorded 

 in the following statement: 



At - 11 a. m. he took four drachms of the saturated tincture of sassy. At the 

 time his pulse was ninety-one per minute. He experienced no unusual sensa- 

 tion till about 12 m., when slight dizziness ensued. At this time his pulse was 

 eighty-three. The narcotic influence was not increased, and at 1 p. m, the 

 pulse beat ninety-three. At this hour he took four additional drachms. At 2 

 p. m. his pulse had fallen to eighty, and' the sedative effect was very sensibly

experienced. Repeated the dose. The pulse continued at from eighty to eighty- 

 four till 5 p. m., when it began to rise. At 7 it was ninety-three. After 

 the third dose the narcotic effect was well marked, but was not greater than 

 wSuld have been produced by a grain of opium. The principal feeling was a 

 pleasant lassitude, a desire for quiet, and an indisposition for either mental or 

 physical exertion. 



When the first dose was taken his bowels were slightly loose, and there was 

 some little griping. Both, however, were relieved, and the following morning 

 'he bowels were somewhat constipated. 



Two days after the foregoing experiments he took, at 10 a. m., one ounce of 

 the tincture. Its effect, marked by a decline in the rapidity and force of the 

 pulse, and the feeling of lassitude above mentioned, was experienced in half an 

 '.our. The narcotic was well marked, and was accompanied with headache and 

 slight nausea. The pleasant feelings, experienced with the smaller doses, did 

 not accompany the action of the larger quantity. The pulse remained at from 

 eighty to eighty-five per minute, till about 4 p. m., when the effects began to 

 wear off, although the face was unusually flushed as late as 7 o'clock the same 

 night. 



Upon careful consideration of the foregoing experiments, we are disposed to 

 onclude : 



1. That sassy bark is a feeble narcotic. 



2. That it is nauseant and emetic. 



;;. That it has a marked astringent effect, and that we have seen nothing jus- 

 tifying the belief in the purgative powers ascribed to it by some writers 



II. Pathology. 



Dr. Mitchell related some curious observations made by him, in the course 

 of experiment, as to the effect of sugar in rendering the eyes of frogs cataractous. 



When a solution of sugar is injected into the stomach of a frog, or thrown 

 into the subcuticular cellular tissue of the animal, it becomes torpid and dies. 

 In these cases the eye was observed by Dr. M. to present a cataractous appear- 

 ance. On extracting the lens, the white appearance was found extending into it 

 more or less deeply, as the death had been more or less slow. When the eye 

 was allowed to macerate in water, the appearance of the lens changed and the 

 opacity disappeared.

 I. Anatomy. 



Dr. Schmidt read a communication containing an abstract of the most im- 

 portant points of his researches on the minute anatomy of the human liver. 

 He said : 



During the last 18 months, the greater part of my time has been devoted to 

 the investigation of the microscopic anatomy of the liver. The results of that 

 portion of these investigations which had reference to the minute anatomy of 

 the hepatic lobule, I published in the last January number of the Amer. Journal 

 of Med. Sciences. Continuing my researches, I directed them especially to the 

 general construction of the human liver. Besides having found further evi- 

 dences of the correctness of my observations in reference to the commence 

 ment of the hepatic ducts, I have discovered other interesting facts relating to 

 the liver. These facts, although complicating our idea of the construction of 

 the liver, nevertheless will explain certain phenomena which have been no- 

 ticed long ago by various observers.

As some time will yet elapse before the completion and publication of my 

 next essay on this subject, I wish to give to-night an abstract of the most im- 

 portant points of my researches. It is as follows : 



The parenchyma of the human liver consists of two distinct networks of capilla- 

 ries, with hepatic cells, free nuclei, and granules. These networks of capil- 

 laries are not divided by partitions of fibrous tissue into lobules, but are con- 

 tinuous throughout the whole organ. The meshes which they form are occu- 

 pied by the cells, nuclei, and granules. One of the networks is formed by the 

 ramuscules of the portal vein and hepatic artery, and joins the smallest branches 

 of the hepatic veins. The other commences independently near the smallest 

 branches of the hepatic veins, and is continuous with the finest ramuscules of 

 the hepatic duct, and most probably also with those of the lymphatic vessels of 

 the organ ; so that an injection thrown into the hepatic duct, will return by the 

 latter set of vessels. The capillary vessels forming the last-mentioned net- 

 work I have described in my former paper on the liver, and called ' ' biliary 

 tubules," to distinguish them from the capillaries that carry the blood. 



The whole organ is closely surrounded by a capsule of areolar tissue ; from 

 this, processes are given off which enclose the vessels, ducts, lymphatics and 

 nerves, and thus become their proper sheaths. 



The portal veins, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct, accompanied by lymphatics 

 and nerves, enter the organ in close proximity at its inferior surface ; their lar- 

 ger branches spread out laterally, in a radiating manner, like a fan; some of 

 the vessels, forming the lateral margins of which, run forward, and some 

 backward. The hepatic veins, proceeding from the ascending vena cava, enter 

 the organ posteriorly, and their larger branches run in a postero-anterior di- 

 rection ; but their secondary branches also radiate, and then run almost paral- 

 lel with those of the portal vein and hepatic duct. 



The sheath which surrounds the portal vein, hepatic artery, &c, has usually 

 been known under the name of the "capsule of Glisson;" but as the capsule 

 of the hepatic veins is strictly analogous to it, I shall, for the sake of simplicity, 

 in referring to it, designate it the " capsule of the portal vessels," or "that o 

 the hepatic veins." - * 



Besides the vessels, ducts, lymphatics, and nerves already enumerated' 

 there are in the liver very extensive plexuses, formed by the ducts of racemose 

 glands, which I regard as a special system. This system of glands has been 

 noticed and described to a certain extent by several observers, yet their rela- 

 tionship to the hepatic ducts and lymphatics has to my knowledge never been 

 thoroughly investigated. They are found on the lower surface of the liver, 

 establishing an extensive communication between the larger ducts. They are 

 very abundant on the capsule of the portal vessels, as far as the point where 

 the true interlobular ducts commence, and also exist in the walls of the gall- 

 bladder. The details of this system of glands I shall give in my next essay. 

 For the present, may it suffice to say that their ducts, the diameter of which 

 ranges from l-700th to l-4000th of an inch, anastomose freely with each other 

 and form with branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein (given off within 

 the capsule) a very intricate plexus. From the smallest branches of the lat- 

 ter vessels a capillary rete results, which surrounds the lobules of the glands. 

 Judging from the size of the blood-vessels forming the plexus, the supply of 

 blood to these organs must be very abundant. 



Another set of vessels, or ducts, of a diameter from l-500th to l-2500th of an 

 inch, with single follicular appendages, proceeds from the plexus of racemose 

 glands to communicate freely with the plexus of microscopic lymphatics. 

 These vessels I have also found in the capsule of the hepatic veins. The lobules 

 and larger ducts of the racemose glands are lined by an epithelium of flat 

 hexagonal cells, with large, distinct nuclei, resembling in form and appearance 

 those of the epidermis of the frog.

The interlobular and lobular hepatic ducts do not arise from the glandular 

 plexus, but they can always be traced back to larger ducts. 



In front of the vena cava, where it passes the substance of the liver, I 

 have found a very dense plexus of the peculiar vessels with follicular appen- 

 dages already described, and of others without them. A portion of it, about 

 one inch long and half an inch wide, consisted of several layers of these ves- 

 sels, distinctly enclosed between two layers of the capsule. A network of ar- 

 teries, similar to that found in other parts of the capsule, was seen in the lay- 

 ers of the latter. The plexus itself I observed both in the injected and fresh 

 specimen, communicating or arising from large vessels, which, by a close ex- 

 amination, proved to be the lymphatics of that region, by the valves they pos- 

 sessed. Almost around the whole vena cava at this place, anastomoses of the 

 above described vessels can be seen. 



The description of the microscopic lymphatics of the liver I shall give in my 

 next essay on this subject. 



The interlobular branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery are derived from 

 a plexus which is formed by some of their branches in their capsule. 



Some of the branches of the hepatic artery penetrate to the surface of the 

 liver ; they are tolerably large and anastomose freely with each other in the 

 capsule. From the anastomoses thus formed, .smaller branches proceed, which 

 again in their turn give origin to still smaller ones. The latter vessels, when 

 viewed under a low magnifying power, have the appearance of a broken net- 

 work of large capillaries with large meshes, and as such they have been re- 

 garded and described by other anatomists. However, if examined more closely 

 in well injected specimens, we find that they form no network of their own, but 

 terminate in the capillaries of the lobule. 



The portal vein also sends small branches to the surface, which, however, 

 do not anastomose with each other. They accompany the larger branches of 

 the hepatic artery, (mostly the second set in size, above mentioued, ) to termi- 

 nate likewise in the capillary- network of the lobule. Thus, there exists no other 

 communication between the branches of the hepatic artery and those of the por- 

 tal vein on the surface of the liver, except through the medium of the capillaries 

 of the lobule; and the blood of the artery, instead of returning, to the portal 

 vein, as has been asserted, is with that of the latter discharged into the ca r 

 pillar ies of the lobule, by which route it arrives directly in the branches of the 

 hepatic veins. 



The analogy of the blood vessel on the surface of the liver to those in the 

 interior of the organ I shall prove in my next essay. 



II. Therapeutics. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper, entitled " On the seat of the vesicating principle of the 

 Lytta vinata.'* 



From the experiments detailed in this paper, it appears that the vesicating 

 principle of the Lytta vittata belong to the blood, the peculiar fatty substance of 

 certain accessory glands of the generative apparatus, and to the eggs. 



III. Toxicology. 



Dr. Morris related several cases of poisoning from the sting of the common 

 bee. In one case, a man died in a very short period of time after the injury 

 was received. In this instance the sting was received in the cervical region 

 In a second case, an adult was seized with convulsions, which lasted for a con- 

 siderable time. There was during these convulsions complete opisthotonos. 

 He stated that some thirty or more cases, similar to these, have been reported.

I. Anatomy. 



Dr. Schmidt, with reference to a communication made by him at a meeting 

 held in September, exhibited two livers of sheep, in order to show the method 

 pursued by him, in making his injections. It is as follows : 



The liver is placed in a basin from which the air is exhausted. The appara- 

 tus is so arranged, that, when desired, a communication can be established with 

 the blood vessels. In making an injection, the pressure is exerted chiefly by the 

 weight of the fluid, which is in a column about six inches in height. So soon 

 as the injection is made in this way into the hepatic duct, the fluid used issues 

 from the lymphatics. The injections are also made in a second manner, the 

 organ not being kept in a vacuum. In this, the lymphatics and their glands 

 are also injected, though the pressure of the air prevents the liquid from flow- 

 ing from the opened mouths of the lymphatic vessels, as it does when this 

 pressure is removed. 



In both the preparations exhibited by Dr. Schmidt, one having been injected 

 in a vacuum, the other not, in the way just described, the lymphatic vessels, 

 and also their glands, were seen injected. 



II. Physiology. 

 Dr. Morris read the following paper: 



Remarks on the Digestive Principle. By J. Cheston Morris, M. D. 

 In the course of some observations offered to the Department at the session 

 of June 7th, 1858, on the subject of endosmose, I suggested the hypothesis that 

 during digestion a watery fluid was secreted from the gastric mucous mem- 

 brane, containing a principle which was capable of splitting, or undergoing a fer- 

 mentative change, so as to produce lactic acid and so-called pepsin. I now have 

 the pleasure of laying before the Department the facts necessary to substantiate, 

 that hypothesis. 



When a very dilute solution of ov-albumen is exposed to the air at a moder- 

 ate temperature for several days, it becomes cloudy and has a slightly acid 

 reaction. This change is hastened if air is forced through the solution from 

 time to time. If a small portion of this be added to fresh milk it will cause 

 coagulation of the latter in a short time ; boiling the solution previously, dimin- 

 ishes this property. When a thin portion of coagulated albumen is placed in 

 the solution at a warm temperature, it is dissolved in the course of a few hours ; 

 if the solution be previously boiled, no such change occurs. When the solution 

 is distilled, the distillate yields a white curdy precipitate with nitrate of silver, 

 soluble in an excess of ammonia. 



The above facts correspond so closely, as far as they go, with the properties 

 of the gastric juice that I have no hesitation in stating my belief that they af- 

 ford the explanation of the mode of formation of the latter. We have, in 

 effect, an albuminous fluid in the stomach, placed under appropriate circum- 

 stances as regards oxygen and temperature for the occurrence of fermentative 

 changes ; and if by imitating these conditions out of the body we produce 

 analogous results, we have the strongest reasons for believing that the causes 

 and mode of operation are the same in the living body. 



The foregoing experiment offers also a satisfactory solution of the apparently 

 discrepant views held by different investigators as to the digestion of azotised 

 food. It becomes no longer difficult to comprehend that the gastric juice, the 

 pancreatic fluid, and the intestinal secretion, as well as decomposing albuminoid 

 matters, may all possess the power of causing a solution of coagulated albumen, 

 &c; inasmuch as a splitting of an element common to them all, viz. albumen, 

 gives rise to an acid, (probably lactic,) and a digestive principle. I regret 

 that I have, not been able to make an ultimate analysis of the substance obtained 

 by evaporating the solution above mentioned to dryness at a low temperature. 

 These experiments also set at rest the mooted question of the free acid of the 



1859.] 




20 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [Biolog. 



gastric juice ; proving that the lactic acid developed during the fermentation of 

 albumen is capable of decomposing during distillation the alkaline chlorides 

 found in the white of the egg. 



I should state, however, that I do not regard the above facts as finally con- 

 clusive on the subject. More experiments are required to demonstrate the 

 identity of the principle obtained with pepsin. 



Dr. Woodward objected to considering the ferment thus produced identical 

 or even closely similar to that of the gastric juice. The gastric juice which 

 this fluid was supposed to resemble did not putrify if kept even for months, 

 whereas the solution produced from albumen, as was stated by Dr. Morris, 

 rapidly putrified. So also the peptones did not undergo putrefaction even in a 

 considerable period of time ; the gastric juice acting as an antiseptic, which 

 it appeared from Dr. Morris' statement was not the case with the solution of 

 albumen formed by the new ferment. He suggested the following points for 

 investigation before the similitude should be hastily determined upon. 



1. Is the solution of albumen in the new ferment albuminose, and has it its 

 peculiar reactions ? 



2. Will flesh and similar nitrogenous compounds be dissolved ? 



3. Will the new ferment interfere with the transformation of starch into grape 

 sugar, as does the gastric juice ? 



And, lastly. Is the peculiar fungus of the gastric juice developed in it when 

 kept? 



II. Pathology. 



Dr. Mitchell read a paper, entitled " On the Production of Cataract in Frogs ly 

 the injection of large doses of sugar."* 



November. 

 I. Pathology. 



Dr. Woodward exhibited a specimen of foliaceous crystals of the Phosphates 

 formed during the slow alkaline fermentation of urine in a close stoppered phial. 

 These crystals were remarkable for their huge size, some of them being f- of an 

 inch in length. In chemical behaviour they exactly resembled the smaller 

 sized stellar and foliaceous crystals common to alkaline urine. 



Dr. Woodward also exhibited a specimen of highly acid urine, in which the 

 acid fermentation had been progressing several days, accompanied by a sedi- 

 iment of uric acid. On the surface was a scum of Penicilium glaucum, which 

 entangled in its meshes numerous crystals of the ammoniaco-magnesian phos- 

 phates in fine prisms. This observation, which was the first of the kind he had 

 made, contradicted the general statement made by some, thatphosphatic crystals 

 only fall in alkaline urine.

Dr. Woodward'read a paper entitled " Remarks on errors in the anatomical di- 

 agnosis of Cancer." \

NOTICE. 



In consequence of the increase of size and cost of the Proceedings 

 of the Academy, the subscription price from January, 1860, will be two 

 dollars annually, and the completed volumes for 1857, 8 and 9, will be 

 furnished at two dollars each, and the eight volumes previously pub- 

 lished at two dollars per volume, as heretofore. 



Under authority of the following resolutions, adopted by the Academy, 

 March 29th, and April 26th, 1859, the Committee on the Publication 

 Fund, is prepared to receive subscriptions. 



" Resolved, that the Academy will establish a permanent fund, to be 

 called the Publication Fund, the principal of which shall always be 

 kept invested in good securities, and the interest accruing thereupon 

 shall be applied to the payment of the expenses of publishing such mat- 

 ter, stated or occasional, as the Academy may think proper to issue." 



" Resolved, that every person who shall pay to the Treasurer of the 

 Academy the sum of twenty-five dollars in aid of this fund shall be 

 entitled to receive a copy of the Proceedings during life, and any person 

 who shall in like manner pay the sum of fifty dollars additional, shall 

 be entitled to receive a copy of the Journal during life." 



Your aid in establishing this fund is respectfully requested.
