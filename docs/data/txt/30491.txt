Professor Johnson communicated some observations in 

 relation to the properties and habitudes of different varieties 

 of coal. 



1. He gave the results of some recent analyses of coal, which strongly 

 confirm the position which he had previously advanced, viz.: that in coals from 

 the same coal district, and where that part of the mineral substance which is 

 combustible may be considered as similarly constituted, the density of different 

 specimens may be considered as the index to their relative impurity.

2. He also called attention to the fact that, from the same hand specimen, 

 may often be obtained widely different results by analysis. A small specimen 

 was shown, in which were displayed most decided differences of structure, lustre, 

 colour, character of powder, amount of volatile matter, amount and character of 

 impurities. This was a specimen of coal from the Cumberland coal field of Mary- 

 land — in which a portion was columnar and crystalline in form — of a deep jet 

 black colour, shining and friable, giving abrown powder, and when coked, yielding 

 a highly intumescent porous mass, and leaving, when completely incinerated, only 

 1.754 per cent, of reddish yellow or fawn coloured ashes, exceedingly light, and 

 liable to be carried away by the slightest motion of air. The same part yielded 

 18.28 per cent, of volatile matter, and consequently left 79.966 per cent, of 

 fixed carbon. The other part of the specimen was amorphous in structure, 

 tough in consistence, dull, and almost destitute of lustre, yielding, when com- 

 pletely pulverized, an almost black powder. It gives, when incinerated, 14.736 

 per cent, of ashes, of a greenish white colour, very dense, and cohering slightly 

 when strongly heated. Its volatile matter is 15.976 per cent., and consequently 

 the fixed carbon 69.288. The coke produced swells more or less, according to 

 the rapidity of the application of heat. 



3. He adverted to the designations red and white ash coals, and exhibited 

 proofs that mere analysis, on a minute scale, is liable to mislead us in regard 

 to the true character of the earthy residua of the coals in question. He exhibited 

 a sample of ashes and of clinker, from Lackawanna anthracite, obtained from 

 the combustion of two tons of that coal ; and also a specimen of ashes from the 

 analysis of a hand specimen, — the former being dark brownish red, and the latter 

 almost perfectly white. 



4. He presented evidences of the effect of the rate of heating on the amount 

 and character of the coke produced from a given weight of coal of the same 

 kind, showing that when a brisk and intense action of heat is made the means 



2 




10 [February, 1S44. 



of coking the coal, a considerably greater amount of volatile matter is expelled 

 than when a slow application of heat gradually drives off the matter volatilizable 

 by that principle alone. 



The Chairman announced to the meeting the recent de- 

 cease (on the 10th inst.) of Dr. M. Burrough, late a member 

 of this Institution, and one of its most zealous and active 

 friends, and a large contributor to its collections in all the de- 

 partments of Natural Science. 



Whereupon the following Resol utions, presented by Pro- 

 fessor Johnson, were unanimously adopted: 



Resolved, That the members of this Academy have heard 

 with unfeigned regret of the decease^of our late valued and 

 highly respected member, Dr. Marmaduke Burrough, whose 

 zeal in the cause of JNatural Science, persevering industry in 

 the prosecution of its various departments, and deep interest 

 in the welfare of this Institution, have laid it under numerous 

 and lasting obligations to our deceased associate. 



Resolved, That the members of this Academy deplore the 

 loss of Dr. Burrough, not only as the ardent prosecutor of 

 scientific researches, but as the undeviating man of honor, 

 and highly accomplished gentleman. 



Resolved, That the Vice President of this Society, Dr. 

 S. G. Morton, be requested to communicate to the family of 

 the deceased a copy of the foregoing Resolutions.

 Conrad, Dr. Goddard, and Prof. Johnson. 



A letter was read from Mr. Isaac G. Strain, of the U. S. 

 Navy,* Corresponding Member of the Academy, addressed 

 to Dr. Morton as Vice President, giving the synopsis of the 

 translation, by himself, of a letter from Dr. Lund, of the 

 Royal Society of Antiquarians at Copenhagen, to the Histori- 

 cal and Geographical Society of Brazil, on the subject of 

 some organic remains recently discovered in the calca- 

 reous rocks in the Province of Minas Geraes, Brazil. 



[The interesting and novel information contained in Dr. 

 Lund's letter has induced the Committee on Proceedings to 

 submit for publication the entire translation of Mr. Strain.] 



Rio de Janeiro, 7th December, 1843. 



My Dear Sir, — Knowing the interest you, as well as the other members of 

 the Academy, take in any subject tending to throw light upon the history of 

 the human race, I take the liberty of giving you the synopsis of a translation I 

 have made of a letter addressed by Dr. Lund, of the Royal Society of Anti- 

 quarians at Copenhagen, to the Historical and Geographical Society of Brazil, 

 of which he is an honorary member. 



Dr. Lund has for some time been pursuing his investigations in the Province 

 of Minas Geraes; and has devoted his attention particularly to the fossil 

 remains found in the calcareous rocks of that region. At present he is engaged 

 in the publication of a work entitled, Blik pact Braziliens Dyreverden, or a 

 View of the animal creation which inhabited Brazil immediately preceding the 

 present state of things. The Doctor states it to have been his wish to have 



* Mr. Strain left the United States in the summer of last year in a Govern- 

 ment vessel for South America, as the head of a scientific exploring party into 

 a portion of the interior of that country, and which promises important and 

 interesting results. Mr. S. goes out under the auspices of the U. S. Government, 

 aided also by members of this Institution and other individuals, and is amply fur- 

 nished with every requisite for the successful prosecution of his hazardous and 

 arduous undertaking. Since his arrival at Rio, he has also been fortunate 

 enough to obtain every facility and encouragement from the Imperial Govern- 

 ment. The letter above referred to was written on the eve of his departure on 

 his journey. 




12 [February, 1844. 



published in French; but not being ready, he immediately communicated with 

 the Geographical Institute, with the remark, however, that being written in a 

 language little known, he expects to ensure but few readers. He commences 

 by referring to the question of the coexistence of man with the extinct Terres- 

 trial mammiferous animals, as a point which the JNaturalists of the old world 

 have not been able to resolve decisively : that some few facts appear favourable 

 to an affirmative, but more to a negative solution ; that, though he has had an 

 opportunity to submit the question to a new examination in this part of the 

 world, he has not had proofs to arrive at a definite result, although his labors in 

 Zoology have terminated most happily. The geological archives of the history of 

 our planet are found (says the learned Doctor) in the caverns of the calcareous 

 rocks, which enter, as a constituent part, into the most extensive formations in the 

 interior of Brazil. The animals whose remains he has met, are for the most part 

 different from those which actually exist on the surface, showing that they be- 

 longed to a distinct creation. 



He has already examined nearly two hundred caverns. The species of 

 animals he has examined, of the mammiferous class alone, number one hundred 

 and fifteen, which much exceeds the number now existing of this class, which 

 he has reduced to eighty-eight. 



From the mutilated state in which they were generally found, it appears pro- 

 bable they owe their introduction to the beasts of prey of those times — the 

 denizens of those caverns — who carried them there to devour them. In the 

 midst of these testimonials of an order of things differing from the actual, he 

 had not the slightest vestige of the existence of man ; and if man had existed, 

 how could he have escaped the fate of animals stronger than he, who were vic- 

 tims of these ferocious and gigantic beasts of prey. This evidence he thought 

 sufficient to decide the question negatively, when he unexpectedly met the first 

 remains of the human species under circumstances- which, at least, admit of a 

 contrary solution. He found these remains in a cavern which contained mixed 

 with them bones of animals decidedly extinct ; (Platyonix Bucklandii, Chlamy- 

 dotherium Humboltii, C. majus, Dasypus sulcatus, Hydrochaerus sulcidens, 

 &c.) a circumstance which ought to call attention to these interesting relics. 

 Besides, they present all the characters of really fossil bones. They were in 

 part petrified, and in part penetrated with iron particles, which gave to them a 

 metallic lustre, resembling bronze, and at the same time an extraordinary 

 weight. Of the immense age of these remains there can be no doubt ; but, upon 

 the question of the coexistence with animals whose remains were found with 

 them, we cannot, unfortunately, arrive at a definite conclusion, as the cave is 

 situated on the margin of a lake whose waters rise annually, and in the rainy 

 season enter it ; so it is possible the remains of animals, now existing, might 

 have been more recently introduced, and mixed with those already deposited. 

 These bones are in different states of preservation ; some differing little from 

 new bones, while others approximate to the sub-metallic state already referred 

 to ; but the greater number occupy a grade of decomposition intermediate be- 

 tween the two extremes. 



A similar difference, but less conceivable, he noted among the human bones, 




February, 1S44.] 13 



proving a diversity of ages, while all showed an antiquity ; making them most 

 interesting, even if they do not solve the question of coexistence. In Europe, 

 (says the Doctor,) the remains of the gi of terrestrial mammiferous 



animals are the only proof of their existence; as no mention is made of them in 

 history, consequently their extinction dates back more than three thousand years. 

 Applying the same result to the extinct species of Brazil, with which they agree 

 in their state, and atttibuting to the human bones found in a state perfectly 

 analogous to those which characterise these fossils, we take for them an age of 

 thirty centuries and upward. Admitting, then, the proofs of these documents, 

 the population of Brazil is derived from very remote times, and undoubtedly 

 anterior to the time of history. 



The question then arises, who were these people? what their mode of life? 

 of what race 1 and what their intellectual perfection] The answers to these 

 questions are, happily, less difficult and doubtful. He examined various crania, 

 more or less perfect, in order to determine the place they ought to occupy in the 

 system of Anthropology. The narrowness of the forehead, the prominence of 

 the zygomatic bones, the facial angle, the maxillary and orbital conformation, all 

 assign to these crania a place among the characteristics of the American race. 

 And it is known, says the Doctor, in continuation, that the race which approxi- 

 mates nearest to this is the Mongolian ; and the most distinctive and salient 

 character by which we distinguish between them, is by the greater depression 

 of the forehead of the former. In this point of organization, these ancient crania 

 show not only the peculiarity of the American race, but this peculiarity, in many 

 instances, in an excessive degree; even to the entire disappearance of the fore- 

 head. We must allow, then, that the people who occupied this country in those 

 remote times, were of the same race as those who inhabited it at the time of the 

 conquest. We know that the human figures found sculptured in the ancient 

 monuments of Mexico represent, for the greater part, a singular conformation 

 of head, — being entirely without forehead, — the cranium retreating backward im- 

 mediately above the superciliary arch. This anomaly, which is generally attri- 

 buted to an artificial disfiguration of the head, or the taste of the artist, now 

 admits a more natural explanation; it being now proved, by these authentic 

 documents, that there really existed on this continent a race exhibiting this ano- 

 malous conformation. The skeletons, which were of both sexes, were of the 

 ordinary height, although two of the men were above the common stature. 

 These heads, according to the received opinions in Craniology, could not have 

 occupied a high position in intellectual standing. This opinion is corroborated 

 by finding an instrument of imperfect construction joined with the skeletons. 

 This instrument is simply a smooth stone, of about ten inches in circumference, 

 evidently intended to bruise seeds or hard substances. 



In other caverns he has found other human bones, which show equally the 

 characteristics of fossils, being deprived of all the gelatinous parts, and conse- 

 quently very brittle and porous in the fracture. They were, unfortunately, un- 

 accompanied by the bones of any other animals, so that the principal point of 

 the question remains undecided ; although they go to prove the antiquity and 

 prolonged existence of the human race on this continent. 




14 [February, 1S44. 



The above then, my clear Sir, is a brief synopsis of Dr. Lund's letter, which 

 may, perhaps, have already reached you by way of Europe; but of this I am 

 not assured, and have determined to send it. 



Having given you the general features of this letter, it would be presumptuous 

 in me to hazard any remarks to one so skilled in Anthropology; and I would 

 only suggest, that fossil remains are not confined to Minas Geraes, but are also 

 found in the western part of this Province, and in Bahia. 



Near the city of Rio de Janiero of course nothing of the kind has been dis- 

 covered, as the formation is entirely Granitic ; but from the point where the 

 calcareous rocks commence, (about ninety miles inland, near Canto Gallo,) I 

 am informed that fossils are abundant. 



I take this opportunity to express my thanks to you, personally, and the 

 members of the Academy generally, for the honor conferred by my election as a 

 corresponding member, and for the kind interest they have taken in my enter- 

 prise, and

On a supposed New Species of Hippopotamus. 



By S. G. Morton, M. D. 



It is about six months since I received from my friend Dr. 

 Goheen an extensive series of skulls, of mammiferous and other 

 animals, from Western Africa. They had been obtained by him 

 during a residence of several years at Monrovia, where he had 




February, 1844.] 15 



officiated as Colonial Physician; a situation which gave him 

 great advantages for procuring the natural productions of that 

 region. Among these crania were two of a Hippopotamus, of 

 small size, from the river St. Paul's. Although nothing could 

 be more manifest than the difference between the head of this 

 animal and that of the common species, I have hesitated to pub- 

 lish it, from a fear that some one else may already have done so; 

 for I could hardly convince myself that so remarkable a species 

 was wholly unnoticed in the systems. Having, however, searched 

 the latest European works on Zoology without finding any 

 account of this interesting animal, I venture to submit the follow- 

 ing facts in relation to it.

These measurements have been taken from a very old indi- 

 vidual, in which the sutures are entirely obsolete, and the teeth 

 worn almost to the level of the jaw; and the contrast in size, be- 

 tween this and the large or common species, (familiar to every 

 one as the H. amphibius, but recently divided into two species, 

 the H. capensis and H. Senegalensis,) will be manifest to every 

 one. The difference, however, is not only in size, but in 




16 



[February, 1844. 



all the proportions of the head, as the subjoined drawings will 

 show. 



In the H. minor there is a uniform convexity of the upper sur- 

 face of the cranium, from orbit to orbit, and between the occiput 

 and ossa nasi ; while in the common species the orbits are re- 

 markably elevated, and the intermediate surface is concave. The 

 orbit is placed about midway between the occiput and snout, and 

 the latter is consequently short ; while in the large species the orbits 

 are placed about one-third the distance between the occiput and 

 snout. The H. minor has only two canines in the lower jaw ; 

 the false molars are proximate to the canines ; and the base of 

 the zygoma? is in the same plane with the upper maxilla. 



The second skull of this species (which is of the same length 

 as the other) is that of a younger animal ; for the sutures are 

 open, and the teeth in the process of changing from the deciduous 

 to the permanent set. The posterior molars are only partially

protruded, and rise obliquely from the jaws, like those of the 

 Elephant and Mastodon. 



Dr. Goheen, who assured me from the first that he could find 

 no notice of this animal in the systematic works, has obligingly 

 favoured me with the following memorandum in relation to it. 

 " This animal abounds in the river St. Paul's, and varies in 

 weight from four hundred to seven hundred pounds. They are 

 slow and heavy in their motions, yet will sometimes stray two or 

 three miles from the river, in which situation they are killed by 

 the natives. They are extremely tenacious of life, and almost 

 invulnerable, excepting when shot or otherwise wounded in the 

 heart. When injured they become irritable and dangerous, but 

 are said by the natives never to attack them when in their canoes. 

 The negroes are very fond of the flesh, which seems to be inter- 

 mediate in flavor between beef and veal." 



My comparisons with the common Hippopotamus have been 

 made on four specimens, (three of which are fully grown,) two 

 from the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, and two from the 

 Senegal river. 



The Chevalier Amedeo Avogardo, of Turin, was then 

 elected a Correspondent of the Academy.

DONATIONS TO MUSEUM. 



Forty-seven species of Plants of Missouri, including several 

 species of Cuscuta recently described by Dr. Engelmann, 

 of St. Louis ; and also several of Torrey & Gray's new

 Engelmann. 



One hundred and ninety specimens of Coleopterous, Hemip- 

 terous, Lepidopterous, and other insects, from the vicinity 

 of Newark, Delaware. Collected and presented by Dr. 

 Thomas B. Wilson, of Newark. 



Mr. T. R. Peale presented a travelling case from the Sand- 

 wich Islands, formed of sections of a gourd of large size. 



Mr. Cassin stated a fact, which he considered as worthy 

 of record: that, during the past winter, the Snow Owl (Strix 

 nyctea, L., Nyctea Candida, Sw.) had been observed in the 

 vicinity of Philadelphia, and in the adjoining states of New 

 Jersey and Delaware, in numbers unusually great for this 

 latitude. At a moderate calculation, he supposed that not less 

 than one hundred specimens had been shot and exposed for 

 sale in the markets, and at a very trifling price. Several of 

 them had been seen for many days successively upon the

roofs of houses, chimney tops, and other elevated places, in 

 the city itself, during the very severe weather of January. 



As this is a bird almost exclusively confined to extreme 

 northern latitudes, its appearance here, in such large num- 

 bers, is to be solely attributed to the great severity of the 

 season to the North,

Descriptions of New Species of North American Coleoptera. 

 By John L. Le Conte.* 



1. Galeiiita dubia. Nob. Length 9 lines, breadth 3y lines. 



Head black, frontal impressions oblong, shallow ; palpi and first joint of the 

 antenna; ferruginous ; remainder of the latter brown. 



Thorax ferruginous; posterior transverse impression tolerably marked, straight; 

 longitudinal line very slight : basal impressions shallow. Elytra black, striae 

 impunctate, beneath dark brown ; legs and under part of the thorax ferruginous. 

 Inhabits Georgia. 



Differs from G. Le Contei, Dej., in not having a red spot on the head, and in 

 the basal impressions of the thorax, which are shallower ; from G. bicolor, Drury, 

 (G. Americana, Dej.,) in having the longitudinal line of the thorax less im- 

 pressed, and the posterior transverse impression more distinct. The thorax is 

 also less retracted posteriorly : it differs from all the other species in having the 

 stria? of the elytra impunctate. 



2. Plochionus vittatus. Nob. Length 4 lines, breadth If lines. Ferrugi- 

 nous ; tips of mandibles and eyes black ; frontal impressions oval, very deep : 

 thorax covered with transverse wrinkles ; transverse impressions scarcely visible; 

 longitudinal line entire, deeply marked ; basilar impressions deep, oblong, and 

 transverse : a wide and deep fovea impressed on each side near the middle of the 

 thorax ; lateral margin widely depressed towards the posterior angles. 



Elytra, with a broad black sutural vitta, and a lateral spot of the same colour 

 behind the middle : stria? deep, impunctured. Body and legs dark ferruginous. 

 Inhabits Florida. 



3. Aptinus americanus. Dej. Cat. Length 5f lines ; breadth 2^ lines. 

 Head, thorax, and legs ferruginous. Antenna; ferruginous, growing dusky 



towards the extremity. Head smooth, with a deep and long longitudinal impres- 

 sion between the eyes ; eyes black. Thorax sparsely punctured ; transverse im- 

 pressions none : longitudinal line well marked ; with a few transverse wrinkles 

 on each side. 



Elytra bluish-black, costse smooth ; intervals deep, wide, and punctured. 

 Sternum ferruginous ; abdomen very dark brown, almost black. Inhabits" 

 Georgia. 



Resembles much in form and size Brachijtus quadripennis, but it is narrower, 

 and the elytra are less parallel. 



4. Biiachinus strenuus. Nob. Length 7$ lines ; breadth 3| lines. 

 Head, antenna;, palpi, thorax, sternum, and legs ferruginous; abdomen dark 



brown, with a reddish spot in the middle of the upper part : head sparsely punctate, 

 particularly at the posterior part. Thorax scarcely wider than the head, thickly 

 punctured.

April, 1844.] 49 



Elytra bluish-black, punctured ; interstices of the costs narrow at the bottom. 

 Inhabits Georgia. (Common.) 



Resembles both the fumans, Fabr., and Vibrator, He].; but the thorax is nar- 

 rower and more rounded anteriorly than the former, and less so than the latter. 

 The head is larger and the frontal impressions broader than in either ; the anten- 

 na? are thicker and darker than in the fumans, but want the dark spots observable 

 on those of the librator. The elytra are wider, the interstices are deeper than 

 in either, and wider than in the fumans. 



5. Brachinus Le Contei. Dej. Cat. Length 6 lines ; breadth 2|- lines. 

 Inhabits Georgia. 



Resembles the viridlpennis, Dej., and perplexus, Dej.; the former in size and 

 form, the latter in form, but is easily distinguished by the frontal impressions, 

 which are shallow and punctate ; in the viridipennis they are still shallower and 

 more punctate : in the perplexus they are rugous ; the first two joints of the 

 antennas and base of third and fourth, are ferruginous ; tips of these last are 

 brown ; in both the remainder is brown, but in the perplexus the third only is 

 brown at the tip. The thorax is wider before ; the anterior angles are sharper 

 and more projecting. Elytra deep blue to blackish blue. Abdomen deep reddish 

 brown. 



6. Brachinus cyanopterus. Dej. MS. Length 5§ lines ; breadth 2f 

 lines. Inhabits New York. 



Resembles the cordicollis, but is larger, and easily distinguished by the deeper 

 and brighter blue of the elytra: the antenna? are likewise ferruginous, without 

 spots, growing darker towards the extremity. The thorax is rather narrower 

 anteriorly, and the costse of the elytra are more apparent. Abdomen red, sides 

 brownish. 



7. Brachinus viridis. Nob. Length 6 lines ; breadth 2J lines. Inhabits 

 Georgia. 



Resembles the viridipennis, but is narrower ; the thorax is not so much 

 rounded on the sides, the basal impressions are more distinct. The elytra are 

 of a paler and brighter green, more thickly and coarsely punctured ; the costa? 

 are more strongly marked. The first two joints of the antenna? and a spot on 

 the third are ferruginous; in the viridipennis the first three and sometimes 

 the four are ferruginous, with a small brown spot on the third and fourth. 



8. Brachinus neglectus. Nob. Length 5J lines ; breadth 2£ lines. 

 Inhabits Georgia. 



Somewhat resembles the quadripennis, but is larger and proportionably 

 broader ; the elytra are of the same bluish-black colour, but less rounded at the 

 anterior angles, they are more distinctly costate, and the intervals are nar- 

 rower. The first two joints of the antenna? are ferruginous, and the rest brown, 

 whilst in the quadripennis the base of the third is also ferruginous. The thorax 

 is also more retracted posteriorly, and the anterior angles more acute ; the basal 

 impressions are prolonged and extend almost to the middle of the thorax. 



9. Brachinus tenuicollis. Nob. Length 6 lines ; breadth 2| lines. 




50 [April, 1S44. 



Also resembles ihe quadripennis, but the elytra are more blue, and the first 

 five costs of the elytra are more apparent than the rest, and are impunctured on 

 the top. The first two joints of the antennae and base of the third are ferru- 

 ginous, the rest brown. Sides of the head coarsely punctured, frontal impres- 

 sions longer, more rugous and more punctured. The thorax is more retracted 

 posteriorly, wider and more rounded anteriorly. 



10. Brachinus patruelis. Dej. Cat. Length 4£ lines ; breadth ljj. In- 

 habits New York. 



Resembles somewhat B. cordicollis, but the frontal impressions are longer ; 

 first three joints of antennae and base of fourth ferruginous ; the third has a 

 small brown spot at the extremity, and the remaining joints are also brown. In 

 the cordicollis the two first and base of the third only are ferruginous: thorax 

 much wider and more rounded anteriorly. Elytra bright blue, costae slight, and 

 much less elevated than in the cordicollis. 



11. Scarites otus. Nob. 12. S. ephialtes. Nob. 13. S. intermedins. 

 Nob. 14. S.affmis. Nob. 15. S. subterraneous. Fabr. 16. S.affinis. Nob. 

 (As we intend publishing a monograph of these species in a few weeks, it will 

 be useless to add descriptions here.) 



17. Clivina impressifrons. Nob. Length 3; lines ; breadth § line. 

 Dark rufous : front with three wide and deep longitudinal impressions, the 



middle one abbreviated at the ends, so as to form an oblong fovea. Thorax ob- 

 long, rounded behind ; but little convex ; longitudinal line deeply impressed. 

 Elytra narrower than the thorax, parallel : striate, striae punctate : third interval 

 with three impressed points. Inhabits New York. 



Resembles C. rufescens: but differs from it in being larger, in having the 

 front deeply impressed, and the elytra narrower than the thorax. 



18. Clivista convexus. Nob. Length 2\ lines ; Breadth § line. 



Head and thorax black; the latter convex and round : anterior transverse im- 

 pression scarcely visible : median line distinct. 



Elytra piceous, with a large transverse rufous sutural spot near the extremity : 

 deeply striate ; striae strongly punctate, with but one impressed point on the 

 third interval, near the extremity. Inhabits Georgia. 



Resembles the C. bipustulatus ,- but is readily distinguished by its rounded 

 thorax and the very slight anterior transverse impression. 



19. Rembus striatopunctatus. Nob. Length 6j} lines; breadth 3|. 

 Black, shining : palpi black, with the extremity of each articulation rufous ; 



antennse blackish-brown : frontal impressions deep, incurved at the middle, as in 

 the impresskollis. Medial line of the thorax deeply impressed, and abbreviated 

 at both ends : transverse impressions indistinct, basal ones deep, with an inwardly 

 deep cut furrow beyond the middle. 



Elytra striate ; strim punctate : the second one incurved at the tip : the third 

 and fourth and fifth and sixth united at the tip ; interstices convex, with an 

 impressed point on the middle of the third rudimental striae, a mere point between 

 first and second stria. Inhabits Pennsylvania. Found at Carlisle by S. F. 

 Baird. 




April, 1844.] 51 



Differs from R. impressicollis in the transverse impressions of the thorax 

 which in that species are very distinct, also in ihe basal impressions and in the 

 striae of the elytra being very distinctly punctured : in the impressicollis they 

 are quite smooth. It is a much larger insect. 



20. Rembcs assimilis. Nob. Length 5| lines; breadth 2 J lines. 

 Black, shining; palpi and antennae dark ferruginous brown: head as in the 



preceding: medial line of the thorax deep: anteriorly abbreviated; posteriorly 

 reaching to the base; posterior transverse impression deeply marked in the middle: 

 striae of the elytra punctate: the second not incurved ; third interval with an 

 impressed point in the middle : an indistinct rudiment of a strife at the base 

 between the first and second. Inhabits Georgia. 



At first sight this insect strongly resembles an anisodaetylus, but it possesses 

 all the characters of the genus to which I have referred it. 



21. Chijenius congener. Nob. Length 7 3 lines; breadth 3 lines. 



Head and thorax coppery, with a greenish tint, the punctures on the latter 

 large and confluent. The thorax obcordate, slightly narrowed behind ; medial 

 line deeply impressed, abbreviated anteriorly, and not reaching posteriorly farther 

 than the posterior transverse impression, which is very deep and strongly mark- 

 ed : basal impressions very deep, oblong, rather inclining inwards : elytra black, 

 with a tinge of blue, striae scarcely punctate ; body beneath black, palpi, first 

 three joints of antennas and legs ferruginous. In other respects same as C. 

 cobaltinus. Inhabits Georgia. 



Closely resembles C. cobaltinus,- but is easily distinguished by the transverse 

 posterior impression of the thorax, which is much deeper. The medial line 

 does not extend so far backwards, and the elytral strise are scarcely punctate. 



22. Ch-ljetsivs patruelis. Dej. Cat. Length 6} — 7 lines; breadth 2| — 

 3 lines. 



Above green, beneath black; antenna; and legs ferruginous. Head coarsely 

 punctured, particularly at the posterior part ; frontal impressions distinct. Tho- 

 rax very coarsely punctate, much longer than wide, narrowed before and behind, 

 subcordate, much curved on the sides : medial line on account of the close and 

 deep punctures not very apparent : basal impressions deep and triangular. 

 Elytra much wider than the thorax, covered with a short reddish pubescence; 

 strise punctured ; intervals plane, covered with fine and close punctures. Inhabits 

 Georgia. 



Resembles slightly the sericeus, but is distinguished at first sight by its narrow 

 thorax. 



23. Badister. terminate. Nob. Length 2£ lines ; breadth £ lines. 



Head, thorax, and body beneath black : palpi, antennas, coxas and legs ferrugin- 

 ous, frontal impressions of the head, very large and shallow. Thorax smooth, 

 obcordate, the angles rounded, the posterior less than the anterior: transverse im- 

 pressions well and deeply marked the anterior incurved : longitudinal line entire 

 and deep : rounded posterior margin a little elevated and reddish. Elytra smooth, 

 piceous, with the margin suture, and large spot at the base ferruginous, gradu- 




52 [April, 1S44. 



ally changing into the piceous colour of the remainder. Stria? very indistinctly 

 punctured. Third interval with three impressed points rather indistinct. In- 

 habits New York. 



24. Badisteii testaceus. Nob. Length 2 lines ; breadth | lines. 

 Smooth, shining, testaceous, inclining to piceous o n head and elytra : joints of 



the antennae gradually increasing in thickness to the extremity: frontal impres- 

 sions deep and rounded. Thorax obcordate, lengthened, scarcely wider than 

 the head ; anterior angles rounded, posterior acute, anterior transverse impression 

 tolerably marked, posterior one obsolete : longitudinal line well marked and en- 

 tire: basal impressions deep, oblong. Elytra wider than the thorax, parallel, 

 almost plane, deeply striate, stria? impunctured, sides of the strife covered with 

 small transverse wrinkles a little oblique, which cutting the stria?, give them an 

 almost reticulated appearance. Inhabits Pennsylvania. 



25. Badisteii micans. Nob. Length 4 J- lines ; breadth 1| lines. 



Black: head, rhinariurn, and upper lip testaceous, palpi ferruginous, with a 

 black spot on the last joint : antenna? brown, the first two joints rufous : frontal 

 impressions rather larger, distinct : an impressed point near each eye. Thorax 

 plane black, margined with rrddish brown :"the margin sinuate near the posterior 

 angles : base rugous : transverse impressions tolerably distinct. Longitudinal 

 lirje deeply marked. Basal impressions large and deep. Elytra piceous, irri- 

 descent, not sinuate at the extremity ; stria? tolerably deep, impunctured : inter- 

 vals broad and plane. Third interval with two impressed points. Body beneath 

 piceous, legs testaceous. Inhabits Georgia. 



This insect differs very much in its general appearance from all the species of 

 this genus, and it may perhaps be necessary hereafter to separate it from the 

 genus in which I have placed it. 



26. Ootjes picipes. Nob. Length 5h lines ; breadth 2\ lines. 

 Resembles the americanus, but is smaller ; the palpi and antenna? are entirely 



piceous ; the thorax is more convex ; the posterior transverse impression is scarcely 

 visible ; the longitudinal line almost obsolete : basal impressions very shallow and 

 indistinct : the elytra are more deeply striate ; and the stria? are impunctate; the 

 third interval with two impressed points : underside of the body black ; legs 

 piceous. Inhabits Georgia. 



27. PniSTONYcnus americanus. Nob. Length 5 1-6 lines ; breadth 1£ lines. 

 Apterous; black, shining; beneath smooth; palpi, antenna?, and legs dark 



ferruginous ; frontal impressions tolerably deep and slightly rugous ; thorax, ob- 

 long, almost square, wider than the head, narrowed behind, the anterior angles 

 projecting, posterior ones rounded ; covered with very slight transverse undulating 

 wrinkles: lateral margin elevated posteriorly ; the base cut almost square: ante, 

 rior transverse impression small, incurved ; posterior deeply marked ; mesian line 

 deep, abbreviated at each end by the transverse impressions, the anterior of which 

 cuts it at right angles : basal impressions oblong, deep, slightly rugous. 



Elytra wider than the thorax, lightly convex ; not sinuated at the extremity '■> 

 deeply striate; stria? impunctured, with two impressed points on the third inter- 




April, 1844.] 53 



val, near tho second strife: rudimental strife at the base, short and straight; 

 epiplcurrr, with a longitudinal elevation near the base. Inhabits Georgia. 



28. Calathfs dislingucnidus. Nob. Length 5\ lines ; breadth 2 lines. 

 Piceous black, shining, smooth ; palpi, antennre and legs ferruginous ; front 



with a small impression at the base of the antennre, and a linear one near the 

 eyes: thorax smooth, with some indistinct transverse undulating wrinkles, 

 quadrangular, narrowed before, the anterior angles projecting and a little 

 rounded, base cut square, so as to make the posterior angles almost right, 

 lateral margin rufo-piceous, a little curved, dilated, and depressed posteriorly ; 

 anteriorly ; anterior transverse impression tolerably distinct : posterior well 

 marked ; medial line slight, abbreviated by the transverse impressions ; with the 

 anterior of which it forms an angle, so as to leave a well denned triangular de- 

 pression in front; basal impressions slight, scarcely distinct from the depressed 

 base of the thorax. 



Elytra striate, strife impunctured, with three impressed points on the third 

 interval, the two upper ones near the third, the lower one close to the extremity 

 of the second strife. Inhabits Georgia. 



Larger than C. gregarius, which it very much resembles ; the thorax, and its 

 margins are proportionally much wider, more curved, and more reflexed; and it 

 wants the impressed point on each side of the thorax near the margin, which 

 is very apparent in the gregarius : the anterior transverse impression is strongly 

 marked, whereas in C. gregarius, it is much less apparent. It is also much 

 darkened beneath. 



29. Anchomenus he Contei. Dej. Cat. Length 9 J lines; breadth 2 lines. 

 Very much resembles the A. exlensicollis ; but differs in the thorax being 



wider, and more rounded : the basal impressions are longer, perpendicular to the 

 base, and curving upwardly and outwardly ; whilst in the extenskollls they are 

 oblique, so as to make them wider at the base ; from this last circumstance the 

 middle of the base between the impressions is much wider in A. he Contei than 

 in A. extensicollis. 



It may, however, prove to be nothing' more than a variety.

 anterior pair ; thorax lightly margined with yellow anteriorly ; tarsi fuscous. 

 Somewhat larger than E. verticalis, Say, and distinguished by the almost uni- 

 form black colour, and the base of the abdomen being fusiform, on account of 

 the depth of the incisure. 



Scaphinotus Jlammeus. Reddish brown, head slightly transversely rugose 

 between the antennas ; pronotum proportionally wider, and the profile flatter 

 above when viewed laterally than in S. elevatus : elytra coarsely punctate striate, 

 sinuate at tip, pale brilliant violet, with the margin, and several tarnished spots 

 of green. 10 lines long. 



An imperfect specimen in the cabinet of the Academy, from Marietta, Ohio. 

 Distinguished from S. elevatus by the wider prothorax and elytra, and lighter 

 colour. Not having seen a female of the latter, I am unable to point out its dis- 

 tinction from the proposed species.

Descriptions of new species of African Reptiles. 



By Edward Hallowell, M. D.* 



Genus Euprepis, Dum. and Bibron. 



E. Blandingii. The head is of moderate size, triangular, narrow, 

 flattened above ; the snout is somewhat prolonged and rounded in 

 front ; the plates upon the upper surface of the head, as well as 

 those upon the sides are perfectly smooth ; the rostral plate is 

 large, pentagonal, presenting an obtuse angle at its summit ; the 

 nasal plates are of moderate size, triangular, rounded posteriorly ; 

 the supero-nasal are narrow, oblong, in contact with each other; 

 the. inter-nasal plate is larger, presenting the form of a lozenge 

 with its lateral angles truncated, the posterior angle is acute, the 

 anterior obtuse ; it is in contact in front with the two supero-nasal 

 plates, its anterior angle not reaching quite so far as the rostral ; 

 the fronto-nasal are of moderate size, sub-pentagonal, their lateral 

 and inferior margins are in contact with the superior margin of 

 the two frenal plates ; the freno-nasal plate is small, triangular ; 

 the first of the frenal plates is oblong-quadrilateral; the second, 

 which is much the larger of the two, is pentagonal ; the frontal 

 plate is pentagonal, much broader in front, rounded posteriorly; 

 the fronto-parietal are oblong pentagonal, their anterior margins, 

 or those which embrace the posterior margins of the frontal, are the 

 smallest; they are in contact laterally with the two supra-orbitar, 

 and posteriorly with the parietal and inter-parietal plates ; the 

 parietals are large, pentagonal ; the inter-parietal is larger than 

 either of the fronto-parietals, and terminates posteriorly in an ob- 

 tuse point; there are four supra-orbitar and two freno-orbitar 

 plates ; the supra-orbitar are four in number, their exterior mar- 

 gin is bordered by a row of seven small oblong quadrangular 

 plates; immediately behind them is a small rhomboidal plate, the 

 upper half of which is received between the posterior supra-or-

bitar and the parietal plate ; there is no occipital, but immediately 

 behind the parietal are two oblong scales, much larger than the 

 rest, presenting numerous striae, or elevated lines upon their pos- 

 terior margin ; the labial plates are seven in number, of these the 

 fifth is most remarkable, it is regularly quadrilateral, oblong, and 

 much larger than either of the others, forming of itself one-half 

 of the inferior margin of the orbit; the second, third and fourth, 

 are rhomboidal ; the first is irregularly quadrilateral ; the sixth 

 and seventh are pentagonal ; the ear is of moderate size ; its in- 

 ferior margin is bordered with numerous small granules, and 

 there are two or three small scales in front ; the scales upon the 

 body are hexagonal, more or less rounded posteriorly ; those upon 

 the back, sides, and tail, present fine carina? upon their surface, 

 all of which are very distinct ; here and there a smaller one may 

 be observed at each extremity of a scale; there are eight scales 

 immediately in front of the anus of nearly equal size. 



Colour. The head, back, and upper part of the tail is of a bronze 

 colour, with numerous spots of black ; these spots are more abun- 

 dant, and somewhat larger upon the upper part of the tail ; there 

 is a row of white spots extending along the side of the neck and 

 body as far as the extremity of the tail ; a broad black band 

 passes along the side of the body, and one immediately behind 

 the orbit as far as the posterior extremities, becoming indistinct 

 upon the tail ; immediately below this is a white narrow vitta, 

 commencing near the anterior extremity of the orbit and termina- 

 ting in a line with the inferior extremity of the forearm when 

 placed in contact with the side of the body ; under surface of chin, 

 throat, abdomen and extremities of a light silvery gray colour, 

 slightly tinged with green ; a number of small conglomerated 

 spots of a black colour are observed upon the chin.

me by my friend Dr. W. Blanding. It resembles, if my memory 

 be correct, (not having the work now by me,) a South African 

 species described by Dumeril and Bibron, but I believe it to be 

 distinct. The description is taken from a specimen preserved in 

 spirits. 



Genus Ixalus, Dum. and Bibron. 



I, concolor. Head large, triangular, flattened above, snout 

 slightly rounded, nostrils small, situated very near the mouth; 

 eyes large, rather prominent ; tympanum small but distinct, open-

Slated Meeting, May 14, 1844. 

 Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



Two letters were read from Mr. I. G. Strain, U. S. Navy, 

 Correspondent of the Academy, (now on an exploring tour 

 through the interior of South America,) addressed to Mr. 

 Phillips and Dr. Morton, dated City of St. Paul's, Brazil, 

 February 2Glh, 1S44 ; of which the following is ah abstract: 



The party had been reduced to three, Mr. Strain, Dr. Rein- 

 hart, and Mr. Christie, the others having left them from sick- 

 ness and other causes. After having reached the head of 

 navigation on the river Tiete, it was ascertained that the un- 

 healthiness of the country through which they would pass in 

 descending that river, was such as to threaten the lives of the. 

 party ; the natives positively refusing to accompany them in 

 the descent, and, without some assistance, the canoes could 

 not be dragged over the portages. In consequence of this, 

 the route was changed, and preparations made to descend the 

 Parana-Panema, which has remained unexplored. A covered 

 boat, twenty-two feet long and four feet beam, was built by 

 the party, and every preparation made to commence the de- 

 scent of the river in a few days. Dr. Reinhart had made 

 numerous collections in various departments of natural science, 

 although he was principal constructor of their little boat, 

 which was so constructed as to be taken to pieces should it be 

 required. Mr. Strain had made two journeys to distant cities, 

 to complete arrangements for his expedition with the officers- 

 of the government, and had at length returned, found all 

 ready, and the little party was on the eve of starting, in ex- 

 cellent health and spirits, and full of hope and confidence. 



A letter was read from Mr. James Ombrosi, U. S. Consul 

 at Florence, Italy, dated February, 1S44, acknowledging the 

 reception of his diploma, and announcing his intention of pro- 

 curing for the Academy, and forwarding by the earliest op- 

 portunity, certain publications of learned Italian Societies.

Dr. Morton exhibited the skull of a Hottentot, sent him by 

 Mr. T. Watson, (now resident near the Cape of Good Hope,) 

 through Dr. Gavin Watson, of this city. This is a female 

 head, remarkable for having the Negro characteristics very 

 strongly expressed. The face is prominent, the nose perfectly 

 flat, the head narrow and elongated, but the whole structure 

 rather thin and delicate. This cranium pertained to a woman 

 of about twenty years of age ; the facial angle gives 75 de- 

 grees ; but the internal capacity, or size of the brain, mea- 

 sures but sixty-eight cubic inches, which, Dr. Morton re- 

 marked, was as small an adult brain (with a single exception, 

 and this, also, a native African) as he had ever met with. 

 Dr. M. has shown the mean internal capacity of the Negro 

 cranium to be 85 cubic inches ;"* so that this Hottentot skull 

 presents a measurement of no less than 17 cubic inches below 

 the average.

 that it was likely to receive a large share of public patronage. 

 Mr. Browne remarked that, while such places of scientific 

 and moral instruction and amusement were quite common in 

 Europe, there was not, so far as his knowledge extended, 

 any thing of the kind in the United States; and that he 

 would feel gratified that so laudable an example should be 

 set in this city. 



Mr. Browne also remarked, that in furtherance of the plan 

 of a Zoological Garden, and in aid of its fund, there were 

 grounds to believe that several patriotic naturalists would 

 consent to deliver, at the ensuing season, lectures upon sub-

country, and that, from the length of the snout, it belonged to 

 the Gavials of Cuvier. The head, when found, was enve- 

 loped in solid limestone, which had been completely removed

Memoir on the scientific character and researches of the late 

 James Smithson, Esq. By Walter R. Johnson. Philadel- 

 phia, 1844. From the Author. 



Prof. Johnson made some remarks on the specimen of Plum- 

 bago mica presented this evening, and on the comparative 

 characteristics of other varieties of Plumbago from various 

 localities, and as an artificial product, all of which were ex- 

 hibited. 



The specimens of plumbago from Saybrook occur in felspar, as- 

 sociated with, and passing directly into dark brown mica. Indeed 

 so intimate is the union of these two minerals, that in several in- 

 stances the folia are mica on one edge, and plumbago on the other. 

 It is in some cases difficult to determine where the micaceous cha- 

 racter begins and where the plumbaginous ends. The mass has, 

 with the exception of possessing a crystalline form, much the aspect 

 of some samples of furnace cinder from anthracite iron works which 

 have fallen under Prof. J.'s notice, and which exhibited large folia- 

 ted portions of keesh or artificial plumbago, passing into a greyish 

 shining, silicious mass of nearly the same colour as the brown mica 

 which accompanies the plumbago of Saybrook. 



The only mineral with which plumbago is liable to be confounded 

 by the casual observer, is sulphuret of Molybdenum — this mineral 

 is likewise represented by authors to occur in or near Saybrook. 

 A specimen of the sulphuret of Molybdenum which Prof. Johnson 

 had tried, possessed a specific gravity of 4.6676. A specimen of 

 fibrous plumbago presented at the last meeting, (probably from Cey- 

 lon,) had a specific gravity of 2.200; a fragment of the plumbago 

 from Saybrook 2.353 ; a specimen of plumbago from Russia 2.227; 

 and a mass of plumbaginous deposite from the interior of a gas re- 

 tort, derived probably from the decomposition of bicarburetted hy- 

 drogen, had a specific gravity of 1.957. The relation between the 

 several specimens of plumbago and their contrast with the sulphuret 

 of molybdenum, are sufficiently indicative of the true nature of the 

 specimen this evening presented. The peculiar silvery colour, and 

 the greenish streak of the sulphuret were also referred to and ex- 

 hibited in contrast with the darker grey colour, and the similarly 




Jult, 1844] 75 



tinted streak of plumbago as conclusively fixing the character of 

 the specimens under consideration. 



The occurrence of plumbago in numerous localities associated 

 with coal, was alluded to, and the fact was noticed, that in these 

 cases the beds of altered or graphitized coal, are generally in close 

 proximity with igneous rocks. 



This natural conversion of coal into plumbago, with the artificial 

 production of it in the iron furnace, the gas retort and other similar 

 situations, together with its existence in primary rocks, or in the 

 fissures of adjacent sedimentary rocks, appear to point to a common 

 origin of the material in all these cases. 



Prof. J. proposed to give at a future meeting some further illus- 

 trations of the subject. 



Resolutions were adopted, accepting a proposal from Dr. 

 Morton to purchase from the Academy for a proper con- 

 sideration, the remaining half of the range of cases in the 

 South flying-gallery, for the purpose of accommodating an ad- 

 ditional portion of his collection of Crania — and also authori- 

 sing the Curators to have erected forthwith, a similar range 

 of cases for books in the North flying-gallery.

Mr. Geo. R. Gliddon read some extracts from a letter dated

 ed by Mr. Abeken (the friend and * compagnon de voyage ' 

 of Dr. Lepsius,) to Joseph Bonomi, Esq., at Cairo, and by this 

 last gentleman communicated to Mr: Gliddon at Philadel- 

 phia. 



After describing the Journey and proceedings of the Prussian 

 Scientific Mission, from their departure from Korosko (Lower Nu- 

 bia) on the 8th January, to the return to Khartoon of Dr. Lepsius 

 and himself, from their excursion into the province of Sennaar along 

 the Blue Nile, as far as the 13th degree of North Latitude, Mr. 

 Abeken says, in regard to the Monuments and Pyramids on the 

 Island of Meroe : 



" Thus the fabulous antiquity of Meroe has dwindled away ! I 

 dare affirm, that, on the whole Island or Peninsula of Meroe, there 

 is not one vestige of remote antiquity ; and, for my own part, I have 

 no doubt, that ./Ethiopia received its religion, literature and civiliza- 

 tion entirely from Egypt ; and that even at a comparatively late 

 time. We are anxious to see the works of Tirkaka (3d King of 

 the Ethiopian, or Cush-ite Dynasty — the XXV. Dynasty of Mane- 

 tho — B. C. 695 — see RosellinVs chronology in Gliddon , s Ancient

 make out a connecting link between him and the later ./Ethiopians 

 of Meroe.''

78 [August, 1844. 



Dr. Zantzinger called the attention of the Society to the specimen 

 of milky fluid or juice derived from the Cow tree of S. America, 

 which had been presented at the last stated meeting by a lady of this 

 city. As this was a substance of peculiar interest, and the opportunity 

 of obtaining or of seeing it here very rarely occurred, he stated that he 

 had, on these accounts, been induced to collect from various sources 

 some information relating to it, which he would now present to the 

 Society. Most of the facts had been obtained from Curtis' Botanical 

 Magazine, Vol. 13, new series. 



The tree affording this milk is a native of Venezuela, and was 

 first discovered by Humboldt in the year 1802, and was believed 

 by him to be peculiar to the Corderilla of the shore, between a plan- 

 tation called Barbula and the Lake of Maracay bo, a district of country 

 extending from the 65th to the 71st degree W. Longitude, and from 

 the 9th to the 11th degree N. Latitude. It grows in situations elevated 

 probably from 3000 to 4000 feet above the level of the sea, and in 

 a temperature of which the annual mean is from 65° to 70°. It is 

 called by the natives Palo de Vaca, and is highly prized by them. 



The true botanical character of this plant is not yet accurately 

 determined. Its flowers having never been seen by botanists, 

 the class and order to which it belongs cannot therefore be ascer- 

 tained. The fruit is known, and has been figured and described. 

 By some it has been considered as a species of Brosimum, by others 

 as belonging to the natural family Sapotese ; but it is now generally 

 regarded as a new genus, to which the name Galactodendron, ori- 

 ginally suggested by Humboldt, has been applied. Its generic cha- 

 racters are given by Kunth, in his ' Synopsis Plant: iEquinoc:' 

 He places it among the Urticece, and has called it Galactodendron 

 utile. The fruit is a monosperm, contained in a green covering or 

 rind, and as represented in Curtis' Botanical Magazine, is not unlike 

 in size and shape the fruit of the Hickory or Walnut. 



Humboldt's description of this tree is to be found in his c Relation 

 Historique,' Vol. 2. He states that, while on his route, for some 

 weeks he had heard much of a tree called the Cow tree, whose 

 juice is a nourishing milk, and that the natives regarding it as such, 

 consumed large quantities of it. This was to him an extraordinary 

 fact, as almost all lactescent vegetable fluids are unpalatable, and 

 more or less poisonous. 



He found, however, that the statements he had received were not

exaggerated, as he had subsequently ample opportunities of judging 

 from trials made of it himself. He says: "It was a gluey and 

 thickish milk, destitute of acridity and exhaling a very agreeable 

 balsamic odour. It was offered to us in calabashes, and though 

 we drank large quantities of it, both at night before going to bed, 

 and again early in the morning, we experienced no uncomfortable 

 effects." The viscidity of this milk was the chie'f objection to it. The 

 natives and slaves used it freely, and became visibly fatter during 

 the season when the Palo de Vaca yields most milk. 



Other naturalists and travellers have since confirmed these state- 

 ments of Humboldt. He also says : " none of the wonders of these tro- 

 pical regions so rivetted my gaze as did this tree, growing on the sides 

 of rocks, its thick roots scarcely penetrating the stony soil, and un- 

 moistened for many months in the year by a drop of dew' or rain. 

 But dry and dead as the branches appear, if you pierce the trunk, a 

 sweet and nutritive milk flows forth, which is in greatest profusion at 

 day-break. At this time the blacks and other natives of the vicinity 

 hasten from all quarters, furnished with large vessels to catch the 

 milk, winch thickens and turns yellow on the surface. Some drink 

 it on the spot, others carry it home to their children, and you might 

 fancy you saw the family of a cow-herd gathering around him and 

 receiving from him the produce of his kine."* 



Sir Robert Ker Porter, British consul at Laguayra, at the request 



Sir Wm. Hooker, visited in the month of May, 1837, the region 

 where the Palo de Vaca is found. Accompanied by some of th© na- 

 tives, with great difficulty and fatigue, and through a dense and un- 

 travelled forest, and at an elevation which he supposed to be 4000 

 feet above the level of the sea, he reached a group of these trees, 

 and at once made an incision into one of them, ' from which flowed 

 the milk, white and limpid as that of the cow, sweet to the palate 

 and accompanied by an aromatic smell, but leaving a clamminess 

 upon the lips, and upon the tongue a slight bitter.' He was enabled 

 in a short time to obtain a considerable quantity, although less than 

 was usual, as his visit was made during the decrease of the moon, 

 when this fluid is said not to be so abundant as during its increase. 



The trunks of the trees seen by him measured in some instances 

 20 feet in circumference, and had attained an altitude of at least aft

80 [August, 1844. 



hundred feet. The trunk frequently rose sixty feet before it 

 branched ; the branches spread on each side 25 or 30 feet, and from 

 30 to 40 feet higher. They were densely clothed with foliage of a 

 rich and velvety green colour. The leaves measured from 10 to 

 16 inches in length, and 2 to 4 inches in breadth. The wood was 

 white, hard and very close grained, and the bark of the larger 

 branches was of a yellowish colour.* 



An analysis of the milk of the Palo de Vaca, was made in the 

 year 1823 by MM. Rivero and Boussingault, and published in the 

 23d vol. of the Annales de Chimie, of which the following is a sum- 

 mary : 



This vegetable milk possesses the same physical properties as 

 that of the cow, except in being rather viscid ; but in chemical pro- 

 perties it materially differs. 



It mixes readily with water in all proportions, is not curdled by 

 acids, and is rendered more liquid by ammonia, which latter cha- 

 racter shows the absence of caoutchouc — alcohol slightly coagulates 

 it. When fresh it slightly reddens turnsol. At the temperature of 

 100° Cent, it boils. When slightly coagulated by the alcohol, the 

 more liquid portion may be passed through a filter. This when 

 evaporated to the consistence of a syrup and treated with rectified 

 alcohol, developes a little sugar, but the greater part is insoluble. 

 The insoluble portion has a bitter taste, and by chemical manipu- 

 lation may be made to yield a salt of a magnesian character. 



Under the action of heat, the milk of the Palo de Vaca presents 

 at first the same phenomena as that of the cow. A pellicle is quick- 

 ly formed on the surface, which prevents the disengagement of 

 aqueous vapour. Upon the pellicle being raised as fast as formed, 

 and the evaporation continued carefully at a moderate heat, oily 

 drops begin to form ; these increase in proportion as the water is 

 driven off, and at length unite into an oily liquid, in which floats a 

 fibrous substance which shrivels up according as the temperature of 

 the oil increases. By proper measures the oily matter may be con- 

 verted into a substance of a yellowish white colour, solid, translucent, 

 resisting pressure, insoluble in water, soluble in hot alcohol and in 

 the essential oils, &c, and in fact resembling refined bees-wax, and 

 applicable to the same purposes. 



* Curtis' Botan. Mag., Vol. 13, new series. 




August, 1844.] SI 



The fibrous substance is of a brown colour, and without taste; 

 upon a hot iron it swells, then becomes shrivelled and carbonised, 

 giving out an odour like that of broiled meat. Other experiments 

 with this fibrous matter showed its close similarity to animal fibre. 



The constituents of the milk of the Cow tree, as ascertained by 

 MM. Rivero and Boussingault are therefore, 1st. wax: 2d. fibrine : 

 3d. a little sugar: 4th. a magnesian salt: and 5th. water. 



Another analysis has been made by the celebrated Mr. Thomson, 

 and published in his Vegetable Chemistry. He regards the substance 

 called fibrous by Rivero and Boussingault as having many cha- 

 racters similar to those of cork. He also discovered in it a new 

 substance which he called Galacline, obtained by evaporating the 

 milk to dryness by a gentle heat, and digesting the residue in hot 

 alcohol. Upon the solution cooling, an abundance of snow white 

 flakes are deposited, which constitutes the Galactine, of which he 

 gives the ultimate analysis. 



The specimen on the table is a portion of some brought by the 

 Brig Caraccas, Capt. Dill, which sailed from Porto Cabello on the 

 2d July last. It was furnished at the request of a gentleman of 

 this city, by a resident of Porto Cabello. The bottle in which it 

 was sent, contained about a pint, and was labelled ' Leche Palo de 

 Vaca ;' and the letter accompanying it, gave some particulars re- 

 specting the mode in which it was obtained. 



The long period which has elapsed since it was taken from the 

 tree, has necessarily occasioned an a4teration in some of its sen- 

 sible properties. 



In colour and consistence it can scarcely be distinguished from 

 ordinary milk ; but the smell resembles that of sour or stale cheese, 

 and the taste is of course not agreeable. If allowed to remain un- 

 disturbed for some time, it separates spontaneously into two portions ; 

 an upper and by far the largest portion, which is thick and viscid, 

 and a thinner one below which is transparent, of a greenish yellow 

 colour, and very like the whey of ordinary milk. When exposed 

 to the air, it quickly thickens and becomes of a dark colour. 



Dr. Z. stated that he hoped to have an opportunity to exhibit at 

 a future period, specimens of the fruit, leaves, and probably the 

 flowers of this interesting plant ; as he had been kindly promised 

 by the gentleman alluded to above, that every effort should be made 

 to obtain them for the Academy.

Skull very broad posteriorly, whence it tapers in a gradual and 

 triangular manner to a narrow, elongated snout. Orbits very large, 

 oblique, and with but slight marginal elevation. Temporal fossa? of 

 great size, and the spiracles? placed immediately below and before 

 the inner margin of the orbit. Length of the head from the su- 

 perior margin of the occiput to the broken end of the snout 23 

 inches : width of the occiput behind, 12| inches ; lateral diameter of 

 orbit 3£ inches ; lateral diameter of temporal fossa) 4g inches. Re- 

 maining teeth 13 on each side. Lateral diameter of terminal end of 

 the snout 3) inches. 




August, 1844.] 



S3 



This species is wholly unlike any other, fossil or recent, with 

 which I have been able to compare it. It seems to form an inter- 

 mediate link between the Gavials and true Crocodiles, for the snout, 

 though long and narrow, is gradually and not abruptly produced 

 from the head, and has probably been from eight to twelve inches 

 longer than it now is. 



This remarkably large and admirably preserved relic, was found 

 in the cretaceous limestone which overlies the ferruginous marl near 

 Vincentown, in New Jersey, and has been obligingly presented to 

 our Institution by General William Irick (on whose farm it was 

 discovered,) and William Whitman, Esq. of this city. These strata 

 of cretaceous limestone were first discovered and announced by me 

 in 1829; in which year I published an account of them, with a list 

 of their organic remains, as observed at Timber creek, in Gloucester 

 county.* Since that period I have continued my researches into 

 this interesting section of our geology, which I have subsequently 

 identified in two other localities in New Jersey, viz. Vincentown and 

 the vicinity of Salem, and also in South Carolina west of Charleston ; 

 at which latter place the fossils have been chiefly collected by Dr. 

 Ravenel, who is preparing for publication a description of several 

 species hitherto unknown. 



I obtained from Timber creek at my first visit, a fragment of the 

 jaw of a Crocodile with three teeth ; but the parts were not suf- 

 ficiently perfect to enable me to decide to which division of this class 

 of animals it pertained. Upon comparing it, however, with the spe-

S4 [August, 1844. 



cimen now under consideration, it appears to belong to a Gavial, 

 and in all probability to the G. clavirostris. 



Dr. Harlan, many years ago, described the remains of a fossil 

 crocodile from the lower or ferruginous beds of this series.* These 

 fragments enabled Dr. Harlan to reconstruct the head so far as to 

 identify it as a true crocodile, to which he gave the name of C. 

 macrorhyncus.\ This species is figured in the fourth volume of the 

 Journal of the Academy, and the fossil itself is preserved in the So- 

 ciety's collections. 



During Mr. Lyell's recent visit to this country, he also obtained 

 some fragments of a fossil crocodile which appear to belong to the 

 Procajlian division of this family.:]: 



Prof. Buckland remarks that " as there were scarcely any mam- 

 malia during the secondary periods, whilst the waters were abun- 

 dantly stored with fishes, we might, a priori, expect that if any 

 crocodilean forms had then existed, they would most nearly have 

 resembled the modern Gavial. And we have hitherto found only 

 those genera which have elongated beaks in formations anterior to, 

 and including the chalk; whilst true crocodiles, with a short and 

 broad snout, like that of the cayman and alligator, appear for the 

 first time in strata of the tertiary periods, in which the remains of 

 mammalia abound. §" 



This remark would seem to conflict, in a geological sense, with 

 the observations of Dr. Harlan, as jnst quoted, because his descrip- 

 tion and figure correspond to those of a true crocodile; while the 

 C. clavirostris seems, as we have remarked, to possess an interme- 

 diate organic structure. 



M. Geoffrey St. Hiliare has divided the fossil Gavials into two 

 genera, viz : Teleosaurus and Steneosaurns, which chiefly differ from 

 each other in the position and form of the anterior termination of 

 the nasal canal. As the terminal portion of the snout of the present 

 specimen has not been discovered, we cannot avail ourselves of this 

 generic distinction ; and this uncertainty must continue until the re- 

 covery of the deficient portion may enable us to decide the question.

 paper by the latter, containing additional descriptions of N. 

 American Coleoptera; which, on motion, was referred to the 

 committee appointed on his former paper, read August 6th 

 last. 



Professor Johnson then offered some remarks on the speci- 

 mens of rocks presented by him this evening. 



Those from the summit of Mount Washington are quartz, coarse 

 granite, and tourmaline, with quartz filling its fissures, and plates 

 of mica adhering to its crystals. Those from the northwestern 

 slope of the same mountain are hornblende, and tabular masses of a 

 micaceous rock, in which the folia are laid in narrow bands ob- 

 liquely inclined to each other. All these materials are very durable 

 in their nature, and suffer little from mere atmospheric influence. 

 In strong contrast with these are many of the rocks found at the 

 White mountain notch. The latter are generally more or less 

 friable in their nature, and liable to pretty rapid detrition. They 

 consist of beds of gneis, intermixed with others of a granitoid cha- 

 racter, having the aspect and constituents of granite, but the loose- 

 ness and friability of gneis which has been long exposed to the 

 weather. The hardest specimens obtained from thst part of the 

 notch which contains the celebrated Willey house, are mixtures of 

 quartz and serpentine. 



A portion of the masses having a granitic aspect has since the 

 catastrophe which happened to the Willey family about 18 years 

 ago, become completely disintegrated, and fallen into small gra- 

 nules. 



The event just alluded to seems to furnish, to a considerable ex- 




90 [September, 1S44. 



tent at least, a solution of the present aspect, if not of the very 

 existence of this notch. The numerous and extensive scars which 

 the mountain still bears, derived from that occurrence, with others 

 obviously produced by similar means, but of a more ancient date, 

 and not in the notch only, but also in the numerous recesses all 

 along this mountain chain, point significantly to the causes which, 

 through innumerable ages, have been operating upon the gradual 

 degradation of the softer portions of these elevated regions. The 

 notch is stated to be, at its highest part, about 2000 feet above the 

 level of tide water. For the first few miles the descent is very 

 rapid, and the head of the Saco is truly a mountain torrent. This 

 steep acclivity favors the rapid action of water in washing down 

 the looser portions of the rock formation — aided as it is by the al- 

 ternate wetting and drying of the rocks. 



The Chairman announced to the Society the decease, on 

 the 5th September last, of Miss Anna Maclure, at the resi- 

 dence of her brother Alexander Maclure, Esq., at New Har- 

 mony, Indiana. The zeal with which this lady, in common 

 with her brother, has ever promoted the objects and interests 

 of this Institution, will indissolubly connect her name with 

 its past and future history, as one of its earnest friends and 

 liberal benefactors.

Philadelphia, Sept. 22d, 1S44. 

 Dear Sir, — I send you an extract of a letter which I have 

 lately received, which is only one of many in my possession, 

 going to prove that rain may be produced by man in time of 

 drought. 



"Dear Sir, — The undersigned citizens of Coudersport, Pa., 

 and vicinity, desirous of rendering you what little aid they possi- 

 bly can, beg leave to present to you their testimonial of the fol- 

 lowing facts. 



On Saturday the 13th of July, about one o'clock, the fallow of 

 D. F. Ellsworth, Esq., containing about six acres was fired. At 

 the time the fire was set, the day was calm and warm, and would 

 be considered clear ; there were some flying clouds, with slight 

 appearance of rain to the North, but none in our neigborhood. 

 The fire spread rapidly and burned with great violence. 




92 [October, 1844. 



In a short time, a white cloud was seen to form over the black 

 smoke, which rose over the fire with great rapidity, nearly per- 

 pendicular. The white cloud rolled outwards above, especially 

 towards the North and South, and probably towards the East as 

 the wind was gentle in that direction, and as the rain which fell 

 from it increased as it proceeded East, as far as heard from. It 

 did not swell out far towards the West. In less than an hour 

 from the commencement of the burning, very large drops of rain 

 were seen descending by many inhabitants of Coudersport from 

 the cloud, glittering in the rays of the sun like diamonds. 



It rained but little in Coudersport, which is about one hundred 

 rods west of the fire, and none at all one half mile west of the 

 village. 



This latter fact was remarked particularly by Charles Lyman, 

 who was ten miles west of Coudersport, at the time of the burn- 

 ing, and who found the road very dusty until he came within a 

 few rods of the village, when the first edge of the shower made 

 its appearance. Mr. Lyman lives two miles east of Coudersport, 

 and he found the quantity of rain which had fallen constantly in- 

 creased as he advanced. When he got home he found the ground 

 quite wet; previous to the rain it was quite dry and parched, 

 suffering much for want of rain. 



Samuel Taggart lives six miles east of the fire, and at his 

 place the shower was very violent, and lasted about thirty minu- 

 tes. Some of our citizens watched the whole formation of the 

 cloud and its gradual recession towards the East after the rain, 

 and we have understood from credible authority that it rained 

 hard and much longer many miles to the East the same after- 

 noon. 



We are unanimously of the opinion that the rain was produced 

 by the burning of the fallow, and we think it due to your zeal in 

 the cause of science to make this communication to you. 

 Yours, 



John S. Mann, Att. at Law.

W. C. Butterworth, Att. at Law.

Description of some new species of Fossil Organic Remains, from 

 the Eocene of South Carolina. By Edmund Ravenel, M. D., 

 of Charleston, S. C.* 



Genus PECTEN. 



1. Pecten Mortoni. Specific character — Orbicular, thin, both 

 valves moderately convex, one more so than the other — outside, 

 with numerous concentric obsolete strice; inside, — with from eighteen 

 to twenty four radiating double ribs, slightly elevated ; ears large, 

 sub-equal, striated externally. 



This species is nearly allied to the P. pleuronectus and P. japo- 

 nicus. It is found in the limestone on my plantation, The Grove, 

 in St. Thomas's Parish, about 17 miles from Charleston, and also on 

 Goose creek, at Mr. Henry Smith's, about 7 miles South West from 

 the Grove deposit, and 1 1 miles from Charleston; Cooper River being 

 between these localities. 



This shell is abundant at the Grove, but being large and thin, it 

 is generally broken in getting out the marl, and with the exception 

 of a few small specimens, I have not been able to procure a perfect 

 valve. 



The largest specimen in my possession although not perfect, is 

 sufficiently so to determine its size; it is 8| inches in diameter. 



I take much pleasure in designating this shell by the name of our 

 distinguished Geologist, Dr. Samuel George Morton, of Philadelphia. 



2. Pecten Holbrookii. Specific character — Orbicular, convex 

 with twenty-three large, prominent, somewhat flattened ribs, smooth, 

 margin strongly dentate ; ears large, nearly equal, obscurely rib- 

 bed, within deeply channeled on the hinge margin ; cavity of the 

 ligament triangular, deep. Transveise diameter 5s inches, longi- 

 tudinal diameter 4f inches. 



Detached valves only have fallen into my hands. It occurs in my 



* It is designed to give wood-cuts of these interesting species in a fu- 

 ture number.

own marl pits, at the Grove, with the P. Mortoni, but more rarely. 

 I have fragments of larger specimens than the one described ; from 

 these fragments it is probable that both valves are convex, one a 

 little more so than the other. 



I have dedicated this species to our learned herpetologist, Profes- 

 sor Holbrook, of Charleston, S. C. 



Genus TEREBRATULA. 



Terebratula canipes. Specific character. Larger valve, pear- 

 shaped, convex ; beak rather large and prominent ; seven plaits ex- 

 tending from the anterior, and part of the lateral margin to about 

 two-thirds of the shell towards the beak, three of these occupying 

 the middle, and two others, less prominent, each of the sides: mar- 

 gin deeply toothed by the plaits. Length 1| inches, width 1 3-8 

 inches. 



I found a single valve in the limestone thrown out for agricul- 

 tural purposes at the Plantation of Dr. J. G. Prioleau, in St. John's 

 Parish, S. C, about five miles south of Black Oak, on the Santee 

 Canal. It was associated with fragments and casts of various 

 species which could not be determined with certainty, with the ex- 

 ception of "Pecten calvatus," (Morton,) "Ostrea panda," (Morton,) 

 and " Scutella Lyelli," Pileus sinensis, (nobis.) 



The marl on this property is conveniently obtained from the 

 bottom of a small creek, which is often nearly dry, and as it varies 

 in hardness, the deposit has been examined at different spots within 

 a half mile. At one of these places, about 200 yards from that at 

 which I found this Terebratula, the Scutella pileus-sinensis is cu- 

 riously abundant and perfect, and is almost the only fossil which 

 can be determined. In a few cart loads thrown out, and not used 

 from being too hard, thousands of this fossil are visible. 



Unfortunately, the rock is generally too hard to permit their re- 

 moval ; occasionally a good specimen may be procured, but gene- 

 rally they are broken in the effort to separate them. 



Genus SCUTELLA. 

 Scutella pileus-sinensis. — (Mandarin's hat.) Specific character: 

 Orbicular; posterior margin slightly truncated, with two slight in- 

 dentations opposite the posterior ambulacra; margin thin, least so 

 anteriorly. 




98 [October, 1844. 



Apex a little anterior to the centre and very much elevated and 

 rounded ; ambulacra rather short. 



Beneath slightly concave, with five compressed lines correspond- 

 ing with the ambulacra, dividing at about half their length into two, 

 and then running on, becoming less distinct, to the margin. Dia- 

 meter three inches. 



This fossil is found abundantly in a mass of limestone on the 

 estate of Dr. Philip G. Prioleau, in St. John's Parish, S. Carolina, 

 about six miles south of Black Oak Lock of Santee Canal. 



The limestone is excavated for agricultural purposes, and in 

 spreading it upon the fields, numerous very perfect specimens are 

 thrown out. 



The elevation of the apex is very remarkable, and at once dis- 

 tinguishes this species from any other with which' I am ac- 

 quainted. 



( To be continued.) 



The Committee on Dr. Melsheimer's papers, read August 

 6th, and September 26th, 1841, describing new species of N.

 cles, which have a bluish reflection," is absent in the present species, it may 

 nevertheless be peregrinus.

 obtusely rounded : feet and beneath castaneous or piceous. — Differs from 

 fasciatus, Oliv. A-signatus, Say, sanguinolentus, Oliv., and bipustulatu ,

Trogosita castanea, Melsh Catal. 



Closely allied if not the same, to cinnamonea, Say, but it differs from that 

 species in being differently colored, in having the head and thorax more dis- 

 tinctly punctured, in^the elytra being always comparatively wider and deci- 

 dedly differently engraved ; in the present species the striae and punctures 

 are obsolete and the surface much wrinkled. Say, in a letter, considers cas- 

 tanea identical with his cinnamonea.

Body subelliptic, black : head with large, deep and vicinal punctures ; a 

 punctiform impression between the eyes : mandibles black : antennae piceous : 

 thorax subquadrate, obviously widest at base, with the sides feebly arcuated ; 

 surface punctured like the head, with a narrow impunctured dorsal space ; 

 posterior angles minute, acute, excurved : elytra with the sides almost paral- 

 lel from the humeral angle to near the tip ; deeply punctate-striate, the in- 

 terstices each form two series of minute oblong distant punctures: beneath 

 and feet piceous. This species can hardly be either T. depressior or subni- 

 gra of Pal. de Beauv., if his figures and descriptions of these two species be 

 correct.

 the interstices flat and transversely finely wrinkled : venter and postpectus 




110 [October, 1S44. 



dark reddish-brown-piceous : antepectus, feet, epipleurae and ventral margins 

 rufo-piceous. This species is closely allied to the preceding, from which 

 it differs, apart from the color, in no essential character, except in the fine 

 somewhat obsoletely punctured striae of the elytra, and the perfectly flat, and 

 wrinkled interstices of the same. It must be also closely allied to marginata, 

 Beauv., and may probably prove to be that species. 



4. T. dubia. Blackish, with the sides of the elytra piceous, or testaceous ;

 very narrow, obscure ; a small indentation on the anterior angles : scutel im- 

 punctured, pitchy-black : elytra blackish, tinged with reddish-piceous, 

 slightly widest behind the middle, with the lateral margin obsoletely dull 

 reddish-brown or piceous ; punctate-striate, the interstices with minute, 

 distinct oblong punctures ; beneath piceous : feet rufo-piceous.

Oblong-subovate : head blackish, finely and somewhat densely punctured : 

 antennas testaceous : thorax strongly transverse, narrowed at base with the

 impressed : beneath and feet colored as the elytra. 



Only a single specimen of this species has yet occurred to us, which was 

 perhaps in an immature state when captured.

The Committee to whom was referred a communication 

 from Dr Morton, containing observations on Ancient Egyp- 

 tian Crania, reported in favor of publication. 



Observations on a second series of Ancient Egyptian Crania. 

 Towards the close of the year 1842, Dr. Lepsius, the distin- 

 guished head of the Prussian Scientific Commission in Egypt, re- 

 opened several very ancient tombs in the vicinity of the Pyramids 

 of Ghezeh. These tombs date with the third and fourth dynasties 

 of Egyptian chronology, as is proved by their inscriptions ; but 

 having been the receptacles of wealthy individuals, they were no 

 ,doubt plundered in very remote times; and whenever succeeding 

 generations have again devoted them to sepulchral purposes, avarice 

 has renewed its desecrations in the search for treasure. Thus, the 

 Hykshos, Persians, Greeks, Romans and Saracens, have probably 

 each in turn violated these tombs; leaving it a question of entire 

 uncertainty, whether the embalmed bodies'now found in them belong 

 to the earlier or later epochs of Egyptian history. I make these 

 remarks to show that I do not infer the age of these mummies from 

 the date of the tombs ; but at the same time it may be observed, 




October, 1844.] 123 



that in the mere search for plunder there was no occasion to de- 

 stroy or eject the bodies of the dead ; and mutilated as they are, it 

 is possible that some of them may have pertained to a very remote 

 age. 



My friend Dr. Pickering, writing to me from Cairo about the 

 time of these explorations, observes that Dr. Lepsius expected to 

 find " the veritable remains of the primeval Egyptians ; but it was 

 discovered that they had been displaced by Greeks, &c, and that 

 there was nothing of this sort older than Psammeticus." (B.C. 550.) 

 The bodies that retained their legends may have been of Greek 

 and other comparatively modern inhabitants of Egypt; but with re- 

 spect to the seventeen skulls before us, I have no hesitation in declar- 

 ing, that but two of them could have belonged to persons of Greek 

 or any other Indo-European lineage. The others may have borne 

 Greek inscriptions, but that would not make them Greeks ; for the 

 language of the latter people was the compulsory vernacular tongue 

 during most of the Ptolemaic epoch. Moreover, the skulls in 

 question are entirely denuded of bandages and even of integuments ; 

 whence it seems evident that no inferences drawn from Greek or 

 other inscriptions could have applied to them. 



The following is an Ethnographic analysis of this series of 

 crania : 



Egyptian form, - - - - - 11 



Egyptian form, with traces of Negro lineage, 2 



Negroid form, - 1 



Pelasgic form, - - - - - - 2 



Semitic form, 1 



17 



Remarks. 



1. The Egyptian form is admirably characterized in eleven of 

 these heads, and corresponds in every particular with the Nilotic 

 physiognomy, as indicated by monumental and sepulchral evidences 

 in my Crania iEgy ptiaca, viz. — the small, long and narrow head, with 

 a somewhat receding forehead, narrow and rather projecting face, 

 and delicacy of the whole osteological structure. No hair remains, 




124 [October,, 1S44. 



and the bony meatus of the ear corresponds with that of all other 

 Caucasian nations. 



Two other heads present some mixture of Negro lineage with the 

 Egyptian, which is expressed in the conformation and expression 

 of the facial bones, more particularly as seen in the greater breadth 

 and flatness of the face, and a stronger development of the upper 

 maxilla. 



Of these thirteen crania, eleven are adult, of which the largest 

 has an internal capacity of 93 cubic inches, and the smallest 76, 

 giving a mean of 86 cubic inches for the size of the brain. This 

 measurement exceeds, by only three cubic inches, the average de- 

 rived from the entire series of Egyptian heads in my Crania 

 iEgyptiaca. 



The facial angle of the adult heads gives a mean of 82°, the 

 largest rising as high as 86°, and the smallest being 78°. Two 

 other heads are those of children, in whom the Egyptian conforma- 

 tion is perfect, and these give, respectively, the remarkably large 

 facial angle of 89° and 91°. The mean adult angle is greater than 

 that given by the large series measured in the Crania iEgyptiaca. 

 Is this owing to the fact, that the heads now under consideration 

 belonged to persons of distinction, and probably, therefore, of edu- 

 cation and refinement ? 



These crania, as already observed, are long and narrow, and 

 receding in front ; but posteriorly, in the parietal regions they be- 

 come much broader ; the whole occiput is very full, and remarkably 

 projecting ; the sides of the cranium are rather flat, and the coronal 

 region long and depressed. 



2. The Negroid head, as I have elsewhere explained, is a mix- 

 ture of the Caucasian and Negro form in which the latter predomi- 

 nates. Such is the case in the present instance, as even a partially 

 practised eye can readily discover. This head strongly resem- 

 bles those of two modern Copts in my possession. It gives 81 cubic 

 inches for the size of the brain, and a facial angle of 80. It is re- 

 markable for deep depressions on the lateral surfaces of the parietal 

 bones, apparently caused by the action of the posterior portions of 

 a powerful occipito-frontalis muscle. Among six hundred skulls in 

 my collection, but two present this development in an equal degree ; 

 one of these is an Egyptian, the other a Hindoo head. 




October, 1S44.] 



125 



3. Of the two Pelasgic heads, one is perfect, and well character- 

 ised in most of its proportions. It has an internal capacity of 93 

 cubic inches, and a facial angle of 80°. The other head has lost 

 the bones of the face, whence its ethnographic relations are not so 

 obvious; and I have ventured to judge it by its cranial developments. 

 It is internally but two cubic inches smaller than the other. 



4. The solitary Semitic head, has rather the common Arab, than 

 the Hebrew cast of features. It measures internally 87 cubic 

 inches, and has a facial angle of 79°. 



The ages of the individuals 'to whom these seventeen skulls 

 pertained, may be proximately stated as follows: 5, 7,* 18, 20, 20, 

 25, 30, 40, 40, 40, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 55. 



The resuhs derived from this series of crania, sustain in a most 

 gratifying manner, those obtained from the greater collection of 

 one hundred skulls sent me from Egypt, by my friend, George R. 

 Gliddon, Esq., and which have afforded the materials of my Crania 

 Egyptiaca ; and without making further comparisons on the present 

 occasion, (for I design from time to time to resume the subject, as 

 facts and materials may come to my hands,)! shall merely subjoin 

 my Ethnographic table from the Crania ./Egyptiaca, so extended as 

 to embrace all the ancient Egyptian skulls now in my possession. 

 ■Ethnographic Table of one hundred and seventeen ancient Egyptian Crania. 



It remains for me to add, which I do with great pleasure, that I 

 am indebted for this second series of Egyptian Crania, to Mr. Wm. 

 A. Gliddon, of Cairo, who, prompted by that extraordinary interest 

 in Egyptian questions which seems inherent in his family, has 

 availed himself of every opportunity for extending our knowledge 

 of the people and the monuments of ancient Egypt. 



* The two juvenile heads are of course not used in calculating the mean 

 either of the size of the brain or the facial angle. 




126 [October, 1844. 



A letter from Dr. Richard Lepsius, head of the Prussian 

 Scientific Commission in Egypt, was read at the meeting of 

 the 23d of July last, but accidentally omitted in the last number 

 of the Proceedings. It is addressed to Mr. Gliddon,and dated at 

 Khartoon, (junction of the White and Blue Nile,) March 29, 

 1844. After returning thanks for his election as a Corres- 

 ponding member of this Society, he concludes his letter with 

 the following highly interesting announcement : 



" The most important result of my visit to the Pyramids 

 of Begerawe, and the temples at Ben Naga, Naga and the 

 Wadee e'-Sofra, is, that all these monuments ascend, as an 

 extreme, as far as the times of the Ptolemies ; and date, for 

 the most part, about the first centuries of our era. I hasten 

 to examine the Ethiopian monuments of Mount. Berkal, 

 which date at least as far back as the seventh century before 

 Christ.' ,

The Chairman announced to the Society the recent de- 

 cease, in Switzerland, of our late fellow member Nathan 

 Dunn, Esq., and stated, that in his will, a copy of which was 

 on the table, it would be found that a bequest of $ 10,000 

 had been made to this Institution. The Chairman, however, 




November, 1S44.] 131 



remarked, that in consequence of a great depreciation in the 

 value of the testator's property having taken place since this 

 will was made, the Academy could scarcely entertain a hope 

 that this munificent legacy would come into its possession. 



Mr. G. Vale, of New York, exhibited a model of an im- 

 proved globe and celestial sphere of his invention, and entered 

 into a detailed explanation of its construction and mode of 

 using it. 



The instrument was admirably calculated to show the 

 manner in which all the problems on both Terrestrial and 

 Celestial Globes may be performed in a simple manner con- 

 formable to the real motions of the earth and heavenly 

 bodies.

Dr. Morton exhibited an interesting and numerous collec- 

 tion of fossil bones of the Mosasaurus, from New Jersey, con- 

 sisting of 38 nearly perfect vertebrae, a perfect tooth, several 

 fragments of other bones, and perhaps the most remarkable 

 of all, a perfect coprolite, or portion of fossil excrement of 

 this animal. 



These had all been recently obtained from the ferruginous 

 sand near Mount Holly, New Jersey, and were presented to 

 Dr. Morton by Mr. Wm. L. Bispham of this city. 



Dr. Morton then proceeded to make some brief observa- 

 tions on the general characters of the European Mosasaurus, 




November, 1814.] 133 



and pointed out some differences which a comparison of the 

 specimens on the table with the descriptions of that species 

 would seem to indicate. 



These differences he believed to be sufficient to authorise 

 a new specific name, and he therefore proposed that of 

 M. occidentalis. 



In the absence, however, of more positive information on 

 this subject than he at present possessed, lie stated that he 

 preferred that this specific designation should be considered 

 as merely provisional.

1. O. castaneus. Testaceous ; head armed with two long erect horns. — 3| 1. 

 long. Pennsylvania. 



Light chestnut, clothed with very short ochraceous hairs : head with the front 

 profoundly and distantly punctured, with two long erect horns between the 

 eyes, and with the clypeus almost impunctured, reflexed and slightly repand at 

 tip; glossy : antennas pale, ochraceous : thorax densely and profoundly punc- 

 tured, moderately excavated each side before, and lobate in the middle; obtusely 

 grooved behind the middle : elytra each with six fine striae, interstices finely 

 punctured : pygidium with large, profound and vicinal punctures: beneath and 

 feet rufo-piceous, with the anterior pair of tibia dusky. The $ differs from 

 the $ in having the thorax dark green, the head, as in common, with two 

 transverse ridges in place of the horns, and the clypeus densely transversely 

 wrinkled- 



2. 0. niger. Black ; thorax with a greenish reflection. — 2| 1. long. Penn- 

 sylvania. 



Black : head profoundly and distantly punctured, with two small tubercles 

 between the eyes ; clypeus piceous, entire, rounded and reflexed at tip, and with 

 a short, transverse, elevated line each side at base : thorax numerously and pro- 

 foundly punctured, slightly excavated each side before, and slightly lobate in the 

 middle, with the lobe feebly concave in the middle 4 dorsal groove obsolete be- 

 hind the middle ; black, with a greenish reflection : elytra finely striate, with the 

 interstices finely punctured : pygidium punctured as in the preceding species: 

 venter black, opake : pectus pitchy-black: feet pitchy chestnut.

 the tip and flattened and dilated at base ; profoundly and distantly punctured, 

 each puncture furnishing one or two rufous hairs; clypeus with the margin re- 

 flexed, and faintly emarginate at apex : thorax much punctured, and clothed 

 with short rufous hairs ; a fine glabrous dorsa! line ; anterior edge slightly re- 

 tuso : elytra fulvous, confluently maculate with black, finely striate, interstices 

 with irregular series of minute and distant punctures ; hirsute like the thorax : 

 pygidium punctured as in castaneus : beneath and feet black, glossy': pectus and 

 under part of the head with long rufous hairs. The 9 differs from the $ in 

 bein^ destitute of the occipital horn, instead of which the head is armed with 

 two prominent transverse ridges, of which the anterior one is arcuated : the cly- 

 peus is also very rough with punctures. Distinct from the 0. nuchicornis, 

 Fabr. 



4. O. protensus. Green ; thorax anteriorly produced in a flat biped projec- 

 tion ; elytra at base and apex testaceous. — 4 1. long. Pennsylvania. Rare.^

 lobe, projecting over the head ; dorsum obsoletely channelled behind ; punctured, 

 and clothed with short rufous hairs; green : elytra faintly striate, the interstices 

 minutely punctured; green, with the base and apex irregularly testaceous: py- 

 gidium punctured, superior half rufo-testaceous : beneath and feet green. Of 

 this species there is only a single specimen in our collection. 



0. latebrosus, Fabr.— hecate, Panz. The % of this species varies much in 

 the length of the thoracic central lobe, being in some specimens only half the 

 common length, and in others it is still less, being represented only by two small 

 tubercles. Fabricius described a $ , and Panzer figured and described a $ ; 

 the name of the latter having the priority ought to be adopted.

 terior feet rufous. — 4 1. long. Pennsylvania. Rare. 



Scarabozus pensvallensis. Melsh. Catal. 



This is certainly only a mere local variety of A. erraticus, Linn., and may be 

 referred to Mulsant's subgenus Colobopterus, Var. nebulosus. The present na- 

 tive specimen of the species, and the only one ever in our collection, is stated to 

 have been found in Penn's Valley] 



3. A. truncatus. Black; thorax deeply and coarsely punctured; clypeus 

 mutic, emarginate. — 3 I. long. Pennsylvania. 



Scaraboeus caenosus, Melsh. Catal.

 of oblong tufts of short, scaly, ferruginous or black hairs, spaces each with 

 two faint striaa, and sparse minute granules : beneath and feet colored as 

 above. — Allied to T. arenarius, Fabr., and has been considered by some as a 

 variety of that species, but it differs from it, apart of other characters, in 

 having the elytral striae impunctured. It may perhaps be the serrulatus of 

 Pal. de Beauv. 



Bolbocerus, Kirby. 



B. cornigerus. Red-brown ; head armed with a long filiform horn ; thorax 

 greatly unequal; elytra crenate-striate. — 5 1. long, 3 1. wide. Pennsyl-

 small indentation and mucro on the middle of the anterior margin of the 

 thorax, in having the thorax less punctured, in the scutellum being longer, 

 narrower and impunctured, and in being considerably less pilose beneath.

Var. Cyaneous ; feet dark violaceous. 



Geotrupes miarophagus, Say. Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc. iii. 211. Melsh. 

 Catal. No. 16. This species is more robust than either splendidus, Fabr., 

 or excrement/', Say. It is generally deep black, with but a very slight tinge 

 of blue ; the medial thoracic groove is wider and more strongly defined than 

 in splendidus and excrementi, in the latter it is sometimes wanting. In 

 blackburnii the elytral striae are almost impunctured, but in miarophagus 

 they are profound and crenate, more strongly and entirely than in splendidus 

 or excrementi.

December, 1844.] 163 



Professor Johnson exhibited specimens of coal coke, cinders, and 

 lumps of pyrites, from a heap of about 250 tons of bituminous coal, 

 from the line of tho summit portage Railroad, in Cambria county, 

 Pennsylvania. This coal had been lying for five or six months in 

 the coal yard of Mr. Nathan Middleton, south west corner of Ridge 

 Road and Willow street, and was yesterday morning (December 2, 

 1844,) found to be on fire from spontaneous combustion, burning 

 through a board fence between the coal yard and the adjoining pre- 

 mises, very near the ground. The height of the pile, above the 

 point where combustion commenced, was about nine or ten feet. 

 On applying a thermometer at three feet distance, in a horizontal 

 direction from the fire, the temperature was found to be only 70 

 degrees ; but by digging down over the same point to within four 

 feet of the level of the fire, the temperature was 160 degrees. 



One of the specimens exhibited, on a surface of deposition, a yel- 

 lowish while pellicle of pyrites, which, from the minuteness of the 

 crystals, resembles frost-work ; another has distinct plies or scams 

 of the sulphuret continued through the lumps; a third is a nodular 

 lump of nearly pure pyrites ; and a fourth is a fragment of a reni- 

 form mass of the same material, weighing upwards of three pounds, 

 with a film of adhering coal. The interior of the mass is some- 

 what porous, with slight intermixture of carbonaceous matter; while 

 the exterior is a shell of much more compact structure. Clusters 

 of crystals, of considerable magnitude, are here and there seen. On 

 the part coated with coal are seen films or dissepiments, penetrating 

 the coal at right angles to the surface of the kidney-shaped mass. 

 On one side the coal has been polished, apparently by sliding under 

 immense pressure over some hard substance, giving it the appear- 

 ance of " slickensides." In this part, the projecting partitions of 

 sulphuret of iron, as well as the coal, have been broken down, 

 crushed and flattened, and the direction in which the folia have been 

 bent, marks that of the motion which had occurred in the bed. 



Professor Johnson also exhibited the peroxide of iron adhering to 

 the coke formed in this spontaneous ignition, and referred to the de- 

 composition of sulphate of iron, without access of air, as capable of 

 producing that oxide. Also, to the simultaneous development of 

 anhydrous sulphuric acid and sulphurous acid as the volatile pro- 

 ducts. The latter acid, when generated in the combustion or dis- 

 tillation of bituminous coal, passes off in combination with ammonia, 




164 [December, 1844. 



giving rise to the sulphite of ammonia, one of the known products 

 of the gas making process. 



Reference was made to the first volume of the Proceedings, page 

 140, for an account of another case, not of actual combustion, but 

 of the heating to 110° of a heap of coal from the same coal district; 

 and to an instance which had come under the observation of Prof. 

 Johnson, at Lowell, Massachusetts, where, having found a tem- 

 perature of 160° in a heap of Sidney, Nova Scotia, coal, at a dis- 

 tance of three feet from the surface, a period of 50 days was allowed 

 to elapse, in which time it actually took fire. 



The importance to coal dealers of attending to the character of that 

 which they store and keep on hand for months, was rendered apparent 

 by the occurrence now alluded to. Had the combustion occurred on 

 another side of the heap, ii would have set fire to a coachmaker's shop 

 filled with combustible materials. Had it been on ship-board, the 

 planks and timbers might have been charred, or the vessel set on 

 fire, with scarcely the possibility of extinguishing the flames. The 

 decomposition of sulphuret of iron, found in such abundance in this 

 coal, aided by air and moisture, affords a ready solution of this and 

 similar occurrences. 



Dr. Gibbons exhibited a diagram, intended to show the 

 path of the thermometer as compared with that of the baro- 

 meter, in which the great fluctuations of the former instru- 

 ment are observed to follow those of the latter at a distance 

 of about thirty-six hours. 



Also a table, showing that the mean temperature of the 

 last six days of November, for a period of seventeen years, 

 ending 1843, is lower than that of the first six days of De- 

 cember, by 0°.S7.

Professor Johnson read a continuation of his paper on the 

 calorific power of coals, and particularly on the Osage coal 

 of Missouri, and on a specimen of pure bitumen. He then 

 gave a resume of the several varieties of coal which he had 

 assayed, and compared the practical evaporative powers, as 

 determined by steam generating operations, with the calcu- 

 lated powers of the same coals, as ascertained by determining 

 the proportion of its carbon constituent. The accordance is 

 very striking, being 10.701 for the mean of the results given 

 by steaming operations, and 10.691 by ultimate analysis. An 

 abstract of this valuable and elaborate paper will be furnished

mens of natural history above announced as received in

Dr. Morton read a communication from Dr. Alfred T. 

 King, of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, and intended for publi- 

 cation, in relation to the fossil foot marks found in his vicinity, 

 casts of which were presented by him at a late meeting of 

 the Academy. Referred to the following committee: Dr. 

 Morton, Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Cassin. 



Dr. Morton submitted the following observations on the 

 measurements of the internal capacity of the crania deposited 

 by him this evening. 



In the Society's Proceedings for December, 1841, I com- 

 municated the result of the internal measurement of forty-five 

 skulls of native Africans, of the Bassa, Grabbo, Makoua, 

 Benguela, Mina, Mozambique and other but undetermined 

 tribes. Those measurements gave 85 cubic inches for the 

 internal capacity of the cranium, or size of the brain. More 

 recently I have received, through the kindness of Dr. Goheen, 

 twelve additional skulls of native Africans, of which ten are 

 adult, and afford the following measurements: 



The largest heads in the series are those of two Kroomen, 

 which afford respectively a capacity of 92 and 95 cubic 

 inches. The smallest head, that of a female, (tribe unknown,) 

 measured but 65 cubic inches, which is the smallest adult 

 cranium I have hitherto met with; while the mean of all 

 gives a fraction more than S4 cubic inches. Of this series of 

 heads, nine are male, and one is female ; and they are de- 

 rived from the Kroo, Golah, Pessah, Dey, and Eboe tribes. 



In addition to these, I possess a single female Hottentot 

 skull, which measures 68 cubic inches ; and if we take the 

 mean of the whole adult series of fifty-six crania, we find it 

 to be about 85 cubic inches, which may be assumed as the 

 average bulk of the brain in the Negro race ; thus confirm- 

 ing, in a very satisfactory manner, the results of my previous 

 observations.

The Committee on Mr. Conrad's paper on new fossil 

 shells of the United States, reported in favor of publication. 



Descriptions of eight new Fossil Shells of the United States. 



By T. A. Conrad. 



Miocene Species. 



Crefidula. 



Crepidula cymbseformis. Elliptical, very profound or ventricose ; thick 

 about the region of the beak; apex inclined towards the left margin, acute, 

 separated from the margin of the aperture ; umbo compressed, prominent ; 

 aperture dilated above the middle and rapidly narrowed towards the end 

 opposite the beak ; diaphragm concave and remote from the margin. Length 

 1| inch. 



Locality. Petersburg, Virginia. 



The boat-shaped outline of this shell serves to distinguish it. from its con- 

 geners. It is the deepest or most ventricose of all the smooth species of the 

 Union. 



Eocene species. 

 Cardita. 



Cardita densata. Obliquely cordate, ventricose, thick, with about 

 twenty-five flattened costaj, obsolete towards the base, narrow, profound, 

 elevated and crenulated on the umbo ; umbo very prominent at the apex ; 

 anterior basal margin obliquely subtruncated ; posterior extremity truncated, 

 direct; cardinal area very thick and dilated, the teeth oblique. Height If 

 inch. Length the same. 



Locality. Claiborne, Alabama. 



This pretty species abounds in entire specimens in the argillaceous stratum 

 near low water mark in the Claiborne Bluff. I found none in the upper 

 beds. Compared with C. planicosta, it is much smaller, comparatively 

 shorter, thicker, and may always be readily distinguished by the crenulated 

 ribs on the umbo. 



Cytherea. 



Cytherea subimpressa. Ovate, slightly ventricose, smooth and polished, 

 with concentric slightly impressed lines on the anterior side ; anterior side 

 short, rather acutely rounded ; posterior side produced, acutely rounded at 

 the extremity ; dorsal margin long, oblique, slightly curved ; beaks promi- 

 nent ; lunule lanceolate, defined by a slightly impressed line. Length l£ inch. 

 Height JL inch. 



Locality. Marlbourne, Hanover county, Virginia. Mr. Ruffin. 




174 [December, 1S44. 



This species may be distinguished from C. sequorea, by its greater com- 

 parative length, smaller size, and in wanting the strong furrows of that spe- 

 cies. Mr. Ruffin obtained several entire specimens. 



C. liciata. Suboval, thin and fragile, convex-depressed, surface with mi- 

 nute, closely arranged concentric lines ; anterior margin rather acutely 

 rounded ; posterior margin obtusely rounded or subtruncated obliquely out- 

 wards, the extremity rounded ; lunule lanceolate, defined by an obscure line; 

 beaks prominent, and profoundly curved towards the anterior margin. Length 



1 inch. Height _ 8 _ inch. 



° 10 



Locality. Marlbourne, Hanover county, Virginia. Mr. Ruffin. 



This species is related to C. ovata, Rogers, but is more compressed, less 

 dilated posteriorly, the striae more numerous and distinct on the middle of 

 the valves, while the ovata has there only lines of growth. 



C. eversa. Suborbicular or lentiform, ventricose, surface with fine, closely 

 arranged concentric lines ; anterior and posterior extremity rounded ; basal 

 margin profoundly rounded, and forming a regular curve from the extremi- 

 ties ; umbo broad, with a prominent apex ; lunule ovate-acute, marked by a 

 well defined impressed line ; cardinal teeth robust. Length If inch. Height 

 If inch. 



Locality. Marlbourne, Hanover county, Virginia. 



This shell has much the exterior aspect of an Artemis. Mr. Ruffin has 

 one specimen with both valves. It occurs at Marlbourne, the residence of 

 Edmund Ruffin, Esq., who is making important investigations in the Eocene 

 deposits of that locality. He has kindly sent me beautiful specimens of 

 C ardit a plant xosta and Cardium Nicu licit, together" with the new species of 

 Cytherea above described. 



C. pyga. Suboval, ventricose, thick, with closely arranged robust con- 

 centric lines; umbo wide, prominent above; dorsal margin very oblique, 

 rounded ; posterior extremity obtusely and obliquely rounded inwards ; an- 

 terior extremity much narrower than the posterior, and more acutely 

 rounded ; lunule lanceolate, defined by a distinct impressed line ; cardinal 

 teeth robust. Length If inch. Height 1^ inch. 



Locality. Potomac river, Stafford county, Virginia. Mr. BrufF. 



I am indebted to Mr. BrufF, of Washington, for an opportunity to describe 

 this species. The specimen is a right valve, very perfect, and in outline 

 has some resemblance to C. liciata, but is larger, thicker, more ventricose, 

 with much wider umbones, &c. 



Pecten. 



Pecten elixatus. Suborbicular, inferior valve ventricose, with fourteen 

 wide, elevated, rounded ribs, and with concentric wrinkles. Height \\ 

 inches. 



Locality. Near Santee canal, South Carolina. 



Occurs in friable white limestone. 




December, 1S44.J 175 



Carboniferous species. 

 Bellekophron. 



Bellerophron scissile. Dilated, profoundly ventricose from the margins 

 of the aperture, and with coarse, transverse, irregular lines ; back subangu- 

 lated medially and with a medial channel, angulated and slightly carinated 

 on the margins, the channel profound from the margin of the aperture to the 

 middle of shell, and obsolete on the other portion of the back. Length 2 

 inches. 



Locality. St. Genevieve. 



The Committee on a communication from Dr. Alfred T. 

 King, of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, describing fossil foot 

 marks recently discovered in his vicinity, reported in favor 

 of publication. 



Description of Fossil Foot Maries, supposed to be referable to the 

 classes Birds, Reptilia and Mammalia, found in the carboni- 

 ferous series, in Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania. 



By Alfred T. King, M. D. 



The petrifaction of tracks of animals once almost universally doubted, is 

 now no longer a problem to be solved, and Ichnolology or Ichnolithology is 

 admitted as a distinct branch of Paleontology. It is but an extension of the 

 principle of Cuvier, who proved experimentally, " that when we find merely 

 the extremity of a well preserved bone, we are able, by a careful examina- 

 tion, assisted by analogy and exact comparison, to determine the species to 

 which it once belonged, as certainly as if we had the entire animal before us." 

 Professor Kauss, of Germany, Rev. Dr. Duncan, of Scotland, and Professor 

 Hitchcock, of Amherst College, have described various and singular foot 

 marks in the upper new red sand stone, but so far as my information extends, 

 they have never found either the inhumed bones, or any other decided indica- 

 tions of the existence of Birds, Reptilia and Mammalia, as early as the car- 

 boniferous period. If I am correct in this statement, the discovery which I 

 am about to announce of the vivid imprint of the feet of animals referable to 

 these classes, and to this epoch, must be regarded with no ordinary interest 

 by geologists. 



If the discovery of bird tracks by Professor Hitchcock, in 1836, as low as 

 the upper new red sand-stone, was received with scepticism by geologists, 

 their doubts may now be renewed with increased strength, when it is an- 

 nounced that birds existed analogous to our Grallatores, and left their foot 

 marks in arenaceous mud, ages anterior to the deposite of the sand-stone of 

 Connecticut river. 



Professor Hitchcock originally denominated the bird tracks which he 



21 




176 



[December, 1S44. 



described Ornithichnites, or stony bird-tracks, but afterwards changed the 

 name to Ornithoidichnites, or tracks resembling those of birds. I am unable 

 to perceive the propriety of this change, inasmuch as it is universally con- 

 ceded that the tracks were made by birds. I trust, therefore, I shall be 

 pardoned for making use of the original, and, in my view, more correct and 

 appropriate term, Ornithichnites. 



The first track which I shall describe is one evidently m^de by a bird, 

 referable to the order Grallae, and allied to our Gallinules. I shall therefore 

 call it the 



No. 1.* Ornithichnites gallinuloides. — Toes 

 4 , three before, pointing forwards, almost entirely 

 separate, leptodactylous ; middle toe much the 

 longest ; spread of lateral toes 95°; hind toe point- 

 ing directly backwards (on one foot slight inclina- 

 tion inwards) on the same plane with the front 

 ones ; all the toes have long and pointed claws ; 

 length of the foot about nine inches ; length of 

 the step not easily determined, as it seemed to 

 vary from two to fifteen or eighteen inches. 



No. 2. Ornithichnites Culbertsonii. I have named 

 this impression after my friend Alexander Culbertson, 

 Esq. , a gentleman of acute and penetrating mind, an ac- 

 curate and original observer of all subjects pertaining 

 to either morals or physics, and who had the kindness 

 first to direct my attention to these singular bird tracks. 

 The toes are 4, and much resemble the preceding, but 

 the hind toe is longer ; the front ones spread at an angle 

 of 70° ; length of the foot 4| inches ; length of the 

 step uniformly 11 inches. The tracks were nearly 

 in a straight line, and traceable over ten or twelve 

 feet surface, the last step leaving a vivid imprint on the perpendicular side 

 of the stone. This seems to indicate that the position of the rock has been 

 changed since these birds walked upon it, and left their foot prints upon the 

 then plastic mud, for the wonder and speculation of man in after ages Ordi- 

 nary observers have uniformly compared these tracks to those made by wild 

 turkevs ; but it does not require much ornithological knowledge to detect 



This, and the succeeding cuts, are one-fourth of the size of the original 



drawings. 




December, 1S44.] 177 



the incorrectness of this opinion. '?• The hind toe of all gallinaceous birds is 

 comparatively short, and is articulated with the tarsus higher than the rest. 

 When the bird is walking, this toe. therefore, scarcely touches the ground at 

 the tip. In one stony track, the hind toe is long, on the same level with the 

 front ones, and the imprint is deep and vivid. 



No. 3, 1 imagine, is the track of an immense 

 Saurian reptile, for which I suggest the name of 

 Thenaeopus* leptodadylus. The toes are five, 

 slender, spreading, like an open fan, 160°; 

 they are two inches long, with distinct claws; 

 the extreme spread five inches, leaving an in- 

 terval of one inch between each toe ; the ball 

 of the foot is spherical, and near 2£ inches 

 across it. 



No. 4 is the Thenaeopus pachydadylus. 

 Toes are five, short and thick ; the imprint is 

 deep ; the spread of the toes b\ inches. The 

 track resembles somewhat the preceding, but 

 the toes are shorter, thicker, the imprint is 

 deeper, and the foot is considerably larger. 



Nos. 5, 6. I am unable to form even a probable con- 

 jecture in regard to the class of animals to which it 

 should be referred. There is certainly some resem. 

 blance to the order Digitigrada, but as it is extremely 

 improbable that these animals should be associated 

 with aquatic birds and saurian reptiles, or that they 

 should be even represented at this early period of 

 our planet, during its half finished condition, and 

 while the proportion of land to water must have 

 been far less than what it is at the present day, I 

 have almost abandoned the idea. It may have been 

 an animal in some respects allied to the Hippopota- 

 mus. At all events, I shall venture the provisional 

 name of Thenaeopus sphserodadylus. Toes are 5, 

 spherical, arranged in a circle, spreading about 240°, 

 or two-thirds of a circle. The ball of the foot is 



* From £ mp> a palm, and rfovj, a foot— a. palm-footed animal ; which 

 generic name may serve, at least provisionally, for several others of this 

 series of foot marks. 




178 [December, 1S44. 



spherical, and about one and a half inches across it. The track is four 

 inches in its transverse and conjugate diameters. In the specimen before 

 us, the ball of the foot is situated in the centre, the toes spreading regu- 

 larly around it ; but in some it stands out behind and completes the digital 

 circle. 



No. 7. Thenaropus ovoidactylus. Toes 

 5, ovoid, spreading about 240°. This is 

 evidently the track of a very large ani- 

 mal. Each toe is about an inch long, 

 and their spread near six inches. The 

 ball of the foot is about two and a half 

 inches across it. 



The stone on which these tracks were found has an exposed surface of 

 fifteen by twenty feet, rising like the other rocks in the neighborhood to the 

 west, and dipping at a small angle to the east. It is a coarse grained sand 

 stone, about 150 feet beneath the largest of our coal seams, and near 800 feet 

 beneath the topmost stratum of our coal formation. From the fact of the 

 existence of numerous holes or pots, some of which will hold fifteen or 

 twenty gallons, excavated, as we know they are at the present day, by the 

 whirling of pebbles, set in motion by a running stream, I infer that the stone 

 must have lain in the bed of a river which was subject to partial periodical 

 desiccation. These pots, which bear a striking resemblance to those now 

 found in our neighboring rivers, particularly the, Yonghiogheny, were the 

 objects of curiosity to the people of the neighborhood for years; but the 

 tracks, though often noticed, were comparatively unimportant, as they pre- 

 sumed they were made by dogs, bears, wild turkeys, and other animals 

 belonging to the present order of animated nature. 



To the geologist, however, they are of more interest. He looks through 

 the long vista of time which has elapsed since the stone on which these tracks 

 are now found was plastic sand or arenaceous mud — contemplates its con- 

 solidation into stone — the subsequent excavation of these pots by whirling 

 pebbles — the deposition of sandstone, limestone, shale, and numerous beds of 

 coal, amounting, in all, in this vicinity, to about 800 feet. And after all 

 these various changes, which required hundreds, end perhaps thousands of 

 years to accomplish, he views with his mind's eye the vast agency, the over- 

 whelming power, which doubtless convulsed the whole western continent, 

 contorting the crust of the earth, and upheaving our vast Apalachian 

 chain of mountains, extending from New York to Alabama, and at the same 

 time throwing the main strata into beautiful folds, or elongated anticlinal 

 roots. And finally, he contemplates the slow upheaval of the continent from 

 the bed of the primeval ocean — the subsidence of the waters — the quiescence 

 of the earth — and the various successive races of animals and plants, both 

 visible and microscopic, which preceded the present order of animated

existences. All this, doubtless, occurred, and probably in the order we 

 have mentioned ; since these animals sported in their native elements, basked 

 on the oozy shore of a river or an ocean, and left the vivid imprint of their 

 feet in its plastic mud. These are a few inferences from established data, 

 which give beauty to geology, interest to these foot marks, and which are 

 well calculated to impress the mind with sublime and stupendous concep- 

 tions. 



In another locality, about twelve miles distant, but in the same synclinal 

 axis, on a slab of fine grained micaceous sandstone, which was taken from a 

 quarry about fifty feet beneath the rock already described, I found beautiful 

 imprints of hind and fore feet of an animal which I have ventured to refer to 

 the class Mammalia, and order Marsupialia. The hind and fore feet 

 are obviously different. On the hind foot the toes are five ; on the fore foot 

 there are but four ; the plantar surface on the hind foot is long, narrow, and 

 terminates in a distinct heel ; the fifth toe, whose imprint is feint, stands out 

 almost at a right angle with the foot, and much resembles the human thumb. 

 Indeed, the whole track does not look unlike the imprint of the human hand. 

 The length of the foot is five and a half inches ; the extreme spread of the 

 toes five and three-quarter inches ; the interval between the toes is from one, 

 to one and a half inches; length of the toes three inches. The fourth toe on 

 the fore foot stands out obliquely, like the fifth toe on the hind foot; length 

 of toes two and a-quarter inches ; length of the foot four and a half inches ; 

 the extreme spread of the toes four and three-quarter inches ; the interval 

 between the toes from one to two inches ; the nails are quite distinct, At 

 the external side of all the tracks there is a protuberance, which resembles 

 the rudiment of another toe. The plantar surface is round and full, and 

 seems to indicate that the greatest weight of the animal was before ; at all 

 events, the fore feet seem to have sunk more deeply into the plastic mud on 

 which these animals sported in the pristine ages of the world. The tracks 

 were in relief. I found but one that was in has relief. The fore and hind 

 foot follow each other very closely, there being an interval of only about two 

 inches between them. The length of the step was about twenty inches.* 

 I have given the average size of these truly remarkable tracks, but a few 

 were discovered, though not very distinct, at least two or three inches larger. 

 The slab was large, and contained twelve or fourteen very vivid imprints, 

 together with many that were not so distinct. 



This discovery evidently conflicts with an hypothesis long since thrown 

 out, and still maintained by distinguished geologists, that the atmos- 



* The apparent shortness of the animal in proportion to the size, (for it 

 must have been large.) the sluggishness of its movements — which may be 

 inferred from the fact of the feet not tracking together, and the difference in 

 the number of toes on fore and hind foot — seem to indicate an alliance with 

 the Batrachia. 




180 [December, 1S44. 



phere, during the carboniferous period, was essentially different from 

 what it is at present. It was supposed that it contained a much larger 

 amount of carbonic acid gas, which, by absorption, caused the rapid and 

 enormous growth of the coal plants. This could not have been, since we 

 now find that lung-breathing animals existed at the same epoch. 



The Reports of the Corresponding Secretary, of the Libra- 

 rian, and of the Treasurer of the Publication Committee, were 

 severally read and adopted. 



The Report of the Treasurer was read, and referred to the 

 Auditors. 



The Recording Secretary read his Annual Report, which 

 was, on motion, referred to the Committee on Proceedings. 



REPORT 



OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY, 

 For 1844. 



The original design in requiring from the Recording Secretary of this Society 

 an annual Report of its transactions, may be considered now as nearly super- 

 ceded by the plan adopted within the last few years of publishing its " Proceed- 

 ings'' at short intervals. In addition to the various written and verbal commu- 

 nications made to the Society, this periodical contains extracts from the minutes 

 of all other matter which the committee, having charge of its publication, may 

 deem useful or important to be made known. 



Its pages may, therefore, be appealed to with confidence, for affording 

 abundant information to enable all who may choose_ to examine them, to form 

 an opinion of the character of its transactions, and of the degree of progress 

 which it has made in a twelve-month. 



The present report will, therefore, merely contain a short summary of the 

 contents of the Proceedings of the present year, together with a few additional 

 facts, not generally familiar to the members, and which may perhaps be inter- 

 esting to them. 



Perhaps, at no period since its organization, have the standing and prospects 

 of the Society afforded higher gratification to its members, than at present. 

 The cabinet has been enhanced in value and utility by an unusual amount of 

 contributions to its various departments, in some of which, in fact, should the 

 increase continue in the same ratio for a few years longer, there will be little or 

 nothing for the Institution to desire. New and neat ranges of cases have been 

 constructed within the last few months, for accommodating the large additions 

 of books and specimens. Every gallery is now occupied, and we have at 

 length the satisfaction of seeing the interior arrangements of this spacious and 

 commodious Hall completed in accordance with the design originally contem- 




December, 1844.] 181 



plated. For the accomplishment of these desirable objects, the Society is 

 indebted to the active efforts of the Curators, and other members. 



In number, variety, and aggregate value, the communications to the Society 

 in 1844, which have been published, will more than bear comparison with 

 those of any previous period, and furnish additional proof of the fact stated in 

 former reports, that this modejof publication is annually increasing in impor- 

 tance and advantage to it, and is therefore eminently deserving of its continued 

 attention and care. 



The report of the Treasurer will show that some financial arrangements 

 have been effected by him during the year, materially benefitting the Society ; 

 and that the efforts of this officer are still zealous and constant to secure to it 

 whatever advantages circumstances may place in his power. 



It is doubtless still within the recollection of most of those present, that the 

 long pending claim of the Society for $5,000 upon the heirs of an estate, 

 (being the amount of a mortgage upon the latter, presented to the Academy by 

 its late President, William Maclure,) was settled in the course of la-t year by 

 a compromise between the parties, the Academy agreeing to accept from the 

 heirs, in payment of the claim, about $4,550, in Pennsylvania five per cent, 

 stock, at its original value. Mr. Alexander Maclure, desirous of carrying out 

 the wishes and intentions of his brother to the full extent, tendered to the 

 Academy, a few months since, the difference between the original claim and 

 the amount accepted from the heirs. This sum, about $450, has been received, 

 and is now in the Treasury. The Academy owes its sincere thanks to this 

 gentleman, both for his promptness and the generous motives which influenced 

 him in this matter. The State stock still remains in the hands of the 

 Treasurer, under the hope, which recent circumstances have contributed to 

 strengthen, that its par value will ultimately be realized by the Academy. 



The donations to the Museum, in the different departments, have been 

 numerous and valuable, as has been already stated. 



Of the Mammalia, donations of skins and mounted specimens have been 

 received from Dr. Wm. Blanding, Dr. Reynell Coates, Oliver Evans, Esq., Mr. 

 Kilvington, and also a number in exchange. 



The contributions and additions to the Ornithological collection have been 

 remarkably numerous and valuable. They have been derived chiefly from Mr. 

 Cassin, Dr. Watson, Dr. Blanding, the late Dr. Westley Johnson of Liberia, 

 Dr. Kane, U. S. N., Mr. Woodhouse and others. A number of fine bird skins 

 from Brazil, were purchased by subscription ; and recently, a large addition has 

 been obtained from Sweden, in exchange. 



The members are generally aware of the fact, that the Academy has pos- 

 sessed, for several years, a large and rapidly increasing collection of bird and 

 quadruped skins. Many of these were rare and valuable: the gifts of corres- 

 pondents and friends of the Institution, to some of whom it has been at all 

 times indebted for contributions to its collections. With all the precautions 

 which may be taken, these skins cannot be entirely protected from injuries from 

 insects, dust, and other causes, and the Curators therefore promptly embraced 

 an opportunity, fortunately afforded a few months since, of employing a compe- 

 tent taxidermist, and upon such favorable terms, as to entrust to him the prepa- 




1S2 [December, 1844. 



ration and mounting of specimens of all such species as were not already 

 displayed in the Museum. This individual has now been employed regularly 

 up to the present time, and has accomplished a large amount of work in a very 

 short period, and with much satisfaction to the Curators and the Zoological 

 Committee. The whole number at present mounted and nearly ready to be 

 deposited in the cases, is 219. Of these 172 are birds, and the remainder 

 quadrupeds. 



So large an accession of mounted specimens to the Museum, necessarily 

 required additional accommodations, and accordingly a new and beautiful 

 range of cases is now being erected, occupying the entire length of the lower 

 gal ery on the north side of the Hall. 



I have great pleasure in stating here, that the entire expense incurred in both 

 these improvements, has been defrayed by voluntary contributions from the 

 members alone — to some of whom the Academy is under especial obligations 

 on this occasion. In fact, the spirit of liberality which has always characterized 

 the members of this Institution, has been equally displayed in this undertaking, 

 as in many others, having for their object real advantage to it, and permanent 

 utility. 



Of Reptiles, Fishes, and Crustacea, donations have been made by Dr. Wat- 

 son, Dr. R. Coates, Capt. H. F. Baker, Wm. L. Bispham, Esq., J. Dundas, 

 Esq., Mr. J. G. Howard, Dr. Day, of Liberia, &c. 



The Entomological collection has received numerous additions during the 

 year. From the Rev. Dr. Thomas F. Savage of Africa, a number of very fine 

 insects of that country ; from Dr. Thos. B. Wilson of Delaware, a considerable 

 collection of very perfect American insects; a collection of British Lepidoptera, 

 from Mr. Cassin ; and smaller donations from other individuals. By purchase and 

 exchange, there have also been obtained a very beautiful and numerous collec- 

 tion of Brazilian insects, a number of fine American Lepidoptera, and within 

 the past two weeks, about 300 specimens of European Coleoptera. 



In the last report, I stated that an effort was making not only to improve and 

 increase the Entomological collection, but also to secure it, if possible, from the 

 constant injuries and losses to which it had been hitherto liable. The plan 

 then proposed for the latter purpose has been since adopted, and there is every 

 reason, at present, to suppose that it will prove effectual. 



The interest already taken by the members in the improvement of this de- 

 partment has been such, that the number of specimens has rapidly increased 

 within a short period, and the collection promises to equal very soon, both in 

 size and value, any of those in the other departments. The whole of the 

 Coleoptera which it contains arc now undergoing revision, and an arrangement 

 of the genera after the most modern system. The Academy is indebted, for 

 this advantage, to our fellow-member, Mr. Haldeman, who has voluntarily un- 

 dertaken this task, and upon whose known accuracy and intimate knowledge 

 of the subject, the most implicit reliance can be placed. 



We would again beg leave to call the attention of the members and corres. 



pondents of the Institution to this subject, and to icqucst their further aid in 



the present effort to improve an interesting department of the Society's cabinet. 



To the collection of Shells, the following are the principal donors during the 



the year : Mr. J. G. Anthony, of Ohio ; Rev. Dr. Savage, of Africa ; Mrs. 




December, 1344.] 183 



Lucy W. Say, Mr. Peterson, Mr. Haldcman, and Dr. Gould, of Boston. 

 Others have been derived from Dr. Mighels of Maine, Mr. Cassin, Dr. R. 

 Coates, Capt. Baker; and recently, a very largo accession lias been made 

 through exchange. 



Of Fossils, the donations this year have been fewer than usual. A most 

 interesting one, however, was that by General Irick, of Vincentown, N. J., of 

 the head of a fossil crocodile discovered in the vicinity of that place, and 

 which has formed the subject of a paper by Dr. Morton, who has regarded it 

 as new. Another donation of much value has recently been received from Dr. 

 Alfred T. King, of Westmoreland county, in this State, of fossils from the 

 carboniferous limestone of that region. 



The collection of Crania possessed by Dr. Morton, has been increased 

 during the present year by many additions of great value and interest. This 

 collection is now of such extent as to require, for its display, the entire range 

 of cases on the south flying-gallery, which have been resigned to Dr. Morton 

 for this purpose. It numbers about 600 crania, derived from all the races of 

 men, ancient and modern, and 640 crania of the lower orders of animals, 

 forming an aggregate believed to be greater than is possessed by any other indi- 

 vidual living. 



Additions to the Minerahgical cabinet have been made by Messrs. Ashmead, 

 Johnson, H. S. Stephens, Rice, Woodhouse, Kendall, Mease, Prof. Durbin, and 

 others. But the most important and valuable donation to this department, during 

 the present, or perhaps any previous year, has been that of an entire suite of 

 the minerals of Cumberland, Durham, Westmoreland, and other counties of 

 England, by our fellow-member, Dr. Thomas B. Wilson. This beautiful 

 collection was obtained by this gentleman during his recent visit to that 

 country, and was presented to the Academy immediately upon his return home. 

 It has greatly enriched our Cabinet, and the donor well deserves, and has re- 

 ceived the sincere thanks of the Society. 



In Botany, some donations of value have also been received. They are 

 chiefly from Dr. Englemann, of native Western plants ; from the late Dr. 

 Westley Johnson, of African plants; and from Mr. Jacob Snyder, jr., of this 

 city, of Alpine plants ; besides which, are smaller donations of fruits, seed 

 vessels, single specimens of plants, &c, from a number of contributors. 



The additions to the Library during the present year are as follows : 

 Folios, 4; Quartos, 26; Octavos, 16; Periodicals, (including Journals, Pro- 

 ceedings of Societies, &c.,) 35 ; Publications in pamphlet form, 36 ; and Maps 

 and Charts, 4. Of the whole number, 46 have been received from authors and 

 editors, 27 from members, and 50 from Correspondents, Societies, &c, and 

 also in exchange. The average is about equal to that of late years. 



One of the new ranges of cases erected this season, to which reference has 

 been made at the commencement of this report, was for the use of the Library. 

 The rapid increase of the latter has required this addition for some time past, 

 a large number of volumes having been crowded out of view, for want of room 

 in their appropriate places, and their existence in the library scarcely known to 

 the members. These have now been restored to their proper situations, and a 




1S4 [December, 1844. 



more general distribution of the books has been made by the Library Committee. 

 Labels have been also placed over each case, indicating the nature of its con- 

 tents, and indeed the whole arrangements of the Library, as now made, add 

 greatly to its facilities. 



In an Institution like ours, a Museum, however extensive and systematically 

 arranged, would obviously be of comparatively little advantage without a cor- 

 responding Library of well selected works on subjects of Natural Science. 

 To render it entirely available, as few restrictions as possible should be placed 

 upon it ; and this has always been the object and aim of the Society. Access 

 to the books is at all times freely permitted to the members, and a large propor- 

 tion of them are allowed to be taken from the Hall. But experience has lately 

 proved that these privileges are not without some disadvantages. The Library 

 Committee, while engaged in the duty just mentioned, (of re-arrangement of 

 the books,) discovered that a considerable number were missing. Some of them 

 are works of much value, and which cannot easily be replaced ; and although 

 it is highly probable that many may be recovered through proper efforts, the fact 

 stated would seem to render it incumbent upon the Society to inquire, whether 

 the present regulations, if properly complied with by the members, are suffi- 

 cient for the security of the Library, or whether some further restrictions are 

 necessary. 



From a hasty examination of the Librarian's book of entries of additions to 

 the Library, since the publication of the catalogue in 1836, the number may be 

 estimated at nearly 700, including all except maps and charts. If this number 

 be added to those stated in a report of the Library Committee accompanying 

 the catalogue, to be in the possession of the Academy at the above period, the 

 total now in the Library, including duplicates, would be little short of 8,000. 

 From this estimate, the collection of maps and charts, now numbering about 

 500, is excluded. 



Of the entire number of works in the Library, upwards of 1,500 are exclu- 

 sively on subjects of Natural Science, and about 1,200 others are journals and 

 dictionaries, a large proportion of the contents of which are on similar subjects, 

 and are highly important and often indispensable as works of reference. 



Although, with such a collection of works at his command, the resources of 

 the student of natural history would seem to be ample enough, yet our Library 

 is greatly deficient in modern standard publications in almost every depart- 

 ment. Industrious and active laborers in the cause are now so numerous 

 throughout the world, and the field for investigation still so extensive, that 

 new discoveries are constantly made, new truths developed, and even ma- 

 terials for the formation of new systems collected. To enable our Library to 

 keep pace with the rapid progress of modern Science, it would be necessary for 

 a Library fund to be [established — a measure which the Society has always had 

 in view — and placed in the hands of a competent committee, willing to under- 

 take tho duty of impartially selecting from the numerous publications of the 

 day, such as would be of the greatest practical value to the Institution. 



This subject is not now referred to with the object of urging it upon the 

 Society, or even with the expectation of any action upon it at present, as it in- 

 volves an expenditure which, at this time, cannot be incurred; but it deserves 




December, 1844.] 1S5 



to be always kept in view, and should engage the attention of the Society 

 whenever practicable, as the one now most important to its interests. 



The "Proceedings" are now so closely identified with the character of the 

 Society itself, that a brief sketch of the contents of those numbers which have 

 appeared during the year, can scarcely be omitted in an annual report. 



The support which this publication has received since it originated in 1841, 

 has been highly encouraging, and this has increased during the present year. 

 The second volume was commenced on the first of January last, since which 

 time five numbers have been issued, and the sixth is now in press, and nearly 

 ready for distribution. Together, these numbers will contain between 180 and 

 190 pages of matter, (much of which is in small type,) published in twelve 

 months. This proportion is larger than in any previous similar period since 

 this periodical was commenced by the Society. 



The first number contains a highly interesting letter from I. G. Strain, Esq., 

 U. S. N., one of the correspondents of the Institution. While at Kio Janiero, 

 towards the close of last year, awaiting the completion of his preparations for 

 making a hazardous journey of exploration into the interior of Brazil, he de- 

 voted a portion of his time to the translation of an important paper, which had 

 been communicated by Dr. Lund, of Copenhagen, to a Scientific Society 

 of Brazil, on the subject of some remarkable organic remains which the latter 

 had discovered in the calcareous rocks of that country. This translation was 

 obligingly furnished by Mr. Strain to the Academy, and was published in the 

 Proceedings soon after it was received. The information contained in Dr. 

 Lund's paper, of his discovery of human remains, in a state, to all appearance, 

 fossilized, is of great interest, and if verified by further developements of a 

 similar character, may tend to throw much light on a subject now attracting 

 great attention : the ancient history and physiology of the human race. 



The next communication is by Dr. Morton, being a description of the 

 cranium of a supposed new species of Hippopotamus, to which he has given 

 the name H. minor. The skull had been sent to Dr. Morton by Dr. Goheen 

 of Liberia, Africa, who himself believed it to belong to a species at present 

 unknown to naturalists, although the animal is by no means uncommon in the 

 river St. Pauls, from the banks of which he had obtained the specimens which 

 Dr. Morton possesses. 



A large portion of the succeeding number is occupied by papers describing 

 new species of N. American Coleoptera, from Dr. Melsheimer, and the Rev. 

 Mr. Zeigler, of Pennsylvania; and from Mr. John L. Le Conte, of New York. 

 Dr. M.'s paper, which is long, and includes a large number of species, has been 

 drawn up with great care, and evinces a closeness of observation, and a 

 minuteness of investigation, which are rarely exceeded by those devoted to the 

 study of Entomology. The communications of the two other gentlemen 

 named, are not equal in length, but they are likewise entitled 10 great credit. 



In the third number will be found a paper by Dr. Hallowell, describing new 

 African reptiles. This paper, and another published in the fifth number, will 

 serve to maintain the reputation which the author enjoys, of being a cautious 

 and accurate describer, especially of objects in this department of Natural 

 History. 



Dr. Morton has communicated another paper in the fourth number, describing 




186 [December, 1844. 



a very interesting fossil, the nearly perfect head of a Crocodile, already alluded 

 to, from the Cretaceous strata of New Jersey. To this relic Dr. Morton has 

 given the specific name of Clavirostris, and closes his paper with a list of all 

 the organic remains hitherto discovered in the same strata. 



In the fifth number there is a letter to Professor Espy from several of his 

 friends in this State, in which some facts are stated tending to corroborate 

 his theory that rain may be artificially produced in time of drought. This 

 number also contains a description of some new organic remains from the 

 Eocene of South Carolina by Dr. Ravenel, of Charleston ; a portion of 

 another voluminous paper on N. A. Coleoptera, by Dr. Melsheimer ; the 

 paper by Dr. Hallowell already referred to ; an analysis of sulphur springs 

 in the State of New York by Professor Reid, of the N. Y. College of Pharma- 

 cy; and some interesting observations by Dr. Morton, on a new series of 

 Ancient Egyptian Crania which he had recently received, the characters of 

 which he has been gratified to find fully bear him out in his results previ- 

 ously obtained from the larger collection which form the materials of his 

 Crania Egyptiaca. 



In addition to the different written communications which have been thus 

 hastily noticed, there are a number of others in a verbal form which have 

 been offered before the Society during the year : chiefly from Prof. Johnson 

 and Dr. Morton. The former has given some further results of his exten- 

 sive researches and experiments upon the habitudes and properties of coals 

 of this and other countries, and has greatly added to our knowledge of their 

 comparative value for the purposes of fuel and the arts. 



Between the 1st of December, 1843, and the 1st of the present month, the 

 Society has elected eight new members, and eleven correspondents. Ten of 

 the latter are residents in the United States, and one is foreign. 



And here the present Beport might be closed. But it would appear to be 

 doing injustice to the memory of two of our late fellow members — Dr. 

 Marmaduke Burrough, and Nathan Dunn — were I to omit the opportunity 

 here afforded me of devoting a few words to a notice of each. 



The former, as is well known to all present, passed abroad the greater 

 part of the active period of his life, and during his extensive travels, never 

 failed to acquaint himself with the natural productions of the various coun- 

 tries which he visited. His collections were made less for himself, than for 

 the purpose of affording gratification to his numerous friends, and of enrich- 

 ing the cabinets of those Institutions with which he was connected. But 

 none received so abundant a share of these treasures as the Academy. There 

 is scarcely a department of the museum which will not amply attest this 

 fact. The name of Dr. Burrough is associated with many recollections 

 of benefits conferred on this Institution, and his loss will ever be deplored 

 by her as that of one of her warmest supporters, and most disinterested and 

 active friends. 



From the executors of the late Nathan Dunn we have learned, with min- 

 gled feelings of pleasure and regret, that his will contains a bequest to this 

 Institution of $10,000, but that in consequence of circumstances which need 




December, 1844] 187 



not be referred to here, there is but little probability that the intentions of 

 the testator can be complied with. 



The possession of this sum would not only render the Academy indepen- 

 dent, but it would be also enabled thereby to carry out several favourite 

 projects which have been long contemplated. Whether this bequest be 

 realised or not, however, the Academy is equally bound to record its gratitude 

 for this unexpected instance of noble liberality towards it, and also for the 

 unequivocal evidence which it affords of the testator's approval of the objects 

 for which this Institution was founded. 



All which is respectfully submitted by

Mr. Haldeman exhibited specimens of the male and female, 

 and of the larva and pupa of Corydalus cornutus, and made 

 some remarks upon its habits and structure. The larva is 

 aquatic, but leaves the water and constructs a cavity beneath 

 a stone, in which it changes. The prothorax is much larger 

 in the larva than in the pupa and imago. The mandibles 

 and labrum are prominent at all stages ; the antennae very 

 small in the larva, and situated at the external base of the 

 mandibles. The male of the perfect insect is known by the 

 large arcuate mandibles, and both sexes present the re- 

 markable peculiarity of a vertical perforation through the 

 head, at the anterior base of the antennae.

January, 1S45.] 193 



Tho Chairman read a letter from Mr. Richard K. Haight, 

 dated Paris, 6th November, 1844, acknowledging the receipt 

 of his notice of election as a Correspondent, and in reference 

 to M. Pauthier's work above mentioned. 



Dr. Morton also read the following extracts from a letter ad- 

 dressed to him as Vice President of the Academy, by Dr. 

 Richard Lepsius, the distinguished head of the Prussian sci- 

 entific commission in Egypt, dated Island of Philae, 15th 

 Sept., 1S44. 



" It will interest you, perhaps, to read the summary of the 

 communications made by me to Mr. John Pickering, of Boston, 

 President of the American Oriental Society of that city. They 

 give some of the results of our journey into Ethiopia, and espe- 

 cially in regard to the ancient population of Meroe, their lan- 

 guage, their descendants, and their relation to Egypt, — showing 

 that the Meroites were a people of a red complexion, and that 

 they spoke the language of the Bishariba ^Bisharrees ?] of the 

 present day, which is decidedly Caucasian, and very rich in gram- 

 matical forms, and important on account of the place it occupies 

 among the other Caucasian languages. 



But another remarkable fact which presented itself to us in 

 Ethiopia, may perhaps have a more immediate bearing on the ob- 

 ject of your Society. In the province of Butir-el-Hagar, at a 

 long day's journey above Wady-Halfa, and near the cataract of 

 Semneh, the Nile is contracted between high rocks which ap- 

 proach each other within a distance of three hundred and eighty 

 feet; and on these yet remain the foundations of two very ancient 

 fortresses, erected by the conqueror of the country, Sesourtasen 

 III, (Osortasen,) the fifth king of the twelfth dynasty, and not of 

 the XVIIth dynasty, as hitherto supposed. 



Upon the enormous blocks constituting these structures, as 

 well as upon the rocks themselves, I have found a series of 

 eighteen hieroglyphical inscriptions, of which thirteen belong to 

 the reign of the immediate successor of Osortasen, viz., Amen- 

 enha III, the Mosris of the Greeks, the same who built the pyra- 

 mids and excavated the lake of the Fayoum, as recently dis- 

 covered by M. Linant. The other five inscriptions belong to the 

 last king of the XHth Dynasty, Amenenha IV, and to the first two 




194 [January, 1845. 



kings of the Xlllth Dynasty. All these inscriptions, which em- 

 brace a period of nearly fifty years, have no other object than to 

 mark the height to which the the river rose in the several years 

 of which they bear the date. Independently of the novelty of 

 these inscriptions, which are very short, they possess a great value 

 in enabling us to compare the ancient elevations of the waters of 

 the Nile with those of our own time ; for the oldest of these re- 

 cords dates back to a period of twenty-two hundred years before 

 the Christian era. Thus, the measurements I have made with 

 the greatest care, and which at this place were taken with com- 

 parative facility, on account of the vertical position of the impen- 

 ding rocks, have given the remarkable result, that the average 

 rise of the Nile four thousand years ago, was seven metres, thirty 

 cent, (or about twenty four English feet) higher than it is at the 

 present day. 



It will be readily conceived that this great difference in the 

 level of the river, must have had an important influence upon the 

 soil above the cataracts ; and it directly explains a fact that had 

 previously surprised me, viz: that in all the valley of Nubia, the 

 level of the soil upon both shores, although it consists entirely of 

 alluvium deposited by the Nile, is much more elevated than the 

 highest level of the river in the best year of modern inundation; 

 for the whole country has now to be irrigated by hydraulic ma- 

 chines called Sahie. 



The cataract of Semneh could never have influenced the height 

 of the river between Wady-Halfa and Assouan; but we may sup- 

 pose that the cataract of Assouan was in ancient times much 

 more closed than at present ; because we observe the same eleva- 

 tion of the soil in this part of the valley ; ^between the first and 

 second cataracts.] The mean elevation of the soil above the mean 

 height of the river, is here (Philce) somewhere from three 

 to four metres, (from 10? to 16j feet.) But this same country 

 still presents the traces of a much more ancient state, beyond the 

 record of history, when the granite mountains which separated 

 Ethiopia from Egypt obstructed the passage of the river, and 

 formed real lakes in some localities; as for instance, in the gul- 

 lies or gulfs between the rocks in the Arabian chain, wherein we 

 observe hillocks of Nile earth which rise ordinarily even to ten 

 and eleven metres (thirty-four to thirty-seven feot) above the level 

 of the highest modern inundation. 




January, 1845.] 195 



In reference to the preceding facts, it may perhaps be interesting 

 to the members of your Society to examine some specimens of tho 

 different layers of the earth of the Nile, and I have accordingly 

 sent, in a tin case, the following examples : 



1. Earth of the Nile, taken from the summit of hillocks at 

 thirty feet above the present level of the river, upon its eastern 

 bank, half an hour (about a mile) above Korosco, [nearly sixty 

 miles above Assouan.] 



2. Some of the present soil of the valley of Korosco, taken at 

 a height of three feet above the Nile. 



3. Specimen of the earth newly deposited at Korosco, the 18th 

 of August, 1844. 



4. A little sand taken from the thermal spring at Okme, on 

 the southern frontier of the Province of Butir-el-Hagar, which is 

 the only spring of the kind, to my knowledge, in all the valley of 

 the Nile. It is on the western bank of the river, and issues 

 from the earth at a temperature of 44° Reaum." (130° Fahr.) 



The following extract from another letter from Dr.Lepsius, 

 of the same date, addressed to Mr. Gliddon, was also read by 

 the Chairman. 



" We shall leave this (the Island of Phils) in a few days, and 

 hope to arrive at Thebes in a month. We shall remain there 

 during the winter, and shall return during the spring through Syria, 

 Asia Minor, Constantinople and Greece, to our fatherland, where 

 we shall arrive in the course of the next summer."

202 [February, 1845. 



The Committee to whom was referred a communication by 

 Prof. Johnson, read at the meeting of the 11th inst., reported 

 in favour of publication. 



Prof. Johnson first states some of tho methods which have been hitherto em- 

 ployed by Chemists and others, to ascertain the relative heating powers of fuel. 



1. The heating of water, without converting it into vapour, as practised first 

 by Rumford, and more recently by other experimenters, particularly by Des- 

 pretz and Dulong. The French chemists assume as the unit of calorific 

 power, 1 gram of water heated 1° centigrade, (l.°8 Fahr.) Tho number of 

 such units produced by burning 1 gram of combustible is termed its colorific 

 efficiency. 



2. The melting of ice, as in the calorimeter of Lavoisier and Laplace, also em- 

 ployed by Hasseufratz. The heat of fluidity, (135° Fahr.) is here the mea- 

 sure of effect. 



3. The heating of air, or maintaining a certain difference between an interior 

 room in which combustion is conducted, and an exterior one, kept cool by the 

 open air. The length of time such difference is maintained by a given weight 

 of each fuel, is tho measure of its efficiency. This is the method of Mr. 

 Marcus Bull. 



4. Combustion in contact with metallic oxides, — measuring the heating 

 power by the weight of metal, reduced on the supposition that the latter is pro- 

 portionate to the weight of oxygen withdrawn. This is illustrated by M. 

 Berthier's process by litharge. 



5. The reduction of the nitrate or chlorate of potash to the stale of a carbo- 

 nate, by fusing these salts, and then gradually adding tho combustible, till com- 

 plete saturation has taken place. 



C. The practice of the Cornish engineers, of measuring the efficiency of fuel 

 by the weight of water, which a given bulk of it (as 1 bushel) will raise one 

 foot high, when burned under a boiler driving a pumping engine. 



7. The distillation of the coals to ascertain the weight of fixed carbon which 

 they contain, suggested by the experiments of Mr. Pfyfe, of Edinburgh ; the 

 weight of that constituent being supposed to measure the heating power. 



8. Ultimate analysis ,• which assumes that the quantity of heat developed 

 by an organic combustible, depends on the heating power of tho carbon which 

 it contains, added to that of its excess of hydrogen, above what is required to 

 combine with its oxygen in forming water. This method has been applied by 

 Messrs. Peterson and Schoedler to wood, and by Richardson, Regnault and 

 others, to coals. 



9. The director practical trial by evaporation, as practised by Messrs. Parkes, 

 Wickstced, Pfyfe, Schanfhautl and Manby in Great Britain, by Messrs. S. L. 

 Dana, A. A. Hayes, J. A. Francis, and more recently by Prof. J. himself in 

 this country. (The results of tho trials last referred to are contained in the 

 Report to the Navy Department on American coals recently published by 

 Congress ) 



10. The melting of iron either in a revcrberatory or a cupola furnace, the 

 weight of metal fused by one part of combustible boing the standard of com- 

 parison. 




February, 1845.] 203 



11. The performance of smith's work of a uniform character, such as the 

 manufacturing of chains by means of the several varieties of fuel. The number 

 of links of chain formed by a given weight of each coal, is here the measure of 

 useful effect. 



Tho object of the present communication is mainly to exhibit the relation 

 between the results obtained by the eighth, and thoso by the ninth method of 

 trial above mentioned. 



The existence, in bituminous coals, of variable proportions of nearly pure 

 charcoal, is referred to as furnishing evidence of a want of homogeneousness in 

 this class of bodies. A diversity of results may consequently be expected when 

 ultimate analysis is resorted to for the purpose of establishing a theory of trans- 

 mutations, or of demonstrating what changes have occurred in bringing vegeta- 

 ble substances into the state of bituminous coal. Thoso who assume woody 

 fibre as the sole basi3 from which it has been derived, do not pretend to prove 

 that the other proximate constituents of vegetables, the resinous matter, for ex- 

 ample, and the oily component of seeds, have been wholly removed. Hence 

 analyses of coal applied to this purpose may not always lead to unobjectionable 

 inferences. But as means of determining the calorific power of combustible 

 bodies, they may, especially when performed on average samples, or multiple 

 specimens, afford information both interesting to science and valuable to the 

 arts. 



The relation between the calorific power calculated from analysis, and the 

 practical heating power decided by evaporating water, is determined for 6ix 

 different varieties of bituminous coals, varying considerably in their composition. 

 Drawings of the apparatus employed for both these purposes were exhibited, 

 and their action explained. That used in evaporation is so constructed as to 

 determine the proportion of heat expended on the products of combustion, as 

 well as that employed to generate steam. 



In applying calculations to the ultimate analyses of coals as well as to the 

 products of combustion, the atomic weight of carbon is assumed to be six, of 

 oxygen eight, and of nitrogen fourteen times that of hydrogen, in accordance 

 with tho recent determinations of Dumas. In calculating evaporativo powers, 

 the latent heat of steam is taken at 1030° Fahr., according to Prof. J.'s own 

 investigations of that subject. 



In ascertaining the relative efficiencies and values of combustible bodies, with 

 a view to economical applications, it is necessary to take them either as found 

 in nature, or as supplied to commerce, including, of course, whatever impurities 

 they may chance to contain. But in order to deduce general relations between 

 bodies differently constituted, in regard particularly to their combustible con- 

 stituents, the comparison must be made after deducting the waste, or ineombus- 

 tible matter found in the crude state of the fuel. This principle is applied both 

 to the ultimate analysis and to the evaporative experiments ; and hence in the 

 following table both the calculated evaporative power of the carbon constituent, 

 (column 15,) and the total evaporative efficiency by experiment, (column 18,) 

 aro referred to, and calculated for, one part by weight of combustible matter. 



The relation between the fixed and the volatile combustible matters of coals, 

 is liable to considerable variation, according to the rate of distillation to which 

 they arc subjected. The more slowly this process is conducted, the higher (within 




204 [February, 1S45, 



certain limits) will be the proportion of fixed carbon.* The estimation of heat- 

 ing powers, therefore, from the quantity of fixed carbon which coals contain, if 

 not wholly erroneous in principle, must be liable to considerable uncertainty in 

 practice. 



Many highly bituminous coals contain more than 5 per cent, of materials 

 convertible into ammoniacal liquor by simple distillation without contact of air. 

 This is proved on the largest 6cale in the manufacture of illuminating gas. 

 That proportion, therefore, is not only unavailable for heating purposes, but it 

 also abstracts from the really combustible materials of the fuel, all the heat, sen- 

 sible and latent, which the vaporized ammoniacal products receive during com- 

 bustion. 



The proper water of combustion, namely, that derived from the hydrogen in 

 excess, and oxygen of the atmosphere, must in every instance where heat is ap- 

 plied to evaporate water above the boiling point, as in all ordinary steam boilers, 

 be likewise incapable of giving up its latent, as well as much of its sensible 

 heat. 



The average specific gravity of the 6ix varieties of bituminous coals assayed 

 is 1.31, — that of water at 60° being unity. Admitting the hydrogen in its solid 

 state to have a density of only 1.25, it must in passing into the state, first of 

 gaseous hydrogen, and then into that of watery vapour, (still having the same 

 bulk as the hydrogen,) undergo an enlargement to 2117 times its original bulk. 

 This volume is farther increased according to the usual law of gaseous expan- 

 sion, by whatever heat above boiling point is left in the vapour, when it passes 

 away from the surface to be heated. In a well constructed evaporative appa- 

 ratus producing steam of 6 pounds pressure, in which the circuit traversed by 

 the gases after passing the grate, and before reaching the chimney, was 121 feet, 

 the temperature was generally about 100° above the boiling point; and the 

 watery vapour, being of course surcharged with heat, possessed 2431 times the 

 bulk which it had in the solid state and at 60 degrees of temperature. 



By the experiments of Dulong, (Comptes Rendus, torn. 7,-j-) one gram "of 

 pure carbon developes, in burning, heat enough to raise the temperature of 7170 

 grams of water, 1° centigrade, or 12906 grams 1° Fahrenheit. This latter 

 number is, therefore, used as a co-efficient, by which to multiply the numbers 

 in the 12th column of the following table to obtain those of the 15th. By the 

 same authority, 1 gram of gaseous hydrogen gives heat sufficient to raise 62,535 

 grams of water 1° Fah. 



The average excess of hydrogen for the six varieties of coal tried by evapora- 

 tion, as deduced from columns 13 and 14 of the table, is 4.636 per cent, which, 

 calculated after the manner of the European chemists, ought to possess an eva- 

 porative power of 2.814. This would raise the average of the 15th column 

 from 10.700 to 13.514, as the calculated evaporative power of the unit of com- 

 bustible matter, showing the calculated to be 26.3 per cent, higher than the ex- 

 perimental effect.

[February, 1S45. 



The data furnished by the preceding table afford the means of ascertaining 

 the proportion of its carbon volatilized in the distillation of the combustible 

 matter in each kind of coal. 



The calculations prove that of its whole ca;bon-con6tituent, the per centage 

 volatilized, was as follows. 



Cambria county coal 16.767

And that the average, was 20.883 



The identity of results obtained in the averages of the 15th and 18th columns 

 should seem to demonstrate that the heating power of bituminous coals is pro- 

 portionate to the carbon which they severally contain.

 read and adopted.

A communication from Mr. Haldeman was read, dated

 exchange of publications with the "Swiss General Association

A paper by Dr. Hallowell, entitled "Descriptions of Rep- 

 tiles from South America, supposed to be new;" and a 

 second paper, entitled " Descriptions of new species of African 

 Reptiles," were read and referred to the following committee, 

 viz. : Dr. Blanding, Rev. Mr. McFarland, and Dr. Hol- 

 brook. 



Professor Johnson made some remarks on a recent occurrence 

 of the adhesion and apparently perfect cementation of two steel 

 bars in the cold state, while revolving- in contact with each other. 

 The one, the upright shaft, bearing a heavy mill stone, and the 

 other a cylinder of the same diameter, also standing vertical, and 

 on the head of which the shaft was supported. Both bars were 

 of the same diameter, (rather more than an inch) and their ends 

 were planes running in contact. The muTbeing suddenly arrest- 

 ed and the two bars found strongly united, efforts to separate 

 them proved ineffectual, and the attempt led to a fracture out of 

 the original juncture. 



This occurrence was stated to be in accordance with observa- 

 vations already familiar to those who have studied the phenome- 

 na of cohesion, and particularly the habitudes of steel and iron, 

 when subjected to mechanical motions tending to modify the con- 

 dition of their ultimate molecules. 



The simple pressing together at ordinary temperatures of two 

 clean and plain surfaces of lead causes them to cohere with much 

 tenacity. Two or more portions of the same metal at an elevat- 

 ed temperature, issuing under pressure from a reservoir of semi- 

 fluid metal, may unite under simple pressure to form a continuous 

 tube, so perfect, that it will part at any other section as soon 

 as at the line of juncture. Two disks of glass, perfectly clean, 

 and placed in contact without the intervention of air or of organic 




210 [March, 1845. 



matter, cohere to an extent far beyond what the mere external 

 pressure of the air would be adequate to produce. 



Besides the tendency of similar materials to cohere when 

 brought into close contiguity, the two bars had the farther advan- 

 tage of developing in each other avery highdegree of magnetism. 

 This, their vertical position alone, without motion, being so near 

 the direction of the magnetic dip, would certainly in time pro- 

 duce ; and with the revolving motion, which (as every machinist 

 knows from the operations of boring and drilling) produces a high 

 magnetic state, it would occur with much greater promptitude and 

 intensity. 



It was represented that the juncture had not apparently been 

 heated, at least not discoloured. This latter fact is perfectly con- 

 sistent, however, withsuch adegree of temperature as would allow 

 much mobility of particles, and greatly aid the high pressure of 

 more than a ton weight per square inch, and a strong magnetic 

 attraction to bring the revolving surfaces into the sphere of actual 

 cohesion. The grease box with which the two bars are stated to 

 have been surrounded would defend the surfaces from oxidation, 

 the cause of discolouring, and would interpose no effectual pre- 

 ventive against the contact of two plain surfaces, revolving in the 

 circumstances now supposed. 



Professor Johnson referred to his own experiments, made many 

 years ago, in which it was found that bars of ironbroken at atem- 

 perature of 5 or 600 degrees, and in the magnetic meridian, be- 

 came strongly and permanently magnetic. He referred to the 

 proceedings of the Academy (vol. 1, page 144,) for an account of 

 the phenomena then observed. 



It is a subject of regret that the proprietors of the mill in ques- 

 tion, had not preserved the united bars, to be submitted to compe- 

 tent persons for a minute examination of their condition and pro- 

 perties. 



Prof. Henry D. Rogers stated that the specimen of Oolite 

 rock presented by him this evening, had been obtained from 

 Dr. Binney of Boston. It had been found in Florida, in a 

 somewhat extensive deposit, by a correspondent of that gen- 

 tleman. Though identical in colour and structure with the

 refer it to the latest tertiary period.

Total length (of skin) 22 inches, bill 2|, wing 18, tail 8-|. 



Hah. — Near Vera Cruz. 



This species resembles C. aura, Linn., in the shape of the bill and nostrils, 

 and in having the tail rounded, but differs from it not only in size, but the 

 feathers extend upwards on the back of the neck and lie flat instead of form- 

 ing a ruff ; the plumage of the specimen now described is black, none of the 

 feathers having pale margins, as is commonly the case in specimens of C. 

 aura; the shafts of the primaries are clear white, and the head is more en- 

 tirely destitute of downy feathers. The tarsi are longer and more slender. 



The head of C. Burrovianus, is quite smooth, in which, as in other respects 

 it is very different from C. atratus, Wilson. 



This new species was obtained in the vincity of Vera Cruz, by the late 

 M. Burrough, M. D., in honor of whom I have named it, as a slight acknow- 

 ledgement for his very valuable services to Natural History and to this Aca- 

 demy.

 long, 3 1. wide. Pennsylvania. 



Black, shining: head deeply and rather distantly punctulate ; front and cly-

Rhipicerid^:, Latr. 

 Sandalus, Knoch. 



1. S. rubidus. Head and thorax brown or blackish; elytra fusco-rufous. 

 9 1. long ; 3| 1. wide. Pennsylvania. 



Densely rugose ; head and thorax black, minutely and confluently wrinkled 

 and punctured, densely clothed with yellowish pile, the latter with an obtuse 

 indentation on the middle of the anterior margin, and an obsolete one in front 

 of the scutel; between the two indentations is a faint medial line; lamellae of 

 the antennae dusky rufous ; elytra dusky rufous, finely and densely wrinkled ; 

 the three ordinary raised lines not strongly defined : beneath and feet black ; 

 postpectus densely clothed with yellowish hairs. This species bears a very 

 strong resemblance to S. niger, Kn., but it differs from that species in being 

 always more robust, and in having the elytra differently colored, and always 

 differently and more obsoletely sculptured. The elytra are scarcely punctured 

 in rubidus, but in niger they are obviously and profoundly punctured. But 

 as only male specimens of rubidus have yet been found, it may still prove to 

 be only a male variety of niger. Is not rubidus perhaps Rhipicera rujipennis 

 of Dejean's Catalogue 1 



2. S. brevicollis. Black, punctured ; thorax short and round at the sides. 

 6 I. long; 2f I. wide. Pennsylvania. 



Robust, oblong, black ; head opake, densely and finely rugose-punctured, 

 with the frontal lateral edges more than usually elevated above the insertion of 

 the antennae : thorax more than twice shorter than long, wider at base than 

 at apex, widest behind the middle, with the sides rounded ; densely and 

 minutely punctured and wrinkled, densely clothed with an ashy pubescence; 

 a large triangular indentation on the middle of the anterior margin, and a 

 similar but less profoundly indented one in front of the scutel ; medial groove 

 distinct between the two indentations : elytra opake, with the ordinary lines 

 distinct, spaces with irregular series of large, profound and approximate punc- 

 tures; vesture indistinct : beneath and feet black, finely and densely punctured, 

 and clothed as above ; tarsi piceous. Resembles in the thorax S. pelrophya, 

 Kn., but in the general color and outlines and sculpture of the elytra it differs 

 essentially from the same. 



Cebrionidx, Latr. 

 Atop a, Fabr. 

 1. A. ornata. Black; thorax rosaceous, with two large black spots ; each

elytrum with two or three ashy vittce. 3 — 4£ 1. long; 1 — 1£ !. wide. Penn- 

 sylvania. 



Black, densely clothed with a fine, short pile : head finely and densely sha- 

 greened ; clypeus truncate at apex ; labrum narrow, transverse ; palpi fili- 

 form, terminal joint acuts at tip ; antennas inserted before the eyes, nearly half 

 the length of the body, fuscous, pubescent, sometimes the two first joints dull 

 testaceous, joints compressed, basal joint clavate, second small, subglobose, 

 third and fourth almost equal, the former very slightly longer than the latter : 

 thorax convex, comparatively narrower before and wider behind than in cervina, 

 Fabr., dull rosaceous, with a large suboval black spot each side of the middle; 

 medial line obsolete, with a small impression in front of the scutel, which is 

 suborbiculate or cordate, color of the thorax : elytra slightly convex, feebly 

 contracted behind the shoulders; punctate-striate, interstices flat, confluently 

 and minutely transversely corrugated; lateral edges, suture, and two or three 

 longitudinal bands, ashy, they are somewhat obsolete except when viewed in a 

 lateral oblique direction : feet and beneath, dull blackish, ashy sericeous; tarsi 

 almost simple, basal joint subclavate, the three following ones slightly dilated, 

 hardly cordate; claws very minutely ciliated or pectinated. In consequence of 

 the second and third antennal joints of this coleoptera being almost equal, and 

 the tarsal joints simple and not cordate, it cannot strictly be placed in the genus 

 Atopa, but it certainly approaches, in other characters, nearer to it than to any 

 other genus. This species feeds exclusively on the Alder.

 sylvania. 



Drilus bicolor, Melsh. MS. 



Black above, or pitchy glossy ; head shining, very minutely punctured ; eyes 

 black ; antennas rufo-testaceous, with the second joint small, subobconic, third

Dr. Morton then proceeded to make some observations on 

 the three human crania deposited by him this evening, but 

 more particularly in reference to that of the Congo negro, 

 which was presented to him by Dr. David Gilbert, of Get- 

 tysburg, in this State. 



This skull pertained to an individual who could not have been 

 more than twenty years old ; and yet there is a total absence of 

 the sagittal and coronal sutures, and the lamdoidal itself is not 

 complete, while the temporal suture remains entirely open. 

 Dr. Morton called the attention of the society to a communication 

 made by him in 1841, on a skull in nearly all respects analogous 

 to the present one, and the opinion then deduced from it, viz.: 

 that the principal function of the sutures is to subserve the growth 

 of bones, which they do by osseous deposition at their margins; 




May, 1845.] 233 



hence a suture in the cranium is equivalent to the epiphysis be- 

 tween the shaft and head of any one of the long bones.* In the 

 present example, Dr. Morton showed that owing to the total ab- 

 sence of the sagittal suture, the lateral growth of the cranium has 

 ceased at an early period of life ; the presence of the lamdoidal 

 suture has permitted of posterior elongation, and the squamous 

 sutures being entirely open, the upward growth, corresponding to 

 the lines of these sutures, is remarkably developed. 



Dr. Morton expressed his acknowledgments to the Baron Von 

 Gerolt, Prussian Minister at Washington, for the ancient Mexican 

 cranium deposited this evening. It was exhumed from the ce- 

 metery of San Juan de Tlatilolco, near the city of Mexico, in 

 which were buried great numbers of the Mexicans who were 

 slain in defence of their city against the Spaniards, during the in- 

 vasion of Cortez.

May, 1845.] 235 



To Professor Henry D. Rogers, Samuel George Morton, M. D., and Pro- 

 fessor Waller R. Johnson, Committee of Ike Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia. 



Gentlemen, — A plain statement of such facts as I have been able to collect 

 in reference to the Geological character of the country bordering on the Mis- 

 souri River, will perhaps be preferable to attempting a detailed reply to the 

 questions proposed by your Committee to Mr. Audubon and myself on our de- 

 parture for the upper waters of the Missouri in the spring of 1843. I would 

 beg leave to remark that our opporlunitics for Geological research fell far short 

 of our anticipations. The extent of our journey was unexpectedly limited to 

 the mouth of the Yellowstone, and just before leaving that place, a diagram, 

 which I had found of the strata in the hills rising back of Fort Union, was un- 

 fortunately destroyed when too late to replace it. The specimens taken from 

 these strata will be found in the box which I have sent to the Academy. Our 

 opportunities in descending the river were also far from being favorable. Fre- 

 quent storms and high winds obliged us to lie by in places which we would not 

 have chosen for any of the purposes of the expedition, so that by taking advan- 

 tage of all the good weather to hasten our progress, we were only able to reach 

 St. Louis in our Mackinaw boat on the sixty-third day from Fort Union. 



In the whole course of the Missouri, from its mouth to the mouth of the Yel- 

 lowstone, the strata are horizontal, and as we passed up the River, I noted the 

 points at which each of the principal series was lost under the water by the 

 rise in the bed of the stream. Thus — the lower series of secondary limestone 

 disappears a few miles above Bellevue, and at Cabaue's Bluff, twenty miles fur- 

 ther, a ledge of rocks crosses the river beneath the water, causing a slight rapid 

 at a low stage water. I take this to be the last evidence of that formation. 

 From Cabaue's Bluff to the Grand Sioux River, a distance of about 160 miles 

 the River approaches the Bluffs in but few places, and in those places the rock, 

 of about 60 feet in thickness, appeared to be a soft sandstone. (In no part of 

 this formation had we an opportunity of landing to ascertain the nature of the 

 rock, still I thought we were near enough to pronounce it sandstone.) This 

 stratum loses itself in the River near the Grand Sioux. At this place a stratum 

 of soft clay stone appears, which runs to within a few miles of the lower end 

 of the Great Bend where there is another submerged ledge of rocks crossing the 

 River. Then we have Nicollet's great bed of clay which is visible until you 

 pass the Mandans, terminating between Beaver and Grand Rivers. Here com- 

 mences what 1 have called the Yellowstone series, which probably continues to 

 the great Falls of the Missouri, or until it is met by the outcropping rocks of the 

 mountain range, if these Falls be not formed by such outcropping. 



Thus we have in the ascending series — No. 1, The secondary limestone 

 from the first Bluffon the Mississippi, above the mouth of the Ohio, to Cabaue's 

 Bluff on the Missouri, ten or twelve miles below Old Council Bluffs. No. 8, 

 Yellow sandstone (?) to Grand Sioux River. No. 3, Clay stone to lower end 

 of Great Bend. No. 4, Nicollet's clay to a point between Beaver and Grand 

 Rivers. No. 5, The Yellow stone formation. It will be perceived that the loca- 




236 [May, 1845. 



lities named as the ending of one and beginning of another series, are not in 

 fact the beginning of the upper bed, but are the points where the superior stra- 

 tum of the last series is lost sight of in the River. Hence it is evident (from 

 the fact of the strata being perfectly horizontal) that while the lower series will 

 never be seen higher up the River than the points indicated, the superincumbent 

 series must have its beginning many miles lower down, according to the height 

 of the Bluffs and the angle of descent of the stream. 



Whenever we ascended the Bluffs to the High Prairies, we found them more 

 or less covered with a Boulder drift, with frequent denuded points, leaving the 

 larger Boulders lying upon the regular strata. As we ascended the River, the 

 Boulders, which are much worn and rounded, increased in size (with some vari- 

 ations) until we reached the high hills of the second Great Bend, between the 

 Mandans and the mouth of the Yellowstone, say, from the size of paving stones 

 at Fort Croghan to rocks of several tons at the second Great Bend, after which, 

 and at the Yellowstone, half a ton would probably be the size of the largest 

 Boulder. 



The exceptions to perfectly horizontal stratification are only found in series 

 No. 4, and appear to have arisen from two causes — from slides of the Bluffs, 

 and from the fact of their frequently taking fire and burning for several years, 

 causing the Bluffs to sink and crumble down. Mr. Bel) was the only one of 

 our party who had an opportunity of witnessing the burning of the cliffs, while 

 on a hunting excursion about 30 miles above the Yellowstone on the northern 

 bank of the Missouri. Smoke was issuing from the summit of the cliffs under 

 which he was riding — there was a thin seam of coal on a line with the smoking 

 part of the cliff, but where it was burning, and where the fire appeared (by the 

 crumbling down of the cliff) to have passed, there was no coal visible. I am 

 inclined, from this circumstance, and from having found remains of coal in a 

 stratum of sandstone containing impressions of leaves, and bearing evident 

 marks of fire, to think with Lewis and Clark, that the burning of the cliffs is to 

 be attributed to the spontaneous ignition of the coal. The soil in No. 4 and 5 is 

 strongly impregnated with salts, apparently sulphate of magnesia (7) so that 

 most of the brooks and springs are saliferous. In excursions on the Prairies it 

 is difficult to find good water. Soon after rains it may be found in small basins, 

 but these soon become brackish, unless they are in the detritus of the drift. 



Series Nos. 3 and 4 appear to contain the greatest quantity of crystallized salts, 

 such as alum, copperas and sulphate of magnesia, and saliferous springs and 

 streams in great numbers. Warm springs are said to exist, but we did not meet 

 with them. We found a substance like petrolium in colour and consistence, but 

 without odour. Crystallized gypsum (1 see specimens) is exceedingly abundant 

 in No. 4, lying in thin veins, cutting the regular stratification at right angles, 

 Fossil shells abounded most in No. 4. 



In No. 5. commence the remarkable strata which form the picturesque hills 

 noticed by travellers, and called the Mauvaises Terres by the trappers and voy- 

 ageurs. The strata vary from a few inches to a few feet in depth, and from the 

 variety of their colours, and from the singular forms and grouping of the hills 

 into which the great Bluff of the high Prairie is gullied by the torrents of ages,

they appear in many places more like the work of art than nature. They are 

 usually called Clay hills by travellers, but repeated inspection has satisfied me 

 that clay occcupies but a small number of the strata, at least in the vicinity of 

 Fort Union. There are strata of sand, clay, shale, sandstone and coal alternat- 

 ing, but without regularity. I have frequently seen a stratum of sand com- 

 pletely covered by the washing from a superincumbent stratum of clay, like a 

 coat of paint, so that its nature could only be ascertained by scraping off the 

 thin covering of clay. I am inclined to think, however, that the proportion of 

 clay is greater in the lower strata of this series, immediately overlying the Nicol- 

 let clay. The cause of the singular castellated appearance of these hills is the 

 great variety of materials of which the strata are composed being acted upon in 

 various degrees by atmospherical influences, according to their capability of re- 

 sisting them ; hence the spires, pyramids, cones and other forms cut out by the 

 torrents, are frequently capped by hard sandstone, while the stratum, immediately 

 underlying it, may be sand or clay, which being more easily affected by the 

 atmosphere, crumbles away and leaves the sandstone projecting, and so on with 

 thirty or forty distinct strata of hard and soft sandstone, sand, clay, shale and 

 coal, of very marked shades of colour, and in many places reddened by the 

 action of fire. I should have remarked that the visible coal seams which com- 

 mence in the upper part of No. 4, are most abundant soon after entering into 

 No. 5, and become small and few in number about the Yellowstone. I counted 

 in one place eight seams of coal between the river bank and the top of the Bluff, 

 varying from six inches to four feet in thickness. This coal is very light, and 

 ignites with difficulty, emitting a very unpleasant odour while burning. Fossil- 

 ized wood is very abundant in No. 5 ; I saw one specimen very much flattened 

 by the pressure of overlying strata. Small beds of limestone are found at Fort 

 Union. 



In regard to the evidences of volcanic matter overlving the stratified rocks on 

 the borders of the Missouri, and of the existence of red pumice in such situa- 

 tions, I have no where been able to discover them, although I sought them dili- 

 gently in my frequent excursions into the Mauvaises Terrcs. The red appear- 

 ance of the shale and clay, and in many instances of the sandstone, is, I believe, 

 to be attributed to the action of fire, but may be more readily accounted for 

 from the effects of the spontaneous combustion of the coal going on at the pre- 

 sent day, than from volcanic agency. These evidences of fire occur in so many 

 of the strata at such different levels, that to give them the latter origin we are 

 compelled to suppose a succession of eruptions, but in this case what has become 

 of the tuffa and lava! It is impossible that I could have failed in discovering 

 some evidence of their existence. Still I do not pretend to deny that the pumice 

 which is so frequently found floated down the Missouri, may have had its origin 

 in these hills and may have been found there by Mr. Catlin ; (I do deny that it 

 is the cause of the red appearance of the hills) but may it not be accounted for 

 by the action of these spontaneous fires 1 May nut pumice be found without 

 volcanic action ? Some of the specimens of sandstone with impressions of 

 leaves, in the box sent to the Academy, are evidently changed in their specific 

 gravity by the action of fire, and your Committee will be better able than my- 




23S [Mar, 1845. 



self to judge, whether an increase of the heat, short of that necessary to produce 

 vitrification, may not have converted the mass into the red pumice of the 

 Missouri. 



In a bed of soft sandstone at the mouth of Cannon Ball River, great numbers 

 of those singular stones are found, which give name to the stream. The fol- 

 lowing remarks from my Journal, made on the passage up the River, were 

 fully confirmed when we stopped at the mouth of Cannon Ball River on our 

 return. " June 6 — On passsing the mouth of Cannon Ball River yesterday, we 

 noticed a remarkable formation in this stratum" (soft sandstone) « of round 

 masses of rock" (Hard sandstone) " in the divisions of the strata, many of them 

 apparently perfectly spherical, and from 18 to 30 inches in diameter, some as 

 perfect as cast balls, others appear to be flattened or composed of two sections of 

 a sphere, from a smaller ace up to a hemisphere, joined together with mathema- 

 tical nicety, and surrounded by a belt or zone at the junction projecting from 

 one to four inches, which zone lies horizontally in the line of division of two 

 strata. I had observed traces of this peculiarity in the rock the day before, and 

 this evening, 30 miles below the Mandans, I noticed it again. Cannon Ball 

 River takes its name from the presence of these balls. They are said to be 

 hollow, and to contain crystals." The last remark was not confirmed by the 

 opening of two large specimens brought home by Mr. Audubon, which were 

 found to be solid and of uniform texture throughout. 



A somewhat analogous formation occurs in the region of the Yellowstone. 

 It consists of a similar hard sandstone, lying also in the divisions of the strata 

 of soft sandstone, but in form like a flattened trunk of a tree swelling out at the 

 root, and might be taken for fossilized wood, but that it is destitute of concen- 

 tric rings, and laminae can always be traced in the direction of the longest dia- 

 meter of the elliptical end, sometimes in exact correspondence with, and in 

 other instances lying obliquely to, that diameter. I have seen them in situ 

 projecting ten feet horizontally and perpendicular to the face of the cliff. I 

 have seen others of more than twenty feet in length lying at the foot of the 

 cliff whence they had fallen. The smaller end always exhibits the appear- 

 ance of a transverse fracture with edges sharp and well defined, the larger 

 end rounded and resembling the head of an immense bone fitted to work in 

 a socket. 



If this meagre statement of facts and the few specimens which accompany 

 it, will serve in a small degree for the better appreciation of the Geologicial 

 character of this interesting region, and hold out any inducement to well qua- 

 lified persons to undertake its investigation, the object of the undersigned will 

 be accomplished. 



Yours Respectfully, 



Edward Harris. 




May, 1845.] 239 



The Committee to whom the above paper of Mr. Harris, 

 on certain points in the geology of the Upper Missouri, was 

 referred, having availed themselves of additional information 

 from that gentleman, and examined the specimens brought 

 home by him, submitted to the Academy the following facts 

 and inferences in the form of an appendix to his valuable 

 communication. 



Of the Red Pumice of the Missouri. 



Upon the question of the origin of this singular substance, the Committee 

 desire to express their general concurrence in the views presented in the paper 

 of Mr. Harris. From the evidence afforded by the series of specimens it is 

 clear that the so-called Pumice is not a true volcanic product, but is originally 

 an argillaceous sandstone, probably a lacustrine deposition of a tertiary age. 

 In its altered, cellular form, it is said to occur loose on the shore, throughout 

 nearly the whole length of the River, as if strewed by the freshets, its specific 

 gravity being frequently less than that of water. 



The locality, where it was seen in place, is between the Beaver and Grand 

 Rivers, above the Mandans, on the East side of the Missouri, and thereforeabout 

 200 miles below the mouth of the Yellowstone. Here the material offers the 

 most unequivocal marks of being derived from the spontaneous combustion of a 

 sedimentary argillo-arenaceous stratum. The rock is seen in almost every state 

 of gradation from a stratified mass containing beautifully distinct impressions 

 of leaves of terrestrial trees, to a light vesicular pumice. Certain half-fused 

 specimens show indeed the well presumed traces of these leaves, the partially 

 melted condition and the nearly perfect vesicular structure, all upon the same 

 mass. The presence of sulphuret of iron, and of lignite, in the neighboring clays 

 of the same group of strata, suggests a ready source for this spontaneous 

 combustion. 



This explanation of the origin of the pumice, sustained as it is by the draw- 

 ings and descriptions of the scenery given by the Prince Maximilian, and borne 

 out by the fact that no other material, of even an imputed volcanic source, has 

 ever been discovered in the plains of the Missouri, renders it highly probable 

 that the stratified pumice, alleged by Mr. Catlin to exist there, is derived from 

 the same cause. We therefore come to the general conclusion, which best 

 accords with all that is known of the topographical features of the region, that 

 no trace of volcanic action is visible East of the Rocky Mountains. 



The leaves imbedded in the stratum which produces the pumice-like material, 

 bear a near resemblance to those of the common beach tree, (Fagus ferruginea,) 

 they are at all events the leaves of an exogenous tree of a recent type. 



Proofs of a Freshwater formation, near the Mouth of the Yellowstone River. 



In the immediate vicinity of Fort Union, near the junction of the Yellow, 

 stone and Missouri Rivers, in the group of strata designated as No. 5 in Mr. 

 Harris's paper, occur incontestible proofs of a freshwater formation. At a dis- 



29 




240 [May, 1845. 



tance from the Fort of about half-a-mile, that gentleman had a view of the 

 horizontal outcrop of the lands of rock through a height of about 80 feet, com- 

 mencing 80 or 100 feet above the river, and terminating more than 100 feet be- 

 low the general level of the rolling plains, which are here nearly 300 above the 

 bed of the Missouri. The section which he constructed was subsequently lost. 

 It exhibited 15 different beds of alternating soft clays, uncemented sands, and 

 soft argillaceous sandstone. 



In the upper part of this section occurs lignite, some of which is in the con- 

 dition of a very friable charcoal. 



The fourth and fifth, layers in this section are especially interesting. The 

 4th is a bed of clay, the 5th a layer not more than one foot in thickness, of a 

 brown ferruginous argillaceous rock. They contain three or four species of 

 freshwater univalve shells, Lymnea, Planorbis, &c. One of the species of 

 Planorbis it is conjectured may be a form now extinct, but the mutilated con 

 dition of the specimens prohibits a positive opinion. 



Within one mile and-a-half of the locality of the section just alluded to, there 

 is a stratum of fine-grained argillaceous sandstone of a light-grey colour, with 

 minute black specks. This occupies a higher level than the top of the section. 

 The rock is exposed in a quarry through a thickness of 20 or 30 feet, whence 

 building stone has been procured for the foundations of the fort. Like the beds 

 previously described, this stratum furnishes proof of a freshwater origin. Among 

 the specimens from it, is one presenting the two valves of a bivalve shell, appa- 

 rently an Anadonta ? 



It also contains leaves of deciduous trees, bearing a close resemblance to those 

 of the Beach. Besides these indications we have evidences derived from the 

 remains of what was probably a mammiferous animal. Two fragments of bone 

 procured at one of the above localities, indicate by their cancellated structure an 

 animal of this type ; but they were too imperfect to enable us to decide the 

 order to which they belong. 



The proofs thus afforded of a probably widely diffused freshwater formation 

 in the region of the Upper Missouri, reposing upon the cretaceous strata, and 

 imbedding remains of a manifestly tertiary age, are just at this time invested 

 with considerable interest, from their according with the discoveries recently 

 made by Captain Freemont, of the presence of other and probably extensive 

 freshwater tertiary strata in the Oregon Territory. \ 



All which your Committee beg leave respectfully to Report.

This species resembles very much our C. punclalus, but wants the spots 

 upon the abdomen. The latter, however, are occasionally absent in the punc-

 possibly be the same species. It would appear to be common, four specimens 

 having been observed in the collection.

This species resembles very much the Trigonocephalus lanceolatus, Oppel. 

 or Vipere jaune of the French, but differs from it in its habitat, (the latter 

 being found in Martinique,) and in the number of its plates. In the lanceolatus 

 there are 225 to 228 plates upon the abdomen, and from 59 to 61 upon the 

 tail. 



Leiolefis Auduboni.

 teen or eighteen in number ; the rostral plate is pentagonal ; the frontal plates 

 are quadrangular; the nasal plates are large and pentagonal; the nostrils are 

 large and directed forwards ; there is a small quadrangular plate between the 

 nasal and the frontal plate ; there are five plates along the margin of the upper 

 jaw, they are oblong, quadrilateral; the eyes are oval; the eyelids are covered

 tion — in the back they are hexagonal and carinated, in the sides they are more 

 or less circular, with indistinct carinoe, in the abdomen they are quadrangular, 

 and strongly carinated ; the tail is more than twice the length of the body, it is 

 covered with carinated scales. 



Colour. — The head and upper parts of body are of a brownish chocolate 

 colour, variegated with spots of green and yellow ; tail chocolate colour ; under 

 surface of chin, throat, abdomen and extremities, straw colour, with numerous 

 dark coloured spots.

The specimens above described were found in the Kepublic of Columbia, 

 within two hundred miles of Caraccas. As far as I have been able to ascertain 

 they are new, with the exception of the Coluber atratus, and the Trigonoce- 

 phaly Colombiensis, both of which are somewhat doubtful ; the latter resem- 

 bles very much the plate of the lanceolutus, as given in the Regne Animal of 

 Cuvier, except that the triangular 'spots upon the sides meet upon the back, 

 whereas, in our specimens — of which there were two — they are distinct. It 

 differs from it also, as above stated, in the number of the abdominal and sub- 

 caudal plates. Among them was a specimen of the Ampleistana fuliginosa. 

 They were all preserved in spirits.

For the opportunity of describing this and the preceding species, I am in- 

 debted to the kindness of my friend Dr. Blanding, whose services in the 

 illustration of the Zoology of this country and of Africa are well known. 

 The specimens were preserved in spirits, and the colours have no doubt 

 more or less changed. Among them was a horned snake, which appears to 

 be the Coluber nasicornis of Shaw, but his description is imperfect, and his 

 figures incorrect ; I would propose for it the name of Arastes nasicornis.

This is a recent species obtained by the dredge at sea, in about

Description of the Teeth of a new Fossil Animal found in the Green Sand of 

 South Carolina. 



By Robert W. Gibbes, M. D., of Columbia, S. C. 



DoRUDON SERRATUS. 



Teeth spear-shaped, serrated, in distinct deep sockets with double- fangs, the 

 bifurcation commencing a half inch below the enamel, which extends from the 

 point of the tooth one inch ; enamel striated ; the serris longitudinal, diminish- 

 ing in size from the apex of the tooth, which is f of an inch from the first la- 

 teral point; length of the tooth 3^ inches; breadth 2| inches; thickness of the 

 body below the enamel a half inch ; the anterior root a cone compressed 

 laterally, the other prismalic, thicker on the posterior side, which is fluted 

 so as to present the appearance of being partially divided into two fangs. 

 Where the fangs are united the neck is contracted, so that a horizontal section 

 presents the yoke shape of the tooth of the Zeuglodon of Owen ; in one of the 

 teeth the distance from the extremities of the fangs across is 2^ inches. 



The teeth and fragments of a maxillary bone here described, were found in 

 March last, in a bed of Green sand near the Santee Canal, in South Carolina. 

 The locality is on the plantation of R, W. Mazyck, Esq., about three miles 

 from the entrance of the canal from the head waters of Cooper river. The de- 

 posite of Green sand is from four to eight feet thick near the surface, lying on a 

 solid yellowish limestone containing casts of Cardita Planicosta, (Sow.,) and 

 Pecten Mortoni, (Ravenel,) which, according to the opinions of Lyell and 

 Conrad, would refer it to the Eocene period. Casts of C. planicosta are found 

 in the Green sand, which seems, therefore, to belong to the Tertiary formation. 

 Conrati makes the following remarks, in his communication on "the Tertiary" 

 addressed to the National Institution. 



" In many localities of the former period (tertiary,) the green sand is quite 

 as abundant as in the fossiliferous < marls' of New Jersey." In this deposite is 

 found, in great abundance, Gryphoea mutabilis, also Pecten membranosus, 

 P. calvalus, Scutella crusluloides, S. Rogcrsii, Solarium ? Plagiostoma gre- 

 galc, Anomia jugosa, Teredo tibialis, Scalar ia Sillimani? Casts of a large 




June, 1S45.] 255 



Nautilus, probably Alabamiensis, (Morton,) vertebrae of Cetacca, Teeth of 

 Crocodiles, and of several species of Squulus ; casts of C. planicosta, and of a 

 Terebralula. Mr. Tuomey, the Geological Surveyor of South Carolina, found 

 also, at this locality, a new Ostrea and a large Lima. Here also was found a 

 singular fossil, of a conical shape, 15 inches long, fluted externally, somewhat 

 resembling # a Belemnite, of which a drawing and description have been for- 

 warded to the Academy of Natural Sciences by Dr. E. Kavenel, of Charleston, 

 South Carolina. 



About two miles from this locality a very compact white limestone is found, 

 with grains of silicate of iron intermingled with portions of it, containing 

 Ostrea selloeformis, 0. panda, Terebralula lacryma, Scutella crustuloides, 

 casts of Turritella Mortoni, Conus gyratus, Anthophyllum atlanticum, F lus- 

 tra? casts of the Chambers of a Nautilus, Crustacea, a Sputangus, Ciduris? 

 &c. &c. Here also Mr. Tuomey has discovered another new Ostrea. This 

 list of fossils is made out from recollection, and without the specimens before 

 me. 



With these teeth I have a part of a lower maxilla, containing portions of 

 teeth, 20 inches in length, hollow, filled with the green sand. It re- 

 sembles much the elongated beak of the Gavial, but is too imperfect to describe 

 more accurately. 



A portion of the anterior part of this jaw contains a cuspidatus, resembling 

 that of the Megalosaurus, a single fang, with the protruding crown and point 

 curved but not serrated ; it is compressed laterally, and placed obliquely in a 

 socket. 



These teeth are all hollow, filled with the green sand which surrounds them. 

 They differ materially from any genus or species described by Cuvier, Owen, 

 Mantele, Bucklasd, Haulan, Morton, or Hays. A strong resemblance 

 exists, in the form of the elongated snout, to the Gavials, while the hollow 

 teeth, characteristic of Saurians, differ from them in being seated in sockets, 

 and having two roots. 



Mantell, treating of the teeth of Reptiles, says : 



" The characteristic type is that of a conical pointed tooth with a simple root 

 or fang ; for in no reptile does the base of the tooth terminate in more than one 

 fang, and this is never branched." 



Owen, in his Odontography, (p. 25.) observes : 



" Any fossil which exhibits a tooth implanted by two fangs in a double 

 socket must be mammiferous, since the socketed teeth of reptiles have but a 

 single fang, and the only fishes' teeth which approach such a tooth are those 

 with a bifurcate base belonging to certain sharks." 



I observe that Professor Owen has classed the Zeuglodon (Basilosaurus of 

 Harlan,) with the Cetacea. I am inclined to think the Dorudon, which I here 

 name, (from 5opi;> a spear,) will, on farther investigation, be found to belong 

 to the same class. 



I visited the locality where it was found, but the marling operations of the 

 planters had ceased for the season, and the pits were filled with water. I have 

 made arrangements for excavations in the fall, when I hope to procure other 

 bones of this remarkable fossil. It may then be possible to decide with more 

 authority as to its position in the great scale of extinct gigantic carnivora. 



30 




256 [June, 1S45 



Since the above communication was written, I have visited Albany, and 

 through the politeness of Professor Emmons, had an opportunity of examining 

 the teeth of the Zeuglodon cetoides, (Owen.) I was much struck with the 

 similarity in their general characters with those of the Dorudon. They are 

 very much of the same form, but the crown rounded instead of hastate — the 

 serratures are similar, though more crenate. The fangs of some are inserted 

 almost perpendicularly, while in others they are divergent, and fixed in the 

 sockets as in the Dorudon. The teeth of the Zeuglodon are solid, of dense 

 structure, and very strong, resembling those of Cetacea, while the hollowness of 

 those of the Dorudon approximate it to the Saurians. The jaw of the Zeuglo- 

 don is much shorter, and proportionally thicker. The conformation being 

 similar, while the specific characters of these teeth separate them, I am disposed 

 to think that the Dorudon is an intermediate connecting link between these 

 two great classes. 



Professor Emmons is about to publish correct drawings of the teeth of the 

 Zeuglodon, which Professor Owen has not given, from having imperfect speci- 

 mens.

Mr. Cassin, from the Curators, announced that the splendid 

 collection of European fossils, belonging to Mr. R. C. Taylor, 




Aug, 1845.] 261 



which the Society, by a late resolution, had authorized them 

 to receive on deposit, was now in the Hall. 



The Chairman, after making some general remarks on Mr. 

 Taylor's cabinet of fossils deposited this evening, read the follow- 

 ing abstract of its contents, from a printed circular, which was 

 issued by Mr. Taylor, and which will serve to convey some idea 

 of their extent and value. 



The collection is designed to illustrate the principal English 

 formations. The specimens were selected by Mr. Taylor with great 

 care from their respective localities, during a period of 25 years, 

 commencing in 1805; and although since they have subsequently 

 been subjected to frequent removals from place to place, &c, very 

 few have sustained injury. The greater portion is fixed on 

 blocks covered with paper of different colors. Labels attached 

 to the foot of each block, exhibit the generic and specific name 

 of each fossil, arranged according to Sowerby's Mineral Conch- 

 ology, and referring to the tables or figures in that work. 



In Geological arrangement, the collection commences with the 

 English Diluvium, so called, and proceeds downwards, by sec- 

 tions, from the most recent deposit to the oldest which contains 

 organic remains. In conchological classification, the Univalves, 

 Bivalves, and compound shells, are separated in distinct drawers, 

 and reference to any individual or species is further facilitated 

 under this arrangement, by an alphabetical nomenclature. 



The collection has been repeatedly subjected to examination 

 by English Professors and Naturalists of celebrity, and their aid 

 obtained in doubtful cases. 



The entire number now contained in the collection, amounts

Descriptions of new and little known Birds, collected in Upper California.^ 



By William Gambel. 



Family LEPTOSTOMID^E. 



Bill longer than the head, straight except towards the tip; wings short, 

 rounded ; tail long, cuneated ; feet with two toes before and two behind ; tarsus 

 long and stout. 



Genus Leptostoma, Swains. 



Bill long, stout, entire; straight, except at tip which is hooked ; triangular at 

 base, compressed towards the tip. Nostrils lateral, naked, oblong. A wide 

 bare space extending from the eye to the nape. Wings very short, rounded. 

 Tail very long, cuneated. Feathers around the base of the bill rigid, the shafts 

 elongated into black setaceous hairs ; the upper eyelid also with a row of very 

 rigid hairs. Feathers of the body very long and woolly ; those of the breast, 

 shoulders, wings and tail beautifully variegated, and with long ciliated edging. 

 Tarsus very long and stout, crested. 



Leptostoma longicauda, Swainson, 1824, in catalogue of birds of Mexican 

 Museum, and in description of the genus in Natural History of Birds, vol. 2, 

 p. 325. Savrotrkra californica? Lesson ; S. Bottse? Blainville. Geococcyx 

 vialicus ? Wagler, Lichtenstein. 



Male. — Variegated ; feathers of the back part of the head erectile into a crest 

 one and a quarter inches in height, which is steel blue with purplish reflections. 

 Upper part of back and wings, upper tail coverts and two middle tail feathers, 

 brownish green with bronze reflections, those of the former with steel-blue, 

 ochraceous, and white ciliated edgings ; those of the latter principally with 

 white. Front of the head, sides of neck and breast, with the centres of the 

 feathers still blue, broadly margined with ochraceous and white. Tail cuneated, 

 of ten feathers, and nearly twelve inches in length, the two outer ones about 

 three inches shorter than the two middle ones, and all except these latter bluish- 

 green, narrowly edged and tipped with white. Body covered with very long 

 silky or woolly feathers ; above of a blackish gray colour, below of a grayish 

 white, with a tinge of yellowish-brown, particularly about the thighs and vent. 

 A bare space extending from the eye to the back of the head on each side, 

 where it opens out into a round patch of a Vermillion colour. Wings very 

 much rounded, first quill two-thirds the length of the fourth to the tenth, which 

 are nearly equal, the rest of the secondaries scarcely shorter. Primaries and 



tA former paper containing descriplions of some new Californian birds, was pub- 

 lished during my absence, in the Proceedings of this Society for March and April, 1843 . 




264 [Aug., 1845. 



secondaries dark brown, edged with white at their tips, and with a band of nar- 

 row white spots on their outer margin some distance above their tips. Throat 

 greyish-white, with a dusky line on each side. Bill dark horn colour. Feet 

 and legs very stout, the former beneath very scabrous. Tarsus bluish-white. 



Length 21^ inches. Tail nearly 12, tarsus 2|, longest toe and nail 1|. Bill 

 along the ridge nearly 2 inches, depth at base | an inch. Wing from flexure 

 about 7 inches. 



This extraordinary' bird, evidently the connecting linkbetween the scansorial 

 and rasorial orders of birds, was first noticed by Swainson, from a specimen 

 brought from Mexico by Mr. Bullock ; and who gave it the above name, though 

 for many years it remained undescribed in the collection of the Zoological So- 

 ciety from not being able to get access to it. In the Natural History of Birds, 

 Mr. Swainson describes the genus and gives also the specific name by which he 

 had distinguished it in 1824 in the catalogue of Bullock's Museum. It was 

 afterwards perhaps described by French as Saurothera Bottse, Blainville; and 

 S. Californiana, Lesson; but if they mean the same bird, the description is so 

 inaccurate as to be scarcely recognizable, the locality alone making us suppose 

 it to be the same. 



It is found in all the northern provinces of Mexico, where it is called Paisano. 

 In California it is not uncommon, and called in some parts of it Churea, and in 

 others Correcamino, the astonishing swiftness with which it runs making it well 

 known wherever it inhabits. 



Family PROMEROPID^E. 

 Genus, *Harfes.-j- 

 Bill longer than the head, arched from base, depressed ; upper mandible broad 

 and flattened with the margins very sharp ; lower, narrower and somewhat 

 shorter. Nostrils basal, open, rounded. A tuft of hairs at base of upper man- 

 dible. Wings short and much rounded. Tail long, cuneated. Feet and legs 

 long and stout. Tongue short and flat. Colours. plain. 



Harpes *rediviva. Promerops de la Californie Septentrionale, La Perouse, 

 Atlas to voyages, plate No. 37. 



Glossy brown above ; beneath from lower part of breast ochraceous, approach 

 ing to rufous on the vent and lower tail coverts. Throat greyish white, lower 

 part of neck, breast and sides brownish, somewhat lighter than that of the back. 

 A dusky line runs along the side of the throat from base of lower mandible. 

 Ears large and open, auriculars loose and somewhat rigid, the shafts white, 

 with the sparse hairy webs dusky. A dirty white line over the eye. Tail h\ 

 inches in length, cuneiform ; beneath tinged with the fulvous colour of belly, 

 and with traces of narrow dusky bars throughout its whole extent ; two outer 

 feathers about an inch shorter than middle ones. 



Wings short and rounded; extent of both 12 | inches,each from flexure 4 inches. 

 1st primary about half the length of the 3d, which is shorter than 7th, 8th and 

 9th ; 4th, 5th and 6th equal and longest. Tarsus 1 1 inches ; hind toe and nail, 

 which is curved, 1 inch, the nail being about as long as the toe. Total length 



-{-From 'ApTtrj, a sickle, hook or bill. 




Aug., 1845.] 265 



12 inches. Bill black, along ridge 1 and 5-8th inches, inner surface of upper 

 mandible almost flat, the edges sharp and projecting; each mandible triagonal ; 

 the lower narrower than the upper. Eyes projecting. Irids hazel. 



This curious bird was first seen by the naturalists in La Perouse's expedition, 

 as he tells us, who considered it a Promerops; and he merely remarks on it, 

 " we killed and prepared a Promerops which most ornithologists believe pe- 

 culiar to the ancient continent, "and gives no further description of it. 



The figure given in plate No. 37 of the Atlas is very inacccurate in every 

 respect, except as regards size; the tail of the bird is not so graduated and tipped 

 as in the figure, and although the breast alone is showed, the broad pectoral 

 band and white throat is not given : the black line over the eye also is incorrect ; 

 however, it is nearly as good as the figure of the Californian Quail. 



No further account of this bird (as far as I can learn) has been given since 

 the time of La Perouse until now, and it is rather singular that so many travel- 

 lers should have passed through the country it inhabits without finding it, from 

 which I infer its rarity even there. Both specimens which I have seen were 

 shot on the ground, near Monterey, in Upper California. 



Veillot and Lotham also mention this bird, merely quoting La Perouse's 

 words, of course giving neither name or description. 



Parus, Linn. 



Par*7s *inornatus. Male. — Crested: above olive brown; beneath greyish white, 

 with a slight tinge of brownish on the flanks. Front close to bill, round the eye and 

 ears grizzled grey. Crest high and pointed like that of the P. bicolur. Bill and 

 feet leaden-blue, the former very stout and blunt. Wings and tail dark-brown, 

 the feathers edged with the same colour as the back; some of the primaries also 

 with a faint edging of whitish. Irids wood-brown. 1st primary half the length 

 of the 2d ; 4th 5th and 6th equal. Extent of wings a little over 8 inches. 

 Wing from flexure 2f inches. Tail nearly even 2 \ inches. Total length 5§ 

 inches. 



Upper California, common — frequenting the evergreen oaks in company with 

 the other western species. 



Parus *fasciatus. Male. — Feathers of the head elongated, erectile into a crest; 

 head greyish brown, inclining to bluish grey on the cheeks and sides of the neck. 

 Back, rump, margins of wing and tail feathers olive brown. Beneath pale rufous, 

 slightly mingled with bluish grey about the throat and breast, and with brownish 

 about the flanks and vent. Wings and tail dusky brown, the latter distinctly 

 barred throughout with a darker colour, having from 20 to 25 bars, the quill 

 feathers also barred in the same manner on their inner webs. Bill and feet 

 dark horn colour. Feathers between nostrils and eye whitish. Wings short 

 and rounded. 1st quill an inch shorter than 5th, 6th and 7th, which are longest 

 3d shorter than 9th to 12th, from flexure 2f inches. Tail very long, cuneated. 

 3$ inches in length, two outer feathers 1£ inches shorter than middle ones, 

 Tarsus long and slender, 1 inch. Total length about 5 inches, extent of wings 

 the same. 



This very distinct species, after having once discovered, I found to be quite 



32 




266 [Aug., 1845 



common in California, frequenting the bushy margins of streams and weedy 

 places, with the intermediate habits of a titmouse and wren ; both of which in 

 some respects it resembles. For the present I place it in the Genus Parus, but 

 think its bill and other peculiarities render it worthy of being separated from it. 

 The bars on the tail and wings in some specimens are more indistinct than in 

 others. 



Meiigulus, Ray. 



Mergtjlus, * Cassinii.\ Head, back, wings and tail deep glossy black ; breast, 

 belly, vent, spot above and below the eyelids white ; throat, neck and sides greyish 

 black or plumbeous, the feathers of the scapulars, lower part of back and rump 

 tinged with the same. Bill larger and stouter than that of the M. alle, and with a 

 yellowish white spot or band across the base of lower mandible ; wings without 

 any white in them. Front part of feet and legs sky-blue, behind black. 



Length to end of tail 7| inches. Tarsus 1 inch. Bill nearly f of an inch. 



This new species frequent along the coast of California; may readily be dis- 

 tinguished from the M. alle, which it resembles, by the absence of any white in 

 the wing; the size of the bill; and as it turns in the dried specimen, the orange 

 spot at base of lower mandible ; and by the sides being coloured like the throat. 



Further notices of the character and habits of these birds I hope to give in a 

 future paper, containing a list, with remarks on the birds which I observed in 

 Upper California.

Tachxwus, Gravenh. 



T. puncticollis. Chestnut-brown ; thorax with two punctiform impressions 

 on the middle near the basal margin; elytra yellowish-testaceous. Length 4 

 lines ; breadth If lines.

 maining joints fuscous, excepting the terminal one which is dull-yellowish at 

 tip. Clypeus and palpi rufo-testaceous. Labrurn pale yellowish. Thorax, at 

 base slightly narrower than the base of the elytra, transverse, base subrectilinear, 

 sides rounded and marginate, angles obtusely rounded, anterior ones deflexed; 

 two punctiform impressions on the middle near the basal margin, between 

 which is an abbreviated longitudinal impressed line; dark chestnut-brown;

 Elytra punctured ; yellowish-testaceous, with the lateral edges and suture pos- 

 teriorly, and the apical margin dusky. Pectus and feet, dull yellowish-rufous. 

 Abdomen punctured, dark chestnut-brown. Inhabits Pennsylvania. 



Somewhat like T. crassus, Gravenh., but differs in the punctiform impressions 

 of the thorax, in being much wider in proportion to its length, and in its deptk 

 of colouring; in the present species the body is chestnut-brown, whereas in 

 crassus it strongly inclines to black. Can it be a variety of that species ! 



Phcexops, Megerle. 



P. luteosignata. Blackish ; elytra each with three yellowish or ferruginous 

 spots. Length 5^ lines; breadth 2^ lines. 



Phoenops luteosignata, Dej. Catal. 



Head coarsely punctured ; a shallow, longitudinal indentation on the front. 

 Antenna bluish-black. Thorax numerously punctured each side, punctures 

 very much dilated, and sometimes confluent ; on the disk, the punctures are less 

 obvious, presenting rather a corrugated appearance ; a broad, shallow indentation 

 each side behind the middle, converging posteriorly near the basal margin, and 

 a large profound punctiform impression before the scutel. Elytra black, with a 

 bluish tinge, granulated ; a dull yellowish or ferruginous spot arising near the

 dentation before the scutel, and another near the anterior margin, on each side 

 of which is a slight circular impression; lateral indentations profoundly im- 

 pressed. Scutel blackish-green. Elytra violaceous, finely granulated. In the 

 cabinet of Prof. Haldeman. Inhabits Georgia.

Dr. Morton offered some remarks on the skulls deposited 

 by him this evening. 



1. The four embalmed heads were brought from the Egyptian 

 catacombs, by Dr. C. Pickering. Two present all the character- 

 istics of the Negroid variety, or that in which the negro conformation 

 predominates ; the hair, especially in one of them, is long, but 

 harsh and somewhat wiry ; in the other it is cut short and presents 

 a finer texture. 



A third head of this series also exhibits some mixture of the 

 Negro race, but the little hair that remains is remarkably fine. 



The fourth has lost the facial bones, and is therefore not capable 

 of being precisely determined; but judging from the cranium,' it is 

 of Caucasian origin, and the hair, which is short and curly, is of a 

 very fine texture. 



2. The two ancient Peruvian heads possess great interest. They 

 were obtained by Dr. John Houstoun, an intelligent officer of the 

 British Navy, who politely sent them to Dr. Morton, with the fol- 

 lowing memorandum: "From an ancient Indian town called 

 Chiuchiu, or Atacama Baja, on the river Loa, eight leagues from 

 Calamo, and on the western edge of the desert of Atacama. Here 

 there are extensive remains of Indian houses, and a loop-holed 

 fortress built of mud. The huacha, or native burial place, is in a 

 terrace of soft sandstone, or volcanic tuffa. The bodies are nearly 

 all buried in the sitting posture, with the hands either placed on 

 each side of the head, or crossed over the breast." These crania 

 have been moulded by an artificial process into the upwardly- 

 elongated or sugar loaf form, being thus very high and broad in 

 front, with a short antero-posterior diameter, both the forehead and 

 occiput bearing evidences of long-continued compression. These 

 heads correspond precisely with the descriptions given by the 

 earliest Spanish travellers in Peru, and especially by Cieza and 

 Torquemada, who saw the natives in various parts of the country 

 with heads moulded precisely in this manner;* which was also 

 once in use among the Natchez tribes of the lower Mississippi, and 

 in various parts of Mexico. 



3. Two admirably characterized Indian crania, from ancient 

 cemeteries in Missouri, whence they were obtained by a zealous

inquirer into American Ethnography, — Dr. Wistlenius, of St. Louis. 

 Dr. Morton expressed his regret that the very interesting letter of 

 that gentleman to him had been inadvertently mislaid; but he in- 

 tends to communicate it to the Society as soon as recovered. 



4. Two skulls of native Africans, the one a Hottentot, the other 

 a Mozambique. The first of these is the head of a woman, of 

 perhaps five and twenty. It is small in si^e, with all the strongly 

 marked negro features which are characteristic of these singular 

 people. For these crania, Dr. Morton expressed his acknowledg- 

 ments to Mr. John Watson, of (Jape Town, through his brother, Dr. 

 Gavin Watson, of our Institution.

Dr. Leidy read the following notes on White Pond, 

 Warren Co., New Jersey: 



Notes taken on a visit toWhite Pond, in Warren Co., New Jersey. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 



In the course of a pedestrian tour, during the latter part of the 

 last summer, accompanied by R. H. Kern, Esq., an artist of this 

 city, while in the northern part of New Jersey, I visited White 

 Pond, in Warren Co. This pond or lake is situated one mile north 

 of the village of Marksboro, is about one mile in circumference, and 




280 {Oct., 1845- 



received its name from its remarkable appearance, arising from its 

 bed being a deposit of a kind of white shell marl. At a short dis- 

 tance it has quite a wintry aspect, the shore appearing as if covered 

 with snow. On near approach, the ordinary observer will be much 

 astonished, and the naturalist much interested in finding a vast 

 quantity of comparatively recent fossil fresh water shells, which not 

 only cover, but in many places appear to form the shore, extending 

 in breadth and depth for several feet. If a bunch of the Helianthe- 

 mum corymbosum, which grows here profusely, be pulled up, 

 nothing but shells and their fragments will be found adhering to its 

 roots. These shells are evidently washed from the deposit of marl 

 in the bed of the pond, as the neighboring inhabitants state that 

 the shores receive an accession of them every spring. 



With the exception of a small species of Cyclas and some frag- 

 ments of Unios, the shells are all univalve, and most of them are of 

 the same genera and species as those found in our fresh water, of 

 the present time, a few being extinct. Many of them have ad- 

 hering to their inside some root-like fibres, which upon examination 

 I find to be a species of Chara. 



It was a matter of much surprise to me that I could not find a 

 single living molluscous animal in the pond, and a neighbor in- 

 formed me " no snails had ever been found, and only a very few 

 muscles with flesh in," in it. 



The pond is in a limestone region ; its water, from its situation, 

 is necessarily calcareous, but probably at some anterior period of 

 time was much more so, was much more affected by the internal 

 temperature of the earth than at the present time, and then teemed 

 with the animals whose testaceous coverings form the deposit of 

 marl. 



It is very evident that the deposit of shell marl belongs to the 

 newer Pliocene of some, or tertiary period of other geologists, from 

 the fact of the existence among the shells of the Limneus Galbanus 

 in considerable numbers, which is an extinct species, the abundance 

 of other species now comparatively rare, and the absence of others 

 now common ; as for instance, the Planorbis trivolvis, our most 

 common species of that genus, is here completely replaced by the 

 P. campanulatus. 



Subjoined is a list of the various fossil shells which I picked up 




Oct., 1845.] 281 



during several hours search along the shore, with the comparative 

 quantities in which they occur. 



Limneus elodes, (Say,) rare. 



Limneus Galbanus, (Say,) abundant. 



Planorbis bicarinatus, (Say,) abundant, 



Planorbis campanulatus, (Say,) abundant.

Valvata bicarinata ? (Lea,) extremely abundant, 



Physa ancillaria, (Say,) abundant. 



Cyclas : a minute species not determined ; abundant. 



Fragments of Unios, which were too small to distinguish the 

 species. 



Mr. James D. Dana submitted the following 



General views on the Classification of Animals. 



In Cuvier's classification of animals, the division Radiata in- 

 cludes all invertebrated animals not comprised in either of the sub- 

 kingdoms, Articulata and Mollusca. Consisting thus only of refuse 

 species, and not limited by positive characters, as Owen states, we 

 should 'not expect that the group could be a natural assemblage. 

 No line of subdivision, however, has yet been made out, which has 

 mei with general favour ; yet greater precision has beengiven to our 

 views of the affinities that run through the animal kingdom, by ap- 

 pealing to the nerves, the seat of sensibility and sentiment, as a 

 basis in classification ; and in this manner the subdivisions have been 

 characterised as follows, by Dr. Grant. 



I. The Vertcbrata, having a brain and a spinal cord, constitute 

 the Spini-Vertebrata. II. The Mollusca, having the nerves 

 forming generally a transverse series of ganglia disposed around 

 the oesophagus, the Cyclo-gangliata. III. The Articulata having 

 no proper brain, and the main cord which runs the length of the 

 body, double, the Diplo-neura. IV. The Radiata, having a ra- 

 diate structure in the body, and the nervous ganglia arranged in a 

 circle, Cyclo-neura. 



34 




282 [Oct., 1845 



An objection might be made to this system, on the ground of the 

 apparent absence of nerves in some of the lower orders. But a 

 real absence can hardly be concluded, from our inability to dis- 

 tinguish them. Many of these animals show by their voluntary 

 motions and sensibility that nervous influences traverse the body: 

 moreover, nervous matter is secreted in lines. We can therefore 

 only infer the indistinctness, and not the absence of nerves from our 

 ineffectual efforts to trace them out; and we must consequently be 

 guided by general structure, in determining the relations of groups, 

 when the nerves fail of giving aid. 



The above arrangement fails, in some respects, of present- 

 ing a clear idea of the system in nature, although highly philoso- 

 phical in its general features. A study of the animal kingdom, as 

 has been lately shown, brings to light lines or general systems of 

 development branching up from the lowest Infusoria to the higher 

 grades of life. It is not true that the forms among the lower grades 

 are actually copied in any of the imperfectly developed young of 

 the superior; yet there is some general analogy, sufficient to indi- 

 cate that the former commence on the same system of development 

 with some of the latter, although carried essentially out of the direct 

 upward line by the peculiar vital forces of the species. The Roti- 

 fera are decidedly crustacean in type. Their stout mandibles 

 are precisely those of the Cyclopidce in position, and also in 

 general form ; and in their mode of reproduction, the animals are 

 closely similar; yet no young crustacean is ever a Rotifer. The 

 latter belongs to the same[system of development with the former, 

 but is a distinct branch, from the regular line, characterized by the 

 peculiar natatory organs, which appear to be the analogues of the 

 branchial or basal appendages to the feet in Crustacea. The same 

 reasoning applies to the Bryozoa or Flustroid polyps, which are as 

 nearly allied to the Tunicata as the Rotifers to Crustacea.* It is a 

 side-development from the imaginary line, which connects the In- 



*The Bryozoa have been placed near the Rotifera ; but the absence of man- 

 dibles, as well as their peculiar type of structure, separates them widely from 

 these crustaceoid species, and allies them as closely to the Tunicata, with 

 which they were first associated by Thomson, under tho name of Tolyzoa. 

 Lister has a finely illustrated article on this subject in the Philosophical Tran- 

 sactions, for 1834, p. 365

fusoria with the Tunicated Molluscs. The Entozoa afford other ex- 

 amples, one branch of them passing into the Crustacea through the 

 Lernceidrc and Caligidae, and the other into the Annelida. 



These remarks are intended to support no monad or Lamarckian 

 theory, but only to elucidate the established principle that there are 

 in nature certain distinct systems or types of development. Each 

 species is developed with some reference to one or the other of these 

 systems, but, through the agency of the vital forces peculiar to 

 itself — forces which there is reason to believe only creative power 

 can change. 



In accordance with these principles, the several orders of 

 animals may be arranged as follows : 



I. Vertebrata. 



III. Articulata. 



Insecta, Myriapoda, 



Arachnida. 

 Crustacea, Annelida. 



II. MOLLUSCA. 



Cephalopoda,Pteropoda, 



Gastropoda, Conchifera, 



Tunicata. 



IV. Radiata. 



Echinodermata. 

 Rotifera, Entozoa. „ , . . , 



Zoophyta,Acalephse. 



Bryozoa. 



V. Protozoa or Infusoria. 



A radiated structure characterizes the simplest form of ani- 

 mal life. Passing up from the monad globule, the structure has 

 its highest development in the Echinoderms. Among Zoophytes, 

 the Hydra forms the first step upward, in which the digestive 

 cavity is a mere sac, which will work equally well inside out, and 

 the mode of reproduction is extremely simple. From this group 

 we pass to the Actinia, in which there is a distinct stomach and a 

 series of fleshy lamellae around the internal cavity — the first rudi- 

 ments of an insolation of the functions of digestion and generation — 

 but the circulating fluid is only the elaborated chyle mingled with 

 more or less water from without. A step farther and we find 

 separate organs for the functions of the liver, and a circulating 

 system, in some Echinoderms. Through the Bryozoa, the In- 

 fusoria are connected with the Tunicata and the other Molluscs ; and 




254 [Oct., 1S45- 



through the Rotifera and Entozoa, they connect with the Articulata, 

 thus passing by each way, out of the true Radiate type, into that 

 which characterizes the higher sub-kingdoms. The Bryozoa, Ro- 

 tifera and Entozoa, may be arranged in the sub-kingdom Radiata, 

 or with the Mollusca and Articulata, whose types of structure they 

 exhibit, though under a Radiate form. 



The Echinoderms, although so strikingly peculiar in some 

 species — -the Echini — yet through the Holothuria, bear closely upon 

 the Articulata; while the Aealephs incline toward the Mollusca. 



In the above remarks, it is not attempted to trace out all the gra- 

 dations in the groups referred to, but only the most prominent. The 

 animal kingdom is throughout a net work of affiliations, yet there 

 are main trunks and larger branches, to which the smaller anasto- 

 mosing ramifications are subordinate. Much study will be required 

 before the system of nature from the Protozoa up, can be correctly 

 mapped out.

The Committee to whom was referred the following 

 description by Mr. James D. Dana, read 14th inst., reported 

 in favour of publication. 



Genus Coryc^us, (Dana.) 



Cyclopidce cephalo-thorace compresso, 3 — 4 articulato ; oculis 

 mediis inconspicuis, sed infrontem duabus lenticulis crystallinis 

 oblatisprsegrandibus, et penitus aliis lenticulis prolatis minoribus, 




286 [Oct., 1845. 



his pigmento instructis ; antennis quatuor, anterioribus simpli- 

 cibus, in utroque sexu sequalibus et brevibus, posterioribus pre- 

 hensilibus ; pedibus duabus subcheliformibus, aliis octo nata- 

 toriis; ovario externo simplici. 



This genus includes minute marine Cyclopidae, none of them 

 exceeding a line in length, and mostly not over two-thirds of a 

 line. They are remarkable for the two large hyaline lenses 

 placed in the front of the animal, their compressed form, the 

 short and simple anterior antenna?, while the posterior pair is 

 prehensile, the presence of only two pair of prehensile legs, 

 which are succeeded by four pairs of natatory legs, similar to 

 those in other Cyclopidae. 



Posterior to the two large oblate lenses, wholly within the 

 animal, there are two oblong or prolate lenses, equally pel- 

 lucid and hyaline in appearance ; each situated behind one of 

 the former, though remote from them, and separated by an 

 open unobstructed space. At the posterior extremity of each 

 of the inner, there is a long mass of pigment of an oblong shape, 

 usually of a crimson or blue color, so deep as to be almost 

 black. The structure here presented is so remarkable, that it 

 may be unsafe to offer any conjecture as to the nature of the 

 organs described. Yet after examining hundreds of spe- 

 cimens, I may express an opinion that we have in these animals 

 a pair of eyes, each xoith two lenses. It is known that in water 

 animals the crystalline lens is usually spherical. But here we 

 have an oblate and prolate spheroid combined for the same 

 result. The genus Sapphirina, of Thomson, affords other ex- 

 amples of the same character, waich will be the subject of 

 remark at a future time.

Dr. Joseph Leidy stated, as the result of his observation by 

 the microscope, of a portion of a vertebra of the fossil Zeuglo- 

 don of Alabama, that it presented all the characters, well 

 denned, of recent bone. 



Dr. Morton made the following remarks on the skulls of 

 two natives of New Holland, deposited by him this evening. 



After many fruitless attempts to obtain some of the crania of 

 these singular people, I am at length indebted to Dr. Charles 

 Nicholson, an intelligent naturalist of Sydney, for two remarkably 

 well characterised skulls, male and female, respecting which I 

 submit the following notes. 



Both these heads have several characters in common ; they 

 are thick, ponderous, long and narrow, the forehead being low, 

 and the occipital region remarkably full. The orbits are deep 

 and quadrangular, the bones of the nose short and compressed, 

 and the nasal meatus wide and arched at the sides. 



The sutures are throughout remarkable for their simplicity, and 

 in the woman the coronal and spheno-temporal sutures are con- 

 tinuous; an arrangement that is not unfrequent in the negro. 

 In the female head, also, the coronal region is very low. In the 

 man it is higher, and the area of the temporal muscle is particu- 

 larly conspicuous. This cranium is also marked by several cica- 

 trised depressions of the external table, of which the two largest 

 are on the frontal and parietal bones. These wounds are readily 

 accounted for in the irascible and pugnacious character of the 

 Australian savages. 



The preceding characteristics are, in general, analogous to those 

 of the African negro ; but a striking osteological difference be- 

 tween the two races, consists in the far greater prominence of the 

 face in the Negro than in the Australian. In the former the 

 facial angle was established by Prof. Camper at 75°, and this has 

 been confirmed by nearly one hundred measurements by my 

 own hands. Yet in the two Australians before us, the angle in 

 the man measures 84°, in the woman 81°, or more than the Cau- 

 casian mean. This, however, does not result, as we have seen, 

 from a well-formed cranium, but from a fulness of the supra- 

 orbitar region, and the small and non-projecting character of the 

 face. These features of the facial structure are remarkably ex- 




Dec, 1845] 293 



emplified in all the profile drawings I have seen of the Austra- 

 lians ; for the face is often but little more salient than in the Eu- 

 ropean, while every other characteristic partakes largely of the 

 Negro.

 accordance with a resolution of the Society, directing appli- 

 cation to be made for a complete copy of the Natural History 

 of that State for the Library. The Society was informed 

 that no copy was at present at the disposal of the Depart- 

 ment. 



A paper, by Alfred T. King, M.D., of Greensburg, Pennsyl- 

 vania, entitled, " Descriptions of fossil foot prints," was read 

 and referred to the following Committee, viz. : Prof. Johnson, 

 Dr. Morton and Mr. Cassin. 



Professor Johnson communicated some observations on the re- 

 lative evaporation from land and water surfaces, and stated the 

 means by which the question had been investigated, referring to 

 the report, a copy of which was presented to the Academy at the 

 last meeting, concerning the water sources near Boston, for a por- 

 tion of the details of experiments and observations, by which the 

 ratio in question had been established. 



The method of research was stated to have comprised, 1st, an 

 observation- of the quantity of water falling in rain ; — 2d, the 

 quantity flowing away by the outlet of the source ; — 3d, the 

 depth removed from the surface of water by evaporation ; and 

 4th, the relation between the area of ground covered by Avater, 

 and of that constituting the water shed or drainage, from which, 

 owing to the direction of its slope, the rain falling upon it, must 

 necessarily pass into the pond or lake, constituting the source of 

 immediate supply. The plan pursued required of course a de- 

 termination by actual surveys, of the total area of ground em- 

 braced within the district or hydrographic basin, and also that of 

 the water surface at several different stages of height correspond- 



36 




296 [Dec, 1845. 



ino- to the several periods of observation, in order to establish the 

 ratio above referred to, between the land surface and the water 

 surface at each of those periods. 



With these data, and a simple formula of easy application, it 

 will be found practicable, not only to establish the ratio of supply 

 from the surrounding slopes, to the whole quantity of rain falling 

 during a season, but also the ratio which evaporation on land, 

 bears to that on the water surface. 



The quantity, or bulk of water, removed from any source, such 

 as a lake or pond, during any given period of observation, will 

 consist of first, the draught, or flow from the outlet, and second, of 

 that removed by evaporation. 



This quantity, determined by actual guaging, is readily referred 

 to the known area of water-surface, simultaneously observed — and 

 the depth to which it would cover the same surface if again res- 

 tored, is thereby ascertained. 



The supply of this quantity may be derived from 1st, the store 

 previously accumulated in the pond or lake ; 2d, from rain which 

 falls directly on the ivater- surface during the period of observa- 

 tion ; or 3d, from the drainage, or flow from the surrounding 

 slopes. 



When the level of the lake falls during the period of observa- 

 tion, it is evident that something has been taken from the accu- 

 mulated store, and if the amount of depression of level, and the 

 depth of rain guaged, be not together equal to the sum of 

 draught and evaporation observed, it is evident that the third 

 source of supply — viz : the drainage from the water-shed, must 

 have furnished the balance. If, on the other hand, the level of 

 the source have risen, something has been added to the store of 

 water previously accumulated ; and in this case the depth of rain 

 and the supply from the water-shed, have exceeded the sum of 

 draught and evaporation, and the measures of level and of area 

 show the amount of this excess. In either case the supply de- 

 rived from the surrounding slopes is easily eliminated, since all 

 the other terms of the equation are known. 



From the 7th of August, to the 1st of November, of the pre- 

 sent year, — the time in which the observations, surveys and gaug- 

 ings, required for the purposes above designated, were made in the 

 district of Spot Pond, 9 miles north west from Boston, — the depth 




Dec, 1845.] 297 



of rain guaged was 10.17 inches; the evaporation from the sur- 

 face of the pond was 15.07 inches, showing the evaporation to be 

 48.1 per cent, more than the depth of rain. By an average of five 

 periods of observation into which this time was divided, the ratio 

 of water derived from the slopes, to the rain which fell upon them 

 was .1765 to 1., or the actual depth was 1.79 inches. Conse- 

 quently, the evaporation from the land, and from its vegetable 

 covering, was .8235 of the rain which descended. Hence the 

 ratio between the evaporation from land, and that from water, was 

 .8235 : 1.48l=.55G : 1. 



In the district of Long Pond, 18 miles south west from Boston, 

 from the 30th of July to the first of November, the depth of rain 

 was 10.46 inches; and of evaporalion 12.78 inches — conse- 

 quently the evaporation was 22.2 per cent, more than the rain. 



The water derived from the slopes of the district was .1839 of 

 the whole fall of rain, leaving .8161 : 1 as the proportion evapora- 

 ted from the land, or appropriated by vegetation, and the ratio of 

 evaporation from land to that from the water, was consequently 

 .8161 : 1.222= .667 : 1. 



It appears from comparisons of the annual falls of rains for long 



periods-of years, that the quantities of rain above stated, as having 



fallen in the months of August, September, and October last, at 



the two sources mentioned, are about the average quantities due 



to those months, and that consequently the ordinary ratio which, 



in the neighborhood of Boston, and at the season above specified, 



may be expected to flow from the land, and be available in water 



. .1765+. 1839 1ono , , no 



sources is =.1802 or almost exactly 18 per cent. At 



other seasons, very different proportions between the quantity of 

 rain, and that of evaporation, would be found to prevail. Whether 

 in the winter season, the same ratio would be found to exist be- 

 tween the evaporation from land, and that from a water surface, as 

 has been found to prevail in summer, is a question still awaiting 

 a practical, experimental determination. The same methods of 

 research, as have been applied in the above cases, would be found 

 applicable to its solution, substituting only in part the fall of snow 

 guaged as water for that of rain, and the evaporation from a sur- 

 face of ice for that from a surface of water. 



The elevated and insulated position of Spot Pond, resting in a 




29S [Dec, 1845. 



basin composed of igneous rocks, and these partly bare of vege- 

 tation, was referred to, as favoring the continuance of the water 

 which falls upon the slopes, for a considerable time in contact 

 with the air, and subjected to evaporation before it reaches the 

 pond. This was considered adequate to account for the small 

 difference .1839 — .1764= .0064 between the drainage from that 

 district, and the one found at Long Pond.

Description of Fossil Foot Prints. 

 By Alfred T. King, M. D. 



It is now more than a year since fossil foot prints were discovered 

 in the sandstone of the coal measures in Westmoreland county, 

 Pennsylvania. Since then, numerous localities have been ob- 

 served, which contain well characterized impressions. Some of 

 these are similar to, and a few identical with, those which I first 

 described, but by far the greatest number are totally different 

 from any which have heretofore been observed. 



About three miles from this town, near the summit of the first 

 anticlinal roll, west of Chesnut ridge, one of the principal axes of 

 elevation belonging to the Alleghany range, in a coarse grained 

 sandstone, are eight remarkable impressions, all having the same 

 dimensions, the same distance apart, and forming a continuous se- 

 ries in a slightly bent line. _ Each is of an ovoidal form, 13 inches 

 long, 9 broad, and from 3 to 6 deep. The impression is deep 

 and ovoidal before, but superficial behind, as though made by an 

 animal with a long and flexible pastern. 



Twenty-seven miles from Greensburgh, on the summit of 

 Chesnut ridge, in a coarse grained sandstone, are numerous im- 

 prints, as perfect as they are anomalous and remarkable. These 

 imprints are of different kinds : the greatest number seem to have 

 been made by rvminant mammals, as the feet were cleft so as to 

 resemble those of the ox and deer, but much larger. They are 

 of various sizes, and differ from most living types, in having two 

 hind hoofs, which made deep and vivid impressions from one to 

 two inches behind the main track. 



The length of the largest, including the posterior imprints, is 9 

 inches, breadth 5f inches. 



The smaller vary from 44 to 5| inches in length, by 2k to 

 4s in breadth. The general form of these foot marks is ovoidal, 

 the largest portion being behind as well as the widest part of the 




300 [Dec, 1S45. 



cleft. The posterior impressions are each about the size of a 

 walnut. The interval between each foot mark is about 2g feet 

 in the larger, and 18 inches in the smaller. 



Besides these, and a few others which are identical or nearly 

 so with some which I have already described on a former occa- 

 sion, there are four or five huge imprints of a still more remarka- 

 ble character than any that have heretofore met my eye. They 

 are in a continuous line: each imprint is 13 inches long, and 9 

 wide. The toes, which are five in number, are thick and very 

 perfect. Four of these imprints are quite perfect, others are less 

 so, and many are nearly obliterated. The average distance be- 

 tween each impression is 3 feet 7 inches, with the exception of 

 the last two, which are seven feet apart. This seems to indicate 

 that there was once a track between these two, which has been 

 defaced by the erosive action of the elements upon the rock during 

 a series of ages. 



The Committee on Mr. Edward Harris' description of a 

 new species of Parus from Missouri, read at last meeting, re- 

 ported in favour of publication. 



Description of a new species of Parus from the Upper Missouri. 

 By Edward Hakris. 



Parus sepicntrionalis. Young, in summer plumage. 



Bill brownish black, short and stout. Iris dark brown. Feet greyish 

 blue. Upper part of the head, chin and foreneck dull black; the black of 

 the head scarcely descending to the hindneck, and that on the foreneck 

 hardly reaching to the breast. Cheeks and sides of the neck, a line running 

 from the base of the bill under the eye and almost meeting on the hindneck, 

 white. Back greyish, slightly tinged with yellow. Quills and tail feathers 

 dark greyish brown, margined with pure white; secondaries conspicuously 

 so. Lower parts greyish white with an almost imperceptible tinge of yel- 

 lowish under the wings. 



Length 5f. Wing 211. Tail 3 H inches. 



A single specimen of this bird was procured on the 26th of July, on the 

 Yellow Stone River, about thirty miles above its junction with the Missouri. 

 It is evidently a bird of the season, with immature plumage, to which may 

 be attributed the dulness of the black on the head and throat. On com- 

 parison of this bird with P. Carolinensis and P. atricapillus, it will be per- 

 ceived that, beginning with the smallest bird, the parts which are black, de- 




Dec, 1845.J 301 



crease, and the white parts increase in size and intensity in ascending. In 

 septentrionalis the outer weh of the lateral tail feather is entirely white, ex- 

 cept a small portion near the base, where there is a slight tinge of grey next 

 the shaft, and the quills, secondaries and all the tail feathers are margined 

 more broadly and with a purer white than in the other species. 



I have given a table showing the comparative measurements of the three 

 American species of this division of the genus Parus having black heads, 

 which so closely resemble each other in voice, habits and markings; and 

 have also added some measurements from a paper in the Archives of the 

 Academy, by M. de Selys-Longchamps, Corresponding Member of the 

 Royal Academy of Brussels, extracted from their Bulletin, vol. 10, No. 7. 

 I have reduced his measurements to English inches and decimals, and have 

 given my own also in decimals for more ready comparison. It will be seen 

 that his specimen from Iceland (frigoris) corresponds so nearly with our 

 atricapillus as to render it probable that it is identical, while his utricapillus 

 from Brisson is so near to Audubon's Carolinensis as to render it almost certain 

 that the description of P. atricapillus by the old authors was from our small 

 southern bird. If this opinion be correct, our Carolinensis should resume the 

 name of atricapillus, and the larger bird be called frigoris, as suggested by 

 M. de Selys-Longchamps. 



The note of this bird is similar to atricapillus, but its voice more liquid, 

 and less harsh and querulous in the utterance. Bill longer and stouter.

It will be seen by the above table, that while in each of the old American 

 species the wingis .125, or § of an inch longer than the tail, in the new bird, 

 the tail is .281, or nearly^ of an inch longer than the wing,- compared with 

 atricapillus, the total length is greater by f of an inch, the wing by f , and 

 tail by 8| r more than half an inch.

The colours in this immature specimen are only t»be depended upon as 

 showing the much greater development of the white, and smaller extent of 

 the black markings, than in the other species. For the sake of more easy 

 reference, the description has been made parallel with those ofAudubon in 

 his Synopsis. I would propose as an appropriate English name for this bird, 

 the <; long-tailed black-cap Titmouse."

 gins broadly yellow and ordinarily elevated ; anterior edge obtusely rounded, 

 and fringed with short black hairs; posterior edge elevated ; disk slightly in- 

 equal ; a roundish impression in front of the scutel ; posterior angles excurved, 

 deflexed, rather acute : elytra black, with longitudinal, slightly raised lines, and 

 alternate obsolete ones; interstices with numerous transverse lines: beneath and 

 feet black ; pleura yellow. This may prove to be the marginellus of Fabricius, 

 but the elytra are not sulcated, as is stated to be the case in that species.

Black, with a reddish-brown tinge: head piceous ; mouth dull testaceous: 

 antenna; blackish, not compressed, with three basal joints piceous, second joint 

 half as long as the third, which is somewhat shorter than the fourth, tho latter 

 and fifth sub-equal : thorax as in the preceding species, but the anterior margin 

 is also yellow, and the edge obtusely rounded ; the medial groove distinct and 

 nearly entire : elytra black, with a tinge of reddish, and with the anterior lateral 

 fourth obsoletely rufo-piceous; each elytrum with three longitudinal raised lines; 

 lateral edges and suture raised ; beneath and feet blackish. The obtusely round-

 to distinguish this species from the preceding. 



Lychnuius, Dej. Catal 



L. morio. Black; lateral thoracic margins dull testaceous; elytra four-ribbed. 

 5J I. long; 2 1. wide. Pennsylvania. 



Black or black-brown ; antenna compressed, black-brown, with the joints sub-

 sides slightly sinuated a little behind the apex, which is acutely rounded : minute- 

 ly and densely wrinkled, black, with the anterior and lateral, margins dull tes- 

 taceous : scutel acute-triangular : elytra finely granulate or shagreened with four 

 or rather five longitudinal raised lines, which are more or less abbreviated before 

 the apex : beneath and feet black, with the terminal ventral segment dull testa- 

 ceous. Form and size of hampyris laticornis, Fab., to which it is closely 

 allied, but it differs from it in having the apex of the thorax more acutely round- 

 eJ; in the lateral margins being less broadly testaceous, the disk more inequal, 

 and in the raised lines of the elytra being more distinctly defined. 



Ellychnia, Dej. Catal. 



E. autumnalis. Black-brown ; sub-margins of the thorax whitish, with a ro- 

 saceous spot. 4 j I, long; 2 1. wide. Pennsylvania.

 margins whitish, with an oblong rosaceous spot; exterior margins black and not 

 attaining the apex; basal edge very slightly sinuate; scutel glabrous; elytra 

 finely shagreened, with about three obsolete, longitudinal raised lines ; beneath 

 and feet black ; pleurae within the margins whitish, tinged with rosaceous. 

 Bears a resemblance, in the dispositions of the colors of the thorax, to Lampyris 

 corrusca, Fabr., but it can hardly be confounded with that species, as itis almost 

 three times smaller, and has the elytral lines obsolete. It also resembles I.. 

 nigricans, Say, but apart of inferiority of size, it differs from that species in 

 having the lateral thoracic margins exteriorly black, and the disk orbicular-con-

 found and together with the striae obsolete towards the apex ; sides parallel; a 

 common white fascia a little behind the middle: beneath blackish, deeply punc-

(To be continued.) 



The following report, the conclusion of which was read at 

 the meeting of 23d inst; was referred for publication to the 

 Committee on Proceedings. 



Examination and analyses of samples of the alluvial soil of the Nile, from 

 Korosco, in Nubia. 

 By Walter R. Johnson. 



The specimens about to be described are the same which were on the 21st 

 of January last presented to the Academy, by Mr. Gliddon, from Dr. Richard 

 Lepsius of Berlin, then in Egypt, (see proceedings of the Acad. vol. 2, p. 

 195,) and referred to the reporter for examination. 



No. I. — Earth of the Nile taken from the summit of hillocks at thirty feet 

 above the present level of the river about a mile above Korosko. 



This earth is partly in powder and partly in lumps. In some of the latter, 

 distant traces of folia, or plies, marking an imperfect stratification, are to be 

 seen. Along these seams fractures often occur. Throughout the lumps are 

 to be observed innumerable cavities or spiracles of a tortuous form, giving 

 the impression of having been produced by some species of vermes. Many 

 of these are lined and some nearly filled up with carbonate of lime. 

 Tubes of the same material are found in a separate state, and some plane sur- 

 faces are covered with it. The whole has a light spongy appearance, and, 

 the resemblance is strengthened by the vermicular cavities, which remind 

 one of the white tubes often found traversing masses of common sponge. 

 Very fine micaceous particles are distributed pretty copiously through the 

 masses, distinctly perceptible to the eye, and clearly exhibiting their forms 

 under the lens. To the naked eye no ferruginous appearance is discernible, 

 but the microscope shows innumerable points of a deep red colour. The mud 

 appears to have been deposited at successive, but not very distant periods ;

while soft to have been penetrated by myriads of animalcule ; then dried 

 and baked into a solid mass, imprisoning and destroying the animals, 

 and forming a very porous soil, which, on subsequent exposure to water, 

 strongly impregnated with lime, received so much of the latter as to fill up 

 many of the pores when the water came to be dried up. 



Analysis. 1. The existence of roots, stems, or of any other fibrous matter 

 was sought for in vain in this specimen, and the magnet separates from it. 

 only minute quantities of magnetic oxide of iron. 



2. Fifty grains placed in a syphon-shaped drying tube in which it was ex- 

 posed to a heat of 212° for thirty minutes, and over which, during the whole 

 time, a current of perfectly dry air, amounting in all to 200 cubic inches was 

 passed, lost by this treatment 2.1 grains or 4.2 per cent. 



3. One hundred grains of the soil were boiled for ten minutes in four or 

 five ounces of distilled water, then filtered and washed. The insoluble resi- 

 duum, separated and dried, weighed 93.5 grains, and is of a reddish grey, 

 slightly varying in colour from the original soil. Deducting 4.2 from the 

 loss, the part soluble in boiling water is 2.3 per cent. To the clear solution 

 nitrate of silver imparted a slight milkiness, indicating the presence of chlo- 

 rine. Chloride of barium, producing no turbidness, implied the absence of 

 soluble sulphates. Oxalate of ammonia, gave evidence of a salt of lime so- 

 luble in boiling water. Phosphate of soda and ammonia gave no evidence of 

 magnesia, and ferrocyanide of potassium, none of iron. The liquid slowly 

 evaporated to dryness, left a residuum, which in the bottom of the porcelain 

 basin separated into a yellowish ring of crenic acid, giving the usual impres- 

 sion, first of acidity and then of astringency to the taste, and a central portion 

 of white crenate or carbonate of lime. 



4. Another portion of one hundred grains was exposed in a platinum cruci- 

 ble to a dull red heat over a lamp, by which it lost 8.65 grains, showing the 

 insoluble organic matter to be 2.15 per cent. The same portion afterwards 

 exposed for fifteen minutes to a nearly white heat lost in addition 5.3 grains, 

 and became of a light brick red colour. 



5. A third portion of one hundred grains finely pulverized was placed in 

 a green glass flask. An ounce of distilled water was poured over it, and an 

 open-mouthed tube containing chlorhydric acid was inserted, the mouth closed 

 with a cork traversed by a small glass tube surmounted by a tube containing 

 chloride of calcium. The whole being carefully counterpoised, the acid was 

 by degrees decanted and allowed to act on the soil. Heat was cautiously 

 applied near the close of the operation, bringing the liquid at length to gentle 

 ebullition, but taking care that no pure steam entered the chloride tube. On 

 cooling the apparatus, the air was allowed to pass through a second chloride 

 tube attached to the first, thus avoiding the hygrometric moisture of the air. 

 When the whole apparatus had become cool, heat was again applied and the 

 boiling and cooling repeated with the same precautions, until, on re-weighin°-, 

 no loss was found to occur between one boiling and another. The final loss 

 of carbonic acid was thus ascertained to be 5.55 per cent. 



6. Having withdrawn the cork from the flask, more chlorhydric acid was 

 added, and the boiling continued until every thing soluble had been taken up. 



39 




320 [Dec. 1845. 



The undissolved residuum filtered, washed, and ignited weighing 63.55 

 grains. It is a powder of a lighter grey than the original soil. Minute par- 

 ticles of white quartz, and some with a reddish tint are discernible by the 

 help of a lens. 



7. The solution filtered from the above residuum was treated with sulphydric 

 acid, to ascertain whether lead, copper, mercury, tin, antimony, or arsenic, 

 existed in the soil. A reddish white tint, indicative of a bare trace of anti- 

 mony, was all which could be procured. The liquid smelling strongly of sul- 

 phydric acid, the sulphur was separated, and then the solution was neutral- 

 ized with pure ammonia. 



8. Sulphydrate of ammonia was added, throwing down a copious precipa- 

 tate of sulphuret of iron and alumina, which was filtered out, redissolved in 

 chlorhydric acid, with a little nitric, and boiled to peroxidize the iron; the 

 solution was then precipitated and boiled with pure potash, separating the 

 iron, which being ignited, weighed in the state of peroxide 8.07 grains. 



9. Having acidulated the potash liquid, it was precipitated by ammonia 

 and gave of ignited alumina 2.64 grains. 



10. The solution, filtered from the sulphurets, was concentrated, treated 

 with chlorhydric acid, the precipitated sulphur separated, and after neutral- 

 izing by ammonia, was precipitated with oxalate of ammonia, allowed to re- 

 pose 18 hours, then heated and filtered. The oxalate of lime thus obtained, 

 was, after ignition, repeatedly moistened with a solution of carbonate of am- 

 monia, and re-ignited till it ceased to gain weight. The carbonate of lime 

 was 12.6 grains. 



11. Ammonio-phosphate of soda applied to the liquid filtered from the oxa- 

 late of lime, after the same had been duly concentrated, entirely cooled and 

 neutralized by pure ammonia, threw down ammonio-phosphate of magnesia, 

 which, separated and ignited, gave of phosphate of magnesia, 5.15 grains, equal 

 to 2.06 grains of magnesia, or 4.25 of its carbonate.

No. 2. — Specimen of the present soil of the Valley of Korosco, taken at a 

 height of three feet above the Nile. 



This earth is also partly in lumps and partly in powder. Tho former exhibit 

 no marks of stratification, and so far as can be observed, have no tendency to 

 part in one direction more than in another. The texture is open and porous, 

 but the pores are not filled as in No. 1, with any deposite of white matter, ex- 

 cept here and there a rather light gray in the interior of the cavities. In some 

 of the lumps, minute rootlets are seen traversing ihe mass in different directions. 

 The color of this soil is considerably darker than that of No. 1, due in part no 

 doubt to the absence of carbonate of lime. Ferruginous particles abound in 

 this, as in the preceding specimen, but those of mica are of far less frequent 

 occurrence. 



Time has allowed me to make but a few trials to ascertain the composition 

 of this soil, as it was believed to be of more interest to determine the relative 

 characters of the oldest and of the most recent ones, rather than that of an in- 

 termediate period. By twice drying in the inverted syphon apparatus, and in 

 the last instance passing over it 200 cubic inches of air, thoroughly dry, it lost 

 2.6 per cent. By treatment in the apparatus for separating carbonic acid, and 

 boiling five times successively to expel the last atom of that material, using a 

 solution of pure baryta to ascertain when the escaping air, expelled in boiling, 

 ceased to be mixed with that acid, it was found that the amount of carbonic acid 

 was only 1.7 per cent, equivalent to 3.9 per cent, of carbonate of lime. On 

 separating the soil witli the sieve, the finest portion — that passing through the 

 gauze'sieve — was found to afford decidedly more magnetic oxide of iron, than speci- 

 men No. 1. 



No. 3. — Specimen of the earth newly deposited at Korosco, the 18th of 



August, 1844. 



This specimen is entirely in powder, and of a color very nearly approaching 

 that of No. 2. 



Particles of mica are of rather rare occurrence. A few minute fragments of 

 straw or grass are detected, and by a gauze sieve, of which Ihe meshes are 100 

 to the inch, and the spaces to the threads as 2f to 1 in diameter, making the 



open spaces 7 of an inch square only, 22 percent, of this earth was arrested. 



A quantity of very fine fibrous or downy matter was also collected by the seive. 

 Portions of both the coarser and the finer parts of this soil are attracted by the 

 magnet, 4-tentli3 of one per cent, being found in an average portion of it. On 

 being washed, the coarser part is found to be a sand, composed of quartz, red and 

 white, fragments of schorl, and garnets, of magnetic oxide of iron, a little mica, 

 and a few fragments of tubes, such as are seen traversing the older portions of 

 soil already examined. This composition indicates that this specimen has re- 

 sulted from the decomposition ot primitive rocks, and that their debris has been 

 mixed with some portion of the anterior deposits along the river banks. 



Analysis. 



1. Dried 100 grains and found the loss, 3.7 grains. 



2. Transferred the same to a well closed platinum crucible, and ignited ; which 




322 [Dec, 1845. 



caused an additional loss of 3.57 per cent. The powder having now a dull red- 

 dish gray color, was again heated, and with access of air, stirring occasionally 

 with a platinum spatula, to facilitate the complete combustion of organic 

 matter. 



By this treatment the additional loss was .13 grain, showing the organic 

 matter in the soil to be 3.70 per cent. To ascertain what part of ths matter 

 was soluble, a second portion of 100 grains was placed in a green glass matras 

 and boiled for an hour, with three ounces of a saturated solution of carbonate of 

 ammonia ; the clear liquid was decanted, and a second portion of the carbonate 

 added, boiling as before, and in the same way a third portion was subsequently 

 added. The solution being acidulated with acetic acid, acetate of lead was ap- 

 plied, producing when dried, 4.7 grains of crenate of lead, equivalent to 2.28 

 grains of crenic acid, and showing the insoluble organic matter to be 1.42 

 grains. 



3. Placed the reddened powder of the first 100 grains in a matras, and poured 

 over it an ounce of pure water and half an ounce of pure chlorhydric acid ; 

 boiled half an hour, decanted the clear liquid, put in another ounce of water and 

 half ounce of acid, boiled for the same length of time, decanted once more and 

 repeated the operation — then filtered, washed carefully, ignited and weighed the 

 residue, found it 70.2 grains, showing that 22.4 grains of matter have been dis- 

 solved by the acid 



4. Tho solution in chlorhydric acid, reduced to a convenient bulk, was boiled 

 with a little nitric acid, to peroxidize the iron, by which it was changed from 

 greenish yellow to a fine deep red color, and while still hot, precipitated with 

 pure ammonia, boiled to condense the precipitate, filtered, washed for more than 

 24 hours, and until all alkaline reaction ceased. 



5. The precipitate was boiled in a strong solution of caustic potash, until the 

 clear liquid yielded with chlorhydric acid the usual indications of a sufficient 

 excess of alkali. 



6. The remaining precipitate of oxide of iron was filtered and washed for 

 12 hours, with hot water, separated, dried, and ignited sufficiently long to reduce 

 the whole to the state of peroxide, which then weighed 9.18 grains. 



7. The potash solution was acidulated with chlorhydric acid, and precipitated 

 by carbonate of ammonia, yielding, after being thoroughly washed, dried and 

 ignited, 6.55 grains of alumina. 



8. The ammoniacal solution filtered from oxide of iron and alumina, was 

 treated for phosphate of lime, and afterwards with oxalate of ammonia, and, 

 allowing ample time to precipitate, the oxalate of lime was filtered, washed, con- 

 verted into carbonate, and in that stale weighed, giving 6.7 grains. Converted 

 this, by exposure three times to a white heat, into caustic lime, weighing exactly 

 3-8 grains. 



9. The liquid from which oxalate of lime had been filtered, was now with the 

 usual precautions precipitated with ammonio-phosphate of soda, the precipitate 

 cautiously washed, and the double phosphate ignited, giving phosphate of 

 magnesia 5>18 grains, equivalent to 1-89 grains of -magnesia. 



1 0. To the liquid filtered from ammonio-phosphate of magnesia, added sulph. 




Dec, 1845.] 323 



hydrate of ammonia, and obtained calcined precipitate from the .3 grain of 

 oxide of manganese. 



11. A third portion of 100 grains of the soil, treated for carbonic add with all 

 the precautions of boiling the liquid, and alternately cooling off ten times, until 

 the pure baryta showed no more carbonic acid, and the successive weighings 

 gave identical results, the quantity of that ingredient was found to be only 

 1-4 grains. Hence the soil is composed of

The excess is here attributable in part to the peroxidation of the iron, which 

 in the soil is partly in the state of magnetic oxide, and in part to the pre- 

 sumed slight amount of potash still adhering to the oxide and alumina. 



Sand taken from the thermal spring at Okme, on the Southern frontier of the 

 Province of Butir-el-Hagar, on the Western bank of the Nile — where the 

 temperature of the water is 131° Fah. 



This sand obviously contains the debris of granitic rocks. Particles of 

 quartz and mica are very abundant, and the magnet takes up a notable portion 

 of magnetic oxide of iron. Particles of highly ferruginous clay ars inter- 

 spersed among it, resembling crumbs of bog iron ore, and leading to the 

 supposition that the heat of the spring is occasioned by the decomposition 

 of pyritius rocks, whose insoluble debris it brings in minute portions to 

 the surface. The gauze sieve already mentioned retains 25 per cent, of this 

 sand, including nearly all the particles of ferruginous clay. The portion 

 which passes the seive, resembles, in almost every particular, the sandy por- 

 tion washed out of the newly deposited soil, except of course the different 

 degree of its fineness. Both have particles of red and wmite quartz, both 

 show magnetic oxide of iron, the sand of the spring in the greater abundance. 

 It is remarked that the particles of this oxide in the portion of sand which 

 passes the sieve, is far greater than in that which remains upon it, which we 

 might anticipate, on the supposition that the sand is brought up by the spring. 

 The greater specific gravity of the particles of oxide than that of the quartz, 

 would allow larger masses of the latter than of the former to be thrown up 

 by a current of given velocity.

Bringing together the results of the analysis of the ancient and that of the 

 most recent soil, we find the following composition in 100 parts.

Insoluble organic matter, - - - - 2.15 1.42

Loss, 2.37 Ox. of Manganese .30

100.45 



The loss in the analysis of the ancient soil, is attributed in part to the com- 

 bined water, which no doubt existed in the peroxide of iron, and in part to the 

 chloride of sodium and phosphate of alumina, of which some traces were 

 observed, but of which time did not allow me to make a minute examination, 

 or to repeat the analysis for (he purpose of an exact determination of their 

 proportion. The most striking difference between the ancient and the mo- 

 dern soils is to be found in the far higher proportion of carbonic acid, lime, 

 and magnesia in the former, and the greater abundance of alumina and of in- 

 soluble silicates in the latter. The matter soluble in water is nearly the 

 same for both, and the oxide of iron 'not widely different.
