BOTANICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE MEXICAN FLORA, ESPECIALLY ON THE FLORA OF THE VALLEY OF MEXICO.
BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGER, PH.
D. Leaving Philadelphia, Tuesday August 4, 1896, for a botanical excursion to Mexico, the capital of the Republic was reached Tuesday August 11th, at 6 p. m. Several stops were made en route, one at St. Louis, where the Missouri Botanical Garden was visited, and one at Eagle Pass, Texas, where Sunday was spent.
During the sojourn in the City of Mexico, numerous botanical trips were made into the surrounding country in company with Mr. C. G. Pringle, to whom I extend my most hearty thanks for much kindness and suggestive help.
The itinerary is herewith given.
ITINERARY.
August 12, 1896, {Wednesday).
— Visited a number of the lots in the City of Mexico, where cattle and burros are allowed to roam at will, and where a number of interesting plants were collected.
August 13th, (Thursday).
— Mr. Pringle, Tranquelino Duran, a Mexican boy, and the writer visited Salazar by the National Railroad.
Salazar is situated on the crest of the western mountain ridge, known as the Sierra de las Cruces.
Here was fought, in 1810, the battle between Hidalgo and the Spaniards, resulting in a victory for the patriots.
Salazar is situated at an elevation of from 10,000 to 11,000 feet above sea level.
Many cool springs gush from the hillsides, mostly denuded of timber, and many alpine plants were found in the upland meadows.
August 15th, (Saturday).
— Tlalpam was visited this day.
In reaching this town, we passed through Cherubusco, made famous by the fight there between the Americans and Mexicans.
Tlalpam is a quiet suburban town of some 7,000 inhabitants, fourteen miles south of the City of Mexico.
There are many flower and fruit gardens hereabouts, for the supply of the city markets ; important factories of cotton, woollen cloth and paper are in the neighborhood.
The eastern road from Tlalpam leads to Lake Xochimilcho, where we gathered the several interesting aquatics found on and near the chinarapas.
The botanist must needs hire a canoe to procure specimens.
The town is a veritable Venice.
August 17, (Monday).
— The town and hills of Guadalupe, the Cerro de Tepeyac and Cerro de Gachupines visited, and a number of noteworthy plants collected.
Guadalupe, some three miles north of the capital, is reached by tram-cars from the Plaza Mayor, and is interesting on account of the Sacred Chapel of Nuestra Seiiora de Guadalupe.
August ISth, (Tuesday).
— An interesting locality visited this day was that of LaCima near the summit of Ajusco at about 10,000 feet elevation.
The hill above the Indian town afforded more plants than could be conveniently carried.
The pedregal in the neighborhood also yielded a rich harvest.
August 20th, (Thursday).
— This day was spent in the neighborhood of Tlalpam, where the fields and ditches yielded a rich supply of plants.
The edge of the Tlalpam pedregal was visited, and the interesting plants of the northern portion of the lava-bed collected and noted.
August 22d, (Saturday).
— Another trip was made to the Tlalpam pedregal and to the hills beyond.
In the pedregal, Senecio praecox DC, Cereus serpentimis and Wigandia were noted, and specimens collected for future study at home.
August 25th, (Tuesday).
— The pedregal of Tlalpam extending to Tizapan, the lava bed was visited in the neighborhood of that town.
Here the plants were found in the same abundance as lower down the mountain side, so that the pedregal in all its parts may be said to be a veritable flower garden.
August 26th, (Wednesday).
— The writer left the City of Mexico for the Mexican tropics, via the Mexican Railroad to Orizaba and Cordoba ; the next few days were spent amid the tropical luxuriance of the Mexican flora.
Epiphytic orchids and other interesting plants were collected about Orizaba and in the neighborhood of the waterfall called Rincon Grande.
August 29th, (Saturday).
— Returned to the City of Mexico, where the plants collected in the tierra caliente were preserved, some in formalin, others by drying.
August 31st, (Monday).
— Visited the Tlalpam pedregal on the Mexican, Cuernavaca and Pacific Railroad at a much higher elevation than formerly visited, at about 9,000 feet.
Here Dahlias were found in the greatest profusion and abundance.
Returning down the mountain side after a rough tramp over the pedregal, we took a train for the City at Eslava, where a number of plants were found.
September 1st, (Tuesday).
— Left the City of Mexico alone en route for Guadalajara via Irapuato, where a number of days (September 2d to September 5th) were spent.
The celebrated barranca was visited in company with an Indian, and a number of plants collected.
September 5th-September 9, 1896.
— This time was profitably spent in a trip to Tampico on the Gulf Coast.
1 En route the beautiful Tamasopo Canon was admired, as also the extensive palm forests about Rascon and eastward.
No botanical exploration of the country was made.
September 10, 1896.
— Ciudad Juarez and El Paso were reached on the homeward journey.
A hasty botanical survey was made of the hills about El Paso, but little of interest was found in the immediate vicinage of the town, because of the extreme dryness of the season.
TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHY OF THE PLACES VISITED.
The Valley of Mexico, situated 7,350 feet above the level of the sea, is of an elliptical form with its long axis running in a north and south direction.
The greatest length of the valley according to Orozco and Berra is from Cerro de Sincoque on the north to Cerro del Teutli on the southern border of Lake Xochimilcho, a distance of about 45 miles.
The greatest breadth of the valley is from the Hacienda de los Morales, westward a distance of 21 miles.
This most beautiful of basin-shaped valleys is walled in by high hills and lofty mountains on all sides.
Sierra del Ajusco rises in a series of ridges and peaks to the south, the highest point the volcano of Ajusco, long since extinct, lifting its peak 13,612 feet above sea level.
In the east, this ridge of mountains sinks, and forms between Amecameca and Ozumba, a broad saddle, over which passes the railroad from the capital to the State of Morelos.
The eastern mountainous rim stretches itself as a mighty wall, separating the Valley of Anahuac from Pueblo.
It culminates in the southeast in the volcanic peak of Popocatepetl (17,782 feet), and in Iztaccihuatl a long high broken mountain mass, 16.060 feet elevation.
Contiguous to Iztaccihuatllying to the north, we find the continuous ranges called Cerro Telapon, Cerro Tlaloc, Cerro Tlamacas, Cerro Cha1 See an article by the writer in Bot.
Gazette, May, 1S98, p. 362.
1898.]
375 pingo and the small Sierra de Patlachique — to the east as an outlier in the Valley of Puebla, Monte de Rio Frio.
These are all of volcanic origin.
About the north foot of Cerro Tlamacas spread the the fruitful plains of Otumba and Apam.
The railroad to Vera Cruz crosses here.
The enclosure of the Valley of Mexico is completed to the west by the Sierra de las Cruces, continued northward by the spurs called Monte alto and Monte bajo, and ending finall}in the Sierra de Tepotzatlan and Cerro de Sincoque, separated from the northern range of hills by the railroad cut and drainage ditch, Tajo de Nochistongo.
The floor of the valley is generally level and uniform with six large lakes filling the more depressed portions.
Their size and elevation in metres and square kilometers is given in the subjoined table : Area.

The relative elevation, minus or plus, has been referred to the base of one of the corners of the National Palace on the Plaza Mayor, as the zero level.
During the diluvial period of geologic time the lakes were very much more extended than now.
The whole Valley of Mexico was filled by a large inland sea with here and there a volcanic hill rising, as an island, or as a peninsula, out of its surface.
Texcoco was in the past quite saline.
Fernando Cortez in a letter to Charles V, dated 1500, says : " En el dicho llano (del Valle de Mexico) hay dos lagunas, que casi lo ocupan todo.
E la una de estas lagunas es de aqua dulce, y la otra, que es mayor, es de aqua salada."
The earth of the plains surrounded Texcoco Lake is impregnated with salt, and in many places the saline material forms a rich efflorescence.
The flora of this region of the valley has a marked character.
Various species of Chenopodium, Atriplex, Salsola and Gratiola are found growing here as saline plants.
The chinampas are the so-called floating islands, more especially found in Lake Xochimilcho.
A number of small conical volcanoes rise from the floor of the valley, and are known locally as Cerro de taza (cupped hill, Kuppen).
One remarkable collection of these low hills is to be found in the neighborhood of the town of Guadalupe, separating the Valley of Mexico into a northern and southern portion.
These, the socalled Sierra de Guadalupe, are connected with the western mountain chain Monte bajo, by the low ridge Cuesta de Barrientos, and with the north-eastern ridges by the Cerro de Chiconautla.
The northern half of the valley thus formed is occupied by Lakes Zumpango, Xaltocan and San Cristobal, the southern half by the three lakes best known to travellers, Texcoco, Chalco and Xochimilcho.
A few words are necessary as to the geography, topography and geology of the region visited botanically.
Cerro de Tepeyac, one of the hills of the aforementioned Sierra de Guadalupe, is 140 ft. high ; very few plants are found on this hill.
If one ascends the east side, he finds for the first 115 ft. a fine crystalline rock of a dark violetgray color of a close texture frequently spotted with green, scaly, porous particles.
The summit of the hill is covered with a pitchstone-like rock formation about 16 to 26 ft. thick.
By a rocky bridge, Cerro de Tepeyac is connected with the Cerro Gachupines.
Felix and Lenk 2 say of this hill : " An dessen Abhang passirt man zunacbst zwei, 5 bezw.
8 m. machtige Pechsteinzonen, zwischen und uber welchen der rothlichgraue.kornige Andesit sich ausbreitet, der die Hauptmasse des Berges ausmacht und in einigen Steinbriichen zu industrielleu Zwecken abgebaut wird."
The ped regal of Tlalpam, or of San Angel is one of the most interesting formations in the valley, covering an area of about 7,000 acres.
The pedregal is an extinct lava stream situated between the towns of San Angel and Tlalpam, and extending southward up the sides of the Sierra del Ajusco to the hill called Chitle.
It was formed when the southern mountains were in active volcanic eruption.
The eye of the traveller sweeps unobstructedly over an arid black landscape, which might be compared to the sudden stiffening of the rolling surface of the sea.
The country is extremely uneven and rugged ; the coulee of lava is full of cracks, blisters, 2 1890.
Felix and Lenk, Beitrilge zur Geologie und PaUiontologie der Republik Mexico, I, 70. caverns and sinks produced during the process of cooling.
It is raised into cones, presents most curious sinuosities, and is here and there broken down into rugged jagged protuberances, as sharp and cutting as a knife's edge.
This interesting coulee is from 33 to 50 ft. thick over its greatest extent, and from 20 to 26 ft. thick along its borders: Felix and Lenk 3 give a very interesting and true description of this lava bed. "
Wogenberg erhebt sich neben Wogenthal ; hier ist die Lava glatt und mit einer glanzenden Erstarrungskruste uberzogen, dort ist sie, wie der Gischt der Welle, schaumig und schlackig.
Deutlich kann man beobachten, wie die erstarrte Oberfljiche haufig geborsten ist und auf den weitreichenden Rissen diinn fliissigere Lavamassen emporgequollen sind, die von den klaffenden Spaltenriindern machtige Blocke mitgerissen und nach kurzem Transport zu chaotischen Triimmerhaufen aufgestaut haben.
— Ausser kleinen, einst durch die Gasentwicklung in der Lavamasse entstandenen Hohlraumen, welche schliesslich zur kleinheit der Dampfpore herabsinken, finden sich stellenweise in ihr auch geraumige mehrere cubikmeter haltende Grotten, welche genetisch wohl als sogenannten ' Schlackensiicke ' zu betrachten sind.
Durch spateren der Einsturz Decken oder durch die bei Abkiihlungin Folge der eintretenden Contraction aufgerissenen Spalten sind sie zum Theilgeoffnet und bieten zahlreichen Fledermausen Wohnung, dem Reisenden bei einbrechendem Unwetter schiitzendes Obdach."
The lava of the Tlalpam pedregal is a typical hypersthene free basalt.
But that which concerns us mos.t are the plants, which together form a very rich and remarkable flora.
Among the causes which favored the development of this peculiar flora may be mentioned the soil temperature, which is warm and uniform, owing to the soil being a basaltic scoria in the protection of which a large number of herbaceous plants flourish ; the direction of the wind, the humidity of the atmosphere of this region also favor a rich plant growth.
The pedregal is surrounded by high hills, protected thus from the tempestuous winds of the north.
Woods of pine, oak and fir clothe the hillsides and serve as an additional protection.
In this region are found deep caiiadas, always damp and wet from abundant water, which comes from numerous showers and the spray of waterfalls which precipitate themselves from various heights.
As a result of these factors, the climate of the pedregal is more temper' 1890.
Felix and Lenk, 1. c, 79.
25 ate and more constant than that of the City of Mexico, or of the Hacienda de Eslava, where a meteorological station has been established.
In consequence of the meteorological conditions, the pedregal supports a flora made up of many representatives of the tierra fria, tierra templada and tierra caliente.
The Serrania de las Cruces is a continuation northwestward of the Sierra del Ajusco.
It is an elevated region, and by reason of that elevation and exposure to the winds of the north and west presents a very distinct flora.
One part of the region, that on the west flanks of the Serrania del Ajusco, is very humid ; the central portion is more dry.
Large forests of fir, Abies religiosa, once covered the western side, but these are fast disappearing before the axe of Mexican wood choppers.
The higher elevations present a characteristic alpine flora.
Many of the places with an eastern exposure are quite sterile, as to the abundance of plants found in such localities.

Closely similar to the water hyacinth Piaropus (Pontederia, Eichornia) speciosa Kunth, a native of South America.
Whether this plant is indigenous to the canals and lakes of the Valley of Mexico is a question ; at any rate it is very abundant in many of the ditches in the City of Mexico, and is also found abundantly floating about in Lake Xochimilcho.
The related Water Hyacinth is extremely troublesome to navigation in the rivers of Florida.

It shows a remarkable variation in color from cardinal of several shades, through scarlet, scarlet-orange, mandarin, orange, lemon-yellow, yellow.
The so-called scarlet-orange rays are scarlet with lines of yellow running through, so that the strap-shaped corolla has a somewhat banded appearance.
The ligulate corolla is about an inch long and half an inch broad.
The entire head varies in size from two inches in the cardinal ones to three inches in the scarlet-orange."

Senecio praecox DC, Prodr., VI, 431.
Senecio praecox is a composite plant inhabiting the volcanic beds in the Valley of Mexico.
It has a cylindrical stem rising three or four feet from the ground with clustered, deeply lobed leaves at the top.
The plant stores up an abundant supply of water in the pith, which is gradually used up during the dry season in Mexico, which lasts from October to June.
The flowers develop in April at the expense of the reserved supply of water.
Loss of water during the dry season is prevented by the fall of the leaves, and by the protective cork and balsam secreted in the exoand endocortex.
The water stored in the turgid discs of pith is gradually conducted by the woody cells and tracheids, which penetrate into the medulla by wedge shaped ingrowths, representing the primary bundles, to the growing point where it is used.
That this is the case, is shown by the dry parchment-like pith membranes, which were left in a piece of a stem which had remained in the dry state for over sixteen months.
Conduction of water in this stem was accomplished without the aid of root pressure, without any appreciable influence on the part of the small green leaves in drawing up the liquid by the pumping action of transpiration.

The pedregal near Tizapan presents the same rugged characters as elsewhere.
Along its edge, here, runs the small stream known as Rio Cherubusco.
The region shows the same profusion of flowering plants as elsewhere in the pedregal.

The pedregal, which here reaches its northern limit, is elevated 2,500-3,500 metres (8,000-11,800 feet).
The flora presents a greater richness than lower down, the region being protected from the cold winds, which blow over the valley, by the forests of oak and pine and by the high hills to the west and north.
It is, therefore, warmer.

North Mexico, region of San Luis Potosi, 6,000 to 8,000 feet (Parry & Palmer) ; South Mexico, Real de Monte (Coulter), summit of a mountain near Guadalupe (Bourgeau).
This dahlia is one of the showy species ; the color of its flowers runs from purple to pure white through the gradual fading out of the purple color.
One most commonly sees in a state of nature the white heads, which are tinted with lavender or pale purple at the base of the ray floret.
The heads in each case are nearly uniform in size, being about an inch and three-fourths across.

It is a most striking plant, growing from 5 to 6 feet tall, and bearing flowers ranging in color from purple to sulphuryellow through the following gradations: lavender-purple, heliotrope, heliotrope-yellow (various shades of lighter and lighter hue approaching yellow), sulphur-yellow.
The heads in which the ray florets are colored heliotrope-yellow, are in reality of an heliotrope color, the bases of the ligulate corolla being of a yellow color, shading off into heliotrope.
They are broad (1 inch), long (2 inches) and ovate spatulate.

La Cima.
Summit of Sierra del Ajusco.
La Cima is an Indian town 38 miles from the city of Mexico on the crest or summit of the Sierra del Ajusco at about 11,000 feet above sea level.
It is, therefore, about 2,000 feet lower than the Cerro Grande del Ajusco, or volcanic cone (13,612 feet).
It was from this extinct crater, that the great pedregal of Tlalpam and many of the smaller pedregals were formed by lava flows in prehistoric times.
The pedregal of La Cima is lower than the town, which consists of a few adobe huts.
It presents the same rugged features, as those of the great lava bed between San Angel and Tlalpam, which has been already fully described.
Most of the plants mentioned in the accompanying list are from the hill overlooking and directly above the town on the east side of the railroad.
The soil of this hill is of a rich black character and is marked by many foot paths running in every direction.

A brief description of this region is given in the introductory geographical portion.
The region is one of great exposure to trying and cold winds, we, therefore, find a more truely alpine flora than at La Cima, although the elevations are about the same.
This accounts for the presence at Salazar of low, cespitose, or dwarfed species.
A ditch along the railroad before reaching Salazar afforded many interesting plants.
Las Cruces Valley, the scene of the battle in 1810 between Hidalgo and the Spaniards resulting in a victory for the patriots, yielded a great variety of plants.
The level of the mountain meadows composing the valley is about 10,000 feet altitude.
Many cold springs, render the district fine botanizing ground.

Orizaba and Cordoba.
Orizaba (4,000 feet) and Cordoba (2,700 feet) on the line of the Mexican Railroad (Ferro-Carril Mexicano) can be treated of together.
Orizaba is a town of 15,000 inhabitants, 82 miles from Vera Cruz and 181 miles from the City of Mexico.
The town lies in a little valley surrounded by very fine mountains.
The peak of Orizaba, however, cannot be seen, save a tiny strip of glittering white over the crest of the Cerro de la Escamela.
The other surrounding hills are : the Barrego ; the Ranchito de Cristo ; Jalapilla ; San Juan del Rio ; the Rincon Grande ; and La Perla.
The town is composed, for the most part, of low houses with red-tiled roofs; it is crossed by two small streams, and by the little river Orizaba (through a rocky ravine filled with tropical plants), all of which unite near by in the River Blanco, which plunges over a precipice in a cascade in the Rincon Grande.
The valley alone was explored botanically during the short time at the disposal of the writer.
The several ravines were followed through the town to the outskirts, when circling the town, the fields and copses and woods were investigated for the plants that might be in flower.
Most of the larger trees were found to be loaded down with epiphytes, orchids, tillandsias, and mistletoe with several ferns.
To one who for the first time visits a tropical country, the very wealth of the material completely nonplusses him for a time.
The region abounds in orchids.
Only the smaller forms were collected although many fine large ones were seen.
A botanist is at once impressed with the luxuriance of the epiphytic growths.
A hasty visit was also paid to the Rincon Grande, where a number of plants were collected within the influence of the spray of the water-fall.
Only two hours were spent at Cordoba, between trains, so that only a most hasty and superficial collection of plants was made of the flora of this most interesting tropical region.

The pulp is generally cream colored or reddish, but varies in the many varieties which have arisen in culture, some of them bearing all the year round.
Propagation is easy from suckers, cuttings or seeds.
This big shrub is easily held under control in extra-tropic countries, but in the warmest and moistest tropical regions it may become irrepressible, as it spreads readily from suckers, and gets disseminated by birds and cattle easily."
