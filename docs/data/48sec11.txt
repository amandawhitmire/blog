CATALOGUE OF THE SPECIES OF CERION, WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW FORMS.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND E. G. VANATTA.
The genus Cerion, or as it is commonly known, Strop hia, is one of the most characteristic forms of West Indian land-molluscan life.
With two exceptions the species are all insular ; C. incanum and C. Antonii only, the former from South Florida Keys, the latter reported to be from Guiana, are continental.
The Greater Antilles — Cuba, Hayti and Porto Rico, with the Virgin Is, and the entire group of the Bahamas, are inhabited by numerous species, with a multitude of local races.
South of the larger islands named, if we include with Cuba the faunally dependent Cayman group and Isle of Pines, but one single species is found, C. uva of Curacoa, singularly isolated in characters as well as geographically.
Jamaica is without a species; and the genus also fails in the Caribbean chain.
In the main, each species is confined to some single island, or to a series of adjacent keys or islets ; but there are numerous exceptions, where forms unquestionably conspecific are found on several islands separated by considerable distances.
The species are subject to a remarkable range of individual and local variation.
Thus, many species vary from strongly and conspicuously ribbed to entirely ribless and smooth.
In fact this is a common variation, incontestably established by the series we have examined of Cerion dimidiatum, C. columna, C. regina, C. uva, C. maritimum, C. Sagraianum and many other species.
Color is equally variable, pure white species varying to heavily brown-mottled, and this not in one, but in many of the species.
Absolute size of adults is almost as mutable as in Cijprcea; and occasional individuals are abnormally shortened by the premature assumption of the features of maturity, giving them a stunted appearance.
All of these considerations render the study of the species one of unusual difficulty ; and the older authors, unacquainied with the protean nature of the species, as with the usually restricted range of each, often failed to properly discriminate them.
Thus, the several volumes of Pfeiflfer's Monographia HeliceorumViventium are unreliable in dealing with many species, especially in respect to geographic distribution.
An American writer on natural history, Mr. C. J. Maynard, some years ago begun the study of this genus, and to his earliest publication on the subject we owe the first clear statement of some facts of prime importance ; that the Cerions are excessively plastic, and locally modified into a considerable number of species and subspecies ; that the range of some of these forms is excessively limited ; and that former authors had failed to discriminate many really distinct species, " lumping" them under a few old names; and finally, that the aperture-armature, or " teeth " of the Cerions are variously arranged, and furnish ground for the division of the genus into several subgenera.
Mr. Maynard, moreover, has discovered and described a large number of most interesting species and varieties, especially the Cayman Island group ; so that his work on this genus has been an important one.
However, in our opinion he has unduly multiplied species and subspecies, basing them on characters we hold to be too slight and inconstant, and his work is marred by inaccuracies of all kinds " too numerous to mention."
Our object in preparing the present list has been primarily to place before students a moderate estimate of the species of the group, specific values being held neither in extremely narrow nor very wide limits, but practically in conformity with the views represented by the leading English and American conchological authors of today.
We have taken this occasion to place on record the results of a careful study of a very large collection of shells of the genus, a collection including numbers of shells which have been identified by Bland, Swift, Pfeiffer, Dohrn, Gruner and others, as well as accessions, considerable in the mass, from Messrs. H. D. Van Nostrand, S. Raymond Roberts, W. H. Dall, C. J. Maynard and others.
The soft anatomy of the Cerions is still but little known.
Dr. Leidy, the Cuvier of American Zoology, has given figures of the the anatomy of C. incanum Binn.^ W. G. Binney has figured jaw and teeth of the same species^ and C. J. Maynard has more recently published figures of the jaws and soft anatomy of a species from the Cayman Is.^ Leidy's figure unfortunately does not show the various systems of organs separately, and it is difiicult to interpret ^ Terrestrial Mollusks I, pi.

317 the confused masses and ducts of the generative and digestive tracts, shown crowded together.
It appears, however, that the long sperraatheca duct bears a diverticulum, and the vas deferens is of unusual length.
Maynard does not seem to have been fortunate in his preparations, and his figures afford no data of assistance to us.
The only species seen by us in the flesh is Cerion Yumaense P. & V. ;* the specimens examined being part of the type lot received from Mr. Henry Prime and corresponding to fig.
3 of pi.

The penis (p) is a moderately stout sack from the termination of which the short retractor springs.
Near the base of the penis the vas deferens (c. d.) enters ; and this is of extraordinary length as shown in the figure.
The spermatheca (sp.)
has a long duct, without branch or diverticulum ; and there is a large talon (t).
Ovotestis not observed.
A transverse section of penis-sack some distance above entrance of vas deferens shows a cavity with bipartite or dumb-bell shaped section, filled with a granular yellowish substance.
It will be seen that this diflPers from Leidy's figure in lacking the diverticulum of the spermatheca duct.
It agrees with it in showing a7i excessively long free portion of the vas deferens, inserted abnormally low on the penis ; and these will doubtless prove to be generic characters widely sundering Cerion from all other genera of which the genitalia are now known.
Subdivision of the Genus Cerion.
Four groups of subgeneric value may be distinguished by conchological characters.
Stropihiops only is known anatomically.
I. Axial and parietal folds wanting, Eostrophia.
II.
Axial fold in angle at root of columella ; no parietal fold, Cerion s. str.
III.
Axial and parietal folds present, the latter near middle of parietal wall, single and short, not over one-third of a whorl long, Strophiops.
IV.
Axial and parietal folds present, the latter very long and doubled, or short and interrupted, with an accessory denticle; rarely obsolete, Diacerion.
* The dissections and drawing are by Mr. Vanatta.
C Yumaense P. &V. The first and second of these groups consist, at present, of one species each.
Strophiops is by far the most numerous in species.
We are unable to make any subgeneric division into longand shorttoothed forms ; the various species present a perfectly graduated series.
Maynardia Dall and Loiujidens Maynard are, therefore, in our opinion, merely subordinate divisions oi Stroj^hioj'is.

There are two forms of C. Sagraiamim, one smooth (typical), the other with fine riblets ; but the distinction does not seem to be of subspecific value, being too variable in the series before us.
The cone of the spire is always minutely sculptured.
The intergradation of S: obscura Mayn.
