from the eyes of the Falco lagopus: he also communicated 

 the fact, that the bird lived at least an hour after it had re- 

 ceived a shot through the ventricles of the heart, allowing the 

 escape of blood; which fact was certain from the kind of 

 shot perforating the heart being of that size used at the first 

 fire only; the bird being brought to the ground by a subse- 

 quent discharge. 



Dr. -Goddard also made some remarks upon the anatomy 

 of this membrane, and the uses to which it is adapted.

 exchange of specimens. 



Verbal Communications. Professor Johnson made some 

 remarks in relation to the apparent tendency of Anthracite 

 coal to assume crystalline forms ; and exhibited a specimen 

 of the rhombic form. 



Professor H. D. Rogers observed, that in his explora- 

 tions of the coal formations of Pennsylvania, he found he 

 could trace this tendency to three mechanical causes, viz : 

 1st. to planes of deposition ; 2dly. to transverse planes or 

 joints ; 3dly. to faults. 



By special permission, Prof. Johnson in the chair, 

 Dr. S. G. Morton made some observations on a mode of ascer- 

 taining the internal capacity of the human cranium, by means of 

 the tin tube and graduated rod, as described by him in Crania 

 Americana, page 283. 



The materia] hitherto used by Dr. Morton for the purpose of 

 filling the crania, was white pepper seed, which was selected on 

 account of its spherical form, and the general uniformity in the size 

 of the grains ; in these respects, however, there is sufficient diversity 

 to occasion considerable variation in the results of several succes- 

 sive measurements of the same head, especially when taken by 



-.-..

8 [April, 1841. 



different persons. This variation was sometimes not less than 

 three or four cubic inches ; making it desirable to use some other 

 bodies in place of the pepper seeds. Dr. Morton then tried leaden 

 shot of the size called BB., measuring of an inch in diameter ; 

 which being perfectly smooth and spherical, of uniform size, and 

 therefore not liable, like the seeds, to variations from packing, were 

 found to answer the purpose in every particular. In using the shot, 

 it is necessary to fill the skull completely, by shaking it, and by 

 pressing the shot down with the finger and the end of the funnel 

 introduced into the foramen magnum, until all the cavities and 

 sinuosities are filled. When this is accomplished, the shot being 

 transferred to the tube, will give the capacity of the cranium in 

 cubic inches, and with so much accuracy, that in six successive 

 measurements of the same skull, the results did not vary more than 

 half a cubic inch ; a degree of accuracy which has not been at- 

 tained by any former method. An experiment with the apparatus 

 was then made, in the presence of the members, which corroborated 

 the statements already made. Dr. Morton informed the Society, 

 that he was now engaged in ascertaining by these means, the ca- 

 pacity of the cranium, as indicative of the size of the brain, in the 

 different races of men, and will report the results for publication in 

 the proceedings of the Academy.

Professor Johnson offered some observations on the me- 

 chanical structure of Coal, with evidences of the contempo- 

 raneous origin of its various kinds. 



The question of the identity and contemporaneousness of the 

 two great divisions of the coal measures of Pennsylvania, has 

 sometimes occupied the attention of geologists. A similar question 

 is occasionally agitated in Europe, in reference to the Anthracite 

 and Bituminous coal fields of that quarter of the world. 



Among the arguments in favour of the contemporaneous deposi- 

 tion of the coal in the two regions, those which are derived from 

 the similarity of the accompanying measures or members of the 

 coal series in the two regions, and the resemblance or identity of 

 the fossil organic remains accompanying the coal in both cases, are 

 not the least weighty. The presence of large bodies of carbonate 

 of iron interposed among the coal beds in both coal districts, is an 

 analogous circumstance strongly corroborative of the opinion that 

 both varieties of coal were produced under circumstances at least 

 strongly resembling each other. 



Another circumstance favourable to the supposed similarity of 

 circumstances which accompanied the deposition of anthracite and 

 bituminous coal, is the resemblance in mechanical structure of the 

 two kinds. This may, at the first enunciation, seem somewhat 



2 



i\

startling ; especially since the terms heavy, hard and tough, are 

 generally applied to the one, and light, soft and friable or tender, to 

 the other. It is nevertheless true, that strong mechanical resem- 

 blances exist ; and the more minutely we examine the two varieties, 

 the more shall we be impressed with the conviction of the import- 

 ance of the resemblance. 



In the first place, the coal of all coal measures has a series of 

 partings parallel to the floor or bottom of the bed on which it rests, 

 and to the cover or roofing under which it lies. These are as dis- 

 tinct in inclined and vertical beds as in those which still remain 

 horizontal. 



In the second place, the connection between the coal and its under- 

 lying slate, as well as with its top slate, is so definite and well under- 

 stood, that it serves to determine the true original position of coal 

 beds, which have been so far disturbed as to be turned nearly up- 

 side down ; of which examples are not wanting. These character- 

 istics are found in beds of both kinds of coal. 



In the third place, there is most commonly a fracture or division 

 of the coal in some direction (which, for the same bed, is gene- 

 rally continuous,) and nearly at right angles to the planes of de- 

 position. 



Fourth, a third series of divisions by vertical planes, called cross 

 partings, inclined to the last mentioned. This system of planes is 

 not always continuous throughout the bed, but varies in the differ- 

 ent plies. 



The principal vertical divisions are known to miners by the 

 names of "cleats" or " slines," and sometimes by that of "grains." 

 The direction in which these run, seems to determine the manner 

 of working out the coal ; for in attempting to separate large masses 

 from their natural position by means of wedges, it is only in the 

 direction of the cleats that the separation can take place. In in- 

 clined beds, from which the coal is to be extracted by a slope or 

 rail-road laid down on the floor of the bed, it is a great convenience 

 to have the cleat lie in a direction diametrically across that of the 

 slope, or in conformity with the strike of the bed ; for then in run- 

 ning a drift from the bottom of the slope horizontally along the bed, 

 and afterwards carrying the workings upward, the cleat will always 

 face the miner, and he will be enabled to obtain heavy falls of coal 

 by undermining and wedging down. 




April, 1841.] 11 



In most bituminous coals, and in not a few anthracites, the 

 "cleavage of the laminae," or what I have chosen to call surfaces 

 of deposition, are sufficiently distinct, and afford ready partings to 

 separate masses into small pieces. In some of the harder anthra- 

 cites, however, these surfaces are nearly obliterated, being dis- 

 tinguishable only by different shades of black. The actual cleava- 

 ges of the coal, in such instances, seldom take place along the sur- 

 face of deposition ; but on igniting the specimen, we may generally 

 obtain partings in those natural seams. I exhibit an example in 

 coal of Hazleton. 



The regular slines also, in anthracite, are sometimes so far ob- 

 literated as to be only developed by strong heat or partial combus- 

 tion. They are then shown by the thin, white, shining lamina? of 

 earthy matter, which mark two opposite sides of a lump of half 

 burnt coal. 



The absolute direction of the cleat is very various. At the Lau- 

 rel Hill mines, in Hazle creek valley, it is believed to be about 

 north 80 east. 



In some beds of coal which I discovered and examined on the 

 West Branch of the Susquehanna, it is due east and west by com- 

 pass. 



In the Middleton mine coal, in the Northerly part of England, it 

 is from N. 20 West to N. 32 W. 



The second, or " short cleat," in opposition to the " long cleat," 

 which extends for great distances, is the cross parting already 

 spoken of, and not unfrequently runs perpendicularly to the direc- 

 tions of both the " cleavage of the lamina? and to the long cleat." 

 This is seen both in bituminous coals and anthracites. 



Another circumstance to which I would refer, as indicative of the 

 similarity of origin and correspondence in character, between bi- 

 tuminous coals and anthracites, is the correspondence of the two, 

 in respect to the composition of the ashes of the two kinds. Silica, 

 alumina, oxide of iron, with small amounts of lime, magnesia, and 

 occasionally of oxide of manganese, are the ingredients of the ashes 

 of both the kinds of coal. The proportions vary, not only in the 

 different kinds of coal, but also in the several plies of the same bed, 

 both in the bituminous and anthracite districts. In the anthracite, 

 the diversity of composition is marked by the colour of the different 

 streaks after partial incineration. 




12 [April, 1S41- 



Another resemblance between the two kinds is that in the an- 

 thracite beds, spaces partially vacant are found to contain masses, 

 with a puffy aspect on the exterior, so strongly resembling coke, 

 that it might be difficult at the first glance to distinguish a fragment 

 of it from a piece of artificial coke. Natural coke is also found in 

 connection with beds of bituminous coal, especially where the latter 

 are in close proximity with primitive strata as in the mines of 

 Virginia. 



When coal contains a large proportion of earthy matter, and is 

 deposited in thin lamince, it will, in the state of anthracite, be found 

 to part with great difficulty in the direction of the surfaces of depo- 

 sition. It will then be seen to give fractures, developing a multi- 

 tude of small conchoidal surfaces, This is by the miners termed 

 bony coal ; and that it well deserves its name may be evinced by 

 its actually being so hard as sometimes to strike fire with steel. 



Coal occasionally assumes the appearance of well defined rhombic 

 prisms and octaedra, occasionally with striated surfaces, in which 

 cases, though the cleavages be difficult and obscure, they are never- 

 theless practicable.

May, 1S41.] 15 



Dr. Morton (Professor Johnson taking the chair) exhibited 

 the embalmed body of an Egyptian Ibis, Ibis religiosa, which 

 was unwrapped by him in the Hall of the Academy, on the 

 10th of April, in the presence of many members and others. 



This specimen was one of several sent to Dr. Morton by 

 George R. Gliddon, Esq., United States Consul at Cairo. It 

 was obtained at Saccara, and is probably two thousand five hun- 

 dred years old. The bird was enveloped in nearly one hundred 

 and fifty folds of the usual linen mummy-cloth, and was found to 

 be in perfect preservation; the head being extended downwards 

 between the legs, and the latter drawn up, with the toes pointing 

 outward: the feathers were generally uninjured, retaining much 

 of their original colour ; and it may be confidently asserted, that 

 this is one of the most perfect examples of the art of bird-embalm- 

 ing which has ever been submitted to the inspection of natu- 

 ralists. 



The Ibis, [Ibis religiosa,) as a sacred bird, was fed and wor- 

 shipped in the Egyptian temples ; yet it is difficult to imagine in 

 what way they were obtained in such vast numbers as are now 

 found embalmed in the pyramids of Saccara. For example, 

 Pococke, who travelled in Egypt upwards of a century since, 

 expressed a fear that the embalmed Ibis would soon become 

 extinct, in consequence of the daily and wanton destruction of 

 the jars in which they are embalmed ; and yet travellers of our 

 own times assure us, after all this protracted devastation, that 

 thousands of these relics remain undisturbed in the pyramids. 



The motive for worshipping the Ibis has been variously ex- 

 plained ; but the true cause was, no doubt, the appearance of this 

 bird (which is a native of Abyssinia) during the inundation of the 

 Nile, and its departure to the south on the subsidence of the 

 water; for the Egyptians rendered homage to every thing which 

 was connected with a phenomenon on which depended all their 

 hopes of health, plenty, and happiness. 



Dr. Morton adverted again to the fact, mentioned at a former 

 meeting, that on first opening one of these Ibis-jars, the wrappings, 

 which were beautifully adjusted, were almost, if not entirely 

 colourless; but that in a short time they assumed the dark brown 

 colour which the bitumen usually imparts to the mummy-cloth. 




16 [May, 1841. 



Prof. Johnson suggested that the exterior wrappings might not 

 have heen originally saturated with bitumen, but that they had 

 been applied while clean to the mummy wrapped in the interior 

 saturated folds ; and that by slow, insensible transmission, the 

 clean folds had, with the volatilized bituminous matter, become in 

 a manner photogenic, and capable of being turned yellow by the 

 influence of light as soon as the jars were opened. He con- 

 ceived this explanation of the phenomenon by the known agency 

 of light on resinous and bituminous substances, more satisfactory 

 than that which had been previously offered, and which ascribed 

 it to the mere presence of air admitted on opening the jar. He 

 suggested that the latter explanation Avouid have had more plau- 

 sibility if the jar had really been hermetically sealed, and air 

 tight; which,- from its texture, being that of coarse unglazed 

 earthenware, and particularly from the covering of its mouth 

 being a still more coarse unburnt mortar, could not be presumed 

 to be the fact. 



Dr. Goddard admitted the action of light, in explaining the 

 phenomenon in question ; but as he supposed the cloth to have 

 been originally of a yellow or brownish colour, such as it assumes 

 on being removed from the jar, he considered the presence of 

 bitumen not necessary to the change. He cited, in illustration, 

 the Cartoons of Raphael, which, having faded in a moderately 

 lighted room, were subsequently restored to their original colours 

 by exposure to the sun's rays. 



Some further observations ensued on the action of light, and 

 its effects in bleaching resins.

Written Communications. A communication was read 

 from Dr. A. Clapp, of New Albany, Indiana, in reference to 

 the Geological equivalents of that vicinity, as compared by him 

 with those described in the Silurian System of Murchison. 



" The following fossils, which characterize the Wenlock Lime- 

 stone of Murchison, I have found in the Limestone of the Falls of 

 the Ohio: Favosites spongites, Retepora prisca. Acervularia 

 Baltica, Astrea ananas? Cyathophyllum turbinatum, Syringipora 

 reticulata, Calymene bufo. 



"I have also observed, at the same place, the following group 

 of Wenlock fossils, which, however, are not characteristic of the 

 Limestone of the Falls : Catenipora escharoides, Syringipora 

 bifurcata, Stomatapora concentrica, Favosites C4othlandica, 

 Turbinalapsis bina, Strophomena euglypha? Atrypa prisca. 

 To Avhich I may add the following fossils of Goldfuss, which are 

 not found in the Wenlock Limestone, and some of them not even 

 in Wales: Cyathophyllum ceratites, C. vermiculare, and C. 

 helianthoides, Stomatopora polymorpha, Favosites polymorpha, 

 and F. basallica, Gorgonia infundibuliformis? the last being more 

 common in the latter formations. (Ludlow.) Besides the preced- 

 ing species, I have many Polyparia, and some shells of the Falls 

 Limestone yet undetermined. In the Limestone and Marls of 

 Madison and Hanover, in Indiana, I have identified two other 

 species belonging to the Wenlock shale, viz.: Terebratula 

 spherica? and Orthocera eccentrics. 



The middle and lower strata of the Blue Limestone and Marls 

 at Cincinnati, and the lowest at Madison and Hanover, appear to 

 be equivalents of the Caradoc Group of Murchison, and contain 

 the following fossils: Orthis callactis, Calymene punctata, C. 

 Blumenbachii, Triarthus Beckii, Isotelus , Pentacrinit.es prisca, 

 (Goldf.) This formation has very few Polyparia, but many 

 shells, which are different from any described by Goldfuss or 

 Murchison. 



" The black bituminous slate that overlies the limestone at the 




May, 1841.] 19 



foot of the Falls, and is found in many parts of the western coun- 

 try, is probably the equivalent of the Marcellus Shale of New 

 York. This is an excellent landmark, as there is no other for- 

 mation in the west that can be easily mistaken for it. The situation 

 of this slate at the Falls has been misunderstood in some instances, 

 and described as underlying, or beneath the limestone. 



"The dividing line between the upper and lower Silurian 

 groups, (Wenlock Shale and Caradoc rocks,) appears to have no 

 distinct lithological demarcation in our western formations; yet 

 this line will probably be found to occur in the upper series of 

 the Cincinnati and Madison Blue Limestones and Marls." 



Mr. T. A. Conrad submitted a description of three new 

 species of Unio, from the rivers of the United States, viz.: 



1. Unio perplicatus. Obtusely subovate, very ventricose; rather 

 thick, with about 12 oblique, profound plica?, those behind the 

 umbo recurved ; ligament margin greatly elevated ; posterior 

 superior margin slightly concave, oblique, extremity truncated ; 

 epidermis blackish-brown, apex erobed ; within tinged with 

 purple; cardinal teeth direct, prominent, sulcated. (Length 

 2.4; height 1.3; diameter 1.9.) 



This species is most nearly related to U. costatus, (Raf.) but 

 differs in being far more ventricose, and has very prominent urn- 

 bones, which are just the reverse in the costatus. The diameter 

 through the umbonial slope is profound. 



2. U. nodiferus. Obtusely subovate, ventricose, moderately 

 thick; surface with a few nodules about the middle of the 

 valves, and smaller ones near the ligament margin ; a slight, 

 not very wide, furrow extends from beak to base; posterior 

 margin approaching to a regular curve; beaks eroded; within 

 white ; cardinal teeth robust, prominent, direct, and profoundly 

 sulcated in old shells; epidermis chestnut-brown. (Length 

 2.1, 1.8; height 1.1, 1; diameter 1.6, 1.4.) 



Approaches U. prasinus, but differs in being proportionally 

 longer, more convex, in having a brown epidermis, narrower 

 anterior side, and oblique posterior margin. 




20 [May, 1841. 



3. U. paralellus. Oblong 1 , sub-rhomboidal, convex, moderately 



thick, slightly contracted from beak to base ; hinge and basal 



margins parallel, nearly rectilinear; posterior margin oblique; 



extremity obtusely rounded; epidermis dark olive-brown; 



within white; cardinal teeth oblique, double in each valve ; 



cardinal area under the beaks almost obliterated. (Length 



3.7; height 1.1; diameter 1.8.) 



Some' conchologists may consider this to be a variety of U. 

 purpureus, (Say,) and as but one specimen has been received, I 

 cannot judge of the amount of difference which will obtain be- 

 tween the two species. I think the purpureus has never yet 

 been found nearly so far south-west as Louisiana; certainly, 

 after a long examination of the waters of Alabama, I was unable 

 to find it. The paralellus differs from purpureus in having a 

 white interior, in the obliteration of the cardinal area, in the regular 

 convexity of the valves, and in having a much larger accessory 

 muscular impression. 



These three species are in the collection of the Academy: they 

 were sent from Jackson, in Louisiana.

The sample of coal, of which the following is a description? 

 was collected by Mr. J. F. Watson, of this city. 




22 [May, 1S41. 



In exterior appearance it is nearly related to many of the 

 richest bituminous coals of this country and of Europe. 



It is moderately compact ; thin shining lamina? are seen parallel 

 to the bed or plane of super position, but the greater part of the 

 mass is of a dull or pitchy black colour. 



Its horizontal or depository surfaces are rather uneven ; vertical 

 sections in some p^rts smooth, in others, irregular; very little 

 indication of reediness is perceived. Portions of "clod" or vege- 

 table charcoal are occasionally met with. 



Its specific gravity is 1.324. 

 At a temperature of 300 Fah. it loses of water 2.2 per ct. 



Coked at a bright red heat it gives off of volatile 



matter, burning with a brilliant flame, 27.8 " 



It contains of carbon, not volatile by simple heat, 67.62 " 

 And when fully incinerated, leaves of reddish grey 



ashes 2.33 " 



100. 



On being quickly exposed to a full red heat it becomes com- 

 pletely fused, and the original form and structure are entirely 

 lost. The coke accordingly belongs to that class which has 

 received the designation of "highly bituminous coal coke."

Written Communications. Mr. J. S. Phillips read descrip- 

 tions of two new American species of the genus Helix : viz. 



Helix Bidentifera. Testa convexa, depressa, corneo-lutea ; regu- 

 lariter et tenuiter striata, striis longitudinalibus, obliquis ; umbi- 

 licata, apertura compressa ; labro subreflexo, duobus dentibus 

 albis, rotundis, parvulis, in margine inferiore, instructo. 



Shell much depressed, rather thin, epidermis yellowish horn colour 

 shining ; whorls six, rounded, with very numerous, raised, oblique 

 striae ; suture strongly impressed ; aperture compressed, con- 

 tracted by a groove behind the outer lip ; outer lip moderately 

 reflected ; within the edge of the aperture on the lower portion, 

 two fine rounded white teeth, one near the umbilicus, the other 

 nearly equidistant from the extremities of the outer lip ; umbili- 

 cus round, of moderate diameter, not encroached on by the outer 

 lip, well defined and deep ; base rounded, more convex than the 




28 [J UNE , 1841. 



upper surface, transverse diameter 2-5 of an inch, height 1-6 of 

 an inch. Brought from North Carolina by Mr. T. Nuttall. 



This shell differs from all the known American Helices, in the 

 character of the two minute, well defined teeth on the outer lip, 

 while it is without a trace of a tooth on the pillar lip. 

 Helix lasmodon. Testa subelevata, centiculata, crassiuscula, urn- 

 bilicata, substriata ; apertura compressa ; labro acuto, uno vel 

 duobus dentibus lamellosis ; base rotundato ; colore albo corneo. 

 Shell moderately elevated, lenticular; rather thick; epidermispale 

 whitish horn colour, smooth, shining ; whorls eight, very faintly 

 and obliquely striated ; suture indistinct ; aperture compressed, 

 within a broad calcerous deposit, and one or two lameller teeth 

 following the direction of the whorls ; lip acute ; umbilicus mod- 

 erately large, rounded and deep ; base regularly rounded into the 

 umbilicus. Transverse diameter 7-20, height 3-20 of an inch. 

 Brought from Alabama by Dr. W. Blanding. 



This shell resembles no other American species but H. suppressa 

 Say, and H. gularis Say, and from these it differs decidedly in the 

 well defined and deep umbilicus ; it differs from H. Epistilium, in the 

 smaller size, greater number of whorls, large umbilicus and lentic- 

 ular form. 



Mr. T. A. Conrad read a paper descriptive of twenty-six 

 new species of Fossil shells, discovered by him in the Medial 

 Tertiary deposits of Calvert Cliffs, Maryland, viz. : 



Venus.

 spiral lines, and fine transverse striae, an impressed line below the 

 suture ; whirls carinated at base; suture deeply impressed ; pe- 

 riphery carinated, and margined above and beneath by a carinated 

 line ; umbilicus profound, crenate on the margin, and with a

 nated in size and minutely granulated by fine crowded concentric 

 lines crossing them ; foramen large, regularly oval. Length 1 

 inch.

Dispotaea ramosa. Suborbicular, with broad prominent ribs, and 

 radiating, ramose, wrinkled and highly ornamental striae ; mar- 

 gin profoundly indented by the projecting ribs. Width 1 3-8 inch.

 distinctly visible only on the body whirl ; a spiral line margins 

 the suture at base of each volution, causing the suture to appear 

 profound ; this line is continued on the middle of the body whirl. 

 Very distinct from B. terebellata,* the deeply impressed suture 

 and smaller umbilicus distinguish it at a glance. 



TuRRITELLA. 



Turritella indenta. Subulate, whirls about 15, contracted or in- 

 dented above the middle, and with obsolete spiral striae ; suture 

 profound, the lower margin obtusely carinated by the indenta- 

 tion ; the upper margin also subcarinated ; basal margin acutely 

 angulated ; base flat or slightly concave. Length 2 inches. 



T. exaltata. Subulute, profoundly elongated ; whirls convex, with 

 spiral striae ; base of each with a slight groove, and carinated 

 line which margins the suture ; waived longitudinal rugae robust. 

 Obtained only in fragments, but the spire tapers so gradually, 

 that the shell must have attained between 3 and 4 inches in 

 length by 1-2 inch in breadth. 



T. perlaqueata. Subulate, whirls convex at base, longitudinally 

 ribbed or fluted, with very fine spiral striae, most profound towards 

 the base of the large volution. Length rather more than 1-2 an

 minute, impressed radiating lines ; beaks central ; summits very 

 prominent ; posterior margin nearly direct, slightly emarginate ; 

 posterior slope with larger striae than the disk, and muricated 

 with radiating rows of approximate, rather obtuse, slender and 

 prominent tubercles. Length 2 1-2 inches. Height the same. 

 For this splendid Cardium, I am indebted to my distinguished 

 friend J. N. Nicollet. It was found in green clay at 50 feet in 

 height on the right bank of the Washita river, Monroe county, 

 Louisiana. 



Fusus. 



Fusus pachyleurus. Fusiform, thick, with spiral striae not very 

 distinct ; whirls of the spine concave above, convex, and with

 Alabama. 



Professor Johnson made some remarks on the magnetic 

 phenomena attending the congealing of cast-iron. 

 6 




34 [June, 1841. 



To observe the time and degree of rapidity of resuming the mag- 

 netic power by a mass of melted iron, a bed was formed about 3 or 

 3 1-2 feet in length, 5 inches deep, and of the usual form for cast- 

 ing pig iron ; rounding at the bottom and 4 or 5 inches broad at 

 the top. The length of this bed was nearly in the direction of the 

 magnetic meridian. 



A compass needle 3 inches long was placed near the northern 

 end of the bed, but a little to the east, and about 5 inches short of 

 the extremity ; another needle about 7-8 of an inch long, was placed 

 symetrically to the west side of the bed, and about the same dis- 

 tance from its southern extremity. Thus a line joining the centres 

 of the needles, would pass over the centre of the pig bed, and be 

 about nine or ten inches shorter than the latter. 



The needles having come to rest, and their positions been noted, 

 the bed was filled with melted iron. A slight derangement of the 

 needles occurred while the ladle was near, during the pouring of 

 the metal ; but they soon recovered their previous position, as 

 soon as the ladle had been removed. 



They were then carefully watched in order to detect the first 

 movements which should occur after the solidifying of the pig. 



At the end of 20 minutes the metal being cooled down to a heat 

 which made it barely red in daylight, the first movements were 

 detected, slow and scarcely perceptible, but increasing in rapidity so 

 that at the end of two minutes, the divergency amounted to 8 ; in 

 4 minutes it had extended to 20, the pig being nearly black ; and 

 in 20 minutes more, the divergency had attained its maximum of 

 22 from the original position. As the influence of the earth's 

 magnetism converted the northerly part of the pig into a north 

 pole, it of course repelled the north pole of the needle placed near 

 it, and attracted the south. The reverse taking place at the oppo- 

 site end of the pig, the north end was there attracted and the south 

 repelled. To ascertain whether any degree of permanent magnetic 

 force would be retained by the pig, it was thrown from its bed and 

 caused to make one-fourth of a revolution horizontally, so as to 

 bring its longest diameter into the magnetic east and west. In 

 this, position it exerted no power on the needle brought near either

extremity, but on reversing its position in the bed the end which 

 had before been a north pole was made a south one ; and vice versa . 



Dr. Morton made some remarks on the Ancient Peruvians ; 

 that extraordinary people who preceded the Inca race, and 

 whose monuments show a remarkable advance in civilization 

 at a very early epoch. 



" In my work on American skulls (Crania Americana,) I have 

 expressed the opinion that the heads of the ancient Peruvians were 

 naturally very much elongated ; and that they differed in this 

 respect from those of the Inca Peruvians, and other surrounding 

 nations ; and having given this opinion at a meeting of the Acade- 

 my prior to the publication of my work, I take this occasion to 

 renounce it. 



In the American Journal of Science, for March, 1840, I have 

 already, in a brief note, adverted to this change of opinion ; and I 

 now repeat my matured conclusions in connection with positive 

 facts, derived from the work of a distinguished traveller and natu- 

 ralist, M. Alcide D'Orbigny. 



This gentleman not only visited the elevated table-land of the 

 Andes, which was once inhabited by the ancient Peruvians, but he 

 remained a long time in that interesting region, and has collected 

 numerous facts in relation to the people themselves. 



1. The descendants of the ancient Peruvians yet inhabit the land 

 of their ancestors, and bear the name of Aymaras, which was pro- 

 bably their primitive designation. 



2. The modern Aymaras resemble the surrounding Quichua or 

 Peruvian nations, in colour, figure, features, expression, shape of 

 the head, (which they have ceased to mould into artificial forms,) 

 and in fact in every thing that relates to physical conformation and 

 social customs ; their languages differ, but even here there is a 

 resemblance which proves a common origin. 



3. On examining the tombs of the ancient Aymaras, in the envi- 

 rons of the lake Titicaca, M. D'Orbigny remarked that those which 

 contained the compressed and elongated skulls, contained also a 




36 [June, 1841. 



greater number that were not flattened ; whence he infers that the 

 deformity was not natural, or characteristic of the nation, but the 

 result of mechanical compression. 



4. It was also remarked that those skulls which were flattened 

 were uniformly those of men, while the heads of the women always 

 retained the natural shape, the squared or spheroidal form which is 

 characteristic of the American race, and especially of the Peruvians. 



5. The most elongated heads were found in the largest and finest 

 tombs ; showing that the deformity was a mark of distinction among 

 these people. 



6. The researches of M. D'Orbigny confirm the statements 

 made at distant intervals of time by Pedro de Cieza, Garcilaso de 

 la Vega, and Mr. Pentland, and prove conclusively, what I have 

 never doubted, that these people were the architects of their own 

 tombs and temples ; and not, as some suppose, intruders who had 

 usurped the civilization, and appropriated the ingenuity of an ante- 

 cedent and more intellectual race. 



M. D'Orbigny found temples from 100 to 200 metres in length, 

 facing the east, and ornamented with rows of angular columns ; 

 enormous gateways made of a single mass of rock, and covered 

 with bas reliefs ; colossal statues of basalt ; and large square tombs, 

 wholly above ground, and in such numbers that they are compared 

 to towns and villages. 



My published observations go to show that the internal capacity 

 of the cranium, as indicative of the size of the brain, is nearly the 

 same in the ancient and modern Peruvians, viz. about seventy-five 

 cubic inches, a smallness of size which is without a parallel among 

 existing nations, excepting only the Hindoos. 



M. D'Orbigny even supposes the ancient Peruvians to have been 

 the lineal progenitors of the Inca family; a question which is not 

 led Supposing this to be the fact, we may inquire how it 

 happens that the Incas should have so entirely abandoned the prac- 

 tice of distorting the cranium ; especially as this, among the Ayma- 

 ras, was an aristocratic privilege ? 



I was at first at a loss to imagine how this singular elongation of 

 the head was effected ; for when pressure is applied to a spheroidal

head, as in the instance of the Chenouks and other tribes of the 

 Columbia river, the skull expands laterally in proportion as it is 

 depressed above ; whereas, in these people, the head is narrow 

 from the face to the occiput. It seems probable that this con- 

 formation was produced by placing splints or compresses on each 

 side of the head- from the cheek bones to the parietal protube- 

 rances, and another on the forehead, and confining them by rotary 

 bandages. In this way the face, in the process of growth, would 

 be protruded in front, and the head elongated backwards; while the 

 skull, in all other directions, could expand comparatively little. 

 These remarks will be more readily understood by reference to 

 the annexed outlines, which are taken from a cast of one of the 

 skulls obtained by Mr. Pentland. 



Dr. Goddard suggested that the deformity observable in this 

 series of crania, might have been produced by the action of rotary 

 bandages alone, without the use of splints or compresses. Dr. 

 Morton admitted the possibility of this result in some of the heads, 

 but thought that in others there was satisfactory evidence of the 

 use of the splint or compress, especially on the os frontis. 




38 [June, 1841. 



Dr. Morton exhibited, in further illustration, six casts of heads 

 and three skulls of these people, all of which present the elongated 

 form in question. For further details Dr. Morton referred to his 

 Crania Americana, and to the beautiful and instructive work of M. 

 D'Orbigny, entitled " L'Homme Americain, considere sous ses 

 rapports physiologiques et moraux." These works were at the 

 same time placed on the table for inspection and comparison.

Verbal Communications. Mr. Clay remarked that on ex- 

 amining a series of magnesian minerals recently received by 

 him from Europe, he finds that four species which are describ- 

 ed as new, and perhaps a fifth, exist in the United States, 

 but do not appear to have been hitherto recognised by our 

 mineralogists. These species are Agalmatolite, Kerolite, Pic- 

 rosmine, Picrolite and Metaxite. (Breithaupt.) Mr. Clay thinks 

 that all these minerals (of which, however, he regards the 

 two last as doubtful species,) except Picrosmine, are found in 

 Chester and Delaware counties, Pennsylvania. Mr. Clay pro- 

 poses to investigate this subject more in detail. 



Dr. Blanding mentioned some facts in relation to the sur- 

 prising fecundity of the striped Bass, Labrax lineatus. He 

 obtained one of these fish which weighed 65 lbs. and the 

 roes 4 lb. 6 oz. 2 dr. He found one hundred of the eggs to 

 weigh a grain and a half; and although one end of the con- 

 taining membrane had been ruptured, whereby some hundreds 

 were lost, the whole number of eggs must have been at least 

 2,248,000.

Written Communications. Professor Johnson submitted 

 the result of his experiments " On the relation between the 

 coal of South Wales and that of some Pennsylvania anthra- 

 cites." 



Having received some time since a number of samples of the 

 coals used by Mr. Crane at the Yniscedwyn iron works in South 

 Wales, some pains have been taken to trace the relation of that 

 mineral to some of the many varieties of anthracite found in Penn- 

 sylvania. It was the first step in this inquiry to mark the relation 




June, 1841.] 41 



by external characters. These in the Welsh coal are, 1st. A struc- 

 ture often lamellated, and tending to separate on the surfaces of 

 deposition, owing to the quantity of carbonaceous clod which occu- 

 pies the dull seams between the bright plies of coal. 



2d. The abundance and width of the reeds constituting the char- 

 coal deposits. 



3d. The shining and polished surfaces occasionally presenting 

 themselves to view at some of the natural partings. 



4th. The purplish tints of metallic oxide often observable on the 

 surfaces of fracture. 



5th. The general colour is deep black, and either dull or shining 

 according as the ply which is examined belongs to the coal proper, 

 or to the carbonaceous clod partings of the seams. 



The next circumstance worthy of attention in tracing the relation 

 of coals, is their specific gravity; and this in the Welsh anthracite 

 is from 1.336 to 1.372, not greater than that of many bituminous 

 coals. 



The next circumstance worthy of attention is the quantity of 

 volatile matter, and this by the mean of two trials is 9.18 per cent.; 

 that on the anthracite containing most clod is 10.7, and that of the 

 more compact variety is 7.66 per cent. 



Mr. Mushet makes it from 6.66 to 7.80 in the coals of the same 

 locality. Mr. Frazer analyzed a sample of the same coal, and 

 found 7.60 of volatile matter, 86.6 of carbon, and 5.08 of ashes. 



The quantity of earthy matter in the Iniscedwyn anthracite, 

 according to the mean of 3 analyses of Mr. Mushet, is 3.578 per 

 cent. Adopting this for the proportion in the sample which yielded 

 10.7 per cent, of volatile matter, we have the solid carbon = 85.722 

 per cent, and in the other 88.762. 



Among the Pennsylvania anthracite, that which according to the 

 observations of Prof. Johnson approximates most nearly to the 

 Inyscedwyn coal, is the coal of Lyken's valley, situated in the 

 northwestern fork of the southern coal field. This coal has all the 

 exterior characters of the Welsh anthracite ; containing in many 

 samples a large portion of carbonaceous clod, with well marked

vegetable impressions; and in colour, structure, and varieties of sur- 

 face, the two coals might readily be taken the one for the other. 

 Of nine samples analyzed by Prof. Johnson, the lowest specific 

 gravity was found to be 1.374, the highest 1.416, and the mean 

 1.390. The mean amount of volatile matter was found to be 8.067, 

 the highest being 11.854 per cent. ; the mean proportion of earthy 

 matter and metallic oxides is 4.46 ; and that of the fixed carbon 

 87.472 per cent. 



From these data we derive the following comparisons.

In distilling the Welsh anthracite, the first portion of gas which 

 comes over, burns with a pale blue flame, like that of carbonic 

 oxide, which is succeeded at a certain point of temperature by a 

 sudden outburst of carburetted hydrogen, burning with a bright 

 flame and some smoke, a quantity of bituminous matter being at 

 the same time evolved ; sufficient in one instance to close up the 

 narrow beak of the retort employed in the distillation. The coke 

 is perfectly anthracitous, and the angles of the fragments entirely 

 sharp and well defined. 



The gaseous matter of the Lyken's valley anthracite also burns 

 with a brilliant flame, but no violent explosive development of it 

 was remarked. 



Professor Johnson made some remarks on the recent appli- 

 cation of Anthracite, to the smelting of the magnetic, iron ores 

 of New Jersey. 



This has been effected at Stanhope, on the line of the Morris 

 canal, 38 miles north-east of Easton, at which one furnace is now 




June, 1841.] 43 



in action ; another is nearly completed, a third is partly finished, 

 and the foundations of a fourth are prepared. 



The ore used at those furnaces is mined at Irondale, 7 miles 

 eastward of the works, on the line of the canal, and is found to 

 yield in practice 65 per cent, of pig metal of a lively grey colour, 

 soft, and easily wrought, though not remarkably tough. The an- 

 thracite hitherto used is that from the Lehigh, chiefly from the 

 middle coal pit, and according to their experience hitherto, a decid- 

 ed preference is given to the Beaver Meadow coal. The hot blast 

 is employed at a temperature of 600 degrees and upwards. The 

 quantity of coal required within the furnace to make one ton of 

 iron is 22 cwt. ; that for heating the blast, about 4 cwt. The air is 

 delivered to the furnace under a pressure of 3 lbs. to the square 

 inch. The amount of blast furnished by the engine is 4071 cubic 

 feet per minute ; which as the furnace makes 8 tons per day, gives 

 a little more than 25 tons of air urged through the bellows for every 

 ton of iron produced. But the air heating ovens are supposed to 

 receive about one tenth of this amount v and nearly an equal portion 

 is believed to be wasted through apertures in the tubes leading to 

 the engines. If this estimate be correct, the quantity of blast 

 actually delivered to the furnace will be 20 tons per ton of pig 

 metal produced ; a quantity corresponding with what has been 

 found necessary both from theory and from experience in other 

 anthracite furnaces.

June, 1841.] 45 



Verbal Communications. Dr. B. H. Coates stated, that out 

 of about 20 stalks of bearded wheat, which he had recently 

 examined in Moyamensing, and which were selected as not 

 having been able to develop their seeds, the greater part pre- 

 senting the appearance called smut, he found all but two to 

 have the aspect of having been stung by insects, in the first or 

 second joint, generally the first. In all but four, the resem- 

 blance of a sting appeared to penetrate the cavity of the straw, 

 and the inside had the appeara nee of having been eroded, with a 

 perforation extending to the outside. Opposite to two of these, 

 on the outside, and under the sheaths of the first and second 

 joints, he found puparia, resembling those of the familiar Ceci- 

 domyia of Say. One of these was empty ; and the separa- 

 tion of the leaf sheath from the stalk, with a black streak, 

 pointed out a route by which the animal could have escaped. 

 These cases last enumerated corresponded with the verbal 

 communications of Miss M. A. Morris. 



On the outside of another basal stipule of wheat, he found 

 two quiescent animal bodies, whitish, with dark spots, having 

 much of the general appearance of what is considered by Mr. 

 Say, the larva of the Cecidomyia. One of them in 24 hours 

 became of a pale brown and shrivelled ; and in two days more 

 developed a dipterous fly, which farmers said they should 

 have classed among the common destroyers of the wheat, 

 and which was exactly of the size of Say's figure, measuring 

 3-20ths of an inch in length ; but was of a paler colour, and 

 had setaceous antennse. Its general aspect resembled that of 

 a tipulide fly. After a partial inspection by a gentleman who 

 had bestowed much labour on Entomology, the impression was 

 received that it did not belong to the genus Cecidomyia; and 

 the specimen is kept for accurate examination. 



Professor Johnson drew the attention of the society to the 

 atmospheric phenomena attendant on extensive conflagration ; 

 and stated on the authority of Dr. H. King of Washington 




46 [June, 1841. 



city, that the burning of the prairies in Wisconsin and Mis- 

 souri, is frequently, and almost immediately followed by rain. 

 This observation had been confirmed to Dr. King by other 

 observers ; and in the western country it had become a popu- 

 lar impression that a prairie-fire was the forerunner of rain. 



Dr. Coates had met with a statement in Nichols's History 

 of Leicestershire, which bore on the same question; viz. that 

 in the reism of one of the Stuarts, orders were sent to a sheriff 

 of Staffordshire to discontinue the burning of Ferns during a 

 Royal progress, because the operation was usually followed by 

 rain. 



Mr. Phillips adverted to the memorable hail-storm which 

 occurred immediately after the last great fire at Constantino- 

 ple ; the fact being fully authenticated by Mr. Walsh and 

 Commodore Porter. That rain is common in South America 

 after the burning of the Pampas, is familiar to meteorologists ; 

 and the attention of the members is especially solicited to this 

 inquiry, in order that a more extended series of facts may be 

 collected and compared.

Written Communications. The Corresponding Secretary 

 read a letter from Mr. Benjamin Silliman, Jr., acknowledging 

 the receipt of a letter announcing his election as a correspond- 

 ing member. 



Verbal Communications. Dr. Morton (Prof. Johnson taking 

 the chair,) made the following communication. 



" I submit to the inspection of the members eight skulls of the 

 ancient Mexican race, for six of which 1 am indebted to Don J. 

 Gomez de la Cortina, and for the other two to Dr. John P. Macartney 

 of the city of Mexico. All these crania have been received since 

 the publication of my Crania Americana. 



The skulls are of the following nations. 

 1. Otomies. Four in number, with the high vertex, flat occiput, 




July, 1841.] 51 



great lateral diameter and broad faces, characteristic of the 

 American race. The Ottomies preceded the Tolticas, and were 

 the least cultivated of the demi-civilized nations of Anahuac. 

 The lam-est of these heads gives 92 cubic inches of internal 

 capacity ; the smallest, that of a female, only 67. 



2. Chechemecan. A single skull, of 83 cubic inches of internal 

 capacity. This nation followed the Toltecas in the possession of 

 Mexico in the 11th century of our era. They were nomades 

 and hunters, but rapidly acquired the arts and civilization of their 

 predecessors. 



3. Tlascalan. A single cranium. These people formed one of 

 the seven tribes who established themselves in Mexico during the 

 Chechemecan monarchy, and are renowned in history for their 

 warlike exploits. They are well known to have rendered Cortez 

 essential aid in taking the city of Mexico. This skull gives an 

 internal capacity of 84 cubic inches, and like the others of this 

 series, is remarkable for its diameter between the parietal bones. 



It is worthy of remark that the average internal capacity of these 

 six authentic Mexican skulls, is precisely what I have accorded to 

 these people in my Crania Americana, viz. seventy-nine cubic 

 inches. The mean of the facial angle also accords with my previous 

 measurements, and gives 75. 



All these heads were obtained from tumuli or mounds, within the 

 territories of the nations whose names they bear, so as to leave no 

 doubt in the mind of the distinguished gentleman from whom I 

 received them, of their having pertained to individuals of those 

 nations. 



The two remaining crania are supposed to be those of Aztecks, 

 who also belonged to the confederacy of the seven tribes, but were 

 the last to take possession. These were the people who subse- 

 quently obtained the supreme power, and under the name of Aztecs 

 or Mexicans, governed the country at the epoch of the Spanish inva- 

 sion, a. d. 1521. The Aztecks were a brave and intelligent people, 

 but remarkable for bloody rites, both in their warlike and religious 

 observances. They were less cultivated than the Toltecas, but 




52 [July, 1841. 



much more so than the surrounding barbarous tribes ; and appear, 

 in fact, to have been the connecting link between the two. The 

 largest of these heads gives 85 cubic inches of internal capacity ; 

 the smallest 77 ; the medium being 80 cubic inches. The configu- 

 ration of these heads is on the same model as the preceding series, 

 and the mean facial angle differs but a single degree. 



Whoever will be at the pains to compare this series of skulls 

 with those from the barbarous tribes, will, I think, agree that the 

 facts thus derived from organic characters, corroborate the position 

 I have long maintained, that all the American nations, excepting 

 the polar tribes, are of one race and one species, but of two great 

 families, which resemble each other in physical but differ in intel- 

 lectual character."

54 [July, 1841. 



A letter was read from Dr. Goheen, dated Monrovia, Africa, 

 April, 8, 1841. Dr. Goheen gives some interesting facts in 

 reference to the natural history of this region, and suggests the 

 importance of sending competent naturalists to explore its 

 numberless and extraordinary productions. 



A letter was also read from Professor John Locke, of Cin- 

 cinnati, Ohio, in answer to the announcement of his election 

 as a corresponding member. 



Verbal Communications. Mr. S. S. Haldeman communi- 

 cated the following facts in Ornithology. 



1. Falco peregrinus. It is asserted in the works on American 

 Ornithology, that this bird builds its nest on trees, and not 

 in the clefts of rocks, as in Europe. So far as my observa- 

 tions have gone, this remark is incorrect, inasmuch as they 

 build in the cliffs which border the Susquehanna. This 

 species remains in Pennsylvania ten or eleven months of the 

 year. 



2. Quiscalus versicolor. Mr. Swainsonin the " Menageries," 

 (p. 298 of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia.) describes the female of 

 this bird as a new species, under the name of Q. purpuratus. 

 I have shot the male and female together, carefully com- 

 pared them with his descriptions, and confidently assert, that 

 they belong to one and the same species. 



3. Anser hyperboreus. I have known but a single individual 

 of this species to occur on this part of the Susquehanna river, 

 (50 miles above tide water.) Wilson states that it is found 

 on the Delaware. 



4. Cygnus Americanus. Many flocks visited this part of the 

 Susquehanna about 15 years ago, during a continuance of 

 foggy weather, but they have not since appeared. 



Dr. Coates exhibited specimens of larva? from the hollow of 

 the straw of wheat, in the upper joint, obtained from a locality 

 near Germantown, in which they were stated to be numerous. 




July, 1841.] 55 



No pupa) were observed by the collectors of these specimens 

 in the same plants, other than those of the common appearance 

 ascribed to Say's insect, and near the roots. None other were 

 found in the present straw, after a careful examination. 



Other remarks were made, on the probability of several ani- 

 mals, not all yet identified, infesting the wheat in Pennsylva- 

 nia; on the beauty, learning and careful preparation of Mr. E.C. 

 Herrick's recent memoir ; on some interesting observations of 

 that gentleman ; on the effects of climate in varying the kinds 

 and diversity of destructive insects ; and on the influence 

 exerted by the age of the plant over the selection of a point of 

 deposit for eggs. 



Dr. Coates in addition to a former verbal communication, 

 had observed the following. 



Larvae apparently similar to those above mentioned, in 

 Blockley. 



A body nearly the size of Say's pupa, of a pure, homo- 

 geneous straw colour, immersed in a depression of the 

 straw, beneath a pupa of the appearance of Say's, and 

 having, lower down than either of them, a round perfora- 

 tion extending into the hollow of the straw, with this cavity 

 eroded on the inside ; all from the third joint. This body 

 subsequently assumed markings, having the appearance of 

 the separation of a head, cases for antennae, and other 

 organization. Though this appearance of development took 

 place, and the subject was kept from June 23d to July 9th, no 

 fly had as yet been produced. 



A very active larva, supposed to be of a lepidopterous ani- 

 mal, ll-20ths of an inch long, colour reddish black, with three 

 yellow streaks throughout its whole length, three anterior feet 

 clawed, and it is believed some of the posterior ; the animal 

 imperfectly observed from a wish to leave it but little disturbed. 

 Found in Blockley, June 23d, in the hollow of a wheat straw; 

 a round hole through which it could have entered, penetrating 

 the cell in which it was feeding, and also the leaf-sheath with- 




56 [July, 1841. 



out ; preferred its own cell to a fresh one ; devoured a part 

 which was quite dry ; about July 4th or 5th, closed the open- 

 ing of its cell with a mixture of dust of straw and a cement, 

 and besmeared it throughout great part of its extent with a 

 black substance ; remained quiescent and apparently feeble till 

 July 7th ; and between the 7th and 9th escaped, leaving a hole 

 of sufficient size for its passage in the paper cover of a bottle, 

 and no visible skin in its former abode.

 G. Anthony, in reference to the shells presented by him this 

 evening, with a proffer of further services. 



A letter was also read from Prof. Del Rio, of the city of 

 Mexico, enclosing a communication from Mr. Joseph Mur- 

 guitro, describing a new mode of mining and blasting rocks. 

 Referred to a committee consisting of Messrs. Chaloner, 

 Booth and Lukins. 



Dr. B. H. Coates stated that Miss Morris had seen a Tipu- 

 lide fly in the act of placing her eggs on or in a grain of 

 wheat. This fly and these eggs she had in good preservation. 

 On comparing it with Le Sueur's drawing, she could see no 

 difference, except that the antennae were not quite so long, and 

 that the small nerves of the wings were more clearly defined 

 and strongly marked. She had also found a flaxseed pupa in 

 the cavity of the straw, with no hole, crack or visible mark 

 where the larva could have entered. This pupa she has exa- 

 mined with a microscope, and she can detect no difference in 

 it from that on the outside. This too she has carefully pre- 

 served. 



These important facts and specimens may, in the conviction 

 of Miss M., either prove her previous views correct, or that 

 there are two species of this destructive pest. 



Mr. Phillips submitted the following memorandum, which 

 was read and ordered to be printed in the Society's proceed- 

 ings. 



In consequence of inquiries from different persons of the date of 

 publication of the papers in the early volumes of the journal of this 

 Institution, I have searched for the numbers as published with 

 their original envelopes, bearing the date of the month of publica- 

 tion, and have been so successful as to find a complete series. As 

 the covers of the numbers are thrown aside by the binder, and very 

 few sets of the journal remain in their original form, I have pre- 

 pared a list of the dates, in order that naturalists may be at no loss

in future to determine the claim of originality to descriptions of 

 species, by the rule now most generally admitted, viz. priority of the 

 date of publication. 



The date of publication of the monthly issues of the first volume 

 are printed in and bound up with the text.

60 [August, 1841. 



Written Communications. Miss M. A. Morris, of Ger- 

 mantown, Pennsylvania, through Dr. B. H.Coates, submitted 

 the following "Observations on the development of the Hes- 

 sian Fly," dated August 6, IS41. 



"Having completed a series of observations on an insect that 

 has for years destroyed the wheat in the neighbourhood of Phila- 

 delphia, I now beg leave to lay them before the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences, with specimens of the insect in all its forms, 

 from the egg to the perfect fly. To those familiar with Mr. Say's 

 description, accompanied by Mr. Le Sueur's accurate drawings, 

 given in the first volume of the Journal of the Academy, no doubt 

 can arise as to the identity of the male insect now presented with 

 the Cecidomyia destructor of Mr. Say; but the female differs 

 materially in colour, her body being entirely black or blackish- 

 brown ; and the wings are destitute of the hairy fringe so con- 

 spicuous in the male. 



In the months of March, April and May, I have frequently 

 found the larva? feeding in the centre of the straw, from the root 

 up to above the last joint. They were then of a pale greenish 

 white colour, translucent, with an internal visceral green line ; 

 mandibles of a dark brown colour. At this early period the larva? 

 have frequently been so small that a magnifying glass has been 

 necessary to detect them, 



In the present year, 1841, my observations were unavoidably 

 delayed until the first of June ; when I found that the larva? near 

 the root had left the inside of the straw, and become pupa? on the 

 outside, under the sheath. On the 20th of June, most of the 

 puparia were empty; and on agitating the wheat, swarms of flies 

 rose from off the grain, where they had been resting. I was for- 

 tunate in obtaining one of these while in the act of depositing her 

 egg on the grain. Thus interrupted, she placed six on my finger. 

 Three of these I have glued to the paper near her. When depo- 

 sited they were of a pale straw colour, and inconspicuous to the 

 naked eye, unless collected in numbers. On the same day, I found 




August, 1841. J G7 



larvae in the straw, generally above the last joint. They were 

 feeding in or near the joint, with their heads always downwards. 

 The wheat, which had to this time (June 20th) promised an 

 abundant harvest, began to shrivel ; and a practised eye could 

 detect, from the appearance of the grain, in which stalk we were 

 to look for the larvae. 



From June 20th to July 10th, the flies continued to deposit their 

 eggs on the grain ; though on the last mentioned date but few were 



DO O ' O 



to be met with. By July 12th, the grain in this neighbourhood 

 was all reaped ; and on that day I had a sheaf of wheat placed in 

 the library, where I could with more accuracy watch the progress 

 of the larvae remaining in the straw. They continued to feed for 

 some days; when they became quiescent, fixed, themselves by 

 their mandibles in the joint of the straw, and with their heads 

 downwards, gradually assumed a chesnut brown colour ; the outer 

 skin becoming the puparium. 



From a handful of infested straws placed under a bell glass, I 

 have the following results. Most have perished ; some have 

 passed into the pupa state in the centre of the culm ; a few of the 

 perfect insects I have liberated from the centre of the straw, by 

 opening a passage for them with my penknife ; and great numbers 

 have been destroyed by the Geraphion destructor ; two of which 

 I send with the Cecidomyia. 



From the sheaf of wheat I have the following results. Many of 

 the larvae perished ; some became pupa? without change of situa- 

 tion ; and the flies continued to rise from the straw until the 31st 

 of July. Of these I succeeded in catching twenty-six. Five are 

 Cecidomyias, and the remainder are Geraphion destructor; some 

 of which are destitute of wings. A small number of pupae are 

 still to be found in the field in the stubble. 



From this series of facts it might be presumed that the history of 

 this interesting and destructive insect was decided; but the state- 

 ments of observers whose information and accuracy cannot be ques- 

 tioned, prove discrepancies in its history that can only be reconciled 

 by supposing that there are two species under observation. The 

 species now presented will agree with Mr. Say's statement, that 




68 [August, 1841. 



" the perfect fly appears early in June, lives but a short time, 

 deposits its eggs and dies." The remainder of Mr. Say's history 

 must apply to that species which has been so frequently observed 

 to deposit its eggs on the leaf." 



A letter was read by the Corresponding Secretary from 

 Major James D. Graham, U. S. A., dated July 30, 1841, ten- 

 dering his acknowledgments for his election as a correspond- 

 ing member of the Academy.

Dr. Morton (Dr. Coates taking the chair) made some re- 

 marks on the sutures of the cranium as connected with the 

 growth of the corresponding bones. 



Headverted to the opinion long in vogue, that the chief use of the 

 sutures was to facilitate the process of parturition ; a theory which 

 is refuted by the fact that they exist in the skulls of all the ovipar- 




August, 1S41.] 60 



ous animals as strongly marked as in those of the viviparous 

 class. That they give a certain increased facility to parturition 

 is unquestionably true ; but their more uniform function is to sub- 

 serve the growth of bones, which they do by osseous deposition 

 at their margins ; hence a suture in the cranium is equivalent to 

 the surface which intervenes between the shaft and epiphysis of 

 a long bone. The latter grows in length by deposition at its ex- 

 tremities, and the epiphysis disappears, like the suture of the 

 cranium, when the growth of the bone is completed. 



Dr. Morton illustrated these views by means of the skull of a 

 mulatto boy who died when about eighteen years of age. In this 

 instance the sagittal suture is entirely wanting; in consequence of 

 which the lateral growth of the cranium has ceased in early in- 

 fancy, (no doubt when the suture became consolidated,) so that 

 the diameter between the parietal protuberances is less than 4.5 

 inches, instead of 5, which is about the negro average. The 

 squamous sutures, however, are fully open, whence the skull has 

 continued to expand in the upward direction until it has reached 

 the full vertical diameter of the negro, viz., 5.5 inches. The co- 

 ronal suture is also wanting, excepting some traces at its lower or 

 lateral extremities. The result of this deficiency is seen in the 

 very inadequate developement of the forehead, which is low and 

 narrow, but elongated below by means of the various craniofacial 

 sutures. The lambdoidal suture is complete, thus permitting of 

 posterior elongation ; and the growth in this direction, together 

 with the great vertical diameter already mentioned, has allowed 

 the brain to attain the bulk of seventy-seven cubic inches, or six 

 or eight inches short of the negro average- 



The growth of the brain and that of the skull are of course con- 

 sentaneous; nor is it probable, that either could be developed 

 without the sutures : hence there is reason to believe that the 

 absence of these may be a cause of idiocy, by preventing the 

 growth of the brain, and thus impairing or destroying its functions. 



Dr. Coates inclined to the opinion that, in cases similar to those 

 presented by Dr. Morton, the disappearance of the sutures was 

 rather to be regarded as a consequence than a cause ; and took 

 place, as in old age, because the necessity for further extension of 



10 




70 [August, 1841. 



growth no longer existed, from the final cessation of enlargement 

 in the brain. Uniting with Dr. Morton in the belief that the office 

 of the sutures was to permit a more rapid development and 

 growth of the cranium, by allowing ossification to go on from 

 several centres at the same time, the bones of the skull, in this 

 respect, resembling the trunk and epiphyses of a long bone, Dr. 

 Coates inclined, at the same time, to the double belief that growth 

 and other changes took place, not at the sutures only, but through- 

 out the whole extent of a living cranial bone. The parietal bone 

 of a newly born infant was not mathematically of the same shape 

 with the central portion of that of an adult. Were the brain, in 

 one of the cases referred to by Dr. Morton, to acquire, by any 

 means, a further enlargement, it ought to be presumed, in the 

 present state of our physiological knowledge, that the bone would 

 enlarge to a corresponding extent ; and it would be therefore, in- 

 ferred that the ossification of the sutures would not limit the 

 growth of the brain. 



This view Dr. Coates endeavoured to illustrate by a comparison 

 with the opinion of Mr. Serres, that the relative and successive 

 growth of the parts of the brain were a consequence of the relative 

 size of their arteries during the period of formation ; in regard to 

 which, he believed, physiologists were much agreed in the con- 

 clusion that the developement of a portion of the brain and of its 

 corresponding artery were coetaneous processes ; but that if any 

 priority in causation were to be allowed, it should be assigned to 

 the organ ; in consequence of the existence and comparative size 

 in outline of which, it became necessary, if the ability of the sys- 

 tem permitted, that a proportionate supply of blood should be 

 furnished to the part, through a vessel of a suitable size, in order 

 to aflbrd new materials for enlargement. Primary growth, he 

 imagined, took place in the interstitial substance, and that the 

 larger arterial branches, and even the capillaries were rather an 

 instrument or adjuvant than a cause. The formation of additions 

 to existing solids would thus resemble that of the primordiaof the 

 foetus, near which no vessels of the parent are observed, while the 

 vascular appearances are found to approach the newly organized 

 individual at a period subsequent to its formation. 




August, 1S41.] 71 



Dr. Coates called the attention of the Academy to the white- 

 ness, thinness, and semi-transparency of the specimen exhibited 

 by Dr. Morton, in all the lines usually exhibiting the sutures. This 

 he considered, not only as indicating the previous existence of 

 real sutures, but as corresponding with the views entertained, by 

 some late comparative anatomists, in regard to the analogy of 

 parts. He alluded to those who believe the analogous parts in 

 animal formations to exist to a very great extent indeed, although 

 composed of very diversified materials, and adapted to very dif- 

 ferent purposes in the various beings in which they exist.

Verbal Communications. 



Professor Johnson exhibited several specimens of crystalloid 

 anthracite and bituminous coal, and stated some of the circum- 

 stances which seem to determine the assumption by this mineral, 

 of certain figures, contrary to the assertion of many mineralogists 

 that it has no definite form. 



The forms which anthracite occasionally presents are, 1. Ovoid, 

 which causes it, in breaking, especially when the fracture takes 

 place from long exposure to the atmosphere, to fall into spheroidal 

 masses with salient portions strongly reminding us of truncated 

 angles in ordinary crystals. This figure has often been observed 

 in one of the beds of anthracite found on Beaver creek; and a large 

 specimen furnished by Mr. Jacob Thomas of Beaver Meadow, was 

 exhibited, showing the truncated borders along the lines of separa- 

 tion in a very remarkable manner, and also displaying beautiful 

 iridescent colours. It was remarked that coal affecting this form, 

 is frequently found to leave a considerable portion of oxide of 

 iron among its earthy residue; but that the whole of the latter 

 was not usually a large per centage of the coal. 



2. The next definite form mentioned as affected by coal, is a 

 radiated structure well characterized in several specimens from the 

 third bed, from the bottom of the formation at Bear-gap, Dauphin 

 county, Penna. This structure was likewise illustrated in a sample 

 of Welsh bituminous coal. The radiations generally proceed from 

 two points at no great distance from each other and forming two 

 sections of conical surface, unite at certain distances from their 

 points of departure into a single cylindrical section near the termi- 

 nation of the rays. The exterior of these radii is of a silky lustre, 

 striated, and sometimes interrupted by the interposition of frag- 

 ments of organic remains, in the state of fossil charcoal. Very 

 large stems are occasionally found with radiated, crystalloid an- 

 thracite adhering to the opposite sides, the directions of the 

 striae being on the two sides very nearly the same. 



3. The rhombic hexaedron was exhibited in a well marked 

 specimen of anthracite adhering to its accompanying slate. Few 

 mineral forms are better defined than this mass of anthracite. The 

 angles can be determined with the goniometer with tolerable pre- 

 cision, liable however to the slight uncertainty arising from the 

 presence of organic bodies, tending to oppose the crystalline ar- 

 rangement. 




74 [August, 1S41. 



4. An octahedron with tolerably well-defined faces striated in 

 different directions on the adjoining sides, was exhibited, and the 

 circumstance of possessing- a large portion of earthy matter was 

 noticed, as belonging to many samples of coal which exhibit this 

 exterior aspect. 



The presence of several well marked crystalloid forms being 

 thus established, Prof. Johnson adverted to the argument which 

 such forms had been supposed to furnish against the vegetable 

 origin of coal, and stated that in the very samples under examina- 

 tion were seen the most incontrovertible evidences of the source 

 from which not only bituminous coal, but anthracite also had been 

 derived. In one and the same specimen of the latter, were seen 

 mineral charcoal, natural coke, and true anthracite, indicating as 

 well the vegetable origin of all, as the process of formation, by 

 which the last two had probably been derived from the interme- 

 diate state of bituminous coal. 



In accounting for the supposed impossibility of crystalline struc- 

 tures being formed out of organic matter, he observed that a dis- 

 tinction is to be drawn between organic elements and organized 

 substances, and that the former may often be so proportioned, 

 when derived by distillation, fermentation or other chemical re- 

 action from the latter, as to be capable of assuming definite figures. 

 The production of coal from vegetable bodies is supposed, on all 

 hands, to have resulted from a slow chemical decomposition of 

 the latter and the establishment of new orders of affinity between 

 the original constituent atoms. The carbon as well as the other 

 materials of vegetables was by this process reduced, at least in 

 part, to the condition of ultimate molecules, instead of being 

 merely mechanically divided into small particles. It would there- 

 fore be capable of obeying any law of movement which either its 

 own affinities or those of the earthy constituents which had en- 

 tered into the composition of the vegetables fiom which it had 

 been derived, might tend to impress. That it is the earthy con- 

 stituents which determine the forms assumed by coal, seems pro- 

 bable from the fact that the more earthy residuum of a particular 

 kind any coal contains, the more prone does it appear to be to 

 assume a crystalloid structure. 



Reference was made, in this connexion, to those cubic, rhombic 

 and columnar structures which ofien occur in both anthracite and 

 bituminous coal, and which not unfrequently exhibit to the eye, 

 especially after partial incineration, the clearest evidence of a ten- 

 dency among the earthy ingredients to regulate the arrangement 

 of forms throughout the whole mass. Prof. Johnson also stated 

 that the result of a considerable number of analyses of the ashes of 

 coal, appeared to favour the presumption that the two principal con- 

 stituents, silica and alumina, are in definite proportion to each other, 




August, 1841.] 75 



and may therefore have a power of assuming definite forms. The 

 oxide of iron in the ashes is commonly derived from the decompo- 

 sition of pyrites, while the lime and magnesia in the coal are pro- 

 bably in the state of carbonates, unless where the production of 

 sulphuric acid by the decomposition of the pyrites has converted 

 the former into gypsum and the latter into epsom salt. From 

 this latter play of affinities the carbonate of iron would be produ- 

 ced, and subsequently the sesquioxide, often seen covering the in- 

 terstices of outcrop coal and forming bog ore in the springs which 

 proceed from coal seams, the coal in the meantime retaining the 

 form impressed by the agency of the silicate of alumina, and hav- 

 ing a portion of its interstices or those of the underlying slates 

 filled up with crystallized sulphate of lime. 



Admitting the justness of this view of the causes which produ- 

 ced crystalloid forms in coal, we have no more difficulty in ac- 

 counting for the number of different forms which it occasionally 

 exhibits than for the analogous variety in regard to other minerals ; 

 the carbonate of lime, for example, which, as is well known to 

 mineralogists, takes on a far greater number of distinct forms. 



Prof. Bailey stated, that he had recently examined specimens 

 of Calcareous marl from the cretaceous formation discovered by 

 J. N. Nicollet, Esq., on the Upper Missouri, above the mouth of 

 the Sioux river. These specimens proved to contain fossil Fora- 

 minifera, (Polythalamia of Ehrenberg,) similar to those previ- 

 ously detected by Prof. Bailey in the calcareous portions of the 

 same formation in New Jersey and Alabama. 



He also mentioned certain silicified wood found near Fredericks- 

 burg, Va., in the feldsphalhic sandstone, called by Prof. W. B. 

 Rogers " upper secondary sandstone." This wood is in a pecu- 

 liar state of preservation, the vegetable matter having been com- 

 pletely replaced by silica, without any filling up of the cells or 

 tubes. In consequence of this state of the wood, it is easy to 

 subject it to microscopic examination without the trouble and ex- 

 pense of forming polished slices. All that is required is to break 

 off thin pieces with the point of a knife and moisten them ; they 

 then show the most delicate markings of the tissue beautifully 

 preserved. The discs with concentric rings, and other characters 

 peculiar to Conifera, are so distinctly visible as to leave no doubt, 

 that this wood which is commonly called in Fredericksburg, 

 " Petrified hickory," is really fossil pine. In the same formation, 

 fossil plants of the family Cycadeas, have been detected.

Mr. S. S. Haldeman submited " Descriptions of two new

Amnicola attenuata. Shell very long and slender, with six 

 obliquely revolving, very convex turns, separated by a deep suture ; 

 aperture small, ovate, with the peritreme level and continuous, as 

 in Cyclostoma. Length A inch. Hab. a spring in Montgomery 

 Co. Virginia, connected with Roanoke river. 



Obs. Very like, but more slender than Cyclostoma lapidaria, 

 Say ; which I refer to this genus, as well as C. Cincinnatiensis, 

 Lea ; retaining for this species Mr. Anthony's specific name 

 Sayana, under which appellation the shells were distributed by 

 this gentleman. This substitution is necessary, because the pre- 

 viously described Paludina Cincinnatiensis, is an amnicola. Mela- 

 nia integra, Say, is an amnicola also. 



Physa globosa. Shell globose, translucent, spire very short and 

 rounded ; aperture very wide, occupying considerably more than 

 half the entire area of the shell ; fold well marked, whirls three. 

 Length i inch. Hab. mouth of Nolachucky river, attached to 

 submerged rocks, in the rapids. 




September, 1841.] 79 



Obs. This species is a valuable acquisition to Malacology, as it 

 enables us to place the genus Ancylus among the Limneans, where 

 it has hitherto held but a doubtful place. Any one who has exa- 

 mined the animal of Ancylus, cannot have failed to observe its 

 similarity to Planorbis ; and some authors assert that it ascends to 

 the surface of the water to breathe air. This I doubted, because 

 the species with which I am familiar, inhabit the interior of bivalve 

 shells, or the surface of stones in rapid water ; whence it is impos- 

 sible for them to rise to the surface, and regain their previous 

 position. I hence infer that they breathe water, as well as the 

 Physa above described, inhabiting as it does, the middle of a river, 

 in rapids nearly two feet deep at low water, and without objects 

 rising above the surface. It is highly probable that air-breathing 

 Ancyli exist; and it is even possible that the same organ may be 

 adapted to the respiration of both air and water.

"Description of two new species of Fossil Scutella, from 

 South Carolina, by Edmund Ravenel, M. D. 



" Scutella Caroliniana. Specific character : nearly round ; slight- 

 ly convex above ; posterior margin truncated ; ambulacra short, ellip- 

 tical, the two posterior slightly curved and nearly a third longer 

 than the others ; in a line with each there is an oblong perforation 

 extending almost to the margin ; between the two posterior ambu- 

 lacra, there is another perforation, longer than the others, and 

 more central, at the extremity of which, beneath, near the mouth, 

 is the vent. Mouth central ; diameter about six inches. 



Scutella macrophora. Specific character : sub-ovate thick ; 

 margin thick, truncated posteriorily , notched slightly opposite the 

 anterior ambulacrum ; more deeply, opposite the lateral, and still 

 more so opposite to the posterior ambulacra. Ambulacra elliptical ; 

 the posterior pair long, and gracefully curved, so as to give room 

 between them, for a very large irregular perforation, the margin 

 of which is considerably raised, extending to the centre of the 

 shell, giving the upper surface a remarkable elevation. The under 

 surface is flat, rather hollow, particularly near the opening ; mouth 

 anterior to the centre ; anus distant from the mouth one-fourth of 

 the space from the mouth to the posterior margin. 



Diameter of large specimens nearly four inches. 



These fine fossils are found in a calcareous deposite upon my 

 plantation on Cooper River, in St. Thomas's Parish, about 17 miles 

 from Charleston. 



The limestone is granular, and remarkably adapted to the pur- 

 poses of calcareous manure. 



In digging it out and spreading it on the fields, these fossils are 

 found in considerable numbers ; the S. macrophora is particularly 

 abundant and perfect. The S. Caroliniana is also abundant, but 

 from its size, and the number of openings in it, it is very easily 

 broken, and is only obtained in fragments. I have only one perfect 

 specimen and that is not quite 2} inches in diameter. 



In examining these fossils in the light, the surface exhibits 

 bright chrystalline faces ; the material of the shell seems to have 

 become crystallized, since the destruction of the animal matter. 




82 [Setpember, 1841. 



It is perhaps remarkable that many of the crustaceous remains 

 in this deposit are well preserved, while the shells proper are for 

 the most part decomposed. A few specimens of two or three spe- 

 cies of Pecten, of one or two Ostrese, a Plicatula and a Balanus, 

 are occasionally met with, while imperfect casts of numerous spe- 

 cies are very common." 



The calcareous deposit to which the preceding fossils belong, is 

 the newest cretaceous formation of Dr. Morton, who first described 

 its relative position and organic remains in his Synopsis, published 

 in 1834. Dr. M. supposed these beds to be of the same age of the 

 white chalk of Europe ; they are based on the ferruginous sand 

 strata in New Jersey, North and South Carolina, Alabama, &c. ; 

 and the two deposits contain a few fossils which are specifically the 

 same. In fact, the Eocene or lower tertiary, also embraces some 

 species of shells identical with those of the newer cretaceous ; 

 whence the latter beds, like those of the celebrated plateau of Maes- 

 tricht, may prove, as Dr. Mantell has suggested, to be a link 

 between the chalk and the tertiary beds, without being contem- 

 poraneous with either. 



Mr. Quinby made some remarks on the mineral resources 

 and physical geography of that portion of Peru which em- 

 braces the eastern ridges of the Andes. 



He alluded to the treasures which were secreted by the Peru- 

 vians at the epoch of the Spanish invasion, and which have never 

 yet been found, notwithstanding the continued search of the inhabi- 

 tants. But the river Chucabamba possesses natural treasures of great 

 value, for its sands are auriferous for several leagues above and 

 below the temple of the sun. The inhabitants procure it by cutting 

 the wool on sheep skins to half an inch in length, and then sinking 

 them in the rapids, and at the base of the falls of the river, in which 

 position the skins with the woolly side up, are suffered to remain 

 from six to twenty-four hours. They are then carefully removed 

 from the water, and turned wool side down into a batea or tub 

 of water ; the gold is thus washed out, and is collected without fur- 

 ther trouble. 




September, 1841.] 83 



Mr. Quinby adverted to the celebrated ruins of the Temple of the 

 Sun at Huanuco viejo, (Tiaguanico*) the Cyclopean fortress, tbe 

 walls composed of enormous masses of square and oblong stones of 

 marble, greenstone and greenstone-porphyry, all which, with their 

 bas reliefs and other ornaments, remain in a remarkable state of 

 preservation. These ruins, as is well known, date beyond the 

 dynasty of the Incas, to a people, however, of the same race, and 

 probably of nearly similar political and religious institutions. 



Mr. Quinby crossed and recrossed the Andes twenty-four times, 

 at seven or eight different passes ; twice from Naranjal, (on the 

 gulf of Guayaquil, one degree and a half south of the equator,) to 

 the city of Cuanca, the capital of the province of Assuay, a little 

 south of Chimborazo ; and having spent more than two weeks at 

 the foot of the Peak of Raura, at least a thousand feet above the 

 line of perpetual snow, he pronounces it the most sublime spot he 

 has visited on the Andean range. Besides the Peak of Raura, 

 which he believes to be at least as high as Chimborazo, there are 

 innumerable smaller ones rising on the range of the Cordilleras, to 

 the north and south, having their bases resting on perpetual snow, 

 and throwing up their snow-clad apices into the pure and attenuated 

 atmosphere, almost beyond the reach of the Condor itself. 



The largest and nearest of these peaks is that of Nueva Potosi, 

 the base of which approaches within one league of that of Raura ; 

 and the intervening space is occupied by the lake called also Neuva 

 Potosi, the surface of which is about 500 feet above the lower 

 limit of perpetual snow ; and as this line, within the tropics is not 

 less than 15,500 feet above the level of the ocean, the lake must 

 consequently have an elevation of 16,000 feet. The water of this 

 lake makes its escape by a subterranean passage on the western 

 slope of the Andes, and also gives rise to the river Haura, which 

 reaches the Pacific at Huacho, the celebrated salinas of the south- 

 ern hemisphere. Mr. Quinby also described the Lake of Raura, 

 one league north of that of Potosi, and giving rise to one of the 

 principal branches of the Amazon. Both of these lakes are the

frequent receptacles of avalanches of ice and snow from the super- 

 jacent mountains, presenting the rumbling sound and tremulous 

 sensation of an earthquake, and forcing vast bodies of water over 

 the precipice to make their way by the courses of the Amazon to 

 the Atlantic ocean, a distance of five thousand miles.

September, 1841.] 85 



Mr. J. S. Phillips read the following paper on the Nomen- 

 clature of Natural Science. 



The confusion in the nomenclature of Natural Science, owing to 

 the number of synonymes with which it is burthened, makes it 

 desirable that some fixed rule should prevail, by which naturalists 

 mio-ht determine to whom to credit species, and what names shall 

 have priority. With a view to call the attention of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences to the subject, I have thrown together some of 

 the opinions and arguments urged by different parties, in the hope 

 that eventually some definite rule in nomenclature may be generally 

 adopted. 



In determining the right to names of species, the only two points 

 worth noticing, are, which description was first read before a 

 society ; or, which was first printed and published. 



Now, the arguments that occur to me in favour of priority of 

 reading, are, that when the author has read his paper, and handed 

 it over to the society before which he read it, he has done all in 

 his power ; that it is then taken out of his hands, and he has no 

 control over the time when it is to be published ; and, that, because 

 his society, for whatever cause, delays the publication until another 

 naturalist has published it, it would be unfair that the former 

 should be deprived of the credit of his investigations, by circum- 

 stances over which he has no control, and that too, after having 

 done all that was in his power. 



Another reason urged in favour of the first read description is, 

 that in referring to old descriptions, the date when the paper was 

 read is precise the day when read being always one of the meet- 

 ings of the society, and printed in the journal or transactions with 

 the date, and therefore absolutely determined ; but the actual day 

 of publication not always so readily ascertained. In answer 

 to the first, it may be urged, that if merely reading a paper 

 secures the species, it will produce indifference as to whether it is 

 ever published or not ; and naturalists in general will be at a loss 

 *o know what has been done in the case ; while specimens will 

 remain unlabelled and unknown, because no one is particularly 

 interested in publication ; but if priority of publication be the stand- 

 12 




86 [September, 1841. 



ard, other naturalists would not be long at a loss to know what has 



been done ; and as the rest of the community interested are a vast 



majority, their convenience should have great weight in the matter. 



And when the meetings are not open to the public, the reading is 



still less a point to be depended upon, as the committee to whom 



the paper is referred might retain it for months, and in some cases 



years, and in the mean time numerous species be added to the 



paper through the carelessness or connivance of the committee, a 



long time after it was read, and perhaps after another naturalist 



had published them ; and thus if the first read be the rule, a great 



opportunity for trick and injustice be offered to the unscrupulous. 



And even when the meetings are public, the author might borrow 



the paper under pretext of verbal alteration or other excuse, and 



then interpolate additional species. The same objections in part 



hold good against the other argument in favour of the first read 



description : the correctness of the date of publication may be 



ascertained by all, but it is not so certain that the description of a 



species was read on a particular evening. 



The arguments in favour of priority of publication are, among 

 others, that it would be extremely unfair, that a man who has spent 

 months or years in searching for species abroad, and then perhaps 

 been at the expense of publishing them himself, should be deprived 

 of his hard-earned credit, by some one who has merely read a paper 

 of which the other could have no knowledge ; while, if he had known 

 that the Fauna or Flora of that district had been collected and des- 

 cribed, he would have made his researches in another quarter. 



Another reason is, that by making mere reading the standard, 

 all who were not present at the time, or had access to the minutes 

 of the society, might remain for a long time in ignorance ; especially 

 as a paper might not be recorded until reported on by the commit- 

 tee, who might retain it for years when the volumes appeared at 

 long intervals : even the members of the society who were absent 

 when the paper was read, would remain at a loss to know whether 

 any particular species were described or not. In this way the 

 numerous specimens which are constantly scattered through va- 

 rious collections would remain a long time undescribed and 




September, 1841. J 87 



unknown ; as the possessors would be always in doubt, whether 

 some one else had not previously described them without publish- 

 ing : and thus the keeping up with the state of any department of 

 natural history would be impossible, as no one could know what 

 was doing in more than one or two societies. In the case of 

 societies holding their meetings with closed doors, the reasoning 

 applies with still greater force, as none but the members of that 

 society could have the chance of any knowledge of the matter. 



There is also another reason for preferring priority of publica- 

 tion ; that many naturalists are working away quietly, exploring 

 sections of country around their places of residence, in remote and 

 unfrequented parts, who have no access to public institutions, and 

 whose only means of knowing what is done must be through the 

 press. 



The great number of synonymes with which natural science is 

 burthened, is in great part owing to the want of a fixed rule in this 

 matter ; and it would seem that priority of publication would lessen 

 the evil, more than the rule of having been first read ; as several des- 

 scriptions might be read within a short time of each other, in 

 different places, by parties in ignorance of what is doing elsewhere ; 

 and then their various names be introduced into the nomenclature ; 

 but when once published, it is every one's business to know what 

 has been described, as the opportunity is offered to every one to 

 ascertain ; and if a description be made in voluntary ignorance, it 

 then could not stand. 



And not among the least of the arguments in favour of priority 

 of publication, is, that of the two parties in the case, the describer, 

 and the public of naturalists who are to read the description, the 

 latter, being an immense majority, would find priority of publication 

 contribute greatly to the interest of science generally, in promoting 

 early publication, and preventing confusion by synonymy ; and to 

 individual convenience, in enabling those who choose, to keep close 

 up with the state of any branch of natural history. Now, as the 

 descriptions would not be written, if there were to be no readers, 

 the latter being so important a party in the matter, may take upon 

 themselves to decide what rule shall obtain in the premises. 




88 [Setpember, 1841. 



While on the subject of the nomenclature of natural history, 

 there is an evil which is growing so rapidly as to deserve notice; 



That is, the custom when genera are sub-divided, or species 

 transposed from one genus to another, to credit the old species to 

 the naturalist who constitutes the new, or even modifies the name of 

 an old genus ; thus depriving the original describer of his species, 

 because it is associated with another series of species, or because 

 the termination of its latin name be altered to suit the altered gender 

 of the genus. In this way Linneus has been robbed of a large 

 portion of his labours ; not by Lamarck, for he appears to have 

 been superior to such littleness ; but by later naturalists, who have 

 credited the old species of Linnaeus, to Lamarck as an authority 

 and precedent for their own innovations and appropriations. When 

 fairly viewed, it can hardly fail to strike every disinterested mind, 

 that the credit of the original description of a species should remain 

 with the describer; he described the characters of a group, a spe- 

 cies, and whether that species belongs to one or another genus, his 

 description of its character must remain : indeed there is no show 

 of any attempt to change such description ; and if in the progress 

 of science, new divisions of genera, or translations of species 

 from one genus to another be found necessary ; then credit the 

 generic change to the constitutor of the genus, and the species to 

 its original describer, thus Planorbis Corneus. Lin. Lam. This, 

 besides being strictly just to all parties, would have the effect of 

 preventing useless and absurd modifications, by removing one of 

 the chief incentives the having the name of the innovator tacked 

 to specific names. 



MEETING FOR BUSINESS, September 28, 1841. 



Dr. Goddard, in the Chair. 



The corresponding Secretary's report was read and adopted. 

 The committee on Mr. Haldeman's paper, " Description of 




September, 1841.] 89 



two new Freshwater Shells," reported in favour of publica- 

 tion. 



The committee on Dr. Ravenel's " Description of two new 

 fossil species of ScutellaV' reported in favour of publication. 



The committee on Mr. Speakman's memoir on Light and 

 Heat, reported in favour of depositing it in the library of the 

 Academy. 



The committee on Mr. Phillips's communication, read at 

 the last meeting, on the claim to priority in the description of 

 new species, submitted a report, which was ordered to be 

 printed with the proceedings of this meeting. 



The committee to whom was referred the consideration of the 

 views and suggestions of Mr. Phillips concerning the rights of 

 authors; and of the practice of changing original names to suit new 

 made nomenclatures, havingcarefully examined these interesting and 

 important matters, respectfully recommend the publication of Mr. 

 Phillips's communication in the bulletin of the proceedings of the 

 Academy ; and further, beg leave to submit to the Academy a few 

 brief remarks : 



In the opinion of your committee, the establishment of well- 

 defined, and readily understood principles, as bases of nomencla- 

 tures, especially as regards the priority of the rights of authors in 

 the history of nature, is most essential ; not only because it will 

 have a direct tendency to stimulate labourers in science to profound 

 investigation and research, and secure to them the harvest they 

 may achieve, and thence facilitate the acquisition of precise know- 

 ledge to all ; but it will likewise be eminently conservative of the 

 integrity and reputation of science itself amongst us. 



It appears to your committee to have been conclusively under- 

 stood by many naturalists, from precedents established in scientific 

 institutions both in Europe and in this country by usage, if not by 

 written law ; that the date of a printed publication, accessible to all, 

 to men of science as well as to others, announcing new discoveries, 



shall fix and determine the right of priority; and hence names and 

 13 




90 [September, 1841. 



descriptions thus put forth, are entitled to and should receive the 

 sanction, and be adopted, throughout the scientific world. 



In contradistinction to this, your committee are aware that there 

 exists an opinion, that an author might claim precedence, from the 

 time his discoveries were read before a scientific society, and with- 

 out reference at all to the time of printing or general circulation. 

 But this seems to your committee, a very uncertain and vague expe- 

 dient, the source of perpetual embarrassment and confusion; and much 

 of the retardation of the spread of knowledge maybe attributed to this 

 cause. Many societies issue their transactions through the press at 

 long intervals, months, even years, elapse before their discoveries 

 reach the public : thus, it seems to your committee, manifestly 

 unjust, that other collaborators should await such tardy enunciations 

 of scientific knowledge, and so hazard the loss of their labour, and 

 that too, by acts, even farther removed from their control, than are 

 the periods, or the means of publication of the transactions of such 

 societies, from the influence of their own members. 



Your committee deem it inexpedient at this time to extend their 

 observations ; enough, in their opinion, having been adduced to 

 warrant their conclusion that the most obvious and rational cri- 

 terion by which to test the merits of conflicting claims to originality, 

 is solely, the printed and published testimony. 



In relation to that portion of Mr. Phillips's communication, 

 which alludes to the modifications and changes in the designation of 

 genera and species made in new nomenclatures, without assigning 

 credit, where it is justly merited, thus wresting from the natu- 

 ralist the honour acquired by his oftentimes onerous and unrequited 

 toil, your committee trust, that the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia, will sustain them in an expression of decided dis- 

 approbation of a practice, so fraught with evil, doing injury alike 

 to science, and to its collaborators.

Mountain Bat. Smaller than Say's Bat, (V. subulatus ;) ears shorter : 

 tragus less than half the length of the ear ; colour yellowish brown. 



Upper fore-teeth bilobate, ears moderate, naked, erect, rather broad at 

 base; tragus linear, subulate, body small ; wings long; tail projecting, a 

 line beyond the interfemoral membrane, which is slightly sprinkled with 

 hair above and beneath. 



Colour. The nose and chin are black ; ears, light brown; wing mem- 

 branes, dark brown. The whole of the fur of the body, above and beneath, 

 is from the roots of an uniform yellowish-brown colour. 



This species differs from Say's Bat, not only in colour, but in its much 

 shorter ears and tragus. The size and shape of the tragus, we have found 

 an infallible guide in our American Bats; the ears of the present species, 

 when alive, are always erect, whilst those of Say's Bat are folded backwards 

 like those of the long eared Bats Plecotus.

 and more pointed ; upper fore teeth simple ; interfemoral membrane naked ; 

 sooty, brown above, ash brown beneath.

In size, this species is intermediate between Vespertilio Carolinensis, and 

 V. subulatus. The ear is naked, less rounded, and more pointed than either 

 of the other closely-allied species. The tragus is very narrow, linear, and 

 less than half the length of the ear. The tail is enclosed in the interfemoral 

 membrane, except the penultimate joint, which is free. The anterior upper 

 fore teeth, instead of being sub-simple, as in the (V. Carolinensis) or bilo- 

 bate, as in Ves. subulatus and Ves. montanus, are simple. 



Colour. The nose, upper lip and under-jaw are black; wings dark 

 brown. The back is sooty brown ; on each shoulder, at the insertion of 

 the wing, there is a circular black spot about four lines in diameter; on 

 the under surface, cinereous brown.

Remarks. Say's Bat (Ves. subulatus) has been several times described. 

 It was first observed by Say, at the head waters of the Arkansas, within 

 sight of the Rocky Mountains. It was subsequently described by Richard- 

 son, who obtained it at the Saskatchewan It was given by Le Conte, in 

 McMurtrie's translation of Cuvier, under the name of Ves. Lucifugus. Pro- 

 fessor Green, in Doughty's Cabinet of Natural History, (vol. 2, fig. 270,) 

 gave a correct description of it under the name of Ves. domesticus. He, 

 however, erred in arranging it in the preface of his descriptions, under 

 Rafinesque's genus Nycticejus, to which it does not belong. The last notice 

 of it is found in Cooper's Monograph of Vespertilio, in the New York Lyceum 

 of Natural History. This species has a very extensive range. We obtained 

 it in the widely separated localities of Carolina and Labrador, during sum- 

 mer. The Ves. Carolinensis is found in autumn, winter and spring, in 

 Carolina; but appears to migrate northwardly in summer, and is at that 

 season common in the State of New York. The Ves. monticola and Ves. 

 Virginianus have not been met in Carolina or Georgia, and appear to be 

 Northern or Alpine species, and no doubt exist in the Northern States. The 

 Ves. Carolinensis may be easily distinguished from the other closely-allied 

 species, by the large size of the first upper incisor; the second which suc- 

 ceeds it being so minute as to require the aid of a good magnifier to detect it. 



The genera of Bats have within the last few years been greatly multiplied, 

 in order to include the vast number of new species which have been accu-

ruulating in European museums. The last revision we have seen was by 

 Gray, of the British Museum, who has divided the bats into forty-eight 

 genera. The two species here described, belong to the genus Vespertilio, 

 as now restricted. It is characterised by having four incisors in the upper 

 jaw, in pairs on each side, near the canines, with a large, unoccupied space 

 between them. The only species as yet described in the United States, that 

 can be referred to this genus, are Ves. Carolinensis, Ves. noctivagans, Ves. 

 subulatus, Ves. monticola and Ves. Virginianus. 



The existence of a Brown Weasel in America, which does not become 

 white in winter, has been doubted by some naturalists; and by others, the 

 species has been regarded as the Mustela vulgaris of Europe. Dr. Harlan, 

 (Fauna Americana, p. 61,) under the name of Mustela vulgaris, does not 

 appear to have described an American species. His description appears in- 

 tended for the common Weasel of Europe, which we think does not exist in 

 America. Dr. Godman, after giving figures of the Ermine, both in winter 

 and summer colours, considered the latter as the species improperly referred 

 to Mustela vulgaris of Europe ; and in accordance with the views of Charles 

 L. Buonaparte, the Ermine was regarded as the only species of American 

 Weasel. Dr. Richardson, (Fauna B>reali Americana,) under the name of 

 Mustela (Putorius) vulgaris, has described from specimens obtained by 

 Captain Bayfield on the borders of Lake Superior, and also from others 

 procured by himself at Carleton House, which he regarded as agreeing in 

 all respects with the European species. He concludes, by stating, that this 

 species, like the Ermine, "becomes white in winter." We had an oppor- 

 tunity, in the Museum of the Zoological Society of London, of examining the 

 specimens referred to by Dr. Richardson, and of comparing them with Mus- 

 tela vulgaris, and were satisfied that the species were distinct; yet, unless 

 he was in error in stating that the American species became whire in winter, 

 we are not certain that the species we are about to describe is identical 

 with the specimens he referred to. 



Mustela fusca. American Brown Weasel. 



M. (fusca). Corpore inter Mustelam erminiam et Mustelam vulgarem in- 

 termedio ; cauda illius breviore, sed hujus longiore; apice nigro; vellere 

 supra fusco ; subtus albo. 



American Brown Weasel. Intermediate in size between Mustela erminia 

 and Mustela vulgaris ; tail shorter than the former, but longer than the 

 latter, with the extremity black ; brown above, white beneath. 



The body is long and slender, but far more robust than that of Mustela 

 vulgaris ; the feet especially appear one-third larger, and mure thickly 

 clothed with fur, which completely covers the nails. The ear is a little 

 longer, and more pointed, than that of either the Ermine or common Weasel. 

 The white on the lower surface is not mixed with brown hairs, a3 in the 

 Mustela vulgaris, and not only occupies a broader space on the belly, but 

 extends along the inner surface of the thighs as low as the tarsus, whilst in 

 the Mustela vulgaris, the white scarcely reaches the thighs. 



Colour. The whole of the upper surface, to within three-fourths of an 

 inch of the tail, is of an uniform dark fawn colour. On the upper surface 

 of the tail, the hair is darker brown than the back, and its extremity is for 

 an inch nearly as black as that of the Ermine. In writing this description, 

 we have several specimens of the European Mustela vulgaris before us; and 

 the ends of the tails in that species are uniformly brown, with here and 

 there a black hair interspersed. Although the hair of the present species, 

 at the extremity of the tail, is black, like that of the Ermine, yet these hairs 

 are short and soft, and more like fur, and do not present the long and 

 coarse appearance of that of the former species. The whole of the 

 under surface is pure white; this colour does not commence on the 

 upper lip, as in the Ermine, but on the chin, extending around the 

 ^Tes of the mouth, and by a well-defined line, along the neck, inner

parts of the fore legs, the sides and the thighs, and tapering off to a point 

 at the tarsus. The white on the lower surface is not mixed with brown 

 hairs, as in the Mustela vulgaris, but extends lower down on the legs. Of 

 the colour of this species, in winter, we cannot speak with positive certain- 

 ty, but feel pretty confident that it is the same as in summer, and that it 

 does not (at least in the latitude of New York) become white in winter. 

 We, many years ago, kept several young Ermines in confinement, as well as 

 one of this species. The Ermines all became white in winter, although some 

 of them were not fully grown ; the present species underwent no change in 

 colour, but remained brown during the whole winter. On another occa- 

 sion, a specimen of a brown Weasel was brought to us in the month of 

 December, which had been caught in a trap. At that season, the Ermines 

 are uniformly white. A Weasel exists in the Southern States, and is found 

 as far south as the upper parts of South Carolina and Georgia. It has 

 always been represented to us as never becoming white in winter ; and 

 although we possess no specimens at present, we are inclined to regard it 

 as this species.

The specimen of the American Brown Weasel, described above, was ob- 

 tained at Long Island, in the month of May. 



We subjoin a description of another species of Mustela, which, although 

 recently made known to naturalists by Dr. Lichtenstein, of Berlin, who re- 

 ceived his specimens from the vicinity of the city of Mexico, was not 

 hitherto known to exist as far north as the locality from which we ob- 

 tained it. We agree with Swainson, Lichtenstein, Dr. Richardson, and 

 the most eminent European naturalists, that America divides itself into 

 three natural zoological boundaries : the first including our whole coun- 

 try from the farthest north, to the tropic of Cancer, where the tropical 

 forms commence, to be called North America ; the second, including the 

 Tropics, called Central or Tropical America; the third, South America, 

 including all that region lying south of 33 J south latitude. The southern 

 points of Florida and California will, in this case, be the southern bound- 

 ary of our North American Fauna. Our specimen was received from North 

 California about latitude 40.

Bridled Weasel. Size of Mustela erminia; colour, fawn above, yellow- 

 ish white beneath ; ears and nose dark brown ; a spot on the head, a band 

 above the eyes, and the throat white. 



Form. In shape, this species bears a strong resemblance to that of the 

 Ermine. It appears to be somewhat shorter. The toes and nails are more 

 thinly clothed with fur; the ears are narrower and longer. 



Colour. The nose, sides of the face to above the eyes, and the ears are 

 dark brown: end of the tail black; a small spot on the head, between the 

 ears; the forehead, abroad line extending beneath the ears; the chin and 

 the throat white. The whole upper surface is a light fawn colour ; be- 

 neath, yellowish white.

A. (fulva.) Corpore longo ac tenui ; naso acuto; auriculis et pedibus 

 longis ; velleri tereti ac nitente ; supra fusca ; subtus cano-fusco. 



Glossy Arvicola. Body long and slender, nose sharp, ears and legs 

 long, fur smooth and lustrous ; dark brown above, hoary brown beneath. 



Form. This species presents more distinctive markings than any of our 

 American Arvicola ; its body is less cylindrical, and its nose less obtuse 

 than any of our other species; its ears are prominent, rising two lines 

 above its smooth, compact fur; its lower incisors are very long, and much 

 exposed and considerably curved; tail longer than the head, thinly cov- 

 ered with short hairs ; legs long and slender, giving the whole animal that 

 appearance of lightness and agility observable in the Mouse. 



Colour. Incisors, yellowish-white. The hairs, which are very short, 

 like those on the Pine Mouse of Le Conte, are at the roots on the upper 

 surface, plumbeous, broadly tipped with brown, giving it a bright chest- 

 nut-brown colour ; the hairs, on the legs and toes, are a little lighter ; on 

 the under surface, the colour is cinereous.

 subtus ex cinereo et flavo variegato. 



Sharp-nosed Arvicola. Larger than Arvicola Pennsylvanica ; tail 

 shorter than the head; legs small, slender; heel very short ; the body, 

 above, dark, rusty brown ; a soiled yellowish grey beneath. 



The head of this species is rather long, and the nose sharper than the 

 Arvicola in general. The lower incisors are long, and very much curved. 

 The body is less cylindrical than Wilson's Meadow-mouse ; the ears are 

 circular, sparingly hairy within and well covered with fur exteriorly; 

 whiskers shorter than the head ; tail thinly clothed with hair. 



Extremities. Legs covered with short hairs. The fore feet have naked 

 palms ; claws small. The tarsus is more than a third shorter than that 

 of the much-smaller Arvicola Pennsylvanica ; the fur on the back is also 

 shorter. 



Colour. Incisors yellowish-white ; the fur, from the roots to near the 

 tips, is greyish-black; the tips are yellowish-brown and black; giving it 

 a rusty-brown appearance. The legs and tail are light brown ; the chin 

 a soiled white ; the fur on the under surface of the body, is dark-cinereous 

 to the tips, where it is light-coloured.

though not described, by Rafinesque, in the American Monthly Magazine, 

 under the name of Lemmus Noveboracensis. His descriptions, however, 

 in every department of natural history, are so short, vague and imperfect, 

 that it is impossible to identify his species with any degree of certainty. 

 They have created such confusion in the nomenclature, that nearly all 

 European and American naturalists have ceased to quote him as authority. 

 Dr. Richardson has, moreover, described an Arvicola from the Rocky 

 Mountains, which he has referred to the Noveboracensis of Rafinesque, 

 which differs widely from the above species. 



Habitat. The specimen which we have described was obtained by Dr. 

 Brewer, near Boston. We received another from Mr. John W. Audubon, 

 who procured it at the Falls of Niagara. We have also frequently found 

 it in the northern parts of New York, where the Arvicola Pennsylvanica 

 also exists. It appears, however, not to be found as far to the south as 

 the latter species, as we have sought for it in vain in Pennsylvania. 



Arvicola scalopsoides. Mole Arvicola. 



A. (Scalopsoides.) Capite crasso ; naso obtuso ; vellere curio, molli, 

 bombycino instar velleri Talpre ; supra albo-fusco ; subtus plumbeous. 



Head large, nose blunt, fur short, soft, silky and lustrous, like that of 

 the Mole. Colour, above, light brown ; beneath, plumbeous. 



This species, of which we have obtained many specimens from Long Is- 

 land, and which is not rare in the vicinity of New York, is very distinct 

 from Wilson's Meadow Mouse. His diminutive figure in the 6th vol of his 

 Ornithology, is not very unlike this animal ; but his descriptions, both of 

 form and habits, which apply very correctly to Arvicola Pennsylvanica, 

 have no reference to the present species. 



The head is thicker and much shorter than that of Wilson's Meadow 

 Mouse; the body cylindrical ; ears scarcely rising above the integument, 

 and completely concealed by the fur. The legs and tail are short ; the lat- 

 ter not as long as the head, and both are covered with very fine and short 

 hairs. The fur on the back, which is soft and fine, and not half the length 

 of Wilson's Meadow Mouse, has none of the coarse hairs which are found 

 in that species. On the under surface, the fur is very short, not more than 

 a line in length. 



Colour. The teeth are yellowish white; the fur on the back is, from the 

 roots, dark plumbeous, tipt with light ashy brown. This colour continues 

 uniform till it reaches the sides, where there is a distinct line of demarca- 

 tion, commencing at the chin and running along the neck and sides of the 

 thighs. The whole of this under-surface is of a light cinereous colour, the 

 hair being plumbeous at base, and so lightly tipt with white as to appear 

 in some parts spotted with dark blue and ashy white. 



This species bears a strong resemblance to the Pine Mouse of Le Conte 

 (Psavnpmys Pinetorum,) which is also an Arvicola, than to any other. It 

 is, however, larger, differs considerably in colour, and is destitute of the 

 chestnut brown on the cheeks, which are the characteristic marks of that 

 species.

Reddish gray above ; cheeks, and line along the side, light ferruginous. 



Incisors, y Canines, -jg Molars, ^ j 16 Teeth. 



Form. Size about a third smaller than the house mouse. Head rather 

 broad ; eyes moderate, placed much forward ; nose much pointed ; ears 

 broad, extending a little beyond the hair, slightly furred without and along 

 the edges on the inner surface; legs short; whiskers reaching to the ears ; 

 tail a little shorter than the body, flattened on the sides, rounded above 

 and beneath, covered with a thin coat of very short hairs. Legs clothed 

 with soft hairs lying close and smooth. The fore feet have naked palms, 

 and four toes with a callous skin, protected by a very minute nail in place 

 of a thumb. The outer toe considerably shorter than the inner, the two 

 middle ones are nearly equal, the claws are slightly hooked ; soles of the 

 hind feet naked. 



Colour. Teeth yellow. Fur on the back plumbeous at the roots and 

 tinged with black and reddish gray at the tips ; cheeks, and a line along 

 the sides, light ferruginous. Under parts very light buff. Tail brownish 

 drab above, a little lighter beneath, nails white ; eyes black. 



This little quadruped, the smallest of the genus at present known in our 

 country, has been obtained in several localities in South Carolina, and ap- 

 pears to be sparingly diffused throughout the whole State, except in the 

 mountainous districts. It is occasionally found in the vicinity of Charles- 

 ton, generally in grassy and shrubby fields, especially in the waste lands 

 covered with the brome grass (Andropogon dipitiflorus, ) of this country, 

 as also in the fields of crab grass, (Digitaria sanguinalis.) I have occa- 

 sionally found its nest among the long grass on the surface of the eartli 

 formed of the withered blades of various species of grasses, sometimes con- 

 taining a small store of the seeds of the several species of Paspalum, Digi- 

 taria and Panicum, especially of the Panicum Italicum. The specimen 

 from which this description was taken, was a little the largest of a great 

 number that I have at different times examined. It was a female, procured 

 on the 10th of December, containing four young in its matrix. I presume, 

 therefore, that they produce their young throughout a great portion of the 

 year, and are very prolific. One which 1 kept in confinement for several 

 months, refused animal food of every kind, and fed only on grains.

Mus (Calomys) aureolus. Orange Coloured Mouse. 



Mus (aureolus) Auriculis longis ; cauda corpore curtiore ; corpore supra

Mouse with long ears ; tail shorter than the body ; bright orange co- 

 loured above, light buff beneath. 



Form. This species bears a general resemblance in form to the white- 

 footed mouse. (Mus leuocpus.) It is, however, a little larger, and its ears 

 rather shorter. Head long, nose sharp, whiskers extending beyond the 

 ears. Fur very soft and lustrous. The legs, feet and heel clothed with 

 short, closely adpressed hairs, which extend beyond the nails. Ears thinly 

 covered with hair, which does not entirely conceal the colour of the skin. 

 Mammae four, situated far back. 



Colour. The head, ears, and whole upper surface is of a bright orange 

 colour; the fur being for three-fourths of its length from the roots, dark 

 plumbeous. Whiskers nearly all black, with a few white hairs intersper- 

 sed ; tail above and beneath dark brown. On the under parts, the throat, 

 breast, and inner surface of the forelegs are white ; the belly light buff. 

 There are no very distinct lines of separation between these colours.

In symmetry of form and brightness of colour, this is the prettiest spe- 

 cies of Mas inhabiting our country. It is at the same time a great climber. 

 We have only observed it in a state of nature in three instances, in the oak 

 forests of South Carolina. It ran up the tall trees with great agility, and 

 on one occasion concealed itself in a hole, (which apparently contained its 

 nest,) at least thirty feet from the ground. The specimen we have descri- 

 bed was shot from the extreme branches of an oak in the dusk of the even- 

 ing where it was busily engaged among the acorns. It is a rare species in 

 Carolina, but appears to be more common in Georgia, as we received from 

 Maj. Le Conte, three specimens obtained in the latter State. 



Note. We have arranged this species under the sub-genus of Mr. Water- 

 house, proposed in the Zoological Society of London, Feb. 17th, 1837. (See 

 Transactions.) It is thus characterized. "Subgenus Calomys (from K*aoc 

 beautiful, and Mus.) Fur moderate, soft. Tarsus almost entirely clothed 

 beneath with hair. Front molar with three indentations of enamel on the 

 inner side, and two on the outer ; and the last molar with one on each 

 side. The type, Mus (calomys,) bimaculatus. Two other species have 

 been described from South America. Mus (calomys) elegans and graci- 

 lipes." 



Arctomys fiaviventer Yellow-bellied Marmot. 



Arctomys (fiaviventer.) Corpore supra flaveo subalbicante et nigro ;

Yellow bellied Marmot. 



Upper parts, grizzled yellowish white and black ; crown of the head 

 chiefly black ; under parts, deep yellow ; sides of the muzzle, yellow ; point 

 of the nose, tips and chin, white; feet, brownish yellow; tail blackish- 

 brown, all of the hair tipt with brownish yellow. 



The fur on the back is greyish-black at the base ; on each hair there is 

 then a considerable space occupied by dirty yellowish-white, which is 

 gradually shaded towards the apex through brown into black ; tips of the 

 hairs yellowish-white ; hairs of the belly, greyish-black at the base ; hairs 

 of feet, many of them blackish at base ; cheeks, grizzled black and white ; 

 the former colour prevailing: a rusty brown patch on the throat, borders 

 the white hairs of the chin; whiskers moderate black; feet entirely naked 

 beneath. 



This species is closely allied to the Arctomys empetra, which exists in 

 the northern part of our continent; but the feet are yellow, instead of 

 black, as in that animal; and the belly is yellow, instead of deep rusty- 

 red; aud the colouring of the hairs on the back consists of yellowish- 

 white and black, instead of rusty brown, black and white. The head is 

 narrower, the toes are smaller, and claws only half the length of the Arcto- 

 mys empetra.

Woolly Squirrel. 



Hair long and woolly ; tail, large and bushy, scarcely distichous ; nose, 

 ears and feet, nearly black ; upper surface, grizzled dark grey and brown ; 

 under parts, pale brown. 



Form. In size, this species is little less than the Fox squirrel, (Sciurus 

 capitratus.) The ears, in the two specimens which are before us, are de- 

 cumbent at the ends, as if the animal, in a living state, did not carry them 

 erect, as is the case with the squirrels generally; head short, ears large, 

 thickly clothed on both surfaces with short hairs ; feet and toes hairy to 

 the extremity of the nails. 



Colour. The incisors are dark orange on the outer surface. The whole 

 head, both on the upper and lower surface extending to the neck the ears, 

 a spot behind the auricle, fore legs to the shoulders, and hind feet to above 

 the heel, black, with a few greyish-brown hairs intermixed. The long fur 

 on the back is, for half the length, light plumbeous, then a line of light 

 brown, and tipt with white and black. The hairs on the tail, in which the 

 annulations are very obscure, are, for one-third of their length, brownish- 

 black, then light brown, then brownish-black, and tipt with ashy white. 

 On the under surface, the hairs, which are short, are at the base light 

 plumbeous, tipt with light brown and black; the throat is light greyish- 

 brown. 



The two specimens, which in other respects were very similar, differ a 

 little in the colour of the head ; one being lighter coloured, the head being 

 dark grevish-brown.

Form. The usually long neck of this specie9, together with its long and 

 slender body, and smooth, lustrous hair, give it the appearance of some 

 species of weasel, which has suggested to us the specific name. The ears, 

 which are of moderate size, are nearly naked, there being only a few hairs 

 on the borders; feet covered with very short hairs, which only reach to the 

 roots of the nails. The tail, which is long, but not busby, is moderately 

 distichous. 



Colour. The hairs, in every part of the body, are from the roots to the 

 extremities, of an intense glossy black.

 its thin covering of hair, nearly destitute of the soft fur usually found in 

 the squirrel, of being a native of a warm climate. 



Remarks. This species differs widely from all the other varieties and 

 species of Black Squirrel in our country. It is destitute of the white nose 

 and ears of Sc. capistratus ; it has shorter and coarser hair than Sc. niger, 

 with none of the white tnfts invariably found in that species; and has a 

 smaller body, although a much longer tail, than Se. Auduboni, with none 

 of the white, yellow and brown annulations in the hair, which characterize 

 that species. 



Scixtrvb ferniginiventris. Rust-bellied Squirrel. 



S. (/erruginiventris.) Vellere supra ex albo-cinereo vario, subtus rufo ; 

 armis fuscis. 



Rust-bellied Squirrel. 



Light grey above, reddish-brown on the shoulders; beneath, bright 

 rufous. 



Form. This species, which is a little smaller than the Carolina Grey 

 Squirrel, possesses great symmetry of form, and, in shape, resembles the 

 latter species. The ears on both surfaces are thinly clothed with hair ; tail 

 longer than the body. 



Colour Teeth yellow; nails brown ; point of nose and whiskers, black; 



ears, on the outer edges, tinged with brown; within, grey; behind the 

 ears, on the neck, a line of soiled white. On the upper surface, the head, 

 neck, back and tail are light grey, formed by hairs which are light plum- 

 beous, from the roots to near the tips, where they have white and black 

 annulations; from the outer surface of the fore legs, there is a reddish- 

 brown wash, which extends over the shoulders, and nearly meets on the 

 back, gradually fading into the colours of the back and neck. The hairs 

 of the tail are black at the roots, then yellowish, then a broad line of black, 

 tipt with white. The feet, on the upper surface, are grizzled with white 

 and black. The sides of the face and chin are light grey. The whole of 

 the remainder of the under surface of the body, including a line around 

 the eyes, the throat and inner surface of the legs, is of an uniform bright 

 rufous colour.

Form. Intermediate in size between Sc. cinereous and Sc. leucotis ; ears 

 moderate, thinly covered with very short hairs on both surfaces ; tail 

 longer than the body. 



Colour. Teeth orange; whiskers black; nose dark brown; ears light 

 brown. Above the ears, a tuft of soft, cottony-like fur. The hairs on the 

 back, which are short, are cinereous at the roots, then light brown, tipt 

 with brown and black, giving it so much the colour of the English Hare, 

 that we concluded to borrow from it our specific name. On the sides, the

colour is a shade lighter than on the back. The tail, which from the broad 

 white tips of the hair has a white appearance, is brown at the roots, and 

 three times annulated with black. The upper lips, chin, neck and 

 under-surface, including the inner surface of the legs , white; the 

 hair being of this colour from the roots ; feet, a soiled yellowish white. On 

 the outer surface of the hind leg, above the heel, a small portion of the fur 

 is brown. There is also a spot of the same colour on the upper surface of 

 the hind foot.

 This species, in its general appearance, so much resembles some varieties 

 of the Sc. cinereous and Sc. leucotis, that, had it not been for its distant 

 western locality, we should at first have been tempted to set it down, with- 

 out further examination, as one or other of those species. There can, how- 

 ever, be no doubt, from its differing in so many details of colour, of its 

 being distinct from either. 



Habitat. Northern parts of California. 



Sciurus molli-pilosus. Soft-haired Squirrel. 



S. molli-pilosus. Cauda corpore curtiore ; dorso fusca; lateribus et 

 colli partibus rufis ; abdomine cinereo. 



Soft-haired Squirrel. 



Tail shorter than the body ; back dark brown; sides of the neck and 

 flanks rufous; under surface, cinereous. 



Form. This species is a little larger than Sciurus Hudsonicus, with which 

 we have compared it; its legs especially are considerably longer and more 

 robust; the fur is much softer, the hair longer and less glossy than that of 

 the former species. 



Colour. The teeth are yellow; the upper parts, including the nose, ears 

 and outer surface of the legs and upper surface of the tail, are dark brown. 

 This colour is formed by the hairs being plumbeous at the roots, tipt with 

 light brown and black. On the sides of the neck, the shoulder and near 

 the thighs, the colour is reddish brown. The tail, which is not very dis- 

 tichous, is brown, twice annulated with black ; a few of the hairs are tipt 

 with grey. On the under surface, the lips, cheeks and chin are greyish- 

 brown ; the inner surface of the fore legs, the throat and abdomen cine- 

 reous, lightly tinned in some places with rufous. 



This species differs so widely in all its details, from Sc. Hudsonicus, that 

 it is scarcely necessary to point out their distinctive marks of difference. 

 The space occupied by the lighter colours on the under surface is much 

 narrower than in the former species, nor is there, as in that species, any 

 black line of separation between the colours of the back and under surface.

October, 1841.] 103 



In size, this species is a little larger than the Northern Grey Squirrel, (Sc. 

 leucotis,) and may be compared with the black variety of that species. The 

 ears, which are elliptical in shape and narrower than io most of our species, 

 are thickly clothed with soft, fine hair on both surfaces. The tail is very 

 long, and, instead of being distichous, as in most of the species, is in the 

 prepared specimen perfectly round. The feet are clothed with hair, par- 

 tially concealing the nails. The hair is longer, more diffuse, but not softer 

 than that of Sc. leucotis. 



Colour. The head, ears, upper surface of the legs, tail, and a broad dor- 

 sal line, black. On the sides, the hair is plumbeous at the roots, then a liiae 

 of brown slightly tipt with black. On the under surface, this species is 

 dark brownish black, from the lips to nearly the extent of the jaws. On the 

 throat, inner surface of the legs, and whole under parts of the body, there 

 is a mixture of black and brown fur, giving it a dark, rusty-brown colour. 

 There are no annulations in the hairs of the tail.

When old father Linnaeus comprehended the whole of his description of 

 an American Squirrel in the single word, niger, he was not aware of the 

 number of species of Black squirrels which should yet be detected in our 

 western world, and the perplexity it would give to his successors in decid- 

 ing on the species to which he referred. 



There are now no less than eight North American squirrels, which are 

 either permanently, or in some of their varieties, black. 



The present cannot, however, be identified with any of our known species. 

 It approached nearest to the black variety of the Northern Grey Squirrel, 

 but is sufficiently distinct from that to entitle it to another name. The 

 species in the Atlantic States have, moreover, never been found west of the 

 Rocky Mountains, nor, indeed, have any but the Fox squirrel (Sc. capis- 

 tratus) been observed to the west of the Mississippi river. 



Fuller descriptions, with an account of habits, accompanied by good 

 figures of the above species, will be given in a work on the North American 

 Quadrupeds, now preparing for publication. 



Mr. Haldeman submitted the following " Description of a 

 new species of fresh water Shell." 

 Cyclas (pisidium) dentata. Shell ovate, olivaceous, inflated, 



umbones elevated ; medial and lamellar teeth well developed. 



Length 0.5 ; height 0.4 inch. Hab. Oregon : Mr. Nuttall. 



Bears considerable resemblance to C. similis, from which it 

 may be distinguished by the more elevated beaks. 



N. B. Pisidium abruptum (p. 53,) is not distinct from P. 

 dubium, Say. 




104 [October, 1841. 



Verbal Communications. Mr. Haldeinan called the at- 

 tention of the Academy to several specimens of Unio of vari- 

 ous colours, principally green and brown, the former being 

 referable to U. viridis of Rafinesque, the latter to U. Tappan- 

 ianus, of Lea. 



Mr. H. contends that they are identical, because they pass 

 into each other, both as regards colour and the peculiarities of 

 the cardinal teeth, which are lamellar, and extremely variable 

 in number and size. It was not necessary to add a synonym 

 to the original name, as Mr. Conrad proposed the name sub- 

 viridis (New Fresh- water Shells,) for the brown variety which 

 he figured ; in the event of its proving distinct from U. viri- 

 dis of the west. This method of proposing names is very 

 proper, because it has a tendency to limit the number of 

 synonyms which might might otherwise be inflicted upon the 

 nomenclature of natural history. Some contend that the 

 shell from the Susquehanna cannot be the viridis, because the 

 latter has not been found in the west, its locality being Ken- 

 tucky river, according to Rafinesque ; whilst the Tappanianus 

 is found in the Susquehanna ; but Mr. H. has found unequi- 

 vocal specimens in Pigeon creek, Kentucky, which cannot be 

 distinguished from those found in eastern Pennsylvania. He 

 has found a variety with a thick shell, in James river, Va. 

 Rafinesque's name has been objected to, but one of the speci- 

 mens exhibited presents as brilliant a green as that of Ano- 

 donta cataracta, Say. 



Mr. Haldeman wished the fact to be recorded, that he had 

 placed some living specimens of Western Unio, Unio rectus, 

 triqueter, circulus, cylindricus, ovatus and others, in the Sus- 

 quehanna, where no western species has hitherto been found, 

 except U. viridis, Raf.

Description of several new species of Fossil shells from the 

 cretaceous deposits of the United States. 



First series, from Upper Missouri, 



It is now nearly forty years since Messrs. Lewis and Clark, in 

 their expedition to the Columbia river, procured a few fossils at the 

 great bend of the Missouri river, (Lat. 43 40' N.) which I identi 

 fied as belonging to cretaceous deposits of the same age as the Marl 

 or Ferruginous sand of New Jersey, Delaware, Alabama, &c. Sub- 




October, 1841.] 107 



sequently Mr. Nuttall brought some additional species, but for the 

 most part in fragments. Very lately, however, Mr. J. N. Nicollet 

 having personally visited that remote region, obtained a series of 

 fossils in far greater perfection and variety than any previous tra- 

 veller. It is proposed on the present occasion to indicate the 

 species, and accompany them with a few brief remarks. 



Genus Ammonites. 



1. A. mandanensis. Shell compressed, with scarcely two volutions, 

 the ioner being received into a superficial fossa of the outer whorl- 

 Internal and external margins armed with pointed tubercles, 

 between which are delicate, gently curved costas, mostly bifur- 

 cated about one-third of the distance from the outer tubercles, 

 beyond which they extend across the periphery of the shell ; the 

 latter gently plano-convex. Umbilicus imperforate ? 



The diameter of the largest specimen has been about three 

 inches ; of the smallest I have seen, an inch and a half. In the 

 smaller specimeus the internal marginal tubercles are very indis- 

 tinct ; but in other respects this species appears to be but little 

 modified by age. 



J. A. abyssinus. Whorls convex, making two nearly complete 

 volutions, with strong, gently curved, bifurcated ribs, slightly 

 tuberculated at the margin of the dorsal periphery, which they 

 cross to meet the costse of the opposite side. Umbilicus perfo- 

 rate. Diameter from three-fourths of an inch to one inch. 



This species is strikingly different from the A. mandanensis, in 

 the greater size of its costae, its perforate umbilicus, and its convex 

 dorsal periphery. 



3. A. borealis. Shell convex, rapidly enlarging towards the 

 mouth, with at least two volutions, one received deeply into the 

 other ; costae delicate, gently curved, and bifurcate towards the 

 convex dorsal periphery, which they cross in arched lines 

 between numerous minute tubercles. 



Some years since I saw several specimens of Ammonites which 

 were obtained by Judge Bry, in the township of Wachita, in Lou- 

 16 




108 [October, 1841. 



isiana. I have elsewhere (Synop. p. 24,) considered them as indi- 

 cations of cretaceous deposits ; and my recollection induces me to 

 believe that their characters correspond either to A. Abyssinus or 

 A. borealis. 



Besides the preceding fossils from upper Missouri, Mr. Ni- 

 collet obtained the following species from the same interesting 

 locality. 



Ammonites Conradi (nobis,) Synop. PI. xvi. fig. 1, 2, 3. Large and 

 beautifully preserved specimens. 



Ammonites placenta, (Dekay,) Synop. pi. 2, fig 1. This species 

 is found from comparatively small dimensions to a gigantic size, 

 probably not less than two or three feet in diameter. 



Inoceramus Barabine (nobis,) Synop. PI. xvii. fig. 3, and PI. xiii. 

 fig. 11. This shell has hitherto been found only in Greene county, 

 Alabama, but appears to be abundant in the Mandan country, 

 often compressed and broken, but readily identified. 

 Baculites compressus, (Say,) Synop. PI. ix., fig. 1. This species 

 so nearly resembles B. ovatus of the same naturalist, from the 

 marls of New Jersey, that I am almost disposed to consider them 

 identical. The species in question is found of gigantic dimen- 

 sions, for example, more than a foot in length, and three or four 

 inches in diameter. 

 Belemnites Americanus, (nobis,) Synop. PI. 1, fig. 1, 2, 3. 



Hence it appears that among the small number of species no- 

 ticed on this occasion, at least four are found in deposits of the same 

 age on this side of the Mississippi, thus identifying the cretaceous 

 strata over an immense geographical area, which commences in 

 New Jersey, and perhaps at Martha's Vineyard, is traced in all the 

 Atlantic States to Georgia, thence through Alabama and Mississippi, 

 across the Mississippi to Louisiana, and Arkansas, where it is seen 

 on the plains of the Kiamesha. From this point until we approach 

 the Great Bend of the Missouri river, in the Mandan country, it has 

 not yet been traced; but in the last named region, about 1500 miles 

 above the mouth of the Missouri, it becomes again conspicuous as 




October, 1841.] 109 



already stated, abounding in characteristic organic remains of great 

 beauty. The extent of this locality is not yet known ; it is probable 

 that it occupies a very large area, and is destined to become one of 

 the most interesting and prolific fossil localities that has tempted 

 the enterprise of geologists. These fossils are remarkable alike 

 for their admirable preservation and their great beauty ; the latter 

 being much heightened by the presence of an opalescent nacre 

 which has been rarely noticed in the other cretaceous beds of this 

 country. 



Second series, from the lower cretaceous beds, or ferruginous 

 sand of New Jersey and Delaware. 



Ammonceratites. 



A. Conradi. Shell with an entire whorl, somewhat compressed, 

 with numerous, distinct, slightly curved costse, which diminish 

 and become almost extinct at the internal peripheral margin : 

 external periphery sub-angular, and undulated by the transit of 

 the costge. 



This specimen is a cast in a dark grey ferruginous sand, charged 

 with minute scales of mica. The terminal end is nearly complete, 

 and is almost on a line with what appears to have been the mouth of 

 the shell, and the two approach within a quarter of an inch of each 

 other. Diameter 2 inches. 



This is the first example of an Ammonceratite found in the 

 United States. It was obtained from a marl pit near Arneytown, 

 New Jersey, by Mr. Conrad, in whose name I gladly introduce it 

 to public notice. 



This genus is characteristic of the European chalk, having been 

 found both in England and France, in deposits of that age ; thus 

 affording another evidence of the analogy between the cretaceous 

 deposits of the old world with the marl strata of the new. 



Hamites. 

 H. annulifer. Shell small, cylindrical, equal; the external two- 




110 [October, 1841. 



thirds convex, the internal third coneave, with numerous delicate, 



distinct and closely approximated rings, which encircle the whole 



shell. 



One end of this remarkable species has the characteristic curve 

 and septa of the Hamites. The concave surface looks as if de- 

 signed to receive the cylinder of the opposite side. Length nearly 

 one inch. 



Found by Mr. Conrad in the ferruginous sand at the Deep-cut of 

 the Chesapeake and Delaware canal.

Dr. Edward Hallowell read the following paper on a new species 

 of Reptile ; viz. 



Description of a new species of Chameleon from Western Africa, 

 by Edward Hallowell, M. D. 



Chamveleo gracilis. Description. Head of moderate size, flat- 

 tened above, depressed in front, presenting upon its upper surface 

 a longitudinal carina, bifurcated anteriorly; each of the divisions 

 resulting from this bifurcation, terminates near the posterior ex- 

 tremity of the supraciliary ridge ; in front of the eye is a ridge 

 continuous with the one above the orbit, extending toward the 

 extremity of the nose. No denticulations are observed upon the 

 supraciliary ridge, on the one just described, nor upon the longitu- 

 dinal carina, or its divisions; but they are very distinct along the 

 superior margin of the temples. A number of small tubercles are 

 seen upon the face, quite near to the extremity of the nose, and 

 also upon the sides of the head in front of the nostril ; a marked 

 concavity exists upon the upper and posterior part of the head, 

 immediately behind the bifurcation of the longitudinal carina ; the 

 space in front comprised between the two branches is perfectly 

 plane ; the head is covered above with polygonal scales of unequal 

 size, and smooth for the most part ; those situated in the depres- 

 sions upen the upper and posterior part of the head are somewhat 



^4 






112 [October, 1841. 



larger and more uniform in size than those upon the vertex and face ; 

 scales upon the sides of the head of nearly uniform size, many of 

 them tuberculated ; there are nineteen teeth on each side of the 

 upper and lower jaw; scales upon the sides of the body of various 

 shapes, some of them hexagonal, others pentagonal; the greater 

 number are quadrangular : they vary also in size ; those upon the 

 body, near the spine, are the largest ; some of the scales present a 

 plane surface, others are more or less convex, and many on exami- 

 nation with a glass are observed to have a very distinctly elevated 

 point in the centre ; numerous small granules are interspersed be- 

 tween the scales upon the abdomen; none are observed upon the 

 sides : scales upon the throat irregular in size and shape, many of 

 them tuberculated, those along the median line the largest; scales 

 upon the abdomen granular, of nearly equal size, many of them 

 presenting an elevated point in the centre ; those upon the under 

 surface of the tail oblong, hexagonal, some of them pentagonal 

 many of them with a depression in the centre; those upon the 

 under surface of the hands and toes very distinctly quadrangular, 

 arranged in transverse rows; extremities slender; tail somewhat 

 longer (about a fourth of an inch) than total length of head and 

 body. 



Colour. The predominating colour is green, presenting different 

 shades under different circumstances ; at times, the snout and mar- 

 gin of the jaws, the neck, limbs and tail are marked with ferrugi- 

 nous; and a narrow vitta of a light chocolate colour is seen extend- 

 ing from the axilla to near the groin ; the whole of the body 

 presents at times the latter colour, mixed with dusky green or fer- 

 ruginous ; a triple row of black spots is observed upon the tail, 

 extending from the root to within a short distance of its extremity; 

 a similar row exists upon the back, corresponding with the trans- 

 verse processes of the vertebrae : while one side of the animal pre- 

 sents these shades, the other, or that which is less exposed to the 

 light, is of a uniform pea-green colour, except the lateral vitta and 

 a small spot above the shoulder, which are of a light flesh colour, 

 and at times perfectly white ; on exposing the animal suddenly to 

 the light of a candle, on one occasion, four or five irregular bands 




October, 1841.] 113 



of a light chocolate colour were observed upon the body, extending 

 from the back to the middle line of the belly, the intervening spaces 

 as well as the bands themselves being marked with numerous dark 

 coloured spots ; these bands often became dark green, the inter- 

 vening spaces being a shade or two lighter ; seven or eight con- 

 verging bands of the same dark green colour are observed upon the 

 eyelids, their lower broadest part being directed towards the mar- 

 gin of the orbit; pupil black ; iris golden ; under surface of belly, 

 groins, axillae, as well as inner surface of extremities, whitish with 

 a shade of green. The same banded appearance above described, 

 was frequently observed when the animal was in exercise, as when 

 employed in efforts to get out of its cage, or when allowed to walk 

 upon the table or floor; when quiescent these bands were rarely 

 noticed. On the 9th of July she laid twenty eggs ; these were per- 

 fectly white, without spots, and of an oval figure ; for several days 

 she had been restless, and was employed the greater part of the 

 day in scratching in one of the corners at the bottom of the cage ; 

 the coloration of the animal at this period was different from that 

 noticed at any other ; the whole body presented a deep copperas 

 green color, changing at times to a dusky brown : at times the 

 body has a mottled appearance ; at others four or five dark coloured 

 transverse bands were noticed, the intervening spaces, as well 

 as the bands, presenting numerous light green spots upon a 

 ground of dusky green ; on turning the animal suddenly round to the 

 light, the side opposite to that described, appeared of a rich sap 

 green colour, changing in a few moments to a deep bottle green, 

 the transverse bands becoming less and less distinct; the spot over 

 the shoulder and the lateral vitta were reddish brown : immediately 

 after death the green assumed a yellowish tint, and two large 

 blotches appeared on each side of the body of the colour of lamp 

 black. 



Sept. 11, 1841. The animal has now been immersed in alcohol 

 for more than a year, and presents a very different appearance 

 from that which existed during life ; the head, sides of the body, 

 tail and upper surface of extremities are of a light bluish or leaden 

 colour; the dark coloured blotches upon the sides are visible, but 




114 [October, 1841. 



much less distinct than at the time of the death of the animal ; 

 throat, abdomen, and under surface of extremities and tail, whitish ; 

 the spot upon the shoulder and lateral vitta are dirty white. 



Dimensions. Length of head, one inch (Fr.) : greatest breadth 

 six lines; height seven lines; length of neck two lines; of body 

 two inches eight lines ; of tail four inches seven lines ; of anterior 

 extremities two inches ; of posterior one inch. (These measure- 

 ments were taken after the specimen had been long immersed in 

 spirits.) 



Habits. The animal arrived in this city from New York on the 

 12th of June, 1840. During the first three days its appetite was 

 good, spending the greater part of the time in catching flies by 

 means of its long extensible tongue, which on one or two oocasions 

 it was observed to protrude to the extent of nine inches. The 

 motions of the animal were very sluggish, passing almost the whole 

 of the day upon the perch of the cage in which it was kept, turning 

 the eyes in every direction in search of flies, which were no sooner 

 within reach than the tongue was protruded with the rapidity of 

 lightning, and the insect rapidly drawn into the mouth. In the three 

 or four following days, which were rainy and cold for the season, 

 her appetite appeared to have failed ; during this time she was not 

 seen to catch a fly, although many were quite near, but she often 

 descended from the perch to drink; notwithstanding her indisposi- 

 tion to eat, she would watch for hours the motions of the flies about 

 the cage, the eyes preserving their accustomed brilliancy of ex- 

 pression. On being placed upon a plane surface, she walked with 

 more care, and often with more rapidity than might have been ex- 

 pected from the pincer-like arrangement of the feet and bands, 

 the fingers and toes being fully extended; but the usual manner of 

 progression and general appearance of the animal when in motion, 

 corresponded with the description of those given by Valisnieri. 

 During the time that she was laying her eggs, she did not eat, nor 

 had she taken food for several days previous ; she became greatly 

 emaciated, and died almost immediately after their expulsion from 

 the body.

General observations. The specimen above described was pur- 

 chased by the Rev. Charles Eden, of Monrovia, of one of the 

 African natives, and sent to Dr. Blanding of this city, who, with his 

 accustomed liberality, pi. iced it in my hands for observation and 

 description. A drawing of the animal was recently shown to M. 

 Bibran, of the Gardeo of Plants, by the artist who made it, who 

 informs me that he considers it as new. 



*Dr. Goddard stated that he had examined the so-called 

 " Missourium Kochii," and found it to be a skeleton composed 

 of Mastodon bones, most of which appeared to belong to a 

 single set, many, however, having been superadded, and 

 others mended and glued together in a manner wholly errone- 

 ous. 



The following errors were especially noticed: 



Spine. The spine presented the anomaly of 8 cervical ver- 

 tebrae ; and instead of 19 dorsal and 4 lumbar, had 23 dorsal 

 and 10 lumbar vertebras, making the number of bones in the 

 spine too great by 11. The bones articulated with the 2nd 

 and 4th ribs were cervical vertebrae. The spaces between 

 the vertebrae were much magnified by thick wooden blocks 

 placed between them, and the spine was curved upwards, so 

 as to give an exaggerated idea of the height of the animal. 



Ribs. These were redundant in number, and were spread 

 out as much as possible, so as to present the appearance of a 

 wide and flat chest. The 1st pair of ribs were stuck on the 

 bones of the shoulder, to resemble clavicles bones which the 

 Mastodon does not possess. 



Head. The head was that of a Mastodon with the top de- 

 ficient, and a piece of an ethmoidal ? bone glued on in front to

resemble a snout. The tusks were distorted laterally, so as to 

 occupy a space of 18 feet in width. 



Scapulae and ilia. These having been deficient, were very 

 ingeniously pieced out of wood, glued over so as to resemble 

 bone. 



Feet. The feet were ludicrously made up of carpal and 

 tarsal bones, and presented the wonderful anomaly of 4 pha- 

 langes to each toe. 



Several other discrepancies were observed ; apart from 

 which Dr. G. considered the skeleton one of very great 

 interest.

Professor Johnson made some remarks on the samples of 

 Anthracite from Rhode Island, this evening presented, and 



stated 



That the formation in which they occur, reposes on a coarse con- 

 glomerate, which rests immediately on granite or hornblende rocks 

 of the primitive series. The near proximity of primitive rocks 

 appears to have exercised an important influence, not only on the 

 position, but on the present character of the anthracite of this for- 

 mation ; for while it has thrown the beds into a highly inclined posi- 

 tion, it has expelled the last vestiges of volatile matter, decomposed 

 the sulphuret of iron, and changed the colour of the coal in some of 

 the beds to a nearly steel blue. The vegetable impressions are in 

 these cases to a great extent obliterated, and the traces of them 

 only appear at the surfaces of deposition. In other beds, the im- 

 pressions are more perfect, and their genera and species are more 

 readily made out. 



An idea has been formerly current, that the coal formation of 

 Rhode Island and Massachusetts is of more ancient date than those 

 of Pennsylvania ; but the identity of fossil remains occurring in 

 both, seems to determine the geological period of both to be the 

 same. And in this respect we have analogies sufficiently numerous 

 in our own country, to induce us to believe that all the coal forma- 

 tions are essentially contemporaneous, and that whether they rest on 




November, 1841.] 119 



granite, as in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Virginia, on the 

 older members of the secondary, as in the anthracite fields of Penn- 

 sylvania, or on the mountain or the " cliff"" limestone of the western 

 states, the coal series has every where been the product of a period 

 in the history of our planet which was highly prolific in vegetable 

 life, of which the remains were deposited on whatever member of 

 preceding formations was exposed in a condition to receive them. 



The anthracite of Rhode Island appears to have been subjected 

 not only to a high temperature, but also to intense pressure, and to 

 have been much comminuted by the friction of one member of the 

 formation sliding over another in the uptilting which the strata have 

 evidently undergone. The coal in all such cases being more tender 

 and friable than the sandstones, slates and limestones, becomes the 

 unguent in the joints of the stratification, and the results of its power 

 to facilitate the motions of the strata as they are partially folded up, 

 is, 1st, a pulverulent portion in contact with either the top or the 

 bottom rock of the bed ; 2d, a high polish imparted to some of the 

 sliding surfaces of the more durable coal ; 3d, an irregularity in the 

 thickness of the coal beds, the indentations of the upper and lower 

 rocks being not unfrequently found opposite to each other, forming 

 thick places in the coal seam, and containing much of the broken 

 material which has been displaced from the parts where the promi- 

 nences of the rocks come nearly in contract, and almost shut up the 

 seam. 



Prof. Johnson adverted to the fact that for reasons stated by the 

 geologists of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, viz. the great amount of 

 drift or diluvial matter with which all parts of this coal formation 

 have been covered over, the limits of the coal trough have not hitherto 

 been traced with much precision. 



Within the city of Providence, the strike of the beds is a little to 

 the east of south, and the dip of course to the north of east. The 

 mining operations are in general very troublesome and expensive, 

 on account of bein<r carried on below water level, and through a 

 thick stratum of loose earth and gravel. Very little of the coal 

 hitherto obtained has been of merchantable quality.

Written Communications. A letter was read from Dr. J. 

 P. Giraud, presenting the copy of his work noticed in the 

 donations of this evening. 



Verbal Communications. Mr. Quinby communicated some 

 facts in relation to the Spontaneous Combustion of bituminous 

 coal. 



He had recently conversed with a gentleman who arrived on 

 Friday last, in Philadelphia, from South America. The steam 

 vessels sent from England to the Pacific, to run between Valparaiso 

 and Panama, were made the subject of remark. His informant 

 stated that one of the cargoes of coal sent from Great Britain to 

 Chili, for the use of the steamers, took fire spontaneously on the 

 voyage round Cape Horn ; and that it was with difficulty extin- 

 guished. The gentleman also alluded to the fact so well known on 

 that coast, that cargoes of bituminous coal, obtained at Conception, 

 a few degrees south of Valparaiso, had ignited spontaneously on 

 the voyage to Coquimbo, in the north of Chili, where an extensive 

 copper-smelting establishment had been projected by an English 

 company, and which was abandoned mainly in consequence of the 

 character of the Conception coal. 



Dr. Morton stated, that he had in his possession a living 

 albino Raccoon, Procyon lotor, which he had received from 

 the Rev. Joseph B. Gross, of Saillersville, near Easton, Penn- 

 sylvania. The animal is remarkably large and healthy, with 

 very long yellowish white fur and pink-coloured eyes. Both 

 in appearance and habits, this individual has much resem- 

 blance to a bear, and forcibly reminds the observer of the fact 

 that Linnceus placed the Raccoon in his genus Ursus. 



Prof. Johnson exhibited an apparatus to illustrate the pheno- 

 mena of the rotation of fluids. 



A cylindrical vessel or jar, about 4 inches in diameter and 12 

 inches high, was placed on a stand supported on an axis of revolu- 

 tion, standing vertical on a pivot, and put in motion by a band from 

 a larger wheel moved by a crank. When any liquid is placed in 




122 [November, 1841. 



this jar and a rapid motion is given to the latter, the liquid hy 

 degrees acquires the rotary velocity, and by the effect of centrifu- 

 gal force is compelled to rise round the inside of the jar. If the 

 velocity be sufficient, the liquid may be made to rise to the very 

 top of the jar and be thrown out. 



If two liquids of different specific gravities and incapable of 

 chemical action on each other, be placed within the jar, the rota- 

 tion of the glass may give to the different liquids corresponding 

 velocities of rotation, but these will be acquired in times varying 

 with the adhesiveness of the liquid to the glass. 



This diversity in the times of acquiring the same velocity as the 

 containing vessel, gives rise to some apparent anomalies, while the 

 speed is either increasing or diminishing. If oil and spirit of tur- 

 pentine be placed in the cylinder, the former at the bottom, the 

 surface of separation is more concave upward than the upper surface 

 of the turpentine, because the oil is more adhesive than the spirits 

 of turpentine : but placing alcohol below the spirits of turpentine, 

 the latter becomes the more adhesive liquid and acquires the velo- 

 city of revolution of the jar sooner than the other, whence it will, 

 by its superior centrifugal force, be urged downward as well a 

 upward, from its original level while at rest. The more adhesive 

 liquid in this case constitutes a double concave lens. The same is 

 produced when water, oil and alcohol are made to revolve in the 

 same jar, the oil occupying the middle stratum in a state of rest, 

 forms, at first and while the velocity is increasing, a concave sur- 

 face both above and below, but when the speed of the revolution of 

 the jar is slackened, it is by its superior adhesiveness sooner brought 

 to rest than the other two liquids ; these will therefore, by con- 

 tinuing their centrifugal force after that of the oil has ceased, cause 

 the latter to assume a double convex form. 



Prof. Johnson referred to some statements relative to experiments 

 of this nature sometime since made in Paris, in which it was de- 

 clared, that the " chemical affinities''' of the liquids were the cause 

 of these apparent anomalies ; and that attempts had been made to 

 deduce from experiments of this nature " a mechanical measure of 

 chemical affinity." With that species of attraction he proved that 

 the results could have no connexion.

 Academy with the complete skeleton and skin of the Orang of 

 Borneo, Simia satyrus? received November 2d. 



Dr. George C. Leib communicated a description of the nest 

 and eggs of the Fulica Americana and Anas discors. 



He saw the Fulica Americana, in the month of June, 1841, 

 breeding in the greatest abundance in the marshes bordering on 

 Lake Erie, Erie county, Michigan. They were associated with the 

 Florida galinules (Galinula galiata,) which were likewise em- 

 ployed in the labour of reproduction, and so close was the intimacy 

 between them, that their nests were interspersed over the marsh 

 in the most neighbourly contiguity, seldom being more than a few 

 feet apart. The nest, rounded in form and rude in structure, is 

 composed entirely of dried or withered rushes, without lining of any 

 sort, slightly interlaced, except at bottom, where there is a simple 

 crossing of the pieces to the depth of several inches. 



It is five inches in depth, by a foot and a half to two feet in 

 diameter. This large mass is placed on the surface of the water 

 among the dense rushes, to which it is attached in several points of 

 its circumference, thus rendering it less liable to be swept ofFby the 

 winds and waves. 



When disturbed these birds emit a note not unlike the cackle of 

 the domestic hen, which is transmitted from one to the other for a 

 considerable distance around, till the air becomes vocal with their 

 music. This was heard by Dr. Leib not only during the day, but 

 also at all hours of the night. 



The number of the eggs varies from ten to fifteen, though the 

 latter were observed to prevail. They are of an oval form, and 

 measure two inches by one inch and a quarter, uniformly sprinkled 

 with small dark brown spots on a greenish yellow ground. Both 

 male and female assist in incubation. 



Owing to their exceeding abundance, they are gathered by the 

 neighbouring farmers for the table, and are considered by them 

 superior in flavour and delicacy to the common hen's egg. 




November, 1841.] 125 



Dr. Leib found the nest of the blue-winged Teal (Anas discors,) 

 together with that of the Mallard (Anas boschas,) in the month of 

 June, in the meadows adjoining the marsh above referred to. 



It is composed externally of dried grasses, neatly arranged in a 

 circular form, and lined with a thick bed of down, taken from the 

 breast of the female. It contained 18 eggs of a delicate cream 

 colour, which measure 2 inches by 1| inch. Though remarkably 

 timid and wary at other times, such is its abstraction or devotion 

 when upon the nest, that it would suffer me to approach near enough 

 to strike it with a stick ; then in the greatest alarm, suddenly flutter 

 and bustle off through the grass for some distance, like a wounded 

 bird ; until, satisfied that the ruse had diverted attention from its 

 treasure, it would mount into the air and quickly leave the object 

 of its terror and solicitude behind. 



Dr. Morton made some remarks on the so called Pigmy race 

 of people who are asserted to have formerly inhabited a part 

 of the Valley of the Mississippi. 



It has long been contended by intelligent persons, who, however, 

 were ignorant of anatomy, that the adjusted bones of individuals of 

 this race, never exceed four feet and a half in height, and are 

 often but three feet. These statements induced Dr. Morton to inves- 

 tigate the subject by means of a skeleton of one of these people, 

 which he at length obtained through the kindness of Dr. Troost of 

 Nashville ; Mr. A. M'Call, a correspondent of Dr. Troost, having 

 exhumed these remains from a cemetery near the Cumberland 

 Mountain, in White county, Tennessee. 



" The coffins," observes Mr. M'Call, in the letter read by Dr. 

 Morton, "are from 18 to 24 inches in length, by 18 inches deep 

 and 15 wide. They are made of six pieces of undressed sandstone 

 or limestone, in which the bodies are placed with their shoulders 

 and head elevated against the eastern end, and the knees raised 

 towards the face, so as to put the corpse in a reclined or sitting pos- 

 ture. The right arm rested on an eathern pot, of about two pints 

 in capacity, without legs, but with lateral projections for being lifted. 

 With these pots, in some graves, are found basins and trays also of 



19 




126 [November, 1841. 



pipe clay and comminuted shells mixed ; and no one of these reposi- 

 tories is without cooking utensils. In one of the graves was found 

 a complete skull, and an os femoris, but most of the other bones 

 were broken in hastily removing them. This is said to be the lar- 

 gest skeleton ever found at any of these burying grounds. It has 

 the cranium very flat and broad, with very projecting front teeth, 

 and appears to have pertained to an individual not over twelve or 

 fourteen years of age." 



After reading Mr. M'Call's letter, Dr. Morton exhibited the 

 bones which accompanied it, and remarked that the stage of devel- 

 opment of the teeth indicated a very juvenile subject. For example, 

 many of the deciduous or first teeth yet remained in both jaws ; 

 while the only teeth of the permanent set which had protruded, were 

 the first molars and the incisors, which, as every anatomist knows, 

 make their appearance at about seven years of age. Of the other 

 permanent teeth, some had no part formed but the crown, and all 

 were completely embraced within the maxillary bones. The pre- 

 sence of the new incisors, isolated from the cuspidati which had not 

 appeared, obviously gave rise to Mr. M'Call's remark respecting 

 the very " projecting front teeth," but which, however, are perfectly 

 natural in position and proportion. The cranial bones are thin, and 

 readily separable at the sutures ; nor does the flat and broad confi- 

 guration of the cranium differ from what is common to the aborigi- 

 nal American race. The long bones have their extremities sepa- 

 rated by ephiphyses ; and every fact observed in these remains is 

 strictly characteristic of early childhood ; or about the seventh 

 year of life. Even the recumbent or sitting posture in which 

 they are found, has been observed in the dead bodies of the 

 American nations from Cape Horn to Canada ; and the utensils 

 found with them, are the same in form and composition with 

 those exhumed from the graves of the common Indians. 



Dr. Morton concluded by remarking that these remains were to 

 him an additional and convincing proof of what he had never doubt- 

 ed viz. that the so called Pigmies of the western country, were 

 merely children, who, for reasons not readily explained, but which 

 actuate some religious communities of our own time, were buried 

 apart from the adult people of their tribe.

 Hypodon meaning teeth below ; the other, teeth above. Ex- 

 amples, H. Desmarestii H. Sowerbyi. 



Verbal Communications. Prof. Johnson exhibited and ex- 

 plained his apparatus, illustrative of the laws of chemical 

 combination and of the combining volumes of gaseous sub- 

 stances. 



This apparatus consists of a series of cubical types, each of such 

 magnitude as to represent by its bulk in cubic inches the atomic 

 weight of one of the elementary bodies. Thus hydrogen is represent- 

 ed by a cube one inch on a side ; oxygen, by a cube of two inches 

 on a side, containing of course eight cubic inches ; iron by a cube 

 containing twenty-eight cubic inches, and so of the whole fifty-four 




128 [November, 1841. 



simple bodies. The largest cube representing Uranium is a little 

 more than six inches on a side. Each cube bears on one of its 

 faces the conventional chemical symbol of the body whose atomic 

 weight it represents, usually the first letter of its name, together 

 with the number expressing its atomic weight. Many of the 

 types are coloured either by a coating of the material represented, 

 or by some convenient pigment exhibiting the natural appearance 

 of the body represented. The number of types of each body 

 varies with the complexity of the compounds into which it is capa- 

 ble of entering ; the greatest number being required of those bodies, 

 which constitute organic substances, viz. carbon, hydrogen, oxygen 

 and nitrogen. 



A second part of the apparatus consists of a light frame support- 

 ing three shelves about fourteen inches apart, open both at the 

 front and rear. This frame is four feet long and two and a half feet 

 high. In order to represent chemical combinations and decomposi- 

 tions, the atom-cubes are first placed separately upon the middle 

 shelf, to represent the case of solution or the liquid state. They 

 are then brought together to indicate mixture of solutions. To 

 represent precipitation, those atoms which are in fact precipitated 

 in actual solutions are carried to the lower shelf; and to represent 

 the products converted into gas, those atoms which constitute such 

 products are carried from the middle to the upper shelf. 



The chemist performs the processes first in his jars or retorts, 

 and then arranges the atoms to indicate the real operations which 

 have been taking place before the eyes of his class. 



In exhibiting the combinations of bodies which may assume a 

 gaseous form, Prof. Johnson makes use of a third apparatus, con- 

 sisting of glass cubical boxes of 100 cubic inches each, and of others 

 containing 50 and 16# cubic inches. 



To represent the combinations and decompositions of gases as in 

 experiments in Eudiometry, both the cubical types and glass boxes 

 are brought into requisition. Thus the type of hydrogen (a cube 

 one inch on a side, marked H 1 ,) is placed on the upper shelf, and 

 over it is inverted a cubical glass box, marked 100, and actually 

 containing that number of cubic inches ; an oxygen type (marked 




November, 1841.] \2<j 



O 8) is placed separately on the same shelf under a glass box of 

 the same size as to base, but of only half tiie height of the former, 

 and containing of course 50 cubic inches. To represent the com- 

 bination of these gases to form water and to indicate the amount of 

 condensation which takes place, the oxygen type is taken from 

 under its own box and placed with the hydrogen type beneath the 

 glass box of 100 cubic inches, the 50 inch box being at the same 

 time removed from the frame. There is then seen the sum of the 

 weights of the constituents of water (9), and the bulk of the vapour 

 of water, the same as that of the hydrogen which had entered into 

 its composition. To convey the impression that the product is a 

 liquid, the resulting combination of atoms is carried from the upper 

 to the middle shelf, without being accompanied by the volume-cube. 



The advantages found to result from this method of illustration 

 over those hitherto in use were stated to be the saving of much 

 time and labour, in writing out diagrams and making drawings, 

 and the avoiding of inconvenience of working at a black-board to 

 give after all but an imperfect impression of the truth to be con- 

 veyed. An effect of not less importance was derived from appeal- 

 ing to different faculties at the same time. 



To some minds the bulk of a body conveys a far more distinct 

 impression of its weight than the figures which represent that 

 weight. In the method now exhibited, both these modes of appeal- 

 ing to the mind and memory are united. The colour of many of 

 the substances combined with the bulk with the symbols which 

 represent them and with the figures which expi-ess their weight, can 

 hardly fail to fix a lasting impression on the mind of every student 

 in chemistry. To these maybe added the facility of making appa- 

 rent by direct juxtaposition the relation by weight and by volume 

 of the constituents of all gaseous mixtures. 



The application of this apparatus was shown in exhibiting the 

 composition of the oxides and other minerals. 



The views of M. Liebig in regard to the composition and true 

 radical of Phosgene gas, carbonic acid and oxalic acid, were also 

 displayed. 



The constitution of ammonia, of atmospheric air, of nitrous- 



20 




130 [November, 1841. 



oxide, and binoxide of nitrogen, was illustrated both in regard to 

 atomic weight and combining volume, as were the several com- 

 pounds of chlorine with oxygen. The acetate of lead was decom- 

 posed by a solution of hydrosulphate of ammonia, and the resulting 

 acetate of ammonia, sulphuret of lead and an atom of water were 

 indicated as the results. 



Chloride of iron precipitated by carbonate of ammonia, exhibited 

 the effects of giving a precepitate of oxide of iron and evolving 

 carbonic acid, decomposing water instead of forming it as in the 

 preceding example.

 strata of New Jersey. 



Pinna. 



P. rostriformis. Shell thin, elongated, narrow, smooth, but 

 gently undulated from the beak to the opposite extremity. 



This fossil is not uncommon in fragments in the cretaceous 

 limestone of Timber Creek, in Gloucester county, New Jersey; 

 but this instance is the first which has occurred sufficiently 

 perfect for description. I have referred to it in my " Synopsis 

 of Organic Remains," page 63, but did not then venture to 

 give it a specific designation. The specimen now in question 

 was found and kindly lent me by Mr. Conrad. 



Cidarites. 



C.splcndcus. Scutellrc pentagonal, granulated at the margin, 

 between which and the papilla the surface is smooth and 




December, 1841.] 133 



sub-conical. Scutellae in pairs ? separated by longitudinal, 

 granulated, slightly curved bands. Spines elongated, lon- 

 gitudinally granulated, and attached to the papilla; by 

 numerous very small, flattened appendages. 

 Found with the preceding fossil in the cretaceous limestone 

 of New Jersey. 



A communication was read from Oliver P. Hubbard, Esq., 

 acknowledging the receipt of a letter announcing his election 

 as a correspondent of the Academy. 



Mr. John S. Phillips stated that the Helix described by him 

 at page 27 of these Proceedings, with the specific name of 

 bidentifera^ is the H. barbula of Rossmasler, a Portuguese 

 shell. Mr. P. was led into an error in respect to its locality 

 by the gentleman from whom he received it, and consequently 

 described it as new.

December, 1841.] 135 



Dr. Morton communicated the results of the measurements 

 of forty-five adult negro crania, in order to ascertain the in- 

 ternal capacity of the skull and consequent size of the brain 

 in the African race. These skulls were those of negroes born 

 in Africa, of theBassa, Grabbo, Makoua,Benguela, Mina and 

 other tribes. They consist of 25 males and 20 females, vary- 

 ing from 18 to 50 years of age. The largest heads in the 

 series, three in number, give ninety-nine cubit inches of inter- 

 nal capacity ; the smallest head, that of a Makoua, 6S cubic 

 inches. The mean of the whole series gave eighty-five cubic 

 inches. 



Dr. Morton added, that he was not yet prepared to give a 

 decided opinion in relation to the comparative size of the 

 European and Negro brains, but so far as his observations had 

 gone, he believed the former would be found to exceed the 

 latter by at least seven cubic inches. 



The measurements adverted to give the absolute size of the 

 brain, and were conducted on the plan described at page 7 of 

 these Proceedings. 



STATED MEETING, December 21, 1841. 



Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



Written Communications. A letter was read from the 

 Rev. William Coggswell, corresponding Secretary of the 

 Northern Academy of Arts and Sciences, at Hanover, New 

 Hampshire, soliciting for that Institution a portion of the pub- 

 lished transactions of this Society. Whereupon the committee 




361 [December, 1841. 



of publication were instructed to furnish Dr. Coggswell with 

 volumes VI. and VII., and Part I. of Vol. VIII., together with 

 the Proceedings of the Academy as far as published. 



A letter was also read from Dr. Edwin Fussell, dated Pen- 

 dleton, Indiana, December 5th, announcing thai he had trans- 

 mitted a box of Fossil Organic remains for the cabinet of the 

 Academy, and tendering his services in collecting in several 

 other departments of Natural History. 



The chairman then called the attention of the members to 

 the importance of publishing, without delay, and in accordance 

 with a former resolution, the second part of vol. VIII. of the 

 Journal of the Academy. He stated that several highly im- 

 portant memoirs awaited the Society's acceptance, which 

 together with those already in the hands of the committee, 

 were amply sufficient to form a half volume.

 demy's Proceedings. 




140 [January, 1S42 



Verbal Communications. Dr. G. C. Leib remarked, that 

 in looking over Dr. Giraud's work entitled " Sixteen New 

 Species of Birds," he found the Parus leucotis of Giraud, to 

 be identical with the Setofaga rubra of Swaiuson. 



Professor Johnson made some observations on the sponta- 

 neous combustion of Bituminous Coal. 



He stated that he had recently been invited to inspect aheap of 

 biluminous coal on the premises of Mr. John W. Middleton of this 

 city, which had for a few days previous been observed to be grow- 

 ing warm and giving off vapour very copiously, from which it 

 was inferred to be approaching spontaneous combustion. The 

 coal in question was stated to be from the Allegheny mountain, 

 above Holidaysburg, and to be a mixture of two or three different 

 mines. On causing a hole to be excavated about three feet deep, 

 the temperature was found to be 110 Fahrenheit ; and the day 

 being cold, (below freezing point) the volume of steam which 

 arose on moving the coal was so great as almost completely to 

 envelope and hide the workmen. All parts of the heap were ob- 

 served to exhibit distinct traces of the effloresced sulphate of iron; 

 or if some pieces of the coal had no visible marks of this kind, 

 they still exhibited to the sense of taste the strongest evidence of 

 being covered with that salt. 



This coal evidently possessed all the requisites for producing 

 spontaneous combustion, and only required time, and perhaps a 

 rather larger heap, to bring that process to the same termination 

 as was observed a few weeks since in the city of Lowell. 



The chairman having announced the demise of our vener- 

 able associate John Vaughan. Esq., on motion of Professor 

 Johnson, it was unanimously 



Resolved, That this Society have heard with deep regret, the 

 announcement of the decease of their late valuable member, John 

 Vaughan, Esq., so long known in our community for his various 

 merits, both in relation to scientific objects and to benevolent pur- 

 poses and institutions ; and they would by this act testify their

high estimation of those excellent traits of character by which 

 their deceased fellow member was so eminently distinguished. 

 Resolved, That the Corresponding Secretary communicate to 

 the family of the deceased, a copy of the foregoing resolution.

the Susquehanna river. From Mr. S. S. Haldeman. 

 Two species of Fuligula minor (Giraud,) or Scaup Duck. 



Presented by Mr. J. G. Bell, of New York. 



Written Communications. A communication was read 

 from Mr. Haldeman, describing two new species of the genus 

 Perca, from the Susquehanna river, viz. P. nebulosa, and P. 

 minima ; which was referred to a committee. 



A letter was read from Mr. J. G. Bell, of New York, dated 

 January Sth, in which he offers some remarks on the two 

 specimens of Fuligula minor, or lesser Scaup Duck, presented 

 by him this evening. He states, that they have hitherto been 

 mistaken for the common Scaup Duck, (Anas marila of Wil- 

 son); and although Mr. Audubon figures this bird, and Wilson 

 the larger one, these naturalists had supposed them to be spe- 




142 [January, 1842. 



cifically the same. He adds, that Mr. Audubon has now com- 

 pared these two ducks, and is satisfied that they are distinct 

 species. 



Mr. T. A. Conrad read a paper intended for publication in 

 the Journal, entitled, " Observations on the Silurian and 

 Devonian systems of the United States, with descriptions of 

 New Organic Remains." This memoir embraces descrip- 

 tions of 103 new species, included in 21 genera, viz. 



Avicula 23 species. Cypricardita, 6. Inoceramus, 3. 

 Microdon, 1. Moculites, 2. Plurorynchus, 3. Strophomena, 

 21. Delthyris, 13. Or'this, 1. Atrypa, 6. Helicoceras, 1. 

 Orthoceras, 1. Goniotites, 1. Belerophon, 3. Pleuratoma- 

 ria, 7. Euornphalus, 1. Loxonema, 1. Cyrtoceras, 1. Asa- 

 phus, 2. Calymene, 1. 



The paper was referred to a committee with a view to 

 immediate publication in the 2d part of the 8th volume of 

 the Academy's Journal, now in press. 



Professor Rogers announced that his brother Professor William 

 B. Rogers, of Virginia, has recently satisfied himself of the geologi- 

 cal age of the coal formation of the vicinity of Richmond ; and also 

 of the date of the Fredericksburgh sandstone. The former he re- 

 gards as nearly equivalent in period to the lias of Europe, and the 

 laiter to be referable to that of the oolite. The existence in the 

 Richmond coal measures of the genus Tseniopterus, a race of 

 plants strictly characteristic of the lias, is one of the points upon 

 which he rests his conclusions respecting that formation. A dis- 

 covery in the Fredericksburg sandstone of fossil cycadeae and 

 other organic remains, lead hirn to place this rock in the period 

 of the oolites. He considers those the only formations yet recog- 

 nised in the United States, which are referable to the ages of the 

 European Lias and Oolite rocks.

Written Communications. Mr. Haldeman read a paper 

 on three new species of Unionidoe, from the waters of the 

 United States, viz. Unio abacus, U. puniceus, and Anodon 

 plicatus. Referred to a committee. 



Mr. Conrad read some additions to his paper on the Silu- 

 rian and Devonian Fossils read at the last meeting ; which 

 was refeired to a committee. 



Mr. Conrad also read a memoir, "on the Identity of the 

 Middle Cretaceous Formation of the United States, with the 

 Faxoe limestone of Europe." 



Mr. Conrad stated as the result, of mature observation and re- 

 flection, that the medial division of the American cretaceous strata, 

 as seen on Timber creek, in New Jersey, are of the same age 




144 [January, 1842. 



with the white chalk of Europe, as maintained by Dr. Morton. 

 He announced the discovery at that locality, of a Planularia, a 

 multilocular shell characteristic of the European chalk. Mr. Con- 

 rad has also detected in the medial cretaceous beds at Wilming- 

 ton, North Carolina, the Cirrus perspectivus, a Nautilus which he 

 believes to be the N. Danicus, and the Cyprsca bullaria ; the last 

 two being characteristic of the Faxoe limestone. 



Mr. Conrad's paper being designed for publication, was 

 referred to a committee. 



Verbal Communications. Professor Johnson stated the 

 results of some experiments on the magnetism of bars of 

 wrought iron broke by tensile force. 



He referred to a former communication, in which he had given 

 an account of trials on cast iron in a state of fusion, and to the 

 influence of terrestrial magnetism, inducing the magnetic state in 

 bars of iron, according to the position in which they are placed 

 with reference to the magnetic axis. He had found that when a 

 bar of soft iron is drawn asunder at ordinary temperatures, and 

 in the direction of the magnetic meridian, there was also manifes- 

 ted at the point of fracture a decided evidence of magnetic polar- 

 ity; and that the kind of magnetism was that belonging to the 

 region towards which the broken extremity of each fragment 

 pointed. This magnetic condition was indicated by the adhesion 

 of any particle of iron or of hammer cinder, which chanced to be 

 near the fracture at the moment, as well as by the action of a 

 small needle when held near the point. 



If the two extremities separated from each other by a short 

 distance, be at the moment of fracture in contact with a mass of 

 iron filings, the latter will adhere to the two ends, and extending 

 across, form a continuous line or bridge, which appears to serve 

 as a keeper, for they continue for a considerable time with little 

 diminution of their force. 



When the fracture is made at a red heat, little or no magnetic 

 effect appears to result from the action of breaking. But when 




January, 1842.] 145 



the temperature of the bar is between five and six hundred degrees 

 of Fahrenheit, the magnetism is not only marked at the time, but 

 is in a great degree permanent. Samples were stated to have been 

 examined, which had been broken for several years, and to be 

 still in the same magnetic state in which they were at the moment 

 of fracture. 



In order to prove what part of the effect in the foregoing in- 

 stances, was due to the earth's magnetic influence, the proving 

 machine which produced ihe fracture, was changed in position, so 

 as to place the bar, in proving, directly across the magnetic meri- 

 dian, instead of coinciding with it as before. In this case no po- 

 larity was observed, whether the bars were broken cold or hot, 

 except some slight indications in a direction across the breadth of 

 the bar at the point of fracture.

 and executor, Alexander Maclure, and that the same had 

 been appropriated to the payment of various claims on the 

 Institution, the details of which were given. 



Whereupon the following resolutions, offered by Prof. John- 

 son, were unanimously adopted : 



Resolved, That the Academy has received with lively 

 satisfaction the announcement this evening made by the 

 Treasurer, of the receipt of $6000, on account of the second 

 subscription of $10,000 by our late President, William Ma- 

 clure, Esq., deceased, towards the erection of the new Hall; 

 and of its application to the final extinguishment of claims 

 on account of the building, and to an important reduction in 

 the obligations for the purchase of the ground now the pro- 

 perty of the Institution. 



Resolved, That the thanks of the Academy are due to 

 Alexander and Anna Maclure, executors of the will of their 

 late brother William Maclure, for their praiseworthy efforts in 

 carrying out the designs of the deceased, in advancing the 

 interests and prosperity of this Institution, and thereby pro- 

 moting the cause of Science, to which so much of his liberal- 

 ity, and so large a portion of his life, were devoted. 



On motion of Mr. Clay, Resolved, that a copy of the fore- 

 going resolutions be transmitted to Alexander Maclure, Esq.

clature in Natural History; both of which were referred to the 

 committee on Mr. Haldeman's previous paper read Feb. 1, 

 1S42. 



BUSINESS BY SPECIAL RESOLUTION. 



The chairman called the attention of the Society to several 

 papers on scientific subjects, offered at previous meetings, 

 which had not been referred to appropriate committees, and 

 suggested some action thereon. 



On motion of Dr. Elwyn, the subject was then brought 

 before the meeting, and the communications alluded to were 

 referred, as follows: 



A paper by Walter R. Johnson, "On the relation between 

 the coal of South Wales and some Pennsylvania anthracites,'' 

 read June 15,1841; and another by the same author, entitled, 

 " Description of an apparatus illustrative of the laws of chemi- 

 cal combination, and of the combining volumes of gaseous 

 substances," read Nov. 23d, 1S41: referred to Messrs. Dra- 

 per, Lukens and Phillips. 



A description of the nest and eggs of Fulica Americana, 

 and Anasdiscors, by Geo. C. Leib, M. D , read Nov. 16th, 

 1841. Referred to Messrs. Vaux, Burrough and Morton. 



Two communications by S. G. Morton, M. D., one con- 

 taining remarks on the so-called Pigmy race of the valley of 

 the Mississippi, read Nov. 16th, 1S41, and the other on the 

 ancient Peruvian race: referred to Messrs. McMurtrie, 

 Phillips and Bridges. 



The following reports, omitted at the last meeting for busi- 

 ness, were then read and accepted. 



The report of the committee on Mr. Haldeman's paper on 

 several new species of Umo ; and the report of the committee 

 on Dr. Morton's paper, on some new species of organic re- 

 mains of the cretaceous group of the United States, &c, both 

 in favour of publication.

 ing. 



Written Communications. The chairman read a memoir 

 from Dr. A. Clapp of New Albany, Indiana, on the Lime- 

 stone formation of that district. Referred to a committee con- 

 sisting of Mr. Conrad, Prof. Rogers and Mr. Vanuxem. 



Verbal Communications. Prof. Johnson presented for 

 inspection, a portion of the kelson of the frigate Raritan, in a 

 state of dry rot. This vessel was still on the stocks at the 

 Philadelphia Navy Yarchher building having been commenced 

 at least 20 years since. She had been salted. Her lower 

 timbers, previous to the commencement of repairs, were 

 generally in the same condition as the portion exhibited. 



Also a sample of oak joist from the old Legislative Hall, 

 built at Chester, Pennsylvania, in 1682. Decay had not yet 

 commenced in this wood, owing probably to its complete pro- 

 tection from the action of moisture ; whereas in the other case, 

 the wood was constantly subjected to the alternate action of 

 dryness and moisture. 



Professor Johnson also alluded to the hardening influence 

 of water on oak wood when long submerged. 



Dr. Chaloner stated that he had in his possession specimens 

 of oak timber turned into various forms, which had been 

 derived from a vessel, (the Lyons frigate,) submerged in the 

 river Delaware since the period of theRevolution, and which 

 had acquired almost the hardness of iron. 



Professor Johnson then exhibited samples of residua from 



24 




156 



[March, 1842. 



a number of Anthracite and Bituminous coal of Europe and 

 this country, on which he had experimented wiih a view of 

 ascertaining the relative proportions in each, of volatile mat- 

 ter, earthy matter, and carbon. The experiments were per- 

 formed on all in a similar manner, viz. by exposing the coal 

 to a red heat, raised as rapidly as possible. As the moisture, 

 however, is in such cases brought in contact with carbon at 

 a high temperature, it may, by decomposition, cause some of 

 the carbon to be carried off, and thus raise the estimate of the 

 volatile matter above what it would be, if more slowly con- 

 ducted. Incineration was conducted in a muffle, at a high 

 and long continued temperature. 



The following are the results of the analysis of some of 

 these coals : 



Dr. Chaloner referred to the question agitated of late 

 among medical men, whether muscular action could excite 

 electricity, and cited the case of a lady, described in Silli- 

 man's Journal ; a similar instance had come under his own 

 notice in this city. 




March, 1S42.] 157 



As connected with this subject, Professor Johnson mentioned 

 that some years since, he had made experiments with a deli- 

 cate magnet, in suspension, and discovered that by bringing 

 the hands nearly in contact with each other, and then care- 

 fully withdrawing them in opposite directions, the fingers of 

 the different hands, when approximated to the magnet, pro- 

 duced different effects. 



BUSINESS BY SPECIAL RESOLUTION. 



By special permission, the reports of the following com- 

 mittees were read and adopted. 



The report of the committee on Dr. Morton's paper on the 

 so-called Pigmy race of the Valley of the Mississippi, and also 

 his paper on the ancient Peruvian race: in favour of publica- 

 tion. 



The report of the committee on Prof. Johnson's paper enti- 

 tled "Remarks on the relation between the Coal of South 

 Wales and some Pennsylvania Anthracites ;" and also his 

 " Description of an apparatus illustrative of the laws of Che- 

 mical combination, and of the combining volumes of gaseous 

 substances ;" in favour of publication. 



Dr. Elwyn offered the following resolution, which was 

 adopted : 



Resolved, That the Committee of Publication be authorised 

 to present to Charles Lyell, Esq., Corresponding member, the 

 sixth volume of the Journal of the Academy.

 Mrs. Lucy W. Say, dated March 14th, 1842, acknowledging 

 the receipt of her notice of election as a life member of the 

 Academy. 



Vereal Communications. Dr. Goddard stated that he 

 had successfully repeated an improvement in M. Daguerre's 

 process, by which an instantaneous impression of the object 

 may be taken ; consisting in applying a spark of electricity to 

 the back of the plate. The positive spark appeared to be more 

 effectual than the negative.

MEETING FOR BUSINESS, March, 29th, 1S42. 



Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



The Monthly Report of the Corresponding Secretary having 

 been read and adopted, reports were presented from the fol- 

 lowing committees. 



The committee on Dr. George C. Leib's paper entitled, 

 "Description of the Nest and Eggs of the Fulica Americana 

 and Anas discors," in favour of publication. 



The committee on Mr. Haldeman's paper " On two new 

 species of Cyclops;" in favour of publication. 



The committee on the several papers of Mr. Audubon and 

 Dr. Bachman, entitled "Descriptions of new species of North 

 American Quadrupeds;" in favour of publication. 



The Zoological Committee then read the following Report 

 in relation to the condition of the collection of Insects lately 

 returned by Dr. T. W. Harris; which was ordered to be pub- 

 lished in the Proceedings of the Academy. 



The Zoological Committee report, that they have examined 

 the collection of insects belonging to the Academy, which 




March, 1842.] 161 



was sent to Dr. T. VV. Harris, of Cambridge, Mass., in the 

 year 1837, for the purpose of being re-arranged, determined, 

 and having the specimens of Mr. Thomas Say intercalated in 

 their appropriate places, and find that the insects have been 

 returned in so confused and ruined a condition as to render 

 them almost valueless ; that there is not a single insect 

 determined, except those by Dr. McMurtrie prior to the col- 

 lection having been sent to Dr. Harris, and that the species 

 in Mr. Say's collection have been in no instance intercalated t 



They further report, that as the greatest care was taken in 

 the carriage of the cases from the vessel to the Hall of the 

 Academy, on hand-barrows, the specimens could have sus- 

 tained no injury subsequent to their arrival in Philadelphia. 



The committee cannot refrain from expressing their regret 

 that if Dr. Harris, for whatever cause, declined the fulfilment 

 of his engagement to the Academy with respect to this col- 

 lection, that he did not at once return it, in order that it might 

 receive such attention as would have secured its value unim- 

 paired ; especially since he was duly notified of various reso- 

 lutions and inquiries, expressive of the anxiety felt for its safe 

 return.

Description of two new species of Cypris, and a genus of 

 Sterelmintha presumed to be new. By S. S. Haldeman, 

 Read March 22, 1S42. 



Cypris discolor. Elevated, base nearly straight, equally rounded at both ends: 

 an irregular mottling of blackish immediately behind the eye; a raiher smaller 

 blotch of reddish brown at the anterior extremity, and a large one of the same 

 color at the posterior extremity, occupying about one-fifih of the entire surface. 



Variety. The central spot is sometimes reddish, and the posterior one divided 

 into two. Length 0.5 millim.; heighth compared with the length, as 5 to 7. 

 Hab. : in great abundance, a log-pond at the mouth of the Chicquesalunga, on 

 the Susquehanna. 



Cypris vitrea. Translucent, with a tinge of yellow, elongated, nearly straight 

 both ends nearly alike, but the posterior slope is somewhat flattened : about one 

 third of the heighth and length along the dorsal margin, is stained light green : 

 eye obsolete : length 0.5 millim. Hab. : with the preceding, but is comparatively 

 rare. Rather more slender than C. simplex, Hald. 



Hydrolimax. Body slender, limaciform, parenchymatous, provided with vibrilse 

 (cilia) without tentacles or eyes, a posterior nucous pore ! mouth subterminal, 

 bellshaped when expanded. Lives upon mud at the bottom of quiet water : pro- 

 gression as in Limax. 



Hydr. grisea. Half an inch long, mottled grey above ; colorless below, and 

 upon each side of the anterior extremity, where the grey of the back is suddenly 

 narrowed. Hab. : with the preceding species. Bears a striking resemblance to 

 a large grey Limax (L. togata;, Gould), found in Pennsylvania and Virginia.

Letters were read 



From Mr. William Vaughan, dated London, March 5, 

 1842, stating that he had transmitted a parcel to the Academy, 

 from the Linnean Society of London : 



From M. de Longchamps, dated Liege, April 1 5th, 1841, in 

 relation to the books presented this evening; and also express- 

 ing a wish to obtain Part. I. of Vol. VIII. of the Journal of the 

 Academy. A list was likewise given of various insects and 

 animals, which he was desirous of exchanging for similar ob- 

 jects of this country : 



And from George R. Gliddon,Esq. dated New York, April 

 24, 1842, stating that he has presented to the Academy a col- 

 lection of Geological and other specimens from Egypt : and 

 also acknowledging the receipt of his notice of the election as 

 Correspondent of the Academy. 



VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Dr. Chaloner stated, that he had been informed by a gen- 

 tleman from Washington county, Pennsylvania, who had re- 

 cently returned from Central America, and had there met 

 with Messrs. Stevens and Catherwood, that these latter had 

 discovered the remains of another city, covering an area of 

 about six miles square. 



The ruins were in a good state of preservation ; and some 

 specimens of sculpture brought thence by him, evince marks 

 of much skill and beauty. 



The beam of wood referred to in Stevens's Central America, 

 and found in the ruins of Uxmal, was stated to be well pre- 

 served. The tree from which the wood is derived, is called 

 by the natives Zapadillo. It is more durable than live oak 

 or red cedar, sinks in water, and when polished, resembles 

 Partridge wood,' but is darker and harder. 




Mat, 1S42.] 169 



Dr. Chaloner made inquiry with regard to some Infusoria 

 said to have been discovered in the green sediment of pools ; 

 and which are stated to possess the peculiar property of evolv- 

 ing oxygen gas under the influence of the sun's rays. 



When examined by the microscope, they rose to the sur- 

 face, emitted a bubble of gas and then subsided. This gas, 

 collected in an inverted jar, was found on analysis to yield 

 about 80 per cent, of oxygen. 



Dr. B. H. Coates then made some remarks on the progress 

 of discovery in relation to this class of animals ; and called the 

 attention of the members to the late work of Mr. Pritchard, 

 and communicated some of the information which he had 

 derived from this author. 



Dr. Bridges remarked that, in relation to the first mentioned 

 discovery, in the absence of more definite information, the 

 facts which had been communicated would lead us to suppose 

 that the subjects of observation were of a vegetable nature ; 

 since it is well known that vegetables under the influence of 

 the sun's rays, evolve oxygen by the decomposition of car- 

 bonic acid, which is always present in the atmosphere and in 

 water. He also alluded to the difficulty of discrimination 

 between animal and vegetable bodies, especially in micros- 

 copic objects, and made reference to a paper on the Sponge, 

 in one of the late numbers of the Transactions of the Linnean 

 Society, to illustrate the great accuracy of observation re- 

 quired in these cases.

The following resolution was adopted :

172 [ May, 1842. 



those of this country ; and also appending a catalogue of the 

 minerals at present in his possession. 



VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Dr. Goddard stated, that he believed the genus of Infusoria, 

 referred to by Dr. Chaloner at the last meeting, to be Closte- 

 rium, and that it possessed much resemblance to vegetable 

 matter ; the most positive proof of which was, that upon the 

 application of iodine to the interior of the supposed animals, 

 a blue colour was produced. 



The evolution of oxygen gas was an additional proof of 

 their vegetable origin. 



In reference to the donation of Fossil Woods made this 

 evening, Dr. Goddard also adverted to the belief usually enter- 

 tained of the Exogenous specimens being confined exclusively 

 to the Coniferae, and observed that most of those on the table 

 evidently possessed this character; others however belonged 

 to the Endogenae. 



Mr. Gliddon entered into some particulars respecting the 

 localities from which a large portion of the donations made 

 by him this evening, was derived. 



Mr. Gliddon also, in reply to a request from Prof. Rogers 

 for information respecting Boulder formations in Egypt, 

 observed, that these Boulders were found about 200 miles 

 above Cairo, scattered in great numbers over the Desert, 

 lying upon limestone; and appeared to consist principally of 

 sandstone, the surface being much darker than the interior 

 of the stone. Mr. Gliddon having suggested to the Society, 

 the advantages which it might derive for obtaining more defi- 

 nite information on this and other geological subjects, from 

 communicating with the Egyptian Society at Cairo, it was, 

 on motion, 



liesolved, That a Committee of three be appointed to 




May, 1842.] 173 



draft a series of queries to be addressed to the Egyptian Soci- 

 ety at Cairo, with reference to the geology of Egypt. 



The Committee consists of Prof. Rogers, Dr. Morton, and 

 Mr. Taylor. 



The Society also passed a vote of thanks to Mr. Gliddon 

 for his donation, and the valuable and interesting information 

 afforded by him this evening.

MEETING FOR BUSINESS, May 31, 1S42. 



Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



The Report of the Corresponding Secretary for the last 

 month was read and adopted. 



The Committee to whom was referred the following com- 

 munication from Mr. S. S. Haideman, read Feb. 1, 1842, re- 

 ported in favour of publication in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy. 



A spirit of selfishness has crept into Zoology, which looks rather to the advan- 

 tage of the individual, than to the advancement of ihe science ; and authors, with 

 the former point in view, have invented various methods to carry out the princi- 

 ple ; and, what is worse, authority brings those to practice them, who would 

 have been shocked at the idea of using them in the first instance. Among these, 

 I count the practice of citing one's own name for a genus or species founded by 

 another, on the strength of varying a single letter, or even the gender. Examples 

 of this occur in the writings of Rafinesque. If this is proper, a printer may as- 

 sume the authoiship of a book in which he finds and corrects grammatical errors. 

 Admit the principal that Unio metanevra, Kaf. shall be called U. metannever, 

 Lea : and the French will have our own authority to assume almost every species 

 of American Unio, because they consider them as of the feminine gender, whilst 

 they have been described here as masculine ; and any one not a botanist, may 

 place the species of Potamogston (heretofore considered neuter) in the feminine 

 gender to which it belongs, as has been ascertained from a passage in Pliny. 



Having recently looked over the list of American Unionidffi, I wish to propose 

 a few corrections in nomenclature, before they arc made, and the species appro- 

 priated abroad, by someone who will not cite the original desciiber. A western con- 

 cbologist gives all the species of Alasmodon to Mr. Lea, not because he was the 

 first to name them, to create thegenu, or to place them in it; but because he places 

 them in the same genus with those who first described them, but under a differ- 




May, 1S42.] 177 



ent name, which has neither priority nor sense to recommend it ; and which, 

 under other circumstances, this author would probably have rejected, if we may 

 judge from the fact that he adopts the names Physa and Planorbis, rather than 

 Bulinus and Coretus. The same principle would deprive Mr. Lea of all his spe- 

 cies of Alasmodon ; for assuredly authors will not adopt Shumacher's name (or 

 this genus, when so much a better one is in general use. Generic nomenclature 

 is not, and never has been, subjected to the rigid rule of priority which species 

 require; and a name founded upon the generic peculiarity will generally be adop- 

 ted in preference to others. A fossil animal with a head unlike that of a bird, was 

 named Omithocephalus ; it is now called Pterod ictylus. A remarkable mammal 

 with flat feet, and a bill like that of a bird, was first named Platypus, but is now- 

 known by the name Ornithorhynchus* alone. 



To put these matters to the test. I propose that the letter u shall take the place 

 of iv in the specific name of Unio Cowperianus of Lea, this gentleman having 

 committed an error in the orthography. To suit the views of those who do not 

 like the appearance of a name with the termination anus following a genitive, I 

 propose that Couperii be adopted instead of the above. There is an " Anodonta 

 Cowperiana" which I do not correct, because I wish merely to discuss a princi- 

 ple. I propose that all the species of the genus Alasmoiionj- or Alasmodonta, be 

 called by one of these names; and that the hybrid specific name of Unio Nash- 

 villianus be changed into the more correct and classical one of Nashvicensis. Fi- 

 nally, I disclaim all citation for these proposition*, as I think it would be the 

 height of absurdity to cite any one for species he does not know. 



In relation to the communication of Dr. A. Clapp, of New 

 Albany, Indiana, read March 8th, 1S42, the Committee con- 

 sisting of Mr. Conrad, Prof. Rogers and Mr. Vanuxem, re- 

 ported the following for publication in the Proceedings: 



A letter was read from Dr. A. Clapp of New Albany, Indiana, dated February 

 25ih, in relation to the Geological equivalents of the rocks of the Falls of the 

 Ohio, and other strata in the Western States. 



The author states, that, the'e appears to be little or no true carboniferous lime- 

 stone east of the Falls of the Ohio. The stratum which he doubtfully referred to 

 it, in a previous letter of December, 1840, viz the Oolitic and Pentremile lime- 

 stone of Professor Troost and Dr. Owen, he is now convinced is the carboniferous 

 limestone, commencing a short distance west of New Albany, and underlying the 

 coal formation in the western part of Indiana, part of Kentucky and Illinois. It 

 is entirely wanting in Ohio. 



He refers to his previous communication of April last, as showing that the 

 limestone of the Falls of the Ohio, the cliff limestone of Professor Locke, does 

 not belong to the Carboniferous, but to the Upper Siluiian System of Murchison. 

 The limestone of the Falls immediately underlies the black bituminous slate, 

 which appears to be the equivalent of the Marcellus shales of New York. The 

 lower strata of the Falls have many fossils of the Weulock limestone, but the 



* The middle h is sometimes omitted, as it was by Linneus in his genus Ryn- 

 chops. Is the first author who made the omission, and he who first wrote Rliyn- 

 chops, entitled to these genera, with their species ? In a notice of Kiener's work, 

 in the Re\U' Zoologique, this author is censured for writing " Pleurotonia mitrs% 

 formis Fell," Wond having previously used the specific name " mitrj'formis." 



j This ;s the more correct form, and corresponds with .Mono. Ion, Ifvodon, Dio- 

 don, etc. 




178 [May, 1S42. 



upper, particularly the water lime, has also many of the Ludlow. The lower and 

 middle portions of the Cliff limestone, he conjectures to be equivalents of the Ni- 

 agara limestone and Gypseous shales : the entire mass called the Cliff limestone, 

 represents therefore the Niagara limestone, Gypseous shales, water-lime, Ononda- 

 ga limestone, &c. to the Marcellus shales. Under the name Cliff limestone is 

 here included all the group above the blue limestone and marls of Cincinnati, to 

 the black slate. It is the western continuation of the middle Silurian series of 

 Mr. Conrad. 



The water-lime of the Falls of the Ohio, is a drab-coloured rock, from ten to 

 fourteen feet thick, covered by a subcrystalline foetid limestone eight feet thick, 

 containing Enerini, a Conu/aria, Delthyris and Favosites, and a few other co- 

 rals, and immediately underlies the black slate. In mast places the water-lime is 

 entirely destitute of organic remains ; the few which occur belong to the lower 

 Ludlow and Amestry of Murchison, as Orthis hmata vel reticularis, leptxna 

 lata ? Turbo carinatus, Terebra sinuosa, Tentaculites, perhaps a new species, 

 Avicula reticulata, Calymene bufo, Aaaphus Micrurus; several undetermined 

 species of Delthyris, an Eschara, &c. 



In the strata below the water-lime were f mnd many fossils of the Wenlock 

 limestone, Strophomena euglypha, Atrypa prisca, the latter also occurring in 

 the water-lime and upper limestone; Pleurorynchtts cureous? of Conrad, and 

 an immense profusion of Polyparia, characteristic of the Wenlock limestone. 



The Catamepora occurs below the main mass of the corals, and thirty or forty 

 feet below the water-lime. It would therefore appear, that the water-lime belongs 

 to the middle or upper part of the Hederburg group, and cannot represent the 

 Onondaga salt group of Mr. Hall. 



The author expresses a doubt of the identity of the black bituminous slate of 

 Ohio, with the Ludlowville group of Mr. Hall, as supposed by that gentleman. 

 Though the shales and sandstone in the vicinity of New Albany, for more than 

 four hundred feet above the black slate, are destitute of fossils, except a few in- 

 distinct Fucoides, yet sixteen miles south, in Kentucky, great quantities of Cri- 

 noidiea occur, fifty or one hundred feet above the slate; and an Orthis which 

 Mr. Hall consideis identical with a species of the Ludlowville shale of New York.

WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS. 



The Chairman read a letter from Mr. S. S. Haldeman, dated 

 Marietta, Pennsa., May 17, 1842, enclosing communications 

 intended for publication in the Proceedings of the Academy, 

 viz : descriptions of a new Species of Cypris, of two species 

 of Hydrachnse, and of two Entomostraca. 



In this letter Mr. Haldeman stated the singular fact of his 

 having observed, " in a small pond two feet in diameter and 

 two inches deep, no less than thirty species of animal form ; 

 including two Crustacea, four Entomostraca, nine Mollusca, 

 one Annelid, two Hydrachnas, and about a dozen aquatic 

 larvae." 



The communications were referred to a committee, consist- 

 ing of Mr. Phillips, Dr. Goddard and Dr. Morton. 



A letter was also read from Dr. Corson, dated Conshehock- 

 en, June 10, 1842, accompanying his donation. 



VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Professor Rogers called the attention of the members to the 

 recent earthquake in St. Domingo, remarkable for its severity 

 and the great destruction of life and property. He alluded to 




182 [June, 1842. 



the evidence which the recent accounts from the West Indies 

 furnish, of the general correctness of the hypothesis, originally 

 advanced by Michell, in the Philosophical Transactions for 

 1760, that the movement of the earth in earthquakes is undu- 

 latory. That such is the nature of the motion may be con- 

 sidered indeed as established, both from observation in many 

 regions of the globe, and from instrumental investigations 

 now in progress in Scotland. Professor Rogers proposes to 

 explain the billowy oscillation of the ground, by actual waves 

 engendered on the surface of the great fluid lava-mass, sup- 

 posed to occupy the whole interior of the globe ; and he ac- 

 counts for the waves, by the sudden or explosive escape of 

 highly compressed vapours, by the rending of the crust, or 

 through other outlets. 



He suggested to the Society the importance of procuring, 

 through correspondence on the part of members, some more 

 detailed and accurate statements than have yet appeared in the 

 public prints, in relation to the phenomena of the late shocks 

 in the West Indies ; as regards, 



First. The extent of the earthquake ; whether it reached 

 the mainland of South America, and to what distance north- 

 ward from Porto Rico and St. Domingo it was felt at sea. 



Secondly. The direction of the undulations and accompa- 

 nying concussions. 



Thirdly. The precise time at each locality of the occur- 

 rence of the first shock, and of each principal succeeding one. 



Fourthly. Whether the cloud of vapour reported to have 

 been seen at Port Plate, on the north-east coast of St. Domin- 

 go, was actually such, or merely dust, caused by disturbance 

 of the soil or the crushing of falling buildings.

Dr. Goddard remarked, in reference to the inflated lung 

 presented this evening, that it offered a very good type of the 

 lobule of the human lung ; and that although each lobule of the 

 latter was isolated and distinct from all the rest, its air cells 

 communicated freely with each other; a fact, the discovery of 

 which was due to Professor Horner.

MEETING FOR BUSINESS, June 28th, 1842. 



Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



The committee, consisting of Mr. Phillips, Dr. Goddard, and 

 Dr. Morton, to whom were referred the following communica- 

 tions of Mr. Haldeman, reported in favour of publication in the 

 Proceedings. 



Description of two species of Entomostraca and two Hy- 

 drachnae, by S. S. Haldeman. 



Daphnia abrupta. Body short, irregular in outline, back but slightly convex, 

 meeting the head at a slight depression, and the posterior extremity with a curve 

 of a quarter of a circle ; posterior margin running downwards and forwards, with 

 a rounded projection opposite the head ; ventral margin very convex. Colour, 

 brown ; length, 2 millim. Hab. Ditches along the Susquehanna. 



LiMNADrA coriacea. Body lengthened; swimming branchiae extending along 

 three-fourths of the inferior surface, from the neck to the extremity of the tail; 

 tail crested above with a row of large conical obtuse tubercles ; apex of the shell 

 elevated, and about one-fourth of the length from the anterior extremity ; colour, 

 light brown; length 5 millim., height 3, diam. 1^. Hab. Ditches along the Sus- 

 quehanna, in quiet water. 



Obs. The shell is coriaceous and translucent, and bears a slight resemblance 

 to Mesodesma Jauresii. It is not a little singular that the same generic and spe- 

 cific name, Limnadia gigas, should have been applied both to a crustacean and 

 a mollusc, each of which has a bivalve shell, andinhabits fresh water. 



Hydrachna scabra. Subglobose, dull vermillion red, displaying a rough papil- 

 lated surface under the microscope ; legs ciliated, some of the bristles extremely 

 long; claws simple, retractile ; length 1| millim. Hab. Quiet waters along the 

 Susquehanna. Swims well, and occasionally leaves the water for the damp earth. 



Hydrachna bundata. Subglobular, light ochraceous, clouded with light yellowish 

 brown ; there are five blood-red spots, placed respectively between the eyes, at the 

 posterior extremity, upon the margin of each side, and in the middle of the body; 

 legs long, slender, and ciliated. Length 1 millim. Extremely active, swimming 

 through the water with great rapidity. Occurs with the preceding species. 



Description of a new species of Cypris. By S. S. Halde- 

 man. 



Cypris scabra. Shell modioliform, rough, inflated, thickly covered with bristles ; 

 colour (of the dead shell,) pale livid, or corneus. Length 1 1, height 1 millimetre. 

 Hab. A small pond near Cambridge, Mass. It resembles Modiola nexa some- 

 what, in outline. 



The committee on Dr. Zantzinger's paper, containing a 

 Tabular Statement of Meteorological observations for the year 




July, 1842.] 185 



1841, reported in favour of publication in the Journal of the 

 Academy. 



The Corresponding Secretary read his Report for the last 

 month.

Mr. Phillips, from the Committee on the Proceedings report- 

 ed the following Resolution, which, on motion, was adopted : 



Resolved, That when the Committee on the Proceedings 

 consider it unadvisable to publish a communication in the 

 form in which it has been received, they may decline it, unless 

 it can be modified to their satisfaction, with the consent of the 

 author ; but in case of his absence, they shall refer the pro- 

 posed alterations to the Academy.

 nea ; and of one Daphnia, D. reticulata," which was referred 

 to a committee, consisting of Drs. Goddard, McMurtrie and 

 Pickering. 



VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Professor Johnson made some remarks on the determination 

 of copper in analysis. He stated that the usual mode was to pre- 

 cipitate the protoxide from solution; that in this case, it is neces- 

 ary that an excess of alkali should be added, and the precipitate 

 well washed. It is also attended by a loss in filtering, &c. 

 By using dry sulphate of copper these objections are obviated. 

 This salt is readily dried without decomposition; and Professor 

 Johnson stated that with the same portion of copper he re- 

 peated an experiment several times, and had found this mode 

 of determination more satisfactory than that by the oxide, and 

 with less variation in result. 



Mr. Haldeman then made the following remarks. 



From the great number of generic names required in Zoolo- 



27 




188 [July, 1842. 



gy and Botany, it frequently happens that the same name will 

 occur, not only in both these sciences, but will be occasionally 

 used for different genera in one or the other kingdom. No 

 principle is perhaps better established than that which denies 

 the same name to different genera ; and it is necessary, there- 

 fore, that those concerned in the construction of generic 

 nomenclature, should look over the names already instituted, 

 as a safeguard against a double emploi. Thus Cenchrus and 

 Apogon are genera in both kingdoms. 



I wish, therefore, to propose a few changes in the names 

 of several genera, viz : 



Anojmia, instead of Harpyia, Cuv., for a genus of birds, the 

 latter name being preoccupied, both in Mammalogy and En- 

 tomology. 



Oplacerus, instead of Mazama, Smith ; this name having 

 been pre-applied to Ovis or Capra montana, Ord, by Rafin- 

 esque. 



Sargus, was long since applied to a genus of dipterous in- 

 sects by Illiger : Cuvier more recently, upon dismembering 

 the genus Sparus of Artedi and Linnaaus, improperly adopted 

 it for the typical section, to which, therefore, the original 

 name Sparus must be applied. 



Lynx, (a subgenus of Felis,) was published by Rafinesque 

 in 1817, and I believe has the priority of Lynchus, which is 

 also the name of a genus of Crustacea.

WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS. 



Mr. Haldeman read the following additional Remarks on 

 Changes of Nomenclature in Natural History, which were 

 referred to Dr. Morton, Dr. Bridges and Mr. Phillips as a 

 committee, who reported in favour of publication in the Pro- 

 ceedings.

 latter as the right os fomoris of Chelonia Couperi. 




July, 1842.] l^J 



In continuation of my observations on the use of the same name for different 

 genera, I would remark that it is possible, in many instances, to vary the later 

 one so slightly, that it would be essentially the same; and, to prevent confusion, 

 the name of the author who instituted the genus, might be cited for it.* These 

 variations might take place either in the orthography, in the gender, or by a 

 diminitive. Linnams himself has set us an example, in applying such names as 

 Picus and Pica to distinct genera of birds. 



But in making changes of this kind, it is very necessary to be careful that great 

 confusion be not the result. Thus, Bonaparte has proposed ' Pogonathus, Bon." 

 in place of" Pogonias, Cuv." because the latter is applied to a genus of birds. Yet 

 if we turn to the Regne Animal, we will find " Pogonias' Lacep." We do not, 

 however, find Pogonias in Lacepede, the name being Pogonathus. 



I propose Ancyllus and Teronyx, instead of Ancylus and Trionyx, for genera of 

 Hymenoptera. 



Conoura, Eucryptus and Auchenella, instead of Conurus, Cryptus, (Hal.) and 

 Auchenia, for genera of insects. 



Clypastrsea and Strong ulus, instead of Clypeaster and Strongylus, for coleopte- 

 rous genera. 



Cymindus, instead of Cymindis, for a genus of birds; and Labeola instead of 

 Labeo, for a genus of insects. There are many other names employed for dis- 

 tinct genera ; thus Chione, Venilia, Cleodora, Pandora, Hyria and Lucina, are 

 common to conchology and entomology ; Sylvia and Tanagra to the latter and 

 ornithology ; and Labeo and Zytena to entomology and ichthyology. 



The following " Note on the Natural Alliances of the genus 

 Cecidomyia, intended to facilitate identification ;" was read by 

 Dr. B. H. Coates, and referred to a committee, viz. : Dr. 

 McMurtrie, Dr. Pickering, and Mr. Haldeman ; who reported 

 it for publication in the Proceedings of the Academy. 



Nothing new is professed to be furnished by the present paragraphs. They are 

 compiled from sources not difficult of access among the liberal collections of this 

 city ; but it has been hoped that some utility could be derived from preserving and 

 more widely diffusing a memorandum of the^alliances of this destructive family of 

 insects, so as to increase the number and practicability of observations on the part 

 of those favourably situated for that purpose. 



The old Linnean genus, Tipula, is, I believe, a natural one. It is, at all events, 

 one of a striking appearance. A delicate, lightly framed, two winged fly, of a 

 form much resembling the moschito, frequently capable of resting and dancing on 

 running streams of water, so as to attract popular attention by the circumstance, 

 and at the same time unable to inflict severe and penetrating wounds on the bodies 

 of warm-blooded animals, from the feebleness of its proboscis. This organ would 

 seem, in general, only fitted for sucking up uncovered or but slightly covered fluids ; 

 and contains, to use the language of one of the best authorities, only a pair of lan- 

 cets ; being, in this respect, very deficient when compared with the allied family, 

 Culicida;. The antennae, with the exception of a single sub-family, are thread- 

 shaped. The perfect insect shows but little avidity for food. 



Five natural groups seem to arise; in each of which the appearance of the per- 



* Cuvier writes " Machoera, Lacep." but this genus stands Makaira, in 

 Lacepede's work, and it is the more necessary to retain the original orthography, 

 as Machcerahas been recently applied to a genus of Mollusca.

192 [July, 1842. 



feet insect visibly differs, and the habits of the larva vary materially in respect to 

 food and habitation. We copy some of the characters. 



1. Chirnomides. Aquatic Tipulides. Male antennae plumose ; larva) aquatic. 



2. Tipulides proper. Terrestrial Tipulides. Head elongated into a muzzle; 

 no ocelli ; larva? inhabit the earth. 



3. Mycetophilides. Tipulides of fungi. Two or three ocelli ; trochanters 

 elongated ; tibiae strongly spurred ; larva? feed on fungi. 



4. Cecidomyides. Tipulides of gall-nuts. Head not prolonged into a muzzle ; 

 no ocelli ; trochanters of ordinary length ; antenna? moniliform ; larva? feed in 

 galls formed on vegetable substances. 



5. Bibionides. Tipulides of flowers. Antenna? short, perfoliatcd, generally fewer 

 than 12 joints ; legs of ordinary length ; larva? often resident in rotten dung 

 and vegetable debris. [To me, this seems contradictory.] 



The above classification is quoted from M. Latreille ; and is preferred by the 

 author whom I have already cited, and whom I believe to be Mr. Westwood. The 

 less extensive knowledge of the species possessed in the years when Messrs. Meigen 

 and Lamarck wrote, prevented their distribution of the family from being, at that 

 time, so perfect. They are compelled, in this place, to follow a more artificial 

 method ; and have thus brought in close approximation some animals whose mode 

 of life has subsequently been thought to differ. It has since been thought to be 

 rendered evident, that the larva? of the proper tipulida?, at least as a general rule, 

 live on the roots of plants. Among the authorities cited for this are Kirby and 

 Spcnce. 



It is evident that the natural affinities of Cecidomyia, are with the sub-family 

 to which it has given its name. It has been approximated to Lasioptera. The 

 latter is a genus with terrestrial larva?, living on roots ; and the parent, according 

 to professor Meigen, not furnished with an ovipositor. The figures, too, given by 

 the latter writer as specimens of the genera, differ in their habitus. In the earlier 

 state of knowledge in relation to the tipulide tribe, and particularly while the lar- 

 va? were less known, the collocation of several species was doubtful. Mr. Meigen 

 is said to place the tipula juniperina L., which inhabits the tops of the juniper, 

 " doubtfully in Lasioptera." 1 understand the words " unbekannte horde," under 

 which he introduces this species, to mean " unknown, or ill-understood horde," or 

 " unknown, ill-defined group." 



it is observed that every larva of the family, thus fur, appears to consume solid 

 substances by chewing, and, as a necessary inference, to possess real jaws; instead 

 of sucking by a trunk, as has been, in this country, universally affirmed of the 

 species so frequently the subject of popular discussion. The consideration goes to 

 strengthen, if possible, the inference that the quiescent substance generally sup- 

 posed, in imitation of Mr. Say, to be the larva of the Hessian fly, and which, by 

 the avowal of that distinguished writer, so closely resembles the pupa, is really the 

 pupa in an earlier stage, and that the larva is to be looked for in the maxillated 

 and gnawing worm. 



It appears to be every where observed, that as soon as these animals increase 

 to a certain extent, their further diffusion is immediately limited by the ravages 

 of the different parasites of the families Chalcidida? and Proctotrupida?. The 

 coincidence of these diminutions, from a cause not generally understood, with 

 various other circumstances affecting the wheat crops, probably gives reputation 

 to many other supposed means, natural and artificial, of destroying the injurious

VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Dr. Chaloner exhibited a specimen of a small Trilobite, said 

 to have been taken from a coal excavation at the Bear Gap, 

 about 14 miles from Pottsville, Pa., along with the fern im- 

 pressions so numerous in such excavations. Some doubts 

 were expressed by Dr. Chaloner as to the correctness of his 

 informant. He was desirous, however, of calling the attention 

 of the members to the subject. 



In relation to the donation of Minerals this evening, Mr. J. 

 A. Clay remarked, that they exhibited in a striking manner, 

 the identity of certain Magnesian minerals of the U. States, 

 and especially of those of Chester county, Pennsylvania, with 

 the Picrosmine, Metaxite, &c. of Europe.

MEETING FOR BUSINESS, July 26, 1842. 



Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



After the reading of the Monthly Report of the Corrrespond- 

 ing Secretary, the following reports of committees were pre- 

 sented and adopted. 



The Committee on the following paper by Mr. Haldeman, 

 read July 5th, 1842, in favour of Publication in the Proceed- 

 ings. 



Description of two new species of Hydrachna and one of 

 Daphnia. By S. S. Haldeman. 



Hydr. nebulosa. Globular, mottled with brown ; a large central sub-rectangu- 

 lar spot back of the eyes, which are apparently double upon each side, red and 

 black ; an orange spot in the centre of the back ; legs very slender, first and 

 second pair thinner than the third and fourth ; palpi long, basal half cylindrical, 

 extremity tapering. More globular than my Unionicola oviformis, with a nearly 

 similar light Y shaped mark upon the back, and equalling this species in size. 

 Hab. A little pond on the Susquehanna, above Columbia. 



Hydr. coccinea. Subglobose, uniform bright scarlet, legs slender, covered with 

 short bristles ; palpi bristled, ante-penultimate articulation thickened. Length 4 

 millim. Hab. with the preceding. Differs from H. scabra, in being larger, and 

 in wanting the long bristles to the legs. The posterior legs are not " destitute of 

 cilia," wherein it differs from Limnochares cxtendens, Say. 



Daphnia reticulata. Ovate, margins imbricated, surface divided by fine lines 

 into minute rectangles; posterior half of the body with the dorsal and ventral por- 

 tion approaching each other by similar curves, which meet in a long, slender, 

 tapering caudal appendage. Closely resembles " Monocculus pulex." Jurine's 

 Hist, des Monocles, PI. 8. fig. 1. Length 1 millim. Hab. with the preceding. 



The Committee on Professor Locke's communication, read 

 July 5th, 1842, on the Fossil Cryptolithus tesselatus, re- 

 ported also in favour of publication in the Proceedings ; viz : 



So rarely do we meet with Fossils in such a state that we can unravel in any 

 degree the structure beyond the mere external form, that I sit down while the 

 subject is still new and exciting, to communicate to you what seems to me to be a 

 discovery in relation to the Cryptolithus tessellatus. This fossil is so seldom found 

 with anything more than the scuta and its ornamented margin, that some natu- 

 ralists have doubted the existence of an " abdomen" and " tail," similar to the cor- 

 responding parts of other trilobites. In examining a stratum of clay-marl which 




July, 1842.] 197 



constitutes, perhaps, a hundred feet in thickness of our horizontal strata, the fos- 

 sils were found to be merely imbedded, without petrefaction, and easily separable 

 from the fine, soft, earthy matter. In this condition, they exhibit a freshness and 

 sharpness highly interesting to the student. Within the last week, Mr^sJames 

 Foster, an amateur collector of our city, discovered in this marl several specimens 

 of the above fossil, with the body entire. Soon after, Mr. Anthony and myself 

 found other specimens of the same. The new facts disclosed by these specimens 

 and by others found in this vicinity, are 1st. That the animal was furnished when 

 entire, with very long spines or processes from the posterior angles of the shield. 

 2d. The abdomen is partly concealed, about five articulations, under the poste- 

 rior half of the shield. 3d. The middle lobe of the shield is posteriorly mucro- 

 nate. The first fact is fully exhibited in a specimen in Mr. Foster's cabinet ; the 

 second fact in a specimen of my own, in which the shield lias separated from the 

 body, disclosing the articulations beneath ; the third fact in two specimens be- 

 longing to Mr. Foster. The middle lobe of the abdomen is about half the width 

 of the lateral lobes, and shows only five or six articulations uncovered by the shield. 

 The tail is very distinct from the abdomen, with about five obscure articulations. 

 Mr. Anthony has a specimen, which by a fracture of the shield, discloses seven 

 abdominal articulations, and the whole number is probably ten. It is evident, 

 from this structure, that when the animal rolled itself in the manner of the trilo- 

 bite family, the whole body would be concealed under the shield. The posterior 

 part of the body is circumscribed by a well defined raised margin. 



The associated fossils are Strophomcna alternata, Atrypa tcstudinaria, Lingula 



, Orbicula, Isotelus megistos, Calymene senaria, Grthocerce, Enchrinites and 



Corallines. Formation, " Blue limestone," Trenton Limestone of the N. Y. 

 Geologists, or a formation above it. 



The Committee, to whom was referred the communication 

 of P. A. Browne, Esq., describing a " monstrous Rose," made 

 a report, stating that the difference in the character of this 

 paper from the usual one of those inserted in the Journal cr 

 Proceedings, and the necessity for the aid of a plate for its 

 complete elucidation, rendered its publication, in its entire form, 

 impracticable. 



The following, however, being the concluding portion of the 

 paper, containing some strictures on terms used in Vegetable 

 Physiology, the Committee recommended for publication in 

 the Proceedings. 



It remains only to note, that when botanists inculcate the doctrine to which 

 allusion has been made above,* they make use of terms that are illy adapted to 

 convey their meaning. " A flower" they say, " is a transformed branch : all its 

 organs being leaves, which have undergone a peculiar metamorphosis ,"t by which 

 we would understand that nature first formed a branch, and afterwards converted

 leaves.

198 [July, 1842' 



it progressively into a calyx, a corolla, stamens and pistils ; whereas they do not 

 intend to be understood that these parts ever existed as branches or leaves, but 

 that their nature and origin are the same. And this being the case, why are the 

 wordslfrtransformed," and " metamorphosed" used at all ? Terms should never be 

 used in science with different meanings from that in which they are generally 

 understood, if it can possibly be avoided. 



! It is the opinion of some eminent botanists, that the same vegetable matter 

 which, called into action on the earth, with sufficient light, air, &c. produces a 

 Lichen, will, in moisture on decaying organised substances become a Fungus ; 

 or if developed under water, exhibit the form of an Alga. But this has not been 

 considered a sufficient warrant for the assertion, that one of these is transformed 

 or is metamorphosed into the other. 



This erroneous mode of expression is peculiarly conspicuous in regard to the 

 present specimen, since it conveys the idea that the leaves were first transformed 

 into calyx, corolla, stamens and pistils, and were afterwards by a retrograde move- 

 ment metamorphosed back again into leaves ; when in truth all we mean to assert 

 is, that owing to the peculiar circumstances attending the developement of the 

 flower, the vegetable matter which was called into action, never arrived at the 

 stage of perfection required for these more perfect organs, and that therefore they 

 remained leaves. 



The Society then proceeded to an election for Correspon- 

 dents of the xA.cademy, with the following result.

VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Dr. Merlon laid on the taide the remains of a human skeleton found by Mr. 

 J. li Stephens in a vauli or tomb at the ruins near Ticul, nineteen leagues from 

 Merida, in Yucatan. Dr. M. remarked that these bones have pertained to a 

 female, whose stature has not exceeded five feet three inches, at the same time 

 ih;it the absence of epiphyses and consequent consolidation of the bones ar< 

 proof- of adult a'.*e. From the appearance of the teeth, however, which art 

 fresh, and not sensibly worn, and a line or furrow marking off the crista of the 

 ilium, it is pies Um ed that this individual had not passed her twentieth year. 

 The bones of the head, which are still partially separable at the sutures, are 

 admirably characteristic of the American Race, as seen in the vertical occiput 

 and the 'jreat inter-parietal diameter, which measures five inches and ei^ht- 

 tenths. The head is of full size, in proportion to the rest of the skeleton, ol 

 which the bones are of very delicate proportions, especially those of the fee; 

 and hands. An interesting feature of this skeleton is, the occurrence of a 

 large spongy node on the upper and inner surface of the left tibia, on which 

 it extends about two inches in length, one inch in breadth, and halt an inch 

 in thicki ess. Dr. Bridges having subjected some fragments of these bone- 




204 [August, 1842. 



10 the usual chemical tests, found them in a very great degree deprived of 

 animal matter an additional evidence of their antiquity. 



Dr. Morton also exhibited parts of four other skeletons, obtained also in 

 Yucatan, by Mr. Benjamin A. Norman, during a recent sojourn in that coun- 

 try. They were found in mounds near the sea-coast; but on a closer examin- 

 ation, it was ascertained by that gentleman that these mounds had been 

 pyramids of mason work, which, by gradual disintegration, and subsequent 

 deposits of vegetable matter, had been reduced to the low, conical, or mound- 

 like lorm. One of these skeletons is that of a man of perhaps five and twenty 

 years ol age; the bones, which are chiefly those of the extremities, are large, 

 and indicate a person of full stature. The few remaining cranial bones are' 

 large and massive, which remark also applies to both maxilla?, in which the 

 teeth are remarkably perfect. The os calcis and other bones of the foot are 

 of delicate proportions. Parts of a second skeleton from the same mound 

 are smaller, but so few, and so much broken, as to prevent any certain indi- 

 cations of age or sex. 



Of the two remaining skeletons, only a few fragments of long bones and 

 others of the hands and feet remain. These are much larger than those 

 already described, and have probably pertained to men of large stature. No 

 remains of cranial bones were found among them. These fragments were 

 not tested for the animal matter they may contain; but, judging from their 

 extreme disintegration, it must have almost wholly disappeared. 



Mr. Gliddon remarked, on the authority of Mr. Stephens, 

 that an examination of the sepulchre, and of the mode in 

 which these remains had been interred, totally disproved 

 any idea of their being of Egyptian origin or character. 



BUSINESS BY SPECIAL RESOLUTION. 



On motion of Dr. Morton, Resolved, That the Catalogue 

 accompanying Mr. P. A. Browne's donation of West Indian 

 plants, &c, be bound, and deposited in the Library of the 

 Academy.

VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Prof. Johnson exhibited and explained a method of applying the galvano- 

 meter to the purpose of testing the relative deductibility of different samples 

 of sheathing copper when exposed to the action of salt water. He referred 

 ;o tin 1 faci that, in early periods of the use of copper fur sheathing the bot- 

 toms of vessels, while iron bolts were still used for fastenings, the copper 

 lasted much I > >t than al present, while the iron itself was rapidly corn de I; 

 thai pper bolts having been substituted for iron ones, the sheathing exhi- 

 bited :i much more rapid decay than befi .>. He likewise alluded i<> the fact 

 that the practice of fastening on sheathing copper with composition nails, 

 oilers an antagonist electric force to thai i*t' the copper, rendering the latter 

 more highly electro-positive, and thus facilitating its union with the electro- 

 negative elements of sea water. It was also mentioned, that in removing the 

 copper from ships some sheets are often found much more corroded than the 

 rest, and that this takes place among sheets manufactured at the same works, 

 and apparently with equal care in freeing the metal from impurities. 



It v as further mentioned tiiat long experience had evinced the uncertainty 

 if obtaining durable copper by efforts to approximate chemical purity in the 

 manufacture, and that in copper free from other meinls the oxide of copper 

 is sometimes detected both in the interior and on the exterior of the mass, 

 rendering it earihv in appearance, and liable to be disintegrated as well as 

 corroded. In proof of this latter effect he exhibited a quantity of copper 

 particles brushed from a sheet o\ that metal which had been worn 'several 

 feare between the keel and the false keel of an English s| U op of war, where, 

 though ihe salt water could penetrate and corrode it, the disintegrated parti- 

 cles coul I not be reached by the waves to be washed away. 



A> the comparative electric energy of two sheets of copper is proportion 

 to the amount of corrosion going en, and as the quantity of electricity i 

 motion also determines the influence of its current on a magnetic needle, the 

 leflection id' that of a common galvanometer may be made to determin 

 relation of two sheets to each other, and thus io ascertain whether they are 

 uitable to lie associated together on the bottom of ihe same vessel. 



Two methods v. ere described and illn- trated by h hich this may I"' accom- 

 plished. The fust is to oppose iii succession the several sheets of copper t>> 

 a .sheet of platina constituting the negative element of the pair, and observing

n ii 1 were exhibited in connexion wnh several i\ iih 

 nng copper, the specimens which had, by analysis, been shown u 

 le purest copper, exhibiting the highest electro-positive energy when 

 < im pared with platma.and ilie lowest electro-negative power when oppn.sed 

 lo the galvanotype plate. Composition nails were found near platina in the 

 scale, and galvanotype copper not so widely removed from iron as are some 

 varieties of brass. 



The arrangement of apparatus supposed to be best adapted for use in prac- 

 tice, is a triple astatic needle, having its middle needle w ithin, its lower one 

 below, and its tipper one above a spiral of copper ribbon, formed in such a 

 manner as to present the edges of the ribbon lo the upper and under surfaces 

 of the needles. The suspension may be either that of a pivot, or that of a 

 single or double support of unspun silk. The liquid preferred for use, in 

 tins species of lest, is ci minoti sea water; being the same to which practice 

 subjects the sheathins copper, and having the advantage ol being easily pro- 

 cured, costing nothing, and capable, therel re, ol being renewed as often a.-- 

 the operator may think' (it.

A communication was read by the Recording Secretary 

 from Mr. Isaac Lea, dated October 31, 1842, correcting an 

 error committed by Mr. Haldeman in a communication 

 made by the latter to the Academy in May last, and pub- 

 lished in its Proceedings, in which he proposed that " the 

 letter u should take the place of w in the Unio Cowperiana 

 of Lea," on the ground of an error in the orthography. Mr. 



31 




216 [November; 1842. 



Lea stated that the Unio in question was not named after 

 Mr. J. Hamilton Couper of Georgia, as was probably sup- 

 posed by Mr. Haldeman, but after Mr. Wm. Cooper of New 

 York. Mr. Lea also objected to any change in the specific 

 name, and also to Mr. Haldeman's proposed alteration of 

 Unio Nashvillianus to U. Nashvicencis, the latter, in his 

 opinion, not being " more classical and correct." 



The Corresponding Secretary read a letter from J. 

 Hamilton Couper, Esq., of Darien, Georgia, dated Oct. 6, 

 1842, acknowledging the receipt of his notice of election as 

 Correspondent of the Academy; and also transmitting a 

 communication giving a detailed description of the strata, 

 in which the fossil bones and shells from the Brunswick 

 Canal, lately presented by him to the Academy, were found; 

 preceded by a sketch of the geological features of the sur- 

 rounding country. 



The communication was referred to the Committee on 

 Proceedings. 



[The length of this interesting paper will preclude its in- 

 sertion entire in this publication. It will be reserved for 

 the first part of the next volume of the Journal of the Aca- 

 demy. For the present, therefore, the Committee are only 

 enabled to give the following, being the concluding portion 

 of the paper.] 



The fossil bones of the terrestrial mammalia* were found in the bed of the 

 canal, at the southern end of this swamp, at six different points extending up 

 from its junction with the salt marsh to a distance of three miles. In 

 every instance they were found at the bottom of the alluvial deposit, imbed- 

 ded in it, and lying on the stratum of sand. The first two feet of the allu- 

 vial formation is a sandy loam, gradually passing into a compact clay of a 

 ferruginous character, which extends three or four feet deeper. In this 

 stratum of clay thin veins of marl and fragments of petrified wood were 

 found at different depths : but no fossil shells, either of marine or fresh 

 water origin. The stratum of sand on which the bones were found lying 

 is on an average nearly five feet above spring tides. About the line of 



* The most interesting of these bones belong to the Megatherium, the 

 Mastodon giganteum, Elephas primogenius, Hippopotamus, Horse, Bos, and 

 to a nondescript animal, which Dr. Harlan has described as the Sus Ameri- 

 cana, in Silliman's Journal, for July, 1842. 




November, 1842.] 217 



high water the sand changes its color from yellow to white, and assumes 

 a quicksand character, which it retains for one or two feet, when it is suc- 

 ceeded by a coarser and sharper sand, with the occasional occurrence of 

 thin strata of foetid black mud or clay. Small masses of marine fossil 

 shells,* lying horizontally, or nearly so, are found scattered at intervals 

 throughout this sandy formation, at almost every point of the canal. The 

 depth varies from five feet above to five feet below the line of high tides, 

 which is the greatest depth to which the excavation has extended. 



The rib and vertebra of the whale were discovered near the northern 

 extremity of the swamp, in the yellow sand, and about a foot below its sur- 

 face. They were much worn, and one of the vertebra was much incrusted 

 with barnacles. At this point bog iron ore and protophosphate of iron 

 were found above the sand containing the marine shells. 



The precise spot where the extinct Chelonia (C. Couperi of Harlan) 

 occurred was not ascertained; but there is every probability that it was 

 taken from the same formation. 



The bones of the mammalia occurred generally in groups; and in some 

 cases a large number of those of the same skeleton were found together. 

 From this circumstance and the unworn and perfect state of many of the 

 bones, it is highly probable that the carcasses of the animals were floated, 

 or fell into the then lake or stream, and that, sinking to the sandy bottom, 

 they were gradually covered to their present depth by the deposits of the 

 sediments of the water. Of the species discovered, the remains of the 

 Megatherium and the Mammoth were.the most abundant; and of the former 

 six heads of femurs were found in the bed of the canal within the distance 

 of a mile. All the bones were at the same depth, and imbedded in the 

 same stratum; thus leaving no doubt of their co-existence at a period suc- 

 ceeding the elevation from the ocean of the newer pliocene, but antece- 

 dent to the formation of the older recent alluvium of this coast. 



The co-existence of the Megatherium with the Mastodon, Mammoth, 

 Hippopotamus, Horse, Ox, and Hog, has here, it is believed, been for the 

 first time established; and forms, with the discovery on this continent, of 

 a well defined fossil species of Sus, two interesting facts in Geology. 



The identity of most of the fossil shells which were found below the 

 bones of the mammalia with the existing species on this coast, proves 

 that the temperature of the ocean, long prior to the existence of the Me- 

 gatherium, Mammoth, and Hippopotamus, was such as is congenial to the 

 present mollusca. Another inference which may be^drawn is, that the 

 surface of the country has undergone no sudden or violent change since 

 these gigantic animals occupied its forests and morasses; but that such as 

 have occurred have been slow and gradual. 



* The following species occur most abundantly: 



Venus mercenaria, Pyrula caurica, Cardium ventricosum, Artemis con- 

 centrica, Area pexata, Area ponderosa, Lucina divaricata, Modiola late- 

 ralis, Tellina alternata, Mactra lateralis ? Oliva literata, Natica duplicata, 

 Crepidula convexa.

VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. ' 



Prof. Johnson mentioned that he had made trials to'determine the vola- 

 tile and earthy ingredients of the so-called natural coke from Virginia, of 

 which samples were exhibited at a preceding meeting of the Academy. 

 This substance presents in its exterior appearance a strong contrast with 

 all known varieties of either anthracite or bituminous coal. It is wholly 

 wanting in lustre. It has lost, if it ever possessed, all continuous slines or 

 cleats, and even the surfaces of deposition appear to be in a great degree 

 obliterated. Its texture is porous. It is in very many, if not in all speci- 

 mens, strongly charged with iron pyrites, which, by exposure to the air, 

 efflorescing into sulphate of iron, gives the appearance of friability to the 

 material, and by this means distinguishing it clearly from anthracite. 



Two samples of this combustible were tried for the purpose of ascer- 

 taining the amount of earthy matter, volatile matter, and fixed carbon. 



The first gave of 



per cent. 



Volatile matter, 11 16 



Carbon, 77.86 



Earthy matter, 10.98 



100. 



The second, which appeared to be rather more highly charged with py- 

 rites than the other, gave, by the mean of four separate incinerations, of 



100. 



The distillation of this fuel by the immediate application of a red heat, 

 produces a gas which burns with a steady clear flame, of a yellowish white 

 color, accompanied by a little smoke, which, however, nearly or quite dis- 

 appears when the access of air is free and abundant. 



The distillation produces no enlargement of volume or adhesiveness of 

 the particles of carbonaceous matter, as in certain serai- bituminous or 

 " transition" coals, such as that found on Stony Creek, iu Dauphin county, 

 Pennsylvania. 



Iu regard to the applicability of the term " natural coke" to this sub- 

 stance, Prof. J. remarked, that understanding this term as indicating a 

 change of texture from that of the bituminous coal of the same district, a 

 partial discharge of the volatile ingredients of the same coal, and as a 



32 




224 [December, 1842. 



necessary consequence, a relative augmentation of the earthy material as 

 well as of the fixed carbon, he saw no impropriety in its use, but, on tlie 

 contrary, a peculiar propriety, inasmuch as neither of the other terms in 

 general use to designate mineral fuel is applicable to this variety. He re- 

 ferred to the geological report of the State of Virginia, in which an analysis 

 of this substance is given, exhibiting its composition as follows, viz : 



Carbon, 80.30 



Volatile matter, 9.98 



Ash, 9.72

business by special resolution". 



By special permission,- the Committee, consisting of Dr. 

 Godclard, Mr. Taylor, and Prof. Eogers, to whom was 

 referred a paper by Peter A. Browne, Esq., on the subject 

 of the supposed human foot prints found near St. Louis, in 

 the Carboniferous Limestone, made a Eeport as follows : 



That they do not consider that the ingenious arguments 

 of the author can tend in the least to invalidate the reason- 

 ings of Dr. Owen in favor of the artificial nature of the 

 foot marks. The evidence furnished by the paper and 

 accompanying drawing of Dr. Owen, of which the com- 

 munication before the Committee is a criticism, appears 

 sufficient to place this question at rest for ever. 



That these impressions are not genuine imprints of the 

 human feet, but rude imitations, is obvious upon a slight 

 anatomical consideration of them. Both the form and 

 attitudes of the toes are entirely at variance with nature, 

 and are such as to suggest that the sculptor exercised but 

 a slight familiarity with the structure and capacities of 

 motion of the parts. A mere inspection will satisfy all 

 anatomists upon this point. 



The geological proofs against their having been formed 

 whilst the limestone was yet in a plastic state are no less 

 decisive, since the facts stated by Dr. Owen go distinctly 

 to show that the slab containing these foot prints is a por- 

 tion of the carboniferous limestone formation of the Mis- 

 sissippi Valley, the Oceanic origin of each layer of which 

 every geologist is prepared to demonstrate. Formed in 

 the bed of an extended sea, and buried previous to its 

 upheaval under an enormous accumulation of other 

 deposits, it is impossible to conceive how human footsteps 

 could gain access to the unconsolidated rock, even if the 

 human race had existence at the time. That the race of 

 man is of incalculably later origin than the rock containing 




226 [December, 1842. 



these representations of feet, is, however, a fact thoroughly 

 established in geology. 



Setting aside, then, the possibility of referring the origin 

 of these foot prints to the period of the formation of the 

 rock, there is quite as little warrant for assigning it to any 

 later period posterior to the upheaval and denudation of 

 the stratum, for there are no facts connected with this, or 

 any other of our ancient secondary rocks, which indicate 

 that they retained their plastic condition after they were 

 drained, to so late a date as ihe human epoch. 



Guided by these and other considerations of similar 

 purport, your Committee express their conviction, that the 

 arguments detailed in the paper submitted to them do not 

 at all weaken the published proofs of the artificial nature 

 of the supposed foot prints. 



On motion of Dr. Goddard, the communication of Mr. 

 Browne, referred to in the above report, was ordered to be 

 placed on file.

228 [December, 1842. 



MEETING FOR BUSINESS, AND ANNUAL MEETING. 



December 27, 1842. 



Yice President Morton in the Chair. 



The Annual Reports of the Librarian, of the Treasurer, 

 and of the Publication Committee havinar been read and 

 adopted, the following Report was presented on behalf of 

 the Botanical Committee and adopted, and ordered to be 

 published in the Procedings. 



The Botanical Committee having, during the present year, completed 

 the arrangement of the extensive and valuable collection of Plants, pre- 

 sented in 1839 hy Dr. F. Menke, of Pyrmont, Germany, beg leave to 

 make the following statement, forming the principal portion of their Re- 

 port, due at this season. 



The apparent neglect and delay in the arrangement of this collection on 

 the part of the Committee, may be accounted for by the fact, that at the 

 period of its presentation, preparations were in progress for the erection of 

 the new Hall, and that after the removal of the Museum to the latter, a 

 large portion of the time and attention of the Committee was required, in 

 common with the other members of the Academy, for the disposal and ar- 

 rangement of its collections in the other departments. 



During this period the plants had not been removed from the boxes in 

 which they had been originally sent by Dr. Menk<5. On examination they 

 were found to be very carefully and closely packed, and to have sustained 

 no injury from dampness, and but comparatively few specimens to have 

 been destroyed by insects. The whole collection had been arranged after 

 the Linuean or artificial system ; the plants distributed into fasciculi and 

 labelled accordingly. About two-thirds were well selected and character- 

 istic specimens, in good paper, with labels containing the name with the 

 authority for it, the synonyme, the locality, date of collection, and frequently 

 the name of a donor. The remainder were enclosed in coarse brown paper, 

 without order or arrangement, and although in most cases properly labelled ; 

 in many close comparison and study were necessary, in order to determine 

 even the generic character. The localities were chiefly Pyrmont, Bruns- 

 wick, Bremen, Arolsen, Monspelier, and Gottingen. From the celebrated 

 botanical garden in the vicinity of this latter, very many species had been 

 derived. Specimens were occasionally met with from France, the West 

 Indies, Hungary, &c. 



The greater part of this collection had been made between the years 

 1810 and 1815. 



Among the names of donors were many distinguished in Botanical 

 Science, as Thunberg, Sprengel, Bernhardi, Prof. Treviranus, Prof. 

 Mertens, Rasmer Goehnat, Lehtnann, Salzmann, Rohde, Weudland, Meyer, 

 Shrceder, Ehrtnberg, Schmidt, &c. 



By a reference to the new catalogue, it will be seen that a large propor- 

 tion of the genera (and most probably of the species) contained in this 








December, 1842.] 229 



collection were already possessed by the Academy. On this account, 

 therefore, and as the number of cultivated specimens was large, the Com- 

 mittee deemed it unadvisable to incorporate it with the Herbarium of the 

 Academy, but concluded upon keeping it entirely distinct, adopting, how- 

 ever, a similar plan of arrangement as in the Herbarium of the Academy, 

 viz., combining, as far as possible, the Linnean or Artificial with the Na- 

 tural System. 



To accomplish this duty occupied the time and attention of the Commit- 

 tee for several months. The best and most characteristic specimens were 

 selected, transferred to paper of uniform size and color, with the generic 

 name attached to the left hand upper corner of the sheet; the genera being 

 arranged in their appropriate natural orders, commencing with those latter 

 which contained the largest proportion of genera belonging to the first 

 Linnean class, and' so on proceeding to the last this being the plan of the 

 Herbarium of the Academy alluded to above. 



As thus completed, the collection comprises 1298 genera, including up- 

 wards of 7000 species. Of these, 5623 species are Phoenogamous, includ- 

 ed in about 130 natural orders; and 1272 species are Cryptogamous. Of 

 the latter, the Ferns embrace 132 species; Equisetum, LycopodiumJ and 

 the Marsileaceae, 29 species; Hepaticae 65 species; Musci 309 species; 

 Algaj 122 species; Lichenes 152 species; and Fungi 445 species. To these 

 are to be added 18 species of Corallia, and a number of plants to which 

 neither the generic nor specific name was attached. 



The whole has been distributed into thirty-6even folio volumes of large 

 size, occupying an entire case six and a half feet high, four feet wide, and 

 tweuty-one inches in depth. 



The duplicates are very numerous, and will answer for exchanges. 



The new catalogue, alluded to above, has been. found necessary, on ac- 

 count of there now being two separate collections, the previous catalogue 

 referring but to one. It is furnished with a double column of reference, so 

 that a genus contained in both collections can be very readily found. 



A number of donations, some of which are of much value, have been 

 received by the Academy during the year. These have been already 

 noticed in the published Proceedings at the time of presentation. 



The chief donors have been our fellow members A. Browne, Esq., 

 and Mr. R. C. Taylor; Dr. George Engelmann, of St. Louis, Missouri, 

 and Prof. Short, of Louisville, Kentucky. 



The duty of incorporating these donations with the Herbarium has been 

 necessarily deferred until next year. 



On behalf of the Committee, 



Wm, S. Zantzinger, 

 Robert Bridges, 

 Gavin Watson.

 paper, he has had an oppor- 

 tunity of examining a large 

 number of specimens, which 

 have enabled him to correct 

 his description in several par- 

 ticulars, viz : " The appear- 

 ance that the shield covered a 

 part of the articulations was 

 accidental ; these articula- 

 tions are six in number, and 

 uncovered by the shield, ex- 

 cepting the outer portion of 

 the anteriorcostal arches, (see 

 figure ) The tail in the most 

 perfect specimen consists also 

 of six articulations, each sub- 

 divided by an inferior joint 

 or depression, giving the ap- 

 pearance of twelve articulations. The middle lobe of the 

 tail is itself trilobate, appearing like the whole body of a 

 small trilobate entire."

MEETING FOR BUSINESS, January 31, 1S43. 



Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



After the Reports of several Committees, and that of the 

 Corresponding Secretary had been read, the following An- 

 nual Report was presented by the Recording Secretary. 



REPORT. 



In presenting his Report of the operations of the Society during the past 

 year, the Recording Secretary embraces the opportunity of congratulating 

 the members upon the present condition of the Institution, and the flatter- 

 ing prospect which it has of prosperity for the future. 



The state of its finances, as appears from the report of the Treasurer, 

 and, to use his words, " is superior to that of any period since its organi- 

 zation." This satisfactory state of things has been occasioned principally 

 by the receipt, in February last, of the sum of $6000, being the balance of 

 the second subscription of the late William Maclure. To his brother and 

 executor, Mr. Alexander Maclure, is the Society under great obligations, 

 for the persevering efforts which were made by him to accomplish this 

 object, and also for the interest which he manifested in the general wel- 

 fare of our Institution. The Academy has been thereby enabled to liqui- 

 date several urgent claims, and greatly to reduce the debt incurred in the 

 purchase of the ground on which the present building is erected. 



In addition to this, its funds have been considerably augmented during 

 the last few months by the final and successful settlement of a long pend- 

 ing suit for a claim of upwards of $5000 against the heirs of an unsettled 

 estate. This was a mortgage transferred to the Academy many years 

 since, by the late Wm. Maclure. In consequence of many difficulties and 

 vexatious delays thrown in the way of settlement of this matter, the Aca- 

 demy had hitherto been unable to make this fund in any way available. 

 By a compromise made with the heirs, fourteen per cent, of the 




23S [January, 1S43. 



whole amount has heen deducted for their use; the balance, amounting to 

 $4549, is in Pennsylvania five per cent, stock, to which is to be added 

 $430 interest, paid in par funds, and 113 in six per cent. Pennsylvania 

 stock, also as interest; the latter being redeemable by the State in August 

 next. In accordance with the desire of Mr. Alexander Maclure, the first 

 mentioned sum will not be appropriated at present by the Academy, but 

 retained until some improvement in the stock occurs, which, it is hoped, 

 will be at no distant date. At all events, the Society has the positive 

 assurance of Mr. Maclure that no loss shall be sustained, and that both 

 principal and interest shall be eventually realised. 



For the final adjustment of this affair, the Academy is under great obli- 

 gations to this gentleman, to the Counsel of the Academy, and to several 

 other members. 



The Museum of the Academy has been augmented by large and valuable 

 additions to all its departments during last year. The details of these 

 presentations, with the names of the donors, have been already given in 

 the published Proceedings of the Academy during the year, and need not, 

 therefore, be repeated here. But a brief mention of the names of those 

 who have contributed most largely in each department is considered due 

 to them, and will not be unacceptable to the Society. 



Cairo, Egypt, J. Hamilton Couper, Esq., of Georgia, Mr. Joseph Brano, of 

 Philadelphia, and minor donations by Drs. Chaloner, Watson, Carson and 

 Blanding, and by Prof. W. B. Rogers, of Virginia. 



In the Ornithological department the presentations have been large and 

 valuable, and made chiefly by 



Prof. Holbrook, of South Carolina, Mr. Charles Twigg, of New Harmony, 

 Indiana, Mr. J. W. Rulon, and also by a club of members. Also by Mr. 

 .1. G. Bell, of New York, by the President of the Society, Mr. Wm. 

 Hembel, and by Mr. George W. Carpenter, Dr. William Blanding, and 

 Mrs. William Fnrness, of this city. 



To the Cabinet of Shells important additions have been made by 

 Dr. Paul B. Goddard, Dr. Benjamin B. Brown, of St. Louis, Missouri, 

 Mr. .1. Hamilton Couper, Dr. Wm. Walker, of Nashville, Tennessee, and 

 Dr. J. C. Jay, of New York. Also by Mrs. Lucy W. Say, Mr. P. H. 

 Nicklin, Mr. Haldeman, Mr. Phillips, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cassin, &c. 



The Botanical department has been indebted for well preserved and in- 

 teresting donations of plants to 



Peter A. Browne, Esq., Mr. Richard C. Taylor, the Rev. J. P. Durbin, 

 Prof. Short, of Louisville, Kentucky, Dr. George Engleman, of St. Louis, 

 Missouri, J. Frampton Watson, Esq.; and also to Drs. Carson, Godon, 

 and others, 



A portion of the Herbarium containing the natural family Composite 

 has been carefully examined by Dr. Asa Gray, of New York, in whose 

 hands it had been placed, at his own request, for this purpose, and has 

 been considerably improved, and some additions made to it by him. 



A very large collection of plants presented in the year 1839, by Dr. 




January, 1S43.] 239 



Menke, of Pyrmont, Germany, has been at length examined and arranged 

 by the Botanical Committee, 'whoso Report states that, as arranged, it con- 

 tains not less than 7000 species in excellent condition. On account of its 

 size and value they have decided upon keeping it in a separate case from 

 those containing the Academy's Herbarium, and to designate it the " Menke 

 Collection." 



Of Minerals, the donations have been chiefly from the following mem- 

 bers and others. 



P. A. Browne, J. Randolph Clay, George R. Gliddon, Wm, S. Vaux, 

 J. A. Clay, Esqs., Dr. Wm. T. Craige, &c. 



In the Entomological department we have had but a single donation to 

 record in the past year that made by Mr. Charles Twigg, of New 

 Harmony, Indiana, of insects from that region. The Secretary, however, 

 has the satisfaction to state, that it is the determination of several 

 members to exert themselves during the coming season, personally, and 

 throuo-h friends in the United States, in making collections of American 

 Insects for the Academy. He would respectfully suggest that the aid of 

 Foreign Correspondents be also solicited for this purpose. 



To the Museum there has also been added a number of fine Quadrupeds, 

 Reptiles, Fishes, Skeletons of Animals and Crania, by members and cor- 

 respondents. 



The donations made by the different contributors mentioned, are upwards 

 of eighty in number. It would be difficult to form a just estimate of the 

 number of specimens embraced by them ; it cannot, however, fall short of 

 from four to five hundred. Taken collectively, they form a mass of great 

 value to the lover of Natural Science, and for which the Academy has 

 every reason to return its thanks to those persons who have thus testified 

 their desire to promote the interests of the Institution. 



The Library has received an equal share of consideration. Many of 

 the works presented last year are of great value, and the additions are 

 equal in number to those of former years. The entire number of volumes, 

 pamphlets, works published in parts, &c, added to the Library in 1842, 

 has been one hundred and thirty-two; and of these, according to the report 

 of the Librarian, sixty-nine are new works. For some of these the Aca- 

 demy exchanges its own publications with other Institutions and indivi- 

 duals. A large proportion of them, however, have been voluntary contri- 

 butions from authors, members, and correspondents. 



A new set of cases, occupying the whole extent of the South Flying 

 Gallery, has been recently completed, which adds much to the appearance 

 of the Hall. One-half of these cases has been appropriated to the valuable 

 collection of crania belonging to Dr. Morton, and the remainder to the ac- 

 commodation of a very extensive series of volumes containing the debates 

 and proceedings of the different legislative bodies of France during the 

 period of the Revolution. Its great size, in fact, (upwards of 1600 volumes,) 

 has hitherto prevented its introduction into the Hall, lest it should encroach 

 too much on the space in the Library allotted to works of a strictly scien- 

 tific character. As a full record of the events of that epoch of history it 

 is highly valuable, and is believed to be possessed by no other Institution 




2-40 [January, 1843. 



in this country. There are, besides, duplicates of many of these volumes, 

 which the Academy could, without doubt, exchange for scientific works, 

 or dispose of in some other way. 



The meetings of the Society have been held with great regularity during 

 the year, at the stated periods, without a single exception, and have been 

 characterised by ample evidences of zeal and interest in the cause of 

 science. Many valuable original papers have been presented, most of 

 which have been published either in the Journal of the Academy, or in 

 its Proceedings, and have contributed still further to advance the high 

 character of our Institution. 



The Second Part of the 8th Volume of the Journal was issued about the 

 middle of the year, and besides the papers referred to, contains many well 

 executed and faithful illustrations of the objects which they describe. The 

 Proceedings have been published at intervals of from one to three months. 

 This plan of publication was commenced early in the year 1841, and has 

 been adhered to ever since with advantage to the members and corres- 

 pondents affording them a medium for acquainting the scientific public 

 with their discoveries and observations without delay. 



Several prominent members have had in view for some time past the 

 reduction of the annual contribution to one-half its present amount, and 

 have only been prevented from bringing the subject before the Society, 

 for its action, from a conviction that its best interests would be consulted 

 by deferring it until something more definite and certain was known re- 

 specting the amount of reduction which would be effected in the remaining 

 debt of the Academy during the present year. An effort will then be 

 made at the earliest practicable period to accomplish this object, which, it 

 is believed, is desired by a large majority of the members. 



From the statement thus given of the operations of this Society during 

 the past year, it is hoped that the assertion made at the beginning of this 

 report, that its present condition is flattering, will not be considered as 

 having been premature or unfounded. 



With no other debt remaining, except the one just referred to and that 

 in the way of reduction at an early period, and to such an extent as, after 

 its accomplishment, to admit of the Society's appropriating annually a 

 considerable portion of its income to the scientific purposes of the Insti- 

 tution with a list of nearly one hundred and fifty contributing and resi- 

 dent members, and of three hundred and seventy domestic and foreign cor- 

 respondents, mostly zealous in aiding the Institution, and in promoting the 

 objects for which it was founded, it is not hazarding too much in express- 

 ing the belief that by a steady continuance of these efforts, and a prudent 

 management of its financial concerns, its prosperity must henceforth be 

 permanent. 



Twenty-five years only have elapsed since this Institution was incor- 

 porated. It is therefore still in its youth. In that time it has advanced 

 from comparative unimportance, to a consequence and standing which the 

 most sanguine of its founders could scarcely have anticipated. To the 

 industry, talent, zeal and liberality of many of its members, is this to be 




January, 1843.] 241 



attributed, but chiefly to the aid derived from its early friend and patron 

 the late Wm. Maclure. 



For conducting it through many difficulties during the early part of this 

 period ; for furnishing the principal portion of the means for erecting the 

 edifice in which we are now met; and for the abundant evidences of his 

 generosity in every direction around us in this Hall, do we owe him our 

 grateful acknowledgements. A distinguished member of this Society, 

 who is himself one of its warmest and most active friends, and who has 

 contributed in no small degree to its advancement, has already done ample 

 justice to the memory of Mr. Maclure for these acts.* But there still re- 

 mains with us the obligation, which is of no light character, to use every 

 suitable endeavor to place this Institution in that elevated position which, 

 in making it the special object of such munificence, it was the design of 

 Mr. Maclure it should hold. 



All which is respectfully submitted, by 



Wm. S. Zantzinger, 



Recording Secretary.

 ordinary and beautiful forms of Sulphate of Lime, or fibrous 

 Gypsum, found in the Mammoth Cave, Kentucky. 



For these, as being a peculiar variety of this mineral, he 

 suggests the new name of "Oulophyllites." 



Prof. Johnson read an extract from a letter from Prof. 

 F. W. Johnston, of Durham, England, announcing the cha- 

 racters of a new species of sugar resembling mannite in ap-

 of grape sugar, viz.: Carbon 24, Hydrogen 28, and Oxygen 

 2S; but losing by heat seven atoms of water, becoming Car- 

 bon 24, Hydrogen 24, Oxygen 24. 



This sugar drops from certain species of Eucalyptus 

 which abound in Van Dieman's Land and in New Holland. 

 It is not so sweet as grape sugar, and is not likely, therefore, 

 to meet with any extensive economical application. Theo- 

 retically, however, it is very interesting.

Professor Johnson exhibited some samples of sheathing copper from 

 the bottoms of vessels, which showed the effects of corrosion and attrition 

 after it had been in use for a very limited period, and alluded to the great 

 deterioration, of late years, in the quality of the commercial article, both 

 in this country and abroad. 




246 [February, 1843. 



As it was highly important to the interests of Commerce and of the 

 Navy that some test should be had which might be conveniently put in 

 use for ascertaining the degree of purity of sheathing copper; and as che- 

 mical tests were not always at hand, or readily applied by inexperienced 

 persons, Prof. Johnson had invented an apparatus, of simple construction 

 and easy management, called a test vice, which he exhibited and explained, 

 by means of which the degree of tenacity of portions of sheathing copper 

 could be readily ascertained. 



Strips of copper from different sources, about an inch in width, were 

 'hen subjected to the test, and their comparative value determined by the 

 number of bends which they would bear until fracture was produced. 



Prof. Johnson also exhibited two specimens of Cannel Coal, one 

 termed by him slaty Cannel, from Kentucky, and the other from Missouri, 

 called floating Cannel, from the circumstance of its floating on water' 

 which fluid it afterwards absorbs, and then sinks. Prof. Johnson also 

 gave the results of his analysis of these coals, which accorded in mos 1 

 respects with that of the Cannel Coal of Scotland, as obtained by Mr. 

 Richardson.

Professor Rogers remarked, in reference to the fossil 

 specimen presented this evening by his brother, that no 

 recent contribution to our Palseontology was more inter- 

 esting at this time than the discovery, by the latter, of this 

 familiar European species, in a particular division of the 

 New Red Sandstone of Virginia. Being an abundant and 

 characteristic shell of the Upper New Red Sandstone of 

 Europe, its occurrence in this country is regarded by Prof. 

 W. B. Rogers as affording the first decisive indication of 

 the precise date or equivalency of the extensive American 

 formation already referred by Prof. Hitchcock, by himself 

 and other Geologists, to the general Poikilitic or New Red 

 Sandstone period.

WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS. 



Mr. Phillips read a communication -addressed to the 

 Academy, from Mr. John G. Anthony, of Cincinnati, Ohio, 

 dated February 19, 1843, of which the following is a 

 portion. 



" By the published transactions of the American Philo- 

 sophical Society for 16th December last, I perceive that 

 Mr. Lea has described twelve species of Melania from 

 Alabama and Tennessee. One of these, under the name 

 of ' M. excisa,' he proposes to erect into a new genus, under 

 the name of 'Schizostoma,' on account of the deep slit in 

 the lip. Having possessed specimens from the same 

 localities for some time past, embracing, as I believe, seven 

 or eight species of this proposed genus, I have referred 

 them to Swainson's genus, 'Melatoma,' founded, as he 

 states, ' upon a Shell sent him many years ago by his old 

 friend Professor Eafinesque, and which, he says, has the 

 general form of Pleurotoma melafusus, with a well 

 defined sinus or cleft near the top of the outer lip.' I have 

 mentioned this with a view to call the attention of the 

 members to it, and to have the question of nomenclature 

 settled correctly. I have, within two months past, received 

 one species of this genus from Dr. Mighels, of Portland, 

 Maine, under the name of 'Apella scissura.' " 



The communication was accompanied by a second and 

 corrected edition of his Catalogue of the Terrestrial and 

 Fluviatile Shells of Ohio. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper intended for publication, and 

 entitled "A Description of several new and rare Birds from 

 the Kocky Mountains and California, by William Gambel:"

Dr. Cogswell, Secretary and Librarian of the Northern 

 Academy of Arts and Sciences at Hanover, New Hamp- 

 shire, then briefly addressed the Society in reference to the 

 origin and design of that Institution, and on its behalf 

 solicited several volumes of the Journal of the Academy, 

 which it was desirous of possessing in order to complete 

 its series of the same. 



The Chairman announced that Mr. John James Audubon 

 and Mr. Edward Harris, accompanied by an artist, left this 

 city yesterday morning on their route to St. Louis, and 

 thence to the sources of the Yellow Stone Eiver and the 

 Eocky Mountains. The object of this expedition is the 

 discovery of new species of Birds and Quadrupeds for the 

 works of Mr. Audubon, and especially for his Mammalogy 

 of North America, now in course of publication. The 

 expedition is expected to return in October, and promises 

 important additions to every department of natural science. 



The Chairman also called the attention of the Society 

 to the first number of Mr. Audubon's "Quadrupeds," which 

 is placed in the Hall for inspection, and for the subscription 

 of such members and others as may desire to possess this 

 truly splendid and invaluable work.

VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Prof. Henry D. Rogers drew the attention of the Society to 

 the stratigraphical features of the environs of St. Petersburg, as 

 represented in the maps and sections appended to the volume of 

 "Publications of the Imperial Russian Society," just laid upon 

 the table. He pointed out, in particular, the perfect identity in 

 the form of the Russian anticlinal flexures and those of the 

 Appalachian chain of the 'United States; the resemblance con- 

 sisting in the want of a symmetrical curvature in the arches, and 

 an inequality in the steepness of the dips on the opposite sides 

 of the axes. 



Alluding to the structural laws first developed by his brother 

 and himself from a study of the Appalachian chain, and conceived 

 by them to characterize regions of anticlinal axes generally, he 

 proceeded to show that upon the theory of the origin of these 

 flexures, the same style of curvature should be met with in all 

 countries, as a necessary consequence of the universality of those 

 laws. The exhibition, therefore, of an anticlinal arch, having 

 the normal form, in the banks of the Pulkowka in Russia, goes 

 to conGrm the generalizations of these authors. Instances of the 

 same characteristic feature are to met with abundantly, however, 

 in the sections which geologists present of the stratification in 

 many other districts of Europe.

Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



The Monthly Report of the Corresponding Secretary was 

 read and adopted. / 



The Committee, consisting of Prof. Johnson, Mr. Halde- 

 man, and Mr. Peale, to whom was referred, in November, 

 1842, a communication from Peter A. Browne, Esq., accom- 

 panying some specimens of an earthy matter from Lancaster 

 county, Pennsylvania, supposed to be identical with Terra 

 di Sienna, made a report, which was adopted. The report 

 stated that after a careful investigation of the subject, and 

 comparisons in several modes with the genuine article, the 

 Committee had formed the following conclusions: 



"That the earth in question is a hydrated silicate of Alu- 

 mina tinged with variable proportions of peroxide of iron; 

 8.17 grs. of one of the best samples having been calcined at 

 redness for twenty minutes in a platinum capsule, left 6.74 

 grs. of dark brown fragments, showing a loss of 17.5 per 

 cent, of water" "and that for certain minor purposes in 

 the arts, this coloring matter may be highly useful, but as 

 a general substitute for Terra di Sienna, it cannot be 

 expected to gain the approbation of artists." 



The Committee, consisting of Mr. Cassin, Mr. Haldeman, 

 and Mr. Phillips, to whom was referred Mr. William 

 Gambel's* paper, entitled " Descriptions of some new and 

 rave Birds of the Rocky Mountains and California," reported 

 in favor of its publication, with the exception of the generic 

 and specific characters of the Eudromus variegatus of that 

 paper, which they deem it expedient .to defer until the 

 receipt of the specimen. 



* This gentleman has just completed the tour of the Rocky Mountains 

 aud California, at the instance of Mr. Kuttall, to whom this paper was 

 originally addressed, and by him referred to the Academy for Publication. 




April, 1843.1 259 



Picus* Nuttalii. 



Male, varied with black and white ; back transversely banded with 

 black and white; upper part of the head black with linear white spots ; 

 hind head with a broad red stripe ; sides of the head and neck black, 

 with a wide stripe running from the base of the bill about the length 

 of the head, also white stripes running from the eyes and uniting on 

 the back of the neck, which is black. Rump and two middle tail- 

 feathers black. Wing-feathers on their outer and inner webs, with 

 six or seven bands of white spots ; all the wing coverts also with white 

 spots ; tips of some of the tertiaries light brown. Beneath white, with 

 a slight tinge of yellow ; sides and vent with dark brown spots ; lower 

 tail coverts and tail-feathers, except the two middle ones, white, 

 with irregular bands or spots of dark brown ; throat and breast 

 white ; second quill shorter than the seventh ; third, fourth, and fifth 

 nearly equal. Two white tufts of hair-like feathers at the base of the 

 upper mandible. Irides red. Length seven inches. 



This pretty species I shot in a willow thicket near the Pueblo de 

 los Angelos, Upper California, December 10th. It was actively en- 

 gaged pecking into one of the trees ; from time to time uttering a 

 singular note, unlike any I have heard from a woodpecker. It is, 

 perhaps, a common species in the summer time. 



Parus* montanus. 



Male. Head, upper part of the back, throat, and upper part of the 

 breast pure black; two white stripes commence on the front and extend 

 over the head about the length of it, leaving a black band in the centre 

 and a stripe running over each eye to the nape ; cheeks and shoulders 

 white. Wings and tail brownish 'gray; beneath whitish ; tinged with 

 brown on the sides and vent. Legs bluish. Length a little over five 

 inches. Tail two and a half inches. 



This new and distinct species we first observed about a-day's jour- 

 ney from Santa Fe, in New Mexico, and from thence in all the 

 ranges of the Rocky Mountains nearly to California. Its manners and 

 notes are very much like those of the common Chickadee, but the lat- 

 ter are more weak and varied. It keeps also much in low bushes, 

 where from morning to night, with untiring patience and activity, it 

 may be seen hopping from bush to bush, searching them minutely 

 for small insects. It also frequently descends to the ground to pick 

 up small seeds ; when thus occupied it occasionally stops, looks around 

 and utters a slender te de de de, then altering to de de dait, flies off 

 to some other bush. On the Rio Colorado it keeps much in the cot- 

 ton wood trees which grow along its banks, and its notes, which be- 

 came familiar, were almost the only ones heard in the winter, when 




260 [April, 1843. 



we were there, to cheer our course. This species is sometimes seen 

 in company with the P. minutus, Town., and Regulus calendula, 

 which at this time are roving in large and busy flocks along the 

 small streams. It is probably found also in the mountains of California. 



Fringilla Blandingiana.\ 



Male. Above olive green tinged with cinereous and brown. Crown 

 i - ufous red ; front, line over the eye, ears, and breast cinereous ; throat 

 pure white ; a white line also running from the base of the lower 

 mandible to the neck, below wliich is a line of blackish tipped with 

 cinereous. Sides brownish ; belly and veDt white ; wings and tail 

 brown ; wing coverts, margins of the primaries and secondaries and 

 tail feathers, especially near the base, bright yellowish green ; tail be- 

 neath pale green. Length six and a quarter inches. Feet and legs 

 stout, brown ; tarsus and middle toe, with the nail, seven-eighths of an 

 inch in length ; hind toe nail longer than the toe ; bill above dark 

 brown, beneath paler. 



Of this new and singujarly marked species I procured a single 

 specimen only, in September, on the bank of a small stream in the 

 Eocky Mountains, about half way between New Mexico and the Col- 

 orado of the west. It kept in low bushes in company with the F. 

 guttata, Nutt., and F. graminea, occasionally uttering a single chip. 

 The throat and breast of this species very much resemble those of the 

 F. Pennsylvanica. 



Lophortyx* Gambelii, Nutt. 



Cinereous-brown above ; head bright rufous ; crest of six black 

 feathers one and three-fourths inches long, wide at the tips and curv- 

 ing forwards ; throat black, banded by a line of white ; front of long 

 grayish and black bristly feathers, with a baud of white across them 

 near their tips, which extends over the eye to the back of the head; 

 feathers of the neck and upper part of the back small, cinereous, each 

 with a central streak of dark rufous; upper part of the breast and 

 shoulders cinereous; lower part of the breast cream colored; middle 

 of the belly black; flanks dark rufous ; each feather with a large lan- 

 ceolate central spot of pure white ; tertiaries edged on their upper 

 margins with yellowish white; tail rounded, cinereous blue; under 

 coverts with dark brown spots. Length a little over ten inches. 

 Wings four and a half; fourth quill longest: second and seventh 

 equal. Bill black. Feet and legs dull bluish. Tarsus one and a 

 quarter inches. Tail four and a half. 



We met with small flocks of this handsome species some distance 

 west of California, in the month of November, inhabiting the most 



-j- In honour of Wm. Blanding, M.D., of Philadelphia. 




April, 1843.] 261 



barren brushy plains, covered with a species of Chenopodium. Here, 

 where a person would suppose it to be impossible for any animal to 

 subsist, they were seen running about in small flocks of five or six, 

 occasionally uttering a low guttural call of recognition, sometimes of 

 several notes, very different from that of the common species. When 

 flying they utter a loud sharp whistle, and conspicuously display the 

 long crest. 



Lanius elegans. White winged Shrike, Swains. 



This species, of which but a single specimen is knowntto Ornitholo- 

 gists, I found abundant in California, in the brushy plains, and some- 

 times in the hedges near the towns; it flies close to and frequently 

 alights on the ground and on low weeds ; when flying, its white 

 banded wings can be seen very distinctly; in the adults the breast 

 is pure white ; in the young blended with dark brown, like our 

 common species, except the throat and vent, which are white; some- 

 times, when disturbed, it has a harsh crying note like a jay, pay pay 

 pay. 



Sciurus tenuirostris? Swains. Synopsis Birds of Mexico? 



Above olive brown ; beneath tawny yellow ; sides of the throat, 

 with the breast and sides, marked with irregular streaks and spots of 

 dark brown; a yellowish white line over the eye; throat, belly, and 

 vent without spots. AVings and tail blackish brown, the feathers 

 margined with yellowish white; two outer tail-feathers almost wholly 

 white ; the second merely tipped with the same. Length six inches ; 

 tarsus seven-eighths of an inch; hind toe nail as long as the toe. Bill 

 slender ; half an inch in length. 



We met with this species only on the Rio Colorado ; at that time 

 (October) keeping in small flocks along the bank of the river, some- 

 times wading in the water to pick up whatever they might find in 

 the mud, with which their bills were covered. When sitting they 

 jerked their tails in the manner of the S. Noveboracensis, which they 

 somewhat resemble ; they also uttered, when flying, a few slender 

 notes. 



Swainson questions the S. tenuirostris being found on the table land. 

 This species, I should think, was not, from its habits, although I saw 

 a few specimens among some sage bushes (Artemisia) near the river. 



Ptilogonys Townsendii, And., Xutt. 



This rare and singular bird, of which but a single specimen has 

 been obtained in Oregon, I first met with, in .October, on the banks of 

 a small, rocky creek, in the Rocky mountains, between the Rio Colo- 

 rado and California. Here, in the depth of solitude, it was flying 

 along the stream, alighting on the rocks, and jerking its tail in a lively 




262 [April, 1843. 



manner, feeding solely on buffalo berries (Shepherdia) which grew 

 plentifully along its banks, and with which its stomach was crammed. 

 We afterwards found it on one of the highest and most desolate moun- 

 tains, near a small pool of water, to which, towards evening, various 

 kinds of birds came to drink, and amoung them two individuals of this 

 species, which I killed ; ' but these, like the specimen procured by 

 Mr. Townsend, were females, as are all the specimens I have obtained. 

 It appeared to have somewhat the manner of a fly-catcher, and I never 

 heard it uttera note. 



Turdus nanus, Aud., Nutt. 



This small and, I think, perfectly distinct species, we saw frequently 

 in the Rocky mountains, frequenting low solitary places, and keeping 

 much on the ground. In California, and also near the Pueblo de los 

 Angelos, in January, I have seen several specimens in the willow 

 hedges and brushy places in company with the sparrows. Though it 

 resembles, in general appearance, the T. solitarius, it may easily be 

 distinguished by its smaller size, never exceeding six inches in 

 length. 



Fringilla Gambelii, Nutt., Man. of Ornith. 



This species, procured in Oregon by my friend Mr. Townsend, was 

 very common on the road from near New Mexico to California, where 

 it is also seen in almost every hedge in company with F. leucophrys, 

 to which it is closely allied, if not the same species. 



ERYTHRospizA/rcwtaZi's, Bonap. 



In California this species is extremely abundant at the time we were 

 there (January), keeping in small flocks in the neighborhood of the 

 towns, and frequently in the gardens in company with various species 

 of sparrows. It has much the habit of E. purpurea, but is more fami- 

 liar. In Santa Fe, in New Mexico, it builds its nest under the portals 

 of the houses in the public square, and alights familiarly about the 

 doors ; in July they had fledged young. They also appeared here to 

 have a partiality for meat, which is frequently hung up in the sheds, 

 eating it greedily whenever they had an opportunity. In California, 

 also, I have observed them examining the sheds and portals, perhaps 

 for places suitable for building their nests. 



DEFERRED BUSINESS. 



The Society then proceeded to the consideration of two 

 Eesolutions offered at previous meetings, to alter Article I., 

 Chapter III., of the By-Laws, reducing the amount of the

initiation fee from $10 to $5; and Article 3d of same Chap- 

 ter, reducing the amount required to constitute a Life Mem- 

 bership from 80 to $50 both of which were adopted. 



NEW BUSINESS. 



Dr. Morton stated that he had deposited in the Academy 

 a large number of valuable letters and papers which had 

 been placed in his hands by General Parker, Administrator 

 to the Estate of the late Zaccheus Collins, embracing the 

 Botanical Correspondence of the latter with Muhlenberg, 

 Baldwin, Elliott, Bigelow, Schweinitz, Nuttall, and other 

 American Naturalists; whereupon a resolution was adopted 

 instructing the Botanical Committee to collate and arrange 

 these manuscripts and have them bound and placed in the 

 Library of the Academy.

VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Mr. Haldeman exhibited a number of relics taken from 

 the grave of an Indian, among which were some portions of 

 human bone, and several small metallic cones enclosing hu- 

 man hair. All which were in contact with the metal, or in its 

 immediate vicinity, were in a high state of preservation. 

 Mr. Haldeman inquired whether this preservation might not 

 be accounted for on the principle of galvanic action. 



Dr. Bridges believed that the presence of the copper was 

 alone sufficient to account for it ; the bone particularly would 

 be found, on close inspection, to be hardest and best pre- 

 served in those parts of it most deeply coloured by the 

 copper,

 Presented by Dr. D. D."~Owen, of New Harmony. 



VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Dr. Owen accompanied his presentation with the following 

 remarks, explanatory of the geological position of these fossi^ 

 trees : 



They were discovered twelve miles from New Harmony, 

 in excavating in a slaty clay in the bank of Big Creek, a tri- 

 butary of the Wabash, about fifteen feet below the surface, 

 and about the same distance above the bed of the stream. 

 Since the first commencement of operations there have been 

 found, as nearly as can be ascertained, from twenty to 

 twenty-five stumps, though the whole superficial area of the 

 excavation is only about 3000 feet. They were all standing 

 erect, and nearly on the same general level. Dr. 0. had him- 

 self excavated three ; the largest of these was about three 




May, 1843.] 271 



feet in height and sixteen inches in diameter. All of them 

 were provided with well preserved roots, ramifying in the 

 substance of the surrounding argillaceous deposite. 



About one foot above the fossil trees is a layer of sand- 

 stone, and a partially disintegrated seam of coal a few inches 

 thick; fifteen feet below, and beneath the water in Big 

 Creek, is a seam of coal supposed to be from three to four 

 feet thick. Nodules of argillaceous iron ore are dissemi- 

 nated in the surrounding slaty clay. No appearance of a 

 dirt bed was discovered. 



The horizontal section of these trees exhibits no medullary 

 rays nor annual growths ; but the structure of the bark is 

 visible on the external part of most of the specimens, and 

 part of it is generally converted into a dark carbonaceous 

 substance. The scars, left from the falling off of the leaf- 

 stalks, though small, are distinctly visible in some of the 

 smaller specimens. From the diameter of these scars being 

 longer horizontally than vertically, and the absence of pa- 

 rallel flutings, these monocotyledonous fossil trees are consi- 

 dered as belonging to the family of palms. 



With the exception of the fossil palm trees, found at Dixon 

 fold, on the Bury and Bolton Railroad, in England, this ap- 

 pears to be the only authentic instance of the occurrence of 

 well preserved specimens of fossil palm trees in strata of the 

 arboniferous epoch.

 mostly on a magnified scale. Dr. Owen entered into a de- 

 tailed explanation of these drawings, and pointed out the 

 fossils peculiar to each of the formations. 



Professor Rogers followed with some general observations 

 on the geology of the Western States, and also called atten- 

 tion to the remarkable character of the anticlinal axis repre- 

 sented in one of the charts exhibited this evening, which

VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Dr. Mortem, (upon resigning the chair to Dr. Goddard,) commu- 

 nicated some interesting information respecting the Cicada septem- 

 decim, or seventeen year locust, which, during a recent journey 

 from Rahway to Haddonfield, in the State of New Jersey, he had 

 observed in very great numbers. They made their appearance 

 there three or four weeks since, and were chiefly to be found in the 

 tract of country lying between the two places mentioned, not ex- 

 ceeding fifty miles in extent. In one apple orchard the trees were 

 literally loaded with them ; some trees Dr. M. supposed to contain 

 not less than two thousand. The foliage or other vegetation, so far 

 as his observatien extended, had as yet sustained no perceptible 

 injury from them ; and naturalists were still undecided with re- 




June, 1843.] 277 



gard to the kind or source of sustenance preferred by the insect 

 during the time it remains above the surface. 



Dr. Morton referred to the minutes of a former year, 1834, 

 when this insect had appeared in the city and its vicinity, for a re- 

 cord of interesting information on the subject, which, at his request, 

 was read by the Secretary. 



[The following extracts from the minutes alluded to have not 

 been published at any previous period, and are presented at this 

 time, chiefly with the view of calling the attention of members and 

 others to the subject, and of inducing farther investigation. 



At the meeting of June 3d, 1834, Dr. Harlan stated that on the 

 25th of May last he had observed the Cicada septemdecim in such 

 large numbers as to blacken a field of wheat in the vicinity of the 

 city : they were also very numerous in some of the public squares- 

 It was his belief that the insect increased somewhat in size while 

 it remained ; and also, that nothing was known respecting its food. 

 Upon dissection, mere rudiments of the organs of digestion were 

 found. 



Mr. Rogers, on the contrary, stated that in 1817, the trees in 

 the neighborhood of Baltimore had been stripped of their leaves by 

 this insect. He also expressed some doubt as to their common 

 origin, from the fact of their periodical return not being necessarily 

 in the same year in different parts of the country, and that this was 

 probably owing to geological causes. 



Dr. Keagy had seen them in 1815 in the Valley of the Missis- 

 sippi ; in 1817 near Baltimore, and in 1832 in Westmoreland 

 county, Pennsylvania ; Dr. R. Coates in 1818, in Burlington 

 county, New Jersey; Mr. Gibbons in 1825, near Moorestown, 

 New Jersey, and in 1827 in the eastern part of Virginia ; Mr. 

 Johnson in 1831, near Rochester, New York; and Dr. Morton in 

 1817, in Westchester county, New York. 



Dr. Coates had seen a tree in Germantown nearly destroyed, in 

 1817, by the deposition of the ova of the insect. 

 Dr. Pickering stated that this Cicada had not yet been met with 

 in the eastern part of New England, but that a rare species of 

 Cicada had been found nearly resembling the C. septemdecim, and 

 which might be easily confounded with it; the latter differed, how- 

 ever, in the abdomen being all black: in the former, the rings of 




278 [June, 1843. 



the abdomen have each a red border; they were usually found in 

 rocky soil. 



At the subsequent meeting, Mr. Gibbons read an extract of a 

 letter from his brother on the subject of the Cicada septemdecim, in 

 which the writer stated that he had seen them feeding on the sweet 

 gum, by pushing the proboscis into the bark ; when this organ was 

 withdrawn a drop of fluid appeared at the aperture, which served 

 for food to some ants. 



Dr. Mutter exhibited a dissection of the singing apparatus of the 

 Cicada septemdecim, consisting of the diaphragm and an air cell 

 and sounding board on each side, and a pair of muscles. The 

 whole is distinct from the abdominal cavity. The proboscis was 

 hollow, and intestines convoluted, without perceptible oesophagus or 

 stomach. 



Mr. Lukens mentioned that with Mr. T. B. Peale he had seen 

 the Cicada septemdecim feeding, by pushing the proboscis into the 

 bark of trees, particularly young beech trees. 



At the meeting on the 1st July, Dr. McEuen (then Eecording 

 Secretary) stated that the C. septemdecim had disappeared from 

 some places in the vicinity of the city since the occurrence of a 

 heavy rain ; he also exhibited the young branches of trees in which 

 the ova of the insect had been deposited in punctures in longitu- 

 dinal lines, many in one perforation. The young branches had 

 been thereby for the most part destroyed. 



Dr. Buschenberger, at the meeting of July 8th, observed that in 

 travelling from Baltimore to Frederick, Maryland, he had found 

 the C septemdecim abundant at the two places mentioned, whilst 

 none were seen in Montgomery county, between Baltimore and 

 Washington.] 



After the above extracts had been read, Prof. Bogers made some 

 remarks on the subject, chiefly confirmatory of the opinion ex- 

 pressed by him in 1834, of the periodical return of the insect being 

 influenced by geological causes. 



Dr. Goddard referred to the well known fact of the C. septem- 

 decim being occasionally found in a living state at a great distance 

 below the surface. When so discovered, its head is usually down- 

 ward. According to the published statements of a recent observer, 

 Mr. Ehrenberg, of Berlin, minute infusoria may be found at a great 




June, 1843.] 279 



depth in the earth, and authorizing the conjecture that Dr. G-. 

 offered, that these infusoria afforded sustenance to the insect during 

 its long absence. He expressed his belief that no satisfactory rea- 

 son had as yet been given for its reappearance at regular periods. 



As another fact, not probably known to the members generally, 

 he mentioned that the yolk of eggs brought from the district of 

 New Jersey at present visited by the insect, had lost, in a great 

 measure, their yellow color. This had been observed in former 

 years, and was supposed by the farmers to be caused by the fowls 

 feeding on the insect. 



Mr. Gliddon stated that in Lycoming county, in this State, 

 whence he had recently returned, the insect had been very nume. 

 rous, but at the time of his visit had nearly disappeared. The sto. 

 machs of some trout which he had caught there were found to be 

 gorged with it. 



Mr. Cassin had been informed that the C. septemclecim was now 

 very abundant in other counties of the State, particularly near 

 Mauch Chunk. He also stated that the irregularity in the time of 

 the appearance of the insect had been supposed to be owing to the 

 overlapping of adjoining districts ; as an example of which Loudon 

 <;ounty, Virginia, was mentioned, where it appears at intervals of 

 eight and nine years alternately. Although, as regards this lo- 

 cality, and perhaps some others, this hypothesis may be correct, it 

 will not apply to all cases. In 1834, the C. septemdecim appeared 

 in the neighborhood of Philadelphia and in the adjoining counties, 

 and again in small quantities in Chester county, in 1836. 



Mr. Cassin expressed the opinion that there are two varieties, of 

 the C. septemdecin, the larger and smaller, both of which appeared 

 in this vicinity in 1834 ; they differ in size, and also in their note. 

 The larger is the one commonly known as the seventeen year 

 locust. 



Dr. Goddard then called the attention of the members to a plan 

 which he had recently adopted for removing a disease, common 

 and very fatal to newly fledged chicks, and familiarly known as 

 " the gapes," and which he considered of importance to be known 

 by agriculturalists. 



Upon opening ihe trachea of a chick laboring under the disease, 

 he discovered there a parasitic worm, which obstructed respiration, 




280 [June, 1843. 



and occasioned inflammation of the part. By injecting into the 

 trachea a small quantity of a mixture of equal parts of spirit of tur- 

 pentine and olive oil, he succeeded in destroying the worm, and 

 removing all the symptoms, and in every instance saving the life 

 of the chick.

July, 1S43, 283 



MEETING FOR BUSINESS, July 25, 1843. 



Vice President Morton in the Chair. 



The Report of the Corresponding Secretary was read and 

 adopted. 



The Committee to whom was referred the following paper, 

 reported in favor of its publication in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy. 



Descriptions of two Species, supposed to be new, of the Genus Tyrannula 

 Swainson, found in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. By William M. 

 & Spencer F. Baird, of Carlisle, Pa. 



For the first of the species hereafter described, we propose the name of 

 Tyrannula flaviventris, the bright yellow colour of the lower parts constitut- 

 ing a striking feature. The other we have named Tyrannula minima, it 

 being the least of all our North American Tyrannulse. 



The similarity in colour and size between a number of our small tyrant 

 fly-catchers being very great, we have deemed it best to send with the 

 specimens of the two described, skins of T. acadica, and S. Traillii, spe- 

 cies which most nearly resemble them. By a comparison of the four, the 

 distinctive features of each will at once be perceived. 



Tyrannula flaviventris, (nob.) 

 Specific Characters. Above deep greenish olive, beneath bright sulphur 

 yellow, sides and fore part of breast olivaceous. Tail emarginate. Third 

 and fourth primaries longest. Bill brownish yellow beneath. 



Description of a Male. 



Form, $rc. Body rather stout. Bill broad and the sides convex. Tarsus 

 longer than the middle toe. Wings rounded ; third primary longest, fourth 

 slightly shorter, second one line shorter than third, and two lines longer 

 than fifth, first shorter than fifth, but longer than sixth. Tail emarginate 

 and slightly rounded. 



Colour. Bill above dark blackish brown, beneath light yellowish brown: 

 Feet brownish black. Plumage of the upper parts deep greenish olive, 

 crown of the head rather darker, the feathers having their centres dark 

 brown. A narrow ring round the eye pale yellow. Lower tail coverts, 

 abdomen, and linings of the wings, bright sulphur yellow, deepest on the 




2S4 [July, 184 3 



abdomen. Sides of the body, forepart of the breast, and sides of the neck, 

 olive, lighter than the back, and inclining to yellowish on the throat. Pri- 

 maries and tail feathers dark brown, the former bordered with grayish, 

 and the latter with olive like the back. The lower row of lesser wing co- 

 verts and the secondary coverts darker, tipped with pale yellow, that co- 

 lour forming two bands across the wing. Secondaries darker than the 

 primaries, and edged with pale yellow. 



Length 5 inches 4 lines ; extent 8 inches 8 lines ; folded wing 2 inches 

 9 lines. 



The sexes are similar in colour, but the female is generally rather 

 smaller. 



Observations. This strongly marked species will at once be distinguished 

 from every other by the deep yellow of its under parts. It resembles 

 T. acadica of Gmelin (querula of Wilson) somewhat in form, but acadica 

 by comparison will be found to be a larger bird, lighter olive above, and 

 very pale yellow beneath. The tail of acadica is even or slightly rounded, 

 in this species emarginate. 



We have no specimen of T. pusilla, of Swainson, but upon comparison 

 with the description in Swainson and Richardson's Zoology of North 

 America, (so favourably known for accuracy,) it appears to differ in the 

 colour of the upper parts, pusilla being " intermediate between hair brown 

 and oil green ;" our species is of a decided olive green ; the front of pusilla 

 is "hoary;" in our species dark brownish olive; the bands on the wing- 

 grayish white; in our species pale yellow; "throat and breast" of T. pu- 

 silla " pale ash gray;" in this species the throat is yellow, and the breast 

 olive tinged with yellow. 



This species was first observed in the spring of 1840, near Carlisle, 

 Pennsylvania. During every succeeding spring since, it has been seen in 

 greater or less numbers, and several specimens procured each year. Its 

 habits are much like those of the other species of this genus; it frequents 

 low thickets near small streams, is seldom found in large woods like T. 

 acadica, or T. virens, and is a very unsuspicious bird, allowing persons 

 to approach within a short distance, [t probably goes further north than 

 Pennsylvania to breed, having never been observed after the latter part of 

 May or beginning of June. 



Tyrannula minima, (nob. ) 

 Specific characters. Above dark grayish olive, breast light ash gray, ab- 

 domen and lower tail coverts yellowish white. Tail emarginate. Second 

 and third primaries longest, first longer than sixth. Bill horn colour be- 

 neath. 



Description of a Male. 

 Form, &c. Body rather slender. Bill smaller than the other species of 

 the genus. Tarsus slightly longer than the middle toe. Second primary 




July, 1S43. 1 285 



longest, third nearly equal, and rather longer than fourth, fifth one line 

 shorter than fourth, first intermediate between fifth and sixth. Tail emar- 

 ginate and slightly rounded. 



Colour, Bill dark blackish brown above, pale horn color beneath. Feet 

 black. Plumage of the upper parts dark grayish olive, crown somewhat 

 darker, rump lighter and inclining to grayish. A narrow ring round the 

 eye grayish white. Fore part of breast, sides, and sides of the neck light 

 ash grey, middle of throat white, rest of the lower parts very pale yellow 

 or yellowish white. Primaries and tail feathers wood brown, the former 

 narrowly, and the latter broadly edged with olive. Lower row of lesser 

 wing coverts and the secondary coverts darker, tipped with dirty white, 

 that colour forming two bands across the wings. Secondaries also dark, 

 like the greater wing coverts, and broadly edged with yellowish white. 



Length 5 inches, 2 lines. Extent 8 inches, 3 lines. Folded wing 2| 

 inches. 



No perceptible difference as to colour or size between the sexes. 



Observations. This species will be recognized by its size, its slender 

 form making it the smallest of our North American Tyrannulaa. In colour 

 it most resembles T. Traillii, of Aud., but it is a much smaller bird, being 

 nearly three-fourths of an inch shorter. T. Traillii has the breast and 

 sides of the neck olivaceous ; in this species light ash gray; the tail also of 

 T. Traillii is even. 



It differs from T. pusilla (comparing with the description of Swainson 

 and Richardson as before) in having the wings more pointed, the second 

 and third primaries being longest, and the firstlonger than the sixth; while in 

 pusilla the third and fourth are longest, and the first shorter than the sixth. 

 The upper tail coverts of pusilla are uniform in colour with the back ; in 

 our species lighter : pusilla has the front " hoary;" in this species dark. 

 The lower parts of pusilla are pale sulphur yellow, "approaching to siskin- 

 green ;" in our species yellowish white : the under mandible of pusilla is 

 yellowish brown; of this species horn colour. From the figure in the 

 Fauna Boreali-Americana, pusilla appears to be a stouter bird, much 

 deeper in colour beneath and having a broader bill. Its smaller size, and 

 darker colour above, will distinguish it from T. acadica (being two-thirds 

 of an inch shorter.) which species has also longer and more pointed wings, 

 a much larger bill which is light brown beneath, and an even tail. 



This species was first observed and procured in May, 1839, near Car- 

 lisle, Pennsylvania. Since then numbers have been observed and shot on 

 every succeeding spring. Like the preceding, (T. flaviventris,) this bird 

 does not frequent deep forests, but is found among the scattering trees 

 which border our streams. It is rather shyer than T. flaviventris, and 

 and does not, like that species, seek dense thickets. It also, most proba- 

 bly, goes further north to breed, as after the last of May it is no longer to 

 be seen. It visits us from the south in the latter part of April, generally 

 making its appearance about a week before T. flaviventris. 




2S6 [July, 1843. 



NEW BUSINESS. 



Mr. George R. Gliddon informed the Academy that he had 

 recently received a letter from his father, John Gliddon, Esq. 

 U. S. Consul in Egypt, dated Cairo, 18th June, 1S43, ex- 

 pressing regret that the Egyptian Society had been unavoid- 

 ably obliged to delay the answers to the geological queries 

 addressed to them by a Committee of the Academy. These 

 queries had been submitted to a special committee of scientific 

 members, by whom it was discovered that they had been 

 met (though under different arrangement) in a dissertation 

 which Dr. Figari (a distinguished Italian naturalist, &c. and 

 member of the Society) is preparing to be read and presented 

 at the next general meeting of the Society, expected to take 

 place on the 1st of July, and which would be published 

 forthwith. Copies would be sent to the Academy with an 

 official communication. Mr. Gliddon also stated that a copy 

 of M. Linant's (chief engineer in the Pasha's service) Me- 

 moir on Lake Maris, just published by the Egyptian Society, 

 had been sent to the Academy, and would be presented as 

 soon as received.

Descriptions of North American species of Coleoptera, presumed to be undescribed. 



By S. S. Haldeman. 



From the difficulty attendant upon the study of insects in the United States, 

 arising from the absence of standard collections, and the impossibility of know- 

 ing what has been done in Europe, the characters here given should, perhaps, 

 be regarded as indicating species unknown to the author, rather than as abso- 

 lutely new to science.

Descriptions of a New Genus, and of twenty-nine new 3Eocene, and one 

 Eocene Fossil Shells of the United States. 

 By T. A. Conrad. 



Carditamera. 



C. carinata. Trapezoidal, slightly contracted from beak to base ; ribs about 

 18, profound, flattened on the back, square, carinated on the posterior margin ; 

 posterior ribs rounded and the carina obscure or wanting; middle and anterior 

 ribs about as wide as the interstices ; all the costse with transverse coarse pro- 

 found wrinkled lines. 



Locality. Newbern, N. C. 



Compared with C. arata, this species differs, in being less ventricose over the 

 umbonial slope, in having a carina on the ribs, more distant transverse strise, the 

 beaks further from the anterior margin, and the posterior side narrower, with a 

 more oblique posterior margin. 



C. protracta. Trapezoidal, elongated, compressed, widely contracted from 

 beak to base ; dorsal and basal margins nearly parallel ; ribs about 15, the middle 

 ones triangular and crenated ; posterior ribs rounded and having distant arched 

 squamose coarse strise ; summit of the beaks scarcely prominent above the 

 hinge line. 



Locality. Patuxent River, St. Mary's Co., Md. 



Arca. 



A. triquetra. Subtriangular, profoundly ventricose ; umbo very broad and 

 prominent, beaks remote, profoundly incurved ; disk flattened posteriorly ; ribs 

 about 30, narrow, not very prominent, square; surface of the valves with coarse 

 crowded concentric imbricated lines; umbonial slope forming a right angle 

 with the posterior slope ; cardinal area dilated ; cardinal plate narrow, the teeth 

 small. 



Locality. Cliffs of Calvert, Maryland. 



This species differs from A. callipleura in having narrower ribs which are neither 

 crenated nor longitudinally striated as in that species. The A. callipleura is not 

 flattened posteriorly on the disk, and the umbonial slope is slightly arched in 

 the middle, while in the triquetra it is somewhat concave. 



Nucuia. 



N. liciata. Ovate-acute, ventricose, with about 15 concentric lamelliform 

 strise ; posterior side much shorter than the anterior ; anterior side slightly re- 

 curved, with an oblique slight submarginal furrow, causing a slight emargination 

 of the base near the extremity. 



Locality. Cliffs of Calvert, Md. 




306 [October, 1843. 



Pectunculus. 



P. parilis. Orbicular, slightly oblique; height and length equal ; posterior 

 superior margin obliquely subtruncated ; ribs denned by slightly impressed 

 narrow radii ; radiating striee minute and obsolete ; marginal teeth prominent. 



Locality. Cliffs of Calvert, Md. 



Differs from P. carolinianus, in being oblique, narrower towards the beaks, 

 less convex, and in the much less prominent ribs, &c. 



Pecten. 



1. P. biformis. Inequivalved; superior valve nearly flat; inferior ventricose ; 

 ribs 5 or 6, on the umbo, large, convex, with minute reticulated striee; from a 

 concentric sulcus below the umbo, the ribs suddenly become less prominent, 

 very wide and composed of fasciculi of smaller irregular ribs; ears equal, 

 small. 



Locality. Petersburg, Va. Mr. Tuofney. 



This singular Pecten is allied to P. decemnarius, but the peculiar character of 

 the ribs is a sufficient distinction. The lower valve, from which the description 

 is chiefly taken, has large convex ribs above, longitudinally striated, and sepa- 

 rated by a concentric groove from the numerous small ribs below ; the interstices 

 have smaller costoe ; young shells have the superior valve frequently slightly 

 concave. 



2. P. tricenarius. Suborbicular; inferior valve convex, ribs 30 to 33, some- 

 what unequal in size, crossed by minute lines ; sinus of the ear profound. 



Locality. Found with the preceding species by Mr. Tuomey. 



3. P. vicenarhis. Suborbicular, inequivalved, the superior valve ventri- 

 cose, the inferior plano-convex ; ribs about 20, somewhat flattened on the back ; 

 ribs of superior valve narrower and more distant than those of inferior valve ; 

 surface of both with crowded regular concentric wrinkles; ears equal, moderate 

 in size; sinus of inferior valve not profound. 



Locality. Wilmington, N. C. Mr. Hodge. 



Teilina. 



1. T.lenis. Subelliptical ; beaks medial ; anterior margin obliquely trun- 

 cated, the extremity acutely rounded ; dorsal margins equally oblique ; posterior 

 basal margin obliquely subtruncated; basal margin nearly straight in the middle 

 and towards the anterior extremity where it is arched ; the extremity consider- 

 ably above the line of the base ; posterior side with an oblique narrow fold. 



Locality. Cliffs of Calvert, Md. 



2. T. arctata. Ovate, thin, slightly ventricose along the umbonial slope ; 

 flattened in the middle of the valve ; dorsal and basal margins parallel ; pos- 

 terior margin rounded obliquely inwards ; basal margin slightly contracted in 

 the middle ; beaks slightly prominent ; posterior dorsal margin slightly sinuous ; 

 surface with concentric prominent acute lines ; cardinal plate rather wide ; 

 lateral teeth none. 



Found in North Carolina, by Professor Mitchell, of Chapel Hill. 




October, 1843.] 307 



LuCINA. 



L. multlstriata. Oval, equilateral, slightly ventricose, with fine prominent 

 closely arranged concentric and minute radiating lines; disk with two or more 

 distinct undulations on the inferior half; beaks prominent ; dorsal margins 

 profoundly declining ; anterior lateral tooth distinct, remote ; inner margin 

 minutely crenulated; lunule elliptical, slightly impressed. Height one-third of 

 an inch. 



Locality. Wilmington, N. C. 



Amphidesma. 



A. asquata. Longitudinally oval, convex, with about 17 laminated concentric 

 stria?; anterior and posterior margins nearly equally rounded ; basal margin 

 very regularly rounded ; beaks slightly prominent ; one cardinal tooth in the 

 right valve, and no lateral teeth. Length less than one-third of an inch. 



Localities. St. Mary's Co., (Md.) Wilmington, N. C. 



Crassatella. 



C. turgidula. Oblong-ovate, slightly ventricose ; surface with coarse lines 

 of growth, and concentric undulations obsolete except on the umbones where 

 they are strongly marked and wide ; beaks submedial ; umbones flattened ; 

 anterior dorsal margin straight ; posterior extremity truncated and nearly direct, 

 more oblique in young shells; basal margin swelling a little anteriorly, posterior- 

 ly straight to the extremity which is obliquely angulated. 



Locality. Calvert Co., Md. 



Allied to C. Marylandica, but has less prominent, more flattened umbones, 

 which are widely and profoundly undulated. It is, also, more ventricose, and 

 has a more regularly arched basal margin. Young shells of the two species 

 are widely unlike each other. 



Crepidula. 



C. splnosa. Oval, ventricose, rather thick, with longitudinal rib-like series 

 of thick, elevated, foliated, erect spines, and coarse transverse wrinkles ; dia- 

 phragm sinuous, the margin profoundly sinuous. 



Locality. James River, near Smithfield, Va. 



Differs from C. cosiata, Morton, in wanting the numerous fine costfc, and in 

 having fewer, much longer, and thicker spines. 



Fulgtjr. 



F. rugosus. Pyriform, with rather coarse rugose revolving lines, disposed to 

 alternate in size, and very distinct numerous lines of growth ; whorls scalariform, 

 with a tubcrculated carina, the margin of which presents a waved outline, the 

 tubercles being obtuse ; spire prominent, profoundly channelled at the suture, 

 the margin of the channel carinated in young shells. Length 3 inches. 



Locality. St. Mary's River, Md. 



Compared with F. coronatus, this species, when adult, is comparatively 

 shorter and more inflated, with a shorter spire, much coarser revolving lines, 

 which with the more numerous, more obtuse tubercles, give the shell a very 

 different appearance from the coronatus. In an adult specimen of the latter 

 species there are 13 spiniform tubercles on the body whorl. In the allied species 



42

VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS. 



Dr. Chaloner called the attention of the Society to a number 

 of very fine specimens on the table of fossil bones of the Mastodon 

 and Elephant, brought by Mr. S. H.Whipple, from Benton Coun- 

 ty, Missouri, and forming part of a large collection in his posses- 

 sion, and now arranged for inspection in this city. A list was 

 presented by this gentleman, with an estimate of the weight of 

 the specimens, which he supposed to exceed 2000 lbs., accompa- 

 nied by the following statement: 



"These bones were found in the County of Benton, Missouri, 

 about one half mile from the river Osage, 70 miles south of the 

 Missouri river, at Boonville, in north latitude 38 10', and west 

 longitude 16 40'." After adverting to the character of this 

 portion of the county, which is broken up into ridges and rocky 

 elevations of considerable extent, with intervening vallies, through 

 which pass small streams of water, he says : "In one of the val- 

 lies referred to, just at the point where a fertile bottom is connec- 

 ted with a more elevated region, is a small marsh, perhaps of an 

 acre in extent. One half of this marsh is covered by a soil differ- 

 ent from that composing the marsh itself. This soil appears to 




322 [December, 1843. 



have been derived from the ground immediately adjoining it, 

 which is now a cultivated field, but was formerly covered with 

 oak timber. The field has a gentle slope towards the marsh from 

 a rocky ridge, composed partly of what appears to be limestone, 

 in irregular columns, of from 10 to 20 feet elevation above the 

 surrounding portion of the ridge, and its soil bears evidence of 

 having been washed from the ridge, and, as has been stated, now 

 forms part of the upper surface of the marsh. It was under this 

 deposit, and at the depth of from two to twelve feet, imbedded 

 in the marsh, that these bones were found, lying in the utmost 

 confusion, and disorder."

Descriptions of nineteen species of Tertiary fossils of Virginia and North 



Carolina, 



By T. A. Conrad. 



Anomia. 



Anoxia Ruffini. Subovate or suborbicular, irregular ; larger valve with 

 concentric lamins, sometimes obsolete, often closely arranged towards the base, 

 plicated on the margin ; disk with numerous irregular interrupted radiating fur- 

 rows and lines ; hinge area wide ; muscular impression very large, ovate-elon- 

 gated. Height of the largest specimen, two and a half inches. 



Locality. Pamunkey river, Kent county, Virginia. 



This fine large species was found by Edmund Ruffin, Esq., and I take plea- 

 sure in dedicating it to a gentlemen distinguished for his science, and his suc- 

 cessful and enlightened efforts to improve the agriculture of his country. 



Arca. 



Arca propatula. Rhomboidal, thick and ponderous; posterior side produced ; 

 sides flattened, slightly concave towards the base; uinbonial slope rounded, rather 

 elevated ; ribs about thirty-two, square, not profoundly prominent, about equal 

 in width to the interstices, which have transverse imbricated lines ; ribs largest 

 about the umbonial slope, very distinct on the posterior slope, which is con- 

 cave towards the hinge line ; posterior margin oblique, concave, extremity wide- 

 ly rounded ; summit of umbo moderately elevated, slightly retuse ; cardinal area 

 wide, with diverging grooves; series of teeth slightly sinuous anteriorly ; teeth 

 numerous ; at the posterior extremity, the series suddenly becomes dilated, and 

 the teeth interrupted or tubercular; inner margin crenate, crence profound, and 

 remote posteriorly. Length, four inches ; height, rather more than one and 

 one-third inches. 



Locality. James river, below City Point. Petersburg, Mr. Tuomey ; Ware 

 river, Gloucester county, Virginia, Mr. Kuffin. 



Perhaps this may prove to be an old specimen of A. arata, Say. 



44 




324 [December, 1S43. 



Arca scalaris. Obliquely rhomboidal, elevated, ventricose, ribs about twen- 

 ty-three, broad, square, prominent, profoundly and robustly crenate, wider than 

 the interstices, seven on the posterior slope, prominent; posterior slope flattened ; 

 umbonial slope angulated ; summit elevated, narrowed ; anterior margin oblique- 

 ly truncated ; anterior basal margin obliquely subtruncated ; posterior extremity 

 subangulated ; beaks remote; area with transverse slightly impressed lines; 

 cardinal teeth irregular, oblique towards the extremities of the hinge line ; within 

 with furrows corresponding to the ribs ; margin profoundly crenate. Length, 

 two inches ; height, one and a half inches. 



Locality. Petersburg, Virginia. Mr. Tuomey. 



Allied to A. incongrua, Say. The description applies to the left valve only, 

 as the opposite one has not yet been found. 



Ctrena. 



Ctrena densata. Subtriangular, thick, convex, with robust lines of growth ; 

 anterior margin obtusely rounded ; basal margin profoundly and regularly curved 

 to the posterior extremity, which is subtruncated, direct, and greatly above the 

 line of the base ; beaks central, summits elevated ; teeth large, robust, very pro- 

 minent, three in one valve, and two in the opposite ; middle tooth of the right 

 valve bifid ; lateral teeth elongated, robust, anterior tooth truncated, suddenly 

 deflected at the extremity ; posterior tooth distant. Length, one and a half 

 inches ; height, one inch and seven-eighths. 



Locality. Vicinity of Petersburg, Virginia. Mr. Tuomey. Rare. 



Mactra. 



Mactra triquetra. Triangular, thick, ventricose ; anterior margin obtusely 

 rounded; posterior margin obliquely truncated ; extremity angular; anterior 

 and basal margins regularly curved : posterior basal margin obliquely truncated, 

 and the disk slightly flattened above ; umbonial slope forming a right angle 

 with the posterior depression ; beaks slightly remote, central, summits profound- 

 ly elevated ; lateral teeth robust; fosset small, ovate. Length, one and a quar- 

 ter inches ; height one inch. 



Locality. Vicinity of Petersburg, Virginia. 



I found a single perfect valve of this species, which is much larger and pro- 

 portionally shorter than M. congesta, and differs especially in the beaks being 

 distant from the hinge margin. 



Venus. 



1. Venus capax. Cordate, suborbicular, ventricose, with concentric lamel- 

 liform prominent lines ; posterior margin curved, extremity truncated, direct, 

 and remote from the line of the base ; basal margin profoundly curved ; lunule 

 dilated, cordate, defined by a groove, and not distinctly impressed ; inner margin 

 finely crenulated. 



Locality. Pamunkey river, Kent county, Virginia. Mr. Tuomey. 

 This shell is of a more rotund, tumid form than any of the species allied to 

 V. mtrcmaria, and much more capacious ; the lunule is shorter and wider. 



2. Venus permagna. Subtriangular, cordate, profoundly ventricose, thick 

 and ponderous, with coarse concentric recurved rib-like lines, elevated, closely 




December, 1843.] 325 



arranged, and lamelliform on the sides; lunule cordate, elongated, defined by a 

 deeply impressed line ; posterior side subcuneiforrn, extremity obtusely rounded 

 or subtruncated ; cardinal plate broad: muscular impressions large; margin 

 strongly crenulated. Length, seven inches. 



V.permagna, Foss. of Tert. Formations, p. 9. 



Locality. Neuse river, below Newbern, North Carolina. Miocene ? 



This is perhaps the largest Venus known : it is remarkably rough and pon- 

 derous. In outline it approaches V. Rileyi, but it is greatly more ponderous 

 and ventricose. The usual size is about four and a half inches in length. 



Artemis. 



Artemis elegans. Lentiform, regularly convex, with strongly marked rather 

 distant impressed concentric lines ; on the posterior side these are closely ar- 

 ranged and profound, forming prominent recurved lines, which become acute or 

 lamelliform towards the posterior margin; posterior hinge margin elongated, 

 slightly convex, oblique; lunule cordate, deeply impressed. Height, two and a 

 half inches; length, two inches and seven-eighths. 



A. elegans. Fossils of Tertiary Formations, p. 30. 



Locality. Neuse river, below Newbern, North Carolina. Miocene. 



This beautiful shell is allied to A. concentrica, but is readily distinguished by 

 its stronger remoter stria, by its convexity of disk, and its more robust anterior 

 cardinal teeth ; the posterior teeth are less oblique, forming a wider space be- 

 tween them and the anterior teeth. The posterior hinge margin is not so elong- 

 ated, in proportion, as in the concentrica. 



I found this and the kindred species recent on Mullet Key, at the entrance 

 of Tampa Bay, and, fortunately, specimens of the young of both, which show a 

 marked difference in specific character. 



Loripes. 



Loripes elevata. Suborbicular, elevated, thin, ventricose, smooth, not oblique; 

 beaks medial; hinge margins very oblique ; posterior margin truncated, direct, 

 very regularly rounded towards the base ; anterior basal margin obliquely trun- 

 cated ; cardinal plate thin, arched, with an elongated channel anteriorly ; cardi- 

 nal teeth profoundly diverging. Length, nine-sixteenths of an inch ; height, 

 the same. 



Locality. Neuse river, below Newbern, North Carolina. Miocene 1 ? 



Proportionally more elevated than Loripes americana (Mysia,) thinner, not 

 oblique like that species, and very distinct. 



Solex. 



1. Soien directus. Linear, straight, except towards the summit, where it 

 is slightly recurved, gradually widening from the hinge downwards ; basal mar- 

 gin rounded slightly towards the posterior extremity ; anterior margin obliquely 

 truncated, not reflected ; cardinal teeth, one in the "right valve, compressed, in 

 the opposite valve, two, the superior one very small and near the extremity, the 

 other somewhat distant, elevated, robust, slightly recurved. Length, four 

 inches. 



Locality. Neuse river, below Newbern, North Carolina. Miocene 1 




326 [December, 1843. 



I am doubtful of the geological age of the three fossils above described, as we 

 know not the group among which they occur. 



2. Soles ensiformis. Linear, slightly curved, gradually narrowed from 

 the middle to the posterior extremity, which is subcuneiform ; anterior margin 

 obliquely subtruncated. Length, three inches. 



Locality. St. Mary's river, Maryland. Miocene. 



TcHRITELLA. 



Turritella hipertlta. Turrited, thick ; suture profoundly excavated; whorls 

 flattened, divided nearly in the middle by a deeply impressed revolving line, 

 margined on each side by a fine impressed line ; inferior volutions carinated at 

 base; lines of growth oblique, meeting at an angle at the groove in the middle 

 of each volution. Length, ; width, seven-eighths of an inch. 



Locality. Vicinity of Petersburg, Virginia. Mr. Tuomey. 



This large species is very distinct from all others, and remarkable for the pro- 

 found channel between the whorls. 



ScALARIA. 



Scalaria procera. Subulate, turrited, volutions scalariform, contracted in- 

 feriorly, with obsolete revolving impressed lines : ribs thick, elevated, reflected, 

 distant, with sharp triangular reflected aculeii on the shoulder of each volution; 

 base with a revolving interrupted carina; aperture longitudinally obtusely oval. 



Length, ; width of body whorl, nearly half an inch ; three volutions 



from the base measure one inch. 



Locality. Vicinity of Petersburg. Mr. Tuomey. 



Pleurotoma. 



Pleurotoma multisecta. Turrited, with closely arranged deeply impressed 

 revolving lines, and longitudinal robust prominent ribs; superior portion of each 

 whorl destitute of ribs, with minute revolving lines, and a sharp revolving slight- 

 ly undulating carina margining the suture; aperture elliptical, rather more than 

 one-third the length of the shell. Length, one and one-eighth of an inch; greatest 

 width, three-eighths of an inch. 



Locality. Vicinity of Petersburg. Mr. Tuomey. 



BuCCINUM. 



Buccinum harpuloides. Ovate, ventricose, with alternated revolving raised 

 lines, and longitudinal slightly oblique rather distant narrow elevated ribs: spire 

 scalariform, volutions five; base of the shell with an acute oblique carina; aper- 

 ture half the length of the shell ; columella profoundly concave, with a promi- 

 nent fold or carina on the angle formed by the obliquely truncated base ; a slight 

 protuberance near the superior extremity of the aperture; margin of labrum 

 nearly straight, suddenly rounded inferiorly. Length, one inch ; width, five- 

 eighths of an inch. 



Fusus 7 



Fusus 1 cannabinus. Fusiform ; whorls six or seven, with longitudinal 

 rounded costae, and revolving prominent alternated lines finely wrinkled trans- 

 versely ; spire somewhat scalariform, elevated ; suture undulated; body whorl 




December, 1S43.] 327 



abruptly rounded at base; beak short, subperforate, tortuous ; aperture with the 

 channel rather less than half the length of the shell ; labrum with eight short 

 dentiform prominent strice within. Length, one inch and a quarter. 



Locality. Petersburg, Virginia. Mr. Tuomey. 



Closely resembles Fusus cinereus, Say, but the whorls are more scalariform, 

 and the body whorl much shorter and more abrupt at base ; the beak narrower 

 and more tortuous. 



Terebra. 



Terebra curvilirata. Subulate, whorls with a revolving impressed line be- 

 low and near the suture; beneath this line the whorls are convex; ribs longi- 

 tudinal, curved, acute, dislocated by the impressed line ; revolving lines minute, 

 crowded, obsolete ; columella sinuous. Length, one and a quarter inches. 



Locality. St. Mary's river, Maryland. 



Differs from Cerithium dislocatum, Say, in wanting the distinct revolving 

 lines, and the small dislocated portion of the ribs are not of a tubercular form ; 

 the aperture is longer and narrower. 



POLYPARIA. 



TtTRBINOtlA. 



Ttjrbiuolia pileolus. Obtusely obconical, slightly compressed, periphery 

 with an oval outline ; lamellce smooth, of equal thickness, united to an elliptical 

 centre; between each plate is one, sometimes two, short irregular lamellae, 

 either free or united to the base of the larger rays. Length, nearly half inch, 

 diameter, half inch. 



Locality. Pamunkey River, Kent Co., Virg. Mr. Tuomey. 



ECHINODERMATA. 



Spatahgus. 



Spatangus orthonotus. Ovate, convex-depressed ; truncated at each end, 

 more elevated anteriorly than posteriorly ; dorsal line of the suture a little ele- 

 vated, and curved gradually to the mouth on the anterior half; on the posterior, 

 straight to the margin and parallel to the base ; canal very wide and slightly 

 impressed on the back, margined by an obtuse carinated line and slight furrow ; 

 on the periphery the canal is deep and angular; ambulacra rapidly expanding 

 from the extremities towards the dorsal suture ; pores disunited ; in the middle 

 of the back a slight furrow crosses obliquely each of the anterior ambulacra at 

 its termination ; base plano-convex; anus large and remote from the margin; 

 granulations on the back minute and very closely arranged, in the canal much 

 larger and unequal in size ; base with large tubercles, becoming gradually 

 smaller and more closely arranged towards the margins. Length, two inches 

 and three-eighths ; diameter, two inches and an eighth ; height, one inch and 

 an eighth. 



Locality. Near Coggins' Point, James River, Virginia. Mr. Tuomey. 




328 [December, 1843. 



Observations. 



In 328 species of organic remains already described, independent of minute 

 and uncertain forms, 43 have been found in a recent state; and when to these 

 are added numerous very small shells which are found in every careful examina- 

 tion of marl from the various localities, the percentage of recent species may be 

 pretty accurately estimated at about 11 or 12 per cent. This result I have ob- 

 tained by a careful exploration of the fossilliferous beds, and two visits to the 

 shores of Florida and Alabama to procure recent forms for comparison with 

 those of the Miocene strata. The last trip furnished three recent shells before 

 known only in the fossil state. 



Several species described in the preceding pages I obtained during a recent 

 excursion to Petersburg, Virginia, at the kind invitation of Mr. Tuomey. In 

 the course of a few hours examination of the marl in the vicinity in three or 

 four days, I collected about 100 distinct species. This locality is peculiarly 

 interesting, being the western limit of the Miocene, having a considerable eleva- 

 tion above tide, and based on granite, it is the spot in which to search for the 

 estuary and fresh water shells of the Miocene period. Mr. Tuomey has already 

 found an extinct Cyrena, and a univalve not very unlike* Paiundina sub- 

 purpurea, (Say,) whilst I discovered a species of Cerithium, identical with a 

 shell which I found last spring inhabiting oyster beds in the Manitee river, 

 near its junction with Tampa Bay. It is about the size and nearly resembles 

 C. trilineatum, figured in Kiener's work. 



The elevation of the Petersburg Miocene is considerably more than 100 feet 

 above tide, and as the rise decreases towards the sea, it is probable that the pri- 

 mary rocks continued to be uplifted even after the era of the Miocene ; indeed 

 how can we otherwise account for the elevation of fossilliferous beds, even of 

 those of the Post-Pliocene period ? 



It is an interesting fact that the Miocene estuaries were inhabited by two 

 species of bivalves, now extinct, of the same two genera which still occur in simi- 

 lar situations in Florida and Alabama, that is at the confluence of rivers and bays, 

 where the water is nearly fresh. These genera are Gnathodon and Cyrena, 

 both of the family Ctrenad.tj. The extinct Gnathodon has a considerable 

 resemblance to the recent species, but the Cyrena is widely different from the 

 living shell. These fossils are frequently water-worn, always with disunited 

 valves, and appear to have been transported. Occasionally a specimen occurs 

 not in the least abraded, a circumstance which indicates the vicinity of the 

 Petersburg deposits to the mouth of a river. The strata occur in a meadow, 

 and consist of blue marl of a sandy texture, often intermixed with small gravel, 

 and of ferruginous sand, full of shells ; there is here also a proportion of gravel, 

 of rounded quartz, occasionally of large size. Water-worn fragments of 

 bivalves are abundantly intermingled with entire shells, and many species occur 

 with connected valves. This is particularly the case with the burrowing shells, 

 as Panopoea, but also, though less frequently, with the large Venus tridacnoides, 

 Crassatella undulata, Astahte concentrica, Cytherea albaria, two species 

 of Chama, and even two species of Ostrea are not uncommon ; but there is 

 nothing like an oyster bed in these strata which might indicate shoal water. The 



P. glaber, (Terbo glaber, Lea.) 




December, 1843.] 329 



proportion of oysters to the other bivalves is about the same which the dredge 

 furnished at the mouth of Cape Fear river, N. C. at the depth of 8 fathoms. 



"With the many interesting bivalves of Petersburg I found a valve of the 

 beautiful 



Pholadomya abrupta. 



which Deshayes has referred to Panopoea. I carefully removed the marl from 

 the hinge, in order to ascertain if there was an erect curved tooth as in Pan- 

 opcea, but the hinge proved to be destitute of any kind of tooth or process, and 

 closely resembles that of the recent Pholadomya. Two characters, therefore, 

 remove this shell from the genus Panopcea,- the pearliness of the substance and 

 the absence of a cardinal tooth. A true panopoea is never pearly, any more 

 than a Unio is ever otherwise. 



Observations on the Lead Bearing Limestone of Wisconsin, and descriptions 

 of a new genus of Trilobites and fifteen new Silurian fossils. 



By T. A. Conrad. 



As the galeniferous limestone of Wisconsin and Galena has attracted the 

 attention of our most distinguished Geologists, who have endeavored to assign 

 its relative position in the scale of formations, I hope it may not be deemed pre- 

 sumptuous if I endeavor to assist in settling a question of so much importance. 

 The difficulty has hitherto arisen from the scarcity and obscurity of characteris- 

 tic fossils, which is now in a great measure removed. Some years since I had 

 the pleasure of examining a series of organic remains collected by Richard C. 

 Taylor, Esq. at the lead mines in Wisconsin, and then distinctly recognized the 

 species which belong to the Trenton limestone of New York, a rock which, in 

 my first report on the Geology of New York, I showed to be an independant 

 formation, and entirely distinct from any above or below it. Since then I have 

 proved its occurrence at Cincinnati, in Ohio, and at Carlisle and Bedford 

 Springs, Pennsylvania. In these remote localities the fossils are generally the 

 same species, and the group of a unity which admits not of doubt or ambiguity. 



The specimens found by Mr. R. C.Taylor are chiefly from the limestone below 

 the lead, and consist of Bellerofhron bilobatus, (Sowerby.) 



There are also specimens of fossiliferous limestone from Cassville, Wisconsin, 

 of the same age, containing a Trenton limestone species of Orthis, like C. callac- 

 tis, a Naculite, occurring also near Middleville, N. Y., Belleuofhron bilo. 

 batus, a Strophomena like Orthis alternata, Sowerby, a common shell in the 

 New York Trenton limestone, and an Orthis resembling O. tcstudinaria, still 

 more abundant in the same rock. 



In the same collection are carboniferous fossils, in limestone and in chert, from 

 St. Genevieve, Missouri. The species consist of a large Bellerophron, 

 three species of Productus and one of Atrypa, all of which are found only in 

 the carboniferous or mountain limestone. 



I am indebted to the liberality of Mr. Stephen Taylor, who has recently re- 

 turned to this city from Mineral Point, Wisconsin Territory, for an opportunity 




330 [December, 1843. 



to investigate some organic remains of more than ordinary interest, which that 

 gentleman procured at the lead mines. Accompanying these are specimens of 

 fossiliferous limestone, shells, and fragments of Trilobites in beautiful relief 

 upon the surface, and so familiar and characteristic, that at the first glance I 

 recognized the Trenton limestone of New York. The most prominent of these 

 fossils consist of the trilobites, Ceratjrcs pleurexanthemus,Is<yvEivs gigas, and 



Ill23nus , and of the shells, Strophomen a sericea, Phragmoljtes 



compressus, and Bellerophron bilobatus. With these are a large Cytherina, 

 known also to occur in the Trenton limestone of New York: the Terebra- 

 tula (Atrypa) Schlottheimii of Von Buch, and some beautiful new species of 

 bivalves. The limestone is very compact, replete with shells and favosites, of 

 a light color, inclining to drab, and it immediately underlies the rock in which 

 the galena occurs, as Mr. Taylor informs me. Many of the fossils are loose 

 and exceedingly well preserved, having apparently come from a soft limestone 

 shale. 



In examining, a few years since, some specimens of limestone brought from 

 Galena, by the late lamented Nicollet, and which he informed me, was ihe rock 

 immediately below the lead-bearing strata, I recognized the group of fossils 

 which characterize the Trenton limestone, but Mr. Nicollet was unable to pro- 

 cure any organic remains from the overlying rock, which might furnish a clue 

 to its geological age. Mr. Taylor has fortunately obtained this desirable object, 

 in Wisconsin, having discovered not only well preserved fossils, in the lead-bear- 

 ing formation, but even shells and remains of crinoidea replaced by the 

 sulphuret of lead. There is particularly the cast of a large Turritella com- 

 posed entirely of this mineral, and a specimen of Pleurotomaria anguluta, 

 which is a limestone cast, with the upper part of the spire of galena, and from 

 fragments yet remaining between the caste and matrix, it is evident that the 

 shell itself had been replaced by the sulphuret of lead. These two shells are 

 not uncommon in the Trenton limestone of Lewis county, New York. The 

 Turritella I have never known to occur in any other formation but the Phuro- 

 tomaria I found also in the Salmon river, or Pulaski shale, near Rome, Oneida 

 county. Mr. Taylor has likewise a crinoidal column, almost wholly replaced 

 by galena: it has distant very prominent rings or ridges, and is a species which 

 has been observed in the Trenton limestone of New York. 



From the evidence it is clear that the limestone of Galena, Illinois, and of 

 Mineral Point, Wisconsin, in which the lead occurs, is certainly not of more 

 recent date than the Pulaski and Lorraine shales of New York, and the cara- 

 doc sandstone of Great Britain : but I believe it will prove to be an upper mem- 

 ber of the Trenton limestone formation. 



Mr. Taylor has also a specimen of Trenton limestone, precisely similar to 

 that of Galena and Mineral Point, which was found in Wisconsin, 40 miles 

 N. E. of Galena. 



There is a specimen of the sulphuret of lead, among the cubes of which is 

 imbedded a single valve of Strophomena, very thin and silicified. 



Mr. Taylor brought the Pentamerus oblongus, Catexipora escharoides, 

 and C. labyrinthica, which were found together on one of the hillocks or 

 mounds," as they are termed in Wisconsin. These two fossils, when associ-

ated, characterize the upper part of the Caradoc sandstone, (Clinton group of 

 New York.) 



The lead-bearing rock is a buff colored granular limestone, and contains 

 the following species of organic remains, all of which have been found in the 

 Trenton limestone, except the two printed in italics : 



U?iivalves. Bivalves. 



Inachus pervetus, Con. Orthis testudinaria. ? 



Pleurotomaria angulata, Sowerby. Delthyris 



Turritella Strophomena sericea. 



Coral. 

 Cyathophyllum profundum, Con. 



There is also the post-abdomen of an undetermined trilobiteand various forms 

 of crinoideal vertebrae. 



In the Trenton limestone of Mineral Point, the following species of organic 

 remains were collected by Mr. Taylor : 



Shells. Shells. 



Cyrtoceras marginalis, Con. Orthis disparilis, Con. 



Orthoceras annellus, Con. perveta, Con. 



Phragmolites compressus, Con. tricenaria, Con. 



Turritella bellarugosa, Con. 



Pleurotomaria angulata, Sowerby. subequata, Con. 



Bellerophron bilobatus, Sow. Atrypa (Tereb.) Schlottheimii, (Von 



Euomphalus triliratus, Con. Buch.) 



Inachus pervetus, Con. Nuculites, 2 species. 



Subulites elongata. 



Crustacea. 



Delthyris 



Strophomena sericea, Sow. Ceraurus pleurexanthemus, Green. 



deflecta, Con. Isotelus gigas, Dekay. 



recta, Con. Thaleops ovata, Con. 



Orthis testudinaria 1 Cy therina fabulites, Con. 



Thaleops. 



Capite lunato, trilobato, oculis distantibus, eminentissimis, non reticulatis ; 

 trunco 10-articulato, valde trilobato ; lateribus expansis, medio angulatis ; costis 

 integris ; post-abdomine trilobato, minimo ; costis nullis. 



Ovate, profoundly trilobed, lateral lobes wider than the middle lobe ; buckler 

 lunate, with very remote oculine tubercles, not reticulated ; abdomen with 10-ar- 

 ticulations ; ribs without grooves and not alternated in size ; outer half of lateral 

 lobes suddenly depressed ; post-abdomen without ribs or grooves and profoundly 

 trilobed. 



This genus is remarkable for the great width of the buckler, and the very 

 prominent laterally projecting smooth oculine tubercles. It differs from Bumas- 

 tus in being profoundly lobed, and in having the side lobes as in Asaphus much 



45 




332 [December, 1843. 



wider than the middle lobe. From Illaenus it may be distinguished by its 

 ovate form, want of reticulated eyes, the width of the lateral lobes, and the 

 profound lobes of the tail. 



The genus Thakops characterises the Trenton limestone formation of the 

 Lower Silurian group. 



Thaleops ovata. Obtusely ovate, surface minutely punctate; head very wide, 

 lunate, involuted ; eyes very prominent, rounded, smooth, placed on a line with 

 the angle in the middle of the side lobes; ribs flattened, smooth, without a bor- 

 der at the extremities where they are rounded and not expanded; post-abdomen 

 with the middle lobe convex, rounded and well defined at the extremity ; inferior 

 margin obtusely rounded. Length two-thirds of an inch: width of buckler 

 three-quarters of an inch. 



Locality. Mineral Point, Wisconsin, (blue limestone quarry,) Mr. Taylor. 



This rare trilobite may be studied as well in Mr. Brano's excellent model, as 

 in the natural specimen. It is probably a rare fossil that few naturalists will be 

 able to procure, and for this reason we would recommend the model to those who 

 are desirous to have a knowledge of the genus. 



Wherever many entire trilobites are found, a very quiescent state of the 

 waters wherein the rock which contained them was deposited, may be inferred 

 from the abundance of scattered bucklers and post-abdomens, which occur in other 

 strata where there is no evidence of violence on any of the delicate shells accom- 

 panying them ; the articulations of the abdomen were therefore held together by 

 a frail ligament, whilst the post-abdomen although ribbed in many species, was 

 in all composed of an inarticulated crust and thus is almost always preserved en- 

 tire in the rock. 



CRUSTACEA. 



Cytherina. 



Cytherin a fabulites. Ovate, reniform, smooth, with a slightly concave or 

 truncated cardinal margin, the extremities of which are angulated; end margins

The Recording Secretary then read his Annual Report, 

 which was ordered to be published in the Proceedings. 



REPORT 



OF THE 

 RECORDING SECRETARY 

 For the year 1843. 



In the Report, which a twelvemonth since, in accordance with the estab- 

 lished rule of this Institution, it became my duty to present, it was the design 

 throughout to place before you a candid statement, embracing t very circum- 

 stance which it was believed would tend to give an encourageing view of 

 its condition at that time, and of its future prospects. 



A review of its proceedings for the present year will furnish conclusive 

 evidence that we have continued reason to be gratified with its position and 

 success. 



At home and abroad, its members, correspondents, and friends have 

 given ample proof of their zeal and interest in its welfare. The contribu- 

 tions to its Library and Collections have equalled those of former years ; 

 its usefulness has been thereby increased, and the field for investigation 

 and the study of the Natural Sciences enlarged. In all the departments 

 this has been the case, as the following summary will show : 



In Geology and Mineralogy there have been received twenty-three do- 

 nations from the following: Drs. Burrough ; Morton; Elwyn ; 

 Blanding; Lafon ; Goheen, of Liberia,"Africa; D. D. Owen, of 

 New Harmony, Indiana; Fussell, of Indiana; B. B. Brown, of 

 St. Louis; Professors Forchey, of Natchez, and H. D. Rogers; and 

 from Messrs. French and Demestre, of New Orleans; Codwise, 

 of St. Croix; J. Cassin ; S. B. Ashmead ; VV. S. Vaux ; G. R. 

 Gliddon ; Marsh ; Land ; Lessig, and Stephen Taylor, Jr. 



In Ornithology, eight donations, from Dr. G. Watson, and Messrs. 

 J. Cassin; Baird, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania; J. G. Strain, 

 U. S. N. ; J. Dundas, and Miss Percival, of Philadelphia. 



In Zoology, three donations, by Mr. Cassin, and Dr. Wm. Blanding. 



In Entomology, ten donations, by Drs. Watson, Owen, and Blanding; 

 and Messrs. Kilvington, Ashmead, Cassin, and Strain. 



In lcthyology, six donations, by Dr. J. Carson ; and Messrs. Cassin, 

 W. B. Maull, and Philip Lowry, Jr. 



In Herpetology, seven donations, by Messrs. James Read ; W. S. Vaux; 

 J. G. Strain; B. M. Norman, of New Orleans; and Drs. Go- 

 heen; C. W. Pennock; and P. B. Goddard. 




336 [December, 1843. 



In Helminthology, one donation, by Mr. William G. Burke. 



In Conehology, seven donations, by Messrs. J. G. Anthony,*of Cin- 

 cinnati ; C. M. Wheatley, of New York ; Dr. J. C. Jay, of do. ; 

 Professor Forchey ; Mr. Thomas Beasley, of New Jersey ; and 

 Messrs. Ashmead and Cassin. 



In Osteology, two donations, by the Messrs. Baird, of Carlisle, and 

 Dr. Goheen. 



In Botany, five donations, by Messrs. J. N. Nicollet ; P. A. Browne; 

 Mr. Codwise, of St. Croix; Mrs. Wm. S. Biddle, of Phila- 

 delphia, and Dr. Goheen. 



The most interesting- and valuable accession to the Museum during the 



it 



year has been that of an articulated skeleton of an adult male Chimpan- 

 zee, Troglodytes niger, Geoff., received from Dr. S. M. E. Goheen, of 

 Liberia, Africa, and one of the Correspondents of this Institution. The 

 skeleton is deficient only in the sternum, the two patellae, and some of the 

 smaller phalanges of the feet and hands. For these, similar bones of a 

 young human subject have been substituted, so that the specimen appears 

 perfect. 



I have the satisfaction to state that during the last season the interest in 

 the Entomological department has been revived, and that to several 

 sources, but especially to our fellow members, the Messrs. Ashmead, Mr. 

 Kilvington and Dr. Watson, is the Academy indebted for a considerable 

 accession of native insects. For a long period, little or no effort has been 

 made in this department. The valuable collection presented to the Aca- 

 demy by the late Mr. Say has been entirely lost or destroyed, and the 

 beautifully arranged and costly cabinet of Drs. McMurtrie and Pickering 

 has very nearly shared the same fate. Of other minor donations the bare 

 fragments can be found. Various plans have been resorted to, in the hope 

 of preventing these losses, but hitherto without success. Under such dis- 

 couragements, it is not surprising that this department should have been 

 neglected of late. To the donations mentioned, have been added the best 

 and most perfect specimens selected from the collection of Drs. McMurtrie 

 and Pickering, and all have been carefully disinfected by exposing them to a 

 high temperature for many hours. A new method for preserving them 

 from future injury has been adopted, which it is believed will be effectual. 



The collection of Reptilia, during the last summer has been removed from 

 the Hair to the room on the ground floor, and now occupies the cases 

 formerly containing the collection of crania belonging to Dr. Morton. 

 The members must have observed great improvement in the new 

 arrangement of the specimens, which have been greatly increased in 

 number, and each one carefully examined, the bottles and jars contain- 

 ing them refilled with alcohol, and new labels added. In fact, the extent 

 and value of this collection could not previously be properly appreciated. 

 It will now bear comparison with any in this country. 



The large and fine collection of Birds in skin, possessed by the Academy, 

 has been thoroughly overhauled, and the imperfect specimens, or which 

 had sustained injury from insects, have been removed, and the rest disin- 

 fected by exposing them to a high temperature in a large copper apparatus 

 provided for the purpose. The collection is now in the best order for 

 mounting or exchange. 




December, 1S43.] 337 



The accessions to the Library have exceeded those of the year previous. 

 They consist of one Folio; eleven works in quarto form, including the 

 Memoirs and Transactions of learned Societies ; sixty-five octavos and 

 duodecimos, including Journals, Annals, Bulletins, &c; and seventy-two 

 productions in pamphlet form, or in numbers, consisting of Reports, Pro- 

 ceedings of Societies, addresses, discourses, memoirs, &c. To these are 

 to be added several manuscripts, charts and engraved copper plates. Of 

 the whole number contributed, twenty-nine have been derived from Socie- 

 ties, k sixty-three from Members, and the remainder, amounting to sixty- 

 seven, from correspondents, authors, editors, &c. 



The papers read before the Society, and published in its Proceedings 

 between the 1st of January and 1st of November of the present year, aie 

 four in number. The first is by Mr. William Gambel, of this city, and 

 contains descriptions of some new and rare birds of the Rocky Mountains 

 and California, the tour of which he has recently made. The second is 

 from the Messrs. Baird, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and describes two new 

 species of Tyrannula, from Cumberland county, Pennsylvania. The third by 

 Mr. Haldeman, is entitled a "Catalogue of the Carabideous Coleoptera of 

 South Eastern Pennsylvania, and descriptions of new North American 

 species of Coleoptera :" and the fourth paper entitled " Descriptions of a new 

 genus, and of twenty -nine new Miocene, and one Eocene fossil shells of 

 the United States," is contributed by Mr. T. A. Conrad. 



The publication of the Proceedings has been regularly continued during 

 the year. It has now attained sufficient bulk to authorise the Committee 

 to bring the first volume to a close with the coming number. On the first 

 of November last, two years and seven months had elapsed since the first 

 number was commenced, and in that period 311 pages of matter selected 

 from the minutes of the meeting have been issued, or an average of about 

 120 pages annually. As every care is taken in the style and execution of 

 this periodical, to render it worthy of the Institution whence it emanates, 

 and a considerable expenditure is therefore incurred, it is proposed to give 

 here a condensed summary of the contents of the present volume, as far as 

 published, in order that some idea may be formed of its merits and utility. 



Its first and most obvious advantage is in being a medium for commu- 

 nicating to the scientific public discoveries and observations at short 

 intervals of time, and thus often enabling the claim to priority to be 

 securely established. There have been, with this view, offered to the So- 

 ciety, and printed either entire or in part in its Proceedings, during the 

 period above mentioned, upwards of thirty original papers on scientific 

 subjects, the titles and authors of which are as follows: 



By Dr. S. G. Morton, two papers, viz., " Descriptions of several new 

 fossil shells from the cretaceous deposits of the United States," and "De- 

 scriptions of two new species of fossils from the lower cretaceous strata of 

 New Jersey." By Mr. T. A. Conrad, three papers; "Descriptions of 

 three new species of Unio from the rivers of the United States ;" " De- 

 scriptions of twenty-six new species of fossil shells from the medial ter- 

 tiary of Calvert Cliffs, Maryland," and " Descriptions of a new genus, 

 and of twenty-nine new Miocene, and one Eocene, fossil shells of the 

 United States." By Professor Johnson, two papers; "An examination 

 and analysis of coal from Arauco, Chili;" and " On the relation between 

 the coal of South Wales and some Pennsylvania Anthracites." By Mr. 

 Phillips, three papers; "Descriptions of two new American species of 




33s [December, 1843. 



Helix ;" " Memorandum of dates of publication of papers in the early 

 numbers of the Journal of the Academy," and "On the nomenclature of 

 Natural Science." By Mr. Haldeman,the following papers: "Descrip- 

 tions of new species of Cyclas ;" several on new species of Cypris; "De- 

 scriptions of two new fresh-water shells of the genera Amnicola and 

 Physa;" "of another new species of Cyclas;" "of a genus of Sterel- 

 mintha ;"" of two species of Entomostraca, and two Hydrachnae;" "of 

 a new Daphnia;" several on changes of nomenclature in Natural History; 

 a " Catalogue of the Carabideous Coleoptera of South Eastern Pennsyl- 

 vania, and descriptions of new species of North American Coleoptera;" 

 and " Description of a new species of Pasimachus." By Dr. Halloweil, 

 a paper describing a new species of Chamaeleon from Africa. By Dr. 

 Benj. H. Coates, a paper on "The natural alliances of the genus Cecido- 

 myia." By Peter A. Browne, Esq., a portion of a paper containing stric- 

 tures on terms used in vegetable physiology. By Mr. William Gambel, 

 " Descriptions of some new and rare Birds of the Rocky mountains and 

 California." By the Messrs. Baird, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, "Descrip- 

 tions of two new species of Tyrannula from Cumberland county, Pennsyl- 

 vania." By Professor Locke, of Cincinnati, "Observations on Crypto- 

 lithus tesselatus." By J. Hamilton Couper, of Georgia, " A description 

 of the strata in which were found the valuable fossil bones and shells 

 from the Brunswick Canal," presented by him to the Academy. By Dr. 

 Clapp, of New Albany, Indiana, a paper in reference to the geological 

 equivalents of that vicinity, and of those of the falls of the Ohio. By 

 Miss Morris, of Germantown, " Observations on the development of the 

 Hessian fly." By Messrs. Audubon and Bachman, " Descriptions of 

 new species of North American Quadrupeds;" and by Dr. Ravenel, of 

 Charleston, " Descriptions of several new fossil Scutellae." 



The communications made before the Society in a verbal form, and re- 

 corded in the Proceedings, are even more numerous, and contain much in- 

 formation on important and interesting facts in natural science. The 

 limits to which this Report is necessarily restricted, will only admit 

 of the mention of the names of those gentlemen who have most largely 

 contributed to this portion of the Proceedings. There are from Dr. 

 Morton, six communications ; from Prof. Johnson, twenty ; Prof. Rogers, 

 five ; Mr. S. S. Haldeman, four; Dr. B. H. Coates, three; Mr. Phillips, 

 two ; Dr. George C. Leib, three : Dr. Chaloner, four ; Mr. Joseph A. Clay, 

 one; Dr. Blanding, one; Dr. Bridges, two; Prof. Bailey of West Point, 

 one; Mr. Quimby, two ; Dt. Goddard, five; Mr. George R. Gliddon, 

 two ; Dr. Elwyn, one ; and from Dr. Owen, of New Harmony, two. 



This publication also records for the period mentioned, 219 donations to 

 the Museum of the Society from 110 individuals; and 281 donations to 

 its Library, 68 of which are from Societies, and 213 from individuals. 



Another most important advantage derived from it is in its general dis- 

 tribution to foreign and domestic Societies and Correspondents. Nearly 

 one hundred and fifty copies of each number as it appears are sent, not 

 only in every direction throughout the Union, but to various sections of 

 the globe, and a correct knowledge of the character and standing of this 

 Institution is thus widely diffused. 1 have transcribed from the Memo- 

 randum Book of the Corresponding Secretary, the following list of Socie- 

 ties receiving copies of the Proceedings, either regularly or as opportunity 

 offers : 



Royal Society of London ; Botanical Society of London ; Zoological 




December, 1S43.J 339 



Society of do. ; Linnean Society of do. ; L'lnstitute Royale de France ; 

 Ecole Royale des Mines, at Paris; Societe Entomologique de Paris; The 

 Royal Society of Edinburg ; L'Academie Royale des Sciences, Stockholm ; 

 L'Academie Royale des Sciences et Belles Lettres, Brussels ; Academia 

 de Ciencias Naturales, Madrid ; L'Accademia Reale delle Scienze, Turin ; 

 Societe Imperialedes Naturalistesde Moscou; Royal Academy of Sciences 

 of Berlin; Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg; Royal Academy of 

 Sciences of Munich ; Royal Botanical Society, Ratisbon; Asiatic Society 

 of Bengal ; and the Egyptian Society at Cairo. 



The domestic Societies are as follows : 



American Philosophical Society; Franklin Institute; Philadelphia 

 Athenaeum ; Albany Institute ; New York Lyceum of Natural History ; 

 Natural History Society of Boston ; National Institute at Washington ; 

 Franklin Society of Providence, Rhode Island ; U. S. Naval Lyceum at 

 Brooklyn ; and Northern Academy of Arts and Sciences at Hanover, New 

 Hampshire. 



Letters of acknowledgement of the reception of the Proceedings by these 

 Societies, and by numerous Correspondents, are constantly read before 

 you. 



In short, the reputation of this Institution has been greatly enhanced 

 since the adoption of this mode of publishing periodically an account of 

 its Transactions, and the propriety of its continuance cannot be ques- 

 tioned. 



Three alterations in the By-Laws have been made during the present 

 year. The first reduces the amount of the Initiation fee from $10 to $5, 

 and the second reduces the amount of a life subscription from $80 to 50. 

 Both of these alterations have been in contemplation for a length of time, 

 but no action determined on until within the last few months, when the 

 expediency and even necessity of adopting them were so obvious as not to 

 admit of longer delay. The third alteration requires of Correspondents 

 residing within the United States, elected after the 31st of January, 1843, 

 a small diploma fee. This is a measure which the Society is justly en- 

 titled to adopt, and is only in accordance with the usage of most Institu- 

 tions of a similar character. The demand has been cheerfully complied 

 with in every instance where the receipt of his notice of election has been 

 acknowledged by a Correspondent. 



Between the 1st of January and the 1st of December of this year the 

 Academy has added eleven new Members and twenty-one Correspondents 

 to its list. Of the latter, twelve reside in the United States, and nine 

 are foreign. The number of members elected is nearly double the average 

 of the three preceding years. 



The finances of the Academy are in a most favourable condition, as the 

 Report of the Treasurer will show. The right of way to a small portion 

 of the lot in the rear of the building, was disposed of in the early part of 

 the year for the sum of $660, to the holders of the adjoining property. 

 The offer was an advantageous one to the Academy, and was promptly ac- 

 cepted by it. A heavy ground rent held by the original owners of the lot 

 on which this building is erected, has been recently paid off by the next 

 purchaser. This is a source of some gratification to the Academy, as re- 



46

lieving it from a possible contingency which might involve its interests in 

 some degree. By the prudent management of the Treasurer, the Institu- 

 tion has been enabled to meet all its ordinary annual expenses, and some 

 new arrangements for the coming year proposed by him, will, if carried out, 

 materially lessen its remaining obligations, which, although now compa- 

 ratively light, still prevent that entire appropriation of its annual income 

 to the general purposes of the Institution, which is so ardently desired 

 by all its members. 



All which is respectfully submitted by 



Hall of the Academy, December 26th, 1843. 



W. S. Zantzinger, 

 Recording Secretary. 



The Report of the Treasurer was read, and referred, as 

 usual, to the Auditors for examination. 



NEW BUSINESS. 



Professor Johnson offered the following resolutions, which 

 were unanimously adopted : 



Resolved, That the extended and valuable Report of the 

 Recording Secretary, presented this evening, contains the 

 most gratifying evidences of the prosperity of this Institution, 

 and of the assiduous devotion of the Secretary to his various 

 duties. 



Resolved, That the thanks of the Society be presented to 

 the Recording Secretary for his labour in preparing this Re- 

 port, and that the same be referred to the Committee on the 

 Proceedings for publication. 



Mr. Phillips offered the following resolution, which was 

 also unanimously adopted : 



Resolved, That the thanks of this Society be presented to 

 Mr. George W. Carpenter, for the ample and gratifying re- 

 port of the financial concerns of the Institution presented this 

 evening, and for his assiduous and successful attention to the 

 trust confided in him. 



The Society then proceeded to an election for Officers for 

 the ensuing year. The tellers appointed by the chairman 

 announced the following result:
