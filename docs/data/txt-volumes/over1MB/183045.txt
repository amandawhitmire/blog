PROCEEDINGS 
OF THE 
ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES 
OF PHILADELPHIA. 
1858. 
January 5, 1858. 
Dr. Ruschenberger, in the Chair. 
Thirty-two members present. 
Mr. Slack presented for publication in the Proceedings a paper en- 
titled Catalogue and Notes on the Egyptian Antiquities in the collec- 
tion of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, by J. H. 
Slack/' which was referred to a committee. 
Dr. Uhler exhibited a specimen of nitre which had occurred sponta- 
taneously in large quantity, upon the wall of a dwelling formerly 
used as a stable. It was remarkable for its purity, being free from 
lime, ammonia, magnesia and nitrate of soda. 
Mr. Cassin called attention to the specimen of Falco polyagrtrs, pre- 
sented this evening by Mr. J. D. Sergeant, who had obtained it east of 
the Mississippi. Mr. Cassin had described the species from a specimen 
brought from Oregon by Mr. Townsend, but the present specimen was 
the first he had known to be found east of the Rocky Mountains. 
January 12th. 
Vice-President Lea in the Chair. 
Thirty-four members present. 
Dr. Leidy exhibited two plates of Urnatella gracilis, formerly described by him 
in the Proceedings. He said the stomachs of these animals contained certain 
voluntarily moving bodies which he had supposed to be parasites, but which 
might prove to be generative bodies. Mr. Lea had recently given him a 
Unio from the Scioto, upon which this species of Urnatella had been detected â 
the former specimens were from the Schuylkill. 
Dr. Leidy announced the return from Nebraska Territory of Dr. F. V. Hayden, 
bringing an important collection of fossils, among which were a number of 
mammalian remains from a supposed pliocene deposit, of the Niobrara River, 
(L'eau-qui-court.) 
January l^th. 
Yice-President Bridges in the Chair. 
Forty-three members present.

^ PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to some remains of a Camel 
in the collection recently obtained by Dr. Hayden, from the Niobrara River, 
Nebraska. He exhibited the back portion of the lower jaw of the animal, 
which contains the true molar teeth, and possesses a hook-like process on the 
posterior border, as in the recent Camel ; in comparison with which the ex- 
tinct species appears to have been about two-third sthe size. He also exhibited, 
from the same collection, the fragment of a lower jaw of a species of Wolf, 
larger than any heretofore described. 
Dr. Uhler exhibited specimens of crystallized lead, produced by withdrawing 
the fused interior of a cooling mass. The crystals were arranged upon rhombic 
bases. He also exhibited specimens of apparently fibrous or columnar lead, pro- 
duced by exposing a mass when on the point of fusion, to a sudden shock. He 
had failed to develop any appearance of fibrous or crystalline structure upon the 
sawn end of a specimen by etching. 
Prof. Booth remarked the resemblance of the crystals to the skeleton cha- 
racter seen in gold, from California and Australia. He thought the fibrous or 
columnar appearance not attributable to crystallization, the sides being of 
variable number, but due merely to cooling, or similar causes. He had ob- 
served a structure resembling this in pigs of Lake Superior copper, in nickel 
commercially pure, and in an alloy of nickel and copper. 
Mr. Aubrey H. Smith, referring to some figures from Siam, presented by him 
this evening, said the stone head was from the ruined city of Juthia; the bronze 
figure, apparently ancient, presented still existing characteristics of the people. 
January l^tli, 
Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 
Forty-five memlbers present. 
Dr. Ruschenberger read the following : â 
Hall of the Academy, January 26th, 1858. 
Report of the Committee of the Academy^ appointed to confer with a committee of the 
Biological Society^ on a proposed junction of the two Societies. 
Your Committee " appointed to confer with the Committee of the Biological 
Society of Philadelphia, with respect to the union of labors proposed in the 
letter of said Committee, and to report to the Academy the terms of the pro- 
posal, and also the reasons which shall appear to the Committee for or against 
such union," has frequently met the Committee of the Biological Society of 
Philadelphia, and, after free and full discussion of all the points involved, re- 
ports as follows : 
The third section of the Charter of the Academy provides, that " the Society 
shall consist of members and correspondents," and indicates that they shall be 
elected individually, each being balloted for, separately. The practice of the 
Society since its institution in the year 1812 has been in conformity to this 
provision. 
For this reason your Committee is of opinion that the Academy cannot, 
consistently with the spirit if not the letter of its Charter and By-Laws, accept 
any terms of union with the Biological Society, or annex any other society, or 
absorb any other body of men associated for analogous or identical objects, 
whatever might be the advantages of such union. 
Your Committee might, under a literal construction of the resolution by 
which it was created, properly conclude this report with a recommendation 
that the proposition to unite the two societies be rejected. But sensible of the 
meritorious objects of the Biological Society, it begs the indulgence of the 
[Jan. 

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA.

Academy to submit briefly its views in connection with the subject, and to 
ask the adoption of a measure in relation to it, which, it is hoped, will be 
entirely acceptable to a large majority of members of both institutions. 
In the language of its Charter, the Academy was instituted " for the en- 
couragement and cultivation of the Sciences," and is " devoted entirely to the 
advancement of useful learning." 
Nearly a half century has passed since its institution. Daring nearly all of 
this period, the cultivation of the natural sciences has been pursued objectively. 
It has been limited almost exclusively to the investigation of specific differ- 
ences and resemblances of forms, with a view to portraying those which are new 
and distinguishing them from those previously described, for the purpose 
of appropriately classing them. The field of cultivation includes the geographi- 
cal distribution of the fauna and flora of the earth, whether living or fossil; 
and the habits, habitat and uses of the various organisms, as well as the 
regular and irregular forms and chemical composition of inorganic matter. 
The results of the labors of the members of the Academy in this wide field, 
are recorded in its Proceedings and Journals. 
But with the lapse of time and advancement of knowledge new fields of in- 
quiry have been opened. To study natural sciences objectively only, no longer 
satisfies the disposition of man to pry into the secrets of creation. He now 
anxiously seeks to discover and expose the laws of organic life. He earn- 
estly desires to distinguish primary organic cells, and to ascertain the forces 
and laws which bring them together, and combine them in aggregate exist- 
ences, from the lowest microscopic infusoria up through the zoophytes and 
acalephs to the most perfect form of organization. He labors industriously to 
recognize the normal as well as the abnormal conditions of organic structures, 
wherever met on the face of the earth. 
The task is Herculean, and to accomplish it in any degree worthy of considera- 
tion, the laborer requires all the sympathy and facilities which only those inter- 
ested in kindred pursuits know how to accord. He needs the encouragement 
which flows from association with congenial spirits. He needs must be free 
from the disturbing influences of those who cannot or will not appreciate the 
objects of his researches. Such motives induce him to seek fellowship and 
alliance with those who are animated by a zeal analogous to his own. Hence 
it is that many members of the Academy, regarding objective natural history, 
only as the basis of the pyramid of natural science, have been drawn together; 
they have joined others entertaining like views, who are not in fellowship with 
this institution, and organized the Biological Society of Philadelphia, which is 
yet in its earliest infancy. Its chief property consists in the acquirements and 
industry and scientific zeal of its members ; qualities which we should seek to 
retain and accumulate within the walls of this Institution. 
The extensive library, and collections which are daily augmenting, are of 
inestimable value in facilitating the pursuits of the biologist. The Academy 
is pledged to assist " the advancement of useful learning" in all the depart- 
ments of the natural sciences. 
For the reasons alluded to, your Committee has labored assiduously to de- 
vise a measure consistent with the Charter and increasing prosperity of the 
Academy, which shall place all the facilities in its possession within the- easy 
reach not only of those devoted especially to biology, but also of those- who 
may hereafter dedicate their time and labors, particularly, to other branches, 
and at the same time bind together by bonds of common interest, in one har- 
monious union, all who are interested either partially or generally in the culti- 
vation of the natural sciences. 
For this purpose, and to meet the demands which labor is daily making for 
division and subdivision, in every branch of human pursuit, your Committee 
respectfully urges the addition of a chapter to the By-Laws, which shaH pro- 
vide for the creation and government of Classes or Departments, composed of 
members, with authority to hold meetings separately from the common meetings 
of the Institution, and with all the privileges necessary for the successful prosecu- 
1858.]

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
tion of their studies ; but at the same time entirely subordinate to its Charter 
and By-Laws. 
Under a belief that pure scientific zeal is never pretentious, and to avoid the 
confusion which might possibly arise from identity of appellations of different 
officers in the same organization, names and titles for the officers of the depart- 
ments proposed have been selected with a view to practical, rather than to 
merely honorary distinction, which titles should be clearly indicative of sub- 
ordination. 
Your Committee has never been unmindful of the interests of the Academy, 
nor of the grave influence which the measure now recommended is calculated 
to exert on the prosperity of the Academy ; which is regarded to be inseparable 
from the advancement of science. After patiently viewing the subject in all 
its various aspects, it is sincerely believed that only good can accrue from 
amending the By-Laws as proposed. But, even should experience prove that 
expectation has been disappointed, the Academy may be brought back to its 
present organization, by repealing the By-Laws which it is now solicited to 
enact. 
The provisions herewith submitted, it is supposed, will meet all the practical 
wants of scientific men devoted to the cultivation of special departments of 
natural history, and in this way remove every necessity for forming new so- 
cieties, and in a great degree, if not entirely, annul the allurements which may 
be held out to members of the Academy, to labor under the fostering care of 
newly established organizations. 
It is designed that the proceedings of the Departments shall be laid before 
the Academy at every meeting for business, in order that the results of their 
investigation may be communicated to each other, and particular information 
acquired by one may be made common to all. Natural history is not to be 
abandoned, because biologists prefer to investigate the laws of genesis and 
vitality, and physicists delight to examine the properties, the influences and 
motions of the atmosphere and of inorganic matter. The fields of entomology, 
ornithology, mammalogy, &c., are neither invaded nor diminished by the con-

No. 31. Shawl of fine linen, such as were used tO envelope the mummies of 
the higher classes of Egyptians, from Thebes. J. H. Slack. There has been 
lately discovered at Thebes an undertaker's shop, situated among the tombs on 
the western side of the Nile, containing over a thousand shawls, such as were 
used to envelope the dead, each having the price marked in one corner appa-

turning on pins and secured by bolts and bars, or a lock ; which last was pro- 
tected by a seal of clay, upon which the impress of a signet was impressed 
when the party retired. Remains of the clay seal have even been found adher-

Dr. Leidy made some further general remarks upon the fossil mammalia ob- 
tained by Dr. Hayden from the Niobrara river (L'eau-qui-court), duringthe re- 
cent expedition of Lieut. G. K. Warren to explore the Black Hills of Nebraska. 
Dr. Hayden suspects the formation in which he discovered the fossils to be of 
pliocene age. The specimens belong to some twenty or more species of ani- 
mals, all of which are distinct from those found in the miocene deposit of the 
Mauvaises Terres ; and are also distinct from those of a subsequent age. The 
forms are, moreover, of more recent character than those of the Mauvaises Terres 
deposit. An interesting and remarkable fact, in connection with these remains, 
is that they indicate a fauna more nearly like the recent fauna of the old world, 
than of this country. Thus, among the remains, are those of a species of Rhino- 
ceros, almost the same size, and having the same dental formula as the ^. indicus 
There are remains of several species of Horse, and of several new genera of 
ruminants ; among which are those of a genus allied to the Musks, and also those 
of a genus closely allied to the Camel. There are, further, remains of a Porcu- 
pine, resembling the genus Hystrix, and those of a small species of Beaver. The 
collection likewise contains remains of three species of Wolf, the lower jaw of 
the feline genus Pseudalurus^ fragments of several other carnivorous genera, and 
portions of the skeleton of the Mastodon and Elephant, 
Dr. LeConte said that while he was recently in Honduras, he had examined 
the Mastodon bed at the village of Tambla, in one of the passes leading from the 
plain of Comayagua to the Pacific. He was satisfied of the identity of the re- 
mains with ilf. giganteus. He had found there a molar of Bos and two or three 
teeth of Equus. 
On motion of Dr. Leidy, by special resolution, the thanks of the 
Academy were presented to Mrs. R. Pierpont, for the donation of a valu- 
able collection of shells.

Dr. Isaac Hays in the Chair. 
Thirty-three members present. 
Dr. Leidy made some further general remarks upon the pliocene fossils from Ne- 
braska ; he exhibited many bones, among them the foot of a horse. He ob- 
served, that among all the mammalian remains brought by Dr. Hayden from the 
Niobrara river, none were more remarkable than those which he now exhibited. 
They belong to an equine animal which has the temporary teeth of Anchitherium, 
and the permanent teeth of Equus. In both these genera, the permanent and de- 
ciduous teeth are alike, but the new genus in early life is an Anchitherium, and 
later in life a true Horse. 
He also exhibited the jaws, with the teeth, of a new genus allied to Oreodon, 
partaking, like this, of suiline and ruminant characters. The specimens were 
discovered by Dr. Hayden on the Niobrara, opposite Fort Laramie, and indicate 
a larger animal than any of the species of Oreodon described by him.

Thirty-nine members present. 
Mr. Ashmead called the attention of members to a Marine Alga which he 
had discovered about three years since at Beesley's Point. From the micro- 
scopic structure of the frond, he supposed it to be a Callithamnion, and not 
finding it described in Nereis Boreali- Americana, he concluded it was a new spe- 
cies. He had referred it to the late Prof. Bailey, of West Point, who returned 
it with the remark, " I cannot make this agree with any Callithamnion known 
to me ; if it were truly dichotomous, I should refer it to Griffithsia setacea^ but 
without its fruit I cannot decide what it is. It is an interesting plant, and 
ought to be watched for, at different times in the year, so as to secure its fruit." 
During the past summer, I collected, at Beesley's Point, quite a number of 
specimens of this plant ; I found them growing in shallow water, attached to 
old shells and other submerged substances ; but I found none in fruit. Upon 
the examination of a number of specimens, I formed the conclusion that the 
plant belongs to the genus Griffithsia, and is a new species. Under this impres- 
sion, I sent specimens to Prof. Harvey, of Trinity College, Dublin, for examina- 
tion. I recently received a letter from that distinguished Algologist, and though 
not with a view to publication, I presume an extract may be presented without 
impropriety. Dr. Harvey says : " The supposed new Griffithsia, sent in one of 
your parcels, is Griffithsia tenuis^ J. Ag., identical with the specimens in my her- 
barium, from Agardh himself. The American plant is a little stronger in growth 
than the European, but I see no character to separate it. The fruit is unknown. 
Your specimens are not in fruit. The genus to which it belongs is therefore 
doubtful ; and I am therefore disposed to think that it will turn out to be a 
Callithamnion â an opinion I arrived at, because it is very closely allied to Calli- 
thamnion thysigerum^ of Australia and Ceylon, the fruit of which is known to 
me. Indeed, it is possible that Callithamnion thysigerum itself may be only a 
variety of Griffithsia tenuis.'' This alga is interesting as an addition to the 
marine flora of the American coast. 
Mr. Lesley described a curious reverse drainage of the uplands bordering the 
Ohio river on each side, near Ironton, and within the limits of the coal region of 
southern Ohio and Kentucky. On climbing the river cliffs about 300 feet, the 
summit is found to be formed by a stratum of conglomerate about fifty feet thick, 
and one looks over into bowl-shaped heads of small valleys, delivering their 
waters backward, and only reaching the river by circuits more or less extensive. 
These valley heads*are so close to the great river valley, that short tunnels driven 
along in the almost horizontal coal-beds would suffice to bring out the ores which 
crop around them. The barriers are lofty knife edges or thin walls, or strips of 
horizontal conglomerate, the place of which in the coal measures is about 500 
feet from the bottom. The dip of the strata is only about thirty feet to the mile, 
and contrary to the current of the river. It would be difficult, he thought, to 
explain this structure by the popular theories of denudation, or any bypothethis, 
unless subaerial deluges. 
Mr. Powel protested against the too constant recourse to immediate volcanic 
agency in explaining geological phenomena. In the Pottsville region the strata 
were often folded and contorted by side pressure from various causes, with no 
close or immediate local evidence of volcanic agency, it being often seen only far 
off. The structure of the Ohio valley now mentioned, might have occurred ori- 
ginally as a mere crack in the conglomerate, perhaps caused by a very trifling 
local upheaval, or a slight shrinkage, or even a subsidence at a distance, this 
would determine the original line of drainage, and attrition might, in time, pro- 
duce such a valley as Mr. Lesley had described. 
[Feb. 

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA.

Mr. Lesley thought the valley could not have suffered from volcanic force, for 
it was tortuous like the suture of a skull, not straight like the profound lines of 
fault in the Appalachians of Pennsylvania, Virginia and Tennessee." 
Mr. Foulke described the Deep River country as one of straight valleys wailed 
in by vertical cliffs two or three hundred feet high, which he thought were evi- 
dently fractures of the crust. 
Mr. Lesley described the Kanawha country to show that, if so, then the crust 
must be looked upon as having suffered a shivering rupture with open and pro- 
found cracks running irregularly or aborescently. But such fissures could not 
have been filled up, and their sides sloped off to form a country like western 
Virginia. 
Dr. Woodhouse described the canons of the Pacific side, as sometimes sedi- 
mentary on one side, and volcanic or metamorphic on the other, and sometimes 
having lava streams in the middle.

Dr. Leidy read a letter from Mr. F. B. Meek and Dr. F. V. Hayden, 
dated Albany, Feb. 16th, 1858, indicating the probable existence of 
Permian Rocks in Kansas Territory, from which, at the request of 
the authors, the following extract is published. 
" Some six months since, Major F, Hawn, of Weston, Missouri, to whom we are 
under many obligations for interesting information respecting the geology of 
Kansas Territory, sent on to one of us'^ a small collection of fossils from a 
locality near the junction of Solomon's and Smoky Hill forks of Kansas River. A 
portion of these fossils were at once recognized as being types common in the 
coal measures of the west. Along with these, however, there were several masses

of a yellowish magaesian limestone containing numerous casts of a very peculiar 
group of fossils. On examining these, it was soon observed that they are quite 
unlike any forms known to us in the carboniferous system, and very nearly allied 
to types considered characteristic of the Permian, of the old world. Major Hawn 
was at once apprised of this fact, and he has since informed us of several facts 
in relation to this formation, which rather go to confirm the view that it may 
prove to be of Permian age, rather than otherwise. In the first place, he informs 
us that the bed from which the fossils were obtained, hold a position, above the 
well marked coal measures, and seems to have been deposited upon an uneven 
surface, as though the coal measures had been worn into hills and valleys previous 
to the deposition of the rock of which we speak." [Signed, Meek and Hayden.] 
Dr. Leidy directed the attention of the members to some fossils on the table, 
being part of the collection obtained by Dr. F. V. Hayden, in the valley of the 
Niobrara river, Nebraska. One of the specimens was the lower jaw of a new 
species of Mastodon. It belonged to an old individual, as the last molar tooth 
occupies its functional position and is considerably worn. The jaw indicates a 
smaller animal than the common Mastodon (J/. Ohioiicus.) The tooth resembles 
the corresponding one of M. sivalensis, or of 31. anffusiidens, much more nearly 
than that of the common Mastodon. The crown has a much greater antero- 
posterior diameter in relation to its transverse diameter, than in the latter, and 
it has six transverse rows of tubercles, together with a feeble tarsus. The tuber- 
cles are crowded instead of being separated by wide angular valleys as in the 
common Mastodon. The tooth was compared with that from an unknown 
locality, characterized by Dr. Hays under the name of 31. Chapmani; but this 
more nearly resembles the South American species M. Hurnboldti. In advance 
of the tooth, there are no traces of an alveolus for the preceding tooth, but a 
sharp ridge proceeds from the last molar to the anterior extremity of the jaw. 
Dr. Leidy observed he had never seen the jaw of the common Mastodon in the 
same condition, as the oldest individuals always presented the fifth alveolus 
filled up, and not completely obliterated. The species he named llastodon min- 
ficiLS. 
Dr. Leidy next exhibited part of an upper molar tooth of an Elephant from 
the Niobrara ; which he suspected to be a species distinct from those previously 
indicated, though it does not present sufficient characters to establish the opin- 
ion. It is the broadest tooth he had ever seen, being almost five inches, and it 
has fewer plates of enamel than in any variety of teeth of Elcphas Americanus 
that had come under his inspection. The species he proposed to distinguish by 
the name Elephas imperator. 
Dr. Hays called attention to the fact that the tooth of the new Mastodon had 
protruded more obliquely forward and upward than in the common species, indi- 
cating a nearer alliance to the Elephant. 
Dr. Leidy thought Dr. Hays quite correct, and that the last molar in protruding 
forward and upward had gradually displaced two preceding teeth, whose posi- 
tion it now occupied. He then described the mode of development and succes- 
sion of the teeth in the Elephant ; and he showed, as observed by Dr. Hays in 
the new Mastodon, that we have a closer approximation to the same process, 
than in the common species. 
On leave granted. Dr. Oamac offered the following special resolution :

" Notice of Remains of Extinct Vertebrata, from the valley of the 
Niobrara River, collected during an expedition under the command of 
Lieut. G. K. Warren, U. S. Topoo;raphical Engineers, to explore the 
region of the Black Hills, by Dr. F. V. Hayden, Geologist to the Ex- 
pedition, by Joseph Leidy, M. D." 
Which were referred to committees. 
Dr. Leidy, in presenting his paper intended for publication in the Proceed- 
ings, observed that it contained characteristic descriptions of twenty-eight spe- 
cies of extinct vertebrates, among which are six carnivora of the canine and 
feline families, iwo rodents, eight ruminants, eight solipeds, three large pachy- 
derms, and one turtle. In relation to the eight solipeds, he stated they belonged 
to six genera : Equus, Hipparion, Protohippus^ Merycliipj)m^ Hypohiprpus^ and 
Parahippus. The two latter constitute with Anchitherium a distinct group ; the 
three former constitute another group ; and the fourth one is an intermediate 
form. The remains of Uquus, indicating one species, are undistinguishable from 
the corresponding parts of the domestic horse. 
Dr. L. further remarked, since he had had the opportunity of inspecting the 
numerous equine remains from the Niobrara, he was inclined to believe that the 
remains of the horse found in the post-pliocene deposits of the United States, 
indicate two speeies. Of these the remains of one are undistinguishable from 
corresponding parts of the recent horse, and are the representative of the E. pri- 
migenius of Europe, and may be distinguished by the name of E. fraternus. The 
other species relates to the E. pliddens of Europe, and like it is characterized by 
the comparatively complex arrangement of the enamel folding in the upper 
molar teeth. He had formerly named it E. americanus^ but as this name 
had been previously applied to a South American species, he would now propose 
for it that of E. compUcatus. The equine remains referred to, together with those 
of a small species of Hipparion from the post pliocene deposit near Charleston, 
S. â C., and those of a species of Anchitherium from the miocene deposit of the 
Mauvaises Terres, Nebraska, appear to indicate the former existence of twelve 
species of seven genera of the family of solipeds in this country. From these 
facts it would appear as if the equine family was becoming extinct, as it is now 
represented by the sole genus Equus. 
Dr. Hammond said the sections of jet he presented this evening were from a 
vein eighteen inches in thickness, at Oevolleta. Under the microscope they 
exhibited the woody structure very beautifully. 
Mr. Lesley exhibited fragments of conglomerate, from under the coal, from the 
top of Blossburg Mountain, showing apparently the impression of a Calamite, 
which seemed to have marked or moulded even the pebbles themselves. 
Mr. Lea was inclined to ascribe the marks upon the fragments exhibited, rather 
to the groving or scratching of one rock by another after fracture, as seen in the 
slickensides. 
Mr. Lesley had examined the locality for scratches, but bad found no s^^ch fissure 
as that suggested by Mr. Lea, besides the beds at the spot are nearly horizontal ,

Dr. Leidj called the attention of the members to a cast of a Mastodon tooth 
from the collection of Dr. Harlan, which collection had for many years been 
stowed away in a ware-house in this city, and had recently been presented to 
the Academy by the son of Dr. Harlan. The cast is labelled in the hand-writing 
of the Id^iiQv^ Mastodon longirostris WiocQxiQ^ Maryland." The original speci- 
men is said to have been found in a miocene deposit, near Greensburgh, Caroline 
county, Md. For some time it was in the possession of Dr. Ducatel, of Balti- 
more, and subsequently was deposited in the Museum of that city, Mr. Charles- 
worth, Sir Charles Lyell, Dr. Harlan and Dr. Hays, who had seen the specimen, 
considered it as having belonged to the M. longirostris or if. augustidens. When 
Dr. Warren was preparing his book on the american Mastodon, he was desirous 
of inspecting this tooth, but learned that it was lost. Subsequently, a tooth, in 
the cabinet of the Academy, which had been purchased in London as an ameri- 
can fossil, was suspected to be the missing Baltimore specimen, and as such is 
described and figured in Dr. Warren's work, (The Mastodon giganteus of North 
America, p. 92, pi. xxvi.) This tooth, now on the table, by comparison with the 
cast, proves not to be the so-called Baltimore tooth, though approaching it in a 
remarkable manner, in size, general form, and in being fractured at the anterior 
extremity. 
Dr. Leidy next exhibited a tooth from the collection of Dr. Harlan, which Dr. 
Hays says is the original specimen on which the Tapirus masiodontoides was 
founded. The specimen corresponds in size and form very nearly with the 
description given by Dr. Harlan in his account of T. masiodontoides (Fauna 
Americana, p. 224 ; Medical and Physical Researches, p. 265.) Dr. L. added, 
he confirmed the views of Mr. Cooper (American Monthly Journal of Geology, 
p. 163,) and Dr. Hays, that the specimen was a first milk molar of the Mastodon.

can Association for the advancement of Science, extended to all the 
members of the Academy, an invitation to be present at the next meet- 
ing about to be held in Baltimore, to which he added the promise of 
the cordial hospitality of the citizens. 
The following papers were presented for publication in the Proceed- 
ings : 
Descriptions of a New Helix and two new Planorbes, by Isaac Lea." 
Descriptions of eight new species of Unio, by Isaac Lea.''

Mr. Lea remarked, that he had received from Dr. Hayden, so well known for 
his interesting discoveries of the fossil Fauna, of Nebraska Territory, &c., all 
the fresh water molluscs which he had procured during his journey into those 
distant and little known Indian countries. Mr. R. Kennicott, a young and ardent 
student of Natural History, whose letter Mr. Lea read, had also submitted to him a 
collection of molluscs made by him for the Northwestern University of Evanston, 
Illinois, from a part of North America rarely visited by the investigator of Nat- 
ural History, the Red River of the North, which having its source near the head 
waters of the Mississippi, runs due north into Lake Winnepeg, which Lake dis- 
charges its waters through Nelson's River into Hudson's Bay. 
It is not to be understood that either of these collections, made under many 
adverse circumstances, and at times, of great personal danger, should be full 
representations of this branch of the Fauna of these countries. But they are 
sufficient to prove that zoological life, so far as represented by IIoUuscs, is nearly, 
if not quite the same, as that of the Ohio River Basin, as well as that of the 
Missouri River, and a part of that of the Lower Mississippi and Red River of the 
South. The knowledge of a part of the species from these remote districts, 
proves to us the wide-spread distribution of the same species, as we find evenr 
one of them in the Ohio River at Cincinnati, Marietta and Pittsburg, and this is 
the more remarkable, as the waters of the Red River of the North are embraced 
in a different system of drainage, flowing as they do into Hudson's Bay at about 
52Â° North lat. Thus is seen an immense area of country producing in its waters 
nearly the same life, as regards the Molluscs ; a fact highly interesting to the 
Zoologist. 
The following species were brought by Dr. Hayden from the mouths of the 
Rivers Big Sioux and James' River, 43Â° north, and 9*7Â° west, 
Unio asperrimus, Lea. U. elegans. Lea. U. alatus. Say. U. lacrimosus. Lea. 
U. laevissimus. Lea. U. luteolus. Lam. U. rectus. Lam. U. anodoiitoides, Lea. 
Margaritana complanata. Lea. 
And from the Upper Missouri at Fort Clark, Unio luteolus, Lam., and Margari- 
tana complanata. Lea. 
From the Red River of the North, 50Â° north, Mr. Kennicott procured the fol- 
lowing : 
Unio asperrimus. Lea. U. alatus, Say. U. luteolus, Lam. U. rectus, Lam, 
U. rubiginosus. Lea. U. occidens. Lea. U. undulatus, Bar. Anodonta Ferus- 
saciana, Lea. A. decora, Lea. 
Every species from these two habitats is found in the vicinity of Cincinnati, 
and several of them, viz : Unio asperrimus, anodoiitoides, rubiginosus, and Ano- 
donta Ferussaciana are found in the waters of Louisiana. Even in Georgia there 
are two of them, viz : Unio anodontoides and Unio alatus. 
Mr. Lea did not wish to be understood that he believed all the species of the 
Unionidce, which were common in one part of this great area, were the same which 
inhabited the waters of other parts. On the contrary, they differed much in the 
lower Mississippi, but still there are some species which are common in the 
Ohio, as high up as Pittsburg, which are found in Moose River, of Hudson's Bay, 
52Â° North, in Red River of the north, 50Â° North, in Upper Missouri, 4YÂ° North, 
and in the Big Sioux, 43Â° North. There are also some others which are com- 
mon at Pittsburg, which are found as far south as Louisiana, 30Â° North, and in 
Georgia, 34Â° North. 
These facts Mr. Lea believed to be important in regard to the geographical 
distribution of the species, some of which are found to bo so extensively dis- 
tributed, while it is well known that some few are restricted, so far as our present 
knowledge extends, to points embraced within very short distances in a single 
river. As an illustration of this, the Unio spinosus, Unio Shepardianusy Margari- 
tana arculn, &c., may be cited.

Dr. Leicly read the following letter : 
Saint Louis, March 16, 1858. 
My Dfar Sir,â I have the pleasure of announcing to you, that I have just 
completed an examination of some fossils, collected by Dr. G. S. Shumard from 
the White Limestone of the Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico, while he was 
connected with the expedition of Capt. John Page, and I am fully convinced that 
these fossils are Permian, The collection contains about forty species, a number 
of which are identical with species of the Permian system of Russia and England. 
We have specimens which agree perfectly with Verneuil's descriptions and 
figures of Camaraphoria Schlotheimi and C. Geinitziana from the Permian System 
of Russia. We have also an Aulosteges which^resembles A. Wangenheimi (Ver- 
neuil,) though it is doubtless a distinct species. This genus has not, I believe, 
been found lower than the Permian. 
The Procluctus Leplayi'iQ represented, and there is another Productus which is 
very analogous to P. cancrini, (Vern.) The Spirigera pectinifera, (Vern. sp.) 
Terehratula svpcrstes, (Verneuil,) Spirifer cristata and S. permiana, of King, are 
undoubtedly in our collection, and also Acanthocladia anceps, (King) and Syno- 
cladia virgulacea, (King,) all of which are species of the Permian of Russia and 
England. Besides, there is a Monotis which resembles 31. speluncaria. We also 
recognized several species that are in Professor Swallow's collection from the 
Permian Rocks of Kansas. According to measurements made by my brother, 
these Permian Rocks attain a thickness of more than a thousand feet in the 
Guadalupe Mountains. The rock is a remarkably pure white limestone, and 
portions of the mass abounds in fossils. It is underlaid by sandstones and lime- 
stones of the coal measures, containing the same fossils as characterized this 
formation in Missouri, Iowa and Illinois, but in New Mexico scarcely a single 
species ranges from the Coal Measures into the Permian. 
I am now engaged in preparing descriptions of the new Permian Fossils. Will 
you be kind enough to announce this discovery at the next meeting of the 
Philadelphia Academy. Sincerely yours, 
B. F. Shumard. 
Mr, Lesley exhibited a specimen of lignite from the Upper Wachita 
River, Louisiana, received through Mr. Perry, of New Orleans. It is 
remarkable for containing rosin in quite visible masses. Sometimes the

rosin is found in masses as large as a nut, sometimes in veins. It is 
from a tertiary formation. 
Mr. Lea has a specimen of rosin which Sir Henry De La Beche had

Remarks on an Optical Illusion. 
BY ALEXANDER WILCOCKS, M. D. 
I desire to draw the attention of the Academy to one of the phenomena oi 
sight, which is interesting, because I conceive that it has led some zealous in- 
vestigators of the mysteries of nature into error. 
I allude to that power of the retina, by which an impression made upon it by 
a luminous object is retained, during an appreciable time. 
The most familiar illustration of this law, is in the whirling of a piece ot 
lighted charcoal in the dark. The result is the formation of a luminous ring, 
more or less perfect, according to the rapidity of the motion of the hand. 
Experience has not only abundantly proved the existence of this peculiarity 
of the retina ; but it has also determined the duration of the impressions. It has 
been found to be from one tenth, to one eighth of a second. 
Such at least is true of persons in good health ; but there is reason to believe 
that there are cases where the duration of impressions is much longer. 
If when under suitable circumstances, a luminous body is moved before the 
eye at rest, we perceive a line of light, we may naturally expect, that when the 
converse condition obtains, we shall witness a similar phenomenon. 
By the converse condition, I mean that wherein the luminous object is at rest, 
and the eye in motion about one of its own axes. 
Requirements so simple are easily obtained ; the most convenient object 
upon which to make the experiment is the star Sirius. The precautions to be 
observed, are to choose a time when the moon does not shine, and the star is 
high above the horizon ; and a place where the eye will not be dazzled by any 
artificial light. The observer must be free from all sense of fatigue, because the 
eye sympathizes readily with the condition of the body, and any cause that in- 
terferes with the rapidity of the motions of the organ, would endanger the 
success of the experiment. 
Experiment 1st. Let the observer turn his face toward the star, but fix his 
eyes upon a point about ten degrees to the east of that object, then suddenly 
placing his eyes upon the star, he will perceive a ray or flash of light reaching 
from the star to a point ten degrees to the west. 
Experiment 2nd. Keeping his eyes for a moment upon the star, let the ob- 
server return them to their first position, and he will perceive that the flash ot 
light will extend from the star to that position. 
Any one who will trace in his mind the course pursued by the image of the 
star upon the retinae, during this motion of the eyes, will ascertain that these 
results are precisely what d, priori reasoning should lead us to expect. 
In the experiments just described, the flashes of light are straight. If instead 
of the star Sirius, we choose for our experiment, the planet Jupiter, at a time 
when that body is within twenty-five degrees of the zenith, we shall discover 
that the flashes of light are curved, and the convexity of the curve invariably 
toward the earth. 
It must be noticed in connection with this peculiarity, that any observations 
upon an object at such an altitude as the one proposed, viz. sixty-five degrees, 
would require that the eyes should be much raised above their usual plane of 
motion. The physiologist may find much difficulty in explaining why the eleva- 
tion of the eyes in their orbits should cause the flash of light to be curved ; 
and why the convexity should be toward the earth ; but, that the facts exist, 
others may verify for themselves. 
The particular interest which attaches to this experiment is from the light which 
it throws upon the results of some observations upon meteors, the explanation 
of which has baffled the ingenuity of astronomers. 
In the year 1798, Brandes, of Leipsig and Benzenberg, of Dusseldorf, under- 
took to measure the height and velocities of meteors. Having established a base 
line of 46,200 feet, and provided themselves with chronometers, they stationed 
1858.] 

20 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY 01* 
themselves at the ends of the line, and watched for meteors, carefully noting the 
times of their appearance, and their couraes. By these means, the observers 
were enabled to identify twenty- two of these objects ; and the data thus derived, 
yielded satisfactory results as to height and velocity. 
The most remarkable feature of their observations, was, that one of the meteors 
instead of falling, moved in a direction aioay from the earth. 
A curv^e in the train of a meteor with the convexity downward, would indi- 
cate a motion from the earth. 
Nearly all the phenomena of meteors have been accounted for by theories 
which men of science regard, if not as satisfactory, at least as plausible ; but I 
believc/no astronomer has yet had the hardihood to attempt to explain, how a 
meteor can approach near enough to our planet to be inflamed by its atmosphere, 
and become visible to its inhabitants, and then move off in defiance of the law 
of gravitation. 
I have detailed experiments which show that stationary objects in the heavens, 
under certain circumstances, appear associated with flashes of light which are 
curved with their convexity towards the earth ; and I trust that what I have 
said will convince the Academy that there is the greatest probability that the 
anomalous appearance described by Messrs. Brandes and Benzenberg, was only 
an example of the optical illusion which it is the purpose of this paper to explain. 
Notice of Remains of Extinct Vertebrata, from the Valley of the Niobrara River, 
collected during the Exploring Expedition of 1867, in Nebraska, under the 
command of Lieut. G. K. Warren, TJ. S. Top. Eng., by Dr. F. V. Hayden, Geolo- 
gist to the Expedition.* 
BY JOSEPH LEIDY, M. D. 
During the Exploring Expedition of the last year in Nebraska, under the 
command of Lieut. Gl. K. Warren, the Greologist of the Expedition, Dr. F. V. 
Hayden collected a number of remains of mammals and turtles, from a deposit, 
in the valley of the Niobrara River (Swift-running-water ; L'eau-qui-court), 
which he suspects to be of pliocene age. The collection is an exceedingly in- 
teresting and important one ; and the anatomical characters of the specimens 
support the opinion of their discoverer, that the formation, from which they 
were obtained, belongs to the later tertiary period. 
The extinct fauna of the Niobrara is especially rich in remains of ruminating 
and equine animals. Among the former are several peculiar genera, of which 
two are closely allied to Oreodon and Leptauchenia, of the miocene deposit of 
the Mauvaises Terres : one is allied to the Musk-deer, and another closely ap- 
proaches the Camel. Besides the remains of a true species of Equus, the col-

lection contains those of two species of Hipparion, and several peculiar genera 
of the equine family. There are also remains of several species of canine and 
feline animals, of a small species of Beaver, and of a species of Porcupine 
more nearly allied to that of the old world than to our own recent one. The col- 
lection further contains remains of a Rhinoceros, resembling that of India, 
those of a new species of Mastodon, and those of a large Elephant. 
One of the most remarkable circumstances, in relation with this extinct 
fauna, is that it is more nearly allied to the present recent one of the old world 
than to that of our own continent. From a comparison of our recent fauna 
and flora with that of the eastern continent, the deduction has been made, that 
the western continent is the older of the two, geologically speaking, whereas, 
the Niobrara fauna would indicate just the reverse relationship of age. A num- 
ber of similar instances show that totally different faunae and florae may be 
cotemporaneous, and do not necessarily indicate different periods of existence.

Since the preceding descriptions of wolves were written. Dr. Hayden has 
sent to me for examination a specimen belonging to the Niobrara collection, 
consisting of a much mutilated fragment of a lower jaw of a huge wolf. 
The fragment contains the sectorial molar, the two preceding premolars, and 
the sockets for the tubercular molars. The teeth preserved in the specimen 
are much worn, indicating an old individual, but they have the form of the 
corresponding teeth in the recent Wolf. The tubercular molars have occupied 
more than an inch of space, though more crowded in position than in recent 
wolves. The last, as well as the first, was inserted by widely separated fangs

that in the middle of the hiatus behind the canine tooth there is a smaller 
socket for a rudimental premolar, as in the extinct Felis (Pseudcelurus) quadri-

The jaw and incisor teeth have the same form as the corresponding part of 
the recent Beaver. The first molars present nearly the same arrangement

their crown ; and they have the enamel folds on the triturating surface

This species of deer is indicated by a fragment of a lower jaw containing the 
posterior four molar teeth, portions of two last inferior molars, a small antler, 
and a small fragment of a second. The form of the teeth is the same as in 
Cervus virgmianus, and their size accords with that in full grown and robust 
individuals of this species. The antler is perhaps that of a young animal. 
The frontal process supporting it is half an inch in length and thickness. A 
little less than an inch above the ring of the antler it divides into two diverg- 
ing prongs, of which one is broken off, and the remaining one is two and a 
quarter inches long.

Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. vii. 90 ; ibid. viii. 89. 
This genus and species were originally proposed on a small fragment of a 
lower jaw of a ruminating animal, belonging to the collection of Prof. Hall, of 
Albany, and discovered by Messrs. Meek and Hay den on Bijou Hill, Nebraska, 
in the summer of 1853. 
The collection from the Niobrara contains the greater ]3ortion of four halves 
of lower jaws, together exhibiting a full series of molar teeth. 
The form of the jaw supporting the teeth is much like that of the Deer, ex- 
cept that its base turns up posteriorly as in the Musks. 
The inferior true molars have much more nearly the form of those of the 
Sheep than of those of the Deer or Musk. The posterior two premolars have 
crowns very much like that of the second premolar of the Deer, and the first 
is like the corresponding one in the same animal.

This genus and species are founded on several fragments of jaws, with teeth 
of several individuals of an animal allied to the Camel, and about two thirds 
its size. 
The posterior fragment of a lower jaw presents the same general form as in 
the corresponding part of the Camel, but is broader at the ramus in relation, 
with its height than in the latter. The posterior coronoid process is well de-

veloped ; and the upper part of tlie ramus is more strongly depressed ex- 
ternally than in the Lama (Auchenia). The body of the lower jaw is relatively 
deeper than in the Camel, though not so robust ; and the two sides are coossi- 
ned by a comparatively short symphysis. 
Six molar teeth form a closed row in the lower jaw, being two additional to 
the number in the Camel and Lama. The true molars and the last premolar 
have nearly the same form as the corresponding teeth of the Camel. The 
second premolar is a reduced one from that behind it ; and the first premolar 
has a laterally compressed ovate crown implanted by two fangs. 
In a small fragment of a lower jaw, in the middle of the hiatus, in advance 
of the closed row of molars, there is the fang of a tooth, which appears to 
have been a caniniform premolar. The mental foramen is just in advance 
and below the position of this tooth. A foramen likewise exists below the 
third premolar of the closed row of teeth, corresponding to that more posteriorly 
situated in the Camel and Lama. 
Two mutilated but connecting fragments of an upper jaw present the hard 
palate more deeply arched than in the Camel or Lama ; and the face narrows 
in advance of the molar teeth as in the latter. A palatine foramen exists 
opposite the interval of the second and third premolars. The infra-orbital 
foramen occupies the same relative position as in the Camel. 
As in the lower jaw, six molar teeth form a closed row in the upper jaw. The 
true molars, though much mutilated in the specimens under examination, 
appear to possess the same form as those of the Camel. The last premolar is 
also like the corresponding tooth of the latter. The second premolar is like 
the first one of the Camel, with the exception that it has the antero-internal 
fold of its crown as well developed as the posterior fold, which it joins at the 
base. The first premolar is like the first one of the series in the Lama, having 
a trilobate, flattened, oval crown.

Megalomeryx niobrarensis, Leidy. 
This genus and species are proposed on two lower molar teeth, in the Nio- 
brara collection, which indicate a ruminating animal of the largest size. One 
of the specimens is apparently a first true molar, and is inserted into a frag- 
ment of the jaw by a pair of strong fangs. The crown is two-thirds worn away, 
and presents the same form as the corresponding tooth of the Sheep in the 
same condition. The antero-postero diameter of the crown is 21 lines ; the 
transverse diameter 11^ lines. 
The second specimen is an isolated, nearly unworn, first or second true 
molar, witli the form nearly the same as in the corresponding teeth of the 
Sheep. Its length is three and one-third inches ; its antero-posterior diameter, 
at the triturating surface, is two inches, and just above the developing fangs 
an inch and a half; the transverse diameter, in the former position, is seven 
lines, and in the latter nine and a half lines.

of a large animal, discovered by Dr. Hayden in the red grit bed of Niobrara, 
near Fort Laramie, Nebraska. The formula of dentition and relative position 
of the teeth with one another are the same as in Oreodon. The true molars 
present a repetition of the form and structure of those of the latter genus, and 
the premolars nearly so. The upper anterior two premolars have a greater 
breadth in relation with their length and thickness than in Oreodon ; and the 
anterior two lower ones are more crowded in position. 
The side of the face turns rather abruptly outward and backward from above 
the position of the true molars, more even than in the Hog, whereas, in the 
three described species of Oreodon^ it slopes gradually backward aud outward, 
more as the Wolf. The infra-orbital foramen is above the interval of the 
first and second true molars, while in Oreodon it is above the third premolar. 
The malar bone below the orbit is, relatively to the size of the animal, deeper 
than in the Hog, but in Oreodon it is not more so than in the Wolf.

Merychyus, Leidy. 
The formula of dentition, and the relative position, structure, and form of 
the teeth are nearly the same as in Lbptauchenia. In this genus, of which 
the remains of two species, L. decora and L. major, were discovered by Dr. 
Hayden in the upper miocene beds of White River, near Eagle Nest Butte, 
Nebraska, the formula of dentition and relative position of the teeth with 
one another are the same as in Oreodon. The crowns of the molars are rela- 
tively much longer, and at their outer part are more vertical than in the latter, 
differing in these respects very much as the molars of the Ox and the Deer. The 
outer lobes of the upper true molars are separated quite to the fangs by narrow, 
deep, vertical folds inclining forward. The inner lobes of the lower true molars 
are separated by narrow, overlapping folds, and present internal plane sur- 
faces, while those of Oreodon are folded as in the Deer. The premolars are 
more crowded than in Oreodon ; and in the case of the upper ones, the most 
elevated point of the triturating surface is much more anterior than in tlie 
latter. The enamel pits of the triturating surfaces of the true molars are very 
narrow in comparison with those of Oreodon, and in the lower teeth are quickly 
obliterated. The canines are relatively small in comparison with those of the 
latter genus. 
In Merychyus, of which there appear to be three species, as indicated by the 
remains discovered by Dr. Hayden in the pliocene deposit of Niobrara, the 
folds separating the outer lobes of the upper true molars have the same form 
as in Leptauchenia, but are not so deep, do not incline forward, and do not 
divide the crown through its base. The lower true molars have their inner 
surfaces as plane as in the Camel, and have their lobes but feebly separated 
in comparison with the condition in Leptauchenia. The canines are as well 
developed as in Oreodon.

Independent of the remains of the anchitherioid genera Parahippus and

of the skeleton of apparently six difi"erent equine animals, which, however, 
exhibit such an interchange of characters, that at present it appears im- 
possible to specify the isolated teeth and bones. The following genera and 
species appear to be indicated by the more characteristic specimens of the col- 
lection. 
Equus excelsus, Leidy. 
This species is about the size of the largest variety of the recent Horse, as 
indicated by molar teeth and bones of the limbs. The teeth do not differ in 
(;onstitution from those of the recent Horse ; and none of them present a greater 
degree of complication of the enamel folds on their triturating surface. 
Equus (Protohippus) perditus, Leidy. 
A second species of Horse, of small size, is especially indicated in the Nio- 
brara collection, by a fragment of an upper jaw containing the posterior four 
molars. The portion of jaw is like the corresponding part in the recent Horse, 
The molar teeth have their crowns about one-fourth worn. The enamel folds 
on the triturating surfaces are even less complex than in the recent Horse, and 
the antero-internal fold or column has the same form, direction and mode of

continuation as the postero-internal one. The space occupied hy the four teeth 
is about three inches in length, and ahout ten lines in breadth. Dr. Hayden's 
collection also contains bones of the limbs which correspond in relative size 
with the jaw and teeth above noticed. 
Figure 1, plate 7, of M. Gervais, Rech. s. 1. Mammiferes Fossiles de I'Amer- 
ique meridionale, apparently represents a species of the same equine subgenus 
as the above. No extent of attrition of the corresponding teeth of the domes- 
tic Horse will produce the same appearance indicated in this figure. 
Merychippus, Leidy. 
This genus is a much more remarkable one than could have been anticipated 
from an examination of the specimen alone from which it was first characterized. 
The specimen alluded to consists of the anterior upper two large molars, con- 
tained in a small fragment of the jaw, and was obtained by Dr. Hay den, at 
Bijou Hill. The two teeth are intermediate in form to the corresponding ones 
of Anchitherium, and the upper true molars of the Deer, and they bear a strong- 
resemblance to those referred above to the anchitherioid genus Parahippus. 
From the teeth of the latter, they differ only in having their intermediate lobes 
prolonged posteriorly past the inner conical lobes, so as to make them assume 
the appearance of the inner lobes of the upper true molars of ruminants. 
In a fragment of the upper jaw of a young animal, in the Niobrara collection, 
apparently belonging to a second species of Merychippus, the second and third 
temporary molars and their permanent successors are contained. The tem- 
porary molars have the same form as the teeth from which the genus was first 
characterized would have, in a more worn condition. They are invested with 
cementum, though in less quantity than is usual in the Horse, and it is more 
readily detached, which appears to have been the case in the two teeth from 
Bijou Hill. The crowns of the permanent teeth contained within the frag- 
ment of jaw under examination have the same form as the corresponding teeth 
of the recent Horse, with the modifications above noticed characterizing the 
subgenus Protohippus. 
Merychippus insignis, Leidy. 
Proc. A. N. S. viii. 311 ; 1857, 89. 
This species was characterized from the fragment of jaw containing what 
now appear to me to be the upper anterior two temporary molars, from Bijou 
Hill. The Niobrara collection contains a portion of the upper jaw, which 
appears to belong to this species, having an entire series of permanent molars, 
(exclusive of the small one,) so far worn as to be inserted by fangs. The series 
of teeth occupy a space of almost four inches in length and ten lines in breadth. 
Merychippus mirabilis, Leidy. 
Appears to be a distinct species from the former, of larger size. It is indicated 
in the Niobrara collection, by a specimen previously noticed, consisting of a 
fragment of the upper jaw, containing the second and third temporary molars 
and their permanent successors. Another specimen, in the same collection, 
belonging apparently to this species, consists of a fragment of the upper jaw 
of an adult individual, containing the back four molars, which are so far worn 
as to be inserted by fangs. The four teeth occupy a space of three and one- 
third inches in length and an inch in breadth. 
The two fragments of jaws, above mentioned, have a deep depression or 
lachrymal fossa in advance of the orbit, as in the Deer, Oreodon, &c.

PACHYDERMATA. 
Rhinoceros crassus, Leidy. 
The Niobrara collection contains small fragments of two lower jaws of young 
animals, a much worn upper incisor, a last upper molar, and an upper pre- 
molar, apparently of the deciduous series, of a species of Rhinoceros, which 
appears to have had almost the same size and formula of dentition as the recent 
Indian Rhinoceros, (R. indicus.) 
One of the fragments of lower jaws, consisting of the symphysial portion 
with sockets for four incisors, indicates these to have had the same relation of 
size and form as in R. indicus. 
The upper lateral incisor has nearly the form and size of the corresponding 
tooth of R. indicus. The antero-posterior diameter of its crown is two and 
one-third inches, and its transverse diameter three-fourths of an inch. 
The last upper molar, which belonged to an old individual as indicated by 
its worn condition, is of the form usual in most species of living Rhinoceros. 
Its antero-posterior diameter internally is two inches, and its oblique dia- 
meter posteriorly about half an inch more. 
The upper deciduous premolar has the narrower portion of its crown ante- 
riorly. The triturating surface of the specimen presents a tract of dentine on the 
outer wall and summits of the inner lobes of the tooth. The outer wall has a 
median ridge externally, corresponding to the most elevated point of its triturat- 
ing surface. The anterior border of the outer wall has the same form as the 
posterior one, but is shorter and more prominent. The inner lobes are em- 
braced by a strong basal ridge, as in R. occidentalis and Aceratheriiim incisivum. 
The antero-internal lobe curves inward and backward, and the succeeding lobe 
is transverse. Three conspicuous vallies bound the lobes, of which the middle 
one is deepest and the anterior one least so. From the outer wall of the tooth 
two folds project into the middle valley, and the posterior of these join 
one springing from the anterior face of the postero-internal lobe, thus isolat- 
ing a deep pit from the valley. If the fossil tooth were worn away to a level 
with its basal ridge it would exhibit four distinct enamel pits ; one corres- 
ponding to the outer end of the anterior valley, two for the middle valley, and 
one for the posterior valley.

Mastodon (Tetralophodon) mirificus, Leidy. 
One of the most interesting discoveries of Dr. Hayden in the pliocene depo- 
sit of the valley of the Niobrara, is the greater portion of the lower jaw of a 
Mastodon, most undoubtedly distinct from that species whose remains are so 
abundantly found in later deposits in the United States. The specimen be- 
longed to an old individual, as the last molar tooth had protruded and is con- 
siderably worn off at its anterior two-thirds ; and it indicates a much smaller 
animal than the M. ohioticus. The form of the jaw is like that of the existing 
Elephant of India. A single tooth, the last molar, occupies each side of it, and 
resembles the corresponding one of M. angustidens, of Europe, or of M. sivalen- 
sis, of the Sivalic Hills, of India. The crown measures nine inches antero-poste- 
riorly, and three and a half inches transversely, and possesses six transverse 
rows of conical lobes closely crowded. In advance of the sixth molars, pre- 
served in the specimen, no traces of alveoli are left for preceding teeth, but a 
sharp sigmoid ridge extends to the front of the jaw. 
The greatest breadth of the jaw outside the position 
of the molars is 15 inches.

Elephas (Euelephas) imperator, Leidy. 
The Niobrara collection also contains the anterior portion of an upper molar 
tooth of an Elephant of larger proportions than any which are known to us 
The triturating surface is within a line or two of five inches in breadth, 
and within a space of seven inches only eight enamel folds or double plates 
exist. In the most thick plated variety of teeth of the Elephas americanus 
which we have seen, in the same space ten folds were counted. As in the 
latter, E. primtgenius, and the recent Elephant of India, the enamel plates be- 
come worn on the triturating surface into transverse, strongly crenulated 
ellipses. 
The fragment of the tooth has been assumed to belong to an unnamed species 
from the fact that it was found in association with a fauna very distinct from 
any previously noticed.

the disturbed condition of the strata over which he is passing, unmistakable 
evidences that the hills looming- up before him are not merely elevations left 
by the denuda,tion of the surrounding country, but monuments of the former 
action here of those powerful subterranean forces which have played so impor- 
tant a part in modifying the earth's physical features. 
First, in passing from the undisturbed overlying Miocene formation, we come ^ 
directly upon No. 5, or the upper member of the Cretaceous series of the north- 
west, as subdivided in the published sections of the Nebraska formations. Then 
in regular succession Nos. 4, 3, 2, and 1, are passed over, all dipping sometimes 
at a high angle away from the Black Hills.* Beyond, and coming up from be- 
neath No. 1, an older series of very similar strata, containing many organic re- 
mains, which we regard as Jurassic types, is passed over, as we ascend the hills. 
Then we have some fine red gypsum bearing deposites, separated by a bed of lime- 
stone containing a few fossils like Coal measure forms. 
Next comes a group of well-marked Carboniferous formations, which repose 
upon a reddish and grayish sandstone of the same age as the Potsdam sand- 
stone of the New York system, â all of which were often seen highly inclined, 
and apparently conformable. The Potsdam, in its turn, was met with, some- 
with remarks in relation to the Geology of the Black Hills, has been prepared 
for the purpose of being read at the next meeting of the Academy of Natural 
Sciences in Philadelphia, and I therefore, beg leave to ask the authority of the 
Department thus to dispose of it. 
The region embraced by these Black Hills lies mainly between the north and 
south forks of the Shyenne River, and north-west of the well-known Mauvaises 
Terres of White River. Everything relating to it has hitherto been most im- 
perfectly understood. Situated remote from the great lines of travel to the Pa- 
cific, and inhabited by brave and numerous warriors of the Dakota nation, de- 
termined to resist the encroachments or intrusions of white men, it has 
remained an unknown land, especially to scientific men, whose pursuits are 
viewed by the Indians with superstitious apprehension. Even the trappers and 
traders have generally avoided this dangerous locality, and hence the most er- 
roneous ideas have been entertained of the position, direction, extent, and 
formation of these so-called Hills. 
Our exploration of the past year has, however, in a great measure settled 
these points. We now know them to be a detached portion of the great up- 
heaved mountain mass occupying the western portion of the territory of the 
United States, and the most eastern part of it yet discovered. They form an 
assemblage of mountain elevations lying between the meridians of 103Â° 15, and 
104Â° 45, west from Greenwich, and between the parallels of 43Â° 20 and 44Â° 45 
north latitude, the general deviation of the upland being about N. 20Â® W. The 
highest peaks are elevated about 6700 feet above the level of the sea, and from 
500 to 4500 feet above the surrounding country. 
The geological discoveries which the exploration has made are of much value 
to science, and the announcement of a few of the most important ones is the 
object of the paper herewith submitted. Mr. Meek has co-operated with Dr. 
Hayden in elaborating the results from the materials collected, without any 
pecuniary recompense from the government, Dr. Hayden being the Geologist to 
the expedition. Very respectfully your ob't serv't,

times far up on the higher points of the mountain, resting unconforraably upon 
the upturned edges of what appears to be a series of very ancient, highl}" meta- 
morphosed sedimentary strata, standing vertical. Beyond and beneath the lat- 
ter, the main body of the mountains seems to be made up of a coai se feldspathic 
granite, composed of large crystals of feldspar, with very small proportions of 
quartz and mica. This granite, and portions of the adjacent strata, were often 
seen traversed by various veins, dikes, and larger outbursts of basaltic and 
other eruptive rocks. 
In order that our remarks may be more clearly understood, we give below 
a general vertical section of the rocks seen in the Black Hills and around 
their base, showing their order of succession, and approximate thickness. It 
is not, of course pretended that all these formations were seen lying in con- 
tact at any one locality; but they were often met with, under such circum- 
stances, and holding such relations, as to leave little room to doubt that this is 
their true order of superposition.

The upper beds of the foregoing section, as seen along the Missouri, and in 
other portions of Nebraska, having been described on former occasions, and 
presenting few important new features, in the region of the Black Hills, we pass, 
for the present, at once to the consideration of those below, beginning with No. 
2. This formation, it will be observed, augments greatly in volume towards the 
west, its thickness along the Missouri, above the mouth of Big Sioux River, 
having been generally estimated at about ninety feet, while here, near the Black 
Hills, it attains a thickness of two hundred feet. As it appears to be en- 
tirely wanting on the Missouri, near Judith River above Fort Union, and is 
found to diminish rapidly as we ascend the Big Sioux from the Missouri ; while 
there are many facts pointing to the conclusion that it is one of the main fossil 
bearing beds of the Cretaceous series in Texas and New Mexico, we may rea- 
sonably infer that the sediment of which it is composed came originally from 
gome source fi\r to the southwest. 
Lithologically this formation presents much the same characters near the 
Black Hills as along the Missouri, being composed of dark gray laminated clays. 
Several of its characteristic fossils were also found near the S. E. base of tJie 
Black Hills amongst which we recognise Ammonites percarinatus (^UaW and Meek), of 
much larger size than those usually obtained along the Missouri, and numerous 
specimens of a Cijiherea, perhaps identical with C. tenuis (RnW and Meek). Some 
interesting new forms were likewise found associated with the foregoing, amongst 
which there is a large Ammonite, having septa somewhat like those of A. placenta, 
but rounded on the dorsum ; and a large strongly costated Ammonite, with very 
prominent nodes along the dorso-lateral margins, apparently very similar to a 
species described by Drs. Evans and Shumard under the name of J.. Galpinanus ; 
also a new species of Scaphites, closely related in the structure of its septa to 
^. hippocrepis of Dr. Kay. 
It will be remembered, we have in all our published papers, when speaking 
of that portion of the Nebraska section composing No. 1, expressed doubts re- 
specting its age. We placed it provisionally as the basis formation of the Cre- 
taceous series, but at the same time stated it was " not positively known to be- 
long to the Cretaceous system." In our last paper on the Nebraska formations, 
and their parallelism with those of the States, and the far southwest, communi- 
cated to the Academy in May, 1857, after having given all the facts in our pos- 
session bearing on this point, we stated that " although the weight of evidence

thus far favors the conclusion that this lower series (No. 1) is of the age of the 
Lower Green sand, or Neocomian of the old word, we yet want positive evidence 
that portions of it may noi be older than any part of the Cretaceous system." 
Although we have little direct additional evidence at this time in regard to 
the age of this series, as we have always understood it, we now know that from 
beneath its lower beds, around the base of the Black Hills, there rises a series 
of very similar strata, as may be seen by the foregoing section, separated from 
its base by no well-marked line of demarkation, and containing many fossils 
closely similar to those considered characteristic of the Jurassic system of the 
old world. At the same time we have failed to recognize amongst these fossils 
any forms peculiar to the Cretaceous epoch, or even very nearly analogous to 
species common in rocks of that age. 
The formations above alluded to as containing Jurassic types of fossils, 
are marked in the foregoing sections A, B, and C inclusive. But as before 
stated, these beds often pass so gradually, in their lithological characters, 
into No. 1 above, and so few fossils have been found near the junction, that 
we confess we have but a vague and indefinite idea in regard to the particular 
horizon at which the line should be drawn between them. Indeed, the gene- 
ral aspect of No. 1, and that of the formations below, are so very similar, and 
they are all so unlike the beds above, that if we were to classify them by 
their lithological characters alone, we should be inclined to view No. 1, and 
formations A, B, and C as forming one natural group, or at least to think 
that portions of No. 1, as we now understand it, should be classed with the 
series below. This view also appears to be the more reasonable when we 
take into consideration the great thickness of No. 1 in the vicinity of the 
Black Hills, and the fact that the beds A, B, and C contain a group of fossils 
apparently more nearly related to lower than upper Jurassic forms. 
Inasmuch, however, as numerous leaves beyond a doubt belonging to dicoty- 
ledonous trees, closely analogous to the oaks, willows, and other existing forest 
trees, are known to occur in No. 1 along the Missouri, near the Big Sioux, and 
in northeastern Kansas,""" and we have a BacuUte from similar beds, apparently 
of the same age, near the mouth of Judith River, on the upper Missouri, â while 
we also learn from the letters and notes of our deceased friend, Mr. Henry Prat- 
ten, that he saw a species of Baculite in formations presenting the same charac- 
ters, and seeming to occupy the same position, along the Platte above Fort La- 
ramie, we think we hazard little in viewing at least a considerable portion of 
No. 1 as belonging to the Cretaceous system. 
Another fact favoring the opinion that No, 1, even down as low as we have 
provisionally carried it in the Black Hills section, probably belongs to the lower 
Cretaceous, is the occurrence at its base of a bed conl&mmg Amm.onites and Os- 
trea^ along with Unio^ Planorbis, and Paludina ; an association of fossils which, 
in that position, carries the mind rather to the Wealden than to older forma- 
tions. 
The occurrence of these forms at this horizon, also leads us to suspect that a 
considerable portion of the estuary beds at the mouth of Judith River, above 
Fort Union, in regard to the age of which we have been so much puzzled, may 
be, as first suggested by Dr. Leidy, a representative of the Wealden, and as we 
were then inclined to suppose, belong to our No. 1. 
The close similarity between the lithological characters of these deposits, and 
those of some of the Tertiary formations of the north-west, and the estuary 
character of their fossils, together with the analogy of many of the species of 
mollusca found in one of the upper beds, (which may be an outlier of Tertiary 
resting on older formations), taken in connection with the fact that amongst the 
fossils collected from one of the middle beds (see section, page 124, vol. viii. Pro- 
ceedings, 1857,) there were some fragments of a Trionyx^ regarded by Dr. Leidy as 
identical with a species occurring in well-marked Tertiary deposits near Long

No. 1, as seen in Kansas.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 
Lake, below Fort Clark, led us subsequently to think the whole of these estuary 
beds, near the Judith, might possibly be only an outlier of Tertiary reposing 
upon deposits of the age of our No. 1. At the same time, in consequence of the 
occurrence in them of remains regarded by Dr. Leidyas analogous io Lepidotus^ 
Iguanodon^ and Megalosaurus^ we stated that "in the midst of evidence of such a 
conflicting nature, it is unsafe to express any very positive opinion respecting 
the age of these formations." 
Since we know that there is a similar group of beds at the base of No. 1, as 
we now understand it, near the Black Hills, containing a mingling of freshwater 
and marine fossils, although we are not sure any of them are specifically identical 
with those found near the Judith, we are inclined to think our first views in re- 
gard to these Judith River formations will prove to be correct, or in other woids, 
the beds from which the saurian remains, described by Dr. Leidy, were obtained, 
will yet prove to be a part of the series we include in No. 1 of the Black Hills 
section. This view receives additional support, too, from the fact that the Judith 
River freshwater or estuary formations were often seen much upheaved and 
distorted, while around the Black Hills the Tertiary deposits appear to lie un- 
disturbed upon the upheaved older rocks, in such a manner as to indicate that 
the last period of disturbance amongst the strata of this region occured af- 
ter the close of the Cretaceous epoch, but previous to the deposition of the Ter- 
tiary. 
The evidence pointing to the conclusion that formations A, B, and C of the 
foregoing section should be regarded as probably Jurassic, is, first, the affinities 
of their organic remains ; and secondly, their stratigraphical position. It is true 
we do not pretend to have recognized in these deposits any genera peculiar to 
the Jura ; but at the same time we have failed to identify amongst these fossils 
any species belonging to genera limited in their range to the Cretaceous sys- 
tem ; while in their specific relations, so far as we have been able to make com- 
parisons, they are nearly ail much more closely allied to Jurassic than Creta- 
ceous forms, if not indeed actually identical with the former in some cases. This 
will, perhaps, be better understood by the following comparisons of some of the 
species described in this paper, from these formations : â â  
\st Fentacrinus asteriscus^ n. s. p., from near the lower part of formation C, is 
so nearly like the Liassic P. scalaris, Goldfuss, that it is with some hesitation 
we have regarded it as new. 
2d. Avicula (^Monotis) temcicostaia, n. s. p., ranging from the lower part of the 
bed A to near the base of bed C, is very closely related to M. substriata of Min- 
ster, from the Lias. 
"id. Area {Cuculla^a) inornaia, n. s. p., from the lower part of bed A, is very 
similar to C. Munsteri (Zeiien), also from the Lias. 
Ath. Panopcea {Mi/acites) subelUpticay n. s. p., from the bed C, is similar lo 
the Liassic forms M. Liassensis and M. Alduininus of Quenstedt. 
5th. Ammonites cordiformis, n. s. p., from bed A, is of the same type as the 
Oolitic species A. cordatus (Sowerby). 
<oth. Belmniies densus^ n. s. p., from bed A, is scarcely distinguishable from 
the Oolitic species B. ecceniricus, Blinville, if indeed it is really distinct. 
In addition to the above, there are in the collection from the beds A, B, and 
C, other species we have not yet had time to describe, which closely resemble 
Liassic and Oolitic forms. These facts when viewed in connection with the 
stratio-raphical position of these deposits, below what appear to be lower Cre- 
taceous formations, and as above stated, so far as we yet know, the absence in 
them of well-marked Cretaceous types, are, we think, sufficient reasons for sup- 
posing they probably represent the Jurassic system.-^- 
* On a former occasion we expressed the opinion that Mr. Marcou was mistaken in re- 
gard to the existence of Jurassic rocks in the region of the Black Hills. This opinion 
waLS based upon the fact that one of us had traversed the belt of country he intended to 
color, east of these hills, as Jurassic, and found it occupied by Tertiary and Cretaceonjs 
formations. We also knew his map of this region had been mainly colored theoretically,

It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary for us to remark that the presence of Am- 
monites and BelemniteSj in the rocks above alluded to, aside from the other or- 
ganic remains, is alone satisfactory evidence that they do not belong to the 
Triassic epoch. It is true the bed C is not known to contain either Belemniies 
or Ammonites^ but so many of the same forms associated with these fossils iu 
the beds above, range down into the bed C, that unless it be the lowest stratum 
of yellowish gray sandstone at its base, there appears to be little reason for sus- 
pecting that it may belong to another system of rocks. In regard to this lowest 
stratum of formation C, we would state that the fossils contained in it are casts 
in a bad state of preservation, but as near as we have been able to determine, 
some of them appear to belong to types occurring in the beds above; we, there- 
fore, for the present, place it provisionally as a part of the group composing 
formation C; but it is possible future investigations may bring to light facts 
that may prove it to belong to an older series, though it evidently is not Car- 
boniferous, nor Permian. 
Carboniferous Rocks of the Black Hills. 
As may be seen by consulting the foregoing general section of the formations 
seen in and around the Black Hills, the rocks we regard as of Jurassic age, 
repose in that region upon a group of deposits, the larger portion, at least, 
of which clearly belong to the Carboniferous epoch. 
"We would, however, just here remark before entering upon the discussion of 
the Carboniferous formations of the Black Hills, that near the south-eastern 
base of these hills some loose masses of a cherty rock were seen, on more than 
one occasion, under circumstances indicating that the stratum from which they 
were derived holds a position between the base of the bed C and the bed D of 
the section. Yet as these cherty masses were no where actually seen in place, 
we have not given them a position in the Black Hills' section, though there can, 
scarcely be a doubt that they belong to it. The fossils they contain, or at any 
rate several of them, are identical with species occurring in a formation in 
north-eastern Kansas, now known to be of Permian age. 
The first formation in the descending order of the foregoing section we are 
inclined to place, (at least provisionally) in the Carboniferous system, is the bed 
D, which is composed of a brick-red fine silicious or argillaceous, slightly gritty 
material, effervescing very feebly in acids. Although from a hundred to one 
hundred and fifty feet in thickness, no vestiges of any kind of organic remains 
were seen in any part of this bed; but it was always found to be characterized 
by large quantities of gypsum, in the form of seams, layers, and large beds or 
irregular masses. 
Beneath the foregoing bed we have a bluish and reddish gray, somewhat 
gritty limestone (E of the section), varying from 10 to 50 feet in thickness, anci 
containing fossils, resembling coal measure forms. The collections from thip 
rock consist of a small smooth spirifer^ broader and more compressed than IS. 
lineatus, but otherwise somewhat similar, two or three species of 3Iacrocheiluy, 
two small species of rieuroiotnaria, and one or two species of Bellerophon, all in 
a rather bad state of preservation, but showing very satisfactorily their generic 
characters. 
and was necessarily based upon very erroneoua views in regard to its topography. In 
addition to this, we had found the immense area represented by him as New Red Sand- 
stone, in the upper Missouri country, almost entirely made up of Tertiary and Cretaceous 
deposits ; while not a single Jurassic or Triassic fosail had ever been found throughout 
the whole country. 
Since the position of the Black Hills has been determined by Lieut. Warren, we now 
know the area occupied by the Jurassic belt Mr. Marcou intended to place east of these 
hills, actually lies rather on the west of their middle portion, and does probably cover 
some surface occupied by the formations we regarded as Jurassic. 
By these remarks we do not wish to be understood as intimating that a geologist is re- 
sponsible for errors into which he may be led by incorrect topographical maps ; nor do 
we wish to withhold from Mr. Marcou the credit justly due him for having first suggested 
the existence of Jnrassic rocks in this region.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
Next in the descending order, we have formation F, which is two hundred 
and fifty to three hundred feet in thickness, and very similar, towards the up- 
per part, to the red bed D in its composition, excepting that it contains less 
gypsum; below, it passes into a very hard compact gray sandstone, the whole 
apparently destitute of fossils. 
It will, perhaps, be remembered we mentioned in one of our former papers the 
existence of some facts which we thought point to the conclusion that the great 
gypsum deposits of the south-west, might be on a parallel with No. 1, or the 
lower part of No. 2 of our Nebraska section. From the great similarity of these 
red formations near the Black Hills, to the red gypsum bearing deposits de- 
scribed by Mr. Marcou and others, in Texas, Arkansas, and New Mexico, we are 
now inclined to the opinion that they all hold the same position, and are of 
course much older than our No. 1. 
The entire absence, so far as we yet know, of organic remains in these red 
formations in the region of the Black Hills, as well as in the south-west, 
shows that during their deposition the physical conditions in the waters where 
they were deposited, must have been unfavorable to the existence of animal 
life. 
That the lower bed F, of the foregoing section, is of Carboniferous age, is 
very probable, coming in as it does immediately above a well-marked Carbonifer- 
ous formation, and below a limestone containing fossils closely similar to well- 
known coal measure forms, two of which belong to genera (^Bellerophon and 
Macrocheilm)^ not known, we believe, to range above the Carboniferous sys- 
tem. 
It is not, however, so easy to determine the age of the upper red bed D. From 
its stratigraphical position, as well as lithological characters, it might with 
almost as much propriety be referred to the Permian or Triassic systems, as to 
the Carboniferous. Yet as it appears to have been deposited during a repetition 
of the same physical conditions that prevailed during the deposition of the bed 
F, we think it is perhaps safer to refer it provisionally, in the absence of palaeon- 
tological evidence, to the Carboniferous system, though it is possible both these 
red beds and the intervening limestone may prove to be Permian. 
Immediately below the foregoing formations there is a rather fine grained 
somewhat gritty whitish subcrystalline limestone (G of the section), containing 
in great numbers a species of Spirifer, perhaps new, and resembling more nearly 
forms common in the lower Carboniferous series of the west than those of the coal 
measures ; along with this a fragment of another Spirifer was found, having fas- 
ciculate bifurcating costte, like S. Meiisehachanus (Rcemer), a common coal mea- 
sure fossil ; also two species of Produchts^ one of which is probably identical 
with P. semireticiilatuSj and an other similar, but smaller species, with apparently 
a less deeply marked sinus in the larger valve, and a shorter hinge. This bed 
passes gradually down into a yellowish gritty somewhat friable limestone, in 
which was found a Spirifer having a high area like S. cuspidaius ; and a large 
PJuomphalus, apparently identical with a species common in the Encrinital or 
Burlington limestone of the lower Carboniferous series in the west, â the two 
rocks are fifty feet in thickness. 
The succeeding formation is a hard yellowish gritty limestone often tinged 
with red (H of section), in which were found specimens of a small smooth Tere- 
bratula, a small deeply sinuate Productus, and a Syringopora ? having small, 
straight, very regularly disposed tubes, about -06 inch in diameter, and separated 
by spaces about -09 inch across. In the middle of this formation, which is 
usually forty feet in thickness, there is often seen an 8 foot layer of bluish rather 
compact argillaceous limestone, containing a smooth Terebralula resembling T. 
mbtileta (Hall), but perhaps distinct, and a Productus like P. cora^ in the fine- 
ness of its strisB. 
The fossils in the collection from these lower limestones (G- and H) are un- 
fortunately almost all in a very bad state of preservation ; so that it is nearly 
impossible to determine with any degree of certainty their specific characters. 
As near as can be ascertained, however, the majority of them appear to resemble

more nearly lower than upper Carboniferous forms, though some of them cer- 
tainly are like coal measure species. 
The color, texture, and composition of the beds are such as to carry the mind 
at once to the lower Carboniferous series, and quite unlike those of any rock 
known in the western coal measures. 
Lower Silurian. 
Potsdam Sandstone, 
At several places in the Black Hills, the oldest Carboniferous bed of that re- 
gion (H) was seen reposing, to all appearances conformably, upon a bed thirty 
to fifty feet in thickness of reddish and grayish sandstone, composed of angular 
grains of quartz, cemented by silicious, and sometimes small portions of cal- 
careous matter. The fossils obtained from this rock were Lingula antigua^ 
(Hall), and great numbers of a small shell very similar to L. "prima (Conrad), 
but from its thickness and structure probably an Oholus; also a shell nearly 
related to 0. appolinus^ as figured by Murchison and De Vernueil, in#heir work 
on the geology of Russia, but perhaps nev/, and fragments of a Trilobite belong- 
ing apparently to one of the forms figured by Dr. Owen from the lower sand- 
stones of Minnesota. 
The above mentioned fossils, as will be at once understood by the Paleon- 
tologist, clearly prove this lower sandstone (I) to belong to the oldest portion of 
the Silurian system, or in other words, to the Potsdam sandstone of the New 
York series. The identification of this rock, at this remote point in the far 
west, we regard as a matter of peculiar interest, proving, as it does, the exten- 
sion of that formation several hundred miles further westward than it has 
hitherto been known to occur in this country.* 
Metamorphic and Igneous Rocks. 
At almost every place where the base of the Potsdam sandstone was seen in 
the Black Hills, it was found to repose upon what appears to be upturned edges 
of an ancient series of sedimentary rocks. These older rocks present the ap- 
pearance of having their strata thrown into a vertical or highly inclined condi- 
tion, while the Potsdam, although much disturbed, rests unconformably upon 
them. 
Further in towards the interior of the mountain, and beneath the metamor- 
phic rocks, as already stated, the main body of the Black Hills is composed 
chiefly of a coarse feldspathic granite and other igneous rocks. 
DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW FOSSILS.-^ 
Pentacrinus asteriscus. 
Our knowledge of this crinoid is entirely derived from detached pieces of its 
column, and other parts, as seen imbedded in a sandy matrix cemented by cal- 
careous matter. These segments or joints of the column may be characterized 
as rather thin, small, and very symmetrical pentagonal, star-shaped bodies, the 
rays of which are usually longer than wide, and rather acutely angular at their 
extremities. Through the centre of each joint there is a very small circular per- 
foration, from which five regular lance-oval, petaloid areas radiate, one to the ex- 
tremity of each of the angles ; the areas being bounded by^rather narrow, slightly 
elevated transversely crenulate margins. 
The above description applies more particularly to the largest sized speci- 
mens, measuring about -18 inch across from point to point of the opposite angles. 
Associated with these there are other much smaller joints, varying from -05 to 
â¢10 inch in diameter. These have proportionably shorter and broader rays, or

angles, which, however, appear never to be rounded at the extremities. It is 
possible these smaller joints may belong to another species, though we incline 
to the opinion that they are only the joints of smaller individuals of the species 
here indicated. 
The star-like surfaces of the column joints above described, present some 
varieties of form, but usually resemble so closely those of S. scalaris, Goldf., 
that we are in some doubt about the propriety of considering our fossil a dis- 
tinct species. These joints are all much smaller than those figured by Goldfuss, 
and appear never to have had the angles so short and rounded as some of the 
examples given by that author and Quenstedt, of F. scalaris.

near the front. Length -54 inch ; breadth -35 inch ; thickness (depth of the 
two valves) -16 inch. 
Locality and position. â Western and south-western base Black Hills, towards 
lower part of bed C of foregoing section. 
Inoceramus umbonatus. 
We only know this species from an internal cast of a left valve, with 
portions of the shell adhering near the beak and hinge. This valve is 
remarkably gibbous, and the beak, which is a little oblique and near the 
anterior side, is much produced, elevated and involuted, so as to give the 
valve the appearance of some of the Palaeozoic univalves usually referred 
to the genus Capulus. The aperture of this valve is subcircular, being 
straighter on the hinge side than elsewhere. The portion of the shell remain- 
ing near the hinge is very thick, and composed of an inner laminated layer, 
and an external coarsely fibrous portion, the latter being much thicker than the 
other. We know nothing of the surface markings, beyond the fact that 
obscure concentric undulations are visible on the cast. 
The remarkable form of this valve indicates that the other must have been 
comparatively much less gibbous, or, perhaps, bore the relations to this, of 
an operculum to a univalve shell, as in 7. involutus of Sowerby. It is the first 
species of this type discovered in American formations, so far as we know. 
Height 3.10 inches ; length 2.38 inches. 
Locality and position. â This specimen was obtained from near Fort Benton 
on the upper Missouri ; but as it was found by a person unacquainted with 
geology, at a locality not yet visited by any person familiar with the formations 
of the country, its position is doubtful. The composition of the matrix, however, 
as well as the thickness and structure of the shell, lead us to think it 
holds a position in No. 4 of the general section ; all the north-western species 
yet known from formations below No. 3 being comparatively thin and entirely 
fibrous. 
Avicula (Monotis) tenuicostata. 
Shell suborbicular, or slightly oval, a little oblique, usually higher than long ; 
valves nearly equally convex; anterior side subtruncate, rounding rather 
abruptly into the hinge above, forming a broad oblique curve below ; basal and 
postero-basal margins rounded ; upper posterior margin sloping obliquely for-

ward, but often curving gently outwards just below its junction with the ex- 
tremity of the hinge line, so as to make the angle of the small, more or less 
compressed posterior wing not more than eighty or ninety degrees ; hinge line 
less than the greatest length of the shell. Beaks scarcely oblique, located 
nearer the anterior than the posterior side ; that of the left or larger valve more 
prominent than the other, and extending a little above the hinge ; beak of the 
smaller valve more compressed, and scarcely distinct from the hinge margin. 
Surface marked by small, obscure, slightly elevated, radiating lines or cost?e, 
which are less than the spaces between, and crossed by fine, nearly obsolete 
lines of growth, usually most distinct near the upper anterior margin. Length 
'60 inch ; height '64 inch ; breadth '26 inch. 
The sinus for the passage of the pedal muscle in the anterior margin of the 
smaller valve is rather deep, narrow, and connected with a deeply impres- 
sed narrow groove, which extends on the outside of the valve nearly parallel to 
the hinge, quite to the beak. 
The surface markings are usually rather obscure on both valves, and often 
nearly obsolete on the smaller one. Young individuals are more nearly orbicu- 
lar than mature specimens.

and curving very gradually upwards toward the front ; dorsum carinate from a 
little behind the beaks posteriorly, its outline forming a broad, sloping curve. 
Hinge nearly straight, rather short, rounding gradually into the dorsal edge

cate above, somewhat narrowly rounded below ; base nearly straight along the 
middle, but not exactly parallel to the hinge, rounding up more gradually to- 
wards the front than behind. Beaks rising somewhat above the hinge, rather 
pointed, incurved and very slightly oblique, located a little in advance of the 
middle ; posterior umbonial slopes subangular. Hinge rather long, but not 
equalling the greatest length of the shell ; posterior teeth two or three in each

Unio nucalis. 
Shell oval, moderately gibbous ; extremities ratlier narrowly rounded, the 
most projecting part of the posterior end being below the middle, and that of 
the anterior extremity above it ; base semioval, often quite prominent in the 
middle ; beaks a little depressed, located about half way between the centre 
and the anterior end ; umbonial region rather gibbous, and rising above the 
hinge, subangular on the posterior slopes. Surface marked by fine lines of 
growth, and more or less distinct concentric wrinkles ; the latter becoming 
quite small and very regular on the beaks. Traces of extremely small regular 
radiating wrinkles are also sometimes seen between the obscure angle on the 
back part of the umbones, and the hinge. Length 1-85 inches ; height 1-34 
inches ; breadth 1 inch. 
"We were at first in much doubt about referring this shell to the genus Unio^ 
because it is associated with a small oyster and Ammonites Henryi of this paper. 
The hinge, however, as far as we have been able to make out its characters, is 
like that of the genus Unio, and entirely different from Cardinia, and other 
forms usually resembling Unio. In the left valve, (we have not seen the hinge 
of the right valve,) it is moderately thick, somewhat arched, and provided 
with two posterior lateral teeth, which are elongated parallel to the cardinal 
edge, and separated by a groove apparently for the reception of a tooth in the 
other valve. The cardinal tooth, which is placed nearly under the beak, is 
rather irregular, somewhat flattened, and a little corrugated on the edge. 
In addition to the foregoing characters, we are led to think this must be a 
true Unio, from finding in the same matrix several specimens of a small PIa~ 
norbis and a fragment of Paludina. 
Locality and position. â Southwest base of Black Hills, in lower part of No. 1. 
CORBULA INORNATA. 
Shell small, trigonal, very gibbous ; anterior side more or less rounded ; pos- 
terior extremity angular below, base semiovate, the most prominent part being 
towards the front ; hinge sloping from the beaks, which are central ; posterior 
umbonial slopes angular. Right valve more convex than the other, and hav- 
ing its beak more gibbous, elevated and incurved ; but the margins of the two 
valves are equal, nearly or quite closed, and a little warped. Surface nearly 
smooth or only marked by very obscure lines of growth, and sometimes a few 
indistinct concentric wrinkles near the base. Length '27 inch ; breadth '29 ; 
height of larger valve 23 inch, of smaller 20 inch. 
We have not yet had an opportunity to see the interior of this shell, but 
owing to the fact that there is often seen on the posterior side of each valve, 
just within the posterior umbonial angle, a rather distinct groove curving down 
from the beaks, directly over the position of the raised internal lamina in our 
genus Corhulamella, we suspect this species may possibly be found to possess; 
the internal characters of that genus. 
Locality and position. â Long Lake, No. 5, of the general section. 
Panop^a (Myacites) subelliptica. 
Shell narrow, subelliptical, or subovate, moderately compressed, extremities 
narrowly rounded, the posterior end being more compressed than the other, 
and sometimes very faintly truncate on the oblique upper slope, both ends 
apparently nearly closed, or but slightly gaping. Base forming a very broad 
gentle curve, rounding up gradually towards the extremities ; dorsal outline 
slightly concave in front and rear of the beaks, the anterior slope being more 
abrupt than the other. Umbonial region obscurely angular on the posterior 
side ; beaks rather depressed, but rising above the hinge, approximate, and 
located in advance of the middle. Surface of cast marked by small, moderately 
distinct, irregular concentric wrinkles of growth. Muscular and pallial im-

Teredo globosa. 
Shell globose, thin, rounded or subtruncate and gaping posteriorly ; anterior 
hiatus large, and consisting of a rectangular notch extending from the base 
half way up towards the beaks, and back to the middle of the shell. Um- 
bonial region gibbous ; beaks placed near the anterior side, much incurved 
obliquely forward. Surface marked by rather distinct lines of growth, which, 
on the back part of the shell, curve down, parallel to the posterior border, 
until they approach a small indistinct ridge, or slightly elevated line, passing 
down from the umbones, when they curve abruptly upwards nearly parallel 
to the margin of the anterior hiatus, becoming at the same time much finer and 
more regular, as well as very finely and beautifully crenulate ; on reaching a 
small, indistinct groove, which curves down obliquely from the beaks towards 
the corner of the anterior notch, these lines are abruptly deflected upon the 
anterior portion of the shell extending out over the notch. 
The tubes are thin, subcylindrical, and sometimes nearly straight, but gen- 
erally variously curved ; and increase gradually from the smaller to the larger 
end. Length of shell -23 inch ; height and breadth of do. each -22 inch. Di- 
ameter of one of the larger tubes .26 inch. 
Locality and position. â 'Square Butte, near Fort Clark, upper part of No. 5 
of the general section. Found in great numbers in large masses of fossil 
wood. 
Pholas cdneata. 
Shell small, very thin, cuneiform, most gibbous at the anterior end, which is 
truncate, and more or less gaping, â narrowing and much compressed posterior- 
ly ; anal extremity very narrowly rounded and gaping a little. Dorsal margin 
declining slightly from behind the beaks, with a very gentle convex curve to- 
wards the posterior end ; basil margin nearly straight, or a little concave in 
outline. Beaks small, located at the anterior extremity, scarcely rising above 
the hinge, incurved and touching. 
The surface is marked by small concentric wrinkles, which are much more 
distinct on the gibbous anterior half of the shell than behind, and crossed 
by two grooves, the anterior one of which is linear, but well defined (on the 
cast), and extends from the beaks downwards, and a little backwards, so as to 
reach the base in advance of the middle ; the other groove is more shallow, 
broader, less distinctly defined, and extends from the back part of the beaks, 
obliquely backwards and downwards, just within the subangular posterior um- 
bonial slopes. 
There is also a small ridge or elevated line, on the anterior end of each valve, 
curving parallel to the concentric wrinkles, from the base about half way up 
towards the beaks, from which point it is deflected abruptly at right angles for- 
ward, so as to delineate exactly the form of the angular notch or hiatus of 
Teredo and Xyophaga; but the margin of the valve, (at any rate in adult shells) 
extends out beyond this line, so as to leave a comparatively small hiatus. 
The posterior muscular impression is long, very narrow, and placed near the 
postero-dorsal edge ; while the pallial line passes obliquely down near the 
middle of the valves, and appears to be provided with two sinuses, the upper 
one being very small, and lower of medium size. The space behind the pallial 
line is marked on the interior by extremely fine, obscure radiating striae. Length

AcTEON (Solidula) attennuta. 
Shell small, elongate ; spire elevated ; volutions (number unknown) depres- 
sed, or but slightly convex, separated by a shallow, but distinct suture. Sur- 
face ornamented by numerous small punctate striae, usually less than the 
spaces between, and numbering about fourteen on the second turn ; sometimes 
there is on the body whorl a much smaller stria between each two of the 
others ; while near the base of this volution the striae are stronger than above, 
and more distinctly punctate. Lip and columella unknown. Length about 
â¢57 inch ; breadth 17th inch ; apical angle convex, divergence 18Â°. 
As our specimen is not in a condition to show the collumella, we are left in 
some doubt respecting its generic relations, but its form and surface markings 
'are similar to those of species usually referred to the genus Acteon. 
Locality and position. â Yellow-stone river, formation No. 4 and 5 blended 
together. 
Helicoceras? tortus. 
Our specimen of this species is a fragment, consisting of one septate volution 
of the spire. This evidently belonged to a sinistral conical shell, composed (at 
any rate during a part of its growth) of rounded whorls, which are coiled in 
an ascending spiral, so far out of the same plane as ,to be disconnected by a 
free space equalling about one-third the diameter of each succeeding whorl be- 
low. The umbilical cavity left within, is, at its aperture, less than the diameter 
of the largest volution ; while the whorls increase in size, so as nearly to double 
their diameter each turn. The surface is ornamented by two rows of rather low 
nodes, passing round the lower outer side (the apex of the spire being above) 
of the whorls, â and small, but distinct annular costas, which of. en bifurcate at 
the nodes. 
The siphuncle is very small, and in the specimen before us presents the re- 
markable peculiarity of gradually changing its position in passing from the 
smaller to the larger extremity of the fragment before us. That is to say, â at 
the smaller end of the specimen, it occupies exactly the middle of the dorsal, or 
outer side, but in passing round it gradually curves upwards, so that by the 
time it reaches the larger end, it comes out on the summit of the whorl. Con- 
sequently, if it goes on in this way, another turn of the spire would bring it 
on the inner or umbilical side, â a third on the underside, and the fourth again 
on the dorsal or outer side. It is also worthy of note that the lobes and 
saddles of the septa, and to some extent the nodes, followed the peculiar curve 
of the siphuncle, so that it would seem the whorls not only form an ascending 
spiral curve, but are, as it were, at the same time, twisted in such a manner as 
to change the relative positions of the dorsal and ventral sides. 
The septa are provided with six lobes and six saddles, the larger of which are 
profoundly sinuous and variously branched. The dorsal lobe is comparatively 
small, and ornamented at the extremity by two nearly equal branches, each of 
which is subdivided into from three to five small divisions with sinuous margins ; 
above this there is a small lateral branchlet on each side, the right hand one 
of which is bifid. The superior lateral lobe is considerably larger than the 
dorsal lobe, and deeply divided by its auxiliary saddle into two large unequal 
spreading branches, of which the one on the ventral side is somewhat longer than 
the other, and provided at the extremity by two nearly equal spreading bifid 
branchlets and several smaller digitations ; the other principal division is less 
deeply divided at the extremity into two unequal parts, the terminal or longer 
of which is bifid : the margins of the main branches, as well as of the body of 
the lobe, are also provided with several subordinate divisions with sinuous edges. 
The inferior lateral lobe is somewhat smaller, but in other respects scarcely 
differs from the superior lateral lobe. 
The dorsal saddle is nearly as large as the inferior lateral lobe, but less spread- 
ing above, and narrower, as well as more oblique at its base ; while its extre- 
mity is profoundly divided, by its auxiliary lobe, into two subequal tripaitite, 
[March^

deeply sinuous branches. The lateral saddle is very nearly of the same size and 
form as the dorsal lobe, but less oblique, and a little more deeply divided by its 
long auxiliary lobe. 
The greater transverse diameter of our specimen is 2-43 inches ; do. of um- 
bilicus, -65 inch ; diameter of larger end of the whorl 1-04 inch ; do. of the 
smaller end -74 inch; diameter of the siphuncle at the larger extremity -6 inch. 
The peculiar twisted character of the volutions in this shell led us to suspect 
it may be found, when better specimens are obtained, to constitute a distinqt 
genus from any Cephalapod hitherto described. For the present, however, we 
refer it provisionally to the genus to which it appears most nearly related. 
Locality and position. â Great Bend of the Missouri, lower part of No. 4, general

TURRILITBS (HeLICOCERAS) COCHLEATDS. 
Shell sinistral, very thin, and composed of rounded, nearly or quite contiguous 
whorls, which gradually increase in size from the smaller to the larger extre- 
mity; umbilicus slightly wider than the diameter of the largest whorl. Surface 
ornamented by numerous small rather irregular bifurcating, annular costae, 
which first pass obliquely backwards and outwards from the umbilicus above, 
then curve so as to cross the dorsum obliquely downwards and forwards, but 
on reaching the lower side, they curve backwards again, in approaching the 
ventral side. There are also two rows of obscure, flattened, or depressed oval 
nodes, one of which passes round nearly exactly over the siphuncle, which 
occupies the middle of the outer side of the whorl, while the other is placed 
less than one-fifth of the circumference of the whorl lower down. 
The septa are rather distant, and divided into six lobes and six saddles, which 
are a little unsymmetrical, in their subordinate details, but about of the same size 
and general form on opposite sides of the siphuncle. The dorsal lobe is small, and 
ornamented at the extremit}^, by four small branches, the two terminal of which 
are a little larger than the others, slightly dissimilar, and each provided witii 
five or six unequal digitations ; the other two divisions are not exactly opposite, 
differ slightly in form, and are each armed with about from three to five or six 
unequal digitate points : above these principal terminal divisions, there are 
also along the body of the lobe a few small alternating lateral pinnules. 
The superior lateral lobe is greatly larger than the dorsal lobe, and very 
deeply divided into two great, subequal, spreading branches, of which the one 
on the ventral side is a little larger than the other (especially on the side of the 
whorl below the siphuncle), and unequally subdivided into three bifid branchlets, 
the two terminal of which are much larger than the third, and each ornamented 
by several small unequal, projecting points, the other main branch is divided 
into two principal, bifid branchlets with many smaller sinuosities and digitations. 
The inferior lateral lobe is somewhat smaller than the superior, but in other 
respects very similar. 
The dorsal saddle is small, very oblique, much contracted at its base, and 
divided above into two unequal variously subdivided, sinuous branches. The 
lateral saddle is not so oblique, but does not otherwise differ materially from 
the dorsal saddle. 
Our specimen consists of a little more than half a volution, the greatest 
transverse diameter of which is 2-34 inches; breadth of umbilicus -75 inch. 
Diameter of the volution at larger end, which is a little oval, -73 inch by -64 
inch ; do. of smaller end, which is very nearly circular, -54 inch. 
It is not easy to determine, from our specimen, whether this species is most 
nearly related to the genus Turrilites or Helicoceras. In the rounded and com- 
parative slender form of its whorls, as well as the large size of its umbilicus, it 
is more like the latter genus ; while the fact that the volutions are nearly or 
quite in contact, as is shown by an impression left on the matrix, would seem 
to indicate that it must belong to the genus Turrilites. It is probable, however,

Helicoceras tenuicostatus. 
The fragment upon which we propose to found this species is slender, nearly 
eylindrical, and increases very gradually in size, from the smaller to the larger 
extremity. It makes a remarkably broad sinistral, ascending spiral curve, so 
as to leave the volutions disconnected, and form a large umbilical space, having 
a diameter about four times as broad as that of the largest whorl. The 
siphuncle is of medium size, and occupies a position above the middle of the 
outer side of the volutions. 
The surface is ornamented by rather irregular moderately distinct annular 
costae, which occasionally bifurcate, and pass nearly straight around the whorls 
On the outside of the volutions the costse are stronger than within, and show, 
a disposition to swell out into obscure nodes. Length of fragment 1-64 inch ; 
diameter at larger extremity -49 inch ; do. of smaller end -44 inch. 
We have for a long time past had this specimen in our possession, but always 
supposed it identical with Ilamites 3Iortoni^ (Hall and Meek, Mem. Am. Acad. 
Arts and Sci. N. S. vol. 5, pi. iv. fig. 3 a. c.) which is probably a Helicoceras. 
After a more careful comparison, however, we find the following differences, 
which we think are of specific importance, â in the first place, the costas of the 
shell now before us are less prominent, and encircle the volutions much less 
obliquely than those of II. iMortoni ; while the siphuncle occupies a higher 
position in the dorsum, and the spiral coil of the shell was sinistral, while that 
of H. Mortoni is dextral. In addition to the foregoing, there are well marked 
differences in the details of the lobes and saddles of the septa, which cannot, 
however, be well explained without the use of figures. 
Locality and position. â Great Bend of the Missouri, lower part, No. 4. 
TURRILITES ? UMBILICATUS. 
We have of this species nearly an entire volution, a little more than half of 
which is septate, but not in a condition to show the form of the lobes. It is a 
sinistral shell, the rounded volutions of which are coiled in an ascending spiral, 
nearly or quite in contact, and increase gradually in size, from the smaller to 
the larger extremity. The umbilicus is a little less than the diameter of the 
largest volution ; and the siphuncle occupies a position in the middle of the 
outer side of the whorls. 
The surface is ornamented by rather distinct, annular bifurcating costae, 
which, on the upper side of the whorls, curve first obliquely backwards and out- 
wards from the umbilicus, then forwards and downwards, as they cross the 
dorsum, and on reaching the under side, curve inwards to the umbilicus. There 
are also two rows of more or less distinct nodes passing around the under outer 
side of the whorls, at which the costse usually bifurcate. 
Greatest transverse diameter across the volutions and umbilicus 3-20 inch ; 
breadth of larger end of whorl 1-19 inch ; do. of smaller end 1-06 inch. 
Not having seen the septa of this species, it is with some hesitation we have 
considered it distinct from T. cochleatus of this paper ; though it differs from 
our specimen of that species in having less neatly rounded volutions, much 
stronger nodes and costoe, and proportionably a little smaller umbilicus ; they 
may, however, be only varieties of the same species.

mities, a free space equalling about half the greater diameter of the larger 
limb ; both ends are then extended in the same direction, and, apparently, 
nearly parallel. 
The surface is ornamented by strong, rather angular more or less oblique 
annular costae, which occasionally bifurcate on the sides, and are much more 
prominent towards the dorsal, than the ventral side. There are, also, two 
rows of rather small nodes on each side of the dorsum, placed on the costse ; 
those nearest the dorsum being more prominent than the others, which merely 
consist of a slight swelling of the ribs. 
Diameter across the curve 3-92 inches ; greater diameter, transverse section 
of larger limb 1-73 inch ; smaller diameter of do. 1-10 inch. 
We are unable to determine from this fragment whether it is an Anajloceras 
or a Hamite.

Ammonites cordiformis. 
Shell, when young, rather compressed, but becoming much more convex with 
age ; dorsum distinctly carinate, in small specimens, much more obtuse in the 
adult. Umbilicus one half to one third as broad as the outer whorl ; propor- 
tionally smaller in large than small individuals ; transverse section of the volu- 
tions distinctly cordate. Surface ornamented by numerous small costaj, which 
are largest near the umbilicus, where they sometimes (in the medium sized 
specimens) swell a little, so as to form obscure transversely elongated, subno- 
dose prominences. A short distance beyond this, they bifurcate regularly, or 
are increased by the implantation of others between, to two or three times their 
number, at the umbilicus. As they approach the dorsum, they curve distinctly 
forward, and in passing over it, impart to the dorsal carina, especially in young 
specimens, a more or less distinctly serrated outline : on the outer volutions of 
large individuals, the costae are almost entirely obsolete, 
The septa, which are not very closely crowded, are divided into five lobes on 
each side, the first four of which are similar in their mode of branching to those 
of A. cordatus of Sowerby ; but they are less deeply sinuous, and present other 
differences in their details. Greater diameter (of an imperfect specimen) 3-30 
inches ; transverse diameter of its outer whorl 1-90 inch : breadth of same 
from umbilicus to dorsum 1*64 inch. Breadth from umbilicus to dorsum of a 
portion of an outer volution of large individual 3-50 inches ; transverse diameter 
of same, near the umbilicus 3-18 inches. 
In many respect this shell is nearly related to the Liassic species A. cordatus^ 
of Sowerby, of which it may be regarded as a representative. All our specimens 
are internal casts. 
Locality and position. South west base of Black Hills, associated with the fore-

Ammonites henryi. 
Shell convex lenticular ; dorsum narrowly rounded, or subangular ; inner 
volutions entirely hidden : umbilicus very small and deep : surface apparently 
without nodes or costae. 
Septa not very profoundly lobed, rather closely crowded, slightly unsymme- 
trical on opposite sides of the shell. Dorsal lobe divided into four principal 
branches, the two terminal of which are smaller than the others, and usually 
tridigitate at their extremities ; while the two lateral divisions are bipartite, 
with more or less sharpely dentate extremities. 
The superior lateral lobe is about the size of the dorsal lobe, and irregularly 
divided into four nearly equal branches, one of which, on the dorsal side, is 
separated from the others by a deeper and broader sinus, than those by which 
they are divided ; while the. other three branches form together a kind of large 
tripartite division : each of the four branches is provided at the extremity with 
1858.]

from three to six sharp digitations. The next succeeding lobe is not more than 
one-fourth as large as the superior lateral lobe ; it is, on one side of the shell, 
divided nearly to its base, into two equal branches ; while the corresponding lobe 
on the other side, is narrower, and rather regularly divided into three short 
sharply digitate branches. The remaining lobes are very small, and simply 
digitate at their extremities. Greatest diameter 2-14 inches ; transverse diameter 
1-33 inches.

curving upwards a little, after which it bends backwards upon itself, so as to 
bring the aperture almost in contact with the inner coil; but leaving a free space 
within the curve. Inner whorls mostly hidden, forming a small coil at one end 
of the shell, and so closely rolled up as to leave but a very small umbilical im- 
pression : aperture nearly circular. Surface ornamented by rather small costae 
which pass round a little obliquely from the inner side of the whorls, to a point 
about halfway across the outsides, where they swell out into small obscure 
transversely elongated nodes, and then each branch into two or three smaller 
costse, which pass very regularly over the dorsum. 
The septa are moderately close, and provided with three lobes on each side, 
of which the superior lateral is the largest. The dorsal lobe is still larger, 
and provided with two small obscurely bilobale branches on each side. Greatest 
length .88 inch.; greatest height -60 inch ; breadth of the body whorl -32 inch. 
This species is very closely allied in the structure of its septa to S. hippocrepis^ 
DeKay, {S. Ciivieri, Morton, Synop. Org. Remains, pi. vii. fig. 1,) but differs 
in the details of its septa lobes, and the body whorl is proportionally much more 
slender, more cylindrical, and forms a larger curve ; it also wants the outer row 
of round nodes.

Belemnites census. 
Shell large and thick, subcylindrical, more or less compressed laterally, so as 
to give tlie cross section a slightly oval outline: lower portion tapering to a 
point, sometimes a little oblique, usually more compressed than any part above, 
often having a narrow obscure groove on the ventral side, and sometimes a very 
slight carina on the dorsal side, near the apex ; the groove being more frequently 
present than the carina, and extending further up from the point: surface 
smooth. 
Alveolus extending about half way down from the summit to the lower ex- 
tremity, where it terminates nearly midway between the centre and the ventral 
side ; from this point the apical line passes down, gradually approaching the 
ventral margin, but curving slightly so as not to intersect it before reaching the 
apex. 
Phragmacone conical, very slightly curved, apical angle 20Â° ; septa rather 
closely arranged, about twenty of them occurring in a section one inch in length, 
measuring -72 inch in diameter at the larger end, and .35 inch at the smaller 
end I siphuncle unknown. 
The best specimen we have seen, of the outer horny shell, measures 5 inches 
in length, and -90 inches in diameter at the larger end ; the alveolus measures

One specimen in Dr. Berlandiere's Collection, probably found on the Rio 
Grande : many others have been recently collected by Dr. W. A. Hammond, at 
Fort Riley, in Kansas. This species has the form, size and sculpture of G. 
Lecontei, and G. californica, but differs by the uniform pubescence of 
the elytra, the less sinuate sides of the thorax, and still more by the black 
antennae and feet.

San Diego, on the sea shore under Fucus giganteus. Although differing from 
the previously described species of the genus by the 9th joint of the antennae being 
nearly as broad as the tenth, I prefer that this and the following species should 
be placed here, rather than that the number of genera should be multiplied on 
characters of light weight. From the larger size of the insect, I have been able 
to investigate in a satisfactory manner the structure of the tarsi, and find them 
to be four-jointed ; the 3rd joint is however quite small, and closely attached 
to the fourth. On this account, as well as from the elongation of the fifth 
ventral segment, and the apparently close articulation of the anterior segments, 
I am disposed to remove Monotoma from tlie Lathridiidae to the Colydiidae, 
where it may form a group similar in value to the five others into which that 
family has been divided.

Colorado River, at Fort Yuma. The impressions towards the base of the 
thorax limit the dorsal smooth space, and are formed by the confluence of three 
or four punctures. The pygidium is larger and more prominent than in M. 
rufipenne, and is nearly horizontal. 
Closely allied, and belonging to the same genus is Rhizophagus c a p i t o 
Fairemaire, a species found in the Sandwich Islands. On comparison, 
however, it is seen that the punctures of the thorax are larger than in M. 
striatum, though also unequally distributed in rows ; the punctures and striae 
of the elytra are deeper, the red portion of the latter extends from the base 
for only one third the length, and finally the head thorax and under surface are 
black, with only the feet and and antennae red.

anterior part of the clypeus, but there is no intermediate elevated line, and 
the base of the thorax is broadly sinuate each side.

One specimen found at Ures, Sonora, by Dr. Webb. This has also nearly 
the same form and general characters as the two preceding, but the sculpture 
both above and beneath is much coarser. The tip of the 5tli ventral segment 
of the abdomen in them is broadly emarginate, with an acute elevated trans- 
verse line before the tip ; the lateral angles in one sex project in the form of 
teeth, while the outline in the other sex is simply sinuous. 
In the present species the line is not so acutely elevated, and beyond the 5th 
joint is seen a short punctured brown appendage, which is prolonged at the 
middle into an obtuse process. 
The antennal pores in this and in B. s p h e n i c u s Lec. which is strictly con- 
generic, are more numerous than in the two preceding, and occupy nearly the 
whole of the sides of the outer articulations ; the basal joint of the jDOSterior 
tarsi is also but little longer than the second.

A remarkable genus, which by its form and color recalls certain Gallerucites 
of the family Chrysomelinae, while the structure of the abdomen is equally 
suggestive of Psephenus. It seems by its general characters to belong properly 
among the Atopidae ; in which family, however, all the genera thus far de- 
scribed have but five ventral abdominal segments. The head is small ; the 
thorax is gradually narrowed in front, closely applied to the elytra, and 
slightly sinuate at base. The scutel is trilobed, with the middle lobe produced 
into a point. The elytra are wider than the thorax, oblong, rounded at the 
tip, coarsely but densely punctured. The legs are moderate ; the anterior 
tibiae are terminated by very short spurs, but I can see none on the middle or 
l)osterior tibiae. The anterior coxae are large, leaving only a very short pres- 
ternum, which extends between them, and abuts against the declivous mesos- 
ternum ; the metasternum is short and flat, forming an angle with the mesos- 
ternum, which widely separates the middle coxae ; the parapleurae are flat, 
broad, and project in front ; the posterior coxae are suddenly dilated inter- 
nally, truncate at tip, with the inner margin oblique ; their anterior margin 
is curved, with the concavity forwards, and the mesosternum is sculptured 
with a line parallel to this margin. The joints of the abdomen are nearly

Texas, at Eagle Pass and Ringgold Barracks, Mr. Schott. Resembles in color 
C. 4-signatus, but the elytra are much more densely punctured and with- 
out lustre. The posterior band is only a little paler than the ground color, 
and is only rendered obvious by the cinereous hair with which it is clotted : 
the space between the fasciae is partly dark rufous, while in C. 4-signatus it is 
entirely black.

form as P. bi color ilie/s. (which is probably the female of P. ruficornis 
Say, ) but it differs in the feet being of the same color as the body, while the 
antennae are not very obviously paler ; the more distinct posterior smooth 
dorsal space of the thorax, and the stronger punctures of the elytra also serve 
to distinguish it. P. thoracic us (Tomicus thoracicus Randall) has the 
thorax more uniformly roughened and sparsely granulate, while the dorsal

A genus closely allied to Upis, but of a more robust form, and differing by

This genus bears a very close relation to Lytta, and has very nearly the out- 
line of certain species (e. g. L. lemniscata) of that genus, except that the head 
is very much elevated, so that the vertex becomes conical, somewhat as in 
Rhipiphorus ; the eyes, moreover, instead of being transverse and emarginate 
as in all Lyttae, are longitudinal and oval ; the antennae are inserted between

the eyes, and the front is therefore narrowed at that point. The month is a 
little more elongated, bnt I observe no character worthy of mention in the oral 
oro-ans ; the labrum is rounded in front. The antennae are nearly as in L. 
lemniscata, but shorter, and with the joints less loosely articulated. The spurs 
of the posterior tibiae are equal and slender ; the ungues are double, but the 
inferior part is about one-third shorter than the upper, and is soldered to it, so 
as to form a large tooth, which does not descend abruptly as in Lytta erosa, 
but is rather as in L. elegans. The anterior femora are filiform and uniformly 
pubescent, having no trace of the slight inferior emargination and patch of 
sericeous hair seen in most species of Lytta.

black, with the outer edge pale. This species must be placed in Schonherr's 
second division near S. discolor, Mann., which by error has been described 
as having the third tarsal joint spongy beneath ; it is so only at the sides, and

One male from Sonora, Dr. Webb. Of the form of the male of M. d a s y s t o- 
m u s , but readily known by the thorax not being marked with bright facets 
separated by opake spaces, also by the posterior angles being obliquely but 
broadly emarginate, so that a prominent angle is formed before the base, and 
another at the base itself, and finally by the more slender mandibles having 
a strong tooth near the tip, and being only sparsely pilose internally. The 
under surface of the head is much more deeply excavated than in M. dasysto- 
mus, and the gular margins much more elevated ; the gense are broadly 
rounded with one subacute angle, while in the other they are emarginate.

species belongs to a group in which the anterior feet are widely separated, 
the presternum broadly and slightly produced posteriorly, and the mesoster- 
num suddenly declivous in front, thus exhibiting a tendency to Megaderus, 
which with the Trachyderides should immediately follow this group in a 
natural arrangement.

San Diego, California. Similar in appearance to C. incertus, but larger, 
and having the prosternum prominent in front. The striae of the elytra are 
<|uite as deep as in that species, but the interstices are less elevated : between 
the third and penultimate striae, which as usual unite around the apex, are 
four intermediate strise uniting by pairs ; in the space between the outer two, 
just behind the humerus, are two short strise each consisting of three or four 
points. The dark color on the elytra is seen in the punctures of the strise, at 
the tips of the loops formed by the strise, at the middle and base of the third 
and fifth intervals, on the humerus, and along the outer margin. When the 
under surface is dark colored, the sterna, the pleurse of the mesothorax, the 
middle of the base of the abdomen, and the last ventral segment are yellow : 
the pygidium is yellow, with large brown punctures ; the legs are yellow, the 
middle of the thighs and tibise being sometimes reddish, and the tarsi fuscous. 
* The under surface is almost glabrous and moderately punctured. Of the type 
were procured two males, and of the variety two females.

Colorado River, California, on Salix. This species belongs to the numerous 
group of indefinite species such as P. abdominalis, tridens, sobrinus, &c., but 
differs from the others by the paler color. The strise of the elytra are impressed 
only behind the middle ; the rows are regular, but closer than usual, and are 
confused towards the suture, where the elytra are irregularly and densely punc- 
tured. The middle of the disc of the thorax is usually marked with a large 
testaceous spot.

San Diego and Fort Yuma, California. The head has a vertical line and the 
occiput blackish. The paler parts of the thorax are less densely punctured, 
and in one specimen the dark spots are confluent forming an M shaped figure. 
The three internal strise of the elytra are contorted, and some of them are 
usually abbreviated, and behind the middle one of the intervals is usually 
broader, and more elevated : a few confused punctures are seen here and there, 
but the strise are not lost as in the preceding. The pygidium is yellow with 
three dark spots. This species greatly resembles P. abdominalis, but the dark 
spots of the thorax are more densely punctured, and the strise of the elytra 
are more sinuous.

no affinity, except that resulting from form. They are to be distinguished asi 
follows : 
Body glabrous, head not sculptured, antennae distant, slender, second jomt 
thicker, but shorter than the third ; thorax margined, angles not auriculatecl, 
beneath broadly lobed behind the eyes, presternum deflected and hollowed so 
as to protect tlie mouth when the head is bent down. Femora not toothed

Fifty-one members present. 
Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to some fossil remains on the 
table just received from Dr. Hayden. They are part of the Niobrara collection, 
and apparently indicate two additional species of the ancient Camel {Procarne- 
lus). One of the species is founded on the greater ]3ortion of one side of the 
lower jaw containing most of the molar teeth. Six molars form a closed row, 
of which the back four have about the same size and form as in the recent 
Camel. The second premolar is like the third one, and the first of the closed 
series has a laterally compressed conical crown with trenchant borders. The 
caniniform premolar has almost the same size, form and relative position as in 
the recent Camel ; and in the fossil, in a corresponding position, there is an 
equally large socket, as iu the latter, for a true canine. The jaw is shorter but 
deeper than in the Camel, and it appears to indicate that the species to which 
it belongs was about the size of the latter animal. The length of position oc- 
cupied by the closed row of six molars is six and a quarter inches ; the depth 
of the jaw below the middle of the last molar is two and a half inches, and 
below the first molar one and three-quarter inches. For this species the name 
of Procamelus robdstus is proposed. 
' he second additional species of this genus is indicated by several small 
fragments of an upper jaw with molar teeth, of an animal about the size of the 
Lama. The three premolars of the closed row occupy a position of fifteen lines 
in extent. For the species the name of Procamelus gracilis is proposed. 
Dr. Leidy added that he took the present opportunity to point out the 
admirable quality of bees-wax as a means of mending fractured fossils, and of 
increasing their strength when friable. If a fossil bone or shell have become 
quite brittle by the loss of its animal matter, and is dipped in melted wax 
and allowed to cool, it becomes nearly as hard as the specimen was in its 
1858.] 7

Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to a drawing of a curious 
worm, which he said was obtained from the Schuylkill river, and was inter- 
esting from its being more nearly allied to marine forms than any other known 
fresh water species. It lives in tubes of mud ; and is about a line in length. 
The body is divided into twelve annuli, including the head, which is cup- 
shaped, has two eyes, and supports on each side a process provided with 
seventeen cylindrical ciliated arms. The rings, except the head, are provided 
with four rows of bristles and two rows of podal hooks. The bristles are from 
four to six in a bunch ; those anteriorly having a falcate extremity, and those 
posteriorly being whip-like. The anterior hooks are in series of five ; and 
have a long handle with a lancet-like extremity. The posterior hooks are 
from fifteen to twenty in a series, and have a long handle with the extremity 
expanded and serrated on one side. It appears to be most nearly allied to the 
marine genus Fahricia. He proposed for it the name Manayunkia speciosa, 
from the Indian name of the river in which it was first discovered.

Mr. Lea remarked that when, a few evenings since. Dr. Leidy made some ob-

stone of Grwynedd, 20 miles north of Philadelphia, and which were collected 
and presented by him and some other members, some observations were made 
by Mr. Lea on the epoch of that mass of red and gray sandstone rocks and 
blackslates. This formation is now assuming greater importance, and the 
interest in it has recently much increased by discoveries made by Major Hawn 
in Kansas Territory ; descriptions of the fossil species, chiefly MoUusca, have 
been made by Messrs. Meek and Hayden and Prof. Swallow. No bones or foot 
prints have been observed by Major Hawn^ but all the specimens of MoUusca, 
&c., indicate without any doubt their belonging to some portion of the Permian 
Formation.

The importance of the discovery of these rocks in Kansas cannot fail to im- 
press our geologists, as the existence of any Permian in this country has been 
long and strenuously denied by nearly all the American geologists. Mr. Lea 
believed he was the first to suggest that the Red Saiidstone of Connecticut, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, &c., bearing foot marks and other impressions of animal 
and vegetable life, were of Permian origin and older than the Lias,* but not 
older than the " New Red Sandstone "f of Europe, as supposed by Elie de Beau- 
mont and Dr. Jackson ; and in the memoir which Mr. Lea then read before 
this Academy, describing the Ciepsi/saurus Pennsi/lvaniciis, of Upi:)er Milford, 
Pennsylvania, he stated, in regard to the formation in which these bones were 
imbedded, that he was ' ' inclined to place it among the superior strata of the 
Permian system. "J In 1834 Mr. R. C. Taylor considered the coal of the Lignites 
of Fredericksburg, Virginia to be "coeval with the Oolites." 
In 1836 Prof. H. D. Rogers stated that those red sandstones which he charac- 
terized as Middle Secondary Strata, " implied a date somewhere intermediate 
between that of the coal and that of the green sand ;"Â§ and afterwards with 
his brother, Prof. W. B. Rogers and Sir Charles Lyell, || he considered that part 
of this system which containes the coal near Richmond, Virginia, was " closely 
related to the earliest deposits of the Oolite formation of Great Britain ;" and 
he was disposed to add the whole of the red strata of his Middle Secondary Red 
Sandstone to these, and " assign them a position at or near the base of the great 
Jurassic system.""^ In 1839, Mr. Gesner in his Oeological Survey of the 
Province of New Brunswick, assigned the variegated Red Sandstone Rock of 
Saint Andrews, at the mouth of the St. Croix river, to the ' ' Bunter Sand- 
stone," the lowest member of the Triassic.** 
The late Mr. Redfield long since regarded the fossil fishes found in the Con- 
necticut sandstone as Triassic ; and a few years since he stated at the meeting 
of the American Association at Cincinnati, that this formation was character- 
ized by a flora and fauna as recent as the Trias. In this, Prof. Agassiz difi'ered 
from him, as he placed this formation at the base of the Liassic series. 
In a note, to a memoir on BatJo/gnatus borealis by Dr. Leidy,f f Mr. Dawson in 
reference to the older rocks of Prince Edward Island, says, " these beds may 
either belong to the top of the carboniferous system, or to an overlying deposit 
of the Permian or Triassic age, and in either case the red sandstones which 
conformably overlie them will be equivalent to the New Red of Western Nova 
Scotia and Connecticut, and probably Triassic or Permian." These views 
tend to confirm Mr. Lea's, published several years before ; and, subsequently 
Prof. Emmons, who thought in 1853, that the red sandstones of North Caro- 
lina belonged to the Trias, changed his views in 1856, and while confirming 
Mr. Lea's as regarded the existence of the Permian, divided the well marked 
beds of Deep River, in North CarolinaÂ§Â§ into Permian and Trias, with their inferior 
divisions stating their equivalency to the European systems, and he considers 
the Chatham series of North Carolina, the Newark series of New Jersey? and the 
Greenfield series of Connecticut Valley, to represent one epoch belonging to the 
Permian. The Gwynedd series and that of Phoenixville, being evidently of the 
same horizon with the above mentioned. Prof. Emmons agrees with Mr. Lea, 
in referring these rocks to the Permian epoch, identified as they are in North 
*Mr. Dawson, in Journ. Geological Soc, 1847, stated that the Red Sandstone of Prince 
Edward Island and Connecticut may be the same, and may be regarded as a post car- 
boniferous deposit of uncertain age.

Carolina by the same Saurian forms, plants, scales of fishes and the (so called 
mollusc) Posidonia. 
In 1855 Mr. Marcou published his " Carte Geologique des Etats-Unis," and 
in his explanations published at length, he gives an enormous extent on both 
sides of the Rocky Mountains to the Red Sandstone formation, which he dirides 
into four sections. As to the Red Sandstone of New Jersey, he places it on a 
horizon with the Aluschelkalk of Germany, the upper portion of the Triassic, 
(page 58.) 
Mr. Lea stated that his chief reasons in 1852 for attributing to these deposits 
a greater age than was given to them by other American geologists, arose from 
the fact that the vertebrae and teeth of the Clepsysaurus, which he then described, 
were very analogous the Thecodontosaurus antiquus, described by Riley and 
Stutsbury from the Magnesian limestone of Bristol, New England. 
More recently we have the opinion of Prof. Heer, of Zurich, distinguished for 
his knowledge of fossil plants and insects, who has examined specimens sent to 
him by Prof. Emmons. He states that these plants are characteristic of the 
Keuper, and that none of those of Virginia and North Carolina are really Oolitic. 
And it seems, too, that Sir Charles Lyeil, who has examined so carefully and 
frequently these red sandstone rocks in America, has changed his former 
opinions, and come to the conclusion that the Richmond and North Carolina 
coal series belong to the " Permian, or else to the Buuter sandstone.''* 
In a communication made by Prof. Emmons to the American Association of 
Science last August, he said that the question of the Permian age of the bitu- 
minous slates and lower sandstones of North Carolina must turn upon the age 
of the Bristol beds of England, the epoch of which is doubted by some English 
geologists. Mr. Lea wished it to be remembered that his conclusions in 1852 
were based on the almost universal opinion, in England, that the Bristol beds 
were Permian, and he referred the rocks in which were found his Clepsysaurns 
to the same horizon. 
Note. â On the southern side, the New Red Sandstone of Pennsylvania com-, 
mences on the river Delaware above Morrisville, opposite to Trenton, N. J., pass- 
ing near Willow Grove, below Norristown, Phoenixville and Ephrata, it crosses 
the Susquehanna at Bainbridge. On the northern side it commences at Kent- 
nerville, on the Delaware, about thirty miles above Morrisville, passing through 
Upper Milford township, it crosses the Schuylkill river about two miles below 
Reading, and passes out of the State at High Spire, above Middletown, the 
width here being reduced to about ten miles.

CoTYLASPis, Leidy. 
Body curved infnndibuliform, anteriorly cylindro-conical, posteriorly ex- 
panding into a subcircular or oval ventral disk with numerous acetabnla 
arranged in a triple series. Month infero-terminal, with a prominent lapper 
lip, and protractile into a cup- or disk-like acetabulum. Intestinal apparatus 
as in Aspidogaster. Eyes two, distinct, black, situated on each side of the 
head. Grenerative apertures inferior, between the head and ventral disk. 
CoTYLASPis msiGNis, Leidy. Proc. Nat. Sc. 1857, 18. 
Translucent white or pink white. Upper lip snout-like, conical. Ventral 
disk crenate at the margin ; acetabula 29, oblong quadrate, the outer rows 
continuous in front and behind so as to form a circle. Length from J to 1 line : 
ventral disk from ;i to |^ a line in diameter. 
Habitation. â Found adhering to the outer surface of the renal organ, and the 
upper margin of the foot, within the cleft of the upper branchial cavity of 
Anodonta Jiuviatilis and A. lacustris. 
Remarks. â This curious parasite, though allied to Aspidogaster conchicola, is 
certainly distinct ; and it never occupies the locality of the latter, which also 
is found in the pericardium of Anodonta Jiuviatilis and A. lacustris. It is an 
interesting fact that in accordance with its exterior position Cotylaspis pos- 
sesses well developed eyes, while the imprisoned Aspidogaster is hlind. It has 
occurred to me that perhaps these two genera may represent two different 
stages of existence of the same animal. 
Rhopalocerca tardigrada, Diesing. 
Attached to the mantle of Anodonta Jiuviatilis ; specimens also obtained by 
Mr. Lea from A. lacustr s. 
Heterostomum echinatum, Filippi. 
From oviduct of Paludina decisa. Quite common. 
Cercaria agilis, Leidy. 
Body, when elongated, narrowed pyriform ; when shortened, obcordate ; 
posteriorly emarginate ; anteriorly triangular. Mouth acetabuliform, large, 
globular. Acetabulum little larger than the mouth, nearly central in the 
shortened condition of the body, at the posterior third of the latter when 
elongated. Sporocerca as long as the body, long clavate, trans versely plicated - 
Color white. 
Exceedingly active ; found in the Delaware river, quite commonly in com- 
pany with Planorbis, Paludina, and Lymnea. 
DiPLOSTOMUM GRANDE, Diesing. 
Head oblong oval, a little oblique ; margin entire, inflated. Mouth small, 
round. Male aperture small, round ; female aperture large, prominent, longi- 
tudinally oval. Body conical. Ovaries dusky yellowish. Length 1 line : 
breadth \ line ; head | line long ; body | line long. 
Twenty specimens were obtained from the intestines of Strix nivea. 
MoNOSTOMUM AFFiNE, Leidy. 
Body spatulate, narrowest anteriorly, flat ; posterior end obtuse, with an 
excretory orifice communicating with a well marked canal traceable as far for- 
ward as the commencement of the oviduct. Mouth round, oral acetabulum

small, followed by a smaller pharyngeal bulb. Intestine simple, traceable 
on each side to the posterior end of the body. Testes four, posterior to the 
position of the distended oviducts. Ovaries finely lobulated, situated on each 
side external to the position of the intestine ; oviduct transversely tortuous 
and distended with brown ova. Penis ensheathed, long, tortuous, echinate. 
Generative aperture small, acetabuliform. Ova oval and prolonged at OBe 
pole, or sub-pyriform. Length of body 6^ lines ; breadth 1 line. 
Four specimens were obtained by Dr. J. M. Corse from the bile ducts and 
gall-bladder of the musk-rat {Fiber zibethicus.) Closely allied to M. hippo- 
crepis, Diesing, but has no trace of the horse-shoe-like collar to the head. 
MoNOSTOMUM SPATULATUM, Leidy. 
Body flat, oblong ovate, narrowing anteriorly, obtuse posteriorly ; color 
white, with brown tortuous lines indicating the course of the oviduct. Mouth 
acetabuliform, circular. Testes three,' alternating on each side posteriorly 
with the oviduct. Ovaries on each side finely lobulated. Grenerative aperture 
small, a short distance behind the mouth. Penis undistinguishable. Length

And were referred to Committees. 
Mr. Taylor stated that, at a meeting of the Academy, on the 16th of February, 
lie made a verbal communication, announcing the discovery of a probably new 
mineral in crystals, which had been brought from the cave of Las Piedras, 
Honduras, by his friend, Dr. John L. LeConte. By a qualitative analysis, he 
found it to be an anhydrous Sulphate of Potash, containing Ammonia. Prof, 
Dana, of New Haven, to whom he had sent two of the crystals, very kindly 
measured them, and found a difference in the angle of the trimetric prism suffi- 
cient to separate it from Glaserite, to which it was first referred. The differ- 
ence of angle being about in ratio to that existing between Barytes, Anhydrite. 
Celestine, Anglesite, &c., isomorphous anyhydrous sulphates. He hoped soon 
to show, by a quantitative analysis, that it is worthy of being considered 
u new species. He regretted very much that this preliminary notice, which is 
recorded in the rough minutes of the meeting referred to, should not liave ap- 
peared in the printed Proceedings for that month. 
Mr. Foulke asked the attention of the Academy to the fact that in 
the published Proceedings, under date of 16th February last, his name 
had been accidentally printed in connection with remarks which had 
never been made by him.

A communication was read from Dr. Isaac I. Hayes, announcing his 
desire to attempt a further exploration of the Arctic regions, and asking 
for such suggestions from the Academy as might assist in carrying out 
the project. 
Whereupon the following resolutions were adopted : 
Resolved^ That the Academy has heard with great interest the com- 
munication of Dr. Isaac I. Playes, of his purpose to attempt a further 
exploration of the Arctic regions. 
Resolved, That the Academy will hereafter give to Dr. Hayes such 
recommendations respecting the subjects proposed by him, as shall be 
deemed most likely to promote the objects of the Academy. 
Resolved, That a committee of seven be appointed to co-operate on 
behalf of the Academy with Dr. Hayes. 
The Committee was then appointed, as follows : Messrs. J. F. 
Frazer, T. B. Wilson, I. Lea, W. P. Foulke, J. L. LeConte, J. Leidy, 
and W. S. W. Ruschenberger ; subsequently, on motion, Messrs. E.

inches wide. Some of these had the soft parts, and he called attention to two 
fine specimens of Margaritana complanata, and Unio muUiplicatuSy both females, 
with the oviducts fully charged with embryonic shells, ready to be discharged 
by the parents. There were two important points he wished to be noticed.. 1st. 
The enormous quantity of young in the mass of the outer branchise of the 
Margaritana^ (the branchiae were 3 x H X ^- inches,) each specimen containing 
probably several millions of individuals. 2nd. That the Unio mulliplicatus was 
peculiar in having both lobes on both sides, charged with embryonic shells, con- 
taining no doubt several millions of individuals. This species of Unio is the 
only one Mr. Lea had ever observed furnished with oviducts in all the four leaver 
of the branchiae. It is very probable that half a dozen of these Mollusca would 
produce individuals equal in nnmber to the population of the whole United 
States.

Mr. Say describes S. ovalis as showing the interior apex from the base of the 
shell ; in other respects his description does not apply to this shell. Its aper- 
ture is nearer that of >S'. ovalis^ Gould non Say, but the peristome is much more 
flexuose, and the upper third of the shell becomes gradually attenuated, so as 
to give a sharp pointed appearance, though the spire itself is short. The re- 
volving lines are sometimes continuous over the whole body whorl, but gene- 
rally interrupted, or confined to the interstices of the incremental striae or 
wrinkles. It shares this peculiarity with S. concordialis, Gould, and S. lineata,

Shell broadly umbilicated ; orbicularly-depressed ; solid ; lightly decussated 
by incremental striae, and numerous fine spiral lines: color black or reddish 
brown, under the epidermis white and shining ; suture deeply impressed; spire 
depressed ; whorls 6, regularly increasing, the upper ones flattened, the last 
(jonvex, rounded below, and slightly deflected at the aperture; umbilicus broad, 
showing all the volutions clearly; aperture oblique, transversely-lunar ; in 
young specimens the decussated sculpturing of the shell on the parietal wall 
of the aperture is covered with a light callus as the animal grows, and ele- 
gantly marked with numerous fine, crowded, spiral lines ; in mature specimens 
this beautiful marking is entirely obliterated by the deposition of callus, but 
oa breaking the shell, the lines will be found to exist within ; peristome simple, 
acute, thickened within, ends slightly approximated, joined with a white 
callus. 
This species bears no close resemblance to any known American Helix. It 
belongs to the same group as H. Vancouver e7isis, Lea, but diff"ers in size, color, 
number of whorls, umbilicus, want of peculiar depression of the lip, by its 
beautifully decussated surface, and peculiar parietal wall of the aperture. I 
know of no species sharing this last beautiful peculiarity. In form alone, dead 
specimens may be compared with B. algira, Lin., of Europe, but the spire is 
flatter and umbilicus larger.

Bidscription of a Phyllostome Bat from California, in the Museum of the 
Smithsonian Institution, 
BY S. F. BAIRD. 
Macrotus Californicus Baird. California Leafed-nosed bat. 
The ears of this species are very large, scantily haired, ovate and rounded at 
the tip. Their outer edge extends forward to a little behind and below the 
eye ; the inner edge is partially free. The two ears are connected by a mem- 
brane, which takes its rise about one-twentieth of an inch behind the anterior 
free edge of the ear, and is united to the corresponding strip of membrane of 
the opposite side, so as to form a kind of roof over the middle of the head, 
the entrance posterior. The tragus is narrow, lanceolate, naked and one-third 
the height of the ear. The nasal appendage is short, but rather higher than 
wide, and extending on the side and beneath the nostrils as a narrow margin. 
It is coated rather closely with short hairs. The lower jaw is slightly fissured 
anteriorly, with a small narrow wart on each side of the fissure ; a groove or 
furrow extends from the fissure along each side the lower jaw.

The feet are entirely free ; the spur about as long : the membrane extending 
between the spurs is slightly concave, leaving the extremity of the tail free 
for the last joint, or for about one-sixth of its total length. The general color

nose, as well as in the widely different locality. 
It is to the genus Macrotus, of the subfamily Megadermata, that the first leaf- 
nosed bat ever positively known as an inhabitant of the United States belongs. 
It was discovered at Fort Yuma, California, by Major G-. H. Thomas, U. S. A. 
It is true that the Brachyphyllum cavernarum of the Phyllostomata has been 
given as occurring in South Carolina, but the statement has never been veri-

Memoranda of the eflPects of Carburetted Hydrogen Gas upon a collection of 
exotic Plants. 
BY GE#RGE W. FAHNESTOCK. 
During tbe prevalence of severe cold weather in the latter part of January, 
and first few days in February, 1857, the earth was frozen to an unusual depth. 
Beneath the stone pavements in the streets of Philadelphia, the frost penetrated 
to a depth of more than three feet. In the neighborhood of Arch and Eighteenth 
streets, and along both, those streets for the distance of nearly one hundred 
yards, the escape of gas from the main pipes under the street had been re- 
marked for several weeks. Leaks at the joints had probably existed for months, 
although, the porous nature of the soil had allowed the gas to diffuse itself, and 
find numerous vents at the surface. But the solid crust of frozen earth forced 
it to seek other channels of escape. 
At this time, with the thermometer ranging from zero to 10'' or 15^ Fahren- 
heit, a current of gas, penetrating the imperfectly secured joints of the main

pipes, made its way beneath, the eastern foundation wall of the greenhouse of 
B. A, Fahnestock, on the southwest corner of Arch and Eighteenth Streets.* 
When entering the houses on the morning of the first of February, the odor 
of gas was perceptible, which, on examination, was found issuing in a tolera- 
bly strong current through the ground near the north eastern corner of the 
greenhouse. It came up through a prepared border of soil between the wall 
of the house, and the flagging of the greenhouse floor. Although somewhat 
relieved by ventilation during the day, it was impossible to prevent its accumu- 
lation through the night ; and by the following morning the work of destruc- 
tion was accomplished. A choice and beautiful collection, numbering over 
three thousand plants, was, for the time being, almost utterly ruined. Many 
of the specimen plants were unique, and but rarely found in American collec- 
tions. The house, which a day or two before had given promise of an abundant 
succession of winter flowers, now presented the desolate appearance of tender 
vegetation after a severe frost. In some parts of the premises, scarcely a single 
plant retained a leaf or bud. By the universal difi"u3ion of this gas through 
the houses, many of the severest sufierers were those farthest removed from 
the point of its ingress. 
That the plants had been absorbing carburetted hydrogen for some time was 
evident from the fact, hitherto unaccountable to the gardener and ourselves, that 
they had been occasionally shedding buds and leaves. Had there been no 
plants in the house, the peculiar odor of gas would doubtless have been per- 
ceptible for some days before the accident. Its volume proved to be much 
greater than we at first supposed. Those plants placed upon or near the floor, 
or upon the lower tiers of staging, sufiered less than the taller specimens, or 
than such as were near the upper sash. This was especially the case with 
the Camellias, and other hardwooded plants. 
The full extent of the damage was not apparent at first. Many plants main- 
tained their fresh greenness without b'^coming shrivelled, or withering ; yet 
although seemingly in fine health, they shed every leaf at the slightest touch. 
Syringing was resorted to with the hope that the absorption of water might, 
in some degree, counteract, or neutralize the noxious effects of the gas ; but in 
most instances, the leaves and buds fell off when treated with gentle streams 
of water from a finely perforated syringe. 
As no plant sufi'ered unless in leaf at the time, it seems evident that the 
injury was eff"ected and sustained by absorption through the medium of the 
foliage alone. The volume of gas was too small to be absorbed to any extent 
by the earth, or roots of the plants. Bulbs, and other plants, dry and at rest, 
were distributed in considerable number through the houses, both upon the 
upper shelves and beneath the staging. 
A row of grape vines (not in leaf) stood against the eastern wall within the 
greenhouse, growing in a prepared border of earth under the table. The 
gaseous current passed directly through their roots. Saturated as the ground 
seems to have been with fresh gas, which was strongly manifest on taking up 
a handful of the earth, they do not appear to have sustained any injury there- 
by. A row of maple trees along the outer edge of the footwalk on Eighteenth 
street were also directly in the way of the current. They were not more than 
eight feet from the leaking pipes. Owing to the depth of frost it is probable 
that the flow of gas passed beneath their roots ; nevertheless the ground within 
a few feet was black with the " dead gas.'''' They sustained no apparent injury, 
* In order to convey as correct an idea as possible of the relative positions of theplaats 
v/ithin the houses, it may be proper to observe briefly that the greenhouse is one hundred 
feet iE length by twenty-five in breadth, runs north and south, and is substantially con- 
structed of brick, with a span roof of sash. The western side is also of glass from within 
tour feet of the ground. The span commences about eight feet from the floor, with the 
apex about seventeen feet in height. Included within the same range is the hot house, 
separated from the greenhouse by a sash partition, and communicating by two sash doors

put forth their leaves in the spring, and grew through the season with their 
usual vigor. 
As a general rule the hardwooded plants fared the worst. Succulents were 
the first to wither, and the first to recover. Large numbers of both hard and 
softwooded lost their tender twigs and young wood, which withered and re- 
quired pruning as far back as the sound growth. While some showed signs 
of life, and began to put forth leaves within a few weeks, others lingered for 
months ; some died after a sickly existence, and many were killed outright. 
Some plants near the leak, and under the full influence of the gas, manifested 
no apparent injury ; others in the remote orchid house were violently afiected, 
exhibiting an astonishing sensibility. It seems rather anomalous, that of the 
Orchidacese, whose sustenance is derived mainly from the atmosphere, every 
individual should have exhibited a total indiflerence to the gaseous influence. 
Several large specimens of Bletia Tankervillicea, as well as plants of Cypripedium 
venustum, and insigne, passed unscathed through the heat of the battle. 
That plants in general are peculiarly sensitive to this gas, even when it is 
almost consumed by combustion, seems to be well established. The experience 
of florists who supply blooming plants at entertainments, is, that the plants 
having been thus exposed are often in a sickly condition for some time there- 
after. This is especially the case with Camellias. They frequently shed their 
foliage, and have been known to die after an exposure of a few hours in rooms 
where many gas lights were burning. This has no doubt been caused in part 
by the heated and impure air arising from crowded assemblages, but, if so, 
similar effects would be alike apparent in Horticultural exhibitions when open 
only by daylight. 
No experiment similar to that which we are about to record has ever, to 
our knowledge, taken place upon so great a scale, or included within its range 
so large a number of genera. Solitary instances have been occasionally noted 
in which a limited number of species have been brought within the influence 
of acid and inflammable gases. Examples are not wanting, indeed, to confirm 
the destructive effects of carburetted hydrogen on vegetable organism. Many 
of the fine old elms in the streets of New Haven have been killed by leaks from 
the neighboring main gas pipes. Similar effects have been observed in Boston, 
Albany, and other cities in the United States. 
In a review of a paper entitled " Ueber Gasfabrikation und Gasheleuchtwig 
com sanitdtspolizeilichen StandpunJcte ; von Dr. Innhauser. ( Wien. Wochenhl. 35, 
1856,)" the author quotes the observation of M. Ulex, of Hamburg, as follows : 
In this city there are a great many linden and elm trees. In 1851, one hun- 
dred and fifty-nine of these trees had to be cut down because they had died. 
It was found that the bark immediately above the ground, often as far up as 
eight to ten feet, was quite loose, and completely separated from the wood ; the 
roots soft and red, the fibres of the roots soft and rotten. The interior of the 
trees were perfectly sound. This injurious effect upon the trees is not only 
caused by the gas which escapes unburnt in the flame, but more particularly 
by that gas which leaks through the pipes in the ground. It was sometimes 
perceived at a distance of fifteen to twenty-five paces from the pipes. The 
same observations were made in Paris, Bordeaux, Diisseldorf, Mannheim, 
Basle, and Vienna. Professor Bertulus, of Marseilles, thinks that the com- 
binations of sulphur and ammonia in the gas saturated the ground with hydro- 
sulphate of ammonium, which also causes the black color of the soil."* (See 
Schmidt's Jahrbucher der gesammten Medicine. Band. 96, 1857. No. II.) 
* Although not strictly within the range of the subject at present under consideration, 
it may not be out of place to remark that many instances are on record which show that 
vegetation has been seriously injured by acid gases from manufactories, especially in 
Belgium and Prussia. The same causes are said to have produced similar effects in a 
modified form in the vicinity of Philadelphia. This may account for the unusual mor- 
tality among the Liriodendron ttdipifera, and other indigenous forest trees, killed front 
8ime to time in Fenn Square, in the neighborhood of the United States Mint.

In reviewing these simple facts several questions naturally arise which, 
possess more than ordinary interest for the vegetable physiologist, and may 
lead one step towards eliciting new developments in the chemical organization 
of plants. 
Although no narrow nor definite limits can be drawn, still, the general char- 
acteristics tend to prove that a sympathy does often exist between genera of 
the same natural order. In glancing over the following memoranda of the 
effects of carburetted hydrogen gas upon each genus, this sympathy is fre- 
quently apparent throughout the various members of a family.* 
Without venturing on further comment or attempting more than a brief out- 
line, these facts are presented with the hope that the attention of chemists in 
their experiments upon vegetable organism may be directed towards further 
researches. It may be well enough to remark that the enumeration of the 
species under each genus was not deemed necessary. Wherever they were 
differently affected they have been so specified. 
The natural classification of Lindley's Vegetable Kingdom has been adopted 
in the arrangement which follows, and the remarks are as much condensed as 
practicable. 
In the Transactions of the Society for the encouragement of Industry in Prussia, (1857) 
is published an interesting extract from a report by Prof. Dr. E. L. Schubarth, of Berlin, to 
the Belgian government, " on the acid gases which escape from the manufactories of sul- 
phuric acid and of soda, and the means to render them innoxious." It seems that " numer- 
ous complaints of the farmers that the vapors from the chemical manufactories in Belgium 
injured the vegetation of the fields and gardens, induced the government (of Belgium,) 
to appoint a commission to examine this matter. This commission consisted of chemists, 
botanists and farmers. During the summer of 1855, the excitement among the people, 
who even ascribed the potato-rot to the influence of the chemical factories, had so much 
increased that several attacks were made upon the factories. The government, therefore, 
increased the number of the commissioners, and at the end of the year, they made a report 
which was published under the title " Fabriques de produits Rapport a M. le ministre de- 
i'lnterieure par la commission d'enquetre, Bruxelles, 1856." They say it was an admitted 
fact that vegetation is injured by the acid gases from chemical works, but this influence 
is often overrated ; the spots on the leaves, and injuries of the flowers ascribed to acid 
gases, are very frequently the result of other causes, as frost, microscopic, vegetable, and 
animal parasites, deposits of foreign matter upon the leaves, very intense sunlight, etc. 
The potato-rot is certainly neither caused nor increased by these gases. On the other 
hand, chemical investigations proved the presence of traces of hydrochloric acid in spotted 
leaves, and in the dew upon the plants. Similar spots could be artificially made by mois- 
tening the leaves with dilute hydrochloric acid, the presence of which could be proved 
after an interval of eight days. The report contains a list of trees injured by these gases ^ 
* Several chemists of high reputation have made examinations of the gas of the Phila- 
delphia Gas Works, but, from some cause, their results are at variance. In order to facili- 
tate the further researches of such as may desire to investigate its effects on vegetable 
organism, I insert the analysis of Dr. C, M. Wetherill, made in 1852, for the'engineer ot 
the Philadelphia Gas Works, This is probably as nearly correct as can at present be 
determined.

LYCOPODIACE^. 
Lycopodium were not visibly affected. Large plants of L. WUldenovii, L. 
ccesium arboreum, and L. umbrosum were within a short distance of the green- 
house door. 
Selaginella. About twelve species were in the orchid house, none of which 
were affected. 
POLYPODIACE^. 
In a collection embracing nearly one hundred and fifty species of foreign and 
tropical Ferns, and comprising many hundred seedlings within the pots of 
orchids and other plants, no special change was observable. In some instances 
they became slightly yellow in the fronds, but their growth and health were 
not affected. 
ENDOGENS. 
ARACEiE. 
Caladium. a fine plant of C. pictum was killed. It withered to the root at 
once, and never recovered. 
Philodendron was not affected. 
Dieffenbachia. a plant of Z). seguina picta was very slightly affected. 
PANDANACE^. 
Pandanus. Several fine specimens of P. Javanicus fol. variegat. in the hot- 
house were killed. The foliage became yellow, and withered, and the plants 
soon died. A plant of P. graminifolius, also in the hothouse, was much injured, 
lost a part of its leaves and recovered slowly. Several plants of P. Javanicus 
fol. vor. in the orchid house were not injured. 
PALMACE^. 
Ghamoerops Jmmilis became yellowish and sickly for some weeks, but did not 
lose its foliage, and gradually recovered, 
Ph(ENix dactylifera was not affected. 
BROMELIACEiE. 
Aechmea, Billbergia, Pitcairnia, Veiesia, Tillandsia, Dyckia, Melinonia, 
Pourretia, Puya. With the exception of Puya Altensteinii, which turned 
yellowish for a few weeks, no perceptible change was apparent in any of the 
Bromeliacese. A large number of individuals of this family were growing in 
the hot and orchid houses. 
H^MODORACE^, 
Barbacenia Rogierii was not sensibly affected. 
AMARYLLIDACEiE. 
Amaryllis, Brunsvigia, Crinum, H-s;manthus, Hymenocallis, Alsteomeria. 
The greater number of bulbs, being dry and at rest, were not affected. Such as 
were in leaf, including Crinum amabile, showed yellow leaves, but were not 
otherwise injured. 
Agave. Several specimens of A. Americana and A. variegata changed 
color. Their leaves turned yellowish, assuming a somewhat flaccid appearance. 
They recovered gradually through the spring. 
IRIDACE^. 
Dietes, Witsenia, were not affected. Ixia lost the flowers, 
MUSACE^. 
Heliconia angustifolia turned somewhat yellow, but soon recovered,

MusA. Some plants turned slightly yellow; the genus was very lightly 
affected. 
Stkelitzia regina passed through the ordeal without injury. 
ZINGIBERACEiE. 
Zingiber, dry and unaffected. Curcuma were not affected. K(empferia, not 
affected. Amomum, dry and not affected. Hedychium, not affected. Alpinia, 
not affected. 
None of the genera in this order were visibly injured. Some few were in 
leaf at the time, but the greater part were dry and not growing. 
MARANTACE^. 
Maranta. None of this genus were affected. 
Calathea zehrina was not injured. 
ORCHIDACE^. 
Bletia, Cypripedium. These two genera were the only plants of this order 
directly exposed to the influence of the gas. They were not injured ; nor could 
any effect be perceived in such orchids as happened to be in the hot house near 
the door of the orchid house. Of the collection within the orchid house not one 
exhibited any change. 
COMMELYNACEiE. 
Tradescantia discolor has spread itself for a distance of more than twenty 
feet beneath one of the side tables in the hot house. No visible effects were 
observable. 
ORONTIACE^. 
Calla turned slightly yellow. 
PoTHOS crassinervis was not visibly injured. 
LILIACE^. 
LiLiuM all turned yellow. Gloriosa, dry and unharmed. Agapanthus all 
turned yellow. 
Velthemiia viridiflora was in flower at the time. The leaves turned yellow, 
but the plant soon recovered. 
Aloe. None of the genus were affected. Ornithogalum, dry and unaffected.. 
Lachenalia tricolor lost all its leaves and flowers ; recovered slowly. 
Cordyline congesta was not injured.

MORACEiE. 
Ficus. A very large specimen of F. elastica was somewliat injured. A por- 
tion of the foliage dropped off, and the remaining leaves exhibited a yellowish, 
sickly appearance for several months. 
EUPHORBIACEiE. 
EuPHOEBiA jacquiniflora was powerfully affected. All the individual plants 
of this species lost every leaf and flower, and recovered very gradually. 
PoiNSETTiA pulcherrima was affected in the same manner ; not a leaf or 
hractea remained. 
Ckoton. All the species lost their foliage, taking the spring and nearly all 
summer to recover. 
BEGONIACE^. 
Begonia. All the plants of this genus, embracing many species, suffered in 
the loss of flowers, and a part of the foliage. They all recovered, however, in 
the course of a few w eek 
PASSIFLORACE^. 
Passiflora, were but slightly affected. 
Tacsonia, of several species, all lost their leaves and young twigs, but re- 
covered. 
CRASSULACE^. 
Crassula. This genus seemed peculiarly sensitive to the gaseous influence. 
They all withered down to the root at once, and were killed outright. 
RocHEA, were not visibly injured. 
TURNERACE^. 
TuRNERA elegans lost all its foliage, and recovered again. 
CISTACE^. 
OiSTUs. Every individual of this family was immediately affected. They 
shed all their foliage, and such as were in flower dropped their bloom : they 
all recovered. 
BRASSICACE^. 
Alyssum lost all their blossoms and foliage â recovered. 
RESEDACE.E. 
Reseda lost both leaves and flowers, and recovered. 
BYTTNERIACE^. 
Mahernia odorata, and varieties, were quick to lose all their leaves and 
flowers. They remained for some time to all appearances dead, but slowly 
recovered, with the loss of all the young wood. 
TROP^OLACE^. 
Trop^olum. Some fine specimens of T. azureum, T. tricolorum, T. Jarrettii, 
and other varieties were killed at once to the ground. Although a year has 
elapsed, they have not yet exhibited signs of vegetating, although still alive. 
MALVACEiE. 
Alth^a, Malva, Abutilon, Hibiscus. Every individual in this order lost its 
entire foliage and flowers. In those of the genus Abutilon, the young wood 
was killed. They all recovered after some weeks.

Sparmannia. A large old specimen of S. Africana lost all its leaves and 
flowers. It had to be cut back, and recovered slowly. 
TREMANDRACE^. 
Tetratheca Hugelii lost all its leaves â recovered slowly. 
Tremandra ericoides dropped both leaves and flower-buds â recovered 
slowly. 
POLYGALACE^. 
PoLYGALA oppositifolia, p. Dalmasiana, and others, were quick in feeling the 
deleterious influence of the gas. They lost all their leaves and flowers, had to 
be closely pruned, and were slow in regaining their strength. 
Muraltia Heisteria, quickly lost all its leaves and flowers ; it never recovered, 
but lingered a short time, and died. 
ACERACE^. 
Acer. A row of silver maples (A. dasycarpum,) planted along the pavement 
on Eighteenth street, stood directly in the way of the current of escaping gas. 
They vegetated as usual in the spring, and grew vigorously through the season. 
The depth of frozen earth enveloping their roots, caused the gas to flow beneath, 
without doing them any injury. 
MALPiaHIACE^. 
Malpighia coccigera was stripped of every leaf, but recovered. 
Stigmaphyllon ciliatum lost all its leaves, recovering slowly. 
TERNSTROMIACE^. 
Laplacea was powerfully afiected. It lost all its leaves, and after lingering 
awhile with feeble vitality, died. 
Camellia. These were in the full glory of bloom. About one hundred and 
twenty varieties were distributed through the green-house, embracing many 
large old plants upon the upper staging. In a day or two after the entrance of 
the gas, not a leaf, bud, flower, or wood-bud remained upon the largest and 
finest plants. The leaves did not shrivel, nor did they change color. At the 
slightest touch they fell off in showers. Those nearest the roof suffered most 
severely. A plant, which to an observer would seem to be in healthful vigor, 
would lose every vestige of greenness in a moment, upon being slightly shaken, 
and appear like a naked dead shrub. They had to be cut back extensively, 
some to the main stem, but the largest and noblest specimens were too much 
injured ever to put forth again. Others vegetated feebly, and revived slowly. 
The nurture of years will be requisite to restore them to their former condition 
and appearance. 
Thea viridis was affected in the same manner, but recovered more readily. 
CLUSIACE^. 
Mammea Americana lost all its leaves, and was so badly injured that it died.

VITACEiE. 
Cissus discolor, altliough far removed frcm tlie source of the mischief, was 
unusually sensitive. The whole plant withered, leaf, tendril, and branch, and 
was almost immediately killed. 
ViTis. A row of foreign grape vines, planted in a prepared border inside of the 
green-house, and trained up the wall and along the rafters, were not in leaf at 
the time. The gas passed directly through their masses of fibrous roots. On stoop- 
ing down, the strong odor of gas was encountered for some distance. This was 
more apparent on taking up handfuls of the fresh earth, which was unmistaka- 
bly foetid. Notwithstanding these facts, the vines vegetated early in the Spring, 
and grew vigorously, although they bore no fruit. As their roots lay directly 
within the gaseous influence, it is reasonable to attribute their preservation to 
their state of inaction at that time. 
PITTOSPORACE^. 
PiTTospoRUM. Large old specimens were considerably injured. They lost 
not only all their foliage, but the young wood. P. Mayii lost its leaves. They 
all recovered slowly. 
SoLLYA heterophylla lost all its foliage â recovered. 
EPACRIDACE^. 
Epackis. The collection embraced many new and rare varieties, some re- 
cently imported. Being in good health, the greater part were in bloom, but 
they were denuded of leaf and flower. Some died ; the majority struggled for 
life through the summer, and finally recovered. This genus was most severely 
injured. 
FRANCOACE^. 
Francoa sonchifolia lost all its foliage â recovered. 
ERICACEAE. 
Erica. They were somewhat slow in manifesting their injuries. No posi- 
tive change was apparent for some days, after which they shed their leaves. 
They have never recovered entirely, and some have died. 
Andromeda lost all the leaves and flowers, and recovered. 
Clethra were bared of every leaf, and had to be cut back ; they recovered 
shortly afterwards. 
Azalea. A large number of fine specimen plants, including about seventy 
hybrid varieties, were upon a latticed table immediately over the leak. They 
lost nearly all their foliage, and dropped their flower buds. A few lingered on 
and died, but the greater part recovered entirely. 
Rhododendron. Numerous large specimens, embracing many hybrids, were 
in difierent parts of the green-house. They did not show any change for some 
days, then gradually dropped their flower buds, and a portion of the foliage. 
They recovered gradually. 
AURANTIACE^. 
LiMONiA, Citrus. These plants were keenly sensitive. Large old specimens, 
growing in tubs on the upper platform, were stripped at once. The stage was 
covered with leaves, and oranges and lemons in all stages of growth, from fruit 
just formed to that fully matured. The tender wood was blackened and killed, 
so that they had to be cut back to the main branches. Attention, and careful 
nursing restored them somewhat, although they are very slow in recovering 
their former vigor.

Almeidea macropetala lost its foliage, and recovered. 
ZiERiA macrophylla lost all its foliage, was much affected, and recovered but 
slowly.

BoEONiA. All the members of this genus were considerably injured. They 
sustained the loss, not only of all their foliage and flower buds, but of the ten- 
der twigs. Ever since the accident they have been feeble and sickly, and it is 
not likely that they will ever recover. 
Eriostemon. Although they all lost leaves and flowers, and were entirely 
denuded, they were not long in recovering, and began to put forth new 
leaves in a short time. 
Crowea. They quickly lost every leaf, were considerably injured, and finally 
recovered. 
CoRREA. A fine collection of large specimen plants of this genus, were in the 
green-house, just opening into full bloom. Leaf and flower at once fell off ; 
they had to be pruned largely, and were long in showing signs of life. Many 
were too severely injured to recover, and died soon after the accident. 
Adenandra fragrans was killed outright. 
CoLEONEMA lost all the foliage, but gradually recovered. 
DrosMA dropped all their leaves immediately, and were slow in recruiting.

Pblaegonitjm. Several hundred choice plants were in training as specimens, 
and placed upon hanging shelves near the sash. The effect upon them was 
most powerful. It involved the entire loss of leaves and branches. They pre- 
sented the appearance of plants after being scalded or severely frozen, and of 
course were killed. 
PORTULACACE^. 
Oalandeina brevipes lost all its leaves, but recovered. 
THYMELACE^. 
Daphne. Numerous specimens of D. odora and D. Indica lost flowers and 
foliage entirely, since which time they have been sickly, and have not fully 
recovered. 
Pimelea spectabilis, a splendid plant, perhaps one of the finest specimens 
of its kind in the country, was ruined. It shed all its leaves and flower buds, 
but from its vigorous habit put forth again. After lingering a few months, it 
withered and died.

Acacia. About forty species were in the green-house, many of them large 
plants. They were covered with flower buds, and just coming into bloom. 
Not a leaf, bud, nor wood-bud remained. As a general thing, the young wood

no injury. 
Adamia. Of several varieties in the hot-house, all were greatly injured. 
They suffered, not only in the loss of their fohage, but in the wood also, which 
had to be closely cut back. Their recovery was slow. 
Bauera were also severely affected. They lost all their leaves immediately,

with j'-oung shells, which he then supposed to be peculiar to that species. 
Within a few days he had received from Cincinnati a number of species in a 
living state ; and he was surprised to find, in a fine female rubiginosus^ which he 
exhibited to the Academy, both leaves on both sides fully charged, the whole width, 
with sacks of ova of a deep rose color. These were not matured into the perfect 
shell, but each ovum was filled with red granulations, which gave a clear red tint 
to the whole of the four masses. On making an incision into the abdominal 
mass, he found the ovary fully charged with red eggs, which, passing out of the 
cut made by the scalpel, gave the appearance of arterial blood. The mass of 
the soft parts of this species is usually salmon-color or orange, but it is some- 
times white, and this female was of the latter color.

136 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
In the first place I would remark, that Mr. Girard's description of the color of 
the belly (yellowish) has doubtless arisen from his description being taken from 
the specimen as preserved in spirits, as it accorded with the coloring of my 
fish, which had been only two weeks in spirits ; whereas, when put in. they 
were bright silvery below the medial line and over the belly, as is the case 
with all the fish taken at the outlet of the Grand Lake, on the western branch 
of the St. Croix River, as I also found them many years since on this stream as 
well as the eastern branch, in the fall of the year. These fish are taken also 
in moderate quantities lower down the stream, but in the waters below Lewey's 
Island, which are of a darker color, and constantly filled with sawdust from 
the mills, the fish lose their silvery brightness and have the appearance of 
having been immersed in a yellowish dye ; these fish, too, are always in poor 
condition. In the young state, say from six to eight inches in length, they 
have almost invariably an irregular row of bright red spots placed along the 
medial line, some on one side, and some on the other. It was considered a 
very remarkable circumstance by the fishermen on the spot, that a fish so large 
as the smaller of these two should have the red spots, which this one had very 
distinctly before it was put in the spirits. 
It has been heretofore considered by those who were acquainted with this 
fish, that they were entirely confined to the waters of the St. Croix, including 
its two branches and their lakes, in fact confined almost entirely to the lakes 
and their outlets; and it is only on this trip that I have heard of specimens 
having, been taken, as a rarity, in three small lakes which empty into the lower 
St. Croix, and into the Passamaquoddy Bay. The fish described by Mr. Girard, 
as found in Union River,, would have but a short distance farther to travel in 
the salt water before entering that river. It is therefore pretty certain that 
they are, as far as yet known, confined to the waters of the St. Croix and 
streams of easy access therefrom by sea. They appear not to be known 
in New Brunswick, except in one of the small lakes alluded to, which empties 
its waters on that side of the river Mr. Perley is said to be unacquainted 
with the fish, except from report. I will mention another fact in regard to the 
Union River, which may throw some light on the history of this fish. I met 
accidently at Bangor with a gentleman of that place, an ardent sportsman, 
who told me he had caught in a small lake tributary to that river, a small 
.salmon ; that the waters of this lake had been dammed for saw mills about 
thirty years ago, shutting off as he supposed, the return of some salmon which 
had entered it for the purpose of spawning, and, that they had continue^ to 
breed there since, and had from want of access to the sea, deteriorated in size, 
and said also that several had been taken since. Now this gentleman had never 
seen the salmon trout (its universal name there,) of the St. Croix. Now taking 
into consideration that Agassiz has pronounced this fish the true Salmo Salar. 
which has at some former time, by some convulsion of nature, been shut up in 
these St. Croix Lakes, and only had the access to salt water restored by 
another geological change after the fish had been bred there so long as to lose 
its habits of migration, we need not be surprised that this gentleman should 
take this fish to be a small salmon. 
These fish, as taken, may be said to run from, one to five pounds in weight, 
as it is very rare to take fish of a size intermediate between the small fish with 
the red spots and those of the size of these specimens. I regret that I did not 
procure the small fish. I took a number of them at Lewey's Island, but could 
procure no spirits to preserve them, and after returning from Calais, I could 
catch none of the fish. 
As a game fish, affording fine sport to the fly fisher, I doubt whether it has 
its equal on this continent, with the exception of the true salmon. Its strength 
and agility are surprising ; when hooked it will frequently make a succession of 
leaps of two and three feet clear of the water. It is most readily taken with 
the fly in the most rapid waters above the dam at the foot of the Grand Lake, 
which has been made for the purpose of running logs. They are readily taken 
[June, 

NATURAL SCIENCES OI' PHILADELPHIA. 
137 
while the gates are up, but as soon as they are closed and the water becomes 
still, they decline the fly, but will still take the bait ; at this time it is necessary 
to fish below the dam, where there is still a very rapid current from leakage and 
overflow. The brook trout, S. fontinalis, is taken in the same waters, and in the 
stiller waters above, a large lake trout, there called the Togue, which differs 
from the Salmo confinis of the northern lakes, by having a more deeply forked 
tail like the -S^. siskewei of Lake Superior. 
Another striking characteristic in the history of this fish, is the remarkable 
development, in the male, of the point of the lower jaw, or chin, whereby it be- 
comes elongated and hooked, during and previous to the seasons of sexual con- 
nexion and spawning, which are simultaneous in fishes. This peculiarity, 
which, so far as I am aware, has been heretofore considered to belong to the 
type of the genus alone, the Salmo salar, adds much force to the theory of 
Mr. Agassiz to which I alluded before, (and I believe I am correctly informed 
that he has advanced such a theory). This fact, which I can vouch for from 
personal observation as well as other undeniable testimony, will show the 
necessity of a very close and searching examination of the structure and 
anatomy of this fish, comparing it with the true salmon, before its new name is 
confirmed. This sexual development, so strictly analogous to the swelling of the 
neck in the genus Cervus among quadrupeds, seems to point to further research 
among other species of the genus, that is to say, whether there is nut a similar 
development, though less marked, through the whole family, as at present ar- 
ranged, or if found wanting in that portion of the genus with very minute scales, 
whether it may not characterise that portion consisting of Salmo salar, this fish 
and all those having large scales. I was struck the other day in looking over 
the figures of Richardson's Troat of the Arctic Regions, that there was more 
than one with the projecting lower jaw. Were not these fish taken during the 
spawning season? And may they not have received another name in the nor- 
mal state ? Of course the facts at present known are too scanty to found a 
theory upon, but should this suggestion ultimately prove to have a foundation 
in fact, it would be sufficient to authorise a division of the genus. 
Dr. Morris mentioned in connection with this subject, that he had observed 
in the common brook trout {Salmo fontinalis) a similar elongation of the lower 
jaw in the spawning season.

Which was considered and adopted. 
Dr. Leidy, by permission of the Academy, communicated the fact, that 
about one half of the chrysalides of the canker-worm {Endalimia), which had 
recently proved so destructive to the foliage of our shade trees, were infected 
by two species of Ichneumon. One of the latter is comparatively large ; and a 
single individual occupies the body of a canker-worm chrysalis. The other 
species is minute ; and numerous individuals occupy the interior of a chrysalis,

BY F. T. HAYDENj M. D. 
Geologist to the Expedition. / 
In May of 1857, by permission of the War Department, I prepared and read 
before the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia, a few brief notes on 
the geological structure of the vast region drained by the Missouri River, with, 
a section showing the different formations from Fort Benton to the mouth, of 
the Platte. The geology, as far as it was known at that time, was represented 
by colors, on a topographical map constructed by Lieut. Warren. Since that 
time the expedition to the Black Hills under his command, has brought back 
many additional facts and much new material, which render a second edition 
of the map necessary, and enables me not only to add some geological for- 
mations, not previously known to exist in the West, but to enlarge to a considera- 
ble extent the boundaries of others. In my notes explanatory of the geologi- 
cal portion of the map, I shall endeavor, as far as possible, to avoid the repeti- 
tion of material already made known, through numerous publications, 
in connection with Mr. Meek. A much larger surface might have been 
colored on the map with a good degree of confidence, but I have preferred to 
confine myself, for the most part, to the results of my own observations in the 
field, leaving the blank portions to be filled up by future explorations. 
The rocks of Nebraska, as far as they are at present known, are referrible 
to the following geological systems : 
I. Metamorphosed azoic rocks, including clear granite. 
II. Lower Silurian. (Potsdam standstone.) 
III. Devonian? 
IV. Carboniferous. 
V. Permian. 
VI. Jurassic. 
VII. Cretaceous, Upper, Middle and Lower (including Wealden ?) 
VIII. Tertiary. 
IX. Post Pliocene or Quaternary.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
I. Granitic and Metamoephosed Azoic Rocks. . 
From the month of the Platte to Fort Laramie we meet with no indications 
of those disturbing influences from the subterranean forces which have wrought 
such changes in the physical features of the country in the vicinity of the 
mountain chains. But proceeding north and west from Fort Laramie, we soon 
find the different formations, older than the Tertiary, distorted and dipping at 
various angles. We observe, at first, a series of elevations in the form of 
isolated conical hills with rounded summits, varying from fifty to two hundred 
feet in height, for the most part, capped with Carboniferous limestones, which 
incline at various angles from 5*^ to 30Â°. Toward the main axis we find the 
elevations in the form of oblong ridges, frequently interrupted by narrow 
valleys, and presenting a full series of the formations known in this region, from 
the granite to the carboniferous limestones. 
Winding around these conical peaks and ridges are numerous streams of 
pure water, margined with birches, poplars, and other trees, of the same species 
as those found in far northern latitudes. Not unfrequently the valleys formed 
by these streams are of considerable width, with a soil composed of the debris 
of the granitic and metamorphic rocks which sustains a quite luxuriant growth 
of vegetation. Laramie Peak,* the highest elevation in the Laramie range of 
mountains, is composed mainly of a coarse red feldspathic granite, surrounded 
by a series of azoic strata composed of gneiss, hornblende, micaceous and 
clay slates and quartz more or less pure, standing vertical, and inclining 
against the older granitic rocks. Raw Hide Peak, which is alsout 1,000 feet 
high, is also composed principally of granite which has been protruded upward 
through the overlying rocks, while all around the base of the peak, in regular 
sequence outward, may be seen the different azoic strata in a nearly or quite 
vertical position. Proceeding northward from Fort Laramie, the granitic and 
metamorphosed rocks cease to appear after passing the head of the Niobrara 
river, and from thence to the Black Hills we observe only slight local distur- 
bances, sufiicient to expose the Cretaceous beds down to No. 1, but showing 
most conclusively that the same subterranean forces that elevated the Laramie 
Mountains, raised the Black Hills also. 
Arriving at the base of the Black Hills, we ascend by a series of stair-like 
ridges to the central or highest portion, and find that it is composed of a similar 
coarse red feldspathic granite as a nucleus, with a series of azoic strata resting 
against the granite. At the foot of the Black Hlls, Cretaceous bed No. 5 is but 
slightly disturbed ; dipping, perhaps, at an angle of 5Â°, and forming the first of 
a series of upheaved ridges which surround the principal axis. Passing over 
the first ridge we descend somewhat abruptly into a valley, and gradually ascend 
a second ridge, composed of Cretaceous beds Nos. 5 and 4, from eighty 
to one hundred feet in height, inclining at a still greater angle. The third 
ridge is formed of Nos. 4 and 3, and so on through all the different formations 
to the Potsdam sandstone, which is sometimes nearly vertical, and at others so 
elevated as to hold a nearly horizontal position. The granite of the Black 
Hills contains much more mica than that forming the nucleus of the Laramie 
Mountains, and might perhaps be more properly called a micaceous granite. 
The Black Hills furnish the only examples on our route of the outburst 
of trappean rocks. Stone Peak, on the north eastern side of the Black Hills, is 
an isolated protrusion, composed of every variety, from a most cellular or vesi- 
cular porphyritic lava, to a rather compact rock, which sounds under a blow of 
a hammer like clink-stone. The highest portion of the peak is composed of 
trap rock of greater age than that above described, very compact, contains 
much iron, and assumes the form of pentagonal columns very similar to those 
described in Dr. Owen's report as occurring around Lake Superior. Near Bear

Peak, on the north-eastern side of the Black Hills, is another example of the 
protrusion of these basaltic columns which are also five-sided, the sides vary- 
ing from eight to twenty inches in width. Some of the columns lie in a nearly 
horizontal position, the greater portion, however, inclining at an angle of 20^ 
to 40*^. Bear Peak is an outburst of porphyritic trappean rocks, specimens of 
which closely resemble the Tertiary lavas of the Pacific coast. All the Creta- 
ceous beds and all the Jurassic to the blue limestone E of vertical section* 
are upheaved around Bear Peak. 
From the foregoing examinations I am led to the conclusion, that the main 
body of the Black Hills and the Laramie range is composed of granite of very 
ancient date. That it is older than the oldest fossiliferous rooks is obvious from 
the fact that in both localities several hundred feet of stratified azoic rocks are 
interposed between it and the Potsdam sandstone. I am also of the opinion 
that the azoic strata overlying the granite on the eastern slope of the Rocky 
Mountains are similar in lithological characters, and hold the same geological 
position as the azoic rocks so largely developed around Lake Superior and in 
Canada. 
n. Lower Silueian Rocks â Potsdam Sandstone. 
The evidence of the existence of this formation in the region of the Rocky 
Mountains was ascertained, for the first time, in the summer of 1857, during 
Lt. Warren's Exploration of the Black Hills, as has already been shown in a 
paper read before the Acad. Nat. Sci., in March 1858. Its largest developement 
and only fossiliferous condition is found in the Black Hills, where by upheaval 
it is exposed in the form of a narrow belt or zone engirdling the azoic and 
granitic rocks which form the central axis of elevation. I observed no positive 
indications of this formation in the Laramie Mountains or at Raw Hide Peak, 
but in most places the Carboniferous strata rested unconformably upon the 
metamorphic rocks, except in a few localities, where a quartzose limestone 
which may be of Devonian ? age was interposed. But at the head of the 
Niobrara river, a series of horizontal beds were exposed, resting upon the verti- 
cal edges of the metamorphosed rocks, which from their lithological characters 
I have considered as belonging to the Potsdam sandstone. 
The following section will show the descending order of the beds. 
c. â A yellow and reddish yellow, heavy bedded, friable sandstone, composed 
of an aggregation of quartz grains, cemented by calcareous matter, 
sometimes becoming a conglomerate, consisting of rounded quartz 
pebbles, .......... 22 feet. 
h. â Fine compact, reddish clay slate, 5 feet. 
a. â Very nearly like bed c, only more compact and heavy bedded, of a light 
gray color, sometimes yellow with a reddish tinge, . . 37 feet 
A series of metamorphic vertical strata, consisting of gneiss with silvery 
mica in large plates, micaceous and talcose slates, white quartz, &c. 
Proceeding on our route northward, this formation was not again seen untii 
we arrived at the main axis of elevation of the Black Hills. Near our camp, of 
September 24th, on the southeastern side, I observed resting unconformably 
upon gneiss, hornblende, mica slate, &c., a variegated, gray and reddish gray 
quartzose sandstone filled with small plates of mica. Some parts of it were 
compact and silicious, others a coarse friable grit, and at this locality seldoiri 
becoming a conglomerate, but containing seams almost entirely composed of 
comminuted fragments of shells, cemented with a fine grit. The more 
compact masses contained some fossils that were quite well preserved, among 
which were species of Lingula, Oholus and Trilobites, similar to, or identi- 
cal with, those found in the Potsdam sandstone in other well known localities.

142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
The following section at this point may serve to render more clear the order of 
succession of the beds. 
c. â Yellow magnesian limestone, ...... 50 feet. 
h. â Yellowish gray arenaceus limestone, ..... 40 feet. 
a, â Potsdam sandstone, as described, . . . . 30 to 50 feet. 
Azoic rocks standing vertical. 
Beds h and c are Carboniferous and conformable to bed a. We continue to 
see this formation whenever we approach the central portion of the Black Hills, 
and in some localities the greater part assumes the character of a coarse con- 
glomerate composed of worn fragments from all the varieties of rocks beneath. 
Sometimes the lines of lamination are very irregular, as if the materials had 
been deposited by ocean currents. I observed this bed on the northeastern 
side of the Black Hills near Bear Peak, dipping at an angle of 20Â° to 30*^. 
Inasmuch as we have no paleontological evidence of the existence of this 
formation in the Rocky Mountain range, we must depend upon the somewhat 
uncertain data of lithological resemblance and position, for its geographical 
distribution. Prof. Hall, in Stansbury's Report, often describes a bed of sand- 
stone corresponding in its lithological characters and geological position to the 
Potsdam sandstone in the Black Hills. Stansbury's Island, (Grreat Salt Lake) 
the summit of which is three thousand feet in height, is capped with carbonif- 
erous limestone, which also rests upon a coarse sandstone and conglomerate. 
Again, north of Great Salt Lake City, the "limestone overlies a coarse sand- 
stone or conglomerate, which almost invariably accompanies it." "In several 
localities, as at Promontory Point, and near Mud Island, the metamorphic 
strata appear to be overlaid by a coarse conglomerate or coarse sandstone, 
which is partially altered and assumes the character of a quartz rock. ' ' Marcou, 
in the third volume of Pacific R. R. Reports, page 156, speaks of a sandstone 
occurring near the Aztec Mountains. He says : ' ' We travelled seven miles upon 
the granite, and on our right we found a cliff twelve hundred feet high. From 
the base to the middle we found the granite, then a band of red sandstone, 
(Devonian or Old Red.) Above this, the beds of limestone and gray sandstone, 
belonging to the mountain limestone." The following day "we travelled three 
miles on the granite, the remainder on the Old Red Sandstone." 
The diagram given, showing the order of the superposition of the different 
rocks, would apply equally well to the similar beds in the Black Hills. Many 
other less evident indications along the base of the Rocky Mountains might 
be cited from published Reports, but what has been said will be sufB.cient to 
show what we may hereafter expect with regard to its geographical distribution 
in the far west. 
III. Devonian? Formation. 
The evidence of the existence of the Devonian formation near the eastern 
slope of the Rocky Mountains, is, as yet, quite obscure. Owing to the meta- 
morphosed condition of the rocks, the fossils have been wholly obliterated, or 
only indistinct traces of them remain. About twelve miles west of Fort Lara- 
mie, the Platte river cuts through a series of strata three to four hundred feet 
in thickness, resting unconformably upon metamorphosed azoic rocks. The 
upper members of the series contain undoubted carboniferous fossils, which are 
sufficient to fix, with a good degree of precision, their age ; but resting upon 
the azoic rocks, is a very hard, compact quartzose limestone, evidently meta- 
morphosed to some extent, which, from its position and lithological character, 
I am disposed to refer to Devonian, though it maybe of Silurian age. On the 
Platte river, it holds a horizontal position for the most part, but in a few local- 
ities the underlying azoic rocks are thrust up through it, distorting it at every 
angle. About ten miles north of Fort Laramie, near Raw Hide Peak, it is again 
exposed, the strata being vertical, alternating with soft, dark, blue clay slate. 
I did not see any indications of it in the vicinity of Laramie Peak, or in the 
Black Hills. 
[June, 

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 
143 
In regard to tlie geographical distribution of the formation, very little can 
be said. Mr. Englemann, geologist to Lieut. Bryan's Expedition to the South 
Pass, often mentions a similar rock occurring at various localities between Fort 
Laramie and the South Pass.* Dr. Shumard, after an examination of some 
specimens placed in his hands by Mr. E., says : " The specimens from the meta- 
morphosed silicious strata, on the north side of Medicine Bow Butte, are 
Paleozoic types, belonging to the genera Spirifer, Chonetrs, Orthis, Orthoceras, 
Conocardium, &c. They were very badly preserved, and their specific charac- 
ters almost wholly obliterated. From their general appearance, however, I am 
strongly of the opinion that they represent the Devonian period, ' ' The evidence 
of its existence in the vicinity of Fort Laramie and other localities is so slight, 
that I have thought it not prudent to color any portion of the map as Devonian. 
IV. Carboniferous System. 
This system, as it is developed in the region of Fort Laramie, has been dis- 
cussed so fully by Mr. Meek, and the writer in our paper published in March 
last, that I need only refer to it in a very brief manner. The town of Desoto 
is the highest point known on the Missouri where these limestones are exposed. 
Ascending the valley of the Platte river, we find them quite well developed as 
far as the mouth of the Elkhorn, when they pass beneath the bed of the river, 
and the sandstone No. 1 occupies the country. Several small seams of coal 
have been found in these limestones at Belle vue and other localities ; and in the 
valley of the Platte, about ten miles above its mouth, I noticed a bed of very 
dark carbonaceous shale two feet in thickness, cropping out near the water's 
edge. This was considered by the inhabitants as a sufficient proof of the exist- 
ence of a workable bed of coal in the vicinity. The evidence now points to 
the conclusion, that, though these limestones belong to the true coal measures, 
they hold a position above the workable beds of coal, and that it is not proba- 
ble a valuable seam of coal will be found north of the southern line of Nebraska. 
A bed of coal, of inferior quality, has been wrought near Leavenworth City, 
Kansas Territory, but it holds a lower geological position than the limestones 
of the southern portion of Nebraska, the dip of the strata being toward the 
northwest. 
The exact position in the Carboniferous system, to which the limestones 
around Fort Laramie and in the Black Hills belong, is not sufficiently clear from 
the evidence yet obtained. They do not seem to be the equivalents of the beds 
above described along the Missouri, though they may be. The texture of the 
rock is quite unlike that of any of the limestones of the coal measures with 
which we are acquainted, and there seems to be an absence of the fossils char- 
acteristic of the coal measure limestones on the Missouri, and in northeastern 
Kansas. The latest opinion, however, of my associate, Mr. Meek, is, that they 
belong to the true coal measures. 
The following sections may serve to show the relations of the limestones at 
Port Laramie with those in the Black Hills. 
d. â Vertical section of carboniferous rocks near Fort Laramie. 
Yellow magnesian limestone, hard and rather granular in its structure ; 
contains several species Rhynconella, 50 feet.

smooth Terebratula, like T. subtileta, 4 feet.

P. semirettculatus, 30 to 40 feet.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
Vertical section of Carboniferous rocks in the Blade Hills. 
2. â Yellow magnesian limestone, rather hard and compact, passing down into 
a somewhat friable arenaceous limestone, underlaid by a bluish limestone, 
very hard, and containing a Productus like P. cora, and a Rhynconella. 
1. â Yellowish gray arenaceous limestone, with a reddish tinge, splitting into 
thin slabs parallel with the lines of stratification ; containing a Spirifer, per- 
haps identical with S. cameratus ; a Productus like P. cora ; corals, a 
Zaphrentis, Syringopora, &c. In the middle of this bed there is an eight 
foot layer of very hard compact bluish limestone, filled with comminuted 
crinoidal remains. 
The lower portion of bed (1) is the same as bed a of the Laramie section, and 
contains fossils at both localities which are similar to Lower Carboniferous 
types, along with some well marked Carboniferous species. In the Black Hills 
it contains a species of Euomphalus, resembling a species common in the 
Encrinital or Burlington limestone of the Lower Carboniferous series of the 
Western States, but perhaps distinct. 
Bed 2 includes beds a and 6, of the Laramie section, bed c being absent iji 
the Black Hills section. 
From the geological position, texture of the rocks, similarity, and in some 
cases identity of species of fossils, I think it quite certain that the limestones 
at Fort Laramie and in the Black Hills are the same as those so well devel- 
oped in the vicinity of Salt Lake, in Utah Territory. 
V. Permian Rocks. 
Although but a short period has elapsed since, through the collections of 
Maj. Hawn, the evidence of the existence of this system of rocks in the West 
has been given to the world, it has already been shown to occur over a wide 
geographical area. In addition to Maj. Hawn's discoveries in northeastern 
Kanzas, which were announced in February last, and the paper published 
March 2d, by Mr. Meek and the writer, Dr. Shumard stated, at a Meeting of 
the Academy of Natural Sciences, at St. Louis, March 8th, that he had been 
studying a group of fossils from a white limestone in the Guadalupe Mountains, 
of New Mexico, and arrived at the conclusion that they were of Permian age. 
He also says, that several of the species are identical with Permian forms from 
England and Russia; also identical with species obtained from the Permian 
rocks in Kanzas. It is now known to occur in a number of localities in the 
central portions of Kanzas also along the Missouri River and opposite the north- 
ern boundary of the State of Missouri, and the evidence is quite conclusive, 
that it is developed in the Black Hills. Many stray masses of compact silicious 
rock were found in and around the Black Hills, containing fossils identical with 
those described from Kanzas. This question has already been discussed in 
a former paper, and I have considered the two beds E and F of the Section as 
Permian, with a query, the evidence not being sufficient to establish its exist- 
ence with certainty. In a letter to the Academy of Sciences at St. Louis, dated 
March 31st, Dr. Norwood announced the discovery of Permian fossils in Illinois, 
and at the Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science 
at Baltimore, Mr. A. H. Worthen, State Geologist of Illinois, read a paper on the 
Permian rocks of that State, and exhibited a fine collection of fossils, which 
he considered as belonging to that system. We have, therefore, reliable evi- 
dence of the existence of these rocks in Kanzas, Nebraska, New Mexico and 
Illinois, and future investigations will, I think, prove them well developed in 
Missouri and other Western States.f 
* I have endeavored to represent this formation on the map, in Kansas, from 
information derived from Major Hawn's explorations. 
fin our remarks of the 2d of March, upon the discovery of supposed 
Permian rocks in the West, both Mr. Meek and myself wish to be understood 
as referring to their existence in Kanzas and Nebraska. Our object being 
simply to announce our conclusions derived from the study of fossils col-

lected from these rocks in the West, we did not refer to their supposed prior 
discovery in Pennsylvania and on the Atlantic coast, nor were we able to judge 
of the evidence of their existence in those localities, it being based, for the 
most part, upon the remains of Vertebrata, which are out of our line of inves- 
tigation. We also merely wished to announce the existence in the West of 
rocks which were on a parallel with the so-called Permian system of Europe.; 
without touching the great question whether or not there is actually a Permiar: 
system distinct from the Carboniferous. 
VI. Jurassic System. 
The Black Hills has, up to this time, afforded the most satisfactory evidence 
of the existence of this system in the West. It is there brought to the surface 
by the upheaval of the older rocks in the form of a belt or zone, five to fifteen 
miles in width, engirdling the principal axis of elevation. None of the organic 
remains already discovered, which are quite numerous in species, are known to 
be positively identical with those found in the same system in the old world, but 
they belong to the same genera, and many of the species are so closely allied to 
forms characteristic of the Jura of Europe, that we cannot now hesitate to admit 
this system into our series. I will here repeat the palaeontological evidence, 
which was read before the Academy in March last by Mr, Meek and myself, 
with such additional proof as we have been able to secure by our investigation 
of the undescribed fossils in the collection, up to the present time. 
1st. Pentacrinus asierisc7is,n. sp.,is so nearly like the Liassic P. scalaris, Gold- 
fuss, that it is with some hesitation we have regarded it as new. 
2d. Avicula (Monotis) tenuicosta, n. sp., is very closely related to M. suhstriata, 
of Munster, from the Lias. 
3d. Area {CucuUcea) inornaia^ n. sp., is very similar to G. Mumteri- (Zeiten,) 
also from the Lias. 
4th. Panopoea {Myacites) subellipiica, n. sp., is similar to the Liassic forms 
M. liasensis and M. Alduinimts, of Quensled. 
5th. Ammonites cordiformis, n. sp., is the same type as the Oolitic species 
A. cordatus, (Sowerby). 
6th. Belemnites densus, n. sp., is scarcely distinguishable from the Oolitic 
species B. ecceniricus, Biainville, if, indeed, it is really distinct. 
We have, also, in the collection from the Black Hills, a species of Hettangia, 
a genus not known to occur in the old world in formations newer than the Lias, 
and a Trigonia more nearly resembling Jurassic types than those of any other 
formation. 
Although it is not yet known to occupy a large geographical area in this 
country, we have indications that it will be found extensively developed ou. 
the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, from the northern part of British 
America to New Mexico. That it exists toward the head waters of the. 
Yellow Stone, around Panther and Big Horn Mountains, I cannot doubt. 
In the summer of 1854, while exploring the valley of the Yellowstone, a^- 
far as the mouth of the Big Horn River, 1 received, from intelligent traders, 
masses of gypsum precisely like that characterizing the Jurassic beds in the 
Black Hills. 
VII. Cretaceous System,* â Upper, Middle and Lower (including the 
Wbaldbn ?) 
The beds of sandstone impure lignite, &c., which we have hitherto dp- 
scribed as resting upon the Upper Carboniferous limestones, near Council 
*In a paper recently published by Maj. F. Hawn, in the St. Louis Acad. Sci , I observe 
he refers the whole of formation INo. 1 of the Nebraska section to the Trias; and alludes 
to the fact that Mr. Meek and I had referred it to the Lower Cretaceous. He also states, 
that he found in some of the lower beds included by us in this series in Kanzas, fosssif 
indicating relations rather to the Permian below than the Cretaceous above. 
In justice to Mr. Meek and myself, I would state, that these lower beds in Kanza?

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 
Bluflfs, and extending above the mouth of the Big Sioux River, have, until 
recently, been considered of doubtful geological age, on account of the 
paucity of their organic remains. The discovery, during the past year, at Black- 
bird Hills, of dicotyledonous leaves in this formation, allied to the oaks, 
willows, and others of our deciduous forest trees, together with their position 
with regard to other well-known Cretaceous formations, renders the evidence 
quite clear that a large portion of the strata which we have included in 
No. 1 of our vertical section, are of Lower Cretaceous age."^" In ascending the 
Platte Valley, No. 1 is first observed five miles above the mouth of that 
river in the form of an outlier, resting upon the Carboniferous limestone and 
gradually increasing in thickness to the mouth of the Elkhorn; it then covers 
the surface of the country as far as Beaver Creek, a branch of Loup Fork. We 
have already mentioned its exposure by elevation in the valley of Old Woman's 
Creek; and it also forms a belt around the Black Hills, presenting its usually 
variable lithological characters, and for the most part destitute of fossils. No. 
2, 3, 4 and 5 also occur in their order of sequence outward from the Black 
Hills, as is shown by colors on the map. We have therefore arrived at the 
conclusion, that No. 1, as it is revealed from Council BlufFs to the Big Sioux, 
is Lower Cretaceous ; although two or three beds of yellow and ash-colored 
clays, exposed at low water, near Blackbird Hills, may be Upper Jurassic, no 
organic remains having been found in them to fix with certainty their age. 
We also consider a large portion of No. 1 ?, as seen at the mouth of the Judith, 
Lower Cretaceous, though some of the beds are probably Jurassic. Should 
the Jurassic system be found to exist in the Judith country, of which fact 
there is room for very little doubt, we may look for a large development of it 
in the Great Lignite basin, which stretches northward toward the Arctic Sea. 
The discovery during the past year in the Black Hills, of beds containing 
fresh water fossils of the genera Unio, Planorbis, Paludina, &c., in the lower 
portion of Cretaceous formation No. 1, or the upper part of the Jurassic, 
points to the conclusion that there probably are deposits in the West equivalent 
to those of the Wealden of Europe. The existence of this formation in the 
West, was first suggested by Dr. Leidy after an examination of some Saurian 
rem ains discovered by me near the mouth of the Judith river, in the summer of 
1855. At that time the evidence seemed to be conflicting in its character, the 
Mollusc ous fossils appearing more closely allied to Tertiary forms, while the 
Verteb rate remains were related to those of the Wealden periods. 
The fact that several species of shells from the Estuary beds of the Judith 
were included in No. 1 by us, solely on the strength of information furnished by Maj. 
Hawn, who had informed us that he had found in these beds, or rather in still lower 
beds. Ammonites^, Baculites, Ancylocercs, Copiinella, Inoceramus, ^c, an association of 
fossils never met with in older rocks than the lowest Cretaceous. The fossils, however, 
sent us from these lowest beds by Maj. Hawn, proved, on examination, to belong to quite 
distinct genera from those to which he had referred them ; being all Peimian and Carboni- 
ferous types. Unfortunately, they did not come to hand until after our paper was pub- 
lished. 
That the higher beds constituting the type of our No. 1, as seen near the mouth of the 
Big Sioux, on the Missouri, containing numerous well-preserved leaves of unquestionable 
dicotyledonous trees, apparently belonging to the genera Quercvs, Salix, &c., and closely 
resembling existing species of those genera, cannot be Triassic, or even Jurassic, will, 
of course, be understood by geologists. Although we have as yet no conclusive, 
palseontological evidence that any portion of the beds we have provisfionally included 
in No. 1, in the region of the Judith River is Jurassic, still I am inclined to think that some 
of the beds of this system are there exposed by upheaval in several localities. While ex- 
ploring this wild, rugged country in the summer of 1855, 1 often noticed a series of non- 
fossihferous variegated beds of clays and grits, thrust up from beneath the fossiliferus sand- 
stones, which we have called No. 1 ?, with the same lithological characters as the Jurassic 
strata, developed in the Black Hills. I have httle doubt, that they are exposed around 
Little Rocky, Snowy and Girdle Mountains in the same manner as about the Black 
Hills. 
*Maj. Hawn also found the same or similar leaves in this formation in Kansas.

were so closely related to forms occurring in the Great Lignite Basin, which we 
knew to be Tertiary beyond a doubt, that there was a question whether 
they were not specifically identical ; also that a species of Ostrea found in the 
upper Judith beds could not be distinguished from a species observed in 
the lowest bed of the Lignite Basin, and a species of Trionyx was con- 
sidered by Dr. Leidy common to the two deposits, led both Mr. Meek and myself 
to express the opinion that the Judith beds were probably Tertiary, and were on 
a parallel with the lowest beds of the great Lignite Basin. Other facts have 
now been brought to light which lead us rather to suspect that the suggestion 
first made by Dr. Leidy, that Judith River beds, or at any rate a portion of those 
containing the estuary fossils, as well as those occurring in the Black Hills, may 
be the American representatives of the Wealden of England. On the map I have 
not distinguished the Wealden deposits by a separate color, but included them 
with Lower Cretaceous formation No. 1. 
From the evidence thus far obtained in regard to the Laramie Mountains 
and the Black Hills, I have inferred that there have been the following 
oscillations of the surface of the country in this region. In the first place, 
after the deposition of the azoic strata, there was an upheaval of the granitic 
rocks, which threw into a highly inclined position these older strata. If this 
upheaval elevated the old azoic strata above the ocean level, there must have 
been a subsequent subsidence, after which the Potsdam Sandstone was depos- 
ited. Then there was a later elevation that raised the Potsdam Sandstone 
above the surface of the ancient sea, which was followed by a long period of 
repose, sufficient for the deposition of all the formations from the Potsdam to 
the Upper Carboniferous, when there was another subsidence followed by the 
deposition of the formations of the Upper Carboniferous, Permian, (possibly the 
Triassic,) Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. After all these disturbances, and 
probably at the same time that most of our continent was raised above the 
ocean level, the whole of these strata were again elevated to nearly their 
present position previous to the dawn of the Tertiary period. 
What changes may have occurred in the physical features of the country 
during the long period which must have elapsed between the deposition of 
the Lower Silurian and the Carboniferous rock, it is impoÂ»sible now to deter- 
mine. We know that in our present seas there is a constant deposition of 
sediment going on, forming sandstones, &c., or a calcareous precipitation form- 
ing limestones. In order to account for the hiatus between the Potsdam 
sandstone and the Carboniferous rocks in this region, we must suppose that 
i^ither the surface occupied by the former was above the waters during this 
long interval, or that the intervening formations were deposited and subse- 
quently removed by erosion and denudation, prior to the Carboniferous era. It 
seems quite improbable that so great thickness of strata could have been re- 
moved, so as to leave no trace of their former existence over so large an areao.. 
We are, therefore, inclined to the opinion that they were never deposited 
this region. 
VIII. Tertiary Basins of the Upper Missouri. 
Our present knowledge of the geological formations of the far west, leads me 
to modify, to some extent, the divisions of the Tertiary Basins given in my 
notes explanatory of the first edition of the geological map of Nebraska, pub- 
lished in May, 1857. Considering the fresh water and estuary deposits at the 
mouth of the Judith as probably the equivalents of the Wealden of Europe, , 
we have the following subdivisions : 
1st. Grreat Lignite Tertiary Basin. 
3nd. White River Tertiary Basin. 
IsL Great Lignite Tertiary Basin, 
As this formation, in its extensive development on the Upper Missouri, has 
been described quite fully in several preceding papers, I will here simply

notice its occurrence in tlie only locality where it was observed during tlie 
explorations of the past year, near the source of the South Fork of the Shyenne 
river. It here rests conformably upon Cretaceous bed No. 5, and in no place 
exhibits any indications of having been disturbed by the subterranean forces 
which have wrought such changes in the physical features of this region. The 
following section will represent the descending order of the beds as seen at this 
locality : 
â¬. â Yellow arenaceous bed, holding the same position, I think, as the one at 
Fort Clark, which contains numerous fresh water shells. 
d. â Light gray grit, with numerous iron-rust concretions, same bed, seen on 
Cherry Creek, Fort Clark, on the Missouri above Fort Union, and on the 
Yellow Stone, 20 to 30 feet. 
c. â Very impure Lignite, . . . . . . , 4 to 6 feet. 
h. â Dark ash colored clay passing up into the Lignite, ... 20 feet. 
a. â Fine yellow sand : about 6 feet exposed. 
By reference to the colored map, the boundaries of this great basin will 
once be seen north and east of the Black Hills. It will also be seen that mj 
former explorations show its full development on the Yellowstone, as high uP 
as the mouth of the Big Horn river. It will then appear probable that its 
existence on the South Pork of the Shyenne indicates its extension from the 
Yellowstone, along the western base of the Black Hills, and that it adapts itself 
to the rugged features of the country, caused by the upheaval of the older 
formations, in the same manner as the Miocene Tertiary near Raw-Hide Peak 
and Laramie Peaks. 
2d. Tertiary Basin of White and Niobrara Rivers. 
In St, former paper* I gave a vertical section of the different beds of this 
basin as far as they were known at that time. During the past year, many 
Additional fa-cts, and a large collection of new organic remains have been 
secured, which enable me to present a section more accurate and complete. 
It will be at once apparent from the list of localities for the different beds, how 
extensive a geographical area this basin occupies.

By reference to the map it will be seen that our route, which is indicated by 
a dotted line, led us up the Loup Fork of the Platte river to its source, thence 
a little west of North to the Niobrara river, and up the latter river to Fort 
Laramie. From Fort Laramie we proceeded nearly north to the Black Hills, 
and, on our return, crossed the Shyenne and White rivers, striking the Niobrara 
again above the mouth of Little Rapid river. We then passed down the Niobrara 
to its entrance into the Missouri river. Inasmuch as the surface deposit ot 
the greater portion of the country thus passed over, is composed of the different 
beds of the Tertiary basin of which I am now treating. I think I can show more 
clearly the geographical area of this formation and that of its subdivisions, 
also the changes in the lithological characters, by giving- a brief digest of my 
journal as we proceeded from point to point. 
Ascending the Loup Fork, the first indication we observed of this formation 
was near the old Pawnee village, about eight miles above the mouth of Beaver 
creek. Here we found, near the bed of the river, large masses of pebbly con- 
glomerate, cemented with a calcareous grit, which undoubtedly belongs to bed

^ of the vertical section. The distant hills, on either side of the river, are 
covered with a considerable thickness of Pliocene and Post Pliocene beds. 
Near the mouth of North Branch the following section of the strata, in' de- 
scending order, were observed : 
d. â Yellowish brown laminated argillaceous grit ; effervesces briskly with muri- 
atic acid. - 
c. â Similar to the bed above, but of a deeper color, more compact, containing 
a greater per cent, of clay, with numerous calcareous concretions dis- 
seminated through it, ----- - 70 to 100 feet. 
b. â Light brown clay, filled with fine whitish particles like magnesia. 70 feet. 
a. â Gray, coarse sand, forming a heavy bedded sandstone, reaches 
to the waters edge, - - 30 feet. 
In the upper beds of the above local section, fragments of Mammalian and 
Chelonian remains were found, and all but the lower bed, which is bed E of the 
vertical section, are Pliocene. Lt. Warren explored the North Branch thirty 
miles above its mouth, and met with a similar series of beds, containingthe same 
organic remains. Above the mouth of North Branch, bed a of the local section 
appears, in the form of large ledges of light gray arenaceous limestone, filled with 
silicified tubes like the stems of plants, and seeds resembling cherry stones 
In the Pliocene beds, on the distant hills, when exposed by erosion, I found 
numerous fragments of bones and teeth of Hipparion, Cervus, &c. 
About Ion. 99Â° we enter the desolate region of the Sand Hills. I measured the 
heighth of these hills at one locality and found them to be two hundred and 
thirty feet above the bed of Loup Fork, and composed of Pliocene beds as a 
base, then a thin bed of Post Pliocene marl, overlaid by a great thickness of 
loose incoherent sand and gravel, derived from the erosion of the different Ter- 
tiary beds. The whole country from the head of Loup Fork presents a similar 
character, consisting of movable sand hills, the true Tertiary beds being very 
seldom exposed. On the South Branch, the stream cuts though the following 
Pliocene strata. 
c â Yellowish brown grit, containing Ilastodon micificus^ (Leidy.) 
b â White chalky stratum, charged with fresh water and land shells of the 
genera Helix, Flanorbis, Limnea, &c., probably identical with recent 
species, __________ 3 feet. 
a â Heavy bedded gray sandstone, - - - - - 8 tO 10 feet. 
From the head of Loup Fork to the Niobrara river the whole country is 
covered with this superficial deposit of sand, which is blown by the wind into 
ridges and high conical hills, rendering travelling quite difficult. On reaching 
the Niobrara we find bed E quite well developed, also a full series of the Pliocene 
beds filled with Mammalian remains. Passing up the Niobrara about fifty miles, 
the Pliocene strata gradually disappear, and the whole country is occupied by 
the Upper Miocene beds U and D. A Butte near this point affords a fine detailed 
section of the gray sandstone bed which, measured from the base, with a 
pocket level, I found to be one hundred and sixty-six feet in heighth. It is 
composed mostly of a gray coarse grit, sometimes quite incoherent, containing 
many layers of concretionary sandstone. On the summit is a thin bed of 
shelving limestone similar to that containing organic remains at Pinau's spring, 
though probably not holding the same geological position. Indistinct traces 
of freshwater shells and numerous remains of fishes, scales, vertebrae, &c., 
were visible in the tabular masses. It seems to form the upper portion of 
bed E, and to vary much in its character in different localities. It presents 
every variety from a translucent chalcedony to a fine grained sandstone or com- 
pact limestone, and furnishes those chalcedonic masses which meet the eye of 
the traveller so often and have the appearance of erratic blocks. Farther from 
the river, and holding a higher position than the summit of the Butte, are thin 
beds of yellow and yellowish gray calcareous grit undoubtedly of Pliocene 
age, containing numerous fragments of teeth and finely preserved bones of the 
Uastodon and Elephant. As we pass up the river the gray sandstone bed E 
presents a great variety of lithological characters. Sometimes it forms a coarse

conglomerate, then an aggregate of grains of quartz cemented by calcareous 
matter. 
About sixty miles above the point where we struck the Niobrara, bed i), of 
the vertical section, is revealed to the water's edge. The dip of the strata 
towards the east gradually brings this bed to view quite conspicuously. It is 
composed of a flesh colored calcareous grit, and the eroded material of this bed 
gives to the country a dull reddish yellow tint. It also contains many layers 
of silico-calcareous concretions, forming large ledges which break into irregu- 
lar masses on exposure. The more incoherent material has much the color and 
appearance of that composing the Turtle bed at Bear creek, but contains much 
less clay. It does not differ materially from its equivalent in the White river 
valley, of which Eagle Nest Butte forms a part. 
Leaving the Niobrara river for Fort Laramie, we pass over a large area 
covered with sand hills, which have a dull ferruginous tinge, and are evidently 
composed of the eroded materials from bed D. One of these hills measured 
one hundred and eighty feet in heighth, with very steep sides, its present con- 
formation being preserved by the roots of vast numbers of a species of Yucca, 
which cover the hill and seem to find their maximum growth in this sandy soil. 
Near Spoonbill creek bed E is composed mostly of a very coarse conglomerate, 
formed of angular and water-worn fragments similar to those seen in the 
granitic, metamorphic and carboniferous rocks, in the Black Hills, the 
fragments varying in size from one-eighth of an inch, to four inches in 
diameter and cemented with rather coarse silicious sand. It kere forms huge 
overhanging ledges, large masses of which have fallen to the base of the hills, 
and are scattered over the plains below, giving to the scenery a very rugged 
appearance. 
On Raw Hide Butte creek, bed D approximates more closely in its character 
to the turtle bed B of the vertical section. On an exposed area, not more 
than eight or ten yards square, in the valley of the creek, I observed fragments 
of at least eight turtles ( Testudo nehrascensis) with a few mammalian remains 
similar to those found so abundantly in bed at Ash Grrove Spring. The 
upper Miocene beds E and D occupy the country around Fort Laramie, ex- 
clusively, and extend to the base of the Laramie range of mountains. Bed Z> 
attains by far the greatest thickness, bed having been eroded away to a great 
extent, and losing its conglomerate character, while bed D becomes one hun- 
dred and eighty to two hundred feet in thickness. The incoherent materials are 
here much more calcareous and of a finer grit, while the concretionary layers 
are formed of a sandstone coarser grained than at localities heretofore men- 
tioned. 
From Fort Laramie to Laramie Hills, August lid. 
Our course was 10Â° south of west from Fort Laramie ; travelled over Tertiary 
beds E and D for twelve miles, until we came to the head of Warm Spring, 
where we observed a bed of carboniferous limestone seventy-five feet in thickness. 
The strata seem to dip gently each way from a central axis, and are exposed 
at this locality over an area of only five or six hundred square yards. The up- 
heaval is evidently a local one, the limestones being revealed by the erosion 
and removal of the Tertiary beds from the valley of the stream, which are every 
where undisturbed, resting unconformably upon the limestones on all sides. 
Nine miles farther on our route, another upheaval is exposed by the wearing 
away of the Tertiary beds in the valley of the Big Cotton Wood creek. Here we 
have eighty feet of carboniferous limestone, with a similar central axis of eleva- 
tion from which the strata dip in all directions, while the Tertiary beds again 
rest unconformably upon their inclined edges. As we approach the Laramie 
Hills, no carboniferous rocks were seen in place, but the whole country is 
covered with a heavy deposit of drift, consisting of gravel and water-worn 
boulders from all the formations in this region. 
Descending the Laramie Fork toward Fort Laramie, we again find the coun- 
try covered with a thick deposit of drift, composed of a great variety of more

or less water-worn materials derived from the mountains. The true Tertiary- 
beds are revealed, by erosion, occasionally near the bed of the river, but no 
indications of the upheaval of the carboniferous rocks. 
x\bout twelve miles above Fort Laramie, both on the Laramie river, and the 
Platte a remarkable deposit is seen, composed of a coarse conglomerate, fifty 
to one hundred and fifty feet in thickness, of a recent character, and evidently 
formed since the scooping out of the present river valleys. Indeed the form of 
the deposit is that of a basin twUve or fifteen miles in length, and reaching its 
greatest thickness only in the valleys of the rivers, while the more elevated 
portions of the country between the Forks consist of the true Tertiary beds. It 
seems to vary from an aggregation of particles of quartz to an exceed- 
ingly coarse conglomerate made up of every variety of material, much of which 
I have not yet seen in place. 
Fort Laramie to the Black Hills. 
Proceeding north from Fort Laramie, we pass over Tertiary beds for the first 
seven miles, and then come to an extension of the Laramie range of Hills, 
which exhibits many peculiarities. The whole range appears to be composed 
of a group of conical elevations, and ridges which seem to illustrate very clearly, 
the irregular efi"ect of the subterranean forces by which they were upheaved. 
A considerable thickness of carboniferous limestone was observed upon the 
sides and summits of these elevations, inclining at various angles, depending 
upon the power of the disturbing force from beneath, and when unchanged by- 
heat contain numerous fossils. We can here see every variety of carboniferous 
limestone, from the unchanged fossiliferous rock, to that of a completely meta- 
morphosed character, with the indications of stratification nearly or quite ob- 
literated. Sometimes the melted material is thrust up through fissures in the 
unchanged rock, so that in a single hand specimen we have the changed and 
unchanged rock. The metamorphosed carboniferous limestones are usually of 
a deep red color, very compact, sometimes assuming a vitreous aspect, ^ but 
never the thoroughly crystalline character of the older azoic rocks. Sometimes 
the limestones are elevated, so as to leave the strata horizontal, then again 
they are inclined at an angle of ten to thirty degrees. At tlie base of these 
ridges, the upper Miocene beds are seen insinuating themselves into ravines, 
or deposited high up on the sides of the elevations, thus filling up the irregulari- 
ties formed by the numerous local disturbances. 
In all cases the Tertiary beds are undisturbed, and not unfrequently rest 
directly upon the vertical edges of the azoic or granitic rocks. About eight 
miles west of Raw Hide Peak, the carboniferous limestones present a peculiar 
appearance, not unlike that of some Tertiary strata upon the Yellowstone, 
which have been fused or semi-fused by the burning out of the Lignite beds. 
The fused masses are very compact and heavy, varying in composition and 
color, red, yellow and mottled, oftentimes containing small fragments of par- 
tially changed rock, thus forming a sort of breccia. 
After crossing the Niobrara river, the upheavals nearly cease, the blue car- 
boniferous limestone only being exposed in a few places. The Tertiary beds 
occupy the larger portion of the country. Passing the dividing ridge, between 
the Niobrara and Shyenne rivers, into the Valley of Old Woman's creek, we 
find the Tertiary attaining its full development, and assuming a variety of fan- 
tastic forms from erosion, like the Bad Lands at Ash Grove Spring. The hills 
were covered with small pines. 
On the east side of Old Woman's creek is a high ridge, trending southwest 
and southeast, composed of variegated sandstone, varying from a fine compact 
silicious rock to a coarse reddish conglomerate or sandstone, with no fossils, 
except indistinct traces of vegetable remains. This ridge, which belongs to 
Cretaceous formation No. 1, is the result of a less violent upheaval, and is ex- 
posed by the erosion of the Tertiary beds from the valley. On the distant hills, 
on each side of the valley, the denuded Tertiary beds are visible, while near 
the bottom of the stream the Titanotherium bed was observed by Lieut. War- 
1858.]

ren, presenting its usual lithological characters, and containing bones and 
teeth of the animal from which it derives its name. The following section of 
strata, in descending order, will show the details of this upheaval.

f. â Compact ferruginous sandstone, ...... 80 feet. 
e. â Yellow friable sandstone, ....... 2 feet.

h. â Drab or ash colored indurated clay, passing down into red clay, 6 feet. 
a. â Variable incoherent clays, red, yellowish, &c., which may be of Jurassic 
age, 50 feet. 
Passing down the valley toward the Shyenne, the Tertiary beds disappear, 
and the Cretaceous bed No. 5 occupies the country. At one locality an up- 
heaval was observed, exposing all the subdivisions of the Cretaceous rocks, as 
will appear from the following section : 
No. 5. Presenting its usual lithological characters, with numerous fossils ; 
strata but slightly disturbed, 100 to 150 feet. 
No. 4. Presenting same characters as on the Missouri river, . 100 feet. 
No. 3 150 feet. 
No. 2 200 feet. 
No. 1 250 to 300 feet. 
No. 5 is but slightly disturbed, as will be seen by examining the illustrative 
section. Nos. 4, 3 and 2 present only the vertical edges of this strata, across 
which the above measurements were taken. The strata of No. 1 seem to have 
been elevated so as to retain a nearly horizontal position. No. 3 at this locality 
contains numerous fossils, the most abundant of which are Ostrea congesta ^nd 
Inoceramus prohleynaticus. This bed does not present altogether the same 
lithological character as on the Missouri river, but possesses a more laminated 
and gritty structure, sometimes approaching to a calcareous sandstone. Cross- 
ing the Shyenne, on our way northward, we have the commencement of a series 
of ridges of upheaval, which surround the Black Hills. 
I could not ascertain that there was any regularity in the dip and strike of 
the strata, each ridge or local upheaval ditFering from the other in that re- 
spect. As we approach the southern base of the Black Hills, the strata incline 
very nearly to the southeast. No. 1 does not appear, but we have a fine de- 
velopment of No. 2, possessing all its characteristics of plastic clay, with ash- 
colored grit concretions, containing an abundance of well preserved fossils ; 
No. 3, with large quantities of 0. congesta and /. problematicits, in an exceed- 
ingly comminuted condition ; No. 4 also appears, and No. 5 caps the hills on 
all sides. Nos. 2 and 3 are exposed only by the upheaval. On a branch of 
Beaver creek we find No. 2. one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet in thick- 
ness, and presenting its usual characters in full. 
Inasmuch as the principal facts relating to the Geology of the Black Hills 
have already been discussed, I will omit the details of our exploration of them, 
and pass on to a description of the country along our route, from Bear Peak, 
on the north eastern base of the Black Hills, to the entrance of the Niobrara 
river into the Missouri. 
Near Bear Peak, No. 2 is quite largely developed, presenting its usual litho- 
logical characters, and containing great quantities of fish remains, but no other 
fossils were seen in it. No. 1 is composed of variegated clays, grits and sand-, 
stones, with indistinct vegetable-impressions, fossil wood, and a few unchar- 
acteristic Saurian bones. No. 3 is also exposed by the upheaval of the beds, 
with its usual fossils, but possessing the character of a laminated calcare- 
ous sandstone, instead of the soft homogeneous calcareous marl of the Mis- 
souri river. From thence to the Shyenne, No. 4 forms a surface of the coun- 
try, for the most part undisturbed. 
I will not here dwell upon the influences which the eroding power of water 
must have exerted, in modifying the physical features of the country in and

around the Black Hills. I am inclined to the opinion, however, that prior to 
the convulsion that upheaved the fossiliferous rocks, only the Cretaceous "beds 
Nos. 4 and 5 were exposed in any portion of this region. 
Along the Shyenne River, No. 4 contains most finely preserved fossils in the 
greatest abundance. Large Ammonites, two to three feet in diameter, still 
preserving their original pearly lustre, Scaphites, Baculites, Ostrea, &c. Ascend- 
ing the valley of Sage Creek, we pass over the Cretaceous beds for the first five 
miles, which contain an abundance of fossils similar to those found on the 
Shyenne. We then meet with the lowest bed of the great Tertiary Basin of 
White River, resting conformably upon Cretaceous strata, which appear to be 
a blending of Nos. 4 and 5. We have, first, the dark clays of No. 4, then the 
yellowish brown, gritty shale of No. 5, with numerous ferruginous concretions ; 
then the Titanotherium bed which sets regularly upon No. 5, and exhibits its 
highest development in the valleys of Sage and Bear Creeks. It is here com- 
posed, 1st, of a band of argillaceous grit weathering to a pink color, two feet in 
thickness, passing up into an ash colored plastic clay with a greenish tinge, 
full of chalcedony and calcareous concretions, altogether 50 to 80 feet in thick- 
ness ; then a light gray calcareous grit upon which rests the Turtle Bed. A 
considerable deposit of drift consisting of water-worn bowlders, and loose sand 
and gravel, is distributed over the surface of the Bad Lands to a greater or less 
extent. 
Proceeding up the valley of the Shyenne, we see only the Cretaceous beds 
Nos. 4 and 5, until we pass the mouth of Bear Creek, when the Tertiary makes 
its appearance, crossing the Shyenne and stretching off toward the base of 
the Black Hills in long ridges or isolated Buttes. The belt of Tertiary on the 
left side of the Shyenne is about thirty miles in width. A section fifteen miles 
above the mouth of Bear Creek, on the Shyenne, presents the following char- 
acters. 
c. â Light gray indurated clay, 6 feet. 
b. â Seam of gray sandstone, 18 inches. 
Â«â¢ â Ash-colored plastic clay with a greenish tinge, and a pinkish band of fine 
grit at the base, ; 30 feet. 
The Titanotherium Bed varies much in its lithological characters in different 
localities. The layer of gray sandstone is sometimes two to four feet in thick- 
ness, composed of an aggregate of water-worn pebbles, with granular quartz, 
and small particles of mica, forming somewhat conspicuous ledges. On the 
western side of the Shyenne, the Titanotherium bed presents the following 
characters proceeding upward from No. 5 : First, alternate seams of small peb- 
bles and loose sand, two to six inches in thickness, passing up into a fine 
ferruginous grit, containing small scales of mica, weathering to a light gray 
color, then a band of pinkish gritty clay, six inches in thickness, passing up 
into ash-colored clay which has also alternate gritty layers. The pink band if 
quite persistent, and being exposed whenever the Titanotherium Bed is worn 
through, marks with a good degree of precision the base of the Tertiary. The 
surface in many places is covered with water-worn pebbles, varying in size from 
an eighth of an inch to eighteen inches in diameter, though mostly small, and 
representing all the varieties of metamorphosed rocks, with rounded masses of 
lime and flint rock, fossil wood, &c., so that No. 5, when the Titanotherium Bed 
is eroded away, is paved with this loose material. The Turtle Bed alone does not 
sÂ«em to be so marked in its character here as at Bear Creek. It weathers to a light 
yellow color and passes almost insensibly into the bed above. I have marked 
the line of separation at this locality, between the Turtle bed and the one over- 
lying it, by a layer of very porous argillaceous sandstone of a dull brown or 
drab color. The Turtle bed contains much more sand than at Bear Creek, and 
the upper portion consists of alternate layers of calcareous concretions and 
indurated argillaceous grit with one band, eight feet in thickness, of ash-colored 
clay. Disseminated through the bed in every direction, are thin seams of chal-

cedony, A few mammalian remains were found, mostly of Oreodon and Rhino- 
'-eros. 
On the right or east side of the Shyenne, as we pass over to White River, the 
Cretaceous bed No. 5 presents some peculiarities which may be worthy of no- 
tice, inasmuch as the upper portion seems to form a transition or bed of passage 
into the Tertiary. We have, first, No. 4, black laminated clay gradually pass- 
ing up into dark brown clay, then becoming deep ferruginous ; again a dull 
purplish hue, with seams half an inch to an inch in thickness of ferruginous 
matter passing up into a deep yellow arenaceous clay ; lastly, a brown clay un- 
derlying the Titanotheriura bed. I have been thus minute in describing these 
beds, from the fact that the transition from the Cretaceou? to the Tertiary period 
seems as gradual and as natural as that of any of the subdivisions of the Creta- 
oeous system into each other ; and were it not for the organic remains which 
characterize each, we would scarcely be aware that we were passing from one 
great geological period to another. 
At another locality the Titanotherium bed at the base consists of clay with 
a purplish tinge, filled with angular grains of quartz and water-worn pebbles, 
two feet ; then a loose incoherent gravel, with pebbles, four inches ; then six 
to eight feet of light gray clay, filled with pebbles and angular grains of quartz, 
sometimes forming a sort of quartzose sandstone, passing up into a dark ash- 
â 'olored clay, with a greenish tinge. 
A section of the different beds, is shown on White River, would be as 
follows : 
f Flesh colored marl, ...... 10 feet.

Cretaceous Beds J^os. 5 and 4. 
In the valley of White River the Cretaceous beds Nos. 5 and 4 are exposed 
by the erosion of the overlying Tertiary beds, as may be seen by reference to 
the accompanying map. No. 5 reveals numerous fossils in similar tough argil- 
laceous concretions, as those observed on the west side of the Shyenne. All 
the calcareous matter has been dissolved away from the shells, leaving only 
casts. The upper portion presents a variety of lithological characters, and is 
destitute of fossils. 
Leaving the valley of V/hite River, we proceeded nearly a south-east course, 
ascending gradually to the dividing ridge between White and Niobrara Rivers, 
where we find the largest development of bed Z>, which exhibits its usual litho- 
logical characters, but contains very few fossils. Passing the head of wounded- 
knee creek, we begin to see indications of the Pliocene formation, with a few 
mammalian remains, and on reaching the Niobrara, the upper Miocene bed^ 
are covered with a thick deposit of Pliocene strata. This more recent forma- 
tion presents at this locality the same lithological characters as those given in 
the vertical section, and extends nearly to the mouth of Turtle Hill creek, where 
Cretaceous beds Nos. 4 and 3 gradually rise to the surface and cover the coun- 
try. Outliers of Pliocene are visible, however, on both sides of the Missouri 
River in many localities, the principal of which are Medicine and Bijoux Hills, 
the latter of which has yielded several very interesting species of Mammalia 
[June^

Upper Miocene bed D is not unfrequently revealed in the channel of the Nio- 
brara, presenting a very irregular outline, showing most conclusively the great 
erosion that must have taken place prior to the deposition of the Pliocene beds. 
It would seem that after the deposition of the materials that entombed the Mio- 
cene fauna, this whole region was eroded so as to present the same rugged 
features as the Bad Lands of White River, and that the Pliocene beds were de- 
posited upon this irregular surface entombing a second fauna, specifically dis- 
tinct from, yet intermediate between that of the Miocene and our present period. 
I have attempted, in the illustrative section* along the Niobrara, to show the ir- 
regular outline of the bed Z>, prior to the deposition of the recent beds. The 
greatest thickness of Pliocene is always found in the valleys of the streams, and 
in consequence of its loose incoherent character is much denuded, forming thf 
principal part of the material of the sand hills.

of the species exhibited a remarkable resemblance to some found in the United 
States. Yet this resemblance was not between species of groups peculiar to 
the eastern sides of both continents, if any such exist, nor between those found 
on either margin of the Pacific Ocean, but was found in species belonging to 
cosmopolitan genera, and the parallelism was between those of Japan and those 
of the Atlantic States. He had previously shown, in comparing the Coleoptera 
of Western America with those of Europe, that where parallelism existed it was 
also in genera of similarly wide distribution. 
He also called attention to a very remarkable species of Carabus in the same 
collection, which imitates, by its slender form and long narrow thorax, the genus 
Damaster from the same region, and seems to connect the latter with the ordinary 
Carabus, just as Damaster connects Carabus with Cychrus. While possessing 
this remarkable form of body, however, the elytra are destitute of the apical 
prolongation seen in Damaster, and the sculpture is that of certain Carabi, con- 
sisting of approximate punctures, with three faint ranges of chain-like elevations. 
On leave granted, the Committee appointed to confer with Dr. Hayes 
in regard to his proposed Arctic Exploration, presented a Report as 
follows : 
That the exploration contemplated by Dr. Hayes appears to deserve the en- 
couragement of all individuals or societies who possess an interest in the 
advancement of science, and especially of those who cultivate the various 
branches of Natural History, for the following reasons : 
1st. The interesting problem of the existence of an open Polar Sea cannot 
as yet be considered as satisfactorily solved ; as is made manifest by the 
doubts recently expressed by a distinguished geographer, in a memoir read 
before the Royal Geographical Society of London. Yet this problem is so 
intimately connected with theories of climate, not only in that region, but 
over a very large partion of the Northern Hemisphere, that its definite 
solution must be considered as of the utmost importance to the study of 
geography ; and it is not impossible that its investigation may lead to valuable 
results of a more commercial nature. It seems probable, therefore, that this 
subject will attract the attention of other nations, who are engaged in an 
honorable rivalry with us in promoting the knowledge of the surface of the 
earth, and it is highly desirable that the credit of furnishing the definite 
solution should belong to the nation to whose energy and enterprise the 
interesting results already obtained are due. 
2d. The natural history of this extensive region remains, as yet, almost 
entirely unknown ; while, from the peculiarities of its climate, and its 
proximity to the land of the Eastern Hemisphere, it seems certain that much 
valuable information as to the habits of animals and plants, and the connec- 
tion of our Faunas and Floras, both ancient and modern, with those of Europe 
and Asia, may be gained by such an exploration as is here contemplated. 
3d. The excessive difficulties and hardships of such an exploration, serve 
to deter any but the most adventurous spirits from undertaking it ; while the 
peculiar circumstances under which both the instruments of observation and 
the observers themselves are placed, render a frequent repetition of the 
observations necessary to produce confidence in the results. Every encourage- 
ment should therefore be extended to all who are willing to undertake the 
arduous task, and capable of properly meeting its unusual responsibilities. 
The Committee therefore recommend to the Academy the adoption of the 
following resolutions : 
Resolved, That the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, having full 
confidence in the energy, ^prudence and scientific capacity of Dr. Hayes, 
recommends the Arctic expedition projected by him to the favorable considera- 
tion of all who are in a position to assist him in his enterprise, believing 
that its success will contribute largely to the advancement of science and to 
the honor of our country.

PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 
spriag of 1857, I examined damp forests in the neighborhood of Wilmington, 
J^orth Carolina, and Charleston, South Carolina, without detecting it. In Au- 
gust, of 1857, while seeking salamanders and helices, in company with Dr. "Wil- 
son and Mr. Conrad, on the summit of Broad Top Mountain, of the Alleghany 
range, in western Pennsylvania, I found one specimen. Last mouth, while on 
a visit to our fellow member, Mr, S. Powel, at Newport, R. I., one damp morn- 
ing I observed two fine specimens of the planaria, creeping near the top of a 
fence 8 feet in height. On the night of the same day, at the proposal of Mr. 
Powel, by the light of a lantern, we sought for the animal about the fence sur- 
rounding his grounds, and in the course of an hour we found twelve fine speci- 
mens. They were obtained from all parts of the fence, some on the top, and 
others on the ground. 
Eight of them I have preserved alive, and now have them at my residence, 
living in a glass box beneath some fragments of moist wood. Occasionally I 
feed them on a crushed house-fly, which they appear to enjoy, as they suck at 
it with their protruded oesophagus for an hour at a time. 
They are from 5 to 7 lines long, and creep about like the slug, with their snout- 
like head erect. They are light-ash colored, with a blackish streak down each 
side of the back, and a blackish spot just back of the middle, corresponding in 
position below with the mouth. In form they are like an awl split in its length, 
the narrower end forming the head. At the base of the latter is a pair of pro- 
minent black eyes. The lateral borders of the head are often inflected, and the 
head itself is sometimes, in a state of rest, doubled upon the back. The intestine 
presents the same dendritic arrangement as in the true fluviatile planariae. 
Dr. Meigs made some remarks touching the importance of obtaining statistics 
regarding the actual condition of Craniological collections, with a view to esta- 
blish a system of exchanges.

Mineralogical Notes. 
BY W. J. TAYLOR. 
Lecontite. 
This new and interesting mineral is remarkable as being a double sulphate 
of ammonia and soda with potash, containing two equivalents of water, and 
yet homceomorphous with the group of the anhydrous sulphates, and with 
Mascagnine, which contains but one equivalent of water. According 
to Prof. Dana (System. Mineralogy, p. 379), the formula for Mascagnine is 
RO, SO3 2 HO, but this is a typographical error ; the proper formula for this 
mineral being RO, SO3 + HO, as will be seen in Sixth Supplement to Mineralo- 
gy by Prof. Dana. Lecontite and Mascagnine are consequently homceomor- 
phous, its difference in angle being about four degrees, (Lecontite, /: /= 103Â° 
12^, 0:11+ 117Â° 7/ ; Mascagnine, /: J=107Â° 40^ 0 : H 122Â° 56^,) and yet 
the one contains two equivalents of water and the other but one. Prof. 
Dana has very kindly made the annexed measurements of two crystals, which I 
sent to him soon after receiving the mineral from Dr. Le Conte, which measure- 
ments I made the substance of a verbal communication to the Academy, on the 
evening of the 16th of February, but owing to a mistake, it did not appear in 
print (though it is recorded in the minutes of that meeting) before the 
May number of the Academy's Proceedings. It was at this time supposed to be 
a new mineral, from the difl'erence in angle found by Prof. Dana between it and 
other homoeomorphous sulphates ; and by a qualitative analysis that I made^

178 
it was considered to be a double sulphate of potash and ammonia, (the 
potash, I then thought, was in excess,) and anhydrous, (in this judging er- 
roneously from the form). 
The composition is now definitely determined by a thorough quantitative ex- 
amination, which, by the courtesy of Dr. F. A. Genth, I have made in his labo- 
ratory, and whom I here thank, for the facilities afforded me in the investi- 
gation of this new mineral. 
Lecontite occurs in crystals varying greatly in size, some being an inch in 
length and narrow prisms ; others are short, not exceeding one-eighth of an inch 
in length and quite broad. The smaller crystals are more perfect in form than 
the larger ones, and the angles are better defined. 
The following are the measurements of Prof. Dana ; the crystals he mentions 
did not admit of measurement by a reflected image, so that it was necessary to 
use a candle : 
Trimetric or right rhombic prism â

I4 hardnesss the crystals of Lecontite are from 2- to 2-5 ; when free from 
the exterior organic matter they are clear and colorless ; the smaller crystals 
are coated with a thin crust of organic matter from the matrix. 
Taste saline and rather bitter. Permanent in the air; they contain as follows ; 
Ammonia, per ct. 12-94 contains oxygen 3-981 
Potash, " 2-67 " " 0-45 }-8-93.

Water, " 19-45 " " 17-28

Phosphoric acid, " a trace 
There is consequently an oxygen ratio of ammonia, soda and sulphuric acid and 
water, according to the numbers 8-93 : 26-94: 17-28, which is almost exactly 
as 1:3:2, from which we have the general formula RO SO3 -j- 2H0, and 
from this the specific formula (as Prof. Dana would write it) 2NH4 0, SO3 -f-o 
(NaO, KO) SO3 + 10 HO 5 or ( ] NH4 0 1 NaO, KO) SO3 + 2H0). 
[It may be interesting to mention that there is an artificial salt, with a for- 
mula exactly corresponding to this, and of the same form, which, though rare, 
has been described by several chemists; it contains no potash, being solely Â». 
double sulphate of ammonia and soda, with the two equivalents of water, as 
mentioned above. It is described in Gmelin, Vol. Ilf., p. 119, (Cavd. Edit ) : 
Seguin, Ann. Chem., 91, 219 ; Riffault, Ann. de Chem. et Phys., 20, 432 and 435 
describe the salt and its formation, and Berzelius (3, 286) mentions that the 
crystals are derived from right rhombic prisms. In Rammelsberg's Krystallo- 
graphische Chemie, p. 234, there is a figure and measurements of a trimetri<- 
(or right rhombic) crystal of a double sulphate of ammonia and soda, with four 
equivalents of water,* (NH4 0, SO3 + NaO, SO3) -f 4H0 ; it is from a descrip-

tioa and measurements by Mitscherlich : Pogg. Ann., 58, 469, but at present 
not having the works to compare, I am unable to conclude whether or not it is 
another salt, homoeomorphous with the one just described. The similarity of 
form between compounds, in which there is a difference in the equivalents of 
water, is an interesting subject for investigation, and I shall endeavor to show 
at a future time, that the Trimetric sulphate of ammonia, generally considered 
anhydrous, may contain one or two equivalents of water, and yet preserve its 
homoeomorphism.] 
Lecontite was brought to this country, in January last, by Dr. John L. 
Le Conte, on his return from Honduras. He discovered it in the cave near Las 
Piedras, in the vicinity of Comayagua. It occurs in crystals imbedded in a 
black matrix, resembling bitumen in appearance, which Dr. Le Conte considers 
to be the decomposed excrement of bats, which infest this cave in great num- 
bers, and have, most likely, inhabited it for ages. The cave near the entrance 
was, at the time of his visit, being worked for nitre, which was obtained 
'â¢^ directly by lixiviating the earth taken from near the mouth of the cave. 
" The material containing the crystals merely furnished a tarry, black, semi- 
fluid mass, without nitre." On some of the crystals were observed minute 
hairs of the bats adhering, and I observed mor^, when removing the crystals 
from their matrix. In honor of Dr. Le Conte, for this interesting species 
which he has been the means of adding to mineralogy, I propose to call the 
mineral Lecontite. 
Sulphate of Ammonia and Soda. 
In looking over specimens of minerals recently presented to the Acade- 
my, my attention was attracted by a substance labelled " Ammonia," from 
the Chincha Islands of the Pacific Ocean; from its appearance it was suspected 
to be a sulphate of ammonia, and a qualitative examination confirmed my 
suspicion. It is in compact lumps, about the size of hickory nuts ; hardness 
from 2.5 to 3 : its color is a yellowish white, with a crystalline structure, 
taste pungent and bitter : opaque and permanent in the air. By a qualitative 
analysis, I found it to contain sulphuric acid, ammonia, soda and some or- 
ganic matter, and by my first trials iu a matrass I could not find water ; on repeat- 
ing them, I have found a small quantity. Whether the water is really a part of 
the mineral a quantitative analysis only can determine. I made an approxima- 
tive determination of the sulphuric acid from a small fragment, and found it 
to contain about 48 per cent. Heated on platinum foil it blackens and fuses, 
though not very readily, leaving a white bead, which is soluble in water, and 
tastes a little saline and bitter. This mineral was presented to the Academy, 
I believe, by Dr. Bridges. 
Siercoriie ? 
I am indebted to Dr. Bridges for a specimen of a mineral from the Chincha 
Guano Islands, accompanying the sulphate above described, which, from a 
qualitative analysis, I now suppose to be Stercorite, (microcosmic salt,) which 
has been discovered by T. J. Herapath, Esq., in the guano from the Island of 
Ichaboe, on the western coast of Africa ; it never has to my knowledge been 
found in the Pacific guano. I hope to get sufficient material to settle definitely 
whether it belongs to this species. The mineral which I have is columnar in 
structure, and has evidently been taken from a crevice in the guano. It is 
opaque ; yellowish white in color, very soft, taste somewhat sharp, saline and 
slightly ammoniacal, partially deliquescent in the air. 
B. B. or gently heated on platinum foil over a spirit lamp it intumesces and 
blackens, giving off ammonia and water ; afterwards it fuses to a clear bead, 
which is readily soluble in water and has a saline taste. By a qualitative ex- 
amination I found ammonia, soda, and an excess of phosphoric acid. 
The physical characters are quite different from those of the stercorite de- 
scribed by Mr. Herapath, but the chemical components and the reactions before 
the blow pipe are similar.

Stauroiide? 
A mineral resembling the so called Staurotide (?) found at the Canton Mine, 
Georgia, described by Prof. Shepard, (3d Supplement Dana's Mineralogy, p. 16,) 
I have found some time since, at a copper mine near Webster, Jackson Co., N. C. 
associated with automolite crystals as at the former locality. The prelimi- 
nary analyses made of the mineral from the Canton Mine by Dr. Genth and my- 
self, (the results of which agree,) renders the conclusion as to its being Stau- 
rotide very doubtful. 
Cuproplumhite ? 
Among the ores brought home by Dr. Le Conte from his recent explorations 
in Honduras, was a specimen which particularly attracted my attention, from 
the mine of Antonio Cruz, near Comayagua ; apparently it is galena, being 
massive and granular, with a cubical cleavage, on the faces of which there is a 
bronze tarnish, which gives the effect of a play of colors not unlike that on 
Bastite (Schiller Spar), the color being more coppery. On the edges it is de- 
composed, forming massive carbonate of lead, whilst the copper (in little geodes), 
as crystallized malachite, is disseminated through the mass. 
B. B. lead, copper and a trace of antimony, streak black ; sectile and brit-

Notwithstanding the similarity between its reactions and that of the cupro-

in Tuscany, but the peculiar bronze hue of the cubical faces indijiccd mp-tg 
mention it among these notes. As soon as time permits I will analyse it quan- 
titatively.

found near Webster, Jackson Co., N. C. in a band of serpentine, associated with 
chrome iron ; (this band of serpentine is about two or three hundred yards in 
width, bearing N. E. and dips S.) It occurs as an amorphous reniform incrus- 
tation on a brownish green, granular serpentine, in which are crystals of chrome 
iron. Its hardness is about 3; lustro resirous ; its color varies from an apple 
green to a yellowish green, streak greenish white. In a matrass, yields water.

Dr. C. M. Cresson called attention to the specimens of ripple-marked 
sandstone presented by him this evening. They were taken from Second 
Mountain in the gap, through which the west branch of the Schuylkill passed, 
Schuylkill Co., Pa. The formation is No. 10 of Rogers' enumeration, other- 
wise known as the Vespertine White Sandstone. These ripple-marked plates 
occur in thin laminae, and those at present exposed consist of three layers : 
two outer layers ripple-marked upon the surfaces next to the centre plate, and 
plane upon the exterior surfaces, and a centre plate ripple-marked upon each 
side, the markings fitting those of the enclosing laminae. These waves are 
extremely regular and very nearly parallel with each other. The apices or 
crests of the waves are about 3'' apart, and the depression varies from |" to f 
The thickness of the plates averages about 1|- inches.

Description of a New TANAGER from the Isthmus of Darien, and note on 
SELENIDERA SPECTABILIS, Cassin. 
BY JOHN CASSIN. 
Having recently had an opportunity of examining a collection of birds made 
on the Isthmus of Darien, I have been much gratified as well as surprised to 
find both sexes of the Toucan, recently described by me, under the name of 
Selenidera spectabilis, (Proc. Acad., 1857, p. 214.) The collection alluded to 
was made by a party under the command of Lieut. N. Michler, U. S. Topog. 
Eng., that surveyed a route for a ship canal across the Isthmus, by order of the 
Government of the United States. 
In the collection, there is also a single specimen of a Tanager of the same 
group as Calliste gyrola, gyroloides and Desmarestii, but distinct from either,

and easily recognised by nearly the whole of the outer surface of the wing be- 
ing bright chestnut like the head. It is as follows : â 
1. Calliste Lavinia, Cassin. 
Very similar to C. gyrola, gyroloides and Desmarestii, and about the same 
size, but having the shoulders, wing coverts, and outer edges of the secondary 
and shorter primary quills, bright rufous chestnut, with a golden yellow lustre 
on the shoulder. Head above and cheeks bright chestnut, back of the neck 
golden yellow, which color extends somewhat and fades gradually on the back. 
Throat with a longitudinal stripe of pale blue, and another of the same color 
on the middle of the abdomen ; tibiae rufous. All other parts fine lustrous 
green, inner webs of quills and tail feathers black, bill and feet light colored. 
Total length about 4^ inches, wing 2^, tail If inches. 
Hab. Isthmus of Darien, New Grenada. Discovered by Mr. W. S. Wood, 
Jr., naturalist, attached to U. S. Surveying party, in command of Lieut. N. 
Michler, U. S. Topog. Engineers. 
This handsome bird is named in honor of Mrs. Lavinia Bowen, of this city, 
whose superior skill as an artist in natural history, and especially in ornithol- 
ogy, fully entitles her to such commemoration. Nearly all plates in Ornithology 
published in this city within the last twenty years, and many others in every 
department of Zoology, have been prepared under the supervision and direc- 
tion of this lady. 
2. Selenidera spectabilis, Cassin. 
Selenidera spectabilis, Cassin. Proc. Acad. Philada., 1857, p. 214. 
As stated above, both sexes of this bird are in the collection made by the 
surveying party, on the Isthmus of Darien, in command of Lieut. Michler, 
U. S. Top. Eng. The males do not vary from my description, as cited above, 
and both sexes have the bill parti-colored and variegated in its lighter portion 
as previously described. 
Female. General colors very similar to those of the male, but with the 
head above dark chestnut, as in the females of other species of the genus Se- 
lenidera. Under tail coverts scarlet, mixed with dark chestnut. 
According to Mr. William S. Wood, Jr., who accompanied the expedition as 
naturalist, this Toucan was obtained near the village of Susio, in the province 
of Choco, New Grenada. It was observed, generally, frequenting a tree called 
Cremantina, by the inhabitants, on the fruit of which it appeared to subsist at 
the period when noticed.

Mr. Lea exhibited two specimens of Triqueira coniorta, Lea, (ffyria, Lam.) 
^ which he had received from Mr. Cuming, of London. They were from 
Shanghai, and make four specimens known of this curious and rare species of 
the family Unionidce. Mr. Lea called attention to the fact, that these two 
specimens had both the same curve on the dorsal and basal margins, that the 
two previously exhibited by him and described in the Journal had, thus finally 
proving that the twisted form of this Triqueira is its normal character, like 
Area tortuosa^ Lin. in the Arcades. One of these specimens will be found in the

margin, four large oblong spots of black proceeding from tbe exterior margin, 
the two intermediate ones reaching beyond the middle of the wing, the others 
shorter, with each a small fulvous spot near the tip ; and four spots of black 
descending from the sub-costal nervure, of which the one nearest the body is 
linear, the next square, the third roundish with a fulvous spot in the centre, 
and the fourth connate with the fourth of the before mentioned spots proceed- 
ing from the exterior margin. 
The lower wings are above bluish black, changing to brownish fulvous near 
the base, with an indistinct whitish spot below the centre. 
The under side of the upper wings has seven spots of pearly white parallel 
with the outer margin, of which the five exterior ones are linear, and the two 
others round ; from these two round spots proceed two oblong black spots to 
the middle of the wing, and the two next have each a round black spot above 
them. From the sub-costal nervure proceed four black spots, of which the two 
nearest the body are linear, the next triangular, enclosing a fulvous spot, and 
the fourth is almost confounded with the black upper margin. 
The under side of the lower wings is brown, with four white sublunate spots, 
bounded above and below by black, and parallel with the lower margin ; there 
are likewise two long black spots outside of the outer one of these spots : the 
whole base of the wing is occupied by six large pearly spots radiating from the 
axilla, one of which occupies the pre-costal portion ; between the second and 
third (which are very wide) is a smaller spot, and the third is crossed near its 
base by a short black bar. The emarginations of the wings are margined with 
white. Body black, thorax thickly covered with brownish fulvous hairs. 
The above described Lepidopteron so nearly resembles the Argynnis Idalia, 
that at first sight it may easily be taken for a mere variety. The want of the 
double row of white spots on the upper surface of the lower wings, although a 
remarkable difierence, would not perhaps constitute a specific mark, yet when 
we come to examine the under surface, instead of the twenty-four or twenty- 
five spots of white, which are observed over its whole surface, we find but 
two near the margin and six large ones occupying nearly the whole of the 
base, and radiating from the axilla, we cannot hesitate to pronounce it distinct 
and certainly new. The larva is unknown. The interesting fact of so large a 
species of butterfly being found at this time in New Jersey, and having hereto- 
fore escaped the researches of all entomologists, has led me to offer this short 
communication for publication in the Proceedings. It was found by me in 
July of this summer, on Succasunna Plains, near Schooley's Mountain, in 
Morris Co. 
Note on the species of ELEODES found within the United States. 
BY JOHN L. LE CONTE, M. D. 
Having a number of nondescript species of Eleodes, which it becomes neces- 
sary to mention in a Catalogue of the Coleoptera of the TJ. S. and Mexican 
Boundary, now preparing for the press, I have considered it proper here to 
present descriptions of these species ; and for the purpose of elucidating their 
characters in the absence of a monographic essay, the following grouping of 
the species in my collection belonging to this very difiicult genus may be found 
useful. They are now very numerous, and quite heterogeneous in form, though 
tbe antennae and oral organs do not seem to have much variation. 
A. Elytra subconvex or depressed, oblong oval, margined or not, more or 
less sulcate (but in E. dispersa almost irregularly punctured and not striate) ; 
humeral angles distinctly margined. Presternum never mucronate ; anterior 
tarsi with the first joint inflated beneath and densely clothed with short bristles. 
Anterior femora toothed ; anterior tibiae of the females with the outer spur 
usually larger and broader than that of the males.

Creek Boundary, Dr. "Woodhouse. Of the same form as E. obscura, but 
with the thorax larger and less convex, the elytra a little more elongated and 
not at all striate ; the punctures are slightly muricated, even on the middle of 
the back ; at the sides and tip they become confluent transversely and more 
elevated, with a very short black bristle at the apex of each ; the sides of the 
elytra are not at all margined. The under surface and legs as in E. obscura, 
except that the tooth of the anterior femora is a little less obtuse 
The species of this group are related by the closest resemblances of form and 
sculpture, so much so that they may in some cases be considered as races, or 
geographical varieties. The one above described is remarkably distinct from 
the others, and must in all events rank as separate. Not so perhaps with a 
singular female specimen collected by Capt. Pope in New Mexico, which with 
the form of E. sulcipennis, exhibits an entire want of eljtral grooves, except at 
the sides behind the middle, where some faint traces are seen : the punctures 
are submuricate, and arranged in stria distinct on the back, confused at the 
sides ; between the rows are distant punctures as in E. obscura ; the tips are 
abruptly declivous, and furnished with rows of tubercles, alternately large and 
small, the latter corresponding to the striae of the anterior portion. The speci- 
men is 1-20 long, and the teeth of the anterior femora are very obtuse. For 
convenience this may be called E. del eta. 
Other specimens, both male and female, found in Arizona have also the 
form of E. sulcipennis, but the thorax is more convex, less flattened and less 
punctured at the sides, and more finely margined ; the grooves of the elytra 
are deeper, the interstices more smooth and shining, with much fewer scattered 
punctures ; sexual characters precisely as in E. sulcipennis. Length 1-14-1-30.

Texas : Messrs. Haldeman and Berlandiere. Of nearly the same form as E. 
tricostata, but entirely glabrous above, though pubescent beneath: the 
elytra of the female are wider than the thorax, sometimes flattened, sometimes 
uniformly, though slightly convex ; those of the male are narrower and flattened. 
The femora in both sexes are simple ; the spurs of the anterior tibiae of the 
female are unequal, the posterior one (the inner) is acute, the outer one is 
twice as long, wider and slightly obtuse. In the male the spurs are broken, 
but they appear to have been less unequal in size. The prosternum is not at

by Dr. Webb. The anterior femora are not at all armed or sinuate ; the pros- 
ternum is mucronate behind as in the preceding, and the mesosternum is con- 
cave. The abdomen is shining, sparsely rugous, with a few small punctures. 
This species is of the size and shape of E, e x t r i c a t a, but the elytra in that 
are densely almost irregularly punctured. E. cognata Hald. has the elytra 
finely not densely, but almost irregularly punctured, and in both the prosternuni 
is less produced, and rather carinate than mucronate.

and less conspicuously margined, and the sides are more rough, with small 
reclinate tubercles. This species agrees with the description ofE. parvicollis 
given by Mannerheim, (Bull. Mosc. 1843, 271) except that the base of the 
thorax is not narrower than the apex. Eschscholtz does not in his decription 
mention that the sides of the thorax are scabrous, but adds that the base of 
the thorax is nearly as wide as the widest portion of the thorax, whereby the 
latter appears small. A specimen from the St. Petersburg museum sent me 
as a type is not allied at all to this species, but rather toE. cordata. 
The smaller species of Eleodes of this division are exceedingly abundant, 
and seem subject to some variation. It will be impossible to attain any defi- 
nite results in the nomenclature of them until an authentic series of named 
specimens can be obtained by careful comparison with the types of Eschscholtz 
and Mannerheim.

Dr. Leidy remarked, that while spending a few weeks during the past sum-

S. Powel, at Newport, Rhode Island, they together had examined the neighbor-

ing fresh-water streams and ponds for Polyzoa. They had the good fortune to 
find a species of Cristatella ; being the first discovery of this genus in America. 
The locality of the polyzoon is Lily Pond, near Newport, in which it is found 
very abundantly^ adhering to the under side of stones forming the shores of 
the pond. 
In the month of August, the Cristatella masses were flattened, elliptical, 
about half an inch in length and about two lines wide, and were translu- 
cent yellowish white. About three rows of polyps encircled the masses. 
Each polyp supported on its horse- shoe-like arms seventy-two tentacles, con- 
joined at base by a delicate, festooned, areolated membrane. 
Specimens of the Cristatella, placed in a dish of water, moved at the rate of 
an inch in about twenty-four hours. 
The ova, or statoblasts, were only partially developed during ray stay at New- 
port. The present month, Mr. Powel has sent to me fully developed speci- 
mens, accompanied with a note, in which he says, " I made an expedition to 
the Lil}^ Pond, and procured great numbers of Cristatella with ova. I got upon 
one stone fifty-four separate masses, some of them one inch and three-quarters 
long and one quarter wide, of a beautiful amber color, full of ova, apparently in 
various stages of development." 
These ova are the largest that I have seen in any genus of Polyzoa. They 
are double convex lenticular, and circular, with a marginal discoidal aunulus, 
a little deeper on one side than on the other. From the inner margin of the 
annulus spring forth about seventy anchor-like appendages, of which fifty 
spring from one side, and bend in a doubly geniculate manner over the outer 
margin of the annulus ; the remaining twenty are shorter, and diverge from the 
opposite side. 
Breadth of statoblast, 1.152 mm., or about half a line independent of the 
anchors. 
This American species of Cristatella is respectfully dedicated to the sister of 
Mr. Powel, with the name of Cristatella Id^. 
From the European Cristatella mucedo^ the American species differs in habit 
as well as in several points of structure. Prof. Allman, in his valuable mono- 
graph on the Polyzoa, says, that " while the greater number of the fresh-water 
Polyzoa lurk on the under surface- of stones and in dark recesses, Cristatella 
loves to expose itself to the full light and warmth of the sun." 
The polyp of C. mucedo has about eighty tentacula; and the intestine is light 
bluish green. That of C. Idee has about seventy-two tentacula, and the intestine 
is yellowish. The ova or statoblasts of C. mucedo are about one thirty-third of 
an inch broad ; those of C. Ida are about half a line. Prof. Allman's figure 
of the statoblast of the former species represents the anchors as sigmoid; those 
of the latter species have a double elbow. 
The discovery of an American Cristatella has afforded me the opportunity of 
comparing its statoblasts with those of Pectinatella. The diagnosis formerly 
given by authors to those of Cristitella^ equally well apply to those of Pectina- 
tella^ while the statoblasts of the two genera differ in a remarkable manner. 
This is sufficiently well indicated by comparing the following description with 
that above given, of the statoblasts of Cristatella Mac. The statoblast of Pecti- 
natella magnifica is doubly convex lenticular, quadrately circular, and slightly 
curved, with a marginal discoidal annulus, much deeper on one side than on 
the other. From the outer margin of the annulus spring forth about twelve to 
sixteen straightly diverging anchors. Breadth of statoblast 0.88 mm. by 0.8 mm., 
or about the third of a line. 
Recently, Dr. Wm. Spiilman, of Columbus, Mississippi, has sent to me a de- 
scription, accompanied with drawings, of certain gelatinoid masses from the 
lakes of his vicinity, on which he desired some information. The masses, which 
Dr. Spiilman observes hang from the immersed branches of plants and dead 
sticks, at the present time, (October,) " are from the size of a hen's egg to such 
as measure 15 inches long by 12 inches in diameter." The description, draw-

ing of the masses, and numerous specimens of statoblasts also received, are 
all referable to the rectinatclla onagnifica. I bad been prepared for this an- 
nouncement by repeated information of medical students from the south- 
western portion of our country. Some of them have stated they had seen 
these jelly-like masses even as large as a half-bushel measure. Mr. Stimpson, 
the accurate naturalist, has informed me, that as early as 1850 he had detected 
large brain-like masses of Polyzoa attached to stones in the Middlesex canal, 
near Boston. As Pectinatella, so far as my observations go, has always been 
found attached to branches of trees, perhaps from the difference of habit, the 
brain-like masses may prove to be distinct. 
Dr. Leidy further exhibited drawings of a species of Fredericella, which is 
found in the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, near Philadelphia, and also in Lily 
Pond, near Newport. He has not yet positively ascertained whether the species 
is different from that found in Europe. He added, that two years since he had 
detected a species of Lophopus in the Schuylkill river, but he had not yet had 
leisure to determine its character.

BY JOHN CASSIN. 
During a cruise of the U. S. ship Portsmouth, Captain A. H. Foote, U. S. 
Navy, commanding, recently completed, a very interesting collection of birds 
and collections in other departments of Natural History were made by Dr. A. 
A. Henderson, Surgeon, U. S. Navy, and Member of this Academy. Mainly the 
birds were obtained at Hakodadi, in the Island of Jesso, the most northern ot 
the Empire of Japan, and in the Island of Luzon, Philippine Islands, and the 
collection contains so many species, little known and otherwise of high interest, 
that we have deemed it proper to prepare catalogues for publication. The pre- 
sent paper contains birds from Hakodadi, exclusively, but we propose shortly 
to give a catalogue of those from the Philippines, to include also another col- 
lection recently received from the same Islands. 
Though the fullest encouragement and every facility was cheerfully granted 
by Captain Foote, opportunities for collecting birds only presented, favorable 
in any considerable degree, at the two points mentioned. The U. S. ship 
Portsmouth, it will be remembered, was in the Chinese Seas during the recent 
troubles, and it was undoubtedly most fortunate for the interests of the United 
States that such an accomplished and efficient officer as Captain Foote was in 
command and so faithfully maintained and defended the dignity of his flag and 
the reputation of his country. 
The present collection was made at Hakodadi in October, 1857.

From Hakodadi. A single specimen in Dr. Henderson's collection is not in 
good plumage, but is interesting on account of its similarity in colors only to 
the common Passer montanus of Europe. It is, however, different from that 
species in having the bill stronger and the feet much larger, and in general 
appears to be a more robust bird. The toes in the present species are so much 
longer and thicker, that those of P. montanus^ (from France,) appear on com- 
parison to be quite feeble. It seems, in fact, to belong to Bonaparte's second 
division of the genus Passer^ (Consp. Av. p. 508,) though with the plumage of 
the type of the first division, P. montanus. 
This rather singular bird is very probably meant by Pallas in Zoog. as above 
cited, where he gives it as a species of eastern Siberia and probably also by 
Temminck and Schlegel under the name of P. inontamis. The distinguished 
authors last mentioned seem, however, not to have had specimens before them 
The name given by Pallas very probably ought to be re-established for this 
species.

larger than in Alauda arhorea,^ to which this species bears a resemblance and 
relationship. 
The tail in the present bird is quite as long as is usual in the genus Alauda^ 
and longer than in A. arborea. In several specimens the entire outer feather 
is white, in others a portion of the inner web is brown. It is quite distinct as 
a species. Hakodadi.

Frequent everywhere in the vicinity of Hakodadi, in trees and bushes, usu- 
ally several together. The voice of this species is quite similar to that of the 
Chickadee of the United States." â (Dr. Henderson.)

Parus kamtschatkensis, Bonap., Consp. Av. p. 230, (1850.) 
The only specimen that we have ever seen of a species allied to Parus palus- 
iris of Europe, but apparently suflaciently distinct. So far as we can judge 
from a very short description, it is the bird meant by the Prince Bonaparte as 
above cited. 
In this bird the upper .parts of the body are pale ashy, (" alho-canescens,^' 
Bonap.) paler than in Parus palustris and the tail is longer with all the feathers 
uniformly ashy brown, the edges only of the outer feathers being white. Head 
above and neck behind black, throat black, under parts white, with a very pale 
and dull. tinge of yellowish ashy on the abdomen and flanks. The black of the 
head extends on to the neck further than usual in species having this character. 
Bill rather stout. 
This species is an addition to the Japanese fauna made by Dr. Henderson.

the same size, but with the upper parts olive green, tinged with brown, and 
the under parts pale yellow, spotted on the breast with greenish brown, and 
with the sides and abdomen pale, reddish brown. Bill rather large, upper 
mandible and tip of under mandible brownish black, base of under mandible pale 
yellow; legs and feet strong; toes long; wing short, second quill longest; tail 
cuneate, dark brown ; outer feathers tipped with white. Upper parts dark 
olive green, tinged with brown, especially on the rump and upper tail coverts, 
obscurely spotted with brownish black on the head and back, line over the eye 
pale yellow. Under parts pale yellow, nearly white on the throat, with 
numerous greenish brown spots on the breast ; sides and tibire dark greenish 
brown; abdomen and under tail coverts very pale reddish brown; under wing 
white. Total length about 5^ inches, wing 2J, tail 2 inches. 
Hab. â Hakodadi, Island of Jesso, Japan. Discovered by A. A. Henderson,

tills though much resembling both, and strictly of the same subgeneric group. 
It is shorter in the wings and has larger legs and feet than either, and differs 
also in color. A single specimen only is in the present collection. 
No species of this group is enumerated in Temminck and Schlegel's Catalogue, 
nor do we find any description of an Asiatic species applicable to the present 
species. Its nearest relative is >S'. luscinioides. It may also be related to Locus- 
tella rubescens. Blyth. Jour. As. Soc. xiv. p. 582. 
14. LusciNiopsis Hendbrsonii, nobis. 
Resembling the preceding, but much smaller, and also resembling Sylvia locus- 
tella of Europe. Wings short, legs and feet large, toes long, tail rather wide, 
rounded. Upper parts dark olive green, with a tinge of brown, every feather 
with a central stripe of brownish black. Under parts yellowish white, breast 
with numerous small spots of brownish black, sides and tibise greenish brown, 
tail dark brown, abdomen, under tail coverts and under wing coverts with a 
tinge of very pale reddish. Bill with the upper mandible dark horn color, under 
mandible lighter, feet pale yellowish. Total length about 4^ inches, wing 2^, 
tail 1^ inches. 
Hah. â Hakodadi, Island of Jesso, Japan. Discovered by A. A. Henderson . 
M. D., U. S. Navy. 
This little bird appears to us to be of rather complex generic, or, perhaps, 
more properly, subgeneric relations, and would be quite as properly included 
in the genus Locustella as in Lutsciniopsis, and in fact bears considerable resem- 
blance and relationship to the European Sylvia locustella. It much resembles 
the preceding, having the same short wings, rounded tail, and very strong legs 
and long toes, but the bill is comparatively smaller. As will be seen by the 
measurements given, the present bird is much smaller than the preceding, and 
is smaller also than S. locustella. 
One specimen only in the collection made by Dr. Henderson, to whom we 
have dedicated this curious little species, his high position as an officer of the 
Medical corps of the Navy of the United States, and extensive acquirements 
also as a naturalist, fully justifying it, but especially his untiring energy in con- 
tributing to the ornithological collection of this Academy renders the present 
application of his name entirely appropriate. The present bird does not much 
resemble any species enumerated by Temminck and Schlegel.

the faith of a Japanese drawing. This bird cannot be distinguished from speci- 
mens labelled " Sitta uralensis^^^ in the Museum of this Academy, purporting to 
be from the north of Europe, and seems to be the same as represented in the 
figures cited above. 
On the trunks of coniferous trees forming groves behind the town of Hako-

northward a plain rises very gradually, which is dry near the shore, but two or 
three hundred yards beyond, are extensive grassy marshes. From these one 
or two small streams run to the Bay, before discharging into which they run 
for a mile or two nearly parallel to the beach, and frequently not more than

Notes on American Land Shells, No. 4. 
BY W. G. BINNEY. 
The following Catalogue of American Terrestial Mollusks, is offered in the 
hope of drawing attention to the subject, and by exciting criticism, to furnish 
the first step towards an arrangement of the confused synonomy. The list is 
necessarily incomplete, as but a small portion of the oldest States has been 
thoroughly searched, and an immense extent of territory remains quite unex- 
plored. 
The species of the Pacific coast north of Mazatlan, are catalogued separately. 
The Mexican species will be published in a subsequent paper. 
Reference is made only to authors giving a description or figure of each 
species.

The following extract from a letter of Mr. C. 0. Sanford, dated Pe- 
tersburg, Ya., Oct. 20th, 1858; was read. 
I was much interested in the slab of sandstone (mentioned on page 177,) 
showing the ripple marks on its opposite sides, at right angles, or nearly so, and 
although I thought I could account for it, I was not willing to venture an 
opinion until I could have access to my books. 
I send an extract from Calver, on the improvement of tidal rivers, which sa- 
tisfies me that the marks were not made by currents, but by waves caused by 
winds. 
1st. A wind produced the ridges upon the soft bed of sand. 
2d. That a deposit of sand was made upon these ridges, which in like man- 
ner was ridged by a ^ind blowing at a different angle from the first. One side 
of the slab is probably the impression of the ridges first made. 
Extract from a letter loriiten by an officer in the British Navy. 
" In 1838, while lying in one of H. M. ships, in the port of Santander, on the 
north coast of Spain, we observed, upon looking over the side at high water. 
and when the water was unusually clear, that the bottom, composed of sand^ 
was covered by ridges running paratlel to the waves that had been on the sur- 
face during a strong breeze of two or three days' duration, but which had bean 
succeeded by a calm. Our anchorage was within the harbor, and the wind off 
shore. The impression it made on my mind at the time was, that as the ridges 
lay at right angles to the direction in which the wind had been blowing, thev 
were occasioned by a motion given to the water at that depth by the waves at 
the surface. 
Our anchorage at high water (the time alluded to,) was forty feet. 
I do not think that the waves, from the crest to the lowest part of the hollow 
could have been more than five feet, as the wind was an off shore one upon that 
coast. 
The ridges were small, apparently not more than a foot in width, and so, 
not corresponding in magnitude with the waves on the surface, but only with 
their direction."

And were referred to Committees. 
Mr. Wm, Parker Foulke made a statement respecting the fossil bones, shells 
and wood presented by him to the Academy this evening. 
Passing the summer and autumn at Haddonfield, Camden County, New Jersey, 
Mr, Foulke learned that one of his neighbors, Mr. John E. Hopkins, while 
digging marl upon his farm, about twenty years ago, had found some bones. 
These were described as vertebrse, and as being of large size, and very numer- 
ous. Mr. Hopkins being young at the time of the discovery, and not specially 
interested in such subjects, had permitted visitors to carry away the fos- 
sils ; so that none remained in his own possession, nor could he remember the 
names of any of the persons by whom the vertebrae had been taken. Accord- 
ing to his recollection, no head had been found, nor any other bones than those 
of the spine, except one, which was said by him to have resembled, in general 
respects, a ^' shoulder blade." It appeared, then, not improbable that upon dig- 
ging around the old pit, (which was sixteen feet long and eight feet wide,) a 
head, or at least a portion of one containing teeth, might be obtained. Consid- 
ering the geological age of the formation upon which Haddonfield stands, and 
that specimens of Mosasaurus have been discovered in places not very remote 
from the village, there appeared sufficient motive for exploration. Mr. Hopkins, 
with an intelligent appreciation of the object proposed, gave to Mr, Foulke, with 
prompt liberality, permission to dig in any part of the farm, and to take away 
whatever fossils might be thus procured. There was some diflSculty in ascer- 
taining the place of the old excavation. It had been made in the bed of a 
narrow ravine, in which a brook flows eastwardly into the south branch of 
Cooper's Creek ; but the pit had long since been filled to the common level of 
the bed, and it was in like manner overgrown with grass, shrubs, and young 
trees, so as to be undistinguishable by the eye. After conference with one of 
the diggers who had been employed at the time of the discovery, (whose indica- 
tion proved to be inaccurate,) and after a careful survey of the vicinage by Mr. 
Hopkins, a party of experienced marl diggers were set at work ; and after one 
day's preliminary trial, the eastern side of the old pit was detected. In confor- 
mity with Mr. Hopkins' recollection of the manner in which the vertebrÂ£e lay, 
the party of diggers was shifted to the western side of the old pit. The super- 
ficial deposit overlying the marl here, was only about four feet thick; the ravine 
being between twenty and thirty feet deep. At nearly four feet further depth, 
a thin stratum of decomposed shells was passed ; and at about two feet below 
this, overlying and intermixed with another stratum of shells, the workmen 
came upon a pile of bones â the same now before the Academy. The total depth 
from the surface was between nine and ten feet.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
The marl being tenacious, great care was requisite to extricate the fossils. 
With a small trowel and a knife, the bones were carefully dissected from their 
bed, and from one another. A sketch was made of their position, and some 
measurements were taken of them, in anticipation of the contingency of their 
fracture in the attempt to remove them. Several lines of transverse fracture 
were observable before their position was changed. Each bone was separately 
transferred to a board, and thus carried from the pit, and then wrapped in a 
piece of coarse cloth. Thus enveloped it was laid upon a thick bed of straw 
in the bottom of a cart ; and the whole were safely transported in this way, 
about three quarters of a mile, to Mr. Foulke's residence. A small tooth and 
some fragments of a jaw were found with the other specimens. 
Mr. Isaac Lea and Dr. Leidy were informed of the discovery, and they 
promptly visited the excavation. Their opinion of the scientific value of the 
fossils justified further exploration; and the diggers were kept at work, from 
time to time as the weather permitted, during the month of October. 
Another tooth having been accidentally turned up by Mr. Foulke near the sur- 
face of the marl which had been thrown out, the entire mass was broken up 
and carefully raked over ; and by this process, in two or three days, the number 
of teeth increased to nine, and some useful fragments of jaw were also added 
to the collection. 
Various specimens of shells were obtained ; but their extreme friability ren- 
dered their preservation difficult. Several pieces of wood were found. The ex- 
cavation was carried quite around the old pit, and extended so as to form a con- 
siderable area for search ; but nothing further appeared, except a few vertebrae, 
and small fragments of other bones, and of wood, near the margin of the old 
pit. It seemed then useless to proceed, and the diggers were dismissed. 
One of the workmen, having become interested in the search, kept his atten- 
tion upon the subject ; and about a week afterward found, in the green marl 
near the White Horse tavern (about six miles southward from Haddonfield), some 
vertebrae, parts of long bones, and several teeth of a crocodile, believed to be of 
a species not heretofore found in New Jersey ; which are now in Dr. Leidy's hands 
for final examination. The workman stated that, at the bottom of all the dig- 
gings, casts of cucullea are found in great quantity. They are known at the pits 
by the name of "squirrel heads," from a fancied resemblance. Two specimens 
accompany the crocodile bones just mentioned. 
Subsequently, Drs. Leidy and LeConte and Mr. Foulke made a short tour 
among green marl pits, worked for sale of marl, southward of Haddonfield. On 
the road to the White Horse, they visited the large opening of Mr. Alexander 
Cooper, who stated that he knew of no bones being found there â certainly none 
during thirty years. Near the White Horse, it was said that bones had been 
thrown from all the diggings. At the extensive pit of Mr. Randall Morgan, on 
a south branch of Timber Creek, a short distance southward from Blackwood- 
town, a curious specimen of conglomerate of terebratulae and other shells was 
obtained. Bones had been recently found ; but they had been thrown away, 
and were lost, ^rom Mr. Charles Stevenson, in the same neighborhood, it was 
learned that in his pit, and that of Mr. Marshall, below Mr. Morgan's, bones had 
been repeatedly found, but no care was taken of them. In fact, within the last 
year Mr. Stevenson had thrown some portions into the yard between his house 
and barn. After a little raking, a few crocodile bones were discovered amongst 
leaves and dirt. Mr. King, a blacksmith at Blackwoodtown, was said to have 
collected a few bones as curiosities. Upon application being made to him, he 
stated that he had given, or loaned, or lost, nearly all of his stock ; but he pro- 
duced from the corner of his workshop, three specimens which Dr. Leidy imme- 
diately recognised as fragments of jaw of Mosasaurus, each containing a large 
portion of a tooth ; the three exhibiting very clearly the mode of dentition of 
the animal. 
These details were presented to the notice of the members, because they sugges- 
ted the probability that valuable illustrations of palaeontology and geology are 
annually lost through the ignorance of marl diggers or the inattention of own-

ers of pits. In view of the great promise of a region so near to Philadelphia, 
it is important that measures shall be taken to awaken in the minds of pro- 
prietors and workmen an interest in the preservation of specimens for the cab- 
inet of the Academy. 
It may be observed, upon inspection of the geological map of New Jersey, that 
aline drawn from the recent opening on Mr. Hopkins' farm, southwesterly in the 
direction of the exposure of the green sand formation, passes several miles west- 
ward of the green marl pits which were visited as just narrated. The marl at Mr. 
Hopkins' is, when in the pit, dark blue approaching black, micaceous, stiff, and 
tenacious. Upon free exposure to the air, it becomes, after a week or two, light 
bluish gray in color, and then it crumbles easily. From its not being consider- 
ed as good a fertilizer as the green marl, it has been rarely dug, of late, in that 
part of the country; and hence there is not an opportunity for collecting fossils, 
such as is furnished by the pits in the green marl. The latter deposit is more sea- 
ward ; and hence a diminished probability of finding in it the remains of ani- 
mals which lived upon land, or in the freshwater tributaries of the old ocean. 
Of the two exogyra presented on behalf of Mr. Robert Hare Powel, the smaller 
was dug, a number of years since, from Mr. Hopkins' farm. The larger, 
showing a curious peculiarity of growth, was taken more recently from a small 
excavation in Mr. Powel's ground, between Mr. Hopkins' and the main street. 
The diagram upon the table would make clear to the members the principal lo- 
calities which had been mentioned. 
The hard stone containing casts of shells, apparently belonging to the tertiary 
period, was found at about five miles south-eastward of Allowaystown ; and was 
presented in behalf of Mr. Isaac H. Wood, of Haddonfield. 
The sandstones on the table were not new nor rare; but they afford very 
good examples of the mode in which sand and gravel are converted into hard 
stone by a ferruginous cement. The specimens show interesting gradations of 
fineness, compactness and hardness. They came from the superficial deposit near 
Mr. A. Cooper's marl pit, where they lay loosely embedded. Similar stones are 
used in the neighborhood for coarse building purpoees. 
The bones found by Mr. Foulke, had been submitted by him to Dr. Leidy, for 
description ; the shells, to Mr. Lea; and the wood to Dr. Hammond. As these 
gentlemen were prepared to report the results of their inspection, Mr. Foulke 
restricted himself to the simple introductory narrative of facts just given ; resfr- 
ving to a future occasion some observations which had occurred to him respect- 
ing the succession of cretaceous deposits in New Jersey, and the relations of 
and and sea during the cretaceous period. 
Dr. Leidy stated that the bones, mentioned in the remarks of ^Ir. Foulke, ob- 
tained from the marl of Mr. Hopkins' farm, near Haddonfield, New Jersey, and 
now exposed to the view of the Society, were those of a huge herbivorous saurian. 
The animal was closely allied to the great extinct Ignanodon of the Wealden 
and Lower Greensand deposits of Europe ; the genus is, however, different, and 
for it the name of Hadrosaurus is proposed. 
Besides a number of small fragments, the bones consist of twenty-eight' 
vertebrae, mostly with their processes broken away; a humerus, a radius and an 
ulna, complete ; an ilium and a pubic bone, imperfect; a femur, a tibia and a 
fibula; two metatarsal bones and a first phalanx, complete. There are also in 
the collection nine teeth and a small fragment of the lower jaw. 
The bones are ebony black, from the infiltration of iron, and are exceedingly 
heavy. Their texture is firm and well preserved ; and they are neither crushed 
nor water rolled. In association with them, besides the shells and wood, were 
found several teeth of Odontaspis and Enchodus. 
Most of the specimens of teeth of the i7^^/(/ro5f?Â«rz/s appear to have belonged' 
to the lower jaw. These, when unworn and perfect, are about two inches long, 
and of all known teeth most resemble those of the Ignanodon. They have a 
demi-conoidal crown, with a lozenge-shaped enamel surface directed inwardly, 
and divided by a prominent median carina. The upper borders of this surface â¢ 
1858.] 

216 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
are provided with short, transverse, tuberculated ridges. The body of the 
crown outwardly is paraboloid in transverse section, and is prolonged into a 
laterally compressed conoidal fang. As the teeth were worn away from the 
summit, their gradually expanding triturating surface sloped downward and 
outward. This surface is shield-like in outline, is bordered by enamel in- 
ternally, and crossed by a slightly elevated crucial ridge with diverging 
branchlets. The ridge, resulting from the later ossification of the dental pulp, 
is harder than the surrounding dentine, and is adapted to retain a rough tri- 
turating surface. The sides and bottoms of the teeth exhibit the impres- 
sions of lateral and inferior successors, and appear to indicate that the teeth 
in use, together with those more or less developed within the jaw, had a quin- 
cuncial arrangement. 
Two of the specimens of teeth perhaps belong to the upper jaw. They differ 
from the others in the extraordinary degree of development of the median 
carina of the crown. The enamelled surface was perhaps directed in a re- 
verse manner to that of the lower teeth; that is to say, outwardly. It is like- 
wise lozenge-like in outline, and tuberculated at the lower borders. The body 
of the crown inwardly is half oval in section. The fang for more than half its 
width is prolonged from the carina of the crown. These teeth also exhibit 
the impress of successors holding the same relative position with one another 
as in the lower teeth. 
The fragment of the lower jaw is a portion of the left dentary bone, and is 
three inches in depth. It has an outer parapet wall about two inches high, 
with deep vertical grooves for the support of ihe teeth. No corresponding wall 
appears to have existed on the inner side of the latter. 
The cervical vertebrae have their bodies prominently convex in front and 
deeply concave behind, and would appear to indicate that Mantell was correct 
in assigning similar vertebrae, found in the Wealden deposits of England, to the 
Iguanodon. Tbree cervical vertebras, suspected to be the third, fourth, and 
fifth, are two and a half inches long at the sides. 
Five succeeding vertebrie, not immediately conjoining the ones just men- 
tioned, and supposed to be anterior dorsals, likewise have convexo-con- 
cave bodies. At the sides of the latter they are from 3 to 3|- inches long, and 
posteriorly are 3^ inches wide. The sides of their arch present a deep pit for 
the articulation of a rib ; but no articular mark is perceptible at the sides of 
the bodies. Two other vertebrae, perhaps posterior dorsals, have the bodies 
slightly prominent in front and slightly concave behind; and they are 3 J inches 
long at the sides, and 4| inches wide posteriorly. 
The caudal vertebrae possess articular surfaces for chevron bones ; and the 
specimens we possess, from diff'erent parts of the tail, give the following suc- 
cession of measurements of their bodies : length 2|- inches, breadth 5 inches ; 
length 3 inches, breadth 4i inches; length 3 inches, breadth 3 J inches; 
length 2| inches, breadth 2\ inches; length 2-J inches, breadth If inches. 
From the gradation of size of seventeen specimens in the collection, it may 
be estimated that there were originally about fifty vertebrae to the tail. This 
number maj^ be too great by about ten, but certainly not more. 
A caudal vertebra from near the middle of the tail has its arch and spinous 
process complete. The two latter together measure 11 inches long from the 
body, which is 4J inches deep. The addition of a chevron bone would indicate 
the tail of the animal, at its middle, to have been between one and a half 
and two feet in depth. 
The humerus is perfect, and is 23 inches long. Its breadth at the tuberosi- 
ties, between which the head projects midway, is 7 inches. The shaft above 
is compressed from without inwardly; its lower part is cylindroid, and near 
the middle of the bone measures 9| inches in circumference. At the condyles 
the transverse diameter is 5^ inches. Only a very short and narrow medullary 
cavity occupies the centre of the shaft. 
Both bones of the forearm are solid. The ulna is 23 inches long, and 7 
[Dec. 

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 
217 
inches in circumference at the middle. The radius is 20 inches long, and 6 
inches in circumference at the middle. 
A very great disproportion exists between the bones of the fore and hinder 
extremities. So much is this the case, that I was at first inclined to believe 
thej belonged to different animals. The disproportion is even greater than in 
the Iguanodon, as indicated by comparison with the remains of an individual of 
the latter, in the British Museum, known as the Maidstone specimen. 
The ilium has its two extremities broken away, and in its present condition is 
27 inches long. Its sacral articular surface is 12 inches long by 3 inches thick. 
The breadth of the bone, opposite the latter surface, is from 7 to 9 inches. A 
bone, which I suspect to be the pubic, but whicU appears to correspond with 
that, of the Maidstone Iguanodon, described as the clavicle, is 26 inches long in 
its present state ; one end being broken away. The remaining pubic extremity is 
lOJ inches wide. 
The thigh bone is 40 inches long ; its breadth at the head and adjoining tro- 
chanter is 9 inches ; its breadth at the condyles is 8 inches ; and the antero-pos- 
terior diameter of the internal condyle is 10 inches. The shaft is quadrate, and 
provided at its middle portion internally with a large trochanter. The cir- 
cumference of the shaft just above the latter is 17 inches ; just below it, 15 inches. 
The condyles in front enclose a large foramen terminating a groove descending 
from the shaft. Posteriorly, at the bottom of the intervening notch, they enclose 
a smaller foramen. The medullary cavity is of large size, and extends about 
half the length of the shaft through its middle portion. 
The tibia is 36} inches long ; its breadth at the upper part is 11 inches ; and 
its breadth below is 10 inches. Its shaft is narrow and cylindroid at the middle, 
where it measures 11| inches in circumference. From this position it rapidly 
expands towards the two extremities of the bone. The medullary cavity is very 
short and narrow. 
The two metatarsal bones are of robust proportions and are each about 11 inches 
long. The proximal jyhalajix of a toe is 6 inches long, and 5|: inches broad at 
base. 
If we estimate the number of vertebrae of the trunk of Hadrosaurus to have 
been the same as in the recent Crocodile and Iguana ; the number of sacral ver- 
tebrae to have been the same as in the Iguanodon ; and the number of caudal 
vertebrae to have been fifty ; the whole number of vertebrae would have been 
eighty. A calculation of the length of the specimens of vertebrae in our posses- 
sion, with a proper allowance of separation by intervertebral fibro-cartilages, 
and an addition of two and a half feet as an estimate of the length of the head, 
would give, as the total length of the animal, about twenty-five feet. 
The great disproportion of size between the fore and back parts of the skeleton 
of Hadrosaurus, leads me to suspect that this great extinct herbivorous lizard 
may have been in the habit of browsing, sustaining itself, kangaroo-like, in an 
erect position on its back extremities and tail. As we, however, frequently ob- 
serve a great disproportion between the corresponding parts of the body of re- 
cent and well known extinct saurians, without any tendency to assume such 
a position as that mentioned, it is not improbable that Hadrosaurus retained the 
ordinary prostrate condition, progressing in the manner which has been sus- 
pected to have been the case in the extinct batrachian of an earlier period, the 
Labgrinthodoti. 
Hadrosaurus was most probably amphibious ; and though its remains were 
obtained from a marine deposit, the rarity of them in the latter leads us to sup- 
pose that those in our possession had been carried down the current of a river, 
upon whose banks the animal lived. 
Occasionally uncharacteristic fragments of huge bones have been found in 
the green sand of New Jersey, (of which we have several in the collection of 
the Academy,) which I suspect to belong to Hadrosaurus. One of these speci- 
mens, exposed to the view of the members, indicates a much larger individual 
than the one whose remains have been presented this evening.

vancement of the great objects of this Academy. The name of the great extinct 
saurian will then appear as Hadrosaurus Foulkii. 
Mr. Lea remarked that the members must all feel under great oblig ations to their 
fellow m 'inber, W. Parker Fouike, Esq., for the conct-ption, the industry and per- 
severance which he has brouglit to the exliutnaiiuu of thesis various reliques 
of a former state of existence of orgmst^ms, tot^illy different from any which 
now live on the surface of the earth ; for there no longer now remains a single 
creation wiiich had life during the whole of the Cretaceous period. With the 
true spirit of scientific investigation he has en-ibLd geologists to examine tbese 
important remains of a former world, and with equal liberality he has placed 
the whole in the possession of the Academy. It was with very great pleasure 
that Mr. Lea assisted, with Dr. Leidy for a few days, by the invitation of their 
friend, during the progress of his successful labors. 
The result has been that one of the most interesting fossil animals on record 
has been ^dded to the fauna of this period, the bones of which have just been so 
happily illustrMted by Dr. Leidy. There wereals" numerous genera and species 
of Mollusca, as well as coniferous plants added to our p^laBontology and fossil 
botany. 
Geological science is indebted to our late fellow member, Prof. Vanuxem, for 
the identification ol the m<Ml beds of New Jersey and Delaware with the Cretace- 
ous group of Europe, but it was not then known in either country that there 
were so many subdivisions ut the group, and the exact parallelism of the green 
sand was not attempted to be traced. While studying in Paris, under the in- 
struction of Brogui irt,hp was led to the conclu . ion, from his previous exanination 
of man}"- of the^e " marl pits," with Mr. Lea, that the moUusca were the same 
which belonged to the upper beds of Brogniart's " Pelagiques." At that early 
period of our geological history, when he was (examining the Paris basin, he 
was convincei, in 1818, ihat the alluvial of Maclure consisted of -'secondary, 
tertiary, and alluvial masses." Subsequently, in January, 1828, his notes were 
published in the Journal of this Academy,* and he gave a tabular view of the 
*â¢ relative geological position" of the secondary, tertiary, and alluvial forma- 
tions of the United States. He also defined their " geographical position," and 
stated that " this bed, (green sand), vi^as argillaceous, and contained greenish 
particles analog uis to tliose which are found in the green sand, or chalk, of 
Europe," and th;it it was "characterised by six genera, viz., Terebratula, Gry- 
phiBU, Ezogyr 1^ Ammnnitps, Baruliies and BeLemnites.'" These views of Professor 
Vanuxem were subsequently confirmed in various papers, al-o published in the 
Academy's Journal, by Dr. Morton, who, in his â ' Synopsis of Organic Remains," 
published in 1834, page 7, says that " Mr. Vanuxem was the first io detect the 
analogy between this deposit (Ferruginous sand,) and tne chalk formation of 
Europe."' Other geologists in various papers and state repoi ts have, by their 
developments, confirmed the opinions of Prof. Vanuxem, and from year to year 
new explorations have tended to demonstrate the vast extent of the Cretaceous 
Formation in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. 
The Cretaceous Formation commences at Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts, 
is largely developed in New Jersey, and is found in Dela ware, Maryland, Vir- 
ginia and the Carolinas. In Georgia, it is more largely d^velojied. Here, 
sweeping round the inferior Strata, the Primary, Silurian, and Carboniferous 
masses, it continues in a very enlarged band in a northerly direction, through 
Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, to near the mouth of the Ohio River. 
Crossing the Mississippi River, it descends to the south-west, through Arkan- 
sas, where on the upper waters of the Red River it expands to the n rih, thi oiigh 
Nebraska Territory, far into the British Possessions east of the Kocky Moun-

tains, embracing the head waters of the River Saskatchewan.* To the west, 
from Red River, it extends to and beyond Santa Fe, embracing the head waters 
of the Colorado, and stretching north-west, reaches the head waters of the Co- 
lumbia, as well as those of the Missouri River. Following a south-western 
direction from Red River through Texas, it crosses the Rio G-raude into New 
Leon, and thence south through St. Luis Potosi, it passes indefinitely into Mexico. 
In all the great extent of this formation, there is evidence of the cretaceous 
period^ while most of the species differ from our eastern fauna, as the lithologi- 
cal characters do in the rocks and sediments. 
In New Jersey, the green sand beds are but slightly calcareous, the limestone 
lying above having about 80 per cent, of lime. In North and South Carolina, it is, 
according to Pro. Tuomey, " 25 to 30 per cent, of the mass," but in Alabama it 
is " highly calcareous." 
This vast extent of a simultaneous deposit of this kind, is calculated to excite 
the greatest interest, when we consider how much it affects our agricultural pros- 
perity ; and in a geological point of view, it has received the attention of many 
of our ablest investigators. 
Prof. Vanuxem, in the first place, had in view, the division of McClure's " al- 
luvial," and in his paper he gives a table, dividing it into secondary, tertiary, 
and alluvial. To these he gave seven subdivisions â two only to the secondary, 
No. 1, being "Marl of New Jersey and Delaware," which he refers to the" green 
sand, or chalk of Europe." 
Dr. Morton, in his " Synopsis of Organic Remains," (page 13,) in 1834, six 
years subsequently, gives in a table the same three grand divisions, with a 
difference in the subdivisions, assigning the name of Ferruginous sand" to 
the lower division in which Prof. Vanuxem had continued the name of " Marl 
of New Jersey," the equivalent of" green sand, or chalk of Europe." Subse- 
quently, in June, 1835, in an appendix, page 89, he separates the "Cretaceous 
deposits of America" into three divisions, the " Upper, Media!, and Lower." 
In 1840, Prof. H. D. Rogers published his Report on the Geology of New Jer- 
sey, in which he separated the cretaceous group into five divisions, under the 
name of " the upper secondary series, embracing the green sand formation." 
1. A group of sands and clays, extremely white and pure, 
2. A mixed group, consisting of green sand, alternating with and occasionally 
replaced by layers of a blue, sandy, micaceous clay, the so-called "green sand 
formation. ' 
3. A yellowish, granular limestone, having a profusion of organic remains. 
4. A yellow, very ferruginous coarse sand, with some fossil shells of the 
green sand formation. 
5. A coarse, brown, ferruginous sandstone, sometimes passing into a con- 
glomerate. 
Subsequently, in Johnston's Physical Atlas, 1855, under the name of "Newer 
Mesozoic," he continues these divisions, the whole thickness of which he pre- 
sumes to be a thousand feet. 
Prof. Tuomey, in the tables of his geological survey of South Carolina, in 
1848, calls the New Jersey deposits " upper green sand;" those of South Caro- 
lina, " the gault;" those of Alabama, tbe lower green sand, equivalent to the 
Neocomien of the French geologists. 
In 1854, Messrs. Hall and Meek made a communication to the American 
Academy of Arts and Sciences, on some fossils from the Cretaceous Formation 
of Nebraska. This they divide into five sections. 
5. Arenaceous clay passing into argillo-calcareous sandstone. 
4. Plastic clay, the principal fossiliferous bed of the upper Missouri. 
3. Calcareous marl, containing Ostrea congesta^ &c. 
2. Clay containing few fossils.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 
In 1855, Mr. Marcou published, in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of 
France, an account of the Geology of the United States, in the cretaceous di- 
vision of which, (page 70,) after giving to Prof. Vanuxem the credit of being 
the first to detect this group in the United States, he says that it may be di- 
vided provisionally into " three great groups," which have been named in Eu- 
rope, 1st, le Neocomien ; 2d. le gres vert superieur et la craie marneuse ; 3d, 
la craie blanche. 
In March, 1856, Mr. Meek and Dr. Hayden, published their section of the 
Cretaceous formation of Nebraska, in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural 
Sciences, which they republished more fully in the following November, also in the 
Academy's Proceedings. 
5. Gray and yellowish arenaceous clays, with great numbers of marine mol- 
lusca, few land plants and bones of Mosasaurus. 
4. Bluish and dark plastic clay, containing numerous marine Mollusca. 
3. Lead gray calcareous marl, with scales of fishes. Ostrea congesta, Inocera- 
musj &c. 
2. Dark gray laminated clay, with scales of fishes, small ammonites, &c. 
1. Heavy bedded yellowish sandstone, with water-worn lignite. This forma- 
tion they say may not belong to the cretaceous system. 
Prof. Hall in his Geological Report, August, 1856, connected with Major 
Emory's Mexican Boundary Survey, gives an excellent table prepared by Prof. 
G. H. Cooke, of the New Jersey Survey, which divides the whole of this system 
in New Jersey into eight members, which may be thus suscinctly given : â 
8, Green Sand, 3d or upper bed. 
7. Quartzose Sand, 
i fa. Green Sand, 2d bedâ (a) JEschara, &c. 
w I (b) Gryphcea, &c.

oS ^ I 4. Green Sand, 1st or lower bed â Ezogyra^ Ostrea, &c.

2. Dark colored clay â Fossil wood, no animal remains. 
1. Fire Clay and Potter's Clay â Fossil wood and leaves, no animal 
remains. 
In May 1857, Mr. Meek and Dr. Hayden, in the Proceedings of the Academy, 
continued their valuable papers on the Tertiary and Cretaceous formation of 
Nebraska, and gave a table of equivalents with the New Jersey deposits, and 
Dr. Hayden in June of the same year made a communication entitled " Expla- 
nations of a second edition of a geological map of Nebraska and Kansas," in 
which the whole series of formations is reviewed, including the cretaceous 
system. 
It is a very important matter in discussing these organic remains to ascertain, 
as nearly as possible, the horizon on which this particular formation would 
stand in regard to its parallelism with those of Europe, where so much has been 
written on the subject of the various members of the Cretaceous group. 
Sir Charles Lyell says, that the New Jersey " strata consist chiefly of green 
sand and green marl, with an overlying coraline limestone of a pale yellow col- 
or, and the fossils, on the whole, agree most nearly with those of the upper Eu- 
ropean series from the Maestricht beds to the gault inclusive." ^' 
Professor Rogers in his New Jersey Report, does not seem to agree with this 
idea ; he " does not regard these strata as the equivalents in the strict sense of 
the word, of the green sand formation, so called, of Europe" (page 178). "Nor 
are we able," he says, " positively to decide, merely by the relationship of the 
genera, whether the cretaceous period embraces both the commencement and 
termination of the American green sand series" (page 179). 
M. D'Orbigny f considers the chalk formation of North America to belong to

221 
his " etage senonien" (the upper chalk of Morris) and not to the "gres verts," 
as supposed by Dr. Morton and others. 
Dr. Mantell consideied that the teeth of the Mosasaurus, found in the green 
sand formation of New Jersey, described by Dr. Harlan, were in every respect 
analogous to those of the Maestricht reptile, and that the deposit was equivalent 
to the Maestricht bed. 
The Blackdown green sand of Dr. FittonJ has in its fossil mollusca a very 
strong resemblance to our green sand fossils, and as D'Orbigny makes this for- 
mation an equivalent to his Cenomanien, there is some evidence that the New 
Jersey green sand may be on the same horrizon; for according to D'Orbigny's ta- 
bles the genus Belemnites ceases with the Cenomanien, and we have abundance 
of that genus in our green sand formation. If he be correct as to the decadence 
of the Cephalopoda, then we could not place this formation higher up in the se- 
ries than his Cenomanien, which is the " Glauconie crayeuse " of Brogniart, found 
at Cap le Heve in France, the Blackdown green sand of Fitton and the Upper 
green sand of Mantell in the south of England. 
Under all the information, we have, however, from the various investigations 
made by so many distinguished geologists, T think the evidence is in favor of 
D'Orbigny's opinion, that the green sand formation, from which these fossil re- 
mains were exhumed, belong to his Senonien, but it may prove upon further ex- 
amination to be a little lower ia the Cretaceous series. 
That portion of the grey micaceous clay at Haddonfield, in which the Mol- 
lusca^ all marine, were generally found, was some ten feet from the surface of 
the soil. The declination of the layer is very gentle and towards the south 
east. The bones and coniferous wood were so near or interspersed with the 
shells as to tend to prove that they must have lived in the vicinity of the shores 
which the Mollusca inhabited, for these show that they were deposited in a 
sediment totally and completely at rest. The most tender and delicate forms 
remain without abrasion, and usually, in the case of the bivalves, the two valves 
are attached. The great tenacity, however, of the clay, and the extreme ten- 
derness of the shells, render it almost impossible to get out perfect specimens, 
and when they come under the action of the atmosphere, and become de- 
siccated, the calcareous matter crumbles to pieces, the base membrane compos- 
ing the animal portion of the shell having been previously entirely absorbed. 
I propose here to give a hasty list of the genera which were collected, reserv- 
ing for a future time, when more at leisure, the specific diflFerences of those 
which are new. It will be observed that the Lamellibranchia greatly prevail 
over the Gasteropoda. 
List of Genera : â Pinna, I species ; Inoceramus, 2 do. ; Ostrea, 3 do. ; Anomia, 
1 do. ; Corbula, 2 do. ; Area, 1 do. ; Cardita, 1 do. ; Exogyra, 1 do. ; Siliquaria,

Dr. Hammond observed in relation to the fragments of fossil wood found in 
the same locality as the bones and shells described this evening by Dr. Leidy 
and Mr. Lea, that he had submitted them to a careful examination, the details 
of which might prove of interest to the Academy. 
Upon inspecting the pieces of this wood placed upon the table, it will be per- 
ceived that they are all of an intensely black color, but differ greatly in degree 
of hardness. One specimen is so soft as to crumlble readily on the slightest 
handling; whilst another is dense and hard, and capable of receiving a high 
polish. Several of the fragments exhibit teredo perforations, a circumstance of con- 
siderable interest. These perforations are so completely filled with sulphuret of 
iron that casts of them are readily obtained. All the fragments are more or less im-

pregnated with this mineral. In some parts the organic tissue has been entirely 
* removed, and nodules of the sulphuret have taken its place ; in others the mineral 
has entered the cells and tubes of the wood, leaving these of their natural forms. 
Occasionally perfect casts of the cells are found detached from the tissue when 
the specimen is mounted in Canada balsam. 
It was of course highly desirable that these woods should be submitted to 
microscopical examination. He found, however, upon trial that it was impossible 
to cut satisfactory sections without removing the sulphuret of iron. This was 
done by macerating pieces of the wood in dilute chlorhydric acid. After this pro- 
cess they were readily cut into sections with a suitable knife, or ground down 
till the requisite degree of tenuity was obtained. 
Sections thus obtained when placed under the microscope showed conclu- 
sively that the wood was of the coniferous family of plants. For some time Dr. 
H. was under the impression that one fragment belonged to an entirely different 
class. This idea arose from the fact that from an examination of eight or ten 
vertical sections none of the characteristic pits or cells could be perceived, nor 
any indication of the existence of medullary rays. Finally, however, he obtained 
a section which exhibited both very clearly, and a transverse section which pre- 
viously he was unable to cut, positively determined it to be of the same 
character as the other pieces. 
Some cause or other, probably the carbonizing process, had entirely destroyed 
the pits which had existed ; a fact of some importance in investigations of this 
nature. All the fragments appear to belong to the same species of conifer, and 
as far as Dr. H. could judge do not differ essentially in microscopic characters 
from the pines which now grow on the locality, 
Mr. T. Edwards Clark had kindly given him some specimens of a fossil wood 
described by linger, which in many respects resembles that referred to, the pits 
being absent from a large portion of the tisgue. 
Oa leave granted, the thanks of the Academy were tendered to his

Ichthyological Notices. 
BY CHARLES GIRARDj M. D. 
I. 
Those interested in the study of American animals, and of fishes in particular, 
will hear with interest, of the discovery recently made, of a representative of 
the Myxinoid family on the north-eastern coast of this continent. It belongs 
to the genus 3Iyxine^ so carefully and skilfully investigated by Joh. Miiller. 
It is the more interesting to comparative anatomists, as it typifies the lowest 
grade of the vertebrated plan of structure. The species which we allude to 
closely resembles the European one, 31. glutinosa; like it, it is an inhabitant of 
a rather high latitude, and its habits or mode of living are quite as little under- 
stood. The only specimens that were ever found were collected by my friend, 
W. Stimpson, who gave most of his specimens to Prof. Agassiz, reserving but 
one, which he deposited in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. 
The latter specimen is eleven inches and a half long : the thoracic region 
alone is subcylindrical ; the abdominal and caudal regions being quite com- 
pressed and somewhat tapering. The dorsal fin begins somewhat posteriorly 
to the branchial apertures as a mere fold of the skin, increasing very slightly 
in elevation towards the spear-shaped tail, being highest posterior to the vent. 
The latter, in the form of an elongated split, is situated nearly an inch and a 
half from the tip of the tail where the anal fin meets with the dorsal, of which 
it has both the aspect and development. A membranous fold or abdominal fin, 
a good deal more developed than the dorsal one just alluded to, may be observed 
all along the abdominal region, from the vent to the branchial apertures, being 
continuous with the anal fin, properly so called, the vent itself not affecting 
materially its continuity, since it is partly situated between a double fold at 
the origin of the anal fin. As regards the branchial apertures themselves, the 
left one is larger than the right, which is placed somewhat in advance and side- 
ways of the left; they are situated about three inches from the apex of the 
snout. The double series of abdominal mucous pores (one on either side), are 
conspicuous upon the removal of the slimy investment; the pores being about 
an eighth of an inch apart. The head is small, continuous with the body ; its 
anterior aspect is shelving inwardly downwards, the snout being subconical, at 
the apex of which may be observed four subequal tentacles closely grouped 
together, directed upwards and inserted, two on either side, upon the very edge 
of the spiracle which they seem to protect, together with a small flap at its 
posterior margin. The buccal aperture is anterior, below the declivity of the 
snout; it is divided into two parts by a lateral convoluted lip. the upper part 
being subtriangular or subcordiform, the lower part transverse and elongated ; 
its lower periphery is rumpled. The third pair of tentacles is the largest of all, 
and inserted, one on either side, near the upper and outer edge of the convoluted 
lateral lip just alluded to. It hangs downwards like the fourth pair, which is 
the smallest and rather inconspicuous, inserted near the inner and lower edge 
of the same convoluted lip, over the lovrer part of the buccal aperture. Thus 
the eight tentacles constitute four pairs : two rostral pairs presiding over the 
spiracle ; and two buccal pairs presiding over the mouth, one at the upper part, 
the other at the lower. The palatine tooth is slender and elongated. The four 
rows of lingual teeth are composed each of seven sublanceolated and acute 
teeth, much larger in the interior than in the posterior rows. They are very 
crowded and inclined backwards or rather inwards ; the anterior row over- 
lapping the base of the posterior one. 
The color is of a uniform reddish brown or chestnut tint, somewhat lighter 
beneath than above. The membranous fold along the abdomen being whitish. 
The head and anterior aspect of the snout, tentacles and mouth, are whitish 
also. 
From the foregoing remarks it is easy to perceive that we have on the Ameri-

can coast a distinct species of the genus Myxine, chiefly to be distinguished 
from its European analogue, by the external aspect of the snout, and buccal 
aperture, the insertion and proportional development of the tentacles, the form 
of the body, and by the presence of a membraneous fin-like expansion along the 
abdomen. To distinguish it henceforwards we propose calling it M. limosa. It 
was collected in great abundance on muddy bottoms, off the island of Grand 
Manan, Bay of Fundy. by fifty fathoms of depth.

Sometime during the month of September last, a "giant herring," as it was 
called by fishermen, was caught off Long Island ; its total length being five 
fe^t, and its weight forty-seven pounds. The trophy was brought to New 
Haven, where, after a preliminary survey, the prize was cut into pieces, and 
sold for the table. My friend Wm. H. Dougal, of Georgetown, D. C, well 
known as an artist of the first order, happening to be at New Haven at the time, 
and struck at the beauty of a fish, which he had never seen before, drew up an 
accurate outline of its body and fins, counted the rays of the fins, and the scales 
of the lateral line, preserving at the same time a few scales taken upon various 
regions of the body. With these materials on hand, and which we owe to his 
friendship, we have been enabled to refer this fish, not only to its family and 
proper genus, but its specific characters to a certain extent could likewise be 
analysed. 
In 1846, Valenciennes withdrew the genera Ulops and Megalops from the her- 
ring family {Chipeidce)^ in which they were formerly included, and proposed to 
erect for them the family of Elopidce. The genus Megalops was framed by Com- 
raerson upon a species of the Indian Ocean, the history of which got interwoven 
with one from the West Indies, until Valenciennes established their specific dif- 
ference, callirg the former M. indicus, and the latter 31. atlaniicus. It is to be 
regretted that the West Indian fish is not more fully described; Valenciennes 
description being brief and comparative with that of the East Indian species. 
It is nevertheless sufficient to establish the fact that the " giant herring" brought 
to New Haven, has a more elongated and subfusiform body, a more elongated 
head, an eye so much smaller that it never could have suggested the generic 
name of Big-Eye {Megalopis). The ventral fins are also inserted more in advance 
of the anterior margin of the dorsal fin. The latter is subtriangular and rather 
small, its posterior elongated ray not extending as far as the base of the caudal ; 
whilst the anal is long and very low, deeply imarginated upon its lower edge, 
which has the shape of an open crescent, the posterior ray being elongated 
and extends as far as the rudimentary rays at the lower lobe of the caudal. The 
formula of the rays is: D 13 ; A 24 ; C 20 ; V9; P 14. The rudimentary 
rays of the caudal not being taken into account, the number given to that fin 
appears a good deal smaller than in the other species of the genus, when in re- 
ality it is identical. The scales are deeper than long, rounded off, scalloped 
upon their anterior margin, and undulated upon the upper, posterior and lower 
margins. Fifty of them were counted in the lateral line. Three or four radiating 
furrows may be observed upon their anterior section only. A silvery tint pre- 
vails all over the body and head ; the dorsal region, however, assuming a much 
darker hue than the middle of the flanks and the belly. The coloration is near- 
ly alike in all the species of this genus. Frcm the characters alluded to, we in- 
fer the existence of a species hitherto undescribed, allied to M. atlaniicus, and 
for which we propose the name of if. elongains. It is probable that its habitat 
is the gulf of Mexico, and that the specimen caughtoff Long Island is a strayed 
individual that has followed the gulf stream on a northwards journey.

Since my report upon the Fishes of the U. S. P. R. R. Explorations and Sur- 
veys has passed through the press, new facts relating to the history of the 
salmons of the Columbia River have come to our knowledge, calling for various 
[Dec.

rectifications of sj'nonymy. The species which is figured and described under 
the name of Fario gairdneri is not the Salmo gairdneri of Sir John Richardson. 
Nor does it appear to be any of the other species recorded in the " Fauna 
Boreali Americana." To distinguish it henceforwards from its congeners we 
will call it Fario neivberrii, or else Salmo newberrii^ just as it may suit systematic 
writers. It is sufficient for the present to refer to the description alluded to 
above. 
My friend Dr. Geo. Suckley, who has devoted much time in studying the 
manners and habits of the Salmonidae of Uregon and Washington Territories, 
being now engaged on a work upon that family, I leave the rest of the subject 
with him, without further comment upon the specimens which he has himself 
collected, 
IV. 
In that same Report upon the Fishes of the TJ. S. P. R. R. Explorations and 
Surveys we have instituted the genus Tlialeichthys upon a species of Salmonid 
which we had at first glance referred to the genus Osmerus. In treating of its 
characters, comparatively with both Osmerus and Argentina^ to which genera it 
is closely allied, we omitted accidentally to compare it with the genus Mallotus, 
to which it bears some affinities, but from which it however differs by a more 
anterior position of the dorsal and ventral fins, by its small and lanceolated 
pectorals, and by the absence of maxillar teeth. As to the species referred to 
under the name of Thaleichthys stevensi, a further examination having shown 
its identity with Salmo {Mallotus?) pacificus of the "Fauna Boreali Americana/' 
it is henceforwards to be designated under the name of Thaleichthys pacificus.

Description of New Genera and Species of Wortli American Lizards in the 
Mnsenm of the Smithsonian Institution. 
BY SPENCER F. BAIRD. 
Family IGUANID^. 
EtJPHRYNE, Baird. â Body very heavy aad clumsy. Tail shorter than the 
body; very thick and conical. Scales very small, but imbricated and angular 
throughout. A median dorsal band of about 20 rows, and a largepatch on 
%he sides of scales larger than the rest. Infra-orbitals in a series of small, 
nearly equal plates. Supra-cephalic plates all small, least on the outer part of 
the supra-orbital region. Upper labials rectangular, not imbricated. Posterior 
molars with five cusps; palate toothed. Claws very thick and stout, anterior 
much the longer. 
Euphryne obesus, Baird. â Width of head nearly equal to distance from nose to 
ear. Tail shorter than the body. General color of the young, olive green, with 
live broad transverse bars above from head to base of tail, and about as many 
oa the tail ; these rings yellow, dotted with red. Beneath pea green dotted with 
black. With increasing age, the bands become obsolete and disappear, the 
general color becoming reddish olive. 
The largest and heaviest of American Iguanidce, sometimes exceeding a foot 
in length. Abundant in the canons of the Colorado, of California, collected b}^ 
-Maj. Thomas, Mex. Boundary Survey, and Lt. Ives' Expedition. Type No. 41*72 
Crotapkytus reticulatus, Baird. â Infra-orbital chain in a series of 6 or 8 nearly 
equal plates. Scales on the gular fold much smaller than those between the 
fore legs. Above ashy gray, with a hexagonal reticulation of lighter, the in- 
terstices here and there dark brown. Chin and throat reticulated. Neither 
black collar nor light spots. More closely related to Crotaphytus coUaris, than 
to Crotaphytus (^Gambelia) wislizenii. 
Hah. â Laredo and Ringgold Barracks, Tex. Mex. Boundary Survey. J. H. 
Clark and A. Schott. Type 2692. 
Uta symmetrica^ Baird. â Larger dorsal scales in four regular series, two on 
either side of the median smaller ones. Head short, depressed, one and a half 
times as wide as deep. Tail one and a half times the head and body. General 
color light brown above, the belly white. Sides with broad transverse bands 
of blackish. Size of U. ornata. 
Hah.â Fori Yuma, Cal. Mex. Boundary Survey. A. Schott. Type No. 2760. 
Uta schottii, Baird. â Dorsal scales and size as in the last. Head pointed, 
narrow, nearly or quite as high as wide. General color nearly black, scarcely 
lighter beneath. Back with small blue spots. Tail banded laterally with the 
same. 
Hah. â Sta. Madelina, Cal. Mex. Boundary Survey. A. Schott. Type No. 
2761. 
Uma, Baird. â Ears distinct. very long infra-orbit '] plate. Palate without 
teeth. Outer face of upper labials plane and broadly v cal ; the labials them- 
selves much imbricated, and very oblique. Scales of body above equal, much 
smaller than ventral ones. Inter-orbital space with two series of plates. Claws 
very long, slender and straight. Sides with a round black spot. Tail ? 
(broken off.) 
Uma notata, Baird. â Head about two-fifths the head and body. Above light 
pea green, spotted with darker green. Beneath white. Head and body about 
two inches long. 
Hah. â Mohave Desert. Lt. Williamson, Dr. A. L. Heermann. Type No. 4124. 
HolbrooMa approzimans, Baird. â Similar in size and general character to //. 
maculata. Tail shorter than body. Two small vertical indigo black patches 
on the side of belly, entirely visible from' below ; with a light blue areola. 
1858.]

TROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 
Central point of belly about opposite the middle point between the two patchse. 
No light stripe on side of neck. Upper parts and sides gray, sprinkled with 
whitish. Head broad, very convex above. Hind foot about one-third the 
head and body. 
Hah. â Lower Rio Grande. Mex. Boundary Survey, and Lt. Couch. 
Sceloporus floridanus, Baird. â Cephalic plates smooth. Three series of supra- 
orbitals, a broad central one, and an external and internal of very small plates. 
Scales large, rough. 33 oblique rows of dorsal scales from head to anns. 
Scales on inside of tibia carinated. Free portion of longest hind toe exceed- 
ing the cephalic plates. Color above greenish yellow, with two broad yellow 
stripes, five scales apart. Back with distinct transverse blackish bars. Larger 
than S. undulatus. 
Pensacola, Fla. Dr. Jeffries, U. S. N. Type No. 2874. 
Sceloporus ornatus, Baird. â Dorsal scales in about 64 oblique series, with but 
slight carination, mucronation and denticulation. Femoral pores 12. A well 
marked black cervical collar, complete above, and margined with yellowish. 
Color dark green above, nearly black towards the median line. Back with 
email yellowish spots. 
Patos, Coahuila, Lt. Couch. Type No. 2845. 
Sceloporus longipes, Baird. â Similar to S. occidentalism in general characters of 
shape, coloration and smoothness of the scales on inside of tibia. Limbs and 
tail much lengthened. Free portion of hind toe longer than the cephalic plates. 
The hind leg as long as the body and neck. Hind foot contained about two and 
a half times in the head and body. 
Fort Tejon, Cal. John Xantus. Type No. 4358. 
Sceloporus coucJm, Baird. â General appearance of S. marmoratus, Hall. Cepha- 
lic plates smooth. Scales very small. About 80 oblique dorsal rows from 
head to tail. Femoral pores 25. Color above dark green, with two lateral 
light stripes, separated by 18 rows of scales. Back with irregular spots. 
Sides with a white band from groin. An obsolete dark indigo patch on each 
side the belly, widely separated below. Sides of jaw banded transversely with

BY F. B. MEEK AND E, V. HAYDEN. 
The Cretaceous system as developed in Nebraska, is clearly divisible into five 
distinct formations, which have, for the sake of convenience, been numbered 
1, 2, 3, &c., from the base upwards. Although at first entertaining some doubts 
as to whether No. 1, or the lowest formation, might not be older than Creta- 
ceous, we always placed it provisionally, in our published sections, in the Cre- 
taceous system. More recently, after a careful review of the subject, we became 
satisfied from the modern affinities of numerous dicotyledonous leaves found in 
this formation, that we hazarded little in regarding it as a settled question that 
it could not be older than Cretaceous, and so expressed ourselves in our paper 
read before the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, March, 1858. 
The reference of this formation to the Cretaceous, however, was not without 
some exceptions generally admitted, for Professor Jules Marcou, in his work on 
the " Geology of North America," page 143, refers it to the New Red Sandstone, 
and in a subsequent publication,- he places it in the Jurassic ; while some in- 
vestigators in this country also inclined to the opinion that it must be Triassic. 
In the midst of these conflicting opinions, although satisfied we were right, we 
wished, in order to remove all doubts from the minds of others, to have the 
opinion of some good authority in fossil botany, (a department of palseontolo-

gy to which we have given little attention,) respecting the fossil leaves onwhic-h 
we mainly based our views in regard to the age of this formation. Consequent- 
ly, we sent outline sketches of a few of them to Professor Oswald Heer,* the 
distinguished authority in fossil botany at Zurich, Switzerland, informing him 
they were from a formation we regarded as Cretaceous and requesting him 
to let us know to what genera and geological epoch he would refer them. 
This letter was sent to Professor Heer in August last, before we Btarted to Kansas, 
and on our return, in the latter part of October, we were disappointed at find- 
ing no reply from him. After waiting some days longer, and receiving no an- 
swer from Professor Heer, we concluded our letter had either failed to reach 
him, or that he was unwilling to express an opinion based upon mere sketches 
of the leaves ; consequently we submitted the whole to Dr. Newbury, who had 
then returned to Washington, and in whose opinion on this subject we have the 
fullest confidence. 
After examining the specimens, Dr. Newbury gave us a written statement 
bearing date Nov. 12, containing a list of the genera to which he had referred 
the leaves, together with some interesting remarks and generalizations, in which 
he expressed the opinion that they are certainly Cretaceous, some of them be- 
longing to genera peculiar to that epoch, and that the whole belong to more 
highly organized plants than anything known in the Triassic or Jurassic flora. 
Knowing as we did that the rocks from which these plants were obtained, 
â beyond all doubt, â hold a position beneath, at least, eight hundred feet of 
Cretaceous strata, containing great numbers of Ammonites, Scaphites, Baculiies, Â«f-c., 
it of course never once occurred to us that any person might suppose it 
Tertiary. 
About the thirteenth of November we sent on to the American Journal of 
Science, a communication containing Dr. Newbury's list of the genera to which 
he had referred our plants, with some extracts from his remarlcs, all of which 
will appear in the January number of that Journal. Some two or three weeks 
after we had corrected the last proof of this paper, we received (13th of Dec.) 
a letter from Professor Heer, bearing date of Nov. 20, in which he informed ws 
that our letter had reached him at a late date, in consequence of his absence 
from home, and that after his return, other engagements had prevented him from 
replying sooner. In this letter Professor Heer, in accordance with our request, 
sent us a list of the genera, as near as it was possible for him to make them out 
from hastily drawn sketches, and also kindly furnished brief diagnoses of the 
species,! stating at the same time that although one of the outlines resembles 
a Cretaceous genus (Credneria,) the nervation being obscure, and the others 
being more like Tertiary forms than anything known in the Cretaceous of the 
old world, he was inclined to the opinion that they are Tertiary. 
Along with Professor Heer's letter, we also received a printed pamphlet, en- 
titled " Letters on some points of the Geology of Texas, New llexico, Kansas and 
Nebraska; addressed to Messrs. F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, by Jules Marcou." 
In this pamphlet Professor Marcou quotes Professor Heer's conclusions in re- 
gard to our fossil plants, and expresses the opinion that No. 1, of the Nebraska 
section, is both Miocene and Jurassic, or in other words, that we have included 
in it strata belonging to each of these two widely different geological epochs. 
Having a very high regard for Professor Heer's opinions on any question in 
fossil botany, where he has had an opportunity to examine the specimens them- 
selves, or to study good figures and descriptions, we are quite sure, had the 
whole collection been submitted to him, instead of mere sketches of a few of 
the species, his opinion would have been very dilferent. At any rate, we can 
assert with the fullest confidence that it is absolutely impossible that this forma- 
tion, or any part of it, can be Tertiary, for we know it passes, as already stated, 
beneath at least eight hundred feet of Cretaceous strata. This is not mere 
conjecture, nor an inference drawn from having seen this formation under cir-

cumstances leading us to suppose from the dip of the strata, that it must pass 
beneath the Cretaceous if continued in a given direction at the same angle of 
inclination, but from the fact that it has actually been seen, directly beneath 
the other Cretaceous rocks, not merely at one place, and by one observer, but 
by several persons at numerous localities. 
In order to satisfy others we are not mistaken in this, we will give a few of 
the many facts in our possession, bearing on this question. In the first place, 
we would remark that the farthest point towards the south at which we have 
seen this formation, is near Smoky Hill river, in Kansas, latitude 38*^ 30' north, 
and longitude 97Â° 30' west. Here we found it forming the upper part of sev- 
etal isolated elevations known as the " Smoky Hills," at an altitude of about 
1200 feet above the Missouri at Fort Leavenworth. At this locality, however, we 
saw no rocks overlying it, and consequently have no stratigraphical evidence 
that it is the same rock seen by us at other localities under Cretaceous beds ; 
but our lithological and palaeontological evidence is quite conclusive on this 
point, for this rock in color, composition, and all other respects, is undistin- 
guishable from No. 1, of the Nebraska section, as seen near the mouth of Big 
Sioux river on the Missouri, and contains numerous fossil leaves, some of which 
are identical with those occurring in No. 1, at the last mentioned localities. 
Amongst these leaves Dr. Newberry has also identified at least one genus 
(^Ettingshausiania) peculiar to the Cretaceous system. 
Bearing in mind that all the rocks here have a gentle but uniform inclination 
or dip to the north west ; and that the formation under consideration consists 
of red and yellowish sandstones, and various colored clays, with generally more 
or less impure lignite and ferruginous concretions, we will be prepared to recog- 
nize it at lower and lower elevations as we proceed northward. 
Without undertaking to mention in detail the intermediate exposures, we will- 
pass northward at once to localities where it has been seen beneath Cretaceous 
rocks by three different observers at various times ; this is near the Kansas and 
Nebraska line â latitude 40Â° north, and in the vicinity of 97*=> of west longitude. 
Here at an elevation of about seven hundred feet above the Missouri at Fort 
Leavenworth, or some five hundred feet below the level of the exposures 
mentioned at the Smoky Hills, our deceased friend, Mr. Henry Pratten, saw 
near Wyeth's creek, in 1853, the following exposures in descending order ; 
1st. Slope, thickness not given. 
2nd. Yellow and whitish limestone filled with casts 
of Inoceramus^ referred by him to /. myteloides >No. 3, Nebraska Sec. 
= /. problematicus . J 
3rd. Slope, thickness not given. | No. 2, Nebraska Sec. 
4th. Red ferruginous sandstone with leaves of di- 5 -kt i qââ

cotyledonous trees. 5 
A short distance west of this exposure Dr. J. G. Cooper informs us he saw 
outcrops of a red sandstone in the valleys at about the same elevation ; and 
above this, exposures of dark gray laminated clay answering exactly the de- 
scription of No. 2, of the Nebraska section, while above the latter, near the tops 
of the hills, he met with outcrops of light colored limestone containing numer- 
ous casts of Inoceramus. 
At other localities not far to the southwest of the foregoing, Mr. Hawn saw ex- 
posures of light colored limestone forty-five feet in thickness, containing great 
numbers of Inoceramus which we referred, from specimens sent by him, to /. 
problematicus. * Below this there was a slope of twenty-seven feet in which 
he saw no exposures, while still lower he observed outcrops of dark ferrugi- 
nous and yellow sandstone, and various colored clays with impressions of leaves 
* It is with some donbt we have referred this species to I. problematicus ; it is the same spe- 
cies described by Dr. Schiel in the second volume of the Pacific Rail Road Report, pyge 108, plate 
3, figure 8. It is rather longer on the hinge than is common in I. problematicue, from which it 
may be distinct. We always refer to this shell in speaking of /. problematicus.

resembling, as he supposed, those of oaks and willows. (See his section pub- 
lished by us in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila- 
delphia, May, 1857.) 
Proceeding northward from the last mentioned localities, we find on reaching 
the Loup fork of Platte river, near the eastern limits of the Pawnee reservation, 
outcrops of the light colored Inoceramus beds already mentioned, (No. 3, Ne- 
braska section,) near the water's edge ; and at the mouth of Loup fork, on the 
Platte, the red sandstone No. 1, so often referred to, crops out near the river 
margin, v/hile the Lioceramus beds are seen in the bluffs above it. Going down 
the Platte in a direction nearly contrary to the dip of the strata, we find this 
sandstone rising up so as to form near the mouth of Elk Horn river, bluffs some 
sixty feet in height. Here it seems to rest directly upon Carboniferous rocks. 
Continuing on down the Platte, we find this red and yellow sandstone rising 
higher and higher in the hills until we come within five or six miles of the 
Missouri, where it is seen with its base elevated near sixty feet above the Platte; 
and there are probably outlines of it between that point and the Missouri at 
greater elevations. So that we here find the same formation which at Smoky 
Hill river is elevated about twelve hundred feet above the level of the Missouri 
at Fort Leavenworth, and seven hundred feet above the same horizon near Little 
Blue river, has by the gradual north-western dip of the strata, sunk to within 
about one hundred feet of the Missouri at the mouth of the Platte.* 
Ascending the Missouri from the localities just mentioned, we see occasional 
exposures of the upper Carboniferous rocks, which gradually sink lower and lower 
until they pass beneath the river near Florence, to be succeeded by the reddish 
and yellow sandstones, &c., of No. 1, â (Nebraska section.) Above this, occa- 
sional exposures of this formation are seen with its characteristic fossil leaves, 
â¢along the river; and at several localities, some thirty miles below the mouth of 
Big Sioux river, it forms perpendicular escarpments of yellowish sandstone 
rising from the water's edge to an elevation of about eighty feet ; while at a 
higher point, back on the summits of the Hills, the same calcareous beds are 
seen, containing Inoceramus problematicus. Here at a quarry in the sandstone 
(formation No. 1,) some twenty feet above the level of the river, one of us (Dr. 
H.) collected a large number of fossil leaves, some of which are identical with 
species found by us in this rock at the Smoky Hill locality already mentioned. 
The sketches of leaves sent by us to Professor Heer were mostly drawn from 
specimens collected at this locality. 
At the mouth of Big Sioux river a low bluff of this formation, not more 
than fifteen or twenty feet in height, is seen, and on the hills back a little from 
the river at a higher elevation the same Inoceramus bed crops out at several 
places, and is used for making lime. At another locality, about eight or ten 
miles up the Big Sioux river, which comes in from the north west, one of us 
(Dr. H.) saw No. 1, containing its characteristic fossil leaves, directly beneath 
No. 2, of the Nebraska section. This exposure presented the following beds in 
the descending order: 
1st. 20 feet exposed of light gray limestone and marl, ) No. 3 of 
containing Inoceramus Problematicus. ) Nebraska Sec. 
2d, 45 feet dark laminated clay with ferruginous ) No. 2 of 
concretions containing fish scales / Nebraska Sec. 
3d. 15 feet exposed above the edge of the water, con- '\ 
sisting of yellowish friable sandstone, with a | No. 1 of 
thin bed of impure lignite above, and some y Nebraska 
layers of various colored clay below, contain- j Section, 
ing dicotyledonous leaves. J 
* The gradual descent of the Missouri river makes its surface at Fort Leavenworth, about three 
hundred feet lower than at the mouth of the Platte, hence the exposures of No. 1, seen at the lat- 
ter locality, one hundred feet above the Missouri, are some four hundred feet above the level of 
the Missouri at Fort Leavenworth, and of course about three hundred feet lower than the Little 
Blue river outcrops. The dip, however, is greater than this would indicate, for the strata incline 
towards the north west, while the mouth of Platte river, is north east of the Blue river localities.

Oae of the sketches of a long lanceolate leaf, like some of the existing species 
of Salix, sent by us to Prof. Heer, was drawn from a specimen collected, from 
one of the lower sandstones here. 
Aejain at another locality on the Missouri, about thirty miles above the mouth 
of Big Sioux river, No. 1, was seen by one of us (Dr. 11.) only five feet above 
the water's edge, and immediately overlaid by No. 2, of the Nebraska section, con- 
taining its characteristic species of Ammonites ; and directly over the latter, he 
saw No. 3, containing Inoceramus Prohlematicus. * At this locality he also 
found in No. 1 some of the same fossil leaves characterizing it at the other 
places already mentioned. 
On ascending the Missouri, above the last named locality, formations No. 2, 
3, 4 and 5 are seen to sink at the same gradual uniform rate of dip, in regular 
succession, beneath the level of the Missouri ; so that on reaching Heart river, 
we find the top of No. 5 nearly down on a level with the water's edge, and a 
short distance above that locality it passes out of sight, to be succeeded by the 
Gceat Tertiary Lignite basin of the upper Missouri, which overlaps it on the 
hills along the river for some distance below. 
From the foregoing statement, we think it will be clearly understood, that 
formation No. 1 of the Nebraska section holds a position beneath the other 
cretaceous deposits of that region ; while the occurrence in it of highly organiz- 
ed angiosperm dicotyledonous plants proves that it cannot be older than Cre- 
taceous. It may be argued, however, that it may in part be Cretaceous and 
part Tertiary, or at any rate that some of these leaves may have been obtained 
from overlying Tertiary beds which we have confounded with the Cretaceous 
below. This, however, is impossible, simply because specimens of nearly all the 
species found at the varions localities, have been quarried from the same bed at 
Blackbird Hill, and the whole, not a part only of this formation, passes beneath 
all the other Cretaceous rocks of the north west. In addition to this, we hare 
extensive collections of plants from the Tertiary of Nebraska, not a single species 
of which is identical with those from No. 1. 
When we stated in some of our papers that it was possible we might have 
included in this formation beds not belonging to the Cretaceous, it was not be- 
cause we thought any part of it might be Tertiary, but because we suspected 
some of the lower beds referred to it in Kansas might possibly be Jurassic ; and 
we are even now prepared to believe it may yet be found to repose on Jurassic 
rocks in that Territory, as it does at the Black Hills. 
Descriptions op new Carboniferous Fossils. 
The carboniferous species described in the following pages of this paper, were 
collected by us in Kansas, from the upper coal measures, extending up to the 
base of the Permian, through a series of strata holding a higher stratigraphical 
position than most of the coal deposits of the west. We found this series of 
rocks abounding, at places, in organic remains, mostly of the same species oc- 
curring in the coal measures of Missouri, along with a few others approxima- 
ting to Permian forms. 
Amongst our collections from these rocks we have identified most of the car- 
boniferous species figured by Prof. Marcou in his work on the geology of North 
America, which represents a group of fossils characteristic of our western coal 
measures. We had hoped to have ready for this paper some remarks on ihe 
upper carboniferous and Permian rocks of Kansas, illustrated by many local 
sections, showing the range of the various fossils, but we have, for want of time, 
been compelled to defer these for another occasion. 
Fdsulina cylindrica, Fischer. 
In our collections from the upper members of the Coal Measures of Kansas, we 
have great numbers of FusuUna, many of which agree so very nearly with figures 
* It is of course unnecessary for us to inform geological readers that a rock overlaid by strata 
containing Ammonites and Inoceramus^ cannot be Tertiary, because these genera became extinct 
at the dawn of the Tertiary epoch.

and descriptions of the species above cited, that we have thus far failed to find 
any reliable diflFerences by which they can be distinguished. If these are really- 
identical with F. cylindrica it not only proves that species to have had an im- 
mense geographical range, but to have existed through vast periods of time, 
since, according to Murchison de Verneuil andKeyserling, it is widely distribu- 
ted in Russia, where it only occurs in the upper part of the lower carboniferous 
or mountain limestone series; while in Kansas it ranges through a great thick- 
ness of upper carboniferous rocks, much of which appears to be even more 
modern than most of the western coal measures. 
F. cylindrica var. ventricosa. 
Along with the forms above mentioned, which we regard as probably identical 
with Fasulina cylindrica, we find in some of the upper members of the coal mea- 
sures in Kansas, others differing so much in size and form, that we even suspect 
they may possibly belong to a distinct species. These we propose to designate 
for the present as a variety of F. cylindrica^ under the name of ventricosa^ which 
will be a good specific name, should they prove to be distinct. They differ 
from F. cylindrica^ as figured in Murchison de Verneuil and Keyserling's work 
on the geology of Russia, in being much larger, some of them measuring nearly 
half an inch in length, and 0.20 inch in diameter at the middle ; they are also 
proportionably much more ventricose, and differ in being usually less symme- 
trical, in consequence of ane side being more gibbous than the other. The 
transverse grooves marking the position of the septa also pass across the central 
ventricose region with more of a lateral curve than in the Russian specimens ; 
while the edges of the septa themselves, when the outer shell is removed, are 
seen to be apparently less distinctly waved. Again the aperture in all our 
specimens is so very narrow as to appear entirely closed. 
In the description of the Russian specimens it is said that young individuals 
are proportionably so much shorter and more fusiform than the old, that they 
might readily be mistaken for a different species ; exactly the reverse, however, is 
the case with our Kansas specimens, the smaller individuals being more nearly 
cylindrical, while they appear to have become more gibbous with age, until in 
some cases they might be described as subglobose.

Shell rather large, semicircular, having its greatest breadth on the cardinal 
border, which is usually extended into mucronate angles. Surface ornamented 
by a few sub-imbricating concentric marks of growth, crossed by fine regular 
closely set strise, about one hundred and fifty of which may be counted around 
the border, where eight or nine of them occupy the space of one line. 
Larger valve depressed, having generally a broad, shallow, undefined, mesial 
sinus extending from the front towards the beak. Ears sometimes separated from 
the central region by very shallow depressions, and often slightly curved upwards 
at the extremities. Cardinal margin sloping a little from the beaks, on each 
side of which it is ornamented by from eight to eleven tubular spines, directed 
Â©bliquely outwards. Area rather wide and, having a broad deltoid aperture, 
with elevated margins. 
Smaller valve following nearly the curve of the other ; beak and central re- 
gion concave ; ears flat ; area rather broad, but narrower than the other, and 
rectilinear. Interior provided with a small very slightly projecting bifid median 
tooth, which nearly closes the aperture of the other valve. From the base of 
this tooth there are five radiating ridges, two of which are rather obscure, and 
extend obliquely outwards near the cardinal edge, while a third extends at right 
angles to the hinge, a little more than half way across towards the front of the 
yalve. The other two ridges are much shorter, and occupy an intermediate po- 
sition between this median ridge and the lateral one, and are directed oblique- 
ly forwards and outwards. The whole interior is more or less granulose, the 
granules near the border being much smaller than the others, and ranged in rows 
parallel to the strias on the outside. Breadth of largest specimen 1.13 in.; length 
0-62 inch. 
This species is very nearly allied to C. Smithn, of Norwood and Pratten, to 
which we we were at first inclined to refer it ; a careful examination, however, 
of a large number of individuals in all conditions of preservation, has satisfied 
us that the striae of the shell now before us are always entirely destitute of the 
pits so characteristic of C. Smithn. Our shell is also much more extended on 
the hinge line, which terminates in more acute angles ; while there are not un- 
frequently eleven, instead of ten tubes on each side of the beak. 
Locality and position, â Near Fort Riley, K. T., Upper Coal Measures. 
AxiNus (ScHizoDus) ovATUs, h. sp. 
Shell ovate, most gibbous slightly in advance of the middle; anterior extrem- 
ity broader than the other, somewhat narrowly rounded; posterior end narrow 
and compressed, obliquely truncate above, sub-angular below. Base semiovate 
in outline, the most prominent part being in advance of the middle; cardinal 
edge very short, straight and horizontal, meeting the obliquely truncate poste- 
rior margin at an angle of about one hundred and thirty degrees. Beaks loca- 
ted slightly in advance of the middle, elevated, and incurved at right angles to 
the hinge, rather distinctly angular down the posterior slopes and obliquely 
towards the lower part of the posterior extremity. Surface unknown. Length 
0-65 inch ; heighth 0-45 inch ; transverse diameter of the two valves 0-20 inch. 
This species appears to be about intermediate between Schizodus truncatus^ 
King, and S. rotundatus, Brown, as represented by figures 27 and 30, plate xv., 
King's Permian fossils of England. From S. rotundatus, it differs in being more 
elongate, less broadly rounded in front, and much more obliquely truncate pos- 
teriorly ; the hinge line is also shorter and more nearly horizontal. It differs 
from ;S'. truncaius in the more nearly central position of the beaks, much shorter 
and less sloping cardinal edge ; while its anterior extremity is more narrowly 
rounded.

AlLORISMA ? ALTIROSTRATA, D. Sp. 
Shell oblong oval, very gibbous in the umbonal region ; beaks much elevated 
above the cardinal edge, incurved, and located over the anterior end. Posterior 
extremity more compressed, but apparently more or less gaping, rounded in out- 
line, anterior end vertically subtruncate, somewhat gaping ; base nearly straight, 
or a little concave near the middle, rounding up towards the extremities. Car- 
dinal border rather short, straight and inflected so as to form a moderately dis- 
tinct, impressed area for the reception of the ligament. Surface of cast marked 
by concentric undulations, which are narrower, more regular, and distinct on 
the umbones and over their slopes, than towards the base and extremities. 
From the anterior side of the beaks, there is on each valve, an obscure sulcus 
descendiug obliquely and widening towards the middle of thebase. Length 3-06 
inch ; height from the base to dorsal margin 1-63 inch ; do. to highest part of 
beaks 1"74 inch ; greatest transverse diameter. 
Having ooly seen an internal cast of this shell, showing neither the muscular 
norpallial impressions, and giving no clue to the character of the hinge, there 
must remain some uncertainty respecting its generic relauons. Its most marked 
peculiarity is the unusual elevation of the beaks, which gives it much the form 
of some of the Jurassic Pholadomyas. We know of no other shell from the whole 
Carboniferous System with which it can be confounded. 
Locality and position. â Grasshopper Creek, K. T., Upper Coal Measures. 
Allorisma subcuneata, n. sp. 
Shell large, clavate, cuneate, gibbous in the anterior and umbonal regions, 
contracted and compressed posteriorly. Beaks depressed, incurved and re- 
moved about one eighth the length of the shell from its apterior extremity. Pos- 
terior end narrowly rounded, and apparently gaping a little; buccal end olb- 
liquely truncate above, rather narrowly rounded, and somewhat gaping below. 
Base nearly straight along the middle, curving up very gradually behind, and 
abruptly in front ; dorsal outline sloping slightly from the beaks towards the 
anal extremity. Surface of cast marked by more or less regular concentric un- 
dulations; hinge long and straight; lunule oval, not very well defined ; ligament 
area long and narrow, bounded on either side by a narrow obscure ridge, on the 
outside of which there is a long, parallel, shallow undefined sulcus. Anterior 
muscular impression lunate, the upper extremity curved back over itself so as to 
give the whole somewhat the form of the letter G ; posterior muscular impres- 
sion, large, oval, ovate, or rhomboidal, located about one third the length of the 
shell from the posterior end ; pallial impression faint, having a deep angular si- 
nus. Length 5-10 inch ; height 2-25 inch ; greatest thickness near the anterior 
end 1-70 inch. 
This species is very similar to Sanguinolites clava of MeCoy, but its ventral 
margin is straighter, its beaks rather more depressed, and its anterior border 
more narrowly rounded below the beaks. The lunette on the anterior side of 
the beaks, in our shell, appears to be less distinctly defined than is represented 
in Prof. McCoy's figure, while the anterior muscular impression m S. clava ap- 
pears to be orbicular instead of lunate as in our shell. 
Locality and position. â Leavenworth City, in upper coal measures, 
Allorisma? Leavenworthensis, n. sp. 
Shell very thin, oblong, subcylindrical behind, more compressed anteriorly; 
posterior end broad, rather obliquely truncate, very widely gaping, or even di- 
lated at the margins ; buccal end narrowly rounded and nearly closed. Base 
almost straight, or but slightly convex, rounding up gradually in front and much 
more abruptly unto the truncate posterior border. Dorsal outline concave from 
the beaks to its elevated posterior extremity. Beaks moderately elevated, slight- 
ly flattened," more or less angular behind, incurved, and located about half way 
between the middle and the anterior end. Surface marked by obscure concen-

trie undulations, which curve abruptly upwards parallel to the truncate anal 
margin; these undulations are crossed by radiating rows of very small granules, 
only visible by the aid of a lens. 
The anterior muscular impression is oval, arcuate, and surmounted by a small 
accessory impression nearly detached from it. The posterior muscular impres- 
sion is broad oval, not very deep, and placed close up under the posterior ex- 
tremity of the dorsal edge ; from this impression, the pallial line descends, with 
a broad gently concave curve, so as to form a broad very shallow sinus. 
Length 2-85 inches ; height from ventral margin to middle of dorsal edge 1'3G 
inch ; do. from ventral margin to a line drawn from summit of beaks to the 
elevated posterior extremity 1-50 inch; greatest transverse diameter (near the 
centre) 1-11 inch; breadih of posterior hiatus 1-07 inch, height do 1-44 
inch. ^

March 2d, 1858. 
This species bears such a striking similarity, in form and general aj^pear- 
ance, to some of the Jurassic and Cretaceous Panopseas, that we were at first 
lead to refer it to that genus, supposing as we then did, that it was a Permian 
species. Since that time we have collected specimens of it in Kansas, show- 
ing that the hinge is edentulous, consequently it cannot be a Panopcea ; we 
therefore now refer it provisionally to the genera Allorisma, King, to which it 
appears most nearly related, though we are not quite sure it is a true Allorisma. 
We found it ranging^ through a considerable thickness of the upper coal 
measures, but we do not think it ranges quite up into the Permian. 
Locality and position. â Near Helena, Kansas Territory, Upper Coal Measures. 
Pleurotomaria subturbinata, n. sp. 
Shell rather thick, obliquely conical ; spire moderately elevated, pointed at 
the apex ; volutions six to six and a half, convex and angular in the middle, 
obliquely concave above, and having around the middle of the last one, just 
below the angle, a rather narrow revolving shallow sulcus. Umbilical region 
not much depressed, but perforated by a very small pit ; aperture suborbicular. 
Surface ornamented by small revolving lines, only preserved on the under and 
outer sides of the body whorl in our specimen, which is somewhat worn, and 
shows no lines of growth. The angle on the middle of the whorls appears to 
he double, or composed of two closely set parallel lines ; suture linear but 
distinct. 
Length 0'36 inch ; breadth 0*29 inch ; spiral angle regular, divergence 69*. 
Locality and position. â Same as last. 
Pleurotomaria humerosa, n. sp. 
Shell ovate turbinate ; spire turreted, moderately elevated and pointed at 
the apes. Volutions five to five and a half, very convex, more or less ob- 
liquely flattened or a little concave above, rounded below, and distinctly an- 
gular at the outer margin of the upper flattened side. Suture distinct ; um- 
bilical region slightly depressed, and having a very small perforation. Surface 
ornamented by about ten rather strong revolving lines, only four of which are 
visible on the turns of the spire, below the angle ; on the obliquely flattened 
space above, there are usually six or seven revolving striae, which are not more 
than half as large as those below the angle. Aperture suborbicular. No lines 
of growth are visible on our specimens, which are somewhat worn. 
Length 0*62 inch ; breadth 0-50 inch, spiral angle about 62Â°.

The following are the descriptions by Prof. Heer of the fossil plants from. 
No. 1 of the Nebraska section, referred to on page 257. 
1. Liriodendron MeeJcii, Mihi. 
L. foliis trilolbatis, lobo medio apice rotundato, late emarginato, basi angus- 
tato, lobis lateralibus obtusis. 
Differt a L. Procaccinii, Unger, et a L. tuUpifera, L., lobis rotundatis et lobo 
medio basi angustato. 
This leaf is furnished with a slender petiole, towards which it gradually 
diminishes ; the midrib extends to the apex ; towards the middle of the lobes 
on each side proceeds a secondary nerve, which also sends out on both sides 
tertiary nerves at rather acute angles. Further down on each side (near the 
base) is another secondary nerve, which inosculates with the former. This is 
a mode of structure which characterizes Liriodendron ; further up there arises 
very delicate secondary nerves, which likewise branch oS from the petiole. 
2. Sapotacites Haydenii, Mihi. 
S. foliis obcordato-ellipticis, basi sensim attenuatis integerrimis penninervis, 
nervis secondariis numerosis, ramosis angulo-acuto egredientibus. 
Affinis S. mimusops, Heer. Flora Tert. Helv. I. Taf. ciii. f. 4. 
The leaf gradually diminishes toward the base, rounded toward the apex, 
rather deeply emarginate, margins entire. From the midrib which gradually 
becomes slender and dies out, proceed at acute angles very numerous secon- 
dary nerves which have the peculiarity of ramifying very much, 
3. Lauriis primagenia, Unger. Taf. 13, fig. 1 ? 
Heer, Flora tertiar Helvet. Taf. Ixxxvi. fig. 1. 
Tlie form and nervation agree as far as the leaf has been preserved, with 
the preceding species, only the leaf is diminished in a somewhat less degree 
toward the petiole, and prolonged toward the apex as in Unger. 
It looks quite similar to the leaves of Laurus primagenia, which I have re- 
ceived from Corfe, in the Isle of Wight. 
Dunker (Paleontographica, iv. Taf. 34, f. 2,) has figured a similar leaf as 
Salicites Hartigi, from the chalk of Blankenburg. But in this, along with 
stouter secondary nerves, there are always several more delicate ones. 
4. Legiiminosites Marcouanus, Mihi. 
L. foliis magnis, obovalibus, apice obtusis, emarginatis nervis secondariis 
sparsis ; basilaribus approximatis. 
The leaflet is very large, but ceasalpinia-like, at the base somewhat un- 
equal, obtusely rounded. It is also rounded at the apex and deeply emar- 
ginate. The midrib dies out toward the apex ; secondary nerves very sparse 
and delicate, one on each side near the base, the next following ones distant 
and much curved. 
In its form it reminds one strongly of Ccesalpinia Falconeri, but is much 
larger. It would, however, be important to know whether the leaf is leather- 
like or thin skinned. If the latter is the case, the leaf probably belongs to 
Csesalpinia, but if it is leather-like, the Dalbergia are to be compared, as 
among them similarly shaped leaves are found. 
5. Populus leuce, Unger. Taf. 15, fig. 6 ? 
Phyllites leuce, Eossmassler, Blatter Von Altsaltel, Taf. 3, fig. 12 ? 
Unfortunately this leaf is not preserved entire, and the margin is no where 
complete. So far, however, as the form can be determined, it agrees with 
Populus leuce, as also in the nervation. Thus we have a stout midrib, and from 
this mid rib above the base of the leaf proceeds on either side stout secondary 
nerves, which then send off outwardly two or three rather stout tertiary 
nerves, which are curved toward the apex. Besides these, springs forth on 
each side below them, but almost at the same spot, a delicate secondary nerve 
which does not ramify any further, but dies out near the margin. At about 
the middle of the height of the leaf, there springs from the midrib on each 
1858.]

PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 
side, another secondary nerve, wliich runs nearly parallel with the basal one, 
and further above are two other similar ones. The nervules are curved, soms 
remaining single, others forked. In all these points the Nebraska leaf agreee 
with Populus leuce, but for a positive determination we must wait for leaves 
whose margins have been preserved. 
A similar leaf from the Isle of Wight has been figured by Prestwieh (on the 
structure of the strata between the London clays, &c., Quart. Jour. x. pi. iv. 
fig. 1, 2), but in this (of which I have specimens before me) the lower basal 
nerves are much stouter, and the two upper ones are curved much more 
toward the apex, while the midrib cannot send forth any more sach stout 
secondary nerves farther up. 
At first sight the leaf also appears similar to Credneria integerrima Zenker, 
Paleontographica, but in this leaf the midrib is much stouter, and the side 
nerves are more bent and curved towards the apex, otherwise the nervules are 
of similar structures. 
6. Populus cyclophylla, Mihi. 
P. foliis orbiculatis, basi attenuatis, triplinervis, integerrimis. 
Similar to the preceding, and may perhaps belong to that species as a 
younger leaf, yet the base of the leaf is attenuated toward the petiole, and 
there are at the base of the leaf only three nerves. On the supposition that 
the former leaf is Populus leuce it is assumed that it is rounded at the base, 
but should more perfectly preserved specimens show that, like the small one, 
it is diminished at the base into the petiole, it would form a species different 
from Populus leuce, as in this latter species the leaves are rounded at the base, 
and moreover possess some obtuse teeth on the margin. 
7. PJujllites obtusi-lobatus, Mihi. 
Folium trilobatum, lobis integerrimis, obtusiusculis. 
Perhaps belonging to Liriodendron Meekii, but Liquidambar and Acer are 
also to be taken into consideration. It is, however, too imperfectly preserved to 
be determined with certainty. It seems to have three lobes with entire margins. 
8. PhijUites obcordatus, Mihi. 
Polium obcordatum, basi angustatum, integerrimum, nervo-primario po- 
necto, nervis secondariis angulo acuto, egredientibus, debilibus, subramosis. 
Valde affinis Ph. clusiodes, Rossmassler, Beitrage 33, Taf. 6, fig. 24, et non 
nisi nervis secundariis fortioribus et ramulosis distingusenim.

Of the above works 76 have been contributed by authors, 84 by editors, 51 
by members, correspondents and others, 351 by societies and corporations, 
and 996 by Dr. T. B. Wilson, making a total of 1768 additions to the Library 
in 1858. 
During the year 962 volumes have been substantially bound ; 365 are still 
in the hands of the binders, making in all 1327 volumes. 
It will thus be seen that the Library was never in a more flourishing con- 
dition, nor in a better state of preservation than at the present time.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
REPORT OF THE CURATORS FOR 1858. 
The Curators, through their annual report, take the opportunity of express- 
ing their pleasure in announcing to the Academy, that the Museum, so long 
confided to the supervision and care of the same gentlemen, is in the best 
state of preservation, and is gradually and steadily advancing in its arrange- 
ment. They also take occasion to express regret at the resignation of one of 
their number, Mr. Ashmead, who has for seventeen years devoted attention to 
the increase and preservation of the collections of the Academy. 
In most of the departments of the Museum, for some years past, members 
have been actively engaged in the arrangement and labelling of specimens, 
but up to the present time, two important collections, those of recent Radiates 
and Invertebrate Fossils, have been entirely neglected. The collection of Fos- 
sils, just mentioned, is a very large and important one, but loses much of its 
value from the difficulty of applying to it in its present condition. We hope, 
before long, some of the members may be induced to give it the attention that 
has been devoted to other departments. 
During the past year Mr. Slack has given his aid in the labelling of the col- 
lection of Mammalia. Our collection of Birds, which has few parallels in the 
world, is in excellent condition, and is steadily advancing in its arrangement 
through Dr. Wilson ; who has also further enriched it, during the last year, 
with many rare specimens. The collection of Reptiles, well arranged and la- 
belled by Dr. Hallowell, has unfortunately lost the services of the latter, tem- 
porarily it is to be hoped, from illness, as many of the members are aware. 
The collection of Fishes continues to be|arranged by Drs. Bridges and Morris. 
Mr. Binney, who has been engaged for several years in arranging the collec- 
tion of Mollusks, has given us the following information. 
The collection of shells consists of about 9,000 species of many varieties. 
About one half are labelled. All the terrestrial and fluviatile species have been 
carefully studied ; and the names attached to them may be depended upon. 
The marine genera have been labelled from monographs, and through the as- 
sistance of friends familiar with them. A large part of them have the names 
attached by Sowerby, Cuming, and Verreaux, from whom they were purchased. 
In the arrangement of the collection. Jay's catalogue has been used, and the 
author's system followed. The Gasteropods commence in the western part of 
the hall : the Tropiopods in the eastern part ; and the labels are on cards adopt- 
ed in the other departments of the Museum â distinguishing the principal 
parts of the world by colors. A large portion of the Conchological collection is 
contained in the drawers beneath the cases in which the others are exposed to 
view. The Academy is indebted to Mr. J. G. Anthony, of Cincinnati, for the 
determination and labelling of the Naiades. The principal contributors to the 
cabinet of conchology have been Messrs. Say, Griffith, and Wilson. 
The collection contains many of the types of American authors, as follow : 
2 species Anculosa, Anthony; 4 Amnicola, Say, Anth., Lea ; 2 AmpuUaria Say ; 
2 Amphidesma Say ; 1 Astarte Say ; 1 Achatina Say ; 1 Cochlodesma Conrad ; 1 
Corbula Say ; 5 Cyclas Say ; 1 Crepidula Say ; 2 Cylindrella Gould ; 1 Cerithium 
Say ; 1 Donax Say ; 1 Dentalium Stimpson ; 2 Helicina Say ; 14 Helix Say, 6 
Binney, 4 Gould, 1 Green, 1 Lea ; 17 Limnea Say, 1 Adams ; 1 Mya Conrad ; 
1 Mactra Say, 1 Con. ; 1 Merodesma Con. ; 1 Modiola Say ; 1 Mytilus Say ; 8 
Melanin Say , 8 Con., 4 Anth., 2 Ravenel, 1 Lea ; 1 Melampus Say ; 1 Natica 
Couthouy ; 1 Nassa Say ; 2 Nucida Couth. ; 1 Patella Say ; 2 Physa Say ; 4 
Flanorhis Say ; 1 Porena Say ; 3 Papa Say ; 8 Paludina Say, 2 Lewis, 1 Con. ; 
1 Pandora Say ; 1 Sigaretus Say ; 2 Succinea Say, 2 Binney, 1 Gould ; 1 Sole- 
curtus Con. ; 2 Sanguinolaria Con., Say ; 1 Saxicava Say ; 2 Turbo Say, Couth. ; 
8 Unio Say, 1 Lea ; 2 Valvata Say. 
Mr. Durand informs us that the North American Herbarium of Phaenoga- 
mous plants and ferns, containing about 10,000 species, is now completed. 
The donations to the different departments of the Museum for 1858, are as

Observations on the Blood Crystals of the Sturgeon. 
BY S. WEIR MITCHELL, M. D. 
While studying the blood of the sturgeon some time ago, I observed certain 
facts of interest in regard to the crystallization of the albuminoid contents of 
the blood corpuscles. In man, it is difficult to obtain blood crystals, and in 
some cases I have totally failed to form them from his blood. In the sturgeon, 
ihe tendency on the part of the blood to undergo this change is so great that it 
is difficult to check the formation of crystals where their presence is undesira- 
ble. Two methods of procuring the crystals may be employed : 
1st. A drop of fresh blood is placed on a slide, and allowed to evaporate to 
one half of its bulk. An equal quantity of distilled water is next added, and an 
over glass superimposed. The crystals sometimes appear in a few minutes, 
but more often they are first seen within periods varying from one hour to 
ten. Once begun, the process continues slowly for some time. 
2d. A readier mode, where time is not an object, is to allow the whole mass 
of blood to stand in an open vessel exposed to light, and to a temperature of 
*iOÂ° or 70Â° F. Decomposition occurs slowly. The clot dissolves within a week, 
and the mass of blood becomes dark and very fluid. When evaporation is 
allowed to take place for a length of time, the blood becomes very ofl'ensive, 
and of a tar-like consistency. 
At any time after forty-eight hours, a drop of this blood will yield by slight 
evaporation, without added water, the most beautiful crystals. After this period, 
the. crystals form abundantly in the mass of blood, and may be easily examined. 
The crystals formed in the two ways just described are essentially alike, but, 
as other crystals of a different character occur with them, it is necessary to 
describe all the forms which present themselves. 
The first crystals which form, in whatever mode the blood be treated, are of 
[April;

two kinds, neither of which are of albuminous nature. On plate 1, fig. 1, are 
drawn certain short abruptly acuminated crystals of a pyramidal form. These 
occur early, and are colorless, or nearly so. They strongly refract light, and are 
soluble in excess of ether, and in liq. potassae, and insoluble in water. They 
disappear from the decomposing blood within two or three days after their for- 
mation. They are probably of a fatty character. We also observe in the blood 
very beautiful groups of long, shining, colorless needles, and slender, double 
pyramids. See pi. 7, fig. 2. These also appear before the true albuminoid crys- 
tals are seen ; the addition of a little water readily dissolves them. They are 
undoubtedly of a saline character. 
The 3rd set of crystals in order of formation are the true albuminoid crystals. 
These magnificent microscopic objects present themselves in the sturgeon blood 
either as hexagonal columns, or as sections of these, constituting hexagonal 
tablets of the utmost beauty, pi. 2, 3, and 7. Granting these crystals to be of 
albuminoid character, as Lehmann, Franke, and others have clearly made out 
there are some additional points of sufficient interest to deserve remark. 
The mechanical behaviour of the crystals adds to the proofs of their animal 
character. Thus in place of being dissolved by certain re-agents, they become 
contracted and deformed, but lose no bulk. Again, if the cover glass be pressed 
down upon a large tetrahedron from the Guinea pig's blood, the crystal will 
sometimes break up, but occasionally one will yield to the pressure, and flatten 
out into a disc, resuming its angular form again when the pressure ceases. 
Here then are elastic crystals. 
The persistency with which these delicate albuminoid bodies retain their 
form when left in the putrefying blood is very remarkable. Thus, on the third 
of July I placed some sturgeon blood in a vial. It soon presented an abundance 
of crystals which remained in it quite perfect up to the April following, when I 
threw it away. During this period the blood was utterly putrid, and developed 
foul gases to such an extent as to drive the cork out repeatedly. 
This fact is the more singular, because almost every chemical re-agent acts 
on these crystals destructively, and because I have failed to preserve them as 
microscope specimens after very numerous efforts. 
These columns and hexagons are, I believe, larger than any blood crystals 
hitherto studied. I have formed them of one-eighth to one-twelfth of an inch in 
length. 
One chemist, Lehmann, is of opinion that the red coloring matter of the blood, 
which so adds to the beauty of these crystals, is an essential chemical constitu- 
ent. Against this view it may be urged : first, that the color varies even in 
crystals of equal thickness ; second, that I have often been able to bleach a 
crystal, or at least destroy or wash out its color with alcohol and water, with- 
out injury to its form. Third, that I have been able to re-dissolve the crystals 
in water and obtain them again by careful evaporation, devoid of color, but 
unchanged in crystalline type. My friend Prof. C. Johnston, of Baltimore, has 
obtained a like result with the blood crystals of the opossum. 
The blood crystals of the sturgeon I have found to be the same in form, from 
whatever part of the body obtained. In the spring of 1854, I opened a young 
sturgeon, whose spleen was very large, and absolutely stuffed with blood crys- 
tals, whose form was the same as that of the crystals obtained by artificial 
means. Very frequent examinations of the blood crystals of man have afforded 
me like results for him, and have shown how permanent is the type of crystal- 
line form in his case. The blood of the male, the female, the foetus and placenta ; 
and the blood of many diseases, as dysentery, measles, cholera, typhoid fever, 
yellow fever, pneumonia, etc., gave in every case the same form of blood crystal. 
Prof. Johnston, of Baltimore, informs me as a contrast to this statement, that 
the splenic vein blood of the opossum affords tetrahedral forms, whilst all the 
other blood of this animal yields rhombic crystals. 
The reactions afforded by the blood crystals of the sturgeon are difficult to 
follow, since many agents completely disintegrate or fibrillate them, without

acting as solvents. Others, as liq. soda and liq. potassae dissolve them readily, 
and at the same time so affect their coloring matter as to give rise to a succes- 
sion of tints, usually resulting in some shade of green. 
Hot water acts readily as a solvent ; cold water, in excess, has a like effect 
after some hours. 
Hydrochloric and sulphuric acids dissolve the crystals easily. Nitrate of 
silver merely blackens them. Alcohol contracts, swells, and at last granulates 
them. 
In good glycerine, the crystals lose color, but remain intact as to form for 
many days, so that it may be possible to use this agent as a means of preparing 
them for the microscopic cabinet. 
Otho Franke, who has made numerous researches upon blood crystals, first 
observed the occurrence of crystals within the envelope of the human blood 
corpuscle. I have frequently seen examples of this phenomenon in the large 
corpuscles of the sturgeon. The crystals are as usual hexagonal plates, capable 
of being re-dissolved, so as to give back to view the original outline of the 
corpuscle. In some instances the nucleus is seen through the crystal, or along 
side of it, but I am not sure that it is caught or included within the crystal 
itself, pi. 6. 
The last fact to which I desire to call attention, is, I think, quite novel, and 
certainly very interesting, as illustrative of some points in pathology. When a 
glass slide containing a group of the crystals is kept for some weeks, the crys- 
tals slowly dry, crack in many directions, and by degrees alter in color so as to 
exhibit very beautiful tints, such as yellow, orange, purple, and varied shades 
of green. 
The same phenomenon may also be seen in the nebulous masses of pigment, 
in dried blood which has not crystallized. It is to be presumed that these 
changes of color are due to the slow oxidising influence of the atmosphere. 
They recal very strikingly the alterations of tint undergone by the leaf in 
Autumn, and are best comprehended by a glance at the illustrations which ac- 
company this paper. PI. 2, 3, 4, 5.

Summary of the Transactions of the Philadelphia Biological Society. 
Reported by Henry Hartshoene, M. D., Recording Secretary. 
Jan. 18th, 1858. Dr. Wm. A. Hammond read a paper " On the Injection of 
Urea and other substances into the hlood f^"^ giving an account of several series of 
experiments instituted in order to determine the correctness of Frerich's ex- 
planation of ursemic intoxication, by the conversion of urea into carbonate of 
ammonia, and resulting, among other conclusions, in the opinion, that tMs 
theory fails to be sustained, and tliat the carbonate of ammonia is not, itself, 
more poisonous than urea. 
In the brief discussion wMch. ensued, the fact, mentioned in the paper, of 
the non-appearance of ammonia in the breath after the injection into the blood 
of urea mixed with vesical mucus, was noted, as being contrary to expectation 
based on other facts. Dr. Hammond explained that, in his view, the conver- 
sion of urea into carbonate of ammonia, which occurs in the presence of mucus 
out of the body, will not take place in living blood. 
Dr. S. W. Mitchell remarked that healthy mucus has not been found to 
hasten this decomposition of urea ; but that, out of the body, urea will, with- 
out any ferment, undergo spontaneous conversion. 
Reduction of temperature by depletion. â Dr. S. W. Mitchell mentioned that, 
having occasion, recently, in a case of insanity, to take from a patient a very 
large amount of blood â 189 fluid ouncesâ in a short space of time, he observed

that the temperature of the blood underwent a marked decrease with each de- 
pletion. Being, at the first, 100Â° Fahr., it fell by degrees to 96.2Â°. During 
subsequent convalescence it again gradually rose, being at the time of the last 
examination, 98.7'^. 
Intestinal absorption. â Dr. Joseph Leidy made the following remarks : 
The observation of Goodsir, that the epithelium of the intestine appears 
frequently to be thrown off in laminae, exposing the basement membrane so as 
to absorb directly, has been generally denied by others ; but the true mode of 
shedding the columnar epithelium of the intestine has not yet been demon- 
strated. In examining the intestinal canal of insects, as flies, beetles, grass- 
hoppers, &c., the structure of which, although very delicate, is essentially the 
same as that of the intestine of higher animals, having a columnar epithelium 
upon a basement membrane, and beneath this a muscular tunic â on placing 
the mucous membrane upon the object-glass of a microscope while yet living, 
Dr. Leidy observed that, when a little water was added, endosmose taking 
place, the oldest and thinnest cells received the fluid most rapidly, while these 
were pushed out by the presence of others, thus squeezing the liquid through 
them. It is, therefore, probable that the epithelium is shed cell by cell, the 
oldest cells being crowded out by the new ones forming beneath. This can be 
seen by any one under the microscope in the intestine of the common house- 
fly. The nutritious matter in contact with the epithelial cells passes into them 
by endosmose, and thence through the basement membrane into the subjacent 
vessels. Dr. Leidy has never seen the epithelium stripped off in layers, 
although he has often watched the process in mice, serpents, salamanders, and 
frogs, in all of which the mucous membrane has a similar structure. He has, 
however, very often observed the new cells pushing themselves between the 
old ones, altering their shape, â the round ones being seen at the bottom, and 
the elongated oval or pear-shaped ones above. 
Feb. 1st. Oxaluria. â Dr. J. Cheston Morris remarked that it is only within 
the last 35 years that the occasional occurrence of oxalate of lime in the urine 
has been noticed. At first it was only surmised to exist in this excretion from 
the fact that calculi were often found to consist partly of it. But soon after 
the perfection of the microscope, and its general employment in clinical investi- 
gation, octohedral crystals of various sizes and great brilliancy were observed, 
which were proved by chemical investigation to consist wholly of this salt. 
The discovery of the nature of these crystals would probably have been made 
earlier, had not observers been led astray by the fact that oxalate of lime, when 
precipitated ordinarily from solutions of lime-salts by oxalate of ammonia, is 
amorphous. Lehmann, however, states that when extremely dilute solutions 
are used, and the precipitate is examined with high powers, minute bctohedra 
may be distinguished. It is obvious, however, that in physiological chemistry 
some circumstance must exist, modifying the mode of formation of this most 
insoluble salt, as we find it occurring in quite large and beautiful crystals, as 
in the cells of various plants, and even in the urine of man and other mam- 
malia. This modifying circumstance I take to be the extremely gradual for- 
mation of oxalic acid in the course of the chemical changes constantly taking 
place in all organic fluids. The formation of oxalic acid is always due to the 
partial oxidation of the substance when it is procured, whether in the pro- 
cesses of nature, in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, or in our labora- 
tories by the action of nitric acid on sugar. Probably no other substance has 
undergone so rapid a change of opinion as to its pathological importance. Re- 
garded at first as a sure fore-runner of mulberry calculus, it was supposed to 
depend upon a peculiar diathesis as its cause. Then it was supposed to be due 
to the consumption of vegetables containing oxalates ; a view refuted by the 
utter insolubility of oxalate of lime in any of the fluids of the body, and the 
consequent impossibility of its penetrating the blood-vessels â yet supported by 
Wilson and Donne. It has been found to be increased by the use of carbonated 
liquors and of nitrogenous food ; after epileptic convulsions, in chorea, chronic

bronchitis, typhns fever, spermatorrhoea, and dyspepsia. In these diseases, 
we have either a disturbed respiration or an excessive retrograde tissue- 
metamorphosis ; and to these we must look to discover the cause of the ap- 
pearance of oxalate of lime in the urine. The changes which the substances 
introduced into the animal system undergo, are those of progressive oxida- 
tion ; hence it is easily seen that a diminished supply of oxygen, or an increased 
waste of tissue, would be accompanied by an imperfect oxidation. 
But from being regarded as a pathological constituent of high importance, 
oxalate of lime has now come to be considered an almost normal substance in 
the urine. It may be found in almost any specimen of urine which has been 
allowed to stand until the acid fermentation has occurred. Dr. Grolding Bird 
believes the cause of this to be its deposition from a sort of solution in the 
urine, an opinion in which I cannot concur, as proof is wanting that it is solu- 
ble in any urine. It is well known that urine undergoes an acid fermentation, 
commencing soon after its expulsion from the bladder, and continuing for some 
days, during which uric and oxalic acids are formed ; after a time, however, a 
second fermentation occurs, in which the urea is converted into carbonate of 
ammonia. ' What explanation can we give of the occurrence of these apparent- 
ly opposite phenomena in the same liqjiid under the same circumstances ? The 
ferment which acts in both cases is probably the vesical mucus ; and the sub- 
stance changed must be either this mucus, the coloring matter, or the creatin 
and creatinin, as these are the only other nitrogenized substances present. 
That it cannot be the mucus is proved by filtering the urine, after which it still 
ferments, though more slowly. That it is connected with the presence of 
rreatin may be inferred from the fact that Dr. Miltenberger and I (Med. Ex- 
aminer, 1854) have found crystals of creatin formed by spontaneous evapora- 
tion in microscopic specimens of urine containing oxalate of lime. If we take 
Hg N3 O4 as the composition of creatin, two equivalents of the latter, with 
14 of the oxgen would yield 1 equiv. of uric acid, 1 of urea, 2 of oxalic acid, 
and 8 of water, thus : 
2 ( Cs H. N3 O4 ) 4- 14 0 = Co H4 N4 Og + C2 H4 N2 O2 -f 2C2 O3 8H0. 
I suppose some such reaction as this to take place as long as any creatin re- 
mains in the urine, thus explaining the acid fermentation ; when this has 
(..â¢eased to occur, the urea decomposes into carbonate of ammonia. This will 
also explain the crystallization of the oxalate ; for, as this is a slow process, 
the oxalic acid is very slowly presented to the lime-salts of the urine, thus 
falfiUing the condition given by Lehmann as necessary for the formation of the 
crystals. Prof. Jones, of Georgia, succeeded in obtaining them by endosmose, 
to which he attributes this formation; but this is obviously only another 
method of very gradually presenting the oxalic acid to the lime, the main con- 
dition requisite for their formation. 
Dr. Hammond observed, that he had frequently found oxalate of lime in the 
urine, in his own person and that of others, during health ; large crystals, both 
of the dumb-bell and octohedral forms being presented. Dr. Hammond does 
not credit the existence of an "oxalate of lime disease," nor of a diathesis, 
such as is described by some English pathologists, characterized by excess of 
urea. 
Feb. 15th. Dr. T. G. Richardson read an elaborate paper by Dr. George 
Paton, of Gait, Canada West, upon the Functions of the Spinal Cord, as illus- 
trated by experiments on cold-blooded animals ;* endeavoring to show occasion for 
some modification of the theory of reflex action of Marshall Hall, and for the 
opinion that perception is one of the attributes of the spinal cord, and especially 
of the medulla oblongata. 
Dr. Leidy remarked that the experiments narrated in the paper did not ap- 
pear to him entirely conclusive, as the movements described might be auto-

matic. This was tlie view taken by Dr. Leidy of the results observed by him 
in analogous experiments made several years since, npon frogs, flies, &c. He 
believed that the conveyance of impressions, in insects, for instance, to the 
chain of ventral ganglia, should be expected, without supposing perception to 
produce the apparently voluntary movements. While experimenting at one 
time upon pigeons. Dr. Leidy kept one alive, after the removal of the cere- 
brum, for nearly two months. It spent much of the day in walking up and 
down the room, but never passed through the open door into the room adjoin- 
ing, the dark shade of which appeared to have the eflfect, through the retina, of 
a bar or obstacle. All its motions seemed, to Dr. Leidy, to be automatic and 
unreasoning ; approaching the fire, for example, for warmth, but getting so 
near as to burn itself, having, repeatedly, to be picked out of the ash-pan. 
Acts are often set down as evincing consciousness, which are really automatic, 
such as the darting of a frog at a bright object, or of a fly against a window- 
pane. The same act will be repeated a thousand times in the same way, with- 
out learning by the experiment, it being the mere result of an impression on 
the organs of sense. 
Mr. W. Parker Foulke suggested an enquiry, in regard to the somewhat 
complex and determinate movements of newly-born animals, which could not 
possibly have learned by experience how to perform such acts ; if these were 
automatic, how do they differ from those described in the paper of Dr. Paton ? 
Moreover, in using the term ' ' perceptive act, ' ' does Dr. Paton mean that the 
animal is believed to be conscious of the impression through the spinal cord, 
and to act voluntarily ? 
Dr. Richardson considered that this was his meaning, and urged, that in 
some of the experiments related in the paper, sensibility appeared to be shown 
by the purposive character of the movements made. Thus, when an animal, whose 
brain has been removed, is lightly touched about the neck, and makes a 
special movement to brush off" the irritant, this motion is only one of many 
movements possible to the same muscles, and one of the least frequent or nsitii- 
ral to them. We must, therefore, infer sensibility to account for this deter- 
minate movement, instead of the more simple and uniform contraction, such 
as reflex action produces. 
Dr. H. Hartshorne believed that diff"erent modes or degrees of irritation of 
the same surface might produce variable contractions of muscles, under reflex 
action alone. 
Dr. Leidy confirmed this opinion, by examples, in the- movements of frogs, 
flies, &c, from which the brain had been removed. 
Dr. Richardson : â Do not these examples really show the possession of sensi- 
bility by the cord or ventral ganglia, for which the author of the paper con- 
tends ? 
Dr. H. Hartshorne considered that the statement of the paper, that reflex 
actions are always uniform under impressions upon the same part, is true only 
when the impressions are like in degree, and are conveyed by the same nerve- 
fibres, to the same central ganglia. Thus, the impression of light upon the 
retina, which, by one reflex circuit causes the contraction of the pupil, will, by 
another, induce a more general movement of muscles, or the act of sneezing, or 
the flow of tears. Moreover, a purposive or determinate character in move- 
ments does not remove them from the category of automatic actions. Thus, for 
instance, those called instinctive in lower animals, and others, in the higher, 
designated as sensori-motor by some physiologists, are still reflex, that is, de- 
pendent on an impression from without, acting through a complex nervous ap- 
paratus. Dr. Hartshorne has not, in fact, seen satisfactory evidence of the 
existence of will in any animal except man, â the actions of all the others being 
explicable upon the idea of more or less complex automatism ; and, where the 
subject is so obscure, it is most philosophical to assume only the one idea or 
supposition, which will account for the facts, rather than two, as we must do 
1858.]

when, in such experiments as those alluded to, we suppose consciousness and 
will to exist. 
Dr. S. W. Mitchell observed that many very similar experiments to those 
of Dr. Paton had been performed and recorded by Dr. Dowler, of New Orleans ; 
one of which was more extraordinary than any narrated in Dr. Paton's paper ; 
in which an alligator, whose brain, spinal marrow, and viscera had been re- 
moved, yet exhibited movements apparently as intelligently guided as those 
common to the animal in its natural state. 
Dr. Hammond had seen a rattlesnake, the head of which had been cut off, 
and its skin and viscera removed, yet coil itself up and strike. 
Dr. Hammond then read a paper On the alterations produced by Intermittent 
Fever in the excretion of urine, and on the action of the Disulphate of Quinine :* 
tending to show, so far as one case, carefully observed, can prove, that the ex- 
cretion of uric and phosphoric acids is increased during the paroxysm, and 
that this excess disappears under the use of quinine. 
Dr. H. Hartshorne made some remarks On the best m.eans of advancing Bio- 
logical Science at the present time, adverting to the danger, which he considered 
a principal one in the science of the present century, of logismophobia, i. e. the 
dread of reasoning, as opposed to simple observation, and expressing the view, 
that, in every scheme of scientific inquiry, there should be, after the model of 
Bacon's " New Atalantis," room, not only for observers and experimenters, but 
also for ' ' depredators, " " compilers, ' ' and ' ' interpreters of nature. ' ' Dr. Harts- 
horne made an appeal, also, in favor of the organization of a system of joint 
investigation, by observation, experiment and otherwise, by members volun- 
teering for the purpose, in connection with important questions or problems, 
illustrating this proposition by a series of questions, which might be found 
capable of determination in such a mode. 
Dr. Leidy, Dr. Richardson and others expressed their approbation of this 
proposal for organized investigation. 
Dr. Hammond, in connection with it, gave an account of the Grerman "Verein 
fiir gemeinschaftliche Arbeiten," which has been in existence for several years, 
numbering many hundreds of members, on the Continent and in Great Britain, 
and issuing, in its archives, a remarkable number of interesting and valuable 
productions. 
March 1st. Dr. Walter F. Atlee presented a preparation of an acephalous 
child, and read a paper, giving a description of the monstrosity.f 
Dr. Leidy described a similar one, having neither head nor arms, now in the 
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. 
Dr. J. C. Morris inquired whether the state of the placenta had been exam- 
ined into in either of those cases ? Dr. Morris had noticed, that in several in- 
stances of acephalous foetus, fatty degeneration of the placenta had occurred. 
Dr. M. had also attended a patient, who was delivered at full term of a foetus, 
which had died at the 7th month ; fatty degeneration of the placenta was 
found to be complete. The same mother was afterwards delivered of a child 
at full term, but which was not more developed than is usual at the 7th month. 
It has been imagined by some, that fatty degeneration of the placenta at the 
end of pregnancy, may be the cause of labor ; but such a case as that just 
mentioned, tends to disprove this. 
Dr. Leidy remarked, that the condition of the placenta could not acccount 
for such a monstrosity as the one exhibited by Dr. Atlee ; as this, from its 
nature, must have been determined in the embryo : having no upper extremi- 
ties, as well as no head. The upper extremities always pullulate before the 
formation of the placenta. In this case, also, the placenta must have been 
healthy enough to furnish nutriment for all parts of the body, which were 
present.

Dr. Hammond described a canine monstrosity obtained by him at Fort Riley, 
Kansas, in which, besides the presence of six legs and several supernumerary 
toes, there was an entire absence of intestines and anus, the stomach ending 
in a cul de sac. 
Dr. Atlee said, that he had, in his paper, said nothing of the causes of mon- 
strosities, they being, in fact, altogether unknown. Only three modes of 
causation appear to be possible : 1. Defect in the germ ; 2. Emotion, such as 
fright, &c, in the mother ; 3. Accidental violence acting upon the foetus during 
gestation. In regard to neither of these can we obtain, at present, accurate 
knowledge. 
Dr. CoKSE observed, that some modifying causes are occasionally obvious ; 
as, irregular contractions of the uterus, such as are known to occur, and which, 
by pressure, may act upon the foetus. Dr. Corse possesses a specimen which 
illustrates this ; in which there is no neck, and only a vesicle in place of the 
brain. In many cases of acephalous monstrosity, Dr. Corse would suppose ex- 
ternal causes to be most probable. 
Dr. Leidy thought it difficult to conceive how external causes could act upon 
the embryo at so early a stage, and while so minute as it must be at the time 
when such a deformity is produced. Dr. Leidy alluded to the experiments of 
Newport upon the fecundation of the frog, as suggesting the possibility that 
the defect might occur, in connection with the act of conception itself. 
March 15th. Dr. S. W. Mitchell read a paper, entitled " Observations on the 
Blood of the Sturgeon,^^ illustrated by drawings of crystals obtained from the 
albuminoid corpuscles of that fish ; and containing, amongst other interesting 
points, new reasons for the belief, that Lehmann's opinion of the coloring mat- 
ter of the blood being essential to the constitution of blood-crystals, is erro- 
neous. 
Dr. Mitchell further remarked, upon his having noticed, with surprise, that, 
when a drop of sturgeon's blood was left at rest until its edges began to dry, 
the nuclei of its corpuscles, which are easily seen, approached one another ; 
so that, if there were several corpuscles, their nuclei would seem to be in 
contact. The phenomenon resembled, somewhat, the nummulation of the 
corpuscles, at the beginning of an inflammation. Tlie mere drying up of the 
corpuscles did not explain this ; the explanation was not obvious. 
Dr. H. Hartshorne inquired, whether ordinary gravitative attraction might 
not explain it, as it does the approaching of light particles floating in a liquid 
to each other, or to the sides of the vessel ? 
Dr. Mitchell thought not ; doubting, even, whether the latter phenomena 
were explicable by gravitative attraction alone. 
Dr. Hammond called attention to the fact, mentioned in Dr. Mitchell's paper, 
that he had not succeeded in obtaining blood-crystals from the fresh blood of 
the human finger. Dr. Hammond had made the attempt with blood of the 
soft-shelled turtle (Trionyx) ; during the first week he could find no crystals : 
but, two months' afterwards, they were distinctly observable. 
Dr. Mitchell had repeatedly failed in the attempt with blood of the water- 
turtles of the vicinity of Philadelphia. He had, however, in such experi- 
ments, observed certain saline crystals, which did not undergo granulation 
and fibrillation before solution ; which Dr .M. believes to be a test. 
Dr. Morris considered, nevertheless, that the crystals, mentioned by Dr. 
Hammond, were true blood-crystals ; being, as he himself had witnessed, 
witliin the blood-corpuscles. 
Dr. Leidy remembered having once seen a similar occurrence in the blood of 
a salamander. He had, also, noticed octohedral crystals within the epithelial' 
cells of a lepidopterous insect, the Arctia Isabella; which is a caterpillar, 
found in winter under stones and leaves : each nucleus of an epithelial cell 
was the centre of an octohedron.

rROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
[Biolog. 
Dr. Mitchell mentioned, that he had found the "greatest facility in obtain- 
ing hnman blood-crystals from pneumonic clots. 
Dr. Morris expressed the opinion that blood-crystallization is a result of 
change in the albuminoid matter of the corpuscles, under the action of oxygen ; 
the crystals being seldom formed without exposure to the air, or, at least, with- 
out time for partial cadaveric decomposition. They are, therefore, derivative 
in their nature. 
Leaving this subject, â Dr. Morris stated, that he had been interested, while 
observing some plants in bloom near a closed window, in finding a deposit of 
moisture upon the glass, immediately opposite to each flower; there being 
none opposite to the leaves. This was not what he should have been led to 
expect, from the recognized action of the leaves, in concentrating the sap of 
plants by evaporation. Opposite to the flowers of a Camellia, there had also 
been found a collection of a viscid sweet substance. 
Dr. Leidy supposed this sweet substance to be the secretion ejected by an 
aphis, which sucks the juices of flowers, and throws out continually what is 
called, as it appears on many plants, honey-dew ; which constitutes the value 
of the aphides to ants, whence they have been called ant-cows. On grape- 
vines, in summer, the black aphides abound, and black ants may be seen 
running up and down, eating this substance, thrown out when the aphis is 
irritated. It has the power of ejecting it to a considerable distance. On 
the flowers and other parts of the Ailanthus and Tulip-poplar, drops of it, 
darkened by dust, are often visible ; the Camellia is especially well adapted 
for their display. 
Mr. E. TiLGHMAN exhibited and explained briefly his application of photogra- 
phy to the construction of goniometers and micrometers. It consists, essentially, 
in taking by a microscopic camera a photograph on glass of a graduated semi- 
circle, of proper size to place on the diaphragm of an ordinary Huygheman 
eye-piece, so as, by super-position, to measure the angle of microscopic crys- 
tals. The base of the graduated semicircle may also be divided as a micro- 
meter, so that the same instrument may be used for the two purposes. By 
advancing or withdrawing the microscopic camera to or from the negative, put 
up against the light, the graduated semicircle may be adapted to any sized eye- 
piece. The cost of this construction is very small. Mr. Tilghman anticipates 
making a fuller report upon the subject at some future time. 
Dr. Leidy exhibited a number of sections of the human cranium, illustrating 
the beautiful mechanism by which union of the dififerent parts of the skull is 
effected, not only in man, but throughout the whole animal kingdom ; and 
which is especially striking before the sutures are co-ossified. One section 
was horizontal, one vertical antero-posteriorly, and four vertical laterally. In 
all, minute examination displayed the most exquisite overlapping and inter- 
junction of parts, completing that adaptation to its contents, which is obvious in 
the form and whole construction of the cranium. 
April 12th. Dr. J. Darby read an elaborate paper on the Supra- Renal Cap- 
sules; advancing the opinion, based on original observation and research, that 
those organs are so important to the normal condition of the blood, and to the 
functional actions of the nervous system, as to be almost indispensable to life. 
Dr. W. A. Hammond read a description of a Case of Fatty Degeneration of the 
Heart, in which death followed the inhalation of chloroform. The impurity of the 
chloroform (or chloric ether) used in this case was such, that Dr. Hammond 
supposed it possible that this might aid in accounting for the fatal result. 
Dr. H. Hartshorne, in connection with the same subject, gave an account of 
some experiments made by himself with the inhalation of deodorized alcohol. 
An inhaling apparatus on the ordinary principle was used, air being introduced 
only through the alcohol. After breathing through the tube of the apparatus 
for ten minutes, a feeling of exhilaration was produced, without somnolence or 
circulatory excitement, but with some diminution of sensibility ; and, in one 
instance, with forcible, though not accelerated palpitation of the heart. The 
[April,

11 
coaclasion arrived at was, that any increase in the danger of ansesthesia from 
chloroform could hardly be expected to result from the addition to it of pure 
alcohol. This, of course, would not apply to the ethereal or other substances 
often associated with it. 
Dr. Hammond mentioned that the preparation alluded to in his paper con- 
tained, besides other impurities, a small percentage of muriatic acid ; Yerj much 
less, however, than had been reported as contained in a specimen employed in 
one of the London hospitals. 
Dr. J. G. Morris supposed that the muriatic acid might have had some influ- 
ence in causing death : the lungs being congested, and the right side of the 
heart loaded with blood, while the left side was empty ; as would be the case if 
the pulmonic circulation were interfered with by an irrespirable substance. 
Dr. W. F. Atlee considered the occurrence of vomiting, shortly before death, 
to have been an evidence that the brain was powerfully affected, which alone 
might suffice to cause death. 
Dr. Hays observed that it is impossible to account for the deaths which oc- 
cur under the inhalation of chloroform. Very recently a case has been recorded 
which strikingly exhibits this : in which the chloroform employed was carefully 
examined, and found entirely pure ; the quantity used was small, the person 
administering it, one experienced in its use in an English Hospital ; and every 
care was exercised even as to its sufficient dilution with air. The body of the 
patient was examined after death, and nothing was found to explain the result. 
In cases of undoubted fatty degeneration of the heart, chloroform has repeatedly 
been given with safety: one â v^riter upon the subject going so far as to say that 
such degeneration affords no objection to its use. In some instances the same 
patient had inhaled chloroform, from the same bottle, two or three times, with- 
out disadvantage, and yet it proved fatal to him at last. 
Dr. Leidy had noticed the same uncertainty or variability of action of chlo- 
roform in experiments upon animals. A strong, healthy cat was destroyed by 
breathing an amount of chloroform, which several others, at the same time, 
inhaled harmlessly. In his own person, Dr. Leidy had found one of the most 
marked effects of chloroform to be a total loss of muscular power. 
Dr. B. H. CoATES believed chloroform to act poisonously, by directly dimin- 
ishing the action of the heart. The absolute amount of vital power in different 
individuals or organs cannot be calculated ; but, if the heart be in a state of 
fatty degeneration, its vitality must be thereby diminished. The rapidity of 
absorption by the lungs, as demonstrated in experiments recorded by Dr. Coates 
and others, aids in baffling our calculations. The admixture of other articles 
with chloroform increases the ambiguity ; and to avoid danger, the greatest 
care is needed in regard to the dose. 
Dr. F. G. Smith inquired whether the state of consciousness of the patient was 
noted in either of the cases alluded to ? 
Dr. Hammond stated that the man whose case had been narrated in his paper 
was not conscious during the period immediately preceding death. 
Dr. F. G. Smith observed that the action of chloroform may be traced more 
directly in the muscular than in the nervous organs ; causing a destruction of 
the irritability of muscular fibre. An analogy is presented to this in some 
experiments reported by Dr. Rand, in which the leaflets of mimosa pudica, 
exposed to chloroform, lost all their contractibility. Some, at least, of the cases 
of sudden death under anaesthesia may be explicable upon this principle. Hav- 
ing been repeatedly placed under anaesthetic influence, Dr. Smith had found, 
that while his consciousness was not at all affected, being able to note the beat- 
ing of his heart, and to hear and see all that was going on around him, perhaps 
with even excited sensibility, a total inability to exert the voluntary muscles 
was produced. The sensation might be described as that of being flattened out. 
Dr. W. F. Atlee recalled the suggestive fact, that a few drops of chloroform 
let fall on a bundle of ciliated epithelium of the frog, will arrest the ciliary 
motion at once.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 
[Biolog. 
Dr. J. C. Morris narrated the singular case of a ladj,bj whom a considerable 
amount of chloroform was inhaled to relieve morbid vigilance, producing the 
appearance of sleep, and even stertorous respiration, yet without annulling con- 
sciousness ; as was shown by her soon re-acquiriag the power of motion, and 
describing the movements made by those about her. There seemed here to be 
a retention of sensibility, with a loss of voluntary motion. 
Dr. Woodward had noticed similar phenomena in persons using chloroform 
by inhalation as an intoxicating agent. He had known several persons, one a 
medical man, who were in the habit, for months together, of using it in this 
manner every day after dinner. In all of these there appeared to be a loss of 
muscular power with retention of consciousness. 
Dr. H. Hartshornb had formed the opinion that the principal action of chlo- 
roform is upon the cerebro-spinal axis, resembling, in its suddenness of effect in 
fatal cases, some of the experiments of Wilson Philip, and others, in which im- 
mediate arrest of the heart's action was produced by destroying the brain with 
a hammer, or the spinal cord by inserting a heated rod into the canal. The 
destruction of the spinal marrow will produce, also, general relaxation of the 
voluntary muscles. At the same time, the cases mentioned suggest the proba- 
bility that the influence of chloroform may be exerted upon the different nerve- 
centres in greater or less degree in different cases. It is not impossible that 
fatal anaesthesia of the medulla oblongata, destroying life by arrest of respira- 
tion, might occur, without prior annihilation of sensorial consciousness. 
3Iay 3d. Dr. Leidy exhibited a drawing of the Echinococcus hominifs, commonly 
known under the name of hydatid. The specimen from which it was taken was 
found in a tumor seated in the muscles of the right iliac region, which had 
been supposed to consist of impacted fneces in the colon. The patient had been 
dead several days, when the body was injected with chloride of zinc ; yet two 
days afterwards the parasites were still alive. None of the injection, however, 
had come into contact with it, as it had no direct communication with the body. 
The Echinococcus is the larval form of a tape worm. Dr. Leidy described its 
mode of propagation and of locating itself in the body. 
3Iai/ Vlth. Dr. J. J. Woodward read a paper* describing three cancerous 
tumors, which displayed interesting peculiarities, illustrating one mode of 
development of carcinoma from a liquid blastema, enveloped in a cyst. The 
paper opposed the opinion expressed by Rokitansky, that cancer is essentially 
an albuminosis. 
Dr. Leidy exhibited a minnow, caught in the Schuylkill, having disease of 
the scales of the upper part of the head and about the orbit. The scales were 
dilated, and filled with delicate organic cells, much resembling carcinomatous 
cells. They were certainly not confervoid or fungous, but were purely patho- 
logical, and thus of interest as a specimen of diseased formation in a fish. Dis- 
ease, in the inferior animals, and even in plants, is deserving of study by medical 
men, since it may throw light upon the nature of disease in man. 
June 7tli. â Dr. Henry Hartshorne read a paper 'â ^On the hearing of Physiolo- 
gy on Paleontology.''^ Referred to a special Committee. 
Dr. J. J. Woodward made the following verbal communication, in regard to 
the ^'Examination of a fungous groioth upon the head of a Hydrargyra fasciata,''^ 
caught in the Schuylkill river, and referred to him by Dr. Leidy at the last 
meeting of the Department. 
This fish presented a dark greenish blue fungous mass upon its head, and 
several greenish discolorations on various parts of its body. Examination 
showed the mass to consist of a cryptogamous plant, in the meshes of which 
loosened and partially disentegrated cells from the epithelium of the scales 
were abundantly entangled. The dark color was due to the presence of isolated

13 
pigment cells identical with those of the pigmentary layer of the scale. The 
same plant occurred, though less abundantly, on all the discolorations above 
referred to. The plant resembled more closely the Torula cerevisia than any 
other. Like it, it was composed of cells with distinct nuclei, isolated, or dis- 
posed in rows, the terminal cells of any row being always of diminished size. 
But it diifered from the Torula in presenting a distinct greenish hue. 
He has been unable to find it figured in any of the books. 
Dr. J. H. Slack alluded to the fungous growth sometimes met with on the 
sides of fishes, and not unfrequently fatal to them. 
Dr. Leidy remarked that this had been ascertained to be the Aclilya 
prolifera; a mycelium, with processes terminating in capsules, which emit 
ciliated and contractile sporules. Weakness of the fish appears to predispose 
to the attack. It is often found on the gold-fish. 
Mr. Queen exhibited a series of beautiful micro-photographs, prepared by 
Mr. Rehn, presenting views of blood, spicula of sponge, Acarus scabiei, &c. 
Dr. J. C. Morris related the particulars of a case of extra-uterine pregnancy, 
which occurred in the practice of a friend of his, and which will be given to the 
profession in a short time through a medical journal. The foetus remained four 
years in a sac within the abdomen ; at the close of this time a fistulous connec- 
tion was established with the rectum, and the child (of eight months) was 
brought through the anus by the aid of narrow-blade d forceps. 
Dr. Morris also called the attention of the Department to the fact stated by 
Dutrochet, that the endosmotic current takes place with great rapidity from an 
acidulated fluid towards a neutral or slightly alkaline one. The amount of 
acidity exercises a marked influence upon the current ; and if it be considerable, 
destroys it altogether. We are more in a condition now to see the application 
of this fact in the economy of digestion, than when it was believed that all of 
the food, after being ehymified in the stomach, was sent to the intestines to be 
converted into chyle, prior to its absorption into the circulatory system. It 
may be readily conceived that the gastric mucous membrane secretes, especi- 
ally during digestion, a watery fluid containing a ]3rinciple capable of splitting, 
by a sort of fermentation, into lactic acid, such a process being rendered still 
more probable by the considerable amount of atmospheric air which finds its 
way to the stomach, mixed with the saliva and food. The presence of this 
acid will fully account for the occasional occurrence of free muriatic acid, as 
chloride of sodium is readily decomposed by it at an elevated temperature into 
lactate of soda and muriatic acid ; and the neutral phosphates may in the same 
way be rendered acid. This would then account readily for the occurrence of 
the free acid in the gastric juice ; while the free acid would again promote a 
rapid current into the blood-vessels of the fluid now charged to a greater or 
less extent with the nitrogenised elements of the food. 
An explanation is thus aflbrded also of the nausea and vomiting produced 
by an excess of free acid in the stomach, quantities of fluid being thus 
evacuated sometimes, which almost exceed credence. In this case the excess 
of SiOidi prevents the endosmose of the fluid into the blood-vessels, and causes it 
to accumulate, while the fresh exudations undergo the same change ; until, 
finally, the overburdened stomach disgorges its troublesome load. 
If we next consider the acid fluid of muscles as opposed to the alkaline 
capillary fluid we have a similar condition of things manifested ; and the con- 
centrated arterial blood becomes loaded with the water, carbonic acid, and 
other products of muscular disintegration, a counter-current meanwhile carry- 
ing albuminoid material to the fibrilla for their renovation. Here we may find 
the explanation of the increased nutrition of a muscle that is frequently exer- 
cised ; the very act of destruction of the tissue by its contraction, causing the 
endosmotic currents to flow with increased rapidity. 
There is some reason to believe, that all secretions are neutral or alkaline

cesses set up in them, sometimes with extreme rapidity, as in the case of the 
urine. We know that oxalic acid must be the result of some such change ; 
and yet renal calculi of oxalate of lime are not very rare. 
June list. â Dr. J. J. Woodward read a paper entitled " Histological Remarks 
upon a Secondary Cancer of the Pleura;'''' in which evidence was given in sup- 
port of the assertion that cancerous blastema contains fibrin as well as albumen. 
The most remarkable points set forth in the examination of the case narrated 
in the paper, were, 1st, the extent of the pleural surface occupied by the new 
formation ; 2nd, the quantity of the latter and of its exudation ; 3rd, the failure 
of development of its elementary forms beyond the stage of nuclei. 
A brief discussion took place upon the subject of the paper, between Dr. 
Woodward and Dr. Morris ; the paper was referred to the Committee on 
Pathology. 
Sept. Qth. Dr. J. J. Woodward described briefly some recent observations 
made by him upon the cell-wall of pus-cells, separated from their contents by 
endosmose in urine. A more elaborate communication will be made by him 
upon the subject, hereafter. 
Dr. J. C. Morris remarked upon the results of a post-mortem examination 
of a horse, which had been affected with frequent urination, along with other 
symptoms, for some time before death. Bright's disease of both kidneys, in 
the fatty stage, was discovered. 
Dr. Woodward stated that he had observed fatty degeneration of the liver, 
very often, in animals exposed in our markets and elsewhere. Much of the 
mutton of our markets, moreover, he had ascertained to be the meat of tuber- 
culous sheep. 
In connection with the same subject, Dr. Morris alluded to an epidemic 
among horses, in Philadelphia, two years ago, which he considered to have had 
the characters of typhoid fever. Careful examination, in fact, may detect the 
occurrence of most of our ordinary diseases in the domestic animals. 
Dr. Corse had inspected the lungs of three or four hundred sheep, from 
which he had obtained some ten specimens of well marked tuberculosis. 
Nearly twenty-five per cent., however, of the sheep exhibited more or less 
tuberculous deposit ; the existence of which he was enabled to trace to an 
evident connection with bad feeding and keeping. Dr. Corse had also re- 
peatedly found well-marked cancer of the liver in oxen. 
Dr. Woodward stated that the general symptoms and local history of tuber- 
culosis in animals are quite parallel to those connected with its occurrence in 
the human subject ; although the proportionate amount of general or sym- 
pathetic disorder is somewhat less in the former. 
Catarrhal and broncliitic affections frequently occur in cattle. Cysts in the 
kidney, and calculi in the bladder, are common in cattle. Dogs are especially 
liable to cancer ; but it occurs in cats also. Rats appear to be particularly 
liable to a number of diseases. 
Mr. TiLGHMAN inquired whether artificial or abnormal circumstances could 
be shewn by observation to account for tuberculosis in animals ? 
Dr. Woodward affirmed the opinion that such will prove to be the case ; 
although full evidence is at the present time wanting in regard to it. The close 
resemblance of the normal structures in the anatomy of all the vertebrata 
should lead us to expect similarity in their pathology and etiology al*b. 
Sept. 20th. Dr. W.'A. Hammond read a paper " On the Secondary Formation 
of Blood-crystals;" which was referred to a special committee.

Dr. CoKSE exhibited a specimen of morbid growth of hair upon the cornea 
of an ox. 
Dr. Leidy mentioned, in explanation of this monstrosity, that the hairs in 
the specimen were the result of the excessive development of very minute 
hairs naturally existing at the inner canthus of the eye, in connection with the 
caruncula lachrymalis, and corresponding with the nictitating membrane. 
Dr. Hammond stated that he had been requested by the " Verein fur gemein- 
schaftliche Arbeiten^^ to present to the Department the new forms of 'â ^Krankheits 
TahelW'' issued by the Verein, and to desire some action of the Department 
thereupon. A Committee was appointed upon the subject, consisting of Drs. 
Hammond, Woodward and H. Hartshorne. 
On the Secondary Formation of Blood Crystals. 
BY WILLIAM A. HAMMOND, M. D. 
Assistant Surgeon, United States Army. 
A few days ago, whilst viewing a slide on which I had four years since mounted 
some blood-discs of a common prairie snake, {Eutaiiiia elcgans) I was surprised to 
find scattered amongst their corpuscles a number of well marked acicular crj's- 
tals, most of them connected in groups, and radiating from a centre as shown 
in the drawing. 
I had not inspected this slide for about five months, and at that time I aiu 
confident the crystals were not present. I had constantly before been in the 
habit of looking at these corpuscles, but had never previously perceived cry- 
stals. 
This is the second time it has occurred to me to discover crystals on slides 
containing blood-discs which must have been formed at a considerable period 
after the preparation of the specimen. The first instance was on a slide on 
which were mounted blood-corpuscles of the soft-shell turtle, [Trionyx ferox). 
Crystals were found on this, some months after it was prepared. On a previous 
occasion, I mentioned this circumstance to the Department. 
The discs in both cases were mounted dry, and covered with paper in the

usual manner. They were obtained by the ordinary process. The slides, pre- 
viously to the mounting, were well washed in water, and subsequently in 
ether, as were also their glass covers. 
The crystals are in too small a quantity to definitely determine their nature, 
but I presume them to be haematoidin. They approach somewhat in form to 
a set of figures of this substance given by Funke, in his Atlas, but its cr} stal- 
tine characters are so various, that it is difficult to establish its presence from 
them alone. 
It is probable that if the members would go over carefully with the micro- 
scope, their specimens of blood-corpuscles, especially those of reptiles, they might 
also meet with instances such as the foregoing, and that the cause of the for- 
mation of blood-crystals at so advanced a period, after the mounting of the 
corpuscles and their apparently thorough drying, might be thereby discovered. 
The accompanying drawing was made by the Camera Lucida. The discs and 
crystals are magnified 300 diameters. 
Oct. Ath, The General Committee of the Department presented a partial report, 
relating to its organization, in compliance with the regulation therefor, and the 
preparation of a series of questions for investigation. The questions were re- 
ferred again to the Committee, with directions to add to their number, and 
report to a future meeting. 
Oct. ISth. Dr. Morris exhibited a young Emys , having a hernial protrusion, 
which appeared to be at the point of connection with the umbilical vesicle. 
The most interesting feature of the specimen was its early stage of develop- 
ment, illustrating the period of transition of cartilage into bone. 
Dr. Woodward mentioned, that since the time of his remarks to the Depart- 
ment in regard to pus-corpuscles, he had had no less than ten opportunities of 
examining pus under somewhat similar circumstances to those then alluded 
to ; the pus having found its way into urine, in which it remained for several 
hours. He had, in all these instances, found that on one side (seldom on both) 
an elevation of the cell-wall took-place, which he referred to endosmose. 
Dr. Leidy remarked, that these facts agreed with his own observations ; as 
he had never recognized the adherence of the granules of the pus-corpuscle to 
the cell-wall, and considered the diagnosis of the pus-corpuscle, based upon 
this adherence, to fail altogether. 
Drs. Woodward and Leidy further agreed in the view that no positive diag- 
nostic exists between exudation-corpuscles and pus-corpuscles ; that proposed, 
for example, in regard to the number of nuclei, being quite insufficient. Dr. 
Woodward favored the opinion of Carl Wedl, that the pus-corpuscle is a 
pathological deformation of the white corpuscle of the blood. 
A discussion also took place in regard to the existence of mucus-corpuscles in 
the mouth, &c. 
Dr. Leidy considered these to be normally pr-'sent in the fluids of the mouth, 
as he had constantly found them in his own saliva, during perfect health. 
Drs. Hammond, Mitchell and Morris adhered to the same conclusion. If the 
saliva be collected in a test tube, and the mucus be allowed to separate from 
the secretion of the true salivary glands, the mucus-corpuscles will be found 
in abundance. 
Dr. Atlee mentioned the statement of some observers, that they were 
found in the saliva of domestic animals, but not in that of the wild. 
Passing to the subject of cancer, Dr. Leidy alluded to some preparations 
which he had seen in the valuable collection of Kiernan, in which the structure 
of the tumor having been by a peculiar process removed from the vessels, the 
latter, in many instances, presented a msirked sjnral arrangement ; the cancers 
having been obtained from all parts of the body, and being of various magni- 
tudes.

Dr. H. Hartshorne inquired whether the mode of separation might possibly 
account for this appearance of the vessels ? 
Dr. Woodward mentioned that the wood cuts in Carl Wedl's " Rudiments 
of Pathological Histology" show a splendid arrangement of the vessels in n. 
number of new formations, cancerous and otherwise. 
The Report of the General Committee was presented by its Recorder, Dr. 
Walter F. Atlee, and adopted. 
The subjects recommended by the Committee for immediate investigation 
are the following ; 
1. The formation of fat in the bodies of animals, when fed only on food con- 
taining no oleaginous matter. 
2. The changes occurring in the excreta during fevers and inflammations. 
3. The exact cause and nature of the rigor mortis. 
4. The influence of the alkaloids, morphia, quinia, cinchonia and strychnia, 
upon the metamorphosis of tissue. 
5. The circumstances which determine the existence of sugar in the blood, 
and which occasion its presence in the urine. 
6. The physiological position of the blood-fibrin. 
7. The elimination of ammonia from the lungs in health and disease. 
8. The absorption of muscular fibre ; in which portion of the alimentary 
'janal is it eflected ? 
9. The statistics of height, weight, &c., of the human race in North America. 
10. The variations in the amount of ozone in the atmosphere, and their con- 
nection with epidemics. 
11. The influence of ingesta on the composition of milk. 
12. The existence of an epithelium in the air-vesicles of the human lung. 
13. The comparison of mucus, pus and exudation- corpuscles, &c., with eacli 
other, and with the white corpuscles of the blood, and their relation to epithe- 
lial structures. 
14. The minute anatomy of nerves and nerve-centres. 
Other subjects, which had been proposed to the Committee, were also re- 
ported as appropriate for future investigation. 
A member of the Department was named in connection with each of thei 
above subjects, to act as Chairman or Director of a voluntary committee of 
such members, or others, as may desire to take part in their investigation. 
On the adoption of the Report, a brief discussion occurred, as to the pro- 
priety of publishing the above list of subjects, in anticipation of the accom- 
plishment of results. It being understood, however, that the object in view 
was to invite and encourage joint labor, which, without some publicity, would 
be impossible, authority was given for printing one hundred copies of the Re- 
port for the use of the members. 
Nov. 1st. Dr. J. J. Woodward read a paper entitled ' ' Remarks on a remark- 
able form of the basic Phosphate of Ammonia and Magnesia occurring in the 
urine of a patient suffering under cancer of the bladder." The committee 
on Organic Chemistry, to which this paper was referred, reported in favor of 
its publication in a medical journal to be selected by the author. 
Dr. Hammond read the following paper : 
On the Action of certain Vegetable Diuretics. 
BY WILLIAM A. HAMMOND, M. D. 
Assistant Surgeon U. S. Army. 
The ensuing investigations consist mainly of repetitions of those performed 
some years since by Krahmer, and subsequently by Bird. They have reference 
to the appreciation of the influence of squill, juniper, digitalis and colchicum, 
over the quantity of the urine, its specific gravity and the annount of its solid

organic and inorganic constituents. They were all performed upon healthy 
adult males. 
The quantity of urine was determined in cubic centimetres, and the weight 
of the solids in grammes. 
The method employed for the determination of the whole amount of solid 
matter was as follows : 
Ten cubic centimetres of the urine were evaporated to as complete dryness as 
possible m vacuo over sulphuric acid, and the residue accurately weighed. By 
simple proportion the amount of solids in the whole quantity of urine was 
easily ascertained. 
Although it is impossible to get rid of all the water by this process, the 
quantity remaining is extremely small, and the results obtained are far more 
accurate than those yielded by evaporating to dryness in the water bath as 
generally practised. No matter how carefully this latter method is conducted, 
the loss of urea by decomposition is always an importent item, and involves far 
more serious errors than the imperfect desiccation by the former process. 
For the determination of the amounts of organic and inorganic constituents 
separately, the solid residue obtained as above was mixed with ten or fifteen 
drops of moderately strong nitric acid, and gently heated till the mass was well 
dried. The heat was then gradually raised till all the carbon was consumed, 
and the mass in consequence became white. It was then cooled m vacuo over 
sulphuric acid and weighed. The inorganic matter wns thus determined and 
the loss showed the proportion of organic substance. 
Digitalis. â The subject of the experiments with this substance, was about 
twenty-five years of age and in good health. J'or the three days immediately 
preceding the commencement of the investigations the average quantity of urine 
daily excreted by him was 1474.5 cubic centimetres, the specific gravity was 
1024.30, and the average total amount of solid matter was 75.31 grammes of 
which 30.17 grammes were inorganic, and 45.14 organic constituents. The 
digitalis was given in the form of the officinal tincture in doses of 20 minims 
three times in 24 hours, and was continued for three consecutive days. During 
this period the manner of living (food, drink, exercise, &c.,) was as nearly as 
possible the same as during the preliminary investigations. 
1st day. The urine passed on this day was of a pale straw color and feeble 
iicid reaction ; quantity 1950 cubic centimetres; specific gravity 1013.25 j total 
solids 69.98 grammes, of which amount 31.27 were inorganic and 38.71 organic 
matter. The action of the digitalis was not manifested otherwise than by its 
efte.ct upon the urine. 
2nd day. The urine passed on this day was of similar physical character to 
that above mentioned. The quantity was 1873.6 centimetres, the specific 
gravity 1014.32, and the total solids 63.74 grammes. The inorganic solids 
amounted to 30.15 grammes, and the organic to 33.49. 
The pulse on this day was somewhat slower and fuller than on the previous 
day. 
3rd day. The quantity of urine evacuated on this day was 1624.9 cubic centi- 
metres, and of specific gravity 1020.04, The total amount of solid matter was 
67.29 grammes, of which 33.19 were inorganic and 34.10 organic. 
The color, reaction and odor of the urine were similar to those of the two 
previous days. 
The characteristic effects of the digitalis upon the action of the heart were 
well marked during this day. 
The effect of the digitalis in increasing the amount of urine is seen to have 
been greatest on the first day. On the second day it had fallen somewhat, and 
on the third was but 150 cubic centimetres greater than when no digitalis was 
taken. The solids, it is seen, were less than the normal standard from the com- 
mencement, were still further reduced on the second day, and on the third 
were slightly increased. This diminution is perceived to have been owing to 
the lessened amount of organic matter excreted. The inorganic substances 
were somewhat increased in amount over the ordinary proportion.

Juniper. â The experiments with this substance were conducted on a healthy 
man thirty-five years of age. The average condition of his urine for the three 
days immediately preceding the investigations was as follows : quantity 1237.5 
cubic centimetres, specific gravity 1022.50; total solids 61.23 grammes, of which 
23.12 were inorganic and 38.11 organic matter. It was of ordinary color and 
odor, and of strong acid reaction. 
Sixteen ounces of the officinal infusion of the berries of the Juniperus commu- 
nis were taken during the twenty-four hours, and the manner of living kept as 
nearly as possible to correspond with that of the preliminary experiments. 
1st day. For this day the quantity of urine amounted to 1732 cubic centi- 
metres, the specific gravity of which was 1016.38; the total solids were 62.75 
grammes ; of this amount 25.43 grammes were inorganic, and 37.32 organic 
constituents. 
The urine was of a pale straw color and gave off" the characteristic odor pro- 
duced by juniper. The reaction was feebly acid. 
2d day. The quantity of urine passed on this day was 1885.2 cubic centime- 
tres. The specific gravity was 1014.15, and the total solids 58.49 grammes, 
22.17 of which were inorganic, and 36.22 organic matter. The physical cha- 
racteristics were similar to those of the day before. The reaction was barely 
acid. 
3d day. On this day the quantity of urine was 1672.5 cubic centimetres, with 
a specific gravity of 1018.41. The total solids amounted to 63.27 grammes, of 
which 27.50 were inorganic and 35.73 organic matter. The physical charac- 
teristics and reaction were the same as on the previous day. 
From these experiments it is seen that whilst the quantity of urine was materi- 
ally increased by the juniper, the amount of solid matter, as a whole, was but 
slightly affected, the loss in organic matter being about compensated for by the 
increase in the inorganic. 
Squill.â -The experiments with this substance were instituted upon myself, 
and were conducted upon the same general principles as the foregoing series. 
The average daily quantity of urine, for the three days preceding the investiga- 
tions, was 1358 cubic centimetres. The specific gravity was 1023.51, and the 
total solids 69.35 grammes ; of this amount 27.22 were inorganic and 42.13 or- 
ganic matter, 
I took two grains of the dried bulb of the Scilla marilima three times in the 
twenty-four hours. The other conditions remaining the same as in the prelimi- 
nary examination of the urine. 
1st day. The quantity of urine passed on this day was 1572 cubic centimetres 
of 1020.34 specific gravity. The total solid matter was 60.67 grammes, 31.07 
of this amount being inorganic and 29.60 organic constituents. The urine was 
of feeble acid reaction. 
2d day. Quantity of urine 1493.5 cubic centimetres, specific gravity 1020.90. 
total solids 58.22 grammes, inorganic matter 30.15, organic 28.07 grammes. 
The reaction, &c., were the same as on the preceding day. 
3d day. On this day the quantity of urine amounted to 1535 cubic centime- 
tres', and was of 1019.37 specific gravity. The total amount of solid matter 
was 61.58 grammes, of which 30.58 were inorganic and 31.00 organic constitu- 
ents. The reaction, color, &c., were unchanged. 
From the above experiments it is perceived that the action of the squill was 
similar to that of the digitalis and juniper, i.e. causing an increase in the water 
of the urine and inorganic solids, but a reduction of the amount of organic mat- 
ter. The loss of organic matter was considerably greater than with either of 
the other substances. 
CoLCHicuM. â The investigations into the action of this substance were per- 
formed upon a healthy man 28 years of age. The urine for the three days imme- 
diately preceding the commencement of the experiments, was of the following 
daily average character. Quantity 1230 cubic centimetres, specific gravity 
1025.08; total solids 63.12 grammes, inorganic matter 29.83 and organic 33.29, 
The reaction was very strongly acid.

Oae and a half drachms of the officinal tincture of the seeds of the Colchicum 
auiumnale were given ihree times in twenty- four hours, and continued for 
three days. During this period the food, exercise, &c., were as nearly as possi- 
ble the same as during the preliminary series. 
1st day. The quantity of urine passed on this day was 1595. 7 cubic centime- 
tres, with a specific gravity of 1024.37. The total solids amounted to 77.29 
grammes, the inorganic matter of which was 36.50 grammes, and the organic 
20.79 grammes. The reaction was stongly acid. 
2d day. Quantity of urine 1484.1 cubic centimetres, specific gravity 1024.31 ; 
total solids 75.22 grammes. The amount of inorganic matter was 35.01 gram- 
mes, and of organic 40.21. The reaction was very strongly acid. 
3d day. On this day the quantity of urine amounted to 1620 cubic centime- 
tres and was of 1022.06 specific gravity. The total amount of solid matter was 
79.33 grammes, of which 34.20 were inorganic and 45.13 organic constituents. 
Reaction strongly acid. 
It is thus perceived that the action of the colchicum, as compared with that 
of the other substances experimented with, was very remarkable, it being the 
only one with which there was an increase in the amount of solid matter elimi- 
nated, both organic and inorganic.

From the foregoing investigations, I think it is deducible that neither digitalis, 
juniper or squill, increases the total amount of solid matter eliminated by the 
kidneys, and that the organic matter is considerably reduced through their in- 
fluence. Although they do increase the amount of inorganic matter removed 
through the urine, yet as it is the organic matter which is generally considered 
as contaminating the blood in disease, it is evident they exert no effect what- 
ever in depurating this fluid, but on the contrary are positively injurious. 
The results obtained, in so far as the experiments with digitalis, squill or 
juniper, are concerned, are similar to those obtained by Krahmer, but are mate- 
rially diS'erent as regards the colchicum. For, although Krahmer found that 
under the influence of this medicine there was an increase in the amount of 
organic matter excreted, this was so small as to lead to the supposition that it 
may have been accidental, and besides there was a reduction in the quantity of 
inorganic substance removed. It is desirable, therefore, that we should have 
farther observations with this article. 
The alterations in the Constitution, proposed by Dr. Hammond, were read for 
the third time and adopted. 
Article 1st of the Constitution, as so altered, will read as follows : 
L Every resident member shall pay an initiation fee of two dollars. 
Article 2d, will read as follows :

until he shall have paid the fee of initiation, &c.

On the Inhalation of Cinchonia, and its salts. 
BY S. W. MITCHELL, M. D. 
There can be very little donbt that at some future time we shall possess 
the means of giving to patients many potent remedies in the form of inhala- 
tion, rather than in the usual way. This is at least among the hopes of the 
therapeutist of the present day. Absorption of medicinal substances by the 
intestinal mucous surface is but too often uncertain, while the passage to the 
blood through the lungs seems to be always an open track when the agent in- 
haled is in a state of vapor. How desirable it would be to possess the means 
of inhaling quinine in the congestive fevers of our malarious districts, we can 
very well conceive. Gruided by these ideas, I have sought industriously for 
some means of attaining this result, and although I have failed, as I shall 
here show, in evolving any very marked practical benefit from these researches, 
I have met with certain facts of such interest that I desire to put them on 
record as indicating a novel direction for medical thought and action. 
At one time, the analogy in chemical composition, between certain of the 
newly formed ethers and quinia itself, seemed to point out these as fit sub- 
jects for therapeutic use and trial. The difficulty of procuring them, obliged me, 
however, to relinquish effort in this direction, and I turned from them to exam- 
ine anew the alkaloids derived from cinchona bark. While thus engaged, one of 
my friends, now Dr. Bill, of the army, pointed out to me in Fresenius's Che- 
mistry, his account of cinchonia, which he describes as volatile at high tem- 
peratures. 
Struck with this, I searched carefully for any accounts of its inhalation, but 
as yet have been unable to find in the books on Cinchona any description of 
inhalation, as a mode of using the alkaloid in question. The last complete 
work on quinia, by M. Briquet, enumerates many methods of employing the 
alkaloids and bark, but neither among the means in use, or out of use, is this 
one alluded to. Occasionally, in disease of the lungs or throat, inhalation of 
pulverized cinchona bark has been resorted to, and M. Briquet relates, â 
"Traite Therapeutique du Quinquina et de ses preparations," p. 118, â that 
those who work in the storehouses of cinchona bark are sometimes thus cured 
of malarious fevers. This could only occur through accidental ingestion, and 
inhalation of thÂ« floating particles of bark. 
Cinchonia and its salts are the only alkaloids which appear to be volatile 
by heat. After many experiments, I have finally resorted to the following 
very simple method of inhaling them : â About forty grains of pure cinchonia, 
being mixed up with sand, are placed in a capsule, and heated by a spirit- - 
lamp. The sand is useful in diffusing the heat, and preventing too rapid a 
destruction of the alkaloid. A heat of about 300Â° melts the particles of cin>- 
chonia into a brown fluid, and from this, if the evaporation be carefully ma- 
naged, the volatilized alkaloid escapes in the form of a gray vapor* 
When a microscope glass is held over the capsule, and the heat is too ele- 
vated, the cinchonia decomposes, and a dark red gummy-matter, with the 
odor of burned benzoin, adheres to the glass. A rather lower temperature 
drives off the cinchonia in a gray vapor, which may be made to redeposit the â  
pure alkaloid upon the interior of a funnel held over it, or upon a microscope 
slide. The alkaloid thus obtained is in branching needles. 
On a number of occasions, I inhaled the vapors of cinchonia, often breath- 
ing them for ten or twenty minutes, without much inconvenience, when caro

was taken to regulate the supply of heat. The brown or reddish volatile sub- 
stance which is given off when the heat used is too great, so irritates the 
throat as to cause nausea, and oblige the patient to cease inhaling. 
When carefully inhaled, a part of the alkaloid is deposited on the throat 
and in the mouth, where its sub-bitter taste is soon perceived. To guard 
against error, which might arise from swallowing these portions of the alka- 
loid, I refrained from swallowing whilst inhaling, and frequently rinsed the 
throat with water. 
Upon four occasions, I noted the symptoms caused by the cinchonia thus 
employed, taking care to allow the excitement of the system produced by the 
inhalation to pass away before I counted the pulse. In three instances the 
pulse fell, losing from 6 to 10 beats per minute. In the fourth, the pulse re- 
mained a few beats above the normal number. The person on whom these 
experiments were made is liable to still greater depression of cardrac energy, 
when under the influence of quinia. At first, it was difficult to separate the 
ordinary signs of cinchonism, from the feelings of cerebral confusion, caused 
by breathing too rapidly. These sensations, however, were evanescent. At 
the end of a quarter of an hour, or even less, the head was clear, and within 
half an hour afterwards the patient felt a quickly increasing headache, with 
giddiness, and sometimes a feeling as though the brain was swelling into 
monstrous bulk. These sensations passed away within four or five hours, un- 
less the inhalation was renewed. 
Still uncertain as to whether or not the alkaloid entered the blood, I 
caused a healthy adult, aet. twenty-nine years, to inhale the fumes from forty 
grains of the heated cinchonia four times in one day. Symptoms of cincho- 
nism were felt only after the first inhalation, which was made at 10 A. M.; 
at 12 M. the second inhalation took place, and at the same time four ounces 
of clear urine, s. g. 1023, were passed. The other inhalations occurred in 
the afternoon and evening, but none other of the urine passed was saved, 
until 7 A. M. next day. 
The first specimen was examined by Bouchardat's test, the iodated iodide of 
potassium. This reagent gave a faint but decisive brown precipitate of iodide 
of cinchonia, when employed in the usual way ; when, however, I placed 
in a test tube a portion of the test solution, and slowly poured upon it the 
lighter wine, a profuse deposit of the iodide announced the presence of cin- 
chonia in the urine. In the usual mode of making this test, â although the 
precipitate is perceptible enough, â it almost immediately redissolves in the 
urine, which appears to possess a remarkable power of dissolving the iodides of 
cinchonia and quinia, since when these precipitates are thrown down from an 
aqueous solution of a salt of either alkaloid, they are found to be very insolu- 
ble. The second specimen of urine contained only traces of cinchonia, and 
twenty-four hours after the last inhalation no evidence of the presence of the 
alkaloid in the urine could in any way be obtained. 
It will be readily seen from what I have said, that I do not anticipate any 
remarkably valuable practical results from the new mode of administering 
cinchonia, in vapor. The want of therapeutic power in this alkaloid, when 
compared with quinia, â dose for dose, â the difficulty of regulating the heat 
so as to volatilize, and yet not decompose it, as well as the unpleasantness of 
the process of inhalation, combine to deprive these experiments of any great 
practical utility. In a single case of tertian intermittent fever, I employed 
the inhalation of cinchonia vapor. The patient had no new attack for one 
month, although no other ulterior measures were employed. The case was a 
very irregular and uncertain one, and I therefore attach but little faith to this 
single therapeutic test. I should add that my patient complained a good deal 
of the effect of the alkaloid upon his glottis and larynx. For a time it al- 
tered the tones of his voice very considerably. 
In two cases of chronic bronchitis, of long standing, I also used the fumes

of cinclioiiia ; one of these dated his first improvement from the use of these 
inhalations, in which he persisted every other day, for more than two weeks ; 
no other treatment was used until he had been much aided by the means 
above described. He learned after a time to employ the cinchonia without 
my aid. The other patient submitted to one inhalation, but declined any 
further proceedings of a similar character, declaring, that the remedy was 
worse than the disease, only shorter. When we are successful in volatilizing the 
alkaloid without decomposition, the process of inhalation is not very disa- 
greeable ; but when the heat is too high, and the cinchonia becomes altered, 
it is extremely difficult to continue to breathe it. 
The salts of cinchonia are also volatile by heat, but they offer no advan- 
tages which do not equally belong to pure cinchonia. The sulphate is quite 
inadmissible for inhalation use, since sulphuretted gases are given off in small 
amounts when the heat is too elevated, and decomposition takes place. 
Dr. Woodward read a paper entitled ' ' Remarks on the Anatomical Marks of 
Cancer." The Standing Committe-e on Pathology, to which this paper was re- 
ferred, reported in favor of its publication in a medical journal to be selected 
by the author.* 
Dr. Mitchell submitted a short preliminary report on the subject of the 
changes undergone by the white race in America. The object of this report 
was, principally, to suggest the proper manner of proceeding in this research. 
A form of letters to be addressed to different eligible persons, for the purpose 
of receiving their assistance in making this report, was communicated, with a 
copy of the table they are desired to fill. 
The Committee appointed at a former meeting to prep-^re a series of tables for 
the Registration of Diseases, &c., to be used by members of the Department and 
others, reported that they had performed their duty by adopting the tables 
submitted to the State Medical Society by Dr. H. Haetshorne, and approved 
by that Association. Owing to want of funds these tables never were pub- 
lished. Mr. Price, of this city, is willing to issue these tables in book form 
at his own expense, and to supply members and others at a slight cost. 
They will be bound with his visiting list for physicians, and also issued separate- 
ly. The Committee asked leave to print the approval of the Department, 
with these tables, and in its name to recommend them to the profession. 
This report was accepted, and the permission asked was granted. 
Dr. Woodward submitted the following resolutions, which were adopted : 
1. Resolved, That every author of a paper hereafter read before the Depart- 
ment, not designed for publication in the Proceedings, shall at the time of 
reading furnish a full abstract of the same to the Recorder, in order that it 
may be laid before the Academy with the monthly report. 
2. Resolved, That Committees having referred to them papers read before 
the Department, accompanied with illustrations, shall be required to report to 
the Department whether such illustrations are indispensably necessary for 
the thorough elucidation of the subject considered; and when in their opinion 
such a necessity exists, the entire cost of such cuts, engravings or lithographs 
shall be borne by the Department, on a vote of the majority of the members 
present at any stated meeting. Provided, that the author shall present at the 
time an estimate of the cost of such illustrations. 
Dec. 6th. â Dr. Walter F. Atleb read the following communication upoa 
Relaxation of the Abdominal Walls, as a cause of Ilcemorrhoids.^^ 
A cause of haBmorrhoids, at least what we believe may be one, which has 
been neglected by all writers with whom we are acquainted, is weakness or relaxa- 
tion of the muscles of the anterior wall of the abdomen.

[Biolog. 
la order to understand this it is necessary to reflect a little while npon 
the peculiarities of the venous circulation in the portal system. From the 
resistance the blood in the general circulation encounters in traversing the 
capillaries, much of its moving force is lost, and to move regularly in the veins it 
requires some assistance, that is obtained chiefly from muscular movements and 
the aspiratory action of the movements of inspiration ; by neither of these is 
the flow in the portal reins affected. Besides, the portal veins possess no valves, 
and the blood contained therein is between two systems of capillaries, for these 
veins act as arteries in the liver, and the blood passes through a capillary net- 
work in that organ before it empties into the inferior vena cava. If in passing 
through ihe general capillary system, the blood loses nearly the whole of its 
moving force, it is evident that the capillary system in the liver must act in 
the same way, and with so much the more power, as that the tension of the 
blood in the portal vein is already itself less than ihat in the arteries. lu fact, 
well-known experiments, as for instance those made when the blood of the liver 
and that of the portal veins are collected for chemical examination, show that 
the circulation in the vena portarum is an entirely passive one, its current is di- 
rected towards the liver only on the one condition that there is a force to push 
it there, and this force comes from the abdominal walls, which, by pressing the 
mass of the intestines, propel the blood contained therein. Causes that may 
locally modify the circulation must, of course, act here with great efficacy, and 
it is far from being a matter of surprise that the haemorrhoidal veins, those 
most exposed, are often enlarged and diseased. Nature, as usual, has made 
provision for their protection, and were it not for the relief afforded them by 
the communications existing in the walls of the rectum between the inferior 
mesenteric vein, and the middle and hemorrhoidal branchesof the hypogastric, 
they would be still more often aflFected. 
It is very hard to say how far the rapidity of the current of the blood in the 
portal vein may be diminished, but one experiment is sufficient to show the in- 
fluence, in this respect, of causes constantly occurring. The ferro-cyanuret of 
potassium shows itself in the urine as soon as it reaches the general circula- 
tion ; this salt, when given 24 minutes after a meal appeared in the urine at 
the expiration of 16 minutes ; and when given 240 minutes after a meal, in 2 
minutes. In fact when the fatal consequences of the sudden injection into the 
general venous system of large quantities of even the most innocuous fluids is 
considered, the necessity of the prevention of the sudden passage into the infe- 
rior vena cava of the materials carried into the vena portarum, is at once ap- 
parent. Most important chemical changes undoubtedly occur in the liver, but 
it might be shown, we think, by reasons taken from numbers of facts in normal 
and pathological anatomy, both human and comparative, as also in physiology, 
that its action as a mechanical agent is most important. If a few ounces of water 
suddenly thrown into the general circulation of a dog can produce death, what 
would be the effect if, in man, the liver did not intervene between the inferior 
vena cava, and a barrel of lager beer? 
Now it being undoubtedly a fact that the pressure exerted by the abdom- 
inal muscles upon the mass of intestines is the cause of the onward movement 
of the blood in the portal veins towards the liver, any cause diminishing the 
pressure, whether position of the body, or feebleness of the muscles themselves, 
must lead to more or less stagnation of the blood, and cousequently to hemor- 
rhoidal affections. Tailors, shoemakers, dress-makers, and persons engaged in 
writing, which forces them to lean forward over a desk, are particularly sub- 
ject to haBmorrhoids ; and we would explain the well-known influence of seden- 
tary occupations generally upon this affection more by their producing relaxa- 
tion of the anterior abdominal walls, than by the deficiency of exercise and the 
constipation attending them, though these must play their part also. An un- 
doubted cause of an attack of haemorrhoids, and one not unfrequently witnessed, 
is parturition. It is not very uncommon for the patient to suffer most severely

after the birth of the child, from the strangulation of a mass of baemorrhoidal 
veins, that have been forced out with the first passages from the bowels, and the 
cause of this phenomena we believe to be the relaxation of the abdominal walls 
at that time existing. Many facts corroborative of this opinion could readily 
be cited. 
Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to the stomach of a mink {Mus- 
tela vison), containing a large number of worms. The latter had caused much 
thickening of the walls of the stomach, in which the anterior extremity of their 
body deeply penetrated. The worm is a species, heretofore unnoticed, of the 
genus Cheir acanthus. Its name and characters were given as follows : 
Cheiracanthus socialis, Leidy. Body cylindrical, posteriorly obtuse ; anus 
subterminal. Integument transparent, with distinct circular muscles. Head 
discrete, discoidal, furnished with transverse rows of recurved hooks. Mouth 
bilabiate ; oesophagus clavate, red ; intestine dusky brown. Ovaries and ovi- 
ducts, or testes and vasa deferentia, very tortuous and white. Anterior portion 
of the body thickly covered with alternating transverse rows of minute plates, 
of which those most anterior are tridentate, the succeeding ones bidentate, and 
the last ones are simple and gradually become obsolete. Posterior extremity of 
the male attenuated, spirally contorted, and ending in a horse-shoe-like border 
with four red papillae on each side. 
Length of female fifteen lines ; breadth three-fourths of a line ; length of male 
twelve lines, breadth half a line. 
Dr. Woodward stated that a portion of the stomach of the mink was submit- 
ted to him for investigation by Dr. Leidy. The piece presented on the sur- 
face of the mucous membrane several orifices about ^th of an inch in diame- 
ter, which were surrounded by well-marked indurations of the size of a chest- 
nut. On making sections of these indurations it was observed that the orifices 
were the openings of canals penetrating from |- to | of an inch into the tissue, 
winding in various directions ; one orifice sometimes leading to several canals. 
The canals were lined by a reddish pultaceous matter in which blood corpus- 
cles in various stages of disintegration and numerous pus-corpuscles were 
clearly made out. One or two bodies supposed to be ova were also perceived. 
The induration was essentially a new formation of connective tissue in which 
development had proceeded to the stage of nucleated caudate cells with ex- 
tremities much prolonged. It involved the sub-mucous tissue and the superfi- 
cial portion of the muscular coat. 
It is presumed that the new formation is the result of the organization of an 
inflammatory exudation, poured out as the consequence of the disturbance pro- 
duced by the penetration of the worm into the tissue. 
Dk. Mitchell exliibited an ingenious injecting pump, invented by Mr. 
Franklin Peale, of this city. Its valves were in imitation of those in the 
reins of the animal organism. He also exhibited a craniometer, graduated to 
l-50th of an inch, and a spirometer, for measuring lung capacity, much su- 
perior to the one ordinarily used. 
While engaged recently, in preparing various instruments to be used in phy- 
sical examinations of the height, weight, and pulmonary capacity of the men of 
the police force of Philadelphia, Dr. M. was struck with the clumsiness, and, 
in some instances, with the inefficiency of the ordinary spirometer. Its great 
size and cumbrous form, the necessity of using many buckets of water to fill 
it, and the expense of its construction, alike unfit it for common or ready 
use. 
With the aid of his friend, Mr. B. Phillips, and of Mr. Gratz, he has suc- 
ceeded in arranging the ordinary " dry gas metre" so as to adapt it perfectly 
to spirometric use. This beautiful metre is made in vast numbers by Messrs. 
Code, Hopper & Co., of Philadelphia. It is unnecessary to explain the interior

arrangements, which, although complicated, are capable of accurately measur- 
ing the cubic amount of the gases which pass through, and it is so little apt 
to become deranged that it will often run for years without serious error. As 
the works of the dry metre are made by machinery, and the number manu- 
factured is enormous, the price is of necessity moderate, being from eight to 
ten dollars, or less than one half of the cost of the worst spirometer, made 
upon the ordinary plan, and many times less than that of the best of them. 
This new form of spirometer runs with so little friction that a pressure of l-8th 
of an inch of water will move it readily. One source of error is thus avoided, 
since if the instrument was difficult to move, the air blown into it would be 
more or less condensed, and so occupy less space than it ought to do. 
The number of cubic inches passed through this instrument is marked by 
hands upon a dial placed on top of the metre. After very careful testing, it 
was found to give extremely accurate indications. The size of the new spi- 
rometer is as follows : â Height 14 inches, width 11 inches. The inlet and 
outlet pipes form convenient handles. 
As the air from the lungs naturally deposits a certain amount of moisture 
in the metre, its escape is provided for by an aperture at the bottom, usually 
closed by a button. 
The committee to which was referred the Preliminary Report of Dr. S. Wiee 
Mitchell, relative to the plan by which he purposes obtaining the statistics of 
height, weight, &c., of the native born white race in North America, reported 
that upon full and attentive consideration it was the opinion of the com- 
mittee that the plan proposed by Dr. Mitchell, is such, that if followed out as 
indicated by him, it cannot fail to lead to results of the highest importance, 
not only in regard to the development and hygiene of the race in America, but 
to the solution of certain questions relative to mankind at large, of equal if 
not of greater consequence. The committee therefore suggested to the 
Department as a whole, and also to the individual members, the importance of 
aflording to Dr. Mitchell, and to those gentlemen whom he may associate with 
him in his inquiries, such assistance as may be in their power. 
This'committee had also referred to it resolutions giving authority to Dr. M. 
to use the name of the Department in his efforts to obtain the information he 
desires, and appropriating a sum not exceeding sixty dollars for the necessary 
expenses of his investigations. 
The first and second resolutions are so manifestly proper, that the committee 
deemed it unnecessary to urge them further. 
In relation to the third resolution, the committee desired to ofi'er a few rea- 
sons why it should be favorably considered and acted upon by the Depart- 
ment. 
In the first place the subject to which Dr. M.'s inquiries relate, is one assigned 
to him in the report of the General Committee, and therefore not selected by 
him for voluntary investigation. There is accordingly an obvious propriety, 
aside from any other reason, in the Department defraying such necessary and 
moderate expenses as may be incurred. 
2d. In order to do full justice to the subject it is essential that numerous 
circulars, blanks, &c., should be printed and distributed, and that occasionally 
small sums of money should be given to persons who may have rendered valu- 
able assistance. These are expenses probably not incidental to any other sub- 
ject proposed by the Greneral Committee, and it would be just as proper that 
the Recorder should be at the expense of the blanks, circulars, &c., used by 
him for the Department as that Dr. M. should furnish those required for the 
performance of the duty assigned to him. 
Such necessary apparatus as may be required should also be furnished by 
the Department. This will of course remain the property of the Department, 
and may be used in future researches.

3d. In conclusion, the committee was of the opinion that in general no better 
use can be made of the funds of the Department, than by employing them in 
furtherance of such scientific investigations as come within its range of action. 
It is desirable that this should from the first be made the settled principle of 
the Department, and the committee believed that means will not be wanting 
to carry it out. 
The committee therefore recommended the adoption of the third resolution, 
leaving it to the Department to decide whether the amount shall be raised by 
subscription or appropriated directly from the treasury. 
On motion of Dr. Hammond, the Department made the following resolu- 
tions : â 
Resolved, That Dr. M, be appointed a committee of one on the subject of the 
physical development of the native born white American race, with power to 
add to the committee such persons as he may think proper. 
Resolved, That said committee be authorized to make use of the name of the 
Department in its inquiries. 
Resolved, That said committee be authorized to draw upon the Treasurer for 
such funds as may be required, not exceeding sixty dollars. 
On motion of De. Hammond, it was resolved that a Committee be appointed 
to solicit subscriptions, to be paid over to the Treasurer in aid of the investiga- 
tion, in regard to the statistics of the human race in America. 
Mr. FouLKE, a Member of the Committee on Dr. Hartshorne's paper on the 
relations of Physiology to Palaeontology, stated that before the action of the 
committee, the author was compelled to go to Europe for his health, and he 
preferred to withdraw his paper. Mr. Foulke, therefore, at his request, asked 
leave for the withdrawal of the paper, which was granted by the Depart- 
ment. 
Dr. E. Hartshorne presented a resolution, asking for the appointment of a 
committtee, consisting of five persons, to devise and report upon a plan for 
securing a wide circulation of the memoirs of the Department among medical 
readers. The resolution was adopted, and a committee, consisting of Messrs. 
E. Hartshorne, Hammond, Leidy, Mitchell and Atlee was appointed. 
The following persons were chosen as the officers and members of the Stand- 
ing Committees for the ensuing year : 
Director. â Dr. Leidy.

Dr. Mitchell's experiments seem to him to justify the following conclu- 
sions : â 
1st. That the hearts of the frog and turtle heat much less rapidly in vacuo, 
and sometimes cease to act until the air is readmitted. That the vacuum 
most probably retards the heart's action by the mechanical effects it induces, 
as well as by depriving it of oxygen, since the beat in vacuo is long and la- 
bored, and the accelerating influence of the readmitted atmosphere is almost 
instantaneous. 
2d. That mere isolation from the air, as by placing the heart in oil, does 
not alter the rate of the heart's movements for some time, but lessens their 
ultimate duration. 
3d. That water, at serial temperatures, stimulates the heart, and very soon 
causes it to cease to pulsate. That water at higher temperatures, as 100Â° F., â 
113Â° F., produces much more rapidly the same results. 
4th. That glycerine, at serial temperatures, affects the heart but little, except 
as shortening the time during which it continues to pulsate. That glycerine 
at 32Â° F., depresses the heart's action, lessening the number of pulses per 
minute at least one half, and soon checking its movements altogether. That 
olive oil at 32S F., affected the heart very little at first, as to the number of 
beats per minute, but soon rendered them feeble, and finally stopped them ; 
though at the close of a longer interval than was required by glycerine at the 
same temperature.* 
5th. That when the heart has ceased to respond to one stimulus, however 
violent, it will usually remain sensitive to others, apparently far less power- 
ful. 
Dr. Leidy exhibited specimens of true bone, found in the kidney of a mink. 
It was situated in the fibrous tissue of the organ, the glandular substance 
of which was wasted away, its place being occupied by an enormous parasite, 
the Strongylus gigas. 
I5r. Woodward stated that he had found tubercular deposits upon the pleura 
of an opossum, which had been kept in confinement in the Academy for 
some time. 
Dr. Hartshorne, from the Committee appointed to devise and report upon 
a plan for securing a wide circulation of the Memoirs of the Department among 
medical readers, reported certain resolutions, which were read for the first 
time. 
This Report was adopted. 
A resolution was offered by Dr. Hartshorne, providing for the appointment 
of a Committee on Statistics, which was adopted. 
The following persons were duly elected members of the Biological Depart-

* The glycerine was thinner than the English Glycerine, (Prick's), now in use, and 
altogether was a much less reliable article. For this reason I do not entirely trust the

THE 
MOSAIC ACCOUNT OF THE CREATION. 
Tiie substance of the following paper was originally given as a verbal com- 
munication, at the meeting of the Academy of Natural Sciences, on the 9tli 
of May, 1854, in reply to the strictures of W. Parker Foulke, Esq., on the lec- 
ture of the late Hugh Miller, ' ' The two Records â the Mosaic and the Geologic. ' ' 
It was the design of the Author to show, that Mr. Miller, so far from using the 
classification by geologists, of the rocks on the earth's surface into three great 
groups, the ^^palceozoic, secondary, and tertiary,''^ to illustrate the striking coin- 
cidence between the two records, in an unauthorized manner, was perfectly 
Justified in showing that this classification, inade without any reference to the 
Scriptures whatever, yet, did, in a most wonderful manner, agree with them. He 
endeavored to show that by taking the most prominent fact in each of these 
periods, Mr. Miller had only followed the course which Moses had taken with 
each of the other, so-called, days. He had not stated, and did not intend to 
state, that these were the only facts, but that in each of them they were the 
most prominent and characteristic. Circumstances at the time prevented the au- 
thor from Avriting out his remarks, for publication with those of Mr. Foulke, 
and no good opportunity occurred until the present summer, when they were 
published in the form now given, in the Presbyterian Quarterly Review. It 
has been a source of regret to the author, that they were not published at the 
time, as they would probably have saved the lamented Miller from the feeling 
expressed in the notes to his last work, "The Testimony of the Rocks," iu 
regard to the remarks made by Mr. Foulke, which were certainly made in no 
unkind spirit towards Mr, M., for any such feeling was at the time most ex- 
j)licitly disclaimed. 
The various methods by which theologians and geologists have sought to 
reconcile "the testimony of the rocks," and our version of the first chapter 
of Genesis, may all be reduced to two, or perhaps, three general schemes. 
The first one supposes, that between the first verse and the second there was 
an undefined and enormous interval of time, in which the various geological 
changes, such as we now find upon the earth, took place ; that the earth was 
then brought into the chaotic state described in the second verse, and then it 
was, in six days of twenty-four hours each, prepared for the habitation of 
man, who was at that time placed upon it. This was the plan of reconciliation 
Oi Dr. Chalmers, and, with a single exception, that of Dr. John Pye Smith, who 
thought that the chaos described in the second verse, and the work of creation, 
in the rest of the chapter, extended over but a small part of the earth's sur- 
face, and that outside of that area, the rest of the earth continued to enjoy 
the light of the sun, and plants and animals lived, and grew, and have con- 
tinued by an unbroken series of generations to our own times. The progress 
of geological discovery has caused the scheme of Dr. Chalmers to be laid aside, 
for it does not meet the wants of the case, and that of Dr. Smith is opposed 
to the record of Moses, in making no provision for the creation of the heavens. 
The second method supposes, that the days were periods of great and indefi- 
nite extent, each embracing vast ages, in which the various geological changes 

4 
occurred. With some few modifications, this is now adopted by the great ma- 
jority of modern geologists. There is little, if any, doubt that so far at least 
as the length of the days is concerned, this scheme is strictly in consonance 
with the meaning of the Scriptures. Almost all geologists and theologians, 
however, commit the mistake of confining this description of the creation to 
the earth alone, although the sacred narrative as plainly asserts that " in the 
beginning God created the heavens and the earth," and at its close declares, 
"thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them." 
Prof. Barrows, in commenting upon this verse says, that " Tuch remarks, 
that this is the only passage in which the word hosts includes earthly objects 
along with the heavenly host. It denotes the orderly marshalling and ar- 
ranging of all created things in heaven and earth." We have a right then to 
require that any system of interpretation which shall be presented to us for 
adoption, shall account for the heavenly bodies, as well as the earth, and it 
will not do, as we shall soon see, to confine the sole description of their creation 
to the work of the fourth day. Such an interpretation must not only accord with 
geology, but likewise with astronomy. It must, in short, be so read as to give 
us an account of the creation of the heavens, as well as of the earth. 
Before proceeding to examine and determine the meaning of the Mosaic re- 
cord, we may premise, that that interpretation which, fairly made, according 
to those rules by which we interpret all language, shall best harmonize with 
all the facts, is most likely to be the true one, even though it may be very 
different from the one which we have been accustomed to regard as correct. 
If it best agrees with all the phenomena, we ought not to reject it on account 
of novelty, and assume that it cannot be true, because so many learned and 
wise scholars, on whose opinions we have been accustomed to rely, have given 
a different reading. It may be, that they have never examined it from the 
right point of view, to attain the knowledge of its meaning. 
We will now proceed with our undertaking. Verse 1st. " In the beginning 
(rod created the heavens and the earth." Prof. Lewis has employed a large 
part of the sixth chapter of his Six Days of Creation, in proving that the word 
translated create, does not mean to bring into existence from nothing, but ra- 
ther to arrange matter previously existing. It seems, however, more reasona- 
])le to think that it was the design of Moses, to teach, in opposition to those 
who believed in and taught the eternity of matter, that it was created by the 
power of God. In fact, the absolutely literal translation of the verse conveys 
exactly this idea. 
In our version, the particle which means the substance of, is not trans- 
lated ; were it rendered, the verse would read thus : "In the beginning God 
created the substance of the heavens and the earth. ' ' The authorities for this 
reading are many and important. Dr. Wilson, in his Easy Introduction to 
the Knowledge of Hebrew without the Points, in a note on this word says, 
' ' This i>article following an active verb, and going before a noun which has 
the servile ,1 prefixed, admits of no translation unless we render it ' the sub- 
stance of.' Here the sense will allow it, which is rarely the case." So Har- 
ris, in his Pre-Adamite Earth, in a note on this first verse, says, "according 
to the Rabbins, the verse should be rendered, ' God in the beginning created 
the substance of the heavens and the substance of the earth.' They under- 
stand J^t^ hereto mean the substance or material. The Syriac translation 
gives the same sense. Compare Gesenius on this word ; Aben Ezra ; Kimchi 
in his Book of Roots, and Buxtorf's Talmudic Lexicon." 
The adoption of this reading throws light upon the subsequent verse, and 
assists us to understand more clearly its meaning. 
Verse 2d. "And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was 
upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the 
waters." 
"It has been held that the particle translated and in this verse, does not 
necessarily imply a direct connection between this verse and the first, and that 
an immense period of time may have elapsed between them. Barrows and 
others, have, however, shown conclusively that this is erroneous, and that it 

5 
lias here its proper power as a direct copulative. This is also evident from 
the verse itself. What is the object of this verse ? Is it not to describe the 
condition or state of the substance of the heavens and the earth, the creation 
of which has just been affirmed ? Prof. Lewis says, ' ' ' without form and void ' 
are expressions, the one referring to utter irregularity of dimensions, and out- 
ward extent, the other to the deficiency of gravity ; denoting, not so much an 
absolute as a relative want of weight, in other words, a fluid or rarified condi- 
tion, with an absence of all cohesion or solidity, or it may be a huge nebulosi- 
ty," &c. ; and again, "the QinD ^^ep is evidently the ^jHri' ^'^i^^otif 
form, mentioned before. It is etymologically different, and yet the word as 
here used, can be only another name for the chaos, though afterwards em- 
ployed to denote other objects which the imagination might regard as present- 
ing some resemblance to the primeval waste." The word waters, in this verse, 
is also used to designate the same as the deep. We would here also remark 
that the word j^^n^iO' i"eiiclered moved upon, is in the Hiphil conjugation, 
and is therefore causative, and would be more properly rendered caused motion 
yn. The phrase the face of, is idiomatical and answers to our word throughout. 
We ca,n now understand the meaning of the verse. Moses is describing, in his 
masterly manner, by a few bold expressions, the appearance of the matter of 
whose creation he had just spoken. It was formless and void, or filling all 
space and without any cohesion or solidity ; it was all dark ; and a motion 
caused by the Spirit of God pervaded it. The Creator now proceeds to form 
this formless and void matter into those bodies which he had from eternity 
designed. The first act was the endowing a part of this dark matter with lu- 
minous properties. Verse 3d. ''And Grod said, let there be light, and there 
was light." The language used does not imply a new creation of matter, but 
simply giving to matter already created luminous power. 
Verse 4th. "And Grod saw the light that it was good, and God divided be- 
tween the light and the darkness." The expression, God saw that it was good, 
does not imply moral goodness, but that it was fitted for the designed end, the 
purpose for which he formed it. This remark applies also to each place in the 
chapter in which the expression occurs. The word here rendered divided, ex- 
presses a gradual act, such as the separation of two dissimilar substances 
would be ; how this separation was finally effected we shall presently see. 
Verse 5th. "And God called the light day, and the darkness he called 
night ; and the evening and the morning were the first day," or literally, 
"evening was, morning was, one day." The name day is here used evidently 
in a different sense, in the first part of the verse, from what it is in the last. 
In the first part, it undoubtedly is a name given to the light to designate its 
special character. Gesenius and others derive it from a root, which signifies 
to be warm, hot, to glow with heat, and therefore its signification as a name 
will be, that which produces heat, or the warmth-producer ; a name which 
fairly expresses its principal character, and is in this respect like our word 
caloric, with which it seems to be identical in meaning ; so also the term night 
is here used, not to designate a portion of time, but as the name of the dark, 
or non-luminous matter from which the luminous had been, in this work of 
the first day, separated. It is, says Wilson, derived from the root 7^7, sig- 
nifying to turn to, or towards, to move around, and as a name would be, the 
moving around matter. 
In the latter part of the verse, the term day means a period of time. Tlie 
trae meaning of this word here, has been one of the chief difficulties in the 
way of the interpretation of this chapter. Many have contended that it means 
in this place, a period of twenty-four hours, or what we call a natural day, 
and their main argument has been the reference to the work of creation in the 
fourth commandment. They contend that God, in the reason which is there- 
given for hallowing the seventh day, settles this point, that the days of crea- 
tion were natural days. Now, there is no fact more evident than that the word 
day is used in the Scriptures in a variety of senses, one of which we have in.. 

6 
the first part of this verse, where it certainlj has no reference whatever to 
time or duration. When it does mean duration or time, it is by no means re- 
stricted to the meaning contqpded for ; on the contrary it has so many different 
ones, that we can only determine it from the context. The instances of these 
are numerous. In the next chapter we are told in the fourth verse, " these are 
the generations of the heavens and the earth, â in the day that the Lord Grod 
made the earth and the heavens." Here the term day includes the whole six 
days of the creation. So, when Job says, " turn from him that he may accom- 
plish, as an hireling, his day," he uses it to express the lifetime of a man. 
When our Saviour said to the Jews, "Abraham rejoiced to see my day," he 
used it to designate the period of his appearance upon earth. We have also 
the prophetic use of the word for a year, and many other uses of the same 
character, so that we can only determine the meaning of the word from the 
context. Prof. Lewis says, "the Hebrews use the word day, for any pe- 
riod of time, presenting a complete course or unity of events, irrespective of 
precise duration. There can be no doubt at all of such usage." We would 
I i"eply to the argument for the limitation of time in the fourth commandment, 
that we are told in the next chapter, that God rested from his work on the 
seventh day, and blessed the seventh day and sanctified it. Now we wish those 
who contend for this limitation of the six days, to tell us when the seventh day 
ended, and when God ceased to rest from his work. The term Sabbath is also 
used to signify a rest of more than a natural day. It is so used in the 
Levitical law to designate the Sabbath of the land, or every seventh year, and 
in other places. The meaning of the word day is unquestionably limited by 
the context, and in each subsequent passage to the series of completed events 
with which it is connected. Here the context limits it to the period from the 
creation of matter to the separation of light matter from the dark matter ; and 
â¢ as no sun was yet in existence, it could not have been a day measured by it. 
Verses 6th, 7th, and 8th. " And God said let there be a firmament in the 
midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God 
made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament, 
from the waters which were above the firmament, and it was so. And God 
called the firmament, heaven : and the evening and the morning were the sec- 
ond day." There is no part of the account of the creation that has more puz- 
zled commentators. 
Perhaps it is not possible to find any exposition of this work of the second 
day, that has yet been given, that when fairly examined does not involve a 
downright absurdity. We will mention two examples of these ; one given by 
Cruden, the author of the Concordance, as the understanding of divines in re- 
gard to it in the year 1737, and the other by Prof. Barrows, of Andover, in 
the year 1856. "The word used," says Cruden, "is y'p"!? which is trans- 
lated expansion, something expanded, or firmament, something firm and 
solid. By this word, the Hebrews understood the heavens, which, like a solid 
and immense arch (though it be soft and liquid) served as a bank and barrier 
between the upper and the lower waters ; and that the stars were set in this 
arch like so many precious stones in gold and silver, when firmament is taken 
for tlie starry heaven ; then by upper waters, is meant that sea or collection 
of waters placed by God above all the visible heavens, and there reserved for 
ends known to himself. If by firmament we understand the air called the 
expansion because it is extended far and wide, and the firmament, because it 
is fixed in its proper place, from whence it cannot be moved unless by force ; 
then by superior waters are to be understood the waters in the clouds ; and 
these may be said to be above the firmament of air, because they are above a 
considerable part of it." 
Prof. Barrows, of Andover, says: "In this azure vault (the sky) God has 
placed the heavenly bodies ; the fowls fly above the earth on its face ; that is, 
along under it, as if skimming its surface, and it constitutes a permanent di- 
vision between the waters above and below itself. The waters under the firma- 
ment are those on the earth's surface. The waters above the firmament are 
not directly the clouds, but rather that invisible store-house of waters whence 

the clouds are, from age to age, supplied. Such seems to be the representation 
of the sacred writer. And now, what is there in this at which modern science 
can justly take offence ? Is it that he describes the firmament as an outspread 
vault, in which are placed the sun, moon, and stars ? Is it that he places an 
inexhaustible reservoir of water above our heads ? That Glod has such a re- 
servoir there, is certain ; for he has been pouring down rain from it for six 
thousand years, and it is not yet spent !" Certainly, this is almost equal to the 
child's idea of the sky ; "A great blue curtain drawn overhead, with holes in 
it to let the glory of heaven through." A very beautiful idea for a child. We 
answer the professor's question seriously, in the words of Hugh Miller â "that 
philology cannot be sound which would commit the Scriptures to a science 
that cannot be true." 
The diificulty arises here from an entire mistake as to the meaning of p'p"n5 
and the waters here mentioned. The word is derived from a root which means 
to expand, to spread abroad, and, as a noun, it may be rendered expansion. 
Now, what is the meaning here of expansion ? Is it not a division of the form- 
less and space-filling mass into difierent parts, and by an interval or expansion 
that can be measured from one to another ? In other words, the matter of the 
universe was now divided into all those parts which, by their consolidation on 
the succeeding day, were to form not only our earth, but all the heavenly bo- 
dies. This gives us an intelligent idea of what the work of the second day 
was. It was the division of the matter formed in the beginning, and on the 
first day divided into two great classes, the light and the dark, into those in- 
numerable parts which were to form the heavens and the heaven of heavens. 
Verses 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th. "And God said. Let the waters 
under the heaven be gathered together into one place, and let the dry appear, 
and it was so ; and Grod called the dry, earth ; and the gathering together of 
the waters called he seas ; and Grod saw that it was good. And Grod said Let 
the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit-tree yielding 
fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth ; and it was so. 
And the earth brought forth grass, and the herb yielding seed after his kind, 
and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed is in itself, after his kind ; and God saw 
that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day." 
The work of the third day was, first ; the consolidation of the matter of the 
universe here designated as "the waters under the heavens." Throughout 
all the regions of space this work of consolidation went on simultaneously. 
Previous to this third day of creation, no geological changes could have taken 
place, for the earth had no separate existence. Now, however, they commence, 
and, as the earth becomes fitted for the existence of life upon it, it is supplied. 
The second part of the work of this day was the clothing the earth with ver- 
dure by the creation of plants in rich abundance ; the operations of this day 
and the fifth are consecutive, for the work of the fourth day extended over a 
part of each of these days. The third, fifth, and sixth days are the only ones 
with which geology has anything to do, and, for the manner in which the two 
records agree, we must refer to the late work of the lamented Miller, The 
Testimony of the Rocks, especially to the lecture â the two Records, Mosaic 
and Geological. 
Verses 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th. "And God said, Let there 
be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night ; 
and let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and for years. And 
let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the 
earth ; and it was so. And God made two great lights ; the greater light to 
rule the day, andthe lesser light to rule the night ; he made the stars also. 
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 
and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the 
darkness ; and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning 
were the fourth day." 
It has puzzled many to know why the sun, moon, and stars were not said 
to be made before the fourth day. If the reader has followed carefully the 
course of interpretation, he can now see why they are not mentioned before. 

8 
The word here rendered made, is not the one which is rendered create, but one 
which most frequently means constituted, appointed, or set in order. The 
work, then, of the fourth day was the ordering and arrangement of the mo- 
tions of the heavenly bodies ; and their functions, so far as our earth is con- 
cerned, are clearly stated. The undoubted object of this was to guard men 
against making them objects of divine worship ; they were created things, the 
work of the Deity ; and, so far as man was concerned, they were designed to 
serve his convenience and promote liis welfare. Let us now recapitulate the 
work of the several days, and see how they agree with the teachings of the 
works of God. 
In the beginning, God created the substance of the heavens and the earth, 
and this substance was without form and void, or, diffused throughout space, 
it was dark, and the Spirit of God caused a motion to commence in it. God 
endued a part of it with luminous properties, and a part he left dark ; he then 
caused the light to separate from the dark matter, and named the light matter 
day, or the warmth-producing matter ; and the dark he called night, or the 
moving-around matter. This constituted the first day. On the second day, 
he caused the matter of the heavens and the earth, or of the universe, to sepa- 
rate and divide into distinct masses ; and to the space, which contained these 
masses, together with the masses themselves, he gave the name of heaven. 
This was the work of the second day. On the third day, he caused the masses 
of matter to become consolidated, and gave to the one which we inhabit, the 
specific name of earth, and to its collections of waters, seas. He then clothed 
the earth abundantly with verdure of all kinds, and commenced its prepara- 
tion for the residence of man upon it ; this was the work of the third day. On 
the fourth day, he arranged the motions of the heavenly bodies, both with 
reference to the earth and to each other. On the fifth and sixth days, the 
preparation of the earth for the residence of man was completed, and man 
was placed upon it. We have thus a clear, definite, and intelligible narrative, 
which agrees throughout with the teachings of the most perfect science. We 
have not space now to review the various phenomena of nature which bear us 
out in the assertion ; but those who have studied the subject will understand 
the full force of the declaration that, if one should seek to give a sketch in the 
fewest words of the Celestial Mechanism of Laplace, the Cosmos of Humboldt, 
and the geology of the latest and best authorities, he would do it in the very 
language of Moses. Here, then, we have presented to us the wonderful spec- 
tacle of all the grandest conclusions of science, epitomized, arranged, and 
accounted for ages ago, at a time when we are accustomed to look upon the 
world as in its infancy, and when all nations, except the one to which this 
wonderful writer belonged, were plunged in the darkest and most degrading 
idolatry. Where did Moses get this knowledge so absolutely perfect ? Was 
it not from God ? and is not this chapter, over which such a premature shout 
of triumph has been sent up, the most convincing proof of the inspiration of 
the Scriptures ? And so it will ever be, no matter what assaults may be made 
upon it, whether it be in regard to the unity of the race, or some other which 
shall yet be brought forward, all will prove in the end vain and futile, and the 
Scriptures will come out of the contest like the three Jews from Nebuchad- 
nezzar's fiery furnace, without even the smell of fire having passed upon 
them. 

Hints to Craniographers. 
BY J. AITKEN MEIGS, M. D. 
Everywhere Ethnology, the youngest and most ambitious of the sciences, is 
at length beginning to receive that earnest attention which the grandeur, im- 
portance and acknowledged complexity of its problems demand. Treated at 
iirst as an eminently speculative and metaphysical study, it has come at lengtli 
to be considered as amenable chiefly, if not entirely, to the purely scientific 
methods of research emploj^ed by the naturalist. Long ago, the Ethnology of 
the so-called philosophical school was simply a meagre Anthropology, made up 
almost wholly of certain national, psychologic phenomena of uncertain value 
and unknown relations. In the metaphysical systems of this school physical 
characters and the working formulae of the naturalist found no place. But the 
attempt to separate the phenomena of mind from the physical conditions with 
which they are constantly associated in nature, proved as barren in results, as 
it was irrational in conception. 
Anterior to the time of Linnaeus the philosopliy oi man was everything, the 
science nothing. Of the latter, the great Swedish naturalist was himself the 
founder and first exponent. After Linnaeus, came BufFon, Daubenton, Camper, 
Soemmering, Blumenbach, Zimmerman, and others, who, by regarding, and 
therefore treating man, as falling legitimately within the scope of the zoological 
method, attracted serious attention to the study of Anthropology as one of the 
natural sciences. The labors of these savants formed the foundation of this 
study, and gave it an impetus which is felt even at the present day. It must 
be confessed, however, that since the days of Blumenbach, in whose hands it 
received its more exact and scientific form, the progress of the study has 
been both slow and irregular; and the facts collected neither so extensive, nor 
for the most part so thoroughly and satisfactorily established as could be 
desired. Buffon, Cuvier, Lawrence, Peron, Kombst, Davis, Wilson and others, 
have all, at different times, taken occasion to deplore and comment upon this 
evident neglect of an important investigation. 
Closely examined, the cause of this manifest neglect, and consequent slow pro- 
gress of the Ethnological branch of Anthropology, will be found to be two-fold. 
In the first place and for a long time, the study of man was by many entirely 
separated from that of the rest of creation. Barbangois, Marcel de Serres, Ray, 
Brisson, Pennant, Vicq d'Azyr, and other naturalists following Aristotle, the 
illustrious founder of philosophical natural history, have all in succession 
ignored the physical character of man, by excluding him in their classification? 
from the animal kingdom. Thus effectually isolated, he has been treated from 
a mental point of view only, and his zoological affinities and analogies com- 
pletely overlooked. Another class of observers, however, having a more com- 
prehensive conception of nature, and the unity of design which pervades it, 
have at length recognised the animality of man, and placed him accordingly 
among, and at the head, of the Mammalia, 
In the second place, the study has thus far been one of divided effort, under- 
taken by individuals who, at different times and in different places, widely 
separated from each other, have worked at and attempted to solve with varying 
success, each his own favorite problem, with little or no aid from, or corres- 
pondence with others interested in, and studying the same specialty. In a 
word, there has been little or no combination, or regularly systemized effort 
among the students of Ethnology. 
Attempts, it is true, have not been wanting to establish such combinations, 
and appeals have been made to the scientific and general public, from time to 
time, by enthusiastic archEeologists and ethnologists, in behalf of some of the 
objects of their respective sciences. As early as 181 7, Dr. HodgkiU; in an Essay 
on the Promotion of Civilization, pointed out the importance of preserving from 
annihilation the uncivilized races of men, that their physical characters, tradi- 
tions, &c., might be carefully studied. In 1837, an Aborm7ies Protection Society 

2 
was formed in England, for the purpose of collecting information " concerning 
the character, habits and wants of the uncivilized tribes." But the benevolent 
objects of the Society finally engrossed the attention of its members to the ex- 
clusion of the ethnological. Two years later, Dr. Prichard, in the unwearied 
pursuit of his favorite study, called the attention of the British Association, then 
in session at Birmingham, to the rapid manner in which certain varieties of the 
human race were hastening on to extinction. He suggested to the Association 
the importance of making some effort to rescue from utter oblivion, the many 
historical, physiological and philological details, constituting, so to speak, the 
biography of these decaying races. His interesting paper, read before the 
Natural Historical Section of the Association, was, in fact, an appeal in behalf 
of Ethnology. This appeal met with a lively response in the appointment of a 
Committee to prepare a set of queries to be addressed to travellers and others 
whose opportunities were such as to enable them to give satisfactory answers 
to these queries. About the same time the Ethnographical Society of Paris, 
published a similar set of questions for travellers. In 1842, Dr. King, of London, 
urged upon the scientific public, the wants and interests of Ethnology, in a 
prospectus issued July 20th, for the formation of an Ethnological Society. In 
1844, after many of the barbarous races had disappeared forever from the face 
of the earth, Drs. King and Hodgkin endeavored in conjunction, '* to excite 
suflQcient interest to command the necessary means for preserving a record of 
the living, and of that which remains of the dead." {Anniversary Address to 
the Ethnological Society of London^ 25th May, 1844.) In 1841 we find the late 
Mr. Geo. R. Gliddon appealing to the Antiquaries of Europe in behalf of the 
monuments of Egypt, which at that time, to use his own language, "were dis- 
appearing with frightful rapidity from the banks of the Nile." (^Otia JEgypiiaca, 
p. 7). In 1852, in a highly interesting pamphlet, entitled " Questions Relatives 
d, I' Mhnologie Ancienne de la France^'''' read before the Society of Antiquaries of 
that country, M. Alfred Maury pressed upon the attention of the correspondents 
of the Society, the necessity of investigating, ere it was too late, the physiog- 
nomical and national characters of the dissimilar races inhabiting the different 
cantons of France; their costumes, usages, linguistic and cognominal peculiari- 
ties, &c. Prichard long ago hoped that specimens of the craniology of Britain 
would not be suffered to fall into decay. In 1855 Mr. A. H. Rhind, actuated 
by the same feeling, sent forth a " vigorous appeal for the preservation of 
the ' monuments of primeval Britain,' " which appeal has found a truly 
scientific and valuable response in the Crania Britannica of Messrs. Davis and 
Thurnam, who are successfully attempting " to rescue and perpetuate the 
faithful lineaments of a sufiicient number of the skulls of the ancient races of 
Britain, to preserve authentic data for the future." Davis strenuously urges 
the importance of studying the diversified races of the British Islands " with 
constant reference to their origin and history, and taking their cranial and 
other physical properties as a basis." 
The human skull is so positively distinctive of race, that it claims at the hands 
of the student of Anthropology the most minute examination. The receptacle of 
the brain, of the organs of the senses and the masticatory apparatus, it exhibits 
race-characters more striking and distinguishing than those presented by any 
other part of the bony system. The pelvis, perhaps, comes next to it in ethno- 
graphic importance. The configuration of the skull influences to a considerable 
extent the characters of the countenance and shape of the features. " Hence, 
our zoological study of man," says Lawrence, writing in 1819, " will be greatly 
assisted by carefully examining genuine specimens of the skulls of different 
nations, which are easily prepared and preserved, maybe conveniently handled 
and surveyed, considered in various points of view and compared to each other." 
Just twenty-one years afterwards, Wilde of Dublin wrote : " It is now uni- 
versally admitted by the first authorities in this science, that to the form and 
character of the head can we alone refer in order to determine the varieties of 

3 
man, either existing or extinct." {Narrative of a Voyage to 3Iadeira^ Teneriffe^ 
and along the shores of the Mediterranean. By R. W. Wilde, Dublin, 1840, vol. 2.) 
Craniography is in truth destined to constitute one, perhaps the most import- 
ant of the corner stones upon which the great edifice of the Natural History of 
Man is to be hereafter erected. To become a sure and solid foundation it must 
be composed of numerous and well-established facts upon which the student 
may unhesitatingly build up, until he can overlook and successfully grapple 
with the higher problems of the science. Like its elder sisters Astronomy, Ge- 
ology and Palaeontology in former times. Ethnology is at present passing through 
what Comte calls the metaphysical or speculative phase of its career. Obscure 
writers and lecturers, impatient of that careful and laborious research which 
leads to correct results, and unacquainted even with what has already been 
done by Blumenbach, Retzius, Morton, Buschke, Davis, Virchow and others, 
are daily bringing disrepute upon the whole study, by unwisely discussing 
questions for the solution of which the data have not yet been developed. That 
these controversialists of an hour may be silenced, and the science positively 
advanced, every effort should be made to multiply and classify facts. But the 
multiplication and classification of facts must in great measure keep pace with 
and be dependent upon the establishment of cranial collections, which consti- 
tute, so to speak, the store-houses of the raw material ready to be elaborated 
into a science. 
These collections and the important studies which they facilitate, are daily 
attracting more and more the attention of scientific men both in Europe and 
America ; and the conviction is constantly gathering strength, that the zealous 
cultivation of Craniography is capable of yielding facts of the highest importance, 
not only in a purely scientific, but also in a political point of view. 
In the " summer of 1830, Dr. S. G. Morton delivered a lecture, introductory 
to a course of anatomy, on the 'different forms of the skull, as exhibited in the 
five races of men.' Strange to say, he could neither buy nor borrow a cranium 
of each of these races ; and he finished his discourse without showing either the 
Mongolian or Malay. Forcibly impressed with this great deficiency in a most 
important branch of science, he at once resolved to make a collection for him- 
self; and after a lapse of sixteen years, deposited in the Academy of Natural 
Sciences of Philadelphia a series embracing upwards of TOO human crania, and 
an equal number of inferior animals." This collection, now in the possession 
of the Academy, contains at the present time about 1100 crania, representing 
more than 170 different races and tribes of the human family. 
The establishment of this large and varied collection, and the important in- 
vestigations to which it has given rise, have served to stimulate sensibly the 
advance of Craniography in Europe. Some years ago, " the Emperor of Russia 
was induced to found at St. Petersburgh a national museum, exclusively dedi- 
cated to craniolgy, to contain the skulls of all the ancient and modern races of 
his vast dominions," (See Squiers' American Ethnology^ p. 3). All over Europe, 
Craniography is now being cultivated with considerable activity, and with 
highly valuable results, by such men as Retzius, Nilsson and Eschricht of Scan- 
dinavia, Gosse of Geneva, Dumoutier, Blanchard and Serres of France ; Engel, 
Zeune, Carus, Virchow, Buschke, Lucae, Fitzinger and others of Germany ; and 
by Davis, Thurnam, Williamson, Minchin and others in Great Britain. 
Many cranial collections are to be found in Europe and America, differing in 
the number and ethnic variety of their specimens. Precise information, how- 
ever, as to their location, extent, variety and proprietorship is not easily obtain- 
ed. From the writings of the craniographers above mentioned, and from my 
correspondents â especially Dr. J. Barnard Davis, of Shelton, Englandâ I have 
become acquainted with a few of these collections. The largest and most di- 
versified, as far as I know, is that contained in the Museum of the Army Medi- 
cal Department, at Fort Pitt, Chatham, England. Of the existence of this col- 
lection I was not aware, until a descriptive catalogue of it appeared in the 
Dublin Quarte/rly Journal of Medical Science^ for May and August, 1857. Through 

4' 
the kiadness of Dr. George Williamson, the author, I have since receiv ed a copy 
of this catalogue, containing valuable photographs of many of the skulls. 
The skulls embraced in the Chatham collection number about 600, and are 
arranged in 4 classes; 1st, oval-shaped skulls, including Europeans, Egyptians, 
Afghans, Hindoos, Singalese, New Zealanders, Otaheitans, &c. ; 2d, skulls with 
projecting alveolar processes, or with the nasal bones in the same plane, com- 
prising West African Negroes, Kafiirs, Hottentots, Bushmen, inhabitants of 
Mozambique and Madagascar, and the black natives of Mauritius, New South 
Wales and Van Diemen's-land ; 3d, skulls with very prominent superciliary 
ridges, containing Sandwich Islanders, and 4th, skulls with broad and flat face, 
including Burmese, Malays, Chinese, Eskimos and North American Indians 
The collection appears to be quite diversified. It contains specimens of about 
70 different tribes and nations. Among these are many not represented in the 
Academy's collection : such as Albanians, Maltese, Spanish, Baluchi, Pariahs 
and Singalese among the oval-headed; and Mandingos, Jololfs, Timmanni, 
Sossoos, Kassos, Hausas, Hanti, Attans or Oppas, Pappas or Mahais, Barconkas, 
Ashantis and others of the prognathous African form. 
Dr. Williamson's Catalogue is a very acceptable addition, not only to the 
literature of Craniography, but also to the means by which this science might 
be advanced. It contains short but important descriptions of 547 crania, and 
7 skeletons of different races of men, with extensive measurements of the same. 
The appendix embraces a number of anatomical measurements, estimates of 
the internal capacity, and a valuable table shoAving the relative frequency with 
which the ossa triquetra or Wormian bones appear in the occipital suture in 
the different varieties of men ; the number of instances in which the sphenoid 
is cut off from the parietal bone by a process of the temporal ; the number of 
instances in which the lachrymal groove is formed entirely on the nasal process 
of the superior maxillary bone ; the frequency of a suture in the centre of the 
frontal bone ; and the size of the occipital foramen in the various races. The 
author also calls attention to the difference in the form of the anterior nasal 
openings in different classes of skulls, and illustrates his remarks with a num- 
ber of outline engravings. 
Of the present location and condition of the collections made by the earlier 
craniologists â those industrious pioneers of the science â I know nothing. 
Soemmering, writing in 1785, speaks of having examined the collections of 
Camper at Klein-hankum ; of Hovius at Amsterdam ; of Walter at Berlin ; and 
of Blumenbach at Gottingen, ( Ueber die Korperliche Verschiedenheit des Negers 
com Europcier.) In the course of my reading, I have often found allusion 
to the cranial cabinets of Eau, (mentioned in Sandifort's Museum Anato- 
micam,) Albinus, Gualtherus van Doeveren, Munro, Kokilansky of Vienna and 
many others. Derwent Conway, in a work on Switzerland, published in 1830, 
says that "at the site of the cemetery of Zug is a Golgotha, where are thou- 
sands of skulls piled upon one another." Of Gall's famous collection, a cata- 
logue, translated from the French of Dr. Dauncey, his pupil and friend, appeared 
some years ago, in the 6th Vol. of the Edinburgh Phrenological Journal and Mis- 
cellany. In 1824 or 5 Mad. Becker, the niece of Gall's first wife, presented a 
portion of this collection to Dr. Roulett of Baden, near Vienna. Vimont's col- 
lection, in 1828, amounted to more than 1200 skulls and casts of man and ani- 
mals. The celebrated Deville collection, at the Strand, in London, numbered 
in 1830, more than 1800 casts and skulls. The Hunterian Museum, according 
to Prof. Owen's Catalogue published in 1853, contains a number of human crania. 
Judging from the numerous donations recorded, from time to time, in the differeat 
volumes of the Edinburgh Phrenological Journal, the Museum of the Society 
of that name must contain quite a large cranial collection. The collection of 
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland was catalogued by Prof. D. Wilson, while 
acting as Secretary of that Society. Twenty-five years ago, when Phrenology 
was exciting so much attention, numerous Phrenological Societies were founded 
in various parts of Great Britain. Busts, casts and skulls of men and animals 

5 
were industrioasly collected and deposited in the Museums of these Societies. 
But many of the latter having ceased to exist, after a few years of activity, it 
is not now easy, though very desirable, to obtain any information concerning 
the disposal made of their collections. 
Cranial collections are also contained in the Cabinets and Museums of many 
scientific associations, colleges, universities, &c., throughout Europe, such as 
the Koyal College of Surgeons, in London and Dublin, Guy's Hospital, the 
Yorkshire Philosophical Society, the Bristol Infirmary, the Senckenberg Natural 
History Society, the Josepheum in Vienna, the University of Dorpat, the 
Fremley Museum at Utrecht, Rijks Museum and the AnatomicaL Cabinet at 
Leyden, &c. &c. 
In a letter dated Shelton, 25th Dec. 1857, my friend Mr. J. Barnard Davis in- 
forms me that his private collection, at present, " exceeds 450 specimens." In 
the Museum of Thos. Bateman, Esq., at Lomberdale House, Derbyshire, England, 
are numerous skeletons, skulls, and separate bones, exhumed from tumuli 
chiefly of the Celtic period in Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Yorkshire," amount- 
ing at the time of the publication of his excellent antiquarian catalogue (1855) 
to 224 specimens. Among other private collections may be mentioned those of 
Retzius, Nilsson, Eschricht, Van der Hoeven, Thurnam, &c. 
The Mortonian collection, in this Academy, is by far the largest and most diver- 
sified in the United States, and, as far as I can learn, in the world. The Smith - 
sonian Institution is in possession of several hundred crania, chiefly of Ameri- 
can Indians. I have examined a few, also, in the Patent Office in Washington. 
Most of the cranial collections in this country are small and are principally 
contained in the Museums of Scientific Associations, Medical Colleges, Phreno- 
logical Societies, &c. In this city (Philadelphia) the Museum of the University of 
Pennsylvania contains 169 skulls ; that of the Jefferson College 12 ; that of the 
Pennsylvania College 125 ; and that of the Philadelphia College of Medicine 80. 
In the Canadian Journal of Industry, Science and Art for October, 1855, spe- 
cial directions were given with a view to the formation of a collection of An- 
cient Crania, illustrative of Canadian Ethnology." In the same Journal for 
November, 1856, the Editor Prof. D. Wilson, re-produces some of these direc- 
tions, in the hope of securing a more careful attention to the preservation of 
the human remains and relics of art found in the ancient sepulchral deposits in 
Canada. He appeals to the " members of the Canadian Institute, who are scat- 
tered over nearly every district of the Province," to contribute their share to 
the elucidation of Ethnological Science, by rescuing from destruction the re- 
mains of the ancient and more recently displaced aborigines, and the specimens 
of their rude arts, brought to light in the course of the agricultural, railway, 
and other operations, which are extending into new districts, breaking up virgin 
soil, and leading to extensive excavations in regions hitherto untouched by the 
spade or plough. 
From a later number of this Journal (November, ISST) it appears that in 
Canada there are several small collections of human crania contained in the 
Museums of the Canadian Institute, the Toronto University, Trinity and Knox's 
Colleges, and in the private cabinets of Prof. Wilson, and Drs. Rodder and 
Bovell, of Toronto, and the Rev. Jno. Gray, of Orillia. 
Now, from the foregoing remarks, the members of the Academy will perceive 
that, to the student of craniology, catalogues of all such collections, whether 
large or small â especially if they be descriptive â are of very considerable 
value. They make known to him the existence of other collections besides his 
own, and inform him what races and tribes of men are represented therein, 
or in other words, precisely how much and what available material has been 
collected for the furtherance of his scientific specialty. He may be desirous 
of studying the cranial characters of a particular race, of which the specimens 
in the only collection to which he has access are few in number or of doubtful 
origin. Having exact catalogues of the various cranial collections which have 
been made, from time to time, and deposited in different parts of the world, he 

6 
turns to these and at once learns how many specimens of this race, besides his 
own, have been collected and where they are located. He at once opens a 
correspondence with the proprietors of these collections, and is soon put in 
possession of any information which he may desire. 
Moreover, these catalogues would form an admirable basis for the interchange 
of duplicate crania, for the owners of them would know exactly where to apply 
to make up their deficiencies. The correspondence, also, to which the inter- 
change of catalogues and duplicate crania would give rise, would of itself 
greatly facilitate the progress of Craniography, by making the students of this 
science acquainted with each other, and enabling them by a private interchange 
of opinions to verify their conclusions or examine them in different points of 
view before publication. There can hardly be a doubt that the different col- 
lections would be respectively increased by the extensive distribution of such 
catalogues in the hands of army, navy, and other government officials, officers 
of merchantmen, travellers, naturalists connected with exploring expeditions, 
and others whose opportunities might be favorable to making such collections, 
and who would cheerfully do so were their attention once explicitly directed 
to this matter. 
Again, it appears to me that the progress of craniography might be very 
much and very readily facilitated by some such plan or system of co-operation 
as the following. Let all those actually engaged or interested in the study, in 
any particular country, notify the secretary, or appropriate officer, of the most 
prominent and best known scien Jific institution in that country, of the existence 
and precise location of any collection of crania with which they may be ac- 
quainted, no matter how small or imperfect such a collection may be, stating 
carefully the name and address of the Society or individual owning the collec- 
tion, the number of skulls contained, and the different races of men represented 
therein. Let the secretary or other officer receiving such communications 
cause them to be published from time to time in the printed journal, transactions 
or proceedings of the Society. These being sent in exchange or otherwise, to 
scientific associations and individuals in other countries, would thus become 
the vehicle for the transmission of this information to the craniographers of the 
latter places. 
The editors of scientific, medical and literary magazines, journals, reviews, 
&c., have it in their power greatly to promote craniographic science by insert- 
ing in their pages from time to time, and thus disseminating the information 
obtained in the manner indicated above. This statement particularly applies 
to medical Journals, inasmuch as most of those cultivating Craniography are 
physicians, not a few of whom are in the active public or private practice of 
their profession. 
These crude suggestions are offered to the Academy in the hope that, being 
distributed with its Proceedings, they may attract the attention and active sup- 
port of those who are interested in, and who are able and willing to advance so 
important a branch of the Science of Man,
