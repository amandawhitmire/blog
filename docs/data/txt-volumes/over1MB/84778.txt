VARIATION IN TWO SPECIES OF LUCIDELLA FROM JAMAICA. 

 BY AMOS P. BROWN. 



The genus Lucidella i.s best known from species found in the 

 island of Jamaica, from which locality the first species were figured 

 by Ferrusac' under the name of Helix aureola. Ferrusac then figures 

 the two common .species of Jamaica, which appear to have a general 

 distribution throughout most parts of the island. The.se species 

 are very plentiful in the interior of the island, particularly in the 

 Mandeville region. They live in the more undisturbed parts along 

 the borders of woods, seeming to prefer situations where there is a 

 certain amount of sun, rather than in the dense woods. Along 

 the roads they are met with inhabiting the stone walls, which are 

 the common fences in this part of the island. When once established 

 in the walls they appear to flourish, even when the woods are cut 

 away from the vicinity of the roads, and where they have plenty 

 of cover and not too much dryness they develop into as large forms 

 as in the more undisturbed regions. Lucidella aureola (F^r.) is 

 probably more generally and widely di.stributed, but L. granulosa 

 C. B. Adams is more plentiful in the Mandeville country, though 

 both forms are found living together. Along grassy roadsides with 

 low limestone rock exposures and even where the' red residual clay 

 from the limestone forms the banks of the road they are found 

 in numbers; in the case of the red clay banks, perhaps L. aureola 

 is somewhat more common, while L. granulosa is found more fre- 

 quently in numbers where the limestone exposures are seen. This 

 habit of living along the borders of woods and in the more open 

 rocky woods is common with both species in the more undisturlicd 

 regions where the original forest .still exists. 



These two species have adapted themselves to the conditions 

 brought about by advancing civilization and clearing of the land, 

 and are well established, even in the oldest settled districts, being 

 found in numbers in many places that have been quite stripped of

till' original forest. But it is to be noted that it is in the.sc places, 

 where the wood.s have been cleared for a long period of years, that 

 a reduction not in numbers of individuals, but in size may be ob- 

 served. While the evidence is not entirely complete, it seems to 

 point to a reduction in .size in those places where the forest has been 

 entirely cleared away and where the animals are now living under 

 conditions of greater dryness than the optimum conditions that obtain 

 in places where the original forest is still more or le.ss undisturbeil. 

 The variations treated of in this paper are seen in individuals of 

 these species that are living under the optimum conditions which 

 obtain in the forested sections, as contrasted with those individuals 

 which are found in the dryer, cleared sections. The localities from 

 which these contrasted individuals were obtained are in Manchester 

 Parish, near Mandeville for L. granulosa; and for L. aureola, the 

 same region as contrasted with the Montego Baj^ district. 



Lucidella granulosa is found almost everj-where in the region 

 about Mandeville where the conditions are favorable. It is in 

 this locality much more common than L. aureola, which, however, 

 is found plentifully in this part of Manchester. But L. granulosa 

 was not taken at Montego Bay, while a small form of L. aureola 

 was very plentiful at this station. Perhaps the most tyjiical forms 

 of L. granulosa come from the borders of the undisturbed woods 

 in Manchester Parish near Mandeville, and it .seems likely that it 

 was from this region that C. B. Adams first collected the form. 

 From the many colonies in the Mandeville region from which I 

 collected these tyjjical forms of this .species the Somerset, Somerset 

 Road, and Benmore woods colonies may be selected as furnishing 

 characteristic examples of the normal form. These localities have 

 been described in a former paper;'- it will suffice here to state that 

 they were places where the original forest .still exists and optimum 

 conditions for the growlh of this species obtain. The small forms 

 that are compared with these typical forms were collected at two 

 stations where the forest had liecn comjiletely cleared, at least 

 near the roads along which the collecting was done, and wer(> near 

 the Sturridge place, some three miles to the southeast of Mandeville 

 village, and along the Kendal Road,' one mile to the north of the 

 town. A short description of the.se stations will be necessary.

The Sturridge place, alwut three miles to the southeast of 

 Mandeville, is in the old settled part of the region. Here the original 

 forest has long been cleared, and the country is almost bare of shade 

 trees. A few scattered orange or pimento trees along the roadsides 

 are the only protection from the tropical sun, and the bare fields, 

 while grassy, have an arid look as compared to the dense woods 

 of the original forest. The only cover for the mollusks is in the 

 stone walls, which, as usual, are built along the roads as fences. 

 An old private burying-ground, doubtless belonging to the Sturridge 

 place, had a few trees growing in it which made a little shade and this 

 old cemetery wall was the most favorable place for mollusks that 

 was found 'at this point. Here and at a few places nearbj- along 

 the road specimens of L. granulosa were obtained. Thej^ were 

 not very plentiful, but were found in fair numbers, and in as great 

 numbers as any other species of mollusk collected at this point. 

 They were quite uniiormly small specimens. They inhabited the 

 wall, utilizing its cover, and were collected from the wall and from 

 the ground at its base. 



The other station where the small form of L. granulom was taken 

 was on the Kendal Road, one mile north of Mandeville; along a 

 part of the road through pasture lands where the trees had been 

 cleared back from the road on the more level ground, so that there 

 was but little shade along the road. Here again the Lucidellas 

 were living in the low stone walls which lined the road and were 

 especially abundant in places where the top of the wall was covered 

 with moss or fern. Here the dead shells of this small form of L. 

 granulosa were very plentiful, many in very fresh condition, but, 

 during the dry time when I was collecting, no living individuals 

 were seen moving about. They had apparently come up on the 

 tops of the walls to escape from the rain during wet weather 

 and died there. At this place the only cover for the snails was to 

 be found in the wall itself. This, as in the case of the .Sturridge 

 place, must have been very dry except after a shower or during the 

 rather uncertain rainy seasons. This small form of L. granulosa 

 is well established at this station, but onlj' the small individuals 

 were seen, as was the case at the Sturridge place. It is practically 

 a small local race at each locality. 



While not so plentiful as L. granulosa in the Mandeville region, 

 I,, aureola is found almost everywhere that the comlitions are favor- 

 able. This species lives on the ground and is found on grassy l)aiiks, 

 even where there is no rock. It does not reciuire rock piles or walls

for cover, cvitlently grassy pastures offering sufficient cover and 

 food for the species. This probably explains its present wide 

 distribution, a^s compared with L. granulosa, and its persisting in 

 places where the other species are not now found. It occurred along 

 the borders of the woods in the Somerset region and along the road- 

 sides at almost all places about ]\Iandeville, especially being col- 

 lected along the Lower Santa Cruz Road in considerable numbers. 

 Here it was living on the grassy borders of the road, and was taken 

 from the clay banks in places where, for instance, Cepolis [Hemi- 

 trochtis) graminicola was common. Along this Santa Cruz road the 

 forest is mostly cleared, but the L. aureola has sufficient cover in the 

 grass of the pastures which the road passes through. Both here 

 and especially at Somerset, two places selected as furnishing normal 

 forms of the species, the animals are living under what may be 

 termed optimum conditions. Nowhere in the ]VIande\-ille region, 

 in fact (except perhaps near the Sturridge place, where L. aureola 

 was not found), are the fields really arid and, for a form that can 

 live on the ground with only grass for cover, the conditions are 

 perhaps never very unfavorable. A small form of this species is found 

 at Montego Bay, a region where the soil is so thin that the clearing 

 of the forest has resulted in the development of conditions that may 

 be descriljed as arid, at least during the dry part of the year. Mon- 

 tego Bay is one of the oldest settlements in the island, dating back 

 to the Spanish occupation. The original forest has been cleared oft" 

 all of the more level ground, which has been under cultivation for 

 proijably the greater part of a century. AVhere trees have been 

 planted, they are mostly logwood, which is grown in the pastures; 

 the trees being planted sufficiently far apart to allow the pa.sture 

 grass plenty of sun. In these logwood plantations, especially if 

 they are on a slope, the soil is very thin and the rock comes near the 

 surface. During the dry season the ground gets very parclied 

 and the gra.ss quite brown; in the wet season, from the end of April 

 to the end of Novemljer, when showers may occur at any time, the 

 torrential rains sflinost innnediately drain off on the hill slopes, 

 and owing to the jwrous character of the soil the ground becomes 

 quite dry between the showers. For a great i)art of the year, 

 except when a rainy week may occur in May or November, any 

 mollusks that are grounil dwellers must exist under alternating 

 short jieriods of great moisture and dryness, while during the (.Iry 

 sea.son, from December to April, they must lestivate under the almost 

 arid conditions which obtain.

 Lucidella undulata Pfr., Malak., Bl. VIII, 1861, p. 171. 



This is the species usually labelled L. undulata in collections. 

 It was first figured by Ferrusac along with L. aureola under the name 

 Helicina aureola. The two figures on Ferrusac's plate 49A numbered 

 1 represent a form covered with granules which he considered to 

 be a variety of Helix aureola and which is the common species of 

 Lucidella in the Manchester district. C. B. Adams refers to this 

 form as follows: "A variety of Lucidella aureola is so strongh' sculp- 

 tured ^x-ith granules that it wnll be convenient to designate the 

 variety with the name of granulosa." (Adams, loc. cit.) This was 

 in 1850, and eleven years afterwards, in 1861, Pfeiffer describes 

 this form, referring to Ferrusac's figure above mentioned, under 

 the name of L. undulata. It is by this name of Pfeiffer's that the 

 species is generally known, although the granulosa of Adams ante- 

 dates Pfeiff'er's name by eleven years. Ina.smuch as C. B. Adams 

 collected in the Mandeville region in Manchester, it is very likely 

 that his granulosa came from this district. In a former paper* 

 it is recorded in the IMandeville region from Benmore, Bloomfield, 

 Sturridge place. Cedar Hill, Lower Santa Cruz Road, ridge near 

 Lincoln, Somerset, Somerset Road, and it was aHo collected on 

 the Kendal Road north of Mande\'ille as well as several other places 

 in this vicinity. Most of the specimens of this species in the 

 A. N. S. P. Collection were taken by me in 1910, but there are three 

 or four trays simply recorded as from "Jamaica," one of which 

 marked "Swift Collection" is of especial interest. This lot probably 

 came from H. Vendries, of Kingston, and is marked on the collector's 

 label "L. aureola Fer. var. granulosa"; they possess the characters 

 which seem to distinguish this species in a pronounced degree. 

 If these are Vendries specimens tliey no doubt came from St. Andrews 

 Parish. They may be described as follows: 



Lacidella granulosa C. B. Ad. (Swift CoUecton A. X. S. P.) Plate I, figs 1-3.

covering the entire surface, those al)ove the peri])hery being swollen 

 at inter\-als, when crossed by the railial wrinkles or corrugations 

 that follow the growth lines, thus forming both the raised granula- 

 tion and the whitish spots, from the raised lir£e becoming whitish 

 where swollen. The swelling of the revolving spirals becomes very 

 pronounced along the periphery, which is thus raised into a series of 

 tubercles, commencing about the beginning of the fourth whorl 

 and continuing to the lip. The swelling of the lirse to form the 

 granulation does not extend far below the periphery, not more than 

 4 or 5 of the revolving striae being thus affected. The stria continue, 

 however, to the umbilicus, becoming fainter as this is approached. 

 Diam. 7.7, alt. 5.5 mm. 



The keeled and tuberculated periphery' seems to be characteristic 

 of this species, but is not always, as in this Swift Collection lot, 

 carried out to the lip. It is present in the young shells in all ca.ses, 

 which would .seem to indicate that the ancestral species must have 

 resembled this one from the Swift Collection. None of the Mande- 

 ville region specimens normally show this tuberculated and keeled 

 periphery in the adult state, at least not entirely up to the lip; 

 but the young all show it. The Somerset Road specimens (Plate 

 I, figs. G, 10), which perhaps lived under as nearly optimum condi- 

 tions for this species as any collected in the Mandevilie region, 

 show this tuberculated and keeled periphery u]) to nearly the end 

 of the fifth whorl, but the peripheral tuberculation dies away 

 liefore the sixth whorl is reached. Young shells from this station 

 have quite a different appearance from the adults. This .seems, as 

 above .stated, to be the general condition of the species in the Man- 

 chester region, the adult stage has lost the peripheral granulation, 

 but the younger stages show it. And it is perha])s more jironounced 

 in the Somerset specimens than in any of the others, the last whorl 

 being freejuently nearly smooth (Plate I, fig. 4, figs. 7-9), on the 

 periphery. An exceptional specimen from Somerset, showing the 

 tuberculated periphery, is figured at o on the plate. Th(> tuberculate 

 condition of the periphery extends from the middle of the third 

 whorl (2.5 whorls from the apex) to the middle of the fifth whorl 

 (4.5 whorls from the apex). Thus the last whorl (there are five 

 and one-half to .six whorls) is com]iaratively smooth on the pe- 

 riphery, and, exi'ept for the color pattern, the shell at first sight 

 resembles />. (iitreola. The color pattern itself varies when the 

 peri|)heral tuberculation disappears; when it is |>ri'si'iil tlirre is u 

 regular periodicity in the recurrence of the whiti>h patches which 




1913.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 9 



mark the swelling of the Hrae that is the cause of the lighter spots, 

 they run from 16 to 20 to the whorl, and when this periodicity is 

 seen with the whitish spots reaching the periphery, this in turn 

 becomes tuberculated and keeled. This regularity of the markings 

 is characteristic of the younger stages, and as long as it is seen the 

 young shell will be found to be keeled and tuberculated: when it 

 disappears and the color pattern becomes a mottling of the shell, then 

 the periphery is neither keeled nor tuberculated. In the two places 

 where dwarfed shells were taken, a large number of them have 

 this tuberculated and keeled periphery on the last whorl, although 

 considerably less than half are so ornamented. It is noticeable 

 that the whitish ornamentation, when it is accompanied by the pe- 

 ripheral tuberculation, follows the growth lines, and is then more 

 continuous and stronger. But when it curves towards the mouth 

 of the shell and crosses the growth lines, it tends to break up into 

 branches, rarely reaches the periphery, and practicallj' never causes 

 tuberculation. When the animals are living under optimum condi- 

 tions, as at the Somerset and Somerset Road stations, this bending 

 forward of the ornamentation across the growth lines becomes 

 characteristic, and the color pattern becomes finer and less regular 

 by the branching of these whitish lines or by their breaking up into 

 dots. And where this finely mottled color pattern is seen, the last 

 whorl is nearly smooth and the periphery is free from tubercles. 



The tuberculated condition of the periphery is thus a character 

 of the young stages, .sometimes continued into the adult stages 

 up to the development of the lip. The appearance of this character 

 in the dwarfed races (Plate I, figs. 11-15) at Kendal Road station 

 and at the Sturridge .station is due to what is generally described 

 as "reversion to an ancestral form"; or it is due to the animals, 

 living under unfavorable conditions as regards shell development 

 and growth, which causes them to mature at an earlier stage than 

 tliose forms which live under optimum conditions. But while the 

 conditions are unfavorable to growth, they are not unfavorable to 

 reproduction, for the.se dwarfed forms are very plentiful at the 

 localities where they were taken. \n examination of the shells 

 of these Kendal Road and Sturridge forms will show at once from 

 the,growth lines that they grew with many interruptions, a.s many 

 as 30 such interruptions being often seen in one shell. Those from 

 Kendal Road station al.so mature earlier, as they have only five 

 whorls, instead of five and one-half or six, as in forms growing under 

 more favorable conditions. Tlic forms that live in walls, whether 




10 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



of this species or any other, where the wall is their only cover, are 

 always subject to such recurring periods of enforced inactivity, 

 during drj' spells and with the long period of the dry season, which 

 may last for several months, during which the sexual organs prob- 

 ably mature. These wall dwellers become active after every shower, 

 and probably sestivate temporarily during the dry spells between 

 showers, so they have manj- less growing days throughout the year 

 than forms that may move about and feed any day. Each sesti- 

 vation period is marked by a pronounced growth line, and the 

 30 or more such interruptions mentioned above are thus recorded. 

 If the adult stage is reached by the animal before the shell has passed 

 through the tuberculated-and-keeled periphery stage of shell growth, 

 then the adult, with lip developed, has this tuberculated periphery; 

 if this stage has been passed the last whorl is smooth and not tuber- 

 culated along the periphery. In the Sturridge place forms, where 

 the whorls may reach five and one-half, but few show the tuber- 

 culation of the periphery extending out to the lip:

This is the most widely distributed species of LucideUa in the 

 island of Jamaica, but it generally occurs in small numbers at any 

 one station. Specimens of this species were examined that were 

 collected in Portland (Port Antonio), St. Andrews (Stony Hill and 

 Coastant Spring), St. Catharine (Natural Bridge, Bog Walk), Man- 

 chester (various points near Mandeville), and St. James (Montego 

 Bay at Orange Hill and Rose Mount) as well as a number of other 

 collections of which the locality was not recorded further than as 

 from "Jamaica." Among these, the race from St. James as found at 

 Orange Hill and Rose Mount is a small, dwarfed form which is differ- 

 ent from any .seen elsewhere, and is only matched in size by an occa- 

 sional spcvinien from the region to the southwest of Mandeville, 

 along the Santa Cruz road. With the exception of this St. James 

 race from the vicinity of Mont ego Bay, the general description of 

 the species (Plate I, figs. 16-21) is as follows: 



Shell depre.s.sed conoifial, spire somewhat convex, apex mucronate; 

 uniformly cf)lored some shade of chestnut, paler in the young shells; 

 the shell sculptured with fine revolving line anfl the whorls crossed 

 by oblique wrinkles which follow the growth lines in direction,

beginning to appear generally on the second whorl and sometimes 

 continuing to the lip, but dying away towards the periphery, or, 

 if they cros.s it, not producing a thickening of the lirae at this point. 

 Whorls six or somewhat over (6.3) and rarely less than 5.7. The 

 revolving strise become fainter and are almost obsolete in the 

 umbilicus. The number of these revolving striae varies through 

 the appearance of interstitial lirse between those alreadj^ existing, 

 which eventually develop to the same size as the others. There 

 are generally about 45 lirje on the last whorl, of which 18 or 20 

 are above the periphery, they are close and even and are not thick- 

 ened where the oblique wrinkles cross them. The size varies with 

 the locality, ranging from diam. = 10 mm. by alt. = 7.7 mm. 

 (Pfeiffer) to diam. = 5.6 mm. bj^ alt. = 4.3 in the smallest specimen 

 taken in the vicinity of Mandeville. 



This smallest specimen, ^hich came from the Lower Santa Cruz 

 Road about three miles from Mandeville is simply a diminutive 

 reproduction of the largest which was found at Somerset, with 

 somewhat fewer whorls but with none of the peripheral granulation 

 observed on some of the Montego Bay specimens (Plate I, figs. 

 22-26). These latter, which, as stated above, were collected on the 

 Orange Hill and the Rose Mount estates, differ from the typical 

 L. aureola above described in certain specimens. In about one-half 

 of th(! Orange Hill specimens and about one-third of the Rose Mount 

 s])ecimens an additional sculptural feature is present. The pe- 

 riphery of the last whorl is raised into a series of points or tubercles, 

 by the thickening of one or more of the peripheral lira; where they 

 are crossed by the transverse oblique wrinkles which are present in 

 all .specimens of this species examined. This structure is exactly 

 comparable to the development of the granulate sculpture on L. 

 (jmnulom which has been described. A careful examination of the 

 >oung of tjTiical L. aureola from .some fifteen localities shows that 

 while the oblique transverse wrinkles are common to all of them, 

 these do not produce any granulation on the periphery, so that this 

 is not, as in the case of the dwarfed races of L. granulosa, a "rever- 

 sion" or the effect of the individual's maturing at what is normally 

 a young stage, but actually a new sculptural character which has 

 developed in these Montego Bay forms. It only appears distinctly 

 (jn the last whorl, the tubercles becoming stronger after the i)eriphery 

 i-merges from the suture, but it may be present on the preceding 

 wliorl also, as the corrugations or wrinkles are found well ileveloped 

 on both the last and next to the last whorls. When well developed. 




12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



the granulations continue out to the hp; sometimes they only appear 

 in the middle part of the last whorl and become obsolescent towards 

 the lip. They are well shown and their connection with the trans- 

 verse wTinkles is apparent in the figs. 22, 25, 26, Plate I. This 

 peripheral granulation is thus characteristic of certain of the speci- 

 mens taken at Orange Hill and Rose Mount, Montego Bay, and is 

 not found in the normal L. aureola from any other locality examined. 

 The forms possessing it might be designated by a varietal name, as 

 montegoensis, and it is probably the beginning of a new species, 

 or what' would become one if the forms continued to live at the 

 Montego Bay localities, which, unless the settling up of the country 

 continues, is likely to be the ca.se, they having survived the advance 

 of civilization for perhaps a century. But it may be a variation 

 not due directly to the aridity of the country produced by the 

 clearing of the land — not referable to change of environment alone — 

 but to hijbridity, and thi.s might work out in future generations. 



We thus have two species, each developing a dwarfed race under 

 similar conditions of environment, but in which the causes for the 

 development of the new sculptural characters which accomimny 

 the dwarfing are probably not referable to the same causes. 



The Variation in Size. 



The amount of the variation in .size may be graphically shown 

 by plotting the dinicn.sions of the forms to scale in the manner 

 adopted in a previous paper.* These dimensions are given below. 



Variation in size in Lucidella (jranulosa C. B. Adams. — The 

 forms of this species compared in fig. 1 are from Somerset, Somerset 

 Road, Benmore, Kendal Road one mile north of Mandeville, and the 

 Sturridge place, three miles southea.st of Mandeville. Those from 

 Somerset and Somerset Road are the largest, those from Kendal 

 Road and the Sturridge place the smallest. The Benmore specimens 

 lie between these two, but nearer to the larger group, so that the plot 

 shows two groups as to size, with a gap between the two that is 

 not entirely bridged over by the Benmore specimens. The normal 

 forms, represented by the group of larger specimens from these 

 localities, show some variation in the .sculpture, but are in general 

 as described above for the forms from Somerset and Somerset Road, 

 with a nearly non-tuberculated periphery on the last wiiorl. Only

a few of the Somerset specimens show the keeled and tuberculated 

 periphery that is characteristic of the Swift Collection specimens, 

 of which a description is given above. These are, however, of normal 

 size for the species, as may be seen from the plate (figs. 4, 5, 7-9). 

 A few individuals from Benmore show this tuberculated periphery 

 also. 



Contra.sted with this smooth condition of the last whorls, which 

 may be considered normal for L. granulosa as found near Mandeville, 

 is the much larger proportion of tuberculated-keeled forms found

among the specimens from the two localities where the forms are 

 dwarfed. At the Sturridge place, about one-half of the specimens 

 show peripheral granules on the last whorl, though these tend to be- 

 come obsolescent a.s the lip is approached. In the Kendal Road 

 specimens .somewhat over two-thirds show this granulation, and in 

 many cases it extends out to the lip, a much smaller proportion 

 showing this granulation of the peripheral lira becoming obsoles- 

 cent and dying away as the lip is approached than in the case of

the Sturridge specimens. The reduction in size in L. yranulosa 

 in these localities is accompanied by a slight reduction in the size 

 of the embryonic shell or protoconch, which is easily observed 

 in all cases in the adult shell. The minor diameter of the protoconch 

 averages 0.47 mm. in the specimens from the larger group, the 

 average being for the Benmore specimens 0.444 mm., for the Somerset 

 Road specimens 0.47 mm., and for the Somerset specimens 0.50 ram.; 

 as against an average of 0.416 mm. for the Kendal Road specimens 

 and 0.408 for the Sturridge place forms. There is thus a dwarfing 

 that is not alone individual, but a racial dwai-fing. The.se characters 

 are well sho\vn by a comparison of the dimensions by whorls which 

 is given in fig. 2. A series of characteristic specimens were selected 

 from each locality and each individual measured by whorls with an

eyepiece micrometer on the microscope, using of course a mechanical 

 stage to adjust the specimen. The measurements by whorls and 

 the minor diameter of the protoconch are plotted in the figure. 

 This la.'it character hardly shows well at this scale, the differences 

 being small. The comparison by whorls brings out the fact that 

 in spite of the dwarfed character of two of these races, but little 

 reduction in size is shown up to the third whorl and the difference 

 in size only becomes pronounced at the fourth whorl. All of these 

 forms, whether normal or dwarfed, possess at least five whorls, 

 so that up to this point the growth rate is strictly comjiarable. 

 The marked falling off in size of the two dwarfed races at this point 

 is to be attributed to the environment alone. The still more marked 

 falling off in diameter as shown in the last whorl is partly due to a 

 reduction in the numi)er of whorls in the dwarfed races, this falling 

 from the ma.ximum of .somewhat over six whorls in the larger forms 

 from Somerset, Somerset Road, and Benmore to between five and six

for the two dwarfed races from Sturridge's and Kendal Road, although 

 even at these two localities the whorls may reach six in some cases. 



Variation in size in Lucidella aureola (Per.). — The forms of 

 this species compared in fig. 3 are from Somerset, Santa Cruz Road 

 and Orange Hill, ]\Iontego Bay; and to these has been added a series 

 from the A. N. S. P. old collection labelled simply "Swift Col- 

 lection," and recorded as from "Jamaica" without any definite 

 locality. These divide at once into two groups, of which the Somerset,

Swift Collection, and Santa Cruz Road lots are larger, the Montego 

 Bay lot is smaller. It will be seen, however, that a single specimen 

 from the Santa Cruz Road series approaches the Montego Bay 

 .specimens in size, being of less diameter than any of this Orange 

 Hill (Montego Bay) series. The Swift Collection series are all 

 proportionately Iiigher than those from Somerset, which otherwise 

 they compare well with in size. The Santa Cruz specimens lived 




16 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



in the open fields and in walls along the roadside, their only cover 

 being the walls or the low vegetation of the fields, and they are 

 all smaller than the Somerset and Swift Collection series. The 

 one exceptionally small specimen was adult, so far as development 

 of the lip was concerned, and in size would correspond to Pfeiffer's 

 variety which he calls L. aureola minor, being even smaller than his 

 dimensions for that form. But while it compares in size with the 

 Montego Bay forms, it is not at all like them in sculpture, resembling 

 the normal L. aur^la of the island generally. It is evident, then, 

 that the normal L. aureola may vary in size in occasional individuals 

 down to that of the dwarfed or "runt" race found near Montego 

 Bay. This last race is a composite one, in about one-half of the 

 Orange Hill specimens and one-third of the Rose Mount specimens 

 a distinctive sculpture characterizes the forms. This has already 

 been described above. The minor diameter of the protoconch is 

 also somewhat less than in the normal forms of this species, this 

 dimension varies from 0.55 mm. in the Somerset and Swift Col-

lection specimens to 0.50 mm. in the Santa Cruz Road s]iecimens 

 and 0.45 mm. in those from Montego Bay. 



A comparison of the dimensions of L. aureola by whorls is given 

 in fig. 4, where these protoconch diameters are plotted along with 

 the heights. It will be seen that the diameters by whorls do not 

 show much variation in the four lots of specimens examined until 

 the third whorl is passed, but a marked falling off in the diameter 

 of the Santa Cruz Road and the Mont(>g() Bay specimens commences 

 with the fourth whorl, becomes still more pronounced in the fifth 

 whorl and culminates in the last whorl. As in the case of L. yranu- 

 losa, there 'is a reduction in the number of whorls in the adult stage 

 in the case of the dwarfed Montego Bay forms which accentuates 

 the diminution in diameter after the fifth whorl. The number of 

 whorls is of course larger in the larger sjiecimens from Somerset, 

 the Swift Collection lot and the Santa Cruz Road specimens, being 

 generally over six whorls, whereas the specimens from Montego Ba.v 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



range from five to five and three-tenths whorls, and in rare cases 

 one may reach five and one-half whorls. As in the case of L. granu- 

 losa, the reduction in size is accompanied by a reduction in the number 

 of whorls, and the animal matures at an earlier stage of shell develop- 

 ment than is the case in the larger normal forms. The small speci- 

 men from Santa Cruz Road which approximates in size the Montego 

 Bay specimens had only five and three-tenths whorls, as thej- have, 

 and a few other Santa Cruz Road specimens, which are small, run 

 about five and seven-tenths whorls. 



The Causes of the \'ariation in Size and Sculpture. 



In the case of the variation of the two species herein described 

 it is plain that we have to deal with two different kinds of variation : 

 (1) A reduction in size from the normal type and (2) a change of 

 sculpture. The cause of the change of size is the same in both 

 cases and has already been stated. The reduction in size is undoubt- 

 edly brought about bj^ the drier and more arid environment which 

 retards the growth of the individual; superimposed upon which is 

 the regular periodicity of climatic changes due to the changing 

 seasons, which induces the development of the reproductive organs 

 at a given time in the year, without much regard to the size the in- 

 dividual has attained. Thus the forms living under arid conditions 

 will have only reached the beginning of the sixth whorl (or passed 

 the completion of the fifth whorl) when the enforced aestivation 

 brought on by the dry season commences. During the dry sea.son 

 all of these snails are more or less inactive, and during this resting 

 stage the genitalia are developed. The lip probably commences 

 to develop about the same time. Forms living under optimum 

 conditions have reached the beginning of the seventh whorl when this 

 occurs; they will have an extra whorl as compared with the forms 

 living under arid conditions, which would have had many less 

 feeding and growing days, and which latter, no doubt, have passed 

 through many short periods of aestivation during their period of 

 growth, which was frequently interrupted by the dry spells between 

 showers. Probably from the repeated sestivation periods that these 

 dwarfed forms must pass through, there has been produced an 

 actual decrease in the size of the embryo, as is indicated by the re- 

 duction in the size of the protoconch; and this may mark the fixing 

 of the small race, even though their environment may change; 

 but this dwarfing of the embryo is not needed to ex[)lain the reduction 

 in size. 




18 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF . [Jan., 



The change of sculpture which accompanies the reduction in 

 size is to be differently explained in the case of each species. In 

 the one case, that of L. granulosa, it has been shown to be directly 

 connected with the reduction in size, which in turn is brought about 

 by the loss of a whorl. The sculpture in this case is that of the 

 young shell up to the beginning of the sixth whorl (up to 5.3 whorls 

 generally), and is a necessary accompaniment of the loss of a whorl. 

 In the case of normal forms in which this sculpture exists, as in the 

 occasional specimens from Somerset or the Swift Collection speci- 

 men of L. granulosa, this sculpture seems to have persisted up 

 to the end of the sixth whorl; and, as pointed out, it may be an 

 ancestral character which is becoming obsolescent. But it has been 

 rejuvenated in these dwarfed forms by the process known as rever- 

 sion. 



The case of the change of sculpture in the dwarfed forms of 

 L. aureola is different. Here we are not dealing ^\-ith a character 

 which exists in the young stages and is simply disclosed by the 

 leaving off of a whorl, as in the last case, but with a new character 

 of which no trace is to be found in the young of the normal species. 

 It may be an adaptation in response to the change of environment 

 or it may be due to the effect of hybridity. It is here that the evi- 

 dence is incomplete. 



It is not knowTi whether the other form that would likely hybridize 

 with L. aureola occurs (or has occurred) at Montego Bay. I mean 

 the species L. granulosa. In a large collection made at Montego 

 Bay in 1910 I did not encounter this species, nor is it found in 

 Henderson's list^ as being found at this point. It might be found 

 in some of the deposits of semi-fossil shells that occur near Montego 

 Bay, but while I examined these, I did not find any specimens of 

 L. granulosa. If it existed at Orange Hill and at Rose Mount pre- 

 vious to the clearing of the land it would probably die out, as this 

 species requires more cover than is to be found in the logwood-planted 

 pastures where the Montego Bay race of L. aureola is now living. 

 And during its extinction it might very conceivably have mixed 

 with the L. aureola, which thrives well in grass lands elsewhere in 

 the island. The hybrid thus produced would be likely to have a 

 tuberculated perijjhery. And the hybrid living with a normally 

 sculptured, pure race of L. aureola would tend through hybridity 

 to cliangi- back to the normal sculpture of this latter s])ccies.

1913.] XATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 19 



On the other hand, the variation may be a response to change of 

 environment, the animals becoming adapted to arid conditions. 

 Of coui-se, this adaptation is evident as regards the reduction in size, 

 but it is not yet known that animals living with deficiency of moisture 

 necessarily become more or differently sculptured. The chief 

 effect of this aridity would be to reduce the moisture of the bod}% 

 and this may conceivably produce an increase of sculpture. Re- 

 duction of moisture followed by an increase of moisture tends to induce 

 proliferation. This has been noted by Loeb' in the case of the eggs 

 of the sea urchin. When newly fertilized eggs are placed in hyper- 

 tonic sea water for three or four hours and then brought back into 

 normal sea water, they divide into from six to sixteen cells in about 

 ten minutes, and in some cases even into about forty cells inside 

 of twenty minutes. The reduction of moisture in the egg was here 

 sufficient to inhibit cell division, but not enough to prevent nuclear 

 division. When put back into normal sea water, a most powerful 

 streaming of the protoplasm was observed. This streaming seemed 

 to occur around the chromosomes and fragments of nuclear matter 

 as centres. At length each knob or projection formed by the 

 streaming became a separate cell. The effect of the hj'pertonic 

 sea water (made by adding salt to normal sea water) was to with- 

 draw water from the cell. Putting the egg back into normal sea 

 water added water to the cell. ^Estivation must result in with- 

 drawal of water from the protoplasm, and may proceed to the point 

 of gelation. Addition of water to the protopla.sm after such aesti- 

 vation, might readily result in proliferation as a result of the irregular 

 nuclear di\'ision produced during the aestivation period when cell 

 division could not occur. The irregular thickening of the shell 

 that forms the peripheral tubercles and other increase of sculpture 

 is of the nature of a proliferation of the shell. This is conceivably 

 due to the irregular cell division produced by aestivation, which in 

 turn is preceded by nuclear division without accomi3an>ing cell 

 formation during the aestivation period. Normally a cell dividing 

 produces two daughter cells, but under this fluctuation of the water 

 content the number of daughter cells may be from* six, eight, etc. ; 

 or M = 2D may become M=4D (or 6D or 8D, etc.). 



Boveri' has shown that the conditions which bring about cell 

 division seem to depend upon a ratio between the ma-ss of the 

 chromosomes to the mass of j>rotopla.sm being established, and occurs 



' Loeb, Jour, of Morphology, Vol. 7, p. 25.3, 1892. 

 ' Boveri, ZeUen Sludien, Heft o, Jena, 190.5. 




20 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



when the ratio chromosomes to protoplasm reaches a certain con- 

 stant. Increase of the mass of the chromosomes retards cell division, 

 which does not occur until the mass of the protoplasm increases 

 also. The material for the growth of the chromosomes is furnished 

 by the protoplasm, from its "reserve material," according to Sachs. 

 So cell gro^\'th consists in the transformation of protoplasmic into 

 chromatin material in the nucleus until a defitiite ratio of P : C = k 

 is reached, when division occurs. The mother cell just before divis- 

 ion consists of nC-i-P = M. After division M divides into 2D 

 each being nC'-r-P'. These daughter cells then grow to the size 

 and ratio of the mother cell, or until nC'-^P' becomes nC^P, 

 when division may again occur. Starvation produces a reduction 

 in the amount of protoplasm and retards the development of tiie 

 chromosomes, ^^stivation will cause reduction in the amount of 

 protoplasm and retard cell division. J. Sachs was the first to point 

 out that in each species the ultimate size of the cell is a constant 

 for each organ and that where two individuals differ in size, the differ- 

 ence is in the number and not the size of corresponding cells. 

 Amelung, a student of Sachs, confirmed this by actual count. But 

 it seems probable that diminution in the amount of protoplasm 

 may be accompanied or followed by a reduction in the mass of the 

 chromosomes and reduction in the size of the nuclei, and as the ratio 

 C^P is constant for cell division, then Ch-P = M by reduction of 

 mass of both C and P to C and P' becomes C'^P' = M', a smaller 

 cell. It is in this way that the observed reduction in size of the 

 embryonic shell or protoconch in these dwarfed forms of the two 

 species of Lticidella here considered is to be explained. For this 

 reduction in size of the protoconch must accompany a reduction 

 in the size of the egg, and it is probably the establishing of a new 

 equilibrium resulting in the reduction in size of the egg (among 

 other things) that is the explanation of the observation that condi- 

 tions unfavorable to the growth of the animal arc not unfavorable 

 to its reproduction.

SOME AUSTRALIAN BEES. 

 BY T. D. A. COCKERELL. 



In 1904 there were 222 species of native bees known from Aus- 

 tralia. At the present moment (January, 1913) there are 583, 

 if we inehide the species described below and 24 others sent for 

 publication but not actually published at the time of writing. 

 Even this comparatively large number must represent but a small 

 minority of the species actually existing, as many districts have 

 never been examined for i^ees, and every new collection contains a 

 considerable percentage of undescribed forms. The best-explored 

 district is the region about Mackay, Queensland, which was for many 

 years the hunting ground of Rowland and Gilbert Turner. The 

 vicinity of Sydney has furnished a large number of species; many 

 also come from Melbourne and the region round about. Mr. S. W. 

 Fulton has recently collected a most remarkable series of minute 

 bees at Purnong and Croydon, all new. These belong to Prosopid 

 genera, but simulate our American species of Perdita, and probably 

 have similar flower-visiting habits. One (Euryglossina sulphnrella 

 Ckll.) is light yellow like certain of our Perdita species, and presum- 

 ably visits some flower of that color; possibly, in Australia, it would 

 be some Mimosa-like plant. 



Australia (including Tasmania) is known to have 47 genera of 

 bees. This number would be increased if we added some of the 

 recent segregates, proposed principally by Perkins. The genera 

 Euprosopis and Gnatlwprosopis of Perkins seem distinct in their 

 typical members, and I have described species under them; but 

 a perfectly satisfactory dismemberment of Australian Protiopis 

 is hardly possible as yet. It cannot be doubted that eventually 

 both Prosopis and Euryglosm, as represented in Australia, will 

 i)(^ divided to form additional new genera. 



The Australian genera may be grouped as follows, the number 

 of species being given in each ca.se: 



(1) Endemic (Precinctive) genera: liiiujhntniclla (1). Pctra.sphecodes 

 (34), Pachyprosopi-s (12), Stilpno.soma (1), Mcroyloasa (15), 

 CnlloineliUa (2), Trichocolletes (1), (ioniocolletes (1), Cladocer- 

 apis (1), Andrenopsis (1), Phenacolleles (1), Anthoglossa (4), 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 29 



Turnerella (2), Eunjglossa (57), Euryglossina (8), Euryglos- 

 sella (1), Euryglossidia (2), Heterapis (3), Hylosoides (4), 

 Neopasiphae (1), Slenoiritus (2), Mellitidia (1), Gastropsis 

 (2), Melittosmithia (2), Neoceratina (1), Exoneura (10)/ 

 Lestis (2), Androgynella (1). It will be seen that these are 

 mainly Prosopid and Collet id bees. 



(2) Genus common to Australia and New Zealand, but not found 



elsewhere: ParacoUetes (70). 



(3) Genus common to Australia and the Austromalay Islands: 



Palceorhiza (12). 



(4) Genera widelj^ distributed over the Eastern Hemisphere, but not 



American: 

 (a) Genera with very distinct Australian species: Saropoda (2). 

 (6) Genera with Australian species closely allied to those of 



Asia: Allodape (4), Nomioides (1), Crocisa (11),^ Thmtmato- 



soma (1). 



(5) Genera widely di.stributed in the Eastern and Western Hemi- 



spheres : 

 (o) Genera with very distinct Australian species: Prosopis (95), 



Halidiis (55), in part, Megachile (89). 

 (6) Genera with Australian species closely allied to those of Asia: 



Sphecodes (1), Halidus (55), in part, Nomada (1), Nomia 



(36), Xylocopa (1), Anthophora (15), Lithurgus (3), Dianthi- 



dium (1), Ccelioxys (4), Trigona (8). 



By way of contrast, it is of interest to compare the bees of Formosa. 

 I recently studied a large collection from that island, and did not 

 find a single endemic genus or subgenus. 



Exoneura angophorae Cockerell. 



Females collected by H. Hacker at Sunnybank, Brisbane, Septem- 

 ber 12, 1911, represent extreme variations of this species, as follows: 



(a) Var. hackeri, nov. ; white clypeal band extremely broad, its 

 upper half broadest, and covering the whole width of the clypeus; 

 lateral face marks quite large, triangular; first three abdominal 

 segments with broad dusky bands, gently concave posteriorly, the 

 bands bending more or less cephalad at sides, ((^ueensl. Mus. 3.) 



(6) Var. obliterata, nov.; clypeal band dusky, narrow, very obscure; 

 no lateral marks; first abdominal segment nearly all black except 

 the hind margin (broadest in middle) and broad hind corners; 

 band on second segment reduced to three dusky patches; no band 

 on third. (Queensl. Mus. 1.) 



''The Syrian E. libanensis Friese belongs to Exoiieuridia Ckll., 1911. 

 ' Crocisa panlalon Dewitz, from Porto Rico, is said by Friese to belong to 

 Epeolus. 




30 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



These look like different species, but are apparently only extreme 

 variations of E. angophoroe, or perhaps a closely allied species, which 

 will take the name E. hackeri. 

 Exoneura hamulata Cockerell. 



The clj'peal mark in the females varies, and the best character 

 to distinguish this species from E. bicolor Smith is the broad face. 

 Mr. G. Aleade-Waldo has kindly compared my determination of 

 E. bicolor with Smith's type, and finds it correct (allowing for a 

 certain amount of variation in the clypeal stripe); he adds, "the 

 type has the face conspicuously narrowed below." I have received 

 E. hamulata labelled bicolor, and Friese evidently had hamulata 

 as bicolor, since in his description of E. froggattii he remarks that 

 bicolor has the inner orbits parallel. Females of hamulata before me 

 have the following data: Windsor, Victoria {French: Froggatt Coll. 

 161); no locality (Nat. Mus. Vict. 103); Armidale. N. S. W., Nov. 

 27, 1900 {Froggatt 163); Moss Bay, Dec. 13, 1893 {Froggatt 158). 



In Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., Oct., 1910, I described a male Exoneura, 

 evidently either bicolor or hamulata, I thought probably the latter. 

 I now conclude that it was bicolor, as I have before me a difl'erent 

 male (Stradbroke Island, Oct. 2, 1911, H. Hacker; Queensl. Mus. 2), 

 which seems to be hamulata. It is 8^ mm. long, with very red wings, 

 and differs from the male now supposed to be bicolor by the pale 

 face marking being confined to a large triangular cream-colored 

 clypeal patch, one side of which covers the upper end of the clypeus. 

 The first two abdominal segments and the middle of the third are 

 black. The flagellum is distinctlj' dark reddish. It would seem 

 from the large size and very red wings that this cannot be the male 

 of E. angophorce; yet it is a I'ather susjjicious circumstance that two 

 female Exoneura from Stradbroke Island, (^ueonsland (Sept. 27, 

 1906, Froggatt, 145, 201), belong to a large (7 mm. long) variety (it 

 E. angophoroe, having the characteristic abdominal markings of 

 the hackeri type; one has a narrow ferruginous clypeal stripe, the 

 other has it practically obsolete; there are no lateral marks. The 

 hair on the hind legs is reddish (more or less coppery) rather than 

 black. The inner orbits strongly converge below. These females 

 are certainly not bicolor, and of course they are entirely distinct 

 from hamulata; they arc, however, surely conspecific with the 

 Brisbane forms of angophonv. It is possible that thi> Brisbane 

 and Stradbroke Islam! forms represent a distiiK't new species, 

 which will then take th(> name E. hackeri. It reniains for local stu- 

 dents to decide this ciuestion.

Exoneura bicolor Smith. 



Females are labelled thus: King I., Tasmania (J. A. Kershaw,

 abdomen red without markings; head small; face wholly black; 

 labrum red; hair of hind tibiae and tarsi light red. 



Habitat —'^ew South Wales, Dec. 1, 1910 (Froggatt 108). I 

 had taken this for E. froggattii, and consequentl.y regarded the true 

 froggattii as new; but my specimen of E. froggattii, described below, 

 is one of the original lot and undoubtedly genuine. In Friese's 

 account, 27 Nov. should apparently read 27 July. 

 Exoneura fultoni n. sp. 



9. Length 5| mm.; head and thorax shining black (including 

 tubercles) ; none of the ordinary pale face-marks, but lower part 

 of clypeus broadly suffused with red; mandibles red except at base 

 and apex; legs bright chestnut-red, including femora; hair on outer 

 side of hind tibiae and tarsi dark fascous; wings dilute reddish, 

 stigma clear ferruginous; abdomen red, sometimes dusky at apex, 

 not at all banded. 



Habitat. — Croydon, Australia (S. W. Fulton; Xat. ^lus. \'ict. 

 238, and 176 in part). Readily known by the small size, red femora, 

 and absence of a cream-colored clypeal stripe. 



Exoneura froggattii Fric-sf. 



9. Length 6 mm.; head and thorax shining black; face narrow, 

 wholly without light markings; tubercles black; flagellum thick 

 reddish beneath; wings hyaline, slightly grayish, stigma and ner- 

 vures dusky red; femora black, red at apex; tibiae and tarsi bright 

 chestnut-red; abdomen rather slender, dusky apically, without bands; 

 hair on hiiul tibitc and tarsi entirely light red. 



Habitat. — Thornleigh, N. 8. W., "in cavity of Ethon gall," July 

 27, 1895 {Frpggatt 160). A specimen with reddish wings, apparently 

 a slight variety of this species, is from Croydon (Fulton; Nat. Mus. 

 Vict. 176 in part).

d^. Length about 65 mm.; black and bright lemon-yellow, the 

 thorax with thin, long pale hair; mesothorax, and the broad abdomen 

 above, black without markings. Very close to E. sinaprpefs Ckll., 

 with the description of which it agrees, except as follows: yellow*^ 

 mark on hind border of scutellum very small and inconspicuous!, 

 but a larger, conspicuous one on postscutellum, both marks inclined 

 to be divided into two; abdomen above pure black, the hind margins 

 of the segments smooth and shining (beneath, the abdomen is 

 much maculated with yellow, and this reaches the extreme sides of 

 segments 4 to 6); eyes pale gray; upper end of lateral face-marks 

 very broadly and obtusely rounded; flagellum pale orange-fulvous, 

 more dusky above with a dark mark above at base; mesothorax 

 shining; legs entirely j'ellow, except the ferruginous small joints of 

 tarsi; tegulse opaque light-yellow, with pellucid spot and anterior 

 margin; nervures and stigma dilute reddish sepia; first r.n. joining 

 second s.m. a short distance beyond its base. The marginal cell is 

 narrowly truncate. 



Habitat. — Purnong, S. Australia {S. W. Fulton; Nat. ^NIus. Vict. 

 147). 

 Euryglossa sanguinosa n. sp. 



9. Length a little over 8 mm., robust; heatl and thorax black, 

 with white hair, which is quite abundant on face and front, tubercles 

 and sides of metathorax; face without light markings; clypeus shining, 

 finely punctured; laljrum black; mandibles chestnut-red in middle; 

 flagellum bright ferruginous beneath except at ba.se; mesothorax 

 shining, minutely and densely punctured in front and at sides an- 

 teriorly, but on the disk with larger, sparse punctures; area of 

 metathorax shining; tegulse rufotestaceous ; wings hyaline, slightly 

 dusky; nervures and .stigma dark chestnut; lower side of first s.m. 

 strongly arched; .second s.m. long, receiving first r.n. a considerable 

 distance from base; legs dark rufous, the .small joints of tarsi light 

 ferruginous; h'nd .spur coarsely pectinate; abdomen broad, dullish, 

 with a sericeous lustre; first three segments dark green, with the 

 hind margins broadly dark reddish; remaining .segments clear ferru- 

 ginous, the fourth with a dusky shade at sides; venter dark to middle 

 of fourth segment. 




36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Habitat. — Windsor, Victoria (French; Froggatt Coll. 188). Super- 

 ficially like a miniature E. hcemaiura Ckll., but the eyes converge 

 below, and the sculpture of the sides of the mesothorax in front 

 is quite different. Also related to E. terminata Smith, but dis- 

 tinguished by the green abdomen, with the fourth as well as the 

 fifth segment red. Also related to E. salaris Ckll., but differing 

 in color and sculpture. 

 Euryglossa ruberrima a. sp. 



9. Length about 8 mm., verj- robust; bright terra-cotta red, 

 with the head and pleura black; mandibles black; antennae ferru- 

 ginous beneath, dark above; mesothora.x large and convex, with 

 strong sparse punctures; metathorax black at sides, po.steriorly 

 and extreme base; abdomen with conspicuous but suffused blue- 

 black transverse shades on fourth and fifth segments, and very slight 

 dusky shades on first to third; apex with fuscous hair; legs red, 

 including coxae and trochanters, but anterior femora piceous except 

 beneath and at extreme apex, middle femora largely darkened, 

 especially behind; hind legs entirely clear red; tegulae rufous; wings 

 strongly reddened. A species of the E. rubricata group ; in my table 

 in Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., Aug., 1910, p. 167, it runs to E. rubricata 

 Sm., from which it differs by the dusky, reddened wings, the mandi- 

 bles black with only a red subapical spot, the metathorax largely 

 red, the tegulae dark reddish, and the base of the abdomen entirely 

 red. Compared with E. frenchii Ckll., it differs by the very strongly, 

 though not very densely, puncturefl clj^jeus and supraclypeal 

 area, the suture between them wholly dark, the entirely red hind 

 femora, and the apex of abdomen darkened, the dusky color of the 

 fifth segment leaving a pair of rather poorly defined transversely 

 oval red spots. From E. leptosperyni Ckll. it differs by the color 

 of the wings, the larger head, the facial fove;p not at all turned 

 mesad at upper end, the more sparsely punctured mesothorax, the 

 second r.n. reaching second s.m. a little more distant from its apex 

 than the first from its base. 



//fl6/7fl^— Victoria, 1910 {Froggatt, 149). It also carries a label 

 with number 1418. 

 Pachyprosopis haematoatoma n. sp. 



9. Length about 6 mm.; rather robust, Init head not enlarged; 

 head, thorax, and abdomen shining dark blue; labruin and greater 

 part of mandibles red; flagellum bright ferruginous iieneath; cheeks 

 broad; mesothorax with very sparse, excessively feeble and minute 

 punctures; area of metathorax smooth and shining: sides of meta-

thorax with thin pale hair: tegulse black in front, dark red-!)ro^\^^ 

 behind; wings rather small, clear; b.n. very strongly arched, not 

 nearly meeting t.m. ; first r.n. entering first s.m. some distance 

 before its end; second s.m. very narrow, greatly produced above, 

 to an acute angle; legs pieeous, slightly metallic, the anterior femora 

 quite blue; anterior knees, tibiae, and tarsi, and all the other tarsi, 

 bright ferruginous red; abdomen feebly sculptured; pygidial plate 

 very narrow. 



Habitat.— Croydon, Au.stralia, 2 9 (S. W. FuIton.-'Sat. Mus. Vict. 

 236). Quite unique by the uniform dark blue color of the body. 

 Fachyprosopis atromicans n. sp. 



9. Length about .5 mm.; shining black, with very little hair; 

 tibiae and tarsi bright ferruginous, as also are the knees, extending 

 into a more or less defined stripe on the middle and hind femora; 

 abdomen broad, the lateral hind margins of the segments (especially 

 the second and third) more or less broadly reddish; mandibles with a 

 ferruginous subapical band; clypeus brilliantly shining, with sparse 

 distinct punctures; scape shining Itlack; flagellum short and thick, 

 clear ferruginous beneath; head not enlarged; mesothorax brilliantl.y 

 shining, sparsely punctured; scutellum shining and punctured, but 

 postscutellum granular and dull; area of metathorax shining, 

 except at extreme base; tegulse rufous; wings hyaline, .stigma dilute 

 sepia, nervures paler, basal nervure yellow; second s.m. broad, 

 but the outer upper angle proiluced as in Pachyprosopis: recurrent 

 nervures entering second s.m. near base and apex, the first" sometimes 

 meeting the t.c, but the second always away from extreme apex 

 of cell; claws with an inner tooth far from tip; hind spur with long 

 spines; abdomen microscopically transversely lineolate. 



cf. Length about 4^ mm.; like the female, but the thick Hagel- 

 lum is elongated; face wholly black, with thin but cons])icuous 

 white hair; red on femora more extended; last two abdoniinal seg- 

 ments clear red. 



Habitat. — Purnong, near Murray R., S. Australia. 2 9 , 1 cf (N. W. 

 Fulton; Nat. Mus. Vict. 232, 220, 226); Croydon, Au.-itralia, 19 

 {S. W. Fulton; Nat. Mus. Vict. 193). The type is a female from 

 Purnong. Intermediate between Eui-ijglo.s.m and Paclnjpro.'<opis; 

 resembling in many ways Euryglossa neglectida Ckll., but especially 

 related to Pachyprosopi-'i nitidicep-'' Ckll., from which it is known 

 by thQ shining mesothorax, red tibiie, etc. 

 Frosopis asinella n. sp. 



cf. Length about 5 nun.; black, with the face (lateral marks

reaching sides of front), broail short mandibles, the thick flattened 

 scape and second antenna! joint in front, all pale yellow; upper 

 border of prothorax, tubercles, anterior and middle femora, apices 

 of hind femora, and all the tibiae and tarsi, bright lemon-yellow; 

 scutellura entirely black; face rather narrow, entirely pale up to 

 level of antennae, supraclypeal area oval with a truncate base, 

 lateral face-marks ending above in an oblique-sided lobe, the tip 

 of which is on orbital margin al)0ut the level of middle of front ; 

 front and thoracic dorsum dull, extremely minutely punctured: 

 tegulse with a light spot; wings clear, stigma and nervures dark 

 bro^\Ti; first r.n. entering apical corner of first s.m. or meeting first 

 t.c. (these alternatives represented by the opposite wings of the 

 tjTJe); abdomen short and broad, dullish, very finely punctured, 

 wliolly without ventral tubercles; flagellum pale ferruginous beneath. 



Habitat. — Purnong, S. Australia (S. W. Fulto)i; Nat. I\Ius. Vict., 

 197). In my table of Australian Pivsopis {Ann. Mag. Xat. Hist., 

 Feb., 1910) this runs to P. priinulipicta Ckll., but differs from that 

 by the much narrower and paler face, wholly yellow hind tibise, etc. 

 From other sjiecies it is known by the small size, yellow legs and 

 non-tuberculate abdomen. According to the character of the 

 mandibles and scape, P. a.9inella falls in the genus Gnathopro.tnpis 

 Perkins. 

 Frosopis minnscula n. sp. 



cT. Length about 45 mm., very slender, especially' the abdomen, 

 which has the dorsal suture between the first and second segments 

 constricted; black, with the following parts yellow (reddened by 

 cyanide in type), mandibles, labrum, the long clypeus, lateral face- 

 marks shaped like feet on tiptoe (convex and extremely shiny), 

 tubercles, small marks on upper margin of prothorax, apical jiart 

 of coxae, trochanters, knees, stripe on anterior femora behind and 

 short one in front, anterior and middle tibise (latter with a blackish 

 spot behind) and less than l)asal half of hind tibiie; the supraclyjieal 

 area, scutella, etc., are black, and the combination of black femora 

 with yellow trochanters is very peculiar; scape yellow in front, not 

 swollen; flagellum long, light fulvous Ijeneath; wings clear, nervures 

 and the large stigma dark brown; first r.n. meeting first t.c; second 

 •s.m. about a.s high as long; abdomen subclavate, broadest near the 

 end. The abdomen is rather coar.sely transversely lineolate. 



Hnhitat.— Croydon, Victoria (.S. W. Fulton: Nat. Mus. A'ict. 195). 

 Runs in my table nearest to P. primiilipicta, which has a much 

 broader face, dark trochanters, etc. 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 39 



Prosopis vittatifrons n. sp. 



9 . Length about 41 mm., rather slender; head and thorax 

 bhick, with the followmg parts cream-color: mandibles, labrum, 

 clypeus, a broadly triangular supraclj-peal mark, lateral face-marks 

 (extending broadly up to beginning of facial fovea, then continued 

 for a short distance as a very fine line between fovea and ej-e), 

 a broad band on each cheek behind eye, and elongate mark on front; 

 tubercles, with extension to upper margin of prothorax, white; 

 tegulse pellucid; legs pale ferruginous, the hind ones a little stained 

 with dusky; abdomen with the first two segments clear ferruginous, 

 the others dark brown, the hmd margins of the third and fourth 

 more or less pallid, or the first two segments may each have a pair 

 of large brown blotches, with the third ferruginous, crossed and 

 largelj^ covered by a large dark cloud; face broad; antennae light 

 ferruginous beneath; mesothorax dullish, microscopically tessellate 

 and punctured: wings hyaline, faintly dusky, stigma and nervures 

 dark brown; the two recurrent nervures meeting the transverso- 

 cubitals; second s.m. a little higher than broad. 



cf. Length a little over 3 mm.; face light yellow (primrose- 

 color) up to level of antennae, with an elongate frontal mark as in 

 female, the lateral marks shaped like a hand with the index-finger 

 pointed; first abdominal segment dark brown, pale ferruginous 

 apically, second the same, the broad red band notched on each side 

 in front, the second segment also red basally; remaining segments 

 dark. 



//a^i/a/.— Purnong, S. Australia, 2 9, 2cf (S. W. Fulton; Nat. 

 Mus. Vict. 221, 213, 145). The type is a female. Runs in my table 

 to P. constrida Ckll., but is easily known by the elongate frontal 

 mark in both sexes; the male constrida has the clypeus, etc., white 

 instead of yellow. 

 Prosopis mediovirens u. sp. 



9. Length 45-45 mm.; head and thorax dark green, dullish, 

 very finely sculptured, with the following parts creamy-white or 

 pinkish-white; labrum, mandibles, clypeus (except a rather broad 

 dark band down each side, not reaching lower margin), broadly 

 triangular supraclypcal mark, lateral marks (continued as a band 

 above to beginning of facial fovcae), small mark on lower part of 

 checks, tubercles and an interrupted line on upper margin of i)ro- 

 thorax; no frontal mark, no light mark on scutellum ; antcnna> ])ale 

 ferruginous beneath; tegulae hyaline, with a white spot; wings clear, 

 the large stigma dark brown, nervures paler; b.n. nearly reaching 




40 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



t.ni.; recurrent nervures meeting transversocuhitals; second s.m. 

 a little broader than high; legs very pale yellow or pinkish-white, 

 hind femora dark behind except apically, hind tarsi dark at apex; 

 abdomen piceous, with the hind margin of first segment broadly 

 (notched in front sublaterally), of the second narrowly, and the 

 base of the third, ferruginous; hind margin of third segment more or 

 less pallid. 



cf . Length 85 mm.; light colors of face, prothora.x and legs clear 

 lemon-yellow; face entirely yellow up to level of antennae: supraclypeal 

 mark larger, but upper extension of lateral marks formed as in female; 

 scape yellow in front, not swollen; flagcllum light orange-fulvous 

 beneath; legs bright yellow, but the hind legs peculiarly marked, 

 the femora with the apical two-fifths brown in front, the tibije with 

 nearly the apical half (except a minute apical spot) very dark browii, 

 the tarsi dark except at base; abdomen with two very broad fulvous 

 bands, each notched on each side in front; venter fulvous. 



Habitat. — Purnong, S. Australia, 59, 2cf {S. W. Fulton: Nat. 

 Mus. Vict. 227, 161,. 215, 235, 230). In my table it runs to 5, and 

 there forms a new section, with mesothorax green. In spite of the 

 different coloration, it seems nearer to P. vitlatifrons than to any other 

 described species. The type is a female. 

 Prosopis ohlorosoma n. sp. 



9 . Length hardly 4^ mm.; head and thorax dark green, varying 

 to black with a greenish tint, scutellum and postscutellum black; 

 the following parts are light yellow (reddened by cyanide in types); 

 clypeus except a broad band on each side, not reaching lower margin 

 (hence the light area on clypeus is like a tall hat with the brim 

 turned down); broadly triangular supraclypcal mark; lateral face- 

 marks, forming a band which extends as far as facial fovea?; basal 

 half of mandibles (but not labrum); interrujitcd line on upper border 

 of prothorax, and tubercles. Tegula; hyaline with a yellow spot; 

 wings clear, the large stigma and the nervures dark reddish-brown; 

 b.n. nearly reaching t.m.; recurrent nervures meeting transverso- 

 cubitafs, or first r.n. just reaching basal corner of second s.m.; 

 second s.m. about as high as broad; femora black, with the knees 

 broadly yellow; tibia; and tarsi yellow; abdomen black. Mesothorax 

 dullish, very finely sculptured. Antennie pale fulvous l)eneath. 



Habitat. — Croydon, Australia, 7 9 (-S". H'. Fulton; Nat. Mus. Vict. 

 192, 191). In my table this runs to P. alboniten.s Ckll., a very differ- 

 ent species, with blue abdomen. This cannot well be tiie female 

 of P. minuscula. Both have a minutely cancellate area of metathorax, 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 41 



but in minuscula the sculpture is deeper, giving a finely pitted effect ; 

 P. minuscula also lacks the green color, and has the b.n. considerably 

 more remote from the t.m. 

 Frosopis scintilliformis n. sp. 



9. Length about 4i mm.; black, much less robust than P. 

 chlorosoma, the abdomen especially much narrower; head round, 

 the face broad; mandibles pale yellowish, but labrum dark; face- 

 marks confined to a rather narrow yellow band along each inner 

 orbit, reaching a little above level of antennae; flagellum clear 

 ferruginous beneath; tubercles, ^nd an inconspicuous interrupted 

 line on upper border of prothorax, yellow; legs black, with the 

 knees, anterior tibiae in front, base of middle tibiae and nearly' half 

 of hind tibiae, as well as all the basitar.si, yellow; wings practically 

 as in P. chlorosoma, except that first r.n. enters extreme apical corner 

 of first s.m.; thorax dullish, the microscopical sculpture peculiar, 

 the mesothorax and scutellum having a fine but deeply cut tessel- 

 lation and scattered punctures; area of metathorax microscopically 

 coarsely cancellate. 



Habitat. — Croydon, Australia, 1 9 , mounted on a card with three 

 P. chlorosoma (S. W. Fulton; Nat. Mus. Vict. 192j. In my table 

 this runs near to P. ainicula Sm., a much larger and otherwise 

 different species. It is rather to be compared with the minute 

 P. scintilla Ckll., from which it is readily knoA\ii by the light tubercles, 

 etc. I suspect that it may be the female of P. minuscula, but with- 

 out better evidence of this it seems best to regard it as distinct. 

 Frosopis xanthosphaera n. sp. 



9. Length almost 10 mm.; robust, black, the abdomen faintly 

 greenish, especially toward the apex; markings on head and thorax 

 brilliant chrome-yellow, as follows: a large broad patch on each side 

 of face, shaped something like a turtle's head in profile, obliquely 

 truncate above, verj^ obtusely pointed below; tubercles broadly 

 (but no patch behind); a large round patch on scutellum ami jiost- 

 scutellum, crossed by a black (sutural) line. Mandibles broad, 

 tridcndate at apex; clypeus flattened and minutely roughen(>d in 

 middle, distinctly but not densely punctured; antennae entirely 

 black; front and vertex with coarse black hair; mesothorax dullish, 

 .strongly and rather closely punctured; area of metathorax with 

 about the basal third very coarsely corrugated, in (•onii)lete contrast 

 with the rest, which is without evident sculpture; tegulie black, 

 punctured anteriorly; wings hyaline, very faintly dusky; b.n. 




42 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



only gently arched, nearly reaching t.m.: first r.n. entering extreme 

 basal corner of second s.m., which is elongate, much broader than 

 high; legs black, partlj- ornamented with silvery-white hair, last 

 joint of anterior tarsi reddened; abdomen shining with rather small 

 but strong punctures, apex with black hair. 



Habitat. — King Island, Tasmania {J. A. Kershaw; Vict. Xat. iSIus. 

 206). Runs in my table to P. rotundiceps Sm., but the head is not 

 round, the flagellum is black, and the abdomen is not minutely 

 and closely punctured. 



Frosopis leucosphsera n. sp. 



9 . Length a little over 9 mm.; robust, black, with the abdomen 

 obscurely dark bluish; clypeus wholly black, dullish, with very 

 shallow punctures; lateral face-marks a sort of dilute orange, large, 

 cuneiform, obtuse below, somewhat obiiquely l^roadly truncate 

 above, antennae black, the flagellum with a contrasting bright 

 ferruginous stripe beneath; lower part of front broadly elevated 

 in middle; vertex with coarse black hair; mesothorax strongly and 

 quite den.sely punctured; tubercles cream-color; a large circular 

 cream-colored patch on scutellum and postscutellum, crossed by a 

 black (sutural) line; area of metathorax coarsely corrugatecl at base; 

 teguliie black, punctured in front; wings hyaline, very faintly dusky; 

 first r.n. entering ba.sal corner of the long second s.m.; legs and 

 abdomen essentially as in P. xanthosphcera, but punctures of second 

 abdominal segment smaller and closer. 



Habitat. — Croydon, Australia (S. W. Fulton; Nat. ^lus. \'ict. 

 167J. Closely related to P. xaiithosphcei-a , differing not only in 

 color of the markings, but also in the finer punctures of the second 

 abdominal segment. In my table of Prosopis it can be run to 12 

 or to 38, ruiming out at either place because of the cream-colored 

 patch on the scutella. 



Frosopis chromatica (Cockerell). 



Stradbroke Island (//. Hacker; Queensl. Mus. 66). One male 

 taken Oct. 2, 1911. 

 Frosopis haematopoda u. sp. 



9. Length about 7 nun.; tile-red and black, like /'. lateralis 

 Smith, of which it may be a subspecies. It differs from lateralis 

 by the lateral face-marks, which are orange instead of white; and 

 the femora entirelj- red, as al.so the middle and hind trochanters. 

 Tiljiffi and tarsi entirely red; metathorax entirelj' dull black, the 

 area roughened, and shaped like the profile of a cup; first r.n.

Prosopis proxima Smith, var. a. 



A female from Purnong, S. Australia {S. W. Fulton; Nat. Mus. 

 Vict. 148j dilTers a little from the type in having the lateral face- 

 marks white without any trace of yellow, and the hind tibiae with a 

 dull white mark at base. The tubercles have the apical half white, 

 and there are two white marks on the prothorax above. The 

 axillae are red. 

 Prosopis ohrysognatha Cockerell. 



A male from Frankston, Victoria (T. Kershaw, Dec, 1902; Nat. 

 Mus. Vict. 160) seems to have the faintest possible bluish tint 

 on the abdomen, so faint, that it is difficult to be sure of it. If 

 run in my table among the species with metallic abdomen, it goes 

 straight to P. cognata Sm., which is evidently very closely allied. 

 Smith's cognata is from Champion Bay and Swan River, and has a 

 dark blue abdomen. The female described by Smith is to be con- 

 sidered the tj'pe. I have described the female of chrysognatha, 

 and it is not identical with cogn(*ta.

 Euprosopis nodosicorais n. sp. 



cf . Length 6 mm. or a little over, like E. elegans var. sydneyana 

 (Ckll.), with the postscutellum broadly yellow, but differing thus: 

 malar space longer; its length 270 microns; the bright ferruginous 

 flagellum with the last four joints thick, with large irregular tubercles 

 above, the three before these subtuberculate. The abdomen has 

 the first two segments and the sides of the third red, the first segment 

 with a diamontl-shaped dusky discal mark. The sides of the meso- 

 thorax are broaiUy j'ellow. Stigma bright ferruginous.

One adult from St. Louis, Missouri, and another from Kiskiminitas

Genus AMBLODON Rafinesque. 



This name is allowed to supersede Ictiobus Rafinesque, now largely 

 in use. Amhlodon is Vjased on two species, Amblodon bitbalus Rafin- 

 esque and Amblodon niger Rafinesque. Jordan and Gilbert have 

 designated Amblodon bubahts Rafinesque ( = in part Aplodinotus grun- 

 niens Rafinesque) as the type,^ and thus Amblodon would become 

 a synonym of Aplodinotus according to their ruling. However, 

 as Amblodon bubalus Rafinesque, the type species of Amblodon 

 Rafinesque, applies primarily to the small-mouthed buffalo, I 

 cannot accept their contention. 



MEGASTOM.\TOBUS subgen. nov. 

 Type Sclerognalkus cyprinella Valenciennes. 

 Mouth large, oblique, terminal, and upper lip about level with 

 lower edge of e\-e. Lips thin, nearly smooth. Pharyngeals weak. 

 This name is proposed for the large-mouthed buffaloes as Sclerog- 

 nathus Valenciennes, usually attributed to them, has Catostomus 

 cyprinus Le Sueur (its first species) designated as the type by Jordan 

 and Gilbert." and is thus a synonym of Carpiodes Rafinesque.

Also three others from the Wabash River; two from Calhoun, 

 one from Brownsville, and one from St. Joseph, Missouri; one from 

 the Platte River, Nebraska; one without data. 



This species has never been recorded from Pennsylvania, as it 

 is not mentioned by Cope, and Bean includes it as hj'pothetieal. 

 Its admission to this fauna is now certain, as two examples from the 

 Beaver River, secured by Cope in 1880, are before me. As it is 

 said to be an inhabitant of our larger western streams or rivers, 

 seldom entering the smaller ones, its extinction, if not already 

 accomplished, is very likely inevitable in western Penns\'h-ania. 

 Carpiodes thompsoni Agassiz 



One from Lake Erie and another from Saginaw Bay, JNIichigan. 



I secured an example at Erie, Pennsylvania, on July 5th, 1907, 

 besides examining several others at this place the same time. These 

 examples are the basis of the only positive record for this species 

 in Pennsylvania limits. 

 Carpiodes oyprinns (Le Sueur). 



S('\on exaniples from the Conestoga Creek in Lancaster County, 

 Pennsylvania. It is known to the fisherman at Octoraro, Cono- 

 wingo, and Bald Friar, along the Susquehanna in Maryland, usually 

 as "white carp" or "Susquehanna carp."

Known only from the type. Though united with Carpiodes 

 difformis by some ^\Titers, it is evidently a distinct species, as pointed 

 out by its describer. It differs chiefly in the position of the mouth, 

 which opens in front anterior to the nostrils, though its peculiar 

 snub-nosed physiognomy is verj- suggestive of Carpiodes difformis. 

 Carpiodes velifer (Rafinesque). 



One from the Wabash River, Indiana, and another from the 

 Blue River, Indiana?. 



Two examples from the Youghiogheny River, secured by Cope, 

 are the basis of the first definite record for the species in that stream 

 in Pennsylvania.

This appears to be a distinct species, and not at all identical 

 with Carpiodes thompsoni, as suggested by some writers. Its 

 aflBnities are with Carpiodes difformis and Carpiodes cuti.sanserinus, 

 a.s pointed out by Cope.

Cope's reference to Klamath Lake material as Catostoitnts labiatus^ 

 cannot refer to the.^e specimens. He later states that his largest 

 example is twelve inches long, and gives the following points at 

 variance: "Scales, 10 — 74 — 11; radii D. i, 11; \. 10; head 4.5 times 

 in length; eye 5.5 in head." 



Prof. Snyder has kindly examined two typical examples in Stan- 

 ford University. They are from the upper Klamath Lake. He 

 writes as follows: "Scales in lateral line, to end of last vertebra, 

 74 — 72; scales on base of caudal, beyond the above 3 — 3; scales 

 between isthmus and origin of ventral, about 40 in one example. 

 The last count is doubtful on account of irregularity in the rows 

 and the poor preservation of the specimens."

Three from Utah Lake (E. D. Cope m 1882), Utah. In the 

 original account of Chasmistes Jordan,' Catostomus fecundtts Cope

 sufficient for an a priori claim to the definition. The latter was 

 afterwards pointed out to refer to the present genus, with Chasmistes 

 liorus Jordan as its tjT)e.' Chasmistes liorus Jordan was also con- 

 fused originally by its describer' with Catostomus fecuiidus Cope and 

 Yarrow. Though this latter species is correctly allowed in Catos- 

 tomus, possiblj- Chasmistes may stand as a distinct subgenus, being 

 distinguishable from the others by its pointed snout above. In 

 any case Chasmistes brevirostris Cope cannot be included with it,

than in Deltistes. Gilbert mentions two Klamath Lake species 

 of Chasmistes. Chasmistes stomias Gilbert'- "has a larger, deeper 

 heacl, with larger, more obliquelj' placed mouth, and conspicuously 

 protruding premaxillary spines." The scales are 76 to 82, and thus 

 this nominal form appears more clearly identical with Chasmistes 

 brei'irostris than the form he lists under that name." Chasmistes 

 copei Evermann and Meek" has 80 scales, and is said to differ from 

 Chasmistes stomias Gilbert in "its larger head, larger, more oblique 

 mouth, less prominent snout, and verj' small fins. The differences 

 in the fins are very great, particularly in the ventrals." In the 

 case of Gilbert's figure of Chasmistes stomias a spawning-fish is shown, 

 thus the ventrals and anal are unusually long. Chasmistes chamber- 

 laini Rutter '= agrees with all the forms of Lipomyzon, so far as known, 

 in having the lower lip united at the mandibular symphysis, and 

 differs in having 93 scales.

"Colorado and New Rivers." Dr. J. L. Le Conte. In locating this 

 interesting dried example, it is now possible to give its correct 

 place among the catostomoids after fifty-two years of oblivion 

 and erroneous identification. It is unquestionably identical with 

 Catostomus cypho Lockington, which was also described in these 

 Proceedings twenty years later,'" and Lockington's specific name 

 is the one adopted by all writers, as it was thought to have been the 

 first ever given to thi.s peculiar fish. Jordan says"' "Catostomus 

 texanus Abbott is less clear [than Catostomus chloropteron Abbott], 

 but what there is of specific characterization in the description 

 points to C. teres. The dorsal carination is frequently observed 

 in stuffed fishes in which some flesh is left in the back to shrink in 

 drying, leaving the back 'carinated.'" These entirely erroneous 

 suggestions were made, of course, shortly before the species was 

 supposed to have been discovered by Locking-ton. Still further 

 confusion is added by its inclusion as a synonym of Moxostoma 

 congestu7n (Baird and Girard) by Jordan and Evermann.'* The 

 specific name texanus is unfortunate, as the species is not known 

 from Texas. It appears to have been given under the impression 

 that the Colorado River of that State was intended, together with 

 the New River being likely confused with the Neuces River?. 



Besides the above example is another specimen from the Hardy 

 River in Lower California, secured by Mr. S. N. Rhoads in Februarj' 

 of 1905. It is important as showing to what extent variation 

 may reach in the species. It has 86 scales in the lateral line to the 

 caudal base, and 5 more on the latter. The type shows 73 scales 

 in the lateral line to the caudal base and 4 more on the latter. As 

 both are adult examples, it would appear hardly likely that Xyrauchen 

 imcompfwgre Jordan and Evermann is a distinct species, as it is 

 said to have but 81 scales, with other characters apparently varietal 

 or due to age.

 Rio in Texas, and one from Hartford in Arkansa.s. The last, a very 

 young example, I wrongly identified as Catostomus nigricans.^^ 



Forbes and Richardson statc^ that this species ranges on "the 

 Atlantic Slope from New Jersey to North Carolina," though there 

 is no evidence whatever of its occurrence in New Jersey, so far as 

 I know of. Further, in view of the lack of detail, the single record 

 for its occurrence in the Su.squchanna River basin may also be 

 questioned.

 latter had Placopharynx. Moxostoma duquesnei is thus seen to have 

 more numerous scales in the lateral line than mast of the species 

 of the genus. Other small-scaled nominal species, as Moxostoma 

 lesueurii (Richardson)^ and Moxostoma alleghaniensis Nichols," 

 are either identical or very clo.sely allied.

NOTES ON THE FISHES OF THE CHINCOTEAGUE REGION OF VIRGINIA. 

 BY HENRY W. FO^'LER. 



Early in May of 1912 I visited the town of Chincoteague, where 

 nearly a week was spent studying and collecting fishes for the 

 Academy. Though many of the species met with were abundant, 

 we secured some of interest, and are thus able to offer in this con- 

 tribution the first fairly representative account of the fish-fauna 

 of the region. 



Chincoteague Island is situated at the lower end of the bay of that 

 name, forming in fact the lower inner face of the great, narrow, sandy 

 barrier-beach of Assateague Island, which is now, however, entirely 

 continuous withOceanCity in Maryland and northward. This barrier- 

 beach, at least north of Assateague Inlet, contains no permanent fresh 

 water its entire extent, or for a distance of about thirty miles. Thus 

 Chincoteague Island, its area extending a little over eight miles north 

 and south, with its greatest width a little over a mile, contains the 

 greatest amount of fresh water to be found in this off-shore region. 

 This is in the form of narrow sloughs or ponds, extending north and 

 south, and usually shallow. They are locally kno\TO as glades, and are 

 often broken up in places into smaller bodies of water. The larger 

 glades frequently contain purely fresh water throughout the year, 

 though in places they sometimes dry out through drought or other 

 causes. In color the water is usually dark, still, and sluggish, the 

 first character likely due to the numerous bull pines which grow 

 in many places. Such waters naturally support an abundance 

 of life, as minute Crustacea, etc., especially in the pools destitute 

 of fishes. Sometimes a fresh-water glade will be separated from 

 a brackish one having direct egress to the sea, and at the time of 

 high tides the two waters are intermingled. In only one pool of 

 fresh water, though separated by but a few feet of dry land from 

 a brackish-water glade, did we secure fresh-water mollusca and 

 a phyllopod (Iiw holmani). This pool was also quite interesting 

 as differing from many others examined, in the great diversity of 

 its animal life, such as water a.sels, fresh-water amphipods, larval 

 dragon-flies, water-striders, and water-boatmen. We did not find 

 Palamianetes vulgaris in this locality, though it was common in other 




62 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



pools on the island, as well as on Assateague. On the latter and on 

 Wallops Island we only found minute Crustacea, and no fresh-water 

 mollusks. The Chincoteague mollusca were identified by Mr. E. G. 

 \'anatta as Lymncea columella, Planorhis alabamensis and Miiscu- 

 lium partumeivm. The only frog met with was Rana pipiena, 

 and these mostly greenish. Bufo americanus was abundant, and we 

 also saw a number of Chelydra serpcntitia. Kinosternon pensylranicuin 

 and Chrysemys pida.

 Those were usually found hanging from the back and protruding 

 through holes they had bored through their host's flesh. Some 

 were found protruding from the dorsal fins, and one which had im- 

 bedded its head under its host's tongue hung down from the chin 

 like a bifurcated barbel. Among fifty or more (>xamples of men- 

 haden, but few were found free of this parasite, and usually several 

 were on a single fish.

Mngil curema \'alenciennp.s. 



Young found in brackish pools and ditches on Assateague. 

 Gasterosteus aculeatus I.innspus. 



First found on Assateague in a large open glade, filled with duck- 

 weed for several miles in extent. These little fish were found swarm- 

 ing in myriads, and were uniformly about an inch in length. 

 Some had their ventral membranes bright crimson, and many 

 were slightly variable otherwi.se in color, though most were 

 more or less brassy or golden. All which we secured were 

 of the mailed type. A.ssociated were a few silversides, killifish, 

 rain-water fish, and pursy minnows. The sticklebacks often swim 

 in immense schools and take refuge in the duck grass when disturbed. 

 They are much condemned by persons living on the island who 

 raise ducks, as they are .said to cause the death of the young birds 

 in some numbers at times. One man told me he had lost thirty- 

 two young ducks one season, due to the birds swallowing small 

 sticklebacks. Many other complaints were also heard. It seems 

 that in the .summer or during drought the small fishes congregate 

 in shallow puddles and being then easily captured they are eagerly 

 devoured by the young ducks. The fish, finding itself a captive, 

 immediately assumes its only defense by locking tightly its

 pipe with fatal effect. 



On Chincoteague they were far less abundant.

SOME TYPE-SPECIMENS OF THE AMERICAN CYPRINOID FISHES OF THE 



GENUS EUTILTJS. 



BY HEXRY AV. FOWLER. 



While studying the cyprinoid fi.^hes in the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia recently, a number of detailed notes were 

 made on the variation found in the genus Rutilus. The material 

 embraces a number of tj-pical specimens of the American species, 

 most of which have not been critically examined since they were 

 described. Owing to the imperfect nature of the incomplete and 

 unsatisfactory original descriptions, it is hoped that the present 

 contribution will be of value. Few, if any, of the species have been 

 figured, and certainlj- not from these specimens. 



In searching for sufficient characters to separate the American 

 from the European species generically, I have been unsuccessful. 

 Most of the former show no scaly axillary ventral flaps, though 

 a few exceptions were noted. All the Old World species have this 

 character very evident, as represented in the collection, the pointed 

 scale appearing quite coaspicuous. Therefore, while ^flJlole'ucus 

 (or Leucos) may eventually be found subgenerically distinct, the 

 elevation of Siphateles to generic rank by Cockerell' would seem 

 hardly warranted solely on scale characters.

NOTES ON SOME WEST AMERICAN CEPHALOPODS. 

 BY S. STILLMAN BERRY. 



As a considerable time has elapsed since the completion of the 

 manuscript for my recent Review of the CephaJopods of Western 

 North America, it is not surprising that several new facts have been 

 brought to notice, while some of those already dwelt upon appear to 

 require reconsideration in the light of recent work by other in- 

 vestigators. Hence the following notes. 



Polypus apoUyon Berry 1912. 



It seems fairly doubtful whether all the specimens included with 

 the type of this species in the table of locality data in my report 

 (Berry, 1912a, p. 283) are in reality conspecific with one another 

 or belong to recognizable groups which only a greater abundance 

 of well-preserved adult material than is at present available will 

 enable us to separate. In the meanwhile I am inclined to recognize 

 P. apollyon as distinct from the true P. hongkongensin Hoyle, 

 a view which, if correct, eliminates the latter species from considera- 

 tion in our fauna. 



Fig. 1. — Polypus apollyon, outline drawing of funnel laid open along the nuMlio- 

 ventrai line to expose the funnel organ. X 2. [S. S. B. 81.) 



I take this op|)ortunity to give a figure of the funnel organ 

 of one of the specimens from tlic Coronado Islands in the collection 

 of the University of California [S. S. B. 81]. 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 73 



Polypus pricei new species. 



Animal small and rattier delicate. Body elongate pjTiform, 

 obtusely pointed behind; a decided nuchal constriction separates 

 it from the head; surface everywhere smooth, without visible cirri 

 or papillae. 



Head small, short, flattened, slightly narrower than the body. 

 Eyes very large, rounded, and protruding. Funnel broad, thin 

 walled, truncate at the extremity, the tip reaching but little past 

 the base of the arms.' 



Fig. 2. — Polypus pricei, inner aspect of right ventral arm. X 2^. [S. S. B. 189.] 



Arms nearly equal, scarcely twice as long as the body; thick 

 at the base, but delicate and tapering rather rapidly to a tenuous 

 extremity; connected at base by a thin hyaline umbrella extending 

 about equally between them all for perhaps a twelfth of their length; 

 along their outer margins it is continued as a very fragile membrane, 

 becoming oljsolete considerably before it reaches the tips. Suckers 

 small, little crowded, much elevated, the fir.st five or six pairs but 

 little displaced, so that they still have the appearance of a single row; 

 the remainder clearly biserial (fig. 2). 



Hectocotjdus not observed. 



Color of .specimens preserved in alcohol a very pale brownish- 

 buff everywhere except the region of the eyeball, the body and 

 head irregularly dotted with small brown chromatophores; eyeball 

 bluish-black, with a few very large chromatophores superimposed; 

 two alternating longitudinal rows of large light colored chromato- 

 phores decorate the outer surface of each arm. 



' Owing to the condition of the specimens I am unable to give either a drawing 

 or an accurate description of the funnel organ. The indieation.s are, however, 

 that it is closely similar in outline to that of I', catifiirnicus (cf. Berry U)12a, 

 p. 286, fig. 3j, although relatively somewhat smaller and more anterior in position.

Type Locality. — Off Point Pinos, Monterey Bay, California; 

 four specimens from the stomach of a salmon {Onchorhynchus 

 tschawytscha); C. H. Gilbert, June 23, 1911. 



Distribution. — Although the tj-pe and cotypes are the only speci- 

 meas now at hand, I feel little hesitation in referring to the present 

 species a juvenile Polypus in the University of California Collection 

 described by me in a previous paper (Berry, 1911, p. 303), thus 

 extending its known range as far to the southward as Santa Catalina 

 Island. 



Remarks. — P. pricei is most conspicuously characterized by the 

 delicate consistency of its tissues, large eyes, constricted neck, 

 very short subequal arms, short hj-aline umbrella, elevated suckers, 

 pale coloration, and elongate pointed body, in outline .somewhat 

 recalling that of an Argonauta. Owing to the inadequacy of the 

 material, I am unable to give a proper estimation of its relation- 

 ships with sjK'cies from other geographic regions, but as comjiared 

 with all other West American and North Pacific forms, it seems clearly 

 di.stinct. In the key (Berry, 1912a, p. 271) the present species 

 would fall nearest to P. apollyon (hongkongen.ns), but is certainly 




1913.] XATUEAL SCIENCES OF PHIL-ADELPHIA. 75 



not the young either of that species or of P. californicus. Despite 



their smallness, the four specimens are verj' nearly of a size, and 



it maj- be that they are approximately mature. 



The species is named for Dr. George Clinton Price, of Stanford 



University. 



Calliteuthis (Meleagrotentliis) heteropsis new species. 



McleagroleulhU hoylei Berry 1912a, p. 305, text figs. 13-16, pi. 50, figs. 1-3; 

 pi. 51; pi. .52. figs. 5-7 (not of Pfeffer 1900, p. 170; 1912, p. 291, pi. 22, 

 figs. 1-8). 



Having recently been able to con.sult a copy of Pfeffer's great mono- 

 graph of the (Egopsida containing a much more detailed description 

 of his Meleagroteuthis hoylei than had previously been given, together 

 with an excellent series of figures of the same, I am forced to the 

 opinion that my reference of the Albatross Calif ornian specimens 

 to this species was an error and that they represent a nearl.y allied 

 but unnamed form. As I have already given a careful and full 

 description of these specimens, its repetition is unnecessary here, 

 but it should be added that, as compared with M. hoylei, C. heteropsis 

 differs especially in the following characteristics: 



(1) There is a somewhat greater number of suckers and pads 

 in the fixing apparatus of the tentacles, and these exhibit the fol- 

 lowing differences in arrangement : in hoylei the dorsal series comprises 

 five pads and the same number of suckers in regular alternation, 

 while the ventral and more proximal row beginning at the carpus 

 comprises (according to Pfeffer's figure) 1 sucker, 2 pads, 2 suckers, 

 1 pad, 2 suckers, 1 pad — a very peculiar order indeed; in heteropsis 

 the dorsal series contains 7 pads alternating with an equal number 

 of suckers, while the ventral row commencing at its distal end con- 

 tains a .small sucker, then a larger one, then two smaller pads, then 

 two larger suckers, two pads, two suckers, two pads, and two suckers 

 — all nearly in the same Hne, but occurring in pairs in regular alter- 

 nation. 



(2) There is no evidence whatever of the presence of cartilaginous 

 tubercles, either along the mcdio-dorsal line, along the arms, or any- 

 where else. 



(3) The arms are relatively stouter. 



(4) The number of teeth on the horny rings of the sessile arm 

 suckers is much smaller (7-8 instead of 20), and these are apparent 

 onlyupon the upper half of the ring. 



In .some respects the present species approaches the recently 

 described C. asteroessa Chun, but is probably sufficiently distinct. 




76 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Chun (1910, p. 170) has united Meleagroteuthh to CalUteuthis 

 \'errill 1880, as a subgenus, a proceeding M'ith which the writer is 

 in accord. 



Gonatus magister new species. 



Goiialus fabricii (?) Berry 1912n, p. 310, pi. 52, figs. 1-2; pi. 53; pi. .54, 

 figs. 1—4; pi. 55, figs, 1, 3-7 (not of Steenstrup (7 al.). 



In the work cited I referreti a number of small decapods from the 

 California coast to the widespread Gonatus fabricii, and somewhat 

 doubtfully included with them two large squids from the Puget 

 Sound Region. Since that time, through the kindness of ]Miss A. L. 

 Ma.ssy, I have received a specimen of the true G. fabricii from the 

 Irish coast, and a comparison with this now leads me to consider 

 the Puget Sound specimens, at least, to represent a new species. 



Owng to the detailed description of these specimens I have already 

 given, it is necessary here merely to give a brief resume of the feat- 

 ures which appear peculiar to them. As compared with the Irish 

 specimen, they are much larger, heavier, and more massive in every 

 way. The fins are over one-half the length of the body, are more 

 obtusely angled, and are scarcely at all produced at the extremity, 

 while at the same time they appear to be thicker, more firmly at- 

 tached to the body, more widely separated, and with less developed 

 anterior lobes. 



The most conspicuous and important difference, however, is to 

 lie found in the structure of the tentacular arms, for the clubs are 

 not only differently shaped, but their inner faces are completely 

 clothed by a multitude of fine suckers quite unaccompanied by hooks 

 or even any traces of the same. I have carefully re-examined the 

 specimens on several different occasions and nowhere can find the 

 slightest scars to indicate that such .structures might once have 

 been present. In the region corresponding to their position in G. 

 fabricii, there is not even a bare space ("einer glatten langlichen 

 Central-Flache" of Middentlorff) nor do the suckers extend .so far 

 down the stalk as in that species. The fixing apparatus is very 

 simple and inconspicuous, comprising some 23-2.5 small marginal 

 pads alternating with a similar number of suckers on the club proper, 

 besides a number more extending down the .stalk. These suckers 

 are all minute, none of them conspicuously larger or otherwise 

 differentiated from the others, and there are no accessory ridges 

 conn('ct<'(i with them as in (I. fabricii. The contrast with either the 

 excellent figures of Steenstrup (1881, j)l. 1), or the brief though clear 

 description given by MiddcndortT (1819, p. .'il.")) for lii-i Oin/chotcHthia

kamtschatica , or the specimen sent me by Miss Massy, is throughout 

 very marked. It should be noted that the gross dimensions of 

 Middendorff' s specimen correspond very fairly to those of the indi- 

 viduals before me, so that the differences do not seem explicable 

 on the ground of age. 



Type._ — Cat. 2,084 of the Invertebrate Series, Stanford University 

 Collections [S. S. B. 88]. 



Type Locality. — Puget Sound, Washington. 



Whether the young specimens taken by the Albatross are true 

 G. fahricii or a young stage of the present species is still a matter 

 of doubt. 



Onychoteuthis banksii (Leach, 1817) Ffirussac, 1826. 



This species has recently been obtained off New^jort, California 

 (Berry, 1912, p. 83, figs. 44-46). I had previously overlooked the 

 fact that Middendorff (1849, p. 516, pi. 12, fig. A) describes a much 

 smaller specimen from Bering Sea as 0. Bergii Lichtenstein. He also 

 mentions an Octopus {Polypus) from the same region — "vielleicht

OXYEHOPUS TRIGEMINUS Dumeril and Bibron THE TYPE OF 

 ERYTHROXYRHOPUS gen. nov. 



BY J. C. THOMPSON, SURGEON U. S. N. 



The classification contained in the Catalogue of the Snakes in the 

 British Museum will unquestionably remain our standard for years 

 to come. Nevertheless, when the suborder Serpentes has been 

 critically examined from the standpoint of comparative anatomj' 

 along the lines suggested by Cope, there must be changes. 



When dissecting serpents, especiallj' those that are now placed 

 in the larger genera, one sees species grouped that really should be 

 separated. In recording unusual structural conditions, in suggesting 

 new generic names, or in the regrouping of species, the following 

 routine will be observed: The specimens examined will be recorded 

 under the exact specific name employed in the Catalogue of the Snakes 

 in the British Museum, and where a new generic name is established, 

 it will be proposed provisionally, not for immediate use, but awaiting 

 a thorough examination of the subfamily to which it belongs. 



In studying Oxyrhopus trigeminus (Dumeril anil Bibron) it was 

 found to possess an hemipenis without calyces and with an apical 

 di.sk. This is a condition widely different from Oxyrhopus clcelia 

 (Daudin) and Oxyrhopus petolarius (Linnaeus), in which the organ 

 has calyces and is without a disk. Two opisthoglyph serpents were 

 previously known with a similar organ. These, Erythrolamprus 

 asailapii (Linnseus) and Philodryas elegans (Tschudi), have been 

 grouped by Cope in the subfamily of Erythrolamprince } Oxyrhopus 

 trigeminus (Dumeril and Bibron) is believed to be worthy of generic 

 recognition. On the other hand, to alter a name well-established in 

 literature from the time of Dum6ril and Bibron, should not be under- 

 taken without grave necessity. In this case the necessity will only 

 ari.se when the great majority of the Dipsadomorphinw- have been 

 examined anatomically, and one is in a ])osition to propose a re- 

 arrangement of the species l)a.sed u))(i!i a far wider kiidwlcdgc of their 

 organs than is at present possessed.

BESCEIPTIONS AND BECORDS OF SOUTH AMERICAN ORTHOPTERA, WITH 

 THE DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SUBSPECIES FROM CLARION ISLAND. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN. 



Ill the following pages are contained the descriptions of one new 

 genus, nine new species and one new subspecies, from localities 

 extending from Panama and Surinam south to southern Brazil and 

 from Clarion Island in the Pacific Ocean, off Lower California. 

 jNIuch information concerning the variation of certain species and 

 data on the range of others, accumulated from a number of sources, 

 is here presented for the first time. 



By far the greater part of the material here treated is contained 

 in the Hebard Collection, all of the new species being from that 

 series, while a number of interesting forms are from the collection 

 of the United States National Museum. My thanks are due to Mr. 

 Hebard and the authorities of the National Museum for the privilege 

 of studying the material.

This specimen differs frorii the type in a few details, as the exact 

 curve of the lateral pronotal carinse and the degree of constriction 

 of the frontal costa dorsad and ventrad of the ocellus, but the differ-

These specimens have the tegmina with the transverse fuscous 

 clouds very tUstinct proximad, becoming weak distad and extending 

 across the tegmina except for the anal area. The rosy suffusion 

 of the costal section of the wing is weaker than on the disk, being 

 only a coloration of the veins on a fuscous ground.

This species has a broad blackish margin to the wings, the proximal 

 portion of the margin being colored the same as the peripheral 

 section, while the caudal tibiae are chiefly glaucous-green. True 

 Tropidacn's dux (Drury)^ from the Bay of Honduras appears to be 

 the species which Pictet and Saussure have described as Trupi- 

 daais cardinalis, as shown by the general reddish color of the limits 

 and narrow black margin of the wings, both features distinctly 

 indicated in Drury's description and figure. 



It would seem from our present knowledge of the dux-la(rcillei 

 group that there is a regular increase southward in the width of the 

 blackish margin to the wings, the individuals from the northern 

 section of the range of the group have the marginal band very 

 narrow, those from the southern part of the range having it wide. 

 The future may show the necessity of considering the various species 

 allied to dux as mere geographic races.

As the female sex was hitherto unknown, a few notes are here 

 given from the specimen in hand. 



The eyes are less prominent in the female than in the male, while 

 the head is broader proportionately at the base of the mandibles. 

 The lateral facial carinas are much more divergent in the female, 

 while the .structure of the fastigium and frontal costa is about 

 the same in both se.xes. The interspace between the mesoster- 

 nal lobes is slightly longitudinal in the male, subquadrate in the 

 female, while the metasternal loljes are separated bj' a very narrow 

 space in the male and by a considerable transverse interspace in the 

 female. The face and mouth parts of the male are very pale 

 ochraceous, distinctly contrasted with the general coloration.

With onlj' Burmeister's very brief description to furnish one 

 the characters of the species, it is somewhat difficult to decide 

 whether the specimen in hand is his species or not. Burnieister de- 

 scribes the genicular regions, caudal tibiae and tarsi as sanguineous, 

 while in the ^Nlinas ( Jeraes individual only the tarsi and distal half of the 

 tibiae are of that color, but this may possibly be due to the fact that 

 the original specimen was a male. Until further evidence is at hand, 

 it seems preferable to use Burmeister's name for the specimen 

 before us.

 in which the specimen was immersed, but the pattern, as it remains, 

 is essentially the same as in the Culebra representative.

This is an extremely interesting short-winged form of the rather 

 widely spread S. vaga, immediately distinguishable by the short 

 tegniina and wings which very slightly surpass the tips of the caudal 

 femora. The typical series of five, one male and four females, has 

 ijeen immersed in a liquid preservative and in consequence the 

 coloration and to a certain extent minor structural characters 

 can hardly be cniisidored to furnish diagnostic characters. 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. HI 



On comparison \vith a series of vaga from a numlaer of localities, 

 the Clarion Island series is seen to be practically identical except 

 for the short tegmina and wings. In view of the uniformity of 

 this character in all of the five specimens, we deem it best to con- 

 sider the Clarion Island form at least a geographic subspecies, 

 limited as far as known to Clarion Island. It is quite curious 

 to note that typical vaga is found on Guadelupe Island off the west 

 coast of Lower California, in fact, that island was one of the 

 original localities, and from the measurements given by Scudder 

 it will be seen that the specimens were of the normal long-winged 

 type. The distance of Guadelupe Island from the nearest portion 

 of the mainland, i.e., Lower California, is about one hundred and 

 seventy miles, while Clarion Island is about four hundred and thirty- 

 five miles from Cape San Lucas, the nearest mainland point. The 

 difference in distance may possibly account for the difference in 

 wing leng-th by the hypothesis that vaga regularlj' flies to and fro 

 between Guadelupe Island and the mainland, and the resident 

 brood is recruited by new arrivals and produces, through the in- 

 fluence of new blood and the presence thereby of a comparatively 

 active migratory influence, generations in which the wings are very 

 powerful. On the other hand, Clarion Island was probably colon- 

 ized by stray migrants, and from these has evolved a short-winged 

 type through isolation and lack of use for the \\4ngs except in a 

 restricted area. While we are unaware of the presence of S. vaga 

 on the Revillagegedo Islands, the species, and possibly subspecies, 

 may occur there, the nearest one of the group, Roca Partida, being 

 one hundred and fort.y miles distant from Clarion Island. 



The measurements of the tjijes of Schistocerca vaga brevis are as

This species is quite difficult to distinguish in the female sex 

 from the allied S. desiliens Scudder, but the color of the caudal tibia?, 

 i.e., varying shades of glaucous in cequalis and reddish in desiliens, 

 appears to be a convenient character by which to separate specimens.

In the male sex the form of the cerci, tapering antl very narrowly 

 rounded in desiliens and subequal and subtruncate in (vqualis, 

 is- a fairly satisfactory clue to the species. The cerci in the three 

 males available for study have the apical angular emargination 

 described by Scudder extrememly slight and hardly perceptible.

 effect that the species "invaded" the region "from September, 

 1882, to January, 1883," and he also states the "flight was to the

There is in this series a very considerable amount of variation

NORTH BORDER RELATIONS OF THE TRIASSIC IN PENNSYLVANIA. 

 BY EDGAR T. WHERRY, PH.D. 



The uniform gentle northwest dip of the Triassic Red-beds 

 throughout the greater part of the belt crossing southea.stern 

 Pennsylvania has been a subject of comment since the earliest days 

 of study of the region. Henry D. Rogers, in his final report,^ 

 cleverly suggested that it was due to inclined deposition, from 

 northward-flowing waters, such as can be observed in present-day 

 river deltas. The inadequacy of this explanation is made apparent, 

 however, by the evident level-surface origin of the fossil footprints 

 and rain-drop impressions which have since been found, as well 

 as by the fact that in certain places, especially toward the northwest 

 border of the belt, the dips show considerable variations, both in 

 amount and direction. 



No simple process of uplift and folding, however, can account 

 for the relations observed. The fact that thousands of feet of 

 strata exposed in the southern portion of this belt are totally lacking 

 along its northern edge implies that either profound faulting must 

 have occurred there or that progressive overlap on an extensive 

 scale must have- accompanied the deposition of tlu- l)C(ls. In 

 the course of the writer's studies of the Triassic. carried on at 

 intervals during the past six years, some evidence bearing on this 

 point has been accumulated. - 



As shown elsewhere,' the Triassic of Pennsylvania can be divided 

 into three formations, which from the base upwards are: the 

 Stockton (Norristown) arkosic sandstone and conglomerate, 5,500 

 feet in maximum thickness, which outcrops along the southern 

 edge of the belt ; the Lockatong (Gwynedd) dark shale, which ap- 

 pears as a lens between the other two, 3,500 feet thick at the Dela-

ware River, gradually thinning westward, and dying out in northern 

 Chester County, but reappearing north of Lancaster and repre- 

 sented by 1,000 feet of carbonaceous sandstones at the Susquehanna; 

 and the Brunswick red shale and conglomerate, up to 16,000 feet 

 thick, which lies against the older rocks along the northern bound- 

 ary. Although the evidence is not sufficient for definite correlation, 

 it seems probable that these are roughly equivalent to the Bunter, 

 Lower Keuper, and Upper Keuper of Europe, respectively. 



The following sections represent two alternative explanations 

 of the structure of the Triassic basin in this region.

It is liclicvcd tliat Section B most correctly deijiets the relation- 

 ships existing through the greater part of the Pennsylvania Triassic; 

 area, although in Connecticut and in northern New Jersey sections 

 of the type of A have been thought to accord best with the observed 

 facts. This conclusion is. based, first, on studies of the actual 

 contacts exposed along the northern boundary and, second, on 

 certain inferences drawn from features shown by tiic rocks in other 

 jiortions of the area. 



While, the northern Ijoundary of the Triassic against the older 

 rocks is usually marked by a slight depression and deeplj- coveretl 

 by soil, more or less definite contacts can be seen in at least .six 

 places, namel}', Monroe on the Delaware; Si)ringtown, Bucks 




116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AC.VDEMY OF [^Nlarch, 



County; Boyertowii, Berks County; south of Reading, on the 

 Schuylkill: Cornwall, Lebanon County, and on the west bank 

 of the Susquehanna below New Cumberland. The writer's studies 

 have not been extended southwest of the Susquehanna River, 

 but Mr. George W. Stose, of the U. S. Geological Survey, who has 

 traced the line through the Fairfield Quadrangle, states (private 

 communication) that overlap relations occur there also. 



The exposures at Monroe, a small village on the west bank of the 

 Delaware River along the Easton-Philadelphia trolley line, nine 

 miles south of the former place, have been studied and described 

 by Dr. H. B. Kiimmel.* The Brunswick conglomerate appears 

 to overlie a bluish-gray (probably Cambrian) limestone, although 

 the actual contact is covered by talus, and he regards it as probable 

 that overthrust faulting has occurred. There is admittedly no 

 direct evidence of this, but even if it does exist, it must be of very 

 limited extent, and can have no bearing on the relation of the 

 formations as a whole, because the fault-boundary shown in Section 

 A would l)e of normal type and man.y thousands of feet in throw. 

 About 500 feet south of the first exposure a ledge of white rock 

 appears at the base of the trolley cut, and is solidly overlain by the 

 Triassic conglomerate. This may represent only a local pha.se 

 of the Triassic itself, and, if so, has no significance, but it may also 

 possibly l)e pre-Triassic limestone, in which case the existence 

 of a fault is out of the question. 



Aliout a mile and a half southeast of Spring-town, Bucks County, 

 five miles southwest of the Delaware, what appears to be a contact 

 is exposed in the bed of a brook. A rounded ledge of a j'cllowish 

 quartzite similar in all respects to the Cambrian (Hardyston) of 

 the region, at least 12 feet long and 4 feet wide, shows fragments of 

 typical Triassic conglomerate solidly welded to it. It is true that 

 neither rock can be traced to solid connection with the main ex- 

 posures in the vicinity, and the quartzite may not be in place, but 

 it is too large a mass to have been carried far. 



For some twenty miles southwest of this point nothing that can 

 be regarded as a definite contact has been discovered, and there are 

 rea.sons for believing that locally slight faults occur, but at several 

 places in the vicinity of Boyertown, Berks County, overlap re- 

 lations are again shown. As noted l)y Dr. Spencer,^ along the road

in the valley of West Swamp Creek, southeast from Bechtelsville, 

 metamorphosed shales — "baked shales which may belong to the 

 IVIesozoic" — overlie blue Paleozoic limestones. The exposure is 

 not a good one, yet there can be no doubt that actual overlap 

 occurs. 



Additional evidence for this vicinity is furnished by a well record 

 described by D'lnvilliers^ as follows: "From the Montgomery 

 county line, at A. Schultz's house, [three miles northeast of Bech- 

 telsville] .... to the north l)order of the Mesozoic, is a distance 

 of 6,400 feet; the average dip, 30°; calculated thickness of Mesozoic 

 at Schultz's, 3,000 feet; nevertheless, Mr. Schultz's water well 

 struck the limestone floor beneath the Mesozoic at less than 200 

 feet." The supposed outlying patch of limestone, "left bare by the 

 denudation of the thin covering of red shale" (ibid., p. 20.5) appears,, 

 however, to be a calcareous conglomerate bed in the Triassic itself. 



In the extensive Boj'ertown iron mines the limestones bearing the 

 ore were everywhere found to underlie the Triassic beds.'' 



Continuing southwestward twelve miles, there is again evidence of 

 the existence of a local fault, as pointed out by the writer elsewhere,* 

 but in a trolley cut about a mile from the Schuylkill River an appar- 

 ent overlap is poorly exposed, and then at the Big Dam, northwest 

 of Neversink Station, is the erosion contact described by Rogers.'' 

 Here a fissure in the limestone into which pebbles of the conglomer- 

 ate had been washed was formerlj' exposed. At present the quarry 

 shows conglomerate composed of but slightly rounded limestone 

 pebbles cemented together by a minimum quantity of red mucl 

 resting on a somewhat brecciated limestone, into the cracks of which 

 more or less red mud has percolated, so that it requires very close 

 examination to make out the real contact. In the old iron mine 

 on Fritz's Island, around the bend in the river, and at the Wheat- 

 field mine, .seven miles to the west, ore-bearing limestone and sand- 

 stone were found beneath the Triassic beds as at Boyertown.'" 



At the great Cornwall iron mine, in Lebanon Countj', twenty 

 miles further west, Triassic conglomerate overlies, on the south

side, the Paleozoic strata bearing the ore," and, since diamond 

 drilling has showii that ore extends well under this cover, the Middle 

 Hill workings are now being extended in that direction. Spencer'- 

 discussed the probability of there having been progressive overlap 

 here, and published several cross-sections exhibiting this relation. 



The last exposure of this contact found bj- the writer is twenty 

 miles west of Cornwall, on the west bank of the Susquehanna River, 

 one and a half miles below the town of New Cumberland. Here, 

 in the Northern Central Railroad cut, the Triassic conglomerate 

 is in solid contact with the limestone, and specimens sho\ving a 

 "welding" of the two were secured. The plane of contact here 

 slopes more steeply than usual, perhaps 45° to the south, while 

 the conglomerate beds dip about 20° northward. 



It thus appears that all along the line through Pemisylvania 

 the highest beds of the Triassic, usually coarse-grained conglomer- 

 ates, overlap upon the older rocks — limestones, quartzites, and 

 gneisses. The few faults which can be recognized are too limited 

 in extent to have any bearing on the question as to the position 

 of the beds as a whole. 



That the several formations of the Triassic were not deposited 

 regularly and evenly on top of one another can also be inferred from 

 the observed lack of anj-thing like metamorphism — cementation, 

 induration, crystallization — of the lowermost (Stockton) beds. 

 Had these ever been buried beneath the whole 20,000 feet of the 

 two overlying formations, the temperature would necessarily have 

 been raised so high and opportunities for chi'niical action have 

 become so great, that some changes would surely have been pro- 

 duced. Again, the Stockton is known to thin rapidly northward. 

 Its thickness along the southern edge of the belt, toward the eastern 

 end, is as great as 5,500 feet, but where brought to the surface by 

 the Buckingham Mountain fault (the Flemington fault of New 

 Jersey), ten miles further north, it is only about 2,000 feet. 



It is therefore believcil that in the portion of the Triassic basin 

 crossing eastern Pennsylvania the locus of deposition of the beds 

 was gradually shifted northward during the course of the period, 

 .so that the successive formations overlapi^ed niort; and more to the 

 north, the basin being deepened by down-warping rather than by 

 faulting, as brought out by Section B.

It has several times been mentioned above that the uppermost 

 beds of the Triassic are, in general, conglomerates. But as this term 

 may cover rocks of quite a variety of characters and origins, it seems 

 worth while to describe them more definitely. For this purpose 

 those developed along the northern boundary for twenty miles 

 westward from the Delaware River have been selected, since thej' 

 are believed to be tj-pical of the formation, and since, by reason 

 of their accessibility, it has been found possible to study them in the 

 greatest detail. 



The most striking feature of the Triassic area in northern Bucks 

 and southern Northampton and Lehigh Counties is the occurrence 

 of rather prominent hills, the highest attaining 980 feet above tide, 

 or 500 feet above the usual level of the red-shale region, and ex- 

 ceeding those formed l)y both the diabase and gneiss, usually 

 regarded as the most resistant of rocks, in the immediate vicinitj'. 

 On these hills, in spite of deep dissection and freciuent steep slopes, 

 very few exposures of rock in place are found, although the soil is 

 strewn with boulders and pebbles of pink-stained quartzite. This 

 material has been previously interpreted in three ways, as Cambrian 

 (Chickies or Hardyston), Ordovician (Shawangunk or Green Pond), 

 and metamorphosed Triassic. The present view of the matter is 

 that, while the quartzite of the pebbles is actually of the second of 

 these ages, the pebbles themselves are not of recent origin, but 

 have weathered out of a conglomerate belonging to the ordinary, 

 unmetamorphosed Triassic series. 



This conclusion has been reached as follows: At a few places 

 along the hill slopes and at two localities where prospecting for 

 copper has been carried on, the rock can be seen in place. It con-sists 

 of a soft red mud ground mass in which are imbedded pebbles of all 

 sizes up to two feet in diameter, but mostly around three inches, 

 rudely but evidently assorted and stratified. The largest and most 

 thoroughly rounded of these consist of a gray to pink quartzite, 

 often in itself conglomeratic — containing white quartz grains up to 

 half an inch across, and occasional flakes of gray slate. These 

 quartzite pebbles are usually stained deep red by a film of hematite, 

 which penetrates the cracks and spreads out around them in rounded, 

 imperfectly dendritic ])atches. At the copper prospects above 

 mentioned they also show abundant malachite stains, which in at 

 least one specimen seemed to lie derived by weathering of a copiier 

 sulfide originally imbedded in the quartzite itself, but now leached 

 out, leaving tiny holes. 




120 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



Litliologically, this quartzite is in every way identical with 

 the Shawangunk, which forms Blue [Mountain twenty miles away 

 to the north, and with the Green Pond conglomerate of the same age, 

 occiuring in the highlands of northern New Jersej*. Not only 

 does this similarity cover the general features of the rock, but it 

 extends do^\Ti to such small details as the extent of the siHcification 

 ■\"isible under the microscope, the inclusion of the gray slate flakes, 

 and the occasional presence of copper sulfides (chalcocite?) in 

 minute disseminated grains, just as occurs at the Pahaquarry copper 

 mine on Blue ^lountain, eight miles northeast of the Delaware 

 Water Gap. And since there is no other formation anywhere 

 in the region of at all similar lithologic character, there would seem 

 to be no reasonable doubt as to the correctness of this interpretation. 



In addition to these quartzite pebbles, limestone fragments 

 are often present in the conglomerates, locally forming almost the 

 only constituent of the rock. These are usually less well rounded 

 than the quartzite, and, in fact, are often so angular that the rock 

 should be termed a breccia. When exposed to atmospheric agencies 

 they have usually weathered out, leaving a peculiar-looking cellular 

 rock. Nothing has been observed to indicate that these limestone 

 pebbles are of different type from the Paleozoic (Cambrian and Lower 

 Ordovician) strata exposed in the valleys to the north; in fact, 

 streaks of the black chert so frequently present in these beds have 

 been noted in some of the pebbles. Along with the limestone peb- 

 bles are also abundant flakes of a greenish schistose material, which 

 resembles the sericite partings developed in the limestones in many 

 places, occasional beds of the conglomerate being made up of nothing 

 but overlapping chips of this schist. 



Again in some places, gneiss pebbles are present in consiilerable 

 numbers, several of the types now exposed in the hills to the north 

 being represented. These, like the limestone fragments, are only 

 imperfectly rounded, and they have also weathered on the surface to 

 some extent, although perfectly fresh when seen in recent artificial 

 exposures, a.s along the trolley line south of Monroe, on the Dela- 

 ware River. 



On descending the hill slopes it is found that the p('l)l>lc> in the 

 soil become grailually fewer in number, and finally give way to 

 frost-shattered shale fragments, as roughly indicated on the 

 map by the small circles. There is practically no decrease in 

 the sizes of the pebbles going outward from the centers of the hills, 

 an<l absolutely nothing like a gradation from the congloineratos

through finer and finer sandstones to the ordinary Brunswick shales. 

 The same red sandy mud makes up the bulk of both rocks, the pebbles 

 having simply been dropped into it while still soft. Similar rela- 

 tions appear in four distinct areas, all of the same general type, 

 although the shape of outcrop is modified by diabase intrusions 

 and local variations in the dip of the usually practically horizontal 

 beds. 



That these conglomerates have been deposited chiefly under water 

 is shown by the stratification and assorting of the pebbles, rough 

 though it may be, and by the occurrence of interbedded thin lami- 

 nated shales, which show such features as ripple marks and rill marks. 

 That the water was fresh is indicated by the absence of marine 

 fossils, and perhaps by the red color of the mud. The source, mode 

 of transportation, and of deposition of the pebbles remain to be 

 considered. 



Three possibilities at once suggest themselves: we may be dealing 

 with either talus broken from cliffs by wave or frost action, alluvial 

 fans, or glacial moraines. 



The first view, that the pebbles are talus blocks, was accejitcd 

 by Dr. Ktimmel" in the New Jersey area. 



This conclusion is, however, quite inapplicable in the present 

 localities, for it is very evident that the nature of the pebbles bears 

 in general no relation to the character of the rock against which 

 the conglomerate lies. Dr. Kiimmel had observed the same thing, 

 and explained it a.s due to faulting, but, as sho^vn above, this does 

 not occur in the present region. Gneiss pebbles are found most 

 abundantly at Monroe, where the floor is limestone, and limestone 

 pebbles west of Coopersburg, where the underlying rock Ls gneiss. 

 Indeed, there is now no outcrop of Shawangunk quartzite, such as 

 forms the majority of the pebbles, \vithin twenty miles (although, 

 of course, it may have extended somewhat farther south in Triassic 

 times). Further, the fact that the limestone is less rounded than 

 the much harder (juartzite is just the opposite of what would be ob- 

 served in talus heaps rounded by wave action, but can be explained 

 according to the principle that the degree of rounding increases 

 with the distance of transportation, for the limestone rocks from 

 which the pebbles may have; been derived outcroj) nearly everywhere! 

 within a mile or two of the edge of the basin. 



The application of the criteria for the recognition of alluvial-

122 PROCEEOrNGS OF THE ACADEMY OF []\Iarch, 



fan deposits, as recently summed up bj- Trowbridge,'^ to the present 

 occurrences shows the imiiroliabiiity of their having had such an 

 origin; the majority of the pelibles are too well rounded and as- 

 sorted. In fact, the stratification is quite definite, and the pebbles 

 have apparently been transported and deposited by some agent 

 which did not disturb the soft red mud now forming the cement 

 of the conglomerate. 



The possible glacial-moraine origin of similar Triassic conglomer- 

 ate deposits in other regions has lieen advanced, in some form or 

 other, by various writers. W. M. Fontaine'* discussed it elaborately 

 and found no difficulty in reconciling the (sui:)posed) deposition 

 of the bulk of the strata in a "mild, equable and moist climate" 

 in the lowlands, with the collection of "unUmited supplies of snow" 

 and "its discharge in the form of glaciers" on the "lofty mountain 

 belt of the Appalachians." And many others had come to agree 

 wath this view. I. C. Russell,'* after reviewing the evidence, stated 

 that " the absence of glacial records seems to warrant the conclusion 

 that glaciers did not enter the basins in which the Newark rocks 

 were deposited. It does not follow, however, that the Appalachians 

 were not occupied b.y local glaciers. The suggestion that those 

 mountains were higher in the Newark perioil than now and were 

 covered \\-ith perennial snow, while the adjacent lowlands enjoyed 

 a mild climate, seems an attractive and very possible hypothesis, 

 but definite evidence as to its verity has not been obtained. The 

 proof that the climate of the Atlantic slope during the Newark period 

 resembled that of Italy at the present day, with glaciers o". the 

 neighboring mountains, must be looked for in the drainage and 

 sculpturing of the mountains, and the character and distribution 

 of the debris washed from them. A period of long decay preceding 

 the birth of the Appalachian glaciers would have prepared land to 

 furnish abundant debris when the facilities f(ir transportation 

 were augmented." 



In late years the idea that the red color of sediments is connected 

 with their depo.sition in more or l(>ss arid climates, has gradually 

 been gaining ground, and as other evidence apix'ared to favor

such a view of the origin of the bulk of the Triassic," Russell's 

 "attractive and very possible hypothesis" of glaciation of the 

 Appalachian Mountains in that period has been practically forgotten. 

 It is the ^Titer's belief, however, that "the character and distribu- 

 tion of the debris" forming the conglomerate beds under discussion 

 constitutes a very good argument for its revival. 



That the pebbles and boulders were carried down into the Triassic 

 basin along certain definite channels is clearly indicated by the 

 shapes and positions of the conglomerate masses. Something, in 

 fact, can be made out as to the possible routes along which they 

 came. In this region at present the position of streams is controlled 

 to a certain extent by fault or joint systems. Since most of these 

 structural features are, however, evidently pre-Triassic, it is reason- 

 al)le to suppose that similar depressions existed there then and 

 became at times river channels. It can readily be seen on the map 

 that stream routes (marked bj^ heavj' dotted lines) do actually 

 strike the edge of the Triassic belt at or near the centers of the several 

 conglomerate mas.ses, although of course changes of geography 

 since that period have altered the actual direction of the drainage 

 and superficial features. But the boulders in the conglomerates 

 are too large to have been carried by any streams flowing in these 

 ohamiels at the present day and, indeed, as shown above, torrential 

 alluvial-fan origin is improbable. Russell's arguments against a direct 

 glacial origin being also valid, as far as all later observations go, 

 apparently only one possible mode of formation remains — trans- 

 portation bj' floating ice. 



Evidence favoring this view has been unexpectedly obtained in 

 the cour.se of field work to the southwest of Hellertown. The 

 Saucon Valley, a broad limestone plain which lies to the north of 

 the Triassic highland here, contains ex-tensive deposits of what is 

 regarded as extra-morainic drift. It is believed that in late Quater- 

 nary glacial times the Lehigh River was temporarily dammed back 

 and formed a lake — locally called Lake Packer — whose surface 

 reached a height of 450 feet above tide, and which therefore .spread 

 over much of Saucon Valley. Floating ice, breaking off from the 

 front of the great glacier, which extended on the Lehigh only to 

 White Haven, over fifty miles north of the present region, came down 

 .stream, and some of it was carried by currents around into the 

 Saucon \'alley Bay. As this ice gradually melted, numerous well-

124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



rounded pebbles and boulders of various Paleozoic rocks, chiefly 

 quartzites, derived from the mountains to the north, were deposited 

 in a rudely stratified sheet over the valley floor in sufficient quantity 

 to almost completely cover the underlying limestone rock.'* 



At the south side of the valley such drift extends just up to the 

 Triassic contact, and many of the drift boulders are essentially 

 similar in size, shape, and degree of rouncfing to those weathered 

 from the Triassic conglomerate, and in fact can only be distinguished 

 bj' the color, which is yellow or brown instead of red. 



If there were in Triassic times glaciers in the mountains, they 

 must have formed terminal moraines, and drift from these would 

 naturallj- be occasionally transported on cakes of ice downa the 

 streams issuing from the glaciers, and be dropped whenever this 

 ice melted. >Some could not fail to be carried out into the shallow 

 lakes or ponds in which the Triassic red muds were being deposited, 

 and would then be dropped into this mud without disturbing its 

 stratification, as we actually find to be the case. Again, as the 

 distance out from the margin of the basin to which the pebbles 

 would be carried have nothing to do with their size, but only with 

 the size of the ice blocks and the resulting rate of melting, they 

 should simply become fewer in numbers, rather than less in size, 

 toward the center of the basin. As noted above, this is exactly 

 what does occur. 



It is not intended to imply that all of the materials of these 

 conglomerates had this origin. The smaller, subangular limestone 

 and gneiss pebbles and the green shale-flakes were, no doubt, car- 

 ried largely by direct stream action. But the writer feels convinced 

 that the features shown by the great mass of quartzite boulders 

 constitute a good indication of the correctness of Fontaine's and 

 Russell's theory that glaciers existed in the Appalachian Moun- 

 tains during late Triassic times.

The shape of outcrop and structure of the three subdivisions of 

 the Pcnn.sylvania Tria.-<sic implies either a profound fault on the 

 north side of the ba.sin or progressive overlap in that direction on 

 an extensive scale. The latter view is shown to be the most satis- 

 factory one in tliis region. The conglomerates developed along

A STUDY OF METAZOAN PAEASITiS FOUND IN THE PHILADELPHIA 

 ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS. 



BY FRED. D. WEIDM.\2\, M.D. 



The first part of this communication deals with certain statistics 

 regarding all the parasitic worms found in the Gardens; the second, 

 ^vnth separate species which have been of economic, scientific, or 

 passing interest. 



Part I. 



The statistics which follow have been compiled from autopsj' 

 protocols at the Laboratory of Comparative Pathology of the Phila- 

 delphia Zoological Gardens.' The autopsies number 2,807, and ex- 

 tend from November 25, 1901, to January 1, 1913. They were 

 performed with care, especially those on the larger animals. All 

 mamma'lia and aves djdng were examined. Only a few of the 

 rcptilia received attention. The organs were not extensively 

 dissected or examined microscopically. They were closely scru- 

 tinized grossly, and if occasion warranted microscopical sections 

 were made. For these reasons many of the smallest parasites 

 have been missed, and this may explain the small number of flukes 

 appearing in our tables. 



The table opposite shows roughly an average of (excluding 1901- 

 1905, when the parasites were not especially searched for) 45 

 infestations per year. In 1910 there was a rise due to cestodcs in 

 birds, and again a rise in 1911 which we trace across to nematodes — 

 again in l)irds. Referring to the General Parasitological Table II, 

 nematode column, we find that of the aves it is the Psittaci and 

 Passeres which are responsible for the latter rise. Our detailed 

 Psittaci records now lead us to a certain worm, Spiroplera incerta. 

 This worm was apprehended, however, long before these tables 

 were compiled. This talile led us to inve.stigate the Passeres which 

 show 33 nematodes. A coiled Filaria in the serosa of the proven- 

 tricle was revealed. We projwse to inve.stigate it in the near future 

 It is probably Filaria pungens. 



Table I is more of local than general scientific value. It shows 

 the incidence of para.sites by years, and enables us to trace to its 

 source any special increase of infe.station that may occur in the 

 Gardens.

General Parasitological Table V. 

 Summary. 



The summary shows, as to the relative numbers of worms, that 

 nematode.s are far the commonest; then come the cestodes, flukes, 

 and Acanthocephali in order named. This i.s the usual order given 

 in te.vt-books. It seems, however, that our summary shows too 

 great a disproportion between the nematodes and cestodes, due 

 doubtless to the endemic of nematode Spiroptera in the parrots. 

 E.xcluding those, a ratio of two nematodes to one ce.stode is obtained. 

 This would appear to express about the proper relationship, which 

 now holds good in both birds and mammals. 



Tables have also been made showing the location of the parasites 

 in the different mammalian and avian orders, and in reptiles, as 

 follows:

Since the greatest number occurred in parrots, our attention has 

 been especially called to those birds. In fact, our work on this 

 para.site of parrots has constituted by far the greatest part of our 

 studies in metazoan parasitology at the Gardeas. 



The appended talile shows the exact findings since March 1, lOOG: 




132 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[March, 



Spiroptera Table XI. 

 Deaths from Spiroptera among Psittaci. 



As ■tt'ill be noted, an average of 30 per cent, of all parrots coming 

 to autopsj^ harbored these worms. Is it the parasite which has 

 caused death, or is this simply an example of commensalism which 

 is so common in the lower animals? 



We find (consulting our Table XI) that the percentage of birds 

 living with worms is fairly constant, except for the year ending 

 1909, and excluding 1906 when the ca.ses were beginning to be 

 recognized. This would indicate at first sight that the verminous 

 cases were only incidents, that 30 per cent, of our birds had liarmless 

 worms which appeared at autopsy wIkmi the l)ir<l (li(>(l from inter- 

 current disease. 



To throw further light on the subject a curve was jirepared 

 showing deaths of Psittaci by Inonths. Again there is a rough 

 paralleliism between the curves of verminous antl non-verminous 

 birtls. The charts then would exculpate the para-site. 



Now let us consider the opposed evidence. It will be brought out 

 later that we have examined every parrot in the parrot-house ami 

 found 14 per cent, of our living parrots verminous. What does 

 this mean? Correlating this finding with (lur statistics, we hav(^ 

 established two facts: 



(1) 14 per cent, of our living i)arr(its arc verminous. 



(2) 30 per cent, of all parrots dying in a year arc fduiid verminous. 

 See Spiroptera, Table XI. 



A greater percentage (in fact, iinijiDrtionally twice as many) 

 of our verminous birds die as do non-\( rininous. To consider a 

 specific instance, suppose our bird-hou.-c c nntain 1 1(1 li\-e parrot.—- 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



A. From (1) above, 14 per cent, of our living parrots would be 

 verminous, 20 birds. 



B. 86 per cent, of our living parrots would be non-verminous, 

 120 birds. 



Suppose at the end of the year there had been 50 deaths (average 

 for 7 years). 



C. From (2) above, 30 per cent, would be verminous, 15 birds. 



D. Then 70 per cent, would be non-verminous, 35 birds. 



From A and C — Out of 20 living verminous birds 15 deaths re- 

 sulted, 75 per cent. 



From B and D — Out of 120 living non-verminous birds 35 deaths 

 resulted, 30 per cent. 



The mortality is more than twice as great for living verminous 

 parrots than for non-verminous. 



This is one point against the innocence of Spiroptera incerta. 



Our second witness is the autopsy picture. 



The Parasite. — It has been described in detail by Dr. Allen J. 

 Smith as a new species in his Synopsis of Studies in Metazoan Para- 

 sitology. Briefly, the mature female averages 14 mm. in length 

 by 0.6 mm. in diameter. It is rigid, of a dead or yellow-white color. 

 The male is distinctly smaller. They vary in numbers from two 

 to a hundred or more. The usual number is twenty or thirty. 

 They may be found in a ball of mucus in the lumen of the pro- 

 ventricle or burrowing into the mucosa. The smallest (larval) 

 forms are often found under the thick chitinous lining of the gizzard. 



The Host. — In severe infestations the bird is emaciated. It 

 .sometimes emits a wheezing sound (not pneumonia) or passes mucus 

 from mouth or nostril. Often the drojipings have been abnormally 

 copious, and when mucus is admixed (as it often is) infestation 

 has been foretold. 



The Lesion. — Even where there arc but a few worms (4-6) in the 

 proventricle, the swelling is prominent. Diagnosis can be made as 

 soon as the body cavity is opened. On opening the organ the mucosa 

 is found necrotic and overlaid by mucus. The worms, if pulled out 

 by forceps and relaid on the mucus promptly burrow into it and 

 disappear. Where the worms are numerous the viscus is enormously 

 distended, even exceeding the'gizzard in size. The heart is pushed 

 far to the right, the gizzard placed so low as to press on the cloaca. 

 In one ea.se a perforation had occurred, and seeds and worms were 

 found in the air sacs. On section the mucosa is necrotic, destroyed. 

 The wall of the viscus mav be so thin as to be translucent. The 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



lumen is occluded by the necrotic and mucoid debris. Microscopic- 

 ally the mucosa is in part or wholly necrotic and the parasite may 

 be found burrowing even close to the muscularis. The only reactive 

 inflammation seen is around the nerves, where a round-cell infil- 

 tration sometimes occurs. 



Necrogenesis. — From the clinical and postmortem findings it woukl 

 seem that a variety of agencies are operative in causing death. Where 

 the parasites are in small numbers in a large bird they are probably 

 not the cause of death. Occlusion of the pro ventricular lumen 

 probably plays a minor part by retarding food ingestion. Much 

 more important is the destruction of the mucosa of this (for birds) 

 important digestive organ. In fact, it has been called the glandular 

 sitomach in contradistinction to the muscular stomach or gizzard. 



This probabl}' accounts for the emaciation seen clinically. Theo- 

 rcticall}', this worm might elaborate a toxic material, as does the 

 fish tapeworm of man, which may act as an irritant on im- 

 portant vital organs. Such irritation was seen in a chronic 

 form around nerves in one of our microscopic sections. Dis- 

 placements of organs noted above (heart by pressure, gizzard 

 by weight of superjacent proventricle) could easilj' contribute to 

 the end. It is our belief at present that only a part of the cases 

 listed as verminous died as a result of spiropteriasis: that the cases 

 showing a few worms and not much tissue destruction died from inter- 

 current diseases, but that others, those so greatly emaciated, with 

 occluded lumina, pressure upon the heart and destruction of mucosa, 

 undoul)tedly died as a result of the presence of these worms. 



Our autopsy shows alterations of important structures, extensive 

 enough and serious enough to incriminate the parasites in s]iite of 

 the evidence of our tal)les and charts. This fact, considered with 

 Spiroptera Table XI, shows the worm to be of economic importance. 



In studying this endemic we have worked along thre{> line<: 



I. To devise a practical method whereby infested birds might be 

 discovered and isolated. 



II. To determine the life history of the worm. This is most 

 imjiortant from a hygienic and jirophylactic standpoint. 



III. Tn discover a t liera])eutic agent. 



Diagnosis. 

 \\'c' feel that we lia\e been successful in our iirst task. 

 The external appearances were never sufficiently characteristic 

 to lead to exact diagnosis. Some birds, even though i)a.ssing encjrmous 




1913.] NATTRAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHLi. 135 



numbers of ova, were in good feather. Others showed sjTuptoms like 

 any sick bird — feathers rufHed, head hung down, eyes ' closed. 

 Several cases, however, showed suggestive sj-mptoms. They e.xtended 

 the neck as though attempting to vomit. A macaw passed a frothy 

 material from the mouth. Another bird which did not have pneu- 

 monia emitted a wheezing soimd. Some of the birds produced 

 droppings in larger quantitj- than their mates, and where these 

 contained mucus, as they often do, we have foretold infestation. 

 But these signs were so inconstant that laboratory diagnosis became 

 necessary. 



The only avenues to diagnosis would seem to be the blood, urine, 

 droppings, stomach contents, and temperature. Some time has been 

 spent investigating the blood, but so many technical difficulties 

 arose and so much time was required that this means was abandoned. 



Experiments were also performed toward the production of emesis 

 and the recovery of the worms in the vomitus. Preliminary experi- 

 ments on pigeons were successful. One-tenth of a grain of apomor- 

 phine hypodermically caused regiu-gitation of food. This was 

 probably only from the crop, a.s no .stones accompanied the grain. 

 An amazon received one-fifth of a grain of apomorphine hypo- 

 dermically. Excited talking, laughter, and some dizziness resulted, 

 but no emesis. 



An attempt was then made to draw out the proventricular con- 

 tents mechanically. This failed, as a small catheter used as a stom- 

 ach-tube could be introduced only as far as the crop, as demonstrated 

 upon a dead parrot. 



The urine is e\'idently useless for diagnosis when we consider 

 the anatomy of the SLvian excretory apparatus. Temperature 

 determinations would require manipulations which the smaller birds 

 could not stand. 



The droppings remain as our sole means of diagnosis. The parasitic 

 ova are not easily found. The excreta of birds contain more waste than 

 human dejecta, where ever>-thing is generally in a finely granular 

 condition. The droppings are laden with such quantities of vegetable 

 cells, colored by chlorophyl. that they quite hide the ova unless the 

 latter arc in such great numbers as not to be lost by high dilutions. 

 Efforts to dissolve this foreign mfitter have been ineffectual. It 

 was not digested by pancreatin overnight in an incubator. Boil- 

 ing with antiformin. while ineffective, broke up the cloddy particles 

 of the droppings, clarified the vegetable cells, and dissolved the 

 mucus and urates. Much of the chlorophyl was extracted. Our 




136 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



routine practice is now to boil droppings for five minutes in 10 per cent, 

 potassium hydroxide, shake one minute, boil three minutes, centrifuge 

 for one minute. Two portions of the sediment arc examined for ova 

 under the § lens, one from the surface and one from the bottom. The 

 preparation of each specimen examined in lots of ten requires five 

 minutes. The examination mider the lens requires ten minutes 

 where no ova are present. When present they are detected usually 

 in less than one minute, although one case was diagnosed only after 

 eight minutes. The total time for examining one bird is thus fifteen 

 minutes. A mechanical stage is used and the entire wet specimen 

 is gone over. 



With a view to decreasing the amount of debris, the birds have 

 been starved for twelve, in the case of smaller birds, or, in the 

 case of larger ones, twentj'-four hours. The droppings are collected 

 during the subsequent twelve hours. That this is a necessary 

 procedure has been shown in subsequent examinations of these 

 same birds where they have not been starved. In every case the 

 eggs are more concentrated where the bird has been starved. This 

 was shown practically in the case of a green-cheeked amazon which 

 was passed as not verminous during our preliminary experiments 

 without starving, but detected after starving. 



Emploj-ing the method outlined above (for convenience called 

 "the improved method"), every bird in the parrot -house was exam- 

 ined. The birds were first moved to a separate building. The 

 parrot-house was then thoroughly fumigated with formaldehyde, 

 the cages galvanized and new stands erected. Birds whose drop- 

 pings showed ova were isolated in the infirmary. The others were 

 sent to the parrot-hou.<e. Those removed to the infirmary were 

 again examined by improved method without starving, to guard 

 against a jjcssible clerical error by which the specimens might 

 have been mixed. 



As a result of the examination of all of our parrots, twenty were 

 detected and isolated (14 per cent.). These twenty birds have been 

 used for subsequent experimentation. Some. too. have been kept 

 in an open cage expo.<ed to the weather. For these reasons it is 

 unfair to compare the mortality of these verminous birds with that 

 of the non-verminous at the parrot-house. If such a comparison 

 could be fairly made it would furnish valuable evidence regarding 

 the criminality of tiie worm, as discussed earlier in this pajjer. 



As these birds diet! they were posted, anil in all cases the worms 

 were found in tlu' provciitriclc. We lia\c fduiid that our tcchnieiue 




1913.] NATITRAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 137 



is very accurate. Mexican conure (P. Z. G. No. 2,599) showed at 

 autop.*y a solitary female and a solitary male worm, yet it was 

 <letected, January 31, 1912. Two ova in one slide. We have been 

 particularly gratified by the subsequent showing of the parrot- 

 house. Out of 23 birds dying during the last nine months, not one 

 has shown worms. 



Life History. — The determination of the life cycle of this worm 

 would be of .scientific and prophylactic value. In only one, Spirop- 

 iera sanguinolenta, has the life cycle been worked out. From a 

 hygienic standpoint, such a determination would be valuable liy 

 ascertaining: 



1. Mode of transmission from bird to bird. 



2. Time elapsing between ingestion of ovum and development 

 of sexually mature female. 



As long as we have to rely u])on finding ova in the droppings, 

 we will not be able to detect those birds with immature worms. 

 If we can determine the time elapsing between ingestion of egg and 

 maturity' of female we will have determined the period of time 

 during which to quarantine new arrivals, who, while not showing 

 ova in droppings, may nevertheless harbor immature worms. The 

 determination of this point would also give us the intervals at which 

 to reexamine the parrots which have been passed as healthy to 

 the parrot-house. In the absence of this knowledge we run a certain 

 risk. Future reexaminations will have to be made at quite ar- 

 bitrary intervals until this developmental period is determined. 

 Now that each inmate of the parrot-house has l)een examined and 

 pa.ssed, any cases developing or dying there \\ith worms will throw 

 new light on the subject. 



We have inquired into the life history of the worms by trying to 

 grow them in artificial media and in experimental birds. 



Ova from proventricular slime of a bird dead with Spiropleni 

 were placed in various nutrient me(Ua fbouillon, condensation water 

 of blood serum media), tap water, and weak alkaline and acid solu- 

 tions. These were kept at various temperatures. One series at 

 room temperature, another at 37.5°, and a third at the temperature 

 of a bird's body (41°). They were examined daily. On the sixth 

 day larval worms could be seen i.ssuing from the eggs in tap water 

 at room temjierature. They did not hatch in the acid solution, 

 but did apj)ear s])oradically in the other solutions at room tempera- 

 ture. The larvie may be extruded either through the side or the 

 end of the egg. One wonders how so large a worm coukl be coiled 




138 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JMarC'll, 



in such a small shell. The disappointing factor is the sluggish 

 action of the larva. It is encased in a well-marked sheath and while 

 hatching has a languid swaying motion. When hatched its motion 

 is scarcely more than a quiver. By the time it has been hatched 

 an hour all motion has ceased. Beyond this stage we have seen no 

 development. In 10 to 14 days the worm grows paler, faintly 

 granular and disintegrates. 



Supposing that some agent was necessary to dissolve the sheath 

 and liberate the larva, weak solutions of HCL and sodium bicar- 

 bonate were applied, but to no avail. At the suggestion of Dr. Fox, 

 an emulsion of parrots' proventricular mucosa was made and applied 

 to the embryos. There was no development at room or inculmtor 

 temperature. 



The ova in the preceding experiments came from proventricular 

 slime and had not received the action of the bird's intestinal canal. 

 As soon as a bird was found with great numbers of fecal ova, they were 

 washed out and the above experiments repeated in graded acids and 

 alkalis, diluted pigeon serum, and tap water at room temperature 

 and 41° C. The same results have been secured: they hatch best 

 in tap water and serum at room temperature. 



The mo.st rapid hatching occurred in a corked vial of tap water 

 at room temperature in which a female had been placed to deposit 

 her eggs for subsequent experiments. Four days later she was foimd 

 ruptured, her egg tubes protruding and also ruptured. In them were 

 worms ill all .stages of hatching. 



Animal Exikki.mf.ntation. 

 Three motles of tran.smission would seem to be possible: 



1. Pa.ssage of egg into drinking water, and direct entrance of 

 the egg to the ho.st, as in the case of the common pinwonn, Oxi/urin 

 vermicularis. This is the siini)lest possible cycle. 



2. Passage into drinking water, a hatching or jierhaps a moult or 

 two, anil then, i>y drinking or skin perforation, reinfestation, as 

 seen in the hook-worm, Xccatur ninericana. 



3. Pa.ssage of eggs into water or soil, ingestion by an intermediate 

 host with moultings, passage from secondary host to water, anil so 

 back to definitive host, as seen among tiie flukes, Fnsciola hcpalicum. 



A fourth mode, in which a i)iting insect might figure (a.s in filari- 

 asis) is surely ruled out, as no embryos ha\-e been found in either the 

 peripheral or deep bloods of our veniiiiioiis birds upon repeated 

 examinations. 




1913.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 139 



The first (direct) mode seems impossible for the following reasons: 



A. In several cases we fomid infested l)irds whose cagemates were 

 free. 



B. Several pigeons were fed on eggs or actually had them placed in 

 the crop by rubber tube and syringe. Killed at intervals of a month, 

 proventricle and gizzard showed neither micro- nor macroscopic 

 involvement. The last bird killed had been treated three months 

 prevnously. Pigeons ought to be susceptible to these' worms. Our 

 records show that a Barbary turtle dove and white-crowned pigeon 

 died with them in September, 1911, and three blue-crowned pigeons 

 were similarly infested in September, 1907. 



C. In order to get a perfect blood relationship, ova and eml^ryos 

 were placed in the crop of newly arrived parrots which had been 

 tested by the improved method and passed. Another parrot was 

 kept in a cage soiled by a verminous bird. One bird died in four 

 weeks with pneumonia. It showed no worms. The others were 

 examined regularly and so far have shown no ova in the stools. 



D. Ro.seate cockatoo (No. 166) was placed in a cage with infested 

 roseate cockatoo (No. 120) and drinking water allowed to become 

 soiled on August 28, 1912. The birds were .separated twelve weeks 

 later and the health}' cockatoo found still healthy, as shown by 

 e.xamination of droppings. 



In each of the four conditions cited aliove an opportunity was 

 afforded for the ova to develop by the first mode. They failed 

 to do so. 



In testing out the second mode, embryo worms were fed to pigeons 

 and parrots in the same way that eggs were administered in the 

 preceding experiments. The pigeons were killed at one month 

 intervals and the proventricle and gizzard examined by the micro- 

 scope. No infestation was found. A roseate cockatoo also received 

 the larva. In twelve months no ova have been found in the droppings 

 upon repeated examinations. The remaining possibility — entrance 

 by skin penetration — is now being tried. 



The third mode which would involve an intermechate non-biting 

 host, does not harmonize with our ideas of nematode transmission. 

 In only one case, that of Spiroptera sanguinolenta of the dog, could I 

 find such an example. The cockroach is the secondary host here, 

 and as our aviary harVjored many such' insects, attention was directed 

 to them. They were fed on cornstarch into which spiroptera ova 

 Avere mixed. The roaches were dissected at intervals of two daj's, 

 and tliough the eggs were found in the cioacal contents, no develop- 




140 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



ment was ever made out. The tissues of the body cavity were also 

 teased and examined with negative results. 



Our work on the life history of this worm, then, has Ijeen disap- 

 pointing. Aside from negative findings, we have only established 

 the fact that the eggs may hatch in four days in tap water at room 

 temperature. 



Therapeusis. 

 Theoretically, the prospect of a succe.ssful therapy is not bright. 

 The worms live in the soft, juicy wall of a canal between the crop and 

 gizzard. Sometimes they appear in the lumen of this canal, in which 

 case they are always surrounded by thick, tenacious mucus. If they 

 are pulled out of this with forceps and are laid on the mucus they at 

 once bore into it. It protects them from any passing medicament, 

 which is apt to have only a transient effect while on its way from the 

 crop to gizzard. Those worms, which may be partly protruded into 

 the lumen from the wall of the canal, can retract and retreat, even 

 as far as the serosa, as .^hown in one of our museum specimens. 

 The smallest worms are found under the thick, chitinous lining 

 of the gizzard. We have used, therefore, drugs which act on the 

 worms in the lumen (thymol by mouth) and by way of the blood 

 (arsenic hypodermically). The arsenic used has been in the form 

 of Fowler's solution and atoxyl. We determined the minimum lethal 

 dose for pigeons and administered a corresponding dose to the 

 verminous parrots.' No practical results have come from our efforts 

 at therapy. Two interesting points, however, were secured: The 

 parrots and pigeons withstood thymol and arsenic in enormous 

 doses, compared weight for weight with man. The droppings of a 

 parrot very heavily infested averaged for five days 182,000 eggs 

 per diem, .\fter a dose of thymol, on one occasion it jiassed 288,000 

 eggs in one single day. 



Filaria fasciata □. sp. 



In the last three years we have found si.\ examples of filariasis 

 in dead wild-cats. They may be founil in the intermuscular fa-scise of 

 any of the muscles of the body, l)ut especially in tho.se of the thigh 

 muscles. They number from two to forty. They are coiled in a 

 most intricate manner in the loo.se areolar tissue, but slip out rather 

 easily upon slight dissection and traction. The animal is emaciated. 

 Its blood .swarms with embrvos. 



' Fortieth Annual Report of the Board of Directors of the Zoological Sociely of 

 Philadelphia, 1912. 




1913.] NATUHAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



The female is 25-30 cm. long, filariform, 0..5 mm. in breadth. The 

 mouth is .simple, unarmed, circular. There are no papillae or other 

 special features at the cephalic e.xtremity. Head is continuous with 

 the bod.y. Caudal extremity straight, conical. Anus subterminal. 

 Vulvar orifice immediately anterior to same. 



The male measures 1 1 cm. in length. It closely resembles the female 

 except the tail. This is strongly curved- into three or four spiral 

 turns. There are two unequal sharp spicules, the longer IO.'j- in 

 length, the shorter 4.5,". There are five pairs of closely placed 

 preanal papillae and one pair of postanal. 



The still living embryos measure 280 to 330 microns in length 

 by 4 in breadth. They have a delicate sheath, lashing motion, 

 and no progression under cover slip. Not examined in hanging drop. 

 Stained specimens exhibit blue spots at irregular intervals, not 

 uniformly enough to be established as head or tail spots. They 

 have been injected hypodermically into kittens with the expected 

 result: no transmission after a lapse of five months. 



It was at first thought, with our imperfect specimens, that we were 

 dealing with Filaria striata (Molin). This worm is briefly described 

 in Latin: 



"Os inerme, mininuim; corpus filiforme, lougissimum, tenuissime 

 transversim striatum; extremitas anterior crassior; et posterior 

 obtusae; e.xtremitas caudalis maris laxe spiraliter torta, foveola 

 ante apicem limbo cincta, septem papillis permagnis.utrinque proedita 

 vagina breve tubulosa; penis brevissimus uncinatus; extremitas 

 caudalis femine inflexa. Longit. mar. 4. .5" crassit. \"' . Longit. fern. 

 1' 3"; crassit. \"'r • 



With the occurrence of another autopsy many specimens of both 

 sexes were obtained. It is now certain that wo have not here 

 Filaria striata (Molin), although the size and habitat of the two are the 

 same. The female might fall under the description given above for 

 striata, but the following differences are seen in the mule. 



1. The tail is strongUj coiled. 



2. There are six pairs of papillae. 



3. There are two spicules. 



The last difference especially would appear to warrant thr naming 

 of a new species. 



Tropidoocrca contorta " sp- 



Numerous worms were found in the proventride of a concave- 

 casqued hornbill, Dichocerus bicornis (P. Z. Ci. 2,640). The nmcosa 




142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



was (lotted closely by blood-red or blackish points, which were 

 usually best seen on the serosa, but sometimes best through the 

 mucosa. The latter was covered with a thick layer of viscid mucus. 

 The red points numbered perhaps sixty or eighty. A slight degree 

 of teasing with subsequent pressure over such a point expressed a 

 blood-red translucent body which proved upon microscopical exam- 

 ination to be a worm. From its subglobular shajie it was at first 

 supposed to be a fluke, but under the microscope it .soon revealed 

 characteristics which placed it among the nematodes. Thirty 

 or forty of these blood-red worms were expressed and examined 

 before any fixative was apjjlied, the material coming to hand very 

 shortly after death. 



All of these blood-red worms were found to be females. The camera 

 lucida drawings, Plate YV, and measurements are from fresh unfixed 

 specimens, which have been slightly flattened out by the weight 

 of the cover slip. They were examined in normal saline solution. 

 Thej' showed no motion even upon gentle warming. The host 

 had been kept at 10° C. for six to eight hours before autopsy and 

 the parasites in situ at the same temperature overnight. This low 

 temperature acting for twenty-four hours probably explains their 

 quiescence. 



No males could be found in the slime which so thickly covered 

 the mucosa. After the females had been expressed the mucosa 

 was teased into fine shreds and emulsified in normal saline solu- 

 tion. The sediment was wa.shcd in the centrifuge several times 

 and from it eight males were recovered with the aid of the micro- 

 scope. It wottld appear from this that the males occupy the same 

 positions that the females do, i.e., the proventricular crypts. 



The largest specimen of the mature female measures 2.1 mm. long 

 and 1.9 mm. broad. On account of the complexity of its coils it is 

 impossible to measure the length of the body axis. They are of a 

 blood-red color, i)oth grossly and microscopically, except the gut 

 tract, which contains molecular black material. This centra! 

 blackened tract may be seen even grossly upon careful scrutiny. 

 They are moderately resistant to pressure, the trauma of extraction 

 never rujituring the organism. Ordinary cover-gla.ss pressure will 

 rupture them only wiien the mounting medium (normal saline) 

 evaporates excessively. 



The form of the mature fenuiic is extraordinary and occasioned 

 the construction of the genus Tropi-furis (Diesing), later changed to 

 Tropidocerca. Before flattening the specimens appear (as shown 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 143 



bj- Lieberkiihn) in the form of a pumpkin. At one pole the head 

 projects, at the other the tail. The cuticle is very thick, transparent, 

 finelj- transversely striated and of a blood-red color. It is often pro- 

 jected in e.xpansions as the coils of the worm tighten. As the head 

 becomes retracted the cuticle forms a collar-like fold. In some 

 specimens the head and tail have been retracted into the centre 

 of the coil so as to become invisible. In others they project in a 

 varying degree, but never to a greater distance thai; half the diam- 

 eter of the worm. In such cases the projected part of the body 

 measures 100 to 150 mc. in diameter, tapers slightly anteriorly, to 

 end suddenly at the oral opening. (Plate IV, figs. 4, 5 and 8.) 



The Gut. — The mouth is unarmed and round. It is succeeded by 

 a dome-shaped buccal space which passes into a long oesophagus. 

 The oesophagus is marked off from the buccal space by a well-defined 

 ring. The walls of the oesophagus are very thick and composed of 

 circular and radial muscle fibres. The oesophagus can be traced 

 deeply into the coils of the worm, where it ends by a rounded extrem- 

 ity in the intestine. The intestine is visible only as a black, irregular 

 tract which t\\ists apparently with the coils. It commences as a 

 large cul-de-sac which receives the oesophagus. It soon narrows 

 and thereafter is irregular in .size. Anus subterminal. (Plate IV, fig. 8.) 



The posterior extremity of the worm narrows quickly to a sharp 

 point. Anal opening 450 mc. from tip. Vulvar orifice 900 mc. from 

 tip. Between the two openings the cuticle is thickened so as to 

 produce a rounded swelling. (Plate IV, fig. 6.) 



The general body cavity, including its expansions, is filled with 

 closely packed egg tubes, suggesting that such expansions are 

 especially designed to accommodate an extraordinarily developed 

 reproductive system. From the specimens examined in toto the 

 details of this system could not be made out. 



The ova are elliptical, measure 40 to 45 mc. in length and 20 to 

 25 mc. in width. Several specimens showed a peculiar unilateral 

 bib attached to the outside of the shell. (Plate IV, fig. 7.) 



Attempts were made to determine a regular arrangement of the 

 coils. This was very difficult in the case of the fully matured' fe- 

 males. It would seem from their shape that the body expansions 

 grew into the grooves between the coils so as to form a well-rounded 

 mass. This makes it difficult to dctprmine from which coil the head 

 ami tail protrude (if they ])rotrude at all) and which coils are 

 continuous with each other. The presence of the cuticular expan- 

 sions onlv serves to increase the difficult v. 




144 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March. 



Immature females were not nearly so puzzling. It was through 

 a consideration of the coils of different specimens at different stage? 

 of development, together with reconstructions in wax, that the ar- 

 rangement of the twists was finally made out. 



The sex of the youngest female could only be determined by 

 its greater proportionate breadth. It measured 2.5 mm. in length 

 and 0.2 mm. in width. It was found with the eight males men- 

 tioned above. It was cylindrical, colorless, and showed no internal 

 structure. It was not coiled, but even at this early stage of devel- 

 opment showed bv its angulations a disposition to coil. (Plate IV, 

 fig- 3.) 



The next female studied in point of age was coiled in one plane 

 only. It measured 1,000 mc. by 1,050 mc; i.e., only half the size 

 of the mature female. It was colorless, except for the gut. which 

 was black. In this case the body axis could be readily followed. 

 It was 3.5 mm. long. This specimen was fusiform, its greatest 

 diameter, 450 mc, was located at the posterior third of the body, 

 where the bulk of the gut and egg tubes were. The head and a 

 large part of the neck, 0.2 mm., are bent sharply dorsally. The 

 rest of the body then curls tightly ventrally to enclose the head and 

 ■sharply bent anterior portion. The tail ends sharplj' in a single 

 point. Its tip is recurved. Egg tubes may be seen in the l)ody 

 cavity, Init they contain no ova. (Plate IV, fig. 9.) 



The third female measured 9 mm. in length. This was 

 ascertained by flattening out a small female and forcibly with 

 needles straightening out the coils. Tiie body varies in width. 

 Its greatest diameter is 600 mc. It can now be seen that the iiody 

 cavity bulges out into expansions at several points. The a!)proxi- 

 mation of these expansions to each other, together with a coincident 

 coiling of the parasite, could easily result in the pumpkin-shaped 

 organism so commonly described. The distortion here jiroduced, 

 however, precludes a positive statement in reganl to an habitual 

 and orderly arrangement of these expansions along thi- body axis 

 in the living animal. 



The fourth female in order of maturity contained mature ova 

 (coiled embryo visible). It was ciiosen because it was not tightly 

 coiled. It was examined in glycerine with a stereoscopic micro- 

 scope. No cover-glas.s was used, thus eliminating pressure arte- 

 fact. A wax model was made by combining drawings ami direct 

 observation. 



The rigidity of the coils in the unlixcd female raised the ciueslion 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 145 



whether this was a permanent or a changeable arrangement. It 

 has been already remarked that even in a verj' young female, where 

 the anlage of the organs was not yet prominent, there was a dis- 

 position (as evidenced by angulations) to coil. This same early 

 disposition is also noted in the half-growix specimen which was 

 tightlj' coiled in one plane. These facts seemed to argue the coiling 

 as a peculiarity of the species. 



To shed further light on the subject, reconstructions were made 

 of two mature females after the wax-plate method of Bonn, and a 

 third (partial) reconstruction in pasteboard. In all three the coils 

 were very tight. In two specimens the head and tail project at 

 opposite sides of the coiled worm. In a third the head and tail are 

 close together. In the two complete reconstructions the tail re- 

 curves in a direction opposite to the general direction of the coils. 

 That is, tracing the coils in a spiral maimer down from the head — 

 either clockwise or contraclockwase, as the case may be — we sud- 

 denly come to an abrupt bend toward the tail, where it bends around 

 in the opposite direction. This peculiaritj^ is also seen in the half- 

 grown female mentioned before, and it is this reversal which led to 

 the uncertainty in determining the arrangement l)y direct examina- 

 tion. As stated above, the coils may (looking at the specimen head 

 on) run clockwise or contraclockwise. 



From a consideration of the camera lucida drawings of females at 

 different stages of development, along with the wax model and 

 reconstructions, the following deductions are made: 



There is a very early "embryonic" propensity for the worm to 

 coil tightly. The arrangement of such coils is not constant, the 

 coils turning either clockwise or contraclockwise. The head along 

 with a short anterior portion is always bent more or less sharplj- 

 dorsally. The caudal ex-tremity always twists suddenly in a direc- 

 tion reverse to that of the more anterior coils. As the female 

 becomes mature, the remarkable egg content causes a broadening 

 of the worm without a proportionate increase in length. This 

 causes the mass to appear globular. The pressure incident to 

 such enormous egg content obliterates any "dead spaces" between 

 the coils (internally or externally), and this tends all the more to 

 perfect the globular appearance. 



It is ])resumcd (in the absence of direct observation of living 



specimens) that the worm may alter its coils and protrutle head or 



tail into the lumen of the proventricle. It does not seem probable, 



from its bulkiness, that the mature female! migrates as does Spirop- 



10 




146 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [IMiircll, 



ieni inccrta. In support of this, the microscopit-al sections do not 

 show necrosis as in spiropteriasis, and we do not think that the 

 worms cause serious disease. The female certainly extracts herao- 

 gloliin from the host, hut does not seem to be wasteful as in 

 uncinariasis. The cagcmate of this liird, which is living and also 

 infested, appears perfectly healthy, and is standing such minor 

 l)lood loss very well. 



The Male. — From the fact that the specimens were found only 

 after teasing the mucosa (not at all in the luminal slime), it is pre- 

 sumed that they live in the same situations as the females — in 

 the crypts of the proventricular glands. This is, however, hard to 

 prove, on accoimt of the small size, translucencj', and relatively 

 small number of males. Serial sections might or might not, from 

 this last circumstance, include a male. 



The largest male measures 6 mm. in length. At its widest part 

 it measures 125 mc. The body is subcylindrical, filiform, tapering 

 anteriorly to end rather abruptly in a rounded extremity. The head 

 is not separable from the body. It tapers more gracefully posteri- 

 orly, ending in a tail which is curved strongly toward the cloaca. 

 Tip of tail is sharp, recurved from cloaca after the fashion of the 

 point of a fish-hook robbed of its barb. Cuticle finc'lj^ striated 

 transversely, thin, transparent. (Plate IV, figs. 1 and 2.) 



None of the male specimens display the blood-red color so con- 

 spicuous in the female. 



The oral opening is circular. It leads to a narrow buccal cavity, 

 which abruptly opens into an oesophagus with thick circularly dis- 

 posed musculature. This is succeeded by a straight, simple intes- 

 tine, which becomes coiled at its posterior third, to end 300 mc, 

 from the caudal tip. Cloaeal opening surrounded by a pouting, 

 prominent cuticular ring. 



Spicules uneriual. Th(> shorter measures L^O mc. The longer 

 measures .5,400 mc. in U'ngth, and when retracted extends to within 

 000 mc. of the anterior extremity. This spicule is, then, nine-tenths 

 as long as the individual. One .specimen was i)rojected to a distance 

 of 3.0 mm. This length does not reiiresent the full extent to which 

 it may project, as a part of the spicule had been broken off. There 

 an- two pairs of preanal and two jiairs of jiostanal ])a])ill;r. There is 

 no bursa. 

 Tropidooeroa contorta n. .sp. 



This worm falls ea.sily iiitn the genus Tropinuris (Diesing), later 

 changed to Tropidorerca. This gemis includes mnnerous worms which 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHIL.U)ELPH1A. 147 



lie in the proventricles of birds. They vary in size, in different 

 species, from 2 to 7 mm. in length. The striking peculiarity of 

 this nematode is the subglobular form and blood-red color of the 

 female. From the upper pole of the worm a short head projects 

 and from the lower a short tail.- 



I have found the following species described as infesting the 

 hooded crow, snipe, plover, woodcock, goose, black coot, widgeon, 

 grosbeak, seagull: Tropidocerca fisaisspina (Schlatthauber), T. 

 paradoxa (Diesing), T. gynarophila (Molin), T. bispinosa (Molin), 

 T. globosa (V. I.instow), T. mermis (V. Linstow), T. ieniiis (Lieber- 

 kiihn), T. certa (Leidy). 



Upon referring to these species I find that the structure of the 

 mouth and tail parts conforms closely to the worm I have been 

 studying. There are certain marked differences, however, which 

 seem sufficient to warrant the naming of a new species: 



1. Its tightly coiled form, which is not mentioned or figured 

 in any of the other species. 



2. Absence of the four equidistant longitudinal muscular bands 

 which by contracting give the subglobular shape of other Tropi- 

 docerca?. 



3. The remarkable lengih of the longer spicule of the male. 



4. Disposition of the male papillae. 



Believing the first-named difference to lie the most striking, I 

 have given the name contorta to the species. 

 Trichocephalus dispar (Rudolphi). 



From the large intestine of a Rhesus macaque (P. Z. G. No. 2,744) 

 three mature worms were obtained. They were very firmly attached 

 to the mucosa and more deeply imbedded than it is customary to 

 find them. The specimen showed tightly clinging detritus along the 

 anterior attenuated portion which could not be removed with a 

 brush. The case is of value because this helminthiasis was 

 associated with a purulent peritonitis. The text-book descriptions 

 do not assign any marked pathogenic properties to this worm. 

 It would seem hypercritical in this case to argue that such asso- 

 ciation is a mere coincidence. Tricocephalus dispar has also been 

 fount! in Pithecus sntyrus, C ercopithecus mona, C. poias, and C. sabceus, 

 Innuns erijthryacus, I. ecaudalus, ,Cyanocephalus sphinx, and C. 

 porcarius and in Mycetes senicnlus. It is mentioned as Tricocephalus 

 kniuris (Kud.) and T. palajormis by Raillet. Its occurrence in

these animals suggests hues of transmission from one host to 

 another. 



Microscopically, all three worms were found to be females. Two 

 were perfect. Head is missing from the third, suggesting that it was 

 firmly attached to the mucosa. The worms conform in every re- 

 spect to the accepted generic descriptions of Tricocephalus. The two 

 perfect specimens measure each 27 mm. in length. The posterior 

 portion is 8.5 mm. long, the narrow, more attenuated, anterior 

 portion, including the head, 18.5 mm. This gives a close proportion 

 of one to two. Measurements were made of ova which laj' in the 

 o\'iduct close to the vulvar opening. They are 23-25 mc. broad 

 and 52-55 mc. long, including the button. 



It is unfortunate that no males were included in the material, 

 since it is bj^ these alone that the species may be surely determined; 

 sexual apparatus (especially the sheath of the spicule) furnishing 

 the differentiating characteristics. 



As far as the material goes, this might easily be a specimen of 

 Trichocephalvs dispar. The ova are almost identical, measuring 

 for the largest specimens 25 by 55 mc. as against 23 by 53 for T. 

 dispar. It is true that the specimens are smaller, measuring 27 mm. 

 in length as against 35 mm. for T. dispar, but this is not an uncommon 

 \'ariation for identical species in different hosts. (Witness Ascaris 

 nnjslax in cats and lions.) Neither does the size of the eggs conform 

 to that given for other species of Trichocephalus: crenatus, 52 by 56, 

 from pig; affinis, ? by 65, from horse; felis, 36 by 72, from cat; 

 uiiguiculatits, 31 by 52, from rabbit; depressicoUi.s, 31 by 80, from 

 dog and fox; serratus, 39 by 56, from cat. 

 Paragonimus westermanii 'Ki^rb.). 



This jjarasitt has been fount! in two wikln'ats, Felis rufus. They 

 lie in cystic dilatations of the bronchi, generally in pairs. .Vn 

 infiammatorj' zone is present around each focus. There are not 

 more than half a dozen in each cat. The finding has been made the 

 subject of a paper'' presented Ix'fore the Philadelphia Pathological 

 Society by Fox, Smith, Kivas, and Weidman, in whicli it is pointed 

 out that this worm lias occurred in San Francisco, St. Louis, Cin- 

 cinnati, in the Appalachians, and in the C'arolinas, whence these cats 

 came. It is the belief of these writers that the parasite will be 

 found oftener in man if it is carefully looked for, and is likely to 

 l)ecome more frequent in the l^iited States with the development 

 of our East Indian possessions, where its effects are endemic.

The occurrence of this worm in wild-cat.s on our Atlantic .sealjoard 

 should he taken note of and remembered if this disease develop here. 

 Taenia echinococcus (v. SieboUl). 



This material came from a female Bactrian camel which died in 

 labor from a ruptured uterus. 



The cysts were most numerous in the liver, constituting fully 

 half the bulk of that organ. The spleen, was also extensively 

 involved, the lungs less so. The largest cysts in the liver were 

 sterile, showing no scolices. The specimens were observed alive, 

 and we were able to see the scolices retract the rostellum when they 

 were irritated. 



One of our microscopic specimens shows a scolex insinuating 

 itself between the lamellifi of the wall of the cyst, a circumstance 

 not commonly mentioned in text-books on helminthology. 



Taenia marginata (Batsch). 



The opportunity has presented of seeing this parasite in the most 

 important stages of its complicated life cycle. We have seen the 

 mature worm, ovum, and cysticercus. 



The strobile or mature worm is the common tapeworm of the dog 

 and wolf. Its head is provided with a circle of booklets. Our 

 specimen was obtained from a gray wolf after a vermifuge. The 

 terminal segments are the mature ones and furnish ova to the stools. 

 In these eggs six hooks can be seen, the precursors of the future 

 rostellum of the mature worm. These eggs, if ingested bj' herbiv- 

 orous animals, hatch in the intestine and burrow through the 

 liver to the serous cavities of the intermediate ho.st (a ruminant), 

 where they develop a caudal segment. This segment is cystic, 

 and into it on a long narrow neck the head is invaginated. This 

 stage is known as the cysticercus stage, and the parasite has been 

 named Cysticercus tenuicoUis. We have found these cysts in the 

 Angora goats, woolle.ss .sheep, ring-tailed lemurs, Mexican deer, 

 iMiropean roe deer, mule deer, red deer, and fallow deer. It has 

 been proven experimentally by several investigators that they are 

 pathog(!nic for young ruminants.' 



The occurrence of so many of the; cysts aroused the suspicion that 

 our ruminants might be contracting the disea.se from the canines, 

 opposite whose dens some of the deer are parked. Two ex- 

 aminations of the dejecta of our canines revealed but three in-

festations out of fifteen animals examined. One of these was an 

 American gray wolf, which was given a vermifuge. As a result 

 segments were obtained corresponciing to those of Tenia jnarginata. 

 The wolf has been isolated. He could easily have been the source 

 of some of the cases. In others, however, th(> animals had been 

 housed in a distant building or were ne\\l\' arri\iHl. They were 

 doubtless infested wIkhi they arrived. 



One of our cases has furnished a monster formation. The cysts 

 usually consist of a .single bladder, into which the head is invaginated. 

 By pressing upon such a cyst the head and long narrow neck may be 

 expressed. In the monster forms the cyst is invaginated by a 

 second cj^st, and into this second cyst the head is invaginated so that 

 when pressure is applied two elongated necks emerge, the innermost 

 bearing the head. The formation is discussed by Railliet, p. 238. 



If these cysts be ingested by a canine, the Viladder will be destroyed, 

 the head becomes fastened to the intestinal wall and gives rise 

 ultimately to the strobile, Tccnia marginaia. 



The material which forms the basis of this communication has been 

 obtained from the Garden of the Philadelphia Zoological Society, 

 from the Laboratory of Comparative Pathology of which it is reported. 

 During the work I have often had occasion to confer with Dr. Allen J. 

 Smith. The reconstructions of Tropidocerca contorta were only 

 made possible by his generous tender of apparatus and materials 

 from the Department of Comparative Pathology and Tropical 

 Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. I acknowledge with 

 sincere thanks his freely given advice and criticism.

AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES FROM ECUADOE, VENEZUELA, AND YUCATAN. 

 BY HENRY' W. FOWLER. 



Several collections of herpetological specimens have recently been 

 acquired by tiie Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 

 Important among them are those forming the basis of this paper. 

 Several species, apparently new, are described and figured. All the 

 figures are drawn to scale, the accompanying line signifying ten 

 millimeters. 



ECUADOR. 



The collection from this country was made on the western slope 

 of the Andes, from Guayaquil to Quito, during 1911, by Mr. Samuel 

 N. Rhoads. The fishes were reported by the writer during the same 

 year in these Proceedings. Since then all the collections Mr. 

 Rhoads made were purchased bj^ the Academy. In this connec- 

 tion I wish to e.xpress thanks to Mr. Rhoads for the appended notes 

 relating to the habits of the various species. 



AMPHIBIA. 



BUFONID^. 



Bufo marinus (I-innaeus). 



Two from Bucay. 



Bufo typhonius (LinniEus). 



Seven from Bucay. Found only under stones and logs, in woods 

 and banana plantations. 



This very variai)!e si)ecies ranges over the greater part of South 

 America, and in this connection I have examined many examples 

 from the following localities: Chapada, near Cujal)a in Matto 

 Grosso (H. H. Smith); Upper Punes River (Steere); Bahia (Cope) 

 in Brazil; Peru{Orton); Pebas (Orton), Ecuador; Surinam (Hering). 

 Some examples show the light vertebral line very conspicuously, 

 and in others it is wanting, ^'ariation in the color of the back is seen 

 from nearly uniform brownish speciriiens to those greatly blotched. 

 Some large examples have nearly all the lower regions blackish, and 

 they also show the postorbital flange greatly elevated. The Bucay 

 specimens do not show any parietal ridges extending from the post-

orbital. Females from Pebas, with eggs, have scattered white spots 

 on lower surface of body very pronounced, though the postorbital 

 flange is hardly developed. 



Bufo oasruleooellatus sp. nov. PI. V, upper figure. 



Body depressed, its width about equals that of head. No 

 bony ridges on head, which is broadlj' depressed, though not con- 

 stricted from rest of body. Snout a little depressed, contour as 

 viewed above little less than right angle. Ej-e large, though some- 

 what less than snout in length. Mouth large, rictus extending 

 slightly beyond eye. Lips thin, skin firm, and jaw edges trenchant. 

 No teeth. Tongue large, free for great portion posteriori}-, and hind 

 edge triangular. Internal nares moderate. External nares well 

 separated, so that each would fall in external fourth of antero- 

 interorbital width. Latter depressed, or very slightly convex. 

 Lores a little concave, smooth. Tj^mpanum small, verticallj' 

 ellipsoid, and vertical diameter about f horizontal length of eye. 

 Parotids large, well separated from eyes, though each equals about 

 If eye lengths. Along upper side of head from snout tip low fold 

 extends back, including upper eyelid externalh- and outer edge of 

 parotid. Fold on latter well marked, though not extending on costal 

 region. 



Skin largely smooth, though upper surfaces of limbs and hind pelvic 

 region above, with weak tubercles, a few of which are less developed 

 on lower surfaces of hind limbs and costal regions. Parotids and 

 eyebrows more or less granular. Lower surface of body otherwise 

 smooth. 



Limbs all rather slender. Fingers not webbed, second longest, 

 and first and third sul)cqually shortest. Finger tips all with rather 

 well-developed tubercles. Toes webbed rather narrowly at bases, 

 and each with somewhat well-developed distal tubercles. Two equal 

 well-developed metatarsal tul)ercles. Fold of skin along outer tarsal 

 edge. 



Color in alcohol dark slaty-gray above, ground-color nearly uni- 

 form, marked with a number of scattered more or less rounded dusky 

 to blackish blotches, each indistinctly edged with gray, or paler tint 

 than general body-color, to form obscure ocelli. Upper surfaces of 

 the.se limbs al.so marked with similar blotches, as three or four on 

 each joint. Lower surface of body pale gray, evidently translucent 

 in life. Breast and throat all more or less clouded with slaty specks, 

 or obscurely spotted with paler or more whitish tints.

 16 to 22 mm. All the si^ecimens were found under stones, bark and 

 leaves, in woods. 



This species is apparently related to Bufo ccErideosiicius Giinther,' 

 but differs in the color-markings. This is hardlj' due to age, as 

 Giinther gives the upper parts of the bod\- as uniform brownish- 

 black and the lower parts dirty gray-brown. Upper eyelids, sides 

 of trunk and extremities all show small smooth bluish tubercles. 

 His example was 3 inches 6 lines. Boulenger's figure- would show 

 that Giinther's toad cannot be identical. 



Bufo glaberrimus Giinther^ differs in the smooth skin and a rose- 

 colored spot in the groin, the general color being brownish-black. 



Bufo hmnatiticus Cope'' has a different coloration, especially a pale 

 spot anterior and beneath the eye. A poor specimen in the collection 

 from Coban (Cope) is not fit for comparison. Cope names var. 

 lachrymans," probably only a color form. Its length is 1 inch 6 lines. 



The present species shows some variation in its color markings, 

 and in some examples but few dark spots are present on the back. 

 The latter is also variable as to roughness on its fore jjart above.

CYSTIGNATHIDiE. 



Hylodes oonspiciUatus Gunther. 



Twenty examples from Bucay, t^ken in July, 1911. They were 

 found in a little spring-run which extended down into a grassy tract. 

 In habits they suggested Acris, as they would jump into the water, 

 swim across the brook, and come up again on the opposite side. The

largest is about 45 mm. ions- Youag examples show several whitish 

 spots in a streak, clue to the fold extending down from the lower 

 edge of tympanum towards shoulder. 



Three more examples with the same data differ from all the others 

 in the median narrow whitish line extending from the snout tip to 

 the vent. This line is clearly defined in all three. ^Nlany other of 

 the specimens show a trace of it on the upper lip at the snout tip, 

 but soon fading out in the darker color of the rest of the u])per surface 

 of the snout. These examples are thus strikingly like Boulenger's 

 figure of Hylodes unistrigatusJ 



Two other examples in the collection are likely identical. One 

 was secured at Hacienda Jalancay near Chinchi, in Chimbo, April, 

 1911. The other is young, and was taken at the camp near the 

 junction of the Chiguancay and Chanchan Rivers.

Hylodes achatinus Boulenger,'* based on a female 50 mm. long, is

ENQYSTOM ATI D^. 



Phrynisous laevis Gunther. 



Twenty from the mountains above Chimbo, at an elevation of 

 10,000 to 10,800 feet, in April, 1911. 



Nine from Hacienda Gorzon to foot of Blount Pichincha. on IMay

One from Quito, on June 4, 1911. This antl the above collected 

 by S. N. Rhoads. 



One obtainetl by Dr. "Si. Meitzner, from Huigra to Rio Chiguancay. 



Mr. Rhoads says these frogs were found in the open jiasturcs along 

 the mountain side. They appeared to crawl or walk, and when one 

 endeavored to grasp or try to catch them, they weakly tried to hop. 

 The sexes were noticeably different, and the males were alwaj-s much 

 smaller. As this was the spawning season, they were usually found 

 copulating. The males clasp the females very tightly, mount from 

 above, and their grasp is axillary. Sometimes another male would 

 grasp a male already in coitus. AH found were in wet or damp 

 places, extremely abundant, antl appeared usually oblivious to 

 danger. When handled they made a weak squeak. \'ariation in 

 color was very great, and on the lower surface of the body \"aried 

 from dark orange, brick-red to lighter or sometimes to a gamboge 

 tint. Upper surface of body usually not variable, mostly olive- 

 brown. None of the larger animals, as hawks, opossums, rats or 

 foxes seemed to prey on them. Their only enemy a})peared to be 

 an ant thrush {(irallaria monticola), and it did feed on them. 



DBNDROBATID^.

One example 19 mm. in length, from the camp near junction of

 February 18, 1911. 



Twelve examples from camp at junction of Chiguancay and 

 Chanchan Rivers in March, 1911. 



Some of the above differ from Boulenger's figure in showing the 

 white spots of the lower region much larger or with the intervening 

 dark color quite narrow, producing a reticulated appearance. Some 

 also have a more or less large dark blotch at each side of the sternum. 

 Upper surfaces of hind legs in most all examples usually distinctly 

 cross-banded with darker. Possibly a few slight tubercles or granules 

 on the back may be due to preservation, or only variation. Most 

 are perfectly smooth. 



Six others, young with same data as last lot, show the belly and 

 lower surfaces more or less whitish, though usually with two dark 

 blotches on chest, one each side of median line. 



Mr. Rhoads says the adults were found with the tadpoles hanging 

 on their backs. These were apparently attached to the rugosities 

 or slight tubercles on the back, the tadpole hanging by means of its 

 mouth, with the appearance of holding on as if by a teat. The 

 tadpoles were always found attached with their tails drooping back- 

 ward, and .six to ten were noticed on a single adult. In color the 

 tadpoles were leaden-black. The adults were quite noisy.

 have had Cope's type. 



According to Mr. Rhoads, it lives about sjirings, and recalls the 

 habits of our spring frog (Rann darnata). 



A tadpole, with the same data a^ the examples from Bucay, is 

 likely identical.

According to Mr. Rhoads, it is a most interesting .species. It was 

 found frequenting the banks of running .streams, where they would 

 sit on the rocks in the open sunshine. These rocks were always 

 near the edge of the water. When disturbed, the lizards would 

 suddenly dart across the intervening running water to the next rock 

 or boulder, and then turn their heads around and look at the intruder 

 in a most apish fashion. In crossing the surface of the water their 

 feet and tails would move so rapidly that no portion of the animal 

 appeared submerged. Often the fore part of the body was rai.sed 

 an inch or more above the surfacP. Frequently the lizards would 

 cross very turbulent water. When cha.sed from rock to rock, they 

 would finally attempt to cross even wide torrents, and are able by 

 the great speed of their movements to go as far as thirty or forty feet

Ijefore becoming exhausted. They would then sink below the 

 surface, and if watched carefully they may have been found to rise 

 again farther down stream to swim towards the bank, though Mr. 

 Rhoads had not seen them reach it under these difficulties. 



Another variety, green and blue in color, was found up to 3,500 

 feet elevation, at least to Chanchan. It lives about the streams on 

 the edges of forests. When the sun appears these lizards would keep 

 along the edges of the water. One was seen to cross a small stream 

 near Bucay. 

 Liocephalns iridescens Gunther. 



One from between Huigra to Rio Chiguancay, 1909-1911, secured 

 by Dr. Meitzner. 

 Liocephalus guntheri Boulcnger. 



Mr. Rhoads secured eight at Rio Bamba in April, 1911, and one 

 on a trip from Hacienda Gorzon to the foot of Mount Pichincha, 

 on May 11, 1911, at an elevation of 10,500 feet. Of the Bucay 

 examples, one was young and shows two lateral white lines, the 

 first from the hind eye-edge and second from below ear. 



TEIID.a3 

 Ameiva septemlineata A. Dum^ril. 



One from camp at junction of Rio Chiguancay and Rio Chanchan 

 in March, 1911, two from Huigra in April, and six from Bucay in 

 July. All obtained by Mr. Rhoads. Some examples vary in ha\ing 

 an outer or fourth row of ventral plates, sometimes rudimentary 

 or again better developed. Most larger examples show no median 

 streak down the back, and present in only one case. 

 Proctoporus unicolor (Gray). 



One from Hacienda Gorzon to the foot of Mount Pichiucha on 

 May 16, 1911. Taken by Mr. Rhoads. 



VENEZUELA. 



The .\mphil)ians and Reptiles from Venezuela form part of the 

 collections of natural history objects brought together by Mr. 

 Francis E. Bond. Like the fishes, which I have previously reported, 

 they were all secured in the Orinoco delta region during the late winter 

 and early spring of 1911. Mr. Bond has kindly given the collec-

NOTES ON THE TYPES OF SOME AMERICAN SPIDERS IN EUROPEAN 

 COLLECTIONS. 



BY NATHAN BANKS. 



During a recent trip in Europe, the author had the opportunity 

 to examine the types of a number of our spiders that are in European 

 collections. A considerable number of these, especially those de- 

 scribed by Count Keyserling, have been figured, and of these figures 

 are given of only a few, as in most cases we know his species, and the 

 types of most of his Theridiidae, described from the United States, 

 are in the Mar.x collection in the U. S. National Museum. Figures 

 are given of most of the other types that I was able to find, but in 

 some cases where the species is already well known to American 

 authors, I have not given figures. 



Few synonj-ms result from the examination, as in most cases the 

 unknown forms were from the western or southern part of the 

 <'ountry. 



The I\och material is dry and on pins; the colors of the Attidaj 

 are in most cases well preserved, but the structural characters of 

 palpi and vulva can rarely be seen, unless the specimen could be 

 relaxed. However, most of these are readily recognized, as they come 

 from Pennsylvania, the spiders of which are familiar to Eastern 

 collectors. I have given the notes as they were made, rather than 

 try to interpret, thus giving others the same chance in using them. 



Species of Keyserling. 

 Xystious discursans Keys. 



A small male; the sitles of the ceijlialothorax evenly dark, a large 

 .spot behintl (barely divided) a median mark, and in front brownish, 

 with a white band through the eye-region; femur, patella, and tibia 

 of legs I and II evenly dark brown, tibia III and I\' more maculate. 

 Abdomen very dark, the three bands going acro.ss, leaving only 

 narrow white marks. 

 Xysticus limbatus Keys. 



Two females from Texas labelled type; one (fig. a) has legs pale, 

 and a lyre-shaped pale mark on thecephalothorax; the other (fig. b), 

 with more shrunken abdomen, is much darker, and the legs more 

 mottled.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[April, 



Xysticus Hmhatus Keys 



Xysticns punctatns Keys. PI. XI, fig. 9. 



A male in Key.'^erling's collection labelled X. sin'alus type, is, I 

 suppose, this species, as it agrees with his description and is from 

 Georgia; the markings in the middle are hardly as hea^^,' as those on 

 the sides; it may be the male of A'. rariabiUs. 

 Xysticus 4-liiieatus Keys. 



This has been correctly identified. 



Xysticus gulosns Keys. 



American identifications are correct. 

 Xysticns emertoni Keys. Fig. 11. 



Female from Clcorgia; a large redilish species, the sides of cephalo- 

 thorax with sinuate pale lines. 

 Xysticns benefactor Keys. Fig. 18. 



Reseml)les A'', stonmchosus; the cephalothorax with four brown: 

 spots behind; dorsum of abdomen brown, with a broad pale mark, 

 indented three times on each .side. 



Xysticus hamatus Ke.ve. Fig. 7. 



.\ male from Kentucky, with very distinct aluloniinal jiattern. 

 Xysticus lenis Key.-. 



Immature female. A lichen-gra.\'-brown s])ccies, much mottled 

 especially on legs; ba.se of patella; above with two jiarallel i)lack 

 marks; five black spots on the cephalothorax. 

 Xysticus stomachosus Keys. 



Four females, as \vi' have identified it. 

 Xysticus locuples Keys. Fig. 10. 



\ large red-brown .species; sides rather evenly red-brown; legs- 

 pale; the male lia.s very long legs, very dark, the ci'iihaluthorax with 

 four dark sjwts and an elongate median s])ot, the legs lined above 

 with pale. 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 179 



Xysticus variabilis Keys. Fig. 6. 



Oiie female, a small species, which resembles a young stomachosus. 

 Synema uigromaoulata Keys. 



This is our S. parvida; the apical dark mark very plain, but not 

 -distinct on the venter nor around the spinnerets. 



S. parvula of Keyserling's collection has the white band on base of 

 .abdomen more distinct, and the dark band at apex goes down on 

 venter and forms a ring around the spinnerets. No difference in 

 .!?tructure as far as I can see. 

 Misumena spinosa Keys. Fig. 2. 



\'ery similar to .1/. asperata. 



Misumena georgiana Keys. Fig. 16. 



The cephalothorax shows a white X-mark very distinctly; the 

 femora are rather short. 

 Tmarus griseus Keys. 



Is a female lacking one moult of maturity, the femora somewhat 

 marmorate. 



Tmarus floridensis Keys. 



Ajipears to be T. griseus, a mature female, but legs all pale. 



Ebo Oblonga Simon. Fig. 4. 



Femur II not as long as the abdomen, tibia II as long as femur: 

 fephalothorax white, brown on the sides, but the margins pale. 

 Two females and a male, none quite mature, 

 fhilodromus praelustris Keys. Fig. l. 



The female is immature; the male is figured. 

 Philodromus marxi Keys. Fig. l". 



The ceplial(jthorax very broad; it is close to P. ornatus and jx-rhaps 

 the same; the Wisconsin specimen seems surely P. ornatus, but the 

 others are probably an allied .species. 



Philodromus satuUus Keys. Fig. 5. 



A small, even gray .species; legs III and IV with a dark line along 

 lower outer side on femur, tibia, and patella, most distinct on the 

 latter^ similar line, but fainter, on the lower po.sterior side of leg II. 



Philodromus expositus Key.s. Fig. 12. 



All femora dotted below as in figure; the cephalothorax a uniform 

 grayish-brown; and .so probably not P. signatus Blackwall. 



Linyphia galbea Keys. Plate XII, figs. I'S, 31. 



Louks like a large Bathyphantes, and the vulva is on the same plan.

One female. The raandihles show two large teeth on front of 

 groove and two smaller behind the groove, but it appears to be 

 P. brei'is Emer. {Xanthostoma Koch.) 



Species of Simon. 



Glenognatha emertoni Simon, Fig. 22. 



The figures will serve to identify this striking species. 

 Azilia vagepicta Simon. Fig. 14. 



The venter has a large yellow spot on the middle, and one near 

 the spinnerets; tibiie I and II with three broad dark bands. 



CicQTina robusta Simon. Plate XIII, fig. 32.

 Sosilaus spiniger Simon. Fig. 19. 



A very striking little species: the eyes on black spots. 



Sosippus californicus Simon. Fig. l.i. 



Cephalothorax entirely dark, no pale median stripe, but rather 

 paler toward margins: abdomen pale, with broatl ilark stripe above, 

 indented on the sides with faint pale marks, and in male with a 

 lateral dark stripe above, so the abdomen appears dark, with two 

 pale longitudinal stripes; venter pale; metatarsi and tarsi I and II 

 very long and with very long hair and long scopulas. 



Species of Becker. 



Agelena hentzi Becker. Fig. 42. 



Three specimens, one (a female) mature; a pale, motlerate-sized 

 specimen of .4. nwria. 



Singa van Bruysellii Becker. 



A male, but palpus is so bent under that I cannot see the structure. 

 The head is prominent, projecting in front; femur I is hairy, with 

 only a few spines, none as long as the width of the joint; this joint 

 is very dark near the tip, darkening gradually from near the base^ 

 which is pale, ^'enter has four white spots, two a little before the 

 spinnerets and surrounded by black, and one each side of the lung- 

 .slits, further apart than the other two. 



Theridium glaucescens Becker. 



Two specimens (females); it is what Keyserling has so identified, 

 and is not uncommon in the Atlantic States.

 with a narrow median pale line from eye-region. .\t)domen with 

 outline of a basal spear-mark, and irregular dark spots behiml; 

 venter heavily spotted. Legs pale, not distinctly marked, not very 

 long; steriunn dark, with a median pale strijie not reaching to the tip. 

 Lyoosa ezalbida Becker. 



This has been reconletl from the United States, but erroneously; 

 it is from Brazil; it looks nmch like a half-grown Aniom cinerea. 

 There is a spine at middle above on tibia^ III and I\', but none at the 

 base.

Species of Koch. 

 Corinna tricolor Koch. 



One female, A. M. E. closer to A. S. E. than to each other, P. M. E. 

 about three diameters apart, closer to P. S. E. A distinct species. 

 Corinna amoena Koch. 



A female is ornata Htz. Cephalothorax reddish, femur I blackish, 

 hind tibia and patella banded. 

 Corinna cingulata Koch. 



Two females are hivitlata Keys.; two bands on abdomen, hind legs 

 lined, femur I dark on base, rest pale. 



Megalostrata venifica Karsch. 



One male: a tooth at base of fang, two large teeth on the paturon, 

 outer one curved forward; tibial process of male palpus is about 

 three times as long as broad, as broad at tip as at base, the tip ob- 

 liquely truncate. 



Xysticus Inctans Koch. 



Not in the Berlin Museum, although there are several species 

 from Carolina, but not labelled, as Momachoms, gulosus, and Coria- 

 rachne versicolor. 



Agelena pennsylvanica Koch. 



Three specimens; are our common A. nwria, one is a good-sized, 

 well-marked female, the two others are not mature. 

 Teratodes depressus Koch 



I did not find in the Berlin collection, but there is no doubt as to 

 what it is from the figure and description. 



Paohygnatha tristriata Koch. 

 P. xanthostoma Koch. 



In the Berlin Museum are four specimens behind a label "Pennsyl. 

 Zimm.," but no species label, these are his tristriala according to the 

 description, and are what Emerton has so identified. 



Following this is a label "tristriata" and " Pennsyl. Zimm."; 

 behind these labels are seven specimens of our P. brevis. There are 

 no other American Pachygnatha in the collection. The name 

 labels have been put on after Koch's time, the locality labels are 

 original. It is therefore evident that the label "tristriata" has been 

 misplaced, and that the seven specimens labelled "tristriata" are 

 Koch's xanthostoma, .since they agree with his dc-^cription, and that 

 P. xanthostoma is P. brevis.

1913.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 189 



ON A COLLECTION OF BIRDS OBTAINED BY THE FRANCIS E. BOND EXPEDI- 

 TION IN THE ORINOCO DELTA AND PARIA PENINSULA. VENEZUELA- 



BY WITMER STONE. 



During the early part of 1911 Mr. Francis E. Bond conducted 

 an expedition to the coast of Venezuela, mainly in the delta of the 

 Orinoco. He was accompanied by Messrs. Stewardson Brown, Con- 

 servator of the Botanical Section of the Academy, and Thomas S. 

 Gillin, of Ambler, Pa. 



Among the collections obtained by the expedition and generously 

 presented bj- 'Sir. Bond to the Academy is a series of 504 bird skins, 

 prepared almost entirely by Mr. Gillin from specimens shot by 

 himself and other members of the partj-. 



It has been my privilege to study this collection, a complete list 

 of which is presented herewith. 



In order to better understand the relative position of the several 

 localities, I have drawn up a brief itinerary of the expedition from 

 notes furnished me by Mr. Brown. 



Starting from Port of Spain, Trinidad, the party crossed to the 

 peninsula of Paria, stopping at Cariaquito on the south shore. 

 Collecting was carried on here January 13-22, mainly close to the 

 coa.st and never more than a mile or two inland. Crossing the gulf, 

 they stopped at Pedernales, January 25-27, and then sailed up the 

 Vagre River, a sort of confluence of several .streams, and thence up 

 the Guanipa, arriving at the village of that name on February 2. 

 On February 0, they returned to the Vagre, and on the 8th went up 

 the Manimo to the mouth of the Uracoa, which they reached on 

 February 10. They then ascended this stream to La Pedrita, where 

 they remained February 12-18, and then returning to the Manimo 

 followed it to Tucapeta, some forty miles from the Orinoco itself. 

 Here they spent February 22-23, and then returned down the Manimo 

 to Pedernales, stopping at the Corisal, February 25-28, and reaching 

 the coast on March 4. Thence they returned to Cariaquito, where 

 they stopped March 10 18 to make additional collections before 

 crossing to Trinidad. 



In a region so long familiar to bird coll('ct(jrs as the Orinoco delta 

 it is not suri)rising that no new forms were obtained, but some of the 




190 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



records both from this district and from Cariaquito considerably 

 extend the range of the species, and in view of the lack of definite 

 localities in the case of early collections, the present list will, it is 

 hoped, be of value in ascertaining the exact range of the various 

 Venezuelan species. 



It will be noticed that 101 species were oljtaineil only at localities 

 in the delta country, while 48 were found only at Cariaquito on the 

 Paria peninsula, and 23 were found in both regions. These figures 

 mean little, however, as the collection is not sufficiently comprehen- 

 sive to warrant any general deductions on distribution. A certain 

 number of the Cariaquito species, such as Crypturus columbianus, 

 Ceryle americana, Microrhopias grisea intermedia, Dendrocincla 

 mendoides phceochroa, Myiozetetes similis columbianus, Chiroxiphia 

 Umceolata, ThryophUus j-ufalbus castanonotis, Pachysylria auranliifrons 

 saturata, CompsothyJypis pitiayumi elegans, Basileutei-us auricapillus 

 olivascens, Tanagra trinitatis, Tangara desmerestii, and Icterus auri- 

 capillus, are mainly restricted to the mountainous north coast of 

 Venezuela, extending eastward from Colombia. There are, however, 

 many others taken only at Cariaquito which are well known to 

 range also over the delta region. Notes on the color of the tarsi, 

 irides, etc., have been taken from Mr. Gillin's labels, while a few 

 notes on distribution and abundance received from ]\Ir. Brown bear 

 his initials.

NOTES ON SERPENTS IN THE FAMILY COLUBRIDS:. 

 BY JOSEPH C. THOMPSON, SURGEON, U. S. N. 



It is a curious fact that during the last two decades one of the 

 rarest things in the literature dealing with serpents is a detailed 

 account of an individual specimen. Reference is not made to 

 original descriptions of a type, as the majoritj- of these are full and 

 satisfactory, but anj-thing like the records left by Dumeril and Bibron 

 or by Cope of a particular specimen are now made by few authors. 

 The need for them is a very real one, both to students of zoogeography 

 in their efforts to outline the distribution of allied forms, and to those 

 engaged in the gathering of data relating to the range of variation 

 exhibited bj^ a given species.

 tip of the liver at the 39th gastrostege. 



Habitat. — Previously known from three specimens secured on 

 Busuanga Island, Calamianes Group, Philippine Islands. 



This species as at present defined cannot be separated from 0. 

 vertebralis by any single isolated character. The few specimens 

 recorded show that the one to which Boettger's description applies 

 may be distinguishetl from a typical 0. nrtcbralii< in the following 

 details: internasal suture shorter than the prefrontal: lateral borders 

 of the frontal converge posteriorly, instead of being iiarallel: loreal 

 broader than deep: two posterior temporals, sixth supralabial lower 

 and not reaching to the sujierior-posterior temporal; the vcrtel)ral 

 series of spots are much smaller and the transverse rows of minute 

 dots are more distinct. The.^e differences are each well within the 

 range of individual variation. The most pronounced character is 

 the absence of the large spots on the back of the adult (). schadenbergi, 

 but it does not hold for the young. The distribution of the two 

 broadly overlap in the Southern Philippines. .\s more spirimens 

 are secured there will probably be found examples that will form a 

 complete intermediate series.

THE ANTENODAL RETICULATION OF THE WINGS OF AGRIONINE 

 DRiVGONFLIES. 



BY HERBERT CAMPION. 



When describing the remarkaljle fossil dragonfly Phenacolestes 

 viirandus, from Florissant, Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell laid stress upon 

 its possession of five antenodal nervures, and, upon the strength of 

 that character alone, proposed to erect Phenncolesles — together with 

 Di/sagrion, also from the North American Tertiaries — into a new 

 subfamily of Agrionidse, the Dysagrionina;.' " Dysagrion Scudder, 

 the type of .the subfamily," he wrote, "has not been supposed to 

 possess an unusual number of antenodals, but it is evidently allied to 

 Phenacolestes, which has five; and Scudder's figure of Dysagrion 

 fredericii shows two antenodals beyond the arculus, and as the first 

 two of all Agrionids must certainly have been present, there were at 

 least four." In the description of Phenacolestes mirandiis it is stated: 

 "Antenodal sectors five, of which only the first two continue to the 

 radius, these being the two present in Agrioninae. The second, 

 however, does not meet, or nearly meet, the arculus, but ends on the 

 radius 204/^ beyond it (a character also of Melanngrion)." On the 

 same occasion Prof. Cockerell described the apical half of a wing, 

 also from the Tertiary of Florissant, as Phenacolestes parellelus, but 

 expressed a doubt as to the true generic position of the fossil. Sub- 

 sequently, he recorded the base of a wing having six antenodal 

 cross-nervures, which he referred provisionally to the same species.^ 



In the typical Agrionine wing we find two antenodals only, which 

 cross transversely lioth the costal and subcostal spaces; one of them 

 is placed before and the other at the level of the arculus. In fact, 

 so general is this number of antenodals in the Agrionimr, tiiat for 

 many years it was one of the chief characters used in sei)arating that 

 subfamily Ivnui the ('alopteryginie, in which tiic antenodals are more 

 munerous. In a few recent Agrionines, however, three, or even five, 

 antenodals occur witii more or less constancy, and we are thcrcfon" 

 no longer able to regard antenodal reticulation as a character of

primarj' importance in the classification of the Zygoptera. Super- 

 numerary antenodals are often weaker than the normal ones, and are 

 frequently incomplete; that is to say, they may appear as short 

 nervures crossing the costal space alone or the subcostal space aloue. 



As already remarked, the second antenodal coincides with the 

 arculus in the typical Agrioninae, but in such genera as Agriocnemis. 

 Argioaiemis, Ccratura, and Hemiphlebia, it comes before the level of 

 the arculus, while it lies beyond it in the fossil genera Melanagrion 

 and Phenacolcstes: 



In N^eurolestes trinervis De Selys, from Kamerun, we get three 

 complete antenodals constantly pre.sent, and, according to its de- 

 scriber, the supernumerary nervure is placed between the usual two. 

 Xeuragrion mysticum Karsch was described from a single 9 from 

 Ecuador, and here again there is an additional nervure Ij' ing between 

 the ordinary ones. But in this case the nervure is confined to the 

 hind-wings and to the subcostal space only. Of Thaitmatoneura, 

 from Central America, two .species are kno^^^l, namely, T. rnopinata 

 McLach. and T. pellucida Calv. In this genus a fourth, or even a 

 fifth, antenodal i.s occasionally added to the more usual number of 

 three, antl in some instances the number is reduced to two. The 

 third, fourth, and fifth antenodals, when present, are placed beyond 

 the level of the arculus and are confined to the costal space. Podop- 

 teryx roseonotala De Selys is represented in the British INIuseum 

 Collection by three specimens, namely, the type cf , obtained in .\ru 

 by A. R. Wallace, and a fine pair (cT & 9 ) from Queensland (F. P. 

 Dodd). The Australian examples do not possess more than two 

 antenodals in any of their wings, but the tj-pe specimen has a third 

 antenodal in each wing, beyond the level of the arculus, and crossing 

 the costal space only in three wings, and both the costal and subco.stal 

 spaces in the remaining wing. Furthermore, in three wings there 

 is a transverse nervure traversing the suljcostal space alone before 

 the first regular antenodal. 



Although the South African genus Chlorolestes does not normally 

 possess more than two cros.s-veins before the nodus, there are two 

 specimens in the British Museum Collection which exhibit a third 

 cross-vein. One of these insects is a cf of C. longicanda Burm., in 

 the right hind-wing of which the additional nervure is placed between 

 the usual two and ceases at the subcosta. The other is a cf of 

 C.fasciata De Selys, and in this case the added nervure, which ceases 

 at the subcosta, lies before the first normal antenodal in the right 

 hind-wing. 




222 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



Two Neotropical genera occasionally present similar featuri's to 

 those observed in Chlorolestes. The Godman-Salvin Collection of 

 Central American Odonata, now in the British Museum, includes 

 the type and three other specimens of Paraphlebia quinta Calv., all 

 from Guatemala. Two of these have an additional antenodal in as 

 many as five out of their eight wings, and in each instance it is 

 proximal to the first regular antenodal and is restricted to the sub- 

 costal space. A 9 of Heteragrion chrysops Hag., from Xera Cruz, 

 also in the Godman-Salvin Collection, has, in three of its wings, a 

 supernumerary antenodal between the usual ones and limited to the 

 costal space. 



All the recent species which have been considered so far belong to 

 De Selys' Legion Podagrion, a group which has been declared to be 

 "heterogeneous and untenable," but which includes the most archaic 

 genera of Agrioninae that have yet been made known. However, 

 at least two species belonging to the more highly specialized genera 

 may be cited as affording other instances of the accidental reappear- 

 ances of the kind under review. One of these is the type 9 of 

 Ischnura granii IMcLach., from Sokotra, preserved in the British 

 Museum, in which a third antenodal is present in all the wings, except 

 the right fore-wing. In each case it is placed beyond the level of the 

 arculus and ends on the subcosta. The other .species referred to is 

 Pijrrhosoma nymphula Sulz., concerning which Prof. Philip P. Calvert 

 is kind enough to inform me that he possesses a 9 from Birmingham, 

 Warwickshire, taken by Mr. W. H. Bath, whose left fore-wing has 

 three antenodals, the third lying beyond the usual two and crossing 

 the costal space only. 



It is not improbable that tiu' supernumerary antenodals which we 

 have found to occur sporadically, as an inilividual peculiarity, repre- 

 .'sent nervures which were present normally in the wings of .some 

 ancestral form, but which have been lost in the majority of living 

 Agrioninie. The main tendency of Agrionine development has lieen 

 in the direction of simjjlified wing-venation, and in the more highly 

 specialized genera the costal and subcostal spaces have shared in the 

 general elimination of superfluous cross-veins. As soon as the 

 number of antenodals had been reduced to two, however, specializa- 

 tion in this direction appears to have cea.sed, for no Agrionine is known 

 having fewer than two complete cross-veins, except in rare eases of 

 individual aberration. In this connection it will be useful to quote 

 some remarks made by Prof. Calvert respecting two Mexican speci- 

 mens of hchnnra denlicoUis Burm., which arc in the following terms: 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 223 



"Two abnormalities in venation may be mentioned here: One 

 male fromPatzcuaro has only one antecubital on the right hind-wing^ 

 situated at the level of the submedian cross-vein. One female from 

 Orizaba has the first antecubital on the right hind-wing only about 

 as far from the second as the costal space is wide, and it crosses only 

 the costal, not the subcostal, space. "^ In consequence of the dis- 

 continuous antenodal in the 9 , which I have seen, and the single 

 antenodal in the cf lying on the level of the cubito-anal cross-vein 

 in each case, I regard both of them as occupying the intermediate 

 position between the two normal antenodals of Agrioninje. 



If this view should prove to be well-founded, it would follow that 

 we have evidence of the former existence of at least seven antenodals. 

 of which the second and fourth alone persist in the greater number of 

 recent Agrioninge. In a hypothetical wing, including all the antenodal 

 cross-veins of which indications have so far been afforded by mor- 

 phologj' and teratology, the fourth antenodal is that which coincides 

 with the arculus, and this fact enables one to recognize it in all other 

 Agrionine wings. It is also comparatively easy to determme, in any 

 given case, the identity of each of the three antenodals which precede 

 it. But at present I can discover no means of ascertaining the exact 

 homology of the antenodals lying beyond the level of the arculus 

 which occur occasionally in one or two recent genera. 



In our reconstructed wing, then, we have seven antenodal cross- 

 veins, disposed in the following manner: Xos. 1, 2, and 3 placed 

 before the level of the arculus: Xo. 4 coinciding more or less exactly 

 with the arculus, and Xos. .5, 6, and 7 lying between the level of the 

 arculus and the nodus. Arranging in tabular form the material 

 which we have had under review, we get this result:

Although Phenacolestes parallelus is believed to have had six 

 antenodal cross-veins, it has not been possible to place it in the 

 table, as no information has been given concerning the position of 

 the veins in relation to the arculus. 



Looking at the number and arrangement of the antenodal nervures 

 alone, and without having regard to anj' other considerations, it 

 would appear that among recent genera Thaumatoneura bears the 

 closest resemblance to Phenacolestes. Moreover, this resemblance 

 is accentuated when, as sometimes happens, a fourth, or even a fifth, 

 antenodal is present. But of course the venation of the spaces lying 

 between the nodus and the base of the wing is only one of many 

 characters which must be studied in attempting to arrive at the true 

 affinities of Phenacolestes, and for the present it is perhaps advisable 

 to retain in the subfamily Agrionime this and other genera associated 

 with it. 



In conclusion, I have to thank Professor Calvert for his kindness 

 in suggesting amendments to this paper, and jiarticularly for drawing 

 my attention to the two Mexican specimens of Ischnura denticollis 

 recorded by him. and furnishing me with information respecting the 

 British 9 of Pyrrho.'<om(i nymidiula contained in his own collection.

Phenacolestes M.^teri.\.l Studied. 



In 1908, Profe.s.sor T. D. A. Cockerell described (1908a) two .species 

 of fossil Odonata from Station 14, Florissant, Colo., as Phena- 

 colestes mirandus and P/i.(?) parallelus. A little later (19086) he 

 added a note based on an additional fragment which he referred to 

 the latter species, and in another place (1908f) he gave a figure 

 showing the body as well as the wings, the previous accounts having 

 referred to the wings only. In connection with the original flc.-;crip- 

 tion he quotes from a letter from Professor Xeedham wiio ahnost 

 implies that Ph. inimndus is to be placed in de Selys' legion Podagrion 

 of the Agrioninie 1 1908o, p. 63). 



In the latter i)art of 1910, Professor Cockerell wrote to me that 

 he had found more wings of Phenacolestes, and requested me to study 

 them, in view of some differences of opinion as to its relationship to 

 modern dragonflies. 



\Mien I accepted this offer, Profe.s.sor Cockerell sent me four 




226 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



specimens of these fossil wings which, for reference liere, I have 

 numbered as follows: 



No. 1. Labelled " Phenacolestes mirandus Ckll. Florissant," in 

 Professor Cockerell's handwriting; 27 mm. long from base to apex. 



No. 2. LaheWed " Phenacolestes mimndus CkW. Florissant Sta. 12 B 

 (G. N. Rohwer)," in the same hand. Apparently a hind wing. 

 Distorted, length from base to apex as it lies on the stone 26 mm. 



Nos. 3 and 4. Unlabelled. [These are the two impressions of the 

 same wing, and were collected by Geo. N. Rohwer. T. D. A. Gock- 

 erell.] Apparently a front wing. Length of No. 3 from base to apex 

 28 mm. ; of No. 4 (apex lost) from base to distal end of stigma 25 mm. 



They are figured from enlarged photographs on Plate XIV as fig- 

 ures 1-4. 



The beautiful preservation of these wings has rendered possible 

 the drawing up of almost as full a description of the venation as for 

 any living species. 



Professor Cockerell has very kindly presented specimen No. 3 

 to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia; the other three 

 specimens will be returned to him. 



Thanks to the kindness of Dr. F. A. Bather, through the good 

 offices of Mr. C. J. Gahan, I have also studied two fossils of this 

 insect in the British Museum of Natural History, when in London 

 in August, 1912. One of these, catalogued as "No. I 8423," is the 

 paratype of Professor Cockerell's original description of Phcnacolestea 

 miramlus. The other, "No. I 15,049," is labelled in Professor Cock- 

 erell's handwriting " Phenacolestes mirandus Ckll. Florissant Sta. 

 13 B (S. A. Rohwer)." No. I 8423 measures 20.5 mm. in length 

 from the wing-base to the proximal end of the stigma; the distal 

 part of the stigma and the tip of the wing are lacking; the nodus is 

 9 mm. from the base. No. I 15,049 has lost the stigma and apex of 

 the wing from the distal end of M2 forward (cephalad and distad) 

 and the extreme hind margin between the apices of M2 and Cui; 

 its length along the costa as preserved is 23 mm., the nodus i-; 10 mm. 

 from base. 



Use has also been made of an exc'cllcnt photograph, for which 1 

 thank Professor Cockerell and Dr. Max M. Ellis, of the University 

 of Colorado, of an almost perfect wing from the same locality as 

 that of the second specimen ([uoted in the preceding jiaragraph. 

 This photograph is reproduced as figure 5 on Plate XI\' accompany- 

 ing this paper; it will be designated as No. 5 in these pages and 

 apparently represents a front wing.

The following account is based, therefore, on six wings in seven 

 impressions. 



Throughout this paper the Comstock-Xeedham nomenclature 

 for the wing-veins has been employed. In the previous literature 

 on the living members of the legion Podagrion the Selysian terms 

 have been used. The equivalents of the two systems are therefore 

 appended here.

 from nodus to stigma. (In No. 5, however, the distance is 

 only .28, in No. I 8423 B. M. it is .26.) 



10. Between 'SI2 and Rs is one row of cells increasing to two and then 



three rows, and so continuing to the margin. 



11. Rs separates from ^Ii + 2 at the subnodus. (Xos. 3. 4, 5, and 



B. M. I 15,049 show this clearly; B. M. I 8423 apparently 

 agrees with them; Xo. 1 has the point of separation slightly 

 proximal to the subnodus, while in No. 2 this part is indis- 

 tinguishable.) 



12. Between Rs and IM3 is one row of cells, increasing to two and then 



to three rows of cells.

from arculus to subnodus.

the level of the subnodus,' and (6) at the wing-margin are 4-5 

 rows of cells.

diverging caudad and (b) its distal side more than one-and

of cells (three rows in B. M. Xo. I 15,049). 



20. Area posterior to Cu2 without distinct branches, but with three

Compared with Professor Cockcrcll's original dcscriiitiou of 

 Phrnacolpstes inimmhiti (1908a, p. 61), the present material shows the 

 following differences: 



Antenodal cross-veins'* four in some specimens instead of five. 



Basal space (i.e., cell Mi-i) 4 mm. long, instead of nearly 5 mm. 



» For B. M. No. I 8423 I have even noted, "Arculus very slightly more distal 

 than midway between the two normal antenodals." 



" The second, or distal, of these is actually at the subnodus in the two Britisb 

 M\iseum specimens. 



' Prof. Cockrrell speaks of antenodal and i)ostnodal scdurs meaning these 

 erOKS-vcins. 'Ihis word is not in accordance with tlie usage of other authors on 

 the Odonata. Ka in tlic same (icscripliim should be H».

Quadrangle with its upper side distinctly shorter than the lower 

 side. 



Ms separating from yii+2 at 3.5-4 mm. from the arculus, 2.5-1 mm. 

 from level of nodus. 



Postnodal cross-veins'* 17-19, instead of 21. 



Stigma bounding 31 or -i§ cells above, preservation imperfect in 

 most of these specimens. 



Ml and M2 separating at as much as 10.75 mm. from arculus, 

 instead of 9.67 mm. 



Beyond the quadrangle, i.e., between ^l* and Cui, are seventeen 

 single cells (Nos. 3 and 4), or si.xteen (No. 5), then two rows increa.s- 

 ing; hence very different from Prof. Cockerell's statement, p. 62, 

 which does not seem to agree with his figure (13 of Plate V). 



There is but one row of cells between Mi and Mm throughout, thus 

 agreeing with the de.scription of P/i.(?) -parallelus (I.e., p. 62) in 

 distinction from Ph. mirandus. 



Two specimens, Nos. 1 and 3, are sufficiently preserved to enable 

 a count of the cells between M2 and Rs to be made. From the margin 

 proximad these are, in No. 1, 7 marginal cells, then 3 rows for 3-4 

 cells, then 2 rows for 6 cells, then 1 row (which is consequently met 

 at 10-11 cells in from the margin), this single row comprising about 

 15 cells to the origin of Rs, three of the.se 15 being basad of the origin 

 of M2. Corresponding figures for specimen No. 3 are 5 (?) marginal 

 cells, then 3 rows for 4 cells, then 2 rows for 3 cells, then 1 row (which 

 is consequently met at 8 cells in from the margin), this single row 

 comprising about 20 cells to the origin of Rs, 5| of these 20 being 

 basad of the origin of M2. In B. M. No. I 8423, this single row 

 consists apparently of 15 cells, 4 of which are basad of the origin of 

 M2. In B. M. No. I 15,049, this single row con.si.sts of 15 or 16 cells, 

 3 and the greater part of the fourth of which are basad of the origin 

 of M2; No. 5 appears to be very similar. None of these arrange- 

 ments is identical with that described for Ph. mirandus, where, 

 however, the single row of cells is met at 11 cells in from the margin. 

 Prof. Cockerell gives two formulie for Ph. mirandus and P/l(?) 

 parallelus, respectively (I.e., p. 62), these formulae being obtained by 

 taking "a section of the wing down from the basal part of the stigma 

 to Cu2, and count[ingl the numbers of rows of cells successively met 

 between the longitudinal veins ■. . . . commencing with that 

 between Ri and Mi." The numbers of cells so obtained will depend 

 on the exact position of the line of section, but Prof. Cockerell does 

 not specify this. Choosing, as the two points fixing this line, the 




230 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [MaV, 



inferior proximal angle of the stigma and the point where Cu2 meets 

 the hind wing-margin, the following formulae for the present material 

 were obtained: 



No. 1: 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2. 



Xo. 2: (too imperfect). 



No. 3: 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2. 



Xo. 4: 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2. 



Xo. 5: 1. 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2. 



Xo. I 15,0-19: 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2. 



We have here two different formulae, neither of which agree with 

 either of Prof. Cockerell's formulae. 



Guided hy the amount of variation in venational details of one 

 and the same living .species of Agrioninae, I am of the opinion that 

 the differences shown by the present material, inter se and from 

 Prof. Cockerell's data, do not justify the specific separation of the 

 specimens liefore me from Ph. tnirandus. 



All of the present material show more or less distinctly the dark 

 band across the wing, described l)y Prof. Cockerell; it is best illu.s- 

 trated in our figure 5. 



Phenacolestes agrees with the venational characters of the legion 

 Podagrion, as stated by de Selys in 188G,' with the one exception 

 that the wings are not "petiolees beaucoup plus loin que la nervule 

 ba.sale postcostale." I think that there can be no doubt that its 

 nearest living allies are to be found in this group. I have therefore 

 made comparisons with a number of genera of this legion, especially 

 American, with the results set forth below. As I have had only 

 five of the fossil wings and photographs of one other before me and 

 am unable to determine whether all of them are of the fore or hind 

 pairs, I have not thought it necessary to employ any great numb(>r 

 of specimens of the living species for these comparisons.

Comparison of Th.^umatoneura (inopinata and pellucida) 



WITH PhENACOLESTES. 



{Th. inopinata cf 9, Th. pellucida cf, Costa Rica). 



These two genera agree in the characters above numbered 2, 11, 

 14 (except as noted below), and 21a. As regards character 11, the 

 separation point of Rs in Thaumatoneura varies and may be a little 

 proximal to, at, or a little distal to, the subnodus. 



The two genera differ in characters given below; after each number 

 the difference shown bj' Thaumatoneura is stated: 



1. Nodus at about one-fifth of the wing-length. 



3. Postnodals very numerous, about 70.

the hind margin of wing. 



7. The one row of cells between iNIi and Mia increases to about 



10 rows at the wing-margin. 



8. The one row of cells between Alio and Mi increases to 6-|- rows

14. Ms separates from Mn-2 at a less acute angle. 



15. Between Ms and Mi, (a) no cros.s-veins proximal to the level of

16. Quadrilateral with (a) its proximal and distal sides subparallel 



and (6) subecjual. 



17. Between Mi and Cui are (a) 3-6 antenodal cells and [b) at the 



wing-margin 8-|- rows of cells. 



18. Cubito-anal cross-veins two, one proximal to the level of the 



first antenodal cross-vein, the other below the middle of the 

 (juadrilateral.

20. Area posterior to Cus much larger, Cua with many branches. 

 216. Anal vein separates from the hind margin of the wing distad to 



the level of the proximal cubito-anal cross-vein. 

 22. Anal cross-veins proximal to the level f)f the distal end of the

Relationships of Thaum.a.toneura. 



Some words may be added here as to the retention of Thaumato- 

 neura in this group after the diverging opinions of Professors Needham 

 and Foerstor. The late Mr. McLachlan, on describing Thaumalj- 




234 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



neura (1897), referred it to the Calo])teryginte. In 1902, I placed 

 it in the legion Podagrion of the Agrioninit. '" In 1903. Professor 

 Needham associated it with the Anormostigmatini ( = legion 

 Pseudostigma of Selys), stating that "it has all the essential vena- 

 tional characters of this group, and surely these are sufficientl}' 

 distinctive."" A comparison of Thaumatoneiira with these essential 

 venational characters'* gives the following result. 



Thaumatoncura agrees with the Anormostigmatini in that R» 

 separates from M1+2 at or very close to the subnodus and the part 

 of the wing beyond the nodus is greatly enlarged. On the other hand, 

 Thaunuitoncum differs from the Anormostigmatini in that, while the 

 stigma is not braced, it is not diffuse or lost ; the matching of cross- 

 veins is not so marked; the longest vein between Mi and M2, which, 

 in the preceding pages, we have assumed to be ISIki, does not parallel 

 M2 more than it parallels ^^Ii and lies almost midway between Mi 

 and ^h; it has shorter supplemeutarj- sectors between itself and Mi 

 and also between itself and AL; these latter tend to be longer and 

 better developed than those anterior to Mm, and in this Thaumato- 

 neura resembles Paraphlebia and differs from the Anormostigmatini. 

 This tendency to the development of more rows of cells between 

 Mia and M2 than between Mi and Mm is emphasized in Philogenia 

 carriUica, P. lerraba, Heteragrion triceUidare, H. erythroyastnim and 

 Argiok'.'itc'i ictcromelas which have no supplementarj- sectors between 

 Ml and Mm. but two between Mm and M:; all these are Podagrionines. 

 Even in more reduced venations of the same group, as in Allopoda- 

 grion there are no supplementary sectors between Mi and Mm, but 

 still one between Mm and Ma. On the other hand, even in Anormos- 

 tigmatini with the most reduced venation, e.g., Mecistogosler, there 

 is a longer supplementary sector between Mi and Mm than between 

 Mm and M2. Professor Needham himself has pointed out some 

 further differences of Thaumatoncura from Megaloprepus, and still 

 others may be added. Thus the nodus and quadrilateral (quad- 

 rangle) are no more appro.ximated in Thaumaloncura than in many 

 other undoubted members of the legion Podagrion (See Table I, 

 p. 250, posted). Thaumaloneura po.s.sesses more supplementary 

 sectors lietween M2 anil R. and between R. and Ma. I believe, 

 therefore, that Thaumatoncura shows more resemblances to the 

 legion Potlagrion than to the legion Pseudostigma, but it does not

seem impossible that the Anormostigmatini may have descended 

 from some form hke Thaumatoneura. 



Professor Foerster considers Thaumatoneura as a connecting form 

 between the Calopterygins and the legion Podagrion, "which is 

 better left with the Calopteryginse." "Bei .... Thamnato- 

 neura ist der aussere Ast des Sector inferior trianguli convex nach 

 vorn gebogen wie bei alien echten Calopterygiden. Bei alien 

 Agrioninen i.st er dagegen schwach convex nach hinten."" Many 

 Calopteryginse (Selys) have not Cu2 convex anteriorly, of course, 

 such as Micromerus, Rhinocypha h'forata and other species, Libellago, 

 etc., but perhaps these are not "echt." On the other hand, such 

 Agrionines as Megaloprepus, Microstigma, and Paraphlebia also have 

 Cu2 convex anteriorly, while a tendency in the same direction is 

 observable in Argiolestes and even in Hyponeura, so that I cannot 

 see that any strong argument for the Calopterygine affinities of 

 Thaumatoneura can be drawn from this character.

3. Postnodals 22-30. 



8. Between M\a and M2 is at first but one row of cells which, more 



distad, is increa.sed to two and then to three rows by the 

 presence of two distinct curvilinear {i.e., not broken) supple-

 anterior; each of these three rows increases to a double row 

 before reaching the wing-margin at an individually variable 

 distance tluM-efrom.

 further in this connection: Xeurolestes Selys, Xesok^tes Selys, 

 Podolestes Selys and Synlestes iielys. It may be notetl. however, 

 that in Xeurolestes trinervis Selys, from Old Calaljar, the three

General Discussion of the Value of the Venatioxal Charac- 

 ters COMPARED IN THE PRECEDING CiENER.A FOR THE 



Determination of Relationships. 



Manj- of the ideas which have been expressed on the changes 

 which have taken place in the venation of Odonate wings have been 

 based on the comparative morphology of living representatives of 

 the order or on considerations of mechanical advantage. It does 

 not follow that these foundations are trustworthy or that there has 

 always been mechanical improvement in the wings. Degeneration 

 is just as probable as progressive development. The actual course 

 of phylogeny cannot be deduced from these considerations or from 

 the data of morphology. It seems therefore desirable to attempt to 

 ascertain what paleontological evidence exists affording clues to the 

 descent of these insects, by tracing the modifications which the wings 

 exhibit from the Carboniferous period down to the present time. 



The characters of Phenacolestes and other genera which have been 

 compared in the preceding pages under the numbers 1 to 22 may for 

 the most part be arranged into two groups: 



A. Those characters which are concerned with the positions of 

 the points of separation of longitudinal veins and the positions and , 

 number of certain cross-veins. 



B. Those characters which are concerned with the numlier of rows 

 of cells existing between the longitudinal veins and their branches. 



Group A includes numbers 1, 2, .3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15«, 16, 17a, 

 18, 21, and 22. 



1. The Position of the Xodus. — The Protodoiiata of the Carl)onifer- 

 ous and the Permian possessed no nodus; their subcosta (whose apex 

 in the Odonata usually coincides with the nodus) reached often beyond 

 mid-length of the; wing, its minimal extent being to four-tenths of 

 the wing-length in Meganeurula (Handlirsch^-). The earliest of 



" Fobs. Ins., p. .309, Taf. XXXI, figs. .37, 38. 




246 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [^la.V, 



the known Odonata, from the Lias, have been segregated by Hand- 

 lirsch as a suborder, distinct from the existing Zygoptera and Anisop- 

 tera, under the name Anisozygoptera. ^' These insects usually 

 possessed a nodus which lay at about mid-length of the wing. Hand- 

 lirsch considers^^ that, of the recent forms, the Gomphidae and 

 CalopterygidiB have unquestionably the closest relations to the 

 Anisozygoptera and are probalily direct descendants thereof. The 

 Agrioniniie of Selys have usually been looked on as descendants of 

 Calopterygid(or -gine)-like forms. ^^ The position of the nodus in 

 Calopterygmte and in Agrioninse, respectively, has been stated as. 

 follows: 



"The position of the nodus varies in both tlie Calopterygins and 

 the Agrioninse, but in general it is farther from the base of the wing 

 in the former than in the latter. Among the first-named it is probably 

 nearest the base (one-third the wing-length) in Amphipteryx and in 

 Chalcopteryx,^ among the second group it is farthest from the base 

 (more than one-third the wing-length) in Archilestes. No Calop- 

 terj'gina^ have the nodus as near to the base as one-fifth the wing- 

 length, but many Agrionmse have it in that position.""" 



This statement was based on conditions existing in recent forms. 

 Very little is kno\ra of fossil Zygoptera of periods earlier than the 

 Eocene^^ when Dysagrion and fragments named Podagiion abortivum 

 by Scudder appear. From the Jurassic, Handlirsch lists^' Euph(Fopsis 

 multinerris Hagen, in fair preservation, and four possible Ijut inde- 

 cipherable sjiecies of P-seitdoeuphtea, all considered to be allied to the 

 living EpnUaye, Euphaa, etc., i.e., Calopterygina; of Selys. Eupha- 

 opsis multincrvis hatl the nodus at .44 of the wing-length. Another 

 fossil of the same age is Steleopteron deichmiilleri jilaced In' Hamllirsch

both Epallagid (Calopterygine) and Agrionine affinities. It had the 

 nodus at only three-tenths of the wing-length.* 



No Cretaceous Zygoptera are listed by Handlirsch. 



No ontogenetic data showing a proximal shifting in position of the 

 nodus in any Zygopteron seem to have been published. If the 

 evidence that may be drawn from the hj-pothetical descent of 

 Agrioninse (Selys) from Calopteryginae (Selys) be left out of con- 

 sideration, there j-et appears to be good paleontdlogical support, 

 as sketched above, for the statement of Needham^^ that shortening 

 of the subcosta and retraction of the nodus toward the base of the 

 wing is a developmental tendency away from the generalized con- 

 dition of a long subcosta and a nodus remote from the wing-base. 

 Yet it must be pointed that an upper Liassic fossil is known in 

 which the subcosta ends at only .15 of the wirig-length. This is 

 Prototnyrmeleon brunonis Geinitz, for which Handlirsch has erected 

 the suborder Archi-Zygoptera and which he even suggest.?^- maj- have 

 been a connecting link between the Protodonata and the Agrionidse 

 ( = Agrioninae Selys). Should such an ancestry for the latter group 

 ever be demonstrated, the retraction of the nodus in living Odonata 

 could not have the same .significance, as a sign of specialization, which 

 Needhara has given it. The alternative suggestion of Handlirsch, 

 that Protomijrmeleon is .simply an analogue to the Agrionidse (Agri- 

 oninse Selys) whose descendants have become extinct, seems at 

 present the more probable. 



2. The Number of Antenodal Cross-veins. — ^4 priori one might expect 

 retraction of the nodus to be accompanied by a decrease in the 

 number of antenodal cross-veins. No such proportional reduction 

 exists, however. The two Calopterygine genera cited on p. 246 anted 

 as having the most retracted nodus in that whole grouj), Chalcopteryx 



«» Still another Jurassic (Eichstadt) fossil is the Agrion eichslattense of Hagen, 

 listed by Handlirsch as \Ialmagrion eichslattense (Foss. Ins., p. 599). Hagen 

 says of it {Paleonlographica, X, p. 119, 1862): "Die Fliigel sind 21 mm. lang, 

 sehr schmal .... Der Xodus liegt 6 mm. von der Basis. Das Geader ist 

 nicht deutlich." His lithographic figure 5, Taf. XIV, agrees with these propor- 

 tions. 



Meunier (.-Inti. Soc. Ent. France, LXV, pi. 3, 1896) has given a figure labelled 

 ".\grion? eichstiit tense Hagen type." It is photographic and repre.sents an 

 insect lying in the same position a.s that of Ilagen's figure and of the same 

 natural size. From Meunier's figure the position of the nodus cannot be recog- 

 nized. In his text Meunier .says, |). 131, "Ayrion eichsUillense Hagen. No. 150.

ami Aitiphiptiryx, have respectively 23-26 (front wing), 21-23 (hind 

 wing), and 7-10 (front wing), 7-8 (hind wing) antenodals. The 

 paleontological 'evidence (with the exception of Protomyrmeleon, 

 which has but one antenodal), including Steleopteroii, is favorable to 

 the view that reduction in the number of antenodals is a more recent 

 acquisition. The preceding paper by ^Ir. Campion'^'' discusses in a 

 suggestive way the apparent evidence for such reduction afforded 

 by recent Agrioninae. 



3. The Xumher of Postiwdal Cross-veins. — Prof. Needham has 

 concluded" that one of the developmental tendencies of the Odonata 

 is: "Antenodal and postnodal cross- veins becoming reduced in 

 number, stronger, more regular, sometimes matched in position or 

 differentiated among themselves." In the Zygoptera this tendency 

 is more evident in the antenodals than in the postnodals, the latter 

 never becoming so few, ab.solutely, or relatively to the antenodals, 

 as in certain Anisoptera, e.g., Pachydiplax (front wing: antenodals 6, 

 postnodals 6) or Miathyria simpJe.r (front wing: antenodals 7, post- 

 nodals 5) . 



In the Protodonata, owing to the great extension of the subcosta 

 toward the apex of the wing, although there was no nodus, the 

 potential postnodals were less numerous than the actual antenodals, 

 assuming that the nodus of the Odonata developeil at, or but little 

 proximad to, the apex of the subcosta. With retraction of the nodus 

 a greater number of postnodals in the costal .space became possible. 

 Numerous cases of subsecpient reduction in the number doubtless 

 occurred independently of each other, but the paleontological data 

 are not sufficiently abundant to demonstrate progressive reduction 

 in any one line of descent, however likely this may appear from the 

 standpoint of mechanical advantage or of economy of vein-forming 

 material. 



4. The Pterostiyma. — The stigma is an Odonate feature not po.-*- 

 se.ssed by the Protodonata. In those Anisozygoptera, which are 

 considered by Handlirsch"* to be ancestfal to the Calojilerygida', 

 viz., the Tarsophlebiidip, the .'itigma was fairly olilitiue auil in one

Steleopteron, also of the same age, its proximal edge is not as oblique 

 as in Tarsophlebia eximia and mibraced while its distal edge is more 

 oblique. So far as one may judge from Handlirsch's figures" of 

 Liassic Odonata the stigma was not oblique, or but moderately so, 

 and unbraced; the forms in which it is preserved, however, seem to 

 have but little relationship to the insects discussed in this paper. 

 The paleontological evidence, therefore, furnishes little encouragement 

 to use the stigma as a means of determining relationships.*^' It is 

 important to notice, however, from the accompanying Table I, 

 that the position of the stigma in the wing varies but little in different 

 genera and species, so that it constitutes a relatively fixed landmark. 



9, 11. The Points of Separation of M2 from M\ and ofRsfrom Mi+i. — 

 Prof. Xeedham has notecP a minor line of development within the 

 Agrioninse, "in which nodus and quadrangle become more and more 

 approximate, and the veins M2, Rs, antl Ms migrate separately along 

 vein Ml from their accustomed places toward the stigma." This 

 migration may be real or apparent. Retraction of the nodus with 

 no change in position of the separation point of M2 would result in a 

 greater interval between nodus and M2 and henc^ an apparent 

 movement of the latter toward the stigma, but no real movement 

 in respect to the wing as a whole. (Compare Table I, Thaumato- 

 neura, Rhipidolestes and Paraphlebin zoe cf.) 



Real migration is where the separation-point of M.- is transferred 

 distad considered in relation to the total wing-length, and may or 

 may not be accompanied by a change in the position of the nodus. 

 (Compare Table I, Perilesies and Dysagrion, and Perilestes, Argio- 

 lestes icleromelas 9 and Melanagrion.) These remarks will also 

 apply to characters 11 (the separation-point of Rs, including its 

 bridge where it exists, from ^In-2), 14 (the separation-point of Ms 

 from M1+2), 15a (the number of cross-veins proximal to the level of 

 the subnodus between Ms and Mi) and 17« (the numljer of antenodal 

 cells between M4 and Cui). In the preceding pp. 228-244, the state- 

 ments for these characters have been mafle with reference, not to the 

 wing-length, but to certain more or less varying landmarks, as the 

 arcuius, nodus, or stigma; this course has been in conformity with 

 the established custom of descriptive writers.

The paleoutological evidence with reference to the separation- 

 points of M2, Rs and ^li i.s that the Lias.*ic fos.sils (with the exception 

 of Protomyrmeleon) had 'SU separating at the .subnodu?, and Rs 

 (including its bridge) and 'Sh proximad to the nodus;" none of these 

 fossils which have the nodal region preserved are considered by 

 Handlirsch to be ancestral to Zygoptera, however. For many of 

 the Jurassic remains'^ the same statement as to the positions of these 

 separation-points holds true, including Tarsophlebia exiniia and 

 Euphceopsis muUinervis; Steleopteron had R« and 'Sh arising well 

 proximad to the nodus, iSh onlj- a short di.stance distad to the nodus; 

 Palceophlebia synlestoides, which Brauer, Redtenbacher and Gangl- 

 bauer assigned to the legion Podagrion of Selys" liut which Hand- 

 lirsch regards as an Anisozygopter of doubtful position,™ is imperfectly 

 preserved, but seems to have had the origins of both R« and ^L 

 distinctly distal to the nodus, W"hile that of Ma was probably proximal 

 to the nodus. Paleophlebia came from the Dogger, or lower Jurassic, 

 of Siberia, and is therefore older than the other Jurassic fo.ssils just 

 referred to, all of which are ^lalm or Upper Jura. The paleoutological 

 evidence is consequently not altogether satisfactory and at least 

 admits of the possibility of the separation-points of these three veins 

 having fluctuated proximad or distad from time to time. Prof. 

 Needham's statement as to their migration, quoted above, has not 

 that evidence from other sources than comparative morphology 

 which is necessary to enable us to use these characters with perfect 

 confidence.

 is little reason for attaching any special phylogenetic value to it.

 above under Nos. 9, 11.) 



15fl. The Number of Cross-veins, Proximal to the Level of the Sub- 

 nodus, between Mi and Mt. — This character is closely dependent' on 

 No. 14, for the more proximal is the separation-point of ^h from M1+2, 

 the greater is the area available for these cross-veins. In the genera 

 here compared the greatest number of cross-veins, two, is found in 

 Phenacolestes, Lithaqrion, and Melanagrion, all of which have a more 

 proximal origin of Ms. The reverse case is not necessarily true, as 

 Philogenia, Allopodagrion, and Dysagrion, with an equally proximal

origin of ^h (see Table I), have but one such cross- vein. Tarsophlebia 

 eximia had five in its hind wing (these veins are not preserved in the 

 front wing) and Steleopteron had two. 



16. The Obliquity of the Quadrilateral. — The shape of the quadri- 

 hiteral becomes more oblique with the greater divergence of its 

 proximal and distal sides. Prof. Needham has assumed" that a 

 nearly rectangular quadrilateral, in which opposite sides are parallel 

 to each other, is the more primitive form and that from it at least 

 two kinds of oblique quadrilaterals have arisen. There seems to be 

 no published ontogenetic evidence in favor of this view and the only 

 paleontological evidence not contradicting it is limited to that 

 puzzling Liassic form, Protomyrmeleon, in which, if Handlirsch's 

 interpretation of the venation be correct,'* R and ]M are still distinct 

 from the base distad, and there is no trace of a beginning arculus. 



On the other hand, all the Jurassic fossils, which are not clearly 

 Anisoptera, show an oblique quadrilateral with its posterior distal 

 angle acute." This holds true not only for those fossils referred bj' 

 Handlirsch to the Zygoptera like Euphwopsis and Steleopteron, or 

 for forms regarded by him as ancestral to Zygoptera, as Tarsophlebia 

 (and including a Liassic fragment, T. westwoodi^) , but also for other 

 Anisozygoptera not apparently forefathers of the Zygoptera, as 

 Stenophlebia, Isophlebia, and Anisophlehia. Dysag7-ion of the Eocene 

 had an oblique quadrilat<>ral, and in fact not one of the published 

 descriptitms and figures of Tertiary Zygoptera listed byHandlirsch'" 

 shows a rectangular quadrilateral; all have it ol)li(iU('. 



It therefore seems necessary to regard the oblique quadrilateral 

 as the more primitive and the rectangular as a later appearance.

17fl. The Number of Antenodal Cells between Mi and Cm. — This 

 character is in general dependent on the degree of retraction of the 

 nodus, as the more the nodus approaches the base of the wing the 

 smaller is the area available for these cells. This correlation, although 

 not absolute and exact in the genera here compared, holds in a rough 

 way. We may therefore regard reduction in the number of antenodal 

 cells as a specialization. There appear to have been 12 on the front 

 wing, 13 on the hind ^-ing of Tarsophlebia exitnia (counting only a 

 single row — there are two rows in part of this area), almost three in 

 Steleopteron . A reduction in the number of antenodal cells maj- occur 

 independently of retraction of the nodus, however, by the greater 

 development of the quadrilateral distad. (Compare Table I, 

 Thaumatoneura and Paraphlebia, also pp. 233, 237 anted.) 



18. The Xumber of C ubito-anal Cross-veins. — These veins are usually 

 small and weak in the Zygoptera, and they have not been preserved 

 well in the fossils, so that few data on their development in point of 

 geologic time are available. Perhaps the same kind of evidence 

 which Mr. Campion has secured*^ for the reduction of the antenodals 

 might be obtained for these cross-veins also. It is conceivable that 

 the ancestral Zygopteron might have had a moderate number and 

 that some of its descendants might have acquired more, others fewer. 

 While recognizing the paucity of evidence, I am inclined to view 

 reduction in their number as specialization, in harmony with the 

 reduction of antenodals. 



21. Petiokition of the Wing. — When the anal vein (A) separates 

 from the hind margin of the wing at some distance from the base, a 

 stalk-like appearance of the wing-base is produced, especially on the 

 hind margin, to which the term ''petiolee" was long ago applied by 

 de Selys. Petiolation involves a reduction of the anal area and is 

 specifically mentioned by Prof. Xeedham^ as a fundamental develop- 

 mental tendency in the Agrionidce ( = Agrionin8e Selys). It is not 

 visible in Protomyrmeleon (Lias); in Tarsophlebia, Stenophlebia , 

 I.sophlebia, or Anisophlebia (Jura). It seems to have been well- 

 marked in Steleopteron, while the shape of the wing-outline certainly 

 suggests it in Eui)h(vop.sis, although here A may have remaineil dis- 

 tinct from the hind margin.**^ It seems justifiable to assume that the 

 farther distad petiolation has progressed, the more specialized the 

 insect.

22. The Number of Anal Cross-veins. — Progressive petiolation 

 reduces the area available for anal cross-veins, but not always to the 

 extent one might expect. Thus of American genera discussed in this 

 paper which have the petiolation extending distad to the arculus, 

 Paraphlebia has 2, Philogenia 0, Dimeragrion 1 or 0, Lithagrion 

 anal cross-veins. CalopteryginsE (Selys) have on the whole more 

 anal cross-veins than do the Agrioninse Selj's. If the latter are 

 descendants of some of the former and if Tarsophkbia stands in an 

 ancestral position to the Zygoptera, then we may consider reduc- 

 tion in number of the anal cross-veins as a specialization. Proto- 

 myrmeleon, Tarsophlebia, Isophlebia, and Anisophlcbia each had not 

 less than four anal cross-veins, some of them many more. In 

 Euphwopsis they are not preserved, in Steleopteron they appear to 

 have been present only distad to the level of the outer (distal) end 

 of the quadrilateral. 



B. The characters included under group B on p. 245, anted, are 

 Xos. 7, 8, 10, 12, 156, 176, 19, and 20. In the comparisons made in 

 the early pages of this paper, these characters have been stated in 

 terms of numbers of rows of cells found between the branches of the 

 great veins. They may be stated also by specifying the number of 

 interposed, or supplementary, sectors in each area, and have usually 

 been so stated in the taxonomic literature. It is easy to translate 

 one method of statement into the other, as one row of cells implies 

 no supplementary sector, two rows of cells one supplementary sector, 

 three rows two sectors, etc. The individual variation to which they 

 are suliject increases as the hind margin of the wing is a])proached. 



The Protodonate wing of the Carboniferous and the Permian was 

 richly veined with many supplementary sectors. So also were the 

 Odonate wings of the Lias, excepting Protoniyrmeleon; if Handlirscii's 

 interpretation of its venation be correct,**^ there was but one row of 

 cells between each of the branches of the main veins, except between 

 R« and Ma (two rows increasing to three), Ms and M4 (two rows), 

 M4 and Cui (two rows), and posterior to A (two rows). 



Turning to the Odonata of the Jura,'*" we find richly veined wings 

 in the Anisozygoptera {Tarsophlebia, Slenophlcbia, Isophlebia, 

 Anisophlebia) , and in Euplueopsis; Steleopteron has one row of cells 

 between Mi and Mia, Mm and M2, M2 and R», M^ and JM), and be- 

 tween the veins posterior to Cui, three rows between Us and Ma, two 

 rows between M4 and Cui.

If Handlirscli be correct in his conjecture" that the Protodonata 

 have descended from such genera of the Dictyoneuridse (Palseodic- 

 tyoptera) as Sienodidya, the dense venation of the former evolved 

 from the ecjually dense, but more irregular, network of the latter. 

 The Odonata then carried reduction in the network to a greater 

 degree than in the Protodonata and reduction in the rows of cells 

 of the areas now under discussion would, therefore, be a specializa- 

 tion. We must then recognize that as early as the Lias such reduc- 

 tion was carried in Protomyrmeleon to a greater degree than is showm 

 by many living genera and a similar statement must be made for 

 Steleopteron of the Jura. That any of these reduced venations were 

 capable of giving rise to more exuberantly veined descendants would 

 be denied bj* many phylogenists, but the actual proof of such a 

 denial is not at hand for the Odonata. We have, therefore, onlj' the 

 general tendency to guide us when we assume that reduction in density 

 of venation in the characters of group B means specialization. On 

 the other hand, we must suppose that such richh' veined forms 

 of the present day as Thaumatoneura, Calopteryx, Thore, and Neuro- 

 themis have either preserved the dense venation of, perhaps Mesozoic, 

 ancestors or that thej' have accjuirpd their density liy hypertrophy 

 in the course of generations.^' Here, as elsewhere in this discussion, 

 the possibility of further light from ontogenetic studies is very 

 evident. 



Summarizing the results of this discussion, we conclude that 

 later phylogenetic status is denoted by the following conditions in 

 the characters of the genera compared in this paper: 



1. Retraction of the nodus toward the wing-base. 



2. Reduction in the number of antenodals. 

 (3. Reduction in the number of postnodals.) 



(7. Reduction in the number of rows of cells between Mi and 

 Mu.) 



(8. Reduction in the number of rows of cells between Mm and Ms.) 



9. More distal position of origin of M2. 



(10. Reduction in the number of rows of cells between M2 and R«.) 

 11. More distal position of origin of Rs. 



(12. Reduction in the number of rows of cells between Rs and Ms.) 

 14. More distal position of origin of M3. 



15a. Reduction in number of cross-veins proximal to the subnodus 

 between Ms and M4.

I have endeavored to indicate that the paleontological evidence 

 is not as strong for some of these statements, by enclosing them in 

 parentheses, as for those left unenclosed. There is no ontogenetic 

 evidence as yet. 



These conclusions and the data on which they are basetl merely 

 permit us to determine the probable course, or direction, of change 

 in certain features of the venation. They do not enable us to decide 

 as to the relative order in which the different features changed, 

 whether, for example in the ancestors of living Podagrionine genera. 

 Ma assumed a position at or distad to the subnodus at an earlier, or 

 at a later, period than the reduction of the number of rows of cells 

 in the area posterior to Cu2 occurred, although, given a character, 

 we can saj^ which genera should come first and which should follow- 

 in our phylogenetic list in respect to the modifications of that charac- 

 ter. In the imperfection of our knowlctlge. we are largely guided, 

 therefore, by motives of convenience in selecting the primary charac- 

 ters on which a classification of the memliers of this group is to be 

 based. Having regard to all these considerations, the following 

 scheme for a phylogenetic grouping of the genera of Selys' legion 

 Podagrion is jirescnted.

The preceding S\-nopsis, pp. 256-261, will enable one using this 

 Alternative Grouping to distinguish from each other the genera 

 listed under each final rubric. 



A comparison of Synopsis and Alternative Grouping will show 

 that, in spite of a number of differences in the order in which the 

 genera appear in the two schemes, both begin with and both end 

 with nearly the same forms, which may therefore be regarded as, 

 respectively, the oldest and the youngest members, pliylogenetically, 

 of the legion Podagrion. 



The Relationships of Phenacolestes. 



// the conclusions reached on pp. 2oo-2o6 be correct, 

 Dysagrion of the Eocene of Wyoming, the oldest member of the 

 legion Podagrion now known, cannot have been an ancestor of any 

 of the three known Miocene genera from Colorado, Phenacolestes, 

 Lithagrion , and Melanagrion, hccaui^c it lacked supplementary sectors 

 between M4 and Cui. Melanagrion indeed possesses one more 

 primitive feature than is found in any of the other three of these 

 extinct genera, viz., R. begins proximad to the subnodus. 



Phenacolestes has preserved more primitive characters than has 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 263 



its contemporary Lithagrion, as maj^ be seen bj- a comparison of 

 those numbered 2, (4?), 12, 15b, 17a and b, 19, 20, 21a and b, and 22, 

 on pp. 227 and 232, anted. 



Phenacolesies is more primitive than its contemporary Melanagrion 

 in characters Nos. 1, 2, 12, 156, 17a and b, 19, 20, 216 and 22, but less 

 primitive in characters Nos. 3, (4?), and 11. See pp. 227 and 231, 

 anted. 



Phenacolestes may have been the ancestor of the New World genera 

 Megapodagrion, AUopodagrion, and Perilestes and of the African 

 Chlorolestes, unless it shall be shown that the less oblique pterostigma 

 possessed by all four of these living genera cannot have been acquired 

 from the form which existed in Phenacolestes. Of these four, Mega- 

 podagrion is most like Phenacolestes. But Megapodagrion and the 

 other three genera maj' equally well have descended from Melana- 

 grion, with which thej' agree more closelj' in the shape of the ptero- 

 stigma, although Melanagrion is figured as having no anal cross-veins, 

 a not very weighty objection in this connection. 



Phenacolestes might be considered ancestral to Heteropodagrion 

 and Heteragrion, were it not that these two have, in at least some 

 species, a greater number of postnodals. 



Phenacolestes was apparently not the ancestor of: 



Neuragrion, which has more postnodals, and the cubito-anal cross- 

 vein in a different position, i.e., proximal to the level of the first 

 antenodal ; 



Mesagrion, for the second reason just given for Neuragrion; 



Thaumatoneura, Paraphlebia, or Dimeragrion, which have more 

 than one cubito-anal cross-vein and denser venation in the wing 

 generally (Thaumatoneura), or between Cui and Cu2 (Paraphlebia), 

 or as shown in the greater numbers of postnodals (all three) ; 



Philogenia, which has more postnodals and rather denser venation 

 between Mia and M2; 



Rhipidolestes, which has Ms separating from Mi+2 more jDroximad, 

 Hi l)eginning proximad to subnodus, and more postnodals; 



Podopteryx, which has a denser venation between M3 and IM4 and 

 posterior to Cu2, and more postnodals; 



Argiolestes, which has a denser venation between Ma and Mi. 



Comparisons with genera of the Old World having more reduced 

 venations are useless, as the equally possible descent from other 

 extinct genera than Phenacolesies arises again. 



Whether Megapodagrion and its near ally AUopodagrion are to 

 be looked on as descendants of Phenacolestes or of Melanagrion, 

 18 




264 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



it is of interest to point out that they are not in their present geo- 

 graphical distribution the nearest Podagrionine genera to Colorado, 

 as none of their species are knowTi from a more northern locality 

 than Colombia ("Bogota"). In the intervening territory are foimd 

 Thaumatoneura , Paraphlebia, Philogenia, Hetcragrion, and Perilestes, 

 and of these four genera the most northern known representatives 

 are Paraphlebia zoe and hijalina and Heteragrion chnjsops of the 

 State of Vera Cruz, Mexico.^* 



Professor Cockerell has suggested in correspondence that although 

 the genera allied to Phenacolestes are now Neotropical, they are of 

 northern origin or had northern ancestors. Considering how wide- 

 spread are the living genera of the legion Podagrion, it seems incon- 

 ceivable that their forerunners in the jMiocene did not inhabit many 

 other regions than Colorado. The fact that we know them only 

 from Florissant seems to the writer very negative and insufficient 

 evidence on which to found a conjecture as to the place of origin of 

 this group. 



On the Subfamily Dysagrionin.e Cockerell. 



Preceding his original description of Phenacolestes mirandus, 

 Professor Cockerell proposes a new subfamilj^ of Agrionidse (sensu 

 strictiori), under the name Dj^sagrioninse, which he defines as follows." 



"Antenodals 2 Subfamily Agrioninae. 



Antenodals 4 or more Subfamily DysagrioniniB." 



The number of antenodals is hardly a character of sufficient impor- 

 tance by itself to establish a subfamily, owing to its variability, and at 

 least three genera come between Professor Cockerell's two. divisions. 

 Thus in Thaumaloneum IM'Lachn., the number of antenodals varies 

 from 3 to 5, and Neurolestes Selys of Africa and Neuragrion Karsch 

 of Ecuador have three antenodals.'"*' It is not without bearing on 

 the present topic that all three of these living genera, as well as 

 Phetwcolestes, are of Selys' legion Podagrion, but if any new taxo- 

 nomic arrangement, whetiier of "subfamilies" or of " legions," is to be 

 made, the distinctive characters must be formulated in some other 

 terms than those which Professor Cockerell has employed. The 

 tenability of the subfamily DysagrioniniE has also been discussed

Additional Data on Dimeragrion n. gen. 



In addition to the venational characters which have been given 

 on pp. 238-239, anted, the following are generic features from other 

 parts of the body: 



Second antennal joint one and one-half times as long as the first, 

 the third longer than the first two together. 



Ligula (median labial lobe) bilobed in its distal third, apices 

 tapering but not ver>' acute, separated by an interval whose width 

 is about equal to its depth. 



Tibial spines longer (often 2-3 times longer) than the intervals 

 separating them, 7-8 in the anterior (outer) row, and 8-9 in the pos- 

 terior (inner) row of the third tibia. 



The generic name proposed is in allusion to the fact that there are 

 two supplementarj' sectors only in two areas of the wing, viz., those 

 between Mia and M2 and between Rs and Ms. 



Type, Dimeragrion percubitale n. sp. 

 Dimeragrion percubitale n. sp. PI. XIV, figs. 6-s. 



Adult cf ■ — Vertex, genie, and rear of the head black with some 

 metallic green reflection not very brilliant. A yellowish streak 

 between each antenna and the lateral ocellus of the same side. 

 Traces of pruinosity on the rear of the head. Frons, nasus, and upper 

 half of rhinarium dark metallic violet, well-defined from the black 

 above and the pale yellow below, which latter forms a transverse 

 band on the lower half of the rhinarium and basal half of the labrum, 

 this band having almo.st parallel edges. Distal half of the labrum 

 and the mandibles dark metallic violet. Submentum, mentum, and 

 bases of the maxillae luteous, the distal parts of these two pairs of 

 appendages blackish. Antennie black. 



Prothorax black with a slight metallic green reflection. 



Mesepisterna and mesepimera metallic green, lower part (more 

 than half) of the former and the third fourth (counting from above) 

 of the latter pruinose, or the latter without pruinosity. Metepi- 

 sternum metallic green or metallic violet, a narrow pale (luteous ?) 

 stripe separating this color from that of the mesepimeron, or this pale 

 stripe aksent (still older males). Metepimeron and metasternum 

 pale brown or luteous, some pruinosity on the latter. 



'" These Proceedings, anted, pp. 220-224. 




266 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



Legs blackish, some pruiuosity on coxa?, trochaaters, and femora. 



Wings uucolored, the venation described on p. 238. Stigma dark 

 brown, surmounting 2+ to 4 cells, its proximal side very oblique, 

 so that one or more postnodals are placed between it and the costa, 

 and at least twice as long as the distal side. The relative lengths of 

 the four sides of the stigma, beginning with the longest, are: posterior, 

 proximal, anterior, distal. No brace-vein, i.e., no thickened cross- 

 vein in prolongation caudad of the proximal side. 



Dorsum of abdominal segments •! and 2 dark metallic green, of 

 3-10 black, except that in the middle of 3-5 or 6 the black is replaced 

 by ill-defined dark brown. Sides of 1 and 2, a transverse basal ring 

 on 3, sides inferiorlj- of 3-7, pale bro\Mi or luteous. The dorsal black 

 of 3-6 is continued ventrad at the posterior ends of these segments, 

 forming a transverse apical band on each. A transverse basal 

 yellow ring on 4-7. Intersegmental articulations of 7-10 luteous, 

 otherwise 8-10 are wholly black, 9 being also pruinose on the dorsum. 

 Pruinose traces are also visible on the intersegmental articulation of 

 1-2 and on the sides and stemites of most of the segments. Hind 

 margin of 10 entire. 



Superior appendages longer than 10, a little shorter than 9, black, 

 partly pruinose. Mewed in profile, the axis of each appendage is 

 parallel to that of the abdomen, but the superior margin is strongly 

 declined in the proximal fourth, less so in the remaining three-fourths; 

 the inferior margin in the distal three-fourths of the appendage is 

 produced ventrad into a stronglj' convex lamella which terminates 

 at the blunt apex of the appendage; this lamella reaches its maximum 

 at one-half to two-thirds of the appendage-length. On the dorsal 

 surface of the appendage at the extreme base is a short transverse 

 ridge, which in profile view appears as a tooth. In dorsal view, each 

 superior appendage shows its superior margin as almost straight and 

 decreasing in width throughout the proximal three-fourths, while the 

 distal fourth is strongly curved toward its fellow of the opjwsite side; 

 the ventral lamella is inclined inward and downward (mesad and 

 ventrad), the short transverse basal ridge is at the mesal margin. 



Inferior appendages about seven-eighths as long as the superiors, 

 black. Each one, in profile view, conical, tapering more rapidly on 

 the superior margin beyond two-fifths its length, so that at this point 

 this margin shows an angle; distal third curved strongly upward 

 (dorsad) and terminating in a sleniler ^•ery acute apex. In ventral 

 view, each appendage is applied against its fellow for the proximal 

 three-fifths of its length, beyonil which it is continued along the outer 




1913.] NATITRAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 267 



(ectal) edge as a blunt cj-lindrical process one-half to one-third as 

 wide as the proximal part of the appendage; the abrupt contraction 

 from the proximal part to the distal process is made by a right-angled 

 "shoulder." 



I have not been able to detect any differences either in these 

 appendages or in the genitalia of the second abdominal segment of 

 the males from the four different localities. 



Young cf. — Differs from the adult cf in the absence of pruinosity, 

 in the paler hue of the yellow areas generally, in having pale yellow 

 where the adult has luteous; metallic violet on the head paler, 

 bases of the mandibles and a spot between each one and the adjacent 

 eye yellow, metallic violet or metallic brown instead of metallic green 

 on the thorax, an indistinct narrow yellowish stripe on each side of 

 the mid-dorsal thoracic carina, a bright yellow lifie on the humeral 

 suture, coxae and trochanters pale yellow, pterostigma paler brown 

 with a pale luteous line just within each bounding vein, dorsum of 

 abdominal segments 1 and 2 metallic blue, of 3-7 dark brown, darker 

 at the hind end of each where it is continued ventrad as in the adult, 

 most of the ventral surfaces of 7-10 pale yellow, except at the hind 

 ends of 7 and 8 which are blackish, proximal half of the inferior 

 appendages yellowish ventrally. 



9 . Differs from the adult o^ as follows: Dark color on the nasus, 

 rhinarium and labrum shining black instead of metallic violet. Sides 

 of the first two (confluent with the transverse yellow band below), 

 bases of the mandibles and an oblique band running from each eye 

 upward (dorsad) and inward (mesad) on to the anterior surface of 

 the frons to a variable distance (not correlated with amount of 

 pruinosity on body), bright yellow. A narrow stripe on the humeral 

 suture, a wider stripe on the first lateral suture and on the mete- 

 pisternum bordering the second suture, yellowish. Pruinosity on 

 the thorax in slight quantity on the sterna and metapleuron, or on 

 the sterna only. Coxae and trochanters yellow. Pterostigma as 

 described for the young male, pruinose on the under surface. No 

 pruinosity (or but a trace of it) on the dorsal side of abdominal 

 segment 9, but present in slight traces on the sides inferiorly of 1-8 

 and in somewhat greater amount on the sternites of 1-8. Hind 

 margin of 10 with a narrow mid-dorsal notch about one-fourth as 

 deep as the length of the segment, from which runs a low median 

 carina to the anterior end of the segment; ventral surface of this 

 segment pale brown. Abdominal appendages about twice as long 

 as segment 10, not as long as segment 9, straight, slender, tapeiing 

 to an acut(; apex, black.

Of the two females from Tumatumari, one lacks all pruinosity

Habits. — The Tumatumari female of February 11, the youngest 

 of her sex of the present material bears this label by Mr. E. B. Wil-

 twig." A male from Potoro Landing, the .smallest of his sex in all 

 the present lot has this note by the same collector; "On ends of 

 twigs wings expanded usually in shade." 



Mr. Williamson has kindly furnished the following notes with 

 reference to the habits: "At Wismar back from the river, across 

 the railroad tracks and south of the eminence on which stands the 

 manager's (Mr. Croombie's) house, is a brushy swampy woods, 

 traversed by numerous small streams which head in small ravines 

 with abrupt and rocky ends or pockets. These streams at the 

 season I was there were small and frequently disaj^peared and hence 

 were followed with some difficulty in their upper course. All were 

 short and were intermingled in the lower (cast) end of the woods 

 where the ground was swam]iy and the footing treacherous. The 

 Agrionines were found usually near the upjjcr ends of the streams 

 below the rocky pockets. 



"At Roekstone the railroad track was followed back toward Wismar 

 where two or three streams, small at this season, cross tlie track at 

 interv'als, flowing in a northerly direction. These streams were 




1913.1

followed in the direction of their flow till each was lost in the woods 

 and it was impossible to trace its course further. 



"The habits of the Agrionines at both locations (Wismar and 

 Rockstone) were identical. They rested on the extreme tips of dead 

 twigs, usually two or three feet from the ground, with outspread 

 wings and rigidly horizontal bodies. The color and the position 

 assumed gave the impression of alertness and self-reliance. The 

 flight was swift, and because of light-conditions also, was difficult 

 to follow. At rest they were fairly conspicuous. When one flew at 

 mj' approach I stood still and began examining the possible destina- 

 tions in the direction of its flight, and thus located it." 



Variatiotjs. — The smallest males are from Potoro Landing, followed 

 in order by those from Tumatumari, Wismar and Rockstone. The 

 order of the females by size from the smallest is not the same, owing 

 perhaps to there being but a single specimen of this sex from 

 Rockstone, viz.: Tumatumari, Rockstone, AA'ismar. 



The most remarkable variation in this species is in the number 

 of cubito-anal cross-veins, which varies from 1 to 4 on the front wings 

 and from 1 to 5 on the hind. Of the twentj' specimens studied only 

 three (all males) have the same number on all four wings, and of 

 these three two have 2 cubito-anal cross-veins and the third three. 

 Two other specimens (females) agree with each other in the number 

 and arrangement of these veins on their four wings, leaving fifteen 

 out of the twenty no two of which are exactly alike in this feature when 

 all four wings are considered. The remarkable nature of this varia- 

 tion will be appreciated when it is recalled that in the great majority 

 of the .\grioniniE of de Selys there is but a single cubito-anal cross- 

 vein on each wing. The conditions found in the present material are 

 summarized in the following

(The numbers in parentheses are those of the wings in which the most prox- 

 imal of these cross-veins is situated proximad to the level of the first antenodal.) 




270 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [MSLJ, 



It is rather curious, although at present insignificant, that the 

 abnormahty of having a cubito-anal cross-vein situated proximad 

 to the level of the first antenodal should be more frequent on the 

 left side in both the front and the hind wmgs. 



The specific name proposed, percubitale, is in allusion to the 

 unusual numbers of cubito-anal cross-veins.

A CONTHIBUTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORTHOPTERA OF 

 ARGENTINA, 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN. 



The present paper is based entirely on collections made by Mr. 

 P. Jorgensen, of Buenos Aires. These collections were sent either 

 direct to us for study or through Mr. Esben Petersen, of Silkeborg, 

 Denmark, to whose interest we are obligated for much of the material 

 treated in the paper. In addition to thanking these gentlemen for 

 the opportunity to study the present collections, we also wish, on 

 behalf of the Academy, to thank Mr. Jorgensen forthe very important 

 additions received from the collection, by far the greater portion of 

 which, including all the types and unique specimens, remain in the 

 Academy series. 



The entire series, collected over the greater portion of northern 

 and north-central Argentina, comprises ten hundred and twenty 

 .specimens, representing one hmidred and sixty-two species, of which 

 three genera and twenty species are new to science. 



The general regions represented in the collections are: 



First. Territorj' of the Misiones. The extreme northeastern 

 extension of Argentina extending between the Parand and Uruguay 

 Rivers, which respectively separate it from Paraguay and Brazil. 

 In consecjuence of its position it has afar greater proportion of tropical 

 types than any other portion or portions of Argentina. 



Second. Province of Corrientes. Southwest of the Misiones and 

 between the same rivers, but of a less tropical character. 



Third. Province of Jujuy. The extreme northwestern province, 

 forming part of the Bolivian boundary. This is a region charac- 

 terized by a number of types of Orthoptera peculiar to it or shared 

 with Bolivia or the province of Salta to the south and east. 



Fourth. Province of Salta. This province is next south of Jujuy, 

 which it also bounds on the east, the latter portion forming part of 

 the Chaco region. 



Fifth. Province of Tucuman, South of Salta and at the ea.st base 

 of the Andean uplift, part of which is within the province. 



Sixth. Provinces of San Juan and Meudoza. These are in the 

 west-central part of the country, forming a considerable i)art of the 

 Chilean frontier and including conditions from the plains to the 




274 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May^ 



summits of the Andes. Mr. Jorgensen has kiiicllj- furnished us with 

 the following information on these two provinces, which he has 

 examined with considerable care. "Provincia de Mendoza is 

 unusually dry and exceedingly hot (extreme heat 42° C). Rain 

 falls as a rule in local showers, although occasionally there are heavy 

 rainfalls with terrific thunderstorms. As a rule, the sky is cloudless, 

 and the temperature, even in summer, often falls to a considerable 

 degree at night. In the district around the town of Mendoza it 

 freezes not rarely at night during the 'winter' months (Maj' -Septem- 

 ber), although even at this elevation to see a layer of snow in the 

 morning is rare, and in any event, even in the coldest months, snow 

 never has the opportunity of laying, for it can be quite hot towards 

 midday. Only high up and in the front range of the Cordillera de 

 Mendoza the snow lays for long periods in the very coldest months. 

 In the lowlands, or rather the flat lower lying districts, east of the 

 Cordilleras, the ground is composed of alluvial strata of an ash-gray, 

 finely powdered clay soil, which bears a rich bush vegetation, the 

 gray color of which, together with its adaptation to the climate, points 

 to an ancient desert vegetation. A large proportion of the plants,, 

 quite apart from the cacti, are thorny and spiky, the Spanish name 

 'Espinales' thus suiting the district admirably. The grass fruits 

 are often prickh' and also in a single instance mechanical flycatchers. 

 Many of the plants here are very aromatic or contain quantities of 

 resin. At the transition point between the lowlands and the Cor- 

 dilleras, the ground is more or less rising, here and there swamps are 

 to be found, often .strongly impregnated with saltpeter, and nearly 

 everywhere are to be found stones (rolling stones), or even pieces of 

 rock, mixed with the earth. The front ranges of the Cordilleras,, 

 which rise to the west of the city of Mendoza, are partly solid rock 

 and partly products of disintegration. These are covered with the 

 very same plants as the lowland {Covillea divaricata, GourfKra decor- 

 ticans, Prosopis campestris and alpataco, Acacia furcata, Senecio 

 mendocinus, Sitceda divaricata, etc.). Localities: IMendoza (767 

 meters above the sea), Chacras de Coria (936 meters), nine kilometers 

 more southerly, i)oth at the foot of the first range, Precordillera de 

 Mendoza; Punta del Agua and Blanco Encalada (1,068 meters) in 

 the mountains and railroad stations on the PVrro Carril Transandina ; 

 Potrerillos (1,368 meters) antl San Ignacio (1,325 meters), railroad 

 .stations in a large valley in the .second range, Cerro Negro, on the 

 Rio Mendoza; Pedregal (696 meters), seventeen kilometers east of 

 Mendoza, swamps; La Paz (.504 meters), forty-eight kilometers 




191S.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHIL.U)ELPHIA. 275 



southeast of ^lendoza on the Rio Tunuyan. The Provmcia de San 

 Juan is similar to !Mendoza, but hotter and drier." 



Seventh. Province of San Luis. East of ^Mendoza and, according 

 to Mr. Jorgensen, of the same nature and condition as around 

 Mendoza. 



Eighth. Province of Cordoba. East of San Luis and forming a 

 .considerable part of the great "Pampa." 



Ninth. 'N'icinitj^ of Buenos Aires. The immediate vicinity of the 

 'Capital, a historic zoological locality, is represented by quite a number 

 of specimens. 



The total number of species represented aside from the new forms 

 is one hundred and forty-two, of which fiftj'-sLx are here recorded 

 from Argentina for the first time. Of these fiftj'-sLv, forty-nine are 

 recorded only from the ^lisiones. Of the total of one hundred and 

 sixty-two species, one hundred and sixteen ar(i recorded from the 

 Misiomes. These figures give some idea of the richness of the Misiones 

 territorj- in Orthoptera. 



A tabulation of the distribution of the entire list of species shows, 

 .among other things, the following interesting features: 



One hundred and sixteen species recorded from the Misiones. 



Twenty species recorded from the ^lisiones and west of, but not 

 -south of, the same. 



Forty-seven species recorded from Brazil, Paraguay and the 

 ]\Iisiones alone in Argentina. 



Thirty-two species recorded from the Misiones and the Pampan 

 region, also northward, but not westward. 



Seventeen species recorded from Buenos Aires westward to 

 Mendoza. (Tj^pical pampan and plains forms.) 



One species recorded only from Jujuy and the Pampas. 



Three species recorded only from the Chaco, Jujuj-, and Tucuman. 



The distribution of all of the species treated has been given in the 

 paper, and, aside from the new ones, the forms here recorded from 

 Argentina for the first time bear an asterisk before their names.

We have followed Shelford in using limbata for the species usually

 this reference. The present specimen has but four tarsal joints in 

 the right caudal tarsus and another male from Puerto Bertoni, 

 Paraguay, has the same true of the left caudal tarsus. 



This species has been recorded by the author from Puerto Bertoni, 

 Paraguay, but it is here reported from Argentina for the first time.

The type of this species is unique. It is quite singular that the 

 present species shows no close relationship to any of the previously 

 known American forms of this peculiar genus, while its close affinity 

 to the Oriental rugosa is immediately apparent when the two are 

 examined. 



We take pleasure in dedicating this interesting species to the 

 collector, ^Ir. P. Jorgensen, to whom we are indebted for the oppor- 

 tunity to study the very remarkable collection of Argentine Orthop- 

 tera treated in the present paper.

Tj-pe: cf^ ; Misiones, Argentina. February 8, 1910. (P. Jor- 

 gensen; No. 1.) [Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., type No. 5,211.] 



This new form is a very interesting species apparently allied to 

 E. testacea Brunner, from Brazil, and caizana Giglio-Tos, from Bolivia, 

 differing from the former in the color pattern of the head and 

 pronotum and in the covered portion of the tegmen being no darker 

 than the general color, and from caizana in the greater size, in the 

 more rotundate median protuberance of the caudal margin of the 

 pronotum, the non-punctate margins of the same, in the blackish 

 humeral trunk of the tegmina and the non-punctate limbs. 



Size medium. Head very slightly projecting beyond the pronotum, 

 considerably depressed; interocular space nearly one and one-half 

 times the depth of the eye, the outline hardly rounded when seen 

 from the dorsum, the ej'es well rounded; paired ocelli enormous in 

 size, elliptical in outline, converging ventrad, slightly impressed; 

 antenna slightly longer than half of the body length. Pronotum 

 of the form found in most species of the genus, cephalic margin 

 regularly arcuate from the lateral angles except for a slight flattening 

 dorsad of the head, lateral angles very narrowly rounded obtuse- 

 angulate, lateral margins moderately convergent caudad, caudal 

 margin appreciably produced mesad into a broad rounded expansion, 

 laterad of which the margins are arcuato-emarginate; disk with two 

 pairs of impressed punctures slightly cephalati of the middle, the usual 

 transverse creasing of the surface towartl the caudal margin distinct 

 but not deep. Tegmina surpassing the apex of the abdomen by 

 about half the pronotal length, moderately broad, the median half 

 subequal in width ; costal margin moderately arcuate in the proximal 



« £t(; ^ari;-(^)/)of, bearing brandmarks.

 moderately arcuate distad, apex 

 rotundato-rectangulate; region of the costal veins coriaceous, sub- 

 opaque; anterior ulnar vein with three complete and eight incom- 

 plete rami; anterior field of the wing very broad. Abdomen strongly 

 depressed; supra-anal plate broad, produced, rounded, with a median 

 rectangulate emargination; cerci subfusiform, the distal extremity 

 attenuate; subgenital plate broad, rounded, slightly asymmetrical, 

 slightly impressed at the insertion of the styles, the latter very small. 

 Cephalic femora with the ventro-cephalic margin armed with four 

 or five spines mesad and a single distal one, the area between supj^lied 

 with very short setiform spinulations. Median and caudal limbs 

 with the ventro-cephalic margins of the femora supplied with five 

 spaced spines. Caudal metatarsi very slightly longer than the re- 

 mainder of the tarsus, biseriato-spinulose ventrad, pulvillus small, 

 distad. 



General color cream-buff, the tegmina, aside from the costal por- 

 tion, nearly uncolored translucent, maculations vandyke brown and 

 where less decided russet. Head with the occiput having a large 

 maculation of vandyke brown divided cephalo-caudad by a line of 

 the base color; region from the middle of the interocular space to the 

 middle of the interocellar space russet with a decided vandyke brown 

 section tlorsad; eyes seal Ijrown; antennse, except for the pale proxi- 

 mal joint, bistre. Pronotum thickly speckled with fine vandyke 

 brown points with less frequent rather regularly placed larger dots 

 of the same color, a median sublyrate i)attern, part of which is made 

 up of a transverse series of eight large dots, of the same color; caudal 

 margin with a series of well-s]iaced points. Tegmina with a short 

 sinuous lino on the base of the humeral trunk seal brown, the well-

 blotches, russet. Wings hyaline with the veins of the anterior field 

 very pale russet and of the posterior field vandyke brown, the 

 coriaceous portion of the costal margin buffy. Limbs and ventral 

 surface pale clay color, the latter finely speckled with vandyke 

 brown and with larger paired lateral patches of the same color, the 

 former darkening in color distad, the spines tawny.

In addition to the type, we have examined sbc paratj-pes (taken 

 January 1, February 8, October 1, and December, 1910) which differ 

 little from the tj-pe. The size shows almost no variation, while color 

 differences are wholly in the degree of density of the fine brownish 

 punctations on the tegmina. In this respect the type represents one 

 pale extreme, from which the series grades to the other extreme, 

 represented by one specimen, in which these small spots are much 

 more abundant and generally distributed on the tegmina, being well 

 marked on the costal field. The larger maculations of the tegmina 

 of the type are represented in the darker individuals by smaller, 

 Vandyke brown, more sharply cut ones, while the lining of the humeral 

 trunk is broader, solid, and decidedly striking.

This specimen is very interesting as, while it fully agrees with the 

 descriptions of the female of this species in every other respect, 

 according exactly in the form of the tegminal margins, it differs in the 

 tegmina being distinctly longer than in the more usual type described. 

 The tegmina in our specimen cover nearly half of the abdomen and 

 are nineteen- millimeters in length from the point of attachment to 

 the extreme portion of the margin. The previous descriptions give 

 the length of the tegmina as from ten to twelve millimeters. 



All of the older records of the species are simply from "Brazil." 

 The present author has recorded a male from Yaguarasapa, Paraguay, 

 while Giglio-Tos' has recorded what is in all probability this or a 

 congeneric species from Paraguay as Blabera fuinigata, a peculiarly 

 Cuban species, the female of which reseml)les this genus.

 from adspersicoUis and fusceUa StAl, both from Rio Janeiro, in the 

 smaller size, non-lineate pronotum, and very much more uniform 

 coloration. 



Size small; form moderately depressed; body, except pronotum 

 and tegmina, covered with fine ochraceous pile. Head but very 

 slightly projecting beyond the pronotum, outline of the occiput 

 subtruncate; interspace between the eyes broad, about equal to one 

 and one-half times the greatest depth of the eye, this region and the 

 equally broad interantennal section impresso- 

 punctulate; eyes elongate pyro-reniform in 

 outline; antennae subequal to the body 

 in length. Pronotum transverse elliptical in

 lateral portions moderately declivent; surface ofl^"' Tn o?"tvpT 

 polished. Tegmina surpassing the apex of the ( x 4.) 

 abdomen by more than the length of the 



pronotum, very slightly inferior to the tips of the wings, sublanceolate 

 in outline ; costal margin gently arcuate, sutural margin straight in the 

 proximal two-thirds and thence arcuate to the rather broadly rounded 

 apex; venation of the peculiar type found in this genus, the trans- 

 verse veins forming regularly subquadrate or subrectangulate areas, 

 the surface of these areas as well as the costal field minutely papillose; 

 costal veins .seven in number; anal vein joining the sutural margin 

 at about a third of the length from the base. Supra-anal plate with 

 the distal margin arcuate; subgenital plate asymmetrical; cerci

The Gtnus COPTOPTEEYX. 



In studying the material in the present collection belonging to the 

 genus Coptopteryx, we have found it necessary to make a preliminary 

 revision of the genus, examining all the available material belonging 

 to the same. From the present series, the Academy Collection and 

 the Heliard Collection we have assembled fifty specimens, and from a 

 careful study of this series it is evident that considerable confusion 

 has existed in all previous work on the genus, including that by the 

 present author. A large portion of this confusion is directly traceable 

 to Saussure's error in using Blanchard's name crenaticolUs for a 

 species distinct from that author's gayi, when, as shown by the 

 present material, they are clearlj^ sexes of the same species. 



It is evident from our material that almost all ^of the species* of 

 the genus show very considerable size variation, that venational 

 characters are very unreliable, and also that green phases with hyaline 

 tegmina and wings in the male, and brown phases with infumate or 

 infuscate tegmina and wings in the same sex probably will be found 

 in the same species, although we have little conclusive evidence 

 regarding the color phases. 



The following key has been constructed from the material before 

 us and we trust it will be found serviceable. 



Males. 



a. — Size medium to large. Shaft of pronotum not strongly con- 

 stricted mcsad. Width of head contained at least two and 

 one-half times in the length of pronotum. 

 b. — Size large" (body .56.5-79 mm.; pronotum 15-21.2). 



c. — Greatest width of the pronotum contained not more than 

 three and one-half times in the length of the same, 

 d. — Wing narrower, the breadth contained more than 



twice in the length argentina (Burmeister). 



dd. — Wing broader, the breadth contained less than twice 



in the length claraziann Saussure. 



cc. — Greatest width of the pronotum contained at least four 



times in the length of the same Ihoracica n. sp.

Cortlillera de Mendoza. March 22, 1908. One male. 



Of this species we have before us a series of eleven males and 

 fifteen females, from the evidence of which we know there is a great 

 amount of individual variation in size. The two males from Sapucay 

 previously recorded by us as cromticoUis (I'ide infra) are considerably 

 smaller than any other specimens of that sex, although the largest 

 male individual is from the same locality. The females of the 

 Sapucay series show very similar, but somewhat less decided size 

 variation, while those from the Province of Mendoza average con- 

 siderably smaller, yet show much variation among themselves. 



Measurements of the extreme individuals arc as follows: 



•To this species belongs the male material from Sapucay, Paraguay, recorded 

 by us as crenalicolUa (Pror. Acad. Xat. Sci. I'hila., 1907, p. 1.5.5).

The two small males from Sapucay and the Cordillera de Mendoza 

 male differ from all the others of that sex in having the extreme 

 proximal portion of the marginal field of the tegmina equally hyaline 

 with the remainder of that field, while the other specimens have the 

 same opaque rufous, on one side touching the humeral trunk and on 

 the other obliquely delimited. 



The Cordillera de Mendoza specimen differs from all the other 

 specimens seen in having the margins of the collar of the pronotum 

 more decidedly converging cephalad, the cephalic extremity being 

 much narrower than usual in consequence. This appears, however, 

 to be purely individual. 



The species, from the basis of previous records and present material, 

 is known to range from southern Brazil (Saussure) and central 

 Paraguay (Sapucay) south to Uruguay (Saussure) and west to the 

 Cordillera de Mendoza, Argentina.

 narrow. Supra-anal plate broadly trigonal, of similar form to that 

 of the female; subgenital plate broad, the distal extremity of the 

 margin with a slight obtuse-angulate emargination. Limbs similar 

 to those of the female, but slenderer. 



General color prout's brown, becoming isabelline on the cephalic 

 limbs and greenish on the caudal ones. Tegmina strongly washed 

 with liver brown, costal field with the veins buffy aside from the 

 subcoriaceous portion adjacent to the humeral trunk, which is of the 

 general tegminal color. Wings infuscate with bistre, the cross veins- 

 white, greater portion of the costal margin and a small area at the 

 base of the wing claret lirown.

In addition to the type and allotype, we have before us two male 

 and three female paratypes. The specimen referred to by us {vide 

 supra) from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, received from Saussure and 

 determined by him as gayi, is clearly referable to this species. In 

 size the Sapucaj' specimens show but little variation for this genus, 

 while the color varies appreciably in intensity in the females and in 

 the males to the extent noted in the paper quoted above.

A careful study of Blanchard's original descriptions of the above 

 .species leaves no room for doubt but that the two names were based 

 on opposite sexes of the same species, gayi on the male and crenati- 

 collis on the female. 



The present material agrees very fully with these descriptions and 

 also shows that the species varies very considerably in size, the 

 Mendoza male being very much smaller than the others of that sex. 



The original measurements and those of the present series are as 

 follows :

The males before us agree with the original figure, although the 

 tegmina and wings are very slightly less fuliginous. The small 

 Mendoza male has the limbs colored exactly as in the original figure, 

 while the other males have them more brownish, particularly the 

 cephalic ones. The females are all of tones of brownish varying 

 toward hoary gray brown and seal brown. 



The species is known to range from Chile (specifically Santiago, 

 vide Philippi) east to Buenos Aires (Saussure), south to Bahia Blanca

The second description given by Saussure^- shows some pomts of 

 difference from our material, and it is quite probable that he had 

 another (Brazilian) species before him. Our specimens have no 

 trace of a covering or overcapping projection of the front extending 

 over the inferior ocellus, as described by Saussure, in fact there is no 

 approach to a development of this sort of structure, which is so 

 marked in Pseudomiopteryx and toward which Saussure considered 

 rustica, as understood by him, to tend. The cephalic coxifi are very 

 finely serrulate instead of unarmed as stated to be by Saussure. 



One of our specimens is more decidedly iniuscate than the others, 

 being as dark as specimens of Pseudomiopteryx infuscata, but this is 

 apparently, individual.

This species in general size is much the same as P. livida, but the 

 form of the pronotum is very slender, more as in the other species 

 of the genus, from all of which it differs markedly in the brevity of 

 the same portion.

 large, placed in a triangle; facial shield similar to that of the male, 

 hut more decidedly transverse ; antennae slightly longer than the head 

 and pronotum together. Pronotum differing from the female in such 

 respects as found in other species of the genus, the greatest width of 

 the supracoxal expansion contained five times in the length, the

Redtenbacher considered marginaJe a close ally to the congeneric 

 fasciatum, from which it was separated by the lineate feinora. 

 Gray's Phasnia hopii was unknowTi to him and accordingly placed 

 doubtfully under the genus Stratodes. The original description of 

 fasciatum gives us no clue to the color of the femora. The presence 

 or absence of the lateral thoracic line of yellowish, the slightly 

 armulate antennae and the differences in the tegminal protuberance 

 used by us to separate the Sapucay material into hopii and fasciatus 

 have been shown by Redtenbacher to be individual in cliaracter.

 p. 163, fig.s. 5, 6. [Sapucay, Paraguay.] 



Misiones. January 29, 1911; March 13, 1909; December 14, 

 1910. (Nos. 1, 2 and 8.) Two adult females, one immature male, 

 one immature female. 



The immature male shows conclusively that this genus is not the 

 opposite (female) sex of Paraleptijnia Caudell, which was suggested as 

 a possibility in the original description of Steleoxiphus. The character 

 of the antennae, form of the head and proportions show the two to 

 be generically distinct, and in these respects the two sexes are very 

 similar. The immature male and female, both taken on December 

 14th, are similar in size, being somewhat more than half the length 

 of the adults. 



The anal segment of the male is compressed, carinate dorsad, more 

 strongly so distad, the distal margin obtuse-angulate eniarginate; 

 supra-anal plate very minute, trigonal; cerci more than half the 

 length of the anal .segment, crassate, subeylindrical, apex subacute; 

 suhgenital plate hardly reaching the apex of the anal segment, apex 

 narrowly rotundato-subtuberculate. The immature female has the 

 subgenital operculum but slightly shorter proportionately than it is 

 in the adult. 



XIPHOPHASMA" n. gea. 



A member of the Clitumninse and related to Steleoxiphus Rehn and 

 Paraleptijnia and Ceratiscus Caudell. From Steleoxiphus it can 

 readily be separated by the bispinose and broatler head, the more 

 abbreviate metatarsi and the depressed and abbreviate antennae; 



" From iiipoc, sword, and Phasma. 




302 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [MaV, 



from ParalepU/nia and Ceratiscus the new genus differs in the spinose 

 head, also from the former in the more abbreviate antennae and from 

 the latter in the narrower head, more abbreviate metatarsi and 

 non-lobate limbs. 



Head bispinose; greatest width of the head less than the length of 

 the same; antennae short, composed of fifteen joints, the proximal 

 longer than broad, the next subquadrate, the third subequal to the 

 first in length, the fourth transverse, the remainder longitudinal and 

 tapering, the fifth and sixth less longitudinal than the succeeding ones, 

 all depressed. ^Median segment longitudinal, subequal to the head 

 in length. Cerci of female terete; subgenital plate of female greatly 

 elongate, lanceolate, compressed. Limbs non-lobate ; tarsi abbreviate, 

 in no case a fourth the tibial length; metatarsi of the cephalic limbs 

 slightly more than half the length of the tarsi, of the other limbs a 

 half or less than a half the length of the same.

Type: 9 ; Misiones, Argentina. February 1, 1911. (P. Jor-

Belonging to the section of the genus including chichi nieca Saussure^ 

 tecta Morse, annulipes Bruner and scudderi Bolivar. From chichimeca 

 and scudderi the present form can be readily distinguished by the 

 tectate dorsum, scudderi also having the femora narrower; from 

 annulipes the new form can be separated by the non-glabrous surface 

 and the blunter and much less produced vertex, no approach being 

 found to the type of T. prorsn, the vertex of which that of unnulipes 

 is said to greatly resemble. From tecta, its closest ally, paratecta 

 can be separated by the more elevated and arcuate median carina 

 of the pronotum, the more regularly angulate cephalic margin of the 

 same, the less decidedly lineato-rugulose dorsum of the pronotum, the 

 less projecting vertex, the less thickened margins of the frontal co!<ta, 

 the more lanceolate tegmina anil more finely sculptured jjugina of the 

 caudal femora. 



Size medium (for the genus); form robust: surface rather evenly 

 chagrinous. Head with the greatest width contained about one and 

 one-third times in the depth of the same; fa,stigium with the carina 

 regularly arcuate when seen from above, obsolete immediately 

 laterad of the median carina, width of the fastigium subequal to that 

 of one of the eyes; median carina of the fastigium jjrominent, ])ro- 

 jecting moderately cephalatl of the lateral carina of the fastigium, 

 when viewed from the side strongly arcuate and jiassing into the

facial outline, which is arcuate with a slight sinuosit j- at the ocellus ; 

 facial forks moderately separated, hardly diverging ventrad; eyes 

 considerably shorter than the depth of the infra-ocular portion of the 

 genae, trigono-reniform in basal outline, moderately prominent when 

 seen from the dorsum. Pronotum tectate in section, the median 

 carma well elevated, in longitudinal section regularly arcuate with the 

 very faintest interhumeral flattening; cephalic margin of the pro- 

 notmn almost rectangulate, the immediate angle very fine, reaching 

 to the base of the fastigial carina of the vertex; humeral angles not 

 at all prominent, rounded very broad obtuse-angulate; apex reaching

to the base of the genicular arches of the caudal femora, in general 

 form acute, the immediate apex blunted, slightly subulate; surface 

 of the dorsum with a number of very weak longitudinal lines, these 

 most numerous in the humeral region and all slightly latero-caudad 

 in general trend; lateral lobes with the greatest dorsal length slightly 

 greater than the greatest depth, with several glabrous areas dorsad, 

 caudal margin oblique-truncate, ventro-caudal angle acute, humeral

We have before us individuals from Caiza, Bolivian Chaco, Salta

 Misiones specimens have been compared. 



The species is now known to range from Brazil (specifically 

 Corumbd [Bruner]) and the Bolivian Chaco (Caiza and San Francisco 

 [Giglio-Tos]), south to Tucuman [Bruner] and across Paraguay to the 

 ]\Iisiones territory.

The above-listed specimens have been compared with a pair of 

 cotypes in the collection of the Academy, received from Dr. Borelli> 

 taken at Caiza and San Lorenzo, and found to be inseparable. One 

 Jujuy female undoubtedly had an injurj' to the rostrum which 

 retarded the development of the characteristic clavate expansion of 

 the same, although the almost ecjually characteristic cruciform sec- 

 tion of that portion is decided. 



The original localities and those given above are all we know for 

 the species.

 (Nos. 3, 4 and 5.) Three adult males, ten adult females, one imma- 

 ture female. 



These specimens average slightly larger than individuals from 

 Cordoba and Carcarana, Argentina, but smaller than Sapucay, 

 Paraguay, representatives. The number of spines on the dorso-lateral 

 margin of the caudal tibiae is very unreliable as a diagnostic character,, 

 as an examination of the present series, which unquestionably repre- 

 sents but a single species, shows the number to range from eight to 

 twenty, while in a single specimen the disparity in the number of 

 spines on these margins of the two tibiae is as much as four (eight and 

 twelve). 



This species is found over a considerable area, having been recorded 

 from as far north as Matto Grosso, Brazil (Bruner), and Aguiarenda, 

 Bolivian Chaco (Giglio-Tos), south to the Rio Colorado (Brimer), 

 east to Montevideo, Uruguay (Brunner), west to Tucuman, Argen- 

 tina (Giglio-Tos).

 closely placed, traces of the same present in the female. Supra-anal 

 plate short, lanceolate, apex acute; cerci extremely short, simple; 

 subgenital plate elongate-lanceolate, subequal in length to that 

 portion of the pronotum caudad of the insertion of the limbs, strongly

This veiy extensive series is of considerable interest, demonstrating 

 as it does that the species is midoubtedly common within its range 

 and that considerable variation in size and sculpture occurs. 



The size extremes of the series are: length of body, cf 36.7-4.5.5 

 mm., 9 63.5-82.5; length of head, d" 5.3-6.7, 9 8.5-10; length of 

 rostrum, cf 1.2-1.5, 9 2..5-3.8; length of pronotum, c?' 7.2-9.8, 

 9 11.2-13.8; length of tegmen, 9 2.5-2.7; length of cephalic femur, 

 cf 7.1-9, 9 9.3-12.6; length of caudal femur, d^ 14.8-18, 9 20.8- 

 ■27.5. Both extremes of the male sex are from Mendoza, the minimum 

 of the female sex from Blanco Encalada and the maximum from 

 Chacras de Coria. 



The wings of the female vary in the shape of the" exposed coriaceous 

 portion, this ranging from broad ovate to elongate elliptical, the size 

 variation of the same being considerable and in no way correlated 

 with the general size. The rostrum exhibits a very appreciable 

 amount of variation in the female, ranging from a length hardly 

 greater than that of the eye to one and one-half times the length of 

 the same. The spiniform tubercles on the cephalic and caudal 

 margins of the pronotum and the spiniform lobes of the mesonotum 

 vary considerably in prominence, the latter also in the degree of their 

 erection, being vertical in .some and decidedly inclined caudad in 

 other individuals. The linear rugosities of the body show some 

 variation in prominence which does not appear to be correlated with 

 the development of the tubercles and lobes. 



The only e\idence of geographic variation seen in the series is that 

 noticed in the slenderer pronotum of the male and immature female 

 from Alto Pencosa, a locality somewhat removed from those at which 

 the other specimens were taken. 



The color varies from dull brown through gray-browns to hoary 

 white, but how much of the brownish coloration is due to discolora- 

 tion cannot be determined. Some individuals are partially blackish, 

 but this is unquestionably due to discoloration, as the specimens were 

 not eviscerated. 



The following diagnosis shows the features in which the previously 

 undescribed male differs from the female. 



Size small ; form more elongate than in the other sex ; surface much 

 smoother than in the female. Head with its dorsal length two-thirds 

 that of the pronotum, considerably constricted caudad of the eyes, 

 the whole head considerably elevated cephalo-dorsad; fastigium

horizontal, much shorter than in tlie female, hardly more than half 

 the length of the eye, apex very blunt; eyes very prominent, ovate 

 in outline, their length more than half that of the proximal portion 

 of the dorsum of the head; antennae slightly longer than the eye,, 

 five-jointed. Pronotum subcylindrical, subequal in width except 

 for the expansion at the cephalic margin and the insertion of the 

 cephalic limbs, the former margin truncate mesad with a pair of low 

 flanking tubercles and obliciuely truncate laterad; width at the 

 insertion of the cephalic limbs contained two and one-half times in 

 the length of the pronotum, caudal margin non-tuberculate; surface 

 of the dorsum without the prominent ridges found in the female. 

 No tegmina or wings present. Caudal margin of the mesonotum 

 non-tuberculate. Abdomen with the medio-longitudinal carina 

 indicated only caudad; supra-anal plate sublanceolate, apex well 

 rounded, a prominent medio-longitudinal sulcus present on the 

 proximal two-thirds; cerci simple, styliform, short, blunt; subgenital 

 plate moderately rostrate, subacute, carinate ventrad, dorsal face 

 of the apex flattened, sulcate, the apical margin slightly cleft. Limbs 

 slightly more robust than in the female; caudal femora slightly more 

 buUate, the tips of the femora reaching to the distal margin of the 

 sixth abdominal segment.

The only information with the specimens on the habits of the 

 species is on several Mendoza individuals labelled "On Lcirrea." This 

 is apparently Covillea (Larrea of authors) divaricala, a shrub which Mr. 

 Jorgensen tells us constitutes an important part of the vegetation of 

 the Mendoza region. It is probable that the insect spends a con- 

 siderable part of its life on the twigs of the bush, which it sinuilates 

 very well and where it would l)e well protected. This proclivity is 

 found in certain species of Orthoptera occurring on the allied ('. 

 Iridcninta of the Lower Sonoran deserts of North America. 



Nine of the pairs in the .series were taken "in coiiula." The 

 earliest seasonal date that is represented by adults is November 15,

Alto Pencosa, Prov. of San Luis. Elev. 660 meters. December 

 22, 1908. One nearly adult female. 



The present specimens are referred to this species with some 

 uncertaintj', as certain points of difference from the origmal descrip- 

 tion are evident, although how much weight to allow these differences 

 is a matter of question, as series of the allied A: chloropterum and 

 compactum show considerable variation in size and sculpture. 



Brumier knew only the female of the species, and his tj^pe specimen 

 was considerably smaller than either of the adult females before us, 

 although larger than the immature one. This size difference is, 

 however, about equalled in our series of compactum. 



Brunner used the serrulate or smooth condition of the margins of 

 the ovipositor jaws as one of the major division characters for the 

 species of the genus, placing chloropterum and compactum in the 

 .serrulate section and granulosum and foliatum in the other. As a 

 matter of fact, chloropterum is verj' similar to foliatum in having very 

 weak serrulations on the margins of the dorsal valves, while com- 

 pactum has the serrulations very decided. Aside from size, the 

 description oi foliatum, based on the female sex, agrees with that sex 

 of the present series in all the characters except the number of spines 

 on the margins of the caudal tibiie and in the character of the caudal 

 margin of the pronotum. The number of spines is unimportant, as a 

 count shows they run from nine to twelve on the external margin 

 (Brunner gives thirteen) and from nine to eleven on the internal 

 (Brunner gives eleven). One specimen has nine on each of the 

 margins and another has a difference of two spines on the same 

 margins of the two tibiie. The pronotum is described as "margine 

 antico et postico in lobos binos foliatos, obtusos productis," and in 

 the present material these margins are strongly bispinose, but hardly 

 developed in foliate lobes. 



"Given in error as "Fig. 12B" in the text, but the explanation to the plates 

 shows that "B" refers to compactum and "C ' to foliatum.

 present as in the other sex; the general form of the pronotum more 

 subequal in width and not gradually enlarging caudad as in the 

 female. No trace of tegmina and wings. Narrowest portions of 

 the mesonotum and metanotum subequal in width to the pronotum; 

 mesonotum with no spines on the margin. Abdomen not multi- 

 carinate, a single median carina intlicated; supra-anal plate lanceo- 

 late, the apex not rounded, surface slightly excavate, not sulcate; 

 cerci simple, tapering, very short, blunt; subgenital plate greatly

ters is present in the species, while it also passes into the following 

 form which is merely a geographic race. 



The size varies considerably, even in series from the same locality, 

 while the coloration is modified by the variable intensity of the 

 blackish or brownish postocular bars which margin the lateral carinse 

 ventrad. The dorsum of the head and pronotum is either uniform in 

 color or supplied with a pair of narrow velvety black lines, which 

 diverge caudad and margin the lateral carinse on their internal edge. 

 These lines are variable in intensity and also in continuity, those on 

 the heail sometimes being parallel and again regularly divergent and 

 continuous with their pronotal section. Several individuals from 

 the ]Misiones and Sao Paulo, Brazil, are more or less completely 

 sprinkled with fine blackish-brown punctations, in this respect resem- 

 bling similarly colored individuals of Chlcealtis conspersa and Psolxssa 

 texana. 



The lateral carinse of the pronotum are variable in character, in 

 some individuals being decidedly discontinuous at the transverse 

 sulcus and continuous in others. In the latter specimens the carinse 

 are slightly but regularly divergent through their entire length, 

 while in the other tj'pe they are more or less decidedly offset laterad 

 at the sulcus, subparallel on the prozona and slightly divergent or 

 (more frequently) subparallel on the metazona. These two types 

 have no geographic significance, cannot be correlated with size, and 

 in color only that all of the continuous type have the supplementary 

 dorsal lines of black. Some individuals are almost intermediate 

 in the character of the carinse, and similar variation is found in 

 0. pagana minor. 



The typical form of the species ranges from Rio Janeiro, Brazil 

 west to at least Formosa, Argentina, extending south only as far as 

 Resistericia C'haco and Misiones, Argentina, northward and westward

a geographic race of pagana. The Jujuj- male fully agrees with the 

 cotypic material, and tj^jical individuals of the two forms can be 

 separated by the following features : 



A. — Form more robust; tegmina broader, less elongate; head 

 broader, eyes prominent, shorter, fastigium broad 0. pagana. 



AA. — Form slenderer; tegmina more elongate, narrower; head 

 narrower, eyes less prominent, longer, fastigium- narrow, more 

 elongate 0. pagana minor. 



This race is probably restricted in its typical form to the Bolivian 

 Chaco and the adjacent portions of Argentina (Jujuy). Material 

 from Chapada and Corumbd, Matto Grosso, Brazil, is rather inter- 

 mediate between the present subspecies and true pagana, but some- 

 what closer to minor.

 The female of the present series is the only one of the dozen now 

 before us which does not possess supplementary pronotal carinae. 

 The coloration of this individual is essentially the same as the other 

 two of that sex, l)ut there is no trace of the carinae. Doubtless this 

 genus is .similar in this respect to Eritettix, which has the supple- 

 mentary carinae present or absent in the same species from the same 

 locality." 



Tho localities from which this .species has been recordeil are Cor-

 is correct. Bruner in his last table of species of the genus^ gives 

 full specific rank to these "forms." The San Juan, Caucete and

These individuals are t.vpical of the new "form," which is merely 

 a long-winged phase of punctata, possibly the exclusive or pre- 

 dominating form in certain regions, but found also in a number of 

 localities as we have it in our series from Sapucay, Paraguay (two 

 individuals) and the Misiones (one individual). In the San Juan 

 series green is the predominating color in the females, although one 

 of that sex is brown, as is the Pedregal female. The Misiones series 

 is, with the exception of the "elongata" individual, "elegans" and 

 "intricata" inextricably confused, with typical individuals and 

 intergrades.

These specimens have been compared with paratypic females. 

 We feel compelled to differ from Bruner^ in placing this species in a 

 genus (Amblyscapheus) distinct from Staurorheclus longicornis, the 

 type of the latter genus. We have examined a considerable nmnber 

 of specimens of the two species and find that the two characters given 

 as diagnostic of Amblyscapheus are not in this case important enough 

 to be of generic value. These two are the "entire absence of 

 lateral carinse on the pronotum" and the "valves of the ovipositor 

 very blunt." The first character is one which is very strongly 

 approached if not absolutely reached in our series of longicornis, 

 while the second character, although constant, is of slight degree, 

 not worthy in the present case of generic value. The claim of the 

 genus Amblyscapheus for recognition is, however, completely 

 destroyed by its author in the recent description of a species of the 

 genus Statirorhectus, S. inter medius,^ which has as characters the 

 following: "lateral carin^e of the pronotum almost obliterated on 

 the anterior lobe" and "valves of ovipositor similar to those of 

 Amblyscapheus glaucipcs Rehn (lineatus Bruner)." 



As the male was previouslj- unknown, the following arc its i)rincipal 

 differences from the opposite sex. 



Size small; form similar to that of the female. Head with the 

 eyes slightly more prominent than in the female, face more retreating 

 than in the other sex; interspace between the eyes distinctly narrower 

 than the width of one of the eyes; frohtal costa witl| the margins 

 more subparallel and the sulcus deeper than in the female; antennje

 The former are to our mind prasinus, which varies in the coloration 

 of the dorsum of the pronotum. Our two females agree with the 

 males in the character of the lateral carinaj and the coloration. One 

 of the females is larger than the other, the measurements of the two 

 being as follows:

It is evident that this species has at least two color phases, one 

 largely green and the other several shades of brownish, the latter in 

 the extreme condition with little contrast in tones. In addition to 

 these phases there is one form which has the dorsum of the pronotum 

 uniform in color, and another with broad lateral longitudinal bars of 

 velvety black on the same. The above-listed female and a typical 

 female from Cordoba, loaned by Prof. Bruner, have the uniform 

 pronotum, one in the green phase, the other in the brown phase. 

 The Chacras de Coria male and a female from Cordoba, from Bruner 

 and labelled schulzi by him, have the dorsum of the pronotum 

 barred, the Chacras de Coria male being a well-contrasted brownish 

 inflividual and the female strongly approaching the green phase. 



The lateral carina? of the pronotum are the same in all of the 

 s])ecimens, converging caudad to the first transverse sulcus, thence 

 regularly diverging. In the male the tegmina are proportionately 

 longer than in any other species of the genus and the whole form of

 color, all of the males having their patterns in browns and ochres

This extensive series shows that the species varies tremendously 

 in size and color, in these respects being parallelled by similar variation 

 in the closely allied, if at all di.stinct. North American T. vinculata. 

 The same variations in general size, color tone, width, intensity, 

 solidarity, and curve of tegminal bands, intensity and width of wing 

 band, tone of wing disk and colors of ventral sulcus of caudal femora 

 are noted as in vinculata. 



The rugositj' of the metazonal disk varies individually in both 

 sexes, while the caudal angle of the pronotum shows variants ranging 

 from slightly obtuse to slightly acute, the majority having it rect- 

 angulate. 



The species has a very considerable range, having been recorded 

 from north-central Mexico .south to at least as far as the provinces 

 of Santa FC, ('ordoba, San Luis, and Mendoza, .Argentina.

This very interesting series throws some light on the color phases 

 of the species. It is apparent that three are present: first, a green 

 phase, which was that originally described by Giglio-Tos; second, 

 a brownish or dull wine-colored phase, and, third, a speckled phase. 

 The green phase shows little variation in itself aside from that in the 

 yellowish tone of the green base color and the more or less pronounced 

 character of a j-ellowish wash on the dorsal section of the tegminal 



'' .'Vfter examining the literature involved, we can substantiate what Bruner 

 (.Vnii. Carney. Mus.. VIII, p. 38, footnote) has said regarding the proper .status 

 of Blanchard's giiius Pauliuia. It Ls clearly the same as CalopUrna StAl, which 

 name it should replace, and in no way related to Ossa Giglio-Tos, which 

 through an unfortunate preoccupation must fall, and in place of which Bruner 

 has erected Parossa.

bases.'* The brownish phase varies in tone from pale dull wine color 

 (vinaceous) and clay color to burnt umber, the caudal femora in the 

 extreme condition with more or less apparent transverse dark bars 

 on the dorsal face, and in the same pronounced type the caudal 

 tibiae are of the general tone. The brownish phase and the normal 

 greenish phase are apparently connected by intermediate types, 

 some individuals being of the green phase with the dorsum of the 

 pronotum and the tegmina weakly vinaceous, while other specimens, 

 which otherwise would be referred to the brownish phase, have 

 yellowish the underlying color, the femora unbandetl and the tibise 

 of the glaucous of the green phase. The speckled phase also shades 

 into both of the other forms and is characterized by a mottling of 

 bistre, olive-green, or bay over the underlying bright gamboge to 

 lemon-yellow of the pronotum and head of those specimens approach- 

 ing the green phase and over burnt umber in the single (Jujuy) 

 specimen approaching (or rather in) the brownish phase. These 

 fine mottlings are either general on the dorsum or grouped in 

 two irregular longitudinal bars, which are postocular in their po- 

 sition, the interocular portion of the head also being much suffused. 

 In the extreme condition of this phase the femora are moderately 

 banded dorsad, the tibiae being of the color Avhich the general tone of 

 the individual more nearly approaches. These phases are not 

 geographic, as the Mendoza series has all three, but apparently a 

 certain tj^je is more numerous in one locality than in others. All of 

 the Potrerillos material is either in or very closely approaching the 

 .speckled phase, while, aside from several brownish individuals, all 

 of the Chaeras de Coria representatives are in or wvy near the green 

 phase. 



There is considerable size variation, but this api)ears to be indi- 

 vidual and not geographic. 



The range of the present species is known to extend from the 

 Bolivian Chaeo (Caiza and San Francisco, cotypic individuals being 

 before us) and Jujuy, south to the Provinces of Santa F6 (Carcarana), 

 Cordoba, San Luis (Alto Pencosa), and INIendoza (vide supra).

closer to the former. With Parossa it agrees in the general form of 

 the occiput and interocular region, the reduction of spines on the 

 pronotum and tubercles on the limbs, the non-spiniform ventro- 

 caudal angles of the lateral lobes and the rounded internal angle of 

 the mesosternal lobes; while from Parossa it differs in the subrostrate 

 interantennal portion of the frontal costa, the tuberculate caudal 

 margin of the pronotal disk, the scabrous dorsum of the same, the 

 peculiar coriaceous texture and subnodulose surface of the tegmina, 

 in this respect resembling Ommexecha and Spathalium, and in the' 

 abbreviate, robust form. 



Form robust, abbreviate; surface of head, pronotum, and femora 

 multituberculdte; head, pronotum, venter, and limbs, but particu- 

 larly the latter two, strongly villose. Occiput bullate; interocular 

 region very broad, greatly exceeding the ^^'idth of the eye, greatly 

 declivent, non-mi pressed ; frontal costa subrostrate between the 

 antennje, evanescent ventrad, sulcate dorsad; eyes subglobose. 

 Pronotum robust, greatest dorsal width subequal to its length; 

 prozona hardly elevated, metazona depressed cephalad, transversely 

 elevated caudad; cephalic margin slightly emarginate mesad, caudal 

 margin very broadly obtuse-angulate with three pairs of marginal 

 nodes; lateral lobes with the ventro-caudal angle verj- broadly 

 rounded, non-spiniform. Tegmina broad, sublanceolate, apex 

 moderately rounded; texture coriaceous; surface without decided 

 nodes, but with certain of the transverse veins of the discoidal and 

 anal fields slightly elevated. Wings perfectly developed. Interspace 

 between the mesosternal lobes very decidedly transverse, the margins 

 of the lobes rounded; metasternal interspace more transverse than 

 the mesosternal one.

 (No. 30 and 37.) One male, two females. 



The present specimens are clearly referable to this species, which 

 was pre\iously known only from the original description. Two facts 

 are evident from the material before us, these being that the species 

 is dichromatic and that the length of the tegmina and wings varies 

 greatly in the same. 



The tj'pe was of a greenish color phase, which is almost matched 

 by one of the females in hand, the green of the tegmina apparentlj^ 

 being more extensive than in the tj'pe, as it colors the adjacent 

 portions of the marginal and anal fields of the tegmina as well as the 

 discoidal as described. The other individuals are of a similar pat- 

 tern, but in several tones of brown with no evidence of green. 



The tegmina show considerable length variation as well as some in 

 the form of the apex of the same. The latter may be acute-angulate 

 without anj- trace of bluntness or of similar general outline, with the 

 immediate apex narrowly rounded. The wings are described as 

 "dimidise elj'trorum longitudinis, " while in one of the present females 

 the wings are about two-thirds of the tegminal length, and in the 

 other they fall but little short of the tegminal apices when in repose. 

 In the male the wings are subequal to the tegmina when closed. 



The measurements of the present material and of the type are as 

 follows : 



^ The specimens from Chapada, Matto Grosso, Brazil, recorded bj' us as 

 Spathalium cyaiiopterum iProc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XXXVI, p. 110), we find on 

 re-oxamination to be S. kluffii (Burmeister), which Bolivar synonjTiiized under 

 S. xcrrulaliiui Thunborf;, the type of Burmei.ster's species having been examined 

 by him. There seems no doubt but that his description of " serrulaium" was in 

 part drawn from this specimen. On examination of the original description of 

 serrulntum we have been unable to jwsitively place the species, but it does not 

 seem to be the same as klugii. Kirby (Syn. Catal. Orth., Ill, p. 298) has given 

 the synonj'my correctly and permitted both names to stand. Bruner, unfortu- 

 nately, has redescribcd hlutfii as .S. holivari (Ann. Carneg. .Mita,, VIII, p. 39). 

 Our material fully agrees with his description and that of Burmeister and of 

 Bolivar.

All of these specimens, except the March 30 female, have the 

 tegmina distinctly maculate, the exception having the discoidal field 

 with the faintest possible indication of the usual blotching. The 

 male and female taken March 30 were in coitu, and the two represent 

 the extremes in maculation of the discoidal field of the tegmina. 

 The anal field of the tegmina is unicolorous in all of the specimens.

The Buenos Aires specimens are typical of the species, while the 

 Misiones series is referred here with some doul^t, differing mucH 

 as does the Sapucaj-, Paraguay representation previously examined 

 by us." The pronotum is, in the Misiones specimens, more compressed 

 than in Buenos Aires individuals, the fastigium shorter and broader 

 in the male, being more of an equilateral triangle, and the coloration 

 different, the median line of the pronotum being much narrower, 

 while the humeral regions of the pronotum of the male are washed 

 with dull purplish and the caudal tibiae of the same sex are wax yellow 

 to pale orange, without reddish as in typical viridicala. The females 

 have the tibite green as in Buenos Aires specimens, the spines and 

 tarsi usually without sanguineous, although this is indicated in 

 two Misiones individuals. It is probable that the Sapucaj' and 

 Misiones series are specifically or subspecifically distinct from 

 viridicata, but we have refrained from recognizing their differences 

 with a name. It seems more desirable at present to get a better 

 conception of the real value of these differences, which can only be 

 done by the acquisition of more material from a number of localities. 



This species has been recorded from points ex^'ending from the type 

 locality north to Chapada, Matto Gros.so, Brazil.

We have before us specimens from Meridd, Yucatan, contained 

 in the Hebard Collection, which agree absolutely with the original 

 description of miles. The material from Argentina and Paraguay 

 shows certain constant differences which have already been empha- 

 sized by Pictet and Saussure.^' Any expression of the exact rela- 

 tionship of the material from the two regions seems best withheld, 

 until at least sufficient .series from other localities can be examined, 

 thus enabling us to judge more clearlj- how constant over definite 

 regions apparent differences are. The Merida individuals, seven in 

 number, are constant and typical. All of the Argentine and Para- 

 guayan specimens seen are duller with the pale maculations more 

 orange-rufous than j'ellow, the wings with the pale areas brick red 

 or orange, the pale occipital bars narrower and the pale areas of the 

 caudal margin of the pronotum usually not continuous, but broken 



" In studying the present series of this species we have made a rather extensive 

 re-examination of our material of this and allied forms, as well as the literature 

 bearing on the subject. It is in consequence necessary to correct certain previous 

 references which are erroneous on account of a confusion of milc/s and slolli.

Male. Female, 



mm. mm. mm. mm. 



Length of body 27. 32.5 35. 49.5 



Length of pronotum 6.2 7.5 8.9 12.2 



Length of tegmen 24.5 26. 32.5 37. 



Length of caudal femur 14.7 17. 19. 25.5 



There is also an appreciable amount of variation in the general 

 form, some specimens, irrespective of sex, being more compressed 

 than others, more noticeablj' so in the male than in the female, and 

 quite irrespective of locality. A casual examination would lead 

 one to suppose that two species were present, but careful studj^ shows 

 that the e.xtremes cannot be separated on account of the intermediate 

 individuals. The median carina of the pronotum shows some varia- 

 tion in prominence in both sexes. 



In color there is marked variation in the shade of blue on the tlisk 

 of the wing, in some individuals this being nile blue, flax flower blue 

 (Ridgway) in others, running through heliotrope purple to phlox 

 purple. This variation does not appear to be correlated with sex, 

 locality, size, or degree of compression. The caudal tibise also vary 

 in general color from cream to scarlet vermilion dorsad, with the 

 ventral surface very pale apple green. 



Information with one .specimen is to the effect that the species is 

 gregarious. Its range is known to extend from Chapada, Matto 

 Grosso (Bruner), and Rio Grande do Sul (Ilehn), Brazil, to the 

 Misiones.

This series is verj' constant in coloration aside from a slight 

 variation in the depth of the ground color of the head. The Jujuy 

 individual, alone of the series, has the proximal portion of the external 

 face of the caudal femora more olive green than in the other specimens 

 and blending into the blackish disto-median band. There is no 

 tendency' in the series to approach the Brazilian Z. tarsata (Scrvillc). 



The northern limit of the range of the present species is not defi- 

 nitely known, as most of the records are confused with tarsata, but to 

 the southward, where cruentata alone is found, its range is given by 

 Bruner as "central and northern Argentina." The above records 

 and that from Buenos Aires (Giglio-Tos) are the most southern 

 definitely known ones.

 agreeing with this color, while the darker pronotal bars var\' from 

 dark oil green to purplish brown; the dark areas of the pleura and

This species appears to us to be an Atrachelacris and not a Dichro- 

 plus as described. From A. unicolor it differs in the more elongate 

 and distad subfalcate cerci of the male, more compressetl form, 

 broader fastigium, broader and distinctly sulcate dorsal section of 

 the frontal costa, sliorter and smaller eyes and more mottled greenish 

 coloration. There is no close relationship of this form to A . gramineus^ 

 Bruner. '^ 



In addition to the above specimens, we have before us a single 

 female from Sapucay, Paraguay (Hebard Collection), taken January 

 20, 1905 (Foster). The only difference worthy of note is that in the 

 Sapucay female the fastigium is ev(>n wider than in the Misiones 

 female. 



The localities from which the species is known are Chapada, Matto 

 Grosso, Brazil, Sapucay, Paraguay, and tlie Misiones, Argentina.

The Buenos Aires and San Juan individuals are similar in 

 coloration to four specimens from Carcarana, Argentina, the San 

 Juan female being slightly smaller than the others of that sex. The 

 La Carlota, Mendoza, and San Ignacio representatives are very 

 somberly colored with little contrast in the markings, the general- 

 tone varying from broccoli brown to clove brown. The La Carlota 

 specimens have the reduction in contrast more decided than in any 

 of the other individuals, while in size they average larger than the 

 Carcarana specimens. The females from San Juan and Mendoza 

 Provinces are all slightly or considerably smaller than Carcarana or

This very interesting series of one hundred and eleven specimens 

 shows that considerable variation in size and color is present in the 

 species. Apparently the size variation is more geographic and 

 en^-ironmental than individual. The San Juan and Caucete series 

 are very similar in proportions and size, such individual variation in 

 the latter as is noticed being found in both lots. The La Paz, Pedre- 

 gal, Mendoza, and large portion of the Chacras de Coria and San 

 Ignacio series are uniformly smaller, with shorter tegmma and 

 consequent more robu.st appearance. Two males and two females 

 from San Ignacio and several males from Chacras de Coria are similar 

 in general form to the San Juan and Caucete lots. A single male 

 from Mendoza is of similar proportions, but the size is no greater 

 than the other Mendoza specimens. Apparently at these three 

 localities the differences are enviromuental, as they are decided and 

 correlated with color characters. Such differences produced by 

 similar agencies are frequently found m species of the allied North 

 American genus Melanoplus. 



The first color type, which almost invarialily has longer tegmina 

 than the second, is always paler, the base color ^-arj-ing from buff to 

 nearly ochraceous, with the median portion of the dorsmn more or 

 less suffused with tawny to chestnut. The postocular bars are always 

 decidedly indicated and the base color of the femora and tibia; in 

 the two forms varies with the general base color. The second type 

 has the base color nearer gamboge and saffron yellow, but little 

 evident, however, as the overlying suffusion of from clove brown to 

 clay color Ls, as a rule, heavier and more extensive than in the first 

 type, permitting less contrast between the region of the postocular 

 bars and other areas. The females of this latter type are much 

 duller than the male. The dark suffusion of the sharply delimited 

 dorsal two-thirds or so of the external face of the caudal femora 

 varies greatly in intensity, usually more solid and darker in the 

 individuals of the second tyjie. 



Representative indiviiluals of both sexes taken at random from 

 the larger series measure as follows:

This series shows considerable color and size variation, the mo.st 

 striking of which is found in a single female from Misiones, which is 

 di-stinctly larger than the average of the species and has the proximo- 

 dorsal pale band on the caudal femora and the "hour-glass "-.shaped 

 figure on the dorsum of the pronotum cream-buff, in striking contrast 

 to the remainder of the body color. 



This widely distributed species ranges south as far as the Rio

We have before us, in addition to the above series, two pairs of 

 typical material from Rosario, received from Bruner. It is evident 

 that the insect varies greatly in size, wholly individually so it appears. 

 The Mendoza series alone contains specimens of both se.xcs showing 

 this very clearly, the extremes of both sexes measuring as follows: 

 length of body, cT 14. 3-17. .5 mm., 9 20-24.2; length of prunotuni, 

 (f 3.3-4, 9 4i,2-6; length of tegmen, cf .5.2-0.8, 9 7-9.2; length of 

 caudal fennir, cf 8.6-9..5, 9 11-13. All of the individuals in the 

 present scries are brachypterous. 



In color the variation is considerable, but ajJiiarently this is almost 

 wholly geographic. The series from Mendoza Province have a more

olive green tone than any of the Caucete or San Juan specimens, 

 which are more yellowish on the pale areas and more contrastingly 

 colored.

 .intensity of the broad postocular Ijars. The caudal til)ise of all the 

 Misiones and Mendoza individuals are decided deep glaucous blue, 

 the Buenos Aires specimen agreeing with Rosario and Carcarana 

 representatives in having these oil green. In the series from 

 Sapucaj-, Paraguay, previously recorded by us," the color of the 

 tibiae is deep indigo blue in about half of the males and deep oil green 

 in all of the females, the remainder of the males varying in this

Closer to L. hastahis Rehn** than to any other species of the genus, 

 but differing from that in the smaller size, distinctly narrower and 

 less declivent fastigium, which is also more decidedly excavate, the 

 more compressed pronotum, more angulate caudal margin of the 

 disk of the pronotum, the different sculpture of the supra-anal plate, 

 in the more elongate cerci, which are subfalcate distad, and in the 

 less produced subgenital plate. The color of the caudal tibiae 

 immediatelj- separates this species from flavipes Bruner, but in addi- 

 tion to that the present species can I)e distinguished by the narrower 

 di.«tal section of the cerci, shorter subgenital plate, anil less declivent 

 and more excavate fastigium. The female is verj- similar to that sex 

 of flavipes, but the pronotum is more constricted, with the caudal 

 margin of the lateral lobes straightcr and more vertical, and the tibi;B 

 are red.

brunneri Giglio-Tos than to any of the other forms of the genus. 

 From the former it can be immediately separated by the absence of 

 decided lobiform furcula, while from the latter it can readily be 

 distinguished by the heavier, deeper head, the more vertical face, the 

 more elongate supra-anal plate, the more tapering and strongly 

 incurved cerci, the less produced subgenital plate and very different 

 coloration. 



Size medium; form robust. Head not elevated dorsad of the k-vel 

 of the pronotum, the interocular region and the fastigium regularly 

 declivent; interocular width moderate, slightly greater than the 

 interantennal width of the frontal costa, hardly more than a 

 third the width of the eye; fastigium distincth' transverse, margins 

 distinct and rectangulate, surface of the fastigium and the inter- 

 ocular portion of the vertex very slightly excavate;" face moderately 

 retreating, subvertical for a very short distance dorsad, forming a 

 slight obtuse angle at the junction with the fastigium; frontal costa 

 in general subequal in width, the average breadth slightly less than 

 that of the interocular portion of the vertex, strongly narrowing 

 dorsad to the junction with the fastigium, slightly narrowed imme- 

 diately ventrad of the ocellus, sulcate throughout; antennae about 

 two and one-half times the length of the pronotum; eye not at all 

 prominent when seen from above, in outline reniform-ovate,

 Abdominal segments with a distinct median longitudinal carina; 

 furcula present as very brief trigonal acute subcontiguous fingers; 

 supra-anal plate trigonal, the margins regularly converging, the apex 

 acute, sulcate mesad for the entire length of the plate, a pair of 

 deeper and broader converging lateral depressions separated from 

 the median sulcation by low ridges; eerci slightly exceeding the 

 supra-anal plate in length, styliform, the base broad, thence 

 regularly narrowing to the blunt apex, the narrowing being wholly 

 due to the oblique excision of the ventral margin, the dorsal margin 

 being straight, when seen from the dorsum the distal two-thirds of 

 the cercus is regularly incurved; subgenital plate broad, the proximal 

 width considerably exceeding the length of the lateral margin, when 

 seen from the side the lateral margin is straight, when seen from the 

 dorsum the margins are seen to be converging at an acute angle, the 

 apex slightly produced and labiate. Cephalic and median femora 

 considerablj- inflated and bowed. Caudal femora about two and 

 one-half times as long as the pronotum, rather slender; caudal 

 tibiae armed on the external margin with nine spines. 



General color of the dorsum prout's brown. Head with the face 

 and cephalic portion of the genie tawny-olive, remainder of the genae 

 shining seal brown, partially separated from a postocular area of the 

 same color by a blotch of naples yellow, the postocular section being 

 bordered dorsad by a narrow edging of the same yellow; eyes ochra- 

 ceous; antennae ochraeeous-rufous. Pronotum with a distinct 

 subequal arcuate postocular bar of shining seal brown, the dorsal 

 margin of which is weakened and poorly defined; ventral portion 

 of the lateral lobes naples yellow, sharply delimited dorsad and with 

 a ventral marginal edging of seal brown. Tegmina bistre with a very 

 narrow marginal line of naples yellow dorsad. Venter of the thorax

 Tegmina two and two-thirds times as long as the head and pronotum, 

 acute lanceolate, the greatest width in the proximal half, distad of 

 which the tegmina taper to the narrowly rounded apex; marginal 

 field in the proximal third of the tegmina but little narrower than 

 the width of the discoidal field in the same region, thence rather

 to that of mendocensis, but the marginal field is slightly broader 

 and the discoidal vein has two distinct rami. Exposed portion of 

 the wings twice the length of the pronotum, apex slightly less acute

The short ovipositor and gradually tapering tegmina, which have 

 the marginal field not sharply narrowed and unmarked with white, 

 will readily separate this species. 



Size medium; form little compressed. Head with the fa.stigium

This series shows very considerable variation in size and coloration. 

 In size, the only specimen equalling individuals from Sapucay, 

 Paraguay, previously measured^^ is the single female from the Mis- 

 iones, all the other representatives being slightly or considerably 

 smaller. In color, green is the predominating shade, Ijut individuals 

 with buff the base color are from Potrerillos, Mendoza, Chacras de 

 Coria, and Corrientes, while two Jujuy females are much darker, 

 their base tone being clay color. In all of the brownish individuals 

 the infuscation of the dorsal section of the lateral lobes of the 

 pronotum and the continuation of the same marking distad over the 

 tegmina, margining the tympanum, and the anal field of the same, 

 is more or less decided and umber in color. In the Jujuy individuals 

 these areas are very strongly indicated, the tegmina also being 

 decidedly maculate on the discoidal field with the same shade. Thi.s 

 latter condition is suggested in certain of the buffy specimens. 



The species has also been recorded from Buenos Aires (Bruner) 

 and Santa Rosa, Salta (Giglio-Tos), Argentina, and Sapucay, Para-

It seems probable that L. borreUii Giglio-Tos^^ is either a synomin 

 of the present species or certain of its supposed diagnostic characters 

 are not constant, such as the black median line on the dorsum of the 

 abdomen, which is strongly indicated in most of the specimens (five 

 in all) before us and almo.st completely absent in one. The character 

 of insertion of the lateral lobes of the pronotum is susceptible of much 

 latitude in individual interpretation, while the length of the ovipositor 

 and degree of angulation of the subgenital plate are not hard-and-fast 

 characters, as in the first case personal equation is a factor in deter- 

 mining the base of the ovipositor and in the second case the condition 

 of the specimen and the amount of flexure and compression of the 

 plate may lead to different conclusions. 



These specimens have been compared with individuals from

This very interesting series gives us some desirable and definite 

 information on the extent of variation in this variable species as 

 found at a single locality. All of the specimens of the pre.sent species 

 are in the color phase which has metallic blue the mo.st striking color 

 characteristic. The variation here noted arc all aside from this base 

 color. The color of the tegmina also remains nearly uniform in the 

 series, varying only moderately in the dejith of the ferruginous or 

 hazel of the same, the distal blackish area jiresent on the tegmina of 

 all of the specimens seen. The pale maculation on the facial fastigium 

 and that on the fastigium of the vertex are invariably pre.sent, as is 

 the broad patch of the same on the ventral portion of the lateral 

 lobes of the pronotum and the oblique pale line on the pleura. The 

 dorsum of the pronotum may be without pale markings, with a single 

 small median pair or with an increasing immbcr of pairs up to four, 

 these always arranged along the median line and variable in size, but 

 always in .symmetrical pairs. Frequently the pairs run together, 

 forming bars, which tendency in a single- extreme specimen is so 

 complete that we have paired pale lines extending from the cciihalic

to the caudal margins of the disk. The antennae may or may not" 

 be broadlj' annulate with huffy. In every case the caudal femora 

 have a median huffy white patch. 



In size there is considerable individual variation. 



The species has been recorded from localities extending from 



Buenos Aires and ^lontevideo south to Patagonia and west to 



Santiago, Chile.

The present specimens answer the original description very well, 

 except that the last article of the palpi bears no black and the wings 

 are fully developed and caudate. The latter fact shows the species 

 to be dimorphic in wing length. The general appearance of the 

 species is very similar to that of iV. longipennis, but ntfus can be 

 separated from the latter by having the ovipositor longer, the dorsal 

 margin of the apex of the same serrulate instead of serrate and the 

 disto-dorsal spurs of the caudal tibiae unequal in length instead of 

 ecjual.

NOTES UPON SOME LOWER CALIFORNIAN HELICES. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The receipt of some Helices collected on Cerros (Cedros) Islaud, 

 Lower California, by Mr. H. X. Lowe, has been made the occasion 

 for giving plates illustrating the Micrariontas of Lower California 

 and offering some notes upon the characters, variation, distribution, 

 and type localities of the several forms. Information upon the 

 habitats and stations of several species may be found in an article 

 by Mr. Lowe in the Nautilus for July, 1913. 



The only recent work of an exact nature upon these snails is in a 

 paper published by Doctor W. H. Dall in Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. 

 Phila. for 1900, in which several new forms are defined. The fauna 

 stands much in need of investigation by some one who can study the 

 snails on the ground; who will look into the limits and characteristics 

 of the snail colonies, locate them exactly, and keep the snails of 

 different colonies separate. At present we have little knowledge of 

 the association of forms or the range of variation within a colony. 



The first Helices from the Lower Californian coast seem to have 

 been collected by Dr. Hinds, who accompanied Capt. Belcher as 

 surgeon of H. M. S. Sulphur. The Sulphur was engaged in work 

 of survey and exploration along the West Coast in 1839, and oi)por- 

 tunity for land collecting was had at San Diego and various points 

 northward, San Quintin, Cerros Island, Turtle (San Bartolom6) 

 Bay, and Magdalena Bay. Two species collected by Hinds were 

 described by Pfeiffer in 1845, Helix levis and H. areolata, both re- 

 ported, in the original descriptions, as from "California," whether 

 Lower or Upper not specified: moreover, at the time of the Sulphur 

 voyage the differentiation of the Californias seemed a small matter 

 to Europeans, i)oth being equally savage and remote. 



During 1846 the Herald and Pandora surveyed parts of the coast — 

 Victoria, Esquimalt Harbor, Port Discovery, Port Townsend, San 

 Francisco Bay, San Nicolas, S. Clemente, San Diego Bay, Los 

 Coronados, San Quintin, Cerros Island, Magdalena Bay.' A number

of West Coast shells were collected, but unfortunately the localities 

 were badly mixed up, as in the Sulphur shells. 



Good accounts of the explorations of Veatch, Gabb, Scamraon, and 

 others of that period together with much historical and other infor- 

 mation concerning the peninsula maj' be found in a book issued by 

 the Lower California Company, entitled, "Lower California: Its 

 Geography and Characteristics," New York, 1868. The most exten- 

 sive recent reports by .scientific observers are those published by the 

 California Academy of Sciences. These deal chiefly with the Cape 

 region, which differs witlely from the penuisula further north by reason 

 of its far greater rainfall. 



Helicoid and Bulimoid landsnails livmg in exposed places usually 

 become inore variegated than the related forms from sheltered or 

 shaded places. When exposed to the sun, the ground color or the 

 whole shell becomes opaque white, an adaptation to exclude light, 

 which would shine through a browm, corneous, or yellowish shell, 

 probably to the detriment of the snail. Compare Cerion, Hemi- 

 trochis, Bulimulus schiedeanus, Leucochroa, etc. Among snails living 

 in dry, sunny places, there is also verj' often a tendency to multiply 

 color-bands, in snails derived from stocks with one or few bands, 

 as in Euparypha, Hemitrochus, Plectostylus, etc. This may possibly 

 be protective, as a variegated shell is less conspicuous on a bush or 

 weed than a one-colored shell. 



The enhanced color development and variability of snails living 

 on trees or other plants lead to the formation of color varieties from 

 diverse variations in different colonies. Where the topographic 

 and other environmental conditions favor isolation of colonies, 

 permanent races or species result, as among the Partidce and Achati- 

 nellfe. When the colonies occasionallj- mingle by changing condi- 

 tions of vegetation, etc., we have polymorphic hj'brid races — 

 colonies where great individual diversity of pattern or form are seen. 



Lower California, exclusive of the Cape region, is probably an area 

 of increasing aridity, like southern Arizona and Sonora, so that there 

 is now a strong tendency towards restriction and consequent isolation 

 of the snail colonies. The rather wide distribution of some of the 

 species and the polymorphic coloration of many colonies leads us to 

 believe that conditions formerh' were much more favorable to migra- 

 tion and mingling of land snails. Subsidence has also played a part 

 in isolating the snails of the small islands along the coast. That the 

 changes have often been unfavorable is shown by the dwarfed size of 

 many races, as on San Geronimo, Xatividatl, and Asuncion Islands. 




382 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [^lay, 



The irregular apertural thickening, lumps, and uneven "teeth" of 

 some forms of .1/. levis and others show the unfavorable action of 

 extreme aridity .- 



The apparent absence of HelicidiB on the comparatively well- 

 watered southern end of the peninsula is an anomaly. I cannot 

 help thmkmg that further search will bring some Helices to light. 

 It is a region of fine Bulirauli. 



In the northeastern part of the peninsula and on the Coronado 

 Islands, Micrarionta stearnsiana Gabb is found.' Farther down and 

 inland the closely related M. orcutti Dall occurs. This seems to be 

 constant in its divergence from stearnsiana in the large lot I have 

 seen. Far off shore on Guadalupe Island is the small M. guadalu- 

 piana Dall, a perfectly distinct species of the typical group of Micra- 

 rionta. 



On the sierra rumiing down the peninsula near the eastern border 

 there are several Sonorella-like species, such as Helix lohrii Gal)b, 

 imknown anatomically, but probably belonging to the desert group 

 of Micrarionta characteristic of southwestern Arizona and south- 

 eastern California. 



Micrarionta consists of three rather sharply differentiated groups 

 or sections: (1) Micrarionta typical, small, compact shells with the 

 lip strongly reflexed, insular in distribution, M. ruficincta, gabbi, 

 facta, guadalupiana. (2) Section Erenmrionta for M. desertorum 

 P. & F., includes also M. hutsoni Clapp and probably all the Cah- 

 fornian and Lower Californian species which have been referred to 

 So7ioreUa. The lip is expanded, shell smooth. (3) Section Xerarionta 

 for the capacious forms with the lip not expanded or but slightly so, 

 the axis perforate or closed, the shell generally variegated, many- 

 banded. M. veatckii may be taken as the type of this group, which 

 extends from the Channel Islands of California to Magdalena Bay, 

 on the islands and adjacent shore.

locality uncertain. On p. 53 of Forbes' article, he states that "Helix 

 kellettii and pandorw, both new, are probablj' from the same comitry 

 [i.e., neighborhood of the Columbia River], though the box in which 

 they were contained was marked Santa Barbara. " On p. 55 he says, 

 "collected near the Straits of Juan del Fuaco [Fuca]."* 



The Santa Barbara Island Helix of this type is tryoni Newc. H. 

 pandorw must have come from some southern locality. Since speci- 

 mens exactl}' resembling Forbes' figure were taken by Anthony and 

 others on San Benito Island, off the north end of Cerros Island, that 

 place may for the present be taken as the type locality, as no other 

 place has yet afforded shells agreeing so well with Forbes' figures. 



San Benito, or "Los Benitos, " is west of the north end of Cerros 

 Island and consists of two or three small and verj' barren islets. 

 The name has also been spelled "San Bonito"" (Captain C. M. 

 Scammon) . 



Though we are considering Los Benitos the type locality of H. 

 pandorce, it must be said that we have no definite information of 

 where the original lot was taken. The Herald touched Cerros Island, 

 and left the Pandora behind to complete the survey. No further 

 report of the movements of the Pandora is given in the narrative, 

 but it is not unlikely that S. Benito was v'isited in the course of the 

 survey. The fact that Forbes named the species for the Pandora 

 may be taken, in the absence of any information to the contrary, as 

 some indication that it was obtained by members of the Pandora's 

 surveying party. 



The locality "Santa Barbara, on ^Margarita Baj', Lower California, 

 Forbes," quoted by Dall, I am unable to confirm, as I can find no 

 place or bay so named on the coast of Lower California, on maps 

 accessible to me. 



Dall has noted that this small species "varies from white to dark 

 gray above, and below may be white or banded ^\^th ashy-gray. 

 The nucleus is, however, invariably of a livid purplish color, and the 

 surface is dull and conspicuously striate." It is sometimes pure 

 white (pi. XV, fig. 23), or has a few diffuse reddish-purple bands 

 on the last whorl (pi. XV, figs. 21, 22), the apex whitish or dark 

 (fig. 22 photographed abnormally dark). 



The typical form (pi. XV, figs. 17, 18,' 19, 20) is dull purplish above 

 and banded below the periphery on a creamy ground, the apex purple

or reddish. The lip is very slightly expanded, narrowly white- 

 bordered within, and the columellar margin concave with no trace of 

 a tooth. The embryonic whorl, when unworn, has radial wrinkles 

 as in veatchii; the spire is not granular, and the last whorl shows 

 .spiral incised lines. Alt. 15, diam. 18 mm., 4f whorls. It was this 

 form which I dissected, under the name of "E. p. bonitosensis." 



M. pandorce is anatomically similar to veatchii on a smaller scale. 

 It belongs, I think, nearer veatchii than to any other species. As in 

 other races of these small arid islands, pandorije is conspicuously 

 reduced in size, probably through the continuous influence of short 

 active and long dormant periods. 



The specimens figured are from S. Benito Island, collected b\' 

 Anthony and Hemphill.

A fine species, knowTi by its large size, turbinate, elevated shape 

 (which, however, is variable), and the coloration, somewhat like 

 Helix aspersa, but also very variable; the embryonic shell when 

 unworn is finely irregularly wrinkled radially. There is never any 

 trace of a columellar tooth. It was described from Cerros Island, 

 where Veatch collected it in 1859, and the typical form at least is 

 confined to that place. 



In specimens collected at the north end of Cerros Island by Mr. 

 H. N. Lowe in 1912 (pi. XV, figs. 2, 3), the foot and sole are pale 

 gray, back brownish-gray, paler towards the shell, near the edge 

 yellowish-gray, under a lens seen to be closely peppered with yellow 

 dots on a dark gray grountl. A specimen of the same lot having the 

 shell light colored (pi. XV, fig. 1) has the animal gray-brown through- 

 out, a little darker on the hack. The tail is depressed, back with 

 the usual pair of grooves. In walking, the muscular waves extend 

 entirely across the sole, ami are about 5 mm. apart, more separated 

 towards the tail. Foot about 60 nun. long. The shell in this lot 

 (pi. XV, figs. 1, 2, 3) varies notably in degree of elevation and in 

 color. The ground is pink-white; some shells are boldly marked 

 with blacki.sh-chocolate bands, as many as eleven in fig. -i. Others 

 have the shoulder band well developed, several others weakly traced, 

 fig. 2. In others, all tiie hands present are very weak, fig. I : or again, 

 tiie slioulder band alone is inilicated hv an interrunted dark fillet.

■Granulation is weakly developed on the second and third whorls, 

 and incised spiral lines are well developed on the last whorl. 



The type lot of veatchii consists of smaller shells, pi. XV, figs. 6, 7, 

 in which the bands number 9 or 10, are brown or blackish and more 

 or less speckled. Fine, distinct granulation (as in levis) may be seen 

 on the second and third whorls. The incised spirals of the last whorl 

 are weak and much interrupted. The lip is slightly expanded, the 

 callus within making it appear more expanded than it really is. 

 This feature is rather poorly sho^vn in the figures because of the 

 darkness of the interiors in the photographs. In M. levis there is 

 little or no expansion of the lip. 



The largest individual seen measures, alt. 26§, diam. 28| mm. 

 It was collected by Hemphill (pi. XV, fig. 5). The highest in a 

 series sent by Mr. H. N. Lowe measures, alt. 26|, diam. 205 mm.i 

 with 65 whorls (fig. 2) ; and the lowest, in the same lot, is, alt. 24^, 

 diam. 28 mm., 5f whorls (fig. 1). The types were smaller, about 

 23 X 23 mm. Two of the type lot are figured, pi. XV, figs. 6, 7. In 

 these the spiral incised lines are less developed than in the larger 

 forms. The lip is less broadly expanded in many specimens, as in 

 fig. 4, collected by Gabb. 



Besides the typical elevated form already noticed, there are several 

 more or less divergent forms found on Cerros Island. I have referred 

 to these by nmnber, as their status cannot be discussed intelligently 

 until careful field work locates the colonies and gives material for a 

 study of the variations in each. 



(1) M. veatchii leucanthea Dall, from the eastern side of Cerros 

 Island (pi. XV, fig. 10, a cotype, U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 107,627) is 

 exactly like the lower forms of veatchii in shape of the shell and the 

 rather broadly e.xpanded lip. It differs by the absence of distinct 

 bands on the pink-white surface and the more distinct granulation 

 of the entire upper surface. The shell figured measures, alt. 23, 

 diam. 26 mm., with b^ whorls. 



(2) Shells collected on Cerros Island by Hemphill, what part of 

 the island not stated, resemble leucanthea in shape and sculpture, but 

 differ in having the lip expaiLsion very narrow. In one lot (pi. XV, 

 figs. 15, 16) the fleshy-brown bands vary from weak and "curdled" 

 (like the traces of a band in leucanthea) to moderately strong. 



(3) In another lot (pi. XV, figs. 13, 14) the last whorl has a pale 

 brown tint; there are no bands whatever, but the surface is strewn 

 with purplish-gray dots, translucent by transmitted light.- The 

 lip cxijunds very narnjwly. 




386 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 'Mav,. 



(4) Natividad Island, off the south end of Cerros. A shell col- 

 lected by Anthony and sent me alive by Dr. Dall (pi. XV, fig. 12) is 

 banded and streaked profusely with purplish-bro\\'n. The embryo 

 is distinctly wrinkled and the inner whorls following are somewhat 

 granulated; lip narrow. Alt. 21, diam. 23.8 mm., with 5^ whorls. 

 The genitalia of this individual were figured by me as "areolata" In 

 Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1898, pi. 1, figs. 6, 7. It certainly has nothing 

 to do with the real areolala, but belongs to the veatchii group of forms. 



(5) Turtle Bay, collected by Hemphill (pi. XV, fig. 9), white or 

 pink-white, immaculate or with a few fleshy dots. Embryonic 

 whorl wrinkled, the rest of the upper surface granulated more or 

 less, lip verj' narrow. Resembles varieties (2) and (3), except in 

 color. 



(6) Turtle Bay, Hemphill (pi. XV, fig. 8). The white or pale 

 embrj'onic whorl is nearly smooth (in 8 adult shells examined, no 

 young ones seen); granulation appears weakly on the inner whorls, 

 not on the last one or two. Lip expansion is narrow. The shell is 

 compactly coiled. Bands speckled with white, either numerous, a.s 

 in fig. 8, or reduced in number and intensity (as in fig. 15). Alt. 20, 

 diam. 23 mm., with 5^ whorls. This lot was sent out by Hemphill 

 as "H. areolata var. " 



(7) Turtle Bay (pi. XV, fig. 11). Same as No. 6, but white with 

 the coloring of leucanthea, plus some scattered fleshy dots. 



Whether all of the Turtle Bay lots were from one colony or from 

 several is not known. 'Sir. Hemphill sorted out his Helices into 

 color forms, thereby destroying all evidence as to the composition of 

 the colonies. 



M. veatchii was named in honor of John A. Veatch, who surveyed 

 Cerros Island in search of copper and other minerals in June, July, 

 and August, 1859. By an error or oversight the name was spelled 

 "veitchii" in the original account.

Fig. 1. — Micrarionla v. canescens (A. & R.), South Bay, Cerros Island. 



The Samarang surveyed from Japan to Borneo, going and return- 

 ing by the Cape route. They did not reach American shores, and 

 touched Africa only at the Cape, where no such species as H. 

 canescens is found. It seems to be one of several species without 

 definite locality which Reeve inserted. Captain Belcher who com- 

 manded the Samarang had previously explored Cerros Island in the 

 Sulphur, and probably he added H. canescens to the Samarang shells 

 from his former collection. 



By its columellar tooth M. canescens has affinity to ilf. levis. 

 Whether it will eventually be united to veatchii or to levis remains 

 to be decided, but it seems deserving of at least subspecific rank.

 46 [tj'pographical error for 16] mm. Variety: with a sharplj- defined, 

 lengthened, tooth-like tubercle on the lower margin near the colu- 

 mella (fig. 16)." 



Pfeiffer's figure of the type, pi. XVI, fig. 51, and of the variety 

 pi. XVI, fig. 52, are copied photographically. 



This is a rather small species (diam. 17 to 20 mm.), compactly 

 coiled, rather solid though generally somewhat thin, opaque white 

 or very light brown, encircled with many blackish lines and narrow 

 bands, which are more or leas interrupted or speckled with white. 

 The embryonic whorl is usually brown, rarely whitish. The surface 

 of several post-embryonic whorls is minutelj^ granulated. The last 

 whorl is not distinctly striated spirally. Lip hardly expanded, 

 narrowly thickened within, at the columella it is dilated, and white- 

 calloused within, the callus often ending abruptly below, or in form 

 of a small tooth. Whorls 5 in small, up to 5| in large individuals. 



Specimens in the Academy are from San Rosario (Orcutt!); San 

 Geronimo Island, fossil only (H. X. Lowe!); Lagoon Heads, Cerros 

 Island, and Turtle Bay (H. Hemphill!); Asuncion Island, fossil only 

 (Stearns). Also reported by Dall from Rosalia Bay, lietweeu the 

 second and third localities above. 



Pfeiffer records that this species was taken by Hinds in "Cali- 

 fornia." Hinds, on H. M. S. Sulphur, Capt. Belcher, visited Cali- 

 fornia and Lower California, stopping October 28, 1839, at Turtle 

 Bay, which is another name for S. Bartolome Bay, or Port, a good 

 harbor a short distance below the projection of the peninsula below 

 Cerros Island. As Hemphill found the species here in some abun- 

 dance, I propose to select Port San Bartolome as the tj'pe locality. 

 The Sulphur landed a party at this place to make observations for 

 position. The geological features and marine shells are mentioned 

 in Captain Beechey's narrative (Vol. I, p. 330), and I think it ahnost 

 certain that Hinds, who wa-s a good collector and conchologist, 

 picked up the Helix levis here. 



Small specimens, such as pi. XVI, fig. 45, and others of the same 

 lot agree perfectly with Pfeiffer's description and his type figure. 

 Others from Turtle Bay, such as figs. 42, 43, are largQr, more elabo- 

 rately decorated, and show more of a columellar tooth. 



Shells from San Rosario, Cerros Island (fig. 44), and Lagoon Heads 

 are practically identical with those from Turtle Bay. All of these 

 places except Cerros Island arc on the mainland. Other localities.

have varj"ing forms, which for the present I have designated by 

 numbers, as follows: 



(1) Asuncion Island, not far below Turtle Bay, has a somewhat 

 differing race (pi. XVI, fig. 48). The bands, translucent instead of 

 brown, are usually fewer and broader — five or sbc, or sometimes as 

 many as ten. Granulation indistinct or obsolete. Diam. 16 to 

 19 mm. All the specimens seen from this tiny, barren islet were 

 dug out of fine sand. It probably occurs only fossil. It is much 

 like Pfeiffer's figures of levis, but the granulation is scarcely visible. 



(2) Var. crassula Dall (pi. XV, fig. 24) from Natividad Island 

 (south of Cerros) is like the preceding in having few translucent 

 bands, about 6 in the cotype figured. It is somewhat heavier than 

 levis of equal size, and is a little more elevated. -No granulation is 

 now visible on the corroded surface. The columellar callus is heavy 

 and prominent. Alt. 15, diam. 17 mm., with nearly 5i whorls 

 {levis of the same diameter has f of a whorl less). Fossil. 



(3) The variety from San Geronimo Island (pi. XVI, figs. 49, 50, 

 coll. by H. N. Lowe) resembles crassula in contour and banding. 

 It is not quite so heavy, has a half whorl less, and is well enough 

 preserved to show traces of granulation on the spire in some examples. 

 It was found fossil. Specimens measure: 



Alt. I4i, diam. 16| mm.; 5 whorls. 



" 14 , " 15| " 5 



" 14 , " 14.8 " 5 " 



" " 18 " (broken). 



It appears that on these small, barren islets the levis stock has 

 deteriorated in size, often becoming more globose, and finally has died 

 out. The weak sculpture and usually small number of bands (in 

 comparison with Turtle Bay levis) are probably ancestral characters 

 preserved in these isolated colonies. So far as I know, these dimin- 

 ished races are extinct. The bands of these helices, brown or blackish 

 in life, become translucent gray in long dead or fossil specimens. 



(4) M. levis globosa n. subsp. PI. XVI, figs. 40, 47. The shell 

 is (jlohose-comc , higher than levis, with very little of the granulation 

 of that species, solid, glossy, multilineatc with l)rown on a white 

 ground, or sometimes bluish-white without bands. Columella strongly 

 toothed. Alt. 20.3, diam. 22.3 mm., oj whorls: or higher, alt. and 

 diam. 22 mm. Cerros Island, living. Probably Binney's two out- 

 side figures 311, in Land and Fresh-water Shells, I, p. 177, repre-sent 

 this race.

Helix areolata was described by Pfeiffer from specimens brought

 In a later publication he adds " on the Columbia River in California. " 

 Several places visited by Hinds on the Sulphur along the coast allow 

 a wide range of choice for the type locality: San Quintin Bay, 

 Cerros Island (where no shells seem to have l^een collected by Hinds), 

 Turtle (Bartolome) Bay, and ]Magdalena Bay, where several days 

 were spent.

Reeve and Crosse have figured specimens of the tessellated Magda-

of them Ls fully mature. I think, therefore, that "Magdalena Bay" 

 should undoubtedly be taken as the type locality of H. areolata. 

 Further information is needed to determine the exact place in that 

 neighborhood where shells agreeing with Pfeiffer's figures 10-12 

 (my text-fig. 2) are found, whether on the mainland or on Margarita 

 Island. None of the shells l^efore me are exactly localized. They 

 bear the general locality "Magdalena Bay." It is evident from the 

 five lots seen that different colonies vary in size, elevation, and degree 

 of maculation.' Pfeiffer's type and the specimens received from 

 Sowerbj'' are more depressed than most other lots. 



The more northern localities cited for areolata by Dr. Cooper and 

 others pertain, I believe, to forms of the levis group, which is kno^^^l 

 to occur from Asuncion Island northward, a region where areolata 

 does not occur. The known areas of levis and areolata are separated 

 by a long reach of coast whence no land snails are known. The 

 Natividad Island specimen I dissected as areolata (1898) is a form of 

 veatchii. With the exception of var. exanimata Cooper, areolata is 

 not knowTi to occur elsewhere than about Magdalena Bay, where it 

 inhabits one of the dryest regioas in the world. 



The shell is opaque white, with ochre-brown bands broken into 

 square spots, very variable in number and arrangement, as shown 

 in the figures. In one lot, markings are absent, or mdistinct and 

 corneous. The embryonic whorl is grayish corneous or yellowish 

 corneous. The columella varies from simple to distinctly toothed. 

 The size varies.

A EEVISION OF THE SPECIES OF THE GENUS NEMOBIUS (ORTHOPTERA : 



GRYLLIDS:! FOUND IN NORTH AMERICA NORTH OF 



THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA. 



BY MORGAN HEBARD. 



The genus Xemohius is typical of the group Nemobiites, the other 

 genera of which are more or less aberrant. The group Nemobiites 

 stands at the head of the subfamily Gryllinse, which is the second 

 division of the family Gryllidae. 



All of the species of Nemohius are of small size and are rather 

 delicate in structure; their bodies are covered with long hairs. The 

 plasticity in certain species, the lack of characters in the male 

 genitalia and the great variability in size, wing length, and coloration, 

 all combine to make the study of the genus difficult. Added to this, 

 the many incorrect determinations and frequent synonyms have 

 caused the task of correcting the nomenclature to be unusually 

 complex. An effort is made in the present paper to afford sufficient 

 information for subsequent workers to be able satisfactorily to 

 determine material of either se.x, but it is certain that, especiallj' 

 in the males of some species, no single specific character can be 

 considered absolutely trustworthy, and careful consideration of all 

 the specific differences must be made before a safe conclusion can be 

 reached. The large series of different species before us show con- 

 clusivelj- that, where some character may be safely relied upon in a 

 large series of the same species from one region, that character is 

 often obscure or unreliable in series from other portions of the insects 

 range and in con-sequence can only be used to supplement the com- 

 bination of characters found in that species.

Generic Description. — Size small; form compact; body pubescent 

 and sparsely clothed with long chsetiform hairs. Head rounded, 

 a little flattened in front; interantennal protuberance feelile, obtuse 

 and rather large; eyes oval, rather protuberant; ma.xillary palpi 

 with distal extremity of terminal joint verj- moderately oblique. 

 Pronotum a little wider eephalad than the head; lateral lobes with 

 ventral margin horizontal, the ventro-cephalic and ventro-caudal 

 angles projecting about the same and similarly roimded. Tegmina 

 complete or abbreviate; in the male furnished with a rather simple 

 tambourine, having only a single ulnar (obliciue) vein which is longitud- 

 inal, lengthened, developing from the angle of the stridulating (anal) 

 vein; in the female the dorsal field is furnished with few but promi- 

 nent longitudinal veins connected by transverse veinlets which are 

 directed at right angles to the veins; the tegmina are always present 

 in the North American species and are rounded at the apex; lateral 

 field of tegmina occupied by five or sbc simple veins which are free 

 from their bases. Wings strongly developed, abbreviate or absent. 

 Ovipositor slender, long and straight, or shorter and very gently 

 arcuate; apex very little enlarged, in all of the North American 

 species the portion formed bj' the dor.sal valves is armed with serra- 

 tions or serrulations, the portion formed l)y the ventral valves is 

 unarmed or supplied with minute, very widely spaced .serrulations. 

 Cerci of both sexes moderately long, tapering, and covered with 

 hairs. Cephalic tibiae supplied with a few long slender hairs, caudal 

 face only bearing a di.stinct tympanum, corresponding portion of 

 cephalic face slightly swollen. Caudal femora greatly dilated; 

 caudal tibia> with dorsal margin armed with a double row of extremely 

 long, widely spaced, mobile spines (in the North American species, 




396 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JunC, 



four pairs are present on each tibia), and armed distad with three 

 pairs of well developed spurs, the dorso-internal longer than any of 

 the other distal spurs. Caudal metatarsus non-sulcate and unarmed 

 dorsad, the distal extremity armed on both sides with long spines, 

 of which the internal is much the longer, and above these are situated 

 two minute teeth. 



Morphological Notes. — In the present genus the spines and spurs 

 of the caudal tibiae are extremely interesting. 



In the study of the North American species Mr. A. N. Caudell 

 first pointed out to the author a character in the distal spurs of the 

 caudal tibiae which proves to be absolutely constant and of the 

 greatest value. In four groups of North American species the internal 

 disto-ventral spur is much longer than the external disto-ventral 

 spur, in the remaining group these spurs are exactly equal in length. 



In the males of all of the North American species the proximo- 

 internal spine of the caudal tibia is highly specialized in structure. 

 It differs from the other spines in being very short, large at the base, 

 irregularly conical, suddenly attenuate and soft to the immediate 

 apex which is sharply pointed. The enlarged base is hard, of dark 

 color and polished, the soft portion is light in color and somewhat 

 translucent, while the immediate apex is hard and rather dark in 

 color. Frequently the hard apex is missing, and in such cases there 

 is every indication that it has been broken off. Pantel' has carefully 

 discussed this peculiar specialization in his interesting morphological 

 studies in the present genus, and it has been casually noted in certain 

 species by other authors.^ 



We find other interesting characters in the si)in('s of the caudal 

 tibiae of the North American species of the genus. In all of the 

 species having the disto-ventral spurs unequal in length the spines 

 (with the exception of the proximo-internal spine in the males, 

 which we have discussed above) are above rounded and hairy, below 

 concave with the margins of this sulcation minutely serrulate. In 

 all of the species having the disto-ventral spurs equal in length, the 

 disto-internal spine in the males is somewhat swollen near its base 

 and its shaft is appreciably bent; the other spines (likewise with 

 the exception of the proximo-internal spine in the males) are above 

 rounded and hairy, below concave, but with the margins of this 

 sulcation smooth. The apices of all of the spurs and spines of the

caudal tibiae are uncinate; smooth, sharp, and hard. Pantel has 

 also discussed the peculiarities of the distal (or fourth) internal spine 

 of the caudal tibia in his paper, where he has also given an excellent 

 figure of the spines and spurs of the caudal tibia in the male and 

 female of Nemobius Uneolatus Brulle. 



In the species having the disto-ventral spurs equal in length, the 

 internal dorsal and median spurs have lateral fringes of hairs on these 

 spurs more prominent and regular than in the other species. 



Cotnparison with Other Genera. — When compared with the genus 

 to which it is most nearly related, Paranemobius Saussure. we find 

 that Nemobius can be easily separated by the following characters: 

 the lateral lobes of the pronotum are quadrate, not oblique; the 

 tegmina of the male are provided with a t^'mpanum; the vertex is 

 slightly convex, not excavate and rostrate; the caudal tibiae are each 

 armed with six, not five, distal spurs. The genus of next nearest 

 relationship is Caconemobius Kirby, which differs in the lateral lobes 

 of the pronotum which are not quadrate, the organs of flight which 

 are absent and the cephalic tibiae which have no tympanum. From 

 the other more nearly related genera, Xemobius may be readily 

 separated by the characters found in the caudal tibiie which are 

 armed with long, mobile, pilose spines and in the caudal metatarsi 

 which are neither sulcata nor serrate dorsad. 



Distribution of the Genus in Xorth America. — The northern boundary 

 of the range of the genus is kno^\^l to extend from Prince E<.lwar<l 

 Island westward across Canada to Calgary, Alberta; from the latter 

 locality it has been found southward in the Yellowstone National 

 Park and the Salt Lake Valley in Utah, these localities showing its 

 extreme western distribution until southern Utah is reached, in which 

 latitude it has been taken at St. George, Utah, Las Vegas, Xev., and 

 the Panamint Valley in California to the Pacific coast at Los Ang(>les. 

 The genus is apparently found everywhere else in the United States 

 and Mexico south to the Isthmus of Panama, although the very few 

 records from southern Mexico, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica may 

 possibly indicate that in these southern regions the genus is very 

 scarce. In the West Indies the genus has been taken in the Bahamas, 

 Cuba, and Granada. 



We consider the northern distribution of the genus in the Dominion 

 of Canada probably limited by the spruce belt only, but so little 

 work has been done so far north that nothing definite can at present 

 be stated. No specimens have been taken in Arkansas, (Jklahonia, 




1913.] XATl'RAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 399 



and on the majority of the West Indian islands, but careful work 

 will show that the genus is well distributed in these regions with 

 .scarcely any doubt. Xo material is known from Yucatan, Honduras, 

 Salvador and Panama, where the genus will almost certainly be 

 found, though very possibly in few numbers. 



History. — The important references to the genus which apply to 

 the North American species have already been given. 



Walker described the genus Argizala in 1869,^ which genus is 

 monotjTjic and was synonymized by Saussure in 1877^ under Xemo- 

 hius. We consider Argizala to be a valid subgenus, distinguished 

 from the subgenus Allonemobius by the very large size, peculiar 

 glossiness, much more tran.sverse pronotmn, longer .spines of the 

 caudal tibia and ovipositor with apex armed above with serrulations. 

 This subgenus will probably be found to belong chiefly to the South 

 American fauna when the species of the present genus from that 

 continent have been carefuUj' studied. Xemobius brasiliensis, the 

 genotj'pe, is the only species of this subgenus known from North 

 America. 



The following North American species have been wrongly referred 

 to the genus Nemohius. 



In 1842, De Haan in Temminck-' recorded two species of the genus 

 Anaxipha as Gryllus (Xemobius) puiicurius and pumilus; this caused 

 Walker to refer the first of these .species with a query to Xemobius 

 in 1869.6 



Scudder described Xemobius circumcinctus in 1868,' which name 

 was used by Walker,* Thomas," and Saussure'" until 1896, when the 

 species was correctly synonymized as Prothacustes mexieaiia Saussure 

 by the original author of the .synonjTn." 



In 1896,'- Scudder described two species of Gryllidae as Xemobius 

 distinguendus and ensifer, and later in the same year'^ two more 

 species as Xemobius pictus and delicatus. All four of these species 

 unquestionablj- belong^ to the genus Miogryllus, as our examination 

 of the types show. Saussure in the next year'* followed Scudder

when quoting the latter's records of distinguendus and ensifer. In 

 1906,'* Kirby followed Scudder in quoting pictus as a Nemobius, but 

 two years later Rehn and Hebard'" correctly quoted the species for 

 the first time as a Miogryllus. 



Kirby also gives Nemobius exiguus Say in his list,'' though that 

 species has long been known to belong to the genus Anaxipha. 



Examination of the types shows that Nemobius alleni Morse/* 

 belongs to a different genus. 



An exotic species has been recorded as a North American species 

 but once. In 1906, Caudell'^ recorded as Xemobius fasciatus from 

 Sapucay, Paraguay, specimens of the South American species 

 Nemobius rufus. 



The following records cannot be determined without examination 

 of the material. 



Theresa of Bavaria's-" record of Nemobius exiguus from Brazo de 

 Loba, Lower Magdalena River, Colombia, South America, and 

 Woodworth's-' records of Ne7nobius mexicanus and tieomexicanus 

 from California. 



We have omitted Nemobius triniiatis Scudder, owing to the fact 

 that until additional material from Trinidad is secured little definite 

 can be said of this insect. The type series is in bad condition, and 

 we feel justified in stating only that the specimens belong to the 

 subgenus Eunemobius and may prove to be an insular race of Nemobius 

 caroliiius. Though the type series are all from the South American 

 fauna, the specimens recorded by Brunner- as Nemobi>ts cubensis 

 from Balthazar, Ciranada, have been examined and found to belong 

 probably to this insect.

The present key is of necessity somewhat involved owing to the 

 difficulties found in the present genus and commented upon at the 

 beginning of this paper. 



In some species it may be seen that certain characters, which are 

 of little or no value in the majority of species, are of great importance. 

 The color pattern of the head is distinctive in Xemobius maculatus, 

 ambitiosus, griseus and griseus funeralis. The coloration of the 

 maxillary palpi is distinctive in Xemobius carolinus and its races and 

 particularl}' so in confusus. 



Certain important differences exist in the North American species 

 of the genus which are of .sufficient value to warrant the erection of 

 four subgenera and the recognition of Walker's Argizala as another 

 subgenus. A study of all the species of Xemobius of the world would 

 probably show the advisability of considering some of these groups 

 separate genera, while many other groups not found in North America 

 would constitute still other genera and subgenera. 



The genotype of Xemobius is Xemobius sijlvestris of Europe, which 

 species belongs to a group differing very widely from any of those 

 here treated in the following combination of characters. Spines of 

 caudal tibia unmodified in both sexes, disto-ventral spurs of same 

 unequal, but not nearly as much so as in the North .\merican species 

 having this character. Ovipositor longer than caudal fenUir, nearly 

 rigidly straight; apex very narrowly sublanceolate and wholly 

 unarmed. Color pattern of head distinctive. Xemobius sylvestris 

 bears a superficial resemblance to Xemobius ambitiosus. 



Examination of other exotic species shows that the genus .\emobius 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHIL.'UJELPHIA. 405 



is divided into numerous natural groups everywhere in its distribution 

 as in North America. 



A number of species treated in the present paper are found in Ijoth 

 brachjTJterous and macropterous forms, while others are known from 

 brachj-pterous or macropterous individuals only. These facts have 

 been treated under the Biological Notes for each species, as habit 

 and environment appear to have been chiefly instrumental in such 

 development. These differences are almost wholly without value as 

 specific characters, and, since they have been frequently so u.sed^ 

 have given rise to much confusion in the past literature. 



Subgenus ALLOXEMOBIUS n. subgen. 



The subgenus includes four species and three geographic races 

 from North America. Type of Subgenus^.Ve??io6iws fasciatus 

 [Gryllus fasciatus] (De Geer). 



Subgeneric Description. — Size large to small for the genus. Disto- 

 ventral spurs of caudal tibia very unequal in length. Proximo- 

 internal spine of caudal tibia in male specialized as described under 

 Morphological Notes for the genus; other spines of caudal tibia 

 below concave, with margins of this sulcation minutely serrulate in 

 both sexes, the disto-internal spine not specialized. Ovipositor long 

 and nearly rigidly straight; apex with margin of portion formed by 

 dorsal valves obliquely subtruncate and armed with teeth, the 

 portion formed by ventral valves unarmed.

The present species finds its nearest relatives in .V. mactilattis antl 

 .V. griseus. From macvlatus, typical fasciatiis may he separated hy 

 its larger size, more uniform general coloration, striped occiput,

longer and less decidedly truncate tegmina in both sexes and in the 

 female by the teeth of the dorsal margin of the apex of the ovipositor, 

 which in fasciatus are rather prominent but not very sharp, while in 

 maculatus these, teeth are as prominent and very sharp. The ovi- 

 positor in tj'pical /asci'a^MS is also longer and not so rigidly straight. 



From griseus the present species may be readily distinguished by 

 its more robust proportions in even the smallest race, .V. fasciatus 

 abortivus, the different general coloration, and also in characters of 

 the ovipositor which in griseus are much as in maculatus. lu fasciatus 

 the lower face is never darker than the interocular portion of the 

 same, while in griseus the lower face is strikingly darker than the 

 other portions of the head. 



Certain individuals of this plastic species approach maculatus 

 closely in general appearance, and those before us from Tobermory, 

 Ont., Mount Pleasant, N. J., and Sulphur Springs, X. C, recorded, 

 respectively, by E. j\I. AA^alker, Rehn, and Rehn and Hebard as 

 that species, do indeed bear it a close resemblance. There are 

 a number of other specunens in the present series likewise 

 differing from typical fasciatus in being small, highly colored and 

 more or less tawny, from numerous localities extending from New 

 Jersey to North Carolina. No specimens in this series, however, 

 have the peculiar color pattern of maculatus, nor the compact struc- 

 ture and tegminal outline of that species. From the form here 

 discussed to typical fasciatus, every gradation may be found in the 

 material before us. 



The series of specimens from Thompson's Mills, Ga., recorded by 

 Allard as X. canus bear a resemblance to the aberrant individuals 

 discussed above, but are considerably larger and still more highly 

 colored as described in the color notes on the following page. These 

 specimens in consequence have a general fasces very different from 

 that of tjpical fasciatus.

 width, narrowing slightly in the cephalic portion. Tegniina nearly 

 as long as the caudal femora, apex of same dorsal in position, distal 

 margin of dorsal field rotundato-rectangulate, longitudinal veins 

 rather conspicuous, cross-veinlets faint. Wings very long, twice as 

 long as tegmina. Supra-anal plate very short and strongly 

 transverse, sharply and suddenly depressed mesad, the caudal 

 margin almost straight but slightly produced mesad, separated 

 by a pronounced transverse fold from the supra-anal plate, which 

 plate is shield-shaped. Cerci long, evenly tapering, thickly 

 covered with hairs. Ovipositor very long, longer than caudal 

 femora, rigid, with a scarcely perceptible arcuation, apex of same

 (meso-cephalic) width contained about three times in length. 



A male bearing the same data as the female here descriljed affords 

 the additional characters given below. 



Size very .slightly smaller, proportions much as in female. The 

 tegmina are translucent and when in repose the dorsal fields are 

 hemi-elliptical in outline. Subgenital plate scoop-shaped, narrowing 

 evenly but considerably caudad. The proximo-internal spine of the 

 caudal tibia specialized as described under Morphological A'o/pv in the 

 generic discussion of the present paper. 



The brachypterous form of the present species differs in having the 

 apex of the female tegmina at the humeral angle, the distal margin 

 of the dorsal field roundly obliciue, arcuato-truncate, while the sutural 

 margin passes into the distal margin without angulation.

 from the present type to one similar to that of macHlalu.i.

longer than the caudal femur and seldom under seven millimeters 

 in length. The southern geographic race, fasciatus socius, has the 

 ovipositor as short as or shorter than the caudal femur with scarcely 

 an exception, while the northern prairie race, fasciatus abortivus, is 

 distinguished from fasciatus by the usually shorter and differently 

 shaped ovipositor and almost invariably shorter caudal femur. The 

 letters indicating the distribution of fasciatus sociiis are S to c, while 

 those of fasciatus abortii'us are A to D. 



Color Notes. — The specimens here descril^ed are typical in coloration 

 of the majority of specimens of the species found about Philadelphia. 

 General color of head and pronotum clove brown shading to very 

 dark mummy brown on the abdomen, lunbs, and exposed portions of 

 the wings. Head with occiput very obscurely striped with four 

 longitudinal lines which are very slightly lighter than the rest of the 

 occiput, eyes very dark mummy brown. Maxillary palpi mummy 

 browii, the terminal segment darker. Tegmina of male translucent 

 mummy brown, in the almost transparent portions shading to Ijurnt 

 umber, discoidal vein ivory white, this marking being so narrow as 

 to be inconspicuous; of female prouts brown, the longitudinal veins 

 Vandyke brown and the proximal portion of the intermediate channel 

 Vandyke brown. The postocular portion of the gensB and ventral 

 margin of the lateral lobes of the pronotum are yellowish, these 

 yellowish markings very obscure. Ovipositor very dark vandykc 

 lirown. 



A few individuals from the same region are to be found of lighter 

 coloration and in these the color pattern of the species is much more 

 pronounced. In such the dorsal portion of the head, the eyes, and 

 dorsum of the pronotum are prouts brown, the occipital stripes are 

 distinct, while the interantennal protuberance is pale Ijurnt umbin- 

 shading to russet on the mouth parts. The last joint of the maxillary 

 palpi is russet in the.se specimens for the proximal third, shading in 

 the remaining portion to verj- dark brown. The upper i^ortion of the 

 lateral lobes of the pronotum is very dark brown, while the ventral 

 margin of the same is prouts brown. The limbs and ventral surface 

 of the abdomen are russet. This russet shade is frequently found to 

 extend to the dorsal surface of the abdomen in such specimens of 

 light coloration, when this is not the case that portion of the abdomen 

 i.s clove brown. 



Interesting differences in coloration of series of the present species 

 are found over its entire range of distribution, the more important 

 of which are here considered. A series of large pale individuals from 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 415 " 



Dallas, Tex., is before us, upon which Scudder based his .Y. canus; 

 these .specimens belong to the race fasciatus sociits, while .specimens 

 from places in the region where fasciatus and fasciatus socius appar- 

 ently intergrade, Raleigh, N. C, and Crawford County, Ind., are 

 of the same light coloration but somewhat more slender. Sjiecimens 

 oi fasciatus proper from Long Island, N. Y., and Falls Church, Va., 

 are equallj- pale, being russet in general coloration, but none are as 

 robust as the individuals from Dallas, Tex. In all of these specimens 

 as well as in a somewhat darker but very brilliantly colored series 

 from Thompson's ]\Iills, Ga., the males have the coloration of the 

 discoidal vein more pronounced, while the area Ijetween this and the 

 free veins of the lateral field is seal brown proximad and of that 

 coloration to the end of the tegmen between the discoidal and medi- 

 astine veins. It is interesting to note that in such pale specimens of 

 the present species as well as in those of very dark coloration the 

 longitudinal stripes of the occiput are absent, while these stripes 

 become more and more pronounced between the extremes of light 

 and dark coloration until in the absolute intermediates-^ they are 

 usually well defined. 



Very dark individuals of fasciatus proper are to be found in almost 

 every series, but this is much more pronounced in individuals from 

 the more northern points of the species' distribution. In the material 

 before us this is very noticeable in a series from Oxford, ]Mass., which 

 are for the greater part small in size and very dark. In the.se speci- 

 mens the light portion of the lateral lobes is much reduced and ob- 

 scured while in the darkest specimens of the series it is absent, the 

 yellowish coloration of the discoidal vein is scarcely perceptible to 

 the naked eye. The few lighter specimens in this series, however, 

 have the occipital stripes more pronounced than in any other speci- 

 mens of the species before us. 



Every conceivable intergradation between the extremes of the 

 species is to be found in the present series not only in coloration, but 

 also in size and in length of tegmina, wings, caudal femur, and ovi- 

 positor. 



Distribution. — Typical fasciatus is to be found from Prince Edward 

 Island across the Dominion of Canada westward to the prairie region 

 in Manitoba, where its place is occupied by fasciatus abortivus. 

 South of this country that geographic race gives place again to 



" The intermediates here referred to are u.suaUy few in number, as by far the 

 majoritj- of individuals of the species approach the dark extremes more or less 

 closely. 




416 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JuilC, 



fasciatus proper in northern North Dakota and Montana, and true 

 fasciatus is to be found as far west as the Yellowstone National Park 

 in Wyoming, to the base of the Rockies in Colorado, and a few 

 specimens have been taken at Spring Lake, Utah. Its southern 

 limits are marked by the fall line in the southeastern United States, 

 and west of the Appalachians it is found as far south as Tennessee, 

 Arkansas, Oklahoma, and, without doubt, the Panhandle of Texas, 

 to Roswell and Albuquerque, N. Mex. South of this as far west as 

 the dry country of Texas, fasciatus is supplanted b.y the geographic 

 race, fasciatus socius. 



Biological Xotcs. — The present species is one of the most abundant 

 of the North American Gryllidfe and is often found in great numbers 

 over the greater part of its range. It flourishes not only in grassy 

 uplands, but also in meadows and in the heavy grasses about marshes 

 and swamps. It is also frequent along the borders of woodlands 

 and is to be met with in open forests where the ground is somewhat 

 grassy. It is particularly noticeable in areas of lush grasses about 

 damp places in the northernmost portions of its range, where, as has 

 been found in almost all insect life of the north, as numerous species 

 disappear, those remaining and having a more northerly distribution 

 are found in enormous numbers. The present species does not 

 flourish under arid conditions, but its distribution is often extended 

 into the arid west in many places where river bottoms and other 

 watered spots afford a green vegetation well suited to this insect. 



The majority of specimens seen of fasciatus are brachypterous, al- 

 though at times macroptcrous individuals appear in countless num- 

 bers, and are then conspicuous, jiarticularly atiout the lights at night. 

 The writer has seen one flight which occurreil in the fall of 1911 at 

 Chestnut Hill, Phila., when, shortly after nightfall, the ground under 

 the arc lights in that portion of Philadelphia swarmed with these 

 crickets, although usually few if any specimens are to be found at 

 that place attract(>d to light. 



The song of the insect is shrill and ha< been described a^; "tiiii-

 "crcee-creee-crece-creec" b.\ Kdui and Ilebard. Piers .states that 

 "the stridulation is produced by lifting the wing covers about forty- 

 five degrees above the al)domen and then sliudiing them together, 

 producing a sound resembling the word |)lee-c-e-(' plec-c-e-e plee-e-e-e 

 or cree-e-e-e. " 



Morphological Xoles. — An interesting variation in size is found in 

 the present species. It appears that the insect decreases in size

northward from the centre of its distribution, but that occasional 

 series of unusuallj' small size are sometimes found in the central 

 portion of its range. These smaller series would seem at first glance 

 to belong.to a different species, but close examination fails to disclose 

 valid characters of any sort, which is also true of the occasional light 

 colored specimens which have from time to time been referred to 

 caiius. 



Synonymy. — The synonymy of the present species is much involved 

 owing to the fact that it is one of the oldest recognized species of 

 North American Orthoptera as well as one of the most abundant and 

 variable over the greater portion of its range. 



In 1775, Fabricius described Acheta hospes from America, this 

 being a synonym based on the macropterous form oi fasciatus. 



Harris-^", in 1841, described the brachypterous form of the present 

 species as Acheta vitiata, which name since that time has been exten- 

 sively used to designate the brachypterous form of the insect. 



Scudder, in 1862, mo.st unfortunately recorded macropterous 

 specimens of the present species as N{emobius) exigims, confusing 

 Sa3''s Acheta exigua with fasciatus, which former species belongs to 

 the genus Anaxipha. This mistake was repeated by Glover in 1872, 

 and the introduction of that name in the nomenclature of the genus 

 Nemobius resulted in the greatest confusion in the work of many 

 subseciuent authors. 



In 1896, Scudder described Nemobius utahensis, the type of which'" 

 cannot be distinguished from the brachypterous form of fasciatus, 

 while since that time specimens of the present species have been 

 referred by various authors to Nemobius utahensis, canu^^, niaculatus, 

 cubensis, palustris, and carolinusP 



Specimens Examined}* — 641: 273 males, 353 females, and 15 

 nymphs. 



'" In 183.") Harris incluilcd in liis list of Massachusotts inscds Say's manuscript 

 name Aclnl<i simlis hascil on tlic inac-ro])tcr(ius form of ,/Vi.«('/^/.s', liut, as there 

 was no accoinpanyinn cle.srriplion, tliat iiarni' falls as a noincn nmliiin. 



" We here select as .single type a female specimen, taken at, Siiring Lake, Utah, 

 in July, 1875, and now in the United States National Museum. 



'-See discussion of this name under the Synonymy of Nemobius fasciatus 

 socius. 



" The only other name probably applicable to the pre.sent species is Nemobius 

 marginata of MurtfeKlt, published in 1893 witliout description, hence a nomen 

 nudum. 



"The following abbreviations are used to differentiate the specimens here 

 recorded: Lg., large size; med., medium size; sm., .small .size; b., brachyp- 

 terous; m., macropterous; pi., pale in coloration; dk., dark in coloration; br.,

Tlii.-5 geograijliie race can be distinguished from tyi)ical fasciatus 

 solely by the proportions of the caudal femur and ovipositor; over its 

 entire range there is an increase in the robustness of the caudal femur 

 and in the female a decrease in the length of the ovipositor, which, wlien 

 compared in length with the caudal femur, is found to be as short as 

 or shorter than that member. So few exceptions are to be found to 

 this that, in spite of the close affinity of these southern individuals 

 to fdsciatus in all other respects, they should certainly be considered 

 to belong to a definite geographic race. 



Type: 9 ; Georgia. [Scudder Collection.) 



Descriplion of Type. — Agrees perfectly witli tyjjical fasciatus, 

 except that the caudal femora are pri)]K)rtionately longer and heavier 

 and the ovipositor shorter, in consequence the length of the caudal 

 femur is equal to that of the ovipositor. 



Males from the same State as the type do not dilTcr fnun males of 

 fasciatus except in their more robust cautlal femora, and so great is

The series from Thomasville, Ga., is typical of fa^atus socius and 

 shows the considerable variability in size found in a series of this 

 geographic race from a single locality. The specimens from Dallas, 

 Tex., average larger than any series before us from east of the Appala- 

 chians, but the male specimen from Bronson, Fla., anil the female 

 from Bainbridge, Ga., show that the largest individuals from the east 

 considerably exceed in size those from Dallas, Tex. The majority 

 of specimens before us from Raleigh, N. C, are of average size, but 

 the series contains some of the smallest specimens of fasciatus socius 

 before us, and the measurements of these are given above to show that 

 extreme of the race. 



Color Xotes. — Specimens from the south Atlantic and Gulf coasts 

 which were taken in damp or marshy situations are without exception 

 very dark brown in coloration. Those from the undergrowth of the 

 pine woods in the south Atlantic States are frequently cinnamon or 

 russet in general coloration, while some of the males taken under such 

 conditions ha\ e the markings of typical fasciatus very conspicuous. 

 Individuals taken at various places in the semi-dry interior of Texas 

 are quite as pale as these, but are not so tawny and the males do not 

 have the darker markings .so well defined and conspicuous. As in 

 fasciatus, the occipital l)ars are absent in all very light or very dark 

 specimens while most consjiicuous in those which are slightly lighter 

 than the average. 



Distribiition. — This geogra])iiic race is found over the southeastern 

 United States, the northern limit of distribution l>eing ilefiiied by the 

 fall line. West of the .\p])alachians it is found from the Gulf of 

 Mexico northward to Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. These 

 northern limits marking the line of intergradation into typical 

 fasciatus. The nio.st western localities at which fasciatus socius has 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 425 



been taken are Victoria, Sarita, and Brownsville, Tex., and Mexico 

 City. 



Biological Xotes. — Though often found in large numbers, this 

 geographic race is seldom met with in the myriads in which true 

 fasciatus is so frequently found. In southern Georgia and along the 

 Gulf coast the insect is to be found adult at all seasons except during 

 the coldest portions of January, February, and March, while in 

 southern Florida it is found mature throughout the entire year. 



The series before us indicates that more macropterous individuals 

 are met with in this geographic race than in typical fasciatus. 



Morphological Xotes. — The variability of the present species is 

 nowhere more striking than in series of fasciatus socius from various 

 localities. Very light individuals are to be found and others with 

 heads or tegmina of unusual size and .shape. The specimens from 

 Dallas, Tex., upon which Scudder based ^V. canus, are very pale, 

 though but little tinged with russet, and have abnormatly large 

 heads. There are many specimens before us which show the un- 

 questionable intergradation from the various series to typical fasciatus 

 socius and also from one series to the other. 



Synonymy. — In 1896 Scudder described Nemobius canus from a 

 series of six males and ten females of which we here select a male 

 from Dallas, Tex. (Boll.) [Scudder Collection], as the type. We 

 unhesitatingly place this species in the synonymy under fasciatus 

 socius, from which geographic race it can in no way be separated; the 

 specimens upon which it was based, including the type here selected, 

 are large and rather pale individuals of fasciatus socius. In his 

 original description Scudder states that it is possibly only a geographic 

 race of fa-^ciatus, remarkable for its cinereous aspect and the striped 

 appearance of the female tegmina. The series before us show that 

 the cinereous aspect is found in pale specimens of both fasciatus and 

 fasciatus socius in varying degrees over their entire range, and the 

 different appearance of the tegmina is solely due to the fact that in 

 light specimens of the present species the dark markings are often 

 conspicuous. 



In the same paper in which Scudder (U'scribiMl .V. canus, he also 

 described \. aterrimus. This is a most unfortunate result of carele.s.s- 

 ness, for the unique male, which we here select as the type of aterri- 

 mus, is a medium-sized, dark, brachypterous specimen of fasciatus 

 socius, while the unicjue female belongs to .V. cubensis. A thoroughly 

 brief and unsatisfactory description based on two specimens of dif- 

 ferent species can hardly have been expected to do other than mislead 

 when opportunity was lacking to examine the types. 




426 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



Saus.sure, in 1897, described Xeniobius hastatus, liasing that species 

 on a single female from Mexico City.^" Careful examination of this 

 type proves it to be a synonym of the present geographic race of 

 fasciatiis. The specimen is of exceptionally small size, but Saussure's 

 error was caused by his misconception of De Geer's fasciatus in the 

 same paper, for the specimens which he there regards as that species 

 belong in fact to the very different brasiliensis of Walker, and conse- 

 quently he looked upon the specimen under consideration as new.

Individuals of the present geographic race of N . fasciatutt are found 

 to differ from typical specimens of the species in their much smaller 

 size, very dark coloration, extreme abbreviation of the tegmina, and, 

 in the female, by differences in the ovipositor, the apex of which is 

 fully as nmch enlarged but for a less distance than in fasciatus, being 

 more obliquely subtruncate, and is provided with more pronounced 

 teeth. 



"All belong to the type series of the synonymous Xemobius cnnus Scudder, 

 with the exception of the macropterous specimen, which is labelled .V. socius by 



Scudder. 




428 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



Though resembhng X. macidatus closely in size and somewhat in 

 form, imlividuals of this race may be separated by the absence of light 

 markings on the head, immaculate and dark coloration, less sharply 

 truncate tegmina in both sexes, more shinj' appearance in the males, 

 and different apex of the ovipositor in the females. 



Type: d^ ; Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. In grass along borders of 

 draw on prairie. August 24, 1903. (Caudell) [U. S. N. M. Collection.] 



Description of Type. — Size smallest of the races of fasciatits, 

 similar to .V. macidatus in size, but form not quite so robu.st. Head, 

 ej'es, and pronotum as mfasciatus. Tegmina not as long as the caudal 

 femur, translucent and rather abruptly rounded distad, though not as 

 sharply truncate as in typical macidatus. Wings absent. Abdominal 

 appendages and first proximal internal spine of caudal tibiae as in 

 fa.^ciaius. Limbs as in fasciaius. 



Allotypic 9 , here selected, bears the same data as the type. 



Description of Allotype. — Size larger, but proportions much as in 

 the type. Tegmina much shorter than the caudal femur, broadly 

 rounded distad, though not as much so as in typical macidatus, 

 longitudinal veins rather conspicuous, cross veinlets faint. Wings 

 ab.sent. Ovipositor long, longer than caudal femur, rigid, with a 

 .scarcely perceptible arcuation, apex of same sublanceolate, enlarged 

 for a shorter distance than in fasciatiis and more obliquely subtrun- 

 cate than in that species, with that portion formed by the dorsal 

 valves armed, the upi)er margin dentate, these teetli rather irregular, 

 heavj', and sharply cut.

this race averages considerablj- less, while the length of the ovipositor 

 is also less in the majority of cases. 



The small dark form of fasciatus found in eastern Ontario and 

 Michigan, of which Walker speaks,^" is, as he has stated, but a 

 degenerate and does not, as Caudell has supposed,'"' belong to the 

 present geographic race. From this it may be separated by the 

 general coloration, which although dark, is not as nearly black as in 

 fasciatus abertinis, and the ovipositor which is exactl}' as in fasciatus. 

 Intermediates between such individuals and fasciatus abortivus will 

 undoubtedly be found frequently' in the area of intergradation be- 

 tween fasciatus and the present geographic race. The individuals 

 from Aweme, Man., before us, do not show the characters which 

 define the geographic race as distinctly as do the specimens from the 

 type locality, all of the other specimens here treated are typical. 



Color Notes. — The males of the present geographic race appear to 

 be shiny black to the naked eye, but under a Zeiss binocular are 

 found to be shiny dark clove brown in general coloration. The 

 maxillary palpi are darker than in typical fasciatus. The yellow 

 line of the discoidal vein of the males is extremely narrow, and the 

 yellowish markings of the postocular portion of the gense and 

 ventral margin of the lateral lobes are absent or very greatly reduced 

 and obscured in both sexes. The tegmina of the females have the 

 dorsal field sepia in general color with the longitudinal veins tinged 

 with tawny and the median vein distinctly outlined in clove brown, 

 which is also the color of the entire lateral field with the exception 

 of the intermediate channel which is of the same color as the dorsal 

 field. Several of the females of fasciatus abortivus before us have a 

 general coloration which is somewhat less dark, and in these specimens 

 the dorsal surface of the insect approaches sepia with a faint tawnj'' 

 cast and in one or two individuals the pale stripes of the occiput are 

 faintly indicated. 



Distribution. — This geographic race is found over the prairie region 

 of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta in the Dominion of Canada, 

 and in the adjacent portions of the United States. It has also been 

 taken as far ea.st as Fort William, in extreme western Ontario. 



Biological Notes. — Caudell has found this race plentiful in the grass 

 along the borders of a draw on the prairie at Moose .Jaw, Sask., 

 while Walker states that it is common cver.vwhere on the 

 prairies of Manitoba, Sa.skatchewan, and Alberta. The latter author

The long straight ovipositor of the present species having the dorsal 

 margin of its apex obliquely subtruncate and armed with teeth 

 places it at once in the first of the North American suligenera, 

 AUonemobius, of which fasciaius is the type. 



From typical X . fasciatus it is possible to distinguish maculatus by 

 its smaller size and more compact structure, the different markings 

 on the head and maxillary palpi and more mottled general color 

 pattern, the short tegmina which arc more quatlrate in the male and 

 more nearly squarely truncate in the female, and the shorter more 

 rigid ovipositor which is armed with very sharp teeth. 



From .V. griseus it may be distinguished by all the characters 

 which .separate that species from all other species of the subgenus. 



A general superficial resemblance to .V. amhitiosus is noticeable, 

 but examination at once reveals the many differential characters of 

 that aberrant species. 



Described from one male and nii'c females from two localities.

As in other characters, there is very much less variation in the 

 size and projiortions of the present species than in fasciatus. In the 

 entire series before us there are no specimens noticeably larger or 

 smaller than those whose measurements are given above. 



Color \otcs. — The specimens here described are tyi)ical in colora- 

 tion of the great majority of specimens of the species before us. 

 General color bistre with a tawny suffusion, the dorsum of the 

 pronotum tlotted, and the caudal limbs mottled with darker brown. 

 Head with a narrow pale yellowish line about the eyes e.\ce])t on the 

 infra-ocular portion of the genie, a medio-longitudinal line of the 

 same color faintly indicated on the occiput. Maxillary palpi, of

russet.'" Lateral lobes of pronotura broadlj- barred with clove 

 brown, the immediate ventral margin of the general coloration of the 

 insect. Tegmina with dorsal field of male translucent bistre, with 

 discoidal vein narrowly outlined in ivory white; dorsal field of female 

 bistre with a tawTiy suffusion, the median vein pale j'ellowish; lateral 

 field in l)oth sexes clove brown. Ovipositor very dark vandyke 

 brown. 



As has been noted, the males are usually darker than the females 

 and in consequence have the abdomen wholly clove bromi, while 

 in the females this portion of the body is usually bistre, more or less 

 suffused with tawny. In a few of the specunens of darkest coloration 

 the light markings on the head are, as would be expected, considerably 

 obscured. 



Distribution. — The present species is distributed over the Upper 

 Austral Zone of the eastern United States and has been taken from 

 Flatbush, L. I., N. Y., southward through New Jersey, Pennsj-lvania, 

 Maryland, and Virginia, as far as Raleigh, N. C, and westward 

 through Ohio and Indiana to Illinois. 



Biological Xotes. — This is a secretive species which is almost always 

 found among leaves and about logs in woods, particularity in damp 

 .situations. In such places colonies of considerable size are some- 

 times to be found, but unless special effort is made to locate these, 

 the little insects in most cases wholly escape the notice of the col- 

 lector. 



This is one of the species of Nemobius in which the reduction of the 

 tegmina has reached an advanced stage, and we are consequently 

 not surprised to find no macropterous individuals in the series of 

 .specimens before us. 



Synonymy. — Xo synonyms of the present species have been erected. 

 Specimens of the diminutive and peculiarly colored type of fasciatus 

 •discussed under that species have been referr(>d Ijy Walker on 

 Scudder's identification, and by Rehn and Hebard to the present 

 species. 



Specimens E.vamined. — 81: 27 males, 53 females, and 1 nymph.

" This difference of coloration is due to the fact that the female is Ughter than 

 the male, this is usually the ca.se in the present species. The series before us 

 indicates that, in maculalun as in fanciatuH, tho linhtosl portion of the maxillary 

 palpi is the pro.ximal portion of the penultiiiiali; scKiniiit. In pale specimens 

 the light coloration extends from the apex of the segment which precedes the 

 penultimate to the base of the terminal segment.

The measurements of all the specimens before us of the present 

 species are given above, these indicate that there is considerable

 in coloration. General color, in pale specimens, hair brown; in 

 dark specimens, clove brown wa.shed with grayish. Head below the 

 antennse deep shining piceous, above of the general coloration with 

 two or sometimes three usually distinct, dark, narrow, longitudinal

penultimate segment the palest, terminal segment very dark. Dor- 

 sum of pronotum, dorsal surface of abdomen and of cautlal femora of 

 the general coloration, excepting that the fir-st segments of the 

 abdomen, concealed beneath the tegmina, are shining black, while 

 the exposed .segments have each a small dark median spot. Lateral 

 lobes of pronotum l)roadly banded with clove brown, the ventral 

 margin narrowly markeil with buff, which marking is, in the majority 

 of specimens, a mere line. Tegmina translucent; male with ilorsal 

 field of the general coloration, the discoidal vein narrowly outlined 

 in buff, lateral fields clove brown becoming iiale towartl the costal 

 margin; female with dorsal field broccoli brown, in some specimens 

 somewhat tinged with rufous, intermediate channel somewhat paler 

 with a black line on the dorsal margin Ijordering the meilian vein, 

 lateral field similar in coloration to the dorsal field with the exception 

 of a dark area Ijetween the humeral and mediastine veins, which in

pale specimens is seal brown and in dark specimens black. Ventral 

 sm^ace of body, caudal femora and sometimes other limbs wood 

 brown, more or less suffused with russet in the males, and all but the 

 median portion obscured with dark brown in one female. Cephalic 

 and median limbs and caudal tibiae clove brown maculate with a 

 paler shade. 



Distribution. — This insect is known from the type localities in the 

 central portion of eastern Ontario and from southwestern Indiana. 



Biological Xotes. — The insect has been found only on sandy soil 

 among scant vegetation. Dr. Walker tells us that its pale colors 

 render it very incoaspicuous against the sand. Thirty specunens of 

 the present species have now been recorded, of which but one is 

 macropterous. 



Synonymy. — Xo synonyms of the present species exist. Blatchlej', 

 however, was led to record specimens of this insect as A', ciibensis 

 in 1900 and 1903, owing to Scudder's incorrect determination. 



Specimens Examined. — 13: 7 males, 6 females.

The present interesting insect is very different from anj' of the 

 other species found in Texas, but, although known from the unique 

 type only, comparisons with the type and other .specimens of Walker's 

 A', griseus show without cjuestion that it is a geographic race of that 

 species differing only in the darker coloration, more obscure color 

 pattern and much shorter ovipositor. Material from the country 

 which intervenes between the type locality and the range of typical 

 ^n'sews will doubtless show intermediates much as those found between 

 .V. fasciatus and its southern race X. fa.^ciatus ."^ocins, although in the 

 present race the differentiation appears to have reached a more 

 advanced degree.

Color Notes. — The type is much darker than the series of N. griseus 

 before us, being in general coloration very dark clove brown (almost 

 black) washed with grayish, but the distinctive markings of that 

 insect are all present in this dark specimen although less prominent. 

 The portion of the head below the antenna is deep shining piceous, 

 exactly as in griseus, while the occipital stripes though faint are 

 clearly discernible under a Zeiss binocular. Eyes clove brown and 

 maxillary palpi of the same color, the distal portion of the third 

 segment and the entire penultimate segment somewhat paler. 

 Pronotum wholly of general coloration excepting in the cephalic 

 l)ortion which is somewhat paler, particularly so on the lateral lobes. 

 Tegmina with dorsal field broccoli Ijrown faintly tinged with rufous, 

 intermediate channel of same coloration with the black line of the 

 dorsal margin (often striking in griseus) very narrow; lateral fields 

 black. Femora and ventral surface of body black; other portions 

 of limbs bistre. 



Distribution. — The present in.sect is known only from College

This trim insect may be immediately distinguished from all other 



North American species of the genus by the very striking markings 



of the head and the usually distinctly sfl-iped caudal femora. IVIore- 



over, in the males, the evenness of the dorsal field of the tegmina, 



which is l:)ounded by a pale narrow line not onh' laterad, but caudad 



as well, gives this sex a very clean-cut appearance, while the scarcely

enlarged apical portion of the ovipositor in the opposite sex is dis- 

 tinctive. 



The insect is a verj- aberrant memlier of the subgenus Allonemobius. 

 Although a small amount of variation exists in size, proportions, and 

 tone of general coloration, the peculiarly striking color pattern is 

 constant in th<! present .species.

Size medium for the genus, form robust; head rather large and 

 rounded, but considerably flattened in front. Maxillary palpi much 

 as in X. griseus, but with the penultimate segment much more de- 

 cidedly constricted in the proximal portion. Eyes broad-ovate, not 

 at all protruding. Pronotum as in griseus. Tegmina less than half 

 as long as caudal femora, apex at humeral angle very broadly and 

 roundly obtuse-angulate, distal margin of dorsal field oblique, passing 

 into the sutural margin arcuately without angulation, the intermediate 

 channel not conspicuous and forming part of the dorsal field, longi- 

 tudinal veins very heavy and straight, cross-veinlets numerous but 

 very faint. Wings absent. Ovipositor slightly longer than the 

 caudal femora,'" rigidly straight, apex of same scarcely enlarged, 

 dorsal margin of apex armed with an even series of heavy, sharp 

 teeth. Subgenital plate scoop-shaped, shorter than in A^. fasciatus, 

 with caudal margin straight. Caudal femora with greatest width 

 (meso-cephalic) contained less than three times in the length. Spines 

 of caudal tibiie stiff, covered with very short hairs, margins very 

 finely serrate; caudal metatarsus furnished on dorsal and ventral 

 margins with unusually heavy bristles.

Although the variation in size and proportions is well demon- 

 strated by the above measurements, we find the species to vary but 

 little in its distinctive color pattern and tegniinal structure. Over 

 the distribution of ambitiosus there is no gradual increase or decrea.se 

 in size, local conditions governing such variation ; this is shown by 

 the extremes given for the series from Gainesville, Fla., which series 

 averages rather large, but contains not only the largest, but also the 

 smallest specimens before us. 



Color Notes. — The general coloration ranges from cinnamon to 

 clove brown tinged with tawny, frequently more or less flecked with 

 a darker shade and occasionally with grayish, which gives to certain 

 females a rather clo.se superficial resemblance to A', maculatus. 

 Both e.xtremes are represented by numerous specimens in the series 




442 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



before us, those of cinnamon coloration hav'ing in almost every case 

 been taken in the undergrowth of the pine woods. 



The coloration of the specimens here described is as follows. Occi- 

 put and vertex mars Vjrown; face shining piceous, sharply delineated 

 from the vertex bj' a paler edging of the latter and crossed by a verj- 

 striking but narrow supra-ocellar band; post -ocular region pale 

 russet. Maxillary palpi with proximal segments cinnamon, terminal 

 segment dark, shading abruptly from cinnamon to clove brown in the 

 proximal fifth. Pronotum mars brown with ventro-caudal angle of 

 lateral lobes clove brown, the immediate margin at this point very 

 pale. Dorsal surfaces of limbs russet, flecked with darker brown; 

 external face of caudal femora, however, strikingly marked with two 

 narrow longitudinal bands of clove brown tinged with tawny. Teg- 

 mina of male shining piceous, discoidal vein cream color, which 

 coloration is continued as a narrow distal border to both dorsal and 

 lateral fields, thereby giving the insect a verj- trim appearance; of 

 female shining piceous, the intermediate channel buffy. Dorsal 

 •surface of abdomen of male clove brown tinged with tawny; of 

 female mars brown, that portion hidden by the tegmina piceous in 

 both sexes. In both se.xes the ventral surface of the body and limlis 

 is cinnamon. 



A number of females before us have the entire dorsal fields of the 

 tegmina of the same paler coloration as the intermediate channel 

 and in such specimens this surface is usually flecked with darker 

 brown. Some specimens have the lateral lol)es of the pronotum 

 unicolorous, dark or light brown, and the pale coloration of the 

 margin of the ventro-caudal angle is often much reduceil or entirely 

 absent. In a very few of the palest colored sjiecimens the striking 

 markings of the external faces of the caudal tii:)i8e are absent. The 

 striking cephalic markings are always distinct and are an excellent 

 specific character. 



Distribution. — The present species is known to range from Florence, 

 South Carolina, and Gwinnett County in northern Georgia, south- 

 ward over that State and throughout the mainland of Florida. 



Biological \otes. — .\llard states that the present s])ecies is the first 

 to appear at Thompson's Mills in north Georgia, and describes its 

 song as a verj' brief, high-i)itched, and .shrill "tiiiiiiii-tiiiiii-tiiiiiiiii- 

 tiiiiiiii." He further remarks, "It is one of the commonest species 

 of N^emobixis in this vicinity and begins to stridulate as soon as spring 

 opens in ]\Iarch and April. In April, 1910, very cold periods of 

 weather with considerable sleet and snow completely silenced these 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 443 



hardy crickets. Notwithstanding this inclement weather, these 

 crickets were always in active stridulation as soon as the days became 

 warmer." The present author has often noticed the same hardiness 

 of this species at Thomasville, Ga., during the winter months, and 

 from there southward the insects are found adult throughout the 

 year. It seems singular that a species showing such hardj' habits 

 is so limited in northward distribution. It is our opinion that no 

 macropterous form of the present species exists.

Subgenus BRACHY.NE.MOBIUS n. subgcn. 



The subgenus i.s monotypic. Type of subgenus — Xemobius

Subgeneric Description. — Size large for genus. Disto-vcutral spurs

 nearly rigidly straight; apex with the margin of that portion formed 

 by the dorsal valves straight and armed with serrulations, the portion 

 formed by the ventral valves unarmed. 



The present subgenus finds its nearest relationship in the Xorth 

 American subgenera to Alloneinobius, from which it dift'ers in the 

 shorter heavier spines of the caudal tibiae, the ovipositor which has 

 the apex with that portion formed by the dorsal valves not obliquely

This species appears to be related more nearly to Xemobius fasciatus 

 socius than to any of the other Xorth American species of the genus. 

 It differs distinctly from that species in the characters given in 

 separating the present subgenus from the subgenus Allonemobius 

 as well as in certain important characters of color pattern. 



A certain relationship is shown to Xemobius brasiliensis in the 

 characters of the apex of the ovipositor, but in other respects the.se 

 species tliffer very widely.

 Description of Type. — Size large, form robust; head large, very 

 full and rounded, about as wide as the pronotum. Maxillary palpi 

 much as in X. fasciatus, and eyes and pronotal proportions likewise 

 similar. Tegmina not as long as caudal femora, apex at humeral 

 angle less broadly obtuse-angulate than in most species, sutural 

 margin i^a.sses into distal margin with scarcely any angulation, 

 longitudinal veins not heavy, cros.s-veinlets very faint. Wings

Color Notes. — General coloration of head, pronotum, tegmina, and 

 abdomen clove brown; the dorso-caudal portion of the occiput is 

 russet, this marking extending on the sides of the head as a narrow 

 line which borders the caudal margin of the ej'es, the remaining 

 post-ocular portion of the genae being of the darker general colora- 

 tion. In front of the paler marking of the occiput there is an indica- 

 tion of four very narrow and faint longitudinal lines of this color 

 and the dorsum of the pronotum is also minutely dotted with russet. 

 In the female the intermediate channel of the tegmina is broccoli 

 brown, in the male wood brown. The limbs are bistre in the female, 

 drab in the male. Ovipositor dark burnt umber. 



The specimen from Costa Rica was taken when it had recently 

 reached the adult condition ; this specimen shows scarcely any 

 cephalic markings. 



Di.itribution. — The present .species is known only from Mescico, 

 Mex., and San Jose, Costa Rica. 



Hynonymy. — It is surprising that Scudder, in 1890, considered his 

 specimens of this aberrant species to be the same as the very different 

 Nemobius cubensis mormoniiis, which insect he then erroncouslj' 

 believed to be Nemobius mexicanus Walker.

446 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AC.UJEMY OF [JunC, 



Subgeneric Description. — Size very large for the genus. Pronotum 

 with width ahiiost twice the length, much more transverse than in 

 the other North American subgenera. Disto-ventral spurs of caudal 

 tibia very unequal in length. Proximal-internal spine of caudal 

 tibia in male specialized as described under Morphological Notes 

 for the genus; other spines very long, below concave, with margins 

 of this sulcation minutely serrulate in both sexes, the disto-internal 

 spine not specialized. Ovipositor long, nearly rigidly straight; 

 apex with the margin of that portion armed by the dorsal valves 

 straight and armed with serrulations, the portion formed by the 

 ventral valves unarmed. The glossiness of the only known North 

 American species of this subgenus is very striking. 



The present subgenus finds its nearest relationship in the North 

 American subgenera to Allonemobius and Brachyncmobius. In form 

 it is perhaps somewhat nearer the former, while the shape and 

 armament of the apex of the ovipositor is similar to that found in the 

 latter subgenus.

This insect is distinguished from all other species of the genus 

 Nemobius, excepting .V. major, by its very large size, peculiar color 

 pattern and glossiness, and ovijwsitor with the straight dorsal margin 

 of the apex armed with serrulations. 



Without being able to examine the type of m<ijor, we do not feel 

 warranted in considering it a brachypterous individual of the present 

 species. Saussure's description shows major to be very closely allied 

 to brasiliensis, differing from it in the less transverse pronotum, with 

 bands on either side of the same, anil the longer ovipositor.

Size very large for the genus; form compact; head rather large 

 and rounded but a little flattened in front. Maxillarj- palpi of 

 much the same form as in N. fasciatus. 

 Pronotum extremely transverse with 

 length contained nearly twice in greatest 

 (caudal) dorsal width, narrowing evenly

The specimens before us indicate that there is a moderate amount 

 of size variation in the present species, particularly in the length of 

 the ovipositor, but the specimens from Mexico and Paraguay are 

 surprisingly similar for material from localities so widclj- separated. 



Color Notes. — The specimens before us are very similar in colora- 

 tion; those from Nicaragua, Brazil, and Paraguay are slightly darker 

 than the Mexican individuals. General color glossy cream-buff or 



Fig. 98. — Nemohius hrasilicnsis. Ovipo.sitor. (Greatly maKnifieil.) 



A'ery pale glossy tawny-olive, the underparts somewhat paler. Head 

 of general coloration, the occiput distinctly striped with three longi- 

 tudinal lines of nmmmy brown, eyes bistre. Maxillary palpi covered 

 with short dark hairs, of general coloration with the excejJtion of the 

 extreme apex of the terminal segment which is bistre. Pronotum of 

 general coloration with a large meso-dorsal maculation of mummy 

 brown, the caudo-lateral jiortions of this maculation are of somewhat 

 darker coloration and remain as two dark dots in the palest specimens 

 in which the dark markings are very much reduced. In the palest 

 .specimens the tegmina ami wings are of the general coloration, with 

 the excei)tion of a very small dark area at the discoido-anal root 

 basin of the tegmina which in the darker specimens is greatly exi)anded 

 and the entire exposed portions of the tegmina and wings are suffused 

 with mummy brown; intermediate channel very slightly paler than

lateral fields of tegmina. Ovipositor russet, the apex burnt umber. 

 The glossy and characteristic coloration combined with the large 

 size and certain different proportions give the present insect a very 

 distinctive appearance. 



Distribution. — Though known from few specimens, the present 

 species has the widest distribution of any American species of the 

 genus, being found from the .state of Vera Cruz in ]\Iexico southward 

 through Nicaragua and Brazil to Paraguay and westward to the 

 province of Atacama in Chile. 



Biological Xotes. — Xo brachypterous specimens of the present 

 species are known. 



Synonymy. — Scudder, in 1896, described Xemobius tnelleus from a 

 single specimen from San Rafael, Vera Cruz, Mex., apparently 

 omitting comparison with or reference to the South American species 

 of the genus. We here place this species in the synonymy under 

 brasiliensis, for after careful examination of the types of the two 

 species we find that no differential characters exist.

Subgenus XEONEMOBIUS n. subgen. 



This subgenus includes four species and two geographic races 

 from North America. Type of Subgenus — Xemobius cubensis 

 Saussure. 



Subgeneric Description. — Size medium to very small for the genus. 

 Disto-ventral spurs of caudal tibia very unequal in length. Proximo- 

 internal spine of caudal tibiae in male specialized as "described under 

 Morphological Xotes for the genus ; other spines of caudal tibiae 

 below concave, with margins of this sulcation very minutely serrulate 

 in both sexes, the disto-internal spine not specialized. Ovipositor 

 short, about two-thirds the length of the caudal femur, gently curved*" 



" This specimen was unfortunately recorded as A'', fascialus by Saussure in the 

 Biologia. 



'» We find the species .Vewobiu-s hruiieri to be a somewhat aberrant member 

 of this subgenus, having a more decidedly curved and slightly heavier ovi- 

 positor than in the other species, the apex of which has the dorsal margin armed 

 with serrations. 



The species Xemobius loHeciis shows all of these aberrations to an even greater 

 degree. Both of these species arc considerably more robust than the other 

 species of the present subgenus. 




450 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Juiie, 



and more slender than in the species having a more rigid ovipositor; 

 apex with margin of portion formed by dorsal valves nearly straight 

 or obliquely sul)truncate and armed with serrulations or serrations, 

 the portion formed by the ventral valves unarmed.

This striking species has a decided superficial resemblance to the 

 Old World A', sylvestris, from which species it differs in being a little 

 smaller and in having the ovipositor curved and armed and the 

 tegmina not obliquely truncate. 



From the North American species it may be separated readily by 

 its color pattern combined with the characters of the ovipo.sitor which 

 is considerably heavier and more curved than in any of these. 



Type: 9 ; Mexico (probably State of Oaxaca). [Tj-pe lost.] 



We here describe a female from Omilteme, Guerrero, Alex., taken 

 in July at an elevation of 8,000 feet by H. H. Smith and now in the 

 British Museum. 



Size large (for the genus), form heavy and compact; head rather 

 large, full and rounded, about as wide as the pronotum. Pronotum 

 with length containetl not cjuite one and four-tenths times in greatest 

 (caudal) dorsal width, narrowing slightly cephalail. Tegmina very 

 short, not half as long as the caudal ft'mora; distal margin of dorsal 

 field alnio.st transver.se, very broadly arcuato-truncate; intermediate 

 channel distinctly depressed; longitudinal veins rather heavy; 

 cross-veinlets faint. Wings absent. Ovipositor very heavy, length 

 contained about one and one-half times in that of the caudal femora, 

 distinctly arcuate (decidedly so for the genus), apex of same narrowly 

 sublanceolate enlarged with that portion formed by the dorsal 

 valves armed, the upper margin serrate, these serrations small, short 

 and blunt (heavier than in any of the other North .\merican species 

 having a curved ovipositor), ("audal femora heavy, greatest (ineso- 

 cephalic) width contained slightly more than two and one-half times 

 in length. 



The male of the present .species is unknown.

Color Xotes. — The coloration of this species shows a similarity to 

 that of the European N. sylvestris. Head and dorsum of pronotum 

 chestnut, maxillary palpi yellowish with distal portion of ultimate 

 joint dark brown. Dorsal field of tegmina .straw color, lateral lobes 

 of pronotum and lateral field of tegmina very dark brown. Body 

 and limbs brown, somewhat tinged with reddish. 



Distribution. — The present species is known from probably but 

 three specimens, these taken in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca, 

 Mex. 



Biological Notes. — All of the known specimens of the present 

 .species are brachypterous. 



Synonymy. — In 18G9, Walker very inadequately described .V. 7nexi- 

 canus from Oaxaca, Me.x., which species Saussure, in 1874, synon- 

 ymized with his N. toltecus (described in 1859 from Mexico, probably 

 Oaxaca). Scudder, however, in 1896, resurrected mexicanus without 

 having examined the type, and the specimens so recorded at that 

 time were so quoted in the Biologia by Saussure the following year, 

 without doubt because Scudder's recent revision of the North Ameri- 

 can species of Xemobius should have indicated that his knowledge 

 of the North American members of the genus was superior to that of 

 others. It is the opinion of the present author that Saussure was 

 entirely correct in synonymizing mexicanus with his toltecus, and in 

 the present paper the opinion which he held in 1874 is followed. We 

 have not been able to find the type of mexicanus Walker, but we have 

 before us the series of specimens which Scudder considered mexicanus, 

 and it is our opinion that these do not fit Walker's original description, 

 but that that description agrees much better with the description 

 and the specimen examined of toltecus. We are further strengthened 

 in this opinion by the series of Xemobius which .Scudder considered 

 toltecus in the .same paper of 1896, but which in fact l)elong to the 

 very different X. carolinus neomexicanus, which series is now before us.

This species is related to A", toltecus in the shape and armament of 

 the ovipositor, but differs in being smaller, of very different color 

 pattern and having a much less heavy ovipositor. 



It may be readily separated from all other North American species 

 by its head markings and peculiar color pattern which gives it a 

 dotted and speckled appearance, and also by the characters of the 

 ovipositor. The insect is in no way nearly related to any other 

 species of Nemobius found north of the Rio Grande, but some of the 

 more mottled specimens of N. cubensis mormonius from Texas bear 

 it a certain amount of superficial resemblance.

There is considerable variation in proportion and size in the series 

 before us, large and small individuals being found in the same region 

 as the measurements of the Washington and Cabin John Run speci- 

 mens show. The majority of specimens from the Atlantic coast 

 are about intermediate in size between the extremes. 



Color Xotes. — The coloration of the specimens here described is 

 tjTjical of the series before us, the only variation shown being a small 

 amount of intensification or diminution of the color pattern in a few 

 specimens. General coloration clay color mottled and flecked with 

 mummy brown. Head below and including the interantennal space 

 shining Vandyke brown, above cinnamon more or less maculate with 

 mummy brown above the interantennal space and on the liase of the 

 occiput, the broad occipital bar of cinnamon thus formed usually 

 rather conspicuous, eyes dark l)istr(\ Maxillary palpi claj' color, the 

 distal portion of the terminal segment mummy brown. Pronotum 

 clay color, more or less mottled and flecked with nuunmy l)rown, this 

 mottling often heavy .in the median portion of the dorsum, and 

 particularly so on the lateral lobes. Tegmina of male sei)ia, discoidal 

 vein cream color but usually very incons])icuous, discoido-anal root- 

 basin and upper portion of lateral field bistre; of female liistre, with 

 veins and intermediate channel clay color. Dorsal surface of abdo- 

 men of male (concealed by tegmina) clove brown; of female cephalic 

 portion (concealed by tegmina) clove brown, exposed portion clay 

 color more or less maculate with clove brown. Ovipositor burnt 

 umber. Ventral surface of body clay color. Limbs clay color 

 tinged with russet and more or less mottled and flecked with prouts 

 brown. 



The .specimens from Wichita, Kan., differ from the rest of the 

 scries in having the lower portion of the head cinnamon instead of 

 Vandyke brown, and the intermediate channel of the female tegmina 



i 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 455 



is more decidedlj' defined in the paler color than in the other speci- 

 mens. In every other respect, however, these specimens are typical. 



Distribution. — The present species is known from the vicinity of 

 the District of Columbia, west-central Indiana, northeastern 

 Nebraska, and northeastern and south-central Kansas. 



Biological Notes. — No macropterous specimens of this insect are 

 known. 



Synonymy. — The history of the present species is a succession of 

 unfortunate occurrences. In 1885, Bruner recorded specimens of 

 Nemobius sp. from Topeka, Kan., which belong to this species; 

 later, in 1893, he drew up a description of the species which was never 

 published, hence his Cyrtoxyphus ? variegatus Bruner (Mss.), an 

 unidentifiable name from the literature, but the" material before us 

 from the Bruner Collection shows it to be this species. 



Before 1897, Blatchley sent a series of Indiana specimens of 

 Nemobius to Scudder for determination, and the present species was 

 inexcusaV)ly identified for him as N. carolinus Scudder, hence his 

 subsequent misconception of that species, and Caudell upon seeing 

 specimens of Blatchley's material so labelled followed him in this 

 error; thus material sent him for determination by Iselj' was likewise 

 recorded as carolinus.

The large series of the present species, which is the type of the 

 subgenus Xeonemobius, before us shows that a very close relationship 

 exists to A", polustris. although typical A', cubensis looks very different 

 from that species, being larger, of less dark and solid coloration, with 

 tegmina almost always much less abbreviate. A careful study of the 

 material at hand shows that there are, however, specimens in the 

 series of cube7isis which can scarcely be separated from palustris. 

 These few extreibe individuals are as small and of much the same 

 form as palustris, Avith wings lacking and tegmina quite as abbreviate 

 as in that species. Almost every one of these specimens, however, 

 is not as solid in coloration, and all but two are more pale in general 

 coloration. The majority of specimens of cubensis wanting wings 

 have the tegmina considerably less abbreviate than in palustris, a 

 number of these having the tegmina quite as well developed as in 

 those specimens having the longest wings. In summing up the 

 differences between the two species we may add that, in addition to 

 the other differential characters, cubensis usually has the under ]ior- 

 tions of the body ciuite pale, much paler than is normal in polustris. 



From typical .specimens of the western race, A', cubensis mormonius, 

 typical individuals of the present species may be readily separated 

 by their less robust build and more solid coloration without the 

 characteristic cephalic and tegminad markings of that race. In 

 fact, so different are typical specimens of the two that, were it wot for 

 the very large series before us which reveals the vast amount of 

 variability found in thes(> insects, we should certainly have considered 

 them distinct species. 



Small dark macr()i)ten)us males of X. f/iscialus have been mistaken 

 for this species, l)ut the heavier build and less smooth ai)pearanc(^ 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 457 



of that species should always distinguish readily even the most 

 aberrant males from cubensis, while the ovipositor characters of the 

 females show the two species to belong to different subgenera. 



Little has apparently been known of the life history of the present 

 species, and it is probably due to the fact that the majority of speci- 

 mens collected have been taken flying to lights at night that so few 

 brachypterous specimens have been previously recorded. 



Types: 4 cf, 5 5 ; Cuba. (Poey.) [Saussure Collection.] 



We here describe a female from Cuba, taken by Gundlach, and now 

 in the Scudder Collection. 



Size small, form slender for the genus; head small but full and 

 rounded, wider than cephalic width of pronotum. Maxillarj- palpi

 as much produced. Eyes broad-ovate, very mildly prominent , though 

 .somewhat more so than in .V. palustris. Pronotum of nmch the same

proportions as in fasciafus, but of smaller relative size to rest of 

 body. Tegmina long, extending beyond end of abdomen, apex of 

 same dorsal in position, distal margin of dorsal field rotundate acute- 

 angulate, longitudinal veins not very prominent, cross-veinlets very 

 faint. Wings absent. Ovipositor more than two-thirds as long as 

 caudal femur, distinctly though very feebly arcuate; apex of same 

 very narrowly sublanceolate, with that portion formed by the dorsal 

 valves armed, the upper margin serrulate, these serrulations very 

 closely arranged, regular, minute, .sharp. Caudal femora with 

 greatest (meso-cephalic) width contained about three times .in 

 length. Spines of caudal tibiae more .slender than in fasciafus, not 

 quite as slender as in palustris. 



A male in the Scudder Collection, bearing the same ilata as the 

 female here described, affords the following additional information. 



Size very slightly smaller, proportions very nmch the same. The 

 tegmina are translucent, and when in repose the dorsal fields are hemi- 

 elliptical in outline. Wings very long. Proximo-internal spine of 

 caudal tibia" similar to that of fa.'iciaius.

It is evident that the variation in the present species and its races 

 is further emphasized bj- the measurements given above. It is true 

 that the specimens from Vera Cruz, Mexico, and Castillo, Nicaragua, 

 have in the female se.x ovipositors very much shorter than are found 

 in any of the other specimens before us. These specimens are also 

 different in being the onlj- ones at hand having the lower portion of 

 the head much paler than the upper portion, and the maxillary palpi 

 pale with only the distal portion of the terminal segment very dark. 

 In other respects these specimens agree almost perfectly with typical 

 cubensis, and after a careful consideration of the variation in the 

 species, these differences do not warrant considering this material 

 worthy of racial distinction. 



Color Notes. — The specimens here described agree well with other 

 macropterous specimens of the .species before us in the coloration 

 here given. General color very dark vandyke brown, glossy, shading 

 to burnt umber on limbs and tegmina. Head and pronotum very 

 dark vandyke brown, immaculate, shining; eyes equally dark. 

 Maxillary palpi*- vandyke brown, the terminal segment very dark. 

 That portion of the head which fits under the pronotum may be 

 seen to be a very little paler than the other parts of the head when 

 examined closely. Tegmina translucent, shading from vandyke 

 brown in the proximal portion to burnt umber on the greater part 

 of both dor.sal and lateral fields; intermediate channel very faintly 

 defined in Ijurnt umber. Dorsal surface of abdomen shining black. 

 Exposed portion of wings burnt umber, concealed portion very white 

 when folded. Limbs and ventral surface of insect immaculate, 

 limbs above prouts brown, ventral surface pale, but varying con- 

 siderably in depth of coloration. 



We have but one large series of brachypterous specimens of cubensis 

 Ijefore us, these from Homestead, Fla.,the majority of which specimens 

 are not of as solid coloration and are of somewhat lighter shatle than 

 the specimens described above. In these the penultimate segment 

 of the maxillary i)alpi is mummy brown, the other segments of the 

 very dark general coloration. Pronotum a little maculate with 

 mummy brown, tegmina marked with the same color, the intermediate 

 channel quite distinctlj^ defined in the lighter color in several speci- 

 mens. Limbs prouts brown, maculate to a slight degree with darker 

 shades. 



" In some very dark specimens before us, the penultimate segment of the 

 maxillary palpi is nearly white, while the other segments are very dark; in a few 

 of the other specimen.s only the distal portion of the terminal segment is verj- dark. 




460 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AC.U)EMY OF [Juue, 



Other brachypterous specimens before us are even darker than the 

 normal coloration, being colored very similarly to A', palustris, but 

 in almost all cases having much longer tegmina, and in the one or two 

 cases where this is not true they are larger than the largest specimens 

 of that species. 



Distribution. — The present species is known from Stat en Island, 

 X. Y., south along the Atlantic coast to the extreme southern portion 

 of the mainland of Florida, and also from Cuba, Vera Cruz in Mexico, 

 Nicaragua and Costa Rica to Brazil. Its western distribution in the 

 United States appears to be limited by the fall-line. The records 

 given by Scudder and Blatchlej' for Illinois and Indiana pertain to 

 other species. 



Biological Xotes. — Though seldom numerous, the present insect 

 appears to be always much more plentiful near the sea than elsewhere; 

 the writer has found it in large numbers but once, in the higli grass 

 of the everglades. Of all the North American species of Xemobius 

 it develops in the macropterous form proportionately the longest 

 tegmina and wings. The majority of macropterous specimens 

 taken have been captured flying to lights at night ; about such places 

 we have never found this insect anything but very scarce. Con- 

 sidering the usual extreme development of the tegmina and wings 

 in the present species, it is surprising to find .some brachypterous 

 specimens with tegmina quite as much aborted as in A', palustris. 



Synonymy. — In 1877, Scudder described Xemobius volaticus, which 

 species he himself placed in the synonymy under cuben.^is in 1896. 

 We here .select a male of that .series from Georgia in the Scudder 

 Collection as single type.°^ 



In Scudder"s 1896 paper on the North American species of the 

 genus, he unfortunately created confusion by misidentifying much 

 material, one instance of which was the crediting of specimens of the 

 present species from Lake Worth, Fla., to A', carolinus and another 

 in taking a small dark brachypterous female of cubensis as the basis 

 of the description of that s(>x of his new and doubly invalid A', aterri- 

 mus. 



In 19U.">, Helm and Hchard, at a loss to fathom the literature, 

 credite<l a pair of dark cubensis, having long tegmina but no wings, 

 from Tampa, Fla., to aterrimus.

The present geographic race varies widely in general appearance, 



owing probaljly to the facts that its range includes a great variety of 



territory, and that as this range includes so much of the semiarid 




462 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AC.U)EMY OF [JuUC, 



and desert regions of the West, it is found more or less isolated at a 

 great number of localities. Brachypterous individuals somewhat 

 outnumber the macropterous. Though the specimens in each respect- 

 ive series from Texas, from Nevada, and from Vera Cruz, INIex., are 

 quite similar, each series has a decidedly distinctive appearance; 

 intermediates between these are, however, always to be found. 



The general resemblance to .V. carolinus neomexicamis is sometimes 

 so very close that, were it not for the fact that in this species the 

 disto-dorsal spurs of the caudal femora are unequal, while in carolinus 

 7ieomexicanus they are equal, it would be impossible to distinguish 

 some of the males of the two, though the females are readily separable 

 by the verj' different characters of the ovipositor as well. 



So different are individuals from the Texan region, the arid South- 

 west and southern Mexico, that there is little wonder that several 

 sj^nonyms of the present insect exist, and it would seem advisable to 

 recognize at least three geographic races, were it not for the fact 

 that practically all of the differences are due to coloration, probably 

 caused by the immediate enviromnent and, as would be expected 

 in such a case, every conceivable intergradation is found in the large 

 series before us. 



The insect differs from A', cubensis in being less slender, in having

a different color pattern, and in being more mottled and almost 

 always considerably paler in general coloration. The color pattern 

 and its variations, consequently important in determining the present 

 insect, is fully treated in the Color Notes.

Though some amount of variation is showni in each of the series 

 before us, there appears to be little difference in the size and pro- 

 portions of specimens from the various natural divisions of the range 

 of the present iasect. As has been noticed in other species, macrop- 

 terous specimens always are found to have the pronotum more 

 widened caudad. 



Color Notes. — The great majority of specimens from Texas are of

the type of coloration here described. General color mummy brown, 

 inconspicuously marbled with sepia and bistre. Head raw umber, 

 a very narrow line of darker shade extending across the occiput from 

 the caudal margin of the eyes, the remaining caudal portion of the 

 occiput and postocular portion of the gente somewhat paler than the 

 re.st of the head. Eyes prouts brown. Maxillary palpi raw umber, 

 the distal half of the terminal segment clove brown. Pronotum 

 mummy brown clouded with bistre, under a Zeiss binocular small 

 dots of wood brown are apparent. Tcgraina translucent; of male 

 with ilorsal field a very dark shade of bistre particularly pronounced 

 in the proximal portion, discoidal vein obscurely outlined in cream 

 color, lateral fields clove brown; of female bistre much suffused with 

 raw umber, the longitudinal veins of the dorsal field, the intermediate 

 channel and ventral margin of lateral fields raw umber, remaining 

 portion of lateral fields clove brown. Dorsal surface of abdomen of 

 males and macropterous females (concealed beneath tegmina) 

 .shining black; of brachypterous females, proximal (concealed) 

 portion of the same color, remaining portion black somewhat maculate 

 with raw umber and coveretl with hairs of the same color. Ovi- 

 positor Vandyke brown. Limbs tawny olive slightly mottled with 

 raw umber, the outer face of the caudal femora marked with two 

 faint longitudinal bars of the latter color. 



The material before us from the state of Vera Cruz, j\Iex., resembles 

 the.se specimens, but the majority are somewhat darker with a more 

 russet suffu.sion, and the markings which give most of the specimens 

 from Texas a somewhat marbled appearance are considerably 

 reduced. The distinctive markings of the head are^^, however, in 

 most cases more pronounced. This type of coloration, as well as 

 intermediates between it and the normal Texan type, is represented 

 i)y a number of specimens from Texas. 



The majority of specimens from Fort Yuma, Cal., and Lower 

 California, are of a very pale desert type of coloration. So pale 

 are tiiese that the color pattern has in most cases almost disappeared. 

 General color wood brown, faintly marked with a darker shade. 

 Head mars brown, a paler caudal jxjrtion of the occiput only detect- 

 able under the Zeiss binocular. Disk of pronotum of general color

marbled with a darker shade, lateral lobes heavily marked with very 

 dark bistre. Tegmina mummy brown marked cephalad with dark 

 bistre. Ovipositor burnt umber. Limbs and ventral surface of 

 body wood brown tinged with russet, the longitudinal markings on 

 the outer surface of the caudal femora very faintly indicated. Inter- 

 mediates between this and the normal Texan type are to be found in 

 specimens from San Jose del Cabo, L. Cal., Las Vegas, Nev., aiid 

 Brownsville, Tex. 



The typical series from St. George, L'tah, all of the Californian 

 specimens except those from Fort Yuma, and almost the entire series 

 from Las Vegas, Nev., belong to a color phase closely resemliling 

 . that of the specimens from Vera Cruz, excepting that these specimens 

 are not so much tinged with russet, the usually distinctive cephalic 

 markings are very obscure (practically absent in many cases), while 

 the females have the intermediate channel of the tegmina strikingly 

 cream colored. Intermediates between this type of coloration and 

 that of the Mexican series are at hand, but in none of the Texan 

 series is a close approach to this to be found. In all other respects, 

 however, the specimens are inseparable and consequently not worthy 

 of even racial distinction. 



Distribution. — The present geographic race is known to range from 

 Biloxi, Miss., to the Pacific coast, and southward as far as the state 

 of Tabasco, Mex. The most northern localities at which it has been 

 taken are St. George, Utah, Las Vegas, Nev., and the Panamint 

 Valley, Cal. 



Biological A'otes. — In the desert regions of the southwestern 

 United States this insect is but very occasionally met with in the 

 short grasses growing near streams and other restricted damp areas, 

 but in the semiarid mescjuite region of Texas it is widely distributed 

 in the short grasses which are there so frequently encountered; and 

 its range extends still further eastward, where it is found in the 

 typical undergrowth of the long-leaf pine forests. A few macropter- 

 ous specimens have been taken at light at Beaumont, Brownsville, 

 and Del Rio, Tex.; other than at light this long-winged form has 

 scarcely ever been encountered. 



Morphological Notes. — It is the opinion of the author that the 

 considerable amount of variation found in the present in.sect is due 

 to its frequent isolation together with its very extensive distribution. 

 Though ranging over all the desert regions of the southwest, this 

 insect, like all other North .\merican Xcinobius, is never found unless 

 a certain amount of moistur<' is present. In its desert ilistribution 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 467 



there are consequently often hundreds of square miles utterly unfit 

 for the insect, since it is only found where some dampness is derived 

 from a river or stream, a lake, or some subterranean water supply. 

 There is little variation in erny of the specimens from the heavier 

 portion of the Texan mesquite belt where its range is not 

 discontinuous. 



Sytwnymy. — When the present geographic race was described in 

 1896, Scudder wrongly believed a series of specimens of this insect 

 from the state of Vera Cruz, Me.x., to belong to the poorly described 

 N. mexicanus of Walker, and he also failed to recognize as such pale 

 specimens of the same from Texas and Lower California which he 

 determined as A', carolinus and .V. neomexicanus (both belonging 

 to the subgenus Eunemobius, which has the disto-ventral spurs of 

 the caudal tibiae ecjual and the apex of the ovipositor an.-ed above 

 and below). 



In 1897, Saussure, supposing Scudder to be correct in his statements, 

 followed him in quoting the records of what Scudder supposed to be 

 mexicanus, but without seeing the material, and so a single specimen 

 of the pale color form of cubensis mormonius in his possession from 

 Durango or Sinaloa, Mex., was to him apparently new and so de- 

 scribed as -V. comanchus. In the same paper Saussure considered 

 specimens from Tab'a-sco, Mex., to be A', atbensis. 



Hart recorded this insect as A'. mexicanuH in 1906.

Thi,s species, the smallest of the North American members of the 

 genus, may be sei)arated from the other North American species of 

 Nemobius belonging to the subgenus Xeonemobius by its very small 

 size, slender hiiiUl, and very dark .>*olid coloration. 



The species reseml)les A', conftisits closely in general a|)pearance, 

 but examination quickly shows that species to belong to the suiigenus 

 Eunemobius. 



The closest affinity is foimd in .V. cubcnsin, from wiiiiii s[ifcies it 

 differs in being smaller in the great majority of cases, of tlarker and 

 more solid coloration, without tegminal markings of any kind. 

 In the male the tegmina are almost always le.-<s broad, and in the 

 female are usually more ai)breviate.

Described from an unspecified series of specimens from nortliern 

 Indiana. 



Single type here designated: 9 ; Fulton County, Indiana. 

 October 5, 1898. (Blatchley.) [Blatchley Collection]. 



Description of Type. — Size very small and form sleniler for the 

 genus, head small, but full and rounded, wider than the cephalic 

 width of the pronotum. Maxillary palpi of 

 much the same form as in X . fasciatus, but with 

 segments not as much produced. Eyes broad- 

 ovate, not prominent. Pronotum*^ of much 

 the same proportions as in fasciatus, but of 

 smaller relative size to the rest of the body. 

 Tegmina very slightly more than half as long 

 as the caudal femora; apex at humeral angle, 

 verj' broadly and roundly obtuse-angulate; 

 distal margin of dorsal field very slightly 

 oblique, very broadly arcuato-truncate; sutural 

 margin passes into distal margin with a dis- 

 tinct but broadly rounded angulation at an 

 angle of slightly more than ninety degrees; 

 intermediate channel not conspicuou.sly de- 

 pres.sed and forming part of the dorsal field, this field unusually 

 evenly rounded; longitudinal veins very conspicuous, cross-veinlets 

 very few and extremely oV^scure. Wings absent. Ovipositor about 

 two-thirds as long as caudal femora, distinctly though feebly 

 arcuate; apex of same narrowly sublanceolate, with that portion 

 formed by the dorsal valves armed, the upper margin serrulate,

these serrulations regular, minute, shar]), as closely arranged as in 

 N. cubensis. Caudal femora with greatest (meso-cephalic) width 

 contained .slightly more than three times in the length. Spines of 

 caudal tibiae considerably more slender than in fasciatus and .supplied 

 with fewer hairs. 



"The serio.s of tlic present species before us shows that though the majority 

 have the pronotum narrowing very slightly rephalad, some few have the cephalic 

 and caudal width of the .same subequal, while in other specimens the pronotimi 

 narrows decidedly (■epliala<l.

The specimens from Ontario are the smallest before us, while those 

 from North Carolina are the largest. Additional material at hand 

 bears out this evidence that the species increases in size ven>' gra<luallj' 

 from north to south over its range. Comparativelj' little variation 

 is shown, however, in the present species. 



Color Notes. — The types here described are of the .same coloration 

 as the majority of topotj'pic specimens before us. The head, pro- 

 notum, and limbs are solid Vandyke brown. Maxillan,- palpi vandyke 

 brown with the exception of the tenninal joint which is wholly clove 




1913.] N'ATVRAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHLi. 471 



brown. Tegmina and dorsal surface of abdomen dark clove brown. 

 0'\'ipositor dark Vandyke brown. 



The majority of specimens not from Indiana are, however, some- 

 what differently colored. These specimens have the entire dorsal 

 surface of the body dark clove brown, while midemeath the usual 

 coloration is raw umber. In such specimens the maxUlan,- palpi 

 usually have the third joint a rather light brown, the penultimate 

 joint considerably paler and the terminal joint wholly clove brown. 

 Both males and females of the present species have a rather shiny 

 appearance. 



Distribution. — The present species has been found on the Atlantic 

 coast from Xatick and Dover. Mass., to Wilmington and Lake 

 Waccamaw, X. C, and inland has been taken as far north as Algon- 

 quin Park, Ont.. and as far west as Starke County, Ind. 



It is a swamp and bog inhabiting species, and is consequently ven,- 

 local in distribution. 



Biological Xotes. — The present species is extremely secretive, 

 living in the recesses of swamps and bogs, usually in and about 

 sphagnmu mosses. In such situations palustris maj- sometimes be 

 found in verj- large numbers, but the peculiar habitat combined with 

 the small size and sombre coloration of the insects themselves, 

 e.vplains their usual scarcity in collections. When disturbed, indi- 

 viduals of palustris leap about vigorously and then burrow into the 

 sphagnum mosses or hide under roots or debris. Dr. Walker de- 

 scribes the song of this species as "a continuous and rather feeble 

 trill" and notes a similarity to that of carolinus. 



No macropterous specimens of the species have been taken, and 

 it is our opinion that such do not occur, owing to the fact that in the 

 present species the reduction of the tegmina has reached a rather 

 advanced stage and is found to vary to an extremely small degree. 



Synonymy. — No s\-non\-ms of the present species have occurred, 

 but Allard has unfortunately recorded small dark specimens of 

 A", fasciatus as this species. 



Specimens Examined. — 56: 28 males, 28 females.

The present insect is in all probabilitj' a southern race of A', palus- 

 tris, distinguished only from that species by its peculiar and striking 

 coloration. Unsuccessful efforts have been made to obtain additional 

 material from the region in which the type series was taken, and 

 until this can be done it is, in our opinion, advisable to consider the 

 present insect a geographic race, although it may eventuallj' prove 

 to be a mere color variety. 



Type: cf ; Thomasville, Georgia. In sphagnum. December 6, 

 1903. (Hebard.) [Hebard Collection.] 



Description of Type. — The head, pronotum, and ventral surface of 

 the insect is ochraceous-rufous, the limbs almost uniform ochraceous, 

 and the tegraina and dorsal portion of the abdomen shining black. 

 The maxillary palpi are pale yellowish, with the exception of the last 

 segment, which is darker at the base, shading to clove brown in the 

 apical half. 



The female allotype, here selected, bears the same data as the 

 type and is in the same collection; it is slightly larger than the type, 

 but of the same coloration.

Color Notes. — The contrasting and solid coloration given in the 

 description is distinctive and varies but little in tone in the series. 



Distribution. — The insect is known only from Thomasville, in 

 southwestern Georgia. 



Biological Notes. — The series was taken near the town in a small 

 area of moist ground where the pine woods gave way to the magnolias 

 and beeches of the "branch" forest growth. All of the specime.ns 

 were captured in sphagnum growing among the roots of these latter 

 trees. The entire series is brachypterous. 



Specimens Examined. — 13: 5 males, 8 females.

Subgenus EUNEMOBIUS n. subgen. 



This distinctive subgenus includes two species and two geographic 

 races from North America. Type of subgenus — Nemobius carolinus 

 Scudder. 



Subgeneric Description. — Size medium for the genus. Disto- 

 ventral spurs of caudal tibia equal in length. Proximal and distal 

 internal spines of male specialized as described under Morphological 

 Notes for the genus; other spines of caudal tibia below concave, with 

 margins of this sulcation smooth in both sexes. Ovipositor very 

 short, almost always less than two-thirds the length of the caudal 

 femur, gently curved; apex with dorsal margin armed with heavy 

 teeth, ventral margin armed with minute, widely spaced serrulations. 

 Ventral segments of abdomen in male broadened, extending outward 

 and upward on sides of abdomen above the normal dorsal segments, 

 thus making the abdomen unusually broad and its entire dorsal 

 surface concave. 



The present subgenus is widely separated from the otiier North 

 American subgenera by the majority of the characters given above.

This species, type of the subgenus Eunemobius, is very different 

 from N. confusu^, the only other known North American species 

 belonging to that subgenus. The present insect is almost invariably 

 larger in size, has a more robust structure, less glossy appearance, 

 different color pattern and usually paler coloration; it has also 

 differently colored maxillary palpi and a very different ovipositor 

 in the female. The coloration of the maxillary palpi is of the greatest 

 value as a certain and ready character for the separation of the two 

 species. 



Like N. cubensis, the present species has a widely distril;utcd paler 

 western race, but, unlike that species, the great majority of macro])- 

 terous individuals are found in the western series. 



Based on an unspecified series from North Carolina. 



Single type here designated: cf; North Carolina. [iScudder

We here describe a female taken at Lake Waccamaw, N. C, 

 September S, 1911, bj- Rehn and Hebard and in the Hebard Col- 

 lection. 



Size medium, form rather stout, head small but prominent and 

 wider than cephalic width of pronotum, interantennal projection 

 moderate. Eyes small but prominent, broad-ovate, proportionately 

 broader than in .V. fasciatus, moderately protruding. ^Maxillarj' 

 palpi of much the same form as in that species, but less attenuate. 

 Pronotum with length contained nearly one and two-fifths times in 

 width, narrowing very slightly cephalad, but more abruptly in cephalic 

 third; with a median impressed line more noticeable in the cephalic 

 portion. Tegmina^" ver\- slightly more than half as long as caudal

femur; longitudinal veins decided, not as conspicuous as in A'. 

 confusiis, cross-veinlets very faint. Wings absent. Ovipositor 

 slightly less than two-thirds the length of the caudal femur, distinctly 

 though feebly arcuate; apex of same narrowly sul)lanceolate, with 

 both dorsal and ventral margins armed, the former with heavj', 

 rather widely separated teeth, the latter with minute very widely 

 spaced serrulations. Limbs delicate, spines of caudal tit)ia> rather 

 slender. 



We here describe a male bearing the same data as the female 

 described above. 



Slightly smaller but proportionately broader, particularly in the 

 abdominal portion. Tegmina transparent and delicate, verj- broad 

 and completely enveloping all but the ventral surface of the pecu- 

 liarly broadeneil abdomen; when in repose the dorsal fields are very 

 flat and hemi-elliptical in outline, the lateral margins slightly bowed, 

 subparallel. Wings ab.sent. The ventral segments of the abdomen 

 are extremely- broadened and extend outward and upward on the 

 sides of the aVidomen above the normal dorsal segments, tiuis making 

 the abdomen unusually broad aiil it-; (>ntire <l<)rs:d surface deeply 

 concave. 



"» The form of the female tegmina is useless a.s a character in the present species • 

 owing to its variability. We have before us brachypterous specimens ranging 

 from those which have the ilistal margins of the dors.al field transverse, to those 

 which have these margins decidedly oblique, the degree of angulation of the 

 tegmina also varying considerably.

The specimens before us indicate that there is a certain amount of 

 decrease in l)oth ovipositor and tegminal length in female specimens 

 of the present species southward in its distril)ution. In size the 

 species is somewhat variable over its entire range, the smallest 

 specimens before us being fountl in series from Ontario, Pennsylvania, 

 Georgia, and Florida. Macropterous specimens are exceedingly 

 scarce in the north, almost all of the long-winged specimens before 

 us are from Georgia and Floriila. 



Color XotcK. — The individuals here described are typical of the 

 majority of the specimens at hand. Head very dark mummy brown, 

 the faintest kind of longitudinal lineation barely suggested on the 

 caudal portion of the occiput, which portion is slightly paler than 




478 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Juiie, 



the rest of the head. Eyes very dark brown. Maxillary palpi 

 cream color, the first three segments and base of the fourth much 

 suffused with verj' dark brown, terminal segment cream color with 

 the immediate apex very dark brown. Pronotum vcrj- dark mummy 

 brown, shading to almost lilack on the lateral lobes. Tegmina of 

 both sexes dark mummy brown, shining, transparent; intermediate 

 channel of the same color as the other portions. Limbs raw umber, 

 above very slightly maculate with miunmj- brown. Under portions 

 of limbs and body raw umber. Entire dorsal surface of abdomen of 

 male (concealed) and concealed portion of same in female very dark 

 brown, polished; exposed portion of same in female very dark mummy 

 bro'wn marked with four regular rows of small raw-umber spots. 



In the large series of specimens before us there are many some- 

 what paler or darker than those here described. In the lighter 

 specimens the dark lateral lobes of the pronotum are usuall.y much 

 more noticeable and the spots on the exposed dorsal surface of the 

 abdomen in the female are more di.stinct. The pale color of the 

 maxillarj^ palpi is more yellowish. 



The darker specimens are often almost black on the dorsal surface, 

 the ventral surface mummy brown. The spots on the exposed 

 dorsal surface of the abdomen in the female are greatly reduced or 

 wholly absent. The pale color of the maxillary palpi is almost 

 always white with no yellowish suffusion. 



The markings of the maxillary palpi in this species varies from a 

 type having the apical half of the ultimate joint darkened, to one 

 which bears only a trace of this dark coloration at the extreme apex; 

 this trace of darker coloration is never missing, however, and serves 

 as a character to separate this species from X. confufius. 



Distribution.— This insect is known from the province of Queb(>c 

 to the most southern portion of the mainland of Florida, and 

 west to the great plains and the mesquite region of Texas. 



A.side from .V. fasciatus and its southern race, this species is 

 the most abundant of the genus over almost its entire range. Only 

 in extreme southern Florida is this not true, where X. cubeims 

 is the most plentiful of the species of the genus. The present 

 insect may I)c found in a great variety of situations; it appears 

 to prefer thick grasses growing along the edges of wootllands, 

 the leaf-covered almost bare ground about streams and ponds 

 in Tieavy woods, dark swamps, or marsh land under cat-tails. The 

 song is a high-pitched and continuous trill, more pleasant to the 

 ear than that of X. fasciatus. Tiie majority of .southern macropterous 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 479 



specimens before us were taken when attracted to light at night. 

 Specimens taken on the border of woodlands and in marshlands are, 

 as would be expected, usually pale, while those from the other situa- 

 tions mentioned are almost always dark; no other differences of any 

 kind exist between these. 



Biological Notes. — We find that the peculiarly developed abdomen 

 of the males of the present species acts as a sounding-board for the 

 tympanum. The tegmina fit tightly over the raised margins of the 

 concave dorsal surface of the abdomen in this sex, their apex just 

 covering and fitting closely to the distal extremity of the abdomen. 



Small, dark macropterous specimens of this species from the 

 southern United States have been recorded as A^. cubensis owing to 

 their great superficial resemblance to that species, which, however, 

 belongs to a different subgenus having very different characters. 

 Over the greater portion of the range of this species, macropterous 

 individuals are exceedingly scarce. 



Synonymy. — In 1776, Provancher recorded the .present species as 

 Xemobius exiguus. This was doubtless due to the fact that at that 

 time Scudder had not properly placed Say's Acheta exigua,^'^ which 

 .species is now known to belong to the genus Anaxipha, for Scudder 

 had used the name Xemobius exiguus to record specimens which he 

 realized later belonged in fact to iV. fascintus. 



In 1877, Scudder, described Xemobius volaticus, the males of which 

 are macropterous specimens of .V. cubensis, the females macropterous 

 specimens of A', carolinus, as an examination of the types clearly 

 shows. 



In October of 1877, Provancher corrected his 1876 record, using 

 Xemobius (Anaxipha) septe7itrionalis, as suggested by Scudder (who 

 did not realize that hi.s own species, described the previous April as 

 Xemobius carolinus, was the same) but without describing the species; 

 the next month, however, he described the insect under that name. 



This name was again used by Caulfield in 1887, and first placed 

 in the synonymy under the present species by E. AI. Walker in 1909, 

 though Davis recognized this fact as early as 1896. 



In 1890, Smith wrongly used the name Xemobius exiguus in giving 

 Davis' correct record of Anaxipha exigua.'^'^ 



In 1892, Blatchley used the name Xemobius exiguus, and in 1900, 

 considering it a new species, he gave under the same name a full 

 description, but, as he was unable to validate a name based originally

by Scudder on a misidentification, this name could not stand even if 

 Blatchley's species were not an absolute sj-nonym of Scudder's 

 A', carol inus. as a comparison of a topotypic series of the former from 

 Biatchley with the type of the latter shows us beyond the slightest 

 doubt. Biatchley cannot in any way be criticLsed for belie\'ing the 

 species undescribed, for Scudder, having examined specimens for 

 him, identified individuals of Xemobius bruiieri (described in the 

 present paper and then known only by the latter from specimens 

 bearing Bruner's invalid name Cyrtoxyphus (?) variegatus) as Netnobius 

 carolinus, and ad\-ised him to describe specimens of true Xetnobius 

 caroUmts, Scudder's own species, as new. This great carelessness 

 resulted in Xemobius carolinus being recorded as Xemobius eTiguus 

 by Bruner (with a query) in 1893. Lugger in 1898, Biatchley in 1903, 

 Mead m 1904, Isely and Rehn and Hebard in 1905, and Brimley in 

 1908. 



In 1893, Bruner recorded the species as .V. volaticus with a query. 



In 1894, Beutenmuller described Xemobius affinis, which species 

 was two years later correctly placed in the synonymy under carolinus 

 bj' Scudder, but which name was used by Smith in 1900 and 1910. 



In 1896 and 1900, Scudder recorded specimens of -V. cubensis and 

 X. palustris as the present species, specimens of whick latter he also 

 recorded as .V. cubensis. His discussion of Provancher's "Xemobius 

 (Anaxipha) septcntrionalis" in the former paper is incorrect. 



Lugger's 1898 record of A', socius should probably apply to the 

 present species. 



In 1902, E. M. Walker misidentified a large series of the present 

 species from Ontario as .V. pahistris, and in 1904 believing these records 

 wrong corrected the name to A', confusus. 



The .'same year he described Xemobius angusticollis, placing the 

 specimens from which the above incorrect records were given in the 

 typical series. This name is an absolute sjTionym of A'^. carolinus, 

 as was first stated by E. M. Walker himself in 1909. 



Rehn and Hebard, in 1905 and 1911, mistook macropterous 

 specimens of this in.sect for X. cubensis and so recorded them. 



Morse, in 1906, repeated Scudder's incorrect records of 1896 of the 

 present species under X. palustris. 



The same year Kirby, realizing Blatchley's name A', exigmts 

 invalid, proposed as a new name Xemobius janus; this name was 

 used by Rehn in 1910 and twice by Allard in 1911. 



Specimens Examined. — 418: 185 males, 225 females, and 8 nymphs.

This insect is known from the types only, which specimens sliow 

 it to be very near N. carolinus. From that species this geographic 

 race differs in being ver>' pale in coloration, with the spots on the 

 dorsal surface of the. female abdomen greatly enlarged. The types 

 are also as robust as the largest specimens of caroliiuts before us, 

 while the ovipositor is very short.

The considerable variation in the present insect does not seem to be 

 affected by distribution, the extremes of the species before us being 

 found in both series from Brownsville, Tex., and Orizaba, Mex. The 

 greatest ovipositor length is seen to about equal the minimum found 

 in A', carolinits, though rare exceptions are found in that species where 

 the length of the ovipositor is less than even the average of the 

 present race. 



Color Xotes. — We here describe the coloration of the type. Head,

the limbs and with intermediate channel of tegmina and exposed 

 portions of wings tawny olive. Under portions of insect pale tawny 

 olive. Maxillary palpi yellowish, the extreme apex of the terminal 

 segment very narrowly marked with very dark brown. The majority 

 of the specimens from the arid and seraiarid portions of the range 

 of the insect are somewhat darker than the type, the general color 

 being vandyke brown, and in some of these individuals the occipital 

 markings described under caroJinus are faintly apparent. There 

 are verj' few brachj-pterous females from this portion of the distribu- 

 tion of the race, and all of these but one are in a poor state of 

 preservation. The specimen from Brownsville, Tex., in good condi- 

 tion, shows the color pattern of the exposed dorsal surface of the 

 abdomen similar to that of typical carolinus. 



The majority of the specimens from the state of Vera Cruz resemble 

 carolinus closely in coloration and color pattern, but are almost 

 without exception more russet. The few specimens from that region, 

 which differ from these m coloration, are colored much as in typical 

 carolinus neomexicanus, and all have the ovipositor as is typical in 

 that race. 



With scarcely an exception, the limbs of the specimens before us 

 are immaculate. The maxillary palpi have the dark marking of 

 the apex of the ultimate joint invariably exceedingly narrow. 



Distribution. — The present insect is known from the more arid 

 regions of the western United States, southward to the state of Vera 

 Cruz, Mex., and Costa Rica. The most northern localities at which 

 it has been taken are Shovel Mountain, Tex., Jemez Hot Springs^^ 

 New Mex., and Florence, Ariz. From Shovel Mountain, Tex., it is 

 found south to the Gulf coast and is checked in its eastern distribu- 

 tion by this boundary. The most southern locality is Costa Rica, 

 while it appears to be only limited in its western distribution by the 

 Pacific coast. 



Biological Notes. — All we know of the life of the present race has 

 been learned from material taken in the southwestern United 

 States. There the species appears to enjoy a wide but rather local 

 distriVjution. It was very seldom found by us in any numbers, and 

 occasional macropterous .specimens attracted to light were the usual 

 indication of the presence of the species. We have found it but once 

 in the brachypterous form, then it was not extremely scarce, but 

 verj' difficult to capture, .in low irrigated grass near the station at 



•' These specimens are intermediates between this race and typical A'', carolinus.

488 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AC.U)EMY OF [June, 



Albuquerque, New Mex. Occasional trills from this grass plot indi- 

 cated the presence of the insects in the afternoon, specmiens could 

 douljtless have been taken there with ease after nightfall. The 

 series before us suggests that the species is far more plentiful in 

 the region discussed during June than later in the season. The 

 same conditions which govern the distribution of X. cubensis mor- 

 7nonius are applicable to the present species as well. 



Synonymy. — In 1896, Scudder incorrectly recorded the series of 

 specimens of the present insect from the state of Vera Cruz, Me.x., 

 as .V. toUecus, in the same paper in which he described neomexicanus. 

 That year that name was again used by him for the same specimens 

 in his key in Psyche. 



Saussure, in 1897, finding that a species which he was describing 

 for the Biologia was the same as the present insect, corrected the 

 name in the te.xt, but accidentally left his name Xemobius denticulatus 

 as the name for the figure.

[Raleigh, N. C] 



This species, which also belongs to the subgenus Eunemohius, is 

 one of the most distinctive of the North American species of the genus 

 Nemobius. In the original description the supposed male of the 

 present species was in fact A^ macidatus, and in consequence that 

 composite description is highly misleading. There is a superficial 

 resemblance of this species to N. jmlustris, but examination shows 

 that it belongs to a different subgenus, since in confusus the disto- 

 ventral spurs of the caudal tibiaj are equal in length and the ovi- 

 positor is of the shorter type, armed at the apex above with heavy 

 teeth, below with widely spaced serrations. 



The bone-white maxillary palpi in both sexes distinguish the present 

 species from all other North American members of the genus. 

 The nearest relationship is found in A', carolinus, from which species 

 confusus differs widely in the different color pattern, much darker 

 general coloration and ovipositor which is different in shape and 

 armament. 



Based on a series of specimens from two localities in Indiana. 



Single type here designated: 9 ; Tippecanoe Lake, Kosciusko 

 County, Indiana, Augu.st 26, 1902. (Blatchley) [Blatchley Col- 

 lection]. 



Descripiion of Type. — Size small, form graceful; head small, not 

 as full and with interantennal projection not as prominent as in 

 carolinus, wider than the cephalic width of the pronotum. Alaxillary 

 j)alpi similar to those of carolinus. Eyes broad ovate, not at all 

 jirominent. Pronotum with proportions much as in carolinus, 

 narrowing slightly cephalad and with a medio-longitudinal impressed 

 line more noticeable in the cephalic portion. Teginina half as long

as caudal femora, resembling those of .V. palustris excepting that in 

 the present species the humeral vein is more conspicuous and the 

 tegmina are divided by this vein into less rounded dorsal (here 

 including the intermediate channel) and more nearly perpendicular 

 lateral fields. Wings absent. Ovipositor slightly more than half 

 as long as the caudal femora, feebly arcuate, distal third of same 

 heavy, lanceolate; with both dorsal and ventral margin-^ of apex 

 armed, the former with rather widelj' spaced, very heavy, and some- 

 what recurved teeth, the latter with widely spaced serrulations. 

 The limbs are somewhat more delicate than in caroUnus ana, the spines 

 of the caudal femora somewhat more slender than in that species.

Description of Allotype. — Smaller but very similar to female in 

 general appearance. Tegmina transparent and very delicate; of 

 same character as in caroUnus but not as nmch wider than abdomen

The extremes in size found in the material before us are given in 

 the above measurements. Although, the series are not large, it is 

 possible to see that there is but little variation in the species. The 

 eastern specimens average somewhat smaller than those from Indiana. 

 In the original description the measurements for the male sex are, as 

 has been stated, taken from a specimen of .V. maculatus, while those 

 of the female are, unfortunately, in almost every case exaggerated. 



Color Xotes. — All of the specimens before us are of very much the 

 same coloration. Head, pronotum, and tegmina shining piceous, the 

 latter transparent in the male, nearly transparent in the female. 

 Maxillary palpi with proximal segments piceous, last two segments 

 white and very striking. Dorsal surface of abdomen dark bistre: 

 in the specimens of somewhat lighter coloration, bistre with the 

 margins of the segments darker. Limbs and ventral surface of body 

 immaculate raw umber; in dark specimens mummy brown. Both 

 males and females of the present species have a very shinj- appearance. 



Distribution. — The present species has been taken on the Atlantic 

 coast from a few miles northwest of Washington, D. C, to Raleigh, 

 N. C. The only other known point of distribution is the tjTJe locality 

 in northern Indiana. 



Biological Xotes. — Among the secretive species of A^emobius, this 

 species is at present one of the least known. We learn from Blatchley 

 that it was first found, "quite common in some low, damp woods 

 bordering Tippecanoe Lake .... living among the fallen leaves 

 and beneath small chunks and chips." No macropterous specimens 

 are known, but it is probable that a long-winged form of the present 

 species exists. 



. Synonymy. — It is strange that although Blatchley found this 

 insect plentiful when the type series was taken, he apparently secured 

 no males, but having taken males of N. maculatus in the same locality, 

 unfortunately suppo.sed these to be males of the new species. 




492 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



The result is that the original description is a composite of the two 

 species. We have at present before us two males and two females 

 of the type series which bear this out fully, as the males are both 

 macidatiis. 



E. M. Walker has noted that Professor IMorse pronouncetl the 

 males of Blatchley's confusus a different species from the females, 

 but that writer incorrectly surmised that the females were proliably 

 synonymous with ^V. carolinus Scudder.

TWO COLLECTIONS OF PLEISTOCENE FOSSILS FROM THE ISTHMUS OF 

 PANAMA. 



BY .AMOS P. BROWN .\XD HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The two collections of fossils treated of in this paper were briefly 

 alluded to in our second paper on the Gatun Formation,' issued in 

 January of this j^ear. They were collected by Professor W. B. Scott, 

 1911, with the assistance of ^Ir. D. F. Macdonald, geologist of the 

 Isthmian Canal Commission. As noted in our former paper, they 

 came from two localities near the north end of the canal. 



Collection 1. — From the oyster-shell hearing layers in the Black Swamp 

 near Mount Hope {Monkey Hill). — The top of these beds is some four 

 feet above the present sea level and they are encountered in digging 

 for sewers in the town of Colon. They are also known from Toro 

 Point, across the bay from Colon. The material consists largely of 

 coral mud, with corals and coralline fragments and many moUuscan 

 remains mixed with more or less silt containing vegetable matter, 

 It was evidentl}- shipped to us just as it came from the excavations, 

 and contained the small species as they were imbedded in the mud of 

 the sea bottom. Xo volcanic ash was detected in this material. 

 While the species represented are almost all recent, some of them 

 may be extinct, and at any rate have not yet been found in the living 

 state. 



In a paper published in 1912, Dr. Dall- has described four of these 

 found in our material. Besides these four described by Dall, we 

 now add three additional new species; and a number of others were 

 among the specimens in the collection, but not in sufficiently good 

 form for description. AVe have found some of these described new 

 species in collections of recent shells in the A. N. S. P. collection, 

 and it may be that none of these new species will be found to be 

 really extinct when the raolluscan fauna of that part of the Caribbean 

 is fully known. The fauna of these beds (which Professor Scott has 

 named the Mount Hope Formation) numbers in this collection 69 

 named species of Gastropods, with 3 additional species named only 

 as to genus; 45 named species of Pelecypods, with 3 additional species 

 named as to genus; 2 Scaphopods; 6 species of corals and one 

 barnacle.

Collection 2. From the oyster-shell areas in the black, unconsolidated 

 mud, uncomformable on the Gatun Formation at the lower (north) end 

 of the Gatun Locks. — -This deposit of mud extends from a few feet 

 below sea level to about 10 feet above it at this point. The black 

 character of the deposit and the finding of definite vegetable remains 

 in it, coupled with the observation that the oj'sters grew attached to 

 mangroves or similar plants, shows that this was a deposit accumu- 

 lated at the head of a bay or in an estuarj'. From the clean condition 

 in which this material reached us, it seems likely that this collection 

 was the result of the screening of the discharge from a suction dredge. 

 This would also account for the absence of all small specuuens from 

 the collection. The species present indicate shallow, probably 

 brackish, water conditions. The most notable species is the oyster 

 (evidently growing attached to plants) and the great number of 

 Congeria shells. The oyster shells are often seen to be covered with 

 barnacles. Besides the one species of barnacle, there were three 

 species of Gastropods and five species of Pelecypods. One of the 

 Gastropods, Xeritina virgitiea Lam., has the color pattern of the shell 

 beautifully preserved. This deposit is probably more recent than 

 that at Mount Hope, but is probably, like it, Pleistocene. 



We are indebted to Mr. J. B. Henderson, of Washington, for 

 working over and determining a large part of the species listed below.

Terebra spei n. «p. Fii;. l. 



The shell is small, slender, the 

 diameter contained five times 

 in the length. Apex lost, 11 5 

 whorls remaining arc slightly 

 convex. Sculpture consists of 

 rather sharp axial ribs, narrower 

 than their concave intervals, 

 curving backward in the middle, 

 on the last whorl 22 in number, 

 and continued as far as the 

 anterior contraction; a spiral 

 groove, equally deep over ribs 

 and intervals, defines a posterior fasciole which is somewhat less than 

 one-third the width of each whorl; below this there are seven spiral 

 cords wifler than their interstices, prominent in the concave inter-

costal spaces, but almost effaced where they jjass over the crests of 

 the axial ribs. The aperture is trapezoidal; columella not plicate, 

 but its lower edge is slightly prominent. 



Length 15, diam. 3.25, length of aperture 3.3 mm.

While related to T. jwoiexta, this species differs by the convexity 

 of the whorls. 

 Drillia harfordiana var. oolonensis n. var. 



The shell reseml)les Pleuroloma harfordiana Rve. in form, but is 

 very much smaller. The anal fasciole is rather wide, concave, with a 

 single prominent spiral cord near the suture. Below the fasciole 

 there are rounded, slightly protractive axial ribs, .strongest at the 

 shoulder, rapidlj' duninishing downwards, and ten in number on the 

 penultimate whorl. They are crossed by rather widely spaced spiral 

 cords, of which three are visible on the penultimate, about a dozen 

 on the last whorl. The cords are equally developed on the ribs and 

 in their intervals, and the spaces between them are occupied by very 

 fine spiral striae, especially well developed on the fasciole. . The 

 coloration, though faded, is visible on some specimens. There is a 

 white band at the shoulder and several white lines below, on a tawTiy 

 ground. Length 12, diam. 5.5 mm.; about 9 whorls.

An allied recent form from Nicaragua is described below. 



Drillia harfordiana var. liucki n. v. 



Similar to var. colo?iensis except in the following details. The 

 axial ril)s are much more numerous, seventeen on the penultimate 

 whorl; on the last whorl they diminish \-cry rapidly below the 

 periphery, and the spiral cords are noticeably enlarged and prominent 

 on the summits of the ribs; the 6th and 7th below the shoulder are 

 white. From the shoulder to the suture the surface is buflf-white, 

 and tiie growth stria somewhat lamellar; elsewhere the shell is dark

NEW SPECIES OF THE GENUS MOHNIA FROM THE NORTH PACIFIC. 

 BY WILLIAM HEALEY DALL. 



In arranging for studj- the unequalled collection of Chrysodominae 

 of the National ^luseum, I found an unexpected number of species 

 of the genus Mohnia Friele, of which one or two species, including 

 the tj-pe, are found in the North Atlantic. Diagnoses of some of 

 the undescribed forms are appended. 

 Mohnia robusta n- sp. 



?>hell solid, stout, of about eight whorls, the apical ones being 

 always eroded in adult shells; the upper whorls with 1.5-16 axial, 

 rounded, little elevated, nearly straight riblets, which become feebler 

 and finally vanish on the last whorl; suture appressed, slightly 

 constricted; other axial .sculpture of rather irregular, retractively 

 arcuate incremental lines; spiral sculpture of obscurely channelled 

 grooves which become wider with age and on the penultimate whorl 

 are about 11 in number; on the last whorl they are coarser on the 

 base, but nowhere sharp or clean cut; the whole .surface is covered 

 with a dark olive periostracum, under which the shell is white; 

 aperture ovate, the bodj- erased white, the pillar gj'rate but not 

 pervious, the outer lip thin, sharp; the canal rather wide and strongly 

 recurved. The nucleus is not preserved on any of the specimens. 

 The operculum is dark horn color and forms about one whorl. Length 

 of iy\ye specimen (about five whorls) 36.5; of last whorl 25; maximum 

 diameter 15 mm. 



Bering 8ea in 987 fathoms, off the Pribiloff Islands. 

 Hohnia corbis '•■■ sp. 



Shell with the apex eroded and about five rounded whorls remain- 

 ing; white, covered with an olivaceous yellow periostracum; suture 

 appressed; axial sculpture of numerous, rather irregular, prominent 

 incremental lines; spiral sculpture of, between the sutures, about 

 seven cord-like ridges, which on the last whorl become flatter and 

 strap-like; the interspaces are irregular, but usually wider; between 

 the cord at the shoulder and the suture behind there is a flattish 

 space with four or five ob.solcte finer spirals; contrary to custom, the 

 base of the last whorl and canal have no spiral sculpture; aperture

.short-oval, the outer lip thin, short, the lunly erased white, the 

 pillar gyrate and minutely pervious; canal very short, wide, and 

 slightly recurved; operculum with a small subspiral nucleus. Length 

 of shell 31; of last whorl 20; maximum diameter 14 mm. 

 Bering Sea, off the Pribiloff Islands in 1,771 fathoms. 



Mohnia vemalis n. sp. 



Shell small, thin, white under a light green periostracum, of about 

 seven whorls; the apex apparently blunt, but always more or less 

 eroded; the nepionic whorls with a few spiral grooves, the following 

 whorl or two with about 16 rather prominent short ribs, most promi- 

 nent at the periphery, with narrower interspaces crossed by fine 

 spiral strise with wider interspaces; the ribs rapidly become obsolete 

 and on the last three whorls are absent, the surface being then only 

 marked by very arcuate incremental lines, the strise becoming obso- 

 lete, except on the base near the canal where there are a few coarse 

 spirals; aperture short-ovate, the outer lip thin, sharp, the body 

 erased, the canal short, wide, slightly recurved, the pillar gyrate,, 

 minutely pervious; the operculum with a subspiral nucleus. Length 

 of five whorls (the apex being eroiled) 21 ; of last whorl 14; maximum 

 diameter 10 mm. 



Off Tillamook Bay, Oregon, in 7S6 fathoms. 



Hohnia siphonoides n sp- 



Shell solid, rotund, white, with an olivaceous polished periostracum, 

 and with aljout sLx whorls; apex eroded, apparently blunt; sculpture 

 of faint incremental lines and sparse zigzag obsolete ridges recalling 

 those of Tri(o7iofu$us hypolispits Dall, but less distinct; whorls 

 rather flatfish, aperture ovate; outer lip slightly reflected, body with 

 a thin layer of callus, pillar gyrate, not pervious, canal short, recurved. 

 Operculum with a small subspiral nucleus. Length (eroded) 34; 

 length of last whorl 26; maximum diameter 1.5 mm. 



Bering Sea, off Pribiloff Islands, in 987 fathom^. 



If it were not for the operculum, this shell would certainly i)e 

 referred to Tritonofitnus. 



Mohnia exqaisita <>. *^l'. 



Shell delicate, white under a grcenisi. periostracum. with about 

 seven whorls; suture not appressed; axial sculiiture of incremental 

 lines which cut the spiral keels and minutely serrate their edges 

 occasionally; spiral sculpture, fundamentally of two prominently 

 elevated keels; one at the shoulder recurved, the other vertical to 

 its ba,se; with ten or twelve not jirominent spiral conls on the base. 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. -503 



In one specimen the space between the keels has no spiral sculpture, 

 in another there are one or two minor keels and numerous faint 

 spirals; this specimen also has a minor keel marginating the base. 

 Aperture rather small, the outer lip sharp, thin, modified by the 

 keels; inner lip era.sed, white; pillar gyrate, minutelj- pervious; canal 

 short, wide, hardly recurved. Operculum with subspiral nucleus 

 and much transparent enamel on the margin of the [jroximal surface.

 lines which are not conspicuous; aperture roundedTfiuadrate, the 

 outer lip thin, sharp, the body era.sed, the pillar gyrate, minutely 

 pervious; canal .short, wide, recurved; operculum with a subspiral 

 nucleus. Length of (eroded) .shell 38; of last whorl 27; maximum 

 diameter 19 mm. 



Off Hondo, Japan, in 905 fathoms. 



This would certainly be taken for an immature Biicrinuiii if it 

 were not for the operculum. 

 Mohnia japonica ". ><i'. 



Shell small, polished, white under a dark green periostracum, the 

 apex eroded, but having apparently about sLx whorls; the first intact 

 whorl shows faint indications of obsolete ribbing, the later whorls

 microscopic spiral striie; on the base there are the usual spiral threads 

 near the canal. Aperture elongate-ovate, outer lip thin, sharp; 

 liody erased, canal .short, wide, recurved, axis gyrate, not pervious.

 Mohnia hondosnsis n. s)i. 



Shell small, of about six whorls, whitish, covered by an olivaceous 

 periostracum; first two whorls denuded, the next with a peripheral 

 carina and about ten ribs which are prominent only at the periphery, 

 and as well as the carina become obsolete on the last whorl; there

1913.1 NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 505 



SEPTILES COLLECTED BY THE YALE PERUVIAN EXPEDITION OF 1912. 

 BY THOMAS BARBOUR. 



Dr. Hiram Bingham ha.s .sent me two small lots of snakes, nine 



specimens in all, from Machu Pichu, 9,000-10,000 feet altitude, 



Department of Cuzeo, Southern Peru. They were collected by 



Dr. George P. Eaton and IMr. Ellwood C. Erdis. Four species are 



represented, of which two are new. The types of the new species 



have been studied by Dr. A. G. Ruthven, and the description of one 



of them appears under his name. The other he returned, since he 



had no material of the genus Drepanodon for direct comparison, and 



since the Yale specimen had its teeth badh' broken he was loath to 



describe it. I have, however, a .specimen of D. anomahis Jan., 



which I obtained in Bolivia, and am enabled to make quite sure, 



I think, that the second specimen represents an undescribed species 



of this genus. The fact that Dr. Ruthven was leaving for South 



America on a collecting trip, and the desirability of reporting on this 



material at once, has led me to describe one species myself with 



Dr. Ruthven's consent, and to include his description of the other 



with n\y own. Dr. Bingham has kindly added these specimens to 



the Reptile Collection of the Museum of Comparative Zoologj'. 



Atractas'badins (Boio). 



Boie, Isis, 1S27, p. 540. 



Boulenger, Cat. Sn. B. M., 2, 1894, p. 308. 



Four specimens from Machu Pichu. In squamatioii those all fall 

 within the limits indicated by Boulenger (I.e.). In coloration, 

 however, they do not agree quite so well. It is also noteworthy that 

 these four examples from the same locality are exactly alike in 

 pattern and shade of color. They are pale reddish-brown above, 

 with more or less irregular darker blutches above which have a 

 tendency to fall into alternating series upon the dorsal region. The 

 ventral surface is covered with blotches of br()wnish-l:)lack, many 

 of which are often confluent. This coloration comt)ines some of the 

 characters described by Boulenger for what he calls var. B. and C. 

 Nevertheless, it is quite different and may be confined to specimens 

 from this part of Peru. If this turns out to be the case, it will l)c 

 advisable to name this race.

Type, Mus. Comp. Zool., No. 8,829, from Machu Pichu, Peru, 1912; 

 collected by the Yale Peruvian Expedition of that year. 



Head rather distinct from neck; eye moderate, with vertically 

 elliptical pupil. Body quite strongly compressed; scales smooth, 

 no apical pits, in nineteen rows; ventrals 198, rounded; anal un- 

 divided; subcaudals in 64 pairs. Rostral broader than high, just 

 visible from above ; nostril in the suture between two nasals ; frontal 

 longer than broad, almost triangular, the apex being directed back- 

 ward; loreal not conspicuously small, almost a rectangle; one 

 prse- and two postoculars; temporals 2 -|- 3; eight upper labials, of 

 which the fourth and fifth enter the eye; four lower labials in contact 

 with the anterior chin shields, which are about equal in length to the 

 posterior pair. 



In color the head is black, with an incomplete collar interrupted 

 on the nape (red in life undoubtedly and white in spirits). The 

 body is crossed by twenty-seven l)road black bands, which are about 

 twelve scales wide dorsally and much more narrow ventrally, usually 

 covering but four ventrals. The result is an equal number of inter- 

 spaces, wide below and narrow dorsally, which are white in spirits 

 (probably also red in life). There are numerous black spots in the 

 white (red?) areas dorsally and a few in the lateral interspaces. 

 Ten black rings upon tail, including the tip, which is black, the 

 interspaces being very narrow. 



Named for Mr. EUwood C. Erdis, who, with Dr. Eaton, collected 

 these specimens. 

 Orepanodon eatoni Ruthven sp. nov. 



Type, Mus. Comp. Zool., No. 8,831, froni Machu Pichu, Peru, 

 1912; collected by the Yale Peruvian E.xpedition of that year. 



"There are 12-13 small maxillary teeth subequal or slightly in- 

 creasing in length, followed after a short interspace by two enlarged 

 and compressed teeth. Mandibular teeth subequal. Head distinct 

 from neck; eye moderate with vertically elliptic pupil. Boily a 

 little compressed; .scales smooth and without pits, in fifteen rows 

 throughout; ventrals 165, rounded. Tail moderate, subcaudals in 

 32 pairs; anal plate entire. Rostral normal, just visible from above; 

 two nasals; frontal slightly broader than long, with an obtuse angle 

 posteriorly; loreal very small and low; preoculars 1 and 2; post- 

 oculars 2; temporals 12 and 2-2; upper labials 7, third and fourth 

 beneath the eye; 7 lower labials, four in contact with the anterior

chin shields, which are of about the same length as the posterior 

 pair. 



"Anteriorly the back is crossed by black bars about 4 scales broad, 

 which are imperfectly continued on the sides of the belly and mostly 

 interrupted on the median line. Toward the middle of the body 

 the lateral parts of the bars tend to become displaced to form a 

 pattern of alternating blotches, which are sometimes connected on 

 the lower part of the sides. Near the tail the black markings are 

 again united into cross bars and on the tail again broken up into 

 alternating spots. The interspaces are about 3 scales wide, and 

 scales are mostly pale (reddish in life?) , relieved b\- small pale brown 

 lines or spots and generally a poorly defined dark brown spot or line. 

 There is an irregular light collar, from which a poorly defined con- 

 tinuation extends on the temple. Sides of head with pale mark; 

 chin much spotted with black. 



"It will be noted that the characters of this snake are not exactly 

 the same as those ascribed to the genus Drepanodon. The principal 

 differences from the other species are the slightly greater number 

 of maxillarj- teeth and the .shape of the body, but the writer believes 

 that the forms have enough in common to make it advisable to refer 

 the species tentatively to this genus." 



The collection also contains a single paratj-pe of this species.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SYNONYMY OF SERPENTS IN THE FAMILY 

 ELAPID5:. 



BY JOSEPH C. THOMPSON, SURGEON, T. S. N. 



In Mr. Ruthven's epoch-making monograph. Variations and Ge- 

 netic Relationships of the Garter-snakes, one reads: "An exammation 

 of the systematic work that has been done upon the snakes shows, 

 as might be expected, that it is largely analj-tical in its nature, being 

 for the most part descriptive of the existing diversities" ;' and a little 

 further along, he adds: "After analysis, therefore, as has been said, 

 comes the need of a larger synthesis." - 



The first step in the sj-nthetic work is the reexamination of speci- 

 mens that have been made the types of new species. This note calls 

 attention to five that should be stricken from the list of valid species.

 The subspecies of Peters, which was later promoted to the rank of 

 a species, is based upon a cobra that is normal in every respect, with 

 the exception that the supralabials arc reduced from seven to six. 

 This is brought about by the fusion of the normal third and fourth 

 shields. As the result of this two more characters become altered: 

 there is but one labial, the fused shield, entering the eye, and the 

 rostral shield becomes a trifle wider. Four si)ccimens from Samar 

 have been examined at the United States National Museum and at 

 the Senckenberg Museum. In these specimens the rostral and the 

 supralabial shields were normal, the scale count averaged twenty-one

rows on the neck and nineteen on the bodj', the gastrosteges one 

 hundred sixty-nine, the urosteges fifty, and the total two hundred 

 nineteen. 



In the Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum there is a full 

 page of synonymy for Naja tripudians, followed by the remark: 

 "This species, as here understood, varies very considerably, and the 

 forms enumerated hereafter might be regarded as distinct species but 

 for the absence of any sharp demarcation-lines between them." 

 Instead of this serving as an object lesson of the futility of the en- 

 deavor to divide a complex and variable species such as the cobra 

 into endless subspecies, labor is still being expended. 



The present vogue is to arrange the cobras in an arithmetical series, 

 calculated from the number of ventral and subcaudal shields or from 

 the sum of both. AVhere a gap in the series is discovered (which gap 

 B regularly due to lack of sufficient material), there to boldlj' draw a 

 line between this and that subspecies. On one occasion no demarca- 

 tion-lines whatever were needed to reestablish a subspecies. We 

 learn ^ that the variety leucodira comes from Sumatra and sputatrix 

 from Java. The distinguishing characters of the two are presented 

 in tabular form: 



In other words, this table shows: 



Sumatran specimens to be characterized by having at times two 

 scale rows le.ss on the neck, two less on the body, ten more gas- 

 trosteges, and two more urosteges than some Javan specimens. 



Javan specimens to be distinguishable by occasionally having two 

 more scale rows on the body, eleven gastrosteges less, and two uro- 

 steges less than some Sumatran specimens. 



As a matter of fact, when two groups of animals require to be defined 

 in terms of this nature, it really means that they belong to the .same 

 species, and that the only tangible difference between them is to be 

 found on the locality label.

Major ^^'all mentions two specimens as having the last ventral

 degree in Asiatic Elapidae. 



The local name aka-maia, signifying "red-death", is a simple 

 reference to the color and the dangerous nature of the beast. The 

 mata element of the phrase is the Malayo-Polynesian root form mean- 

 ing "death", and is used in this connection from Madagascar in the 

 west to Hawaii in the east.

 Female; total length 220, tail 20 mm. 



This synonym is based upon a specimen that was purchased from 

 a dealer in Japan. The description or the type does not mention any 

 character by which it may be distinguished from a normal Calliophis 

 macclellandii; the diagnosis, which is an epitome of the description, 

 reads, "Similar to Calliophis macclellandii, but with more numerous 

 gastrosteges and urosteges; the sum of the gastrosteges and urosteges 

 always more than 256." 



The distribution of Calliuphis macclellandii is from northern India 

 to Formosa. It belongs to a group in which a particularly wide 

 range in the number of vertebriB frequently occurs in the same species. 

 If the records be tabulated, one may see at a glance the following 

 data:

If this data be plotted on squared paper, ilue regard being taken of 

 the gastrostege and the urostege count, an instructive diagram will 

 result. The solid dots repre.sent mainland and the circles island 

 specimens; where the sex has been recorded there is added the con- 

 ventional sign. 



Observations along the.se lines are of interest when carried out as 

 studies in geograi)hical variation, but when they become the basis of 

 new species nothing l)ut confusion will eventually result. 



The point that these tables really make clear is that the island 

 specimens differ from those of the mainland in having an increased 

 number of vertebrse. This is a well-known phenomenon, and it occurs 

 in almost all the species of C'olubrime, Xajidae, anil Crotalinie tiiat 

 inhabit both the mainland of Asia and the adjacent island arcs. 



To cstai)lish ('. swinhoci involved the following procedure: From 

 the records of twelve mainland and five island specimens, seventeen 

 in all, certain additions and subtractions were made, and a difference 

 of four vertebrip in a range of si.\ty-four, equivalent to (ii%, was 

 discovered. This Gj^'o variation in a single character was added to 

 the locality label, and the sum was a new species. 



Where the same specie^ iidiabit-; the mainland and an ailjacent

island, and where but a few examples are studied from each locality, 

 it is but the application of the most elementary arithmetic to dem- 

 onstrate that a small gap exists lietween the two groups. AVhere these 

 two groups are recognized in taxonomy, and where the series increases 

 and the gap disappears, then but one criterion is left by which the 

 determination of a specimen may be accomplished — namely, the 

 locality label.

There are nearly forty species of Elap.s. and all have seven supra- 

 labials. There is no genus of anything like this size with so uniform 

 a count. The reduction to six supralabials seen in this specimen is 

 caused l)y the fusion of the normal first and second; this fused shield 

 shows on its lower margin an indenture and a very short suture ex- 

 tending upward. The reduction in the number of infralabials is due 

 to the fusion of the normal first and second; the right shield has a 

 short incisure from the oral rim. These dents and short sutures 

 indicate the position of the normal line of separation. The temporals 

 are irregular; the anterior shield on the right side being fused with all 

 the lateral cephalic shields as far back as the last labial; the jiosterior 

 temiioral on the left .side is fused with the shield that normally inter- 

 venes between it and the azygos plate behind the i^arietals.

 the iu)rmal shields fused and others not comiiletely divided.

FISHES FROM THE MADEIRA RIVER, BRAZIL. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



The fishes described in the present paper were collected by Mr. 

 Edgar A. Smith, in 1912 and 1913. They were secured at various 

 localities along the Madeira River or in its tributaries during Mr. 

 Smith's last trip to Brazil. As natural history was but an inci- 

 dental feature of the journey, and opportunities for collecting being 

 ver\- limited, Mr. Smith was fortunate in securing an interesting 

 collection. The specimens are all small. A number of the species 

 appear to be undescribed, or possibly hydrographieal forms of their 

 allies. As very few species have previoush' been recorded from the 

 Madeira River, the present account is offered as a contribution to 

 Brazilian ichthyology. The Academy is indebted to Mr. Smith 

 for the gift of the collection to its museum. The accompanying 

 figures are all drawn to scale, the line given with each one expressing 

 millimeters.

 of the Madeira River near Porto Velho. January and February, 

 1913. In color they are pale uniform browniish. without sixits or 

 other markings. The singular v">^ctoral fin of those specimens fir?t 

 attracted my atttnition. as it is com}>ose<i of a rather long basal 

 fleshy lobe surrounded by the rays, which are given out from all 

 sides, except in front. That these specimens are identical with the 

 present species appears to me unquestionable. This is of importance 

 as two recently proposetl genera are therefore very likely parallel 

 cases. I refer to Archeciiejr Eigeiimann and Dcrnwtocheir Durbin. 

 Archeicheir is thus doubtless a synonym of the earlier (_bv page

 the short account will permit of comparison. Villa Bella specimens 

 are described as having the color of the caudal faint, a duskiness ex- 

 tending upon lower caudal lobe, and humeral spot not well defined.

The Collecting and Preparation of Diatoms. — Mr. T. Chalklev

 diatoms, deplored the threatened extinction of the amateur, esi)ecially 

 in brandies of science involving the u.se of the microscope. He men- 




•1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 581 



tioned illustrious amateurs, both living and dead, whose work has 

 added greatly to our knowledge of nature. 



The abundance of diatoms in clear waters was indicated, and ap- 

 paratus useful in making collections were exhibited and described. 

 Methods of separating diatoms into pure condition were explained 

 in outline, and those depending on motile activity were emphasized 

 as preferable in many cases to chemical treatments and laborious 

 decantations. Sedentary forms, such as Synedra, growing on algae, etc., 

 may often be separated by exposing the gathering to sunlight, when 

 the diatoms fall off the buoyant mass and deposit as a perfectly 

 ■clean layer on the bottom of the bottle. Filamentous forms may 

 usually be cleaned by gentle agitation in distilled water, e.xposure 

 to sunlight causing flotation, and by other similar means. Motile 

 forms, if in gelatinous aggregates, as Cyrnbella, Gomphonema, are put 

 into a Petri dish with distilled water and permitted to wander out of 

 the unpromising aggregate into thin films or pure groupings on the 

 bottom of the vessel. Uneriual lighting of the dish will generally 

 cause preponderant groupings toward the light. The clean frustules 

 are transferred to watch-glasses of distillecl water, working with a 

 ■capillary pipette and low-power binocular microscope. Tenacious 

 or leathery layers of Nitzschia, on stones in rapid waters, are cut off 

 with a knife, and after freeing from detachable mud are left in a 

 small flat bottle of distilled water for 24 hours. The diatoms expand 

 •on the upright glass walls, especially upon the lighted side, into thin, 

 coherent films of great purity, detachable with a sharp needle or 

 similar instrument. Larger Naviculse not coherent, but aggregated 

 in patches on the bottom of a spring, are lifted with as little mud as 

 possible, and separated from organic and inorganic flocculence in 

 the same bottle; and a separation in course of Pinnularia, was 

 •exhibited, in which the large frustules could be seen, with the aid of 

 a pocket lens, expanding on the glass. 



Distilled water, if well aerated and uncontaminated with metals, 

 especially copper, seems to stimulate the desired activities. The 

 'diatoms having been segregated by .such means, they are transferred 

 with a capillary pipette to a clean cover-glass, dried and burned to 

 whitene.ss. The glass is supported on a thin piece of jilatinum, 

 which in turn rests on a piece of fireclay ground flat. The fireclay 

 Is heated to bright redness with a gas burner, the platinum showing 

 only a faint glow. In about fifteen minutes the frustules are free 

 from organic matter, and the mount may be made in the usual way 

 with Canada balsam or styrax. 



The biological method of cleaning, apart from its facility in handling 

 sparse or unpromising material, gives opportunity for interesting 

 observations on the living diatoms. 



On Diatoms of Philndelphia. — Mr. Charles S. Boyer described 

 the diatomaceous flora of Philadelphia, stating that he was able to

The entire flora of the city and immetliate vicinity numbers 

 probably three hundred distinct species. Illustrations of many 

 diatoms were shown, including some of those found in the citj' water 

 supply. 



The Critical Point in Liquids. — Mr. Hugo Bilgram remarked that 

 of the various inclusions found in quartz those of liquid dioxide of 

 carbon are amoiig the most interesting. Within more or less irregular 

 microscopic cavities are inclosed three distinctly visible fluids: 

 water, liquid dioxide, and within this a bubble of dioxide vapor. 

 When the temperature is raised, the liquid dioxide is turned into 

 vapor and the bubble disappears. Upon cooling the object, the 

 vapor bubble suddenly reappears. In many cases not a single, but 

 a number of bubbles make their appearance, making it look as if 

 the inclusion were boiling. How is this phenomenon to be explained? 



It is well known that water boils when heated to 100 degrees 

 Celsius; but if exposed to a reduced pressure, its injiling point is 

 lower, and if exposed to a pressure higher than that of the atmos- 

 phere, the boiling point is higher. If the relation of the vapor 

 pressure to the temperature is represented by a curve, it can be seen 

 that at a point somewhat over 300 degrees the pressure curve extends 

 to infinity. This shows that al)ov(> this temperature water cannot 

 exist in liquid form, no matter how high the pressure, and this degree 

 of heat is termed the "critical i)oint." 



All volatile li(|ui(ls show the same peculiarity, but the critical 

 point is (litTerent for different liquids. That of dioxide of carbon 

 is in the neighborhood of 28 degrc'es Celsius, and the jihenomena 

 above described i)resent the change of dioxide of carbon from the 

 li(|uiil to the gaseous state and vice rcrxa at a temiM-rature which is 

 near tiie critical ]ioint. From the (leculiar features of the i)henomena 

 very interest iiiu: inferences can be derived. 



There is a sharp distinction between fluids and gases, as we know 

 them, the jirincipal ditTerences being in relation to elasticity, cohe- 

 sion, and expansion by heat. While gases are highly compressible 

 anil have a high coeflicient of exi)ansion by h(>al. compressibility 

 of li(|uids is very slight and expansion by heat not very great. While 

 gases readily exi)anil if the sjiace of their confinement is increa.sed, 

 liquids maintain their volume. In gases there is a total ai)sence of 

 cohesion, while in the case of liiiuids the molecules c()her(>. When 

 water or any other li(iuid is converted into steam, the change from 

 the liquid to the vajior state is abni])t. But the i)henomena exhibited 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 583 



by the dioxide inclusions indicate that when a liquid is heated to its 

 critical point and is finally converted into a gas, it gradually passes 

 from one to the other state. A slight rise in temperature causes the 

 inclosed buljhles rapidly to diminish in size, indicating a high expansion 

 coefficient of the liquid portion. After the bubbles have disappeared, 

 a further advance of temperature does not burst the walls of the cavitj', 

 showing the liquid to be compressible. In cooling, the bubble or 

 bubbles suddenly appear of a definite size instead of growing from a 

 mere point. Before that moment the contents of the cavity are 

 no doubt in a liquid condition, otherwise bubbles could not be seen. 

 By cooling the prevailing high pressure is reduced until it falls below 

 the vapor pressure of the dioxide corresponding to the temperature, 

 and there is a tendency to form a small bubble. But its formation 

 is resisted by the cohesion of the molecules. Only after the pre- 

 vailing pressure has been lowered so much that the excess of the 

 vapor pressure is competent to overcome cohesion will a sudden 

 rupture take place, attended by an instantaneous" reduction of the 

 volume of the liquid due to the sudden increase of pressure. This 

 accounts for the sudden appearance of bubbles at a definite size. 

 We can therefore conclude that a liquid, when near its critical point, 

 is in a state that is intermediate between the licjuid and the ga.seous 

 states.

NOTES ON THE GEOLOGY OF THE ISLAND OF ANTIGUA. 

 BY AMOS P. BROWN, Ph.D. 



During parts of July and August, 1913, I made a visit to the 

 island of Antigua in the hope of finding a place where the Oligoeene 

 fauna of the rocks of the island would be in a condition to per- 

 mit of exten.sive collection. I was in hopes that the fossils would 

 be found in incoherent or soft material as I found them at Panama 

 and as Gabb found them in Santo Domingo. With this in view, I 

 made a rather close examination of practically all places from which 

 fossils had been obtained that were known to the local naturalists 

 of the island. Three weeks were spent on the island and many 

 localities were visited. In this search I was aided by Mr. W. R. 

 Forrest, a resident of St. John's, and by Mr. H. A. Tempany, Super- 

 intendent of Agriculture of the Leeward Islands, also of St. John's. 

 To both of these gentlemen I was indebted for many courtesies, and 

 each of them acted as my guide to localities on several occasions. 

 I was not successful in finding any place where the fossiliferous 

 deposits were in a condition permitting of the ready extraction of 

 the specimens, although from what I was able to observe the fauna 

 represented is a large one. 



The island of Antigua lies in latitude 17° to 17° 10' north and 

 between longitude 61° 40' and 61° 55' west of Greenwich. It lies in 

 the outer row of calcareous islands in the Leeward group, which 

 comprises eastern Guadaloupe (Grande Terre), Marie Galantc, 

 Antigua, Barbuda, St. Bartholomew, St. Martins, Anguilla and 

 Sombrero. It measures about Oj miles from north to south and 

 12 miles from cast to west, with a coast-line of some 70 miles and an 

 area of 108 square miles. The shape of the island is roughly trape- 

 zoidal or nearly triangular, the coast-line is deeply indented by bays 

 on the northeast and east sides, with Willoughby Bay at the southeast 

 corner, English and Falmouth Harbors on the south coast, and 

 Morris Bay, Five Islands Harbor and St. John's Harbor on the west 

 side. Numerous smaller bays and roadsteads have received names 

 and are used by the coasting boats calling at points along the south 

 and west shores. The surface of the island is roughly divided into 



i 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 585 



three regions by the Central Plain, which extends diagonall}' across 

 the island from St. John's Harbor in the northwest to Willoughby 

 Bay in the southeast ; a region that is generally flat and at no great 

 elevation above the sea, but with several hills rising from the plain 

 to an altitude of 200-350 feet. To the northeast of this Central 

 Plain is the marl or limestone belt, a region of undulating land 

 at a somewhat higher elevation than the Central Plain (150-200 feet), 

 with hills rising to 250 up to 350 feet; and in the southeast, in St. 

 Philip's Parish, to an elevation of above 400 feet. To the southwest 

 of the Central Plain is the more mountainous part of the island, the 

 distinctly volcanic portion, where the hills rise to an elevation in 

 some cases of more than 1000 feet. The highest of these hills is 

 Boggy Peak, with an elevation stated as 1360 feet, and several others, 

 as Bottle Peak and McNish Mountain, reach 1000 feet. These hills 

 are of volcanic materials and show, as Spencer points out, the erosion 

 features of a mountain plateau region, -with narrow ridges separating 

 the valleys. No distinct volcanic cone exists in this part of the 

 Island, but several hollows in the hills have been described as volcanic 

 craters. It is doubtful if any crater is still in a recognizable state in 

 the island. The hills around Five Islands Harbor are of the same 

 volcanic materials as those in the southwest of the island, but here 

 again there is no definite crater, unless indeed the basin of the harbor 

 represent such a one. Southwest of the Central Plain the ground 

 is too hilly to allow of large continuous cultivations such as are found 

 in the Central Plain and in the limestone country to the northeast, 

 and in this volcanic portion extensive cultivation has been largely 

 abandoned, although the woods have been mostly cut off for fire wood. 

 The rest of the island is and has been under cultivation for a long 

 period niostlj' in sugar cane, and, like all of these sugar-producing 

 islaiuls, the land is held by large estates. The only considerable 

 town is the capital, St. John's, where there is a hotel. Access to 

 outlying localities must be had mainly by driving. In this way I 

 visited points along the coast and certain places in the interior. 

 Such localities as could be reached bj' walking from St. John's were 

 also visited. As the Island is not large, the three weeks spent at 

 St. John's enabled me to visit most of the localities where fossils were 

 likely to be met with. I was also able to examine collections of the 

 rocks of the island at the office of Mr. Tempany, and Mr. Forrest 

 presented me with specimens of the landshells and some fossils. 

 To compare with the marine shells found in the soil of the Central 

 Plain, collections were made of the marine fauna along the shores 

 39 




586 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV., 



of St. John's Harbor and north to Corbizon Point. The hmd shells 

 now living in the island were collected (when encountered) for 

 comparison with the faunas of neighboring islands, but this collection 

 is probably not complete. Upon the field notes and observations 

 on the geology the following description of the geology of Antigua 

 is based. 



The first notice of the geology of the island of Antigua ajipeared 

 in 1819 as a preliminary paper in the American Journal of Science,^ 

 by Dr. Nicholas Nugent, of Antigua, but this was followed two 

 years later by a fuller paper by Dr. Nugent, entitled, "A Sketch of the 

 Geology of the Island of Antigua,"- published in the Transactions 

 of the Geological Society of London. 



Dr. Nugent's paper was communicated to the Geological Society 

 on November 5, 1819, and was accompanied by a collection of rocks 

 and fossils to illustrate the paper; of which collection the fossil corals 

 have been studied about forty years after their presentation by 

 P. Martin Duncan. The mollusks have never been worked over and 

 a list of the species published. Later, in 1839, Professor S. Hovey, 

 of Yale and Amherst Colleges, visited the island, and with Dr. Nugent 

 as guide, examined some of the principal localities. Upon his return 

 to America he published a paper' on the "Geology of Antigua," 

 compiled, as he himself states in this communication, from Nugent's 

 "Sketch" and from a paper by Dr. Thomas Nicholson, written 

 for the Antigua Almanac and Register. Dr. Nugent divides the 

 geological formations of the island into four, of which the basal 

 member. No. 1, is described as "trap and trap-breccia," No. 2 is 

 "stratified conglomerate," No. 3 is "chert," and No. 4 is "marl 

 or calcareous rock. " In his maps he reverses the order of the " strati- 

 fied conglomerate" and the "chert," but explains in the Appendix* 

 that this was a mistake, although he at one time entertained this 

 view of the structure of the island. Dr. Nugent's paper, which shows 

 keen observation, remained for long the classic on Antiguan geology, 

 until the appearance of AI. J. C. Purves's Geological Sketch of the

 island of Antigua in his "Ob.servations on the Geology of the West Indian Islands,

island of Antigua, wliich was published in 1885, in the Bulletin 

 du Mitsee Royal d'Hifitoire Naturelle de Belgique." This paper by 

 M. Purves is much fuller than that by Nugent, and he distinguishes 

 more divisions in the geological formations. The divisions of 

 M. Purves are as follows: 



H. Horizontal marls. 



G. Upper limestones and marls. 



F. Upper tuffs. 



E. Lacustrine or fresh-water chert. 



D. Volcanic sands and sandstones. 



C. Lower limestone or marine chert 



B. Lower stratified tuffs. 



A. Porphyrites and volcanic agglomerates. 



Of these "A. Porphyrites and volcanic agglomerates" is the 

 No. 1 of Nugent, "trap and trap-breccia" ; "B. Lower stratified tuffs" 

 is the "stratified conglomerate" No. 2 of Nugent; C, D, E, and F, 

 of Purves come in the "chert " of Nugent No. 3, who did not recognize 

 any distinction between the marine and the fresh-water cherts; 

 while divisions G and H of Purves are included in the "marl or 

 calcareous beds," No. 4 of Nugent. Indeed, it is rather doubtful 

 if Nugent recognized the horizontal marls at all. This paper of 

 M. Purves is accompanied by a geological map of Antigua, upon 

 which the divisions which he recognizes are set down, and a geological 

 section from St. Mary's Rectory to Drew's Hill and thence to Hodge 

 Bay is given to show the structure. This map indicates a fault, 

 with upthrow to the northeast and general N. W.-S. E. strike, dis- 

 locating the formations so that D, "the volcanic sands," is brought 

 to the surface and lies next to F, the "upper tuffs." This makes 

 the lacustrine or fre.sh-water cherts appear at the surface in two 

 bands traversing the island from northwest to southeast. Several 

 minor faults are shown on this map, and I observed a number which 

 have not been mapped. This fault, as indicated by Purves, runs 

 from about | mile south of Corbizon Point on the northwest coast to 

 the small bay between Isaac Point and Standfast Point which lies 

 to the southwest of Willoughby Bay at the southeast of the island. 

 It is of interest in connection with the paper by Guppy mentioned 

 below. Each of the eight divisions of the formations of the island 

 enumerated by Purves is described in detail as regards its composi- 

 tion and character, but little information is given in regard to the 



' "Esquis.se pdologiquo de I'lle d'Antigoa. " Bull. Mus. Roy. Hist. Nat. Belg., 

 Vol. Ill, 1884-85, pp. 273-318. 




588 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [XOV., 



organic remains, and that of a very general kind, only the genus 

 being noted in many cases. A short list of corals from the lower 

 marine chert and limestone, C, is given, however, which will be 

 referred to later in this paper. 



Some reference to the movements of elevation and subsidence of 

 Antigua is given in a paper by Dr. J. W. Gregory, "On the Palaeon- 

 tology and Physical Geology of the \yest Indies, "^ and a few additions 

 to the palteontology of Antigua are there noted. 



The next paper to be published dealing with the geology of Antigua 

 is by Professor J. W. AV. Spencer, "On the Geological and Physical 

 Development of Antigua"' which appeared in 1901. This gives a 

 revision of the formations of the island, as follows, the basal member 

 being placed at the bottom: 



8. Recent deposits, raised beaches. 



7. Ca.ssada Garden gravels. 



6. Friars Hill series, pebbles and marl. 



5. Hodge's Hill calcareous sandstones. 



4. White limestone or Antigua formation. 



3. Tuffs and included marls and chert. 



2. Seaforth lunestone. 



1. Igneous basement. 



Comparing this with the divisions as recognized by Purves, given 

 above, the first division, 1, corresponds to his A; that is, the "igneous 

 basement" of Spencer is the "porphj-rites and volcanic agglomerates" 

 of Purves. Spencer's Seaforth limestone does not seem to liave been 

 recognized by Purves, although it doubtless exists near Seaforth; 

 and I was shown specimens from this horizon by several collectors, 

 said to have come from the base of the stratified tuffs. Spencer's 

 No. 3, "Tuffs and included marls and chert," includes divisions 

 B, C, D, E, and F of Purves, these formations occupying the "Central 

 Plain" of Antigua. Purves's division G, upper limestones and marls, 

 is the same as Spencer's No. 4, "White limestone or Antigua forma- 

 tion," and may also include his division 5, Hodge's Hill calcareous 

 sandstone. Spencer's divisions 6 and 7, "Friars Hill series" and 

 "Cassada Garden gravels," were not recognized by Purves; while 

 his division 8 is the .same as the "horizontal marl" of Purves. Upon 

 the whole, this division of the formations recognized by Spencer 

 agrees with the observations which I was able to make while on the 

 island better than do those of Purves or Nugent, although in each

case the formation described may be readily recognized. Spencer's 

 divisions seem to be more in accordance with the history of the devel- 

 opment of the island as indicated in the record preserved in the rocks. 



Spencer's paper is accompanied by a geological map of Antigua 

 upon which he has laid down his divisions 1, 3, and 4; the other 

 divisions which he recognizes being probably too local and too ill- 

 defined in outline to be mapped. No faults are shown and no 

 geological section accompanies the map. 



The latest paper upon the geology of Antigua which has appeared 

 is by R. J. Lechmere Guppy,** following an examination of the island 

 made in 1910. As Mr. Guppy states, this examination, on account 

 of his physical disabilities, was necessarily incomplete. His visit 

 to the island was to see if any trace of the "Great Antillean Disloca- 

 tion, " postulated in his paper, "Geological Connections of the Carib- 

 bean Region"" as extending from Trinidad to Sombrero and thence 

 through the northern part of the island of Haiti, was to be found in 

 Antigua. This great fault, Mr. Guppy thinks, passes through An- 

 tigua, through the Central Plain, from Willoughby Bay to St. John's 

 Harbor; the occurrence of which two bays is his principal argument 

 in favor of this fault. Purves, on his map of Antigua, indicates a 

 fault in somewhat the same position as this Great Dislocation of 

 Guppy, but the fault as shown by Purves does not take the .same 

 course, running from a little south of Corbizon Point on the northwest 

 coast, about 2 miles to the north of the fault indicated by Guppy 

 (which starts at St. John's Harbor), to a bay between Isaac Point and 

 Steadfast Point, about a mile to the west of the head of A\'illoughby 

 Bay. Moreover, the fault shown by Purves is not indicated as a 

 dislocation of great magnitude, while that of Guppy is a "Great 

 Dislocation," bringing up the "older beds" of the Antigua Formation 

 of Spencer, which, according to Mr. Guppy, "is of a very Cretaceous 

 aspect." Upon what he bases this statement is not explained, the 

 evidence of the fo.s.sils contained in this Antigua formation points 

 to its being of Oligocene age, as will be shown later. But Mr. Guppj% 

 it seems, is not a believer in the occurrence of the Oligocene in the 

 West Indies, as he remarks in this paper (p. 684) : " Even so eminent 

 a professor as J. W. Gregory has fallen into the common error of 

 mixing up the Miocene with the Eocene, and calling the result 

 'Oligocene.' " Guppy's paper does not add much data for fixing the

age of the white limestone or Antigua formation, although he 

 records having visited "a marl pit about 2 miles from St. John's" 

 with Mr. W. R. Forrest (doubtless the one on- Marble Hill, which 

 I visiteil twice, once in company with Mr. Forrest) in which he found 

 easts of Pholadomya and also of Turritella. Upon my visit to this 

 locality in company with Mr. Forrest, we were not so fortunate, 

 finding onl}- the .small, badly" preserved branching corals, common 

 in the marl everywhere, but Mr. Forrest remarked to me that Turri- 

 tellas were sometimes found here as casts, and also casts of bivalves. 

 The preservation of the fossils in these soft marls is very imperfect, 

 and secondary crystallization obscures the structure. They are 

 rarely determinable specifically. The major part of Mr. Guppy's 

 paper is taken up in discussing the "Great Dislocation," of which, 

 during my stay upon the island, I did not see any evidence; nor has 

 its presence been detected by Mr. R. W. Forrest, who has given 

 much attention to the geology of the island. 



The general succession of the formations in .\ntigua has been 

 discussed by Nugent, Purves, and Spencer, and a brief review of their 

 several arrangements of the strata has been given above and their 

 correlations indicated. From mj' own observations, a slightly differ- 

 ent arrangement has lieen deduced, as follows;

The water-deposited beds of the island are apparently all included 

 in the Oligocene and Pleistocene; the Miocene and Pliocene are 

 entirely wanting, indicating that the island was not submerged 

 during this time. But a submergence occurred at the end of the 

 Pliocene which permitted the formation of marine deposits in many 

 parts of the island. The movement of the island at present appears 

 to be upward, and the formation of salt pond and mangrove swamp 

 deposits at manj' places along the coast line is still in progress. The 

 age of the accumulation of the "igneous basement" is set down in 

 the above table as possibly Eocene, not from any fossils which it 

 contains, but because the bedded deposits of the Oligocene appear 

 to overlie it. The volcanic activity continued, however, into the 

 Oligocene during the time of the deposit of the tufTs, and the white 

 limestone itself is intersected by dykes of the igneous material. 

 The.se deposits will now be described in more detail. 



1. The Igneous Basement. 



This is what Dr. Nugent has called the "trap formation"; it is 

 M. Purves's "porphyrites and volcanic agglomerates," or the 

 " foundation rocks of the island" or "igneous basement" of Spencer. 

 I have used Spencer's term. The rocks included in this formation 

 lie to the west of a line drawn from the head of Five Islands Bay, 

 southeasterly towards English Harbor, and they lie in the southwest 

 part of the island. They are exposed along the coast from the mouth 

 of Five Islands Bay to the southwest corner of the island and thence 

 east to the head of Falmouth Harl)or. I inspected this region in 

 company with Mr. Forrest from St. John's to St. Mary's, Old Road 

 (nearly due south of St. John's), and thence along the south coast 

 to St. Mary's Rectory at the southwest extremity, and from 

 there up the west coast to St. Mary's in the Valley, and back to 

 St. John's by the Central Plain. Mr. Tempany showed me his 

 collection of these rocks, which corresponded with those seen on the 

 tri)) with Mr. Forrest. They consist of massive igneous flows and 

 subaerially deposited ashes, mainly in layers, and with many volcanic 

 agglomerates, consisting of ash and volcanic fragments held together 

 by the material of the flows. Large volcanic bombs occur in this 

 agglomerate with fragments down to fine lapilli and a.sh. The 

 flows arc mainly pyroxene andesite, often compact; and also basalt, 

 or tile same material as the pyroxene andesite with much olivine. 

 Dykes of compact andesite and basalt iuter.sect the tuffs and agglom- 

 erates. The rocks are prevailingly andesitic, and the tuff and 




592 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV., 



agglomerate is in excess of the material in the form of flows. Many 

 of the tuffs and other materials have undergone alteration, and, 

 according to the statements of IMr. Tempany, mc^tamorjihosed 

 sediments occur. Such is the Seaforth limestone as described by 

 Spencer, but specimens of this rock which I was shown in collections 

 do not show metamorphism to any considerable extent. Water- 

 deposited tuff may occur, at least near the borders of this formation, 

 and ill the tuffs of the Central Plain area I saw deposits not greatly 

 different from those observed in these igneous foundation rocks of 

 the islaml. No definite volcanic cone from which these deposits 

 came is now in existence, all the hills being much eroded and dis- 

 sected. Remnants of such cones may exist near Five Islands Bay, 

 or the bay itself may represent the site of a crater. Another remnant 

 of a crater was reported as being in existence near the southwest 

 corner of the island, but no cone exists there at present. 



2. The Seaforth Limestone. 



I did not visit the type locality of this material, and only had the 

 opjjortunity of inspecting two lots of specimens from the formation. 

 Spencer describes it as "occurring at a few points in the valleys of the 

 mountain zone" or among the rocks of the igneous basement; and 

 states that it is a compact dark gray limestone. ]\Ir. Tempany gave 

 a similar description of its appearance and occurrence, but the 

 specimen of it which he showed me in his collection was a somewhat 

 flinty rock with undoubted Orbitoides in it. Mr. CiJlie, rector of the 

 parish of St. Mary's, who resides near the southwest corner of the 

 island, showed me some pieces of a limestone frt)m S(>aforth of quite 

 a tlifferent character. It was a dark gray compact limestone, but 

 crowded with the shells of bivalves, probably oysters, that were 

 specifically undeterminable. There was nothing in either of these 

 sjjecimens to leatl me to suppose that they were okler than Oligocene, 

 while the occurrence of th(> Orhitoi.dcs, in a form not greatly different 

 from that found in the white limestone, rather pointed to tiiis age 

 for the deposit. Purves did not recognize this f^caforth limestone. 



3. Water-deposited Tvfis and Shales, with incu'dei) Makls 

 AND Cherts. 



The.se formations occupy almost the entire area of the Central 

 Plain. They include the divisions recognized by Purves under the 

 names B, Lower stratified tuffs; C, Lower limestone and marine 

 chert; D, Volcanic sands and sand.stones; E, Lacustrine and fresh- 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 593 



water chert; F, Upper tuffs. They have been placed together by 

 Spencer as one group of deposits, and while it may be possible locally 

 to recognize the divisions matle by Purves, the cherty limestones 

 of marine origin, and possibly also those of fresh-water origin, are in 

 more or less lenticular deposits and not continuous. The division 

 D of Purves, "Volcanic sands and sandstones," is locally developed 

 and underlies in some places the fresh-water cherts or the la3'('r 

 containing the fossil wood, but it does not differ very much in appear- 

 ance from some phases of B, the lower stratified tuffs. This division 

 B of Purves, the lowest member of this group of deposits, is found to 

 the west of the Central Plain, and well tleveloped along the southern 

 shore of St. John's Harbor. The beds have the appearance of a 

 buff-colored sandstone, but on close examination the fragments of 

 which it is composed are seen to be angular, not water worn, and 

 to consist of volcanic rock and feldspar. These lower beds may have 

 a higher dip than those of the Central Plain — 20°-30°, as against 

 12°-15° — and the dip is more to the north in many cases. But as the 

 higher rocks in this lower series of tuffs are encountered, the dip 

 tliminishes and becomes more northeast. At the level of the lower 

 limestone and marine chert as seen just to the south of St. John's 

 (about a mile south of the town) the tuff becomes almost white 

 from admixed kaolin, and has this lower dip of 12° N. E. It is in 

 some places soft, in others hard and compact, and almost pure white

These cherts and cherty limestones occur also at Jackass Point 

 in 8t. John's Harbor. The same character of rock, marly limestone 

 with associated flint and chert, and with corals, etc., is found in the 

 town of St. John's, and is, in fact, the material upon which the cathe- 

 dral is built. At the cathedral it is mostly chert, and the flint and 

 chert are found to the southeast of the town along the roads. Mol- 

 lusks have been reported from this chert, but no species have been 

 determined, although doubtless a considerable fauna will be found 

 in the Nugent collection when it comes to be studied. This last 

 line of this rock, which runs southeast from St. John's Cathedral, is 

 probably another layer of the marl and chert parallel to the one 

 mentioned as running from Jackass Point southeast to near the 

 sugar factory, one mile south of St. John's. 



It is seen exposed, and fragments of the flint are plentiful along 

 the roads to the southea.st of the town, south of the Botanic Station; 

 indeed, it forms some of the small hills in this section. These deposits 

 seem to be more or less discontinuous and are only to be seen where 

 the ground becomes too hilly or the soil too stony for cano culti- 

 vation. 



The "volcanic sands and sandstones," bed D, of Purves are even 

 more discontinuous. They are characteristically developed, as he 

 describes them, along the northwest sea-coast at Dry Hill and at 

 Corbizon Point, where they are overlaid by the "lacustrine chert" 

 of Purves. Traces of these "volcanic sands" are seen in some places 

 to the east of St. John's, but their horizon is only marked in some 

 places by sandy hniips and concretions in the white tufaceous rock. 

 Sands at the horizon for these "D" beds are seen in patches from 

 Corbizon Point to the southeast, into the interior of the island; but 

 that they are often wanting, as may be seen on the hills east of the 

 Botanic Station, where a continuous section of the white tuff's, some 

 with sandy modules or concretions representing the horizon of 

 "D," the "volcanic sands," is overlain by the "lacustrine chert" 

 with fresh-water shells imbedded in its mass. At the Public Ceme- 

 tery, also, the sands are wanting, only the sandy nodules mark the 

 horizon of these beds. The white tuff's above the "marine chert" 

 are sometimes partly replaced by the lenticular masses of the volcanic 

 sands, or sometimes these samls are entirely wanting. These white 

 tuffs owe their color to kaolin from the alteration of feldspar in the 

 volcanic a.sh, and are mi.xtures of ash (usually fragments of feldspar) 

 anrl kaolin. The admixture of kaolin becomes so plentiful in the 

 lijjper i)eds that the rock might i)e called either a water-deposited 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 595 



tuff or a shale; in fact, it is of much the composition of pipe-clay. 

 This is particularly true of the layers above the lacustrine chert 

 horizon, where these virtual shales become verj' white and thin- 

 bedded and are hard to distinguish, when massive, from the overlj-ing 

 marls. These are the upper tuffs of Purves, and are quarried at 

 Scotts Hill. 



When the "volcanic sands and sandstones" are typicallj' developed, 

 as at Dry Hill or at Corbizon Point, they form the base of the section. 

 They are dark reddish or purplish in color, with numerous concre- 

 tions, resembling boulders, of a somewhat harder character, and are 

 made up of volcanic sand and gravel, all water worn, with small 

 pebbles of the compact hard andesite of the igneous basement, from 

 which they are doubtless derived. They are but slightly compacted; 

 firm, but yielding readily to the pick, and crumbling easily in the 

 fingers when in detached fragments. They are overlaid by a few 

 feet of yellowish tuff conglomerate, consisting of rolled fragments 

 of a lighter color, with much green earth in minute particles, which 

 gradually passes into the impure yellowish marls with the flint 

 layers of the "lacustrine or fresh-water chert." The exposure of 

 these flinty layers at Dry Hill follows the strike of the rock for some 

 distance, and these beds at this point have furnished the following 

 section: 



Section at Dry Hill. 



5. Compact shale with plant impressions 10 ft. 



4. Hard impure limestone with two, or sometimes three, 

 layers of flint, carrying fresh-water shells; the flint layers 

 varying from one inch to four inches thick, and the fossils 

 occupj'ing about one inch thickness in each case 2 ft. 



3. Hard impure limestone without fossil layers 2 ft. 



2. Yellowish tuff conglomerate, pebbles of tuff and andesite 5 ft. 



1. Dark reddish or purplish volcanic sandstone 18 ft.-|- 



The base of the volcanic sands is not exposed at this locality nor 

 at Corbizon Point. Several small faults exist near the north end of 

 the Dry Hill exposure, one dislocates the measures about 25 ft. with 

 an upthrow to the north, and one or more nmst exist between Dry 

 Hill and ("orbizon Point, the total upthrow to the north aggregating 

 upwards of 400 fe(!t, as the same succession of beds is to be noted at 

 Corbizon Point as is given in the above .section at Dry Hill. No 

 exposures of the rock in place (;an be seen along the coast between 

 Dry Hill and Corbizon Point, the beach being flat and sandy; and 




596 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV.^ 



inland there is a salt pond, while still further inland the cane eul- 

 tivation covers all exposures. At Corbizon Point, however, the upper 

 flinty layers carry fragments of silicified wood, and this is the horizon 

 of the silicified wood for which Antigua is noted. This horizon may 

 be traced across the island by the silicified wood and to some distance 

 to the southeast by the flint and chert with the fresh-water fossils. 

 Mr. W. R. Forrest informs me that the silicified wood is in place 

 along the north shore of Willoughby Bay; but, if so, it is not this 

 layer, always supposing that the map of Purves is correct. The 

 fresh-water fossils have not been determined specifically, a list of 

 the genera found is given by Purves. Collections of them which I 

 obtained at Dry Hill are now being studied and will be reported 

 upon later. 



The silicified wood, for which the island is noted, probably all 

 comes from this horizon. It is found throughout the Central Plain, 

 especially in the central part of the island, and lies about on the 

 surface in fragments of varying sizes, although nowhere, at present, 

 are trunks of 14 feet long by one foot or more in diameter encoun- 

 tered, such as are described Ijy Dr. Nugent. These silicified woods 

 are found scattered about upon the surface, but are rarely seen 

 in situ; they are very plentiful at Bellevue and at Cassada Garden. 

 They include both Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons, but have 

 never been studied specifically. Purves mentions having found 

 stems and fruit of Chara in the beds carrying these deposits. The 

 shales at Dry Hill which overlie the fresh-water, mollusk-bearing 

 flinty layers carry fragments of leaves of palms and other vegetable 

 matter; these beds are mixtures of kaolin and volcanic ash, and, 

 while brownish or dun-colored from the admixed vegetable matter, 

 they are evidently a part of the white .shales and tuffs of the ujiper 

 layers of this division. As has been stated, these upper shales and 

 tuffs arc well exposed at Scotts Hill, some two miles to the southeast 

 of St. John's, where they are (piarried for road metal. They are 

 here hard and compact, breaking into angular fragments on exposure, 

 and wearing down, when used on the roads, to a tena<'ious clay. This 

 rock consists, as seen under the microscope, of kaolin mi.xed with 

 volcanic ash, the kaolin largely jircdoininating. It is ])artly ce- 

 mented by secondary silica from the feldsjiar of the volcanic a.sh. 

 It l)ecomes calcareous towards the to]) and passes upward into the 

 marls of the white limestone or Antigua fonnation. Indeed, when 

 it is hard and compact, this rock clo.><ely resembles the harder parts 

 of the marl, and the apiilication of an acid is often necessary to 

 distinguish it from the true marl. 



I

The total thickness of this division is upward.s of 2000 feet or more, 

 .and of this more than half is below the lacustrine flint layer; the 

 bottom of the formation is hard to define, as it is not easily dis- 

 tinguished from the bedded deposits of the basal igneous complex. 

 But of the distinctly bedded deposits, which are exposed in many 

 places and always with the same general north or northeast dip, 

 the thickness must be at least 2000 feet. The division is composed 

 of the volcanic material of the igneous basement, reworked ]:)y water, 

 and water deposited; mixed likely with other volcanic material 

 which, erupted during the deposition of these beds, fell into the 

 water; and was distributed on the sea bottom. 



As indicated above, these tuff beds, with their included marls and 

 cherts, appear to pass upward into the marls and limestones of the 

 Antigua formation without any stratigraphic break, or the Antigua 

 formation rests conformably upon them. At several places along 

 the contact of the marls with the tuffs and shales shallow wells 

 have been sunk for water, and while the contact of these two forma- 

 tions is seldom exposed, the conformable character of it is indicated 

 by these diggings. When the Antigua formation itself is found well 

 exposed near the contact, the dip of the marls is about the same as 

 that of the tuffs, and is in the same direction; that is, the marls are 

 found to dip gently at 10°-12° to the northeast in the same way as 

 the tuft's. There is certainly no indication of a fault separating the 

 two formations as sugge.sted by Mr. Guppy. The fossils of the 

 included marls and cherts, interbcdded with the tuffs and shales, 

 do not indicate any other age than Oligocene, which is the age of the 

 Antigua limestone as indicated by its fossils. But the species that 

 have been ob.scrved in the Antigua limestone are only in part the 

 same as have been determined from the tuffs and included marls 

 and cherts. These tuffs were, in i)art at least, shallow water forma- 

 tions; mud cracks and even ripple marks were observed by me in the 

 tuffs underlying the lacustrine cherts, and the presence of these 

 fresh-water deposits (the lacustrine cherts) indicates land at this 

 time. The tuffs may have accumulated rapidly when they are 

 coarse in grain, as these volcanic conglomerates which underlie the 

 fresh-water deposits, but the finer material of the thin-bedded tuffs 

 which overlie this horizon were probably slowly depositetl and in 

 water of greater depth. This was likely the case with the marls of 

 the Antigua formatioii also, in great part; although some of the 

 harder limestone beds of this deposit have the appearance of coral- 

 reef material.

4. The Antigua Formation of Spencer. 



East of a line running from near Wetherill's Point to the head of 

 Willoughby Bay the surface of the island is composed of the Antigua 

 Formation (as Spencer has named it), a white chalky or marly rock 

 with harder layers which may be properly called limestone. In the 

 cane cultivations with which the island is covered from the Central 

 Plain easterly, this formation may often be recogiiized by a pronounced 

 blackness of the soil where the marls are encountered. They are 

 often exposed in road-cuttings, or on the hillsides by artificial diggings 

 ("marl pits") for material to be used as road metal; and where soft, 

 the dip is obscure, but where more hard the same northeasterly dip 

 is seen that was so characteristic of the tuffs and shales. As soon as 

 the harder limestone layers are encountered,, they make hills with a 

 gentle easterly slope, but a steeper westerly one on the escarpment 

 side of the hill; and this harder part of the marl or the harder lime- 

 stone is often exposed upon this escarpment side of the hill in con- 

 siderable cliffs. Where the harder limestones outcrop along the 

 coast as at Wetherill Bay and Hodge's Bay along the north coast, 

 and at High Point and other places to windward along the east coast, 

 around to Willoughby Bay on the southeast coast, these harder 

 layers form sea cliffs. These harder layers, too, form in many cases 

 the capping of the hills, which are ridges with an even summit in 

 such cases. Where the dip can be seen, on such harder layers, it is 

 uniformly to the northeast, and the thickness of this Antigua for- 

 mation, as indicated by this dip, must be upwards of 1500 feet at 

 least. The harder layers have generally the same organic remains, 

 and this seems to indicate (unless the formation is faulted) that 

 there are several parallel hard layers. The fossils contained in the 

 softer marls are usually corals, in a much altered and crystallized 

 condition; the crystallization being due to the deposit of carbonates 

 (as calcite and dolomite) or to silica in the form of quartz, crystals 

 of which substance are frequently seen in the marls. The harder 

 layers are often compact limestone, sometimes nearly barren of 

 fossils, at other times crowded with organic remains. The most 

 characteristic fo.ssil in the harder layers is an Orbitoides, which has 

 been determined by T. Rupert Jones (and this determination later 

 confirmed by Dr. Lang, of the British Museum) as Orbitoirlrs mantcUi 

 Mort. This Orbiloides, in many cases, forms the bulk of the limestone, 

 and water-worn pebbles from the seashore frequently show only 

 sections of this Orbiioidcs with no other fo.ssil. But in other layers 

 are found shells of oysters, jiectens, and other jjelecypods, while in

other cases the rock is composed of masses and fragments of corals. 

 The corals of the Nugent collection were determined bj' Duncan," 

 who gives the following list of species: 



Dimcan's List of Corals in the Nugent Collection from the Antigua 

 Formation. 



Astraea crassolamellata Duncan, with the varieties magnetica. 

 pulchella, nobilis, minor, nugenli, magnifica. 

 Astrcea antiguensis Duncan. 

 AstrcEO endothecata Duncan. 

 Astrcea tenuis Duncan. 

 Astrcea barbadensis Duncan. 

 Astrcea radiata Lam., var. intermedia Duncan. 

 Astrcea costata Duncan. 

 Rhodaraa irregidaris Duncan. 

 . Alveopora dcedala Blainv., var. regularis Duncan. 

 Alveopora microscopica Duncan. 

 Alveopora fenesirata Dana. 



Of these the species Alveopora. dadcda Blainv. is common to the 

 tuffs and to the Antigua Formation. The corals collected by Pro- 

 fessor Spencer were referred to Dr. T. Wayland Vaughan for deter- 

 mination, who reported the following list: 



Trochosmilia n. sp. 



Stylophora sp. 



Stephanpcoenia sp. 



'\Astrocoenia ornata Ed. and H. 



Brachyphyllia sp. 



*Orbicella (Astrcea) crassolamellata (Duncan). 



\Orbicella cellulosa (Duncan). 



*Orbicella endothecata (Duncan). 



Orbicella sp. 



Symphyllia n. sp. 



'\Astroria polycjonalis Duncan. 



Oroseris n. sp. 



f*Alveopora regularis Duncan. 



Porites n. sp. 



Of these species, the ones marked with an asterisk (*) are in 

 Duncan's list from the white Antigua limestone, and the ones 

 markcfl with a dagger (f) are found in Duncan's list of the corals 

 in the Nugent collection from the tuffs. Dr. Vaughan recognizes 

 eight species not in Duncan's li.st. One species is common to the 

 tuffs and the white limestone (f*). As Spencer remarks, this

finding of the same species in both the tuffs and the white limestone 

 would point to their forming really but one geological unit, "although 

 characterized by great changes in the physical conditions during the 

 accumulation of the system." What has been said of the gradual 

 passage of the upper shales and tuffs into the marls and their apparent 

 conformability point to these formations forming one geological 

 unit. As to the age of the corals examined by Dr. Vaughan, he 

 notes that the coral fauna of the Antigua formation "is identical 

 with that of the lower beds of the upper Oligocene formation of 

 southwestern Georgia." 



The mollusks collected by Spencer were referred to Dr. Dall, who 

 afterwards determined one of the forms as Pecten {Chlnmys) anguil- 

 lensis Guppy, and described one as Pecten {Plagwcteniuni) gabbi 

 Dall, referred to below in the list of species in the collection made by 

 me in Antigua. 



Professor Gregorj','- lists two species of echinoids sent to him by 

 Mr. Forrest, and these are also among the species collected by me in 

 Antigua. They are, as given by Gregory, Echinanthus concavus 

 (Cott.) and Echinanthus antillarum (Cott.). With the exceptions of 

 the two Pectens noted above, as determined by Dr. Dall, no mollusks 

 ujipear to have been recorded from this Antigua white limestone, 

 so that the few which I was able to secure will help to fix the age of 

 the formation. The limestones in some places carry many species 

 of Pectens, and as these are frequentlj' determinable even in frag- 

 ments, more attention was given to collecting them than to corals, 

 foramenifera, etc. Although difficult to extract from the rock, I 

 was fortunate (>nough to obtain five known species or varieties of 

 Oligocene Pectens as well as two new species of this genus, and a new 

 species of oyster, a TurrileUa, and six or seven species of echinoids. 

 These, with the corals that have been determined as Oligocene, will 

 serve to confirm the age of the formation. The list of species col- 

 lected from this Antigua formation is given below.

This .species was the commonest Pecten in the Antigua limestone, 



and is recorded as having been brought from Antigua l)y Spencer 



(see Dall, "Tertiary Fauna of Florida," p. 715). It was collected by 



me at Wetherill's, Hodge's Bay, and Willoughby Bay. It was 



particularly plentiful at Wetherill's Bay, but few specimens could 



be detached entire from the rock surfaces. The figure given by 



Guppy does not show the secondary radial striation, and is thus 



misleading, but the species may readily be recognized by its 10-11 



ribs, much fewer than in the other fossil Pectens of Antigua. Its 



living rejjresentatives, probably descendants in one case, are P. 



antillarum Recluz of Guadaloupe and other islands of the West 



Indies, and P. luculentus Reeve of North Australia.

specimens so named by Gabb in his Santo Domingo collection in 



The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. It was fairly 



common; did not become silicified so commonly as the la.st species,

of the two varieties mentioned bj^ Gabb.

 Spencer's Antigua specimen is not exactly like this species, his de- 

 scription agrees so well with the Willoughby Bay specimens that I do 

 not doubt this species is P. gabbi Dall. 



Fecten (Amasiam) antiguensis n. sp. Plate XVIII, figs. 1. 2, 3, S. 



This large Amu-^iuin is very common in the Antigua limestone 

 on the sea beach at Wetherill's Bay and especially at Hodge's Bay. 

 Its description will be found under "Descriptions of New Species." 

 While plentiful at Hodge's Bay, the specimens were so firmly attached 

 to the rock or iml)edded in it as to make it almost an impossibility 

 to extract entire, unbroken specimens. This species and the P. 

 anguillensis Guppy were especially likely to be found silicified. 

 This silicification has sometimes obliterated the secondary sculpture, 

 but in other cases has preserved it in most remarkably perfect con- 

 dition, as in some of these specimens. If it were not for this silici- 

 fication, it would be ver^' difficult to obtain any specimens from this 

 hard, white limestone; but this alteration, in part or wholly, to silica 

 makes the specimens weather out in almost complete and perfect 

 condition.

In some of the exposures of this limestone along the seashore,

 contained many isolated oyster shells. Of these, the specimens 

 collected at Hodge's Bay I at first referred to Ostrea gatunensis B. and 

 P., but upon further examination I find that they are the same as 

 those collected at High Point and Wetherill's Bay. These are 

 specimens of a new species to which I have given the name of Ostrea 

 antiguensis. At Willoughby Bay a much larger species of oyster 

 was observed, perhaps (). hailejinis Sowb., but specimens could not 

 l)e obtained, as they were imbedded in the hard, compact limestone.

A single young specimen of a Spondylu.s was collected at High

If incoherent or soft fossiliferous beds could be found in Antigua, 

 such as occur in Santo Domingo or on the Isthmus of Panama and 

 in Costa Rica, the fauna obtainable from this Antigua Hmestone 

 would undoubtedh' be a large one. I examined the island carefully 

 for such deposits, but none of this soft character were met with. Fur- 

 ther research maj' disclose such deposits, but unfortunately the tuffs 

 in which they might be found have undergone much compression 

 and they are too much altered, where they have, thus far, been found 

 to carry fossils, to give much hope of finding them fossiliferous and 

 at the same time soft. The limestone is sometimes in the form of a 

 soft marl, but even this has usually imdergone alteration and the 

 fossils have been subjected to crystallization which has obliterated 

 many characters. In some cases the organic remains have been 

 dissolved and replaced by silica, or the shells have been dissolved 

 away leaving a cast of the cavity, but no mould to show the exterior 

 of the organism. The most favorable place for collecting specimens 

 to represent the fauna that was seen was the region of Willoughby 

 Bay, and from what I saw there it is evident that the fauna is a very 

 large one. 



That the igneous activity continued during the Oligocene, after 

 the deposit of these limestones, is indicated bj- the occurrence at 

 Crosbies of a dyke of dark andesite which has been injected into the 

 white marl and has altered it in places, the dyke itself being also 

 altered. This dyke is 15 feet wide or more, and is compact and not 

 porous. This localitj' at Crosbies is neaf the northern shore and 

 about a mile to the southwest of Hodge's Bay. Purves mentions 

 this locality, but places it on the seashore. Angular lapilli of volcanic 

 ash were found in the limestone at Hodge's Bay, indicating volcanic 

 action at this time. 



5. Hodge's Hill Calcareous Sandstone (of Spencer). 



Professor Spencer has given this name to a calcite sandstone 

 composed of water-worn grains of coral, shell, and other calcareous 

 matter, found at Hodge's Hill in the northeastern corner of the 

 island. These beds are seen along the shore at Hodge's Bay over- 

 lying the hard Antigua limestone, and resting ujion them with a very 

 flat dij). Spencer regards this contact as unconformable, but there 

 seems to be no erosion unconformity, and the difference in dip is 

 very slight. The material ha.s a very different appearance (as 

 regards compact ne.ss, for example) from the harder Antigua limestone 

 which it overlies, but I have no doubt that it is really a part of the 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 605 



same formation. It contained the Orbitoides and many fragments of 

 echinoid.s, and furnished a recognizable Smki, referred to below. 

 Spencer" remarks of these sandstones that "one suspects the Hodge's 

 Hill sandstones belong to an epoch not long subsequent to that of 

 the former rocks" (Antigua limestones); a conclusion in which I 

 certainly concur. In fact, it seems more than probable that they 

 are onlj- the continuation upward of this same Antigua formation. 



6. Friar's Hill Gravels and Marls (of Spencer). 

 An undoubted unconformity, representing a break in the deposi- 

 tion of the formations lasting through the Miocene and Pliocene, 

 separates these gravels and marls from the Oligocene of the Antigua 

 formation. These deposits of Friar's Hill rest upon the eroded sur- 

 faces of the Antigua limestone, and consist, at the base, of water- 

 worn pebbles, derived from the underlj-ing formations; and this 

 laj'er of pebbles is overlaid by a compact, buff -colored marl stated 

 by Spencer to have a thickness of about 12 feet, and doubtless likewise 

 derived in large part from the underlying marl itself. The material 

 seems to be always not greatly different from the underlying marls 

 of the Oligocene, as though derived in each case from rock in the 

 immediate vicinity. Spencer, also, notes that the material tloes not 

 seem to have been transported to any distance. I am inclined to 

 think it should be connected with the Cassada Garden gravels as the 

 ■•ihore d(po.'<it that was formed during this depression of the island 

 when the shell beds of the Central Plain were being laid down, and 

 the Cassada Garden gravels are the current-transported materials of 

 the same general age. I have not seen these Cassada Garden gravels 

 overlying the Friar's Hill depo-sits, and at Cassada Garden the 

 gravels rest upon the tuffs under the Antigua formation. No fossils, 

 except those that are derived from the marls, are found in the Friar's 

 Hill deposits, but, up to at least 1.50 feet above sea level, the shells 

 of the next division cover the ground in the region of the Central 

 Plain. The Friar's Hill gravels, according to Spencer, occur up to 

 200 fe(!t above sea level, while I have traced the shell deposits of the 

 Central Plain (as above stated) up to at least 1.50 feet above the 

 sea level. 



7. Shell Beds of the Central Plain. 



Throughout the Central Plain of Antigua, from the neighiiorhood 

 of St. John's to Willoughby Bay, .sea shells are encountered in the soil 



"Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc. London, Vol. LVII, 1901, p. 499. 




606 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV., 



and lying about on the surface, being brought up in every excavation 

 and digging up to, in the region of St. John's, "125 feet above sea level. 

 The}' are found in some places upon hills to a level of 150 feet above 

 the sea. They are not confined to the Central Plain entirely, for 

 they were seen near St. Mary's Rectory, in the volcanic part of the 

 island, at least 100 feet above sea level. In the vicinity of Willoughby 

 Bay they were seen in the soil of the Central Plain at elevations of 

 upwards of 100 feet also, but they were not noted in the soil upon the 

 high hills near the Montpelier estate in this vicinity. The species 

 were those now living in the sea surrounding the island. Thej' occur 

 in the surface soil, but it cannot be said that there is any very recog- 

 nizable deposit which contains them. As they are in a sujierficial 

 deposit, this is not to be wondered at; the surface soil everj-where 

 has been disturbed for some depth on account of the cane cultivation, 

 which covers all the available cane-producing land in the island. 

 In some places these marine shells are found associated with recent 

 land shells, as has been ilescribed of the raised beaches or horizontal 

 marls of Purves, although these land shells are the species now living 

 in the places where these marine shells occur, and have come into the 

 .soil much more recently than the marine shells. During the time 

 of the deposition of these shell deposits the island nuist have stood 

 at a level of at least 150 feet lower than at present and, in fact, have 

 been divided into two or more islands by the sea, which occupied 

 the Central Plain. Across this plain the sea must have been driven 

 by the trade winds, this wind drift making a current (during the 

 time of greatest depression) rimning through the Central Plain from 

 Willoughln' Bay to St. John's Harbor. The excavating power of 

 this current may have had its part in the formation of these two 

 bays, and of the depressions along the coast from St. John's Harbor 

 north to Corliizon Point, such as Dickenson's Bay. The rise of tide 

 in .\ntigua is slight, but it must have produced a very appreciable 

 current in this central depression; and during the ebb and flow of 

 the tide, until a channel was established across the inland during the 

 time of sinking, currents due to this cause must have run in and 

 out of the i)ays. Even during the time of greatest submergence 

 such currents must have been formed and in their flow have had a 

 tendency to scour the bottom of the bays at either end of the central 

 depression. The currents set up by the tide or (during the time of 

 maxinnun submergence) l)y the \vind drift would be strong enough 

 to produce the water-worn character observed in the Cassada Garden 

 gravels. And the apjK'arance observed in these materials of having 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 607 



been transported a considerable distance would be explained by the 

 existence of such currents. The Cassada Garden gravels, as I saw 

 them at the type locality, occupy depressions in the general surface, 

 where they have accumulated, and thej^ also occur as low hills or 

 mounds above the general surface. They may represent local 

 channel or even shore deposits when the sea occupied this central 

 plain. More to the east, in the bays that would be formed by such a 

 depression, the Friar's Hill gravels and marls might have been locally 

 formed. The general occurrence of marine shells up to 125-150 feet 

 above sea level, wherever either in the Central Plain or in the 

 volcanic region to the southwestern part of the island the surface 

 soil was exposed by cultivation, is a character of the geology of the 

 island that at once strikes the observer. And from this higher 

 elevation down to the sea level such occurences of sea shells are com- 

 mon all over the island. In the Central Plain the form of surface 

 characterizing a raised beach has not been preserved, but nearer the 

 sea level there are definite raised beaches, some of which were ob- 

 served l\y Purves and named the "horizontal marls." They no 

 doubt had an origin similar to that of the salt pond and mangrove 

 swamp deposits that are still forming. But the marine shells of the 

 older submergence were in large part or entirely the same species as 

 those of these later deposits. And since the greatest depression of 

 the island during which these shell beds of this submergence were 

 laid down, the general movement of th? island has been upward. 

 Indeed, old maps like that accompanying Nugent's paper, compared 

 with present conditions, would indicate that this upward movement 

 is still going on. Evidence of the submergence is to be seen not only 

 in the marine shells found in the soil; the underground water from 

 the region of the Central Plain (tarries a large percentage of sodium 

 chloride. In wells in this Central Plain and in the water from 

 springs in this region the amount of .sodium chloride is so high as 

 to become characterictic of tJie water of the region. Thus at Gam- 

 ble's Spring it amounts to 1137 parts in 100,000, as determined from 

 an analysis made in 1906, and at Gunthorpe's well, according to an 

 analysis made in 1905, the .sodium chloride content rose to 1458 parts 

 per 100,000. '•' M Cassada Garden the sodium chloride content in 

 the water is much less— 390 parts per 100,000. .\way from this Central 

 I'lain depression the amount of sodium chloride is found to decrease, 

 and this is a characteristic of the limestone district; for instance, at 



" "The Water Supply of Antigua," by H. A. Tempany, West Indian Bulletin, 

 Vol. XII, No. 4. 




608 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV., 



Parham, New Work, the salt in the water was only 14.7 parts per 

 100,000 in 1911. On the other hand, in the raised beach deposits 

 in the east of the island the content of sodium chloride in the water 

 is often as much as, or more than, that of the Ca.ssada Garden well, 

 and this is doubtless true of all districts recently covered by salt 

 ponds, although they now may show no evidence of recent sub- 

 mergence. 



The marine shells found scattered through these shell beds are 

 apparently all recent species; they include many gastropods and a 

 much larger number of pelecypods. A few specimens were gathered 

 and some of the larger species simply noted. Among the gastropods 

 the large Strombus gigas L. was occasionally seen, also Melongena 

 melongena L., and Livona pica L. were often encountered. A few 

 specimens of Purpura were seen and P. deJtoiclea Lam. was collected, 

 as was also Bullaria occidentalis (A. Ad.) and Modulus modulus (L.). 

 The pelecj'pods collected include Area chemnUzii Phil., Cardium 

 muricatum L., Chione cancellata L., and two varieties of Anomalo- 

 cardia Jlexuosa L., but many other species were seen, especially 

 Codakia orbicularis (L.) and Codakia orbiculata Mont. A limpet, 

 Fissuridea barbadensis Gmel., was observed. Land shells, particularly 

 Bulimulus guadalupensis Brug., are plentiful in the soil mixed with 

 the marine shells, they have jjroliably been n-cently introduced into 

 this deposit from forms living in the Central Plain when it was first 

 cleared and settled. 



8. Raised Beaches, Horizontal ]\L\rls of Purves. 



Along a part of the north shore of the island and also along the 

 northeast shore down to Ht. George's Church there are, at certain 

 places, definite horizontal deposits, consisting of marl with marine 

 and land shells often mixed together, imliedded in the deposit. These 

 hav'e been described l)y Purves as the horizontal marls, and are well 

 developed in the vicinity of St. George's. Church. They are not seen 

 at any great elevation above the present sea level, not more than 

 10-12 feet, and are ])robably old salt jKind dei)osits. The one at 

 St. George's Church contains plentiful remains of land shells mixed 

 with marine species. Here I saw Pleurodontc formosa (Fer.) with the 

 deeper i>igment bamls still showing their color; although the finer 

 color pattern characterictic of the recent shell is lost. Drijiiurus 

 I'longalus Bolt, was also plentiful, but the specimens of P. formosa 

 (Fer.) outnumbered the Drymwus about three to one. This Antigua 

 .species of Pleurodonte was only known alive, to the local collectors 




1913] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 609 



from the volcanic part of the island, in St. Mary's, and is not now 

 living, so far as knowTi, in the north of the island. I fouiul it living 

 at Montpelier in the limestone district of the southeast extremity 

 of the island in St. Philip's Parish. I collected at St. George's 

 also the e.xtinct Helicina named by Purves, Helicina crosbyi, which 

 appears to be a good species, not hitherto described or figured, but 

 his Succineas do not differ from the living Succinea barbadensis Guild. 

 These two Succineas found in this marl Purves has named .S. boonii 

 and .S. boonii var. elongata,^'' and he states that they are not now living 

 in .\ntigua, but they seem to me to be simply variations of the living 

 .^.trictac/e/m-s Guild, which is found living everywhere in the limestone 

 district. It is to be noted that these so-called extinct forms are 

 larger than the normal living forms; and also a large ".semi-fossil" 

 Succinea has been collected in Santa Cruz which belongs to the same 

 species as these from the horizontal marls. The Helicina crosbi/i of 

 Purves is not known in the living .state in Antigua, it seems to be 

 really extinct. It is not the species found in the neighboring island 

 of Barbuda, and more clo.selj' resembles one of the Jamaica species 

 of Helicina than any known species, but, as stated, it is probabl}^ a 

 good .species. It is described with other undescribed species in this 

 paper. 



The list of species given by Purves of the land shells found in these 

 marls includes Cistuln antiguensis Shutt., now living at Wetherill's 

 and near Montpelier, that is, at the northwest and at the southeast 

 corners of the island, but not seen living elsewhere; and also Suhulina 

 octona Brug., found everywhere. The only really extinct form is the 

 Helicina cfosbyi. None of the marine species observed are extinct, and 

 all are still living about the shores of the island. Such a deposit as 

 this one at St. George's (and similar ones are known along the north- 

 east and north shore to Boone's Point) was probably formed in much 

 the same way as the present salt ponds. It was at one time u 

 shallow bay, the mouth of which was cut off by the growth of man- 

 groves, and it thus became a lagoon. Into this lagoon, the washings 

 from the hills brought down the land shells that cover the ground, 

 even at present. This part of the islantl must have been grown up 

 in "bush" similar to the vegetation that now covers Barbuda, 

 in which bush Pleurodonle formosa, Helicina crosbyi, Cislida 

 antiyuenni.s, Drymcvus elongalus, Bulimulus guadalupensis, and other 

 land shells lived; and probably also the water of the lagoon, as it

drieil up, became in places fresh, so that fresh-water forms could 

 live in it and become mixed with the already deposited marine forms 

 and the land forms. The wells near this St. George's locality show 

 much sodium chloride in the water, as though it might have passed 

 through a salt-pond stage. Such salt-pond deposits may have formed 

 during the last stages of the rising of the island from the submergence 

 at the time of the deposit of the shell layers in the Central Plain, 

 already noted. Salt ponds now occur along the west coast of the 

 island, but I did not personally observe them along the east coast; 

 these "raised beaches" are probably such deposits in the limestone 

 along the east coast. They are not likely to be of any great antiquity, 

 and are not greatly different in their origin from what is now forming 

 in the salt ponds of the western side of the island. 



9. Salt Pond and Man&rove Swamp Deposits. 



As Just noted above, these deposits are characteristic of certain 

 places on the western shore line, from Corbizon Point to the vicinity 

 of St. ^larj-'s, Old Road. They are shallow bays that are gradually 

 filling up. They are seen in all stages of development, for instance 

 in the region of the head of Five Islands Bay and between this and 

 St. John's Harbor. Salt pond deposits exist about a mile beyond 

 the Union Sugar Mill. Evidently here a .connection existed at no 

 very distant time between Five Islands Bay and St. John's Harbor, 

 and, indeed, upon Nugent's map this district is represented as a 

 swamp. This same map shows a bay open to the sea east of the 

 stretch of beach between Dn,' Hill and Corbizon Point, where a 

 salt pond now exists; and open water on the north side of St. John's 

 Harbor where a salt pond is now forming. Some ten such salt ponds 

 are shown upon this Nugent map from Ships Stern (at the entrance 

 of St. John's Harbor) to St. Mary's, Old Road. These shallow bays 

 are first cut off from the sea by the growth of mangroves and such 

 plants as can exist in presence of the salt water; a fringe of such 

 mangroves near the mouth of the bay becomes a places for deposition 

 of sand and other inorganic matter washed uj) by the waves, and a 

 sand tract forms, cutting off the mouth of the bay. This bar grad- 

 ually grows until the salt water only reaches in to the jiond in time of 

 high wind or tide. The water in the jxmd becomes brackish from the 

 surface drainage getting into it, and the salt-water forms living 

 in it, when freely open to the sea, are killed off, giving place to 

 brackish-water and finally to fresh-water forms, if the i)ond continues 

 to exist so long. VViien such a pond is near higher ground, the 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 611 



washing from the hills carries land shells into the pond, and these 

 are mingled with the salt-water and brackish-water forms. But in 

 many cases, the swamp water becomes so foul during the change 

 from salt to fresh that no brackish-water forms can live in it. Appar- 

 ently, too, the change is rapid in some cases and no brackish-water 

 forms migrate in. The shallow ponds become swamps and finally, 

 draining to the sea, dry up completely and form level stretches 

 which are occupied by the "bush," and eventuallj- by cultivations 

 of some kind. One such level stretch, formerly occupied, no doubt, 

 by one of these salt pond swamps, is now under cultivation as a 

 cocoanut plantation, near St. Mary's in the Valley. 



Along the east coast such salt ponds were not visited, and perhaps 

 they may no longer exist, but they are indicated on Nugent's map 

 as occurring at several places along the northeast coast of the island. 

 I have no doubt that the "horizontal marl" deposits in the vicinity 

 of St. George's Church have had some such history; and if the general 

 movement of the island is an upward one at present, as seems to be 

 the case, other shallow bays such as are found along this east coast 

 may develop into such salt ponds in the future. But the upward 

 movement would seem to be more characteristic of the west coast 

 than of tht> windward region, and the salt ponds of the west side of 

 the island are now forming and show all stages of development. 

 That such deposits must have occurred during the last emergence 

 of the i.sland and that traces of them are .still to be seen in the interior 

 (in the Central Plain, for instance) there can be little doubt. When 

 they are very shallow and dry up when in the salt stage, leaving 

 deposits of salt impregnating the surface soils, is probably indicated 

 in the large amount of salt found in the shallow surface wells in some 

 places at the present time. This salt impregnation of the soil in 

 certain parts of the Central Plain iuis been noted under the "shell 

 beds of the Central Plain." A local development of the same 

 character, due to the accumulation of salt in hollows, subsequent to 

 the last emergence of the island from the sea may be the cause? of 

 the "gall s])ots" noted in the cane cultivations in the Central Plain 

 and eastward. These are places where the growth of the cane is 

 poor, and they are generally marked by a yellowness of the cane 

 itself. Mr. Tempany, Superintenilent of .-Xgriculture for the Leeward 

 Islands, who has made many soil and water analyses, agrees with me 

 that the gall spots are ai)par<'ntly places where soluble salts in the 

 soil have aciniiiiulatcd to a point which interferes with tlic growth 

 ■of the plants. .

This species was named by Purves H. crosbyi, but apiuu'cntly 

 never described nor figured. It is easily identified as the sj>ecies 

 referred to by I\I. Purves, as it occurs fossil in the "horizontal marls"' 

 at several points noted i)y him, but is unknown in the living state 

 and appears to be extinct. The "semi-fossil" shells are entirely 

 without pigment, so that what colors the original shell possessed must 

 remain unknown. The form of the heavy callus and the great 

 thickening of the outer lip which characterize this species recall the 

 lip and callus of the Jamaican Helicina neritella aiiyulata C. B. Ad., 

 which, however, differs from this species in having tiic angulation

Shell elongate, slowly tapering, of many whorls, with a raised

 revolving spirals, about five between the first and second major 

 spirals, and the same number between the second and third major 

 spirals, with a like number from the third spiral to the suture. These 

 secondary spirals may become knotty and beaded when crossed by 

 the diagonal growth lines, and the doubling of the major spirals 

 comes from one of these minor spirals becoming enlarged on that side 

 of the major spiral towards the apex. The suture becomes depressed 

 by the shell being excavated above the suture or on the basal side of

 are stronglj' rugose, even in some cases spinose, but all may be 

 distinguished bj' the broad furrow which runs across the exterior of 

 the lower valve about opposite to the muscle impression and which 

 divides the rugae into a groujj of five and one of two. The species 

 differs also from all other closely related American species by the 

 upturned margin of this lower valve and the correspondingly reflexed 

 margin of the upper or flat valve.

THE LAND AND FRESH- WATER MOLLUSKS OF THE STANFORD EXPEDITION 

 TO BRAZIL. 



BY FRED BAKER, M.D. 



It was my good fortune to accompany tlie Stanford Expedition 

 to Brazil, Dr. J. C. Branner, Director, in the summer of 1911, and I 

 have been requested by Dr. Branner to report on the land and fresh- 

 water mollusks. For apparent!}' good reasons, the report on the 

 marine mollusks will occupy a later paper. 



Mollusks were taken at nearly all points visited by the members 

 of the Expedition, and a large number were sent to me after my 

 return to the United States by the Goeldi ^luseum of the city of 

 Para, through the kindness of the Acting Director, Dr. Emilia 

 Snethlage, and from the Museu Rocha in the city of Ceara, through- 

 the kindness of Mr. Francisco Dias da Rocha, who owns this museum 

 and who deserves great credit for his scientific spirit and untiring 

 work in bringing together this very valuable collection. I beg to 

 acknowledge this great courtesy, as well as the assistance rendered 

 to me personally and to the other members of the Exjiedition during 

 our stay in Para and Ceara by these well-known Brazilian naturalists. 



After about four months spent in northeastern Brazil, six members 

 of the Expedition returned to the United States, leaving ]\Ir. W. M. 

 Mann and the writer. We made the trip ui> the Amazon and Rio 

 Negro to Mamios. There we met Mr. R. H. May, of the contracting 

 firm of May, Jekyll & Randolph, who were then completing the 

 Madeira-Mamor6 R. R. around the falls of the Matleira and Mamor6 

 Rivers, to give access to the rich rubber country on the navigable 

 waters of the tributaries of the Madeira River system and to furnish 

 a fea.sible route into Bolivia from the north. On his invitation, 

 we went aboard one of their steamers down to Itacoatiara, below 

 the mouth of the Madeira River, thence uj) the Madeira to Porto 

 Velho, the .starting point of the railroad. At this point we were 

 tendered all the facilities of the road and W(> were the guests of the 

 contractors for about two months, travelling over the whole line to 

 the (iuajara-Assii Falls, the upper falls of the Mamore River, just 

 above which point navigable water is reached an<l tiie terminus of 

 the road is to be located. On this jiortioii of the triiiwc crossed 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 619 



the river into Bolivia on three occasions. I wish here to extend 

 my most sincere thanks to Messrs. May, Jekyll & Randolph for their 

 courtes}', which made the work done on this part of the trip possible, 

 and to the many employes of the INIadeira-Mamore Co. who rendered 

 us assistance and personal courtesies in very large measure during 

 this most dehghtful journey. 



By a curious difference in tlie time of tlie dry season of the different 

 districts visited, all the work of the Expedition was done during the 

 dry season in each district, except that the rainy season was just 

 beginning as we left the Madeira River and during our last short 

 stay in Pard. Everywhere we found shells aestivating, and it is 

 probable that this accounts for the somewhat limited list of species 

 actually taken by the members of the Expedition, and for the large 

 number of dead shells which made up much of the collection. 



The ground covered by the Expedition and by the locations from 

 which the mollusks here reviewed were taken can be divided easily 

 and naturally into two distinct districts, the second of which, on 

 account of the great extent of the country included and because a 

 distance of nearly five hundred miles intervenes between the two 

 nearest locations, can be again divided conveniently into two dis- 

 tricts. The first, northeastern Brazil, includes about all of the 

 States of Rio Grande do Norte and Ceard; it is scantily timbered 

 as a rule, dry, with an average rainfall of from ten to twenty inches, 

 and a climate not unlike that of Southern California, Arizona, and 

 New Mexico. The coast region is generally low, with a few low ranges 

 of mountains, the interior higher. In this district are included 

 Natal, Pirangy, Papary, Estremoz, Ceara-Mirim, Taipu, Baixa 

 Verde, Limocira, and the Mossoro region, Ceard, ]\Iaranguape Moun- 

 tain, Monguba, Buturite, Qubcada, and Camocim. 



The other main di.strict, with Maranhao on the outskirts, includes 

 all other locations mentioned in this paper, beginning with Pard 

 and ascending the Amazon and its tributaries, the Tocantins, Jary, 

 Jamauchim, Maccuru, Tapajoz, Madeira, Mamor(5, and various other 

 small streams. This district is an immense, low, alluvial plain, 

 almost universally heavily timbered, in most of which there is a long 

 rainy season, the annual rainfall averaging u]) towards a hundred 

 inches in many years, filling many streams more than bank full and 

 producing great sloughs and lakes. Naturally, the climates of the 

 two districts are radically different, although a consitlerable number 

 of species overlap. As noted above, it is convenient to divide this 

 district into two at any point between the mouth of the Tapajoz

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Dec, 



Iliver and Itacoatiara, leaving in the first subdistrict Maranhao, 

 Para, and all points on the lower Amazon and its tributaries up to, 

 and including, the Tapajoz and including in the second subdistrict 

 Itacoatiara on the Amazon and all of the Madeira River and its 

 tributaries. 



The shells here reported represent 43 genera, 93 species, and 20 

 subspecies, of which 33 species and 12 subspecies seem to be new. 



The types of all of the species and subspecies are deposited in the 

 collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and 

 cotypes of many of them will be deposited in the collection of the 

 Leland Stanford Jr. University at Palo Alto, California, and in the 

 JMuseu Goeldi at Para, Brazil. 



In the following list, the species and subspecies are considered 

 with reference to the three districts herein marked out, column 

 one representing the first district, including Rio Grande do Norte 

 and Ceara; column two representing the second district, extending 

 from jNIaranhao to the Rio Tapajoz and its tributaries, and column 

 three representing the third district, including Itacoatiara and the 

 whole of the Madeira River System.

It wall be .';een, therefore, that 49 speeies and subspecies were taken 

 in the first district, 52 in the second, and 34 in the third. The fol- 

 lowing statements show the districts in which reiiresentatives of 

 the various genera were taken. 



Twelve genera repre.sented in the first district only: Anostoma, 

 liifidaria, CcFcilioides, Eupera, Idiopyrgiis, LHtoridina, Odontostoinus, 

 Psadani, Seymentina, Succinea, Thymnophorn, Tomigerus. 



Eight genera repre.'^ented in the second district onlj" Diplodon, 

 Doryssn, (lundlachin. lloiiisinna. Marixa, Prixodon, Strobilops, 

 Zoniloides. 



Seven genera reprcsenteil in the third district only: Drymwus, 

 Enlodina, Cluppya, Orllialicus, Plckocheilun. Solaropsis, Systropliia. 



Five genera represented in all three districts: AmpuUario, 

 Bulimuliia, Opeas, Strophocheilus, Subulina. 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 623 



Three genera represented in the first and second districts: 

 Oxysfyla, Physa, Plaiwrbis. 



Six genera represented in the second and third districts: Anodon- 

 tites, Castalia, Corona, Euglandina, Happia. Leptinaria. 



Two genera represented in the first and third districts: Helicina, 

 Streptaxis. 



Thirty-seven species and sul^species were taken in the first district 

 only; thirty-six species and subspecies from the second district 

 only; twenty-two subspecies from the third district only. 



Four species were taken in all three districts. 



Six species in the first and .second districts: six species were found 

 common to the second and third districts, and two species to the 

 first and third districts. As the collections are. very incomplete, 

 it is not necessary to list the .species taken in each district here, 

 but the degree of endemicity is roughly indicated by this summary. 



A list of the locations from which the collection was taken, with 

 the latitude and longitude figured for some of the less known places 

 as accurately as it could be done from the ordinary maps, is published 

 on succeeding pages. 



In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge my great obligation to 

 Dr. Branner for inviting me to become a member of the Expedition 

 and to the other members of the party for many kindnesses; to 

 Professor F. W. Kelsey, of San Diego, C'ahfornia. who has prepared 

 all the photographs used in the reproductions for this paper; to 

 Dr. H. von Ihering, of Sao Paulo, Brazil, for furnishing valuable 

 papers on BraziHan moUusks; to Dr. Paul Bartsch of the National 

 Museum for comparing doubtful species of the Ampullariidxp with the 

 collections of that institution, and in largest measure to Dr. H. A. 

 Pilsbry, of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, for a 

 very large amount of help in the determination of species of all 

 groups and for most valuable assistance in the preparation of this 

 paper.

HiAicinn lirifera Ancey, Jour, of Conch., vii, p. 90, 1892. \\'agner, Con- 

 chylien Cabinet, Helicinidce, p. 286. 



A single, half-grown specimen was taken at Camp 40, M. & jNI. 

 R. R., and about thirty specimens, mostly dead and of various ages, 

 were taken at Camp 39. 



In his original description Ancey says, " In front scarcely noticeably, 

 or not at all descending." The largest specimens taken descend 

 positively, though not greatly, in front for about -half a turn, leaving 

 the sharp keel of the preceding whorl fully exposed. I suspect that 

 Ancey's description was based on specimens not fully matured, and 

 it seems better to add this point to the description of his species, 

 rather than create a new subspecies, inasmuch as these shells agree 

 perfectly in all other respects with his description. The mature 

 specimens have .5 whorls; no specimen with over ih wtiorls fails to 

 show the characteristic drop of the last whorl. 

 Helicina schereri n. sp. PI. XXI, figs. 1, 2. 



Shell thin, imperforate, turbinate, subglobose, with slightly convex 

 sides; color yellowish to reddish bronze; apex oljtuse, slightly 

 mammillate, smooth for about one whorl, then everywhere sculp- 

 tured with nearly even and evenly spaced, narrow, spiral keels with 

 broader interspaces, about seven or eight keels showing on each 

 whorl, the keels weakening and becoming more crowded and less 

 tlistinct on the base, but extenduig to the umbilical region an^l 

 dipping deeply into the aperture in some apparently mature .speci- 

 mens; keels everywhere crossed by sharply retractive, crowded 

 growth lines which are exaggerated into distinct costulse in places 

 on the lower whorls. Whorls 4|, somewhat convex, the last sul)- 

 angulate at the beginning, but becoming well rounded toward the 

 mouth, scarcely descending in front; sutures very di-stinct. Aper- 

 ture broadly semilunar, oblique; peristome very evenly rounded, 

 somewhat thickened and slightly expanded, but not reflected, the 

 upper extremity joining the parietal wall at an angle slightly under 

 90 degrees, the lower extremity rounding broadly into the columella; 

 columella short, nearly vertical, broadened above; i)arietal wall 

 slightly convex, with a callus varying in apparently mature specimens 

 from a small band seen only fleep within the tnouth to a broad, thin

About forty specimens of this very pretty species were taken 

 under dead leaves near the limestone quarries at Ceara-Mirun. 

 About a quarter were living and seemed to be nestivating. A single 

 specimen of the same species ''from the State of Ceara" was sent 

 by !Mr. Rocha. The species may be distinguished by its small size, 

 thin te.xture, and coarse spiral sculpture, and it is not related to any 

 described species. It is named for Dr. C. A. Scherer, of the ^Medical 

 Corps of the ^ladeira-Mamore R. R., who was our host at Camp 39 

 and who aided us greatly in our hunt for zoological material.

Shell rather thin, imperforate, subglobose, with straight sides; 

 epidermis thin, col<jr light yellow throughout, slightly shining; apex 

 rather acute, slightly mammillate; nepionic H whorls suggestive 

 of Drymceus, but with the pits placed irregularly, though somewhat 

 on spiral lines; post-nepionic whorls everj^'here marked by micro- 

 .scopically distinct, very strongly retractive growth lines which are 

 sharply decussated by equally protractive, fasciculated, incised 

 lines, which divide and anastomose irregularlj', the growth lines 

 becoming more nearly vertical as they pass the periphery and 

 approach the umbilical region, while the incised lines become more 

 nearly spiral and less distinct. Whorls 41, slightly convex; perijihery 

 of the last whorl scarcely angulate except over the fir.st quarter turn, 

 not descending in front; sutures distinct. Aperture subelliptical, 

 sui>horizontal; peristome rather evenly roundetl, thickened and 

 exjianded moderately, joining the columcllar base with a distinct 

 angulation: columella short, nearly vertical, spreading above into 

 the broad, thin callus which covers the ,slightly convex parietal wall.

One living and two dead specimens of this species were taken near

 This species has heretofore been known only from Orbigny's descrip- 

 tion. He procured his type of the var. Icevigata from the Mission of 

 San Jose, Clii(iuitos Province, Bolivia, nearly 200 miles from these 

 locations. Our specimens are a slightly smaller race (diameter 

 8, instead of 10 mm.), with the tooth of the outer lip a little less 

 prominent than would seem to be called for by Orbigny's descrip- 

 tion, but they almost surely fall into this variet}'.

 twisted so as to appear clo.sed above the last whorl, but actually 

 extending to the apex; thin, pellucid, glo.ssy, very faintly yellowish; 

 the first If nepionic whorls nearly smooth, the rest closely, irregularly, 

 and finely co.stulate, the costukie slightly arcuate and strongly retract- 

 ive, about as wide as the interspaces, in places indistinct, but 

 showing about 13 to the millimeter on the penultimate whorl; 

 costuliP obsolete on the base except at the mouth of the umbilicus 

 where tliej' are intensified rather abruptly, forming about twelve 

 vertical ribs which extern! inward over nearly the whole of the last 

 whorl. Whorls 5f , increasing regularly in witlth for 4j whorls, when

 with a wider umbilicus than in the adult and showing freiiuent 

 varices (one to three to a whorl) on the ba.se, which give the young

This was the commonest species of Streptaxis at Ceara-Mirim, 

 nearly two hundred specimens having been taken ; and four each were 

 taken at Estremoz and Baixa \'erde, mostly under dead leaves and 

 •debris, but more rarely under stones and dead wood. The species, 

 which seems to be new, is related to S. glaber Pfr., but it is larger, 

 with slightly fewer whorls, a distinctly striate spire and no parietal 

 teeth. It is named for Miss J. M. Cooke, of Point Loma, California, 

 who has added many species and varieties of shells to the known 

 fauna of Southern California and Lower California. 

 Streptaxis abunaSnsis n. sp. PI. XXII. figs. S, 9, 10. 



Shell quite heavy, rather high, the spire markedly convex and 

 rotund, umbilicus moderately open; light horn colored, with a thin, 

 fugaceous, yellowish-brown epidermis; nepionic whorl smooth, 

 ioUowed by a series of broad, low, rounded, strongly retractive, 

 slightly arcuate costulse with moderate interspaces (about nine to 

 the millimeter on the penultimate whorl), becoming obsolete over the 

 whole of the last whorl, except at the mouth of the umbilicus, where 

 they can be seen with a glass. Whorls about 6, the first three rather 

 narrow and crowded, the last two much Ijroader, the shell showing 

 the characteristic distortion of the genus; sutures distinct, but not 

 impressed. Aperture somewhat triangular, a little broader than 

 high, very distinctlj' angulated at the juncture of the lip with the 

 parietal wall ; peristome white, slightly reflected above, the reflection 

 increasing to the lower juncture with the parietal wall which it meets 

 at an angle of about 90 degrees; a slight groove liehind the basal 

 lip, running into the umbilicus. 



In five specimens there are three nearly equidistant teeth within 

 the mouth, about in the middle of the parietal wall and of the basal 

 and outer lii)s, the parietal tooth being narrow and high and directly 

 entering for about I5 millimeters. In a sixth specimen the parietal 

 tooth is wanting altogether, although the other characteristics are 

 well marked. 



Alt. 6.25, greatest diam. 8, least diam. 6.2."), width of aperture 2. .5, 

 .alt. of aperture 2.25, diam. of the umbilicus .7 mm. 



Two living and four di-ad specim(>ns were taken at Camp 33, 

 M. & M. R. R., this point being known as Abuna in Brazil. 



This species, which seems to be new, is closely related to S. cumin- 

 'giamis Pfr., from which it differs chiefly by the striation of the spire 

 4ind larger size. 



Genus HAPPIA Bourguignnt. 

 Happia snethlagei n. up. PI. XXII, figs. 3, 4. 



Shell very widely, perspectively umbilicate, thin, translucent,

light horn colored, with a thin, grayif^h-yellow epidermis: nepionic 

 H whorls smooth, and, beginning on the second whorl, everywhere 

 sculptured with fine, irregularly sized and grouped, retractive, 

 arcuate costuke, showing under a strong glass as if they were sharp 

 edged, with broad, rounded interspaces; most specimens also showing- 

 some evidence of obsolete spiral striations on the last two whorls. 

 Whorls 5, slightly convex above, well rounded below and broadening 

 decidedly toward the mouth for the last quarter turn; periphery 

 well rounded, sutures slightly impressed, the upper aspect of the 

 shell being flattened to the middle of the last turn, then slightly 

 descending. Aperture oblique, lunate, as if one fifth of a circle were 

 cut out by the convexity of the penultimate whorl; peristome sharp, 

 showing a slight reflection for about one millimeter before joining 

 the lower parietal wall; extremities of the peristome approaching, 

 joining the parietal wall nearly at right angles, the upper nearly 

 horizontally, the lower nearly in a vertical direction. Alt. 6, greatest 

 diam. 12.5, least diam. 10.5, alt. of penultimate whorl at the mouth 

 4.5, alt. of mouth 5.25, least diam. of mouth 4 mm. 



The animal is dark gray with lemon-yellow tentacles. 



About 150 specimens of this .species were taken at Camp 39, 

 M. & M. R. R., a few only living, seven at Camp 40, four living and 

 seven dead at Camp 46, one dead at Porto Velho and four living 

 specimens were sent by Mr. C. W. Eaton, of the engineering force 

 of the Madeira-Mamore R. R., without location noted; also one 

 living and fourteen dead specimens, taken at the 8erra do Erere, 

 were sent from the Goeldi Museum by the Director. Dr. Emilia 

 Snethlage, to whom the species is dedicated. 



Genus ENTODINA Anr.y. 



Entodina jekylli n. sp. PI. XXII, figs. 11. 12, 13. 



Shell widely, per.spectively umbilicatc, grayish corneous; nucleus 

 nearly smooth, and, commencing on the second whorl, everywhere 

 sculptured with prominent, narrow costiB (about eleven to the 

 millimeter at the beginning of the last whorl), seiiaratetl by broad 

 interspaces, nearly vertical on all but the last whorl, where they 

 become arcuately retractive; costte slightly less prominent below 

 the periphery, but .showing distinctly as they dip into the umbilicus, 

 as well as on the preceding whorls within the umbilicus. \\h()rU 

 4j, convex, periphery well rounded, sutures deeii. Aperture di- 

 agonal, irregular, a broad oval below, i)artially sei)arated by the 

 teeth from a small, oblique oval above; lij) shortly reflected, very

slightly thickened, the extremities joinetl Ijy a trigonal, dentifurui 

 callus and with an obtuse tooth near the upper extremity. Alt. 1..t, 

 greatest diameter 3.5, least diam. 3 mm. 



About twenty specimens of this striking species were taken just 

 below the surface of the ground, between the buttresses of an old 

 stump at Camp 39, M. & M. R. R. The species is named for Mr. 

 A. B. Jekj-11, of the firm of contractors, who made our trip to the 

 Madeira and Maraore Rivers passible and who extended to us so 

 many personal courtesies. It differs from E. reyrei Souverbie by 

 its smaller size, the absence of a swelling liehind the lip and by the 

 tooth on the outer lip. 



Genus SYSTROPHIA Pfr. 

 Systrophia eatoni n. sp. PI. XXII, figs. u. 15. 



Shell widely, perspectively umbilicate, rather thin, diaphanovis, 

 shining, grayish or grayish-yellow, the yellowish tint apparently 

 depending on an extremely thin, fugaceous epidermis; spire sub- 

 immersed, embryo nearlj' smooth, and, Ijeginning on the second 

 whorl, everywhere sculptured with irregularlj^ sized and spaced 

 costuliE, retractive on the early whorls, but arcuate on the last whorl, 

 and becoming protractive as they cross the base and dip into the 

 umbilicus; obsolete spiral markings present on the last whorl and 

 perceptible with a strong glass on the early whorls; sutures deep 

 and well defined; periphery evenly rounded except on the last 

 eighth turn, where an oblique flattening of the upper portion produces 

 a subangulation. Whorls 10, slightly convex above, more rounded 

 below, very narrow, the last more than treble the width of the 

 penultimate; not descending in front. Aperture obliquely sub- 

 triangular; lip white, thickened but not expanded, depressed above, 

 extremities distant; callus vmiting the extremities thin, but well 

 defined externally; no internal teeth. 



Alt. 5.75, great(!.st diam. 14.5, least diam. 12.5 mm. 



This species is closely related to iS. slenogyra Pfr., but it differs by 

 being smaller, with scarcely .so many whorls and a narrower aperture, 

 and by the lip being thickened but not expanded. S. helicycloides 

 Orb. is more dejjressed, with a distinct impression extending over 

 the last third of the last whorl. \ single, half grown .specimen was 

 taken at Abuna, Bolivia, six living specimens at Camp 35, M. & M. 

 R. R., and seven living specimens were sent from some point not 

 noted on the same railroad by Mr. C. W. Eaton, of the engineering 

 force, for whom I have named the species.

ZONITIDuiE. 



Genus ZONITOIDES Lehm. 

 Zoniteides parana n. sp. PI. XXI, figs. 12, 13, 14. 



Shell umbilicate (the diameter of the umbilicus being contained 

 4f times in that of the .shell), depressed, with low-conic spire, light 

 brown, rather glossy, with fine, close sculpture of almost exactly 

 vertical growth lines. Whorls 5, very sloAvly increasing, the last 

 founded at the periphery. Aperture lunate. 



Alt. 1.5, diam. 0.9 mm. 



A single specimen of this minute species was taken at Pard. The 

 genus is uncertain, but the texture of the shell is that of Zonitoides 

 rather than of Tbyxanophoni or any Patuloid genus. 



Genus GUPPYA Morch. 

 Guppya mayi n. sp. PI. XXI, 0. 7. 



Shell very narrowly perforate, conical, with a very obtuse apex 

 anil well-rounded ba.se, the last whorl distinctly, but not sharply 

 angulate, the apical angle being about 90 degrees; translucent, 

 slightly shining, with a thin, dull straw-colored, fugaceous epidermis; 

 everwhere sculptured with fine, irregularly spaced, retractive, 

 radiating costulse of varying sizes, crossed by more regular, very finelj' 

 incised lines, very closely and nearly evenly spaced. Whorls 5, 

 convex; sutures well defined, esjiecially above the last whorl. Aper- 

 ture semilunar, very oblique, slightly broadened above by the angle 

 of the last whorl: peristome sharp, very slightly reflected on the 

 basal portion and more distinctly as it approaches the umbilicus. 



Alt. 3, greatest diam. 3.65, least diam. 3.4 mm. 



Seven specimens of this species, which seems to be new, were taken 

 with the last species at Camp 39, M. & M. R. R. It is more elevated 

 than G. semi nil ni Moricand and has more whorls. It is named for

 Solaropsis rugifera Dohrn. PJ. XXII, figs, l, 2. 



Helix rugifera Dohrn, Jahrbuch. d. deutsch. Mai. Gesell., 1882, p. 100. 



Pilsbry, in Man. Conch. (2), v, p. 195, quoted Dr. Dohrn's remarks 

 and description of this species as follows: "I possess, unfortunately, 

 only a single specimen of this species, not fully adult, which I received 

 years ago with other species from eastern Peru. On account of the 

 sculpture, which differs remarkably from that of all allied forms, 

 I have decided to give it an (admittedly) incomplete description, 

 in the hope that someone maj* be able to complete it. H. selenostoma 

 Pfr., which is its nearest species in contour, is more narrowly con- 

 voluted, proportionally higher, and more narrowly umbilicated. " 



"Broadly urabilicate, deplanate, thin, obliquely rugose plicate, 

 the plicae vanishing beneath, brownish corneous, "flammulate at the 

 sutures and narrowlj- 2-banded in the middle of the whorl with 

 reddish; spire plane, apex rather smooth; suture moderately pro- 

 found; whorls nearlj^ 5, convex, the last rounded, not descending in 

 front; umbilicus equalling j the diameter, funnel-shaped; aperture 

 a little oblique, rounded lunar, peristome (unknown)." 



Using a perfectly mature specimen, I would amplify this descrip- 

 tion as follows: 



Shell broadly umljilicate, deplanate, thin; embryonic I5 whorls 

 smooth, a fine radiating sculpture beginning on the second whorl 

 and showing minute spiral lines under a strong glass, the sculpture 

 becoming distinctly rugose plicate on the third whorl and continuing 

 to the periphery of the last whorl, from which point, the rugosity 

 disappearing, the plica- continue well into the umbilicus as well 

 marked, irregularly sized and spaced costulse, everj-where crossed 

 by fine, irregularly spaced spiral lines which .show most distinctly 

 on the costula;; brownish corneous, flammulate at the sutures, and 

 narrowly, interruptedly, 2-banded with reddish, the lower band 

 placed at the periphery, the upper half way between this and the 

 tlammules, except on the last quarter turn, where the fiammules 

 extend to the .second band; spire plane; sutures moderately deep; 

 whorls 5|, convex, the last rounded, scarcelj^ descending in front; 

 timbilicus equaling about j the diameter, perspective; aperture a 

 little oblique, rounded lunar; peristome white, very slightly reflected 

 throughout, the reflection becoming more marked at the junction of 

 the basal part with the parietal wall. 



In none of the specimens, however young, does the sculpture 

 entirely disappear on the basal portion of the last whorl as noted by

 early whorls within the umbilicus.

BuUmulns (Rhinus) roohai n. sp. PI. XXIII. figs. 19, 20. 



Shell deeply and rather narrowly umbilicate, ovate conic, rather 

 solid, corneous in the young, the last whorl in the adult sometimes 

 showing a tendency to spiral banding in the darkest specimens, but 

 more frequently becoming whitish and translucent; surface shining; 

 first Ij ncpionic whorls with finely crinkled strife, then finely, closely 

 and irregularly retractively striate, the striae cut by a few distant 

 incised spiral lines, with intervening obsolete lines which disappear 

 on the base and lower part of the last whorl; spire conic, with slightly 

 convex sides; apex obtuse. Whorls 7, slightly convex, the last 

 rounded oval, not descending in front; sutures sharply defined, 

 moderately deep. Aperture subvertical, ovate, about one-half as 

 wide as high, nearly one-half the length of the shell, whitish to 

 corneous, corresponding to the color of the last whorl, very rarely 

 showing any banding inside; peristome obtuse, very slightly reflected 

 below, whitish; columellar margin dilated above and reflexed; a 

 broad, thin parietal callus uniting the extremities of the lips. 



Very young specimens show the characteristic pilation of the sub- 

 genus, but it is entirely absent in all mature specimens. 



Alt. 24, diam. 13.5, alt. of aperture 11, diam. of aperture 5.75 mm. 



This species, which seems to be new, is similar to B. (Protoglyptus) 

 durus Spix in size and general appearance, but it differs by having 

 fine, crinkled striae in the embryo, whilst durus has vertical ribs. 

 It is more solid than B. vesicalis urugitaijeiis'is Pilsbry, and it has 

 .spiral striae, a slightly expanded outer lip and a broader columella. 

 It differs from B. sarcochilus bj^ being stouter and having a larger 

 aperture. It is remarkable among the species of Rhinus by having 

 hairs only in the young, no trace of them remaining in the adult stage- 



This is one of the commonest shells at Ceanl-Mirim, generally 

 found living about an inch underground, under sticks and stones. 

 About a dozen living and dead specimens were taken at Jacoco, 

 about seven kilometers from Ceanl-Mirim, one living and several 

 dead at Baixa Verde, and a single dead, but well-preserved mature 

 specimen was sent to Dr. Branncr by Mr. G. A. Waring, of the 

 Brazilian CJeological Survey, from "the plains southeast of Limoeira, 

 State of Ceara, near the Rio Jaguaribe." The species is named for 

 Mr. Francisco Dias da Rocha, of the city of Ceani, who has done so 

 much throtigh the collections made for his Museu Rocha to extend 

 our knowledge of the State of Ceani along all natural-history lines.

 Srymseus branneri n. sp. PI. XXIII, figs. 1, 2, 3, 4. 



Shell broadly and openly rimate, ovate conic, thin, diaphanous, 

 shining, white or light brown, tj'pically marked in chestnut by a 

 narrow band beginning within the mouth just below the upper lip 

 attachment and continuing around the last whorl, below the pe- 

 riphery, to a point about three millimeters behind the flare of the lip, 

 and two interrupted bands, above and parallel to this, disappearing 

 Ijefore reaching the penultimate whorl, the tendency being in most 

 shells to a lessened development o'f the.se markings; embryonic Ij 

 whorls with typical Drj-maeus sculpture, the remaining portion of 

 the shell being everywhere sculptured with irregular, retractive 

 costulffi cut by close, finely incised, wavj^ lines, .subobsolete on the 

 earlier whorls; spire conic, with slightly convex outlines; apex 

 obtuse. Whorls b\ to 5j, slightly convex, the last well rounded, very 

 convex below, slightly ascending in front. Aperture short oval, 

 very slightly oblique, showing the external markings within; peris-

tome yellow, outside and in, edged narrowly with white, rather 

 broadly and flatly reflected, the terminations very slightly approach-

 the umbilical chuik, dilated; parietal callus very thin. 



Alt. 23.5, diam. 14.5, alt. of aperture 12.5 mm. Type. 

 " 25, " 15, " " " 12.5 mm. 



This species is related to D. strigatus Sby., but it differs by being 

 more obese, by the greater development of spiral striation, and in 

 having a yellow lip instead of violet as in D. strigatus. D. similaris 

 ]Moricand is similar in shape and color of the liji, but it differs con- 

 spicuously in color pattern. 



Two dead specimens were taken at Camp 40, I\I. & AI. R. R., and 

 several dead specimens at Camp 39, onlj' one being perfect and as 

 well preserved as a living shell. Many of these shells, as well as 

 many others taken on the right of way of the M. & M. R. R., were 

 more or less damaged by fire used in clearing. 

 Drymseus linostoma suprapunctatus n. subsp. PI. XXIII, figs. 5, 6, 7, 8. 



Shell oljlong, thin, diaphanous, glossy, shining, appearing nearly 

 smooth to the naked eye, but, under a glass, showing typical Drymwus 

 sculpture on the nepionic If whorls; afterward with irregular growth 

 linos and fine, indistinct, wavy incised spiral lines throughout; dirty 

 white, occasionally becoming roseate toward the lip, with wide, 

 well-spaced, longitudinal flames of brown or brownish-violet, inter- 

 rupted or crossed by a spiral row of dots just above the periphery 

 of the whorl. Whorls 6, slightly convex, separated by deep, smooth 

 sutures; spire conic, obtuse at the apex; last whorl subcylindrical, 

 more than two thirds the total length. Aperture large, oval, a little 

 oblique, light colored within except where the external markings 

 show through, and shading to roseate on the lip in some specimens; 

 I)cristoine rather broadly expanded but not recurved; columella 

 twisted, with an extremely narrow flange so reflected as to leave 

 little or no umijilicus; extremities aiiproachiiig sharjily: i)arietal 

 callus very thin. 



Alt. 26,5, diam. 11.5, alt. of last whorl 18.5, alt. of mouth 12.25 

 mm. Type. A specimen with I)roken spire measures alt. ?, diam. 

 12, alt. of last whorl 19.5, alt. of mouth 13 nun. 



This variety differs from the type of D. linostoinn (Orb.) by the 

 interruption of the vertical stripes and the development of a spiral 

 series of dots above, by the closure of the uml)ilicus and by the pale 

 aperture. In linostoma the umbilicus is distinct, the stripes are 

 continuous and the peristome of a tleep violet color. D. subsimilaris 




1913.] NATCRAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 639 



Pilsbry and D. hidalgoi Da Costa are closely related to suprapunc- 

 tatus in color pattern, but the former is a much more slender shell 

 and the latter is larger, umbilicate, and with a deep violet aperture. 

 A considerable number of dead and more or less charred and broken 

 specimens were taken at Camp 39, IVI. & M. R. R. 

 Drymaens sp. undet. 



A single young specimen was taken near the Guajara-Assu Falls 

 and two half-grown specimens taken at the Serra tlo Erere were sent 

 from the Goeldi Museum. All have typical apical Drymceus sculp- 

 ture and, as they do not fall into any of the species here described, 

 the}' are too young to diagnose with certaintj'.

The typical form was rather rare, but a few specimens were taken 

 with the following variety at Ceara-Mirim and one specimen was 

 taken at Papary; two specimens taken at Para were sent from the

 Oxystyla pulchella prototypus Pilsbry. 



Man. Conch. (2), XII, p. 137, pi. 28, figs. 32-37. 



A single immature specimen was taken near Baturite, on the Ceara 

 & Baturite R. R., one hundred kilometers from Ceara; half a dozen 

 dead specimens at Bai.xa Verde, and several thousand at Ceard- 

 Mirim, where they were aestivating, the mature specimens on the 

 trunks and lower branches of various trees, the immature specimens 

 packed away very closely in knot holes and crevices between the 

 branches of the same trees. As Dr. Pilsbry remarks, I.e., "This is 

 an earlier, less differentiated form of the species, of which pulchella 

 is an extreme and more local development. It is more widely 

 tlistributed than the typical form, occupying the northwestern and 

 southern peripheral portions of the range of the species." To this 

 I can now add the northeastern portion of (he range of the species. He 

 says further, "The largest specimen of prototypus before me measures 

 45j mill, long, with (iJ whorls." The largest specimen taken by the 

 Stanford E.xpedition mca.surcs ait. 55, diam. 36, longest axis of the 

 ajierture 34 mm., being excess of all measurements given by him 

 for either the type or the variety. Our specimens are all lighter in

 probably owing to the dryness of the climate of northeastern Brazil.

 R. R., and others in various states of disorganization at various 

 points along the right of way as far down as Camp 39 ; also two dead 

 specimens at Porto Velho. The specimen figured differs from those 

 in the collection of the Academj' of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by 

 the conspicuous blotches on the last Ik whorls and in showing a 

 darker, richer green color.

One living specimen taken at Camp 3.5, M, & M. R. R., is especially 

 large and fine, differing from the specimens in the collection of the 

 Academy (Man. Conch., XII, pi. 47, fig. 8) by a slightly smaller mouth 

 proportionally, a more rounded outer lip, and in being more brill- 

 iantly colored. It measures alt. 81. .5, diam. ol, alt. of mouth 40,

 under stones and debris. It was also taken li\'ing at the fossil beds 

 below Taipu. Nearly all specimens taken have four buccal teeth 

 and are nearly typical.

 Odontostomus (Cyclodontina) inflatus maranguapensis n. subsp. Pi. XXIII, fig. 18. 



Sliell umbilicate, shining, translucent, gray throughout except an 

 indistinct buff line below the lower suture and a narrow, scarcely 

 perceptible chestnut band behind the peristome, intensified at the 

 suture and in two blotches, one opposite the upper palatal tooth ami 

 one at the basal side of the umbilicus, both being perceptible within 

 the mouth; spire turreted-conic, with slightly convex sides, apex 

 obtuse; nepionic If whorls very finelj^ and nearly evenly decussated, 

 the spiral lines becoming obsolete on the second whorl and showing 

 thereafter as minute wrinkles, chiefly in the grooves of the distinct, 

 irregular, retractive costula; (about four to the millimeter on the 

 penultimate whorl) which cover all the remaining whorls, clip deeply 

 into the umbilicus and extend lightly over the parietal wall. AVhorls 

 8, separated l)y a narrow, deep, but not channelled, suture, scarcely 

 convex, the last having two pits behind the outer lip, one midway 

 and the other near the base, and a .slight depression paralleling the 

 end of the suture. Aperture nearly vertical, round oval, obstructed 

 by a low, entering ridge corresponding to the lower pit and taking 

 the place of the lower palatal tooth, and three distinct teeth: a 

 compressed parietal lamella, a large vertical columellar lamella with 

 a horizontal continuation below which includes the obli(iuc, twisted 

 umbilicus, and a motlerate-sized upper palatal lamina in the middle 

 of the outer lip; peristome light gray, broadly expanded and very 

 slightly reflected, the channels characteristic of the section being 

 rather shallow.

meters from Ceard, and two specimens "from the State of Ceard" 

 were sent by Mr. Rocha. All are identical except that the specimens 

 sent bj' Mr. Rocha are somewhat l^leached and show the brown 

 markings very indistinctly. The variety, differs from 0. inflatus 

 fasciatus P. and M., the common Odontostomus of the region, in being 

 smaller and lacking the characteristic brown markings, and from 

 0. inflatus costulatus Ancey in being smaller, with fewer teeth.

A single dead specimen was sent to Dr. Branner by ]Mr. G. A. 

 Waring, of the Brazilian Geological Survey, "from the plains south- 

 east of Limoeira, State of Ceard, near the Rio Jaguaribe." It differs 

 from the tj^ie by the much more convex lateral outlines of the spire, 

 which is therefore wider above, the contour of the shell being some- 

 what cylindric, while in scabrellus it tapers much more regularly; 

 the costulation is also decidedly finer than in scabrellus. It has only 

 four teeth, the .sutural, suprapalatal, and basal folds of scabrellus 

 being absent, but this deficiency ma.y be due to immaturity. The • 

 whorls arc 10; alt. 22.7: diameter 7.5 mm.

 Maranguape Mountain, and the fossil beds below Taipu and at 

 Quixada and two or three other points on the Ceard & Baturite

Tomigerus pilsbryi n. sp. PI. XXIII, figs. 9, 10. 



Shell compressed-ovate, greatly distorted as if by pressure on the 

 apertural side, imperforate, with a long, straightened umbilical 

 suture ending in a deep excavation behind the columellar lip; first 

 I5 whorls smooth, and, beginning on the second whorl, everjTS'here 

 .sculptured with very fine, irregular, retractive striulse, most marked 

 on the last half whorl, which shows, under a glass, a slight tendency 

 to the corrugation which is characteristic of several species of the 

 genus; spire conic, apex rather acute. ^VTiorls 4f, very .slightly 

 convex, the last greatly distorted, with an oblique groove behind 

 the outer lip and another behind the basal lip parallel to the umbilical 

 suture; sutures well defined. Aperture vertical, somewhat trian- 

 gular, with three lamellse on the parietal wall, the upper beginning 

 in a slight thickening of the upper extremity of the peristome and 

 entering sinuously and obliquely, three on the sloping columellar 

 margin and a large, obliquely entering, plate-like fold within the 

 outer lip, its upper, end bifid; peristome broadly expanded and 

 reflected, white; color slaty-white, shining, with a narrow brown line 

 marking the last two turns of the suture, a faint, narrow, brownish 

 band tlistinguishable on the last half turn of the body whorl and a 

 pale brown border along the umbilical suture, continued radially 

 upon the base some distance back of the basal lip.

A single specimen of this species was taken at Ceara-Mirim. It is 

 related to T. Icevis von Ihering in being nearh' smooth and colorless 

 and to T. rochai von Ihering in general contour, but it is larger than 

 the former and differs from the latter in its lower spire and less 

 angular aperture. The upper parietal fold is even more closely 

 united to the peristome than in T. clausus. It differs from all known 

 species by its much more compressed and distorted shape.

 striulte slightly arcuate, nearly vertical, but tending to become 

 retractive on the base; all except the embryonic whorls showing an 

 obsolete spiral striation under a glass; apex rather obtuse. Whorls 

 5, convex, the last on its posterior aspect exactly equalling half the 

 total length. Aperture irregularly oval; peristome unexpanded, 

 simple, curving broadly below the columellar extremity; columella 

 short, not reaching to the base, nearly straight and vertical, obliquely 

 truncate, the anterior portion twisted sharply inward, thus leaving 

 no trace of an umbilicus or umbilical fold.

 third whorl and widely separated on the last .(about six to the 

 millimeter on the penultimate whorl). Whorls 5|, moderately con- 

 vex; sutures well impressed. Aperture irregularly triangular; 

 peristome thickened and slightly reflected, extremities not approach- 

 ing and joined by a heavy callus, which is sharply defined externally 

 and dips deeply into the mouth, over which are laid two revolving 

 lamella which reach the exterior edge of the callus, one very large 

 just exterior to the middle of the parietal wall and a second of less 

 than half the size half way between this and the columella; columella 

 marked near the top by a third quite prominent revolving lamella, 

 leaving a very narrow slit between it and the parietal wall; base 

 showing externally two revolving lines, probably representing internal 

 basal revolving laminae.

Eight living specimens, all apparently mature, were taken under 

 the bark of a decaying tree in the dense forest surrounding water 

 works of the city of Pard. 



The species is the first representative of this genus to be taken 

 south of the Amazon River, so far as is known to the writer.

 Two dead specimens, one taken at Baixa Verde, a second from 

 Ceard sent by Mr. Rocha, agree in the main with this species as 

 described by Pfeiffer with some doubt as from Ceara. They are 

 somewhat larger and do not show the obsolete decussation mentioned 

 bj' him, but this may be due to their being worn.

No specimen of this family was taken by the members of the 

 Stanford Expedition, the following species being represented by 

 specimens sent from the Goeldi Museum. 



Genus DOEYSSA H. and A. Adams. 



A rather extensive series of shells of this genus from the lower 

 Amazon and its tributaries seemed to unite the species inconspicua 

 Brot, transversa Lea, and nmcapa Moricand in so puzzling a manner 

 that the writer referred the whole group to Dr. Pilsbry for critical 

 examination. Dr. Pilsbrj' kindly assorted the shells and wrote the 

 following notes and descriptions of new species and varieties, and he 

 has allowed their publication in this paper. 



"The Doryssas of the lower Amazon Valley are all, so far as authen- 

 tically localized specimens are available, specificallj- distinct from 

 those of Pernambuco and southward, and also from those of Guiana, 

 though obviously related to the latter, as would be expected from the 

 intercommunication of inland waters. Aside from certain species 

 described from 'South America,' 'Brazil,' or 'Amazon,' and as yet with- 

 out known local habitation, the following have been reported from the 

 lower Amazon ^'alley■. 



"D. aquatilis (Reeve), Mclania branca Reeve, and M. charpentieri 

 Reeve, Rio Branco. 



"D. macapa (IMoricand), Macapd,. 



"D. transversa (Lea). CJuiana, Cuming coll., i)ro])al)ly incorrect;

"D. bullata (Lea), Melania ventricosa Moricand, M. batesii 

 Reeve. Macapd. 



"D. lumbricus (Reeve). Pard. 



" D. inconspiata Brot. Brazil. 



"An upper Amazon form, D. consolidata (Brug.), has been reported 

 from the Rio Branco, whether correctly or not is uncertain. Up to 

 this time, no species of Doryssa has been reported from the southern 

 affluents of the Amazon. 



" D. transversa, macapa, aquatilis, and inconspicua are modifications 

 of a single type of shell, and, until far more material is at hand, it 

 will not i)e possible to say whether they are to be regarded as so 

 many distinct species or as local races of one wide-spread species. 

 Each river .seems to have its slightly individualized race or races, 

 but the localities are still so scattered tiiat we liave no adequate 

 knowledge of how much iutcrgradation exists.

"The shell is spirally grooved, five grooves on each whorl of the 

 spire, becoming weaker on the last whorl in most specimens. Minute 

 spiral lineolation is clearly developed. A.xial sculpture of slightly 

 arcuate or nearly straight folds, which rarely persist as far as the 

 last whorl, usually being present on the spire or upper whorls only. 

 The whorls are nearly flat. Color Dresden-bro^vn, Isabella color, 

 or honey-yellow, with small, irregularly .scattered black spots, or 

 with numerous spots, more or less arranged in axial rows or confluent

 of a dull citrine or olive-citrine shade. Microscopic lineolation weak

 the derivative smooth forms being different in the two rivers. 



"Three similar shells were received from the Rio Jamauchim, an 

 affluent of the Tapajoz on the right side. Tlie smooth phase is here 

 light citrine with greenish-black lines in the grooves, and the sculp-

"Similar to D. rex regina, but having coarser spirals, a larger 

 aperture and more deviating last whorl. These two are more nearly 

 related to D. macapa Moric. than to transversa by the greater number 

 of spirals. With present knowledge, they seem specifically distinct 

 from both. The young stage resembles D. transversa jaryensis.

 penultimate whorl; microscopic lineolation obsolete on the later 

 whorls. Axial folds strong, slightly protractive, extending upon 

 the last whorl, about 12 on the penultimate whorl. Upper whorls 

 nearly flat, penultimate whorl more convex. Suture deepening on 

 the last whorl, which in its last half forms a narrow horizontal

 straight and forming an apical angle of about fifty degrees, covered 

 with a dense epidermis shading from yellow-olive on the base to 

 dark brown above, having well-developed spiral keels and vertical 

 ribs, the former better developed than the latter which become' 

 obsolete on the base, their intersection being markedly tuberculate, 

 the tubercles elongate on spiral lines; lines of growth strong, with 

 fine spiral stria;, showing in places under a glass, in the interspaces 

 of the spiral keels; first two whorls with four spiral keels, the last 

 two with five, the added k(>el beginning in the suture and becoming

the lowest on the last two whorls; base with nine keels, nearly 

 equally spaced and nearly equal, except the first, which shows a slight 

 tendency to tuberculation; interspaces rather broader than the 

 keels; last two whorls with twenty vertical ribs, the preceding with 

 eighteen; apex eroded, with about four whorls remaining; upper 

 whorls moderately convex, the last, with the base, well rounded; 

 sutures well marked. Aperture slightly oblique, broadly ovate, 

 whitish, shading to yellowish on the columella, smooth, except on 

 the parietal wall, over most of which the epidermis and basal keels 

 extend for more than a whole turn within the shell, leaving a narrow 

 space above occupied by a callus carrying a shallow posterior canal; 

 outer and lower lips, though somewhat broken, seeming to be mod- 

 erately sharp and crenulated by the external sculpture; columella 

 very concave, scarcely revolute, somewhat flattened externally, the 

 surface thus formed extending to the effuse lower lip.

Doryssa starksi n. sp. PI. XXV, figs. 5, 6, 13, 14. 



Shell varying from broadly ovate conic to rather narrowly conic, 

 very solid and heavy and with a very dense epidermis; color varying 

 from dark olive-bro-ivn to nearly black ; sculpture varying, some 

 specimens showing both strong, nearly vertical to slightly retractive 

 ribs and spiral keels throughout the whole shell, others having weak 

 vertical ribs only on the last whorl and spiral keels which become 

 nearly obsolete on the upper whorls; the most globose specimen 

 (type) with the vertical ribs more marked than the spiral keels. 

 Apex eroded in all specimens, the remaining whorls of the type 3j, 

 scarcely convex; last whorl with eleven very strong vertical ribs, 

 the penultimate with fifteen, the ne.xt with sixteen, the ribs weakening 

 towards the apex; spiral keels five, with a si.vth forming in some 

 specimens in the lower sutures or by intercalation; well-marked 

 growth lines and very distinct incised spiral striic over the whole 

 shell, the latter visible under a strong gla.ss; intersections of the 

 ribs and keels producing tubercles which are slightly produced spi- 

 rally; tubercles of the third, fourth, and sometimes the fifth keels of 

 the last whorl generally much enlarginl, ])roducing a subangulation 

 at the periphery'; ba.se moderately roundeil, -showing faint continua- 

 tions of the vertical ribs and marked by seven or eight sui)equal 

 keels with broader interspaces, the interspaces narrowing slightly

towards the bottom, the keels showing some tendency to irregidar 

 tuberculation. Aperture very oblique, oblong ovate, subangulate 

 above and below, whitish within, tending to yellowish on the colu- 

 mella; parietal wall with a rather strong callus above in which lies a 

 well-marked posterior canal, below covered by an extension of the 

 epidermis and spiral sculpture which reaches well within the mouth; 

 outer lip crenulated by the external sculpture, rounded rather 

 evenly into and through the lower lip, which is effuse in a nearly 

 horizontal plane, the so-called "auger-shaped lip" of Lea; columella 

 slightly concave, scarcely revolute, nearly vertical, and joining the 

 shovel-shaped base nearly at a right angle.

 alt. 49.5, diam. 25 mm. 



Nine specimens come from the Rio Iriri, an affluent of the Rio 

 Xingu on the left side. The species, which seems to be new, is 

 somewhat related to D. pernambucensis Rve., which is a much more 

 slender shell. It is named for Professor E. C. Starks, of Stanford 

 University, a member of the Expedition. 

 Doryssa heathi n. sp. PI. XXV, figs, 3, 4, 7. 



Shell turreted, solid, tapering somewhat irregularly to the beginning 

 of the last whorl, at which point a definite spiral constriction begins 

 which extends to the aperture; spire varying greatly in different 

 specimens, only one of which (type) is mature, some tapering regu- 

 larly, others almost pupteform ; epidermis very dense, shining ; 

 color varying from dark olive-brown to almost black; initial whorls 

 lost in all specimens, remaining whorls, except the last, nearly smooth, 

 but showing growth lines and, under a glass, minute spiral stripe 

 everywhere, anil a tendency to the formation of low, rounded sjiiral 

 keels, two at the top and one at the bottom of each whorl; sutures 

 well impressed, producing slight shouldering in some specimens; 

 sculpture changing abruptly at the beginning of the last whorl, at 

 which point a distinct, slightly tuberculate vertical rii) appears, 

 followed by fourteen others which are more marked and crossed by 

 five well-defined spiral keels, the periphery of the whorl being dis- 

 tinctly biangulate by the development of two rows of strong tubercles 

 on the third and fourth keels, the first and second keels becoming 

 moderately tuberculate on the last quarter turn, the last keel being 

 .slightly tuberculate throughout; base well rounded, circled by four 

 nearly equal and (-(jually spaced keels, which roughen as they advance, 




654 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEXIY OF [DeC, 



showing a tendency to become tuberculate. Apex eroded in all 

 specimens, about 4 whorls of the type remaining intact, the varia- 

 bility of the immature specimens making it impossible to estimate 

 how many are lacking. Aperture oblique, of an evenly distorted 

 pear shape, light colored within except where the epidermis extends 

 over the lower portion of the parietal wall for about half a turn, 

 separating the dirty white callus on the upper portion, with its indis- 

 tinct posterior canal, from the yellowish nacre of the concave, slightly 

 revolute columella: outer lip sharp, crenulated by the external 

 sculpture; basal lip effuse at a point rather distant from the base 

 of the columella. 



Alt. 44.5, diam. 17, length of aperture 13 mm. 



Eleven specimens were taken, presumably with the last species, 

 in the Rio Iriri. 



This species is related to D. rixosa Ihering by the smooth initial 

 whorls, tending to show spiral sculpture, but it differs in the develop- 

 ment of strong, tuberculate, vertical ribs on the last whorl and in 

 the oblique, concave, revolute columella. It is named for Dr. 

 Harold Heath, of Stanford University, a member of the Expedition. 



There is a curious relationship shown by the members of the group 

 including D. rixosa and the last three species, passing from the 

 elongate D. rixosa with only spiral sculpture, showing mostly on the 

 last whorl, through the elongate D. heathi with a similar spire, but 

 having on the last whorl strong vertical ribs and spiral keels with a 

 subaiigulation by the two rows of tubercles, and through the stouter 

 D. starksi with a very similar sculpturing of the last whorl, but with 

 the earlier whorls ranging from rather smooth to heavily sculptured 

 and tuberculate, to the globose D. (jlolwsa with its almost regular 

 costate and tuberculate sculpture throughout. In all, imless it be 

 D. 7-ixosa. which I have had no opportunity of examining, the keels 

 are in series of fives, and in the last two there is a marked tendencj'' 

 to the elongation of the tubercles along spiral lines. All are very 

 distinct species, but it is not improbable that two or more of them 

 may ultimately have to be unitetl with varietal rank when the field 

 shall have Ijccu fully explored and full suites of all the species .secured.

Siiell turreted conic, solid, tajJt'ring regularly; epidermis rather 

 heavy, sliglitlj' shining, light chestnut to very tlark brown, the 

 lighter specimens marked i)y small, irregular, anil irregularly placed 

 black spots; initial whorls lost in all specimens, remaining whorls

exaggerated growth lines below, and very indistinct, rather distant, 

 spiral incised lines which become fairly well marked on the base and 

 part of the last whorl, producing low, flattened costse; sutures 

 slightly impressed. Apex eroded in all specimens: greatest number 

 of whorls persisting 05. Aperture oblique, p^'riform, bluish-white 

 within, the external black spots showing through when they are 

 present; outer and lower lips thin and sharp, lower lip much produced 

 and curving sharply and smoothly into the base of the columella; 

 more mature specimens with a dense, but limited callus on the 

 parietal wall above the strongly concave and slightly revolute 

 columella. 



The type with 4j whorls measures, alt. 35, diam. 13, length of 

 aperture 15.5 mm. 



The longest specimen with 05 whorls measures alt. 38.5, diam. 

 13.25 mm. 



This species, which seems to be new, is related to D. heathi from 

 which it differs by its smaller size and lighter weight, more regular 

 form and more slender shape, and bj^ the absence of the microscopic 

 spiral lines which are very characteristic of the latter species. There 

 is a tendency to a somewhat similar change of sculpture on the final 

 whorl. ]\Iore mature specimens ma}' show the present species to be 

 only a variety of D. heathi. 



Five specimens, varying somewhat in shajie, but of nearly the same 

 apparent age, come from the Rio Jary at St. Antonio da Cachoeira. 

 The species is named for Dr. Hermann von Ihering, of the Museu 

 Paulista at Sao Paulo, Brazil. 

 Doryssa oachocirae n. sp. PI. XXV, 6g. 9. 



Shell very regularly turreted conic, of medium weight, with a dense 

 epidermis varying from light yellow-olive in young shells to appar- 

 ently nearly black in those more mature; everpvhere marked with 

 small, irregularly placed and shaped .spots, which occasionally 

 coalesce to form longitudinal stripes, these .spots well defined in young 

 shells, but only perceptible by transmitted light in the older and 

 darker ones; all specimens everywhere marked with fine, close 

 incised spiral stride, barely perceptible with the naked eye, and 

 overlying about nine low, broad, flattened, nearly ecjual spiral cords 

 which cover the whole base of the more mature .specimens; apical 

 angle about 35 degrees; nepionic whorls eroded in all specimens, 

 but probably not more than three, slightly roughened, but without 

 defined sculpture, and, beginning rather abruptly on the postnepionic 

 whorls, the rather regular growth lines are soon decussated bj' the

more distinct spiral striie over the whole shell ; peripherj' of the last 

 whorl sharply angulate. Remaining whorls of the largest specimen 

 (tjTJe) 41, with probably two or three postnepionic whorls wanting, 

 nearly flat; sutures lightly impressed. Aperture oblique, elongate 

 l^j'riform; outer lip thin, simple, joining the parietal wall at an acute 

 angle, straight for over half its length, then curving sharply into the 

 produced basal lip; columella concave, smooth, scarcely revolute, 

 subangulate at its junction with the basal lip; parietal wall with a 

 thin, bro\vn callus overlying, but not completely obscuring the epi- 

 dermis and basal sculpture where it extends well within the aperture. 



Alt. 19.5, diam. 8.5, length of aperture 7.75 mm. 



This species is distinguished from D. hohenackeri Phil, of Surinam, 

 by its smaller size, conic form, and absence of axial folds. 



Three specunens come from the Rio Jary and sixteen specimens 

 from near St. Antonio da CachcBira, "in a side arm of the Rio Jary 

 full of rapids." 

 Doryssa cachoeirse sulcata n. subsp. PI. XXV, fig. 10. 



Three specimens taken in the Rio Jary with three of the type 

 specimens differ from the tyjje by being less .sharply angulate at the 

 periphery of the last whorl and by being sculptured throughout the 

 whole shell with a continuation of the low spiral cords found only 

 on the base of the type. The whorls of the subspecies are also less 

 positively flattened than those of the t\T)e. 

 Doryssa tucunareSnsis n. sp. PI. XXV, figs. 11, 12. 



.^liell of moderate weight, ovate conic, with nearly straight sides, 

 covered by a thin epidermis; color yellowish-brown to che-^tnut and 

 marked by small, sparsely scattered black spots which are generally 

 irregularly placed, but may form axial rows; everywhere marked by 

 low-rounded, distinct, but not prominent, nearly equal spiral cords, 

 five to a whorl, with six or seven on the base, the intervening spaces 

 rather sharply incised and narrower than the cords; about twenty 

 vertical to slightly protractive and arcuate axial ribs present on the 

 early whorls, never very ])rominent, and becoming obsolete on the 

 last whorl and base; growth lines very prominent over the whole 

 shell. Apex eroded, remaining whorls 4, very slightly convex and 

 indistinctly shouldered above; sutures scarcely impressed. Aperture 

 markedly oblique, broad ovate, whitish within except where the 

 external macuke show througli; outer and lower lips sharp and 

 slightly crenulated by the external sculpture, ioase effu.se; columella 

 very convex, rounding into the parietal wall which is covered In- a 

 well-marked callus with a distinct posterior canal.

Two specimens of this species w^ere taken at Tucunare on the Rio 

 Jamauchim. The sculpture is of the type of the D. transversa group, 

 being somewhat similar to that of D. inconspicua, but the shell is^ 

 very much more obese than any member of that group.

 showing distinctly, and everywhere marked by rather shallow, 

 distant spiral sulci, obsolete above in some specimens, and becoming'

 whitish thickening within; outer lip joining the parietal wall at an 

 angle of about ninety degrees; inner margin continuous, in contact 

 with the preceding whorl; a delicate, deeply sinused callus joining 

 the extremities and extending well within the aperture. Alt. 3.17, 

 <liam. 2, alt. of mouth 1.15 mm. 



Two .specimens differing slightly in size were taken on the north 

 Ijank of the chief affluent of Papary Lake near its mouth. 



The species resembles L. charruana Orb., but differs by the presence 

 of spiral striations and by the distribution of callus within the mouth. 

 I have named the species for Mr. W. M. Mann, the entomologist 

 of the Expedition, who alone, of the members of the Expedition, 

 accompanied me on. that portion of the trip extending up the Amazon 

 and to the Madeira and Mamore Rivers, and who aided me greatly 

 in the collection of niollusks. 



Genus IDIOPYRGUS Piisbry. 

 Idiopyrgus pilsbryi n. sp. PI. XXVI, figs. V.i. 11. 



Shell perforate, turreted, solid, opacjue, olive-green, becoming 

 lighter on the last whorl; spire tajx-ring regularly to the apex, which 

 is eroded in both specimens; surface smooth except for faint growth 

 lines, rather dull. Whorls 41, all strongly convex, separated by deep 

 sutures. Apertuic ()\al,' oblique, the basal margin only slightly 

 advanced, the outer lip retracting ujnvard; iieristome continuous, 

 (juter lip slightly expanded, somewiiat thickened within, with a 

 rounded sinus just below the upper insertion anil a small sinus at 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 659 



the juncture of the outer and basal margins; colunieHa and parietal 

 margins continuous, forming a raised ledge across the parietal wall. 



Alt., estimated in full, 4.1. diam. 2.15, length of aperture 1.15 mm. 



Two specimens were taken with the last near the head of Papary 

 Lake. 



This species differs from /. souleyetanus Pils. by its darker color, 

 fewer whorls and slightly smaller size. It is the second species of 

 the genus to be taken, the other, /. souleyetanus Pils., having been 

 taken at Rio Doce, state of Espiritu Santo, in southern Brazil. 

 In his description Dr. Pilsbry remarks, "It is probably a straggler 

 from the fauna of eastern Brazil, of which little is known," a shrewd 

 deduction which the discovery of 7. pilsbryi confirms. The species 

 is named for Dr. H. A. Pilsbrj', who characterized the genus. 



AMPULLARIID^. 



Genus AMPULLARIA Lamarck. 



Ampullaria gigas Spis. 



Testae, fluv. bra.s., p. 1, tab. 1, 2. 

 Ten specimens were taken at Itacoatiara and one large antl four 

 half-grown specimens were sent from the Goeldi IMuseuin, the first 

 taken on the Island of Mexiana, two at Baiao on the right bank of 

 the Rio Tocantins, and two at Arumanduba, Parana de Ahneirim. 

 Ampullaria figulina Spix. 



L.C., p. 4, tab. iv, fig. 4. 

 Dead shells of this sjiecies were taken quite commonly on the 

 shores of Lake Estremoz and three specimens taken in the Igarape 

 de Paituna, near Monte Alegre, Fazenda Ponto, and eight taken 

 "in the wet plains near Arumanduba," Parana ile Ahneirim, were 

 sent from the Goeldi Museum. 

 Ampullaria insularum Orbigny. 



Voyage dans rAmC'r. Merid., p. 371, pi. .51, figs. 1, 2. 

 This shell was rather common in the streams about Papary, asso- 

 ciated with the commoner A. testudinea Rve., and the Goeldi Museum 

 sent seven specimens taken in the Rio Nhanumda at Fazenda Paraiso, 

 near Faro, six from Boim e Pinhel, on the right bank of the Rio 

 Tapajoz, three from Monte Alegre, Igarape Pucu, and five from 

 .Arumanduba, Parana de Ahneirim. Von Ihering {Anal. Mus. Nac. 

 Bs. As., \T, Aug. 3, 1898) considers this species synonymous with 

 A. gigas Spix. All shells examined, while showing the same general 

 form and deep sutures, were easily .separated by the much lighter 

 weight of the -shells and the more open umbilicus.

About fifty specimens were taken in an artificial lake in the park 

 in front of the Cathedral of Para, half a dozen in Papary Lake, and a 

 single dead specimen taken at Ceara-^Iirim seems to be the same.

 Planorbis straminens Dunker. 



Conchylien Cabinet, p. 4, pi. v, fig. ~a. 

 Specimens were taken with the preceding at Papary Lake, at

It differs from S. janeirensis Clessin by the unusually deep descent 

 of the last whorl at the aperture. 



Genus GUNDLACHIA Pfei£fer. 

 Gnndlachia bakeri Pilsbry, n. sp. 



Several specimens of this species were taken with Phijsa rivalis and 

 Planorbis anatinus in the artificial lake in Pard. They were not 

 noticed at the time of collection, but were discovered in a bottle 

 of alcoholics containing the Physa rivalis and Planorbis anatimis^^ 

 noted above. They are described by Dr. Pilsbry in a supplementary 

 paper.

About twenty specimens of this species were taken from the roots 



•of the water h.yacinth on the left bank of the main affluent of Lake 



Papary. In view of the diffieultj^ of the group, several closely 



similar forms being described, some of them imperfectly, it has been 



"thought best to leave this species nameless. The description and 



figure should enable some future reviser to determine the Lake

Simpson {I.e., p. 869) unites the variety with the type. About a 

 dozen specimens were taken at Camp 43, M. & M. R. R., all of which 

 were almost exactly alike, and all of which correspond so exactly 

 with Sowcrby's figure that it seems to the writer that the variety 

 must be valid.

Appendix: Notes on Gindlachia Pfr,, by H. A. Pilsbry. 



The peculiar Aneyloids known as Oundlachia have been the occa- 

 sion of some speculation and -difference of ojiinion among concholo- 

 gists. That Oundlachia is dimorphic, sometimes maturing as an 

 Ancylus without the intervention of a septate stage, was first 

 intimated by Guppy in 1870 ' and later by several other naturalists. 

 It was observed by the present writer about 188G,- and recently by 

 Mr. J. A. Allen, who proved the identity of the septate and non- 

 septate forms by breeding them in jars.

1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 669 



Nordenskiold ' and DalH consider Gundlachia to be merely a dry 

 season or winter stage of Ancylus. As Dr. Dall expresses it, "an 

 Ancylus which has under favorable circumstances been able to form 

 a calcareous epiphragm and survive the winter, which ordinarily 

 kills the great mass of individuals, and while retaining the shell of 

 the first year, to secrete an enlarged and somewhat discrepant shell 

 during its second summer," this ability not being possessed by all 

 Ancyli. 



The rarity and sporadic occurrence of Gundlachia are apparently 

 favorable to this view; yet on closer inspection, less favorable than 

 at first appears. Of the Gundlachias I have myself collected, or 

 known from specimens taken in regions where the Ancylus fauna is 

 well known, not one can be regarded as a form of any known A7icylus 

 of the region. Each one of the known United States forms of 

 Gundlachia is specifically distinct from any Ancylus, wholly apart 

 from the septum-forming ability. The case would be quite different 

 if the only difference between a Gundlachia and some Ancylus of the 

 same fauna was the presence of a septum in some individuals. 



Ancylus commonly lives over winter in this latitude. I have 

 repeatedly collected specimens in the spring, in which the previous 

 season's growth was distinguishable from the new growth by greater 

 solidity and a coat of iron stain. In the Delaware River I have 

 taken specimens in winter from under stones at low water, in places 

 which had previously been covered with ice. In size they varied 

 from quite small to full grown. 



The only case known to me where a Gundlachia has been identified 

 with a known species of Ancylus is Nordenskiold's reference of a 

 form from the Chaco region to A. moricandi Orb. It is ciuite possible 

 that this identification might be altered on thorough comparison 

 of authentic specimens. 



Dr. Dall has proposed a convenient terminology for the post- 

 embryonic stages in the life of Gundlachia, as follows: 

 I. Ancyloid stage, shell simple, .4ncii/Zus-shaped. 

 II. Septate stage, a deck or septum added. 



III. Gundlachia stage,^ an Ancylus-like shell added U) the margins 

 of the aperture of the septate stage, the latter lying obliquely upon it. 



The form in which there is no septate stage, and whicii is indis-

'The genus Gundlachia was originally described from sporiniens in the 

 "septate stage," but later was found in the third stage.

tinguishablc froiu Ancylus, may be termed the tion-septate form. 

 It is not merely the ancyloid stage grown large, because the young 

 non-septate never has the shape of the ancyloid stage. When of 

 the same length as that, it is a wider shell. This is certainly the 

 case in the Illinois species which I collected about 1886, and, so far 

 as I can make out, in Mr. Allen's Ohio specimens also. It appears, 

 therefore, that in all post-embryonic stages the septate form differs 

 from the non-septate. 



It seems certain that the typical forms of Ancijlus and the great 

 majority of knowai species never develop a septate form, which, 

 from Mr. Allen's observations, seems dependent upon physical 

 conditions. Whether Giindlachia is to be retained as a genus depends 

 upon whether we consider the ability to produce the septate form. 

 to be a character of taxonomic value. To me it appears to be so, 

 even though the character is not expressed in all individuals or 

 under all conditions. 

 Gundlachia bakeri n. sp. PI. XXVI, figs. 1, 2. 3. 



In the second or septate stage the shell is oblong, the width con- 

 tained twice in the length; sides slightlj' convex. The obtuse, 

 rounded simimit is very close to the posterior end and overhangs 

 the right margin. Back and left slope are strongly convex; posterior 

 and right slope* short and steep. There are a few low, wave-like 

 concentric wrinkles near the embryonic shell and some faint radial 

 lines on the anterior part. The sides curve into the deck, except 

 posteriorly where there is an angle or keel at junction of upper 

 surface and deck. The deck or septum is convex and covers about 

 two-thirds of the lower face. The aperture is oval, its margins 

 elevated, blackish, and a little reflexed. 

 Length 2.8, wiilth 1.4, alt. 1 mm. 



Several dozen specimens were taken during the dry season in an 

 artificial lake or pond in one of the small parks of the city of Par;! 

 situated between the public market and the Cathedral. Over a 

 hundred specimens of Fliysa riralis M. & H., J'l(uwrl)is analinus Orb., 

 and what the collector supposed to be Ancylus were taken from the 

 dead leaves and debris in the i)ond and iireserved together in alcohol. 

 Part of the collecting was done by stripping the leaves. On examina- 

 tion of the bottle after arrival in Piuladeljihia a numi)er of specimens 

 of the septate form of (lundlac.hin were discovered and the supposed 

 Ancylux is probably the non-septate form, presumably of the same 

 species. 



The jMind is two lumdred or more feet loug, rather narrow and 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 671 



winding, and averages three or four feet deep. It empties by an 

 overflow and is supplied by a small fountain which was always 

 playing on the numerous occasions when the park was visited. 

 The large amount of dead leaves and debris on the bottom of the 

 pond makes it probable that it has not been drained for a long time, 

 if ever, since its construction. 



This species, named for Dr. Fred Baker, who collected the series, 

 differs from the form figured by Nordenskiold by its smaller size 

 and the far more eccentric apex. The position of the apex will also 

 serve to separate G. bakeri from G. textilina Guppy of Trinidad 

 and all other known species of the genus. A large series taken is 

 very constant in size and form. Specimens in the first or Ancyloid 

 stage and others with the septum in various degrees of development 

 occurred in the same gathering. There were none, however, in the 

 third or complete Gundlachia stage. 



With the Gundlachia just described there were many specimens of 

 an Ancyloid which may be the dimorphic form alluded to above, in 

 which the septate stage is omitted, or possibly it may be a distinct 

 s])pcies of true Ancylus." The.se shells (PI. XXVI, figs. 4 to 8) are thin, 

 fragile, corneous, and diaphanous, oval, the apex slightly behind the 

 posterior fourth of the length and almost overhanging the right 

 margin; anterior and left slopes convex, posterior and right slopes 

 more or less concave; apex rounded, with a slight apical depression, 

 the embryonic shell minutely pitted; surface elsewhere marked 

 with faint growth lines and minute, unequal radial striae, wanting 

 on the .short slope below the apex. 



Length 4.1, width 3, height 1 mm. 



With some resemblance to A. excentricu-s Morelet, this form differs 

 by its broader contour and more eccentric apex. 



The young shell, 2.4 nmi. long (PI. XXVI, fig. 4), is much ivider than 

 the ancyloid stage of G. bakeri of similar length, the breadth con- 

 tained only about 1.4 times in the length, while an Ancyloid of the 

 same length is twice as long as broad. 



Whether this form will turn out to be the non-septate form of 

 (1. bakeri or a distinct species of Ancylns is an open riucstion, but 

 I incline to the former view.

 Others have an acute, hooked apex, al,so slightly punctate near the margin of

CUEIMATUS SPILURUS COPE, A WBONGLY IDENTIFIED CHARACIN. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



In 1878 Prof. Cope li.?ts the specimens described below as Curimatus 

 spilurus Gunther without comment. In 1906 I followed this identi- 

 fication, though recently have been able to examine Giinther's 

 species, and find it 'distinct. Cope's species therefore requires a 

 new name, and is evidently the type of a new subgenus as well.

This species is related to Curimatus dorsalis Eigenmann and 

 Eigenmann.- In C. dorsalis the preventral region is described 

 with a median series of large scales, though in the present species 

 they are uniform in .size. C. dorsalis has persistent scales, with the 

 broadly rounded posterior margin crenate, and in C. stigmaturus 

 the scales have the rounded posterior margin entire. C. dorsalis 

 has the pores of the anterior .scales of the lateral line imperfectly 

 developed or wanting, while in C. stigmaturus they are about equally 

 developed. C. dorsalis has origin of dorsal midway between tip of 

 snout and tip of adipose fin, while it is more anterior in C. stigmaturus. 

 The other characters given for C. dorsalis are largelj' in agreement, 

 though do not appear to me to be construed as due to age.

NOTES ON SOME COSTA KICAN ARACHNIDA 

 BY NATHAN BANKS. 



In the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia for 1909, pp. 194-234, I published a list of Arachnida 

 from Costa Rica kindly sent me for determination by Prof. Tristan 

 and Dr. Biolley. Since then Prof. Tristan has sent a further con- 

 sigmnent of these animals, and Prof. Calvert has sent me the Arach- 

 nids collected during his trip in that country (May, 1909, to May, 1910) . 

 The following notes are based on these collections. The types froiu 

 the material sent by Prof. Calvert are in the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia, the others are in the author's collection.

THE ANATOMY OF TWO BRAZILIAN LAND SHELLS, ANOSTOMA 

 DEPKESSUM AND TOMIGERDS CLAUSUS. 



BY HAROLD HEATH. 



Among the many strange species of Brazilian land shells, those 

 belonging to the genus Anostorna and Tomiyerus present the most 

 unusual characters. In the first named the last whorl of the shell 

 is "straightened, turning toward the margin and upward" (Pilsbry'), 

 so that the visceral mass is carried upside down. Pilsbry has sug- 

 gested that, judging by the gro\vth lines, the shell is carried at first 

 with the equatorial plane nearly vertical, and that as the last whorl 

 is being added the animal falls to the right, thus undergoing a twdst- 

 ing process which brings the spire of the shell into a reversed position. 

 Unfortunately, no young, living individuals were secured by the 

 Stanford Expedition, but in the shell (PI. XXXI, figs. 2,4) of one imma- 

 ture specimen the free borders are highly angular, and if held in an 

 upright position, as Pilsbry suggests, would offer the least possible 

 resistance in moving about through the grassy regions where these 

 snails abound. 



The specimens of Anostomn on which this paper is based were found 

 in the low hilly country in the neighliorhood of Baixa \'erile, a small 

 settlement between 40 and 50 kilometers to the northwest of Natal. 

 A fire had swept the region in comparatively recent times, and 

 fragments of shells were everywhere abundant in the scrubby under- 

 brush of the rocky hills. Extended search brought to light a single 

 living individual in a profound state of aestivation, which a prolonged 

 stay in a moist chamber failed to terminate. In addition, five dead 

 shells were discovered in a heap of .stones, and were measured and 

 described in the field. According to my notes made at the time, 

 they vary in greatest diameter from 33 to 37 mm.; in lesser diameter 

 from 24..') to 28.5 mm.; and in altitude from IG to 17.5 mm. Also 

 in regard to the number and position of the ai>ertural teeth or lamellaj 

 there is considerable variation. In two specimens there are seven, 

 two of them being parietal; in another there are likewise two parietal 

 folds, but the columcllar lamella is absent; in the remaining two 

 there arc three parietal folds, the middle one curving behind the 



' Manual of C'onchology, Vol. XIV. 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 6S& 



angle lamella as in A. ododentatum, while of the lip teeth the colu- 

 mellar fold is lacking entirely in one specimen, and is almost com- 

 pletely obsolete in the other. Where the color persisted, the 

 peristome was pinkish-brown or flesh tinted and characteristic of the 

 species. The immature shell measures 21 by 18 mm. in width, 

 with an altitude of 10. -5 mm.: the axis is hollow and the mouth 

 possesses no lamellae. 



After the living spechnen had been decalcified and sketched (PI. 

 XXXI, fig. 3), it was .stained and sectioned, all the study of the various 

 systems being made from reconstructions. The head region was 

 highly contracted, and was not examined to any considerable extent. 

 The unusual length of the mantle cavity, extending from the peri- 

 cardium to the external pore, is reflected in the great length of the 

 mantle arteries and veins, as well as that of the ureter and portions 

 of the reproductive system. Otherwise there are no especially 

 noteworthy features beyond what are indicated in the figure?. 



The kidney, placed between the pericardial and body walls on the 

 anterior face of the last fold, presents the usual sac-like appearance. 

 Evidentlj^ the reno-pericardial opening is minute, if it exi.sts at all, 

 for a careful study of sections failed to disclose its whereabouts. 

 The ureter, likewise, is difficult to trace throughout a portion of its 

 course. Its external opening is immediately behind that of the 

 alimentary canal, and from this point is readily followed to' the 

 region of the pericardium, where it decreases in caliber and passes 

 into a network of blood vessels. Furthermore, the present specimen 

 was slightly damaged in the region of the columellar muscle, thus 

 adding to the difficulty of tracing the connections. It appears that 

 the kidney is in contact, along its inner face, with a slender sack or 

 tube with which the ureter communicates. 



The digestive system (PI. XXXI, fig. 6) requires no especial descrip- 

 tion. A highly intelligent native lad of Baixa Verde is responsible 

 for the statement that Anostoma lives solely on vegetable matter; 

 at all events, several specimens, that he kept for several months, 

 thrived on garden vegetables and moss. He had made no observa- 

 tions on the position of the body in young individuals. 



The description of the reproductive system of A. ringens, as 

 described by Fischer,'- applies in all essential details to .1. clepressum, 

 with the exception of a penis retractor muscle attached to the vas 

 deferens. In A. depressum the external reproductive pore, located 



s Jour, de Conchyl., 1869, p. 261. 




690 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



on the right side of the head, leads into a small atrium with which 

 the penis, hermaphroditic duct, and seminal receptacle attach. 

 The first named is a heavy, muscular organ, accompanied by the 

 usual slender vas deferens, their union being effected at some distance 

 from the distal end of the penis, which thus forms a flagellum (PI. 

 XXXI, fig. 7, f). As the flagellum thus holds identically the same 

 position as the so-called penis retractor in .-1. ringens, I am strongly 

 inclined to the opinion that we are actually dealing with flagella in 

 both instances. In the present specimen the penis and flagellum 

 are both sharply defined and appear to be without muscular attach- 

 ments, though bound to the body wall by delicate connective tissue 

 strands. In the neighborhood of the outer opening, however, the 

 penis sheath affords attachment for three or four slender muscle 

 bands that I am inclined to regard as penis retractors. 



The hermaphroditic duct, a highly glandular duct of comparatively 

 even diameter, traverses the greater portion of the first coil of the 

 body to enter the accessory glands. All of these structures are in a 

 quiescent condition, and in size and configuration probably fall far 

 short of their fully developed state in the sexually mature condition. 

 The same is likewise true of the gonad. WTiile the duct leading to 

 it from the accessory glands is clearly apparent throughout the first 

 part of its course, it gradually approaches the vanishing point, and 

 cannot with certainty be traced to a gonad, which is accordingly 

 drawn in its hypothetical position. 



Two living specimens of Tomigerus clau^us were found beneath 

 stones in the vicinity of Ceara-Mirim, a town about midway between 

 Baixa Verde and Natal. Both were in a state of wstivation, and 

 failed to revive, though kept in a moist chamber for several days. 

 It is evident from several features of the shell and internal organiza- 

 tion that the shell in this genus is carried with its principal axis 

 transverse to the longitudinal axis of the foot; that is, the spire is 

 directed to the right. The flattened surface of the outer whorl thus 

 rests upon the dorsal surface of the foot or upon the substratum 

 when the animal is in a state of sestivation, a position which they iiad 

 assumed in l)oth instances. 



.\s each individual was in a highly contracted state, with foot and 

 head drawn far within the shell, external features are difficult to 

 <leterininc. It appears certain, however, that the mantle, with 

 more highly thickened margins and more glandular epithelium than 

 in Anostoma, extends tiiroughout the first whorl of the shell to the 

 region adjacent lo the aperture. It thus terminates at the point 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 691 



where the ureter fPl. XXXI, fig. 5, u) bends abruptly upon itself. The 

 external openings of the ureter and intestine occupy the usual 

 positions on the right side, and from this point pursue a course 

 parallel to the external surface of the body in close contact with the 

 mantle cavity. As noted previously, the ureter bends sharply upon 

 itself at the termination of the mantle cavity, and, dorsaUy placed 

 with reference to this chamber, proceeds anteriorly to unite with the 

 forwarcl extremity of the kidney. This last-named body is a com- 

 pact, sac-like body consisting, as usual, of highly folded glandular 

 epithelium confined, in the posterior half of the organ, to the outer 

 face. As may be seen in the diagram (PI. XXXI fig. 5), the peri- 

 cardium (p) is in contact with this glandular section throughout its 

 entire length, but is scarcely more than half as extensive. The 

 reno-pericardial opening was not observed. It may be added that 

 the kidney is placed dorsalh' with reference to the pericardium. 



The reproductive system, considering that the gonad is in a 

 highly quiescent state, is comparatively large and more compact 

 than in Aiiosioina. The gonad consists of several slender diverticula 

 (proliably three times as many as are indicated in PI. XXXI, fig. 1), 

 located in the apical whorls of the visceral mass. These contain 

 primitive sex cells undifferentiated into sperms and ova. The 

 hermajjhroditic duct extends ventrally, close to the columella, and 

 shortly before entering the accessory glands attaches to a slender 

 pear-shaped organ, possibly a seminal vesicle, consisting of upwards 

 of ten small diverticula imbedded in a muscular sheath. These are 

 empty and give no sign of glandular activity. The accessory glands 

 are voluminous, though inactive organs, who.se general extent is 

 indicated in PL XXXI, fig. I, ag, though several lobes give them a 

 much greater dorso-ventral thickness than can be shown in the 

 figure. The duct leading from the accessory glands becomes con- 

 .sideral)ly widened near its proximal extremity, and possibly functions 

 as a shell gland. As in Ano.sto^na, the duct from the seminal recep- 

 tacle springs from this point, and, as a slender canal, proceeds to the 

 spacious sack situated in close proximity to the accessory glands. 

 The vas deferens, likewise, unites with the penis some distance from 

 its distal extremity, thus forming a flagellum (PI. XXXI, fig. 1). No 

 penis retractor has been discovered in this region. On the other 

 hand, several strands attaching to the penis sheath in the neighbor- 

 hood of the outer opening may operate as retractors. 



The digestive system is sufficiently illu.strated (PI. XXXI, fig. 5) 

 to reciuirc no further explanation beyond the statement that three 

 distinct t)ilc ducts open into the stomach.

 issue of the publications, are matters of congratulation. The 

 difficulty of securing desirable attendance at the meetings, noticed 

 in my last report, continues, the committee appointed to look after 

 the interests involved having been active only during the latter part 

 of the year. Better results may be secured for the coming sessions. 



Ten meetings were addressed by F. D. Weidman, Edw. H. 

 Thompson, John M. Macfarlane, Philip P. Calvert, H. Newell 

 Wardle, William E. Hughes, Henry Skinner, T. Chalkley Palmer, 

 Charles S. Boyer, Hugo Bilgram, and W. H. van Sickle. 



Forty-four papers have been presented for publication as follows: 



Henry W. Fowler, 7; Joseph C. Thompson, 4; A. P. Brown and 

 H. A. Pilsbry, 2; Amos P. Brown, 2; James A. G. Rehn, 2; J. A. G. 

 Rehn and Morgan Hebard, 2: Nathan Banks, 2; Morgan Hebard, 1 

 Will F. Thompson, 1; R. A. Speath, 1; Francis W. Pennell, 1 

 T. D. A. Cockercll, 1; E. G. Vanatta, 1; S. Stillman Berry, 1 

 Frederick D. Weidman, 1 ; Edgar T. Wherry, 1 ; Witmer Stone, 1 

 Clarence B. Moore, 1; Dr. A. Hrdlicka, 1; Herbert Campion, 1 

 Philip P. Calvert, 1; Henry A. Pilsbry, 1; R. W. Shufeldt, 1 ; Thomas 

 Barbour, 1: William H. Dali, 1; Frederick Baker, 1; Annette 

 Frances Braun, 1; N. E. Mclndoo, 1; Harold Heath, 1, and Henry 

 Fox, 1. 



Thirty-three of these have been printed, two have been returned 

 to the authors, and nihe remain in the editor's hands awaiting publi- 

 cation. 



The papers by Mr. Clarence B. Moore and Dr. Hrdlicka con- 

 stitute the first part of the sixteenth volume of the Journal. It 

 forms, as usual, a beautiful contribution to anthropological science. 

 The expense of publication has been borne by Mr. Moore. 



The contribution from Miss Annette F. Braun begins the second 

 part of the sixteenth volume of the Journal. It will lie illustrated 

 by text figures and i)y two fine plates printed in color and furnished 

 by the author. 




694 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



The parts of the Proceedings pubhshetl have amounted to 

 670 pages and 25 plates. ]\Ir. iMoore's contribution to the Journal 

 embraces 102 pages and two plates beautifully printed in color, 

 besides a number of fine halftone illustrations. Of the Transac- 

 tions OF THE American Entomological Society (Entomological 

 Section of the Academy), 248 page.s and 26 plates have been pub- 

 lished, and of the Entomological News 432 pages and 14 plates 

 have appeared. Two numbers of the ^Ianual of Coxchology, 

 consisting of 112 pages and 27 plates, make the total output for the 

 year 1,564 pages and 94 plates. 



A careful revision of the exchange list has been made l)y Mr. Fox. 

 Letters have been sent to a number of derelict societies asking for a 

 supply of deficiencies and announcing a suspension of correspondence 

 until their indebtedness be cancelled. This action has been produc- 

 tive of some good results. 



Eight members and one correspondent have been elected. The 

 deaths of sixteen members and six correspondents have been an- 

 nounced. Resignations of membership have been accepted from 

 Joshua L. Bailey. William S. Newcomet, and S. Harbert Hamilton. 



The Curator of the William S. Vaux Collections, the Custodian of 

 the Isaac Lea Collections, and the Solicitor of the Acailemy in position 

 last year were reappointed by the Council. 



The interest so loyally manifested during his life by the Rev. 

 Leander T. Chamberlain in the condition and growth of the collection 

 of Eocene fossils a.ssociated with the memory of his father-in-law, 

 Isaac Lea, was further shown by a bequest of .S5,000 for the care and 

 increa.se of the collection. Dr. Chamberlain ilied May 16, 1913. 



A bequest of .?10,0()0 has been receiveil from Miss .\ima Blunohard. 

 who (lied Augu.st 2, 1913. 



The Acailemy formally thanked Dr. Thomas Riddle for the 

 valuable adtlitions he has made to the mammalian collections, 

 especially for the skeletons aaid mounted specimens of anthropoids. 



I regret to report that a bill which had passed the Senate and 

 House of Representatives, appropriating §90.000 to the Academy, 

 failed to receive the signature of the Ciovernor and was therefore 

 inoperative. 



Sanniel (!. (iordon ha.s been aiijiointed a Jessuji Fund student, 

 Miss Harriet Newell Wardle was rea))poinfed (in the ffmaie branch 

 of the endowment. 



In the Monday evening course of lectures, extending from .January 

 6 to May 5, three lectures on problems of bird life were tlelivered

by Dr. Witmer Stone; one on milk-horn epidemics of communicable 

 diseases by Dr. B. F. Royer; one on a sanitary survey of the Alle- 

 gheny water shed by ]\Ir. T. Herbert Snow; three on anthropology 

 and ethnologj' by Dr. Spencer Trotter; three on entomology by 

 Dr. Henrj- Skinner: three on studies in local plant life by Mr. 

 Stewardson Browni, and three on the natural history of the Hawaiian 

 Islands by Dr. Henry A. Pilsbrj'. 



The afternoon course for students of the Girls' High School began 

 October 8, and was largely attended. Two lectures each were 

 delivered by the following: Dr. Henry Skinner on insects; Dr. 

 Henry A. Pilsbry on crustaceans and mollusks; Dr. J. Percy Moore 

 on reptiles and mammals: Dr. Witmer Stone on birds, and I\Ir. 

 Stewartlson Brown on plants. 



There has been a gratifying increase in attendance on all the 

 courses.

REPORT OF THE Cl'RATORS. 



During the pa.st year the work of the museum .staff has been 

 mainly devoted to completing and improving the arrangement of 




700 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



the study collections, which, as stated in last year's report, had 

 nearly all been moved into new or renovated quarters, upon the 

 completion of the building operations in 1912. 



A large amount of work along these lines was necessary, and the 

 appended reports of the special departments will show in detail the 

 results that have been attained. 



In the departments of Entomology, Ornithology, and Botany, 

 which underwent the greatest changes, immense improvements have 

 been made in the arrangement of the collections, rendering them 

 much more accessible and providing for the accommodation of 

 additional accessions. 



Furthermore, these arrangements and the acquirement of addi- 

 tional storage cases will permit of the withdrawing of duplicate 

 material now on exhibition, especially in the departments of Con- 

 chology and Ornithology, and facilitate the display of the remainder 

 to much better advantage. In this connection the preparation of 

 descriptive labels is contemplated, while groups illustrative of the 

 life history of the species will be substituted for single mounts. 



Comparatively little change has been possible in the arrangement 

 of exhibits this year owing to the crowded condition of many of the 

 cases and the lack of new cases for the north wing. The former 

 condition will be remedied during the coming year, as already 

 explained, while it is hoped that enough new cases may be obtained 

 to permit of the reopening of the north wing. 



The greater part of the collection of vertebrate fossils has been 

 thoroughly cleansed, removed from the old table cases, and arranged 

 systematically in trays which have been temporarily placed under 

 the mahogany cases containing the exhibition series of fo.ssil mol- 

 lusca. Here they are readily accessible for study until permanent 

 cases can be provided. 



The removal of the \Vm. S. Vaux collection of minerals to the 

 old library hall has been completed and Mr. F.J. Keeley has rearranged 

 the specimens; while under his direction Mr. S. G. Gordon, a student 

 on the Jessup Fund, ha.s continued the cataloguing of the collection 

 which was begun some years ago. The skeleton of the large Sperm 

 Whale, secured in 1911, has been placed temporarily in the centre of 

 this hall, where it has attracted nmch attention. This .skeleton 

 together with one of the Me.soplodon makes the Academy's .series of 

 the larger Cetaceans almost complete as far as genera are concerned. 



Mr. Clarence B. Moore has continued his investigations of the 

 Indian mounds of the southern United States and has added a 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 701 



number of valuable specimens to his collection. The general archaeo- 

 logical collection has benefited as heretofore from the attention of 

 Miss H. N. Warden. 



Mr. Henry W. Fowler has, as usual, cared for the ichthyological 

 collection and has also incorporated all of the additions to the col- 

 lection of reptiles and amphibians and examined and rearranged 

 the entire series of alcoholic crustaceans. 



Dr. J. P. Moore has cared for the collections of worms as in previous 

 years. 



Work in other departments is described in the appended special 

 reports. 



In addition to the work of the musemn staff, the Curators are 

 indebted to Mr. F. J. Keeley for the care of the Wm. S. Vaux col- 

 lection of minerals; to Mr. IVIorgan Hebard for furnishing an assistant 

 in the entomological department to mount specimens of Orthoptera; 

 to Dr. Amos P. Brown for the identification of many speciiiiens of 

 invertebrate fossils, and to Messrs. S. S. VanPelt and Bayard Long 

 for the care of the local herbarium. 



Several notable expeditions have been undertaken hy memliers 

 of the museum staff. 



Dr. H. A. Pilsbry spent the first three months of the year in the 

 Hawaiian Islands making studies and collections for a monograph 

 of Hawaiian tree snails. Details of his work will be found in the 

 special report appended hereto. 



Mr. J. A. G. Rehn spent the month of .July with Mr. Morgan 

 Hebard investigating the Orthoptera of the Southern States from 

 Virginia to Georgia. They made a valuable joint collection. 



Mr. Stewardson Brown again visited Bermuda in company with 

 Dr. N. L. Britton, in September, and continued the investigation of 

 the flora of the island. 



Many short trips were also undertaken which have added largely 

 to the local collections of fishes, reptiles, insects, mollusks, plants, etc. 



Fifty-two storage cases and two-hundred and two insect boxes 

 have been purchased during the year. 



Many valual)l(> additions have been received by gift, inirchase, and 

 exchange, as set forth in the accompanying list of accessions. 



The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club, Philadel])hia Botanical 

 C'lub, and Pennsylvania Audvihon Society have held their meetings 

 regularly at the .\cademy during the year and the American Asso- 

 ciation of Museums convened here for their annual meeting in April. 



The attendance in the museum is constantly increasing, especiallj' 




702 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



school classes accompanied by teachers. Out-of-town schools have 

 visited the museum in a body, while Philadelphia schools, notably 

 the High School for Girls, have sent the scholars in sections for the 

 study of special departments in regular sequence. 



The classes from the School of Industrial Art have also attended 

 regularly for the purpose of sketching the osteological and other 

 exhibits. 



Extensive use has been made of the study collections in all depart- 

 ments by visiting specialists, while specimens have been loaned to 

 Robert Ridgway, W. W. Cooke, W. G. Mazyck, M. L. Fernakl, 

 H. W. Henshaw, J. H. Ashworth. R. H. Howe, 6. P. Hay, R. South- 

 ern. E. W. Nelson, E. S. Shumann, F. ^NI. Chapman, M. J. Rathbun, 

 and H. C. Oberholser. 



A series of mounted mammals of Pennsylvania was contrib- 

 uted to the exhibition of the State Forestry Association. 



Samuel G. Dixon, 



Executive Curator. 



Report of the Department of Molluscs. 



Accessions to the collection of mollusks have been received from 

 66 persons and institutions during the year. 



^'aluable material has been collected by several expeditious made 

 by members or friends of the Academy. Mr. J. H. Ferriss spent 

 four months in Arizona, exploring the Santa Catalina and White 

 Mountains, finding an abimdant fauna of land mollusks at elevations 

 up to 13,000 feet. As the localities had not been visited before by a 

 collector of shells and the species are largely local, he secured a large 

 numlier of species new to science and valuable zoogeograj^hic data. 

 The collections made have been generously shared with the Academy. 



Doctor Amos P. Brown gave the Academy a collection of the 

 mollusca of the island of Antigua, B. W. I., taken by him iluring the 

 summer. It is probably nearly or quite complete for land forms and 

 inckKles also a considerable number of marine shells. 



The Special Curator spent a few days over three months in visiting 

 the Hawaiian Islands, chiefly for the purpose of studying land snails 

 of the family Achalinellidce, both in the fieitl ami in Hawaiian col- 

 lections. Over 1,000 lots of shells in trays anil bottles have been 

 lai)elled and catalogued, and about an equal number remain to be 

 worked over. Special attention was given to the deposits of fossil 

 lanil shells, and about 20,000 specimens of fossils were collected. 




1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 703 



So far as studied, these collections show that the fossil faunas of the 

 several islands are much more closelj' related to one another than are 

 the living faunas. The theorj- that the islands are portions of a 

 former large land-area, now dismembered by subsidence, is therefore, 

 emphatically supported by the new data obtained. Collections 

 were made on Oahu, Molokai, Hawaii, and the uninhabited island 

 Kahoolawe. The success of the expedition was largely due to the 

 generous hospitality of the Bishop Pauahi Museum, Doctor C. 

 Montague Cooke, Mr. George Cooke, Mr. Irwin Spalding, Mr. D. 

 Thaanum, and others, who in manj- ways assisted the investigation. 



The time of the Special Curator since his return has been largely 

 occupied with work on material brought back and with the current 

 work of the department. Papers have been published on Lower 

 Californian Helices and various other topics and "Sir. Vanatta pub- 

 lished upon new marine mollusks. 



With the assistance of Dr. A. P. Brown, who devoted considerable 

 time to the work, progress has been made in the arrangement of the 

 invertebrate fossils. Dr. Brown has presented to the Academy a 

 collection of Oligocene fossils which he made in Antigua and de- 

 scribed in the Proceedings of the Academj-. 



Miss Winchester, artist of the department, has continued her 

 work throughout the year. Mr. Vanatta was assigned to work in 

 the Entomological Department on April 1st, but since December 1st 

 has returned to the Department of Mollusca. The Curator has 

 also had the assistance of Miss Ziegler, who has spent five months 

 in assorting minute shells from the Hawaiian Islands. 



H. A. PiLSBRY, 



Special Curator. 



Report of Curator of William S. ^'Aux Collections. 



During the past year, the collection of minerals was removed to 

 its new quarters in what was formerly the Library Hall, and during 

 the past few months, with the assistance of Mr. S. G. Gordon, rapid 

 progress has been matle on the cataloguing and numbering of the 

 mineral specimens. 



Twenty-two specimens have been added to the collection during 

 the year, in the selection of which, the established precedent of 

 securing quality rather than quantity has been adhered to. The 

 most important accessions include a suite of aerolites from Hol- 

 brook, Ariz.; tantalum, Altai Mountains; andoritc, Oruro; enargite,

1913.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 705 



In the Coleoptera the exotic species from Cicindelidie to Scara- 

 beidsE have been transferred to the Ridings cabinets. All the named 

 exotic species that were not incorporated have been added to the 

 exotic collection. The Zimmerman collection, the Poey, Cuban 

 collection and the Salle collection of Mexican species have all been 

 labelled. 



In the North American series the rearrangement of the Carabidse 

 and the Gyrinidse have been completed and the Hydrophilidse in 

 part. 



The Horn types in Carabidse and Elateridie have been labelled; 

 also the Curculionidse and some of the smaller families. 



The following families have also been rearranged: Rhinomaceridae, 

 Rhynchitidae, Attelabidae, Brysopidae, Otiorhynchidse, Curculionidse, 

 Brenthidse, Calandridse, Scolytida?, Anthribidse, Haliplidse, and 

 Dytiscidse. 



More than a hundred species undetermined in the Horn collection 

 have been named by specialists and incorporated. 



In the order Hymenoptera the family Chalcididse has been re- 

 arranged. 



In the Diptera the Sapromyziihc and Agromyzida? have been 

 determined and rearranged, and the Stratiomyidse, Culicidae, and 

 Syriphidse have been put in better order. 



The Odonata have all been transferred to glass-toppetl drawers 

 with the exception of some specimens on which studies are being 

 made. 



The work on the order Orthoptera has been as follows: 



The North American and exotic collections of Dermaptera and 

 Blattida; have been rearrangetl in the large glass-top boxes in which 

 the whole collection of these orders will eventuallj' be displayed. 



Some thousands of specimens from numerous exotic localities have 

 been relaxed and mounted and in part permanentlj' labelled, pre- 

 paratory to study. The series of the genera Dickopetala, Insara, 

 and Arethcea have been critically studied by Messrs. Rehii ami 

 Hebard, the latter spending a numl^er of months monographically 

 studying the North and Central American crickets of the genus 

 Nemobius. To complete the.se studies, all the types in America 

 and certain of those in Euroj)ean collections were examined by 

 one or other of the authors. A faunistic paper on the C)rtlK)i)tera 

 of the Florida Keys and extreme Florida was prepareil by the; 

 «ame workers, based wholly on material collected by the Hebard- 

 Acadcmy Expedition of 1912. Mr. Reim has studied two extensive 




706 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



collections of Argentine Orthoptera, the first set of each becoming 

 the property of the Academy, while work by him on a large series of 

 Brazilian material is now under way. 



During the summer of 1912 Messrs. Rehn and Hebard .spent four 

 weeks in the field in the Piedmont regions of the Southeastern States 

 collecting Orthoptera, while in October and November Mr. Hebard 

 made collections in Jamaica and Panama which will, when studied, 

 add greatly to the value of the series of Orthoptera. 



Mr. Hebard during the last year deposited the last section of his 

 collection in the Academy. Numerous specimens have been received 

 from him as distributions of the Bruner Collection material, these 

 often of great value on account of their determination by their 

 former owner. 



Mr. Hebard has continued to employ help in preparing the series 

 of Dermaptera and Orthoptera secured by field work in which he is 

 interested, thus affording material a.ssistance to the department. 



The Academy has acquired by purchase a valuable series of 

 Orthoptera from Trinidad, British Guiana, Peru, Ecuador, and 

 Colombia. The Orthoptera collections of German Central African 

 Expedition of 1910-1911, have been received for study, as well as a 

 number of other series from different sources. 



There is now assembled in one room in the Academy the largest 

 series of Orthoptera and Dermaptera in America and one of the largest 

 in the world, the number of specimens exceeding one hundred and 

 fifty thousand, almost entirely an accumulation of the last fifteen years. 



The Conservator spent several weeks during the smnmer col- 

 lecting in the White ^Mountains of New Hampshire and succeeded 

 in securing a number of rare species for the collection. 



The usual meetings of the Section have been held, with an average 

 attendance of eight persons. Four Associates have been elected. 



At the annual meeting, held December 8, the following persons 

 were elected to serve as officers for the ensuing year. 



Director. Philip Laurent. 



Vice-Director. Henry W. Wenzel.

Report of the Botanical Section. 



During the year, following the policj- of replacement of the old 

 wooden cases by metal ones, further changes have been made in the 

 arrangement of the herbarium. 



The Academy has furnished the herbarium during the year twenty 

 additional tins, part of which have been installed in the place of 

 the wooden cases formerly occupying the east wall of the north 

 room, the balance having been used to relieve the crowding in the 

 central room. The wooden cases thus removed have been placed 

 on the east wall of the local room, relieving temporarily the over- 

 crowding of this rapidly growing section. The cases taken from the 

 local room have been re-erected in the central gallery room and are 

 being used at present for storage. 



More than 10,000 specimens have been added to the general 

 herbarium during the year, the largest accessions being the herbarium 

 of Dr. C. D. Fretz, of Sellersville, Pa., presented to the Academy. 

 It numbers approximately .5,000 sheets, about one-third of which 

 have been assigned to the local herbarium. A large exchange of 

 several thousand plants has been secured from the Trenton Museum, 

 and smaller collections from the New York Botanical Garden, Gray 

 Herbarium, and University of Pennsylvania, with donations from 

 Charles S. Williamson and others. A majority of these plants have 

 been mounted and installed in the collections. 



During September the Conservator spent three weeks in Bermuda, 

 continuing his studies there in company with Dr. and Mrs. N. L. 

 Britton, of the New York Botanical Garden. On this occasion 

 particular attention was paid to the plants in several of the old gar- 

 dens in the vicinity of Hamilton and St. George's, much assistance 

 being rendered by Mr. E. J. Wortley, of the Agricultural Gardens. 

 Many specimens of interesting tropical plants were collected. They 

 will add greatly to the value of our study material. 



During the year the Philadelphia Botanical Club has held its 

 meetings regularly in the herbarium rooms, and its members as well 

 as many visiting botanists have made much use of the collections. 



Mr. S. S. Van Pelt has continued his valued services in the care of 

 the local collection, and the Section is indebted to Mr. Bayard Long 

 for important assistance in the same field. 



At the annual meeting held November 20, the following officers 

 were elected.

MiNERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The Section has held four meetings this year, with an average 

 attendance of twelve. 



Communications were made by Dr. E. T. Wherry, on crystal 

 analysis; by Dr. Thomas C. Brown, on the geology of the Catskill 

 Aqueduct; by Dr. T. C. Brown, on a canoe trip in Northern Quebec; 

 and by Dr. Florence Bascom, on an excursion of the International 

 Geological Congress north of Lake Ontario. There were also 

 shorter communications and various discussions. 



In addition, the Section had one meeting in conjunction with the 

 Academy, and Dr. E. T. Wherry then reported on the International 

 Geological Congress held at Toronto last August. 



The Section had six field excur.sion^, with an average attendance of 

 17. Visits were made to: (1) Crystalline rocks near Glen Mills 

 and Lenni, on Chester Creek and at Black Horse, Delaware County; 

 (2) Crystalline rocks and their minerals near the Falls of French 

 Creek, Chester County; (3) Cry.stalline rocks near Holme-burg and

Report of the Ornithological Section. 



More progress has been made in the arrangement of the study 

 series of birds during the year just closed than has been possible for 

 many years past. 



Mr. D. E. Culver, who has occupied a Jessup studentship during 

 the year, has devoted nearly all of his time to the relaxing and 

 renovation of the old unmounted specimens. Many hundreds of 

 these birds have thus been converted into excellent skin specimens, 

 while the cases have been thoroughlj' cleansed as the work continued. 

 All of the lower groups of birds, comprising those of large size, 

 have been worked over in this way, as well as the whole series of 

 Picarise, most of the Clamatores, and one or two families of the 

 'Oscines, .so that the work will be easily completed early in the coming 

 year. 



The Conservator took up each family of the water birds as the 

 relaxing was completed and arranged them systematically, reidentifj^- 

 ing many specimens and checking them up in Sharpe's Hand List. 

 He also interpolated in the collection some .5,000 specimens that have 

 been acquired during past years but not systematically arranged 

 for lack of cases, a need that was met this year by the addition of ten 

 double-sized metal storage cases. 



Iron-pipe racks were also erected for holding the cases in place of 

 the temporary wooden racks previously in use, while the fronts of 

 all the cases have been painted cream color, which gives them a much 

 neater appearance and adds materially to the light in the alcoves. 

 The floor of the room has also been painted with cemitite, which has 

 hardened the concrete and stopped the constant wearing away of 

 the surface in the form of fine dust. 



The removal of certain old wooden cases will permit the arrange- 

 ment of the local collection to much better advantage. 



A number of additions have been made during the j'ear to the local 

 exhibition collection, and others are in the course of preparation. 

 No rearrangement or further reduction of the general exhibition 

 collection has been possible, but with the acquisition of additional 

 storage cases it is hoped in the coming year to unmount a number of 

 duplicates and arrange the remaining specimens to much better 

 advantage. 



There have l)een a number of very important accessions to the 

 study collection during the year, notable among which were two 

 hundred and thirty-seven West African birds, obtained from George 




710 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



L. Bates, and four hundred and fifty specimens from Santa Marta, 

 Colombia. These added many species not heretofore represented. 



The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club and Penn.sylvania 

 Audubon Society have held their meetings regularly at the Academy 

 and have done much to stimulate interest in the department, while 

 numerous ornithologists from other institutions have made use of 

 the collections. 



At the annual meeting of the Section, held December 4, 1913, the 

 foUowmg officers were elected for the ensuing year:
