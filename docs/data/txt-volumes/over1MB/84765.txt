PROCEEDINGS 



OF THE 



ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES 



OF PHILADELPHIA. 



January 1, 1850. 

 Dr. Morton President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read, dated New York, December, 1849, accompanying 

 the donation made this evening of the Python, from Mr. Sandwith 

 Drinker, of Hong Kong, China. 



Also a letter from Mr. J. M. llichardson, of London, dated November 

 30, 1849, desiring information of a mode of transmitting to the 

 Academy certain Nos. of the Journal of the Indian Archipelago. 



Dr. Morton, having resigned the Chair to Mr. Ashmead, read a 

 continuation of his Memoir on the size of the Brain in the various 

 races and families of Man ; which was referred to the Committee on 

 the previous portions of the paper. 



A communication was read from Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Corres- 

 pondent of the Academy, dated December 21, 1849, desiring to be 

 considered as a Member from that date. 



January \iith. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Dr. Morton read a continuation of his paper on the size of the 

 Brain in the various races of Man, which was referred to the Com- 

 mittee on the previous portions. 



He then followed with some remarks on the volume of the brain in 

 the savage tribes, which he stated to be greater than in the half 

 civilized races of Mexico and Peru. He mentioned some facts proving 

 the antiquity of the characteristics of the several groups of the human 

 race, and exhibited some plates from the forthcoming work of Dr. 

 Lepsius, representing purely Egyptian forms copied from bas-reliefs 

 in tombs at the base of the great Pyramid, dating back 3400 years 

 before Christ. Also some copies of pictures in temples more than 

 2000 years later, still exhibiting the same well marked characters of 



PROCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OF PHILADELPHIA. — VOL. V. NO. I. 1 




2 [Jan. 



the race : the greater the antiquity, the luorc decided were tLtse 

 characters. 



Dr. Morton thought that it would be now admitted that at the 

 earlicHt period known, the groups of the human family presented at 

 great diversity an at present. The Egyptian crania in his collection, 

 taken from the identical tombs referred to, at the base of tbo great 

 Pyramid, as well as those from Thebes and Memphis, when compared 

 with the figures in Dr. Lepsius' plates, exhibited a most marked resem- 

 blance. The Egyptian tombs, although occupied by successive familiefi, 

 still contained the original occupants, and in all places presented 

 skulls possessing the same peculiarities of type. The modern Egyptian 

 Fellahs are the old Egyptians crossed with the Arabs. The skull of 

 the old Egyptian cannot be confounded with that of any other race. 



January 22d. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair.

 ledging the receipt of Part 3, Vol. 1, New Series of the Journal. 



From the Principal Librarian of the British Museum, returning 

 acknowledgments for Nos. 9 and 10, Vol. 4, of the Proceedings. 



From the Corresponding Secretary of the National Institute at 

 Washington, acknowledging the receipt of Nos. 9, 10, and 11, Vol. 4, 

 of Proceedings. 



Dr. Morton, in confirmation of som« remarks made on several pre- 

 vious occasions, on the characteristic conformation of the Egyptian 

 cranium, exhibited several skulls from his collection, taken from 

 tombs dating upwards of 3000 years before the Christian Era. These 

 skulls showed a remarkable delicacy of structure of the whole 

 cranio-facial region ; the cranium being of an elongated oval form, 

 the facial angle averaging 78'^, and the internal capacity 80 cubic 

 inches; in the last respect corresponding to the modern Fellah of the 

 Nile. 



The expression of the bones of the face of the ancient Egyptian is 

 neither European nor Asiatic, but peculiar, sui gencHs. The Arab- 

 Egyptian, or Fellah of the present day, is the Arab engrafted on the 

 Ancient Egyptian, and dates from the sixth century of our Era. AH 

 the Coptic beads of the present period have some negro characters : 

 they are those of the population of the towns which are notoriously 

 licentious. The Fellahs, or rural population, are free from this 

 taint.

Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy read the following, being a report by Prof. Haldeman, 

 Chairman of the Committee on Entomology, on the progress of that 

 science during the past year. 



Report on the Progress of Entomology in the United States during the year 1849. 



By S. S. Haldeman. 



Whilst the progress of Eatomology during the year 1849 has been sufficiently 

 encouraging, it cannot be doubted that it would advance more rapidly if there 

 were one or more general works upon the subject, adapted to this country. 

 The student is now retarded either by the extent of the subject, or because he 

 cannot consult standard collections, works, or figures of American genera and 

 species ; whilst such as have passed through the preliminary difficulties, gen- 

 erally prefer original research to the preparation of works which partake in some 

 degree of the nature of compilations ; and on account of the expense of figures, 

 authors usually limit them to their own discoveries. 



Another cause which retards the natural sciences in general, in a country 

 where the amount of material to be investigated is extensive, is the want of 

 instruction in them in our educational institutions, in but few of which their 

 claims to a place among the sciences are acknowledged. Such causes tend to 

 limit the number of observers, and must be taken into consideration in esti- 

 mating the condition of certain sciences in this country.

 Prof. Qibbes of Charleston. 



A paper was read from Mr. Conrad, describing new species of fresh 

 water shells from Arkansas and from Australia, and referred to a com- 

 mittee, consisting of Mr. Phillips, Dr. Wilson and Dr. Griffith. 



Dr. Leidy offered the following remarks : 



Dr. Leidy stated it was now eighteen months since he had sought for Ento- 

 phyta within living animals, having been previously impressed with the belief 

 of their existence upon reflecting upon the essential conditions of life. Four 

 months since he exhibited to the Academy numerous drawings, and specimens 

 of entophyta obtained from living animals ; he now exhibited others. 



The essential conditions of Life are five in number, viz., a germ, nutritive 

 matter, air, water, and heat. Tlie four latter undoubtedly exist in the interior 

 of living animals, animal or entozoa germs also are well known to exist, and 

 it was rendered extremely probable that vegetable germs would also exist, and 

 with them all the conditions necessary to vegetable growth. Plants have been 

 very frequently observed growing upon the exterior of animals and less fre- 

 quently upon the interior, most usually upon diseased surfaces, but the growth 

 of such parasites had not been pointed out as a normal and common condition 

 as in the case of entozoa. 



Dr. L. next reviewed the theory of generation. He inclines to the opinion 

 that sexual elements are absolutely necessary for the perpetuation of germs. 

 He considers the alternation of generation in certain animals no objection to 

 the law, for after successive developments an admixture of the sexual elements 

 is observed to be necessary. The reproduction among Cryptogamia may pro- 

 bably often exhibit phenomena analogous to the alternation of generation of 

 animals, but universally he thinks it will be discovered that a true sexual ad- 

 mixture takes place in every species of thes#plants at some period of their life. 

 According to the observations of Schimper it is necessary among the mosses. 

 From an observation made by Klencke, upon a fungus which grew upon a dis- 

 eased surface, Dr. L. thinks that sexual admixture would be discovered to take 

 place in the 7n3/ceZj!/ra. In numerous instances it had been observed among the 

 Algae. He stated he thought he had noticed the process in Achyla prolifera, and 

 gave adescription of the phenomena. He finally considers that science is on the 

 eve of demonstrating the existence of a law "that an admixture of sexual ele- 

 ments is necessary for the perpetuation of specific life germs." 



He then exhibited numerous elaborate drawings of new entophyta observed 

 growing in the ventriculus of Passalus cornutus, aremrakable one growing in a 

 honey -like liquid in the proventriculus of the larva of Arctia Isabella, another 




8 [Feb. 



from Acheta abbroviata, etc. He remarked that when such plants were fonnd 

 in animals they were usually very abundant. 



Dr. L. thou stated that very slight modifications in the five essential condi- 

 tions of life were sufficient to produce the vast variety of living beings upon the 

 globe. As an instance, he mentioned he had lying on his table a saucer with a 

 cork bottom, in which lay a partly dissected Passalus comutus half immersed 

 in water. Two days afterwards he noticed upon the part of the insect above 

 the water a quantity of Mucor mucedo ? growing, and from the part within the 

 water numerous fine, stiff filaments, which upon examination proved to be 

 Achyla prolifera ; upon the cork around the insect grew a third genus, con- 

 sisting of fine cottony filameuts, which were articulated, of which he exhibited 

 a drawing : and upon the insect at the surface of the water, but not within the 

 latter, grew a fourth genus, of which he also exhibited a drawing. 



He also stated he had had the good fortune of observing in a single morning 

 all the stages of development of Achyla prolifera growing from some individuals 

 of Ascarides which had been lying in a dish of water for a few days. 



In reply to some remarks made by members, Dr. Leidy said he could not 

 admit the doctrine of spontaneous generation, but rather thought modifications 

 in the essential conditions of life favorable to the development of different and 

 always pre-existing germs derived from a parent. 



February \^lh. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Mr. J. T. IJccker, dated Paris, 10th December, 



1849, proposing exchanges with the Academy in Entomology. Referred 

 to the Committee on Entomology. 



Also a letter from II. Lecoq, dated Clermon-fcrrand, January 10, 



1850, proposing exchanges in Conchology with the Academy, or 

 with individual members of the Society. Preferred to the Committee 

 on Conchology. 



Dr. Leidy offered the following observations : 



Dr. Leidy presented to the examination of the Society a colored and several 

 other drawings of what he termed an entophytic forest, taken from a portion of 

 the mucous membrane of the ventriculus of Passalus comutus. He remarked 

 that at least six species of entophyta were found growing upon the mucous 

 membrane of the ventriculus of P. comutus, which were often present in great 

 quantity, frequently some thousands, and which from their number, polymor- 

 phous appearance of several species, and attachment to various appendages of 

 the mucous membrane, resembled very strikingly a miniature Brazilian forest, 

 which was heightened in some degree by the existence of a nematoid worm, 

 which recalled to mind the idea of one of the serpents of such a forest. 



A somewhat similar drawing he exhibited, taken from the small intestine of 

 Julus marginatus. 



Other drawings were also presented. Dr. L. stated that among his collection 

 of living Julides, he had a number of times observed individuals to become dull 




1850.] 9 



in color, and become almost motionless, which phenomena were followed by 

 the death of the animal. It occurred to him that, in such a state, there might 

 be exhibited some change in the character of its entophyta, as usually found 

 in the active condition of the animal. Upon removing the intestine of an in- 

 dividual which had just died, he noticed that the entozoa which usually oc- 

 cupied the small intestine, had passed into the rectum, and upon the surface 

 of the mucous membrane of the former, was developed a new plant. This is 

 an oblate spheroidal body, white in color, translucent, embossed upon the sur- 

 face, and presenting, when viewed by transmitted light, some resemblance to a 

 minute bleached shell of an Echinus ; by reflected light, it resembled a minute, 

 white Lycoperdon. This plant was strewed aU over the mucous membrane, but 

 grew in greatest quantity along the course of filaments of Enterobrus, which 

 appeared attached to the mucous membrane throughout their length by it. 

 When compressed it opened, and spread into several leaf-like segments, and 

 exuded a clear fluid with faint granules. He thought that probably this plant 

 might be another stage in the existence of Enterobrus, for in the large number 

 of individuals of Julus which he had examined, upwards of 130, although he 

 had observed the development of Enterobrus from spore-like bodies, even to 

 the formation of what he supposed to be the sporangia, yet he had never been 

 able to detect the formation of spores, and when he saw this new plant envelop- 

 ing the Enterobrus filaments, he suspected that there might be a phenomenon 

 here presented analogous to the alternation of generation in certain animals, 

 but had not yet satisfied himself that such was the case. 



He also stated he had discovered a fourth species of Enterobrus in Polydes- 

 mus virginiensis, and another entophyte analogous to Enterobrus growing in 

 Polydesmus granulatus. The latter difiers from Enterobrus in having numer- 

 ous globular cells at the free extremity of the principal cell. He adverted to 

 the several theories of cell formation, and said that in the last mentioned plant, 

 in the development of the globular terminal cells, the division of the perma- 

 nent cell wall followed the division of the cell contents. In conclusion, he ob- 

 served, that these matters would be more fully treated of hereafter, in a me- 

 moir which he was preparing on the subject. 



February l^tk. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



The, Committee on Conchology presented a report, recommending 

 that M. Lecoq's proposition, for an exchange of shells, be declined. 

 Adopted.

 reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings.

Dr. Morton presented the following letter from Elliott Cresson, Esq., 

 of Philadelphia, addressed to the members of the Academy, dated 

 March 5th. 



" It will doubtless be gratifying to you to learn that the attention of acieniific 

 men is turned, with deep interest, upon the long neglected continent of Africa : 

 and it is equally due to you and to the distinguished gentlemsn who have made 

 so liberal an otFer, to state that Hon. John Short, of Cincinnati, and Professor 

 Charles Short, of Louisville, have most munificently offered to bear all the ex- 

 penses of a botanical mission to Africa, provided a person of proper zeal and 

 other qualifications can be obtained for the service. Professor Christy, of Oxford, 

 Ohio, has also expressed to us his wish to make a geological survey of Africa." 



The letter was, on motion, referred to the Zoological Committee. 

 The following, from the same, was also read. 



Extract from a lefter from Senator Stephen A. Benson to Elliott Cresson, dated 

 Bassa Cove, Republic of Liberia, October 28<A, 1849. 



" I had almost forgotten to tender you my thanks for the pamphlet forwarded 

 to me, containing some observations on the Hippopotamus Liberiensis. This 

 .H.nimal inhabits all the larger rivers of Liberia, and I have known seven in all to 

 be killed by the natives liviner near the St. Joha's river, but have never seen but 

 one myself. This one was shot by a native in 1835, on an island in this river, 

 opposite Bexley, and so far as I can now remember, it corresponded with .the 

 description given by Dr. Morton and his correspondents. The natives say that 

 they are to be frequently seen upon the islands opposite and above Bexley."'

On leave granted, the Zoological Committee, to which was referred 

 the Messrs. Short's communication to Mr. Elliott Creseon, of Philadel-

 at this time by the Academy.

Calalogtte of the Crustacea in the Cabinet of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, Avgnst 20th, 1847, tvilh notes on the most remarkable. 



By Prof. Lewis R. Gibbks, Charleston, South Carolina. 



Tn August, 1847, the collection of Crustacea in the Cabinet of the Academy 

 ■was kindly laid open to me for inspection and study ; and as the specimens were 

 not all labelled, I endeavored to make some return for the favor by labelling 

 the whole collection, as far as practicable, in the few days I spent in the city, 

 in a mode uniform with that I adopted for the collection belonging to the Bos- 

 ton Society of Natural History. No labels were httached, of course, to those 




1850]. 



23 



specimens described by Mr. Say and Dr. Randall, which retain the original 

 labels. The catalogne given below, with the notes on the principal species, 

 were made during the examination of the collection, and I had intended to 

 communicate them to the Academy soon after my return home, but several 

 circumstances, which it is hardly necessary to mention, prevented my doing so 

 as early as I intended, and I ofiFer them now, as I believe no communication 

 has yet been made to the Academy of the extent of their collection. The cata- 

 logue includes the Podophthalmian Crustacea only, as there were but few speci- 

 mens belonging to the other subdivisions, and those not all in good condition. 



In a few cases I have had to correct the determinations of Dr. Randall. The 

 necessity for these corrections I communicated to Dr. R. after my return home, 

 and begged that he would himself correct his own errors ; but his distance from 

 the specimens, and his present engagements, have induced him to entrust that 

 office to me. I have therefore made the requisite corrections, influenced by 

 that friendly consideration for Dr. R. which a consciousness of one's own lia- 

 bility to error should ever induce for the errors of others. 



The nomenclature adopted is in general that of Milne Edwards.

NOTES. 



2. Lepidoptera calcarata. All that remains of Say's original specimen is the 

 stomachal region of the carapace, with the eyes and rostrum attached. This 

 was found in Charleston harbor; a second specimen has not, as far as I know, 

 been yet obtained. 



5. Libiuia afifinis, Randall, hardly appears to differ from L. dubia, M. Edw. 



6. Lissa fissirostra is tlie name under which Say described this spec-ies. Son-e 




2G [March, 



of our nnturnlists regard it as identical with ITyas coarctata of the Rritich 

 coasts. I liave had no opportunity of comparing specimens from both shores 

 of the Atlantic, but the American species appears to me to resemble most 

 Uy&8 aranea, judging from the figure in Ilerbst's work. 



9. Milhrax spinosissiraus. The specimen in the collection is of unusual size. 

 Carapace 7 inches in length, as many in breadlii,Hnd 3 inches thick ; hand and 

 linger 7 inches long, '2^ broad ; whole length of one of the first pair of ftet 13 

 inches. 



12. Pericera cornuto This specimen has been described by Dr. Randall 

 (Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci.., vol. viii. p. 108) as Chorinus armatus. It does not 

 belong to the genus Chorinus, as the orbits of the eyes are not incomplete, hs 

 they are in that genus, but embrace the peduncle of the eye on all sides like a 

 tube, allowing no other motion to the eye than that of retraction or protrusion. 

 On comparison. Dr. R.'s description will be found to agree in general with that 

 given by M. Edwards of Pericera cornuta, (Hist. Crust., tome I. p. 33.'j,) and a 

 reference to the figure given in Hughes' Nat. Hist., of Barbadoes, pi. 25, fig. 3, 

 or to Herbst, pi 59, fig. 6, will complete the proof. 



13 and 14. Epialtus Nuttalli and productus Randall appear to be new and 

 well marked species. 



22. Pseudocarcinus mercenaria is the Cancer mercenaria of Say, (Jour. Acad- 

 Nat. Sci., vol. i. p. 448,) abundant along our southern coast- It is referred by 

 M. Edwards, with some doubt, to' the genus Xantho of Leach, (M. Edw. Hist 

 Crust., tome i. p. 399,) but I have no hesitation in referring it to his own genua 

 Pseudocarcinus, and am disposed to think that he had it before hira when writ- 

 ing his description of Pseudocarcinus ocellatus, (op. cit., p. 409.) His descrip- 

 tion applies in every particular, but is short. The country of his specimens he 

 says is unknown. 



25. Platycarcinus productus, Randall, is a distinct species from the three 

 others known. 



28. Trapezia cymodoce. The specimens in the collection agree exactly with 

 (juerin's figure, (Voy. Coq. Crust., pi. 1. fig. 4.) M. Edwards' remarks are 

 very just with regard to the difference between Guerin's Trapezia cymodoce, 

 and the Cancer cymodoce of Herbst. 



33. Lupa cnbraria. The crab of our southern coast described by Say as Lupa 

 maculata, (J. A. N. S., vol. i. p. 445,) appears by Edwards' description and 

 figure, (op. cit., tome 1, p. 452, pi. 17,* fig. 1,) to be same as Lamarck's Por- 

 tunus cribrarius, (Anim. sans Vert., tome v., p. 259, and 2me. edit., t v., p. 

 47(3.) Say's paper was read Dec. 1st, 1818, and Lamarck's fifth vokiroe was 

 published, as declared by the title page, in July, 1818, and his name has right 

 of priority, and I have, therefore, adopted it. 



35. Lupo pelagica. This specimen has Say's original label affixed, and is 

 doubtless one of the specimens described by him in the Jour. Acad., vol. i. p. 

 97. It is not the L. pelagica of M. Edwards, and does not appear to be the 

 young of the L. dicantha common along our coast; but further examination is 

 requisite to determine what claims it has to be considered new. 



* He refers, through mistake, to pi.. 18, fig. 1. 




1850.] 27 



39. Potamia latifrons, Randall, is distinct from Boscia deutata, M. Edw. 

 Potamia, as generic name, ought to take precedence of Boscie. 



40. Orthostoma dentata, Randall, forms a genus distinct from the others of 

 the same group. 



49. Macrophthalmus compressipes, Randall, is a distinct species, and is the 

 same as the M. podophthalmus figured in the Voyage of the Bronite. Priority of 

 publication must determine which name shall prevail. The text of the work 

 I have not seen. 



53. Grapsus eruentatus. The individuals iu the Collection of the Academy, 

 belonging to this species, were erroneously regarded by Dr. Randall as new, anl 

 were described by him as G. longipes, in the Journal of the Academy, (vol. 

 viii. p. 125.) It was doubtless a mistaken supposition that they were brought 

 from Surinam, as stated p. 126, and this error probibly misled Dr. R. 



55. Grapsus rudis, M. Edw., is the same as G. hirtus, Randall, (J. A. N. S., 

 vol. viii. p. 124.) Milne-Edwards' name has priority. With him I regard G. 

 rudis as distinct from G. pictus, though it differs only in the following particulars : 

 the carapace is clothed with numerous but di-tant transverse lines of hairs ; 

 the front is not so perpendicularly turned down ; the four lobes of the front are 

 more tuberculous, and the limbs smaller when com[)ared with the body. There 

 is but one specimen in the collection, but that is in good condition. 



56 and 57. Pachygrapsus crassipes and P parallelus appear to be distinct 

 from the described species of the genus Grapsus. 



66. Guaia ornata. This is a very distinct and pretty species of the genus 

 Guaia, described by Dr. Randall as Ilia ornata, (J. A. X. S., vol. viii. p. 129.) 

 but it really belongs to the genus to which I have referred it. This error, of 

 confounding the two genera. Ilia and Guaia, has been co-ninitted by others be- 

 sides Dr. R., until specimens really belonging to the genus Ilia fell into their 

 hands, when a distinctive character is at once perceiveil in the peculiar con- 

 torted form of the hands iu this genus. For want of af.ention to this piiu', 

 Myrafugaxand Guaia punctata have been confouuded with Ilia punctata, m;triy 

 points in the description of each being common. 



68. Ranina dentata. Two fine specimens. Dimensions of largest : carapace 

 4J inches long, 4J broad; carapace and abdomen extended, 7 inches; breadt:i 

 of hand, finger excluded, Ij inch, including finger, 2 J inches; length of thumb 

 or moveable finger, I^ inch ; length of one of the first pair of feet, thumb ex- 

 tended, is 7 inches. 



70. Blepharipoda occidentalis, Randall. A well marked genus. Tlie indi- 

 vidual is a female ; abdomen with appendages, first pair of ftet cheliform ; hence 

 it is near Albunea, but quite distinct. 



74. Porcellana sociata. Say. In Say's article (J. A. X. S., vol. i. p. 456) the 

 name of this species is given P. soriata. Say's original specimen is still in the 

 collection of the Academy, but the label could not be found to determine how he 

 wrote the name ; there can be butlittie doubt that the name as printed is a typo- 

 graphical error arising from an imperfection in the manuscript, and that Leach, 

 Desmarest, and Milne Edwards are right in regarding sociata as the true specific 

 name; an imperfectly formed c connected with the preceding letter being easily 

 mistaken for one of the manuscript forms of r. Another example of deviation 




-^ [Marcb, 



from the original orthogrnphj is furnished \iy Leach's genus Lupa, but in this 

 case the deviation is unjustifiable. In Leach's article Crustaceology, in the 

 Edinb. Encycl., he uses Lupa throughout, and Desmarest does the same in the 

 C'onsid. Gen. Crust. Milne Edwards, misled apparently by the orthography of 

 the mime in French, Lujiec, erroneously uses Luper iu his Hiat. Nat. Crust, 

 tool i. p. 445, text and note,) while in the references in the note^ in the following 

 pages, he uses Lupa; in his notes to the second edition of Lamarck's Anim. 

 jians Vert. tom. v. p. 47.'?, he gives Leach's genus as Lupea, while in the refer- 

 ences to his own work (Hist. Nat. Crust.) on page 478, he uses thrice Lupa, and 

 once Lupea. Lastly, in the Appendix to Leach's own article in Edin. Encyc . 

 the genus is called Lima! 



89. Ibachus anturclicus. One individual marked as " brought from Santa Cruz 

 by R. E. Griffith," agrees with Milne Edwards' character for 1. antarcticus, the 

 spiue being present on the fifth pair of feet, the absence of which marks his I- 

 I'arrae, a native of the Antilles. Is 1. Parrje a distinct species? or is it only 

 imperfect!}' distinguished by the character he assigns to it? 



98. Alpheus dispiir, Randall, is hardly distinct from A. brevirostris, M. Edw. 



101. Hippolyte gracilipes. The specimen thus labelled was in bad condition, 

 but certainly belongs to the genus Palemon : probably some interchange of 

 labels had taken place. 



103. Palemon Gaudichaudii, M. Edw. Two fine specimens of this species of 

 Milne Edwards, fir.~t brought from Chili by Giudichaud. 



111. Squilla enipusH. The specimen I labelled thus, was said to be brought 

 from the Pacific, and does not perceptibly differ from S. empusa. Say, from the 

 Atlantic coast ; if it really came from the Pacific, direct comparison with 

 S. empusa of our Coast ought to be made, which I was not able to do for want 

 of specimens of the latter at hand. 



113. Squilla Cerisii. This specimen was brought from the Pacific, and agreed 

 with .M. Edward's description of the S. cerisii of Roux, inhabiting the Mediter- 

 ranean ; direct comparison is necessary to determine in what points they really 

 differ It is more probably the same as S. Lcssonii, of Gudrin. 



Thf re were also some eight or ten undetermined species, and several of Say's 

 original epecimens of the lower orders of the Crustacea. 



Several of the species described by Dr. Randall were wanting, and have been 

 omitted of course in the preceding catalogue.

Prof. Gibbes in stating that several of Dr. Randall's specimens had been lost, 

 has overlooked Xantlio intonsus Rand., which is still in the cabinet of the 

 Academy. But one other species is omitted in Prof. Gibbes' list, Astacus

April 2d. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Lyceum of Natural History of New York, 

 dated March 2Gth, 1850, acknowledging the receipt of Vol. 3. No .3, 

 and Vol. 4, Nos. 9 — 12, of the Proceedings, and Vol. 8, Pari 2, first 

 series of the Journal. 



Also a letter from Mr. James Deane, offering to prepare for publica- 

 tion in the Journal of the Academy, a paper on the fossils of the new 

 red sandstone of the Connecticut valley, lleferfed to the Publicaiion 

 Committee. 



Dr. Morton, on resigning the chair to Mr. Vaux, then read a further 

 continuation of his paper on the size of the brain in the various races 

 of man. 



The following is an analysis of this portion of the Memoir : — 

 In regard to the diversity of the human species, some ethnologists account 

 for it by supposing changes to be eflFected by varieties in food, vicissitudes 

 of climate, and other physical agents. Others again attribute the differences 

 to the rise of accidental varieties, by which individuals have been produced, 

 from whom, at first, tribes, then races and nations have .sprung in succession. 

 If, therefore, we suppose all mankind to have been originally white, the 

 hypothesis would necessarily require that negroes must be a mere accidental 

 variety. This is Dr. Prichard's view cf the case. 




1850.] ,31 



Dr. Morton said analogical reasoning, based upon the known changes which 

 occur among the lower animals, would lead us into error if applied to Man. For 

 instance, the Reindeer of Lapland do not change in the slightest particular after 

 long domestication. The Peacock, also, has not varied during thousands of 

 years, unless some few tints originally perfectly blue may have become green- 

 ish. Other instances of this kind might be enumerated. 



Again, some animals in a very short time, in two or three generations, become 

 entirely changed in color, as the Guinea pig and the turkey. Sometimes even 

 the anatomical structure undergoes material changes under the influence of do- 

 mestication ; for instance, in the common pigeon, ( Columba livia,) the sheep and 

 the dog. He particularly directed attention to the fact that some animals in the 

 ivild stateundQTgo remarkable changes ; the Black squirrel and the Red squirrel 

 for instance, while some other species of the same genus are unchangeable. 



Some animals are not less remarkable for being liable to change than others 

 are remarkable for resisting every impression from vicissitude or difference of 

 climate and other causes. For instance the Bengal tiger, Felis Tigris, is pre- 

 cisely the same in every tint, whether inhabiting the frozen shores of Lake 

 Baikal in Siberia, or the jungle of Ceylon. The greatest extremes of climate 

 appear alike congenial to this animal. 



In the northwestern province of Delhi, Bishop Heber saw a shaggy Elfphant ; 

 and he states that in the course of one or two winters, dogs brought from Europe 

 become woolly in that region, and even horses undergo a similar change ; but 

 this tendency does not extend to the human race, for the inhabitants are re- 

 markable for the length and straightness of their hair. 



Dr. Morton also adverted to the fact that the wool of sheep becomes long 

 and hairj" in Guinea, where human hair is naturally woolly. 



From these and many other facts he inferred that causes which produce 

 changes in the lower animals cannot change man. 



Differences in modes of life have been considered productive of changes in 

 man. But if we examine the aborigines of America, from Canada to Terra del 

 Fuego, we seek in vain for a woolly head ; men are found with skins lighter or 

 darker in color, but all are Indians in every characteristic, and this through- 

 out a range of 10,000 miles. He questions whether any one ever saw a true 

 Indian who could be mistaken for a being of any other race. 



In Europe we trace families through many generations, either living in the 

 extremes of affluence or of misery, yet never does one race merge into another, 

 nor does a new race rise up among them. 



Mr. W. B.Hodgson, Consul of the United States at Algiers, states there is a 

 tribe of white men supposed to be derived from the lost tribes of Israel, now ex- 

 isting in the heart of the Negro territory ; yet they have acquired no negro 

 peculiarity, but are remarkable for all the characteristics of the while race — 

 skin, hair and form. This is one of many similar examples. 



Again, how does it happen that no Negro has ever been born as an acci- 

 dental variety, among the Caucasian, Mongolian or other races ? 



It is vain to seek for the origin of Negro races in morbid change. No morbid 

 change tends to perpetuity, but, on the contrary, it wears out sooner or later. 



Dr. Morton conceives that there is a constant tendency in nature to restore aqd 

 preserve a primitive type. A black man and white woman, or a black woman 




32 [April, 



and white raan, produce a hybrid offspring, and that hybrid reprodiicim^ in 

 turn, one or other of the origitiiil types will sometimes occur in such progeny. 



In Peru some Spanish fauiilies, two or three centuries since, intermarried 

 with the Inca, or purely Indian race; and notwithstanding no further cross 

 with the Indian stock has subsequently occurred in these families, the Indian 

 ih:;racteristi(s are said occasionally to reappear even at the present time. 



Asiatics may have landed ages ago upon this continent ; but if they did so, 

 they have all been swallowed up and lost, in the indigenous population ; and no 

 unequivocal trace of them remains in our Indian population. Before the landing 

 of Columbus, as well as since, the New World has presented every possible vi- 

 cissitude of climate which could be supposed to produce a negro or any other 

 race, but not an individual of such a race has ever appeared. 



Dr. M. added, that such was the effect of the blending of dissimilar types on the 

 American continent, that he could produce, from among the colored population 

 of this city, many of the diversified forms and colors that e.xist in Africa itself. 

 In the case of seven species of domestic fowl, Temminck has shown that five 

 out of the seven cross among each other, and produce prolific hybrids, and 

 then branch out into innumerable varieties : and the varieties of the domestic 

 pigeon differ more among each other than some distinct genera of other animals- 

 Domestic cattle if bred in and in, dwindle. In Paraguay it is necessary to 

 refresh the stock by importations from other pastures. Other domestic cat- 

 tle also exhibit this peculiarity of hybrids. 



If mulattoes were bred in and in, without resorting to the parent stock, they 

 would soon become extinct. 



A circuhir was read from the Committee of receptinn of the National 

 Pacific KailroacI Convention, now in Session in Philadelphia, askina: 

 permission of the Academy for the members of the Convention to visit 

 the Museum; whereupon a resolution was adopted granting the desired 

 permission. 



April dfh. 



Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy remarked that crystalline bodies had been detected in most of the 

 tissues of many plants, but that their occurrence in animal tissues was much 

 more rare. Thedepositof earthy salts in many tissues, such as bone, enamel and 

 shell, though analogous, was not homologous with crystallization. The earthy 

 deposit in the shell of the egg of many animals is probably an instance of true 

 crystallization within an animal tissue, for in those auimals which have eggs 

 with a semi-membranous shell, as many helices. &c ,we can detect the carbonate 

 of lime deposited in the form of regular rhombohedrons. He stated that he late- 

 ly met with a remarkable instance of crystallization within animal organic cells. 

 In examining the stomach of the larva of Arctia Isabella, a Lepidopterous insect, 

 he found that the nucleus of every epithelial cell contained an octohedral crystal, 

 the axes of which measured about the l-3750th of an inch. The cells were color- 

 less, (not white,) containing some f-iiutly granular matter, which, in many in- 

 stances, was collected into distinct rounded masses. The nuclei were round, 




1850.] ■ 38 



elliptical, or lenticular, transparent, and measured the 1 - IS^eth of an inch when 

 round. The following day, upon exanaining some of the cells, which had been 

 preserved between two slips of glass hermetically seale,dtae crystals had dis- 

 appeared, and the nuclei had become distinctly and opaquely granular. Aceiic 

 acid rendered the granular matter more translucent, and brought into view the 

 nuclelous, which, not being visible the preceding day, probably served as the 

 nucleus of the crystalline body. The animal, when examined, was in a state of 

 hybernation, at which period, organic activity is reduced, which would predia- 

 pose to the crystallization of any salt in solution in an organic cell ; for ilappefiTs 

 that the frequency of the existence of crystalline bodief? in the organic kingdom, 

 is, to a considerable extent, dependent upon an inverse ratio of activity of life. 



Dr. Morton then resumed the subject of the plurality of origin of 

 the human race. In evidence of its orthodoxy, and o; its being in 

 accordance with the liberal interpretation of the Pentateuch, he adduced 

 the last edition of the work of the Hev. Dr. John Pye Smith, on the 

 Relations of Geolosy and Revelation. Ihis author dtaigtiates the 

 DAnge as a local phenomenon, and circumscribes its limits, (xeolugir^ts 

 are in general convinced that it was not uni>?eisal. 



As regards the opinion that the various races of the human family 

 were primordially distinct,, Dr. Morton is convinced that the tendency 

 of investigation goes every year to strengthen it. lu other words, Man 

 was aboriginally suited by his Creator for the various localities in 

 which he has placed him. Dr. M. also read some interesting quotations 

 from Dr. Pye Smith's work, in further support of this opinion. Mr. 

 White, of England, fifty years since, also maintained that the plurality 

 of the human race was in accordance with the text of Genesis, and Mr. 

 E. King strenuously takes the same ground. In 1825, Rev. Dr. 

 Thomas Arnold remarks, in a letter to Archbishop Wheatley, " that he 

 fears the physiological question is not yet settled." 



Dr. Morton distinctly disclaimed any desire to enter into coutroversy 

 on the biblical view of the question j but lie was ijiad »o show, from 

 clerical authors, that the naked facts of zoological science, and :he 

 statement of Genesis, are in harmony with each other.

Descriptions of new Entophyta growing within animals. 

 By Josei-h Leidt, M. D. 



EccRiNA.* (Gen. Nov.) Characters same as Enterobryu3,f except that 

 it divides into numerous cells at the free extremity. 



Eccrina longa. Filaments long and delicate, hjaline or fairly brownish, at 

 first forming a simple curve, or a single spiral turn, and then passing in a 

 straight line to the free extremity. Peduncle very short. Frond cell usually 

 filled with globules and a few granules, except at free end, where it is usnally 

 filled with granules, to the exclusion of the globules. End cells as high as 

 thirty in number, at first consisting of elongated divisions of the frond cell 

 contents, but becoming distinct elliptical cells, from two to three times longer 

 than the breadth ; contents usually granular, occasionally with a few globules. 

 End cells finally separating from the parent. Length from three to seven 

 lines, breadth I-2000th to the l-5I7th in., not usually corresponding to the 

 length. End cells l-517th to the l-357th in. in length. 



Habitat. — Grows in very great profusion from the mucous membrane of the 

 posterior part of the intestine of Polydesmus virginienais. 



(Dr. L. exhibited to the Academy a preserved fragment of mucous membrane, 

 with filaments of this species six lines in length growing from it.) 



Eccrina monili/ornia. Filaments hyaline or yellowish, forming a double or 

 treble spiral. Peduncle short. Frond cell filled with globules and granules, 

 except towards its free extremity, where it is filled with granular matter 

 divided into distinct and separate masses, usnally a little shorter than broad, 

 and containing each a globular nucleolated nucleus. Divisions progressively 

 passing towards the end into globular cells with granular contents. Divisions 

 and globular cells from 20 to 50 in number. 



Length from 1 to H lines, breadth .average l-1500th in. Divisions of frond 

 cell contents atd globular cells from 1- 1875th l-1500th in. Nucleus of cells 

 1 3750 in. 



Habitat. — Grows in moderate quantity from the mucous membrane of the 

 intestine of 50 percent, of Polydesmus granulatus. 



Arthromitus nitidus. Filaments very long, hyaline, grows usually in twos or 

 fours, pointed at the orig^, rounded at the termination. Articuli very dis- 

 tinct, length equal to the breadth of the filament. Sporuli formed within the 

 articuli, solitary, usually oblique, oval, amorphous. 



Length 1 line by l-5000th in. broad. Spores 1-7-lllth in. long, by l-12-500lh 

 in. broad. 



Habitat — Grows in considerable quantity with a profusion of young of

Knterobyrus elcpana from the mucous membrane of the posterior portion of 

 ibe rectum of Juius inarginatus. 



Jiemiirks. — Hince I established the genus Arthromitus,* I have observed 'he 

 formation of its eporuli. These originate in the amorphous matter of the 

 articuli, apparently by a very gradual aggregation and condensation of the 

 contents. They are always single, and usually lie oblique, and frequently 

 alternate with each other iu this position in the different articuli. When tbcy 

 first appear, they are larger than when fully formed, are frequently bent, or 

 clavttte in form, and very indistinct, but, as Ihey ripen, they become more 

 regular, oval, distinct, and .juite refractile of light. Usually, they are olJserv^d 

 at the extremity of the filaments only, but frequently they are found existing 

 in the whole length of the latter. 



A species of Arthromitus, and also of Gladophylum, is found in the intestine 

 of Polydesmus virginiensis. 



The Higrocrocis intestinalis, found by Valentin in the Blatta o ientali*. 1 

 could not find in our domestic cockroach, although I found numerous simfle, 

 jihytoid, inarticulate filaments growing from an o.xyuris infesting this animal.

 fine. (With No. 46, the structure of the entire foot of the largest species of 

 Moa, is beautifully demonstrated. The phalangeal bones do not all belong to 

 this metatarsal, but they have been selected with great care by Mr. Walter Man- 

 tell, and fitted together on the spot ; the type of the original is now fortunately 

 known from two perfect feet, not quite so large as the above, having been dug 

 up, standing erect in the tertiary bed at Waingongoro, as if the Moa had be- 

 come swamped in the bog and perished. Nos. 46 and 47 arranged together

 illustration of the foot of the gigantic Dinornis hitherto obtained.) 48, Anolher 

 magnificent specimen of the Tarso-metatarsal of Din. giganteus, or ingens. 

 (The reference of separate bones to the several speci'^s assumed by Prof Owen,

An extract of a letter from J. Sharpe Macleay, Esq., dated Elizabeth 

 Bay, near Sydney, 12th October, 1849, addressed to Dr. Morton, 

 stating that he had transmitted to the latter " the cast of a fossil fish, 

 illustrating the highest animal form yet discovered in the vast coal 

 measures of the Eastern Coast of New Holland. The head was want- 

 ing, but from analogy it most nearly resec?.bles the modern Lej)i(Iosteus. 

 The specimen was found at Newcastle, a port about sixty miles north 

 of Sydney, and noted for its coal mines. 



Two other specimens of Sauroids of a distinct genus have been found 

 at Paramalta, an inland town about fourteen miles from Sydney. 



These are all the remains of Vertebrata yet found in strata of an 

 earlier date than the Tertiary period." 



Mr. Macleay also proposed to exchange Silurian or carbonaceous 

 fossils, or plants and seeds of the colony, for those of this country, and 

 enclosed a list of the latter which would be desirable. The list was 

 referred to the Botanical Comntittee with power to act. 



Dr. Morton also presented a communication addressed to him by P. 

 A. Browne, Esq., dated Philadelphia, April 26, 1850, stating that he 

 had been recently engaged in making an examination of the hair and 

 portions of the scalp of some human heads, from Pachamahac and from 

 Arica and Pisco, in Peru, and on comparing them with those of our 

 modern Indians, he was prepared to demonstrate that they all belong 

 to the same species, that viz. with cylindrical straight lank hair, which 

 issues out of the epidermis at an acute angle, but the coloring matter is 

 in the cortex, or in the cortex and intermediate fibres.

 Dr. Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Joel Y. Schelly, Esq., dated Hereford, Berks 

 County, Pennsylvania, April 7, 1850, addressed to Dr. Leidy, announc- 

 ing that he had transmitted to the Academy all the fossil remains in 

 his possession, found in Upper Milford, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, 

 in 1848. Some other specimens in the hands of other individuals, he 

 would also endeavor to obtain for the Society. 



On motion of Dr. Leidy the thanks of the Academy were presented 

 to Mr. Schelly for the collection ; which Dr. Leidy stated had been re- 

 ceived, and was now in tBe possession of the Society.

On leave granted, Mr. A'aux, on behalf of Dr. Morton, offered the 

 following resolutions: 



Hesohrd, That this Society has learned with sincere regret, the death 

 of their esteemed and venerable fellow member, Alexander Maclure, 

 at New Harmony, in Indiana, on the 9th of April last. 



Resolved, That his name should be indelibly recorded in the annals 

 of our Institution, as well for his various personal benefactions, as for 

 his faithful and literal fulfilment of those most important objects which 

 his brother, "William Maclure, had designed, but did not live to accom- 

 plish. 



Resolved, That we further cherish the memory of Alexander Ma- 

 clure for the moral excellence of his character, his exacting probity, 

 and his practical benevolence. 



The resolutions were unanimously adopted. 



Mr. Yaux read from the North American and United States Gazette, 

 the following printed letter relating to the death of Dr. "William 

 Gambel.* 



* Dr. Gambel's death was announced at a former meeting of the Academy, 

 but the information waa not sufficiently authentic to authorize any action on 

 the subject by the Academy.

Correspondence of the N. American and U. S. Gazette. 



Mountain House, Alta California, ") 

 March 25th, 1850. / 



Messrs. Editors^ — I trust you will pardon the liberty I take ia offering to the 

 citizens of Philadelphia, through your valuable paper, a tribute to the memory of 

 an eminent and worthy Philadelphian, who has fallen in this wild and far-off 

 country. I refer to the death of Dr. William Gambel, former Secretary of xhe 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of your city, who left for California in the Spring 

 of 1849, taking the overland route, to collect specimens illustrating the nataral 

 history of the Far West, and to explore, to some extent, the promiaeut geological 

 features of the country between the Rocky Mountains and the Great Sierra 

 Nevada. He went from Independence to the upper crossing of the Kansas with 

 a small company of gentlemen from Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. After which 

 bis company joined Indiana Company, No. l,of which I had command, and with 

 us he continued until we reached Fort Kearney, on the Great Platte. There he 

 separated from us and joined a company commanded by Capt. Boon, of Kentucky, 

 which followed the trail opened by Capt. Hudspeth's company, crossing the 

 Sierra near the head of Sacramento valley. The trials of this rugged route across 

 fearful mountains and great deserts proved too much for the Doctor's constiraii on 

 and on reaching his destination in California, he was seized with typhoid fever of 

 which he died. He had collected during his journey a large number of rare and 

 interesting specimens, by which he had added largely to the rich store of know- 

 ledge he had previously gained. His loss is as sad as it is premature, and he 

 sleeps in peace beneath the towering pines which cluster .on a sunny hill-side 

 stretching up from the bright waters of the Rio del Plumos. Ke has departed 

 early, but not unhonored, and though the afflicting dispensation will fall heavily 

 on those to whom he was endeared by ties of relationship or friendship, yei iheir 

 consolation will be strongin the knowledge that he fell in the midst of his hon- 

 orable pursuit of knowledge, and the earnest and zealous unfolding of his nataral 

 and acquired gifts. Philadelphia owes to his memory a lasting tribute of respect 

 for his science, virtue, worth, talent, and energy. 



Very Respectfully yours, 



D. B. Woods. 



Mr. Vaux then offered on the part of Dr. Morton, the followino- re- 

 solutions, which were unanimously adopted, and the Recordinf Secre- 

 tary was directed to send a copy of the same to the family of the 

 deceased. 



Resolved^ That this Society has learned with deep regret, of the de- 

 cease of their esteemed associate, Dr. William Gambel, in Califorci-i on 

 the 13th December last. 



Resolved, That we cherish for Dr. Gambel the highest sentiments of 

 respect and regard, not only for his extensive and accurate attainments 

 in Botany and Ornithology, but also for the excellence of his heart, 

 his amiable manners, and his many virtues. 



Resolved, That we regard his untimely death in a distant land as a 

 painful bereavement to private friendship, and a misfortune to the kiter- 

 ests of science.

Mr. P. A. Browne expressed bis views in relation to the peculiarities 

 of the hair in man and other raauimalia, and more particularly on the 

 absence of a central canal in the hair of certain races of the former, 

 on which he proposes to found spcciGc differences. After some con- 

 versation among the memhers on the organization of hair, Mr. Browne 

 offered a resolution that a committee be appointed to make micro.-copic 

 investigations on the subject, which was adopted, and the following 

 committee appointed, viz : P. A. Browne, Prof. Haldeman, and Dr. 

 M 01 ton.

 in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Descriptions of neio species of Birds, specimens of which are in the colUciions of 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences of Piiiladelphia, 



By Jons Cassin. 



Vidua Vtrrcauzii, nohi3. Vieill. Ois. Chant, pi. 37 ? 



(^. Fortn. — Generally resembling Vidua paradisea, (Linn.) Swains. B. of W. 

 Af. I, pi. 11, but is larger, the two longest tail feathers taper gradually to the 

 end from near the middle of the feather, the outer (crupper) webs are very Bar- 




1850.] 57 



row, and they present bat a slight degree of convexity when compared with those 

 of V. paradisea. In the two specimens which I am now about to describe, the 

 bills and feet are decidedly larger and stronger. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to en*d of tail 15| inches. 

 Wing 3 1-10. Tail 12 inches. 



Colors, — Wide collar on posterior part of the neck (or nape) and the belly palo 

 fulvous. Breast rich glossy chestnut, thighs pale buff with some black feathers. 

 Upper part of the head, throat, under tail coverts, and all remaining parts of the 

 body black. Shorter tail feathers slightly edged with white at their tips. 



$ . Without long tail feathers, whole plumage cinereous, streaked with brown- 

 ish black, pale beneath. 



Hab. — Abyssinia. 



Obs. — Two males and one female of this species, now in the collection of ibis 

 Academy, have recently been received from M. Jules Yerreaux, of Paris, in a 

 note accompanying which, he expresses his conviction that they are distinct 

 from the common species, (V. paradisea.) Upon examination and comparison 

 with eighteen specimens of the latter, I entirely coincide with M. Verreaus, and 

 iave accordingly described it, hoping he will accept my specific name as a slight 

 tribute to his great accomplishments as a naturalist, and his enthusiastic attach- 

 ment to our favorite science. 



The species now described bears a strong general resemblance to the common 

 species, but may readily be distinguished by the different shape of the long tail 

 feathers. In the two males now before me the nuchal collar is pale, in which 

 respect they differ from the V. paradisea, and also from the plate gi7en by 

 Vieillot, which I have little doubt, however, is intended to represent the present 

 bird. For the purpose of comparing the general appearance of the two species, 

 the plates of Vieillot and Swainson above cited are sufficient for consultation. 



Hypliantornis badius, nobis. 



(^. Form. — Small for a typical species, wings medium, first quill very short, 

 almost spurious, fourth and fifth longest and nearly equal, tail rather short. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 5 inches, 

 wing 3, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. — Head above and mask including eyes and extending to the breast, 

 black, middle of the belly and tail coverts above and below bright yellow, all 

 other parts of the body bright reddish brown, (or burnt sienna brown.) Wing 

 feathers brownish black, externally with narrow edges of greenish yellow, and 

 ■with broad internal edges of pale yellow very conspicuous upon viewing the 

 Tving from below. Tail greenish yellow. 



Hab. — Fazogloa, Eastern Africa. 



Obs. — A small species related to H. rubiginosa, (Riipp.) and perhaps to H. 

 castaneofusca, (Less.) but appears to be quite distinct. Several specimens from 

 the Rivoli collection are now in the collection of the Academy, some of tbem are 

 labelled "P. mordoreus," which I have not succeeded in finding. 



This bird may possibly be the adult of one of the plain plumaged species de- 

 scribed by Dr. Smith or Mr. Ruppel. 



Atticora hamigera, nobis. 



Form. — Wings long, with the first primary longest and curved, several of the 




58 [JuNX, 



Ehoner primaries Blightly sinuated at their points oa the inaer weba, lips of 

 secondaries emarginate. External edge of the first primary (or edge of the wing) 

 furnished with a row of hooks or reversed bristles very obvious to the touch 

 and discernible witli the naked eye. Tail long and broad, deeply emarginate. 

 Legs slender. 



Uimensijjis — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 5J in. Wing 

 4 4-10. Tail 3} inches. 



Color. — Entire plumage fine black with a green gloss, inferior 6ur.''ace of the 

 wings and tail paler and without lustre. 



JIab. — Port Natal, Eastern Africa. 



Ohs. — Four specimens of this species are in the collection of the Academy, 

 several of which from the Rivoli collection were labelled " Hirundo velox, 

 Vieill.' It is not the bird. figured by Le Vaillant, which belongs to another 

 genus, and is not therefore the species intended by Vieillot. 



Cypselus Icucopygialis, nobis. 



Form. — Robust, wings long, exceeding the tail, primaries slightly curved with 

 the second longest. Tail rather short, truncate, scarcely emarginate. 



Dmejisions. — From tip of bill to end of tail 5J- inches. Wing 5J. Tail 2 

 inches. 



Colors. — Rump white, throat pale, nearly white ; back and upper surface of 

 the wings and tail brownish black with a green gloss, head and entire under 

 parts dull sooty brown. Inferior tail coverts with a slight subterminal black 

 band and minutely tipped with white. 



Hah. — Sumatra ? 



Ohs. — This species resembles the Cypselus afSnis, Gray, but is much larger. 

 It is quite distinct from that or any other species known to me. One specimen 

 only is in the museum of the Academy, which bears a label having .Sumatra as 

 the locality, and was received from Europe in a collection sent by Mr. Edward 

 Wilson. 



Acanthylis cinereocauda, nobis. 



Form. — Wings very long, with the second primary longest. Tail rather short 

 with the feathers broad and the terminal acute points conspicuous, upper tail 

 coverts long and ample. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 4 inches. 

 "Wings 4 8-10. Tail 1 3-10. 



Colors. — Rump, upper and under tail coverts and tail above and below pale 

 brownish cinereous, or mouse color ; shafts of the tail feathers black. All other 

 parts of the plumage brownish black, deeper and with a greenish lustre above, 

 dull and paler below. 



JIab. — South America. 



(}}j. — The species now described resembles Acanthylis spinicauda. (Temm.) 

 PI. Enl. 726, but may readily be distinguished by the entirely black plumage of 

 the under parts and by the pale color of the tail. Though not so large a bird 

 as the-.-!, spinicauda, its wings are longer. Two specimens are in the museum 

 of the Academy, one of which, sent from Paris by Mr. Edward Wilson, is marked 

 as doming from South America.

Hirundo scapularis, nobis. 



Form. — That of a typical Hirundo. Wings rather long, first primary longsst. 

 nearly all the primaries with oblique terminal indentations^ seeondaries 

 emarginate. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 5^- inches. 

 Wing 4 3-10. Tail 3 inches. 



Colors. — Scapulars and inferior wing coverts white. Entire plumage above, 

 including wings and tail, black, with a fine violet lustre, darkest upon the 

 head, beneath white with a yellowish tinge, shafts of inferior tail coverts black, 

 feathers on the back white at their bases, some feathers on the tfreast black 

 at their bases. - " 



J£ab. — Eastern Africa. 



Obs. — Appears to be allied to II. leucosoina, Swainson, but is larger, and 

 although the scapulars are conspicuously white, it has no spot on the wing. 

 One specimen only in the Rivoli collection. 



The committee on Mr. Moss' description of a new Carpolite from 

 Arkansas, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Description of a new Carpolite from Arkansas. 

 By Theodore F. Moss. 



Trigonocarpum Woodruffii. - — oi:l-. 



This very perfect specimen of a Carpolite was found in a fissure^Hed with 

 clay, in the clay state, ten miles north of Little Eock, Arkansas, and forty 

 miles east of the coal formation, where it is probably in place. It is now con- 

 verted into iron stone. 



The figure represents the fruit in its natural size, showing the pore for the 

 passage of the embryo at the base. The epicarp is three- 

 lobed, and therefore the fruit belongs to the Monocoty- 

 ledonous tribe of plants, and is about one-eighth of an inch 

 in thickness. 



The inner part or endocarp is striated from the circum- 

 ference of the pore (hilum), for the passage of the embryo. 



I have called the specimen Trigonocarpum Woodntffii, in 

 honor of William E. Woodruff, Esq., of Little Rock, a gen- 

 tleman who has done much to advance the knowledge of 

 the mineral wealth of Arkansas.

 which being intended for publication in the Journal, was referred to 

 Mr. Conrad, Dr. Wilson, and Dr. Morton. 



A paper was also read entitled, "Notice of fossil remains brought by 

 Mr, J. Evans from the 'Mauvais Terres,' or bad lands of White River, 

 150 miles west of the Missouri, by D. D. Owen, J. G, Norwood, and 

 John Evans," of which the following is an abstract : — 



This rcmark-.iblc collection consists of numerous teeth, fragments of bones, 

 and twenty skulls, some of which last are in an excellent state of preservation. 

 They belong to the orders K umhi an tia and Pac/iT/derJiiata. For the present, the 

 authors of the memoir propose to give only a general and provisional descrip- 

 tion, as the ba-is of a full report on a future occasion. The following species 

 are particularly noticed. ,. , i 



1. Palffiotherium? Proutii. These remarkable remains are thus named in 

 compliment to Dr. Prout, of St. Louis, who first noticed them in the American 

 Joutual of Science and Arts. The generic characters, however, are not yet 

 satisfactorily decided. 



2. Another species is allied to Cheer opolamus, and still more to IJi/racotherium, 

 but is probably distinct. The bones, skulls, and teeth of this animal were 

 found, with the greater part of the other remains, in a tlesh-colored calcareous 

 marl. 




1850.] 67 



Mr. Evaus' reports have traced the cretaceous formation, with its character- 

 istic fossils, from tlie mouth of the Iowa river to about SCO miles below the 

 Yellow Stone. In this region of country, and west 130 miles from Pierre 

 Chouteau, (on the Missouri four miles above Teton river,) Mr. Evans noticed 

 the following fossils: — Nucula Hammeri?, Ammonites Conradi, Morton, Inocer- 

 amus Crispii? Inoceramus planus, Inoceramus mytilloides ?, Inoceramus 

 Cuvieri, Nautilus Dekayi, Morton, Cucullcea vulgaris, Morton, Pholadomya 

 occidentalis, Morton, Gryphoea Pitcheri, Morion. 



Also — two species of Avicula, a Lucina, a Pyrula?, several undetermined 

 species of Ammonites and Baculites, two species of Scaphites, and a Diceras? 



On Sage creek, a southern tributary of the Chayenne, heading on the "bad 

 lands," Mr. Evans obtained tliree species of Inoceramus, two of Ammonites, 

 Nautilus Dekayi, Cucullcea vulgaris, &c. 



August 21th.

 Bucerus, and a jjroposi^ion to .re-7iame others of the genera Alcyone andijli- 

 rundo. :''^Un ]'•<•. rr^rrt'j. 



By John Cassin. 



1. Faradisea Vt'ilsonii, nobis. 



Form. — Specimen about to be described probably not fully adult, somewhat 

 mutilated, skin of the hinder part of the head wanting. Plumage compact, 

 with elongated feathers from the sides of the neck, and two plumes having 

 their origin at the base of the tail, which latter are curved into circles of about 

 one inch diameter. First primary spurious, third and fourth longest and 

 nearly equal. Exposed portion of the plumage of the back, thread-like ; 

 feathers on the belly broad and truncate. Subgenerically related to Paradisea 

 magnifica, Lath. 



Liiiiensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 7^ in., 

 wing 3|, tail IJ inches. 



Colors. — Back crimson, which color is completely enclosed by an edging of 

 black, and forms a somewhat cordate mantle. Large nuchal spot pale yellow. 

 Front and chin black. Wing coverts and quills hair brown, greater coverts 

 and primaries narrowly edged, secondaries and tertiaries broadly edged with 

 crimson, some of the more exposed tertiaries almost entirely of this color, 

 and tipped with black. Tail and coverts above and below hair brown. Orna- 

 mental plumes of the tail steel blue. Elongated feathers on the side of the 

 neck black, with a beautiful coppery lustre, and tipped with bright green. 

 Under parts from the neck to the abdomen silky green, the feathers brown at 

 their bases, and having iotermedial (between the brown and the green colors) 

 triangular spots of a deeper glossy green, inclining to blue upon the necfand 

 breast; truncate feathers of the sides and belly tipped with deep shining 

 green, posterior part of abdomen dull brownish black. 



Ilab. — New Guinea? 




68 [Aug. 



Ohs. — Tliis very banilsouic Paradise bird is one of the most valuable and 

 iateresting of the many contributions to the collection of this Academy, made 

 by Mr. Edward Wilson, of Lydstip house, rembrokeshire, to whom I have 

 taken the liberty of dedicating it, as a slight acknowledgment of Uis valu- 

 able services to the cause of the zoological sciences in this country. 



This species is a congener of Paradisea magnifica, Lath., but does not re- 

 semble that, nor any other known species to an extent sufficient to render 

 special designation necessary. All the species are in the collection of the 

 Academy. 



The specimen now described was obtained by Mr. Wilson in England, but 

 bears no label indicating locality. It is probably not fully adult. 



Paxlor nigrocinctua, nobis. 



Form. — Specimen now about to be described much mutilated, cranium de- 

 stroyed and skin of the head much injured, nearly the whole of the wing 

 feathers and legs wanting. Feathers of the hind head somewhat elongated, 

 exposed portion of the plumage of the rump and tail coverts filiform, tail 

 feathers broad, rather abruptly terminated and slightly acuminated. Aber- 

 rant, possibly a Gracula. 



JJimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 8 

 inches, tail 3 inches. 



Colors. — Head (entirely?), broad band completely encircling tbe middle of 

 the body ; (wings?) and tail black with a greenish metallic lustre. 



Broad band encircling the anterior third portion of the body, including 

 breast and neck above and below, and another broad band encircling tbe pos- 

 terior third portion of the body including abdomen, rump, and tail coverts, 

 sati'ron yellow, paler on the under tail coverts. Bill yellow. 



Hub. — New Guinea. 



Obs. — I have seen two specimens only of this bird, one of which is in 

 a museum at Albany ; the other is the property of the Academy, and is the 

 specimen now before me. Both were imported by Mr. J. G. Bell, of New 

 York, deservedly well known as a naturalist and taxidermist, by whom the 

 species was first pointed out to me as probably undescribed, and who has also 

 had the kindness to inform me that he received them with skins of Paradise 

 birds. They are mutilated in the same manner as those usually are, and have 

 been subjected to similar methods of preservation ; from which facts I have 

 inferred that they may be from New Guinea. 



3. Buceros Fistulator, nobis. 



Form. — Very similar to that of Buceros Buccinator, Temm., but is muck 

 smaller. Specimen now described probably not fully adult, bill nearly simple. 



Comparative Dimensions. 



B. Buccinator. B. Fistulator. 



Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 2-3 inches, 17 inches. 



Wing, 12 " 9.} " 



Tail, 10^ " 7^ " 



Colors. — Very similar to those of Buceros Buccinator, Temm. Lower 

 •medial part of breast, abdomen, thighs, under tail coverts, inferior wing 

 coverts, tips of secandary and tertiary quills, and tips of external tail feathers, 

 ■white, all other parts black with a greenish lustre. 

 Ilah. — Western Africa. 




1850.] 69 



Ohs. — Two specimens of the bird now describeil a^-e in the collection, one 

 of which presented by Mr. Edward Verreaux, of Paris, has the plumngc of 

 an adult bird, though its bill is without appendages. In all other lespects 

 both specimens are very similar to B. Buccinator, Teram., PI. Col. '270, bat 

 are so much smaller that 1 cannot think it possible they are young birds of 

 that species. 



4. Alcyone Lessonii, nobis. 

 "Ceyx azurea, Less." 



" Alcedo azurea, Lath." Lesson, Voy. Coquille, I, p. 690. 



Form. — Much resembling that of Alcyone azurea, (Lath.) Gould B. of Aust. 

 II, pi. 25, but is larger ; the hill is much thicker and wider. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 6f 

 inches, wing Z\, tail 1^ inches. 



Colors. — Generally resembling those of A. azurea, but upon the upper sur- 

 face of the body are of a deeper and more uniform blue. Entire plumage 

 above deep azure blue, which color extends somewhat upon the sides of the 

 breast. Quills and tail beneath brownish black, the former narrowly edged 

 exteriorly with blue. Small narine spots and another large spot en each side 

 of the neck, yellowish white. Throat nearly white, all the other under parts 

 of the body deep fawn yellow, inclining to reddish ou the sides. 



Ilah. — Havre de Dorey, New Guinea. 



06sr — This species is described by Mons. Lesson, as above, but is quite 

 different from the A. azurea or either of the other nearly allied Australian 

 species, being decidedly larger and in all respects more robustly organized. 

 It is not figured in Voy. Coquille, though a complete description is given. 



One specimen only is in the collection of the Academy, which is another of 

 the valuable acquisitions made in Paris by Mr. Edward Wilson. 



5. Hirundo Gouldii, nobis. 



Hirundo frontalis, Gould. Proc. Zool. Soc London 1837, p. 22, and Voy. 

 Beagle, Birds, p. 40, (1841.) 



0/js. — I propose to apply this name, Hirundo Gouldii, to the species des- 

 cribed by Mr. Gould as above in 1837 ; the name given by him, Hirundo 

 frontalis, having been previously applied to another species by Quoy and 

 Gaimard, Voy. Astrolabe, Zoologie I, p. 204, (1830.) 



Several specimens of both species are in the collection of the Academy. 



The Committee to which was referred a paper by Drs. D. D. Owen, 

 and B. F. Shumard, describing new species of Crinoidea from the 

 sub-carboniferous limestone of Iowa, &c., reported in favor of publi- 

 cation in the Journal. 



A letter was read from Dr. J. H. Troschel. Professor of Zoology in 

 the University of Bonn, and present editor of the Archiv. fiir Natur- 

 geschichte, announcing the transmission to the Academy of retient 

 numbers of that work, and expressing his desire to exchange for the 

 publications of the Academy, and requesting permission to make trans-

September Sd, 1850. 

 Dr. MoRTOX, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 

 dated Washington, August 10th, 1850, acknowledging the reception of 

 Yol. 1st, new series, of the Journal, by that Institution. 



A letter was read from Dr. D. D. Owen, addressed to President Morton, 

 dated July 18, 1850, stating the fact as worthy of record, that the cane 

 (Miegia arundinacea) had this year borne flowers and produced seed in 

 Indiana, a rare occurrence with this plant. Mr. Nuttall, in his " Genera 

 of N. A. Plants," in reference to " M. gigantea ?" perhaps a variety of 

 " macrosperma," says, " this species is supposed to flower but once in 20 

 or 25 years." 



Mr. Clay observed that this occurrence was not confined to Indiana 

 this year, but was very extensive in the Western States. Similar facts

Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Dr. Morton offered some remarks on the value of the word species in 

 Zoology. 



On this point there is great diversity of opinion among naturalists. Some 

 deny the law of specific distinctions — at least, their arguments lead to this infer- 

 ence. Thus, Lamarck and Geoffroy St. Hilaire insist upon the uninterrupted 

 succession of the animal kingdom — the gradual mergence of one species into 

 another, from the earliest ages of time ; and they suppose that the fossil animals 

 whose remains are preserved in the various geological strata, however different 

 from those of our own time, may nevertheless have been the ancestors of those 

 now in being. Sir Charles Lyell has opposed this theory with great ingenuity 

 and general success ; yet whoever will examine the tacts and arguments 

 employed by its authors, may be disposed to admit that it is not altogether 

 devoid of foundation in some exceptions to the general law of Nature.

82 [Sept. 



Somewhat allied to this is the opinion of Swainson and others, that perma- 

 nent varieties constitute species, or in other words, that variations of climate, 

 food and treatment produce specific distinctions. 



Species is defined by Buffon, "a succession of similar individuals which re- 

 produce each other." Cuvier's definition is nearly the same ; but he adds that 

 '<tlie apparent differences of the races of our domestic species are stronger 

 than those of any species of the same genus. The fact of the succc^sio/i, 

 therefore, and of the constant succession, constitutes alone the validity of the 

 species." 



An objection to these definitions arises from the fact that they apply as 

 -readily to mere varieties as to acknowledged species. Certain albino animals 

 re-produce, »ii(?r 4c, to an indefinite extent; such also is the case with some 

 fanciful varieties of the dog, pigeon, &c., which are capable of multiplying by 

 the law of succession, and yet have no claim to specific distinction, in the re- 

 stricted acceptation of that term. 



I have brought together these definitions, in the first place to show that 

 naturalists are by no means agreed upon what constitutes a species, and sec- 

 ondl}", to offer some views of my own. 



As the result of much observation and reflection, I now submit a definition 

 which I hope will obviate at least some of the objections to which I have 

 alluded. Species — a prhnordial organic form. It will be justly remarked that a 

 difficulty presents itself, at the outset, in determining what forms are primordial; 

 but independently of various other sources of evidence, we may be assisted in 

 the inquiry by those monumental records, both of Egypt and Assyria, of which 

 we are now happily possessed of the proximate dates. My view may be briefly 

 explained by saying, that if certain existing organic types can be traced back 

 into the " night of time," as dissimilar as we see them now, is it not more 

 reasonable to regard them as aboriginal, than to suppose them the mere acci- 

 dental derivations of an isolated patriarchal stem of which we know nothing ? 

 Hence, for example, I believe the dog family not to have originated from one 

 primitive form, but from many. Again, what I call a species may be regarded 

 by some naturalists as & primitive variety; but, as the difference is only in name, 

 and in no way influences the zoological question, it is unnecessary to notice it 

 further. 



These views appear to correspond with those of Mr. Linnaeus Martin, who 

 expresses himself in the following terms : 



" We are among those who believe that, as there are degrees in the relation- 

 ship of species to species, some may, although distinct, approximate so nearly 

 as not only to produce inter se, males incapable of interbreeding, but a progeny 

 of fertile hybrids, capable of admixture, even to the most unlimiled extent. 



Species may therefore be classed according to their disparity or affinity, in 

 the following provisional manner : 



Remote species of the same genus, are those among which hybrids are never 

 produced. 



Allied species produce inter se, an infertile offspring. 

 Proximate species produce with each other a fertile offspring.

After some preliminary business, the Society proceeded to an elec- 

 tion for Vice President, in place of Dr. Griffith, deceased, when Dr. 

 Robert Bridges was elected to that office. 



The Society also elected Dr. T. B. Wilson a member of the Con-

 sioned by the decease of Dr. Griffith. 



ELECTION. 



Aubrey H. Smith, Esq., of Philadelphia, was elected a Member ot 

 the Academy. 



October \st. 



Da. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Dr. Bridges presented a paper entitled " Descriptions of four new 

 species of Crinoidea, from the sub-carboniferous limestone of Iowa and 

 Illinois, collected during the U. S. Geological Survey of Iowa, &c., in 

 the years 1848-9. By David Dale Owen, M. D., and B. F. Shumard, 

 M. D.;" being an addition to the memoir by the same authors read at a 

 late meeting of the Academy. The present paper was referred to the 

 committee having charge of the previous portion, viz., Messrs. Conrad, 

 Wilson and Morton. 



A letter was read from the Secretary of the Lyceum of Natural 

 History, of New York, dated September 27th, 1850, stating, that a 

 parcel containing publications of several scientific societies of Lyons, 

 France, had been received by M. Grex, of New York, for the Academy. 



Dr. Bridges read a letter from Mr. George Ord, accompanying the 

 donation of copper plates XX and XXI, of Vol. 4, 1st series, 8vo. of 

 the Journal of this Institution. On motion, the thanks of the Society 

 were unanimously voted to Mr. Ord for his liberal and valuable gift. 



Dr. Leidy, read a description of a new species of Ligula (L. sala- 

 mandras) which on motion was referred to a committee consisting of 

 Drs. Hallowell, Keller, and Zantzinger. 



Dr. Morton, read the following extract from a letter from A. C. 

 Harris, Esq., addressed to Mr. George R. Gliddon, and dated Alexan- 

 dria, in Egypt, 6th Aug., 1850, in relation to the present existence of 

 the Ibis religiosa , in that country. 



" Upon a large sand-bank opposite to the Casr-el Sayad, I positively saw an 

 Jbis on the 20th of last December. I have seen stuffed specimens brougjit from 

 Sennaar, and cannot be mistaken in the bird. Its shape is that of the Monuments 

 — the body is grey, the head and part of the neck black, as also the feathers of 




81 [Oct. 



the tail. It was with a flock of other birds, and as it slowly left the bank of the 

 river, I remarked that there was a peculiarity in in gait. It pondered over the 

 ground as it walked with eccentric pace, as if it were measuring angles ; and it 

 struck me that it was this trait to which Plutarch alludes, and which gave to the 

 Ibis the character of Ilierogrammaticus or Geometer. If any one else has had the 

 good fortune to see this bird in its natural state, he will perhaps have noticed 

 the singularity which I have described." 



In confirmation of Mr. Harris's remark about the scarcity of the real 

 Ibis rdigiusa at the present day in Egypt, ]Mr. Gliddon observed, that 

 although he had shot over the length and breadth of the land at all 

 times of the year, he had never seen a Uviwj Ibis during twenty three 

 years residence there. The only modern specimen of the Ills he had 

 ever seen was a dead one, offered for sale by a ]Moghrebbee hunter at 

 Cairo, about 1835. Mr. Harris has been familiar with Egypt for 

 twenty-seven years, and besides being a profound hierologist, is a keen 

 and observing sportsman. His experience is therefore authoritative ; 

 and a suflScient refutation of the accounts of tourists, who talk of seeing 

 Ibist^ on the Nile as if they were common birds there — confounding 

 this with that commonest of all birds, the buffalo crane, called by the 

 Arabs Aboo-f/crdan. 



The blacJ: Ibis, though very rare has been shot by Mr. Gliddon near 

 lake Bourlos in the Delta. Both species are still abundant above 

 Dongola. 



Dr. Mortoti called attention to two plates, which he exhibited, of 

 Layard's folio illustrations. of the ruins of Nineveh, whereon are figured 

 the Camel ( C. bactrianus,) and Dromedary (C. dromedarius,) with as 

 much distinctive accuracy as if they had been drawn but yesterday, 

 and yet they date, according to Mr. Layard, 2600 years before our era, 

 or, according to Rawlinson, more than a thousand years later. In either 

 case, they are additional evidences of the distinctness of species, a point 

 which has been disputed, simply because they are said to produce with 

 each other a fertile hybrid offspring. 



The following resolution was adopted : Resolved^ That a copy of the 

 Proceedings, as far as published, be presented to the Agricultural 

 Society of Lyons.

 Journal, and of recent Nos. of the Proceedings. 



Also a letter from Col. J. D. Graham, dated Washington, September

 the Academy, which had been lost. On motion, the request was 

 granted.

Dr. Leidy read a paper describing several species of Eatozoa, which 

 was referred to a committee on a previous paper by the same author, 

 viz., Drs. Hallowell, Keller and Zantzinger. 



Dr. Leidy also read a paper entitled " Notes on the development of 

 the Gordius aquaticus," which was likewise referred to the preceding 

 committee. 



Dr. Morton made the following observations on the Antiquity of 

 some races of Dogs : --^^i-- : 



In tracing back the age of certain canine breeds and species, I chiefly avail 

 myself of the chronology of Prof. Lepsius, which has happily revealed the 

 pi-oximate dates of the Egyptian monuments, and thus enabled us to refer 

 both man and animals to their respective epochs of time. 



The following facts are offered as the initiatory portion of an extended series 

 which it is my intention from time to time to bring forward. 



1. The Fox-Dog — (C. lupaster.) — This animal is of the middle size, with 

 erect ears and somewhat bushy tail. It appears to be the oldest dog of which 

 the Egyptians have left an effigy ; for it represents a symbol in their alpha- 

 bet,* with which it must be coeval, and therefore demonstrably not much less 

 than six thousand years old. This same? dog is again represented on the 

 paintings in the tomb of Roti, at Beni Hassan, which date with the Xllth 

 dynasty, or the 23d century B. C. ; and he can thence be traced downwards, 

 through the successive monumental periods, until these cease to record the 

 affairs of Egypt. It is also found embalmed in great numbers in various parts 

 of that country ; and lastly, it appears to have been ' ' the parent stock of the 

 modern red wild-dog so common at Cairo and the other towns of the lower 

 country." f Clot-Bey observes that it now leads a nomadic life, and generally 

 without a master, and like the jackal and the fox, frequents the confines of the 

 desert. It does not usually associate with other dogs, but is capable of re-pro- 

 ducing with them ; but this cross-breed is of no use or value. Ehrenberg, 

 who calls this animal Canis lupaster, supposes it to have been primitively a 

 wolf ; but as in its pi-esent wild state it nowhere becomes a true wolf, we may 

 more safely refer its origin to some feral stock, once and perhaps yet indigen- 

 ous to the region of the Nile. 



2. The Grethopjtd. — (C. graius.) — There are three varieties of this animal 

 represented on the monuments of Egypt ; but the oldest has long, erect ears, 

 with a smooth, short (and,'probably cropped) tail. I first detect it in the paint- 

 ings in a tomb of the Hid dynasty, (where it occurs in several different places, ) 

 and is consequently upwards of five thousand years old ; thence, I have traced 

 it down through the Vlth and Xllth dynasties, where my researches stop for 

 the present for want of the requisite leisure. But this same dog may possi- 

 bly be represented by the Roumelian greyhound of the present day, which, 

 however, I know only from description. 



3. Another greyhound first appears in the tomb of Roti, at Beni Hassan, in 

 the 23d century before Christ. X It has all the characters of the pendant- 

 eared greyhound of the present day, as figured by Buffon, but is represented 



*Bun3en, Egypt's place in Universal History, p. 417. 



t "Wilkinson, Manners and Customs of the Ancient Esyptians, III, p. 38. 



X Rosellini, Mon. Tav. XVII, fig. 3. 




86- [Oct. 



with cropped ears. Now the present Nubian greyhound, as seen in the beau- 

 tiful plates of M. Prisso's Oriental Album, appears to be the very same nnimal ; 

 and it is a curious fact, mentioned to me by Mr. Gliddou, that the Modern 

 Nubians habitually crop the ears of tliis doj^. 



4. The third form of antique greyhound has a Inishy tail. It is figured by 

 Hamilton Smitli from tho monuments, but I have not yet met with it. and 

 consequently cannot at present determine its age. A similar form, calh'd the 

 Akaha gro/hound, is yet common in Syria and Aral>ia.* 



But what is not less remarkable than the permanence and vast antiquity of 

 the preceding forms, is the fact that what we call the English greyhound is fig- 

 ured with every distinctive characteristic, even to the semi-pendant ears, on a 

 supposed antique statue now preserved in the Vatican at Rome, t 



The first three of this series are probably primordial forms ; but the English 

 greyhound may be a derivative from some partial intermixture, in the same 

 manner that the Irish greyhound is said to be derived from an infusion of the 

 great Danish dog with the common breed. % 



f). The Bloodhound — (C. S'ajra.r. )— Several varieties of the stag and blood- 

 hound are very closely allied. In the tomb of Roti, at Beni Hassan, is a paint- 

 ing representing a spirited deer-h»nt, and the dogs, two of which are repre- 

 sented, are admirable illustrations of this variety. They are common on the 

 latter monuments : for example, in the Grand Procession of Thotmes III, (B. C. 

 1700,) where several of them are associated with people and productions of 

 the interior of Africa. § Again, yet later, it is seen in a tomb at Gourneh, near 

 Thebes ; and if I mistake not, through various later epochs. Now if we com- 

 pare the oldest of the delineations — viz. : those of Beni Hassan, with the 

 bloodliounds of Africa lately (and perhaps yet) living in the Tower Menagerie. 

 in London, we cannot deny their identity, so complete is the resemblance of 

 form and instinct. || 



6. The Turnspit — (C. vertagus.) — Wilkinson and Blainville have both ac- 

 knowledged that a variety of this dog is figured in the tomb of Roti, at Beni 

 Hassan. ^ It is yet common both in Europe and Asia. 



7. The Watch Dog — (C. .) — Several of these animals, or at least 



their analogues, are figured in the tomb just mentioned. ** They bear a 

 striking resemblance to one figured on a Roman mosaic pavement at Pompeii, 

 and are frequently met with in the East. It is possibly this dog which repre- 

 sents a second canine symbol in the hieroglyphic alphabet ; but the figure is 

 too small to enable me to speak with confidence, ft 



8. House Dog— ( C. hybridus.') — I take this identification and provisional spe- 

 cific name, as I have also most of the others of this series, from Blainville. J J

1850.] 87 



We find this animal also on the monuments of the Xllth dynasty, where it 

 presents some modifications much as we see them in the present day.* 



9. The Wolf-Dog. ( C. pomeranus.) — This animal is also well represented at 

 Beui Hassan, with all the characteristics that can be embraced in a drawing 

 that is little more than an outline. f It is also figured on an ancient Etruscan ? 

 medal of the second or third century B. C.J 



It will be observed that two of the preceding varieties of dog are coeval with 

 the earliest hieroglyphic symbols ; and as these l^st cannot be later than the 

 age of Menes, the first king of Egypt, we may safely date them on the chron- 

 ology of Lepsius, as far back as that epoch, viz. 3893 B. C, or 5743 years from 

 our own time ; but how much further, we have not, at present, even the means 

 of forming a reasonable conjecture. 



Oue other form — the long-eared greyhound — dates, as we have seen, with the 

 3d dynasty — about 3500 years B. C. Six additional forms dates with the 12th 

 dynasty, which ended B. C. 2124 ; and as the tombs of Roti and Nevopth belong 

 to the reign of Osortasen II., they are placed by Lepsius iu the twenty-third 

 century before Christ. 



I give these pictorial data as a part only of the series ; for of the eight hun- 

 dred plates announced by Dr. Lepsius as in progress of publication, but thirty- 

 five have yet reached this country ; and for these I am indebted to the kind- 

 ness of that distinguished scholar who has at length raised the " Veil of Isis,'' 

 and given dates to the hitherto chaotic Monuments of the Nile. 



The Rev. Dr. Bachman quotes Hamilton Smith to show that three thousand 

 years ago, two varieties only of the dog were known. This was excusable in 

 a naturalist who at the time of publishing his Canidce, (1839,) eould not have 

 seen the complete iconography of either Champollion or Rosellini ; and again, 

 at that period the earliest sculptures and paintings were unknown, nor had 

 the series been chronologically arranged-a consummation that gives them nearly 

 their whole value in a zoological sense. The Hebrew chronology ascribes the 

 Deluge to the year 2340 B. C. Now three of these dogs date nearly a thou- 

 sand years earlier in time, and all the rest belong to the twenty- third century 

 before our era. Col. Smith's views were in accordance with the knowledge 

 of the coexistent time ; but any one who had taken the pains even to look 

 over Rosellin's plates, might have obtained additional information oa this 

 question. 



10. The Bull-Dog — (C. molossus.) — -This animal is admirably figured on a 

 piece of antique Creek sculpture in the Vatican. The form aud expression of 

 the head are perfectly characteristic, even to the peculiar arrangement of the 

 teeth. § It is remarked by Holland in his Travels in Greece, that the Bull-dog 

 is yet the dominant variety of Albania, where it has been trained to guard the 

 flocks, and thus to take the place of the Shepherd's dog. 



11. Mastiff.(C. laniarius.) — I have not yet detected this dog on the Nilotic 

 monuments ; but it is mentioned by Aristotle and seen on two ancient Greek 

 medals, one of which, that of Segestus of Sicily, dates with 4th or 5th century 

 B. C. — The other, which is of Aquila Severa, Dictator of Crete, is abo<lt two 

 centuries later. ||

 §Blainville, Osteographie, Canis, p. 74. Ibidem. 




88 [Oct. 



12. Suei'herd's Dog — (C. dotneHticu.^.) — The earliest effigy of this animal, 

 which is mentioned by Aristotle, is preserved on anoicnt Etruscan medals of 

 unknown date. The probability is that it was familiar to man in the earliest 

 ages, and may yet be found on the Egyptian monuments. It is doubtless one 

 of the primordial forms of the canine race. 



In allusion to the illustrations derived from the monuments, Blainville truly 

 remarks that " we here see a large number of our existing breeds of do^'s ;" 

 and inasmuch as they have preserved their identity through such vast periods 

 of time, not only in tlie most diversified climates, but alto under the influence 

 of the greatest variety of circumstances, is it not reasonable to believe that a 

 part at least of these forms, constitute essential primeval types ? We trace them 

 back into the "night of time," and find them as distinct as they yet are in the 

 living Fauna ; and it remains for those persons wh.o insist that they all have 

 been derived from an aboriginal pair, to give us something more in proof than 

 analogical reasoning, or inferences drawn from arbitrary views of the laws 

 of Nature. 



But an evidence of the great antiquity of the animal we call the domestic dog, 

 ;ind one to which I have already alluded, is the fact that it has been recently 

 found in a fossil state in two localities very remote from each other. First, in 

 Germany by Schmerling, and secondly, in New Zealand by Mr. W. Mantell, 

 (son of the celebrated geologist,) who there found it associated with the bones 

 of the gigantic Dinornis. Now from these facts I conceive we must conclude, 

 either that some forms of this animal are primordial and independent of human 

 domestications ; or, that maii himself, having existed contemporaneously with 

 these now fossilized animals, claims a vast antiquity as a denizen of the earth. 



It is shrewdly observed by Azara, that if the dilfereuces among dogs were the 

 result of climate, all the dogs of each separate country should be alike. To 

 this I may add, that if they are all descended from a single primal type, they 

 ought, on resuming the wild state, to return to this type. Yet in America, 

 where the experiment has been observed on the largest and most unequivocal 

 scale, we see no such result. In Jamaica, they have in some instances reverted 

 to the shepherd's dog — in others, to the great Danish dog ; and this last variety 

 is the dominant one in the wild packs of Paraguay. In Cuba they have some- 

 times resembled greyhounds, and in the pampas of Brazil they are more like 

 terriers. In other words, they constantly tend to recur to that primitive element 

 which is most dominant in their physical constitution ; and it is remarkable that in 

 the old world this restored type is never the wolf, although it is sometimes, as 

 we have seen, a lupine dog, owing to the physiological cause just mentioned. 

 The blending of the opposite extremes of these types, and these hybrids again 

 with each other, gives rise, as every one knows, to these degenerate animals 

 known as pugs, shocks, spaniels, &c., which Cuvier justly calls ''the most 

 degenerate productions," and which are found " to possess a short and fleeting 

 existence— the common lot of all tj'pes of modern origin." 



Among the North American Indians, the original forms are very few and 

 closely allied ; whence it happens that these grotesque varieties never appear. 

 Neither have they any approximation to that marked family we call hounds; and 

 this fact is the more remarkable since the Indian dogs are employed in the same 

 manner of hunting as the hounds of Europe, Asia and Africa. Yet, this similarity 

 of employment has causednoanalogy of exterior form. No varieties like those 

 so familiar in Europe, spring up among them. They are as homogeneous as the 




1850.] 89 



wolf races from whom they have descended ; and Dr. Richardsoa quotes Theodat 

 to show that the common Indian dog has not materially changed during two hun- 

 dred and twenty years. Again, the same remark applies to the indigenous Alco 

 and Teehichi dogs of Mexico and South America, which, before their admixture 

 with European breeds, conformed to the types or species from whence they 

 sprung, without branching into the thirty varieties of Bufifon, or the sixty of 

 Brown. The dog of New-Caledonia, in the western regions of Arctic America, 

 cannot be regarded as an exception, for he is also a lupine animal, although too 

 little is known of him to enable us to suggest his relative position to the other 

 American races. The Indian dog of Florida partakes largely also of the wolf, 

 and is supposed by Hamilton Smith to be intermediate between the common 

 grey wolf (C. occidentaUs) and the Newfoundland dog, C. palmatus. And Snally, 

 the latter animal, which belongs also to the same great dog family, is by some 

 naturalists regarded as a cross between the Esquimaux dog and some exotic 

 breed. To this latter question I have not yet given attention. 



What is true of forms is equally true of instincts. 



" It is undoubtedly true (observes vSir. C. Lyell) that many new habits and 

 qualities have not only been acquired, in recent times, by certain races of dogs, 

 but have been transmitted to their offspring. But in these cases it will be ob- 

 served that the new peculiarities have an intimate relation to the habits of the 

 animal in a wild state, and therefore do not attest any tendency to departure, to 

 an indefinite extent, from the original type of the species." 



The author then instances a peculiar mode in which a certain breed of dogs 

 attack the deer on the platform of Santa Fe, in Mexico, and adds, that other Euro- 

 pean hunting dogs, though of superior strength and general sagacity, are desti- 

 tute of tRis instinct, and are often, in consequence, killed by the deer. 



I explain this phenomenon, not on the supposition of a new, but of a latent in- 

 stinct, which circumstances have merely developed ; and as by crossing dissimi- 

 lar .species or varieties of dogs, we obtain the blended and opposite lineaments 

 of both, so, by the same process, we may combine a double or modified instinct. 



In view of the preceding facts, I continue to regard the great canine race of 

 the old and new world as constituted of many species of primordial dogs ; of 

 three, at least, (and perhaps more) species of wolves; of some accessions from 

 the fox-tribe, and a less certain infusion of the jackal. The wolves that appear 

 to have principally contributed to this protean family, are the Canis lupus of the 

 old world, and the C. occidenUdis, or common grey-wolf, and the C. lutrans or 

 prairie-wolf of America. The evidence of the fox-tribe are most conspicuously 

 shown in the Aguara dogs of more southern latitudes.

A letter was also read from J. A. Grex, Esq., addressed to the Libra- 

 rian, dated New York, October o, LS50, transmitting the above works, 

 and acknowledging the reception of a copy of the Journal, Vol. 1, new 

 series, and of a copy of the Proceedings, for the Agricultural Society of 

 Lyons. 



Dr. Leidy presented two papers, one describing two new species of 

 Infusorial Entozoa, and the other entitled '< Descriptions of some nema- 

 toid Entozoa infesting insects," both of which were referred to the 

 committee having charge of previous communications by Dr. Leidy, 

 read at the late meetings of the Society, viz., Drs. Hallowell, Keller, and 

 Zantzinger. 



Dr. Leidy also made the following observations on two new genera 

 of mammalian fossils, which he designates under the name of Eucro- 

 taphus Jacksoni, and Archaeotherium Mortoni : 



The two fragments of mammalian crania, which I exhibit this evening to the 

 Academy, are part of those specimens a short time since presented to our Cabinet 

 by Mr. Joseph Culbertson, of Cumberland Co., Penna., whose son obtained 

 them from that region of country, in the vicinity of Fort Laramie on the Platte 

 river, known as the " mauvais ,terres," or "bad lands," a ^locality, which, 

 according to recent researches made by Dr. John Evans, is rich in such 

 remains. Both fragments belong to new genera of mammalia. The smaller 

 of these I have named Eucrotaphus, on account of the comparatively very large 

 size of the temporal bones. It consists of the central portion only of the cranium, 

 and is a little longer than the corresponding portion of the skull of the beaver 

 (Castor fiber.) In general outline it resembles the posterior part of the cranium 

 of the American mink, (Mustela lutreola) or more particularly that of the opos- 

 sum, (Didelphis virginiana ;) being broad posteriorly, cylindroid anterior to the 

 ossa tempera, but is not as bulging at the sides as in the latter mentioned 

 animals. 



The bones still existing in the specimen consist of the right temporal, except 

 its zygoma and posterior superior portion ; a portion of the left squamous bone; 

 the middle portion of the ossa parietalia, ossified into one, except the sagittal 

 crest; the right para-mastoid, or paroccipital process, except the tip, with a 

 small fragment of the occiput above it ; the posterior sphenoid, somewhat 

 mutilated ; a fragment of the presphenoid; and a fragment of the basioccipital. 



The most remarkable characteristics of this head are : — first, the comparatively 

 enormous size of the squamous portion of the ossa tempora; second, the great 

 advancement of the ossa parietalia ;* third, the deep groove in the ossa parietalia 

 just in advance of the squamous suture; fourth, the strength of origin of the 

 zygoma: and fifth, the form of the glenoid cavity. 



* I for some time hesitated before I applied this name to the symmetrical bone 

 occupying the upper part of the cranium. I thought at first it was the frontal 

 extending very far back, but upon considering the advanced position of the squa- 

 mous portion of the temporal bone, and observing in the Erinaceus ecaudatus, 

 a considerable prolongation forward of the ossa parietalia, I concluded that it 

 belonged to the latter category. 




1850.] 91 



It has been frequently remarked in works on anatomy, that in man, ihe squa- 

 mous portion of the temporal bone enters into the construction of the cavity of 

 the cranium comparatively more than in any other animal, but in the fossil before 

 us we find it to be comparatively much greater than in man, for although the 

 cranium is but little larger than that of the beaver, yet the squamous portion of 

 the temporal bone in it measures over two inches in breadth antero-posteriorly, 

 and one and three-fourths of an inch at its highest point. The summits of this 

 portion of the two bones are not more than seven-ttnths of an inch apart at the 

 top of the bead. The exterior surface of the squamous bone is very slightly con- 

 vex, nearly flat, and inclines at an angle of about 50°. It is bounded postero- 

 inferiorly by a strong, projecting ridge, the superior root of the zygoma, which 

 commences almost vertically above and a very little behind the meatus audito- 

 rius externus. The origin or commencementof this ridge indicates considerable 

 advancement of the squamous bone. Just within the ridge posteriorly, on a line 

 with the meatus auditorius externus, is a large round venous foramen, the di- 

 rection of which is downwards and inwards. 



The base of the zygoma is remarkably strong, its direction being at first almost 

 directly outward. The glenoid cavity is of unusually large extent, even greater 

 than that of most known Ruminantia, and is placed immediately beneath the 

 base of support of the zygoma, more like in man and the quadrumana than in other 

 animals. In its direction it is transverse, with an inclination from within outward 

 and a little upward. Posteriorly it is bounded by a comparatively enormous 

 tuberosity separating it from the meatus auditorius externus, which at its longest 

 part internally measures 7-lOths of an inch from the floor of the meatus, 

 J an inch in thickness at the base, antero-posteriorly, on a level with the 

 bottom of the glenoid cavity, and over 6-lOths of an inch transversely. Anteriorly 

 the glenoid cavity is bounded by a broad transverse ridge, about two lines higher, 

 anterior to which is a large inferior concave surface extending inward and for- 

 ward to the root of the pterygoid processes and the speno-orbitar foramen, 

 bounded on the exterior of the latter by a projecting ridge of the alisphenoid. 

 Posterior to the posterior glenoid tuberosity, and the superior root of the zygoma , 

 is a nearly vertical triangular excavation, bounded posteriorly by the mastoid 

 and para-mastoid processes, and containing the meatus auditorius externus 

 bounded below by a strong, semicircular auditory process. In a groove between 

 the latter and the post-glenoid tuberosity, is placed a second small tuberosity or 

 ridge about 1 line in length. 'Continuous with the groove just mentioned around 

 the base of the posterior glenoid tuberosity internally, is a deep fissure, having 

 at its bottom two glenoidal foramina. Bounding the fissure on the inside, is a 

 lai'ge, compressed globular auditory bulla, measuring about T-lOths of an inch 

 vertically, and antero-posteriorly, and 6-lOths of an inch transversely. Posteri- 

 iorly it abuts against the para-mastoid, process, and antero-externally it joins 

 the alisphenoid by a prominent ridge just within the suture, separating the ali- 

 sphenoid from the squamous bone. Postero-externally, bounded posteriorly by 

 the para-mastoid, and externally by the auditory process, is a deep vertical pit 

 at the bottom of which is a round basis of support for the styloid proces^of the 

 temporal bone. Antero-internally to the auditory bulla, between it and the 

 basisphenoid and alisphenoid, is a large oval pit, the foramen lacerum anterius, 

 and the caroticum combined. Anterior to this, placed in the alisphenoid between 




92 [Oct. 



the aiulitory bulla and the root of the pterygoid processes is the foramen ovale. 

 The latter mentioned basis of support to the pterygoid processes is a triangular 

 prominence, and placed immediately on a line with it in front is a large round 

 spheuo-orbitar foramen. The basisphenoid is cylindrical in form, a little over 

 an inch in length, and joins the presphenoid on a line with the spheno-orbitar 

 foramina. TJie mutilated commencement of the presphenoid in the specimen is 

 alone sufficient to indicate that it undergoes little diminution in diameter from 

 that of the basisphenoid. The basioccipital is also cylindroid in form, a little 

 broader than the basisphenoid and articulates with the latter on a line with it. 

 The para-mastoid process or paroccipital joins the mastoid process, andaflfords 

 an abutment posteriorly to the auditory bulla ; it is rough and strong, and in 

 the specimen descends two-thirds the length of the latter process, the tip being 

 broken off. The ossa parietalia, ossified into one symmetrical bone, in ad- 

 vance of the ossa tempora are nearly cylindrical and antero-inferiorly join the 

 alispheuoid. Between the ossa squamosa, the two at their narrowest portion 

 measure only 7-lOths of an inch across. They are surmounted by a strong 

 sagittal crest with a broad base, which in the specimen has been broken away. 

 Laterally in advance of the squamous suture, is a remarkable anil vertical, 

 moderately deep and broad groove, the office of which I cannot conjecture. 

 The squamous suture partakes of the serrated form. 



Measurements. — From one lateral groove of the parietalia to the other measures 

 1 and 7-lOths of an inch ; the distance between the glenoid cavities, 1 and 

 S-lOths inch ; from the posterior face of the posterior glenoid tubercle to the an- 

 terior boundary of the anterior glenoid tubercle is 1 and 2-lOths inch ; from one 

 foramen ovale to the other 4-lOths of an inch. 



Remarks, — From the very great strength of the base of support of the zygo- 

 matic process ; the comparative size and concealed position of the glenoid 

 cavity ; the great size of the posterior glenoid tubercle ; and the great extent 

 of the temporal fossa, (for although it is shortened by the very rapid ascent of 

 the superior root of the zygoma and advancement of occiput, yet it is increased 

 in extent by the very great vertical development of the squamous bone, and in 

 depth by the comparatively depressed or flattened surface of the latter, ) the 

 Eucrotaphus has been endowed with very great power in the muscles of mas- 

 tication and great freedom of movement in the articulation of the lower jaw. 



The position of this genus I have not been able satisfactorily to determine 

 from the specimen, and we must wait, therefore, until other parts of the cra- 

 nium of the animal are found before we can be able to detect its true place 

 among the orders. 



The species I have named Eucrotaphus Jacksoni, in honor of my esteemed 

 friend Dr. Samuel Jackson, the eminent teacher of the Institutes of Medicine 

 in the University of Pennsylvania. 



The second fossil fragment, which I have named Archaeotherium, appears to 

 have belonged to an animal not remotely allied to the Anoplotherium. The 

 specimen is part only of the face, consisting of the middle portion of the left 

 OS masillare superius, with the corresponding portion of the palate process^ 

 containing two premolar teeth and the alveolus for a third, a fragment of the 

 upper part of the right os maxillare superius, the central portion of the two 

 ossa nasi, and the anterior extremity of the left os mala. In general form this 

 part of the face is prolonged like that of the Anoplotherium, and in size was 

 ^t least one-half greater than the A. commune. 




1860.] 93 



The anterior of the tw^o teeth in the fragment appears to he the first premolar, 

 corresponding to that tooth in the Anoplotherium hy its double fang. The 

 body of the tooth is not so broad as in the latter, and is more conical. It is 

 convex externally from side to side, and the base of the enamel is elevated, 

 rounded and deeply emarginate at the position corresponding to the separation 

 of the fangs, but it projects at no place beyond the general surface of the 

 crown except posteriorly where it forms a slight ledge or heel. Interiorly the 

 general surface is convex, but it rather forms a central rounded longitudinal 

 prominence from which the surface passes off slightly concave posteriorly and 

 to an elevated line at the antero-interior border of the tooth. The enamel 

 has been worn off at the end and along its posterior border. The second 

 premolar is implanted in the alveolous by three fangs, two externally and the 

 other internally. The body of the tooth is cuboidal, but is greater in its 

 transverse measurement than antero-posterlorly. The external face is con- 

 vex from side to side, and is not so long as that of the first premolar. The 

 enamel base is strongly emarginate between the fangs, is prominent, rounded, 

 and projects into a narrow edge anteriorly and posteriorly about 2| lines below 

 its edge. The anterior surface is directed obliquely inward and forward. The 

 crown has been worn down, leaving exposed a large, transversely oval islet of 

 dentine, which is continuous with a similarly exposed surface antero-exter- 

 nally. The posterior surface is nearly transverse, and is worn into a concave 

 depression from the pressure of the succeeding tooth in the row. The fangs 

 are large and strong ; the antero-external is implanted in the jaw obliquely 

 upward and forward, and the postero-external vertically ; the interior is larger 

 than the other and is placed on a line posterior to the antero-external fang. 



The interspace between the first and second premolars is triangular, and 

 from the attrition upon the posterior surface of the former and anterior of the 

 latter, has been occupied in a state of rest, by the body of the first premolar of 

 the inferior maxilla. 



Posterior to the second premolar, the sockets alone for the three fangs of 

 the third premolar exist in the specimen. 



The surface of the superior maxillary bone is convex from above downwards. 

 The infra-orbitar foramen, from a smooth notch existing inthe specimen, appears 

 to have been placed at the junction of the superior maxillary with the malar 

 bone. The palatine process is 3 lines in depth from the edge of the alveolus. 

 The ossa nasi are transversely convex. 



Measurements— The heighth of the superior maxillary bone from the lateral 

 nasal suture to the edge of the alveolus on a line with a second premolar, is 

 3^ inches ; breadth of os nasi on the same line f of an inch ; breadth of first 

 premolar at base externally 1^ inches ; transversely ^ an inch ; second 

 premolar antero-posterlorly f of an inch ; transversely | of an inch ; heighth 

 of face from middle nasal suture to the roof of the mouth on a line with the 

 first premolar 2^ Inches, on a line with the third premolar 3 inches. 



The species of Archaeotherium I have named Mortoni in honor of my 

 friend Dr. Samuel George Morton, the excellent President of this Academy.

By Richard C. Taylor. 



There appear to be some peculiarities, not readily accounted for, in the 

 periods of Rainy and Dry seasons upon the Isthmus of Panama, at points 

 which are not very far distant from each other, on the same coast. 



Thus, the rainy season at Escribanos, in the Province of Veragua, we un- 

 derstand, is the reverse of that at Chagres, which place is situated at only 

 sixty or seventy miles distance. 



At Chagres, the dry season begins in December and ends in May, and the 

 principal rainy months are those between May and November. 



On the other hand, at Escribanos, the most rainy months are those which 

 extend from November to the end of March. The inhabitants at this time are 

 confined to their houses and have few opportunities of getting out of their 

 doors. What is called the dry season in this vicinity, is from April to the 

 end of October. Still, storms and showers occur almost daily in those months ; 

 and, in reference to the entire year at Escribanos, we remember the somewhat 

 vague remark of the French Negro proprietor there — "it rains every time." 




1850.] 95 



This constant progression of vast masses of rapor, of copious showers, and 

 successive thunderstorms, along the mountainous but broken range of the 

 Isthmus, appears to be chiefly from the equator, northward. 



More than forty years ago, the celebrated Humboldt offered an explanation 

 of the causes which occasioned the insupportable heat and dryness of the Old 

 World, within the limits of the torrid zone, and the comparative coolness and 

 continu5^d humidity of the same parallel on the New Continent. These views 

 are repeated in the same author's recent work on the " Aspects of Nature." I 

 may be permitted to give the substance of them here. 



In the sandy deserts of Africa, the vertically ascending column of warm air 

 prevents the vesicles of vapor from being dissolved. The more complete the 

 absence of vegetation and the more the sand is heated, the greater is the height 

 of the clouds, and the less can any fall of rain take place. Thus, in deserts, 

 the want of rain and the absence of vegetation, act and react upon each other. 

 It does not rain, because the naked, sandy surface, having no vegetable cover- 

 ing, becomes more powerfully heated by the solar rays, and thus radiates more 

 heat ; and the absence of rain forbids the desert being converted into a steppe 

 or grassy plain, because without water no organic development is possible. 



On the contrary, in the New World, beneath the torrid zone, among other 

 causes that tend to create a cooler and moister climate, are enumerated the 

 impenetrable forests which occupy the alluvial plains which are situated imme- 

 diately beneath the equator ; protecting with their shade the soil beneath from 

 the direct influence of the sun beams, and exhaling in the interior of the 

 country, at a great distance from the mountains and from the ocean, vast quan- 

 tities of moisture, partly imbibed and partly elaborated. It is to the same causes 

 that we are to attribute the luxuriant vegetation, the magnificent forests and 

 that abundant leafiness by which the New Continent is peculiarly characterized.

 By Joseph Leidt, M. D. 



1. LiGCLA Tritonis. — Body ribbon-like, thin, translucent, nearly smooth; 

 faintly yellowish white, posteriorly obtusely rounded. Head thickened 

 rounded, transversely corrugated, yellowish ; extremity triangularly rounded 

 laterally compressed, front and back, with a short, longitudinal, contracted de 

 pression. 



Whole length 1 in. 9 lines ; breadth of body l-3d line, thickness l-12thline 

 length of head 1 line, breadth l-4th line, thickness l-9th line. 



Habitation and Remarks. — This species was sent to me by my friend Prof. 

 S. F. Baird, of Carlisle, with the note " Found imbedded in the muscles of the 

 back of Triton (Cynops) dorsalis." It is the smallest species which has as yet 

 been discovered, and the first among batrachian reptiJia. The specimen sent 

 to me consisted of two fragments of the same individual preserved in alcohol. 

 Examined beneath the microscope it presented no trace of articulation or in- 

 terior definite organs. 



2. Pentastomcm Didelphidis Virginianie. — Body subcylindrical, curved one- 

 third or one-half a circle, dorsum convex, bentrum concave, posteriorly nar- 

 rowed and constricted a short distance from the extremity, which is rounded. 

 Color white, opaque. Composed of forty or fewer annulatiions. Head poste- 

 riorly convex, anteriorly plain or slightly concave ; mouth nearly round ; hooks 

 simple, situated in a curved line of which the mouth forms the centre. 



Whole length 3 to 5 lines, breadth 3-5th of a line ; annuli generally l-80th 

 inch wide ; mouth l-200th inch in diameter ; hooks l-200th inch long. 



Habitation and Remarks. — I found 9 individuals of this entozoon, in C. shaped 

 cysts, the circle being two lines in diameter, imbedded in the liver just beneath 

 the peritoneal surface, in Didelphis virginiana. It may probably be the Pen- 

 tastovium subcylindricum of Dlesing,* which was found in cysts upon the liver 

 of two South American species of Didelphis, and several other animals, but the 

 largest of those found in our D. virginiana, is equal only to the smallest of P. 

 subcylindricum, and has not more than one-half the number of annulations.

Kotes on the Development of the Gordius aquaiicus. 

 By Joseph Leidt, M. D. 

 Just four years ago I exhibited to the Academy a mass of living hair-worms 

 or Gordius aquaticus, consisting of fourteen individuals strangely knotted 

 together, and recalling the appropriateness of the Linnsean name. 



It is a vulgar opinion that the Gordius is a horse hair which has become 

 vivified from maceration for several weeks in a spring or pool of fresh water, 

 an error which has probably arisen from their frequently being found in water 

 filling a wagon rut, or the drinking trough of a horse. I have even been in- 

 formed by some persons, though by those not given to observe such matters, 

 that they had perceived the direct transmutation of horse hairs into writhing 

 worms and I was at one time so silly as to be led to try the experiment, with 

 what success it is unnecessary for me to state. 



The Gordii alluded to in the mass, were blackish brown in color, from C to 

 10 inches in length, and most of them had attached to the posterior extremity oi 

 the body a long, white, opaque cord, in several instances nearly as long and 

 as thick as the worms themselves. These cords some of the members may re- 

 collect I pointed out at the time as being strings of the ova of the Gordii, but 

 ' i then was not so well acquainted with the history of the Gordius as at present; 

 that is to say, I did not know that we have no knowledge whatever of its origin 

 or developement, and although through curiosity I traced for a few days the 

 development of the embryo in ova, yet I did not do it with that care which its 

 importance demanded. But however imperfect have been the observations 

 made, with this acknowledgment, I have thought it would be well to record 

 them, with the hope that they may not only throw some light upon the obscure 

 nature of the Gordius, but also lead others to the discovery of a similar oppor- 

 tunity of investigating this animal under more favorable circumstances of lo- 

 ' cality and information. The observations I have withheld for a length of time, 

 "" ^ in the hope that I might be able to verify or correct them, but failing to do so to 

 ' the present time, I now reluctantly put them forth from my notes taken at the 



time. 



The white cords before mentioned consisted of numerous oval ova closely 



*Naturgesohichte S. 151, Taf. 11. 




1850.] 99 



aggregated together. These when examined beneath the microscope, on the 

 first day after I obtained them, exhibited a white, granular yoke divided into 

 four globular masses connected together and surrounded by a transparent al- 

 bumen. Each mass contained in its centre a clear cell or vesicle. On the second 

 day the separation among the yolk masses was less distinct and upon the third 

 day the whole had united into one oval, finely granular body, aud the interior 

 vesicles had disappeared, ^he fourth and fifth days no perceptible change was 

 observable. From the sixth to the eighth day the yolk had become conical in 

 form, and upon the ninth day the base of the cone exhibited a cleft or fissure 

 which by the tenth day had extended two-thirds of the length of the mass. During 

 the whole of this period the yolk retained its granular character and was mo- 

 tionless. Upon the eleventh day it resembled a cylinder doubled upon itself, or 

 the outline of the embryo had been forward, and one extremity of it, corres- 

 ponding to the head, had become translucent from a solution of the granular- 

 matter within. The other or tail end was subacute. The twelfth day the trans- 

 lucency had extended itself in the interior part of the embryo, the extremity 

 of which had advanced beyond the others, aud presented an emargination com- 

 municating with an orifice opening into a canal visible in the interior, and from 

 the edge of the exti'emity was developed a circle of short filaments which pro- 

 jected downwards and outwards. From the thirteenth to the fifteenth day the 

 granular matter had entirely undergone solution within the anterior half of the 

 embryo, and the latter had become somewhat dilated. The interior canal was 

 also more distinct, and the bordering filaments of the extremity were larger. 

 In the course of the sixteenth to the eighteenth day the translucent half of the 

 animal was separated from the other by a constriction, and the canal in the 

 interior presented at its anterior portion a clavate tubular body, the free end 

 of which projected from the oral aperture. The extremity of the head was sur- 

 rounded by a reflected collar from the free bordei of which projected the fila- 

 mentary appendages. The posterior half of the embryo was still granular in 

 appearance, but had become rounded and somewhat dilated at the extremity. 

 From the nineteenth to the twentieth day, the embryo alternately retracted and 

 protruded the tentacular or filamentary appendages, aud the integument of 



' the anterior half of the body appeared to be getting annulated, which was dis- 

 tinctly so by the twenty-first day. The granular matter in the posterior part of 



^'' the body was also undergoing solution from the periphery towards the centre, 

 and at its posterior part there appeared several large oil globules. On the twenty- 

 second day the annulations of the anterior half of the body were very distinct, 

 the posterior half was also becoming annulated, and near its extremity I for 



"the first time observed an anal orifice and one to four small epidermal spines. 

 On the twenty-fourth day the tubular clavate organ before mentioned, occupy- 

 ing the anterior part of the alimentary canal, was alternately protruded and re- 

 tracted as a proboscis. The proboscis when fully protruded brought into view 

 at its base, a second circle of tentacular filaments within the first. On the 

 twenty-sixth day the embryo when pressed from the egg progressed forward by 

 moving the posterior half of its body from side to side, aud it alternately pro- 

 truded and retracted the proboscis and the two circles of tentacular filaments. 

 When all the latter organs were retracted, the head presented a truncate or 

 depressed surface, and in their protrusion the extremities of the outer circle of 




100 [Oct. 



tentaculje and the end of the proboscis first became visible ; as these advanced 

 the second circle of tentaculje appeared, and when the probo><ci8 was entirely 

 protruded, the outer tentacnla? were deeply reflected npon the outside of the 

 body, and the inner circle projected obliciuely outward and upward. The pro- 

 boscis was clavate in form, or cylindrical and moderately dilated at its free end, 

 and more so at its base. The following six days no perceptible change was ob- 

 servable in the development of the animal, and after this the eggs showed evi- 

 dent appearances of decay, and I gave them no further attention.

The Committee on the following paper by Mr. Cassin, read at last 

 meeting, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



Descriptions of new species of Birds of the Generi Parus, Linn. ; Emberiza, 

 Linn.; Carduelis, Briss. ; Myiothera, Lll. : and Leuconerpes, Sw., specimens 

 of which are in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Pkiladul- 

 phia. 



By Joun Cassix. 

 1. Pants annexus, nobis. 



Form. — Crested ; bill strong, conical ; fourth and fifth quills longest and 

 equal, wings and tail rather long, crest pointed. 



Dimensions. — Total length (of skin) from tip of bill to en 1 of tail about 5 

 inches, wing 2\, tail 2^ inches. 



Colors. — Sex unknown. Anterior feathers of the crest black at their ba'g'es 

 and cinereous at their tips, the most elongated of the succeeding entirely black, 

 others margined with white, shorter occipital feathers black ; chin and throat 

 black. Wide line from above the eye running into the crest, thence around 

 upon the side of the neck, white. Line commencing behind tht eye, running 

 thence around and uniting with the space of the same color upon the throat, 

 black, cheeks white. Entire superior surface cinereous, tinged with olive, quills 

 and tail feathers brownish black, primaries narrowly edged externally with 

 white, secondaries and tail feathers edged externally with asby olive. Body 

 beneath ashy white, darker upon the breast. Bill black. 

 % Hah. — Texas, upon the Rio Grande, discovered by Mr. John Woodhouse 

 Audubon. 



Obs. — This very remarkable species, discovered in Texas by a son of the 

 illustrious naturalist of the same name, is marked upon the head more like 

 the P. cris'atus of Europe than any other American epecies yet known. It 

 does not resemble that species in any other character, however, being more 

 strictly related to P. bicolor, Linn, and P. inornatus, Gamb., and like tliem 

 belonging to the genus Lophophanes, Kaup. 

 2. Parus atricristatus, nobis. 



Form. — Crested, wings and tail rather long. Crest pointed as in P. bicolor, 

 Linn., bill strong, conical. Specimen now described not in mature plumage. 

 Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 5 inches, 

 wing 2|, tail 21 inches. 



Colors. — Sex unknown. Crest black, front and under parts of the body ashy 

 white, flanks ferrugineous ; entire superior surface cinereous, darker upon the 

 wings and tail, and inclining to olivaceous upon the back. Bill and legs black. 

 Shafts of primaries reddish at their bases, those of the tail feathers white be- 

 neath. 

 HaJ). — Texas, on the Rio Grande, discovered by Mr. J. Woodhouse Audubon. 

 Obs. — This species is of the same general form and color as P. bicolor, Linn. 

 ;rand P. inornatus, Gamb. ; smaller than the former, but about the size o^ the lat- 

 ter. It may be easily recognized by its black pointed crest and white front, 

 which, so far as I know, are peculiar characters. This species, like the preced- 

 ing, was discovered in Texas by Mr. Audubon, and belongs to the same genus. 

 3. Emberiza bHineata, nobis. 

 Form. — Bill strong ; wings short, with the second third and fourth prima- 




104 [Oct. 



ries longest and nearly equal, som-i of the secondarie.? emar^^inate. Legs an I 

 feet rather long. Aberrant, may not belong to this genus. 



Dimensions.— Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 5 

 inches, wing 2 and 4-lOths, tail 2 and 2-l()th inches. 



Colors. — Sex unknown. Line from the nostril running above the eye to- 

 wards the occiput, and another from the angle of the lower mandible running 

 upon the side of the neck, white, space between those lines inclnding the narea 

 and plumage under the eye and the ears, nearly black. Tiiroat from the base 

 of the bill, black, which color is bounded on each side by the white lines from 

 the angles of the lower mandible, and continues to a somewhat rounded point 

 upon the breast. Head and body above darlc cinereous, inclining to brownish 

 upon the back and wing coverts. Quills brownish. Tail brownish black, ex- 

 ternal feathers having their outer webs pure white and tipp.-d with the same 

 color, the brown color of these feathers extending narrowly along the shafts 

 into the white tips. Body beneath white, tinged wiih cinereous. Bill bluish 

 horn color. 



Hah. — Texas, on the Rio Grande, discovered by Mr. John Woodhouse 

 Audubon. 



Qijg_ This is one of the most remarkable finches yet discovered in America, 



and is quite unlike, even in general appearance, any other species of this 

 country with which I am acquainted. This bird was also brought frem Texas 

 by Mr. Audubon. 



4. Ember iza Belli, nobis. 



porm. "Wings rather short, second, third and fourth quills longest ana 



nearly equal. Tail and legs rather long. 



Dimensions — rj* Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 5} 

 inches, wing 2|, tail 3 inches. 



Colors, (^ Head and neck above cinereous, shading into olive upon the back 



and neck. 



Frontal spots on each side of the base of the bill, (scarcely united) narrow 

 ring around the eye, and entire under surface white. Edge of the wing at flex- 

 ure yellow ; superior wing coverts brown tinged with ferruginous, quills and 

 tail brownish black, nearly all the feathers of both narrowly edged with whit- 

 ish most apparent upon both webs of the external tail feathers. Conspicuous 

 spot upon the breast, nares, and lines from the external angles of lower man- 

 dible running downwards upon the sides of the neck, deep brownish black. 

 Flanks tinged with rufous and with a few longitudinal stripes of brown. 



J"' Slightly smaller, flanks and interior tail coverts more tinged with rufous. 



jjab. — California, near Sonoma and San Diego ; discovered by Mr. John G. 



Bell. 



Qls. This species resembles in rather a remarkable degree the Emberiza 



hypochondria, D'Orb. Voy. Merid. Ois. pi. 45, fig. 1, but is smaller and with- 

 out the deep castaneous flanks of that species. In the bird now described, the 

 dark spot upon the white breast is a striking feature, and is much more 

 strongly pronounced than in any other with which I am acquainted. 



I have named this species in honor of Mr. John G. Bell, of the city of New 

 York, a gentleman possessing a very extensive knowledge of natural history, 

 and whose attachment to the pursuit of which, induced him to make the visit 

 to California, which resulted in the discovery of this and other interesting birds.

The followiug is Mr. Bell's note relating to this species : "This bird I shot 

 first near Sonoma, and afterwards at San Diego ; its habits much resemble those 

 of the painted bunting, (5. ciris.) I observed several of them amongst the 

 wormwood at the Jdge of the hills, sitting on the tops of the small bushes, 

 singing, and when disturbed would dart downwards. The song is quite unlike 

 that of any of our finches, rather low and plaintive, and perhaps most, resem- 

 bles that of the Swamp sparrow, (Amm. palustris.) It is neither a very ac- 

 tive nor a shy bird, and was not rare at the localities mentioned.'' "' ^ '' ■ 



In a collection of birds deposited in this Academy by Mr. E. L. Kern, and 

 collected by him while with the expedition of Col. Fremont, in 1846, there 

 is a specimen of a young bird very much resembling that now described, but 

 much larger, being about the size of the E. hypochondria, D'Orb., and is, I think 

 an unknown species. The specimen is not only in bad plumage, but so much 

 injured as scarcely to admit of being mounted. 



5. Carcludis Laiurencei, nobis. 



Form. — Bill rather conical, three outer primaries longest and nearly equal ; 

 tail coverts long, tail emarginate. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 41 

 inches, -wing 2 and 8-lOths, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. — (^. Head above and a small space around the bill and upon the throat 

 black ; head behind and sides of the neck pale cinereous, shading into fine brown - 

 ish olive upon the back, and into a paler cinereous upon the sides under the 

 wings, nearly white upon the abdomen and inferior tail coverts. Lesser and 

 exposed portion of greater wing coverts, rump, breast and belly fine pale 

 yellow ; upper tail coverts cinerous. Spurious wing, black, conspicuous. 



Quills brownish black, primaries and succeeding and secondaries externally 

 edged with yellow ; shorter secondaries edged and tipped with ashy white. 

 Tail brownish black, the external feathers each with a large spot of white on 

 its inner web, very conspicuous. 



Hab. — Sonoma and San Diego, California, discovered by Mr. John G. Bell. 



9 . without black upon the head or throat, those parts being brownish 

 olive ; the yellow color upon the inferior surface more restricted. 



Obs. — This beautiful littlt^bird resembles no other Carduelis which has come 

 under my notice. Mr. Bell's note respecting it is as follows : " This bird I first 

 observed at Sonoma. In habits it much resembled our common Goldfinch (C 

 tristis.} The flock, out of which I shot these two, was feeding in company with 

 the small black headed species ( C. psaltria, ) on the seeds of plants growing near 

 the ground, and when disturbed alighted upon the nearest bushes. When flying 

 they keep up a constant chattering or calling like our common species. I also 

 saw this bird at San Diego, feeding as above in company with the crimson 

 fronted Bullfinch, {Erijthrospiza frontalis,) in the open prairie. I never saw it 

 in the mountains." 



I have named this bird in honor of Mr. George N. Lawrence, of the city of 

 New York, a gentleman whose acquirements, especially in American Orni- 

 thology, entitle him to a high rank amongst naturalists, and for whom I have 

 a particular respect, because, like myself, in the limited leisure allowed by the 

 vexations and discouragements of commercial life, he Is devoted to the more 

 grateful pursuits of natural history.

lOG [Oct. 



6. Myiothera nudiceps, nobis. 



Form. — Upper part of bead bald or witli a few bristle like feathers, wing 

 with the fifth quill slightly longest, tail short, legs long. General form much 

 like M. longipes, (Vieill.) 



Dhn-nsions. — Total length of skill from tip of bill to end of tail about 6^ 

 inches, wing 3 and l-8th, tail 2\ inches. 



Colors. — ^. Naked space Upon the head blue. Entire plumage black. Wing 

 coverts delicately edged with white, which is also the color of the basal portion 

 of the fi-athers of the back, (apparent only upon raising them.) Irides white. 



Ha'i. — Panama; discovered by Mr. John G. Bell. 



06.S. — This species may readily be distinguished from others of its genus by 

 its bald head, the naked skin of which in the living bird is, as Mr. Bell informs 

 me, " Mazarine blue." His note is as follows : "These birds keep on the ground, 

 running and scratching among the leaves, like the others of the same family 

 which I send, and somewhat like our small Thrushes, (M. mustelina and soli- 

 taria.) They were constantly calling and singing a short, loud, and very curious 

 song, which varied in several of its notes at different times, and is entirely 

 different from that of any of our birds. This species appeared to me to be rather 

 a stupid bird, and was easily approached ; it has' a habit of puffing up the 

 feathers on its back ; the head in recently killed specimens in beautiful 

 Mazarine blue. It was represented to me as a very rare bird by several resi- 

 dents at Panama." r. ,. » 



7. Leuconerpes albolarvatiis, nobis. 



Form, — Robust, wings with the fourth primary longest, secondaries broad, 

 abruptly terminated, sub-emarginate ; tail rather long, with the feathers soft 

 at the ends. Legs and feet rather slender. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 9 inches, 

 wing 5, tail 3^ inches. 



Colors. — ^ . Wide mask including greater part of the head and extending 

 upon the breast, white, which is also the color of a basal portion of both webs 

 of the primaries, and upon the outer webs in a few feathers extends for two- 

 thirds of their length. Narrow occipital band scarlet. All other parts, includ- 

 ing body above and below, wings and tail, black. 



9 . Similar, but rather smaller, and without the occipital band of scarlet. 



Hai). — Near Sutter's mill, California, discovered by Mr. John G. Bell. 



Ohs. — Mr. Bell's note accompanying this very interesting species is as follows: 

 " I shot this bird at the Oregon canon, near Georgetown, about 12 miles from 

 Sutter's mill ; it seemed to prefer the tall pine trees, and generally kept very 

 high. In habits it appeared very much like the P. villosus- Its note is clear 

 and sharp, and it is very active and lively in its movements." Ha; no near 

 relative yet discovered in North America, and resembles in general characters 

 only the L. dominicanus, (Vieill.) Spix. Av. Bras. pi. 50.

Descriptions of three FilaricB. 

 By Joseph Leidy, M. D. 

 1. Filahia. Hominis oris. — Body white, opaque, linear, thread-like; mouth 

 round, simple ; posterior extremity obtuse, furnished with a short, curved, epider- 

 mal hooklet l-500th in. in length, by l-2000th in. in diameter at base. 



PROCEED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OF PHILADELPHIA. — VOL. V. NO, VI. 




118 [Nov. 



Length 5 inches 7 lines, greatest breadth 1-C6th in.; breadth at mouth l-230th 

 in.; at posterior extremity l-80th in. 



Remarks. — The ilescription is taken from a single specimen preserved in alco- 

 hol, in the collection of the Academy, labelled "obtained from the mouth of a 

 child." 



Is it a young individual, or perhaps a male of the Filaria medinensis, or Guinea- 

 worm / The latter, as is well known, infests the human body, often growing to 

 an enormous length, several yards or more, in the intertropicsof Asia and Africa. 

 It is frequently brought in the body of negro slaves from Africa to America^ 

 where no entozoon of the kind has ever been noticed to be parasitic in man as an 

 indigenous production. From some late observations on the course of life of 

 entozoa, helminthologists have been led to suspect that most, and probably all en- 

 tozoa pass different stages of their existence in different animals. If such be the 

 fact, may the Filaria medinensis not owe its introduction into the human body, 

 from the custom which prevails in those countries, where the worm is found, of 

 using insect food ? Insects are well known to be infested with Filariae, probably 

 more than any other class of animals. In Kgypt, Arabia, &c., the locust i^ 

 eaten; in Guinea, &c., the larger coleoptera ; in the raw state, and in this con- 

 dition Filaria; may often be swallowed, and reach a higher developement of their 

 existence in the human body. 



2. FiLAiiiA Ciniis cordis. — Body white, opaque, linear, nearly uniform 

 throughout, posteriorly subulate, pointed ; mouth simple, round. 



Length 10 to lOi inches, greatest breadth 2-.5th of a line, anteriorly l-5th of a 

 line; half an inch from posterior end, 1-lOth of a line. 



Remarks. — The description is taken from two individuals preserved in alcohol, 

 in the collection of the Academy, presented by Dr. R. Coates, who obtained 

 them, according to the label upon the bottle, from the parietes of the heart of a 

 dog. 



3. Filaria Bo<b co7/strictoris. 



9 . Body white, cylindrical ; integument translucent, longitudinally striated ; 

 mouth simple, round; oesophagus cylindrical, opaque white; intestine opa- 

 lescent, cylindrical, tortuous, corrugated, wider than the oesophagus; anus 

 terminal, round ; generative aperture close to the mouth ; ovaries two, very long 

 and very tortuous. 



Remarks, — The description is taken from two specimens; one 10 inches long, 

 by 4-5ths of a line wide, the other 6i in. long by 3-5ths of a line wide. In the former 

 the oesophagus is 9 lines long and l-3d of a line wide, the intestine 13 in. long 

 and 3-5ths of a line wide. 



Habitaiioii. — Found in the areolar tissue, in an irregular or tortuous position, 

 between the muscles of the ribs and the integument of a Boa constrictor. 



Note. — In the same Boa constrictor, which was dissected by my friend Dr. 

 Hallowell and myself, we found in the right lung 6 females, 4 males, and a very 

 young individual of Pentastomum proboscideum, and in the ureters of the kidnies 

 2G individuals of Distomum horridum.

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A communication was read from the Minister of Public Works of 

 France, dated Paris, Sept. 5th, 1850, accompanying a number of Vols, 

 of the "Journal des Mines," and of the " Annales des Mines," which 

 had been deficient in the series of that Work in the Library of the 

 Academy ; — and also asking in return, certain numbers of the Journal 

 and Proceedings of this Institution. 



A letter was read from Professor Nillson of Sweden, dated Lund, 

 Sept. 30th, 1850, returning acknowledgments for his election as a Cor- 

 respondent of the Academy, and staling his intention to present a copy of 

 his work on the Fauna of Scandinavian Vertebrata ; and also offering 

 to procure for the Academy, Zoological specimens of that country, if 

 desirable. Referred to the Zoological Committee. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper entitled " New genera of Vermes," which, 

 being intended for publication in the Proceedings, was referred to Drs. 

 Zantzinger, B. H. Coates and Hallowell. 



December lOt/i. 

 Vice-President Bridges, in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy exhibited several raolar teeth and fragments of maxillae 

 of a fossil Rhinoceros, from Missouri territory, received from the 

 Smithsonian Institution through Prof. Baird, which indicate a species 

 little more than half the size of the recent R. indicus. He character- 

 ized it under the name of R. occidentalis. 



Dr. Leidy also exhibited drawings, and offered the following remarks 

 on the nettling organs of the Hydra : — 



There are three different forms of these organs. The first are of comparatively 

 large size, and are pyriform in shape, measuring about l-1700ths in. in length, 

 by l-2125ths in. in breadth. They are found principally upon the arms, and 

 anterior two thirds of the surface of the body, although they are found upon the 

 posterior third also, but few in number. Colorless and transparent, they contain 

 within them an elongated pyramidal body about l-3400ths in. in length, the apex 

 of which is in contact with, or slightly protrudes from, the projecting extremity 

 of the nettling cell ; the base is divided into four lobes and rests upon a prolate 

 spheroid body which has its other extremity applied to the middle of the concav- 

 ity of a cup-shaped mass of faintly yellowish matter occupying the inferior third 

 or bas-fond of the receptacle. The pyramidal body is described by Corda* as 

 being a calcareous dart capable of protrusion from the cell, but incorrectly, 

 for when it is forced from its receptacle, it divides into four spine-like 

 processes, which project outward nearly at right angles to the extruded mass. 

 The intervals unoccupied, and the bodies just describ»d within the cell are filled 



•Nov. Act. Phys. Med. 1S36, p. 301. 




120 |Di.c. 



with a transparant colorless fluiil. When tho Hydra brings its arms in contact 

 with its prey, the projecting ends of those iiettlinij; cells which touch it appear to 

 adhere to the captured aninnal, and in the slruj;;^les ol" the latter, a delicate thread 

 from the nettling cell is observed to be attached to the prey which is lengthened 

 in the movements of the latter, entangling its limbs ; and if the struggling con- 

 tinues or the prisoner escapes, it will be found to have several of the nettling 

 cells, torn from the Hydra, adhering by the long delicate threads. In the detach- 

 ment of the nettling cells, after considerable elongation of the thread, the whole 

 of the interior mechanism is first withdrawn from the cell and adheres to its pro- 

 jecting end, as a cylindrical mass, faintly outlined, with a pyramidal summit 

 from which proceeds the thread, and from the upper third of its sides, rise out-* 

 wardly like springs, nearly at right angles to it, the four spinous processes be- 

 fore mentioned. The nettling cell itself, appears darkly outlined from the thick- 

 ness of its wall, and is much narrower than in the ordinary condition from the loss 

 of a considerable part of its contents, and within is nothing else but a clear fluid. 

 The traction continuing, the whole cell and appurtenances become detached from 

 the Hydra. The thread which originated in the interior of the cell appears to be 

 of a viscid character, for if any of these cells of the arms of the Hydra come in 

 contact with its own body, they adhere with such tenacity, that the former can 

 only be detached, at the expense of the loss of several of the nettling cells. From 

 the detached cells often being found attached to the Hydra itself by the long 

 threads, some observers, as Ehrenberg,* have considered that they were organs, 

 which the animal threw out from itself like anchors. 



The second form of nettling organs, are found arranged in more or less regular 

 circles around the first or largest form, usually nine to fourteen in a circle. 

 They are transparent, pyriform, about l-3400th in. in length by ] -5666th in. in 

 breadth, and have projecting from the prominent extremity a cilium about l-875th 

 in. in length. These cells are described by Corda as containiiig a thick walled 

 sac, adhering to the outer cell at the base of the cilium. According to my obser- 

 vations, the appearance of an inner sac arises from a contained thread which 

 forms a double spiral, one end of which forms the cilium projecting from the 

 nettling cell. 



The third form of nettling organs, are found in greatest abundance about the 

 head of the animal, but also exist upon the arms, particularly at the lower part, 

 and upon the surface of the body generally. This form appears never to have 

 been before noticed. They are oblong, transparent cells, about l-2125th in. long 

 by l-5GGGth in. broad, and contain within them a spiral thread, more delicate than 

 in the second form of cells, and have a greater number of turns which take a 

 direction transversely to the length of the cell. They resemble very much in 

 their appearance one of the forms of nettling cells of Corynactis, figured by All- 

 man in the 17th vol. of the Annals of Natural History, PI. 11, fig. 4. I have never 

 been able to see the threads prolonged externally, on account of their minuteness, 

 in contact with the prey of the Hydra j but by pressure and the continued en- 

 dosmosis of water I have detected them protruded in this as well as the second 

 form described. 



All the forms of nettling organs are placed within especial organic cells, adher- 



•See Arch. fQr Naturgesch. 1842, p. 71. 




1850.] 121 



ing by the more prominent extremity of the organ to that part of the interior pa- 

 rietes of the cell, corresponding to the free surface of the animal upon which they 

 are placed. Their developement is special from the granular contents of the or- 

 ganic cells and not from the nucleus, for in the first or largest form of nettling 

 organs, in their developement upon a bud of the Hydra, T have been able to detect 

 one within an organic cell, and a nucleolated nucleus at its side. 



The foregoing observations have been made in frequent efforts to detect some 

 form of cell within the head of the Hydra which would be different from the gene- 

 ral structure of the body, and probably characterize a nervous system, but although 

 I have examined the animal in different menstrua under a variety of circum- 

 stances, I have never been able to discover anything which could be referred to a 

 nervous structure. 



December Xlth. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A communication was read from the American Philosophical So- 

 ciety, dated Dec. 7th, 1850, acknowledging the reception of Part 1, 

 Vol. 2, of the Journal of the Academy. 



A communication was read from Dr. T. C. Henry, dated Albany, 

 Dec. 2d, 1850, in reference to two fishes from Oswego Lake, lately 

 presented by him to the Academy, and describing one of them as a 

 new species under the name of Centrarchus Oswego. On motion, the 

 communication was referred to a committee consisting of Mr. Cassin, 

 Dr. Fisher and Dr. Leidy. 



Dr. Leidy presented for the inspection of the members, fragments 

 of fossil mammalian remains, from Missouri Territory, received from 

 the Smithsonian Institution, through Prof. Baird, consisting of portions 

 of crania, maxillge and teeth, which he characterized under the names 

 of Rhinoceros nebraskensis — a species not much larger than a common 

 hog, — Palaeotherium Bairdii, Merycoidodon Culbertsonii, and Agrio- 

 ■^hoerus antiquus. 



1. Rhinoceros Nebraskensis. — A species founded upon a great portion of the 

 face, containing all the superior molar teeth ; an inferior maxilla with six 

 molars ; and three superior, apparently deciduous molars. It is about the same 

 size as the R. minutus of Cuvier. 



Length of line of seven superior molars, .... 4 7-10 inches. 



" " six inferior " .... 4 2-10 " 



Breadth of jaws from the first superior true molar teeth of one 



side to the other, ........ 3 g-lO " 



2. Agriochcertjs, 71. g. — Founded upon a great portion of the face and inferior 

 raaxilla, containing six molar teeth on each side, and the posterior two molars of 

 both sides superiorly of another individual. The posterior molars of this "enus 

 resemble in general form those of Merycopotamus, Fall-., 4- Cant., and are about 

 one-third smaller, but the outer demicones are not separated to the base -from 

 each other like the former, but are combined by a rounded column as in Hyo- 

 potamus bovinus. 




122 



[Dnc. 



The fourth premolar has four (iemieones, but the internal posterior one is rudi- 

 mentary. The third has two demicones; the external lar;^e, the internal snnall. 

 The second form, but a single cusp. The inferior true molars in ;;eneral form re- 

 semble those of Merycoidodon, but may at a glance be distinguished by the pos- 

 terior edge of the postero-external demicone bifurcating before it terminates, 

 sending one arm to join the internal angle of the posterior internal demicone ; the 

 other to join its posterior external face about the centre. 



Length of range of superior six molars, 3 in. 1 line. 



" '• inferior posterior five molars, . . . .3 " 1 " 



Breadth of face from one superior posterior molar to the other, 2 " 10 " 



The species he called A. antiquus. 



3. Pal^otheuium. — Remains of this genus have been previously discovered in 

 this country. Dr. Prout in Silliman's Journal, Vol. 3, n. s., p. 248, describes a 

 fragment of an inferior maxilla of a species larger than the P. magnum of 

 Cuvier. The species, for distinction, may be named P. Proutii. 



A second species was founded upon the cranium and a portion of the face con- 

 taining the true molars ; and the six superior and inferior molars of both sides of 

 another individual. This species is about two-thirds the size of P. crassum. The 

 arrangement of the superior molars is very like that of Paleotherium Hippoides. 

 Length of range of seven superior molars, .... 2 8-10 inches. 



« « seven inferior " .... 3 " 



Breadth of face on line with posterior superior molars, . 21 " 



This second species Dr. L. named P. Bairdii, in honor of Prof. S. F. Baird, 

 Curator of the Smithsonian Institution. 



Dr. Morton commenced a series of remarks on the embalmed heads 

 of ^lan, and the inferior animals from the Egyptian Catacombs ; previ- 

 ously to which, he exhibited a drawing mad« from one of the former, 

 which delineated with truthful pre- 

 cision the peculiar characteristics 

 of the Egyptian conformation. /^^^^^S'Mf^^ 

 The accompanying cut has been mW'ff''(:':f ^^^: 



made from the drawing : 



He called the attention of the Society 

 to the fact, that the mummied body 

 unwrapped by Mr. Gliddon, in Boston, 

 during the past year, is unequivocally 

 identified with the reign of Osorkon III, 

 by finding the cartouche or oval of that 

 King stamped in four different places on 

 a leather cross, placed diagonally on 

 the thorax in front. 



Osorkon belongs to the XXII Dynas- 

 ty, and his reign is placed between the 

 years 895 and 905 B. C; consequently 

 the present individual, who was Theban, 

 dates back about 2750 years. The physical characteristics are admirably in ac- 




1850.] 123 



cordance with those of the pure Egyptian race, as seen in the somewhat receding 

 forehead, the gently arched nose, slightly retracted chin, and general delicacy of 

 form and proportion of the facial bones. The hair was destroyed by the bitu- 

 menizing process, which has been performed in such excess as to efface the expres- 

 sion of the soft parts, and to render it impossible to measure the facial angle, or 

 the internal capacity of the cranium. 



There are one hundred and thirty embalmed Egyptian heads in the Collection 

 of the Academy, but none of them can be even proximately dated ; whence the 

 great interest that attaches to the present example. 



Two Egyptian heads were then unwrapped in the presence of the members. 

 They were both from Thebes, where they were procured by A. C. Harris, Esq. 

 of Alexandria, sent by him to Mr. Gliddon, and placed by the latter gentleman 

 in the collection of Dr. Morton. 



One of these heads, was of a man of 80 years, of Pelasgic or Graeco-Egyptian 

 form, with remarkably fine proportions and expression, and very fine hair, which 

 the embalming process had changed, as it always does, from a black to a dark 

 brown color. 



The second head was that of a female, which was unfortunately so broken 

 as to leave nothing but the cranial poition, and a profusion of the long, fine, 

 curling hair, which was one of the characteristics of the mctocthoiies of the 

 Nile. 



December 24fth. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Dr. John Evans, dated St. Louis, Mo., Dec.

Also one from the New York State Library, dated Albany, Dec. 

 20th, 1850, acknowledging the reception of Part 1, Vol. 2, New Series, 

 of the Journal. 



Also one of the same import from the Smithsonian Institution, dated 

 Washington, Dec. 3d, 18.50. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper intended for publication in the Proceed- 

 ings, entitled "Notice of an American species of Duck, hitherto regard-

Description of new genera of Vermes. 



By Joseph Leidy, M. I). 



1. Peloscolex. n.g. Setae in two rows, C to 10 in each fasciculus; podal 

 hooks in two rows, in twos or threes, bifurcated at the free extremity; each an- 

 nulation furnished with a circle of prominent tubercles, with numerous smaller 

 ones. Upper lip hardly projecting. Girdle not prominent. Blood red. 



1. PEL0scoi,t:x Variegatus. — Body cylindrical, posteriorly obtuse, anteriorly 

 sub-acute. Setae simple, usually 10 in each fasciculus anterior to the girdle, 

 absent in the posterior 22 annulations. Podal hooks anteriorly in threes, diver- 

 gent, strong, sigmoid, bifurcated at the extremity; posteriorly in twos, one rudi- 

 mentary. Each annulation furnished with a circlet of elevated, rounded tubercles, 

 1. sooth in. in heighth, and numerous smaller ones, also arranged in transverse 

 circles. Anterior, 3 or 4 annulations reddish ; after these 25 are deep black, 

 except the tenth or girdle, which is broad and brownish ; posterior annulations 

 red or brown. Upper lip so little projecting that the mouth appears almost termi- 

 nal, furnished with short, stiff hairs. Whole number of annulations 50. 



Length 4 lines; length of setce, l-133d in. to 1-SOth in.; length of podal hooks 

 l-400th in. to l-178th in. 



Hah it at ion, — Found in the spring of the year in the ferruginous mud at the 

 bottom of springs impregnated with iron, near Philadelphia.

JVais diaphina and Nais diastropha. Gruithuisen. Nov. act. nat. cur. 1825, 

 p. 407. 



Body cylindrical, elongate ; mouth inferior, large, triangular; anus terminal. 

 Podal spines in transverse fasciculi, inferior, simple ; the first pair of fasciculi 

 close to the mouth ; the second distant. Intestine straight, capacious. Eyes 

 none. Blood white. Increasing by division. Leidy. 



2. Chaetogaster GDLosus. — Body whitish, translucent; posteriorly obtuse, cili- 

 ated with long hairs ; mouth infero- terminal, large, triangular, simple; upper lipdi- 

 gitiform, ciliated, ffisophagus short, narrow; first stomach long, cylindrical, 

 transparent ; 2nd stomach large, oblong ; intestine straight, capacious. Podal 

 spines in pairs of fasciculi of 5 or 6 each, simple, divergent, curved backward 

 near the free end, retractile; first pair just posterior to each side of the mouth 

 inferiorly ; second pair removed far back. Usually found in the state of di- 

 vision ; commonly 2 to 4 subdivisions. 



First subdivision l-24th in. ; furnished wi*h 6 pairs of fasciculi of podal spines, 

 the second pair one half of the length of the subdivision from the first or oral 

 pair. Second subdivision 1-lOOth in. ; third, l-66th in. ; fourth 1-lOOth in. 

 Each of these latter furnished with 4 fasciculi of podal spines. 



Whole length, 1 line ; will contract to half a line ; breadth, l-140th in. ; 

 mouth, when open, l-250th in. ; length of podal spines, l-133d in. 



Habitation and Remarks. — Found abundantly with Hydra fusca, etc., in the 

 water of marshes in the vicinity of Philadelphia. This worm is very active in 

 its movements and very rapacious. Creeping upon bodies in the water, it 

 rapidly elongates the anterior part of its body in various directions, and swallows 

 great numbers of the smaller infusoria. In turn, it is much preyed upon by the 




1850.] 125 



Hydra fusca. When the anterior part of the body is elongated in search of 

 food, the mouth is much distended and terminal. 



3. Rhyxchoscolex, n. g. — Body cylindrical, soft, naked, transversely and 

 finely striated, vibrillated, anteriorly elongated into a proboscidiform appendage. 

 Mouth inferior; anus terminal. Intestine simple, straight. Eyes none. 



3. Rhynchoscolex simplex — Yellowish white, opaque, anteriorly abruptly 

 attenuated into a long, cylindrical clavate, proboscidiform appendage ; anteri- 

 orly abruptly narrowed, obtusely truncate or rounded. Proboscis presenting 

 longitudinal and numerous transverse marks. Mouth inferior, at the base of 

 the latter appendage. Intestine straight and capacious. 



Length, 2 to 3 lines ; breadth, l-6ih of a line ; proboscis l-133d in. long, but 

 may lengthen to l-80th in. 



Habitation and Remarks. — A small wriggling worm found among yellowish 

 fragments of vegetable matters and confervas at the bottom of clear brooks in 

 ihe vicinit}' of Philadelphia. Under a very little pressure it undergoes rapid 

 disintegration into globular masses: (cells of the structure distended by en- 

 dosmosis?) 



1. Emea * — Body elongated, plano-convex, soft, proteiform, naked, covered 

 with minute vibrillse. Alimentary canal simple, tortuous, furnished with a 

 gizzard containing a dental apparatus; mouth and anus terminal. Eyes two 

 or three, on each side of the head. 



1. Emea rubra. — Elongated, compressed, contracting irregularly, broadest pos- 

 teriorly, anteriorly obtuse, yellowish flesh colored. Head semi-oval, neck pro- 

 jecting laterally. Eyes, two or three black spots placed in a line behind one 

 another on each side of the head and neck. Mouth simple, opening into a nar- 

 row pharynx ; intestine cylindrical, narrowed posteriorly, furnished with a small, 

 round, muscular stomach, containicg a corneous dental apparatus at its en- 

 trance. Generative apparatus consisting of 2 very tortuous and capacious tubes, 

 !>a93ing the whole length of the body on each side of the alimentary canal. 



Length from 3 to 10 lines ; breadth l-5th to l-3d of a line. 



Habitation and Remarks. — Found in marshes in the vicinity of Philadelphia, 

 creeping upon dead vegetable substances, or upon the ground. When touched 

 or irritated, it secretes a large quantity of very tenacious mucous. Under slight 

 pressure it will voluntary evert more than one-half of the intestinal canal 

 tl^rough the mouth, and upon removal of the pressure, after some minutes, will 

 again withdraw it. and apparently without injury having been sustained, as the 

 animal lives for days afterwards in its usual circumstances. The interior of 

 the body, in the intervals of the viscera, is filled with discoidal corpuscles, as 

 in Xais, etc. The interior of the intestine is every where furnished with nutri- 

 tive villoid appendages. 



2. ANORTHA.f — Body sub-compressed, soft, naked, vibrillated, inarticulate. 

 Alimentary canal simple, straight, alternately contracted and dilated. Mouth, 

 and auus terminal, simple, indistinct. Eyes cone. 



2. Anortha gracilis. — White, opalescent, very contractile, moniliform from 



* I^Mt-or, from the disposition the animal has to protrude or vomit forth the 

 anterior part of the intestine. 

 f atwg6o<r, from the erect position of the animal. 




126 [Dec. 



an alternation of contraction and dilatation, corresponding usually to ten 

 segments, into which the animal may subdivide, but more or less disappearing 

 in elongation of the body, becoming more apparent by wrinkling in shortening 

 of the body; anteriorly semi-ovate, sub-acute; posteriorly elongated, cylin- 

 droid, obtusely rounded. Apparent Fegmenls pnnduriforni, furnished each 

 posteriorly with a clear globular nncleolated nucleus. Intestine variable in 

 capacity, usually dilated in the anterior dihitation of each apparent segment, 

 and much contracted in the intervals. 



Length from 1-2 to 2 lines, shortening to 1 or 1-4 a line; breadth, when 

 elongated, from l-400th to l-300th in.: wlicn shortened from l-300th in. to 

 1-2 of a line. 



Ilubitativn and Jicrnarkn. — P'ound in the same situation as tiie preceding, 

 creeping planaria-like upon different substances, or most frequently holding a 

 vertical position in the water, apparently without movement, but retaining 

 their position by means of the actively moving vibrillae, which are compara- 

 tively larger than in the preceding worms. They appear to feed upon vegeta- 

 ble particles brought to the mouth by means of the currents produced by vi- 

 brillre. The intestine is usually empty, except at the dilated portions, where 

 it is yellowish or greenish, from granular matters contained within. The 

 whole structure of the animal is exceedingly simple, composed of nucleoated, 

 granular corpuscles, those forming the exterior of the body being furnished 

 with vibrillae. Under slight pressure, these corpuscles undergo separation from 

 one another, and become globular by eiidosmosis ; in this state tbey measure 

 from the l-700th in. to the l-2800ih in. The nucleoli aie globular, sh.ning, 

 and measure the l-900th in. in diameter. The exterior vibrillated corpuscles, 

 after separation from the body, often move about for some seconds. The vi- 

 l)rilli« measures about l-3500th in. long. Each segment of the animal's body, 

 at its posterior part, contains a globular, transparent nucleus, measuring the 

 1.2333d in. in diameter, with a globular, retractile nucleolus the l-7000th in. in 

 diameter. This latter body, with the form of the apparent segments, majies 

 the animal resemble a row of gregarinae attached together.

Notice of an American xpecies of Duck, hitherto regarded an identical with the 



Oidemiafutca, {Linn.) 



By Jobx Cassin. 



Oidemia velvetina^ nobis. Audubon, Birds of Am. pi. 247. 



■Form. — ^ Generally similar to that of 0. fu?ca, but is rather larger, bili 

 longer and more slender, with the protuberance at the base of the upper mar- 

 dible more prominent and more extended. Space between the nostril and the 

 edge of the upper mandible much narrower in the present species. 



Upon the protuberance at the base of the bill in this species, the velvet like 

 plumage of the front terminates in a well defined point, as represented in the 

 figure of the female in Aud., pi. 247, while in 0. fusca this termination is ab- 

 ruptly sub-rounded, as in both figures in Selby, 111. pi. 67, though I have never 

 seen a specimen in ■which this rounded character is so distinctly marked as 

 there represented. 




1850] 



127 



Color. — ^ Entirely black, except a spot under the eye and the exposed 

 portion of the secondaries, which are white. The white spot under the eye is 

 larger in the species now described. 



Hab. — Atlantic coast of Norih America. 



Obs. — The two species here alluded to are easily distinguished from each 

 other, when examined together, and both may possibly be found in America 

 and Europe. The pointed extension of the velvity plumage upon the upper 

 mandible is the most ready character by which the species now described may 

 be known. It appears to be the bird figured by both Wilson and Audubon as 

 the Anas fusca, Linn. 



Specimens of both species are in the collection of this Society ; the speci- 

 men which led to their examination was shot at Egg Harbor, N. J., and pre- 

 sented recently by our fellow member, E. J. Lewis, M. D.

REPORT OF TflE LIBRARIAN 

 For the year 1850. 



The additions to the Library, of all descriptions, during the present year 

 amount to 2965, this number being more than double that of 1849, and far ex- 

 ceeding the ratio of any previous year since 1834. Tlie subjoined table has 

 been prepared in the ordinary form, presenting the number of volumes, pam- 

 phlets, and works in parts or numbers, in each subject.

Of the whole number, 2965, there have been contributed by authors 74 ; by 

 ''ditors 1 8 ; by members, correspondents, and others 109; by societies and cor- 

 porations 113; by Dr. Wilson 2493; by Mr. Edward Wilson, of Wales, 153 ; 

 by the U. S. Treasury Department 5 (charts.) ^ 



The extensive contributions of Dr. Wilson to the Library, including those of 

 the present and previous years, are now the property of the Society, on the sole 

 condition that they are not to be loan' d from the Hall. Tue propriety of tbi.i 

 restriction ia unhesitatingly acknow.i.aged by all connected with the iustitu-

tion. It is also in entire accordance with the views of the earlier members of 

 the Society, among them Mr. Machine, who was decidedly in favor of " making 

 the Library a Reading Room, with all possible facilities for those [icrsons who 

 wish to consult llic bucks." I quote from the excellent report of the Library 

 Committee presented in 183G. These facilities are now certainly all that can 

 be desired, and we may even hope that the restriction will be extended by an 

 act of the Society, to all the bookn contained in the Library, no excejiiions be- 

 iig made us at present. 



Among the many valuable additions this year, maybe mentioned the follow- 

 ing : — D'Orbigny's Palteontfdogie Frangaise, nearly complete, from Dr. Morton , 

 Blainville's Osieographie as fur as published ; DemidofiTs Voyage dans la Russie 

 Meridionale ; Paxton's Magazine of Botany, Vols. 1 to 17 ; Memoirs of the Royal 

 Society of Lille, 26 vols. ; Commeutationes Soc. Reg. Sci. Gottingensis. 32 vols. ; 

 Comptes Rendus, vols. 1 to 23, (completing the series in the Library ;) Annalea

 runi, about 80 vols. ; Comiuercium Litterarium, 1 5 vols. ; Transactions of several 

 Berlin Societies, St) vols. ; Annales Acad. Rheno-Trajectinae, 25 vols. ; Meraoires, 

 Annales, Nouv. Annales, et Archives du Museum d'Hist. Nat. de Paris, 21 vols, 

 (completing the Academy's series ;) Commentarii de Rebus, 44 vols. ; Diction-

 the Royal Asiatic Society, vols. 1 to 10; Journal of the Royal Geographical So- 

 ciety, vols. 1 to 19 ; Brewster's Edinburgh Journal of Science, and Brande's do. 

 .^2 vols. ; Diet, classique d'Hist. nat. 17 vols.; Shaw's General Zoology, 14 

 vols.; for all of which we are indebted to the untiring liberality of Dr. Wilson. 

 Mr. Edward Wilson, of Pembrokeshire, Wales, the brother of our esteemed 

 fellow-member, has been a large contributor to the Library during the present 

 sear. He has also been instrumental in creating an interest in the Library 

 with other friends of our institution abroad, and among them a number of nat- 

 uralists and men of science, from whom we have already derived numerous 

 highly acceptable contributions. 



Through exchanges with Societies, we continue to receive considerable ae- 

 eessions to tli£ Journal department. To the '' Ecole des .Mines," of Paris, we 

 hte particulaily indebted this year, for eighteen volumes of thf Journal and 

 Annales des .Mines. Our series of that valuable periodical is now complete, 

 with the exception of three or four volumes. The exchange list, however, is 

 not yet as desirable as we hope it will be, when our relations with foreign sci- 

 rntific bodies are more extemled, and pluced upon a better and more perma- 

 nent footing than at pit sent. 



The extraordinary nipidity with which ilie Library of our favored institution 

 liHS advanced of late years, has astonished and gratified all connectt-d with it. 

 In the last annual report it was stated that, in consequence of its great in- 

 crease it had become necessary to extend the accommodations for books into 

 the adioining room, and that arrangements were then being made for that pur- 

 pose. The alterations were soon afterwards completed, and the apartment has 

 been fitted up in a tasteful and commodious manner. The cases on the floor 

 contain the various transactions, Journals, and similar works, and those on the 

 gallery are entirely occupied with the Dictionaries of Arts and Sciences, and 

 the valuable colleclion of works on Antiquities and the Fine Arts.

The Library has increased from about 7000 volumes ia 1836, to upwards of 

 12,000 volumes in 1850, a period of about fourteen years, nearly all of which 

 have been the gratuitous contributions of individuals or socieHes, very few 

 having been obtained by purchase, or through public sources. The annexed 

 statement shows the number of volumes in each department, ascertained by 

 actual enumeration within the last few days.

Wm. S. Zantzinger, 



Librarian. 



The following report was read by Dr. Leidy, Chairman of the 

 Curators : — 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS 



For 1850. 



Tbe museum of the Academy has continued to increase during theyear just 

 closing with the vigor which characterized it the preceding two years. Several 

 of the departments have received very large accessions ; others, which from their 

 comparative staie of completeness preclude any extensive contributions, have 

 received donations of value and rarity ; and all have had important additions. 



The arrangement of the Cabinet of the Academy devolves upon a few mem- 

 bers, who being able to devote but a portion of their time to the purpose, from 

 the extent of the collection it must be necessarily slow. One of our most im- 

 portant aids in tbis respect we lost last summer : I allude to our much lamented 

 fellow-member and Vice-President, Dr. R E. Griffith, who was steadily engaged, 

 during his moments of leisure, in arranging the conchological collec^tion, to 

 which he had so extensively and liberally contributed. 



The Academy has also been unfortunate this year in the loss of another of its 

 important members. Dr. Gambel, one of our best and most enterprising orni- 

 thologists, who, when at home, frequently leit his valuble assistance in arrang- 

 ing the ornithological collection. 




130 [Dkc. 



All objects of the inuaeuni of a dcBtructible character are in a good state of 

 preservation, and appear to be well protected from the attacks of Dermestes 

 and Plinus by the vapor of ether, which has been lately introduced into use for 

 this purpose by Dr. Wilson. 



The increase in the cabinet during this year, will be briefly noticed under the 

 head of each respective department. 



3lammalia. — In this class the Academy has been greatly enriched by the addi- 

 tion of the collection of Dr. J. K. Townsend, made by himself in the Rocky 

 Mountains and Oregon, consisting of 37 species, 56 specimens, in skin, in a good 

 state of preservation. These were liberally presented to the Society by Dr. 

 Townsend. Most of them are the specimens from which the species were 

 originally described, and many of them are exceedingly rare in natural history 

 collections, and a few are unique.* Among them are two sjiecimens of the 

 gigantic wolf of America, Lupus g iff an ^\Aie.\y described by Dr. Townsend in the 

 Journal of the Academy. 



We have also received skins of twenty species of mammalia,f of Europe. 

 Asia, Africa, and Australia, from W. E. Strickland, Esq., of England, through 

 Dr. Wilson. 



Another addiiion of great value was made by Dr. T. B. Wilson, consisting of 

 one hundred specimens from the collection of the Prince of Canino, C. L. 

 Bonaparte, being the originals of those species figured and described in the 

 Fauna Italica. 



We are also indebted to Capt. W. McMichael for 7 species, 8 specimens, of 

 animals from Van Dieman's Land. 



Besides the above there were presented to the Society ten species from 

 various sources. 



Aves. — We have received during the year 71 bird skins, of which 51 are from 

 Van Dieman's Land, presented by Capt. W. McMichael ; 10 from China, pre- 

 sented by Capt. John Land ; the remainder from various localities, presented 

 by Dr. E. J. Lewis, and others. 



The valuable Des Murs collection of Bird's eggs, containing 1281 species, 

 mentioned in the last report of the Curators as a deposit, has since been pre- 

 sented to the Academy by Dr. Wilson. 



To Mr. Samuel Ashmead we are also indebted for the donation of 38 species, 

 48 specimens of American bird's eggs. 



There were also presented by various individuals, principally members of 

 the Society, 15 species of nests, and 23 of eggs, from different localities. 



ReptUia. — Of reptiles there have been received 65 species, 80 specimens, be- 

 sides numerous American duplicates, principally from Dr. McCartee, of Ningpo, 

 China ; Capt. John Land ; Mr. Sandwith Drinker, of Hong Kong, China ; and 

 Mr. Ashmead. 



Pisces. — In ichthyology the cabinet has received, rather unexpectedly, a large 

 and very valuable collection, presented by Dr. T. B. Wilson, consisting of 767 

 bottles containing fishes in alcohol, and 177 dried specimens of the latter, for- 

 merly belonging to Prince C. L. Bonaparte, and being the originals of the de- 

 scriptions and illustrations of the Fauna Italica.

1850.] 131 



From oihcr parsoni wa hvve received eleven species of fishes, priucipally 

 American. 



MMuscj.. — la tliis department there have been presented 107 species of 

 shells, from various localities, principally by Mr. Ed. Verreaux, of Paris, Dr. 

 MeCartee, of China, and Messrs. E. T. and Chas. W. "Wilson. 



Insecta. — A fine collection of Brazilian insects, consisting of 484 species, 

 931 specimsns, has been added to our cabinet through the liberality of Henry 

 Bond Dewey, Esq., of Para, Brazil, through Dr. Henry Bond, of this city. 



To Dr. MeCartee, also, we are indebted for the gift of 120 species^ 216 

 specimens, of Chinese insects. Other collections have also been received, but 

 without definite njimber, in exchange or by donation, principally from Drs. 

 Heerman, Townsend and Watson. 



The collection of insects of the Academy is arranged in boxes in the form 

 of large quarto volumes, with glass on the two sides, so as to permit the 

 objects to be viewed from above and below without disturbance. The Lepi- 

 doptera now arranged amount to 979 species, 1692 specimens. 



Crustacea, Mt/riapoda and Araehnida. — A large collection of Crustacea has 

 been presented to the Academy by Dr. Wilson, consisting of 381 species, 749 

 specimens, from all parts of the world. 



There have been received, also, nine species from different persons. 

 Ten Spiders and three Myriapods were presented by Dr. MeCartee, of Ningpo. 

 Echinodermata. — Of Echini and star fishes, we have received 21 species, 41 

 specimens, chiefly from Mr. Edward Wilson, and Messrs. Harwick and 

 Argent, of London. 



Comparative Anatomy. — In this department, the additions have been un- 

 usually large and valuable, as follows: 1st. A large series of articulated 

 skeletons of birds, 165 species ; 52 sterna, 10 crania, and 3 other anatomical 

 species of birds, purchased in Paris by Mr. Edward Wilson, and presented by 

 Dr. Wilson ;* 2d. 53 sterna of birds, presented by M. De la Berge ; 3d. 16 

 skeletons of birds, presented by Mr. Goadby, of London ; 4th. 5 skeletons, 3 

 crania and 3 sterna, of birds, from Messrs. Verreaux and Lambert, and Dr. 

 Blanding; 5th. 2 skeletons and 3 crania of mammals, presented by Drs. 

 Blanding and Johnson, and Mr. Shafhirt; 6th. A deposite of 26 human and 

 other mammalian crania, from Dr. Morton. 



Botany. — The herbarium has been increased by the addition of 43 species of 

 Fungi, 46 Musci and Hepatici, 29 Lichenes and 13 Phansrogamia from South 

 Carolina, presented by H. W Ravenel ; a collection of plants from Madeira 

 and the adjoining islands, presented by Purser Henry Etting, U. S. N., through 

 Dr. Hays ; seeds of 150 indigenous plants of New South Wales, presented by 

 the Roj'al Society of Van Dieman's Land ; and 7 other botanical specimens, 

 presented by Mr. Eilvington, Capt. McMichael, Dr. B. H. Coates, and others. 



Palxoniology. — Our Cabinet of organic remains has been much enriched 

 by a collection of 88 specimens of bones of different species of Dinornis and 

 Palapteryx obtained in New Zealand by Walter Mantell, Esq., of.»London, 

 and presented to the Society by Dr. Wilson. Among these relics may be 

 mentioned one of interest, being a complete foot of Dinornis giganteus.

[Dec 



Another collection of great interest, presented te the Academy by Dr. Joel 

 y. Schelly, of Hereford, Berks county, Pennsylvania, consists of 58 fragments 

 of enaliosiuirian bones in a matrix of hard conglomerate, probably belonging 

 to the newer red sandstone formation, found in Hitjier Milford, Lehigh Co., Pa. 



We have also received 255 species, over 300 spccinaens, of fossil shells of 

 different formations, of France, from Mr. Ed. Verrcaux, of Paris, through Or. 

 Wilson. 



Besides the foregoing, a number of other fossils were presented, chitlly by 

 Mr. Joseph Culbertson, of Carlisle, Mr. Ogden, of New Jersey, Mr. Moss and 

 Dr. Budd. 



Mineralogy. — 137 specimens of minerals have been presented, among which 

 may be particularly mentioned a fine series of specimens of native gold from 

 California, presented by Dr. Heerman, and some fine specimens of gold ores 

 from Georgia and Virginia, and cinnabar from California, presented by Dr. 

 J. H. B. McClellan. The others were presented by Mr. Moss Hough, of Sonicr- 

 ville, N. Y., and others. 



Two fine deposites of minerals consist of a specimen of Fluor Spar weigh- 

 ing 23 lbs., from Jefferson county, N. Y., from Mr. Vaux, and a beautiful 

 specimen of native Silver, of Peru, from Dr. Elwyn. 



All of which is respectfully submitted by Joseph Leidy,

January lih, 1851. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Minister of Public Works of France, 

 dated Paris, Sept. 4, 1851, accompanying No. 3, 4th series, of tlie 

 Annales des Mines. 



Also a letter from Mr. George R. Gliddon, dated Philadelphia, 

 Jan. 3, 1851, requesting the loan, for a short time, of the Egyptian 

 Mummy deposited in the Museum of the Academy by Mr. J. L. 

 Hodge. Referred to the Curators. 



Dr. Woodhouse read a communication, intended for publication, 

 entitled " Description of the N. American Jackall, Canis frmtror" 

 Referred to a Committee consisting of Dr. J. C. Fisher, Dr. Town- 

 send, and Dr. Leidy. 



Dr. Leidy read a communication from Mr. Richard C. Taylor, in- 

 tended for publication in the Journal, entitled " Substance of Notes 

 made during a Geological reconnoisauce in the Auriferous Por- 

 phyry region next the Caribbean Sea, in the Province of Veraguas 

 and Isthmus of Panama;" which was referred to the following Com- 

 mittee, viz : — Dr. Elwyn, Dr. Morton, and Mr. Ashmead. 



The Secretary read an extract from a letter addressed to Dr. Mor- 

 ton by Sir John Evans, dated St. Louis, Dec. 19, 1850, in relation to 

 an intended Expedition to Missouri and Oregon. 



The Chairman called attention to the enormous development in 

 the size of the specimen of the common domestic cat presented by 

 him this evening, as the result of emasculation. The following are 

 the dimensions, weight, &c. : 



Length from tip to tip 3 feet ; circumference at middle 19^ inches; 

 weight 42 pounds; color black mixed with white. 



The following Resolution, offered by Dr. Fisher, was adopted : — 

 Resolved, That the President, Vice President, Secretaries and Libra- 

 rian, be a Committee to address the Commissioner of the Land Of- 

 fice at Washington, and solicit an appropriation sufiicient to carry 

 out the views of Dr. John Evans of Missouri, as expressed in his 

 letter read this evening. 



January lAth. 

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Morton referred to some communications which he had re- 

 cently made to the Society, on the races of Dogs, showing their ori- 

 gin from various species of dogs and wolves. He had endeavored to 

 obtain information from persons whose frontier position as officers of 

 the army, &c., afforded them suitable opportunities for this purpose, 

 and read a letter from the Hon. H. H. Sibley, M. C. from Minneso- 

 ta, of which the following is the substance : 



The Indian Dog differs much in size and appearance among difier- 



PROCBED. ACAD. NAT. SCI. OF PHILADELPHIA. VOL. V. XO. VII. 19 




140 [Jan. 



ent trihes. Amonjr the Sioux, it is large and grey, resembling the 

 l^iifliilo Wolt". He sii|)p()S(;s that the Indian dog is crossed with that 

 NNiill. All Iiidiiiiis (logd have .>mall, shar[», erect ears. They cross 

 with our (hiniestii; dogs. He does not believe that the dog crosses 

 with the small wolf ( C. fru.stror ?) or the Fox. The Indian dog is 

 most analogous to the grey wolf, and breeds freely with the Euro- 

 pean dog. 



Dr. ^lorton also read extracts from a letter from Dr. Cooper, of 

 the U. S. Army, dated Fort Duncan, Texas, Dec. 4, 1850. "The 

 Giant Wolf or Lobo, [Lupus gigas] is found in this region. Its color 

 is dark grey, nearly black. It is very fearless of man. I have seen 

 several in the interior of Mexico. It is always solitary in its habits. 

 The small "Wolf or Coyote, [C. frustror] is found in great numbers 

 here. It is never more than eighteen inches or two feet long, nor 

 moretlian fifteen inches high." 



It resembles somewhat a grey fox-hound, and is always in packs 

 of from ten to two or three hundred. It is the most gregarious ani- 

 mal of the dog kind on this continent. Its voice is not like that of 

 the wolf. It feeds on the carcases of dead animals, and is very 

 meagre. It became necessary to destroy one in camp to prevent its 

 crossing with the dogs. Every rancho has a dog resembling the 

 Coyote, and a bitch to which no dog had had access, produced 

 whelps, evidently a cross with the Coyote. 



In further remarks upon this subject. Dr. Morton adverted to the 

 fact that where a race is the result of a cross between two different 

 species of animals, the characteristics of one or the|other race will 

 occasionally be exhibited with peculiar force in generations more or 

 less remote from the origin. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the Society to three fossil bones 

 from Big Bone Lick. Kentucky, belonging to the collection of or- 

 ganic remains of the American Philosophical Society, and now de- 

 posited with the Academy, which he stated were the vertebra den- 

 tata, left os calcis, and the first phalanx of the left hind foot of the 

 Equus Americanus, described by him in the Proceedings several 

 years since. These bones are about the size of the corresponding 

 bones of the largest sized English diay hore. 



Dr. Elwyn asked permission, which was granted, to introduce a 

 letter which he had received from Prof. Shepard, of Charleston, 

 S. C, requesting Dr. Elwyn to procure for him a portion of the 

 Meteorolite found in New Jersey some years since, and presented to 

 the Academy by Dr. McEuen. Prof. Shepard was desirous of 

 making an analysis of this specimen and comparison with other 

 meteorolites in his possession, and offered in return a fragment from 

 one of the latter specimens. 



On motion the subject was referred to the Curators, with instruc- 

 tions to comply with the request of Prof. Shepard. 




1851.] 141 



January 2l6-/. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



The Corresponding Secretary read a letter from J. G. H. Kinberg, 

 dated Malmo and Grouby, 16th December, 1850, announcing that he 

 had forwarded additional objects of Natural History for the Academy, 

 and desiring certain exchanges. 



A communicaiion was read from Joseph P. Hazard, Esq., dated 

 Seaside, near Point Judith, Rhode Island, noticing the arrival of 

 the Kocky Mountain Swallow in that neighborhood, with some ob- 

 servations on its habits. 



" They first made their appearance here in the Spring of 1844, when fourteen 

 pairs of them built on the east and west sides of an outhouse of my residence, 

 and such strangers were they, that I was unable to learn the name of the spe- 

 cies for some time. They have since confined themselves almost exclusively 

 to the same premises, two or three pair only having in a few cases selected 

 other localities in the neighborhood. 



" In the autumn of the same year, (18i4) I built a barn about half a mile 

 distant, on the north side of which I provided for my new friends, in case they 

 should visit me again, a convenient projection of nearly fifty feet in length, 

 suitably protected. In the Spring ensuing, (1845) forty oests were built on 

 the crib which was their first choice above alluded to, and as if for experiment, 

 six nests only were built on the new barn, but in the Spring of 1846, sixty-five 

 nests were built on the barn, and the crib entirely deserted. In 1847, one 

 hundred and thirty pairs built upon the barn and almost completely occupied 

 the space prepared for them. At this time a few pairs which Avere crowded 

 out took up quarters in the martin and blue-bird holes on the south .side of 

 the same building, ousting the rightful tenants which had previously arrived 

 and taken possession. 



" As the location at the barn is much more protected than that on the crib, 

 the nests are there constructed with much less reference to the probability of 

 injury from the weather than formerly upon the latter, a circumstance which 

 evinces a degree of elasticity, I believe not generally accorded to instinct. 



" These swallows make their first appearance here from the 10th to the 15th 

 of May, and commence clearing out the old nests (in which many of the dead 

 of the brood of the previous year are left) about the 1 st of June. The material 

 of which the nests are made, is a very fine sand with a small admixture of 

 blue clay ; when dry it is very friable and the nests suffer considerable dilapi- 

 dation during winter. They generally make their appearance in a mass, but 

 this season four birds only came on the 5th of May, which number received 

 almost daily accessions until the 28th of the same month. Their arrival is 

 earlier, and their departure also, than that of the barn swallow, none remain- 

 ing, I believe, later than about the 1st of September. 



" One circumstance in the habits of these birds has struck me as peculiar : 

 they are either all of them in the vicinity of their nests or all absent, not one 

 to be seen on the premises, and although my observations have not been suf- 




142 Jan. 



ficiently particular to enable me to speak with certainty on this point, I aiu 

 inclineil to believe these intervals of absence are at regular hours of the day- 

 I have seen them two miles distant, in pursuit of insects, which their now large 

 numbers have probably rendered scarce in this more immediate vicinity.'' 



Dr. B. H. Coates read a notice of the antiquity of the use of Tin, 

 mentioning its importation from Britain by the Phoenician.^, and in- 

 ferring from passages cited from Homer that it was regarded at a 

 very early period as a precious nietal. The communication was re- 

 ferred to Mr. Thomas Fisher, ^Ir. Phillips, and Dr. Elwyn. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper, intended for publication in the Proceed- 

 ings, describing some new entozoa. Referred to Dr. Halloweli, Dr. 

 Morton, and ^Ir. H.C Lea. 



January 2Sth. 

 Vice-President. Bridges in the Chair, 



The Committee on Mr. Richard C. Taylor's paper, read Jan. 7th, 

 reported iu favor of Publication in the Journal. 



The Recording Secretary read the following Report for the year 

 1850. 



REPORT 



OF THE RECORDING .SECRETARY 



For 1850. 



It is customary for the RecorJing Secretary to submit his report at the last 

 meeting of the year, but unavoidable absence from home rendered it impossi- 

 ble for me to offer it before this time. 



Nine members and eight correspondents have been elected, and four members 

 have died, to-wit: — the venerable and esteemed Alexander Maclure ; Dr. Wil- 

 liam Gambel, who was not less remarkable for the goodness of his heart than 

 for the cultivation of his mind; our lamented Vice President, Dr. Robert 

 Egelsfeld Griffith, whose amiability and generosity not less than his great 

 acquirements, have rendered his loss severe : and the first elected President of 

 the Institution, Dr. Gerard Troost, who has passed away after a long life de- 

 voted to the pursuit of science. 



By comparing the list of the Society published October 1, 1848, with subse- 

 quent changes, there appear to have been elected up to this time 250 members 

 and 543 correspondents, amounting in all to 793. 



It does not appear that the institution was ever so prosperous. The average 

 attendance at the meetings has been large, and many objects have been zeal- 

 ously pursued. Many communications of great interest have been made, as 

 the publication of the Proceedings and the Journal will establish. 




1851.] 143 



I tru3t that I may be pardoned for suggesting that the prosperity of the 

 Academy might be still farther extended, if the system of introducing strangers 

 to the ordinary meetings were more general. A taste for the pursuit of science 

 might thus be cultivated, and the Society enlarged by some very excellent 

 additions. 



During the year the By-Laws have been amended as follows: Cbapt. 6, Art. 1. 

 There shall be sixteen standing committees, (instead of fifteen, as before the 

 amendment); so that the committee on mineralogy and geology be divided. 



Besides several minor communications, the following have been made during 

 the year. Four by Mr. John Cassin, entitled. Descriptions of new species of 

 birds, specimens of which are in the collection of the Acad. Nat. Sci. of Phila- 

 delphia, (6 species) published in Proceedings ; Descriptions of new species of 

 birds of the genera Paradisea, Pastor, and Buceros, and a proposition to rename 

 others of the genera Alcyone and Hirundo, (5 species described) published in 

 Proceedings ; Descriptions of the new species of Birds collected by Mr. John G. 

 Bell in California, (7 species described) published in Proceedings ; Notice of an 

 American species of Duck hitherto regarded as identical with the Oidemia 

 fusca, (Linn.) published in Proceedings. One by Mr. T. A. Conrad, entitled,

 Proceedings. One by Mr. James Deane, On the Fossil footprints of Connecti- 

 cut River, which was published in the Journal. One by Dr. Lewis B Gibbes,

 remarkable, together with Additions and Observations by the Committee to 

 whom the foregoing was referred, published in the Proceedings. One by S. S. 

 Haldeman, Report on the progress of Entomology in the U. S. One by Mr. A. 

 C. Harris, On the existence of tlie Djis religiosa on the Nile. One by Mr. T. C. 

 Henry, of Albany, on two fishes from Oswego Lake. Twelve by Dr. Joseph 

 Leidy, as follows: — Observations and remarks on Entophyta in living animals 

 and on the theory of generation ; Observations accompanying numerous elab- 

 orate drawings of new entophyta in animals; Remarks on the existence-of crys- 

 tals within animal organic cells ; on eight new Amercan species of Annelida 

 abranchia, (Journal); on new species of Entophyta growing within animals, 3 

 species; describing two new species of Infusorial Entozoa; descriptions of some 

 nematoid Entozoa infesting insects ; observations on two new genera of Mam- 

 malian fossils, EucrotaphusJacksoni, and Archaeotherium Mortoni; descriptions 

 of three Filariae : on the nettling organs of Hydra; descriptions of new genera of 

 Vermes (6) ; on some bones of Rhinoceros nebraskensis, &c., received from the 

 Smithsonian Institute. Three by Dr. Morton, one very full communication (of 

 which parts were made at various times) in continuation of his paper on the size 

 of the brain in the various races of man ; on the value of the word species in 

 Zoology; on the antiquity of some races of dogs. One by Theodore F. Moss, de- 

 scription of a new Carpolitefrom Arkansas. One by Prof. David Dale Owen, and 

 J. G. Norwood, and John Evans, notice of fossil remains brought by Mr. Evans 

 from the Mauvaises Terres or Bad Lands of White River, 150 miles west of the 

 Missouri, published in Journal. One by Prof. David Dale Owen, and B. F. Shu- 

 mard, M. D., description often new species of Crinoideafrom the subcarbonifer- 

 ous limestone oflowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, 1848--9, (Journal). One by Mr. 

 R. C. Taylor, Meteorological table and notes on the climate on the east coast of 




144 [Feb. 



the Istlimiis of Panmna, Port Roval in Jamaica, and on the voyage to New York. 

 One by Dr. J. K. Townsend, describing a new species of American wolf, Lupus 

 gigas, Townsend, of North Anaerica. published in Journal. 



It may not be improper, while enumerating the communications, to direct 

 attention to a letter from Dr. Joel Y. Shelly, acconi'i)anyiDg fossil remains of 

 a supposed saurian found in Upper Milford, Lehigh county, Pennsylvania. 

 Although not personally acquainted with this locality, it is believed to belong 

 to a formation anterior to the coal, and it maybe coeval with the period of the 

 fossil foot prints in red sandstone described by Dr. A. T. King in Proceedings 

 for December 1844, and December, 1845. If this supposition be correct these 

 are probably very old and interesting remains of vertebrate animals and are 

 therefore deserving of attention. 



It seems improper to close a notice of the records, without briefly adverting 

 to the very large portion of them occupied by mere lists of the munificent do- 

 nations received throughout the year. The constant liberality with which so 

 many of the wants of the Academy- are supplied, must be a rich source of grati- 

 tude in the hearts of all its friends, and, while an exquisite and high toned 

 delicacy on the part of a distinguished benefactor forbids me to breathe his 

 name, his generous gifts are appreciated among our richest treasures. All 

 wnich is respectfully submitted by

 S. C, January 20, 1851, presenting his thanks for the fragment of the 




1851.] 145 



New Jersey Meteorolite, and enclosing in return a portion of the 

 Cabarras Meteorolite ; and also stating his intention to make further 

 donations of other meteorolites at an early period. From an examina- 

 tion of the specimen sent him, he had thus far obtained the following 

 results. Sp. gr. 3.25: it also abounds witli nickeliferous iron, together 

 with magnetic iron pyrites, while the greyish-white earthy matter 

 appears to be Howardite. (Fe Si -f- Mg Si.) 



A letter was read from the Scandinavian Scientific Association 

 (without date,) accompanying the donation of a copy of its Proceed- 

 ings during the last meeting at Copenhagen. 



A letter was read from H. B. Dewey, Esq., dated Para, Brazil, 

 Dec. 28, 1850, tendering his thanks for his election as a Correspond- 

 ing member of the Academy, and expressing his desire to still further 

 promote the objects of the Institution. 



A communication addressed by Peter A. Browne, Esq., to Dr. 

 Morton was read, briefly enumerating the discoveries he had made 

 by means of the microscope, micrometer, and trichometer,* in regard 

 io j)ile, by which term he meant to include both hair and wool, as 

 follows : 



1st. I have found the hair of the head of man of three principal shapes, viz. : 

 1. The cylindrical ; 2. The oval ; and 3. The eccentrically elliptical. 



Of the 1st I have noticed the ancient hairs from Peru, Mexico, Brazil, &c., 

 those of our present Indians and the Chinese. Of the second, the hairs of the 

 English, French, Hungarians, Germans and Americans, &c., &c. And of the 

 third the wool of the Bushman and African negro. 



2d. The pile of the 1st and second class comes out of the epidermis at an 

 acute angle, that of the third at a right angle. 



3d. The pile of the 1st class is straight and lank, that of the 2d is flowing or 

 curling, and that of the 3rd is crisp or frizzled, andsometimes spirally curled. 



4th. The pile of the 2d class has its coloring matter in a central canal, but 

 I have never been able to detect any central canal in either of the other classes ; 

 their coloring matter appears to me to be disseminated in the cortex and in- 

 termediate fibres. 



5th. The cortex of the pile of all three classes is squamose ; but the scales 

 on the 1st and 2d classes are less numerous, are rounded at the anterior ex- 

 tremity, and adhere closely to the shaft ; but those of the 3d class are more 

 numerous, pointed, and not so closely set to the shaft. 



.6th. That there are two distinct species of sheep, as determined by their 

 pile, viz. — the hairy sheep, and the woolly sheep. The pile of the hairy sheep 

 will not felt nor full ; the wool of the woolly sheep will do both. 



7th. Upon the heads of the hybrids formed by the crossing of any two of 

 the species of man above mentioned, are found separate filaments belonging to 

 their two classes respectively ; and upon the head of a double hybrid, f which 

 I examined, I found filaments belonging respectively to all three classes. 



*An instrument invented by Mr. Brown for determining the ductility, elas- 

 ticity, and tenacity of filaments. 



f One who had the blood of all three classes. 




146 [Feb. 



9th. All Imir is not polaric. 



loth. There are various dejijrecs of the felting property in wool, which may 

 be determined by the aid of the microscope, as they depend upon the number, 

 shape and adherence of the scales. 



11th. The sofiness of any woolly fabric, is in exact proportion to the ductili/t/ 

 and elasticity of the filaments of which it is composed ; and the ductility and 

 elasticity of the fibre can be accurately determined by the xrichometer. 



12th. The method in common use of determining the diameter of any filament 

 that is not cylindrical is inaccurate, for every filament that is not cylindrical 

 has two diameters, which cannot be accurately determined, excej)t by using 

 transverse sections. 



13th. That in all cases of doubt or difficulty, whether a filament is or is not 

 a true hair, it can be determined with the trichometer. 



14th. The button of the pile of the head of man changes its shape and color 

 in diseases of the hair, and in diseases of the skin that affect the hair. 



15th. The buttons of the pile of the head of lunatics differ from those of the 

 sane. 



IGth. There is no difference between the wool found upon the head of a pure 

 negro, and that found upon the back of a woolly sheep, except in the decree of 

 the felting power possessed by them. 



Dr. Morton, in remarking upon the cranium of the Dijak deposited 

 by him this evening, referred to thegreat difficulty in obtaining these 

 crania, and stated that Mr. "Wm. CTJiddon, from whom he had derived 

 the present specimen, had beeu unal)le, during many years residence 

 in Borneo, to induce the natives to part with any of their trophy 

 skulls upon any consideration. This had been carried off by a 

 Dutch officer on a warlike expedition. 



Dr. Morton announced the decease of Mr. John J. Audubon, a 

 member of this Society ; and after some appropriate observations 

 upon the life and character of this distinguished zoologist, moved 

 the following Kesolutions, which were unanimously adopted : — 



Rtsoh'fd, That this Society has heard with profound regret of the 

 death of their esteemed and venerable colleague, John James Audu- 

 bon, at his residence near the city of Xew York, on the 27th ultimo. 



Resolved, That by the demise of this truly great man. Science has 

 lost one of her most zealous and gifted disciples, and the Arts, a 

 master in the branch which he cultivated. 



Resolved, That we recognize in Mr. Audubon a man who has hap- 

 pily lived to ful61 his destiny as an explorer of the great field of 

 American Zoology, while the splendid volumes which are the fruit 

 of his labors, will diffuse the knowledge and the love of science to 

 the latest generations. 



Rej^olved, That a copy of these Resolutions, signed by the officers, 

 together with the sympathy of the members of this Society, be re- 

 spectfully tendered to the family of Mr. Audubon. 



On leave granted, the Committee, to whom was referred the paper 




1851.] 147 



of Dr. Woodhouse, read January 7th, 1851, describing anew species 

 of Jackal, presented a report, recommending the same for publica- 

 tion in the Proceedings and Journal, with some additional remarks 

 on the subject by the Chairman, Dr. J. C. Fisher, which was adopted. 



The North American Jackal — Cams Frustrok. 

 By S. W. Woodhouse, At. D. 



Char. Essent. — Hair cinereous grey, varied with black above. Longer on the 

 vertebral line, legs fulvous. 



Dimensions. — Total length from the tip of the nose including the tail, with the 

 exception of the hair at the tip, two feet seven inches ; trunk of the tail eight 

 and three-tenths inches; total length of ears four and three-tenths inches • 

 length of fore leg nine inches ; from the anterior canlhus of the eye to the tip 

 of the nose two and seven-tenths inches; from the anterior angle of ear to 

 posterior canthus of the eye two and four-tenths inches ; between the anterior 

 angles of the ears two and five-tenths inches. 



Description. — Hair at base fulvous and woolly, middle of its length white and 

 tipped with black; ears erect, pointed at tip, cinnamon color behind and at 

 the base ; inside dirty white, sides paler than the back, belly brownish white 

 breast brown, chin white, legs cinnamon color; the nose from the eyes to the 

 tip cinnamon color. Cheeks grey ; space between the ears reddish brown • 

 tail fulvous below, dark grey above, black at tip, slightlj^ bushy; iris light 

 brown, lips white tipped with black ; it has tbree series of setaj on the upper 

 lip, above the eyes, and on the sides of the cheeks. 



The most remarkable difference exists in the skull of this animal, which 

 more closely resembles the Jackal of the Old World than any known species of 

 wolf. But as Dr. Morton is now engaged on a memoir in which the cranial 

 characteristics of the American wolves will be compared with those of the 

 Canis lupus of Europe, I leave this part of the subject in his hands. 



Habits. — This animal I first saw at Fort Gibson, on the Neosho river. They 

 frequent this place at night in numbers, making their way to a ditch where the 

 offals of the garrison are thrown. Their bark is sharp like that of a terrier, 

 followed in quick succession, then a prolonged cry much like that of the hound. 



Four or five of them make as much noise as twice their number of terrier 

 dogs, so that a stranger on hearing them is apt to be deceived as to their num- 

 ber. I have seen them on all parts of the prairie, but they appear to be more 

 abundant near the settlements. 



■ They prowled frequently about our camp at night, keeping up an incessant 

 barking. 



I procured a male and female ; these I regret to say have not lost their milk 

 teeth, but they have attained their full growth, as I have seen numbers of them. 



On showing them to Dr. Townsend, he recognized them immediately, and 

 said that he had seen them frequently on the plains of the Missouri, b_;it never 

 beyond the mountains. 



This animal has hitherto been confounded with the Canis latrans of Say. 



Observationt by the Committee. 

 The Committee are much gratified with this paper, as it assists in throwing 




148 [Feb. 



light upon apoiat in the Natural History of tlie wolves of North America, which 

 has heretofore been involved in obscurity, Before the (lescription of the Lupus 

 Gigas of North America, by Dr. Townsend, all the varieties of wolves in this 

 country were referred by naturalists to two species, the Lupus occidcntalis or 

 common wolf, and the Lupus lalrans, or prairie wolf. Sir John Richardson 

 was the first who unequivocally described the wolves of North America, as 

 distinct from the European or Pyrenean wolf. The great majority of natural- 

 ists who have noticed the wolves of this continent, including Grey, Agassiz, 

 De Kay, &c., agree with him in considering them as entirely distinct .siiecies 

 from the wolves of the Eastern Continent.* With the exception of the '• large 

 brown wolf," of Lewis and Clarke, they all refer the American wolves of every 

 variety to the two species named Lupus occidentalis, and Lupus latrans. It 

 was scarcely possible to reconcile the various descriptions of the different 

 wolves classed under the last of these, Lupus latrans, as belonging to the same 

 animal. The Lupus latrans of Say, found on the Upper Missouri and the Sas- 

 kechawan, is classed by Richardsonf with the Oalifornian Ochropus, and the 

 Mexican nigrirostii, (known also as the (.'oj-ote.) He has given a figure of the 

 Lupus latrans, which agrees exactly with a specimen in the possession of th« 

 Academy. 



The figure given by Audubon in his Quadrupeds of North America, Plate 71st, 

 does not agree with Richardson's, or with the specimen above referred to, but 

 does agree very closely with the Canis frustror, in color, shape, &c. It is an 

 excellent drawing of the last mentioned animal. The Coyote of Mexico and 

 California, has been, we believe, uniformly referred by naturalists to the Lupus 

 latrans, and the drawing of Audubon appears to have been made from it, con- 

 sidered as an undoubted Prairie wolf. The figure of the Hare Indian dog of 

 Richardson, the Canis familiaris lagopus, bears a very striking resemblance to 

 the Lupus latrans of Audubon, and the Canis frustror of Woodhouse. We are 

 inclined from the figure, measurements, and description of the voice, to con- 

 sider this dog as the analogue among our domestic animals of the Canis frus- 

 tror or Coyote, if it be not the same animal merely domesticated. From the 

 Canis frustror hunting so uniformly iu packs of considerable numbers, as well 

 as its size, it is more nearly allied to the Jackal than the wolf. It is decidedly 

 gregarious in its habits. We hope that the Academy will soon possess good 

 specimens of all the wolves of this continent, so that a more strict comparison 

 may be made, and this question of species be definitely settled. At present 

 we may consider the following species as clearly established, viz : Lupus gigas. 

 Lupus occidentalis, Lupus latrans, and Canis frustror. 



On leave granted Mr. Vaux, as Treasurer of the Publication Com- 

 mittee, presented the Annual Report, which was adopted. 



February Wth. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 

 A letter was read from Dr. N. S. Jarvis, addressed to Dr. Morton,

Dr. Morton on the subject of the Lobos, Coyote and Indian dogs. 

 This letter was received by Dr. Morton on the 5th inst., and enclosed 

 another in the French language from Dr. Louis Berlandier to Dr. 

 Jarvis, dated Mataraoras, Jan. 5th, 1851, with accompanying de- 

 scriptions of several species of Canis indigenous to Mexico. Dr. Ber- 

 landier's knowledge and means of information on this subject had 

 been very extensive, and his descriptions were well worthy the notice 

 of the Society. His letter and descriptions were on motion referred 

 to the Committee who had charge of Dr. Woodhouse's paper, viz., 

 Dr. J. C Fisher, Dr. Leidy, and Dr. INIorton. 



Mr. Cassin stated, on behalf of the committee having in charge 

 Dr. T. C. Henry's paper describing a new species of Fish from Oswe- 

 go Lake, N. Y., that a more extended communication had been re- 

 ceived from the author by the Connnittee. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper intended for publication in the Proceed- 

 ings entitled, "Sketch of the Birds composing the green Vireo Vieill. 

 and Vireosylvia, Bonap." &c. Referred to Dr. Wilson, Dr. Bridges, 

 and Mr. E. Harris. 



February 18th. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



]Mr. Cassin read a paper describing new species of the green Bucco 

 and Galbula, Briss. Referred to the committee on the paper by Mr 

 Cassin read at last meeting. 



A letter was read from the Secretary of the Asiatic Society of 

 Bengal, dated Aug. 5, 1850, acknowledging the receipt of Part 3, 

 Vol. 1, New Series of the Journal. 



February 2dth. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



The Committee on Mr. Cassin's papers, read 1th and 18th insts., 

 reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings.

Obs. — It appears npon the authority of Wilson that this is the Muscicapa can- 

 tatrix, Bartram. That name, even if it had priority, is not entitled to adoption, 

 not being accompanied by any description whatever. The name alluded to is 

 given with many others, in " Travels through North and South Carolina, 

 Georgia, East and West P^Iorida,"' &c., by William Bartram, Philadelphia, 1791 , 

 (octavo, 1 vol.,) p. 291. According to my views the authority for M. cantatrix 

 should be Wilson, he having first defined the species, though very probably 

 upon the designation of the celebrated Bartram himself. I do not mean to say, 

 however, that none of the names of the latter ought to be adopted, for there 

 a few of the species named by him, to which are attached sufficient descrip- 

 tions, and which I hope to designate in an early paper. 



4. Vireo Bellii. Aud. B. of Am. Octavo edition, vii, p. 333, pi. 485, (1844.) 

 Dimensions. — ^ Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 4 G-lOths 



inches, wings 2 3-lOths, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. — ^ Under mandible, viewed from below, yellowish Avhite, superior 

 mandible light brown. Shafts of the quills on the inferior surface of the wing, 

 white. Entire plumage above light olive tinged with greyish brown on the head, 

 wings and tail brown, the feathers of both of which are edged externally with 

 pale yellowish green, quills with their inner webs narrowly edged with yel- 

 lowish white. Greater and lesser wing coverts conspicuously tinged with the 

 same color. Plumage of the entire under parts of the body pale yellowish 

 white, running into pure yellow on the sides and inferior tail coverts. Nares 

 and ring around the eye yellowish white. Tarsi and feet dark. 



9. Slightly smaller, colors paler, head inclining to cinereous, under parts 

 nearly white. 



Ilab. — Western side of North America. 



Obs. — The smallest of the birds of this genus. It was discovered by Mr. 

 Audubon on the Upper Missouri river, during the last expedition accomplished 

 by him, and has since been found in California by Mr. John G. Bell, after 

 whom it is named. The descriptions above are from the specimens of the latter 

 gentleman and from the originals of Mr. Audubon, which were presented to 

 the Academy by his friend and associate Mr. Edward Harris.

Dimensions. — ^ Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 4 9-lOthg 

 inches, wing 2 4-10th8, tail 2 inches. 



Colors. — ^ . Under mandible viewed from below, dark horn color, superior 

 mandible nearly black. Shafts of quills on the inferior surface of the wing 

 dark brown. Entire plumage above light olive green, inclining to yellowish on 

 the rump and upper tail coverts. Greater and lesser wing coverts broadly 

 tipped with white, appearing to form two conspicuous bars on the wing ; 

 quills brown externally, narrowly edged with yellowish green, and internally 

 edged with white, conspicuous when viewed from below. Plumage of the en- 

 tire under parts greenish cream color, (very delicate and peculiar,) inclining 

 to yellowish. on the flanks. Xares and ring around the eyes yellowish white. 

 Tarsi and feet dark. '' Iris dark hazel, feet blue.' 



^. Slightly smaller, very similar in color to the male. 



Hab. — Monterey, California, (Mr. W. Hutton.) Georgetown, California, 

 (Mr. J. G. Bell.) 



Obs. — This species of Vireo may be recognized without difficulty by the very 

 delicate cream color of the entire under surface of its body, which color I 

 have never seen in any other bird. la other respects it somewhat resembles 

 Vireo Bellii, though it appears to be a stouter and more robust bird ; the only 

 specimen m the collection of the Academy is that of Mr. Bell ; there are two 

 others in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, to which they were 

 presented with many other birds, by Mr. Wm. Hutton, a zealous and talented 

 young naturalist now resident at San Diego, in California, in honor of whom 

 I have taken the liberty of naming it. 



Mr. Bell's remarks on this species are as follows : " I shot this bird at 

 Georgetown, October 15th, 1849. My attention was attracted to it by its song, 

 which somewhat resembled that of the warbling Viero, ( V. gilvus,) though the 

 difference could easily be detected. It was in a very high pine tree, and the 

 only specimen that I ever saw or heard. The country was hilly, and covered 

 with a few oaks. This bird was a male."

 its wings are shorter and its plumage is of more vivid green. The under parts 

 of the body are tinged with yellow, especially the inferior tail coverts, much 

 more than in V. olivaceus. It appears to be a common bird in South America, and 

 I have seen specimens said to be from Trinidad. The best descriptions extant of

Hub. — Florida, West Indies, and South America. 



0(/s. — A species also consideraby resembling V. olivacea, but larger and with 

 the bill distinctly longer. It is easily distinguished by the narrow black lines 

 running downwards from the corners of the lower mandible. 



This is the largest of all the species yet discovered, and was first obtained 

 within the present limits of the United States, by Dr. A. L. Heermann, in 

 Florida. It is probably the bird alluded to by .Mr. Gosse, in his delightful vol- 

 ume on the Birds of Jamaica, though I can only judge by the measurements 

 given by him, which are too large for V, olivaceus. Mr. Gosse appears though 

 to have had access to the plate of Audubon and possibly that of Wilson. He 

 gives no detailed description. Nuttall, in Manuel i.,p. 360, (1840,) says " the 

 V. olivaceus has never yet been found in those Islands," (the West Indies,) but 

 it does not api)ear to me to be im])ossible at all that it mav be, as Audubon 

 met with it in Florida and Louisiana. (Orn. Biog. II., p. 288. 



4. Vireosyluia Jlavoviridis, nobis. Buff. PI. Enl. 538, fig. 2? 



Form. — Generally resembling that of V. altiloqua, but is rather smaller, the 

 wings and legs are shorter, and the latter much less robust, the bill is also 

 slightly more slender. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 5J inches, 

 wing 3 and 2-lOths, tail 2 and 2-lOths inches. 



Colors. Head above pale cinereous, superciliary stripes pale ashy-white, 

 not so distinctly defined as in V. allilogua. Entire plumage of the body above 

 fine yellowish olive, wings and tail brown with their feathers widely margined 

 externally with the same yellowish olive and internally with j'cllowish white. 

 Sides of the neck and of the body beneath, inferior wing and inferior tail 

 coverts fine greenish yellow, middle of the body beneath from the base of the 

 bill to the abdomen pure white. Upper mandible lead color, lower white. No 

 black lines from the base of the lower mandible, and general color of the body 

 above much more vivid than in V. altiloqua. Irides red. 



5 Rather smaller and colors paler. 



Ilab. Panama, where it was obtained by Mr. John G. Bell, and San Juan 

 de Nicaragua, from whence it was sent to this Academy by Mr. A. de Barruel. 



Obs. This is a very handsome species, much more brightly colored, and 

 without the black lines on the front of the neck which characterize the V. 

 altiloqua. Four specimens are in the collection of the Academy. 



Mr. Bell represents this bird as having been rather common near Panama in 

 May, 1849, and that in habits and song it much resembled the red-eye, ( V. 

 olivacea. )

Colors. Line over the eye pale greenish white, very distinct. Entire upper 

 parts olive green, inclining to ash on the head, quills and tail feathers brown, 

 narrowly edged with green. Under parts pale yellowish white, shading into 

 greenish upon the sides. Nares dark, bill horn color. 



Hab. Near Philadelphia. 



Obs. This small species resembles V. gilva more than it does any other 

 species, but is smaller and can at once be distinguished by its much shorter 

 and weak bill. Its colors are more vivid and the superciliary line more distinct. 



I shot the bird now described in Bingham's woods near Philadelphia in Sep- 

 tember, 1842, but have never seen another specimen. It was in the upper 

 branches of a tree of considerable heighth, engaged in capturing insects, and 

 attracted my attention by its slow and apparently deliberate movements. 



III. Notice of species which I'have not seen, and general observations. 



1. Vireo versicolor. Hartlaub. Revue Zoologique, 1843, p. 289. 



Orig. descrip. " Supra olivaceo-viridis, pileo toto nuchaque nigricante-plum- 

 beis ; plumulis ciliaribus dilute flavis, tectricibus ala majoribus rufis ; remigibus 

 primariis angustissime, secundariis latins rufo marginatis, tertiariis pogouio 

 externo pallide fulvis ; flexura alte flavo et olivaceo variegata ; subtus flavus, 

 gula collo antico pectoreque fasciolis multisinterruptis et irregularibusoliva- 

 ceis transversim variegatis ; cauda nigricante, rostro obscure plumbeo ; man- 

 dibulae tomiis apiceque albidis, pedibus nigris. Long. 4|. La plus petite 

 espece du genre." 



Above olive green, with the head above and nape blackish lead color, ciliary 

 feathers pale yellow, greater wing coverts rufous, primaries very narrowly, 

 secondaries more broadly margined with rufous, tertiaries with their external 

 webs pale fulvous, flexure of the wing variegated with yellow and olive ; be- 

 neath yellow, throat, neck before and breast with many interrupted and irreg- 

 ular transverse little lines of olive, tail blackish, bill obscure lead color, edges 

 of the mandibles and apex w hite, feet black. Length about 5 inches, (4| inches 

 French.) The smallest species of the genus. 



Obs. This bird must be quite different in general appearance from any other 

 of either of the genera Vireo or Vireosylvia. Its rufous wing coverts and 

 broad margins of the secondaries, also rufous, are quite peculiar. 



M. Hartlaub is mistaken about this being the smallest of the genus. There 

 are at least three species which are smaller.

2. Vireo Vifforsii, (Aud.) Richardson, Report on N. A. Zoology to Brit. 

 Assoc, for the Adv. of Science, (in Sixth Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1837, p. 172.) 



Sylvia Vigorsii. Aud. Orn. Biog. 1 p. 15.3, pi. 30. 



Obs. Audubon's figure has a Vireo-like look, and ought to be remembered. 

 In his Synopsis, p. 55, he places this name as a synonyine for Sylvicola pinus, 

 (Lath.) 



3. Vireosylva is the orthography of M. Bonaparte in Geog. and Conip. List. 

 p. 26, but in Conspectus Avium, p. 329, he makes it Vireosi/lvia, the former 

 being apparently a typographical error. It is a very natural and easily defined 

 genus, and was first pointed out by this deservedly celebrated naturalist in the 

 edition of the work cited which was published in 1838. In Ericlison's Archiv, 

 xui. p. 321, (1847,) Mr. Cabanis unnecessarily proposes the name Fhyliomanes 

 as a substitute. 



Descriptions of new species of birds of the genera Galbula and Bucco, Brixs., speci- 

 mens of which are in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia. 



By Johm Cassi.v. 



1. Galbula cyanicollis, nobis. 



Form. Not essentially different from that of other short-tailed species. 

 Rather stout, space from the bill around the eye bare and conspicuous, middle 

 tail feathers but slightly longest. 



Bimfnsions. Total length of skin from top of bill to end of tail 7 J inches, 

 wing 3 and 1-lOth, tail 3 inches. 



Colours. Head above blue with golden olive reflections, the same color, blue, 

 extends from the base of the bill upon the neck beneath the bare space around 

 the eye, bordering (upon the neck only) the deep reddish brown of the entire 

 under surface of the body. Entire plumage above and two middle tail feathers 

 golden-green, very brilliant, and inclining to red in some lights. Outer tail 

 feathers reddish brown, slightly edged externally with golden-green, quills 

 black, primaries narrowly and secondaries broadly edged on their inner webs 

 with brown, rather paler than that of the body beneath. A trace of a green 

 collar on the neck in front. 



Tip of upper mandible black, basal portion of upper, whole of under mandible 

 (space around the eye and feet?) yellow. 



Uab. Para, Brazil. 



Obs. This species is related to G. chalcocephala, Deville, and G. albirostris, 

 Lath. I am acquainted with no other species in which the head and neck are 

 blue as above described. Several specimens are in the collection, all of which 

 are from Para. 



2. Bucco Ordii, nobis. 



Fonn. Generally short and robust, feathers of the head but little elongated, 

 wings and tail short. A strict congener of B. macrorhynchus and pectoralis. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail 7| inches, 

 wing 3 and 3-10th3, tail 2 and 8-lOth inches. 



Colors. Tail with a central transverse white bar. Breast with a narrow band 

 of black, immediately succeeded by another much wider of dark chesnut-brown,

throat and abdomen white, which is the color also of the frontal feathers of 

 the internal webs of the primaries at their bases, and of a narrow collar on the 

 back of the neck. Entire superior surface of the head, body, wings, and tail 

 black, with a greenish gloss. Tail with a band of white most observable on 

 the inner webs of the feathers, and narrowly edged with white at its end. 

 Flanks striped with the same dark brown as the broader belt of the breast. 



Hab. Venezuela. 



Obs. A bird resembling generally the several species of whieh Bucco macro- 

 rhynchus, Gm., is a representative, but immediately recognizable by the white 

 bar in its tail and its smaller size. I have seen onlj- the specimen now described. 



I have taken the liberty of naming this bird as a trifling tribute of respect 

 to Mr. George Ord of this city, the Xestor of American naturalists, the early 

 and constant friend and biographer of the great Alexander Wilson. 



The Committee on Dr. Leidy's new species of Entozoa, reported

The Committee, to whom the paper of Dr. Berlandier, read to the 

 Academy Feb. 11th, 1851, describing two species of Mexican 

 wolves, was referred, reported : 



That after a careful examination, they are satisfied that the first, the Canis 

 Mexicanus of Desmarest, No. 297, and the Lupus Mexicanus of Col, Hamilton 

 Smith, Vol. 9th, Mammalia Nat. Lib., though heretofore considered by Richard- 

 sou and others as a variety of the common wolf, Lupus occidentalis, is yet, from 

 its peculiarly marked form, entitled to be considered a distinct species. As this 

 wolf has been described and figured in the work referred to, it would only be 

 unnecessarily multiplying its synonyms to publish a new name for it, unless 

 stronger reasons be given than exist in the present case. The second is unques- 

 tionably the one described by Dr. Woodhouse, under the name of Canis frustror, 

 in a paper read to the Academy, Jan. 7th, 1851, and directed to be published in 

 the Proceedings and in the Journal of the Academy. The same objection, the 

 unnecessary multiplication of synonyms, also applies to the publication of the 

 name given by Dr. Berlandier to this wolf. Although Dr. Woodhouse is entitled 

 by priority of publication to the right of giving the specific name, yet the Com- 

 mittee feel unwilling to report against the publication of this part of the paper, 

 especially as it strongly corroborates the views expressed by them in the remarks 

 made on the Canis frustror. Considering the description of the first also as im- 




1851.] 157 



portant in establishing the claim of the Lupus Mexicanus to be ranked as a dis- 

 tinct species, and not as a variety, the Committee would recommend the publi- 

 cation of the translation of the paper of Dr. Bei'landier, omitting the specific names 

 given by him, in the Proceedings of the Academy. 



Canis Mexicanus, Desm. 297. 



Head elongated, reddish-grey, with a blackish band upon the forehead, not 

 distinctly defined ; ears reddish, a little darker upon the anterior margin ; back 

 mixture of ashy-grey ; dirty red and blackish bands, which extend a little upon 

 the flanks ; a mane; abdomen dirty light-red ; tail reddish, black above, very 

 much tufted, and terminated by black hairs, not pendulous. 



It inhabits almost the whole of Mexico, and is common in desert localities, 

 particularly in the shore regions of the gulf of Mexico. It is found also upon 

 the central plateau. 



It is as susceptible of being tamed as a dog ; (those which I have raised were 

 very good as watch dogs) it lives on good terms with the domestic animals. 

 It howls principally at night when the weather is about to change. This wolf 

 is celebrated for his cunning, his vivacity and his habits. All the inhabitants 

 bestow upon him in a high degree these first qualities. 



Total length from the end of the nose to the extremity of the tail, 4 feet 6 

 inches French. Height at the shoulder 1 foot 5 inches. 



Canis prusteor, Woodhouse. 



Size of the common fox, (Canis vulpes) or a little larger ; reddish-grey ; a 

 blackish-grey mane along the back, shaded with black upon the shoulders ; ears 

 cinnamon-red; anterior feet red, in front blackish; extremity of the tail blackish. 



Inhabits all the plains, more or less wooded, of Tamaulipas, New-Leon, 

 Coahuila, and of Texas ; is again found in greater or less abundance through - 

 out the whole of Mexico, and perhaps also in the greater part of North America. 



It is susceptible of being tamed, but preserves a distrustful character. It 

 does not howl like the wolf, and its cry is rather a yelping bark, which is 

 heard in the evening and also early in the morning. 



Total length from the end of the nose to the extremity of the tail 3 feet 4 

 inches French. Height of the shoulder 1 foot 1 inch. 



Mammal very cowardly, but also perhaps the most cunning. 



The Corresponding Secretary read his Monthly Report, which was 



adopted. 



The Auditors reported that they had examined the Keport of the 

 Treasurer for 1850, and had found it correct. 



ELECTIONS. 



The following were elected Correspondents of the Academy. Mr. 

 W.Haidinger, President of the Imperial Geological Society at Vien- 

 na ; Baron Von Hauer, of Vienna ; Pref. Joseph Hyrtl, of Vienna ; 

 Dr. C. M. Deising, of Vienna ; and Mr. Charles Girard, of "Wash-

March ith, 1851. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair. 



Letters were read from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 

 dated Washington, July 3d, 1851, and from the Librarian of the 

 British Museum, dated Jan. 18th, 1851. severally acknowledging the 

 receipt of late Nos. of the proceedings of the Academy. 



Also a letter from the Asiatic Society of Bengal, dated June 7th, 

 1850, acknowledging the receipt of Part 4, Yol. 1, new series of the 

 Journal. 



Dr. Morton offered some remarks on the Dijak and other crania 

 deposited by him this evening. 



Mr. Cassia offered the following, which were unanimously agreed 

 to:— 



Whereas, This Society has recently sustained the loss of a distin- 

 guished and valued member, Dr. John K. Townsend, late of this city, 



Resolved, That the acquirements of the late Dr. Townsend, and his 

 zeal and enterprise as a scientific traveller, entitle him, in the opinion 

 of this Society, to a high rank as a naturalist and explorer of the 

 natural history of this country. 



Resolved, That this Society hereby acknowledges with cheerfulness 

 and gratitude its obligations to Dr. Townsend for many interesting and 

 important contributions to its collections, especially of the Birds and 

 Quadrupeds of Western America, and his valuable papers relative 

 thereto published. 



Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be communicated to the 

 family of our deceased fellow member. 



March 11th. 



Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Corresponding Secretary of the Historical 

 Society of Pennsylvania, dated March 10, 1851, transmitting a resolu- 

 tion, which had been adopted by that Society, to request of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences the deposit in their Library of the copy of the Paris 

 " Moniteur'' belonging to the Academy. Referred to the Library 

 Committee. 



March ISth. 

 Dr. Morton, President, in the Chair, 



A circular was read, dated March 14th, 1851, from the Executors 

 of the late Mrs. Elizabeth Stott, informing the Legatees that they were 

 now prepared to discharge the payment of the legacies as soon as they 

 were furnished with the refundiner bonds. On motion, theref(Jre, 



Resolved, That the Treasurer, Geo. W. Carpenter, be authorized to

receive from the Executors of the late Mrs. Stott the amount of her 

 legacy to this lustitution, and to execute the necessary bonds on pay- 

 ment of the same. 



Ajiril 1*7. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Morton read a letter addres.sed to him, from Dr. Alfred T. King, 

 dated Greensburg, Pa., March 17, 1851, on the subject of the anatomy 

 and functions of the brain in the inferior animals. 



Dr. Morton, referring to the crania dtposited by him this evening, 

 stated that the cranium of the mummy recently dissected by Mr. Glid- 

 don was that of a female, and an Egyptian in every respect. An at- 

 tempt had been made to preserve all the bones, but upon some of them 

 having been wetted, they were entirely converted into a clay-like 

 mass; the cranium had, however, escaped. One of the Tapajos In- 

 dian crania was curiously embalmed, in a manner peculiar to these 

 people, who place several together in jars : the eyes are singularly 

 represented, and the skull presents the peculiar roundness of the pos- 

 terior portion which is common to this race. The cranium of the 

 Guayacuru (a young female) was interesting from the great rarity of 

 these crania,' 



The following, offered by Dr. Elwyn, was adopted : — 

 Whereas, Mr. George Ord has kindly consented, at the request of 

 members of the Academy, to place at its disposal a portrait of himself 

 now in his possession : 



Resolved., That the Recording Secretary be directed to correspond 

 with Mr. Ord on the subject, and to fiiguify to him the gratification it 

 would afford the Society to receive the portrait. 



April Sth. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy exhibited three fragments of the inferior maxilla of a gigan- 

 tic species of Palaeotherium, to which in the last number of the Pro- 

 ceedings he had given the name P. Proutii, in honor of Dr. Hiram A. 

 Prout, of St. Louis. By the latter gentleman they had been obligingly 

 lent to him through Prof. Baird of the Smithsonian Institution. One of 

 them had been described by Dr. Prout in Silliman's Journal, the others 

 had been since obtained. Two of the fragments apparently belonged to 

 the same individual, viz : that described by Dr. Prout being a portion of 

 the left ramus, containing the s eventh molar tooth nearly entire and 

 the preceding teeth much mutilated ; and a part of the right ramus ex- 

 tending back to the ^ngle containing three posterior molars mutilated. 

 They correspond closely in appearance, age, and size. The third frag- 

 ment is a much mutilated posterior molar of the right side, rather larger 

 than the corresponding tooth of the above specimens. The posterior 




1851.] 171 



molar measures antero-posteriorly 4j inches, the sixth molar 3 J, and 

 the fifth molar has been about 3|^ inches. The angle of the jaw is 

 eight inches behind the posterior molar. The lower jaw has been full 

 two and a half feet long, and belonged to an animal three times the 

 size of the Palaeotherium magnum of Cuvier. 



Prof. Baird has also sent three fossil Tortoises from ths same locality, 

 one of which Dr. Leidy believed to be a new genus. 



Mr. Lea stated that he had examined the fossil bones of a reptilian quadruped^ 

 which Dr. J. Y. Shelley had sent to the Academy in Nov., 1847, from Upper 

 Milford, Lehigh Co., Pa., on Hossac's Creek, a tributary to the Perkiomen. 

 The notice of Dr. Shelley's donation, published in No. 7, Vol. 5, of the Proceed- 

 ings, as part of the Annual Report of the Recording Secretary, had not met Mr. 

 Lea's view until within a few days, it being there remarked, that these remains 

 were from a formation probably anterior to coal. 



The great interest which attaches to all these sauroid remains, induced Mr. 

 Lea to examine the specimens in the Cabinet of the Academy, when he was per- 

 fectly satisfied, by the lithological characters of the matrix, apd by the geogra- 

 phical position of the locality, that the epoch of the existence of this reptilian 

 quadruped had been misapprehended. The matrix was found to be carbonate of 

 lime, in the form of a conglomerate, and the locality near to the range of the 

 trappean hills, known as the " Conewago Hills" in Pennsylvania, and as the 

 Blue Mountains in Virginia. On the south of these intruded rocks, lies the 

 formation known by the geologists of the United States, generally, as the New 

 Red Sandstone, although Elie de Beaumont, and Dr. Jackson, of Boston, are not 

 of the opinion that it is the equivalent of the Trias or upper new red sandstone, 

 or the Permium or lower new red sandstone of Europe. Certain it is, however, 

 that this red sandstone formation, which stretches in a long and narrow band 

 from South Carolina to the Connecticut river, and exists probably at Truro, 

 in Nova Scotia, sometimes with considerable interruptions, has been found 

 to contain the foot prints of numerous genera and species of birds, and of 

 reptiles, as well as a large number of fishes. These have been chiefly ob- 

 served on the Connecticut river. But until now there had not been found in 

 this formation in the United States, so far as he knew, any bones of the ani- 

 mals which then inhabited its shores. It is well ascertained, that this calcareous 

 conglomerate forms the upper portion of the so-called new red sandstone forma- 

 tion, and lies on its northern border, appearing at various points : in the N. E. 

 part of New Jersey at Pompton, westwardly at Germantown in the same State, 

 and it is found crossing the Delaware at Spring Mills, about 15 miles below 

 Easton. It is recognized at the locality where these bones were found, in the 

 S. E. corner of Lehigh county, and in the same line south-westward, below 

 Reading, about one mile, where it exists in very large masses, the line of the 

 Philadelphia and Reading railroad making a deep cut through it. It there ex- 

 hibits its structure as a very coarse calcareous conglomerate of varitfus colors. 

 In the same direction it is found on the Potomac river, and is known there as the 

 Potomac marble, of which the columns of the Halls of Congress are made. 



Mr. Lea remarked that it was greatly to be regretted, that all the bones of this 

 specimen had not been obtained, but it was due to Dr. Shelley to say that Le 




172 [April, 



arrested from destruction and handed over to scientific investigation, with a 

 promptness that does him credit, what remained to be obtained. The rocks had 

 been taken out for the purpose of making the bed of a turnpike road, and the bonea 

 now in possession of the Academy consist of several vertebrae, parts of ribs and 

 two imperfect teeth, which certainly place this animal among the Saurians. 



To these remains, so fortunately preserved, Mr. Lea proposes to give a mature 

 examination, and the Curators have placed them under his charge for that pur- 

 pose. When prepared, a description and figures of the important portions of 

 these bones will be submitted by him for publication in the Journal of the 

 Academy. 



Mr. Lea thought it better to adopt a specific name without delay, but deemed 

 it advisable to postpone a generic one, until a further examination shall prove the 

 diagnosis, and then apply a descriptive one. He proposes rennsylvanicus as the 

 specific name. 



Oa leave granted, a memorial te the Legislature of Pennsylvania, 

 praying for the passage of an act authorizing the completion and pub- 

 lication of the final report of the Geological Survey of the State, was 

 presented and read. On motion, the same was adopted, and a copy 

 signed by the officers of the Academy was ordered to be transmitted 

 to the Legislature now in session.

A letter was read from the Royal Leopoldine Carolinian Academy 

 of Naturalists, dated Breslau, Jan. 21st, 1851, acknowledging the 

 receipt of late Nos. of the Proceedings. 



A letter was read from J. S. Gossler, Esq., dated Harrisburg, April 

 11th, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of the memorial addressed to 

 the Legislature by the Academy on the subject of the State Geological 

 Survey ; also another from the same, dated April 12th, 1851, announ- 

 cing the passage of the law by both Houses authorizing the publication 

 of the Report. 



Dr. Leidy presented, for the inspection of the members, a fossil Tortoise from 

 Nebraska Territory, received through Prof. Baird of the Smithsonian Institution. 

 The specimen consisted of four-fifths of the carapace and plastron, the former 

 considerably crushed. In general form it is like the genus Emys. It has been 

 about 7 inches in length, and about 5| in breadth ; iis height is about 2| inches. 

 An interval of one-eighth of an inch between the costal and marginal plates baa 

 been filled with cartilage. The union in the middle line of the sternum from 

 behind to the ento-sternal bone has also been cartilaginous. The outer extremi- 

 ties of the costal plates are alternately broad and narrow as in Testudo. The 

 most remarkable peculiarity of the animal has been the possession of four ac- 

 cessory bones, which do not exist in other genera. These bone? give additional 

 support to the carapace. Two are placed anterior to the attachment of the ster- 

 num to the marginal plates, and two posterior. The anterior are nearly straight 




1851.] 173 



and quadrilateral, and pass, one upon each side, from the antero-external angle 

 of the hyo-sternal bone obliquely upwards and inwards to a depression about the 

 middle of the outer margin of the first costal plate. The posterior columns of 

 support have nearly the same form as the anterior, and pass from the postero- 

 external angle of the hypo-sternal bone upwards, backwards and a little inwards 

 to a depression formed at the junction of the fifth and sixth costal plates. Dr. 

 L. gave to this fossil the generic and specific name of Stylerays* nebrascensis.

A letter was read from Mr. John Hooper, Secretary of the Brooklyn 

 Institute, dated New York, Feb. 17th, 1851, accompanying a beautiful 

 collection of native Algae, (42 species.) presented by him to the Aca- 

 demy, and offering to contribute further if desirable. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper, intended for publication in the Proceedings, 

 entitled " Notes of an Examination of the Birds composing the family 

 Caprimulgidae in the collection of the Acad. Nat. Sciences ;" which 

 was referred to Dr. Wilson, Dr. Watson, and Dr. Ruschenberger. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to two fossil Tortoises from 

 Nebraska Territory, received through Professor Baird. 



One of them consists of a great portion of the carapace and sternum broken 

 into two fragments. It belongs to the genus Testudo. Its length has been 

 about 2 feet, the breadth is 20 inches, and the height 9 inches. The bones are 

 thick and strong. The species Dr. L. named Testudo lata. 



The second specimen consists of four-fifths of the sternum and about one-third 

 of the carapax. In its perfect state it has been about 9J inches in length, 7|in 

 breadth, and about 5J high. The carapace is very convex. The costal plates 

 are alternately narrow and broad at their outer extremity, and have been united 

 to the marginal plates by cartilage. The latter rise at first a little convex from 

 the sternum, but are afterwards vertical. The species Dr. L. named Emys 

 hemispherica. 



Mr. Isaac Lea, referring to his late communication to the Academy 

 on the subject of fossil bones in the collection from the new red sand- 

 stone, stated that since then he had received the Proceedings of the 

 Boston Natural History Society, which contained a paper by Mr. 

 Welles, read in December last, noticing the fact that fossil bones of 

 large vertebrate animals had been found in two instances in the red 

 sandstone of Connecticut valley. Mr. Lee said that this was the first 

 notice he had met with of the discovery of bones of this character in 

 this formation. 



Dr. Morton offered some remarks on the infrequency of mixed off- 

 spring between the European and Australian races.

the fact there can no longer be a question ; it has even led to official inquiries on 

 the part of the Colonial Government, and is yet regarded as a physiological pa- 

 radox. 



Among many other questions which the Legislaiive Council of Sydney has 

 addressed to the colonial magistrates, was the following one : " Are there any, 

 and how many, half-castes in your district ?" The official replies of thirty-one 

 of these magistrates are published in detail in the " Minutes of Evidence " issued 

 by the Legislature of Sydney, in October, 1845.* From these Reports I have 

 drawn up the following Table, in which is given the name of each colony or 

 settlement the whole number of aborigines inhabiting its precincts, the number 

 of half-breeds living with the natives, and the number also of half-breeds who 

 remain with the white population.

* For these very interesting documents I am indebted to the kindness of Dr. Charles Nicholson, 

 iThighly intelligent member of the Legislative Council. 



t The magistrate testifies that there are "very few children" in his District, and that the 

 majority of them are half-caste. 



t This number, " one fifth," evidently alludes to the children, though it is vaguely expressed.

I " Very few. I have only seen two." 




1851.] 175 



Now we have here the extraordinary fact that, while the native population in 

 the thirty-one districts is represented to be nearly 15,000, the whole number of 

 half-caates or mulattoes does not exceed :iOO. 



The causes of this singular disparity have been variously surmised. Infanti- 

 cide at birth is one of them ; but this can have but a partial effect, for we find 

 that fully one-half of the mixed race is living with the natives. Syphilis is also 

 adduced, but its influence is manifestly very restricted. Promiscuous inter- 

 course is certainly a check upon fecundity ; but why should its influence be more 

 manifest in Australia than elsewhere ? and as to repugnance between the races, 

 this has been set aside by local circumstance.^. These and various other con- 

 siderations have been cited in explanation, but without satisfying the inquirer ; 

 and we may therefore ask, is not the real cause the difference of race^ the dis- 

 parity of primordial organization ? 



Perhaps no two human races are more remote from each other than the Eu- 

 ropean and Australian ; and where such extremes are blended, reason and analogy 

 lead as" to expect only a limited fertility. In connection with, and explanatory 

 of, this phenomenon. Count Strzelecki, a distinguished Polish traveller, has 

 stated the following proposition, which I give nearly in his own terms : — When- 

 ever a female of an aboriginal or barbarous tribe, has conceived by a European, 

 she loses the power of conception on a renewal of intercourse with a male of her 

 own race, retaining that only of procreating with a white man. " Hundreds of 

 instances of this extraordinary fact," observes Count Strzelecki, " are on record 

 in the writer's memoranda, to prove that the sterility of the female being relative 

 only to one, and not to another male, is not accidental, but follows laws as cogent , 

 though as mysterious, as the rest of those connected with generation." — New 

 South Wales and Van DiemerCs Land, p. 346. 



My object on the present occasion is merely to state the apparent facts of the 

 case, in order to draw the attention of physiologists, and observers in general, 

 to a more careful and extended notice of these reraarkabla phenomena.

Notes of an examination of the Birds composi7ig the family Caprimulgidm, in 

 the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



By John Cassin. 

 I. Caprimulgidse. 



No family of birds presents an aspect more uninviting, nor perhaps greater 

 real diflSculties in its investigation, nor has any one been more generally Neglec- 

 ted, than this. The great fathers of modern Zoology have been but rarely con- 

 sulted respecting their knowledge of Caprimulgus. 



The notes I am now about to offer, I have only to say, are the results of much 

 labor and of as careful research as I am capable of making with the assistance and 




170 [April, 



confirmation, too, of gentlemen of this Academy in whose judgment and accura- 

 cy I have the moat entire confidence. It is true, however, that they have been 

 written, and the material accumulated during my but limited leisure, or at such 

 fragments of time as I can spare from a business requiring constant attention, (and 

 between which and myself I find it difficult always to maintain the inlentecordiale,) 

 from which fact, I am fully aware, there may have arisen oversights or misap- 

 prehensions from want of more extended or more systematic study. I hope, how- 

 ever, that few such will be found, and at all events I shall have the gratification 

 of being one of the first to invite attention to a hitherto much neglected field for 

 investigation, and perhaps to induce others to enter upon the general examination 

 of the many species of birds, the names of which alone are known, and the 

 descriptions of which continue to be copied by succeeding authors from their 

 predecessors. 



2. Caprimulgus, Linn. 



This genus appears to be restricted to the old world. I have never seen a true 

 Caprimulgus from any part of America or the American islands. I propose to 

 notice in the course of this paper all the American genera, of which I will give 

 a list of such species as I have seen. 



3. Ilydropsalis. Wagler, Isis, xxv. p. 1222. (1832.) 



Original description. "Character universalis Caprimulgi; cauda profunde 

 furcata, rectrice utrinque extima elongatissima." 



Added by me. Bill rather long, (longer than tjpical Caprimnlgu=!) slender, 

 and compressed toward the tip, with about 8 or ten pairs of bristles, which are 

 longer than the bill and curved at the ends, gape moderate, nostrils medial, 

 somewhat elevated. 



Wings long, first and second primaries generally longest, second and third 

 strongly situated on their outer webs, three first primaries serrated on their 

 outer edges, shafts of primaries very strong. 



Tail usually with the two external feathers much longer than the others, 

 sometimes graduated, with the two middle feathers shortest, sometimes wiih the 

 two middle feathers lengthened and next in length to the external. 



Tarsi covered with scales and slightly feathered below the joint. Wings 

 without the white bar on the primaries which is found in typical Caprimulgus, 

 tail more or less marked longitudinally with white. 



Obs. — A very natural genus, first described by Wagbr as above in 1832, and 

 afterwards called Psalurus by Swainson in Cab. Cy. Birds, ii. p. 339 (1847.) It 

 appears to be exclusively American. 



The species of this genus which I have seen are : 



1. Ilydropsalis torquaius, (Gm.) Caprimulgus furcifer, Vieill. C. psalu- 

 rus, Temm. 



2. Mydropsalis limbatus, Ca.ss'm, {Oct. 1849.) 77. creoyra, Bonap. (1850.) 



3. Eydropsalis scgmentalus, Cassin, (Oct. 1849.) 



4. Hydropsalis lyra, Bonap. (1850.) 

 4. Hydropsalis torquatus, (Gm.) 



1. Caprimulgus torquatus, Gm. Syst. Nat. ii. p. 1032, (1788,) a name given 

 by Gmelin on the faith of the "Gold-collared Goatsucker" of Latham Gen., 




1851.] 177 



Syn. ii., pt. 2, p. 601, (1783,) who copies from Briss. Orn. ii., p. 481,. (1760,) 

 the latter giving the name of Capriinulgus Brasilier.sis on the faith of, and 

 copying the description of the Guira querea Basiliensibus of Marcgrave and 

 Piso in Historia Naturalis Brasilise, p. 202, (Amsterdam 1648.) 



2. Caprimulgus furcifer, Vieill. Nouv. Diet., x. p. 242, (1817,) a name given 

 by Vieillot on the faith of " Del cola de tixera" of Azara, Apunt. Hist. Nat- 

 del Paraguay, ii. p. 536, (Madrid 1805.) 



3. In copying Azara's description of the tail of this bird, Vieillot makes an 

 important mistake in substituting the French " plus" for the Spanish" m^nos." 



4. Caprimulgus psalurus, Temm. PI. col. ii. p., pi. 157, 158, (27 liv.) 



5. The above names are probably synonymes. 



6. Caprimulgus manurus, Vieill. Nouv. Diet. x. p. 239, (1817) ? 



The name Caprimulgus brasiliensis was given by Brisson to the bird de- 

 scribed by Marcgrave and Piso, as above, and he copies their description with 

 some alteration. He says of the tail, " Rectrices autem biuse intermediaelate- 

 ralibus multo sunt longioribus." 



The expression used by Marcgrave and Piso is, " Cauda octo digitos longa, 

 constans in extremitate dnabus pennis longioribus reliquis." 



In the tail of the common species known as Caprimulgus psalurus, Tem7n.,the 

 two outer feathers are much the longest of all, and the two middle feathers are 

 next in length, presenting a very unusual form. 



Gmelin, in his description (or rather definition) of C. torquatus, cites G. bra- 

 siliensis Briss. as a synonyme, also " Guira querea, Ray and Willoughby" and 

 "Gold-collared Goatsucker, Lath.," and copies Brisson's description of the tail 

 of this bird, which Latham had also done, but having seen the original descrip- 

 tion the latter adds, " The two middle tail feathers are eight inches in length.' 



The entire description by Marcgrave and Piso is copied almost verbatim by 

 Willoughby, Ornithologia, p. 71, (Folio, 1676). That of the tail is exactly the 

 same word for word, " Cauda octo digitos longa- constans in extremitate iu&hns 

 pennis longioribus reliquis." 



In Ray's edition, in English, of " the Ornithology of Francis Willoughby," 

 p. 108, (Folio, 1678,) he translates the Latin of Marcgrave and Willoughby 

 thus : " Tail eight inches long, having in the outsides two feathers longer than 

 the rest." 



The term used by Marcgrave, "in extremitate," is so equivocal, it is not 

 surprising that Brisson was perplexed, and to have fully justified Ray's 

 English, it would have looked better in the plural. Ray's translation is, how. 

 ever, quite as warrantable as any other, and with the description otherwise 

 answers suflficiently well for the Caprimulgus psalurus, Temm. PI. col. 157. I 

 am acquainted with no other American species to which can be applied thg 

 following from Marcgrave : " circum totum collum autem pone caput annulum 

 habet, obscure aureum." The size given by Marcgrave is not very definite : 

 " Alaudas magnitudine est, sed quia longas alas et caudam habet multp longio- 

 rem, videtur major." This phrase is copied by the subsequent writers above 

 mentioned, in the course of the observations of whom nothing occurs from 

 which I can infer that either of them had seen the species. 



Upon comparing a specimen of C. psalurus with either Alauda mrvensis or 

 cristata it will be found that the comparison made use of by Marcgrave may be 




178 [April, 



applied to this bird without such an extended exercise of the imagination aa 

 might at first appear necessary, throwing out of the case too his " videtur ma- 

 jor." His only other dimensions are " digiti fere longitudine," applied to the 

 bristles, " rostri superioris ad latera," and " Alas longas habet nimirum semi- 

 pedem," both of which answer quite well for the bird we now suppose them 

 to have been applied to, and so does his description in all other respects. 



I beg to remind the reader, however, that I have no disposition whatever to 

 attempt to make out a case, ex jiarte, and therefore suggest the possibility of 

 Marcgrave and perhaps Brisson having had in view an African species, the 

 Caprimulgus climacurus, Vieill. Gal. dcs Ois. i. pi. 122, which will suit their 

 descriptions to some extent. Probably at the time Marcgrave wrote (1648) 

 and certainly in the time of Brisson, (1760) bird skins from Africa were often 

 taken to Brazil by vessels engaged in the slave trade, and errors respecting 

 locality might have occurred readily. 



The tail of this bird has been particularly unfortunate. In the description 

 by Azara, in " Apuntamientos para la historia natural de los Paxaros del 

 Paraguay," ii. p. 537, (octavo, Madrid, 1805,) he gives the dimensions of the 

 tail of his " Del cola de tixera" thus : " cola 10 plumas : la de afuera 6 primera 

 24 Uneas mas larga que la segunda : esta 5 mas que la tercera : y esta 2 mas 

 que la quarta, y 11 minos que la central." 



In the French edition of Azara, (Walckeuaer's) iv. p. 115, (octavo, Paris, 

 1809) these dimensions are given correctly : "Des 10 (pennes) de la queue, 

 I'exterieure a 24 linges de plus que la deuxieme, celle-ci 5 de plus que la 

 troisieme, et cette derniere 2 de plus que la quatrieme, et 11 de moins que les 

 2 du milieu." 



But Vieillot in Nouv. Diet. x. p. 242, in his description of Caprimulgus fur ci- 

 fer, which is copied from Azara almost verbatim, alters one most important 

 word in the dimensions as given above ; he says, " Cette queu a la penne ex- 

 terieure de vingt-quatre linges plus longue que la deuxieme, celle-ci en a cinq 

 de plus que la troisieme, et cette derniere deux de plus que la quatrieme, et 

 onze de plus que les deux du milieu." 



This error has, of course, caused some confusion, and Vieillot's description 

 containing it appears to have been relied on by some authors, (including 

 Bonaparte, in Consp. Av.) 



This tail was a standing riddle to Vieillot. In Eucy. Mcth. ii. p. 543, (quarto, 

 Paris, 1823,) although he continues to copy the description of Azara, he fur- 

 ther alters, thus : "Cette queue a sa penne exterieure plus longue de vingt- 

 quatre linges que la deuxieme ; celli-ci en a cinq de plus la troisieme, qui 

 en a deux de plus que la quatrieme, qui surpaste les deux du milieu de pres d'un 

 pouce." 



All the dimensions of Azara answer very well for the Caprimulgus psalurua, 

 Temm., in young plumage or perhaps in the plumage of winter, which was 

 the season when the observations of Azara were made, "He visto," he says, 

 "algunos siempre solos, y en lo mas crudo del invierno nunca en verano|ni 

 primavera." 



The synonymes of this species given by Hartlaub, in Systematischer Index 

 zuDon Felix de Azara's Apuntamientos, &c., p. 19, (quarto pamphlet, Bremen, 

 1847,) are entirely correct as far as they go. 



The fact that a specimen in the British Museum is named Caprimulgus manurus 




1851.] 179 



Vieill., and inserted in the catalogue fp. 10) as distinct, only prevents me from 

 giving that name, also, as a synonyme for the present species. I do not see 

 how the species can be made out from Vieillot's description in either Nouv. 

 Diet. X. p. 239, (1817) or Ency. Meth. ii, p. 540, (1823) which both contain 

 important errors. In the original description (Nout. Diet.) he says, " Nous 

 verrons par la suite un engoulevent dont la troisieme penne de la queue est la 

 pluslongue de toutes ; singularity qui ne se rencontre chez aucun autre oiseau. 

 Celle du Manure se presente sous une forme plus extraordinaire ; la premiere 

 peane caudale de chaque c6t6 est tres longue et d^passe les deux interm^di- 

 ares d'environ cinq pouces ; les troisieme et quatrieme sont tres courte, et la 

 cinquifeme, qui a plus de longeur qui celles-ci, est plus courtes que les deui 

 du milieu qui ont plusieurs pouces de moins que les deux premieres." 



The third feather of the tail is twice mentioned and contradictorily repre- 

 sented, the second feather is not described at all, and the fifth is said to be 

 shorter than the two in the middle, which must be considered as making twelve 

 tail feathers, when really Hydropsalis and other American Caprimulgi have not 

 more than ten. In Ency. Meth. the observation ^^ Nous verrons" &c., is omitted. 

 He proceeds, however, with exactly the same description, which even without 

 the introductory representation that the third feather is longest of all is not in- 

 telligible, because the fifth is still represented as "plus courte que celles du 

 milieu." There are mistakes here, now difiicultto correct, but as the descrip- 

 tions in both books are otherwise quite like the species now before us, I have 

 little doubt that it is the bird meant by this distinguished and learned naturalist, 



5. Genus Stenopsis, nobis, nov. gen. 



Bill longer than typical Caprimulgus, tapering and depressed ; upper man- 

 dible with about six or seven pairs of bristles, which are very rigid at their 

 bases, but very slender and curved at their tips ; gape very moderate, nostrils 

 medial ; aperture somewhat elevated. 



Wings moderate, second and third primaries longest (usually the second) 

 and sinuated on their outer webs. Tail ample, fan-shaped, truncate or slightly 

 emarginate. Tarsi slightly feathered below the joint, shorter than the mid 

 die toe and claw, and covered with scales. 



Wings with a conspicuous white bar in males, and probably in females ; 

 neck with a broad and uninterrupted collar, white in front, and fulvous 

 behind ; tail usually with a large portion of white on the external feathers ; 

 characters of the bill resembling Hydropsalis, Wagler. 



Obs. — Another exclusively American genus, the bill in which very consid- 

 erably resembles that of Hydropsalis. The species which I have seen are: 



1. Stenopsis cayennensis, (Gm.) PI. Enl. 760. Jard. and Sel., HI. pi. 87. 



2. Stenopsis longirostris, (Bon&ip.) Jour. Acad., Philada., iv. p. 384. 



3. Stenopsis parvulus, (Gould.) Proc. Zool. Soc, London, 1837, p. 22. 

 Which have several synonymes. 



6. Genus Nyctidromus, Gould, Icones Avium, part ii. (August, 1838.) 

 The species which I have seen of this genus are : 



1. Nyctidromus americanus, (Linn.) Caprimulgus albicollis, Gm. Nyctidromut 

 Derbyanus, Gould. 



2. Nyctidromus guianensis, (Gm.) 



3. Nyctidromus grallarius, Bonap. 




180 [ApBiL, 



7. Nyctidromus americanus, Linn. 



1. Caprimulffus americanus, Linn. Syst. Nat. i. p. 346, (1766,) a aame gives 

 by Linnaeus on the faith of Caprimulgus seu Noctua tylvatica Jamaycensis minor. 

 described by Ray, Syn. Av. et Pis. Appendix, p. 180, (171.3,) who copies his de- 

 scription from the miinuscripts of Sir Hans Sloane, which were afterwards 

 published in Nat. Hist. Jamaica ii. p. 296, (1725,) with a figure, pi. 255, fig. I. 



2. Caprimulgus allicollts, Gm. Syst. Nat. ii. p. 1030, (1788) a name given by 

 Gmelin on the faith of the White-throated Goatsucker of Latham, Gen. Syn. 

 ii. pt. 2, p. 596. 



3. Nyctidromus Derhyanus, Gould, Icon. Av. part ii. p. pi. (August, 1838.) 



4. These names are probably synonymes, and the original describers from 

 specimens are Sloane for C. americanus, Latham for C. albicollis and Gould 

 for N. Derbyanus, — to which Azara may be added, (Del Ybiyau, Apunt. ii. p. 

 538, 1805.) 



The Caprimulgus americanus of Linnaeus appears to have been founded on 

 the faith principally of Ray's description, and on Sloane's description and 

 figure. Linuasus enumerates two species only of Caprimulgus, the first of which 

 (C europcBus,) he briefly characterizes as " C. narium tubis obsoletis," and the 

 second ( C. americanus,) as " C. narium tubulis eminentibus." He cites as syno- 

 nymes the description and figure of Sloane, and the description by Ray, as 

 above, also " Caprimulgus jamaicensis, Briss. Av. ii. p. 480," and " Hiruudo 

 major subfusca miscella, macula alba spha2rica in utraque alba. Brown, Jam. 

 p. 467." 



In Brown's Jamaica, p. 4G7, (Civil and Natural History of Jamaica, by Patrick 

 Brown, M. D., London, 175G,) there is a short and entirely inconclusive descrip- 

 tion, the most importaut feature in which is, that the bird is "about the size 

 of a Sparrow Hawk, and of a darkish, mottled and striped colour." He gives 

 as synonymes, "Catesby i. pi. 8" and "The lesser Goatsucker of Edwards, pi. 

 63," both of which are Caprimulgus voci/erus, Wilson. 



Brisson, in Orn, ii. p. 480, (1760) under the head of Caprimulgus Jamaicensis , 

 copies Sloane's description above referred to, and gives several names as syn- 

 onymes, among them oue from Brown, different from that given by LinnsEus, that 

 is to say " Strix capite levi, plumis griseo albidus labiorum pilosus. Brown, Hist, 

 of Jam. p. 473." Upon turning to this I find a bird described as " The screech 

 Owl," with the Latin phrase just quoted, which comprises the entire description. 



The synonymes, then, to the point we have now attained are, for much thft 

 greater part, unsatisfactory, nor are Brown's descriptions of any account 

 whatever, so far as relates to actually determining the species. 



Gmelin, in his edition of the Syst. Nat. of Linn. ii. p. 1032 (1788,) gives as 

 additional synonymes, " Engoulevent a lunettes ou Haleur, Buff. hist. nat. des 

 ois, vi. p. 543," and "American Goatsucker, Lath, syu. ii. 2, p. GOO, n. 14," 

 both of which are avowedly founded on Sloane's description and figure. 



Geo. R. Gray, in Genera of Birds, gives this as a Chordeiles, citing Sloane's 

 figure. It is by no possibility a Chordeiles, in which there is no such char- 

 acter as " along the upper mandible were several bristly hairs in line," as 

 stated by Sloane and represented in his plate. 

 Gosse, in Birds of Jamaica, p. 51, thinks it may be his Nyciibius pallidum, which 




1851.J 181 



is also impossible fpr the reason just stated, and others which are obvious 

 upon examination of Sloane's description and figure. 



Bonaparte, in Conspectus Avium, p. 63, places Caprimulgus americanus, 

 Linn., as a Chordeiles. 



It does not appear that either of the authors cited, from Ray to the present 

 time, ever saw a bird which he understood to be the Caprimulgus americanus, 

 Linn., for which Sloane is the sole authority. In fact, the exact expressions used 

 by him are repeated by nearly all writers ; — for instance, the term " Feuille 

 mort," which he applies to the color of his bird, is copied exactly by Brisson, 

 Boffon, Vieillot, and Latham, while Gmelin Latinizes it into "folii marcidi." 

 For the purpose, then, of ascertaining or rendering probable what bird is 

 entitled to the name of Caprimulgus americanus^ Linn., there is nothing left 

 but to revert to the description and figure of Sloane, and to the description 

 in the catalogue of Sloane's birds, by Ray, who describes " exejusdemSchedis 

 manuscriptis," in Syn. Av. App., p. 180. 



Adifliculty occurs at once, which has perplexed authors. It is that, although 

 Sloane describes his bird as " seven inches from the end of the bil' to that of 

 the tail," he gives a figure about eleven inches long, respecting which BufFon 

 justly enough observes, " qu'il est fort rare que Ton donne de pareilles figures 

 grossies." _R-ay says, " parva admodum avis est, septem non plus digitis longa," 

 having seen the manuscript only. Gmelin, Vieillot, G. R. Gray and Bonaparte ap- 

 pear to rely on the text, exclusive of the figure. Brisson says eleven inches long, 

 without comment, relying on the latter. BuflFon (Hist. Nat. des Ois. vi., p. 544, 

 1799,) attempts to elucidate, and suggests that the measure given by Sloane may 

 have been taken to the base of the tail only , which he says with the tail (4 inches) 

 would coincide with the length of the figure. Latham, perhaps taking the idea 

 from BufiFon, offers a similar supposition. But Sloane says very distinctly," from 

 the end of the bill to that of the tail," and it is clear enough and easily ascer- 

 tained that all the other birds described and figured by him were so measured. 

 It is suflBciently evident to me that Sloane's measurements are simply wrong ; 

 he says, " This was seven inches long from the end of the bill to that of the tail, 

 and ten from the end of wing to wing expanded — the tail was four inches long." 

 It would be difl&cult to find a bird with such relative dimensions, especially a 

 Caprimulgus. It is simply a mistake made by Sloane himself, as it evidently 

 was so written in his manuscript, according to Ray. Nor are the dimensions 

 given by him ever entirely to be relied on, for the good and sufficient reason that 

 he measured with his thumb, " which," he says, " with a little allowance, I reck- 

 oned an inch." (Preface to Vol. i., p. 2.) I am disposed to reject his dimen- 

 sions entirely, as given in the description of the species now under considera- 

 tion, but to place full dependence on those of the figure; because, as he says ex- 

 pressly, his figures were made " on the place." " I employed," says he, " the 

 Reverend Mr. Moore, one of the best designers I could meet with there, to take 

 the figures of them, (fruits,) also of the Fishes, Birds, Insects, &c.,in crayons, 

 and carried him with me into several places of the country, that he might take 

 them on the place." The Reverend Mr. Moore, no doubt, came generally pretty 

 near the right size, but, otherwise, did not acquit himself very handsomely in 

 birds, judging from the engravings. In plants, however, he did much better. 




182 [April, 



Rejecting, then, the measurements in the description, U is otherwise, with 

 the plate, sufficient to determine the genus and perhaps the species. 



The bird belongs to the genus Nyctidromus, Gould, Icon. Av., part ii., and the 

 species is probably N. Derbyanus, Gould, upon which the genus is founded. 

 It is stated in Sloane's description that " it had a quarter of an inch long 

 crooked black bill, with two tubuli, about one-eighth part of an inch long, 

 for nostrils ; along the upper mandible were several bristly hairs in a line — the 

 legs and feet were an inch and a half long, covered with brown scales ; the toes 

 four, three before, that in the middle three quarters of an inch long, and one 

 behind." "The head and back," he says, "were covered with feathers of a 

 mixed color ot/euille mort, grey and black, the wings and tail were of the same 

 color, only lighter, under the chaps, breast and belly, were also of the same. 



All these characters, except the colors, are represented in the plate. 



They are all, including the colors, to be found in the genus Nyctidromus, 

 and there only. Tubular or elevated nares — " Nares sub-basales elevatae " 

 (Gould) are characteristic. It is the only American genus with legs entirely 

 bare, except one species of Podager, and there is no species of any American 

 genus at all, to the color of which the term " feuille mort" can be applied 

 with as great propriety as to those of this. 



The entire description, so far as relates to color, applies to all the species 

 of the genus Nyctidromus, of which there are three. They are so much alike 

 that they can scarcely be said to differ in any other respect than size. The 

 largest of these species, which is about the size of Sloane's figure, I am dis- 

 posed to conclude is the Caprimulgus americanus, Linn., and that it is the 

 same as the Nyctidromus Derbyanus, Gould, a common South American bird. 



It is important that it should be mentioned, however, that this bird has not 

 been observed in Jamaica by Mr. Gosse, or by any other writer, so far as my 

 knowledge extends. Should future investigations elicit the fact that it does 

 inhabit that island, I shall consider the matter settled beyond a doubt. That 

 a species of Nyctidromus does inhabit Jamaica, and which'is not mentioned 

 by Mr. Gosse, Sloane's figure and description clearly demonstrate. 



Caprimulgus albicollis, Gm., is the white-throated Goatsucker of Latham, 

 described by him from a specimen " in the collection of Major Davies, sup- 

 posed to have come from Cayenne." The description is accurate, except that 

 the size is rather small, " length, ten inches and a quarter," but, of course, 

 taken from a skin. In Gen. Hist, vii., p. 359, he (Latham) gives the length 

 twelve inches, and an excellent description under the same name, and justly 

 cites "L'Ibiyan, Voyage d'Azara, iv. No. 310," as a synonyme. This citation 

 is of the French edition of Azara, with notes by Cuvier and Sonnini, Paris, 

 1809. (Walckenaer's edition.) The description by Azara is the best extant. 

 Gould's figure in Icon. Av. is incomparable. 



The bird now under consideration is the Caprimulgus albicollis, Gm., of 

 the greater number of the European authors; occasionally, however, this 

 name is applied to the bird which is properly Caprimulgus guianensis, Gm.. 

 as by De Wied, Beitr. iii., p. 318. 



It also appears to be the Caprimulgus laticaudut. Drapiez. Diet. Clase. 

 d'Hist. Nat. vi., p. 169. (Paris, 1824. octavo.) 




1851.] 183 



8. Nyctidromus guianensis. (Gm.) 



Gmelin gives this name on the faith of the " Guiana Goatsucker " of Latham, 

 Gen. Syn. ii, pt. 11, p. 598, and " Le Montvoyau de la Guyane" of Buffon, Hist. 

 Nat. des Ois. vi., p. 549, figured in PI. Enl. 733, (which represents a young bird). 



It is very similar to the preceding, but differs in size. 



The Prince de Wied., in Beit, zur Nat. von Bras. iii.,p. 318, gives the most 

 satisfactory description extant of this bird. He says, however, that it is the 

 female of C. albicollis, which name he cites accordingly as a synonyme. He 

 is high authority on the birds of Brazil, but as I am not aware that so great 

 a difference in the size of the sexes occurs in this difficult group, I have pre- 

 ferrgd. at present, retaining it as a distinct species. 



9. Nyctidromus grallarius. (Bonaparte.) 



This appears to be a third species, of which there are several specimens in 

 the collection of this Academy. Bonaparte's description is not, however, 

 sufficiently explicit, and may possibly be intended for something else. 



10. Genus Anirosiomus, " Gould." Bonap. Comp. List, p. 8. G. R. Gray, 

 List Gen., p. 9, "Gould, Icon. Av., 1838." Agassiz Nomen. Zool. Aves., 

 p. 6, "Gould," Nuttall Man. Orn. i., p. 739, (1840). 



Obs. — I have not found the original description of this genus by Gould. It 

 is not contained in the copy of Icones Avium in the library of this Academy, 

 and I suspect that the only description is that by Nuttall, in Man. Orn. 1, p. 

 739, (1840). I have seen the following species : 



1. Antrostomus carolinensis. (Gm.) And. B. of Am., pi. 52. 



2. Antrostomus rufus. (Gm.) Buff. PI. Enl., 735. 



3. Antrostomus serico-caudatus, Cassin, Jour. Acad. Philadelphia ii., pi. 12 

 (Quarto). 



4. Antrostomus vociferus. (Wilson.) Am. Orn. v., p. 71, pl. 41. 



5. Antrostomus macro-mystax. Wagler, Isis, 1831, p. 533 (a species)? 



6. Antrostomus ocellatus. (Tschudi.) Fauna Peruana Aves, pl. 5, fig. 2. 



7. Antrostomus Nutlallii. (And.) B. of Am. (Octavo) vii., p. 350, pl. 495. 

 The two latter species vary from the typical characters, and may be 



entitled to constitute a distinct genus. I have seen also one other- small 

 species, of which a young specimen is in the collection of the Academy, and 

 is labelled as being from Cayenne. I cannot identify it. 



11. Antrostomus carolinensis. ( Gm.) 



In the genus Antrostomus, and in this species particularly, the bristles which 

 have their origin in the upper mandible reach their maximum. They exist how- 

 ever in greater or lesser degree of development in all typical Caprimulgidie. 



In the present species, these bristles are not only long and rigid, but each 

 one is ciliated, or, as Audubon expresses it, " with lateral filaments." It. ig 

 ihe only species in which I have observed such formation. 



12. Antrostomus rufus. (Gm.) 



This bird, named by Gmelin, (Syst. Nat. ii., p. 1030,) on the faiih of the 

 description by Latham of " the rufous Goatsucker," (Gen. Syn. ii., pt. 2, p. 

 597,) who copies from Buffon's " Engoulevent roux de Cayenne," (Hist, Nat. 

 des Ois. vi., p. 545,) is another of the species which have been lost sight of. 




181 [April, 



A specimen in tlic Rivcli collection appears to be this bird. Though much 

 resembling A carolinemis, in colors and general appearance, it is smaller, the 

 wiugg are shorter, and the bristles along the bill are simple, not ciliated, as 

 in that species, and are, as BufTon says, "tres roides." I may observe, by 

 the way, that, although this author oxpressly describes his bird as having 

 the bill bordered by nine or ten pairs of very stiff "moustaches," he omits 

 them in his plate. (PI. Enl. 735.) 



The specimen alluded to does not accurately agree with Buffon's figure ; 

 the bill is longer, and the lateral tail feathers are largely tipped with white, 

 the neck has, moreover, a whitish collar. I suspect that the A. rufus is a 

 South American species nearly allied to A. carolinensU. 



13. Antrostomus macrornystax. (Wagler.) Isis, 1831, p. 533. 



I have attached this name to two specimens from California, which are 

 very nearly related to A. voci/erus, (Wilson). They seem to be the bird 

 meant in the description, or rather notice, by Wagler, as above. 



14. Genus Nycdbius. Vieillot, Analyse, p. 38. 



Obs. — This genus is one of the most easily recognized in the circle of the 

 Oaprimulgidie, and is another which is exclusively American. I have seen 

 the following species : 



1. Nyctibius grundis. (Gm.) Gray's Gen., pi. 16. 



2. Nyctibius cethereus. De Wied.) Reise, Bras, i., p. 236. 



3. Nyctibius longicaudatus. (Spii.) Av. Bras, ii., pi. 1. 



4. Nyctibius jamaicensis. (Gm.) Gosse, 111. B. of Jam., pi. 6. 



5. Nyctibius leucopUrus. (De Wied.) Des Murs, Icon. Orn., pi. 49, 50. 



6. Nyctibius bracteatus. Gould. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1846, p. 1. 



15. Nyctibius grandis. (Gm.) 



The Wood Owle of Sloane, (Nat. Hist. Jamaica ii., p. 295,) and the Guira 

 querea of Buffon, (Hist. Nat. des Ois. vi., p. 570, Quarto, 1783,) appear to be 

 this species. I am not acquainted with any other American species which 

 has the jaws three inches in width, as stated by both the authors cited, nor to 

 which their descriptions in other respects can be more properly applied. 



Latham (Gen. Syn. ii., pt. 2, p. 591,) gives both those names as synonymes 

 for his "Jamaica Goatsucker," of which he gives a description and figure — 

 upon transferring which to his edition of the Systema Naturae, Gmelin gives 

 the name Caprimulgus j'lmaicensis (Syst. Nat. ii., p. 1029,) and also erroneously 

 cites as synonymes the same names as Latham. The figure given by Latham 

 (Gen. Syn. ii., pt. 2, pi. 57,) represents the N. jamaicensis, which is a well 

 known species, and that plate seems to have saved Gmeliu's name from being 

 a synonyme of the N. grandis, there being little in the description which 

 may not be applied to the latter, except the size. 



16. Nyctibius selhereus, (De Wied.) 



1. Caprimulgus seihereus, described by De Wied in Reise nach Brasilien i., p. 

 23G, (1820). 



2. Caprimulgus longicaudatus, described by Spix in Av. Bras, ii., p. 1, (1825). 




1851.] 185 



3. De Wied, in Beitrage zur Nat. von Bras. iii. p. 303, 310, (1830,) expresses 

 his conviction that these two names are synonymes, and they are so regarded 

 by Gray in Cat. Fissi. Brit. Mus., p. 5, by Bonaparte in Cons. Av., p. 58, and 

 by others. 



4. They are distinct species. 



That very excellent naturalist, Maximilian, Pr':ice de Wied, appears to have 

 been the first to notice this fine species, which he named as above. He ap- 

 pears, however, not to have seen Spix's specimens, but to have arrived at the 

 conclusion that C. longicaudatus is the same as his C. sethereus, from the figure 

 and description given in Av. Bras. 



Notwithstanding such high authority, I feel myself compelled to decide from 

 specimens in the collection of this Academy, that these are two species. N. xthe- 

 reus is much the larger bird, being about the size ai N. grandis. It measures in 

 total length fully 22 inches, as stated in De Wied's description. N. longicauda- 

 tus vat&SMve.s only 18 inches, and is in all other respects smaller, though with 

 a comparatively longer tail. The colors of the plumage in both species present 

 considerable similarity, though in N. ictkereus they are darker, and the longi- 

 tudinal stripes much more strongly defined. They are so much unlike that 

 no person would consider them the same who saw them together. 



All the species of this genus which I have seen have more or less prominent, 

 erect, earlike feathers above the eye. These are quite obvious in N. sethereus. 

 Two specimens of N. sethereus and one of N. longicaudatus are in the collection. 

 I have seen another specimen of the former in the collection of the United States 

 Exploring Expedition (Vincennes and Peacock) at Washington, which is 

 labelled " Nyctibius grandis," and so called in Mammalia and Ornithology of 

 U. S. Exploring Expedition by T. R. Peale, p. 327, of course erroneously. 



(In the publication here alluded to, of which there are thirty copies only in 

 the United States, but one in Pennsylvania, and none in the city of Philadelphia, 

 the general history of, and description of supposed new species of Caprimulgi- 

 dae, and, in fact, of all the Fissirostres, are erroneous to an extraordinary extent. 

 I have only so far carefully examined it, but have suflicient knowledge of the 

 book to be fully satisfied that little confidence can be placed in any of M^. 

 Peale's birds, described as new, of which there are upwards of a hundred.) 



17. Ngctibius j'amaicemis, (Gm.) 



1. Caprimulgus jamaicemis. Gm., Syst. Nat., ii. p. 1029, (17&8,> a name 

 given by Gmelin on the faith of the "Jamaica Goatsucker" described by 

 Latham, Gen. Syn., ii. pt. 2, p. 591, (1783.) 



2. Caprimulgus griseus. Gm., Syst. Nat., ii. p. 1029, (1788,) a name given by 

 Gmelin on the faith of the " grey Goatsucker " of Latham, Gen. Syn., ii. pt. 2, 

 p. 592, (1783,) which is derived from the " Engoulevent grts " of Buffon, Hist. 

 Nat. des Ois, vi. p. 548, (1779.) 



3. Caprimulgus cornutus. Vieill., Nouv. Diet., x. p. 245, (1817,) a name 

 given by Vieillot to the " Urutau " of Azara, Apunt. Hist. Nat. Paraguay, ii. 

 p 527, (1805.) 



4. These names are probably synonymes, to which may be added Nyctibius 

 urutau, La Fresnaye, Guer. Mag., 1837, p. 28, and NT/ciibius pectoralis., Gould, 

 Icones Avium, pi. 16, (August, 1838.) 



25 




186 [April, 



No one of six specimens, all of which I consider the N. jamaicensis as de- 

 scribed by Mr. Gosse in his delightful and valuable volume on the Birds of 

 Jamaica, p. 41, appears to have been so large as indicated by his measurementa. 

 There is, however, no reliance whatever to be placed on the measurements of 

 skins, so far as relates to the total lengths, and those of other parts are also lia- 

 ble to error, botii from the distortion of the skin in the course of preparation, 

 and from various modes of measuring by naturalists. 



The measurements given by the authors cited above vary considerably, but 

 their descriptions are, I think, sufficiently similar. One specimen in the Rivoli 

 collection (labelled C. Gouldii,) is certainly Mr. Gould's N.pectoraLis, though it 

 is rather too large for his description, but not large enough for his figure in 

 Icones Avium ; the wing, for instance, measuring about 10^ inches, instead of 9^ 

 as in the description, or 10| as in the figure. It appears to me to be the bird 

 described by Mr. Gosse, whom I consider the best authority for the species, 

 and, so far as I can see, quite justified in quoting N. pectoralis, Gould, as a 

 synonyme. Gosse'a and Gmelin's descriptions are sufficiently similar, — that 

 of the latter is, however, copied from Latham. 



To this bird, in very nearly the same plumage as figured by Mr. Gould, the ob- 

 servations by La Fresnaye on N. urutau seem to apply, which avowedly pro- 

 fesses to be the same as C. cornutus, VieilL, or the urutau of Azara. The descrip- 

 tion by Vieillot is copied from that of Azara, and corresponds remarkably well 

 with that in Walckenaer's French edition of Azara, iv. p. 112, (Paris, 1809.) 



The description by BufFon of the Engoulevenl gris, which is C. griseus, Gm., 

 applies very well so far as it goes to the young bird of this species. Tliere is a 

 specimen in the collection of the Academy not fully grown which is nearly white. 

 This description by Buffon is the sole foundation for the Caprimulgus griseus, 

 Gm., a name which has maintained a place in all systems and compilations to the 

 present time, no bird having ever been found to suit it, to my knowledge. 



18. Scotornis longicaudus. (Drapiez.) 



This is the African bird described by Vieillot as Caprimulgus cUmacurus, and 

 figured in Gal. des Ois., pi. 22, 1825. It appears to have been first described 

 by Drapiez in Dictionnaire Classique D'Histoire Naturelle, vi. p. 160, (Paris, 

 1824, Octavo,) next by Vieillot, in 1825, and in the same year (1825) again 

 named Caprimulgus longicaudis, by Stephens, Gen. Zool., xiii. p. 89, on the 

 faith of a description and figure by Latham in Gen. Hist., vii. p. 335, pi. 114. 

 The latter calls it "the long tailed Goatsucker." 



19. Genua Chordeiles. Swainson, Faun. Bor. Am. Birds, p. 466. 



Obs. — Of this genus I have seen the following species, the first three of 

 which have several synonymes : 



1. Chordeiles virginianus. (Briss.) Aud., B. of Am., pi. 147. 



2. Chordeiles brasilianus. (Gm.) 



3. Chordeiles acutus. (Gm.) Buff., PI. Enl., 732. 



4. Chordeiles rupestris. (Spix.) Av. Bras., ii. pi. 2. 



5. Chordeiles sapid. Bonap.. Consp. Av., p. 63. 



There is also in the collection of this Academy a bird which I suppose to be 

 Chordeiles minutus, Bonap., Cons. Av., p. 63. It suits the short description but 




1851.] 187 



indifferently, however, and is, as Bonaparte observes, " vix hujus generis." It 

 belongs more properly to my genus Lurocalis, (Art. 23 of this paper.) 



20. Chordeiles brasilianus. (Gm.) 



1. Caprimulgus brasilianus. Gm., Syst. Nat., ii. p. 1031, (1788,) a name given 

 on the faith of " the Brazilian Goatsucker" of Latham, Gen. Syn., ii. pt. 2, p. 

 598 (1 783), who compiled from Brisson Orn. ii. p 483 (1760), who copied from 

 Marcgrave and Piso's "Ibijau Brasiliensibus ; Noitibo Lusitanis," Hist. Nat. 

 Bras., p. 195, (1648.) 



2. Caprimulgus noitibo. Vieill., Nouv. Diet., x. p. 241, a name substituted by 

 Vieillot for the above. 



3. Caprimulgus variegatus. Vieill., Nouv. Diet., x. p. 238, (1817,) a name 

 given on the faith of " Del Jaspeado " of Azara, Apunt., ii. p. 546, (1805.) 



4. " Caprimulgus j'aspide.us, Merrem." Bonap., Consp. Av., p. 61. 



" Caprimulgus brasilianus, Lin. Gm. Prinz. Max. Beitr., iii. p. 337," is errone- 

 ously given in Tschudi, Fauna Peruana, Orn., p. 20, as a synonyme for Capri- 

 mulgus ocellatus, Tschudi, Fau. Peru, pi. 5, fig. 2, originally described in Avium 

 conspectus Fau. Per., p. 8, (1844,) and which is certainly the bird described by 

 the Prince de Wied under the name of " C. brasilianus, Linn. Gm. Lath." 



C. ocellatus, Tsch., we regard at present as an aberrant Antrostomus, and it 

 does not belong to the same genus as the C. brasilianus, Gm., which is a 

 Chordeiles. 



Upon referring to the description given by .Marcgrave, as above, which is 

 copied almost verbatim by Willoughby, (Orn., p. 70,) and essentially by Brisson, 

 Latham, and Vieillot, characters will be found, I think, sufficient to determine 

 both genus and species, " Caput habet latum et compressum, — exterius autem 

 oculos ambit circulus exo albo flavescens. Rostellum minimum habet quod non 

 excedit crassitiem dentis aranei (sorex araneus, Linn. ?) nee tam longum est. 

 Nares tamenpatentes in rostro. Caudam habet elegantem, quam in latum potest 

 explicare, duos digitos longam, cum cujus extremitate alse desinunt.— Crura 

 alba et secundum corporis molem parvula, vix semidigitum longa." 



Among the American Caprimulgidje the colored ring around the eye, the very 

 small bill, the short tail, and the wings equal to the tail in length, are combined 

 only in the genus Chordeiles. Nothing is said by Marcgrave about the bristles 

 at the base of the bill, but as he particularly mentions them in the description 

 of his only other species, (p. 202,) it is safe to infer that none existed in the 

 present bird, which raises an additional presumption in favor of Chordeiles. 

 Let us see what can be made of the specific characters : " Avicula hirundinis 

 magnitudine, — penna^i in toto corpore inferiore habet ex albis et nigro mixtas ut 

 J^isus, in capite, dorso, alls et cauda nigricante et albido inspersa grata varietate; 

 nonnihil quoque flavedinis albedini admixtum, uno verbo, nigro est et punctu- 

 lata subtiliter hinc inde." 



This description applies to the bird now before me, which is that described 

 with his usual great ability by the Prince de Wied as C. semitorquatuf. The 

 coloring of the under surface of the body bears a decided resemblance to that 

 of Accipiter nisus, (Linn.,) and in all respects I think it is clearly the C. bra- 

 silianus, Gm. 



Itwillbeobservedthatthecolor of thetail is represented as similar to that of 




188 • [April, 



the upper pnrts of the bodjr. Neither the white spots near the end of the tail 

 feathers, nor the white collar in front of the neck are mentioned, which I can- 

 not account for, as the latter is not absent in any American Goatsucker. The 

 bird described may have been young, or a female. The expression " taudam 

 clegantem " alludes i)robably more to the form than the color. 



Caprimulfjux noUiho, Vicill., is avowedly a substitute for the name given by 

 Gmeliii. Vieillot's description is copied from Bullon, (Hist. Nat. dcs Oi3.,vi. 

 p. 539, 1789,) who, however, copies from Marcgrave. Caprimulr/us varie^atu*, 

 Vieill., appears to be the same bird. 



The term " Jaspeado," applied to hJs bird by Azara, appears to mean simply 

 " marbled" (Connelly and Higgins' Dictionary of the Spanish and English lan- 

 guages, ii. p. 232, Quarto, Madrid, 1798) ; its latinization into "jaspideus," 

 which appears to have been done by Merrem, is of very doubtful correctness, 

 and calculated to convey to ears accustomed to the English language, the erro- 

 neous idea that the bird is the color of ihe stone known as jasper, which would 

 be taken to mean in the generality of cases a reddish brown or liver color ; or 

 worse, according to the classic meaning of the word jaspis or jasper, (hence 

 jaspideus,) "a stone of a green color,"' (vide Latin dictionaries.) 



21. Chordfliles acuius, (Gm.)

All these names are synonymes. The acumination at the tips of the shafts of 

 the tail feathers, from which the specific name of this bird is derived, affords a 

 character by which it is easily recognized, when present. But this is by no 

 means constantly the case, though when not observable the ends of the shafts 

 of the feathers are frequently abruptly terminated, and appear as if broken off. 

 This fact, and the very indifferent character of Buffon's figure, (PI. Enl., 732,) 

 are sufficient reasons that this bird has not been readily recognized, and that 

 it has been several times described under different names by very able and 

 learned authors. 



Caprimulgus pruinosus, Tschudi, is this bird. In Fauna Peruana, Cabanis 

 erroneously refers that species to Caprimulgus aemitorquaius, Gm., having been 

 influenced probably by the Prince de Wied's description of the bird, which he 

 supposed to be the latter, (Beitrage, iii. p. 330.) This description applies, 

 however, to Caprimulgus brasilianus. Gm., and not to C. semitorquatus, which 

 belongs to another genus.

Obs. — Each of the distinguished naturalists above cited founds his genus on 

 Caprimulgus diurmis, De Wied, Reise nach Bras., ii. p. 174, (1821,) which ap- 

 pears to be identical with "Del Nacunda" of Azara, Apunt., ii. p. 544, on the 

 faith of which Vieillot named the species Caprimulgus Nacunda, in Nouv. Diet., 

 X. p. 240, (1817.) I am acquainted with one species only of this genus, 

 which inhabits South America, and is that upon which it is founded : 

 _ 1. Podager nacunda, (Vieill.) Temm , PI. col. 182. 



23. Genus Lurocalis, nobis, nov. gen. 



Bill depressed, broad at base and suddenly compressed to the point, which is 

 hooked and acute ; nostrils basal, aperture.slightly elevated, bristles rudimental 

 or none, mandibles somewhat dilated at base, gape ample. Wings long, pointed, 

 reaching to the end of the tail or beyond ; first and second (usually the second) 

 primaries longest. Tail short, truncate. Tarsi short, feathered in front to the 

 toes, naked behind. General form of head and body broad and robust. Wings 

 and tail without white, throat with a white angular uninterrupted semicollar. 



Obs. — Of this new genus I have seen two species, both South American : 



1. rjurocalisNattererii,['Y%v[iva..,)V\. col. 107. 



2. Lurocalis semitorquatis, (Gm.,) Podager Gouldii, Gray, Gen., pi. 18. 



24. Lurocalis semitorguatis, (Gm.) 



1. Caprimulgus semitorqualis. Gm., Syst. Nat., ii. p. 1031,(1788,) a name 

 given by Gmelin on the faith of the "White collared Goatsucker" of Latham, 

 Gen. Syn., ii. pt. 2, p. 599, (17'83,) who copies from " Le petit Engoulevent 

 tachete de Cayenne" of Bufifon, Hist. Nat. des Ois., vi. p. 540, (1779,) PI. Enl., 734. 



2. Podager Gouldii. G. R. Gray, Genera of Birds, pi. 18,— figured only, no 

 description published. 



3. These names are probably synonymes. 



In endeavoring to ascertain the genus to which 0. semitorquatus, Gm., should 

 be referred, it must be admitted, that if we depend on Buffoon's short description, 

 as above, and that of Gmelin, which is shorter, the bird may as readily be con- 

 sidered as belonging to Chordeiles as to any other genus. Buffon, who describes 

 from a specimen " dans le cabinet de M. Manduyt," which he probably figures 

 also, says that it resembles Marcgrave's Ibiyau, (C. hrasilianus,) "par lalongeur 

 relative de ses ailes et par ses autres proportions." In the latter (vide art. 20 

 of this paper,) the wings and tail are nearly equal, and this is also the casein 

 Bufifon's plate, (PI. Enl., 734.) This does not agree with one of the characters 

 of Lurocalis, but in all other respects the bird figured by Buffon has every 

 appearance of a bird of this genus, and, moreover, so much resembles the P. 

 Gouldii, that 1 have little doubt it is the same bird. 



Upon comparing a specimen of the P. Gouldii (which is not a rare bird) with 

 Bufifon's plate, the thickness of the head and body, the truncated tail, the gene- 

 ral colors of the body above and below, and especially the markings of the 

 wings and tail, present such a strong similarity, that it appears to me impos- 

 sible to avoid the conclusion that it is the species intended to be represented, 

 notwithstanding the comparative shortness of the wings. 



If we compare with the same plate a specimen of the C. hrasilianus, which is 

 referred to it by De Wied, we will quite agree with him that it is "sehr schlecht," 




190 [April, 



(very bad.) Buffou's name, " Engoulcvent tachete," is quite appropriate for 

 this species. 



Temminck seems therefore to have been correct (PI. col., vi. p. 78) in ap- 

 plying the name C. semitorquatus to Buff. PI. Enl., 734. 



25. Lurocalis Nitttererii. (Temm.) PI. col., 107. 



This bird is larger than the preceding, and may be distinguished from it 

 not only by its size, but by the greater extent of the rufous color of the lower 

 parts of the body. 



In the present species, not only the ventral region and abdomen are of this 

 color, but it extends upwards almost to the breast. This difference may be 

 seen by comparing PI. col. 107 and PI. Enl. 734. In other respects the two 

 birds present considerable similarity, and may be sexes of the same species. 



26. Genus Steatornis. Humboldt, Obs. de Zool., ii. p. 141. 



I mention the curious bird which constitutes this genus for the purpose of 

 completing the notices inserted in this paper of all the American genera of 

 Capriraulgidie, and list of all the American species which I have seen. The 

 only known species of this genus, several specimens of which are in the col- 

 lection of this Academy, is, 



1. Steatornis caripensis. Humb., Nouv. Ann. de Mus. Paris, 1834, p. 321, pi. 15. 



The Chairman presented a statement from the Treasurer, George W. 

 Carpenter, Esq., announcing that he had received from the executors

 vested by him for the benefit of the Publication fund of the Journal of 

 the Academy, as directed in the will.

 Dr. Morton, President in the Chair. 



A letter dated Breslau, Sept. 2, 1850, from the Royal L. C. Academy 

 of Sciences was read, acknowledging the receipt of Proceedings, Vol. 

 4, No. 8, Vol. 5, Nos. 2 and 3 ; also a second letter from the same,

Dr. Leidy read a paper describing new species of Entozoa, &c., en- 

 titled " Contributions to Helminthology ;" which was referred to Dr. 

 Haliowell, Dr. Hand, and Dr. Bridges. 



Dr. Leicly after some general remarks upon the transplantation of animai 

 tissues, stated that about five months ago Dr. Horner removed from a female 

 a scirrhus mamma, a portion of which, at his request, he took home for micro- 

 scopic examination. In structure it proved to be composed of fibrous tissue 

 and nucleated, elongated, or caudated cells. After the examination, about four 

 hours subsequent to the removal of the tumor from the woman, Dr. L. inserted 

 four pieces of the tumor, each half an inch long by one-eighth of a ninch broad 

 and thick, beneath the integument of the back of a large frog. Three of the 

 fragments were pushed forward to the vicinity of the ear. In a few days suc- 

 ceeding the operation, the incision of the skin perfectly cicatrized. 



Yesterday upon killing the frog, and opening the skin along the back, it was 

 found that three of the scirrhus fragments had formed a vascular attachment 

 with the integument, and for one half their length had had a large develop- 

 ment of capillaries in them. Two of the fragments had also formed a vascular 

 attachment to each other throughout their length. The fourth fragment had 

 formed no attachment with the tissues of the frog, and had remained ap- 

 arently unchanged. Upon examining the fragments with the microscope, it 

 was found that the caudated cells had been entirely transformed into fibrous 

 tissue. 



Dr. L. exhibited a portion of the frog with the fragments of cancer attached. 

 The net-work of blood vessels pervading the pieces was beautifully distinct to 

 the naked eye.

The Librarian announced that the Portrait of 3Ir. George Ord, which

Mr. Mason after observing that he had been " for more than twenty

 ing observations of interest, on some plants of Burmah. 



" On looking over Griffith's Medical Botany, which was recently put into my 

 hands, it seems to me that our knowledge is very imperfect in that department

as well as in some others. Tlie idant which produces the Siamese gamboge, for 

 instance, is oonfes6e<lly unknown. In the southern parts of thesu Provinces, 

 near the Siamese bonndary, there is a tree whicli produces a species of gamboge 

 that cannot be distinguished from the gamboge that is brought from Siam ; and 

 in an article which was read before the Asiatic Society of Bengal, tliree or four 

 years ago, I showed that that tree was Garcinia eUiptira, a species named and 

 described as a species imperfectly known by Dr. Wight ; who was not at all 

 aware that it produced gamboge. There can, I think, be little doubt, but tliat 

 this is the tree which produces the Siamese gamboge. This was so clear to the 

 members of the Asiatic Society, that tlie Secretary wrote me, ' Our best botan- 

 ists here consider that you have hit on the true tree at last.' Again, gum-kino 

 was exported several years ago in considerable quantities from Maulmain, 

 brought overland from the Shan States, and is produced, so far as I can ascer- 

 tain, from Sterocarpus WaUichii; yet this tree has no place in our Medical 

 Floras. 



I suspect that a large part of the crude camphor exported from Ciiina, and- 

 which is always referred to Camphora officinarum, is the product of one of the 

 commonest weeds in Eastern India and China. In the early years of my resi- 

 dence at Yavoy, the Burmese pointed out to me a weed with leaves like muUen, 

 which when bruised emits a strong odor of camphor. From it they told me 

 they had been in the habit of distilling, from time immemorial, as good canv 

 phor, except that it was not so pure, as that which they saw in my medicine 

 chest. Some of the Chinese settlers also say that the same plant abounds in. 

 China, and that camphor is made from it there. Mr. O'Riley, a sugar manu- 

 facturer at Amerst, made more than a hundred pounds of camphor from this 

 weed, a few years ago, and sent a part of it to Calcutta for examination ; and 

 the official authorities reported on his specimens. ' In its refined form, it is 

 identical in all its properties with Chinese camphor.' Mr. O'Riley sent flower- 

 ing specimens of the plant to Calcutta, and they were forwarded thence to Dr. 

 Voigt of Serampore, and the report added : ' Dr. Voigt states that it belongs to 

 De Caudolle's genus Blnmea, and is, so far as he can see, a new species.' Not 

 having books to enable me to determine the question of its being a new species 

 or not, I left it in abeyance until I procured De Candolle's Prodromus, three 

 or four years ago, and I was soon satisfied then, that it is the same plant as 

 that which appeared in Wallich's catalogue, as Conyza grandis, and which De 

 CandoUe has described as Blumea grandis. Wallich's specimens were from 

 Tavoy, without flowers, and De CaudoUe describes the leaf* as nine inches long 

 with the petiole, by three wide, serrated, and bearing on the petiole five or six 

 remote linear acute lobes ; which corresponds precisely to some specimens of 

 our camphor plant ; but it does not correspond to any other species of Blumea 

 in the Provinces. This plant probably covers more of the surface of the Ten* 

 asserim Provinces than any other weed. Wherever the trees are cut down to 

 clear the land, it springs up so thick that scarcely any thing else can live with 

 it ; so that an old clearing looks in the distance like afield under cultivation, 

 A letter was read from the llojal Society of London, dated Feb.

 Vice-President Wetherill in the Chair. 



Upon taking the chair, Mr. Wetherill announced the decease of the 

 President of the Society, Dr. Samuel George Morton, which took place 

 at his residence in Arch Street yesterday morning, after an illness of 

 only four days. The present meeting had been convened for the pur- 

 pose of expressing the feelings of the members on this melancholy oc- 

 casion. 



Dr. Bridges in some very appropriate remarks on the character of 

 the deceased, adverted to his long connexion with the institution, al- 

 most from its origin; his close adherence to its interests under the 

 varied and trying circumstances through which it had passed; having 

 successively filled its different of&ees, he had become the ornament of 

 its prosperity, and died at last its President. 



Dr. Charles D. Meigs expressed his deep and sincere regret for the 

 loss of Dr. Morton, and bore testimony to his great private worth, his 

 eminent scientific and professional abilities, and offered the following 

 Preamble and Resolutions : 



The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia being called upon 

 to deplore the loss of its late respected and beloved President, Dr. 

 Samuel George Morton, and considering that event as of deep interest 

 to the whole Republic of Letters; feeling that the eminent attainments 

 of their late Chief in the various departments of Literature and Science 

 entitled him to the respect and admiration of all the friends of learn- 

 ing; that his consistent course of virtue, his liberality and urbanity, 

 adorned and illustrated the Academy over which he presided, and re- 

 flected honor upon its name, are deeply impressed by the irreparable 

 loss they, in common with all the friends of the Natural Sciences, have 

 sustained by his death : Therefore, 



Resolved, That this Academy esteem the life of their late President 

 to be to all men a shining example of earnest and successful zeal in the 

 pursuit and promotion of learning, in the cultivation of wisdonfand 

 virtue, and the practice of the highest liberality and benevolence. 



Resolved, That the Academy do cherish and revere the memory of 

 their deceased illustrious President, and that in order to commemorate 




204 [May, 



his name, a marble tablet with a suitable inscription be placed in the 

 Hall of the Academy. 



Kesolve'l, That with heartfelt sympathy we present to his bereaved 

 family this espvessioD of our admiration of him whose death deprives 

 both them and our common country and the world, of one of the most 

 meritorious of men. 



The I'reamble and Resolutions were unanimously adopted. 



Pr. J. C. Fisher offered the following, which was also unanimously 

 adopted : 



AesoIvc(7, That a Committee be appointed to select a member to pre- 

 pare a biographical memoir of our late President, Dr. Morton, and that 

 the kindred societies in this city, of which he was a member, be invited 

 to be present when it is read. 



The Committee under this resolution was then appointed as follows : 

 Dr. Jas. C. Fisher, Dr. R. Bridges, Dr. J. K. Mitchell, and Dr. 

 Leidy. 



On motion of Dr. Bridges, the Resolutions were ordered to be pub- 

 lished in four daily papers of this city. 



Dr. Horner oifered the following, which was adopted. 



Resolved, That when we adjourn it shall be to meet in this Hall on 

 Sunday afternoon next, 18th inst., at 3 o'clock, to attend, as a body, 

 the funeral of our late lamented President. 



Dr. Mitchell moved that the Chairman and Secretaries and three 

 other members, be a committee to wait upon the family of Dr. Morton 

 and testify the sympathy of the Society ; which was adopted, and the 

 following members appointed : Dr. Mitchell, Mr. Peterson, and Dr. 

 Horner.

Dr. Leidy remarked that in a recent visit to Dr. Wilson, near Newark, Dela- 

 ware, while rambling in a neighboring wood, upon turning over a log, lie dis- 

 covered a mole cricket, ( Grillo-ialpa Americana,) standing very quietly at the 

 mouth of a hole. Upon taking it up, the animal exhibited no signs of move- 

 ment, tliougli perfectly fresh and life-like in appearance. He took it home 

 and next morning examined it, and found it still presenting no signs of life. 

 Every part of the insect was perfect, not even the autennse being broken. 

 Upon feeling it, it was very hard and resistant, and on making an incision through 

 the thorax, it exhaled a fungoid odor. The insect had been invaded with a 

 parasitic fungus, which everywhere filled the animal, occupying the position 

 of all the soft tissues, even unto the tarsal-joints. It formed a yellowish or 

 cream-colored compact mass, and in the abdomen enclosed iu its centre the 

 stomachal teeth of the insect. 



Examined microscopically, the fungus matter was found to consist of a myce- 

 lium of filaments for the most part simple, but occasionally branched, and el- 

 liptical or globular sporular bodies, averaging the l-2333rd in. in diameter.

Mr. Isaac Lea stated that he had visited within a few days, the lo" 

 eality whence Dr. J. Y. Schelley had procured the reptilian fossil. It 

 was a calcareous conglomerate, the rock being in place and forming a wall 

 on the side of the road, and was not a boulder as had been supposed. 

 No further traces of bones had since been discovered. Mr. Lea 

 exhibited a specimen of the rock, and stated that he had now deter- 

 mined to name the fossil C7ey>sy5au/-w.sjjeu/t.syZyo/i('cus, from the pecu- 

 liar form of the vertebra, which resembled an hour-glass in shape. 



On leave granted, Mr. Vaux moved that Mr. Pearsall be added to the 

 Committee appointed to select a member to prepare a biographical 

 memoir of the late Dr. Morton. Adopted. 



On motion of 3Ir. Vaux, it was also resolved that a committee of five 

 be appointed to select a suitable design for a tablet to the memory of 

 Dr. Morton, to be placed in the Hall, and to carry out the resolution 

 relating to this subject, adopted at the meeting of the Society held on 

 the l(3th inst. — Committee: Mr. Yaux, Dr. Bridges, Mr. Wetherill, Dr. 

 3IeigS5 3Ir. Phillips. On motion of Dr. Leidy, the Curators were added 

 to the Committee.

Vice-President Wetherill in the Chair. 



The Library Committee, to whom was referred the communication 

 from the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, requesting the deposit with 

 them of the Paris Moniteur belonging to the Academy, reported " that 

 as said papers constitute pirt of a series in connection with the docu- 

 mentary History of the French Revolution, it would be inexpedient to 

 separate them, and they would therefore respectfully decline complying 

 with the request of the Historical Society." Adopted. 



Dr. Fisher, from the Committee on the subject, reported that Dr. 

 Charles D. Meigs had been unanimously chosen by the Committee to 

 prepare a biographical memoir of Dr. Morton, and that Dr. Meigs had 

 accepted the appointment. 



The Committee to whom was referred the following paper by Dr. 

 Leidy, reported in favor of publication in Proceedings.

Remarlcs. — I was on the point of considering this entozoon as a Monostomum 

 when I was led to examine it more carefully by the observation of Dujardin,* 

 that it had been described by authors under the name of M. ellipticum, because 

 the ventral acetabulum is very small and difficult to perceive. The latter I 

 found without difficulty in the position stated in the description.

Mr. Cassin read a communication from C!ol. Geo. A. McCall, U. S. A., 

 entitled •' Some account of Birds found in Western Texas and New 

 Mexico, with descriptions of new species •" which was intended for 

 publication in the Proceedings, and referred to the following commit- 

 tee : Mr. Cas<in, Dr. Watson and Mr. E. Harris. 



Dr. J. K. Mitchell exhibited a specimen of a fungus growing upon 

 a piece of decayed white-oak wood, which when recent is so luminous 

 as to attract insects to it at night. 



Dr. Leidy remarked, that it liad occurred to him whilst examining the mole 

 cricket, referred to at the meeting of May 20th, that if the fragments of the 

 insect were placed under favorable conditions, the fungoid matter in the in- 

 terior of the insect might develope itself into an external form of fungus. He 

 accordingly placed them in a small glass case, with some moist sphagnum, and 

 allowed them to remain until the juesent time. Dr. L. exhibited the glass case 

 with the fragments, each having sprouting out of it one, two, or three, elon- 

 gated, conical stripes of a cream color, from 3 lines to 1 inch long, and from i 

 a line to IJ lines in diameter. Dr. Leidy continued, in examining insects for 

 entophyta and entozoa, he had found the hemiptera remarkably free from 

 them, which he considers an important fact. Those insects which eat large 

 quantities of vegetable solid food, especially such as eat decaying substances, 

 are very much infected with parasites. The spontaneous generation of en- 

 tophyta and entozoa finds but few advocates at the present day. Late re- 

 searches lead us to suspect that many, if not all, entozoa, pass part of their 

 life out of the animals in which they are known as parasites, under forms 

 different from those when within the animals. 



The entrance of the parasites into other animals is effected probably in two 

 ways : with the food -of the latter, or by boring from the exterior. The former 

 method is probably the most frequent in jerial animals ; and both methods are 

 fi-equent in aquatic animals, because, in the latter case, the water affords a 

 good vehicle for the approach of the parasites to any part of the body of th6' 

 animals to be infected. 



As hemipterous insects suck the juices only of plants or animals, through a 

 delicate proboscis, they are placed under circumstances the most favorable of 

 all animals to avoid taking in with their food, ova, spores, or developed ani- 

 mals and plants of a parasitic character ; whilst insects like passalus, crickets, 

 etc., or julus amongst niyriapoda, from their eating decaying substances, 

 swallowing large m.orsels of such food, are very apt to take in parasites. 




1851.] 211 



Frequently I have detected adhering to insects and annelida, while living, 

 cryptogamic sporules, which under favorable circumatances, before or after the 

 death of the animal, undergo development into the perfect plant. House-flies, 

 and especially earth worms, are very liable to the growth of Achlya upon 

 them, and sometimes I have even detected the growth of the latter upon the 

 surface of earth worms still living. 



Mr. Lea stated that during his recent visit to Readiag, Penn., he had

 hibited, and also a specimen froni^aDOther unrecorded locality, the Yel-

 dated Philadelphia, June lUth, 1851, transmitting a resolution of thanks 

 from that Society for an invitatiga. to visit the Museum of the 

 Academy. 



Dr. Leidy stated he had repeated the experiment of introducing cancerous 

 matter beneath the integument of a frog, which was first announced to the 

 Academy, May 6th. 



The cancerous matter was a fragment of encephaloid, taken from a female after 

 death, by Dr._ Henry II. Smith. It was almost as soft as cerebral substance. 

 Beneath the microscope it exhibited a structure of very delicate organic cells, 

 containing numerous granules and one or two nuclei, 



A portion |ths of an inch long, by ith of an inch broad, was inserted under 

 the skin of the back of a frog, on May 13th, 5-4 hours after its removal from the 

 body of the female. Tliis frog, still living. Dr. L. exhibited to the members, 

 and by an incision through the integument, presented to view the fragment of 

 cancer which had been introduced, and which had not only formed a vascular 

 attachment to the integument, but for one-half itself was of a fine red color from 

 the net-work of capillaries which had become developed within it. The frag- 

 ment had not increased in size. A number of its structural cells remained un* 

 changed, but others had broken down into granular masses. 



Dr. L. observed, the experiment not only proved the independent vitality of ^ 

 tissues, which was generally admitted, but also rendered it exceedingly probable 

 that cancer was inoculable, for, as in the experiments, the cancerous fragments 

 continued to live when introduced into cold-blooded animals, they would pro- 

 bably not only continue to live when introduced into warm-blooded animals, 

 but would grow or increase in size. 



Dr. Zantzinger announced to the Society the decease of William — 

 Hcmbel, Esq.. which occurred on the 12th inst.,at his residence in this - 

 city, at the advanced age of S8 years. His long connection with the^-' 

 Institution, his liberality to it on many occasions, his position as its-'^ 

 President for nine years, and his scientific and literary acquirements,—' 

 eminently entitled him to honorable mention on the present oeca- '

The following Preamble and Resolutions were then oflFered on the 

 part of Mr. George Ord, and unanimously adopted. 



The Academy, deeply sensible of the death of their venerable mem- 

 ber, are impelled by a sense of duty, to give formal expression of their 

 sorrow at the loss of one, who, during the period of twenty-six years, was 

 zealously active in his exertions to advance those branches of know- 

 ledge for the cultivation of which this Institution was created. It is, 

 therefore, 



Resolced, That the Academy, in mourning the departure of a friend 

 whose long life was signalized by his devotion to scientific pursuits, 

 derive consolation from the reflection that their steadfast benefactor 

 was as conspicuous for his efficient benevolence, as for his integrity and 

 social virtues. 



Resoh-ed, That a copy of the foregoing be transmitted to the family 

 of the deceased.

2. CvANErs, Linn. .Marsh Hawk. 



The Harrier I found in very great numbers on the plains stretching from the 

 Pecos river to the Apache mountains, in February ; whereas in October follow- 

 iag but I'tfw were seen in the same region ; stragglers were, however, met with 

 in the lower plains everywhere. 



Atuene, Boie. 



3. A. Hypcg/KA, Bonap. [Cunicdlaria, Gmel.'] Burrowing Owl. 



This singular little owl I found, occasionally, along the Rio Grande, from Val 

 Verde to Santa Fe, and quite abundant in the Valley of Las Vegas. It was 

 abroad at all hours of the day, and often amused me with its odd manners ; 

 taking wing at the near approach of my horse, and again alighting at the dis- 

 tance of a few yards, when it would face toward me and mj,ke, aim "st uniformly, 

 three distinct and formal bows, with a mock solemnity that was irresistibly 

 ludicrous. BetAveen sunset and dark, however, I always observed them to be 

 most numerous ; and at this hour they were also more shy and less ceremonious- 

 There is a general impression, that this owl habitually takes up its abode in 

 the dominions of the"i'raeVie Bog" where, in company with the Rattlesnake, 

 it feeds freely upon the young marmots. That it has been found, in some regions 

 in the dog towns., seems to be established on reliable authority ; indeed I have 

 conversed with more than one person who was a witness to the fact. Still, I 

 am rather disposed to look upon the fact as an accidental occurrence, than as 

 an instinctive or positive habit of the bird. My own experience, too, tends to 

 anything but the corroboration of this testimony ; for I have met with Jli/jougita 

 in various places, from Fort Gibson, in Arkansas, to the Rocky Mountains, and 

 it has never, in one instance, been my fortune to find it in company with the 

 Marmot. 



On the high, dry plains between the Pecos river and the Apache mountains, 

 I rode for days through the dog towns, as they are called, and did not see a 

 single owl, although the whole land seemed vivacious with marmots. Again : 

 both on the east and west of the Valley of Las Vegas, where, as already ob- 

 served, this owl is found in great numbers, there are within a few miles of the 

 edge of the valley, on the high dry plains, extensive settlements of the marmots ; 

 and }-et I never saw an owl about their burrows, in repeatedly passing through 

 them. Nor is the most usual food of this owl found on high sandy plains : but 

 in low lands, near water courses ; and here I have always found him most nu- 

 merous. With a view to satisfy my own mind on this point, I studied these 

 animals closely, on this expedition ; in the northern parts of New Mexico, in the 

 months of August and September: and in the Apache country in February and 

 October. 



It may not, perhaps, be amiss to remark here, with respect to the reported 

 hibernating habits of the marmot, [Arctomys Ludoviciana,] that on the high 

 plains of the Limpia, and also on those among the Apache mountains, these 

 frolicksome little fellows made their appearance above ground, in crowds, soon 

 after sunrise, and remained abroad frisking and barking, until about 2 o'clock 

 P. M. in the month of February, although the nights and mornings were cold —

the thermometer sometimes indicating a temperature 1 0° or 1 2° below the freez - 

 ing point at sunrise. What maybe their habits in higher latitudes, where the 

 earth is for long periods covered with deep snows, I have never had an oppor- 

 tunity to observe in winter.

■i: Was first seen on the Pao Grande, about GO miles below El Paso del Norte. 

 Here they were abundant in the month of March, and were usually collected near 

 the river bank, before sunset, in search of insects; when they proved themselves 

 expert in the pursuit, darting from the top of tall bushes to seize their prey upon 

 the wing, and returning again, in the manner of true fly-catchers. In May, they 

 made their appearance at Santa Fi; — but were not numerous. Immediately on 

 their arrival, they prepared their nests ; one of these, built in the gravel bank of 

 an arroyo seco or dry creek, I examined. It was composed entirely of dry grass ; 

 but it was well formed, having high walls of considerable thickness, and con- 

 tained six eggs of a marine-blue color. The hole in which the nest was found, 

 and which was in the side of a perpendicular bank, about five feei from ttte bot- 

 tom, was four inches in diameter and ten in depth. Each brood (generally 

 seven or eight, including the old birds) seemed to keep united during the 

 summer. About the first of September, they began to move off".

19. C. Stelleri, Gmel. Steller's Jay. 



Was rather common along the mountain sides, between Santa Fe and Las

20. C. tJLTBAMABiNOS, Botiop. Ultramarine Jay. 



This, Jay, also, was seen in the same range with the preceding, during summer. 

 '21. C. Cassinii, iVbftw, Cassin'sJay. 



Length 11 7-lOths inches; alar stretch 18 inches. Upper parts slate blue ; front 

 and crown darker, almost black ; chin and throat grayish white ; cheeks and 

 sides of neck light blue ; wings same as back, the quills dusky on the inner vanes ; 

 below slate color, lighter than above ; iris dark brown ; bill and feet black. 



This Jay first made its appearance, about Santa F6, in April, and remained 

 there, in considerable numbers, during the summer. It nested and passed the 

 midday in the highest mountains, coming down their sides upon the hills to feed, 

 morning and evening. At these times they moved in large, loose flocks, alter- 

 nately alighting to pick up an insect or a lizard, and again passing to the front ; 

 keeping up, the while, a regular cry, in a rather low plaintive tone, very different 

 from the Blue Jay. In this way they generally passed some time before sunset 

 amongst the scrubby white cedars of the hills, and then returned to the moun- 

 tains to roost. The bird from which the above description was taken, had, when 

 killed, just swallowed, entire, a " horned froff," or lizard, [Aff^ma Cornuta] 

 2i inches in length. 




1851.] 217 



I desire to name this species, which is believed to be hitherto undescribed, 

 after Mr. John Cassin, of Philadelphia, to whose knowledge and indefatigable 

 industry the Academy, of which I have the honor to be a corresponding mem- 

 ber, is so greatly indebted in the department of Ornithology. 

 NuciFRAGA, Briss. 



23. N. Columbiana, Wils. Clark's Crow, or American Nutcracker. 



The habits of this bird I found, in some respects, resembling the preceding; 

 the character of its flight, however, is quite different, partaking somewhat of the 

 undulating motion of the larger woodpeckers. I met with several flocks in the 

 high pine forests east of Santa Fe, and on the Taos mountain. 



CoRvus, Linn. 



24. C. CORAX, Linn, Raven. 



The Raven I found everywhere throughout Texas and New Mexico. 



25. C. Americancs, And. Common Crow. 



This relative of the foregoing, I met almost as universally in the regions just 

 named. 



It has been remarked by our most distinguished Ornithologist, Wilson, in 

 speaking of the Raven, that " it is a remarkable fact, that where they (the ravens) 

 so abound, the common crow seldom makes its appearance j being intimidated, 

 it is conjectured, by the superior size and strength of the former, or by an antipa- 

 thy which the two species manifest towards each other." This conclusion I 

 believe to be an error, into which this close observer and most accurate delinea- 

 tor was doubtless led, by some singularity of circumstances that does not often 

 obtain : for I have generally found rather a social feeling existing between these 

 congeners, arising probably, from the gregarious disposition of each, and the 

 similarity of their food. On reference to my copy of Wilson's work, I find the 

 following note on the margin, which it may not be altogether amiss to transcribe : 

 " At Fort Gibson, in the Cherokee country, Arkansas Ter., the ravens were 

 more numerous than in any other part of the country I have ever visited ; the 

 crows also were very abundant there. During a period of two years and a half 

 that I was at that post, I daily saw the ravens and crows feeding amicably on the 

 same ground, and perched upon the same trees. I have also observed the same 

 thing here. — Dated, Fort Scott, Osage country, March, 1845." 



I may say further, that the same observations were made in Texas and N. 

 Mexico. 



Pica, Briss. 



26. P. MELANOLEUCA, Vieill. Common Magpie. 



One pair of these birds was seen near Turkey Creek, in Western Texas, early 

 in November, in the latitude of about 29° 15'. And the fact is only mentioned 

 on account of the rare occurrence of meeting a Magpie so far South. A storm 

 from the North had been prevailing on the plains for three days, and had no doubt 

 brought them with it, from the upper country. During the previous winter none 

 had been seen in N. Mexico, as low as 36° lat. ^

 on the whole route from Lavaca to Santa Fe. The song, I think, ia superior to 

 that of S. LuDOviciANA. The only place at which I heard it was at lianla Fe, 

 in the spring months.

I first met with this bird on the Rio Grande, between Santa Fe and Canada, 

 in September, when several small flocks were seen. I again found them on the 

 Rio Puerco, in October. Their note and flight reminded me at once of our D. 

 Oryzivora; but I found their flesh very inferior in delicacy and flavor to the 

 latter.

38. 0. ? 0CC1DEKTAL18.* Probably the young of a species not heretofore 

 described. 



The bird from which the following description was taken, was shot near Santa 




1851.] 219 



Fe, in the month of July. It had. in some respects, the appearance of an adalt 

 bird, or at least a bird of the preceding year, although its general markiogj, to 

 jadge from analogy, would indicate a young bird. Yet, judging from the firm- 

 ness of its bones, appearance of its bill and a slight abrasion of the ends of 

 the tail feathers, I did not, at the time, take it to be a young bird. 



Its length (when killed) was 7 T-lOths inches; alar stretch II inches ; wing, 

 from flexure, 3 7-lOths; above, light-brown, each feather being dark-dusky 

 near the tip, the extreme tip while — giving the appearance of a mixture of 

 light and dark-brown, thickly speckled with white ; in this respect resembling 

 the young of the Shore Lark; the greater and lesser wing coverts broadly 

 edged with yellowish-white, and tipped with pure white, forming two distinct 

 bars, most apparent when the wing is extended ; the second primary longest, 

 the third shorter than the first, the outer vane of the latter white ; remaining 

 ■wing feathers edged with whitish, broadest on the tertials ; tail of twelve 

 feathers, even, the two middle ones light-brown, edged with whitish, the 

 remainder dark-dusky, the two exterior ones being white on the outer vanes ; 

 all the underparts pale brownish-white, most clear at the lower extreme : bill 

 slender and slightly curved, of a born color above, and lighter below ; eye- 

 brows extending back of the eyes, whitish ; irides dark hazel : legs and I'eet 

 nearly black ; hind nail longer than the toe. 



The difference between this bird and the young of the Shore Lark, is in the 

 diflFerent dimensions, and in the whole of the under parts being whitish ; but 

 more particularly in the length and shape of the bill, which is longer, more 

 Blender, and rather more curved above than that of the Shore Lark, either 

 young or old. 



It is believed to be of a species of the genus Otocoris, hitherto unknown to 

 science. 



Carpodacus, Kaup. 

 [Ertthrospiza, Bonap.'] 

 39. C. Frontalis, Say. Crimson-Fronted Finch. 



I found this charming little finch abundant at Santa Fe, where they com- 

 menced nesting in March, although the weather was still wintry, and so con- 

 tinued, with frequent snow storms, for more than a month. Notwithstanding 

 this, the song of the male failed not to cheer his mate, during incubation, with 

 the liveliest melody. The notes often reminded me of the soft trill of the 

 House Wren, and as often of the clear warble of the canary. The males of 

 the last year, though mated and apparently equally happy and quite as 

 assiduous as their seniors, were not yet in full plumage, having linle or 

 nothing of the red colors that mark the adult birds. 



The nests, which were stuck into every cranny about the eves and porticos 

 of the houses throughout town, were variously composed, of dry gra??, fine 

 roots, horse-hair, long pieces of cotton twine, or strips of old calico ; in fine, 

 of countless odds and ends, that were picked up about the yards ; these were 

 curiously and firmly interwoven, so as to make a warm and comfortable abode 

 for the new comers. Eggs, four or five, pale blue, slightly marked on the 

 larger end. The young are able to fly by the middle or latter part of April. 

 A secoud brood, and, in some esse?, I believe, a third w.is raised during the 




220 [June, 



summer; as not a few of them continued to incubate until some time in the 

 month of August. Before the latter part of September, however, nearly all of 

 them had disappeared from about Santa F6. 

 40. C. 0B8CURD3, Nobis. Duskj Finch. 



Length (when killed) G inches ; wing 2 8-lOth inches ; front, crown and back 

 dark brownish-ash, striped with dark dusky-brown ; wings and tail dusky- 

 brown, each feather edged with brownish-white ; the greater and lesser wing 

 coverts more broadly edged with the same, making two faint bars on the wing; 

 all the under parts dull white, striped with dark dusky-brown ; fail slightlj 

 forked; bill slightly curved, upper mandible duaky, lower madible paler, 

 inclining to yellow ; iris hazel ; feet dark-dusky. This was the female. 



The male, though with lighter colors, did not appear to differ greatly from 

 the female; nor could I, at a short distance, distinguish the usual tiuge of red 

 that marks this genus. 



The song of the male consists of a few pleasing notes, without the volume 

 or compass of voice of the preceding species. I was much disappointed ia 

 not being able to secure the male. I saw but one pair ; and, after following 

 them for some time and observing their habits, having them in line, I shot 

 the female, from my horse, with a pistol, whereupon the male took wing, and 

 eluded all further search. The same ground was repeatedly hunted afterwards, 

 but without success. This was near Santa Fe.

This species is the only one of the family that I met with on this expedition. 

 It was very common in N. Mexico during the summer. On the Rio Grande fur- 

 ther south, I found on a former occasion, between Matamoras and Camargo, five 

 species, — viz. : Z. amabilis, Z. leucoptera, C. passerina, E. Carolinensis and C. 

 iolitariat Most of them seem to confine themselves to the warmer latitudes. 



Orttx, Steph. 



44. 0. ViHGiNiANA, Limt. Common Quail, or American Partridge. 



Of four species of Odontophorimt found in Western Texas, the habitat of each 

 of which is confined to an almost distinct locality or region, this was the first met 

 with on this occasion. It was extremely numerous about San Antonio ; and 

 thence, beyond the settlements to the San Pedro or Devil's River, (a distance of 

 170 miles, westwardly, by the route travelled to the Rio Grande,) it was more or 

 less common. This region, it is worthy of note, is by far the best on the whole 

 route to El Paso ; (a distince by the trail of 673 m.) That is to say, it is a better 

 watered country, has a richer soil, and produces spontaneously a greater variety 

 of grasses and otl er plants, whose seeds afford abundant and nutritious food to 




1851.] 221 



all kinds of game. I discovered no difference in the appearance or habits of this 

 bird, here, from those of the common quail of the Atlantic States. 



Cyrtonyx, Gould. 

 45. C. Masskna, Gould. Massena Quail, or Partridge. 



This species was not seen before crossing the San Pedro : but it was not long 

 until it made its appearance in the waste and rocky region in which we then 

 entered. And from that time until we reached the Rio Pecos, a distance of 140 

 m., (westwardly by the route travelled,) it was frequently seen, though I should 

 not say It was very common. This region is a desert of great length from North 

 to South, our trail crossing it nearly at right angles. The general face of the 

 country is level, and consists of either a crumbling argillaceous limestone, or a 

 coarse grey sand, producing nothing but a sparse growth of sandplantg. Water 

 is found only at long intervals ; and except at these points there is but little 

 cover for game, and apparently less food, — the principal growth being Cacti — 

 of which the most common is C. arborescens ; yet here amongst projectingrock s 

 or on the borders of dry gullies, or in loose scrub, I found C. Massena in all the 

 beauty of his rich and varied plumage. 



The habits of this species are different from those of any other species of Part- 

 ridge that I have met with. They were in covies of from 8 to 12, and appeared 

 to be extremely simple, and affectionate in disposition. In feeding, they sepa- 

 rated but little, keeping up a social cluck all the time. They were so gentle as 

 to evince little or no alarm on the approach of man ; scarcely moving out of his 

 way as he passed; and only running off or flying a few yards when perhaps 

 half their numbers were laid low by a shot. This inclined me to think they 

 might with little difficulty be domesticated, although I found them, here, in a 

 boundless barren waste, and nowhere near the habitation of man. This trait of 

 gentleness is the very opposite of those strikingly manifested by the scaly part- 

 ridge, which I always observed to be, though found perchance in grounds as 

 little frequented as these, remarkably vigilant, shy, and difficult to approach. 

 The call or signal note of this specfes is peculiar. I never saw them after cross- 

 ing the Pecos river.

46. L. GAUBEtii,' ^u'fl. Gambel's Qnail, or Partridge. 



After losing sight of the last species, I did not fall in with this until we 

 reached the Limpia river, about 100 m. west of the Pecos. This b3autiful bird ; 

 whose habits in some respects bear more resemblance to the common partridge, 

 like that, seems to prefer a more genial and hospitable region. In this part of 

 the country, the Mesquite tree {A. glandulosa) is more or less common ; anJ 

 the Mesquite grass, and other plants bearing nutritious seeds, are abundant ■ 

 Here, this partridge increases rapidly in numbers, and becomes very fat. And 

 as I afterwards ascertained, is much disposed to seek the farms, if any be with- 

 in reach, and to cultivate the acquaintance of man. About the raacdo of .Mr. 

 White, near El Pasco, I found them very numerous ; and here in gangs of oo or 

 100, they resort, morning and evening, to the barn-yard, and feed around the 

 grain stacks in company with the poultry, where thej' receive their portioa, as 

 4t is scattered among them by the hand of the owner.

Callipepla, Waaler. 

 47. r. SQUAMMATA, WiKjlfr. Scalj Quail, or Partridge. 



This species I have met with, at dilferent times, throughout a more extended 

 regiou llian either of the last two, viz. : from Camargo, on the lower Rio Grandci 

 to Santa Fc. On the prfSPiit occasion they were more numerous between the 

 latter point and Don Ana than elsewhere. They seem to prefer the vicinity of 

 utUe greater water courses to interior tracts. They are much more wild than 

 either of the preceding, and being extremely watch ful and swift of foot, they 

 elude pursuit with surprising skill, scarcej^ resorting to flight, even in compa- 

 ratively open, sandy ground. They do not approach the settlements as much 

 a3 the last. For the table, all these species, however, possess in a high degree 

 the requisites of plump muscle and delicate flavor, ilassena is perhaps the best.

Tringa, lAnn. 



52. T. HiMANTOPUS, Bonap. Long-legged Sandpiper, 



I found a few birds of this species near San Elizario, in October. Their fa- 

 vorite range, however, does not extend far from the Gulf. On reference to my 

 notes, I find they were abundant about Corpus Christi, from September to March, 

 1845-'j ; at the termination of which period I left them still there. They were 

 exceedingly numerous about Matamoras, during the following winter, and were 

 served at the tables of the Hotels and Restaurants very prodigally, as well as 

 the Ckiac-chia-lacca. The Sandpiper was at this season very fat, and was con- 

 sidered by many little inferior to the Snipe, (S. Wilsonii) for which it often 

 passed. 



[I might remark, in passing, that the Chiac-chia-lacca, as it is called by the 

 Mexicans — a name doubtlessly derived from its peculiar cry, which strikingly re- 

 sembles a repetition of those syllables — is also a capital bird for the table. It ia 

 the Penelope PoUocej}hala of Wajlcr; and since the extension of our domain to 




1851.] 223 



the Rio Grande, is now a bird of the United States. It is very nnmerous on the 

 lower river, where the forests are made to echo with its shrill cry — not unlike 

 that of the Guinea fowl. It is often domesticated by the Mexicans, and goes at 

 large about the grounds.] 



Grus, Linn. 



53. G. Americana Temm. Whooping Crane. ' 



On the whole route I met with but one pair of this large crane. This was at 

 the Arroyo Hondo, in Texas, above San Antonio, in the month of November. I 

 find in my notes taken at Corpus Christi in 1845, that they were seen there occa- 

 sionally in pairs, or in parties of 3 or 4, but never in large flocks, nor in company 

 with G. Canadensis, although the latter were innumerable. Here, this bird was 

 generally observed feeding at the water's edge ; mostly on the river banks or 

 around ponds of fresh water, but also quite frequently on the sandy points that 

 extended into the salt water of the Bay. Whereas, the Brown Crane frequented 

 mostly the lower prairies at some distance from the Bay or River. 



54. G. Canadensis, Temm. Brown Crane. 



This Crane I found on the Rio Grande from Santa Fe to EI Paso, in October; 

 but more particularly between Albuquerque and Sorocco, where, for 50 miles, 

 the land appeared to be covered with them. They filled the cornfields and 

 alighted close to the houses, never being disturbed by the gun. 

 •maiqey n? .eo.T o) hi ^in^ Scolopax, Linn. 



55. S. Wilso'nii, Temm. Common Snipe. 



This bird I found almost every where from the Gulf to Santa Fe, where a 

 patch of wet ground was encountered, but nowhere were they numerous. In 

 1845, numbers nested and raised their broods near Corpus Chr'sti. 

 NuMENius, Briss. 



56. N. BOREALis, Lath. Esquimaux Curlew. 



A few were seen on the plains east of the Rio Grande. 



57. N. LONGiROSTBis, Wilson. Long-billed Curlew. 



These were seen much more frequently than the last, and were common on 

 the plains near the Apache mountains. 



Cygnopsis, Brandt. 



58. C. Canadensis, Brandt. Canada Goose. 



I did not meet the Canada Goose until I reached the Rio Grande, which was 

 at a point 60 milos below El Paso ; thence I found them tolerably numerous 

 until I left the river near Santa Fe. 



Chen, Boie. 



59. C. HYPERBOBEA, Boie. Snow Goose. 



Small ilocks of this Goose were found occasionally in company with the last.

Bernicla, Steph. 



60. B. BRENTA, Steph. Brant or Brent Goose. 



A few only were seen on the Rio Grande. .. 



Anser, Briss. 



61. A. ERYTHROPUS, Linu. White-fronted Goose. 



This Goose was more common than the last ; they were, as I have generally 




224 [Junk, 



found tliera elsewhere, less shy thnn those of any other Epecies. They seek out 

 little pools or mud puddles near tho river, to which iliey resort to feed more 

 habitually than their congeners; and here they are without diflSculty approach- 

 ed and shot. 



Ctqnub, Linn. 



62. C. BUCCINATOR, Rich. Trumpeter Swan. 



In Texas, I at times saw flocks of this swan at great height, and heard their 

 wild, melancholy note, as they leisurely yet swiftly winged their way ihrongh 

 the upper air. 



Anas, Linn. 



The following species T found every where that water was found, in the plains 

 or among mountains, between San Antonio and the llio Grande — a distance, as 

 the crow flies, of over 400 miles. In the midst of extensive plains, I scarcely 

 ever approached a "water-hole" (or rain water pond) in which I did not find 

 small flocks of one or more species. 



63. A. BOSCHAS, Linn. Mallard Duck. 



64. A. STREPERA, Linn. Gadwell Duck. 



65. A. Americana, Gmel. Widgeon or Baldpate. ' 



66. A. Carolinensis, Steph. Green-winged Teal. 

 ^Xr ^- DiscoBS, Linn. Blue-winged Teal. 



68. A. clypbata, Zmw. Shoveller Duck. 



The last, however, I saw only at San Elizario ; where also, and generally 

 along the Rio Grande and Rio Puerco, and their mountain branches, nearly to 

 the foot of the Sierra de los Mimbres, I found most of the others — which shows 

 their extensive range.

 d ges expanded. Upon any disturbance it rapidly retreats within its tube. A 

 sessile species of vorticella is frequently found attached to the posterior part of 

 the body. 



Dr. Leidy, on behalf of the Curators, stated that he desired to cor- 

 rect an error which he had noticed in a report of some remarks by 

 Mr. Squier at a meeting of the American Ethnographical Society, in 

 which Mr. S. stated that Dr. Morton's collection of Crania had been 

 presented to the Academy. Dr. Leidy had ascertained from Dr. 

 Morton's Executors, that the collection had not been presented to this 

 Institution. 



ELECTION OF MEMBERS. 



Caspar Wister, M. D., Charles E. Smith, and John H. Brinton, 

 of Philadelphia, were elected Memlers of the Academy.

A letter was read from Thos. E. Yeateman, Esq , addressed to Geo. 

 W. Carpenter, dated St. Louis, June 16. 1851, in reference to a por- 

 trait of the late Dr. Gerard Troost, which he was ahout transmitting to 

 the Academy, as a donation from himself. 



Also, a letter from Mr. William Haidinger, dated Vienna, 6th June, 

 1851, acknowledging the receipt of his notice of election as a Corres- 

 pondent, and advising of the .<-hipmeut of a present of books to the 

 Academy from himself and M. Hauer, and also the Year-book, sent by 

 the Itoyal Imperial Geological Institution of the Austrian Empire. 



Dr. Leidy stated that the Cicada septendecim was subject to a fun- 

 gous disease. The posterior part of the abdomen he observed in seve- 

 ral instances to be filled with a mass of oval spore-like bodies, embos- 

 sed upon their surface, but becoming smooth from endosmosis when 

 placed in water. 



He also stated he had just received the dead larva of a lamellicorn 

 insect, which was filled with the same fungus which sometimes attacks 

 the mole cricket.

■Communications were read — 



From the Librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, dated July 9th, 

 1851, addressed to the Librarian of the Academy, transmitting a copy 

 of " is'^otices of public Libraries in the United States," published by the 

 Institution. 



From the Librarian of the British Museum, dated 18th July, 1851, 

 acknowledging the receipt of late Nos. of the Proceedings. 



From Dr. Joseph Hyrtl, dated Vienna, July 13th, 1851, acknowledg- 

 ing the receipt of his notice of election as a Corresponding Member. 



Mr. Cassin asked attention of the members to the specimens of owls 

 on the table. 



These specimens comprise parent male and female, and three young birds, 

 fullj grown, which were reared in the woods at Powelton, the residence of 

 John Hare Powel, E-q., at whose hospitable mansion the members of this 

 Academy have been always made welcome. 



The adult male exhibits the plumage of the mottled owl, or Ephialtes nxvia, 

 (Gm.), the adult female that of the red owl, or £. asio {Gm.), and the young 

 birds, sufficiently feathered to be able to fly readily, and which were ascertained, 

 by dissection, to be two males and one female, are assuming the red plumage 

 of their parent female, but having evidently been previously of a grayish white 

 color, the entire plumage of the head and body above and below, with every 

 feather marked with transverse lines of dark reddish gray, very distinct, and 

 not seen in either of the adults. 



The present specimens must, of course, be regarded as fully demonstrating the 

 identity of the red and the mottled owl, and the only point now to be determined 

 is, whether the female ever becomes mottled. This, however, Mr. C. regarded 

 as very probably the case, as it is well established that rapacious birds of 

 several species brted before they assume mature plumage. 



Mr. Phillips made some remarks on a brilliant meteor, which he 

 had observed in this city on the evening of the 3d inst., taking a direc- 




1851.] 237 



tion apparently from West to East. The meteor was remarkable for 

 its bright green color. 



Atigust 12th. 

 Vice-President Wetherill in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper entitled " Contributions to Helminthology, 

 No. 3," which was referred to Drs. Bridges, Watson, and Hallowell. 



Dr. Fisher, in adverting to a suggestion made at a late meeting of 

 the Academy, that it was probable that many of the insects which are 

 destructive to various trees of this country, were periodical in their 

 recurrence, resembling, in this respect, the Cicada septendecim^ 

 remarked that six or seven years since the black caterpillar, or canker 

 worm, had been very destructive to the Elm trees at New Haven, but 

 that since then they were comparatively rare. On a visit to New 

 Haven this summer he found them again very numerous, and doing 

 great injury. 



August Idth. 

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy presented a paper, entitled, *' Conspectus Crustaceorum 

 quae in Orbis Terrarum circumnavigatione Carolo Wilkes e Classe Rei- 

 publicae Foederatae duce lexit et descripsit J. D. Dana ;" which, on 

 motion, was referred to the following Committee : Dr. Leidy, Dr. 

 Bridges, and Dr. J. C. Fisher. 



A letter was read from the " Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Wien," 

 dated xipril 30th, 1851, in reference to the publications of that institu- 

 tion, announced this evening. 



Dr. Fisher read a paper describing a new species of Cicada, named 

 by bim C. Cassinii, which, being intended for publication in the Pro- 

 ceedings, was referred to Dr. Ruschenberger, Mr. C. E. Smith, and 

 Dr. Zantzinger. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper intended for publication in the Proceedings, 

 " Notes on the Cicada Cassinii, and on C. septendecim. Referred to 

 the above Committee. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper entitled " Descriptions of Laniadte," in- 

 tended for publication in the Proceedings. Referred to Col. (x. A. 

 McCall, Mr. Harris, and Dr. Watson. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to several fragments of fossil 

 ruminant ungulates, from Nebraska Territory. 



One of these is the greater portion of a cranium, which, in its perfect condi- 

 tion, had been about 7 inches in length. For the examination of thiyhe ex- 

 pressed his indebtedness to Dr. Hiram A Prout, of St. Louis, who first pointed 

 out the remains of a gigantic species of Palaeotherium, from the same region in 

 which the present fossil was obtained. 



The teeth in the specimen are in a very much mutilated condition, but with 




238 [August, 



the aid of several fragments of upper maxilla; containing perfect teeth, (rom 

 several other individuals of the same animal, received from the Smithsonian In- 

 stitution, through Prof. Baird, the dentition in a great measure can be made out. 



The teeth form nearly a continuous row, as in Anoplotberinm, the only in- 

 terval being one of ' of an inch between the canine and the first premolar. 



The canine is broken away, but judging from the fragment of the root, which 

 is 4 lines in diameter antero-posteriorly, it was well developed. The anterior 3 

 premolars are too much broken to obtain any knowledge of their form. The 

 fourth is like one-half of the true molars, and resembles closely the corres- 

 ponding tooth of Cervus. 



The 3 true molars have exactly the same form, and very nearly the size as 

 the 2 posterior superior molars, described in the Proceedings of this Academy, 

 Vol. iv. p. 47, as characterizing a genus under the name of Merycoidodon. 

 From the latter fact it might be readily supposed that the fossil before us be- 

 longed to Merycoidodon, but a fragment of a face of a smaller animal now ex- 

 hibited, received from Prof. Baird, contains the first and second true molars, 

 mutilated, which have the same form as the corresponding teeth of the pre- 

 ceding fossil, but the fourth premolar has three cusps instead of two, like the 

 former, indicating that we may have animals of different genera, wilh true 

 molars identical in form. 



Neither of these fossils Dr. L. suspected belonged to Merycoidodon, for in it 

 the enamel of the teeth is rougher than in the former. 



For the first he proposed the name of Oreodon. 



The face of Oreodon has a remarkably catlike expression, being depressed, 

 and as broad between the malar bones as it is long. The orbits are closed pos- 

 teriorly as in the ruminants, by the junction of the post-orbital process of the 

 OS frontis with that of the malar bone, and present outward, forward, and up- 

 ward, less in the latter two directions than in the cats, but more so than in the 

 ruminants. 



Just anterior to the orbit is a remarkably large lachrymal depression or lar- 

 mier, relatively several times larger than than that of Cervus virginianus. 



The glenoid cavity is a broad, extensive, nearly flat surface, as in the rumi- 

 nants. 



The posterior portion of the head, relative to the face, is very narrow, and 

 resembles in its form the fragment of a cranium described in Vol. v. of the Pro- 

 ceedings, p. 90, as characteristic of a genus under the name of Eucrotaphus. 



The temporal fossae are as large as in the carnivora, and lead to the im- 

 pression, with other characters given of the head, that flesh probably formed 

 part of the food of the animal. 



The species Dr. L. named Oreodon priscum.

Several fragments were then exhibited of a much smaller animal than the 

 last, consisting of the greater part of the inferior and superior maxillae, the 

 latter containing the 4th premolar and the true molars perfect, having the 

 same form as those of Oreodon priscum. To this species, the name of Oreodon 

 gracile was given. 



The posterior two inferior molars have the same form as the corresponding 

 ones of Merycoidodon.

 The fragment of a face before alluded to having the same form of the supe- 

 rior true molars as Oreodon, but differing from it in having 3 cusps to the 

 fourth premolar, belonged to an animal very closely allied to the latter genus. 

 It possesses the remarkably large lachrymal depression, which in this fossil 

 appears to have been more hemispherical than in Oreodon. The depression 

 being of such a striliing character in Oreodon and in this genus, the name 

 Gotylops was proposed for the latter. The only entire tooth preserved in the 

 fragment of Gotylops is the third premolar, the crown of which is antero-pos- 

 teriorly oblong, constricted in the middle so as to give in outline the form of 

 8. It has a single cusp, and presents an oval fossa about two lines long, 

 postero-internally ; and a heel or short tubercle antero-internally. 

 The species was named Gotylops speciosa.

The fragment of cranium for which was proposed the name Eucrotaphus,*

 close alliance of Oreodon to Merycoidodon, Dr. L. suspected belonged to the 

 latter genus.

long, simple. Intestine narrow, simple. Male attennated at the extremities ; 

 posteriorly rolled into a .spiral, and furnished ventrally with numerous tegu- 

 mentary tubercles. Penis short, corneoris, composed of two lateral portions. 

 Female anteriorly attenuated ; posteriorly terminating in a strong, thick, mus- 

 cular acetabulum, with a posterior conoidal depression containing a single 

 strong, recurved hook. Anus and generative apertures close together, just 

 anterior to the muscular acetabulum. Ovum elliptical, elongated at the poles. 

 The female of this curious genus of netamoid entozoa attaches herself, by 

 means of the posterior hook, to the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal of 

 the animal it infests, while the male clings to the female by winding the posterior 

 part of its body spirally around the posterior part of the latter, retaining itself 

 in that position through the aid of the numerous tubercles upon its ventral 

 surface, which closely apply themselves to the part of contact in the female. 

 1. Synplecta peudula, n. a. 



Body faintly reddish-white, cylindroid. Annulations with from 12 to 18 

 transverse muscular striae. Lobes of the head nearly equal, ffisophagus very 

 long, cylindroid, slightly dilated inferiorly. Intestine narrow, cylindrical.

 body forming three turns of a spiral, furnished ventrally with about 20 longi- 

 tudinal rows of tegumentary tubercles, or small quadrilateral plates l-1600th 

 in. long, by l-26G6th in. broad, extending as far back as the anus. Tail 

 curved, conoidal, 1-GOth in. long from the anus, furnished ventrally with 1 or 

 8 pairs of minute conical tubercles. (Esophagus l-5th line long, l-333d in. 

 broad ; intestine l-400th in. broad. Penis l-200th in. long, conoidal, obtuse, 

 bent at free extremity, composed of two lateral halves. 



Female. 6 to 11 lines long, l-5th to l-4th line broad. Posterior extremity 

 bent, dilated, terminating in a thick, oval, strongly muscular receptacle or 

 acetabulum, truncated posteriorly and excavated into a deep conical cavity, 

 containing a strong hook, with the point directed forward, l-200th in. long,

Habitation. — Siomach and commencement of the small intestine of Emys 

 guttata. 



Remarks. — The female hangs suspended by its posterior hook from the 

 mucous membrane of the stomach of the Emys, in which it is parasitic, while 

 the male clings closely to the female by means of its spiral folds, retaining its 

 position readily from the roughness of surface produced by its numerous ven- 

 tral tubercles, and also those upon the tail. I found this entozoon three times, 

 in 15 individuals of Emys guttata. In one instance it was a large female; in 

 the second two, average size females, and one male ; in the third instance the 

 stomach was distended with the worms, of which about one in five or six was 

 male, and usually clung to the largest of the females.

Ri'markx. — This is the first terrestrial planaria which has been detected in 

 North America. I accidentally discovered it first beneath several flower boxea 

 and pots in the small garden attached to my residence in this city, since which, 

 I sought for and found it in the hilly woods bordering the Wissahickon Creek 

 and Schuylkill River. In its movements it resembles a slug (Limax,) and like 

 this leaves behind it a mucous trail. When in motion, the anterior jiorlion of 

 the body is much elongated, and very narrow, and the portion anterior to the 

 eyes is recurved. Frequently it raises the anterior third of the body from the 

 ground, moving it from side to side as if in search of something. The re- 

 curved portion, inferiorly, is flat, with the edges often inflected. 



When at rest, the body is contracted into an oblong form, and the head lies 

 doubled upon the back. The longest will contract to 21 lines in length by J a 

 line in breadth, and Jd line thick posteriorly, and ^ih line wide anteriorly. 



The coloring matter upon the back is arranged in a faint transverse annuli, 

 accumulating upon each side of the middle into a longitudinal line, and a 

 transverse spot about the centre. 



The eyes are globular, apparently composed of a vitreous humor, two-thirds 

 enveloped with a black pigment. They are situated laterally, the 1-1 00th to 

 the l-48th of an inch posterior to the extremity of the head, and measure 

 about the l-500th in. in diameter. 



The mouth is inferior and a little posterior to the centre. (Esophagus keg- 

 shaped, about l-50th in. long. From the acute tail end is secreted a delicate 

 mucous thread. 



The planaria appears not to like the water, for although it will live for some 

 hours beneath the surface, when prevented from rising, yet it always seeks to 

 leave it, and remains out when it has escaped. 



In the same forest localities with the planaria, is found an insect larva, pos- 

 sessing similar habits, which, upon careless inspection, might be mistaken for 

 it. The movements of the larva are more rapid and vermifular. 



PLANARIA, MuUcr. 



Sub-genus nov. Bdellocra.* 



Characters same as Planaria, without tentaculaj, and the posterior extremity 

 of the body separated by a constriction serving as a disk of attachment. 

 5. Bdellodba parasitica, n. s. 



Body milk white, with a faintly yellowish intestine showing through the 

 translucent integument, smooth, thin, lanceolate, or spatulate ; anteriorly 

 narrowed, obtuse ; lateral margins thin, undulating ; constricted portion pos- 

 teriorly truncated, nearly as broad as the middle of the body. Eyes two, reni- 

 form. (Esophagus simple, cylindrical, campanulate when protruded. 



Length from 3 to 10 lines; breadth 2-5ths to 2|th lines. The longest may 

 contract to 6 lines by 3^ lines. 



Habitation. — Parasitic upon the King Crab, Polyphemus occidentalis, Lam. 



*0Sih\a,& leech; xga, tail; because the animal adheres by the tail like a 

 leech. 




1851.] 243 



Found often in great numbers, adhering with considerable tenacity by means 

 of the posterior constricted extremity of the body, to the under surface of the 

 branchial covers, the branchial lamina, and to the extremities, especially in 

 the vicinity of the joints. 



Remarks. — When the king crab is removed from the water, its planaroid para- 

 site retires to the deepest recesses between the limbs and other external organs 

 to avoid evaporation. The parasite moves with a gliding motion like the species 

 of Planaria, and also by fixing the posterior extremity and extending the anterior 

 part of the body to its gieatest length, and then abruptly detaching and drawing 

 forward the former, like the leeches. At other times it fixes itself posteriorly 

 and waves the anterior portion of the body to and fro through the water. 



Attached to the branchial lamiute of the king-crab, are frequently observed 

 ochreous or brownish, oval, compressed cysts, from |:th to 2 lines long, and l-6th 

 to 1 line broad, attached by a short pedicle at one extremity, and unusually 

 closely applied to the surfaces between the branchial laminae, which are re- 

 ceptacles or ova? of the Bdelloura parasitica. Occasionally the margin of the 

 cysts is provided with a fringe of short, irregular, blackish filaments. Some- 

 times these cysts exist in such numbers as to have the appearance of flaxseed 

 sprinkled between the branchial laminee. 



6. Bdelloura rustica, n. s. 



Body brownish or blackish, translucent, lanceolate ; anteriorly narrowed, ob- 

 tuse; lateral margins thin, undulating; constricted portion truncated posteriorly, 

 with parallel margins. Eyes two, reniform. ffisophagus simple, cylindrical. 



Length 2 to 3 lines ; breadth 2-5ths to 4-5th3 of a line. 



Habitation. — Egg Harbor bay. New Jersey, upon Ulva latissaraa, Linn. 



Remarks. — Movements same as in the preceding species. When free in water 

 it moves with great rapidity, and rises to the surface in the manner of the 

 leech, or the larva of the gnat. 



Gen. nov. MYZOBDELLA.* 

 Body elongated, compressed fusiform, smooth. Head continuous with the 

 body, subindibuliform, obliquely ventrally terminal. MoutU central, unarmed. 

 Acetabulum ventrally obliquely terminal, concave, not corneous. 



7. Myzobdella lugdbris, n. s. 



Body cylindro-fusiform, in transverse section, elliptical, black olivaceous 

 green ; anteriorly narrowed, cylindroid ; posteriorly incrassate. From 15 to 

 18 annulations. Integument translucent, permitting the sacculated intestine 

 of a black green hue to be visible. Acetabulum circular, concave, a little 

 larger than the oral disk. 



When elongated 10 lines, by ^ line in breadth posteriorly, ]-15th of a line 

 anteriorly. Will contract to 4 lines by 4-5ths line in breadth. 



Habitation. — Parasitic upon the common edible crab, Lupa dicantha, M. 

 Edw. ; usually found attached about the base of the limbs. 



MECKEL t A, Leuckart. 



8. Meckelia lactea, n. s. , 



Body very soft, milk white, in transverse section lenticular, convex above and 

 below ; when extended, very much compressed, more especially posteriorly, in- 



* /ut/^ai, I suck ; pStwu, a leech. 




244 [August, 



crassate, rounded just posterior to the head; lateral margins thin, undulating ; 

 posterior extremity thin, sub-acute. Head compressed, conical or hastate, an- 

 teriorly obtuse, breadth at base 1 line; lateral cleft lA lines long. Generative 

 apertures longitudinally oval. 



Greatest length G inches; ordinarily 5 inches, by 3 lines in breadth, and 1 

 line in thickness; may contract to 1 inch in length, by 2 lines in breadth, and 

 U lines in thickness. 



Ildhitation. — In mud and sand under stones, dead shells, etc., in positions un- 

 covered at low fide, upon the coast of Great Egg Harbor, New Jersey. 



Remarks. — The more it is extended the broader and thinner it becomes, espe- 

 cially posteriorly. When free in water it swims like the eels, and in such 

 cases the broad surfaces of the body are more or less vertical. 

 9. Mbckelia rosea, n. s. 



Body bright flesh-colored with fainter lateral margins, and a central darker 

 line inferiorly ; in transverse section oblong, convex superiorly, flattened in- 

 feriorly ; when elongated, becomes cylindrold ; posteriorly, obtuse. Head 

 compressed, conical or hastate, whitish. Generative aperture distinct, round. 



Length from 2 to 6 inches : ordinarily about 5 inches. 



Jlahitadon. — With the preceding species. 



Remarks. — As it elongates it approaches more the cylindrical form, becoming 

 thicker and narrower.

 daj, reported in favor of its publication in the Proceedings. 



Descriptions of new .■species of birds of the family Loniadx, specimens of which are in 

 ike collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



By John Cassin. 

 1. Lanius pallidirostris, nobis. 



Form. — Bill rather long and compressed, wings rather short, with the third 

 quill distinctly longest, general form robust, and that of typical Lanius. About 

 the size of Z. septentrionalis, Gm. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail^ about 8^ 

 inches, wing 4J, tail 4J inches. 



Colors. — Adult. Bill pale horn color. Upper surface of the head, with the 

 back and rump, pale cinereous, scapulars white and conspicuous, wings with 

 a large patch of white on the primaries, and with the secondaries broadly 

 tipped with white. 



A stripe of black through the eye, very narrow on the nares, but wider behind 

 the eye. Entire under-surface white, with a delicate, pale rosy tinge, most ob- 

 servable on the breast. Tail with the two external feathers on each side white, 

 each with a narrow longitudinal line of black on the shaft, slightly widening 

 into both webs, other tail feathers black, tipped with white, except the two in 

 the centre, which are pure black. Tarsi and claws pale brown. 



Mab. — Eastern Africa. 



Obs. — This fine species, of which there is one specimen only in the Rivoli col- 

 lection, may be distinguished readily from all others known to me by its very 




1851 ] 245 



pale horn-colored bill, and the pale rose-red tinge of the under parts of the 

 body. The cinereous plumage above is paler than that of L. ezcubitor, and it is 

 without the white patch on the middle of the secondaries, which is so obvious 

 in that species. It is more nearly related to L. meridionalis, but is smaller and 

 much lighter colored. 

 2. Lanius puUens, nobis. 



Form — Bill rather weak, wing3 and tail rather long, but with the general 

 form of typical Lanius. About the size of L. minor, Gm. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 8 

 inches, wing 4, tail 4^- inches. 



Colors. — (Specimen not in mature plumage.) Rump and entire under surface 

 pure white. Head above and back cinereous, wings black, with a large patch 

 of white on the middle of the primaries, and with the secondaries edged and 

 broadly tipped with white, tail with the two external feathers on each side 

 white, with the shafts black, others black with white tips, very narrow on the 

 four central feathers. 



A black stripe through the eye, above which is a stripe of white. 



Bill and tarsi dark horn-color. 



Hub. — Fazogloa, Eastern Africa. 



Obs. — This species considerably resembles the preceding, butdififers in having 

 the rump white, and appears to be, so far as preserved specimens can be relied 

 on, a smaller and more slender bird ; the bill is not so long nor powerful. Two 

 specimens are in the Rivoli collection, neither of which are fully adult. 



3. Laniarius quadricolor, nobis. 



Form. — Much resembling that of L. gutturalis {Daud.) but is smaller, and 

 the tail more rounded. Wings short, rounded, fourth, fifth and sixth prima- 

 ries longest and nearly equal. 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail, about 7^ 

 inches, wing 3^, tail 3^- inches. 



Colors. — (^ Adult. Generally resembling those of L. gutturalis (Daud.), but 

 with the abdomen and ventral region yellow, and the basal portion of the tail 

 olive green. Entire superior surface of the head, body, and wings olive green, 

 which is also the color of a basal third of the external, and of three-fourths of 

 the central tail feathers. Throat fine scarlet, stripe through the eye and wide 

 pectoral band, black; beneath the latter a badly defined band of yellowish 

 scarlet, fading irto the rich greenish yellow of the abdomen, under tail coverts 

 yellowish scarlet. Bill black, paler at the base, tarsi and feet pale brown. 



(^ young. — Resembling the adult, but with the tail entirely green, and the 

 throat, under parts of the body and inferior tail coverts pale greenish yellow; 

 a trace of black lines on the feathers of the breast, and of scarlet on those of 

 the throat. 



Hab. — Port Natal, Eastern Africa. 



Obs. — Of this beautiful bird two adult males and several young birds are in 

 the collection of this Academy. They are from the collection of M. Verrtfaux of 

 Paris, and were accompanied by this significant memorandum, — " consider(;e 

 comme diflferente de la, gutturalis." I have invariably found that M. Verreaux's 

 opinion of species is of the greatest value, in fact almost infallible. 




2^f> [August, 



This bird may readil}' be distinguished from the huqer L.ffufluralin, of which 

 we have specimens also, by the ciiuracters above ifidicated, and especially by 

 its yellow abdomen. 



4, Dryoscopus sublacteus, nobis. 



Fortn. — Rill and legs rather long, wings rounded, with the fourth to the 

 eighth quills nearly equal and longest, plumage of the rump downy and pro- 

 fusely developed. Somewhat larger than D. Gambcims (Lic-ht. ) 



Dimensions. — Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail, about 7} 

 inches, wing 8.], tail 3J inches. 



Colors. — Adult. Entire plumage of the head and body above, wings and 

 tail glossy black ; downy plumage of the rump grayish white at base and 

 tipped with black, (as in D. rufiventris (Swainson) Le Vaill. Ois. d'Af., pi. C8, 

 and D. ethiopicus (Gm.) Rupp. Uebersicht, pi. 23). 



Under plumage entirely very pale ochraceous white or cream color, deepest 

 on the flanks (same color as in D. ethiopicus). No white markings on the 

 wings nor other part of the plumage. 



Bill blfick. tarsi paler. 



Hab. — Eastern Africa ? 



Ohs. — A general resemblance exists between the bird now described and 

 several other species of Dryoscopus, but it is peculiar in having the fine cream- 

 colored under surface of the body, and no white marks whatever on the wings. 



5. Dryoscopns atrialalus, nobis. 



Form. — Bill long, wings with the fourth quill longest, tail rather long and 

 ample. Generally similar to D. affinis (G. li. Gray), but is larger, being about 

 the size of i>. Gamlensis (Licht.) 



Comparative Dimensions. 



D. trialatus. D. affinis. 

 Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail, about 7^ G\ inches. 



wing, 4 3J 



tail, • 3J 2% 



Colors. — Adult. Very similar to those of D. affinis (G. R. Gray), and gene- 

 rally to those of Chaunonotus Sabinei (J. E. Gray). 



Entire upper surface, except the rump, deep black ; under parts and rump 

 white. Wings clear black, with no white edgings or tips to either quills or 

 coverts, tail black, shafts of the feathers white at base beneath, bill black, 

 tarsi brown. 



Inferior wing coverts black (white in D. affinis.) 

 Bab. — Eastern Africa ? 



Obs. — One specimen only of this bird in the Rivoli collection. It was la- 

 belled " L. Sabinii," having evidently been mistaken for Chaunonotus Sabinei, 

 above alluded to, which has recently been added to the collection of the 

 Academy, but from which the bird now described is generically distinct. It 

 is very similar to D. afBnis, but may readily be distinguished by its larger size 

 and black inferior wing coverts.

A letter was read from the Trustees of the New York State Library, 

 dated Albany, Aujrust 11th, Ih.jl, ackuowledgirig the receipt of late 

 numbers of the Proceedings. 



Also a letter from Mrs. Charlotte H. Towusend, dated Philadelphia,

Mr. Lea remarked that he had observed in a recent number of the Proceed- 

 ings of the Boston Society of Natural History, a corarauniciition on the subject 

 of the " Wave Theory," in regard to the dynamics of earthquakes. He observed 

 that this " wave theory " was by no means of as recent a date as was generally 

 imagined, and stated that Dr. Frabklin, while in France in 1782, distinctly 

 suggested this wave motion, produced by a central force reaching to an im- 

 mense distance. Mr. L. read part of Dr. Franklin's letter to the Abb6 Soulavie, 

 Trans. Am. Phil. Soc, vol. 3 p. 1, old series,) dated at Passey, September 22, 

 17S2, in which he says, " But we are still subject to the accidents on the sur- 

 face, which are occasioned by a wave in the internal ponderous fluid ; and such 

 a wave is producible by the sudden violent explosion you mention, happening 

 from the junction of fire and water under the earth, which not only lifts the 

 incumbent earth which is over the explosion, but impressing with the same 

 force the fluid under if, creates a wave that may run a thousand leagues, lift- 

 ing thereby successively all the countries under which it passes."

A communication was read from Aug. A. Gould, M. D., and D.

 of Boston, dated Boston, July, 1851, presenting, in accordance with 

 his will, a copy of Vols. 1 and 'J. of his work on the Terrestrial Mol- 

 lusks of the United States. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of members to a fragment of rock a 

 few inches square, covered upon one surface with numerous root-like 

 fibres, which he stated belonged to a species of branching, fresh water, 

 ciliated polyps of the genus Plumatella The piice had been broken 

 from a slab I'i inches square, which was entirely covered upon its 

 under surface iu the same manner. The species he characterized as 

 follows : 



PLUMATELLA, Base. 

 Plumatella diffusa, n. s. 



Polypidom diverging from a centre over large surfaces, consisting of a series 

 of simple curved branches, from one to two lines long, rising from one affother 

 upon the convex side, and attached throughout their length except at the ex- 

 tremities for l-3ih to 2-5ths of a line, which are erect, keg-shaped, or a little 

 dilated at the middle and contracted at the orifices. Border of the orifices'

deepry emarginafc and continuous, with a fjisure down the inner or concave 

 side of the branches, upon the summit of a slight ridge. Color dirty olivaceous 

 brown, with the erect extremities of the branches yellowish or translucent 

 whitish. 



I'olyp with 4'2 divergent, sigmoid tentaciilae, arranged at their summits in 

 the ouiline of a reniform disk. Length of the tentacula; about 3-5ths line. 

 Color of the stomach greenish yellow. 



Ovum wiih its marginal sheath semi-oval, l-OSth in. long', l-3.33d in. broad. 

 Sheath whitish, translucent, smooth, cellular; with the aperture upon its con- 

 vex side 1-I42d in. in diameter; that upon the flat side l-133d in. Ovum len- 

 ticular, reddish brown. 



Habitation — Upon the under surface of stonfs which do not come in contact 

 entirely with the ground, in running brooks and creeks emj)tying into the 

 Schuylkill and Delaware rivers, and also in the latter. 



Remarks. — This species of Plumatella appears to prefer for its residence 

 stones of large size. It is not common to find it on such as are under 3 or 4 

 inches square, but is frequently seen covering surfaces closely from one to 

 several feet square, upon which I have counted from 150 to 300 polyps to the 

 square inch. It also flourishes best in the course of currents of moderate 

 strength. 



The object of its occupying the under surface of stones appears to be not so 

 much to escape from the light, as it is to favor the removal of the abundant 

 excrement, which is voided in the form of oblong, greenish or clay colored 

 pellets. 



The interior structure of Plumatella corresponds pretty closely with those of 

 Alcyonella. 



The extruded ova are frequently found attached to rocks, generally by the 

 flat side, but sometimes by the convex side. 



The sheath of the ovum is composed of transparent colorless cells, about the 

 1- 4000th in. in diameter. 



Whilst observing this species of Plumatella under a lens, I noticed several 

 small aquatic larvag, probably of a species of Hydrophilus, according to my 

 friend Dr. Le Conte, which would advance the anterior part of the body, up 

 the erect portion of the branches of the polypidom, with all the stealth of a 

 spider, until upon a level with the margin of the orifices, when they would 

 suddenly dart with great rapidity upon the body of the polyps; but in every 

 instance, for a quarter of an hour in which I observed them, the latter suc- 

 ceeded in escaping by contracting within the tubes, where the larvae appeared 

 not to be disposed to follow them. 



Dr. Leidy observed that he had for some time past been collecting 

 m iterials towards elucidating the natural history of the family of Gor- 

 diaces^, Hithold, upon which he was now preparing a memoir for the 

 Journal. 



Our most common species has been confounded with the Gordius aquaticus, 

 X., of Europe, but a striking character at once proves it to be distinct. The 

 caudal extremity of the female is trifurcated, while that of the European species 

 is blunt.* The length is from 4 to 12 inches. Of this species there are seve- 

 ral varieties from different localities, which may, upon further comparison, 

 prove to be distinct species. 



* Siebold: Arch. f. Naturg. 1838, p. 303. 




1851.] 268 



To this species the name Gordius varius was proposed. A second species of 

 Gordius was obtained by Professor Baird from a spring in Essex County, New 

 York. It is very much more delicate than the former, and from 5 to 7 inches 

 long. The female caudal extremity is blunt. The male caudal extremity la 

 bifurcate and fringed with peculiar epidermoid appendages. 



Por this second species the name Gordius lineatus was proposed. 



Dr. L. also had found several remarkable species of Mermis, Dujardin. 



Eleven specimens of one species were procured by Dr. Budd from a ditch in 

 New Jersey. These are yellowish white in color, and from 6 to 18 inches in 

 length. To the species the name Mermis elongata was given. 



A second species was found in a ditch near Philadelphia. It is pure white 

 in color, 8 inches long, and has a peculiar tubercular thickening of the integu- 

 ment upon the caudal extremity. For this species the name Mermis crassican- 

 data was proposed. 



Dr. L, further remarked that he had lately had an opportunity of repeating 

 his former investigations* upon the embryology of Gordius varius. 



The embryology of Gordius aquaticus, L., had been studied and published 

 by Grubyl before he had published his notes, but he did not know it at the 

 time, wtiich he considered important, as the observations conducted in two 

 parts of the world, though differing in several specific points, were generally 

 confirmatory of one another. 



The perfect embryo of Gordius varius differs so much from the parent that 

 it is impossible to recognise the latter in the former. This has two circles of 

 protiactile tentaculae, each of six, and a protractile proboscis, not uncinate, 

 however, as in the embryo of Gordius aquaticus;]:, no trace of which exist in 

 the parent. The body of the embryo consists of two portions, and is dis- 

 tinctly annulated, while the parent is simply hair-like in form, and has no 

 trace of an annulated integument. Gruby remarks he never saw the Gordius, 

 excepting the embryo, shorter than 3| inches,^ so that between the annulose, 

 tentaculated embryo, in the Gordius varius the l-466th of an inch in length, 

 and the parent of at least 3f inches, nothing whatever is known of the history 

 of the animal. Gordii have been stated upon numerous and the most reliable 

 authorities to have been seen in the body of insects, so that from the embryo 

 to the parent, there may probably be a series of forms in alternating genera- 

 tion, entozoic and ectozoic, as numerous and unlike as has been observed in 

 the development of certain species of Distoma. 



The Gordius varius is prolific in a very remarkable degree. A female 9 

 inches in length placed in a tumbler of water, September 25th, up to the pre- 

 sent time has extruded a string of ova 49 inches in length and still actively 

 continues the, process.

A letter was read from the Imperial Society of Naturali>ts of Mos- 

 cow, dated Gth and l8th May, 1851, presentinf^ the numbers of the 

 Bulletin of that Institution announced this eveninir. 



Dr. Le Conte exhibited a series of tertiary fossils from San Diego, Califor- 

 nia ; they bore the closest resemblance to species now living on that const ; 

 the formation is of great extent along the coast, although very narrow. In 

 passing from ^an Diego to the Colorado river, he observed that these tertiary 

 beds were soon succeeded by various kinds of porphyry, and these by sienitic 

 metaraorphic rocks ; the upper beds of these exhibited a very curions arrange- 

 ment, being light colored, with fusiform masses of dark sienite, all placed with 

 their longitudinal axes parallel. The sections of these masses were 5 — 18 inches 

 long, and 1^ to 3 inches thick; these metamorphic rocks became more gra- 

 nitic, and in some places gneissoid in their character towards the central part 

 of the Sierra. Near Valleido these micaceous strata were much contorted. 

 The eastern range of the Sierra at this point consists entirely of a very coarse 

 conglomerate, containing rounded masses from the above mentioned metamor- 

 phic rocks of immense size; the cement is granitic gravel, with a very small 

 amount of calcareous matter. Dr. Le Conte was inclined to consider this 

 chain, which is near 5000 feet high, as belonging to the cretaceous epoch ; it is 

 flanked by a small deposit of unstratified drift, which becomes stratified a few 

 miles distant from the base of the mountains. Underlying the drift is a ter- 

 tiary fjormation containing small beds of sandstone and gypsum, precisely as 

 at San Diego : only Ostrea were found in these beds. In a small hill north of 

 Cariso Creek, he had found limestone beds composed almost entirely of Gna- 

 thodon, and farther in the desert the same shell was found in strata of clay, 

 lying almost vertically. The desert has two levels, the lower being covered 

 with alluvium, containing numerous Planorbis and Anodon, with smaller fresh 

 water species now inhabiting the Colorado; the upper level is about 50 to 70 

 feet above this alluvium, and consists of stratified matter usually very sandy, 

 and belongs to the drift epoch. The range of sand hills is formed from the 

 lighter portions of this upper level near the edge. In the northern part of the 

 desert is a salt lake, on the edge of which is a solfatara with boiling water and 

 mud; some of the water issues in jets from small cones of insvissated mud, 

 which form over the circular pools. The water deposited large quantities of 

 sal ammoniac tinged with sulphur, and within a short distance from these 

 pools are eight small volcanic mounds of lava and pumice; for many miles 

 stranded pieces of pumice are found on the alluvial level. 



Dr. Le Conte also expressed his opinion that the Vancouver I.-land coal be- 

 longed, like that found in Oregon, to the tertiary epoch ; it was very fragile 

 and light, exhaled a peculiar odor which is characteristic of tertiary lignites. 



It existed in a single stratum (as he learned from persons who had visited 




1851 j 265 



the bed,) of 22 inches in thlcltness, horizontal, and but a short distance from 

 the surface. The shafts sunk had not yet reached any other deposit. 



No distinct vegetable impressions had been found, although Dr. L. had care- 

 fully examined a large quantity of the coal. He considered the existence of 

 true carboniferous deposits in California highly improbable. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the mptubers to a pjriform mass, 

 about three inches long by one and a half broad at the base, suspended 

 in a vessel of water. This he said consisted of numerous Polypi 

 within their polypidom encrusting a dead branch of a tree, and was 

 taken from a similar mass one yard long, with an additional lateral 

 branch two feet long, found in a ditch below the city. The species 

 he characterized as follows : 



CRISTATELLA, C-iv. 

 Ckistatella magnifica, n. s. 



Polypidom massive, fixed, encrusting bodies from a few inches to several 

 feet in length, by a few linos to 2 inches in diameter, gelatinoid, consistent, 

 hyaline, with numerous polypi upon the free surface arranged in close, irregu- 

 lar areolae. 



Polypi furnished with 2 lobes conjoined together in the form of U, enclosing 

 the mouth at the base, and having diverging from the margins from 50 to 80 

 sigmoid tentacul^ arranged at the summit in the double outline of U, with the 

 extremities of the arms of the latter inclining towards each other. Lip ele- 

 vated, with the base of the tentacular lobe, and the lower fourth of the inner 

 margin of the tentaj;ulae in the vicinity of the mouth, lake or dark rose-red 

 color; oesophagus colorless; stomach longitudinally folded, yellowish brown; 

 rectum dilatable, hyaline, its extremity slightly projecting but retractile. 



Length from the bottom of the stomach to the top of the extended tenta- 

 culai I2 lines. Long diameter of tentacular expanse h to 3-5th line. Length 

 of tentacula; l-40th in.; breadth 1-1 000th in. 



Ovum lenticular, brown, enclosed at the margin by a brownish white, annu- 

 lar, cellular sheath, l-200th in. deep upon one side, l-166th in. upon the other 

 side, furnished at its outer edge with 14 to 16 appendages l-200th in. long, 

 terminating in a double, rarely a triple booklet. Ovum with its sheath, thin, 

 discoidal, bent, l-33d in. broad, with its appendages enveloped in a hyaline, 

 albuminoid mass ; when ripe floating. 



Ilabilalion. — Upon dead branches or twigs of trees, in ditches or sluggish 

 streams in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, in shaded situations. 



Remarks. — The extent of this polyp appears to be determined by that of its 

 basement of attachment. It is usually found surrounding twigs or dead 

 branches of trees which have fallen into the water, and is permanently fixed to 

 its position. 



The surface of the polyp mass has the appearance of being covered with a 

 dense mucor from the numerous tentacula projecting from it. Immediately 

 beneath this is a layer having a faint roseate hue from the red coloring in the 

 vicinity of the mouth of the polypi, then succeeds a layer of a dirty yellowish 

 color, arising from the stomach of the animals, beneath which are numerous 

 opaque, white, yellowish, and brown spots, which are ova in various stages of 

 development, and finally the greater depth of the mass consists of a perfectly 

 hyaline, consistent, gelatinoid substance. 




266 [September, 



After the death of the animals, and their bodies and tubes have macerated 

 from the surface of the polypidoni, their bases upon the areol.'e of attachment 

 have an irregular stellate or lobate ajjpearance, which penetrate in a conver- 

 gent manner to the nuclear twig or branch. The decaying mass has a strong 

 odor in a remarkable degree like that of putrid fish. 



The animal is not so irritable iis Pluraatelln, but is like it capable of entirely 

 retracting within its tube, in which state the stomach appears transversely 

 wrinkled. 



The ova as they are detached from the mass rise near, or to the surface of 

 the water and float. 



There is probably some confusion existing in the distinction of the genera 

 Cristatella and Alcyonella, as characterized by Cuvier, Lamarck, Allman, &c., 

 but, if correct, then C. magnifica would belong to a new genus between Crista- 

 tella, C'liv., and Alcyonella, Lam., for while the polyp and its ovum corres[)ond 

 to the former, the polypidom corresponds to the latter. Should it prove dis- 

 tinct I propose for it the name FectinatcUa. 



Dr. Leidy further stated as follows : 



The female Gordius, which he had mentioned at the last evening as having 

 extruded from September 25th up to that time a cord of ova 49 inches in length, 

 had continued the process until Sunday evening, October Vtb, up to which 

 time it had expelled in fragments from a few lines to one foot in length, in all 

 a cord 91 inches long, in which he estimated there were over 6,000,000 ova. 

 Dr. L. exhibited the cord of ova preserved in alcohol, which was long and 

 white and resembled a piece of cotton thread. »

PAGURIDEA. 



The Paguridea include two groups, distinguished by peculiarities in the 

 form of the inner antenns, outer maxillipeds, and some other characteristics ; 

 — the one a qua fie in habit, and the other subierr "'Atrial. They are as follows : 



Fam. I. Fagcrid^k. — Inner antenna? short, first joint very short. Palpus of 

 maxillipeds with a multi-articulate flagellum. Aquatic or littoral. 



Fam. II. CenobitiDv*;. — Inner antennae very long, the first joint of the base 

 as long as the eyes or longer, and bent obliquely downward. Palpus of outer 

 maxillipeds without a flagellum. Subterrestiial. 



The Pagurida3 have hitherto, been divided into but two genera ; Pagurus, 

 with unsymmetrical abdomen, and CanceZZws, (Edw.) with symmetrical. There 

 are, however, important characteristics, which point to a division into other 

 groups. These have been partly indicated by Milne Edwards, in the subdivi- 

 sions of the genus Pagurus, laid down in his work on Crustacea,* and more 

 distinctly in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles, for July, 1848. f In the lat- 

 ter article there are discrepancies in certain instances, between the character 

 of the species and those mentioned for the subdivisions, which we find it diffi- 

 cult to reconcile; such as the placing of P. tibicen, and some related species, 

 with his "^quimanes," when, in fact, the left hand is very much larger than 

 the right, and the guttatus and granulatus with the " Senestres,'' although, in 

 the former, the hands are nearly equal, as in many of the "^Equimanes," and 

 in the latter the right hand (as is observed io his " Crustacea ") is actually the 

 larger. Yet his sections are, in the main, natural groups, and some of them 

 have more important points of distinction than he has mentioned. 



The Pagurus Bernhardus is the type of one of these groups. Besides being 

 " dextres," they are peculiar in having acuminate fingers^ with the tips of those 

 of the larger hand calcareous ; and although the feet of the 4th pair. are sub- 

 cheliform, like most other Paguridaj, the scabrous area or rasp of the hand is 

 confined nearly to the posterior edge. Moreover, the species belong mainly to 

 colder waters, while the ordinary Paguri abound especially in the tropics. All 

 the Pdguri of England (or with but one uncertain exception, recently pointed 

 out,) are of the Benhardus type; those of, the Northwest coast of America are 

 the same. We naturally, therefore, distinguish this group as a genus under 

 the name of Bernhardus. 



Among the remaining Paguri, the larger part have the feet of the 4th pair 

 subcheliform, the penult joint being broad, and the last (or tarsus) forming a 

 finger placed on its anterior margin. Yet, a few have these feet vergiform, 

 the tarsus being terminal ; and these species are also peculiar, in having two 

 pairs of slender appendages at the base of the abdomen, on account of which 

 they are called the " Pagures appendicules " by Edwards. Besides, they have 

 the flagellum of the outer anteunije more or less hairy, and often lonrg ciliate 

 along the under side, and, also, the inner antennai have a longer base than 

 usual, the 2d basal joint reaching nearly, or quite, to the extremity of the 



* Crustac^s, ii., 223, and Annales des Sci. [2], vl., 257. 

 t Ann. des Sci. Nat. [3], x., 50.

eyes. These ppecies make a well characterized group, which we name Pagu- 

 rixtfs. 



Another sniiill group is singular in having a ro'triform appendage to the 

 npthiilmic joint; they are the " Pagurcs armC-s" of Edwards, including/'. 

 miles and P. cus/os, the former the Cancer Diogenes of Herbst. Besides this 

 distinction, the fingers of the hands are acumitiated, as in the Bernhnrdi, and 

 have calcareous tips, although the species are not right-handed ; also, the 2d 

 joint of the outer antenn;e is complete on the upper side, and there is no move- 

 able appendage or acicle (a name we give to the so-called pulpui?, in allusion 

 to its form). With these distinctions, the group is entitled to the rank of a 

 genus, whicli may be named Diogenen. 



The remaining species of Paguri are similar, in having the fingers of the 

 hands more or less spoon-shaped ; — with no rostriform appendage to the op- 

 thalmic segment between the eyes; — the outer antennse bearing a moveable 

 acicle ; — the flagellum of the outer antennae naked ; the 2d joint of the base of 

 the inner antentite not reaching to extremity of eyes; the feet of the 4th pair 

 subcheliform with the scabrous area on the hand, lateral and broad. 



The great majority of these have the tips of all the fingers corneous. But a 

 few have these tips in the larger hand calcareous, besides being peculiarly 

 smooth and neat in the appearance of the limbs, and naked, or nearly so, with 

 the shell more calcareous than usual. They have the left hand much the 

 larger: jet unlike those species with corneous tips to the fingers that are 

 strongly left-handed, the front margin has a small salient point at middle. Of 

 the species with calcareous tips to the fingers, I make the genus Calcinus. 

 Tuis genus includes the old species P. (ibicen, Gaimardii, elegans, &c. 



The remaining species, still the larger part of the whole family, constitute 

 the genus Pagurus. The following is a synopsis of the subdivisions proposed-

The Committee to which was referred Dr. J. C. Fi.-her' dc«criptioa 

 of a new species of Cicada, with Mr. Casein's Notes on the same and 

 on C. scptendecim, reported in favor of publication in the Proceedings. 



On a new species of Cicada. 

 By J. C. Fisher, M. D. 



In the course of the observations made by the Committee of this Academy, 

 to which was assigned the duty of investigating the habits and history of the 

 seventeen year Locust, Cicada septendecim, which appeared during the present 

 year (1851) in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, the attention of its memt.er8 

 was directed by Mr. John Cassin to the fact that two species had been con- 

 founded, and that the insect regarded as the smaller variety was in fact a dis- 

 tinct species, a conclusion at which he had arrived during their previous ap- 

 pearance in 1834. It is much smaller, is blacker in color, especially on the 

 lower surface of the abdomen, where also the segments are bordered more 

 narrowly with yellow, and has a note entirely different from that of the larger 

 Cicada septendecim, Linn. Syst. Nat. i., pt. ii., p. 708, (1767). 



The two species did not associate together, but were found mostly on separ- 

 ate trees, the smaller being the less abundant. 



I propose on these grounds to characterize the smaller species as follows : — 



Cicada Cassinii, nobis. (J' total length of body, 9-10th3 of an inch ; of the 

 wings, 1 2-lOths inches ; 9 frequently smaller. 



Colors and general appearance much like those of Cicada septendecim, Linn., 




1851.] 273 



but darker, and the segments of the abdomen below are more narrowly bor- 

 dered with yellow. Note different to that of C. sejjtendecim, and more like 

 that of some of the grasshoppers. Inhabits the neighborhood of Philadel- 

 phia, appearing in the winged or perfect state at intervals of seventeen years. 



Note on the above species oj Cicada, and on the Cicada septendecim, Linn- 

 By John Cassin. 



There are two distinct and easily recognized species of Cicada which appear 

 at intervals of seventeen years, and both of which were observed in this neigh- 

 borhood, especially in the woods at Powelton, during the present year. I saw 

 them in Delaware county, Pennsylvania, in 1834, and their entire specific dis- 

 tinctness I have insisted on through good and evil report for the last seven- 

 teen years. 



It was therefore highly gratifying to me to have an opportunity of calling 

 the attention of the gentlemen of this Academy to the smaller species which 

 Professor Fisher h^s done me the honor of naming as above, and particularly 

 to its note. This is quite diff-rent from the prolonged and loud scream of the 

 larger species, (which is C. septendecim, Linn.) and begins with an introductory 

 clip, clip, quite peculiar. No disposition to associate with each other exists 

 between the two species, and although I have seen both on the same tree, yet 

 most frequently they were entirely separated, and occupied different parts of 

 the woods. In 1834, I observed the smaller species in localities which were 

 somewhat favorably situated for moisture, but during the present year it 

 occurred in localities as varied as those of the other and larger species. At 

 Powelton it was very abundant in an orchard of" apple trees on the most ele- 

 vated part of the estate, and also on trees ia the aJj tcent woods. 



That the smaller species preferred low grounds was the observation of Dr. 

 Hildreth, of Marietta, Ohio, who, in an article on the Cicada septendecim, in Sil- 

 liman's Journal, xviii. p. 47, (1830) has the following paragraph : — " There ap- 

 peared to be two varieties of the Cicada, one smaller than the other; there 

 was also a striking difference in their notes. Tbe smaller variety was more 

 common in the bottom lands and the larger in the hills." 



The size and the peculiar note are the most striking characters of the smaller 

 species, otherwise it much resembles the larger. The consideration of its 

 claims to specific distinction involves the general problem of specific character, 

 which is difficult in theory, but practically is readily solved. An animal 

 which constantly perpetuates its kind, or in other words reproduces itself 

 either exactly or within a demonstrable range of variation, is a species. These 

 two Cicadx do not associate together as varieties commonly do. Of the very 

 numerous instances in which the phenomenon introductory to propagation has 

 been observed this year, in the course of the particular attention paid to these 

 insects by gentlemen of this Academy, not one case occurred in which the male 

 and female of the two insects were seen together. They are distinct species. 



The appearar ce of the Cicada septendecim in various localities at different 

 periods, each terminating intervals of seventeen years, for instance in Ohio in 

 1846 and in Eastern Pennsylvania in 1851, is a matter of remarkable interest. 

 Many independent ranges or provinces are known to exist in the United States, 

 and they are now ascertained to be so numerous that this species probably ap- 




274 September, 



pears in some part of the country every year. Assuming all tliat part of North 

 America in which it has ever been observed to be its zoological province, how 

 are the sub-provinces and different times of appearance to be accounted for? 

 Are all those sub-provinces to be regarded as the theatres of independent cre- 

 ations? Do the facta demonstrate that the same species may exist in provinces 

 which may be presumed to have had different eras of origin? 



It would be a curious fact, and one of important application, that exactly the 

 same species can inhabit provinces having independent creations, and if, too, 

 as in the case of this insect, it should be clearly impossible for it to have ex- 

 tended from one province to another. 



Or, can it be possible that every distinct district in which the Cicada appear 

 is really an entomological province, and that entomological provinces in this 

 part of North America are quite restricted in extent, as has been observed by 

 Dr. Le Conte in California? (Communicated by that gentleman to the Ame- 

 rican Association for the advancement of Science at its meeting in August , 

 1851.) 



Those sub-provinces may have relations to geologic changes. Having the 

 extraordinary characteristic necessity of remaining in the earth for seventeen 

 years, as a fact in the history of this insect, may it be possible to infer that geo- 

 logic changes have effected the difference in the times of its appearance, or 

 that so short periods as fractions of seventeen years have been of geologic im- 

 portance throughout the range of the Cicadx? 



The Cicada septendecim has appeared in the vicinity of Philadelphia, at inter- 

 vals of seventeen years, certainly since 1715. There has been, it appears, no 

 variation of temperature, nor causes accidental nor other since that date suflS- 

 cient to affect its habits in any perceptible degree. It is stated in Clay's Swed- 

 ish Annals, to have appeared in May, 1715, in this neighborhood, (which, so 

 far as I know, is the earliest authentic record ;) punctually in the same month, 

 every seventeeth year, now certainly for nearly one hundred and fifty years, has 

 this extraordinary insect been known to make its visit. No causes have af- 

 fected it duuing that period, not even so far as relates to the month in which it 

 appears. 



Passing, I would observe that so far as relates to the neighborhood of Phila- 

 delphia, the Cicada septendecim clearly had not a fair start with the year 1, — 

 anno mundi of the commonly received chronology. If it had had, the sum 

 produced by 1851X4004 — 1 ought to divide by 17 without a remainder, which 

 it will not do, — more insignificant facts than which have troubled schoolmen. 



I have never seen any animals more entirely stupid than the seventeen year 

 Locusts. They make no effort to escape, but allow themselves to be captured 

 with perfect passiveness, thus reminding one of the lameness of animals in coun- 

 tries where they are not molested by enemies. All animals of as high grade of 

 organization as these insects, acquire instincts from impressions made by the 

 presence of danger and otherwise, which they transmit to their offspring. The 

 young Fox of to-day is undoubtedly superior to his juvenile progenitor of a 

 century since. The cicadte have acquired no such instinct. Their short life of 

 maturity above the surface of the earth does not appear to be of sufficient du- 

 ration for such to be formed and impressed on their posterity. 



In short, it appears to me that the study of these insects, and the examina- 

 tion of their separate ranges, might result in conclusions of extraordinary im- 

 portance, especially relative to modern views of the distribution of animals- 




1851.] 275 



No animal is more easily traced. In other aspects, too, they present interesting 

 points for study, perhaps of general interest in zoological science. 



Dr. Zantzinger offered the following, which was adopted. 



Resolved^ That a member of the Society be appointed to prepare a 

 new and extended " Notice of the Academy," to be read before the 

 Society, and designed for publication. 



The Chairman, on motion being authorized to make the appoint- 

 ment, selected Dr. Ruschenberger, who accepted the same.

The Kev. Lorenzo L. Langstroth, of Philadelphia, was elected a 

 Member of the Academy. 



October 7th, 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper intended for publication in the Proceedings, 

 entitled " Corrections and Additions to former papers on Helmintho- 

 logy, published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sci- 

 ences of Philadelphia," which was referred to Dr. Zantzinger, Dr. 

 Fisher, and Dr. Watson. 



A letter was read from the Secretary of the Geological Society of 

 London, dated May 1st, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of recent 

 numbers of the Proceedings. 



Dr. Leidy remarked, the members probably recollected that a few evenings 

 since he had mentioned, that it had been asserted by numerous and good au- 

 thorities, that Gordii had been observed within the body of insects. He now 

 exhibited a specimen of a Gordius and a grasshopper, preserved in a bottle of 

 alcohol, which had been sent to him by his friend Dr. Budd, of Pemberton^ 

 New Jersey. The Gordius, Dr. Budd stated, was seen to come out of the body 

 of the grasshopper, and in a half an hour afterwards died. It is a different 

 species from those described a short time since. It is a female, about six 

 inches long, by half a line in length, rigid, strongly marked by transverse 

 wrinkles, and annuli, with the caudal extremity somewhat compressed and ob- 

 tupe. To the species he gave the name Gordius robustus. 



He also exhibited a species of Mermis from Brazil, belonging to the collec- 

 tion of the Academy. It is fourteen and a half inches long, and of a reddish 

 brown color. To it he gave the name Mermis ferrugiaea.

 Committee consistin<i of Dr. Leidy, Dr. Halluwell, and Dr. Hornor. 



Dr. Fisher read a note from Dr. C. D. Meiys, announcing; that he 

 was now prepared to read before the Society his biographical Memoir 

 of the late Dr. Morton. 



Profi'ssDr Horner narrated a case illu'Jtrarinfj the extreme lethargy 

 produced by the action of Carbonic acid iras on the human system. 

 'J'he individual, while engaged in burning lime, had fallen asleop dur- 

 ing the niuht upon the tdge of the kiln, and had been exposed to the 

 ai'tion of this gas for many successive hours. A great part of the right 

 fore arm, arm, scapula, and back had been severely burned, without the 

 knowledge of the patient, until he was extricated by persons passing 

 next morning. 



Dr. Leidy presented for the inspection of the members a mutiUted cranium 

 of an extinct mammal, formerly characterized by bim under the name of Oreo- 

 don priscum.* li was one of five specimens of crania of the same species 

 lately received through Professor Bnird from the Smithsonian Institute. When 

 first obtained, one side was completely enveloped within a matrix, upon the 

 removiil of which the comjilete dentition of the animal was disclosed. The 

 teeth form a continuous arch as in Anoplo herium. The formula is m. 3,p. m. 

 4, c. 1, i. i upon each side. 



SI 



Dr- L. also exhibited three inferior molars of the Rhinoceros occidentalis,f 

 of which the posterior measured seventeen lines antero-poslerioily, and ten 

 lines transversely ; the others about fourteen lines antero-posteriorly, and ten 

 lines transversely. 



Dr. Fisher offered the following, which was adopted. 



y^eso/tW, That an invitation be sent by the Secrt tary, througli the 

 Dean of each of the four Medical Colleges, of this city, to the studfents 

 attending lectures at the re.-pective institutions, to visit the 3Iuseura of 

 the Academy on Tuesdays and Fridays, (public days.) and to inform 

 them that they will be admitted upon exhibitng their matriculation 

 tickets. 



Mr. Vaux offered the followintr, which was also adopted. 



Resn/vcd, That the Committee appointed at a meeting of the 

 Academy, held May 10th, 1?<51, to select a Biographer of the late Dr. 

 Morton, be requested to obtain a suitable place for hearing the Memoir 

 read, by Dr. Meigs, and to make such other arrangements as may be 

 requisite.

Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



Mr. Lea read a p.iper on the genus Acostsea of D'Orbigny, a new 

 fresh water mollusc of the order Dhnyaria, from the river Guadua, 

 New Granada. 



Mr. Lea considers this shell as one of the most remarkable and interesting 

 which has ever come under his notice. The fact that it is in its young state a 

 free limusculose shell, and in its mature state an affixed unirmtsculose shell, 

 places it among the anomalies which zoologists find it difficult to understand, 

 but which, in this case, points out its true position in a natural arrangement. 

 Mr. Lea expressed his convictions that this shell, now so well described by M. 

 D'Orbigny, belonged to the same genus which Ferussac described ia 1823, in 

 Mem. of the Soc. Nat. Hist., Vol. 1, under the name of Mulleria, if it be not of 

 the same species, a single specimen (adult) of which had then only been seen_ 

 Ferussac, considering the general resemblance of Mulleria to Ostrea, thought it 

 ought to be put alongside of, if not in, the latter genus. Brongniart and Latreille 

 thought it ought to go between Spondylus and Area. Other authors had as- 

 signed it to various positions, while some doubted whether it was anything more 

 than a malformation. The perfect specimen, in its junior and adult state, if it 

 be Mulleria, now banish all difficulties. Mr. Lea thinks now, in placing Mul- 

 leria (Acosta>a) in its true position, at the head of the order Monomi/aria, where 

 it makes the link with Dimyaria, it forms an easy transition from the first to 

 the second order. Thus retaining the trace of one while it passes so curiously 

 into the other. Nihil per saltum. 



Mr. Lea, under the impression that D'Orbigny's Acostsea Guaduasana may 

 prove to be a distinct species from the shell described by Ferussac, under the 

 generic name of Mulleria, while it may belong to the same genus, proposes to 

 give the name of that distinguished zoologist to it. That of Giia'duasana 

 should be retained of course for D'Orbigny's species. The genus would then 

 represent Mulleria Ferussacii, and Mulleria Guaduasana. 



The paper being intended for publication in the Journal, was re- 

 ferred to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Ruschenberger, and Dr. Wilson. 



Dr. Fisher, on behalf of the Committee on the Memoir of Dr. 

 Morton, reported that they had selected the Hall of the University of 

 Pennsylvania, and had appointed the first Thursday in November as 

 the time for hearing the Memoir read by Dr. Meigs, provided the con- 

 sent of the Trustees of the University could be had, notice of which

])r. Lcidy exhibited three broken teeth, consistinpj of the body of a 

 canine and that of two posterior niniars, which, he observed, were 

 fossils from Nebraska Territory, and belonL^ed to an animal closely 

 allied to the genus I'rsus. The tubercles upon the crown of the molars 

 Sire more elevated and conoidal than in the recent bears, and the 

 crown of the canine is relatively more robust. He proposed for the 

 animal the nan)e of Arctodon. 



])r. L. staled tliat he was preparin"; a memoir, in which would be 

 f^escribcd in detail all the fossil remains of 3Iammalia from Nebraska 

 Territory, heretofore characterized by him in the Proceedings. 



I]e next presented for exaniinaton a species of fresh- water sponge 

 fouiid firowing in the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, in the vicinity 

 of Philadelphia, which he characterized as ibllows : 



Spongilla fkagilis. — Discoidal, lichenoid, growing in patches, flat, oval or 

 circular, lobate at the margin, translucent, yellowish-white or cream-colored. 

 AreolfB distinct, aubcircular. Pieprodnctive bodies arranged in a single close 

 layer at the base of attachment of the sponge, shining, whitish-yellow, elevated 

 into a central papilla upon the upper surface. 



Measurements. — From ^ to 2 inches in diameter by 1 to lo lines in thickness 

 at the centre and gradually thinning off to the margin. 



IlabHalion. — Grows upon the under side of stones below low water mark in 

 the Kivers Delaware and Schuylkill. 



Structure. — Composed of an irtertesture of spicula about l-400th of an 

 inch long, having a minutely tubcrculated surface, over which is reflected a 

 grflnulo-cellular membrane. 



Remarks. — After the death of the spong°, the areolated tissue macerates off, 

 leaving the reproductive bodies in a close layer attached to the rock. The 

 living sponge is never green, nor does it ever grow exposed to the light. 



Dr. L. further s'ated that another species of fresh-water sponge is not un- 

 common in our rivers, which prows ex])osed to the light, and is green in color 

 like the European Spongilla fluviatilis, but whether it is specifically distinct 

 from the laittr, he Las not yet ascertained.

Uistorical Sketch of Gordiacece. 



By Charles Girard. 



I. 



There are groups, among the invertebrates of the animal kingdom, whose 

 natural history has made but little progress, although known to science for 

 more than half a century. 



The animals of which they are composed being generally of a diminutive size, 

 modest in form, modest in colors, have been looked at with indifference, thought 

 unworthy of a careful investigation, and deemed of too small an importance 

 in a general system of classification. 



Every living being, however, is entitled to occupy a rank in the creation ; 

 every one has its place, its aim, and its design. 



Yet some are called enigmatic, paradoxical, doubtful, — as if to the Creator's 

 mind, any thing or any being could be either an enigma, a paradox, or a doubt. 

 Such groups, we must acknowledge, present great difficulties to investigators : 

 but let investigators be patient and laborious, and they will gradually sweep 

 away the enigmas, the paradoxes, and the doubts. 



When the researches on a group are slow, and embrace a long period, then 

 it becomes necessary, for the safe and future advancement of its natural his- 

 tory, to recapitulate all the data in their chronology. These data will become 

 a guide into the various desiderata for new observations. 



Most diverse opinions are still entertained concerning Gordiacea;, and im- 

 portant zoological questions are still waiting the results of future investigations. 



Are Gordiaceae indigeneous in America, or introduced from abroad? If 

 they are indigenous amongst us, are they identical with, or specifically dif- 

 ferent from, the European species ? 



Here commences a labor of comparison between the internal structure and 

 external appearance of specimens from both countries. Besides specimens from 

 all the localities of one country should be compared, in order to ascertain the 

 number of species. Their embryology and metamorphosis must be traced ; 

 their habits recorded, in order to enable us to assign a natural position to that 

 family in the class of worms. 



If they are introduced on this continent, how, where, and how long since, 

 did that event take place? What is their geographical distribution and pro- 

 gressive migration to the places where they are now found ? 



Some facts which we already possess, and which are related hereafter, rather 

 enforce the belief of their aboriginal nature, than that of their introduction. 

 Even in the case of an identity between the American and European Gordiace;e, 

 these worms still deserve special attention from American anatomists, as the 

 latter might be successful in elucidating the controverted anatomical questions 

 which divide the naturalists of the old world. 



II. 

 The genus Gordius was established by 0. F. Miiller during the last century.* 

 Under that name were included aquatic worms, others living in moist grounds, 



* Vermium terrestrium et fluviatilium historia, 1173, 




280 [October, 



and still others, more numerous, found as parasites in the body of other animals. 

 Those which lead a permanent parasitical life, constitute now the genus Filaria, 

 of the same author,* which has been admitted by all subsequent naturalists, 

 and more than forty species of these are described by Rudolphi.f Hut there 

 has been a general belief, that the only difference between Gordius and Filaria 

 consisted in their habits, no zoological characters having as yet been detected. 



LamarckJ even says, that the species of Gordius were probably Filaria- ; and 

 if he has kept those two genera, it was merely in accordance with a prevailing 

 practice. 



Cuvierl] places Gordii at the end of the annelids, thus made to follow the 

 leeches, remarking, however, that they might perhaps come nearer the intestinal 

 worms. He was unacquainted with the fact, since ascertained, that several 

 species of true Gordius may be found, at a certain season of the year, within 

 the body of other animals. 



The genus Filaria is placed, by the same author, at the head of intestinal 

 worms. Its characters are derived from the external appearance, which, how- 

 ever, he (Cuvier) acknowledges resembles closely that of Gordius. 



Should a generic difference hereafter be found between Gordius and Filaria, 

 in their anatomical structure, and we think it very likely to be the case, be- 

 sides the difference of embyronic development which already distinguishes 

 them, we shall have that peculiarity in their habits which makes Filaria to 

 occur in such cavities of the body of other animals having no communication 

 with the exterior, whilst Gordii, when occasionally found within other animals, 

 occur in the intestinal canal; that is to say, in a cavity which communicates 

 directly with the surrounding medium. This fact is of no small importance. 



Tlie letter of Mr. Jacobson, to de Blainville,§ relates to Filaria, and not to 

 Gordius, as its title would lead any one to believe. 



Mr. Charvet,*[ in describing two species of true Gordius, thinks that these 

 worms are indifferently external and internal, and that the distinction made 

 between Filaria and Gordius becomes thus insignificant. But he is inclined 

 to believe that, if it can be proved that Filarite have a mouth provided with a 

 sucking apparatus, the character would be generic. He was not prepared, by 

 direct observation, to decide upon this fact. 



Leon Dufour** alludes to Gordii, and rejects the idea of an identity between 

 them and Filariae, considering the first as true Annelids, and the second as true 

 Entozoa; there existing, he says, a mere external resemblance, which can 

 only be proved to depend on identity of structure by anatomical investigations.

1851.] 281 



Prof. Siebold* speaks of Filarue of various kinds of insects, resembling 

 Gordii, which lived for some time in clear water, in which they had been 

 placed. He afterwards discovered the factf that sexes of Gordii were individ- 

 ualized, and males more numerous than females ; and, withdrawing Gordii 

 from Entozoa, he places them actually among Annelids. Subsequently J he 

 makes of Gordii a separate family, including also, the genus Mermis of Dujar- 

 din ; the family he calls Gordiace.s, differing cuiefly from that of Nematoidea 

 in its embryonic development. 



Entozoa have that peculiar mode of generation, in which several broods follow 

 each oiher, without resembling each other; nor will they resemble their parent 

 stock before the third, fourth, or fifth generation, according to the species. 



The young Gordiaceae resemble their parent as soon as hatched. There is, 

 however, not yet a single species of that family whose eggs have been made 

 the subject of a careful and complete study. Isolated facts only are known, 

 and to these we shall devote a few lines further on. 



There is a phenomenon, with which the naturalists of the old world are well 

 acquainted, which takes place during the existence of Gordiaccaj, (in Mermis 

 as well as in Gordius), it is the fact that they pass one part of their life within the 

 body of other animals, — of Grasshoppers and Crickets, for example. They are 

 found in the clear running waters of the meadows and fountains, early in the 

 spring and summer ; they enter the body of grasshoppers in the fall, where they 

 deposit their eggs. These insects die, and their bodies afford to these eggs a 

 convenient shelter during the winier, when the next spring they will hatch, and 

 become free again. || Eggs, however, are sometimes found without any such 

 nidus ; whether naturally or accidentally, remains to be ascertained. 



A. S. CErsted^ agrees with Prof. Siebold in making of Gordiaceai a separate 

 group amongst Nematoidea, on the ground of their embryonic development. 



Mr. Dujardin^ is remarkably short, and adds nothing to our knowledge on 

 these worms, which he still calls enigmatic. 



The manner in which Mr. Ecnile Blanchard** has illustrated the anatomical 

 structure of the other families of the intestinal worms, would lead us to expect 

 from that observer more precise facts repecting Gordioceae than those we had 

 before. But the author, at the outset, tells us that he was unable to fulfil the 

 task he had undartaken, that is, a complete history of that family. The want 

 of materials in such researches, added to the difficulty of experimenting, are 

 the reasons advanced to account for the deficiency in this part of his investi- 

 gations. The subject, therefore, stands precisely as it did before Mr. Blanchard 

 ■undertook his anatomical researches on the class of worms.

282 [October, 



The last European writer on this subject is Mr. Ed. Grube,* who has made 

 some observations on tlie develojjment of the egg of Gordius aquulicus, and 

 described a new species from Africa. His paper bears chiefly on minute para- 

 sitical nematoids. He also alludes to the great resemblance there is between 

 Mermis albicans AscarU acuminanta. 



III. 



The anatomical structure of Gordiaceae is also a matter of much controversy 

 amongst anatomists. 



Prof. Sieboldjf in giving an account of the difference between intestinal 

 worms and Gordii, again calls the latter enigmatic. 



Berthold| describes a system of circulation neither seen nor acknowledged 

 by the authors that came after him. He likewise mentions a nervous system ; 

 but giving no further account of it, its characters and distribution in the body 

 of these worms remain to be investigated. 



Dnjardin || is in a complete doubt. 



Prof. SieboId,§ in resuming Berthold's and Dujardin's investigation, says that 

 the organs which Berthold took for veins and arteries, are contracted fibres, 

 and that he has failed of seeing any organs which he could confidently call 

 nervous or vascular systems. 



We do not know yet the digestive tube of any Gordiacese. One fact, how- 

 over, is ascertained with regard to that organ : it atrophies in full grown indi- 

 viduals. Even the structure of the skin, or external envelope of the body, 

 deserves a more full comparative study. 



Although Charvet and Berthold agree in saying that Gordiacea; are androgy- 

 nous, it has been plainly ascertained since that the sexes are distinct. But 

 the structure of the sexual organs is not known. P.of. Siebold found an ex- 

 ternal character by which males differ from the females, the former, in G. 

 aquaticus, having a bifurcated tail. 



IV. 

 Some observations on the development of the eggs of Gordius aquaticus have 

 been made by Ed. Grube. ^ Dr. Joseph Leidy had made similar investigations 

 in 1846, and published only in 1850.*- The eggs are laid in strings, nearly of 

 the length, and sometimes the color, of the worm itself. Within those whitish 

 strings or cords are found the eggs. The division of the yolk takes place, ac- 

 cording to the general law of division of that substance, previous to the for^ 

 mation of the embryo. The embryo itself is gradually formed out of the yolk's 

 substance, in a manner similar to that in Clepsina;, and leeches in general. 

 The young resemble their parents as soon as hatched.

Youag Gordii possess two circles of filamentary appendages around the 

 proboscis, which, at this early period, is alternately protruded and retracted. 

 Whether the same motion and the same appendages are still present in the 

 adult state, is yet to be exaruined. Many worms are known to be provided wilh 

 a retractile proboscis, which they use in perforating the sand and mud in 

 which they live. Gordii might require it to introduce themselves into tho living 

 bodies where they are sometimes found. As to the circles of tentacles, they 

 very likely disappear in the adult, while the alimentary canal atrophies, their 

 function being intimately connected with the functions of the latter org>in. 



V. 



With regard to the species of Gordiaccie to be admitted, naturalists do not 

 any more agree. 



The most common in Europe is Gordius aquaticus, L.* The G. marinus and 

 G. annulatus of Montague, f are Nemertes. 



Mr. Charvet J describes two others, from the vicinity of Grenoble, (France,) 

 under two trivial names. 



Mr. Dujardin § considers as distinct, from the above, a species from the 

 vicinity of Toulouse, his Gordius Tolosanus, and describes another species, 

 proposing for it the genus Mermis, calling the species M. niyreacens. 



Prof. Siebold || has made us acquainted with a second species of Mermi?, his 

 M. albicans. 



Mr. Blanchard ^ has described one species from Chili, under the name of 

 G. Chilensis. 



Finally, Mr. Ed. Grube ** describes another from Africa, which he calls 

 Gordius crassus. 



Before we identify the North American Gordii with any of the above-mentioned 

 ones, we must be prepared to account for many objections which can be made, 

 respecting their having been created identical over such an extensive area, or 

 else of their having migrated naturally, or having been accidentally transported. 



VI. 



We have in the United States one species, which seems quite common in 

 fresh water, and referred by some to G. aquaticus. Rev. Z. Thompson, of Bur- 

 lington, (Vt.,) expresses himself in the following terms : " The little animal 

 called the Hair snake also belongs to this order, (annulata,) and to the genua

Goriiius. These pre very common in the still waters nnd mnd in all pnrts of 

 Ibe State. They are usually about the size of a large horse hair, and are froin 

 one to six or eight inches in length. In color they vary from pure white to 

 nearly black, and hence we probably have several species. The vulgar notion 

 that they originate from hairs which fall from horses and cattle, and become 

 animated in the water, would seem to be too absurd for contradiction ; and 

 yet, absurd as it is, people are to be found who believe it."* 



The same popular ojiiuion is prevailing in Europe. Gordii have been 

 noticed in the body of insects, also, by an American entomologis', I>r. Th. 

 AVm. Harris, who says: "I have taken three or four of these animals out of 

 the body of a single locust. "f They have been found, by other?, within the 

 cricket, (Acheta abbreviata). 



AVe saw a specimen, six or seven inches in length, caught in the clear 

 waters in the vicinity of Richmond, (Va.) Several others were detected by 

 Dr. Leidy in the neighborhood of Philadelphia. 



Finally, we may mention severa' specimens of Gordii from Oregon, brought 

 home by the U. S. exploring Expedition. 



Gordii, therefore, are spread all over the Western hemisphere.

2. Stylaria fossdlaris, Leidy. 



Body of two segments, composed of 24 annuli in the first, 22 to the last. Podal 

 spines 5 to 7 in each fasciculus. Seta3 commencing after the fifth annulus, 

 usually double, to l-66th in. long. Upper lip broad, demi-oval, compressed, 

 not emarginate, with a cylindroid, flexible, proboscidiform appendage the l-33d

 the mouth. Pharynx capacious, extending to the 7th annulus; oesophagus 

 cylindroid, tortuous, extending to the 7th annulus.

ANELCODISCUS, Genus novum. 

 Body cylindroid, smooth, posteriorly terminated by a cordiform, retractile 

 acetabular disk. Mouth and anus terminal. Intestine simple, straight, 



1. Anelcodiscus pellucidus, Leidy. 



Body cylindroid, colorless, transparent; anteriorly rounded, obtuse; poste- 

 riorly spreading into a codiform disk for attachment. Disk retractile : when 

 retracted, the body becoming dilated oval in the middle and the posterior part 

 doubly intussuscepted. 



Length 1-lOOthin. ; breadth 1-lOOOth inch. 



Habitation. Parasitic within the intestine of Stylaria fossularis. 



Remarks. From the translucency of the last mentioned worm, its parasite 

 may be seen within the intestine attached to the mucous membrane by means 

 of its posterior cordiform disk. While attached it alternately retracts its body 

 with a jerk, and then lengthens itself; in the former movement the posterior 

 third of the body becoming doubly intussuscepted, so as to have the appear- 

 ance of a double articulation. When detached the same movements take place, 

 but in that of retraction the codiform disk is entirely drawn within the animal's 

 body. More details of this curious parasite I did not obtain, for, although I 

 saw three, and removed them from the intestine of the Stylaria, yet their move- 

 ments were so active I could not study them to advantage, and to quiet them 

 I tried a minute portion of the vapor of chloroform, which instantly killed 

 them, but at the same moment they underwent total destruction. Since then 

 I. have not been able to examine others.

Mr. Lea announced the death of Richard Cowling Taylor, which 

 took place on Sunday morning, the 26th inst., at his residence in loth 

 street, in his 62d year, after a very short illness. 



Mr. Lea remarked, that it was very rarely that the members of the Academy 

 had to deplore so severe a loss as that sustained by the death of their distin- 

 guished fellow member Mr. Taylor. 



In his particular branch of Geology (economic-geology) he stood pre-eminent, 

 and as a mining engineer, no authority in this country, or, perhaps in Europe, 

 was superior to that of Mr. Taylor. By early education and association in Eng- 

 land, he became versed, in the most thorough manner, in these imi)ortant sci- 

 ences at an age when such education usually begins. Hence his first literary 

 productions brought him prominently before the learned world, and he was in- 

 troduced into literary and scientific societies, where he took an active part. The 

 first work of importance which he published, was one on the Monastic remains 

 of the county in which his father lived as a country gentleman, and on whose 

 property there was a noted Anglo-Norman ruin. It was this probably that in- 

 duced Mr. Taylor first to turn his attention to this branch of knowledge, and 

 the result was the "Index Monasticus, in the ancient kingdom of East Anglia," 

 published in 1821, in 1 vol. folio,* which at once gave him a reputation for 

 thorough investigation and exactness, which noted all his after works, and 

 which has rarely been excelled. This work was received with so much favor 

 that Dr. Taylor was induced, at the request of the publishers, to undertake 

 that thorough and learned work which he called a " General Index to Dougdale's 

 Monasticon Anglicanum," in I vol. folio, with plates and maps, which was pub- 

 lished in 1830. This took Mr. Taylor two years to complete, and was said to 

 be so perfect as to require nothing further to be added in regard to it. In his 

 profession, he had the great advantage of a most thorough and complete educa- 

 tion, and he was associated in business with the late Wm. Smith, who has been 

 considered as "the father of British Geology," on account of his having been 

 the first geologist in England who attempted to classify the rocks of that country 

 by their characteristic fossils; and who was said to have preceded MM. Cuvier 



*At a public sale his private copy, with some notes, brought £30. 




1851.] ' 291 



aad Brongniart in that important step, which gave such an impulse to this 

 great branch of human knowledge. Under such auspices, aud by his assidious 

 application, Mr. Taylor made the most rapid advances in the art of Mining and 

 the Science of Geology. The early relation* of this intercourse ripened into a 

 friendship, and sincere mutual regard, which lasted throngh life. 



With such acquirements, he was soon called into active employment, and 

 we find him engaged, for a time, in the importait ordinance survey of Eng- 

 laud, and he was also employed by the " British Iron Company," whose ex- 

 tensive and valuable property in South "Wales, he investigated and reported 

 upon. That portion of the Ordinance Survey which he executed, was fin- 

 ished in a most masterly manner, and his drafts were of the most exact and 

 perfect kind. His report of the topography and geology of the mineral lands 

 of the British Iron Company, were so admirably executed, that the Geologi- 

 cal Society of London published the map and descriptive parts in its Trans • 

 actions. In connection with this, he executed a model in plaster of that part 

 of Wales,* which received so much approbation, that the Society of Arts 

 awarded to him their gold his Medal, which is now in possession of his family. 

 Subsequently to this, he was engaged for some years, in England, in the ex- 

 amination of various mining properties, after which he was induced to ac- 

 cept an appointment by Hardman Phillips, Esq., an intimate friend of the 

 family, to remove to this country, and reside in Phillipsburg, Pennsylvania, 

 where he remained four years, under the expectation of the professional em- 

 ployment promised him there. This was an unfortunate movement for him- 

 self and family, which now consisted of a wife and four daughters. Having 

 lost, in this residence, both time and money, he removed to Philadelphia, for 

 the purpose of seeking that employment in his profession in which he was so 

 well qualified to excel. Previous to this, however, he was engaged in the 

 survey of the Bossburgh District, and the line of railroad, which he completed, 

 and made an extensive and able report in 1832. 



It was after this time, in 1834, Mr. Lea first became personally acquainted 

 with Mr. Taylor, which acquaintance immediately grew into a friendship, 

 which increased through life. Shortly after this, Mr. Lea had it in his power 

 to have Mr. Taylor placed in charge of the exploration of the extensive coal 

 and iron property of the Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Co., in Dauphin 

 county, Pa., in which Mr. Lea had a large interest. Here Mr. Taylor remained 

 about three years, and developed the mineral resources of this extensive min- 

 eral district, to the entire satisfaction of the Board of Directors. The whole 

 of the lands embraced 42,000 acres, in a rugged, mountainous district, which 

 required an experience and perseverance which few men had more of than 

 Mr. Taylor. The result of this great labor was an elaborate report, of 187 

 pages in Svo., together with about 150 maps, drafts, surveys and sections, 

 which are invaluable to the Company, and in whose possession they now are. 

 In connection with this, during a period of cessation, in this country, of acti- 

 vity in such works, he employed himself in the execution of a model 6i this 

 part of the coal basin and its surrounding mountains, which occupied him 

 many months. This subsequently became the property of the Dauphin Com- 

 pany. It embraces in length about 45 miles, and in breadth 15 miles of the

district it represents, and is about 14 feet long. It is a complete geolo;;ical 

 and topographical rei)rescntulion of this important district, and would be 

 alone a monument lo a man of science, if be had never executed any other 

 labor. 



As soon as the mining interests of the country had become relieved from 

 the pressure which had prevailed for a few years, he again was called on to 

 explore and investigate many mineral districts, connected with the working 

 of gold, silver, lead, copper, coal, aspbaltum, &c. Most of these reports were 

 published, and it is believed that, in every case, they were so correctly exe- 

 cuted as to leave no doubt in the minds of those who employed him, as to his 

 judgment, bis candor and bis scrupulous representations of that which he was 

 employed to examine. It was one of the characteristics of Mr. Taylor, as all 

 his intimate friends were perfectly aware, that his openness and frankness 

 were such as to induce him never to hesitate to express a candid opinion, or 

 to make known a fact, however much it might be against his own interests. 

 It was this which induced the most unbounded reliance, among his friends, 

 on his representations. Beside the numerous engagements he had in various 

 States, he frequently had calls to examine important mines in other parts of 

 America; the copper mines of Cuba, the gold mines of Panama, the aspbal- 

 tum of New Brunswick, &c. In Cuba he was employed to examine and re- 

 port on the vein of aspbaltum near Havana, of which he published an account 

 in the Trans, of the Am. Phil. Soc, with a plan and section. The last work 

 of this kind he was engaged in, was the examination of the injected vein of 

 aspbaltum at Hillsborough, in the Province of New Brunswick, which is now 

 in litigation. His testimony in this case, as taken down, and since publi.=hed, 

 is a specimen of such thorough knowledge in his profession, such clearness, 

 exactness and completeness, as to be worthy of all praise. It should have a 

 place in all geological libraries. He was greatly interested in this singular 

 litigation, which seems, strange as it may appear to geologists and mineralo- 

 gists, to depend on the decision of a jury, whether an injected vein of aspbal- 

 tum be not a seam or bed of bituminous coal, belonging to true coal mea- 

 sures! Nothing could be more clear, nor more to the point, than Mr. Tay- 

 lor's evidence to the contrary. While in the examination of various districts, 

 in his professional employment, he carefully noted every fact connected with 

 general geology and palaeontology, and the results were generally given in 

 the form of papers to scientific bodies, and pflblished in their Transactions. 

 These will be found in various learned transactions in England and this 

 country — particularly in those of the Am. Phil. Soc, the Acad, of Nat. Sci- 

 ences, and the Geological Soc. of Penn., on this side of the Atlantic. They 

 all bear internal evidence of a philosophic mind, schooled in the considera- 

 tion of philosophical facts. 



Notwithstanding what has been said in regard to all these labors of a most 

 industrious life, the reputation of Mr. Taylor will rest chiefly on a work which 

 has not yet been mentioned — his " Slatistics of Coal," published in this city, 

 in 8vo. pp. '754, in 1848. It included the geographical and geological distri- 

 bution of mineral combustibles or fossil fuel, as well as notices of localities 

 of the various mineral bituminous substances employed in arts and manu- 

 factures, illustrated by maps and diagrams, embracing, from ofiBcial reports 

 of the great coal-producing countries, the respective amounts of their produc- 

 tion, consumption, and commercial distribution, in all parts of the world. 




1851.] 293 



The execution of this work had engaged Mr. Taylor's time, not necessarily- 

 devoted to the practice of his profession, during many years of his life. His 

 heart was set upon the completion of it, and when approaching to a conclu- 

 sion it drew his mind from all other pursuits. While it was going through 

 the press, he became so ill that, for many weeks, his physician and his family 

 had little expectation of his living to see it completed. During this period 

 many of the sheets had to pass through the press without his inspection, 

 which fact naturally produced some errors. When the work reached the 

 hands of those interested in the statistics of coal, its geology, and its geo- 

 graphical distribution, it was received with the most entire satisfaction. His 

 intimate friends were the first to congratulate him on the work he had 

 achieved, and the criticisms of the press soon followed with their share of 

 approbation. Dr. Fitton, the distinguished geologist, reviewed it in the 

 Edinburgh Review, and gave to its author the credit he so well deserved, of 

 which the following is a single paragraph. 



"The inquiries of the author have been extended, with marvellous industry 

 and perseverance, to every part of the globe ; but, as might be expected of an 

 engineer residing in America, the coal tracts of that country naturally occupy 

 a large portion of the work. As these are probably less knowu, to most of 

 our readers, than the coal producing states of Europe, while they are beyond 

 all comparison the greatest depositories of coal in the world — affording to 

 that fortunate region the prospect of almost unbounded wealth — we shall 

 confine our attention chiefly to this part of the work. But our readers may 

 be assured that the author's account of other countries gives equal proofs of 

 his diligence in collecting information." 



The London, Edhihuryh and Dublin Phil. Mag. and Jour, of Science, in its no- 

 tice of this work, says, "comprehensive as the title of this work appears, it 

 does not yet convey a just idea of its scope, or the extent of the subject mat- 

 ter. Did its title stand, ^ Coal the civilizer ; its natural history, productions 

 and applications,' it would perhaps convey to the casual reader a more just 

 idea of the object and contents of the work." * * *. "Along and inti- 

 mate practical acquaintance with mines and mining operations in different 

 parts of the world, had necessarily led him to amass a great quantity of ma- 

 terial; the value of which, as a constant object of reference for his own use, 

 led him to feel the utility of a digested and methodized arrangement of those 

 materials, in a permanent shape, for the use of others. But there is found, 

 throughout these pages, a pervading spirit beyond that merely materialistic 

 and dry one which the title would indicate, and which the professional 

 engagements of the author might have led us to anticipate. We perceive, 

 impressed on every section, the idea, not of coal the mere wealth producer, the 

 mere material instrument of the human animal, but of coal as an important 

 agent in promoting civilization. It is in the same spirit, and imbued with 

 the same everywhere pervading high moral sentiment, that the author more 

 than once calls attention to the vastly greater importance of iron than of 

 gold and silver. We cannot conclude without cordially recommending this 

 work to the attention of our readers. While it will be an invaluable book of 

 reference to every future inquirer into the numerous economic questions con- 

 nected with our most important industrial operations and manufactures, and 

 into the great social questions arising out of them, it will form an indispen- 

 sable part of the library of every geologist."

2^4 [October 



The London Athenreum in its notice says, "The work of Mr. Taylor will 

 command attention, and liccome standard as a reference; especially as it is 

 the only one which endeavors to concentrate the knowledge diffused through 

 so many channels, and often attainable only in the countries to which the 

 statistics refer." 



The press in this country did not withhold its jiroper appreciation of a 

 work so important to the great coal and iron interests this side the Atlantic. 



In the notice in Silliman's Journal it is said, "It is a suflicient guarantee 

 for its completeness and accuracy on all points on which it touches, that it 

 received, before publication, the highest and most unqualified praise at one 

 of the meetings of the American Association of Geologists and Naturalists." 

 * * * "An examination of the volume, now that it has appeared from the 

 press, gives us a still higlier opinion of the talents and industry of its author, 

 and the great value of his labors," &c. The Journal of the Franklin Institute 

 stated it could scarcely have been thought possible that one individual, espe- 

 cially in this country, could have collected together such a mass of facts, and 

 made of them so well arranged and so delightful a book. Hunt's Merchants' 

 Magazine says, " We venture to say that, on no kindred subject has a more 

 complete or perfect treatise ever been produced." 



Beside the proficiency which Mr. Taylor had acquired in economic geology, 

 he had devoted himself much to theoretic geology, and his knowledge of the 

 various formations, which make the sum of the geological series, was rarely 

 excelled by his colleagues. He had devoted himself more particularly to the 

 strata connected with the coal formation, and he was the first person, as 

 Prof. Silliman stated, to a meeting of the American Association of Geologists, 

 who had referred the old Red Sandstone, underlying the coal of this State, to 

 its true position, corresponding with its place in the series of European rocks. 

 He was unwilling to engage in State surveys, but his aid was sometimes re- 

 quired to assist in those particular branches in which he so much excelled. 

 With this view he for a short time lent his services to the New York State 

 Survey. 



In the year 1832 he was elected a member of this Academy, and in 1846 a 

 life membership was conferred upon him, "as a mark of respect and a just 

 appreciation of its means of usefulness derived from him." His attachment 

 to the Academy increased with his advancing years. He frequently made 

 donations to it of specimens and books. Very recently, he presented a most 

 elaborate geological table in manuscript, colored to represent the different 

 strata, and combining the analogous nomenclature of various systems. This 

 most valuable donation was made to the Academy on condition of its never 

 being taken from the library, and it cannot fail to be most useful for consul- 

 tation and reference. 



At the time of his death, Mr. Taylor was engaged in preparing a paper, for 

 the Journal of the Academy, on the fossil plants which he had discovered in 

 his recent visit to New Brunswick. The fossil fishes which he also discov- 

 ered there, he left with his friend Prof. Agassiz, who was to describe the new 

 ones for him. All these Mr. Taylor intended should be deposited in the col- 

 lection of this Academy, to which he had already added many valuable spe- 

 cimens. 



Mr. Taylor was the third son of Samuel Taylor, of New Buckenham, in Nor- 

 folk, England, and a descendant of Dr. John Taylor, the author of the Hebrew 

 Concordance. He was born at Banham, in Norfolk, Jan. 18th, 1789. His bro- 




1851.] 295 



thers and cousins were men generally distinguished by their great literary and 

 scientific acquirements. His younger brother, Edgar Taylor, -was a distin- 

 guished member of the legal profession in London, and an accomplished scholar. 

 He was the author of several works, and remarkable for his numerous learned 

 reviews, published in the most prominent periodicals in Great Britain. His 

 cousin, Richard Taylor, is the well-known and able editor of the Philosophical 

 Magazine, which has been the leading scientific Journal of England for the 

 last 25 years. John and Phillip are equally distinguished as mining engineers. 

 The great services Mr. Taylor had rendered science have been acknowledged, 

 by his being made a member of the principal Societies in England and this 

 country, which embraced those branches of knowledge which he cultivated. 

 He was elected a member of the Geological Society of London, and of the 

 Society of Civil Engineers, of that city. In this country he was a member of 

 this Academy, as before mentioned ; of the American Philosophical Society ; 

 of the Geological Society of Pennsylvania ; of the American Association of 

 Geologists and Naturalists, of the Franklin Institute, &c., &c. 



In a rapid survey of Mr. Taylor's scientific labors, it would be difficult to give 

 anything more than a brief and imperfect list of his writings. In this sketch 

 will not be introduced his professional reports, which occupied the chief part 

 of his life, and which were generally executed in such a systematic and perfect 

 manner, as to remain models, worthy of imitation by all engaged in such works. 

 Whether his beautiful map of the Ordinance Survey, executed in 1813 — 14, was 

 the first, is not certain, but it seems to bear the earliest date. He subsequently 

 published, in the Trans. Geological Society of London, " Notice of two Models 

 and Sections of about eleven square miles, forming a part of the Mineral Basin 

 of South Wales, in the vicinity of Pontypool," (1830). " On the Crag Strata at 

 Bramerton, near Norwich," (1823). " On the Alluvial Strata, and on the Chalk 

 of Norfolk and Suffolk, and on the Fossils by which they are accompanied," 

 (1823). In the Magazine of Natural History he published, in 1829, a paper 

 called the "Progress of Geology," which was followed, in 1830, by another, the 

 "Introduction to Geology," which was succeeded by " Illustrations of Antedi- 

 luvian Zoology and Botany." These papers were illustrated with many beauti- 

 ful drawings and sections, and were published before he came to America. 

 His first papers published in this country were, it is believed, in the Trans, of 

 the Geological Society of Pennsylvania, with the following titles : — " On the 

 Geological position of certain beds, which contain numerous Fpssil Marine 

 Plants of the family Fucoides, near Lewistown, Mifflin county. Pa.," (1834). 

 " On the relative position of the Transition and Secondary Coal Formations in 

 Pennsylvania, and description of some transition or Bituminous, Anthracite, 

 and Iron ore beds, near Broad Top Mountain, in Bedford county, and of a 

 coal vein in Perry county, Pennsylvania, with sections." " Notices of the 

 evidences of the existence of an ancient Lake, which appears to have formerly 

 filled the Limestone Valley of Kishacoquillas, in Mifflin county, Penna." " On 

 the Mineral Basin or Coal Field of Blossburg, on the Tioga River, 'Tioga 

 county, Penn." "Memoir of a section passing through the Bituminous Coal 

 Field near Richmond, in Virginia." " Review of the Geological phenomena, 

 and the deductions derivable therefrom, in 250 miles of sections, in parts of 

 Virginia and Maryland. Also, notice of certain Fossil Acotyledonous Plants 




29G [October, 



in the secondary strata of Fredcricksbnrg/' (Vir.) In tlie Transactions of 

 the American Philosophical Society, he published " Memoir of tiie Ciiaracter 

 and Prospects of the Cojjper Repion of Gibara, and a .Sketch of the Geology 

 of the X. E. part of tlic Island of Cuba." "Notice of Fossil Arborescent Ferns 

 of the Family Sigillaria and otiier Coal Plants, exhibited in the Roof and 

 Floor of a Coal Seam in Dauphin county, Penn." " Notice of a Vein of Bitu-

 ing of two teeth, two' vertebra, a fragment of a rib and an ungual phalanx, 

 presented to the Academy October 21st, by Mr. Robert H. Nash, who obtained 

 them from the Miocene formation of Westmoreland county, Virginia. Dr. 

 Leidy found them to belong to a new extinct species of Crocodile, for which 

 he proposed the name of Crocodilus antiquus. 



Mr. Theodore F. Moss read some remarks on the Geology of Texas. 



Dr. Fisher announced that the Trustees of the University of 

 Pennsylvania had granted the use of the College Hall to the Acad- 

 emy, for the purpose of hearing the Memoir of the late Dr. Morton

 Librarv of that institution. 



Froiii Dr. J. L. Jiiirtt. U. S. N., dated U. S. Naval Hospital, 

 New York, November 8th, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of his 

 notice of election as a ]\Iember. 



Dr. Leidy presented a list of minerals offered by the Bavarian 

 Government, and also a list of minerals of this country desired by 

 the same in exchange. Keferred to the Mineralogical Committee. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to some fossil bones from the 

 Miocene formation of Virginia, which he characterized as having belonged to 

 two species of Whale, as follows : — 



Balakna palvEatlantica, Leidy. This species is proposed upon a fragment 

 of a lower jaw, a dorsal vertebra, and the zygomatic portion of the temporal 

 bone. The specimens were discovered by Dr. R. Eppes in Virginia, and pre- 

 sented to Prof. W. E. Horner, to whom they belong. They were found in 

 association with Pecten Jeffersonius, Venus tridacnoides, etc. The fragment 

 of lower jaw, 8J inches long, is stout in its proportions, is relatively straight, 

 with no tendency to curve downwards. In section it is vertically ellipsoid, 

 but becomes more cylindroid anteriorly. Internally it is convex, e.\ternally 

 demicylindroid. The upper margin is elevated, obtuse, and irregular. Just 

 within it, in the specimen, situated about two inches apart, are three gingeval 

 foramina, about four lines in diameter, and slightly oblique forwards in their 

 direction. External to the upper margin at the anterior half of the specimen, 

 about one inch apart, are two large labial foramina, one four lines, the other 

 five lines in diameter, directed very obliquely forward. 



Measurements of the fragment.

Vertical diameter, 4J inches, Z\ inches. 



Transverse " 2% " 3 " 10 lines. 



The dorsal vertebra, indicates an adult animal. Its articular faces are flat 

 and compressed circular. The transverse processes and neural arch are 

 broken away.

Balaena pbisca, Leidy. This species is proposed upon a fragment of a lower 

 jaw and a caudal vertebra, found in association with Crocodilus antiquus, 

 Pectea Jeffersonius, &c., in Westmoreland county, Virginia. The specimens 

 were obtained by Mr. Robert H. Nash, and presented by him to the Academy. 



The fragment of lower jaw, fourteen inches long, is of much more slender pro- 




1851.] 309 



portions than that of the preceding, it is also more uniform in its breadth and 

 depth, and has a strong curve downwards as in B. rorqual, Lac. It is very 

 nearly flat internally and demi-cylindrical externally. The upper margin is 

 angular but not prominent, and forms the boundary between the inner and 

 outer side. The gingeval foramina, five in number in the specimen, are placed 

 below the upper margin internally, are about one line in diameter, and open 

 very obliquely forward into grooves almost honzontal, from half an inch to 

 one inch long. The labial foramina of which there are the remains of seven 

 in the specimen, are about half an inch external to the upper margin, are about 

 two lines in diameter, and open very obliquely forward. 



Measurements of the fragment. 



Vertical diameter, ..... 3 inches. 



Transverse " . . . . . 2 " 



The caudal vertebra found associated with the above fragment, and which I 

 suppose to belong to the same animal, is adult, and indicates a larger species 

 ihan the B. palseatlantica, for it is as large as the dorsal vertebra of the latter. 

 Its articular faces are subcircular, and are moderately convex. The transverse 

 processes and neural arch are broken away in the specimen, as is also the 

 case with the abutments of the chevron bone. The transverse processes have 

 their origin 1| inches posterior to the anterior articular face.

Dr.Fisher, on behalf of theCommittee on the Memoir of Dr.Morton, 

 announced that it had been read by Dr. Meigs on Thursday evening 

 last, Nov. 6th, 1851, at the Hall of the University of Pennsylvania. 



Whereupon the following resolutions were offered, and unani- 

 mously adopted : — 



Resolved, That the sincere thanks of this Society are due, and are 

 hereby presented to Dr. Charles D. Meigs, for his able and highly 

 appropriate Memoir of its late President, Dr. Samuel George Morton, 

 read before the Society on the 6th inst., at the Hall of the University 

 of Pennsylvania. 



Resolved, That the Memoir be published, and that the Committee 

 on Proceedings have charge ot the same. 



November 18th, ' 



Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



A letter was read from the Asiatic Society of Bengal, dated Cal- 

 cutta, May 9th, 1851, acknowledging the receipt of Part 1, Vol. 2, 

 neAv series of the Journal. 




310 [November, 



Dr. Leidy resid a paper, intended for publication in tiie Proceed- 

 ing.'', entitled "On .some American Fresh water Polyzoa." 



Also a second paper, intended for j)ublication in the Journal, 

 entitled "Description of a new species of fossil Crocodile." 



Both c(;mmunications were referred to the following Committee, 

 Dr. Ruschenberger, Dr. Fisher, and Dr. Le Conte. 



Mr. Lea read a letter from Mr. Edward Miller, giving the locali- 

 ties of the coal fossils presented by him this evening. 



Mr. Lea also made some remarks on the scenery and geological 

 characters of the White Mountains. 



The tbllowing resolution was unanimously adopted: — 



Hesolved, That the thanks of tliis Society be presented to Dr. E. K. 

 Kane, for the valuable donations made by him to the ]\Iuseum of 

 the Academy, of specimens of ^s'atural History collected during his 

 recent voyage to the Arctic Regions.

Zoological yotes. 



By John L. Le Conte, M. D. 



During a visit to Panama, in December, 1849, 1 had frequent occasion to observe 

 many animals of such frail texture, as to render impossible any attempt to pre- 

 serve them, and took many notes respecting their appearance and habits. By an 




1851.] 317 



accident, my manuscript, while being sent home, was rendered nearly illegible, 

 and I am new able to recover only a few fragments of it. I have thought that 

 the animals observed were of sufficient importance to warrant the publication 

 of my notes, although not relating to the subjects of my own special re- 

 searches. 



I had intended to prefix a few observations respecting the geographical dis- 

 tribution of organic beings on the Isthmus, but haviig recently received through 

 the kindness of friends, collections which serve to make a more minute com- 

 parison between the productions of different parts of the year, I will postpone 

 for the present, the discussion of the phenomena observed, and merely state a 

 single fact which appears to me of great importance, in considerations regard- 

 ing the limit of the effects of physical causes. During the month of December 

 I labored assiduously to procure a set of the Coleoptera of the vicinity of Pan- 

 ama, and was surprised, on looking over my collection, to find a complete ab- 

 sence of the genera known to be confined to the tropics. In fact, with the ex- 

 ception of half a dozen Chrysomelines, there was not a single species which 

 might not have come from a region far north of the tropics. It is known that 

 in the southern part of the temperate zone, the Carabica, Brachelytra, water 

 beetles, &c., which first appear in the spring at northern localities, are most 

 abundant in winter, and this would be naturally explained by the fact that 

 the temperature in that season is most nearly akin to that of the regions in 

 which they flourish best. But it is a little alarming for the doctrine of physi- 

 cal causes, to find that the same arrangement in the appearance of species is 

 kept up in a region where climate can have nothing to do in producing these 

 phenomena. 



Ophiolepis Mull. 



O. ann ulata, disco squamis minimis imbricatis dense tecto, radialibus

Color grayish yellow ; disc brown with closely approximated pale spots ; 

 arms seven times as long as the diameter of the disc, with every fourth dorsal 

 plate dark ; the scales of the disc are very small and imbricated, the radial ones 

 scarcely larger, and widely separated. The oral plates are rounded on the later- 

 al angles, and are not surrounded with papillae ; but from the apex of each run 

 two rows of small papillae, which follow the inflexed margin of the fleshy partof 

 the disc. The oral papillae are distinct, four on each side. The tentacular pores 

 have each two small scales, the spines are arranged in three rows, their length 

 is equal to the diameter of the arms. This species apparently resembles 0. reti- 

 culata MuUer, 95. Ophiura reticulata Say(J. Ac. 5, 148,)but the spines are longer.

Pnle pray; arms markeiJ with scattcre<l brown spots. Oral plates not 8urroun<l- 

 etl with papilla', angles acute, the distal one truncate ; the posterior plate is 

 •listinguished by only a single marginal foramen. Tiie inflexed margin of the 

 disc is not margined with papilla; as in the preceding species; the oral papillae 

 are large, and there are only three on each side: the tentacalar pores have two 

 small oblong scales; the spines are in three rows, and their length is only one 

 half the diameter of the arms; the spinogof the middle row are rough. This spe- 

 cies seems very similar to O. elongata Mul. 95. Ophiura elony. Say J. Ac. 5, 14G.

Pale beneath, above blackish l)ro\vn : arms marked with a few paler bands ; 

 the scales are all finely granulated, the radial ones separated by two plates. 

 The oral j)lates are not surrounded with papilhe, and on each side there is only 

 a single oral papilla ; the tentacular pores are protected with single scales, the 

 second scale being spiniform and forming the lowest of the five series of lat- 

 eral spines, the longest of which is scarcely equal to the diameter of the arms.

 chiorum diametri fpquantibus; scutis buccalibus rhomboideis, postico foramine 

 apicali notato, brachiis disci diametro lO'es longioribus. Long. 6 unc. 



Only a single specimen found very distinct by the hispid surface of the disc. 

 The oral plates have ou each side 3 or 4 tolerably large papillae. The tentacu- 

 lar pores have two small elliptical scales. 



Besides the species described above, a large one was given me by Dr. Du- 

 chassaing, which strongly resembles 0. serpentaria, from the West Indies. The 

 dorsal plates of the arms were a little more transverse, and the buccal plates 

 more rounded. Not having had sufficient opportunity for examining whether 

 these should he considered as specific differences, I forbear for the present ex- 

 pressing an opinion on this specimen. 



Ophiothrix Mul.

 alibus rotundatis, externo acuminato, brachiis diametro 6ies longioribus. Long. 

 4 — 5 unc. 



This species is very variable as regards the closeness of the numerous short 




1851.] 319 



serrate spicuire which clothe the disc ; the radial plates are more or less dis- 

 tinct, sometimes nearly free from spicule; they are large and granulate, the 

 angle which is above the base of the arm nearly touches the corresponding 

 angle of the next plate, and is whitish. The oral plates are wider than long, 

 with the oral angle distinct and the lateral angles rounded ; the apex is acu- 

 minate. The inner series of plates bounding the oral plates is very narrow. 

 The brachial spines are arranged in 7 rows, the two inferior ones being the 

 shortest; the others are about twice as long as the diameter of the arm, and 

 serrate from base to tip ; they are transparent, with the apex frequently black. 

 The body is dark fuscous above, and pale beneath ; every fifth ventral plate 

 on the arms is sometimes red or brown. 



Some of the varieties of this species may possibly be Ophiothrix ciliaris 

 Mul. ; the young are pale colored, and very like the adults; the plates which 

 margin the oral plates are relatively larger, being one half the size of tue latter. 



PLANARLE.

This animal has so little the appearance of a Planaria, that I long hesitated 

 to refer it to this genus ; but on careful examination, I could perceive no dis- 

 tinct character by which to separate it. The mouth is situated near the end, 

 and ou the inferior surface of the body; it is furnished on each side with a 

 small blunt retractile appendage. The ocelli are very minute, and situated 

 on each side in an oblong group, about half. a line from the extremity, the 

 abdominal ca;ca are large and blunt.

Very fiat and thin, pellucid, only rendered darker in the middle by the slight 

 color of the intestinal tubes, which are very fine and numerous, radiating 

 from a central cavity which is five times as long as wide. Ocelli five on each 

 side, closely approximated ; groups separated by a space equal to one-third 

 the distance from them to the margin or apex.

Less dilated than the last, but equally thin ; owing to the immense number 

 of small intestinal tubes the color appears uniform, the central tube extends 

 to within two lines of each extremity. There are no visible ocelli.

Remarkable for the shortness of the tentacula, which, when fully extended, 

 are scarcely longer than the diameter of their base ; they are arranged in two 

 series; those in the outer series are pale at the base. The disc is radialely 

 rugose, brilliant green, margined both internally and externally with purple. 

 The root is broad, the animals closely associated, capable of extending 1-25 

 inches. 



I have named this species as a feeble tribute of respect to the philosopher 

 to whom we owe the first rational classification of Zoophyta. 



The Committee on the following paper, by Dr. Leidy, reported in 

 favor of publication. 



On some American fresh-water Polyzoa. 

 By Joseph Leidy, .M. D. 



Since I described several species of fresh-water ciliated polyps in the last 

 number of the Proceedings, we have received the report of the British Associ- 

 ation for 1850, in which I find a very able and complete report upon " the pre- 

 sent state of our knowledge of the fresh-water Polyzoa,'' by Prof. Allman, M.D. 



Prof. Allman has very correctly applied the term Polyzoa, of Thompson, to 

 the ciliated polyps, because it had been employed prior to the application to 

 them of the term Bryozoa, of Ehrenberg. 



Prof. A. has also invented some very happy terras, applicable to different 

 parts of the structure of the Polyzoa. Thus for the common dermal system 

 and solid basis of a colony of polypes he uses the word Coencecium. The 

 external tunic of the latter he calls the Ectocyst, and that lining the tubes the 

 Endocyst, and the disk supporting the tentaculae is named the Lophophore. 



According to the characters given to the genus Cristatella, Cuv., the species 

 which 1 described in the last number of the Proceedings as C. magnifica, 

 cannot belong to that genus, as I then suspected ; for Cristatella has a " com- 

 mon flattened disk adapted for locomotion," nor can it belong to Lophopus, 

 Dumort, for although it has its base of attachment fixed, yet the ova of the 

 animal have no marginal spines, and it therefore must form a distinct genus 

 between Cristatella and Lophopus, with the following diagnosis : — 



PECTLXATELLA, Leidy. 



Coencecium massive, gelatinoid, hyaline, fixed, investing bodies, Orifices 

 arranged in irregular lobate areolje upon the free surface. Lophophore cres- 

 centic. Ova lenticular, with an annulus and marginal spines. 



1. Pectixatella magxifica, Leidy. 

 Cristatella magnifica, Leidy. Proc. A. N. S., V. 265. 



Remark. — Found only in shaded situations, always incrusting dead branches 

 of trees. 




1851.] 321 



PLUMATELLA, Lamarck. 



1. Plumatella diffusa, Leidy. Pr. A. N. S., V. 261. 



2. Plumatella nitida, Leidy. 



More robust than the preceding, color light olivaceous brown, consisting 

 usually of only a few branches ; tubes amphoraeform, without a keel, smooth 

 or transversely corrugated near the orifices which are entire. Length of the 

 articuli one line, breadth one-fourth of a line. I'olyp has the same form as 

 in the preceding, and also the same number of tentaculae. 



Habitatioji.— Found with the preceding. 



Remarks in connection with Plumatella. — Almost every stone, in many parts of 

 the Schuylkill river, particularly below the dam at Fairmount, has adhering 

 to it numerous eggs of Plumatella in short rows, which upon superficial in- 

 spection resemble prismatic crystals of some mineral. 



PALUDICELLA, Gervais. 



1. Paludicella elongata, Leidy. 



Coeneecium attached throughout, or attached by only a few articulations, the 

 remainder floating ; delicate, very much branching, colorless or ambreous, 

 shining. Articulations very long, claviform ; tubes of exit variable in length, 

 placed close to the distal extremities ; orifices entire. 



Polyps with sixteen tentaculiE arranged in the form of an inverted cone. 

 Stomach brown in color. 



Measurements. — Articuli of coenoecium to 1 line in length, by l-133d in. in 

 breadth at the dilated part, and l-285th in. at the narrow part. 



Habitation. — On the under side of stones in the Delaware and Schuylkill 

 rivers. It is found in vast profusion below the dam of the Schuylkill at 

 Philadelphia. 



Besides the foregoing, I have observed what I suspect to be the coenoecium 

 of a new genus of Polyzoa, although I have never been able to detect the 

 polyps if such exist. It resembles when viewed by the naked eye a very mi- 

 nute Isis hippuris, or the corraline Amphiroa corymbosa. Under the impres- 

 sion that it belongs to the Polyzoa, it may be characterized as follows : 



URNATELLA, Leidy. 

 Coenoecium membrano-corneous, consisting of several divergent, unbranch- 

 ing filaments, attached by a common basis. Filaments consisting of a series 

 of urn-shaped articulations, with a solid axis passing through the whole, and 

 having to each articulation one, occasionally two, tubes of exit, with the ori- 

 fices expanded, placed inferiorly near their commencement. 



Urnatella Gracilis, Leidy. 



Usually three to five filaments arising from a common basis of attachment. 

 Articulations up to nine in number to a filament, very regularly urn-form 

 except fhe distal two which are inverted pyriform, decreasing in breadth from 

 the first to the last. Body portion of each urn-form articulation yellowish 

 white, translucent, with fine transverse bands or striiE, and punctie of brown ; 

 neck or pediculate portion, columnar, transversely contorted, expanded at 

 base, black. Tubes of exit one, occasionally two, to each articulation except 

 the last, which has none, placed at the lower part of the body portion of the 




322 [November, 



articulation, and curvinfj upwards, with the orifices expanded and horizontal 

 or nearly so, amber colored with darker punctae. Interior axis white, opaque. 



ileasurements. — Length of a filament of 9 articulations 1 line; first articu- 

 lation l-140th in. in breadth, last l-220th in. 



Ilabilation. — Found growing on the under side of stones in the same situa- 

 tion as Plumatclla and Paludicella. in the river Schuylkill below the dam, at 

 Philadelphia, below low water mark. 



Remarks. — A very beautiful and graceful form, as before mentioned resem- 

 bling a miniature Isis hippuris. 



The coenoecium is hard and resistant, and has no carbonate of lime entering 

 into its composition as might probably be suspected. When compressed, the 

 axis or interior central, white, opaque column is squeezed out of the ruptured 

 articulations in the form of transparent colorless oleoid granules, from the 

 l-32,000lh to the l-4,000th of an inch in diameter. 



I have frequently found this enigmatic body, which I suspect to belong, as 

 previously stated, to a Polyzoon, but I have never been able to detect the 

 polyp. The filaments appear never to go beyond nine articulations, nor have 

 I ever found more than five filaments to a group.

The Corresponding Secret ary read a Report,- embracing the last 

 six months, which was adopted. 



Dr. Fisher offered the following, which was adopted: 



Resolved, That a Committee of three members be appointed to 

 inquire into the expediency of enlarging the Hall of the Academy, 

 so as to furnish greater accommodation for the Museum and Library, 

 and to report a plan for the same, together with an estimate of the 

 expense, and to report at the annual meeting, December 30th, next. 



Dr. J. C. Fisher, William .S. Vaux, and Dr. Bridges, were ap- 

 pointed the Committee under this resolution. 



The following resolution was also adopted : —

Professor Horner read a history of some cases of Articular In- 

 flammation of the Knee, treated successfully with Urate of Ammo- 

 nia. Referred to Dr. Leidy, Dr. Hallo well, and Dr. Rand. 



Professor Horner introduced to the Society Monseigneur Demers, 

 Bishop of Vancouver, who gave much interesting information respect- 

 ing the habits, language, and traditions of the Indian Tribes of Or- 

 egon, forty-one of which, out of seventy-one, had been visited by him. 

 He also offered the hospitalities of the Mission to which he was at- 



42 




324 [December, 



tached, to such members as mif,'ht be visiting that region, and ex- 

 pressed his wish to further the objects of the Society. 



Professor Horner exhibited some specimens of Adipocire, frag- 

 mens of human bones, and luouhl, obtained from a cemetery which 

 had been in use for upwards of a century, and from which the re- 

 mains are now being removed. One specimen of crumbling bone was 

 proved to be more than one hundred years old. 



He also read the following by Mr. John Rommel, Jr., giving 

 some particulars in relation to the subject : 



'' The cemetery from which the specimens were obtained hag been used for 

 more than a century. 



The ground for the depth of ten or twelve feet is of ordinary yellow clay, be- 

 low which it is of a gravelly nature. In the majority of places it is very hard 

 and dr3', but in some places it is quite moist, and in one or two places actually 

 swamjjy. The workmen in removing the remains, in order to save time, dig a 

 trench about eight feet wide and about twenty feet long, then the following 

 eight feet are undermined, and this is thrown into the dug trench ; hence there 

 is necessarily a great confusion as to the dates of the remains. 



But comparatively few remnants of coffins were found, but an immense num- 

 ber of bones still remained. 



In situations which were very free from moisture, no vestige of bone or cof- 

 finwasfound after a lapseof twenty to twenty-five years, and even in less time; 

 but as the ground became more moist, the preservation was more complete ; 

 and where it was swampj-, the preservation was almost perfect ; pieces of 

 shavings from the coffin (originally left there by the undertaker) being found, 

 which had been interred above forty years, and the soft parts adhering to the 

 bones, in the shape of Adipocire. I saw a corpse removed (having been interred 

 thirty-five years) which was in an almost complete state of preservation ; the 

 countenance was so perfect, that the friends of the deceased might easily have 

 recognized him ; the garments were in a good state, as was also the coffin. 



In removing the earth, the workmen would probably strike a skull ; the ground 

 being then carefully removed, the perfect skeleton was displayed, all the bones 

 being in their respective places, as if the anatomist had carefully arranged them 

 previous to making an artificial skeleton; no ligament or muscle to be seen. 



The latter were not seen in some instances in five or six years after burial. 

 Accompanying the bones, I always observed some black matter, which was 

 probably the remains of the coffin ; and where no bones at all were found, 

 about a shovel full of this black earth was seen, indicating the spot where the 

 individual had lain. 



The Bones. — There was of course every variety of sizes, and in all stages of 

 preservation ; sometimes I only saw- the shaft of the tibia, which had no other 

 mark of distinction than the spine : sometimes the femur, known only by its 

 copiparative magnitude, and by the linea aspera ; some were crumbled to 

 small pieces, and the slightest handling reduced them to powder. They were 

 nearly all brown or blackish, many looking as if they had been smoked. 




1851.] 325 



The Odor. — The odor arising fi'om the graves was not perceived unless in 

 close contact with the remains, and then it was but faint and slightly disagree- 

 able, and when the air came in contact with it, it was immediately dispelled- 

 The bones, after being removed, had an earthy odor, and not at all disagreeable. 



The Skull. — In all instances where the sutures of the skull had not been 

 completely obliterated previous to death, by old age, &c., I observed the par- 

 tial or complete separation of the bones, in many instances lying side by side, 

 completely separated, and in good condition. 



The Hair. — I had expected to find much more hair than I did ; some few 

 specimens were found well preserved ; one belonged to a young man, and was 

 as smooth, and in as fine a state, as if the hair-dresser had just left him, but 

 he had not been buried many years. In the majority of cases where it was 

 found, it was only in small quantities, and was torn with the utmost facility. 



The stature of many of the individuals was remarkable, judging from the 

 bones, many were over six feet, and many over six feet five inches in size. 

 Quite a number of iron handles (belonging to the coffins) remained, either in a 

 state of partial or complete oxidation, and remains of breast plates were also 

 found, but the engraving was totally unintelligible. 



The interring of jewelry does not appear to have been fashionable in those 

 days, or else the workmen overlooked it; only a piece of one ear-ring was 

 found, and that was as highly polished as if it had just come from the hands 

 of the jeweller. 



From the discrepancy regarding dates, these are all the facts which I have 

 been able to obtain ; but having heard from good authority that a similar 

 enterprise will be undertaken shortly, I am in hopes I shall be able to obtain 

 more facts on this interesting subject." 



Dr. Leidy exhibited a number of fossil reptilian and mammalian remains 

 which he characterized Terbally as follows : 



CiMOLiASAURUS MAGNUS, Leidy. A saurian established upon thirteen verte- 

 brae, apparently from one individual, found in the Green Sand of New Jersey, 

 and preserved in the Museum of the Academy. Two of the vertebrre are pos- 

 terior dorsal, the remainder lumbar. All of them have the processes broken 

 off, excepting one of the dorsal, which still preserves its transverse processes 

 nearly entire. 



The vertebral bodies are broader than they are long, being compressed cylin- 

 droidal in form, gradually expanding from their middle to the angular edge of 

 the articular surface. The latter are slightly concave, about one-half the 

 depth of those of Poecilopleuron Bucklandii, Dcslch., with the centre a little 

 prominent, and becoming slightly convex towards the edges. 



The transverse processes remaining in one of the specimens of dorsal vertebrae 

 are prominent, thick, irregularly cylindroid tubercles, projecting from t^e mid- 

 dle of the side of the vertebral body, with an oblique articular facet for the tib 



In the lumbar vertebra? the transverse processes incline downwards from 

 the lower part of the bodies laterally, as in Mososaurus.

DiscoSACRUS VETCSTDS, Leidy. A saurian founded upon a single vertebra 

 with the processes broken away, obtained by Mr. Joseph Jones from the cre- 

 taceous formation of Alabama. 



The body is about as large, and has a general resemblance to that of Plesi- 

 osaurus pachyomus, Owen, represented in fig. 3, tab. xx, of the Monograph on 

 the fossil reptiles of the Cretaceous Formation. It differs most remarkably 

 from the vertebral bodies of Plesiosaurus, in the articular faces forming dis- 

 tinct concave disks, separated from the bodj' by a constriction or short neck. 

 The body is relatively much broader in relation to its length than in Plesio- 

 saurus. The specimen is a cervical vertebra. Upon each side it has a deep, 

 convave, transversely oval, costal pit, with a very prominent, sharp border.

 of Nat. Hist, of New York, Vol. 3, p. 165, and represented in PI. 3, fig. 11, 

 from the Green Sand of New Jersey, and observed by that gentleman to be 

 allied to the Plesiosaurus, probably belongs to the Discosaurus vetustus. 



The vertebra described by Dr. Harlan in the Journal of this Academy, Vol. 

 4, p. 232, aud represented in pi. xiv, fig. 1, was referred to the Plesiosaurus. 

 The specimen was from the Green Sand of New Jersey, and is preserved in 

 the cabinet of the Academy. It does not belong to a saurian, but is a poste- 

 rior dorsal vertebra of a cetacean allied to ihe Delphinus. The vertebral body 

 is relatively twice the length of what it is found to be in the latter. The trans- 

 verse process is also relatively short and broad : at its extremity it has an arti- 

 cular facet for the head of a rib. 



The vertebra is probably the type of a form existing in a distinct genus of 

 ancient Cetacea, for which I propose the name Priscodelphixus. The species I

dedicate to the memory of Harlan, under the name of Priscodelphixcs Har- 

 LAM, Leidy. 



In the collection of the Academy there are preserved two caudal vertebra of 

 a young cetacean, from the Green Sand of Jersey. These specimens are larger 

 than the dorsal vertebra just described, but, from the length of their bodies, 

 and the width antero-posteriorly of the neural arch, I suspect them to belong 

 to the same genus of tue latter, but a larger species, for which I propose the 

 name Priscodelphiniis grand^vus, Leidy.

The two species of Priscodelphinus possess more than ordinary interest, 

 from their being the first mammalia which have been discovered in the creta- 

 ceous formations. 



Crocodilus fastioiatus, Leidy. Established upon a tooth which Mr. T. A. 

 Conrad informed me was obtained by Mr. Smiley from the Eocene formation 

 of Virginia. The specimen is about the size of that of Crocodilus champ- 

 soides, Owen, represented in fig. 11, tab. v, of the Monograph of the fossil Rep- 

 tilia of the London Clay by Prof. Owen. The crown has about the same 

 length as in the last mentioned species, but is more robust, more curved and 

 pointed, with more numerous ridges but not so coarse, and between the larger 

 are from one to four fine corrugated linear ridges. The fang is also a little 

 more robust. The enamel is jet black, shining. The osteo-dentine is thick, 

 dark brown with a resinous lustre.

Dr. L. further called the attention of the members to some very remarkable 

 fossil remains of mammalia from Nebraska, belonging to the collection of Dr. 

 D. D. Owen. 



The fossils consisted of a nearly entire cranium of Rhinoceros occidentalis, 

 two crania of Oreodon priscum, a large portion of the face of Archieotherium 

 Mortoni, which has true molars resembling those of Choeropotamus and Hy- 

 racotherium, and a very perfect turtle, which was characterized as follows : 



Emts Owexi, Leidy. Approaches the genus Testudo in many of its charac- 

 ters. Carapace very convex ; marginal plates nearlj- vertical ; costal plates 

 alternately broad and narrow. There are nine vertebral, nine costal, and 

 eleven marginal plates each side of the pygal and nuchal. -'

328 [December, 



The species is named in honor of Dr. D. D. Owen, of New Harmony, Indiana, 

 who has contributed this as well as iimuerous other objects to Palaeontology. 



Dr. Owen made the following observations on the locality of the 

 fossils from the " ISIauvaises Terres" of ^lissouri : 



The region of country where the remains of the fossil mammalia exhibited 

 were procured, is a part of the district known to the French Canadian voyageurs 

 of the Upper Missouri as the Mauvaises Terres or Bad Lands, which lie betwesn 

 the Missouri river and the base of the Black Hills, and the waters of the Shagea 

 and Moreaux. It presents the appearance of the great bed of some ancient lake, 

 the base of which is some three hundred feet below the general level of the wide 

 expanse of praiiie which rises in terraces towards the Rocky Mountains. 



This depressed valley of the Mauvaises Terres appears more a valley of ex- 

 cavation than of subsidence, as is proved by the multitude of isolated pinna- 

 cles, mounds, and curious outliers, which, having resisted the denuding forces, 

 stand in all imaginable fantastic shapes, memorials of the excavating forces 

 that have been at work. These rise to the height of from two to three hundred 

 feet, and form between them a complete labyrinth of intricate passages stretch- 

 ing as far as the eye can reach, that soon bewilder the incautious explorer. 



These remarkable insulated peaks, like the sides of this great valley, are com- 

 posed of horizontal beds of indurated clays, marly strata, and thin beds of quartz 

 ore conglomerates, sill probably belonging to the age of the Eocene tertiary, and 

 arethe receptacles of those unique fossil remains,presentingamost extraordinary 

 assemblage of pachyderms, some of which seem to have combined the at present 

 anomalous character of ruminants, associated with a few carniverous animals. 



The skulls, bones, and fossil fresh-water turtles are mostly found on mounds 

 of white, pale flesh-colored, and light grey and greenish marly and argilla- 

 ceous earths, the debris of denuded strata. The Palseotherium bed lies 

 towards the base of the section, from ten to twenty feet above the bottom of 

 this great valley. 



Further details concerning this curious country and its ancient fauna, to- 

 gether with a section of the strata composing it, will be found in the forth- 

 coming geological report of the North West. 



The Committee on Proceedings announced that Dr. Meigs' Memoir 

 of the late Dr. jNIorton was published, and it was now ready for distri- 

 bution. 



On motion of Dr. McEuen it was 



Resolved, That the thanks of the Society be presented to M. Des- 

 mers, Bishop of Vancouver, for his offer of the hospitalities of his 

 Mission to the members, and of his assistance in furthering the ob- 

 jects of the Society, and that a Committee be appointed for the pur- 

 pose of seconding his proposal.

 Vice President Wetherill in the Chair. 



A letter was read from Dr. D. Leasure, dated Lewistowu, Pennsyl- 

 vania, December 5th, 1851, announcing the transmission of the skin 

 of an adult American Black Bear, for the Museum. 



Dr. Le Conte presented for publication in the Journal, the con- 

 clusion of his paper entitled " An attempt to classify the Longicorn 

 Coleoptera of America North of Mexico." Referred to the Com- 

 mittee on the former portions of the paper. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper from Mr. Charles Girard, intended for 

 publication in the Proceedings, entitled " Notice of twelve new 

 genera of exotic Planarise, by Charles Girard," which was referred 

 to Mr. Lea, Dr. Ruschenberger, and Dr. Le Conte. 



Mr. Cassin read a paper, intended for publication in the Proceed- 

 ings, entitled " Description of Birds of the genera Laniarius, 

 Dicrurus, Graucalus, Pipra, and Picus, specimens of which are in 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia." Referred to a 

 Committee consisting of Dr. Fisher, Dr. Wilson, and Dr. Watson. 



Dr. Leidy exhibited several fossils, from the Green Sand of New Jersey, 

 which he characterized as follows : — 



Chelonia grand^va, Leidy. 



Proposed upon three vertebral plates from the Green Sand of New Jersey,, 

 presented to the Academy by Mr. Wetherill. 



One of these has its anterior extremity broken off, but the length of the frag- 

 ment is greater than the breadth ; its form has been quadrilateral, and it was 

 probably the first vertebral plate. Length 2 in. 8 lines ; breadth 23 lines. 



A second plate is broad hexahedral, the two lateral sides equal and shorter 

 than the anterior, which is concave, and the posterior which has the stiimp of 

 a pointed process. 



Length 26 lines ; breadth 32 lines; thickness 5^ lines. 



The third plate is hexahedral, sinuated in front, with a pointed process behind. 



Length with process 28 lines ; breadth 28 lines. 

 Tbionyx priscus, Leidy. 



Indicated by a fragment of the proximal extremity of a costal plate, from 

 the Green Sand of New Jersey. 



.Thickness of plate 3k lines, with the rib proper five lines. 



The attention of the members was also directed to a fossil cranium from 

 the Eocene of Nebraska, from the collection of Dr. D. D. Owen, which was 

 characterized as follows : — 

 Machairodus prim.evus, Leidy and Owen. 



Established upon a mutilated cranium, one-fourth less in size than the pan- 

 ther, Felis concolor. 



The greater portion of the canines is broken away, but sufficient remains 

 of that of the right side to indicate that it was long, compressed in form, and 

 denticulate upon its concave edge. 




330 [December, 



Upon the right side the second and third superior molars, and the first 

 and second inferior arc exposed to view, the others, excepting the first superior, 

 whicli has been shed, are enveloped in the matrix in which the fossil was im- 

 bedded. Upon the left side the three inferior molars are preserved nearly entire. 



The alveoli for the superior incisors remain and are very large, and leave co 

 interval between them and the canine. 



The interval between the latter and the second molar is unusiially large, 

 being 7 lines. 



The chin is broken away but ten lines anterior to the first molar, the ante- 

 rior broken margin of the jaw at its upper part is only one line thick, and 

 presents no disposition to expand for the reception of the inferior canines. 

 The coronoid process is very short, being only nine lines. The face above the 

 infra orbitar canals is very broad, and its anterior aspect with the forehead 

 form a very abrupt angle with the parietal crest, or the forehead is very high 

 above the post orbitar processes.

Dr. L. also made the cranium of a Musk-rat, obtained from a marl pit in New 

 Jersey, presented this evening by Dr. Burtt, the subject of the following re- 

 marks. He observed, the specimen served as a hint to be cautious how we 

 refer remains of animals of a recent character to older formations. There are 

 preserved in the cabinet of the Academy fragments of a lower jaw, tibia, and 

 antler of a deer, and the cranium of a beaver, which were found in digging 

 marl in New Jersey. All the specimens have the color of true marl fossils, but 

 it is evident from the character of the animals to which the remains belong, 

 that they are only accidental inhabitants of the Green Sand. They may have 

 fallen into a narrow fissure of a marl bed which was afterwards closed up, or 

 they may have sunken in marl mud on the banks of a stream, whose bed 

 afterwards may have been filled up by drift material, and thus the mode of 

 access to the marl be obliterated. In the cabinet is a specimen of the distal 

 extremity of an os femoris of a Snipe, found in the New Jersey marl, and 

 described by Dr. Harlan* as a true fossil of the latter, but this is also a frag- 

 ment of a recent animal belonging to the same category as the bones above 

 mentioned. It is doubtful whether birds appeared very anterior to the Eocene 

 period ; the ornithicnites of the new Red Sandstone may yet prove to be of 

 reptilian origin. 



Dr. Fisher remarked, in relation to the fruit of the Palm, pre- 

 sented this evening, that it was probably the fruit of the Corozo, 

 mentioned by Humboldt in his " Aspects of Nature," as being the 

 smallest of the Cocoa Palms.

Mr. Lea exhibited a specimen of Zircon imbedded in blue Quartz, 

 from the vicinity of the Yellow Springs, Chester county, Pennsylvania. 



Mr. Vaux requested the attention of the members to the beautiful 

 suit of specimens of Minerals from Nova Scotia, presented this even- 

 ing by Isaac Chipman, Esq., many of which were not in the collec- 

 tion of the Society.

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy read a paper, intended for publication in the Proceed- 

 ings, entitled " Contributions to Helminthology." Referred to Drs. 

 Hallowell, Wilson, and Zantzinger. 



Dr. Le Conte read a paper, intended for publication in the Pro- 

 ceedings, entitled " Synopsis of the Lampyrides of temperate North 

 America." Referred to Dr. Leidy, Dr. McEuen, and Mr. Lea. 



Dr. Leidy made some remarks upon the two species of Rhinoceros 

 from Nebraska, which he had named R. Nebrascensis and R. occi- 

 dentalis, and said he had satisfied himself they both belonged to the 

 subgenus Acerotherium, Kaup., a good character of distinction of 

 which, in the teeth, is the presence of a well developed basal ridge. 



Mr. Lea exhibited a complete suite of specimens of Unio multipli- 

 catus, from the Western Rivers of the United States, and made some 

 extended remarks on the Family Naiidffi.

The first division of this genus approaches very closely in form to the last, 

 and is distinguished only by the form of the last superior abdominal segment, 

 and the absence of any light giving spot. The males are distinguished by 

 the additional anal segment, which, with the preceding, is protected by the 

 large superior segment.

Northern and Southern States ; the elytra have two slightly elevated lines. 

 I have one specimen from Georgia in which there is a wide impression at the 

 middle of the thorax and the carina is wanting, it may possibly be a distinct 

 species, but is such an obscure family I am unwilling to separate it on a single

This is the common northern species, and is also found in Missouri, The 

 female only differs from the male by the last abdominal segment. Were it not 

 for the difference in sexual characters, I should not have separated this from 

 the last species, from which it can hardly be distinguished ; the fuscous spot 

 of the thorax is sometimes wanting.

This very distinct genus forms the 3d division of Laporte's genus Photinus, 

 (An. Ent. Fr. 2, 144,) and to it he has given the uncouth name of Teliphoroides ; 

 fortunately his Gallic patriotism has led him to print this as a French word, 

 so that we are enabled to replace it by the hitherto unpublished name of 

 Dejean. While on this subject I may add, that Laporte in this, as in almost 

 every other instance, has completely overlooked the real distinguishing char- 

 acters of the genus.

342 [December, 



Missouri Territorj. The thorax exactly resemljlcs that of T. lineola, but 

 the color of the mouth and feet at once distinKuishcg this species ; the elytra 

 are less coarsely scabrous thau in T. lineola. 



21. T. lineola. Cantharis lineola Fabr. Syst. El. 1, 301; Canlham

22. T. rectus Mels. Pr. Ac. Nat. Sc. 2, 305. 



Middle and Southern States. Varies, with the suture and tibia at base tes- 

 taceous ; also with the femora fuscous, tibiiv and tarsi pale. I suspect that 

 Cantharis rufipes Say. J. Ac. Nat. Sc. 3, 182, is this variety, but his descrip- 

 tion is excessively bad. 



23. T. Sayi, niger, thorace subtransverso, autrorsum subangustato, an-

One specimen, New York. Differs from T. lineola by the much narrower 

 reflexed thoracic margin, which is almost obsolete at the middle. The next 

 species has a thorax not at ail transverse, the black part is much broader, the 

 reflexed margin less narrow, and the disc is laterally excavated before the 

 middle.

Georgia, one specimen. The margin of the thorax is more distinct and 

 equally reflexed anteriorly; most nearly resembles T. rectus (Mels.,) but the 

 sides of the thorax are not straight, the sides of the disc are not excavated 

 anteriorly, and the margin is wider. 



27. T. excavatus, niger, thorace flavo quadrato, autrorsum angustato,

A very common species, which nearlj- resembles T. rectus, but the thorax is 

 more distinctly margined, the disc much more excavated, and the black part 

 is much narrower. The elytra are sometimes black, sometimes margined with 

 testaceous. This, too, may be Canth. rufipes Say.

lean find no description of this genus except in the synopsis at the end of 

 Westwood's introduction to the modern Classification of Insects, p. 27. If this 

 be the earliest publication of the characters of the genus, the name of Westwood 

 must of course be substituted in the place of Fischer, who in his Eut. Russ. only 

 mentions the genus by name, without giving any description. The species of 

 the first division all have a deep transverse impression before the middle of 

 the thorax. The second division is equivalent to Kirby's genus Malthacus.

 My specimen has the abdomen rufous, with a small fuscous spot at base. 



10. P. rugosulus Lee. Agass. Lake Superior, 229. Very common in 

 every part of the United States, and is usually mistaken for P. diadema, with 

 the description of which it does not at all agree. The thorax is narrowed in

 dato, intermedio muniti ; elytra abdomine multo breviora; caput pone oculos 

 vix angustatum. 



The form of the palpi sufficiently distinguishes this genus from the preced- 

 ing ; it approaches much closer to Telephorus. The male has a small addi- 

 tional anal segment; the female has the penultimate joint of the abdomen 

 deeply emarginate. In both sexes the superior segment is dilated, thickened 

 at the edges and emarginate at apex, so that it projects on each side of the 

 lower segment like a lateral appendage. 



Another genus with short elytra, from Panama, approaches very closely to 

 this, but the second and third joints of the antennae together are not longer 

 than the fourth : the palpi are strongly securiform, and the last joint of the 

 tarsi has no appendage between the claws.

 reported in favor of publication. 



Description of birds of the genera Laniarius, Dicrurus, Graucalus, Man- 

 acus and Picus, specimens of lohich are in the collection of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. ' 



By Jou.n Cassin. 



1. Laniariits carbonarius, nobis. 



Form. Strong and rather heavy, wings short with the fourth, fifth, sixth and 



seventh quills longest and nearly equal, tail rather short, somewhat rounded 




348 [December, 



and with all the feathers having a crimped appearance throughout their 

 length. Plumage of the rump long and silky. About the size of Dryoscoput 

 rufiventris, (Swainson.) 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of hill to end of tail about 8 J 

 inches, wiug 3^, tail 'i\ inches. 



Colors. Entire plumage above and below brownish black, palest on the 

 quills, feathers of the rump paler at their basis, bill black. 



Ilab. Western Africa, discovered by Robert MacDowell, M. D., late of 

 Sierra Leone. 



Obs. This species resembles no other with which I am acquainted. Its 

 rather short wings and tail give it more the general appearance of a Thamno- 

 philus than I have noticed in any other African species. It is peculiar, so far 

 as I know, for the uniform color of its plumage, which is (rump included) black. 



2. Dicrurus aculeatus, nobis. 



Form. Small, but rather larger than D. Ludivigii, A.. Smith. Bill rather 

 long, curved at the tip, toothed and sharply pointed ; wings with the fourth 

 quill slightly longest, but the tbird, fourth and fifth nearly equal; tail dis- 

 tinctly though not deeply forked. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 7j 

 inches, wing 4|, tail 3| inches. 



Colors. Entire plumage black with a greenish lustre, inner webs and under 

 surface of quills pale brownish, bill and feet black. 



Hab. Fazogloa, Eastern Africa. 



Obs. Resembles D. musiais, Vieill., but is smaller and has the bill longer and 

 much stronger, comparatively ; it is smaller also than D. canipennis, Swainson, 

 which it somewhat resembles in haviHg the light colored webs of the quills, but 

 can easily be distinguished by its shorter wings and tail and stronger bill. It is 

 larger than D. Ludwigii, A. Smith, and differs from all the species here men- 

 tioned in the relative lengths of the quills. Bonaparte is mistaken in making 

 D. emarginatus (Licht.) a distinct species, — it is described by Lichtenstein in 

 Verzeichniss, p. 52, and there expressly stated to be the bird figured by Le 

 Vaillant, p. 167, (which is D. musicus, Yieill.) 



3. Graucalus azureus, nobis. 



Form. Small, about the size of G. hypoleucus, Gould. Specimen now about 

 to be described not in good plumage, ends of quills and tail feathers worn, 

 wings rather long. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 7J 

 inches, wing 4\, tail about 4 inches. 



Colors. Front, extending to each eye, quills and tail black, entire plumage 

 of other partslightblue, tertiaries tipped with irregular lines of white and black. 



Hab. Western Africa, discovered by Robert MacDowell, M. D., late of 

 Sierra Leone. 



Obs. This species, which is remarkable for its color, appears to resemble the 

 bird figured in Voyage au Pole Sud (Astrolabe & Zelfee) Ois. pi. 9, fig. 3, which 

 is named in Bonaparte's Consp. Av. " Graucalus Bor/eri." It is, however, much 

 smaller. I have seen only the specimen now described. 




1851.] 349 



4. 3fanacus flaveolus, nobis. 



Form. Very similar to those of M. guiitirosus, (Desm.) and AI. Candei, 

 (Parz.) 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 3^ 

 inches, wing 2, tail about 1^ inches. 



Colors. Very similar to those of 31. ffiiilurosus, but with the parts which are 

 white in that species, pale yellow in this. Top of the head, back, wings and 

 tail, black ; throat, breast, shoulders and broad collar around the back of the 

 neck, pale yellow, running into cinereous on the abdomen. 



Ilab. Bogota, N(?w Granada. 



Obs. Two specimens of this little bird are in the collection, labelled as com- 

 ing from Bogota, and both presenting the singular variation in color, from the 

 common M. gutturosus, on the strength of which I have considered it specific- 

 ally distinct. In point of color it may be stated as intermediate between if. gut- 

 turosus and Candei. It is smaller than the latter. 



5. Picus thj/roideus, nobis. 



Form. Similar to that of P. varius, Linn., but rather larger and stouter, wings 

 with the third quill longest, legs and toes rather slender, tail rather broad. 



Dimensions. Total length of skin from tip of bill to end of tail about 8f 

 inches, wing 5^, tail 3| inches. 



Colors. — 9 Breast with a large transverse patch or belt of black ; middle of 

 the abdomen pale yellow. Head and throat brownish buflF, with obscure longi- 

 tudinal stripes of black, back, wings coverts, sides of the body beneath and 

 under tail coverts striped transversely with black and sordid yellowish white, 

 rump and upper tail coverts white, the latter with black marks on their outer 

 webs ; quills, and tail black, more or less spotted with white. 



Hab. California, discovered by Mr. John G. Bell, of New York. 



Obs. Mr. Bell's two specimens are females, and are as yet unique. This 

 species is a strict congener of Picus varius, Linn., but does not resemble it in 

 colors, nor any other species which I have met with.

In numerous individuals of what I have considered below to beof tiiree dis- 

 tinct species of the genus, they were always observed to be in a state of divi- 

 sion by pairs, and tlie primary pair of segments about their middle bad already 

 developed respiratory foveie, and were slightly indented preparatory to divi- 

 sion before the first pair were separated. 



1. MicuosTOMUM [Eustomum) Philadelphicum, Lcidy. 



Body linear, slightly attenuated posteriorly; head conoidal, with the apex 

 surmounted by a small oval papilla ; tail obtusely rounded. Respiratory fovea 

 Eub-hemispherieal, placed at the base of the cone of the head. Mouth oval, 

 protractile; oesophagus keg-shaped, intestine narrowed, cylindroid, dilated at 

 the commencement. Colorless, translucent, vibrillated ; increasing by trans- 

 verse segmentation, always observed in the process of forming two segments. 



Length 2-5ths line, by l-500th in. broad. 



Habitation. Found in the water of marshes and ditches in the neighborhood 

 of Philadelphia. 



2. MiOROSTOMUM [Eustomum) variabile, Leidy. 



Bod}' broad, linear; anteriorly and posteriorly obtusely rounded. Respiratory 

 fovea, longitudinally oval, lateral. Intestine very broad. Colorless, increasing 

 by twos. 



Length from l-80th to l-24th of an inch by l-800th to l-400th in. 

 broad. 



Habitation. With the preceding. 



3. MicROSTOMUM [Eustomum) caudatum, Leidy. 



Body long, narrow, linear ; anteriorly obtusely rounded, posteriorly ending 

 in a narrow, blunt, elevated tail l-400th in. long from the position of the anus 

 increasing by twos, the tail of the anterior segments projecting above and its 

 whole length posterior to the head of the succeeding segment. 



Length 3-4ths to l\ lines ; breadth l-300th to l-2o0th in. 



Habitation. With the preceding. 



Rhyxchodemcs sylvaticcs, Leidy : Pr. A. N. S. v, 289. Error of reference, 

 Planaria sylvatica, Leidy: ib. 241. 



Stylaria fossularis Leidy : ib. 287. A number of individuals in a state of 

 segmentation, from which the species was first described, preserved alone in a 

 glass vessel with some confervas, upon the occurrence of cold weather passed 

 into the perfect condition as follows : 



Body long, cylindroid, hyaline, permitting the ash-colored or yellowish iu- 

 testine to be seen through the integument, divided into from 50 to 65 annula- 

 tions, furnished with a distinct girdle posterior to the third annulus from the 

 mouth, which extends the breadth of three annuli. Podal hooks in fasciculi 

 of 10 to 12. Setae commencing after the girdle, usually one often two upon each 

 side of the annuli. Head obtusely rounded and prolonged into a cylindroid, 

 very moveable, digitiform, transversely wrinkled proboscis. Caudal annulus 

 terminating in two short lobes. 




1851.] 351 



Length 3-4ths to 1 inch ; breadth l-5th to l-4th of a line. Length of pro- 

 boscis l-20th inch. 



Remarks upon the habits. — When at rest the worm lies with the anterior four- 

 fifths of the body upon the surface of the mud at the bottom of the water with 

 the tail fifth buried. It is very active in its movements. It also constructs 

 tubes of mud. It is hermaphrodite, and copulater in the same manner as the 

 earth worms. 



In a number of individuals I observed bunches of spermatozoa, and in seve- 

 ral of the same from three to five nearly completely formed ova placed just 

 posterior to the girdle. 



The eggs when extruded were attached to the inside of the vessel in which 

 the worms were kept. They consisted of an oblong quadrilateral translucent, 

 whitish, papyraceous web, enclosing a light amber colored, bottle-like case, 

 with an open neck, and the body containing an opaque white globular mass ; 

 the true egg. 



The perfect worm after living about two months died. Some of the ova 

 several weeks after their extrusion were observed to have the young almost 

 perfected, and these a few days after their escape presented the following 

 characters : 



Body cylindroid, divided into 35 annulations, each with a pair of fasciculi of 

 4 or 5 hooks ; posterior to the first three also provided on each side with one 

 or two sette. Tail bilobed. Head as in the parent. No girdle; no indication of 

 division ; and no apparent developing annuli at the tail end. Length 2 lines. 



The Committee ou Dr. Le Coute's paper, concluding his descrip- 

 tions of the Longicorn Coleoptera of the United States, reported in 

 favor of publication in the Journal. 



The Committee, consisting of Dr. J. C. Fisher, Wm. S. Vaux and 

 Dr. Bridges, appointed at a late meeting "to inquire into the expedi- 

 ency of enlarging the Hall of the Academy, so as to furnish greater 

 accommodation for the Museum and Library, and to report a plan, 

 with an estimate of the expense," offered a report, which was adopted, 

 recommending the raising of the roof of the building sixteen feet 

 higher, the division of the interior of the Hall into two compartments, 

 by a floor thrown across from the second main gallery, and the 

 opening of two windows into each hall on the north and south sides. 



The entire expense of the improvement, as estimated by a contractor, 

 was $6,500, to meet with the Committee proposed that subscriptions 

 be solicited, both from members and from the citizens of Philadelphia. 

 Two resolutions appended to the report, one that it was expedient 

 to enlarge the Hall according to the plan submitted, and to appoint 

 a Committee for the purpose of obtaining subscriptions, and the 

 second giving the form of the subscription, were also adopted. Action 

 on a third resolution was postponed for the present.

[December, 



The following reports were read and adopted : 

 LIBRARIAN'S REPORT 

 For 1851. 



The rapid and steady progress which the Library has made during the past 

 few years, in the departments of Natural and Physical Science, and various 

 kindred subjects, has continued during the present year — the number of addi- 

 tions amounting to 2,262. 

 The usual table, showing the increase under each head, is herewith submitted : 



Of the whole number, 42 have been contributed by authors; by editors ; 

 77 by Societies and Corporations; 927 by Dr. Wilson ; 1,025 by Mr. Edward 

 Wilson ; 87 by other members and correspondents ; 7 by Departments of the 

 United States ; and 65 have been derived from miscellaneous sources ; — 

 total 2,262. 



In addition to these, nearly 700 volumes, periodicals, &c., and pamphlets 

 presented by Mr. Edward Wilson, are also in the Hall, but not yet recorded. 

 The entire number actually contributed this year, by this most zealous friend 

 of our Institution, will not fall far short of 1,700 of all descriptions. 



Although far distant from us, Mr Wilson has manifested the liveliest inter- 

 est in the success and advancement of the Academy, and has exerted his in- 

 dustry, and given bis time and attention in searching out rare productions for 

 its Library, to an extent which entitle him to our warmest thanks. Many of 

 these works have been drawn from sources where they were nearly lost to 

 science and the world. 



For Dr. Wilson's contributions, numerous as ever, no additional commenda- 

 tion is needed here; his eulogy is already written on all around us. 



Upou reference to the table, it will be seen that the additions to the different 

 departments of Natural History form a large proportion of the whole number. 

 Those also from authors, editors, societies, aud from our own members and cor- 

 respondents, are as numerous as usual. These latter have averaged, for succes- 




1851.] 353 



sive years, several hundred volumes, periodicals and pamphlets, and, without 

 other aid, would soon have filled our shelves. 



We most cordially invite such contributions, which are gratifying, both as 

 evincing a regard for the Institution, and as affording us opportunities for re- 

 ciprocating. From Societies abroad, however, we have yet much to ask. Al- 

 though in correspondence and exchange with many of them of the highest dis- 

 tinction, there are others which have failed to embrace the offers which we 

 have extended to them. On this account foreign Societies, previously receiving 

 our Journal and Proceedings, are now no longer on the exchange list, the only 

 return for our publications having been formal acknowledgements of their re- 

 ceipt by these Societies. The value which we may now justly claim for the 

 Journal and Proceedings of this Institution, entitles us to hope for a better 

 and more liberal feeling hereafter. 



Among the members of the Academy most conspicuous this year for contri- 

 butions to the Library, I may mention Mr. George Ord and Mr. Robert Pear- 

 sail. To Mr. Ord we are indebted for 27 folio and quarto volumes of works ; 

 and to Mr. Pearsall for eight 4to and folio volumes of valuable dictionaries in 

 foreign languages. To Mr. Haidinger, of Vienna, a correspondent of the Insti- 

 tution, we are under obligations for numerous works, of which he is either 

 author or editor. 



This constant and rapid influx of books and pamphlets has again nearly ex- 

 hausted our available room. Scarcely two years have elapsed since the adjoin- 

 ing apartment was fitted up for the reception of books, yet but little space re- 

 mains for additions, even in single volumes, and certainly none for any large 

 series. Under such circumstances, and should our present rate of increase con- 

 tinue, it will be necessary to make further provision for accommodating the 

 books. I therefore respectfully ask the early attention of the Society to this 

 important matter, merely suggesting, on this occasion, that the apartment to 

 the North of the one just referred to, and adjoining it, and now occupied as a 

 duplicate room, and used also for unpacking parcels and boxes, could be very 

 readily altered, at a moderate expense, and made to answer the required purpose. 



I would also suggest to the Society the propriety of selling the duplicate 

 volumes, now for the most part in the room last mentioned, and also the exten- 

 sive series of French Documents. This will even be necessary should the pro- 

 posed alteration be determined upon, as no space could be spared for them, 

 except in the cellar, where they would not be likely to benefit by the change. 



The proceeds of the sale of these works would, even at auction rates, form 

 a fund which could be most advantageeusly applied at present to Library pur- 

 poses. 



I also beg again to call the attention of the Society to a proposition made in 

 the last report, viz : to extend the prohibition of taking books from the Hall to 

 all the works in the Library. No reason now exists for permitting any work to 

 leave the Hall, every facility for consulting them here being afforded th^t can 

 be asked for. Although thus far we have sustained no losses, nor has any injury 

 been done, since their removal to the present apartment, yet future contingencies 

 should be guarded against, and the fact steadily kept in view, that a single care- 

 less member may occasion a loss which neither time nor money could repair. 

 The practice of loaning keys to strangers, who are usually irresponsible persons. 




354 [December, 



and admitting them to the Library at hours when the proper officers are not 

 present, is of very doubtful jiropriety, and unless checked, may sooner or 

 later cause the Society great regret. 



Respectfully submitted by 



Wm. S. Zantzinoer, 



Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS 



For 1851. 



The Museum of this Academy, placed under the charge of the Curators and 

 the Committees of the several departments, continues, up to the present time, 

 in the best state of preservation. The depredation of insects upon destructible 

 objects appears to be completely under control, through the combined influ- 

 ence of the vapor of ether and the oil of turpentine. 



The collection of Mammalia, during the past year, has been classified and 

 arranged by Drs. Bridges and Fisher. 



All departments have received valuable additions, as follows : 



Mammalia. — Of this class there have been presented 28 specimens, comprising 

 20 species, among which was a remarkably fine specimen of a Polar bear, for 

 which we are indebted to Dr. E. K. Kane, U. S. N.; also a large Rocky Moun- 

 tain sheep, presented by the Smithsonian Institution. The others are principally 

 from Dr. G. Watson, Mr. W. S. Wood, Dr. J. C. Fisher, and Mr. W. S. Vaux. 



Aves. — 42 bird skins and 17 species of eggs have been presented, chiefly by 

 Col. Geo. A. McCall, U. S. A., Messrs. Joshua Lippincolt, John Lambert, J. D. 

 Sergeant, and Dr. G. R. B. Horner. 



There were also presented 29 nests and eggs of common English birds by 

 Edward Wilson, Esq. 



Reptilia. — We are under obligation to Prof. Franklin Bache, for the original 

 collection of reptiles formerly belonging to Dr. Jacob Green, consisting of 94 

 specimens in bottles and 15 species dried Cheloniae. Besides these we have 

 received 25 species, chiefly from Dr. G. Watson and Mr. R. H. Kern. 



Pisces. — Of these 26 species have been presented, principally from Prof. F. 

 Bache. 



MoUusca. — 306 species of shells have been added to our collection, the prin- 

 cipal donors being Dr. J. L. Burtt, U. S. N., Dr. Wier Mitchell, and Dr. Thos. 

 Stewardson. 



Insecta. — Of which 200 species have been received, chiefly Coleoptera and 

 Lepidoptera. 



Crustacea. — To this department we have received the greatest accession. 

 Altogether 2,384 specimens have been presented. Of these 1,482 specimens, 

 comprising 410 species, constituted the collection of M. Guerin Meneville, pre- 

 sented to the Academy by Dr. T. B. Wilson. 



Annelida and Myriadoda. — Of which we have had presented 12 species. 



Zoophyte. — Of this class 117 specimens have been presented, chiefly by Mr. 

 Edward Wilson. 




1851.] 355 



Comparative Anatomy. — In this department there have been presented and 

 deposited 43 crania of man, and other mammalia, 2 mounted skeletons, and 7 

 miscellaneous objects. In this collection are particularly worthy of notice, a 

 very perfect skeleton of a Narwhal with a tusk 8 feet in length, and four 

 crania of the polar bear, male and female, presented by Dr. E. K. Kane. 



The other skeleton presented is a remarkably fir.e one of a dog, articulated 

 by Mr. Robert Xash, and obtained from Dr. F. W. Lewis. 



Botany. — 73 species of dried plants and fruits have been added to our col- 

 lection, of which 64 species consist of fresh-water and marine algje, presented 

 by Mr. John Hooper, of New York. 



PaUeontology . — 380 species of fossils have been received, among which are 42 

 species of minute and rare Eocene tertiary British fossils, arranged upon tab- 

 lets accompanied by magnified views, prepared by the British Natural Historj 

 Society, presented by Dr. T. B. Wilson. Also, the specimens from which were 

 described the Crocodilus antiquus Leidy, and Baljena prisca Leidy, from the 

 Miocene tertiary of Virginia, presented by Mr. Robert E. Nash ; and the origi- 

 nal specimens from which was described the Platygonus compressus Le Conte 

 presented by Dr. J. L. Le Conte. 



Mineralogy. — 238 specimens of minerals have been presented. Among these 

 was a remarkably fine large group of crystals of quartz, from Cochin China, 

 presented by Dr. J. L. Burtt, and some fine specimens of Red Chabasie( Acadia- 

 lite), Stilbite, &c., from Nova Scotia, presented by our correspondent, J. L. 

 Chipman, Esq. The remainder were obtained principally from Dr. W. L. 

 Sherman, U. S. N., and Mr. W. S. Vaux. 



As valuable additions to the Academy, for the use of its members, are two 

 excellent compound achromatic microscopes, one manufactured by Oberhaii- 

 ser, and deposited by Dr. J. K. Mitchell ; the other manufactured by Pritchard, 

 and deposited by J. P. Wetherill, Esq. 



Considering the very great value of the property of the Academy we cannot 

 take too much care in its preservation, and without having the slightest wish 

 that the access of the members themselves, to the Museum and Library, should 

 be restricted, we think it would be of advantage if all were precluded from 

 lending their keys of entrance to the building to any other than members or 

 correspondents, excepting under such circumstances as a majority of the Cura- 

 tors and Librarian may deem advisable. 



All of which is respectfully submitted by 



Joseph Leidy, 

 Chairman of Curators. 



The annual report of the Treasurer was read, and referred to the 

 Auditors. •' 



A note was read from Mr. Samuel Powel, declining a re-election 

 as Recording Secretary, in consequence of the necessity of his pro- 

 longed absence from the city. 



The following Committee was appointed to solicit subscriptions for 

 the purpose of enlarging the Hall of the Academy, under the reso- 



46

On inotron of Dr. Coates, it was 



Rcxohu'd, That members he precluded from lending their keys of 

 entrance to the buihling, to any others than members or correspond- 

 ents, excepting under such circumstances as a majority of tlie Cura- 

 tors and the Librarian may deem advisable.
