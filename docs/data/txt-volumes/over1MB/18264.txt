Description of a new Genus of the Family MELANIDiE. 

 BY ISAAC LEA. 



Genus MESESCHIZA.* 



Testa fusiformis, imperforata. Apertura rhomboidea, inferne canaliculata. 

 Labrum expansum, in medio excisum. Columella laevis, incurvata. Oper- 

 culum corneum ad spiram pertinens. 



When I described the genus Trypanostoma,f I mentioned the importance of 

 eliminating as many species as possible from the enormously-extended genus 

 Melanin. The little shell which I now propose as a new genus has so distinct 

 a character in the incision of the middle of the outer lip, as to mark perfectly 

 its place in the Melanidse of the United States. It differs entirely in the cha- 

 racter of the cut from that in Sckizostorua, which has, in all the many species 

 I have seen, a more or less deep incision immediately under the suture. The 

 living soft parts have not yet been observed. They may, when examined, 

 prove to have some characteristics quite different from Schizostoma. 



Meseschiza Grosvenorii. Testa laevi, fusiformi, tenui, obtuse conica, vel 

 ipurpureA vel vittata ; spira obtuse conica ; suturis leviter impressis ; anfracti- 

 bus instar septenis, vix convixis ; apertura, magna, rhomboidea, intus plerum- 

 que vittatd ; labro acuto, in medio leviter exciso ; columella parum iucrassata 

 et contortft.

Operculum ovate, light-brown, rather thin, having several volutions, and 

 with the polar point well removed from the left margin.

Remarks. I have thirte j n specimens of this remarkable shell. Eight of them 

 have a well-defined though delicate notch on the edge at or near to the peri- 

 phery of the last whorl. Five of the specimens hava no notch, which pro- 

 bably arises in four of them from not being full grown, and in one from having 

 the thin, delicate edge broken off. In all the specimens there is a light line 

 under the sutures, and some have six or seven brown bands, which are dis- 

 tinctly seen on the inside. The channel at the base is small but well defined. 

 In outline, this species reminds oae of GoniobasU Vauxiana (nobis) and Mela- 

 nin (Goniobasis) germana, Anth. It is a thinner shell than either, and the notch 

 in the lip removes it from that genus. The aperture is about one-half the 

 length of the shell. I have great pleasure in uaming this species after Mr. 

 Grosvenor, to whom I am greatly indebted for miny of our Western Mollusca.

Remarks. This is the fourth species of a natural group which I have de- 

 scribed, and which have a large ear-shaped aperture, viz.: Melania [Gonio- 

 basis) basalis, Midas, gibberosa and now umbonata. If they be not entitled to a 

 generic place, they may at least be considered a subgenus, for which I propose 

 the name of Eurycxlon, from Kugoc, amplus, and Kctxcv, cavilas, the aperture 

 being larger than in the Melanidse generally. All the species of Eurycie- 

 lon have a callus on the columella above, but not below, as in Lithasia, and 

 the base is more or less angular, which is not the case with Anculosa. Those 

 which we have considered as varieties of Anculosa preerosa, Say, which have 

 an angular base, properly belong, I think, to Eurycxlon as well also Anthonyi, 

 Redfield, turbinata, and tintinnabulum (nobis), and some others. When the 



* In my paper on New Melanidse. of the United States, published in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy, in 1S61, and more at large in the Journal, vol. v. and in my Observations, vol. ix. I 

 used the names of blanda and Vanuxe.mii for two new Goniobasi. Haviug used both names 

 before as Metanise, which now come under the genus Goniobasis, I propose to change blanda into 

 versa and Vanuxemii into Presloniana, the former, Vanuxemii, having been found at Col. Pres- 

 ton's salt works in Western Virginia. 



Mr. Raeve having published in his "Conchologia Iconica" Melania (Goniobasis) Canbyi (nobis) 

 under the name of ' Etowaliensis, Lea." prior to my publication of it. the name of Etowahensit 

 must be retained for that species. I therefore transfer the name of Canbyi to the speeits which 

 i subsequently published as Etowahensis in the Jour. Acad. Nat. Sfci., vol. v. and" Observations "

 think, be found to differ from Goniobasis, Trypanosoma and Lithasia, to which 

 genera they seem nearest allied. The operculum of the only one I have seen, 

 ffibberosa, is the same as Goniobasis and the Melanidse generally.

Description of and Bemarks on PLANORBIS NEWBERRYI.

 fractibus quiuis, superne planulatis ; apertura magna, pallido-cornea, sub-

 Diam. *55, Length -42 of an inch. 



Remarks. This is a very remarkable shell, and I have placed it among the 

 Planorbes until the soft parts may be observed in a living state ; they may be 

 found to differ from the true Planorbes* Some specimens preserved in alco- 

 hol have been carefully examined, but the parts are so rigid that it could not 

 be satisfactorily done. The tentacula do not, however, seem to be so long as 

 is usual in the Planorbes. The epidermis is very thin on the upper part of the 

 whorls, and the striae there are backwards in curves, and on the lower part 

 slightly forwards. The upper carina forms an acute angle, the edge being 

 cord like ; the lower one is still more acute. In most of the specimens there 

 are two obscure carinations on the whorls between the acute ones. The um- 

 bilical region is very remarkable, the perforation extending to the apex of the 

 slightly elevated spire, the apex itself being frequently wanting, owing to 

 corrosion occasioned by the attacks of some small enemy eating into the sub- 

 stance of the hard part. The upper angle of the whorls is elevated slightly 

 above the plane of the whorls, thus forming a Babylonic appearance. This 

 gives the shell the appearance of some forms of the Trochi. 



This very curious and interesting species is among the MoHusca brought by 

 J. S. Newberry, M. D., attached to the Pacific Railroad Survey under the com- 

 mand of Lieut. R. S.Williamson, U. S. A., and I have great pleasure in dedicat- 

 ing it to Dr. Newberry, who has done so much to elucidate the Natural History 

 of California and Oregon, when on these expeditions so creditable to the 

 Government. 



* Provisionally it may be called Megasystropha, from Mtya, magnus, and 

 <rutop>i, vortex, the umbilicus being large and vortex like.

Descriptions of New Species of NORTH AMERICAN POLYDESMID.E. 

 BY DR. H. C. WOOD, JR. 

 Genus POLYDESMUS. 

 Subgenus FONTARIA. 



P. TRIMACULATDS. 



P. saturate rubro-brnnneus ; scutis postice fulvo trimaculatis, corrugatis ; 

 antennis ultirais pilosis; pedibus dilute fulvis ; appendicibus genitalibus mas- 

 culis niaximis, crassibus, ultimis obtuse rotuudatis, spina terruinali gracilliraa, 

 enormiter convoluta. 



The color of tbis species is a dark reddish brown. Each scutum has on the 

 posterior portion of its lateral lamina a bright yellow or orange spot, and a 

 blotch of the same tint on the median portion of its posterior border. Occa- 

 sionally this is so prolonged as almost to give the idea of a continuous trans- 

 verse band. The first scutum has two central markings, situated the one on 

 its anterior, and the other on its posterior border. These are so shaped and 

 joined together as to suggest the idea of an hour-glass. The anal scutum is 

 triangular and somewhat elongate. It is yellow, but has a dark spot on each 

 side, and its truncate apex is tipped with brown. The head is chestnut brown. 

 Its vertex is deeply canaliculate, and its inferior lip distinctly emarginate, and 

 fringed with hairs. The antennae are light brown, slender, and not at all cla- 

 vate. The feet are light yellow, with their distal portion somewhat pilose and 

 occasionally tipped with brown. The male genital appendages are very large 

 and robust. Their terminal spine is simple, long, slender, and irregularly bent 

 upon itself. They are also furnished with a small nearly straight spinule, 

 placed proximally as to the terminal. The female genitals are very short, 

 thick and bulbous. On one side of each there is an opening, with two pro- 

 jecting plates separated from one another by a linear orifice. I have seen a 

 male and female, which were collected by Mr. E. D. Cope in Susquehanna Co., 

 Pennsylvania. They are about two inches long. 



P. CORRUGATUS. 



P. atro-castaneus, scutis fulvo postice marginatis ; laminis lateralibus fulvis, 

 latissimis, angulis anticis rotundatis, posticis modice acutis : scuto anale tri- 

 angulare, elongato, postico fulvo, apice truncato; appendicibus genitalibus 

 masculis maxirnis, spinulo laterale robusto subbreve vix curvato armatis ; 

 spina terminale maxima, robusta, compressa, tortuosa, spinulo basale armata. 



The color of the perfect animal is a chestnut black, rarely reddish chestnut, 

 with a moderately broad margin of fulvous [in alcoholic specimens] on each 

 scutum. This band may be red during life. The scuta; beautifully po- 

 lished to the naked eye, the microscope shows to be obsoletely wrinkled. 

 Very many of these wrinkles are longitudinal. The head is of the same color 

 as the body ; medianly it is distinctly sulcate ; inferiorly it is broadly and 

 rather deeply emarginate. The scutal side plates are fulvous above and be- 

 low. Their anterior angles are rounded, their posterior more or less acute, and 

 in the hinder ones prolonged. The under surface of the body is of a light 

 yellow. The male genital appendages are very large and robust. They have 

 a short, slightly crooked spinule attached and lying close to their side. The 

 terminal spine is irregularly spiral, and has near its base a curved spinule. At 

 the point of its origin is a tuft of bristly hairs. Each female genital appen- 

 dage is chiefly composed of a short, almost globular, process, in one side of 

 which there exists a large opening. This process is scarcely at all pilose. 

 Through the side opening projects a pair of large, thick plates, fitting together 

 somewhat in the manner of bivalve shells. These nearly equal in height 

 the main process. The spine on the second joint of the feet is robust, 

 but acute. The whole animal is about one and a half inches in length.

P. BIPIDDS. 



P. rubro castaneus, segmentis et antice et postice late fulvo-marginatis, la- 

 minis lateralibus dilute fulvis ; scuto anale triangulare, apice truncato et de- 

 curvato ; appendicibus genitalibus masculis elongatis, pilosis ; spina terminale 

 gracillima, proxima cylindracea, ultima bifida et noanihil abrupte curvata, 

 spinulo basale gracillimo parvo armata. 



All of my specimens have been preserved for a length of time in alcohol, so 

 that the description of color is not as accurate as it should be. The anterior 

 aspect of the head is much lighter than the vertex, which is mediauly strongly 

 canaliculate. The antennae are dilute fulvous, are rather longer than in 

 P. virginiemis, and are distally, sparsely and shortly pilose. The spicules on 

 the distal ends of the first and second joints of the long and slender feet are 

 robust, but are often obsolete anteriorly. The terminal scutum has several 

 punctae closely resembling pores. The preanal scale is triangular; it has 

 two little elevations surmounted by a punctum. The male genital appendages 

 are elongate. Their terminal spine is very slender and cylindrical in its prox- 

 imal portion ; distally it is bifid and strongly curved. It is ornated with 

 a very slender curved basal spinule.

P. CRASSICUTIS. 



P. maximus, robustus; scutis enormiter subrude punctatis; appendicibus 

 genitalibus masculis, singula spinis quatuor armata ; duobus magnis, parvis 

 duobus. 



The color of all the specimens is light testaceous ; with, in many, a dark dor- 

 sal line. It is very possible that the alcohol, in which they have been long 

 preserved, may have destroyed the original color. The animal is very large 

 and robust, and has its outer armor and side plates very heavy. The head on 

 its upper surface has a distinct median furrow, and on its lower a broadly 

 lineal, oblique depression on each side. The inferior margin is rather broadly 

 and deeply emarginate. The lateral lamina are rather short. The female 

 genital appendages are a pair of small, pyramidal, pilose bodies, whose 

 apices are split into three or four very minute mameloid processes. The 

 male organs are large, and distally very hairy. They are each armed with 

 two large and two small spines. The longer and' more slender of the former 

 at its proximal portion is bent rather abruptly at right angles to itself, but i3 

 nearly straight afterwards. The more robust is pretty straight, save at its dis- 

 tal extremity, where it is abruptly bent at right angles to itself. It is armed 

 with several very slender spinules, and has one edge distantly and obsoletely 

 denticulate. Of the smaller spines, one is short and blunt ; the other much 

 longer, sharp, slender and falciform. The last scutum is triangular, and has 

 its apex truncate and very slightly decurvate. The preanal scale is semi- 

 orbicular. 



Length, 2 to 3 inches.

 ultima abrupte curvata, dense pilosa. 



The color is darker than in P. erythropygus. The side plates are rather

short, with their edges ranch thickened. The head has its vertex strongly 

 canaliculate. Its anterior face is marked with two small punctiform impres- 

 sions. The lower border is not very strongly emarginate, and is set with a 

 fringe of short thick hairs. The antennae are mostly dark colored, scarcely at 

 all clavate and coarsely pubescent. The feet are rough, with closely set, stiff 

 hairs. The anal scutum is prolonged posteriorly, so as to come almost to a 

 blunt point. The genital appendages in the male are short and thick. Their 

 terminal spine is slightly curved at its base, thence is nearly straight, save at its 

 distal extremity, where it is abruptly curved, becoming nearly horizontal. It is 

 beset with very numerous long hairs. We have examined them in eighteen spe- 

 cimens, and found them to agree perfectly. The female genital appendages 

 consist of a pair of short, conoidal, very pilose processes, which have an opening 

 along their inner edge. 



Length one inch and an eighth.

This is possibly a distinct species, but as I have seen but a very few indivi- 

 duals, and the male genital appendages do not differ from those of P. hispidipes, 

 I prefer not risking a synonym. Whether the spots are yellowish or red in 

 the living animal, the length of time our individuals have been preserved in 

 alcohol precludes me from deciding. 



The spots are sometimes arranged regularly two large ones on each side ot 

 the mesial line, and a row of small ones on the posterior border.

The head has the median furrow on its vertex illy pronounced. The ante- 

 rior face is sparsely pilose, and has its lower margin broadly but shallowly 

 emarginate. The scuta have a double row of scales, obsolete but otherwise 

 similar to those of the following species. Sometimes these are entirely lost. 

 The lateral margins of the side plates are rounded slightly and minutely serru- 

 late. They seldom have more than three serratures on each side. The ter- 

 minal scutum is triangular, with its obtuse apex bent downwards. It is 

 sparsely pilose. The legs are quite hairy, and light colored. Their second 

 joint is tumid. The genital appendages in the male are peculiar. The termi- 

 nal spines are broad and short, and superiorly very obliquely truncated, with 

 two small hamular processes. On each side a long, seta-like process springs 

 from the base. The outer, much the longer of the two, throws an arch entire- 

 ly over the short spines. The inner is straighter. They both have one or two 

 thorn-like excrescences.

Judging from our badly preserved alcoholic specimens, the color of this spe- 

 cies is reddish brown, with the side plates a lighter color. The body is very 

 robust The head has a median furrow on its vertex, and its lower border 

 emarginate. The side plates have but the posterior angles, which are acute.

The scuta appear to have a narrow edging of black posteriorly. The terminal 

 scutum is subtriangular, very prolonged and very thick posteriorly. We have 

 never had an opportunity of examining the male genital organs. Ihose of the 

 female are very pilose, and are formed of two portions. They are contracted 

 at their bases, and expanded above, somewhat as a reversed flattened cone. 

 The basal piece is thicker, and less hairy than the other. The distal piece is 

 set into it, and has along the free extremity an opeuing.

The head is dark colored. Besides its median furrow, it is also ornamented 

 with a pair of sometimes illy pronounced punctae on each side of the ver- 

 tex. Its inferior border is rather broadly emarginate. The antennae are 

 elongate, dark brown, and tipped with black. The anal scutum agrees with 

 the others in color. It is triangular, with its apex truncate, obscurely emar- 

 ginate and decurvate. The male genital appendages are strikingly elongate. 

 The terminal spine is nearly black. It is bent spirafly on itself, but after per- 

 forming a little more than an entire turn is nearly horizontal for some length. 

 It is flattened, with its superior surface somewhat umbonate. It ends in a 

 thick, blunt, spine-like process. The proximal portion of the anterior margin 

 is acutely serrate. From the edge projects a short thorn-like spinule, and 

 from the base a long, slender falciform spine.

The head is lighter colored than the body. It is medianly canaliculate, 

 with a pair of punctations on each side of its vertex. Its inferior border is 

 broadly emarginate. The antennae are rather long and slender, very slightly 

 clavate, light brown, and distally tipped with black. The scuta are smooth, 

 beautifully polished, and not corrugate. The side plates are distant, quite 

 small, and nearly horizontal. Their anterior angles are rounded. The anal 

 scutum is prolonged, and is sometimes wholly, sometimes partially orange. It 

 is triangular, with its apex truncate and slightly emarginate, and its sides 

 curved. It projects posteriorly, and is bent downwards. The feet are cylin- 

 drical, yellow, and somewhat pilose. The male genital appendages resemble 

 those of P. placidus, except in color. They are yellowish. Those of the female 

 consist of a pair of short, blunt processes. Each of these has a basal portion into 

 which is set a short somewhat flattened body, with an obscure linear opening 

 traversing its distai surface. From the junction of these two parts springs a 

 heavy fringe of long, coarse hair. P. floridus is very possibly a distinct spe- 

 cies from F. placidus. I have seen but a single individual of the latter. The 

 general appearance of the two is so dissimilar, as to incline me to the be- 

 lief of their distinctness. But they agree well as to their genitalia, and a suite 

 of specimens might show their identity.

Judging from an alcholic specimen, the color of this animal is an olive chest- 

 nut, with the fide plates yellowish, and the posterior portions of the scuta 

 much lighter than the anterior. The head is bright chestnut, and is orna- 

 mented with a median furrow on its vertex, and a pair of impressed dots on each 

 side of its face. Its inferior border is medianly moderately emarginate. The 

 margins of the side plates are somewhat thickened. The anal scutum is yel- 

 lowish, small, subtriangular, and distinctly emarginate posteriorly. The feet 

 are very slender, and are shortly pilose. The femora of the hinder ones are 

 armed with a small spine on their distal extremity. The male genital append- 

 ages are small, and are hairy at the base. They are armed with a broad, ob- 

 tuse, spinous process, and a slender curved spine besides the terminal. The 

 latter is robust, and is bent with a double curve, that is anteriorly and lateral- 

 ly. I have dedicated this species to my friend, Dr. Hayden, whose name is 

 inseparably connected with the far West.

Descriptions of New Species of North American ITJLID2E. 



BY DR. H. C. WOOD, JR. 



Genus IULUS. 



I. VENUSTUS. 



I. rubro-castaneus, linea dorsale nigra et maculae nigra? seriebus lateralibus 

 (interdum obsoletis) ornatus ; antennis longis, filiformibus, pilosis, baud cla- 

 vatis ; scutorum lateribus canalicnlatis ; segmentis 52 ; mucrone parvo. 



The general color of this species is reddish chestnut ; frequently the red 

 predominates so much that the individual is rea^y flesh-colored, but occa- 

 sionally the chestnut overcomes the other tint. The dorsal stripe is generally 

 very distinct, especially on the posterior portion of the scuta. The eyes are 

 triangular, and are connected by a dark band, which is often rather obscure. 

 The anterior cephalic aspect is long and narrow, with its sides converging in- 

 feriorly. Its inferior border is fringed with a double row of short, distant 

 hairs, and is medianly deeply emarginate and 2 4 dentate. The scuta are 

 ornamented, rarely with a white blotch on each side of the mesial line, but 

 generally with two lateral black dots. The first scutum in the female has the 

 anterior margin oblique as to the main axis of the body, and is prolonged 

 laterally so as to form processes, mostly canaliculate, with a rounded border. 

 In the male the anterior margin is at right angles to the axis of the body, and 

 the lateral parallel to it, so that there are no processes. The male genital 

 appendages consist of two main portions on each side. The outer and more 

 conspicuous of these is formed of a thin, very irregular plate, from whose 

 base springs a short, clavate, cylindrical, distally pilose process. The inner 

 portion is composed of a long, very slender, almost setiform process, and a 

 shorter straighter one. The former at its base is bent at right angles to itself ; 

 and distally it is somewhat spirally arched over the other. 



The female genital appendages consist of two broad, robust, pilose processes, 

 with a pair of very slender, almost filiform, feet like bodies, springing from 

 their conjunction and equalling them in length. The major portion of each 

 appendage is composed of a single plate. This is folded on itself, so as to 

 constitute an irregular, flattened cylinder, which is open at its end, and along 



[Jan.

the outer edge. It presents on one aspect an unbroken, tolerably regular 

 surface, but on the other is proximally abbreviated. Through the opening 

 thus afforded projects a pair of subcircular, somewhat globose plates, fitting 

 together much as the shells of a bivalve. 



Length, 2 inches. 



Hab. Illinois. Smithsonian Institution. R. Kennicott. 



In the same collection we have seen a male lulus very closely resembling 

 the former, but differing so much in its genital appendages, that it probably 

 represents a distinct species. The outer of the two parts, forming each geni- 

 tal appendages, consists of a thin, flat, crooked, very irregular process, and 

 a shorter, robust, pilose and strongly clavate one. The former, proximally, 

 is quite broad, and narrows from the base, but distally is but at a right 

 angle to itself, and is rapidly contracted, so as to terminate in a nearly cylin- 

 drical crooked point. The main process of the inner portion is somewhat 

 cylindrical proximally, but is distally expanded. At first bent at a right 

 angle to itself, it next has the swan-neck curve, and is then bent at an acute 

 angle to itself to be straight the remainder of its length. At this augle there 

 is a minute sharp spine. Shielded, as it were, by this process, there is 

 another, very slender and acute.

The color of this species is a chestnut brown, sometimes mottled with 

 light brown. The anterior aspect is beautifully but irregularly areolated 

 with the latter color. The antennae are moderately long, and have their dark 

 joints tipped with white. Their is a pair of coarse punctations on the vertex. 

 Each scutum has a series of distinct punctations extending entirely around 

 it ; from these dots proceed little channels, obsolete on the fore-part of the 

 body, but gradually becoming strongly pronounced. The anterior portion of 

 the body is sparsely, but tli^ posterior densely, pilose. The anal scales are 

 very rough. We have never seen a male. Neither can we give a detailed 

 account of the female genital appendages, but one portion of them consists of 

 a pair of short, subcylindrical, rather robust and distally clavate processes.

 preanali triangulare. 



The color of this elegant species is a bright chestnut, ornamented with. 

 rings of a very light brown and a dorsal black line, as well as a black spot 

 on the side of each scutum. In some individuals there is on the anterior por- 

 tion of the first scutum, a black crescentic blotch, and on the posterior a 

 border of the same tint. The anterior aspect of the vertex is long and nar- 

 row and deeply emarginate interiorly, where it is denticulate and fringed 

 with two rows of distant hairs. The eyes are somewhat elliptical, and 

 are connected by an illy defined black band. The posterior portion of the 

 body is not pubescent. The outer piece of the male genital appendages is 

 rather long, straight and somewhat clavate, and distally pilose. The inner 

 process is large, and is formed of a plate so folded longitudinally as to form a 

 groove on the inner edge. From the base of the genital appendage springs 



[Jan. 




12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



a slender process, which soon bifurcates ; the more slender of the division is 

 the longer. They both soon enter the groove, before spoken of, the shorter 

 and more robust being distal as to the other, and emerging from the groove 

 on the other side of the main process, whilst the longer comes out on the side 

 it enters. The female genital appendages are composed of a broad, thin 

 piece, from which arises a pair of filiform, feet-like processes, besides two 

 other very robust ones. These last are sparsely pilose, and about as long as 

 broad. They reach about to the base of the filiform bodies, and have a slit- 

 like orifice in their summit.

 busto, acuto. 



The color of all our specimens is a very dark reddish brown, unrelieved by 

 any other tint. On the vertex is a pair of coarse punctations, as in /. Cana- 

 densis. The lateral processes of the first scutum in the female, although 

 small, are somewhat canaliculate. The mucro is certainly smaller than that 

 oil. Canadensis. The male genital appendages are composed of two part?. 

 The outer of these consists of a somewhat clavate and pilose process, with 

 a curiously folded and contorted plate on its inner side. The other portion is 

 formed of a straight process, which has several minute, spine-like bodies on 

 its free extremity, and is proximally suddenly contracted, and then expand 

 somewhat, so as to give an appearance of emargination. From the base of 

 this springs another, almost filamentous process. 



The female genital appendages consist of two bodies conjoined at their 

 bases, and blunt at their free extremity. When viewed from one aspect, 

 they appear cylindrical, but from the other, flattened or even concave ; oppo- 

 site to the latter face there is a broad, irregular piece, which has its free extre- 

 mity scolloped.

The color of this species is a dark brown, with sometimes a bluish tint, and 

 very gradually mottled with light brown. The triangular eyes are connected 

 by an obscure black band. The labial margin is broadly emargiuate, and is 

 furnished with two or three denticules, as well as a double row of distant 

 rigid hairs. The joints of the antennae are tipped with white. The first scu- 

 tum is, in the female, slightly prolonged laterally, where it is rounded off; on 

 its anterior surface there is a dark somewhat crescentic blotch. The anterior 

 of the two subscuta, forming each scutum, is closely and deeply canaliculate 

 through its whole circumference ; it is broader than the posterior, and very 

 slightly elevated, so as to give the body somewhat of a moniliform appear- 

 ance. The ring of hairs surrounding each scutum is frequently imperfect ; it 

 may be from the handling of the specimen. The posterior subscutum is 

 smooth above, and distantly and shallowly canaliculate below. The posteri- 

 or portion of the body is very pilose. I have never seen a male.

The color of this species is brown, sometimes bluish, mottled, almost areo- 

 lated, with light brown. The eyes are triangular, and are united by a dark 

 band. The head has its anterior margin broadly emarginate, denticulate and 

 furnished with two rows of distant rigid hairs. The antennae have their prox- 

 imal joints nearly cylindrical, and are light colored, with their articles indis- 

 tinctly tipped with white. The first scutum has rather small lateral processes, 

 and is ornamented on its anterior border with a dark band. The anterior 

 subscutum is deeply and closely canaliculate over the whole of its surface. 

 The anal scales are furnished with a series of long hairs along their valvular 

 margin. The posterior portion is generally adorned with a very few scattered 

 hairs, hut I have never seen it pilose. 



Length, three-quarters of an inch. 



This species differs from /. canaliculatus in its smaller size the absence of 

 hairs on the anterior, and their paucity on the posterior portion of the body, 

 and in the mucro being larger in proportion to the rest of the animal. Yet 

 they may possibly prove to be the young of that species.

The color of this species is a very dark, almost black brown ; but the ante- 

 rior portion of the body, and especially the head, is lighter. The antennae 

 are very pilose, and quite strongly clavate. The eyes are connected together 

 by a black band. The anterior scuta have their lateral surfaces closely and 

 deeply canaliculate, but are almost smooth on their ucper surface. The pos- 

 terior are everywhere deeply channeled, although more so below than above. 

 There are a few hairs on the anal scales. The anal scutum is not mucro- 

 nate. It affords me pleasure to dedicate this species to Prof. Miles, who is 

 laboring so assiduously and successfully to develop the zoology of Michigan.

The color of this species is dark brown. The anterior surface of the head 

 is an obscure gray color, with a dark band inferiorly. There is between the 

 upper and anterior surface of the head a well marked angle, almost an ele- 

 vated ridge. The lower margin is fringed with a few hairs, and is emarginate 

 and armed with a few denticules. The triangular eyes are connected by a 

 distinct, impressed line. On the upper portion of the anterior surface of the 

 head are two round, light dots surrounded by a darker tint. The antennae 

 are wanting in the only specimen, a female, that I have seen, which is so 

 mutilated that I cannot say certainly of how many segments it was composed ; 

 the number, however, was probably either 34 or 45. The first scutum has 

 very small, lateral processes. It is light brown, bordered with a dark band, 

 edged with a grayish tint. The anterior portion of the body is of a lighter 

 shade than the posterior, and has the grayish annuli more distinctly pro- 

 nounced. The anal scutum is not raucronate. The anal 9cales are not pilose

I. CSRUIiEO-CINCTUS. 



I. brunneus, saturate caeruleo annul atus ; segmentis 42 ; antennis parvis ; 

 scutis infra et supra modice canaliculatis ; mucrone nullo. 



The color of this species is brown, with a dark, sometimes obsolete ring of 

 blue to each segment, except the most anterior. The lower portion of the 

 anterior surface of the head is light brown. The labial margin is scarcely 

 eniargmate, but is rounded and fringed with rigid hairs. The eyes are ar- 

 ranged in subtriangular patches, with their transverse diameter much the 

 greater. They are connected by a black band, which is much broader in the 

 middle than at the ends. The first scutum is large, with very small lateral 

 processes even iu the female. There is on its anterior edge a very obscure 

 light border, and a little posterior to this a black, more or less obsolete, band. 

 The scuta are regularly, although rather lightly and distantly canaliculate 

 over their whole surface. The last scutum is distinctly but minutely punc- 

 tate, has its edge whitish, and is not at all mucronate. The anal scales are 

 not at all pilose. The specimens from which this description are taken are in 

 so bad a condition that I have hesitated to notice them. But probably the 

 description will be found to be sufficiently accurate for the identification of 

 the species.

The general color of this species is rather dark brown in the adult. But 

 when an individual is examined with a magnifier, it is seen to be beautifully 

 areolated with light brown. In young specimens and adults, which have re- 

 cently shed their exuviae, the color often verges on white, whilst the side 

 spots are black, contrasting strongly with the general tint. The head is 

 rather broad inferiorly, and has its lower margin shallowly emarginate, and 

 distinctly though minutely denticulate. The triangular eyes are connected 

 by a broad, dark band. The first scutum is ornamented on its anterior por- 

 tion by a dark, transverse band. The lateral processes are almost wanting, 

 even in the female. There is on each side a series of large, black dots, one 

 to a scutum, commencing rather abruptly at about the 5th or 6th segment, 

 and ending in the same way at about the 39th. The subscutum on which 

 they are situated are scarcely canaliculate. The anal scutum is about equal 

 in length to the two preceding it.

The sides of the body are deep brown, almost black, whilst the dorsum ap- 

 proaches a yellowish fawn color, and has a strongly pronounced, black, me- 

 dian line. The lower margin of the head is broadly emarginate, denticulate, 

 and fringed with a series of hairs. The anterior surface is mottled with light 

 brown, and has a dark median band, terminating in a transverse one low 

 down. The under surface of the body is light-colored, and is often somewhat 

 areolated. There are some specimens whose pattern of coloration is light 

 brown or fawn colored, with two lateral and one median dark stripe. Are 

 these, individuals which have recently cast off their exuviae ? The eye-patches

The color of this species is fulvous, often varying towards orange. On 

 each scutum there is a large dark-green transverse crescentic blotch. This 

 is often so wide superiorly as to involve the whole of the dorsum. In some 

 individuals there are lateral series of white blotches, and occasionally a 

 black line on each side. These are, however, not common. The head 

 has a strongly pronounced median furrow, and is greenish superiorly. The 

 eye spots are somewhat orbicular, with occasionally a tendency to become 

 tetra- or polygonal. The antennae are longer than in S. marginatus. The 

 scuta are not rough, and are very lightly or even obsoletely furrowed be- 

 neath. The spines on the inferior surface of legs are very numerous and 

 acute. The male genital appendages are formed of two main portions joined 

 together, as in 5. marginatus. The large plate of the main process is broad. 

 The upper border of its face has a wavy outline. Externally it is produeed 

 into an alar portion, which ends in a blunt process at right angles to it. The 

 inner piece is composed of a basilar and superior joint. The basilar is very 

 long. The other is curved, and presents on one aspect a strongly convex, on 

 the other a strongly concave surface. It ends in a blunt point, and is armed 

 with a large blunt process and an acute spine. The female genital append- 

 ages appear to consist on each side of a process deeply placed within 

 the body this is thin on its free margin, which is rounded, though some- 

 what acuminate below it is contracted and thickened. The three pairs of 

 feet immediately in front of the genital aperture in the male have their 

 coxae produced into long processes. These are often of a curious form, but 

 do not seem constant in this. The fourth and even fifth coxae have small 

 processes.

The color of this species is a bright brown, with an annulus of dark red- 

 dish brown on the posterior border of each segment. The head is distinctly 

 medianly caualiculate, except in the centre, and has the row of dots on its 

 anterior face as in S. marginutus, but is not as decidedly punctate elsewhere 

 as in that species. The eyes are triangular. The antenna? closely resemble 

 those of S. marginatus, but are, perhaps, rather shorter and more compressed. 

 The first scutum is banded, both anteriorly and posteriorly. The lateral pro- 

 cesses, even the female, are almost wanting. The second scutum is produced 

 forwards as in S. marginatus. The male genital appendages are composed of 

 a yoke-like piece and two outer parts, which it connects. The central piece 

 may be described as formed by two plates (although but really one) meeting at

an angle in the centre and attached to the outer parts at their other extremi- 

 ties. These outer articles are formed each as follows : First, There is a 

 large plate which is bent around an inner basal piece, and is deeply notched 

 laterally, but is produced anteriorly into a broad almost rudely punctate plate, 

 and posteriorly into a short, slender process, terminating in an imperfect 

 hook. This last process is sometimes obsolete. Second, Articulating with 

 the inner basal piece, alluded to, there exists a large, strongly-curved, acute 

 hook or claw, whose distal extremity is subcylindrical. The female genital 

 appendages are small, and are composed on each side of a very thin plate and 

 a process about a line in length, irregularly prismatic in shape proximally ; 

 but distally excavated suddenly, so as to be flattened for the remainder of 

 its course.

The color of this species is black, with a brown band on the sides, in 

 which is a black dot marking the position of the lateral pores. The lower 

 portion of the head is very light-brown, and has its margin rather deeply 

 emarginate. Along the posterior cephalic border is a somewhat crescentic area, 

 which is nearly smooth and is medianly canaliculate, adjoining this the surface 

 suddenly is rudely punctate, but gradually becomes smoother. The eyes are 

 arranged in three transverse rows, the posterior being much the longer. The 

 first scutum is copiously coarsely punctate, and is posteriorly slightly cana- 

 liculate on the dorsum, but distinctly so on the sides. The lateral processes, 

 even in the female, are very small, the second scutum being produced for- 

 wards so as to abut on the head. The posterior subscuta are on the dorsum 

 closely, rather deeply, and more or less obliquely canaliculate, but on the sides 

 less distinctly and more distantly so. The anterior subscuta are very distantly 

 and much more lightly and obliquely canaliculate, and are also more closely 

 channeled below than above. The surface of the anal scutum is irregularly 

 and minutely corrugate. We have seen but one specimen, a female. The 

 female genital appendages appear to consist of two conoidal bodies coalescing 

 at their bases and united together towards their apices by a broad plate, so 

 placed as to present towards them an inclined surface. Into the base of these 

 pyramidal processes fit other somewhat prismatic bodies, with their thin edge 

 formed of several pieces.

Notes of Botanical Visits to the Lower Fart of Delaware and the Eastern 



Shore of Maryland. 



BY WM. M. CANBY. 



The peninsula lying between Delaware and Chesapeake Bays has been al- 

 most a terra incognita to botanists ; although, from its geographical position, 

 and from the varied character of the country, embracing great variety of soil, 

 salt and fresh water marshes and rivers, large swamps, and a considerable 

 extent of coast, it might well be supposed to be a fine botanical district. 



In this expectation, the writer, (sometimes accompanied by botanical 

 friends,) made.short visits to a few places in the counties of Sussex, in Delaware, 

 and Worcester and Somerset, in Maryland, during the months of September and 

 October last. Taking into account the lateness of the season and the limited 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 17 



extent of country looked over, the result, as shown in the list below, is en- 

 couraging, and leads to the belief that a more extensive exploration would 

 yield further additions to the Northern Flora. 



When our knowledge of the botany of this peninsula becomes more perfect, 

 an interesting comparison might be made of its Flora with that of the lower 

 part of Illinois ; the plants of the Southern Mississippi Valley would probably 

 be found creeping up into the latter, as those of the Southern coast, and Pine 

 Barren region, do into the former. 



Of a considerable number of rare and interesting plants collected, only those 

 not described in the " Manual " of Prof. Gray are given in the list below, 

 with some observations on rare allied species. One or two, detected in locali- 

 ties not in the district under consideration, are also given. 



Desmodium ochkoleucum, M. A. Curtis, in Herb. Gray. {Hedysarum humi- 



fusum, Ell. in Herb. Muhl. ): caule procumbente tereti hirsuto elongato ; foliolis 



ovatis aliquanto rhomboidiis reticulatis ; stipulis et bractiis ovatis acuminatis 



striatis ; tloribus ochroleucis ; lomentorum articulis, (| pollicaribus, ) 



reticulatis ssepius contortis. 



In an open woodland, one mile south of "Public Landing," (on Chingo- 

 teague Bay,) Worcester county, Maryland. Fl. Sept, 4. Fruit. Oct. 2. 



Stems many (6 to 10), 18 inches to 3 ft. long, spreading in every direction 

 from the root, and, with the petioles and pedicels, quite hirsute with spread- 

 ing hairs, as well as pubescent with shorter hooked ones. Flowers ochro- 

 leucus ! Legume (always ?) much contorted. 



There is a specimen of this plant without flowers in Muhlenberg's herba- 

 rium, sent by Elliott from South Carolina under the name of Hedysarum 

 humifusum. The fruit on this presents the same twisted appearance as in all 

 the Maryland specimens. This specimen is not in the general collection, but 

 is contained in a special collection of the genus Hedysarum, which is accom- 

 panied by a numbered list. In this, Elliott's plant is placed in a distinct 

 paper, and far separated from Muhlenberg's humifusum ; the former being No. 



19, the latter (in full), "No. 43 humifusum, Aug. 25, 27, 12" (the 



latter number probably intended for the year 1812). Thus it would appear, 

 that Muhlenberg, at the time of making up this monographic collection, con- 

 sidered them distinct, as they certainly are. But afterwards, in his descrip- 

 tion in the MSS., Plant. Amer. Sept., and in the printed work, he con- 

 founds them, and in the latter the locality of Hedysarum humifusum is given, 

 "Mass. to Penna. and Carolina." The last is to be excluded, as the species 

 has been found only near* Waltham, Mass. (Bigelow) and Lancaster, Penna. 



Hydrocotyle vulgaris, L. ? In a swamp one mile east of Snow Hill, Mary- 

 land. Umbels, or rather verticils, two to five. Sept. to Oct. 



Hydrocotyle repanda, Pers. A glabrate form, found in meadows border- 

 ing Chingoteague Bay, Worcester county, Maryland. Oct. 



* The Mass. locality is now supposed to be destroyed. In Muhlenberg's MSS. in the library 

 of the Academy, he gives the date of collection and locality of his plant, viz., " Aug. 28, 12, 

 (1812), upon Montgomery Island." This may be in the River Susquehanna. The attention of 

 botanists in the neighborhood is requested to this point. The plant may yet be identified and 

 specimens furnished from the original locality. The descriptions in Torrey and Gray, Gray's 

 Manual, Ac, appear to be sufficient, except that the character, stem angled or striated, should 

 be added to distinguish it from the round stem of D. ochroleucum. 



The three allied species may be thus compared: 



D. rotumdifolicm. Stem hirsute and augled ; leaflets orbicular; bracts and stipules broadly 

 ovate ; flowers purple ; joints of the legume large. 



D. humifusum. Stem angled, nearly smooth ; loaflets ovate ; stipules and braots lanceolate ; 

 flowers purple ; joints of the legume small. 



D. ocnioLEUouM Stani terete, hirsute; leaflets ovate reticulated ; stipules aud bracts ovate acu 

 minate; flowers ochroleucus ; joints of the twisted pod large.

 plant, consisting of small branches with leaves only, exist in the herbarium 

 of Muhlenberg. In the Academy's herbarium there are specimens, collected 

 by Dr. Pickering, with leaves and fruit. By last season's collections, the 

 anomaly of a fall-flowering alder is brought to light. So singular a departure 

 from the habit of the genus may well excite a doubt as to whether it is not 

 a mere sport, or the precocious blooming of an ordinarily spring-flowering 

 plant. Yet the observations made seem to preclude this idea. The plant 

 was noticed at several stations over a range of fifty miles, and in the begin- 

 ning of September was every where found in blossom. In going over much 

 the same ground about the middle of the month, the sterile catkins had all 

 fallen or withered ; and when again observed in the beginning of October, no 

 preparation for spring flowering could be seen, although on A. serrulata the 

 young catkins were already an inch long. Next season's observations will 

 probably decide the question. This shrub, or small tree, attains the height 

 of 16 to 18 feet, growing much like A. serrulata, but with a moie open habit, 

 and with the bark lighter colored. The leaves are smooth and glossy, on 

 longish petioles, not furrowed above, thick, and strongly veined beneath. 

 Sterile catkins resembling those of A. incana, but the scales more glutinous. 

 The glossy foliage and handsome sterile catkins (should they prove to be 

 regularly produced in the fall), would make this a desirable shrub in lawns,

The Crania of COLYMBUS TOBQUATTJS and C. ADAMSII compared. 

 BY ELLIOTT COUES, M. D. 



I have already, in a previous paper,* presented the external characters of 

 size, form, and color by which the C. Adamsii may be distinguished from the 

 common C. torquatus. To more completely substantiate the claims of the 

 former to specific distinction, which I understand is denied it by some orni- 

 thologists, I have taken advantage of an opportunity of comparing the crania 

 of the two species, to present the marked points of difference, as regards size 

 and shape, which an examination of the skulls shows to exist. It is per- 

 fectly easy to diagnose either species from the characters of their crania alone. 



As might be expected from the relative dimensions of the two birds, the 

 cranium of C. Adamsii is considerably larger than that of C. torquatus. The 

 difference is particularly striking in the length of the skull, taken as a 

 whole, as well as in the longitudinal dimensions of its individual elements. 

 The total length exceeds that of C. torquatus by fully an inch ; and the dif- 

 ference in the length of particular bones, as the intermaxillary, palatals, malars, 

 vomer, etc., is proportionately as much. In connection with this increase in 

 the length of skull, there is to be taken into consideration another point, 

 which confers upon the cranium of C. Adamsii a marked difference in general 

 contour, viz., its remarkable narroioness. In width at the several points, 

 the cranium by no means preponderates over that of C. torquatus in propor- 

 tion to its marked difference in length. Thus, is diameter across the fronto- 

 maxillary suture, or across the anterior or posterior orbital process, is, both 

 absolutely and relatively, but little greater than that of C. torquatus, while 

 across the mastoid processes the width is absolutely the same, and therefore 

 relatively less in C. Adamsii. 



The external character, which is perhaps the most distinctive feature of C. 

 Adamsii viz., the size and shape of the bill, corresponds, of course, to a like 

 modification of the proportions of the intermaxillary and inferior maxillary 

 bones. In fact, the difference in the relative proportions of the crania of the

two birds is produced, in great measure, by the greater developement and 

 somewbat different shape of these two bones. The discrepancies in length 

 Lave already been adverted to. Those of sbape consist chiefly in the greater 

 elevation of the apices of the inter- and infero-maxillary bones. The line 

 formed by the mandibular ramus of the intermaxillary and the malar bone, 

 is in torquatus a gentle curve, the concavity of which looks downwards ; in 

 Adamsii it is a straight, line. The commissural edge of the inferior maxillary 

 of torquatus is about straight as far as the angle of the jaw ; in Adamsii it is 

 a gentle curve, whose concavity looks upwards. The greater production of 

 the inter- and infero-maxillary bones makes their apices much more acute in 

 Adamsii than in torquatus, while, at the same time, in consequence of the 

 comparative narrowness of the skull of the former, the angle of divergence 

 of the rami of these two bones is not greater, and the bill on this account no 

 wider. The symphysis of the mandibular rami is longer in Adamsii than in 

 torquatus, and the prominence at the angle of the jaw is more marked. 



In addition to the above, it may be said, in general terms, that the various 

 ridges and depressions of the skull of Adamsii are more strongly marked 

 than those of torquatus, corresponding to the superior size and muscularity 

 of the former. The occipital protuberance and crest, the interparietal and 

 the median frontal ridge are exceedingly prominent, while at the same time, 

 the crotaphyte depression, the temporal and digastric fossae and the supra 

 orbital fossae for the lodgement of the nasal glands are deep and well defined. 

 The frontal bone of Adamsii rises more rapidly than that of torquatus, leaving 

 a deeper fossa at the fronto-maxillary suture, and also producing chiefly the 

 difference which exists in the absolute height of the two crania. 



I append the detailed comparative measurements of the most important di- 

 mensions of the skulls of the two birds, which will show at a coup d'aiil the 

 absolute and relative difference in size and shape. Notice particularly the 

 great discrepancies in the longitudinal dimensions as compared with the slight 

 difference in the several transverse measurements.

Bemarks upon a Proposed Arrangement of the Family of GROUSE, and New 



Genera added. 



BY D. G. ELLIOT. 



It has seemed to me advisable to give in a condensed form, before treating 

 the subject in a more elaborate manner in my forthcoming Monograph, the 

 results of my investigations, and the arrangement I would propose for the 

 Grouse Family. 



Tetrao, than which no generic term has been more abused in its %pplica- 

 tion, for it appears to have been indiscriminately given to any gallinaceous 

 bird, strictly belongs only to Urog alius and Urogalloides. The former is the 

 typical Tetrao, as instituted by Linnaeus, and possesses the beard-like append- 

 age observed, save in its near ally, in no other bird of this family. 



America has no representative of this genus, the nearest approach to it 

 perhaps, in the form of the tail and general appearance, being the bird com- 

 monly known as Tetrao obscurus; but it would seem that, excepting the 

 single species of Bonasa sylvestris, no European grouse can be considered as 

 included even in the same genus with those inhabiting the New World. 



I would state here, that I am not now speaking of the Lagopidae, for I do 

 not consider them as strictly grouse. The synoptical list that I would, there- 

 fore, propose for this portion of the Tetronidae, is as follows : 



1st. The Genus Tetrao confined to Europe and Asia ; comprising T. uro- 

 gallus and T urogalloides. 



2d. Centrocercus confined to America ; comprising C. urophasianus. 

 3d. Lgrurus confined to Europe ; comprising L. tetrix. 



For the next group, as its members appear to possess sufficient characters 

 to distinguish the species from the commonly known T. Canadensis, in hav- 

 ing gular sacks, the extraordinary number of twenty feathers in the tail, 

 instead of sixteen, I would propose the term 



th. Dendragapus confined to America ; comprising D. obscurus and Rich- 

 ardscnii. 



5th. Canace confined to America ; comprising C. Canadensis and C. Frank- 

 linii. 



6th. I would propose, as a generic term, founded upon the peculiar forma- 

 tion of its primary feathers, the specific appellation Falcipennis confined to 

 Asia, and in compliment to its discoverer Hartlaubii. 



1th. Cupidonia confined to America ; comprising C. cupido. 



8th. Fedisecseles confined to America ; comprising P. columbianus and P. 

 phasianellus. 



9th. Bonasa Europe and America ; comprising B. umbellus, B. umbelloides, 

 B. sylvestris, and B. sabini. 



Tetrao derbianus (Gould), appears to be identical with the common tetrix. 

 This opinion is formed upon a specimen, kindly sent to me by Mr. Gould, 

 which he thinks is the same as the type. The latter is now in the Liverpool 

 Museum. 



I can discover no difference between this example and the usual style of 

 T. tetrix, except that the tail is a trifle longer ; but as this varies considerably 

 among the Black Grouse, I have deemed it advisable to consider the genus 

 Lyrurus as possessed of but one species.

* Mr. Lea is the first naturalist who has properly defined this genus, and his name Goniobasis 

 must therefore stand, in preference to any of the prior names given to artificial sections by the 

 Messrs. Adams. 



Of course these gentlemen are wrong in including species of this genus in the genera Pachy- 

 chet'ius, Ceriphasia, Potadoma and Hemisinus, which are all intended to embrace very different 

 groups of species. Prof. Haldeman is also mistaken in placing here the Pleurocera of Rafinesque, 

 a genus which undoubtedly = Trypanosoma, Lea. 



f This may be only an elevated form of Anculosa canalifera, Anthony. 



% This species and the preceding {gratiosa) are identical. Both descriptions bear the same date 

 of publication, and I am therefore unable to decide which has priority.

* Closely allied to G. oliva, Lea, but is larger, longer and tuberculate. 



t Nearly always tuberculate, and shouldered below the sutures. 



% G. decorata is a young shell, and, as is usual in this group, is sharply angulated at the peri- 

 phery. G. granata represents a half grown shell, and here the angle is almost obsolete, while G . 

 Tryoniana is the mature form. The entire identity of these several descriptions is proved by a 

 series of over two hundred specimens before me, 



Mr. lasts figure of Tryoniana belongs here, but his description of that species is made to include 

 the uext species, caelatura, Cunr. The green variety of granata is a shell of much heavier texture, 

 and may prove distinct. 



Half grown shell of caelatura. 



|| The Shastaensis of Mr. Lea is a very different shell, and certainly ought never to have been 

 confounded with this species, which it does not resemble in any particular.

* 1 1 have seen several author's examples of catenaria, and they uniformly represent shells not 

 adult. As 1 have not seen specimens of suhlirata an I Floridensis, I rely on the figures and des- 

 criptions only, in considering them to be the adults of the same species. 



J G. catenoides may prove to be a variety only of catenaria and I at first un'ted them,but I have 

 recently come to the conclusion that they are distinct species, though nearly allied. 



f) I presume it was Mr. Lea*s first intention to describe this species under the name of Etowah- 

 ensis, as a specimen is before me which that gentlemen sent to Mr. Anthony under that name. 

 This verj specimen was sent to Mr. Ueeve and published by him, prior to the publication of Can- 

 byi by Mr. Lea. 



It is extremely difficult to distinguish this species from varieties of papillosa, Anth. 



|| Dr. Brot considers this a synonym of Boykiniana, but it is Very different.

t Dr. Brot proposed the name Conradi for this species, as symmetrica is preoccupied by Prof. 

 Haldeman. I doubt whether it is distinct from G. carinifera, Lam. 



1 That all the species here quoted are synonyms of carinifera does not admit of doubt. The 

 species is rather a variable one in respect of proportions and ornamentation.

This is ouly a rather wide, young specimen of laqueata, as I have ascertained by the inspection 

 of some hundreds of specimens of that species. 



t Versipdlis resembles a young laqueata, but its texture is rruite heavy although small. 



j Described by Mr. Lea as a smooth species, but among a hundred perfect specimens before me, 

 oyer eighty are more or less plicate on the spire.

J The various synonyms of this species, inhabiting North and South Carolina, Alabama and 

 Tennessee, are all characterized by an identical form, although varying somewhat in color. Hav- 

 ing examined several hundred specimens, I find them to vary so much in that respect that I 

 cannot unite any of the so called species. 



jS Differs from symmetrica in being more cylindrical, with the whorls more flattened. 



|| I can obtain no information regarding this species except the meagre description. It Las 

 never been figured, and I cannot find specimens in our cabinets.

 stand, as it is not preoccupied in Goniobasis. 



j| The shells included in the above extensive synonymy present some variation in form and co- 

 loration, but in an examination of several thousand specimens I was unable to separate the so- 

 called species satisfactorily. G. semicarinata. Say, is the young shell, which, when old, varies in 

 form, being narrow in angustispira and exilis, and broader in the other synonyms. The species 

 inhabits an extensive range of country.

Dr. Leconte remarked, that his attention had been called to the following 

 passage in the Report on the progress of Entomology, by Dr. Gerstaecker, in 

 the last number of Truschel's Archiv fur Naturgeschichte, in which he refers 

 to the Classification of the Coleoptera of North America, Part 1, by Dr. Leconte. 



" Die Stylopiden setzt der Verf. unter die Heteromeren,, beirerkt aber das die 

 Tarsen nicht heteromer seieu, was richtig ist. Friiher habe man sie als eigne 

 Ordnung betrachtet, aber die Kenntniss ihrer Verwandlungen, und eine gen- 

 auere, [more rigid !] Interpretation ihrer auseren Baues habe fast alle [nearly 

 all!] Systematiker dazu bestimmt, sie unter die Kiifer zu bringen. (Welche 

 Charactere hat ein Strepsipteron mit einem Kiifer gemein ? Keinen ! Wo sind 

 die Ubereinstimmungen der Larven und ihrer Lebensweise ? Die Strepsipte- 

 ren Larven leben parasitiseh in Hinterleibe von Hymenopteren, die Meloi'den 

 Larven nahren sich von Honig ; beide haben also in der Lebensweise nichts 

 untereinander gemein.'') 



"In Elementarbuchern solite man Absurditaten am Wenigsten fur baare 

 Miinze ausgeben !" 



I do not propose here to enter into a discussion of the views which have in- 

 duced Lacordaire, Burmeister, Newman and Schaum to consider Stylopidse as 

 a family of Coleoptera, an opinion which many others have silently acquiesced 

 in. The subject was considered nearly exhausted, until reopened by Duval, in 



1864.] 4 




50 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



his note on the order Rhipiptera, (Gen. Col. Europe, 3,419), published subse- 

 quently to my work on Classification. 



I will, however, answer briefly the questions asked by Dr. Gerstaecker in the 

 passage above cited. 



The characters common to a Strepsipteron and various Coleoptera are these : 

 1. Hypermetamorphosis of the larva, (Sfeloidse) ; 2. Parasitism, (Rhipidias) ; 

 3. Retention of the Pupa within the skin of the larva, (Lampyridae, tribe Lycini, 

 genus Calopteron) ; 4. Unfitness of anterior wings for flight, (a character also 

 found in Orthoptera and Hemiptera, which, however, have no metamorphosis) ; 

 5. Large development of metathoracic segment. 



Even if the Stylopida? are considered as a distinct order Strepsiptera it 

 will be necessary to place them immediately after the Coleoptera. 



In view of the great variation of characters found in Coleoptera, it would seem 

 rational to consider Stylopidse as an extreme and degraded form of that order, 

 rather than to regard such a small number of objects, closely related in form, 

 structure and habits, as an equivalent to the great orders Coleoptera, Orthop- 

 tera and Hemiptera, with which alone they can be morphologically compared, 

 (characters 4 and 5). 



The information given by Dr. Gerstaecker regarding the difference in food 

 and manner of life between the larva? of Meloidce and Stylopidae, though not 

 original, is doubtless quite interesting, but seems to imply that I had compared 

 them together, which is not correct. 



Mr. Cassin called the attention of the Academy to the collection of birds 

 presented this evening by the Smithsonian Institution, and particularly referred 

 to several species of great rarity and scientific value. The Didunculus strigiros- 

 Iris is one of two species of birds now known to be approaching extinction, the 

 other species being Alca impennis. which is also in the Academy Museum. Thi3 

 bird is the most nearly allied to the extinct Dodo, formerly of the Isle of France, 

 and inhabits the Samoan or Navigator Islands. Its extinction or approach to 

 it is said to be owing to the introduction into those islands of the domestic cat. 

 Not more than four or five specimens are known to be extant. 



Other little known types were pointed out and exhibited to the Academy, 

 9uch as Carpophaga Aurorse, Carpophaga latrans, Artamus meiilalis and others. 

 Thi3 interesting series is from the collection of the Uniied States Exploring 

 Expedition of the Vincennes and Peacock, and is presented to the Academy by 

 the Smithsonian Institution.

Additions to the Catalogue of STARS which have Changed their Colors ; or 

 which have appeared with different Colors at different times.* 



BY JACOB ENNIS. 



Sirius. On the re-appearance of this star during the months of November 

 and December, 1863, I very carefully watched its color, Its decided change of 

 appearance since the early part of the year greatly interested me. Instead of 

 a full bright green, it was of a pale yellowish green. During those two months 

 the atmosphere passed through the extremes of variability, but the pale yellow- 

 ish green of Sirius remained constant. On the 29th of December I asked Dr. 

 Wilcocks, the discoverer of its being purple three years ago, how Sirius ap- 

 peared to him now? Without knowing my opinion, and without any hesita- 

 tion, he answered, " It is not as green as it was when visible last winter." 

 This coincidence of his views with my own confirms the idea that he was not 

 mistaken three years ago, as he since supposed, when he regarded the color of 

 Sirius to be violet. According to these evidences this great star has had five 

 distinct colors : red during the ancient times ; white in 1850, and subsequently ; 

 violet in 1861 ; full green in the autum and winter of 1862 3 ; pale yellowish 

 green in November and December of 1863. 



Note of April 19th, 1864. The above observations were written early in 

 January. For the last three or four weeks the green color of Sirius has again 

 been tinged with blue; but this evening no blue is visible, and the yellow 

 mingled with the green is conspicuous. In this I am confirmed by a member 

 of the Academy whose powers of observation are remarkably good. The clear- 

 ness of the atmosphere is perfect, but the moon is large and bright, and 1 have 

 a suspicion that the yellow of Sirius, though in a different quarter of the 

 heavens, may be due to the moon's reflected rays. The following portions of 

 this paper, except that on No. 21, were written previous to the 10th of Novem- 

 ber, 1863, at which date they were presented. 



Altair and Deneb, or Alpha Cygni. The former of these 6tars was de- 

 scribed by Humboldt in 1850 as yellow and the latter as white. They were 

 numbered 18 and 19 in this Catalogue, and announced to be blue in June, 

 1863. I had watched them for several months nearly every clear night, and, 

 on the 20th of August, I first noticed that they were green. On all good nights 

 since then they have appeared to myself and to others, whose opinions 1 have 

 solicited, to be conspicuously green ; but on damp, slightly hay nights, from 

 the effects of the atmosphere, they appear blue. It is rather oppressive for 

 me to make this announcement, for I have been obliged already, in a former 

 communication, to say that two other large stars, Sirius and Vega, had changed 

 from blue to green. Certainly this change does not arise from any peculiari- 

 ties of vision, for I have in all cases carefully consulted the views of others 

 and found them to accord with my own. I know not how to attribute the 

 change to atmospheric causes, for I had observed them all, except Sirius, to be 

 blue several months before, in all weathers. 



Vega. For the last four or five weeks, thi3 star has not appeared to me as 

 green as during last summer. Its rather bluish appearance may, perhaps, be 

 attributed to greater haziness of the atmosphere. 



Castor. See No. 10 of this Catalogue. In addition to the colors already 

 given, the two companions of this double star have been described as follows . 

 Yellow and yellowish by Sestini ; greenish yellow and green by Dembowski ;

20. Arcturus. This is one of the stars denominated red by the ancients' 

 In modern times, according to reliable observations, it has changed its color 

 J. F. Julius Schmidt, formerly of Ulmutz, recently made Director of the AstFO- 

 nornioal Observatory at Athens, and distinguished for his observations on 

 variable stars, which he communicated to the Ast. Nach., says, that for eleven 

 years he had considered Arcturus to be one of the reddest of the stars, and, 

 especially in 1841, he had ranked it in color with Mars. To his surprise in 

 1852 he saw it to be yellow, and entirely destitute of any reddish hue. It 

 then appeared to him by the naked eye lighter than Capella. Capella two 

 years before had been described by Humboldt as yellow, with scarcely a tinge 

 of red ; since then Capella has become blue. During the present year, 1863, 

 I have dozens of times and in all weathers observed Arcturus to be decidedly 

 orange, and of a clear, beautiful color. In this I have been confirmed by 

 other observers. The colors of Arcturus may therefore be stated as having 

 been red, yellow and orange. 



References have already been made in this Catalogue to the changes of color 

 in double and multiple stars. The numbers, such as 3 : 7J, immediately after 

 the names of the fallowing double stars, indicate the magnitudes of the com- 

 panions. The authorities are given after the colors. Some of these I have 

 taken from the original papers, and some I have not so verified, but presume 

 them all to be correct. 



21. 95 Herculis, 5 : 5. Hitherto catalogued as a diversely colored pair of 

 stars to an extreme degree: one being described as apple green and the other 

 as cherry red, and also as an astonishing yellow green and an egregious red. 

 In 1856 58 they were nearly colorless and without any diversity of tint, and 

 in this latter manner they were described by Struve in 1832 3, and by Sestini 

 in 1844 5. Hence a probability of their being colorless once in about twelve 

 years." C. Piazzi Smyth.* 



In the November number, 1863, of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astro- 

 nomical Society, a suggestion is made, from very high authority, that because 

 the changes in the two companions have in all these cases been simultaneous, 

 they are liable to the suspicion of having been produced by instrumental 

 causes. But this apparent simultaneousness of change may have been pro- 

 duced by a real change in only one of them. If the two stars were white and 

 one of them were to change to an " egregious red," then by contrast in close 

 proximity, from the well known principle of complementary colors, the other 

 would necessarily appear green. The operation of this principle has been very 

 conspicuous in this city during political demonstrations and celebrations, when 

 bright red lights have been kept burning in the streets. The ordinary gas- 

 lights all around them have appeared strongly green. It is submitted that this 

 cause for the simultaneous change in both stars is more probable by far than 

 that three different instruments, in the hands of three different men, in three 

 different countries and at as many different periods, should all, from some un- 

 known cause, fall into the same error ; and this not when directed at the stars 

 generally, but only when pointed to a particular one.

42. Gamrna Lyra?, of 3d magnitude. Both these stars, Beta Lyra? and Gam- 



Lyra;, seem to be changing their colors. Herschel, Sr., and South 

 gave Beta as white. Next, Smyth, in 1834, gave the general im- 

 pression as whi:e, the four companions being in the following 

 order: very while and splendid, pale grey, faint yellow, light blue. 

 He gave Gamma Lyra? then as being bright yellow. Schmidt re- 

 garded the colors of both Beta and Gamma the same yellowish 

 white from 1844 to 1855. Webb, in 1849 50, regarded Gamma 

 as much less yellow than Beta, if not white. In 1862, the latter 

 observer found Gamma the paler in tint, though the difference was 

 not considerable. According to these statements Beta changed from 

 white to yellow and Gamma from yellow to white. Both were of 

 the same color, yellowish white, according to Schmidt, about 

 1844. The only discrepancy is Schmidt, for the latter portion of 

 his time, the former portion being remarkably confirmative.

 some find it tawny and ruddy. The details are curious but too 

 long for insertion here. Other small stars show a similar uncer- 

 tainty-" Webb. 

 The frequent changes in some of these stars, the last three or four of this 

 Catalogue especially, are remarkable, and seem inexplicable to astronomers. I 

 presume the difficulty arises, not as is supposed from the atmosphere, or from the 

 instruments, or from personal peculiarities, but chiefly from the frequency of the 

 real changes in the stars. If, for instance, it be complained that " Secchi's 

 colors are uncertain and variable," it is because in such instances the colors 

 of the stars are uncertain aud variable. 



An addition has been made to the title of this Catalogue to obviate the ob- 

 jection that possibly some of the apparent changes of color of the stars may 

 be merely the errors of observation, or the effects of the atmosphere, and not 

 real changes in the celestial bodies. Nevertheless, an apparent change is a- 

 fact in the constitution of the world, and deserves a notice and an explana- 

 tion. From whatever causes these changes may arise, there is needed a faithful 

 collection of all the facts in this department of astronomy. They are scattered 

 about in many volumes and many various scientific depositories, and no one, 

 as far as I am aware, has brought them together or made them a special study. 

 But in making such a collection, or catalogue, no changes should be omitted. 

 Whether we regard them as apparent or real, whether they be small or great, 

 whether they may have been slow or sudden, none should be suppressed by 

 the compiler in his catalogue. To admit some and reject others because in 

 his opinion some are right and others are wrong, would be making his work a 

 confused medley of facts and opinions unworthy of reliance. If, as appears 

 undeniable, there be changes in the colors of the stars, then, from the nature 

 of things, there may be small changes as well as great ones. To reject a re- 



1864.] 




56 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



corded change simply because it is small, would therefore be a real misrepre- 

 sentation of the case, and a virtual falsification of the records. Moreover, 

 the colors as they stand recorded are from experienced observers, men whose 

 lives have been devoted to an accurate representation of facts, who do nothing 

 without care and deliberation, and whose common and avowed practice is not 

 to record any color when the atmosphere is not favorable for such obser- 

 vations. 



As already stated, there are difficulties in deciding on colors by the naked 

 eye when the star is not large, and when the departure from white is small. 

 But this difficulty is not in the way of large stars, as Arcturus and Sirius ; 

 nor does it apply to the telescope, except in the very smallest magnitudes. To 

 decide between two different colors, such as red and blue, is never difficult ; 

 and when two colors are blended, it is the custom to name them both, a3 bluish 

 green, reddish yellow, and the like. The disturbing effects of the atmosphere, 

 or of the instrument, may be detected either immediately or after several nights 

 of observation. The atmosphere cannot color one star and leave all the other 

 stars in the same neighborhood uncolored. The telescope cannot act pecu- 

 liarly on any one star ; it must treat all alike, especially of the same magni- 

 tude and color. Simple comparison is therefore an admirable test ; and another 

 important test is time watchfulness every night through different changes of 

 weather. If hereafter even this shall not beVound satisfactory in any one locality, 

 then simultaneous observations at widely distant places will most certainly 

 eliminate all suspicion of mistake. For instance, observations may be made 

 at Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, and Chili in the southern hemisphere; 

 and in the northern hemisphere both on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of 

 America, on the Atlantic coast of Europe, in Russia, and in Hindoostan. If 

 the star shall prove of the same color at all these different regions at the same 

 time in favorable weather, then that color may be regarded as unquestionable. 

 Even by using one locality alone absolute certainty may be acquired, as the 

 red colors of Aldebaran, Betelgueze, and Antares. The same certainty may 

 be looked for hi this as in other departments of astronomy, and even greater 

 certainty than in many. There is an uncertainty, in opinions of wise men, of 

 three millions of miles in the distance of the earth from the sun ; and yet this 

 uncertain distance is used as a measuring line to fathom other and far greater 

 distances. But this uncertainty to so large a degree does not take away from 

 the supreme value of the determinations nevertheless. These determinations, 

 with all their known reservations, are held as of the highest importance. So 

 in the colors of the stars ; mistakes may be made, the intermixtures of 

 error may certainly exist, though we cannot tell exactly where they are, and 

 yet the present recorded observations are precious beyond estimation. And a 

 time is coming when simultaneous observations from various positions in both 

 hemispheres will render them beyond suspicion. To hasten on this time we 

 have only to make good use of the materials already on hand. 



Why the changes in the colors of the stars are not more frequently observed, 

 was pointed out in a former communication. Why the belief in their real oc- 

 currence is hard to be admitted, and why their observed changes are ascribed 

 to supposable errors from the instruments, from the atmosphere, and from per- 

 sonal deficiencies, seems to arise from the opinion that such vast bodies cannot 

 possibly undergo great changes in a shoit time. But this opinion rests on do 

 known scientific grounds. When fairly viewed, the fixedness of the colors of 

 the stars should not seem more likely than the fixedness of their positions. 

 Indeed the two ideas are very much alike. In ancient phrase, the stars were 

 said to be " rivetted " to the vault of heaven. Now we know from observations 

 more refined that many of them move, and we have a conviction, from the na- 

 ture of attraction, that they must all move. In like manner, in a universe 

 where every known object is subject to change in various ways, our first ideas 

 should be that the colors of all the stars must change. Hence we should ap- 

 proach the recorded changes with favorable judgments. If we are to have any 



[March 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 57 



prepossessions in the case, they should be that the changes are real in the stars 

 themselves. And when we reflect on the habitual caution of long experienced 

 observers, men whose very existence is devoted to the accurate delineation 

 of fact, we should place a high reliance on their recorded observations, and 

 not think that they have lightly allowed themselves to be imposed upon by 

 optical illusions. 



I cannot hope to be able to add anything to the knowledge of practised ob- 

 servers respecting the sources of error and the rules to be observed in making 

 observations ; but as these have never, that I am aware, been embodied in 

 print, I offer the following, chiefly for the assistance of the many who may 

 be disposed so observe the larger stars with the naked eyes. Such stars are 

 indeed very few, but the observations may be the more useful from being made 

 frequently and by many persons. 



1. Damp and slightly hazy atmospheres make a green star appear blue. 

 This may be from the same principle that the deep ocean, the clear sky, and 

 the distant mountains appear blue. Damp nights that are perfectly clear do 

 not have this effect. 



2. Moonlight greatly obscures the colors of the stars, giving them a yellowish 

 hue. 



3. Before the daybreak makes its appearance in the east, the rays of the sun 

 refracted through the higher regions of the atmosphere, may cause a general 

 whiteness of the stars. 



4. Artificial lights reaching the eye obscure the colors of the stars. 



5. On account of the faintness of the light of the stars, the eye of.en requires 

 to be fixed upon them for a considerable time before their impressions take 

 full effect. 



6. Comparisons between neighboring stars, and some practice in star ob- 

 servations, are often necessary to decide on the real colors of the stars. 



7. The atmosphere must have like effects upon similar stars in the same 

 neighborhood. Hence a peculiarity observed in any star may be brought to a 

 determination. 



8. Observations on the same star during a considerable interval of time and 

 through different changes of weather, may aid in giving confidence to a deter- 

 mination. 



9. Perfect independence and candor are necessary. Our previous judgments 

 are apt to warp these dalioate impressions on the retina, and whether we have 

 derived these judgments from ourselves or others, we must be careful to lay 

 them completely aside. For want of doing this we may not notice a change of 

 color, although such a change may have been before our vision. 



10. Personal peculiarities of vision may be ascertained by consultation with 

 others. 



11. Discrepancies between the accounts of two observers may arise from 

 differences of dates ; hence, in apprehension of sudden and frequent changes in 

 the stars, the dates of observations should be carefully given. m 



Description of a new Labroid Genus allied to TROCHOCOPUS Gthr. 



BY THEODORE GILL. 



Dr. Ayres bas indicated, under the name Labrus pulcher, a Californian 

 representative of the family of Labroids. That species was subsequently 

 referred by Dr. Glinther to his genus Stinicossyphus, in which it was retained 

 by myself with the proviso that " its generic position remains to be con- 

 firmed, although there is little doubt that it really is a Semicossyphus." Hav- 

 ing since received, through the kindness of Dr. Cooper, a specimen of the 

 species, I find that it has not the "lateral teeth distinct," as in Semicossyphus, 

 but an " obtuse osseous ridge round the edge of the jaws, without distinct 

 lateral teeth," as in Trochocopus Gthr., to which Gunther should have referred 

 it. I am not acquainted with his reasons for considering the species closely

Body oblong, moderately compressed, with the caudal peduncle little 

 oblong and not constricted: anus subcentral. 



Scales generally rather small, in about fifty-five to sixty-five transverse 

 rows; on the breast smallest: each scale is oblong, subangulated behind, 

 little convex or truncated at base, corrugated at the centre, with numerous 

 lines radiating backwards towards the base and sides ; and in front with 

 generally undulated lines parallel with the sides ; exposed surface vertically 

 rhomboid.

 rather small. Cheeks covered with small scales ; larger ones on all the 

 opercular bones, except the preoperculum, whose limbs are naked. Oper- 

 cular bones unarmed ; suboperculum with no membranaceous extension. 

 Nostrils minute, simple, in front of the upper portion of the eye. 



Mouth little protractile, with the cleft oblique. Lips thick and plicated. 



Intermaxillary and supramaxillary bones connected by arthrodial articula- 

 tion ; intermaxillaries with the ascending processes about as long as the 

 horizontal and extending nearly to the eyes, little curved and oblong cunei- 

 form in profile for two-thirds of their length, oblong subtrihedral behind; 

 the horizontal limbs uniformly wide, thick but compressed, and with a pro- 

 minent articulation behind. Supramaxillars divided into two parts ; an 

 anterior laminar behind and within the posterior part, widening towards the 

 front into a somewhat concave or channeled process arthrodially articulated 

 with the outer surface of the intermaxillars, and thence recurrent in a nearly 

 parabolic curve backwards and thence downwards to the front to articulate 

 with the inner surface of the intermaxillars ; the posterior portion of the 

 supramaxillars is flat and expanded backwards towards its iuferior angle, and 

 ceases nearly under the front of the eye. Dentary rapidly increasing in 

 height towards the angle. 



Teeth on the crest of the jaws cylindro-conic and obtuse, completely iso- 

 lated ; four in front of the jaws developed as large curved blunt canines; 

 the hindermost one in jaw above sometimes little larger than the preceding ; 

 in others a true canine :* on the inner surface of the jaws, granular and 

 pluriserial.

 anterior portion. 



Anal fin with three graduated spines, and with its soft portion opposite and 

 similar to, that of the dorsal.

transversely triangular, scarcely sinuous behind and uniformly high, with its 

 ends scarcely curved backwards to its posterior facettes, which are narrow, 

 little prominent above and separated from the dentigerous area by a con- 

 traction ; the shaft is laminar, expanded obliquely downwards and forwards. 

 The teeth on the body are nearly uniform, moderate, and paved, and on the 

 crest of the shaft obtusely cylindro-conic. The upper pharyngeal bones are 

 high, curved in front, on which is a tessellated pavement and which is nearly 

 rectangular to the inferior surface, which is paved towards the inner side with 

 moderate and towards the outer with minute teeth. 



The gill rakers on the outer surface of the first branchial arch are 

 short compressed, parallel with the arch, bi- or multidentate ; the others are 

 oblique and more or less compressed at right angle to the arches. 



Type Pimelometopon pulcher Gill. 



This genus is very closely related to Trochocopus (Giinther), but differs in 

 the possession of a greater number of scales and the form of the head. It is 

 also solely represented by species found along the western coasts of America 

 and the appertaining islands, while Trochocopus is a peculiar African type, 

 so far as yet known. 



Of the two known species of this genus, one the type was originally 

 described as a Labrus by Ayres in San Francisco ; the other was first made 

 known by Jenyns under the generic name Cossyphus and was afterwards, by 

 Valenciennes, described as a new species of Labrus. Dr. Giinther subse- 

 quently referred the Californian species to his genus Semicossyphus and the 

 species of Jenyns and Valenciennes to Trochocopus; he was acquainted 

 with neither through autopsy. Finally, the writer, following Giinther and 

 unacquainted with either Semicossyphus or Trochocopus, retained the Cali- 

 fornian species in the former genus. 



Pimclomotopon belongs to the subfamily of Chccropinse as understood by 

 me. It is proper to here remark that, by an evident inadvertence, the sub- 

 family Pseudolabriformes of Bleeker was formerly* enumerated among those 

 considered valid by myself, instead of among those requiring revision. 



There are two known species of the genus Pimelometopon: 



Pimelometopon pulcher Gill = Labrus pulcher Ayres Semicossyphus 

 pulcher Giinther, Gill. 



California. 



Pimelometopon Darwinii Gill = Cossyphus Darwinii Jenyns = Labrus 

 aper Val. 



Gallopagos Islands. 



N. B. In anticipation of a special paper, I may here state that the Sebastes! 

 helvomaculatus of Ayres is the true Sebastes rosaceus of Girard, (Sebastomusf ro- 

 saceus Gill,) widely different from the Sebastodes ! rosaceus of Ayres. The latter 

 may be named Sebaslosomus pinniger. 



Note on the Nomenclature of Genera and Species of the Family 

 ECHENEIDOIDJE. 



BY THEODORE GILL. 



In order to correct the nomenclature of two of the genera of the family 

 Echeneidoidse, the following paper is submitted. I also embrace the oppor- 

 tunity of restoring to proper rank, as the true names of peculiar species, two 

 which have been connected with forms to which they do not truly belong. 



M. Auguste Dumeril, in a "Prodrome" of a projected Monograph of the 



family, (Comptes Rendus, tome 47, 1858, pp. 374 378,) has proposed to 



distribute the species among two groups, one typified by Echeneis nnicrates, 



and named Nancrates, and the other, represented by E. remora and called 



Remores. Elevating these types with others to independent generic rank, I

have restricted Echeneis to the genus typified by E. naucrates and called that 

 one typified by E. remora, Remora, which name Dr. Bleeker has since ac- 

 cepted. On examining the works of Linnaeus and Artedi, I find, however, 

 that E. rnnora was the only species referred to that genus by Linnaeus in the 

 earlier editions of the Systema Naturae, and by Artedi ; and that in the later 

 editions, Linnaeus placed that species at the head of the genus. The E. re- 

 mora must consequently be regarded as the type of the genus, and a new 

 name (Leptecheneis) conferred on E. naucrates. The genera of Echeneidoidae 

 will then be known by the following names : 



REMORSE. 



Echeneis Remora L. 



Echeneis L., Art. Type, Echeneis remora L. 

 Remoropsis Gill. Type, Echeneis brachyptera Lowe. 

 Rhombochiius Gill. Type, Echeneis osteochir Cuv. 



Remilegia Gill. Type, Echeneis australis Bznnet = Echeneis scutata 

 Giinther. 



LEPTECHENEIDES. 



5. Leptecheneis Gill. Type, Echeneis neucrates L. 



6. Phtheirichthys Gill. Type Echeneis lineatus Menzies. 



In a Synopsis given in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sci- 

 ences of Philada., for April, 1862, (p. 239,) an analytical table is given, in 

 which the genera are distributed as follows : 



Echeneides (Echeneis = Leptecheneis, Phtheirichthys.) 

 Remorae (Remora = Echeneis, Remilegia.) 



Subsequently, (op. cit., 1863, p. 8S,) the genera Remoropsis and Rhombo- 

 chirus weie added. 



The genus Remilegia is known to me chiefly through the excellent figure 

 accompanying Giinther's valuable account of the family in the " Annals and 

 Magazine of Natural History," (vol. v. 1860, pp. 386402.) On the other 

 hand, I have enjoyed the opportunity of examining two types, Rhombo- 

 chirus and Phtheirichthys, not seen by that gentleman. 



While fully appreciating the great service rendered to science by Dr. Giin- 

 ther in reducing the synonymy of the present family, and in many respects 

 agreeing with him in his views regarding the limits of the species and their 

 synonymy, I am compelled to differ from him, especially regarding the 

 nomenclature of the species called by him Echeneis Holbrookii Gthr., and E. 

 scutata Gthr., believing that both had long previously received names known, 

 indeed, to him, but referred to species which they did not really represent. 



Echeneis Holbroohi of Giinther, Cat., should have been called Echeneis albi- 

 cauda, as it is the Echeneis albicauda of Mitohill. Mitchill's name is, indeed, in- 

 cluded, with special emphasis, in the synonymy of Giinther's Echeneis nau- 

 crates (Leptecheneis neucrates), but the following juxtaposition of all essential 

 characters given by both authors will show the incorrectness of this view : 



" E. naucrates." " E. Holbrookii." u E. albicauda." 



Disk "(21) 22-25 (26)" 

 " The length of the 

 disk 4A 4 4 in the to- 

 tal or twice the width 

 of the body between the 

 pectorals." Gthr., ii. p. 

 384.

 4 4 | X 2) = 1 : 9

"The length of the

 and a half; breadth al- 

 most three." Mitohill.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 61 



As Mitchill's notice of Echeneis albicauda gives a relative width, to the 

 body even greater than that attributed by Giinther to his E. Holhrookii, and 

 far greater than that assigned by him to E. naucrat.es, and as Echeneis albi- 

 cauda has "twenty-one bars across the shield," also in E. Holhrookii 

 "the number of laminas has been constantly found to be twenty-one a 

 number of very rare occurrence in E. naucrates," the reasons for Giinther's 

 insistence on the reference of Mitchill's name to E. naucrates and bestowal 

 of a new one on his species are not evident. I cannot appreciate the force of 

 his remark that Mitchill's " is an imaginary species," and that the name, 

 " as is qui'e clear, was originally not intended for the fish afterwards de- 

 scribed by Holbrook as E. lineata, but merely for specimens of E. naucrates 

 with a white margin to the fins." 



Long before the communications of Mitchill, and as early as the year 1788, 

 a species of the genus Leptechcneis was made known by Zuiew in a special 

 article (Eche?ieidis nova species) in the Nova Acta Academise Scientiarum Im- 

 perialis Petropolitanae (iv. 279 283, tab. VI.) The species was well and 

 elaborately described and illustrated, and was especially distinguished from 

 E. naucrates by the much longer lower jaw and the longer disk, which 

 nevertheless had a smaller number of lamina? (20.) The species thus intro- 

 duced was named Echeneis neucratoides ; its habitat was unknown. 



While it is thus seen that two forms with a comparatively small number 

 of lamina? had been early made known, and that the proportions assigned to 

 one agreed nearly with those attributed to E. Holhrookii by Giinther, it is 

 necessary to add that none of the specimens examined by myself had so long 

 a disk or so wide a body as the individuals noticed by Giinther, although I 

 have had tbe opportunity of examining specimens of the genus exhibiting 

 every gradation between eighteen and twenty-five lamina?. I shall not, how- 

 ever, offer any decided opinion at present, but close with the assertion that 

 DeKay's and Holbrook's specimens had not the proportions of the E. Hol- 

 hrookii of the Acanthopterygian Fishes, but agreed with those seen by my- 

 self. As GQnther's E. Holhrookii was entirely founded on the E. lineata of 

 Holbrook in the first instance, that name must of course be considered as a 

 synonym. 



The Echeneis scutata of Giinther had first received a name from F. D. Ben- 

 nett in his ' ' Narrative of a Whaling Voyage round the Globe, from the year 

 1833 to 1836."* In that work, Bennett gave a very recognizable description 

 of it under the name Echeneis austrahs.\ Bennett's name has been referred 

 by Giinther to the synonymy of Lrptecheneis neucrates, like E. albicauda, 

 but, as will be shown, erroneously. Bennett has stated that the E. australis 

 exceeds the E. remora especially recognized by Giinther as that species in 

 size. "One individual captured, and which was by no means the largest 

 one observed, measured one foot five inches in length, and was proportionally 

 broad." This statement at once would render the identity of the species 

 with E. nait'crates extremely improbable, as the latter species has an incom- 

 parably more slender body. The further statement that the dorsal has " 21" 

 rays, and the anal "24," completes the evidence of its difference from L. 

 neucrates, that species having the formula D. "(21) 22 25 (2(3) 3341. A 

 3238," (Giinther). As Bennett's formula (" D. 21. A. 24") specially 

 agrees with Giinther's formula of E. scutata (" D. 27 | 22. A. 2123"), 

 and, as of three examples of Bennett's species, "one only had 24 stride on 

 the buckler, the other two had 26," thus also specifically agreeing with E. scu- 

 tata (" D. 27 | "), the identity of the two nominal species is almost certain, 

 and Bennett's name (Remilegia australis,) as the prior one, must be accepted. 



* Op.cit., vol. ii. 1840, p. 273. 



t The name of Echeneis australis was first introduced into Science by Bennett, as that of anew 

 ppecies. A Lepteclieneis probably L. neucrates had beca previously figured in Griffith's Cuvier 

 under the English name ot " Australian remora," but no attempt at identification of the two was 

 made by Bennett, and the species belong to widely distinct genera.

Notes on the BIRDS of Jamaica. 



BY W. T. MARCH. 



With remarks by S F. Brd. 



III. 

 ARDEIDJZ. 



All the North American Ardeidae are to be obtained in the Island of Jamaica. 

 The Ganlins and Bitterns are of more frequent occurrence than the larger He- 

 rons, and are found at all seasons and in every part of the island where 

 there is water, at the cattle ponds, along the river courses, in the mangrove 

 swamps, lagoons, and marshes, and in considerable numbers on tbe neighbor- 

 ing islets and kays during the breeding season. The Ardeidae all build on 

 trees ; the nests are platforms, constructed of sticks filled in with leaves, 

 trash, twigs and bark, forming a shallow bedding, on which the eggs are de- 

 posited. In the mangroves the nest is composed principally of the decaying 

 pods of the black mangrove. 



The eggs of all are emerald green, or rather, of the tint called aqua- 

 marine, varying in shade, and in dimensions according to the size of the 

 bird ; those of the Gaulins are four or five in number, measuring about 



1 , (j by 1 jg of an inch; the typical eggs rounded at both ends, though 

 some are pointed at one end ; a small kay off Old Harbor, known as Barebush 

 Kay, is a favorite resort of all the Gaulins, Bitterns and Night Herons during 

 the breeding season. 



The larger Herons are not of so frequent occurrence as the Gaulins and 

 other Ardeidae during the late spring and summer months ; but Ardea hero- 

 dias and Herodias egretta are not uncommon during the autumn and winter ; 

 they are, however, more difficult of approach than the smaller species, being 

 very wary and vigilant ; their resort during the breeding season is usually 

 to the deep recesses of the mangrove swamps and morasses. Their eggs are 

 of similar form and color, but larger than those of the Night Heron. I have 

 not often met with the nest of the larger Herons ; but have notes of two, 

 one from Salt Island Creek, Herodias egretta, containing three eggs, and 

 the other, Ardea herodias with four eggs from the Ferry Lagoon. On both 

 occasions the nests were taken from the topmost branches of a Corkwood 

 (Anona palusiris). The Herons are generally in good condition from the fall 

 of the year until the following spring, but, as with most of the fish-feeding 

 birds, must be divested of the skin, which otherwise imparts a rank and 

 unpleasant flavor to the flesh. 



There are periods, but not of long continuance, in which the Egrets, par- 

 ticularly the White, are seen several together, iu our marshes. The numbar 

 may be twelve or twenty. They seem attracted by some prevalent living 

 food on these occasions ; ordinarily they feed singly, or at most in couples, in 

 the shaded spots of our rivers above the water shoal. There are collected 

 at the present time (January, 1864) at a sedgy pond near Spanish Town up- 

 wards of twenty, principally Garzetta candidissima, with a few of Herodias 

 &gretta, Florida cccrulea and Demiegretta ludoviciana and nivea. 



110. Florida csrulea. The length of the Blue Gaulin or Florida Heron is 

 about 22 inches, expanse 36^, flexure 11, leg 4, bill 3 ; occipital feathers 

 lengthened, without a crest; prevailing color dark indigo blue, head and 

 neck with a purplish tinge ; dorsal plumes lengthened ; wing feathers grey- 

 ish beneath ; iris yellow, orbits light blue, bill leaden blue ; legs and feet 

 black. The young are white with spots of blue about the wings and body ; 



[Mar. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHrA. 63 



iris whitish, orbits and base of the bill yellowish, bill light blue, legs drill 

 yellowish, bill light blue, legs dull greeu. 



109. Garzetta candidissima. I find the Suowy Heron of as frequent oc- 

 currence as the Red-Necked and Blue Gaulin. Color snowy white, with 

 occipital and dorsal plumes loosely fibred and much lengthened. Iris yellow- 

 ish, bill black, with the base and lower portion of the lower mandible and 

 space round the eye yellow; legs black, feet yellow; length 26 inches, ex- 

 panse 371, flexure 10^, leg 4, bill 3, middle toe 3. 



10S. Garzetta nivea. Mr. Gosse's Common Gaulin has been supposed to 

 be the immature " Florida coerulea," but I think, on careful examination and 

 comparison, it is quite distinct, the color is always pure white, without 

 any blue feathers about the body or wings, or any distinct crest. The tips of 

 the first six wing quills only are edged on both webs with greyish black. Iris 

 pale yellow ; orbits, cheeks and legs bluish green ; bill bluish black, with 

 the base and larger portion of the lower mandible yellow. Length 24 inches, 

 expanse 39, flexure 10|, leg 4, bill 3, tail 4. 



111. Demiegretta ludoviciana. The Red-necked Egret, or Gaulin, is one 

 of the most common. The general color of the adult above is slatey blue, 

 the feathers tipped with reddish ; chin and a stripe down the throat and 

 other under parts tawney white ; breast and neck red, shaded into purplish. 

 Iris yellowish white; space round the eye fulvous; bill brownish black, 

 lower mandible clayish yellow beneath; legs yellowish green. Length 25 \ 

 inches, expanse 37, flexure 10}, bill and leg 4 each. The white occipital and 

 colored dorsal plumes straight, fastigiate, the latter generally longer than 

 the tail. The immature bird has the upper plumage reddish, mixed with 

 blue. 



Demiegretta rufa. The Reddish Egret or Gaulin is scarce, as I have only 

 seen two specimens ; it appears to be only an occasional visitor. 



Adult. General color greyish blue, paler beneath; head, neck and throat 

 reddish chestnut. Dorsal plumes with yellowish tips, straight, fastigiate, 

 and longer than the tail. Iris greyish white, space round the eye and bill 

 dull flesh-color; the terminal half of the bill black, legs and feet blue, with 

 blackish scales ; claws blackish. Length 30 inches, expanse 43, flexure 12f , 

 leg 5^, bill 3}. 



116. Herodias egretta. The White Egret or Heron is the most common 

 of the larger species. The dimensions are, length 38 inches, expanse 55, or 

 more, flexure 16, tail 5, bill more than 5, and leg nearly 6 inches. Color 

 pure white ; no occipital crest. Dorsal plumes with stiffened shafts, longer 

 than the tail and pendant. Iris yellow ; bill yellowish to the point, dusky 

 above, legs and feet black. 



163. Ardea occidentalis. The Great White Heron is rare in the island ; 

 it is readily distinguished from ^he preceding by the larger size, the length- 

 ened occipital feathers, and an absence of the dorsal plumes and some other 

 peculiarities. The color is also pure white. Iris yellow, orbits yellowish 

 green, bill yellow, greenish at the base ; legs yellow, with olive tinge in front, 

 claws light brownish. Length 45 inches, expanse 68, or more, flexure nearly 

 20, leg nearly 9 inches, bill 5. 



115. Ardea herodias. The Great Blue Heron is more abundant in some 

 years than in others. The prevailing color is ashy blue, some feathers tinged 

 reddish ; crown feathers and scapulars elongated ; chin and under tail coverts 

 white ; edge of wing and a patch on shoulder rufous and white ; neck ashy 

 cinnamon brown ; color of throat white, streaked with black and reddish 

 brown ; plumes of the breast ashy and white ; bally streaked black and 

 1864.]

white ; sides black. Wing quills blackish. ; thigh rufous ; tail bluish. Iris 

 yellowish, with hazel pupil ; bill with lower mandible yellow, dark flesh- 

 colored at the base ; upper mandible reddish horn, lighter on the edges ; 

 tongue whitish, mouth deep rosy flesh-colored ; leg, feet and claws black, 

 scales with whitish edges ; thighs, a short space from the knee, and a stripe 

 back and front black, the rest tawny ; palms dull clayish. 



The dimensions of the adult male are, length 46 inches, expanse 74, flex- 

 ure 19, bill 6|, leg 7, thigh 9, middle toe 4|. 



This species is very variable, rarely agreeing exactly in the dimensions and 

 m the coloring of the head and belly. The female and young male generally 

 have the head black without the white center, and the breast and under tail 

 coverts greyish, streaked with white and blackish. The sack or stomach 

 of one shot at the river side near Spanish Town was filled with small river 

 shrimps and water snails, intermixed with small pieces of river grass (Cera- 

 lophyllum demersum) evidently pulled up in taking the food ; and in the gullet 

 of another shot at Great Salt Pond was a mullet nearly eight inches in 

 length. 



275. Ardea Wurdemannii ? The White-crowned Heron is in the upper 

 plumage very like the preceding, but has the crown and occipital elongated fea- 

 thers white ; the under parts white, streaked with black ; the breast bluish 

 black, with bluish grey or ashy on the sides. Length nearly 50 inches, ex- 

 panse 75 or more, flexure 21, leg 8, middle toe about 13, thigh 9, bill 6-. 

 Greenish brown, yellowish beneath. 



The fishermen and gunners on the coast say this is the male of the preced- 

 ing species in summer plumage, but, from two specimens I have collected, I 

 think they are quite distinct. 



113. Ardetta exilis. The Tortoise-shell Bittern is not uncommon among 

 the mangroves and along the banks of streams. It is generally found soli- 

 tary. Length 13^ inches, expanse 17 to 18, flexure 4} to 5, bill and leg each 

 nearly 2. The prevailing colors of this Bittern are dark glossy green and 

 purplish cinnamon mixed with tawny. Iris and bill yellow, the latter darker 

 at the tips, legs tawny. The head and back of the female are chestnut in- 

 stead of green and cinnamon. The eggs are small. 



112. Butorides virescens. The Crab Catcher is found as a solitary bird in 

 almost every locality in which there is water. The dimensions are, length 

 17 to 20 inches, expanse 25 to 28, flexure 7 to 8, leg and bill 2 to 2^. Head 

 with crest glossy green, upper parts of body green, wing coverts edged with 

 tawny brown ; neck and sides of throat chestnut : chin white ; line down 

 the centre of throat white, intermixed with greenish and chestnut ; under 

 parts and sides leaden ash. Iris yellow ; upper mandible black, lower man- 

 dible yellow, with black edge ; legs and feets dusky greenish yellow. The 

 mature male has two stripes on the side of the head towards the ear, with a 

 white stripe streaked with black between them. 



This species also builds on trees in the morasses and swamps, and on river 

 banks overhanging the streams. The eggs are nearly as large as those of the 

 Gaulins. 



Butorides beunnescexs. A Cuban species is supposed to be found here, 

 but I have not recognized it in any of my collections. From Gundlach's de- 

 scription this differs from the preceding in having the tip of the lower mandi- 

 ble greenish white ; skin of face olive black ; round the eye yellowish green ; 

 legs olive brown ; lesser wing coverts and small quills dark metallic green, 

 with rusty edges ; large quills without white ; lesser under coverts grey ; 

 Throat yellowish brown, dark grey at base ; foreneck blackish, with metallic 

 green lustre, rusty tips and pale yellowish lateral edges. It also wants the 

 white and black streaked line from the angle of the mouth towards the ear 



[March. 




NATURAL, SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 65 



and the white on the thi'oat and forepart of the neck, which are uniform with 

 the rest of the neck. 



117. Botaurus lbxtiginosus. This Bittern is occasionally met with about 

 the river banks, lagoons and swamps. Iris yellow ; feet grayish yellow; bill 

 yellowish green, blackish at the points. Length 26 inches, expanse 40, flex- 

 ure 12. Prevailing color brownish yellow, mottled and shaded darker with 

 reddish and brown and cinnamon brown ; a black stripe on each side of the 

 neck; chin and upper throat white, streaked with brown. I have not met 

 with the nest. 



114. Nyctiakdea gahjdkni. The Night Heron or Quok is often met with 

 about the lagoons and swamps. Length 25 to 30 inches, expanse 40 to 45, 

 flexure 12 to 13, bill and leg a little more than 3 inches. Iris red, orbits 

 green ; bill black ; legs and feet yellow, claws brown ; head, crest, scapulars 

 and back glossy metallic green ; long feathers of occipital crest forehead and 

 under parts white, passiug into pale slaty blue ; the wings and tail ashy blue. 

 The young differ in having the green of the upper parts replaced by dull 

 chocolate ; the coverts spotted white ; the neck and under parts streaked 

 with dusky: the quills tinged with reddish chocolate, and tipped whitish, 



120. Nyctherodius v-olaceus. The yellow-crowned Night Heron or Guinea- 

 hen Quok, is also of frequent occurrence. Dimensions rather less than the 

 preceding; the bill thicker and shorter. Iris reddish ; bill dark or blackish 

 green ; legs greenish yellow above, greenish black below ; the prevailing color 

 greyish leaden blue, lighter below ; top of the head and occipital feathers 

 yellowish white, surrounded with bluish black ; quills and tail dull lead co- 

 lor ; the young has the upper parts greenish olive, with central streaks and 

 terminal spots of brownish yellow; the under par's whitish, with yellowish 

 brown streaks. The night Herons build lower than the other species of Arde- 

 idce. The eggs of the two species are alike, rounded at both ends. 



TANTALlDsE. 



121. Ibis alba, the White Curlew. Ibis , the Black Curlew. The haunts 



of these two ( ? ) species of Ibis appear to be almost confined to the morass 

 borders of the. islets off Salt Island and Busiiy Park Lands, formed by the 

 growth of mangroves, and intersected by natural channels flowing between ; 

 the Curlews breed, and are so be found there at all seasons, only visiting the 

 mainland in August and sometimes in September. The first species is pure 

 white, with the first live wing quills tipped with greenish black. The 

 other is also white, with the head, neck, wings, and tail of a glossy greenish 

 black. The Hesh is equal to tha r . of the wild goose :; ' 



119. Ibis rubra. The red Curlew is a rare visitor on the south midland 

 coast ; but has been more frequently seen at the western end of the island. I 

 have never met with it. 



118. Platalea a.iaja. The roseate Spoonbill is of very rare occurrence. I 

 have only seen portions of oae, shot by Mr. M ixwell in Saint Elizabeth, many 

 years ago. f 



143. PHJENicoPTEEira ruber. The red Flamingo was formerly a frequent 

 visitor at the west end of the island, but rarely seen on the south midland or 

 eastern coast, t

Many species of Plovers and Snipes are regular annual visitors , they come 

 in considerable numbers with the autumnal rains, in the early part of Octo- 

 ber, (some are rather earlier in their advent.) and depart, many, before the 

 end of '.he year ; whilst others remain until February, or later in the succeed- 

 ing year. On the arrival of the migratory flocks in autumn, they ra-nge all 

 over the island where water is to be found. Some species are found during 

 the entire year, the number depending apparently on the signs of the coming 

 seasons ; during the dry summer of 1863 they were more abundant than in 

 18G1 or 1862 ; some of the summer residents breed in the high lands, but the 

 greater number of them are found on the plains and near the coast. 



CHARADRIIDsE. 



.ZEgialites melodus. The Piping Plover is, according to Gosse, an annual 

 visitor, but I have not met it in any of my collections. Mr. Gos.se m^y pos- 

 sibly have mistaken the following species for it. 



103, 260 yEftiALiTEs Waso?, T res. The Thick-billed Plover is easily recog- 

 nised by the bill ; it is one of tl.e permanent residents, and, I think, is more- 

 numerous during the summer than any of the other species of Aegialites ; the 

 migrants generally arrive in September, and depart in the early prat of the 

 following year, leaving, however, numbers widely distributed inland, as well 

 as on the coast. It lays on the bare sand like the Chordeil ', sometimes, but 

 not often, near the cover of some low shrub. J have not met with more than 

 three eggs in a nest; they are in form like the Quails, stone < oior, splashed 

 all over with small spots of bistre and vandyhe brown, and measuring 1.] by 1$. 

 SeVeral species of Ac< aiitcs are said to breed in Saint Elizabeth and West- 

 moreland. A. rod/ems and tcvuirostris may be among them.

 eggs, though they must certainly breed here, as one of my sons took from 

 one spot in July last, at Gieat Salt Pond, a broken egg perfectly shelled ; it 

 was dark grey apparently without, or with only minute dots.

 Fort, and in Sr. John, St. Thomas in the Vale, and on the bank of the Bio 

 Grande, near Mlllbank in Portland. The eggs are deposited on a few dried 

 leaves under low growing shrubs, (on the coast generally under the Surianvx

 with dark and light brown, and slat^y grey spots intermixed.

141. Himantopus NiQRicoiiLis -I have found the Stilt Plover about the 

 Salinas along the coast from Port Royal to Old Harbour, during; the entire 

 year; they are often seen about the Hashes made by the inroad of the Rio 

 Cobre at Passage Fort and the Salt Pans, and Salina at Hanson's or Great Salt 

 Pond, (and I make no doubt they breed throughout the- island.) The eggs 

 are generally found in a tussock of prass; from recollection they are stone 

 color, splashed all over with vandyke brown and pale bistre spots. 



Recurvirostka Americana. The American Avoset has been identified by 

 Mr. Hill ; it must be a rare visitor, as I have never met with it.

242, 255. Actodromas mixutilla. The little Sand-pipers are found at all 

 seasons, though tuost abundant in the late autumn and early winter months ; 

 they are not, however, uncommon during the spring and summer. They 

 breed on the Salinas and sandy beach, laying three or four eggs on the 

 bare sand ; these are yellowish, splashed with reddish brown and greyish 

 spots principally about the large end. I have had eggs from Great Salt Pond 

 and Passage Fort. 



129, 131. Calidris arenaria. The Sanderling is a regular annual visitor 

 I have a pair shot at Great Salt Pond on the 20th August, 1883.

 during the spring and summer. I have not met with the egg, though I am 

 sure it must breed here, as 1 have specimens of birds collected in April, Jane 

 and August of 1S63. 



130. Symphemia semipalmata. The Willet, known here as the Spanish 

 Plover, is not uncommon in some years during and after the autumnal rains. 

 1 have never seen it in summer, though it is said to breed in Saint Elizabeth. 



124. RaYACopuiLDS soutartus. The Solitary or Pond Snipe is never seen in 

 company a single bird or pair only is found usually about the cattle ponds. 

 The e.gs are laid on the bare ground. I have taken several nests, but have 

 no certain recollection of the eggs. 



128. Tringa canutus. The Knit or White-bellied Snipe is also found So 

 solitary loneliness on river banks, or marshy borders of ponds or fresh watiy 

 streams, at all seasons of the year, but I have not yet met with the eggs. 



127. Gallinago wilsoni. The Jack Snipe is common from the end of Sep 

 tember till December, and thence till April becomes almost solitary ; in the 

 la'ter months at early dawn, after a moonlight night, a single specimen is 

 sometimes found, on the dry pastures of salt ponds, mistaking, no doubt, for 

 water the glittering appearance caused by the moonlight on patches oi 

 parched, low grass. En some years they are abundant, in others scarce ; for 

 the last two or three years, 1861, 1862, 1863, they have been the latter in 

 the south midland plains, but have been abundant in the highlands. When 

 they first arrive they lie in considerable numbers along the borders of poradu, 

 or margins of marshy lands, in every part of the island. Many years ago. 

 early in October, in company with the late Captain St. John, then Island En- 

 gineer, we shot more than seventy brace in three days over a small Guinea 

 cornfield of about six acres; the land had been previously burnt off, and the 

 corn was then only a few inches high ; the water from the then recent heavy 

 rains lying in the intervals and in pud lies about the fidld, which adjoiaatj

 three Snipes are also annual visitors, arriving in considerable numbers in the 

 autumn, but I have not met with any during the summer. 



120. Numewius longikostris. The brown Curlew is often found in paire 

 among the mangrove swamps on the coast during the entire year, but more 

 frequently on the small sandy kays to the west of Healthshire and near Old 

 Harbour, where is also the common haunts of the two species of the Ibis. 

 They breed in the reeds, rushes and tall marsh grass on the borders of the 

 creeks and swamps; the eggs are four, larger at one end and obtusely pointed 

 at the other, measuring 2 yg by l}g ; they are greenish or olive green, with 

 blotches and splashes of dark umber and greenish brown.* 



There is another bird found in the mountain^, which I take to be a Curlew ; 

 it is much smaller than the preceding, and has a short bill ; the upper plu- 

 mage is also darker, and the under parts rusty white. It is prevalent in 

 the north eastern parishes, about the mountain streams. (Perhaps N. borc- 

 alis.) 



Iu November, 1826, I had a specimen of a Woodcock, shot on the race- 

 course near Spanish Town, but I have not since met with it. It was supposed 

 to be Philokela minor. I have only a slight recollection, and the following 

 note of it : Length not quite 12 inches ; wing rounded ; bill straight, enlarged 

 at the end; general color pale rufous, shaded ashy and darker rufous. 



RALLWsE. 



The Coot, in common with the two Gallinules, is found abundant in the 

 lagoons, marshes and ponds in all parts of the island, highlands as well a3 

 lowlands ; particularly where there is a thick growth of reeds, rushes and 

 water plants to afford them cover. The nidification of the three is very simi- 

 lar ; a platform of sticks, filled in and lined with decaying leaves, rushes, 

 water grass (ceratophyllum) and other water weeds, constructed in the tall 

 reeds and vegetable growth on the margin of the water. In the lagoons the 

 platform is often built on the interwoven roots of the black mangrove, and 

 composed principally of the decaying pods of the same tree ; they breed twice 

 and probably oftener in the year, commencing in March ; the eggs of all vary 

 considerably in size, but are pretty regular in form and measure, from 2 to 

 *?.\, by If to 1$ of an inch. (The flesh of all makes excellent game soup, if di- 

 vested of the skin, which, when left on, gives the dish a rank or fishy flavor).

140. Fitlica Americana. The Ivory-billed Coot lays from six to ei^li t or 

 more eggs, oval, pointed at one end, greyish stone color, splashed all over 

 with small bistre brown spits and dots ; the ground color, when first laid, is 

 very pale, but becomes darker by contact with the damp nest. 



139. GrALLiirr/LA g-aleata. The Scarlet-fronted or Florida Gallinule lays 

 five to eight eggs, at first clayish white, splashed sparsely with small spots of 

 sepia brown. By contact with the damp nest, the ground color of these eggs 

 often changes to different shades of drab. I have now, February, 18(54, un- 

 fledged young of this species in a pond near Spanish Town. 



210. Gallinula martinica. The Purple Gallinule, Sultana or Plantain 

 Coot, lays six to eight eggs, which are of a pale burnt sienna or yellowish 

 drab, splashed all over with small spots and dots of burnt umbre. * 



138. The Carpenter Coot is supposed to be the immature Plantain Coot; 

 but I am inclined to think that, on a more careful observation, it will be found 

 distinct ; the nestlings, so far as I have been able to examine them, are quite 

 different. 



133. Rallus elegans. The Mangrove, or Marsh Hen, is very common in 

 its usual haunt in the mangrove swamps. It is considered the highest game- 

 flavored bird in the island, and makes excellent game soup ; it builds a plat- 

 form of sticks, lined with softer mateiials, on low mangrove trees, sometimes 

 just on the surface of the water. I have never found more than two eggs in 

 any nest, but they are said to lay seven or eight ; the eggs are clear white, 

 measuring 1^ by 13-16ths. f 



Rallus ? violaceus. I have often seen this species in the ferry lagoon, but 

 never succeeded in procuring a specimen. The habits apprar to be very ?imi- 

 lar to those of the preceding. In February, 1863, Mr. Colchester obtained 

 one, a female, from the same locality. The dimensions and description given 



by the collector are, length 11| inches, expanse 15f ; bill If: middle t^e 1 -}- 

 The general plumage olive black, with olive brown wing coverts and 

 spotted all over with white ; iris red; bill pea green, orange at the b^ise ; 

 legs rosy pink ; gizzard muscular, and contained water snails with their 

 shel's. 



134. Rallus concolor, I have never found the Red Rail or Water Part- 

 ridge in the salt swamps, but always near fresh water at the foot of the hills, 

 or more commonly at the sedgy mountain ponds and streams. The eggs are 

 white, and rather smaller than those of the Mangrove Hen. 



135. Torzaxa Carolina. The common Rail is very variable in jdumngf) ; 

 it is found at all seasons and in all waters, fresh or salt. I have never met 

 with the eggs of this or either of the two next species. 



137. Porzana Jamaicensis. The Jamaica, or Little Black Rail, is also of fre- 

 quent occurrence about marshy lands, and on the savannahs and open pas- 

 tures in the vicinity of water. The cry of this species is chi chi-cro-croo-croo 

 several times repeated in sharp, high-toned notes, and heard at a considerable 



distance. 



136. Torzana minuta. This little Rail is not uncommon in the savannahs 

 and open pastures, and it has the same habits as the P. Jamaicensis ; but 1 

 have never heard it cry. The two last build in savannahs and open pasturee, 

 forming a chamber in a tussock of grass, with galleries on opposite sides.

 lence ( f the iridescent bronze, with the cerulean and purple, heirg the variation.

184. PoDiiYMBOS podiceps. The Black Gorget Grebe is often met with on 

 Rio Cobre in its entire course, and is sometimes, though rarely, seen on the 

 Cattle Ponds in the lowlands ; it, however, abounds in the highland lakes, 

 ponds and sedgy portions of mountain streams. 



1 have not had the same opportunities of observing the habits of this sppoies 

 aa I have had with the common Diver ; but their general habits and nidifica- 

 tion appear to be much alike. The nest of both species is a floating platform 

 or mass of sticks, leaves and water weeds 15 to 20 inches wide, and the same 

 m height, flattened at the top, with a slight depression in the middle, on 

 which three or four oval eggs are deposited. These are chalky white, with a 

 glaucous tinge beneath, though usually discolored by the damp materials of 

 the nest. The dimensions are \\ by ]. 



185. Podiceps dominictjs. The Diver frequents the ponds on the Cattle 

 Pens, in all parts of the island. The nest is similar in construction and ma- 

 terials, but rather smaller than that of the Grebe. The eggs are usually four, 

 oval, or oval-elongated, and measure \\ to If by rather less than an inch. 

 This species breeds from April to December, rearing several broods. Soon 

 after they are hatched, the young leave the nest and are carried about the 

 pond under the wings of the parent birds, where they are securely held in 

 swimming and diving. I once shot an old bird passing on the wing from one 

 pond to another, and found a young bird with it, which must have been 

 carried on its back. The same nest is used during the season, with slight ad- 

 ditions after each brood ; and is always pulled to pieces by the old birds when 

 they have done with it. 



AN AT I DAI. 



Ansee hyperboeeus and Beknicla canadensis are occasional visitors in con- 

 nection with a severe winter on the continent. 



144. Dekpeccygna abboeea. The Whistling Duck is a permanent resi- 

 dent, breeding in the lagoons and morasses on mangrove stools and in clumps 

 of reeds and rushes, laying ten or twelve eggs. It is easily domesticated, 

 but it is necessary to take off the first pinion of one wing to prevent it join- 

 ing the passing wild flocks. They breed more than once during the year, as 

 numbers of them are taken before they become fully fledged, and brought 

 into the towns for sale from May to December. In lb?4 and 1835, at a pen 

 on the St. John's Road, where there is a large pond, some Whistling Ducks 

 were kept among the domestic poultry ; they frequently brought into the 

 poultry yard, in the early dawn, small parties of the Wild Duck, which ac- 

 companied the tame ones without any shyness or alarm into the poultry 

 house, and were thus secured. They feed by night as well as by day. Their 

 whistling cry is often heard passing over head at night. I have frequently, 

 on moonlight, nights in January and Febiuary, shot them in numbers, 

 whilst feeding in the guinea cornfields.

 recollection of them is too uncertain to venture upon their description. 



145. Dekdeocygna ad'tumnalis. I have been told that the Red-legged 

 "Whistling Duck is sometimes met with in some of the eastern parishes, but 

 I have never met with any others than those imported into Kingston from the 

 Spanish Main ; and I have not seen any of these for several years. 



146. Anas maxima. The Green-back Mallard, whether a hybrid or a va- 

 riety of A. boschas, is apparently apeimanent resident in the island, almost 

 restricted to the deep recesses of the morasses and lagoons at the west end of 

 the island. 1 have never seen a specimtu of this duck, hut '.here have been

several well authenticated specimens of it, besides Grosse's and those referred to 

 by Robinson, obtained, however, from the same vicinage.* In the summer of 

 1863, a nest of eleven eggs taken from a platform of rushes floating in the 

 large lake at Rio llio near Walton, in the Moneague District of St. Ann's, 

 were brought to the Rev. Mr. Mais, master of Walton School. These eggs 

 are supposed to belong to the Millard ; th'y are oily white, and measure 2| 

 by ]| of an inch. 



Many years ago I saw some eggs supposed to be one of the large migratory 

 lucks ; they were taken from the lake near Dry Harbor ; they were yellowish 

 oily green, very like some eggs of the English Duck, but I could not obtain 

 any information respecting them ; they may have belonged to the Shoveller,! 

 which I was toll had been found in those waters during the same summer ; 

 or, possibly, an English Duck from Dry Harbor, or one of the neighboring 

 pens. 



148. QgERQUEDULA inqrnata. The plain Blue-winged Teal is also a per- 

 manent inhabitant of Jamaica, breeding in the interior lagoons and morasses. 

 It is, I think, unite distinct from Q. dixcors. During the months of May and 

 June individuals are sometimes shot at the Cattle Ponds in the lowlands, but 

 they come down in September in flocks of considerable numbers, and are 

 common a month or more before the arrival of the Lunate Teal ; and in no 

 instance have I ever seen or heard of a specimen with the white crescent 

 having been found here in the summer, or previous to the month of Novem- 

 ber. The eggs are bluish chalky white. 



147. CJuerquedula DisfcORS. I have never seen the Lunate Blue-wing 

 earlier than the month of November; the usual period of their arrival is 

 towards the end of the month, and they again appear in March and April on 

 their return to the continent, when they are usually in full summer livery.

"(N'ote by Mr. Richard Hill.) In the October season of 18i>5 there hail been wild, stormy rains. 

 The win. Is had bl >wo from tlu west wish that broad, steady force which renders our tempests in 

 tlio latter season as fierce as hurricanes, th >ugh not rotatory storms ; prodigious numbers of ducks 

 were blown before the winds from the c intiuent to tin: islands, that is. from the Mexican Uulf to- 

 t.ne Carribean Sea. The birds arrived at the west end of Jamaica so exhausted and beaten by the 

 rain that iu attempting to alight they fell, and many were picked up in the streets of Montego 

 Hay. Among several ducks that reached our garden just out of the town, was what seemed a. 

 Mallard of extraordinary size. In bulk of b.idy it appeared as large as a Muscovy Duck, {Giirina 

 moschala.) but its shape wot essentially a Mallard, (Greets bosdias.) It was taken up helpless 

 from fatigue, Teal hid been taken up at the saiua time in the same state of exhaustion. My 

 sister, Mrs. Clemetson, caged tlie extraordinary duck, and had it for two seasons. It was a 

 female. J saw it in the spring of 1817, and diiectei that it should be shipped to London for the 

 Zoological Society. Before it c >uld be di,-patched, it died in full plumare, and lull flesh. It had 

 laid infertile egs^s in the previous spring, an I was again laying infertile eggs, the sexual instinct 

 beinc intensely strong; and something like uterine inflammation, if we may so speak, had super- 

 v ened, and the bird perished iu the at of egg-laying. The duck exactly resembled in plumage

 mongrels are held in higher estimation, as the young have the advantage of 

 arriving at maturity much earlier than those of either parent, and are con- 

 sidered of superior flavor to either, particularly when raised on the duck ant 

 and guinea corn. 



Note by Mr. Hill. The habitat of the Muscovy Duck is the Lake of Nica- 

 ragua. There all travellers see them at all times, either in small breeding 

 coteries or large flocks. In the wild state their plumage is dark without any 

 admixture of white. They were originally procured from the Mosquito shore. 

 the country of the Muysca Indians, (see Humboldt's researches,) and hence 

 is derived the name of Musco Duck, corrupted into Muscovy Duck. The 

 West Indian Islanders had early naturalized them, for, on the discovery of 

 Columbus, they speak of " ducks as large as geese," that they found among 

 the Indians. 



A critical Review of the Family PROd-LLARIBiE : Part I., embracing the 

 PRUCELLARIES, or Stormy Petrels. 



(Based principally on specimens in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.) 



BY ELLIOTT COUE3, M. D. 



Having occasion to publish descriptions of several new species of Pro- 

 cellaridae. which I find in the museum of the Smithsonian Institution, the 

 present seems a fitting opportunity to embody in a review of the family the 

 results arrived at in an investigation in which I have been for some time 

 engaged. The present paper is the first of a series in which will be con- 

 sidered the entire family. It embraces the section Procellarieae, an interest- 

 ing and somewhat extensive group of which the common " Mother Carey's 

 Chicken" Prooellaria pelagiea may be considered as typical. I have at- 

 tempted to elucidate the specific characters of the components of the group, 

 as well as their most natural generic disposition ; and to discuss fairly such 

 questions of synonymy as may arise. It will be perceived that in my generic 

 arrangement, I have closely followed Prince C. L. Bonaparte, whose ideas of a 

 genus, as set forth in his later writings, agree most nearly with my own. I have 

 derived most assistance, as regards specific characters, from tin very valuable 

 monograph recently published by Dr. II. Schlegel, though of course it is 

 quite impossible for me to agree with him on any points of systematic 



[March 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. <3 



arrangement and nomenclature. A comparison of the respective mono- 

 graphs on this subject, by the two distinguished authors just mentioned, 

 affords a striking illustration of the widely diverse results which may be 

 arrived at on any investigation, when two co-workers entertain radically 

 opposite views concerning generic or specific relations. The endeavor to 

 harmonize such conflicting opinions is a matter of no little difficulty ; but 

 as the truth probably lies somewhere between the two, it is perhaps worth 

 while to make the attempt. With every facility in the way of books and 

 specimens which the Philadelphia Academy and the Smithsonian Institution 

 afford, I may perhaps have been so fortunate as to have fixed the quite 

 numerous species with some degree of precision, and to have settled some 

 points of synonymy. Concerning the genera adopted, each one must judge 

 of their agreement with nature, or the reverse, according to his own opinion 

 upon the question of what constitutes a generic group. 



The family Procellaridse is naturally divisible into three subfamilies : the 

 Diomedeinse, the Procellarina^, and the Halodrominse. These are readily 

 eharacterizable, aside from any consideration of other features, by the posi- 

 tion and shape of the nasal tubes. In the Diornedeina? these tubes are 

 entirely disconnected, and placed one on each side of the bill. In the Pro- 

 cellarinse they are united, situated at the base of the culmen, and open more 

 or less horizontally forwards. In the Halodrominas their position is as in 

 the Procellarina?, but their apertures are directed vertically upwards. 



The subfamily Procellarinae is composed of several grpups, or assemblages 

 of genera and species, which constitute the "sections" of Prince Bonaparte's 

 arrangements. These divisions are the Fulmarese, the Daptionea?, the Prio- 

 neae, the Puffinea?, and the Procellarieae. The genera composing each of 

 these are more intimately allied to each other than they are to the genera of 

 any other section : and we have consequently an exceedingly convenient and 

 perhaps not unnatural means of dividing the very- extensive subfamily into 

 readily characterizable lesser groups. That section which forms the subject 

 of the present article the Procellariea; is the largest and at the same time 

 the most marked of these groups. It may readily be distinguished from the 

 other groups by the following peculiarities : 



Section PHOCELLAR1EJE. 



The species are all uniformly of small size, there being found in this 

 section the very smallest of natatores, and none of the species exceeding 

 eight or nine inches in total length. In form, most of the genera are delicate 

 and graceful, none being as robust as is usual in most of the genera of other 

 sections. The colors of the group vary exceedingly. A large proportion of 

 the species are fuliginous black, varied more or less with white; but in some 

 genera there is seen some variety in the pattern of coloration. Bright 

 colors, however, are never found. The bill is of moderate or very small 

 size, always shorter than the head or tarsus, rather wide at the base, its sides 

 rapidly converging towards an attenuated compressed decurved tip. The 

 nafal tubes are long, elevated, and conspicuous ; subcylindrical in shape, 

 inclined forwards and somewhat obliquely upwards ; the septum between the 

 narcs thin, delicate, and quite perpendicular; the nasal aperture circular; 

 the tubes in length always at least nearly half as long as the culmen. The 

 wings are long; the first primary, contrary to the general rule in this family, 

 always shorter than the second, sometimes only as long as the fourth. The 

 second primary is always longest, the third intermediate between the fourth 

 aud second. The primaries are acutely pointed, a little falcate, and strong, 

 though very flexible and elastic. The tail is very long, but is exceedingly 

 variable in shape, being even, forked, emarginate, rounded, or cuneate. The 

 legs are ; !y slender, delicate, compressed usually, much elongated. 



1864.] 




74 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



The tibiae are denuded for some portion of their length. The tarsal scutel- 

 Ise are usually distinct, though fused in one genus. The toes are very long 

 and slender, the outer nearly or quite as long as the middle, the inner con- 

 siderably shorter. The hallux is exceedingly minute, almost rudimental in 

 character, having a short, straight, acute claw. The interdigital membranes 

 are rather narrow, but extend-quite to the claws. 



In examining collectively the species of the section thus characterized, we 

 find that they arrange themselves very naturally into two very trenchantly 

 defined groups. In the first of these, the legs are short ; the tibiae almost 

 wholly feathered; the tarsus scarcely longer than the middle toe; the claws 

 small, compressed and acute ; the colors uniformly dark, or only relieved by 

 white on the rump and crissum. In the second of these groups, the species 

 all stand high, the legs being unusually elongated ; the tibiae are naked for an 

 inch or more ; the tarsi are very much longer than the middle toe and claw; 

 the claws are all broad, depressed, obtuse, rounded. The tail is rounded or 

 forked : never cuieate. 



i. The first of these groups is composed of four genera :Occanodroma 

 (type Proc. furcala, Gm ), comprehending two species; Cy ><(. Mini, 



equal to Thalassidroma of authors, containing some four or five species : Ualo- 

 cyplena, Mini, a hitherto unknown genus, with a single species ; and Procel- 

 laria of Linnreus (as restricted by Bonaparte), whose type is the P. pelagica, 

 and which comprised several species closely allied to the last named. 



. The second grpup is represented by three genera: Oceanites of Keyser- 

 ling and Blasius, with Thai. Wilsoni of Bonaparte as type, and comprising 

 besides its type three other species; Fregetta, Bonaparte, comprising some 

 four species congeneric with tropica of Gould, and Pelagodroma, whose type 

 aud single species is the Procellaria fregata of Linnasus. 



I shall review these genera and their respective species in the order in 

 which they are mentioned above, discussing the various questions concerning 

 which there exists doubt or confusion, and then present a synopsis of the 

 whole subject, in accordance with the results which may be by this means 

 arrived at. 



?i I. OCEANODROMA, Reichenbach. 



This genus was founded by Prof. Reichenbach upon the old Procellaria 

 furcala of Gmclin. Its distinctive characters lie in its small, much com- 

 pressed, rather weak bill; in its comparatively very short wings, of which 

 the first primary is unusually abbreTiated, (being intermediate between the 

 fourth aud fifth), while the third is fully as long as the second : in its very 

 long, deeply-forked tail, with its broad central aud attenuated exterior 

 rectrices. In the proportions of the naked space of the tibia?, and of the 

 tarsus and toes it does not differ from several other genera of the section. 

 The middle toe with the claw is about as long as the tarsus. The colors are 

 peculiar, and only found in this ger.us. 



Two species of the genus are knowm to exist; both inhabiting the North 

 Pacific Ocean.

2. OCEANODftOMA HoRNBYI, Bp. ex Gray. 



This, the second species of the genus, was first introduced by Gr. 11. Gray, 

 in the proceedings of the Z tological Society for 1853, p. 62, under the name 

 of Thalassidroma Hornby:. Judging from Mr. Gray's descriptions -for I am 

 autoptically unacquainted with the species it is entirely congeneric with 

 the 0. furcata, though differing greatly from it in colors. This generic dis- 

 position has been made by Bonaparte, on page 195 of the second volume of 

 his Conspectus. It appears as yet to be an exceedingly rare bird in col- 

 lections : none are contained in the Philadelphia Academy or Smithsonian 

 Institution, or, in fact, so far as I am aware, in any American collection. It 

 uas the front, cheeks, throat, collar round the neck, breast, and abdomen pure 

 white; crown, hind head, a broad band in front of neck, bend of wing- and 

 lesser wing coverts sooty gray : upper part of back gray ; lower part of back 

 and tail ashy gray; greater wing- coverts brownish gray; tertiaries and quills

I II. CYMOCHUREA, Coues. 



This, the second genus: of the short-legged acute-clawed group of 

 Procellariea; is most nearly allied to Oceanodroma, having like it a loug 

 deeply-forked tail. It is the genus of which the well known Leach's Petrel 

 is typical; and one to which Melania, Bonaparte, and a new species, about to 

 be described, also belong. With the forked tail and short legs of Oceanodroma, 

 it is distinguished from that genus by its comparatively very much longer 

 wings ; by its larger, longer, much more robust bill, with shorter and 

 straighter nasal tubules : by its radically different pattern of coloration, &c. 



The name ' Thalassidroma" is the one under which this genus is generally 

 presented. Founded by Vigors in 1825, upon the Procellaria pelagica, Lin- 

 nasus, the name has been employed by ornithologists, in a most unaccount- 

 ably loose and vague way, to designate any and all the species of Procellariea;, 

 without the slightest regard to their natural generic affinities. In 1856, 

 Bonaparte first restricted Thalassidroma to a single genus, that one of which 

 Leachii, Temminck, is the type. But if used at all, it must be, of course, for 

 that genus of birds upon which it was founded, viz., the one of which 

 pelagica is the type; for it is contrary to all rule to use a synonym of one 

 genus as the tenable name of another. As will be demonstrated further on, 

 u _ Thalassidroma., Vigors, ' : is a complete synonym of Procellaria proper of Lin- 

 !ia3us, as is also //./.. of Boie, both being based upon the P. pelagica, 



Linnaeus. This being the case, it is evident that the present well known 

 genus has yet to receive a tenable distinctive appellation. 



In supplying a name, I take Leachii, Temm., or rather leucorrhoa, Vieill., as 

 my type; and in the following diagnosis so define the genus as to exclude all 

 forms not entirely congeneric with it. 



Cgmochorea,* Coues. {=Thalassidroma, Bp. nee Vigor.,. Type Procellaria leu- 

 corrhoa, Vieill.) Bill much shorter than^he head, about two-thirds the tarsus, or 

 middle toe with the claw, rather stout, as high or higher than broad at the 

 base, the unguis strong, much decurved; the nasal tubes less than half as long 

 as the culmen. Wings moderately long, not much surpassing the tail when 

 folded; first primary longer than the fourth, second longest. Tail exceed- 

 ingly long, deeply forked, the feathers all broad, their tips obtusely rounded. 

 Legs short; bare space of tibias brief. Tarsus equal to middle toe and claw. 

 of rather large size, and stout form. Colors unicolor, or nearly so. 



Three species are at present known to constitute this genus. These are 

 the following :

76 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY CF 



1. Cymochorea leucorrhoa, Coues ex Viciliot. 



The specific characters of this, the common and abundant " Leach's Petrel," 

 being so well known, need not detain us. Its synonymy, however, is suffi- 

 ciently extensive and complicated to require attention. 



There can be no doubt, I think, that the Procellaria leucorrhoa, Vieillot, 

 Nouveau Dictionaire d'lfistoire Naturelle, tome xxv. 1817, page 422, was 

 based upon this species. Vieillot's description is : " Sept pouces et rtemi de 

 longueur totale ; la queue fourchue ; le bee, les pieds, les pennes alavies et 

 caudales, noires ; la reste du plumage couleur de suie, a l'exception des cou- 

 vertures superieures de la queue qui sont blanches, et d'un lisere gris-blanc 

 qui est a Pextremite' des pennes secondares de l'aile." Our author further 

 remarks that this Petrel " se tient sur 1'ocean" Atlantic "jusqu'au Brazil, 

 et peutetre encore au dela." In every respect the description so clearly and 

 completely applies to the present species, that no argument is needed to prove 

 the propriety of the reference. 



The next notice of the species that I have met with is by Temminck, Man- 

 uel d'ornithologie, 1820, ii. page 812, under the name of Procellaria Leachii. 

 The description is pertinent and complete, and the indication of the species 

 so unmistakeable, that the name Leachii has always remained the one in 

 common employ among ornithologists. 



In 1828, Dr. Fleming, in his '-History of British Animals," page 136, de- 

 scribes this species under the name of Procellaria Bulk kh. 



The citation " Procellaria pelayica, Pallas nee Linnams," is given by Bona- 

 parte as refering to this species. From what is now known of the range of 

 habitat of the latter, it would seem at best but a doubtful citation. 



In addition to the above, the species has been placed in numerous genera. 

 It is the Thalassidroma Leachii of Bonaparte. Consp. av. ii. 195; the Thalassi- 

 droma BullocMi of Selby, Ornith. ii. page 537: and the llydrobales Leachii ol

2. Cymochorea. melania, Coues ex Bonap. 



This, the second species of the genus, was first introduced by Bonn parte in fa is 

 Not. Orn. Delattr. in the Compt. Rend. 1 854, xxviii. p. 602. under the name of 

 Procellaria melania. The following is his diagnosis. " Nigro-coracina, vel in uro- 

 pygio ; subtus fuliginosa ; alis longissimis ; cauda brevi, sed profundi furcata ; 

 tectricibus omnibus omnino nigris." Unfortunately, however, as it afterwards 

 proved, he neglected to give any measurements; as a consequence, the suc- 

 ceeding species, homochroa. about to be described, has appeared in the ix. vol. 

 of thePacine Railroad Reports as the true melania, when it is in reality a 

 very different bird, though, like melania, it wants a white rump. Prof. Baird 

 has been enabled to obtain fromM. Pucheran the measurements of the true 

 melania, and these agree perfectly with a skin in the Smithsonian from Cape 

 St. Lucas, Lower California. As the species is yet rare in collections, and 

 one with which comparatively few ornithologists are autoptically ac- 

 quainted, a full description, taken from a typical example now before me, 

 niav not be out of place here. 



Form. The bill is large and robust, the mandibular rami of the intermaxil- 

 lary especially strong and prominent. The nasal tubes, as in T. Leachii, 

 measure a little less than half the length of bill. The bill is about two-thirds 

 the length of the skull ; about half that of the tarsus. The wings are mod- 

 erately long for this group, reaching only a little beyond the tail. The point 

 of the wing' is formed by the second primary alone; the third being interme- 

 diate between the second and the first; and the first intermediate between the 

 third and fourth. The tail seems rather long for this group and is deeply 

 forked, all the rcctrices being quite broad to their obtusely rounded tips. 

 The tibia is bare for a longer space than is that of T. Leachii. The legs are 

 short The tarsi are slightly longer than the middle toe and claw. The outer 



[Mar. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 77 



toe alone is absolutely longer than the middle one, but its claw is much 

 smaller. The apex of the inner claw reaches to the base of the middle one. 



Colors. The entire plumage is of a deep sooty brownish black, deepest on 

 the sides of the head about the eyes and on the upper parts generally, in- 

 cluding the rump, changing gradually to a lighter, more fuliginous and more 

 brownish black on the belly, under tail coverts and crissum. The major 

 alar tectrices are lighter than the rest of the plumage, though not very con- 

 spicuously so. The remiges and rectrices are wholly pure black, as are the 

 bill, feet, claws and interdigital membranes. Iris light brown. 



Dimensions. Length 1) 00 inches, extent of wings 18-50 (on authority of 

 collector's label). Bill along culmen -GO, along rictus -95 ; height at base -25. 

 width -25 ; length of nasal tubes -30. Wing from the carpal joint G-70. Tail 

 external feather 3 90, internal 2-70, depth of fork 1-20. Tibiie bare -50 ; tarsus 

 1 20, the middle toe and claw 1-10, (inches and hundredths.) 



(Description from No. 13,025, Smithsonian Register tf ; Cape St. Lucas, 

 Lower California. J. Xantus.) 



It is somewhat a question whether this species be not the Procellaria fuliffi- 

 nosa of Latham, lad. Orn. ii. 1790, p. 825. The following is his diagnosis : 

 " Pr. fuliginoso-fusca, capite, collo, remigibus rectricibusque nigris cauda 

 emarginata. * * * Habitat in insula Otaheitc ; prsecedentis* magnitudine." 



This description applies pretty well, but the dimensions are far too large, 

 the preceding species desolata being described as eleven inches in length. 

 This same " Procellaria fuliginosa, Lath.,"' is more fully described by Vieillot, 

 Nouv. Diet. d'Hist. Nat. xxv. p. 418, (1817,) under the name of " Petrel fuligi- 

 neux d'Otaiti." Vieillot's description, however, only applies approximately. 

 The species is there said to be " dix pouces" long ; to have the tail only "un 

 pen fourchue ;" and it is stated that the interdigital membrane "a des taches 

 jaunes ga et la." In view of the uncertainty, I do not see any cause to super- 

 sede Bonaparte's name. 



I am unable to discuss the relationships of a certain " Procellaria scapulata^ 

 Brandt," referred with a query to this species by Bonaparte. 



The third species of the genus is the one already adverted to, as that 

 one figured and described in the Birds of North America, under the name 

 and with the synonymy of the melania, Bp.

Petrel not very unlike T. melania, but much smaller, with a short, light, much 

 compressed bill, and the tarsus equal to the middle toe and claw. General 

 color a dull plumbeous or slat}- black, growing more or less fuliginous on 

 the abdomen; the crissum and rump concolor with the rest of the plumage; 

 the wings and tail dull black, the greater wing coverts light greyish brown. 



Habitat. Farallone Islands, Pacific coast of North America. 



Form The bill of this species is not quite half as long as the skull, rather 

 more than half the length of the quite short tarsus, is much compressed and 

 not very robust. The folded wings reach a little beyond the tail. The second 

 primary is a little the longest, the third is nearly equal, the first considerably 

 longer than the fourth. The tail is of about the same comparative length as in 

 Leachii or melania ; the depth of the fork being as great as in the latter species.

78 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



The tarsi are comparatively a little shorter than in this species, bcin j., nc 

 longer than the toe and claw. 



Color. The plumage, although agreeing with that of melania in its gem 

 characters, < f its uniformity and the want of a white ramp < r erissum, etc , 

 is yet quite different in tint, being of a deci mbeous or dull de< p blue- 



ish black, rather than the smoky brownish black oi m . Indeed the tint 

 calls faintly to mind the plumage of Jurcata. This plumbeous tint is most 

 palpable on the head and upper part of the back ; it deepens about the eye so 

 as to almost form an anteocular spot ; and on the breast gradually change? 

 to more of a fuliginous hue, which prevails over the whole abdomen and 

 under tail coverts. The color of the wings and tail is not different from that 

 which obtains with nearly all the species of the section, and there is also the 

 same dull greyish brown band along the greater coverts, and invading the 

 outer edges of most of the tertials, as well as their apices. A further character 

 of the species, wherein its coloration differs from that of melania, is found in 

 the inferior alar tectrices, and axillary feathers, many of which are wholly 

 or in part dull whitish. The feet are wholly black. 



Independently of any differences in plumage the following measurements, 

 compared with those already given of the melania, serve at once to separate 

 the two species : 



Dimensions. Length (approximately correct only) V-25 inches. Wing, 

 from the carpal joint, 5-00 or a little more. Bill, along culmen, -50 ; along 

 rictus '75 ; height at base -21 ; width -20; length of nasal tubes -24. Tarsus 

 90; middle toe and claw about the same. Tail outer feather 3-25; 

 inner 2-G0. 



Three fine specimens of this interesting species are in the Smithsonian 

 Museum, all procured at the Farallone Islands, Pacific, coast of North 

 America, i have taken No. 21,444 as the type of 7iiy species. No. 13,725, 

 received from Mr. F. Gruber, is the original of the figure of " Melania, Bp.," 

 given in the atlas of the general report. All three are quite identical in 

 every respect. 



III. HALOCYPTENA * Coues, nov. gen. 



The third genus of the group is one as yet undescribed, and which I have 

 now the pleasure of introducing to the notice of ornithologists. It differs 

 most remarkably from all other genera of the Procellariae in the possession 

 of a enneate tail. In most other respects it comes nearest to Procellaria 

 proper, with pelagiea as type; but it nevertheless differs from that genus ic 

 addition to the peculiar shape of its tail, in its exceedingly long and acute 

 wings. The fqllowing are its diagnostic characters. 



Char. Gen. Bill much shorter than the head, about half the tarsus, weak, 

 slender, compressed, the convexity of the culmen beyond the nostrils very 

 great. Nasal tubes as in other Procellariese. Wings very long, reaching 

 much beyond the tail, acutely pointed ; second primary longest, third nearly 

 equal, first about as long as the fourth. Tibice naked for a very short space. 

 Tarsus a little longer than the middle toe or claw. Outer toe without claw, 

 absolutely as long as the middle ; but its claw very short and weak. Tip of 

 inner claw reaching to the base of the middle one. Hallux exceedingly 

 minute. Webs moderately full ; their margins incised. Claws compressed, 

 curved, acute. Tail rather long, wedge-shaped ; the central rectrices pro- 

 jecting somewhat beyond the rest; the lateral all regularly graduated ; the 

 tips of all narrow, acutely rounded. Unicolor; of very small size, and ex- 

 ceedingly deli, ate form. 



The only known species of the genus is the following :

 wards including the under tail coverts. The lesser and medium wing 

 coverts are as dark as the back; as are also the inferior alar tectrices. The 

 greater coverts are considerably lighter ; being with the external borders of 

 some of the tertials dull brownish, with a cast of gray. The remiges and

This diminutive species hardly exceeds in size the little G. pelagiea, and is 

 at the same time much slenderer and more delicate in form than that species. 

 The combination of the small size; peculiar form and unifi rm < dors widely 

 separate it from any ether known Petri 1. 



I IV. PROCELLARIA, Linn, emend. 



The genus of which the little pelagiea L. is the type constitutes the fifth 

 and the last one of this short-legged group of Procellariese. It is readily 

 recognizable among all its allies by the combination of its short legs, acui" 

 claws, and square or slightly rounded tail. As to size, it comprehends the 

 very smallest of known natatores ; with hardly the exception of my diminu- 

 tive little Halocyptcna mkrosoma. The bill is small, short compressed, th< 

 sides rapidly converging to the narrow tip ; less than half as long as tb.v 

 skull, a little more than half the tarsus. The wings in length an typical of 

 the section ; reaching beyond the tail. The second primary is longest ; the 

 third a little shorter; the first less than the fourth. The bare proportion of 

 the tibia? is short ; the tarsus is just equal to the middl i toe and claw. The 

 proportions of the toes to each other are as in other genera, already described. 

 The tail is moderately long, full, the feathers broad; > little rounded in 

 shape. In color this genus is usually dark with a white rump and crissum ; 

 though this color does not obtain throughout the genus, if such species as 

 nereis, Gould, and fasciolat a, Tschudi, really belong here. 



The genus I'rocellarid first appears in 1746, in the sixth edition of the Sys- 

 temne Naturae, having as its type the P . pelagiea, Linnaius. Throughout suc- 

 cessive editi -. the same species is invariably made tj ' \ \ : as it also is in 

 the Edition of Gmelin (1788), and in Latham's Index Ornithologicus (1790). 

 I am, therefore, quite at a loss to discover the grounds upon which modern 

 ornithologists have been justifiable in assigning the name Procellaria to such 

 a genus e. g. as that of which glacialis, or antarcticus, or ( oki, are respectively 

 typical. If with Dr. Schlegel we admit but a single genus of Procellarinse, 

 that' will of course be Procellaria; and we shall employ it in its original Lin- 

 nean acceptation. If, however, with almost all ornithologists, we make .

family Pro cell aridce of Linnaeus' genus Procellaria, and proceed to separate 

 the component genera according to the now generally received definition of 

 a "genus ;" then Procellaria must be restricted to pelagica and its congeners, 

 and other names be found for the remaining generic groups ; there are few 

 points of synonymy, involving a Linnean name, more clearly demonstrated 

 than this. 



The first synonym of Procellaria that I have met with is Hydrobales, Boie, 

 Isis Von Oken, 1822, p. 5G2. This has pelagica as its type. This is not, 

 however, to be confounded with Hydrobata, Vieillot, 1816, wilich is a genus 

 of Turdida;, with Slurnus cinclus, L. as type. 



The second synonym of the genus is Thallassidroma, Vigors, Zoological 

 Journal, Vol. ii. for October. 1825, page 405. Although based upon pelagica, 

 and therefore an entire synonym of Procellaria, Linn., this name has become 

 most firmly established, not only as an appellation for this genus, but also 

 for all the Stormy Petrels indiscriminate^'. It will be evident, I hope, from 

 what has just been said, that not only is the name quite untenable for the 

 present genus, but that it cannot be used with propriety in any connection. 



The number of species composing this genus is a little uncertain ; partly 

 in consequence of unusual variations to which pelagic i seems subject; and 

 partly because the indications of many comparatively recently described 

 species are not explicit enough as regards proportions, etc., to admit of a 

 definite reference to their proper genus. I will first notice pelagica and its 

 kindred species, and then consider those species which seem to fall most 

 laturally in this genus.

Syst. Nat. ed. vi., 1746 ; nee. Wils. Amer. Ornith. vii. p. 90. Hgdrobatet

 ii., 1825, p. 405, et auctoruru fere omnium post. A. D. MDCCCXXV. Above 

 glossy brownish black, below more fuliginous the under tail coverts, however, 

 of the former color, and very long, reaching sometimes to bej'ond the tips of 

 the rectrices themselves. The superior caudal tectrices are pure white, ter- 

 minated, however, with equally well defined black tip3. The white of the 

 crissum is less pure and well defined; and that of the under tail coverts is 

 much interrupted with blackish. The inferior alar tectrices and the axillary 

 feathers are variegated with light touches of dull white. 



This species apparently varies to an unusual extent in size, especially ae 

 regards length of wing. Specimens before me measure about 4.} inches from 

 the carpal joint. Dr. Schlegel says, " aile 4 pouces a 4 pouces 6 lignes." 

 Mr. Lawrence says " wing five inches." These variations, and doubtless cor- 

 responding discrepancies in other dimensions, have been the cause of the 

 founding of several species ; either entirely nominal, or at most constituting 

 races of the same parent stock. Omitting entirely to notice Brehm's multi- 

 farious "species" [sic!] those most entitled to consideration are the fol- 

 lowing :

 ii., 1856, p. 197. From the Gallapagos Islands. This typical Procellaria 

 is exceedingly closely allied to pelagica ; but differs from it in wanting the 

 black tips of the superior caudal tectrices, which are always found in the 

 latter. It is also said to be somewhat smaller, and to have less markedly 

 the transalar fascia. 

 ? 3. Procellaria luodbris, Natterer. 



Acta Ital. Medio!., 1844. "Ex oceano Mcred." This species (if it be really 

 one), differs from the typical pelagica in being somewhat larger, and in having 

 a more robust bill. It would appear also that there is less of whitish upon 

 either surface of the wing, and upon the under tail coverts. The upper tail 



[Murch 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 81 



coverts have the same black tips. Without a typical example professing to 

 be this species, I am unable to decide definitely concerning it, but I am much 

 inclined to doubt its validity. 



?4. Procellaria melitensis, Schembri. 



" Thalassidroma melitensis, Schembri, Catal. Ornith. del. Grupp. di Malta, p. 

 118." This is a species placed by Bonaparte as a synonym of a pelagica, but 

 by Gray considered as distinct. I have no means of judging of its validity. 

 The name is employed by Reichenbach to designate the true pelagica. 



5. Procellaria nereis, Bp. ex Gould. 



Thalassidroma nereis, Gould, Proc. Zool. Soc, Lond., 1840, viii. p. 178. 

 Procellaria nereis, Bp. Consp. Avium, 1856, ii. p. 196. 



I have had the pleasure of examining Mr. Gould's types of this species from 

 Bass' Straits, Australia, now in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy. 

 It is a beautiful little species, quite unlike any other known Stormy Petrel. 

 In form it comes nearer to Procellaria pelagica than to any other species, and 

 it is probably congeneric with it, though it differs somewhat in the propor- 

 tions of the tarsus and toes, and very widely in its pattern of coloration. 



The bill is very small, short, and compressed. The wings reach just 

 beyond the tail ; the second primary is the longest; the third and first nearly 

 equal ; the fourth much shorter. The tail is long, slightly rounded ; the rec- 

 trices broad to their very tips. The tibias are denuded for from half to two- 

 thirds of an inch. The proportions of the tarsus and toes differ from those 

 of pelagica, in the greater comparative length of the former. 



The bill, legs, and feet are black. The head all round, the upper part of 

 the neck and the nape are fuliginous brown with a cinereous hue. This 

 bluish ashen tint becomes the prevailing color on the lower part of the back, 

 the wing and tail coverts, and the tertials ; these feathers being edged more 

 or less conspicuously with grayish white. The primaries are brownish black, 

 lighter on their inner webs, the more inner ones with an ashen tinge. The 

 caudal rectrices are light ashen blue, gradually deepening towards their tips 

 into pure black. The entire under parts from the breast backwards, and the 

 under surfaces of the wings, except just along their edges, are pure white. 

 There are a few longitudinal shaft lines of bluish gray on the sides and 

 crissum, which became still more obvious on the under tail coverts. 

 This species inhabits the Australian seas. 



7. Procellaria fasciolata, Coues ex Tsch. 



Thalassidroma fasciolata, Tschudi, Beitrage zur Geographischen Verbreitung 

 der Meeresvogel in Cabanis' Journ. f. Ornith. iv., May, 1856, p. 180. From 

 the Aurora Islands. " Sein Kopf ist schwarz, der Mantel rost braun, die 

 untere Seite der Flugel mattschwarz, die obere wie der Mantel. Vom Rucken 

 aber bis zur Wurzel der ersten Schwungfedern verlauft ein Zoll breiter 

 weisslich-brauner Streif. Der Bauch ist tiefschwarz, der Steiss schneweiss. 

 Der Schwanz ist schwarz, fiicherformig, schwach halbmondformig ausges- 

 chweift. Schnabel und Fiisse sind schwarz, die schwimmhaut sehr weit, die 

 Iris tief schwarzbraun. An Grosse ubertrifft er die Th. pelagica um ein. 

 Bedeutendes." 



The above is the reference to and a copy of the description of a species 

 recently introduced by Dr. Tschudi, and by him supposed to be new. If all 

 the characters mentioned in the description really obtain, the species is cer- 

 tainly a valid one, for it is not at all like any known species of Stormy Petrel. 

 My reference of it to the genus Procellaria is upon supposition ; for the 

 description affords not the slightest clue to its proper position. I would have 

 preferred to have allowed it to remain under Dr. Tschudi's designation, but 

 as Thalassidroma is an untenable name, I have seen fit to substitute the proper 

 appellation of the genus. It is to be hoped that we may before long know 



1864.] 6 




82 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



more concerning the validity, and in that event, regarding the generic rela- 

 tions, of this supposed specie3. 



?? 8. On the same page where fasciolata is described, Dr. Tschudi goes on 

 to speak of a Petrel of which he saw several examples some degrees further 

 south, but of which he was unable to procure specimens. The mantle was 

 dark gray, the head blackish, the neck somewhat darker ; the feet and bill 

 black, the wing feathers blackish, the abdomen grayish white. In size it 

 hardly equalled pelagica. " Ich wage daher nicht mit Bestimmtheit zu ent- 

 echeiden, ob diese Vogel zu einer Species gehoren, noch dem von mir 

 beobachteten einen Namen zu gaben." A few pages further on (p. 190), the 

 supposed species is named Thai, dubia. As from the circumstances of obser- 

 vation there is extreme liability to error, and, at all events, great uncer- 

 tainty, Thai, dubia had better quietly await more reliable data before claim- 

 ing recognition. 



The remaining species constitute the second group of Procellariea;, separ- 

 able from the preceding group by exceedingly trenchant characters. In 

 the first place, the species all stand, high : the lengthened tarsi much exceed 

 in dimensions the long toes, while at the same time the tibiae are greatly 

 elongated, and bare of feathers for the greater part of their extent. The 

 claws are very different from those of the first section, being broader than 

 high, depressed, not compressed, and always more or less rounded and 

 obtuse. The tail varies, being either rounded, square or forked ; but when 

 the latter, it is never so deeply forked as in oceanodroma, etc., of the first group. 

 The wings are very long, much surpassing the tail. 



Three distinct genera constitute this section. 



g VI. OCEANITES, Keys, et Bias. 



This is the genus of which our common " Wilson's Petrel" is the type, 

 first named Oceanites by Keyserling and Blasius Wirlbelth. Europ. ii., 1364, p. 

 238. It is in many respects the most distinct and remarkable genus of the 

 Procellariea;, being widely diverse in all its characters from all others. It 

 may be well here to define its limits with precision. 



Oceanites, Keys, et Bl. (Type Proc pelagica, Wils. nee Linn.) The bill is 

 short, weak, compressed, its sides a little concave, its tip attenuated, the 

 convexity of the culmen along the unguis comparatively little ; it is less than 

 half as long as the head, about half as long as the middle toe without the 

 claw, about two-fifths the tarsus. The nasal tubes, instead of rising obliquely 

 upwards and forwards, as in the genera of the first section, have their dorsal 

 outline perfectly straight and horizontal. The wings are exceedingly long 

 and acute, and the proportions of the primaries different from that which 

 obtains in any genus hitherto considered ; the second primary very much 

 the longest; the first fully equal to the third ; the fourth very greatly shorter 

 than the first. The tail is of moderate length and nearly square, being 

 neither much forked nor much rounded, large and full, the feathers broad 

 to their very tips. The legs are the most peculiar. The elongated tibiae are 

 bare for an inch or more. The very long tarsi present the remarkable feature 

 of having their anterior and lateral aspects covered with one smooth unbroken 

 podotheca or " boot," resulting from the fusion together of the ordinary plates 

 and scutellae. Posteriorly the plates remain pretty distinct. The toes, 

 though very long, are, without the claws, only two-thirds the tarsus. The 

 hallux is so extremely minute as to be discernible only on close inspection, 

 when it is apparent as an exceedingly short, acute claw. The anterior claws 

 are flattened and broad, and scarcely at all curved. The species of the genus 

 are among the larger in size, with much the colors of Procellaria proper. 



Of the genus as thus constituted, the following species are known to me: 



1. Oceanites oceanica, (Kuhl). 



Procellaria pelagica, Wils. Am. Orn., 1808, vi. p. 90, pi. Ix. Procellaria

 droma oceanica, Gray. Gen. Birds iii., 1849. Thalassidroma Wilsoni, Bonap., J.

Bias. Wirbelth. Europ. ii., 1840, p. 238. Oceanites oceanica, ? This is 



one of the best known and most widely distributed of the Procellarieae. Its 

 characters need not detain us. Some points of synonymy seem, however, to 

 require investigation. 



The first notice of the species is in 1808, when it was accurately described 

 and figured by Wilson, as above, under the erroneous name of Procellaria 

 pdagica, Linn. This error was first noticed and corrected by Bonaparte in 

 the Journal of the Philadelphia Academy for 1823, and the species named 

 Thalassidroma Wilsoni. This is the appellation by which it has been most 

 usually known to, ornithologists. 



In the year 1820 there appeared in Kuhl's Beitrage Zur Zoologie, in the 

 article entitled " Beitrage zur Kenntniss der Procellarien," a description 

 accompanied with a figure of the head, of the present species, under the 

 name of " Procellaria oceanica Banks." The figure is poor, and difficult to 

 recognize, but the full description is pertinent in every respect, and un- 

 equivocally refers to the present species. This name should consequently 

 receive that precedence over Wilsoni to which its priority clearly entitles. 

 Indeed, Bonaparte himself, in his Conspectus Generum Avium, p. 199, and 

 also in his Conspectus Gavia;rum in the Comptes Rendus for April 28, 1856. 

 admits that the two names refer to the same species. 



The only question appears to be this : Banks had, before the appearance of 

 Kuhl's Monograph, applied the name oceanica to specimens of this species 

 from the Southern Oceans. This Australian form Bonaparte considers as a 

 variety of the Atlantic bird, in the fasciculus of his Conspectus bearing date 

 of Jan. 1st, 1856; and shortly afterwards, in the Comptes Rendus for April 

 28, 1856, he accords to it full specific rank. If the Australian form be really 

 a distinct species, then, of course, it would bear Bank's and Kuhl's name of 

 oceanica, and Wilsoni could be retained for the Atlantic species. Such, how- 

 ever, I am confident, is not the case. I have carefully examined specimens 

 of the species from Australia (among them the types of Mr. Gould's work, 

 "The Bird's of Australia"), and I have failed to detect the slightest differ- 

 ences which could even mark the southern bird as a distinct variety. They 

 appear to me absolutely identical, as indeed they are considered by the 

 majority of writers. Such being the case, then, " Wilsoni, Bp.," must become 

 a synonym of oceanica, Kuhl, and the species be known as Oceanites oceanica. 



2. Oceanites mneata, Bonap. ex Peale. 



Thalassidroma lineata, Peale, Ornith. U. S. Expl. Exped. Oceanites Hneata, 

 Bonaparte, Consp. av. ii. 1856, p. 200. Several good examples of this well 

 marked species are in the Smithsonian Museum, being those collected by Mr. 

 Peale himself. It is very different in most of its characters from the preced- 

 ing species. It is a much larger bird. The wing measures 6} inches from 

 the flexure, the tail a little more than 3 inches. The tarsus is If inches 

 long; the middle toe and claw 1^. The bill is larger and stouter, though 

 of the same relative proportions. The tarsi, however, absolutely but little 

 if any longer, and are, therefore, relatively shorter, as lineata is a larger bird. 

 The general pattern of coloration is the same as in oceanica ; but lineata may 

 be readily distinguished by the white streaks which variegate the under sur- 

 face of the body and wings. On the anterior portions of the belly, the black 

 and white are in about equal amount, but more posteriorly and on the 

 crissum, under wing and tail coverts, the white is by far the predominating 

 color. The black appears only along the centre of each feather as a shaft 

 line, producing an appearance which renders the name " lineata" exceedingly 

 pertinent. This species wants the yellow spaces on the interdigital mera-

branes, so conspicuous in oceanica. The most important difference in form 

 between the two species lies in the much greater flatness and obtuseness of 

 the claws of lineata. 



With the following two species I am autoptically unacquainted, and can 

 only judge of their specific validity, and of their generic relations, from the 

 descriptions of their authors. They evidently, however, belong to the long- 

 legged, depressed-clawed group of Stormy Petrel, and I think there can be 

 little or no doubt that they both are species of Oceanites. Such indeed is 

 certainly the case with the Thai, segethi of Phillippi and Landbeck,* the de- 

 scription of which is so complete and perfect in every respect, that I have no 

 difficulty in assigning it to its proper genus. Would that all birds could be 

 as thoroughly described on their first introduction to ornithologists! The 

 Thai, gracilis, Elliot, seems so closely allied to both lineata and segethi, that it 

 can hardly but be an Oceanites] though I cannot speak concerning it with the 

 same degree of certainty as I do regarding the former species. 



3. Oceanites segethi, Coues. ex Ph. et Ldbk. 



Thalassidroma segethi, Phillippi and Landbeck, Wiegmann's Archiv, 1860, p. 

 282. The following description of this species is condensed from the one 

 originally given by its discoverers : 



The bill and feet are glossy black. The head, neck, back, throat and breast, 

 as well as the upper wing coverts, dark blackish gray, the latter, however, 

 tending somewhat towards brownish. Wing and tail feathers deep black. 

 The feathers of the upper parts have white borders, which, however, are 

 worn away in the course of the summer. The inner web of the four outer 

 tail feathers is white at the base. The upper tail coverts, the abdomen, the 

 flanks, and the circumanal region are white. Under tail coverts are black, 

 with white bases and tips. The lesser inferior wing coverts, and the whole 

 border of the wings are black, the rest of the inferior coverts white. 



Length 1\ inches (French). Bill 6 lines ; tail 2 inches 11 lines ; wing 5 

 inches. Tarsus 1 inch 5 lines ; middle toe 10 lines. Naked portion of the 

 tibiae 7 lines: Wings when folded reaching an inch beyond the tail. 

 Habitat. The coast of Chili. 



This species is compared by its describers with the lineata as follows : " It 

 comes nearest to the species described by Titian Peale, in the United States 

 Exploring Expedition, which was found breeding on the Island of Upolu. 

 This species agrees with ours in size, in the form of the feet, and in the 

 colors generally, but differ from it in this respect, that, while in lineata the 

 feathers of the neck are white with black tips, and those of the breast, belly 

 and flanks are white in the middle and black at the tips, in segethi the feathers 

 of the neck and breast are uniformly slatey black, and those of the abdomen 

 and flanks are entirely white ; moreover, in segethi the outermost of the supe- 

 rior tail coverts are wholly white, while in lineata they have black shaft 

 lines." 



This species, however, requires very careful comparison with the succeed- 

 ing, before its claims to specific distinction can be fully substantiated. I do 

 not hesitate to express my decided opinion, that they will be found to be 

 identical; for, so far as I can judge of the colors from the descriptions, they 

 are quite similar, and certain descrepancies in the measurements of the two 

 may result from the difference between the French and English inch. The 

 habitat of the two birds is precisely the same ; still, in view of some points, 

 in the descriptions which do not entirely accord, and especially because it 



* These authors themselves remark (p. 284) " on account of the long legs, and the much abbre- 

 viated hallux, our bird should be referred to Bonaparte's new genus Oceanites; but ; t appears 

 that a generic separation can hardly be mad with propriety upon such inconsiderable differences." 

 May 1 be allowed to ask, with propriety, if Fhnpe of bill, peculiar proportions o' tarsus and toes, 

 length of wings and tail, and above all, the fusion of the tarsal plates can be accounted as "in- 

 coneidejrahle differences 1" 



[March,

seems useless to exchange one doubtful opinion for another, I have preferred 

 to consider both species as valid, until an opportunity be afforded of deter- 

 mining the question with certainty. 



4. Oceanites gracilis, Coues ex Elliot. 



Tkalassidroma gracilis, D. G. Elliot, Sclater's Ibis, 1859, p. 391. "Plumage 

 sooty black. Quill feathers brown. Secondary coverts margined with light 

 brown. Ramp, upper tail coverts and middle of abdomen, white. Tail black, 

 the two outer feathers with a white mark on the lower half of the inner web, 

 growing narrower as it descends ; lower half of the shafts white, the rest 

 black. Under tail coverts white margined with black. Breast sooty. Bill 

 black. Tarsi and feet very long and slender, black. Length 5-90 inches ; 

 wing 5-22 ; tail 2-40 ; bill -40 ; tarsus 1-20." 



Habitat. Coast of Chili. 



In general characters this species seems closely allied to Oceanites lineata, and 

 the pattern of coloration is, in many respects, very similar. The dimensions 

 of the bird, however, will at once separate it from that species ; for the wing 

 is more than half an inch shorter, the tail fully as much less, and the bill, 

 tarsus and toes are proportionally as much smaller in dimensions. As already 

 remarked, it comes much nearer to the 0. segethi, and is very possibly the 

 same bird. In the event of this proving to be the case, gracilis, Elliot, has 

 priority over segcthi, Ph. et L., and must be retained as the name of the 

 species. 



VII. FREGETTA, Bp. 



This well marked genus, as limited by its author, Bonaparte, contains sev- 

 eral species, all more or less closely allied to each other, and agreeing in the 

 possession of the following generic characters : The bill is small and short,. 

 measuriag in length hardly half that of the skull ; about as high as broad 

 at the base, the sides converging rapidly toward a somewhat compressed, at- 

 tenuated and decurved tip. The nasal tubes are stout, short and elevated 

 towards their extremities. The culmen and commissure are both much de- 

 curved. The wings are rather elongated, reaching a little beyond the tail ; 

 the second primary is longest, the third nearly equal ; the first generally 

 between the third and fourth. The tail is long, nearly square, but sometimes 

 more or less emarginate ; the rectrices all exceedingly broad to their very 

 tips, which are subtruncated. The legs are long and stout; the tibiae naked 

 for a considerable space ; the tarsi much exceed in length the toes, which 

 latter are very short, unusually stout, and connected by rather narrow webs. 

 The species are all of rather large size, and stout form, and are bicolor, the 

 dark and light colors occupying distinct areas. The type of the genus is the 

 Thalasxidroma tropica, Gould, which, with the other species, chiefly inhabit the 

 intertropical and southern seas. 



The genus is so well marked as to require special comparison with no 

 other. The following are the species composing it with which I am ac- 

 quainted : 

 1. Fregetta tropica, Bp. ex Gould. 



First described by Gould, Ann. et Magaz. Nat. Hist. vol. xiii. p 366, under 

 the name of Thalassidroma tropica, this species is referred to its proper genus 

 by Bonaparte, in his Conspectus Generum Avium, p. 197, and also in his 

 Conspectus Gaviarium, p. 797 of the Comptes Rendus for 1856. If there be 

 other synonyms of the species, I have not met with them. 



It is the largest species of the genus, measuring 8'75 to 9-00 inches in 

 length. The tail is more forked than in the other representatives of the 

 genus, the depth of the emargination being f of an inch. The bill measures 

 a little more than ^ the length of the tarsus and it is rather stout, especially 

 at the base, where it is broader than high. The tarsus varies from If to If 

 of an inch in length ; the middle toe with its claw \\ inches, or a little more, 



1864.] 




86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



The plumage is fuliginous black ; the lower part of the breast, the belly, the 

 sides under the wings, both tail coverts, the throat, and a nuchal collar, 

 white. 



The species inhabits the intertropical portions of both the Atlantic and 

 Pacific Oceans. 



In the shape of the bill, emargination of the tail, length of wing, and pe- 

 culiar proportions of the tarsus and toes, this species differs somewhat from 

 the other representatives of the genus Fregetta, as here adopted, so much so, 

 that ornithologists may perhaps hereafter find it expedient to restrict the genus 

 to this single type, and present the remaining species under a different ge- 

 neric appellation. 



2. Fregetta grallaria, Bp. ex Vieillot. 



This long known species has, in spite of its well marked characters, been 

 presented under so numerous and diverse designations, that its synonymy re- 

 quires careful consideration. 



The first unequivocal indication of this species that I have met with is that 

 given by Vieillot, on page 418 of vol. xxvi of the Nouveau Dictionnaire, (1817,) 

 under the name of '' Le petrel exhasse, Procellaria grallaria." The accompa- 

 nying description, though brief, is entirely pertinent to the present species ; 

 and Vieillot's name is, therefore, entitled to priority over subsequent desig- 

 nations. 



Prof. Lichtenstein has, in the Catalogue of the Duplicates of the Berlin 

 Museum, page 83, (1823), conferred the name grallaria upon a different species, 

 Yiz : the melanogastra of Gould. 



In 1820 ihe species was presented by Kuhl, Monogr. Proc, p. 138. pi. x. fig. 3, 

 under the name of" Procellaria /regatta, Banks." This author's description is 

 very full and quite accurate, but he erroneously adduces the name " P. xquorea" 

 as a synonym, whereas the latter really is a synonym of quite another species, 

 viz : the Procellaria marina of Latham. 



Bonaparte acknowledges, in his Conspectus, p. 198, the error he committed 

 in 1828, of referring to this species under the name of Thalassidroma oceanica, 

 he having in his synopsis of the Birds of North America confounded Vieillot's 

 grallaria with the Oceanites oceanica of this paper. 



Finally, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Mr. Gould describes 

 this species as new under the name of Thalassidroma leucogastra. 



A tine suite of specimens are before me, among which are some of Mr. Gould's 

 typical examples, received by the Philadelphia Academy from him. They vary 

 more than is usual among the Procellaria, in the color of the upper parts, 

 which ranges from a deep fuliginous brownish black to a much lighter plum- 

 beous or ashen hue. Some the lightest colored ones have all the dorsal 

 feathers edged with greyish white. The circumocular region is usually the 

 darkest colored. The white of the under parts varies exceedingly in extent; 

 it sometimes reaches far up on the throat, including nearly all the under sur- 

 face of the bird ; while in other examples it is nearly as much restricted, that 

 is to say, descends as low on the breast as is usual in examples of melanogastra. 

 The lightest colored birds are apparently the most immature. 



The bill is stout, nearly as high as broad at the base, measuring from the 

 front to apex, about half the length of the skull. The nasal tubes are long and 

 elevated. The wings are moderately long, reaching just beyond the very 

 slightly emarginate tail. The second primary is longest ; the third nearly 

 equal ; the first iutermediate between the third and fourth. The rectrices are 

 exceedingly broad to their very tips, which are subtruncated. The tibiaj are 

 denuded fur the space of one inch. The tarsus measures 1-50 to 1-60 inches, 

 the middle toe and claw 1-05 to 1-10. The wing from the flexure measures 6 

 inches. 



The species inhabits the tropical portions of both oceans.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 87 



3. Fregetta melanogastra, Bp. ex Gould. 



Thalassidroma melanogastra, Gould, Ann. et Mag. Nat. Hist., xiii. p. 36V. 



I have had an opportunity of examining Mr. Gould's typical specimens of 

 this species, now in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy. Although it 

 is very closely allied to the preceding, both in form and colors, yet it con- 

 stantly differs as follows : While a somewhat smaller bird, it has yet consid- 

 erably longer tarsi and toes ; the bill is longer, slenderer, with a more atten- 

 uated and gradually decurved unguis. The wing is nearly an inch shorter ; 

 the proportions of the primaries about the same as in grallaria. The tail 

 is about a third of an inch less. With the same general distribution of colors 

 as in ffrallaria, this species differs in the presence of a central longitudinal brown- 

 ish black streak, which divides the white of the abdomen into two symmetrical 

 lateral halves. This ray is not always perfect, being sometimes only indicated 

 by a few disconnected, black feathers. I have never, however, in a large num- 

 ber of specimens seen it entirely wanting, but even if this be ever the case, the 

 species may be readily diagnosed by its peculiarities of size and form above 

 detailed. 



The species inhabits the tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean. 



This is, in all probability, the species indicated by Forster, Descriptiones 

 Animalium, Edit. Lichten^tein, 1844, p. 180, under the name of " Procellaria 

 fregata, Linn. ;" at least, I judge this to be the case (although no mention is 

 made of the ventral ray) from the annexed foot-note, by Prof. Lichtenstein, in 

 which the latter says that it is upon this species (fregata, Forst.) he has based 

 his Procellaria grallaria, (Cat. Dupl. Berl. Mus. p. 83) which is " ob longitudi- 

 nem pedum segreganda." This length of the feet is exactly the most patent 

 point of difference in form of this species from the preceding.

 ral History, 1851, p. 117. Fregetta Lawrencii, Bonaparte, Conspectus Avium. 

 ii. p. 198. 



It is exceedingly to be regretted that the typical and only known specimen 

 of this species has been lost, so that there is no opportunity of comparing it 

 with leucogastra, to which it is so very closely allied. I can, therefore, do no 

 more than simply present Mr. Lawrence's description, from which ornithologists 

 must judge for themselves regarding its specific validity. 



" Head and wings black ; neck, breast and back dark plumbeous, or dull 

 bluish ash ; wing coverts brown; the tail white at the base, with the terminal 

 half and the two central feathers black; abdomen, inside of wings and rump, 

 white ; bill and legs black. Tail even ; claws flattened and of an ovate form. 

 Length about 8 inches ; wing 6 ; tail 3 ; tarsus If. (Gen. Rep. Birds N. A., 

 p. 832). 



I VII. PELAGODROMA, Reichenbach. 



A very peculiar genus of Procellarieae, readily recognizable by the following 

 characters : 



Bill very long, but little less than the head, exceedingly slender, much com- 

 pressed, higher than broad at the base, the nasal tubes very short, less than 

 half the culmen, the unguis attenuated only slightly and very gradually de- 

 curved. Wings of moderate length, reaching just beyond the tail; second 

 primary longest, third nearly equal, first about equal to the fourth. Tail very 

 long, nearly square or but slightly emarginated, the feathers all exceedingly 

 broad to their truncated apices. Legs very long, somewhat stout, only mod- 

 erately compressed. Tibiae denuded for an inch or more. Tarsus of ordinary 

 length for this group ; toes all unusually long, the middle with its claw being 

 but little less than the tarsus. Iuterdigital membranes all very full and broad. 

 Of large size, rather stout form, and variegated colors. 



This genus agrees with Fregetta in many respects, but differs markedly from 



1864.] 




88 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



it in the length, straightness and attenuation of the bill ; and in the very unusu- 

 ally long toes, with their broad, full, interdigital membranes. The pattern of 

 coloration is very dissimilar from that of most of the species of Fregetta or 

 indeed of any other genus of Procellarieae. 



The long and well known Procellaria fregetta of Linnaeus is its typical and 

 only species. 



I. Pel^godroma fregata, Bp. ex Linn.* 



The history of the synonymy of this species is somewhat involved, since, as 

 demonstrated in the annexed foot-note, the Procellaria fregata of Linnteus has 

 been very variously interpreted by different writers. Some authors have con- 

 sidered it as referring to the tropica of Gould, others to the grallaria of Yieillot, 

 others again to the melanogastra of Gould ; while one author has applied the 

 name to a new species, afterwards dedicated to him by Bonaparte. (Fregetta 

 Lawrencii.) But I entirely agree with Prof. Lichenstein," (foot-note on page 180 

 of Forster's " Descriptions Animalium") and with Bonaparte (Conspectus, p. 

 198) that the Froc. fregata, Linn., was based upon the bird first described by 

 Barrere, and which Latham subsequently more definitely characterized as 

 Procellaria marina. With this view of the case, the following is an exposition 

 of the synonymy of the species in question : 



Proc. fregata Linnasus, S. N. i. 1766, (nee Forster, nee Kuhl., nee Lawrence.) 

 Procellaria marina, Latham, Ind. Ornith. ii. 1790, et Kuhl, Monog. Proc. 1823, 

 p. 138, pi. x, fig. 2. Thalassidroma marina, Gray, Genera Birds, iii. 1849. Pe- 

 lagodroma marina, Reichenbach, Syst. Av. Pelagodroma fregata, Bp.,Consp. Av. 

 n. 1856, p. 198. Procellaria sequorea, Solander. Procellaria hypoleuca, Webb et 

 Berth., Av. Canar. 



This large and beautiful species, so peculiar both in form and colors, is too 

 well known to require any description in this connection. 



There is in the Philadelphia Academy a very young individual of this species 

 which has not yet wholly emerged from the downy state of plumage. Yet, 

 although so very immature, the peculiar color and markings of the adults are 

 already entirely apparent. This is ample evidence that the birds of this group 

 are subject to no changes of plumage of any consequence in their progress 

 towards maturity. I have fortunately been able to extend the same observa- 

 tion to other species. A fledgling of Cgmochorea leucorrhoa, now before me, has 

 exactly the pattern of coloration of the adults, and the uropygial white is 

 already discernable, the only difference being that the black is rather of a 

 slaty than of a fuliginous tint. The chief variations of plumage to which, at 

 least, the fuliginous species are subject, will all be found, I think, to depend 

 upon season. After the moults, when the feathers are fresh and new, they are 

 much darker, and more uniformly so, than after they have become old and 

 worn. Their tips then assume a somewhat lighter brown color, and the dull 

 brown alar fascia, common to so many of the species, becomes much more con- 

 spicuous. This is readily demonstrable by examining any of the fuliginous 

 species during the moult, when the old and new feathers will be found to be 

 quite different in the precise shade of the fuliginous brown. 



The preceding pages contain notices of all the known species of Procellarieae 



* Among the Procellarieae no name has been so indiscriminately used by authors for so many 

 different species as "fregata, Linn.," variously spelled fregata, f regatta, fregetta, etc. That this

with which I am acquainted, as well as references to and criticisms upon the 

 more or less doubtfully valid ones. I have purposely, however, omitted all 

 consideration of the Procellaria Bulweri of Jardine and Selby in this connec- 

 tion, because I cannot regard it as belonging to this group at all. This spe- 

 cies the Thalassidroma Bulweri of some authors the Puffinus columbinus, 

 Webb et Berth the Procellaria anjinko, Heine is by Bonaparte made the 

 type of a genus Bulweria, which its author places among the Procellarieae. 

 But I assert most confidently that the bird in question is not a " Stormy 

 Petrel" at all, but a species of the section Fulmareee, closely allied to, and 

 entirely congeneric with, the P. allantica, Gould, and the P. alerrima, Verreaux, 

 which compose Bonaparte's genus Pterodroma. The mo^t constant and uni- 

 formly diagnostic character of the Stormy Petrels proper is found in the short- 

 ness of the first primary, compared with the second and third, and in a cer- 

 tain peculiar flexibility and elasticity of all the remiges. The P. Bulweri has 

 none of these characteristics. The general contour of the bill, and especially 

 the size and shape of the nasal tubes are very difierent from what obtains 

 throughout the Procellarieae; while the feet and tail disagree to a scarcely 

 less marked extent. The fact of its small size seems to me no argument for 

 its introduction into this section, for it is scarcely smaller than several species 

 of Puffineae, e. g., nugax, Solander, or yelknan, Acerbi. In my mind there is 

 no doubt that Dr. Schlegel has correctly indicated its affinities in placing it in 

 intimate connection with the Pterodroma aterrima, Verreaux, and atlanlica, 

 Gould. 



The following is a brief synopsis of the genera and species of the section, 

 prepared according to the views expressed in the preceding pages. It is made 

 as brief as is consistent with perspicuity, only the more important features

* Typographical error. 



| Having examined many specimens of bulbosum and ovalis, I find no difference of specific 

 weight. 



1 1 have not seen this species. 



More inflated, heavier, much lighter in color, not so strongly striated, and with narrower 

 bands than .V. globosum, Auth. In a very fine specimen before me, the body whorl is disposed to 

 be tuberculate below the suture. 



|i Mr. Reeve Lguies two distinct species for this shell; his fig. i a. is S. Wetumpkaense, Lea, and 

 fig. 1 b. is S. Buddii, Lea. 



f I hare seen no authentic specimens of this species. 



** Never published by Mr. Anthony, who sent a specimen with label attached, marked " Proc. 

 A. N. S.," to Mr. Reeve. Mr. Keeve, misled by this reference, refers in his description to Anc. 

 ornata, Authouy, and consequently assigns North Carolina as the habitat. No species of Schizos- 

 toma is known to exist out of Coosa Kiver, Alabama. S. ornata is the young of Wetumpkaense. 



tf Mr. Reeve's figure 20, intended for this species, I refer to S. babylonicum, Lea. Alabamense is 

 distinguished from babylonicum by the regularity of its striae.

* Mr. Reeve's figure (3) of this speecies is a Goniobasis lata, Jay. 



fThis figure does not so well represent funiculatum as fig. 1, b, intended for & pagoda. 



% Mr. Lea, (Jour. Aca<i. Nat. Sci., v. pt. 3), makes this species to equal his S. constrictum. I do 

 not consider them the same; constrictum is longer and narrower. 



j} Mr. Reeve's figure 7, a, represents rather a smooth variety of salebrosum, Anth. 



D In a large number of specimens before me, the distinctive features of salebrosum and robustum 

 become so completely and insensibly merged together that I cannot separate them, and believe 

 them to be identical. 



fl Closely allied to S. incisum, but may be distinguished by being heavier, of different color, 

 higher spire, and more convex outline.

* In treating viridis as a synonym of trilineala, I agree with the opinions expressed by Messrs. 

 Haldeman, Brot, Biuney and Anthony. The two former gentlemen, together with Dr. Jay, con- 

 sider costntus, Anthony, and occidentalis. Lea, as synonyms also. In this opinion I cannot coin- 

 cide. The two species appear to me to be well separate 1 by the costse of Mr. Anthony's species, 

 and the uniformly smooth surface of trilin-eatus. Mr. Reeve's figure of trilineatus is very poor ; 

 the bands are so represented as to appear like ribs. 



It is by no means certain that trilineata is ai Anculosa. Its general appearance suggests affini- 

 ties with the Amnicolidm, to which family several small species, hitherto considered to be Ancu- 

 losa; have been recently removed. It differs from all the Amnicolse, however, in its colored bands. 



Mr. Lea's M. viridis is tbe Var. B. of Mr. Say's description of trilineata.

Descriptions of New Species of Birds of the Families CJEBEBIDJE, TAN- 

 AGRID.E, ICTERID.E, and SCOLOPACID.E. 



BY GEO. N. LAWRENCE. 



Fam. CjEREBIDJE. 

 Dacnis ultramarina. 



D cserebicolor, Lawr. nee. Scl., Ann., N. Y. Lye. Vol. vii., p. 291. 



Male. General color ultramarine blue, lores, chin, throat, middle of back, 

 wings and tail black ; the black on the throat dull in color ; the wing coverts, 

 quills and central tail feathers margined with ultramarine blue ; bill black, 

 the base of the under mandible below flesh color ; iris brown ; tarsi and toes 

 reddish yellow. 



Length 4| in.; wing 2|; tail 1| ; bill ; tarsi 9-16. 



The female is yellowish green, with the front, part of the crown and sides 

 of the head bluish ; throat ashy; the under plumage lighter green, the middle 

 of the abdomen yellowish. 



Habitat. New Granada, Isthmus of Panama. 



In distribution of colors this species closely resembles cserebicolor Scl., 

 and cayana ; it is, however, lighter in color than the first, and darker than the 

 last; it differs from both in the black not extending behind the eye, in the 

 dull color of the black spot on the throat, which in the others is of a deep 

 black and more clearly defined ; cserebicolor is purple blue, and cayana 

 greenish or verditer blue. 



Fam. TANAGRIDJE. 

 Saltator intermedius. 



S. mag mis, Lawr. nee. Gm., Ann., N. Y. Lye. Vol. vii. p. 297. 



Male. Upper plumage yellowish olive green ; the front and top of the 

 head intermixed with bluish cinereous ; a white stripe from the bill over the 

 eye ; sides of the head bluish cinereous ; tail of the same color as the upper 

 plumage; quills brownish black, the outer webs same color as the back; 

 chiu white ; on the throat is a tawny or'fulvous spot entirely surrounded by 

 a narrow band of black, which runs down on each side of the throat and 

 assumes a rounding form on the upper part of the breast ; breast and abdo- 

 men cinereous tinged with pale tawny ; under tail coverts bright fulvous ; 

 bill black ; iris brown ; legs reddish brown. 



Length 8 in. ; wing 4 ; tail 4; bill f ; tarsi 1. 



The femtile differs only in the black not extending across the breast below 

 the fulvous spot. 



Habitat. New Granada, Isthmus of Panama. 



At the time of referring this species to S. magnus, I had but a single exam- 

 ple, a female, which much resembles that species, and I. would not have 

 inclined to separate them, but since then receiving other specimens of both 

 sexes, and finding the fulvous spot on the throat of the male to be encircled 

 with black, as in <S. magnoides, I have not hesitated to pronounce it a distinct 

 species. It differs from magnus in the fulvous spot not only being brighter 

 and deeper in color, but of three times the extent ; in having a black band 

 on the breast, and in the color of the under tail coverts being much darker, 

 more rufous. From magnoides it differs in the head above being mixed with 

 olive green, in the white on the chin extending to the bill, whereas, in mag- 

 noides the black lines on the sides of the throat come together on the chin ; 

 the fulvous on the throat is not quite so bright, but is of twice the extent of 

 that of magnoides, and the black band on the breast of only about one-third 

 the breadth of it in that species ; the breast of magnoides is of a clear cine- 

 reous and the crissum lighter than in the new bird. 



In color and markings it seems to be intermediate between magnus and 

 magnoides, the crissum, however, in my species is darker than in either of the 

 others.

Fam. ICTERIDJE. 



Oassicus vitellinus. 



Cassicus icteronotus, Lawr. nee Vieill., Annals of Lye. of N. Hist., N. Y., Vol. 

 vii. p. 297. 



Male. Deep velvety black, with the lower part of the back, a broad mark 

 on the wing coverts next the back, upper and under tail coverts, basal half 

 of tail feathers and crissuin, deep yellow or yolk-of-egg color; the upper 

 middle tail coverts are tipped with black ; upper mandible yellowish white, 

 lower pale plumbeous white ; iris blue ; tarsi and toes black. 



Length 12 in. ; wing 7| -; tail 4|; bill 1 9-16 ; tarsi If. 



The female differs only in being smaller, and measures in length 9| in. ; 

 wiug 5 J ; tail 4 ; bill 1J; tarsi 1 1-16. 



Habitat. New Granada, Isthmus of Panama, where it is very abundant ; 

 I have also seen it from Nicaragua. 



This species, which f mistook for ft per situs, Linn., [icteronotus, Vieill.), at 

 first sight appears much like it, but differs in being larger, in the yellow 

 being much deeper in color, the upper mandible much stronger, with the 

 culmen more curved, and the base of the upper mandible in front much 

 broader ; but the most marked difference is in the extent of the yellow on 

 the tail feathers, on the central feathers reaching two inches from the base, 

 and decreasing a little on the outer ones, giving a rounding form to the mark 

 of this color on the tail ; but in ft persicus, the yellow, although reaching 

 about the same distance from the base on the central feathers, extends 

 rapidly towards the end of the tail on the outer ones, on the second and third 

 lateral feathers coming within one and a quarter inches of the end; in other 

 words, in looking towards the end of the tail, the yellow mark in my species 

 is rounding in form, whereas, in persicus, the mark of this color is very deeply 

 hollowed out. 



Fam. SCOLOPACIDJE. 



Erecnetes occidentalis. 



Adult in spring. Upper plumage varied with black, bright chestnut, ashy 

 brown and white, each feather having a black centre, with bright chestnut 

 margins and tipped with greyish white ; the central upper tail coverts 

 brownish black, the outer coverts white spotted with black near their ends, 

 central tail feathers blackish brown, the other tail feathers light ash ; pri- 

 maries and secondaries blackish brown on their outer webs and tips, 

 and dark ash on their inner webs ; outer tertials dark ash, the inner 

 black in the centre with bright chestnut margins ; scapulars bright chest- 

 nut in the centre, broadly black near the end, and terminating with 

 white ; wing coverts ashy brown with greyish edgings ; front sides of 

 the crown to eye and under plumage white ; a dusky line tinged with 

 rufous extends from the bill to the eye ; ear coverts rufous ; front, sides of 

 the head and throat marked with minute spots of ashy brown, breast and 

 sides conspicuously marked with much larger spots of dark brown ; under 

 tail coverts white, a. few with central dark brown spots ; iris brown ; bill and 

 feet jet black. 



Length (i\ in. ; wing 3| ; tail 1| ; bills from to 1 1-16 ; tarsi f . 



Habitat. Pacific coast ; California, Oregon. 



This species differs hoxa. pusillus in the greater amount and brightness of 

 the chestnut coloring of the upper plumage, but most conspicuously in the 

 more decided character of the spots on the breast and sides, these being 

 very much larger than those of pusilius ; the bills also appear to average longer, 

 and the tarsi and toes are jet black, which in the other are yellowish green. 



The tertials are very long, reaching nearly to the end of the longest pri- 

 mary ; the feet are semipalmated about the same as those of pusilius. 'Eleven 

 specimens from the Pacific coast are now before me, four of my own and the 



1864.] 




108 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



others belonging to the Smithsonian Institution, kindly sent me by Prof. 

 Baird for examination ; three have their bills 1 1-16 in. in length all have 

 the bright chestnut coloring above and are conspicuously spotted below, with 

 the legs uniformly deep black. Those killed even towards the end of July 

 retain the chestnut color above and the spots on the under plumage, whereas 

 at that time E. pusillus has scarcely any rufous coloring above, and is below 

 entirely destitute of spots, with a wash of a light tawny color on the upper 

 part of the breast. 



Mr. E. Coues suspected probably that more than one species existed in 

 North America, for in his able Monograph of the Tringse, published in the 

 Proc. of the Phil. Acad, of Sci., 1861, p. 177, in a note under E. pusilhis, he 

 says, " I am by no means satisfied that but a single species of Ereuneles exists 

 in N. A. The difference in size, in length and proportions of the tarsus 

 even, and especially in the bill, cause it to seem almost impossible that all 

 the specimens before me are specifically the same," &cl* 



He however made no positive determination of there being more than one 

 species. See his remarks in the note referred to above. 



I have had specimens of the so-called E. manri sent me from Cuba by Dr. 

 Gundlach for examination, and have found it to agree precisely with examples 

 of pusillus from the Atlantic coast.

 There ar* six in number, all of which I believe to be undescribed. The three 

 Spathse have the peculiar African type, and probably were furnished with sy- 

 phons. In one of the species we have, for the first time, an alute type. The 

 three Uniones differ from any type I have heretofore seen from Africa, and they 

 take more of that of India in the subtriangular form Rajahensis, (nobis,) for 

 instance and in the subplicate character of some of our southern species in- 

 clining to nodulous. It is greatly to be regretted that none of the soft parts 

 were preserved, that we might compare their anatomy with those from Ame- 

 rica. Lake Nyassa is one of the three great central lakes of Africa, and has a 

 southern drainage in the Zambezi River. It is, in extent, as Dr. Kirk informs 

 me by letter, " exceeding two hundred miles north and south, and from fifteen 

 to sixty miles wide, and is fifteen hundred feet above the sea. It lies between 

 the parallels of 14 and 18 south latitude.

Since I published, in 1841 and previously, a number of new species of Sue- 

 cinea, Dr. Barney's Terrestrial Shells of the United States has appeared. In 

 vol. 2d, pages 65 and 66, he gives eight of my species with the Latin diagnoses, 

 and says he had seen Wardiana, Totteniana, Nuttalliana and aurea, but has no 

 knowledge of the others, except what he derived from descriptions and figures. 

 He says that, " on a careful examination, it appears to us that S. aperta and 

 S. aurea are well established species; that Wardiana is synonymous with 

 avara, Say ; Totteniana with ovalis, Say ; Nuttalliana with ovalis, Gould ; inflaia 

 with campfstris, Say ; that retusa is probably synonymous with ovalis, Gould ; 

 and that Oregonensis cannot be at present ascertained.'' All naturalists must 

 regret introducing this kind of confusion in a difficult branch of science, and 

 had Dr. Binuey given more time to the subject, my types being always open 

 to his inspection, I cannot doubt but that he would have avoided this attack 

 upon my species. His editor, Dr. Gould, has in part corrected his synonymy, 

 and Mr. W. G. Binney, in the continuation of his father's beautiful work (vol. 

 4), makes further correction of these hasty and erroneous criticisms. Dr. Gould 

 says that Nuttalliana " no doubt is a well marked species;" of course it is not 

 ovalis, Gould ; that Oregonensis is "decidedly a well marked species." Totteniana, 

 Dr. Gould Bays, differs from ovalis, Say, that " it is a thinner and more fragile 

 shell, propoitionally more ventricose in form, with a shorter spire, a larger 

 aperture," &c. Mr. W. G. Binney says, in vol.4, p. 34, that in regard toinflata 

 he "is inclined to doubt its specific weight." On a careful examination and 

 comparison of specimens with campestris, sent, to me as such by Dr. Ravenel, 

 from Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, I find these agree with the description 

 of Mr. Say and Dr. Binney, except that the full-grown specimens show a fourth 

 whorl, aud not three, as both authors state in their description. This, I think, 

 arises from their mode of counting. If a fourth whorl can be seen on a speci- 

 men, even if it be not complete, I always count as four whorls, as fractions 

 cannot conveniently and correctly be enumerated in small shells. My inflaia 

 has but three whorls, is smoother, more inflated and more obtuse in the spire. 

 With these differences it ought not to be made a synonym until more observa- 

 tions, under better circumstances, should prove it to be such. As regards Tot- 

 teniana, Mr. W. G. Binney says he " agrees entirely with Mr. Lea and Dr. Gould 

 in separating it from obliqua, Say." 



After a careful examination of the original specimens, with the addition of 

 subsequent acquisitions, I am perfectly satisfied of the correctness of my first 

 convictions, as to there being eight species, which Dr. Binney would reduce to 

 two, and they may be stated as follows : 



S. aperta, Dr. Binney allows to be established. 



S. aurea, Dr. Binney allows to be established. 



S. retusa, Dr. Binney says is probably ovalis, Gould. It differs, nevertheless, 

 in being retuse at the base and iu being less inflated. 



S. Wardiana, Dr. Binney says is synonymous with avara, Say. But Wardiana 

 is a more slender species, and is more oblique. It is evident that Dr. 

 B. figures two species under this name, pi. 57c.

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. Ill 



S. Totteniana. Dr. Binney says this is synonymous with ovalis. Say.* But 

 Dr. Gould properly says it differs in being more fragile, and has 

 a shorter spire. It also differs in color. The interior of all my speci- 

 mens is iridescent, a character I have never seen in ova/is. Mr. W. G. 

 Binney says (v. 4,) he " agrees entirely with Lea and Gould in sepa- 

 rating it from obliqua, Say." 



S. Nuttalliana. Dr. Binney says this is synonymous with ovalis, Gould. Dr. 

 G., however, says this " no doubt is a well-marked species." It cer- 

 tainly is very different from ovalis, Gould, being much more slender, 

 more oblique, and different in color. In fact I believe that Dr. Gould 

 has described the same shell as ruslicana, in his volume of " Expedi- 

 tion Shells, p. 28." 



S. Oregonensis. Dr. Binney says that this "cannot at present be ascer- 

 tained." Dr. Gould says that the specimens famished by Mr. Lea 

 " leave no doubt of being decidedly a well-marked species." Oregon- 

 ensis is perhaps nearest to Wardiana, but that shell has a smoother 

 surface, is greenish, while Oregonensis is yellowish, and in the turns 

 of the spire they differ entirely. 



S. inflata. Dr. Binney makes this synonymous with campestris, Say. Mr. 

 W. G. Binney says be " is inclined to doubt its specific weight." In- 

 flata is smoother, more inflated and more obtuse in the spire, as well 

 as in really having one whorl less. It ought to be retained until more 

 specimens could be examined. This species was founded on a single 

 specimen sent by Dr. Ravenel, who also sent me the true campestris.

A Critical Review of the Family PROCELLARIDiE : Part II. ; Embracing the 



PUFFINEJE. 



BY ELLIOTT COUES, M. D. ) U. 8. A. 



Tbe present paper is the second of a series in which it is proposed to con- 

 sider the entire family of Petrels. The first fasciculus in which the Procel- 

 larieae or " Stormy Petrels" are reviewed, has already appeared in these Pro- 

 ceedings ; in the present continuation of the subject are embraced the Puf- 

 finese, or "Shearwaters." 



In writing upon the Procellariese I had regard more particularly to the 

 generic disposition of the species ; for most of them were so well known as 

 to require comparatively little comment upon their specific distinctions. 

 With tthe Puffiuere, however, the case is exactly the reverse. While 

 the generic groups are very plainly indicated, the species compri ed in each 

 are for the most part quite numerous, and their relations to each other, gene- 

 rally so very intimate, as regards size, form, and color, that it requires care- 

 ful and discriminating comparison to separate them. I have, therefore, given 

 this part of tbe subject in hand special attention ; and have gone consider- 

 ably into details in my examination of the specific characters and relation- 

 ships of the numerous components of the group, believing that in no other 

 way can the desirable degree of information on the subject be attained. At 



TApril, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA.. 117 



the same time the many intricate questions of synonymy involved have 

 necessitated somewhat lengthy discussions. 



In my arrangement of the genera and species I have closely followed that 

 given by Bonaparte in his Conspectus ; except that I place among the Puf- 

 finefe the genus Adamastor, which Bonaparte considers as belonging to the Ful- 

 marea?. The position of this genus is, indeed, a little uncertain, the char- 

 acters of the bill approximating to those of the Fulniarea?. Its bill, how- 

 ever, is almost identical with that of Majaqueus ; and it agrees so closely in 

 other respects that the two genera cannot be placed in different groups ; while 

 the possession by each of twelve, instead of fourteen or sixteen rectrices, 

 plainly indicates that they belong to the Puffinese rather than to the Fulmarea?. 



The Puffinese, as I regard them, are composed of five genera, viz : Maja- 

 queus, Adamastor, Thiellus, Nectris and Puffinus. The two first of these are 

 very different from the three last in many respects ; and warrant a sub- 

 division of the section into two groups. The first, or the " Fulmar-Puffins,^ ' 

 have the bill stouter than ordinary ; the nasal tubes longer, more elevated, 

 more decidedly tubular, vertically truncated at their apices, and the nasal 

 septum thinner ; the wings and tail shorter. The three latter of the above- 

 named genera constitute the "Puffins proper." The bill is very long and 

 slender ; the nasal tubes short, broad, depressed, obliquely truncated ; 

 the nasal septum thick ; the wings and tail very long, the latter much 

 rounded ; and the feet very large. As for the genera themselves, they are 

 hardly worth retaining, except it be for convenience' sake. Thiellus is mere- 

 ly Nectris with a longer and more decidedly cuneiform tail ; while Nectris 

 hardly differs from Puffinus, except in its rather slenderer bill, and entirely 

 fuliginous color. The subdivision of Puffinus into " Ardenna," " Priofhius," 

 and " Puffinus" seems quite unwarrantable. 



I shall consider the species of the five genera in the order in which they are 

 named above, and conclude with a brief synopsis of the section in accord- 

 ance with the results arrived at in the investigation. 



MAJAQUEUS, Reich. 



Gen. char. Bill a little shorter than the head, about equal to the tarsus, 

 stout, compressed, higher than broad at the base, the culmen rising imme- 

 diately from the nostrils, the unguis largl, very convex, much hooked. Com- 

 missure unusually curved from feathers to unguis, the concavity looking up 

 wards ; outline of inferior mandibular rami quite straight to the unguis. 

 Nasal tubes long, (nearly a third the length of the culmen), elevated, laterally 

 obliquely flattened, carinated along the median line, apically vertically trun- 

 cated, with a considerable emarginatiou ; nostrils quite circular ; the septum 

 narrow for this section. Wings very short for this family. Tail also exceed- 

 ingly short, and subtruncated, the graduation of the lateral feathers being 

 slight. Feet stout, the tarsus greatly abbreviated, being much shorter than 

 the middle toe without its claw. Outer toe without claw longer than the 

 middle. Tip of the inner claw reaching the base of the middle one. Of large 

 size, dark color, and exceeding robust form. 



The preceding paragraph characterizes a marked and very peculiar genus 

 of Procellaridse. It is at once distinguished from all its allies by the com- 

 bination of the large size, extreme robustness of bill and feet, as well of the 

 whole body, the unusually short wings and tail, the dark colors, etc' It is 

 most nearly allied to Adamastor, the bills of the types of the two genera 

 being almost identical ; but other characters readily distinguish the two. 



Two species of this genus are recognized by ornithologists. Dr. Schlegel 

 has well shown that it is rather by peculiarities of form and size that conspicil- 

 latus is to be distinguished, if at all, from aequinoctialis.

It is unnecessary to give any description of this long and well known 

 species. 



The white spots on the throat and cheeks appear to vary much with age. 

 In the perfectly adult bird the triangular gular spot is alone left ; that on the 

 cheeks, which is connected with it in immature birds, having disappeared. Very 

 young birds have the under parts almost wholly whitish, which afterwards 

 deepens into fuliginous. 



The present is one of the three species of Procellaridas, (pelagica, aequinoc- 

 tialis, capensis), known to Linnaeus in 1758, and given in the sixth edition of 

 his Systema Natura?. The name aequinoctialis appears, according to the obser- 

 vations of most naturalists, to be geographically erroneous ; and probably on 

 this account it was changed to niijra by Forster in 1772. But as it is impos- 

 sible to say exactly what are the limits of a Procellaridian's wanderings, it- 

 would be hardly warrantable, I think, to change Linnaeus' appellation. 

 There are no points of synonymy which require discussion here.

Habitat. Australian Seas. 



This species, despite the peculiar markings of the head, which usually 

 characterize it, is, nevertheless, exceedingly closely allied to the preceding. 

 Examination of the large series in the Philadelphia Academy collection shows 

 the markings to be very variable as to their extent, and that they are some- 

 times hardly traceable at all. (Consult on this point Dr. SchlegeFs mono- 

 graph, where the point is fully elucidated.) In the majority of specimens 

 the submental white patch is more or less perfectly connected with a broad 

 white stripe, which, passing from the feathers on the side of the lower man- 

 dible, runs backwards on the side of the head, below the eye, curving up- 

 wards on the occiput, so as nearly to meet its fellow of the opposite side. In 

 addition to this, a broad somewhat crescentic patch occupies the anterior por- 

 tion of the vertex, and descends on the cheeks in front of the eyes nearly or 

 quite to the commissure of the bill, leaving the features' of the extreme 

 front black. The colors in every other respect are those of aequinoctialis. 



More constant and reliable, though not so conspicuous, diagnostic features 

 are to be found in other characters. The b rd is larger than aequinoctialis; 

 its bill is a little longer and considerably more robust, and has the unguis of 

 both mandibles bluish black instead of bright yellow. The sides of the man- 

 dibles are also usually much darker in color. The wings and tail, on an aver- 

 age, exceed those of aequinoctialis by an inch or so, but the variation with 

 individuals of both species amounts to more than this. A corresponding 

 relative difference exists in the average length of the tarsus and toes.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 119 



There are no points of synonymy connected with this species which require 

 notice. 



ADAMASTOR, Bon. 



Char. Gen. Of large size and robust form. Bill a little shorter than the 

 head, about three-fourths the tarsus, broad and stout at the base, narrowing 

 regularly to the strong, very convex compressed unguis. Nasal tubes longer 

 than ordinary (for the Puffinea?) very broad, depressed, but vertically trun- 

 cated at their extremity, and with an unusually thin septum, somewhat as in 

 the Fulmarese, to which the genus bears considerable analogy. Wings rather 

 short for this section ; the primaries broad and stout, the second quite as 

 long as the first. Tail rather short, of twelve feathers ; the central rectrices 

 projecting and a little acuminate ; the lateral more rounded, and rapidly 

 graduated. Feet of the usual size, moderately compressed and stout. Tar- 

 sus shorter than the middle toe without its claw. Outer toe longer than the 

 middle. Tip of outer claw about reaching base of middle. 



The genus Adamastor was founded in 1856 by Bonaparte to accommodate 

 certain Procellaridians, which seem to combine in a remarkable manner the 

 characteristics of both the Fulmarese and the Puffineas. The species resem- 

 ble mo;t the Fulmareae in the length, vertical truncation and thin septum 

 of the nasal tubes ; and also less markedly in the shape of the wings and 

 tail. In all other respects they are, however, true Puffinea?. The bill, in 

 shape and comparative size, can hardly be distinguished from that of Maja- 

 <jneu.s a,equinoctialis, which is one of the Puffinese. The most essential char- 

 acter of the bill of the Fulinareaa is that the outline of the unguis of the lower 

 mandible is about straight and ascending ; that of the Puffinea is very concave 

 and decurved. Adamastor possesses the latter character. Again, the tail of 

 the Fuliuaieas has fourteen (Fnlmarus) or sixteen {ossifraga) rectrices ; the 

 tail of Adamastor but twelve. The large stout feet, too, are those of Shear- 

 waters, and not of Fulmars. From these manifold considerations I think 

 that it is manifest that the proper affinities of the somewhat anomalous 

 genus are decidedly with the Puffiuere, rather than with the Fulmareas, 

 among which Bonaparte has located it. 



It is not a little surprising that so great confusion and uncertainty should 

 have reigned concerning so marked a species as P. cinereus, Gmel, the type 

 of this peculiar genus. On my remarks, infra, upon A. cinereus, and also 

 upon Puffiini* Kuhlii, I hope I have elucidated several vexed questions of 

 synonymy satisfact rily.

Description.* Form typically that of the genus, which see, supra. 

 Color. The nasal tubes, and culmen as far as the unguis, are black ; the 

 unguis is pale yellowish. The sides of the upper mandible, as far as the 

 sulcus which separates them from the culmen, yellow, as are the sides of 

 the lower mandible and its unguis ; the sulcus of the lower mandible and its 

 commissural edge being bluish black. [Compare Fok*t. Deser., p. 208.] 

 Feet in the dried specimen dingy bluish or yellowish green, dusky exteriorly 

 and posteriorly, the webs yellow, the claws light brown, with black tips. 

 Above a uniform cinereous, of much the same shade over the whole upper 

 parts ; some of the feathers, especially the scapulars and tertials, with just 

 appreciably lighter tips ; the crown of the head and the circumocular region 

 a little deeper cinereous than elsewhere. The wing coverts of the specimen in 

 question are interspersed with feathers of a dull brownish rather than cine- 

 reous hue. These are evidently old worn ones, and doubtless indicate that 

 in this species, as in others, the newer aud fresher the feathers the clearer 

 and more decided is the cinereous hue. The color of the upper parts has no 

 line of demarcation with the white of the lower on the sides of tha head and 

 neck. Insensibly fading away, it extends quite around on the chin and 

 throat, but is more restricted on the sides of the neck. The primaries are 

 blackish cinereous on their outer webs and at their tips ; light greyish cine- 

 reous internally and basally ; their shafts are light brown. The inferior sur- 

 faces of the wings, together with the axillary feathers and some feathers on 

 the sides of the body under the wings, are dull brownish cinereous. The 

 tail feathers and the entire under tail coverts, from the anus backwards, are 

 deep blackish or sooty cinereous, the rectrices the darkest. The rest of the 

 under parts are white. 



Dimensions. Length about 19 inches. Bill along culmen 1-80; from. fea- 

 thers on side of lower mandible to its apex 1*50 ; height of bill at base (55 ; 

 width of bill at base '60. Wing from the carpus 1300 ; tail 5*75 ; exterior 

 rectrices 1-25 shorter. Tarsus 2-40 ; middle toe and claw 2-90; outer do. 

 3'00 ; inner do. 2-50. Length of nasal tubes -45, inches and hundredths. 



Bibliography. As I have endeavored to prove, in my discussion of the 

 synonyms of P. Kuhlii (which see), the Proc. cinerea, Ghnelin, is really the 

 present species, and not the common Atlantic bird to which the name cine- 

 reus has been generally applied by European authors. Bonaparte, indeed, 

 was completely convinced of this ; and it is the more singular that he does 

 not adopt Grtnelin's name, but prefers to confer a new specific designation. 

 viz. : typus, in direct violation of one of the most firmly established law- oi 

 nomenclature. To Mr. Gr. N. Lawrence is due the credit of restoring Grine- 

 lin's name to the species to which it rightfully belongs. 



The Proc. hcesitata of Forster is most undoubtedly, I think, the present 

 species. His description is pertinent in every respect ; and his remarks con- 

 cerning the form and color of the bill will apply to no other species. The 

 hcesitata of Gould's Birds of Australia, and of Lawrence, (Ann. New York 

 Lye. Nat. Hist.,) is the same bird. The hcesita'a of Kuhl's Monograph and 

 of TemmiiK k's Blanches Colorees is apparently, however, not this species, 

 but the Astrelata diabolica, Bp. ex L'Herm. 



I quote "P. melanura, Bonn.' 1 on authority of Bonaparte, not having an 

 opportunity of verifying the reference. 



* The accompanying description wa< taken trim a fully mature specimen from the coast of 

 California, off Monterey, kindly furnished for examination by M r. Lawrence. It is the example

The following resume of the points under discussion is given for conve- 

 nience of reference : 



Proc. cinerea, Gm., Lath., Vie-ill. (1817) ; (nee auct. Europ. quae P. Kuhlii, 

 Boie ; nee auct. Anier. quae P. major, Faber) = Puffinus cinereus, Lawrence, 

 1S5S = Adamastor typus, Bp., 1856 = Proc. adamastor, Schlegel, 1803 = 

 Adamastoi cinereus, Coues, 1864. 



Proc. fkesitata, Forst., 1774 = Puff, hcesitata, Lawrence, 1853 = P. hoesitata, 

 Gould (sed non P. hcesitata, Kuhl, 1823, nee Temni. PL Color, quae species 

 Astrelata ) = P. cinereus, Gm. 



Dr. Lichtenstein, in his edition (1844) of Forster's Descriptiones Anima- 

 lium, says that the leucocephala of Forster (which is also the alba of Linn., 

 Gm., Lath.) " vix nisi Estate videtur differre a hcesitata Forster." It is well 

 known that the present species when young has the cinereous of the head 

 much lighter than that of the adults ; and Prof. Lichtenstein's surmise may 

 therefore be correct. As, however, there are several points of form, etc., in 

 which it seems to differ from hcesitata, and especially as Bonaparte has con- 

 sidered it a valid species of Astrelata, I shall follow the latter authority until 

 more definite data may be found upon the subject.

Sj). char. " Feathers of the head and all the upper surface brown, with 

 paler edges, fading into white on the tips of the upper tail coverts ; wings 

 and tail deep blackish brown ; all the under surface pure white ; the feathers 

 of the under surfaces of the shoulders with a streak of brown down the 

 centre ; bill yellow, passing into dark horn color at the tip ; tarsi and feet 

 fleshy white. 



"Length 19 inches ; bill 2| ; wing 15 ; tail 6^ ; tarsi 2| ; middle toe and 

 claw 3^.'' [Gould.] 



This is an exceedingly well marked species, liable to be confounded with 

 no other with which I am acquainted. That it is a species of Adamastor, 

 and entirely congeneric with A. cinereus, there can be, I think, no doubt. 

 The general coloration and the proportions as indicated by the measurements, 

 plainly evince this to be the case. Moreover, Mr. Gould himself remarks 

 that " this bird so nearly approaches in form the members of the genus Puf- 

 finus, that it is almost a question whether it should not be included in that 

 genus." A bird which could be placed by so accurate an ornithologist as 

 Mr. Gould in the genus Procellaria (/. e. among the Fulmareae), and which 

 yet exhibits such an affinity with the Puffineas, cannot but belong to the genus 

 Adamastor. 



Discussion of synonymy. I think there can be no reasonable doubt that the 

 old P. gelida of Gmelin, Latham and Vieillot is really the present species. 

 The habitat and the dimensions given by these authors is the same as that 

 assigned to Jlavirostris by Mr. Gould ; and their diagnoses are pertinent in 

 almost every particular. The expression " pedibus caeruleis" is indeed 

 quite inadmissible ; but a misinterpretation of the color of the feet of birds 

 of this family is extremely likely to occur when only dried skins are exa- 

 mined. Still I would hardly venture to supersede Gould's Jlavirostris by 

 Guielin'-- or Latham's gelida, were it not for the fuller and more perfect de- 

 scription of the species given by Vieillot in the work above quoted. An 

 examination of his description will show that it differs in no single conse-

quential point.* In view of these facts, and deeming it of the utmost im- 

 portance to identify as many of the names of the older authors as possible, I 

 have thought it best to restore Gmelin's appellation.

Habitat. Southern Pacific Ocean. 



Sp. char. Bill black; feet flesh-colored, the margins of the webs blackish. 

 Upper parts deep greyish ashy, passing into blackish grey on the upper wing 

 coverts. Head, neck and under parts white ; the former variegated with 

 some touches of clear greyish ash. Circumocular region blackish. Inferior 

 surfaces of the wings of a lighter color than the superior. Tail rounded, its 

 upper surface lightly washed with ashy.

 5 ; bill along gape 2-00 ; nasal tubes - 40 ; tarsus 1*75 ; middle toe 1*33. 



The preceding description is compiled from Lesson's original notice. The 

 indications are not as explicit as might be desired ; but I think that there can 

 be no doubt of the propriety of Bonaparte's referring the species to his genus 

 Adamastor. The pattern of coloration is rather that of most of the species 

 of Astrelata ; but the proportions as indicated by Lesson's measurements in- 

 dicate a bird congeneric with Adamastor cinereus. 



I have met with no synonyms of this species requiring notice.

Char. Bill long and slender, about three-fourths the tarsus, compressed,

 wing from the carpus, very much graduated. Tarsus a fourth longer than 

 the bill, moderately stout, compressed. Middle toe without a claw, a little 

 longer than the tarsus. Of moderate size, rather slender form and uniformly 

 fuliginous colors. 



The most essential character of the genus is found in its unusually elon- 

 gated and much graduated tail. In all other respects it hardly diners at all 

 from Nectris ; and its species have all the same fuliginous hue that charac- 

 terises the latter genus. 



Two species are recognized by ornithologists as belonging to this genus. 

 Though exceedingly closely allied to each other, j-et they seem to constantly 

 differ in some applicable points.

A fine series of these species is in the collection of the Philadelphia Acade- 

 my. The general color of the plumage is a deep chocolate brown, or dark 

 reddish black, most of the feathers of the upper parts with paler margins. 

 The color of the back deepens into pure black on the wings and tail. Below, 

 the general plumage is of a deep brown, with a wash of grey, the brown 

 tinge most palpable on the abdomen, the grey predominating on the throat. 



* I may remark, en passant, that the expression " pres de huit ponces de longueur totale" is 



most probably a typographical error, or a lapsus calami. It was etideutly iuteuded to be " dix

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 12S 



The bill is flesh color, tinged with brown ; much darker along the culmen 

 and on the unguis ; the legs and feet are flesh eolored, with a tinge of yellow. 



This species measures from 15 to 16 inches in total length ; the wing from the 

 carpus 10-f)0 to 11*25. The tail varies somewhat in length, from nearly five 

 to quite six inches ; the graduation of the lateral feathers usually being about 

 2 inches. Bill about 1-60; height at base 35, width *50 ; length of nasal 

 tubes -25. Tarsus 1*90 middle toe and c'aw 2*35. 



This species can be confounded with no other, (except, perhaps, T. chloro- 

 rhynchus, which see ;) and there are no involved points of synonymy.

Almost identical with T. sphenurus in the color of the plumage ; and with 

 much the same dimensions. The main diagnostic points seem to be the fol- 

 lowing : The bill is of a greenish orange color, except along the culmen and 

 at the tip, where it is black. The bill is longer than that of sphenurus by 

 about a fourth of an inch on the average, and appears a little larger at the 

 base, though quite slender in its continuity, "While chlororhynchus is, upon 

 the whole, a larger bird than sphenurus, nevertheless the wings are abso- 

 lutely s barter (h an inch or more) on an average. The feet are slightly 

 longer and stouter. In color the present species differs slightly in being 

 rather more cinereous below ; but the difference is not well marked. 



The species not as yet a well known one, nor contained in many mussea. 



NECTRIS Bp. (emend, ex Forst.) 



Char. Generally similar to Puffinus ; colors uniformly fuliginous ; bill and 

 feet wholly or partially light colored. Bill long and slender, much hooked at 

 the tip ; nasal tubes short, broad, depressed, very obliquely truncated, the 

 septum broad, the nostrils narrowly oval. Wings reaching a little beyond 

 the tail, which varies in length, but is always more or less rounded. Feet 

 moderate ; tarsus about equal to middle toe without claw ; outer toe without 

 claw equal to middle ; tip of inner claw not reaching base of middle one. 



This genus comprises five, perhaps six, species, all agreeing in the uniform 

 fuliginous of their plumage, and in the partial or entire paleness of the bill 

 and feet. In form it hardly differs from Puffinus, and its retention as a valid 

 genus is perhaps questionable, except as a matter of convenience in a group 

 where it is of importance to distribute the numerous closely-allied species in 

 as many groups as may be at all characterizable.

 brownish black, the internal face of the tarsnsand the interdigital membranes

 middle toe about 2*50. 



This species is too well known to require farther characterization. 



Discussion of synonymy. The name li fuliginosus^ has unfortunately been 

 almost as badly bandied about as has cinereus, Gm. Thus the full ginosus, 

 Sin., Lath., apparently (and it is so looked upon by most ornithologists,) be- 

 longs to a species of the genus Thalassidroma, Vig., from Otaheite, probably 

 not very widely differing from the Cymochorea melanin, mihi, ex Bp. Fuligi- 

 nosa, Banks, (tab. 19.) kuhl, (sp. 12, pi, x. fig. 6,) is a species subsequently 

 called atlantica by Gould, now the Pterodroma atlantica, Bp. Exactly what is 

 the fuliginosa, Forster, (Descr. p. 23, sp. IS), is a little doubtful. His editor, 

 Lichtenstein, says that it is the same asfiliginosa, Kuhl, sp. 12; and this 

 opinion is also maintained by Bonaparte, which would make it the Pterodroma 

 atlantica. But then, on the contrary, Dr Kuhl asserts positively that his 

 species 12 is " omnino diversa a Nectri fuliginosa, Forst." For my own part, 

 after carefully studying Forster's description, I am inclined to coincide with 

 Dr. Kuhl, and to hold that Forster's fuliginosa is not the Pterodroma atlantica, 

 but rather a pacific species of the genus Nectris. 



Species 27 of Kuhl's monograph, also called fuliginosa (after Banks, tab. 23) , 

 is too indefinite for me to make anything of it. 



No other synonyms of this species seem to require notice. The confounding 

 of this species with carneipes, Gould, by Dr. Schlegel, will be noticed uuder 

 the head of the latter.

Description. Form. Bill about as long as the head, a little shorter than 

 the tarsus, about two-thirds the middle toe and claw ; rather slender, attenu- 

 ated, compressed, except at base', where it is as wide as high ; the unguis 

 large, and much hooked; commissure much curved from base to unguis; 

 outline of rami of inferior mandible quite straight. Nasal tubes rather more 

 than a fourth the length of the culmen, broad, but much depressed, with an 

 indistinct median longitudinal groove ; terminally exceedingly obliquely trun- 

 cated ; the nostrils oval. The feathers of the front form a very obtuse angle 

 on the culmen, but instead of immediately retreating on either side, they ex- 

 tend forwards again on the sides of the upper mandible, nearly as far as on the 

 culmen. Wings of ordinary length and shape. Tail rather long, contained 

 only 2i times in the wing from the carpus ; much rounded, as usual in the 

 genus." Feet moderately stout ; tarsus just equal to the middle toe without 

 its claw; outer toe without its claw longer than the middle; inner toe un- 

 usually abbreviated, the tip of its claw falling J of an inch short of the base 

 of the middle claw. 



Co/or. The bill is wholly deep brownish black ; somewhat lighter on the 

 sides of the lower mandible ; the extremity of both ungues horn colored. The 

 inner aspect of the tarsus, the middle and inner toes, the whole of the webs, 

 and the bases of the claws, clear light yellowish flesh color ; the outer aspect 

 of the tarsus, the outer toe, and tips of the claws, the same color, but much 

 tinged with brown. The shade of the upper parts is a pure deep chocolate 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 125 



brown , without the slightest tinge of ashy; a little darker on the rump, so dark 

 as to be brownish black on the wing coverts and tertials ; the extreme tips of 

 which latter are somewhat paler. The primaries are lustrous brownish black 

 on their outer webs and at their tips ; and their inner webs are but little 

 paler ; their shafts are on their superior aspect black, becoming brownish ba- 

 sally ; their inferior aspects also black, but with a delicate white line running 

 medianly two-thirds their whole length. The rectrices are colored like the 

 primaries ; their shafts are brownish black. The entire under wing coverts 

 are white ; the purity and continuity of which is, however, interrupted by 

 some grayish brown marbling. The under parts generally are much lighter 

 thau the upper, and of a grayish rather than brownish fuliginous, this color 

 passing on the throat and chin gradually into a somewhat grayish cinereous 

 hue. The short anterior under tail coverts are light grayish brown ; the loug 

 posterior ones are more of a brownish fuliginous. There is a delicate touch of 

 white on the under eyelid. 



Dimensions. Length of bill along culmen 1-70; from feathers on side of 

 lower mandible to its top, 1'60 ; length of nasal tubes, -45 ; height of bill at 

 base, -45 ; width about the same. Wing, from the carpus, 11-00 ; tail, 4-25 ; 

 graduation of lateral rectrices, *90 ; tarsus, 2-00 ; middle toe and claw, 2-40 ; 

 outer do., 2 30 ; inner do., 1"90. 



It may seem somewhat improbable that a species of Nectris has remained to 

 this late day undescribed ; but the subject of the present article differs in so 

 many particulars from any known bird of the genus, that I have not the 

 slightest hesitation in presenting it as new. It is most closely allied to fuli- 

 ginosa, Strickl., but differs from it, as well as from carneipes and tenuirostris, 

 in many very tangible points. The combination of the wholly dark bill, with 

 the coloration of the feet, as above described, the white on the under surfaces 

 of the wings, together with its own particular dimensions, readily character- 

 ize it among its congeners. The following detailed comparison of it with each 

 may serve to define its relationships more explicitly. 



With the general colors of fuliginosus, especially as regards the wholly 

 dark bill, it differs in the conspicuous white under wing coverts, only a little 

 obscured by grayish brown, and in the different tints and pattern of the feet. 

 (Compare original descriptions of each species.) It is much smaller than that 

 species, to wit: the length about fifteen inches, (as near as I can judge from 

 the skin,) instead of eighteen ; the tarsus barely two inches, instead of two 

 and a quarter ; the toes less in proportion ; and the wing eleven, instead of 

 twelve inches. 



It is more nearly of the same size as carneipes, but in that species the 

 "whole of the plumage is chocolate black;" the bill is flesh colored, except 

 on the culmen and at the tip, whereas in my bird it is wholly dark. The feet 

 of car in ipes are wholly " yellowish flesh color," while in amaurosoma the ex- 

 ternal aspect of the tarsus and the outer toe are brownish white. 



The species hardly requires any comparison with tenuirostris or brevicauda, 

 the notable differences of color alone, or of dimensions alone, at once separa- 

 ting them. The bill of amaurosoma measures about 1'70 inches; that of 

 tenuiros ris 1*20 ; the wing 11, instead of 10 inches ; the tail 4*75 to 5 "00, in- 

 stead of 350, etc. The general color of tenuirostris is a deep smoky black, 

 with a tinge of ashy ; that of amaurosoma brownish fuliginous. Compare also 

 the descriptions given in this paper of the colors of the bill and feet. There 

 is just about the same amount of whitish on the under surfaces of the wings 

 of the two species. 



The type of this species, now in the Smithsonian collection, was procured by 

 Mr. John Xantus at Cape St. Lucas, Lower California, August 18th, 1^60. It 

 is there apparently the representative of fuliginosus, as my opisthomelas is of 

 obscurus.

 tralia; and breeding on the small islands off Cape Leeuwin." [Gould.] 



This species is quite closely allied to fuliginosus, but differs from it by ex- 

 ceedingly well marked characters. The plumage is much the some in both 

 species, 'but the bill of carneipes is " fleshy white, the culmen and tips of the 

 mandibles brown ; the legs, feet, and membranes, yellowish flesh-color." Be- 

 sides these differences in color, there appear to be equally marked discre- 

 pancies in proportions ; thus, vihi\e fuliginosus is eighteen inches long, and 

 carneipes only fifteen, the absolute lengths of the bill, feet, and wings is very 

 nearly the same. (Compare original descriptions by Strickland and Gould.) 

 I have never seen any example so small as the one whose measurements are 

 given by Dr. Schlegel, p. 26 of his monograph, but the limits within which 

 any species of this family may vary are very great. But even granting for a 

 moment the identity of the two species, I do not see upon what authority Dr. 

 Schlegel has given the name carneipes of 1844 priority over fuliginosus of 

 1832. 



Bonaparte, in his Conspectus, has a species N. gama, from South Africa, 

 with which he considers Puff, cinereus, juv., Smith, as synonymous. I have 

 never had an opportunity of examining a specimen professing to be of this 

 species ; but as the diagnosis scarcely shows tangible points of difference, and 

 as Dr. Schlegel is convinced of its identity with carneipes, I shall, for the 

 present at least, follow his authority in assigning it as a synonym of that 

 species. 



An excellent suite of specimens of carneipes is in the collection of the Phila- 

 delphia Academy.

I have before me a typical example of this marked species, from Niphon, 

 agreeing in every respect with the types of the species as described by Schle- 

 gel- 



The most peculiar character of form of this species is found in the shape ol 

 the bill. It is stout at the base, where it is a little broader than high, but 

 rapidly becomes both compressed and depressed, tapering to a small, weak, 

 only moderately hooked unguis. This unusually weak bill is also short, be- 

 ing much less than the head, and only about two-thirds the tarsus. The nostrils 

 measure about a third the length of the culmen. The commissure and out- 

 line of the inferior mandibular rami are both nearly perfectly straight. The 

 wings are very long, reaching much beyond the rest ; the primaries are all 

 tapering and acute. The tail is exceedingly short, its length being contained 

 nearly three times in the wing from the carpus, the central retrices projecting 

 a little, the lateral rapidly graduated. The feet are moderately laaye and 



[April, 




I 



NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 127 



Stout ; the tarsus is about equal to the middle toe without its claw ; the outer 

 toe and claw are equal in length to the middle toe and claw ; the tip of the 

 inner claw falls short of the base of the middle. 



Bill mostly dusky greenish yellow, brighter along the commissure and at 

 tip. Feet yellowish on the anterior, exterior and internal aspect of the tarsus 

 and toes, and the superior surfaces of the webs, the posterior edge of the tar- 

 sus, and the under "surface of the webs blackish. Above very deep sooty 

 black, becoming pure black on the rectrices and outer webs of the primaries, 

 with a just appreciable ashy nuance on the wing coverts. Inner webs of 

 nimaries (except at their tips) and the under surfaces of the wings generally 

 ight dull grayish brown. Shaft of primaries black, except along a groove on 

 their under surfaces, which is yellowish. Beneath, the whole body is of _ a 

 rather light fuliginous or brownish grey, fading, on the throat, (especially in 

 more immature birds) almost into greyish white. The under tail coverts, 

 however, are nearly as dark as the upper parts, only rather more fuliginous. 



Dimensions. Wing from the carpus 10-00 inches : central tail feathers 3*50 ; 

 lateral 2-7- r > : bill along culmen 1-20 ; depth at base -30 ; widih at base -40 ; 

 tarsus 1*90 ; middle toe and claw 2-25 ; outer toe and claw the same ; inner 

 toe and claw just equal to the tarsus. 



This strongly marked species is distinguished from all its congeners by its 

 small size, weak, peculiarly shaped bill, very short tail, and peculiarly 

 colored feet, The difference in intensity between the colors of upper and 

 under parts are quite appreciable. 



Synonymy. The proper name of this species is a matter of no uncertainty, 

 but what designations are to be referred to it as synonyms is more doubtful. 

 Both Bonaparte and Schlegel place " curilicus, Pennant," of the museums of 

 Europe, as a synonym, which is merely, however, saying that certain muse- 

 ums have called tenuirostris, " curilicus, '' and does not in the least affect the 

 question as to whether curilicus be properly a synonym. I am inclined to 

 think that it is not, but that it is rather to be referred to another and larger 

 species of this fuliginous genus. 



Bonaparte and Schlegel both consider " tristis, Forster, Descr. p. 205," as 

 synonymous with this species. It is difficult to sav whether such is oris not 

 the case ; but my own impression, derived from a careful study of the charac- 

 ters laid down by Forster, is that his tristis refers to a species much larger, 

 and with a stouter bill than the present ; possibly the true curilicus, Penn.

This is a species with which I am autoptically unacquainted, nor have I ac-

 able to discuss its characters and relationships. By Dr. Schlegel it is placed 

 as a synonym, with a query of N. tenuirostris, but other authors all agree in 

 considering it as a valid species.

 surpassing the tail, which is lengthened and more or less rounded, of twelve

The genus Puffinus, as characterized in the above paragraph, comprises nu- 

 merous bicolor species, spread all over the world. They form two groups. 

 Those of the first group are large, with robust bills, and have the upper plum- 

 age brown or cinereous. They are major, leucomelas, Kuhlii and creatopus, 

 which compose the " genus" Ardenna, Reich. The species of the second group 

 are all much smaller, with very slender, weak bills, and the upper parts blackish 

 or greyish black. They are anglorum, yelcuanus, obscurus, opisthomelas and 

 nvtgax, forming the restricted " subgenus " Puffinus.

 Discussion of Synonymy. There is in the Atlantic Ocean a very common 

 and well known Procellaridian, to wit, the " cinereous Shearwater, " a bird 

 about the size of Puffinus major, Faber, but otherwise quite distinct from it in 

 form, color, etc. This bird was named Procellaria Kuhlii by Prof. Boie, in 

 183">. (Isis von Oken, p. 257, sp. 25, which consult.) From Boie's excellent 

 characterization, and from the very marked distinctive features of the bird 

 itself, there need have been no confusion or uncertainty regarding it. But 

 before 1835, so common and well known was the bird, that it had been noticed 

 by numerous other writers, and unfortunately most of them had erroneously 

 applied to it Gmelin's name cinerea ; while others had with equal inaccuracy 

 called it P. puffinus, Linupens. When more recently C. L. Bonaparte at- 

 tempted to show that " cinereus, Gm., Lath.," was not the common Atlantic 

 bird at all, but a Pacific species, (described as P. hacsitata by F. ster) and 

 properly the type of a genus (viz., Adamastor, Bp.) distinct from Puffinus ; 

 the assertion was illy received by ornithologists, and the general confusion 

 rather augmented than diminished. To the following attempt to unravel the 

 knotty points of synonymy involved, I would invite the particular attention 

 of ornithologists, as I hope to be able to sustain the position assumed by 

 Bonaparte. 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 12l> 



The following is Gmelin's diagnosis, in copying which the italics are my 

 own : S. N. i. pars ii. p. 563, sp. 17. "Pr. cinerea, suhtus alba, cauda nigra, 

 rostro flavicante, pedibus ccerulescentibus. " Cinereous Fulmar," Latham, 

 Syn. iii. p 405, No. 10. Habitat intra circulum antarcticum ; glacialis magni- 

 tudine : 20i pollices longa." It will be noticed that Gmelin's bird is one from 

 the Antarctic seas, as large as the common Fulmar, and with exactly the 

 characters of the bird afterwards designated as Adaviastor typus by Bonaparte. 

 Gmelin's further description will be found to confirm this opinion by each of 

 its sentences. I do not see, therefore, how it is possible to consider it as re- 

 ferring to a North Atlantic species, with characters so very different as are 

 those presented by P. Kuhlii, Boie. 



The Proc. cinerea, Lath., Ind. Ornith., ii. 1790, p. 824, and the Proc. cine- 

 rea, Vieillot, Nouv. Diet. D'H. N. 1817, xxv, p. 418, are both exactly the 

 same as Gmelin's cinerea, and so is the Puffinus cinereus of Lawrence, Bds. 

 N. A., 1858, p. 835, from the Pacific Ocean, under which head the synonyms 

 of Adamastor typus are accurately enumerated. 



The above is all that is necessary to be said, I think, to substantiate Bona- 

 parte's position, that P. cinereus, dm., is not the Atlantic bird afterwards 

 named Kuhlii by Boie. The subject will be resumed and the generic and 

 specific characters of Adamastor typus, as distinguished from those of Puffinus 

 Kuhlii, will be enlarged upori in another place. It now only remains to dis- 

 cuss the various synonyms of Kuhlii. 



The first instance of the misapplication of Gmelin's name, cinereus, which I 

 have been able to find, is that by Cuvier, when he calls P. Kuhlii "P. cine- 

 reus." This same malidentification has also been committed by Bonaparte, 

 (Comp. List, Bds. N. A. and Eur., 1838, p. (14.) Degland, (Ornith. Europ., 

 1849, ii. p. 362;) Temminck, (Man. Orn., iv. 1840, p. 506; Schinz,) (Europ. 

 Faun., 1840. i. p. 393;) Schlegel, (Rev. Crit. Ois. Eur., 1844, p. 132;) Key- 

 serling and Blasius, (Wirb. Europ., 1840, p. 94.) 



The Puffinus cinereus of Bonaparte (Synop. Bds. N. A., 1S28 : p. 370,) of 

 Nuttall, (Man. Ornith., ii. p. 334,) and of Audubon's works, (Orn. Biogr. vol. 

 iii. p. 555 ; Bds. N. Amer., vii. 1844, p. 212, pi. 456,) is, however, not the/'. 

 Kuhlii but the P. major, Faber. 



"The Procellaria puffinus, L.," of Temminck, (Man. Orn. 1820, ii. p, 805;) 

 and of Vieillot, (Fauna Frant;, 1828, p. 404) are synonyms of P. Kuhlii. 



Yet another improper reference of Gmelin's cin. n us is found in Degland's Or- 

 nithologie Europeene, where it is placed as a synonym (with a query, how- 

 ever,) of P. major, Faber. This is just the mistake which has been generally 

 committed by American Authors. 



I am enabled to state positively, from autoptical examination of the speci- 

 mens themselves, that the bird referred to by Cassin, in the Proceedings of 

 the Philadelphia Academy for Jane, 1862, page 327, as Puffinus Kuhlii, is 

 really the Adamastor cinereus, Mihi. The specimens, three in number, col- 

 lected by the North Pacific Exploring Expedition, are lying before me, and 

 agree in the minutest particulars with the type specimen of Lawrence's P. 

 hassitata, (Ann. N. Y., Lye. N. II., 1853) which is also Lawrence's P. cinereus 

 (Birds Amer., 1858, p. 835,) which is Adamas ; or typus, Bp. 



Description. In general form not unlike P. major, but rather more grace- 

 ful, with slightly slenderer and weaker bill, comparatively longer wings and 

 tail, etc. Bill scarcely if at all shorter than the head, just equal to the tar- 

 sus, moderately stout, compressed, higher than broad at the base ; unguis 

 only moderately strong and hooked ; commissure and outline of inferior man- 

 dibular rami a little curved, the former most so ; nasal tubes unusually ab- 

 breviated, measuring not over a fifth of the culmen, but elevated, inflated, 

 medianly suboarinate, apically obliquely truncated, the nostrils subcircular 

 in outline ; wings moderately long, a little exceeding the tail ; tail quite long, 

 so much rounded as to be almost cuneiform, the central rectrices mucheloug-

ated ; feet rather weak and slender, moderately compressed ; tarsus shorter 

 than the middle toe without the claw ; outer toe and claw longer than the 

 middle with its claw, tip of inner claw about reaching base of middle one ; 

 claws obtuse, little arched, more or less dilated on their inner edge. 



Colors. The upper parts are of a light smoky gray, or very light brownish 

 ash color, this color uniform ou the crown and nape, interrupted on the back 

 by the pare or grayish white margins of all the feathers, which margins are 

 broadest on the scapulars, deepening on the wing coverts and tertials into deep 

 grayish brown, and also losing the white margins. The rump is concolor 

 with the rest of the back, but the upper tail coverts have successively more 

 and more white until the longest and most posterior ones are almost wholly of 

 this color, with only some central touches of grayish brown. The primaries 

 are deep grayish or brownish black, with, however, large white spaces which, 

 occupy the basal half or two-thirds of their inner webs. The outer webs, and 

 apices of the secondaries are deep grayish plumbeous ; the greater part of 

 their inner webs white. The entire parts of the bird, from the chin to the 

 extreme tips of the under tail coverts are pure white, except some slight 

 soupgons of grayish on the flanks. The under surfaces of the wings, except 

 just along the edges, and the axillary feathers are pure white. The connec- 

 tion of the color of the upper parts with the white of the under, on the sides of 

 the head and neck, is peculiar ; there is no line of demarcation whatever, but 

 as the color of the upper parts becomes lighter in tint, so it becomes gradually 

 more and more nebulated and undulated with white, the admixture of the 

 two having a marked and beautiful effect. The under eyelid is wholly white, 

 the upper less completely so. The bill is yellowish, darker along the culmen, 

 the unguis light horn color. The legs and feet are yellowish, the webs still 

 clearer yellow ; the claws flesh colored. 



Dimensions. Length of bill along culmen 1*90, along gape 2-60, from feath- 

 ers on side of lower mandible to its apex 1*75 ; height at base "70 ; width -60 ; 

 tarsus 1 90 ; middle toe and claw 2-50, outer do. 2-55, inner do. 2-50 ; wing 

 from the carpus 12-75 ; central rectrices 5-50, exterior do 4-75. 



The variations in size to which this species is subject, are entirely parallel 

 with those of P major, detailed further on. The color of adult birds does 

 not vary much, and that chiefly in the slightly different degree of clearness 

 or obscurity of the upper parts. Younger birds, however, have the bill 

 rather dusky than yellowish, and somewhat of a greenish or bluish tinge in 

 the color of the feet. The upper parts are considerably darker than those of 

 the adults, being rather more of a brownish plumbeous than of an ashy gray- 

 ish tint.

With this species I am autoptically unacquainted, and therefore compile 



the following brief account from Dr. Schlegel's excellent Monograph, above 



quoted. 



It is in general similar to P. Kuhlii^ which it appears to replace in the 

 Pacific Ocean. It is smaller, however, than that species, slenderer in 

 general prorortions, and with a weaker bill. In color it is principally distin- 

 guished by having the feathers of the upper parts generally, and of the sides 

 of the head and neck white, each with a brown longitudinal shaft line. 



Length of wing from the carpus from 11| to 12 inches. Middle tail feath- 

 ers 4^ to 4i| inches, external 3 to 3.}. Bill 22 to 23 Hues ; height at base 5 

 to 6 fines ; width about the same. Nasal tubes 3} lines. Tarsus 21 lines ; 

 .middle toe 23 to 25 lines. 



Habitat. Pacific ocean, particularly in vicinity of Japan.

 ex insula "San Nicholas " prope California, a Chirurgio J. Gr. Cuopero col- 

 lectum. (Calend Julii A. D. mdccclxiii.) 



Description. Form: Bill a little shorter than the head or tarsus, abont 

 two-thirds the middle toe and claw ; the most robust of the Puffinf-ae, being 

 especially large and swollen at the base, where it is as wide as high. The 

 culmen rises rapidly from the end of the nasal tubes to the strong, very con- 

 vex and much curved unguis ; the sides of the bill are considerably com- 

 pressed beyond the nostrils. Co - iimissure curved from the feathers to the un- 

 guis, the convexity looking downwards ; outline of the inferior mandibular 

 rami about straight. The basal tubes are very short, being hardly a fourth of 

 the length of culmen; they are unusua'ly elevated, turgid, and with a slight 

 median furrow ; very obliquely terminated ; the nares are elliptical in outline. 

 The feathers of the forhead run forward to form an acute angle on the me- 

 dian line. The tarsi are unusually weak and slender, though not very much com- 

 pressed, and are shorter than the middle toe without the claw. The outer toe 

 just barely exceeds the middle, but its claw is much shorter and weaker. The 

 tip of the inner claw falls short of the base of the middle one. The wings are 

 of the ordinary shape and dimensions, and have the usual proportionate length 

 of the primaries. The tail is of nrich the same length and has the same amount 

 of graduation of its lateral rectrices as in P. major. 



Color. The upper parts are of about the same shade of brown as in P. 

 major, and the feathers have similar lighter margins, the head, however, 

 having more decidedly a plumbeous cast. The upper tail coverts are entirely 

 deep broWnish-black, darker even than the rest of the upper parts, with no 

 vestige of white. The inner webs of the primaries are entirely brownish- 

 black to their very bases, with no indication of the white spaces which exist 

 in P. major. On the sides of the head and neck, the color of the upper parts 

 extends entirely round on to the chin and throat, having no distinct line of 

 demarcation, but very gradually and insensibly becoming more and more 

 mottled with white, until the latter becomes the predominating color ; on the 

 chin the plumbeous-black and the white are about equal in amouut. The 

 dark color does not extend further nor indeed so far on the sides of the breast 

 as on the sides of the neck. The lower eyelid is pure white. The sides under the 

 wings and the inferior surfaces of the wings are mottled with grayish-black 

 and white in about equal amount. The long axillary feathers are entirely gray- 

 ish-black, except just at their bases. The middle of the abdomen and the 

 circumanal region are variegated with grayish-black and white. The under 

 tail coverts are entirely fuliginous black, with somewhat of a grayish cast. 

 The nasal tubes, the culmen and unguis of the bill are brownish-black ; the 

 rest of the bill light-yellowish flesh color. The legs and feet are entirely 

 light flesh color. The claws are whitish with brown tips. 



Dimensions. "Length 19-OJ; extent of wings 45 - 00" (collector's label.) 

 Bill along culmen 1-60; along gape 2*30; from feathers on side of lower

132 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



most of its features, that it intimately resembles no other with which I am 

 acquainted. It may he well, however, to notice the points of difference be- 

 tween it and P. major which is the most_ nearly allied species. There is but 

 little difference in size between the two birds, creatopus being only slightly 

 smaller, and the color of the upper parts is about the same in each. Creatopus 

 may be at once recognized as follows : by its much shorter, stouter bill, usu- 

 ally turgid and thick at the base, with its very short swollen nasal tubes, and 

 light flesh-color, except along the culmen and unguis; by its shorter, slen- 

 derer flesh-colored feet ; by its entirely brownish-black upper tail coverts ; by 

 the extension of the dark color of the sides of the head and neck, far round on 

 the chin and throat without any distinct line of demarcation ; by the absence of 

 any white at the bases of the primaries, and by the unusual amount of gray- 

 ish-black mottling on the sides, the under surfaces of the wings, the axillary 

 feathers, and circumanal region. 



The shape of the bill is more like that of.the common Atlantic Kuhlii ; and 

 the nasal tubes are quite as short. But the bill of creatopus is much stouter, 

 wider and more turgid at the base, and the unguis is much more rapidly de- 

 curved. The color is quite different, (compare descriptions.) The legs of 

 cinereus are yellow ; of creatopus light flesh-color. The differences in plum- 

 age are too obvious to require comparison ; e. g. cinereus has pure white 

 under tail coverts ; creatopus brownish-black, etc. 



I have been unable to find any description which can be considered as in- 

 dicative of this species, which I believe to be hitherto quite unknown. It is 

 exceedingly interesting, from its many peculiarities of form and color. It is 

 particularly to be noted, that it is the only "bicolor " species, that is, dark 

 colored above and mostly white beneath, which has flesh-colored legs ; this 

 coloration of the legs being hitherto only known to its extent among the fuligi- 

 nous species composing the subgenus Nectris. 



The type and only known specimen of the species was taken by Dr. J. G. 

 Cooper, at San Nicholas Island, off the coast of California. Its precise range 

 of habitat is as yet unknown. Accompanying the specimen was a note from 

 Dr. Cooper, stating that it was a species unknown to him and probably new, 

 and suggesting, in the latter event, the exceedingly appropriate name by which 

 I have designated it.

Synonymy. This species has been presented under a variety of designa- 

 tions. Some authors have thought with Kuhl, that it is the one referred to 

 by Linnaeus, Gmelin and Latham, under the name of Procellaria puffinus. Else- 

 where, however, I have proven, I think, that such is not the case, but that 

 P. puffinus, Linn., is a synonym of P. anglorum Ray. 



The Procellaria puffinus of Temminck (loc. cit.) is not this species, nor yet 

 the anglorum (although he presents it as the real L'nnsean P. puffinus ;) but 

 on the contrary, it, is the P. Kuhlii, Boie, as is evident from the description and 

 the synonyms quoted. I am quite at a loss however, to discover upon what 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



grounds Tcmminck asserts that the P. puffinus, Kuhl., and the P. cinerea 

 Kuhl, are " le vieux et le jeune de la mime espC-ce." Kuhl's descriptions 

 certainly indicate the two different species ; and his passable figures of their 

 heads are distinct enough from each other. But if Temminck could stoutly 

 maintain to the last that P. fuliginosus. Strickl., was the female oiP. major, 

 Fab. (!), it is the less to be wondered at that he should commit the error we 

 are now discussing. 



It is a little doubtful what species is referred to by Vieillot, Nouv. Diet. 

 d'H. N. xxv, 1817, p. 421, under the name of " Le Petrel-puffin, Procellaria 

 puffinus, Lath." The dimensions given ("quinze pouees ") appertain best to 

 the anglorum ; but the. description is entirely that of the P. Kuklii, which it 

 is doubtless best to consider it. The Procellaria pyffinus of Vieillot's Fauna 

 Frau'j. 1S2S, p. 404, is undoubtedly the true cinereits. 



Dr. Degland in his Ornithologie Europeene, p. 3G3, gives a good description 

 of this species under its proper name of Puff, major, but he is in error in 

 citing as synonyms the Puffinus cinereus, Brisson, or the Procellaria cinerea 

 Ginelin and Latham. 



Description. Form: Bill but very little shorter than the head or tarsus, 

 stout and subterete at the bas% then gradually more and more compressed to 

 the strong, deep, much curved unguis. Nasal tubes straight, about a fourth 

 the length of the culmen, somewhat dilated, the apertures widely separated, 

 sub-elliptical. The culmen rises gradually with a slight but continuous 

 concavity from the nostrils to the summit of the unguis. The commissure 

 from the insertion of the feathers to the declination of the unguis is a long 

 regular curve, whose convexity looks downwards. The outline of the inferior 

 mandibular rami is nearly straight. The bill is about three times as long as it 

 is high at the base, considerably less wide than high. The primaries are long, 

 somewhat narrow, rather acutely pointed, the first longest, the second 

 nearly equal, the rest rapidly graduated. The tail is long, being contained 

 only about two and a third times in the wing from the carpus ; so much 

 rounded as to be almost cuneiform ; the central rectrices projecting consid- 

 erably, and the lateral being much abbreviated. The tarsus is as long as the 

 middle toe alone, compressed as usual, but very stout and strong. The 

 outer toe is as long or slightly longer than the middle, but the small size of 

 its claw makes it fall short of the tip of the middle claw. The inner toe is 

 unnsually abbreviated, the tip of its claw falling far short of the base of the 

 middle one. 



Color. Upper parts dark bistre brown ; on the head inclining a little to 

 plumbeous or grayish brown ; on the tertials and rump the deepest ; each 

 feather of the back, rump, and wing coverts with a margin of lighter brown, 

 which in freshly plumaged birds is so light as to be almost ashy white ; on 

 the head the color is uniform without any lighter margins, and it extends 

 considerably below the eyes, just to the level of the gape, having a clear and 

 distinct line of demarcation with the white of the throat. Posteriorly on the 

 side of the neck the white reaches further round on the nape, and has a 

 more indefinite outline. Backwards still on the sides of the breast, the dark 

 color reaches farther down, encroaching on the white of that region. The 

 upper tail coverts, especially the longest and most posterior ones, are mostly 

 white, but with transverse rays or central spaces of brown. The primaries 

 are brownish black, deepest on their outer webs ; on their inner webs, towards 

 their bases, gradually lightening till they become brownish white, or even 

 nearly pure white, in freshly plumaged birds, especially on the innermost pri- 

 maries. The under parts from chin to anus are white ; this color interrupted on 

 flanks by the more or less numerous, large, isolated, dark brown patches, which 

 coalesce just over the flanks. The under surfaces of the wings are white, except 

 just along their edges where they are mottled with brown ; and the apices of the 

 long axillary feathers are brownish. The under tail coverts are deep grayish 



1864.] 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



brown, more or less conspicuously tipped with whitish. The tail feathers are 

 like the outer primaries. The bill is deep blackish horn. The outside of the 

 tibia? and the exterior toe are brownish ; the rest of the feet including the 

 webs yellowish flesh color. 



Dimensions. Total length 18.00 to 20.00 inches and hundredths; expanse 

 of wings 43.00 to 45.00. Bill along culmen 2.00 ; from feathers on side of 

 lower mandible to tip 1.75; depth at base .65, width . GO ; wing from the 

 carpus 13. U0; tail : central feathers 5.75; exterior do. 4.75 ; difference 1.00 ; 

 tarsus 2.40 ; middle toe and claw 2.90 ; outer do. 2.75 ; inner do. 2.30. 



Variations. The differences in dimensions which this large species presents 

 are so great that the above measurements can only be considered as an aver- 

 age ; and individuals will be found considerably above and below the standard. 

 The bills of various specimens, as well as the tarsus and toes, differ to the 

 amount of two or even three tenths of an inch ; the wings from the carpus 

 three-fourths of an inch, or more, and the tail proportionally. The relative pro- 

 portions, however, and the shape of these several parts appear to be pretty 

 constant. 



There also exist greater variations in color than are found in most of the 

 species. The difference appears to depend chiefly upon age, or rather upon the 

 age of the feathers themselves. Just after the moult, when the feathers are 

 fresh and new, they are of a clear deep brown with a considerable of a plum- 

 beous tinge, and their margins are exceedingly light colored, in fact almost 

 white on the tertiaries, etc. With advancing age the feathers become more 

 and more of a duller brown, much like that given by Audubon in his plate ; 

 the margins are broader, less deeply defined, and simply of a dull grayish 

 brown. Constant characters, however, seem to be the uniformity in color of 

 the feathers of the head, there being no light margins to them ; the peculiar 

 line of demarcation on the sides of the head and neck, and the partially white 

 upper, and almost wholly dark under tail coverts. Audubon's plate of this 

 species, otherwise excellent, is very wrongly colored as regards the bill and 

 feet. The bright tints he gives them rather appertain to another species. 



Notwithstanding these variations, the present species is so marked a one 

 that it is not readily to be confounded with any other. Some small and light 

 colored specimens look something like examples of P. Kuhlii ; the exact dif- 

 ferences between the two will be given under the head of the latter. From 

 P. angiorum, its size and the color of the upper parts at once distinguish it. 

 P. obscurus and its allies are too different to require comparison. P. major 

 may always be recognized by the peculiar size and shape of the bill (care- 

 fully examine preceding description) ; by the lighter margins of the feathers 

 of the upper parts ; by the line of demarcation of the white and brown on 

 the sides of the head, as above given ; and by the colors of the under tail 

 coverts and flanks, which are the reverse of those of Kuhlii, its nearest ally. 

 However light the color of the upper parts may be, they never acquire the 

 real ashy tint which is a distinguishing characteristic of the latter species ; 

 and the colors of the bill and feet are always conspicuously different. 



This species has an exceedingly extensive range. It apparently inhabits 

 the entire Atlantic Ocean, up to exceedingly high latitudes. Dr. Schlegel 

 has specimens from points on the west coast of Africa and from the Cape of 

 of Good Hope. A specimen before me from Terra del Fuego, collected by Mr. 

 T. R. Peale, Naturalist of the U. S. Exploring Expedition, is identical with 

 the common north Atlantic biid.

This species, though so long known and so common, yet requires very 

 careful investigation ; both because its bibliography is somewhat exten- 

 sive, and on account of its variations in size and color, which are so consider- 

 able that there has been much confusion concerning it. I will first examine 

 into its synonymy, and then proceed to characterize the species beyond the 

 probability of any further difficulty with its specific characters. 



The Procellaria puffinus of Linnaeus, Gmelin, and Latham, has been various- 

 ly interpreted by modern authors. Most writers, including Kuhl and others, 

 consider it as the bird which was afterwards named P. major by Faber. 

 Temminck makes it equal to the cinervus of Gmelin. Bonaparte and Schlegel 

 regard it as undoubtedly referring to the present species. An examination ot 

 the diagnoses of Linnaeus, or Gmelin, or Latham, particularly the latter, 

 will, I think, make it quite patent that the last is the only tenable view to 

 take of the name. Such expressions as are found in e. g. Latham's notice, 

 as " Pr. corpore supra nigra, subtus albo" * * * "15 pollices longa," 

 etc., can only be considered as referring to the anglorum ; for they are totally 

 at variance with the essential characters of the P. major. Moreover, Latham " 

 cites "P. anglorum, Raii, Syn."as a synonym of the species. Such being the 

 case, I unhesitatingly accord with Bonaparte and Schlegel in their identifica- 

 tion of the Linusean P. puffinus. I am quite at a loss to understand upon 

 what grounds M. Temminck makes the remark that " ni Linne ni Latham 

 n'out connu cet oisean." 



The first recognized classical notice of this species is that given in 1713 by 

 Mr. Ray, under the name of Proc. anglorum. Brisson calls it Puffinus anglo- 

 rum; it is indicated by Linnaeus, Gmelin, and Latham as Proc. puffinus, with 

 "anglorum, Ray," as a synonym. Temminck was, I believe, the first binom- 

 alist who adopted Ray's designation ; he calling it in 1820 Procellaria anglo- 

 rum ; inlS40 Puffinus anglorum. 



This species is also the Proffinus arcticus, Faber (1. c), as is evident from 

 his diagnosis. The reference of Faber's name arcticus to the P. major, as has 

 been occasionally done, is quite erroneous. I have an indistinct recollection 

 of having seen this species cited as Procellaria or Puffinus " manksii," but I 

 cannot at present call to mind the reference. 



A certain "Puffinus Baroli, Bonelli," is admitted as distinct by Bonaparte 

 in his Conspectus, p. 204, and also in his Tab. Longip. in the Comptes Ren- 

 dus. It is said to be somewhat smaller, lighter colored, and with a slenderer 

 bill. Well acquainted as I am, however, with the variations in just these 

 features which the anglorum frequently presents, I cannot discover sufficient 

 grounds upon which to separate P. Baroli even as a distinct variety ; but 

 rather entirely agree with Dr. Schlegel in considering it as an undoubted 

 synonym of anglorum, or at least of P. gelcuanus, which is the representative 

 species in the Mediterranean Sea. 



Bonaparte (Consp. ii. p. 203) inquires "quid Proc. puffinus, Kuhl, Mon.

 unhesitatingly that it is the Puffinus major, Faber. The description is entirely 

 pertinent, and the figure much more readily recognizable as representing the 

 head and bill of this species, than are many of the delineations of the work.

Description. Form: The bill, measured from the frontal feathers, is about 

 three- fourths as long as the skull, rather more than two-thirds the tarsus. Its 

 height at the base is just about equal to the width. Its height at the point of 

 greatest convexity of the unguis hardly exceeds that at the middle of the culmen. 

 The unguis is not very strong, its convexity only moderate. The commissure 

 at first curves gently upwards, then still more gradually downwards for the 

 whole length of the bill, and then is pretty strongly deflected along the edge 

 of the unguis. The outline of the lower mandible is about straight to the 

 unguis, a little concave thence to the tip. The length of the nasal tubes is 

 a little less than a fourth that of the culmen. The outline of the feathers on 

 the upper mandible is the segment of a perfect circle. The folded wings just 

 about reach to the end of the tail. The second primary is nearly as long as 

 the first, the rest successively more and more rapidly graduated. The tail is 

 contained about two and a third times in the wing from the carpal joint. It is 

 much rounded, the lateral rectrices all regularly graduated; the exterior just 

 three-fourths of an inch shorter than the central pair. The tarsus is just as 

 long as the middle toe without its claw. The external toe and claw is a little 

 longer than the middle toe and claw. The tip of the inner claw falls short of 

 the base of the middle one. The claws are all nearly or quite as broad as 

 high, being much dilated on their inner edges. 



Color : The entire upper parts are of a deep lustrous black, with a soup- 

 con of brownish, especially when the feathers are old and worn. On the 

 front and sides of the head and neck the black has a grayish or plumbeous 

 cast. This color extends on the sides of the head much below the eyes, in 

 fact quite to the throat, but it is more or less marbled with white. The 

 under eyelid is pure white, in marked contrast with the surrounding black. 

 On the sides of the neck the white extends further round towards the nape ; 

 on the sides of the breast, on the contrary, the color of the back extends a 

 considerable distance, it being of a decided greyish plumbeous hue, and gra- 

 dually becoming more and more marbled with white till it entirely disappears. 

 The primary quills are black, as are their shafts, their inner webs fading 

 into dull grayish brown. The entire under parts, from chin to under tail 

 coverts, are pure white, with the single exception of a few feathers just on the 

 Hanks, and of the outer webs of the exterior row of under tail coverts, which 

 are plumbeous black. The under surfaces of the wings and the axillary 

 feathers are pure white, with a slight marbling of blackish just along the 

 bend of the wing. The caudal rectrices are like the primary quills ; the in- 

 ferior surfaces of their shafts grayish white. Bill deep greenish black, some 

 part of the lower mandible yellowish. Part of outer side of tarsus, whole of 

 outer side of exterior toe and the claws brownish black ; rest of feet light 

 yellowish, including the webs. 



Average dimensions : Bill along culmen 1.40; height at base .45 ; width 

 about the same ; along rictus 2.10 ; from feathers on side of lower mandible 

 to its tip 1.40 ; wing from the carpal joint 9 25 ; tail : exterior feathers 3.25, 

 middle 4.00; amount of graduation .75; tarsus 1.80; middle toe and claw 

 1.90; outer do. 2.00 ; inner do. 1.55. Total length about 14.00; extent of 

 wings about 33.00 



Variations. As to dimensions, these are quite considerable. As usual 

 among Puffini, the bill differs a good deal in absolute size, as well as in 

 robustness, generally preserving its shape, however, quite contantly. The 

 longest bill before me measured 1.50 ; the shortest 1.30, along culmen, with 

 a corresponding difference in other dimensions. The wing from the carpal 

 joint varies nearly half an inch, and the tail to a corresponding degree. The 

 total length of tarsus and toes varies about a third of an inch. In color the 

 species is more constant, the chief variation being in the greater intensity or 

 more decided brownish tint of the black of the upper parts. Younger speci- 

 mens have more marbling of the plumbeous black and white on the sides of 

 the breast, the color sometimes reaching nearly or quite across the breast, or 



[April,

even invading the throat. In immature individuals, also, the lateral inferior 

 caudal tectrices may be more extensively hued with plumbeous black. They 

 are never, however, so much darkened as is usual in obscurus or opisthomelas. 



This species may be always recognized among its congeners by the follow- 

 ing combination of characters: its peculiar dimensions (see above), joiued 

 to the very dark upper parts, this color descending far on the sides of the 

 head and breast, leaving a conspicuously white under eyelid ; the almost en- 

 tirely white under tail coverts and the comparative shortness and character- 

 istic degree of roundness of the tail. 



This is so very distinct, and at the same time so well known a species, that 

 it hardly requires comparison with any other. The features in which the P. 

 yelcuanus differs from it will be pointed out under the head of the latter.

Habitat. More eastern portions of the Mediterranean Sea ; especially in the 

 Black Sea, and in the vicinity of the Bosphorus. 



With this species, admitted by the majority of modern authors, I am ac- 

 quainted only through descriptions. This is specially to be regretted, since 

 authors are at variance regarding its characters and affinities, and are not even 

 entirely agreed upon its specific validity. Bonaparte considers it to be the 

 representative of obscurus in the Black Sea and vicinity, and says that it is 

 smaller than that species (being only 10 inches in length) and has a slenderer 

 bill. Dr. Schlegel, on the contrary, considers it as most intimately allied to 

 anglorum, which it replaces in that locality. As far as I can jud<2e from a 

 careful study of published descriptions, I entirely agree with Dr. Schlegel in 

 opinion. On comparing it with anglorum, Dr. Schlegel has found it to differ 

 as follows : In the greater elongation of the point of the wing ; in the color of 

 the upper parts being lighter and rather tending to grey than black, as is 

 also the color of the dark feathers of the crissum ; and in the uniform deep 

 gray of the lateral under tail coverts, these latter being, in anglorum, blaek 

 on their outer, and white on their inner webs. 



The following detailed measurements are given by the same author, taken 

 from, individuals coming from the Bosphorus, near Constantinople. They are 

 to be compared with those of anglorum, already given on a previous page. 

 Wing (from the carpus), 8-33 to 8-66 inches and hundredths. Tail, 2-40 to 

 2-60. Bill along culmen, 1-20 to 1-50 ; height, -28 to -33 ; width, -40. Nasal 

 tubes, 16 to -20. Tarsus, 1 66 to 1-80 ; middle toe, 1-58.

 ally found in Europe. Apparently replaced in the corresponding latitudes of 

 the Pacific Ocean by my Puffinus opisthomelas.

and its bibliography is as explicit as that of almost any of the eighteenth cen- 

 tury species of the family. First indicated with tolerable accuracy in Linnsean 

 times, the species has almost invariably been presented under its original and 

 proper specific title, though referred successively to the genera Puffin us, Nec- 

 tris, and Ct/motomus. The names "Vherminieri" of Lesson, and "floridanus" 

 of the Berlin Museum, which I quote upon the authority of Bonaparte, are the 

 only specific synonyms which I have met with. 



There is an unusual and remarkable discrepancy in the statements of vari- 

 ous authors concerning the length of the species, diiferent writers giving the 

 dimension from as little as 93 inches to over 13. It is impossible that it 

 should vary to this extent. I believe the average length is a little over eleven 

 inches. 



Audubon's description of this species is sufficiently pertinent, but the plate 

 he gives is unusually poor, and by no means true to nature. The outline of 

 the bill is exceedingly faulty ; the line of demarcation of the dark and light 

 colors along the side of the head and neck is by no means accurate, and the 

 lower tail coverts are represented as entirely white. The exact insertion of 

 the right tibia of the individual figured has always been to me, anatomically 

 speaking, a puzzle. 



Dr. Kuhl informs us, in the text, that figure 11 of plate ix- of his Mono- 

 graphie der Procellarien was intended as a representation of the bill of this 

 species ; which is fortunate, as otherwise it would be quite impossible so to 

 identify it. 



I am much surprised at the statement by Dr. Degland, (Ornitholo?ie Euro- 

 peene, ii. page 366, published in 1849 !) that " cette espece est peu connue, et 

 il n'est pas certain qu'elle est distincte de la prccedente " P. anglorum ! 

 This author's indication of the habitat of this species is vague, and leaves 

 much to be desired. 



M. Temmiuck (Man. Ornith., ii. p. S08"> gives, under head of P. obscurus, 

 an excellent description of this species, except that the dimensions are inaccu- 

 rate, being far too small.* The exact measurements of both of Temminck's 

 typical examples are given by Dr. Schlegel in his recent monograph of the 

 Procellaridse, (Mus. Pays-Bas, p. 30.) This author finds that one of the types 

 is an example of anglorum, from the Mediterranean Sea, afterwards labelled by 

 Temmiuck himself a P. Baroli, Bonelli ; and that the other is a small, weak- 

 billed specimen of the true obscurus, from the Atlantic Ocean. These facts, 

 supported by the authority of one so well known for diagnostic acumen as 

 Dr. Schlegel, ara indicative of an imperfect acquaintance on the part of Tem- 

 miuck with the species he treats of under the name obscurus. 



The species of Puffinus spoken of in a paper published by Dr. D. W . Pren- 

 tiss and myself in the Annual Smithsonian Report for 1861, (p. 418), as hav- 

 ing occurred at Washington, D. C, and doubtfully referred to as the obscurus, 

 has since been definitely ascertained to be this species. 



Description. Form : The bill is rather small and weak, and considerably 

 compressed, except just at the base. In length along the culmen it measures 

 just about two-thirds the skull, and about three-fourths the tarsus. It is 

 quite stout at the base, where the height very decidedly surpasses the width. 

 The unguis rises rapidly and a little suddenly above the rest of the culmen, 

 and is strongly convex in outline. The commissure, from the insertion of the 

 feathers to the unguis, as well as the outline of the lower mandible as far a3 

 the unguis, is almost perfectly straight. The nasal tubes are short, being 

 much less than a fourth the length of the culmen, but they are elevated and 

 quite conspicuous, much more so than in anglorum. The wings barely reach, 

 when folded, to the end of the long tail. The proportionate lengths of the 

 primaries are the same as in most other species. The tarsus is just as long as 

 the middle toe without its claw. The outer toe with its claw is just as long 

 as the middle one with its claw. The top of the inner claw about reaches the

[April,

base of the middle. The tail is very long, exceeding that of anglorum, which 

 is a much larger species. It is also so very much graduated as to be almost 

 cuueate, the lateral feathers being relatively shorter than in any other spe- 

 cies. The under tail coverts are very long, fully equalling the central rec- 

 trices. 



Color. The upper parts are of a hue quite different from that of anglorum, 

 the black having every where a quite appreciable grayish or plumbeous tinge, 

 and the borders of the feathers being still notably lighter, especially on the 

 scapulars and tertials. The color is deepest on the rump and upper tail cov- 

 erts ; it is much restricted on the sides of the head and neck, not extending 

 below the level of the eyes, and even there its borders are marbled with 

 white. On the sides of the breast the dark color extends considerably more 

 towards the median line, but it is of a very light plumbeous tint, and much 

 variegated with white. Both eyelids are more or less white, and there is, 

 moreover, an indication of a white superciliary streak. The remiges and rec- 

 trices are colored, as in anglorum. The under parts, from the chin to the un- 

 der tail coverts, are white, as are the axillary feathers and inferior alar 

 tectrice.-, the white only interfered with over the flanks by leaden black. The 

 longest posterior under tail coverts are brownish black, as are also one or two 

 rows of the exterior ones, the rest being white, with or without a plumbeous 

 tint. Notice that in amount of white on the under tail coverts, obscurus is 

 just intermediate between anglorum and my new opisthomelas. The bill is 

 deep leaden blue, darker at the apex ; the legs and feet colored, as in anglo- 

 rum. 



Dimensions. Length of bill along culmen, l - 25 ; along rictus, 1-70; from 

 end of nostrils to tip, *90 ; from feathers on side of lower mandible to its apex, 

 1-20; its depth at base, -40 ; width, -35 ; depth at convexity of unguis, -25. 

 Wing, from the carpal joint, 8*00. Tarsus, 1-60 ; middle toe" and claw, 1-80 ; 

 outer do., 1*85. Central tail feathers, 4-25 ; exterior feathers nearly an inch 

 shorter. Total length from tip of bill to end of tail about 11*00 ; expanse of 

 wings about 25-50. 



Variations. I find the differences in size to be about the same, relatively to 

 its dimensions, as in the other smaller Paffini, while, as usual, the general 

 form and the proportion of parts are pretty constantly preserved. The char- 

 acteristic hue of the upper parts is always recognizable, but the precise tint 

 varies with the age of the feathers. The margins of the dorsal tVathers are 

 frequently very conspicuously lighter. The limit of the extent of the dark 

 color on the sides of the head, neck, and breast, hardly differs notably, even 

 with age, and is a strong specific character. The relative amount of the black 

 and white on the under tail coverts is also pretty constant, being intermediate 

 between anglorum and opisthomelas, as before stated. The unusual graduation 

 of the tail is. I believe, always preserved in mature birds. 



The combination in this species of its small size, the tint of the upper parts, 

 and its characteristic line of demarcation with the white on the sides of the 

 head, neck, and breast, together with the color of the under tail coverts, and 

 the length and shape of the tail, renders it readily diagnosticable. As with 

 anglorum, I have taken it as the standard in treating of the other closely 

 allied ; and the peculiar points wherein each differs from it will be found de- 

 tailed under their respective headings.

Description. Form: The bill is rather long, about four-fifths the tarsus, 

 stout, moderately compressed, a wry little higher than broad at the base, the 

 unguis large and strong, its convexity great, and rising much above the level 

 of the rest of the culmen, the depth of the bill at the point of the greatest

140 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



convexity of the unguis being much more than in its middle. The outline of 

 the inferior mandibular rami is about straight as far as the unguis ; the line 

 of the commissure is considerably curved. The nasal tubes are large and 

 prominent, and rather long for this group, being more than a fourth of the 

 culmen ; and the nasal apertures are much elongated, being very elliptical 

 rather than circular. The frontal featheis extend forwards to a point on the 

 median line instead of being the segment of a perfect circle, as in anglorum 

 and obscurus. The folded wings reach beyond the tail. The tail is compara- 

 tively and absolutely much shorter than in obscurus and very decidedly less 

 rounded, the difference between the middle and exterior rectrices being only 

 about half an inch. The feet are as much longer than those of obscurus as 

 is proportional to the greater size of the bird ; the tarsus is as long as the 

 middle toe and half its claw. The outer toe and claw equals the middle ; 

 the tip of the inner claw falls short of the base of the middle one. 



Color. The nasal tubes and culmen are blackish, the sides of the bill yel- 

 lowish or reddish brown, the unguis mostly light bluish white. " The iris is 

 dark brown," (collector's label.) The internal aspect, and part of the outer 

 side of the tarsus, the middle and inner toes and the webs are light yellowish 

 flesh color. The rest of the tarsus, the outer toe and the very margins of the 

 webs are brownish black. The claws are brown. The enfire upper parts, the 

 wings and tail are of exactly the same shade of sooty black as obtains in ob- 

 scurus, but with the following notable difference in the line of demarcation of 

 the white on the sides of the head, neck and breast: the dark color is much 

 more extensive, reaching as far below the eyes as it does in anglorum, and 

 there is no definite union of the two colors ; but as the dark takes on more and 

 more of a lighter plumbeous hue, it insensibly becomes more and more nebu- 

 lated with white. There is no white on either eyelid, nor any indication of a 

 white superciliary line. The under wing coverts are white, as in obscurus : the 

 bend of the wing rather more decidedly mottled with the color of the back. The 

 axillary feathers are more or less blackish towards their ends instead of being 

 pure white. The flanks are more extensively and decidedly fuliginous black 

 than in obscurus. It is in the color of the under tail c >verts, however, that the 

 difference from obscurus is most apparent. These feathers are entirely of a 

 deep fuliginous black, except a few of the shortest ones just posterior to the 

 fundament, which are whitish. 



Dimensions. Bill along culmen 1*40, along commissure 2-00, from end of 

 nasal tubes to tip 1 -05, from feathers on side of lower mandible to its tip 1*40 ; 

 height at base "42, width a little less ; height at convexity of unguis 32. 

 Wing from the carpus about 9*00. Tarsus 1*80 ; middle toe and claw 2-10. 

 Tail 3 - 75 ; outer feathers -60 shorter ; (in obscurus tail 4*25; outer feathers 

 nearly 1*00 shorter.) 



Variations. With but two specimens before me, I cannot speak so fully on 

 this point as I could wish ; but the variations are doubtless quite parallel in 

 all respects with those of anglorum or obscurus. The above measurements in- 

 dicate the average of the two specimens. They are precisely similar in 

 colors. 



Comparison with allied species. This new species differs from obscurus as 

 follows, briefly: In its larger size, as will be palpable from the measurements 

 given of the bill, wings and feet.* In its both relatively and absolutely 

 shorter tail, which is also much less rounded. In the different outline of the 

 frontal feathers on the bill In the different coloration, insomuch that there 

 is no white about the eye ; that the dark color extends much further on the 

 sides of the head and neck ; and that the under tail coverts are almost en- 

 tirely fuliginous black, instead of being for the most part white. 



It is distinguishable at a glance from anglorum by its greatly inferior size, 



* The collector's label gives, "Total length 15 inches; expanse of wing 32;" but these cannot 

 be implicitly relied on. 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



vide measurements ; by the very different color of the ripper parts ; and by 

 the fuliginous black instead of white under tail coverts. 



The Puffinus yelcudnus is lighter colored above than is dnglorum, and there- 

 fore this species approaches it in this respect. But yelcuanus is much larger 

 than the present species, and has white under tail coverts like anglorum ; so 

 that it is impossible to confound it with opisthomelas. 



Still more different is this species from the P. nugax, Solander, from the 

 Australian seas. This latter is a very diminutive species, much smaller even 

 than obscurus, the wing being only about 61 inches from the carpus. It also 

 has the white of the throat extending far up on the sides of the head and 

 neck, and white under tail coverts ; characters diametrically opposed to those 

 which obtain in the present species. 



I am acquainted with no other species to which the present bears any sort 

 of resemblance. I trust that I have so fully and correctly indicated its cha- 

 racters and relationships, that its introduction, even into this peculiarly in- 

 tricate .group, will be the cause of no confusion or uncertainty regarding it. 



Two fine examples are contained in the Smithsonian Museum, both col- 

 lected by Mr. John Xantus at Cape St. Lucas, Lower California. (Smiths. 

 Catalogue, Nos. 16,990, 16,991.)

A fine suite of this well marked species is in the collection of the Philadel- 

 phia Academy. Its relationships are closest with P. obscurus, but the dif- 

 ferences are sufficiently obvious on comparison. It is the very smallest 

 known species of Puffinus, being appreciably less than the obscurus. It is 

 hardly 10-50 inches in length ; the wings from the carpus only about 6 ; th 

 tail averages 2-75 ; the bill about one inch ; the tarsus 1 ; the middle toe 

 about the same. The color of the upper parts is about the same as in P. ob- 

 scurus, or a very little lighter ; the feathers generally with appreciably darker 

 tips. A striking diagnostic feature is found in the extent to which the white 

 of the under parts mounts up on the sides of the head and neck, which is 

 greater than in any other species. The inferior caudal tectrices are usually 

 entirely pure white. The under surfaces of the wings are pure white, and 

 the inferior aspect of the inner webs of the primaries are dull whitish, being 

 much lighter than are these parts in obscurus. The bill is dusky horn color. 

 The tarsi are greeenish yellow ; the webs bright chrome yellow. 



The preceding paragraph shows the points in which the species differs 

 from obscurus. It is too distinct from anglorum or ijelcuanus to require com- 

 parison. It cannot be confounded with my P. opisthomelas, since the latter 

 is nearly as much larger than obscurus as nugax is smaller ; has the colora- 

 tion of the sides of the head and neck very different, (compare descriptions ;) 

 has black instead of white under tail coverts, etc. 



I have not an opportunity of examining the original description of nugax 

 by Solander, but all authors agree that it is the species subsequently named 

 assimilis by Gould. I do not know where the species is called auslralis by 

 Eyton, but quote the name on the authority of Bonaparte.

Critical Remarks on the Genera SEBASTES and SEBASTODES of Ayres. 



BY THEODORE GILL. 



In the Proceedings of the California Academy of Natural Sciences, "Re- 

 marks in relation to the Fishes of California, which are included in Cuvier's 

 genus Sebastes," and subsequently, in the Proceedings of the Zoological So- 

 ciety of London, "Notes on the Sebastoid Fishes occurring on the coast of 

 California, TJ. S. A.,"* have been published by Wm. 0. Ayres, M. D., C. M. Z. S. 



* I have been favored by Prof. Baird with the advance sheets of these Proceedings.

146 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



The object of these memoirs is to show that there are eleven species of Se- 

 bastoid fishes in the Californian waters, distributable among two genera, dis- 

 tinguished only by the prominence or little development of spinous ridges on 

 " the top of the head." For those with ridges he reserves the name Sebas- 

 tes; for those with "little developed " ones, he accepts the name Sebastodes, pro- 

 posed for a natural genus of which S. paucispinis is the only known species. 



Rehearsing the history of Sebastodes, Dr. Ayres admits that the "grouping 

 of characters" assigned to it "belongs onj^y to the single species S. paucispinis;''' 

 and also in his final paper, that "the ' minute scales' belong only to S. pauci- 

 spmis,"* and then proceeds to show that species of other genera have some 

 of the characters attributed to it ! He finally dismisses Sebastodes immedi- 

 ately after the remark that "the 'minute scales' belong only to S. paucispinis" 

 with the conclusion that " it does not seem possible, therefore, (!!) that Sebas- 

 todes can be retained with such limits as were assigned to it by Mr. Gill" ! The 

 logical character of the inference is rather dubious, after the admission of 

 the truth of a principal proposition. But for the benefit of Dr. Ayres, who 

 may doubt the value of the character, the opinion of Dr. Giinther, whose 

 authority he will scarcely gainsay, is adduced. That gentleman attributes to 

 Sebastes " scales of moderate or small size," and not minute ones like those 

 of S. paucispinis, which, although admitted in the genus by him, he had never 

 seen. Giinther has, however, shown his appreciation of the value of the 

 size of the scales in all his diagnoses of the Scorpaenoidae, and has sepa- 

 rated the Triglas of Europe into two genera solely on account of the size of 

 the scales. Therefore the single character admitted by Ayres as peculiar to Se- 

 bastodes paucispinis would alone, in the opinion of some, entirely separate it from 

 his other species, but when it is stated that it also differs remarkably in 

 the form of the head, the skull, the preoperculum, the connection of the 

 vomer and palatine bones, the direction of the anterior teeth of the jaws, 

 the palatine rows, &c, the unnatural character of the association in one 

 genus of it and species of the ordinary Sebastoid form will be obvious. 

 Sebastodes paucispinis is decidedly the only known species of the genus. 



Dr. Ayres " refers without hesitation to the genus of which thg common 

 species of Massachusetts Bay, S. viviparus,f is a member," the species of Sebas- 

 toids with the frontal and coronal spines moderately or extremely devel- 

 oped, stating that the difference in the number of dorsal spines, when " un- 

 supported, does not appear sufficient." In this respect also he differs widely 

 from Giinther: that author distinguishes Sebastes by the number of spines, J 

 assigning to it twelve or thirteen, and emphatically insists upon its value 

 in his remarks on the Centropogon australis, a species with fifteen spines, 

 remarking, that "this species approaches in general habit the genera 

 Sebastes and Scorpzena, from which it must be separated on account of the 

 number of the dorsal spines, a much more certain generic character than 

 the presence or absence of a preorbital spine, which is found in fishes that 

 cannot be separated from Sebastes (S. nematophtkalmus.y '$ Dr. Ayres will doubt- 

 less admit the justness of the denial of the pertinence of any Californian 

 species to the same genus as Sebastes with fifteen dorsal spines, when ac- 

 quainted with this emphatic endorsement of the value of the number of dorsal 

 opines and the depreciation of the importance of the cephalic spines. It is 

 true that Dr. Giinther admits, as the first two species of Sebastes, S. norvegicus 



* Dr. Ayres has in his first article insisted that " the little ' accessory scales' mentioned by 

 Girard are not confined to the three species stated by him, hut are common to all;" but in hie 

 final paper, he has admitted the truth of Girard's and my own descriptions 



f Dr. Ayres has omitted to state that I was responsible for the identification of the Massachu- 

 setts Sebastes with & viviparity and that his knowledge of that identity was solely derived from 



016.

and S. viviparus, which have " fifteen" dorsal spines, and which are indeed the 

 types of the genus, but that gentleman has shown his appreciation of the 

 value of the character, and has only been unhappy in its application : he 

 should have given a new name to the genus defined by him. Dr. Ayres has 

 omitted to inform his readers that the difference in the number of dorsal spines 

 is also supported by a corresponding difference in the number of vertebrae, 

 the species of " Sebastkhthys having, as far as known, only ten abdominal and 

 fourteen caudal vertebrae,"* while Sebastes has about twelve abdominal and 

 nineteen caudal vertebrae.f 



The value of the characters used to distinguish the genera Sebastes, Sebas- 

 tichthys and Sebastodes is now indeed so generally conceded by scientific men, 

 that it is unnecessary to further argue in their favor. I shall only remark 

 that the combinations and distinctions of forms by Dr. Ayres are alike un- 

 natural and violate all natural affinities, and that the distinctions used by 

 him to separate his genera Sebastes and Sebastodes are only of secondary value. 

 More acquaintance with the species of the family would undoubtedly con- 

 vince him of the justness of this assertion. 



Dr. Ayres has been unfortunate in at least one of his identifications, connect- 

 ing Girard's name Sebastes rosaceus with a species of " Sebastodes," with the 

 remark that " this is the species originally described by Girard under the 

 name rosaceus; and again, quite correctly, in the tenth volume of the 'Pacific 

 Railroad Reports.'" Yet S. rosaceus is said to have "the upper surface of 

 the head with horizontal and acute ridges," and is figured with such arma- 

 ture as well as with the second, instead of the third, anal spine longest, 

 the pectoral and ventrals ceasing before the vent, &c. ! Girard's Sebastes rosaceus 

 is indeed a typical Sebastes of Ayres, and entirely identical with the . helvo- 

 maculatus of the latter, as the examination of the two specimens known to 

 Girard has convinced me. The specimens are in poor condition, but the 

 spots are still visible. The Sebastodes rosaceus of Ayres is therefore deprived 

 of a name, and may receive that of Sebastosomus% pinniger. 



It is also proper to here remark that two species are apparently confound- 

 ed by Girard under the name Sebastes melanops, one with, "a small spine upon 

 the suprascapular bone, two others upon the edge of the opercle," and another 

 from Cape Flattery with the lower opercular spine as well as the supraorbital 

 ridges obsolete, and the forehead between the eyes perfectly arched. The 

 latter may be named Sebastosomus simulans. 



In conclusion, the genus Sebastkhthys includes at least three genera. The Se- 

 bastkhthys nigrocinctus is somewhat related to Scorpiena, and distinguished by 

 elevated, serrated coronal crests. Other Californian species represented by the 

 Sebastes melanops, seen by me, differ so much that they may be separated and 

 combined for the present under a genus Sebastosomus, of which the Sebastes 

 melanops of Girard may be taken as the type. Still others, distinguished by 

 the texture of the bones of the skull, armed orbital ridges, prefrontals, &c, 

 and represented by Sebastes rosaceus, Grd., may be named Sebastomus. In a 

 contemplated Monograph of the Scorpaenoids of California, the relations of 

 the species will be more fully discussed.

given in the "Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology," hy Mr. P. 

 W. Putnam, in a "List of Specimens sent by the Museum to different Insti- 

 tutions," and in the Proceedings of the California Academy of Natural Sci- 

 ences by Dr. W. 0. Ayres.* The former enumerates the Triads semifasdata, 

 Girard, Triads Henlei, Putnam (= Rkinotriacis Henlei, Gill) and Acanthias 

 Suckleyi, Girard (= Sgualus Suckleyi, Gill.) Dr. Ayres has in one 

 article announced, very modestly and with scarcely a due appreciation of its 

 bearings, a startling discovery regarding the range of variation of dentition 

 in the Notidanoids, and in a subsequent communication, has informed us of 

 the discovery of a representative of the genus Alopias in the Bay of San 

 Francisco. 



Family ALOPECOID^E. 



Genus ALOPIAS, Raf. 



We are indebted to Dr. Ayres for tbe " Notice of the acquisition of a speci- 

 men of Thrasher," taken in the Bay of San Francisco. The species is a 

 very close representative of the Atlantic form Alopias vulpes, differing, how- 

 ever, in the proportions of the dorsal and anal fins, and in the position of 

 the branchial apertures ; the tail constitutes decidedly more than half of the 

 entire length. The specimen is about five feet in length." (Ayres, op. cit., 

 vol. iii. p. 66.) 



Dr. Ayres has abstained from naming this species, and it may be hoped 

 that the true differences between it and the Atlantic species will be exhibited 

 by the future nomenclator. The announcement of any difference in the posi- 

 tion of the branchial apertures from one not acquainted with the type, will 

 be viewed with much skepticism by selachologists. 



Family GALEORHINOIDsE, Gill. 



Subfamily MUSTELINE, Gill. 



Genus MUSTELUS, Cuv. 



This name may be reserved for the species distinguished by the anterior 

 position of the first dorsal fin and the unicuspid teeth of the jaws. The 

 Mustelus lavis of Miiller and Henle is consequently excluded, the first dorsal 

 fin being nearly midways between the pectoral and ventral fins, and the teeth 

 provided with a lateral cusp in addition to the usual median one ; the foetus is 

 also intimately connected with the uterus by means of a vitelline placenta, 

 according to Miiller and Henle, and is thus essentially distinguished from the 

 typical Musteli which resemble the other Galeorhinoids. That species is 

 therefore a peculiar generic type, and may hereafter be called Plewacromylon 

 lavis. 



If the rule now adopted by many of invariably retaining a generic name 

 for the first species mentioned is adopted, Galeorhinus will supplant Mustelus. 

 I am not yet, however, prepared to adopt that rule, and shall for the present 

 retain the name Mustelus. Galeus cannot be used for the genus typified by 

 the Squalus galeus of Linnseus, and if Galeorhinus, which has been retained 

 for it, should be shifted to Mustelus, a new name will be demanded for the 

 former ; as it is desirable that the change should be as slight as possible, that 

 of Eugaleus may be accepted. 



Mustelus californicus, Gill. 



The first dorsal fin commences over the terminal third of the inner free 

 margin of the pectoral fin, and its posterior point, though acutely prolonged, 

 ceases considerably in advance of the ventral fins. The anterior angle is 

 blunt, but not rounded. The second dorsal is similar in form to the first, 



* Proc. Cal. Acad. Nat. Sciences, vol. iii. pp. 15, 66. 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 149 



but smaller, and its hinder half is over the anterior two-thirds of the anal, 

 with the posterior angle of which its own is co-terminal. (The caudal fin, 

 from the front of the lower lobe to its point, equals the distance between the 

 snout and the interval between the third and fourth branchial apertures ; its 

 terminal lobe little exceeds a fourth of its length, and is squarely truncated 

 behind ?) The ventral fin has its outer margin, from the base to the angle, 

 about as wide as the width from that angle to the posterior point. The 

 length of the rostral plateau in front of the jaw equals the width between 

 the outer margins of the nostrils and the interval between the corner folds of 

 the upper jaw. 



D. 18 | 17. A. 18. P. 22. 



This species is distinguished by the proportions of the snout, the more 

 acutely prolonged posterior angles of the dorsal and anal fins, and perhaps 

 the form of the terminal lobe of the caudal ; but it is probable that the latter 

 is worn, and consequently the statement of the length of the fin and the form 

 of the posterior lobe must be accepted with reserve. The number of cartila- 

 ginous rays found after dissection of the skin is less than in the European 

 species. 



A single adult specimen was obtained by Dr. Stimpson at San Francisco, 

 during his visit to that city as a member of the Scientific Corps of the North 

 Pacific Exploring Expedition. 



From Panama, the Institution has received several specimens of a closely- 

 related species, distinguished by the projection of the posterior angle of the 

 first dorsal fin to the vertical of the origin of the ventrals, although the an- 

 terior fourth of the base of the fin is above the pectoral. The caudal fin 

 equals the distance between the snout and third branchial aperture, and its 

 terminal lobe nearly equals a third of the length, and is obliquely truncated 

 behind. The species may be named Mustelus dorsalis. 



These species are interesting as being the first species of the genus found 

 in the Pacific waters of America. The Mustelus felis of Ayres is a species of 

 Triads ! 



Family NOTIDANOID^E, Owen. 



Genus NOTORHYNCHUS, Gill (ex Ayres). 



In the year 1855, and in the first volume of the Proceedings of the " Cali- 

 fornia Academy of Natural Sciences" (p. 73), "Dr. Win. 0. Ayres exhibited 

 a specimen of a shark of a new generic type, with the following description" 

 of the genus 



"NOTORHYNCHUS, Ayres. 



"Dorsal fin single. Branchial apertures seven on each side. Spiracles 

 two. Nostrils double, subterminal. Snout broad, depressed. Tail much 

 elongated, with the fin beneath. Teeth in several rows, those of the lower 

 jaw flattened, arched, serrated ; those of the upper jaw of diverse forms, the 

 middle ones slender, the outer ones approximating those of the lower jaw in 

 form." 



He remarked, that "the shark here described presents, certainly, a very 

 singular grouping of characters. The only genus with which it can be com- 

 pared is Cuvier's Notidanus, previously separated by Rafinesque under the 

 name of Heptranchias, both founded on Lacepede's Squalus cinereus. With this 

 our type agrees in the remarkable feature of a single dorsal Jin and seven 

 branchial apertures. But in Notidanus the teeth of both jaws are represented 

 as similar inform, and the muzzle pointed, the existence of spiracles being as- 

 serted by the one author and denied by the other. We have also in our fish 

 the tail almost as much elongated as in Alopia*." 



The characters attributed to the genus Notorhynchus are common to all the 

 1864.] 




150 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



representatives of the family, except the number of branchial apertures ; in 

 which respect the genus resembles Notida?ius or Heptranchias. That genus 

 has also the " teeth in several rows ; those of the lower jaw flattened, arched, 

 serrated ; those of the upper jaw of diverse forms, the middle ones slender, 

 the outer ones approximating those of the lower jaw in fcrm;" the "snout 

 broad, depressed ;" "spiracles two," the invariable number when developed 

 in all fishes! and " the tail much elongated, with the fin beneath." Noto- 

 rhynchus is therefore not distinguished by any character whatever from Hep- 

 tranchias, either in the generic or specific descriptions of Ayres. 



Such being the case, Girard and myself referred the species to the genus 

 Heptanchus or Heptranchius, Raf., and the justness of that reference, under 

 the circumstances, will be unhesitatingly admitted by every logical mind. 



The causes of Dr. Ayres' manifold errors in the case are unknown ; the 

 peculiarity of the dentition of the Notidanoids is described in every text-book 

 of ichthyology, and if Dr. Ayres had even consulted the Animal Kingdom, 

 of Cuvier, accessible to English students through a number of translations, 

 his error would not have been committed. 



Subsequently, I discovered the jaws of a Notidauoid taken at Nisqually, 

 Oregon, by one of the gentlemen attached to Wilke's Exploring Expedition. 

 Finding that the teeth were generically similar to those of Heptanchus indicus 

 of Mailer and Henle, and resembled them rather than those of the typical 

 Heptanchi or Hexanchi, and, further, that the teeth of both more nearly re- 

 sembled those of Hexanchus than Heptanchus, I felt compelled to combine the 

 two species in a peculiar genus. I thus connected the views of Muller and 

 Henle and others regarding the generic value of the number of branchial 

 apertures with those of Bonaparte as to the generic value of the dentition. 

 As the Heptanchus indicus was known to be "dark bluish grey above, with 

 numerous small, irregular, black blotches, lighter beneath," the coloration 

 attributed by Ayres to his Notorhynchus maculatus, I ventured to refer the 

 jaws of the Nisqually shark to that species, since color is generally coinci- 

 dent with structure ; the limited number of species of Notidanoids, the absence, 

 so far as known, of two closely-related representatives in a single Fauna, and 

 the occurrence of Ayres' species in the same faunal region as the Nisqually 

 shark, appeared to warrant this identification, the necessity of confirmation 

 of which, however, I did then, as I now do, emphatically insist upon. I 

 therefore perfectly agree with Dr. Ayres as to the impossibility of certainty 

 " when [his] description is so extremely indefinite," and, in order that 

 further cavil at the identification of the Nisqually shark with Notorhynchus 

 maculatus may be avoided, suggest that the former may be named Notorhynchus 

 borealis. 



Having previously identified the Nisqually shark with the Californian 

 Notidanoid erroneously it may be I felt compelled to retain Ayres' name, 

 and did not detail the history of the genus, as such would have involved the ne- 

 cessity of criticism, but simply remarked that the name "was proposed by Dr. 

 Ayres under a misapprehension." 



Immediately after the publication of my article, Dr. Ayres* insinuated 

 that his name was not given under a misapprehension, and asserted that 

 his "' misapprehension' was, that (he) regarded the species as the type of 

 anew genus. ' ' Such misapprehension is of course evident, but I cannot perceive 

 why the name should be considered apart from the idea of the genus. I in- 

 deed think that the name itself, considered in the abstract, is objectionable 

 and rather unmeaning if not, indeed, more censurable. The etymology of 

 the name is not obvious; its formation would indicate that it meant " back 

 snout, or beak," but it is possible that it is composed of vsflo? and pvyxS, in 

 allusion to the protuberant snout.

Dr. Ayres then implies that it is only after several changes that I have ar- 

 rived at the conclusion regarding the generic distinction of Notanhynehus. I 

 have had two opinions, one, before seeing the species, that it was a Heptran- 

 chias of Rafinesque or Baptanchus of Miiller, accepting the views of Miiller 

 and Henle, Gray, Girard, &c., and the final one, after study of the Nisqually 

 jaw, that it was the representative of a distinct genus. For that genus I 

 have adopted Ayres' name, but by no means the ideas connected with it by 

 him. 



One statement of Dr. Ayres is especially entitled to attention, as, if cor- 

 roborated, it must effect an entire revolution in our views respecting the value 

 of dentition, and is entirely opposed to the experience of Miiller and Henle, 

 Bonaparte, Agassiz, and all others. He remarks that my description of the 

 dentition " represents the individual specimen on which it was founded ; but 

 the species is quite common here, and I find that the number and the forms 

 of the teeth vary so much that my original description, which Mr. Gill says 

 is ' equally applicable to any species of the family,' is fully as close as nature 

 will allow us to draw." It is certainly rather unfortunate for science, as well 

 as himself, that Dr. Ayres has omitted to produce proof of so remarkable a 

 discovery, as, on account of the respectability and number of the gentlemen 

 alluded to who have adopted other views, and in deference to whom reasons 

 might be assigned, it will be regarded with at least some doubt and skepti- 

 cism, notwithstanding even Dr. Ayres' assertion. It is scarcely necessary to 

 remark, that if this discovery is confirmed, Notorhynchus must be suppressed 

 and its species referred to Heptranchias ; but until such is done, it may, with- 

 out any imputation on the perfect reliability of Dr. Ayres, be retained, since 

 that learned gentleman has himself done so, notwithstanding his discovery 

 and the admission of a misapprehension in regarding its representative as 

 the type of a new genus. 



June 1th. 

 Mr. Jeanes in the Chair. 

 Seven members present. 



Mr. Gill called the attention of the members to several points in Ichthy- 

 ology and Couchology. He exhibited from the collection of the Academy a 

 specimen of a species of Percopsis obtained by Surgeon General Hammond in 

 Kansas. The differences between it and the Percopsis guttatus, Ag., of Lake 

 Superior, also exhibited, were strong ; the head is larger, (contained 3 \ times 

 in the length, exclusive of caudal ,) the dorsal is higher, (the longest ray equal 

 to 4| of length ;) the anal is also higher, (the longest ray contained six times 

 in length ;) the pectoral equals the height of the dorsal (=4| ;) the ventral 

 especially is longest, contained 5| times in the length, and its extremity covers 

 the anus, which is nearer the snout than the margin of the caudal fin. The 

 species may be named, in honor of its distinguished discoverer, Percopsis , 

 Hammondii. 



Mr. Gill remarked that, after an examination of the species of Sodis, Raf., 

 and Paralepis, Cuv., in the collection of the Academy, he was convinced that 

 the families of Paralepidoids and Alepidosauroids were most closely allied. 



Mr. Gill next referred to the history of the name Gymnotus, showing that it 

 had been originally founded solely on the Gymnotus carapus, and that even 

 after the introduction of the Gymnotus electricus into the system, the G. carapus 

 was retained as the first of the genus. The retention of the name Gymnotus 

 for the G. electricus and the bestowal of a new one on G. carapus are therefore 

 obvious infractions of the laws of nomenclature. The name Gymnotus must 

 be retained for G. carapus, and a new one given tothe Gymnotus electricus, Linn. 



1864.] 




152 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



That of Electrophorus will be appropriate. This change is the less to be re- 

 gretted, as the nomenclature of carapus is in a confused state, that name having 

 been previously applied by Rafinesque to a species of the genus Fierasfer. Mr. 

 Gill gave an enumeration of the genera of Gymnotoids, admitting the genera 

 Electrophorus, Gymnotes, GUI, (Gymnotus sequilabiatus. Humb.,) Gymnotus, Art., 

 (=Carapus,) Sternopygus, M.T., Hypopomus, Gill, {Rhamphichthys Mullcri, Kaup,) 

 Rhamphichthys, M. T., Sternarchus, Schneid., and Sternarchorhynchus, Cast. Mr. 

 Gill concluded by suggesting that the Gymnotoids were perhaps related to 

 the Nematognathi, and remarked that he knew several undescribed species. 



Mr. Gill next called attention to the fact that the genus for which the name 

 Melantho had been recently accepted from Bowdich, had long before been 

 characterized under the name Campeloma by Rafinesque. In June, 1819, in 

 the 88th volume of the Journal de Pbysique, (p. 423,) that type is introduced 

 in the following terms : 



(26) Campeloma. Test ovale. Ouverture ovale, base tronquee, lievres r6- 

 flechies, flexeuses, unies en pointe poste'rieurement. Point d'ombilic. Ani- 

 mal inconnu. J'en ai une seule espece trouv^e dans l'Ohio. C. crassula. 4 

 tours de spires contraires, sommet aigu, test epais, ouverture plus de la moitie 

 de la longueur totale. 



This diagnosis is evidently only applicable to a Viviparoid, and was doubt- 

 less founded on a reversed specimen of the Paludina ponderosa of Say, or a 

 closely related species. The name has indeed been referred, by the erudite 

 Hermannsen, to the synonymy of Melanopsis, and in this he has been followed 

 by the brothers Adams, but the diagnosis, as well as the habitat, cannot sup- 

 port such a reference. 



In advance of the publication of the generic name Campeloma, Rafinesque 

 had proposed a new genus Ambloxis in the third volume of the "American 

 Monthly Magazine and Critical Review," (p. 355, Sept., 1818,) which was also 

 doubtless intended for the Paludina ponderosa and its congeners,* but the in- 

 sufficiency of his generic diagnosis, as well as the want of connection with 

 any described species, will prevent its adoption. 



The speaker remarked that he would not attempt to enumerate the species 

 of Campeloma, as he could not agree with previous authors regarding their 

 limits, and had not the material to arrive at a satisfactory opinion himself ; 

 he could therefore only refer to the genus an assemblage of forms represented 

 by the same specific names as were formerly placed under Melantho, after the 

 exclusion of Paludina Elliottii of Lea, which probably belongs to the genus 

 Lioplax. The names referred to the synonymy of the other species mentioned 

 under that genus appear to represent forms of the genus, with the exceptions 

 of Paludina cornea, Val., and Lymnula ventricosa, Raf. The former name was 

 doubtless proposed for the Lioplax subcarinata, having the " sutures deeply im- 

 pressed," and the " rampe " around the spire being especially characteristic 

 of that shell. The Lymnula ventricosa was probably founded on Anculosa prae- 

 rosa, or an allied species.

BY DR. WM. STIMPSON. 



The following descriptions are extracted, by permission, from the Zoological Report of tho Boun- 

 dary Commission. They were written in the year 1860, and accompanied by illustrative drawings 

 of all the species, which, It may be hoped, will suon be published. 



CRUSTACEA. 



ECPAGURUS KeNNKRLYI. 



Carapax smooth, except where the seta? are attached. Median tooth of the 

 front nearly obsolete ; lateral teeth small but sharp and well-marked. Eyes 

 moderately long and slender, but not longer than the peduncle of the outer 

 antennae ; cornea little dilated, with a tuft of hair at the apex. Acicles small, 

 pilose, not reaching the tips of the eyes. Feet all very hairy. Chelipeds 

 short and stout, both falling considerably short of the extremities of the am- 

 bulatory feet, and strongly but not very thickly armed with short spines. 

 In the greater cheliped the carpus is about as long as the palm of the hand ; 

 fingers shorter than the palm ; two distinct rows of sharp tubercles on the 

 dactylus. Smaller cheliped hardly reaching to the middle of the dactylus of 

 the greater one, convex, or with an obtuse median carina armed with strong 

 spines. There are no prominent spines or tubercles on the inferior surface 

 of the merus and carpus in either cheliped. Color of hands in alcoholic spe- 

 cimens light red. 



Length 2 inches ; length of carapax, 0*4; of right carpus and hand together 

 0-51 inch. 



An orthodactyle species, near E. pubescentulus, but with shorter and strongly 

 spinous chelipeds. We have named it after the late lamented naturalist who 

 discovered it. 



HlPPOLYTE PRIONOTA. 



A short, plump species. Carapax with a high, compressed back, crested 

 nearly the whole length, somewhat channelled longitudinally on each side 

 near the crest, and armed with three spines in a longitudinal row above 

 and behind the eyes ; also with a strong antennal and a pterygostomian spine. 

 Dorsal crest not sharp and lamelliform, but armed with four strong teeth, the 

 front edges of which are beset with aculei, which, especially in the posterior 

 teeth, form a transverse row when viewed from above. Rostrum more than 

 half as long as the carapax, lamelliform, very broad, though not as broad as 



1864.] 




154 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



long ; its front outline blunt, triangular or rounded ; whole upper front and 

 end margin minutely serrated with hispidiform teeth ; lower margin with 

 four small simple ones near the end. Eye with a spine at the inner apex ; 

 squamiform appendix to the antennae elongate-triangular in shape, with 

 pointed end, not reaching beyond the rostrum. External maxillipeds reach- 

 ing nearly to extremity of rostrum, and provided with both exognath and 

 epignath ; antepenult joint broad, with a strong spine at the external apex. 

 Feet of the first, second and third pairs provided with an epipod. Abdomen 

 with the dorsum rounded ; third joint a little prominent, with an obtusely 

 triangular, not conspicuous tooth at the posterior margin ; lower margins 

 of the segments smooth and obtuse, except the fourth and fifth, which form 

 teeth. Four pairs of dorsal aculei on the terminal joint. Length about one 

 inch. 



Easily distinguished from the other North Pacific lamelli-rostral species by 

 the serrated margins of the dorsal teeth and rostrum. It approaches nearest 

 to H. spina (Soioerbei), but has three supra-orbital spines instead of two. From 

 H. pectenifera it differs in the non-pectinated margins of the abdomen. 



Seven specimens of this fine species were dredged in February and March, 

 by Lieut. White, in different parts of the Sound, viz., in Hale's Passage, 10 

 fathoms, soft bottom ; off Lummi I ., in 8 12 fathoms, shelly; near San Juan 

 I., in 2 4 fathoms, mud. 



HlPPOLYTE SUCKLEYI. 



Carapax with the anterior half of the dorsum crested and sloping forward ; 

 no supra-orbital spines ; a strong antennal and pterygostomian spine present. 

 Fourth joint of abdomen acute below. Rostrum large, but scarcely as long 

 as the carapax, curved, rather broad and lamelliform, with a slender acute 

 tip ; lower margin four-toothed ; upper margin including crest of carapax six- 

 toothed, beginning at the anterior third of the length of the rostrum. External 

 maxillipeds of moderate size, reaching nearly to extremity of antennary ap- 

 pendix, and provided with both exognath and epignath. Feet long, the last 

 pair reaching nearly to the tip of the rostrum ; first pair only provided with an 

 epipod ; dactyli of the last three pairs elongated, with only one terminal un- 

 guiculus. Abdominal segments with smooth edges ; superior margin of third 

 segment obtuse. Length \\ inches. 



In the characters of the dorsal crest and rostrum it is much like H. Gai- 

 mardi, but it has no spine over the eye. From H. Fabricii it differs in having 

 more numerous teeth on the superior margin of the rostrum, some of which 

 are placed nearer to its extremity. It has less numerous superior teeth than 

 occur in H. Layi. 



Dredged in the circumlittoral zone. We have conferred upon this species 

 the name of our friend Dr. Suckley, one of the earliest and most successful 

 investigators of Pugettian Zoology. 



HlPPOLYTE STYLUS. 



Body slender ; abdomen strongly genticulated. Carapax smooth ; back not 

 crested except for a short distance anteriorly. There is an antennal spine, 

 but neither supra-orbital nor pterygostomian. Rostrum slender, somewhat 

 styliform, perfectly straight, and equal to the carapax in length ; it is armed 

 above with four or five teeth near the base, while the anterior two-thirds is 

 edentulous ; below there are five or six teeth. Antennary appendix oblong, 

 scarcely shorter than the rostrum, and obliquely truncate at the end. Exter- 

 nal maxillipeds very small, reaching only to the extremity of the peduncle of 

 the antennae, or to the basal third of the rostrum ; they are provided with an 

 epignath, but no exognath. None of the feet have an epipod. Terminal joint 

 of the abdomen with four pairs of dorsal aculei. Length 1 inches. 



Taken in the Straits of De Fuca by the U. S. Exploring Expedition.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 155 



HlPPOLYTE GRACILIS. 



This is the most slender species which has come under our notice. The cara- 

 pax is crested at the anterior third ; there are no supra-orbital spines, but the 

 antennal and pterygostomian spines are present, the latter spine being high 

 in position from the narrowness or little height of the carapax. Rostrum 

 exceedingly slender, scarce higher than wide, curved, a little longer than the 

 carapax, and armed with four teeth over the eye ; elsewhere smooth to the 

 tip ; below there are four minute distant teeth. The antennulae are rather 

 long, the thick flagellum reaching to the extremity of the rostrum. Anten- 

 nary appendage a little longer than the rostrum. The external maxillipeds 

 reach to the middle of the rostrum and have no exognath ; the epignath per- 

 haps exists, but we have been unable to discover it in our specimens. The 

 feet are very slender, and none of them have an epipod. The abdomen is 

 very long and strongly geniculated. Third segment compressed and promi- 

 nent, as in Pandalus; penult joint much elongated. Length \\ inches. 



Found in deep water. 



Idothka Whitei. 



Body slender ; sides slightly convex ; head large. Outer antennae nearly 

 two-thirds as long as the body ; the flagellum equalling the peduncle in 

 length and composed of from sixteen to eighteen joints. First thoracic seg- 

 ment short, less than two-thirds as long as the second. Abdomen segmented 

 as in /. Wosnessenskii and the others of this group ; it is one-half longer than 

 broad, slightly narrowing posteriorly, with the extremity rounded, truncate, 

 and bluntly acuminated at the middle. Feet moderately stout. Color yel- 

 lowish, minutely punctate with dark gray. Length of body 0-81 ; length of 

 abdomen 0-27 inches. 



It is allied to /. Wosnessenskii, but is very much more elongated. It differs 

 from 1. media, following Dana's description, in its much longer antenna?. 



We have dedicated this species to Lieut. J. W. White, who commanded the 

 Revenue Cutter in the Sound while the Boundary Survey was in progress, 

 and who rendered essential aid to the Naturalists of the Survey, by dredging 

 many of the most interesting novelties which were obtained. 



Idothea urotoma. 



Body nearly linear, nearly five times as long as broad, broadest at the sixth 

 thoracic segment. External antennae a little more than one-half as long as 

 the body ; last two joints of the peduncle subequal ; flagellum a little shorter 

 than the peduncle and ten-jointed. Abdomen consisting, as in the others of 

 the group, of three joints, with the partial separation of a fourth ; subrectan- 

 gular with convex extremities, and scarcely less broad at its truncate poste- 

 rior extremity than at the anterior. The posterior extremity is peculiar in 

 shape, the angle on either side projecting strongly, and separated by a notch 

 from the convex or subtriangular middle portion, which bears a small tooth 

 at the middle. The opercular abdominal feet which cover the branchial or 

 swimming feet are large, nearly covering the entire under side of the abdo- 

 men. Thoracic feet slender. Length of the body 0-75 ; greatest breadth 0-17 ; 

 length of the abdomen 0-20 inch. 



We find no note of the depth of water in which this species was dredged. 



Aega belliceps. 



Smooth, subelliptical, and pointed anteriorly. Head with a small, short, 

 blunt, rostriform process over the base of the superior antenna?. Eyes ovate, 

 very large, but distant, and beautifully granulated (facetted). Thorax rather 

 broad ; segments each marked with scattered impressed puncta?, mostly in a 

 transverse row. Abdominal segments five in number, the terminal one scuti-

x orm, with its margin entire ; apex obtuse. In the alcoholic specimens the 

 color of the body is yellowish-gray, clouded; lateral margins with a series of 

 black spots or blotches ; base of abdomen black; caudal segments edged with 

 blackish ; eyes blue. Length of the body 0-T6 ; greatest breadth 0-37 ; length 

 of caudal segments 0-20 inch. 



Two specimens are in the collection. It is perhaps an Acherusia, but we 

 have access to no figure or description of that genus of Lucas. 



Bopyroides acutimarginatcs, nov. gen. et sp. 



We propose this name for a new parasitic anisopod which we are unable 

 to refer to any genus hitherto established, though it approaches very closely 

 to Bopyrus in form, and indeed in all its characters, except that the abdomi- 

 nal branchiae of the female are rudimentary, being merely transverse fleshy 

 ridges, instead of laminae. The upper surface, except the somewhat convex 

 head, is flat and smooth, with the segments sharply defined. The margins of 

 the body are very acute and somewhat recurved, especially at the head. The 

 abdomen is distinctly six-articulated, the joints being indicated by deep in- 

 cisions around the entire margin, dividing it into eleven subequal parts, so 

 that the terminal joint is very small, no larger than a lateral extremity of one 

 of the preceding ones. It is 0-29 inch in length, and 0-21 in greatest breadth. 



It is found in the branchial cavity of Hippolyte brevirostris. 



Bopyrus hippolytes Kroyer, belongs properly to the same genus. From this 

 species ours differs in the acuteness of the margins and in the sharply square- 

 cut lateral extremities of the abdominal segments. 



Capeella Kennerlyi. 



A large, pellucid species. Head armed with two small slender spines 

 above, in a transverse line over the eyes. No spines on the first thoracic 

 segment, and scarcely any on the second. The remaining segments, how- 

 ever, are armed with strong sharp tubercles on the sides, and a few smaller 

 ones above. These tubercles become progressively sharper posteriorly. Su- 

 perior antennae about one-half as long as the body ; peduncle very thick 

 and strong, with the first joint shorter than the second, and the last joint 

 two-thirds as long as the second ; flagellum very thin, filiform, equalling in 

 length the last joint of the peduncle, and consisting of twenty joints. Inferior 

 antennae small, reaching the middle of the second joint of the superior anten- 

 aae, subpediform, and setose below. Branchial vesicles subovate, one-half 

 longer than broad. Hand of the second pair of feet elongated, nearly three 

 times as long as broad, thick and armed with two or three small slender teeth 

 on the concave palm. Feet of the three posterior pairs short. 



Length of the body 1-1 ; of the superior antennae 0-52 ; of the first and 

 second thoracic segments taken together 0*44 inch. The description is that 

 of a male. 



Found on the bottom of the Revenue Cutter at Port Townsend. 



Amphithoe humerams. 



Body robust, entire ; dorsum rounded, smooth and unarmed. Eye of mode- 

 rate size, rounded, situated on a short projection of the head between the 

 bases of the superior and inferior antenna?. Superior antenna nearly as long 

 as the body, the peduncle constituting less than one-third of its length ; fla- 

 gellum tapering to an exceedingly fine extremity. Inferior antenna half as 

 long as the body, with its flagellum no longer than the antepenult joint of 

 the peduncle. Epimera of the fifth pair large. Gnathopoda, or feet of the first 

 two pair, with rather small, weak, subpediform hands in both sexes ; those of 

 the third and fourth pairs with the basal joint very large and much expanded, 

 nearly as broad as their epimera ; meros-joint in the same pairs small, com- 

 mune,

pressed, with a sharp arcuated anterior margin. Caudal stylets all with 

 equal rami ; last pair with the rami very short and flattened, the outer one 

 armed with small hooks at its extremity. Telson small, obtuse-triangular. 



Length of the body in a female, 1-2 ; height at the fifth thoracic segment, 

 epimera included, 0-25 inch. 



Found about low-water mark. 



Anonyx filigkb. 



Head with a strong triangular process on each side beneath the base of the 

 superior antennae ; extremity of this process not acute. Superior antenna? 

 very short, about as long as the head, with a long, thick pencil of hair on the 

 inner side of each ; basal joint large, with a strong protuberance above, 

 forming a prominent angle at its anterior extremity ; flagellum seven-jointed, 

 the first joint constituting one-third of its length ; accessary flagellum tri- 

 articulate. Inferior antenna? longer than the body; the peduncle, however, 

 constitutes but a small part of their length, being but little larger than the 

 superior antenna? ; the very slender filiform flagellum appears as if serrated 

 above, but is not provided with calceolae. The first pair of feet in our sin- 

 gle specimen appear to be pointed and simple, the dactylus not being re- 

 tracted against the manus, which has no palm ; second pair with a minute 

 truncate hand, supporting a small tuft of hair at the base of the dactylus. 



The dorsum in this species is sharp, or carinated, but not dentated, being 

 entire and smooth in outline for the greater part of its length, and similar in 

 the thoracic and first three abdominal segments. There is, however, a deep, 

 triangular sinus between the third and fourth abdominal segments, the latter 

 being strongly protuberant, projecting over the very small fifth segment. The 

 second abdominal segment is subtruncate below, and has a deep semicircular 

 sinus on the anterior lateral margin, near its lower extremity. Rami of the 

 last pair of caudal stylets shorter than those of the second pair, and telson 

 rather elongated and slit in two down the middle. 



Length about one-third of an inch. 



It resembles an English species of which a figure has been privately circu- 

 lated by C. Spence Bate, Esq., under the name of " Lysianassa chausica M. 

 Edw." 



Dredged in deep water, by Lieut. White. 



Gammarus scbtener. 



A small, compressed species of rather soft and delicate structure. Dorsum 

 rounded. Epimera moderately large. Eye broad-oval, nearly round. An- 

 tennae of both pairs very slender; superior ones as long as the body. Basal 

 joint more than twice as thick as the next, but shorter ; third joint less than 

 half as long as the second ; flagellum with about thirty articulations ; acces- 

 sory flagellum nearly twice as long as the last joint of the peduncle. 



Inferior antennae nearly three-fourths as long as the superior ones ; first 

 joint of the peduncle armed beneath with a sharp process, which nearly 

 reaches the end of the second ; third joint more than twice as long as the 

 first ; fourth shorter than third ; flagellum two-thirds as long as the pe- 

 duncle. 



Second gnathopod with merus and carpus acute below ; hand subovate, 

 twice as long as broad ; palm oblique, with a small, sharp tooth at its pos- 

 terior extremity, reached by the tip of the finger when closed. First, second 

 and third joints of the abdomen armed above with a sharp central spine on 

 the posterior margin, and with four or five minute spines, or sharp comb-like 

 teeth on each side of the middle spine, the margin bearing these latter spines 

 being a little concave. At the corresponding part of the fourth and fifth ab- 

 dominal segments, there are also two or thre spines similar to the central 



1864.] 




158 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



spine of the other segments, though not quite so large. Telson bifid, the 

 forks rather elongated. Color of the alcoholic specimens greenish-grey, 

 mottled with paler and darker patches. Length about two-fifths of an inch. 



Although we have not seen the posterior pair of caudal stylets in this spe- 

 cies, which are lost in both our specimens, we have little doubt that it is 

 closely allied to G. longicauda Brandt, which inhabits the Asiatic coast of 

 the North Pacific, in which these stylets are very long. It differs from the 

 Asiatic species in having a spine at the extremity of the palm in the greater 

 gnathopod, in the shorter terminal joint of the peduncle of the superior an- 

 tennae, in the basal spine of the inferior antennae, and in the arrangement of 

 the dorsal spines of the abdomen. 



This species inhabits the circumlittoral zone. 



AMPHITHONOTUS 8EPTEMDENTATCS. 



Strongly compressed and carinated, like A. carinata ; carina dentated pos- 

 teriorly, the last two thoracic, and first five abdominal segments terminating 

 posteriorly in teeth ; last two teeth very much projecting and sharp. Head 

 with a deep notch or sinus on the front margin, near the inferior angle, at 

 the insertion of the inferior antennae. Rostrum rather slender, sharp, a 

 little curving downward, and reaching to a little beyond the middle of the 

 first joint of the superior antennas. Eye moderately large, oval, and oblique 

 in position. Antennae about one-third as long as the body ; the superior 

 ones with flagellum of eleven joints ; inferior ones about as long as the su- 

 perior, with a forward-pointing spine at the base below, and a seven-jointed 

 flagellum. 



Gnathopoda with small but well-formed subcheliform hands ; remaining 

 feet as usual in A. carinatus and the other species of the group. Length half 

 an inch. 



Found at and below low-water mark. 



Amphithonotus occidentals. 



Closely allied to the arctic A.panopla Kr., and the east-coast species, A. 

 cataphractus Stm., but differing from both in being more elongated, having 

 less height and breadth. It also differs from the latter species in being less 

 strongly carinated and dentated ; but the carinae are sharper than in A. pan- 

 opla and the two teeth on the second abdominal segment are especially 

 prominent. The integuments are rather less indurated than in the allied 

 species. The superior antennae are a little longer than the inferior, but 

 scarcely more than one-fourth as long as the body. 



Length from tip of rostrum to tip of telson, 0-76 ; greatest breadth, 0-21 ; 

 height, 0-24 inch. 



Two specimens were brought home by the Boundary Commission. 



AMPELISCA P0GETICA. 



Head not much produced. Antennae of both pairs very slender ; superior 

 ones less than half as long as the inferior ones, with the basal joint very 

 thick, twice as thick, though only half as long, as the next joint. Superior 

 antennae four-fifths as long as the body ; peduncle long, smooth above. 

 Dorsum of the thorax and abdomen for the most part smooth and rounded, 

 but the last three joints of the abdomen are separated from the preceding 

 ones by a deep notch, and project into two sharp teeth. Terminal joint 

 in the third and fourth pairs of feet, one-half longer than the two preceding 

 joints together. In the seventh pair of feet the meros-joint is expanded pos- 

 teriorly into an ovate lamina, fringed with plumose setas, as in A. laevigata. 

 Posterior margin of the third abdominal segment with a small notch just 

 above the inferior angle. Lasi pair of caudal stylets large, with rami much

longer than those of the two preceding pairs. Telson oblong, narrower and 

 less tapering than in most species of the genus. 



Length 0-45 inch. 



Dredged in ten fathoms, on a muddy bottom, in Hale's Passage, by Lieut. 

 White. 



Ammothea longicaudata. 



Body broad, robust, hispid above. Eye placed on a high papilla, and 

 double, or divided in two longitudinally. Chelate "antennae" much shorter 

 than the proboscis ; their slender lower branch, however, is much longer, 

 nine jointed, not tapering, and with blunt extremity. Proboscis large, very 

 stout, elliptical in outline. Feet rather thick, fourth joint stoutest ; upper 

 surfaces sparsely hispid; basal joints armed with slight dentiform protuber- 

 ances, ovigerous feet of moderate length. Abdomen large, half as long as the 

 body. Diameter nearly three-fourths of an inch. 



We know the genus Ammothea of Leach only by the short diagnosis of 

 Dana, in the U. S. Exploring Expedition, Crust, ii., p. 1390 (" Nympho affinis. 

 Ramus antennae longior, 9-articulatus,") and may be wrong in referring this 

 species to it. One specimen occurs in the collection. 



GEPHYREA. 



Phascolosomum exasperatum. 



Body brownish, curved in the form of an arc, and thickest near the poste- 

 rior extremity. Surface wrinkled transversely and covered with small black- 

 ish grains, about one- sixtieth of an inch in diameter, rather larger and less 

 crowded posteriorly, and smaller and less numerous on the concave than on 

 the convex side. Proboscis bluish-white, with numerous irregular transverse 

 blackish bands, interrupted on the concave side. The proboscis being par- 

 tially retracted in our single specimen, we are unable to see its extremity dis- 

 tinctly, but it seems to have a series of six or eight crowded rings of minute 

 blackish echinulations next the mouth, as in the allied forms. 



Length 2 inches ; thickness of the body, 0-46; thickness of proboscis, 0-2 

 inch. 



Sternaspis affinis. 



Almost identical with S.fossor Stm., from Massachusetts Bay, but with the 

 body smoother about the middle, where there is no trace of the echinated an- 

 nuli, which may be discerned even on the middle segments in S.fossor. 



Found in muddy bottoms in from ten to twenty fathoms. 



Dredged by Lieut. J. W. White. 



TUNICATA. 



Cynthia haustor. 



Body globular, strongly and coarsely corrugated in an irregularly reticu- 

 lating manner, with the interstices deep and the prominent parts covered with 

 coarse sand, strongly agglutinated. Apertures at the extremities of long cy- 

 lindrical tubes, nearly equalling in length the diameter of the body. These 

 rubes are wrinkled transversely, and are from one-third to one-half as thick 

 <is they are long. The branchial tube is considerably longer than the anal. 



Diameter about two inches. 



With the next species, this forms masses which are found somewhat abun- 

 dantly on shelly bottoms in the circumlittoral zone in Puget Sound. 



Cynthia Gibbsii. 



Body elongated, attached at one end, more or less cylindrical, or somewhat 

 appressed and, when contracted, half as thick as long. Surface free from 

 1864.] 




160 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



encrusting matters, corrugated both longitudinally and transversely ; the 

 longitudinal plications are frequently strongest and most regular, but often 

 they are rendered irregular or nearly obliterated by the transverse ones. 

 The apertures are placed near together at the extremity of the body on 

 slight protuberances, which are probably produced in life into short tubes. 

 Branchial sac with ten slight longitudinal folds, not lamelliform ; filaments 

 at its summit numerous, small, slender and simple. 



The largest specimen is 1-4 inch in length, and 0-6 in breadth. 



According to Dr. Kennedy's notes, this species was dredged by Lieut. 

 White at the following places: Port Townsend, in 4 fathoms, shelly bottom, 

 and also on a muddy bottom in 10 fathoms. Off the N. W. end of Lummi 

 Island, in 15 fathoms, shelly bottom. 



The dedication of this fine species to one so well known upon the survey as 

 Mr. George Gibbs, is scarcely necessary to indicate the great interest he has 

 taken in its scientific results. 



Cynthia coriacea. 



A tough, unornamental species, with no very strongly marked characters. 

 It is irregularly egg-shaped, and attached by a broad surface on the right 

 side of the body. The test is free from agglutinated matters, smooth, and 

 scarcely at all wrinkled, except about the apertures, which are on rather large 

 protuberances, probably extensible in life into short tubes. The branchial 

 aperture is largest, and situated at the extremity of the body; the anal a 

 little behind the middle of the upper side. Branchial sac with about the 

 same number of folds as in the preceding species, which are, however, very 

 prominent and lamelliform, being broader than half the width of the inter- 

 spaces. The filaments at the summit of the branchial sac appear to be few, 

 and shaped like the palpi of the bivalve acephala. 



From the slight indications yet observable in the specimen, it would seem 

 to have been of a reddish color when alive. 



It was found upon the "shore of Island No. 2, off Salt Spring Island, March 

 9, 1859," by Lieut. White, of the Revenue Cutter. 



Cynthia villosa. 



Of similar size, and allied to the C. echinata of the North Atlantic, of which 

 this is the analogue or representative species on the west coast. It is, how- 

 ever, easily to be distinguished from that species by the character of the vil- 

 losity or short, hair-like processes with which the test is covered. These are 

 shorter, more numerous than in C. echinata, and not provided with radiating 

 hairs at the summit, being simply tapering to a fine extremity, and sparsely 

 pubescent on their sides. 



The base of attachment in this species i3.very small, and the test at that 

 point is produced into a peduncle, which is sometimes as long as the body is 

 thick. This peduncle is, however, entirely similar to the test in character, 

 and not at all like that of Bollenia. Our largest specimen is about 0-6 inch 

 in diameter. 



Dredged by Lieut. White in "Port Townsend, 10 fathoms, muddy bottom," 

 and "off the N. W. end of Lummi Island, in from 8 to 15 fathoms, on Ihelly 

 bottoms, March 2d and Feb. 22d, 1859." 



Genus CHELYSOMA, Brod. and Sow. 



The "tortoise-shell" Ascidians, which form the curious arctic genus 

 Cheh)soma y have the posterior extremity of the body flattened, forming an 

 oval disk with a raised margin, and the surface divided into polygonal plates. 

 But two species have been hitherto known, the C. 3facleayana, from Green- 

 land, and G. geometrica (Ascidia geometrica Stm. ; Mar. Invert, of Gr. Manan.) 



[June, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 161^ 



from the Bay of Fundy. We have a third species from Behring's Straits, and 

 that described below makes a fourth. 



Chelysoma producta. 



All other known species of this genus are remarkable among Ascidians for 

 their depressed form, the body being very short, sessile, attached by their 

 flattened anterior extremity, to which the broad disk is parallel, and forms 

 nearly the whole of the part of the body which is exposed to view. In f. 

 producta, on the contrary, the anterior part of the body is much produced, 

 laterally compressed, and longer than the disk is broad, while its attachment 

 is inferior and usually very narrow. In well-formed specimens the dorsum 

 is compressed and arched with a well-marked carina, beneath and parallel 

 with which the rectum may be seen through the translucent test. The disk 

 is obliquely placed, and its margin projects strongly beyond the sides of the 

 body. Its surface is divided into 14 polygons, 4 5 sided, beside the two 

 which contain the apertures, each of which latter is again subdivided into six 

 triangular valves. 



In our largest specimens the body is 1-5 inch in length, and 05 broad at 

 the middle; the disk is 1-08 high and 0-81 broad. 



It is usually attached to Sertularians. 



Dredged by Lieut. White in " 8 to 12 fathoms, shelly, off the N. W. point of 

 Lummi Island." 



HOLOTHURIADAE. 



Pentacta piperata. 



Allied to P. frondosa. Body ovate, smooth and glabrous, of a yellowish 

 color, speckled and spotted with black. Sucking feet retracted in our speci- 

 mens, not numerous, and arranged in five irregular rows. Tentacula short 

 and broad, ramose. Length (contracted) \\ inches : breadth, 0-8 inch. 



We find three or four specimens in the collection, none of them with pro- 

 truded tentacles. 



Pentacta populifer. 



Body thick-fusiform in shape. Surface entirely covered with minute, per- 

 forated, polygonal, calcareous plates, each plate having from twenty-five to 

 forty holes, and being armed with a sharp umbo or spine at the centre of its 

 outer surface. Sucking-feet small, of moderate length, very numerous, and 

 arranged in five regular double rows, extending from one extremity of the 

 body to the other. Tentacula ten, eight large and two small ; the large ones 

 of elongated form, and shaped like Lombardy poplar trees, (Populus drtatata), 

 branching nearly from the base ; branches short. The small tentacles are 

 placed together, and are minute, not a tenth part as long as the others. 

 Length of the largest specimen 2 inches ; usual length from 1 to 1 inches. 



From the number of specimens collected we judge this species to be com- 

 mon in the Sound. It is found in the circumlittoral zone. 



The Influence of the Earth's Atmosphere on the Color of the STA3LS. 



BY JACOB ENNIS. 



From the small amount of attention paid to the colors of the stars as a dis- 

 tinct branch of physical research, a vague and indefinite impression has been 

 somewhat prevalent that the atmosphere of our earth has great power in 

 producing the apparent colors and the changes of colors of the fixed stars. 

 The subject is highly important. During the last two or three years it has 

 occupied much of my attention, and I propose in this paper to present my 



1864.] 11 




162 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



method of investigation and the results to which I have been led. To ascertain 

 what the influence of the atmosphere might be, I selected for special obser- 

 vation a few of the larger stars, taking some of the red, some of the blue, 

 some of the green, some of the yellow, and some of the white. So many 

 different classes of stars watched carefully during the various changing cpn- 

 ditions of the atmosphere, seemed most likely to yield valuable conclusions. 



1. The red stars were Aldebaran, Antares, and Betelgeuse. These are all 

 o different shades and intensities of red. In proportion as the atmosphere 

 loses its transparency by the condensation of moisture, these stars lose their 

 distinctive peculiarities. Their redness gradually becomes obscured, and they 

 at last appear of a dull, unsatisfactory white. 



2. The blue stars were Capella, Rigel, Bellatrix, Procyon and Spica. Some 

 of these, as first Procyon, and then Pugel, are far more intensely blue than 

 the others. But as the atmosphere becomes thick and more impervious to 

 distinct vision, their different intensities of blue fade away, and the observer 

 is at length puzzled to decide of what color these stars really are. He feels 

 safest in announcing that they seem white, though not of a clear, decided 

 whiteness. 



3. The green stars were Sirius, Vega, Altair and Deneb, or the largest star 

 in the Swan. These stars were observed to be green by myself, in the fol- 

 lowing order: Sirius in the autumn of 1862, Vega in June, 1863, and Altair 

 and Deneb in August, 1863. It is remarkable that a very slight haziness in 

 the sky completely hides their green color, and causes them to appear un- 

 mistakably blue. A still thicker haziness has the same effect on them as it 

 has on all the blue stars already described, gradually obscuring their blue 

 color, and ranking them among the many hundreds of stars which the naked 

 eye cannot decide to be colored. 



4. The yellow star was Arcturus ; this being the only one which appears 

 decidedly yellow to my vision, unaided by instruments. Several others in- 

 cline the naked eye to regard them as yellow, such as Polaris and the larger 

 stars of Ursa Major and of Cassiopeia, but not sufficiently so to produce a 

 firm belief. Arcturus, in a clear sky, has a fine light orange yellow ; but as 

 the sky becomes less and less clear, the yellow fades away, and ultimately 

 the color of this star turns to a dim white, and becomes undistinguishable 

 from that of the larger stars of Ursa Major, with which, from their position, 

 it may be handily compared. 



5. The white stars were Regulus, Denebola, Fomalhaut, Polaris, the con- 

 stellation of the Wagon, and several others of the second and third magni- 

 tudes. They may be called white stars with reference to their appearance to 

 the naked eye, to mine at least, but we are not bound on that account to 

 believe them to be really white. As they are not first magnitude stars, they 

 probably seem white to the unaided eye only because their light is not suffi- 

 ciently great in amount, or intense in color, to appear colored. There may 

 be persons with unaided vision acute enough to perceive their true colors. 

 But whatever may have been the conditions of the atmosphere, I have never 

 observed them to be other than white. No changes of the air have had the 

 power of presenting them in any shade as colored stars. 



Thus the influence of the atmosphere of our earth upon the stars of all the 

 different colors, according to these observations, is the same. Whether the 

 stars be red, blue, green or yellow, the effect of changes in the atmosphere is 

 to rob them of their peculiar shades and intensities, and to reduce them all 

 to a dull colorless condition, a dim whiteness, in which their indistinctness 

 produces a feeling of uncertainty and doubt in the beholder. Nor in any case 

 have I seen any change in the atmosphere turn a star from one color to 

 another, except from green to blue, and this is simply reducing one shade to 

 another; for green, like purple, is but one of the modifications of blue. I 

 have never seen a red star become blue, nor a blue star become yellow, nor 



[June, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 163 



any other similar change by any change in the atmosphere. If such an occur- 

 rence were possible, I believe I would have observed it during the past two 

 or three years. The effect of moonlight in obscuring the colors of the stars, 

 and giving them a yellowish shade, can hardly be called an atmospheric ac- 

 tion. Neither can the effect of the rays of the sun in the earliest daybreak of 

 the morning or in the latest twilight of the evening, be called an atmospheric 

 operation. Such an effect tends to impart a general whiteness to the stars, 

 obliterating their colors in part or in whole, the same as in the end it oblite- 

 rates all their light. 



The question now arises, How is it that the atmosphere, when hazy and 

 imperfectly transparent, has the power of depriving the stars of their colors, 

 whatever their colors may be, and reducing them all alike to a dull whiteness ? 

 The reason may be seen in the simple fact of the obstruction of their light. 

 Their light becomes diminished in amount to such a degree that it no longer 

 has the power to produce the sensation of color on the retina. Nearly all the 

 stars, when viewed through a telescope, are colored ; they are of some hues 

 other than white. Of this I adduced evidences in my communication for 

 these Proceedings in June, 1863. They appear colored through the telescope 

 because their light is collected by the instrument in a comparatively large 

 mass ; so large that it can make their colors readily perceived. Take away 

 the instrument from all except the larger stars, and the pencil of light becomes 

 so small as to be without the power of imparting the sensation of color. In 

 the same manner the pencil of light from the larger stars may be reduced by 

 haziness in the atmosphere to so small an amount as to be incapable of im- 

 parting the sensation of color, except a dull whiteness, whatever their real 

 colors may be. 



But how does it happen that a green star is changed by haziness to blue ? 

 I once thought that possibly this effect might be due to the same cause which 

 makes the deep ocean, the distant mountainns, and even the atmosphere, ap- 

 pear blue. After further observation and reflection I cannot adopt that ex- 

 planation ; for then all the stars, like the distant mountains, would be colored 

 blue. Then there would be no such contrasts of all colors among the stars 

 as we now behold. The true explanation seems to be that the mists of the 

 atmosphere, in acting on the light of a green star, first obstructs the yellow 

 rays, and after these are all absorbed then the blue rays alone will be visible, 

 and the star must appear blue. Ultimately the mist may become so impervi- 

 ous that the attenuated ray of light can no more excite the sensation of color 

 and the star must appear dimly white. 



Before it can be admitted as a scientific truth that the atmosphere of our 

 earth has the power of changing the color of a fixed star from one hue of the 

 rainbow to another totally different, there must be brought forward a number 

 of well authenticated facts as grounds for such a belief. We must have the 

 specifications of certain stars which have been seen to change, and the dates 

 of such changes, and the conditions of the atmosphere by which such changes 

 have been produced, and also the numbers and the names of the persons by 

 whom such phenomena have been witnessed. Such evidences of the changes 

 of the colors of the fixed stars by our atmosphere have never been seen nor 

 heard, and for my part, judging by my own observations, I never expect to 

 see them, nor to hear of them. An exception to this remark may be the case of 

 a green star turning to blue, as already explained. Perhaps another excep- 

 tion may yet be found, as indicated in the following passage from Humboldt. 

 The italics are not in the original : " We do not here allude to the change 

 of color which accompanies scintillation, even in the whitest stars, and still 

 less to the transient and generally red color exhibited by stellar light near the horizon, 

 a phenomenon owing to the character of the atmospheric medium through 

 which we see it, but to the white or colored stellar light radiated by each 

 cosmical body, in consequence of its peculiar luminous process, and the dif-

Ferent constitution of its surface. The Greek astronomers were acquainted 

 with red stars only, while modern science has discovered, by the aid of the 

 telescope, in the radiant fields of the starry heavens, as in the blossoms of 

 flowering plants and in the metallic colors, almost all the gradations of the 

 prismatic spectrum." The turn of the expression "still less " shows that he 

 regarded the matter as inconspicuous and unimportant, and the remark is 

 made only in a casual manner. Nevertheless, incidental as the remark may 

 seem, it is the most precise and circumstantial I have found in any author on 

 the influence of the atmosphere on the colors of the stars. But is it really 

 true that the atmosphere can impart a transient and generally red color to 

 stellar light when near the horizon ? In the absence of all confirmation to 

 the above remark of the distinguished philosopher, I selected as test stars 

 Vega and Capella, both first magnitude stars, the former green and the latter 

 blue, and the one or the other is grazing the northern horizon nearly all the 

 year. But I have been unable to detect the changes he mentions. May not 

 his remark have arisen from observations on the planetary bodies, and have 

 been inadvertently extended to the fixed stars? The planets, especially Ju- 

 piter, according to my observations, are sometimes, though rarely, sensibly 

 reddened like the sun and moon by the atmosphere. But whether Humboldt's 

 assertion be confirmed or not, it cannot effect our decision about the real 

 changes of the colors of the stars. No one would pretend to announce a 

 change in the color of a star simply because of a " transient " appearance of 

 a change while near the horizon. In the same manner, probably, the idea 

 has got afloat in a vague manner that, because the atmosphere of our earth 

 has the capability of giving occasionally a red color to the sun, moon and the 

 planets, it must therefore have not only the same effect on the fixed stars, but 

 even the power to turn them to all the hues of the spectrum between red and 

 blue. But this rapid generalization is no more warranted by sound reason- 

 ing than by observation. The sun, the moon and the planets have sensible 

 disks, which the fixed stars have not. Hence the optical phenomena of these 

 two classes of bodies differ widely. The fixed stars, under the influence of 

 our atmosphere, are made to scintillate ; they then twinkle with an unsteady 

 light, and to good eyes they flash out rapidly and fitfully all the varieties of 

 colors. This shows the difference, in an optical point of view, between the 

 fixed stars and the other celestial bodies, and the impropriety of a hasty gene- 

 ralization from one class to the other. Because the atmosphere can redden 

 one class it by no means follows that it can redden the other, much less that 

 it can impart to the other all imaginable hues. 



Another cause for the belief that the atmosphere can impart different colors 

 to the stars, may be found in the necessity for some explanation of their 

 changes of color. It is assumed, though without any known reason, that the 

 intrinsic colors of the stars cannot change, at least in the space of two thou- 

 sand years, and hence there is a necessity for an explanation of their appa- 

 rent changes in some other way ; and as the handiest method these changes 

 are attributed to the atmosphere of our earth. That the various colors of the 

 stars are not produced by our atmosphere, nor by optical instruments, nor by 

 personal peculiarities of vision, becomes perfectly evident from the following 

 simple consideration. If their colors were produced by any one of these 

 causes, then there would not be that beautiful contrast of colors which we 

 now behold; then it could never have been said of the cluster Kappa Crucis, 

 that the various bright contrasted colors of its different members give it all 

 "the effect of a superb piece of fancy jewelry." Instead of this there would 

 be in that cluster, and in every other region, a dull monotonous color in all 

 the stars alike. It has happened that travellers, in coming from Europe to 

 America, have expressed their surprise at the beauty of our sky, when notic- 

 ing for the first time in their lives the different colors of the stars. This hag 

 been supposed to be the work of our atmosphere, the natural operation of the 



[June, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 165 



gaseous envelope of our earth. The true explanation is this. The stars ap- 

 pear colored to the naked eye in Europe as well as in America. Astronomical 

 observers see them colored the same in all countries. But in some countries 

 their colors are slightly dimmed by the more habitual haziness of the atmo- 

 sphere, so much dimmed that they are not noticed by unprofessional gazers. 

 When these latter persons arrive in a more cloudless region, they notice the 

 colors of the stars simply because a slight veil is withdrawn, and not because 

 new colors have been added. 



The evidences of changes of color are now most abundant among the 

 double and multiple stars. This is because the colors of these have been 

 more generally recorded. Hence the importance of having records made, ag 

 frequently as possible, of the colors of all the stars, as they appear both to the 

 aided and the unaided vision. Of course no careful observer will decide on the 

 color of a star from its appearance in an unfavorable atmosphere, nor will he 

 neglect the influence of the sun and moon, nor other means for correcting 

 and confirming his observations, as presented in the rules of my last paper.*

This species belongs in the section embracing the South American species, 

 and the C. molossus, from all which it is quickly distinguishable. It has 

 fewer labials and more scales below the eye than molossus, and possesses 

 a different pattern of coloration, though the tints are nearly the same. The 

 affinities with adamanteus and a t r o x are not distant ; the plates of the 

 muzzle and coloration are different. 



Crotalus triseriatus Wagler (Uropsophus Wagl., Crot. lugubris Jan,) is 

 not rare on the Mexican Table land. It is allied to C. lucifer, but espe-

In this genus and Tomodon the hypapophyses of the vertebras are, a? usual 

 among the Asinea, not developed behind the anterior fifth or sixth of the 

 column. A group of genera partly coinciding with that forming Jan's family 

 Potamophilida;, I find to possess these processes even to the vent, offering a 

 new character of definition to the subfamily of the Homalopsinae, as tbey 

 may be called. The genera in which this structure exists are Eurostus D. and 

 B., Gerarda Gr., Hypsirhina Wagl., Cerberus Cuv., Homalopsis Kuhl., Heli- 

 cops Wagl., Atretium Cope,' Tachynectes Fitz., (this genus is coryphodont in 

 dentition ;T. chrysostictus is a Helicops) ; Trop'idonotus Kuhl., Tham-

 Cope, Ninia B. and G., Storeria B. and G., Haldea B. and G., Tropidoclonium

 weak for a short distance posteriorly. In Tretanorhinus, otherwise similar 

 to this group, there are only strong keels, as in a few Colubrine genera. Gla- 

 niolestes and Heterodon do not belong here ; the processes are wanting ; so 

 also with Xenodon and Thamnodynastes. Hydrops and Calopisma belong to 

 another section.

Of the preceding species of Anolis, sixteen have been derived from the Brit- 

 ish Museum collection. My particular acknowledgments are due to Drs. Gray 

 and Giintber, the directors, for the ample facilities afforded me in the exami- 

 nation of these and of other objects of interest under their care.

This species is said to be found in the Orizaba Valley, Mexico. It is figured by 

 Prof. Dume>il in the Archives du Muse6, 1856, pi. xxi. Specimens are also in the 

 Museums of London and Leyden, the latter of which, through the liberality of 

 Prof. Hermann Schlegel, have served as the types of my description. 



The Laemancti fitzingeri, obtusirostris and undulatus of Wieg- 

 mann, belong to the genus Urostrophus, while th*e L. acutirostris is a 

 true Polychrus. The type specimens of Wiegmann are preserved, under the 

 direction of Prof. Peters, in the museum of the Friederich Wilhelm's University 

 in Berlin. My thanks are due to the Professor for the many facilities which he 

 kindly placed at my disposal, during investigations among these and his own 

 numerous types.

A species to be compared with clarkii, zosteromus and s p i n o s u s, 

 and differing from them and all other species in the fewness of the femoral 

 pores, thus approaching the genus Froctotretus. The frontal is not narrow as

 received specimens, 6492, through Cha3. N. Itiotte. 



This animal is the tropical representative of our S. undulatus, though 

 in general appearance not unlike the formosus. The much stronger mucro- 

 nation and eniargination of the scales, especially on the sides, as well as the 

 color, are distinguishing traits.

The genus Lampropholis was first established by Dr. J. E. Gray, and called 

 by him Mocoa. I prefer using the more classic and prior name of Fitzinger, 

 though the genus is not to be attributed to this author. The present species 

 is the first which has been found on the American continent. The American 

 species placed in it by Gray belong to the genus Oligosoma Grd., under which 

 Lygosomella Grd., Leptosoma Fitz., and perhaps Ilombronia Grd., may be placed 

 as synonyms. 



Oligosoma gemmingeri.

 larger. Body stout, cylindrical, limbs short, weak, the anterior reaching the 

 anterior margin of ear anteriorly, posteriorly not touching extremity of ap- 

 pressed hind limb by its length. Seven upper labials ; one frenonasal, frenal, 

 and freno-orbitar each ; parietals short ; interparietal nearly broad as long. 

 End of muzzle to axilla 10 lines ; axilla to vent 1 in. 8 1. ; posterior limb 8% 1. 



Above fulvous or brown ; beneath yellowish white. A dark dorso-lateral 

 Streak extends from the nostril to a distance on the tail, which is light bordered 

 above on the body, and borders above a dark lateral shade. 



Hab. Orizaba, Mexico. From Prof. F. Sumichrast. Mus. Smithsonian, 

 No. 6331. 



This Mexican representative of our O. laterale differs in its stouter body 

 and shorter limbs, its nearly equal dorsal and nuchal scales, its much shorter 

 posterior cephalic and labial plates, and in color. Named in pleasant recollec- 

 tion of Dr. Max. Gemminger, of Munich, author of Fauna Boica and other works. 



Paludicola pustulosa. 



Muzzle compressed, narrow, plane above, produced beyond labial margin ; 

 canthus rostralis rounded. Nares nearly terminal ; eyes rather large, each lid

 latter color predominating anteriorly, but divided by a median yellow line to 

 symphysis mandibuli.

Paludicola is a genus of Wagler's which has been latterly overlooked. It 

 is the only one beside Schismaderma among the Bufonidie which lacks the pa- 

 rotoids ; from this genus it differs in its manubrium sterni. free toes, and tarsal 

 spur, in this last respect resembling Gomphobates biligonigerus. It

agrees with Bufo in the fully developed frontoparietal bones, differing from 

 Epidalea (Bufo c a 1 a m i t a Auct.) and Pseudophryne in this respect. 



Pbyllomedusa dacnicolor. 



Parotoids exceedingly weak, if present. Fingers very slightly, toes one-third 

 webbed. Labial margin projecting, profile sloping. Tympanum one-half 

 orbit. Eyes not very prominent, transparent, inferior palpebra reticulated with 

 white veins. Mandibular outlines straight. Tongue long, pyriform, openly 

 emarginate posteriorly. Skin above smooth ; inferior areolations not extend- 

 ing on pectoral or gular regions. Vomerine teeth in two straight transverse 

 rows between anterior margin of inner nares. A few small pustules on ante- 

 rior part of sides, which are yellow, like the inferior surfaces. Superior sur- 

 faces (narrowly on femur,) violet blue. Upper lip not light bordered ; gular 

 region and posterior faces of femora immaculate. From end of muzzle to 

 posterior border of tympanum 10 lines: from angle to angle of mandible 1 in. 

 1 1. ; end of muzzle to vent 3 in. 6 1. ; anterior extremity 2 in. ; posterior limb 

 3 in. 10 1. 



Hab. Near Colima ; from the large Xantusian Coll. 



This species diverges widely from the type of Phyllomedusa in its webbed 

 toes and almost absent glands, but the glands are only a little stronger in the 

 P. a z urea. It affords an easy passage to the true Hylae, whose family it en- 

 ters, by the genus Agalychnis Cope. The type of the latter is Hyla c a 1 1 i- 

 d r y a s Cope, and H. m o r e 1 e t i i and holochlora are the other species. 

 They have the tongue long and extensively free, sometimes emarginate, and 

 the transparent inferior palpebra reticulated with strong white veins. The 

 inner toes are remarkably lengthened and free of movement. 



On the Limits and Relations of the RANIFORMES. 



BY E. D. COPE. 



Similar relations to those which exist between the mammalia Implacentia- 

 lia and the remainder of the class, and vice-versa, are apparently repeated in 

 other groups of greater or less rank in the animal kingdom. Among the 

 tortoises, the Pleurodera separate themselves most strongly by the union of 

 their ischia with the plastron, the absence of the arch of the o. prefrontale 

 which elsewhere descends to the o. palatinum, or vomer, and their intergular 

 shield ; while they present modifications among themselves characteristic 

 of most of the other families, arranging themselves according to the develop- 

 ment of the parieto-mastoid arch, in an ascending series, which terminates 

 in Bothremys and Podocnemys, where the temporal fossa is entirely roofed 

 in, as in the sea turtles. In the Lacertilia Acrodonta we have a group 

 equally removed from others of the order. The acrodont dentition, the great 

 development of the o. dentale and final extinction of the o. operculare, etc., 

 and the exclusion of the premaxillare from contact with the vomer, are pecu- 

 liarities not found associated in other lizards, while their parallel representa- 

 tion of the groups of the Iguauida? at least, among the Pleurodonta, is well 

 known. In general these also form an ascending series to be measured by 

 the gradual extinction of the o. premaxillare* and o. columellum, which 

 finally occurs in Chamaeleo. 



The Raniformes among Batrachia Salientia are in many respects compara- 

 ble to the Acrodonta. They stand at the head of their order, possessing the 

 most compact, powerful and complete organization, and in spite of the con- 

 stant imitation of the many lower types, their is a certain homogeneity in 

 important points. The structure of the sternum separates them at once, and 



* This bone, said to be single in Lacertilia, is divided iu all the true Scincidae, in Phyllurus 

 among the Geceotidse, and, according to Owen, in Hatteria.

presents less variety than in the other suborders. The o. o. coracoi'dea are 

 distally much dilated horizontally, especially anteriorly, and in close contact 

 on the median line ; their axis is transverse. The o. o. 'epicoracoi'dea are also 

 transverse, and usually in contact medially, always resting against the ante- 

 rior angles of the coracoi'dea. The manubrial and xiphisternal pieces are 

 dilated proximally and become cylindrical or styloid, terminating in a carti- 

 laginous disc. The only other cartilages of the sternum are the intersutural. 

 Frogs with this sternum always have a cylindrical diapaphyses of the sacrum, 

 and never a fronto-parietal fontanelle. In the ordinary type of sternum the 

 coracoi'dea are little or not dilated, and converge posteriorly without meeting, 

 while the epicoracoi'dea converge anteriorly and are connected with the for- 

 mer by longitudinal arched cartilages ; hence I have termed these Arciferi. 

 Among the toothless Batrachia or Bufoniformes (which have dilated sacral 

 diapophyses, except in one genus), some forms show an approach to the Rani- 

 form style, while in the Aglossa we find the most exaggerated Arciferous 

 type. 



The Raniformes embrace but one family, but this imitates well many 

 genera of Arciferi. The metropolis of the former, as of the Acrodonta, is the 

 Regio Palaeotropica, while the latter have but few representatives out of the 

 R. R. Neotropica and Australis, where but one or two species of the former 

 occur. In both we can trace a series in which the outer metatarsal is gradu- 

 ally liberated from the penultimate, to afford greater extension for the web 

 in the most aquatic types, and among those where these bones are bound, 

 from webless to webbed types. In both we have burrowing and arboreal 

 genera.

 be drawn :

It is, however, remarkable that the Raniform tree-frogs nearly always have 

 the external metatarsal bone free, the Arciferous always bound ; the terminal 

 phalanges of the latter are constructed on a ball and claw type, in the former 

 they are T-shaped or bifurcate, except in the single West African genus Lep- 

 topelis, where the South American type is repeated. 



Evidently belonging to former times, as their present weak representation 

 and generalized structure seem to indicate, are two families of Arciferi not

at all imitated among the Raniformia. These are the Discoglossida? and Aste- 

 rophrydidae. In both the vertebrae are opisthocoelian instead of procoelian, 

 and the sacral diapaphyses are dilated. The latter approaches closest to the 

 ordinary type, having a simple coccyx with but one condyle, no ribs or fron- 

 to-parietal fontanelle, and a styloid xiphisternum. The genera are Megalo- 

 phrys, Xenophrys, Asterophrys, Leptobrachium and Cryptotis, one Indian, one 

 Australian, the rest Malaysian. The former family is the most remarkable. 

 It has rudimentary ribs, a xiphisternum divided into two long haemapophyses, 

 a coccyx with diapophyses and two condyles, and, in the recent types, a fronto- 

 parietal fontanelle. The genera are Latonia, Discoglossus, Alytes, and Bom- 

 binator, all European. There are no arboreal types in these two families, 

 and their terminal phalanges are straight, conic. They form the nearest living- 

 approach to the Batrachia Gradientia. 



The Batrachian which have been called Proteroglossa form, I believe, a 

 family Rhinophrynidre among the Bufoniformes. 



Description of a GAR-PIKE, supposed to be new Lepidosteus (Cylindrosteus^ 



oculatus. 



BY PROFESSOR ALEXANDER WINCHELL. 



In the month of February, 1863, the Museum of the University of Michigan 

 received a specimen of an unknown gar-pike, from Duck Lake, Calhoun Co., 

 Michigan. As Prof. Agassiz had made a special study of this genus, and had 

 declared that he was acquainted with twenty-two species, I transmitted to him 

 a brief description of the fish ; but, for some reason, I received no reply. I 

 sent the same to Prof. Baird, but obtained no assistance ; I then wrote Mr. 

 Putnam, at Cambridge, for references to all the published descriptions of 

 Lepidostei, and, a few months ago, received the information sought ; though 

 most of it was already within my reach. On Prof. Agassiz' visit to Ann 

 Arbor, last winter, during my absence this fish was shown to him by Dr. Sa- 

 ger. Prof. Agassiz thought it had been described by Dr. Kirtlaud, but he 

 could not say in what work the description had appeared. The impression 

 given was, that it had been published in some agricultural work, in Ohio, not 

 generally accessible, and not likely to be seen by ichthyologists. I wrote to 

 Dr. Kirtland on this point but received no reply. I am convinced that this 

 species, if ever described, has not been made known through such a medium 

 that the description can be said to be published to the scientific world. I am, 

 therefore, determined to run tbe slight risk of creating another synonym, by 

 offering the following name and detailed desciiption. 



Lepidosteus (Cylindrosteus) oculatus. Winchell. 



General form elongate-spindle-shaped, laterally flattened toward the tail, 

 and vertically flattened from the nape forwards. Greatest he ; ght contained 

 10 times in the whole length ; greatest width the same. Lower outline 

 nearly straight, slightly ascending at the throat, and more so from a point an- 

 terior to the anal to the base of the caudal fin ; upper outline gently curved 

 along the back, anteriorly somewhat more rapidly curved to a point over the 

 angle of the mouth ; lateral outline gently and equally curved from the ex- 

 tremity of the snout to the base of the tail ; greatest vertical diameter through 

 a point about three scales in front of the abdominal fins ; greatest transverse 

 diameter through a point about six scales in front of the abdominals. 



Number of scales in a diagonal series (between the dorsal and ventral rows) 

 18, occasionally increased to 19, by the interpo ation of an additional scale 

 near the ventral row ; number of scales in the dorsal row, between the head 

 and the dorsal fin, 48 ; behind the dorsal fin, 8 or 9. The first diagonal series 

 of scales do not meet on the nape of the neck, being separated by the pair of 

 mutually equivalent scales of the dorsal row, which belong in the second di- 

 1864.] 




184 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



agonal series ; these two scales are pentangular. The scales of the dorsal row 

 increase in width from the third to the sixth ; the third is small, triangular ; 

 the fourth, rounded posteriorly and slightly curved on the four other sides ; 

 the fifth becomes emarginate posteriorly, convex on the two contiguous sides, 

 and overlapped antero-laterally by the adjoining scales of the next anterior 

 diagonal series ; the sixth exhibits the same form with a greater transverse 

 diameter ; the seventh is small again, and the width gradually increases to 

 the tenth ; the eleventh in turn is small, and the size increases to the six- 

 teenth, beyond which the size is rather variable. From the sixth to the 

 twenty-second, the general form of the sixth is preserved, with a tendency to 

 become less and less emarginate, and more elongate longitudinally. The lat- 

 eral scales are rhomboidal, those which lie along the lateral line having the 

 dimension which coincides with the direction of the diagonal series one and 

 one-third times the other dimension. The longer sides are nearly straight ; 

 the shorter, sigmoidally curved by lines which first bend downwards and 

 then upwards. This form of the scales is shown to some extent by nine or 

 more lateral rows on each side. Generally, the scales nearer the head are less 

 angulated behind ; while those toward the other extremity are more drawn 

 out. The surfaces of the scales, where not worn, are rough to the touch ; 

 and under a magnifier, and even to the naked eye, are seen to be covered 

 with fine granules. The first diagonal series is sculptured by vermicular, in- 

 tersecting furrows, which show a tendency to radiate from the central area. 

 Similar sculpturing can be traced on the sides, as far back as the sixth series. 



Head one fourth the total length of the fish, lanceolate in outline, laterally 

 tapering, with slight curvature from the hinder border of the openula to the 

 extremity of the trumately rounded snout. Eyes large, situated less than 

 the diameter of the orbit behind the extremity of the lower jaw. Projection 

 of the upper jaw beyond the lower, equal to the distance between the nos- 

 trils, which, opening upwards, in oval apertures, are situated half the same 

 distance behind the tip of the snout. Lower jaw a little more than half the 

 whole length of the head. Angle of the mouth midway between the tip of 

 the snout and the hinder margin of the operculum. Each ramus of the jaw 

 presenting below a flat surface, with parallel borders extending directly back 

 for a short distance, and then slightly arching outwards ; on its lateral surface 

 regularly increasing in vertical width to the small "angular piece ;" through 

 half its whole length projecting laterally beyond the maxillary ; furnished 

 with a principal row of strong conical teeth slightly bent backwards and in- 

 wards ; the lips furnished with a smaller Sf-t, aud the internal surface clothed 

 with a multitude of dentelets. The principal and labial teeth of the maxil- 

 lary and intermaxillary are similar to those of the lower jaw; the palatines 

 are set with numerous fine teeth. The top of the head is somewhat flattened, 

 becoming decidedly so on the snout. The suture bounding externally the 

 frontal and parietal bones is a distinct, deep furrow, gently deflected outward 

 at the base of the maxillary, behind which is a deep supra-orbital emargina- 

 tion of the frontal, which thence continues to widen regularly to its junction 

 with the parietal. Opercular semicircular behind, nearly straight in front ; 

 interopercular lanceolate, widening backwards, somewhat pointed in front, 

 abruptly round-cuneate behind, with a triangular projection between the 

 opercular and preopercular. Occiput regularly concave behind, except a 

 backward swell in the middle. Whole surface of the head handsomely sculp- 

 tured, the vertex rather deeply so ; on the snout and the sides and base of the 

 head the embossed lines tend to become broken into granules. 



Pectoral fins separated from the operculum by a single diagonal series of 

 scales ; the ventral fins midway between the extremities, situated on the di- 

 agonal series which embraces the 17th scale in the dorsal row ; anal fin a lit- 

 tle more than its width from the caudal, interrupting the 38th 42d diagonal 

 series of scales ; dorsal fin of the same width as the anal, and situated so that 

 the la?t three rays fall in the rear of it ; pectoral fins narrow, sharply rounded 



[Aug, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 185 



at the extremity, with the middle ray the longest ; ventral fins relatively 

 broader, rounded, with the second and third rays the longest, the last ray be- 

 ing the width of the fin shorter than the first ; anal fin a little shorter than 

 the ventral, hut twice as broad, rounded, with the 3d and 4th rays the long- 

 est ; caudal fin symmetrically and elliptically rounded at the extremity ; the 

 first (upper) ray reaching a little further back than the last ; the first three 

 rays considerably smaller than tbe last three, so that the sixth ray falls in 

 the middle ; skin terminating in a line stretching si^moidally backwards from 

 below to above, so that the base of the last ray is two-thirds the width of the 

 tail anterior to the base of the first ray. A series of scales diminishing in 

 size continues along the first and last rays of the caudal, and the first ray of 

 all the other fins. 



Ray formula : D. 8 ; C. 11 ; A. 8 ; V. 6 ; P. 9. 



The ground color is pale yellowish-white, becoming deeper on the sides and 

 back, and nearly white below. This is varied by a system of pale bhick macu- 

 lation, which, along the back, conceals most of the ground color, and on the 

 sides, about half of it, while the belly is almost spotless. On most parts of 

 the body the maculae are irregular, with a tendency ou the sides to elonga- 

 tion beyond the length of one or two scales. On the top of the head and the 

 operculum they become sharply defined circular spots, with intermediate 

 blackish dots, while the throat is spotted in the style of the breast of a 

 partridge. The fins are all maculate with oval, badly detined spots. 



Measurements. Total length 32-5 inches. Length of head from snout to 

 occiput 6 - 8 ; to posterior margin of operculum 7*7 ; length of tail on the 

 middle line 4 ; upper jaw to angle of mouth 4 ; width of snout one-fourth 

 inch back from nostrils 0-62 ; width at angle of mouth 1*5 ; width of neck 

 between posterior margins of opercula 2-2 ; greatest height of body 3 ; great- 

 est width 3 ; height of head at occiput 2 ; at angle of mouth 8 ; length 

 from tip of muzzle to insertion of pectoral 6-7 ; to insertion of ventral 9 ; to 

 insertion of anal 17 ; diameter of orbit - 57. 



Comparisons. In form, this species approximates most nearly to Cylindros- 

 tcus latirostris, Girard, from Texas. It differs specifically in having a larger 

 orbit, the operculum and cheek less elongated behind it, the muzzle tapering 

 a little more rapidly, and two or three fewer scales in an oblique series. The 

 color, besides, is much less uniform, and the habitat remote. From C. pla- 

 tostomus, Rafinesque, it differs in having the caudal fin more nearly symmetri- 

 cal ; rays of ventral fin not cartilaginous ; pectoral longer, narrower and 

 straighter. The caudal has one more ray, and the anal and pectoral each one 

 less. The snout widens less rapidly, and the scales are more rhombic. The 

 coloration, especially the sharply defined circular spots, is strikingly peculiar. 

 No spots, however, exist on the median line behind the anal fin. There are 

 no other described species with which the present one requires to be compared, 

 unless it be C. albus and C. longirostris of Rafinesque, and L. gracilis, Agassiz. 

 The two former are very doubtful species, and the description of the latter is 

 not at present accessible to me.. 



The following is now a list of the described species of Lepidosteidae, ar- 

 ranged under three genera, discriminated according to information at hand. 

 No attempt is made, at present, to exhibit the complicated synonymy, as the 

 result would necessarily be too imperfect, from the want of adequate means 

 of comparison.

 to be convergent interiorly.

heavy, and are very pilose. The eyes are large and very prominent. The 

 dorsum is slightly convex, and is ornamented on each side by a broad fuscous 

 stripe, which is intersected by numerous, indistinct, dark lines. 



The scuta are very smooth, and have no distinct lateral plates, but their 

 edges are rather thin and strongly elevated. The penultimate scutum is much 

 broader than its neighbors. The last scutum is very small. The feet are dark 

 colored. There are two or three specimens in the possession of the Academy, 

 which, I believe, were collected by Dr. John L. Le Conte, U. S. A., in the moun- 

 tains of Georgia. 



Family BIPUONOPHORIDJE. 



Genus BRACHYCYBE. 



Rostrum acutum, brevissimum, antennis multo breviore. 



I have never studied the allied genus Siphonophora of Brandt, but, if the 

 characters relied on by that author are at all generic, there can be no doubt 

 that the American species belongs to a distinct genus. In the Siphonophora 

 the rostrum or mouth is very much elongated, and approaches the antennae in 

 length. In Brachycybe the latter are several times the longer. 



B. leconth, Wood. 



Fulvo-brunneus? dorsomodice convexo, medio leviter canaliculato; antennis 

 parvis, filiformibus, pilosis ; scutorum superficie asperata, obscure transverse 

 canaliculata ; scuto postremo postice spina? obtusse serie instructo ; laminis 

 lateralibus longis, angustis, vix sejunctis ; segmentis 47 ; pedibus breve pilosis. 



In our specimens, which have been preserved for a long time in alcohol, the 

 color is a light yellowish-brown. The anterior scuta are tuberculate, the pos- 

 terior merely roughened. Each has a more or less obsolete transverse groove 

 extending along the lateral lamina. The latter are very long and narrow ; they 

 are placed very close together, and are often bent slightly backwards. Their 

 external margin is somewhat oblique, and is furnished in all except, perhaps, 

 the most anterior, with a pore. The small feet are entirely concealed beneath 

 the broad body. The male genital appendages consist of two pairs of acute 

 feet-like processes. It affords me much pleasure to dedicate this species to 

 Surgeon John L. Le Conte, U. S. A., as an acknowledgement of the many as- 

 sistances which he has afforded me in the prosecution of my studies.

Note on the PARALEPIDOIDS and MICROSTOMATOIDS, and on some Pecu- 

 liarities of Arctic Ichthyology. 



BY THEODORE GILL. 



My attention having been attracted to the resemblance between the Alepido- 

 sauroids and Paralepidoids, shortly after my article on new species of the 

 former family, I embraced the oppjrtunity, when in Philadelphia, to examine 

 the specimens of the two genera, 1'aralepis and Sudis, in the Bonaparte col- 

 lection, secured by the liberality of Dr. Wilson. The suspicions of the close 

 affinity of the two families were fully confirmed, and the same logic that would 

 prove the Alepidosauroids to be Siluroids, would cover the Paralepidoids. 

 Nearly equally erroneous would be the reference of those families to the Scom- 

 broid group, near which I formerly retained it with Lowe. The Paralepidoids 

 are, indeed, chiefly distinguished from the Alepidosauroids by the small dorsal 

 fin, and the more posterior ventrals, and wherever one is placed, the other 

 must be approximated next to it. 



The species of this family of Paralepidoids are divisible among three groups, 



1864.] 




183 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



whose relations and differential characters are expressed in the following 

 table : 



I. Head acutely conic ; snout pointed, and oral cleft nearly recti- 



linear. Teeth of lower jaw part enlarged, slender and pointed, 



part small and slender Paralepis. 



a. Dorsal fin decidedly in front of ventrals Arctozenus. 



p. Dorsal fins opposed to ventrals Paralepis. 



II. Head blunt, and oral cleft curved upwards towards the end. 



Teeth of lower jaw partially erect, compressed, dagger-shaped, 



partially directed forwards Scdis. 



The distribution of these three groups is most remarkable. Paralepis and 

 Sudis are types as yet only known to be represented in the Meditteranean 

 Sea, while Arctozenus is represented by a single species, hitherto only fouod in 

 the waters of Greenland, and yet there is the closest affinity between Paralepis 

 and the Arctic type, so close, indeed, that only since the opportunity afforded 

 to examine the detailed figures of Kroyer, have we been able to fully appreci- 

 ate their distinctive characters. In order to assist less fortunate naturalists, 

 the following diagnosis of the newly named subgenus is given. 



ARCTOZENUS, Gill. 



Head elongated conical, attenuated towards the snout, with the snout ^ap- 

 pointed, the jaws straight, the lower behind mostly covered by the upper, and 

 little exposed along the sides ; the teeth of the lower jaw, along the anterior 

 half, enlarged, but slender, recurved and distant ; along the posterior half, 

 minute, acute and approximated ; the dorsal fin behind the middle, but con- 

 siderably in front of the ventrals. 



Type. Paralepis borealis, Reinh. 



In the family of Microstomatoids,* which is related to the Paralepidoids, we 

 find the same peculiarity in geographical distribution ; the genus JUierostomaf 

 being confined to the Mediterranean, while in the Greenland seaB a closely re- 

 lated representative is found. 



Still another case of similar, or rather even more remarkable character, is 

 exhibited by the Stomiadoids. This family, distinguished by the com- 

 bination of an enormous mouth, and the opposition of the dorsal and 

 anal fins, is composed of two genera, Stomias and Malacosteus. The former 

 is represented by apparently closely related species, respectively inhabiting the 

 Mediterranean and Greenland Seas, while of Malacosteus, a single species dis- 

 covered south of the Newfoundland Bank has been described. As, on account 

 of the misconceptions of the author of the last named genus, it has been in- 

 volved in considerable mystery, a diagnosis of it, with reference to its ally, 

 may be useful ; but I desire expressly to add, that I do not hold myself respon- 

 sible for any of the facts, not having seen the original specimen, and that the 

 statement of the absence of scales, &c, requires to be confirmed, although it 

 is quite probable that none exist. The original describer has denied to the 

 genus branchiostegal rays ! 



MALACOSTEUS, Ayres. 



Proc. Boston Nat. Hist. Soc. Boston Journ. N. H. vi., 53 64. 



Body elongated claviform, constricted only at the caudal peduncle ; without 

 scalis ; with the head very convex, and protuberant in front of the eyes; the 

 opercular and tympanic regions very oblique, the opercular bones reduced, the

 and Valenciennes, I think that I am able to distinguish it in specimens of the M. rotundatum, 

 preserved in the collection of the Academy.

oral cleft rectilinear ; teeth of the upper jaw minute ; of the lower, in front, 

 enlarged, but unequal, elongated, recurved and acute; behind minute; at the 

 symphisis directed forwards; small, acute and hooked, and in a double row on 

 the tongue ; palate smooth ; caudal very small, convex ; pectorals inserted 

 very low, linear, of few rays closely connected ; ventrals scarcely behind the 

 middle, with about six rays, the external (except the outermost) of which are 

 produced. Intestine with a flexure. 



Type. Malacosteus niger, Ayres. 



"The principal points on which" Mr. Ayres would "particularly insist, as 

 characteristic of the species and the genus, are the remarkable small size of 

 the head, and, in contrast with this, the immense developement of the whole 

 facial and branchial apparatus, and all that pertains to the mouth and throat, 

 the singular and but partially explained organ on the cheek ; and, most of all, 

 the embryonic condition of the entire osseous system." In all respects perhaps 

 even the last the genus resembles Stomias. Sir John Richardson has suggested 

 that the want of ossification may be due to the preservation of the fish in 

 weak alcohol, but I am scarcely disposed to accept that hypothesis, and would 

 even believe that Stomias itself may be found to have an imperfectly ossified 

 skeleton, but not, perhaps, in so marked degree as Malacosteus. 



In the consideration of the faunistic anomalies here enumerated, we may be 

 aided in a solution of the causes by the consideration of nearly similar peculi- 

 arities in the Ichthyology of the Scandinavian seas. There alone in the more 

 northern seas, species of the genera Deryx and Batrachus, closely allied to or 

 undistinguishable from Mediterranean or tropical species, are found, and there 

 also has been discovered Pterycombus, a genus whose affinities are with the trop- 

 ical Pteraclides. No representatives are found at intermediate places along the 

 European coasts. Again, along the Rhode Island and neighboring coasts have 

 already been found Sarothrodus, Priacanthus, and Hyporthodus, the last closely 

 related to Serranus. All the places enumerated are near the borders of 

 the Gulf Stream. How far the distribution of these genera is thereby affected 

 it is not my intention to now discuss, my desire being simply to draw attention 

 to the facts. Further details regarding their balhy metrical, as well as geograph- 

 ical, distribution are desirable. 



Synopsis of the CYCLOPTEROIDS of Eastern North America. 



BY THEODORE GILL. 



The description of a new species of Liparis, from the Arctic seas, is here 

 submitted, and attention is called to some points in the synonymy of other 

 species of the genus which require elucidation. To complete a view of the 

 family to which they belong, I enumerate the Cyclopterinse. The family is re- 

 stricted, with Gunther, to those fishes whose suctorial disk is fi rmed by the 

 union of the ventral fins, and which have numerous pyloric caica, as it is not 

 evident that there is any close relation between such and the Gobiesocoids. 



CYCLOPTERW.E, Bon. 

 Cvclopteroids with a ventricose body and two dorsal fins, the first of which is 

 mall, and composed of spines ; the second, as well as anal, short, and ob- 

 liquely opposed to each other; and with the caudal vertebrae in scarcely in- 

 creased number, (Vert. 12+16 pm.) 



Genus CYCLOPTERUS, L. 

 Lumpus, Cuv. 



Cyclopterinse with dorsal region elevated in front, larger plates disposed in 

 an unpaired dorsal row and two lateral and one abdominal on each side ; the eyes 

 small and anterior ; the branchial apertures just above the pectoral fins; the 

 spinous dorsal almost concealed, and the ventral disk small.

 and with caudal vertebrae in greatly increased number, (Vert. 10 12+25 50. 



Genus LIPARIS, (Art.) Linn. 

 Cyclogaster Gron. 



Liparidina with a nearly or quite horizontal oral cleft : longer upper jaw ; 

 pluriserial tricuspid teeth ; a well developed ventral disk ou the breast, below or 

 partially behind the posterior half of the head ; the anus little in advance of 

 the anterior third of the length, and the origin of the anal fin not far be- 

 hind it. 



Type. Cyclopterus liparis L. 



This genus, even after the elimination of the L. iunicata of Kroyer, exhibits 

 considerable variation, especially in the relations of the dorsal and anal fins 

 to the caudal, these fins being, in some species, completely isolated, while in 

 others they are coalescent, and united in an almost anguilliform posterior fin. 

 In the latter, the nostrils also appear to be simple, while in the former the 

 posterior ones are tubular. These differences appear still further to be co- 

 incident with a disparity in the number of caudal vertebrae, and of the rays of 

 the vertical fins. Nevertheless, it is not deemed advisable to generically sepa- 

 rate the types so distinguished. 



But the differences between the Liparis tunicata of Kroyer, (Tidskrift, ser. 3, 

 B. i., 236), and the typical Liparides, appear to indicate a more decided de- 

 marcation, and the morpholological differences mentioned in the analytical 

 table are apparently coincident with difference in size ; it is, therefore, proba- 

 ble that the specie3 is the type of a distinct genus, for which the name of 

 Actinochir would be appropriate. For the present, however, it is retained in 

 the genus Liparis. 



The increase of our knowledge of the Greenland Liparidinse, since the pub- 

 lication of the " Catalogue of the Fishes of the Eastern Coast," is chiefly due 

 to Dr. Kroyer, who, appreciating the imperfection of our information, has 

 favored us with a monograph of those species. This has chiefly served as the 

 basis of the present article. ^ 



I omit, for the present, references to the Liparides of the British northern 

 travellers.

In the synonymy of Liparis lineata, I have only included the references to 

 the Greenland fish, without, by any means, undertaking to decide between 

 Drs. Kroyer and Liitken, the former of whom considers the Greenland fish en- 

 tirely distinct from the Cyclopterus lineatus of Lepechin, while the latter consid- 

 ers it the same, and also identical with the Liparis vulyaris of Europe, but still 

 retains the name Liparis lineata, as Lepechin first gave the distinctive appella- 

 tion. As, therefore, the nomenclature is not affected, Dr. Kroyer retaining the 

 name Liparis lineata for the Greenland fish, I am glad to be able to leave the 

 controversy in statu quo. 



The discrepancies between the radial formula, especially of the caudal fin, 

 of Liparis valgaris of authors and Liparis lineata deserves attention. Thus 

 Giinther assigns to his Liparis vulgaris D. 35 36, A. 27 28, C. 10 ; Lepechin, 

 to his Cyclopterus lineatus, D. 30, P. 26, A. 28, C. 13 ? ; Kroyer, to his Liparis 

 lineatus, D. 13+21, A. 2 + 29, C. 13, P. 34; and Liitken, to his, D. 36, A. 30, 

 G. 14 ? P. 33. and with the results of the latter two my own observations 

 agree. 



Of thirteen English specimens of the so-called Liparis vulgaris of Yarrell, eleven 

 exhibited little distinct coloration on the body, but the dorsal and anal fins were 

 densely dotted, so as to give to those fins, especially when folded, a blackish- 

 blue hue. The pectorals of some, especially towards the superior margin, were 

 also clouded. In one specimen, the head aud body were distinctly marmorated, 

 and delineations like those represented on the head, body and pectorals of 

 Liparis lineatus by Kroyer, and Ij. lineata by Liitken, were observed, but the 

 dorsal and anal were simply dotted as in the ordinary variety, and the delinea- 

 tions themselves were dark lilac on a yellowish ground. The last one, conse- 

 quently, represented the L. lineatus of Lepechin and Liitken, and the others 

 the L. barbatus of Ekstrom and Liitken.

dunrle equals about a fourth of the length of the caudal fin. The head, from 

 the snout to the margin of the auriform projection, almost or quite equals a 

 fourth of the length, while its breadth enters nearly 6 times in the same, and 

 is little greater than the height ; the forehead is depressed, and the snout mod- 

 erately high and decurved. The eyes are just within the anterior half of the 

 head ; the width of the forehead between them equals a third of the head's 

 length. The anterior nostrils are simple ; the posterior tubular. The dorsal 

 and anal are connate with the caudal ; the former united for about a fourth of 

 the length of the caudal, the latter two-fifths. The caudal is convex behind, 

 and forms a seventh of the length. The pectoral enters about 5j times in the 

 length, and the ventral disk ten times.

This species, in general form as well as color, resembles the L. Montagui, but 

 is in other respects widely different. Its relations to the other Greenland 

 species is exhibited in the analytical synopsis ; it is well distinguished by its 

 rusty color. 



Specimens were obtained by the Arctic navigator, Dr. Hayes, at Port Foulke, 

 Greenland, and are preserved in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadel-

Fabricius, in the Fauna Grcenlandica, refers to the Cyclopterus liparis of 

 Linnseus, two forms of Liparis found by him in Greenland. To the first vari- 

 ety " 1) Altera minor, Abopokitsok " were attributed 39 dorsal, 33 anal, 30 

 pectoral, and 14 caudal rays; 4 tubular nostrils; a union of the dorsal and 

 anal fins wi h the caudal, which latter is nearly cuneate, and a fuscous color ; 

 the jaws externally, the inferior ocular region and the opercula have rather 

 indistinct white dots, and the tips of the upper pectoral rays being: likewise 

 white. This combination does not entirely agree with any of the Greenland 

 species, as described by Kroyer, but most approximates to the L. Fabricii; from 

 that species the number of caudal rays, (14) if correctly stated, would sepa- 

 rate it, and the color is also, perlups, inconsistent. I am fain, then, to leave 

 the identity of this species in doubt, trusting that future material may enable 

 ns to arrive at a certain decision. 



[Sept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 193 



la 1835 or 1836, Reinhardt offered to the Danish Academy a Contribution 

 ou new Greenland Fishes, closing this contribution with the remark that 

 " there also exists in the Greenland seas the Cyclopterus liparis, Fab., which is 

 named Liparis tunicata, on account of the peculiar loose adherence of the skin, 

 and which, in its characters, has much similarity with the European species 

 illustrated by Yarrell, in his British Fishes ; but, as the Museum had in its pos- 

 session only one badly preserved specimen, no certain identification could be 

 made."* 



The name L. tunicata is thus solely based on the C. liparis of Fabricius, and 

 as the first variety is the one fully described by that author, and consequently 

 the type of his species, and, as Reinhardt's remarks on the similarity of the 

 species to the European are only correct for that variety, the name L. 

 tunicata must be connected with it. 



But, in a subsequent communication on " Liparis glutinosus," Reinhardt's am- 

 biguous language might lead one to suppose that he connected the name L. 

 tunicatus with only the large variety of Cyclopterus liparis of Fabricius, he re- 

 marking that " Fabricius considered that the large Greenland species, th 

 Liparis tunicatus (sic.) of the Museum, might well be the Stellerian L. gluti- 

 nosus." However this may be, the name proposed by Reinhardt must be ac- 

 cepted with its first limitation, and share with the variety of Fabricius the 

 doubts concerning its proper application. 



The name Liparis Fabricii was subsequently proposed by Kroyer for the spe- 

 cies under consideration, and being the first known to be applicable to it, is 

 provisionally accepted. 



The radial formula given by Giiother differs considerably from that assigned 

 by Kroyer, (B. 5, D. 42, A. 33 35, C. 12, Gthr.) and approximates to that of Fab- 

 ricius, especially in the number of caudal rays.

 Liparis Muntagui Kroyer, Naturhistorisk Tidskrift, ser. 3, B. i., p. 243. 



Only the references to the Greenland form have been given. It may be re- 

 marked that while Kroyer, both in his Denmark's Fiske, (ii., 519) and the 

 Naturhistorisk Tidskrift, has assigned 18 caudal rays to this species, Yarrell, 

 Nilsson and Giiuther have only attributed to it 13 or 14. There are also some 

 slight discrepancies between the proportions assigned to the species by differ- 

 ent authors.

 fully described by Kroyer, under the name Liparis tunicata, oiigiually based, by

 only fully described his first variety, it appears advisable for that reason, as 

 well as on account of its precedence, to identify the name with that one. The 

 name given to the present species as a variety, by Walbaum, may, in that case. 

 be accepted as its specific appellation.

This very distinct genus is especially distinguished from Liparis by the char- 

 acters mentioned in the generic diagnosis. We owe its establishment to Dr. 

 Kroyer, its species having been previously confounded with Liparis. There 

 are probably two species, one found in Kamtschalka, and the other, long con- 

 founded with it, a native of the Greenland waters.

Synopsis of the PLEURONECTOIDS of California and North-western 



America. 



BY THEODORE GILL. 



In conformity with a promise some time since made,* I now offer a Synopsis 

 of the Pleuronectoids of California, and add descriptions of a new species, 

 which is at the same time the type of a distinct genus, contained in a collection 

 made by Dr. Cooper, of the Geological Survey of California, and kindly sub- 

 mitted to me for examination. 



One of the genera admitted Uropsetta is known to me only Ihrough the de- 

 scription and outline figure of its type published by Dr. Ayres. That species was 

 originally described as Ilippoglossus calif ornicus, but as it evidently did not be- 

 long to Hippoglossus, it was withdrawn by me from that genus, and taken as 

 the type of a peculiar one. It has since been referred to ihe genus Pseudo- 

 rhombus by Giinther, but the Californian naturalist, in approximating it to Hip- 

 poglossus, appea-s to have interpreted nature more truly than the English one. 

 Uropsctla, indeed, is apparently more closely related to Reinhardtius than to 

 any other. 



Four other species are only known through descriptions that are not suffi- 

 cient to positively decide their true affinities. One is the Platessa bilineata 

 of Ayres ;f of this the "mouth, of moderate dimensions, the tip of the upper 

 maxillary scarcely reaching the plane of the pupil of the lower eye ; " the " sin- 

 gle, even row of strong, blunt, conical teeth;" the dextral eyes; the "scales 

 larger and more conspicuous than in any other fish of this tribe yet found on 

 our coast; " and the recurrent lateral line appears to indicate that it is allied 

 to Lepidopsetta ; but the statement that " the scales of the anterior portion of the 

 body are nearly smooth : further back they become gradually more and more

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 195 



ciliate, though none of them are so rough as in most Flatfishes. Those of the 

 head cover the entire opercular region and cheeks, and in part also the inner- 

 ocular ridge ; those of the cheeks are strongly ciliate," forbid us to associate it 

 in the same genus as L. umbrosa. If, however, tuberculated scales should be 

 substituted for ciliated ones, nothing else in the description would militate 

 against such a reference. Dr. Ayres, indeed, considers this species to be "al- 

 lied to P. dentata, Mitch.," but as his ideas of affinity are extremely crude and 

 unreliable, nothing may be learned from them. 



The second has been named by Dr. Gunther Parophrys Ayrcsii. The " broad 

 band of villiform teeth on the blind side, and with a few on the colored one," 

 approximates it to the same group as Hypsopsetta and Pleuronichthys. The 

 mere statement that " the dorsal fin commences somewhat before the middle 

 of the eye," and the neglect to describe the lips furnish us negative evidence 

 of some weight that it is not congeneric with Pleuronichthys ccenosvs * in which 

 the dorsal is decurrent in front on the blind side, and the lips are plicated as in 

 Labroids, characters which would not be overlooked by an observant natural- 

 ist. As in Hypsopsetta, the normal characters of those parts are presented, and 

 as Parophrys Ayresii otherwise exhibits a concordance with that genus, it may 

 be provisionally referred to it. 



The third species native of the seas between Kamtschatkaand America has 

 been named by Pallas Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus, and has recently been re- 

 ferred by Dr. Gunther to the genus Parophrys. The description of Pallas is 

 perhaps insufficient to enable us to form a certain conclusion regarding its affi- 

 nities, but the characters given smooth body with rudimentary scales, lateral 

 line very little decurrent anteriorly, and four tubercles on the head continu- 

 ous with the lateral line are characters found in Pleuronectes rather than in 

 Parophrys. The cause of its reference by Gunther to the latter genus is unknown, 

 but whatever it may be, he has evidently entirely misunderstood that genus. 

 Until we are better acquainted with the Pallasian species, it may be advisable 

 to retain it in Pleuronectes, since no advantage would be gained by exchanging 

 one doubt for another far greater. 



A fourth species Pleuronectes cicatricosus Pallas is also apparently a true 

 Pleuronectes.

* Dr. Gunther has referred Pleuronichthys ceenosus, Grd., to Pleuronectes, and PI. guttulalux to 

 Parophrys. His reasons for thus widely separating thein have not been given, and are not obvi- 

 ous from a simple acquaintance with the literature or the species themselves. His chaiacters of. 

 Parophrys are applicable to both species, but not to those of Parophrys.

 the first under eighth dorsal ray; the second above the axil of pectoral; the sixth under sixth 

 ray from last, and the intervening equidistant, but the fourth lower; four anal correspond to the 

 last four dorsal ones. In the sinistral specimen, there is also one behind the eye. In the second 

 specimen in the collections, these spots are obsolete. Paralichthys is distinguished from Chxnvp- 

 ietta by its larger ctenoid scales, and small supernumerary linear cycloid ones.

 the Geological Survey of California. 



Genus METOPONOPS Gill. 



Body rather elongated rhomboid, with the dorso-nasal outline nearly recti- 

 linear, and with the caudal peduncle moderate, somewhat constricted. 



Scales moderate, cycloid, oblong, or oval, imbricated, covered also with 

 smaller supernumerary scales. Lateral line perfectly straight, but slightly 

 decurrent anteriorly, continuous in simple tubes on each scale. 



Head scaly, moderate, conic, with the oblique profile rectilinear; the snout 

 somewhat elevated and subtruncated, and the interorbital ridge prominent 

 sideways. Eyes sinistral, oval, rather large, situated almost entirely in the 

 anterior half of the head, the lower lateral ; the upper directed obliquely up- 

 wards : the interorbital area narrow, scaly, channelled between the eyes, and 

 borderel by two ridges which converge above behind. Nostrils narrow, be- 

 tween snout and eyes and parallel with the former; the anterior with a long 

 Map or bridle in front; the posterior simple. Opercula normal. 



Mouth large and very oblique ; the supramaxillary ceasing under the pupil 

 of the eye, extended obliquely downwards behind, and with a semicircular 

 arch at its upper angle. Lower jaw truncated in front, with a tubercle be- 

 low. Lips very thin and simple. Tongue elongated, narrow and free. 



Teeth equally developed on both sides, uniserial, approximated, subequal, 

 ratber small, curved conic and acute. Palate unarmed. 



Branchiostegal rays seven. Branchial membrane deeply emarginated below. 



Dorsal fin with its origin considerably behind the right posterior nostril, above 

 or rather behind the anterior margin of the orbit, regularly arched, with its 

 rays simple. Anal with its origin under or behind the inferior axil of the pec- 

 toral, and similar to the dorsal.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 199 



Caudal fin convex behind. 



Pectoral fins pointed. 



Ventral fins subjugular, inserted obliquely, with its. rays approximated, and 

 its innermost attached to the breast by a membrane. 



The lower pharyngeal bones are entirely separated, compressed and laminar, 

 with the body emarginated below and the posterior processes directed up- 

 wards, attenuated towards their ends ; with the teeth pauciserial ; of the inner 

 row slender, elongated and acute, curved outwards in front and erect behind; 

 of the outer much smaller, but similar in form. Upper pharyngeals three on 

 each side laminar, each with a row of large, slender, curved teeth. 



The branchial arches have compressed, pointed rakers, progressively de- 

 creasing in length from the first to the fourth arch, on which last they are 

 ehort and triangular ; each armed with small, slender teeth on their internal 

 margins. 



Metoponops is readily distinguishable by the characters above given, espe- 

 cially the prominence of the interorbital ridge and the consequent oblique po- 

 sition on the forehead of the upper eye, whose line of vision is upwards ; the 

 scaly channel of the ridge itself; straight lateral line ; dentition, and the form 

 of the lower pharyngeal bones, especially the paraboloid emargination below 

 in front. It is apparently as closely related to its cohabitant of California, 

 Orlhopsetta, as any other, but that genus is at once distinguished by its com- 

 pressed head and little prominent, narrow interorbital ridge. 



Metoponops Cooperi Gill. 



The height of the body is contained about three times in the total length; 

 the head about four times, and the caudal six times and a half. The longitu- 

 dinal diameter of either orbit equals about a third of the head's length. The 

 snout is rhomboid, decurVed in front, and its length from the lower orbit to 

 the symphisis equals about a fifth of the head's length. The supramaxillary 

 ends under the front of the pupil, and from the symphisis to its end enters 

 twice in the distance between the chin and preopercular margin. The greatest 

 height of the dorsal equals the length of the upper jaw, as well as does that 

 of the anal. The pectoral fin equals about a sixth of the total length.

The color is uniform brownish. 



A single adult specimen of this species is in the collection formed by the 

 Californian Geological Survey, of which Prof. Whitney is the superintendent, 

 and was obtained by Dr. Cooper, the naturalist of the Snrvey, at Santa Bar- 

 bara, in May, 1863. This specimen is in poor condition, having been appa- 

 rently obtained only after exposure for some time to the sun ; the fins have 

 been dried, and the pectorals and ventrals are more or less broken, especially 

 the latter, while the abdomen is much injured. I am consequenily compelled 

 to omit some desirable details. The species itself is a very interesting one, 

 and I give myself the pleasure of dedicating it to my friend, Dr. Cooper. 



On the Afiinities of several doubtful BRITISH FISHES. 



BY THEODORE GILL. 



Among the few still uncertain species of British fishes, none are involved 

 in greater obscurity than those presented under the name of Ophidium imberbe 

 by Pennant and Montague, and those referred by Hoy to the Linmean Trichi- 

 urus leplurus. A detailed investigation into the literature and history of the 

 former has enabled me to demonstrate its relations, and the discovery of a 

 recent type in the Caribbean Sea permits me to at least suggest the affini- 

 ties of the latter,* concerning which I had long been perplexed. These con-

tnbutions to British Ichthyology are, with this introduction, especially sub- 

 mitted to the naturalists of Britain, to whom it remains to verify or disprove 

 the validity of the conclusions arrived at. I shall only remark that the fail- 

 ure, after so long a period, to find any species more conformable to the notice 

 of Ophidium imberbe than the one herewith identified with it, is itself most 

 suggestive. 



1. Ophidium imberbe L., Montag. 



For half a century a nominal species of fish has been retained in the cata- 

 logues of the British fishes under the name of "Ophidium imberbe L.," and in 

 later times under that of " Gymndis imberbis." As no critical investigation 

 into the history of this species has yet been given, it is thought that such 

 will not now be superfluous, since thereby a name symbolic of no distinct 

 organismmay be eliminated from the systematic and faunistic works, and 

 the false ideas connected in recent times by means of it with the geographi- 

 cal distribution of two remarkable genera be dissolved. 



Commencing with the general introduction of the binomial nomenclature, 

 Lmnjeus, in the tenth edition of the Systema Natura?,* defined anew the 

 genus Ophidion,f then placed by him at the end of the Jugulares, and assigned 

 to it five branchiostegal rays, and ventral fins with two rays, the external of 

 which is spinous. In the genus thus defined, he respectively placed, 1. O. bar- 

 batum, 2. 0. imberbe. 3. 0. macrophthalmum. The first has articulated bifid ven- 

 tral fins modified as barbels,! situated below the chin, and is the type of a 

 family closely related to the Brotuloids and Gadoids. The third is evidently 

 the species afterwards described as Cepola rubescens by Linna5us,|| as was sub- 

 sequently shown by Linnaeus^ and Cuvier.** Thus, neither of these species 

 answered to the terms of the diagnosis. The Ophidium imberbe was noticed 

 in the words " 0. maxillis imberbibus, cauda obtusiuscula, D. 19. P. 11. V. 

 2. A. 41. C. 18. Hab. in Europa." This diagnosis, in connection with the 

 notice of the ventrals in the generic diagnosis, enables us at once to identify 

 the species with the common gunnell of Europe, no other having even ap- 

 proximately such a radial formula. But references are made to the 0. cirris 

 carens of Artediff and the Fauna Suecica.%% Artedi based his species in the 

 " Synonymia" on, 1st, the Ophidian flavum vel Ophidion imberbe of Rondeletg 

 and the notices of the same derived from Rondelet by Willoughby|||| and 

 Ray; and, 2d, the Ophidion flavum imberbe of Schonevelde^f and Ophidion of

% I have already shown that the so-called barbels of Ophidion barbatum are true ventral fins on 

 account of their articulation and attachment, and not homologues with the barbels of the Mul- 

 loids and Polymyxioids. 



(S The Brotuloids form a very natural family, but its distinctive characters have hitherto been 

 only hinted at. Anions' the most trenchant are the closure of the cranial cavity in front and the 

 consequent development of a more or less complete bony septum ; the compression downwards of 

 the sides of the cranium and angularity below, and the great development of the exoccipitais, 

 which unite and extend obliquely upwards behind the supraoccipital : the forms of the supramax- 

 illars already described by me, and the development of a genital papilla in the males.

Schelhammer* The first is a fish of the Mediterranean, closely resembling 

 the Ophidium barbatum, according to Rondelet, but distinguished by its want 

 of barbels and its yellow color; it has been identified by Cuvierf with his 

 " Bonzelle imberbe" the Fierasfer acus Kaup. The second was evidently based 

 on the Murxnoides gunnellm of authors, as BroussonetJ and Cuvierg have 

 shown. The Ophidion cirris carens of the " Synonymia" is therefore a com- 

 pound ; that of the " Genera" is only based on the Ophidion flavum $ imberbe 

 Auctoruin," (Schonevelde,) and said to inhabit the Baltic Sea; itisthus 

 primarily the Murienoides gunnellm. Artedi was apparently not acquainted 

 through autopsy with any of his Ophidia. 



The Ophidion of the Fauna Suecica, placed among the Jugulares, is also, 

 without doubt, the Murserioides gvnnellus, of which Linnaeus had not then men- 

 tioned the ventral fins. The formula of the fins in the tenth edition of the 

 Systema is similar, but with the addition of the rays of the ventrals. 



Subsequently, Gronovius, in the Zoophylacium,|| connected this name with 

 a fish which appears to be nothing more than an Ophidion barbatum, of which 

 the barbels had been destroyed, as Cuvierf suggests, or concealed within the 

 limbs of the lower jaw and overlooked, as may readily be the case. We 

 might have hoped to have had this question solved by Dr. Giinther, as, ac- 

 cording to Dr. Gray,** the Gronovian fish was in the collection purchased for 

 the British Museum ; Dr. Giinther has, however, not referred to the specimen 

 in his Catalogue. 



Pennantff next affixed the same name to a fish found near Weymouth, and 

 communicated to him by the Duchess of Portland, giving a figure of it in 

 the fourth volume of his British Zoology, but no description. This fish is 

 apparently a common eel, as BroussonetJJ and Cuvierf have suggested ; pro- 

 bably Peunant and his friends were deceived by some anomalous appearance 

 of the fish itself, as it appears to have been shorter than usual. There is, at 

 least, nothing but the eel found in European or, indeed, any other waters, 

 which at all resembles the fish figured by Pennant. |j|| 



In a subsequent edition of the British Zoology, this figure was replaced by 

 one in the meanwhile published by Montague under the name of Ophidium 

 imberbe. 



Such is the essential history of the applications of the name of Ophidium 

 imberbe down to the year 1777. The age of compilers, commencing with 

 Haiiy and culminating in Lac^pede, Bloch, Schneider and Shaw, soon after 

 commenced. These authors variously combined the notices of their prede- 

 cessors, and finally succeeded in involving a species, concerning which there 

 was no reasonable room for doubt, in such mystery that almost all memory 

 of the original type was eventually lost.

f Mr. Tempi ton. in 1837, announced that " the only specimen (of O. imberbe) I have observed, 

 was thrown on jhe shores of Belfast Lough, near the White House Point, on January 9, 1809. It 

 was a large specimen, not less than a foot long, and agreed so exactly with the figure in the British 

 Zoology, and differed so much from that of Mr. Montague (Wern. Mem., p. 95, pi. 4), that I am led 

 to believe there are two distinct species, of which Pennant has described one and Montague the 

 other." Mag. Nat. Hist, N. S., i. 412. Mr. Thompson (N. H. Ireland, iv. 1850, p. 233), was unable 

 to gain further information. If the specimen was not a thick eel, it may have been a Zoarces 

 viviparus.

tion of the "Imberbe" Ophidion imberbe, the colors as well as very low dor- 

 sal fin from Rondelet, but at the same time described the dorsal with Schone- 

 velde as a very stiff, rigid one still considering it a Malacopterygian! Also 

 stating that, according to Gronovius, there were 147 dorsal rays and 101 anal, 

 among which the caudal were included, he recalled that Linnaeus distin- 

 guishes the three fins, assigning to the dorsal 79 rays, to the anal 41 and to 

 the caudal 18, and the combination of these, according to our author, forms 

 238 (sic !) rays, 10 less than that which results from the enumeration of Gro- 

 novius ! He concludes by giving with Gronovius quite large, lanceolate pec- 

 torals with 26 rays ; and, finally, with remarks on its habitat from Rondelet. 

 The description is thus based only on three species belonging certainly to as 

 many very distinct families ; but, in his synonymy, he includes references to 

 the Sea snail of Petiver* and the Congrus of Aldrovandi,f the one represent- 

 ing a Liparis, and the other a true Conger, representatives of two more fami- 

 lies. It must, however, be added, somewhat in extenuation for Haiiy, that 

 the last two, singularly enough, originated with Gronovius, perhaps the most 

 sagacious and learned ichthyologist of the past century. 



Bonnaterre,J engaged on the same great work, followed Haiiy, and con- 

 cluded his notice with the radial formula B. 7. D. 238. P. 26. V. 0. A. 

 0. C. 0., which is evidently the result for the dorsal of the sum so singu- 

 larly obtained by Haiiy from the combination of the numbers attributed by 

 Linnasus to the dorsal, anal and caudal fins, while the numbers of the pectoral 

 and brauchiostegal rays are derived from Gronovius; the negation of the 

 anal and caudal fins is peculiar to the author himself. 



Gmeling included in the synonymy of the Linnaean species the references 

 to the Ophidion of Gronovius, placing the radial formula of the latter im- 

 mediately under that of Linnajus, as if to draw attention to the remarkable 

 difference between the two which he could not himself appreciate, and also 

 referred to Pennant's figure. 



Walbaum,|| in his edition of the " Genera of Artedi," simply added the 

 notices from the Fauna Suecica and Schonevelde, as well as a reference to 

 the figure of Pennant, with the opinion of Broussonet concerning the same. 



Lac6pede1[ obtained from Linnaeus, for his notice, the rounded caudal fin 



and radial formula, aud from Rondelet the yellow color and its Mediterranean 



habitat, while his information regarding the delicacy of its flesh in common 



with that of the O. barbatum is orginal, and serves well to open a paragraph. 



Shaw** copied his notice from Gronovius. 



Bloch, or his editor, Schneider, gave to the species the name Ophidium 

 " Chinense''' 7 at the same time depending entirely on the Fauna Suecica of Lin- 

 naeus for information relative to its habitat, (" Habitat in mart baltico et oceano, 

 reperitur ssepe intra ostrearum testas,") ; and, while also deriving his knowledge 

 of its characters for his text from the same source, copied Pennant's figure 

 as illustrative at once of the species and the genus. ff 



Cuvier arising, dispelled the obscurity which involved the history of so 

 many of the most common European Fishes in his remarkable series of Mem- 

 oirs on the Fishes of the Mediterranean. In that on the Ophidium imberbe, 

 (De la Donzelle imberbe,) he demonstrated that the Ophidium imberbe of Ron- 

 delet, and his copyist Willoughby, was distinct from that of Schonevelde, 

 Schelhammer and Linnasus ; that the first was related to Ophidium barbatum, 

 and the second identical or very closely allied with the Blennius gunnellus of 

 Linnasus ; that the O. imberbe of Gronovius was a true Ophidium deprived of

barbels, and that Pennant's fish was an eel.* He was unable to determine a 

 fish noticed by Montague under the same name. While therefore the Ophidium 

 imberbe was eliminated from the Catalogues of Fishes of Continental Europe 

 as a distinct species, it still held a position among those of England. To the 

 consideration of this English fish we now proceed. 



In 1811, in the Memoirs of the Wernerian Society, Montaguef described 

 and figured the fish identified by him with the Ophidium imberbe It was 

 " taken on the south coast of Devon," and in " length was about three inches ;" 

 the body " ensiform ;" "the dorsal fin commences immediately above the 

 base of the pectoral, and is at first not so broad, and usually not so erect as 

 the other part," and the caudal is cuneiform and obtusely pointed. "The 

 color is purplish-brown, disposed in minute speckles; and along the base of 

 the anal fin are about ten small bluish-white spots regularly placed, but 

 scarcely discernible without a lens, possibly peculiar to younger fishes." 

 The rays were respectively pectoral 11; dorsal about 74 ; anal 44 ; caudal 

 18 or 20. Such was the first detailed account of Ophidium imberbe, based on 

 a British fish, and such the authority on which the subsequent British faun- 

 ists have preserved the species in their catalogues. By Turtou,J Fleming,^ 

 Jenyns,|| Yarrell, ^[ Gray,** &c, it has been retained in the genus Ophidium 

 (QFierasfer), while more recently, Kaup,ff Richardson^ and Giinther$$ have 

 transferred it to the genus Gymnclis ; the first originally under the name of 

 Cepolop his. || j] It remains to examine into the grounds for such approxima- 

 tions. 



It is not probable that a fish whose dorsal arrested the attention of Mon- 

 tague on account of its being so " erect," could have been a Malacopterygian, 

 and this character as well as the distinctness of all the rays, the development 

 of the caudal, whose rays are longer than those of the dorsal and anal, the 

 relations of the various parts, and even the gill-membranes inflated beneath, 

 render it evident that the fish in question could have been in no wise related 

 to either Ophidium, Fierasferl or Gymnelisfi all of which are Malacopterygian^, 

 with caudal rays shortest and not developed as a distinct fin. Its affinities are 

 then to be sought for in another direction. The general form, the " erect" 

 dorsal fin and the number of rays, agree with Mursenoides gunnellus. The color 

 is in that species sometimes simply "purplish-brown," the dorsal spots be- 

 coming obsolete, and, in a single specimen from England in the Smithsonian 

 collection, several anal spots are barely discernible. 3 The failure to ob- 

 serve the ventrals was shared with Schonevelde, Schelhammer, Linnaeus, &c, 

 and we are more prepared for their non-observance by Montague when we

1 Fierasfer Cuv., is the type of a peculiar family related to the Opidioids, but with the anuf 

 thoracic or jugular, the body much attenuated backwards, and the anal fin longer and higher 

 than the dorsal : it embraces four genera, Ficras/tr Cuv., or Cdrapus Raf. (not Cuv.), Enchcliophis 

 J. Muell., Ecliiodun Thompson, the latter of which is the only British type, and Uelminlhcdes 

 Gill, (type OxybeUs lumbricoides Blkr.,) distinguished by its very slender form. 



2 Gymnelis Keinh., is the representative of a peculiar family (Lycodoidx), allied to the Brotu- 

 loids, but with the branchial apertures more or less restricted, the ventrals rudimentary or obso- 

 lete, the skull oblique behind, the supraoccipital bone being deflected downwards, wedged between 

 the exoceipitals, and with its point and low crest continued almost orquite to the foramen magnum ; 

 the cranial cavity is open in front, no osseous septum being developed. This family is only repre- 

 sented by the genus Enchelyopus or Zoarces in the European seas, which, as J. Mfiller (Arch, fur 

 Nat., 1843, l. 294) has shown, is truly Malacopterygian.

 mark and the German Ocean.

remember his peculiar views concerning the ventral fins.* Objections may 

 be urged against this identification, that Montague would have recognized 

 the Murxnoides gunnellus ; that the proportions represented in his figure are 

 not precisely equivalent to those of that species, and that the critical Cuvier 

 and all succeeding naturalists have failed to notice the identity. I shall only 

 recall the admission that Linnaeus himself, after autopsy, referred one speci- 

 men of the same species to Blmnius {gunnellus) and another to Ophidion (im- 

 berbe) ; that Montague wrote, in the year 1812, and in the infancy of ichthy- 

 ology, when the importance of attention to minutia 1 was less generally appre- 

 ciated than now, and that the identification of his fish with Murxnoides 

 gunnellus was probably stayed by the improbability of his failure to recognize 

 that common species. 



" As Dr. Giinther, in the synonymy of " Gymnelis imberbis,' 1 ^ has represented 

 the ideas of the English naturalists; and, as his work is the last authority 

 referring to it, an analysis and reduction of that synonymy to its proper ele- 

 ments will form a fitting conclusion to these remarks.

* The reference by Dr. Shaw of Vandellius lusitanicus (= Lepidopus caudatus) to the thoracic 

 order, " caused the obscurity ol Vandellius lusitanicus, as no one could have expected to have 

 found an Apodal fish placed in that division. How that naturalist could have fallen into such an 

 error, 1 cannot conceive, unless he considered the pair of ventral scales as rudiments of those fins, 

 or what is commonly attached to the base of the ventral fins of some fishes, as may be observed 

 in many Spari." "I am aware that it has been contended that these abdominal scales are lamel- 

 lated ventral fins. If so, we have yet to learn the definition of a fin in the modern revolution of 

 science. Those who contend for the continuance of VandeUius of Shaw or few the Lepidope&f 

 Risso being continued in the Thoracic order, mas t also constitute a new order for many fishes 

 that have such lamellated appendages, independent of two ventral fins. But I cannot admit of a 

 simple corneous scale, destitute of motion, being a ventral fin." Montague, in Mem. Mem. Soc., 

 ii. 1818, pp. 43-2, 433. 



t Dr. Gunther remarks, that the Gymnelis stigma and G. imberbis "probably do not belong to 

 this genus." 



Gymnelis stigma Ophidium stigma Lay and Benn. (sic) is probably congeneric with and per- 

 haps even closely related to G. viridis ; and it at least greatly resembles some varieties of that 

 variable species. The poor figure and the assignment of " very small" scales to it led me, on a 

 firmer occasion, to think otherwise, like Dr. Gunther: but we must remember that the notes and 

 illustrations of Ophidium stigma were made by an inexperienced naturalist, and that he may 

 have been deceived as to the presence of scales. However, we may also recall that there is a great 

 variation in sqnamation in a genus representing a closely related subfamily, (Lycodes.) 



X The question will naturally arise among those who contend that we should date our nomen- 

 clature from the tenth edition of the Systema Naturae that being the first in which the binomial 

 system is introduced whether we should not replace the name Mura noides, Centronotus, or Gun- 

 nellus by Ophidion. Perhaps this will eventually be done, since the genus was well defined and 

 its diagnosis only applicable to the O. imberbe. Others may contend that Jhe name must be retained 

 for the first species (O. barbatum) in spite of its total disagreement. The decision of this ques- 

 tion may be suspended till the publication of the new rules of the British Association. 



| The name Girapus was first connected with the Gymnotus acus by Kafinesque (Ind.. 1819, p. 

 37, 57), who only referred to that spec ins, although he doubtless intended his genus to correspond 

 with Lacep&de's anonymous second subgenus of Gymnotus, which included the Gymnotus cara- 

 pus L., G. acus L. (= Fierasfer acus Kaup) and G. rostratus L. (= Bhamphichthys rostratus M., 

 T.) A strict adherence to the laws will, however, necessitate the retention of the same for the 

 only species mentioned (C. acus.) 



A Bleeker is doubtless orreet in retaining the name Mureena for the M. anguilla. The name 

 was restricted to the type represented by that species by Bloch, who first subdivided the genus, 

 and the M. anguilla was evidently the one on which Arttdi and Linnaeus based their diagnoses.

2. "TRICHIURUS LEPTURUS." 



The question which we shall next consider relates to the specimens identi- 

 fied by Mr. James Hoy* with the Trichiurus Upturns of Linnaeus. 



In the Transactions of the Linnasan Society, Mr. Hoy has published an ac- 

 count of two fishes stranded at considerable intervals of time 'upon the 

 shore of the Moray Frith, near the fishing village of Port Gordon." The first 

 specimen was found " on the 2d of November, 1810, after a high wind from 

 the north :" " its head was much broken ;" "the extremity of the upper jaw, 

 or upper part of the mouth, was entire ; upon either side of which was an 

 operculum;" " the body, from the gills to the point of the tail, was three feet 

 two inches long ; its greatest breadth six inches and a quarter, and its great- 

 est thickness only an inch ;" " both sides of the fish were wholly white, 

 without a spot upon them ;" "the dorsal fin was the only part of a different 

 color, being a blackish-green ; this ran all the way back from the gills to the 

 tail ;" " the tail ended in a point, consisting of three or four soft spines or 

 bristles of different lengths, not exceeding two inches. The body was nearly 

 of the same breadth for one half of its length, and then its breadth diminish- 

 ed gradually till within three inches of the tail, when the diminution became 

 more quick. The lateral line was straight, and strongly marked along 

 the middle of the two sides." 



The second specimen was obtained "on the 12th of November, 1812;" 

 " its head had been broken off and was quite gone ; a small bit of the gills 

 only remained about the upper part of the throat, from whence to the ex- 

 tremity of the tail its length was twelve feet nine inches ; its breadth, eleven 

 inches and a quarter, was nearly equal for the first six feet in length from 

 the gills, diminishing gradually from thence to the tail, which endedin a blunt 

 point, without any of those kind of bristles which projected from the tail of 

 the one found formerly; its greatest thickness was two inches and a half ; 

 the distance from the gills to the anus forty-six inches. The dorsal fin ex- 

 tended from the head to the tail," &c. " There were no ventral nor anal fins ; 

 but the thin edge, of the belly was closely muricaled with small hard points, which, 

 although scarcely visible through the skin, were very plainly felt all along it. 

 Both sides of the fish were white, with four longitudinal bars of a darker color ; 

 the one immediately below the dorsal fin was about two inches broad, each of 

 the other three about three-fourths of an inch. The side line straight along 

 the. middle." 



On the authority of these specimens, the Trichiurus Upturns was admitted 

 by the British Faunists in the Catalogues of their fishes. 



Dr. Flemingf considered that the two specimens belonged to different spe- 

 cies. " The differences in the position of the vent, the structure of the tail, 

 and the condition of the edge of the belly, seem too great to justify the in- 

 ference of their being only varie'ies. The latter fish appears identical with 

 the Lepturus of Artedi, and consequently of Linnaeus." 



Subsequently, Dr. FlemingJ considered that "the position assigned to the 

 vent, the absence of ventral fins, and the white color of the sides, (of Hoy's 

 first specimen) all accord with the Deal-fish, (Trachypterus.) The color of 

 the dorsal fin, however, which was of blackish-green, seems to oppose this 

 view, though the dead state of the fish may probably serve to explain this 

 difference, if duly considered." 



Repugnant as must be such perversinnsof names, consideration for the uniformity of nomenclature, 

 which may bpst be attained by strict adherence to the laws, seems to require assent to them. The 

 genus Anguilla is generally attributed to Thunberg, but a search instituted among his various mem- 

 miirs has failed to reveal any mention of it, and it is to be remarked, that no naturalist has re- 

 ferred to any pre -ise work. Prof. Agassiz, indeed, refers to "Anguilla Thunb.. Nuov. Mem. Stock., 

 179 ." but no such generic name is to be found in the series referred to under that title.

206 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



Mr. Jenyns* was inclined to adopt Dr. Fleming's opinion " that the first 

 specimen of Hoy was a distinct species, if not belonging to a different genus. 

 There can be no doubt that the one described above (Hoy's second specimen) 

 was a true Trichiurus, and probably T. Lepturus of Linnaeus and other authors ; 

 but as the description is rather imperfect, and the species of this genus ill 

 determined, it is impossible to speak with certainty on this last point." 



Yarrellf especially alluded to the median lateral line and lateral bands, and 

 remarked that " it is evident that more information on the subject is required; 

 the result of it may be the establishment of Mr. Hoy's second fish as a new 

 species of Trichiurus, and of his first fish, which is evidently distinct from 

 the second, as the type of a new genus, if, as Dr. Fleming has suggested, it 

 was not a mutilated example of the Deal-fish of the Arcadians, Gyninetrus 

 arclicus." 



With enlarged opportunities for arriving at a possible decision concerning 

 at least the second specimen, I proceed to institute inquiries into the nature 

 of these materials. The form and approximately the proportions noticed by 

 Hoy, the "operculum on each side" of the mouth, simulated by the supra- 

 maxillars, the soft dorsal rays, the bristles at the end of the tail, the strongly 

 marked straight lateral line appear to indicate, as Fleming has suggested, 

 that Hoy had before him, in his first specimen, a much injured example of 

 Trachypterus with most of its fins destroyed, and it is probable that a hole, 

 caused by the caducous ventral fin3, mighthave been mistaken for the anus jt 

 this may seem very remarkable, but it is evident that Mr. Hoy has not the 

 slightest claim to scientific consideration, and the bole so created in Trachyp- 

 terus would correspond in space to the " anus" discovered by that gentleman. 

 A thoracic anus is incompatible with the structure of the Trachypteroids or 

 any related forms. The " blackish-green" color of the portion of the dorsal 

 remaining might have been due to discoloration, and we need not be much 

 astonished that the lateral dorsal spots were overlooked in such a specimen. 



The second specimen of Hoy evidently belonged to an entirely different type. 

 The form and " closely muiicated" belly indicate that it was related to the 

 family of Lepturoids or Trichiuroids, but the "blunt point" in which the 

 tail terminates, as well as the median lateral line, forbid us, on morphological 

 grounds alone, from referring it to Trichiurus lepturus. It might have been 

 supposed to have been a specimen of Lepidopus eaudatus, were it not for the 

 color, but that, sustained by the superior height, forbids us to refer it to that 

 species. What then can it have been? 



In the summer of 1863, I received from the learned Cuban naturalist, Prof. 

 Poey, of the University of Havana, a fish, concerning whose systematic po- 

 sition he was unable to satisfy himself. This fish was found to resemble 

 Lepidopus caudatus in all essential characters except the remarkable form of 

 the head, which was exceedingly compressed, trenchant and obliquely de- 

 curved above, with the forehead elevated above the eyes, and the chin obtuse. 

 Notwithstanding such characters, its affinity to Lepidopus was evideutly so 

 great, the form, structure of the fins, especially the anomalous form of the 

 pectorals, and the development of the opercular bones coinciding, that I 

 felt compelled to retain it in the same subfamily, in contradistinction to one 

 containing Trichiurus (= Lepturus Art.) and Eupleurogr animus. % The color

X This same mistake, indeed, was made in the communication by Dr. Duguid to Dr. Fleming, 

 concerning the same nsh, (see Loudon's Mag. iv., 1831, pp. 215, 216,) and Dr. Fleming, himself, so 

 far from correcting the error, alluded to the similarity of the so-called vent as evidence of the 

 pertinence of Hoy's fish to the same species, (op. cit. iv., 219). By a somewhat singular coincidence, 

 the same error in identification of the Tiachypterus with the Trichiurus lepturus was made by 

 Olafsen (Voyage to Iceland, p. 592.)

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 207 



arrested my attention, there being six or seven narrow bands, the lateral 

 line running through the fourth ; the interval between the two dorsal bands 

 was more indistinct, and the two could readily be confounded ; the width of 

 the two would equal about a sixth of the height, while the width of the sin- 

 gle ones was contained about fifteen or sixteen times in the height. The two 

 lower bands were more indistinct. I was therefore at once reminded of the 

 Trichhirvs lepturus of Hoy, and the similar development of the bars, as 

 well as the approximation in proportions, compel me to believe that the sec- 

 ond specimen of Hoy is in reality a species of the genus Evoxymetopon, if not 

 indeed identical with the Cuban fish itself, (Evoxymctopon txrtiaius Poey.) 

 The greatest height of the latter, at the scapular region, is contained scarcely 

 more than twelve times (12 l-5lh) in the extreme length, while a short dis- 

 tance behind, and for a considerable distance, it is contained from thirteen 

 and a half to fourteen times. The head enters eight times and a half, and 

 the caudal, at its longest rays, twenty-nine times and a half in the same. 

 The anus is midways between the snout and root of caudal. In this last re- 

 spect it disagrees with the specimen signalized by Hoy, according to whom 

 the anus was very considerably within the limits of the first third of the 

 length (46 : 153 + ) Such a position is extremely improbable in a repre- 

 sentative of the sublamily of Lepidopodinae, to^which the specimen doubtless 

 btlongs. The true anus, on account of its small size, was probably over- 

 looked, and a rupture of the skin mistaken for it. May we not hope that 

 some British naturalist will soon release us from our doubts, and verify the 

 systematic position of Hoy's fish? 4 



POLYPROSOPUS Couch. 



Having provisionally adopted the generic name Polyprosopus, proposed by 

 Couch, in the " Analytical Synopsis of the Order of Squali," remarking at the 

 same time that the genus was "not yet well established," it seems advisable 

 now to express my conviction that it belongs to the genus Cetorhinus or Selache, 

 and that the differences observed are probably due to distortion or defective 

 observation. I have already stated that "the absence of caudal carinas or 

 spiracles is quite improbable," and certainly no scientist could believe in the 

 absence of the anal fin in such a type. 



I may finally be permitted to add, in anticipation of a more extended 

 memoir, remarks on the Lemniscates of Richardson, and more especially the 

 Leptocephaius Morrisii Gm. The recent exposition of the character of such 

 fishes, by Professor V. Carus,* will excuse this anticipation. I am happy to 

 be able to express my unqualified belief in the conclusion as to their being 

 simply larval forms, which that learned naturalist has enunciated. As long 

 as the known hyaline fishes conformed to a single type, naturalists might be 

 excused for regarding them as fully developed forms, but the doubt this group 

 was first subjected to by the failure of Kollikerf to find organs of generation 

 was increased by the addition by Kaup of the genus Esunculus,\ and subse- 

 quently of Stomiasunculus.fy Carus was therefore, I think, fully justified in 

 his "conclusion that all these fishes are nothing but larval forms of others," 

 but he was not so happy in looking for the auults " among the Ophidians, or 

 other compressed forms, (Cepola, and so on.)" I am almost certain that 

 the typical Leptocephali, at least, are the young of Congers, and that Leptoceph- 

 aius Morrisii is the young of Conger vulgaris. I am aware, indeed, that Yar- 

 relll| has discovered that small congers, " about the size (length?) of a man's

finger, are found among the rocks, close to land, during the summer." But 

 he immediately afterwards adds that, " the small eels which ascend the 

 Severn in such numbers in the spring, and were considered by Willoughby 

 and Pennant as the young of the Conger, are in reality the young of fresh- 

 water eels." May we not go a step farther and ask that it may be demonstrated 

 that those "found among rocks, close to land," are Congers, and not eels, 

 which have not yet commenced to ascend the rivers ? 



The Hyoproprus Messinensis* appears, likewise, to be merely the larval form 

 of the Congroid Nettastoma melanura.f The resemblance between those two 

 forms will be readily appreciated, by reference to Dr. Kaup's figures of the two. 

 Perhaps the affinities of those Leptocephali with an expanded caudal, are to 

 be sought for elsewhere. As to Esunculus coslai, it resembles the young of a 

 Clupeoid, but the high insertion of the pectoral fins, if existent in nature, forbids 

 for the present its positive identification with such. Stomiasuneulus resembles, 

 in general features, a less advanced larval Clupeoid, about three days old. J in 

 which the ventral fins have not yet appeared. Suspicion, however, may be en- 

 tertained that it may, perhaps, be the young of some other type, (possibly 

 Stomiadoids) on account of the backward position of tbe dorsal fin. I have 

 myself, in company with a friend, seen the young of Clupeoids, which would 

 have either been referred to Esunculus, or considered as the type of a closely 

 allied new one, on account of the inferior insertion of the pectoral fins, and so 

 transparent were they, that their eyes alone indicated their position in the 

 water. Although entertaining no doubts concerning the larval nature of Esuncu- 

 lus a?hd Stomiasuneulus, I only venture to suggest the possible relations with 

 much reserve. As to Porobronchus, Kaup.,$ it is, perhaps, related to Fierasfer, 

 but the character of the first elongated dorsal ray requires to be known, before 

 a decision can be arrived at.

Note on the family of STICH.EOIDS. 

 BY THEODORE GILL. 



There have been referred to the family of Blennioids a number of more or 

 less elongated fishes, somewhat recalling to mind the Gunnelh, but with the 

 body more tapering backwards and covered with scales ; the head compara- 

 tively elongated and produced towards the snout ; the skull depressed be- 

 hind the eyes; the branchial apertures produced forwards ; the dorsal fin 

 composed of spines ; and the stomach caecal, and also distinguished by the 

 development of caeca around the pylorus. This combination of characters 

 seems to indicate the necessity of the separation of the fishes so distinguished 

 from the family of Blennioids, one of the principal characters assigned to 

 which, by authors of even the most recent date, has been the want of caeca. 

 The named genera known are Leptoblennius Gill, Lumpenus Reinh., Leptoclinus 

 Gill, Stichseus Reinh., and Chirolophis Sw. (Carelophus Kr. = Blenniops Nilss.) 

 For this assemblage the name Stichaeoida? may be appropriated. 



Nearly related to this family is that of Cryptacanthoidae, proposed in the 

 " Catalogue of the Fishes of the Eastern Coast." As there is, however, con- 

 siderable difference in the form and development of the head, and the ven- 

 trals are likewise obsolete, it would scarcely be advisable to combine them 

 and the Stichaeoidaj in one family. There are five pyloric appendages in 

 Cryptacanthodes. The genus has none of the peculiar characters of the

Cataphracti, nor has it any resemblance to any genus of that group. It evi- 

 dently is closely related to the Blennioids, and has even been referred to that 

 family by Dr. Gunther, who was unacquainted with its anatomy. 



Also allied to the Stichasoids is the genus Cebedichthys, a herbivorous fish 

 with a very long intestinal canal, and well developed cseca, inhabiting the 

 Pacific waters of the United States. The structure of the dorsal fin, the 

 want of ventral fins, and the form of the head, for the present detain us from 

 referring it to the family. 



Such are, in brief, the characters and relations of the family of Stichaeoids. 

 It is now proposed to submit a corrected list of the species found in the north- 

 eastern American seas, and to give the distinguishing characters by which 

 the various genera may be recognized.

This species, originally founded on a specimen in which a couple of the 

 middle dorsal rays were broken, and the scales rubbed off, was referred to 

 Blennius, from which I subsequently separated it, as it evidently did not be- 

 long to that genus. A specimen obtained by Dr. Stimpson, off the coast of 

 Maine, appears to be identical with Dr. Storer's species, notwithstanding the- 

 disparity in the number of rays. It has enabled me to recognize its true 

 affinities with the Lumpenus gracilis of Reinhardt, near which I had long sus- 

 pected that it belongs. The Maine specimen is colored like the Massachusetts 

 one, and has a caudal like L. gracilis, and only seventy-six dorsal spines, 

 fifty-five anal rays, the first of which is nearly under the twenty-fifth of the

 Storer's specimen is said to have, and is figured with eighty-seven dorsal 

 rays ; there are sixty-six anal and two ventral. I cannot but suspect, how- 

 ever, that on account of the poor condition of the specimen, some misappre- 

 hension may have resulted.

NOETIA, Gray. 



N. ponderosa, Say, occurs abundantly in the Post-Pliocene of the Southern 

 States, and lives on the southern coast of Florida. Specimens have lately 

 been received from Pensacola, and are in the cabinet of the Academy. It is 

 unknown in the Mioeene, the shell I referred to as a variety being a dis- 

 tinct species. 



TURRITELLA, Lam. 



T. prjECincta. Turrited, broad at base ; sides straight, a profoundly ele- 

 vated, thick, angular carina revolves at the summit of each volution, gradu- 

 ally disappearing at the fourth whorl ; carina slightly channelled above, and 

 having a single revolving line beneath near its junction with the whorls, 

 which have each three revolving lines, the inferior one most prominent. 

 Length 3| inches ; width of body whorl, independent of carina, inch. 



Locality. Dallas Co. ? Alabama. Eocene. 



This large species differs from T. Mortoni in having a larger and more ab- 

 ruptly elevated carina, larger and fewer revolving striae, &c. It is allied to 

 T. ro'ifera, Lam. The specimen described was loaned for the purpose by Mr. 

 R. P. Whitfield. Other specimens are in Barnum's Museum, N. Y. 



PROTOCARDIA, Beyrich. 



P. virginiana. Cordate, subtriangular, inequilateral, ventricose, thin ; ra- 

 diating lines minute ; anterior upper margin very oblique, slightly emarginate, 

 posterior side slightly produced, the margin obliquely truncated ; post-um- 

 bonal area densely tuberculated on closely arranged striae ; posterior cardinal 

 tooth small, tubercular. Height Ik inch ; length 1 2-5ths inch. 



Locality. Pamunkey River, Virginia. Mr. Ruffin. 



This species is smaller and proportionally longer than P. Nicolleti, with a 

 smaller umbo, &c. This is the third Eocene species of Protocardia found in 

 the United States. There are two species in the American Cretaceous rocks. 

 The genus did not survive the Eocene fauna. 



Ecphora 4-costata, Say. 

 Lister's figure 1059, fig. 2, represents a rare variety of this species, without 

 umbilicus. I found one such specimen. Dillwyn erroneously refers Lister's 

 figure to a variety of Buccinum scala. The shell is very peculiar in substance, 

 resembling horn. The umbilicus, though generally enormously large, is 

 sometimes moderate. The range of this species is from New Jersey to South 

 Carolina, inclusive. 



FASCIOLARIA, Lam. 

 F. subtenta. Fusiform ; volutions 7 ; body whorl ventricose, penultimate 

 subangulated, the others angular below the middle, tuberculato-costate ; 

 surface rugoso-striate ; lines alternate on the spire, irregular on the body 

 whorl, many of them thick and prominent ; minute, rugose, longitudinal lines 

 ornament the whorls; outer lip ribbed within, the ribs divided towards the

L. curvirostra. Subfusiform ; volutions 6; spire prominent; ribs rounded,

 the flat upper surface ; about 21 on the body whorl with a fine intermediate 

 line ; surface of the shell finely wrinkled longitudinally ; aperture patulous ; 

 base of columella rounded ; fold obsolete ; beak long and twisted. 



Locality. North Carolina ? 



A larger species than Lj. snlcosa, and differing in having a longer and

E. ovalis, Conrad. Having obtained several specimens of this Miocene 

 fossil since the description was first published, I find, on comparison with 

 the English shell sent me by S. V. Wood, that it is a distinct species from the 

 latter. 



Mr. Stimpson also made the comparison in my presence, and came to the 

 same conclusion. The error, therefore, in the Monograph of the Crag Mol- 

 lusca is mine. 



CTPRINIDM. 



CYPRIMERIA. 



Lentiform ; hinge of right valve broad, with a bifid oblique cardinal tooth 

 under the apex, and two oblique acute anterior teeth, with an intermediate 

 pit for the reception of the tooth in the opposite valve. 



Cytherea excavata, Morton. 



Only one valve has been obtained showing the hinge, and the exterior 

 markings, which consist of very fine concentric lines on the umbo and wrin- 

 kled lines of growth on the other parts. There is no cartilage pit. Behind 

 the bifid tooth is a slightly raised plate rugoso-striate. The muscular im- 

 pression unknown. Found at Arneytown, N. J., in Cretaceous marl. 



Cyprimeria excavata.

DOSINIOPSIS. 



Equivalve, lentiform ; hinge with three cardinal teeth in each valve ; pos- 

 terior tooth of right valve bifid ; in the left valve a thick rugose lateral tooth 

 fitting into a cavity in the opposite valve ; under the apex is a pit or cavity ; 

 cartilage plate granulated ; pallial sinus deep and angular. 



Exteriorly the shells of this genus resemble Dosinia ; and the pit under the 

 apex and the form of the pallial impression are similar, but the anterior, 

 thick, rugose cardinal tooth, the posterior hinge channel and tooth-like plate, 

 and the muscular impressions ally it most nearly to Vtnilia and Cyprina. 



Venus lineolatus, Sowerby, has a hinge character nearly allied to, if not 

 identical with, this genus. 



D. meekii. Short ovate, ventricose, moderately thick, inequilateral ; ante- 

 rior margin regularly rounded ; posterior dorsal margin elongated, rounded, 

 very oblique, the extremity subangulated ; apex prominent ; basal margin 

 profoundly curved ; lunule obsolete, or defined by an obscure line ; surface 

 without other lines than those of growth. Height 1|- inch ; length If inch. 



Locality. Six miles east of Washington, D. C. Meek. 



Proportionally more elevated and convex than D. (Cytherea) lenticular is, 

 Rogers. 



A singular feature of this shell is a tuberculated callus under the anterior 

 cardinal plate, which occurring in 4 valves must be characteristic of the spe- 

 cies. It has the appearance of having grown up from the inner surface of the 

 valve and folded over the under side of the hinge plate. 



Mr. Meek found this species abundantly in a dark grey quartzose sand, six 

 miles east of Washington, D. C, in company with other new univalves and 

 bivalves. Cytherea lenticularis , Rogers, belongs to the genus Dosiniopsis, and 

 more closely resembles Dosinia exteriorly. Both characterize the oldest 

 portion of the American Eocene which has yet been observed. 



This genus, like the preceding, is remarkable for uniting the characters of 

 two families, Cyprinidie and Veneridse, which are obviously distinct in the re- 

 cent shells.

Synopsis of the PLETJRONECTOIDS of the Eastern Coast of North America, 



BY THEODORE GILL. 



In the present brief article, an analytical synopsis distinguishing the genera 

 of east coast Pleuronectoids, already named, is submitted, and the different 

 names under which the species have been described are referred to the syno- 

 nymy of the species to which they are supposed to belong ; and, in one case, 

 {Reinhardtius hippo glossoides) where the decision of the synonymy would in- 

 volve the nomenclature and geographical distribution of two widely distinct 

 forms, the synonymy has been quite fully discussed. If the premises taken 

 are correct, the genera herewith enumerated are the only known forms as yet 

 entitled to a place in the Fauna of the East Coast. If, on the other hand, 

 that view against which I have contended is the true one, the genus Glyp- 

 tocephalus, an ally of Pleuronectes, must be added, and the name Reinhardtius 

 hippo glossoides replaced by another.

We owe to Cuvier the first natural subdivision of the genus Pleuronectes, 

 as restricted by Quensel. That great philosopher distributed the representa- 

 tives of the genus thus limited, which is equivalent to a family in the modern 

 acceptation of the word, among three subgenera : Platessa, in which the 

 teeth of the jaws are uniserial, trenchant and obtuse, and those of the 

 pharyngeal" bones blunt ; Hippoglossus, in which all the teeth are strong 

 and acute, and Rhombus, similar to the latter, but with the dorsal advanced 

 towards the edge of the upper jaw. The species respectively referred to 

 these several groups are evidently closely related, and all possess characters 

 coincident with those assigned by Cuvier, and apparently of greater value. 



The Platessce have a small oblique mouth in front of the eyes ; the Hippo- 

 fjlossi, a large one extending below the eye ; and in the Rhombi, the ventral 

 fins are very broad at their bases, the rays distant, and the fin of the colored 

 side on the ridge of the abdomen. These groups correspond to the subfamilies 

 Pleuronectina?, Hippoglossinae and Rhombinfe as now limited, and thus have 

 different elements from the subfamilies of Bonaparte. The natural character 

 of these groups was first destroyed by the reference to the Platessae of the 

 Plmrcweetes limandoides of Bloch. This fish was referred by Cuvier to the 

 genus Hippoglossus, but was subsequently transferred by all naturalists to the 

 genus Platessa, with which it neither agrees in technical characters nor in 

 natural ones. Subsequent modifications of the subgenera of Cuvier rendered 

 them still less natural, and the American species, especially, were grouped 

 little in accordance with their affinities. In the following synopsis of the Pit -- 

 ronectoids of Eastern North America, I have distributed the species in accord- 

 ance with the Cuvierian ideas.

In a small collection of desired fishes, which I owe to the kindness of my 

 friend, Mr. F. W. Putnam, of Salem, Mass., were two specimens of this nn- 

 described representative of the Pleuronectinae. The new species is generic- 

 ally distinct from any representative of the family hitherto found, not only of 

 the eastern American seas, but from any yet known, although it shares some 

 characters with a Russian fish, the Platessa dwinensis of Liljeborg,* (Pleuro-

 considered as a mere synonyme of the latter.

Mitchill well describes the coloration. " The uniformity of color is inter- 

 rupted by four dark spots on the back, two on each side of the lateral line. 

 One of the two on each side is about midway of the length, and the other near 

 the tail. The former are about three-quarters of an inch in diameter [in a spe- 

 cimen 15 X 6] ; the latter not so considerable." This description, therefore, 

 cannot be referrible to a variety of the common species. 



The radial formula of Mitchill, (D. 79. A. 59), is not applicable to this 

 Choznopsetta, nor C. ocellaris, and is probably either the result of a typo- 

 graphical error, or carelessness in enumeration. The Choznopsetta dentata 

 exhibits no trace of spots.

 Hippoglossus groenlandieus Gthr., Cat. iv. 404. 



This species had by common consent been identified with the Pleuronectes 

 cynoglossus of the Fauna Groenlandica afterwards named by Walbaum P. 

 hippoglossoides and by Fabricius P. pinguis until the year 1862. In that year, 

 Dr. Giinther* contended that the ' ' Pleuronectes cynoglossus, Fabr. Faun. Groenl. 

 p. 163, or PL pinguis, Fabr. Vidensk, Selsks. Naturv. Math. Afhandl. i. 

 p. 43, tab. 2, f. 1, is probably identical with PL cynoglossus Gronov. and Linn., 

 as the only difference of any importance appears to be that the Greenland fish 

 is said to have 72 74 rays in the anal fin. It is evident, however, from a 

 single glance at the figure, that it is generically different from Hippoglossvcs," 



The following characters are the most distinctive respectively assigned to 

 the Pleuronectes cynoglossus by Fabricius, and the species of the same name 

 by Giinther. It is necessary, however, to first premise that the true Hippo- 

 glossus vulgaris, as acknowledged by Reinhardt, &c, is first described, after 

 which follows the description of "P. cynoglossus," Fab., which is said to be 

 allied to the P. Hippoglossus, but to be smaller and more oblong.

As negative evidence, the absence, so far as known, of the true Pleuronectes 

 or Glyptocephalus cynoglossus in the Greenland seas, whose Ichthyology is so 

 well known, is one of the strongest, especially as Fabricius states that his 

 species is comparatively abundant and readily caught. 



Equally explicit also is the description of the same species by Fabricius un- 

 der the new name of Pleuronectes pinguis, in the Transactions of the Royal 

 Danish Academy. J 



That description is indeed the amplification of the one in the "Fauna 

 Groenlandica." The fins are described, the caudal as emarginated, the rays

 known in essentially the same terms. Furthermore, the scales are said to be 

 very small, and imbedded in the skin, which appears smooth and slimy to 

 the touch;* one of the eyes is nearly on the crown of the kead,f and the 

 branchial arches have large and robust rakers, each with eight pectinations, 

 themselves divided at the tip.f 



As to the figure, it cannot assist identification, being a worthless caricature, 

 and, like that of the Hippoglossoides platessoides, representing a small mouth. 

 It might equally well serve as the representation of any Pleuronectoid, and is 

 as unlike the Glyptocephalus cynoglossus as any other species. 



From these remarks, it will be evident that I feel compelled to agree with 

 the several excellent naturalists who have identified the Fabrician fish with 

 a Pleuronectoid closely related to Hippoglossus, since every character which 

 distinguishes it from Glyptocephalus cynoglossus is shared with the species 

 under consideration.

 with doubt, as identical with Reinhardtius hippoglossoides. The figure given 

 by Dekay represents the form and fins of a Hippoglossus, and the lateral line 

 is expressly said to be "arched over the pectorals." The species is, there- 

 fore, a typical Hippoglossus.

 slender teeth behind directed outwards; on the light side smooth or uniciliate. 



Lateral line straight, simple, continuous through a series of short tubes, 

 channelled along their posterior half. 



Head moderate, rhombic, depressed above the eye, with the snout nearly 

 rectilinear and the rostral area rhombic ; covered with minute scattered scales 

 extending along the interorbital area, and with an osseous ridge below the up- 

 per eye, and continued from its hinder angle backwards, where it is expanded, 

 and separated from an oblique bony tubercule on the scapula. Eyes moderate, 

 approximated, even, chiefly in the anterior third of the head. Nostrils of the 

 dark side even longitudinally, the anterior next to the border of the snout; 

 the posterior between orbits in front; of the left side, on the left side of the 

 ridge, approximated ; the hinder close in front of the dorsal fin at its inner 

 angle; anterior nostrils tabular and nearly blind, minutely perforated near the 

 end ; posterior transversely fissured, with lips. Opercula well developed. 



Mouth moderately small, with the cleft oblique (c. 45) in front of eye; the 

 jaws of the respective sides nearly equal ; the lower scarcely prominent, and 

 with a very obtuse, rounded chin. 



Lips moderate and simple; the latter attached by a froenum at the left side 

 of the symphisis. 



Tongue slender, but well developed and free. 



Teeth uniserial, in an imperfect row on the dark side, moderate, moveable, 

 reclining inwards, compressed, capitate or constricted near the apex, and with the 

 apex itself blunt and emarginate, especially towards the symphisis ; palate 

 smooth. 



Branchial apertures free below, closed above the operculum. 



Branchiostcgal rays seven, exceptionally six. 



Dorsal '.fin with its rays simple, in moderate number ; its origin above the 

 upper eye, rapidly increasing, and with its rays converging towards the poste- 

 rior third. 



Anal fin with its middle rays highest, but directed obliquely forwards, and 

 with no true spine in front. 



Caudal convex behind. 



Pectoral fins moderate, obliquely rounded behind. 



Ventral subbrachial, normally developed. 



The interior pharyngeal bones are united, oblong, triangular, with the sides 

 rectilinear ; the posterior margin broadly emarginate, (without sinus at the 

 junction) bent upwards and trenchant ; behind and beneath sloping forwards, 

 and with a wide trihedral enlargement expanded downwards below at the mid- 

 dle. The teeth are blunt, paved, and on all the upper surface, except the de- 

 flected posterior marginal area. The lower pharyngeals are oblique, the mid- 

 dle largest; the first and second with two rows of molar teeth ; the third with 

 one. 



The branchial arches are provided on their external surfaces with soft, com- 

 pressed, unarmed, subunguiform rakers, decreasing from the first to the 

 fourth, oblong on the first, very short on the fourth, which alone has rudimen- 

 tary rakers on the internal surface.

newly-discovered type among the genera of Pleuronectoids. From the Ame- 

 rican genera Pseudopleuronecles, Blkr., Liopsetta, Gill, Myzopsetta, Gill, and Li- 

 manda, Gottsche, it is at least distinguished by its squamation, oculo-scapular 

 ridge, nostrils, dentition and structure of the dorsal and anal fins. It is most 

 nearly related to Pleuronectes* with which it agrees in the free tongue, but 

 the more perfect union and the triangular form of the wholly united lower 

 pharyngeal bones, the want of an anal spine, and above all the moveable teeth 

 and scarcely perforate anterior nasal tubes will especially distinguish it, not 

 only from that genus, but from any other known one. So anomalous indeed are 

 the characters of dentition and nostrils, that only after I had felt each tooth 

 could I be convinced that they were really normally moveable, and that the 

 condition was not the effect of disease, an idea which, improbable as it was, 

 occurred to me. The remaining genera of the subfamily of Pleuronectinae Pla- 

 tichthys, Grd., Parophrys, Grd., Lepidopsctta, Gill, Glyplocephalus, Gottsche, Mi- 

 crostomus, Gottsche, f Pleuronichthys, Grd., Bypsopsetta, Gill, Heteroprosopon,

 ready mentioned.!

The height of the body enters between 24 and 2f times in the ex'reoae 

 length. The head enters about 4i 4.} times in the same, and is not much 

 longer than the caudal fin. There are about 19 20 teeth in the upper jaw, on 

 the white side, and 9 or 10 on the dark ; in the lower 11 to 13 on the white, and 

 about 5 on the dark side. The height of the dorsal fin, at its highest portion, 

 which is at or near the thirty-second ray, is little less than a seventh of the 

 total length ; the longest anal rays, from the thirteenth to fifteenth, equal or 

 excel those of the dorsal. The pectoral fin enters about 6^ 6.J timesin the 

 length, and attains to the vertical from the twenty-third to twenty-3eventh 

 dorsal ray and eighth or ninth anal one. The ventral fin is inserted with its 

 axil at the vertical of the upper axil of the pectoral, and reaches to the second 

 or third ray of the anal; its length enters 9 J 9f times in the total.

f Microstomus, Gottsciie, lS35=Cynicoglossus, Bon, Fauna Italica Fasc, xix, 1S37, (sub Plat. 

 passer)=Cynoglossa, Bon, 1846, &c. Microstomus is perhaps sufficiently distinct from Microstoma ; 

 if not, can Cynicoglosms be used? Bonaparte, in his enumeration of the subgenera of Pleuro- 

 nectes, after the definition of Platessa, gave that of Cynicoglossus. " Secondo e Cynicoglossus nob. 

 che come it PI. cynoglossus L. ha la linea laterale retta, la bocca piccola, li denti come quello di 

 sopra \Ptatessd\ ma la mascelle uguali, con labbra turgide, e Vano senza sjiina." Bonaparte has 

 simply followed Nilsson in the erroneous identification of Pleuronectes microccphalus with PI. cy- 

 noglossus, L. As the definition of his genus does not, however, apply to the latter and does to the 

 former, it may perhaps be connected with it, notwithstanding the specific mention of the type. 



I am aware that an anal spine has been recently denied to Glyptocephalus cynoglossus, but it is 

 quite distinct in the specimen seen by me, and its presence has been admitted by other natural- 

 ists. On the other hand, a prominent spine has been attributed in one place to Microstomus, and 

 denied in another ; the latter view is sustained by naturalists generally. I am also aware that 

 the lateral line has been said to be strongly curved, but a very slight curvature only seems to be 

 evident in nature. 



t Dr. GUnther has referred to the group of narrow-mouthed Pleuronectoids with "the upper 

 eye not in advance ot the lower," four very well marked generic types Psammodiscus, Ammotrelis, 

 Jihombosolea, and Peltoramplius which evidently have no affinity with Euchalorodus. Their sys- 

 tematic position even is for me doubtful, and some of them at least especially Peltorhamphm 

 appear to belong to the family of Soleoidae. As however the form , the distinction or not exter- 

 nally of the opercular bones, the structure of the m >uth, the development of the branchial aper- 

 tures, &c, have not been made known with sufficient precision, no definite opinion can be formed.

were caught, with others, by C. A. Putnam, Esq., in the harbor of Salem, in 

 the month of January, 1858. To the able ichthyologist to whom we are in- 

 debted for our knowledge of the species, we dedicate it in token of friendly 

 and scientific appreciation. 



The next species appears to belong to a genus already established by Dr. P. 

 Von Bleeker, but differs very decidedly from the known species. 



CITHARICHTHYS Blkr., Gthr. 



ClTHARICHTHYS MICROSTOMUS, Gill. 



The height of the body enters about 2f times (-36 -37) in the extreme 

 length ; that of the caudal peduncle about eleven times. The head forms a 

 fifth of the length, is rather abbreviated, scarcely sinuous above the eyes, blunt 

 at the snout, which scarcely exceeds a seventh of the head's length, and the 

 rostral area is rhombic, and not higher than long. The eyes are even ; the 

 longitudinal diameter contained about 33 times (.05^ in the head's length. 

 The mouth is rather small, the length of the upper jaw only equalling a quar- 

 ter of the length, and that of the lower two-fiftbs of the head's length. The 

 teeth are very small, and close together ; larger in front. The dorsal com- 

 mences above the front of the orbit, and is highest, and convergent near the 

 fortieth ray, which equals about the tenth of the total length ; the anal is 

 highest at about the twenty-fifth ray, and is high or even higher than the dor- 

 sal. The caudal is rounded behind, and forms about a sixth of the length. 

 The pectoral fins are unequally developed, that of the dark side being pro- 

 longed, and contained only 6| times in the total length, while that of the white 

 side only equals a tenth of the same; the rays are all simple. The ventral fins 

 are also unequally developed, the right being on the abdominal ridge at its 

 origin, rather in advance of the opercular margin, and with its longest rays 

 contained about fourteen times in the total length ; stretched backwards, it ex- 

 tends to the second anal ray ; the fin on the white side is more advanced, 

 wider, and its rays longer, contained less than twelve times in the length, and 

 extends backward to nearly the third anal ray.

The scales are large, angular behind, covered with smaller ones, especially 

 near the point of junction of contiguous ones, where alone they are developed 

 on the blind side; the scales of the eyed side are mostly minutely ciliated be- 

 hind, unarmed however near the lateral line, the scales of which last are quad- 

 rate and mostly covered ; the scales of the blind side are less angular behind 

 and unarmed. The lateral line runs through about forty-two scales, while of 

 longitudinal rows there are ten above and fourteen below the lateral line. 



The color is uniform reddish brown. 



A single specimen, little more than three inches long, was first obtained by 

 Prof. Baird at Beesley's Point. It is especially distinguished from its California 

 relative, 0. sordida, by the short snout, small mouth and large scales ; 0. sor- 

 dida having about fifty-eight scales pierced by the lateral line, and eighteen 

 rows above the lateral line. Notwithstanding this great disparity in the size 

 of the scales and mouth, C. microstomus appears to agree in most respects with 

 the Californian fish, as well as generically with Citharichthys spilopterus of Giin- 

 ther, aspecies inhabiting the Gulf of Mexico. As the name Citharichthys was 

 introduced a short time before that of Orthopsetta, proposed for the Psettichthys 

 sordidus, and was framed for a species related to that type, that name must be 

 adopted if the 0. sordida is not regarded as generically distinct. 



I may here remark that, although I have referred the Platessa quadrocularis of 

 Storer to the genus Chxnopsetta, (C. oblonga), it is possible that it may not 

 truly belong to that genus, as the dorsal and anal fins are represented as in-

creating backwards till Dear their ends, and the anterior dorsal rays are free 

 at their ends ; but as the species agrees so closely in other external characters, 

 I feel compelled to retain it in that genus for the present at least. 



In this connection, I may also mention a species found at Pensacola, which 

 exhibits several characters in common with the species referred to, but repre- 

 sents a distinct genus closely related to Chcenopsetta, Paralichthys and Pseudo- 

 rhombus ; the naso-dorsal side of the rhombic outline is very convex ; the supra- 

 ocular region depressed ; the interorbial area formed by a narrow, scaleless 

 ridge; the caudal peduncle short; the scales ctenoid, and the dorsal and anal 

 fins respectively highest, and convergent far behind and at nearly the same 

 vertical. The species has a height of little less less than half the extreme 

 length ; the head almost a fourth, and the caudal almost a fifth. The first fin 

 rays are the longest and filiform, progressively increasing, and the fin itself 

 commences at a vertical between the orbit and pupil. The rays of the dorsal 

 (70) converge towards the fiftieth ; those of the anal (56) towards the thirtieth. 



The color is reddish brown, with four ocellated spots larger than the eye ; 

 the first above the longer declining portion of the falciform arch of the lateral 

 line ; the three posterior forming the angles of a triangle ; the anterior two mid- 

 way between the snout and caudal margin, and the posterior on the lateral 

 line. It may be named Ancylopsetta quadrocellatus. 



On the Characters of the higher Groups of KEPTILIA SQUAMATA-and 

 especially of the DIPL0GL0SSA. 



BY E. D. COPE. 



Since it is only by an attentive consideration of the peculiarities of organ- 

 ized beings that their relationships in time present and past can be deter- 

 mined, the more complete that examination the more certain will our conclu- 

 sions be. In the course of preparation of systematic work, the great need of 

 well established bases is often felt, and nowhere more urgently than among 

 the Reptiles. The following abstract, presenting some new views in this de- 

 partment, have been taken from my MSS., as exhibiting some of the stronger 

 points among the multitudinous variations of the reptilian skeleton. 



Prof. Johannes Muller* has given us the best characters for distinguishing 

 the Ophidia and Lacertilia, viz. : The former having the ali- and orbito-sphe- 

 noid regions osseous the latter membranous ; there being one suspensorium 

 for the quadrature in the first, two in the second. It is true he says Acontias 

 forms an exception, having but one suspensorium, but I have seen the second 

 in a specimen prepared by Herr Will, of Munich, and Prof. Peters showed it 

 to me in a Berlin specimen. Anelytrops, a genus nearly allied to Typhlo- 

 saurus, possesses both, well developed. Aniella, however, appears to consti- 

 tute a real exception to the rule, having but one suspensorium, thus resem- 

 bling the Ophiosaurii or Auiphisbaenia : it resembles the latter so in its elon- 

 gate temporal, continuous with the parietal, the downward prolongation of 

 the latter bone and its close union with the occipital sclerotome, as to connect 

 them closely with the Lacertilia. The true hiatus in the series of Squamata 

 is, in my opinion, to be found between the Ophiosauri and Tortricina. The 

 characters of the skeleton remaining up to the present time, by which Lacer- 

 tilia and Ophidia may be distinguished, are as follows : 



Lacertilia. Ophidia. 



Continuity of the parietal and sphenoid Continuity of parietal and sphenoid 



walls interrupted. walls complete. 



Rami of the mandible united by suture. Rami united by ligament. 



From the centre of multiplicity of forms of typical Lacertilia, we can pursue

three series one toward the serpents by Amphisbfenia, one to the partially 

 degraded type of the Geccos, and lastly through the highest or acrodont se- 

 ries, to Chamaeleo on the one hand and Hatteria on the other. 



In the first case the prolonged development of the superior temporal is fol- 

 lowed by a decurving of the parietal border, the closer attachment of the occi- 

 pital sclerotome, and shortening of the squamosal and mastoid. Finally, the 

 temporal, with the pieces adjoining anteriorly, begin to restrict a foramen 

 ovale, the orbito-sphenoid is developed, and the articular and angular pieces 

 of the mandible are represented by but one piece : the columella disappears. 

 In the last direction, the temporal is not elongate, nor is there any tendency 

 toward a more complete closure of the cranial cavity. The inferior or ? pet- 

 rous wing of the temporal is directed inwards instead of forwards ; the parietal 

 fontanelle does not diminish, and the premaxillaryboneis seen to form a regu- 

 larly decreasing series. The mesosternum and columella diminish in length 

 and disappear, and the splenial appears smaller and smaller to extinction. 

 The subarticular strengthens the inner rather than the outer wall of the man- 

 dible, and the external direction of the coronoid is reversed. The type of 

 Hatteria doubles the premaxillary, and exhibits the vertebrae amphicoelian. 



In approaching the Geccos, the bones of the palate are seen to be thinner 

 and more expanded, and the articular piece of the mandible is lost. In the 

 full type the ossification is of the lightest description, and the fascial and 

 basement membranes often present incomplete deposits of bony tissue ; thus 

 the parietal and sternal fontanelles disappear. The parietals are not, as 

 usual, united, and there is a dimunition (in Uroplates nearly obliteration), 

 of the median or basilar segment of the occipital condyle. There is a temporal 

 ala peculiar to this suborder. 



The following is a synopsis of the prevailing characters of the suborders : * 



ACRODONTA. 



Shanks of teeth compressed, most always between two alveolar walls. 



Coronoid bone produced posteriorly, on outside of ramus. 



Articular present separate from angular. Splenial reduced, more frequently 



wanting. 

 Subarticular small on outer, much prolonged on inner face of ramus.

Aniellidae. 

 Of the families here proposed or adopted, the Anolidse deserves first men- 

 tion. Its peculiarities are want of articular bone ; absence of xiphisternal 

 fontanelle ; presence of abdominal ribs ; in these points agreeing with the 

 Nyctisaura or Gecconidae, and differing from the mass of the Iguanidae. Still, 

 among the latter Polychrus forms a close connection, wanting the xiphisternal 

 fontanelle, and having the abdominal ribs. 



A n g u i d se. This family I have constructed from fragments of the old Zonu- 

 ridae and Scincidae ; agreeing with Peters in referring the Old World repre- 

 sentatives of the former to tbe Lacertidse, and those of the New to the neigh- 

 borhood of Heloderma. From the Scincidae I have taken the New World 

 Diploglossinae, finding them possessed of the same peculiar characters which 

 associate the Pseudopus with Gerrhonotus and Heloderma. The families rep- 

 resented by these types differ as follows. None of them have the dilated 

 maxillary laminae of the Scincidae : 

 A foramen (often large) from nasal meatus to palate on 



each side of premaxillary. Internasal plate large, 



transverse. Two or more pairs of supranasals.* 



Head shielded behind. Mesosternum cruciform... Anguidae. 

 No premaxillary foramen. Two or more pairs of supra- 



nasals. Internasal plate small or wanting. Head 



scaled behind. Mesosternum cruciform Gerrhonotidae. 



No premaxillary foramen. Head tubercularly scaled. 



Mesosternum simple Helod e r m i dae. 



There are four sub-groups among the genera of Anguidae, viz. : Opheosau- 

 rinae, with the anterior limb of the mesosternum very short or wanting ; the 

 dorsal scales in cross rows and a lateral fold ; genera Dopasia, Pseudopus, 

 Opheosaurus and Opheodes : Opheomorinae without side fold, and with trans- 

 verse dorsal rows, Opheomorus : Anguinae with shortened mesosternum, 

 quincuncial dorsal scales and no lateral fold Anguis : Diploglossinae without 

 lateral fold, with elongate anterior limb of mesosternum and quincuncial 

 dorsal scales, containing Onida, Panolopus, Sauresia, (== Emhryopus Weinl.) 

 Diploglossus, Microlepis and Camilia : (in C. monotropis Pet. I have ob- 

 served an apparent exception to the rule of the retractility of the end of the 

 tongue in this tribe. )+ 



Of the Gerrhonotidae I know but the two genera, Barissia and Gerrhonotus. 

 Xenosaurus Pet. resembles the succeeding family rather than this ; I have not 

 had the opportunity of seeing its sternum. 

 Among the Leptoglossae with a simple premaxillary, the Teidae only have

not the temporal fossae roofed over by ossified, or much thickened dermal 

 plates. The families may be thus compared : 



a.. Premaxillary single. 



Temporal fossae not roofed ; tongue squamous papillose 



in oblique series, or squamous. Nostril in plate 



or suture : always a xiphisternal fontanelle Teidae. 



Temporal fossae roofed ; tongue wholly or partially with 



oblique plicae projecting forwards and inwards ; 



nostril on intersquamal suture Lacertidae. 



Temporal fossae roofed ; tongue squamous ; nostril in 



single plate Ecpleopidae. 



/?. Premaxillary double. 



Temporal fossa roofed. Tongue squamous. Nostril in 



a single plate; palatine maxillary laminae dilated ; 



rarely a xiphisternal fontanelle Scincidae . 



Temporal fossa roofed ; tongue squamous. Nostril in 



notch of rostral ; palatine maxillary laminae often 



dilated Sepsidae. 



I do not know the complete characters of the Chalcidae, but they are very 

 near the Lacertidae. The American Lepidophyma, Xantusia and Cricosaura 

 enter the Lacertidae, as here defined, as I have failed to find characters which 

 separate them from this Old World family. The affinity to Zonurus, pointed 

 out by Dumeril, is manifested in the double parietals of the first two. Mancus 

 and Gerrhosaurus enter the same family in all points though the tongue is 

 partially scaly but in Zonurus there are two important exceptions in which 

 it approaches Gerrhonotus, viz : the tongue is papillose, and the posterior 

 limb bounding the clavicular foramen is wanting. Tretioscincus* enters the 

 Ecpleopidae, but presents the peculiarity of a simple clavicle. In a species of 

 Brachypus I find the clavicle not always perforate, and in Trachysaurus the 

 foramen is also wanting, although the dilatation is extensive. All these 

 families, except the first, are known to possess serpentiform types ; such 

 are among the true Seines, Siaphus, Hemiergis, Campsodactylus, etc. 

 The last is a degraded form of Mabuia : in the second the articular and 

 subarticular bones appear to be united : the first is, in all respects, typical of 

 the family in its proper characters, as illustrated by the species at hand, 



S. simplexf mihi. 

 Pygopus and Lialis, with simple premaxillary, enter this tribe and are 

 perhaps types of separate families. Whether Aprasia belongs in this or the 

 next is as yet a question; it has some points of resemblance to Amelia.}

fS. simplex. Nasals as high as broad, not meeting above rostral : internasal much broader than 

 long, in contact with prufrenal. Frontonasals longest transversely, with an acute inner angle, not 

 touching in front of frontal. Latter elongate cuneiform, three-sided in front. Supraorbitals 

 four, posterior small; frontoparietals large, extensively in contact, occipitals large, long, nearly 

 entirely separated by the interoccipital (which is long as the frontal) and bounded exteriorly by a 

 long exoccipital. 5 superior labials. Transverse symphyscal and mental: 1st pair infralabials in 

 contact, and two following pairs very elongate transversely. Twenty rows scales round the middle 

 of the body, dorsal larger; four rows broader on nape. Three toes on anterior, none on posterior

 pranasals, nares between the anterior and first superior labial; one transverse frontonasal. Ros- 

 tral oval, prominent. All the scales imbricated, with two keels and a groove between; no larger 

 abdominal series. P. gracilis is Pygopus gracilis, Schlegel, (Mus. Leyden) to whom I am in- 

 debted for the opportunity of making this description. Occipitals broad, acuminate, as long as 

 frontal and frontonasal. Three supraorbitals, posterior largest, Temporal scales large, keeled.

The families of the last tribe differ as follows : 



a. Two suspensoria; nostril in the rostral shield. Tongue squamous. 

 Eye concealed by epidermis ; occipital segment loosely 



attached. No frontal under-arch An ely tr opidje .* 



Eye distinct ; occipital closely articulated ; two premax- 



illaries Acontiida?. 



B. One suspensorim ; nostril in a nasolabial plate ; tongue papillose. 

 Eye distinct; occipital closely articulated; one premax- 



illary ; an inferior frontal arch Anielli d se. 



In the first family enter Typhlosaurus, Feylinia, (much the same is Typhlo- 

 scincus) and Anelytrops. In these the columella is well developed. In Ane- 

 lytrops there is a long squamosal articulated to the side of the parietal, as in 

 Rhineiira and Cephalopeltis, the premaxillary is single, and palatine lamina? 

 of the maxillary are dilated. The spleniomental groove is open. There are 

 two slender clavicles united medially and giving insertion to the thoracic 

 hsemapoyhyses. These, according to Rathke, are present, but not in contact 

 in Acontias, and Peters and Stannius failed to find them in Typhlosaurus. 

 The pelvis I find to be represented by an oblique bone at the extremities of two 

 pairs of ribs on each side of the vent. 



The remarkable genus Amelia lacks the squamosal and columella, and has 

 a single premaxillary. The parietal is continuous with the superior plate of 

 the temporal, and is much decurved toward the sphenoid ; the frontal en- 

 closes the olfactory lobes below ; these characters are the most amphisbfenian 

 in the order. There are small pre- and postfrontal bones, and a slender ligamen- 

 tous postorbital arch. I have as yet found no sternal pieces, and the splenio- 

 mental groove is closed, as in Acontias. 



The Ophidian suborders may be briefly summed up as follows : 



*. Mastoid part of cranial walls : coronoid bone present. 



I. No ectopterygoid. No prefontal. Maxillary without 



alveolar ridges or malar process. Rudiments of 



pelvis without pubis Scolecophidia.

alveolar ridge and malar process. Rudiments of 



pelvis with pubis Catodonta.|

alveolar ridges and teeth, horizontal, in contact 



with prefrontal Toetkicina.

On a Blind SILTIRID, from Pennsylvania. 



BY E. D. COPE. 



Animals deprived of the sense of sight are generally known inhabitants of 

 subterranean areas of earth or water, although representing by their general 

 structure, zoological groups most diverse. Among fish, two blind species of 

 the Cod family are found in the caves of Cuba. The blind fish of the Mam- 

 moth Cave, with its sightless relative, the Typhlichthys, belong to a family 

 represented by an eyed genus in the ditches of Carolina. Among the Catfish 

 or Siluridae there are sundry genera of a variety of form, in which the eyes 

 are wanting or concealed by the skin. These are mostly South American or 

 East Indian species, those of the latter country, of the Akysis type, approach 

 nearest to our eyed Catfish of North America, according to the system of 

 Bleeker. For a knowledge of the first genus of blind Silurid from our country, 

 I am indebted to my friend Jacob Stauffer, Secretary of the Linnsean Society 

 of Lancaster, an ardent explorer of the Zoology and Botany of Southern Penn- 

 sylvania, and who has furnished me with many valuable notes and specimens. 

 This fish, of which specimens have been taken in the Conestoga creek, a tribu- 

 tary of the Susquehannah, is simply a blind representative of the ordinary type 

 of Silurids, characteristic of North America, and is not to be arranged with the 

 exotic groups. It, therefore, enters the group Ictnluri, of Gill, with our genera 

 Ameiirus, Hopladelus, Noturus and Ictalwrus, possessing especially the charac- 

 ters of the first. The genus may be called Gronins, and be explained by the 

 following diagnosis : Head broad, depressed. Supraoccipital bone posteriorly 

 free. Branchiostegal membrane with ten rays. Anterior dorsal spine stout, 

 posterior fin separated from caudal. Ventrals with eight rays. Eyes rudi- 

 mental, covered by the corium. Natatory bladder present. 



The species has the head broader posteriorly, and the anal fin shorter than 

 in the allied species of Ameiirus. It may be called G. n igr i 1 a b ris. The 

 muzzle is flat and the jaws equal ; the width across the occipital region is 

 equal to the length from the end of the muzzle to the apex of the occipital 

 crest ; width below equal from the axilla of the pectoral to the base of the 

 ventral fin. From end of muzzle to dorsal spine equal from latter to middle 

 of adipose. Length of head four and one-fifth times in total length. Max-

illary batbels extend three-fourths the distance to the opercular border ; outer 

 (longer) mentals scarcely beyond middle branchiostegal angle. Height of body 

 at base of dorsal equal three-fourths length of head. End of pectoral oppo- 

 site posterior border of first dorsal, its spinous ray serrate ; ventrals not 

 reaching anal. Basis of anal terminating a little behind base of adipose ; 

 length of caudal peduncle below, equal length of pectoral spine. Rays D. 

 1 7 ; P. 19 ; V. 8; A. 18 ; C. 16. Spine of dorsal smooth. Caudal openly 

 emarginate, the emargination much above the middle rays, giving the highest 

 a short lobate outline. Lateral line straight to scapular angle, mouth of 

 axillary mucous duct distinct. Length of head 2 in. 8 1. ; width below 2 in. 

 '2, 1. : from muzzle to base of ventrals 4 in. 3 1.; to base of caudal 7 in. 9 1. ; 

 length of caudal 1 in. 7 1. ; another specimen is about ten inches in length. 

 The color of the upper surfaces, tail, fins, barbels and under jaw is black ; 

 sides varied with dirty yellow , abdomen and thorax yellowish-white. J. 

 Stauffer informs me that the dark pigment of the skin of this animal comes 

 off upon the hands in handling it. A specimen died in twenty minutes after 

 capture, when put in water, though uninjured ; the Ameiiri, like other Cat- 

 tish, will live for many hours after complete removal from their element. It 

 is occasionally caught by fishermen, and is supposed to issue from a subter- 

 ranean stream, said to traverse the Silurian limestone in that part of Lan- 

 caster county, and discharge into the Conestoga. 



Two specimens of this fish present an interesting condition of the rudi- 

 mental eyes. On the left side of both a small perforation exists in the co- 

 lium, which is closed by the epidermis, representing a rudimental cornea ; 

 on the other the corium is complete. Here the eyeball exists as a very small 

 cartilaginous sphere with thick walls, concealed by the muscles and fibrous 

 tissue attached, and tilled by a minute nucleus of pigment. On the other the 

 sphere is larger and thinner walled, the thinnest portion adherent to the cor- 

 neal spot above mentioned ; there is a lining of pigment. It is scarcely col- 

 lapsed in one, in the other so closely as to give a tripodal section. Here we have 

 an interesting transitional condition in one and the same animal, with regard 

 to a peculiarity which has at the same time physiological and systematic sig- 

 nificance, and is one of the comparatively few cases where the physiological 

 appropiiateness of a generic modification can be demonstrated. It is there- 

 fore not subject to the difficulty under which the advocates of natural selection 

 labor, when necessitated to explain a structure as being a step in the advance 

 towards, or in the recession from, any unknown modification needful to the ex- 

 istence of the species. In the present case observation on the species in a 

 state of nature may furnish interesting results. In no specimen has a trace 

 of anything representing the lens been found. 



I am indebted to the same enterprizing Society and its Secretary for another 

 inhabitant of the Conestoga, which has hitherto escaped the notice of zoolo- 

 gists. This species, which has been distinguished by Jacob Stauffer in corres- 

 pondence, is an Etbeostoma,* one possessing the character of the genus in a

 Dorsals not in contact. Eye entering live times into length of head, more than once in muzzle

higher degree than does the hest known type, the E. blennioides. This 

 is, especially, the existence of a median abdominal series of thick shield-like 

 scales, with short mucrones radiating from the free margins. In the type of 

 the genus these scales are little larger than those of the ordinary form ; in the 

 present species they are four times the size of the largest on the body. The 

 following description will express the general characters : Etheostoma 

 peltatum Stauffer ; body and head more compressed and elevated, and the 

 muzzle longer than in E. blennioides. Four times the length of the 

 head (from below the opercular spine) extends a little beyond the base of the 

 caudal fin, commencing at the end of the muzzle. Pectoral as long as head, 

 and a little less than equal base of first dorsal. Greatest height equal from 

 end of maxillary to edge of operculum. Eye 3 times into length of head, 

 measured to below opercular spine. Breadth of body through scapular re-

gion much greater than elsewhere. Scales 53, two rows on each side the

 lateral line longest. No scales in front of the first dorsal or on the head, ex- 

 cept a very few on the operculum. A shield in the clavicular angle, one be- 

 tween the ventral fins, and six in a series commencing opposite the middle of 

 the ventrals, and extending to vent; the last double. Dorsal fins well sep- 

 arated xiii 13. Caudal deeply lunate 17 ; A. 11 ; V. 6 ; P. 14. Total tength 

 three inches. All the fins are finely barred, the ventrals but little, except the 

 first dorsal, where a series of lunate black spots occupies the middle of the in- 

 terradial membrane. The dorsal region is bright olive, with a series of short 

 brown cross-bars. The lateral region is occupied by a longitudinal series of 

 broad brownish shades ; between these and on the belly and jaws orange and 

 yellow. From spinous dorsal to occiput ; from hinder frontal region to end 

 of muzzle extending round front of orbits ; a broad perpendicular bar from 

 orbit downwards, and blotch on the operculum black. 



Jacob Stauffer informs me that its movements are quick and lively, and 

 that it presents a striking appearance in its native waters.

Of this author I am acquainted with the following works which in part 

 relate to Ornithology : 



1. Delicias Naturas Selectae, oder auserlenes Naturalien Kabinet welches aus 

 den drey Reichen der Natur zeiget, &c. 2 vols., Polio, Niirnberg, 1766, (edi- 

 tion in German and French,) many colored plates. 



2. Same work, 2 vols., Folio, Dordrecht, 1771, (edition in Dutch.) 



3. Des Ritters Carl von Linne vollstiindiges Natursystem, nach der zwolften 

 lateinschen Ausgabe, &c, an edition of the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus in 

 German, of which the Kingdom Animalia is by this author, in 9 vols., Oc- 

 tavo, 158 plates, Niirnberg, 1773 to 1776. 



There are also numerous memoirs, translations and other works, the most 

 extended and apparently the most complete enumeration of which is in En- 

 gelmann's Bibliotheca Historico-Naturalis. I have seen none other than the 

 above relating to Ornithology. 



In a series of papers, of which this is the first, I propose to bring to the 

 notice of ornithologists, a very considerable number of authors, the works of 

 whom have been either wholly or partially overlooked, or at least have not 

 received that degree of attention to which they seem to have been, and in 

 most instances are, surely entitled. All of those, whom I propose to notice, 

 have written since the era of the Linnaean binomial nomenclature. Facilities 

 unusually favorable for this descripiionof investigation exist in the library 

 of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, which is very rich in 

 Zoology, especially of the older authors, owing mainly to the scientific taste 

 and great liberality of the late Mr. William Maclure, of Dr. Thomas B. Wil- 

 son, and of Mr. Edward Wilson. Many of the most remarkable and rarest 

 works were collected in Europe and presented to the Academy by the last 

 named gentleman. 



There are also in the library of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, 

 in that of the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, and in that of 

 the Library Company of Philadelphia, valuable and but imperfectly known 

 works, which are included within the objects of my proposed series, and to 

 all of which, by virtue of their rules and through the courtesy of the officers 

 of those institutions, I have unrestricted access. I propose to notice works, 

 or parts of works, only which relate to Ornithology, and in a few instances to 

 present notices of well known authors, for the purpose of giving condensed 

 accounts of their works. 



The bibliography of Ornithology is so extensive that no naturalist has yet 

 mastered it, nor has been able to entirely appreciate and avail himself of the 

 labors of his predecessors. There is, of course, much diversity of acquire-

raent in this description of knowledge, and very generally an unqualified de- 

 sire to attain the utmost possible proficiency. Instances occur, however, of 

 exceeding ignorance and carelessness, and, in fact, it is not quite certain that 

 the general disposition to, and respect for, research and erudition has not de- 

 clined in Ornithology within the last quarter of a century, in a degree per- 

 haps unusual in the Sciences. There is no reason that erudition in the liter- 

 ature of the Natural Sciences, through knowledge of books and the fullest re- 

 search, should be less respectable than in any other department of Human Know- 

 ledge, nor that in those Sciences this description of acquirement should not be 

 more respectable than ignorance. Here, too, as everywhere else, the great princi- 

 ples of Ethics, founded in the clear truths of Religion and Nature, should be 

 allowed the most extended jurisdiction and control, without qualification. 

 The morals of the Natural Sciences, most certainly, are not peculiar in any 

 particular, nor involve principles different in any respect from those univers- 

 ally recognized in the practical pursuits of mankind, and which have elicited 

 the most cordial assent and approbation of all civilized men. Justice, Hon- 

 esty, Industry, in fact, all the great practical and household virtues are as 

 indispensable in the relations of cultivators of the Sciences past and present 

 as elsewhere ; possibly, it might be ventured to be suggested, ought to be 

 rather, the more devotedly practised by men aspiring to be authors, and as- 

 suming somewhat to be teachers of mankind. 



One prominent article of any code of zoological ethics that I might propose 

 would be, that every author should be cited, and otherwise and in all re- 

 spects treated justly and respectfully, so long as he can be found in print. 

 It is perhaps safely to be assumed, also, that all authors ought to be treated 

 courteously as well as justly, without reference to the extent of their publi- 

 cations, whether great or small. If belonging to that useful and laborious 

 class of naturalists who are essentially describers of species that class which 

 possesses real knowledge, even if without hypotheses their descriptions 

 should be cited, and themselves too, as authorities, so long as such descrip- 

 tions are known to exist. There is not, evidently, any other course consistent 

 with Justice and the plainest principles of right and morality, and, in fact, 

 no alternative, unless, indeed, an operator is disposed to set himself up for the 

 first of all history, as is said of an early Chinese Emperor. The latter course, 

 in a degree, singular as it may appear, is not entirely unknown to naturalists, 

 especially to those who regard Science rather as a Milch Cow than as a 

 transcendent Goddess a distinction in classification first made by the great 

 poet Schiller. 



Persons addicted to hypotheses, otherwise sometimes rather loosely called 

 Systematists and Generalizes, cannot be too careful in this description of 

 respectful treatment, especially in view of the fact that the descriptive natur- 

 alists and students of species possess the great fund of real knowledge ; and 

 although describers of species may be nothing else, without the knowledge of 

 such, no one can be anything else.* It is the descriptive naturalist, too, co- 

 operating nowadays with the Anatomist and Chemist, who has brought for- 

 ward the material so sharply testing the systems, that very few, iu fact nearly 

 no?ie, have stood it! The tide of time is strewed with the wrecks of Systems 

 and Generalizations, gone to a death worse than that of the dry bones of the 

 Prophet, for they can never again live. The descriptive naturalists are the 

 true rank and file, with many outriding skirmishers, and quasi great func- 

 tionaries in attendance, garrulous, perhaps, and imperious, but of little real 

 account; the true officers are from the ranks, and have worked their way. 



* Linnaeus says: "Botanices Tyro noTit Classes, Canditatus omnia Genera, Magister plurimas

 innititur omnis solida eruditio Physica, Oeconomica, Medica: immo omnis vera cognitio hurnana."

The true Sjstematist is the greatest of them, and amongst the greatest of 

 men, but comes, unfortunately, very rarely ; scarcely more than one in a cen- 

 tury. All men, or nearly so, seem capable of analysis, but true talent for 

 generalization or synthesis is one of the rarest and most precious of the 

 gifts of God. Inferences and occasional insights are accorded even to the 

 most humble, but in all those beautiful and sublime Sciences which have 

 their immediate origin in the observation of Nature, generalizations of any 

 considerable value, or the inference of laws, are not easy nor likely to be pro- 

 claimed with any flippant dogmatism, The true and faithful man of genius 

 is too surely appalled by the immensity of attempting, as Gcethe happily ex- 

 presses it, " to think over again the great thoughts of the Creator." 



The works of Prof. P. L. S. Miiller seem to have been much overlooked in 

 later times, though he was evidently well known, and is cited freely by his 

 contemporaries.* He is quite a voluminous author and translator, though 

 few of his works relate to Ornithology, those being, so far as I know, only 

 such as are cited at the head of this paper, and especially his edition of the 

 Systema Naturae. His Supplemental Volume of this edition contains a large 

 number of descriptions of species, generally abridged from other authors, 

 and binomial names given for the first time. Throughout his edition Prof. 

 Miiller avails himself largely of Van Houttyn's fine edition of the Systema 

 Naturae, from which he copies nearly all his plates, and also of Boddaert's 

 abridgement of the same, and from both of which (in the Dutch language) 

 he freely translates. The latter is his main authority for his additional spe- 

 cies. To the former I shall have occasion to allude in a future paper, but 

 Boddaert's abridgement I must here further mention, on account of its imme- 

 diate connexion with Prof. Midler's Supplementary Volume. 



In 1772, Dr. P. Boddaert commenced in Holland the publication of an 

 abridgement of the Systema Naturae of Linna?us, under the title " Kortbegrip 

 van het Zamenstel der Natuur, van der Heer C. Linnseus, met zeer veele 

 zoorten vermeerdert door P. Boddaert Med. Doct.," of which I have seen one 

 volume only, of 550 pages, octavo, containing the classes Mammalia and 

 Aves. In this work Dr. Boddaert gives all of the species of Quadrupeds and 

 Birds contained in the twelfth edition of the " Systema Naturae, " with the 

 scientific names of Linnaeus carefully stated, and with abridged descriptions 

 in the Dutch language. He adds to those Linnaean species many others, 

 mainly from Edwards, Catesby and Buffon, but especially the last named, 

 citing constantly " Buff. Hist. Nat. Ois," the volume and page frequently, and 

 always the plate of that distinguished author's great work universally known 

 as "Planches Enlumine:es." To the species added by him he does not (in 

 this work) give scientific names, but contents himself with popular names 

 only, which are generally translations into Dutch of those given by other 

 authors, and especially of the French names of Buffon. 



It may not be improper to state, though without immediate connection 

 here, that subsequently, in 1783, Dr. Boddaert gave scientific names himself 

 to many of the species described and figured by Buffon, and of which he had 

 previously given condensed descriptions in his " Kortbegrip." The title of 

 this subsequent work is "Table des Planches Enlumineez d'Histoire Natur- 

 elle de M. D'Aubenton. Avec les denominations de MM. de Buffon, Brisson, 

 Edwards, Linnaeus et Latham, precede d'une Notice des Principaux Ouvrages 

 Zoologiques enluminees, par M. Boddaert, Med. Doct." Utrecht, 1783, 1 vol., 

 small folio, 83 pages. Many of the names proposed by him in this work, and 

 which are now generally adopted, are anticipated by those of Prof. Miiller. 



In 1773, the author now before us, Professor Philipp Ludwig Statius Miiller, 



* Donndorff, Zoologische Beytriige, Leipzig 1795, constantly gives " Miiller Natursyst." as his 

 first authority. Cite;l also constantly in Martini's ' : Allgemeine Geschichte der Natur," in Mar- 

 tini and Otto's edition of Buffon, in Goeze's " Europaische Fauna," and hy various other authors. 



[Oct. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 237 



commenced at Nlirnberg the publication of an edition in German of the " Sys- 

 tema Naturae" of Linnaeus, under the following title: " Des Ritters Carl von 

 Linn, Koniglich Schwefaischen Leibarztes, &c, &c, vollstandiges Natur- 

 system, nach der zwolften lateinischen Ausgabe und nach Anleitung des 

 holliindischen Houttuynischen Werks, mit einer ausfiirlichen Erkliirung 

 ausgefertiget von Philipp Ludwig Statius Muller, Prof, der Naturgeschichte 

 zu Erlang und Mitglied der Rom. Kais. Akademie der Naturforscher, &c." 

 which was completed by him to the end of the Animal Kingdom. This work 

 is contained in seven volumes, so styled, but bound in nine thick octavo vol- 

 umes, including a " Supplements und Register Band," the date of publication 

 of which is 1776, and of which it is especially the object of this paper to 

 give some account.* 



This edition of Prof. Muller contains all the species given in the twelfth 

 edition of the "Systema Naturae," and in the Supplementary Volume he 

 gives a large number of others, which are (as he states in the preface) from 

 the " Addenda, Appendices und Mantissas des Ritters von Linne\" and the 

 works of " Buffon, Schreber, Boddaert, Pallas und andern." The numbering 

 of species under each genus is continued from the twelfth edition of the 

 " Systema Naturae." 



In this volume Prof. Muller gives nearly all of the species of Birds des- 

 cribed by Buffon, not previously given by Linnaeus, and generally translates 

 the Dutch names and descriptions of Boddaert's " Kortbegrip" into German. 

 To very nearly all of his additional species, and perhaps especially to those 

 from Boddaert, he gives scientific and strictly binomial names, which are, for 

 many species, the first ever given to birds described and figured in Buffon's 

 " Planches Enlumin^es." As stated above, Boddaert gave names himself to 

 many of the same birds in 1783, but the date of Muller's Supplement is 1776, 

 thus having clear priority. 



In his Supplemental Volume, Prof. Muller gives a large number of species 

 in other classes, and names some species of Quadrupeds, Reptiles and In- 

 sects apparently for the first time. His "Register fiber samliche sechs Theile 

 des Linneischen Thierreichs," in the same volume, appears to be a complete 

 catalogue of all the species of Animalia contained in the twelfth edition of 

 the Systema Naturae of Linnteus, and seems to have been prepared very 

 carefully. It is superior to Gmelin's Indices, (Syst. Nat. i. pt. vii.) 



The following are the species of Birds given in this Supplementary Vol- 

 ume, and regarded by Prof. Muller as additional to the species of the Systema 

 Naturae. Those species which appear to be named for the first time are here 

 given in small capitals. 



The numbering of genera is the same as that of Linnaeus, and the number- 

 ing of species is continued in the order of the twelfth edition of the Systema 

 Naturae. I have not attempted to give those species their places in modern 

 genera, but quote only as synonymes the names of Boddaert, Gmelin and 

 others.

 however, that I have various other authors in view for introduction to orni- 

 thological society, without being as yet quite sure what figure they will make, 

 nor what established relations they may disturb. 



In the " Deliche Naturae Selectae," Prof. Muller is associated with Georg

 Crustacea, Insects and Minerals. This work only relates to Ornithology in

Synopsis of the Eastern American SHARKS. 



BY THEODORE GILL. 



In the present article, I indicate the imperfection of our knowledge respecting 

 the American Sharks, and have endeavored, as far as possible, with my limited 

 materials, to rectify the synonymy. It will be perceived that I have connected 

 names, proposed by Mitchill and others, with species belonging to different 

 t'*milies from those to which they had been previously referred. No specific 

 contradiction in the descriptions existing, and the diagnoses essentially agree- 

 ing with the species, it is probable that in such cases the generic relations of 

 the species were assumed without verification of the geueric characters. lint 



[Nov. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 259 



when, as in the case of Carcharias griseus* of Mr. Ayres, the generic position i6 

 not only assumed, but the characters forced to agree with it, tyros might be 

 readily misled, and only knowledge of correlation of essential characters will 

 enable the scientist to arrive at correct conclusions. As I have had the power 

 of examining Odontaspidoids from the same neighborhood which agree, in fa- 

 mily characters, with those species described by scientilic naturalists, and 

 which essentially agree in other respects with Mr. Ayres' description, I identify 

 them with bis species without hesitation, although I cannot adopt the name, 

 since it had received two others previously. I may add that its true relations 

 have been appreciated by both Messrs. Desor and Storer. 



As already intimated, this contribution must be considered rather as an ex- 

 position of our present ignorance of the species, than the embodiment of the 

 correct nomenclature. It is not too much to say that the titles of half the spe- 

 cies to their names require to be confirmed. Although I have seen more or 

 less of most of these species, the want of opportunity to compare them with 

 others, and the critical nature of the characters distinctive of species in this 

 order, forbid the idea of correctness in every instance. As, however, much good 

 may often be done by the mere exposition of our deficiencies, this article is 

 submitted with the hope that it may at least excite investigation. 



The synonymy of the American forms is alone introduced.

If there is any actual difference bptween the American and European represen- 

 tatives of this genus, they have not yet been pointed out ; the example of pre- 

 vious authors in referring both to C. maximus is, therefore, still followed. The 

 synonymy of the American fish is alone given.

" The first dorsal fin is one foot in length." 



" The second dorsal is one inch long." " The anal fin is one inch long." 



"The upper lobe of the caudal fin measures two feet over its curvature ; the 

 lower lobe measures one foot and a half." 



These measurements of the fish, called by Dr. Storer C. obscurus, are incom- 

 patible with any form of the family of Galeorhinoidee ; the description is only 

 reconcilable with Carcharodon. I had, however, at one time supposed that it 

 might be referrible to Uulamia,* the notice of the dentition, except as to number 

 of teeth (i) in which it agrees with no shark, being vaguely applicable. 



The Carcharias Atwoodi is also probably the same species, the anal being 

 said to be far behind the second dorsal, and thus distinguished from the " white 

 shark." Dr. Storer doubtless obtained his idea of the latter from Yarrell's 

 copy of Belon's figure, which erroneously represents a Carcharodon with the 

 anal opposed to that fin. 



Having been shown a tooth of a Galeoccrdo, said to have been taken from C. 

 Atwoodi, I have asked whether that species could have belonged to that genus, 

 but the position of the anal and the triangular teeth forbid such identification.

This species of the eastern coast is probably identical with Isuropsis glaucus, 

 said by Muller and flenle to be a native of Java. As it has not. however, been 

 found there by the indefatigable Bleeker, and has been eliminated from the re- 

 cent enumeration of the species of the Archipelago, it is probable that such 

 habitat is erroneous, and that the specimen described was obtained from Suri- 

 nam. Prof. Poey has found apparently the same species at Cuba.

The Carcharias obscurus (Storer) must be considered under two beads: 



1st. The fish mentioned in the report, which is a species of Carcharodon. 



2d. Another individual ident ; fied by Dr. Storer with Carcharias obscurus, and dissected by Dr. 

 Wyman, whose description (Boston Proc. iv. 123, 1851) of its viscera, Ac, indicates th&t it belonged 

 to the Galeorhini. The specimen examined by that accomplished anatomist was doubtless the 

 Eulamia Milberti, and consequently related to the true Carcharias obscurus.

 lower, and having a process on the lower side." Hitch. Trans. N. Y. i. 485. 



% Eugomphodus is distinguished from Carcharias (Rat.,) Trigloch\s or Odontaspis by the simple 

 first and fourth teeth of the upper jaw, as well as the first of the lower. The more anterior dor- 

 Mla also separate it from O. taurus.

The specific name here adopted was applied in MSS. by Valenciennes to a 

 specimen sent from New York by Milbert, and was retained for a species to 

 which that specimen, one from Leyden and one in the Museum of Berlin, ob- 

 tained by Hemprich and Ehrenberg, were referred. The specimen on which the 

 description and measurements were especially based is not specified. The de- 

 scription agrees quite well with the Carcharias cxruleus of DeKay. 



The Carcharias cxruleus was established on a young female, and the Lamna 

 caudata on the figure of an adult female obtained from Mr. Brevoort, to whom 

 I have been indebted for the information. 



That gentleman has shown to me the original drawing of which DeKay's fig- 

 ure was a professed copy. It is drawn with Mr. Brevoort's wonted accuracy, and 

 distinctly represents the last branchial apertures above the pectoral fins ; the 

 species is, therefore, a true Eulamia, as its form indicates, and as was suspected 

 by Dr. Gray. 



With the European form, Nardo has identified his Squalus plumbeus as well as 

 the S. Ccecchia of Chiereghin.

Messrs. Putnam and Nason have favored me with notices and partial figures 

 of a shark taken on the coast, and preserved in the Museum of Williamstown 

 College, which appeared to apply to this species. It is scarcely necessary to 

 remark, that the teeth, represented by Lesueur, have been reversed, the wider 

 one belonging to the upper and the narrow to the lower jaw.

"The caudal fin very unequally divided ; the tipper section being almost thrice 

 as large as the lower, and having a process on the lower side." (Mitchill.) 



The Squalus punctatus, therefore, cannot be a species of Lamna as long sup- 

 posed, nor yet a species of Eulamia, Platypodon, or even Scoliodon, with which, 

 smonQ- known American species, it can alone have affiities.

As already indicated by Muller and Henle,(p. 189), the S. terrse.-novse of Rich- 

 ardson evidently belongs to the genus Scoliodon as now understood, and has 

 no affinity with Lumna to which it has been referred by several authors.*

 15oreogaleus Gill. 



Galeocerdo tigrinus M and H. 

 Galeus macwlatns Ram. 



To this species I refer two jaws, said to have been obtained on the eastern 

 coast, and others from the West Indies, Lower California and the Western Pa- 

 cific. The jaws are from adult fishes, and resemble in the form of the teeth 

 the G. arcticus. 



Muller and Henle distinguish two species of Galeocerdo. 



G. tigrinus with, 1, a moderate flat snout; 2, teeth 25 } coarsely serrate, and 

 the unpaired one little bent, and with an entire terminal point ; 3, elongated 

 caudal; 4, spotted body ; 5, last two branchial apertures above the pectorals ; 

 6, anal fin, with the anterior lobe little produced and rounded. 



G. arcticus with, 1, a very short snout ; 2, teeth 2.?, finely crenulated, the un- 

 paired teeth curved and crenulated throughout; 3, caudal moderate; 4, imma- 

 culate body ; 5, fifth branchial aperture only above the pectorals ; 6, anal with 

 its anterior lobe much produced and pointed. 



Placing an undue value on these differences, I formerly proposed to generi- 

 cally distinguish G. arcticus. 



To Prof. Poey I am indebted for the figure of an adult Galeocerdo, exhibiting 

 the gills aud anal fin of G. tigrinus, but the form and teeth of G. arcticus ; he 

 believe3 that his fish is only the adult form of G. tigrinus, and I am obliged to 

 agree with him in this view. Tbe body, and especially the caudal and snout, 

 became abbreviated with age, and the teeth change. The jaws seen by me 

 exhibit variations in number from 21 to 23, but none 25. Can the latter for-

 with its periphery convex. Eyes moderate, with the pupil vertical. Nostrils 

 nearer the front of the rcouth than the snout, nearly rectangular to mouth, 

 with the anterior flap small and near the inner angle. 



Mouth moderate, but convex in front, and wider than deep. 



Teeth of upper and lower jaws dissimilar; of each jaw mostly similar, but 

 smaller and more oblique towards the corners of the mouth ; two symmetrical 

 front. ones iu upper, an unpaired one in lower jaw; the two front teeth of the 

 upper jaw inclined towards each other ; the rest serrated, oblique, rectilinear or 

 nearly so along the inner edge, and with an obtusely angled emargination at the 

 outer edge, the lower branch of which forms the so-called heel. Lower jaw 

 with a small azygous erect tooth at symphisis; the rest with broad bases and 

 narrow oblique entire or weakly crenulated cusps, inclining more as they re- 

 cede from the symphisis. 



Branchial apertures moderate; the fourth, typically, nearly above the outer 

 base of the pectoral fin. 



Dorsal fins dissimilar ; the first nearly midway between the pectoral and 

 ventral fins, or little nearer the former, moderate, obtusely produced at the 

 anterior angle, and acutely prolonged at the posterior ; the second small, narrow, 

 produced acutely from the posterior angle. 



Anal fin nearly opposite the second dorsal, slightly larger than the latter, 

 obtusely enlarged at the anterior angle, acutely produced at the posterior. 



Caudal fin above with a pit at base, normally prolonged, and with a moderate 

 lower lobe, narrow towards its rounded apex.

This genus was first named in the " Analytical Synopsis of the Order of

 in the dissimilarity of the teeth of the two jaws, the two paired teeth of the 

 front jaw, and, perhaps, in the form of the mouth and narrower caudal portion 

 of the tail. Squalus tiburo Poey, S. acronotus P. and S. obscurus Les., belong 

 to it. 



Notes of an Examination of the Birds of the Subfamily COEBEBIN.E.

1. Genus COEREBA, Vieillot. 



Coereba, Vieill., Ois. d'Am. Sept. ii. p. TO (1807). 

 Arbelorhina, Cab., Schomb. Reisen iii. p. 675 (1848). 



This name is now almost universally applied to the group for which I use 

 it in this paper, and of which the bird described by Linnaeus as Certhia cyanea 

 may be presumed to be the type. Vieillot, as above cited, evidently adopts 

 it as a name for a group which he regarde'd as a genus, intending to include 

 that species (C. cyanea) to which the name Guira-coereba Brasiliensibus had 

 been previously given by Marcgrave and Piso in Nat. Hist. Brasil, p. 212. It 

 was not the usage of Vieillot nor of numerous other binomial authors, inclu- 

 ding Linnaeus, to assume any one species as the type of a proposed or adopted 

 genus, and in my opinion there is a very considerable degree of impropriety, 

 as well as injustice, in ascribing to those authors any other than their real 

 and palpable intentions. For genera, the names of which are adopted from 

 other authors and the same groups intended to be designated, those authors, 

 whether ante- Linnsean or other non-binomia', (or any other,) ought to be con-

suited and the types ascertained in that manner, whenever it becomes neces- 

 sary. 



It will be found on reference to Ois. d'Am., Sept., as cited above, that the 

 only species of his genus Coereba given by Vieillotis Coereba Jiaveola, supposed 

 to be the same as Certhia jiaveola, Linnaeus. According to the views of some 

 distinguished and judicious authors, that species should be regardsd as the 

 type of the genus, and the name Coereba should therefore be applied to a group 

 since designated, and now well known as Certhiola. In such view, I cannot 

 coincide. 



Dr. Cabanis, as above, proposes the name Arbelorhina as a substitute for 

 Coereba, apparently objecting to the barbarous origin of the latter. His type 

 is C. cyanea.

 variously labelled Cayenne. Brazil, Trinidad, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, of 

 which localities I know several to be correct. There is appreciable difference 

 between them in the size and degree of curve in the bills, but all are exceed- 

 ingly alike in colors. Specimens from Venezuela have the largest bills, and 

 it happens also that one specimen in the Massena collection, marked " Carac- 

 cas," in the hand-writing of M. Victor Massena, has the smallest. These 

 large-billed specimens from Venezuela may be entitled to specific distinction, 

 and, in addition to their larger size, seem to have with some uniformity a 

 greater extent of the black of the lores, completely enclosing the eye and ex- 

 tending behind it. A specimen from Panama, belonging to the Smithsonian 

 Institution, has the same character, but is smaller in all its parts. The Mexican 

 and Central American bird mayalso be distinct, and entitled to the name 

 given by Dr. Sclater, as above cited, but probably not on account of having 

 the legs red. I suspect that the adult bird always has the legs of that color, 

 in whatever locality ; and. in a very interesting and valuable paper on the 

 birds of the West Indies, Mr. E. Cavendish Taylor says of the bird found in 

 Trinidad : " Its legs and feet are bright red." (Ibis, 1864, p. 81). 



There are at present fourteen mounted specimens of this species in the 

 Academy Museum, and numerous others in skins, not exhibited. Notwith- 

 standing the small differences in specimens, as above, I find it impossible to 

 distinguish Dr. Cabanis' species brevipes and eximia in the collection.

 cies I take specimens with a medium-sized bill, as nearly as possible like the 

 figure in Edwards' Birds, above cited, on which this species is founded.

Arbelorhina longirostris, Cab., Mus. Hein., p. 96 (1851). 



Coereba trinitatis, Bonap., Compt. Rend., 1854, p. 258. 

 Seven specimens, all labelled " Trinidad " and " Caraccas," and strongly- 

 characterised by their long and stout bills. The females seem to have the 

 throat more clearly ochre-yellow than in those of other species, and perhaps 

 the longitudinal stripes on the under surface of the body wider and less nu- 

 merous. The Prince Bonaparte cites " Sparrm., Mus. Carls., pi. 80," as pos- 

 sibly this species ; but evidently erroneously, as that plate (Mus. Carls., pi. 

 80,) represents the very smallest of Sparrmann's proposed species. 



4. Coereea brevirostris, (Cabanis). 



Arbelorhina brevirostris, Cab., Mus. Hein., p. 96. 

 Four specimens, labelled "Bogota," " Guayaquil," and " Cayenne." That 

 from Guayaquil may be distinct, and seems to have the black gular patch 

 narrower ; the black space on the lores seems to be larger, and the light blue 

 of the forehead ends in a sharp angle at the base of the bill.

Jard. Orn. Contr., 1850, pi. 66, fig. 1. Reich. Voeg. ; fig. 3772. 



Five specimens, differing in size somewhat, but very similar in plumage. 

 One specimen, which is the original of the figure in Jardine's Contributions, 

 cited above, is labelled "Upper Amazon ;" two others are labelled "Guaya- 

 quil," and two are from Peru, presented by Hon. John Randolph Clay, late 

 U. S. Minister to that Republic. 



One specimen from Guayaquil, and the specimens from Peru, are very con- 

 siderably the largest, quite sufficiently so to be regarded as distinct, on the 

 terms which seem to prevail in this genus. The specimen figured as above 

 is the smallest, though apparently quite adult. The figure alluded to is a 

 mere caricature ; the wing too long, the tail too short, and the transverse 

 black bars awkwardly attempted to be shown on the abdomen are purely 

 imaginary, there being no such in the specimen. 



9. Entire upper parts green, rather lighter than in the female of C. coeru- 

 lea and C. longirostris. Under parts dull white, strongly tinged ,with ochre 

 yellow on the throat and breast and under tail coverts ; longitudinally striped 

 with green on the sides and abdomen. Wing brownish black, all the quills 

 widely edged with green; tail brownish-black, two middle feathers green, 

 and all the other feathers widely edged, and tipped with green. Bill dark ; 

 legs light colored. 



6. Coereba lucida, Sclater.

 Strictly of the same general form as the preceding, but singularly different

Eighteen mounted specimens in Acad. Mus. Of this apparently abundant 

 and widely diffused species, there are four varieties in the specimens before me, 

 which, though I cannot at present regard them as species, appear to be well 

 marked, and may be sufficiently constant and perhaps local, to be entitled to 

 specific distinction. On this view of specific identity, the names above are 

 given as synonymes, the first name being that of Linnaeus, in the tenth edi- 

 tion of Systema Naturae, in which the species is founded on Edwards' plate 

 25, fig. 1, and no other authority cited, except fig. 2 of the same plate, which 

 is given as a variety. In the twelfth edition, the name Spiza is continued, and 

 the tenth edition cited, Brisson being cited only as an additional synomyme. 

 This species is in nowise founded on either Brisson's description nor on 

 Seba's figure, and consequently the remarks of several distinguished orni- 

 thologists, and the adoption bj* them of Vieillot's name atricapillas are not 

 correct. I distinguish the following varieties : 



a. C. Spiza, (Linnaeus.) Edwards' Birds i., pi. 25. 



Very nearly of the size given by Edwards in the plate cited, and smaller 

 than C. guatemalensis, Sclater. The black of the head extending to the occi- 

 put, wings and tail brownish black, the feathers of the latter and quills edged 

 externally with green. All other parts of the plumage fine lustrous yellowish 

 green, occasionally with a bluish gloss in some lights. Total length, about 

 5% inches. "Cayenne," "Trinidad." 



b. C. guatemalensis, Sclater. 



Larger than the preceding, and with the black of the head extending more 

 fully upon the occiput. The green of the plumage of a lighter shade. Total 

 length, about 5| inches. Guatemala, " Nicaragua," Mexico. 



c. C. CvErolescens, nobis.' Aud. & Vieill. Ois. Dor. pi. 47 ? 



Quite as large as C. guatemalensis, and with the black of the head having 

 about the same extent. All the plumage (except the black parts) bluish 

 green, especially to be observed on the under parts of the body. In all other 

 varieties the fine lustrous green of the plumage changes to blue in a limited 

 degree, but in this variety the blue color appears to be constant, and changes 

 to green in some exposures to the light. Total length about 5J inches. 

 Specimens in the Acad. Mus. are from M. D'Orbigny's collection, and are la- 

 belled, in the handwriting of M. Victor Massena, " C. Spiza? No. 149, D'Or- 

 bigny, Juracares, Bolivia." 



d. C. melanops, nobis. 



Smaller than either of the two varieties immediately preceding, and about 

 the size, or rather smaller than the first variety here given (C. Spiza). Black 

 of the head much restricted, and extending about halfway only between the 

 front and occiput, or but little beyond the eyes. Green feathers of the occiput 

 and back of the neck having a strongly defined or scale-like character. Green 

 parts of the plumage much as in the variety C. Spiza, but with the green edges 

 of the quills and tail feathers wider and more clearly defined. Total length 

 about five inches. Two specimens,^ and $,in Acad. Mus., labelled in 

 Europe, in a handwriting that I do not recognize: " 2873, 3045, Certhia Spi- 

 za? Rio Negro, Ameriq. M^rid." 



3. Genus DACNIS, Cuvier, Reg. An., i. p. 395 (1817). 

 Of this genus I have seen the following species : 



A. Cyanodacnis. 



i 

 1. Dacnis cayan'a, (Linnaeus). 



Motacilla cayana, Linn., Syst. Nat., i. p. 336 (1766). 



[Nov.

 Dacnis cyanater, Less., Tr. d'Orn., i. p. 458 (1831). Puch., Rev. et Mag.

Briss. Orn., iii. pi. 28, fig. 1, 4. Buff., PI. Enl., 578, fig. 1. Sw., Zool. 111., 

 ii. pi. 117. 



Under this name I place numerous specimens of a common Brazilian spe- 

 cies, the males of which are clearly the bird figured by Swainson, as above 

 cited. It is not so clear to me, however, that they are precisely that figured 

 and described by either Erisson or Buffon. The former is the authority for 

 the species Motacilla cay ana, Linn. (Briss. Orn., iii. p. 534), and I am not with- 

 out a suspicion that either a smaller species, next following in this paper, 

 or that D. coerebico/or, Sclater, is entitled to this name. The description by 

 Lesson is short, and applicable to both species, but relying on the locality 

 given by him, " Bresil," it is possible that his name, D. cyanater, is the proper 

 designation for the present bird. 



This species is larger than that immediately following, and has the black 

 space on the back larger. It is well represented in Swainson's plate, cited 

 above, and is commonly brought in collections from Bahia and other localities 

 in Southern Brazil. 



2. Dacnis nigripes, Pelzeln?

Edwards' Birds, vi. pi. 263. Beckl., Nouv. Mem. Acad. Moscow, vii.pl. 23 ? 

 Pelz. Sitzungb. Akad. Vienna, 1856, pi. 1, fig. 1.? 



This is, in my opinion, a species distinct from the preceding, though re- 

 sembling it in colors. It is smaller, and has the black space on the back 

 smaller and more strictly defined. It is figured by Edwards, as above cited, 

 and also seems to be the bird given by Becklemichew, whose name I should 

 be inclined to adopt, were it not anticipated by Vieillot, for the species of this 

 genus usually given as Dacnis pi 'umbea. (Latham). It may also be the species 

 described and figured by that excellent ornithologist, St. Pelzeln, as above 

 cited, but the legs in dried specimens are not black. Ten specimens in the 

 Academy Museum I regard as this species. They are labelled as from Cay- 

 enne and Northern Brazil. 



3. Dacnis ultramarina, Lawrence. 



Dacnis ultramarina, Lawr., Proc. Acad., Phila., 1864, p. 106. 

 From the Isthmus of Panama. This is another species of the same group 

 as the two preceding, and resembling them in colors. It is, however, of a 

 different and deeper blue color, and has the black of the throat distinctly 

 tinged with green. It is described, and its peculiar specific characters are 

 stated with his usual precision and judgment by Air. Lawrence, as cited 

 above.

for examination by that gentleman. It is a strongly characterized species, 

 not intimately resembling any other at present known, and easily recognized 

 by its scarlet tibia, which is quite a peculiar and curious character in this 

 group. From Panama, very handsomely figured in the Ibis, as above.

 latter character being particularly observable. It is without label statin a- 

 locality. This specimen is sufficiently dark-colored to resemble the pre

 of that species. Under tail coverts dark chestnut.

Numerous specimens, several of which are labelled "Cayenne " Undoubtedlv 

 the species described and figured by Vieillot and the Prince de Wipd h, 

 very doubtfully that of Latham. The description by Latham, from a specimen 

 m the Lever.an Museum is short, but he says: "plumage above deep lead 

 color, nearly black,' which is difficult to apply to this bird, though his natae 



[Nov.

is usually given for it, and regarded as synonymous with those above given. 

 Latham says further: " native place uncertain," (Gen. Syn. Supp., p. 188). 



This species has the bill and general structure more Sylvia-form than 

 others of this group.

Three specimens, one of which is labelled "Cayenne." The smallest species 

 of this group, easily distinguished by the green color of the upper parts of 

 the body, and light blue head. Though well described and figured by my 

 friend Mr. Giraud, of New York, as above cited, this little bird seems to be 

 unknown to naturalists. It belongs strictly to the same group of species as 

 the two species immediately preceding, (Z>. speciosa and D. bicolor). I regard 

 it as possible that this bird is the female or young of D. speciosa,

tittensis, Lesson, Cayenne." One specimen, evidently not in mature plumage,

 by its white throat, which color is narrowly enclosed between the dark brown 

 of the cheeks.

 to be one of the smallest of the group, the specimens before me being even 

 smaller than the measurements given by Dr. Reichenbach, (Spec. Orn., pt. v. 

 p. 252). Total length 3J inches. 



The genus Certhiola is the most difficult of this group, and although the 

 species have been indicated with singular ability by Dr. Cabanis, and subse- 

 quently more fully described by Dr. Reichenbach, they are not to be dis- 

 tinguished in most cases (as at present described,) without careful scrutiny. 

 In addition to the preceding species, I have seen one other specimen, not in 

 good condition, in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, from Peru, 

 which is apparently another and probably undescribed species.

presented by Dr. Thomas B. Wilson, seem to be C. Fraseri, Sclater, as above, 

 and are only different in having the under parts of the body and the super- 

 ciliary lines more strongly tinged with rufous, though my impression is that 

 they are specifically identical with D'Orbigny's bird. 



One specimen in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution is the most 

 mature and strongly characterized that I have seen, and is very nearly as 

 represented in D'Orbigny's plate, above cited. It is quite possible that C. 

 Fraseri is the young of a species allied to the present, but not identical.

 Allied to and resembling the next two species, but easily distinguished from 

 either, when in adult plumage, by the darker shade of color of the upper parts, 

 and by the extension of the same color on the sides of the neck and throat, 

 though there is usually a narrow space on the latter communicating with and 

 of the same rufous as the under parts of the body. This species is about the 

 same size as D. similis, with which it can readily be confounded. It is smaller 

 than D. sittoides. Mr. Gray gives this little species with his usual great care 

 and accuracy in the plate above mentioned. 

 Specimens are labelled "Mexico."

Numerous specimens, generally labelled " Bogota " and " Columbie." This 

 species is about the size of the preceding (Z>. baritula), and much resembles 

 it, but is readily distinguishable by its throat being clear rufous, uniform with 

 the other under parts. It resembles, even in a greater degree, the next spe- 

 cies {D. sittoides), and in adult plumage is distinguishable only, so far as I 

 can see, by its smaller size. The female of this species seems to present a 

 peculiar character in having the under parts of the body with longitudinal 

 stripes of dull olive, not very distinct, but to be traced in all specimens that 

 have come under my notice. Dr. Reichenbach's figure, cited above, is a 

 good representation of this little bird.

 Young birds, labelled " U. Orbignii" are in the Acad. Mus., but the adult 

 is in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, and is precisely as given by 

 Mons. D'Orbigny in the plate cited. This species is larger than either of the 

 two preceding species, but is exceedingly similar in other respects to D. si- 

 milis. The specimen now before me has the under parts rather paler rufous, 

 but is, in fact, scarcely distinguishable from that species, (/). similis,) by 

 any other character than its greater size, though I have no doubt that it is 

 quite distinct, specifically. From Bolivia. I regard it as possible that this 

 bird is the young or female of D. brunneivenlris, Lafresnaye.

 being blue, nearly uniform with the entire other plumage. In fact, until un- 

 doubted specimens of the next immediately succeeding (D. indigotica) were 

 received at the Acad. Mus., I had regarded it, doubtfully, as that species, 

 though much too large. This specimen resembles Reichenbach's fig. 3752,

The material whence the present synopsis is derived, is a? collection sent to 

 me by Prof. Manly Miles, of Lansing, composed of specimens belonging to the 

 Flint Scientific Institute, to the State Agricultural College, and to the State 

 Collection. As we have but few exact synopses of local collections made at 

 the Northwest, it is hoped the following list may prove of value in indicating 

 the general character of this part of the fauna.

anterior position to the adipose fin, which the latter do not exhibit, and 

 though Rafinesque assignes fifteen anal rays and mine have 23 and 24, I prefer 

 doubting the infallibility of these statements to giving another name to the 

 Michigan fish ; it is in any case no other described species. 



Noturus flavus. No. 294, Swartz Creek, Genesee Co. 



Sis large specimens, not apparently differing specifically from smaller indi- 

 viduals from the Youghiogheny and Susquehanna Rivers. Some, however, 

 have but nine branchiostegals instead of ten in the eastern specimens. 

 The orifice of the duct of the poison gland* is irregular in position, being some- 

 times at the base of the posterior pectoral rays, and sometimes even on the 

 side behind the fin, besides in its normal location below the scapular process. 

 From it may frequently be drawn a solid gelatinous style ending in a tripod, 

 each limb of which is dichotomously divided into short branches of regular 

 length. 



Teleocephali. 



Eventognathi. 

 Semotilus corpo r ali s, Putnam, not Abbott. Many specimens from near 



New Hudson, Oakland Co., from Swartz Creek, Genesee Co. and from 



Grosse Isle. 

 The Semotilus rhotheus has been regarded by my friend F. W. Putnam, 

 as identical with this species (vid. Bulletin Mus. Comp. Zool.,p. 8,) although 

 I pointed out the differences in my first description (Proc. A. N. S., 1861, p. 

 564,) when I employed the name cataractus for corporalis. The latter 

 occurs sparingly in the tributaries of the Delaware, but is very common in 

 the affluents of the Susquehanna and Ohio. The former is rare west of the 

 Delaware, where it is abundant, and reaches a large size. S. dissimilisf 

 and pallidus are good species from west of the Mississippi.

P. communis as follows :

Ventrals acuminate, reaching anus. Ventrals truncate, falling far short of anus.

 3 lines. Above ruddy ash, a faint longitudinal dark band on one row of scales above lateral line. 

 Below yellowish white, lips and chin yellow; suborbital region ruddy. 



JTo Ceratichthys must probably be referred the Leueiscus d i s s i m i 1 i s Kirtld., a common fish 

 in the tributaries of the Ohio. The general appearance differs considerably from that of th other 

 species, especially in the mor prominent muzzle, and, therefore, inferior mouth; but I find no 

 ordinary characters indicating a different genus. 



Ceratichthys micropogon is a species sent me by Jabob Stauffer, Secretary of the Linnaean 

 Society, of Lancaster, and was taken in the Oonestoga by a member of the Society, on one of its 

 excursions. The appearance of the head of this fish is that of a Hypsilepis rather than of a chub, 

 and the difficulty of discerning the minute barbels increases the liability to err in determining its 

 affinities. Mouth slightly oblique, angle opposite anterior border of orbit. Latter enters 3y times in 

 length of bead, which is measured 3 J times in length from muzzle to base of tail. The greatest depth 

 is measured 4 times in the same distance. Head broad, muzzle obtuse, profile rounded descending. 

 Caudal peduncle long. Scales, as in C. biguttatus, |?40. Teeth 4 4, without proper masticatory 



surface, the posterior considerably hooked. Length, from origin of tail to anterior base of dorsal 

 equal from dorsal to posterior nostril. Kays. D. 1-8; C. 9; A.l 7; V. 8 ; P. 13. Above pale

of caudal.) Anterior base of dorsal measures one-half the distan3e from 

 end of muzzle to base of tail. Lateral line nearly straight. Operculum 

 rounded posteriorly, scarcely concave above. Eye contained 5J times in 

 length of head. Scales J41 ; radii fewer and weaker than inbiguttatus. 

 Dermal head tubercles longest on vertex, smallest on muzzle, in four alternat- 

 ing rows, one on each side becoming superciliary. Fins, D. 1*9 ; P. 15 ; V. 

 1-8, just reaching vent ; A. 1-8 ; C. 19. The dorsal and anal are much pro- 

 longed posteriorly, the greatest horizontal length of the former nearly equalling 

 the length of the upper surface of the head. Six and eight inches are the 

 longest dimensions before us. Color of upper surfaces olive brown ; below, 

 from above lateral line, yellowish ; preopercular region rosy ; pectorals slightly 

 dusky, otherwise no fin markings. 



This fish is shorter, stouter and blunter than the biguttatus, and has 

 larger dorsal and anal fins, there being one more ray in the latter. The oper- 

 culum is not so angulated or concave above. 



In some of the specimens of this species, especially among the half-grown, 

 I find a tooth of the second row of pharyngeals, found in Semotilus proper. 

 Nevertheless the barbel is on the end of the maxillary, as in the type of Cera- 

 tichthys, and not above it, as in Semotilus. Specimens from Grosse Isle, from 

 Waterford, Oakland Co., from Clinton River and from Bruce, Macomb Co., 

 Michigan. 



Ceratichthys stigmaticus, sp. nov. 



Dorsal outline rising gradually from end of muzzle to base of dorsal fin. 

 Muzzle projecting a little beyond premaxillary outline. Head (equal greatest 

 depth) 4 limes in total length ; eye 3^ times in length of head, its superior 

 rim upon the frontal plane. Scales ?40. Radii about 15 exposed, stronger 

 than the concentric lines. Fins short, ventrals a little anterior to dorsal, not 

 reaching the vent. D. 1-8; C. 20; A. 1-7 ; V. 8. From basaof caudal to 

 anterior base of dorsal, equal from latter to posterior nares. General color 

 reddish, operculum and cheeks more silvery. A brown band from muzzle to 

 eye, and a very distinct spot at base of tail. Total length, two and a half 

 inches. Pharyngeal bones stout, the superior limb broad ; teeth 1*4 4 : 1. 

 Barbel on the end of the o. maxillare. 



Rhinichthys 1 u n a t u s, sp. nov. 



Stout, the head broad, and contained four times in length to base of tail. 

 Greatest height 4 times in the same. Dorsal fin a little behind opposite 

 ventrals ; latter reaching anal. Caudal lunate, or with a broad shallow 

 emargination. Eye a little less than one-fourth the length of the head. About 

 twenty longitudinal rows between dorsal and ventral fins, and sixty traversed 

 by the lateral line. From end of muzzle to base of first dorsal ray equal from 

 latter point to concavity of caudal. Muzzle projecting just beyond mandible. 

 Rays, D. 1-8; C. 19 ; A. 17 ; V. 18 ; P. 15. The largest specimens are 2 

 inches long. 



Above reddish brown, with irregular, rusty spots, which in small specimens 

 trace a lateral shade, and extend on the abdomen ; usually the latter is un- 

 spotted silvery. 



Specimens from Grosse Isle, obtained by Prof. Fox. This fish is stouter than 

 the a t r o n a s u s, has a smaller eye and a less deeply forked tail, besides the 

 difference in color. Marmora tus has a longer nose, (one more anal ray) 

 and a caudal spot. From obtusus, meleagris and nasutus* it can 

 also be readily distinguished. 



* Another species, brought by Dr. Hammond from Kansas, has not been described. Rhinichthys 

 maxilloBus is peculiar in its heavy muzzle, and broad mouth, aud gular region, and tor an 

 elongate form and backward position of fins. Eye with considerable vertical range, entering 5 S 

 times into length of head, latter four times to base of tail. Greatest height five and a half times

Numerous specimens from Grosse Isle, Detroit River, Three Mile Lake and

Specimens from the last locality, seven in number, represent a strongly- 

 marked variety, characterized by the great elevation of the outline in front 

 of the dorsal fin, and other points. From the first dorsal ray, the outline 

 again descends, giving the fin a very oblique position : this extends also, 

 when laid back, as far as above the fifth anal ray, while in frontalis it 

 most usually reaches a point opposite the first ray only. The eye is contained- 

 four times in the length of the head more frequently four and a half times 

 in f r o nt al i s. The length of the head measures in the depth of the body, 

 from the dorsal outline to the middle of the row below that bearing the 

 lateral line ; it extends nearly to the ventral outline in frontalis. The 

 pharyngeal bones appear to be relatively rather stouter than in typical 

 frontalis, and are not furnished with so prominent an inferior angle to 

 the external ala. This, with the form of the body, would almost indicate a 

 species ; but as I find approximations in these and transitions in the other 

 characters, I cannot so consider it. In H. frontalis the number of scales 

 traversed by the lateral line varies from 38 to 43. 



Hypsilepis cornutus Bd. 



Specimens from Pine Lake, Emmet County, Bruce, Macomb County, and 

 one from Swartz crek, agree with the many Susquehanna specimens in my 

 possession in a more elongate form of head and body than specimens from 

 tributaries of the Delaware. They often differ from those of the Susquehanna 

 in having a row of scales or two more below the lateral line. In Delaware 

 specimens the head is shorter than in the latter, not more so than in the for- 

 mer, but the depth of the body is greater than in either, entering in length 

 to base of tail 3i times in the others 4 and 4^ times. The dorsal fin is a 



behind ventrals, like the anal slightly concave on the border. Caudal not deeply forked. Kays, 

 D.I 8; C. 19; A. 1 7; V. 7 ; P. 13. Twenty-five rows of scales trim dorsal to ventral. Largest, 

 specimen nearly 3 inches. Silvery. Pale cinnamon above ; a dark lateial shade; yellowish below. 

 A dark spot at base of caudal. 



Hybopsis phaenna is a species found in some of the tributaries of the Delaware, which I 

 have received from Trenton, N. J., from my friend Charles C. Abbott. It is more elongate in form 

 than H. hudsonius and storerianus, and has not the rounded front of the first or the small, 

 compressed head of the last. Eye a little less than one-third length of head ; latter 5% times to 

 concavity of tail, and more than equal greatest depth of body ; in s t o r e r i a n u s the head does 

 not equal the depth, and the back is nure compressed Angle of mouth not posterior to anterior 

 nostril. Scales ^38. Lateral Hue very slightly deflected opposite dorsal fin. Base of caudal to 

 posterior edge of dorsal equal from latter to beginning of skin of head. Rays D. l - 8; C. 19; A. 

 1-8, its outer border concave like that of dorsal ; V. 19 ; P. 15. Length 4 inches. 



Lateral band and below silvery, a dark shade passing through former; no spot at base of tail. 

 Above pale ochre, with a faint median line. 



The operculum of this fish is narrower than that of the hudsonius, rather than broader as 

 in amarus, and the head is longer than in the latter. In stOTerianus the mouth is smaller, 

 and the operculum broader, and with a prominent superior angle. The gracilis is said to have 

 the pectorals reaching the ventrals, which I have not seen in any of the species at my disposal. 



f Cyprinella, distinguished from Hypsilepis by its crenate teeth, must receive the Leuciscus k e n- 

 tuckiensisof Dr. Kirtland. It is abundant in the tributaries of the Ohio, where it represent* 

 the nearly allied C. analo s tana, Gird., of the Susquhanna and Delaware. The differences be- 

 tween these species are as follow :

little more anteriorly situated in the Delaware specimens, and there is a row 

 of scales more below the lateral line than in Susquehanna specimens. With 

 typical specimens only, these might be regarded as representing two species, 

 and as such I have already alluded to them ; * but in the large number of in- 

 dividuals at my disposal, I find transitions in all the points. The Delaware 

 specimens more nearly resemble the H. cornutus, figured by Dr. Storer. 



Squalius proriger. 



Until more characteristic points are presented, I provisionally preserve un- 

 broken a series of beardless Chilognath Cyprinoids, with pharyngeal teeth 

 2 or 14 or 5 : 5 or 4 1 or 2, of the type uncinato-subconici raptatorii, and 

 not crenate ; the scales, with the usual extent of surface exposed ; the 

 isthmus not wide, and tbe anal fin short. The long anal fin dis'inguishes 

 Albnrnus from it ; and the narrow exposed scale surface and masticatory 

 teeth, Hypsilepis. Clinostomus Gir., may be said to be distinguishable by the 

 prominent mandible and large gape, but Sq. lepidus (Heck. Fische Sy- 

 riens, 89, ) is quite similar in the former point, and the Clin, photogenisf 

 has the cleft as short as in most Squalii. Ptychochilus Ag. seems not yet 

 to have been sufficiently distinguished from Clinostomus, and resembles 

 Squalius even more in its terminal mouth. If different genera are here united 

 erroneously, it is because their characters have as yet not been pointed out. 

 They embrace five Pacific slope species, six Eastern American, and many 

 from the old world. 



In the species now named the prolongation of the lower jaw is very great : 

 it presents a symphysial knob beyond and above the premaxillary border. 

 End of the maxillary opposite the middle of the pupil. Angle of opercular 

 outline less than 90. Head narrowed anteriorly ; eye four times in its 

 length : latter four times in length to concavity of tail. Greatest height 5| 

 times in the same. Ventrals a little in advance of dorsal : from front base of 

 latter to base of tail equal from former point to half way between end of muz-

 more projecting under jaw than the S. elongatus. 



It resembles an Aspius no little, but differs in the shorter anal, and fewer 

 pharyngeal teeth. The Alburnus acut us, badly described by Lapham, is 

 evidently an allied species. 



Two specimens ; exact locality in Michigan not stated. 



Since the above was penned, I have found that Bleeker (in Comptes Ren- 

 dus xv. 1863,) has united the genera which I have attached to Squalius to 

 Aspius, placing Squalius with Teleates, Scardinius and Cyprinella as syno- 

 nymes of Leuciscus. That Squalius and Telestes are identical, I fully believe ; 

 but if Cyprinella and Scardinius are not different from Leuciscus our ideas 

 of characters must undergo a change. 



Plargyrus americanus. 



From Saginaw Bay, No. 253, and a variety from Grosse Isle, Detroit River, 

 distinguished by its very elongate form, especially in regard to its caudal pe- 

 duncle. Scales |46 ; that is, two rows less above the lateral line than in many 

 high-bodied specimens ; there are others quite intermediate. 



Chrosomus e o s Cope, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., Philadelphia, 1861, 523. 



From New Hudson, Liviugston County, from streams flowing into Lake 

 Erie. Larger specimens of this species exhibit a short lateral line, though in 

 many it is wanting. Its points of separation from erythrogaster are as 

 follows : 



ery throgaste r. 



Head less than one-fourth length to 

 base of caudal. Head narrower ; pa- 

 rietal width one-fourth distance from 

 base of first dorsal ray to base of 

 caudal, which is equal from first dorsal 

 ray to nares. 



Muzzle longer, overhanging, angle 

 of mouth opposite nares. 



Scales above lateral line 24 rows. 



e o s. 



Head more than one-fourth do. Head 

 broader ; parietal width one-third from 

 first dorsal ray to caudal, which equals 

 from dorsal to posterior margin of or- 

 bit. 



Muzzle shorter, mouth more oblique, 

 reaching edge of orbit. 



Scales above lateral line 18 rows. 



Alburnops heterodon. 



A species having the general structure of Alburnops, and pharyngeal teeth 

 usually, but not always, presenting its characteristic masticatory surface. 

 They have sometimes a trace of the creuulation pertaining to Cyprinella, and 

 are arranged usually in but one row of four on each side, which is sometimes 

 accompanied by a single tooth of the inner row. This species is, therefore, 

 allied to Codoma, Cyprinella and Squalius. Scales f 36, with about eleven 

 distant radii on the rather broad exposed surface. Fissure of mouth not 

 reaching line of orbit. Head one-fourth of length to base of tail, a little 

 greater than greatest depth. Diameter of eye one-third of length of head. 

 Operculum higher than long. Outline from end of muzzle to base of dorsal 

 greatly ascending. Greatest breadth of head one-fourth of the distauce from 

 end of muzzle to base of dorsal. Dorsal high ; the bony ray long ; its front 

 ray to the hinder as 2- to 1, and contained 2i times in the distance from its 

 base to the origin of the caudal fin : like the ventrals, it is nearer the end of 

 the muzzle than the base of the caudal. Ventrals reaching anus ; pectorals 

 falling much short of ventrals. Rays, D. 48 ; A. 8 ; V. 8. 



Length two and a half inches. 



Above yellowish-brown ; the scales darker bordered ; below yellowish- rosy, 

 or sometimes goldeD. A dark lateral band from end of muzzle to tail, which 

 is covered on the sides by a silver band with blue reflections. 



Numerous specimens from Lansing ; others from Grosse Isle.

Albarnops plnmbeolus. 



Form compressed ; mouth oblique ; mandible slightly more prominent than 

 premaxillary border. Eye 2f in length of bead ; operculum higher than long ; 

 the superior border very short ; the supero-posterior concave : posterior an- 

 gle more than 90. Length to base of tail a little over four times length of 

 head, and 4f the greatest depth. Frontal and dorsal outline a gentle arch. 

 Anterior base of dorsal half way between base of caudal and end of muzzle. 

 Height of dorsal less than half length from its anterior base to base of caudal. 

 Fins short ; ventrals extending way to vent. Scales moderate f 39, with seven 

 or eight rather faint radii, and minute numerous concentric lines. Radial for- 

 mula D. 18. A. 19. V. 8. P. 13. 



Length three inches. Pharyngeal bones with strong ala, especially dilated 

 on the superior angle, terminating in a sharp angle opposite the second tooth 

 from above ; lower limb long ; teeth 2, 4 4, 2. 



Everywhere silvery, with a blueish reflection, except a dusky vertex and 

 brownish dorsal region and basal caudal spot. 



From Flint, on a branch of the Saginaw. 



I have regarded this species as an Alburnops on account of the distinct 

 masticatory surface of the teeth, although the upper jaw does not overlap the 

 lower as in the types of that genus. The form of the scales distinguishes it 

 readily from Hypsilepis. It is generally similar to Squalius. 



Alburnus* rubellus Agass. 



The anal fin of this fish is shorter than in true Alburnus : teeth 2, 4 4, 2, 

 without masticatory surface. Scales f 38. Head 4j times in length to base

Pimephales m i 1 e s i i, sp. nov. 



A species differing from the promelas in its larger scales, longer muzzle 

 and other points approximating Hybognathus. 



Mouth oblique, outlines of snout forming less than a right angle in profile. 

 Eye entering Ah times in length of head, which latter is one- fourth of length 

 to base of tail, and equal to greatest depth of body. Scales ^40, nearly round, 

 lateral line extending as far as the fourteenth. Dorsal fin with 1, 9 rays ; 

 the first and last jointed are equal, the middle the highest. Caudal wide ;

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 283 



One specimen from Grosse Isle, Detroit River. 



Though differing in the development of the lateral line, this species stands 

 near Pimephales in the character of the separation of the bony dorsal ray from 

 the first cartilaginous by a membrane, (erroneously alluded to by some as a 

 peculiar ray,) and in the arrangement of the tubercles on the front. Of the 

 latter, there are two rows crossing the front of the muzzle ; the inferior of six, 

 of two on each side on the premaxillary border, and the outer near the eye ; 

 the superior of five, one on the middle line. A third row of four is on the 

 border of the superior plane, one behind each pair of nares, and one on each 

 side the middle line of the muzzle. 



Hybognathus stramineus. 



This genus embraces the described species argyritis. evansi, nu- 

 chalis, nitidus, regius and probably g a r d o n e u s (C. V. ), to which 

 are added here three others. 



In the present species, the dorsal is situated nearer the end of the muzzle 

 than to the base of the caudal, and its height is much less than half the dis- 

 tance from the base of its first ray to the same point ; the head enters the 

 length to the caudal a little over four times, being relatively longer than in the 

 species described by Agassiz and Girard, while the eye, entering the length of 

 the head but three times, is relatively larger. The depth enters the length 

 4^ times. Scales f 36 ; in evansi* f 40. Ventral fins do not extend to the 

 vent. The dorsal outline rises gently to the base of the dorsal ; the profile 

 descends abruptly at the end of the muzzle, which is prolonged in front of the 

 orbit about three-fourths the longest diameter of the latter. Superior border 

 of operculum usually shorter than the posterior. Pharyngeal teeth 4 4. 



The general form is stout, and the head broad ; caudal not deeply forked. 

 Fin rays -D. 1. 8. C. 19. A. 7. V. 8. P. short, 13. Length about three 

 inches. Color brownish straw color ; sides and below silvery, the former 

 most brightly. No dorsal line ; a faint line on posterior part of lateral line, 

 and a small spot at base of tail. 



Many specimens from Grosse Isle, Detroit River. 



Hybognathus v o 1 u c e 1 1 u s.f 



A species distinguished by its depressed elongate head and elongate fins, 

 especially the dorsal. The latter is as far from the end of the muzzle as from 



but differs in the much more posterior position of the fins. In this, the anterior base of dorsal is 

 equidistant between end of muzzle and base of tail: in the antica much behind the median 

 point; the ventrals are much nearer the caudal than the chin; in the formosa, the reverse is 

 the case. Scales - 1 % 50. Head in adults a trifle more than one-fourth total length; eye one-fifth 

 length of head. Maxillary not reaching line of margin of orbit; mouth oblique. Profile long, 

 flat, descending; dorsal outline arched. Body of medium proportions, shortened behind; caudal 

 Peduncle short, thick, Fins, D. 1 7 A; C. 19, short, emargination shallow; A. 18; V.9; P. 16 



Sides of head and edges of scales punctulate; general tint above purplish-slate; below, with 

 sub- and inter-operculum, yellow. Largest specimen five inches long. In some small specimens 

 the eye is only one-fourth the length of the head. To the allied genus Lavinia belongs most pro- 

 bably the Leuciscus boscii of Cuv. et Val., from Carolina. The same genus occurs in Lake 

 Ponchartrain. 



* Brought by Hammond from the Upper Platte. 



t Hybognathus procne has been sent me by my friend, Jacob Staaffer, as an inhabitant of 

 the Conestoga, tributary of the Susquehanna. A small silvery fish, with compiessed body and 

 elongate caudal peduncle. Head enters total length 4% times ; diameter of eye into head 2% or 

 three times. Depth into length five or a little more times. From anterior base of dorsal to base 

 of caudal longer than from former to end of muzzle; dorsal high, anterior rays equal % from 

 their base to base of caudal. Scales j? 31. Tail entering total length 5i%. times, deeply forked ; forks 

 acute. Obliquity of mouth slight. Operculum higher than long; its infero-posterior border very 

 oblique, long. Teeth R. 5 4 L. Length 2 - 5 inches. 



Top of head, a narrow dorsal band, and the borders of the upper scales blackish; belly and 

 ides of body and head silvery, along the middle line with blue reflections and black punctulations, 

 the latter collected into a streak on the lateral line. Belly yellowish.

its anterior ray to the base of the caudal fin. Its anterior rays are three 

 times the length of the posterior, and equal to half the length from their base

Campostoma callipteryx, sp. nov. 



Lips well developed, free round the arched margins of both jaws. Muzzle 

 elongate, steeply descending from front ; outline to half way to dorsal strongly 

 but less steeply ascending. Eye superior, small, entering five times into 

 length, and nearly four times into breadth of head ; latter four and a half 

 times into length to emargination of caudal, a trifle less than greatest depth. 

 Ventrals under anterior margin of dorsal, not reaching to vent ; anal rounded 

 anteriorly. Scales with many weak radii, f 54, a much narrower area ex- 

 posed anteriorly than posteriorly. Caudal acute above, rounded below. 

 Radii, D. 1. 8. C. 19. A. 1. 8. V. 8 one side, 10 the other. P. 16. Pharyn- 

 geal teeth uniserial, 4 4. From end of muzzle to anterior base of dorsal in 

 a straight line, equal from base of caudal to middle of base of dorsal. Head 

 above with spinous tubercles. 



General color pale, dorsal regions and edge of operculum darker. Median 

 part of all the fins black, terminal membrane opalescent. Total length 5^ 

 inches. 



From Flint on the Flint River, which empties into Saginaw Bay. 



For distinguishing this genus from Chondrostoma I have relied on the less 

 number of teeth in the principal, usually the only, row. The development 

 of the lips diminishes in allied species, so that Girard's Hybognathus pla- 

 c i t u s cannot well be excluded from this genus. 



Campostoma mormyrus, sp. nov. 



Muzzle more elongate and much more depressed than in the next species. 

 Head four and one-half times in total length to caudal emargination ; eye five

Notes on some Species of BIRDS from South America. 



BY JOHN CASSIN. 



I. Calliste Laving, Cassin, (Plate 1, fig. I.) 



Calliste Laviniae, Cass. Proc. Acad. Philada., 1858, p. 178. 



This bird was described by me as above from a specimen procured in New 

 Grenada, and which is yet the only adult that I have seen. In the museum 

 of the Smithsonian Institution there is another specimen from the mountain 

 region of the Rio Truando, a tributary of the Rio Atrato, New Grenada. The 

 latter specimen is not in mature plumage, but has the outer webs of the quills 

 and the greater coverts of the rufous-orange color, which, on those parts, so 

 strongly characterizes this species, and distinguishes it at once from its allies 

 of the subgroup Gyrola. The adult bird is represented of the natural size, in 

 plate 1, fig. 1, of the present volume. 



Of this group or subgenus Gyrola, four species are now known, which, 

 though resembling each other in general colors, may be readily distinguished, 

 and inhabit, apparently, distinct regions. 



These species are : 



1. Calliste Gyrola, (Linnaeus.) 



Fringilla Gyrola, Linn., Syst. Nat. i. p. 181 (1758.) 



2. Calliste Gyroloides, (Lafresnaye.)

4. Calliste Lavini^, Cassin. 



Calliste Lavinia, Cass., Proc. Acad. Philada., 1858, p. 178. 



[Dec. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 287 



All of these species are in the Academy Museum, and of the first three nu- 

 merous specimens. Those three species are accurately and handsomely 

 figured by Dr. Sclater in his Monograph of the genus Calliste. 



2. Calliste Eannahi^:, nobis, (Plate 1, fig. 2.) 



Resembling generally C. cyaneicollis (D'Orbigny,) but is rather larger, has 

 the bill much smaller, and the abdomen always black (not blue as in that 

 species.) The blue of the head above is also different in shade, being paler 

 in the present bird, and this color has much greater depth, each feather being 

 black at base, and with its terminal half pale verditer blue. 



Entire head verditer blue, tinged with indigo blue on the throat ; back and 

 entire under parts lustrous black ; shoulders golden green ; greater coverts 

 yellowish green ; rump and upper tail coverts lustrous bluish and yellowish 

 green. Quills black, edged externally with bluish green ; tail black, all the 

 feathers narrowly edged with green ; under tail coverts black, with bluish 

 green edges ; under wing coverts black ; bill and feet black. A narrow frontal 

 band and stripe in front of the eye black. 



Total length about 5 inches ; wing 2| ; tail 2 inches. 



Hab. Merida Mountains, Venezuela. 



Of this bird, I have now two specimens, one of which was brought from the 

 locality above given, by Mr. George Robbins of this city, and which is un- 

 doubtedly correct. At first sight it much resembles C. cyaneicollis, but is 

 not difficult to distinguish by the abdomen being quite black, uniform with 

 the other under parts, and by the different blue color of the head, as above 

 mentioned. The small bill in the present bird is also a strong character. 



Numerous specimens of C. cyaneicollis are in the Philadelphia Academy, 

 two of which are types from M. D'Orbigny's collection. All of them, and all 

 others that I have seen, have the blue abdomen well marked as a character, 

 and in one evidently quite mature specimen, marked "Chili," this character 

 is so strongly developed and the blue color extends so far upwards towards 

 the breast, that it seems to have induced some attention, and the specimen 

 has been labelled in Europe " Esp. nouv. ?" In this specimen and others, 

 the blue of the head is quite superficial. One other specimen, from M. D'Oj- 

 bigny's collection, is in young plumage, but has the abdomen blue, though 

 that color is only incipient on the top of the head. All have the bill larger 

 than the present species. Our figure represents this bird of the size of life. 



To one possessing attributes amongst the most noble of Christian civiliza- 

 tion, an affectionate and most exemplary wife and mother, this bird is dedi- 

 cated !

 Of this curious bird no other specimens have come under my notice, than 

 those described as above, which were obtained in the Cordilleras Mountains in 

 New Grenada, by Mr. Charles J. Wood, of this city. It is given in our plate, 

 of the natural size.

 bird have been received from Panama by Mr. George N. Lawrence, of New 

 York, who notices them in his interesting and valuable papers on the birds 

 of that isthmus, in the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of that city. 

 The figure in our plate represents the adult male, and is about two-thirds of 

 the size of life.

lication of the description above cited. The figure in the plate accompanying 

 this paper, is about two-thirds of the size of life, and represents the adult 

 male from the mountain region on the Rio Truando, a tributary of the Rio

 I mention this species only for the purpose of again stating, that its name 

 is that of the Baron Lafresnaye as above given. The type specimen, now in 

 the Academy Museum, was described by him while in possession of Messrs. 

 Verreaux, of Paris, and the same specimen was described by Strickland, while 

 afterwards it was in England en route to Philadelphia.

 Buff. PI. Enl. 330. 

 Of this species which seems to be little known to naturalists, one specimen, 

 evidently in mature plumage, is in the Academy Museum, and was received 

 some years since from the Hon. John Randolph Clay, in a collection made by 

 him while Minister of the United States to Peru. The skin was one of several 

 which had the appearance of having been made by a non-expert person, and 

 is stated to have come from the mountainous region of the interior of that- 

 country. This species is figured by Buffon, as above cited, with sufficient ac- 

 curacy for recognition.

 Curators were read, as follows :

REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



For 1S64,. 



The Curators report the Museum of the Academy to be in its usual good 

 order and state of preservation. Some of the departments are still but par- 

 tially arranged, and, under existing circumstances, the Curators see no way of 

 completing the arrangement unless they are authorized by the Academy to em- 

 ploy aid for the purpose. Mr. Tryon has undertaken the arrangement of the 

 conchological cabinet, and Mr. Durand has expended much labor in the ar- 

 rangement of the recent rich additions to the herbarium. 



Notwithstanding the extensive additions made in late years to the building 

 of the Academy, the Curators feel the necessity of more space to accommodate 

 the constantly increasing collections. Nearly all the departments are crowded, 

 some of them to such an extent that it has become difficult to introduce a few 

 additional specimens. It is to be hoped that the Academy will direct especial 

 attention to the necessity of making future and ample provision to accommo- 

 date, display, and render convenient to access, the incessantly increasing 

 museum and library. 



During the year the Academy has been greatly enriched by a donation con- 

 sisting of the magnificent Herbarium of the late Prof. Charles W. Short, of 

 Louisville, Kentucky, presented by the family on the recommendation of Prof. 

 Asa Gray, of Cambridge. A special notice of this collection will be found in 

 the Report of the Botanical Committee appended to the present one. 



Another rich addition, a legacy of our late" fellow member, Samuel Ashmead, 

 formerly one of the most efficient Curators of this Institution, consists of a 

 first selection from a large and valuable private collection of about 20J0 

 minerals, together with a beautiful collection of marine algae, made with con- 

 siderable labor and expense during the later years of Mr. Ashmead's life. 



Our stores have further been increased, through the American Philosophical 

 Society, by the deposit of the natural history collection of that time-honored 

 Institution. 



By resolution of the Academy, a small collection of ancient works of art 

 have been deposited in the museum of the American Philosophical Society.

 lusca, and 294 species of shells, mostly American, mainly collected and labeled 

 by W. Stimpson. George W. Tryon, Jr., presented 163 species of shells, mostly 

 new to the museum of the Academy. Dr. Gundlach presented 20 species of 

 Cuban shells. Of others, 16 species were presented by A. A. Gould, I. Lea, J. C. 

 Fisher and J. H. Thomson. A small collection from the Florida Reef was 

 presented by George Davidson. The American Philosophical Society depo- 

 sited a small collection of shells. 



Articulates. The Smithsonian Institution presented 62 species of crustace- 

 ans, mostly from the collection of Dr. William Stimpson, of the North Pacific 

 Exploring Expedition. Other crustaceans, insects and myriapods were presented 

 by George Davidson, Rev. R. H. Nassau, F. R. Bingham, Dr. J. C. Fisher and 

 H. L. Gaw. 



Echinoderms, fyc. The Smithsonian Institution presented 16 species of echi- 

 noderms from the collection of W. Stimpson, of the North Pacific Exploring 

 Expedition. Small collections of marine animals were presented by Rev. R. 

 H. Nassau, Dr. J. C. Morris, S. Powell and George Merritt. A small collection 

 of echinoderms, corals and sponges were deposited by the American Philo-

Fossils. E. D. Cope presented 14 specimens of vertebrate liassic fossils 

 from England. Small collections and specimens were presented by Gen. John 

 F. Hartrauft, Lieut. A. W. Guernsey, Jacob M. Kunkel, Dr. J. Leidy, F. Peale, 

 Col. W. D. Lewis, Jr., J. F. Frazer, R. E. Knight, J. C. Trautwine, Mr. Painter 

 and Geo. W. Ward. The American Philosophical Society deposited a collec- 

 tion of green-sand fossils from New Jersey and Delaware, a collection of 

 European tertiary fossils, small collections from various formations and locali- 

 ties, and a number of casts in plaster of the vertebrate fossils of the vicinity 

 of Paris. 



Minerals. About 500 specimens of minerals were received as a legacy from 

 the late Samuel Ashmead, of which about 400 have been labelled and inter- 

 calated with the mineralogical cabinet of the Academy. The mineralogical 

 collection, deposited by the American Philosophical Society, contains many 

 rare and valuable specimens, among which are rich native silvers, sulphurets 

 of silver, tin, opal, &c, from Mexico. From this collection upwards of 450 

 specimens have been labelled and intercalated with the cabinet of the Academy. 

 Altogether there have been added to the latter during the past year, about 

 1000 labelled specimens. Mr. Lea presented 27 specimens of minerals from 

 Chester and Lancaster Co., Pa., and from New York. The Smithsonian In- 

 stitution presented 27 specimens of rocks. Joseph Wharton presented 18 



[Dec. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 291 



minerals from Lancaster Co., and 8 specimens were presented by J. D. Ser- 

 geant, W. S. Vaux and J. C. Trautwine. There were also obtained 12 valu- 

 able minerals in exchange. 



Botany. The magnificent herbarium of the late Professor Short, of Louis- 

 ville, Ken., presented by his family, consists of almost 300 folio volumes, 

 containing about 6000 species of American plants, and between 3000 and 4000 

 species of European plants, besides a number of unopened packages of tropical 

 American plants. The collection of marine algae of the late Samuel Ash- 

 mead, a legacy to the Academy, is contained in 12 thick quarto volumes. Be- 

 sides these there are numerous microscopic specimens mounted in the usual 

 manner on glass slides. A collection of marine and fresh water algae, com- 

 prising about 700 species, a contribution by Leo Lesquereux to the Central 

 Sanitary Fair, has been purchased by the Curators, according to a resolution of 

 the Academy, of Dec. 6, 1864. Two large fungi were presented by A. Cun- 

 ningham and. Violetta W. Miller. 



Miscellaneous. An antique stone hammer from the copper mines of Lake 

 Superior was presented by B. A. Hoopes ; an Apache Indian skull from Texas 

 by Dr. E. H. Abadie ; 6 worked flints from Abbeville, France, by F. Peale ; 

 and a plaster cast of the Neanderthal skull by E. D. Cope. 



Respectfully submitted by JOSEPH LEIDY, 



Chairman of the Curators. 



REPORT OF THE BOTANICAL COMMITTEE, 



For 1864. 



To the Curators of the Academy of Natural Sciences : 



Gentlemen: Since my last report, dated December 17th, 1857, our Botanical 

 Department has been considerably enriched. 



First, by a full set of specimens from the collections made on the Colorado 

 Mountains by Dr. C. C. Parry, Messrs. Elihu Hall, Harbour and Howard. 



Secondly, by the magnificent herbarium of the late Prof. Charles Wm. Short 

 of Louisvillp, presented to our Academy by his family, on the liberal recom- 

 mendation of Prof. Asa Gray. 



Thirdly, by the handsome collection of Marine Algae, bequeathed to this in- 

 stitution by our late fellow-member, Mr. Samuel Ashmead. 



Fourthly, by another most valuable collection of Algae, once the property of 

 Mr. Leo Lesquereux, of Columbus, Ohio, presented by him, as his contribution, 

 to the Philadelphia Sanitary Commission, and just purchased by the Curators. 



To the above I will add the Texas collections of Dr. Lincecum and Mr. Buck- 

 ley ; the herbarium of Dr. G. Watson, and several hundred plants from Wis- 

 consin and Iowa received from Mr. T. J. Hale, in exchange. 



The greatest part of the Colorado specimens were either new to our North 

 American herbarium, or duplicates (handsomer and more complete) of those 

 collected by Mr. Nuttall, in his rapid travels over the Rocky Mountains. 



The Short Herbarium is, indeed, the greatest acquisition ever made by our 

 Botanical Department, and will constitute two distinct large herbaria : one of 

 tropical, the other of extra tropical plants. The latter, already arranged by 

 Prof. Short himself, on the same Linnaeo-natural plan as our general herba- 

 rium, contains, as far as I can judge, about 4000 European and between 6 

 and 7000 North American species. Among the latter are many new plants to 

 our Botanical Department, derived principally from the last collections of Mr. 

 Charles Wright in New Mexico, Sonora and Cohahuila; from the Texano- 

 Mexican herbarium of Berlandier ; from the Collection of Ervendberg in the 

 province of Huasteca, and other Mexican plants from the collection of Drs. 

 Gregg and Coulter, besides a small number from the North American British 

 provinces. 



1864.] 




292 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



This herbarium is, perhaps, not excelled in the scientific world for the mag- 

 nificence, freshness and completeness of its specimens, and the costly style 

 with which it has been fitted up. It is contained in upwards of three hundred 

 wooden cases, elegantly shaped in the form of folio volumes, each volume ave- 

 raging from thirty to fifty specimens, enclosed separately in sheets of fine white 

 paper ; the large genera or several of the kindred genera under a colored cover, 

 and the American kept apart from the European, each in its portfolio. 



The tropical plants are yet in numerous unopened packages, consisting of 

 HoUon's Flora Neo-Granadina, 1852-53 ; Fendler's Plantse Venezuelanse, 1854-57; 

 Couthony and Jameson's Plants of the Andes of Quito ; R. C. Alexander's Plantoz 

 Jamaicenses ; Cb. Wright's Plantse Cubenses, &c, &c. When these collections 

 are properly arranged, they will constitute an almost complete equatorial her- 

 barium of about 6000 species. 



Besides the above collections, I have to mention a package of East India 

 Ferns, collected by Dr. Griffith ; another of Australian Al'gse, with other minor 

 packages of Gryptogamous plants, and the two fine volumes of American Musci 

 et Hepaticse by Mr. Win. S. Sullivan, all derived from the splendid Short-Her- 

 barium. 



Mr. Asbmead's collection of Algae is, I believe, principally composed of 

 American species. It is neatly set up in twelve elegant cases, in the form of 

 quarto volumes. 



The Lesquereux's collection is particularly \aluable,containing over 700 

 species authenticated by the best Algologisls of the age, Messrs. Lenormand, 

 Desmazieres, Agardh, Mongeot, Meklenbeck, Bonjean and others, among which 

 Mr. Lesquereux's name is not to be passed in silence. 



Respectfully, E. Dcrand, 



Chairman of the Botanical Committee.

 with the By-Laws, with the following result :
