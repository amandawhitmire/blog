In the Catalogue of Amphibia in the collection of the British Museum, and in that of the Jardin des Plantes, the following species of tortoises are mentioned as coming from the United States.
In the English Catalogue are described Emys rivulata, E. scripta, E. Holbrookii, E. macrocephala, and E. Bennetii.
Not having these, and knowing that the descriptions must have been taken from dried and faded specimens, or from such as were bleached by long immersion in 190 [October, alcohol, 1 do not hesitate to pronounce them as having no real existence as distinct species, or at most as bcin;| slight variations from others well known and Ions; ago dotermmiMl.
Till' Kinosternum DouMedayii, however, forms an cxceptiitn.
It appears to be certainly a new and hitherto iindescribed animal, altiidnjih what iMr.
Gray says of it is scarcely sulficient to distin-^uish it.
M. Duiin-i il's K. Idbyrinthica seems to be nothin;; more than E. hier.i^lyphica of Ilolhrook, slightly varying in the dispo-iition of the iriarks and lines on the shi-ll ; his Kiiiii.iti'rnum cruentatum is probably not I'rom this country; it is a well marked and isio)i.';.
— Length of head i of an inch; greatest breadth 2 inch; length of head and body 2 inches; of posterior extremities 3 inches; of anterior IJ inches.
Habitat.
— Near the Gaboon River, Guinea.

ATIIERINID^.
This family heretofore composed of the single genus Atlterina, having been made on our part the subject of much research, is now understood by us in the following manner.
The Genus ATHERINOPSIS, Girard, Which we have recently established, is to receive such species as have no palatine teeth, with both jaws equal, and the snout more or less rounded.
Atheriiia metiidia, Limn., and A. notaia, Mitch., will come under this denomination, alongside wiih A> califomiensix, Girard.
The Genus BASILICHTHYS, Girard, is characterised by the protrusion of the upper jaw beyond the lower; adding to that feature small teeth on both jaws, none on either the vomer or palatines, the intermaxillaries constituting the upper arcade of the mouth, with the maxillaries placed behind them, and the upper surface of the head scaly ; including : 4.

Notice of some Fossil Bo7ies discovered hy Mr. Francis A, Lincle, in the ba?iis of the Ohio River, hidiaiia.
By Joseph Leidv, M.D.
Through the kindness of my friend.
Dr. J. G. Norwood, of New Harmony, Indiana, I have had the opportimity of examining a collection of fossil bones, which were obtained by Mr. Francis A. Lincke, from the banks of the Ohio River, near the mouth of Pigeon Creek, a short distance below Evansville, Indiana.
The bones are usually found in this locality sticking in the bank, vpb^n the water in the river is low.
The specimens are thoroughly impregnated with oxide of iron, which also erves as a cement to adhering pebbles, sand, fragments of Unios, and shells of she species oi Mela7iia canalic^data, Paludinu, iwiiderosa, etc.
200 [November, The collection contains bones of the followiii'^ animals : — Megalonyx Jefkersonii, Harlan.
aTwo tibial diaphyses of the left side of young individuals.
b.
A vertebra deiitata.
e. A fraijment of an os calcis.
d. A metacarpal and a metatarsal bone.
e. An ungual {)ha!anx.

a.
A fragment of a cervical vertebra.
Cervi;s Virginianus (^fossilia).
a. Proximal half of a tibia.
b. Distal half of a tibia.
c. Proximal half of a metacarpal bone.
d. Proximal and distal halves of two metatarsal bones.
e. Portions of two scapula.
/.
Proximal portion of a first rib.
g. The mutilated cranium of a doe.
h. The superior portion of the cranium of a buck ; the antlers having been shed.
f. Three portions of as many lower jaws of different ages.
One contains the back five molars very much worn away ; a second contains the last two molars a little worn; and the third contains all the molars, but the last temporary one has not been shed, nor is the last true one protruded.
All these specimens correspond in size with the same parts of large individuals of the existing Cerrus virgitiianns, and have the same form ; and they probably belonged to the same species.
Besides these specimens, fossil bones of a deer not larger than the CervKs t'irginiatiu
