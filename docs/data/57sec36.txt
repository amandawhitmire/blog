CATALOGUE OF THE LAND AND FRESH-WATER MOLLTJSCA OF TAIWAN (FORMOSA), WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND Y. HIRASE.
Early in the present year Mr. Okiira, collecting for Mr. Hirase, proceeded to Taiwan (Formosa), with instructions to confine his attention chiefly to collecting land shells.
He succeeded in getting a large number of species, but many of them only in small quantity, so that the expedition, while laborious and expensive, was hardly productive of so large a supply of specimens as anticipated.
The number of species taken (71) was, however, greater than any previous naturalist has obtained, and adds largely to our knowledge of the distribution of known species, besides augmenting the total number of land snails known by the discovery of some 27 new species and 13 subspecies.
The number of species taken is so considerable that it has been thought useful to add the names of all previously known Formosan snails, making the list complete for the island.
Our first knowledge of Formosan land and fresh-water shells was from specimens collected by H. B. M. Vice-Consul Robert Swinhoe, who, though chiefly interested in the higher Vertebrates, accomplished a vast amount of work on invertebrate groups as well.
His first sending of land shells to Hugh Cuming, in London, was worked up by Dr. Pfeiffer,^ the marine and fresh-water forms being identified by H. Adams and Cuming himself, and the list published by Frazer.^ Subsequent sendings were described by Henry Adams.
^ Few if any additions were made to the list of land snails until the ' Descriptions of thirteen new species of land-shells from Formosa, in the collection of the late Hugh Cuming, collected bv Mr. Robert Swinhoe, Vice-Consul of that island.

No localities are given for the species described in this paper, but we know from a letter from Swinhoe published in P. Z. S., for 1864 that these shells were chiefly from Tamsui in northern Formosa, a few from Takow in the south.

721 end of the next decade, when Surgeon-General R. Hungerford, Ritter von Fries and a few other naturahsts visited the island.
Their collections were worked up chiefly by Dr. O. von Mollendorff, who published the results in his enlightening series of papers upon the Chinese snail fauna.
* Meantime the Melaniidce collected by IMr.
Dickson had been described by Mr. E. A. Smith .^ After von Mollendorff 's departure for Manila the field was left to Mr. B. Schmacker, then of Hongkong, whose material was obtained in part from several German friends who travelled in Formosa, but largely by his Japanese collector who spent over three months there in the latter part of 1889.
The materials gathered were ably worked up by Schmacker and Boettger.^ From 1891 until this time, only a few inconsiderable additions have been made to the list of Formosan mollusks.
The data for the principal papers may be tabulated thus: Authors.

The specimens taken by Mr. Okura are not quite elevated enough to be typical.
Mr, E. A. Smith incidentally reports C. exaltatus from Formosa (P. Z. S., 1887, 318).
It is a well-known Hongkong species, and in view of the excessively critical nature of the species of Cyclophorus of the Sino-insular group, the specimens referred by Smith to exaltatus may belong to C. formosaensis.
Some forms given the rank of species in the exaltatus group by von Moellendorff and others are distinguished by only slight and elusive characters.

Cyclotus minutus concentratus n. subsp.
Shell reddish-brown or pale olive-green with a brown spire, closely sculptured with fine spiral threads (closer than in C. minutus) on a glossy ground, except for a band below the suture (both on the spire and within the umbilicus), which is covered with narrow whitish cuticular rays.
Whorls 3|, tubular, the last barely in contact at the mouth.

Cyathopoma taiwanicum n. sp.
Shell umbilicate, conic, corneous, somewhat translucent.
Whorls 3^, the first smooth, dark corneous, the rest spirally lirate, very convex, the penultimate with four or five thread-like spirals.
Last whorl tubular, the threads weaker on its later part, much stronger around and in the umbilicus.
Aperture circular, the peristome thin, simple, barely in contact with the preceding whorl.
Operculum lodged at the aperture, white, concave externally, usually with a dark dot at the center.

The genus Cyathopoma is not yet .known from China.
Its eastern limit has hitherto been the Khasi, Naga and South Garo Hills, where the species are like the Formosan in featm^es of the operculum.
It has not been found north of these places, nor eastward in the Dafla Hills, so that its known range heretofore has been sub-Himalayan and southward.
In this and other known Formosan and Japanese Cyathopomas, the shell has no fibrous vertically striated coating, such as is conspicuous in the Indian C. filocinctum and others.
The whorls of the operculum have no projecting lamellae.
The species belong therefore to the subgenus Jerdonia, as defined by Kobelt (Das Thierrcich, Cyclophoriden, p. 219).
It is clear, however, that Kobelt ignores the character of the operculum in his distribution of the species of Cyathopoma and Jerdonia.
C. taiivanicum is not unlike C. album Bedd., but it has more spirals, and they are not so prominent in the umbilicus.
There is a form of C. taiwanicum from Chosokei which is a little more variable in sculpture than the type lot, sometimes having one or two more spiral threads.
Cyathopoma taiwanicum degeneratum n. subsp.
At Suganiikei, Taiwan, five specimens were taken which differ from C. taiwanicum by the degeneration of the spiral threads, which are very weak or even almost wanting on the last whorl.
T3'pes are No.

Mr. Ancey has proposed a genus Nakadiella for Cyclotus (?)
micron; but this species differs from typical forms of Jerdonia in nothing but the absence of spiral striation.
There are a number of equalty smooth species in Ceylon.
Nakadiella may be retained as a sectional name for the smooth forms, if the distinction proves to be natural; otherwise it will become a synonym of Jerdonia.

This species varies a good deal in size and structure of the hp, but Schmacker and Boettger seem to be right in hokling that all the described Formosan forms are but varying races of one species.
The specimens from Hotawa are about typical, length 13 mm.
Those from Anshiryosan seem referable to the race tnorrisonia H.
Ad., described from Mt.
Morrison.
They are 10.5-11 mm.
long, and have the upper funnel of the lip much smaller than in the type.
At Suganiikei there is also a small form of about the same length.

Dr. von Moellendorff considered this a variety of the Chinese D. paxillus Gredler; but its differential features seem constant, Diplommatina taiwanica n. sp.
Shell imperforate, the lower half cylindric, upper half conic, light orange colored, darker toward the apex.
Whorls 6^, the first 4+ regularly increasing, the next whorl larger, swollen, the last whorl much smaller, especially as seen in a dorsal view.
First H whorls smooth, the next 3^ sculptured with delicate thread-like riblets which become a little closer on the front of the swoUen penultimate whorl, and then become more or less obsolete, so that the last whorl or whorl and a half are nearly or quite smooth.
Constriction median above the aperture.
Palatal plica short, partly under the parietal callus.
Aperture vertical, irregularly rounded, the columellar margin straightened.
Peristome well expanded and somewhat thickened, angular at the junction of the columellar and basal margins; parietal callus rather small, its border usually indistinct.

In D. hungerjordiana the cone of the spire is shorter.
Another set of specimens from Giiran differs in having the last two whorls striate throughout, the strise closer than on the conical upper portion of the spire.
This may be only individual variation.
Eleven of the entirely striate and fifteen of the typical specimens were taken.
Siplommatina taiwanica suganiikeiensis n. subsp.

Diplommatina camara n. sp.
Shell imperforate, cylindric below, conic above, pale orange or brownish-yellow.
Whorls 6, the first 4 regularly increasing, the next whorl swollen, the last much smaller, especially as seen dorsally.
First H whorls smooth; following whorls of the cone sculptured with widely spaced thread-like riblets, penultimate whorl with the riblets much closer, last whorl smooth.
Constriction rather deep, median above the mouth .

This species differs from D. taiwanica, chiefly by its very small palatal plica and the very short columellar lamella, which in taiwanica ascends to the constriction.
D. tokunoshimana differs from camura in sculpture and the well-developed palatal plica.
Diplommatina prava n. sp.
Shell cylindric below, conic above, imperforate, pale yellowish corneous, the upper whorls often orange tinted.
Whorls 6|, regularly increasing to the penultimate, which is wider but not especially swollen; last whorl scarcely smaller, its last third making a long ascent to the aperture.
Sculpture of weak rather close and very fine threadlike strise.
Constriction distinct, situated near or at the end of the penultimate whorl, behind the lip.
Aperture irregularly rounded, the columellar side straight.
Parietal callus small.
Peristome expanded and thickened or duplicated, the outer lip, in profile, seen to be a little retracted or concave in the middle, projecting in a blunt point a short distance from the upper insertion ; an angle outside at the junction of the columellar and basal margins.

It resembles D. luchvana somewhat, but differs in the position of the constriction, stronger basal angle, less distinct parietal callus, etc.
It occurred in some numbers {pravus, deformed).
Slightly smaller specimens were taken at Suganiikei.
At Hotawa the sculpture is better developed.
Falaina formosana n. sp.
Shell sinistral, minute, pupiform, imperforate, yellow or pale brownish-yellow, sculptured with delicate, distant, thread-like very oblique riblets, about 7 in number on the last whorl, absent on the front of this whorl, and verj^ weak on the penultimate whorl.
Whorls 5, convex, the first three regularly and rapidly increasing, the penultimate very much swollen, predominating, the last whorl smaller, rapidly tapering to the base, slightly constricted immediately above the aperture.
Suture well impressed , quite oblique.

Compared with typical lautsi, this form differs in the small size, wider mouth as seen in front view, and narrower last whorl as seen from above, and it wants a white edge on the keel.
A small form of lautsi has been recorded by Schmacker and Boettger from Takao.
The subordination of lautsi to H. shermani Pfr.
in Schmacker and Boettger's second discussion of it was apparently an error, H. shermani being a Trocliomorpha.
Eulota (Plectotropis) inrinensis n. sp.
The shell is depressed-trochiform, thin, umbilicate, the umbilicus narrow, less than one-fifth the diameter of the shell, rapidly contracting within; pale brownish-corneous, lusterless, lightly striatulate, and finely striate spirally, the spirals very delicate, scarcely visible above, more distinct below.
Spire low-conic, with nearly straight outlines.
Whorls 5j to 5^, somewhat convex, the last acutely carinate at the periphery, convex below, slightly descending in front.

The spire is conic, with straight lateral outlines.
Whorls 6^, slowly increasing, but slightly convex, the last with a slightly projecting, acute keel at the peripher}^ descending slightly below the keel to the aperture.
Suture well impressed, following the lower edge of the keel.
Aperture oblique, peristome thin, the basal and outer margins narrowly reflexed, arcuate, the upper margin but slightly arcuate, hardly expanded, columellar margin nearly vertical, arcuate, dilated above; parietal callus very thin.

from Tainan (Tainan-fu or Taiwan-fu), and Bankimtsong is directly east of Takao (Takow), The orthography of Formosan place-names is in a state of transition, owing to the change of ownership of the island and the diverse phonetics of Chinese and Japanese; the older mode being the Chinese, the newer Japanese.
Thus, Keelimg of ordinary maps is Kiirun in the Japanese mode.

In compliance with the recommendation of the Committee on the Hayden Memorial Geological Award, the medal for 1905 was conferred by unanimous vote on Charles Doolittle Walcott, LL.D., Director of the United States Geological Survey.
Charles Doolittle Walcott was born in New York Mills, New York, the thirty-first of March, 1850.
He was educated in the schools of Utica, New York.
On leaving school he entered a large hardware establishment, but after a year and a half decided to pursue geological investigations.
He located north of Utica, and for five years studied by himself, and w^orked in the field.
In 1876 he received an appointment under Professor James Hall, State Geologist of New York, remaining there until 1879, when he received an appointment as Field Assistant on the United States Geological Survey.
He became successively Assistant Paleontologist, Chief Paleontologist, Geologist in Charge of Geology, and, July 1, 1894, Director of the Survey.
He began publishing paleontological papers in 1875, and in 1879 published his first geological and paleontological memoir, on the "Utica Slate and Related Formations."
Since that time numerous papers on geological and paleontological topics have appeared, the most extended of which are "The Paleontology of the Eureka Dis49 trict," 1884; ''Cambrian Faunas of North America/' 1885 and 1886; "The Famia of the Lower Cambrian, or Olenellus, Zone," 1890; "Correlation of Cambrian Formations/' 1891; "Algonkian Rocks of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado/' 1895.
Honorary Curator, Department of Paleontology of the U. S. National Museum, 1892-1897, and since 1898; from January, 1897, to July, 1898, at head of U. S. National Museum, with title of Acting Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution ; Secretary of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1902, and since.

Behavior of Sea Anernones.
— Dr. H. S. Jennings gave an account of studies on the behavior of sea anemones, made at the Tortugas Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution.
Special attention was given to the modifiability of behavior.
The speaker showed that these low organisms by no means always react in the same way to the same external conditions.
On the contrary, their reactions are modifiable from a variety of causes.
Changes in the internal physiological ])rocesses, former stimuli that have affected the animal, former reactions performed by the animal, and a number of other factors, all assist in determining the present action of the organism.
There is a clearly marked tendency, in some cases, to repeat an action in the w^ay it has been performed before.
These various factors give a high degree of complexity and adaptiveness to the behavior of even these low animals.
C. H. Smyth, Jr., was elected a member.
