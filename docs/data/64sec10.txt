A CATALOGUE OF JAPANESE CEPHALOPODA.
by s. stillman berry.
Introduction.
While engaged in a somewhat comprehensive study of the Cephalopod fauna of the Hawaiian Islands, the writer found himself impelled to consider the possibility of correlation with that of other regions of the Pacific, notably Japan, whence so many bizarre and interesting types have been described.
In pursuance of this a simple catalogue was first compiled, then a fairly detailed list of references added, and finally, when the collections of Stanford University proved to be surprisingly rich in material from this region, a mass of other data was accumulated.
The greater part of all this is now offered' in the present paper.
The aim is merely to present a bibliographic catalogue of all the cephalopod mollusks known to occur within the waters of the Japanese Empire, with the addition of a few more or less pertinent notes regarding such species as have chanced to come under the personal observation of the writer.
As already indicated, the bulk of this material was furnished by the zoological collections of Stanford University, where it owes its origin chiefly to the Jordan and Snyder Expedition to Japan in 1900.
As the purpose of this expedition was mainly ichthyological, no special effort was made to secure a large collection of cephalopods, but the species which were incidentally obtained are fairly numerous and frequently of considerable interest.
In addition to the above, mention should be made of a small series of cephalopods secured by Dr. David Starr Jordan at Fusan, Korea, in 1911, and a few taken at Takao, Formosa, by Mr. Hans Sauter, which are likewise in the Stanford University collections.
Through the courtesy of Mr. Samuel Henshaw, I have also had the privilege of examining a large series of Euprymna from Hong Kong in the Museum of Comparative Zoology.
Lastly, but very fortunately, I have been enabled, through the signal kindness of Prof. A. E. Verrill, to secure the loan of an inextensive but unusually interesting series of small squids, including cotypes of two important species, taken many years ago by Prof. E. S. Morse in the Bay of Tokio (Yecldo), and now preserved in the Yale University Museum.
Historical Survey.
With the possible exception of Tilesius.
the honor of being the first author who attempts to refer taxonomically to any Japanese cephalopod belongs, so far as I have been able to ascertain, to Alcide d'Orbigny, who, in the great Histoire produced during the years 1834-1839 in collaboration with Ferussac, attributed the followingnamed forms to this region: Octopus Fa ng-sia o .
Sepiola japon ica .
Octopus areolatus.
Sepioteuthis sinensis.
Octopus sinensis.
Sepia sinensis.
Loligopsis chrysophtalmos.
As the majority of these nominal species were based upon the rude drawings or descriptions of other authors and hence, as a rule, are quite unaccompanied by accurate definition, only the Octopus areolatus appears capable of precise determination.
All of the other names, with the doubtful exception of Sepiola japonica, have dropped from use.
Following the activity of d'Orbigny, we find a long period covering the decades from 1845 to 1885 when but little in regard to this particular field found its way into print save a few exceedingly scattered and fragmentary observations by such authors as Lischke (1869), Try on (1879), Steenstrup (Sepia andreana 1875, Todarodes pacificus 1880), Hilgendorf (Architeuthis martensii 1880), Owen (1881), and Verrill (Inioteuthis japonica and morsei 1881).
In the years 1885 and 1886, however, occurred the successive publication bj^ Dr. William E. Hoyle of the important results attained by his exhaustive study of the cephalopods taken during the cruise of H. M. S.
"Challenger."
In a resume of the Cephalopoda of the region under consideration (1886, p. 219) some 25 species (one of them doubtful and another since eliminated) belonging to 8 genera are listed.
The species added to the fauna include the type of a new genus, 8 other new forms, and several others previously described from other regions, as follows: Octopus hongkongensis.
Sepia myrsus ?
Octopus januarii.
Sepia esculenta.
Promachoteuthis megaptera.
Sepia kobiensis.
Loligo edulis.
S< pia andreauoides.
Loligo kobiensis.
Sepiella maindroni.
Loligo japonica.
Calliteuthis ocellata (as C. reversa).
In the meanwhile appeared an important paper by Appellof (Japanska Cephalopoder, Stockholm, 1886), which is significant as being the first time that we find the cephalopods of Japan dealt with as an assembled unit by themselves.
In this paper 8 species were added: Octopus vulgaris.
Loligo bleekeri.
Octopus globosits n. s. Loligo swnatrensis.
Octopus macropus.
Sepia peterseni n. s. S( pioteuthis lessoniana.
Sepia ( = Metasepia) tullbergi n. s. Two years later the publication of a second treatise on the same subject from the pen of Dr. A. E. Ortmann (Japanische Cephalopoden, Zool.
Jahrb., 1888) marked another notable increase in our knowledge.
Thirty-six species referable to 10 genera are accredited to our area, of which the following are first recorded: Tremoctopus doderleini n. s. Loligo tetradynamia n. s. ( = Ocythoe tuberculatd) Loligo chinensis.
Octopus kagoshimensis n. s. Loligo aspera n. s. Octopus pusillus.
Sepia hoylei n. s. Microteuthis paradoxa n. s. Sepia torosa n. s. ( = Idiosepius).
Sepia tokioensis n. s. During the next twenty years succeeded another period of only occasional short papers and desultory notes, the most important of which are those of Pilsbry (Sepia hercules, 1894), Ijima and Ikeda (Opisthoteuthis depressa 1895, Amphitretus pelagicus and Alloposus pacificus 1902), Mitsukuri and Ikeda (1898), Joubin (1897, 1898), Pfeffer (1900), Nishikawa (1906), Meyer (1906), and Chun (1908, 1910).
Very recently Wulker (1910) has published a third survey of the Japanese members of the group, based upon a portion of the valuable material brought to Germany by Dr. Doflein.
In this work, notable for its numerous interesting data and the able manner in which they are presented, Japan is accredited with no less than 24 genera comprising an even 60 species (3 of them doubtful).
The following are additions to the fauna: Tremoctopus violaceus.
Sepia elliptica.
Polypus doflein i n. s. Sepia lorigera n. s. Polypus pictus fasciatus.
Sepia misakiensis n. s. Sepia aculeata.
Sepia appellofi n. s. Symphctoteuthis oualaniensis.
the present catalogue the recognized number is increased to eies I I considered doubtful), falling under 29 genera, with one somewhat doubtful subspecies.
But one new species (Sepia formosana) is here proposed, although two others, Stoloteuthis nipponensis and Abraliopsis scintillans (Berry 1911, 1911a), have previously been described from the same material and are now more fully characterized and figured.
Relationships and Distribution.
After the excellent discussion of the relationships of the Japanese cephalopod fauna by Wtilker (1910, pp.
23, 24), it would be idle to reenter into the subject with much detail here.
Suffice to say that the close analogy there dwelt upon between many Japanese and Mediterranean types is now still further heightened by the addition of Thelidioteuthis alessandrinii to the list.
Nevertheless, the predominant tone of the fauna is quite decidedly Indo-Malayan.
Indeed, outside of the genera Loligo and Sepia, astonishingly few species are known to be exclusively Japanese, though these two groups here attain such an abundant development and comprise so many unique species that the gross aspect of any large collection from the region is quite characteristic.
The presence of the hongkongensis group of Polypi appears somewhat anomalous and may indicate that these species are invaders from the Aleutian-Californian fauna, where they or their near allies form one of the most strikingelements, a conclusion which is, however, by no means to be regarded as certain.
These points are brought out somewhat more forcibly by statement in tabular form.
The distribution of the fauna, according to groups, is significantly shown in the following table : » Genera.
octopoda 7 Myopsida 1 1 (Egopsida^.
1 1 Tetrabranchiata 1 Species.
Sub-species.
Doubtful 20 1 ?
2 35 2 12 1 Total .30 68 1 ?
4 The most striking feature is very obviously the great preponderance of the Myopsida which comprise more species, or at least as many, as all other groups combined.
This again is almost entirely due to the more abundant representation of Loligo and Sepia, and is quite the reverse of the conditions prevailing in other areas of the North Pacific.
Despite the enormous number of recognized species and the fact t hat no other region of the Pacific has been so diligently investigated, our understanding of the fauna is still so incomplete that this catalogue can scarcely be regarded as any less provisional in nature than its predecessors.
As yet we know almost nothing regarding the distribution of this class of animals along the coasts of northwestern Japan and in the Japan Sea, and but little collecting has been done anywhere on the island of Hokkaido.
As is to be expected, the neighboring bays of Tokio, Sagami, and Suruga afford us with the bulk of our information, and the vicinity of Misaki has proven a particularly prolific locality.

The reported dispersal of the species is somewhat peculiar and indicates that it will eventually prove to be nearly cosmopolitan.

Family POLYPODID^E Hoyle, 1904.
Genus POLYPUS Schneider, 1784.
That the genus Polypus attains an especially large development on the coasts of Japan is attested by the formidable list of names which have at one time or another been ascribed to this area, and that despite the fact that, so far as members of this group are concerned, the deeper waters off shore are still practically a terra incognita.
P. januarii being the only abyssal species thus far reported.
However, the true number belonging to the fauna is somewhat obscured by the lack of sufficient diagnosis or other needful information respecting several of the alleged species.
The following list is thought to include all the names which occur in the literature: Polypus vulgaris Lamarck.
P. hongkongensis Hoyle.
P. granulatus Lamarck ( =rugoP. dofleini Wulker.

P. pictus fasciatus Hoyle.

As I have had no European specimens of P. vulgaris available for comparison, I cannot feel personally certain that the followingspecimens are correctly referred to this species, but I think little doubt exists that they are conspecific with the form so identified 1 Octopus Fang-siao and Octopus sinensis are names applied by d'Orbigny to certain rude illustrations of Chinese or Japanese origin and published by him without any real diagnosis.
They arc nearly or quite unrecognizable and probably can never have any standing.
Appellof has suggested that O. Fang-siao belongs to the synonymy of O. ocellatus.
Tryon refers O. sinensis without hesitation to O. membranaceus, Hoyte somewhat dubiously unites it with O. areolatus, while Appellof places it with a query under O. vulgaris.

The fact that the lateral arms are usually notably longer than the others, the minute conical hectocotylus, reticulate surface, and reddishgray color seem to be very characteristic.
The lateral arms in the male show a conspicuous enlargement of one or (occasionally) more of the suckers near the umbrella margin, as has been noted in numerous other species.

The identity and important characters of this species are scarcely yet established upon a firm basis, for it seems to me questionable whether the Western Pacific specimens referred by Hoyle (1904) to P. pusillus are really conspecific with Gould's type.
The relatively wide umbrella (one fourth as long as the arms) arm formula 1, 2, 3, 4, lack of cirri, smooth skin, and large, prominent eyes appear to be the most salient features noted in Gould's description.

The loose, soft, elongate body; long, attenuate, and very unequal arms; short umbrella; curiously formed hectocotylus, and nearly smooth surface serve to distinguish P. macropus from any of its Japanese congeners.
The arms of the various pairs are conspicuously different in proportion, their order persistently 1, 2, 3, 4, and the dorsal pair much the stoutest and longest.
The right third arm of the cf is scarcely half as long as its mate of the opposite side and terminates in an extremely conspicuous, oblong, trough-shaped hectocotylus, ornamented with perhaps 8 or 9 prominent transverse ridges on its inner surface and so thickened as to greatly exceed the adjacent portion of the arm in diameter.
The skin is in general smooth, but the present material shows usually about three small conical tubercles just above and behind each eye-opening, with a few scattered smaller ones occasionally apparent over the rest of the dorsum.
The more important measurements of two specimens are given below, both being males: 390 [July Length, total I ,ength of mantle, dorsal Width of mantle Width of neck Width of head Length of funnel 1 .rugth of right dorsal arm (outside measurement).

Wulker cites the enormous elongate hectocotylus (^ or more the length of the arm) and the very long arms (7 times the ventral mantle length) as perhaps the most conspicuous features which may be depended upon to distinguish this very distinct species.
I am not at all convinced that the Eastern Asiatic species is really identical with the O. punctatus Gabb of California, although without doubt they are very closely related.

; one or two larger ones over each eye; smooth below.
Arms moderate, subequal, evenly tapering, about three times as long as the head and body, their order 3 = 2, 4, 1.
Suckers large, crowded; one or two of those just inside the web margin on the lateral arms a little larger than the rest, but not abruptly or conspicuously so.
Hectocotylized arm scarcely at all shorter than its mate of the opposite side; the terminal organ very small, smooth, elongate, spoon-shaped.
Umbrella short, about equally developed all around.

The status of this species is still very uncertain as it is not quite apparent whether the Octopus ocellatus Gray is the same as the Chinese drawing to which the same name was previously applied by d'Orbigny, or whether the 0. ocellatus Appellof is in turn identical with that of Gray.
Tryon refers Gray's species to 0. membranaceus, while Hoyle places 0. ocellatus of both Gray and Appellof in the synonymy of 0. areolatus.
However, Appellof's determination has been called in question by Brock.
Wulker, the most recent writer on the subject, lists the species as P. ocellatus Gray.

P. areolatus is a small species with a compact, pyriform body, widest posteriorly, and with a conspicuous ventral furrow.
The head is small and weakly differentiated from the body.
The dorsal 26 394 [July, surface is quite heavily and evenly papillose with either (1) soft polygonal tubercles, or (2) almost a shagreen of small stellate warts, or (3) fairly smooth when poorly preserved.
Ventrally the papillae become nearly obsolete.
A group of two large and several smaller papillae surmounts either eye.
The arms are almost of a length, the second pair slightly longer than the others, but not much more than twice as long as the head and body taken together.
They taper evenly to slender extremities.
In the male the third right arm is only a little shorter than its mate.
The very ample marginal canal is transversely striate within and terminates in a faint groove running down the inner face of the small naked elongate-conical hectocotylus.
One sucker of the fifth or sixth pairs on each lateral arm shows a conspicuous enlargement.
The color of preserved specimens is a dark slaty-brown, paler below and on the inner surface of the umbrella.

of and below the eye on either side is a conspicuous eye-like spot, comprising a dark outer ring enclosing within it a narrower ring of a lighter color (usually bluish and showing a faint metallic lustre), and within this a central zone of the same dark shade as the outer ring.
There is also a definable but less conspicuous ovoid spot between the eyes of a lighter and browner tint than the general surface.
The ocular markings of the six specimens in the Stanford University collection seem much larger than those of the animal figured by Hoyle in the Challenger Report, but I have no doubt b that they are correctly referred to the same species.

Wulker considers part of these characters due to the preservation and suggests that the remainder are equally applicable to P. areolatus.
The present specimens bear out this opinion very fairly.

2,017 A specimen entered as L. S. J. U., Cat, 2,018 (S. S. B.

332], collected by Jordan and Snyder at Tsuruga, Echizen, is not only much larger than any of the specimens above referred to P. areolatus, but differs from them so conspicuously in several quite important characters that I feel considerable uncertainty as to whether it is specifically identical with them.
There is a large irregular tubercle over each eye, but except for this the skin is almost perfectly smooth.
At various points on the dorsal surface, however, are to be observed a few small scattered pit-like indentations resembling impressed papilla?, most conspicuous being a diamond-shaped group of four on the middle of the back.
The arms are about three and a half times as long as the head and body and very unequal, though this appears to be clue to the fact that many of them have been mutilated and are undergoing regeneration.
The enlarged suckers and hectocotylus are similar to those just described for P. areolatus.
The color is exceedingly dark and the heavy pigmentation extends over even the inner surfaces of the aims and periphery of the suckers, so that the pale inner surfaces of the latter stand out very conspicuously against the slate-colored background.
The ocular markings are nearly circular, and the inner light colored ring is nearly as wide as the one enclosing it.
There are also traces of another light colored zone or ring outside the latter.
The inmost dark core is conspicuously smaller than in the specimens described above.

1.
This small and curious species, although admittedly showing close affinity to L. japonica, was differentiated by Ortmann on* the following grounds : 1.
The suckers of the lateral arms are very much larger than those of the dorsal and ventral pairs, a condition prevailing equally in both sexes.
2.
There are no suckers upon the buccal membrane.
3.
The arms of the third pair do not possess a membranous keel.
4.
The structure of the hectocotylus is different.
Viewed casually, these features appear sufficiently diagnostic.
Nevertheless, an examination of the large series of.
specimens before me causes me to incline very strongly to the opinion that L. tetradynamia will eventually prove to be entirely synonymous with L. japonica, although the differences apparent in the descriptions of the hectocotylized arms and one or two other less important divergencies deter me at present from uniting them.
In this regard a comparison of the respective type specimens with one another would certainly prove of the utmost service.
The present specimens appear to belong beyond dispute to L. tetradynamia, and yet in several particulars Ortmann's diagnosis is not quite sufficient 'to embrace them.
The hectocotylus is as described by Ortmann.
Likewise the suckers of the lateral arms are invariably of conspicuously greater size than those of the dorsal and ventral pairs.
However, this statement is decidedly not true of both sexes in equal degree, since in all the males I have seen the suckers of the lateral arms are at least half again as large as those of a female of the same size.
Other differences to be noted are that the horny rings of the larger tentacular suckers are toothed all round, not alone upon the distal border, with some 23-25 blunt teeth, and that the arms of the third pair are possessed of a decided keel.
Indeed, the females accord suspiciously well* with the specimen of japonica taken by the Challenger Expedition in the Yokohama Market.
The chief points of difference are that here the dorsal arms are distinctly keeled instead of rounded, as stated by Hoyle, and he makes no mention of the great disparity in the size of the suckers, although his phrase "and vary in size in accordance with the arms on which they are situated" may amount to the same thing.
Comparison with his excellent figure distinctly fortifies the latter interpretation.
Likewise the tentacles are compressed and angular rather than cylindrical, and I have discovered no suckers on the buccal membrane, though I do not regard this observation as proving their absence there.
These items of difference, however, seem to be very minor, and were it not for Hoyle's careful description of the curious hectocotylized arm of a male in the Copenhagen Museum which he held to be eonspecific with his type, there could be little hesitation in relegating L. tetradynamia to the synonymy.

Body elongate, massive, dorso-ventrally compressed; contour elongate ovoid, tapering rapidly to a blunt point behind.
Mantle very thick and heavy; its anterior margin free, produced forward to a rounded point in the nuchal region, and similarly, but to a much less degree, ventrally; broadly emarginate below the funnel.
Fins large; attached along the entire length of the mantle, which they slightly exceed both in front and behind in the specimen furnishing the description (a cf from Wakanoura), though not in the others.
Cartilaginous articulations as usual in the genus, large and very prominent.
Head of moderate size, squarish.
Eyes large and prominent.
In front of the orbit is a large pore ; behind it the integument is raised into a very prominent crest, bilobate, curved, and somewhat excavated in front, with the "olfactory" pore shelteredjust below its dorsal margin.
Funnel very large, very wide at the base and tapering bluntly to a rounded extremity; aperture large and directed downward, with well-developed lips and valve; supported above by a fleshy bridle at the base of the funnel groove.
Arms of moderate length, stout, squarish, unequal; the order of length not constant, but in my best specimens 3, 4, 2, 1 .
All the arms are outwardly keeled and provided with a broad marginal membrane supported by numerous transverse fleshy processes having their origin between the bases of the sucker pedicels.
The latter is best developed on the third pair and least on the ventral arms.
The keel, however, attains its maximum on the ventral arms, where it is developed as a broad, thickened web ensheathing the base of the tentacles.
These arms are also furnished with a second less prominent keel running down their inner margins.
Suckers large, regularly alternating in two rows on all the arms; horny rings prominent, armed with about 18 to 22 stout acute, curved teeth.
The hectocotylization affects the left ventral arm of the male after the fashion usual in this genus and in Loligo.
The first 19 pairs of suckers are normal ; they then become much reduced, and after the 24th pair are supplanted by stout conical papilla?.
On the first four or five papilla?
the suckers persist, though in a very rudimentary way, but soon become entirely obsolete.
• The integument on and between the papilla?
of the Wakanoura specimen is much folded and lobed, a condition perhaps due to the action of the preservative.
Tentacles rather short, laterally much compressed and keeled on both outer and inner margins.
The outer keel becomes expanded i a broad fleshy web along the distal portion of the club.
The soon becomes obsolete and is succeeded by an abruptly differentiated flattened area, where the integument is finely and irregularly plicate.
Club large, comprising nearly half the length of the tentacle, and provided with a broad trabeculate marginal membrane similar to that of the sessile arms.
Suckers in four rows, large near the middle, diminishing in size toward either end, distally becoming very minute, and showing the spoon-shaped arrangement at the tip described by Goodrich (1896, p. 6) and Hoyle (1904, p. 31) for related species; horny rings with 18-20 stout, acute, incurved teeth.
Buccal membrane seven-pointed, bearing from three to five minute suckers on each lappet.
The suckers are pedunculate and have horny rings.
Gladius lanceolate; the lateral thickenings diverging from the thick midrib extend along the middle of the wings for the posterior two-thirds of their length (PI.

Color of preserved specimens brownish-buff, heavily reticulated above with purplish-black, lighter below, and with the ventral surfaces of the fins unmarked.

As the original figures of d'Orbigny and Ferussac have not been accessible to me, I have not referred the specimens in hand to this species without a certain amount of hesitation, and hence have thought it well to enter somewhat fully into the details of their description.
Few of the species of Sepioteuthis have been as well characterized in the literature as they should be, but I have little doubt that the present material is at least identical with that from the same region which authors before me have identified as S. lessoniana.
The species is said to attain a length of three feet, but the maximum dimension given by Hoyle in respect to the specimens taken by the "Challenger" is only 570 mm.
If correctly understood, this form would seem to have a surprising range in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific, and possibly several other nominal species should be relegated to the synonymy.

The species Sepiola japonica was published by d'Orbigny from a manuscript letter of Tilesius and I cannot find that any specimens were seen by d'Orbigny himself.
Gray (1849) copied his diagnosis from d'Orbigny, but expressed some doubt as to its proper reference to Sepiola.
Then except for a brief mention in Tryon's " Manual" (1879) we find it otherwise unnoticed for over thirty years.
Finally a small collection of squids obtained by Prof. E. S. Morse in the Bay of Tokio was sent by him to Prof. A. E. Verrill, then engaged with his report on "The Cephalopods of the Northeastern Coast. "
These specimens furnished the descriptions of two species which were accordingly published in the appendix of this report as a footnote (1881, p. 417), and the genus Inioteuthis was erected to receive them.
The form now under consideration was expressly made the type 4 and identified with the Sepiola Japonica of d'Orbigny, although upon exactly what grounds other than general probability does not seem to be entirely clear.
A great many points yet remain to be cleared up, and, as I have been able through the kindness of Prof. Yerrill himself to secure the use of the majority of his specimens, they have been made the basis of the more extended description of the species given herewith: Body short and saccular; mantle in the male somewhat ..bellshaped, widest in front, tapering rapidly to a rounded posterior extremity; in the adult female more rounded and cylindrical, less tapering, and relatively much more plump.
Nuchal commissure rather wide, but considerably narrower than in Euprymim morsei.
Mantle margin usually, but not ahvays, more or less emarginate beneath, permitting the siphon a greater freedom of movement.
Fins thin, small, subcircular, forming a lobe in front; attachment narrow, considerably above the median horizontal plane of the body; position with regard to the mantle almost median in the adult, but in the young placed much further back.
Head oblong, flattened above; width inclusive of the eyes about twice the length.
Funnel long, tapering, rather slender.
Lockingapparatus comprising an oblong groove on either side of the base of the funnel and folds to correspond on the inner surface of the mantle.
The grooves are provided with a thickened reflexed margin.
The folds are simple narrow ridges, much longer than the grooves.
Eyes of moderate size; openings small.
"Olfactory organ" situated considerably below and behind the lid opening.
Arms short, fleshy, but fairly slender; the first pair the shortest and smallest, the rest subequal; third pair obscurely carinate, stouter and somewhat longer than the others.
A poorly developed web connects the arms at the base, but is obsolete or wanting between the ventral pair.
Suckers in two alternating rows; in the female very minute and alike on all the arms; somewhat modified in the male.
Left dorsal arm of the male very conspicuously hectocotylized ; at its extreme base appear one or two very minute and rudimentary suckers, these immediately succeeded by a huge ridge-like swelling, irregularly oval in shape and somewhat suggestive of the concha of the human ear; this curious organ extends about half way up the arm and is apparently formed by the fusion of exceedingly modified obscured sucker pedicels, though it bears no suckers.
The he structure given by Ortmann is recognizable, but scarcely species, /.
morsei, has since become the type of Steenstrup's genus .
Euprymna.
more.
The distal half of the arm is sucker bearing, but on the specimen in hand only the pedicels remain.
The right dorsal arm is essentially like that of the 9 except that the suckers along its central portion are very much larger than the rest and hence fewer in number.
The same peculiarity is true of the outer row of suckers on the second pair of arms of the d 7 " and to a much less degree of the ventral arms.
The suckers of the third-arm pair are very minute and relatively very widely spaced.
Individual suckers of the sessile arms nearly spherical, with very small apertures and smooth horny rings.
They break off with such ease that few of my specimens retain an average of more than two or three on each arm.
Tentacles slender, as long as the body, but when bent back not extending beyond the fins; tentacular club but little thickened, with a thin membrane along its inner margin, its inner surface villous; a microscopic examination shows the velvety appearance to be due to the exceeding minuteness of the suckers which clothe it; the latter long pediceled and closely placed in about eight rows.
Individual suckers bell-shaped, the wide openings surrounded by a papillary area, outside of which is a thin, broad, outwardly flaring, striate membrane; horny rings well developed, seemingly armed with twenty or more distinct acute teeth, but it is not outside the range of possibility that the apparent teeth may be merely very large papilla?
or chitinous projections from the papillary border.
Beak and radula not examined.
Gladius none.
Color when living not observed; in alcohol a pale yellowish-brown, the chromatophores appearing as bluish-black spots, quite small and distinct on the mantle, larger and more run together on the head.

2,020 Since the establishment of the genus and the elimination of Euprymna morsei, Inioteuthis has been enriched by the addition of but one other species, the J. maculosa Goodrich 1896.
In the meanwhile the actual status of the group has been the occasion of considerable discussion.
Unquestionably, the most important known difference separating Inioteuthis from Sepiola is the absence of a^ gladius in the former, the generic significance of which feature in a case such as the present is certainly not yet fully established.
/.
maculosa does not seem to differ very strikingly from the Japanese species and further information regarding it would be very useful.
It has been reported from the Andaman Islands, Ceylon, and the Persian Gulf.

5 Animal small, sepiolif orm ; body short, thick, rounded, the lateral diameter on the average equal to about three-fourths of the length.
Fins large, semicircular, attached very obliquely inadvance of the middle of the body; broadest posteriorly; anterior ]obe conspicuous and abruptly notched at its inner margin so that the attached portion of the fin comprises but about the posterior twothirds of the total length.
Mantle margin projecting well forward ventrally, but with a deep, notch-like emargination just below and encompassing the funnel; united dorsally with the head by means of a very wide commissure, so that the opening of the mantle cavity attains only to a point just back of, and superior to, the eye opening on either side.
Head almost as broad as the body, the length somewhat exceeded by the width; flattened above; beneath slightly excavated for the reception of the funnel.
Eyes very large and prominent, somewhat swollen.
Funnel large, very elongate, but in the best preserved specimens not nearly reaching to the margin of the web between the ventral arms; tip with three heavy longitudinal ridges 6 on its interior surface, just back of which on the dorsal wall is a minute triangular valve; general surface of interior transversely ridged.
Funnel organ posterior in position, large, tripartite, comprising a broad triangular-hepatiform median pad on the dorsal wall and a pair 3 Verrill's original diagnosis (1881, p. 417, footnote) is* as follows: "Inioteuthis Morsei V., sp.

This is easily distinguished from the preceding [/.
japonica] by the presence of four crowded rows of suckers on all the arms; the suckers are attached by slender pedicles, which arise from the top of prominent, thickened, basal stems.
The tentacular clubs are well developed, with exceedingly numerous, very minute suckers, in more than sixteen rows.
Fins large, situated in advance of the middle of the body.
Dorsal and ventral arms about equal; two lateral pairs longer, the third pair slightly longer than the second.
Mantle edge, beneath, with a large emargination; dorsal commissure broad.
"No males of this species are in the collection; therefore I refer it to this genus only provisionally.
It has no pen."
I am inclined to consider these ridges a physiological modification attendant upon the conditions of preservation of the specimen furnishing the description.
of large elongate-pyriform cushions on the ventral wall; a narrow membranous ridge running down the centre of the median pad terminates anteriorly in a minute slender papilla.
Arms rather short, but the shortest ones usually at least as long as the mantle, the others somewhat longer; unequal, the order of relative length usually about 2, 3, 4 = l 7 ; dorsal (outer) margin of ventral arms carinate, the others rounded; outer surfaces smooth.
Umbrella lacking or at best rudimentary between the dorsal arms, better developed between the dorsal and second arms and between these and the third pair; between the third and fourth pairs it extends for over one-quarter of their length as a broad web ensheathing the base of the tentacles, becoming again much reduced or even obsolete between the ventral arms.
Suckers on all the arms closely crowded in four rows, except at the extreme base where they appear in two to three rows; obliquely poised on stout conical pedicels so that they are easily rubbed off, leaving the stumpy pedicels intact ; nearly spherical; apertures small, with smooth horny rings.
The above remarks I believe to be equally applicable to either sex, but in the detailed arrangement and appearance of the suckers a number of fairly conspicuous differences become evident.
In the 9 the suckers at corresponding parts of all the arms are subequal and exceedingly minute, their diameter little greater than that of the thickened bases of the pedicels.
In the d\ left ventral arm conspicuously hectocotylized; distinctly thicker and perhaps a little shorter than its mate; all the suckers nearly as small as in the 9 , the first two or three pairs in two to three rows, the remainder in four; about where the four-rowed condition commences, two components of the outermost (ventral) row become modified as a pair of elongate suckerless papillae; subsequent to this point ensue about six quartets of normal suckers reaching somewhat less than half way up the arm.
Here the suckers of the two ventral rows are succeeded by a single series of much enlarged, compressed, transversely elongate, tightly palisaded papillae of a very characteristic appearance, bearing the merest rudiments of suckers at their tips; these rudiments have mouth-like apertures, but do not have the appearance of mere lips afigured by Hoyle for E. stenodactyla, since close examination reveals the presence of well-developed though minute horny rings, their margins minutely but distinctly dentate with a number of acutely 7 Variations from this formula occur frequently in my material, but in this instance the majority of them seem due merely to poor preservation.
pointed triangular teeth.
The number of these papillae is about thirty, the largest occurring in the neighborhood of the tenth, thence gradually diminishing in size toward the tip.
The suckers of the dorsal rows maintain their arrangement in two series and there are about three more pairs of unmodified suckers than in the ventral row, but at this point they, too, become affected, their pedicels much swollen and puffed out, and the suckers themselves relatively much reduced, though not to quite so great a degree as in the ventral row.
The horny ring from one of these also shows minute teeth.
The right dorsal arm is longer, more slender, and more closely approximates the condition found in the 9 , but most of the suckers from the present specimens have been lost through abrasion, so there may have been minute differences now impossible to observe.
On the second arms most, if not all, of the suckers of both the two outermost rows are two to three times as large as those of the two median rows, except near the tip, where all are again subequal.
My specimens do not warrant the assertion that a similar condition prevails on the third pair, but it certainly reappears on the ventral arms and is here again nearly as conspicuous as on those of the second pair.
A large sucker taken from the latter is rotund, its base somewhat heartshaped; horny rings deep, smooth, but with a lateral indentation on each margin, above which a large, thin, hood-shaped expansion obstructs part of the aperture and destroys its otherwise nearly circular outline.
Tentacles stout, elastic, cylindrical; inner surface slightly flattened; half as long again as the body and more.
Clubs little expanded, keeled, tips recurved; inner face rounded, everywhere armed with exceedingly numerous and minute, long-stalked suckers, giving it a finely villous appearance.
Buccal membrane fleshy, pointed, rugose within.
Radula not examined.
Gladius wanting.
Color in alcohol a light brownish-buff; heavily maculated both above and below with numerous large dark slate-colored chromatophores, which are least numerous on the inner surfaces of the arms and the lower aspect of the fins.
On the under side of the latter over the area adjacent to the base of attachment they are absent.

285 nam Zool., Cat, 1,537 The material at my disposal referable to this species has been so unusual both in quantity and character, including even the original type specimens of Verrill, that despite the juvenility of the latter and the admittedly unfavorable preservation of the remainder L have thought it well to redescribe the species throughout as carefully and completely as the material would allow.
One of the types is likewise figured on Plate VI.
Some of the nearly allied species are most puzzlingly close, but it is hoped that the data here given will prove sufficient to prevent its confusion with any of them.
It must be confessed, however, that I have been unable to select any characters or combinations of characters which I am certain will suffice to distinguish a series consisting of females alone from any other species of the genus.
The males appear to be constantly characterized by the large number of modified suckers on the hectocotylized arm, coupled with the fact that the suckers of both the outer rows of the second, third, and fourth arms undergo enlargement, a character exceedingly conspicuous on the second arms at least and in well-preserved material probably on all.
Good descriptions have already been given by Appellof (1886), Hoyle (1886), Ortmann (1888), and of the anatomy by Wulker (1910).
Verrill's types are therefore made the basis of the above notes, with the exception of those portions relating to the d\ of which he had no specimens.
However, his specimens do not differ from the various larger females seen by me in any essential particulars except their dimensions.
This is the commonest Japanese Sepiolid and has been obtained by so many collectors that it must be a species of considerable abundance.
Specimens from Formosa do not seem different in any way, nor have I been able to separately identify the large series of individuals from Hong Kong in the Museum of Comparative Zoology.
The latter is also the type locality for Pfeffer's Sepiola bursa, and should not specimens in better preservation prove otherwise, there can be little doubt that this name is a complete synonym of E. morsei.

Body small, compact, short, plump, sepioliform, rounded behind.
Mantle attached to the head dorsally by a rather narrow commissure I L5 mm.
); free below and produced forward beneath the head, its edge sinuous and slightly emarginate in front, so as to expose the extreme tip of the funnel, otherwise entirely hidden.
Fins large, aicordate, the forward lobe extending from the anterior base of attachment as far as the mantle margin; posterior lobe scarcely developed; nearly median in position, the plane of attachment nearly level with the dorsal surface of the mantle.
Head very large, as broad as the body, flattened above, excavated beneath.
Eyes large with rather large openings; the right eyelid appears to be free all round, the left eye has only the lower lid free.
Funnel rather small, flexed upward so as to lie closely in the excavation formed by the hollowed under surface of the head.
A slight curved longitudinal groove with a raised and reflexed edge, situated on either side of the funnel quite far back, articulates with a corresponding ridge on the inner surface of the mantle; the ridge similarly curved, rather heavy, and notably longer than the groove.
"Olfactory organ" situated on the same level with the lower eyelid and just behind it.
Arms stout, thick, flesh}', and rather short, the order of length 2, 1, 3, 4, only the ventral arms noticeably shorter than the others; each with two rows of spherical short-pediceled suckers extending for their entire length.
Both dorsal arms hectocotylized; squarish, prominently keeled above, unequal, the right slightly the larger; much swollen; suckers very small, even at the base of the arms, whence they gradually diminish in size toward the tip, the two rows very regularly alternating; inner surface of each arm curiously striate with numerous fine transverse corrugations arranged more or less in bands to correspond with the bases of the sucker pedicels.
Suckers of the second pair of arms slightly larger, but still quite small, excepting some five pairs along the middle of the arm which are conspicuously larger than the rest; third pair similar in structure to the second pair; ventral arms shorter and more slender than the others, their suckers mainly lost in the specimen examined.
The pedicels of all the suckers, especially the enlarged ones, are very brittle and delicate.
Openings of suckers very small; horny rings smooth.
Arms connected at the extreme base by a poorly developed web or umbrella which is totally lacking between the ventral pair; dorsal arms laterally angled and with a dorsal keel; in the second pair angles and keel become obsolete, but reappear again in the third pair; ventral arms keeled along the outer side.
Tentacles stout and fleshy ; about as long as the mantle ; the club furnished with a membranous keel, but otherwise not exceeding the stalk in diameter; suckers extremely minute, subequal, irregularly arranged in at least 12 (perhaps as many as 16) rows, giving the club a velvety appearance; peduncles slender; the horny rings under the high power seem to be smooth, but the material examined is imperfectly stained.
Color in life unknown; in alcohol a pale brown, suffused here and there with blackish-purple.
Chromatophores numerous, appearing as dark dots.
As in the other species of the genus, the ventral surface of the mantle is marked by a large shield-shaped patch, over which the chromatophores are exceedingly fine, numerous, and evenly distributed; the patch is bordered by a rather indistinct slaty-blue margin.
Beak and radula not examined.

The generic type — S. leucoptera Verrill, from the North Atlantic — differs in the more complete webbing of the arms, their relative shortness, the more anterior position of the fins, hectocotylization (though affecting the same arms), and other details.
It is also stated to have the eyelids free all round, but from the appearance of the present specimen this should possibly be regarded as a physiological condition, rather than a permanent feature as in the cegopsid decapods.
The other Pacific form— S. iris Berry, from the Hawaiian Islands— totally different aspect and stands quite alone in the relative magnitude of its head and fins and the great width of the nuchal commissure.
If the type is adult, it is also a much smaller species than S. nipponensis.
Naef (1912) has recently made S. nipponensis the type of a new genus Sepiolina.

Family SEPIIDJE Steenstrup, 1861.
Genus SEPIA Linne, 1758.
The tremendous development of the genus Sepia, both in species and number of individuals, is the most conspicuous feature of the cephalopod fauna of Japan, as it is likewise in the waters of the Indo-Malayan Archipelago.
It is therefore not surprising to find that no less than eighteen names have at one time or another been applied to Japanese forms.
These are as follows: Sepia aculeata.
Sepia peterseni.
Sepia sinensis.

Sepia chrysophtalmos.
10 Sepia tokioensis.
Sepia myrsus.

9 Sepia sinensis d'Orbigny, 1839, united by Gray with S. inermis (van Hasselt), is a name applied by d'Orbigny to a squid described in an article in the Encyclopedic japonaisc.
Although Tryon follows Gray, it seems doubtful if the species is in any way recognizable.
10 Sepia chrysophtalmos Tilesius is a minute animal referred by d'Orbigny (1839, p. 324, Loligopsis, pi.
1, figs.
2-4, fide Hoyle) to Loligopsis, but probably impossible of determination.
11 Sepia myrsus Gray (1849, p. 10S) has been doubtfully listed in the Japanese fauna by Hoyle (1886, p. 219), but I know of no other reference to its actual occurrence there.
This list is somewhat reduced by the elimination of doubtful names, but even then contains many species which are not always easy to distinguish from one another and sometimes offer problems of great difficulty.
The entire group is much in need of a painstaking and thorough revision at the hands of someone having access to a wealth of carefully preserved material, and when this time comes it is possible that several of the nominal species may be reduced to the rank of synonyms.
A good many specimens have been available to the present writer, but the series have usually been too incomplete or, in the case of numerous market specimens, too poorly preserved to render accurate determination easy, much less afford ground for any important generalizations.
The majority of Japanese species belong to a rather well-defined group of narrow-shelled forms referred to by Wiilker as the "andreanaGruppe" and here for the sake of convenience recognized as a subgenus or section, to denominate which the term Doratosepion de Rochebrune has been rehabilitated.
An excellent discussion of these forms together with a detailed key to the same has been given by Wiilker (1910, pp.
17-20).

Wiilker has .
suggested that this species may be identical with S. elliptica and infers that Ortmann may have been mistaken in the most important diagnostic character — the presence of teeth on the horny rings of the sessile arm suckers.
I can, however, confirm Ortmann's observation.
Suckers of a specimen from Nagasaki show about 35 small, short, broadly conical teeth, their tips squarish (or broken ?
), developed with fair evenness all around.
In all other respects also this material agrees well with the description of S. hoylei, but indicates that this form is at best so weakly differentiated from S. elliptica that the conclusion attained by Wiilker may yet prove to be correct.
A specimen before me from Wakanoura is young and too poorly preserved for certain identification, but the gladius agrees well with the Nagasaki specimens.

Mantle margin produced into a prominent rounded angle above, but truncate or slightly emarginate below.
Head broad, flattened.
Eyes large, prominent.
Funnel broad, truncate at the apex, the latter barely reaching the gap between the ventral arms.
Anns subequal, somewhat over a third as long as the body; all more or less compressed, the third and fourth pairs conspicuously keeled.
Membranes bordering the sucker-bearing area well developed.
Suckers minute, cup-shaped, in four rows on all the arms; horny rings smooth.
K narrow umbrella connects all the arms at the base.
Tentacles rather short, stout, the clubs very large.
Suckers in about four to five rows; those of the two marginal series very minute, the median ones slightly larger and about six of the latter very much larger than any of the others, the three nearest the middle of the club being largest of all (PI.

The latter have smooth horny rings while those of the smaller suckers seem to be very minutely denticulate or crenate.
Surface smooth throughout.
Color dull buff -gray, heavily mottled above and more lightly dotted below with blackish-slate-colored chromatophores.
Gladius elongate-elliptical in outline, a little over one-third as broad as long; chitinous margin quite wide and narrowly continuous posteriorly across the short stout straight spine.
Dorsal surface finely rugose-granulose, the granules disposed in concentric series parallel to the anterior margin; two shallow converging grooves near the centre divide the shell into a narrow median and two wide lateral areas; the calcareous coating over the chitinous layer is very thin dorsally, especially near the edges.
Ventral surface excavated posteriorly; the striated area occupies about half the length of the shell, but its extreme posterior portion is obscured by the heavy callous which strengthens the inner cone.
The limbs of the callous arise near a point a little more than one-third the length of the shell from the posterior end.

The locular index of the gladius is about the same, unless in calculating it we exclude the chitinous margin, in which case the index is but about 37.
The calloused area is, however, relatively greater.
Other allied forms appear to be S. rouxii d'Orbigny (IndoMalayan), S. microcotyledon Ortmann (Ceylon), and possibly the Chinese S. sinope Gray, the two latter of which have been discussed by Ortmann (1891, p. 674).
S. microcotyledon is the only one described as having .smooth horny rings, but here the structure of the tentacle club is very different.
Curiously enough, I have been unable to discover any records of cephalopods from Formosa in any of the literature.
Although my search may not have been exhaustive, it is probable that the three species here recorded (Sepia formosana, Euprymna morsei, and Sepioteuthis lessoniana) are the first species to be accredited to the island.

It has been reported from Shumshn Island, Kurile Group, by Middendorff, and from Japan without more definite locality by Steenstrup.
It probably inhabits the whole northern part of the archipelago.

Abraliopsis scintillans Berry 1911a, p. 93.
Animal small, loliginiform ; the mantle thin, cylindrical in front; slender and tapering rapidly to an acute point posteriorly.
Fins very large, broadly sagittate, over three-fifths as long as the mantle, their total width at the point of greatest expansion about the same as the length; forward margins arcuate, descending abruptly inward from a nearly right angle anteriorly; angles of lateral margins rounded, a little less than right, well anterior of the middle; hinder margins concave, produced posteriorly to an acute point.
Anterior mantle margin slightly produced to form an obtuse median point above and a lateral angle on either side of the funnel.
Head large, flattened, excavated beneath.
Eyes enormous, rounded and frequently much protruding in preserved specimens; ocular apertures large, with a distinct sinus in front.
Funnel broad, compressed, little projecting; interior with a pocket-like valve near the tip; funnel organ comprising a large A-shaped median pad, with notably expanded limbs posteriorly situated on the dorsal wall, and two ovate ventro-lateral cushions (PI.
IX, fig.
5).
Each funnel-locking cartilage a large elongate-ovate plate, deeply excavated down the centre, the elevated margin conspicuously reflected, its cavity corresponding with a simple linear groove about 8 mm.
long on the inner surface of the mantle.
Arms of moderate length, nearly equal, the order of length in general 4, 3 = 2, 1, though the third pair is sometimes a little longer than the second.
In detailed structure the arms differ considerably; for the sake of more accurate observation, those of the left side of one specimen were removed and have furnished the following account.
Dorsal arm armed with 12 small stout hooks in two alternating rows, replaced by numerous minute suckers in two series at the extremity; on the outer margin along the whole length, except at the extreme base, is a broad colorless keel, widest below the middle of 28 426 the arm; along the ventral margin of the sucker-bearing area is a delicate hyaline swimming membrane supported by a series of fleshy lappets about equal in longitude to the hooks opposite which they lie.
Second arm also with 12 hooks (though on the right second arm of another specimen 14 hooks were counted) and otherwise in all essentials like the first.
The third arm likewise has 12 hooks succeeded by minute suckers at the tip; it is, however, more robust than any of the others; a very broad conspicuous hyaline membranous keel, unadorned with chromatophores on either surface, runs along the outer margin, at its widest point (near the middle) exceeding the diameter of the arm itself; ventral margin furnished with a hyaline swimming membrane as above, but its trabecule are much longer and larger.
Ventral arm (PL IX, fig.
4) with 11-12 hooks and no suckers, the whole extremity of the arm being bare except for the curious terminal organs described below; longer and more gradually tapering than the other arms, the hooks slightly smaller; devoid of swimming membranes, but there is a well-developed keel along the outer (dorsal) angle; the tip of each ventral arm is occupied by a longitudinal series of three large, ovoid, heavily pigmented, bead-like organs of a blackish color succeeded distally by one or two minute rudiments of similar structures where the tip of the arm suddenly tapers to a point; these are little protruding and have the superficial appearance of being enveloped within the substance of the arm itself, though really enclosed in the integument on the side of the latter; in size the central organ perhaps slightly surpassing the others (PL IX, fig.
1).
As all the specimens seen are females, the hectocotylized arm and other sexual characters have not been observed.
Tentacles slender, about the length of the mantle, sides compressed and somewhat flattened, inner surface of stalk flattened.
Clubs little or not at all expanded, the distal two-thirds armed with four distinct crowded rows of minute suckers, some 74 to 76 in all, 12 regularly diminishing in size toward the tip; proximal to these and projecting well out beyond the ventral margin are two very large, elongate, slender, strongly incurved, sharply pointed hooks projecting for some distance from their large fleshy bases; opposite these along the dorsal margin a single series of exceedingly minute -hort-pediceled suckers, usually four in number and apparently 12 Cf.
the figure given by Chun of A. morisii 9 (1910, pi.
8, fig.
3), where but about 40 such suckers are shown occupying a relatively much smaller proportion of the entire club.
homologous with the most marginal row of the distal suckers; proximal to the hooks and in a line with them on the right tentacle club is usually situated a single minute sucker similar to those just described.
Certain variations occur, as (e.g.)
in the club from which the accompanying figure (PI.
IX, fig.
6) was drawn; here the small suckers opposite the hooks were apparently wanting (through abrasion ?)
and were supplied in the drawing from another specimen.
The general character and extent of these variations are well brought out in the accompanying table of data taken from all the specimens examined and would seem to indicate that where the number of minute suckers is fewer than that above regarded as typical, it may be due to the facility with which such delicate structures may be lost by abrasion.

.
The distal (suckerbearing) part of the club is furnished with a membranous keel along its dorsal margin (PL IX, fig.
6).
Buccal membrane eight-pointed, papillose within; its color deep violet, the supporting lappets of a conspicuously paler shade outwardly.
Gladius (fig.
3) with broad wings, embracing the slender midrib for quite three-quarters of its length; only slightly subangulate laterally at the point of widest expansion.
Keel plainly visible through the dorsal integument as a dark median line.
13 Here a small sucker is also present between this row and the proximal hook.
12s [July, Radula not examined.
Integument with numerous minute photogenic organs, appearing as dark bluish dots having a distinctly paler centre.
These are distributed as follows: (1) on the ventral surface of the mantle they are everywhere exceedingly numerous and so evenly distributed that a bilateral arrangement is only apparent after close examination, being even then not at all absolute; definite rows indistinguishable except for a narrow but distinct and fairly conspicuous area entirely free of photophores and forming a straight longitudinal band down the medio-ventral line with a fairly constant width of scarce more than a millimeter throughout its course; the number of photophores in one of the rows bordering it is from 42 to 45.
Laterally, the organs rapidly scatter and diminish in size until they •>&:&:&:: w 9 W mm ■ p'4»Y # Fig.

are only with difficulty to be made out at all.
However, I have been unable to find that they extend very much past the level of the eyes.
2.
On the ventral aspect of the funnel the photogenic organs are similar in character to those of the mantle, but are fewer in number and therefore appear more symmetrically disposed.
They !
ranked in about ten poorly defined longitudinal rows, variously distant and containing 3-4 organs each, but the arrangement of two lateral halves is alike and here again they are separated by a clear space down the middle.
3.
On the ventral surface of the head the photophores have evidently a primary arrangement in longitudinal series, but this has become so modified by the interpolation of various shorter series and isolated organs that the exact number of rows is difficult to determine.
Most apparent are (a) the usual median row which bifurcates at the apex of the funnel groove and at the base of the ventral arms, along which latter its two branches continue for the proximal two-thirds of their length; (6) a long lateral series beginning on the ventral fold of the olfactory crest which curves inward on the head and also continues out the ventral arms to their extremities; (c) a very distinct circlet of more ovoid organs surrounding the ocular aperture (PL IX, fig.
2).
4.
The ventral arms as just noted have two rows of photophores upon the arm itself, and in addition a distinct row of 7-8 small very distant organs along the outer margin of the keel.
The third arms have but a single row of 4-5 organs along their ventral aspect.
On the remaining arms, on the tentacles, and on the dorsal surface of the head no luminous organs were observed.
In addition to the photogenic organs of the general integument and the curious pigmented structures already described at the tips of the ventral arms, there is a third very distinct type of photophore in the form of a series of small circular bead-like bodies, brownishorange in color, on the ventral periphery of the eyeball; these are five in number, the three central ones smallest and interspaced from one another about a millimeter; the two terminal ones are each distant about 1| mm.
from the neighboring organ and their diameter is about twice as great (i.e., rather less than a millimeter) (PL IX, fig.
3).
These organs, though situated on the eyeball itself, are usually visible even when the latter is closely retracted, because of a small ovate hyaline non-pigmented area in that portion of the ventral integument which normally covers them.
When, as sometimes occurs, this area is iridescent and a little distended, it becomes quite conspicuous.
Its purpose is obviously to allow the rays of light from these organs to pass through the outer integument with as little obstruction as possible.
Color in life not observed; in alcoholic specimens the ground color is a pale brownish-buff, dotted over nearly the entire surface with small and very beautiful reddish-brown chromatophores, which are especially numerous and darkest just above the keel of the gladius, but thickly scattered, even on the ventral surface where they are very conspicuous among the bluish photophores.
On 430 [July, the under sides of the fins, the hyaline area above described, the inner surfaces of the arms, and the keels of the three dorsal pairs the skin is nearly or entirely free of chromatophores.
Because appearing with unusual constancy, a single large chromatophore, surrounded by a circlet of smaller ones and situated on the head just posterior to the crotch between the dorsal arms, is also probably worthy of mention.
The lens of the eye is large, spherical, and exquisitely pearly.

Remarks.
— This beautiful little squid was originally described from three individuals in the Stanford University collections thought to be from Japan, but in reality of quite uncertain origin.
This habitat was, however, confirmed in a most interesting manner, almost immediately upon the preparation of the original diagnosis, by the receipt through the kindness of Dr. Harold Heath of three "squids with luminous dots," sent to him from Japan by Dr. Ijima.
These were the specimens mentioned above from Misaki and proved to be identical in every essential feature with the types, entirely confirming in every particular the characters which I had depended upon as diagnostic.
Both the Stanford specimens and those sent by Dr. Ijima are beautifully preserved, are nearly of the same size, and apparently fully grown.
One of the largest, if not the largest species of the genus, A. scintillans, is differentiated from the previously described forms in the following apparently constant characters : 1.
The great number of photophores on the ventral surface and the comparative obscurity of their bilateral arrangement as well as the absence of distinct longitudinal series.
2.
The presence of only one row of hooks (the ventral) on the tentacle club, with but two elements present even here.
3.
The replacement of the dorsal row of hooks present in other species by a single or slightly zigzag series of minute suckers.
4.
The large number of suckers in the four distal rows on the club and the fact that these occupy nearly two-thirds of the total length.
5.
The usual presence of four suckers and four pads in the fixing apparatus.
6.
The detailed structure of the sessile arms which appears to differ constantly from the careful account given by Hoyle (1904, p. 37) in regard to A. hoy lei.
With these features in mind, it is by no means difficult to separate A. scintillans from either the Atlantic A. pfefferi or the A. hoylei of the South and East Pacific, 14 with both of which it is, however, closely allied.
It is to be expected that any structure so complex 14 Chun, in a recent monograph (1910, p. 78), unites both of these forms under the earliest name applied to a member of the genus, A. morisii Verany, 1837, and gives a large number of exquisitely beautiful figures of a series supposed to be identical.
The evidence offered is certainly suggestive, but does not appear to the present writer to be conclusive proof that we have but a single cosmopolitan species of Abraliopsis, however closely related otherwise the various forms may be.
as the armature of the tentacle club should be subject to a considerable degree of variation among its constituent elements, so that its great constancy in the present series is really quite surprising and indicates that it may prove especially important in distinguishing species.
The discovery of males of this species should throw an interesting light upon the entire subject.
In gross aspect and general outline of the body there is great variation, depending upon the conditions of preservation.
The greatest individualities observed are in the form of the mantle.
Sometimes the outline tapers smoothly and regularly from the anterior margin, or there may be a pronounced bulging near the middle, or sometimes a general inflation of the whole.

[Pfeffer also unites with this species the O. insignis of Gould, 1852, ascribed to the Fiji Islands and the Antarctic region.]
Body elongate, cylindric, tapering posteriorly to a sharp point between the fins.
Mantle margin entire above and but little emarginate below.
Fins broadly sagittate, in the adult a little more than two-fifths as long as the mantle.
.
Mantle connectives as usual in the group.
Head rather small, squarish, but much compressed, considerably narrower than the widest expansion of the body; bounded posteriorly by a transverse thickened ridge, continuous with the three oblique ear-like folds behind each eye.
Eyes large, the wide lid openings with a narrow incision or sinus in front.
Funnel groove with a distinct foveola in its anterior portion, comprising a horseshoeshaped fold of membrane embracing between its arms a series of 8-10 shorter and more fleshy longitudinal folds.
Armmoderate, squarish, fairly attenuate, averaging about half as long as the mantle; unequal, the order of length almost always 2, 3, 1.
4, although there are occasionally slight variations from this formula.
Umbrella lacking, but the outer angles of all the arms equipped with a firm fleshy keel especially developed on the basal half of the third pair, and a delicate trabeculated swimming membrane, which is least evident on the ventral arms and widest on the ventral margin of the third pair.
Suckers decidedly small (PL VI, fig.
4) ; rather distantly placed at the base in two regularly alternating rows, becoming more crowded at the tip; the interspacing between the rows very variable, apparently dependent mainly upon the degree of compression of the arms; suckers of the lateral arms slightly, but not at all conspicuously larger than those of the dorsal and ventral pairs; on an arm of the second pair some 56 to 60 suckers can readily be counted without using a lens.
Horny rings well developed, their lower margins ordinarily smooth, but with 9 to 12 stout acute teeth, accompanied by occasional intervening denticles on the upper edge; these teeth are largest at the apex, but the median one is not particularly differentiated in this respect more than its neighbors.
Tentacles stout, moderate; the club slightly expanded, its suckerbearing portion including about 60-65% of the total length in the adult (55-71%, according to Pfeffer); in general structure entirely similar to 0. hawaiiensis, 15 the horny rings of the large median suckers armed with about 17 rather short, stout, acute, subequal teeth, occurring in regular alternation with an equal number of very low squarish plates, both teeth and plates being more regular, though somewhat more weakly developed than in 0. hawaiiensis.
A small sucker of the marginal rows shows about 18 acute teeth, larger and longer on the upper margin where they are accompanied by a few alternating denticles.
In young specimens, such as No.
273, the body appears more slender and the fins much shorter, both in proportion to the mantle length and their own width.
The* chief measurements of eight specimens are given in the following table: .

OBSERVATIONS 05 THE STRUCTURE OF SOME CORAL BEDS IN THE HAMILTON SHALE.
BY BURNETT SMITH.
In the majority of the Paleozoic systems layers of rock occasionally occur which are made up in large part of the remains of corals.
These coral masses in the attitudes and in the mutual crowding of their individuals, as well as in their general field relations, exhibit conclusive evidence that they lie in the position of original growth.
From certainly the Silurian upward we find among such coral layers many which in structure approach, to a greater or less degree, the reefs of existing seas.
Such fossil reefs are, as might be expected, more abundant in the limestones, and probably the Silurian and Devonian rocks of this type furnish us with the best examples which are to be found throughout the North American Paleozoic series.
1 In most cases, however, the reefs can be studied for only a small part of their extent.
For instance, the Onondaga limestone of New York State is in many localities and through much of its thickness nothing more than an old reef, but here, as a rule, only a small horizontal section is exposed and the delimiting of the actual margins of the coral masses must be left to the field of conjecture.
In the later Hamilton shale of the same region corals are a rather inconspicuous element when compared with the rich fauna of brachiopods and mollusks.
Locally, however, we find in the shales layers which are composed of corals to the practical exclusion of other forms of ife.
Such layers are, in the main, of small thickness, and in studying them we are again confronted with the usual limited horizontal exposure.
The coral reefs (if they can be dignified with the term) which form the basis for this description are an exception in this hot respect, for they present a large and very beautiful exposure of about a mile along the eastern shore of Skaneateles Lake, in Onondaga County, New York.
For purposes of convenience in presentation it is advisable to consider these structures under the following headings: (1) The Chamberlin, in Geology of Wisconsin, vol.

447 Large Southern Reef; (2) The Channel, and (3) The Small Northern Reef.
The Large Southern Reef.
— As we follow the shore of the lake northwestward from Spafford Landing (Skaneateles Quadrangle, U. S. G. S.), the corals first appear above water level on the north side of a small point known locally under the terms Ivy Point and also Willow Point.
The reef at its first appearance ranges from 3.5 feet to 4 feet thick and is made up almost entirely of the hard parts of Zaphrentis, Heliophyllum, and Cystiphyllum, together with the silt which filled the interstices between the growing corals and brought an end to their growth.
The reef maintains this uniform character and thickness as far northwestward as the point known locally as Staghorn Point — a distance of approximately two-thirds of a mile.
From Ivy Point the reef rises gradually for a ways, then runs with little or no dip well up toward Staghorn Point, where the N W Otaiylwn It Diagrammatic northwest-southeast section of the Staghorn Point Coral Masses in the Hamilton Shale of Skaneateles Lake, N. Y. Reefs in solid black.

dip increases.
Its base is from 1 to 2 feet above high-water mark just south of Staghorn Point.
Throughout this distance (from Ivy Point to Staghorn Point) the reef is apparently entirely conformable with the beds above and below.
It is underlaid by thickly bedded hard limy shale, which carries a characteristic Hamilton fauna rich in brachiopods and mollusks.
It is immediately overlaid by shales carrying a sparse fauna, the typical Hamilton assemblage reappearing a few feet above the reef.
In the reef itself the species of brachiopods and mollusks, so abundant throughout the rest of the Hamilton, are almost entirely lacking.
Just north of Staghorn Point the base of the reef is about 5 feet above the lake level and its thickness has fallen to about 3 feet.
For a distance of about 700" feet northward the reef rises until it is finally about 8 feet above the level of the lake, while during this rise it thins rapidly down to about 9 inches in thickness.
Throughout this thinning it still maintains the same conformable relations with the thickly bedded shales below and the thinly bedded shales above, as were observed south of Staghorn Point.
The reef now takes a sharp drop toward the north and thin layers of corals and limy shales fan away from it (PI.
X, PI.
XI, fig.
1).
Awe approach lake level the mass of corals thickens, but it is soon lost again in the complex of thin interbedded layers.
We are here evidently on the northern border of the southern reef.
The Channel.
— The space between the reef above described and that which lies to the north was evidently an open channel during most of the time when the corals of the two reefs flourished.
The abrupt descent of the fanning layers from both reefs toward midchannel and the discordance with the uniform southerly dip of the shales which later overwhelmed the reefs point conclusively to contemporaneous erosion for an explanation of the observed phenomena.
This channel was gradually filled with limy silt, and occasionally an invasion of undersized corals ventured out into the currents only to be stifled by more silt without attaining maturity.
These conditions are recorded by from 7 to 8 feet of thin limy shales and interbedded colonies of scattered corals.
Ripple marks and cross-bedding in the limy layers bear witness to the shallowness as well as to the motion of the water in this old channel.
The Small Northern Reef.
— At the southern edge of this small reef the conditions observed at the northern margin of the larger southern reef are duplicated.
A thick mass of corals occurs near the lake level.
These corals rise rapidly and during their rise from the lake the beds deposited in the old channel are seen to fan away from them.
The reef rises sharply to a height of 10 feet above the lake, and here it is little more than a foot in thickness.
Followed a short distance north, the conditions on the southern edge are again met with, the reef descends rapidly, thickens, and thin limy shales and coral colonies fan away from the main mass.
Just north of the reef border this series of thin, ripple-marked, limy shales and seams of corals is about 9 or 10 feet thick.
These beds, which owe their origin to the coral growths and to the disintegration of the corals, maintain their character for some distance along the lake shore — that is, for some tance away from the reef (PI.
XI, fig.
3), but, being reef -margin dep< heir distinctive features disappear as the distance from the reef increases, and we can observe a gradual lateral transition into contemporaneous shale of the typical Hamilton fades.
2 Sequence of Events.
— In interpreting the observed facts we can assume with reasonable certainty that a local shallowing of the Hamilton Sea combined with an introduction of clearer water currents produced the conditions which were favorable to the growth of the corals.
The limy shales were followed by communities of corals.
During the growth of these beds currents kept a channel excavated in the northern portion of the region of coral *growth.
This channel was slowly filled with lime mud derived from the growing reefs and by invading colonies of corals, which latter, however, were never able to maintain their existence for long in the waters of the channel.
Lime muds also derived from the reefs spread out for a small space around the northern margin of the area of coral growth.
When the channel between the two reefs was nearly filled with lime mud, the whole reef area was overwhelmed by fine land-derived clay muds.
This effectually stopped the growth of the reefs, exterminating the corals and reintroducing the prevalent fauna of the Hamilton Seas.
Correlations.
As far as the author has been able to learn, the few references to the Staghorn Point coral masses which are to be found in geological literature are rather short and incidental.
In view, however, of the advisability of correlating these reefs with one of the various Hamilton coral-bearing beds which occur in other portions of the county and of the State, the author believes it pertinent to mention here such references as are known to him.
In 1886 Mr. E. B. Knapp, 3 in a paper read before the Educational Council of Onondaga County and published at a later date, speaks of the principal collecting grounds for corals in the local Hamilton.
We find also that he gives 6 feet as the thickness of the "old coral reef" at Staghorn Point.
Schneider, 4 in 1894, speaks very briefly of "the ancient coral reef at Staghorn Point" as an excellent collecting ground for cyathophylloid corals, but makes no mention of the size or structure of the reef.
2 We have good negative evidence that the section above described is near the western limit of the coral masses, for considerable search has failed to disclose any reefs on the western shore of Skaneateles Lake.
3 Knapp, E. B., Glimpses of the Geology of Onondaga County, p. 5.
4 .Schneider, P. F., Notes on the Geology of Onondaga County, Syracuse, 1894.
Luther, 5 in his Economic Geology of Onondaga County, New York (p. 282), saj's: "On the east shore, near Staghorn Point, is a very remarkable bed of fossil corals.
It is a solid mass of cyathophylloid or cup corals, together with other genera.
It is 5 feet thick at the thickest place, and is exposed along the shore, near the level of the water, for a distance of a quarter of a mile or more.
Thousands of specimens, some of them 10 or 12 inches long, and sufficiently suggestive of staghorns to give the name to the point, are in sight in the lay#r or loose in the water.
This coral reef, or a similar one at about the same horizon, is exposed at Lord's Hill, several miles northeast, and along the hillside w T est of Otisco Lake.
From its position it seems probable that this bed is the eastern extension of the Encrinal band of the western counties, which abounds in cyathophylloid corals of the same species."
Cleland, 6 in his Fauna of the Hamilton Formation of the Cayuga Lake Section in Central New York (p. 85), after refering to Luther's observations, says: "Since in Ontario, Seneca, and Cayuga Counties the most abundant coral faunas are in the Basal Hamilton, either this coral reef at Skaneateles Lake is (1) a continuation of the stratum called the 'Basal Hamilton,' which is several hundred feet above the Alarcellus shales in the Cayuga Lake section, or (2) the Encrinal, or (3) the union of (1) and (2), or (4) a separate stratum."
Lower on the same page we find: "East of Cayuga Lake the correlation of the coral zones is yet to be worked out.
However, conditions of sedimentation, such as would produce a limestone stratum anywhere in the Middle Hamilton, would be adapted to and contain what might be called a limestone fauna which would not differ materially from the fauna of the Encrinal; and whether this stratum were continuous or not, the same association of fossil would probably exist."
Leaving the interesting question of the possible equivalency of the Staghorn Point reefs with "the Encrinal" or some other of the western lime bands, let us return to the much nearer coral layers which are found to the east and northeast of Staghorn Point.
Luther's locality of "Lord's Hill" I have so far been unable to identify with absolute certainty, but the exposures on the "hillside west of Otisco Lake" are numerous and probably most of them have been visited.
These latter are known to exhibit an approximately northwest and southeast outcrop for about 3 miles, and as the 5 Luther, D. D., Rep. N. Y.
State Geologist, 1895.
6 Cleland, H. F., Bull.
206, U. S. G. S. lower limit of the corals ranges in altitude between 1,000 feet and 1,060 feet it is reasonable to assume that the exposures trend not far from the line of strike.
The coral beds of the Otisco Valley present certain differences from the Staghorn Point masses.
In the first place, the coralline strata are usually thicker, probably 10 feet thick at the northernmost exposure examined, while at a ravine cutting across the north and south road which leads to the Otisco causeway 7 we find two beds of corals — a lower one of undetermined thickness at 1,000 feet altitude separated by non-coralline shales from an upper bed which is at least 30 feet thick.
The Otisco exposures are for the most part in very narrow gullies choked with debris, and though there can be no doubt that they represent an essentially continuous system, the exact structure is hardly determinable.
The question then naturally arises as to whether or no these Otisco Valley reefs are the contemporaries and the stratigraphic equivalents of the Staghorn Point reefs.
Checks with a reliable reference plane are hard to make in the Otisco Valley, but the coral masses appear to lie about 300 feet below the base of the Tully limestone, while in the Skaneateles Valley the corresponding difference is about 360 feet.
Considering the great variations in thickness which these coral masses exhibit, we are, it is believed, justified in regarding this evidence as pointing to essential stratigraphic equivalency.
Regarding, then, the Otisco Valley and the Staghorn Point masses as a practically contemporaneous system of coral bodies growing in the same sea, it is advisable to notice here two other Onondaga County exposures — those near the hamlets of Vesper and Joshua (Tully Quadrangle, U. S. G. S.).
The Vesper Reef is exposed in the Fellows Falls ravine and has been mentioned very briefly by Clarke 8 and Luther as "exposed in the Fellows Falls ravine 3 miles west of Tully. "
This bed is about 6 feet and 4 inches thick and lies approximately 350 feet below the Tully limestone or in practical agreement with the Staghorn Point reefs.
The coral layers near Joshua 9 lie at a much higher altitude than any of the others and their exact horizon is much less susceptible of precise determination.
They are exposed between the 1,180 and 7 The causeway is represented in an unfinished condition on the topographic map of the Skaneateles Quadrangle (U. S. G. S.).

1,300 feet contours about 1| miles southeast of Joshua and some nine miles from Staghorn Point in a northeasterly direcAs this line corresponds quite closely to the general direction of dip of the Hamilton shales, the difference in altitude in no way precludes the stratigraphic equivalency of the Joshua and Staghorn Point beds.
Though the horizontal exposure is very limited at the Joshua locality, we are furnished with quite an extensive vertical section.
Enough is revealed to allow us to say that here we have an upper reef some 65 feet thick separated by barren shales from one or more thinner reefs.
Allowing, then, essential contemporaneity for the Onondaga County coral masses already mentioned, it is well in passing to say that other coral-bearing localities to the east of Vesper and Joshua have not yet been visited, while to the west of Staghorn Point the absence of definite reefs in the Skaneateles Valley renders Luther's suggestion of correlation with the "Encrinal band" still an open question.
TheCoral-bearing Drift of the Otisco Valley.
— Along the eastern side of the Otisco Valley exposures of the bed rock are, on the whole, quite rare.
So far none of the exposures examined have shown coral beds in situ.
The glacial drift, on the other hand, is very high in cyathophylloid corals.
The ultimate source of drift inclusions is always open to some question, but in the present case the corals, besides being specifically identical with those of the Hamilton reefs, are also of the same general size and in many cases carry adherent fragments of the Hamilton matrix.
10 After the examination of a large number of specimens the author believes that no reasonable doubt can exist as to the origin of these fossils.
In places the drift is so packed with corals as to preclude the theory of transportation for any considerable distance.
Everything, in fact, points to a very local source, and unless we ascribe this to the Joshua reefs alone, it is believed that we are warranted in assuming the presence of extensive though drift-covered Hamilton reefs along the eastern wall of the Otisco Valley.
Though the exact horizon of such hypothetical reefs must, of course, remain in doubt, the probabilities are that it coincides quite closely with the horizon of those Hamilton reefs which we can see in place.
In view of the great number of corals in the local Onondaga limestone, and in view of the fact that the Hamilton species are also found in the limestone, night be urged that some of this is Onondaga drift.
The Hamilton reefs are, , made up almost entirely of Zaphrentis, Heliophyllum, and Cystiphyllum, )nondaga contains not only many additional genera of corals, but an associated Brachiopods, Bryozoa, Crinoid stems, etc.
These s have not been found in the Otisco Valley drift.

453 Summary.
From the observations briefly outlined in this paper, it is believed that we can draw the following conclusions concerning the geological history of this area in central New York: (1) During Hamilton time a considerable surface of the sea-bottom shallowed, this shallowing being accompanied by the introduction of clear ocean currents with the resultant cessation or at least interruption of mud deposition.
(2) These physical changes of sea-bottom and of sea produced conditions favorable to the growth and development of the same coral fauna throughout the greater part of the area.
The coral growths varied greatly in thickness with the locality.
In places they endured for a considerable time, while in other nearby situations the growth was discontinuous and the history is recorded in the strata by thin interbedded coral bands and limy shales — the probable records of old channels.
(3) Though these changes, physical and faunal, were of short duration when compared with the whole of Hamilton time, they nevertheless represent perhaps the most striking episode in the history of the Hamilton Sea in this area, namely, a transitory return to Onondaga-like conditions, followed again by the mud-bearing waters and the mud-loving fauna of the typical Hamilton.
Among the unsolved problems connected with these reefs perhaps of most importance are the following: (a) Correlation with coral-bearing horizons in the western portion of the State.
(6) Determination of the direction from which the faunal and environmental invasion came.
(c) Possible correlation with some important, though perhaps distant, crustal movement.

Explanation of Plates X and XI.
Plate X.
— Coral layers fanning away from the northern margin of the Southern Reef (see text figure, S) near Staghorn Point, Skaneateles Lake, N. Y.
Eroded shale (a) below, followed by fan or wedge-shaped reef-margin deposits (6), with thinly, bedded shale (c) at the top.
Plate XI.
— Reef and reef -margin deposits near Staghorn Point, Skaneateles Lake, N. Y.
Fig.

— Coral layers fanning away from the northern margin of the Southern Reef (text figure, S).
Illustrates the abrupt northward (to the left) descent of the marginal deposits (b) into the channel (see text figure, C) and the truncation of the southward dipping shale (a) below.
Fig.
2.
— Northern margin of the Southern Reef.
In this figure the reef itself cannot be distinguished, but its base is shown by the top of the truncated shale below the reef.
The discordance between the line of truncation (x, y) and the southward dip of the shale above the reef is also illustrated.
Fig.
3.
— Reef-margin deposits about the northern border of the Northern Reef (see text figure, N).
These deposits lie beyond the area in which fanning occurs and their alternating hard and soft layers are essentially parallel.
The hard layers are limy and the soft layers are friable shale.
