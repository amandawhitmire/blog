NOTES ON THE MOLLUSKS OF THE COLORADO DESERT I.
By S. Stillman Berry.
1 .  INTRODUCTION.
Topographically geologically and biologically the Colorado Desert is unique among all the very diverse natural areas of the state of California only its sister desert to the north the Mojave affording a partial parallel.
It is likewise one of the most interesting of these areas.
Nearly every wanderer who has been fated to enter its portals as even now the present writer seems to have felt it incumbent upon him to add his mite to the printed record with the result that an extensive literature of the region is already in existence and grows apace.
Nevertheless and in face of the fact this is still in many respects a little known country.
1 1 In addition to the titles cited in the bibliography there are a number of works not dealing with the Mollusca which nevertheless have such important bearing toward an understanding of the desert and its bionomics that it seems worth while to include a brief list of a few which have been found particularly helpful in this manner.

The very name desert seems to imply a terrain ill suited for these softbodied coolblooded animals and it has been only a few years since that we began to realize that aridity far from prohibiting life of this sort actually has seemed in many instances to tend directly toward an increase in the variety and richness of the fauna.
Whether this would be true in that classical type of desert which consists only of long Avifauna no.

unbroken stretches of flattish sandy country may well be doubted but where as here the many mountain ranges form islands of a slightly less degree of desiccation the snails are given a chance to maintain a figurative toehold and in time to become better adapted their desert environment while meanwhile the principle of isolation comes into play.
It is only recently that it has been discovered that if numbers of species are to be regarded as criteria the true molluscan metropolis of North America is not in tropic Florida nor in the swampy lowlands of Louisiana and Texas nor in the forests of the northwest but in dry Arizona where every mountain range in some cases almost every canyon seems to harbor its own peculiar landsnail fauna.
There are of course numerous widespread species principally minute but the multitude are surprisingly local in their distribution.
While it is perhaps not to be expected that the region under discussion will prove to rival southern Arizona enough has now been done to show that further exploration will yield substantial rewards.
The land snails naturally constitute the great unknown.
Nevertheless fluviatile mollusks likewise are more important and numerous than might be suspected.
The Colorado Desert.
 The term Colorado Desert has been somewhat variously applied by different writers but the most logical as well as historically the most precise use of the name is undoubtedly the definition given by its original proponent Prof. W. P. Blake who writes 14 p. 67 15 p. 2122 'The name 'Colorado Desert' was given to this region by the writer in 1853.
This was before the State of Colorado received its name.
It was deemed most appropriate to connect the name of the Colorado River with the region inasmuch as the desert owes its origin to the river by the deposition of alluvions and the displacement of the seawater.
A tendency is shown by some writers to extend the area known as the Colorado Desert so as to include the arid regions north of it especially the mountainous region along the Colorado ami the Mojave partly known today as the 'Mojave Desert.'
This was not the intention or wish of the author of the name.
It was intended to apply it strictly to the typical desert area of the lacustrine clays and alluvial deposits of the Colorado where extreme characteristic desert conditions prevail such as arid treeless plains old lake beds and sand hills  such conditions as are found in the Sahara of Africa and in the delta regions of the Nile.
I should also include the bordering detrital slopes from the contiguous mountains.
So restricted the area is practically coterminous with the ancient beachlines and terraces of the lakes whic hoccupied the valley.
Its area is estimated at not less than 2100 square miles its breadth east and west opposite Carrizo Creek about 33 miles.
Its height above tide ranges from 135 feet above sealevel at Yuma to an average of 42 feet following the old shore line of Cahuilla Lake and to minus 187 feet now partly submerged.
The only possible criticism of this definition is that restricted in this way it becomes too purely geological and genetic for convenient application to a physiographic phenomenon like a desert.
 Vrtainly a broadly conceived faunistic study of the region cannot so confine itself.
For the purpose of such a study most workers will find it more practicable to define the region as that roughly enclosed on the north and northeast by the desert slopes of the San Bernardino Mountains and the divide which is formed by their depauperate southeastern spurs the Cottonwood Chuckawalla and Chocolate Mountains and which separates the Cahuilla Basin from the more diffused Mojave Desert further north on the east and southeast by the Colorado River and on the southwest and west by the eastern escarpment of the Peninsular Range and the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains.
The entire area will even then fall within the confines of the single major life zone known as the Lower Sonoran unless one prefers to draw the desert boundary far enough up the circumventing mountains to include some portions of the Upper Sonoran zone.
Thus understood the general outline of the desert is roughly triangular with the base on the Colorado River the apex at the San Gorgonio Pass and comprising within it the eastern portion of Riverside County the whole of Imperial County and a little of the eastern edge of San Diego County California while the southern corner of the triangle juts over into the Mexican territory of Lower  alifornia.
San Bernardino County is barely touched in the vicinity of the Morongo.
If Death Valley be excepted the region is doubtless quite unique within the borders of the United Slates if not in the world.
From the floor of the Salton Sink which lies 265 feet below sea level there is a gradual ascent of the desert floor to a line varying from nearly sealevel to about 2500 feet along i he base of the mountains which then rise abruptly to varying heights the most loftly being San Jacinto Peak with an elevation of 10805 feel and San Gorgonio Peak 11485 feet high.
By reason of their prevailingly granitic formations lack of foothills and consequent abrupt ascent from the desert floor the desert mountain ranges show a common peculiarity of contour which is pictured with especial felicity by J. Smeaton Chase in his very readable book California Desert Trails 19 p. 7  The characteristic contour form of the desert mountain ranges is another element in the beauty of desert color.
Like geological models set on a table they stand up sharply defined from the general level arresting the glance with new conspicuous effects.
No gently modelled approaches prepare the eye for the change of plane.
From gray or drab expanse of sand they rear up walllike profiles of red or ochre.
Perspective is dwarfed by the clearness of air increasing the sense of verticality.
Instead of rising from the desert these mountains stand upon it explicit bald almost artificial.
Mt.
San Jacinto furnishes the supreme example of these sudden changes in level.
Measuring horizontally north on the topographic map from the peak to various points in Snow Creek Canyon and vicinity one finds a span of but 3 24 miles from the summit to the 2000foot contour or of only 5 miles to the 1400foot contour a net drop of 9405 feet.
To the east of the peak the fall to the 500foot contour takes place in less than seven horizontal miles.
Very frequently of course less extreme descents take place much more abruptly.
Occurrence of Land Snails.
 It has been deemed best to include the foregoing brief account of the region because an understanding of its peculiar topography is of the utmost importance to the malacologist in view of the fact that the land snail fauna of the desert so far as known is confined wholly to these steep mountain slopes.
From the Colorado Desert in the technically geological sense of Blake endemic terrestrial mollusks are probably wholly lacking.
The massive granitic fragments which litter the mountain bases the obliquity with reference to the rays of the sun of all slopes but the hot southern exposures and the modicum of moisture however scanty which seeps down from the heights all serve to render possible the continued existence in such situations of these remarkably adapted xerobic creatures in a way not possible even for them on the scorching floor of the desert a stone's toss away.
West of Indian Well I found myself literally able to collect Micrarionta xerophila from the steep mountain slope while standing with both feet firmly planted on the valley floor where the most careful search discovered for us not a trace of a snail.
No doubt there are many places where a repetition of this experience would be possible.
In the deep canyons which gash these precipitous ranges conditions are frequently rather more favorable for land mollusks though even here one encounters them on the slopes and rarely if at all along the watercourses themselves.
Although sometimes quite abundant at least in the form of chalkywhite dead shells scattered about the surface of the ground they are often so rare that living specimens become quite difficult to detect.
Consequently but few have found their way into the hands of students.
If for practical reasons the now almost legendary Helix damascenus of Gould 2 be excepted Bowers' discovery near Indio of the snail described by Yates in 1890 as Helix Carpenteri var.
Indioensis but first recorded by Orcutt in 1889 was the earliest to be published.
Almost simultaneously Orcutt reported the occurrence of a form .of Helix from Snow Creek and Palm Canyons which probably represented the species which Bartsch described from Palm Springs specimens in 1903 as Sonorella walcottiana.
Meanwhile Bryant in 1900 had described two snails from the San Jacinto Mts. 
under the names bowersi and harperi.
Although very insufficiently known at least one of these and quite possibly both belong to the same group of characteristic desert snails as those already noted.
In 1904 Bartsch described Sonorella bailey i orcutt i from material collected by Orcutt in the Colorado Desert.
All the foregoing seem to have been described or recorded in each instance from dead shells only.
It has only been very recently that Dr. Emmet Rixford collected living examples of wolcottiana at Palm Springs which Pilsbry 18 has shown to possess the anatomical characteristics of the genus Micrarionta.
.
And this so far as I can discover quite completes the record although a number of allied species of Micrarionta have been described from the ranges of the adjoining Mojave and Arizona deserts.

The original locality is given by Gould as Desert region east of California collected by Dr. Frick.
Unless Frick's record is very far astray the species can have little to do with Micrarionta pandorae Forbes.
With the exception of the small and in many respects peculiar species which is described in the present paper from Whitewater Canyon the desert helicoids seem invariably to occupy the same sort of situations and to have essentially similar habits.
They have not yet been discovered deep down in rockslides like so many of the Arizonian species but generally aestivating under blocks and boulders of granite or among the loose soil and rubble in the crevices thereof.
When active they frequently come to the surface where at favorable moments they may be found in the open crawling.
Beyond this little is known of their habits their food supply or their position in the general bionomic economy as is a natural sequence of the fact that without any doubt the very great majority of existing species are still unknown to us in any way whatsoever.
The distribution of the desert palm.
Neowashingtonia filamentosa has been plotted out with a view to showing its probable relationship to the ancient shore line of the Gulf of California which seems to have extended well up into this basin at no very distant period.
Whether anything of the sort will be possible with the land snails remains to be seen but it is at least an interesting speculation whether the characteristic desert Eremarionta was not itself at one time a maritime group as the more typical section of Micrarionta still remains to this day.
Of the numerous North American groups of land snails smaller than the helicoids none appears to have been recorded from the area under discussion hitherto.
Freshwater Mollusca.
 In nearly complete contrast to the land snails interest in the freshwater Mollusca necessarily centers almost exclusively in the relictcovered bed of the ancient Lake Cahuilla in other words the Colorado Desert in the exact original sense of that term.
The wonder caused by the enormous numbers of the stranded shells which fill the soil in many parts of the valley and the interest aroused by the eventual discovery of many of the same species still flourishing in certain of the outlying springs and rivulets has long attracted attention to this part of the fauna.
The pioneer publication dealing with a freshwater mollusk of this region was probably that of Lea '52 who described his Anodonta Calif orniensis from the Rio Colorado California.
A few years later Gould '55 applied names to five species of freshwater mollusks from the desert proper most of which are still in use for those species.
Among the more important works since that time are a furl her paper by Gould '56 a brief account by Orcutt '89 some incidental notes by Dall '96 and Pilsbry '99 and especially the succession of papers by Stearns 79 '82 '83 '83a '93 which finally culminated 01 in a comprehensive monograph of the freshwater mollusks based principally upon the desert fossils.
The occurrence of these fossils in windrows at varying depths in the friable soil and in the travertine of the terraces has been of the greatest interest to the geologist engaged in tracing the past history of the basin and they therefore receive at least passing mention in many general works on the Desert.
There is little doubt that a more truly exhaustive study than has yet been attempted will be fruitful of results of the utmost value not alone to the geologist but to the systematist the ecologist and thanks to the extraordinary character of the variations passed through by some of the forms perhaps even to the student of evolution and the geneticist.
Except in the bibliography given the present paper touches on the freshwater mollusks only incidentally.

3. SPECIES COLLECTED IN THE COLORADO DESERT IN 1919 AND 1920 WITH NOTES ON OTHERS.
Source of Material.
 In March 1919 Mr. George Willett of Los Angeles visited the Desert in the neighborhood of Palm Springs and Indian Well and made a small but interesting collection of land snails including some live shells of Micrarionta wolcottiana which he kindly turned over to the present writer for study.
A year later Mr. Allyn G. Smith of Redlands and Berkeley made a brief stay in the same region.
He returned with so many interesting specimens including the most remarkable find of living wolcottiana hitherto made that early in April Mr. Smith Mr. .1.
Stanley Ferguson of Redlands and the writer with automobile aid undertook a threeday reconnaissance of the upper end of the desert collections being made at sixteen stations.
Although but ten species of mollusks were taken on this expedition two of these prove to be undescribed and another constitutes a new record for Hie slate of California.
All told six of the ten species are additions to our list of the Desert fauna.
This material now becomes the principal basis of the present paper although a series of specimens received from the California Academy of Sciences through the kindness of Dr. Barton Warren Evermann Director and Mr. W. W. Sargeant Secretary and a specimen kindly given by Mr. C. R. Ghent i are also considered.
I am happy to acknowledge my indebtedness to all these gentlemen as well as to Dr. Emmet Rixford of San Francisco who kindly loaned me some useful comparative material from his own collection.
I am under obligation to Dr. Joseph Grinnell of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology of the University of California for the use of the accompanying outline map.
List of Stations with Data.
 Although collecting was done in three groups of mountains the San Bernardino San Jacinto and Santa Rosa ranges 3 all the localities visited are within the limits of Riverside County California and in the border zone of the Colorado Desert.
On the expedition participated in by the writer land snails were taken at fourteen stations namely Stations I II III IV VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIV XVI and XVII.
Freshwater mollusks were taken at three stations XII XIII and XV.
One station V yielded no collections.
Certain stations which were worked by only one of the party are indicated accordingly.

3 So far as I can discover there is little to be gained by the prevailing recognition of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountain groups as separate ranges.
Palm Canyon or it might be more explicit to say Palm Creek is the only distinguishable boundary between them.
Consequently in clinging to the standard terminology one must accredit all stations east of this creek to the Santa Rcsa west of it to the San Jacintos.

ANNOTATED LIST OF SPECIES.
HELICIDAE Genus MICRARIONTA Ancy 1880 This group long subordinated as a section or subgenus of Distribution of genus Micrarionta in California and western Arizona with special reference to the desert species subgenus Eremarionta indicated by capital letters.
Epiphragmophora has recently been elevated on anatomical grounds to full generic rank by Pilsbry and Ferriss 08 p. 135136 who refer to it not only the typical species found on the southern California coast and islands but also the desert forms of the Colorado basin.
Tentatively admitting the propriety of this arrangement at least until the proper relationship of all the western dartbearing Helices to the more austral true Epiphragmophoras becomes more clear than I believe it to be at present there still seem to exist abundant reasons for a further separation of the two very distinct Californian groups of Micrarionta into subgenera.
All the species known fall easily into one or the other of these the maritime species into Micrarionta s. s. the desert ones into Pilsbry 's group Eremarionia.
Subgenus EREMARIONTA Pilsbry 1913 Shell almost always whitish or pale fawn colored or light brown with a darker band above the periphery.
Spiral sculpture wanting.
Nuclear whorls sculptured with curiously formed elongate papillae sometimes bearing hairlike periostracal projections and arranged in oblique forward slanting lines the radial sculpture being generally relatively inconspicuous.
Type Micrarionta desertorum Pilsbry and Ferriss.
To judge from the nature of the shell characters and especially the details of the embryonic sculpture all the following previously described species seem referable to Eremarionta.
The anatomy however has been investigated by Pilsbry only in the case of the first three Micrarionta desertorum Pilsbry and Ferriss Sonorella wolcottiand Bartsch Micrarionta hutsoni Clapp Epiphragmophora harperi Bryant Sonorella baileyi orcutti Bartsch Helix  'arpenteri var.
Indiocnsis Yates Sonorella argus Edson Micrarionta rixfordi Pilsbry.
To these should logically be added Sonorella baileyi Bartsch and Sonorella fisheri Bartsch which I have not seen and the two new species to be described with perhaps also the Epiphragmophora bmversi Bryant the whole forming a rather weakly differentiated concourse of species entirely confined to the desert regions bordering the Colorado River and its basin in southeastern California and western Arizona.
On the other hand the species of typical Micrarionta are all maritime and in their distribution well separated from the Eremarionta group unless as there are reasons for suspecting the numerous Lower California Helices now generally referred to Sonorella actually prove to be true Eremariontas which would cause the areas inhabited by the two groups slightly to overlap.
So far as at present known Micrarionta s. s. is confined to the islands and adjacent mainland of California and northern Lower California.
The typical section seems now to be restricted to the islands the section Xerarionta alone occuring upon both islands and mainland.
An examination of these maritime forms shows that although subject to much variation in form and sculpture as among themselves so as to fall readily into several fairly well delimited subgroups they all agree in having a nuclear sculpture of simple wavy or anastomosing radial riblets often obsolete but not papillose or only obscurely so and never so far as I ha e been able to discover showing a definite system of elongate papillae as in the desert species.
Eremarionta then is evidently wholly and characteristically Lower Sonoran in a faunal sense.
It is probably also at least in large degree characteristic of what mammalogists and others have denominated the Rupestrine association of that zone.
Possibly both groups will eventually find a place as subgenera of one of the other West American genera.

Shell small thin depressedconic umbilicate the umbilicus deeply permeable its diameter contained about six times in that of the shell.
Whorls four convex subcarinate with deeply channeled sutures the last whorl only slightly descending in front.
Aperture ample obscurely angulate at the periphery strongly oblique its deflection about 40.
Peristome thin sharp not reflected except slightly at the umbilicus its edges strongly converging and connected by a thin parietal callus.
Pcriostracum slightly dehiscent rather harsh and coarse for the size of the shell being roughened not only by the lines of growth but by a very close fine everywhere persistent radial wrinkling and by an overlying system of small papillae which are elongate and so crowded as to be almost anastomosing on the first whorl subsequently becoming more distinct granular in appearance and evidently ranked in fairly well defined forward slanting lines.
Papillae on body whorl show a progressively less regular arrangement until on the base they become smaller and more crowded and their linear arrangement is no longer evident.

Unassuming enough at first glance and even reminding one somewhat of some of the common small land snails of the type of Gonyodiscus or of certain of the lesser Arizonian Oreohelices close inspect 'on reveals this little snail as very distinct from all described American species.
Its harshly shagreened periostracum though furnishing almost its only striking specific character is unlike that of any other snail I have noticed.
This feature is evidently but an elaboration of the type of sculpture so characteristic of the earlier whorls in such species as hutsoni wolcottiana.
Hence it seems appropriate to refer the species at least until its anatomy can be investigated to Eremarionta.
4 All its other features coarse periostracum texture of shell and particularly the conspicuously spotted mantle must be confessed to resemble those of no other Eremarionta which has been described being more like these of some of the species of the Helminthoglypta group.
4 A dissection made by Dr. H. A. Pilsbury sinee this paper went to press has shown this species to possess he usual genitalia of Micrarionta.

The shell of this species has already been well described and figured by Bartsch 03 04a although many more figures will be required to show the remarkable variations to which even the members of a single colony are subject.
Certain anatomical features of taxonomic importance have likewise received treatment at the competent hands of Pilsbry 18.
To the published information the following color notes on the shell and animal may well be added.
The body of the living animal is Chaetura drab passing to drab at the margin and with a narrow stripe of hair brown along the mediodorsal line.
The sole is wood brown shading to avellaneous at the margin.
The shell on the living animal is white on its thicker portions passing through vinaceous buff and intermediate shades to hair brown.
The empty shell of the adult is light in tone the body whorl varying from Tilleul buff to avellaneous paling on the spire to cartridge buff or almost to pinkish buff and in the immediate vicinity of the umbilicus to pale vinaceous fawn or almost white.
The shoulder band usually bordered above and below by a similar band of whitish is quite a dark liver brown often showing a sort of breaking up into two components the d arker one appearing with odd effect to overlie a lighter and brighter one of cinnamon rufous tone Young and immature shells before the formation of the peristome are invariably much darker and brighter in color than the adults the body of the shell a rather light snuff brown toning to avellaneous on the spire and vinaceous buff at the umbilicus.

2 1920 dead One of the principal objects of our expedition of April 1920 was to establish certain facts regarding the range of this most conspicuous of the desert snails.
While its extreme limits were probably not ascertained we collected it at many stations from Station Y1II on the promontory at the mouth of Palm Valley on the east up Palm Canyon and Little Palm Canyon to Stations XI and XIV and thence around Palm Valley via Stations XII IX and IV to Palm Springs and then again at Station XVII on the slope just west of the entrance to Snow Creek Canyon well up into the San Gorgonie Pass.
Mr. Smith had previously collected the species in some numbers in the lower part of Murray Canyon on both slopes and more especially at the mouth of Tahquitz Canyon.
He must have happened on a remarkably favored location at a fortunate time for on the later expedition we failed to meet with living specimens in any numbers anywhere whereas only a week before he had taken over a hundred in the open at the latter locality alone.
On that occasion he found the snails abundant and crawling actively on the surface among big slabs of granite and under bushes on quite a moist slope where they seemed to constitute quite a definite colony.
The time was between 800 and 930 A. M. In Murray Canyon where he had collected the previous afternoon Mr. Smith found dead shells fairly common on both slopes of the canyon along its lower course but live shells were only scattering and mostly to be found under stones indeed only one being found crawling on the surface.
In this canyon he could detect no indication of any association in colonies and we found conditions in Palm.
Canyon altogether similar in this respect.
The slope back of the Palm Springs Hotel which by the way impressed us as by no means the best collecting ground is reputed to be the type locality.
This was our Station IV or at any rate not far from it.
Orcutt '90 p. 67 has already recorded a snail which he collected at Snow Creek Canyon as Helix traskii but at that time the peculiarities of the desert snails were little understood and I think there is small doubt that his shells were really wolcottiana.
The fact that we collected indubitable specimens of the species so near there and actually to the west supports this contention.
True Epiphragmophora traskii is still unknown from the desert drainage.
As is brought out in the table of measurements wolcottiana is an extremely variable species even within the confines of a single circumscribed colony like that found at the mouth of Tahquitz Canyon.
Some are fairly depressed some strongly elevated some large some with less than onehalf the bulk some extremely thin some thick and heavy some with the narrow umbilicus left nearly free others with it entirely closed and so on.
The color of the animal too shows a considerable range of variability though always strikingly different from that for instance of the following species.
On the other hand the shells of adults vary little in color.
Young shells are always much darker and brighter than adults their bright snuff brown color being quite unlike that of any other species of desert snail.
The canyons inhabited by this snail are generally noteworthy for their growth of the palm Neowashingtonia but the palms occur principally in close proximity to the creek bed while the snails inhabit the immediately adjacent slopes.

This very attractive little snail in many respects recalls Pilsbry's description of his Micrarionta rixfordi but the umbilicus is narrower and the sculpturing of the earlier whorls evidently quite different.
As the two species come from different mountain systems with the whole upper Cahuilla Basin between it is doubtful if they are as nearly allied as the descriptions superficially indicate.
To my notion M. hidioensis is really the nearest akin to xerophila of any of those previously described.
Its larger size more elevated outline and narrower umbilicus serve to distinguish it but it is the same general type of shell and it may be that enough intergrades will come to light in intervening territory to reduce M. xerophila to the status of a subspecies.
In fact the small series of snails above noted which Mr. Willett collected to the south of Indian Well may represent one of the intermediate forms as his specimens though surely not all typical of indioensis are yet not quite characteristic of xerophila.
It seems best to refer them to the latter species at least tentatively as the available information regarding the possible limits of variation in all these forms is still very scanty.
The dead shells were either picked up on the surface or from among loose soil and rocks but living ones could be obtained only by digging out the loose detritus in the lee of large rocks following up crevices or turning stones.
They were generally within a few inches of the surface and wherever deeper digging was attempted we met with no success.

This is the longest known of the desert Helices yet does not seem to have been collected many times and I cannot find thai living specimens have ever been taken.
In spite of much exertion we ourselves were no more fortunate than our predecessors in this respect.
The type locality is said to be near Indio  but without doubt this can be emended to south of Indio rather than north as the dead shells found by us in the cove back of Indian Well are except for their slightly smaller size so nearly typical as to indicate I hat the original specimens could not have been collected so very far away.
At this point the steep slope is at the present time very dry supporting only the scantiest vegetation and even dead shells proved difficult to find although occurring scattered loosely on the surface from near the base of the slope to the top of the ridge.
Only 11 fairly good shells was the total catch of the party in an hour or so of work.
This and M. xerophila appear to be species of the Santa Rosa Range they are unknown from the Sau Jacintos.

4767 On a visit to the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco a year or two ago it was a matter of great interest to discover among the material acquired by the Academy from the collection of the late Henry Hemphill a small series of the littleknown Epiphragmophora harperi Bryant evidently authentic since received from Bryant himself.
As the original description was only a short notice of a few lines and nothing further regarding the species was ever published I have ventured to redescribe it and to add figures of the best of the Academy specimens.
More important still it is now possible to give Warner's Hot Springs as the locality perhaps even the original locality where the species was found Bryant having obscurely recorded it as San Jacinto Mts.
Such desscriptions and records surely were better never published as they are sure to lead to misunderstandings and confusion and much laborious research and waste of time to unravel the tangle.
If the present specimens are truly originals the present species can be established as a typical Eremarionta although the peculiarities of the sculpture on the early whorls seem to have been pushed farther than in any other of the described species.
M. orcutti Bartsch however is very close to this and when better material of it can be found it may prove to be identical.
M. xerophila is another somewhat similar species but is smaller has a more lively coloration and the umbilicus is much narrower besides there beingmanifest differences in the embryonic sculpture.
With Bryant's description as far as it goes the specimens examined show fair agreement.
The chief discrepancies are in the number of whorls which he gives as 5 his account of the first three whorls as smooth conceivably because he did not use a sufficiently powerful lens and more disturbingly his description of the peristome as broadly expanded.
He also states that the umbilicus is about onefifth the diameter of the shell.
I am hopeful that he slightly larger size of his type specimen as compared with the present specimens and its evidently more adult condition are sufficient to account for most of the contrariety.

The type locality of this species is given by Bartsch as simply in the Colorado desert.
I once asked Mr. C. R. Orcutt who collected the original specimens if he possessed any more explicit data than this regarding their source.
He informed me that he was no longer entirely certain but believed the specimens described came from near Mountain Springs Imperial County.
If so it ought not to be very difficult to rediscover the species.

In their proportions depressed outline and wide umbilicus the shells of the two forms are very close.

There will however be plenty of time to suggest a name for it after the rediscovery of the type locality enables us to establish whether or not it is really taxonomically distinguishable from M. harperi.

None of the shells is of the typical coastal form nor do they seem exactly referable to the subdolus or rufiterrae types of the San Jacinto and San Bernardino Valleys but the material is insufficient to justify one's saying more.

KEELEYITE A NEW LEAD SULFANTIMONITE FROM ORURO BOLIVIA.
By Samuel G. Gordon.
The Oruro district of Bolivia has long been known to mineralogists by the excellent crystals of andorite stannite and other rare minerals which the mines have produced.
The present paper is descriptive of a new lead sulfantimonite keeleyite which was obtained on the VauxAcademy Andean Expedition of 1921.
The silvertin mines of Oruro are situated in the hills at the western edge of the town and are three in number the Socavon the San Jose and the Itos.
The keeleyite was obtained at the San Jose mine.
The oreveins are essentially pyritic bodies forming fissure fillings in a quartzporphyry and the dark Paleozoic slates into which the porphry has been intruded.
The principal minerals are pyrite lightbrown massive cassiterite tetrahedrite and jamesonite.
Andorite and stannite are extremely rare.
The exact mode of occurrence of the keeleyite is not known as the single specimen brought back was obtained at the cancha of the mine.
This specimen measuring 3 X 5 X 7 inches is a mass of cavernous quartz studded with small white quartz crystals.
The cavities contain sheaflike aggregates of acicular crystals of keeleyite some pyrite and an undetermined sulfide.
General Description.
Keeleyite is dark gray in color and gives a grayishblack streak.
The luster of the mineral is bright metallic.
The hardness is about 2.
The specific gravity was determined in H 2 Oin a 5 cc.
pycnometer and gave the value 5.21 .
The mineral occurs in aggregates usually radiating of acicular crystals which may measure an inch in length.
The crystals are deeply striated and furrowed due in part perhaps to parallel growth.
No measurable crystals were found but the mineral is probably orthorhombic.
Keeleyite fuses at 1 and gives the same reactions before the blowpipe etc. as the other lead sulfantimonites.
A white sublimate of antimony oxide is obtained by heating in the closed tube while dense white fumes are obtained in the open tube.
The mineral is almost entirely volatilized on charcoal with the formation of a 101 102 Vol.
LXXIV coating which is yellowish near the assay and white farther out.
Globules of lead are obtained by reduction with soda in the R. F. Composition.
A preliminary determination of lead gave 27.78 Pb.
A complete analysis shown in Table I was then made by Dr. J. Edward Whitfield on 1.25 grams of carefully selected acicular crystals.
It was impossible to free the needles from some sulfides and quartz.
The loss of 1.18 in the analysis is due to the latter mineral.
Column II shows the analysis after deducting 8.15 sulphides and recalculating to 100.
The ratios of the constitutents are shown in column III and approximate Pb  Sb  S  2611 corresponding to Pb
