NOTES ON THE ORTHOPTERA OF COSTA RICA WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN The following notes and descriptions are based on a study of over three hundred and fifty specimens representing one hundred species of which eleven are here described as new.
This material is distributed through the collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia the United States National Museum and the private collection of Mr. Morgan Hebard of Chestnut Hill Philadelphia.
The writer is much indebted to Prof. P. Biolley of San Jose Costa Rica who courteously supplied some very valuable material accompanied by full notes and remarks and also to Dr. William H. Ashmead of the United States National Museum and Mr. Hebard for permission to study the collections mentioned above.
The number of records here ublished which extend the range of species is rather remarkable and clearly shows the lack of definite information regarding the Orthoptera of northern South America.
The Forficulidae Blattidse Mantidse Phasmidse and Acrididse of the greater portion of these collections have already been studied and reported by the author. Family BLATTIDJE.

As far as can be determined from the broken male figured and described by Westwood this appears to be the same species.
It is however somewhat smaller and has the antennae longer than in Westwood's figme and equal to the body in length instead of reaching rather beyond the middle of the metathorax.
The species of the genus Bostra in hand for study are four incomptn Rehn jaliscensis Rehn' jugalis Rehn and turgida Westwood.
The males of all these species are now before me and can be separated by the following key a.
 Cerci not exceeding the subgenital opercule proper i.e. the eighth ventral segment in length.
b.
 Ninth dorsal abdominal segment somewhat bullate the caudal margin bilobate with the median emargination subtrigonal.
Subgenital opercule without a distinct clawlike process.
c.  Median segment in length not exceeding onehalf the remaining portion of the metanotmn.
Cerci slightly tapering B. turgida Westw..

Stal's B. dorsuariri' and Scudder's B. exigua are known from the males while B. remiformis Rehn is based on the female sex.
The latter has the median segment twothirds the length of the metanotum itself which fact would associate it with jaliscensis inco7npta and jugalis.
As the female of jugalis is known it is certainly not that species while the other two species are very much larger in the male sex than the female type of remiformis.
Accordingly I think it a good species of which the male is unknown.

This specimen also has the tegmina and wings shorter than in the Tablazo specimens and similar in this respect to individuals from Tacubaya Mexico which appear to be referable to P. excelsus Bruner.

The sulcation of the frontal costa appears deeper than in viridifasciata instead of shallower but as the specimen in hand appears to have been in alcohol preparation may have caused this.
Several races of C. viridifasciata of value equal to this exist in the United States.

These specimens are referred here with some little doubt.
They are unquestionably closely allied to H. sumichrasti but have the fast'igium broader and shallower than in that species while the frontal costa is broader and has a slight constriction ventrad of the ocellus.
The two in hand are larger than Guadalajara and Jalapa individuals of sumichrasti.
and about equal in size to a female from Alta Iira Tamaulipas. 
This locality is between Punta Arenas and the mouth of the Rio Grande de Tar coles.

As far as can be determined from the descriptions these specimens appear referable to this species but probably will represent a closely allied form when compared with typical Surinam individuals.
The lateral bars are not sharply separated from the winecolor of the dorsum but present a strong contrast with the yellowish of the ventral portions.
The genus Cornops as defined by StaPappear to agree better with these specimens than does Scudder's description.
This may be due to the fact that Stal's description was based on longipenne.

This form is probably as Brunner says a small type of tessellata.
The large series examined is rather uniform in size but the coloration varies greatly both in the general color and the presence or intensity of the fuscous annuli of the tegmina.
Most of the males have the tambourine marked laterad more or less regularly with brownish and the paler specimens which are little marked with fuscous have the femoral spines with the dark color restricted to a very slight apical touch.
The previous Costa Rican records of this species are from San Jose La Uruca El Coronal Tucurrique La Palma Turrialba and Monte Redondo.

The material examined fully demonstrates the variability of this species in color some being strongly dotted with fuscous and with the usual large annuli distinct while others are almost uniform green.
Considerable variation is also exhibited in size and some individuals might be referred to either tessellatus or conspersus.
This is particularly true of the individuals from Carrillo.

This series exhibits considerable variation in size and a slight amount in color but in this regard chiefly in the strength of the greenish suffusion of the tegmina.
In a few specimens the tegmina are somewhat tessellated by the infuscation of veins but usually this is not pronounced.
The pronotum is in several specimens rather dark while the cingulate margin is light colored producing a decided contrast.
The most striking variation however is in size one male and several females being considerably smaller than the types of their respective sexes.

This specimen presents some points of difference from the description of spiniger and may represent the female of E. longipennis Redtenbacher from Costa Rica known only from the male but that species is said to have the mesoet metasternum lobis rotundatis while the specimen in hand has the lateral margins of the mesosternum elevated and developed into rather blunt flattened spines.
On the other hand the fastigium is flattened above while in spiniger this is superne hand deplanatum and in longipennis superne planum.
The ovipositor is typical of spiniger.
This species was previously known only from the type locality.

These specimens appear to represent this long unrecognized species.
Superficially the coloration resembles species of the genus Amphiacusta.
but the peculiar rostrum and slenderer limbs readily differentiate it.
The anal filaments are very long considerably exceeding the ovipositor.
The coloration of the limbs is very rich the caudal femora being winecolor with one complete and one broken distal annulus of ochre.

These specimens are referred questionally to this species on account of the form of the terminal joints of the palpi which are exactly as in O. tibialis and not the funnelshaped type found in cayennensis.
On the other hand the male tegmina are not as in tibialis but are typical of cayennensis and the proportions also agree with the latter species.

It is with some doubt that I place this specimen under this species as it differs considerably in color and has the caudal femora slightly smaller than Saussure's measurements.
The caudal metatarsi have very well developed spines but Saussure says they are  enormes.
The head except the eyes rostrum and antennal fossa pronotum and cephalic and median limbs are blackishbrown while the tegmina are sienna.
The specimen apparently fits no other species but may be quite distinct from the true silens.

Coon Mountain and its Crater.
 Dr. Dixon announced that Mr. Daniel Moreau Barringer and Mr. Benjamin Chew Tilghman members of the Academy had notified him of their discovery that the crater of Coon Mountain or Coon Butte in northern Arizona twelve miles southeast of Cailon Diablo Station on the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railway is an impact crater and not a crater produced by a steam explosion as has been supposed since the examination made of it by members of the United States Geological Survey.
They have proved by a large amount of development work according to their statements that the large crater and elevation known as Coon Mountain is the result of a collision with the earth of a veiy large meteorite or possibly a small asteroid fragments of which are well known to the scientific world by the name of the Canon Diablo siderites.
Their development work consisting of cuts shafts and boreholes has established the following facts First.
That the formation of the crater and the deposition of the meteoric material were simultaneous.
Second.
That meteoric material has been found five hundred feet below the surface of the center of the crater and Third.
That sandstone supposed to be in place exists less than one thousand feet below the surface of the center of the crater.
Mr. Barringer and Mr Tilghman have presented to the Academy for publication two comprehensive papers in which they set forth in full their reasons for the above statements.
Dr. Henry Skinner made a communication on his collecting trip of last summer to the Huachuca Mountains Arizona.
