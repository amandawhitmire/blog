BY EDGAR F. SMITH.
Ten years ago, the late Ex-Congressman D. B. Brunner and Dr. Schoenfeld, of Reading, Pa., placed in my hands a number of minerals which they gathered from a railroad cut east of Reading.
Considerable blasting had been done and a great deal of rock material had been removed.
It was upon pieces of this rock and in its crevices that they obtained the minerals which I was to examine at my leisure and analyze if I cared so to do.
At intervals these minerals have been submitted for study in the laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania, with results that have been more or less interesting.

FLORA OF THE C0N0WING0 BARRENS OF SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA BY FRANCIS W. PEXNELL.
During the summers of 1908 and 1909 the writer was enabled to spend considerable time in the stud}' of the flora of the Conowingo or Serpentine Barrens lying in Chester and Delaware Counties, Pennsylvania.
Nearly all the areas in these counties were visited, in most cases repeatedly, and full collections made.
The writer has also been able to examine the material in the herbaria of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Botanical Club, and the University of Pennsylvania.
The object of this paper is to present accurate data as to the species composing the flora of the barrens.
Effort has been made to make the list of species accurate and complete, while less attention for the present has been paid to the ecological grouping and adaptations of the flora.
The general conditions of the environment — climate, physiography and soil — will, however, be considered, and a sketch of the flora and its affinities presented.
In the prosecution of this study the writer acknowledges the courtesy of the custodians of the herbaria named, and especially that of S. S. Van Pelt and Witmer Stone, to whose interest he is indebted for much aid in the determination of species.
Also to Agnes Chase, of the United States Department of Agriculture, is he indebted for determinations in the genus Panicum.
Climate.
The climate of this district, as taken from the reports of the Weather Bureau stations at West Chester and Kennett Square, shows the general condition prevailing throughout the Middle Atlantic States.
The average temperature for January is 30° F.: for July 74° F. ; the average first killing frost of autumn is on October 19, the last of spring on April 16; the precipitation is relatively even and well diffused throughout the year, reaching a total average annual rainfall of 50 inches.
Thus it may be seen that the growing season is of considerable length, warm and well supplied with moisture.
The xerophytic character of the Conowingo flora is not the result of the climate.
512 proceedings of the academy of [oct., Physiography axd Soil.
The Conowingo, or Serpentine, Barrens occur as small isolated areas, stretching in a much broken chain near the coastward edge of the Piedmont Plateau from New England to North Carolina.
In Pennsylvania they lie in a hilly, much eroded country, and, owing to the chemical stability of serpentine rock, occur usually on crests and as low ridges.
Their geologic structure is striking and has been frequently described.
1 Their soil has been lately described in several publications of the Division of Soils of the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
2 In these the name Conowingo Barrens is consistently applied, which has led to its adoption in the present paper.
Two types of soil are derived from the weathering of the Serpentine — itself a soft, green, altered igneous rock: the Conowingo Barrens and the Conowingo clay.
( )f these the latter represents a much decomposed soil of considerable depth and forms a transition between the Conowingo Barrens.
and the normal mellow soils of the district.
The Conowingo Barrens are alone considered here.
"The soil (of the Conowingo Barrens) generally is a light yellow or whitish-looking loam, but in places it is almost black.
The top soil occasionally has a depth of 8 or 10 inches, and it is underlain by a yellowish-brown subsoil to.
a depth of 36 inches.
The soil is generally much shallower, and in the case of the barren hills of this formation the rocks are devoid of any trace of soil covering except that caught in the pockets and crevices of the rocks.
Frequently even on level or lightly rolling areas the soil may not exceed a few inches in depth.
These soils, as seen from the mechanical analyses of samples collected, are not essentially different from man}' of the productive upland soils, but they are unproductive, and in extreme cases will not produce anything in a natural state except a stunted growth of small pines and knotty oak trees.
At the best they are stubborn and unproductive, and although many reasons have been assigned for their sterility none seem altogether satisfactory.
Professor Merrill (Rocks, Eockweathering, and Soils.
1897) in speaking of the Chester County Barrens says that these soils are derived from the slow decomposition of peridotites, rocks rich in iron-magnesium silicates, but almost wholly 1 See (a) Maryland Geol.
Survey, Cecil Co. Report; (6) Penna.
2d Geol.
Surv., Chester Co. Report; (c) Philadelphia Geol.
Folio, 1909.
-See (a) Man/land Geol.
Survey, Cecil Co. Report; (b) Harford Co. Report (c) U. S. Div.
of Soils, Chester Co., Penna., Report.
lacking in lime, potash or other desirable constituents.
Hence the soils derived from such rocks are naturally devoid of nutrient matter and can support only a scanty growth of grass and stunted shrubs.
The main reason which may be assigned for their unproductiveness is the large amount of magnesia which they contain and their slight depth.
The analyses of these soils show that they contain very minute quantities of lime and phosphoric acid."
3 The Conowingo Barrens are rarely, if ever, cultivated; even for pasturage or for timber they are of little practical value.
They have thus remained very nearly in their original condition.
On all sides, however, they shade into the more tractable clay formation, which is frequently cleared and cultivated.
In Delaware and Chester Counties, as may be seen on the maps, the Barrens lie in two main divisions : to the northeast they are small and scattered (Chester Group), to the southwest they form essentially one long continuous area (State-line Barrens).
In the former are some 10 or 12 well-marked exposures, ranging from less than one-half acre (e.g., Sconnelltown) to such as the Serpentine Ridge, three to four miles long.
These areas lie near together in extreme southern Montgomery, Delaware, southeastern Chester Counties, Pennsylvania, and northwestern Newcastle County, Delaware.
They are separated some twenty miles from the nearest point of the State-line Barrens.
The latter extends as one ridge, some thirty-five miles long, with a width of one to three miles, trending west-southwest from Little Elk Creek, Chester County, Pennsylvania, through northern Cecil County, Maryland, and over the Susquehanna River into Harford County, Maryland.
With this area are allied smaller side areas in southern Lancaster County.
Pennsylvania, near the Conowingo Creek.
Most of the field-work of this study is concerned with the Chester group of Barrens, practically every area of which in Delaware and Chester Counties has been visited.
The State-line Barrens have been but twice visited, on both occasions in August, and the route traversed from Nottingham Station to Goat Hill near Octoraro Creek.
As the barrens in this section are known as the Nottingham Barrens, this more local name will be used in reporting specimens.
The areas from which specimens have been examined are: 3 C. W. Dorsey and J.

Composition of Flora.
Throughout these areas, and doubtless far beyond on either side, the flora of the Conowingo Barrens is strikingly uniform, yet strikingly in contrast with that of the surrounding district.
The latter originally was everywhere mesophytic woodland, on the Barrens the change is made to a xerophytic woodland, and over considerable areas to no woodland at all.
Though other xerophytic areas, as notably the South Valley and North Valley Hills to the north or the dry sandy barrens of New Jersey across the Delaware River to the south and east, lie not far away, the flora of the Conowingo Barrens is quite distinct.
Yet the flora of these barrens is not uniform.
Situated like islets in the midst of the surrounding vegetation, probably never interconnected, it is interesting to note that species will occur and be quite prevalent or even predominant on one, yet be quite scarce or not present at all on another.
This local variation is most pronounced between the floras of the Chester and State-line groups.
In the general sketch now presented only the features common or nearly common to all the main exposures will be given.
Local differences and geographic notes on the component features will be considered later .
The upland barrens are mostly covered by a sparse growth of timber of markedly xerophytic type.
Quercus stellata is abundant on all barrens, Quercus marylandica on most, while with these on the State-line Barrens Pinus rigida becomes a predominant tree.
Associated with these may occur Sassafras sassafras, Acer rubrum and Prunus serotina (the latter two usually in a stunted condition).
The round bushy growth of the thick-leaved oaks, with open park-like spaces between, is the characteristic feature of this woodland.
It is but a step from this type of woodland to that where the open predominates, then to where on the barest ridges there is but scant covering above the rock for any growth whatever.
In such exceedingly shallow soil, usually a greenish sand with fine portions of Serpentine and talc rock interspersed, there is a scattered growth of thin grasses, Aristida cliehotoma, A. gracilis, and Sporobolus vaginceflorus, with the nearly equally delicate Polygonum tenue and Aster parviceps pusillus.
It is here, locally, that Talinum teretifolium is found.
In slightly deeper soil, or on rock-ledges, Arabis lyrata, Asclepias verticillata, J uncus secundus and Panicum philadelphicum become predominant plants.
Here Arenaria stricta is noteworthy as a local plant.
In all these the xerophytic habit is marked, mostly taking the form of reduced, narrow or involute leaves, in Talinum teretifolium of succulency; in Arabis lyrata the entire growth is made in the relatively moist spring season.
Scarcely less xerophytic is the herbaceous growth in the numerous park-like openings mentioned.
Grasses and sedges form the bulk of the vegetation.
Andropogon scoparius (both brown and purplish forms), Panicum philadelphicum, P. spharocarpon, Aristida cliehotoma, A. gracilis, and Scleria pauciflora are abundant, while constant, but individually less numerous, are Sorghastrum nutans, Paspalum pubescens, Syntherisma filiformis, Panicum annulum, P. huachucce silricola, P. scribnerianum, Aristida purpurascens, Sporobolus vaginaflorus, Danthonia spicata, Eragrostis pectinacea, Cyperus filiculmis macilentus, Car ex triceps hirsuta and Car ex glaucodea.
Other constant herbs of the dry open barrens are Juncus secundus, Sisyrinchium mucronatum, Comandra umbellata, Polygonum tenue, Cerastium oblongifolium, Arabis lyrata, Saxifraga virginiensis , Potentilla pumila, Hypericum punctatum, Helianthemum majus, Viola fimbriatula (S).
(Serpentine form), Angelica villosa, Sabbedia angularis, Asdepias verticillcda, Koelliei ffexuosa, Houstonia ccerulea, Lobelia spicata.
Eupatorium aromaticum, Solidago nemoralis.
Aster ericoides, A. parviceps pusillus, A. lateriflorus, Antennaria neglecta, A. plantaginifolia, and Senecio bedsamita.
Where the trees are somewhat closer together and over much of the intervening area there is a shrubby growth forming dry upland thicket.
Salix tristis, Corylus americana, Rhus glabra, Ceanothus americana, Gaylussacia baccata, ~\'accinium medians are predominant, while frequent with these are Quercus diet folia.
Q. prinoides, Rosa hum ills, Rhus copallina, Xolisma ligustrina and Polycodium stamincum.
Large areas of the open, and especially about depressions, are covered with an abundant growth of greenbrier, mainly Smilax rotundifolia, though accompanied by S. glauea.
Juniperus virginiana is the main tree of such depressions, and the densest growth of Smilax usually occurs beneath it.
Acer rubrum here becomes a tree of considerable size.
In the dry upland thicket and open woodland, and about the edge of these cedar-greenbrier thickets, the vegetation is decidedly more mesophytic, most of the species here being common to the surrounding district.
In the woodland occur PJiegopteris hexagonoptera, Panicum dichotomum, P. boscii, L/inum virginianum, Dasystoma flava, Gerardia tenuifolia, Hierdcium venosum, Nabalus serpentarius, Solidago bicolor and Sericocarpus asteroides.
Many other species of the surroundingflora are more or less casual here.
In the greenbrier thicket and about its edge grow man}' herbs, of which Andropogon furcatus, Seirpus atrovirens, Sdene steUata, Vernonia noveboracensis, Eupatorium perfoliatum, Solidago rugosa, Helianthus giganteus and Cirsium muticum may be mentioned as constant and frequent.
Beneath the dense shade of the cedars and greenbrier and on banks of small streamlets PolysUchum aerostichoides, Asplenia m p'aty neuron, Homedocenchrus virginicus, Agrostis perennans, Aretbis lyrata, Saxijraga virginiensis occur with other species of the open dry barrens in ranker growth.
Where depressions exist free from the covering of thicket or trees, especially where, though not wet in summer, complete desiccation seldom occurs, where the soil is largely a greenish sand, but not dry or arid, a peculiar vegetation exists.
Deschampsia ceespitosa and Fimbristylis laxa occur here, with locally Cassia ehamaerista, Cyperus aristatus, and Gerardia purpurea parvulu.
Between the upland xerophytic woodland and the surrounding mesophytic forest the change, sometimes abrupt, is usually gradual.
Of the trees Quercus stellata, Q. marylandica and Pin us rigida do not pass beyond the limits of the Serpentine, and over any extended view may be taken to indicate its position.
But Sassafras sassafras, Acer rubrum and Nyssa sylvatica pass beyond, Quercus alba, Castanea dentata and Quercus velutina come successively into prominence, though not till the barrens are left does Liriodendron tulipifera become a predominant forest tree.
The flora of one other plant-association was noted, though only partially.
In the rich swamps at the base of the hills, derived mainly from the washing of the barren soil, there is a varied and abundant vegetation.
Mostly this is the normal swamp-flora of the surrounding district, but a few species seem constantly present here which are much less frequently seen elsewhere.
Such are Osmunda spectabilis, Spiraea latifolia, Sanguisorba canadensis and Heliopsis helianthoides.
The local variations of this flora are considerable.
The isolation of the different areas, the meagre size of some, the nearness of some to one or another barren of a different type, all tend to modify the flora.
Yet the above characteristic species remain remarkably constant.
Because of its large continuous area the State-line Barrens probably better illustrate the complete flora of the type than any other.
Pin us rigida, Sporobolus heterolepis, Ascyrum hypericoides, Pieris mariana, Galium boreale, and Eupatorium pubescens were found here only, while Quercus marylandica , Cassia chamcecrista , and Acerates riridiflora present here are very local in the Chester group.
The distance separating the two groups of barrens makes the distinction between them the most important variation in the flora.
It is impossible from the meagre information as to the Nottingham flora to speak with certainty of what plants present in the Chester Group are absent in the State-line group.
The following species of the former have not been noted in the latter, Atheropogon curtijx ndulus, Deschampsia ccespitosa, Cyperus aristatus, Carex bicknellii and Scutellaria parvula ambigua.
In the Chester Group the variation is mostly in accessory noncharacteristic species.
The only general division which can be made is between the relatively deeper-soiled barrens of Delaware County and the bare rocky ridges frequent in southeastern Chester County.
On the latter only occur Atheropogon curtipendulus, Talinum teretifolium and Arenaria stricta, on the former Quercus marylandica and likely Lilium philadelphicum.
Many other notable species occur irregularly or in but one or t\\ o areas.
Of commoner species Phlox subulata is a conspicuous instance.
Of scarcer species may be mentioned Pinus virginiana, Ari&tida oligantha, Sphcnopholis obtusata pubescens, Aletris farinosa.
Meihomia rigida, Sarothra gentianoides, Viola pedata lineariloba, Gentiana crinita, Phlox pilosa, Scutellaria pamila airibigua, Gerard ia purpurea parvula, Castilleia coccinea, Lonicera semperrirens, Lacinaria spicata, Aster patens and Antennaria neodioica.
Geographical Affinities of the Flora.
The following list shows 217 species composing the characteristic flora of the Conowingo Barrens, while some 77 others were collected occasionally.
Of the characteristic species 17 in this section of the Piedmont area are quite or nearly confined to these barrens, while 4 s others occur mainly here.
The remainingspecies belong to the normal flora of the district, and their distribution will be less considered.
-Many of the species occurring mainly on the Conowingo Barrens occur also on other barren (xerophytic) formations of the district, as the South Valley Hill (shale) and the North Valley Hill (quartzite and sandstone).
Among such may be mentioned Panicum philadelphicum, P. depaupcratum, P. scribnerianum, P. sphwrocarpon, Aristida gracilis, Juncus secundus, Smilax glauca, S. rotundifolia, Sisyrinchium mucronaium, Quereus dieifolia, Q. stellata.
Q. prinoides, Comandra umbellata, Polygonutn tenue, Lespedeza capitata, L. virginica, Angelica villosa, and Senecio balsamitce.
A common dry light soil accounts for such distribution.
Across the Delaware River in New Jersey, also in southern Delaware, lie the sand barrens of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.
From here have evidently been derived a number of coastal (Carolinian) species.
Besides all the above list of xerophytes, Pinus virginiana, P. rigida, Aristida oligantha, A. purpurascens, Scleria triglomerata , Quereus marylandica, Cassia chamarrista, Strophostyles umbelleda, Asclepias verticillata, Phlox subidata, Eupatorium aromaticum are species present to both floras.
Other less characteristic species showing coastal influence are Typha angustifolia, Panicum commonsianum, P. addisonii, Juncus aristulatus, Aletris farinosa and Pieris mariana.
Fimbristylis laxa.
though not found in New Jersey, likewise seems to imply a coastward southern influence.
Distinctive species in the characteristic Conowingo flora showing a northern or Alleghanian influence are Sporobolus heterolepis, Deschaynpsia ca'spitosa.
Atheropogon cvrtipendulus, Carex glaucodea, C. bieknellii, Lilium philadelphicum , Quercus Uicifolia, Arenaria stricta, and Galium boreale.
Of these Sporobolus heterolepis, Deschampsia ccespitosa, Carex bieknellii and Galium boreale here reach their most southerly recorded stations in the Eastern States.
The species in this district restricted to the Conowingo Barrens are Panicum annulum, Sporobolus heterolepis, Sphenopholis obtusata pubescens, Deschampsia ccespitosa, Atheropogon curtipendulus, Fimbristylis laxa, Carex bieknellii, Quercus marylandica, Talinum teretifolium, Cerastium oblongifolium, Arenaria stricta, Asclepias verticillata , Phlox subidata, Scutellaria parvula ambigua, Gerardia purpurea parvula, and Aster parviceps pusillus.
Of these most are wide-ranging and have been considered.
Of those remaining, Panicum annulum, Sphenopholis obtusata pubescens, and Scutellaria parvula ambigua seem very local here and occur in areas widely remote over most of the Eastern States.
Talinum teretifolium, Cerastium oblongifolium and Aster parviceps pusillus in the East, at least, are practically confined to magnesian (i.e., Serpentine) soil.
Aster parviceps pusillus, common here, is only known from the Serpentine Barrens of a small area in southern Pennsylvania and adjacent West Virginia.
Cerastium oblongifolium and Talinum teretifolium range west to Minnesota and Colorado / and toward the western part of their range are adapted to other xerophytic habitats.
The range of Gerardia purpurea parvula is not as yet understood.

RECORDS OF GEORGIA AND FLORIDA ORTHOPTERA, WITH THE DESCRIPTIONS OF ONE NEW SPECIES AND ONE NEW SUBSPECIES.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN AND MORGAN HEBARD.
The following records are based almost entirely on material belonging to the collection of the State of Georgia contained in the State House at Atlanta.
This series was submitted to us for examination through the kind services of Mr. J. Chester Bradley, of Cornell University, who collected a large proportion of the specimens.
Where no collection is indicated in the following pages the material belongs to the State series, and unless otherwise stated the localities given are in Georgia.
A considerable proportion of the species here treated are recorded for the first time from Georgia or Florida, while our knowledge of several of the species has until this date rested on but one or two records.
The new Choriopiutga is a rather widely distributed form in the Gulf region, while the new Nemobius is apparently a localized type.
DERM AFTER A. LABIIDiE.
Labia minor (Linna?us).
Atlanta, September 19, 1908.
One male.
This species has been recorded from Thomasville.
1 Labia burgessii Scudder.
Brunswick, April 8.

The United States records for this species, aside from one from Massachusetts no doubt due to accidental introduction, are all from southern and eastern Georgia and Florida and central Alabama.
Anisolabis annulipes (H. Lucas).
St. Simon's Island, September 8, 1904.
One female.
Tybee Island, June 30 (Dr. D. M.
Castle.)
One male, one female.

[Acad.

This species is closer related to C. cubensis than to C. viridijasciata and C. mcridionalis, differing from cubensis in the following particulars: the male sex has the fastigium less excavate, the eyes less prominent, the caudal portion of the disk of the prozona less bullate and the median carina of the pronotum more uniformly elevated and less broadly severed: the female has the median carina of the pronotum more arcuate and very narrowly severed, the caudal femora slenderer and the form more compressed (in this respect resembling viridijasciata).
From C. viridijasciata the new form differs in the less strongly keel-like median carina of the pronotum, in the less acute angle of the caudal margin of the pronotum, in the broader fastigium and in the markedly different color pattern, which is essentially that of C. cubensis.
Size medium; form moderately compressed.
Head with the occiput moderately arcuate; fastigium considerably declivent, acuteangulate cephalad, the very narrow apex passing into the frontal costa, the male having the cephalic angle much sharper and the fastigial width much less than in the female, the latter with the width slightly more than the length, disk slightly excavated; lateral foveolse trigonal, not excavate; facial outline nearly straight (cT) or slightly arcuate ( 9 ), subangulate with the fastigium in the male, rounded in the female; frontal costa rather narrow, considerably constricted dorsad of the insertion of the antennae, slightly so ventrad of the same, moderately expanding toward the clypeal suture, sulcate for a distance ventrad of the ocellus, punctate dorsad; eyes rather prominent in the male, hardly so in the female, reniform-ovate in shape, the length subequal to ( 9 ) or slightly exceeding (cT) that of the infra1 Probably the following refer to tins species: 1904.

— Chortophaga australior n.sp.
Lateral outline of head and pronotum of female type.
(X2.)
ocular sulcus; antennae subdepressed, the apex more so than the proximal and median portions and very slightly expanded.
Pronotum with the median carina considerably elevated, subcristate, not or slightly arcuate cephalocaudad, the intersection of the principal sulcus being very appreciable, though not deeply severing the crest; lateral carinac irregular, composed chiefly of tubercles, broken mesad; cephalic margin of the disk obtuse-angulate, caudal margin of the disk rectangulate to slightly acute-angulate; lateral lobes with the greatest depth about equal to the greatest length.
Tegmina surpassing the tips of the caudal femora by about the length of the head, rather broad, obliquely rotundato-truncate at the apex; intercalary vein proximad very close to the ulnar vein, mesad equidistant from the ulnar and median veins.
Interspace between the mesosternal lobes subquadrate in the male, slightly transverse in the female; metasternal lobes with an extremely narrow interspace in the male, the interspace subquadrate in the female.
Caudal femora more robust in the female than in the male, the greatest width contained three and one-half times in the length in the male, three times in the female.
Green Phase.
— Head, pronotum, pleura, caudal femora, a longitudinal bar on the medio-proximal portion of the tegmina, a median, and a costal premedian patch on the same apple-green ; remainder of tegmina and venter brownish, the venter inclined toward raw umber, the sutural half of the tegmina mars-brown with a pattern of obsolete darker maculations, blending into the clove-brown areas on the costal half of the tegmina.
Dorsum of the caudal femora marked with median, premedian and preapical patches of clove-brown, the median the largest and triangular in shape, the markings being placed in juxtaposition to clove-brown areas on the tegmina; ventral faces of the caudal femora black with two whitish bands, one median and the other preapical, genicular region clove-brown; caudal tibiae glaucous, the genicular extremity clove-brown with a patellar spot of pale greenish and a broad complete yellowish-white annulus, spines yellowish with black tips; caudal tarsi pale ochraceous.

Brown Phase.
— Similar to the green phase except that the green of the latter is replaced with clay color, ochraceous or ochraceous-buff, much marked with clove-brown on the head, pronotum and pleura, and usually with a more or less distinct paler decussate pattern on the dorsum of the pronotum, the lateral lobes of the pronotum more r less striate cephalo-caudad with dark color.
Measurements.
Length of body 18 mm.
24.5 mm.
Length of pronotum 4.5 " 6 Greatest width of pronotum (disk) 3 4 Length of tegmen 18 " 21.5 " Length of caudal femur 12 " 13.8 " Considerably over a hundred specimens of this species have been examined by us in the past few years and the species shares the characters of Chortophaga and Encoptolophus to such an extent that the above synonym can be explained on that ground.
It appears that the species replaces C. viridifasciata in at least the extreme southeastern part of the country ranging as far as known from Thomasville and Waynesville, Ga., south to Apalachicola, Miami, Chokoloskee and Key West.
Its range probably meets that of C. viridifasciata in southcentral Georgia as we have seen the latter from Marshallville in that region.
No doubt the references to C. viridifasciata from the region frequented by the new form will on the examination of the material prove to belong to australior.
The species is known to us from the following material : St. Simon's Island, Ga. September 9, 1909.

This form shows no constant structural difference to separate it from the more northern palustris, but a series of fourteen individuals of both sexes all agree in being most strikingly colored, quite distinct in this respect from true palustris.
The new form has the head and pronotum ochraceous-rufous, the limbs almost uniform ochraceous and the tegmina shining black or brownish-black.
The contrasting coloration is quite distinctive and varies but little in tone in the series.
At the present time it seems best to regard aurantius as a form of palustris, although it may at some future date be shown to be worthy of specific rank.

LITTLE KNOWN NEW JERSEY FISHES.
BY HENRY W. FOWLER.
The following notes on rare or neglected fishes from New Jersey, are based on material now in the Academy, unless otherwise stated.
I have also mentioned some others to show interesting associations.
Alopias vulpes (Gmelin).
One was reported taken off Atlantic City on May 14, said to have been 15 feet long.
Not in the Academy.
Eulamia obscura (Le Sueur).
I examined the jaws of an example, now in the New Jersey State Museum and evidently this species, taken at Perth Amboy in 1850, submitted to me by Mr. S. R. Morse.
Squatina squatina (Linnaeus).
The first record of this fish is in 1847, from Delaware Bay, 1 and an old dried skin in the collection of the Academy, without data, is very likely the original specimen.
It has also been recorded from Atlantic City.
2 Dasyatis say (Le Sueur).
One taken at Barnegat in August by Mr. R. B. Farley proves to be this species.
Acipenser sturio Linnaeus.
A large example was taken, in a net, in the Delaware River at Beverly late in August.
Not in the Academy.
Tarpon atlanticus (Valenciennes).
The first record for this species is by Baird, who says, in 1874, it has "been noted as occurring more or less frequently along the coast of New Jersey."
3 An example, said to have weighed 120 poinds, was reported from Seabright later, 4 and the same record says "several reported between Cape May and Fire Island in the past ten years."

Ameiums natalis prosthistius (Cope).
Mr. J. F. Street se .aired an example in the Rancocas Creek at New Lisbon, in Burlington County, on September 11, which is the first instance of its occurrence in the Delaware River valley.
He also found some very dark examples of Abramis crysoleucas at the same time, though they were not preserved.
Fundulus luciae (Baird).
Dr. R. J. Phillips and the writer found this species in some numbers in the salt ponds at Corson's Inlet, on April 3, associated with F. heteroclitus macrolepidotus, Cyprinodon variegatus and Gasterosteus aculeatus.
They were usually found with the killies, though prawns and pursy minnows were occasionally their only companions.
Lucania parva (Baird).
I found this little fish abundant with F. heteroclitus macrolepidotus at Manasquan Inlet on July 19, also associated with Anguilla chrisypa, Cyprinodon variegatus and Menidia beryllina cerea.

The latter is the most northern stream in which I have yet noted it.
In Fishing Creek it was not found, though Abramis crysoleucas, Umbra pygmcea, Aphredoderus sayanus, Enneacanthus obesus and Eupomotis gibbosus were common.
Exocoetus volitans Linnaeus.
Dr. H. Tucker found 2 examples on the beach at Cape May City during the past August.
Though these specimens were in bad condition and not preserved, Dr. Tucker is ceitain of their identity with Atlantic specimens in the collection.
Fistularia tabacaria Linnaeus.
A small example was taken September 3, at Ocean City, by Mr. D. .McCadden, with numbers of Fundulus majalis, Menidia menidia notata, Mugil curema.
Hippocampus hudsonius, Trachinotus carolinus, Orthopristis ckrysopterus, Stenotomus chrysops, Menticirrhus saxatilis, Spheroidcs maculatus, Prionolus evolans strigatus and Opsanus tau.
Seriola zonata, Tautogolabrus adspersus, Tauloga onitis, Paralichthys dentatus, Achirus fasciatus and Echeneis naucrates were also taken at the same place.
Albacora thynnus (Linnaeus).
A small example was secured at Sea Isle City on August 8 by Mr. W. J.
Fox.
Trichiurus lepturus Linnaeus.
Two early records for this species are one from "New Jersey" by Dr. Morris Beasley 9 and another from Egg Harbor by Dr. S. Ashurst.

Urophycis regius (Walbaum).
Mr. Fox secured 2 examples at Sea Isle City on April 24.
On November 2, 1909, Mr. B. W. Griffiths and the writer secured some interesting fishes in the Maurice River basin near Elmer, such as Notropis chalybceus, Schilbeodes gyrinus, Esox reticulatus, Mesogonistius chcetodon, Umbra pygmcea, Erimyzon sucelta oblongus and a number of prawns.
On September 25, 1910, I visited Lake Hopatcong and secured the following in Hurd Cove, near the upper end of the lake: Abramis crysoleucas, Catostomus commersonnii, Erimyzon sucelta oblongus, Ameiurus nebulosus, Schilbeodes gyrinus, Esox americanus, Umbra pygmcea, Pomoxis sparoides, Acantharchus pomotis, Enneacanthus gloriosus, Lepomis auritus, Eupomotis gibbosus, Micropterus dolomieu, and Stizostedion vitreum.
As some of these are distinctly lowland fishes, it is interesting to note them at such a high altitude.

According to Dr. Waite, C. neglecta Ogilby is thought to be identical with Hydrolagus colliei (Lay and Bennett), and had best be regarded as such, unless found to the contrary, though so far as I am aware this is its only occurrence in the Australian seas.
If different, it requires a new specific name.

This example, which I have only recently located in the collection, has been noted by Ryder, with whose remarks I agree.
The original number is, however, painted on the side in black paint and not in white.
The old Bonaparte Catalogue is still extant, but the number on this specimen does not refer to a sturgeon.
I figure this interesting example on account of its historical interest and rarity, as I have found no authentic American figures except Ryder's photographs.

The living members of this family have long been allowed to fall into a single genus, comprising only four American species.
The material studied in the collection of the Academy shows at least twelve species, most of which were pointed out by Cope in 1865.
I feel obliged to admit two genera, as in the Lepisosteus group no enlarged palatine teeth have been distinguished in any examples I have examined, while in the others, or Cylindrosteus group, they occur in the young as well as in the adult.

The above is the only example I have seen, and seems to be most closely related to Lepidosteus grayi Agassiz, which is said to have smooth scales, snout not longer than rest of head, and a series of enlarged teeth in upper jaw.
Agassiz's acount, however, is too incomplete for positive identification.
Regan has examined Agassiz's type and says it has a much broader snout than C. platostomus, or its width at mouth angles 2% in upper jaw length.
C. megalops shows rictus width 2f in snout length.
Regan also thinks C. zadockii Dumenl may be identical with C. grayi Agassiz, though DumeVil gives eye 1-2^in interorbital, and about 2 in postorbital to preopercle edge, besides smaller scales as 61 or 62.
The type of C. grayi is 600 mm.
and the examples of C. zadockii 620-660 mm.

Fort} r persons present.
The death of Arthur Erwin Brown, Sc.D., a Vice-President of the Academy, on the 29th ult., having been announced, the following minute, offered by the Council, was adopted and ordered to be placed on record : The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has heard with deep regret of the death of its senior Vice-President, Arthur Erwin Brown, Sc.D., and desires to put on record its appreciation of the loss it has sustained.
Since his election to membership in 1876 Dr. Brown manifested his interest in the society loyally and efficiently, serving as Curator for seventeen years and as Vice-President since 1900.
Wise in council, efficient and conscientious in the discharge of his official duties, his co-operation was highly esteemed by his associates, while his enlightened sympathy with the progress of the societ}^ materially advanced its interests.
His contributions to science were characterized by accuracy and breadth of view and added notably to the importance of the Academy's publications.
Courtesy, candor and consideration marked his intercourse with his fellow-members, who will long hold his memory in affectionate regard.
Their sorrow enables them to sympathize deeply with his sister, to whom they extend their heartfelt commiseration.
Miss H. Newell Wardle made a communication on the Congress of Americanists held in Mexico, September 7 to 14, and on certain Mexican ruins examined incidental to the meeting.

The following were ordered to be printed: PRELIMINARY STUDIES OF NORTH CAROLINA ORTHOPTERA.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN and MORGAN HEBARD.
During a considerable portion of the time between April, 1904, and June, 1906, the junior author of this paper resided at Sulphur Springs, altitude 2,500 feet, a few miles from Asheville, North Carolina, and collecting in this order was done on many occasions.
The resulting collections, of particular value as showing the character of the Orthopterous fauna of the intermontane valleys of the southern Appalachians, were further supplemented by collections made at Balsam and on the slopes and summit of Mt.
Pisgah in the Pisgah Range and on the upper slopes and summit of Jone's Knob, Balsam Range, North Carolina, With these typical localities of the western portion of the State it seemed quite desirable to compare a representee series from some coastal plain locality, and in consequence the junior author secured from Mr. H. S. Brimley an extensive series of material taken chiefly at Raleigh.
To still further supplement this the senior author was detailed by the Academy to examine portions of eastern North Carolina, collections being made at Edenton, New Berne and Winter Park near Wilmington in August, 1908.
The result of the study of these combined collections are given in the following pages.
1 The total number of specimens examined w r as seventeen hundred and twenty-three, belonging to one hundred and two species, of which seventeen are here recorded from North Carolina for the first time.
The following notes on the localities may be of interest : Sulphur Springs, Buncombe County, North Carolina.
Altitude, 2,500 feet.
This locality was found to offer several distinct types of country, in all of which collecting was done, and on a sufficient number of dates to give an almost complete list of the species found in the vicinity.
The rolling slopes of the surrounding country where not cleared are covered with a heavy forest of oak, chestnut, maple and other deciduous trees, and in the not heav} 7 undergrowth of these tracts the most interesting species found were Melanoplus carncgiei 1 See also these Proceedings, 1910, pp.
407-453, for a systematic study of the specimens of the genus Ischnoptera included in this series.
40 and Melanoplus devius.
In the decaying chestnut logs of this woodland Cryptocercus punctulatus was also taken, and it is from these wooded areas that the great number of Ischnoptera come in the spring to nearby lights.
In the open valleys and on the hillsides covered with short grass and low herbage Eritettix simplex was taken, while the edge of streams and marshy spots revealed many Tettigids.
One small marsh full of cat-tails was found to harbor a large colony of Truxalis brevicornis.
The poorer clay slopes and hillocks are often overgrown with stunted pines having an undergrowth chiefly of broomstraw, grasses and raspberry vines, and here OrchMimum agile, Orchelimum minor (in the trees) and several species of Conocephalus, including C. nemoralis, were taken.
Collecting at night was found productive, and the following species were taken attracted to light: Ischnoptera pensylvanica , I. couloniana, I. uhleriana, I. boredlis, I. bolliana.
Microcentrum rhombifolium and Microcentrum red nerve.
Mt.
Pisgah (altitude, 5,740 feet) and Pisgeih Ridge, junction of Huncombe and three other counties, North Carolina.
On the upper slopes, covered with a heavy but low forest, chiefly composed of chestnut and other deciduous trees, Orthoptera were uncommon.
The interesting captures were Melanoplus devius, Gryllus neglcctus, Nomotettix cristatus, ChloeaUis eojispersa and Melanoplus luridus.
The summit bald proved to be inhabited by Chorthippus curtipennis, Chortophaga viridijasciata, Melanoplus ampleetcns, Amblycorypha rotundijolia and Arphia sulphured.
Jones's Knob (altitude, 6,200 feet), Balsam Mountains, Jackson County, North Carolina.
No Orthoptera whatever were found on the "balsam" (Abies fraseri) clothed summit of the mountain, but lower in the undergrowth of the heavy deciduous forest, especially in more open level grassy glades, the following interesting captures were made: Melanoplus amplectens, Melanoplus divergens, Melanoplus luridus, and Atlanticus pachymerus.
Edenton, Chowan County, North Carolina.
August 20, 1908.
At this locality collecting was done in a field of tall weeds and grasses and in wet drains along roadsides.
The most important captures were Orchelimum molossum and pulchellum.
New Berne, Craven County, North Carolina.
August 24, 1908.
Three conditions were examined at this locality : first, bush and grass growth in a wet drain, where Leptysma marginicollis , Orchelimum.
molossum, Conocephalus strictus and Phylloscyrtus pulchettm were probably the most noteworthy species taken; second, a wet, meadowy area with low lycopodium-like growth in many places and with interspersed dry spots tangled with smilax, the most striking captures being Melanoplus decorus, Clinocephalus elegans, Amblytropidia occidentalis, Paxilla obesa, Neotettix femoratus and Tettigidea prorsa; third, tall dry brush in tall rather open pine woods where Mermiria ulacris and Schistocerca alutacea and americana were secured.
Winter Park, N'ew Hanover County, North Carolina.
August 26, 1908.
At this point which is between Wilmington and Wrightsville, collecting was done in a piece of moderate-sized, long-leafed pine woods, the drier portions of which were carpeted with wire-grass and the moister hollows grown up with waist-high grass.
The drier sections were frequented by Arphia xanthoptera, Scirtetica picta, Hippiscus rugosus, Psinidia fenestralis, Syrbula admirabilis, Orphulella pelidna r Melanoplus keeleri and Amblycorypha uhleri.
The wet grassy areas were inhabited by Clinocephalus elegans, Melanoplus decorus, Paroxya atlantica, Orchelimum glaberrimum and Odontoxiphidium apterum.
The most striking species found in both habitats was Mermiria alacris.
The number of species taken at each of the principal localities was as follows: Eden ton, ten; New Berne, twenty-eight; Winter Park, nineteen; Raleigh, fifty-seven; Sulphur Springs, fifty-one; Balsam, four; Jones's Knob, five; Mt.
Pisgah, several elevations, fifteen.
A few records from Bayville and Cape Henry, Princess Anne County, Virginia, based on material taken by the senior author in 1908, are included to make the report on that year's collecting complete.
Many species have been recorded from Raleigh by Brimley in a recent paper of his on the Orthoptera of that region, 2 and full credit for the pioneer work in faunistic Orthopterology in North Carolina must be given to his paper and to the very important study of a number of localities in the State made by Morse, 3 both of which are referred to in the following pages.

Isclmoptera deropeltiformis (Brunner).
At Sulphur Springs two adult males of this species were taken 01* May 8 and 10, 1904, an immature male on April 13th of the same year and an immature female captured September 23, 1905.
The Raleigh series contains a very interesting lot of ten adult females taken or bred on dates ranging from May 25 to June 25, 1904, and June 7 to> July 1, 1905.
An immature female taken June 21, 1904, was collected 2 Ent.

The series of females shows quite a little individual variation in general size, the extremes of the series of that sex measuring as follows : Length of body 13.5*mm., 17. mm.
Length of pronotum 4 4.5 " Greatest width of pronotum 5 " 6.8 " Length of tegmen 4 " 4.8 " Greatest width of abdomen 6.9 " 8.2 " In coloration two points of variation are apparent: first, the tegmina of the females are decidedly blackish in some specimens, dull brownish in others; second, the femora vary in the presence or absence, or depth when present, of the blackish coloration, the majority of the specimens having the femora ferrugineous like the tibiae.

A single adult female taken at Sulphur Springs.
June 3, 1904, and two adult males secured at Raleigh, May 24, 1905, and June 8.

The single Sulphur Springs specimens was taken in low herbage near the edge of the Avoods.
Isohnoptera pensylvanica (De Geer).
Two males of this species taken at Sulphur Springs, May 25 and 30, 1904, and one of the same sex from Raleigh, June 2, 1904, are in the collection.
In one of the Sulphur Springs specimens the blackish area of the disk of the pronotum is very solid and extensive, crowding the yellowish lateral borders to very narrow eduings.
The other Sulphur Springs individual and the Raleigh specimen have the more normal type of pronotal coloration.
The specimens taken at Sulphur Springs were captured at night attracted to light.
Isohnoptera divisa Saussure and Zehntner.
4 The present collection includes five males and two females taken or bred at Raleigh, June 9-15, 1904. and May 22.
June 9 and July 6-8, 1905.
Data on the specimens inform us that both females were taken by sugaring, one of the males flew into a house at night and three of the same sex were bred.

Isohnoptera couloniana Saussure.s A series of eighteen male and twenty female adult individuals from North Carolina have been examined.
The Raleigh series contains sixteen males and twenty females, taken from under bark of dead pines or bred on dates ranging from June 2 to July 1, 1904, while twoadult males and an immature female were taken at Sulphur Springs, June 5, 1904, at night attracted to light.
The series before us presents a perceptible amount of variation in size and color, the size extremes of both sexes being as follows (all the measured specimens being from Raleigh) : Length of body... 20.5 mm., 21.5 mm., 18.5 mm., 22.5 mm.

The depth of this infuscation is very variable and it is found clearly denned in but five of the males examined, although suggested by points and lines in several others.
In the female much the same thing occurs as in the male, but less clearly defined in most of the cases.
Ischnoptera uhleriana (Saussure).
The series of this species before us is quite extensive, consisting of ninety-nine males and six females, ninety-two males having been taken at Sulphur Springs on dates between May 8 and June 13, 1904, and in April, 1906, the remainder of the series being from Raleigh, taken June 1 to July 1, 1904.
The memoranda with the latter specimens show they were taken from under the bark of dead trees, attracted to light in houses or bred.
The Sulphur Springs specimens were all taken attracted to light.
The coloration of the present series varies but little and then only in the intensification or lightening of the general color.
In but one male is there a darker discal area on the pronotum, and in that case the intensification is not strongly marked and the form of the supraB C. f. these Proceedings, 1910. p. 433.

Isohnoptera borealis Hrunner.
While usually mistaken at first sight for uhleriana, this species is readily separable by its usually smaller size and distinctly transverse and apically rotundato-areuate supra-anal plate of the male.
A series of forty males of this species from Sulphur Springs were taken on dates ranging from May 6 to June 12, 1904, and a single female was collected at Lillington, Harnett County, on June 28, 1904, by Brimley.
The last-mentioned specimen was taken from under a log in a wet place in woods.

From early May to the middle of June this species and Ischnoptera uhleriana could be found almost every night about the lights.
Ischnoptera bolliana Saussure and Zehntner.
The series before us consists of four males and two females taken at Raleigh.
May 30-31, and June 1-8, bred or attracted to light in houses, and five males taken at Sulphur Springs between May S and June 9, 1904.
The coloration of the males is quite uniform, the disk of the pronotum being dark with a medio-longitudinal paler bar dividing it in two sections in all the specimens.

The lights referred to here and elsewhere in this paper at Sulphur Springs were the electric lights along the verandas of the Asheville School, which is situated on the edge of the heavy deciduous forest.
The roaches attracted to these lights would usually fly about wildly for a time and then rest quietly on the nearby walls and ceilings unless disturbed.
Ceratinoptera lutea Saussure and Zehntner.
A single female from Raleigh, taken June 23, 1904, from under rubbish, is in the collection.
It fully agrees with a Florida individual of the same sex.
Cryptocerous punctulatus Scudder.
A most interesting series of this singular roach is now before us, demonstrating the vertical range of the species in North Carolina to be at least three thousand feet, specimens in the collection being from Sulphur Springs, twenty-five hundred feet, and Old Bald Mountain, fifty-five hundred feet elevation.
The localities represented are: Sulphur Springs, May 25, June 3-13, 1904, seventy-nine individuals of both sexes, adult and immature; Old Bald Mountain, 5,500 feet elevation, May 14, 1904, three adults and one immature individual.
An adult individual in the collection of the Academy taken at Blowing Rock, Watauga County, by Joseph Willcox has also been examined.
These insects are found in the partially decayed chestnut logs in the forest.
They were never found except in parts of the logs where the decayed wood was soft, punky and wet.
In such places a colony of a number of specimens would be found in galleries just under the bark and in the log itself, often several specimens in close proximity.
The localities from which the species is now known are New York; Pennsylvania: Virginia; Kentucky; Cumberland Gap, Kentucky; Tennessee ; North Carolina ; Sulphur Springs, Old Bald Mountain and Blowing Rock.

Stagmomantis Carolina (Johannson).
An immature female of this species was taken August 19, 1908, at Bayville, Ya., by Rehn.
Two adult females in the Hebard Collection are from Montgomery County, Virginia, and South Carolina The latter has the wings roseate.
ACRIDID^.
Paratettix cucullatus (Burmeister).
This species is represented by a series of twenty-one North Carolina specimens from the following localities: Raleigh, April 7, May 19 and 26 and July 8 and 18, 1904, three males and three females; Sulphur Springs, April 24 to June 12, 1904, six males, nine females.
The majority of the specimens show a tendency to approach P. texanus, or rather P. cucullatus texanus as we believe it should be, but they are certainly more closely related to specimens from Pennsylvania than others from Texas.
The data with the Raleigh and Sulphur Springs specimens is to the effect that they were secured on damp, low ground near water.
Aorydium hancocki (Morse).
Three female specimens taken at Sulphur Springs, April, 1906, May 7 and September 28, 1904, belong to this species.
An individual of the same sex from White Top, Va., elevation, 5,678 feet, in the Academy collection is inseparable.
All four specimens are of the longwinged type, and in all but one Sulphur Springs individual is the pronotum variegated with velvety-black in addition to the paired post-humeral trigonal patches on the same, which are present in all the specimens.
The previous North Carolina records are those of Morse, viz., Asheville, Linville, Pineola, Roan Mountain 5,500 feet, and Roan Valley, while the White Top record is the first one from the State of Virginia.
Aorydium ornatum (Say).
A single short-winged female of this species was taken at Sulphur Springs, May 9, 1904.
Morse has recorded it from a number of localities in the State.
Acrydium obscurum (Hancock).
The collection contains an extensive series of this species: eight males and ten females from Raleigh taken April 7 to May 19, 1904, and sixteen males and nineteen females taken at Sulphur Springs, May 1 to 15, 1904.
All the specimens in this series are long-winged and numerous shades of ochraceous, rusty-red and deep brown are to be found in it, while a considerable number of individuals possess the paired velvety-black post-humeral trigonal markings.
Morse has recorded this species from Asheville, Pineola, Roan Mountain and Tunis, N. C. Neotettix femoratus (Scudder).
The statement made by Hancock 8 on Scudder's authority regarding the whereabouts of the type of this species is incorrect.
The type is 8 Tettigidce of N.
Amer., p. 96. not lost, and to-day in good condition it forms part of the collection of the American Entomological Society, from which it was described.
From the evidence of this important specimen it appears likely that Neotettix bolivari and rotundifrons Hancock are synonymous with Scudder's species, a possibility pointed out some time ago by Morse.
9 The present collection contains an interesting series of fifty-six specimens distributed as follows: Winter Park, August 26, 19(18, five males, three females, one immature specimen; New Berne, August 24, 1908, four males, one female; Raleigh, June 3-September 7, 1904, six males, seven females; Sulphur Springs, May 6-June 5, 1904. seven males, twenty females, two immature individuals.
The series is dimorphic as to the length of the pronotum and wings, the longwinged type being represented by nine specimens, seven of these being in the Sulphur Springs series.
The size variation is considerable, the New Berne specimens rather curiously being without exception as small or smaller than the smallest individuals from the other localities.
Color presents numerous variations, some are blackish, others dull reddish, some dusty gray-brown, others shades of ochraceous, while the shoulder markings are present in more than half of the series, occasionally with a well-developed humeral " saddle."
The type from Maryland is short-winged and matches in size adult females from Raleigh, the color, however, is more yellowish-ochraceous than in any of the North Carolina specimens.
Morse has recorded this species from fourteen localities in North Carolina extending from Tarboro to Murphy and to an elevation of 5,500 feet on Roan Mountain.
Nomotettix cristatus (Seudder).
A single immature female of this species from 4,500 feet elevation on Mt.
Pisgah, taken October 1, 1904, is the only individual of the species in the collection.
Morse has recorded it from six localities in the State, but this record carries the vertical distribution to a greater height.
This specimen was captured in the undergrowth of the low deciduous forest near its upper limit.
Paxilla obesa (Seudder).
This robust species has long been a will-o'-the-wisp in our work in the southeastern States, and it is with great satisfaction that we are able to record its capture at New Berne, August 24, four males and one female being taken in a wet meadow in company with Clinocephalus elegans and Melanoplus decorus.
This capture considerably exPubl.

The range is now known to extend from Port Orange and De Funiak Springs, Fla., to New Berne, N. C. The female and one of the males measure as follows : Length of body 10.5 mm., 12.8 mm.
Length of pronotum 9.2 " 11 " Length of caudal femur 6.7 " 8 " Tettigidea lateralis (Pay).
A series of eighty-two North Carolina individuals are before us, this comprising the following: Winter Park, August 26, 1908, two females; New Berne, August 24, 1908, two females; Raleigh, April, 7-July 18, 1904, twenty-one males, sixteen females; Sulphur Springs, April 2-September 24.
1904, eight males, thirty females; Mt.
Pisgah, 4,500 feet elevation, October 1, 1904, one adult male, one immature male, one immature female.
In this series the front margin of the pronotum is found to vary from broadly arcuate to distinctly angulate, regardless of locality or environment.
The Raleigh series is overwhelmingly long-winged, but one in the whole thirty-seven individuals being short-winged, while in the thirty-eight Sulphur Springs specimens but two males and twelve females are short-winged.
Both Winter Park representatives are long-winged, as well as the single adult from Mt.
Pisgah and the two specimens from New Berne.
Color variations are numerous and varied, and size variation is quite marked in the larger series.
Tettigidea prorsa Scudder.
An immature male and an adult female taken at New Berne, August 24, 190S, belong to this rare species.
The specimens were taken in a wet meadow in company with Tettigidea lateralis and Paxilla obesa.
Both specimens are short-winged, as is also a male individual from Beach Haven, N. J., taken in the spring of 1907, the only other specimen of the species seen.
The range of the species is now known to extend from Georgia to east-central New Jersey, the only records in addition to those mentioned above being from Georgia, North Carolina and Denmark, S. C. Truxalis brevicornis (Johannson).
Three pairs from Raleigh, taken August 15 to September 15 in or on the edge of marsh, and an extensive series of twenty-four males and five females taken September IS at Sulphur Springs represent this widely distributed species.
The Sulphur Springs series was captured among cat-tails.
All of the males are in the green and brown phase, four of the eight females in a uniform green phase and the remaining four in a uniform brownish phase.
Mermiria alacris Scudder.
This beautiful species was found to be fairly numerous but very wary in oak scrub along the edge of pine woods at New Berne on August 21, and equally numerous but easier to secure in long-leaf pine woods at Winter Park on August 26.
Two males and one female were secured at the former locality and five males and four females at the latter.
In size there is considerable variation, which appears from the material in hand, comprising Florida material as well the North Carolina series, to be purely individual in character, more marked in the male than in the female sex.
The coloration is quite constant, varying only in the extent of facial suffusion and the strength of the medio-longitudinal streak on the head and pronotum.
The only previous North Carolina record for the species is a doubtful one based on a young individual from Salisbury.
Syrbula admirabilis (Uhler).
The localities from which this species is represented in the collections are: Bayville, Va., August 19, one immature female; Edenton, August 20, one male, two females; Winter Park, August 26, two females; Raleigh, August 17-September 2, three males, four females; Sulphur Springs, September 24-October 6, one male, two females.
A variety of habitats are represented as the labels indicate a range of environment extending from dry pinewoods undergrowth at Raleigh and Winter Park to wet woods at Bayville and wet drains at Edenton.
In size the North Carolina specimens are nearer to individuals from New Jersey than they aie to the extremely large Florida representatives.
Eritettix simplex (Scudder).
A most interesting series of one hundred and forty-eight specimens of this species taken at Sulphur Springs is in the collection.
Of this representation seventy-eight are adult males, sixty-five adult females and five immature individuals, the dates extending from April 2 to June 12, the immatu.e individuals having been taken on April 2 and 13.
A pair from Raleigh, taken April 13 and May 5 in broom straw field, have also been examined.
The species was found locally plentiful in the low grasses of the treeless slopes and valleys.
The individuals with general color pale yellowish ochraceous were found almost invariably in the very bottom of the valleys, and seemed a color adaptation in their resemblance to the more plentiful whitish pebbles strewn about there.
Several questions have been brought into prominence by the examination of this material, the first being in regard to the name.
Fortunately the type of Gomphoeerus simplex Scudder 10 is still in existence in good condition in the Academy collections, and several efforts to find some valid reason for recognizing the later and very poorly characterized G. carinaius Scudder from the ''Middle States" having failed, we are under the necessity of uniting the two, simplex having six years' priority.
At the present time we are not prepared to give any expression on the exact relationship of this species and the western allies with clavate antenna 1 , viz., E. virgatus, tricarinatus and naviculus.
The other point is relative to the presence of marked dimorphism and dichromatism in this species.
The greater majority of the specimens of this species before us possess distinct supplementary carina?
on the dorsum of the head and pronotum, the type of the species belonging to this form, while nine males and seven females, representing both localities, have the supplementary carinse lacking on the pronotum and weak or lacking on the head.
A series of eight males and one female from Sulphur Springs are intermediate between the two extremes, having the supplementary carinse very faintly and incompletely indicated on the pronotum and faintly or moderately indicated on the head.
There is a great amount of individual variation in the form of the lateral carinas of the pronotum, some specimens having them subparallel, distinctly not constricted mesad and rarely very slightly convergent cephalad, while the great majority have the carinse constricted more or less distinctly and sharply immediately cephalad of the middle.
There is no correspondence between these two conditions and the presence or absence of supplementary carinse.
The distance between the lateral carinas of the pronotum is variable.
In general size the species varies considerably, particularly in the male sex.
The dichromatism noticed is typically examplified by one form with the general color pale yellowish ochraceous and the postocular bars broad and solid, extending to the tegmina, and vandyke brown in color, while the other type, which is by far the more numerous, has 10 Trans.

Soc, II, p. 305, 1869.
(Delaware.)
no solid postocular bars and the dorsal surface of the head and pronotum is marked with a pair of longitudinal velvety blackish or brownish lines.
Between the two types are numerous individuals which seem to bridge more or less completely the gap between the extremes.
In some the dorsum is uniformly dark with distinct broad, postocular bars, in others the dorsum is almost uniform dark while the postocular bars are lacking.
The coloration of this species offers a curious parallelism to that of Psolcessa texana Scudder which we have recently treated in detail.
11 the pale type with the decided postocular bars beino; analogous to Psoloessa buddiana, the strongly dorsal bilineate type to P. ferruginea and the dull form to true P. texana.
The range of this species extends from Connecticut (New Haven) to northeastern Alabama (Valley Head and Lookout Mountain), east to Raleigh, N. C. Its zonal correlation would appear to be Carolinian.
Amblytropidia oocidentalis (Saussure).
Two adult males and one adult female from Raleigh, taken April 13, 22 and May 19 in broomstraw fields and a series of seventeen immature individuals in three stages of development taken at New Berne, August 24, have been examined.
The only North Carolina records are from Raleigh, Selma and New Berne, these constituting the most northern reliable records for the species.
Orphulella pelidna tBurmeister).« A single female of this species was taken at Cape Henry, Va., August 19, on dry beach grass, while at Bayville, Va., August 19, a single specimen of the same sex was secured at a wet spot in woods.
At New Berne, August 24, six males and one female were secured in a wet meadow, while two males and one female were captured in dry pine woods at Winter Park, August 26.
A series of twelve males and eleven females taken at Raleigh, July 18 to September 20, were secured in pine woods, in pasture, in stubble field and at the edge of marsh land.

12 After numerous attempts to differentiate Scudder's Orphulella pratorum, we are compelled to use the oldest available name and allow Scudder's name to remain in abeyance, to be properly associated or relegated to the synonymy at some future date.
However, it might be well to state that in using the antennal character given by Scudder (Canad.
En torn., XXXI, p. 179) to separate 0. pratorum and pelidna, nearly every specimen from the eastern United States which we have examined, and we have seen nearly a thousand individuals from that region, would fall into pratorum.
We have never seen any specimens of Orphulella from Pennsylvania, the type locality of pelidna, except individuals of 0. speciosa, while New Jersey specimens by Scudder's key would fall into O. pratorum.
It seems quite likely to us that the antennal length is an unsatisfactory character.
Dichromorpha viridis (Scudder).
A single male of this species was taken in a wet spot in woods at Bayville, Va., August 19, and two males from Raleigh, taken July 18 and 20, on low ground are in the collection.
Morse has recorded the species from Norfolk, Ya., and Greensboro, Salisbury and Raleigh, N, C. Clinocephalus elegans Morse.
In a wet meadow at New Berne, on August 24, and in wet spots with tall grass in pine woods at Winter Park, August 26, this species was found quite numerous, a series of four males, ten females and two immature individuals being taken at the former locality and five males and nine females at the latter.
When compared with typical New Jersey specimens of C. elegans and Florida specimens of typical and nearly typical C. e. pulcher the North Carolina individuals are seen to be nearly intermediate, although a shade nearer true elegans.
The peculiar coloration found in some individuals of C. e. pulcher is intimated in several specimens from Winter Park, but these lack the extreme development in this line occasionally found in the more southern form.
The size is decidedly larger than the average of typical elegans, but in the male sex pulcher is distinctly larger than the North Carolina specimens of that sex.
The measurements of a pan from Winter Park are as follows: Length of body 18 mm., 23.5 mm.
Length of pronotum 4 " 4.6 " Length of tegmen 9.2 " 12 Length of caudal femur 10.8 " 13.8 " Chloealtis conspersa Harris.
A pair of this boreal species was taken by the junior author, a male from an elevation of 4,500 feet on Mt.
Pisgah, October 1, 1904. and a female from the summit of Jones's Knob, Balsam Mountains, 6,200 feet elevation, October 7, 1905.
Morse has recorded this species from Jones's Peak (Jones's Knob) and Steestachee Bald in the Balsam Mountains, at elevations of from 5,500 to 6,000 feet.
These constitute the only records for the species in North Carolina.
Both specimens here recorded were taken amid the undergrowth of deciduous forests.
Chorthippus ourtipennis (Harris).
Three males and four females of this species were secured at the summit of Mt.
Pisgah, elevation 5,740 feet, on October 1, 1904, where it was the most plentiful species of the summit bald.
Morse has recorded the species from Balsam, 4,500-5,700 feet, Cranberry, Linville, Grandfather Mountain, 4,500-5,000 feet, Roan Mountain and Roan Valley.
From these records, all at present known from the State of North Carolina, it would seem that the species ranges in that State from about 3,200 feet (Cranberry) probably to the highest points in the State where suitable environment occurs.
Arphia xanthoptera (Burmeister).
The Sulphur Springs collection contains two males and five females of this species taken September 9 to 29, while two males from Raleigh taken Sei^tember 2, a pair from New Berne taken August 24 and two females secured August 26, at Winter Park are in the collections.
At Winter Park it frequented spots in the pine woods and the labels of the Raleigh material show it was secured at that place in pine woods and in field of broomstraw.
High open scrub near pine woods was the habitat frequented at New Berne.
The species has been recorded from a number of North Carolinan localities, but the Winter Park and New Berne records are the first from the coast region.
Arphia sulphurea (Fabricius).
At Sulphur Springs this species was taken on dates extending from April 2 to June 13, a series of eighteen males and ten females being secured.
Raleigh is represented by ten males and three females taken April 27 to May 19.
On May 14, two males were taken at 5,700 feet elevation on the summit bald of Mt.
Pisgah, this being the highest point from which the species has been recorded in North Carolina.
Chortophaga viridifasciata (De Geer).
This widely distributed species is represented by a series of ten males and fifteen females from Sulphur Springs, taken on dates ranging from April 13 to September 29.
Two males and one female were also taken on Mt.
Pisgah at an elevation of 4,500 feet on October 1.
Three of the females in the Sulphur Springs series are extremely large for the species, one of the three, which are quite uniform, measuring as follows: length of body 31 mm.
; length of pronotum 8: length of tegmen 27.2; length of caudal femur 16.5.
The remainder of the series is nearer what might be called the usual size of the species.
But one male in the Sulphur Springs series is in the green phase, although seven of the fifteen females are in the same condition.
The Mt.
Pis ah female is in the green phase.
Hippisous phoenicopterus (Burmeister).
A series of ten males and four females from Sulphur Springs, taken May S to June 13, 1904, and two males and one female from Raleigh, secured May 19 to July 21, 1904, in old fields represent this species.
Two males from Sulphur Springs and the female from Raleigh have the head, pronotum and caudal femora greenish, a condition seen in specimens from other localities and which is analogous to that noticed in some individuals of the genus Gomphocerns.
This species is one of the forms which appears in the spring in company with Eritettix simplex, Chortophaga viridifasciata, Arphia sulphured and Hippiscus apiculoius in the open grassy areas.
Hippiscus rugosus (Scudder).
Sulphur Springs is represented in the series of this species by six males and five females, taken September 2 to 29, while five males and two females secured at Raleigh August 4 to September 2 in pasture and broomstraw field are in the collection.
Three males and four females were taken at Winter Park, August 26 on sandy spots in pine woods, where the species was numerous.
The specimens from Winter Park are particularly interesting in that while the males are no larger than individuals of that sex from Sulphur Springs the females are considerably larger, in this respect exceeding any seen by the authors.
This species is now known to range on the Atlantic slope from southern Maine (Norway) to northern Florida (Lake City).
Hippiscus apioulatus (Harris)."
Twelve males and thirteen females, taken at Sulphur Springs April 13 to June 13, 1904, constitute the first record for the species from North Carolina and the first in the east with definite data from south of the District of Columbia, The subdecussate pale pronotal markings are mure or less marked in twelve specimens.
13 It is unfortunately necessary to substitute this name for ''Hippiscus tuberculatus" of authors, which is quoted from Acridium tuberculatum Palisot de Beauvoi-s (Ins.
Rec.
d'Af.
et Amer., p. 145, pi.
4, fig.
1) whose figure clearly pictures this species, but who placed as a reference to the species Gryttus tuberculatus Fabricius, an Old World species belonging to another genus, with which he considered his material from the United States identical.
In consequence his name is not available and the next must be taken.
Harris's Locusta apicutata (In Hitchcock, Rep. Geol.
Mass., 2d cd., p. 576, 1835) is merely a renaming of Beauvois's species appearing in this form: "Locusta L. apiculata.
fuberculata P. de Beauv.
F?"
Although unaccompanied by a diagnosis, this name is clearly intended to replace the misidentified tuberculatum of Beauvois, and as such we are under the the necessity of using; it.
Dissosteira Carolina (Linnaeus), A single female taken at New Berne, August 24, and one of the same sex from 4,500 feet elevation on Mt.
Pisgah, taken October 1, 1904, have been examined.
Spharagemon bolli Scudder.
This species is represented by two males and four females from Sulphur Springs, taken September 18-24, and three males and one female from Raleigh taken August 19-September 9 in pinewoods.
The Raleigh female is somewhat larger than the average of the species.
Scirtetioa picta (Scudder).
This species was found on bare sandy spots in pinewoods at Winter J 'ark, August 26, two males and four females being taken.
These specimens show an approach to S. marmorata, but this does not appear to be as decided as in the case of Eure, North Carolina specimens examined by Morse.
14 The two localities here given are the only ones in North Carolina from which the species has been recorded, though doubtless it occurs in all suitable locations in the eastern part of the State.
Psinidia fenestralis (Serville).
On the dunes at Cape Henry, Ya., August 18, three males of this ammophilous species were taken, while a pair was secured on bare sandy spots in pine woods at Winter Park, August 26.
The only previous North Carolina records were from Eure and Tarboro.
Trimerotropis maritima (Han is).
One male and six females taken at Cape Henry, Ya., August 18, are of particular interest, as they furnish additional evidence on Morse's observations 15 regarding the presence at this locality of examples apparently intermediate between T. maritima and T. citrina in addition to typical examples of each.
Two of the females distinctly tend toward T. citrina in the color of the caudal tibiae, although the general coloration and minor structural features are essentially the same as in maritima.
No typical citrina were taken by us at Cape Henry, where maritima occurred on the bare strand and on the Ammophila covered dunes.

41 eastern and southeastern States from nearly fifty different localities.
In the collection before us is a series of eight males and three females from Raleigh, taken July 8 to September 13, and two males and four females from Sulphur Springs, secured September 27 and 29 ; 1905.
The records of this species in the eastern States extend from Maryland to northern Florida (Pablo Beach, Jacksonville, Carrabelle, Apalachicola, Ft. Barrancas and Warrington) and the coast of Mississippi (Gulfport), vertically distributed from sea-level to at least 2,500 feet (Sulphur Springs), wherever suitable environment occurs, the species being distinctly xerophilous.
The Raleigh individuals were taken on sandy or dusty roads or at electric lights.
This is a midsummer species, only occasional tattered individuals being found as late as the middle of September.
Leptysma marginicollis (ServiUe).
This paludicolous species is represented by a series of ten males and five females taken at Raleigh, on May 13 and September 9, 1904, and a single immature male taken at New Berne, August 24, 190N.
The Raleigh specimens are fairly uniform in size.
Sohistoceroa alutacea (Harris).
At New Berne a single male of this species was taken in scrub near pine woods on August 24, while three males and three females were secured at Winter Park in dry spots in long-leaf pine woods, August 26.
The New Berne specimen is of the yellowish fasciate type, while the Winter Park individuals are of the dull russet and vandyke brown type, very similar in coloration and size to specimens from the pine barren region of New Jersey.
The Winter Park representatives all lack the medio-longitudinal stripe.
Sohistoceroa americana (Drury).
This species is represented by five males, two taken at Sulphur Springs, May 15 and June 5, 1904, two secured at the summit of Mt.
Pisgah, 5,700 feet elevation, October 4, 1904, and the fifth captured at New Berne, August 24, 1908.
Sohistoceroa damnifica (Saussure).
A series of eleven males and six females taken at Sulphur Springs on dates ranging from April 2 to May 15 and from September 18 to 29, 1904, and five males, and one female taken at Raleigh, March 9 to April 13, and September 7, 1904, represent this species.
The Sulphur Springs males are rather small when compared with the Raleigh individuals of that sex.
At Sulphur Springs the specimens were all captured in the undergrowth along the edge of the deciduous forest.
Melanoplus atlanis (Riley).
This widely distributed species is represented by thirty-nine North Carolina individuals distributed as follows: Raleigh, July 1-24.
July 22, August 3-15, September 22, twelve d\ eight 9 ; Lillington, June 28, one cT ; Sulphur Springs, May 6, June 13, September 18-28, six d\ three 9 ; Edenton, August 20, two cf, one 9 ; New Berne, August 24, two <u , four 9.
Melanoplus scudderi (Uhler).
This species is represented by a Raleigh series of seven males and ten females, taken August 25 and September 2-22, 1904.
These specimens average about the same size as individuals from New Jersey.
Upland fields, pastures and pine woods were frequented by this species at Raleigh.
Melanoplus oarnegiei Morse.
This interesting form is represented by fourteen males and seventeen females taken at Sulphur Springs, September 17-29 and October 7, 1904 and 1905.
The series is fairly uniform in size and with but little variation in general coloration.
The only previous records for this species are the original ones from Denmark and Spartanburg, S. C, and Blue Ridge, Ga.
In the vicinity of Sulphur Springs this was the most abundant short-winged Melanoplus.
It was found usually in the undergrowth of the woods in the more open situations.
Melanoplus deceptus Morse.
In the Academy collection there is a single imperfect male of this species from "Tennessee."
The only previous records were from Balsam (Jones's Peak), N. C, and Jasper, Ga. Melanoplus devius Morse.
A series of six males and ten females from Sulphur Springs taken September 9 to 29, 1904-1905, and two males, seven females and one immature individual taken on the higher wooded slopes (5,000 feet) of Mt.
Pisgah, October 1, 1904, represent this species, previously known only from Wytheville, Va., and Topton, X. C. Both lotexhibit some individual variation in size, although this is more pronounced in the Sulphur Springs specimens, particularly the males.
However, the original measurements given by Morse cover the extremes in size before us, the Pisgah females averaging very slightly smaller than Sulphur Springs individuals of the same sex.
The Pisgah males are so few in number that comparison of that sex is of little value, but measurements of the females from both localities show that the apparently shorter femora of the Pisgah females is much more than a mere proportional reduction.
The average difference is 1.4 mm., the Sulphur Springs specimens averaging 12.9 (12.5-13.5), the Pisgah series 11.5 (11.2-11.8).
The Mt.
Pisgah specimens are, as a rule, darker and somewhat less contrasted than the Sulphur Springs series.
The length of the furcula is, as stated by Morse, quite variable.
The species was never found in the least plentiful about Sulphur Springs.
Its habitat proved to be constantly sylvan.
Melanoplus decorus Scudder.
This little-known species is represented by six males and one female from Winter Park, taken August 26, 1908, and four males from NewBerne, August 24, 1908.
In size there is quite a little variation as the caudal femora of the males range between 9.5 and 11.2 millimetres in length.
The general coloration varies appreciably from a general gamboge-yellow to fawn color, while the coloration of the face varies from uniform with the body to walnut-brown.
The blackish coloration of the tubercle of the subgenital plate of the male is quite striking.
The previously unique types were taken at Dingo Bluff, N. C. At New Berne the species occurred in a piece of moist meadow land.
and at Winter Park it frequented high grass in wet spots in long-leaf pine woods.
The species was scarce at New Berne, but more numerous at Winter Park.
Melanoplus ampleotens Scudder.
At Balsam this species was found at elevations of from 3,500 to 4,000 feet on October 7, 1905. while the same day it was secured at 5,000 feet elevation on Jones's Knob.
On October 1.
1904, it was taken at 4,500 feet and 5,700 feet (summit) on Mt.
Pisgah.
Balsam is represented by two males and eight females, Jones's Knob by two males and three females and Mt.
Pisgah by two males and six females.
Morse has already called attention to the variability of this species, and our material substantiates his remarks.
The variation in the length of the tegmina is very considerable in some specimens, the extremes of the males measuring 4.2 and 7 mm., of the females 5.5 and 8, all measured being from Mt.
Pisgah except the male with shortest tegmina, which is from Balsam.
All the specimens of this species were found in distinctly sylvan surroundings where grass was present in some quantities, excepting in the case of those taken on the summit bald of Mt.
Pisgah.
Melanoplus divergens Morse.
Three males and three females of this species taken at Balsam, 4,000 feet elevation, on October 7, 1905, are practically topotypes.
Morse's specimens having been secured at 5,000-6,000 feet at the same locality.
The males all exceed the maximum body length given by Morse by at least 4 millimeters, but the other measurements of that sex and of the female are around Morse's maximum.
These specimens were all taken in a grassy glade covered with a scattering growth of deciduous trees.
Melanoplus femur-rubmm (DeGeer).
All the North Carolina material of the femur-rubrum series seen is referable to De Geer's species, although the more austral propinquus has been recorded from the State.
The series before us includes the first records from the coastal section of the States, the localities represented being: New Berne, August 24, 1908, two males; Edenton, August 20, 1908, two males, three females; Raleigh, August 20, September 4-10, four males, six females; Sulphur Springs, September 18-27 and October 6, 1904, eight males and six females.
At Edenton it was found in grassy drains and in high weeds, and at New Berne in meadow land.
Melanoplus keeleri (Thomas).
This interesting species was found generally distributed, but scarce in pine woods at Winter Park, August 26, where three males and three females were taken.
Raleigh is represented in our series by one male and three females taken in pine woods, broomstraw and upland field on August 19 and September 13 and 22, 1904.
These specimens are very slightly smaller than individuals from Pablo Beach, Fla., but equal to or very slightly larger than the measurements given by Scudder in his Revision of the Melanopli.
The only localities for this species from the State in addition to the above are Smithville, Dingo Bluff and "North Carolina."
Melanoplus luridus (Dodge).
A series of twenty-seven specimens represent this species, distributed as follows: Balsam, 3,500-4,000 feet, October 7, 1904, four males, two females; Jones's Knob, Balsam Mountains, October 7, 1905, five males, one female; Mt.
Pisgah, 4,500 feet, October 1, 1904, eight males, seven females.
Morse has recorded the species from a number of localities in the mountains of North Carolina.
This appears to be the most plentiful species of Melanoplus on all the mountains of this region at altitudes above 4,000 feet.
Melanoplus femoratus (Burmeister).
A single male of this species taken at Sulphur Springs, June 2, 1904. is in the collection.
Morse has recorded it from the same localitv.
Paroxya atlantica Scudder.
At New Berne a single female of this species was taken in wet meadow land on August 24. while at Winter Park it was fairly numerous in wet grassy depressions in pine woods, where, on August 26 ?
seven males and two females were secured.
The specimens show a decided approach to the more northern form Scudderi, which is probably but a geographic race, the tegmina and caudal limbs in the North Carolina individuals being somewhat shorter than in Plorida specimens.
This is the first record of the species from North Carolina.
Paroxya floridiana (Thorn This moisture-loving species is represented by one male and two females from Raleigh, taken August 22 and September 9, 1904, two females from Edenton.
taken August 20, and two of the same sex from New Berne, secured August 24.
At Edenton and New Berne it occurred on grasses in wet drains, while the Raleigh specimens are labelled "swamp" and "edge of marsh."

The present records are the first from North Carolina.
Scudderia curvicauda (DeGeer).
A single female of this species from Raleigh, taken August 30, in pine woods, has been examined.
Scudderia furcata Brunner.
Three males and three females from Raleigh, taken in pine woods September 2-7, 1904, one male and three females from Sulphur Springs, September 17-28, 1904-5, and a pair from Bayville, Ya., taken in mixed woods undergrowth, August 19, represent this species.
Previous to this writing Raleigh was the only exact locality in the AtlanticStates between Xew Jersey and southern Georgia from which the species had been recorded.
Scudderia cuneata Morse.
A male of this species from Raleigh represents the most northerlypoint at which the species has been taken.
It was secured September 9, 1904, and is labelled "edge of marsh."
No doubt this is the form recorded by Brimley as S. furcifcra, 16 which latter might readily be mistaken for this species, although its range is entirely southwestern and Mexican.
The previous records of cuneata are Alabama (type locality), Thomasville, Ga,, and Pablo Beach and Miami, Fla.
It is apparently a purely Lower Austral form.
Amblycorypha oblongifolia (DeGeer).
A single male taken at New Berne, August 24, and another individual of the same sex taken at Bayville, Va., August 19, represent this species.
At the former locality the species was taken in high weeds along a wet drain and at the latter it was secured in mixed woods undergrowth.
These records are the first from either State.
Amblycorypha rotundifolia cSeudder).
This interesting species is represented by two specimens taken at high elevations, one, a female, from 6,000 feet on Jones's Knob.
Balsam Mountains, October 7, 1905, the other, a male, from 5,740 feet on Mt.
Pisgah, Pisgah Ridge, October 1, 1904.
These individuals show no points of difference from Indiana specimens.
The specimen from Mt.
Pisgah was beaten from the low bushes growing on the summit bald, while the individual from Jones's Knob was found in the forest undergrowth.
Aside from one record from Georgia, these are the only positive records of the species from the South Atlantic States.
Amblycorypha uhleri St41.
Three males taken at Raleigh, August 20-September 4, 1904, in pine woods and at light, and a single male secured at Winter Park, August 26, 1908, in wire grass in pine woods, represent this austral species.
The Winter Park specimen has a somewhat larger tympanum than the other specimens and the pronotum is also relatively broader caudo-dorsad, but it is not separable from other specimens of the species examined.
The same individual is yellowish in coloration instead of green, the color being extremely protective in the dry wire grass.
The two localities given above are the only ones in the State from which the species has been recorded, Brimley having already recorded it from the first-mentioned.
Microcentrum rhombifolium (Saussure).
A single female from Raleigh, taken August 25, 1904, and an indi" Ent.
News, XIX, p. 19. vidua!
of the same sex from Sulphur Springs, taken September 14, 1004, represent this species.
These records are the first with exact data from the State.
Microcentrum retinerve (Burmeister).
An interesting series of this species, consisting of seventeen males and one female, taken at Sulphur Springs, September 22-October 8, 1004-1005, is in the collection.
This series is uniform in size and in all the males the tympanum is washed with two shades of brown proximad of the stridulating rem, which is also unifoimly of the lighter shade of brown.
These specimens were all captured after dark attracted to light.
No exact record of the occurrence of the species in North Carolina has been previously published.
Neoconooephalus mexicanus (Snussure).
Two females of this species, one from Raleigh, taken May 13, 100-1, the other from Sulphur Springs secured, September 18, 1004, represent this austral species.
These localities are the only ones in the State at which the species has been taken, the previous records being "North Carolina" (Karny) and Brimley's Raleigh information.
The Sulphur Springs individual was attracted to light at night and so captured.
Heooonocephalus palustris (BlatcWey).
A single male from Raleigh, taken in wet meadows, August 4, 1004, is in the collection.
Brimley has recorded it from this locality, which is the only one in the Southern States at which the species has been Becured.
Neoconocephalus retusus atlanticus (Bruner).
The material examined in the present connection corroborates the opinion previously expressed by us 17 regarding the relationship of retusus and atlanticus.
The series before us consists of six males and one female taken at Sulphur Springs, September 18 to October 6, 1004-1005, and four males and two females from Raleigh taken August 31 -September 7, 1004. at light, in garden and in grassy places ii\ pine woods.
A single immature female taken at Bayville, Ya., August 10, 1008, has also been examined.
The Sulphur Springs series shows both color phases and is quite uniform in size, being almost typical atlanticus, as determined by comparison with paratypes.
The Raleigh series is all in the green phase and shows little individual 17 Proc.

This tendency is so great that the specimens are almost intermediate in character and can hardly be referred more to one than to the other.
As this interesting case can well be demonstrated b}^ figures, the following measurements made from average individuals, when taken with those previously given by us, 18 show the extent of geographic size variation in this species: Asheville, N.C. Raleigh, N.C. \\ aycross.Ga.

The record of atlanticus at Thomasville, Ga., made by the authors, 20 is erroneous, due to the non-association of the sexes, the record of atlanticus being based on males and that of retusus from the same locality on the easily recognizable female.
A male of atlanticus from Montgomery County, Virginia, in the Hebard collection, has also been examined by us.
Orchelimum militare Rehn and He bard.
A single male of this species was taken in high grass in moist spots in pine woods at Winter Park on August 26.
The specimen is distinctly smaller than Georgia individuals, but otherwise it is quite typical.
The range of the species is carried a considerable distance northward by the capture of this specimen.

A single male from Raleigh taken August 30, at edge of marsh, is also in the collection.
The specimens from North Carolina all have the head more or less decidedly reddish, and should be regarded as representing 0. erythrocephalum Davis if this is considered a valid species, which the present authors believe is not the case.
Sufficient material is in hand, from about a dozen localities ranging from New Jersey to north-central Florida to demonstrate to our satisfaction the great amount of individual variation in this species in the coloring of the head as well as that of the dorsum of the pronotum.
The emphasis placed on the ■characters separating erythrocephalum from vulgare in the original description of the former, tends to mislead one, as vulgare is quite distinct in cereal and other characters and glaberrimum with which the specimens of erythrocephalum should have been compared is not mentioned.
Regarding the presence or absence of spines on the ventral carinae of the caudal femora, the following notes made from fourteen specimens of this species may be of interest: three specimens have 0-0, one 0-1, two 0-2, one 0-3, four 1-2, one 1-4, one 2-4, one 3-3.
In size the species regularly increases southward, north-central Florida specimens being extremely large when compared with New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland individuals.
Thomasville, (la., representatives are hardly smaller than Jacksonville and other north Florida individuals, while North Carolina specimens are about intermediate in size between those from Georgia and Delaware.
As has already been pointed out by the present authors, the length of the tegmina is quite variable.
Orchelimum agile (DeGeer).
81 A series of eleven males and two females taken at Sulphur Springs, September 17-29, 1904 and 1905, and a single female taken at Raleigh, September 17, 1904, in upland pasture represent this species.
The diversity in size in the Sulphur Springs series is considerable, aside 21 After carefully examining the literature bearing on the identity of the much-discussed Locusta agilis De Geer, we are compelled to retire Harris's vulgare in favor of the much older De Geerian name, which we believe to be undoubtedly based on the same insect.
De Geer's locality was Pennsylvania and Harris's Massachusetts, and a comparison of material from the two States shows no reason for their separation.
De Geer's figure is, to us, sufficient to fix the species.
We are also of the opinion that Orchelimum gracile Harris is a synonym of Conocephalus fasciatus (De Geer).
from the length of the tegmina and wings which vary independently of general size.
The coloration, however, does not vary in as marked a degree, being chiefly limited to the depth of infuscation of the median portion of the pronotal bar.
The Raleigh female and one Sulphur Springs male are ochraceous instead of greenish or greenishyellow in general color.
A single specimen of this species from Montgomery County, Virginia, in the Hebard Collection is the only record of the species from that State.
Brimley has recorded the species from North Carolina at Raleigh.
Orohelimum molossum Rehn and Hebard.
This species, which was previously known only from northern Florida (Pablo Beach and Gainesville) and Georgia (Thomasville and Thompson's Mills), is represented by two males and two females taken in a wet drain at Edenton, August 20, a single female taken in high weeds on moist ground at New Berne, August 2-1, and five males and one female taken at Raleigh, September 4-31, 1904.
In all probability the record of the closely allied 0. nitidum at Raleigh made by Brimley 22 really relates to this species.
A specimen from Roslyn, Va., in the Academy's collection, taken in September by Mr. Caudell, shows this species to range to the vicinity of Washington.
The North Carolina specimens exhibit considerable individual variation in size, but as is the case with 0. glaberrimum, the average indidual from Virginia and North Carolina is smaller than Georgia and Florida examples.
The paired pronotal lines are sometimes absent, and vary considerably in intensity when present.
Orchelimum minor Bruner.
This beautiful species is represented by three males taken in low pines, fifteen to -twenty feet from the ground at Sulphur Springs, September 2 and October 6, 1905, and a single female from Raleigh, taken September 20, 1904.
Material has also been examined in this connection from Thompson Mills, Ga., and Atsion, N. J., the latter taken October 8, 1903, by the junior author.
The five males before us show very little individual variation in size, and as no measurements have ever been published for the species it seems desirable to give the more important ones of the specimens before us.

Orchelimum spinulosum (Redtenbacher).
Three males and one female from Raleigh, taken September 9, 1004 from grassy edge of marsh, belong to this species, described from "North Carolina" and since unreported.
Specimens from Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia and Tinicum, Pa., taken by the authois, show the range of the species to extend considerably to the northward.
Orchelimum pulchellum Davis.
A pair taken at Raleigh, August 22 and 30, 1904. in a cat-tail swamp and at edge of marsh and a single male taken in a wet drain at Edenton, August 20, represent this species.
Originally described from Dennisville, Helmetta and Trenton, N. J., this beautiful species is now known to range from north-central New Jersey (Helmetta) to eastern North Carolina.
The original describer compared the species with nigripes, but its relationship is not with that species, the cerci being decidedly different.
It is, in fact, much nearer to 0. spinulosum and less closely to O. minor, the form of the cerci being of much the same type in the three.
The Raleigh individuals are somewhat larger than the Eclenton specimen.
Conocephalus strictus (Scudder).
Xiphidium strictum of authors.
Three adult females taken at Raleigh, September 9-20, 190-1, and two adult and three immature females secured at New Berne, August 24, 1908. belong to this species.
At the former locality the species occurred in pasture, in broomstraw field and in grass along edge of marsh, while at New Berne it was taken in a piece of open meadow land.
The only previous record of the occurrence of the species in the southeastern States is Brimley's Raleigh note.
Conocephalus ensiferus (Scudder).
Xiphidium ensiferum of authors.
This species is represented by a series of eight males and eight females taken at Sulphur Springs, September 2-29, 1905, and five males and five females secured at Raleigh, August 16 to September 9, 1904.
At Raleigh it was secured at electric lights, at grassy edge of marsh, in grassy places in pine woods and in broomstraw field.
A pair from Raleigh and one female from Sulphur Springs are longwinged.
The individuals before us vary but little in size.
The localities cited above are, with the addition of Fort Reed.

The Fort Reed record was based on immature material and, as intimated at the time, may belong to another species.
Conocephalus fasciatus (DeGeer).

This widely distributed species is represented in the present series by two males and one female from Sulphur Springs, September 18-28, 1904; three males and two females from Raleigh, August 15 to September.
1904; a pair from New Berne, August 24, 1908, and a single female from Edenton, August 20, 1908.
These localities are the only ones in North Carolina at which the species has been captured.
Conocephalus brevipennis (Scudder).
Xiphidium brevipenne of authors.
A single female from Edenton, August 20, 1908, and another specimen of the same sex from New Berne, August 24, 1908, represent this well-known species.
With the addition of Brimley's Raleigh record one has all the known data on the occurrence of the species in North Carolina.
At Edenton it was taken in a wet drain and at New Berne it occurred in open meadow land.
Five males from Bayville.

At the former locality it occurred in low growth in mixed woods and at the latter among dune growth.
Conocephalus saltans (Scudder).

One male and three females from Sulphur Springs, September 18 to 28, 1904-1905, represent this species.
The only previous records for the southeastern States are from Raleigh.

Xiphidium nemorale of authors.
This easily recognized species is represented by a series of fifteen males and eight females, taken at Sulphur Springs, September 2 to October 6, 1904-1905.
( )ne female is long-winged, the bold pattern of the venation found in this species being proportionately more pronounced, giving this individual a peculiar appearance.
Both sexes vary considerably in size, but in no case does this seem to be decided enough to prevent ready recognition of the species.
This is the only record of the species from the South Atlantic States.
Odontoxiphidium apterum Morse.
A single female of this species from Winter Park, taken August 26 in high grass in a wet spot in pine woods, considerably extends the range of this species northward.
All the previously known records are of captures in Georgia and Florida.
The Winter Park specimen is somewhat smaller than Pablo Peach, Fla., individuals, but otherwise inseparable.
The specimen secured was the only one of the species seen.
Atlanticus dorsalis (Bunueister), Four females of this species taken at Sulphur Springs, September 24, 1904, constitute the first record of the species, occurrence in North Carolina.
The specimens were captured in the forest undergrowth and were the only ones noticed about the locality.
Attentions pachymerus (Burmeister).
A single male of this species was secured at an elevation of six thousand feet on Jones's Knob, Balsam Mountains, October 7, 1905.
It was taken in the forest undergrowth.

Nemobius fasciatus (Do Geer).
From a careful study of a considerable series of material belonging to this and the following form, it seems necessary to consider them but geographic races of one and the same species.
The evidence of intergradation is so great that it is almost impossible to place specimens from certain localities in one or the other of the two forms.
As the only character by which socius could be separated from fasciatus is the length of the ovipositor relative to that of the caudal femur, the following measurements of the female individuals in the present series,, in addition to some typical specimens of socius from other localities, mav be of interest.

One series consists of five females from Sulphur Springs, secured September 17 and 24, 1904, and thirteen males and four females from 4,500 feet elevation on Mt.
Pisgah, captured October 1, 1904.
A single female from Bayville, Va., August 19, 1908, has also been examined.
Of these specimens but one male is macropterous (Mt.
Pisgah) and but one female (Mt.
Pisgah) has tegmina almost as long as the body.
The Pisgah and Sulphur Springs lots each contain a single specimen having the ovipositor slightly shorter than the caudal femur, but as this is the exception and not the rule, we have considered the material from those localities to be N. fasciatus, while in our Raleigh series but one in seven has the ovipositor longer than the caudal femur, so we have placed the latter locality's representatives under N. fasciatus socius.
The specimens tabulated above show the following differences in the proportion of these two parts: Ovipositor longer ( + ) or shorter (—) than caudal femur.

The Sulphur Springs specimens are paler, more rufous and with more decided pattern than the other and more usual specimens.
These may represent N. canus Scudder, but the structural characters given for that form do not hold in the present specimens, so it seems more desirable to consider them slightly aberrant fasciatus.
A number of such pale colored individuals from Massachusetts, New Jersey and .Maryland have been examined by us.
Typical Nemobius fasciatus appears to be replaced in the entire Power Austral zone of the southeastern States by A r .
fasciatus socius although, as shown above, material from the borderland of the two forms is more or less intermediate in character.
Nemobius fasciatus socius Scudder.
This southern race of N. fasciatus is represented by two males and eight females from Raleigh, taken July 8-18, August 16-30 and September 2-20, 1904, and one male from New Berne, secured August 24, 1909.
Of this series one pair from Raleigh are macropterous, the remainder being brachypterous.
The Raleigh specimens were taken in pine woods, in stubble and broomstraw field, in grass around edge of marsh and at electric lights.
Nemobius maculatus Blatchley.
Two males from Sulphur Springs, taken September 24, 1904, and two individuals of the same sex from Raleigh, secured September 15, 1904, are referred to this species after comparison with typical Indiana material.
This is the first authentic record of the species for the southeastern States.
23 At Raleigh the species was taken at the edge of a marsh.
Nemobius oarolinus Scudder.
One male and two females from Balsam, taken at an elevation of 3,500 feet on October 7, 1905, and a pair from Raleigh, secured August 4 and September 5, 1904, represent this species.
The Raleigh specimens are somewhat larger than the Balsam individuals and the male proves the occurrence of macropterism in this species, the other representatives being of the usual brachypterous type.
At Raleigh the species was taken from under a plank in a garden and at light in house, while at Balsam the specimens were captured among damp grasses in the heavy deciduous forest.
The only previous North Carolina record is that of the types, which had no exact locality.
Gryllus pennsylvanicus Burmeister.
A series of six males and three females taken at Sulphur Springs, May 10-27 and June 5 and 13. are before us.
Gryllus neglectus Scudder.
Two males and two females taken at 4.500 feet elevation and on the summit bald of Mt.
Pisgah, October 1.
1904, are referable to this form, 23 The record of this species from Thomasville, Ga., made by the authors (Proc.
Acad.
Nat.

Phila., 1904, p. 799) is erroneous, the material having been brachypterous individuals of N. fasciatus socius.
42 which appears worthy of some designation whether specific or varietal.
The measurements of these specimens are as follows: Length of body 16.5 mm., 15.5 mm., 20 mm., 18 mm.
Length of tegmen 9 " 9.8 " 9 " 7.5 " Length of caudal femur 10 " 10.8 " 11 " 11.5 " Length of ovipositor 13 " 12.5 " The original measurements of this species for some reason are erroneous, this being the case with all the species of Gryllus measured in the same paper, 24 the dimensions being little more than half the usual size of the forms.
Allowance for this may cause the synonymizing with neglectus, of Blatchley's Gryllus amerieanus, the chief diagnostic characters of which, when compared w r ith pennsylvanicus and abbreviatus, were stated to be the slender build, short tegmina and ovipositor.
When compared with an authentic pair of amerieanus in the Academy's collection the Mt.
Pisgah individuals are slightly larger but otherwise inseparable.
Gryllus rubens Scudder.
This southern form is represented by a series of nine males and fourteen females from Raleigh, taken on dates ranging from April 16 to June 21 and also on September 7 and 13, 1904, a single male from Sulphur Springs taken June 5, a single male from Edenton, secured August 20 and one female from New Berne taken August 24.

The above-mentioned records are the first for the species from North Carolina.
At Raleigh it occurred in gardens, pastures, in broomstraw fields, in open places in woods and under rubbish, while at Edenton it was taken among weeds in a wet spot.
(Eoanthus angustipennis Fitch.
A single male from Sulphur Springs, taken September 29, 1904, is the first record of the species from North Carolina.
An immature individual secured at Bayville, Va., August 19, 1908, constitutes the first Virginia record for the species.
CEcanthus latipennis Riley.
A female individual in the istar preceding the adult condition taken August 19, 1998, at Bayville, Va., is the first record of the species in that State.

Four males and two females from Raleigh, taken June 29, August 30 and September 22.
1904, and one female from Sulphur Springs, September 24, 1904, represent this species.
At Raleigh it occurred on garden weeds, in broomstraw and in upland fields.
Two males and one female were taken in heavy tangles among low dunes at Cape Henry, Va., August 18, 1908, these constituting the first Virginia record for the species.
(Eoanthus nigricornis Walker.5 Two females taken at Raleigh, September 7 and 22, 1904. represent this rather robust species.
One was taken in an upland field, the other from alders along stream in pine woods.
This is the first record of the species from North Carolina.
Anaxipha exigua (Say).
Three males and two females taken at Raleigh, August 30 and September 9, 1904, belong to this species.
Two males and two females secured at Bayville, Va., August 19, 1908, constitute the first record of the species in the latter State.
At Raleigh it was captured in grasses around edge of swamp, while at Bayville it was taken in tall grass and brush in a wet spot in pine w r oods.
Phylloscyrtus pulchellus (Uhler).
This beautiful species is represented by three males and two females taken at Raleigh, September 9, 1904, and a single female captured at 25 We find it impossible to use the name fasciatus for this species, as Fitch did not propose it as a new name, but merely erroneously identified De Geer's Gryllus fasciatus which is clearly a Nemobius.
After examining the literature, we fully agree with previous authors who have reached this conclusion.
New Berne, August 24, 1904.
A pair from Bayville, Va., secured August 19, 190S.
are the first individuals of the species recorded from that State.
At Bayville it occurred in company with Anaxipha exigua in a grassy and bushy wet spot in pine woods; at New Berne it was captured in rank growth along a drain and at Raleigh it was also taken with Anaxipha on bushes bordering swampy land.
Hapithus agitator Uhler.
A pair of specimens from Raleigh, taken in pine woods September 7, 1904, are particularly interesting as they are practically intermediate between H. agitator and H. quad ml us.
There seems to be little doubt but that quadratics is a southern race of agitator, the differential characters being the greater size, the proportionately longer legs and more complex venation.
The Raleigh individuals have distinctly longer legs than specimens of true agitator, though their general relationship appears to be very slightly nearer the northern form.
Taken with the measurements already given by the authors, 26 the proportions of the Raleigh specimens may be of interest.

Only known from the above-described example taken many years ago in Santo Domingo with specimens of Albula vulpes (Lirmseus), of the same size and sex, differing chiefly as pointed out above.
Albula vulpes further differs in having the preopercular membrane extended back nearly to the gill-opening above, besides having the preopercle entirely inclined anteriorly along its hind edge and ridge.
Albula also shows other minor differences, such as the aperature of the adipose eyelid, a simple opening and not folded over below, snout much shorter, and the eye more median in the head length.
The accompanying figure is shown with the caudal fin restored, the tips of which are now damaged.

NOTES ON SOME LITTLE-KNOWN FISHES FROM THE NEW YORK DEVONIAN.
BY BURNETT SMITH.
Machceracanthus and other Fish Remains from the Oriskany Sandstone.
— So far as the writer has been able to learn the literature of Paleontology contains no reference to the occurrence of fish remains in the Oriskany sandstone of New York.
Beyond the boundaries of the State fossils of this nature have been reported from beds which are believed to be contemporaneous with the type Oriskany.
Eastman 1 mentions the scales of Thelodus from "Oriskany sandstone" at Nictaux Falls, N. S., while Newberry, 2 in his monograph makes the following statement : " Neither in New York nor farther south has the Oriskany sandstone yet furnished any remains of fishes, but it is to be expected that when sought for patiently and discriminatingly they will be discovered.
In Canada, north of Lake Erie, where the characteristic fossils of the New York Oriskany are associated with those of the Corniferous limestone, spines of Machceracanthus and fragments of plates with a stellate tuberculation, probably of MacropetaJiehthys, have been found."
In the vicinity of Syracuse, N. Y., the presence of bone fragments and of spines in the phosphatic nodules of the Oriskany has been known to local collectors for some time.
Several years ago Mr. Charles E. Wheelock, of Syracuse, obtained a spine from one of these concretions at Britton's quarry, Onondaga County (just south of the Syracuse city line).
This specimen has unfortunately been lost, but the writer feels that he can accept without reserve the determination of so careful an observer as Mr. Wheelock.
In 1908, Mr. Charles Hares, then a graduate student at Syracuse University, while studying the stratigraphic relations of the Oriskany sandstone, brought to my notice a number of fragmentary fossils from the phosphatic nodules at the quarries east of Manlius, Onondaga County.
With the exception of a few obscure pieces of bone, some collected 1 New York State Museum Memoir 10, p. 13.
2 Monographs U. S. G. S., vol.
XVI, p. 25. from the rock in place and one from a drift boulder, no other specimens have until recently come to the attention of the writer.
It is to Mr. Wheelock that we are again indebted for the discovery of additional and better preserved material.
This latter, together with two of the Manlius specimens, allow of the determination of one genus, Machcer acanthus, with certainty, and it is believed that characters differing from those of previously described species indicate that the form in question is new.
It is not, however, thought advisable to introduce a new specific name, for it is possible that the features observed may be merely the result of individual variation in some longknown species of the genus.

— A and B, proximal cross sections, and C, distal cross section of Machmracanthus spines from the Oriskany sandstone of Onondaga County, New York.
B and C are sections of the same spine.
All are enlarged twice.
The Oriskany Ma cheer acanthus may be briefly described as follows : Spines having a measured width of 16.5 mm.
Length probably exceeding 100 mm.
This would lie a spine of about the size of M. peracutus Newb.
and M. sulcatus Newb., but much smaller than M .
major Newb.
The angle of convergence of the sides of the spine is less than in any of the above-mentioned species, one measurement showing that the width decreases from 10 mm.
to 3 mm.
through a length of 54 mm.
The curvature is apparently about the same as that met with in M. peracutus.
Central cavity large.
The cross section of the spine is highly characteristic and changes greatly in its outline distally.
In the more proximal portions the spine is marked by very sharp "wings" and an angulated ridge is present on the outer (?)
side while the inner (?)
carries a much rounded and swollen ridge.
Distally the "wings" are shorter, while the two ridges, though still maintaining their general character, become less pronounced.
External surface punctate with distally convergent stria?.
These Oriskany specimens are distinguished from those previously described by the cross section.
In this feature they most resemble M .

Location and Horizon — Oriskany sandstone; Manlius and Britton's Quarry, Onondaga County, New York.

The specimens from the vicinity of Syracuse definitely extend the range of the genus to the Oriskany sandstone and, as stated before, probably represent a new species.
We know, however, practically nothing of the morphology of Machceracanthus, and if, as has been suggested, it is a gigantic Acanthodian, the probability is strong that even in one individual spines might have occurred whose curvatures and cross sections differed greatly.
In addition to the fossils assignable to Machceracanthus, the Manlius locality has yielded other though much less satisfactory fish remains.
These are so poorly preserved that little can be said of them beyond the fact that they present the appearance of badly weathered Arthrodiran plates.
Note on the Plates of Dinichthys hahnodeus (Clarke)?
— The structure of the abdominal armor in Coccosteus and especially in C. decipiens Ag.
has been well understood for many years.
The other genera of Arthrodires, however, seldom furnish us with anything but scattered plates, and this is more particularly true of the ventral shield.
In 4 New York State Museum Memoir 10, p. 191.
Dinichthys Eastman, 5 Dean 6 and Yon Koenen 7 have described more or less complete specimens of the ventral covering with its elements in nearly the positions occupied during the life of the animal.
In these cases the several species of Dinichthys, to which the ventral shields have been referred, are typical examples of the genus.
The ventral armor of the primitive species usually included in Dinichthys (such as D. halmodeus) has until recently remained unknown.
In the summer of 1908 the writer was so fortunate as to obtain a specimen of the ventral armor of a small arthrodire from the Marcellus shale (Middle Devonian) of central New York.
Although no definite specific determination has been attempted, it is highly probable that the specimen in question represents the plastron of Dinichthys halmodeus (Clarke).
Though originally described as Coccosteus, 8 most recent authors have included this species in Dinichthys, all agreeing, however, that it holds a position only slightly removed from the former ancestral genus.
The chief reasons for assigning this armor to D. halmodeus are (1) similarity of superficial tuberculation, (2) geographical and geological position, and (3) the fact that this ventral shield possesses just such primitive characters as would naturally correspond with those exhibited by the dorsal plates and head shields of the type material of the species.
A detailed description of this ventral shield has been given elsewhere, 9 and for our present purposes it is sufficient to say that the plates are in their original position, the antero-ventromedian and postero-ventromedian, both postero-ventrolaterals, and one anteroventrolateral are practically entire, while the other antero-ventrolateral is mostly retained.
The outline of this latter plate can, however, be restored from that of its well-preserved fellow on the other side.
In addition to these ventral plates the specimen shows both the antero-dorsolaterals and the right postero-dorsolateral.
Two other bones associated with those already named were originally regarded as a probable suborbital and as a possible antero-superognathal.

660 [Dec, more careful examination of these bones has led the author to reconsider these provisional determinations and to come to the conclusion that the elements in question are in no way connected with the headshield, but are part of the "clavicular" and lateral armoring.

Fig.
2 A represents a tracing taken from the photograph of the original specimen.
The plates of the ventral shield are all capable of certain identification, as are also the two antero-dorsolaterals and the postero-dorsolateral.
Immediately forward of the ventral shield is a group of bones which at first appear to be hopelessly confused.
If, however, we examine Traquair's 10 restoration of Coccostcus decipiens Ag\, we find that in this region occur two well-defined transverse elements which are terminated at their outer extremities by processes which are directed backward and upward.
In the specimen here considered it can be proved b} r a careful examination of impressions on the matrix that the bone originally believed to be an anterosuperognathal is not a short compact element, but is in reality a fragment once connected with a long transverse bone which borders the anterior margin of the left antero-ventrolateral.
The part believed to be a gnathal then becomes the upwardly and backwardly directed fork of the interlateral shown in Traquair's restoration of Coccosteus decipiens.
The evidence for this interpretation is twofold — (1) the shape of the bone corresponds to the Coccostean interlateral and (2) the bone is in exactly the position where we might expect to find such an element.
In Coccosteus decipiens this interlateral plate has a rodlike ventral portion and a lateral .portion with its two processes, one directed dorsally, the other posteriorly.
Between these two processes fits the lowest plate of the lateral armoring, namely, the anterolateral.
This anterolateral articulates behind with the small posterolateral and above it overlaps the antero-dorsolateral.
It therefore serves to link the ventral to the dorsal shield.
If, now, we turn to the higher species of Dinichthys, such as D. intermedins Newb., we find that apparently the Coccostean interlateral, the Coccostean anterolateral and perhaps even the Coccostean posterolateral have fused together into one large bone, the so-called "clavicular."
We say apparently, for though some specimens exhibit the condition shown in Newberry's classic illustration, 11 others occur with the two components (the lower rodlike portion and the upper platelike portion) separate.
Eastman 12 has homologized the broad portion of the "clavicular" with the Coccostean anterolateral and its lower portion with the Coccostean interlateral.
Though not wushing to express too hasty an opinion, the author believes that the restoration of Dinichthys would present fewer difficulties if we could regard the lower (interlateral) portion of the " clavicular" as an element distinct from the upper (anterolateral) portion.

Considering, now, the specimen dealt with in this paper, we find that the interlateral shows no positive evidence of fusion with any other bone and seems to agree with the condition met with in Coccosteus decipiens.
Further, it may be stated that its posterior margin looks as if it might have carried the thin blade found in D. intermedins, but the condition of preservation hardly warrants a final decision on this point.
If, now, we examine the plate which was at first believed to be a suborbital, we find that it is apparently onby a part of a larger bone, the fragments of which lie (in the figure) to the left of the big mass.
When a reconstruction of this bone is attempted, its outline is, in a general way, quite similar to that made by the combined anteroand posterolaterals of Coccosteus or the broadly expanded upper portion of the "clavicular" in Dinichthys.
The author offers the suggestion, therefore, that this bone probably represents a lateral plate of some kind.
In support of this suggestion it may be said that the bone in question occupies just such a position as that in which we might expect to find a lateral plate when the entire abdominal armor is so crushed that the dorsal and ventral plates are brought into the same plane.
According to this hypothesis, the plate was not only brought into the horizontal plane, but also rotated forward through an angle of about ninety degrees.
The same pressure pushed the left anterodorsolateral backward while it turned over with its outer side exposed.
The right antero-dorsolateral in coming to rest in the same plane with the others was pushed far forward of its natural position.
Though realizing that any conclusions in regard to the strictly lateral armoring which ma}be based upon this specimen are only tentative, the author believes that he may safely express the opinion that the interlateral in this Marcellus Dinichthyid occupies practically its normal position, that in this respect it agrees with Coccosteus, and that it offers a clue which may be of importance in properly orienting the "clavicular" (be it one element or two) in the higher Dinichthyids.
Acanthodian Remains from the Marcellus Shale.
— These remains of Acanthodians are quite fragmentary, but the extreme rarity of the members of this order in the Paleozoic strata of North America render advisable a short description of these two Middle Devonian specimens.
( )ne specimen collected by the writer came from the Marcellus shale of the Kimber Springs Ravine, southwest of Onondaga Valley, N. Y.
It comprises but a single spine less than 15 mm.
in length.
The proximal portion is imperfect, but clistally it tapers off in a graceful curve to the nearly complete point.
Three longitudinal grooves and ridges are plainly visible.
The other specimen was collected from the Marcellus shale of Richfield, N. Y., by the late Prof. C. E. Beecher.
It forms part of the Newberry Collection at the American Museum of Natural History.
Newberry was fully aware of the nature of the fossil, for he refers to Acanthodian remains very briefly on page 61 of his monograph as having been collected by Beecher from this horizon.
Subsequent authors have not mentioned it.
This Richfield specimen displays a spine, numerous scales and an undetermined plate.
The fossil lies in a bedding plane of the thinly laminated shale in such a way that when the block was broken a portion of the fish adhered to the rock on either side.
An examination of the spine indicates that the Richfield and Kimber Springs specimens are specifically identical.
The spine, though less perfectly preserved, exhibits the same proportions, curve and longitudinal ridges.
When complete it must have been over 33 mm.
in length.
The scales are relatively large, four-sided and apparently unsculptured.
The specimen is of good size for an Acanthodian, and though any estimate of its length must be very rough, we are undoubtedly justified in assuming that the complete fish was at least 175 mm.
long.
Though Acanthodian remains have been reported from the Lower and Upper Devonian of the Atlantic Border province and from the Upper Devonian of the New York province, these specimens represent the earliest examples of undoubted Acanthodians which have been found in the latter region.
In the Atlantic Border province the following forms have been reported: 13 Acanthodes semistriatus Woodward, Cheiracanthus costellatus Traquair, Climatius latispinosus (Whiteaves) from the Lower Devonian of Campbellton, N. B., and Diplacanthus striatus Ag., D. horridus Woodward, Acanthodes a/finis Whiteaves, A. concinnus Whiteaves from the Upper Devonian of Scaumenac Bay, Quebec.
In the New York province we have: Acanthodes (?)

43 BERMUDA SHELLS.
BY E. G. VANATTA.
The following lists are based upon land shells collected by Mr. Stewardson Brown during 1905, 1908, 1909; and land and fresh-water shells collected by E. E. Vanatta and the author during 1910.
All the species listed are recent specimens now in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
It is interesting to have found living examples of some of Mr. A. Gulick's fossil species, showing that they are not very old, especially since one proved to belong to the Old World genus Kaliella.
Separate lists of the various localities are given, as the distribution of some of the species seems to be local and not general.
It is to be hoped that future collectors will not mix the specimens from the different islands.
Messrs. Boyer and Keeley examined the diatoms which we gathered at Pembroke Marsh and pronounced them all fresh-water forms.

Sixteen meetings have been held during the year with an average attendance of twentyfive.
Communications were made by Benjamin Sharp, Henry Leffmann, William M. Wheeler, Henry A. Pilsbiy, John M. Macfarlane, John W. Harshberger, Thomas H. Montgomery, Henry W. Fowler, Arthur Erwin Brown, Edward J. Nolan, Charles S. Boyer, Thomas S. Stewart, Hugo Bilgram, Silas Shumo, Frank J. Keeley, T. Chalkley Palmer, William B. Davis, William H. Van Sickel, Henry Skinner, Chester A. Reeds, Edgar T. Wherry, F. Lynwood Garrison, W r itmer Stone, Samuel N. Rhoads, and Miss N. H. Wardle.
But few of these were reported for publication.
Thirty-three papers were presented for publication, as follows: Henry W. Fowler, 6; Henry A. Pilsbry, 3; James A. G. Rehn and Morgan Hebard, 3; James A. G. Rehn, 2; T. Chalkley Palmer, 2; R. Southern, 1 ; Bryant Walker, 1 ; Harold Sellers Coulton, 1 ; H. A. Pilsbry and J. H. Ferris, 1 ; H. A. Pilsbry and A. P. Brown, 1 ; C. S. Sargent, 1; Margaret Harris Clark, 1; Henry W. Fowler and Richard J. Phillips, 1 ; J. Perc} r Moore, 1 ; Edward J. Nolan, 1 ; Thomas Barbour, 1 ; Katherine J. Busch, 1 ; Francis W. Pennell, 1 ; Clarence B. Moore, 1; Edgar F. Smith, 1; T. D. A. Cockerell, 1, and Burnett Smith, 1.
Thirty-one of these have been printed in the Proceedings, one has been returned to the author, another (by Mr. Clarence B. Moore) forms the second part of the fourteenth volume of the quarto Journal.
The number is beautifully illustrated and the Academy is again indebted to Mr. Moore for the entire cost of publication.
The following are the statistics of publication for the year: Proceedings, 720 pages and 43 plates; Journal, 110 pages and 20 plates; Entomological News, 484 pages and 14 plates; Transactions of the American Entomological Society (Entomological Section of the Academy), 306 pages and 4 plates; Manual of Conchology, 94 pages and 16 plates, making a total of 1,714 pages and 97 plates.
Seven members and three correspondents have been elected.
The deaths of sixteen members and five correspondents have been announced.
The Academy sustained a severe loss in the death of Dr. Arthur E. Brown, the senior Vice-President, whose services to the society were recognized in a minute of appreciation and regret placed on the records and published in the Proceedings.
The resignation of membership of C. H. Smyth, Jr., was accepted.
A resolution was adopted providing for the participation of the Academy in a meeting to be held by the American Philosophical Society for the reception of portraits of the late Isaac Lea and Henry C. Lea.
The President, Dr. Dixon, was requested to act as the Academy's representative on the occasion.
The Secretary has devoted such time as could be secured from routine work to the accumulation of material for the proposed detailed history of the Academy in course of preparation for the celebration of its Centenary in 1912.
The index to the publications Mill be completed on the issue of the last number of the Proceedings for 1910.
The alphabetical arrangement of the index to the genera and species, a rather trying piece of work, will be accomplished as promptly as possible, so that the supplementary volume may be issued in connection with the Centenary.
Edward J. Nolan, Recording Secretary.
REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY.
During the fiscal year just closed the roll of correspondents was changed by five deaths and three elections.
The deceased were Peter MacOwen, R. Bowdler Sharpe, Alexander Agassiz, Eduard Van Beneden and William H. Brewer.
Those elected are Prof. Edward B. Poulton, Prof. Thomas Hunt Morgan, and Dr. L. O. Howard.
The year was noteworthy for the many learned congresses and events of scientific interest in which the Academy was invited to participate.
Among the most important of these were the following: The Third International Congress of Botany; the International Institute of Agriculture; the Eighth International Zoological Congress; the Semicentennial Anniversary of the Entomological Society of Russia; the International Hygiene Exhibition at Dresden in 1911; the Eleventh International Geological Congress; the International Agro-geological Conference; the Seventeenth International Congress of Americanists; the First International Congress of Entomology; the Solvay Institute of Sociology; the Tenth International Congress of Geography and the American Association of Museums.
Most of these invitations were acknowledged by suitable letters expressive of the Academy's interest and appreciation.
Delegates, most of whom were in attendance at the meetings, were appointed as follows: To the Third International Congress of Botany, Prof. J. C. Arthur; to the Eleventh International Geological Congress, Dr. Richard A. F. Penrose and Dr. Edgar T. Wherry; to the Eighth International Zoological Congress, Prof. E. G. Conklin and Prof. Lndwig v. Graff, and to the First International Congress of Entomology, Dr. Henry Skinner.
A rather larger number than usual of letters requesting information or assistance were either answered by the Corresponding Secretary or referred to other officers of the Academy.
A tabulated statement of the correspondence for the year follows: Communications Received.

In view of the strictly special character of the library this should be regarded as a gratifying exhibit.
It represents the steady current growth of the collections, no large libraries having been received en bloc.
The separate pamphlets have not been counted, but an estimate has been made of the number of volumes those still unbound would make if arranged uniformly with the rest of the collection.
Many of the volumes in the library of the Entomological Section are duplicates of those on the shelves of the Academy.
There is an apparent falling off of 121 volumes on Conchology instead of an increase, but this is accounted for by the fact that the Conchological journals were formerly plaeed with the special books on that subject, whereas they have now been transferred to the section of Journals and Periodicals, where they properly belong.
Similarly some of the books in the Meigs Library have been removed from the miscellaneous collection, which is only retained because of a condition imposed by the donor, John G. Meigs.
1 The separated books have been placed with related works in the general library.
Special attention may be called to the following accessions: Nature Notes.
London.
Eighteen volumes.
Giornale Arcadico di Scienze, Roma.
Seventeen volumes.
Memoires de la Societe Geologique de France; Paleontologie.
Volumes V-XVI.
Annates de V Universite de Grenoble.
Twenty-one volumes.
Thurston's Castes and Tribes of Southern India.
Seven volumes.
Grote, Vogt and Hofer's Siisswasser Fische von Miiteleivropa.
George G. Heye Expedition, Contributions to South American Archceology.
The Academy is indebted to His Royal and Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Ludwig Salvator of Austria for the gift of twenty-three superbly illustrated volumes, the privately printed records of many years of travel and exploration.
The works relate for the most part to the geography, physical characters, ethnography and history of some of the islands of the Mediterranean Sea and are finely illustrated with hundreds of figures and plates.
The collection includes a beautiful panorama, twelve feet in length, of the Bay of Alexandrette, the ancient Alexandria ad Issum.
The books were secured through the active interest of the late Dr. Theodore de Thodorovitch, who, as a member of the Academy and in his official capacity as Austro-Hungarian Consul, represented the claims of the library as a depository of the desired works based on its importance to students of science and its liberality of administration.
It is a cause of sincere regret that the death of Dr. de Thodorovitch before the arrival of the volumes deprived the Academy of the opportunity of making to him the acknowledgment of obligation he so well deserved.
We are also indebted to the Hon.
Maurice Francis Egan, our Minister to Denmark, for his co-operation in securing by exchange the valuable publications of Dr. Wesenburg-Lund's Fresh-water Laboratory, which we were not able to procure through the booksellers.
The following new serials have been added to the library during the year : 1 See Report of Librarian for 1895.

In the course of a careful revision of the arrangement and cataloguing of the journals as now placed in the stacks, fifty numbers, nearly all unimportant, could not be found.
Some of these may be misplaced, although a careful search has been made for them, and others may be returned.
These were not reported in 1904 when the last account of stock was taken, because of the lack of a shelf-list of the section of Journals and Periodicals, so that the loss extends over an undetermined number of years.
Since that account was taken two works, then reported missing, have been returned, but sixteen others cannot be found.
It may be that some of these have been illegally borrowed and will be also brought back, but it is much to be feared that a volume of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey Reports, Catlin's Indians, edition of 1841, Jardine's Wilson's Ornithology, Wolle's Diatoms, Gurney's Distillation (of which the title-card was also stolen from the catalogue) and Chavasse's Advice to a Wife have been taken by the most detestably mean of all thieves, the one who appropriates for his own use what is being held for the general good.
It is believed that these losses were all incurred before the arrangement of the library in the stacks.
The Librarian attended the International Conference of Archivists and Librarians in Bruxelles, August 28-31.
The proceedings were not of much importance to the Academy, but the brief visit to Belgium, especially to the towns between Antwerp and Bruxelles, was full of delight and profit.
It gives the Librarian much pleasure to again acknowledge his indebtedness to his Assistant.
William J.
Fox, who, by his co-operation in the work of the Publication Committee, as well as of the Library, has afforded the opportunity for progress with the proposed detailed history of the Academy.
Efficient service has also been rendered by Furman Sheppard Wilde, who has been an assistant in the library since last February.
Edward J. Nolan, Librarian.
44 REPORT OF THE CURATORS.
The plans outlined in the Curators' report for 1909 for alterations in the exterior of the building, made possible by the appropriation of $60,000 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania at the last session of the Legislature, have been successfully carried out.
The walls of the original green-stone building have been encased in granite, brick and terra cotta, which effectually checks any further deterioration and makes this wing uniform in appearance with the new library wing on Cherry Street.
Granite and terra cotta facings have also been added to the middle brick building to bring it into harmonv with the other two.
A number of the windows have been altered with the object of furnishing additional light and conforming to the general architectural design, while new doorways have been constructed at the entrances on Race and Nineteenth Streets.
The results of the alterations are very satisfactory, making one harmonious building of the several wings that have been erected at different periods since the Academy first occupied its present site.
A slight alteration was made during the year in the library building, by which two office rooms on the gallery were thrown together, making a commodious Council room, to which the bookcases and other furnishings of the old Council room have been transferred.
Additional radiators were erected in the herbarium, and two laboratory tables and a number of rugs were purchased for the work-rooms and offices of the scientific staff.
The building operations which were in progress during the greater part of the year naturally interfered with any extensive rearrangement of the exhibits.
The north wing had to be closed entirely for several months and the cleansing and replacing of the cases have only just been completed.
In the middle wing the entire exhibition series of Mammals has been removed from the cases, the floors of which were then repainted and the specimens, after being carefully cleansed, were replaced.
The skeleton of the Indian Elephant "Bolivar" was articulated and placed beside the mounted skin, while several other large skeletons were remounted.
On the bird gallery the labelling of the exhibition collection was practically completed.
In addition to the work on the Mammals and Osteological collection, Mr. McCadden, the taxidermist, has prepared a number of skins and skeletons for the study collection, including the skeleton of a Lesser Sperm Whale.
A large amount of research and routine work has been done by members of the staff in connection with the study collections as outlined in the accompanying special reports.
Beside this, Dr. J. P. Moore has cared for the collection of annelids and has studied and described the extensive collections dredged in the North Pacific by expeditions representing the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries, Leland Stanford University, and the University of California, from which the Academy receives duplicates.
Numerous other specimens of worms submitted by institutions and individuals have been identified.
Mr. H. W. Fowler has cared for the collection of fishes and, beside routine work, has critically studied and reidentified the batoid, chimseroid and ganoid fishes and part of the clupeoids, preparing seven papers for the Academy's Proceedings.
Mr. J.
A. G. Rehn, in the portion of his time devoted to Entomology, has studied the North Carolina Orthoptera in the Academy collection and that of Mr. Morgan Hebard and prepared a paper on the subject for the Proceedings, as well as on the collection of Georgia and Florida Orthoptera submitted by the Georgia State Entomologist, from which the Academy received duplicates.
He has likewise published a revision of the genus Ischnoptera.
Miss H.N.
Wardle has continued the cataloguing of the Archaeological collection.
The Curators are also indebted to Mr. E. T. Cresson, Jr., for aid in the entomological department, and to Messrs. S. S. Van Pelt and Bayard Long for voluntary work in mounting and caring for the local collection of plants.
A number of important field trips were taken during the year in the interest of the Academy.
Dr. H. A. Pilsbry spent several months in Arizona making collections of Mollusks, Reptiles and Plants.
Mr. Vanatta spent some weeks in Bermuda, and Dr. Moore was at Martha's Vineyard during the summer, both of them obtaining interesting invertebrate material, while Mr. Stewardson Brown, during a month's sojourn in Jamaica, secured a valuable series of the plants of the island.
Through the liberality of Mr. Morgan Hebard, Mr. Rehn was enabled to join him on another tour of the Western States in search of Orthoptera and a large collection was made in which the Academy shares.
Numerous local collecting trips were also taken by members of the staff.
Among the important accessions of the year may be mentioned the valuable unique specimens obtained by Mr. Clarence B. Moore during his continued investigations among the Indian mounds of the southern United States, for the accommodation of which Mr. Moore has presented another mahogany and plate-glass exhibition case.
Dr. Amos P. Brown has presented an extensive series of mollusks obtained by him during several trips to Jamaica during the year, and Mr. Joseph Crawford, who accompanied him on one trip, has presented a collection of Jamaican plants.
The H. H. Smith 1905-09 collections of fresh-water mollusks of Alabama were obtained by purchase, and a collection of birds from Chihuahua, Mexico, was presented by Dr. William E. Hughes.
A number of mammals were also received from the Zoological Society of Philadelphia.
Thirty-one storage cases and two hundred insect boxes were procured during the year.
There has been a good attendance of visitors to the Museum, especially on Sunday afternoons, and a marked increase is noticeable in the number of school classes which have visited the institution under the charge of their teachers.
A number of visiting specialists have made use of the study collections during the year in the various departments of the Museum, and specimens have been loaned to the following: W. W. Eggleston, L. W. Riddle, Bayard Long, Ivar Arividson, W. E. Clyde Todd, Robert Ridgway, P. Wytsman, C. H. Eigenmann, D. G. Elliot and J. C. Merriam.
Samuel G. Dixox, Henry A. Pilsbry, WlTMER STOXE, Curators.
Report of the Departmext of Mollusca, During the past year continued progress has been made in the arrangement of the study collections of mollusks.
About half of the alcoholic series has been overhauled and classified in the new storage cases.
No work has been done on the display collection owing to building operations.
Over 4,000 lots have been added to the collection, the number of individual specimens being estimated at over 25.000.
Among the more interesting gifts to the collection the following may be mentioned : series of Jamaican and Panamic land snails collected by Dr. Amos P. Brown ; South American shells sent by Dr. H. von Ihering of the Museu Paulista, Brazil, and a series from the Kaibab and Kanab plateaus, Arizona, collected by Messrs. J. H. Ferriss and L. E. Daniels in 1909.
Mr. Clarence B. Moore and Mr. Y. Hirase have continued to contribute valuable material.
Through illness the Department was deprived of the services of Mr. Vanatta during six months of the year, but he took advantage of the period of convalescence to collect an extensive and valuable series of the mollusks of Bermuda.
Mr. Vanatta has demonstrated that Bermuda has a fresh-water fauna containing no less than five genera of mollusks.
Hitherto it has been supposed that no native fresh-water mollusks existed there.
Work on the Manual of Coxchology has been directed to the Hawaiian family Achatinellidce.
Papers have been published by the Special Curator during the year on the mollusks of Mexico; of the Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona; on land mollusks of Panama, and of Jamaica (in collaboration with Dr. Brown) ; on Haitian Oligocene fossils, etc.
Mr. Vanatta has prepared a paper on the mollusks of Bermuda for publication in the Proceedings.
The Special Curator spent three months, beginning August loth, in the exploration of southern New Mexico and Arizona, in company with Messrs. Ferriss and Daniels.
The Hachita Grande, Santa Rita, Baboquivari, Dragoon and other mountain ranges were studied.
It is believed that the observations made will add materially to our knowledge of the zoogeography of the arid southwest.
The collections are also interesting systematically, since a large number of species new to science was encountered.

REPORTS OF THE SECTIONS.
Biological and Microscopical Section.
Nine regular and eight informal meetings have been held during the year, with the usual attendance.
The membership is the same in number as last year, one resignation having occurred and one new member being admitted.
In accordance with custom, the proceedings at the meetings have consisted chiefly of oral communications, in which each member present has shared, of microscopical studies, many of which have represented original work.
It is to be regretted that in an association composed of amateurs Avhose time is limited work of much scientific value is impossible.
There are lines, however, along which the Section may direct good work and it is suggested that a descriptive catalogue of the local cryptogamic flora, not heretofore published, be attempted, in conjunction, possibly, with other Sections of the Academy.
Among papers presented and published are two by Mr. T. Chalkley Palmer: A New Diatom, and Stauroneis Terryi.
At a special meeting of the Section held in April, in the Library of the Academy, an exhibition of microscopical objects was presented to a large audience.
A number of papers also were read and are noted in the Proceedings.
The officers elected for the ensuing year are as follows: Director J. Cheston Morris, M.D.
Vice-Director T. Chalkley Palmer.
Recorder Charles S. Boyer.
Treasurer Thomas S. Stewart, M.D.
( 'urator F. J. Keeley.
Corresponding Secretary Silas L. Schumo.
Charles S. Boyer, Recorder.
Entomological Section.
The scientific communications made to the Section during the year have been published in the Entomological News.
This journal has completed its twenty-first volume with the December number for this year.
For 1910, 484 pages and 14 plates were issued.
The usual meetings of the Section have been held, with an average attendance of nine persons.
Two members and two associates have been elected.
The additions to the collection have been numerous.
Mr. Morgan Hebard presented 1,047 specimens of Orthoptera and 3,605 specimens of the same order were purchased by the Academy.
In all 5,957 insects were added to the collections.
One hundred and fifty boxes have been acquired to accommodate this growth.
The safety and rearrangement of the collection has had the usual care, and with the improvement in cases and boxes the danger from museum pests has been greatly decreased.
The entire exotic series of Orthoptera, the North American Forficuliche.
Blattidse, Mantida?, Phasmidae and Gryllidae have been rearranged, together with the duplicate Hymenoptera, the collection of galls and the Dipterous family Stratiomyidse.
A large part of the Micro-lepidoptera has been relaxed and mounted and nearly the entire series of North American Rhopalocera has been rearranged.
Much of the Hemiptera has been recently studied and named by a specialist.
The incorporation of the additions to the collection has taken much time, and the Section is indebted to those students not directly responsible for the work.
Mr. Rehn has had charge of the Orthoptera and Dr. Calvert has continued to care for the large and valuable collection of Odonata.
Mr. E. T. Cresson is working on the arrangement of parts of the collection of Hymenoptera.
The Conservator represented the Academy at the First International Entomological Congress, held in Brussels, Belgium, last August.
This meeting demonstrated the great importance of entomology from a practical or economic standpoint, particularly that branch of economic entomology relating to the dissemination of disease by insects and the carriage of germ diseases to man.
The following persons were elected officers to serve for the ensuing year : Director Philip Laurent.
Vice-Director H. W. Wenzel.
Treasurer E. T. Cresson.
Conservator Henry Skinner.
Recorder Henry Skinner.
Secretary E. T. Cresson, Jr.
Publication Committee E. T. Cresson, E. T. Cresson, Jr. Botanical Section.
Five double wooden cases, which had to be moved from the north room owing to the change of windows on Race Street, were transferred to the local herbarium, the plants contained in them being moved into new dustand insect-proof metal cases.
But little work has been done on the arrangement of the herbarium owing to the remodelling of the building, though the preparation and mounting of specimens has gone on with but little interruption.
Some important additions have been made to the collections during the year.
The Conservator spent about a month in Jamaica and brought back a collection of more than 850 sheets.
Mr. Joseph Crawford spent about the same length of time in Panama and Jamaica, adding about S00 sheets, and more than 100 sheets from Jamaica and Cuba have been received in exchange from the New York Botanical Garden.
On the Academy's expedition to Arizona and New Mexico, in the latter part of the year, Dr. Pilsbry collected nearly 800 sheets of plants, and 640 sheets, principally from Nevada and California, have been purchased by the Section from Mr. A.
A. Heller.
Other collections, aggregating about 400 sheets, have been received from B. H. Smith, Dr. C. D. Fretz, Witmer Stone and Charles S. Williamson.
The work in the local herbarium has been carried on with greater effect than during any previous year, the 3,511 sheets added by the members of the Philadelphia Botanical Club having been mounted and distributed by Mr. Samuel S. Van Pelt.
Much valuable work, especially in studying some of the more complex groups, has been done by Mr. Bayard Long.
During the year a small printing outfit was added to the equipment of the herbarium, resulting in the saving of much time and labor in label writing, besides insuring uniformity in style and size of labels.
Acknowledgment is here made of the continued assistance in the herbarium during the year of Miss Ada Allen.
At the annual meeting of the Section, held on December 6, the following were elected as officers for the year : Director Benjamin H. Smith.
Vice-Director Joseph Crawford.
Secretary and Recorder Charles S. Williamson.
Treasurer and Conservator Stewardson Brown.
Respectfully submitted, Stewards* >n Brown, Conservator.
MlNERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL SECTION.
The Section has this year held five meetings, besides meeting once (May 17) in conjunction with the Academy.
Communications were made by Mr. S. L. Schumo, with his own photographic illustrations, on pot-holes at the Falls of Schuylkill; by Prof. Chester A. Reeds, on the geology of the Arbuckle Mountains, Oklahoma; by Dr. Edgar T. Wherry, on copper deposits of Franklin and Adams Counties, Pa., besides various shorter communications and discussions.
There were seven field excursions of the Section, with an average attendance of about twenty-five.
The excursions visited: (1) The crystalline rocks, old Paleozoic rocks and a trap dike near Lafayette, Marble Hall and Spring Mill, Montgomery County; (2) The crystalline rocks south of West Chester ; (3) The New Red and crystalline rocks near Langhorne, Bucks County; (4) The crystalline rocks between Newtown Square and Wallingford, Delaware County; (5) The minerals and fossils near Mullica Hill, N. J. ; (6) The crystalline rocks near Paoli and Castle Rock, Delaware County ; (7) The New Red rocks near the Buckingham Mountain fault, in Bucks County.
The membership of the Section has increased by one associate member.
The following officers of the Section have been elected for the year 1911: Director Benjamin Smith Lyman.
Vice-Director Frank J. Keeley.
Recorder and Secretary S. L. Schumo.
Treasurer William B. Davis.
Conservator George Vaux, Jr. Respectfully submitted by order of the Section.
Benjamin Smith Lyman, Director.
Ornithological Section.
As was the case last year, work in the Ornithological department has been seriously handicapped by the absence of Mr. Rehn in the West during three months and the general curatorial work that has devolved upon the Conservator.
Nevertheless, much progress has been made in the arrangement of the collection.
All of the remaining mounted birds, with the exception of the humming-birds, have been identified and labelled, practically completing this important piece of work.
In the study collection all of the families of Passerine birds from the thrushes to the crows, comprising some 450 drawers of skins, have been reidentified and rearranged, while all the species represented in the collection have been checked off in Sharpe's Hand List of Birds, so that it will soon be possible to see at a glance exactly what species the Academy possesses in each family.
Labels have also been placed on all the drawers as far as the Turdidae.
Twelve metal cases were procured during the year, part of which were used in the rearrangment of the Passeres, while the others were allotted to the type specimens, which were carefully examined and rearranged systematically.
Among the important accessions of the past year may be mentioned the local collection of Mr. F. Guy Meyers, a valuable series of Chihuahuan birds presented by Dr. William E. Hughes, and a series of Costa Rican birds obtained by purchase.
The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club, Spencer Baird Ornithological Club and Pennsylvania Audubon Society have held their meetings at the Academy during the year.
The Conservator is indebted to Mr. J.
A. G. Rehn for valuable assistance in cataloguing and for preparing the labels for the mounted birds, and to Mr. E. J. F. Marx, of the Delaware Valley Club, who spent several veeks as voluntary assistant in rearranging portions of the collection.
At the annual meeting the following officers were elected.
Director Spencer Trotter, M.D.
Vice-Director George Spencer Morris.
Recorder Stewardson Brown.
Secretary William A. Shryock.
Conservator and Treasurer Witmer Stone.
