THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMPARATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE GIZZARD IN THE ODONATA ZYGOPTERA.
BY HELEN T. HIGGINS.
The following study^ was undertaken on the advice and under the direction of Dr. Philip P. Calvert, instructor in Zoology in the University of Pennsylvania.
Dr. Ris' work on the gizzard of the Odonata and Dr. Calvert's study of Californian forms strongly suggested the phylogenetic importance of this organ.
The present study has been limited to the more primitive Odonata — the suborder Zygojjtera.
I am indebted to Dr. Calvert for the material placed at my disposal, for many of my preparations, including his slides used in his paper of 1899 mentioned later, for the determination of genus and species in every case, and for the suggestion of the structural formula used in describing the gizzards.
In 1890, Dr. F. Ris published" a paper entitled Untersuchungen ' iiber die Gestalt des Kaumagens bei den Lihellen and ihren Larven.
The results of his investigations are briefly outlined here: In the Odonata the fore-gut extends to the third abdominal segment.
In larva and imago alike the gizzard is found at the posterior end of the fore-gut in the second abdominal segment.
It is formed by a thickening of the muscle layer, and by a modification of the chitinous coat of the fore-gut to form folds armed with teeth.
The number of these folds is four, eight or sixteen.
The metamorphosis to the imago shows a regular reduction in the strength and complication of the elements, but their number varies greatly.
At the metamorphosis, the larval lining is shed with the chitinous coat of the exterior of the body; Dr. Ris states that he found in a Lihellula, directly after metamorphosis, the old gizzard lining enclosed within the new.
He examined the larval and adult ^ Accepted by the Uliiversity of Pennsylvania as a thesis for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Biology, June, 1900.

The conclusions drawn by Dr. Ris from his investigations are as follows : Larvce.
— The original form of the gizzard shows a division into sixteen longitudinal folds, eight broad and eight narrow, which bear an armature of irregularly placed teeth.
This type is found in the Calopterygince.
A higher development of the organ appears in the typical group of the Agrionince ; the sixteen folds show a greater number of teeth and a more complicated arrangement of these.
The legion Lester shows a reduction of the sixteen folds to eight, apparently through the loss of the smaller folds.
These eight folds are again divided into four broad and four narrower folds.
In i\\e Anisoptera {Gomphus and jE-ichna) there is reduction to four equal, similar folds.
Finally, Corditlegaster and the Libellulidce differentiate the folds into two pairs of teeth, so that the original radial symmetry is changed to bilateral.
Tmagos.
— The series easily traced in the larval forms is somewhat confused in the images, owing to the reduction which invariably occurs.
The least reduction from larva to adult is found in the Calopterygince; more is shown in the Agrionince, where is seen the tendency to eliminate the smaller fold in certain individuals; the strongest reduction occurs in Gomphus and jEschna; in Cordulegaster and in the Libellulidce scarcely more than a hint of the relation to the larva remains.
This purely morphological development from the radial symmetry of numerous elements of an organ to the bilateral symmetry of a few elements runs parallel with the phylogenetic relationships of the single groups.
In a paper on the Odonata from Tepic, Mex.,* 1899, Dr. Calvert gives notes on the gizzards of the forms studied by him.
Contrary to Dr. Ris and other previous writers, he finds the position of the junction of foreand mid-gut, and therefore of the ^Proc.

Dr. Ris and Dr. Calvert agree generally on the morphology of the forms studied by both.
They differ, however, in the phylogenetic position of the legion Lestes.
Dr. Calvert does not draw any phylogenetic conclusions from his studies, considering the examination of many more forms necessary before this can safely be done.
Preparation of Present Material.
— The present study has been based upon representatives of the sub-families Calopterygince and Agrionince collected from every continent.
The preparations have largely been made from dried^ specimens.
From these the abdomens were cut off at the base of the third segment and soaked in seventy per cent, alcohol until softened.
Some of these, even after long soaking, were so brittle that only fragments of the gizzard could be mounted.
In cases where, because of its fragmentary condition, the structure of the gizzard is at all doubtful, I have put an interrogation point after the descriptive formula.
The remainder of the material studied had been preserved in alcohol or formaline.
To obtain and prepare the chitinous lining of the gizzard for study, the abdomen was slit open along one of the membranous pleura, the gizzard located, and separated from the rest of the ahmentary canal by a fine pair of scissors.
The gizzard was cut open, the muscular coat removed with nesdles, aad the chitiuous lining spread out flat upon a slide.
After cleaning, this was mounted in Canada balsam, making a very distinct preparation for study.
In nearly every case the dried specimens from which the gizzards have been removed have been again put together, so that their value as ordinary museum material has been little, if at all, impaired.
The larvae studied belong mainly to the sub-family Agrioninoc.
They were collected from the vicinity of Philadelphia and were either fresh or preserved in alcohol.

report of the meeting of the Academy of Natural ficieuces of Philadelphia of January 17, 1899, in Science, Vol.
IX, p. 183.
Development of the Gizzard.
The gizzard is a specially thickeued aud cuticularized portion of the alimentary canal, appearing at the junction of foreand midgut, and projecting slightly into the latter.
Externally is a coat of circular muscle fibres, thicker in the larvaj than in the adult and varying in thickness in adults of different genera.
Within is a layer of epithelial cells, at first one cell in thickness, but later becoming many cells thick in definite areas, to form folds projecting into the lumen of the canal.
In the forms examined, four folds or some mvdtiple of four to as many as thirty-two have been found — sixteen and eight being the numbers most commonly occurring.
From the epithelial cells is developed the inner chitinous coat of the gizzard, which is thin on the spaces between folds, becoming thickened on the folds aud forming here horny teeth of various sizes.
The writer has examined Agrionine larvie from the time of hatching to the period immediately preceding metamorphosis.
In larvffi just hatched no evidence of any gizzard-armature was found.
The following statements refer to larvte of Ischnura verticalis Say: In larviB 3 and 4 mm.
in length' the gizzard is quite clearly marked (fig.
25).
The chitinous coat shows sixteen folds or fields, eight larger alternating with eight smaller.
Each larger field is armed with teeth arranged in two groups, an anterior and a posterior, the latter occupying about the centre of the gizzard.
The posterior group consists of two large pointed teeth, each enclosed on its outer side by four to five small teeth.
The anterior group comprises two pointed narrow teeth intermediate in size between the two sets mentioned above.
Each smaller field has one group of three to four sjuall teeth, ■which are at the same level as that of the posterior group of the larger fields.
A larva 6 mm.
long shows practically the same armature, but on the smaller fields also there are often two groups, the anterior comprising one to two teeth, the posterior three to four. '
In all of these larvae, by length 1 meau the distance measured from the external anterior part of the head to the posterior limit of the last abdominal segment, the gills being excluded.
A larva 8 mm.
long gliows considerable difference in the size and number of the teeth (PL IV, fig.
2(i).
The anterior groups of both fields show an increase in the number of teeth, which remain approximately the same in size.
In the posterior groups the smaller teeth show decrease in size with increase in number; the two large teeth of the larger fold remaining the same in size.
A larva of 10 mm.
length shows much the same structure.
Three larvte of 15 mm.
length show the same line of development carried a little further (fig, 27), an increase in number of the teeth of the anterior groups of both folds, slight increase in number with continued decrease in size of the small teeth of the posterior groups of both folds.
In all larvie studied the gizzard was found in the second abdominal seguient.
Young images of Ischnura verticalis were examined soon after metamorphosis.
In those dissected directly after the spreading of the wings only the larval gizzard was observed.
This lay in the sixth segment.
In an adult in which the coloring was distinctly developed, the larval gizzard lining lay immediately within that of the adult, which latter bore a very different armature (PI.
Ill, fig.
17).
In still other individuals the adult gizzard was in the sixth segment, while the lining of the larval gizzard and of the fore-gut of the larva, coiled up in a mass, lay in the lumen of the canal in the seventh segment.
These observations suggest the possibility of learning something of the structure of the gizzard of the larva) of exotic species by inspecting the contents of the alimentary canal of imagos whose colors show them to have but recently transformed.
To sum up the development of the gizzard lining in Ischnura verticals, it is seen that from its earliest appearance (which in the present study was found in a larva 3 mm.
long) there is a steady increase in the number of teeth on oil folds with a deciease in size in those of posterior groups.
At metamorphosis the gizzard moves backward from the second to the sixth abdominal segment.
A new chitinous coat is formed on the fore-gut, with a new gizzard armature.
The larval lining lying within the adult lining becomes loosened from it and finally separates entirely, and is found, within a few hours after metamorphosis, lying coiled up within the canal.
It is probable that in still older imagos the cast-ofi larval gizzard lining lies still further posterior in the canal, and is finally voided through the anus.
The Gizzard of Various Adults.
The position of the gizzard in the imago was found to vaiy from the third abdominal segment to the seventh.
In the majority of forms examined the gizzard lies in the centre or posterior extremity of the sixth segment; in a small number it lies in the fifth, in a still smaller in the seventh, and in a very few io the third or fourth segment.
Variat^'ons in the position are frequently found in different species of the same genus and even in different individuals of the same species.
A male of Caloj)tpryx apical'is had the gizzard in the anterior end of the sixth segment, a female in the centre of the fifth; while in a male of C. comelia it was located in the fifth segment.
In a male of Phaon iridijyennis the gizzard was found in the posterior end of the sixih segment; in a male of P. fuliginosus in the third, and in a female of the same species in the sixth segment.
In four species of Ve-sfalis the position varied only from the posterior end of the fifth to the middle of the sixth segment.
The same variation was seen in five species of Hetcerina, and likewise in four species of Euphcea.
In the 9 of Libellago ealigata the gizzard was found in the third segment, in tne d" in the fifth, and in L. curta, cf, in the fourth segment.
In four individuals — two species — of Micromerus it was found in the fifih; in Thore boliviana, c?, in the centre of the fifth, in ?
in anterior end of seventh; in Eutliore hyalina, d, in the anterior end of sixth, in $ in posterior end of fifth.
Of the Agrionince, legion Pseudostigma, its position varied in eight individuals, of five genera, from the middle of the sixth to the anterior extremity of the seventh segment; in the Legion Podagrion, in five males and one female of Paraphlebia sp.
(group of Zoe), the position varied only from the anterior end to the centre of the sixth segment; in five species of the genus Hettragrioii, from the posteiicr end of the fifth to the anterior of the seventh; in the legion Platycnemis, in four genera, the organ was found \n the sixth or seventh segment; in the \Qg\on Protoneura — in three species of DUparoneura, in three of Neoneura and in three of Protoneura — the same variation is seen, from the posterior end of the sixth to the anterior of the seventh; of the Legion Agrion it appears in the sixth segment in Hyponeura liigens, Ischnura heterodieta, Eiiallarjma ebrium, geminatum and aspersum, m Nehalentiia lal-<, Ceriagrion glahrum, Anlmgrion aUoptenim and JSemiphlebia mlrahiUs ; in the fifth in Argia jmtrida, Pyv' rhosoma tenellum; in the seventh in LepUAgrion macrurum and Leptohaais vacillam ; of the legion Le-ite-i it appears in the sixth segment in Lestes disjiuida and L. leda.
Armature of the Adult Gizzard.
To save the necessity of giving lengthy descriptions of the arraatui'e of each gizzard studied, and more especially to render the comparison of tliese armatures more easy, it was found convenient to construct a formula whereby the general structure of the armature might be indicated.
Below is given an explanation of the formulie used: F, F, f, indicate specially chitinized areas of the gizzard lining, whether they bear teeth or not.
They may stand as abbreviations of "field" ("Felder" of Ris) or '''fold."
When the fiekls are approximately alike only one size letter may be used — F ; when unlike, F will denote the largest sized areas, F medium sized, f small sized When the areas are of but two sizes F and f may be used.
Arabic figHrc-^ following F, f, f, denote the number of teeth borne by each field respectively; when the number is great (40 or more) n is used to denote this fact.
When in one and the same gizzard the teeth are of different sizes this is indicated by use of the marks ', ", '" ; ' denotes the largest sized teeth, " medium sized, '" smallest sized.
Wherever a gizzard consists of a repetition of similar fields, the formula may be shortened by enclosing the repeated arrangement within parentheses, and placing the proper coefficient before the parenthesis to indicate the number of times the repetition occurs.
When the same field contains two groups of teeth separated by a distinct interval, these two groups are indicated in the formula by placing one above the other with a horizontal line between them, as in common fractions, the anterior group of teeth being represeuted by the numerator, the posterior group of teeth by the denoioinator.
The abbreviation rec.
is used to indicate recurved teeth, as in Pamphlebia.
To ilhistrate tlie application of the formula, I may refer to fig.
13, PI.
Ill, of Argia h'lpuncbi.hda.
In this species thfre are sixteen folds, eight larger and eight smaller.
The formula would be therefore: 8 (F 12-14, f 1-3), where F represents the larger fields, with teeth varying in number from twelve to fourteen; f, the smaller folds with teeth varying from one to three.
The teeth here are all of approximately the same size.
For Xaidha[/rio)i erythroneurum (fig.
15), where the teeth have a definite arrangement into groups, we must use a more complicated formula.
Here there are sixteen fields, each field showing two distinct groups of teeth.
The anterior groups are represented by the numerators of the fractions, the posterior by the denominators.
The difference in size of the teeth is indicated by the marks ' and ", the former representing the larger teeth, the latter the smaller ones.
The formula therefore is 8 (F ^_~^~, f ^').
The omission of one or more folds from an individual gizzard is not uncommon (see fig.
12), so that often it is only possible to construct a fo)"mula when several specimens of a given species are examined and compared.
The following list of the species of adults whose gizzard-armatures have been studied gives the number of each sex examined, the abdominal segment in which the gizzard was found (and often whether in the anterior or posterior part of the segment), the locality whence the material came and the armature formula: Sub-family CALOPTERYGIN^.

Intra-genePvIC Variations.
By an examination of the structural formulae given above it will be seen that a classification into genera based on resemblances in gizzard structure would agree in most cases with that now in use based upon the structure of wings and other extei-nal features of the body.
If, for instance, we examine the structural formulae for Sapho orichalcea and S. ciliata, we find very little difference between the two species.
In both we see sixteen fields, which in the former are of three sizes, and in the latter of two.
But the number and size of the teeth are approximately equal.
Where a number of species of one genus have been studied, these all, as a rule, show the same number of folds.
Exceptions are seen in the genera Hetcerina and Heterafj rion.
Of five speciea of Hetcerina examined, four show eight folds of the gizzard lining, and one, americana, four folds, although another specimen of the same species (PI.
II, figs.
2 and 3) shows eight folds in both larval and adult gizzard linings; of four species of Heteragrion three have sixteen folds; one, eight.
Even when they vary in the number of folds, species of the same genus are seen to agree almost invariably in the size and number of teeth on each fold, as well as in the arrangement of these.
A marked exception to thi;; was found in the genus Heteragrion.
Of four species of this genus, three had sixteen folds, varying in size, tlie largest folds bearing numerous teeth (above forty;, the smaller ones bearing from five to thirty, while the fourth species had but eight folds, each fold bearing numerous teeth.
Again, of four species of Argia, three are similar, bearing eight " F" folds and eight " f " folds, the teeth on all folds being of equal size.
But in the fourth species, A. agrloides, there are four " F" folds, eight " f " folds, and four "f" folds; on the two lalt.er the teeth are equal in size, but on the four " F " folds they are arranged in two groups, those of the anterior group being similar to the teeth on the other folds, those of the posterior being much smaller and recurved.
Data for Phylogexy.
When the studies whose results are contained in the present paper were begun, it was hoped that they would yield data of value in determining the pbylogeny of the insects investigated.
The data are now at hand, but the desired interpretation is yet to be made.
One may spin several difierent theories on the lines of descent of these Odonata if regard be had merely to the armature of the gizzard.
Bui since these theories would rest on precisely the same evidence in each case, it is wise to refrain from such theorizing until these results can be correlated with others drawn from embryological and comparative anatomical data.
It is worth pointiug out, however, as one present gain to our knowledge which will bear on the question of phylogenies, that the occurrence of numerous minute teeth only is a phenomenon of frequent repetitiou, since it is met with in the genus Hetcerina of the legion Caloptenjx, and in all species of the legions Evphoea and Thore of the Calopterygince, while in the Agrionince it is observed in Jlecistogader and Pseudostigma (legion Pseudostigma) , Philogenia (legion Podagrion), some Disparoneura and Caconeura (legion Proloncura) and all of the legion Lestes.
The problem which this phenomenon suggests is to determine whether it represents a more primitive condition, originally common to all groups to which the genera named belong, or whether it represents independent, parallel and similar modifications in each group from some other and different form of gizzard-armature.
EXPLANATION OF PLATES II, III AND IV.
All the figures are camera lucida drawings, and represent portions of the gizzard linings, spread out flat.
The fraction after each name indicates how much of each lining is shown.
A line indicting a scale length of onetenth millimeter is placed alongside most of the figui'es.

Relationships of the Gtniis Neoheliscus.
— Dr. H. A. Pilsbry, referring to an account of the anatomy of this genus of South American land snails, ^ stated that in commenting upon the peculiarities of the reproductive organs he had overestimated their divergence from structures of African Achatinidw, having overlooked a paper by Arruda Furtado, ^ in which the anatomy of Atopocochlis exaratus is described.
This genus and species, the speaker continued, is confined to the island San Thome, in the Gulf of Guinea; and resembles Neoheliscus in having the retractor muscle of the penis inserted upon the right ocular band (instead of upon the diaphragm, as usual in land snails), and as in Neoheliscus the albumen gland is reduced to very small proportions.
The separation of the male and female ducts clearly indicates that Atopocochlis is viviparous, like Neoheliscus, although no information is given by Furtado upon this point.
The podocyst described in embryos of Neoheliscus is similar to that of Achutitia.
These facts indicate that the South Ameiican genus has its nearest existing allies in West African genera, and accordingly modify the general conclusions set forth in his former paper.
