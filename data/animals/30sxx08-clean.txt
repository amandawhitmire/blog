Mr. Thomas Meeiian ViceI'rosident in tlic cliair.
Twentyseven persons present.
Kneejoint of the Kangaroo.
 Dr. A. J. Pakkek remarked that in studying the anatomy of various animals but little attention has been given to tlie comparative structure of the articulations.
One reason for this is that fulfilling as they do mechanical functions almost similar in different animals their structure varies but little.
In examining the kneejoint of the kangaroo however an arrangement of ligaments was met with so different from what is ordinaril' found in this joint that it deserves some attention.
In man the kneejoint is the most complex of all the articulations and in the kangaroo it is even more complex than in man.
This is in accordance with the increased functional use of tlie joint in this animal.
In making its immense leaps the kneejoint lecomes the centre on which tlie greater part of the strain is exerted and it requires a corresponding strength of structure.
This increase in strength and stability is secured by a peculiar arrangement of the ligaments corresponding to the crucial ligaments of man.
These ligaments are three in number and are arranged in a very interesting and complex manner.
The posterior horn of tlie external semilunar fibrocartilage is free and runs continuously into the fibrous tissue of a crucial ligament which proceeds forwards and inwards and is inserted into the intercondyloid fossa.
The ligament being thus free at its posterior portion would tend to ride upw'ards but this is prevented b' a sta' ligament which runs from about the middle point of this crucial ligament posteriorly and is inserted at the posterior part of the spine of the tibia internally thus keeping it firml in position.
A second crucial ligament arises anteriorly in front of the spine of the tibia proceeds obliquely upwards and backwards and is inserted into the intercondyloid fossa crossing the first ligament obliquely as in man.
It also has a stay ligament running from its middle point backwards and is attached at the posterior internal part of the spine of the tibia at about the same point with the stay ligament running from the first crucial ligament.
It is this arrangement of stay ligaments that gives the joint its complex character and so well fits it to resist strain tending to displace the articular surfaces.
A third ligament arises posteriorly and proceeds upwards and forwards crossing the course of the other two and is also inserted into the inter condioid fossa internally.
Thus there are counting the two stay ligaments five distinct ligaments in the kneejoint of the kangaroo as compared with two as found in man which gives to the joint a Aery interesting and peculiar mechanical structure.
There are no lioamenta alaria or mucosa.

On Polyxenes fasciculatus.
 Mr. J.
A. Ryder announced that he had identified themyriapod Polyxenes faaciculatus.
Say in the vicinity of the city at several places in tlie parlc.
It was found that its morphological history agreed with that of P. lagurus of Europe as detailed by Bode' but there was the same paucity of males as olserved b' that naturalist.
The presence of the hooks terminating the caudal bristles was an independent discovery so far as the American spei'ies was concerned Mr. Ryder not having seen Bode's paper until thiee cUxys after his own observations had been made.
Upon comparing these parts of the two species together we find the ends of tlie bristles according to Bode in the European species bent in the form of a semicircle with the subterminal processes depending parallel to each other from within the arc in our species on the other hand the bristle terminates in two barbed divaricating points directed forwards forming a subacute angle with the supporting shaft of the lristle the subterminal processes depending within the angle on the supporting shaft next the animal.
This new locality indicates a wide distribution for the animal viz. from Georgia where it was first discovered by Say to Massachusetts where it lias been found by Packard.

TRANSITION FORMS IN CRINOIDS AND DESCRIPTION OF FIVE NEW SPECIES.
BY CHARLES WACHS.MUTH AND FRANK Sl'RINiiKK.
The subcarboniferous rocks of the Mississippi Valley have been divided by geologists generally into five divisions or gronps viz. the Kinderhook Burlington Keoknk 8t.
Louis and Chester which occur in the order named  the Kinderhook being the lowest and oldest.
Full accounts of these formations may le found in the Reports of the Geological Surveys of Iowa and Illinois to which we refer for detailed information.
Of these groups the IJurlington and Keokuk limestones extending in vertical range from llie Oolite bed which forms the summit of the Kinderliook into the Gcode bed which apparently forms the boundary letwcen the Keokuk and St. Louis limestones are characterizecl in their fossil remains by a great predominance of crinoids.
They are thereby somewhat conspicuously distinguished from the other members of the subcarboniferous series.
It is to these crinoidal Ix'ds that our observations are at present limited.
Their fossiliferous character is well known and we may add that there is probably no region in the world which exhibits within the same limited geographical extent so great and uninterrupted a range of crinoidal deposits in geological succession almost unaltered In' disturbing forces and which at the same time affords such a variety and abundance of well preserved specimens for accurate comparative stud' as the vicinity of Burlington Iowa and the neighboring exposures of the Keokuk limestone within a few miles to the soutli and southwest.

Dr. C. A.
White gave a very interesting account of the geology of the Burlington region and pointed out the relations as then understood of the formations here exposed with each other and with those occurring in the series above and below.
It was shown that the Burlington limestone consists of two divisions separated from each other by beds of silicious shales chert and cherty limestones of A'arying thickness  that these divisions were characterized by striking differences in their fossil remains that the upper division was succeeded in turn by an accumulation of silicious beds above which appeared the Keokuk limestone differing from the Burlington beds in the specific characters of its fossils as well as in lithological characters  that the three formations presented in their crinoidal remains three successive grades of development those of the lower bed being generally of small size and delicac of construction and ornament those of the upper bed being of stronger construction and ruder form while in the Keokuk the' reach a culmination of rudeness and extravagance of form and size.
He states that few if any species of these fossils are common to both beds of tlie Burlington limestone and that it is hardlj' probable that any will be found common to the Burlington and Keokuk.
The same writer in the Geology of Iowa 1870 vol.
I p. 202 says that the separation of the formations of the subcarbouiferous group from each other is abrupt and distinctly defined  that the interposition of silicious beds constitutes paleontological boundaries between them  and that the change in the lithological character of each deposit toward the close of each epoch seems to have had the effect to check and finally to arrest the progress of those forms of life which previouslj' existed in great profusion  and that with the resumption of calcareous deposits in the succeeding epoch similar if not identical forms were introduced which flourished and progressed until arrested again by similar deposits of silicious strata.
And on page 203 speaking of the two divisions of the Burlington limestone he says   It seems that the accession of silicious material to the waters of that epoch resulted in or at least was followed b the extermination of all the species of crinoids then existing and although they flourished in just as great profusion when the calcareous condition of the waters was restored they were all of newspecies these being all in turn exterminated by the accession of the silicious material which we find to mark the close of the full epoch of the Burlington limestone.
Such may be taken as the prevalent opinion among geologists and paleontologists as to the faunal independence of these three formations although Dr. White does not deem it expedient to recognize hvo distinct formations in the Burlington beds as proposed by Xiles and Wachsmuth in Amer.
Journ.
Science Jnly 1866 and as in practice is done by all the later paleontologists and collectors it being shown by experience that in their organic remains particularly crinoidal the distinction between the two I5iirliniton heels is imicli more sliiirply iiijirkod and clearh' lefined than hetween the upper hed and the Keokuk limestone.
Tlie geologic independence of tiie two latter beds has been scrupulously regarded ly paleontologists and in no ease within our knowledge has a single species of crinoid out of the many hundreds dcscriled been noted as occurring in bolli formations.
Indeed it would seem judging from the descriptions tiiat the increase in new species would serve to confirm their separation.
riit an observer who is familiar with the stratigraphy as well as the fauna of these rocks thrcnighout their whole vertical range obtains an entirel dilierent impression.
Of the man' distinguished paleontologists whose labors have contributed to our knowledge of the fauna of these beds the mnjorit' were not themselves collectors and they were therefore destitute of that personal familiarit' with the mode of occurrence of these fossils which is so iujportant an aid to an accurate understanding of their relations.
The material on which new species have been descriled has often been comparatively limited and specific characters were readily distinguished in a single specimen which could not have been defined in a large series.
There has also been some confusion we believe in regard to the actual horizon of the t3'pes of new species collected by various parties along the border land between the Burlington and Keokuk some localities being referred to the one or tlie other when in fact they belonged exclusively to neither.
Furthermore the two beds being thus for a long period considered as independent it came to be regarded as we have already seen as an inflexible rule that their species must be distinct as was also the case with the Burlington beds.
Accordingl' new forms from the one or the other were brought within the rule and specific distinctions were to some extent assumed to exist because of difference in geological horizon thus illustrating the tendency to reason in a circle into which even the most careful investigators working in a single lino will occasional'
fall.
Ye have been led b' our researches to the conclusion that there is a much more intimate connection between these formations than has been generally supposed and that the assumed extermination of organic forms at the close of each epoch and the appearance in the next of new and distinct forms cannot be reconciled with the facts which have been brought to light.
There is no doubt that the introduction of silicious matter in great abundance into the waters was largely destructive of dftiiioidal life and had also an important influence in producing the changes observed in the crinoids of the successive deposits.
It seems indeed when there was too much of it growth was arrested and life destrojed  but when it existed in the waters in moderate proportion along with calcareous constituents its presence was favorable to existence and individual growth.
It is on the upper surface of cherty layers in the Burlington and Keokuk beds that we find most of the colonies or local deposits of wellpreserved specimens and from the upper beds to and including the Keokuk there is more or less of silicious matter in the matrix and in the fossils themselves.
Tlie strata which compose the beds of passage between the three beds are mostly impure cherty limestone in which the proportions of silicious and calcareous constituents var and it is a fact that throughout these deposits wherever a little bed of limestone appears or the chert becomes rather calcareous in its composition we find the remains of abundant crinoidal life although mostly in imperfect preservation.
It thus seems that notwithstanding the destruction caused by the silicious influx some of the crinoids survived here and there and struggled through until more favorable conditions again prevailed.
In proof of this we have the fact that throughout the cherty deposits between the Upper and Lower Burlington beds we find more or less the remains of crinoids usually in the form of casts and ver imperfect yet sufficiently distinct to be recognized as Actinocrinus Pla'ycrinus etc.
But it is in the beds of passage between the Burlington and Keokuk that we find the most satisfactory evidence of the persistence of crinoidal types and these with the crinoids found therein form the basis of this paper.
The close of the Upper Burlington limestone as heretofore considered was marked bj' an extraordinary destruction of fishes whose remains in the form of teetli and spines are found in the greatest profusion in a stratum two to ten inches in thickness which occurs at the very top of the regular limestone beds.
It is one of the best stratigraphic landmarks that we know in this formation as it is found over a wide area in localities over a hundred miles apart and always in the same position relative to the heavy limestone beds.
It is succeeded immediately bj'x.

This is succeeded by two or three thinner layers of similar texture separated ly silieions shales and yellowish sand and above these occur other irrennlar beds of argillaceous and chert' limestones of A'arying thickness which pass gradually and imperceptibly into the llnishgiay limestones of the Keokuk proper.
These deposits iVoin the first lish bed up to the Keokuk limestone we designate simply to save repeated explanations as the  transition beds.
They are found well exposed near lUirlington and at Augusta and Pleasant Grove Iowa both within twent' miles of Burlington and at Sagetown and Nauvoo Illinois at all of which localities we have carefully studied them.
At Xauvoo they are much thickened and are seen above the town from the water's edge well up into the bluffs which are capped by the Keokuk limestone while in the extensive quarries below the town only the Keokuk limestone has been exposed.
A want of attention to these facts has caused some confusion as to the true horizon of the species described from that locality all being referred to the Keokuk whereas we have found at the upper localit' true Burlington species such as Granatocrinas Soyi and other wellmarked species.
The transition beds are more or less fossiliferous throughout though the occurrence of the fossils is irregular and their ireservation very variable.
They exhibit in an irregular manner the lithologic characters of both formations while the crinoidal remains which have been obtained from them show such an intermingling and blending of the Burlington and Keokuk species that it is impossible to say where the one begins and the other ends.
The majority of the crinoids found in them can neither be called Burlington nor Keokuk species and may often be identified as either.
The constitute a kind of intermediate type between them and throw much light upon the growth of the individual and the development of species in course of time.
Our late investigations confirm the opinion long held b' us that tiie Keokuk limestone and the Upper and Lower Burlington beds are only subdivisions of one geological formation which might appropriately be called the crinoidal limestone.
A considerable nnmber of the fossils under consideration herein were obtained from a single la3'er of limited extent in the fish bed at the top of the Upper Burlington limestone.
They are of comparatively few species and those are extremel' rare in other localities but at this spot they seem to have flourished in extraordinarj' abundance.
These specimens form so important a part of our material tliat to avoid repeated allusions to the locality we refer to them always as the  fishbed fossils.
In the following pages we shall endeavor to illustrate in detail with the excellent material at our command largelcollected with sjjecial reference to this subject the transition between the forms of crinoids in the Upper Burlington and Keokuk beds whicli we believe will possess geological as well as zoological interest.
It is to be regretted that greater attention has not been hitherto paid to tb' Individual growth of crinoids.
We liave made collections expressly' for the purpose of illustrating different stages of development and have found it to be the rule that in young crinoids the basals are the most perfectly developed parts.
They attain nearly their full size in young individuals greater in proportion than the subradials and radials whicli are comparatively early developed and at a time when the interradial and anal plates have scarcely made their appearance.
The latter develop the slowest and in some genera increase continually both in size and number during the growth of the individual.
We also find that abnormal growths or sudden modifications of specific characters almost always take place in the interradial and anal areas the posterior rays and consequently in the dome.
Species have been multiplied by attaching too much importance to characters based on such modifications as the comparative size of the base the number of interradial and anal plates a more or less elongate form etc. which we believe are due in many cases to individual growth and which in species when found in a later geological epoch form mere variations of the same species as will be proved most conclusively by the following genera.

There is a general difference in form and outline between the two species but their chief distinction and the one which produces apparently all the other constant dilierences is that B. jnjriformi has 20 arms one from each opening while B. Ghrislyi has two arms o each arm opening or 40 in all.
This feature of B. ChrUtyi has been for some time known but hitherto the anatomical construction which produces it has not been understood and this we are now enabled to explain.
B. Christyi in its t'pical form has in each ray 3 primary 2 secondary and 2 tertiary radials or radials of the third order or as they are more commonl' designated  brachials.
The latter term is used for that series of radial plates within the liod' walls which leads to an arm opening.
The upper margin of the second or last of these brachial plates is somewhat excavated and in the rear of this cavity the arm opening breaks through.
In very well preserved specimens when the arms have been removed there may be seen upon the floor of this excavated margin a narrow indented scar extending from the arm opening directly outward.
We have found resting upon this scar a very small narrow triangular or pentagonal plate often when the arms are attached not visible from the outside.
This is a rudimentary bifurcating plate and corresponds to a third tertiarradial or brachial plate.
Upon it the arms divide and just at the opening on either side of it is another small short plate upon which the arms partirest the thin small plates filling the excavated upper margin of the last brachial plate.
Referring now to the dome we find the double arm feature most beautifully indicated.
Directly above each arm opening there is a prominent interbrachial dome plate' nearlround or elliptic in outline and from ' For an account of these and other dome plates as well as the construction of the dome of Paleozoic criuoids in general see Amer.

This row of projecting dome plates is a very characteristic feature of this species but is entirely wanting in B. jyyriformis its absence giving to the dome in that species its pyriform aspect and the upward tendencjof the arm openings while in B. Christyi it gives to the arm openings a lateral direction and to the disk its wheellike appearance with its wide leriphery standing about parallel to the vertical axis.
Its peculiar office is well shown in one specimen which has abnormally two extra brachial plates and two arm openings instead of one in part of the ra'.
Here a single interbrachial dome plate is situated between the arm openings instead of one over each and the construction below leaves no doubt that from these two openings single instead of double arms proceeded.
B. Christyi is described as having t anals and 4 interradials in 3 ranges P.h and radials 3X2X2.

The second radial of the third order is long bent upward and about the arm opening constructed exactly as in B. Christyi.
The same interbrachial dome plate is found over each opening very sharp and prominent and although B. trochiscus has never been found with any portion of the arms attached we feel entirely certain that when discovered the' will be found to be double from tlieir origin.

B.
rocliiscioi is Ibnnd only in the transition bed while JJ.
lilaiKxJixriis is said to be from the Keokuk although the type specimen came from Nauvoo and there is the usual uncertainty in reuard to its real horizon.
Now we liave before us about 50 good specimens of I.
Cnislii from tlie Upper Burlington of various localities all of which by their peculiar aspect are readily referred to this siecies.
We find in them a wide variation in form some being tall with dome much elevated and rising uniformlyfrom the margin of the brachial disk to the subcentral proboscis others nearly turbinate below with almost no expansion of the disk and others having a low broad l and rajiidly spreading calyx with concave sides and a nearly flat summit.
The proboscis is in small specimens so far as olserved smooth while in larger ones it is rough nodose and spiniferous the latter being generally the case in those found high uj in the rock.
Between these extremes there is every gradation.
In these specimens we find the following variations in bodystructure Anals 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 21 in 3 4 5 and ranges interradials 2 3 4 5 and fi in 2 3 and 4 ranges with variations of 2 3 and 4 in different parts of the same individual.
The radial series is 3 X 2 X 2 except in one specimen the one with 11 anals which on the inner branch of one posterior ray has an additional bifurcation giving 5 arm openings to that ra or 21 to the specimen one double arm being replaced by two simple ones as in B. planodiscus.
Three others show simple arras from two oienings.
Another specimen with 21 anals has in one branch of a rathe rudimentary bifurcating plate developed into a nearly fullsized bifurcating third brachial.
In ten specimens of B. trochiscus from various localities in the transition bed we find the following variations in structure anals 7 8 12 and 13 in 3 4 5 and 6 ranges  interradials 4 6 7 and S in 3 and 5 ranges  interaxillary pieces intersupraradials to 1 and 2  radials 3X2X2 with occasionally extra brachial bifurcating plates in some of the rays giving in these parts the formula 3X2X3.
In some mature specimens there is in some places a narrow interbrachial plate inserted between the radials of the third order producing an expansion of the disk  and in one of them evidently evy mature the interradial areas are much depressed and the radial series elevated and rounded giving to the calyx as seen from below a tenrayed appearance.
The proboscis in specimens from the transition bed is greatly developed being very long and its plates spiniferous.
We have never seen a specimen of B. planocliscits but from the description and diagram it is evident tuat this species has the same fundamental construction as the two preceding ones.
The only important difference to be found is in the additional bifurcation of the radial series within the body and as a consequence of this structure in the double number of arm openings.
B. Christyi and B. trocliiscus though having 40 arms also have but 20 arm openings and the arms really branch after emerging from the body.
In them the small bifurcating plate which we have described and upon which .he arms divide is evidently a rudimentary free radial and the two plates beside it which in B. Christyi were only arm plates become developed in B. planodiscus into true radials and form a partof the body.
That this is not a mere conjecture on our part is demonstrated by the individual growth of crinoids generallj.
The young Strotocrinus for instance thongh having the same number of arms as the adult has but 4 arm openings to each ray.
The radials of the higher orders which in adult specimens form a part of the hody walls are here still free arms unsupported by any interradial or interaxillarj pieces which subsequently fill the spaces betveen them  but the number of arm openings of the nascent crinoid increases to the full number of arms in proportion to the increase of the upward growth of the body.
This is exactl' the case in B. joJanodiscus and it will thus be seen that B. Christyi and B. frochiscus represent earlier stages of development and that as we have seen before the two later forms differ from the older by those characters which appeared irregularly in B. Christyi and became more fixed and general in the succeeding types.
B. py7iformis whose most important distinction from B. Christyi has been mentioned is described with 7 or 8 anals in 4 ranges  5 or 6 interradials in 3 or 4 ranges  radials 3X2X1 see vol.

It was said to occur in' tlie Upper Burlington.
In upwards of 40 good specimens of B. pyriformif examined we find a great variet' in form.
 In some the bod' expands gradually and uniforml' from the base to the arm bases giving a turbinated outline below while in others it remains of nearly uniform size to the top of the second radials when it suddenl'' and rapid' expands  the radials of the second order and brachials being in a plane nearly at right angles to the vertical axis.
In some specimens twotliirds of the body is below the arm bases and in others scarcely onethird.
In some the brachial disk is continuous in others the interradial areas are somewhat depressed and the body shows a tendency to become lobed.
Between these extremes there is almost every shade of difference.
In the structure of tlie body we find the following variations anals 6 7 8 9 and 11 in 4 and 5 ranges  interradials 3 4 5 6 and 7 in 2 3 4 and 5 ranges with differences in the same individual.
There are no infersupraradials in any of them.
In general the specimens from the upper part of tlie beds are larger more developed proportionally in the dome and exhibit the greatest tendency to become lobed.
The form which Dr. White has described under B. Nashvillae var.
sublractus is found at the very top of the Upper Burlington and also in the transition bed.
It agrees closely with B. piriformis but is always more or less lobed and this is the principal distinction between the two forms.
In 13 specimens all from the above horizon we find the following differences in structure Anals 9 10 and 11 in 4 5 and 6 ranges interradials 5 6 7 8 and 9 in 3 4 and 5 ranges with variations in tlie same individual.
As to tlie intersupraradials upon wliieli White founded liis variety we find in some specimens none and in otiiers one in 1 3 4 and even 5 ra3's respectively while all our Keokuk species of B. Nashvillce proper have an intersupraradial in every ra'.
But the presence and constanc' of those plates is evidentlj a natural consequence of the greater size of the Keokuk form and hence of no specific value.
In B. pyriformis the proboscis is long rather strong with moderately convex plates.
In the B. Nashvillse from transition bedfi the dome is prolonged into a proboscis over five times the height of the caljx the plates of which are convex to slightl' spiniferous.
In the B. Nashvillae of Keokuk the proboscis is similarl elongated but stronger composed of very nodose plates and about niidwa3 to its summit it is encircled by a row of five very strong spines nearly an inch long.
We find that the modifications thus observed in the successive forms of these two t3'pes as thej' appear in the rocks have taken place in exactlthose parts of the crinoid which are changed by growth that the prevailing features of the later species are those which in the Burlington tpes were irregularly developed during the life of the individual  and that theorder in which these modifications appeared corresponds verj' closely with the succession of changes from youth to maturiti.

Y p. 367 placed it under Batocrinus as a subgenus and made interesting observations on the genus and its associate forms.
We have never seen a specimen of Lyon and Casseday 's tj'pical species and are unable to undertake a discussion of these somewhat complicated generic relations.
We are inclined to the opinion however that at present the characters of Batoc7inus and EretmocrimiH are not so clearly defined as could be desired.
Under existing circumstances we prefer to leave Eretmocrinus where its authors placed it.
Among the fishbed fossils some of the most striking exanfples belong to this type.
They exhilnt the peculiar arm structuie in a remarkable degree while they possess a spctial interest in connection with similar forms from other localities.
Tiie specimens here occiining lclonto a single type.
They are cliaracterizecl liy a low lroadly calycnlate body with basal plates in some cases tliickcned into a slight rim at the margin and in others projecting far ont around the cohunn in a tripartitedi.sk.
Tiiree brachial plates in succession rest above the secondary or supia radials with an ext ra set of radials of the third order in part of those rays which have five arms.
Dome much elevated pyriform or hemispheric its plates strongly nodose or subspiniferons.
The surface of the body below the arms is ornamented by rugose ridges which extend along the middle of tlie radial plates and follow the branches to tiie arm bases the latter being separated from each other by indented sutures.
These ridges arc in some specimens low and obscure prominent and angular in others.
The arms are strong rather narrow as if laterally compressed and nearly angular on the outside for about onefourth their length.
They are there ver suddenl flattened spread ont laterally' and become broad and spatulate remaining thick and heavy in the middle and growing thin toward tiie edges.
Their breadtii at the widest point is about half an incii on an average they taper very gradually toward the tips the lengtii being in mature specimens about four inches.
They are composed of a double series of interlocking joints which are verj' short in the lower and longer in the spatulate portion of the arms.
The former are triangular in their transverse section the short base being on the under or ventral side of the arm the longer sides being on the outer or dorsal margin and slightly convex while they join in the middle b'their shorter sides.
The under faces of the joints make oltuse reentering angles with each other in which the ambulacral furrow is situated.
In the flattened portion of the arms the joints have a triangular cross section but the position of the triangles is so changed that the' join in the middle by their bases the shorter sides are on the flat dorsal surface of the arm while the under margins on the ventral side which are slightly concave are the longer sides.
The angles opposite the longer sides are a little greater than right angles so that when closely fitting together by their inner faces the flattened halves or wings of the arms are lifted up at their margins and angidarlv depressed in the middle.
It is a remarkable and interesting fact that the halves of the flatteued arms not oiil' join with each other at the middle b interlocking angles but have similar angles at tiieir thin lateral edges which exactl3' correspond with the angles in the margins of the adjoining arms.
Thus the edges of the arms could be united by closely' fitting sutures into a continuous and impenetrable wall and form an arched dome over the space above the arm bases.
Indeed we always find the arras folded inward at their extremities no matter in what shape the specimens are crushed.
We have from other localities in the Upper Burlington limestone specimens which are perfectly smooth below the arm bases but which in size shape and structure of the arms agree with the fishbed siecimens very closely.
Among a good number of the latter we lind some with 20 arms some with 21 and some with 22 the difference being always in the posterior rays as the others have uniformly 4 arms each.
The variation in the surface markings bears no relation to that in the number of arms for we find the smooth specimens with 20 and 21 arms and the ornamental ones with 20 21 and 22 and we are therefore led to believe that all the specimens under consideration belong to a single species.

7 under tiif name Acfiiiocrinus ramulosus a speelmen wliieli in most respects shows a very near approach to the fishbed forms.
It is referred to the Keokuk limestone but as it came from Nauvoo we are left in douljt as to its actual horizon.
It may have come from the transition beds for we have from eorresjjonding high beds at Augusta Iowa where these beds are extensively exposed a specimen which seems to be almost an exact duplicate of Hall's type as figured.
The ridges are composed of series of prominent tubercles in the centre of each plate in the radial and brachial series and there are also between the ridges much smaller tubercles distributed around the margin of the anal and interradial plates.
It has moreover 5 arms in each posterior raj or 22 in all and we have no doubt but that Hall's specimen would have shown the same number if that portion of the fossil had been preserved.
The arms are unknown.
A comparison of our specimen of A. ramulosus with the fishbed forms of Eretmocrinus shows that they are most intimate'
related.
The only difTerence we can perceive is the rather greater size and more elaborate ornamentation of the A.ramuloaus being difference in degree only and not in kind.
We are thus brought to the conclusion that the type we have described is not specifically distinct from A. ranialoaas which thus includes forms ranging from the Upper Burlington through the transition beds and possibl into the Keokuk.
Those who attach great importance to surface markings or minute anatomical dillorences such as one or two arras more or less would perhaps find in these specimens the types of several species.
But with tlie fossils before us sullicient in number and preservation forlhorough study and comparison and exhibiting the intermingling of characters we have noted we can but regard them as varieties of one and the same specific form which will be of course Eretmocrinus ramulosus Hall sp..
In this type we have again a most interesting illustration of the gradual shading of Burlington into Keokuk forms and the intimate relations of the crinoidal remains of the two formations.

AGAEICOCRINUS Troost.
On bringing together a large number of good specimens of Agaricocrinus from the Upper Burlington transition and Keokuk beds from various localities apparently belonging to several species we found a satisfactory separation into species according to the descriptions imjossible.
We therefore tiiought to ascertain their relations by a comparison of the specimens before us without regard to specific names or geological horizon.
The comparative simplicity of construction and absence of ornamentation in this genus renders such an investigation more easy than in many other groups.
To this end we noted for each specimen separately the characters which in the descriptions have heretofore been considered of specific importance viz. the form of the dome of the basal concavity and of the anal area the shape and position of the second and tliird radial ilates  the form and proportions of the interradials and the character of the interradial area in the dome the number of arms and in addition to these and not heretofore speciallj' noted the disposition of the ajMcal plates of the dome.
Tabulating tliese data independently of the specimens we found that they fell naturally into two groups.
The first of these is characterized by having the apical plates of the dome separated from each other by small intercalated plates the central aiical plate being tuberculiform and very much larger than its associates or any of the dome plates the dome pyramidal anal area flat and the opening lateral three arms to each posterior ray second radial higher than wide first interradial short basal concavity small involving the lower part of the third radial which is convex.
The second group is distinguished by having the apical dome plates connected except at the anal side the central one not greatly conspicuous above the others the dome hemispherical the anal area elevated rounded or protuberant with the opening directed upward the second radials nearly always quadrangulai' and wider than higli.
Within this group are forms with 2 arms to each ray with 3 in one posterior ra with 3 in each posterior ray with 3 in one posterior ray and 4 in the other with 4 in each posterior ray the other rays in all cases save one having 2 with long and narrow first interradials and with short and wide ones with basal concavity very shallow not involving any part of the third radials and deep entirely including them.

'us M. and W. and a new form not heretofore noticed having four arms in eacii posterior ra ' but the combination of these characters was so perplexing that tiie identification of the species was wholly unsatisfactor'.
Upon arranging the specimens however according to the nKJst general modifications such as the greater or less elevation of the anal area and the number of arms we found tiiat they arranged themselves into a series in Avhich while varying irregularly in tiie minor characters observed the forms shaded gradually from one into the others beginning with those having two arms to the ra3' and greatly protruding anal area and ending in those witli four arms to each posterior raj' and ia wide flat anal area.
In these respects the succession was nearh' regulai but no other characters were coincident with them and in other respects there was no nniformit or constanc' whatever.
It was now found that the specimens had also arranged themselves according to their geological horizons beginning with twoarmed forms in the Upper Burlington and extending regularly' tiirough the transition beds with two and three arms to the fouranncd forms in the highest part of the Keokuk.
In this study which we have described thus in detail to show that there is nothing arbitrary or theoretical in the result annfunced we used about thirty wellpreserved siecimens besides the description of the types and we were forced to the conclusion tliat in the second group it is not possible to draw lines which shall separate it into species but that these forms are only A'ariations of a single species of which A. Americaniis is the type and under which A. bulloius A. excavatus and A. nodosus must fall.
A. Worlheni occurs so far as observed onl in the upper part of tlie Keokuk and is very characteristic of it.
We have from the Upper Burlington a single specimen evidently very mature in whifli the apical dome plates are crow'ded apart by small plates and wliich has short interradials but wliich in every other respect agrees with the twoarmed form of A. Americaniis.
We also observed in a verj' large specimen of A.
IFo
 en which is somewhat injured in the rays an arrangement of dome plates which leads us to think it probable that this form will be found with four arms to all the raj's.
The Burlington species of Agaricocrinus are coraparativeh small increasing in size in the upper bed  tlie transition bed fossils are larger still and in the Keokuk there are found tliose ponderous huge forms wliich arc so characteristic of that horizon and of which A. Wortheni is the extreme.
Witli tiiese extraAagant forms the genus becomes extinct and we meet it no more above the Keokuk beds.

ACTINOCRINUS.
The lohed Actinocrinus which Nleek and Worthen considered to be tlie true tj'pe of the genus is numeronsl3' represented in the crinoidal limestones and a large number of species have been described from the Upper Burlington and Keokuk Ijeds.
The tye of the genus is a form subglobose to turbinate below the brachial plane verslightlv convex to pyramidal above the arms the interradial spaces contracted the radial areas prolonged and extended outward about at right angles to tlie vertical axis and formed into lobes which increase in width as they recede from the body thus giving to the fossil when seen from above or below a pentapetalons aspect.
Its leading species in the Upper Burlington leds are A. multiradiatus Shum.
and A. verrucosus Hall both fignred on Phte 10 of the Iowa Geol.
Kept.
The former is characterized by a ver'' low flat dome with the interradial areas greatly constricted and excavated  tiie latter b an elevated dome and a greater development of the interradial dome plates which extend down between the lobes and form a low iim connecting them.
The former has 30 arms the latter 40 the arms of both remaining simple throughout.
In this genus unless the arras tliemselves are preservefl it is very difficult to tell tiieir number for the long projecting lobes are almost alwa's broken away with the arms.
In large collections from tlie Burlington limestone of specimens otherwise well preserved it is exccedingl' rare to find one in which the brachial plates are rcserved to the bases of all the arms.
 They are generally' broken away just above the first bifurcation in the ray and the number of arms appears less than it really is.
This was the case with A. mulliradiafu wliich is rciiresented in the Jowa Rejiort as having two arms to the ray  when in fact it has six as large collections prove.
In tlie Keokuk beds the genus attains its greatest cleveloinient in size and extravagance in features.
It is represented by a huge number of described species of which the leading tyjes are A. Loicei A. pernodo.sus and A. juro.sus Hall and the species of A. Hionholdti and A.
Ajastiizi Troost.
Most of the Keokuk species were apparently described from specimens more or less imperfect in the brachial part of the lobes so that very little reliance can be placed in the arm lurmuhe stated and no iufonnation is giveu in the di'.sciilioiis as to ihe nature of the arms in the different species.
The IJurlington sjjecimens exhibit much variation in iiroortions and orntimentatiou and while they are generalh' of small size and neat sculpturing we find occasionall' a mature individual which with most of the features of its associates is much larger in size and is marked with that roughness of halit and rudeness of form so prevalent in the Keokuk.
The Keokuk species named are all very large uncouth forms with extreme rugosity of surface the latter reaches its extreme in A. Agassizi and A. pernodoHUS while in A. Loivei the contraction of the interradial spaces above the arm bases is so great that almost the entire dome is included in the five lobes.
Specimens from this formation preserving the arms are exceedingly rare and our Keokuk material generally is too limited for a detailed comijarison of forms.
But we have a specimen of the A. verrucosus type apparently A. pernodosus or A. jugosus which shows the arms to be very large and strong and six to the ray  while another which we suppose to be A. Agassizi of Troost's catalogue has apparently 20 arms which are the most ponderous that we have seen in any crinoid.
Two specimens from the Keokuk of Indiana received from Dr. H. S. Harrod of Canton which we consider to be 3'oung and old individuals of A. Loivei have eight primary arms on the posterior rays and six in the others they possess the very peculiar feature not hitherto noticed that the inner arms of each ra' instead of being simple throughout bifurcate about midway giving 10 and 12 arms to the ray at the extremities.
In the transition beds there occur certain forms represented by many specimens in which the characteristic features of the Burlington and Keokuk species are united.
The' shade into A. viuUiradiatus on the one hand and into A. Lowei on the other by such easy gradations that specific distinctions are impossible.
It is probable that A. brontes and A. unicarinatus Hall which were described from Nauvoo and wliich we were unable to identify never seeing an authentic specimen belong to these same intermediate forms.
Among specimens from the transition beds we have found one in wliich as if foreshadowing the peculiar arm features of A. Loivei some of the arms were .nmple tchile others divide an inch above their bases into two branches.
This type also having reached its culmination in the Keokuk beds becomes here extinct.

Mr. F. B. Meek in Hayden's Reps. U.S. Geol.
Surv.
of tlie Territories for 1871 p. 373 proposed the name Eudadocrinus as a subgenus for the reception of a type of Plattcrinus in which the radial series are extended into long free tubes bearing the true arms along their sides.
Some lately acquired material from the crinoidal beds and especially the fish bed enables us to add something to pi'esent knowledge of this Ibrin.
The type under consideration has exact'
the bod' structure of Pla ycrinua up to the third radials.
It inchules both the low broad cupshaped and tlie elongate form of calyx.
But instead of giving off the arms in clusters from the third radial as usual in Platycrinits it has the radial series of the body both dorsal and ventral enormously extended in the form of tuJDular free rays from which the arms spring alternatel' on eitlier side throughout their length.
It bears the same relations to the typical PlatycrinuM tliat the form described as Steganocrinus by M. and W. in vol.

Geol.
Kept p. 195 does to the typical Actinocrinus it being sometimes impossible witli our present knowledge to determine to which genus the specimen belongs when the arms are removed.'
The value of these differences in arm arrangement as to generic relations is as yet an open question but we have found that the structural difference between the two forms is not by anv means so great as first impressions would indicate.
Tiie free rays of Steganocrinus are actually nothing but extreme developments of the lobes of Aclinocrinus multiradiatus or A. Loivei and in like 1 A similar variation in the arras is observed in Hevacrinus those of H. brevis Goldfuss being similar in type to the earlier forms of Platycrinus while H. limbaius Miiller has arms of difiFereut type somewhat like Eudadocrinus but more like Barycrinus.

p. 542 sccras at a casual glance to have a somewhat similar arrangement of the arms.
But bis descriptiou was undoubtedly made from a young specimen and a comparison of a large number of very young specimens of Platicrinus in some of wUich the arms are onlj' sprouting as it were shows that the arrangement seen in his diagram is that of the nascent Platycrimis generally and that the little side appendages are pinnules and not arms.
The arm joints in the young of this genus are mostly single the tips only being formed of a double series of interlocking joints which in the adult prevail down to the bifurcation of the arms.
Eucladocrinus millebrachiatus n. pp.
Column very large and long twisted composed of joints which increase in thickness as the' recede from the bod'.
Tlie faces of the joints are eccentric elliptic the rim beveled to an edge sometimes sharp and sometimes obtuse from which project rather irregularly small toothlike spines Each joint is twisted so tiiat the long axes of the reverse faces make a considerable angle with each other while the articulation on tiie long diameters imparts a rapid twist to the whole stem and permits motion in all directions.
The articulating processes run lengthwise of the face of the joint and consist of a strong ridge along the middle with anotlier on either side near the peripher and curving like it.
There are deep depressions on either side of the median elevation probably filled by interarticulary suljstance.
Perforation of the column round and extiemely minute barely large enough for the insertion of a fine needle pfint.
Body exclusive of free rays of medium to large size cupshaped to elongate hemispheric.
Basal and first radial plates thin basal disk low about onethird the height of the bod3 Facet for attachment of the column slightly indented and surrounded by a low lamellose ridge or by a row of small tubercles.
Surface of basal plates marked by rows of small nodes and rugose ridges arranged parallel to the margins and radiating to the angles the same ornamentation extending upward on the first radials.
Edges of basals obtusely bevelled.
There is considerable diversity in the surface sculpturing it being olscure on small specimens conspicuous on large individuals.
First radials higher than wide their sides about 2arallel margins not bevelled but forming close sutures with adjacent plates gibbous in the middle and swelling toward the margin of the second radials.
Articulating facet large broad semicircular occupying onethird to onehalf the height and onehalf to one third the width of the plate facing outward nearly parallel to the vertical axis.
Anal plate about equal in size to the interradials inflated above and forming a part of the flattened dome.
The anal opening situated at its ujper margin.
Beyond the first radials the rays extend out horizontally both on the dorsal and ventral side and are produced into long free tubular armlike appendages which are really extensions of the body in the radial series.
They bifurcate on the second raflial into two branches which do not immediately diverge but remain united hy their inner sides as far as tlie middle of tlie third ridial plate lcyoiid which they heeoiue free and continue so to their extremities.
1 fence tiierc are two free branches to each ray or ten in all eaeli of which hears the true arms on eitiier side in alternate succession.
The lranfhes are of about uniform size for half Iheir length after which they lajjer gradually ami aiiparently terminate in a true arm.
A tulular passaffe arched over by the extensions of the dome runs the entire length of the free rays.
Tlie tubes of tlie two brandies alier uniling on the insiile of the second radial connect with the central visceral cavity.
Second radials very short broad and deep fdling the entire surface of the articidating scar rounded below curved at the sides to meet the dome plates their transverse outline about semicircular dorsal aspect obtusely pentagonal though actually heptagonal.
The lateral extremities of this plate like those of the succeeding radials have angular faces interlocking with corresponding faces of small plates which fill the interbrachial areas on tiie ventral side ol the rays.
The upper equal faces of the plate slope at a ver3' obtuse angle and bear two plates in siiccession wdiich are radials of the second order.
The first of these is short hexagonal its long margins about parallel its outer lateral margin notched by a small channel which penetrates through the plate to the tubular cavit' within.
The inner lateral margins of this and the next interlock with those of corresponding plates in the other branch of the ray the salient angles of one meeting the sutures of the other.
The second radial of this order is almost quadrangular though actually pentangular much narrow'cr than the adjoining ones and sustains on its outer sloping face the base of an arm.
It is slightly wedgeform its greater height being on the inner margin and this causes the division of the ray which takes place near the top of this plate.
The plates throughout the entire length of the free rays form an indefinite number of successive orders of radials of two each the second of which is a cuneiform bifurcating plate sustaining on its longer upper face the ilates of the next order of radials and on its very short outer sloiting face in connection with the still shorter outer face of the first plate of the next series the brachial pieces which form the beginning of the arms.
The brachial pieces or first pair of armjoints are rather deepl' set into the raj and while thej rest chiefly upon the cuneate second radial of each series and tlie outer face of the succeeding plate they also abut against the plate aljove and below.
In one very large specimen in part of the ray near the body they are imbedded still deeper so that they touch five plates of the ray as is the case in E.pleurovimeniis but at a greater distance from thebody they abut only against four as is the general rule.
The arras are long rather strong gently tapering directed along the raj's toward the extremities composed of a double series of rather short interlocking plates every alternate one on either side giving rise to a long slender singlejointed pinnule.
The arms are given off from each pair of plates in the free ra3's alternately on each side thus giving an arm for every two plates throughout their length.
In one of our specimens of medium size there are about .30 arms to one branch lut the extreniit' is not preserved and we have reason to thinlv they averaged 10 more wiiich would give 80 to the ia3'or 400 in all.
In some of the larger specimens the number was doubtless much greater and probably in some cases approached 500.
Dome flat composed of comparativelj' large plates the apical and radial dome plates being at tlieir middle part abruptly elevated into papillate nodes with a roughened or wrinkled surface.
Tlie plates of the interradial areas of which there are but few are smooth.
At the place where the rays emerge from the inner body directly over the second primary radial there is a large dome plate marking the incipient bifurcation of the ray with several small ones below succeeded by two rows of very large extremely prominent plates like those of the dome but much more conspicuous and with coarser surface markings.
The latter are placed along the ventral side of the raj' and alternately' on either side so that one plate is alwaj's situated over the base of an arm and by counting them the number of arms can be determined as readily' as from the radial plates on the dorsal side.
Tlie spaces between these brachial dome plates are occupied b' smaller flat rounded or subspiniferous plates irregularly arranged.
The arrangement of the vault pieces of the rays is such that they could not have opened and hence the passage within was always tubular and never an open canal.
The radial appendages have a tendency to bend downward leaving the ventral surface exposed.
We have noted the presence of a small channel at the lateral extremity of the first radial of the second order and will now add tliat this forms the passage of a goodsized pore.
Similar pores pierced tli rough at tlie cr'.
of the plate and iiielosed Ijy the almttiiig mnrgiii of an aljaceiit plate are found on car.U side of the free rays near the base of every arm.
They communicate with the tnhnlar passage and have aljout the same direction as the arm furrows One pore penetrates every first brachial piece on each side of the armla8e another enters at the outer lateral edge of the first radial of each order a third one occurs at the edge of the second radials  hut toward liie upper or thinner part of the rays we found oidy two pores between eacli pair of anus in phice of three as described.'
' Tin' presence of the pores in tlie sides of the radial appendages is such a notable feature in tlie form nnder consideration that interest is naturally awakened as to their jirobable functions and this the more since similar pores have been observed by us in several othisr genera.
Thej are very conspicuous in Baiocriaus where they are arranged in ten pairs five radial and five interradial each pair is situated between the adjacent arms and they connect through the body walls with the inner cavity.
They are found also in Ae'iiiocHnun and Strotocrinus in the free arm bearing rays of Sieganocriims within the false arms of Ollacrinus and pores are found in the ventral sac or socalled inflated proboscis of some of the CyathocrinidcB.
If now we compare the position of these openings with the socalled ovarian openings of tlie Blastoids and the pectinated rhombs of tlie C3'stidians Avhicli are considered by some authors to be ovarian by others respinitory organs tlie question is forcibly suggested whether these may not have had the same functions perhaps serving as a madrepoiic apparatus for the introduction of water to the body.
Such organ has never been noted in Faleocrinoids and yet must have existed in them somewhere.
In some genera the pores in the body Avails Avere evidently absent ut we have observed in this connection that in tliose genera the column is not only very large but the tubular cavity within is of extreme size and follows Avith its ramifications the numerous branches and roots into which those columns divide.
Their cavity is peculiarly constructed generally pentapetalous in form and its inner Avails throughout built up of thin laminated plates Avith innumerable slits punctures pores grooves ridges and other processes through which a communication with the surrounding Avater Avas easily effected.
Such complicated structure shoAvs that the column must have performed a vastly more important office in the animal economy than that of an attachment to the sea bottom and may have had here the additional functions of those of the pores especiallj' as Ave find that in every genus in Avhich pores have been observed in the body AA'alls tlie perforation in the column is veiy small and shows no signs of a structure as above described.
We call attention to tliese facts at present in the hope that they may lead to observations on the subject elsewhere and Ave hope hereafter to eive it a more detailed iuvestisation.
In the investigation of this species we have made use of a magnificent series of specimens from the fish bed found within a few feet of each other.
Tliere are nine individuals in good preservation presenting to view almost every aspect of the fossil they represent difl'erent stages of growtli and show tlie gradations from small to large individuals.
We have also before us a specimen from the division bed at Nanvoo and tliree from the Keoiiuk limestone.
The latter are considerably larger than the fishbed specimens but exhibit otherwise in the parts preserved no essential difterence.
Only a portion of the rays is preserved on one of the Keokuk specimens but sufficient to show that it had the same arm structure.
Until discovery of more perfect specimens shall prove tiie existence of more important differences than yet observed we can only regard the Keokuk form as belonging to the same species with the tendency to variation generally observed in Keokuk representations of Burlington tj'pes.
This species is distinguished from E. pleurovimenus by the low discoid calyx the flat concave base the massive body plates the deep sutures the more robust and rapidly tapering radial appendages of that species.
In four specimens we find that the free rays are always folded inward upon the ventral side instead of hanging down as in our species.
It has about the same number of arms as ours and either of them with their ten long rays fully extended and the hundreds of arms stretching outward must have presented a very striking appearance.

Column large twisted and constructed as in E. millehrachiatus.
Body rather large low broadly cupshaped or discoid.
Basal and radial plates heav'  basal disk deeply and abruptl3' excavated below so that four or five joints of the column are inside the plane of its outer rim.
Basal plates elevated near their margins into a thickened rugose rim which is also found near the lower margin of the first radials.
All the plates are broadly and deeply bevelled on their margins.
First radials onehalf wider than high their lower projecting margins overhanging below the plane of the base so that the body rests on these margins wlien 17 placed upon a Icvrl siirface.
Articulating facet prominent much elevated by the thickening of the plate hroad semicircular oc'cup3'ing about onethird the width and height of the first radial its surface about paralkd witli the plane of tlie ilate which makes an angle of about 4 with the vertical axis.
Anal plate a little larger than the intcrradials supporting on its upper face a series of small dome plates above whicli is the anal aperture situated very low and opening laterally.
I'ht' radial areas are produced into free appendages approaching the structure of EncladocrinHs.
They are large strong anl broadly rounded below spreading out about horizontally and folding upward on the ventral side.
They bifurcate on the second radial but remain joined by their inner sides to the top of the second plate above it where they diverge and become free.
The branches diminish in size very rapidly giving off arms alternately on either side to about the twelfth plate where each terminates in a bifurcating plate from whose equal upper faces two true arms diverge.
The surface of the plates is irregularl' elevated and rounded and the sutures are slightly sinuous giving to the rays a wrinkled or corrugated appearance.
Second radial short broad filling the articulating faces pentagonal in outline bearing upon its upper obtuselysloping faces the radials of the second order two in succession whose inner edges join but do not interlock the sutures in the two series coinciding.
The first radial of the second order is about quadrangular its upper and lower margins flexuous.
The second is much narrower and is a bifurcating plate whose longer upper face bears the radials of the next order while its short acutelysloping outer lateral face sustains the lower margin of the first and largest brachial piece.
The second radial of the next order gives rise to an arm on the opposite side and so on alternately to the end of the ray.
There are about six pairs of radials of as many orders each of which represents an arm and the last pair two arms thus giving off normally seven arms to each branch fourteen to the ray and seventy in all.
The first pair of brachial pieces are large of unequal size and imbedded in the ray so that they abut against four of the radial plates.
Arms comparatively long and heavy composed of a double series of interlocking plates with a furrow on the ventral side connecting with the tubular cavity of the ray.
and apparentlybearing pinnules in the usual waj.
Dome elevaterl hemispheric composed of large tumid plates of which the apical and interradial ones are the most prominent the radial area in the vault being composed of a double series of smaller plates which extend out along the ventral side of the I'ays as continuations of the dome.
This species in its body structure is most closeh' related to E. pleu7'ovimenus.
having a similar low discoid form and heavy plates but it can be easily distinguished by the extremely deep excavation of the lase below the prominent ridges at the margins of the basal and first radial plates the extreme depth and width of the bevelings at the sutures the elevation of the articulating faces and b'the very distinct arm structure.
It resembles P. tuherosus Hall in its discoid dorsal cup but in that species the calyx is much lower the armbases being in the plane of the base.
The deep and acute beveling of the margins of the plates in our species gives it a sharp angular appearance not visible in any other species.

Platycrinus prsenuntius as stated before represents the transition form between the typical Platycrinus and Eucladocriius the latter being the extreme wing of the genus.
A comparison of the species of Platycrinus occurring in the Upper and Lower Burlington beds gives further interesting results concerning the history of the genus.
In all the species from the Lower bed the arms both of the discoid and of the elongate form divide upon a triangular or pentangular bifurcating plate having equal sloping faces and the two halves of the rays are free above the second radial or become so at the first radial of the second order  while in almost every species from the Upper bed the arms branch oft' alternately from the smaller sloping face of a more or less cuneate plate similar to P. prsenuntius  and while we find on the former not over four arms to each half ray with abnormally a fifth one there are species in the Upper bed with seven eight and nine aruis to each half or eighteen to the ray.
There are before us some most interesting specimens of a form from that horizon perhaps of P. Halli Shum. but more probably at least if Meek and Worthen's identification of that species in vpl.

Rep. p. 454 is correct of an undescribed type which in the form of the body and the goiicial plan of its radial construction is so intiluateh' related to our E. mitlibrachiatus as P. prienunlius to E. 2jleu7'ooiineniis that one is forcibly struck with the idea that the former may Ossilly represent a 3'ounger stage of the latter.
That this however is not the fact is proved be3ond doubt b' a number of sieciraens of each species and of dilfercnt size which show the greatest constancy in their respective characters  and as the two forms occur in a distinct horizon we are compelled to regard it as not individual growth but as a more mature development of the genus.

ICHTHYOCRINUS Conrad.
In investigating some specimens apparently of this genus of a new form and unusual size from the fish bed we encountered much difficulty in determining their generic relations and were accordingl' led to an examination of the entire literature of this and Its allied genera Taxoc7'inus Rud Forbciocrinus.
Meek and Worthen in vol.
II 111.
Geol.
Rep. p. 269 have discussed the relations of the two lastnamed genera and have furnished good reasons for considering Forbesiocrinus to be only a subgenus of Taxocrinus.
The generic formula which includes both is shown to be 3 basals Avhich are sometimes rudimentary 5 subradials and 3 or 4 X 5 radials.
It thus appears that the only difi'erence between the two forms is in the interradial and anal areas Taxocrinus being either without plates in these spaces or having but 1 to 3 and Forbesiocrinus having from 7 to 30 or more.
Taxocrinus ranges from the Upper Silurian up Avliile Fo7besioc7inus is maini' confined to the Subcarboniferous.
The genus Ichlhyocrinus was established by Conrad in 1842 without generic diagnosis.

p. 557 describes the genus as having a round smooth and slender column 5 basal plates 3x5 radials the basals being small and there being sometimes three other rudimentary plates within the 5 basals.
Five American species are known of which Hall described .

I. subangulalus.
and I. tiaraeformis Troost and Winchell and Marcy I. corbis.
Of these I. tiarseformis is said to have 4 radials in the anterior ry.

Burlingtonensis before us distinctly show the presence of 3 rudimentary basals mentioned by Hall as pi'olably of generic importance and this would make the formula  basals 3  subradials 5  radials.
3x5 thus agreeing precisely with Taxocrinus and Forbesiocriiius except in the absence of anals and interradials.
The discovery of our new species I. nohilis brings fresh confusion to the subject and obliterates at once this apparently satisfactory distinction.
In this species in 3'oung and mature individuals we have 1 to 3 to 5 interradials 1 to 2 interaxillar' plates and 3 to 4 mostl' 4 priraar' radials with a wide variation in the radials of the second and third orders sometimes in the same individual.
On the other hand.
Hall describes in the Journ Bost.
Soc.
Xat.
Hist.
1861 p. 261 under Forbesiocrinus Thiemei another Burlington form of which the typical specimen without doubt adult had neither anal nor interradial plates.
Thus showing in a most satisfactorj' manner tliat the interradials may be present or absent in either tjpe.
In Hall's species the radials are 3 X 5 which increase in size upward the second order of radials and sometimes partly the third order leaning against those of the adjacent rays.
This species agrees up to the top of the secondary radials most remarkably with Ichthyocrinus and onljdiffers in the upper series of radials or free arms which are rounded on the back in place of being flat as in that genus.
That we have since found other specimens with to 1 and 3 interradials in one or more areas and even 5 or more in its representative from the Upper Burlington bed cannot diminish the weight of our argument  it rather serves to prove more conclusively that the presence or absence of these plates is of but little value even as a specific character.
Hence there remains no distinction as to the bodstructure between the three genera.
The Burlington forms of Ichthyocrinus are readily recognized by the level plates and uniform curvature of the body the disposition of the arms which rest closely against each other and infold at their tips the waving sutures and rapidly increasing width of the primary and secondary radials.
In I. laevis Hall the plates are obtusely' angulated and in I. subangulatus the surface of tiie radials is elevated in the centre and in .
corbis the margins of the radials are straight while Forbesiocrinus and Taxocrinus have undulating sutures to a greater or less extent.
Thus the only constant character is tilt' closely joining and iiifoldini arms of Ichtlnjocrinas.
Under this state of facts it seems clearly impossilile to lonjer maintain generic distinctions between the three forms.
As Icdhijocrinus is the oldest name it mnst take precedence and Taxoarinus and Foi'besiucrinns be considered at the most as subgenera under it.
Hut wliether even this separation can be upheld seems to us doubtful.
That in Ichthyocrinus the arms join and infold that the basals are rudimentar' only visible from the inside that in Taxocixand Forbcsiocrinus those plates are more developed appearing externally are no bona fide features upon which to found subgenera and yet they seem with our present knoledge to be the onl' constant characters for separation  in all others we find such an easy gradation from one species to another such an intermingling of characters among the three t3qes that it apiears almost impossille to draw a line where the one genus shall begin and the other end.
Ichthyocrinus nobilis n. sp.
.
Column round comparatively small and with small spin' processes in the periphery of every alternate joint.
Central perforation moderately large with pentapetalous section.
Calyx large forming with the closely folded arms a smooth subglobose or ovoid body.
Basals not visible the five subradials seen only at the angles.
Primary radials four to the ray two and a half times as wide as high  widest at the upper margin.
In large individuals lcy increase rather slowly in width to the fourth plate the rays being separated blarge interradial spaces but in smaller specimens with onljfew interradials the increase is very rapid.
Secondary radials 3 to 4 var'ing more or less in the same individual the largest having 4 in 9 branches and 3 in the other branch one specimen of medium size has 4 in 7 branches and 3 in 3  a young example has 3 in 5 branches 4 in 2 and the others not visible.
Those plates increase in width very rapidl' the uper ones being 4 to 5 times as wide as high so that above the interradial spaces the sides of the ras join again.
In the next or third order of radials tliere is variation of 3 5 8 and 9 plates in the ramifications in the same individual.
In all our specimens there is at least one more bifurcation beyond this apparently throughout the rays giving at least 40 arms but in the largest individual there is still another on the outer tertiary ramifications of each half of the ray while the inner ones remain simple thus giving 12 arms to each full ra' or fiO in all.
All tlie radial and arm plates have a very irregular outline the bifurcating plates being pentangular the others more or less quadrangular with additional small angular faces.
The upper and lower margins of the plates are strongly undulated and deeply depressed in the middle somewhat as in Fo7besioa7'iuusSini showing in the second series of radials ver' obscure patelloid plates.
The undulating feature extends even to many of the lateral margins the tendency throughout the wMiole body being to curved lines.
The surface of all the plates is smooth and level with the others except the gentle curvature which accommodates them to the general sphericity of the body  that is to say the surface of tlio bod' is uninterrupted by an' elevations or surface angularity of the plates.
The arms are flat comparatively Itroad and lie close together touching at their sides the lines of junction being straight.
The plates both of arms and body are very thick and heav those of the arms have on their inner or ventral side a deep furrow with another smaller and shallower groove on either side.
Between the rays there is a set of interradials extending upward in a wedgelike arrangement from a little above the level of the primar' radials filling a considerable space.
There are in full grown specimens from 3 to 5 interradials of rather large size but we find in one apparently very young individual onl' a single plate and only one interradial space.
Between the first branches of the rays there are 1 to 2 interaxillary plates which are naiTow and elongate.
These plates as a transverse section of one of the rays shovvs are cuneate or pyramidal their apices directed outward and wedged be' tween the radials  and in this case the interaxillar' though large and massive had not penetrated through the wall none being visilile from the outside.
This species is readily distinguished from all described forms of the type b' its 4 primary radials and its interradial plates.
From Taxocrinus and Forheaiocrinus it differs in its subglobose form uniform surface the flatness and close infolding of the arms.

Tills genus is remarkable for the persisteiiee which some of its forms maintain throughout the crinoidul formations.
A careful examination of the prevalent Burlington forms both from description and numerous specimens which we were induced to make in connection Avith some uiiiiiie forms from the fisli bed gave interesting results.
The common species described and most numerously represented in all the collections that have ever been made at Burlington are 6'.
loioensis 0. and Sh. G. dioaricatus and C. malvaceus Hall always considered lower led species and C. viminalis Hall from the upper bed.
The identification of these species in large collections has always been attended with difficult' excejt those specimens of this type found in the uiper bed which were promptly referred to C. viminalis it being taken for granted in pursuance of common understanding which had acquired the force of law that the same species could not be found in both beds.
If the descritions of these four species be considered together it will be found that but one species is represented with slight variations in the form and proportions of tlie plates.
According to the description the' all have small subglobose bodies with basal plates minute to moderately large  subradlals proportionall' large equilateral to wider than high and obtusely angular to tumid and gibbous  radials about equal to or smaller than the subradials  articulating scar impressed small to moderately large arms divaricating to strongly diverging surface granulose to granulosestriate.
An examination of over a hundred specimens of this type most of them having the arms preserved has disclosed such a promiscuous combination of all these characters as to render specific separations entirely' out of the question and has satisfied us that the differences noticed in describing isolated specimens are individual and the result of different stages of growth of the one species G. lowensis.
The type of G. divaricatus was no doubt the jounger stage in which the basal portions were most prominent and C. malvaceus a mature individual in which the greater development of the subradials left the basals proportionally small.
Between supposed typical specimens of C. lowenais from the lower bed and of C. viminalis no difference can be pointed out in the body and the only character which we can discover to mark the forms from the two leds is that in the Upper bed specimens the arms generally taper slightl more than in those from the Lower bed.
The sirailaritj indeed identity in all otlier respects is so striking that we see no other course than to consider them all as one and the same species which would fall under the older name G. lowensis.
We have been forced to this conclusion onl' after the most faithful investigation of the abundant material at our command and in which the collections from the different horizons are authentic.
But our difficulties do not end here.
We find this same form occurring not unfrequently in the typical Keokuk localities and indicating not only a striking persistence of type throughout the whole crinoidal formation but similarity of specific characters quite remarkable.
It is described by Prof. Hall as C. parvibrachiatus and in the specific characters named hy him it agrees with the Burlington type in every respect except the more rapidly diminishing size of the arms.
Numerous specimens from various localities show that this feature is quite variable and one series of 18 individuals from near Bonaparte Iowa collected there in a thin layer not over two feet square and preserving the arms shows the same intermingling of minor characters and variet' of size as is found in the Burlington forms.
One of these specimens placed beside a similar individual from tlie Lower Burlington presents to the ej'e scarcely appoint of difference.
On an average however we find the Keokuk specimens to be a little larger their arms stronger in the lower parts and more rapidl' taering than in those from Burlington and hence we do not feel at present authorized nor do we wish to do so when it can possiblj' be avoided to interfere with the specific name.
Some other species of Cyathocrinus in the Keokuk limestone tend toward more robust forms and heavier arms and among the fishbed fossils we have discovered several forms departing from the characteristic types in the same direction of which we describe two new species.
Cyathocrinus barydactylus n. sp.
Column Qvy large larger than in anknown species of the genus its projecting joints more or less serrated central perforation of moderate size and obscurely pentapetalous.
Bod' of medium size bellshaped turbinate below abruptly spreading in the first radials greatly constricted at the dome.
Diameter at arm bases about equal to height though less in smaller specimens.

Subratliais hirufc iiiihcr tiiaii wide four Ijexagoual and one heptagonal.
their surfaces sligiitly convex.
First radials alout as wide as high great' thickened toward the inaigin oC liic articulating facet and their upper margins very strongly incurved so that the diameter of the dome is about equal to that of the internal cavity at the middle of the subradials.
Anal plate about onefourth the size of the first radials higher than wide and supporting the plates of a lateral upright proboscis.
IJody plates thick and heav' especially the first radials marked by a coarse irregular rugose ornamentation which is least observed in the first radials.
The sutures are rather deeply marked.
Articulating facet flat to slightly concave much elevated facing outward about parallel witli the vertical axis and occuping about twothirds the area of the plate.
Its outline is elliptic notched on the ventral side by the arm furrow.
Succeeding radials free lroadly and deeply rounded twothirds as wide as the first radials forming very strong rays of nearly uniform diameter one bifurcating on the fourth free radial and two on the second the others not being seen exhibiting in this respect an irregularity common to the genus.
The plates below the bifurcation are quadrangular as viewed from the outside and of about equal size lacing a little over half as long as the first radials.
The bifurcating plates are pentangular the upper margins being equal and nearly at right angles sustaining two equal branches of half the size of the free radials.
These bifurcate again on the second or third plate and there are two or more bifurcations above apparently all from the second or third plate.
The most remarkable feature of the species is the rapid diminution of tiie size of the arms which are comparatively shorter than in any other known species of this genus.
The' are composed of single joints constricted in the middle expanding at their upper margins and are without pinnules.
The form and size of the free rays and the sudden shrinking in the arms gives to the form an entirely unique appearance not unlike that of Onychocrinus and the height from the base to the top of the primary radials is more than half that of the entire fossil excluding the column.
The arms are provided at their ventral side with a comparatively small though deep furrow of tripartite form which extends throughout the arms.
The contraction of the body at the summit is very similar to that in Poteriocrinua 
geometricus.

The thickness of the first and the succeeding radial plates in this and the succeeding species might suggest a reference to Barycrinus but the arm structure and column at once proves it to be Cyathocrinus.
This species differs so entirely from all other described Burlington forms that comparison is unnecessary and the only species occurring elsewhere to our knowledge which at all approach it are from the Keokuk limestone  as for instance G. multibrachiatus from Crawfordsville Ind. which has also a turbinate body but is otherwise quite distinct.

Cyathocrinus Gilesii n. sp.
Column comparatively small projecting joints rounded on the edges central perforation small obscurely pentapetalous Body depressed cupshaped twothirds as high as wide though a little more elongate in .young specimens slightly expanded at the middle of first radials and so deeply and abruptly constricted at the dome that the diameter at the upper margin of the plates in mature specimens is about the same as that at the outer angle of the basal plates thus making the internal cavity nearly spherical.
Basals comparative'
small about onehalf their size exposed beyond the column forming a nearly flat disk with the points of the plates inflected upwai'd at a sligiit angle with the plane of the base.
In 3'oung specimens these plates are more prominent and bend upward at a greater angle.
Subradials large about as wide as high and of the usual form stronglj convex to tumid.
First radials very large more than half the height of the calyx elevated around the margins of the facet and their upper margins abruptly and deeply incurved.
There is only one anal plate in line with the first radials and it is of about onefourth their size the succeeding plates form a part of the proboscis which is placed laterally with an upward direction.
Body plates comparatiyelj'' thin excavated in the inside.
Surface destitute of ornamentation.
Articulating facet niodorately clevaterl flat to concave and about parallel to the vertical axis its outline circular and notched by the arm furrow.
Succeeding radials form free rays wjiich are cylindrical thick and strong the plates having the same transverse outline as the facet.
The fiee radials are irregular in number and like the arm plates constricted in the middle as in ij.
ba7'ijdachjlus with the exception that in our present species the second radial is much shorter.
Sometimes especiall3' when the facet is quite concave the latter plate is wedgeform with its thin edge directed outward so that the plate itself is only visible near the ventral side of the ra.
The arm furrows converge at the centre of the dome.
Five rather prominent so called consolidating plates of deltoid form ilaced at the sutures and resting in the thin incurved margin of two adjoining first radial plates connect with each other by lateral extensions beneath the furrow leaving an opening in the centre.
Both central opening and furrows were undoubtedly covered with small plates which have not been preserved in our specimens but Ave found one in which a part of the arm furrow is covered by interlocking plates similar to the arm covering of C. lowen.sis described bC. Wachsmuth Am.

This species has some features in common with the preceding one and had we but a single specimen we might well consider it an abnormal variation from that type.
But having before us several specimens of each form of various sizes we find its leading characters so constant that we are compelled to regard it as distinct.
The size of the column the form and size of the basals the tumid subradials the low cupshaped bod' the thinner plates and the short second radials are features b which it can be readilyidentified.
It bears some resemblance to C.rotundafus Hall of the Burlington and C .
parvibrachiatua Hall of the Keokuk bed but is distinct from both in the size and shape of the first and of the free radials while it differs like C harydactylus from all other known species in its proportions half the entire height of the fossil above the column being embraced between the base and the first bifurcation.

Meek and Worthen in vol.
II 111.
Geol.
Report p. 21Y have given a very full review of the literature of the subject together with an able discussion of the characters of this interesting genus which have been in some respects entirely misunderstood b earlier writers.
The true nature of the foramina in the upper part of the radial series was shown to be that of arm openings  while the interradial appendages which Aveie described as arms by Hall and others were demonstrated to be not arms but entirel independent organs supposed to be connected with reproduction or respiration.
To their very instructive observations to whicli we refer as the basis of our remarks we are enabled by the possession of more perfect material to add some interesting facts.
With Meek and Worthen we cannot agree however in regard to the nomenclature of the genus.
Cumberland in 1826 proposed the name Ollacrinus for this type and gave very good figures by which it may be recognized with much greater facilitj indeed than by Phillips's generic diagnosis and descriptions.
According to the rules of the British Association Cumberland's name is without doubt entitled to priority.
Neither can we see anj'sufficient reason for separating the genus into two sections as proposed by tliose authors.
Authentic specimens of the three European species GilbertsocTinuH calcaratus G. bursa G. mammilaris Phill. show that the pseudobrachial appendages occupy about the same relative position to the armopenings as in the American species and that they are not situated over the interbrachial or radial spaces but over the interradial areas.
We are inclined to believe that the misconception of the nature of the pseudobrachial appendages led to a misunderstanding of the arrangement of the body plates and that the interradial series has been mistaken for the radial one.
There is some variation in American specimens as to the position of the arm openings dependent upon the direction of the arms.
In the specimens in which Meek and Worthen found the true arms preserved they were penilent and from tliis fiict il was stated tliat in tliis genus tlie arms were always pendent and not erect as in the allied Ehodocrinus.
We ind this true in the species named as also in O.
H.s Hall of the Tpper Huilington  but in 0. iKhercnlosus the arms are erect and fold upward over tiie dome and while in the latter species the arm furrows and pinnules are jilaccd lilvc those in other crinoids on the upier or ventral side they are in 0.
I'lpni upon the under or apparentl dorsal side.
The same is the case in 0. tHberoaui L. and C from Crawfordsville.
This peculiar structure is easily exilained if we consider that the pendent position of the arms in these species is due not to a forcible bending out of their normal attitude but to the peculiar construction of the brachial parts which directs them downward and makes this their natural position and while it apiears as if the arm structure was entirely reversed in these two types this is reallj' not the case the furrow is still on the ventral side but the arms have rotated on their axes so as to bring it on the inner side when hanging down.
We have before us some twentyfive specimens of this genus mostlyof O.typus and 0. tuberculoaus about half of them having the false arms and eiglit the true arms preserved also.
The two species are very satisfactorily separated bj characters the most of which were not disclosed to the learned paleontologist who described them by the material at his command.
We therefore give briefly' their adilitional distinctive characters.
Ollacrinus typus Hall sp.
Interradials and anals varying from t and 11 in young specimens to 14 and 17 in mature individuals.
Pseudobrachial aipendages very large long and pendent spreading to nearly twice the diameter of the dome tapering gradually each joint having on the upper side a row of beadlike tubercles which vary in number and size in different individuals.
True arras as observed in five specimens pendent long and recumbent directed downward from the openings which originate in rather large deep cavities under the overhanging margins of the bases of the false arms.
The arms bifurcate on the second short free brachial plate and again on the third or fifth plate above after which they are simple and composed of a double series of small thin interlocking plates.'
' 0. itfberosus from Crawfordsville Indiana also has a double series of plates iu the arms instead of a single as described by Meek and Worthen.
The ambulacral farrow is on the under side of the arms and bears pinnules which point downward.
Trematocrinus painllahis.
Hall seems to be identical with 0. iypus for we find both the papillate nodes and long spines on specimens which nndoubtedl belong to the latter.
Ollacrinus tuberculosus Hall sp.
Anals and interradials about thirteen in adult specimens.
Pseudobrachial appendages without ornamentation short small rapidly tapering to a point.
The true arms as observed in three specimens are directed upward and folded over the dome with the ambulacral furrow and pinnules on the inner side as usual in crinoids.
Arm openings in small cavities on either side the base of the false arms.
Arms composed of a double series of plates and arranged as in 0. typus.
There are apparently four arms to the ray although in one instance a fifth one was observed.
Body plates large tuberculiform and not spiniferous.
This as well as all other Burlington species has two secondary radials supraradials and not three as stated.
In the fislibed locality the 0. typus existed in vast numbers but although the fragmentary remains of upwards of a hundred  individuals were traced there only a few were found in fair preservation.
They were mostly of larger size and more robust form than specimens from other localities the tubercles on the joints of the false arms were fewer in number and larger while the lower body plates were less prominently spinifei'ous.
Ollacrinus i'obustus Hall sp.
 from Keokuk seems to be larger and mox'e robust than the Burlington species but the Structure of the false arms is not described and we have never seen an authentic specimen of that species.
In Ollacrinus tuberosus L.  C.
sp.
 the only species of the genus described from the Keokuk limestone of Crawfordsville Indiana there is a marked distinction from the prevalent Burlington types in the false arms which are composed at their bases of four ranges of plates above and two below.
It is therefore an extremely interesting fact to find that in 0. obovatus M. and W.
sp.
 which occurs only at the verj uppermost part of the Upper Burlington beds there are also four ranges of plates in the upper side of the false arms which is the case in no other Burlinoton k species.
This is one of the rarest fossils of our rocks onlj fhree specimens having ever been found to our knowledge and in this isoliitofl crinoiil we hnvc aiiotlicr iiistnicUve illiisLration of the structural transitions b' wliieh t3'pes are niodilied in tlie successive epochs.
0.
DORYCRINUS etc.
The history of this genus in ihe Crinoidul liuiestone is of great inteiest.
The species of the Lower Jiurlington are small and all liave a single spine which is on the apex of the dome D. unicornis O. and Sh. is occasionally found with three in which case the nodes of the radial dome plates in the posterior rays are prolonged into small spines  an abnormit' upon which Hall founded his Acdnocrinus tricorniii.
This latter species cannot be upheld as we find those plates in every stage of development from nodose to spiniferous sometimes only one plate is prolonged the otheu one being normal.
Yet this variation is exceedingly' interesting as siiowing the first step toward a modification which in the Upper Burlington and Keokuk beds becomes a constant character in the species of those two beds the first radial dome plates not only of the posterior ray but of every ra' are prolonged into long spines.
The loioer bed Dorycrini have heav' arms flattened toward the tips and closely resembling those of some species' which Meek and Worthen refer to Eretnioci'inui but differing from them in being double from their origin instead of single as in Eretmocrinus.
In the upper bed species with the exception of D. jjarvus 0. and Sh  which has altogether the character of those from the lower bed the body is larger but the arms comparativel3' more slender shorter and less flattened while the central apical plate and the five first radial domeplates are produced into long spines as already stated.
In the transilion beds. the specimens attain a still larger size in D. inlermedius Meek and Worthen.
The dorsal side of the calyx which in all Burlington species is higher or at least as high as the vential here becomes proportionally lower while the opposite part above the arms predominates  and in the Keokuk species the latter is bfar the larger portion of the body.
In the Keokuk beds the extreme is reached.
The body and bodyplates are massive the spines which in the Burlington species increase with the progress in geological time here attain the immense length of 4 or 5 inches and in one species bear secondary spines.
Tliis species D. Gouldiwxih.
its extraordinary feature of spines on spines was exceedingly shortlived and disappears already in the lower part of the Keokuk where it first occurs.
A ver similar case is that of Strdtocrinus Meek and Worthen 111.

which in its typical form began in tiie Upper Buriington though its ancestry is very readily traced in certain Lower Burlington forms.
It apparently found favorable conditions in the upper beds for several species at once developed extreme proportions the rim at the brachial disk extending in some specimens nearljan inch and a half from the body all around.
These large forms are a very common and characteristic fossil in the middle part of the upper bed but above that they are scared' ever seen.
The smaller types are found somewhat higher but the genus is extinguisiied in this formation not a single specimen having ever been found in the Keokuk.
Barycrinus has a similar historj'.
Commencing in the Lower Burlington in species of moderate size it becomes in the Keokuk through transition forms which are with great difficulty separated into varieties one of the leading genera and attains in B. magister Hall sp.
and B. magnijicns M. and W. a gigantic size.
These large forms disappear with the Keokuk and the isolated species found in later formations are small in size and of rare occurrence.
Aniphoraci'inus appears in the Lower Burlington where it at once develops extraordinary features in the dome which is extended into a large but short proboscis surrounded hy very strong spines which sometimes give off four or five branches as large as the primarj' spine.
It reaches in America its climax in the Lower Burlington and no trace of it is found in any succeeding formation.
3Iegistocriniis Owen and Shumard after attaining an immense size perishes in the Upper Burlington.
Zeacrinus on the other hand like Cyathocriniis in its more prevalent small forms ranges almost unchanged through all the crinoidal beds it being verj' difficult to distinguish those from a different horizon by definite characters.
It even continues to flourish in somewhat similar forms in the later formations.
It seems from the foregoing observations to be a general fule in the crinoids of these formations that extravagant forms and 18 rank developments in structure arc not perpetuated and that types mostly cease to exist when they reach a culmination in anatomical features.
We have also seen that although crinoidal life existed abundantly throughout the formations under consideration a large proportion of the genera did not survive tliem  tliat where extinctions of generic types occurred it was generally upon their attaining a climax in growth  that the extinguishment of specific forms was not coincident with the close of the respective epochs of limestone deposits but that most of the changes were made by a series of slow and gradual modifications of specific characters which correspond in a striking manner with the changes in individual life by growth  that the silicious deposits while accompanied by great changes in the crinoidal forms instead of marking sharp distinctions between the limestone formations exhibit the gradations b' which the' are connected  that the smaller and less conspicuous forms were generally persistent and ranged through the whole crinoidal formations with comparatively little change.
We have by no means given all the data at our command bearing on the subject and our knowledge is necessarily limited.
Much further research is required before a thorough understanding of the questions herein discussed can be expected.
We are satisfied that a comparative study of the other organic remains so abundant in these rocks especially the Fishes Brachiopods and Bryozoa would yield facts similar to those observed in the crinoids.
But however imperfect our investigations we believe the evidence tends strongly to prove that the distinctions said to exist between these three limestone beds are to a great extent arbitrar that the relations between their crinoidal fauna are most intimate and that there is good reason for believing that they all belong to one great crinoidal epoch and should be classed accordingly by geologists.

The Low Governitig Sex.
 Mr. Thomas Meehan referred to his observations originally reported to the Academy developing an entirel' new view of the laws of sex from that formerly prevailing and which proved that what we called the female sex or final reproductive element in flowers required a higher grade of nutritive power to perfect than the male.
Thougli numberless facts have proved this point there have alwa3's been some which though the' have offered no obstacle have at least not been capable of explanation by the light of this theory and among these have been some connected with dioecious plants.
Among hermaphrodite and especiall' among monoecious plants there has been no difficult' in tracing the operation of this principle.
In such coniferous trees as pines firs and larches there is no difficult in perceiving that branches once bearing female flowers and maturing cones and seeds produce nothing but male flowers when the branches come in time to be weakened b' the shade of younger branches or in some other wa' are imperfectly nourished.
But when we come to the red cedar Junijyerus Virginiana where some trees are always wholly male and others alwaj's seed bearing no difference could be found in the vigor of the trees.
As in the monoecious cases we found the female element in exact proportion to nutritious advantages we looked for the seedbearing trees of the red cedar to be more vigorous than the males but found instead all equall' vigorous and healthy.
The enormous crops of seed borne b' the silver maple this 5'ear together witlthe confirmation of their truly dioecious character have not only furnished an explanation of the apparent anomaly but at the same lime affords one of the best possible illustrations of the new theory.
As already noted in communications to the Academy the flowers in Acer rubrum and Acer dasycarpum SiVe alike in all trees when the petals first open.
The anthers seem perfectly formed when another stage of growth commences.
The pistils elongate in the female flowers while the filaments remain stationary'' and the anthers never open  while in the male flowers the pistils do not grow but the filaments elongate and the anthers are carried on to perfection.
Each tree is in fact strictly a male or a female tree.
It is a matter within common knowledge that after the maturity of the immense crop of seeds last month the bearing trees were ciiiiniitivc'ly loalloss wliilf the coinplcU'l' Itanen male trees nlioiiiided witli foliajic 'JMuie is a wellknoAvn morpliologieal law that tlie arts of flowers and the resulting seed vessels are metaniorpiiosed leaves.
In the ease of tiiese maples the female trees eniraiied in developing primordial leaves to perfect fruit make few leaves in addition to those they started Avith in the spring until after several weeks their fruitage has een completed.
But the male flowers dying immediately on perfecting their pollen the male trees push at once into a heavy leaf growth clothing the tree at a ver' early period with a dense foliage.
But another consideration intrudes itself here.
The woody parts of a tree are made up mainly from the atmosphere through the medium of the leaves and we may suppose that the greater the proportionate amount of leaves the greater would be the woody product.
Appl3ing now these acknowledged principles to these maple trees we find some remarkahle results.
Notwithstanding the male trees are relieved from the enormous strain on the powers of nutrition which the annual and often wonderfully heavy crops must entail and notwithstanding they have as in many cases this season especially the advantage of a hundredfold more foliage at so early a period in the season male trees are no larger vigorous or in any way more healthy than the female ones.
In a crowded group of five trees where a female tree is the central one and a male on the outside tlie male with every advantage of food for the roots and light and air for its large crop of leaves and which happens to be an unusuall' large mass of foliage even for a male maple the girth of the trunk is four feet three inches while the crowded female tree is five feet five inches or two inches larger with all its disadvantages
AVe have been looking for weaker individuals in the male than in the female trees.
But since he had first made his discoveries we have learned to distinguish much more clearly between vegetative and reproductive force.
A large man is not necessarily a strong man in what we should call vital power but we measure it by endurance under severe trials and we see now that we need not have looked for weaker trees among the cedars or other dioecious trees so much as for powers of endurance under reproductive or other essentially vital strains.
Here we have this power thrown heavil in favor of the female tree and he submitted that dicccism in trees instead of being an objection is a powerful argument in favor of his views.
The President Dr. Ruschenberger inquired if Mr.
Median had ever noticed any difference in the longevity of the male and female trees.
Mr. Meehan replied that he had so far seen no difference.
On a Sivgxdar Tartar on the Teelh of a Sheep.
 Mr. E. Goldsmith called attention to a deposit upon the teeth in the lower jaw of a sheep.
The specimen had been exhibited at a previous meeting of the Academy by Dr. Harrison Allen.
He had received it from a gentleman who informed him that he had picked it up in the neighborhood of a silver mine in Mexico.
The grass near the mine was contaminated with silver amalgam and the sheep were said to have been poisoned by the herbage.
The peculiar tartar on the teeth was supposed to consist of silver amalgam.
Upon examination it was found that the tartar formed a thin scale covering tlie teeth so far as they were exposed.
The thickness was about 0.2 millimeter.
When viewed under a lens of moderate power the deposit seemed to have been built up gradually from within for on breaking a series of very thin layers were noticed of which the outer one apeared darker than those underneath.
The scales were very fragile.
Its lustre was truly metallic as no light could pass through it even on the thin edges but the lustre of the reflected rays of light were decidedly metallic and this property was alike throughout the scales.
These scales did not allow an impression to be made with the nail of the finger hence they were harder than silver amalgam.
If heated on platinum foil it blackened showing the presence of organic matter the form of the fragment did not change during the heating but the silvery lustre entirely disappeared.
Heated in the tube closed on one end at first a gray cloud arose then water and an oily matter deposited themselves on the upper or cooler end of the tube lower down near the now carbonized test a metallic layer was recognized with the aid of the lens.
The powdered substance being mixed with carbonate of soda and treated in the same way the result did not differ.
If melted on coal with the addition of carbonate of soda there was obtained a white enamel but no metal whatever.
In nitric acid the tartar was soluble as long as the solution was concentrated  if diluted with water a turbidity caused by the separation of an organic matter was formed.
This organic matter was soluble in caustic ammonia and from this ammoniacal solution it was again precipitable by nitric acid  the precipitate was flocculent not at all cheesy  it carbonized when heated and left no residue if the heating was prolonged for a suffice nt time.
The remaining solution from which this organic substance had been separated gave no reaction with hydrochloric acid the absence of silver being thereby proven.
A stream of sulphuretted hydrogen gave a precipitation in which a very little quantity of sulphuret of mercury was discerned.
Yery strong reactions of phosphoric acid and lime were observed in the nitric acid solution with the ordinary reagents.
This singular tartar is consequently not silver amalgam but the same material of which teeth are generallj' made modified however by the influence of a small quantity of mercury.
That metallic mercury is easily absorbed by the animal economy is well known it seems however not to have been noticed on the outside of the teeth before.

Anomia Andersonii M. .
n. s. Description.
 Shell tiiin siilnrbiciilir in outline Ijiit somewhat irreguhir beak subcentral marginal hinge line almost straight upper valve moderately convex.
Lower valve unknown.
The surface of the upper valve is regularly marked with obscure lines of growth and concentric wrinkles the latter become prominent laminae towards the ventral margin.
This shell will be readily distinguished from all other species of the genus by its marked regular prominent concentric wrinkles.
It preserves the ieculiar pearl' lustre characteristic of the genus remarkably well.
The greatest diameter of our Fig.
1 is 18 mm. and its smallest diameter is 15 mm.
The convxit3' of this specimen is about 4 mm.
Fositicm and locality.
 Cretaceous period  artesian well on the Citadel Green Charleston S. C. The shell ranges between the depth of 1880 feet to 1930 feet below the surface.
We have also the following cretaceous species from the strata between the depths mentioned.
Ostrea prudentia. White Odrea subspalna L.  S. with others which we are unable to identify on account of their broken condition.
The collection has been deposited in the Charleston College Museum.
A dorsal view of the upper valve showing the hinge line and prominent wrinkles near the ventral margin is given in Fig.
1.
This specimen is from the depth of 1920 feet and was found in a la'er of limestone.

ON UNIO SUBROSTRATXIS Say.
BY JAMES LEWIS M.l. MOHAWK N. J.
The records which relate to Unio snbrostrafits aflFord a curious instance of the obscurity in wliich the identity of a species ma' be involved through the influence of trifling 'errors.
Practically up to the present time U. subroslraliis has had scarcely' more value in scientific records than if it had never been described.
To dispel the obscurit' wliich invests this subject the records which most essentially bear upon the identification of the species will now be offered for consideration commencing with Say's description of the species transcrilied from page 134 of W. G. Binney's edition of Say's conchological writings. 
Unio subrostratus transversely elongated subrostrated radiated.
Inhabits Wabash.
Transversely elongate subovate brownish or pale ochreous with numerous darkgreen radii beaks but little elevated with a few small angular concentric lines  ligament margin a little compressed  anterior margin somewhat elongated hardly subrostrated  separated by an obtuse angle from the ligament margin  base arquated  posterior margin rounded  within white often slightly' tinted with flesh color somewhat iridescent on the margins particularlj' the anterior margin  substance of the shell not thick  teeth very oblique crested.
Length one inch and twofifths  breadth thi'ee inches and onefifth.
Convexity hardly over one inch.
This may be said to be the analogue of the U.
7iasiitus nob.
of the western waters.
The rostrum however is not so definite and it is a more convex shell.
The aged shell is darkbrown but near the beaks reddishbrown.
 January 15 1830 New Harmony Disseminator Siilsequently Mr. Say put Unio iris Lea in the sj'nonj'my of subrosb'atua' and this mistake on the part of Mr. Say maj' be presumed to be the source of the obscurity that subrostratus has ' Say reversed our present understaudhig of the anterior and posterior of Uniones.

of Say.
since been involved in.
There is no evidence to show that Mr. Say had any otiier knovledre of U. iris tlian a reading ol' Mr. Lea's descriition of tiiat species.
Mr. Lea in his treatment of synonymy follows Say's idea of the identity of iris and sub7ost7nus but places ijin first.
See Synopsis 1870 page fiO.
This serves to make the obscurity still more complete and were it not for Mr. Lea's footnote to iris on the page just cited sabrostialus might for all time have remained in the S3Mionymy of iris or what amounts to the same thing the two migiit continue to be regarded as identical.
As Mr. Lea's footnote affords an important hint by which the identification of subroslratus is aproached it is here transcriled. 
Mr. Say in his Synonymy gives ii'is as a synonym of subrostratus.
If they were the same I would be entitled to precedence as my description bears date March 1829 while his is January 183L IJis description however of subrostrafus does not apply to my iris and certainly this shell could not have been under his eye when his description ivas made.
He says that the subrostratus ' may be said to be the analogue of the Unio nasutus nobis of the western waters.'
As the U. iiasutus inhabits the western waters a variety of that species may have been described bjhim for subrostratus.
''  Lea's Synopsis 1870 page 60 footnote 4.
The most significant parts of the alove note are underlined In endeavoring to ascertain the facts which bear upon Mr. Lea's closing sentence in the above note I have obtained specimens of U. nasutus from the northern counties of Ohio the streams of which flow into Lake Erie.
In Indiana Illinois and Iowa my correspondents find shells which the' call nasutus but which are plainly referable to Lea's description and figure of U. Xashvillianus.
The males of this species satisfy the demands of Saj's description of subi'ostratus even to local reference a part of ray specimens being from the ponds of the Wabash.
Extending the inquiry I find that this species merges b' slight variations into the form known as U.
3Iississip2ne7sis Conrad.
The geographical distribution of U. subrostratus reaches Indiana Illinois Iowa Xebraska Tennessee Mississippi and Alabama.
Further investigations may reveal its presence in all the States along the Lower Mississippi.

PELAGIC AMPHIPODA.
BY THOMAS H. STREETS M.l. U.S.N.
The crustaceans to be li.scussed in this and subsequent paiers are oceanic species and are mostly found leniote from tiie land.''
They belong to Dana's subtribe Hyperidea and to Bate's division Hyperina.
There is a remarkable contrast between the two great divisions of Amphiioda  the Gaminarideaiin the Ilyperidea.
The former are generally found along shore in deeper water near the bottom or on floating material and there is a great resemblance running through all the species while the latter swim free in the midocean and there is the greatest diversity of characters among them.
The collection which has been placed in ray hands for idntification is probably the largest which has ever been gatliered together by a single individual.
It was collected by Surgeon William H. Jones U. S. Navy and his work embraces a period of about four years.
It comes from nearly the entire Paciflc Ocean north and south of the equator except the extreme high latitudes.
A portion of it now enriches the Academy's collection and the remainder has been retained by the collector.
The specimens were mostly taken with a towingnet at night which is about the only time when surface dredging can be carried on with any prospect of success.
I quote from the notes furnished by Dr.
Jones.
 Thosecaptured in daytime were taken under special circumstances such as discoloration of the water the presence on the surface of objects visible to the naked ej'e or when passing through schools of fish Velella Porpita or Fhysalia when some rare forms would be occasionally met with in the dredge or net.
The dredge was frequently' tried in daytime when the speed of the vessel would permit and towed for several hours at various depths ranging from the surface to forty fathoms without securing a specimen bejond a few that have an almost universal distribution while if the dredge was put over an hour or two afterwards when it had become dark they would be taken in great numbers.

STREETS ON PELAGIC AMPHIPODA the night have great influence in effecting their approach to the surface or within reach of tlie dredge.
A smooth sea a dak night especially if cloudjor squally or warm and sultry seems to be their favorite time for approaching the surface in the greatest numbers while on the other hand a moonlight night or high winds and a rough and heavy sea keep them from coming so near the surface.
Usually they approach the surface about twilight or within half an hour after dark and remain on or near the surface for two or three hours although occasionally they remain much later being apparently influenced by the darkness of the night and state of the weather.
I attach much importance to these notes as they give the first information we have had of the habits of these little animals.
I have noticed rajself that a great many of them when alive have the property of phosphorescence and it has occurred to me may it not be this which causes them to shun the light
They carry their own light about with them.

Concerning the Belcher specimen Adams and White say  We regret that the state of the only specimen in the British Museum is such that we cannot give the generic character with that detail which we should wish.
They also state that the drawing was made at the time of capture.
The following characters will denote the difference between R. armatum Bate and the present species.
The presence in the former of a tooth on the inferior margin of tiie fourth joint of the first pair of thoracic feet of a posterodorsal spine on the second and third abdominal segments the nonenlargement of the first joint of the fifth and sixth iairs of thoracic legs White's figure shows these to be enlarged and in the relative lengtiis of the first and last pairs of caudal apfiendages the first being longer than the last and reaching as far backward.

Forominifera of the Coait of New Jersey.
 Prof. Leidy remarlel that in recent visits to Cape May and Atlantic City he liad incidentally examined the shore sands for foraminifera.
In both localities between tides along the slight ridges left by the receding waves he had found an abundance of specimens lut they appeared all to belong to a single species which he snposed to be the Nonioinna niilleporn.
On the sandy beaclies of the rocky New England shores as at Newport K. I. and Noank Conn. he had observed a far greater quantity of several genera and species.
Sensitive Organs in Stapelia v.
..
Gibbons Hunt remarked that his attention had been called to the flower of Stapelia asterias by Mr. Isaac Burk who had expressed the opinion that it was probably a flycatcher.
The flovver of this plant is well known to botanists because of its extremely disagreeable and animal odor which appears to attract many flies when the flower is matured.
Continuous observation for several hours under a lens which took in a large field of view revealed many flies eagerly applying their tongues all over the petals and essential organs apparently eating with almost intoxicated relish the attractive excretion covering those parts.
This banquet was indulged in in safety until their tongues came in contact with one or more of five black spots situated near and alternate with the stamens when with amazing quickness the fly was seized and firmly held by the tongue a hopeless prisoner.
Now a struggle commenced and if the fly was small and not vigorous he remained in the trap but if large and strong his eflorts to escape vvere successful and he flew away dragging from its position the black sensitive spot and also the pollen masses two of wliich are attached to each trap.
This adhesion of the fly's tongue to these lilack spots is not caused by any cementing liquid but it is fairly caught by an organic structure the action resembling that of a common steeltrap used for catching rats.
The figure shows the arrangement and connection of these parts.
The organ at the junction of the pollen masses is the sen1878.
293 sitive trap find when touched however lightly by the Qy or other object as a hair for example the ojjposing separated parallel and hard edges instantaneously close like pincers and the prey is secured.
Stapelia belongs to the Asclepiadacea and analogous sensitive organs attached to the pollen masses exist in other genera and perhaps in all that natural order.
We have probably no other vegetable flycatcher so instantaneous in its action as the organ he had described and he could therefore confirm Mr. Burk's observation.

Sensitive Organs in Asclepias.
 Mr. Edward Potts stated that at the suggestion of Dr. Hunt he had examined such species of the genus Asclepias as were within his reach with tlie view to determine whether a sensitiveness and contractile power existed in tiie dark glandlike bodies associated with their pollen masses similar to those which Dr. Hunt had discovered in Stapelia.
On account of the lateness of the season his observations were limited to the A. incarnata native and a cultivated species the A. curassavicum and as these were identical as to the points under examination his description would be understood to apply to both.
The accompanying woodcut Fig.
1 clearly shows the position and form of the socalled glands which maj' be easily seen on the flower b' tlie aid of a pofket magnifying glass near tlie extremity of the pistil just peeiing out from beneath the mantles of adjacent anthers.
These latter are.
closely adherent to the pistil or more properly to its stigma and when separated therefrom present on the under side the appearance he iiad endeavored to show in fig.
2 of a pair of sacks or cases in which the pollen masses are suspended left open at the top apparently with a view to facilitate their withdrawal.
The sensitive glands are placed in shallow depressions upon the jierpendicular columnar ridges of the stigma and seem to be attached to it by a verdelicate easily ruptured membrane.
Fig.
3 reresents one of these as connected b' somewhat broad and twisted filaments with the two adjacent pollen masses of neighboringanthers not those belonging to the same.
In this sketch he had endeavored to represent it as open and expectant and in fig.

The fact of the removal of these groups b' insect agency has been frequently mentioned his ex Fijr.

294 1878. perimcnts liavc been made to tlctcnnine whether the glands themselves took an active part in the matter.
As these species seemed to present few attractions to the insect world and received but lew such visitors he was comjielled to use both force and strategy to accomplinh his ends.
He at first tried to insert a human Fig.
3. hair while observing the gland under tlie microscope but failed on account of the relatively large size of the hair and the difliculty of manipulating it where all directions were reversed.
His next plan was more succcssl'id  he caught house flies and held them by the wings above the flowers allowing their feet to scramble over them.
Almost immediately one or more of these would become ornamented by groups of the glands and iollen masses which clung so closely that their later struggles and rubliugs failed in any case to detach them.
The experiment of course was less conclusive as to the active agency of the gland than that mentioned by Dr. Hunt where in the Sfnpelia it closed on the hairs clothing the proboscis of its prey.
To avoid Fig.
4. the objection that the hooks and spines upon the insect's legs caught and drew out the glands by friction he tried a modification of his first experiment.
'J'aking a fine camel's hair pencil he brought its end gently periendicularly upon the summit of the flower sometimes without special guidance and sometimes directing some of its hairs towards a particular gland hi a few moments one of the many hairs would touch the sensitive inner surface of a gland causing it instanlly to contract and cling to the hair which tore it loose from the stigma.
The pollen masses uniformly remaining attached to it b' their filaments were withdrawn with it and the whole have in nearly every case remained together during all the manipulation required in the preparation and mounting of them as microscopic oltjects.
H is noticeable that the glands remain open and susceptible long after plucking the flowers in fact until they are nearly withered.
In a recent case he carefull' examined each gland upon one flower of a group which had been gathered twentyfour or fort'eight hours under a power of fift' diameters and found them in this condition  then with a camel's hair pencil but without violence he removed the whole five and again viewing them the change in position of the jaws iu every case was very observable.
If it should be conceded from the result of these experiments that there is at least a probability that motion can thus be excited in these glands it will appear further that tlie withdrawal of the pollen masses is so far within the plan of creation that it has not been left to the accident of occasional entanglement in the legs of insects.
But to what end is this rude witlidrawal 
The fertilization of the plant ly tlieir rupture upon the edges of the stigma is a A'er' natural suggestion.
But doubt is thrown upon the necessity for this exceptional method of fertilization when we notice the existence of a still more extraordinary one mentioned by Dr. Gray.
If we dissect and carefully examine a thoroughly matured flower just before its stigma and surrounding anthers have fallen we will piobably find some of the pollen masses materially modified in appeai'ance from tlieir earlier condition and sending forth alva3's from tlieir inner more convex edge a great bunch of pollen tubes which ienelrate the stigma at its lower extremity where it joins the apex of the styles.
In this view its fertilization instead of being as it would appear at first glance practically impossible without external help seems almost absolutely certain failing where our insect friends or some other form of violence may have extracted all the pollen masses before their tubes were protruded or where the latter may have failed to appear on account of the prior drying of the stigmatic surface.
In this connection he would refer to a recent observation in which the facts though far too few to establish a rule upon the question yet so far as the' go tend to confirm the opinion of Robert Brown as drawn from his own exerience viz. that fertilization in this family of plants does depend largely upon insect agency.
In three instances Mr. Potts had noticed upon flowers of A. curasHavicum beside their own normal features another sensitive gland and its attached pollen masses which must have been brouglit there .by some external agency.
In each ease one mass of the pair had been inserted under the edge of an anther in the immediate vicinity of another pollen mass occupying its natural position  that is while the latter was in the former was under the antheridial sack and of com se close against the sloping lower surface of the stigma.
The first found of these three instances was not examined more particularly but the other two forming parts of separate groups of flowers upon the same stem were marked the twig kept alive in water for several days to allow time for the formation of pollen tubes and then careful
dissected.
It is worthy of remark that by this time every other flower of each group had withered and fallen leaving these alone.
On dissection it was found that each of these inserted pollen masses had thrown forward a profusion of pollen tubes towards the point of junction of the stigmawith the extremities of the styles and though he could not detect their entrance into the latter fertilization had probably been efliected as the ovaries had noticeably increased in size.
None cf the masses wliicli ofciipicd tluir natural position liad Ibrnic'd tubes though in several a strouily marked granulation and tendency to rupture apeared in those eells atij'ining the convex inner edge.
If it be allowable to deduce a theory from tlie observation of so few facts when these are confirmed ly so high an authority as Robert Hrown he would suggest that while there is no imperative physical obstacle to selffertilization in these plants the inner membrane of the anther leing cut away apparently for the purpose of romoting or allowing it as seen in fig.
2 yet the maturity of the pollen masses is reached so late that the stigma of the same flower has frequently lost its susceptible condition as to moisture etc. before that period arrives.
When however the pollen masses jertainiug to one of the earlier flowers are removed by insects and lodged in the position above described upon another just opened the' find and respond to the more favorable circumstances and crossfertilize that flower.
A motif is thus suggested for the sensitive character noticed in the above described glands and the care taken b' this means to insure the frequent transplantation of the pollen masses into other flowers.

We find in our notes taken in June 1871 tins species as having been identified witli the following remarks This curious holothurian is particularly noticeable on account of its transparent''.
They are found at lowwater in the sand marshes abundantlj As Prof. Verrill considers it a northern form we irefer to mark it as doubtful.

Campanularia carolinensis Verrill sp.
nov. A small species creeping over the stems of Aglaophenia remarkable for tlie unusually large gobletshaped hydrothecse which are supported on short and slender pedicles.
Rootstalks slender translucent wrinkled but not regularly annulated giving off at short intervals the slender pedicles which are shorter than the cups mostl having only four or five somewhat irregular and imperfect oblique annulations.
Hydrothecte deep cupshaped or gobletshaped with a smootli thin slightly everted rim.
These cups are nearly twice as deep as wide and about twice as long as the pedicles.
They taper toward the narrow base with a gradual curvature the basal portion is considerably thickened internally with a small septum very near the bottom.
Gonothecse unknown.
Height of hydrothecai 1 mm.
 diameter .60 mm length of pedicles .45 mm.
Collected by Dr. Yarrow.
Owing to the absence of gonothecai the reference of this species to Campanularia is only provisional.

Sertularia Desmoscyphus Achilleee Verrill ep.
nov.
Stem alternately pinnate articulated each segment bearing first a branch and then about three hydrothecre arranged alternately branches somewhat elongateiJ simple on our specimen distinctly articulated near the base below the first hydrotheca beyond this the articulations are rather indistinct and irregular  the internodes usually apiearing to bear two three or more pairs of opposite secund hydrothecae which are adnate to the branch and to each other and so placed on the upper side of the brancii as to have both their apertures turned upward and outward the hydrothecae are stout swollen in the middle with the upper free portion bent abruptly outward nearly at a right angle and tapering rapidl' to the aperture which is distinctly bilobed the lobes rounded.
The intervals between the hydrothecaj about equal them in length.
On the main stem the hydrothecje have nearly the same form lut are alternate and distant from each other though still somewhat secund.
Height of the specimen probably young 33 mm.
 length of longest branches 5 mm.
Gonotheca unknown.
This peculiar species would belong to the genus Desmoscyphus of Allman but it unites that group still more closely to the true Serlidarise.

Porpitae Physalia pelagica Lamarck.
Dr. Coues in a former paper Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
1871 p. 148 mentions the occurrence of a Physalia in the locality under discussion which has been since recognized as P. pelagica.
In March 1871 large numbers were noticed in and beyond the surf and on the seabeach after a severe storm from the southward.
A number of specimens were secured among them one which had a small dead fish entangled in its long tentacular hydroid appendages.
Most of those upon the beach were dead and could be handled with impunit' but when living the stinging produced b' touching the hydroid tentacles is ver apparent and painful.
Dr. Yarrow on one occasion was consulted by a fisherman who seeing the animal floating on the water reached out and grasped it but paid dearly for his temerity as when seen the entire arm to the shoulder was very red much swollen and exquisitely' painful.
The irritation lasted several days and was allayed by a saturated solution of bicarbonate of soda.
The Physalia may be handled without danger if seized by the corrugated crest of the bladderlike portion.
It is supposed b' many that this animal is a virulent poison and that fish eating it also become poisonous.
Mons.
P. Lali.it in liis Book of Voyages mentions that several persons eating of a lisli that devours the PhiKnlia became dangerously ill but this siclvuess ma' liave leen iroduced by other eauses.
However tins may be Dr. Yarrow saw a case in which a small terrier dog died in a very short time after eating a iiecc of the hydroids of this species.
Upon making a postnortem tlie stomacli was found entirely empty with the exception of the piece of the animal eaten and greatly congested.
Mons.
Ricord Madiana made a series of experiments to test the poisonous qualities of Phisalia and arrived at tiie conclusion that it is not poisonous apart from the stinging property.
Specimens secured at Fort Macon were about six inches wide on the bladder portion with hj'droids five or six feet long.
Tliey were of a beautiful'
iridescent purplish color.
Porpita sp.
A single siecimen of this genus was found stranded on the seabeach which Prof. A. Agassiz informs us was possibly P.pacijica or P. Linnveana of Lesson but unlike the latter the hydroid appendages were bright 3ellow in color.

INSECTS.
It might be supposed from the paucity of vegetation near Fort Macon that this class would be but poorly represented such is not the case as during the sojourn of the authors of this paper at that place hundreds of different specimens were collected and forwarded to competent specialists for examination.
Unfortunatel' names only for the Coleoptera and Orthoptera have been received for the former from Dr. G. W. Horn of Philadelphia for the latter from Dr. P. R. XJhler of Baltimore to whom our heart' thanks are due for their favors.
We regret particularly being unable to furnish the names of more of the Lepidoptera as the collection was large being particularly rich in moths.

A young specimen of this wellmarked and valid species occurs in the collection made at Fort Macon N. C by Dr. A. S. Packard Jr. and I am informed by Mr. Faxon that tliere are specimens in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge from the Bermudas.
It is readily separated from the common Cancer irroraluff Say by the granulated carapax and the crenulated anterolateral teeth.
This species was described by Say l. c. as the female of his C. irroratus.
But it was first pointed out by Dr. Gould that it was a distinct species.
He however thought proper to retain the name for this species rather than the more common form which Say regarded as the male.
 It ranges from Nova Scotia to the West Indies.

Alpheus formosus Gibbes 1. c p. 196.
When working at my Synopsis of the Xortli American Alpliei I found specimens in the Museum of Yale College collected by Dr. H. C. Yarrow at Fort Macon.
This is its farthest north.
I have also examined specimens from Florida Bermudas West Indies and the Bay of Panama.
This species can readily be separated from any other Caridean likely to be found at Fort Macon by the three spined front and the great disproporliou in the anterior pairs of chelipeds.
In the Annual Report of the U. S. Geological and Geograpliical Surveys of the Territories for 1874 p. 388 Mr. Ernest Ingersoll saj's  From the pond mentioned between cams E.  F. in southwestern Colorado a small crab was brouglit home which Prof. S. I. Smith pronounced to be a true marine form belonging to the Asfacidoas sic.''
Prof Smith informs nie that the specimen shown to him was undoubtedly Alpheus minus and thought it more than probable that some confusion of localities or mixture of specimens had occurred but on the other hand Mr. Ingersoll is as positive as it is possible to be that the specimen was found in the pond mentioned.

Mr. Lockington informs me that his A. equidactylus from Monterey Cal. presents no appreciable differences from specimens of A. heterochelis from Florida that I sent him.
This species is readily recognized by its front with a single spine its enormous hand and is larger than the preceding species.
Stimpson in his  Trip to Beaufort N C American Journal Sciences and Arts 2d series vol xxix p 444 mentions a species of Alpheus under the name A. intermedius.

On the Black Mildew of Walls.
 Prof. Leidy remarked that in the nnmber of  Hardwicke's Science Gossip for August presented this evening there is an article by Prof. Paley entitled  Is the Blackness on St. Paul's merely the effect of Smoke.
According to the author the blackness is mainly due to the growth of a hitherto undescribed lichen which appears to flourish only on limestone and in situations unaffected by the direct rays of the sun.
Prof. Leid continued that his attention had been called a number of years ago to a similar black appearance on the brick walls and granite work of houses in narrow shaded streets especiall in the vicinity of the Delaware River.
Noticing a similar blackness on the bricks above the windows of a brewery from which there was a constant escape of waterj' vapor in a more central portion of the city he was led to suspect that it was of a Aegetable nature.
On examination the black mildew proved to be an alga closely allied to what he supposed to be the Frotococcus viridis which gives the bright green color to the trunks of trees fences and walls mostly' on the more shaded and northern side everywhere in our vicinity.
It probably may be the same plant in a different state but until proved to be so may be distinguished by the name of Frotococcus luguhrii.
It consists of minute round or oval cells from 0.006 to 0.009 mm.
in diameter isolated or in pairs or in groups of four the result of division  or it occurs in short irregular chains of four or more cells up to.
a dozen occasionally' with a lateral offset of two or more cells.
The cells by transmitted light appear of a brownish or olivebrovvuish hue.
In mass to the naked ej'e the alga apears as an intensely black powder.

A paper entitled ' Description of a supposed New Species of Smynthurus by John A. Ryder was presented for publication.
Remarks on 3Iactra.
 Prof. Leidy remarked that the most frequent and conspicuous shell met with on the sandy coast of New Jersc was the Beachclam Maclra solidissima.
The living mollusk was thrown up in great numlcrs during severe storms and high above the position reached b' ordinary' tides its dead shells are thickl' strewn over the sands.
Shells are often met with having a smooth circular hole bored near the umbo wliich appeared to be due to Natica heros for several years ago at Atlantic Cit' on the beach near lowtide mark.
Prof. L. had dug out of the sands many specimens of Natica each of which embraced a beachclam.
The tongue of the Natica covered witli strong teeth and over an inch long formed a rasp well adapted for boring the shell of its prey.
Why the Natica always made choice of the position near the umbo for boring through the sliell did not appear clear though perhaps it might have something to do with reaching the adductor muscles of the shell of the Mactra.
These are equidistant from the perforation and if torn tiirough by the tongue of tlie Natica would cause the shell of the Mactra to open and thus render all the soft parts more accessible.
The Mactra lives in the sands of tlie coast and appears to feed chiefly on diatoms and perhaps infusorians.
Prof. L. had been surprised at the number of different genera and species of diatoms found in the contents of the intestines of the jIactra though from an observation recently made these delicately constructed plants would appear to thrive even on shore exposed to the disturbance of the ocean waves.
Near the inlet at xVtlantic City the beach betAveen tides was noticed in many places to be covered with streaks and patches of a yellowishgreen hue and of extreme thinness.
Some of this colored matter with sand was scraped up and put into a bottle and taken home for examination.
After a lew hours' rest the green matter diffused through the sanfl and water in the bottle formed a thin layer on the sand.
Under the microscope the green matter proved to be composed of a single diatom the Amhiprora conatricta.
It was in a remarkable state of activity and Prof. L. added he thought he had never beheld an' other diatom so much so as this one.
Its power of movement and its broad keels were conditions which wonderfully favored its ability to extricate itself from the sand to occupy a position on the surface.
Diatoms from their constitution are admiraMy adapted as food for the beachclam oyster and other lamellibranch moUusks.
Tlie' are crj'stal cases containing besides the endochrome a quantity of colorless protoplasm and considerable drops of oil.
They might be likened to boat loads of corn meat and oil.
In the materials of the commencement of the intestine of clams and oysters Prof. L. had observed the diatoms with the contents in various conditions of change due to digestion  and in the materials of the rectum the diatoms were empty or had been deprived of theii contents.
In several beachclams examined among the matter of the intestine Prof. L. had observed what he at first supposed to be the shell of a difflugian but which he since suspected to be that of a ciliated infusorian Tintinnuii.
Inform and construction tlie shell resembles that of T. annulatun Fig.

Irrilahle or Sensitive Stamens.
 Mi Thomas Meetian remarked on the large list of plants now known that exhibited an irritative motion in some of their parts.
A few years ago there were few in the list besides the Sensitive plant and the Venus fl3'trap  now there were many scores of similar cases known though chiefly as regai'ds the stamens or portions of the pistils.
He had already placed on record a large number of instances in plants of the orders Bignoniaceae ScropJiulariacese and Acanthaceae and he had found so many cases that he thought wherever there were bilobed flattened stigmas in these orders we might expect to find this sensitiveness to touch exhibited in a greater or less degree.
In regard to stamens it was well known that in Opiintia a famil' of Gactaceae the stamens moved in various directions when touched and it was ver' remarkable that no such motion had been observed in Cereus Mammillaria.
and other allied genera of the order.
Having noted a similar motion in the stamens of the common garden Porlulaca grandiHora he was led to look for and to find a similar motion in the Purslane Portulaca oleracea.
Examining another Portulacaceous plant Talinum teretifolium last year he could find no trace of motion but when on his recent jouiney south he found growing in the Botanic Garden of Mr. Henry Shaw of St. Louis a West Indian species Talinum patens in whicli the expanded stamens fell down on the petals when touched.
It was remarkable that this power should exist in T. patens and not in T. teretifolinm though some approach to this excepfeional character was already noted in the genera though not among the species of Gactacese.
Tlic olijects of these movements mayet form an interestin study.
In Dionnn o.sfY anl some others the motion liad been loiuid to icsull in some immediate benefit to the phint  in Mimoxa Ji'disarioit and others no such immediate benefit had lieen suggested.
In the ease of sensitive stigmas it had been supposed to have some refurenie to arrangencnts for erossffrtilizatioM.
But this was doult'ul for the folhnving reasons In the ease of 3Iinnli. iiiKjois tlie stigmas exanded and tlie antliers bspersed tiieir jjolleu lefoie tlie corolla was juite oien and pollen migiit be generally found on the stigmatic surfaces when the mouth exjjosed these parts to view.
In Tfcoma iadinans on the other hand the lobes of the pistil did not expand till some time after the mouth of the corolla was open.
In many cases pollenhunting bees had carried away all the pollen before these lobes expanded.
In cases where the expanded lobes and dispersing polkn were simultaneous it was theoretically supposed that a bee or insect touched the lobes with its olleucovered head or back and that the lobes then closed against the admission of pollen on the withdrawal of the insect from the flower.
IJut he had found tliat the bees in the cases observed by him occupied but from three to five seconds in visiting a flower while it took from thirty to sixty seconds for the lobes to close and then they were seldom so completely closed as to render the reception of fresh pollen diflicult.
lie thought from these and other facts tiiat the h.ypotliesis in relation to cross fertilization was untenable and tliat the real use of this motion in the economy of nature was an ojeu and jet promising field to the future investigatr. September 24.
