The following papers, on report of the Committees to which they had been referred, were ordered to be published in the Proceedings.
Catalogue of the species of BEMBIDITIM found in the United States and contiguous Northern Kegions.
BY JOHN L. LECONTE, M. D. On revising recently my collection of the species of the genus named above, I regretted to find, that in former years I had been led to describe as distinct species, many which a more practiced eye now leads me to consider as varieties.
The number, also, of well-defined species, being very great, I have thought it important to attempt to separate them into definite groups, which, by containing a comparatively small number of species, would facilitate the subsequent labors of the student endeavoring to identify his specimens.
[Jan. With this object in view, I sought the divisions established by Jacquelin Du Val, in his admirable treatise " De Bevibidiis Europacis"* among our own species, but was much disappointed to find them not at all applicable.
After repeated trials to reduce a system on the characters of Du Val, which should present a natural series when applied to the species before me, I was at length compelled to adopt another method of division, the result of which is presented below.
But first with regard to the limits of Ochthedromus Lee.
and its claims to regard as a natural genus.
European entomologists have thus far refused to place it in their system, adhering to the view that the subulipalpate Carabica, with few exceptions, (Anillus is received by all, Thalassobius and Tachypus by a few) form but one great genus Bembidium.
From this view I ventured to dissent many years ago, but more distinctly in ray notes on the classification of the CarabidiB of the United States,* where the Trechi and Berabidia were widely separated on a difference in the mesothoracic parapleurae ; these in the former are divided by a suture near the posterior margin, and in the latter by a diagonal suture.
I also found that in the Trechi the marginal stria of the elytra was interrupted at the middle, while in the Bembidia it was entire.
Renewed observation has confirmed the result then obtained, and has induced me still farther to enlarge the group of Trechi, by adding to it not only Tachys, but also Anillus, the form recognized by me as Blemus, (which is probably not genuine Blemus), and Lymnaeum, which has been found on the coast of California, at San Diego.
Thus of the genera in my table (loc.
cit.
39'7) there remains only Pericompsus, Bembidium, Octhedromus, Hydrium,''and Patrobus.
The last named genus must form a group by itself, or at least separate from Bembidium, and more nearly allied to Pterostichus, or Platynus.
Hydrium does not appear to be sufficiently definite to be retained.
Of the three genera thus retained, Pericompsus is known by the antf.rior tarsi of the male being hardly or not at all dilated, by the anterior tibiae being obliquely truncate at tip, and by the elytra being without scutellar strije : the mentum tooth is small and acute.
Bembidium and Ochthedromus differ from Pericompsus only by the male having two joints of the anterior tarsi dilated, by the anterior tibise being somewhat rounded at tip, and by the elytra having a short scutellar stria.
They differ among themselves by the comparative size of the middle portion of the mentum, which in the species with impressed square spots is longer and broader than in the others, and also in the comparatively larger size of the first dilated joint of the anterior tarsi in the same species.
Nevertheless, taking into account the great variations in character, especially of the mentum, in other groups, it seems to me more natural again to unite them into one genus, to be called Bembidium.
And with a view of shewing the relations between the different groups, the following table may be made use of.

Indes to the BUPEESTID.ff; of the United States, described in the work of Laporte and Gory, with notes.
BY JOHN L. LECONTE, M. D. Having recently procured, after many exertions, a complete copy of the Histoire Naturelle et Iconographie des Insectes Coleopteres, by MM.
Laporte and Gory, I have thought that a catalogue of the native species of Buprestidse described in the work, which has heretofore been inaccessible to the American student, would, perhaps, tend to the more easy recognition of many of our species.
In consequence of the confusion which now reigns among the genera of the family mentioned, the time is not yet propitious for a synopsis of all the native species; but with the appearance of the fourth volume of Lacordaire's work on the Genera of Coleoptera, this difficulty will be removed, and the real [Jan. characters of the misconceived and wrongly described genera now mentioned in the books will be recognized.
In the meantime, however, the synonymical aid to be derived from reference to the monograph of Laporte and Gory must not be overlooked.
The dates of publication are as follows: vol.

ALUMINIUM.
The progress in its manufacture.
BY W. J. TAYLOR.
The use of sodium in the reduction of metals from their chlorides, as has been so successfully accomplished within the last two years, may be justly considered a great progressive step in science.
Aluminium has been the first in which this process has been perfected.
What the other metals are which will be reduced successfully from their chlorides by the use of sodium, the future will determine.
Some facts concerning the early history of aluminium, the progress made in its manufacture, and the numerous uses to which it can be applied, will not be uninteresting.
Much confusion existed in the minds of the early alchymists regarding the oxide alumina.
They knew of an alum which was brought from the East, which they regarded for a long time as sulphuric acid combined with an earth.
Stahl and others also mistook this earth for lime.
Geoffroy, in 1728, pointed out its existence in clay; Marggraff, in 1754, proved it to be a substance having a sepa1857.]
rate existence and peculiar characters.
To Oerstedt belongs the credit of first preparing the chloride of aluminium, from which compound W5hler, in 1827, succeeded in first eliminating the metal.
Wohler first obtained aluminium in the form of a grey powder, by heating gradually in a porcelain crucible over a spirit lamp equal volumes of metallic potassium and chloride of aluminium ; other chemists, by slight modifications of this process, have obtained aluminium in the form of the grey powder, as first obtained by Wohler.
To M. Sainte Claire Deville belongs the credit for first improving the process, so as to produce aluminium in such quantities that its characters as a metal could be fully investigated.
M. Ste.
Claire Deville used in his process sodium as a substitute for potassium.
(It requires 39 parts of potassium to produce the same reductive effect as 23 parts of sodium.)
At the time of his first experiments sodium was worth one hundred dollars per pound ; he so improved the process for making this metal as to reduce the price to ninety cents per pound.
At this time the chloride of aluminium was regarded witli sodium as a curiosity of the laboratory ; it was then produced in small quantities by heating alumina mixed with coal, in a porcelain tube, and passing over it a current of dry chlorine gas.
M. Ste.
Claire Deville made farther improvements in this process, so as to make it in an apparatus as large as a gas retort and in quantities proportional, at a price of twenty-five cents per pound.
To produce the reaction of sodium with the chloride of aluminium was the most difficult point of the entire process.
M. Ste.
Claire Deville used for the reduction the distillation of the chloride of aluminium over the sodium, which was placed in trays of copper enclosed in a tube.
The temperature developed by the reaction is very great if the current of the chloride of aluminium be rapid ; by this process it was found that it required at least ten pounds of sodium to produce one pound of aluminium, (part of the aluminium produced being destroyed at its formation by the scorise,) when by theory it required only two and a half pounds.
This great loss of sodium and the difficulties in conducting this reaction on a large scale, were very great objections to the process.
All the aluminium at the Paris Exhibition was made by this process, and it was from a portion of this that M. Regnault made his investigations, and in which he found copper and iron.
The copper came from the trays in which the reduction was made.
The presence of these metals in small quantities will account for the peculiar physical properties which he ascribed to aluminium.
Circumstances having interrupted M. Ste.
Claire Deville in the experiments which he was making on a large scale, the subject rested for a while here.
In the meanwhile Heinrich Rose suggested and made experiments with cryolite, (a fluoride of aluminium and sodium,) and gave his views that this mineral was a valuable substance from which to produce aluminium.
Wfthler made experiments also with cryolite, and arrived at conclusions somewhat similar to Heinrich Rose.
They both succeeded in producing some of the metal, but the results were not entirely satisfactory.
M. Ste.
Claire Deville again resumed his experiments, but instead of distilling the chloride of aluminium on the metallic sodium, as in his first experiments, he fused in a crucible, in the manner pursued by Rose and Wohler, using, however, with the double chloride of aluminium and sodium and the metallic sodium, the fluoride of calcium, (fluor spar,) or some cryolite as a flux.
This experiment of M. Deville was very satisfactory, and the reduction in accordance with the theory.
While these experiments were in progress in Europe, similar ones were being made in this country by Mr. Alfred Monnier, in Camden, N. J. ; to him credit is due for having first made aluminium in the United States.
Having had opportunities for examining his processes for making the double chloride of aluminium and sodium, metallic sodium, and the modes of reduction, melting and refining the aluminium, the conclusion is satisfactory that the discoveries of science have been successfully applied to render the manufacture of this metal an industrial art.
[Jan. Mr. Monnier in his experiments met with the same diCBculties in the reduction.
He found, however, by careful investigation and analysis, that the effect produced was also perfectly in accordance with the theory.
When, after great difficulties, sufficient quantities of pure aluminium were obtained, and its properties as a metal carefully studied ; it was found that it was not in the least degree oxidized by fusion with the nitrate of potash.
This peculiar property causes a strong contrast between it and any well known metal, and this wonderful fact produced a new phase in the manufacture of aluminium.
Owing to this discovery, the efforts which had been made to produce aluminium from perfectly pure material were found unnecessary.
By using pure materials for its manufacture, it was necessary to employ apparatus which was very costly, as it required that it should be free from any injurious substances.
By the facility with which aluminium can be refined, owing to its peculiar properties to resist oxidation, it can be manufactured from impure and crude materials, in apparatus which can be cheaply made of still cheaper material, and without the great care and watchfulness necessary in the manipulations, where pure materials are employed.
Since July, 1855, Mr. Monnier has made the double chloride by mixing alumina with salt (chloride of Sv/dium) and coal, and bypassing over this mass (ignited) a current of dry chlorine gas, (kaolin or common clay can be used instead of the alumina.)
The double chloride runs out from the condenser in a stream, and is collected in a receiver; it becomes solid when cold.
The reaction is so complete that no chlorine is lost.
It has already been manufactured at a cost of eight cents per pound, but the operations were carried on to a very limited extent.
It is, however, clearly (to be) demonstrated that, with works of sufficient size and a proportional economy in manufacture, the double chloride of aluminium and sodium, can be produced at a cost not exceeding four and a half cents per pound.
In the manufacture of sodium Mr. Monnier has made considerable improvement; it has already been produced at a cost of twenty-five cents per pound.
In the manufacture of zinc (by the Belgian process) one retort produces about thirteen pounds of metal in 24 hours.
In the manufacture of sodium the reduction is so quick that 52 pounds of this metal can be produced in a retort of the same size in the same space of time.
The reduction of zinc costs from two to two and a quarter cents per pound.
The amount of ore necessary, being from a half to three-quarter cents per pound.
Giving for the cost of one pound of metal about three to three and a quarter cents.
The reduction of sodium costs about ... 4 cents per pound.
The carbonate of soda, 2^ lbs.
at 4 cents, .
.
10 " •' Giving for total cost of one pound of sodium, .
.
14 " Sodium can be manufactured on as large a scale as zinc, and when the workmen have the same practical experience in the manipulations, the price of reduction will be still farther reduced, so that the difference between it and zinc will be that of the first cost of carbonate of soda and the zinc ore.
It has already been shown that the double chloride of aluminium and sodium can be produced at a very low price ; metallic sodium can also be made very cheaply ; the reduction is readily effected in accordance with the theory, but the difficulty in uniting the metallic globules of aluminium when formed, is obviated by stirring at this point with a rod, and the destruction of the metal by the alkaline scoria is prevented by adding to the charge of the double chloride of aluminium and sodium, chloride of sodium and metallic sodium, either fluoride of calcium, (fluor spar,) or cryolite.
By these means the greater portion of the metal is united in one mass, the other portion of the metal in small globules remain with the slag, which can be removed mechanically, or by first digesting in water ; there will however remain 1857.]
about ten per cent, with the slag.
This will be explained by the following data.
Theoretically: • 250 parts of metallic Sodium produce 100 " " Aluminium; VO parts are obtained in one metallic mass ; 20 " " in metallic globules ; 90 " being the nett produce.
10 " remain with the scoria.
Total, 100 The alkaline scoria contains large quantities of the chloride of sodium, that can be easily extracted by water, leaving an insoluble residue from which the fluoride of aluminium can be extracted by volatilization.
The scoria containing the fluoride and the metallic aluminium is economically used by introducing it again with a new charge of the double chloride of aluminium and sodium, and metallic sodium, and by that means the loss of the metal is rendered very small.
Aluminium, when carefully removed from any slag, is readily fused in a crucible by itself; when in fusion (which is at a lower point than that required to fuse silver) the whole is stirred with a rod, and all the globules of metal are united in one mass with the greatest facility ; at this point nitrate of potash ca,n be added, (the stirring continued.)
All other metals are oxidized by this process ; the refining is finished when the metal has a pure white color.
It can now be poured into a mould of smy shape.
Impure aluminium may be whitened by plunging it into caustic potash or soda, washing it quickly with distilled water, plunging it again into pure nitric acid, again washing quickly and thoroughly.
The surface then has the fine white color of pure aluminium, which it retains unless afterwards polished.
This operation has for its object to dissolve out the metals which darken the color of aluminium by their presence.
Aluminium forms alloys with nearly all the metals, but those which it forms with silver and copper are the most interesting.
Five parts of aluminium with one hundred parts of pure silver produce an alloy almost as hard as a silver coin, which contains about one-tenth of copper, so that sufficient hardness can be given to silver, without introducing into it a poisonous or an alterable metal.
It has the advantage of being worked like silver in a pure state, possessing, however, greater hardness, and being capable of a higher polish.
Ten parts of aluminium and ninety parts of copper produce an alloy of a pale gold color, possessing great hardness and considerable malleability ; its hardness is greater than that of bronze, in the proportion of fifty-one to forty-nine.
It can be worked when warm, with the same facility as the best soft iron.
Twenty parts of aluminium and eighty of copper give to the alloy the color and brilliancy of fine gold, and at the same time sufficient hardness to scratch the alloy of gold employed in coin, without imparing in the slightest degree its malleability.
By an increase of the per centage of copper in alloys of aluminium the alloy is rendered brittle, showing that the metal must be either used pure or alloyed in small quantities with the copper.
This explains the peculiar properties ascribed to it by M. Regnault in his investigations on the physical properties of the aluminium prepared by M. Deville, exhibited at the Paris exhibition.
Numerous experiments have been made (without regard to economy of manufacture) to obtain the aluminium directly from the oxide alumina, or from the fluoride of aluminium.
But the results obtained by the use of this double chloride of aluminium and [Jan. sodium, have fully demonstrated that it is the most economical mode by which to produce this metal.
Theoretically it requires — 3-86 Chlorine, at 6 cents per pound, .
.
.
-23 16-100 1-86 Alumina, at 3 " " 05 58-100 5-68 Carbonate of Soda, at 4 cents per pound, .
-22 72-100 Total, -51 46-100 Making for the materials for manufacturing one pound of aluminium, estimated at the market prices, 51^ cents.
Practically it requires — 16 lbs.
of the double chloride of aluminium and sodium, at 8 cts.
per lb., $1 28 2| lbs.
metallic sodium, at about 25 cents per lb., .... 70 Flux aud cost of reduction, 2 02 Total, $4 00 By manufacturing on a larger scale, and by using the slag as a flux instead of employing fresh material, the lowest cost will be reduced to the following : 10 lbs.
of double chloride of aluminium and sodium, at 4J cents per lb., $0 45 2\ lbs.
of sodium, at 14 cents per lb., ....... 35 Cost of reduction, 20 Total, $1 00 It is seen that the actual cost of one pound of aluminium, when manufactured extensively, will be about double the theoretical cost as before estimated, (fiftyone cents.)
For the production of aluminium are used clay, salt, sulphur, manganese, lime and fluor spar, materials which are very abundant and cheap ; all that is now required is practical experience, to reduce the price of the metal still nearer to the price of the raw materials, as has been before stated.
The history of the useful arts coutains numerous instances that, where skill and perfection of apparatus are required, difficulties are speedily overcome.
The density of aluminium when moulded is 2-56.
The density of aluminium when rolled is 2-67.
In equal weight with silver it is four times more voluminous.
In equal weights with copper, bronze, brass and German silver, it possesses from three to three and a half times greater volume.
In equal volumes with the above metals and alloys it possesses greater rigidity.
Mention has already been made of a very important property of aluminium when pure ; that is to resist oxidation, a property which it possesses to a greater degree than the other metals.
Aluminium is not acted upon by nitric acid, hydrosulphuric acid, or by the organic acids ; slightly by sulphuric acid.
It is but little affected by fusion with sulphur ; mustard is found to act upon it slightly.
Its true solvent is hydrochloric acid.
When we compare it in these respects with those metals, which are acted upon by most of these acids giving salts, which are more or less poisonous, the comparison is favorable to aluminium, as its salts, if formed, are innocuous.
According to M. C. Tissier, aluminium is not changed by a solution of nitrate or sulphate of copper, but it is dissolved by a solution of chloride of copper with the separation of metallic copper.
It is attacked, however, by a solution of nitrate or sulphate of copper when it contains chloride of sodium, and this proves that chloride of copper is formed by the presence of the chloride of sodium.
Aluminium is not attacked by an aqueous solution of alum, or by one of chloride of sodium, but a mixture of the two dissolves it with an evolution of hydrogen, aud this proves that chloride of aluminium is contained in the mixture.
Wheatstone long since showed that aluminium was as strongly electro-negative as platinum.
Its sonorous qualities are very great, like tlaat of crystal.
Various are the uses which can be made of the aluminium and of its alloys with silver and copper.
All the purposes for which it could be advantageously employed in virtue of its peculiar properties, of not tarnishing by exposure to atmospheric agencies, aud its lightness combined with its extraordinary strength, 1857.]
would be far too tedious to enumerate.
A few instances only will suffice of its adaptability for philosophical apparatus, for all articles for table, for service and ornament, for kitchen utensils, for the works of clocks and even watches, for trappings of harness, for plate and door knobs, keys, &c. Its sonorous qualities render it valuable for making bells.
In the galvano-plastic arts it replaces platinum.
Aluminium is most easily soldered with its own alloys.
The alloys most convenient are those with silver, zinc or tin, their point of fusion being below that of aluminium.
The soldering may be done by means of a spirit lamp, and without any previous cleaning.
Pure aluminium can be easily distinguished from impure by its greater whiteness, its indistinct traces of crystallization ; occasionally one or two welldefined hexagons can be recognized on the surface of the ingots.
The impure has a bluish tint like zinc, and if the entire surface is not crystalline, the upper surface is always more so than in pure aluminium; the form of the crystals is also quite different.
In giving the theoretical proportion of material employed in the manufacture of aluminium, the relative cheapness of its production, its properties and strength when comparing it bulk for bulk with other metals, it is desired to demonstrate its valuable properties and uses, also to guard against the fictitious reports so current of its excessive cheapness.
Note.
— The experiment of Sir H. Davy should be mentioned in the early production of this metal ; he endeavored to produce it by passing the vapor of potassium over alumina at a white heat ; he obtained only small grey particles interspersed with aluminate of potash.

A letter was read from Rev.
E. J. Lowe, dated Observatory, Beeston, near Nottingham, (England,) Jan. 7th, 1857, containing the following passage : — "The late Mr. Lawson, F. R. S., left rae his valuable collection of Meteorological Instruments, amongst which are Dr. Benjamin Franklin's Hygrometer, which is in as good working order as on the day it was made, an Electric Kite belonging to Dr. Franklin, and several letters.
Mr. Lawson had a card placed on the hygrometer, with the following inscription, ' Invented by and belonged to Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the Patriot of Philadelphia.'
I have mentioned this, thinking that you would feel an interest as American Philosophers in the information respecting the instruments of that glorious philosopher Dr. Franklin."

On the Crania of the Ancient Britons, with remarks on the people themselves.
By Joseph Barnard Davis.
Which were severally referred to Committees.
Mr. Lea made the following remarks on the visual organs of certain species of the genus Unio : He 'stated that he had at various times paid a good deal of attention to the habits and organs of the Naiades of our own country, and for that purpose frequently had them for long periods in a living state under his observation.
Their condition as to special sense has been of great interest, and particularly those of touch, hearing and sight.
In the course of these investigations, it became evident to him that some species of Unio were sensitive to light, and he found one species ( Unio radiatus) very eminently so.
He stated that he was not aware of its ever having been suggested that any of the family were possessed of organs of sight, even in a young state, as in the case of the young of Mytilus edulis.
It is well known that some of the Molluscs have large and perfect eyes, while some others have imperfect ones, but generally they are altogether devoid of the optic nerve.
The Sirombidce are said to possess an eye highly organised, but in most of the Gasteropoda it is of a more simple structure, and perhaps only possesses sensibility of light without the power of distinct vision.
The terrestrial Gasteropoda have usually a distinct eyeball on the extremity of the superior tentacula, which Dr. Leidy has shown, in some of our species of Helices, to possess a crystalline lens and choroidea, with clear, consistent, vitreous humor.
Cuvier and Lamarck considered the whole class of Conchifera to be devoid of eyes, but Poll has shown that in Fecten varius, Lin., the margin of the mantle is furnished with numerous eyes.
These, according to Carpenter, are protected by a sclerotic coat with a transparent cornea in front, a layer of pigment, a crystalline lens and vitreous body, and a retinal expansion proceeding from an optic nerve.
In the course of his observations, Mr. Lea became satisfied that the closing of the siphonal tubes, on his approach to the specimens he had in his vivarium, was not altogether occasioned by the vibration caused by his approach, and he accordingly arranged numerous individuals of several species with a view carefully to observe them.
In the course of these e.xaminations repeatedly made, he found several species of Unio quite sensitive to his passing his hand between them and the light, while the Margaritana margarttifera, and 1857.]
2 Anodonta undulata and A. lacustris, Lea, showed no signs of sensitiveness.
Unio ■inflalus exhibited but little motion, while numerous specimens of U. radiatus invariably gave more or less sign when the interruption of light took place.
Some individuals were more sensitive than others, and the females exhibited this power much more than the males, often withdrawing, not only their siphons, but their mantle within the valves.
It is difficult to say with certainty how far their visual organs are developed, as well also as to number and exact position.
The fringes of the branchial and and anal siphons are, in the Uniones, formed of small, subconical tentacula.
These are larger in the branchial siphon of Unio, while they do not exist at all in the anal opening of Anodonta;.
With a good lens the terminal point of the tentacula may be observed to be rounded and furnished with at least the appearance of an eye, and that it will prove to be a true eye, however imperfect, there can be but little doubt.
Mr. Lea did not intend to pursue the minute anatomy of this organ ; he left it to Dr. Leidy, who had done so much in the histology of the terrestrial Gasteropods, believing that he would be able to make out the complete anatomy of the eye in the U7iio.

Dr. Leidy made the following observations on entozoa found in the Naiades.
He had observed a curious parasite allied to Aspidogaster conchicola, infesting Anodonta fiuviatilis and Anodonta lacustris, within the cleft of the upper branchial cavity, adhering to the outer surface of the renal organ and the contiguous margin of the foot.
The new parasite, for which the name of Cotylaspis insignis was proposed, is from ^ aline to 1 line long, curved funnel shaped, with the base forming an oval ventral disk provided with an outer circle and an inner row of acetabula 29 in number.
The animal is provided with distinct eyes, while Aspidogaster, in accordance with its being imprisoned in the pericardium of the Naiades, is blind.

[Feb. Catalogue of Birds collected on the Eiver Muni, Western Africa, by Mr. P. B DbChaillu in 1856, with notes and descriptions of new species.
BY JOHN CASSIN.
The collection of birds, of which the succeeding is a catalogue, was made by Mr. DuChaillu during a journey up the River Aluni, made with the hope of being able to reach the supposed source of the River Congo as laid down in recent maps.
In this, however, he did not succeed, being prevented by ranges of high mountains, and the fact that the nations of negroes at the extreme point attained by him were unwilling to allow any of their people to accompany him, and apparently knew nothing of the nations beyond those mountains.
He penetrated to a distance of 250 to 300 miles from the coast, and traced the Muni to its source. '
As at Cape Lopez, Mr. DuChaillu did not collect birds of which numerous specimens had formerly been sent in his collections from the Gaboon and from the Moondah.
This fact will account for the absence of some well known species from the present catalogue.
Mr. DuChaillu is at present about to undertake the ascent of the River Camma, lat.
about 1.30 S., again hoping to reach the Congo, and if successful will attempt its ascent to its source.
With this journey he will occupy the present year, and is amply provided with the necessary equipment for his arduous and perilous undertaking, through the liberality of gentlemen of this Academy.

This is a small straight billed species belonging to the same group as our T. noiaiiis and T. canicapillus, Hartlaub.
It may be easily distinguished by its straight bill and chestnut colored tail, both of which characters strongly mark all of the specimens now before me, through some are evidently not in adult plumage.
The present bird appears to be allied also to T. olivaeens, Swainson, and to T. icterinus, Temm.

PL Col. 88, not belonging to the same subgeneric group, and the description of T. icterinus, consisting as it does simply of a statement : " Similis Tr.
barbato, sed diiplo minor," is too careless and indefinite to be entitled to any consideration.

Andropadus virens, nobis.
Smaller than either A. gracilirostris, latirostris or imporiimvs, but most resembling the last.
Bill wide at base, rather short, cutting edge of the upper mandible distinctly crenated near tbe tip ; wing moderate, rounded, fourth and fifth quills longest and nearly equal ; tail rather short, with the feathers wide, plumage of the rump long, ample, soft ; feet moderate.
Total length, about 6 inches, wing 3, tail 2| inches.
Colors generally resembling those of ^.
i7}iportunus, but with the tail in the present species dark greenish brown.
Entire plumage above dark olive green, rather lighter on the rump ; upper tail coverts tinged with brown.
Under parts yellowish green, the yellow predominating on the middle of the abdomen and under tail coverts.
Inferior coverts of the wing light greenish yellow ; quills edged on their inner webs with yellowish white.
Tail greenish brown with the feathers slightly edged with yellowish green.
Bill dark ; legs light colored.
Hab.
Cape Lopez and River Muni, Western Africa.
Discovered by Mr. P. B. DuChaillu.
This is a smaller species than any hitherto known of this genus.
It resembles in general appearance .4. importunus, but can at once be distinguished by its smaller size and the more decided brown color of its tail, in which character it is more like the other two species mentioned above.
This bird and A. gracilirostris and latirostris are evidently abundant species of Equatorial Western Africa, numerous specimens of each being in the collections of Mr. DuChaillu.

A second specimen of this curious little bird is in the present collection.
It does not belong to the genus Pycnosphrys^ a specimen of the type of which is now in the Museum of the Academy.
The present bird has a strong and rather wide bill, numerous long bristles and a rather long tail.
In form only (not in color) it resembles the genus Tyrannula.
My leisure at present will not warrant an extended examination.

Not wishing nor ever intending to pursue science as a cold abstraction, nor as an object of selfish ambition, I have named many birds in commemoration of my friends, and hope to do so again.
For this I have the example of the greatest zoologists, and of none more conclusively than that of the greatfounder of modera systematic Zoology, who applied this description ofnames, especially to genera of plants, more extensively than any other naturalist has done in any department of Natural History.
By this token, I name the present beautiful bird after my loved and only daughter.
Should her pathway in the world be pleasant, may she know also the great gratification that comes from the pursuit of Natural History ; but if like her namesake of ancient days she shall go on her way weeping, may she have [Feb. for her comfort the conscience, patience and moral excellence of her mother, with whatever of the good of the character of her father those who know him best may accord to him !

On the Crania of the Ancient Britons, with Semarks on the People themselves.
BY JOSEPH BARNARD DAVIS.
It was the distinguished and excellent Professor Samuel George Morton, who, by his industry, skill and great attainments, mainly developed what may be denominated the science of Comparative Cranioscopy, as applied to ancient and extinct races of men.
And we deem it an especial honor to be permitted to address that learned body before which Morton's chief discoveries in this science were first announced — an Academy which had the surpassing advantage of numbering him among its Presidents.
But in venturing thus to address the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia upon a subject congenial to those so admirably illustrated by its late President, and therefore in some measure following in his steps, it must be distinctlj'' announced in limine^ that it is not with any pretensions whatever to co-equal powers, or co-equal learning.
The Ancient Britons, the aboriginal people of the British Isles, are a race of whose physical characters we can learn little or nothing from classical writers, whether Greek or Roman.
The very little knowledge to be acquired is only incidental, never direct — imparted as it were by accident.
They were a people divided into a number of tribes, living chiefly by the chase and the products of the rivers and the sea ; yet not devoid of both pastoral and agricultural habits.
They are known to us mainly from presenting a serious obstacle for ages to the arms of the conquerors of the world — imperfectly subdued with much difficulty, and only held in subjection by the most consummate stratagems of the military art of the Romans.
To account for their first appearance in the Islands, many ingenious and learned theories of immigration have been broached, all of which are exposed to a serious objection, independent of failing to suggest any reasonable motive for such primordial migration, viz : that they are based upon a point, instead of a broad and solid foundation — they invert the order of nature, and make use of the result and the superstructure to give the substratum which is required.
They all suppose man, in his most primitive and most helpless condition, to have been endowed and furnished with apjiliances and arts, which are only the result of development and cultivation.
And, like the similar fanciful speculations which would derive the Indian tribes of the American continent from the eastern one, are obnoxious to the objection of being gratuitous and superfluous.
Their inventors can give no valid reason, based on solid ethnological ground, why the assumed migrations may not have pursued a diametrically opposite course.
This being the case, we have a right to maintain, that there is a decided preponderance on either one side or the other, and an equal reason to assume for the primitive inhabitants of the British Islands an aboriginal and primordial character not inferior to that of any other race.
[Feb. Like most, if not all the primitive people, they have manifested the great principle inherent in the human mind, which incessantly animates an irrei)ressibly longing hope and aspiration for a future life — one of those elements of man, which more than any other bears irresistible evidence, both of his inherent grandeur and superiority in the animal scale, and also, of the strict unity and identity of his race — they have manifested this noble and sacred sentiment by a scrupulous and elaborate care in preserving the dead ; to whom they even furnished food, objects of adornment, weapons and companions also for the future life they anticipated beyond the tomb.
Their tombs, the Cromlechs, Barrows, Cairns of the British Islands, notwithstanding the lapse of twenty, thirty or more centuries, have remained until recent times scattered over the surface of the country in various directions; and, it is evident, have been constructed with such pains and skill as to have braved all the chances and changes of revolving ages, until the arts of modern agriculture, or the inquisitive hand of man — alas !
almost constantly a rude, uninstructc^d and ruthless hand — have unhearsed the remains they have so faithfully preserved.
These remains, which, as Sir Thomas Browne long since said, " have quietly rested under the drums and tramplings of three conquests," are capable of teaching us something of the race to which they have belonged, andof recnlling some of those physical features of which it is so unfortunate the ancients left no full, faithful and permanent record, when they had the living people before them.
If we might not have expected from the martial spirit of Caesar an ethnography of the tribes who proved such stubborn obstacles to his ambition and desire of conquest, there were those among his friends, who passed over and remained with him in Britain, who had both the abilities and the opportunities to accomplish this task.
The most illustrious of Roman orators, as we learn from his invaluable Epistles, writing to his brother Quintus, who was one of Ca.
'sars companions in Britain, and even entertained the design, urges upon him the composition of the work which we must ever lament the want of — a Poem on the geography, the natural history, the ethnography — " mores et gentes," the nations or tribes, and their manners and customs — as well as the history of the war in which the great Roman general had been engaged with them.
It were in vain to lament the want of the curious information this work would have imparted.
We are now mainly reduced to the teachings of the tomb, and in the language of M. L'Abbe Cochet, a learned French archicologist, " dans le silence de I'histoire, le tombe est le meilleur document que Ton puisse consulter pour connaitre la vie, les mreurs, et la religion de nos peres."
The eleven fine lithographs of the skulls of the ancient Britons, which I transmit to the Academy with this paper, have been executed from the crania themselves of the natural size, and with the greatest care and fidelity.
They are derived from Barrows in parts of England at considerable distances from each other, — some from Yorkshire, which was inhabited by the tribe of the Brigantes in the time of Ptolemy, about the year 120 of the Christian era, — some from Derbyshire and Staflbrdsbire, the seats of the Coritani and Cornavii at the same period, — one from Gloucestershire, the seat of the Dobuni, — and others from Wiltshire, the country of the Atrebaiii in the days of Ptolemy.
We cannot affirm that they have actually belonged to individuals of these tribes respectively, as there are many chances which might render this doubtful.
Wars, whether intestine or foreign, and migrations, no doubt did their work of mutation in that early time as they have done since ; and there is also the possibility, although very remote, of their having belonged to prisoners, or to guests of neighboring or remote tribes.
But in the absence of all evidence to support these suppositions, we cannot err much in appropriating them to the tribes in whose country they were found.
At least, there can be no question of their genuine Britannia origin and derivation.
This, as we shall perceive on closer examination is impressed on every feature, and is now almost as cognizable as in the day in which they were clothed with their fleshly lineaments.
The study of skulls in general teaches us that among all races, although there is a general resemblance running through the series belonging to a given race, 1857.]
yet there are many minor diversities ; and it is probable that among European races these diversities have a wider range than in the other great divisions of the human family.
Morton was able to discern among all the numerous American races, exclusive of his hyperborean, a family resemblance.
Notwithstanding this position of his, we must admit that the diversities of the cranial forms of the very numerous and diverse tribes of the American continent are both great and frequent; and an extended study would in all probability develope such resemblances in specific families as would confer upon them a distinct and proper value.
Now among such specific families belonging to European races we believe it is much the same, only that the individual peculiarities in the families diverge further from the tribal type of form, and are probably more frequent.
Under these circumstances, we are prepared to expect diversity of form among the crania of the ancient IBritons ; but it is not unreasonable also to expect that, true to the beautiful principle of nature, of an endless diversity under a comprehensive uniformity, this diversity will be restrained within limits, and be subjected to definite rules.
We may therefore endeavor to distinguish what may be denominated the typical form of cranium belonging to any race of man, and then to arrange the divergent forms subordinately around this.
I.
We believe the iijpical form of cranium of the ancient Briton may be regarded as represented by some of the skulls delineated in these lithographs, especially in that from the Barrow on Ballidon Moor in Derbyshire, and that from Green Gate Hill Barrow in Yorkshire, and that from Codford iu Wiltshire, plates 1, 3, 4 of the 1st decade of Crania Britannica.
They are somewhat short or brac/u/-ccphalic, not ill-developed, nor remarkable for a small facial angle.
The bones of the face, and especially the upper maxillaries, are upright, or orthognathous, but, also rather short ; and they present, more than the bones of the calvariunl that rugged aspect which is the characteristic of a savage or semi-civilized race.
The chin is usually prominent, the external surface of the upper maxillaries depressed, the nose abrupt and short, surmounted with a frowning eminence marking the situation of the frontal sinuses.
The teeth are tolerably large and usually well worn.
They correspond with the rugged and frequently everted angle of the lower jaw, the spacious zygomatic arch, and the large surface, well marked out by its superior semi-circular line on the sides of the calvarium.
These rough and spacious surfaces indicate power in the temporal and masseter muscles, and equally with the condition of the teeth, reveal a people of carnivorous tastes, a peojile whose delight was in the chase, and the luscious feasts it afforded them.
II.
Of the aberrant forms of the ancient British skull one is remarkable for its length, and may be denominated doUcho-cephalic.
To this form there attaches a good deal of interest, from the theories which learned men have been induced to associate with it.
An example of this peculiar aberration is afforded by the cranium from the famous chambered Barrow of Uleybury in Gloucestershire, plate 5 of Cran.
Brit.
This skull is remarkable for its length and want of elevation, but it is not particularly distinguished by narrowness.
Other examples of the dolicho-cephalic form of the ancient British cranium are known to the writer, but some of these are quite as much marked by their want of breadth as by their elongation.
In fact, they equal in this feature the skulls of that race to which longness and narrowness of cranium are regarded as peculiarly appropriated — the negroes of Africa.
It is a singular circumstance that these long skulls of ancient Britons have usually been met with in a particular species of Barrow, that which is composed of a series of chambers, arranged it may be in diverse manners — the chambered Barrow.
In the anxious inquiries in which the mind is apt to indulge when prying into the almost impenetrable obscurity of a very remote past, every special circumstance fixes the attention and acquires importance.
And the discoveries we have mentioned have led to the theory that these long crania have belonged to a particular precedent race of people, a people who interred their dead in a more elaborate and complex manner than the race which succeeded them ; a race of people which have been distinguished by the denomination oipre-Celtic.
In the LFeb.
opinion of the writer the evidence is much too incomplete for any such inference as this, were it not equally obnoxious to the objection mentioned in the early part of our rcniurks — that of a certain inversion in the order of sequence — by representing the complex barrow builders as jjreceding those who raised simple barrows, which is contrary to all experience.
There arc good archaeological reasons, it is true, for believing that the chambered Barrows of Great Britain belong to what is denominated " the stone period," and that they are very early, but that the builders of them can with any good confidence be referred to the earliest portion of the stone period, seems to us to want [jrobability as much as it wants conclusive evidence for its suj)port.
The circumstance that these long skulls have usually been found in chambered Barrows may be a mere contingency, little more than accidental, and further inquiry may not improbably prove this.
For it must not be supposed that the skulls of ancient Britons are numerous, or have often been saved from the wreck of their primeval sepulchres, and especially that many of the dolicho-cephalic crania from Barrows of a chambered character have been met with.
Strangers to the facts of the case might have supposed both these things to be true, but indeed they are far from being so.
Specimens of crania of ancient Britons are rare objects, those in anything like a perfect state, very rare, and all specimens are becoming rarer every day.
British Barrows have been undergoing destructiou for ages, having been the prey of idle curiosity or cupidity always, and the skulls of those once so sacredly enhearsed in them by the tender hands of mourning friends and relations have always been especially exposed to destruction, possibly from the feeling of ignorant terror, which is so apt to diverge into ferocity and destriictiveness.
But whatever be the cause, the fact receives daily confirmation that when ancient tombs are accidently opened by uninstructed and unscientific persons, the relics are plundered and the fragile bony remains are at once violently broken into fragments.
Therefore objects such as those with which our attention is occupied are not numerous, and have not received that notice to which they are entitled.
But to return to the dolicho-cephalic crania of the chambered Barrows, supposed to indicate a " pre-Celtic race," and upon which has chiefly been built the mighty doctrine — certainly mighty for such a meagre foundation — that an entire race of a distinct peo])le, in some verj'^ remote period of antiquity, migrated to the shores of the British islands and invaded them, established themselves therein and dwelt there for ages.
In some cases the evidence for this vast hypothesis — countenanced by ethnologists of the greatest learning, men well meriting the high reputation they enjoy — maj' be explained in a much simpler way.
In a Derbyshire Barrow, called Long Lowe, three crania of this type occurred, which we are strongly inclined to regard as having a family relation, and as exhibiting a mere family peculiarity.
One a long flat skull of beautiful outline, is that of a man, aged about 40 years ; another, that of a woman somewhat older ; and the third, of a girl under 10 years of age, who may be concluded to have been the daughter of the two above named p;vrents.
Another of the Derbyshire chambered Barrows, which has been ])roductive of dolicho-cephalic crania, is situated u[)on " Five Wells Hill," and is unquestionably of vast antiquity ; but we possess a skull from among the lowest interments in this Barrow, which is of brachy-cephalic form, and the existence of which, in the position in which it was found, we cannot help thinking shakes the theory of the dolicho-cephalic pre-Celtic race to its very foundations.
In fine, we may remark, that we see no sufficient ground for admitting a favorite hypothesisofthepresent day, that another race of people preceded the ancient Britons ; which kind of doctrine has not been confined to the British isles, but took its rise in Denmark and Norway, where it has received its chief attention and illustration, although it should be mentioned, that the order of precedency has been inverted there, and the brachy-cephalic, not the dolicho-cephalic people, have been supposed to have come first.
III.
The next important aberrant form is one that is remarkable for horizontal expansion, and which we have denominated plaiy -cephalic.
The cranium is not deficient in longitude, but does not impress the eye by its length on ac1857. count of being equally expanded in breadth.
It forms a skull of considerable capacity, and is well exhibited in the cranium from the Western Hill Barrow, No.
6, although not very apparent in the lithograph of the profile.
IV.
These are the chief aberrant forms.
It is probable there may be another distinguished by the extreme elevation of the vertex, to which the name of aero-cephalic is applicable.
It is not unlikely that the skull from the Barrow at Kennet, near the famous avenue and megalithic circle of Avebury in Wiltshire, in the lithograph No.
9, is an instance.
Its extraordinary facial form we fear is partly to be attributed to some distortion arising from an imperfect restoration from the fragments to which it was reduced when found.
From the remarks now made, it will be seen that our investigations are far from giving countenance to a doctrine, announced by a very respectable authority, that in primeval times the skulls of mankind were much more alike than in the present day, that they were, as it may be said, "stereotyped" in one mould.
So far from this we believe it may be proved in this field, as in all others, that diversity within certain definite limits has been the beautiful law of nature from the first.
In stature we have reason to know the ancient Britons varied a good deal.
A famous skeleton of a British chieftain, discovered in a coffin made out of the trunk of a tree, in 1834, at Gristhorpe, near Scarborough, and now preserved in the Museum of that town, measured 6 feet 2 inches in height.
Another skeleton, also from the North Riding of Yorkshire, in the rich Museum of British antiquities of Mr. Bateman, of Youlgrave, in Derbyshire, measures only 5 feet 3 inches in height.
Whilst that of a British woman in the same Museum, from a Derbyshire Barrow called " Wagon Lowe," near Buxton, measures 5 feet 5| inches in height.
No one has labored so earnestly, so diligently, and with so much pains and care as the late Professor Morton to bring the test of the measurement of crania of various races to tlie elucidation of different obscure problems of anthropological science.
It becomes us, therefore, to explain what little information we have been able to collect upon this subject.
At present it is but little, still in the course of another year or two we trust to make it much more complete.
In bringing our present imperfect evidence before the Academy, we hope to be excused for remarking, that we are not inclined to expect quite so much or quite such conclusive information from the determination of the capacities of crania as Morton did.
And we are satisfied that a much more extended observation, upon a more defined basis than he adopted, is requisite to develope data of a reliable character as to the relative capacities of difi'erent series of skulls.
One great source of error will require to be eliminated, arising from taking any series of crania above a certain age, provided they are not idiots, indiscriminately^ and without regard to the relative numbers of the different sexes.
For instance, from the remarkable and well known difference in the size of the skulls of men and of women of the same race, if we have an equal number of crania of two races to compare together, the one series containing a greater number of those of women than the other, the whole calculation will be vitiated.
But without dwelling further upon tlaese questions at present, we will give, in a tabular form, the internal capacities of a few ancient British crania, merely explaining that they are all those of men, and are taken with dry sand by weight.
In order, however, to render them as far as possible available for comparison witli Morton's great table laid before the Academy in the year 1849, and published in the "Proceedings" for that year, we have converted them into the denomination of cubic inches employed by him, and arranged the figures exactly as he did.
Number of Ancient British skulls of men 11.
Largest internal capacity 110-15 cubic inches.
Smallest do.
87-7 " Mean do.
98-6 " These results do not admit a strict comparison with the table of Morton, on the ground already stated, that the British skulls have belonged to men exclusively.
Still we shall be safe in comparing Morton's largest internal ca])acity [Feb. with ours of 110-15 cubic inches, for, no doubt, both were derived from the skulls of men.
The largest internal capacity in his whole table, 114 cubic inches, was found in the skull of a Dutchman, who was born at Utrecht and died in Java.
In fact, it is the largest cranium in the grand Mortoniau collection.
A skull of an ancient Briton found in Green Lowe, in Derbyshire, which has probably belonged to a Ooritanian, has a capacity of 110-15 cubic inches, or within 4 cubic inches of the same size.
The largest of Morton's English skulls had an internal capacity of lOG cubic inches, or 5-15 cubic inches less than the Green Lowe Barrow cranium.
And the largest of Morton's AngloAmerican skulls was no less than 13 cubic inches Ic-ss than this from the Green Lowe Barrow in internal capacity.
From this small and imperfect amount of evidence we appear to be justified in concluding that the crania of the Ancient Britons were by no means deficient in internal or cerebral capacity.
Much more numerous observations arc, however, required before any data can be deduced on this subject, of a nature as satisfactory as the evidence will admit.
It may not be impertinent to mention here, parenthetically, that the skull of largest internal capacity we have met with, is au ancient Iri>sh calvarium, found in 1855 at a depth of 10 feet in Suffolk street in Dublin; of course the term ancient in this place must be taken conditionally, as applying probably to medieval and not to pnmeval times.
The internal capacity of this calvarium is notless than 123-5 cubic inches, or very nearly 10 cubic inches more than that of the Dutchman of noble birth in the i\[ortonian Collection.
An assertion is frequently made by the advocates of the progressive development and improvement of all races, which it may not be improper to allude to here.
They maintain that the influence of what is denominated civilization is able to develope the brain of any race materially in the course of ages, and consequently its osseous case.
This doctrine of development is distinct from that which affirms that different races of men are distinguished by crania of different capacities ; on the contrary, it supposes that all races may, by a process of civilization and development attain to a large capacity of the skull and corresponding great brain.
As far as the observations of ancient British.
crania we have previously mentioned, they do not give any countenance to this theory of development.
And, we may add, that our further observations, although neither so numerous nor so extensive as they ought to be, and as we hope to make them, on ancient Roman and on Anglo-Saxon skulls, are equally far from rendering this doctrine support.
Of the hitherto few skulls already engraved in the " Crania Britannica," we may refer to one ancient Roman skull derived from the city of York, the Roman "Eburacum."
The internal capacity of this cranium amounts to no less than 104-7 cubic inches.
Another fine cranium of an AngloSaxon derived from an ancient cemetery in Cambridgeshire, has an internal capacity of no less than 109-6 cubic inches.
As far, therefore, as these data go, they give no countenance to the assumption that, as races proceed in their advancement from the state of barbarism upwards, their brains gradually expand.
With the capability of all races to make this advance, another assumption that is usually associated with the former, we have nothing to do at present.
It would be quite unnecessary to remark upon the permanency of cranial forms before an Academy presided over by Morton, any more than to dwell upon primitive diversity, which has already been alluded to.
But the series of sknlls to which the attention of the Academy has been solicited, afford additional evidence which bears upon these points.
And an attentive consideration of ancient skulls will develope a series of remarkable diversities.
Professor Morton, in his elaborate and well-reasoned work, " Crania ^gyptica," which stands in so near a relationship to this Academy, has pointed out in the most masterly manner the characteristics of the cranium of the ancient Egyptians.
That delicate cranial form was proper to them, whom Morton ultimately concluded to be indigenous to the valley of the Nile, and strictly aborignes.
It was we, believe, deserving of the epithet idiogeneous, or especially proper to the race, and had a relation to them alone, and to no other race, ancient or modern.
There is a peculiarity in the generality of the mummified 1857.]
heads of the ancient Egyptians, well seen in the skulls also, ■which Morton has not expressly mentioned, but which always strikes us at the first glance.
Like all ocular impressions, it is more readily perceived than described.
But it arises from the particular outlines by which the profile of the cranium is circumscribed.
The base line, the most essential feature, runs along the whole of the base of the lower jaw from the tip of the pointed chin, and passing thence directly to and along all the external centre of the occipital bone as far as its tuberosity.
This base line may be seen to be totally at variance with the line which bounds the ancient British skull in the same direction from the profiles before the Academy.
"We believe it is only found in crania of an African lineage, and in none so level and uniform as in those of the ancient Egyptians.
If we let down upon this base a facial line, which shall run along the forehead, and, with only a slight deviation, till it runs also along the forepart of the pointed chin, we thus bound the cranium in these two directions by right lines, which meet at a more acute angle than in any other race.
They are strictly Egyptian in their character, for in the negro races this facial line has no proper commencement from the receding forehead, and is seriously interrupted by the prognathous jaws and teeth.
It is the form we have thus endeavored to analyse and describe which imparts to the ancient Egyptian skull its delicate and elegant character.
How diverse is the robust erect form of the ancient British skull, marked by great depressions of the facial surfsice, and instead of the graceful long nasal bones, abrupt and short ones, standing immediately below the frowning frontal protuberance, with the intervening hiatus.
All which features impress the mind with feelings of a much less complacent kind, and inevitably lead to the conviction that we have before us the representation of a bold uncivilized nature — full of power, and not deficient in capacity, but quite incapable of refinement and the graces of cultivation.
These Egyptian and British cranial forms are strikingly at variance, although probably owning an equal antiquity — indeed we see no good reason whatever, why these different people may not have been primeval contemporaries ; and yet the marks of diversity they present are as clear and sharp as any that can be adduced among any modern people.
They point, therefore, in an irresistible manner to a primordial difference.
The ancient Britons themselves, it is probable, may be regarded as an idiogeneoiis race, i. e., taken as a whole proper in their characters, physical and moral, and distinct from all others.
Whether the ancient Gauls resembled them in all particulars, seems very doubtful.
They admit of comparison with other people of ancient and modern times, but we are inclined to think, were we able to realize a faithful and complete picture of them, it would present irreconcilable discrepancies with other races.
They had many marks of agreement with the Indian Tribes of North Amei'ica.
They dwelt in a temperate region, where animal and vegetable life was abundant, and devoted themselves to the chase, in which they were assisted by the aborignal hounds of Britain.
Claudian, in his allusion to these dogs, represents them as capable of overcoming bulls.
hfe pedibus celeres : has nare sagaces.
Hirsutaeque fremunt Cressffi, tenuesque Lacaenae, Magnaque taurorum fracturas colla Britannae.
The Britons were equally possessed of the small indigenous horse of the country.
They also found in the native forests animals of chase of equal, nay greater, magnitude than that of the Buifalo of the prairie, and, we have reason to think, were as successful as the Indians of the northern part of this continent in their pursuit of them.
A Barrow opened in the parish of Cherhill near Calne in Wiltshire, in 1833, revealed a number of bones, and among them were the enormous horns of an ox, the horn-cores of which had a circumference of 15J inches at the root, and in their widest expansion, a diameter of 33 inches.
Besides this collossal ox they had other bovine cattle, and deer, of the hunting of which with hounds the Romano-British pottery aS'ords numerous pictures, as it seems to have been a favorite subject with the artists for the Samian ware.
It appears at first view an astonishing circumstance that the weapons of chase, [Feb. the arms and implements of the ancient Britons should be almost identical with those of the ancient race of Indians of this continent.
The same siiear-heads, arrow-heads, axes, &c., of the earlier North American Indians are of the same forms as those of the ancient Britains, and they differ only in material.
Instead of the constantly occurring flint of the Britons, the North American tribes have used flint more sparingly, and a series of other hard and beautiful stones, sueh as chalcedony, jasper, crystal, &c., for the production of these weapons.
To the kinduess of Mr. Franklin Peale, a highly esteemed Member of this Academy, the writer is indebted for a very fine collection of the stone implements and weapons of the North American Indians, Avhich excited surprise to find them so closely approximating to those of the ancient Britons.
The truth is the resemblance now alluded to seems to be confined by no limits of latitude or longitude.
The stone weapons and implements from Japan in SiebokVs Museum at Leyden we found to be scarcely distinguishable from the British ; and we have also seen flint spear-heads from New Zealand, not only closely api>roximating the ancient British ones, but actually fashioned with the same number of strokes, given in the self same direction.
In accordance with the prevailing views on the origin and distribution of man, this extraordinary similarity in the stone weapons and other utensils of such widely distributed races has been ascribed to the distribution of the makers, and the communication of the art.
An hypothesis, we believe, out of the limits of possibility by any natural means of difl'usion.
Whereas, the simple circumstance that these weapons are all produced by beings of similar jiowers and capacities, having similar wants, and similar objects wherewith to satisfy those wants, is an adequate explanation of the phenomenon ; and according to all right principles of philosophy should be admitted at once.
That the ancient Britons adopted the flexed or crouching posture in the interment of the dead, just as the Indian races of America, we have abundant evidence.
This again is a practice generally diffused among all uncivilized races, the aborigines of Australia adopting it, as well as others.
There need be no question also, that it is to be referred to some common cause operating on all alike ; very probably to a desire to imitate that posture which is both easy and agreeable to them, in the hut or around the fire, and associated in their minds with the most pleasing recollections of life ; therefore fittest in which to renew life, and to begin again the social intercourse and delights of another world beyond the tomb.
For it should never be forgotten that savages, as we call them, are not brutes, but richly endowed with all the sentiments of the human mind, and animated by its highest aspirations.
How far the ancient Britons advanced in that general development which we call civilization, it is difficult to ascertain.
That the more southern tribes, especially, received from the Phoenician traders, implements and weapons of bronze, and learned the art of manufacturing such themselves, is now pretty satisfactorily determined ; although it is very questionable whether these superseded the earlier stone ones wholly anywhere, but especially in the remote districts of the country.
Their fate was by a succession of imperial armies to be kept in check, to be subjected to a succession of conquests, and ultimately to be in large part reduced to -slavery, whether in their native regions, or in Italy and in the other dependencies of the empire.
Those who can lay claim by descent to the nearest relation to the aborigines of the British Islands are still a peculiar people, marked in every feature of their characters by traits which distinguish them from the races of other blood with whom they have been for so many ages in contact.
Thus proving that the lineaments of nature cannot be effaced by all the chances and changes of time.
We have now gone over the subject proposed to be discussed — perhaps in a somewhat too long and discursive manner, with a view of rendering it more easy to be understood by those to whom it is probably not very familiar — as fiir as it seems desirable at the present time.
And it only remains for the writer to express his appreciation of the mark of honor conferred upon him by this learned Academy in allowing him to address them, and more especially in per1857.]
mitting him to do so in the character of a Corresponding Member.
However inadequate to make a due return for such a distinction, it will always be his pleasure and his ambition to place his poor attainments at the service of the Academy.

We therefore consider these two specimens as belonging to a new and undescribed species, with the following characters: — Gerrhosaurus nigro-lineatus.
Char.
Eight rows of ventral scutes; six superior labials ; body slender; tail long, two yellowish vittae, one on each side of the back, commencing at the occiput and lost upon the tail; within each vitta a black band running the whole length of the back ; the interspace marked with black spots assuming more or less the form of longitudinal lines well marked upon the tail ; flanks, in the young white spotted, under parts yellowish.
Description.
The body is slender, covered above and upon the sides with twenty-five longitudinal rows of carinated scales; the interspace between these and the ventral scutes occupied with six rows of granulations ; tail long and tapering, cyclo-tetragonal at base ; the rostral plate presents an acute angle above, and articulates on either side with the first labial and the naso-rostral ; the nostril opens between three plates, the naso-rostral, the naso-frenal and the first labial ; the naso-rostral are well developed, in contact, with a convex anterior margin, the internal quite short, the posterior concave, where they articulate with the inter-nasal ; the naso-frenal are in contact inferiorly with the first supra-labial, above with the inter-nasal ; the inter-nasal is a large plate, more extended laterally than longitudinally, its inferior and lateral margin in contact with the first frenal ; the fronto-nasals are tw'o in number and in contact ; the frontal is hexagonal, longer than broad, more narrow posteriorly, its lateral margins excavated ; there are two fronto-parietals, a little larger than the frontonasals, and like them pentagonal ; there are two large parietals, with a small inter-parietal, broader anteriorly; the second frenal is much larger than the first ; there are two small freno-orbitars, the first longer than the second ; there are four supra-orbitars, with a longitudinal row of as many plates beneath them, and there are six supra-labials ; the posterior geneials are considerably larger than the anterior ; the mental is broader than long ; there are eight longitudinal rows of quadrangular ventral scutes, more or less striated, and fourteen anal pores on each side ; the preanal scales are five in number, the lateral ones the most developed ; scales upon outer surface of thighs, legs and forearms strongly carinated ; there are thirteen transverse rows of scales between the occiput and the anterior extremity; the total number between the occiput and the posterior extremity fifty-one; one hundred and eleven verlicillas upon the tail ; auricular opening triangular, with a large scale in front; eight scales upon right temple, nine on left, in three rows, the posterior of the middle row the largest.

The length of this specimen is 1 ft. 2} inches ; of tail 1 inch 4 lines.
A very singular looking animal.
The contrast between the narrow mosaic looking quadrangular scutes upon the back, and the two longitudinal rows of broader ones is quite striking; the tail is short and rounded at its posterior extremity, which is protected by a circular mammelonated shield.
The figure of the plate in the wood-cut of the nostrils in the volume of the Proceedings referred to, does not appear to be accurate, this plate being more extended longitudinally, reaching to the extreme end of the rostral, where it is quite narrow terminating almost in a point.
The single lateral pore on each side of the preanal scutes is very distinct and is no doubt a constant character.
This species appears to be allied to the Cephalopeltis Cuvierii of Miiller, which has two plates upon the top of the head, (Zeitschriftfur Physiologie, von F. Tiedemann, G. R. & L. C. Treviranus, Vierter Band.

5, a, b, c. Dr. Smith in speaking of Monopeltis capensis observes, that although I have put forward this species as a type of the group, I doubt if its more extended observation will justify the proceeding.
It may prove to be only a very aberrant species of Lepidosternon, and if so Cephalopeltis Cuvieri, Miiller, will be a species of the same group, only a degree less removed from the typical form.
The most marked difference between the species in question and Lepidosternon macrocephalum, Wagl., consists in the covering of the head ; in the latter it is formed of many plates, in Cephalopeltis of two only, and in Monopeltis of one.

In a specimen from Liberia, the white stripe extends about half way along the side of the body, but it is more extended on the opposite side, and in all the specimens from the Gaboon there are two white vittae on each side, the lower one commencing in front of the eye and terminating at the posterior extremity ; the upper one beginning at the occiput and reaching as far as the root of the tail, the lower band the broader of the two ; four narrow black lines along the back, two on each side, becoming lost upon the root of the tail where they assume more the form of spots ; the row of white spots passing along the side of the neck and body as far as the extremity of the tail mentioned in the former description, is no doubt identical with the upper lateral vitta; under surface immaculate.
I do not observe that the inter-parietal is larger than either of the fronto-parietals in any of the specimens; in the one from Liberia it is longer.

This specimen measures 8 inches and 8 lines in extent, the tail 2 inches 10 lines, circumference 1 inch 3 lines.
There are twenty-two transverse rows of scales, and one hundred and seventy-three longitudinal, including fifty-six upon the tail ; there are no eyelids, but the eye may be distinguished situated near the middle of a scale at its anterior margin.
The Typhline of Cuvier, from the Cape of Good Hope, the only species of Typhline described by Dumeril and Bibron and by Mr. Gray, is represented by the former to be without other cephalic plates than that which encloses the whole face, as in a sort of case, (etui,) Mr. Gray, however, mentions 1857].
an internasal, a frontal, an interparietal and two parietals, but in both descriptions the preanal scale is represented as single.
The scales upon the head, as given by Mr. Gray, are very different from those of the genus under consideration, the characters of which approach nearest perhaps to those of Feylinia, Gray, Cat.
Lizards of British Museum, p. 129, in which the preanal scales are numerous.
Feylinia is characterized as having a moderate rostral, no eyes, with scales in front of the vent like those of the belly, and a tapering tail, a description which does not represent our animal.
The scales upon the back appear to be somewhat larger than those upon the sides ; those upon the abdomen and under part of tail are very finely striated, upon the back also, but the striations are less distinct.
Should no generic name have been previously given to this Scincoid, we would propose that of SpUenorhina.

Remarks.
Dendrophis Chenonii, Reinhardt, appears to be a different serpent ; the anterior frontals in the figure of that species (Reinhardt, nye Slangenarter, fig.
13,)* are quite small ; in L. smaragdinus their internal margin is much larger than that of the posterior, the reverse is the case in D. Chenonii.
L. smaragdinus is now one of the best determined species first described in print, and very accurately, by Prof. Schlegel.
Among the specimens sent by Dr. Ford is an arboricole serpent, having a general resemblance to Leptophis smaragdinus, but which, on a careful examination, differs so much in its characters from those of Leptophis, that we do not hesitate to make it a distinct genus, and for the following reasons : The head is more robust and not so long, the anterior frontals are smaller comparatively, the vertical is shorter, as are also the occipitals ; indeed, all the plates upon the *Beskrivelse Af Nogle nye Slangenarter ved J.

[Feb. top of the head, although having a general resemblance, differ in fact from the corresponding plates of smaragdinus ; the nostril, instead of being between two nasal plates, (the naso-rostral and naso-frenal,) is situated between the nasorostral and the frenal, which, however, may be accidental ; the frenal plate is considerably less narrow ; the eyes, instead of being oval, as in smaragdinus, are round or subround, and much more prominent ; the temporal plates are five in number, in two longitudinal rows, three in the inferior and two above ; in smaragdinus there are four, two below and two above ; in another, younger specimen, four on one side, three on the other, but differently arranged ; the number of superior labials is the same in each, viz., nine, the fifth and sixth immediately beneath the eye; but the shape of these plates diflVrs in the two animals, no two being alike; the posterior and superior angle of tne sixth in smaragdinus is much more prolonr;ed upward and backward, and the seventh is much larger ; the middle labial and the accessory labials differ in form, but the difference most to be remarked is between the posterior geneials, which in smaragdinus are very long and comparatively slender ; the scales in the one snake are long, narrow, and strongly carinated, in the other perfectly smooth, much less narrow and quadrangular, and there is a difference of three and a half inches in the length of the tail.
It may be interesting to compare this serpent with Herpetodryas aestivus and Dryophylax viridissimus, two slender green serpents, the one from Surinam, the other from the United Slates.
Herpetodryas astivus and Chlorophis heterodermus are of nearly the same length, there being a difference of about 7 lines ; but the difference between the tails is greater, that of iestivus being, in the specimen examined, 1 inch 81 lines longer ; but how marked is the difference in the shape of the frontal plate ; the nostrils in Herpetodryas open in a single plate, and although in both there are but one preocular and two postoculars, they are altogether different in form ; in the one the eye rests upon the fifth and sixth supra-labials, in the other (Herpetodryas) upon the fourth and fifth.
The arrangement and number of the temporal plates is difl'erent; in Dryophylax, which is a much stouter and longer serpent, the frontal plate differs from either of the others, the prefrontals pass down upon the side of the head as far as the supra-labials, the preand postoculars, although the same in number, still differ in shape, the position of the nostril is different, being between two plates, the eye rests on the fourth and fifth supra-labial plates, and the size of the eye differs, being smallest in Herpetodryas, largest in Chlorophis.
If we compare the supra-labials in the three we shall find them each of a peculiar type ; in Dryophylax the sixth and seventh being remarkable for their large size.
The scales upon the body are also different.
If we examine the teeth comparatively, we shall find that in Chlorophis the maxillaries, which are smooih, present a marked curvature anteriorly, the points inclining backward, the three posterior longer than the other, the two last more especially, which are also much more robust ; neither of the posterior teeth appear to be grooved.
In Herpetodryas the teeth are smooth and resemble each other, (Aglyphodontes isodontiens, D. and B.)
In Dryophylax the posterior maxillary teeth are longer and channelled, (Opistoglyphe dipsadien, D. and B.)
Dryophylax is a South American genus, exclusively, so far as is known, but Herpetodryas.
according to Dumeril and Bibron, exists not only in America, but in Madagascar and the Isle of France.
The following are the generic characters of Chlorophis : Maxillary teeth recurved, the posterior ones less than the anterior, the three last larger than the others, the two hinder ones especially, which are not channelled ; nostrils between anterior nasal, and frenal; frenal remarkable for its large size ; one antocular, two postoculars ; nine superior labials, the eye resting on the 5th and 6th, and a very small part of the founh ; three anterior supralabials small, the three posterior large ; rostral rather high ; two internasals and two prefrontals, vertical, pentagonal, much broader anteriorly, longer thau broad, excavated laterally, presenting an acute angle behind ; occipitals pentagonal, well developed; supra-oculars not projecting; eyes round and quite prominent; scales smooth, in 15 rows, quadrangular, about twice as long as broad anteriorly, broader posteriorlv, the inferior row the largest ; a single pre1857.]

Remarks.
We at first supposed that this serpent might be identical with the Dendrophis Chenonii, Reinhardt, from Guinea, but the nasal in that species is between two nasal plates, and according to Dumerii and Bibron, the preanal scute is double.
They also state that were it not for the difference in the teeth, they would consider it a true Dendrophis; now Dendrophis has a much larger row of scales along the middle line of the back, which Chlorophis has not.
Dumerii and Bibron also mention that in Leptophis Chenonii there are 154 urostega — M. Reinhardt, 108 — 126.
Fam.
LYCODONTIANS.
Among the serpents in the collection of Dr. Ford, are three different genera of Lycodontians, three of different ages belonging to the genus Boedon, and two of undescribed genera.
We propose to give an account of them, and also a Boedon presented some time ago by Dr. Burtt, U. S. Navy, from the Isle de Los.
The family of Lycodontians is characterized by Dumerii and Bibron as "serpents with smooth teeth, or unchannelled, always unequal, the anterior longer than those which follow, distributed in numerous series upon the jaws, and without vacant spaces between them.
Body cylindrical ; head larger behind than the neck," the essential characters being the existence of smooth teeth (Aglyphodonts) " of unequal force and length in both jaws."
Erpet.
Gen. tom.
vii.
p. 357.
The Lycodontians are divided into four tribes : 1, Boedonians ; 2, Lycodontians; 3, Eugnathians ; 4, Pareasians.
In the Boedonians the palatine teeth are unequal, the submaxillary teeth separated; those above not separated.
In the Lycodontians these teeth are distinct, isolated ; the anterior pterjgo-palatine teeth not longer than those which follow ; the submaxillary teeth unequal.
In the Eugnathians the submaxillary teeth are not separated by a free space, the pterygo-palatine equal; and in the Pareasians, as in the Eugnathians, the mandibular teeth are much longer in front than those which succeed them, but in the former the anterior pterygo-palatine teeth are much longer.
The essential characters of the sub-genus Boedon, belonging to the first tribe Boedonians, and the family Lycodontians, the ninth of the Aglyphodont Ophidians, in Dumerii and Bibron's arrangement, consist in having "the four or five superior maxillary teeth longer by half than those which follow, and which are nearly equal among themselves and regularly spaced ; then a free interval ; the four or five first palatine teeth longer ; the five first inferior maxillaries longer and more curved."

One specimen presented by Dr. Burtt, U. S. N. We have in the collection of Dr. Ford three specimens of a serpent formerly described in the Proceedings under the name Caelopeltis virgata, but which is a species of Boedon, and although allied to the species above described, differs from it in the following particulars : The largest of the specimens is considerably smaller than quadrivittatum ; the head is shorter and more obtuse anteriorly ; the temples more protuberant ; the frontal is more narrow anteriorly, less acute posteriorly ; the superior labials resemble those of quadrivittatum sufficiently, but there is a difference in t^e form of the frenal and antocular plate ; there is also but a single row of temporals, with a single large one situated between the parietal and the three plates constituting this row; 1857.]
the shape of the scales does not differ materially, but the number is less, there being but 23 rows near the middle of the body, from four to 11 rows upon the tail.
The two lateral stripes oq each side of the head are of a yellow color and more narrow, and meet at the rostral, the interspace forming an acute angle, whereas in quadrivittatum they meet upon the internasal and prefrontals, displaying a quadrangular interspace.

It has also a certain relation, in the general disposition of the plates upon the head and teeth, with Lycognathus cucuUatas, a North African serpent, but a comparison of the two proves at once that they belong to different genera.
The outline of the head, the relative proportions of the internasals and prefrontals, and the form of the frontal plate, are very different ; the nostrils are deeply excavated in Hormonotus ; in cucullatus there is no larger dorsal row, and the scales are shorter, &c. It is also a much smaller animal.
The species which remains to be described is a quite different looking serpent from the last, presenting a series of generic characters quite remarkable, more especially the form of the frontal plate.

There is but a single channelled posterior tooth on each side in these specimens, and therefore they cannot belong to the genus Triglophodon of Dum.

Remarks.
We formerly placed this serpent in the genus Dipsas, from its large head, compressed body and the large row of hexagonal scales along the middle line of the back; but a careful examination of the teeth, as well as of the external form, shows that it does not belong to that genus ; it is one of the most remarkable of the Arboricole Opystoglyphs, so characteristic of the herpetological fauna of the western coast of Africa; we had supposed also that this serpent might be identical with the Dipsas cynodon of Schegel, (Opetiodon cynodon D. and B.)
but in Opetiodon there is but one pre-ocular, the flanks are rounded, pupil oval, &c. The frontal and supra-ocular plates in Toxicodryas are quite different in shape from the corresponding plates in the figure of Dipsas cynodon by Prof Schegel (Abbildungen, pi.
xi.
fig.
10 and 11,) the supraoculars being more narrow iu front, the frontal more narrow posteriorly; the two last supra-labials are different in shape and much larger in Toxicodryas than in fig.
11.
In 0. cynodon, the pre-oculars are almost contiguous to the frontal, in T. Blandingii they are separated by an interval of about a line, seven or eight temporals instead of five, of which three touch the post-oculars (two in T.
Blandingii.)
Cynodon is a native of Java and Borneo.
The characters [Feb. of the serpent above described, resemble much those of Triglophodon fuscum, also from the Gaboon, (D. and B. vol.
vii.
p. 1102, Appendix,) but it has three channelled posterior teeth.
There can be no doubt that although allied, Toxicodryas and Trit^^lophodon are distinct genera; compared with a specimen of Triglophodon dendrophilum from Java, of which we have a fine specimen in our colleclion, due to the liberality of the administration of the Garden of Plants, through Prof. Dumeril, we find that the scales in T. Blandingii are more narrow, the tail lousrer and more slender, and the plates upon tlie head different ; the vertical in T. Blandingii is much more narrow posteriorly, the rostral not so high, the parietals are much smaller; there are ?m-o pre-oculars, and the inferior margin of the orbit is formed by the fourth, fifth and sixth supra-labials ; in Triglophodon by the third, fourth and fifth, &c. Both have a large row of scales along the middle of the back.
Toxicodryas is a genus quite distinct from Tarbophis, (Ailurophis, Bonap.)
Sub-Old.
Proterogli/phs.
Among the serpents in the collection of Dr. Ford, is one of the black variety of Naja, six feet 31 inches in length.
There is also a younger and much more slender specimen.
Besides these we have another and much larger one than either, presented several years ago by Dr. Ford, measuring G ft. 9,] inch.
(Fr.)
in length.
Neither of these correspond with the description or figure of the black variety of Naja haje in Dr. Smith's work on the Reptiles of Southern Africa.
The most striking difference consists in the coloration, the South African species being uniformly black below, the variety from the Gaboon having upon the anterior part of the abdomen a greater or less number of black bands of unequal breadth, the interspaces being yellow, the throat and chin also yellow, (white probably during life).
Dumeril and Bibron state that the Museum of Paris possesses three large specimens of the black variety described by Dr. Smith, one from Senegal, one from Morocco, the third from the White Nile, They admit but two species of Naja, the tripudians and haje ; in the first the sixth superior labial is quite small, in the latter very large ; which also wants the spectacle figure upon the neck, and the neck is less dilatable.
This difference between the labial plates, however, is presumed to be not an invariable character.
In the plate of Naja haje in the great work on Egypt, there are several black bands passing across the abdomen, near its middle, one of them very broad, more so than in any of the Gaboon specimens, which in that variety are also situated much more anteriorly.
Dumeril and Bibron state that in the greater part of the specimens they possess from Java, Sumatra, China and difl'erent regions of the East there are several gastrostega of a beautiful black, forming a transverse band more or less broad, followed by other scutes of a white color.
Comparing the large Gaboon specimen with A. tripndians, from Bengal, I find a single dark colored band nine lines in breadth, running across the anterior part of the abdomen, quite near to the throat, and as stated by Prof. Schlegel the sixth supra-labial much smaller than the corresponding one in the African species.
In the tripudians this plate is separated from the post-oculars by a large plate, in N. haje it is in contact with them.
There is a difference in the proportional size of the inter-nasals and pre-frontals, but this may be merely the effect of age ; for, although the former are comparatively much smaller than the latter in the adidt W. African specimens, they more nearly correspond in the younger individual as they do in that from Bengal.
The frontal plate is pentagonal in both, but in the Asiatic specimen it is quite narrow.
* In the E. India serpent there are 23 rows of scales near the middle of the body, in the Gaboon but 19.
We have not the materials for a thorough study of the two admitted species, but consider those from Gaboon as belonging to a variety of the haje, for which the name melano* In the plate of the head of the tripudians in Prof. Traill's translation of Schlegel it is represented as quite broad, perhaps the adult.

Remarks.
This is one of the largest and most savage looking of the venomous serpents.
Dr. Smith gives from 5 to 6 feet as the length of the South African species.
According to him they feed on small quadrupeds, birds and eggs, and climb trees readily to rob nests.
The genus Naja belongs to the 4th section or sub-order of Ophidians in Dumeril and Bibron's arrangement, viz : The Proteroglyph or Apistophid serpents (serpents Proteroglyphes dits Apistophides,) of which the essential characters given are, — " Serpents in which the anterior teeth are channelled and not perforated at their base," and to the first group into which this section is subdivided, viz : the Conocercal Proteroglyphs, (P. conocerques) having a conical or rounded tail ; the second group, the platycercals, and which live in the water having this organ flat.
The family of Conocercals includes nine genera, viz : Elaps, Pseudoelaps, Furina, Trimersurus, Alecto, Sepedon, Causus, Bungarus, Naja, twothirds of which exist in our collection.
In the largest of the three specimens there are two large and strong anterior channelled teeth, of about equal length on the left side ; on the right side one, having behind it one or two smaller teeth.
In the other specimen but a single one is seen on each side; palatine and pterygoid teeth in two longitudinal rows.

The description of the Echidna Gabonica, D. & B., given in the Erpetologie generale, corresponds with it perfectly, and no mention is made, nor does the drawing display the narrow headed black mark bordered with yellow, so characteristic ofE, nasicornis, and the longitudinal bars upon the middle line of the back are not cut in triangle at their extremities, which is the case even in the very young nasicornis.
Both specimens referred to have unfortunately been destroyed, the skull of the adult alone remaining, which, however, I am inclined to believe belongs to E. nasicornis.
As no detailed account of this remarkable animal appears to have been published, we propose to give a full account of it.

Three horny projections on each side of the muzzle, the anterior small, the posterior which is immediately over the nostril quite long.
Description.
The head is more or less triangular above, covered with scales, very strongly carinated, the carinations so developed as to assume the form of triangular leaf-like projections, giving a sensation of roughness to the laterosuperior upper part of the head ; there are three or four scales immediately within the circular row above surrounding the eye, which are larger than the others ; the carinie of these scales are less f )liated than the rest, and resemble spines ; the eye is of moderate size, ovoid in shape, and somewhat projecting; the nostrils are large, on a line with the eye, three lines from it and ar^not lateral, but look upward and outward; there are three foliated scales upon each side of the muzzle, the posterior 6 lines in length ; the rostral plate is broad and narrow with a convex margin above, concave below, very different in shape from that of Vipera ammodytes ; there are sixteen supra-labial plates on each side, most of which resemble each other in shape, presenting a serrated margin inferiorly; there are sixteen superior labials which differ from each other, and the anterior are more extended transversely ; the anterior geneials are very large ; the posterior quite narrow ; the pterygo-palatine teeth do not pursue a strictly longitudinal course but diverge posteriorly ; the fangs are enormous and lie entirely concealed in their sheath; the neck is more' narrow than the posterior part of the head, the body quite thick at the middle ; the tail rather shorty terminating in a horn-like pointed projection ; the scales are short and broad, strongly carinated, the inferior row much the largest ; 44 may be counted in a row near the middle of the body ; 18 on each side of the neck, 16 rows at the base of the tail.

Remarks.
Dumeril and Bibron are evidently in error in placing this animal in the genus Vipera.
In Vipera the nostrils are lateral, in Echidna laterosuperior.
la Vipera ammodytes the rostral plate is very high ; the posterior geneials differ much ; ammodytes has a large supra-ocular ; there is but one row of plates between the supra-labials and the rows of scales which surround the eye ; the scales in ammodytes are long, short in nasicornis.
The same may be said of Vipera aspis.
Compared with Echidna arietans of the Cape, we find absence of the supra-ocular, two rows between the scales beneath the eye and the supra-labials, and the scales short, like those of nasicornis.
The difference in the number of rows of scales between the eyes and the supra-labials constitutes a good specific character in serpents belonging to the same genus, but the position of the nostrils and the form of the scales are constant and of generie importance.
* Echidna nasicornis belongs to the 5th section or suborder of Ophidians in Dumeril and Bibron's arrangement, viz., the Solenoglyphs, (serpents Solenoglyphes dits Thanatophides,) of which the following are the essential characters: " Serpents having teeth in both jaws, of which the anterior supra-maxillariea are alone channelled and perforated by a canal in the length of their base."

BATRACHIANS.
In the synoptical table of the genera of Raniforms, in the 8th volume of Dumeril and Bibron's work, (1841,) but two genera of the 16 there determined are mentioned as having no palatine teeth, viz., Oxyglossus and Leiuperus ; the first with a rhomboidal, the second with an oval tongue, in both entire.
In Arthroleptis, Smith, (Illustrations of South African Zoology, 1849,) the toes are without webs.
la the Batrachian now under consideration, the most remarkable structure is shown in the tongue, which presents a central pedicel, but is bound down in its anterior half along the middle by cellular tissue, as in the genus Heredia, among the Urodeles recently discovered in California.
We propose for this remarkable Batrachian, and which, should this conformation be found to exist in other individuals, would, from the connecting link between the Anourous Batrachia, and the Caducibranchiate Urodeles, the name of HETER0GL0S3A.

Remarks.
Dactylethra belongs in Dumeril and Bibron's arrangement, to the second group of the Anourous, or Phrynaglossal Batrachians, (Phrynaglosses) and family of the Pipteformes, being entirely destitute of a tongue, wheieas the 1st gioup, or the f haneroglossal, have this organ " developed in a greater or less degree."
The Phrynaglossal Batrachians, including but two genera at present known, viz., Dactylethra and Pipa, have also this very remarkable peculiarity, that instead of two eustachian foramina, there is but one, and that situated at the middle of the posterior part of the palate.
In Dactylethra Mdlleti this is very large.
We had proposed for this singular Pip^form the name spinosa, from the spur at the base of the first toe, but having received the 12lh number of the Revue de Zoologie for 1856, we find it mentioned and referr'^d to in the interesting and important paper of Prof. Aug.

The description in the 4th vol.
of the Proceedings is quite accurate, and characterizes this serpent well, except its dentition.
Its jet black and silken lustre, and large and somewhat impudent eyes, make, we should think, this reptile one of the most remarkable among the Arboricole Ophidians so numerous in Western Africa.

Descrijjtion.
The head is long, narrow and rounded in front, somewhat protuberant at the temples, covered above with nine plates exclusive of a very small one looking like an occipital ; the rostral measures about two lines in breadth by one in heighth ; presenting more or less distinctly three facets above, the two exterior in contact each with the naso-rostral, the middle with the internasals, the external margin convex, the inferior concave ; the naso-rostral is quadrangular, the naso-frenal rhomboidal in shape ; the frenal is also quadrangular with its supero-posterior angle rounded ; the two nasals are in contact above with the internasals, the frenal with the pre-frontal ; the pre-ocular is large, its superior portion much more so than the inferior ; rectangular below triangular above, presenting an anterior and posterior angle and one superior, in contact inferiorly with the third and fourth supra-labial, above with the prefrontal and supra-ocular ; there are two post-oculars, the inferior prolonged forward, its anterior portion between the fifth supra-labial, and the eye, which reclines upon it; the internasals are longer than broad, the pre-frontals on the contrary remarkable for their breadth ; they pass down on the side of the head between the naso-frenal and pre-ocular, to reach the frenal as above described ; the frontal is remarkable for its length, and in this respect' differs greatly from Coronella, in which it is short, and broader than long ; it is hexagonal and more narrow posteriorly ; the supra-oculars are much longer than broad, more narrow in front; the parietals are of moderate size, in contact anteriorly with the supra-ocular and the superior post-ocular ; there are eight superior labials on the left side, the seventh and eighth on the right being fused together and presenting one large plate ; the inferior margin of the eye rests on the fourth, wiiich is more distinctly quadrangular, than any of the other superior labials ; there are five plates between the supra-labials and the parietals, two in front and three posteriorly; the anterior geneials are somewhat broader than the posterior and not quite so long ; the supra-maxillary teeth are long, smooth, unequally spaced, the posterior teeth the longest, the two anterior more recurved than the others ; pterygo-palatine teeth much smaller, straight, their points thrown far backward, in two long rows ; these rows are not parallel, but approach each other near the middle, and diverge anteriorly, the two presenting a long urceolate outline ; the teeth in the lower jaw are much smaller than those in the upper, shorter anteriorly; the neck is more narrow than the head posteriorly, the body more or less cylindrical and much thicker in the middle, decreasing toward the tail, which is of considerable length, and tapers to a poiat; there are 17 rows of smooth scales near the middle of the body, the same number upon the neck, 13 upon the tail near its root ; the inferior row of of scales is the largest ; those upon the sides about as broad as long (U line,) quadrangular ; those upon the back distinctly hexagonal, and somewhat narrower; this difference in the form of the scales is.
indistinct upon the neck and posterior part of the body ; gasirostega rather broad but not ascending upon the flanks which present no marked angularity.
Coloration.
Head yellowish above mingled with olive; the three or four posterior of the superior labials bordered inferiorly with black, as well as the posterior margin of the fourth ; several of the inferior labials margined with black ; chin and throat yellow, black spotted ; ground color olive above, with about [Feb. 15 narrow yellow transverse fasciae, extendinp: a short distance beyond the anterior half of the trunk ; a series of lateral olive colored triangular markings, 28 in number, on each side of the neck and body continuous with the ground color above, aud the apex iuf'erior, the same numlier of ytUow ones inosculating with the latter, aud continuous at their bases with the yellow ground color beneath ; the transverse fasciae terminating laterally at the apices of these yellow triangular interspaces ; throat, abdomen, and uuder part of tail yellow, with numerous bluish or olive colored spots.

The previous description in vol.

This genus is closely allied to Coronella, but differs from it in the shape of the frontal plate which is short and broad in the latter genus, in the form of the internasals which are longer in Hcteronotus, in the pre-frontals which arc not so long, the position of the eye and the.
shape of the scales; the tail is much shorter in Coronella, and the teeth not so strongly developed.
Heteronotus is another of the many '"emarkable forms recently discovered in Western Africa, which promises to present the most valuable materials to the Zoologist in the determination of the higher problems of science.

The head of this species presents numerous singularly shaped black markings above; the lips, chin and throat, thickly spotted with black ; ground color of chin and throat yellow ; the black points are much more distinct upon the flanks, scarcely visible upon the back; gastrostega marked near their external extremities with a longitudinal black mark or spot ; preanal scale single ; dorsal row of scales differently shaped from the others ; two or three inferior rows of scales, larger than the rest, which, except the dorsal row, are long, slender and quadrangular as in Dendrophis ; 17 rows; tail mutilated.
This species of Psammophis differs from all those described by Dumeril and Bibron.
Among the serpents not in the collection of Dr. Ford, but from Liberia, and presented several years ago by Dr. Goheen, is a small Psammophis, probably young, with 17 rows of scales, and 102 sub-caudal scutes.

The drawidg iu the S. African Illustrations is mHgnilied and tberet'dre the fangs iu both animals are probably of equal length.
The gtit-trostega are quite broad, and extend very slightly if at all ujion the flanks, which are rounded; the neck is of about the same thickness as the head posteriorly, not so thick as the body at its middle ; tlie geneials are broad and short, there are no posterior ones, properly so called but a single row of larger scales on each side within the supra-labials, the anterior the longest.
The fangs in this serpent are remarkable; they are probably more capable of erection than Dr. Smith supposes, but their shape is [)eculiiir; they arc convex anteriorly, concave posteriorly, with a superior and inferior ritlge, compressed laterally, with an elevation in the middle, resembling somewhat a squalus tooth, but of course much more narrow ; they are not channelled anteriorly, but a canal can be distinctly seen running along their middle, the tooth being perforated at its base.
It therefore takes its place among the Solcnoglyphs and not the Proteroglyphs, as Dumeril and Bibron conjectured it should from its general resemblance to Elaps, (a specimen of the animal not having at that time reached the Museum of Paris,) and the family A'iperidie, characterized by the absence of fossettes between the eyes and the nostrils, which on the contrary exist in the Crotalidie.
Gen.
Remarks.
We have endeavored in the preceding paper to give as correct an account as our means will permit of the West African Reptiles that have come under our notice.
All the specimens described or referred to in previous numbers of the Proceedings as presented by Dr. Ford, come from the Gaboon and not Liberia.
This is an important correction, for the two countries are widely separate, Monrovia, the capitol of Liberia being in North or Ujtper Guinea, and the Gaboon in South or Lower Guinea; the difference in latitude between the above mentioned town and the mouth of the Gaboon where Dr. Ford is stationed as Physician to an American Missionary establishment being 450 miles, and in longitude 1400; the difference in space measured along the line of the coast 1450 miles.
This rectification is of much consequence in the study of the geographical distribution of the Reptiles of[Africa.
When we consider the very great distance of the Cape of Good Hope from the Gaboon, it is not surprising that the reptiles of the latter region should differ so much from those of the former.
Indeed, it is doubtful if among all the reptiles figured and described by Dr. Smith, there be two absoliilrli/ identical and common to both countries.
Dr. Smith mentions the tollowiug species known to exist in W. Africa, as found also at the Cape, viz.
: Kinixis erosa, Varanus niloticus, Chamadeo dilepis, Agama coIonorura,Dinophis angusticep3(NaiaS.
)and Causus ihombeatus.
He enumerates nevertheless and describes 144 species belonging to 84 genera.
According to Prof. Peters, of Berlin, the following species existing in W. Africa are found also in Madagascar, viz., Cham;c!eo dilepis, OxybelJs Kirtlandii, (Lecomptei, D. & B.)
Echidna nasicornis, Dactylethra Miilleri, ( Archiv.
fur Naturgeschichte, 1855, p. 43,) and (Monatsberichte zu Berliner Acadamie, 1854, p.
C14.)
Few countries probably present a more interesting field to the Herpetologist than Africa, whether we regard the variety or the remarkable character of the forms, and we hope, through the efforts of M. DuChaillu, who is travelling in the Gaboon, with a view to discover if possible the source of the Congo or river Zaire, and of Dr. Ford, who is stationed at the mouth of the Gaboon, that we shall be enabled to develops more fully the Herpetology of that region.
We have prepared the following list of the species inhabiting Liberia and the Gaboon so far as known, and refer to the splendid work of Dr. Smith for those found at the Cape.

Nothing is more striking in the study of the various reptilian forms above described than the simplicity of the elements out of which so great a variety of essential characters are deduced, constituting generic types, permanent in their nature, andlinked from the beginning with circumstances of physical geogra})hy not yet fully made out, l^ut which a more thorough and accurate analysis may euable us to discover.
It is probable that a careful and precise investigation of the genera now determined, even by the most eminent Herpetologists, taking into consideration not one or several sets of characters but the entire animal viewed in regard, not only to its anatomy, whicliis of equal importance, but also its geographical position, and so to speak, its i)hysiology, will of necessity cause many of them to be separa,ted, constituting either distinct generic forms, or sub-generic types, associated naturally with the physical characters of the soil and climate in which they live ; and hence it is of the utmost importance that those animals not liable to changes of domicile as is the case with birds, and even the mammals, should be collected from all known regions of the globe, their habitat being ascertained with the greatest precision, and their anatomy studied with care, so that we may be enabled to deduce the laws which govern their existence, and determine their characters, which cannot be done for a long time to come, and until the facilities for the prosecution of such pursuits are much greater than exist at the present time, but which we have no doubt will ultimately be accomplished.
Natural History, phj-sical geography and jdiysiology are so intimately connected, that no real progress can be made without their combined study ; and in this manner instead of the artificial and disjointed aspect which the first of these has often been made to present, we shall have a system based upon nature itself, the only true and real foundation of all progress whether in science or morals, or in the solution of those perplexed I)roblems which at present so much and so fruitlessly disturb the public mind.
Inquiries of this kind, so far from promoting a spirit of irreverence, induce the contrary, leading man not only in the letter, but better in the spirit, and in the r>.
'al constitution of things, to search out the laws which determine his well being, and give rise in him to the most profound sentiments of humility and worship of the great (Ji'cator, whose iutclligonte and power at every step excite his wonder and admiration.

Dr. Uhler stated : That on the night of the 10th inst., about 11.}
o'clock, he was startled in his residence at Manayunk, by a heavy rumbling noise, and shaking of the house and furniture, and rattling of the windows ; the sound resembled that of a heavy wagon drawn over hard frozen ground.
In the course of four or five seconds, the noise and trembling were repeated.
Dr. U. raised the window immediately, but found everything perfectly quiet ; there was no wind, and he attributed the noise to an earthquake.
The sound appeared to come from the north east, and then returned; the whole duration was probably twenty seconds.
He had no means of determining the amount or direction of the oscillation.

Mr. Ashraead made the following verbal communication regarding specimens of Algae, presented by him this evening and upon a former occasion : In the catalogue of Marine Algae from Key West, which I presented to the Academy last April, there were five undetermined species of the genus Caulerpa, and two of Laurencia.
These, together with some others, supposed to be new, I referred to Prof. Harvey of Trinity College, Dublin.
I received a letter a few days since from that eminent Algologist, giving the true names, which I have attached to the specimens on the table, as follows : Caulerpa mexicana.

Prof. Harvey makes the following remarks : "As far as I at present know, it is nondescript — but it is not new to me, for I found it myself at Key West, but did not find it growing.
It is a very remarkable species, diifering from those of similar habit, in its greater size, and in the extreme obtuseness of the pinnje."
Of this rare species I found but one plant.
It was growing in company with Caulerpa plumaris, under the bridge leading to Fort Taylor, in a shady position, and where it was sheltered from the action of the waves.
Its fibrous roots penetrated the coral sand for a* considerable extent, from which a number of fronds sprung up at intervals.
I collected every fragment I could find.

This species has the form, size and sculpture of D. integer ice, from the same locality, but difl'ers by the more globose thorax, and trilobed clypeus ; the anterior thighs of D. integer are also nearly black, while in the present they are dark red.
The marginal stria in D. integer ceases at the humerus : in the present it is disti\ictly continued along the base: the dors.al striae do not completely attain the anterior declivity, thej are punctured behind the middle, then smooth to the tip ; although not deep they are entire, and the first, second, seventh and eighth, are deeper at the apex : the eighth is obliterated for the rest of its course as usual.
The upper tooth of the anterior tibiae is very small, the second one is prominent, the terminal is as long as the terminal spur, and both are slightly curved.

The upper denticle of the anterior tibias is very small, the lower one is acute and prominent, the terminal tooth is long and curved, but the inferior spur is yet longer and more curved.
The strife of the elytra do not extend upon the anterior declivity ; they are very strongly punctured to the middle, and then become gradually obliterated to the tip, when the first, second and seventh are slightly impressed : the eighth stria is obliterated and the marginal ceases at the humerus : the interstices are convex, and the third are without punctures.

Dr. Suckley The three individuals, the only ones that I have had the opportunity of examining, are in such a mutilated condition as to render it very difficult to characterize them properly ; enough, however, remains to indicate their distinctness from all the other species that have yet been noticed.
They liave three ranges of discoidal areolets to the primary wings, and the triangle is crossed by a single nervule.
The three foregoing insects were kindly placed in my hands by Dr. Chas.
GLrard, to whom I would embrace this opportunity of returning my thanks.

Of tlie above list of vertebrate remains tliose of Mososaurus, Cladocyclus, Enchodus, and Saurocephalus were obtained from deposits of tlie cretaceous period.
The remains of Deinodon, Palccoscincus, Trachodon, Troodon, ?Crocodilus, and Lepidotus, were discovered by Dr. F. V. Ilayden, in a deposit, on the Judith River, which I have suspected to be of equivalent age with the Wealden formation of Europe.
The remains of Compsemys, Emys, and Mylognathus, were found at Long Lake, Nebraska, together with those of Trionyx, the same species of which appears also to be common to the deposit just mentioned of the Judith River.
Oreodon, Ayriochccrus, PcubrotUeriumj Lcptomeryx, Leptauchenia, Froiomeryx, [March, Merycodus, Tilanotherium, Leptochcerus, Hyracodon, Merychippus, Ischyromys, Paloeolayus, Eumys, Deiniclis, and Leptarctus are peculiar, extinct, mammalian genera, from the tertiary formations of Nebraska, -wliicb have heretofore been generally viewed as belonging to the eocene period, but which from their affinities, from the associated genera, and the absence of others so common in the eocene deposits of Europe, I suspect rather to belong to the miocene period.
The first seven genera, above mentioned, are true ruminants, with the teeth constructed upon the same type as those of living ruminants ; — a type which is not found in the tertiary deposits of Europe and Asia earlier than the miocene period.
EtUdodon, Paloeochcerus, Rhinoceros, Eipparion, Sieneofiber, AmpMcyon, and Machairodus, are common to the Nebraska tertiary deposits and to the miocene and later tertiary deposits of Europe ; and they have not been found in the eocene formations of the latter continent.
Of the genera Anchitherium, Hyopolamus, and Ilycenodon, species are found common to the Nebraska tertiary deposits and the European eocene and miocene deposits.
Remains of Palceotherium, Anoplotherium, and Lophiodon, so common in the eocene formations of Europe, are entirely absent from the Nebraska tertiary formations.
Titanoiherium of Nebraska most nearly approaches the miocene Chalicotherium of Europe and Asia.
The Nebraska rodents Ischyromys, PalcBolagus, and Eumys most closely approach the Arctomys, Lepus, and J/ms of European miocene and later deposits.
Very numerous remains of Testudo are found in association with the Nebraska tertiary mammals ; and extinct species of the same genus belong generally to the miocene and later deposits of Europe.
The remains of Mastodon and Camelops mentioned in the the list, I suspect to belong to the post pliocene age of the upper Missouri country.
Ischyr other ium appears to be an animal allied to the llanatus.
Its remains are stated by Dr. Hayden to have been obtained from a lignite bed (miocene*) near Moreau and Grand rivers ; but I must leave it to this indefatigable explorer to determine whether it belongs to the same age as the numerous extinct terrestrial mammals of Nebraska.
Thespcsius I suspect to be a huge dinosaurian.
Its remains are stated to belong to the lowest member of the lignite formations (miocene) of Grand River.
The species of Clupea was discovered by Dr. John Evans, in a tertiary deposit on Green River, Missouri ; but the exact age of this formation I have no means of determining.

Investigation on the Rock Guano from the Islands of the Caribbean Sea.
BY WM.
J. TAYLOR.
Though much has been written and published on the Columbian Guano of the Caribbean Sea, which is also termed Phosphatic Guano, native SuperPhosphate of Lime, &c., I have considered the subject not entirely exhausted, and have for some time past been paying especial attention to its composition, and have also endeavored to gather all possible information regarding its occurrence.
To Dr. D. Luther, President of the Philadelphia Guano Company, I am particularly indebted, for his kindness in furnishing me with material for the investigation from the various groups of islands, and for information regarding * Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.

92 its occurrence.
To Dr. F. A. Genth I am also indebted for allowing me to make the investigation in his laboratory.
The Guano rock is found on Islands N. E. and N. of the coast of Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea, and belonging to that Republic ; the islands form groups or keys composed of one hundred or more small islands, inhabited principally and indeed almost solely, by water fowl, who resort there in immense numbers for laying their eggs.
Mr. Cassin informs me that the birds are those commonly known as Gulls, Pelicans, and Cormorants ; these have been the instruments by which the immense deposits of Guano have been formed.
But what the process has been is a problem not yet fully solved.
The Columbian Guano is a hard rock, consisting of two distinct portions : the outer exterior crust, consisting of a white, frequently reniform coating, which in places where it is not decomposed has a polished surface not unlike enamel ; it is composed of concentric layers, each of which is about two or more lines in thickness.
The entire outer crust forms but a very small proportion of the whole rock ; a carefully selected portion of this has been analyzed, which had not undergone any apparent decomposition, and upon which the enamelled surface was well preserved.

Below this exterior crust the rock has a varied appearance ; it is of a dark brown color, in places quite black, varying in others to a lighter shade, in which portion are frequent cavities filled with minute crystals of gypsum, readily recognizable with a pocket lens.
The darkest portion is the most solid, with a slightly vitreous lustre, and of a much greater tensibility and hardness than any other portion of the guano ; it has a sub-concoidal fracture, sometimes splitting into thin fragments, which are translucent, through some portions of it 1 have observed frequently, thin irregular bands, l-32d to l-16th of an inch in width, which has the appearance of carbon.

This so called lower layer [March, 95 has certain!}'
a surface exposed, as the specimen which I have examined, has been much weathered; the outer portion is partially reniform, which in places shows a slight enamel, though not near as distinct as on the specimens from Monk's and El Roque islands.
It has evidently been formed in layers, which when broken across show a slightly banded appearance not unlike that already described as characteristic of portions of the rock from Monk's Island ; the color varies from a buff to an ochrcous brown ; it is hard, brittle and much more readily pulverized than the Monk's Islands guano rock.
An opinion may seem premature, but I am inclined to the belief that this has once been as the guano rock from Monk's Island, which has undergone changes from causes not yet fully studied, which seems ihore probable from the fact that small quantities of Phosphate of Alumina have been found in the Monk's Island rock.

The alumina and phosphoric acid exist most likely in the form of Wavellite which has the formula 3AI2 O3 , 2PO54-I2HO.
It is diflScult in a rock which is in progress of decomposition to obtain other than approximate formulae.
This island of Centinella is now inhabited by immense numbers of waterfowl, many of which roost on the cliffs ; some of these roosts have been long occupied, and judging from the signs on the rocks beneath, have been much resorted to.
Mr. Richards of this city, who visited the islands a short time since broke off a portion of the concretion which cover the cliffs beneath a bird roost of this description ; the organic properties had mostly been removed by causes which had converted the inorganic constituents into a guano rock, which in its composition, is not unlike that from Monk's Island and El Roque.
Mr. Richards mentioned that when first obtained it had quite a strong odor, which has now almost disappeared ; it is very hard and was difficult to powder.

A guano rock has recently been brought from a group of Islands called El Roque, in the Caribbean Sea.
In composition it resembles very closely that brought from Monk's Island, the specimens that I have analysed, contain however, a much larger quantity of sulphuric acid than has been found in the latter rock.
The appearance of the body of the two rocks is also much alike, bat in the specimens which I have seen from EI Roque the exterior ( rust is very different ; it is rarely more than a slight coating ; in some places it has a slight , appearance of the enamel, when examined with a pocket lens; the surface is very irregular, often containing cavities which are lined with the same white coating.

The guano rock from the various groups of islands has very varying compoeition, as has been seen from the foregoing investigations ; it is found in layers, and the surface sometimes covered with an alluvial deposit ; these layers are in places highly inclined, showing that since their deposition dynamic causes have' altered their original position.
This same phenomenon is described as occurring at the Chincha islands in the Peruvian guano, where it is found in layers two or three yards in thickness.
Various theories have been formed and published as to the origin of the rock guano ; these are doubtless premature, as the accounts as to its occurrence are founded on reports of those not accustomed to noting geological phenomenon.
Prof. C. IJ.
Shepard has, with his characteristic energy, extended his mineralogical species to various portions of this rock, which he severally describes* and designates generally as Pyroguanite minerals, and entirely destitute of ammonia ; but examinations made of an average sample of a cargo from Monk's Island showed one-half per cent, of nitrogen.
Every specimen which I have examined, has on ignition given very marked evidence of burning organic matter.
How this can be retained in a rock subjected to the agency of heated trap is as difiBcult to reconcile, as that the composition of minerals existing with and forming a part of its mass, as Prof. Shepard describes,* containing water in their composition.
Moreover, how can a rock subjected to the agency of heated trap have as its principal basis a salt with the formula 2CaO, HO, PO5 which is the formula ascribed to it by Drs.
Piggot and Beckell, of Baltimore, and which seems to be the proper composition of some portions, as shown by analysis of Monk's Island rock (V), though in the analysis of the specimen from El Roque (X) there is obtained the formula, 3CaO PO5.
As I have already mentioned, this Guano rock from Los Monges has been called a native Super-Phosphate of Lime, but no satisfactory proofs are given as to its meriting such a name ; phosphoric acid being found in solution after the guano is treated with water is no proof that it exists in a free state.
Phosphate of Lime, when recently precipitated, is soluble to a slight extent in pure water (R. Phillips, Ann.
Phil.
22,188).
Berzelius long since discovered Phosphates of Lime and Alumina in the water and deposits of hot springs at Carlsbad.
f That Phosphates are insoluble and must be rendered free before becoming efficacious as fertilizers is an erroneous though a very prevalent opinion.
According to BrischofJ Phosphate of Lime must be regarded as present in all water running into the sea ; it has already been detected in the waters of the Dee and and of the Don, and it will most likely be found in the waters of all rivers.
Phosphate of Lime and Magnesia have also been found in the waters of an artesian well at Wildegg, in the Canton Argan (Switzerland).
Phosphote of Lime has been shown to be present in sea water by Clemm^ and by Forchammer.|| According to Berzelius it is the Z>i-phosphate which is found in the mineral waters,^ which is readily soluble in water saturated with carbonic acid.
The Basic-Phosphate of Lime is also readily soluble in water containing carbonic acid ; Bischof gives * Am.

[March, a very interesting table of the degrees of solubility of the various basic-Phosphates of Lime iu water saturated with carbonic acid gas.
'-" It is not only in carbonic acid waters that Phosphate of Lime is soluble ; basic-Phosphate of Lime dissolves in 3.150 parts of water, containing one-twelfth by weight of Chloride of Sodium.
The presence of Chloride of Ammonium increases the solubility still more.
* It is probable, therefore, that the solubility of the Phosphate of Lime Guano rock from Los Monges is owing to the presence of the Chloride of Sodium existing in it.
By reference to the analyses (II and III), it will be seen thai the Phosphate of Lime dissolved is in proportion to the Chloride of Sodium in the specimens.
This will, however, require more detailed examination.
Though the rock from Centinella containing so large a percentage of Phosphoric Acid combined with Iron and Alumina may seem at first worthless as a fertilizer, no positive opinion should be formed or expressed without a very careful investigation of the subject, which I believe has never yet been made.
It is true that Phosphate of Alumina is one of the most sparingly soluble substances known, though it is soluble in water saturated with Carbonic Acid, according to Bischof in about 6.828.000 parts, though in the water of the Carlsbad springs about double this quantity is held in solution, viz : ' t 3-125000.
Though the Phosphate of lime is applied to soils, and, as such, taken up by plants, there is no proof that it remains in that form until the plants have need of it; it enters into new combinations, some of which may be quite as insoluble as this Centinella rock.
The Phosphate of Lime dissolved by the carbonated waters always found more or less in soils, J is decomposed by alkaline carbonates : the lime would therefore be converted into a carbonate, and a phosphate of the alkali will be formed.^ Bousingault and Levy, Journ.
des Debuts, Dec. 5, 1852, found that the air in the insterstices of arable soils contained as much as 22 to 23 times as much carbonic acid as the atmosphere, and when the soil has been recently moistened 245 times as much.
Phosphate of lime lying in such a soil would be dissolved in a comparatively short space of time.
Carbonate of Iron is present more or less in every soil, and consequently if in a soil the carbonate of iron and phosphate of lime exist, both held in solution by a carbonate of the alkalies, a mutual decomposition may take place||, consequently we may have vivianite formed in the soil : instances are frequent of vivianite in fossils of the green sand of New Jersey,^ but geological ages are not required to produce these changes.

Phosphate of iron and proto-sulphate of iron form sulphate of lime and proto-phosphate of iron,) Similar changes probably result in this guano rock, as in many specimens we find crystals of gypsum recognizable with a pocket-lense.
1857.J 100 Eumont a village ia the department of LaMeurthe, the earth of which was very ferruginous, two arm bones of a female, a cubitus and a radius, having a deep bluish green color.
On breaking, the alteration was found to be complete, and a qualitative chemical examination proved it to be phosphate of iron.
It is to be regretted that a quantitative analysis was not made, to have determined whether all the bone phosphate had been decomposed and the transformation into phosphate of iron complete.
M. Nickles, on examining the medullary cavity with a lens, found among the sinuosities left by the hardened marrow brilliant points which were distinctly crystals of vivianite.
The bones were in a perfect state of preservation, and afforded, when treated with hydrochloric acid, a skeleton of gelatine, proving that gelatine does not resist the absorption of the ferruginous compound.
Various theories have been formed and published as to the origin of the rock guano ; these are most likely premature, as the accounts as to its occurrence are founded on reports of those not accustomed to noting geological phenomena.
The continued and gradual upheaval of islands in the ocean and their depression is a well established geological fact.
The islands of the Caribbean sea are very varied, some are quite low and covered with sand composed of fragments of shells, madrepore and corals, which can readily be distinguished with a pocket lens.
These sands are resorted to by myriads of waterfowls for laying their eggs.
One of the captains who visited there mentions, that it is necessary to make one's way through them with a stick.
Other islands attain heights of 800 feet ; it seems improbable that such heights could be created by accretions of guano and sand, when the islands were subject to a continued action of the waves of the ocean.
The inclination and irregularity of the guano layers renders it not improbable that the dynamic causes which produced this distortion, elevated at the same time the islands.
It is most probable that the guano rock from some of the islands has been changed in its composition by reactions of the salts contained in sea water, but before such reactions can be fully explained, accurate analyses must be made of this sea water.
It is a remarkable fact, that the composition of the ash from the recent guano from the heights of the Centinellarock composed of phosphates of alumina and iron, should have a composition so very near to that of the guano rock from the Los Monges and El Roque islands.
The frequent occurrence of alumina and iron is to be remarked in the guano rocks.
The upheaval and subsidence of land is caused not only by earthquakes, (Lyell's Principles of Geology, 8th edit.
chap, xxxi.,) but by other changes such as are in progress in Sweden and Norway, and in Greenland.
The upheaval of islands in the Caribbean Sea may most likely be ascribed lo volcanic action, some of these are within 150 miles from Gaudaloupe.
(Lyell's Principles, 33G,) von Buch inclined to the belief, that the volcanic chain of the Andes was connected with that of the West India or Caribbean Islands.
The truth of this conjecture has been almost set at rest by the eruption of the volcano at Zamba, in New Grenada, at the mouth of the river Madalena.
* The vicinity of the volcanoes may give additional salts to the sea water.
Note.
— I have just been informed by Dr. Luther, that from analyses lately made in Baltimore of a cargo of rock guano, that has lately arrived from the island of Testigoes, there has been found from forty to forty-five per cent, of phosphoric acid.

Examination of a Nickel Meteorite, from Oktibbeha County, Mississippi.
BY WM.
J. TAYLOR.
This highly interesting and unique meteorite was found in an Indian mound in which excavations were being made in a search for Indian antiquities, in Oktibbeha County, Mississippi.
It then weighed five and a quarter ounces ; in shape it resembled a hea's egg.
When found, there was a fissure which divided it almost equally into two parts.
The person who discovered it seeing this, placed it upon an anvil, and with one blow of a sledge-hammer, divided the meteorite.
One half was forged, with the intention of manufacturing it into a cutting instrument of some description ; the other remained in its original state; excepting that its exterior was filed smooth and bright.
To Dr. William Spillman, of Columbus, Mississippi, I am indebted for the material for this investigation ; he obtained the meteorite from the man who first found it.
The unforged half he brought with him on a recent visit to this city, and a portion of which he has presented to the Academy, on the condition that it should be carefully cut, so that the surface which formed one side of the existing fissure above mentioned should be preserved and sent to him.
It was proposed to have it cut by a lapidary, but he attempted it without success, usin"" diamond dust on the wheel.
On making the first incision, about oneeighth to one-sixteenth of an inch in depth, he found it impossible to proceed, and refused to make farther attempts to cut the meteorite.
Mr. John Phillips, a fellow member of the Academy, and an amateur machinist, on hearing of our difficulties, kindly offered to saw the specimen, and succeeded admirably, though it was with very great difticulty.
He spoke of its peculiar toughness, (the hard[April, ness not bcinr^ excessive ;) it resisted the saw very miuli, wliich rendered the rutting exceedingly tedious, heating the saw to such a degree as to oblige a discontinuance of the operation every four or five minutes, but it was remarkable that it did not dull the blade in the least.
The toughness of the iron was clearly shown when, for the purpose of analysis, it was attempted to cut off portions of it with a chisel ; the excessive toughness of the iron rendered this very difficult, without the aid of the saw.
The resistance of this meteorite to the action of acids was most remarkable.
Strong nitric acid did not act upon it in the cold.
Moderately dilute sulphuric acid did not act upon it.
Strong and boiling hydrochloric acid acted upon it very gradually.
The above named acids failing to show the slightest trace of the Widmannstattian figures, a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric was used, boiling ; but even after this operation no trace of them could be distinguished.
The action of the aqua regia was gradual and peculiar, producing on the polished surface of the meteorite very small holes, varying in size from a pin's point to those as large as a pin's head.
From the appearance of the surface of the meteorite, which formed a side of the fissure before described, I hud hoped to obtain by etching beautiful Wi^'mannstilttian figures, as there is on this portion indistinct traces of that which would at first glance be called a crystalline structure.
The color of the metal is a silvery grey with a pinkish tinge.
Its hardness is not excessive, yielding readily to the file.
The tensibility, as before mentioned, was very great.
The passivity was proved by testing it with a neutral solution of the sulphate of copper.
The specific gravity at 25° Cels., was found by Dr. F. A. Genth to be 6.854, which is too low, but owing to the numerous fissures through the meteorite filled with liraonite, it was impossible to obtain the exact specific gravity of the metal.
I used particular care to obtain a portion free from the flaws, but without effect.
I take this opportunity to express my thanks to Dr. Genth for allowing me the use of his laboratory in making the examination.
The following is the re?
ult of my analysis : 1.9421 grammes were dissolved in aqua regia.
1.4731 J grams.

I think is owing to some small portions of limonite existing in the minute fissures already mentioned.
The 0.10 per cent, of phosphorus correspond to 0.64 per cent, of schribersite, (P. Ni2 Fe4 .)
It was first attempted to dissolve in hydrochloric acid, but the action of the acid, even when boiling, was so very gradual that nitric acid was added.
I endeavored to separate the nickel and cobalt by Liebig's new method, viz., by precipitating the nickel as a sesqui-oxide, by passing chlorine through an alkaline solution of the two metals in hydrocyanic acid and potash, but it was found not to answer ; the separation was made by his former method by oxide of mercury.
The composition of this remarkable meteorite is in itself sufficiently interesting for mineralogists, without any attempts to account for its origin, either terrestrial or celestial.
We must remain in doubt as to the exact locality where it was originally found, as it may have been carried by the Indians from a distance to be entombed in this mound, and it may have been considered by them 1857.]
to have a special value, and possibly to possess peculiar virtues, from its being discovered in such a place.

Communications were received from Col. J. J. Abert, dated Washington, April 28, 1857, referring to a species of mocking-bird, supposed by him to be new ; and from F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, M. D., entitled '' Explorations under the War Department : Descriptions of new Cretaceous and Tertiary Fossils, collected by Dr. F. V. Haydea in Nebraska, under the direction of Lieut.

K. Warren, U. S. Top.
Engineers, with some remarks on the geology of the Upper Missouri country;" which were referred to Committees, as usual.
Mr. Lea stated that he proposed to change the name of Unio umbrosus and Unio W^heatleyi, to U. umbrans and U. Catawbensis, having inadvertently repeated these names in his papers of Feb. 17th and March 10th, 1857.
Mr. W. Parker Foulke requested permission to submit to the attention of the Academy some observations of the late Mr. Hugh Miller, printed in his recently published work, entitled " The Testimony of the Rocks."
It may be remembered, said Mr. F., that about three years ago T noticed at one of the stated meetings of the Academy, what appeared to me an interesting example of the fallacious use of a generalization — the inference from a term used in one sense, of what could follow from it only when used in another sense.
From the fact that the carboniferous rocks lie within the series which geologists, for special reasons, group into one system which they call the " palaeozoic," Mr. Miller had thought himself authorized so far to treat this system as a unity, as to consider it properly characterized as a whole, for the object of his argument, by the carboniferous member ; and thence to infer that the palaeozoic periods together constituted the Mosaic day during which the creation of vegetables took place.
No influence had been allowed to the fact that distinctive types of animal organization had been the chief motives for the discrimination between the "palaeozoic "' and "secondary" rocks as two sj^stems ; but the distinction being thus adopted by others, the author had assigned one of the systems entire to the vegetable creation, and the other to that of reptiles.
You will remember, Mr. President that, before the time to which I refer, it was a subject of private remark amongst the members of the Academy, that a large portion of the zeal and talent employed in drawing conclusions from the generalizations of discoveries in natural science, was applied to premature inferences, or in disproportionate subordination to incomplete metaphysical inquiries.
This evil was not confined to men of one pursuit, or of one school : but it affected eveiy department of " natural science," and of the abstract sciences most nearly connected with it.
In geology, as well as in ethnology, philojogy, and general natural history, we had frequent occasion to notice the conflict of unnecessary speculations, and of irrelevant or unseasonable inferences ; and the temporary withdrawal of much mental activity from the legitimate paths of scientific inquiry.
The interval is short since the investigations of our day were fairly opened ; and already the necessary subdivisions of labor are so numerous as to demand the most sedulous devotion to each.
Yet we saw laborer after laborer diverging from his road to engage upon one or another side of metaphysical controversies, which could not be finally determined except by methods [May, proper to the natural sciences ; nor even by these, unless after greater accumulation and more accurate generalization of facts than had been accomplished.
In the eagerness excited by these controversies, xve also noticed, especially in respect to such as were of a kind to attract popular attention, that there was caused a bias unfavorable to the ascertainment of fact ; and that tlie legitimate uses of actual discovery were thwarted by irregular processes, wliich for the most part were unconsciously adopted, but which were not for tliis reason the less pernicious to the progress of natural knowledge.
In these circumstances, the rationale of the methods employed by writers upon natural history or the physical sciences in general, became a peculiarly important subject for the scrutiny of the Academy ; and in formally presenting that subject, I felt assured that my propositions would serve only as the means of concentrating thoughts alreadj" entertained by the members.
To give a suitable illustration of the irregularity iu question, there were several reasons for selecting the discourse of Mr. Miller, entitled " The Two Records, the Mosaic and the Geological."
It had jast been republished in this country; its author was widely known in both hemispheres by his interesting discoveries in the old red sandstone ; and, because of his having written so as to be easily understood by persons not previously skilled in geology, his publications bad been read by probably a larger number of persons than had before undertaken the perusal of treatises on the sarac subject.
Moreover, he had written with special reference to several leading controversies which engaged the popular attention ; and his works were frequently appealed to with more or less pertinency in relation to the Noachic deluge, the origin of the varieties in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and the geographical distribution of species.
He thus served as a medium of communication between the studies of scientific men, and the speculations of the general reader.
Lastly, his character and motives were unimpeached ; and thus the force of personal considerations was added to those of learning and judgment.
I was careful, Mr. President, to announce at the outset, that what was intended in my criticism had reference to the " logic of the natural sciences ;" but under the comity proper between this Academy and the cultivators of those sciences throughout the world, it certainly did not appear to me necessary to disclaim all design to charge upon any person a wilful misuse of reasoning.
Nevertheless, as a manifestation of the feeding with which the essay of Jlr.
Miller was reviewed, I used these words, which were printed in our Proceedings : "The high esteem in which the character of Mr. Miller is deservedly held by readers in the United States, where his writings are widely circulated, and the respectful manner in which his interesting researches have occasioned his name to be mentioned by authors eminent in the department of geology, give to such of his writings as bear upon the biblical question, peculiar importance with reference to the community at large."
There was, therefore, no question proposed upon matter of fact, nor any imputation upon the motives of Mr. Miller.
My remarks obtained the general concurrence of the members who heard them ; at whose instance, and not at my own, the minute of them made by the Secretary was published with the other proceedings of the evening.
Sharing with you, Mr. President, and our fellow members, the profound sentiment produced in this country by the melancholy scenes which closed the useful life of Mr. Miller, I am sure of your participation with me in the surprise and regret with which I have read the following paragraphs, at pages 171, 172 and 173* of "The Testimony of the Rocks."
(Mr. Foulke here read the passages referred to.)
That a member of this Academy could be permitted to make, against such a man as the lamented deceased, a gratuitous charge of intentional misreprcsenta/«ow ; and that the charge could be deliberately sanctioned, and printed under your authority and that of the other distinguished gentlemen who were present at the meeting of May 9, 1854 — some of whom are now here — seems so far beyond any license known to a respectable association, that I confess myself at a loss * Boston Edition, 1857.
1857.]
106 to find aa acceptable explanation of the credence which has been given to the supposition.
I need not say, in this Hall, that the thing is impossible.
Mr. Miller is no longer among the living ; the hand of death has removed restraints ■which might have prevented the voluntary proffer of any denial of such an imputation as is implied upon me, upon you, and upon our associates, by the paragraphs which I have read to you.
I shall have your and their approval, when I give to the memory of the deceased, as a tribute of respect, the most emphatic disclaimer of any thought which could impeach the integrity of his motives in the construction of his argument; or which could attribute to him conscious neglect of the rights of others, in that most unfortunate interpretation which he has put upon the Proceedings of this body.
Having said thus much towards the dead, let me add a few words in the way of caution to ourselves.
Each of us is engaged in some pursuit which touches adversely the opinions, the prejudices, the self-love, perhaps the religious sentiment of a portion of mankind.
Even in what might appear to an uuimpassioned observer the most tranquil of occupations, there arise competitions; and the very love of truth often makes us impatient disputants.
We have seen that under a sudden sensibility to a logical criticism, not so phrased as expressly to forbid the meaning erroneously attributed to it, a stranger, with no cause of quarr *, has been supposed by an author of respectable fame to make an accusation of mendacity against him ; and a learned body of established reputation has been believed to have promoted the publication of the charge.
To a judgment thus unconsciously clouded, see how naturally all that followed became distorted.
I had said that the proceeding of the author was " a fallacious use of a generalization made for a purpose, and upon a principle not properly available for the writer's argument ;" and the author forgetting the distinction between &f(tUacii and a falsehood, and overlooking too the grammatical relation of the parts of the sentence, italicized the words " 7nade for apur2}ose" so that his readers could not avoid the suggestion that it was the '■'■fallacious use" and not the " generalization," which had been mac?e /o?
* a j9!<rjuose, inapplicable to bis object.
Nay more ; such was the effect upon the author's mind, that he closed his quotation with an "&c." at the very point at which began the sentence which I have read to you, referring to the " esteem in which he was deservedly held in the United States" — took no notice whatever of the tenor of that sentence, but said," so far the Proceedings of the Academy," &c. It need not surprise you, sir, after such examples, to find that I am said to treat the carboniferous period as the latest of the palaeozoic series.
A glance at my phraseology will be sufficient to show you that the " series" referred to was one reckoned " from the carboniferous rocks downwards, (backward in order of time,)" and that the rocks in this series were selected by me to show the inconsistency of the argument with the facts ; and that my choice had no connection with the limitation of the palaeozoic system.
That my use of the word series was not a novelty, may be easily shewn by reference to British as well as American authors.
* I have no wish to multiply these observations ; my peculiar personal interestin the misapprehensions of the author, ends with the explanation which has been made in relation to that which wounded his feelings ; yet, in illustration of the reflection to which my last remarks have been directed, it may not be improper to mention two or thi'ee additional examples.
Thus, although a member of this body, surrounded by the choice geological library through the use of which so manj^ Americans have become known abroad for learning in natural science, it is assumed that I am ignorant of the relation of the " Permian " rocks to the Palceozoic system — a relation * " The use of the word series in describing the subdivisions of the palaeozoic system, is by no means an innovation, but is, on the contrary, a return to the language formerly in very common use among tlie members of the Geological Society, as any one may see on turning over the pages of the early volumes."
Synopsis of the Classification of the British Palceozoic Rocks.
By the Rev.
Adam Sedyivick, 3L A., F. K. S., Woodwardian Professor and Felloio of Trinity College, Camhridye.
London, 1855, [May, indicated during at least twenty years in elementary treatises.
Again, although a citizen of Pennsylvania — a State one of whose most remarkable evidences of wealth is the fact that she is the holder of the great anthracite basin and of n, portion of the chief bituminous measures — although a resident of Philadelphia, whose principal domestic export is coal, it is assumed that 1 could overlook the fact that there are vast deposits of coal in North America.
It ought, perhaps, to be said in this connection, that the author has wholly misunderstood my observations with respect to tlie comparative quantities of vegetable product in the carboniferous period and that in which we live.
Considering that we do not know the extent of the area of growth in the carboniferous period, nor the length ot time consumed in forming the deposits of vegetable matter which make the coal beds ; and taking into view solidity as well as size, and the multiplication of individual growths, it is certainly not going very far to say that it is not " patent to all " that the total quantity of vegetable growth upon the earth during a given space of time was greater in the carboniferous than in the present period.
I made no affirmative assertion ; and in the absence of conclusive i^roof, I have none to make now.
It is enough to indicate the irrelevance of the reasoning employed by the author upon pages 174 and 1*75.
With respect to the scientific criticism which has occasioned these remarks, it gives me no concern.
It, or its equivalent, will be judged by proper persons.
It has been in the handsof many whose minds have been disciplined in the best methods of inquiry ; and from no quarter had I reason to suspect the existence of dissent until the appearance of the book before us.
It is to be hoped that on both sides of the Atlantic there will be cultivated a mutaal confidence, which shall prevent misconception of motives ; and that hereafter the vigilance which is indispensable to preserve the pursuits of philosophy from unconscious bias, shall not be misconstrued as the intrusion of an unfriendly spirit.
Felix quern faciunt aliena pericida cautum.
In conclusion, I beg to renew the expression of my regret, that any accident should have made me the occasion of pain to a gentleman so deserving of our consideration and friendly esteem as was the author of "The Testimony of the Rocks."
It cannot but enhance the appropriateness of such an expression at this meeting, that beside yourself and your colleague, the other Vice President, who usually preside over the deliberations of the Academy, I see here to night its venerable President, and several other learned members, whose names are familiar to cultivators of the natural sciences in Great Britain.

Mr. Harris observed, in relation to the specimens of cotton-wood and chips cut by beavers, presented this evening, that they had been obtained by him from the Missouri River, between Fort Union, at the mouth of the Yellowstone, and Fort Clark, at the Mandan Village.
He added, that in returning from a trip up the Missouri to the mouth of the Yellowstone, in company with the late J. J. Audubon and party, in the month of September, 1843, our Mackinaw boat was moored for the night on the right bank of the river, under shelter of timber on the bank, which was here about twenty feet above the water at its then 1857.]
rather low stage.
Our guide and pilot in descending the river, Prevost, who was an old trapper, hired by Mr. A. at St. Louis for the trip, soon discovered signs of the beaver, and presently a newly constructed beaver-house about one hundred yards above the boat.
It was too late to examine the premises, and after cutting wood, building a fire, and cooking our supper, we turned in for the night.
Very early in the morning, before breakfasting, we hastened to examine what had been the object of more than one expedition on the Yellowstone, and which had, heretofore, baffled our search.
Prevost assured us that the noise and smell of smoke, and cooking from our camp, must have driven the beaver to a place of safety soon after our landing the night before, and that we could only gratify our curiosity by the inspection of the building; whereas, had daylight permitted, we might, at first landing, have proceeded quietly and stopped the covered outlet from the house to the water, and thus secured the inmates, and this only by using the utmost caution in approaching without giving them the wind of us, or making the slightest noise, even the crackling of a dry twig under our feet; so religiously did he believe in their superhuman sagacity in discovering and avoiding danger.
Thus assured, I took my gun, more from the influence of the habit ofsome months of seldom stirring from camp without it, than from any expectation of seeing a beaver.
I followed the water to the outlet, while others took the bank; here I stood watching the operations of those above, who had commenced removing the branches of cotton-wood which formed the covering of the domicile.
I was startled suddenly by the splashing of the water at my feet, and, looking down, I saw the dusky back of a beaver a few inches under the surface, gliding out into the deep water of the river, and before I could prepare and bring my gun into position, he was out of sight.
Nothing could have been easier, had I been prepared, than to have shot him as he thus passed within three feet of the spot on which I stood.
Thus, from too much reliance on popular tradition of the unerring instinct of this animal, was I prevented from adding the skin, and description, and measurements of a fresh specimen of the beaver to the trophies of our expedition.
As the beaver passed down the stream he was seen to rise for air, abreast of our boat, by some of the men on board.
We then proceeded to unroof the house by removing the cottonwood branches, which covered it for several feet in thickness ; they extended for a considerable width on each side, and covered the passage from the house to the water ; this passage was about fourteen inches square, as neatly excavated as a ditcher could have made it with a spade ; it was from twenty-five to thirty feet long, following the scope of the bank, and ending some two or three feet under the water.
The branches were laid with their butts uppermost, and formed a complete thatching to the house, nearly weather-proof.
The house itself was a vertical excavation into the bank, cylindrical in form and about three and a half feet in diameter ; the slope of the bank, where it was cut, gave it the figure of a section of a cylinder of about four feet high on the side of the bank, and the heighth of the passage to the river, on the other, about fourteen inches.
The bottom and walls of this room were smooth and hard as though they had been pressed or beaten, but not plastered.
The circle was apparently perfect in form.
I should have said, it was rather more than half-way up the bank.
Prevost said that the house was unfinished, and that, before winter, the whole interior earth and brush of the sides and roof would have been neatly plastered with clay so as to render it entirely weather-proof.
The quantity of cotton-wood branches and saplings used in this structure was enormous; I suspect the measurement would have been about three cords, or as many wagon loads, and so closely impacted that it Wiis only after considerable labor that a breach was made.
On the bank above was the area of stump-land where they had felled their timber, taking what was suitable from the most convenient distance.
The large block presented this evening was cut from the largest log felled ; the branches only were taken, leaving the trunk where it fell.
Small saplings were taken entire.
The smaller piece, which is cut at both ends, was the butt of a bough or sapling, which, in their attempt to drag to the bank, had become wedged among a clump of bushes in such a manner that they could not [May, deological ^ li/iromelrical Section aJong rJip Jl7?,fOU2-J RlreT from Ft BeiHon to iJie Finite Riwr =51 S == ' " ' '^^^^'^'^^^'^^^^^~'^~''~'^''^'^^'^ ^'^^^^ r -* ' ji.
back it out again, owing to the resistance of tlie branches on the ground and of other bushes, so, like the sailor who throws overboard a portion of iiis cargo to enable him to save the rest, thej' cut oflF this piece that they might steer clear of the difficulty with the remnant of their treasure.
The chips are from the larger specimen ; in cutting them out they must work horizontally around the trunk, and when they have cut two grooves at the proper distance apart, they take hold of the isolated portion with their teeth, and split off portions vertically, and so in succession split off chips until they have girdled the tree ; a second course is then removed from the bottom of this, and so on diminishing the size of the chips until the tree is only supported by a portion of its heart connecting the apices of two cones — one on the stump upright, the other on the butt of the log inverted.
In this manner, also, the Indians cut down trees with their hatchets, leaving the same form of a cone on the but of the log and on the stump, as their beaver neighbors have done before them.

The facts from which the accompanying map and section have been constructed, are mainly the results of three years' explorations by me in the north west;* and although some of them have heretofore been given to the public in brief written accounts of the geology of that country,f this is the first time they have been presented in this form.
In regard to the Map, I would simply state that it is based on the most recent topographical explorations.
The geology, however, is of course not * The geology of portions of north-eastern Kansas has been colored on this map from information kindly furnished by Maj. F. Hawn, of Weston, Missouri, U. S. Dep.

colored with that minuteness of detail attainable where a regular geological survey has been made.
It is therefore probable outliers of the Tertiary formations may exist at a few points where the color would indicate the presence of the older strata upon which they repose.
It may also be the case that in some instances valleys have been excavated through the Tertiary so as to expose the Cretaceous strata, at a few localities near the junction of those systems which I have colored as Tertiary.
Where any of the colors end abruptly against black spaces, I merely mean to indicate that the formation is known to extend that far, without pretending to say it may not occupy a greater area in that direction.
* As meagre as this map may appear, it is hoped it will not be considered void of interest, when it is borne in mind that it represents the geology of a country about much of which comparatively little accurate information has been published, and the most conflicting opinions are entertained.
As an evidence of this, it is only necessary to state that in a comparatively recent publication issued under the sanction of the Geological Society of France, the author, with nearly all that had been published respecting the geology of this country before him, colors almost the whole of this area, which is now well known to be occupied by Cretaceous and Tertiary formations, as Triassic and Jurassic.
Respecting the section, it is perhaps only necessary for me to state, that so far as it represents a profile of the country, it has been constructed from the most reliable Barometrical measurements in the possession of the War Department.
The relative thickness of the various formations is given from careful estimates, and not from actual measurements ; it is believed, however, that they will not be found far from correct.
As a brief history of former explorations in the North West, together with descriptions of the new fossils, are given in another place in this number of the Proceedings, I shall here confine myself to a few general remarks respecting the geological formations represented in the map and section, and leave all details for another occasion.
The rocks of Nebraska Territory, so far as they have been determined, appear to be referrible to four of the great systems, viz.
: — I. Carboniferous.
III.
Tertiary.
II.
Cretaceous.
IV.
Quaternary.
That portion of Nebraska to which my attention has been directed, forms the area or basin drained by the upper Missouri river and its tributaries, but more immediately to the region bordering upon the Missouri itself, commencing at the mouth of the Platte river and proceeding thence to a jjoiut near the base of the Rocky Mountains.
System I.
— Carboniferous.
Ascending the Missouri river, we have the upper members of the Carboniferous system, or the Coal Measures, very well exposed at the mouth of the Platte, and extending up the river about fifty miles, where they dip beneath the water level of the Missouri.
At Florence, seven miles above Omaha city, the bed of the river is formed of these limestones, and this is the last exposure of them which I observed in ascending the river.
It is difficult to estimate with much accuracy the thickness of the different beds, as the yellow marl or " Bluff Formation," a recent deposit, attains a great thickness in this region, concealing the limestone except in a few localities.
* By some mistake of the persons employed in New York to color the map, the little Tertiary basin at the mouth of Judith River, and several small outliers of Tertiary near White River, are colored a much deeper yellow than the deposits of that age on other parts of the map.
A very small exposure of Cretaceous rocks on the Yellowstone, just below the mouth of Power River, was by a similar error left out.
[May, The Coal Measures, when thoroughly studied, will be found to hold an important position among the geological systems of the far West.
According to the investigations of Prof Shallow, they extend down the Missouri river to Lexington, and we may safely say that they occupy that portion of Kansas bordering upon the river,'and for a considerable distance into the interior.
We have satisfactory evidence of their existence in the vicinity of Fort Laramie, and also that they occupy a considerable area near Great Salt Lake, Utah Territory.
Little is, however, known of the geology of these for western regions ; our present information consisting for the most part of isolated facts.
System II.
— Cretaceous.
This system holds a very important position in the North West not only from the vast area which it occupies, but also in consequence of_ the number, variety, and beauty of its organic remains.
The different formations, as they appear in ascending the Missouri, hare been separated into five divisions, presenting generally well-marked lithological differences, and for the most part characterized by different species of fossils.
I shall first speak of Formation No.
1 of the Vertical Section, presuming, however, that from all the information yet obtained, its geological position is not definitely determined.
Thus far the weight of evidence seems to be in favor of its belonging to the Cretaceous System.
We will consider it provisionally, therefore, as the lowest member of the Cretaceous System in this region, and as the first of the series of beds of that age seen in ascending the Missouri.
Formation No.
1 of Vertical Section* In the order of superposition, Formation No.
1 rests directly upon the true limestones of the Coal Measures before referred to.
Its first exposure seen along the Missouri is at Wood's Bluffs, right bank, about eighty miles above the mouth of the Platte, and it dips beneath the water level of the Missouri, a few miles below the mouth of the Vermilion.
Its general character is a coarse grained, friable sandstone, very ferruginous, of a yellow or reddish yellow color, with thin beds of impure lignite aud various colored claj-.
It contains very few fossils, mostly of the genera Solm, Cyprina and Peclitnculm, also fossil wood, and numerous impressions of dicotyledonous leaves, similar to the common willow.
Its entire thickness is estimated at ninety to one hundred feet, but it may be more.
The relation which I suppose this formation holds to one of a similar character near the mouth of the Judith river will be noticed hereafter.
Formation No.
2 of Vertical Section.
This Formation is first revealed in thin outliers below the mouth of Big Sioux river, and on that stream six miles above its mouth it caps the Bluffs, apparently mingling to some extent with the succeeding bed, and containing at this locality large numbers of Inoceramus problemaiicus and fragments of fishes.
Near the mouth of Iowa creek and above, it shows itself worthy of a separate position in the series.
It is composed of a dark leaden gray laminated plastic clay, containing few fossils, but great quantities of the sulphate of lime in crystals, assuming a variety of beautiful forms.
Its greatest thickness is seen five miles below the mouth of James river.
At Dorion's Hills it is seen at low water mark.
Entire thickness estimated at ninety feet.
Fossils, Ammonites, Inoceramus, Cytheria, Serpula, Oslrea and abundant fish remains.
Formation No, 3 of Vertical Section.
The geographical distribution of this formation and its influence on the scenerjrender it one of the most interesting on the Missouri.

spicuous on the summits of the Bluffs ten miles above Iowa creek.
At Dorion's Hills it reaches to the water's edge and is the prevailing formation from thence to the foot of the Great Bend, where it passes by a gentle dip beneath the water level of the Missouri.
At Dorion's Hills there is a fine section of this bed about eighty feet exposed above the water's edge, containing its most abitndant and characteristic fossil, Ostrea congesta.
In many places, as opposite the mouth of Running Water, it assumes the form of a long series of precipitous bluffs, giving a pleasing variety to the general monotony of the scenery.
This is one of the principal characteristic external features of this formation.
The upper portions of this rock is a yellowish and gray calcareous marl, very soft and yielding, so that it is easily cut up into numerous ravines by the temporary streams, and thus the bluffs along the Missouri often present the appearance of a seriesof cones split from apex to base.
The lower stratum, however, is more com2)act and forms a soft bluish gray limestone.
Though so well developed and covering so wide an area, the middle and upper portions, at least, of this rock can never be made useful for building purposes.
Quite soft and friable in places, when detached, it absorbs moisture rapidly and crumbles in pieces.
Being a rich calcareous marl, it may be used at some future time as a fertilizer.
The fossils of this formation, though belonging to few species, so far as is yet known, are numerous in individuals.
A species of oyster (0. congesta) is found in great quantities throughout the bed, and in localities Inoceramiis problematicus is abundant.
Fish remains, though consisting mostly of scales and obscure fragments, are disseminated throughout the deposit, several species of which have already been identified and described by Dr. Leidy.
Entire thickness of this bed about one hundred and fifty feet.
Xear First Cedar island, a very singular bed makes its appearance superimposed on No.
3, which we shall consider as probably forming a local upper member of that formation.
It extends up the Missouri river to a point near the Great Bend, a distance of about eighty miles.
Lithologically it is a dull black, unctuous clay, destitute of any grit, and does not effervesce with an acid.
It contains some carbonaceous matter and great quantities of Selenite in crystals.
Formation No.
4 of Vertical Section.
This Formation is the most important one in the Cretaceous System of the North West, not only in regard to its thickness and its geographical distribution, but also in its influence on the topographical features of the country.
It is only second in interest to the succeeding bed in the number, beauty and variety of its organic remains.
Commencing about ten miles above the mouth of James river, where it is seen only in their outliers capping the distant hills or bluff's, it continues gradually assuming a greater thickness as we ascend the Missouri until reaching the Great Bend, where it monopolizes the whole region, giving to the country underlaid by it a most gloomy and sterile aspect.
At the Great Bend it attains a thickness of two hundred feet, and continues to occupy the country bordering on the Missouri to the mouth of Grand river, where, in consequence of the dip of the strata, it passes gradually beneath the water level of the river.
After dipping beneath the water level between Grand and Cannon Ball rivers, this formation again rises to the surface about thirty miles below the mouth of Milk river, (far up towards the sources of the Missouri,) by a reversed dip of the strata from beneath the northern portion of the Great Lignite Basin, as will be seen by reference to the section on the map.
Near the mouth of the Muscle Shell river it occupies the whole country for a distance of about eighty miles, and thins out upon the tops of the hills near the mouth of the Judith river.
On the Yellow Stone I observed Formation No.
4 in but one locality, about eighty miles above the mouth of that river.
It does not attain a great thick[May, nes3, and is probably a ridge left after the denudation of the Cretaceous strata previous to the deposition of the Tertiary.
Neither the Cretaceous beds, uor the Tertiary that overlie them, exhibit in this vicinity any evidences of upheaval.
The Cretaceous strata here have an extent of only about eight miles, and arc exposed only along the banks cut by the river, yet in that space they reveal the remains of marine mollusca in a profusion which I have seen in no other locality.
The whole thickness exposed on the Yellow Stone does not exceed twenty-five feet above the water level, and the distant hills on either side are composed of Tertiary beds.
At this locality the fossils show a complete blending of this and the succeeding bed, in the ascending series.
We will now return to White or Smoking Earth river below Fort Pierre, and trace this formation into the interior of tliat interesting region.
Passing up the valley of White river, we find it occupying the country bordering upon that stream for about fifty miles above its mouth.
Near this point outliers of the White river Tertiary Basin begin to cover the highland, and No.
4 is seen along the river for about twenty miles farther, when it is concealed by Tertiary strata.
The intervening country east and north east of the Bad Lands to the Shyenne river.
a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, is for the most part underlaid by this bed, except an extension of Fox Ridge, to the sources of the Teton river, which is composed of Formation No.
5 of the Vertical Section.
The extensive area drained by the Shyenne river is composed of No.
4, excepting tlie sources of a few of its tributaries.
Sage and Bear' creeks take their rise in the "White river Tertiary Basin, but flow mostly through this Formation, revealing large quantities of Cretaceous fossils.
A few small tributaries have their origin in the Fox Ridge, and Cherry river has its source in the Lignite Tertiary Basin, near the head waters of the Little Missouri.
lu summing up the extent of country underlaid by this great formation, we find that south of the Lignite Basin, it occupies an area of two hundred miles in length and one hundred in breath, or twenty thousand square miles.
North of the Great Lignite Basin, commencing at its first appearance near Milk river, we find it covering an area of two hundred miles in length and sixty in breadth, or about twelve thousand square miles.
I have been thus particular in estimating its approximate limits and extent of surface on account of its influence on the future destiny of that region.
Wherever this deposit prevails it renders the country more completely sterile than any other geological formation I have seen in the nortli-west.
We see from the above estimate that it renders barren over thirty thousand square miles of the valley of the Missouri.
The fossils of this formation are too numerous to mention in detail.
The upper and lower members appear to be exceedingly fossiliferous, while the intervening portions of considerable thickness contain only a few imperfect ,specimens of Cephalopoda and the bones oi Mosasatirus missouriensis.
The entire thickness of this formation may be estimated at about three hundred and fifty feet.
Formation No.
5 of Vertical Section.
This very interesting bed, though diff'ering lithologicallj' from the preceding one, contains many of the same species of fossils.
It is worthy, however, of a distinct position in the series, not only from its extent, thickness and difference of composition, but also from the more favorable influence that it exerts upon the country underlaid by it.
In ascending the Missouri river it first makes its appearance near the mouth of Grand river, about one hundred and fifty miles above Fort Pierre.
Near Butte aux Gres it becomes quite conspicuous, acquiring a thiclcness of eighty or one hundred feet, and containing great quantities of organic remains.
Here it forms an extension of what is called Fox Ridge, a series of high hills having a northeast and southwest course, crossing the Missouri river into Minnesota at this point.
Its north eastern limits I have not ascertained.
In its south western extension it continues for a considerable distance nearly parallel with the Missour' osses the Moreau river about 1857.]
thirty miles above its mouth, then forms a high dividing ridge between the Moreau and Shyenne rivers, at -which locality it first took its name.
Continuing thence its south westerly course, it crosses the Shyenne, and is seen again in its full thickness at the heads of Opening creek and Teton river, forming a high ridge from which tributaries of the Shyenne and Teton take their rise.
The little streams flowing into the Shyenne have a north westerly course, while those emptying into the Teton take a south easterly direction.
We thus find that this bed underlies an area of about two hundred miles in length and fifty miles in breadth, or about ten thousand square miles.
The general character of Formation No.
5 is a yellow arenaceous and argillaceous grit, containing much ferruginous matter, and in localities a profusion of Molluscous fossils.
It forms a much more fertile soil, more healthy and luxuriant vegetation, sustains a finer growth of timber than Formation No.
4, and abounds in springs of good water.
Like No.
4, this bed yields in the greatest abundance quite perfect and well preserved organic remains.
Many of the species approximate so closely to Tertiary forms, that did we not find them everywhere associated with Ammonites, Scaphites and other genera which are not known to have existed later than the Cretaceous epoch, we should at once pronounce the formation in which they occur Tertiary.
The whole thickness of this bed is estimated at one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet.
System III.
— Tertiary.
This system occupies an extensive area in the country bordering on the Missouri valley.
Its wide geographical distribution, its influence upon the topographical features of the country, the mixed and somewhat peculiar character of its organic remains, render its study of the highest interest to the geologist and palasontologist.
It seems to occupy depressions in the Cretaceous strata, as is shown in the illustrative section.
I shall speak of this sj'stem on the Upper Missouri as they occur, or as three distinct basins, the intervening portions being occupied by rocks, which, as far as has been determined, belong to the Cretaceous epoch.
The Basins of this systems are as follows : — 1st.
— Les Mauvaises Terres, or Bad Lands of White river, which with their outliers occupy an area of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty miles in length and one hundred to one hundred and fifty in bi-eadth.
Exact limits not yet ascertained.
2nd.
— The Great Lignite Basin, commencing near the mouth of Cannon Ball river and extending nearly to the mouth of the Muscle Shell river, a distance of about six hundred miles.
I have traced this formation up the Yellow Stone to the mouth of the Big Horn river, a distance of three hundred miles.
Its limits have not been ascertained in several directions.
Zrd.
— The Bad Lands of the Judith river, which occupy an area of forty miles in length and fifteen to thirty in breadth, reposing upon a sandstone, the age of which has not been positively determined.
Basin \st.
— Bad Lands of White River.
This most remarkable lacustrine deposit has been comparatively but recently made known to the scientific world.
Wondierfnl not alone for its unique scenery, but also for the abundance and importance of its organic remains.
Even as yet it has been but partially explored, and yet the results that have been obtained have proved of the highest interest.
The profusion of Mammalian and Chcloniau remains contained in this deposit of species and in most cases genera, though closely allied yet differ from all known living forms, which must render it, when fully explored and studied, classic ground to the geologist and pal;^ontologist.
A history of the progress of its exploration up to 1853, with elaborate descriptions of many of its organic remains, may be found in a magnificent memoir entitled " The Ancient Fauna of Nebraska," written by t'rof.
Joseph Leidy, and published by the Smithsonian Institution.
[May, la their lithological characters these deposits differ very materially from those of the two succeeding basins, being composed of Avhitish clays and calcareous and siliceous marls and grits, and entirely destitute, so far as known, of any vegetable remains, except very rare fragments of silicified wood.
It is chiefly remarkable as being a vast deposit in which were entombed immense numbers of Mammalian and Chelonian animals, for the beauty and perfection with which their bones have been preserved, and its unique scenery.
The few Molluscous fossils which have been found, show most conclusively its purely fresh water origin, being confined to the genera Ilclix, I'lanorbis, Limnea, c^-c. We have also at this time very conclusive evidence that it belongs to the Miocene age.
* The main body of the Bad Lands of White river covers an area of about one hundred miles in length and fifty to sixty in breadth, and it is that portion chiefly which is represented on the map.
We have satisfactory evidence, however, from its outliers, that it once occupied a very much larger area, and that it has been removed by denudation.
In the section it is represented l)y Big Ox and Medicine Hills, these localities revealing the only indications of it along the Missouri river.
We have also evidence of its existence to a greater or less extent throughout the valley of the Running Water, also that it covers large portions of the country bordering upon the Platte, especially on its North Fork, and a much larger space might be colored on the map, but we have preferred to let it represent what is now known with considerable precision, and wait for the results of future labors to render our knowledge more complete.
Basin 2nd.
— Great Lignite Deposit.
This basin occupies a more extensive geographical area on the Missouri than that of the other two united.
It has been known since the expedition of Lewis and Clark that a vast formation existed on the Upper Missouri, containing Lignite, &c. Information of a like nature has been published by former explorers since that time, but without details of its lithological characters or collection of its fossils that would enable us to determine its age or extent.
The collections of fossils now obtained show most conclusively that it possesses the mixed character of a fresh water and estuary deposit, and that it cannot be older than the Miocene period.
It is composed mostly of clays, sands, sandstone and lignites, and has already yielded numerous animal as well as vegetable fossils of great perfection and beauty.
It is chiefly remarkable, however, for the evidence that it reveals to us of the variety and luxuriance of the flora of that period.
In this respect it differs more especially from the other two deposits.
The extent of country known to be occupied by this basin I have estimated at four hundred miles in length and one hundred and fifty in width, or about sixty thousand square miles.
We thus come to an approximate idea of the immense area occupied by this formation, though I am satisfied that when it is thoroughly studied it will be found that the above estimate is much too low.
Basin 3rd.
— Bad Lands of ike Judith.
This exceedingly interesting deposit occupies a depression in a sandstone formation which rises to the water level at the mouth of Little Rocky Mountain creek from beneath the well-known Cretaceous bed No.
4 of the Vertical Section.
It presents perhaps the most rugged scenery on the Missouri river, the denudation and erosion having been much greater than at the Bad Lands of * See a paper by Prof. Leidy in the Proceedings of the Academy for March, 1857, also the succeeding paper by F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, in this number of the Proceedings.

AVhite river.
But the most remarkable feature of this basin is the wonderful disturbance of the strata.
So much are the beds disturbed and blended together by forces acting from beneath, that it seems almost hopeless to obtain a section showing with perfect accuracy the order of superposition of the different strata.
The lignite beds throiighout this basin, though well marked, are of so earthy a character as to have ignited spontaneously in but few places.
Indeed the impurity of the lignite forms the most essential lithological difference between this deposit and the Great Lignite Basin below Fort Union.
In some places metamorphic rocks have been thrown up through the entire thickness of the strata.
Some remarks upon the age of this deposit will be found in a succeeding paper by F. B. Meek and the writer.
Formation No.
1 ?
of tee General Section, As seen near the mouth of Judith river.
Although the formation of which I am about to speak has already revealed many important facts, the organic contents of its strata differ so materially from those of any other with which I am acquainted in the North West, that we are unable to fix with certainty its position in the geological scale.
From its lithological characters we may refer it to No.
1 of Vertical Section, no difference being seen more than would be expected from their widely separated geographical positions.
These facts have already been published in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, from which I extract the following paragraph :* " In our section of the Nebraska formations, given in a paper published in the 8th vol.
of the Proceedings of the Academy, page 63, it will be remembered we placed provisionally the beds of sandstone and clay composing formation No.
1, seen at the Mouth of Big Sioux river and below there, along with the Cretaceous strata, stating at the same time that they were not positively known to belong to that system.
We still think it barely possible these beds may be older than Cretaceous, though if represented, as we think they are, by similar beds seen holding about the same position near the mouth of Judith river, far up towards the sources of the Missouri, we must either refer them to the Cretaceous system, or admit the introduction of the genus Baculites before that epoch, as we have fragments of a small species of that genus from the Judith river beds.
At the same time it should be borne in mind that these strata at the last named locality are characterized by a group of fossils remarkably distinct from those in the rocks above, and that one species belongs to the genus Ilettangia, a type of bivalves, not known to occur, in the old world, in more modern formations than those of the age of the Lias.
If not older than Cretaceous, we think, from these facts, as well as from the stratigraphical position of these beds, they probably represent some of the oldermembers of that system."
Although all our information as yet obtained respecting this sandstone formation is obscure, we have indications that when thoroughly studied, it will prove one of the most important and widely distributed in the far West.
From all the evidence I can obtain after a careful study and compai'ison of these beds, with the minute descriptions of Sir John Richardson, and still later those of Mr. Isbister, I am led to believe, with some confidence, that this formation is but a southern extension of the great lignite formations mentioned by those gentlemen as stretching along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, far northward to the Arctic sea.
Though, as suggested in a former paper by Mr. Meek and me, some of these lignite deposits in the north western portions of the British possessions may belong to the Tertiary epoch.

BY P. B. MEEK and P. V. HAYDEN, M. D. (Communicated by permission of the Secretary of War.)
Most of the fossils, and many of the notes and memoranda upon -which this paper is based, although collected previous to the presentation of our last communication to the Academy, arrived in the States since that paper was in print.
Consequently, we have now not only the means of adding many new and interesting species to the list of ancient moUusca previously knoAvn from Nebraska, but the late explorations of Lieut.
Warren have also brought to light some additional information in regard to its general geology, which we have embodied in the following remarks.
Before presenting these facts and conclusions, justice to former explorers requires that we should at least give a brief statement of the results of such expeditions as have contributed to the development of the geology of this region.
The first reliable accounts we have of the general physical characters of the upper Missouri country, were given to the world in the report of Lewis and Clark's expedition to the Columbia in 1804—5—6.
The explorations of these gentlemen, in addition to bringing out a large amount of information of a different character, established the fiict of the occurrence of Cretaceous rocks at the Great Bend of the Missouri below Fort Pierre, and of the existence of what was supposed to be " stone coal" (Lignite,) in the Mandan country.
Various beds of clay, sand, sandstone, &c., were mentioned in their report, but without any suggestions respecting their age.
In 1832, the Prince of Neu Wied and party also ascended the Missouri to its sources ; and the results of his explorations, embodying a great amount of highly interesting information respecting the geography, natural history, &c., of the country explored, has been published in the form of a large quarto volume, accompanied by a magnificent folio atlas of plates, illustrating the scenery of the country, and the manners and customs of its native tribes, in a style of art rarely equalled on this side of the Atlantic.
Respecting the geology of the country, however, the Prince's expedition added little of importance beyond the discovery of Mosasaurus Missouricnsis, to the results of Lewis and Clark's expedition.
* Mr. Nicollet, the well known Geographer, visited this country in 1839, ascending the Missouri to Fort Pierre, and making on his way up a fine collection of Cretaceous fossils at the Great Beud.f Although passing rapidly through the country, he formed a tolerably correct idea of its geology, and gave in his report a vertical section of the Cretaceous rock seen below Fort Pierre, which is correct, excepting that he seems to have had no knowledge of No.
2, and as we think, without sufficient reason, represented two of the subdivisions of No.
3 as distinct formations ; No1 he appears to have referred to the carboniferous system.
As he did not go above Fort Pierre, he probably Saw nothing of No.

9 la 1843, Mr. Edward Harris, who accompanied the distinguished Ornithologist Audubon to the mouth of Yellowstone River, brought back specimens from various localities along the Missouri River, some of which verified the statements of former explorers, while others gave evidence of the existence of a freshwater formation near Fort Union.
At various times after this, specimens of mammalian remains were brought iu by gentlemen connected with the American Fur Company, indicating the existence of an interesting tertiary deposit on White River; the first account of which was published by Dr. H. A. Prout, of St. Louis, in the American Journal of Science, 1847.
In 1849, Dr. John Evans, one of Dr. Owen's assistants in the geological survey of the Chippeway Land District, was sent by that gentleman on an expedition to the Mau,vaises Terres of White River, and brought back a fine collection of Mammaliaa and Chelonian remains, which w^re investigated by Prof. Leidy, of Philadelphia.
He also collected at the Great Bend, Sage Creek, and Fox Hills, many interesting Cretaceous fossils, which were investigated by Dr. D. D. Owen, and published in his final report in 1852.
Dr. Evans' observations, embracing a section of the Bad Lands, together with a deseription of their physical features, were also published in this report.
In the following year Mr. Thaddeus A. Culbertson visited the Upper Missouri country under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, during which expedition he collected some interesting vertebrate remains from the White River formations.
He also ascended the Missouri on the Fur Company's boat to a point above Fort Union, noting the character of the face of the country, and the occurrence of lignite beds at various localities.
In the spring of 1853, Dr. Evans again visited this country incidentally, while on his way to Oregon Territory, in the geological survey of which he was engaged, uuder the patronage of the general government.
During this expedition he made another extensive collection of vertebrate remains, and some freshwater mollusca at the Bad Lands of White River, as well as some interesting Cretaceous fossils from Sage Creek.
The mammalian remains of this expedition were studied by Prof. Leidy, and the other fossils by Dr. Evans and Dr. Shumard, and published in the Proceedings of the Acad.
Nat.
Sc.
at Philadelphia, and the Acad.
Sciences of St. Louis.
At the same time (1853) the writers of this paper were employed by Prof. James Hall, of Albany, N. Y., to visit the Bad Lands of White River, for the purpose of making a collection of the Tertiary and Cretaceous fossils of that region.
This expedil^ion brought back an extensive and interesting collection of vertebrate remains from the Bad Lands, and of Cretaceous fossils from Sage Creek, as well as from the Great Bend and other localities along the Missouri below Fort Pierre.
The first were investigated by Prof. Leidy, and published in the Proceedings of the Acad.
Nat.
Sc.
at Philadelphia; and the latter by Prof. Hall and one of the writers,* and published in the Transactions Acad.
Arts and Sciences, Boston.
In this latter paper a brief vertical section of the rocks seen during the expedition, and a complete list of all the mollusca then known from the Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks of that country, were given.
The fact that the fossils characterizing the Cretaceous formations of Texas and New Mexico belong to different types from those occurring in the northwest, was also in this paper made known for the first time, in the following words : "Among all the collections made in Texas by Dr. Roemer and others, and of all those brought by the , Boundary Survey Expedition, and other surveying and exploring parties, which we have seen, there is but a single species which we regard as doubtfully identical with one from Nebraska.
This is Inoceranms Barabini, Morton, (I. Crispii, Mantell (?)
)."
A summary of the leading results of this expedition, throwing light upon *Mr. Meek.
[May, the general geology of the country, its soil, scenery, &c., was likewise given to the public by Prof. Hall, in an interesting paper read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at the Providence meeting.
Subsequent to all these expeditions, one of the writers* again visited Nebraska, and spent two years in traversing various portions of that country ; part of which time he was aided by Col. A. J.

During this expedition he explored the Missouri to the vicinity of Fort Benton, and the Yellow Stone to the mouth of Big Horn River.
Also considerable portions of the Bad Lands of White river, and other districts not immediately bordering on the Missouri.
The vertebrate remains collected by him, as may be seen by reference to the various papers by Prof. Leidy in the Proceedings of the Academy, embrace a larger number of species than all those previously known from that country, many of which belong to new and remarkable genera.
Large collections of mollusca were also obtained from the Cretaceous and Tertiary formations, and have since been published by us, together with remarks on the general geology of the country, in a series of papers in the Proceedings of the Academy Nat.

Again, in 1856, the same one of the writers returned to that country in connection with a government expedition under the direction of Lieut.
G. K. Warren.
The new Cretaceous and Tertiary invertebrate remains, together with the new facts in regard to the geology of the country, collected by this expedition, form the basis of this paper.
Up to the publication of our first paper, about fifty-six new species of Cretaceous and Tertiary mollusca had been published from Nebraska, by Drs.
Morton, Owen, Evans and Shumard, and by Prof. Hall and one of the writers.
Since that time, sixteen additional new species have been published by Drs.
Evans and Shumard, making in all seventy-two species hitherto published by others from that country.
Our own investigations (including those here described) have made known one hundred and fifty new species, and two new genera, many of the former of which also belong to types not hitherto recognized in this country.
Of these one hundred and fifty species, fifty-four (if we include the Judith River, freshwater and estuary species) belong to the Tertiary system, and ninety-six to the Cretaceous.
Fifty of the Tertiary species belong to fresh water and land types, and four to genera inhabiting salt and brackish waters ; being about four-fifths of all the land and freshwater Tertiary species hitherto made known from American formations.
The geological position, and vertical range of all our new species, and several of those published by others from the north-west, as well as a number of the well known and widely distributed forms such as Scaphites Conradi, Ammonites lobatvs, A. placenta, Nautilus Dekayi, Inoceramiis problemaiicus, Mosasaurus Missotiriensis,f ^c.,have been determined with considerable accuracy ; so that we have now the means of tracing out the parallelism between these deposits and their equivalents in other countries.
In a general vertical section of the Nebraska formations given in a paper communicated by us to the Academy in November last, it will be remembered, we represented the White river Tertiary formations as on a parallel with the Eocene, or oldest member of that system.
In doing this we merely followed the published views of others, without intending to give it as the expression of an opinion based on any of our own investigations : as all the organic remains yet found in that basin, with the exception of a few freshwater shells described by * Dr. Hayden.
tin a section of the Nebraska formntions accompanying the last paper communicated by us to the Academy, we gave as the position in which the remains of Mosasnurus occur in the north west, the upper part of No.

This was in consequence of erroneoui infonnanon in regard to the locality from which the specimens given to the Prince of Neu Wied were obtained.
The locality (at the Great Bend of Missouri) has since been visited by one of us, and many specimens obtained ; they occupy a horizon about the middle of No.

1857.]
Drs.
Evans and Shumard, belong to the vertebrata, and are consequently oat of our line of investigation.
During the later explorations in that region, facts were observed tending to throw doubt upon the conclusion that these formations belong to the Eocene epoch.
Among other facts of this nature, we would mention that a friable sandstone seen crowning some of the hills near Moreau River, in which specimens of a Cyrena described in one of our former papers (6'.
Moreauensis) and Ostrea sublrigonalis (E. & S.,) were found associated with large bones supposed to be those of Titanotherium^ and which bed we had regarded as probably a distant outlier of the White river formations, was found to be the same as the lowest bed of the Great Lignite basin extending far to the northward.
Now as the Tilanotherium bed of the White river basin is the oldest member of that series, it must be manifest if the species of the Tilanotherium occurring Rt these two localities are really identical, we must either admit the remains of that animal had a great vertical range, which is not the case in the White River deposits, or suppose these two basins are nearly or quite exactly on a parallel.
In addition to the foregoing, some Miocene deposits seen crowning the summits of hills on the east side of the Missouri, near the mouth of White River, were traced by a series of outliers up the valley of the latter stream, to where they were found to pass into the upper part of the well known Mauvaises Terres, extending towards the sources of that stream, and which have furnished so many interesting vertebrate remains.
After comparing and discussing these facts we suspected that the whole of the White River basin might be more properly of Miocene than Eocene age, and upon glancing over D'Orbigny's tables showing the vertical range of the various genera of fossil vertebrata, and consulting Picktets Traite de Palceontologie, we observed that several of the old genera to which Dr. Leidy refers the White River Mammalia are regarded in the Old World as characteristic of the Miocene epoch.
These enquiries, however, being out of our line of investigation, we wrote Prof. Leidy, the distinguished comparative anatomist of Philadelphia, who has so ably investigated all the vertebrate remains hithert<^> brought from Nebraska, stating our doubts and suspicions respecting the age of these deposits, and requesting him to examine very carefully the large waterworn bones from Moreau and Grand Rivers, occurring in what we knew to be the lowest bed of the Lignite basin, and to inform us if he was quite satisfied they are identical with Titanotherium Prouti ; also making enquiries respecting the Eocene or Aliocene affinities of the various new genera of Mammalia described from the Bad Lands of White River by him.
Since that time we were much gratified to learn from Prof. Leidy that as much as three or four weeks previous to the reception of our letter, he had arrived at the conclusion, from purely palasontological evidence, that the White River deposits must belong 1« the Miocene epoch.
Prof. Leidy has presented his views in regard to the Miocene affinities of the vertebrata from the White River formations, in some interesting remarks accompanying a complete catalogue of all the organic remains described by him from Nebraska, recently read before the Academy ; a copy of which he has kindly placed in our hands in advance of the regular issue of the Proceedings.
From these remarks we extract the following in reference to the fossils from the Wliite River basin : " Oreodon, Agriochoerus Pcebroiherium, Leptomeryx, Leptauchenia, Protom&ryx^ Merycodus Titanotherium, Leptochaerus, Hyracodon, Merychippus, Ischyromys, PaImolagits, Eumys, Dinictis and Leptarctus, are peculiar, extinct mammalian genera, from the Tertiary formations of Nebraska, which have heretofore been generally viewed as belonging to the Eocene period, but from their affinities, the associated genera, and the absence of others so common in the Eocene deposits of Europe, I suspect rather belong to the Miocene period.
The first seven genera above mentioned are true ruminants, with teeth constructed upon the same type [May, a3 those of living ruminants ; a type which is not found in the Tertiary deposit.^ of Europe and Asia, earlier than the Miocene period.
Entelodon Palceochcerus, Rhinoceros, llipparion, Sleneojiber, Amphicyon, and Mackairodus, are common to the Nebraska Tertiary deposits and to the Miocene and later Tertiary deposits of Europe ; and they have not been found in the Eocene formations of the latter continent.
Of tlie genera Anchitherium, ITyopotamus and Hymnodon species are found common to the Nebraska Tertiary deposits and the European Eocene and Miocene deposits.
Remains of P.rloiolherium, Anoplothrrium and Lophiodon, so common in the Eocene formations of Europe, are entirely absent from the Nebraska Tertiary formations.
Titanotherium of Nebraska most nearly approaches the Miocene Chaliocotherium of Europe and Asia.
The rodents hchyromys, -Palmolagus and Eumys, most closely approach the Arctomyx, Lrpus and Muh of European Miocene and later deposits.
Very numerous remains of Tcstudo are found in association with the Nebraska Tertiary mammals ; and extinct species of the same genus belong generally to the Miocene and later deposits of Europe."
From all the foregoing facts, the Miocene age of these White River formations may, we think, be regarded as established, both by paloeontological and stratigraphical evidence.
There are, however, many points of interest in regard to the exact parallelism of these deposits with those of the Great Lignite basin, yet unsettled.
If it be true that the large bones previously referred to in both basins, do really belong to the same species of animal, it would seem, from the fact that they occur in the lowest bed of each, that the two basins are not merely both Miocene, but exactly on a parallel.
If so, it is very difficult to account for the fact that, out of the numerous organic remains hitherto found in the two deposits, not a single species, excepting Titanotherium Prouti* should be common to both ; especially when we bear in mind the fact that the two basins approach to within forty or fifty miles of each other.
It is true, several of the Mollusca occurring in the bone bed, or lowest stratum of the Lignite basin, belong to genera only found in salt or brackish waters, and that none but terrestrial and fresh-water types have yet been found in any part of the White River deposits ; thus indicating that one is a lacustrine formation, and the other an estuary deposits ; conditions, it is true, not very favorable to the existence of the same species of mollusca, but hardly sufficient, we think, to account for the fact that all the shells hitherto collected from the lignite formations are not merely different species from those described by Drs.
Evans and Shumard, from the White River beds, but belong to slightly different types.
The entire absence, so far as we yet know, of the fossil plants occurring in such great abundance in the Lignite formations, in those of the White River basin, is also worthy of note ; while the lithological differences between the two deposits are well marked.
The latter point of difference will be more obvious on comparing the following section of the Lignite formations taken by one of U3,f at a locality thirteen miles above Fort Clark, on the right bank of the Missouri, with the section of the Bad Lands of White River, as given by Dr. Evans in Dr. Owen's Report, page 200.
* Since the«e remarks were communicated to the Academy, we have been informed by Prof. Leidy that he now rather suspects the large bones here alluded to belong to a huge Dinosanrian described by him from these beds, under the name of Thespesius.
He further states that he had merely referred them provisionally lo Titanotherium Prouti.
from their great size, as none of them he has yet seen show even the articulating extremities.

At these latter localities it is seen to repose directly upon No.
5, or the most recent member of the Cretaceous system of the north-west, the upper part of which it so nearly resembles in iis lithological characters that ihe line of demarkation betweeu the two can often be only ascertained by the organic remains characterizing: each.
This fact, together with the general resemblance of many of the fossils found in the upper part of No.
5 of our general section to Tertiary types, would have caused us to doubt the propriety of referring this part of that bed to the Cretaceous epoch, were it not for the presence of Scaj)hites Conradi, and other well marked Cretaceous forms.
From the estuary character of the fossils found in the bed Q of the last section, {Ci/rena, Oslrca, Melania, &c.,) and the absence of Cretaceous forms, we think there can be little room to question the propriety of referring it to the Tertiary system.
The question, however, in regard to its exact position in that system may yet be regarded as a little doubtful, but the weight of evidence is on the side of the conclusion tliat it is Miocene.
This conclusion is also borne , out or strengthened by the general relations at other localities between this bed and those above, in which Miocene fossils occur.
The preceding section, although not representing all the beds of the great Lignite basin, (there being some higher beds seen at other localities,) gives a correct idea of the composition and general structure of these deposits,* and shows how remarkably they differ in their lithological characters from those of the White River basin, in which fine white argillaceous material so largely predominates, and no lignite or remains of plants have been found.
Of the age of the fresh-water and Estuary deposits seen near the mouth of Judiih River, we have refrained from the expression of any very decided opinion, in consequence of the fact that they appear to be mingled by upheavals with a series of sandstones, clays, lignite, &c., which we think belong to the same epoch as No.
1 of our general section.
Amongst some of the collections investigated by us from these Judith River estuary and fresh-water beds, and published in one of our former papers, we found species of Faludina, Corbula, &c., so closely related to shells we had from the Great Lignite basin near Fort Clark, that we were for a time in some doubt about the propriety of considering them distinct.
In this upper member of the Judith River formations, great numbers of a small oyster occur along with the fresh-water shells of which we have just spoken.
This oyster so nearly resembles a species in our possession from the lowest bed of the last section, obtained at a locality near Grand River, that we have not yet seen any characters by which they can be distinguished.
We are also inclined to reg.ird these shells as identical with a sjjecies described by Drs.
Evans and Shumard from Grand River, under the name of 0. subtriyonalis.
There is also, in the fresh-water beds at the Judith localities, a Unio, which we think the same as a shell found in the Miocene lignite formations on the Yellow Stone.
In addition to these facts, a species of Trionyx described by Dr. Leidy, from about the middle bed of the Judith fresh-water deposits, is regarded by that gentleman as identical with specimens from the bed Q, near Long Lake below Fort Clark.
Now as this bed Q, of the previous section at the Moreau, Grand River, and Long Lake localities, beyond all doubt, rests directly upon formation No.
5 of the general section, and forms a part of the Great Lignite series, we would not for a moment hesitate in regarding the deposits of which we have spoken, near the Judith, as Tertiary, were it not for the fact that the saurian and fish remains occurring in these beds, as may be seen by reference to Prof. Leidy's remai-ks respecting them, are allied to Wealden and older types.
In the midst of evidence of such a conflicting nature, it is of course unsafe to express any very positive opinion respecting the age of these formations.
At *It should be borne in mind, however, that the beds of lignite represented in this section vary much in extent, as well .
s in purity, at different localilies; some of those seen on the Yellow Stone being as much as seven feet in thickness.
At Fort Berihold.
on the Missouri, a two foot bed is pure enough to be used as fuel.
1857.]
,24 the same time, as we are strongly inclined to the conclusion that they will prove not merely Tertiary, but about of the age of the lowest beds of the Great Lignite basin, or perhaps a little older, we have therefore placed them provisionally along with the Tertiary beds in the accompanying general section of the Nebraska rocks.
In order to give some idea of the nature and order of superposition of the beds of which we have just been speaking, as well as for the sake of comparison with those of the Great Lignite basin, we give below a section taken at the mouth of Judith River, where these beds are least disturbed, and their stratagraphical arrangement can be best seen.

Alternations of impure lignite and yellowish-brown clay, the latter containing great numbers of Unio^ Faludina, Melania, Cyclas, and the fresh remains referred by Dr. Leidy to the genus Lepidotus.
G 100 feet.
Ferruginous sand and clay, having in upper part a seam 3 or 4 inches in thickness, nearly made up of shells of Unio.
Lower part ferruginous, and coarse gray grit, with a scam near the base entirely composed of remains of Unio Danai, U. Dewyi and U. subspatulata.
This section embraces all the deposits, as we believe, seen in the Bad Lands of the Judith, in which land and fresh-water shells are known to occur.
They appear, as near as could be ascertained, to occupy a local basin in a series of [May, marine deposits, consisting of beds of sandstone and impure lignite, wliich we have regarded provisionally as of the age of No 1 of our general section.
Lower down the Missouri, near the mouth of Little Rocky Mountain Creek, this last mentioned series of rocks upon which the fresh-water deposits repose at the mouth of the Judith, is clearly seen to pass beneath No.
4 of the general section ; proving that Nos.
2 and 3 are not represented in that part of the country.
As no indications were seen in this region of these latter formations, it is probably they are entirely wanting towards the sources of the Missouri.
The deposits above alluded to, (at the mouth of Judith River,) as probably on a parallel with beds seen near the mouth of Big Sioux River on the Missouri, — (forming No.
1, of the Nebraska section,) — are characterized, as stated in one of our former papers, by a group of fossils remarkably distinct from those occurring in any of the higher north western formations ; and there remains some doubt as to whether or not they are older than Cretaceous.
The presence of the genus Baculites would seem to establish the fact that they belong to the Cretaceous epoch ; while the occurrence in the same hand specimens with these remains of Baculites, of a species of Hettangii, — a genus of bivalves, not known to occur in the old world in newer formations than the Lias, — would, on the other hand, indicate that these beds are older than Cretaceous.
For the preseijt, however, we express no decided opinion on this point, but content ourselves with the remark, that we are inclined to think they hold a position near the base of the Cretaceous system, and are probably on a parallel with the Neocomien of the old world, though they may be older.
The following section, taken near the mouth of Judith River,* will exhibit approximately the lithological characters, and orderof succession of these deposits at that locality.
It is not pretended, however, that this section represents all the beds of this series, as others were observed near them, but owing to the distortion and disturbance of the strata, and the unfavorable circumstances under which the observations were made, it was impossible to devote time enough to their examination to collect the means of constructing a connected general section of the whole series.
We should also state here that the specimens furnishing the data upon which this section, and that of the fresh-water and estaary deposits near the same locality, were constructed, although collected some time back, only came to hand since the communication of our last paper.

— Mixed pure and impure lignite — whole bed containing many crystals of selenite, and a yellowish substance like sulphur.
The masses of lignite, when broken, reveal in considerable quantities small reddish crystalline fragments of a substance having the taste and appearance of rosin... 6 to 8 ft. " C. — Variable strata of drab clay, and gray sand and sandstone : — upper part containing large numbers of Oslrea glabra.
Near the middle, there are gray or ash-colored clavs with very hard bluish gray granular, siliceous concretions, containing Hcttangia Americana, Panopcea occidenlalis, Mactra formosa, <f-c., 80 to 100 ft. At several points near the locality where the above section was taken, the bed G, of the last section, with its characteristic fossils, was seen superimposed upon the bed A, of the section here given ; but the line of junction was not sufficiently well exposed to determine very satisfactorily whether the upper part of these lower deposits bears marks of denudation previous to the deposition of the overlying freshwater and estuary beds or not.
On a former occasion we expressed very briefly our views in regard to the parallelism of the Cretaceous formations of Nebraska with those of New Jersey, Alabama, and portions of the far west and south west.
In order to make more clear some of these pointj of parallelism, we here reproduce for comparison, with some modifications, the general section of the Nebraska formations ; and 1857.]

By comparing the foregoing sections with the following general section of the Nebraska rocks, tlie parallelism between the formations, so far as the Cretaceous rocks of the North West are represented in Alabama and New Jersey, will be at once understood.
In the following section of Nebraska rocks it will be observed we have placed together all the Tertiary deposits known to us, without intending to express any opinion in regard to the comparative ages of these formations.
We have also written in the column opposite them the word "Miocene;" this, so far as the Judith River fresh water and Estuary formations are concerned, is done provisionally.
We have likewise made three subdivisions of formation No.

This latter change is made mainly upon lithological ditferences between what we regard as probably subordinate members of the same formation.
The upper or dark bed of very fine argillaceous matter, passes both downwards, and at some points, horizontally into the gray marl below it, and appears to be local, while the gray marl, in its turn, passes imperceptibly into the light colored limestone below.

[May, The position and vertical range of such fossils as are known to be common to the North West and New Jersey, in the foregoing general section of the Nebraska rocks, clearly establishes, as stated in our paper communicated to the Academy in November last, that formations No.
4 and 5 of the North West, are on a parallel with the beds b. c. d. and e. of the New Jersey serief.

5 of Nebraska, and that No.
4 of the latter region is on a parallel with the beds c. d. and e. of New Jersey.
At the same time the identity of No.

It is true tbig latter opinion rests mainly upon stratigraphical and lithological evidence, yet these points of analogy are so strong as to possess great weight.
In order that this may be better understood and appreciated, we quote below from notes taken by one of us''*' in 1855, a description of an exposure of No.
1 seen on Big Sioux River, which will show, by comparison with the New Jersey section, the striking resemblance between the beds holding a position at the base of the Cretaceous formations at these distantly separated localities. "
Six miles above the month of Big Sioux River we have an exposure of impure lignite about 12 inches in thickness, underlaid by alternate layers of sandstone, loose clay, yellow and ash colored arenaceous clays, and fine whitish clay.
The strata containing clay have quite distinct impressions of leave?.
which appear to have belonged to dicotyledonous trees.
We have also, near the base of the exposure, some fine impressions of leaves in dark tough gray, siliceous, concretionary rock.
Much pyrites and fragments of fossil wood occur in these beds."
The points of analogy between these lower deposits (No.
1) of the norih-weet, and formation f at the base of theNew Jersey section, as well as with an extensive series of deposits holding the same position in Alabama, (formation E of the Alabama section,) and throughout a great area of country in Arkansas, Tesae, and New Mexico, will be more fully illustrated by the following section taken in north-eastern Kansas, where this series appears to be more extensively developed than at any localities known to us in Nebraska.
For this section, as well as much other interesting and important information respecting the geology of the country surveyed by him, we are indeb'ed to the kindness of Major F. Hawn, formerly of the geological survey of Missouri, but now connected with the lineal survey of portions of Kansas Territory.
We give it exactly as communicated to us by him, excepting that we have thrown it into a tabular form, and added columns showing the parallelism of the beds with those of New Jersey and Nebraska.
To those acquainted with Major Hawn, it is unnecessary for us to say he is a careful conscientious observer, whose statements are worthy of the fullest confidence.
The beds represented in this section were not all seen at any one locality, but their thickness, composition and order of succession were determined from examinations made at numerous exposures in the country east of the sixth principal meridian, between the northern boundary of Kansas and the Republican fork of Kansas River.

The similarity between the beds from c. to 1. inclusive, of the above section, and formation f. of the New Jersey series, when taken in connection with their position in relation to the higher formations, is too obvious to leave much room to doubt that they belong to the same horizon.
Mr. Henry Pratten, of the Geological Survey of Illinois, to whose liberality we are indebted for a full abstract of notes taken by him on the geology of the country along the California trail between Fort Leavenworth and San Francisco, informs us that he met with the lower members of the Nebraska section at several points along Platte River, above Fort Laramie.

)* Mr. Hawn writes us, he has been informed by an intelligent Deputy Surveyor, that the formations represented in his section, especially the beds below the upper limestone, were seen by him at intervals along the sixth principal meridian, as far south as his survey extended, or to the fifth standard parallel, near the Arkansas River.
Exactly similar deposits were observed by Dr. George B. Shumard in the vicinity of Fort Washita, and the Cross Timbers in northern Texas.
He describes these formations as consisting of " grayish yellow sandstone, with intercalations of blue, yellow and ash colored clays, and beds of white and bluishwhite limestone.
The limestone reposing on the clays and sandstones."
(See Capt.
Marcy's report of Explorations on Red River, page 181.)
In one of the upper beds of this series Dr. Shumard found, along with several new species of Cretaceous fossils, some of the same shells collected by Dr. Roemer from similar depv.sits at New Braunfels, and other localities further south in Texas.
He likewise collected from the same beds, species identical with some of those found in the same position by Mr. Marcou at Pyramid Mountain, in New Mexico, thus establishing the parallelism of the formations at all these localities.!
A section of these deposits taken by Mr. Marcou at Pyramid Mountain, near the Llano Estacado, (Bulletin Geol.
Soc.
France, Tome 12, p. 878,) corresponds remarkably in its general features with Mr. Hawn's section already given, of these formations in north-eastern Kansas.
The identity of composition and order of succession of the various beds represented in these sections, can scarcely be due to accident, but points rather to the conclusion that they were deposited at the same time in the same ocean.
For the sake of comparison we give below, in a tabular form, Mr. Marcou's section of Pyramid Mountain, with columns showing the parallelism of the various beds with the formations in Nebraska, Kansas, New Jersey and Alabama, as well as his views respecting the parallelism of the same with formations of the Old World.
* Since these remarks were written, I have received with deep regret the sad news of Mr. Pra'ten s death.
In making this announcement, it affords me a mel incholy pleasure to bear witness t p his merits as a man and a devoted cultivator of natural science.
Along with all the artless simplicity of a child, he possessed an intellect of no ordinary powers ; while his studious habits and untiring perseverance, aided by a wonderful memory, had enabled him, under circumstances far from propitious, to acquire an amount of knowledge in various departments of science, of which the most favored might be proud.
Perhaps no person now Uving possesses a better knowledge of the western carboniferous fossils than he did; and yet this was only one of several branches of science to which he had devoted many years of his life.
His quiet habits and unpretending manners, however, had to a great extent prevented his real merits fr.im being duly appreciated outside of a comparaiively limited circle of personal acquaintances.
With all, and better than all, his other qualities of head and heart, Mr. Pratten was a high minded, honorable man.

Mr. Marcou does not mention the occurrence of Inoceramus problematicus in the limestone (a) of his section at this locility, but it has been found in this position at various localities in the south-west by others, as stated in our last communication.
From the facts given by him, there is also scarcely room for a doubt, but the specimen of Ostrea congesta, we mentioned seeing in his colleetionf (Proceed.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
November last) from Galisteo, was either found in this bed or the clays immediately below it, {b of his section,) in both of which deposits it occurs in Nebraska.
As Pyramid Mountain is but an isolated portion, left by the denudation of the surrounding strata, of a great elevated plateau known as the Llano Estacado, which occupies a vast area of country in western Texas and New Mexico, it is highly probable the beds composing Mr. Marcou's section are widely distributed • We think these identical with species found by Dr. George B. Shumard at Fort Washita, Texas, where they appear to hold the same geological position, and are associated with Ammonites vesperlimis (Morton.)
Dr. B. F. Shumard has correctly, as we believe, referred the first to (iryphcBa Pitcheri (Morton), and described the laiter as « new specie*, under the name of Ostrea suhovate.
(See Capt.
Marcy's Report Explorations Red River, page 205 — Appendix.)
We are almost willing to hazard the opinion, that these species will yet be found in Southern Nebraska, or north-eastern Kansas, in formation No.
2 of the Nebraska Section.
t In alluding to this fact in our last paper, we inadvertently omitted to mention that the specimen seen by us is in the possession of Prof Hall, by whose permission we referred to its occurrence at that locaUty.
[May, over the far south-west.
This conclusion is also borne out by the statements of Capt.
Marcy and other explorers of that region.
The facts given by this gentleman and Dr. G. G. Shumard, likewise point to the conclusion that the great gypsum deposits of the south-west hold a position equivalent to No.
2, or the upper part of No.
1 of the Nebraska section.
From all the facts, we are led to believe, as stated on a former occasion, that the divisions No.
4 and 5 of Nebraska, and their equivalents in New Jersej' and Alabama, are entirely wanting, or but meagrely represented, throughout the south-west; and that No.
2 and No.
3 are the main fossil-bearing strata of that region ; while No.
1, which there as in the north-west and in Alabama, rei)0ses on Carboniferous strata, attains a much greater development than in either of those countries.
Conclusions.
Ist.
We have no evidence that any of the Tertiary deposits now known in Nebi-aska are older than Miocene.
2d.
The estuary and fresh-water deposits at the mouth of Judith River are probably on a parallel with the lowest bed of the Great Lignite basin, though some portions of them ~iay be so.mewhat older.
'dd.
The Great Lignite basin and the Mauvaiies Terres of White River, though probably both Miocene, are not exactly on a parallel.
Ath.
We have in Nebraska a more complete series of Cretaceous formations, and consequently a better standard of comparison for rocks of that age, than is yet known to exist in any other portion of this country.
bth.
The formations in New Jersey and Alabama generally referred to the Cretaceous system, are on a parallel with the iqjper and lower members of the Nebraska section, (No.
1, 4 and 5 ;) while nearly, if not quite all the main fossilbearing deposits older than Tertiary, and newer than Carboniferous, in Kansas, Arkansas, Texas and New Mexico, are on a parallel with the middle and lower portions of the same.
Qlh.
Although the beds No.
2 and 3 of the north-west, are extensively developed, and probably the principal fossiliferous Cretaceous deposits of the far south-west, we have up to this time, no evidence of their existence east of the Mississippi.
Consequently the marked typical differences observable between most of the Cretaceous fossils hitherto found in the south-west, and those characterizing the upper Cretaceous formations of Nebraska, Alabama and New Jersey, are not wholly due to the fact that they belonged to different zoological districts ; nor yet, as might be supposed in regard to the Nebraska and New Jersey species, to the modifying effects of physical conditions dependent on latitude ; but mainly to the fact that they belong to another geological horizon, and consequently lived during a different epoch.
7th.
There is at the base of the Cretaceous System, at distantly separated localities in Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico, Alabama and New Jersey, if not indeed everywhere in North America where that System is well developed (at any rate east of the Rocky Mountains), a series of various colored clays and sandstones, and beds of sand, often of great thickness, in which organic remains, excepting leaves of apparently dicotyledonous plants, fossil wood, and obscure casts of shells, are very rarely found, but which everywhere preserves a uniformity of lithological and other characters, pointing unmistakeably to a similarity of physical conditions daring their deposition, over immense areas.
8th.
Although the weight of evidence thus far favors the conclusion that this lower series is of the age of the lower Green Sand, or Neocomien, of the old world, we yet want positive evidence that portions of it may not be older than any part of the Cretaceous System.

10 DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW FOSSILS.
* Ptychoceras Mortoni.
Shell small and thin, elongate cylindrical ; larger half, or body, very slightly tapering, apparently rounded on the dorsum, and concave along the inner side for the reception of the slender smaller half.
Surface ornamented by rather strong annular costae, which are less prominent, and somewhat irregularly divided on the body, and bifurcate occasionally on the smaller part ; dorsum of the slender half ornamented by two rows of very small nodes, arranged upon the costae ; fine indistinct lines of growth mark the shell parallel to the ribs.
Aperture, septa, and siphuncle unknown.
Length (of specimen imperfect at the aperture, and apex of smaller portion) about 1 inch; breadth -26 inch ; diameter of slender part -12 inch ; do.
of body -17 inch.
This shell is about the size, and has much the general appearance of a species described by Dr. Morton from the deep cut of the Chesapeake and Delaware canal, under the name of Hamites annuUfer (Jour.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
vol.
8, pi.

4,; but differs from his figure in having bifurcating instead of simple costae.
It is possible, however, that they may not be distinct, though it is hardly probable so important a character as the bifurcation of the costae would have escaped the attention of so close an observer as Dr. Morton.
Judging from the nodes seen along the dorsum of the smaller portion of our shell, it appears probable similar or stronger nodes may have existed along the outside of the body, or larger half; if so, it must have differed materially in this respect from Dr. Morton's species.
When entire our specimen must have been not less than 1 J to 2 inches in length.
Dedicated to the lamented Dr. George Morton of Philadelphia.
Locality and position.
Great bend of the Missouri, formation No.
4. of the series.
Serpula?
tenuicarinatds.
Shell growing in groups, or rarely single, slightly compressed-cylindrical, increasing very gradually in size, irregularly curved or flexuous, not spirally coiled; attached by one side nearly the whole length; having a distinctly elevated, linear carina along the upper side ; surface sometimes very obscurely undulating transversely, otherwise smooth.
Length unknown; transverse diameter about .14 inch.
As we have no perfect specimens of this fossil, it is with some doubt we refer it to the genus Serpula.
It appears to have no internal septa as in Ver■meius ; and we have seen no indications of an operculum as in Vermicularia ; consequently we place it provisionally in the genus Serpula.
Locality and position.
— Mouth of Vermillion River, on the Missouri, formation No.
2 of the series.
VlTRINA OBLIQUA.
Shell obliquely oval ; spire much depressed ; volutions four to four and a half, first two or three increasing rather slowly in size, last one ventricose and rapidly enlarging, prominent below ; suture distinct ; aperture circular ; surface unknown.
Greatest transverse diameter .64 inch ; height .50 ; diameter of aperture .ST inch.
Having seen only internal casts of this shell, we are in some doubt about its generic relations ; as its associates, however, belong to land and freshwater genera, and its form agrees very nearly with that of Vitrina, we place it provisionally in that genus.
It resembles a species described by Reuss and Von Meyer, under the name of V. intermedia from the Tertiary Lacustrine deposits in the north of Bohemia, (see Tert.
Siiss.

but has more volutions.

[May, Helix occidkntalis.
Shell thin, rather small, depressed nearly orbicular; volutions four, convex above, proniiuent, or almost subangular a little above the middle of the outside, gibbous below, most convex near the umbilicus ; surface ornamented by regular rather strong oblique lines of growth; suture well defined; umbilicus deep, less than one third the transverse diameter of the shell, exhibiting most of the inner volutions ; aperture round oval, modified slightly by the succeeding whorl ; lip sharp, not reflexed.
Greatest transverse diameter .33 inch; height .21 inch ; greatest diameter of aperture .16 inch.
This neat little Helix is more nearly related to the recent H. strialella of Anthony than to any other shell we have seen figured, but is larger, has a smaller umbilicus, and appears to be more strongly striated.
iMr.
Anthony says the umbilicus of IT.
striateUa is not equal to the body whorl.
In the species before us, it is scarcely half equal to the body volution near the aperture.
Locality and position.
Same as last.
Helix vitrinoides.
Shell subglobose; spire elevated; volutions about four, convex, increasing rather rapidly, last one somewhat ventricose, contracted a little near the lip ; suture distinct; umbilicus very small or closed; aperture oval or ovate; (lip reflexed?)
; surface unknown.
Height .37 inch ; breadth .44 inch ; greater diameter of aperture .27 inch ; smaller do.
.20 inch.
Of this species wc have only seen internal casts, and consequently know nothing of its surface markings.
Judging from the slight contraction of the body whorl of the cast near the aperture, it is probable the lip was thickened and reflexed.
Locality atid position.
Same as last.
Planorbis tenuivolvis.
Shell planiorbicular ; spire flat or nearly so ; volutions six to six and a half, extremely narrow and closely embracing ; increasing very gradually, scarcely one-third as broad as high, rounded above, prominent, or almost subangular round the outer margin, from which they round obliquely downwards and inwards towards the umbilicus, near which they are more prominent or subangular; suture well defined; umbilicus deep, acutely conical ; equalling about one-third the greater diameter of the shell, and exhibiting the volutions quite to the apex of the spire ; surface and aperture unknown ; section of volutions extremely narrow and strongly arcuate.
Greater diameter .15 inch ; height .OG inch.
This remarkably delicate little shell resembles the following species (P. amplexus) more than any with which we are acquainted ; it differs, however, in having much narrower and more closely wound volutions ; about the same number being present in specimens measuring not much more than one-third the transverse diameter of that shell.
Locality aiid position.
Same as last.
Planorbis amplexus.
Shell planorbicular ; spire flat, or nearly so ; volutions six, closely embracing, narrow, very gradually increasing, nearly twice as high as wide, rounded on the outside, subangular round the umbilicus ; surface marked by lines of growth, which pass round very obliquely backwards from above to a point below the middle of the outer part of the whorls, where they are again directed slightly forwards, so as to indicate the presence of a broad, undefined sinus, below the middle of the outer lip ; aperture unknown, umbilicus conical, deep, less than half the greater diameter of the shell, exhibiting the inner whorls.
Greatest diameter .39 inch ; height .25 inch.
This species bears some resemblance to our P. convolutus (Proceedings Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
vol.
8, p. 1 20,) but has from one to one and a half more volutions, which 1857.]
ai-e much narrower and more embracing.
The spire also differs ia being flat instead of convex, as in P. convolutus, and the umbilicus is much deeper, narrower and more defined in the species before us.
Locality and position.
Bed C of the section of freshwater and estuarj deposits at mouth of Judith River.
Planorbis fragilis.
Shell rather large, very thin, nearly planiorbicular ; (spire much depressed or flattened ?)
; umbilicus large, deep and exhibiting all the whorls to the apex of the spire; volutions five or six, (much depressed or flat above?)
prominent below, rounded on the lower outer side, subangular round the margins of the umbilicus ; (periphery angular ?)
; surface marked by rather faint lines of growth.
Greatest diameter 1.23 inches ; height about .40 inch.
As we have seen oilly imperfect specimens of this shell, we thiijk the above description may have to be modified somewhat when better specimens are obtained.
In those we have seen, the volutions appear to have been nearly flat or much depressed above, in consequence of which the outer side of the whorls is distinctly angular.
This character, however, and the remarkable flatness of the spire, may be, at least to some extent, caused by pressure.
Locality and position.
— Fort Berthold on the Missouri River, ia Lignite Tertiary basin.
Melania scbtortuosa.
Shell conical screw-shaped ; spire not much elevated ; volutions about five, very convex, distinctly angular round the middle, increasing rather rapidly from the apex ; suture strongly defined, in consequence of the prominence of the angular whorls; surface and aperture unknown.
Length 29 "inch ; breadth •21 inch ; apical angle regular, divergence 47°.
The angular form of the whorls is so conspicuous a character in this species, that it will be at once known from all its associates, and indeed from all the Nebraska species we have seen, by this character alone.
It bears considerable reBemblance to M. tortuosa of Anthony, (An.
Lye.
Nat.
Hist., N. Y. vol.
6,) a recent species, but has a shorter spire, and not so many volutions.
It is, perhaps, nearer in form to M. acuio-carinata of Lea, but may be distinguished by its more distinctly angular body whorl ; the angle on Mr. Lea's species being only well denned on the spire.
Locality and position.
Mouth Judith River, bed C. of the section of freshwater and estuary deposits at that place.
Melania omitta.
Shell small, very slender ; spire elongate conical, acute at the apex ; volutions about seven, flattened, or very slightly convex, increasing very gradually from the apex; suture linear, not deeply impressed ; surface and aperture unknown.
Length -42 inch; breadth -12 ; apical angle regular, divergence 23°.
Although we have seen neither the aperture nor surface markings of this little shell, we have ventured to characterize it, believing its slender form alone will serve to distinguish it from any of the other species with which it is associated.
Locality a?id position.

Melania sdbl.'evus.
Shell elongate conical; spire elevated (acute at the apex?
); volutions (about seven?)
very depressed convex; suture rather distinctly defined ; surface apparently smooth, but when examined with a lens is seen to be marked by fine obscure lines of growth, crossed by extremely fine, nearly obsolete revolving striae; aperture ovate, angular above; columella and outer lip nearly equally [May, arcuate; pillar faintly sinuous below.
Length about 1-04 inch; breadth -38 inch ; apical angle slightly concave, divergence 24".
This species will be known from all the others we have seen in the Nebraska formations, by its slender spire, and slightly concave sides.
It is also proportionally longer than any Nebraska species known to us, excepting our M. convexa, (Proceedings of the Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
vol.
8, p. 125,) from which it may be at once distinguished by its depressed convex, instead of flat, volutions, more defined suture, finer revolving lines, and more slender spire.
Unfortunately none of our specimens are quite perfect enough to show the number of volutions ; one specimen consists of five turns of the spire, and, judging from the appearance of the broken apex, there were probably about two more.
Locality and position.
Bad lands of Judith River, bed G. of Fresh-water and Estuary formations at that place.
Melania invendsta.
Shell conical ovate; spire moderately elevated ; volutions about seven, very slightly convex, increasing rather slowly from the apex; suture linear, not much impressed ; surface marked by obscure lines of growth crossed by fine irregular rather indistinct revolving lines, a few of which, just below the suture, are larger than the others; aperture ovate; outer lip faintly sinuate above, rather prominent below the middle inner lip reflexed upon the imperforate columella, at the base of which it is broadly sinuou3.
Length -90 inch ; breadth -37 inch ; apical angle regular or a little convex, divergence 32°.
This shell is nearer our M. Ncbrasccnsis, (Proceedings of Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
vol.
8, p. 124,) than any of the Nebraska species known to us, but has about one more volution, and is uniformly more slender, the body volution being proportionally much smaller.
From M. sublcevus of this paper and any of the varieties of our 31. convexa with which it is associated, it may be known by its much less elongate form, and more obscure surface markings.
It appears to be about intermediate between our M. convexa and M. N'ebrascensis, but quite distinct from both.
Localitij and position.

Shell small, somewhat acutely conical ; spire rather elevated, pointed at the apex; volutions about seven and a half, depressed convex, closely wound and increasing gradually from the apex, last one sub-angular round the middle ; suture distinct; surface apparently smooth, or only marked by very faint lines of growth ; aperture broad ovate, obtusely angular above ; outer lip very faintly and broadly sinuate above; columella arcuate, rather faintly sinuate below.
Length -29 inch; breadth -14 inch ; apical angle convex, divergence 32®.
This neat little shell is nearer our M. AntJwni/i, (Proceed.

It has about one and a half to two more volutions than 3f.

Locality and position.
Summit of Square Butte, thirty miles below Fort Clark, on the Missouri, in a gray sandstone — an outlier of one of the lower strata of the Lignite Tertiary basin, where it is associated with Corbula mactriformig^ Melania Nebrascensis, and M, Conradi ?
Melania tenuicarinata.
Shell ovate conical; spire turreted, not very much elevated, pointed at the apex ; volutions six, convex, obliquely flattened above ; suture well-defined, in consequence of the prominence of the whirls; surface ornamented by fine regular lines of growth, crossed near the middle of the volutions by from two 1857.]
to about four distinctly elevated, revolving lines, which become ©bsolete near the apex of the spire ; the upper of these lines is larger than the others, and forms a well-marked keel, while the entire surface, above and below them, is marked br smaller, irregular, revolving lines, which, with the lines of growth, form a very fine indistinct cancellated style of ornament ; aperture oval ovate, obtusely angular above ; outer lip rather sharp, prominent a little below the middle, very faintly sinuous above; columella forming a gentle curve, scarcely sinuate below, not perforate.
Length '54 inch ; breadth -29 inch ; apical angle convex, divergence variable with age, averaging about 45''.
In some of its varieties this species approaches our M. Nebrascensis, (Proceedings Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila.,vol.
8, p. 124,) but has much more convex volutions, and greatly stronger revolving lines or keels, on the middle of the whorls.
At the time we described M. Nebrascensis, we had but few specimens, and those very imperfect; along with these there were one or two specimens of the species now before us, which we were then inclined to regard as only a variety of 31.
Nebrascensis.
The collection now in our possession shows, however, that they are distinct, consequently it will be necessary to modify somewhat our description of M. Nebrascensis, so as to include only those shells with flattened or depressed convex whorls, and revolving lines, a few of which are larger than others on the middle of the volutions, but never becoming distinct angles or carinas.

From the same locality and position as the above, we find amongst some of the late collections specimens presenting differences from that shell, which we suspect may be of specific importance ; we are unwilling, however, without more individuals for comparison, to run the risk of multiplying synonyms by attempting to characterize it as a distinct species.
It is a more slender shell than 31. convexa, the lower volutions are more rounded, and the suture much more distinctly impressed, especially between the lower whorls.
For the present we will designate this form as 3Ielania convexa, var.
impressa, and in case further comparisons prove it to be a distinct species, it may be designated by the latter name.
Fusns Vaughani.
Shell fusiform, rather thick ; volutions six to six and a half, convex, obliquely a little flattened or concave above, last one narrowing somewhat abruptly below into the (short?)
canal ; ornamented by small regular vertical folds, which are crossed by prominent revolving bands, less than the spaces between, so as to give the surface a coarsely cancellated aspect; of these bands about four on the body volution, and two on those of the spire are larger than the others, and form indistinct nodes, where they cross the vertical folds.
Below these four larger bands on the body whorl, there are about five or six other smaller and more oblique bands, which diminish in size from above; while on the upper obliquely flattened, or concave part of the same whorls, as well as on those of the spire, there are about four much smaller revolving bands or lines.
Entire .surface marked by distinct lines of growth, which are crossed by fine rather obscure revolving striaj, so as to produce, independent of the larger ornaments above mentioned, a fine reticulated style of marking.
Aperture narrow ovate or oval ; outer lip bevelled ; inner lip thin, folded upon the arcuate and tortuous columella.
Length about 1-43 inclies ; breadth -75 inch ; apical angle convex, divergence about 54°.
This species is quite unlike any of those we have hitherto seen from the Nebraska formations.
Although apparently occurring in the same bed with avcII m arked Cretaceous forms, it is, like many of the upper Cretaceous species already described by us from this region, very nearly allied to forms belonging to the [May Tertiary system of the old world.

It also has about one more volution, and the apical angle measures 5° less.

Scakboroughi.
Sliell fusiform ; spire conical, acute at the apex ; volutions about six and a half, flattened, or slightly concave above ; .last one contracting abruptly below into a small (rather short?)
canal ; suture small, not deeply impressed ; surface ornamented by fine regular lines of growth, crossed by numerous distinct, rather closely arranged, elevated, thread-like lines, which are slightly variable in size, but generally equalling the spaces between ; sometimes more closely crowded and smaller just below the suture, than on the middle of the whorls ; aperture narrow ovate, angular above, tapering into the canal below ; outer lip thin, 1857.]
prominent near the middle, and having a broad faint sinus above ; colnmella slightly arcuate.
Length about 1'42 inches; breadth -67 inch; apical angle very convex, divergence 40".
Not having seen a specimen of this species showing very clearly the form of the outer lip, we are left in some doubt as to whether it is not more nearly related to Pleurotoma than Fusus.
The lines of growth, are so deflected below the suture, as to indicate the presence of a broad faint sinus in the upper edge of the lip, as in Pleurotoma ; the general aspect of the shell, however, is more like Fusus than Pleurotoma.
It is probably one of those connecting links between those genera, often met with amongst fossil species.
None of our specimens show the entire length of the canal, but we are inclined to think it was not very long.
There is no other shell in the Nebraska formation No.
5 known to us, resembling this in other respects, that has so remarkably convex a spiral angle, the convergence from the first to the second volution being only about 30**, while the angle at the apex is as much as 48°.

New Gen. PSEUDOBUCCINUM.
Owing to the fact that the limits of the great genus Buccinum are badly defined, and several attempts have already been made to erect into distinct genera, forms regarded by many of the ablest conchologists as merely sections of that genus, it is with hesitation we venture to propose for a shell of this type a new generic name.
Although evidently related to Buccinum, the species before us presents, we think, an ensemble of characters of sufficient importance to be regarded as the type of a distinct group.
In the first place, it differs remarkably from the species of that genus known to us, in the deeply arcuate and strongly tortuous character of its columella, as well as in the comparatively large size of the body volution and aperture.
So distinctly marked are these characters, that it appears probable, if the matrix were removed from the inside of the shell, the whole interior, quite to the apex of the spire, would be visible from below.
It likewise differs from any of the species of Buccinum coming under our observation, in being a much thinner shell, and in having, instead of a short reflexed canal or deep notch at the base of the columella, simply a small rounded sinus.
In form and general appearance it resembles Sulcobuccinum of D'Orbigny, and Pseudoliva, of Swainson ; but differs from them both in its strongly arcuate and tortuous columella, as well as in wanting the revolving sulcus on the exterior of the body whorl.
It is also a much thinner shell than we have seen amongst the species of either of these types, and wants the small notch in the outer lip, characteristic of the first, and the projecting spine on the inner side of the same in the other.
As it is not possible to give definitely the characters of a genus, of which but a single species is known, we will for the present merely repeat a description given on a former occasion of this shell, without attempting to separate the specific characters from those that may be only of specific importance.

Xylophaqa elegantula.
Shell small, globose-cordate, very ventricose ; posterior rounded and closed ; anterior having a profound angular notch in the under part, so as to produce a very large hiatus extending more than one-third the length of the shell back from the buccal extremity, and above the middle; beaks elevated, gibbous, very strongly incurved and placed a little in advance of the middle ; surface ornamented by small regular concentric wrinkles and very fine lines of growth ; the wrinkles are rather obscure on the posterior part of the shell, but upon reaching a narrow sulcus, which passes from the beaks to the base, a little in advance of the middle of the shell, they suddenly become more distinct, and are deflected upwards nearly parallel with the vertical margins of the hiatus, near which they again become very fine and regular; on passing upon that portion of the valves extending out in front over the hiatus, these fine wrinkles are deflected, almost in a horizontal direction, and suddenly enlarged, but rapidly diminish, and converge as they pass round the anterior extremity.
On the cast, the mesial sulcus extending from the beaks to the base is very narrow but deep and sharply defined.
At the points where the concentric wrinkles cross this sulcus or groove, it is distinctly punctate.
Further back, a rather distinct carina extends from the back part of the beaks obliquely backwards and downwards nearly to the base of the shell ; immediately behind this ridge, the posterior part of the cast is suddenly compressed, and faintly marked by a large leaf-like muscular impression.
The pallial impression is narrow, stands nearly vertical, and extends more than halfway up to the beaks between the mesial sulcus and posterior carina.

Xylophaga Stimpsoni.
Shell ovate, gibbous in front, and cuneate behind ; posterior end obliquely subtruncate above, round below, nearly or quite closed; anterior having a distinct angular notch below, which forms a large hiatus extending back onefourth the length of the skull and upwards above the middle ; base and dorsal margins parallel ; beaks not much elevated above the dorsal edge, pointed at the apex, and strongly incurved.
Surface marked by distinct, regular concentric wrinkles, and extremely fine lines of growth.
The wrinkles are more obscure on the posterior part of the shell, but on crossing a narrow sulcus (in the cast) that passes from the beaks to the base, they become more distinct, and curve gracefully upwards nearly parallel with the edge of the hiatus; on passing forward upon the upper anterior part of the valves extending out over the hiatus, they are suddenly deflected in a horizontal direction and become stronger, but rapidly diminish and converge in passing round the anterior extremity.
On the cast, the mesial groove extending from the apex of the beaks obliquely downwards and a little backwards to the base, is narrow but well defined.
A little in advance of this, and nearly parallel with it, a fainter impressed line passes from the beaks to the base.
About halfway between the mesial groove and the posterior end of the shell, another deep, but broader, groove extends from the posterior side of the beaks obliquely backwards nearly to the lower part of the anal extremity; behind this the narrow oval posterior muscular impression is seen faintly indicated near the border.
Although resembling the last in its style of ornament, this is a very distinct 1857.]

Although we know nothing of rLe surface markings or interior of this shell, we have ventured to characterize it, believing it important to call attention to the few forms found in the formation in which it occurs, however obscure they may be, as there remains some doubt in regard to the exact age of this deposit.

New Gen. CORBULAMELLA.
The small shell upon which we propose to establish the above genus appears to be related both to Cardilia of Deshays, and Corbula of Bruguiere.
It differs from the first, however, in being distinctly inequivalve, and in wanting the spoon-shaped projection for the reception of the ligament, mentioned by Deshays.
From Corbula it differs in having the posterior muscular attacliment raised upon a thin, strongly projecting plate, as in Cuculloea.
The teeth of the hinge, and pallial impression appear to be as in Corbula.
We have not been able to determine whether the ligament was internal or external.
* Mr. Meek.
[May, As this shell appears to agree in so many characters with Corlula, the propriety of separating it from that genus may be doubted by some; it presents, however, such a marked difference from any species of Corbula we have seen, in the peculiar very strongly projecting internal plate above referred to, that we are satisfied there nmst have been some corresponding difference in the organization of the animal.
As we have hitherto met with but the one species, it is of course impossible to determine, in every instance, which of its characters are of specific, and which of generic importance, consequently we will not attempt to give a formal diagnosis of the genus, but will merely repeat, with slight modifications, the description given by us some little time back in the Proceedings of the Academy.

Cyprina arenarea.
Cast of interior very broad ovate, subtrigonal, moderately compressed, most convex in the umbonial region ; extremities rounded, the posterior sometimes slightly truncate ; base semi-ovate or broadly rounded ; dorsal margin sloping rather abruptly, with a regular convex curve from the beaks to the posterior end, concave and much more abruptly' declining in front ; beaks rather elevated, slightly gibbous, located a little in advance of the middle of the shell.
Length .95 inch ; height .80 inch ; breadth .53 inch.
This species has much the form and general appearance of a Cytherea, but as there is no indication of a sinus in the pallial impression, on any of the casts we have seen, and the teeth of the hinge, as near as can be ascertained from internal cast, are like those of Cyprina^ we place it provisionally in that genus.

Length 1.66 inches ; height 1.68 inches ; breadth about 1.49 inches.
As we have not yet seen the hinge of this shell, we are in some doubt in regard to its affinities ; and only place it provisionally in the genus Cyprina.
The character of the muscular impressions, with its simple pallial line, and general appearances, are such as to indicate its relations to that genus.
It will be at once distinguished from all the other forms we have yet seen from the Nebraska rocks, by its high curved beaks, gibbous cordate form, and distinct lines of growth ; the radiating lines mentioned above are so ver}' faint as to be readily overlooked, excepting when the shell is viewed in a certain light, and may be often absent.

Cyprina compressa.
Shell broad ovate, rather thin and compressed, somewhat narrowly rounded at the extremities, base semi-oval ; beaks elevated, approximate, not strongly curved, located about three-eighths the length of the shell back of the anterior end ; cardinal border declining rather abruptly, with a greatly convex outline, from the beaks towards the posterior end, concave and mere abruptbefore the beaks ; surface unknown ; muscular impressions rather distinct.
Length 2.66 inches; height 2.1Y inches; breadth about 1.15.
We are not sure we have seen specimens of this species showing the surface characters; some fragments in the collection from the same locality and position apparently of the same shell, are simply marked with rather strong lines of growth.
It is barely possible this may be a variety of the last ; the beaks, however, are so much more elevated, and farther removed from the anterior end, that we are at present inclined to regard it as a distinct species.

Same as last.
Cyprina subtumida.
Shell rather small, ovate, moderately gibbous ; anterior end narrowly rounded below the beaks ; posterior subtruncate at the extremity ; base forming a gently convex curve, contracted towards the posterior ; cardinal border declining with a long gentle curve from the beaks to the posterior end, concave and very abrupt in front ; beaks located near the anterior end, directed obliquely forward, not much elevated ; umbonial region gibbous ; valves prominent or almost subangular from near the beaks obliquely backwards towards the lower part of the posterior end ; muscular impressions not deep, anterior ones smaller and more distinct than the others; surface unknown.
Length (of cast) -92 inch ; height -65 inch ; breadth -55 inch.
This species is not very nearly related to any we have seen figured in foreign works, and may be known from any of those we have described from the North West, excepting C. cordata, by its more gibbous form, more ventricose and oblique umbonial slopes, as well as less elevated beaks.
From C. cordata it will be at once distinguished by its ovate form and greatly less elevated beaks.
Our specimens do not show very satisfactorily the surface markings, as the exterior has been mainly removed by the exfoliation of the shell.
There are, however, indications of lines of growth, and on the surfaces of the laminae faint traces of radiating mai'ks ; though the latter may have had no connection with surface markings.
Not enough of the shell remains to show the character of the points of the beaks.

Length 3-50 inches ; height 1'54 inches; breadth about 1 inch.
After satisfying ourselves that this and the two following species are distinct from all the fossil Uniones described in any works within our reach, we submitted them to Mr. Isaac Lea, tlie well-known conchologist of Philadelphia, from whom we received the following remarks respecting their affinities to recent species. "
The specimen marked Unio Danai has very much the same outline with Margarilina margaritifera^ Schm., but is a true Unio, and perhaps more nearly allied to U. lumidus, Retzius, than to any other of the genus.
It is certainly an undescribed species. "
Unio Deiceyanus is a very distinct species, and although not more than half the size, very closely resembles the recent U.
^rwwca^Ms, Swainson, in outline and obliqueness.
It is also, like it, a thick ponderous species. "
Unio subspalulaius is an oblique species, nearly allied to U. spatulalus, Lea.
but is more rounded posteriorly than that shell. "
All these species are characterized by an obliqueness not usual in the genus.
The beaks are nearly terminal in all of them, and they have a general massive character, which causes a disposition to enlarged cardinal and lateral teeth.
This enlargement is more particularly noticeable in the cardinal teeth, which are all massive and very much corrugated.
It is evident from the deep corrugations of the great cicatrices, that the muscular power of the animal was very great. "
They are certainly very interesting specimens, and deserve attention, as they differ much from the general type of recent Uniones, as well as those of tlie Wealden of England."
Owing to the fact that these shells were obtained from a formation in which saurian remains, similar to some of those of the Wealden were found, we called Mr. Lea's attention to that fact, with the view of also obtaining his opinion respecting their affinities to Wealden forms.
From his remarks above, it will be seen he is of the opinion they are distinct from the types of that epoch.
Mr. Lea's opinion on this point is of much value, since he had an opportunity, while in England some years since, of studying very carefully Dr. ManteU's extensive collection of Wealden species.
We name this shell in honor of Prof. James D. Dana, the distinguished naturalist of New Haven, Connecticut.

Shell transversely oval, nearly circular, not much compressed, equilateral ; extremities rounded, posterior end sometimes slightly broader than the other : base rather more broadly rounded ; cardinal border slightly arched, moderately thick ; beaks (obtuse?)
not much elevated or incurved ; surface ornamented by about fifty simple, rounded, depressed radiating plications, a little more than twice a« broad as the grooves between, crossed by numerous regular, distinct, imbricating lines of growth, which arch upwards in crossing the costse ; cardinal teeth about twenty-five, not large, lateral ones arcuate, with the concave sides turned from the beaks ; ligament area moderate, marked by about six grooves, which form very obtuse angles under the beaks ; muscular impressions large but not deep.
Length 1-49 inches ; height 1-36 inches ; breadth 1-02 inches.
Associated with the above we have a single valve of another individual not more than one-sixth as large, and having comparatively a smaller ligament area, fewer teeth and rather less prominent beaks.
The costse are also apparently obsolete over proportionably larger spaces at the extremities of the hinge.
This we suspect may be a distinct species, but without more specimens for comparison we are unwilling to so regard it at present.

This species resembles 0. larva of Lamarck, and is the shell referred by ns with doubt to that species in the catalogue of Nebraska Cretaceous and Tertiary fossils given in our last paper.
A comparison of better specimens in the late collections, with authentic specimens of 0. larva proves them to be quite distinct.
Our shell never being near so distinctly plicated round the border as that species, nor is it auriculate on both sides of the beak as in 0. larva.
Its mode of attachment is likewise altogether different, being more like 0. crenulata of Tuomey, in that respect; it also sometimes resembles the latter shell in the crenulate character of its borders on each side of the beaks, but differs in wanting the closely plaited squaniose ridges mentioned by Prof. Tuomey.

The posterior position of the apical disc, and the close proximity of mouth to the front, as well as the great inequality of the posterior and anterior lateral ambulacra, appear to remove it from the genus Toxaster.
In some respects it resembles the genus Schizaster, but does not decline so distinctly towards the front above, as is common amongst the species of that genus.
It may belong to a new type.
It is remarkable, that in all the collections hitherto obtaiued from the Cretaceous rocks of Nebraska, this is the only species of Echinodi-nn yet met with, and it is so rare that but the single specimen now before us, and a fragment mentioned in one of our former papers, from the same locality, have been met with.
We take pleasure in naming this rare and beautiful fossil in honor of Capt.

On the LABVA of the Thyreus Abbottii.
BY J. P. KIRTLAND, M. D. Swainson, in his Zoological Illustrations, vol.
i.
First Series, described the Thyreus Abbottii, which, together with the Pupa and Larva, he figured on the authority of Mr. Abbott's unpublished drawings.
Dr. Harris' Catalogue of North American Sphinges, in the Amer.
Jour, of .Sciences and Arts, vol.
xxxvi., contains also a description of this larva, drawn from Swainson's sketch.
With due deference to these high authorities, I beg leave to state, that neither their figures nor descriptions bears the least resemblance to the true larva.
During the last three years I have reared many of them and carried them through the second stages of transformation to the perfect insect.
At maturity the Larva is about the length of Swainson's figure, but its diameter is one-fifth less.
Its upper surface is ash color, with its belly and legs tinged with a faint violet.
It is not furnished with a caudal horn as represented in Swainson's figure, but in place of it has an oval eyelet or occuli, of a glossy brown color, and a line or two in diameter.
This Larva resembles more the common silk worm (Bombyx mori) than it does Swainson's figure.
Its principal food is the leaf of the Ampelopsis quinquefolia, though it occasionally is found on the cultivated grape vine.
During the month of August it attains its full size, and individuals may be seen at night descending to the ground, where it enters the pupae state, below the reach of frost.
Specimens kept in boxes of earth beneath the shelves of a warm green house, appeared in the perfect state as early as the first of April, while those preserved in a cool cellar did not assume that form till late in May, or early in June.
That Dr. Harris was led into an error by Swainson's figure I have no doubt, for Dr. H. sent me a drawing and colored figure of this true Larva four years since, requesting of me information as to the perfect insect it produced.
To prevent a further extension of that error is the object of this communication.

Description of two new genera of Shells, and Rectification of some of the generic names of American Tertiary Fossils, by T. A. Conrad.
Which as usual were referred to committees.
Dr. Leidy remarked t'.iat upon one of the specimens of coal shales with fossil fishes, from Linton, Jefferson Co., Ohio, presented this evening by Mr. Wheatley, there was a compressed oval, black, shining, brittle, homogeneous mass, about three inches long, and one inch and a quarter wide, by two lines in thickness, which he suspected to be the ink bag of a Loligo, or cuttle-fish.
The carbonaceous mass can readily be reduced to an impalpable powder, which has the same appearance and color as that derived from the fossil Loligo of the Lias of Wiirtemburg.
Mr. Lea exhibited two specimens from the dark slates of the Red Sandstone of Phoenixville, Pa., which had been procured by Mr. Wheatley from the tunnel of the Reading Railroad.
These specimens contained a hone and a coproUte, and through the mass could be observed imperfect portions of the so-called Posidonia, which has been found usually wherever these black slates occur.
The bone is fractured at both ends, is nearly four inches long and three-quarters by nearly half an inch thick.
It is flattened on the outside and curved on the inner side.
The transverse section nearly resembles that which, as the fore-arm or leg, Mr. Lea figured in the Journal, N. S., vol.
ii., pi.
18, fig.
1, under the name of Clepsj/saurus Pennsylvanicns, and it may be identical with that species ; or it may belong to that of Centemodon sulcatus, Lea, which was described in the Proceedings of the Academy in April of last year, from a single tooth, and which he found within a few hundred yards of the same locality, at the northern end of the same tunnel.
This is another evidence among the very few in Pennsylvania of the existence of Saurian life at the period of this interesting Red Sandstone formation.
The specimen of coprolite is more perfect than any Mr. Lea had seen from the same locality, and was probably one of the ejectamenta of this Saurian.

_ Dr. B. CoATES in the Chair.
Dr. Leidy remarked that the specimens of coprolites and shales with Fostdonice, and the left dental bone of a fish presented by Mr. Conrad and himself this evening, had been obtained in a recent visit to Black Tunnel, near Phoenix1857.]
11 ville, Chester Co.
The Posidonice Mr. Conrad regards as identical with the P. multicostata and P. triangularis of Prof. Emmons, obtained from a corresponding geological formation of Chatham Co., N. C* The former species had been previously indicated by Mr. Lea under the name of P. ovata-f from specimens obtained at Phoenixville, and probably the latter was also indicated under the name oi P.parva from smaller specimens than those presented this evening, but likewise obtained from the same locality.
The dental bone referred to, apparently belongs to a ganoid fish, probably allied to Eugnathus or Belonosiomus.
Dr. L. further observed that Prof. Emmons had recently discovered the remains of an insectivorous mammal in the same series of rocks of Chatham Co., X. C.{ The animal, Dromatherium sylvestre, is closely allied to the Spalacotherium, Owen, from the English Purbeck beds of the oolitic series, and it may probably indicate that the rocks in which it was found, with those corresponding in this State, may be of the same age as those of the Richmond coal field.
The Clepsysaurvs, Lea, of the same rocks of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, is not properly a thecodent reptile, but may form the type of a new family, as its teeth are inserted in the jaw by solid conical fangs.
Omosaurus of the same formations is probably a distinct genus from Clepsysaurus.

Dr. Leidy read a letter fom Dr. J. S. Newberry, dated Washington, D. C., May 4, 1857, desiring that the title Mekolepis, applied by him to a genus of fossil fish, be changed to Eurylepis, the former having been anticipated by Dumeril and Bibron.
The species would then read Eurylepis corrugatus ; E. tuherculatus ; E. gramdahis ; E. lineatus ; E. ovoideus J E. 07'natissimus ; E. insculptus ; E. scrratus.
Dr. Leidy exhibited specimens of New Red Sandstone fossils from near the Gwyned tunnel, on the North Pennsylvania Railroad, collected by Mr. Lea and himself.
These are species of Cypris, very numerous, some scales of Ganoid fishes, and remains of bones and teeth, probably Batrachian.
Dr. Morris called the attention of the Academy to some fishes kept in a vase where water was not removed frequently enough ; the fishes then rise at short intervals to the surface and swallow air, thus maintaining their respiration ; showing that the exchange of gases in this class of animals takes place readily as long as the branchiae are kept moist, and illustrating the mode of respiration in the genus Anabas.

Mr. Yaux read a letter from Mr. John Biddle, dated June 11th, 1857, accompanying the crania of Thugs presented this evening.
My late brother-in-law Wm.
A.
Foster, in 1836 (at which time we were both residing in Calcutta) applied to Dr. Martin, E. I. Co.'s Surgeon, and the leading physician of that city, to procure for him the skulls of some Thugs.
Dr. M. did not succeed in obtaining them until the latter part of 1837, at which time Mr. F. had left India for the United States.
As I was still there.
Dr. M. sent them to me for Jlr.
F., and I shipped the lot, consisting of six, to Philadelphia.
On their arrival, Mr. F. was absent from the United States, and had transferred them to me.
Dr. Martin, in his note accompanying them, stated that they were the heads of notorious Thugs, who had recently been hung by direction of the Court for the suppression of Thuggee established by the E. I. Co. ; and I entertain no doubt of the correctness of his statement.
As to the province of Hindoostan, to which the birth place of these six Thugs should be referred, Dr. M. said nothing, and probably knew nothing.
Neither did he inform me in which district they were tried and executed; but at the period at which he procured them, Thuggee was practised much more extensively in the region about the head waters of the Ganges than in the province of Bengal; and I presume that they were obtained from the former region.
Two of the six skulls were sent by me to our late friend Dr. Samuel G. Morton, in W. A.
Foster's name.
I suppose them to be the same which appear in the Catalogue of Crania belonging to the Academy.
Two others I presented to George Combe, of Scotland, when on a visit to our city, many years ago; and the remaining two you now have.

Notes on the Geology of the Mauvaises Terres of White River, Nebraska.
BY F. V. HAYDEN, M. D. This interesting lacustrine deposit has but recently been made known to the scientific world, — wonderful not alone for its unique scenery, but also for the abundance and importance of its organic remains ; and although it has been as yet but partially explored, the results that have been obtained have proved of the highest interest.
The profusion of Mammalian and Chelonian remains which have been entombed in its strata, of species and, in most cases, genera, though closely allied, yet differing from all known living forms, its purely fresh1857.]
water origin and remarkable physical features, must render it, when fully explored and studied, classic ground to the Geologist and Palaeontologist.
I now propose to give a brief account of the histoiy and progress of its discovery, note the different expeditions which have visited it, and present, in as short a compass as possible, what is now known respecting its geology.
The history of its esploi-ation up to 1853 I quote from Prof. Leidy's great work, "The Ancient Fauna of Nebraska."
" This extensive cemetery of eocene vertebrata in the Mauvaises Terres, or Bad Lands, was first brought to our notice in a communication entitled, ^Dtscription of a fossil Maxillary Bone of a Palceotherium from near White River ^ published by Hiram A.
Front, M. D., of St. Louis, in the American Journal of Science and Arts for 1847, page 248.'
"Nearly at the same time Mr. S. D. Phillips, when on a visit to Chambersburgh, observed in the possession of Dr. S. JD.
Culbertson, several remarkable mammalian fossils, which had been sent as curiosities from the Bad Lands by his nephew, Mr. Alexander Culbertson, of the American Fur Company.
These specimens, at the suggestion of the late distinguished Dr. S. G. Morton, were obtained through Dr. John H. B. McClelland, a friend of Dr. Culbertson, and were obligingly placed in my hands for examination.
A description of them was published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for 1847 and 1848, and they were afterward presented by Alexander Culbertson to the Academy. "
The attention of Dr. D. D. Owen having been directed to the interesting reo-ion whence the fossils were obtained, he requested Dr. John Evans, an assistant in the Geological Survey in which he was engaged, to pay it a visit.
This gentleman brought home a magnificent collection of fossils, which form the basis of one of the chapters in Dr. Owen's Report.
* " Through the instrumentality of Prof. S. F. Baird, who from the first fully appreciated the importance of a complete examination of the Mauvaises Terres.
and their animal remains, Mr. Thaddeus A. Culbertson, under the auspiees of the Smithsonian Institution, visited the locality and brought home a valuable additional collection of Mammalian and Chelonian fossils.
"f In the spring of 1853, Dr. John Evans, U. S. Geologist, made an incidental tour to the Bad Lands, while on his way to his field of labors in Oregon, and obtained a very large and valuable collection; and besides re-collecting most of the forms already discovered, added five new species to the Fauna.
At the same time another expedition was fitted out and sent to the Bad Lands through the liberality of Prof. James Hall, the eminent Geologist and Palaeontologist of New York; and Mr. F. B. Meek and the writer were employed by him to perform the trip.
A large and valuable collection and much information were obtained, adding greatly to our knowledge of the country.
Three new species of mammals were also added to the Nebraska Fauna.
In February, 1855, while spending the winter at Fort Pierre, the writer made a tour to the Bad Lands, under the patronage of Col. A. J. Vaughan, U. S. Agent for the Upper Missouri Indians.
A severe storm of snow, however, rendered it impossible for him to go beyond Sage Creek.
A few mammalian remains and a fine collection of the fresh-water fossils fi'om Pinao's Spring were the only results.
In May of the same year the writer made a second trip by a route never before taken by travellers.
Leaving Fort Pierre, he took u south-easterly course, struck White River about thirty miles above its mouth, crossed the stream and ascended to the dividing ridge which overlooks the valley of Running Water, on the south side of White River and the main body of the Bad Lands.
An opportunity was thus given to examine the outliers and upper beds of the Bad Lands, ivhich resulted in the discovery of several new * See Dr. Leidy's Memoir, p. 533, of the Report of a Geological Survey of Wisconsiu.

A line opportunity was thus given to trace the connection of distant outliers on both sides of the Missouri, with the main body of the Bad Lands at the head of White and Shyenne rivers.
I will now present a vertical section showing the order of superposition of the diflerent beds at the various localities examined, premising, however, that the thickness of the strata are all estimated.
The section, therefore, cannot be as perfect as could be desired, but may throw some light on the geology of that interesting region.

1857.]
In making some general remarks in regard to the geology of the Bad Lands, I propose to take Fort Pierre as the starting point, pass up the valley of the Teton River to its source, and over the Plateau, skirting the northern side of the Bad Lands, enter the basin at Bear Creek, cross White River near Ash Grove Spring, and descend the valley of White River on the south side of the Bad Lands, below its confluence with the Missouri to Bijou Hills.
Leaving Fort Pierre, on our route to the Bad Lands, we take a course a little south of west along the valley drained by the Teton River and its tributaries.
This region is underlaid by Formation* No.
4 of the Cretaceous system.
The surface is quite undulating, presenting the usual indications of sterility, with verylittlf to break themonotony of the scenery until reaching Grindstone Hills, about eighty miles from our starting point, where a new feature presents itself.
These hills strike the eye of the traveller on account of their peculiar form, heighth and the immense ledges of rock that cap their summits.
These rocks present an exceedingly variable structure.
Some are formed of an aggregation of quartz fragments cemented with carbonate of lime ; others form a coarsegrained sandstone, or a conglomerate of water-worn pebbles mixed with angular grains of quartz.
This bed is undoubtedly an outlier of the Tertiary formations of the Bad Lands.
Underneath is the yellow arenaceous bed No.
5 of the Cretaceous system, and underlying this is No.
4, with its peculiar concretions and a few fossils.
Scattered through the valley of the little stream that flows at the base of the hills are slabs of Tertiary limestone containing fresh-water shells of the genera Limnea, Pla7iorbis, &c. On ascending the hills, the lofty spires of the Bad Lands first rise to view like a magnificent city imprinted on the sky.
At the head of Teton River the Cretaceous bed No.
5 becomes qiiite conspicuous, attaining a thickness of about eighty feet.
Very few fossils are found in it at this locality.
I succeeded in finding a single shell and the tooth of a fish, and Mr. Meek discovered in 1853 tracks of Planarian worms.
Here the country changes fi'om dreary sterility, with poor water and grass, to a cheerful aspect, fine springs, and a comparatively luxuriant vegetation.
Ascending the high hills at this point, we pass over the broad Plateau along side of the Bad Lands, their lofty pyramids rising high above the surrounding prairie.
Eight miles farther we come to Pinao's Spring, a noted camping place for travellers.
Near this place a ridge extends from the Bad Lands across the prairie toward the head of opening creek, about thirty feet in height, its sides gently sloping and covered with grass.
Scattered over this ridge are numerous thin slabs of whitish limestone with fresh water shells, which have been changed into a semitransparent chalcedony.
There are also concretionary masses of argillaceous limestone fully charged with these fossils in a fine state of preservation.
These fossils were first discovered by Drs.
Evans and Shumard in 1853, and have been indicated by them in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy.
They consist of Planorbis, Limnea, Physa and a small crustacean.
Several undescribed species have since been obtained from this locality, also a few teeth and jaws of Mammals, comminuted remains of fishes, and the seeds of a small species of Chara.
The discovery of these fossils afforded us positive evidence of the lacustrine character of this deposit.
This ridge forms bed D of the vertical section, and is composed mainly of yellow and light yellow calcareous marl.
Approaching Sage creek the country becomes exceedingly broken.
The Cretaceous bed No.
5 forms numerous pyramidal hills, some of them with almost vertical sides, their summits paved with well waterworn pebbles from the Drift.
In the channel of Sage creek the Cretaceous bed No.
4 makes its appearance, and forms a remarkable locality for its peculiar fossils.
Continuing our westerly course, we come to Bear creek, the usual camping place of visitors to the * See Vertical Section, in a paper by F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, in Proceedings of the Acauemy for May, 1857.
[June, Bad Lands.
Passing over the deep valley formed by this stream, we again ascend to a broad plateau which slopes gently away northward to the valley ot the Shyenne.
In the west the lofty range of the Black Hills is seen about sixty miles distant, like a black cloud looming up above the horizon.
Turning to the left we descend about fifty feet into the basin of the Bad Lands, a large area worn out as it were by the long continued action of atmosi)heric agencies, the material having been carried away by Bear creek and another tributary of theShyenne.
After making our descent we pass over a portion of this denuded area two or three miles in width, which is studded with low conical hills, on the sides and at the base of which are numerous dull reddish silico-argillaceous concretions, having much the shape and appearance of huge turtles.
From these concretions Messrs. Hall and Meek have described a remarkable Baculite, (B. grandis,) a true Cretaceous fossil, the position of which is in the upper portioii of a bed upon which the lowest stratum of the Tertiary basin of the Bad Lands rests.
Pursuing from thence a south-westerly course, we commence a gradual ascent and pass the junction of the two great Geological systems, the Cretaceous and Tertiary, into the Titanotherium bed, the lowest member of this Tertiary basin.
We have, first, an ash-colored silico-argillaceous stratum with a greenish tinge, interspersed with large aggregated masses of particles of quartz, passing up into a light gray calcareous grit.
In my vertical section I have concluded to throw all these strata, though presenting some lithological differences, into one bed, from the fact that the remains of the huge Pachyderm that has given it its name, are distributed to a greater or less extent all through it.
T( the Titanotherium may now be added another pachyderm discovered by the writer in 1855, and described by Dr. Leidy under the name of Hyopotamiits americanus.
Passing over a nearly level denuded area about five miles in width, underlaid by this bed, he came to the Turtle and Oreodon bed, so called from the immense numbers of the remains of these animals found in it.
This forms the lower member of bed B of the vertical section, and is by far the most fossiliferous portion of the Bad Lands.
Besides the remains of Oreodon and Testudo, which are most abundant, many other species of vertebrates have been described by Dr. Leidy from this bed.
They are found in the debris on the denuded plateau, or at the base of the Bluifs, and from the nearly perpendicular wall?
the Turtles often project like large colored concretions.
Some of the Turtles are of large size, measuring four feet in length and three to three and a half feet in width.
The most abundant species of Mammal appears to have been the Oreodon Gidbertsonii, of which fragments of more than five hundred individuals have already been obtained from an area not over five miles square, surrounding Ash Grove Spring, which is near the central portion of the Bad Lands.
The scenery is of the most remarkable and picturesque character.
No vegetation meets the eye, but on every side are high bare whitened walls, and the traveller winds his way through these labyrinthine passages as if in the gloomy apartments of some oriental sepulchre.
Continuing our ascent, we come to the dividing ridge between the Shyenne and White rivers, ranging north-east and south-west through the central portion of the Bad Lands, in which the little tributaries of these two rivers take their rise.
Here the Turtle and Titanotherium beds are concealed, and the upper members of this deposit are well exhibited.
Descending the slope toward White River the Turtle bed again appears, and in the channel of White River a stratum of fine gray grit is seen, the upper portion of the bed containing bones of Titanotherium Prouti.
Crossing White River we pass down the south side of the main body of the Bad Lands, and find that on this side the beds consist mostly of outliers holding a higher geological position than those at Bear Creek or Ash Grove Spring.
Near the entrance of Mule Creek and of several of the tributaries of White River, are some beautiful exhibitions of the architectural features of the Bad 1857.]
Lands.
They remind one of some ancient city with its palaces, domes and towers.
At the mouth of Mule Creek we have one of the most picturesque views in this region.
An area of two miles wide and six miles long has been worn away by the eroding agency of water into myriads of conical and pyramidal peaks, high sharp ridges and deep winding canons two hundred and fifty to three hundred feet in depth.
The summits of these ridges are capped with layers of coarse-grained sandstone, containing many whitish particles of clay which have been dissolved out by exposure, and give to the rock the appearance of worm-eaten masses.
We then have underneath the sandstone a yellowish calcareous marl passing down into a light gray grit ; then the flesh-colored Turtle bed with its peculiar fossils.
Most of the same organic remains are found here as at Bear Creek or Ash Grove Spring, but not near so abundant.
A species of land shell, Helix Leidyi, a single specimen of which was discovered at Bear Creek in 1853 by Mr. Meek and the writer, occurs at this locality in great numbers.
Continuing our course down the south bank of White River, we see on our left the main range of the Bad Lands rising high above the surrounding country, and extending in an easterly direction to the head of Teton River, where it ceases abruptly.
On our left as far as the eye can reach we see outliers of the Tertiary exposing their whitened surfaces, and resting upon Cretaceous bed No.
5.
Nearly in a direct line south of Grindstone Hills, and near the dividing ridge between White and Running Water Rivers, we meet with a high outlier of Tertiary called Eagle Nest Hill, from the fact that an eagle has built her nest on its summit from time immemorial.
This hill is about eighty feet in height above the surrounding prairie, with nearly perpendicular sides, composed mostly of indurated clay with a mixture of calcareous matter.
Not far distant is another hill of the same formation, about a mile long, and covered to some extent with pines and capped with a bed of sandstone twenty to thirty feet in thickness.
All around the base of these hills the Cretaceous bed No.
5 is seen with a few of its peculiar fossils.
About ten miles north east of this point, near White River, we meet with a denuded area which presents some peculiarities worthy of note.
Here I observed a vertical seam of fine-grained sandstone passing through the different strata for several hundred yards, varying in thickness from four to thirty inches.
Sometimes this vertical seam is left standing, the more yielding calcareous marl having been washed away from either side, and thus it forms a high jierpendicular wall having much the appearance of mason work.
It is composed of a fine, light gray grit, and is doubtless due to the infiltration of fine sediment in a fissure in the strata.
At this locality we have, in descending order, rather fine grained gray sandstone, then a yellowish or flesh-colored calcareous marl, containing many tough argillo-calcareous concretions.
This forms bed E of vertical section, and contains at this locality numerous remains of turtles and mammals.
Within the space of a mile I saw of turtles — portions more or less entire — more than thirty individuals.
Fragments also of Oreodon, Rhinoceros and several new species of Mammalia, one of which Dr. Leidy has described as Steneofiber Nebrascensis, We continue to see quite numerous isolated patches of this deposit until reaching the forks of White River, below which point they almost entirely cease, and the river cuts deeply through Cretaceous bed No.
5 into No.
4.
The alluvial bottoms are composed of the light-colored clays and sands of the Bad Lands, but the bluffs are formed of the yellow and dark ash(•olored clays of the Cretaceous formation, with a few fossils, as BactiUtes, Ammonites, Inoceramus, S^c.
Passing down the Slissouri River, the next indication of the Tertiary deposit is at Medicine Hills, about eighty miles below Fort Pierre.
These are a lofty group of hills, the upper portions and sides of which are covered with large fragments of rocks, which seem to have been removed from their position by denudation.
This rock holds the same geological position and is similar to that on Bijou Hills, but is, in some instances, of a [June, riner and more compact silicious character, and in others a coarser conglonaerate.
These Hills are of considerable interest, as forming an intermediate link uniting Bijou Hills to the main body of the Bad Lands.
The two upper beds of the vertical section are represented at this locality.
The last outlier of this deposit is seen at Bijou Hills on the opposite side of the Missouri Rivor in lat.
43A°.
These are a group of isolated hills towering high above the surrounding country and forming prominent land marks for the voyager.
The two highest hills border upon the river and are from four to six hundred feet in height.
Farther into the interior are two other hills, the first about two miles long, and the second about eight miles, ranging in a nearly east and west course, sloping gently down toward the Coteau de Prairie.
In the summer of 1853 I ascended one of the hills nearest the river in company with my friend Mr. Meek, and, from a denuded portion near the summit, we obtained several fragments of jaws and teeth belonging to two new species of mammals, which have been described by Dr. Leidy as Ilipparion spcciosum and Merycadus nccaius.
In the autumn of 1856 I discovered on the denuded summits of the same hills Hipparion occidcntalis and two new genera, Leptarctus primus, an animal allied to the raccoon, and MerycMppus insignis, a remarkable new genus of ruminant horse.
These remains have all been described by Dr. Leidy in the Proceedings of the Philadelphi;.

The summits of these hills are capped with a bed of bluish-gray conapact rock, quite variable in its character.
Sometimes it is very fine, not unlike a metamorphic rock ; again it is composed of an aggregation of particles of granular quartz, interspersed with a few small water-worn pebbles; then a coarse grained somewhat friable sandstone.
Farther into the interior, capping the summit of the long hill, this rock may be seen in places twenty to thirty feet in thickness.
The calcareous grits and marls underneath, may be subdivided in descending order thus : — 1st.
— Yellowish-gray grit, with compact, fine calcareous concretions.
'Ind.
— Yellowish-white calcareous marl, containing great quantittes of the comminuted fragments of bones.
3;-c?.
— Compact whitish calcareous clay, with a few vertebrate remains and concreting limestone.
The aggregate thickness of these beds I could not determine, as the sides of the hill were, for the most part, covered with a surface deposit of considerable thickness, sustaining a good growth of vegetation.
The foregoing notes are designed merely as preliminary to a more thorough description of the geological character of this most interesting deposit.
Its Miocene age and the Miocene affinities of most of the genera and species of fossils yet obtained from it have already been discussed in an interesting paper by Prof. Leidy, published in the Proceedings of the Academy for March, also in a paper by F. B. Meek and the writer, published in the Proceedings for April.
The Zoological arrangement of the Catalogue is copied from Prof. Leidy's paper published in March last.
The object of the table is simply to show as far as has been ascertained the stratigraphical position of the different fossils, and the letters are made to correspond with those representing the beds in the vertical section.
The illustrative section accompanying this paper is intended to show the relations of the Tertiary basin to the Cretaceous beds, and especially to render more clear the connections of the widely separated outliers, Medicine Hills and Bijoux Hills with the main body of the Bad Lands.

This singular bivalve inhabits the rivers of "Virginia and probably further south, where the water is brackish, resembling Cyrena in that respect, and it is found in great abundance attached by its byssus to Ostrea Virginiana.
The hinge resembles that of Sepiifer and Breissena, with the addition of a singular cap-shaped, thin, white appendage, which projects obliquely towards the cavity of the valves.
Another species inhabiting St. Domingo has been figured and described by Recluz as Dreissena Domingensis.

Hadbodus priscus, Leidy.
The genus and species are founded upon the fragment of a bone with two teeth, apparently of a Pycnodont fish allied to Placodus, obtained by Dr. William Spillman, from a cretaceous deposit in the neighborhood of Columbus, Mississippi.
The fragment of bone is about IJ inches in depth and breadth, and about ;( of an inch in thickness; is convex on the outer side ; and presents large reserve cavities on the inner side at the base of the two teeth which are coossified with one of the borders of the bone.
The teeth present a remarkable resemblance to premolars of a pachydermatous mammal.
They are quadrate, and are about as broad as they are high, and about half the thickness.
They are bilobed at the triturating surface, which slopes inwardly ; and are invested with smooth enamel, which extends twice the depth externally that it does internally.
The two teeth differ a little in form and size.
Their height externally is 8 lines ; the breadth of one 8 lines ; of the other 7 lines; and the thickness of both is 4 lines, except the distal lobe of the larger tooth which is 5 lines.
'I.
Phasganodus DIR0S, Lcidy.
This genus and species are founded upon a much mutilated dental bone with teeth imbedded in a hard mass of sandstone, discovered in Nebraska, by Dr. F. T. Hayden.
The specimen I suspect to have been obtained from a cretaceous deposit.
The dental bone in its perfect condition has been about 6 inches in length, and 2 inches in depth posteriorly.
To the dentary border, so far as can be ascertained, there have been six large, coossified, sabre-shaped teeth.
The trenchant border is directed outwardly ; and the obtuse, inner, concave border islongitudiually ridged.
The first tooth visible is about | of an inch from the end of the jaw, and has been about 1] inches long.
The second tooth was situated about 1 inch posterior to the first^ and was about f of an inch long.
The third tooth, the best preserved in the specimen, about h an inch behind the second, has a strong conical base, and it is 10 lines long".
The succeeding teeth decrease in size, and are at irregular distances apart.
The specimen I suspect to belong to a scomberoid fish allied to Enchodus.

TuRSEODUs ACUTus, Leidy.
This genus and species are founded upon a left dental bone with teeth pro1857.]
bably of a ganoid fish, which I obtained from the black shale, of what have been usually considered the triassic rocks, from near Phoenixville, Chester Co., Pa.
The dental bone is 20 lines long, by 4 lines in depth posteriorly.
It is straight, and its outer surface is covered with fine, interrupted ridges, such as are observed upon small ganoid scales, found in the same series of rocks at Gwynned, on the North Pennsylvania Railroad.
Upon the dental border of the specimen there may be counted the remains of 20 teeth, situated at irregular distances apart.
They have measured from ^ to 1 line long.
They are columnar in form, slightly curving inward ; have a spreading base ; and an abrupt, conical, enamel summit.
The fish may be allied to Belonostomus or Eugnathus, but I am unable to ascertain the exact form of the teeth in these genera.

Examination of ENABGITE from New Grenada.
BY WM.
J. TAYLOR.
I received from Jos.
A. Clay, Esq., a fellow member of the Academy, a raiceral which proves on examination to be Enargite.
Mr. Clay received this in a box of minerals from South America; it was labelled " an antimonial silver ore from the mines of Santa Anna, New Grenada ;" there were several other minerals accompanying it from the same locality.
Enargite was, I believe, first found in the Cordilleras of Peru, and mineralogists were surprised a few weeks since by Dr. Genth's determining a small specimen of a mineral found by the State Geologist of South Carolina, Oscar M. Leiber, Esq., from the " Brewers' Mine," to be of the same species.
(" Contributions to Mineralogy," by Dr. F. A. Genth, American Journ.
Sci.
and Arts, May, 1857, p.
420.)
The fact of its occurring at another locality will not be without interest.
The structure of the massive portion of the mineral is columnar, and it is intermixed with a quartose rock and pyrites, in which small cavities occur, filled with the crystalled Enargite, some of which are very distinct.
The Enargite is very brittle, its color a greyish black with streaks of the same color ; the powdered mineral is very crystalline with a metallic lustre.
Before the blowpipe it decrepitates ; on charcoal, gives the odor of arsenic and a very slight incrustation of antimony ; with carbonate of soda, gives hepar and metallic copper.
The analysis I made in the laboratory of Dr. F. A. Genth, from a small portion of the perfectly pure massive mineral, of which O*7082 grammes wprttreated with aqua regia and gave the following results ; Per cent.

BY JOHN LECONTE.
The two first species described below, were handed to me by our associate Dr. Mitchell, as coming from New Granada in Central America.
The other I received from JVlr.
Cassin, who informed me that it was given to him as a native of Peru.
I have not been able to discover that they have ever yet been described by any naturalist, at least our very extensive library furnishes no book in which any thing like them is mentioned; therefore I do not hesitate to consider them as new.
Should they prove not to be so, they are willingly and freely given up to the naturalist who has been so fortunate as to see them before me ; with a regret, however, that I have been guilty of adding a synonym to that mass of rubbish accumulated by the negligence or design of others.
Phyllostoma ttnicolor.
Upper fore teeth 2 — 2 ; the exterior ones very small, scarcely perceptible in the living animal ; the two intermediate ones somewhat serrated at the base, but converging at the point so as to meet; lower four approximate, crowded, emarginate.
Head large ; snout elongated ; nose-leaf sessile, but appearing pedicellate from the inflexion of the sides of the base, ovato-lanceolate, entire, with two perpendicular striae, the included portion rather tumid ; horse-shoe (as it is called) or addition to the base of the fore part with five blunt teeth on each side on the outer edge.
Upper and under lip with a row of small warts in front.
Ears ovate, blunt, with a slight exterior dilatation of the hinder part of the base, orillon triangular, more or less dentate on the outer edge.
Tail none.
Interferaoral membrane very narrow, very deeply and roundly emarginate, being little more than a kind of narrow membranous wing between the legs, with a small interior basal tooth, formed by the protension of the tarsal bone.

I have to ask indulgence for introducing into the above descriptions some characters which are not specific, but strictly generic.
But the arrangement of the Vespertilionidae is by no means such as can be admitted by any considerate naturalist, it therefore became necessary to include these generic characteristics in the two first species, as no deterrainate generic description of the genus Phyllostoma has yet been given.

Lcpiomeryx is perhaps at most only subgenerically distinct from Dorcatherium.
Some fragments of jaws with teeth, obtained by Dr. F. V. Hayden, prove that the large tubercle, which is described as rising out of the base internally of the upper true molars, in a specimen of the skull of the same animal, is an inconstant character, and independent of this, the molar teeth of Leptomeryx and Dorcatherium are identical in form.
Seplemher 1st, 1857.
Vice-President Bridges in the Chair.
Dr. Leidy remarked that there appeared to exist a general misconception in regard to the dentition of the 3Iososaurus.
The animal is almost universally called an acrodont reptile, or one in which the teeth are inserted upon, or are co-ossified with, the border of the jaws.
A number of specimen^ of teeth and fragments of jaws, in the museum of the Academy, prove this appellation to be incorrect.
The teeth oi Mososauriis have a recurved pyramidal crown, and a more massive, vertically oblong root, which is often twice the length of the crown.
The root is inserted for three-fourths of its extent into a correspondingly deep socket, witli the sides of which it is co-ossified.
The centre of the teeth is occupied by a fusiform pulp cavity, communicating with one or more vascular canals passing through the fang.
In the reproduction of the teeth, it appears the new ones commence to be developed attached to the gum, on the postero-internal side of the alveoli.
As they proceed, they penetrate into the latter, by exciting an absorption of the substance of the fang of the old teeth in a direction obliquely outward and forward.
The cavity for the new tooth increases in size at the expense of the substance of the fang of the old one.
The pulp cavity of the old tooth, in consequence of the ossification of its pulp, appears to recede before the increasing cavity of the new tooth.
The latter cavity finally makes a communication with the former, though this .appears not always to be the case ; and subsequently the fang of the old tooth becomes so completely excavated as to form a mere capsule, from which its crown is brolcen away, or shed, through comparatively little violence.
In the further progress of the newly protruding tooth, the osseous capsule formed from the fang of the old tooth is gradually obliterated, except a portion which remains as a partition frona the next alveolus.
[September, Dr. Leidy stated that a few evenings since, in the yard attached to his residence, he for the first time had the opportunity of observing the male Treecricket, Oecanthiis, while chirping.
The sound, as is well known, is produced by the insect elevating its wings and vibrating them laterally ; by which movement the edge of one wing-cover is rubbed upon a rasp or crepitaculum of the other.
The sound is like that of the Field-cricket, Ackela, instead of a peculiar one &3 Dr. L. had supposed it to be.
The note he had formerly attributed to the Tree-cricket, and with which the woods are vocal during the nights of this season of the year, is one resembling that produced by the quick and repeated snapping of the end of a quill pen or tooth-pick during a second or two of time.
Upon examination Dr. L. found this sound to proceed from the male Katy-did.
Platj/p/n/llum ; and the mechanism producing it is similar to the stridulating apparatus of the crickets, Acheta, Oecanthus.
In the male Katy-did, the crepitaculum, situated on the under surface of the dorsal portion of the wing covers, consists of a transverse, fusiform, concave ridge, provided with about fifty serratures ; and is best developed in the left wing cover.
The instrument which rubs against this crepitaculum is the sharp, elevated, inner edge of the dorsal portion of the wing covers, at the side of what might be considered a trilateral tambourine, which is best developed in the right wing cover.
The song (if the term may be used) of the male Katy-did ordinarily is produced by the sharp edge on the inner side of the tambourine of the right wing cover, rubbing against the rasp or crepitaculum of the left wing cover.
Dr. L. continued, he had always supposed the male Katy-did produced the familiar sound after which the insect is named, and that the female was silent.
This he believed was the generally received opinion ; and Dr. Thad.
Wm.
Harris (Insects Injurious to Vegetation, page 138), remarks that at night " the joyous males begin the tell-tale call."
Dr. L. added, after further investigation he was happy to be able to clear the male from the libellous imputation, and that, as was usually the case among our own race, the accusation, recrimination, and denial, of katy-did, katy-didn't, came from the female herself.
The apparatus by which the female Katy-did tells her tale is totally different from that of the male, though situated as in this, in the dorsal portion of the wing covers.
In the dorsal portion of the right wing cover between the marginal vein, and another about half a line from it, there are about five strong transverse veins and some smaller ones, provided upon their upper surface each with a row of strong spines bent back at right angles.
All other portions of the right and the whole of the left wing cover are destitute of such spines.
In the left wing cover, the corresponding position to that just described is occupied by a fine rete of veins as elsewhere ; and it is the inner edge of this wing cover rubbing against the hooks of the right one.
which produces the tell-tale sound of katy-did, katy-didn't.

Dr. J.
A. Meigs read part of a letter from Mr. J. Judson Barclay, dated Philadelphia, Aug. 21, 1857, accompanying the flattened skull presented by him this evening. "
On referring to my journal, (kept during several years residence in Jerusalem,) I find a brief mention of the circumstances attending the discovery of the very singular skull now in your possession, though I fear it will afford but little aid in assigning any other place of habitation to this unfortunate adventurer, than the subterranean locum tenens of his bones.
The immense quarry-cave, in whicli this skeleton was found, it was our good fortune to discover in 1853, and by the connivance of one of the chief dignitaries of the city, we eluded the vigilance of the Turkish authorities, and succeeded in making a thorough exploration of this hitherto unknown cavern.
The skeleton of this adventurous explorer (if such he may be styled) was found in the extreme South end of the cave, 100 feet from the entrance, in a deep pit.
The bones (of almost giant proportions) gave evidence of having laid in that position for many years, judging from their decayed state, which, however, is not so apparent upon the skull.
How long since he ended his career, though matter of some uncertainty, is obviously no short time, for it is evident that the bats and owls have fluttered over his bones for many long centuries ; for the entrance to this large quarry-cave is in the wall of the city, which undoubtedly has been kept carefully closed ever since the subversion of the Frank kingdom of the Holy Land, when the city walls underwent their last reparation.
The position of this cave, a little elevated above the area of the temple, enabled us to solve an enigma which has heretofore been regarded as an ' opprohimn antiquorum,' — the location of those Cyclopean stones, in their great height in the outer temple wall.
What may be his history, is a still greater matter of uncertainty.
We can only conjecture that he was a pilgrim, who, on exploring the labyrinthine halls of this vast grotto, stumbled down into this deep pit, but whether Jew, Christian or Moslem, is altogether matter of query."

The following extract of a letter from Dr. D. B. McCartee, of Ningpo, China, dated New York, Sept. 3d, 1857, was read : " I forward a specimen of the ' insect wax' of China.
This was said by the naturalists attached to Sir George Staunton's embassy to be the product of the larva of the Cicada limbata, and that ' the fly' which ' was observed by Staunton on the coast of Cochin China has curious pectinated appendages on the back, and the whole insect is covered with a white powder, which is imparted to the stems of the plants it inhabits.'
This is not the case with the wax of which a specimen is sent.
It is the product of a very small insect, a species of Coccus.
as far as I could make it out.
It is deposited near Ningpo on the twigs and smaller branches of a species of ash, in granules, giving the twig the appearance of white coral.
It is not generally known that it is to be found in the vicinity of Ningpo ; and it was only after a search of two years that I succeeded in finding it.
* * * "^ * I think Sir George Staunton was deceived by the fact that the larva of a species of Cicada corresponding to his description is found upon the same tree, as I myself saw."

Observations on the Wild Turkey, or GALLOPAVO SYLVESTRIS, of Eay.
BY JOHN LECONTE.
"Whoever has compared the Wild Turkey of the United States with the doluestic.
animal of the s.ame genus, must have observed that there existed very striking differences between them.
These differences do not consist of slight and unimportant i)articularities, but in radical disagreements, which ought to remain unchangeable under all circumstances, and which form good specific characteristics.
In the tame bird, the colors vary infinitelj^, and in the wild one, very considerably.
The great mark of distinction is in the enormous palear or dewlap of the former, which extends from the base of the lower mandible to the large caruncles on the lower part of the neck.
Whatever alterations may have been produced by long domestication, this palear could not have been formed by an enlargement of the rather loose skin of the neck.
It is a specific character, which as in our own bird is not found in the Meleagris ocellata of Honduras.
It has been observed by my son in a former number of our Proceedings, that all derivative variations are monstrosities, and take place chiefly in those parts, which in a normal state of existence, are impossible in the genus, as we observe in hornless beeves and tailless cats, in feather-crested fowls and solid-footed swine.
The conviction that these two birds were really distinct species has long existed in my mind : more than fifty years ago, when I first saw a Wild Turkev, I 1857.]
was led to conclude that one never could have been produced from the other.
I have mentioned this to many ornithologists, but no one would take the trouble to investigate the matter.
At length Mr. Gould, one of the best ornithologists of Eurojje, in the 304th number of the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of England, has made the discovery, that there have been two species confounded together under the name of Meleagris gallopavo.
He calls his species M. mexicana having received it from Mexico.
I cannot determine from his description, whether it is different from ours, or is the original of the domestic bird.
Mr. Gould confines himself entirely to a description of its colors, a very imperfect method of discriminating species.
He mentions nothing of the existence or nonexistence of the palear, nor of the frontal caruncle so long and extensible in the one, so short in the other.
I am however inclined to believe, that his species differs in no manner from our native species.
He quotes Brisson as describing his bird, {Brisson, Synopsis Methodica Avium, Vol.
1, p. 158,) and states that Linnaeus's description of M. gallopavo is founded on Brisson's Gallopavo sylvestris and Ray's New England Wild Turkey [Synopsis Aviicm ei Piscium, page 51, No.
3).
Brisfon describes and figures the domestic animal : to prove this more fully T quote his words.
He says " palea longa sub gutture pendula.
Une membrane charnue longitudinale pendante sous la gorge."
He mentions afterwards among the Varieties, le Dindon sauvage or Gallopavo sylvestris Novae Anglise of Ray.
I omit any description of these two birds.
Sufficiently detailed accounts of them have already been published, and shall merely observe that the Wild Turkey has been very minutely described by the Prince of Canino in his American Ornithology.
It may not be amiss to add here some observations on the introduction of the Turkey into Europe.
It appears that the earliest visitors to the tropical regions of America observed the Turkey both wild and in a state of domestication.
The natives therefore had been able to tame them ; their transportation to foreign countries was thus rendered easy.
In about thirty years after the first landing of Columbus in America they are mentioned as birds newly introduced into Europe.
The province of Yucatan is particularly mentioned as the place where they were first observed, but I cannot find them mentioned as being cultivated in Spain previous to the year 1520.
This may in some measure be owing to the want of Spanish publications of that early date, or at least of translations into the English language of any that may have appeared.
We copy the English in thinking that the Spanish have no literature worth noticing : whereas three centuries ago they were far beyond other European nations in literature as well as in all the arts and sciences which adorn or benefit a state of civilization.
If we could obtain all that was written and published in those days relative to this portion of the globe, much of the absurd and false relations of modern historians would be treated with the neglect they well deserve.
It is a remarkable circumstance in the history of Europe, that the rera of the introduction of many important articles of domestic use even in more modern times, is entirely unknown.
No one has ever thought it worth while to record the date of the introduction of the Turkey, of Tobacco or of the Potato, into the other continent from the foreign countries where they were first found.
In the case of the latter vegetable which has done so much good in the world, and has in fact altered the dietetic habits of whole nations, no one has been able to discover whence it came, or by whom it was first introduced to the notice of civilized men.
I scarcely notice the story of its having been brought by Sir Walter Raleigh from North Carolina, as it could not grow naturally in that country, and he never sat foot on the soil of North America.
The peculiar habits of an animal which strongly resembles another, are frequently suflicient when joined to even slight corporeal characters to distinguish it from others.
I have before observed that the Turkey was found domesticated among the nations of Central America.
Now the bird which we have native among us never has been domesticated.
All attempts to conquer its peculiar [September, habits have failed, notwithstanding what has been said and written to the contrary.
I defy any one to show a Turkey, even of the first generation, produced from a pair hatched from the eggs of a wihl hen.
We have every j-ear in our markets offered for sale, birds of a very dark color, and in some «legree resembling the wild species : but in every instance by the presence of the palear, the imposition can be detected at first sight and the cheat exposed.
1 have known the eggs found in the woods hatched by a domestic hen, the chickens brought up carefully, and rendered so tame and familiar as to eat out of the hand, and to shew considerable pleasure whenever persons with whom tiicy were acquainted approached them.
Yet they never would associate witli the domestic turkies, studiously avoiding tlicir company, and in little more than a year running off to the woods, and never again returning to the haunts of their infancy.
I know that I shall be contradicted in this statement, and many quotations from authors brought forward against me.
I repeat, contrary to the assertions of many others, that no one has ever succeeded in domesticating our Wild Turkey ; I speak not only from my own personal observations, but from the undivided testimony of many southern gentlemen.
The Turkey of our own poultry yards, which when young is difficult to bring forward, it was thought might be obtained of a hardier race, by a new domestication : but every attempt has failed, nor can I find a single well-aiithenticated case of a mixed breed being obtained.

This curious Helix differs from any hitherto known.
It is readily distinguished by a white, shining discoidal shell, curious aperture and internal teeth.
The upper surface is composed of six whorls, five of which regularly increase from the spire, which is slightly elevated; the last is proportionally very wide, inflated, and elevated above the others, almost to a level with the apex.
Below, one full ventricose whorl is visible, and more than half of another, which rapidly decreases until it becomes lost in the small umbilicus.
The aperture is oblique, basin-shaped, furnished with four teeth ; of these one on the parietal wall connecting the extremities of the peristome is broad, excavated^ in the middle, angular, resembling that of H. Troostiana, Lea, (plicata, Say) ; on the basal portion of the peristome is another, situated on the edge, perpendicular and short; on the right lip, slightly removed within the aperture, are two slight elongated laminai, running horizontally, the lower one raised above the whorl for some distance, thus forming a slender, spear-like point.
Behind the teeth on the outer whorl are two pits, between which the shell is pinched into a sharp ridge joining the peristome.

I have compared it to Mr. Lea's type, and find it to be quite distinct.
The latter is not perforated and has a very different arrangement of teeth.
That H. Loisa is not a less developed specimen of H. Couchiana is shown by the fact of its being twice the size.
Mr. Lea's shell has the parietal tooth more angular, flexuose, and entering farther into the aperture ; the teeth on the right lip are not horizontal, heavier and longer, and extend to the edge of the peristome, where they are very solid and elevated, while in io/sa they are slender laminee, removed within the aperture.

Animal iwice the length of the diameter of the shell ; color reddish.
Mr. J. H. Thompson, of New Bedford, Mass., proposes this name for a shell found by him living in considerable quantities.
The circumstances in which it was discovered are very unfavorable to the supposition of its having been brought from abroad.
The chances of a Dalmatian shell having been introduced into California, and already multiplying there, are very small indeed.
At the same time the shell before me bears strong resemblance to the European group of this type.
It seems to be between H. albanica, Ziegler, and acies, Partsch ; the carina be.ng less sharp than in the latter.
Mr. Thomson suggests that it may have been imported from the Sandwich Islands on vegetables, but there is no species native to that region which bear any resemblance to this.

It with some hesitation that I propose a name for this shell.
I at first considered is as a bandless variety of Californicnsis, Lea.
But on expressing this opinion to Mr. Thompson, he gave me the above description of the animal and its habits, which are quite distinct from those of Mr. Lea's shell.
Its characteristics were found constant at various remote points of the State, and in a considerable number of specimens.
They seem too great for a simple variety.
The animal is also different in its habits from Californiensis, being found only solitary, while the latter is gregarious.
The shell is one of the very few bandless species of California.

To Mr. J. H. Thomson I am also indebted for the following interesting notes on this shell.
It will be very important to dissect the animal, as it may prove generically distinct from Helix.
"Animal twice as long as the breadth of the shell, dark slate color, almost black on the head and tentacles; a black line running along each side of the back from the base of the longer tentacles; body covered with compressed granules; tentacles black, acutely pointed : eyes at the base of superior tentacles ; anatomy believed to resemble, somewhat, that of the Lyraniadse.
Gregarious; in its habits resembling Lymnaea, being found always near water, and laying its eggs on the water-cresses and other aquatic plants.
Arrives at maturity in one year, one half the time required by the other species."

Thomson for a fine specimen of this rare species, the only one I have ever seen.

This shell, though never seen by Mr. Say, is called by one of his names.
It is certainly a disadvantage to increase the already burthensome nomenclature, but is it not worse to make one name serve for two distinct species ?
Mr. Say's shell was found by Mr. J. S. Phillips at the 8 mile lane above Philadelphia, and is still preserved in his collection.
I think it will prove to be distinct from chersina, Say.
The latter has a much moreelevate(i spire, rounded at the top like labyrinthica, Say, and is only obtusely carinated ; while in egena.
Say, a very acute carina divides the shell into a short, pyramidal, sharp spire, and a rounded, inflated base, whose outline forms a semicircle.
As I consider H. egena a good species, I leave it to Dr. Gould to propose another name for the Florida shell.
Helix fallax, Say, is certainly more than a variety of tridentata, Say.
Not only are the characteristic differences well marked, but the habits of the respective animals are different.
Mr. J. G. Anthony tells me that tridentata is found on hill sides in the grass, vf\\i\Q fallax inhabits rich soils, in woods, under logs, and is not gregarious like the former.
The difficulty is to mark the dividing line between the many varieties of fallax, some of which are quite as distinct as H. Hopetonensis, Shuttl.
In one specimen oi fallax in my cabinet there is a well developed "fulcrum" as in monodou, spinosa, and others mentioned by Mr. Lea.
Helix minutissima, Lea, is certainly distinct from H. minuscula, Binney.
Had my father been spared to finish his work, he would have withdrawn the opinion expressed in Vol.

I have a note of his taken at Mr. Lea's house, in which he says they are distinct.

That this shell is identical with cellaria, Miill., was the opinion of Dr. Binney.
I am able to add to the same effect the testimony of two of our first conchologists, Mr. J. G. Anthony and Dr. Griffith.
The former tells me that thirty years ago he found a shell in considerable numbers in his garden, at Providence, R. I., in all respects agreeing with the European cellaria.
On carrying it to Philadelphia, the conchologists of that time all called it glaphyra.
Say.
The testimony of Dr. Grifiith is still more conclusive.
I have a letter of his to my father in which he says that he had seen Say's type oi glaphyra in the collection of the Academy, and that it was certainly the cellaria of Europe.
He adds, that when arranging the collection, the shell was broken and thrown aside.

In Florida there are several varieties of this shell as well worthy of specific distinction as microdonta, Desh., volvoxis, Parr, and delitescens, Shuttl.
Miihlfeldt's name cereolus has priority, having been published in ISUi, and not 1818as quoted by Pfeirfer, &c. The European conchologists, Pfeiffer, Reeve, &c., mention as a synonym of this shell H. polygyrata, Binney, a name not even mentioned by him.

This is certainly H. vortex, Pf., of the West Indies.
I do not agree with Dr. Gould, (p. 34,) in considering H. tenuistriata, fJinney, as the same shell; a comparison of ihe description of the latter will show them to be distinct.
The geographical distribution is also very different.
Dr. Binney's shell is from Tennessee, while vortex, is a West Indian species, introduced only into the Southern extremity of Florida.

Helix lucdbrata.
Say.
I have lately found among the shells of the Academy three specimens of a shell labelled many years ago, " Jlelix lucubrala, Say — Mexico."
I have made a very critical comparison of them with authentic specimens of II.
caduca, Pf., received through the kindness of Mr. Cuming.
I am now confirmed in the opinion I expressed before, that the two shells are undoubtedly identical.
The resemblance of these Mexican shells to II.
fuliginosa, Binney, is strong enough to have given Dr. Griffith the impression that they were the [Octoberj same.
He expressed himself to that effect in letters to my father.
From Dr. Griffith, Prof. Adams may have received the same imj)ression (sec Vt.
Moll.)
I am inclined to differ from them, believing the sijccies, though nearly allied, to be quite distinct.
Until we receive the true II.
fuUyinosa from the South-western States, 1 shall doubt its existence there.
Our country has been too little searched, however, to allow us to draw very nicely the lines of geographical distribution.
If I am correct in my view of this species, Mr. Say's name will, of course, take precedence over that of Dr. Pfeittcr.

Mr.

They appear to have been rejected by the workmen when selectino: the lime.
November 10<7i, 1857.
Mr. Cassin in the Chair.
Dr. Morris called the attention of members to an appearance of the eastern horizon just before, at and after sunset.
On any clear evening, after a warm day, a person looking towards the east a few minutes before sunset, will observe a red band of light extending along the whole horizon; above, it is gradually shaded into yellow light, which passes into greenish, and finally into blue, at various distances from the zenith.
As the sun decends in the west, these bands of red and yellow light rise in the east, until the red makes an angle of about 15° with the plane of the horizon, leaving a clear dark blue space beneath.
The colors are brightest about ten minutes after apparent sunset : after which they gradually fade away.
A cloudy or misty state of the atmosphere near the zenith of the observer obscures or prevents the occurrence of the phenomenon : but a fog-bank in the horizon does not interfere.
In Kaemtz's Meteorology, translated by Walker, page 408, the same phenomenon is partially described, but he places the " white or yellow stripe '' between the red and the blue of the horizon, or below the red.
I have never seen it anywhere but as above.
Kaemtz thinks that the blue is due to the shadow of the earth projected against the eastern sky, while the red 1857.]
baad is caused by the absorption of the other constituents of white light in traversing so great an amount of atmosphere.
This hypothesis is also maintained by Mr. Martin in his Notes, F. p. 497 : and he gives a much fuller and better account of the phenomenon as observed in morning twilight by M. Bravais from the summit of the Faulhorn.
If it were really due to this cause.
no reason could be assigned for the gradual fading and disappearance, first of the yellow and then of the red light, when they have risen about 20° above the horizon ; they ought to follow the sun completely across the sky.
I believe the phenomenon to be due to the formation of an iris by the sun's light falling on the vapor of the atmosphere which has become partially condensed as the sun has receded ; probably this will be found to correspond with the iris given by five internal reflections and two refractions of the sun's rays.

Mr. Cassia read the following extract from a letter of Mr. P. B. DuChaillu.
Fernando Paz River, August 11 Ih, 1857. "
While hunting after the Gorilla a few days ago, I met with a male surrounded by a few females.
The male has a red crest, like a cock.
"Both the guinea fowl and the black pheasant are birds which are not seen before you reach fifty or sixty nailes in the interior, and are unknown to the natives of the sea shore.
The birds of the Fernando I'az country, until you reach the interior, are exactly the same as those of Cape Lopez, the country being similar in appearance.
At the Cape properly there is no town : the largest town of the Cape Lopez people is Sangatonga, situated in the bay formed by the Cape.
It is the residence of the king, and is situated in a beautiful prairie at the foot of a hill rising about two miles in the interior.
The soil of Cape Lopez is generally light and sandy ; the country presents an aspect quite different from that between Fernando F6 and the Gaboon, looking a good deal like the countries of Southern Africa toward the Cape of Good Hope — large prairies with groves of trees.
In these groves the Cape Lopez people have their plantations, as the soil is good.
Sweet potatoes, cassada, plantain, ground nuts and sugar cane are the products.
They plant in pretty large quantities, as these form the main staple of their food; sweet potatoes, especially, grow well.
Good roads could easily be made, and would be a powerful aid to colonization.
The raising of cattle could be made a profitable business, for the prairie land would afford good grazing.
A good many wild cattle are seen wandering over the [November, prairies.
Water seemed to be rather scarce, haviop met, during a journey of sixty miles into the interior, but four streams : but the natives liave assured mithat at the bottoms of the hills in the midst of the groves there are a good many brooks.
So fur as I have been into the interior I found the country hilly : 1 did not meet with marshy ground but at a single place, and that marsh was small.
About fifty miles in the interior the prairies become smaller and woods take their place.
The country through which I passed was thinly populated: the people have generally to stay on or near the Gaboon or Nazareth rivers or their tributaries.
This want of population would be a drawback to colonization, as would also the want of a good harbor.
The country near the Nazareth if.
better off in this respect."

Color sooty, approaching to black; top of head ashy brown, formed by the whitish tips of the feathers.
In front of the eye a small semicircular space of black, over and in front of which is a line of gray ; chin and throat dusky ; tips of small feathers on the shoulder grayish, also those of the undertail coverts : eyes black.
Length 6| inches, extent of wings 17 inches, from metacarpal joint to end of wing 6| inches, tarsus .54 of an inch.
Toes long and slender and armed with long, sharp claws.
Found at Simiahmo Bay, Puget Sound, near the 49th parallel of latitude, Washington Territory, July 1857.
Male.
This species is readily distinguished from any heretofore known to inhabit North America, by its large size, the form of the tail, and the absence of the [November, sharp termiaal points of the tail featliers.
It has also longer and more slender toes.
A number of these birds •were observed for several evenings flying near our camp in company with large numbers of Cypselus Vuuxii.
They kept for the greater part near the edge of the forest, and generally flew so high as to be out of the reach of shot of any usual size.
One specimen was obtained, which is a male, in apparently adult plumage, and is described above.

Vice-President Bridges in the Chair.
A communication was received from M. Belhomme, Chef du Javdin Botanique de Metz, (Moselle,) detailing some investigations made by him with reference to a carmine obtained from Monarda didijmia, and a new alkaloid from Atropa beUddonna, called by him Bclladonnine ; which was referred to the Committee on Proceedings.
A letter was received from E. B. Plympton, dated Providence, R. I., Nov. 27th, 1858, announcing the decease of Dr. W. Blanding, late a Correspondent of the Society.
Mr. Cassin and Dr. Hays remarked on Dr. Blanding's devotion to Natural History, and the interests of the Academy.
The following papers were presented : Description of several new North American Reptiles, by E. Hallowell, M. D. Intended for publication in the Proceedings.
Descriptions of Exotic Genera and Species of the Family Unionidas, by Isaac Lea, LL.
D. Intended for the Journal.
Which were referred to the Committees, as usual.
Dr. J.
A. Meigs announced the death, at Panama, on the 16th inst., of Mr. Geo.
R. Gliddon, late a correspondent of the Academy.
On leave granted, Dr. Leidy offered the following resolutions, which were seconded by Mr. AV.
Parker Foulke : Resolved, That the members of the Academy have learned with deep regret Ihe death of their late Correspondent, Geo.
R. Gliddon, Esq., by whom the subject of Egyptian antiquities was first made familiar to the public mind of the United States ; through whose services mainly, our late President, Dr. Morton, received those indispensable materials for his work on Egyptian Craniology, which now enrich the Museum of the Academy ; and whose indefatigable efforts were constantly given towards promoting a rapid interchange of information l>etween the learned of both hemispheres, upon subjects of leading imj)ortance iu Natural History.
Resolved, That the members of the Academy desire to bear witness to the extraordinary and disinterested zeal manifested by Jlr.
Gliddon, during the period of his personal connection with the labors of this Institution; and to his sincere and ardent pursuit of what appeared to his own judgment as scientific truth ; and they also desire to record their appreciation of the kind and friendly relations which it was his constant and successful endeavor to maintain with them.
Resolved, That the members of the Academy tender to the beloved wife of Mr. Gliddon, his companion and aid in much of his valuable labor, their most respectful and hearty sympathy.
Which were unanimously adopted.

Dr. Bridges announced the death of Mr. Chas.
McEuen, late a member of the Academy.
Dr. Leidj called the attention of the members to a bottle containing numerous specimens of a large species of Gordius discovered by Dr. Wra.
A. Hammond, 525 miles west of Fort Riley, Kansas Territory.
Dr. Hammond states they were found in a pond in great numbers, in company with Siredon.
They swam actively forward an inch or two beneath the surface of the water, and occasionally lifted the anterior end even above the latter.
The collection contains 24 females and the same number of males.
The females are cylindrical, light brown of various shades, shining, iridescent ; anterior extremity narrowed ; head surrounded with a dark brown ring ; tail obtuse, slightly compressed, with a terminal genital pore The males are darker colored than the females ; tail extremity more or less spirally enrolled, with the extremity bifurcated ; forks divergent, incurved, smooth, connected at base anteriorly by a crescentic fold, in advance of which is the genital pore ; head as in the female.
The females measure from 10 inches in length by ^ of a line thick, to 2 feet 6 inches in length and 3-5ths of a line thick ; the males 8 inches in length by \ of a line thick, to 2 feet 2 inches in length by 2-5ths of a line thick.
Dr. Leidy next directed the attention of the members to a bottle containing seven specimens of the larva of a species of Oestrus or bot-fly.
They were obtained by Dr. Hammond from a pouched rat, Thomomys borealis, at Bridger's Pass, on the summit of the Rocky Mountains, July 1857.
Dr. Hammond found the rat panting on the road side, without power of escaping.
The bots were found situated beneath the skin of the back, belly, and thigh.
The body of these larvoB is oblong oval, compressed, incurved ; head minute, composed of a transverse pair of papillary eminences, each supporting two minute ocelli, and having j^rojecting from beneath, forward and downward, a pair of strong black hooks.
Spiracular lamina trilobed and marked with vermicular lines.
Segments of the body closely covered with discoidal corneous tubercles, of which the anterior ones have their posterior border projecting and dentated.
The smallest is light yellowish brown ; and as they become larger they assume a darker tint.
The largest are black, hard, shining and remarkably shagreened in appearance.
Length of the smallest larva 5 lines, breadth 3 lines, thickness 2^ lines ; length of largest 9 lines, breadth 5^ lines, thickness 3 lines.
December StJi, 1857.
Vice-President Bridges in the Chair.
Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to a drawing of a curious animalcule, found attached to stones and dead stems of plants in the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers.
The animal, though closely allied in structure to the Rotatoria or wheel animalcules, yet possesses no rotary or other ciliated apparatus.
The body is regularly oval, transparent, colorless, and finely tuberculated.
From the anterior truncated extreniitj^ of the body, the animal projects and retracts at will a delicate cup-shaped membrane about half the size of the body.
The membrane exhibits delicate and distant longitudinal and circular muscular fibres, which are branching.
At the bottom of the cup the mouth communicates with a capacious stomach, and this with a muscular gizzard with lateral jaws, as in most rotifers, and which, as in these, are constantly in motion.
From the gizzard opens a second stomach, Avhich communicates with a short intestine terminating in a posterior anal aperture.
The digestive apparatus is attached to the outer tunic of the body by diverging muscles.
The visceral cavity usuall}contains numerous eggs in various stages of develoi)ment, from that containing the germinal vesicle to such as contain the fully formed ennbryos.
Attached to the inner surface of the body are a number of opaqne, white, irregularly oval bodies.
[December, The size of the animalcule is about tlicl-5th of a line ia diameter.
It appears to be permanently lixcJ to the positions in wliicli it is found.
When disturbed, it folds up its oral cup like an umbrella and retracts it within tlie body.
By means of it, it catches its prey, which consists of smaller animalcules.
From the stomach of one individual I squeezed out as many as fifty of the latter.
For the genus and species the name Dictyophora vorax is proposed.

A paper was presented for publication in the Proceedings, entitled " Prodromus Descriptionis Animaliuiu Invertebratoruui quae in Expeditione ad Oceanuni Pacificum Septentrioualem aRepublica Federata missa, Cadwalladcro Ringgold et Johanne Rodgers ducibus, observavit et descripsit W. Stimpsou, Pars Tcrtia," which was referred to a Committee.
Mr. Lea exhibited the plates accompauyiug his paper, recently presented to the Acadfciuy, on fresh water Naiades collected in Siam, &c., by Dr. House, at the suggestion of Mr. ILiines and others of New York.
Seven!
of the specimens are very similar to our own species from the valley of the Ohio.
A specimen from Australia much resembles the U, Ilopetoneusis, Lea, from Southern Georgia.
December 22d, 1857.
Vice President Bridges in the Chair.
A paper was presented for publication in the Proceedings, entitled " Observations on a Group of Fossil Shells found in Tippah Co., Miss., with descriptions of fifty-five new species," by T. A. Conrad, which was referred to a Committee.
Mr. Lea stated, in presenting a specimen to the Academy, that he had visited the locality at Braintree, 10 miles south of Boston, where specimens of large Trilohites have been recently found.
The attention of Prof. W. B. Rogers was called, some fifteen months since, to "this unique and most interesting locality,'' by Peter Wainwright, Esq., residing in the neighborhood.
Mr. Lea agreed entirsly with Prof. Rogers in placing this formation among the more ancient of the Paleozoic jteriods.
It lies directly on the granite rocks, or rather it is squeezed in and is embraced by these rocks, (on the east and west sides,) which are disturbed by an upheaval.
The formation here is about three hundred yards wide, and lies in a south-east direction.
In examination of the quarry, Mr. Lea was kindly assisted by the owner, Mr. E. Hayward, who now carefully preserves the best specimens which are brought to light.
He pointed out to Mr. Lea the parts of the quarry where most of the specimens were found, and where some impressions were still remaining in place on the surfaces of the stratification.
These surfaces dipped to the south 68°.
The rock consists of a very hard, gray, slaty sandstone, frequently breaking into irregular cross fractures.
The Trilobitcio\in& here is of great interest.
It belongs to the genus Paradozides, and is no doubt the same as described by Prof. Green many years since, under the name of P. IJarlani, of which there is a cast in the collection of the Academy, and which, on comparison with the specimen now presented, proves to be undoubtedly identical.
Barande describes and figures several species of the genus Paradoxides from the lower Silurian of Bohemia, which are closely allied to this, and prove conclusively that the strata must be nearly if not precisely on the same horizon.

Dr. Hammond introduced Major "Wayne, U. S. A., recently engaged in the effort to domesticate the camel in Texas.
Major Wayne said : It gives me pleasure, Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Academy of Natural Sciences, to comply with the request of my friends, and make a lew remarks before you this evening, upon the experiment of introducing the Camel into America.
I esteem the opportunity offered fortunate, as I desire to enlist your interests and sympathies in an undertaking possessing scientific interest, and as I believe great practical benefit, prospectively, for our country.
I may not be able to add any thing to your Zoological knowledge, but I may inform you of our purposes, and hope to secure the co-operation of a society so influential and progressive as is yours.
There have been previous attempts to introduce the Camel into the Western Hemisphere, into South America, Mexico, the island of Jamaica, and according to Mr. D. J. Browne, of the Patent Office, into our own Virginia in the year 1701.
Of these attempts I have not met with any clear account, either as to their origin, progress or failure.
To preserve, to Zoological history, therefore, the present effort, I will premise my remarks by a brief sketch of its rise and progress.
Shortly after the close of the war with Mexico, when our territory became extended to the Pacific, the advantage of the uses of the Camel in our great interior continent suggested itself to the mind of Col. Geo.
H. Crosman, of the Army, who communicated his views to myself and others.
Examination of the subject induced the belief that the animal would be of great use, beyond our present means of transportation, (pack mules or wagons,) in carrying on trade and communication through our own deserts ; and that even if, with the progressive spirit of our country, the iron rail and steed should unite the two oceans, that there would be still to the North and to the South large regions to be developed, and that this most profitably and readily could be accomplished by the powers and endurance of the Camel.
We saw Congress voting money freely for this or that scheme for personal or local benefit, and we thought it not unjustifiable to ask for $30,000 for an experiment broadly national in its character, and of which the advantage, if successful, might be said to be incalculable.
A bill for the purpose was introduced into Congress by the Hon.
Jefferson Davis, cf Mississippi, then Chairman of the Military Committee, who entered waimlj' into the measure, and who subsequently, as Secretary of War, brought it to a successful conclusion.
From 1848 to 1855, we struggled with varying fortunes.
Our contention was not with men of science.
Had it been, no difBculties in the way of an early practical test would have been interposed.
But it was with ignorance, prejudice and ridicule.
Of the Camel, nothing was known popularly.
And its only use patent to our people, was to excite wonder and merriment in our menageries.
It is due, however, to the Military Committees of both the Senate and House to say, that they unwaveringly supported the measure throughout.
And here let me add another tribute to that just read by your Secretary, to the memory of one whose name and contributions to science are now historical.
I mean the late lamented Geo.
R. Gliddon.
He aided us much by his knowledge of the East, of the Camel itself, of its uses, with which he had been for many years practically acquainted in Egypt, and enabled us to place the matter in the right point of view before Congress and the Press.
The experiment owes to his exertions much of its success.
Without wearying you with details, sufBce it to say, through the management of General Shields, of the Senate, a bill was finally passed in favor of the experiment on the 3d of March, 1855, and soon after I was sent for by the Secretary of War, and charged by him with the responsibility of conducting it.
For my first studies, my attention had been given to Africa; but as I progressed, I found myself carried into Asia, and become satisfied that the animal would be drawn from that country with greater chances of success.
Taking up Humboldt's Isothermal Lines, and studying the effects of geological structure and topographical formation upon temperature, I carried into America a system [Decomberj of Isothermg, corresponding as nearly as I could trace them, with those of Asia, and was led to believe that in Texas, somewhere, I should meet with climates similar to many of those in Asia, in which the Camel lived ; and by the time the bill was passed, and indeed for two years before it, I was prepared with a digested plan, which I am happy to say was carried out without change, and so far fortunately.
Nearly two years' experience with the animal on this continent has given satisfactory proof that it will live, propagate and flourish among us.
In connection I would here mention, that within a few days I have heard that a fossil camel bone has been discovered in the West, and is so declared to be by one of your distinguished members, Dr. Leidy.
If this be so, I adopt the fact as evidence, further, that the Camel may be domesticated among us.
Desirous of informing myself thoroughly of the difficulties in my way, and that I might be certain of having taken them all in, I visited England and France on my route to the East, for the purpose of discussing the matter there with men of science, and of profiting by their suggestions.
In England I was cordially received, especially by Professor Owen, and D. W. ilitchell, Esq., Secretary of the Zoological Society, London, and met everywhere with encouragement.
Prof. Owen and Mr. Mitchell expressed themselves confidently as to our success.
To these two gentlemen mv warmest thanks are due for facilities, encouragement and practical suggestions.
In France, I did not mt^et with the same support.
Indeed, my visit was at an unfavorable period.
The sympathies of this country, with Russia in the struggle then going on, the vile abuse in certain of the papers of the Emperor and Empress, the fillibustering attempts on Cuba, and our own difference in relation to the Consul at San Francisco pending at the time, created in governmental circles impressions not the most favorable to Americans ; and I found so many delays interposed that the prosecution of my researches in that direction (in regard to military experience with the animal in Algeria) were discontinued.
The men of science with whom I conversed, spoke doubtingly of the result; indeed, did not think I could transport so many animals, 30 to 40, across the Atlantic, and doubted if those that might be landed would live.
With true French idiosyncrasy they examined the question only with regard to Algeria, and did not apparently extend their investigations to the hardier races of Asia.
The more I learned, the more convinced was I of the feasibility of the experiment, the only difficulty in the way being the transportation of so many animals across the sea.
But on this point I was also sanguine, the Secretary of War having, at my request, committed that portion of the experiment to Lieut.
Porter, of the Navy, an officer of ability, ingenuity and experience, and whose complete success fully demonstrated the propriety of the selection.
If my appreciation of the animal from reading only had been such as to induce me to give it so much time, and to risk so much of reputation, you may imagine my estimation of it when landed in the East ; I saw it in use, not only sustaining, but exceeding the limits of utility within which I had restricted my expectations and my declarations.
It is really a noble animal, and one of the most wonderful adaptations of the Infinite to the wants of his creatures.
Provided with water, as you all know, for several days by the peculiar formation of its stomach, and with sustenance in its ungainly hump, strongly built in front for burdens, and with a protuberant eye that ensures its footing; its fitness tor deserts andfor an irregular, broken country, deficient in water or herbage, are palpably evident.
With regard to the particular physical structure which enables it to carry a supply of water for three or four — even, in some cases, seven — days, I have not yet been satisfied.
The Camel is a ruminant, and with others of that class has distinctly its four stomachs.
The idea of a fifth, as has been adopted by some, I think we must discard.
How, then, is the water carried?
The best opinion now is, I think, that it is contained in the coatings of the first stomach, in a number of small cells, as water is held in the melon.
Such is the view of General Carbreccia, who conducted the experiment with camels in the service of the French army in Algeria.
And that the Camel, by muscular 1857.]
action, squeezes out a sufficient quantity to moisten its food at will.
Cuvier goes further, and says the Camel has the power of secreting or creating water.
How, he does not say, and we are left by his authority to our own speculations.
This is one curious point for our attention, and a satisfactory report upon it would be exceedingly interesting to science.
The hump is essentially fatty, and by some, has been thought to be intimately connected with the animal's vitality.
But I think this opinion erroneous.
I have seen nothing myself to sustain it, and Linant de Bellefonds, known in Egypt, as Linant Bey, the Chief Civil Engineer to the Viceroy, who is particularly fond of Dromedaries, told me that he had in two or three instances opened the hump and cut out portions of the fat without apparently much pain to the animal, and certainly with no material injury to it.
As I have before said, it is the animal's reservoir of food.
When forage is scant, its gradual absorption sustains life and strength, and it is not until that is totally absorbed, that the muscles and stomach, sa with other animals, are attacked.
I have seen Camels coming in from long journeys, with their backs almost straight.
In the skeleton in your Museum, there is no rise of the dorsal vertebra.
In those I have anatomized, I have invariably found a slight convexity of the upper line of the vertebra under the hump, as it were, an arch for its support.
It was with great difficulty that we could satisfy the public mind as to the hoof of the Camel.
That it was not soft and tender, but tough, and capable of travelling safely and comfortably over a fair share of stony soil.
On this point.
Dr. Atkinson and Mr. Parlane bear ample testimony.
The former, the Surgeon General of the Cabul Expedition in 1841, I think, without speaking intentionally of the Camel, introduces him in comparison with their other means of transportation ; and the Doctor speaks of its peculiar surefootedness, and that its broad, tough and yielding hoof trod securely upon the rolling cobble stones of the mountain torrents, while horses and mules slipping on them, were thrown, often to the loss of animal or load, and sometimes of both.
The latter speaks particularly to the point, and says, that in his many journeys in Asia Minor, he never saw a rounded hoof.
And when we recollect that almost all the trade of Asia, from the confines of Mongolia to the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and from India to Siberia, is carried through Central Asia, over countries mountainous, rugged and desert, through sand and volcanic debris, and that the animal travels in climates so far north as to range several degrees below zero, for instance — the Mountains of Media, at 25° below of centigrade, equal to 13° below of Fahrenheit, we may be satisfied that the Camel's foot is equal to any surface we shall have to expose it to on this continent, and corrects another popular impression, that the Camel is an animal of the Torrid Zone, and cannot stand cold.
There is one point to which I would especially call the attention of the Society.
At my first outset I was confused by the adopted nomenclature of this class of animals established by Buifon.
He calls the two-humped animal the "Camel," and the one-humped, the "Dromedary."
Now this classification excludes " the Camel" from all the world but a portion of Tartary.
Travelling in the East, however, we find the Arabic word " gimel" ^^d/'niel," Hebrew garmal, applied to both species as the generic term, and that the word dromedary is unknown.
Examining further, we find the word dromedary to be a derivative from the Greek, (Spofjcw;) runners or racers, ana to have been applied only to the riding or swift species of the one-humped class.
For my own satisfaction, and to facilitate the cbarness of my researches, 1 adopted the word Camd (Lat.
Camelus) as generic, designating the two classes of their nativity.
The two-humped I styled the Bactrian Camel, from its ancient home, Bactria, and the single-humped, the Arabian Camel, from the country of its origin in Arabia ; reserving the word dromedary as applicable only to the riding animal of the one-humped species.
Subsequently, finding these views to be entertained by Gen. 15.
Dumas, of the French Army, Director of, and long connected with, the affairs of Algeria, and by Linant Bey, of Egypt, I have openly adopted this [December, nomenclature and classification in my official Report, and would respectfully submit it to the consideration of the Academy.
The two varieties dill'er as the horse and ass ; the product of the two being a hybrid, deficient in power for the continuance of the race, and if producing at all, giving life to a poor, undersized, worthless animal.
The cross of the double-humped or Bactrian male upon the single-humped or Arabian female is known as a Tinlu or Booydec, and is the useful animal of the caravan, uniting as it does the strength of its paternity with the quicker movements of its maternal stock.
It is classed with the one-humped, though a slight rising in rear of its hump, in many instances hardly discernible, marks its double descent.
These animals will lift for short distances from 1,000 to 1,500, even 1,800 pounds, and carry on journeys from 700 to 800, making from 18 to 25 miles, according to the character of the country travelled over.
For the creation of this useful cross, double-humped males are kept throughout Asia as stallions are with us.
I did not see a cross of a single-humped male on the double-humped female, nor did I gather anything in relation to it.
Collecting my animals principally in Asia Minor, including two Bactrians, a Tinlu or hybrid, and Arabian males and females, with a few burthen camels and dromedaries from Egypt, we started for the United States from Smyrna, on the 15th of February, 1856, and landed the Camels on the shores of Texas on the 14th of May, 185G, afier an unusually rough voyage.
We sailed from Asia with 33 animals on board, and landed with 34, having lost but one of the original stock embarked, and having had some births on the way.
The success of the first importation induced a second; and on the 10th of February, 1857, fortyone more camels out of forty -three embarked were delivered in Texas, making in all 75 safely landed in America.
So far the results have realized our sanguine expectations.
But two of the whole lot, the Bactrians, have fallen victims to acclimatory disease.
The others seem to be as much at home as on their native soil, and have been used with convincing proof of their usefulness and advantage.
Our ordinary means of transportation in our great inland territory are pack mules and wagons.
A pack mule cannot carry on a journey, on an average, more than 150 pounds — I speak from experience with them in Mexico, — and requires a daily allowance of water.
The Camel carries from 350 to 800 pounds, according to quality, and is independent of water for three or four days.
The mule travels from 15 to 20 miles a day ; the Camel from 18 to 25.
The mule and the Camel consume about the same amount of food.
If anything, the Camel can do with less.
Once fed, the Camel is fed for 24 hours.
Browsing as well as grazing, it picks up food where other animals would not live, and eats readily spinous plants.
In the hyperbolic language of the East, the Camel finds sustenance where the eye of man cannot detect herbage.
On one occasion I carried, on six Camels, 3,648 pounds, over the same road and distance travelled by wagons, and gained on them 42i hours in time, the wagons carrying on an average only 1,800 pounds, and drawn by six mules each.
This comparison was altogether accidental.
Early in this year thirty-five Camels were sent with a party to the Pacific, and I am fortunate in being able to read to the Society the last report from them.
Coming, as this testimony does, from a gentleman, Mr. Beale, in no way connected with the experiment of their introduction, I think it may be regarded as impartial.
The Camels were attached to Mr. Beale's expedition, under a competent person, Mr. Heap, who had accompanied me on the first expedition, and purchased the animals for the second importation.
Mr. Beale writes : — (Extract.)
•' King's Creek, Sept. 27, 1857, 100 miles east of the Colorado.
Hon.
J.
B. Floyd, Secretary of War: Sir — I have the honor to report my arrival at this place, a creek flowing north into the Colorado.
**»**,* I cannot sufficiently express my admiration of that noble brute, the Camel ; and I look 1857.]
forward confidently to the.
day when they will be found in general use in all parts of the country.
The idea that their feet would break down in travelling over rocky ground is an exploded absurdity.
In all the explorations, over the roughest possible volcanic rock, they have been with us, patiently packing water, of which they never drank a drop, and corn, of which they never tasted a grain.
On the expedition, from which I returned yesterday, they were four days without water, and apparently without feeling the want of it.
* * * * * * * (Signed) E. F.
Beale."
On one occasion, shortly after landing the first importation, and when carrying them up from the Coast of San Antonio, the Camels broke suddenly from tlie road and rushed furiously towards one spot a little distance from it.
Fearful that something had gone amiss, I was hastening towards them with anxiety, when I was met by one of the Turks, holding out to me a plant, and with a face beaming with pleasure.
Through the American interpreter, he informed me that it was a plant of which the Camel was particularly fond, and that they had simultaneously smelt or seen it, and rushed for it.
Hence their unusual vehemence.
This, as you may suppose, came cheerfully home to me.
For if the land bore Camels' food, why not the Camels too?
The plant was apparently of the same class as purslane, but though I showed some of it to various persons in Texas, I could hear nothing of its name or quality.
I have now, gentlemen, endeavored to entertain you so far with these few desultory remarks, and hope I have succeeded in enlisting your interest.
I have already occupied too much of your time, and will therefore close by referring to the official Report of the Secretary, published by the Senate, for any further information in detail that you may require.
Major Wayne further, in reply to a question, stated that the cost of the Camels landed in America, including all expenses, averaged about $105; and that the Camel bore the sea voyage better than any animals he had seen carried at sea.
That on this point, they were all agreeably relieved.
As soon as the vessel became uneasy, the Camels would lie down of their own accord, and so remain until the gale subsided ; and that it was only necessary to secure them from chafing.
That from some experience and observation of the transportation of horses and mules during the war with Mexico, be unhesitatingly said that he would rather carry 100 Camels at sea, than ten horses or mules.
That one of the Camels presented to him by the Bey of Tunis, was on board nine months without leaving the ship, and that he continued in good health, and was now one of the finest of our Camels.
Dr. Leidy observed, in connection with the interesting remarks of Major Wayne, on the introduction of the Camel into North America, that he had been led by his palaeontological researches to believe the experiment would prove a successful one, and he had so stated his impressions in conversation with members of the Academy.
The grounds of his opinion were founded upon the following facts and inferences.
The Horse existed during the pliocene period in America, in association with the Elephant, Mastodon, Ox, Deer, Bear, Peccary, Megalonyx, Lion, Capybara, Camel, &c. This fauna most probably indicates the temperature of the American continent, as then formed, to be what it is now, or nearly so.
Though most of the genera mentioned became extinct in North America, the others abundantly exist, and the subsequent introduction of the Horse has been exceedingly fruitful in its results.
As remains of the Camel (Camdops Kansanus) have been discovered in Kansas Territory, and a congener, the Lama, still exists in South America, the reasons are favorable to the introduction of the recent Camel in this country.

Notes on the North American species of Archihnteo and Lanius, and description of a new species of Toucan, of the genuS Selenidera, Gould.
BY JOHN CASSIN.
Genus Archibuteo, Brelim.
Tsis, 1828, p. 1269.
Of this genus there are three North American species, all of which have been misunderstood and confounded with each other in a greater or less degree by authors.
Of these, the most common and best linown species, Archibuteo lar/opus, is one of the few birds of this continent which appears to be absolutely identical with the species of Europe long known by this name, the adult of which has been mistaken by American naturalists, while of the European bird the adult has apparently been unknown to British and French ornithologists, though figured and described by the Germans and others of northern Europe.

We regard the plumage first described above as undoubtedly that of the adult of this species, though it has never been given as such by any American author.
It corresponds precisely with European specimens in the Museum of this Academy, well understood by the German ornithologists to be the adult of A. lagopus, and figured as such in their works, of which some are cited above, lu both adult and young plumage there are no characters whatever, so far as we can see, by which American and European specimens can be distinguished from each other.
Our attention was first directed to the European species, and to the fact of the adult being known to the German ornithologists, by Mr. Alfred Newton, F. L. S. of Magdalene College, Cambridge, to whom we beg leave to acknowledge our indebtedness for much valuable information derived during his late visit to the United States.

In young plumage this bird considerably resembles the preceding, but is quite distinct, and generally not difficult to be distinguished.
It is larger and has the under parts much more spotted in the young, while of course the clear biack of the adult of the present bird is totally unlike any known plumage of the preceding.
In the adult of this species, the tail is of the same black as the general plumage, with one well defined band of white.
This species has not yet been observed in Western North America, though rather abundant in the Eastern and North Eastern States.

Specimens of this bird are in the fine collection made in Washington Territory by George Suckley, M. D., a highly talented young naturalist, late of the United States Army.
It appears to be a northern and Western species.

This change in perception is, however, very probably due to Mr. Macgillivray, who claims the authorship of Audubon's Synopsis (in Manual of British Ornithology, i. p. 245, London, 1840.)

In this species the entire upper parts, including rump and upper tail coverts, are uniform in color, which is bluish cinereous, darker on the head and back.
It is smaller than either of the preceding, and appears to be essentially a bird of the Southern United States.
This species is easily determined from the descriptions and figures of either Wilson or Audubon.

Quite as large as L. septentrionalis, and with same strong form of bill, but in colors more resembling L. ludovicianus.
The bill is entirely black, upper parts bluish cinereous, rather dark and quite uniform ; wings and tail black ; primaries with their basal half white, forming a very conspicuous spot on the wing ; secondaries with the basal half of their inner webs white.
Outer feathers of tail tipped with white, which color increases in extent to the outermost, which are almost entirely white.

This appears to be exclusively a Western and Northern species, the only specimens of which that we have ever seen are in the Museum of the Philadelphia Academy.
One specimen was brought from California by Dr. Gambel.
This bird is perhaps rather larger than L. sejitentrionalis, and resembles it in robustness of organization, but in colors is more like L. ludovicianus.
The white spot on the wing is much larger than in any other North American species of this group, and the inner webs of the secondaries are pure white, with more or less black at the ends of the feathers, and as though the white spot of the primaries was continued on the inner webs of the secondaries.
All the tail feathers, except the two middle, are largely tipped with white.
This bird is accurately described by Mr. Swainson as above cited.
This bird bears a greater resemblance to Vieillot's figure, referred to above, than any other species of North America.

This Toucan presents some remarkable and rather anomalous characters.
Though having the yellow auriculars and large spots of this color on the sides, and in fact the usual colors of the species of the group designated Selenidera, it has the bill longer and colored in a manner similar to Rhamphastos ambiguus.
In form the bill of this species more strongly resembles that of S. piperivora than of any other bird of this group.
There is no crescent of yellow on the back of the neck, nor are the feathers of the tail tipped with chestnut, as is usual in this group.
All the known species o?
Selenidera are in the Museum of this Academy.
This species is rather the largest of the genus.
A single specimen of this curious bird is in a very interesting collection presented to this Academy by Mr. Robert W. Mitchell, son of its distinguished member.
