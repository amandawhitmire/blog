NOTES ON THE TYPES OF SOME AMERICAN SPIDERS IN EUROPEAN COLLECTIONS.
BY NATHAN BANKS.
During a recent trip in Europe, the author had the opportunity to examine the types of a number of our spiders that are in European ■collections.
A considerable number of these, especially those described by Count Keyserling, have been figured, and of these figures are given of only a few, as in most cases we know his species, and the types of most of his Theridiidse, described from the United States, -are in the Marx collection in the U. S. National Museum.
Figures -are given of most of the other types that I was able to find, but in some cases where the species is alread}^ well known to American authors, I have not given figures.
Few synonyms result from the examination, as in most cases the unknown forms were from the western or southern part of the country.
The Koch material is dry and on pins; the colors of the Attidse are in most cases well preserved, but the structural characters of palpi and vulva can rarely be seen, unless the specimen could be relaxed.
However, most of these are readily recognized, as they come from Pennsylvania, the spiders of which are familiar to Eastern •collectors.
I have given the notes as they were made, rather than try to interpret, thus giving, others the same chance in using them.
Species of Keyserling.
Xysticus discursans Keys.
A small male; the sides of the cephalothorax evenly dark, a large ;spot behind (barely divided) a median mark, and in front brownish, with a white band through the eye-region; femur, patella, and tibia ■of legs I and II evenly dark brown, tibia III and IV more maculate.
Abdomen very dark, the three bands going across, leaving only narrow white marks.
Xysticus limbatus Keys.
Two females from Texas labelled type; one (fig.
a) has legs pale, and a lyre-shaped pale mark on the cephalothorax; the other (fig.
b), with more shrunken abdomen, is much darker, and the legs more mottled.
178 [April, Xysticus limbatus Keys.
Xysticus punctatus Keys.
PI.
XI, fig.
9.
A male in Keyserling's collection labelled X. striatus type, is, I suppose, this species, as it agrees with his description and is from Georgia; the markings in the middle are hardly as heavy as those on the sides; it may be the male of X. variabilis.
Xysticus 4-lineatus Keys.
This has been correctly identified.
Xysticus gulosus Keys.
American identifications are correct.
Xysticus emertoni Keys.
Fig.
11.
Female from Georgia; a large reddish species, the sides of cephalothorax with sinuate pale lines.
Xysticus benefactor Keys.
Fig.
18.
Resembles A^.

Xysticus hamatus Keys.
Fig.
7.
A male from Kentucky, with very distinct abdominal pattern.
Xysticus lenis Keys.
Immature female.
A lichen-gray-brown species, much mottled especially on legs; base of patella?
above with two parallel black marks; five black spots on the cephalothorax.
Xysticus stomachosus Keys.
Four females, as we have identified it.
Xysticus locuples Keys.
Fig.
10.
A large red-brown species; sides rather evenly red-brown; legs pale; the male has very long legs, very dark, the cephalothorax with four dark spots and an elongate median spot, the legs lined above with pale.
Xysticus variabilis Keys.
Fig.
6.
One female, a small species, which resembles a young stomachosus.
Synema nigromaculata Keys.
This is our *S. parvula; the apical dark mark very plain, but not distinct on the venter nor around the spinnerets.
S. parvula of Keyserling's collection has the white band on base of abdomen more distinct, and the dark band at apex goes down on venter and forms a ring around the spinnerets.
No difference in .structure as far as I can see.
Misumena spinosa Keys.
Fig.
2.
Very similar to M. asperata.
Misumena georgiana Keys.

Fig.
l. The female is immature; the male is figured.
Philodromus marxi Keys.

183 Species of Koch.
Corinna tricolor Koch.
One female, A. M. E. closer to A. S. E. than to each other, P. M. E. about three diameters apart, closer to P. S. E. A distinct species.
Corinna amoena Koch.
A female is ornata Htz.
Cephalothorax reddish, femur I blackish, hind tibia and patella banded.
Corinna cingulata Koch.
Two females are bivittata Keys.
; two bands on abdomen, hind legs lined, femur I dark on base, rest pale.
Hegalostrata venifica Karsch.
One male ; a tooth at base of fang, two large teeth on the paturon, outer one curved forward; tibial process of male palpus is about three times as long as broad, as broad at tip as at base, the tip obliquely truncate.
Xystious luctans Koch.
Not in the Berlin Museum, although there are several species from Carolina, but not labelled, as stomachosus, gulosus, and Coriarachne versicolor.
Agelena pennsylvanica Koch.
Three specimens; are our common A. ncevia, one is a good-sized, well-marked female, the two others are not mature.
Teratodes depressus Koch.
I did not find in the Berlin collection, but there is no doubt as to what it is from the figure and description.
Pachygnatha tristriata Koch.
P. xanthostoma Koch.
In the Berlin Museum are four specimens behind a label "Pennsyl.
Zimm.," but no species label, these are his tristriata according to the description, and are what Emerton has so identified.
Following this is a label ''tristriata" and " Pennsjd.
Zimm.
"; behind these labels are seven specimens of our P. hrevis.
There are no other American Pachj^gnatha in the collection.
The name labels have been put on after Koch's time, the locality labels are original.
It is therefore evident that the label "tristriata" has been misplaced, and that the seven specimens labelled "tristriata" are Koch's xanthostoma, since they agree with his description, and that P. xanthostoma is P. hrevis.
13 Epeira hispida Koch.
Two dry males.
Tibia I curved at base, slender; tibia II thickened at end and very spinose, the metatarsus curved at the base.
The body and legs with yellowish hair, tibia I dark at base -and on middle.

Gasteracantlia pallida Koch.
Not in the Berlin Museum.
Phidippus carolinus Koch.
A large species, female, densely white-haired.
Mandibles green, palpi and clypeus with very long white hair; cephalothorax mostly white-haired; legs not plainly banded, but leg T has black hair at the apex of the tibia, the rest of the fringe is white; hind tibia very plainly black at tip; venter with a narrow, black, median stripe, but elsewhere densely white.-haired ; above the abdomen is red each side behind, separated by black, and a white spot in front.
Phidippus asinarius Koch.
One female; this is plainly P. mystaceus Hentz; the white spots on cephalothorax are plain, the mandibles red-brown, venter all white-haired.
Phidippus testaceus Koch.
Two specimens, one badly rubbed and may not be the same as the other, this latter is probably P. podagrosus {multiformis).
Mandibles greenish, clypeus with yellowish hair, tips of patellae and tibiae dark; venter with pale median stripe, dark each side of this, and then the outer sides pale.
Phidippus smaragdifer Koch.
Two from New Orleans; are audax, not variegatus.
The label says '^variegatus Lucas," so all labels were probably written some time after Koch described the species.
Phidippus lunulatus Koch.

ON A COLLECTION OF BIKDS OBTAINED BY THE FRANCIS E. BOND EXPEDITION IN THE ORINOCO DELTA AND PARIA PENINSULA, VENEZUELABY WITMER STONE.
During the early part of 1911 Mr. Francis E. Bond conducted an expedition to the coast of Venezuela, mainly in the delta of the Orinoco.
He was accompanied by Messrs. Stewardson Brown, Conservator of the Botanical Section of the Academy, and Thomas S. Gillin, of Ambler, Pa.
Among the collections obtained by the expedition and generously presented by Mr.
Bond to the Academy is a series of 504 bird skins, prepared almost entirely by Mr. Gillin from specimens shot bjhimself and other members of the party.
It has been my privilege to study this collection, a complete list of which is presented herewith.
In order to better understand the relative position of the several localities, I have drawn up a brief itinerary of the expedition from notes furnished me by Mr. Brown.
Starting from Port of Spain, Trinidad, the party crossed to the peninsula of Paria, stopping at Cariaquito on the south shore.
Collecting was carried on here January 13-22, mainly close to the coast and never more than a mile or two inland.
Crossing the gulf, they stopped at Pedernales, January 25-27, and then sailed up the Vagre River, a sort of confluence of several streams, and thence up the Guanipa, arriving at the village of that name on February 2.
On February 6, they returned to the Vagre, and on the 8th went up the Manimo to the mouth of the Uracoa, which they reached on February 10.
They then ascended this stream to La Pedrita, where they remained February 12-18, and then returning to the Manimo followed it to Tucapeta, some forty miles from the Orinoco itself.
Here they spent February 22-23, and then returned down the Manimo to Pedernales, stopping at the Corisal, February 25-28, and reaching the coast on March 4.
Thence they returned to Cariaquito, where they stopped March 10-18 to make additional collections before crossing to Trinidad.
In a region so long familiar to bird collectors as the Orinoco delta it is not surprising that no new forms were obtained, but some of the records both from this district and from Cariaquito considerably extend the range of the species, and in view of the lack of definite localities in the case of early collections, the present list will, it is hoped, be of value in ascertaining the exact range of the various Venezuelan species.
It will be noticed that 101 species were obtained only at localities in the delta country, while 48 were found only at Cariaquito on the Paria peninsula, and 23 were foUnd in both regions.
These figures mean little, however, as the collection is not sufficiently comprehensive to warrant any general deductions on distribution.
A certain number of the Cariaquito species, such as Crypturus columhianus, Ceryle americana, Microrhopias grisea intermedia, Dendrocinda meruloides phceochroa, Myiozetetes similis columhianus, Chiroxiphia lanceolata, Thryophilus rufalhus castanonotis, Pachysylvia aurantiifrons saturata, Compsothylypis pitiayumi elegans, Basileuterus auricapillus olivascens, Tanagra trinitatis, Tangara desmerestii, and Icterus auricapillus, are mainly restricted to the mountainous north coast of Venezuela, extending eastward from Colombia.
There are, however, many others taken only at Cariaquito which are well known to range also over the delta region.
Notes on the color of the tarsi, irides, etc., have been taken from Mr. Gillin's labels, while a few notes on distribution and abundance received from Mr. Brown bear his initials.

NOTES ON SERPENTS IN THE FAMILY COLUBRID^.
BY JOSEPH C. THOMPSON, SURGEON, U. S. N. It is a curious fact that during the last two decades one of the rarest things in the literature dealing with serpents is a detailed account of an individual specimen.
Reference is not made to original descriptions of a type, as the majority of these are full and satisfactory, but anything like the records left by Dumeril and Bibron or by Cope of a particular specimen are now made by few authors.
The need for them is a very real one, both to students of zoogeography in their efforts to outline the distribution of allied forms, and to those engaged in the gathering of data relating to the range of variation exhibited by a given species.

Anatomy.
— Heart apex at the level of the 28th gastrostege, in terms of body vertebrae this is 20.4% down the column.
Anterior tip of the liver at the 39th gastrostege.
Habitat.
— Previously known from three specimens secured on Busuanga Island, Calamianes Group, Philippine Islands.
This species as at present defined cannot be separated from 0. vertebralis by any single isolated character.
The few specimens recorded show that the one to which Boettger's description applies may be distinguished from a tj'pical 0. vertebralis in the following details : internasal suture shorter than the prefrontal ; lateral borders of the frontal converge posteriorly, instead of being parallel; loreal broader than deep; two posterior temporals, sixth supralabial lower and not reaching to the superior-posterior temporal; the vertebral series of spots are much smaller and the transverse rows of minute dots are more distinct.
These differences are each well within the range of individual variation.
The most pronounced character is the absence of the large spots on the back of the adult 0. schadenbergi, but it does not hold for the young.
The distribution of the two broadly overlap in the Southern Philippines.
As more specimens are secured there will probably be found examples that will form a complete intermediate series.

The following were ordered to be printed : THE ANTENODAL RETICULATION OF THE WINGS OF AGKIONINE DR&GONFLIES.
BY HERBERT CAMPION.
When describing the remarkable fossil dragonfly Phenacolestes inirandus, from Florissant, Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell laid stress upon its possession of five antenodal nervures, and, upon the strength of that character alone, proposed to erect Phenacolestes — together with Dysagrion, also from the North American Tertiaries — into a new subfamily of Agrionidae, the Dysagrioninse.^ "Dysagrion Scudder, the type of the subfamily," he wrote, ''has not been supposed to possess an unusual number of antenodals, but it is evidently allied to Phenacolestes, which has five; and Scudder's figure of Dysagrion fredericii shows two antenodals beyond the arculus, and as the first two of all Agrionids must certainly have been present, there were at least four."
In the description of Phenacolestes mirandus it is stated: "Antenodal sectors five, of which only the first two continue to the radius, these being the two present in Agrioninse.
The second, however, does not meet, or nearly meet, the arculus, but ends on the radius 204/^ beyond it (a character also of Melanagrion)."
On the same occasion Prof. Cockerell described the apical half of a wing, also from the Tertiary of Florissant, as Phenacolestes parellelus, but expressed a doubt as to the true generic position of the fossil.
Subsequently, he recorded the base of a wing having six antenodal cross-nervures, which he referred provisionally to the same species.^ In the typical Agrionine wing we find two antenodals only, which cross transversely both the costal and subcostal spaces; one of them is placed before and the other at the level of the arculus.
In fact, so general is this 'number of antenodals in the Agrioninse, that for many years it was one of the chief characters used in separating that subfamily from the Calopteryginse, in which the antenodals are more numerous.
In a few recent Agrionines, however, three, or even five, antenodals occur with more or less constancy, and we are therefore no longer able to regard antenodal reticulation as a character of '■Bull.

primary importance in the classification of the Zygoptera.
Supernumerary antenodals are often weaker than the normal ones, and are frequently incomplete; that is to say, they may appear as short nervures crossing the costal space alone or the subcostal space alone.
As already remarked, the second antenodal coincides with the arculus in the typical Agrioninse, but in such genera as Agriocnemis, Argiocnemis, Ceratura, and Hemiphlebia, it comes before the level of the arculus, while it lies beyond it in the fossil genera Melanagrion and Phenacolestes.
In Neurolestes trinervis De Selys, from Kamerun, we get three complete antenodals constantly present, and, according to its describer, the supernumerarj^ nervure is placed between the usual two.
Neuragrion mysticum Karsch was described from a single 9 from Ecuador, and here again there is an additional nervure lying between the ordinary ones.
But in this case the nervure is confined to the hind-wings and to the subcostal space only.
Of Thaumatoneura, from Central America, two species are known, namely, T. inopinata McLach.
and T. pellucida Calv.
In this genus a fourth, or even a fifth, antejiodal is occasionally added to the more usual number of three, and in some instances the number is reduced to two.
The third, fourth, and fifth antenodals, when present, are placed beyond the level of the arculus and are confined to the costal space.
Podopteryx roseonotata De Selys is represented in the British Museum Collection by three specimens, namely, the type cf , obtained in Aru by A. R. Wallace, and a fine pair (cf & 9 ) from Queensland (F. P. Dodd).
The Australian examples do not possess more than two antenodals in any of their wings, but the type specimen has a third antenodal in each wing, beyond the level of the arculus, and crossing the costal space only in three wings, and both the costal and subcostal spaces in the remaining wing.
Furthermore, in three wings there is a transverse nervure traversing the subcostal space alone before the first regular antenodal.
Although the South African genus Chlorolestes does not normally possess more than two cross-veins before the nodus, there are two specimens in the British Museum Collection which exhibit a third cross-vein.
One of these insects is a cf of C. longicauda Burm., in the right hind-wing of which the additional nervure is placed between the usual two and ceases at the subcosta.
The other is a cf of C. fasciata De Selys, and in this case the added nervure, which ceases at the subcosta, lies before the first normal antenodal in the right hind-wing.
Two Neotropical genera occasionally present similar features to those observed in Chlorolestes.
The Godman-Salvin Collection of Central American Odonata, now in the British Museum, includes the type and three other specimens of Paraphlebia quinta Calv., all from Guatemala.
Two of these have an additional antenodal in as many as five out of their eight wings, and in each instance it is proximal to the first regular antenodal and is restricted to the subcostal space.
A 9 of Heteragrion chrysops Hag., from Vera Cruz, also in the Godman-Salvin Collection, has, in three of its wings, a supernumerary antenodal between the usual ones and limited to the costal space.
All the recent species which have been considered so far belong to De Selys' Legion Podagrion, a group which has been declared to be "heterogeneous and untenable," but which includes the most archaic genera of Agrioninae that have yet been made known.
However, at least two species belonging to the more highly specialized genera may be cited as affording other instances of the accidental reappearances of the kind under review.
One of these is the type 9 of Ischnura granti McLach., from Sokotra, preserved in the British Museum, in which a third antenodal is present in all the wings, except the right forewing.
In each case it is placed beyond the level of the arculus and ends on the subcosta.
The other species referred to is Pyrrhosoma nijmphula Sulz., concerning which Prof. Philip P. Calvert is kind enough to inform me that he possesses a 9 from Birmingham, Warwickshire, taken by Mr. W. H. Bath, whose left fore-wing has three antenodals, the third lying beyond the usual two and crossing the costal space only.
It is not improbable that the supernumerary antenodals which we have found to occur sporadically, as an individual peculiarity, represent nervures which were present normally in the wings of some ancestral form, but which have been lost in the majority of living Agrioninae.
The main tendency of Agrionine development has been in the direction of simplified wing-venation, and in the more highly specialized genera the costal and subcostal spaces have shared in the general elimination of superfluous cross-veins.
As soon as the number of antenodals had been reduced to two, however, specialization in this direction appears to have ceased, for no Agrionine is known having fewer than two complete cross-veins, except in rare cases of individual aberration.
In this connection it will be useful to quote some remarks made by Prof. Calvert respecting two Mexican specimens of Ischnura denticollis Burm., which are in the following terms: 223 "Two abnormalities in venation may be mentioned here: One male from Patzcuaro has only one antecubital on the right hind-wing, situated at the level of the submedian cross-vein.
One female from Orizaba has the first antecubital on the right hind-wing only about as far from the second as the costal space is wide, and it crosses only the costal, not the subcostal, space.
"^ In consequence of the discontinuous antenodal in the 9 , which I have seen, and the single antenodal in the d" lying on the level of the cubito-anal cross-vein in each case, I regard both of them as occupying the intermediate position between the two normal antenodals of Agrioninte.
If this view should prove to be well-founded, it would follow that we have evidence of the former existence of at least seven antenodals, of which the second and fourth alone persist in the greater number of recent Agrioninaj.
In a hypothetical wing, including all the antenodal cross-veins of which indications have so far been afforded by morphology and teratology, the fourth antenodal is that which coincides with the arculus, and this fact enables one to recognize it in all other Agrionine wings.
It is also comparatively easy to determine, in any given case, the identity of each of the three antenodals which precede it.
But at present I can discover no means of ascertaining the exact homology of the antenodals lying beyond the level of the arculus which occur occasionally in one or two recent genera.
In our reconstructed wing, then, we have seven antenodal crossveins, disposed in the following manner: Nos.
1, 2, and 3 placed before the level of the arculus; No.
4 coinciding more or less exactly with the arculus, and Nos.
5, 6, and 7 lying between the level of the arculus and the nodus.
Arranging in tabular form the material which we have had under review, we get this result: With antenodals Nos.

Although Phenacolestes parallelus is believed to have had six antenodal cross-veins, it has not been possible to place it in the table, as no information has been given concerning the position of the veins in relation to the arculus.
Looking at the number and arrangement of the antenodal nervures alone, and without having regard to any other considerations, it would appear that among recent genera Thaumatoneura bears the closest resemblance to Phenacolestes.
Moreover, this resemblance is accentuated when, as sometimes happens, a fourth, or even a fifth, antenodal is present.
But of course the venation of the spaces lying between the nodus and the base of the wing is only one of many characters which must be studied in attempting to arrive at the true affinities of Phenacolestes, and for the present it is perhaps advisable to retain in the subfamily Agrioninse this and other genera associated with it.
In conclusion, I have to thank Professor Calvert for his kindness in suggesting amendments to this paper, and particularly for drawing my attention to the two Mexican specimens of Ischnura denticollis recorded by him, and furnishing me with information respecting the British 9 of Pyrrhosoma nymphula contained in his own collection.

Phenacolestes Material Studied.
In 1908, Profe.ssor T. D. A. Cockerell described (1908a) two species of fossil Odonata from Station 14, Florissant, Colo., as Phenacolestes mirandus and P/!.(?)
parallelus.
A little later (19086) he added a note based on an additional fragment which he referred to the latter species, and in another place (1908c) he gave a figure showing the body as well as the wings, the previous accounts having referred to the wings only.
In connection with the original description he quotes from a letter from Professor Needham who almost implies that Ph.
mirandus is to be placed in de Selys' legion Podagrion of the Agrioninffi (1908a, p. 63).
In the latter part of 1910, Professor Cockerell wrote to me that he had found more wings of Phenacolestes, and requested me to study them, in view of some differences of opinion as to its relationship to modern dragonflies.
When I accepted this offer, Professor Cockerell sent me four specimens of these fossil wings which, for reference here, I have numbered as follows: No.
1.
Labelled " Phenacolestes mirandus Ckll.
Florissant," in Professor Cockerell's handwriting; 27 mm.
long from base to apex.
No.
2.
Labelled " Phenacolestes mirandus CkW.
Florissant Sta.
12 B (G. N. Rohwer)," in the same hand.
Apparently a hind wing.
Distorted, length from base to apex as it lies on the stone 26 mm.
Nos.
3 and 4.
Unlabelled.
[These are the two impressions of the same wing, and were collected by Geo.
N. Rohwer.
T. D. A. Cockerell.]
Apparently a front wing.
Length of No.
3 from base to apex 28 mm.
; of No.
4 (apex lost) from base to distal end of stigma 25 mm.
They are figured from enlarged photographs on Plate 'XIV as figures 1-4.
The beautiful preservation of these wings has rendered possible the drawing up of almost as full a description of the venation as for any living species.
Professor Cockerell has very kindly presented specimen No.
3 to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia ; the other three specimens will be returned to him.
Thanks to the kindness of Dr. F. A. Bather, through the good offices of Mr. C. J. Gahan, I have also studied two fossils of this insect in the British Museum of Natural History, when in London in August, 1912.
One of these, catalogued as "No.
I 8423," is the paratype of Professor Cockerell's original description of Phenacolestes mirandus.
The other, "No.
I 15,049," is labelled in Professor Cockerell's handwriting "Phenacolestes mirandus Ckll.
Florissant Sta.
13 B (S. A.
Rohwer)."
No.
I 8423 measures 20.5 mm.
in length from the wing-base to the proximal end of the stigma; the distal part of the stigma and the tip of the wing are lacking; the nodus is 9 mm.
from the base.
No.
I 15,049 has lost the stigma and apex of the wing from the distal end of M2 forward (cephalad and distad) and the extreme hind margin between the apices of M2 and Cui; its length along the costa as preserved is 23 mm., the nodus is 10 mm.
from base.
Use has also been made of an excellent photograph, for which I thank Professor Cockerell and Dr. Max M. Ellis, of the University of Colorado, of an almost perfect wing from the same locality as that of the second specimen quoted in the preceding paragraph.
This photograph is reproduced as figure 5 on Plate XIV accompanying this paper; it will be designated as No.
5 in these pages and apparently represents a front wing.
* The following account is based, therefore, on six wings in seven impressions.
Throughout this paper the Comstock-Needham nomenclature for the wing-veins has been emploj^ed.
In the previous literature on the living members of the legion Podagrion the Selysian terms have been used.
The equivalents of the two systems are therefore appended here.
De Selys: Costa = C.-N. : Costa, C. Subcosta = Subcosta, Sc.
Median vein = Ri.
Principal sector = Ml.
Ultra-nodal sector = Mia.
Nodal sector = M2.
Subnodal sector = Rs ( -f the bridge, if it be present).
1 Median sector = M3.
Short sector = M4.
First (or superior) sector of the triangle = Cui.
Second (or inferior) sector of the triangle = Cu2 and Anal (A).
Basal postcostal nervule = Cubito-anal cross-vein or c-a.
The Principal Characters of Phenacolestes (Plate XIV, figs.
1-5).
1.
Nodus at one-third of the wing-length.
2.
More than two antenodals.
(Four in at least two (Nos.
2, 3, 4) of these specimens, five in No.
5 and in the two cited from Brit.
Mus.)
3.
Postnodals 17-19.
4.
Stigma having its proximal edge oblique.
5.
Cells of the wing generally, posterior to Mi, not greatly elongated at right angles to long axis of wing.
6.
The veins generally, posterior to Mi, have but a slight caudal curvature shortly before they approach the hind margin of the wing.
7.
Between Mi and Mia is only one row of cells throughout to wingmargin.
(In No.
5, increased to two rows at five cells' distance from the margin.)
8.
Between Mio and M2 is one row of cells, increasing to two and then three rows, and so continuing to wing-margin.
1 Throughout this paper "Rs" has been used as the equivalent of de Selj^s' "*' subnodal sector. "
9.
AI2 separates from Mi at five-thirteenths ( = .38) of the distance from nodus to stigma.
(In No.
5, however, the distance is only .28, in No.
I 8423 B. M. it is .26.)
10.
Between M2 and Rs is one row of cells increasing to two and then three rows, and so continuing to the margin.
11.
Rs separates from Mi + 2 at the subnodus.
(Nos.
3, 4, 5, and B. M. I 15,049 show this clearly; B. M. I 8423 apparently agrees with them; No.
1 has the point of separation slightly proximal to the subnodus, while in No.
2 this part is indistinguishable.)
12.
Between Rs and Ms is one row" of cells, increasing to two and then to three rows of cells.
13.
Arculus slightly proximal to the second antenodal.14.
M3 separating from M1+2 at six-tenths' to three-fourths' way from arculus to subnodus.
15.
Between Ms and M4 are (a) at least two cross-veins proximal to the level of the subnodus,^ and (6) at the wing-margin are 4-5 rows of cells.
16.
Quadrilateral with («) its proximal and distal sides strongly diverging caudad and (6) its distal side more than one-and one-half times as long as its proximal side.
17.
Between Mi and Cui are (a) seven antenodal cells {sensu Selysii) and (6) at the wing-margin four to five rows of cells.
18.
Cubito-anal cross-veins one, which is situated between the levels of the first and second antenodals.
19.
Between Cui and Cu2 at the wdng-margin are about two rows of cells (three rows in B. M. No.
I 15,049).
20.
Area posterior to Cu2 without distinct branches, but with three to four rows of cells.
21.
Anal vein separating from the hind wing-margin (a) proximad to the level of the arculus and (6) proximad to the level of the cubito-anal cross-vein.
22.
Anal cross-veins, proximal to the level of the distal end of the quadrilateral, one.
Compared with Professor Cockerell's original description of Phenacolestes mirandus (1908a, p. 61), the present material shows the following differences : Antenodal cross-veins^ four in some specimens instead of five.
Basal space {i.e., cell M1-4) 4 mm.
long, instead of nearly 5 mm.
2 For B. M. No.
I 8423 I have even noted, "Arculus very slightly more distal than midway between the two normal antenodals."
» The second, or distal, of these is actually at the subnodus in the two British Museum specimens.
4 Prof. Cockerell speaks of antenodal and postnodal sectors meaning these cross-veins.
This word is not in accordance with the usage of other authors on the Odonata.
R3 in the same description should be Rs.
Quadrangle with its upper side distinctly shorter than the lower side.
Ms separating from M1+2 at 3.5-4 mm.
from the arculus, 2.5-1 mm.
from level of nodus.
Postnodal cross-veins'* 17-19, instead of 21.
Stigma bounding 3^ or 4| cells above, preservation imperfect in most of these specimens.
Ml and M2 separating at as much as 10.75 mm.
from arculus, instead of 9.67 mm.
Beyond the ciuadrangle, i.e., between M4 and Cui, are seventeen single cells (Nos.
3 and 4), or sixteen (No.
5), then two rows increasing; hence very different from Prof. Cockerell's statement, p. 62, which does not seem to agree with his figure (13 of Plate V).
There is but one row of cells between Mi and Mia throughout, thus agreeing with the description of P/i.(?)
parallehis (I.e., p. 62) in distinction from Ph.
mirandus.
Two specimens, Nos, 1 and 3, are sufficiently preserved to enable a count of the cells between M2 and Rs to be made.
From the margin proximad these are, in No.
1, 7 marginal cells, then 3 rows for 3-4 cells, then 2 rows for 6 cells, then 1 row (which is consequently met at 10-11 cells in from the margin), this single row comprising about 15 cells to the origin of Rs, three of these 15 being basad of the origin of M2.
Corresponding figures for specimen No.
3 are 5 (?)
marginal cells, then 3 rows for 4 cells, then 2 rows for 3 cells, then 1 row (which is consequently met at 8 cells in from the margin), this single row comprising about 20 cells to the origin of Rs, 5| of these 20 being basad of the origin of M2.
In B. M. No.
I 8423, this single row consists apparently of 15 cells, 4 of which are basad of the origin of M2.
In B. M. No.
I 15,049, this single row consists of 15 or 16 cells, 3 and the greater part of the fourth of which are basad of the origin of M2; No.
5 appears to be very similar.
None of these arrangements is identical with that described for Pfi.
mirandus, where, however, the single row of cells is met at 11 cells in from the margin.
Prof. Cockerell gives two formulae for Ph.
mirandus and Ph.{?)
parallelus, respectively (I.e., p. 62), these formulae being obtained by taking "a section of the wing down from the basal part of the stigma to Cu2, and count[ingl the numbers of rows of cells successively met between the longitudinal veins .... commencing with that between Ri and Mi."
The numbers of cells so obtained will depend on the exact position of the line of section, but Prof. Cockerell does not specify this.
Choosing, as the two points fixing this line, the inferior proximal angle of the stigma and the point where Cu2 meets the hind wing-margin, the following formulae for the present material were obtained: No.
1: 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2.
No.
2: (too imperfect).
No.
3: 1, 1, 2, I, 2, 2, 3, 2.
No.
4: 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2.
No.
5: 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2.
No.
I 15,049: 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2.
We have here two different formulae, neither of which agree with either of Prof. Cockerell's formulae.
Guided b}^ the amount of variation in venational details of one and the same living species of Agrioninae, I am of the opinion that the differences shown by the present material, inter se and from Prof. Cockerell's data, do not justify the specific separation of the specimens before me from Ph.
mirandus.
All of the present material show more or less distinctly the dark band across the wing, described by Prof. Cockerell; it is best illustrated in our figure 5.
Phenacolestes agrees with the venational characters of the legion Podagrion, as stated by de Selys in 1886,^ with the one exception that the wings are not "petiolees beaucoup plus loin que la nervule basale postcostale."
I think that there can be no doubt that its nearest living aUies are to be found in this group.
I have therefore made comparisons with a number of genera of this legion, especially American, with the results set forth below.
As I have had only five of the fossil wings and photographs of one other before me and am unable to determine whether all of them are of the fore or hind pairs, I have not thought it necessary to employ any great number of specimens of the living species for these comparisons.

Relationships of Thaumatoneura.
Some words maj' be added here as to the retention of Thaumatoneura in this group after the diverging opinions of Professors Needham and Foerster.
The late Mr. McLachlan, on describing Thaumatoneura (1897), referred it to the Calopteryginffi.
In 1902, I placed it in the legion Podagrion of the Agrioninse.^'' In 1903, Professor Needham associated it with the Anormostigmatini ( = legion Pseudostigma of Selys), stating that "it has all the essential venational characters of this group, and surely these are sufficiently distinctive.
"^^ A comparison of Thaumatoneura with these essential venational characters'^ gives the following result.
Thaumatoneura agrees with the Anormostigmatini in that Us separates from M1+2 at or very close to the subnodus and the part of the wing beyond the nodus is greatly enlarged.
On the other hand, Thaumatoneura differs from the Anormostigmatini in that, while the stigma is not braced, it is not diffuse or lost ; the matching of crossveins is not so marked; the longest vein between Mi and M2, which, in the preceding pages, we have assumed to be Mia, does not parallel M2 more than it parallels Mi and lies almost midway between Mi and M3; it has shorter supplementary sectors between itself and Mi and also between itself and M2; these latter tend to be longer and better developed than those anterior to Mia, and in this Thaumatoneura resembles Paraphlehia and differs from the Anormostigmatini.
This tendency to the development of more rows of cells between Mio and M2 than between Mi and Mia is emphasized in Philogenia carrillica, P. terraha, Heteragrion tricellulare, H. erythrogastrum and Argiolestes icterotnelas which have no supplementary sectors between Ml and Mia, but two between Mio and M2; all these are Podagrionines.
Even in more reduced venations of the same group, as in Allopodagrion there are no supplementary sectors between Mi and Mia, but still one between Mia and M2.
On the other hand, even in Anormostigmatini with the most reduced venation, e.g., Mecistogaster, there is a longer supplementary sector between Mi and Mia than between Mia and M2.
Professor Needham himself has pointed out some further differences of Thaumatoneura from Megaloprepus, and still others may be added.
Thus the nodus and quadrilateral (quadrangle) are no more approximated in Thaumatoneura than in many other undoubted members of the legion Podagrion (See Table I, p. 250, posted).
Thaumatoneura possesses more supplementary sectors between M2 and Rs and between Rs and Ms.
I believe, therefore, that Thaumatoneura shows more resemblances to the legion Podagrion than to the legion Pseudostigma, but it does not i« 1902, pp.

18 Needham, I.e., p. 748. seem impossible that the Anormostigmatini may have descended from some form like Thaumatoneura.
Professor Foerster considers Thaumatoneura as a connecting form between the Calopteryginse and the legion Podagrion.
''which is better left with the Calopteryginse."
"Bei .... Thamnatoneura ist der aussere Ast des Sector inferior trianguli convex nach vorn gebogen wie bei alien echten Calopterygiden.
Bei alien Agrioninen ist er dagegen schwach convex nach hint en.
"^^ Many Calopteryginse (Selys) have not Cu2 convex anteriorly, of course, such as Micromerus, Rhinocypha biforata and other species, Libellago, etc., but perhaps these are not ''echt."
On the other hand, such Agrionines as Megaloprepus, Microstigma , and Paraphlehia also have Cu2 convex anteriorly, while a tendency in the same direction is observable in Argiolestes and even in Hyponeura, so that I cannot see that any strong argument for the Calopterygine affinities of Thaumatoneura can be drawn from this character.

Comparison of Mesagrion, Heteropodagrion, and Neuragrion WITH PhENACOLESTES.
■ Of three other American genera of the legion Podagrion, Mesagrion Selys, Heteropodagrion Selys and Neuragrion Karsch, each represented b}^ a single species, the first from Bogota, the second from Quito, the third from Ecuador without more definite locality, I have seen no material.
According to the description of de Selys (1886), Mesagrion agrees with PhenacoJestes in characters above numbered 3, 7 (probably), 8, 12, and 16a, and differs from Phenacolestes in the following characters: 2.

14, and 16a, and differs from Phenacolestes in Nos.
2, 11, 156 (probably), 17a (and 6 probably), 18, and 21 in the same particulars as Mesagrion is above stated to differ from Phenacolestes.

21 Other species of Heteragrion have but two or one antenodal cell (Selys, 1886, pp.

2Dr. Karsch, in hi.s description of Neuragrion, states that it has "zwei Schaltsectoren .... zwischen dem Nodalund Ultranodalsector, " and, further on, that it agrees in this respect with Heteropodagrion, but de Selys' description of the latter is silent on this point, (although not for the same area'of Mesagrion) and, I think, implies the absence of "Schaltsectoren" here.
241 According to Karsch's clescription,^^' Nenragrion agrees with Phenacolestcs in characters above numbered 2 (but for the hind wings only), 3^ 8, 10, 12, 14 (in so far as "Der Mediansector entspringt aus dem Principalis vor der vom Nodus absteigenden Ader"), and 16a, and differs from Phenacokstes in the following characters: 2.

Prof. F. Foerster has also noted (Termesz.
Fiiz.
XXIII, p. 104, 1900) an instance of two cubito-anal cross-veins in Podopteryx.
*The type male has three antenodals on all four wings, the third being distal to the other two and not reaching posteriorly beyond the subcosta.
The two Queensland examples have only two antenodals on all the wings.
The type male has also a subcostal cross-vein, proximal to the first antenodal, on both front wings and the right hind wing; this is lacking in the Queensland specimens.
^^ Slightly distal to the second antenodal on the two wings of the right side of the Queensland male.
This is an appropriate place to record certain abnormalities of the type male, already mentioned by de Selys (1886); three of its wings have each a single medio-cubital cross-vein which, on the right front wing, is slightly proximal to the level of the normal first antenodal, but on the right hind wing and left front wing is slightly distal to the normal first antenodal.
On the left hind wing there is merely a slight rudiment or vestige of such a cross-vein projecting forward as a stump from Cu slightly distad to the level of the first antenodal.

Various Old World Genera and Phenacolestes.
The genus Wahnesia Forster, of New Guinea, has the area posterior to Cu2 fairly well developed, but not to the extent that it is in Phenacolestes, but as this genus differs from Phenacolestes in a number of characters, such as Nos.
2, 9, 11, 13, 14, 21, 22, a more detailed comparison has not been made.
^5 These three males have a brown band for the full width of the wing from the origin of M2 distad to half-way from this point to the proximal end of the stigma.
^ Occasionally increasing to two rows at the extreme margin.
<^ Each one of the three rows may divide, however, into two rows at the extreme margin.

■'^ At the extreme margin there are 5-7 rows, however; but compare p. 229, antea.

5^ One of the Natal males has on the right hind wing an additional antenodal proximal to the normal first and confined to the costal area.
None of the following Old World genera seem to offer any close approximations to Phenacolestes and therefore have not been studied further in this connection: Neurolestes Selys, Nesolestes Selys, Podolestes Selys and Synlestes Selys.
It may be notecl, however, that in Neurolestes trinervis Selys, from Old Calabar, the three antenodals are so arranged that the arculus is at the third antenodal on all four wings.
General Discussion of the Value of the Venational Characters COMPARED IN THE PRECEDING GeNERA FOR THE Determination of Relationships.
Many of the ideas which have been expressed on the changes which have taken place in the venation of Odonate wings liave been based on the comparative morphology of living representatives of the order or on considerations of mechanical advantage.
It does not follow that these foundations are trustworthy or that there has always been mechanical improvement in the wings.
Degeneration is just as probable as progressive development.
The actual course of phylogeny cannot be deduced from these considerations or from the data of morphology.
It seems therefore desirable to attempt to ascertain what paleontological evidence exists affording clues to the descent of these insects, by tracing the modifications which the wings exhibit from the Carboniferous period down to the present time.
The characters of Phenacolestes and other genera which have been compared in the preceding pages under the numbers 1 to 22 may for the most part be arranged into two groups: A.
Those characters which are concerned with the positions of the points of separation of longitudinal veins and the positions and number of certain cross-veins.
B.
Those characters which are concerned with the number of rows of cells existing between the longitudinal veins and their branches.
Group A includes numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15r/, 16, 17a, 18, 21, and 22.
1.
The Position of the Nodus.
— The Protodonata of the Carboniferous and the Permian possessed no nodus ; their subcosta (whose apex in the Odonata usually coincides with the nodus) reached often beyond mid-length of the wing, its minimal extent being to four-tenths of the wing-length in Meganeurula (Handlirsch'^'-).
The earliest of 52 Foss.
Ins., p. 309, Taf.
XXXI, figs.
37, 38. the known Odonata, from the Lias, have been segregated by Handlirsch as a suborder, distinct from the existing Zygoptera and Anisoptera, under the name Anisozygoptera.^^ These insects usually possessed a nodus which lay at about mid-length of the wing.
Handlirsch considers^'* that, of the recent forms, the Gomphidse and Calopterygidse have unquestionably the closest relations to the Anisozygoptera and are probably direct descendants thereof.
The Agrioninae of Selys have usually been looked on as descendants of Calopterygid(or -gine)-like forms."
The position of the nodus in Calopteryginae and in Agrioninae, respectively, has been stated as follows : "The position of the nodus varies in both the Calopteryginae and the Agrioninae, but in general it is farther from the base of the wing in the former than in the latter.
Among the first-named it is probably nearest the haae (one-third the wing-length) in Amphipteryx and in Chalcopteryx,^^ among the second group it is farthest from the base (more than one-third the wing-length) in Archilestes.
No Calopteryginae have the nodus as near to the base as one-fifth the winglength, but many Agrioninae have it in that position.""
This statement was based on conditions existing in recent forms.
Very little is known of fossil Zygoptera of periods earlier than the Eocene"^ when Dysagrion and fragments named Podagrion abortivum by Scudder appear.
From the Jurassic, Handlirsch lists^^ Euphceoj)sis multinervis Hagen, in fair preservation, and four possible but indeciphera]:)le species of Pseudoeuphcea, all considered to be allied to the living Epallage, Euphcea, etc., i.e., Calopteryginae of Selys.
Euphceopsis multinervis had the nodus at .44 of the wing-length.
Another fossil of the same age is Steleopteron deichmulleri placed by Handlirsch in a separate family Steleopteridae, which is considered to possess " L.c, p. 463, August, 1906.

both Epallagid (Calopterygine) and Agrionine affinities.
It had the nodus at only three-tenths of the wing-length.
*' No Cretaceous Zygoptera are listed by Handlirsch.
No ontogenetic data showing a proximal shifting in position of the nodus in any Zygopteron seem to have been published.
If the evidence that may be drawn from the hypothetical descent of Agrioninae (Selys) from Calopteryginse (Selys) be left out of consideration, there yet appears to be good paleontological support, as sketched above, for the statement of Needham^^ that shortening of the subcosta and retraction of the nodus toward the base of the wing is a developmental tendency away from the generalized condition of a long subcosta and a nodus remote from the wing-base.
Yet it must be pointed that an upper Liassic fossil is known in which the subcosta ends at only .15 of the wing-length.
This is Protomyrmeleon hrunonis Geinitz, for which Handlirsch has erected the suborder Archi-Zygoptera and which he even suggests^^ may have been a connecting link between the Protodonata and the Agrionidse ( = Agrioninae Selys) .
Should such an ancestry for the latter group ever be demonstrated, the retraction of the nodus in living Odonata could not have the same significance, as a sign of specialization, which Needham has given it.
The alternative suggestion of Handlirsch, that Protomyrmeleon is simply an analogue to the Agrionidse (Agrioninae Selys) whose descendants have become extinct, seems at present the more probable.
2.
The Number of Antenodal Cross-veins.
— A priori one might expect retraction of the nodus to be accompanied by a decrease in the number of antenodal cross-veins.
No such proportional reduction exists, however.
The two Calopterygine genera cited on p. 246 anted as having the most retracted nodus in that whole group, Chalcopteryx ^ Still another Jurassic (Eichstadt) fossil is the Agrion eichstdttense of Hagen, listed by Handlirsch as Malmagrion eichstdttense {Foss.
Ins., p. 599).

17 and Amphipteryx, have respectively 23-26 (front wing), 21-23 (hind wing), and 7-10 (front wing), 7-8 (hind wing) antenodals.
The paleontological evidence (with the exception of Protomyrmeleon, which has but one antenodal), including Steleopteron, is favorable to the view that reduction in the number of antenodals is a more recent acquisition.
The preceding paper by Mr. Campion^^ discusses in a suggestive way the apparent evidence for such reduction afforded bj' recent Agrioninae.
3.
The Number of Postnodal Cross-veins.
— Prof. Needham has concluded®^ that one of the developmental tendencies of the Odonata is: "Antenodal and postnodal crossveins becoming reduced in numljer, stronger, more regular, sometimes matched in position or differentiated among themselves."
In the Zygoptera this tendency is more evident in the antenodals than in the postnodals, the latter never becoming so few, absolutely, or relatively to the antenodals, as in certain Anisoptera, e.g., Pachydiplax (front wing: antenodals 6, postnodals 6) or Miathyria simplex (front wing: antenodals 7, postnodals 5).
In the Protodonata, owing to the great extension of the subcosta toward the apex of the wing, although there was no nodus, the potential postnodals were less numerous than the actual antenodals, assuming that the nodus of the Odonata developed at, or but little proximad to, the apex of the subcosta.
AVith retraction of the nodus a greater number of postnodals in the costal space became possible.
Numerous cases of subsequent reduction in the number doubtless occurred independently of each other, but the paleontological data are not sufficiently abundant to demonstrate progressive reduction in any one line of descent, however likely this may appear from the standpoint of mechanical advantage or of economy of vein-forming material.
4.
The Pterostigma.
— The stigma is an Odonate feature not possessed by the Protodonata.
In those Anisozygoptera, which are considered by Handlirsch®^ to be ancestral to the Calopterygidae, viz., the Tarsophlebiidse, the stigma was fairly oblique and in one species at least braced at its proximal end.^^ In EuphcBopsis, of the Jurassic, the stigma is not oblique; in ^ The Antenodal Reticulation of the Wings of Agrionine Dragonfiies.

Steleopteron, also of the same age, its proximal edge is not as oblique as in Tarsophlebia eximia and unbraced while its distal edge is more oblique.
So far as one may judge from Handhrsch's figures" of Liassic Odonata the stigma was not oblique, or but moderately so, and unbraced; the forms in which it is preserved, however, seem to have but little relationship to the insects discussed in this paper.
The paleontological evidence, therefore, furnishes little encouragement to use the stigma as a means of determining relationships.^^ It is important to notice, however, from the accompanying Table I, that the position of the stigma in the wing varies iDut little in different genera and species, so that it constitutes a relatively fixed landmark.
9,11.
The Points of Separation of M2 from Mi and of Rs from M1+2.
— Prof. Needham has noted®^ a minor line of development within the Agrioninae, "in which nodus and quadrangle become more and more approximate, and the veins M2, Rs, and Ms migrate separately along vein Ml from their accustomed places toward the stigma."
This migration may be real or apparent.
Retraction of the nodus with no change in position of the separation point of M2 would result in a greater interval between nodus and M2 and hence an apparent movement of the latter toward the stigma, but no real movement in respect to the wing as a whole.
(Compare Table I, Thaumatoneura, Rhipidolestes and Paraphlebia zoe cf .)
Real migration is where the separation-point of M2 is transferred distad considered in relation to the total wing-length, and may or may not be accompanied by a change in the position of the nodus.
(Compare Table I, Perilestes and Dysagrion, and Perilestes, Argiolestes icteromelas 9 and Melanagrion.)
These remarks will also apply to characters 11 (the separation-point of Rs, including its bridge where it exists, from M1+2), 14 (the separation-point of M3 from M1+2), 15a (the number of cross-veins proximal to the level of the subnodus between Ms and M4) and 17a (the number of antenodal cells between M 4 and Cui).
In the preceding pp.
228-244, the statements for these characters have been made with reference, not to the wing-length, but to certain more or less varying landmarks, as the arculus, nodus, or stigma; this course has been in conformity with the established custom of descriptive writers. "

"
A not developed as a vein separate from the hind margin.
The paleontological evidence with reference to the separationpoints of iVIi, Rs and AI3 is that the Liassic fossils (with the exception of Protomyrmekon) had M2 separating at the subnodus, and Rs (including its bridge) and Ms proximad to the nodus;" none of these fossils which have the nodal region preserved are considered by Handlirsch to be ancestral to Zygoptera, however.
For many of the Jurassic remains^^ the same statement as to the positions of these separation-points holds true, including Tarsophlehia eximia and EuphcEopsis multinervis; Steleopteron had Rs and Ms arising well proximad to the nodus, M2 only a short distance distad to the nodus; Palceophlebia synlestoides, which Brauer, Redtenbacher and Ganglbauer assigned to the legion Podagrion of Selys^^ but which Handlirsch regards as an Anisozygopter of doubtful position,'^^ is imperfectly preserved, but seems to have had the origins of both Rs and M2 distinctly distal to the nodus, while that of Ms was probabh' proximal to the nodus.
Paleophlebia came from the Dogger, or lower Jurassic, of Siberia, and is therefore older than the other Jurassic fossils just referred to, all of which are Malm or Upper Jura.
The paleontological evidence is consequently not altogether satisfactory and at least admits of the possibility of the separation-points of these three veins having fluctuated proximad or distad from time to time.
Prof. Needham's statement as to their migration, quoted above, has not that evidence from other sources than comparative morphology which is necessary to enable us to use these characters with perfect confidence.

The position of the arculus has been relatively stable, so that there is little reason for attaching any special phylogenetic value to it.

The Number of Cross-veins, Proximal to the Level of the Subnodus, between Ms and Mi.
— This character is closely dependent on No.
14, for the more proximal is the separation-point of Ms from Mi+2, the greater is the area available for these cross-veins.
In the genera here compared the greatest number of cross-veins, two, is found in Phenacolestes, Lithagrion, and Melanagrion, all of which have a more proximal origin of Ms.
The reverse case is not necessarily true, as Philogenia, Allopodagrion, and Dysagrion, with an equally proximal 73 Handlirsch, Foss.

16.
The Obliquity of the Quadrilateral.
— The shape of the quadrilateral becomes more oblique with the greater divergence of its proximal and distal sides.
Prof. Neeclham has assumed" that a nearly rectangular quadrilateral, in which opposite sides are parallel to each other, is the more primitive form and that from it at least two kinds of oblique quadrilaterals have arisen.
There seems to be no published ontogenetic evidence in favor of this view and the only paleontological evidence not contradicting it is limited to that puzzling Liassic form, Protomyrmeleon, in which, if Handlirsch's interpretation of the venation be correct,^^ R and M are still distinct from the base distad, and there is no trace of a beginning arculus.
On the other hand, all the Jurassic fossils, which are not clearly Anisoptera, show an oblique quadrilateral with its posterior distal angle acute.
'^* This holds true not only for those fossils referred by Handlirsch to the Zj^goptera like Euphceopsis and Steleopteron, or for forms regarded by him as ancestral to Zygoptera, as Tarsophlebia (and including a Liassic fragment, T. westwoodi^) , but also for other Anisozygoptera not apparently forefathers of the Zygoptera, as Stenophlebia, Isophlebia, and Anisophlebia .
Dysagrion of the Eocene had an oblique quadrilateral, and in fact not one of the published descriptions and figures of Tertiary Zygoptera listed byHandlirsch^^ shows a rectangular quadrilateral; all havje it oblique.
It therefore seems necessary to regard the oblique quadrilateral as the more primitive and the rectangular as a later appearance. '''

— This character is in general dependent on the degree of retraction of the nodus, as the more the nodus approaches the base of the wing the smaller is the area available for these cells.
This correlation, although not absolute and exact in the genera here compared, holds in a rough way.
We may therefore regard reduction in the number of antenodal cells as a specialization.
There appear to have been 12 on the front wing, 13 on the hind wing of Tarsophlebia eximia (counting only a single row — there are two rows in part of this area) , almost three in Steleopteron.
A reduction in the number of antenodal cells may occur independently of retraction of the nodus, however, by the greater development of the quadrilateral distad.
(Compare Table I, Thaumatoneura and Paraphlebia, also pp.
233, 237 anted.)
■ 18.
The Number of Cubito-anal Cross-veins.
— These veins are usually small and weak in the Zygoptera, and they have not been preserved well in the fossils, so that few data on their development in point of geologic time are available.
Perhaps the same kind of evidence which Mr. Campion has secured^^ fQj.
^jie reduction of the antenodals might be obtained for these cross-veins also.
It is conceivable that the ancestral Zygopteron might have had a moderate number and that some of its descendants might have acquired more, others fewer.
While recognizing the paucity of evidence, I am inclined to view reduction in their number as specialization, in harmony with the reduction of antenodals.
21.
Petiolation of the Wing.
— When the anal vein (A) separates from the hind margin of the wing at some distance from the base, a stalk-like appearance of the wing-base is produced, especially on the hind margin, to which the term "petiolee" was long ago applied by de Selys.
Petiolation involves a reduction of the anal area and is specifically mentioned by Prof. Needham^ as a fundamental developmental tendency in the Agrionidse ( = Agrionin£e Selys).
It is not visible m Protomyrmeleon (Lias); in Tarsophlebia, Stenophlebia , Isophlebia, or Anisophlebia (Jura).
It seems to have been wellmarked in Steleopteron, while the shape of the wing-outline certainly suggests it in Euphceopsis, although here A may have remained distinct from the hind margin.^* It seems justifiable to assume that the farther distad petiolation has progressed, the more specialized the insect.

The Number of Anal Cross-veins.
— Progressive petiolation reduces the area available for anal cross-veins, but not always to the extent one might expect.
Thus of American genera discussed in this paper which have the petiolation extending distad to the arculus, Paraphlehia has 2, PhUogenia 0, Dimeragrion 1 or 0, Lithagrion anal cross-veins.
Calopteryginae (Selys) have on the whole more anal cross-veins than do the Agrioninse Selys.
If the latter are descendants of some of the former and if Tarsophlehia stands in an ancestral position to the Zygoptera, then we may consider reduction in number of the anal cross-veins as a specialization.
Protomyrmeleon, Tarsophlehia, Isophlebia, and Anisophlebia each had not less than four anal cross-veins, some of them many more.
In Euphceopsis they are not preserved, in Steleopteron they appear to have been present only distad to the level of the outer (distal) end of the quadrilateral.
B.
The characters included under group B on p. 245, ajited, are Nos.
7, 8, 10, 12, 156, 176, 19, and 20.
In the comparisons made in the early pages of this paper, these characters have been stated in terms of numbers of rows of cells found between the branches of the great veins.
They may be stated also by specifying the number of interposed, or supplementary, sectors in each area, and have usually been so stated in the taxonomic literature.
It is easy to translate one method of statement into the other, as one row of cells implies no supplementary sector, two rows of cells one supplementary sector, three rows two sectors, etc.
The individual variation to which they are subject increases as the hind margin of the wing is approached.
The Protodonate wing of the Carboniferous and the Permian was richly veined with many supplementary sectors.
So also were the Odonate wdngs of the Lias, excepting Protomyrmeleon; if Handlirsch's interpretation of its venation be correct,*^ there was but one row of cells between each of the branches of the main veins, except between Rs and Ms (two rows increasing to three), Ms and M4 (two rows), M4 and Cui (two rows), and posterior to A (two rows).
Turning to the Odonata of the Jura,*" we find richly veined wings in the Anisozygoptera {Tarsophlehia, Stenophlebia, Isophlebia, Anisophlebia), and in Euphceopsis; Steleopteron has one row of cells between Mi and Mio, Mio and M2, M2 and Rs, INIs and M4, and between the veins posterior to Cui, three rows between Rs and Ms, two rows between M* and Cui.

If Handlirsch be correct in his conjecture^^ that the Protodonata have descended from such genera of the Dictyoneuridse (Palseodictyoptera) as Stenodictya, the dense venation of the former evolved from the equally dense, but more irregular, network of the latter.
The Odonata then carried reduction in the network to a greater degree than in the Protodonata and reduction in the rows of cells of the areas now under discussion would, therefore; be a specialization.
We must then recognize that as ^arly as the Lias such reduction was carried in Protomyrmeleon to a greater degree than is shown by many living genera and a similar statement must be made for Steleopteron of the Jura.
That any of these reduced venations were capable of giving rise to more exuberantly veined descendants would be denied by many phylogenists, but the actual proof of such a denial is not at hand for the Odonata.
We have, therefore, only the general tendency to guide us when we assume that reduction in density of venation in the characters of group B means specialization.
On the other hand, we must suppose that such richly veined forms of the present day as Thaumatoneura, Calopterijx, Thorc, and Neurothemis have either preserved the dense venation of, perhaps Mesozoic, ancestors or that they have acquired their density by hypertrophy in the course of generations.
*^ Here, as elsewhere in this discussion, the possibility of further light from ontogenetic studies is very evident.
Summarizing the results of this discussion, we conclude that later phylogenetic status is denoted by the following conditions in the characters of the genera compared in this paper : 1.
Retraction of the nodus toward the wing-base.

Reduction in the number of antenodals.

I have endeavored to indicate that the paleontological evidence is not as strong for some of these statements, by enclosing them in parentheses, as for those left unenclosed.
There is no ontogenetic evidence as yet.
These conclusions and the data on which they are based merely permit us to determine the probable course, or direction, of change in certain features of the venation.
They do not enable us to decide as to the relative order in which the different features changed, whether, for example in the ancestors of living Podagrionine genera, Ms assumed a position at or distad to the subnodus at an earlier, or at a later, period than the reduction of the number of rows of cells in the area posterior to Cu2 occurred, although, given a character, we can say which genera should come first and which should follow in our phylogenetic list in respect to the modifications of that character.
In the imperfection of our knowledge, we are largely guided, therefore, by motives of convenience in selecting the primary characters on which a classification of the members of this group is to be based.

81 The name Amphilestes Selys is preoccupied by Amphilestes Owen (Encyc.
Brit., 8th edit., XVII, p. 157, 1859) for a fossil mammal.

32 In spite of the fact that Philogenia terraba faUs here, instead of under RR with the rest of the genus Philogenia, the only difference which separates it is the slight one of the more distal position of the separation-point of Rs from Mi +2, and I think this does not entitle terraba to a different generic name.
9' The genus Ncitragrion Karsch was described from a single female and has been placed under rubric FF above.
If additional specimens should prove to have only two antenodals, the genus would fall under TT and would differ from Dimeragrion presumably, at least, in possessing only one cubito-anal cross-vem.

The preceding Synopsis, pp.
256-261, will enable one using this Alternative Grouping to distinguish from each other the genera listed under each final rubric.
A comparison of Synopsis and Alternative Grouping will show that, in spite of a number of differences in the order in which the genera appear in the two schemes, both begin with and both end with nearly the same forms, which may therefore be regarded as, respectively, the oldest and the youngest members, phylogenetically, of the legion Podagrion.
The Relationships of Phenacolestes.
// the conclusions reached on pp.
255-256 he correct, Dysagrion of the Eocene of Wyoming, the oldest member of the legion Podagrion now known, cannot have been an ancestor of any of the three known Miocene genera from Colorado, Phenacolestes, Lithagrion, and Melanagrion, because it lacked supplementary sectors between Mi and Cui.
Melanagrion indeed possesses one more primitive feature than is found in any of the other three of these extinct genera, viz., Rs begins proximad to the subnodus.
Phenacolestes has preserved more primitive characters than has its contemporary Lithagrion, as may be seen bja comparison of those numbered 2, (4?
), 12, 156, 17a and h, 19, 20, 21a and h, and 22, on pp.
227 and 232, anted.
Phenacolestes is more primitive than its contemporary Melanagrion in characters Nos.
1, 2, 12, 156, 17a and 6, 19, 20, 216 and 22, but less primitive in characters Nos.
3, (4?
), and 11.
See pp.
227 and 231, anted.
Phenacolestes may have been the ancestor of the New World genera Megapodagrion, Allopodagrion, and PerUestes and of the African Chlorolestes, unless it shall be shown that the less oblique pterostigma possessed by all four of these living genera cannot have been acquired from the form which existed in Phenacolestes.
Of these four, Megapodagrion is most like Phenacolestes.
But Megapodagrion and the other three genera may equally well have descended from Melanagrion, with which they agree more closely in the shape of the pterostigma, although Melanagrion is figured as having no anal cross-veins, a not very weighty objection in this connection.
Phenacolestes might be considered ancestral to Heteropodagrion and Heteragrion, were it not that these two have, in at least some species, a greater number of postnodals.
Phenacolestes was apparentlynot the ancestor of: Neuragrion, which has more postnodals, and the cubito-anal crossvein in a different position, i.e., proximal to the level of the first antenodal ; Mesagrion, for the second reason just given for Neuragrion; Thaumatoneura, Paraphlehia, or Dimeragrion, which have more than one cubito-anal cross-vein and denser venation in the wing generally {Thaumatoneura), or between Cui and Cu2 {Paraphlehia), or as shown in the greater numbers of postnodals (all three) ; Philogenia, which has more postnodals and rather denser venation between Mia and M2; Rhipidolestes, which has Ms separating from M1+2 more proximad, Rs beginning proximad to subnodus, and more postnodals; Podopterijx, which has a denser venation between Ma and M4 and posterior to Cu2, and more postnodals; Argiolestes, which has a denser venation between Ms and M4.
Comparisons with genera of the Old World having more reduced venations are useless, as the equally possible descent from other extinct genera than Phenacolestes arises again.
Whether Megapodagrion and its near ally Allopodagrion are to be looked on as descendants of Phenacolestes or of Melanagrion, 18 it is of interest to point out that they are not in their present geographical distribution the nearest Podagrionine genera to Colorado, as none of their species are known from a more northern locality than Colombia ("Bogota")In the intervening territory are found Thaumatoneura, Paraphlehia, Philogenia, Heteragrion, and Perilestes, and of these four genera the most northern known representatives are Paraphlebia zoe and hyalina and Heteragrion chrysops of the State of Vera Cruz, Mexico.^* Professor Cockerell has suggested in correspondence that although the genera allied to Phenacolestes are now Neotropical, they are of northern origin or had northern ancestors.
Considering how widespread are the living genera of the legion Podagrion, it seems inconceivable that their forerunners in the Miocene did not inhabit many other regions than Colorado, The fact that we know them only from Florissant seems to the writer very negative and insufficient evidence on which to found a conjecture as to the place of origin of this group.
On THE Subfamily Dysagrionin^ Cockerell.
Preceding his original description of Phenacolestes mirandus, Professor Cockerell proposes a new subfamily of Agrionidse {sensu strictiori) , under the name Dysagrioninse, which he defines as follows.^' "Antenodals 2 Subfamily Agrioninae.
Antenodals 4 or more Subfamily Dysagrioninse."
The number of antenodals is hardly a character of sufficient importance by itself to establish a subfamily, owing to its variability, and at least three genera come between Professor Cockerell's two divisions.
Thus in Thaumatoneura M'Lachn., the number of antenodals varies from 3 to 5, and Neurolestes Selys of Africa and Neuragrion Karsch of Ecuador have three antenodals.^*'" It is not without bearing on the present topic that all three of these living genera, as well as Phenacolestes, are of Selys' legion Podagrion, but if any new taxonomic arrangement, whether of "subfamilies" or of "legions," is to be made, the distinctive characters must be formulated in some other terms than those which Professor Cockerell has employed.
The tenability of the subfamily Dysagrioninse has also been discussed 98 Calvert, Biol.

"^"^ Additional Data on Dimeragrion n. gen.
In addition to the venational characters which have been given on pp.
238-239, anted, the following are generic features from other parts of the body: Second antennal joint one and one-half times as long as the first, the third longer than the first two together.
Ligula (median labial lobe) bilobed in its distal third, apices tapering but not very acute, separated by an interval whose width is about equal to its depth.
Tibial spines longer (often 2-3 times longer) than the intervals separating them, 7-8 in the anterior (outer) row, and 8-9 in the posterior (inner) row of the third tibia.
The generic name proposed is in allusion to the fact that there are two supplementary sectors onl}^ in two areas of the "vv^ng, viz., those between Mio and M2 and between Rs and Ms.

Distal half of the labrum and the mandibles dark metallic violet.
Submentum, mentum, and bases of the maxillse luteous, the distal parts of these two pairs of appendages blackish.
Antennae black.
Prothorax black with a slight metallic green reflection.
Mesepisterna and mesepimera metallic green, low^er part (more than half) of the former and the third fourth (counting from above) of the latter pruinose, or the latter without pruinosity.
Metepisternum metallic green or metallic violet, a narrow pale (luteous ?)
stripe separating this color from that of the mesepimeron, or this pale stripe absent (still older males).
Metepimeron and metasternum pale brown or luteous, some pruinosity on the latter.
"1 These Proceedings, anted, pp.
220-224.
Legs blackish, some pruinosity on coxse, trochanters, and femora.
Wings uncolored, the venation described on p. 238.
Stigma dark brown, surmounting 2+ to 4 cells, its proximal side very oblique, so that one or more postnodals are placed between it and the costa, and at least twice as long as the distal side.
The relative lengths of the four sides of the stigma, beginning with the longest, are : posterior, proximal, anterior, distal.
No brace-vein, i.e., no thickened crossvein in prolongation caudad of the proximal side.
Dorsum of abdominal segments 1 and 2 dark metallic green, of 3-10 black, except that in the middle of 3-5 or 6 the black is replaced by ill-defined dark brown.
Sides of 1 and 2, a transverse basal ring on 3, sides inferiorly of 3-7, pale brown or luteous.
The dorsal black of 3-6 is continued ventrad at the posterior ends of these segments, forming a transverse apical band on each.
A transverse basal yellow ring on 4-7.
Intersegmental articulations of 7-10 luteous, otherwise 8-10 are wholly black, 9 being also pruinose on the dorsum.
Pruinose traces are also visible on the intersegmental articulation of 1-2 and on the sides and sternites of most of the segments.
Hind margin of 10 entire.
Superior appendages longer than 10, a little shorter than 9, black, partly pruinose.
Viewed in profile, the axis of each appendage is parallel to that of the abdomen, but the superior margin is strongly declined in the proximal fourth, less so in the remaining three-fourths ; the inferior margin in the distal three-fourths of the appendage is produced ventrad into a strongly convex lamella which terminates at the blunt apex of the appendage ; this lamella reaches its maximum at one-half to two-thirds of the appendage-length.
On the dorsal surface of the appendage at the extreme base is a short transverse ridge, which in profile view appears as a tooth.
In dorsal view, each superior appendage shows its superior margin as almost straight and decreasing in width throughout the proximal three-fourths, while the distal fourth is strongly curved toward its fellow of the opposite side; the ventral lamella is inclined inward and downward (mesad and ventrad) , the short transverse basal ridge is at the mesal margin.
Inferior appendages about seven-eighths as long as the superiors, black.
Each one, in profile view, conical, tapering more rapidly on the superior margin beyond two-fifths its length, so that at this point this margin shows an angle; distal third curved strongly upward (dorsad) and terminating in a slender very acute apex.
In ventral view, each appendage is applied against its fellow for the proximal three-fifths of its length, beyond which it is continued along the outer (ectal) edge as a blunt cylindrical process one-half to one-third as wide as the proximal part of the appendage; the abrupt contraction from the proximal part to the distal process is made by a right-angled "shoulder."
I have not been able to detect any differences either in these appendages or in the genitalia of the second abdominal segment of the males from the four different localities.
Young d^ .
— Differs from the adult cf in the absence of pruinosity, in the paler hue of the yellow areas generally, in having pale yellow where the adult has luteous; metallic violet on the head paler, bases of the mandibles and a spot between each one and the adjacent eye yellow, metallic violet or metallic brown instead of metallic green on the thorax, an indistinct narrow yellowish stripe on each side of the mid-dorsal thoracic carina, a bright yellow line on the humeral suture, coxse and trochanters pale yellow, pterostigma paler brown with a pale luteous line just within each bounding vein, dorsum of abdominal segments 1 and 2 metallic blue, of 3-7 dark brown, darker at the hind end of each where it is continued ventrad as in the adult, most of the ventral surfaces of 7-10 pale j-ellow, except at the hind ends of 7 and 8 which are blackish, proximal half of the inferior appendages yellowish ventrally.
9 .
Differs from the adult cf as follows : Dark color on the nasus, rhinarium and labrum shining black instead of metallic violet.
Sides of the first two (confluent with the transverse yellow band below), bases of the mandibles and an oblique band running from each eye upward (dorsad) and inward (mesad) on to the anterior surface of the frons to a variable distance (not correlated with amount of pruinosity on body), bright yellow.
A narrow stripe on the humeral suture, a wider stripe on the first lateral suture and on the metepisternum bordering the second suture, yellowish.
Pruinosity on the thorax in slight quantity on the sterna and metapleuron, or on the sterna only.
Coxae and trochanters yellow.
Pterostigma as described for the young male, pruinose on the under surface.
No pruinosity (or but a trace of it) on the dorsal side of abdominal segment 9, but present in slight traces on the sides inferiorly of 1-8 and in somewhat greater amount on the sternites of 1-8.
Hind margin of 10 with a narrow mid-dorsal notch about one-fourth as deep as the length of the segment, from which runs a low median carina to the anterior end of the segment; ventral surface of this segment pale brown.
Abdominal appendages about twice as long as segment 10, not as long as segment 9, straight, slender, tapering to an acute apex, black.
Genital valves ( = external gonapophyses of 9) reaching almost, but not quite, to the level of the hind end of 10, brownish, ventral margin spinulose, the palps slender, reaching beyond the level of the hind end of 10, but not of that of the anal tubercle ( = 11), darker in color.
Of the two females from Tumatumari, one lacks all pruinosity on the body and the pterostigmata, the other has a small quantity on the rear of the head only; they appear to be the most immature of their sex in the present material.
Dimensions.
— Abdomen cf 26,5-34, 9 24,5-25,5; hind wing cf 21,5-25, 9 20-22.5 mm.
Habitat.
— British Guiana: Wismar, January 30 and 31, three males, three females; Rockstone, February 1, six males, one female; Tumatumari, February 5, one male, February 7, one female, February 11, one male, one female; Potoro Landing, February 10, three males.
Collectors, L. A, and E, B, Williamson and B. J. Rainey, 1912.
Type.
— A male from Wismar, January 30, abdomen 30.5, hind wing 22,5 mm, long, in the collection of Mr, E. B, Williamson, of Bluffton, Ind, The other material in the cohections of Mr. WiUiamson and of the author.
Habits.
— The Tumatumari female of February 11, the youngest of her sex of the present material bears this label by Mr. E, B, Williamson: "taken at top of trail 2| mile past Tiger Creek trail on twig."
A male from Potoro Landing, the smallest of his sex in all the present lot has this note by the same collector: "On ends of twigs wings expanded usually in shade," Mr, Williamson has kindly furnished the following notes with reference to the habits: "At Wismar back from the river, across the railroad tracks and south of the eminence on which stands the manager's (Mr. Croombie's) house, is a brushy swampy woods, traversed by numerous small streams which head in small ravines with abrupt and rocky ends or pockets.
These streams at the season I was there were small and frequently disappeared and hence were followed with some difficult}^ in their upper course.
All were short and were intermingled in the lower (east) end of the woods where the ground was swampy and the footing treacherous.
The Agrionines were found usually near the upper ends of the streams below the rocky pockets.
"At Rockstone the railroad track was followed back toward Wismar where two or three streams, small at this season, cross the track at intervals, flowing in a northerly direction.
These streams were 1913.
269 followed in the direction of their flow till each was lost in the woods and it was impossible to trace its course further.
"The habits of the Agrionines at both locations (Wismar and Rockstone) were identical.
They rested on the extreme tips of dead twigs, usually two or three feet from the ground, with outspread wings and rigidly horizontal bodies.
The color and the position assumed gave the impression of alertness and self-reliance.
The flight was swift, and because of light-conditions also, was difficult to follow.
At rest they were fairly conspicuous.
When one flew at my approach I stood still and began examining the possible destinations in the direction of its flight, and thus located it."
Variations.
— The smallest males are from Potoro Landing, followed in order by those from Tumatumari, Wismar and Rockstone.
The order of the females by size from the smallest is not the same, owing perhaps to there being but a single specimen of this sex from Rockstone, viz.
: Tumatumari, Rockstone, Wismar, The most remarkable variation in this species is in the number of cubito-anal cross-veins, which varies from 1 to 4 on the front wings and from 1 to 5 on the hind.
Of the twenty specimens studied only three (all males) have the same number on all four wings, and of these three two have 2 cubito-anal cross-veins and the third three.
Two other specimens (females) agree with each other in the number and arrangement of these veins on their four wings, leaving fifteen out of the twenty no two of which are exactly alike in this feature when all four wings are considered.
The remarkable nature of this variation will be appreciated when it is recalled that in the great majority of the Agrioninse of de Selys there is but a single cubito-anal crossvein on each wing.
The conditions found in the present material are summarized in the following Table II.
Showing the Number of Wings of Twenty Individuals of Dimeragrion peraihitale having the Specified Numbers of Cubito-anal Cross-veins.
(The numbers in parentheses are those of the wings in which the most proximal of these cross-veins is situated proximad to the level of the first antenodal.)

The specific name proposed, percuhitale, is in allusion to the unusual numbers of cubito-anal cross-veins.

A CONTRIBUTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORTHOPTERA OF ARGENTINA.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN, The present paper is based entirely on collections made by Mr. P. Jorgensen, of Buenos Aires.
These collections were sent either direct to us for study or through Mr. Esben Petersen, of Silkeborg, Denmark, to whose interest we are obligated for much of the material treated in the paper.
In addition to thanking these gentlemen for the opportunity to study the present collections, we also wish, on behalf of the Academy, to thank Mr. Jorgensen for the very important additions received from the collection, by far the greater portion of which, including all the types and unique specimens, remain in the Academy series.
The entire series, collected over the greater portion of northern and north-central Argentina, comprises ten hundred and twenty specimens, representing one hundred and sixty -two species, of which three genera and twenty species are new to science.
The general regions represented in the collections are: First.
Territory of the Misiones.
The extreme northeastern extension of Argentina extending between the Parana and Uruguay Rivers, which respectively separate it from Paraguay and Brazil.
In consequence of its f>osition it has a far greater proportion of tropical types than any other portion or portions of Argentina.
Second.
Province of Corrientes.
Southwest of the Misiones and between the same rivers, but of a less tropical character.
Third.
Province of Jujuy.
The extreme northwestern province, forming part of the Bolivian boundary.
This is a region characterized by a number of types of Orthoptera peculiar to it or shared with Bolivia or the province of Salta to the south and east.
Fourth.
Province of Salta.
This province is next south of Jujuy, which it also bounds on the east, the latter portion forming part of the Chaco region.
Fifth.
Province of Tucuman, South of Salta and at the east base of the Andean uplift, part of which is within the province.
Sixth.
Provinces of San Juan and Mendoza.
These are in the •west-central part of the country, forming a considerable part of the Chilean frontier and including conditions from the plains to the summits of the Andes.
Mr. Jorgensen has kindly furnished us with the following information on these two provinces, which he has examined with considerable care.
"Provincia de Mendoza is unusually dry and exceedingly hot (extreme heat 42° C).
Rain falls as a rule in local showers, although occasionally there are heavy rainfalls with terrific thunderstorms.
As a rule, the sky is cloudless,, and the temperature, even in summer, often falls to a considerable degree at night.
In the district around the town of Mendoza it freezes not rarely at night during the 'winter' months (May-September), although even at this elevation to see a layer of snow in the morning is rare, and in any event, even in the coldest months, snow never has the opportunity of laying, for it can be quite hot towards midday.
Only high up and in the front range of the Cordillera de Mendoza the snow lays for long periods in the very coldest months.
In the lowlands, or rather the flat lower lying districts, east of the Cordilleras, the ground is composed of alluvial strata of an ash-gray, finely powdered clay soil, which bears a rich bush vegetation, the gray color of which, together with its adaptation to the climate, points to an ancient desert vegetation.
A large proportion of the plants,, quite apart from the cacti, are thorny and spiky, the Spanish name 'Espinales' thus suiting the district admirably.
The grass fruits are often prickly and also in a single instance mechanical flycatchers..
Many of the plants here are very aromatic or contain quantities of resin.
At the transition point between the lowlands and the Cordilleras, the ground is more or less rising, here and there swamps are to be found, often strongly impregnated with saltpeter, and nearly everywhere are to be found stones (rolling stones), or even pieces of rock, mixed with the earth.
The front ranges of the Cordilleras,, which rise to the west of the city of Mendoza, are partly solid rock and partly products of disintegration.
These are covered with thevery same plants as the lowland (Covillea divaricata, Gourhcea decorticans, Prosopis campestris and alpataco, Acacia furcata, Senecia mendocinus, Suoeda divaricata, etc.).
Localities: Mendoza (767 meters above the sea), Chacras de Coria (936 meters), nine kilometers more southerly, both at the foot of the first range, Precordillera de Mendoza; Punta del Agua and Blanco Encalada (1,068 meters) in the mountains and railroad stations on the Ferro Carril Transandina ;, Potrerillos (1,368 meters) and San Ignacio (1,325 meters), railroad stations in a large valley in the second range, Cerro Negro, on the Rio Mendoza; Pedregal (696 meters), seventeen kilometers east of Mendoza, swamps; La Paz (504 meters), forty-eight kilometers .southeast of Mendoza on the Rio Tunuyan.
The Provincia de San Juan is similar to Mendoza, but hotter and drier."
Seventh.
Province of San Luis.
East of Mendoza and, according to Mr. Jorgensen, of the same nature and condition as around Mendoza.
Eighth.
Province of Cordoba.
East of San Luis and forming a considerable part of the great ''Pampa. "
Ninth.
Vicinit}^ of Buenos Aires, The immediate vicinity of the t3apital, a historic zoological locality, is represented by quite a number of specimens.
The total number of species represented aside from the new forms is one hundred and forty-two, of which fifty-six are here recorded from Argentina for the first time.
Of these fifty-six, forty-nine are recorded only from the Misiones.
Of the total of one hundred and sixty-two species, one hundred and sixteen are recorded from the Misicrnes.
These figures give some idea of the richness of the Misiones territory in Orthoptera.
A tabulation of the distribution of the entire list of species shows, among other things, the following interesting features: One hundred and sixteen species recorded from the Misiones.
Twenty species recorded from the Misiones and west of, but not south of, the same.
Forty-seven species recorded from Brazil, Paraguay and the Misiones alone in Argentina.
Thirty-two species recorded from the Misiones and the Pampan region, also northward, but not westward.
Seventeen species recorded from Buenos Aires westward to Mendoza.
(Typical pampan and plains forms.)
One species recorded only from Jujuy and the Pampas.
Three species recorded only from the Chaco, Jujuy, and Tucuman.
The distribution of all of the species treated has been given in the paper, and, aside from the new ones, the forms here recorded from Argentina for the first time bear an asterisk before their names.

This new form is a very interesting species apparently allied to E. testacea Brunner, from Brazil, and caizana Giglio-Tos, from Bolivia, differing from the former in the color pattern of the head and pronotum and in the covered portion of the tegmen being no darker than the general color, and from caizana in the greater size, in the more rotundate median protuberance of the caudal margin of the pronotum, the non-punctate margins of the same, in the blackish humeral trunk of the tegmina and the non-punctate limbs.
Size medium.
Head very slightly projecting beyond the pronotum, considerably depressed; interocular space nearly one and one-half times the depth of the eye, the outline hardly rounded when seen from the dorsum, the eyes well rounded; paired ocelli enormous in size, elliptical in outline, converging ventrad, slightly impressed; antennae slightly longer than half of the body length.
Pronotum of the form, found in most species of the genus, cephalic margin regularly arcuate from the lateral angles except for a slight flattening dorsad of the head, lateral angles very narrowly rounded obtuseangulate, lateral margins moderately convergent caudad, caudal margin appreciably produced mesad into a broad rounded expansion, laterad of which the margins are arcuato-emarginate ; disk with two pairs of impressed punctures slightly cephalad of the middle, the usual transverse creasing of the surface toward the caudal margin distinct but not deep.
Tegmina surpassing the apex of the abdomen by about half the pronotal length, moderately broad, the median half subequal in width ; costal margin moderately arcuate in the proximal 2 2-<; //o-^-^opo?, bearing brandmarks .
19 half, then straight and finally narrowly rounding to the apex, sutural margin subrect in the proximal two-thirds, thence arcuate oblique-truncate to the wellrounded but in general form acute apex; venation prominent; anal field very elongate pyriform, the anal vein reaching the sutural margin mesad.

Abdomen strongly depressed; supra-anal plate broad, produced, rounded, with a median rectangulate emargination ; cerci subfusiform, the distal extremity attenuate; subgenital plate broad, rounded, .slightly asymmetrical, slightly impressed at the insertion of the styles, the latter very small.
Cephalic femora with the ventro-cephalic margin armed with four or five spines mesad and a single distal one, the area between supplied with very short setiform spinulations.
Median and caudal limbs with the ventro-cephalic margins of the femora supplied with five spaced spines.
Caudal metatarsi very slightly longer than the remainder of the tarsus, biseriato-spinulose ventrad, pulvillus small, distad.
General color cream-buff, the tegmina, aside from the costal portion, nearly uncolored translucent, maculations Vandyke brown and where less decided russet.
Head with the occiput having a large maculation of vandyke brown divided cephalo-caudad by a line of the base color ; region from the middle of the interocular space to the middle of the interocellar space russet with a decided vandyke brown section dorsad; eyes seal brown; antennae, except for the pale proximal joint, bistre.
Pronotum thickly speckled with fine vandyke brown points with less frequent rather regularly placed larger dots ' of the same color, a median sublyrate pattern, part of which is made up of a transverse series of eight large dots, of the same color; caudal margin with a series of well-spaced points.
Tegmina with a short sinuous line on the base of the humeral trunk seal brown, the wellscattered points, which sometimes resolve themselves into larger blotches, russet.
Wings hyaline with the veins of the anterior field very pale russet and of the posterior field Vandyke brown, the coriaceous portion of the costal margin buffy.

The size shows almost no variation, while color differences are wholly in the degree of density of the fine brownish punctations on the tegmina.
In this respect the type represents one pale extreme, from which the series grades to the other extreme, represented by one specimen, in which these small spots are much more abundant and generally distril:)uted on the tegmina, being well marked on the costal field.
The larger maculations of the tegmina of the type are represented in the darker individuals by smaller, Vandyke brown, more sharply cut ones, while the lining of the humeral trunk is broader, solid, and decidedly striking.

This specimen is very interesting as, while it fully agrees with the descriptions of the female of this species in every other respect, according exactly in the form of the tegminal margins, it differs in the tegmina being distinctly longer than in the more usual type described.
The tegmina in our specimen cover nearly half of the abdomen and are nineteen millimeters in length from the point of attachment to the extreme portion of the margin.
The previous descriptions give the length of the tegmina as from ten to twelve millimeters.
All of the older records of the species are simply from ''Brazil."
The present author has recorded a male from Yaguarasapa, Paraguay, while Giglio-Tos^ has recorded what is in all probability this or a congeneric species from Paraguay as Blabera fumigata, a peculiarly Cuban species, the female of which resembles this genus.

The Genus COPTOPTEEYX.
In studying the material in the present collection belonging to the genus Coptopteryx, we have found it necessary to make a preliminary revision of the genus, examining all the available material belonging to the same.
From the present series, the Academy Collection and the Hebard Collection we have assembled fifty specimens, and from a careful study of this series it is evident that considerable confusion has existed in all previous work on the genus, including that by the present author.
A large portion of this confusion is directly traceable to Saussure's error in using Blanchard's name crenaticoUis for a species distinct from that author's gayi, when, as shown by the present material, they are clearly sexes of the same species.
It is evident from our material that almost all of the species'* of the genus show very considerable size variation, that venational characters are very unreliable, and also that green phases with hyaline tegmina and wings in the male, and brown phases with infumate or infuscate tegmina and wings in the same sex probabl}^ will be found in the same species, although we have little conclusive evidence regarding the color phases.
The following key has been constructed from the material before us and we trust it will be found serviceable.

The two males from Sapucay previously recorded by us as crenaticollis (vide infra) are considerably smaller than any other specimens of that sex, although the largest male individual is from the same locality.
The females of the Sapucay series show very similar, but somewhat less decided size variation, while those from the Province of Mendoza average considerably smaller, yet show much variation among themselves.

The Cordillera de Mendoza specimen differs from all the other specimens seen in having the margins of the collar of the pronotum more decidedly converging cephalad, the cephalic extremity being much narrower than usual in consequence.
This appears, however, to be purely individual.
The species, from the basis of previous records and present material, is known to range from southern Brazil (Saussure) and central Paraguay (Sapucay) south to Uruguay (Saussure) and west to the Cordillera de Mendoza, Argentina.

The present material fully agrees with Fabricius' original description, which, though brief, satisfactorily characterizes the species.
The second description given by Saussure^^ shows some points of difference from our material, and it is quite probable that he had another (Brazilian) species before him.
Our specimens have no trace of a covering or overcapping projection of the front extending over the inferior ocellus, as described by Saussure, in fact there is no approach to a development of this sort of structure, which is so marked in Pseudomiopteryx and toward which Saussure considered rustica, as understood by him, to tend.
The cephalic coxae are very finely serrulate instead of unarmed as stated to be by Saussure.
One of our specimens is more decidedly infuscate than the others, being as dark as specimens of Pseudomiopteryx infuscafa, but this is apparently individual.

Redtenbacher considered marginale a close ally to the congeneric fasciatum, from which it was separated by the lineate femora.
Gray's Phasma hopii was unknown to him and accordingly placed doubtfully under the genus Stratocles.
The original description of fasciatum gives us no clue to the color of the femora.
The presence or absence of the lateral thoracic line of yellowish, the slightly annulate antennae and the differences in the tegminal protuberance used by us to separate the Sapucay material into hopii and fasciatus have been shown by Redtenbacher to be individual in character.
The localities given in the original description, with Sapucay, Paraguay, are all that were previously known.

Two adult females, one immature male, one immature female.
The immature male shows conclusively that this genus is not the opposite (female) sex of Paraleptynia Caudell, which was suggested as a possibility in the original description of Steleoxiphus.
The character of the antennae, form of the head and proportions show the two to be generically distinct, and in these respects the two sexes are very similar.
The immature male and female, both taken on December 14th, are similar in size, being somewhat more than half the length of the adults.
The anal segment of the male is compressed, carinate dorsad, more strongly so distad, the distal margin obtuse-angulate emarginate; supra-anal plate very minute, trigonal; cerci more than half the length of the anal segment, crassate, subcylindrical, apex subacute; subgenital plate hardly reaching the apex of the anal segment, apex narrowly rotundato-subtuberculate.
The immature female has the subgenital operculum but slightly shorter proportionately than it is in the adult.
XIPHOPHASMA" n. gen. A member of the Clitumninae and related to Steleoxiphus Rehn and Paraleptynia and Ceratiscus Caudell.
From Steleoxiphus it can readily be separated by the bispinose and broader head, the more abbreviate metatarsi and the depressed and abbreviate antennae; " From i-Kpog, sword, and Phasma.
from Paraleptijnia and Ceratiscus the new genus differs in the spinose head, also from the former in the more abbreviate antennse and from the latter in the narrower head, more abbreviate metatarsi and non-lobate limbs.
Head bispinose ; greatest width of the head less than the length of the same; antennae short, composed of fifteen joints, the proximal longer than broad, the next subquadrate, the third subequal to the first in length, the fourth transverse, the remainder longitudinal and tapering, the fifth and sixth less longitudinal than the succeeding ones, all depressed.
Median segment longitudinal, subequal to the head in length.
Cerci of female terete; subgenital plate of female greatly elongate, lanceolate, compressed.
Limbs non-lobate; tarsi abbreviate, in no case a fourth the tibial length ; metatarsi of the cephalic limbs slightly more than half the length of the tarsi, of the other 'limbs a half or less than a half the length of the same.

Belonging to the section of the genus including chichimeca Saussure, tecta Morse, annulipes Bruner and scudderi Bolivar.
From chichimeca and scudderi the present form can be readily distinguished by the tectate dorsum, scudderi also having the femora narrower; from annulipes the new form can be separated by the non-glabrous surface and the blunter and much less produced vertex, no approach being found to the type of T. prorsa, the vertex of which that of annulipes is said to greatly resemble.
From tecta, its closest ally, paratecta can be separated by the more elevated and arcuate median carina of the pronotum, the more regularly angulate cephalic margin of the same, the less decidedly lineato-rugulose dorsum of the pronotum, the less projecting vertex, the less thickened margins of the frontal costa,.
the more lanceolate tegmina and more finely sculptured pagina of the caudal femora.
Size medium (for the genus); form robust; surface rather evenly chagrinous.
Head with the greatest width contained about one and one-third times in the depth of the same; fastigium with the carina regularly arcuate when seen from above, obsolete immediately laterad of the median carina, width of the fastigium subequal to that of one of the eyes; median carina of the fastigium prominent, projecting moderately cephalad of the lateral carina of the fastigium, when viewed from the side strongly arcuate and passing into the 1913.
305 facial outline, which is arcuate with a slight sinuosity at the ocellus; facial forks moderately separated, hardly diverging ventrad; eyes considerably shorter than the depth of the infra-ocular portion of the genffi, trigono-reniform in basal outline, moderately prominent when seen from the dorsum.
Pronotum tectate in section, the median carina well elevated, in longitudinal section regularly arcuate with the very faintest interhumeral flattening; cephalic margin of the pronotum almost rectangulate, the immediate angle very fine, reaching to the base of the fastigial carina of the vertex; humeral angles not at all prominent, rounded very broad obtuse-angulate ; apex reaching Pig 10,— Tettigidea parateda n. sp.

General color seal brown with the dorsum largely fawn color and the venter pale ochraceous.
The pale dorsal color is clouded with the general color except for a clear section cephalad on the pronotum and a reversed V-shaped section which has its apex on the median carina between the shoulders, extending laterad over the dorsum of the pronotum and the dorsal and lateral faces of the caudal femora; median carina of the pronotum beaded with about seven regularly placed areas of the dark general color.

Three adult males, ten adult females, one immature female.
These specimens average slightly larger than individuals from Cordoba and Carcarana, Argentina, but smaller than Sapucay, Paraguay, representatives.
The number of spines on the dorso-lateral margin of the caudal tibise is very unreliable as a diagnostic character, as an examination of the present series, which unquestionably represents but a single species, shows the number to range from eight to twenty, while in a single specimen the disparity in the number of spines on these margins of the two tibiae is as much as four (eight and twelve) .
This species is found over a considerable area, having been recorded from as far north as Matto Grosso, Brazil (Bruner), and Aguiarenda, Bolivian Chaco (Giglio-Tos) , south to the Rio Colorado (Bruner), east to Montevideo, Uruguay (Brunner), west to Tucuman, Argentina (Giglio-Tos).

This very extensive series is of considerable interest, demonstrating as it does that the species is undoubtedly common within its range and that considerable variation in size and sculpture occurs.
The size extremes of the series are: length of body, d^ 36.7-45.5 mm., 9 63.5-82.5; length of head, d' 5.3-6.7, 9 8.5-10; length of rostrum, cf 1.2-1.5, 9 2.5-3.8; length of pronotum, cT 7.2-9.8, 9 11.2-13.8; length of tegmen, 9 2.5-2.7; length of cephalic femur, cf 7.1-9, 9 9.3-12.6; length of caudal femur, d' 14.8-18, 9 20.827.5.
Both extremes of the male sex are from Mendoza, the minimum of the female sex from Blanco Encalada and the maximum from Chacras de Coria.
The wings of the female vary in the shape of the exposed coriaceous portion, this ranging from broad ovate to elongate elliptical, the size variation of the same being considerable and in no way correlated with the general size.
The rostrum exhibits a very appreciable amount of variation in the female, ranging from a length hardly greater than that of the eye to one and one-half times the length of the same.
The spiniform tubercles on the cephalic and caudal margins of the pronotum and the spiniform lobes of the mesonotum vary considerably in prominence, the latter also in the degree of their erection, being vertical in some and decidedly inclined caudad in other individuals.
The linear rugosities of the body show some variation in prominence which does not appear to be correlated with the development of the tubercles and lobes.
The only evidence of geographic variation seen in the series is that noticed in the slenderer pronotum of the male and immature female from Alto Pencosa, a locality somewhat removed from those at which the other specimens were taken.
The color varies from dull brown through gray-browns to hoary white, but how much of the brownish coloration is due to discoloration cannot be determined.
Some individuals are partially blackish, but this is unquestionably due to discoloration, as the specimens were not eviscerated.
The following diagnosis shows the features in which the previously undescribed male differs from the female.
Size small; form more elongate than in the other sex; surface much smoother than in the female.
Head with its dorsal length two-thirds that of the pronotum, considerably constricted caudad of the eyes, the whole head considerably elevated cephalo-dorsad ; fastigium horizontal, much shorter than in the female, hardly more than half the length of the eye, apex very blunt; eyes very prominent, ovate in outline, their length more than half that of the proximal portion of the dorsum of the head; antennae slightly longer than the eye^ five-jointed.
Pronotum subcylindrical, subequal in width except for the expansion at the cephalic margin and the insertion of the cephalic limbs, the former margin truncate mesad with a pair of low flanking tubercles and obliquely truncate laterad; width at the insertion of the cephalic limbs contained two and one-half times in the length of the pronotum, caudal margin non-tuberculate; surface of the dorsum without the prominent ridges found in the female.
No tegmina or wings present.
Caudal margin of the mesonotum non-tuberculate.
Abdomen with the medio-longitudinal carina indicated only caudad; supra-anal plate sublanceolate, apex well rounded, a prominent medio-longitudinal sulcus present on the proximal two-thirds; cerci simple, styliform, short, blunt; subgenital plate moderately rostrate, subacute, carinate ventrad, dorsal face of the apex flattened, sulcate, the apical margin slightly cleft.
Limbs slightly more robust than in the female; caudal femora slightly more bullate, the tips of the femora reaching to the distal margin of the sixth abdominal segment.

This is apparently Covillea (Larrea of authors) divaricata, a shrub which Mr. Jorgensen tells us constitutes an important part of the vegetation of the Mendoza region.
It is probable that the insect spends a considerable part of its life on the twigs of the bush, which it simulates very well and where it would be well protected.
This proclivity is found in certain species of Orthoptera occurring on the allied C tridentata of the Lower Sonoran deserts of North America.
Nine of the pairs in the series were taken "in copula."
The earliest seasonal date that is represented by adults is November 15, a single male from Mendoza bearing that date, the latest June 18, while the first date for a pair in copula is March 6.

One nearly adult female.
The present specimens are referred to this species with some uncertainty, as certain points of difference from the original description are evident, although how much weight to allow these differences is a matter of question, as series of the allied A. chloropterum and compadum show considerable variation in size and sculpture.
Brunner knew" only the female of the species, and his type specimen was considerably smaller than either of the adult females before us, although larger than the immature one.
This size difference is, however, about equalled in our series of compactum.
Brunner used the serrulate or smooth condition of the margins of the ovipositor jaws as one of the major division characters for the species of the genus, placing chloropterum and compactum in the serrulate section and granulosum and foliatum in the other.
As a matter of fact, chloropterum is very similar to foliatum in having verj^ weak serrulations on the margins of the dorsal valves, while compactum has the serrulations very decided.
Aside from size, the description oi foliatum, based on the female sex, agrees with that sex of the present series in all the characters except the number of spines on the margins of the caudal tibiae and in the character of the caudal margin of the pronotum.
The number of spines is unimportant, as a count shows they run from nine to twelve on the external margin (Brunner gives thirteen) and from nine to eleven on the internal (Brunner gives eleven).
One specimen has nine on each of the margins and another has a difference of two spines on the same margins of the two tibiae.
The pronotum is described as "margine antico et postieo in lobos binos foliatos, obtusos productis," and in the present material these margins are strongly bispinose, but hardly developed in foliate lobes.
18 Given in error as "Fig.
12B" in the text, but the explanation to the plates shows that "B" refers to compactum and "C" to foliatum.

Ten males, eight females.
This interesting series has been compared with thirteen other individuals of the genus from localities in Brazil and Paraguay.
It is evident that considerable individual variation in several charac^ The original material was credited to DeGeer, and he subsequently says {Mem.
Ins., Ill, p. 499) he received the species from Pennsylvania, sent by Acrelius.
ters is present in the species, while it also passes into the following form which is merely a geographic race.
The size varies considerably, even in series from the same locality, while the coloration is modified by the variable intensity of the blackish or brownish postocular bars which margin the lateral carinse ventrad.
The dorsum of the head and pronotum is either uniform in color or supplied with a pair of narrow velvet}^ blaxik lines, which diverge caudad and margin the lateral carinse on their internal edge.
These lines are variable in intensity and also in continuity, those on the head sometimes being parallel and again regularly divergent and continuous with their pronotal section.
Several individuals from the Misiones and Sao Paulo, Brazil, are more or less completely sprinkled with fine blackish-brown punctations, in this respect resembling similarly colored individuals of Chloealtis conspersa and Psolaessa texana.
The lateral carinse of the pronotum are variable in character, in some individuals being decidedly discontinuous at the transverse sulcus and continuous in others.
In the latter specimens the carinse are slightly but regularly divergent through their entire length, while in the other type they are more or less decidedly offset laterad at the sulcus, subparallel on the prozona and slightly divergent or (more frequently) subparallel on the metazona.
These two types have no geographic significance, cannot be correlated with size, and in color only that all of the continuous type have the supplementary dorsal lines of black.
Some individuals are almost intermediate in the character of the carinse, and similar variation is found in 0. pagana minor.
The typical form of the species ranges from Rio Janeiro, Brazil west to at least Formosa, Argentina, extending south only as far as Resistencia Chaco and Misiones, Argentina, northward and westward apparently grading into 0. p. minor, specimens from Chapada and Corumba, Matto Grosso, Brazil, being nearer cotypes of Giglio-Tos' form.

The Jujuy male fully agrees with the cotypic material, and typical individuals of the two forms can be separated by the following features: A.
— Form more robust; tegmina broader, less elongate; head broader, eyes prominent, shorter, fastigium broad 0. pagana.
AA.
— Form slenderer; tegmina more elongate, narrower; head narrower, eyes less prominent, longer, fastigium narrow, more elongate 0. pagana minor.
This race is prol^ably restricted in its typical form to the Bolivian Chaco and the adjacent portions of Argentina (Jujuy).
Material from Chapada and Corumba, Matto Grosso, Brazil, is rather intermediate between the present subspecies and true pagana, but somewhat closer to minor.

The coloration of this individual is essentially the same as the other two of that sex, but there is no trace of the carinse.
Doubtless this genus is similar in this respect to Eriteitix, which has the supplementary carinse present or absent in the same species from the same locality.22 The locaUties from which this species has been recorded are Cordoba, Carcarana, and Alto Pencosa, Argentina; Sapucay, Paraguay, and Montevideo, Uruguay.

These individuals are typical of the new ''form," which is merely a long-winged phase of punctata, possibly the exclusive or predominating form in certain regions, but found also in a number of localities as we have it in our series from Sapucay, Paraguay (two individuals) and the Misiones (one individual).
In the San Juan series green is the predominating color in the females, although one of that sex is brown, as is the Pedregal female.
The Misiones series is, with the exception of the ''elongata" individual, "elegans" and "intricata" inextricably confused, with typical individuals and intergrades.
The species is found over the greater portion of tropical America south at least to the parallel of Buenos Aires.

These specimens have been compared with paratypic females.
We feel compelled to differ from Bruner^^ in placing this species in a genus {Aynblysca'pheus) distinct from Staurorhectus longicornis, the type of the latter genus.
We have examined a considerable number of specimens of the two species and find that the two characters given as diagnostic of Amhlyscapheus are not in this case important enough to be of generic value.
These two are the "entire absence of lateral carinse on the pronotum" and the "valves of the ovipositor very blunt."
The first character is one which is very strongly approached if not absolutely reached in our series of longicornis, while the second character, although constant, is of slight degree, not worthy in the present case of generic value.
The claim of the genus Amhlyscapheus for recognition is, however, completely destroyed by its author in the recent description of a species of the genus Staurorhectus, S. inter medius,-^ which has as characters the following: "lateral carinse of the pronotum almost obliterated on the anterior lobe" and "valves of ovipositor similar to those of Amhlyscapheus glaucipes Rehn (lineatus Bruner)."
As the male was previously unknown, the following are its principal differences from the opposite sex.
Size small; form similar to that of the female.
Head with the eyes slightly more prominent than in the female, face more retreating than in the other sex; interspace between the eyes distinctly narrower than the width of one of the eyes; frontal costa with the margins more subparallel and the sulcus deeper than in the female; antennae as long as the caudal femur, slightly deplanate proximad.

We have before us several typical specimens of this species loaned by Prof. Bruner and we are forced to the conclusion that he erred in associating female specimens with converging lateral carinse to the pronotum with males having those carinae non-converging.
The former are to our mind prasinus, which varies in the coloration of the dorsum of the pronotum.
Our two females agree with the males in the character of the lateral carinse and the coloration.
One of the females is larger than the other, the measurements of the two being as follows : 23 Fig.

It is evident that this species has at least two color phases, one largely green and the other several shades of brownish, the latter in the extreme condition with little contrast in tones.
In addition to these phases there is one form which has the dorsum of the pronotum uniform in color, and another with broad lateral longitudinal iDars of velvety black on the same.
The above-listed female and a typical female from Cordoba, loaned by Prof. Bruner, have the uniform pronotum, one in the green phase, the other in the brown phase.
The Chacras de Coria male and a female from Cordoba, from Bruner and labelled schulzi by him, have the dorsum of the pronotum barred, the Chacras de Coria male being a well-contrasted brownish individual and the female strongly approaching the green phase.
The lateral carinae of the pronotum are the same in all of thespecimens, converging caudad to the first transverse sulcus, thence regularly diverging.
In the male the tegmina are proportionately longer than in any other species of the genus and the whole form of the same sex is decidedly compressed.

This extensive series shows that the species varies tremendously in size and color, in these respects being parallelled by similar variation in the closely allied, if at all distinct, North American T. vinculata.
The same variations in general size, color tone, width, intensity, solidarity, and curve of tegminal bands, intensity and width of wing band, tone of wing disk and colors of ventral sulcus of caudal femora are noted as in vinculata.
The rugosity of the metazonal disk varies individually in both sexes, while the caudal angle of the pronotum shows variants ranging from slightly obtuse to slightly acute, the majority having it rectangulate.
The species has a very considerable range, having been recorded from north-central Mexico south to at least as far as the provinces of Santa Fe, Cordoba, San Luis, and Mendoza, Argentina.

This very interesting series throws some light on the color phases of the species.
It is apparent that three are present: first, a green phase, which was that originally described by Giglio-Tos; second, a brownish or dull wine-colored phase, and, third, a speckled phase.
The green phase shows Uttle variation in itself aside from that in the yellowish tone of the green base color and the more or less pronounced character of a yellowish wash on the dorsal section of the tegminal 33 After examining the literatm-e involved, we can substantiate what Bruner fAnn Carneg Mus., VIII, p. 38, footnote) has said regarding the proper status of Blanchard's genus Paulinia.
It is clearly the same as Ccelopterna bt&l, which name it should replace, and in no way related to Ossa Gigho-Tos, which through an unfortunate preoccupation must fall, and in place ot which Bruner has erected Parossa.
bases.^^ The brownish phase varies in tone from pale dull wine color (vinaceous) and clay color to burnt umber, the caudal femora in the extreme condition with more or less apparent transverse dark bars on the dorsal face, and in the same pronounced type the caudal tibise are of the general tone.
The brownish phase and the normal greenish phase are apparently connected by intermediate types, some individuals being of the green phase with the dorsum of the pronotum and the tegmina weakly vinaceous, while other specimens, which otherwise would be referred to the brownish phase, have yellowish the underlying color, the femora unhanded and the tibise of the glaucous of the green phase.
The speckled phase also shades into both of the other forms and is characterized by a mottling of bistre, olive-green, or bay over the underlying bright gamboge to lemon-yellow of the pronotum and head of those specimens approaching the green phase and over burnt umber in the single (Jujuy) specimen approaching (or rather in) the brownish phase.
These fine mottlings are either general on the dorsum or grouped in two irregular longitudinal bars, which are postocular in their position, the interocular portion of the head also being much suffused.
In the extreme condition of this phase the femora are moderately banded dorsad, the tibise being of the color which the general tone of the individual more nearly approaches.
These phases are not geographic, as the Mendoza series has all three, but apparently a certain type is more numerous in one locality than in others.
All of the Potrerillos material is either in or very closely approaching the speckled phase, while, aside from several brownish individuals, all of the Chacras de Coria representatives are in or very near the green phase.
There is considerable size variation, but this appears to be individual and not geographic.
The range of the present species is known to extend from the Bolivian Chaco (Caiza and San Francisco, cotypic individuals being before us) and Jujuy, south to the Provinces of Santa Fe (Carcarana), Cordoba, San Luis (Alto Pencosa), and Mendoza {vide supra).

With Parossa it agrees in the general form of the occiput and interocular region, the reduction of spines on the pronotum and tubercles on the limbs, the non-spiniform ventrocaudal angles of the lateral lobes and the rounded internal angle of the mesosternal lobes ; while from Parossa it differs in the subrostrate interantennal portion of the frontal costa, the tuberculate caudal margin of the pronotal disk, the scabrous dorsum of the same, the peculiar coriaceous texture and subnodulose surface of the tegmina, in this respect resembling Ommexecha and Spathalium, and in the abbreviate, robust form.
Form robust, abbreviate; surface of head, pronotum, and femora multituberculate; head, pronotum, venter, and limbs, but particularly the latter two, strongly villose.
Occiput buUate; interocular region very broad, greatly exceeding the width of the eye, greatly declivent, non-impressed; frontal costa subrostrate between the antennse, evanescent ventrad, sulcate dorsad; eyes subglobose.
Pronotum robust, greatest dorsal width subequal to its length; prozona hardly elevated, metazona depressed cephalad, transversely elevated caudad; cephalic margin slightly emarginate mesad, caudal margin very broadly obtuse-angulate with three pairs of marginal nodes; lateral lobes with the ventro-caudal angle very broadly rounded, non-spiniform.
Tegmina broad, sublanceolate, apex moderately rounded; texture coriaceous; surface without decided nodes, but with certain of the transverse veins of the discoidal and anal fields slightly elevated.
Wings perfectly developed.
Interspace between the mesosternal lobes very decidedly transverse, the margins of the lobes rounded; metasternal interspace more transverse than the mesosternal one.

One male, two females.
The present specimens are clearly referable to this species, which was previously known only from the original description.
Two facts are evident from the material before us, these being that the species is dichromatic and that the length of the tegmina and wings varies greatly in the same.
The type was of a greenish color phase, which is almost matched by one of the females in hand, the green of the tegmina apparently being more extensive than in the type, as it colors the adjacent portions of the marginal and anal fields of the tegmina as well as the discoidal as described.
The other individuals are of a similar pattern, but in several tones of brown with no evidence of green.
The tegmina show considerable length variation as well as some in the form of the apex of the same.
The latter may be acute-angulate without any trace of bluntness or of similar general outline, with the immediate apex narrowly rounded.
The wings are described as "dimidise elytrorum longitudinis, " while in one of the present females the wings are about two-thirds of the tegminal length, and in the other they fall but little short of the tegminal apices when in repose.
In the male the wings are subequal to the tegmina when closed.

'5 The specimens from Chapada, Matto Grosso, Brazil, recorded by us as Spathalium cyanopterum (Proc.
U. S. Nat.
Mus., XXXVI, p. 110), we find on re-examination to be S. klugii (Bm-meister), which Bolivar synonymized under S. serrulatum Thunberg, the type of Burmeister's species having been examined by him.
There seems no doubt but that his description of "serrulatum" was in part drawn from this specimen.
On examination of the original description of serrulatum we have been unable to positively place the species, but it does not seem to be the same as klugii.
Kirby {Syn.
Catal.
Orth., Ill, p. 298) has given the synonymy correctly and permitted both names to stand.
Bruner, unfortunately, has redescribed klugii as S. bolivari (Ann.

Our material fuUy agrees with his description and that of Burmeister and of Bohvar.

All of these specimens, except the March 30 female, have the tegmina distinctly maculate, the exception having the discoidal field with the faintest possible indication of the usual blotching.
The male and female taken March 30 were in coitu, and the two represent the extremes in maculation of the discoidal field of the tegmina.
The anal field of the tegmina is unicolorous in all of the specimens.
Information with one specimen is to the effect that the species is "common."
Northward this form has an extensive range, while the southern border of its distribution extends from Jujuy (Giglio-Tos) eastward to Buenos Aires (Giglio-Tos) and Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Rehn).

Six males, eight females.
The Buenos Aires specimens are typical of the species, while the Misiones series is referred here with some doubt, differing much as does the Sapucay, Paraguay representation previously examined by us."
The pronotum is, in the Misiones specimens, more compressed than in Buenos Aires individuals, the fastigium shorter and broader in the male, being more of an equilateral triangle, and the coloration different, the median line of the pronotum being much narrower, while the humeral regions of the pronotum of the male are washed with dull purplish and the caudal tibiae of the same sex are wax yellow to pale orange, without reddish as in typical viridicata.
The females have the tibiae green as in Buenos Aires specunens, the spines and tarsi usually without sanguineous, although this is indicated in two Misiones individuals.
It is probable that the Sapucay and Misiones series are specifically or subspecifically distinct from viridicata, but we have refrained from recognizing their differences with a name.
It seems more desirable at present to get a better conception of the real value of these differences, which can only be done by the acquisition of more material from a number of localities.
This species has been recorded from points extending from the tj^pe locality north to Chapada, Matto Grosso, Brazil.

We have before us specimens from Merida, Yucatan, contained in the Hebard Collection, which agree absolutely with the original description of miles.
The material from Argentina and Paraguay shows certain constant differences which have already been emphasized by Pictet and Saussure.^^ Any expression of the exact relationship of the material from the two regions seems best withheld, until at least sufficient series from other localities can be examined, thus enabling us to judge more clearly how constant over definite regions apparent differences are.
The Merida individuals, seven in number, are constant and typical.
All of the Argentine and Paraguayan specimens seen are duller with the pale maculations more orange-rufous than yellow, the wings with the pale areas brick red or orange, the pale occipital bars narrower and the pale areas of the caudal margin of the pronotum usually not continuous, but broken 28 In studying the present series of this species we have made a rather extensive re-examination of our material of this and allied forms, as well as the literature bearing on the subject.
It is in consequence necessary to correct certain previous references which are erroneous on account of a confusion of 7niles and stolli.
Bruner's first reference of stolli (Sec.
Rep. Merch.
Locust Invest.
Coram.
Buenos Aires, p. 60) should be credited to tniles, as material before us studied and determined by him at that time shows.
Specimens of stolli from British Guiana, also from him, we find labelled 7niles in his handwriting.
The present author, partly by following these determinations, is responsible for the following misidentifications, which should refer to C. miles.

These specimens have been compared with individuals from Sapucay, Paraguay, and a female from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, received from and determined by Saussure.

25.5 There is also an appreciable amount of variation in the general form, some specimens, irrespective of sex, being more compressed than others, more noticeably so in the male than in the female, and quite irrespective of locality.
A casual examination would lead one to suppose that two species were present, but careful study shows that the extremes cannot be separated on account of the intermediate individuals.
The median carina of the pronotum shows some variation in prominence in both sexes.
In color there is marked variation in the shade of blue on the disk of the wing, in some individuals this being nile blue, flax flower blue (Ridgway) in others, running through heliotrope purple to phlox purple.
This variation does not appear to be correlated with sex, locality, size, or degree of compression.
The caudal tibiae also vary in general color from cream to scarlet vermilion dorsad, with the ventral surface very pale apple green.
Information with one specimen is to the effect that the species is gregarious.
Its range is known to extend from Chapada, Matto Grosso (Bruner), and Rio Grande do Sul (Rehn), Brazil, to the Misiones.

The Jujuy individual, alone of the series, has the proximal portion of the external face of the caudal femora more olive green than in the other specimens and blending into the blackish disto-median band.
There is no tendency in the series to approach the Brazilian Z. tarsata (Serville) .
The northern limit of the range of the present species is not definitely known, as most of the records are confused with tarsata, but to the southward, where cruentata alone is found, its range is given by Bruner as "central and northern Argentina."
The above records and that from Buenos Aires (Giglio-Tos) are the most southern definitely known ones.

The pale head and pronotal lines vary from dull straw yellow to clay color, the pale areas of the caudal femora closely agreeing with this color, while the darker pronotal bars vary from dark oil green to purplish brown; the dark areas of the pleura and caudal femora agree in color with the dark pronotal bars.
The previous records of this species are from Montevideo (Serville) and Patagonia (Pictet and Saussure).

These specimens vary considerably in the tone of both the dark and light base colors, the former being olive green in some, blackish in others, while the pale shade varies from nearly clear yellow or creamy yellow to decided dull orange.
The single immature individual was taken April 3, 1907.
This species ranges from Buenos Aires west to the Cordillera de Mendoza, while to the north or south we know nothing of the limits of its distribution.

This species appears to us to be an Atrachelacris and not a Dichroplus as described.
From A. unicolor it differs in the more elongate and distad subfalcate cerci of the male, more compressed form, broader fastigium, broader and distinctly sulcate dorsal section of the frontal costa, shorter and smaller eyes and more mottled greenish coloration.
There is no close relationship of this form to A .
gramineus Bruner.
*2 In addition to the above specimens, we have before us a single female from Sapucay, Paraguay (Hebard Collection), taken January 20, 1905 (Foster).
The only difference worthy of note is that in the Sapucay female the fastigium is even wider than in the Misiones female.
The localities from which the species is known are Chapada, Matto Grosso, Brazil, Sapucay, Paraguay, and the Misiones, Argentina.

The Buenos Aires and San Juan individuals are similar in coloration to four specimens from Carcarana, Argentina, the San Juan female being slightly smaller than the others of that sex.
The La Carlota, Mendoza, and San Ignacio representatives are very somberly colored with little contrast in the markings, the general tone varying from broccoli brown to clove brown.
The La Carlota specimens have the reduction in contrast more decided than in any of the other individuals, while in size they average larger than the Carcarana specimens.
The females from San Juan and Mendoza Provinces are all slightly or considerably smaller than Carcarana or Buenos Aires individuals of the same sex.
The localities in Mendoza and San Juan here given constitute the western limit of the range of the species.

This very interesting series of one hundred and eleven specimens shows that considerable variation in size and color is present in the species.
Apparently the size variation is more geographic and enviromnental than individual.
The San Juan and Caucete series are very similar in proportions and size, such individual variation In the latter as is noticed being found in both lots.
The La Paz, Pedregal, Mendoza, and large portion of the Chacras de Coria and San Ignacio series are uniformly smaller, with shorter tegmina and consequent more robust appearance.
Two males and two females from San Ignacio and several males from Chacras de Coria are similar in general form to the San Juan and Caucete lots.
A single male from Mendoza is of similar proportions, but the size is no greater than the other Mendoza specimens.
Apparently at these three localities the differences are environmental, as they are decided and correlated with color characters.
Such differences produced by isimilar agencies are frequently found in species of the allied North American genus Melanoplus.
The first color type, which almost invariably has longer tegmina than the second, is always paler, the base color varying from buff to nearly ochraceous, with the median portion of the dorsum more or less suffused with tawny to chestnut.
The postocular bars are always decidedly indicated and the base color of the femora and tibiae in the two forms varies with the general base color.
The second type has the base color nearer gamboge and saffron yellow, but little evident, however, as the overlying suffusion of from clove brown to clay color is, as a rule, heavier and more extensive than in the first type, permitting less contrast between the region of the postocular bars and other areas.
The females of this latter type are much duller than the male.
The dark suffusion of the sharply delimited dorsal two-thirds or so of the external face of the caudal femora varies greatly in intensity, usually more solid and darker in the individuals of the second type.
Representative individuals of both sexes taken at random from the larger series measure as follows: San Juan (Type 1).

We have before us, in addition to the above series, two pairs of typical material from Rosario, received from Bruner.
It is evident that the insect varies greatly in size, wholly individually so it appears.
The Mendoza series alone contains specimens of both sexes showing this very clearly, the extremes of both sexes measuring as follows: length of body, d" 14.3-17.5 mm., 9 20-24.2; length of pronotum, d" 3.3-4, 9 4.2-6; length of tegmen, cT 5.2-6.8, 9 7-9.2; length of caudal femur, cf 8.6-9.5, 9 11-13.
All of the individuals in the present series are brachypterous.
In color the variation is considerable, but apparently this is almost wholly geographic.
The series from Mendoza Province have a more olive green tone than any of the Caucete or San Juan specunens, which are more yellowish on the pale areas and more contrastingly colored.
The species has been reported from the Provinces of Santa Fe, Cordoba, San Luis, San Juan, and Mendoza, Argentina.

Closer to L. hastatus Rehn^ than to any other species of the genus, but differing from that in the smaller size, distinctly narrower and less declivent fastigium, which is also more decidedly excavate, the more compressed pronotum, more angulate caudal margin of the disk of the pronotum, the different sculpture of the supra-anal plate, in the more elongate cerci, which are subfalcate distad, and in the less produced subgenital plate.
The color of the caudal tibiae immediately separates this species from flavipes Bruner, but in addition to that the present species can be distinguished by the narrower distal section of the cerci, shorter subgenital plate, and less declivent and more excavate fastigium.
The female is very similar to that sex of flavipes, but the pronotum is more constricted, with the caudal margin of the lateral lobes straighter and more vertical, and the tibiae are red.

A very peculiar species which seems to be closer to P. bilohus and hrunneri Giglio-Tos than to any of the other forms of the genus.
From the former it can be immediately separated by the absence of decided lobiform furci>la, while from the latter it can readily be distinguished by the heavier, deeper head, the more vertical face, the more elongate supra-anal plate, the more' tapering and strongly incurved cerci, the less produced subgenital plate and very different coloration.
Size medium; form robust.
Head not elevated dorsad of the k-vel of the pronotum, the interocular region and the fastigium regularly declivent; interocular width moderate, slightly greater than the interantennal width of the frontal costa, hardly more than a third the width of the eye; fastigium distinctly transverse, margins distinct and rectangulate, surface of the fastigium and the interocular portion of the vertex very slightly excavate; face moderately retreating, subvertical for a very short distance dorsad, forming a slight obtuse angle at the junction with the fastigium; frontal costa in general subequal in width, the average breadth slightly less than that of the interocular portion of the vertex, strongly narrowing dorsad to the junction with the fastigium, slightly narrowed immediately ventrad of the ocellus, sulcate throughout ; antennae about two and one-half times the length of the pronotum; eye not at all prominent when seen from above, in outline reniform-ovate, the infra-ocular portion of the genae about two-thirds the length of the eye.

These specimens are referred to this species with some little doubt, :as the fastigium is more or less sulcate and the generic description of Tetana says "non sulcato."
The tegmina also appear slightly longer proportionately than in the figure, but the length measurements are in accord with those given by Brunner.
It is also possible that the individuals from Alto Pencosa are distinct from that from San Juan, but the differences noted are probably individual.

This series shows very considerable variation in size and coloration.
In size, the only specimen equalling individuals from Sapucay, Paraguay, previously measured^^ is the single female from the Misiones, all the other representatives being slightly or considerably smaller.
In color, green is the predominating shade, but individuals with buff the base color are from Potrerillos, Mendoza, Chacras de Coria, and Corrientes, while two Jujuy females are much darker, their base tone being clay color.
In all of the brownish individuals the infuscation of the dorsal section of the lateral lobes of the pronotum and the continuation of the same marking distad over the tegmina, margining the tympanum, and the anal field of the same, is more or less decided and umber in color.
In the Jujuy individuals these ' areas are very strongly indicated, the tegmina also being decidedly maculate on the discoidal field with the same shade.
This latter condition is suggested in certain of the buffy specimens.
The species has also been recorded from Buenos Aires (Bruner) and Santa Rosa, Salta (Giglio-Tos), Argentina, .
and Sapucay, Paraguay (Rehn).

It seems probable that L. borrellii Giglio-Tos*^ is either a synonym of the present species or certain of its supposed diagnostic characters are not constant, such as the black median line on the dorsum of the abdomen, which is strongly indicated in most of the specimens (five in all) before us and almost completely absent in one.
The character of insertion of the lateral lobes of the pronotum is susceptible of much latitude in individual interpretation, while the length of the ovipositor and degree of angulation of the subgenital plate are not hard-and-fast characters, as in the first case personal equation is a factor in determining the base of the ovipositor and in the second case the condition of the specimen and the amount of flexure and compression of the plate may lead to different conclusions.
These specimens have been compared with individuals from Sapucay, Paraguay, which is the only locality aside from the type locality and that given above from which the species is known.

This very interesting series gives us some desirable and definite information on the extent of variation in this variable species as found at a single locality.
All of the specimens of the present species are in the color phase which has metallic blue the most striking color characteristic.
The variation here noted are all aside from this base color.
The color of the tegmina also remains nearly uniform in the series, varying only moderately in the depth of the ferruginous or hazel of the same, the distal blackish area present on the tegmina of all of the specimens seen.
The pale maculation on the facial fastigium and that on the fastigium of the vertex are invariably present, as is the broad patch of the same on the ventral portion of the lateral lobes of the pronotum and the obHque pale line on the pleura.
The dorsum of the pronotum may be without pale markings, with a single small median pair or with an increasing number of pairs up to four, these always arranged along the median line and variable in size, but always in symmetrical pairs.
Frequently the pairs run together, forming bars, which tendency in a single extreme specimen is so complete that we have paired pale lines extending from the cephalic ^ Proc.

NOTES UPON SOME LOWEK CALIFORNIAN HELICES.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY.
The receipt of some Helices collected on Cerros (Cedros) Island, Lower California, by Mr. H. N. Lowe, has been made the occasion for giving plates illustrating the Micrariontas of Lower California and offering some notes upon the characters, variation, distribution, and type localities of the several forms.
Information upon the habitats and stations of several species may be found in an article by Mr. Lowe in the Nautilus for July, 1913.
The only recent work of an exact nature upon these snails is in.
a paper published by Doctor W. H. Dall in Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila.
for 1900, in which several new forms are defined.
The fauna stands much in need of investigation by some one who can study the snails on the ground; who will look into the limits and characteristics of the snail colonies, locate them exactly, and keep the snails of different colonies separate.
At present we have little knowledge of the association of forms or the range of variation within a colony.
The first Helices from the Lower Californian coast seem to have been collected by Dr. Hinds, who accompanied Capt.
Belcher as surgeon of H. M. S. Sulphur.
The Sulphur was engaged in work of survey and exploration along the West Coast in 1839, and opportunity for land collecting was had at San Diego and various points northward, San Quintin, Cerros Island, Turtle (San Bartolome) Bay, and Magdalena Bay.
Two species collected by Hinds were described by Pfeiffer in 1845, Helix levis and H. areolata, both reported, in the original descriptions, as from "California," whether Lower or Upper not specified ; moreover, at the time of the Sulphur voyage the differentiation of the Californias seemed a small matter to Europeans, both being equally savage and remote.
During 1846 the Herald and Pandora surveyed parts of the coast — Victoria, Esquimalt Harbor, Port Discovery, Port Townsend, San Francisco Bay, San Nicolas, S. Clemente, San Diego Bay, Los Coronados, San Quintin, Cerros Island, Magdalena Bay.^ A number ^Narrative of the Voyage of H. M. S. Herald during the years 1845-51, by Berthold Seemann, 1853. of West Coast shells were collected, but unfortunatelj^ the localities were badly mixed up, as in the Sulphur shells.
Good accounts of the explorations of Veatch, Gabb, Scammon, and others of that period together with much historical and other information concerning the peninsula may be found in a book issued by the Lower California Company, entitled, "Lower California: Its Geography and Characteristics," New York, 1868.
The most extensive recent reports by scientific observers are those published by the California Academy of Sciences.
These deal chiefly with the Cape region, which differs widely from the peninsula further north by reason of its far greater rainfall.
Helicoid and Bulimoid landsnails living in exposed places usually become more variegated than the related forms from sheltered or shaded places.
When exposed to the sun, the ground color or the whole shell becomes opaque white, an adaptation to exclude light, which would shine through a brown, corneous, or yellowish shell, probably to the detriment of the snail.
Compare Cerion, Hemitrochus, Bulimulus schiedeanus, Leucochroa, etc.
Among snails living in drj^, sunny places, there is also very often a tendency to multiply color-bands, in snails derived from stocks with one or few bands, as in Euparypha, Hemitrochus, Plecto stylus, etc.
This may possibly be protective, as a variegated shell is less conspicuous on a bush or weed than a one-colored shell.
The enhanced color development and variabilitj^ of snails living on trees or other plants lead to the formation of color varieties from diverse variations in different colonies.
Where the topographic and other environmental conditions favor isolation of colonies, permanent races or species result, as among the Partulce and Achatinellce.
When the colonies occasionally mingle by changing conditions of vegetation, etc., we have polymorphic hybrid races — colonies where great individual diversity of pattern or form are seen.
Lower California, exclusive of the Cape region, is probably an area of increasing aridity, like southern Arizona and Sonora, so that there is now a strong tendency towards restriction and consequent isolation of the snail colonies.
The rather wide distribution of some of the species and the polymorphic coloration of many colonies leads us to believe that conditions formerly were much more favorable to migration and mingling of land snails.
Subsidence has also played a part in isolating the snails of the small islands along the coast.
That the changes have often been unfavorable is shown by the dwarfed size of many races, as on San Geronimo, Natividad, and Asuncion Islands.
The irregular apertural thickening, lumps, and uneven "teeth" of some forms of M. levis and others show the unfavorable action of extreme aridity.^ The apparent absence of Helicidse on the comparatively wellwatered southern end of the peninsula is an anomaly.
I cannot help thinking that further search will bring some Helices to light.
It is a region of fine Bulimuli.
In the northeastern part of the peninsula and on the Coronado Islands, Micrarionta stearnsiana Gabb is found.^ Farther down and inland the closely related M. orcutti Dall occurs.
This seems to be constant in its divergence from stearnsiana in the large lot I have seen.
Far off shore on Guadalupe Island is the small M. guadalupiana Dall, a perfectly distinct species of the typical group of Micrarionta.
On the sierra running down the peninsula near the eastern border there are several Sonorella-Wke species, such as Helix lohrii Gabb, unknown anatomically, but probably belonging to the desert group of Micrarionta characteristic of southwestern Arizona and southeastern California.
Micrarionta consists of three rather sharply differentiated groups or sections: (1) Micrarionta typical, small, compact shells with the lip strongly reflexed, insular in distribution, M. rujicincta, gabhi, facta, guadalupiana.
(2) Section Eremarionta for M. desertorum P. & F., includes also M. hutsoni Clapp and probably all the Californian and Lower Californian species which have been referred to Sonorella.
The lip is expanded, shell smooth.
(3) Section Xerarionta for the capacious forms with the lip not expanded or but slightly so, the axis perforate or closed, the shell generally variegated, manybanded.
M. veatchii may be taken as the type of this group, which extends from the Channel Islands of California to Magdalena Bay, on the islands and adjacent shore.

locality uncertain.
On p. 53 of Forbes' article, he states that "Helix kellettii and pandorce, both new, are probably from the same country [i.e., neighborhood of the Columbia River], though the box in which they were contained was marked Santa Barbara. "
On p. 55 he saj'^s, "collected near the Straits of Juan del Fuaco [Fuca].
"'^ The Santa Barbara Island Helix of this type is tnjoni Newc.
H. pandorce must have come from some southern locality.
Since specimens exactly resembling Forbes' figure were taken by Anthony and others on San Benito Island, off the north end of Cerros Island, that place may for the present be taken as the type locality, as no other place has yet afforded shells agreeing so well with Forbes' figures.
San Benito, or "Los Benitos," is west of the north end of Cerros Island and consists of two or three small and very barren islets.
The name has also been spelled "San Bonito" (Captain C. M. Scammon) .
Though we are considering Los Benitos the type locality of H. pandorce, it must be said that we have no definite information of where the original lot was taken.
The Herald touched Cerros Island, and left the Pandora behind to complete the survey.
No further report of the movements of the Pandora is given in the narrative, but it is not unlikely that S. Benito was visited in the course of the survey.
The fact that Forbes named the species for the Pandora may be taken, in the absence of any information to the contrary, as some indication that it was obtained by members of the Pandora's surveying party.
The locality "Santa Barbara, on Margarita Bay, Lower California, Forbes," quoted by Dall, I am unable to confirm, as I can find no place or bay so named on the coast of Lower California, on maps acces.sible to me.
Dall has noted that this small species "varies from white to dark gray above, and below may be white or banded with ashy-gray.
The nucleus is, however, invariably of a livid purplish color, and the surface is dull and conspicuously striate."
It is sometimes pure white (pi.
XV, fig.
23), or has a few diffuse reddish-purple bands on the last whorl (pi.
XV, figs.
21, 22), the apex whitish or dark (fig.
22 photographed abnormally dark).
The typical form (pi.
XV, figs.
17, 18, 19, 20) is dull purplish above and banded below the periphery on a creamy ground, the apex purple * The Spanish Captain de Fuca has recently been canonized by a Cahforniaa conchologist, Bull.

The lip is very slightly expanded, narrowly whitebordered within, and the columellar margin concave with no trace of a tooth.
The embryonic whorl, when unworn, has radial wrinkles as in veatchii; the spire is not granular, and the last whorl shows spiral incised lines.

It was this form which I dissected, under the name of "E. p.

M. pandorw is anatomically similar to veatchii on a smaller scale.
It belongs, I think, nearer veatchii than to any other species.
As in other races of these small arid islands, pandorce is conspicuously reduced in size, probably through the continuous influence of short active and long dormant periods.
The specimens figured are from S. Benito Island, collected by Anthony and Hemphill.

There is never any trace of a columellar tooth.
It was described from Cerros Island, where Veatch collected it in 1859, and the typical form at least is confined to that place.
In specimens collected at the north end of Cerros Island by Mr. H. N. Lowe in 1912 (pi.

The types were smaller, about 23 X 23 mm.
Two of the type lot are figured, pi.

In these the spiral incised lines are less developed than in the larger forms.
The lip is less broadly expanded in many specimens, as in fig.
4, collected by Gabb.
Besides the typical elevated form already noticed, there are several more or less divergent forms found on Cerros Island.
I have referred to these by number, as their status cannot be discussed intelligently until careful field work locates the colonies and gives material for a study of the variations in each.
(1) M. veatchii leucanthea Dall, from the eastern side of Cerros Island (pi.
XV, fig.
10, a cotype, U. S. Nat.
Mus.
No.
107,627) is exactly like the lower forms of veatchii in shape of the shell and the rather broadly expanded lip.
It differs by the absence of distinct bands on the pink-white surface and the more distinct granulation of the entire upper surface.
The shell figured measures, alt.
23, diam.
26 mm., with 5| whorls.
(2) Shells collected on Cerros Island by Hemphill, what part of the island not stated, resemble leucanthea in shape and sculpture, but differ in having the lip expansion very narrow.
In one lot (pi.
XV, figs.
15, 16) the fleshy-brown bands vary from weak and "curdled" (like the traces of a band in leucanthea) to moderately strong.
(3) In another lot (pi.
XV, figs.
13, 14) the last whorl has a pale brown tint; there are no bands whatever, but the surface is strewn with purplish-gray dots, translucent by transmitted light.
The lip expands very narrowly.
(4) Natividad Island, off the south end of Cerros.
A shell collected by Anthony and sent me alive by Dr. Dall (pi.
XV, fig.
12) is banded and streaked profusely with purplish-brown.
The embryo is distinctly wrinkled and the inner whorls following are somewhat granulated; lip narrow.
Alt.

The genitalia of this individual were figured by me as "areolata" in Proc.
A. N. S.
Phila., 1898, pi.

It certainly has nothing to do with the real areolata, but belongs to the veatchii group of forms.
(5) Turtle Bay, collected by Hemphill (pi.
XV, fig.
9), white or pink-white, immaculate or with a few fleshy dots.
Embryonic whorl wrinkled, the rest of the upper surface granulated more or less, lip very narrow.
Resembles varieties (2) and (3), except in color.
(6) Turtle Bay, Hemphill (pi.
XV, fig.
8).
The white or pale embryonic whorl is nearly smooth (in 8 adult shells examined, no young ones seen); granulation appears weakly on the inner whorls, not on the last one or two.
Lip expansion is narrow.
The shell is compactly coiled.
Bands speckled with white, either numerous, as in fig.
8, or reduced in number and intensity (as in fig.
15).

This lot was sent out by Hemphill as "H. areolata var."
(7) Turtle Bay (pi.
XV, fig.

Same as No.
6, but white with the coloring of leucanthea, plus some scattered fleshy dots.
Whether all of the Turtle Bay lots were from one colony or from several is not known.
Mr. Hemphill sorted out his Helices into color forms, thereby destroying all evidence as to the composition of the colonies.
M. veatchii was named in honor of John A. Veatch, who surveyed Cerros Island in search of copper and other minerals in June, July, and August, 1859.
By an error or oversight the name was spelled "veitchii" in the original account.
Micrarionta veatchii canescens (Adams and Reeve).
Text fig.
1.
A series collected by Mr. H. N. Lowe at South Bay, Cerros Island, agrees well with the figures and description of Helix canescens,^ 5 The original description follows: "Helix canescens.
Shell globose, nearly covered perforate, opaque white, ornamented with oblique streaks and several interrupted blackish concentric lines and a conspicuous central band, whorls 5, the last rotund-inflated.
Aperture lunate-rotund, peristome thickened within, callous in the columellar margin.

which was described with the indefinite locality '' Africa" and has not been recognized by subsequent authors, although Tryon has called attention to its resemblance to veatchii, etc.
Part of the specimens (fig.
1, a, h, c) have a columellar tooth; some, as fig.
1,6, have the coloration of Adams and Reeve's type figure in the Zoology of the Samarang, pi.

— Micrarionta v. canescens (A.

The Samarang surveyed from Japan to Borneo, going and returning by the Cape route.
They did not reach American shores, and touched Africa only at the Cape, where no such species as H. canescens is found.
It seems to be one of several species without definite locality which Reeve inserted.
Captain Belcher who commanded the Samarang had previously explored Cerros Island in the ■Sulphur, and probably he added H. canescens to the Samarang shells from his former collection.
By its columellar tooth M. canescens has affinity to M. levis.
Whether it will eventually be united to veatchii or to levis remains to be decided, but it seems deserving of at least subspecific rank.

This is a rather small species (diam.
17 to 20 mm.
), compactly coiled, rather solid though generally somewhat thin, opaque white or very light brown, encircled with many blackish lines and narrow bands, which are more or less interrupted or speckled with white.
The embryonic whorl is usually brown, rarely whitish.
The surface of several post-embryonic whorls is minutely granulated.
The last whorl is not distinctly striated spirally.
Lip hardly expanded,, narrowly thickened within, at the columella it is dilated, and whitecalloused within, the callus often ending abruptly below, or in form of a small tooth.
Whorls 5 in small, up to 5| in large individuals.
Specimens in the Academy are from San Rosario (Orcutt!
); San Geronimo Island, fossil only (H. N.
Lowe!
); Lagoon Heads, Cerros Island, and Turtle Bay (H.
Hemphill!
); Asuncion Island, fossil only (Stearns).
Also reported by Dall from Rosalia Bay, between the second and third localities above.
Pfeiffer records that this species was taken by Hinds in "California."
Hinds, on H. M. S. Sulphur, Capt.
Belcher, visited California and Lower California, stopping October 28, 1839, at Turtle Bay, which is another name for S. Bartolome Bay, or Port, a good harbor a short distance below the projection of the peninsula below Cerros Island.
As Hemphill found the species here in some abundance, I propose to select Port San Bartolome as the t3^pe locality.
The Sulphur landed a party at this place to make observations for position.
The geological features and marine shells are mentioned in Captain Beechey's narrative (Vol.
I, p. 330), and I think it almost certain that Hinds, who was a good collector and conchologist^ picked up the Helix levis here.
Small specimens, such as pi.
XVI, fig.
45, and others of the same lot agree perfectly with Pfeiffer's description and his type figure.
Others from Turtle Bay, such as figs.
42, 43, are larger, more elaborately decorated, and show more of a columellar tooth.
Shells from San Rosario, Cerros Island (fig.
44), and Lagoon Heads, are practically identical with those from Turtle Bay.
All of these places except Cerros Island are on the mainland.
Other localities.
have varying forms, which for the present I have designated by numbers, as follows: (1) Asuncion Island, not far below Turtle Bay, has a somewhat differing race (pi.
XVI, fig.
48).
The bands, translucent instead of brown, are usually fewer and broader — five or six, or sometimes as many as ten.
Granulation indistinct or obsolete.
Diam.
16 to 19 mm.
All the specimens seen from this tiny, barren islet were dug out of fine sand.
It probably occurs only fossil.
It is much like Pfeiffer's figures of levis, but the granulation is scarcely visible^ (2) Var.
crassula Dall (pi.
XV, fig.
24) from Natividad Island (south of Cerros) is like the preceding in having few translucent bands, about 6 in the cotype figured.
It is somewhat heavier than levis of equal size, and is a little more elevated.
No granulation is now visible on the corroded surface.
The columellar callus is heavy and prominent.

(3) The variety from San Geronimo Island (pi.

by H. N. Lowe) resembles crassula in contour and banding.
It is not quite so heavy, has a half whorl less, and is well enough preserved to show traces of granulation on the spire in some examples.
It was found fossil.

14 , ' 151 " 5 " 14 , ' " 14.8 " 5 " ' 18 " (broken) It appears that on these small, barren islets the levis stock has deteriorated in size, often becoming more globose, and finally has died out.
The weak sculpture and usually small number of bands (in comparison with Turtle Bay levis) are probably ancestral characters^ preserved in these isolated colonies.
So far as I know, these diminished races are extinct.
The bands of these helices, brown or blackisk in life, become translucent gray in long dead or fossil specimens.

Helix areolata was described by Pfeiffer from specimens brought liome by Hinds, with no more informing locaUty than ''California."
In a later publication he adds " on the Columbia River in California. "
Several places visited by Hinds on the Sulphur along the coast allow a wide range of choice for the type locality: San Quintin Bay, Cerros Island (where no shells seem to have been collected by Hinds) , Turtle (Bartolome) Bay, and Magdalena Bay, where several days were spent.

I think, therefore, that "Magdalena Bay" should undoubtedly be taken as the type locahty of H. areolata.
Further information is needed to determine the exact place in that neighborhood where shells agreeing with Pfeiffer's figures 10-12 (my text-fig.
2) are found, whether on the mainland or on Margarita Island.
None of the shells before me are exactly localized.
They bear the general locality "Magdalena Bay."
It is evident from the five lots seen that different colonies vary in size, elevation, and degree of maculation.
* Pfeiffer's type and the specimens received from Sowerby are more depressed than most other lots.
The more northern localities cited for areolata by Dr. Cooper and others pertain, I believe, to forms of the levis group, which is known to occur from Asuncion Island northward, a region where areolata does not occur.
The known areas of levis and areolata are separated by a long reach of coast whence no land snails are known.
The Natividad Island specimen I dissected as areolata (1898) is a form of veatchii.
With the exception of var.
exanimata Cooper, areolata is not known to occur elsewhere than about Magdalena Bay, where it inhabits one of the dryest regions in the world.
The shell is opaque white, with ochre-lirown bands broken into square spots, very variable in number and arrangement, as shown in the figures.
In one lot, markings are absent, or indistinct and corneous.
The embryonic whorl is grayish corneous or yellowish corneous.
The columella varies from simple to distinctly toothed.
The size varies.

A REVISION OF THE SPECIES OF THE GENUS NEMOBITJS (ORTHOPTERA .
GRYLLID^) FOUND IN NORTH AMERICA NORTH OF THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA.
BY MORGAN HEBARD.
The genus Nemohius is typical of the group Nemobiites, the other genera of which are more or less aberrant.
The group Nemobiites stands at the head of the subfamily Gryllinae, which is the second division of the family Grylhdse.
All of the species of Nemohius are of small size and are rather delicate in structure; their bodies are covered with long hairs.
The plasticity in certain species, the lack of characters in the male genitalia and the great variability in size, wing length, and coloration, all combine to make the study of the genus difficult.
Added to this, the many incorrect determinations and frequent synonyms have caused the task of correcting the nomenclature to be unusually complex.
An effort is made in the present paper to afford sufficient information for subsequent workers to be able satisfactorily to determine material of either sex, but it is certain that, especially in the males of some species, no single specific character can be considered absolutely trustworthy, and careful consideration of all the specific differences must be made before a safe conclusion can be reached.
The large series of different species before us show conclusively that, where some character may be safely relied upon in a large series of the same species from one region, that character is often obscure or unreliable in series from other portions of the insects range and in consequence can only be used to supplement the combination of characters found in that species.

Genotype — Nemobius {Neviohius) sylvestris [Acheta sylvestris] (Bosc), selected by Kirby, 1906.
Generic Description.— ^ize small; form compact; body pub.escent and sparsely clothed with long chsetiform hairs.
Head rounded, a little flattened in front; interantennal protuberance feeble, obtuse and rather large; eyes oval, rather protuberant; maxillary palpi with distal extremity of terminal joint very moderately oblique.
Pronotum a little wider cephalad than the head; lateral lobes with ventral margin horizontal, the ventro-cephalic and ventro-caudal angles projecting about the same and similarly rounded.
Tegmina complete or abbreviate; in the male furnished with a rather simple tambourine, having only a single ulnar (oblique) vein which is longitudinal, lengthened, developing from the angle of the stridulating (anal) vein; in the female the dorsal field is furnished with few but prominent longitudinal veins connected by transverse veinlets which are directed at right angles to the veins; the tegmina are always present in the North American species and are rounded at the apex; lateral field of tegmina occupied by five or six simple veins which are free from their bases.
Wings strongly developed, abbreviate or absent.
Ovipositor slender, long and straight, or shorter and very gently arcuate; apex very little enlarged, in all of the North American species the portion formed by the dorsal valves is armed with serrations or serrulations, the portion formed by the ventral valves is unarmed or supplied with minute, very widely spaced serrulations.
Cerci of both sexes moderately long, tapering, and covered with hairs.
Cephalic tibiae supplied with a few long slender hairs, caudal face only bearing a distinct tympanum, corresponding portion of cephalic face slightly swollen.
Caudal femora greatly dilated; caudal tibiae with dorsal margin armed with a double row of extremely long, widely spaced, mobile spines (in the North American species, four pairs are present on each tibia), and armed distad with three pairs of well developed spurs, the dorso-internal longer than any of the other distal spurs.
Caudal metatarsus non-sulcate and unarmed dorsad, the distal extremity armed on both sides with long spines, of which the internal is much the longer, and above these are situated two minute teeth.
Morphological Notes.
— In the present genus the spines and spurs of the caudal tibiae are extremely interesting.
In the study of the North American species Mr. A. N. Caudell first pointed out to the author a character in the distal spurs of the caudal tibiae which proves to be absolutely constant and of the greatest value.
In four groups of North American species the internal disto-ventral spur is much longer than the external disto-ventral spur, in the remaining group these spurs are exactly equal in length.
In the males of all of the North American species the proximointernal spine of the caudal tibia is highly specialized in structure.
It differs from the other spines in being very short, large at the base, irregularly conical, suddenly attenuate and soft to the immediate apex which is sharply pointed.
The enlarged base is hard, of dark color and polished, the soft portion is light in color and somewhat translucent, while the immediate apex is hard and rather dark in color.
Frequently the hard apex is missing, and in such cases there is every indication that it has been broken off.
PanteP has carefully discussed this peculiar specialization in his interesting morphological studies in the present genus, and it has been casually noted in certain species by other authors."
We find other interesting characters in the spines of the caudal tibiae of the North American species of the genus.
In all of the species having the disto-ventral spurs unequal in length the spines (with the exception of the proximo-internal spine in the males, which we have discussed above) are above rounded and hairy, below concave with the margins of this sulcation minutely serrulate.
In all of the species having the disto-ventral spurs equal in length, the disto-internal spine in the males is somewhat swollen near its base and its shaft is appreciably bent; the other spines (likewise with the exception of the proximo-internal spine in the males) are above rounded and hairy, below concave, but with the margins of this sulcation smooth.

caudal tibiae are uncinate; smooth, sharp, and hard.
Pantel has also discussed the peculiarities of the distal (or fourth) internal spine of the caudal tibia in his paper, where he has also given an excellent figure of the spines and spurs of the caudal tibia in the male and female of Nemobius Uneolatus Brulle.
In the species having the disto-ventral spurs equal in length, the internal dorsal and median spurs have lateral fringes of hairs on these spurs more prominent and regular than in the other species.
Comparison with Other Genera.
— When compared with the genus to which it is most nearly related, Paranemohius Saussure, we find that Nemobius can be easily separated by the following characters: the lateral lobes of the pronotum are quadrate, not oblique; the tegmina of the male are provided with a tympanum; the vertex is slightly convex, not excavate and rostrate; the caudal tibiae are each armed with six, not five, distal spurs.
The genus of next nearest relationship is Caconemobius Kirby, which differs in the lateral lobes of the pronotum which are not quadrate, the organs of flight which are absent and the cephalic tibiae which have no tympanum.
From the other more nearly related genera, Nemobius may be readily separated by the characters found in the caudal tibiae which are armed with long, mobile, pilose spines and in the caudal metatarsi which are neither sulcate nor serrate dorsad.
Distribution of the Genus in North America.
— The northern boundary of the range of the genus is known to extend from Prince Edward Island westward across Canada to Calgary, Alberta; from the latter locality it has been found southward in the Yellowstone National Park and the Salt Lake Valley in Utah, these localities showing its extreme western distribution until southern Utah is reached, in which latitude it has been taken at St. George, Utah, Las Vegas, Nev., and the Panamint Valley in California to the Pacific coast at Los Angeles.
The genus is apparently found everywhere else in the United States and Mexico south to the Isthmus of Panama, although the very few records from southern Mexico, Nicaragua, and Costa .Rica may possibly indicate that in these southern regions the genus is very scarce.
In the West Indies the genus has been taken in the Bahamas, Cuba, and Granada.
We consider the northern distribution of the genus in the Dominion of Canada probably limited by the spruce belt only, but so little work has been done so far north that nothing definite can at present be stated.
No specimens have been taken in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and on the majority of the West Indian islands, but careful work will show that the genus is well distributed in these regions with scarcely any doubt.
No material is known from Yucatan, Honduras, Salvador and Panama, where the genus will almost certainly be found, though very possibly in few numbers.
History.
— The important references to the genus which apply to the North American species have already been given.
Walker described the genus Argizala in 1869,^ which genus is monotypic and was synonymized by Saussure in 1877^ under Nemohius.
We consider Argizala to be a valid subgenus, distinguished from the subgenus Allonemobius by the very large size, peculiar glossiness, much more transverse pronotum, longer spines of the caudal tibia and ovipositor with apex armed above with serrulations.
This subgenus will probably be found to belong chiefly to the South American fauna when the species of the present genus from that continent have been carefully studied.
Nemohius hrasiliensis, the genotype, is the only species of this subgenus known from North America.
The following North American species have l)een wrongly referred to the genus Nemohius.
In 1842, De Haan in Temminck'^ recorded two species of the genus Anaxipha as Gryllus (Nemohius) pulicarius and pumilus; this caused Walker to refer the first of these species with a query to Nemohius in 1869."
Scudder described Nemohius circumcinctus in 1868,'^ which name was used by Walker,^ Thomas,^ and Saussure^*^ until 1896, when the species was correctly synonymized as Proihacustes mexicana Saussure by the original author of the synonym."
In 1896,^Scudder described two species of Gryllidae as Nemohius distinguendus and ensifer, and later in the same year^^ two more species as Nemohius pictus and delicatus.
All four of these species unquestionably belong to the genus Miogryllus, as our examination of the types show.
Saussure in the next year^^ followed Scudder 3 Cat.

In 1906/5 Kirby followed Scudder in quoting pictus as a Nemohius, but two years later Rehn and Hebard^^ correctly quoted the species for the first time as a Miogryllus.
Kirby also gives Nemohius exiguus Say in his list/^ though that species has long been known to belong to the genus Anaxipha.
Examination of the types shows that Nemohius alleni Morse/^ belongs to a different genus.
An exotic species has been recorded as a North American species but once.
In 1906, CaudelP^ recorded as Nemohius fasciatus from Sapucay, Paraguay, specimens of the South American species Nemohius rufus.
The following records cannot be determined without examination of the material.
Theresa of Bavaria's-" record of Nemohius exiguus from Brazo de Loba, Lower Magdalena River, Colombia, South America, and Woodworth's-^ records of Nemohius mexicanus and neomexicanus from California.
We have omitted Nemohius trinitatis Scudder, owing to the fact that until additional material from Trinidad is secured little definite can be said of this insect.
The type series is in bad condition, and we feel justified in stating only that the specimens belong to the subgenus Eunemobius and may prove to be an insular race of Nemohius carolinus.
Though the type series are all from the South American fauna, the specimens recorded by Brunner-as Nemohius cuhensis from Balthazar, Granada, have been examined and found to belong probably to this insect.
Material Examined.
— ^2,088 specimens: 890 males, 1,144 females and 54 nymphs.

A large portion of the material is located in the author's collection, that of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and the Hebard Collection ex Bruner.
We are deeply indebted to Mr. W. S. Blatchley, Dr. E. M. Walker, and Mr. Charles A. Hart for the loan of their types of the genus; to Dr. Samuel Henshaw, for the privilege of studying all of the types and other material in the Scudder Collection and to Mr. A. N. Caudell, for the opportunity of studying the types of Nemobius in the National Museum and the loan of that institution's entire collection of Nemobius with the exception of the types.
Mr. W. T. Davis, Messrs. Sherman and Brimley, Professor A. P. Morse, Mr. J. Chester Bradley, Mr. Charles Schaeffer of the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, and Mr. Lutz of the American Museum of Natural History, have also been very kind and have aided us greatly in sending their collections of Nemobins for examination.

The present key is of necessity somewhat involved owing to the difficulties found in the present genus and commented upon at the beginning of this paper.
In some species it may be seen that certain characters, which are of little or no value in the majority of species, are of great importance.
The color pattern of the head is distinctive in Nemobius maculatus, ambitiosus, griseus and griseus funeralis.
The coloration of the maxillary palpi is distinctive in Nemobius carolinus and its races and particularly so in confusus.
Certain important differences exist in the North American species of the genus which are of sufficient value to warrant the erection of four subgenera and the recognition of Walker's Argizala as another subgenus.
A study of all the species of Nemobius of the world would probably show the advisability of considering some of these groups separate genera, while many other groups not found in North America would constitute still other genera and subgenera.
The genotype of Nemobius is Nemobius sylvestris of Europe, which species belongs to a group differing very widely from any of those here treated in the following combination of characters.
Spines of caudal tibia unmodified in both sexes, disto-ventral spurs of same unequal, but not nearly as much so as in the North American species having this character.
Ovipositor longer than caudal femur, nearly rigidly straight; apex very narrowly sublanceolate and wholly unarmed.
Color pattern of head distinctive.
Nemobius sylvestris bears a superficial resemblance to Nemobius aynbitiosus.
Examination of other exotic species shows that the genus Nemobius is divided into numerous natural groups everywhere in its distribution as in North America.
A number of species treated in the present paper are found in both brachypterous and macropterous forms, while others are known from brachypterous or macropterous individuals only.
These facts have been treated under the Biological Notes for each species, as habit and environment appear to have been chiefly instrumental in such development.
These differences are almost wholly without value as specific characters, and, since they have been frequently so used^ have given rise to much confusion in the past literature.

[Fergus Falls, Minn.] The present species finds its nearest relatives in .V.
maculatus and N. griseus.
From macidatus, typical fasciatus may be separated by its larger size, more uniform general coloration, striped occiput, longer and less decidedly truncate tegmina in both sexes and in the female by the teeth of the dorsal margin of the apex of the ovipositor, which in fasciatus are rather prominent but not very sharp, while in maculatus these teeth are as prominent and verj' sharp.
The ovipositor in typical fasciatus is also longer and not so rigidly straight.
From griseus the present species may be readily distinguished by its more robust proportions in even the smallest race, A'', fasciatus abortivus, the different general coloration, and also in characters of the ovipositor which in griseus are much as in maculatus.
In fasciatus the lower face is never darker than the interocular portion of the same, while in griseus the lower face is strikinglj' darker than the other portions of the head.
Certain individuals of this plastic species approach maculatus closely in general appearance, and those before us from Tobermory, Ont., Mount Pleasant, N. J., and Sulphur Springs, N. C, recorded, respectively, by E. M. Walker, Rehn, and Rehn and Hebard as that species, do indeed bear it a close resemblance.
There are a number of other specimens in the present series likewise differing from typical fasciatus in being small, highly colored and more or less tawny, from numerous localities extending from New Jersey to North Carolina.
No specimens in this series, however, have the peculiar color pattern of maculatus, nor the compact structure and tegminal outline of that species.
From the form here discussed to typical fasciatus, every gradation may be found in the material before us.
The series of specimens from Thompson's Mills, Ga., recorded by Allard as N. canus bear a resemblance to the aberrant individuals discussed above, but are considerably larger and still more highly colored as described in the color notes on the following page.
These specimens in consequence have a general fasces very different from that of typical fasciatus.
Type: 9 ; Pennsylvania.

[De Geer Collection.]
We here describe a female from Philadelphia, Pa., taken August 22, 1898, as this city was probably the exact locality at which the type was captured.
Size large for the genus, form compact; head rather large, full and rounded, about as wide as the pronotum.
Maxillary palpi with penultimate joint about half as long as terminal joint, the latter expanding very gently distad, gently obliquely truncate.
Eyes broad-ovate, moderately protruding.
Pronotum with length contained about one and four-tenths times in greatest (caudal) dorsal width, narrowing slightly in the cephalic portion.
Tegmina nearly as long as the caudal femora, apex of same dorsal in position, distal margin of dorsal field rotundato-rectangulate, longitudinal veins rather conspicuous, cross-veinlets faint.
Wings very long, twice as long as tegmina.
Supra-anal plate very short and strongly transverse, sharply and suddenly depressed mesad, the caudal margin almost straight but slightly produced mesad, separated by a pronounced transverse fold from the supra-anal plate, which plate is shield-shaped.
Cerci long, evenly tapering, thickly covered with hairs.
Ovipositor very long, longer than caudal femora, rigid, with a scarcely perceptible arcuation, apex of same very narrowly sublanceolate enlarged with that portion formed by the dorsal valves armed, the upper margin dentate, these teeth regular, heavy, sharply cut, but with their immediate apices blunt.
Subgenital plate scoop-shaped, rectangulate-emarginate mesad with Fig.

Ovipositor.
(Greatly magnified.)
the margins broadly rounded.-^ Caudal femora with greatest (meso-cephalic) width contained about three times in length.
A male bearing the same data as the female here described affords the additional characters given below.
Size very slightly smaller, proportions much as in female.
The tegmina are translucent and when in repose the dorsal fields are hemi-elliptical in outline.
Subgenital plate scoop-shaped, narrowing evenly but considerably caudad.
The proximo-internal spine of the caudal tibia specialized as described under Morphological Notes in the generic discussion of the present paper.
The brachypterous form of the present species differs in having the apex of the female tegmina at the humeral angle, the distal margin of the dorsal field roundly obhque, arcuato-truncate, while the sutural margin passes into the distal margin without angulation.
2^ In the present species the shape of the subgenital plate of the female varies from the present type to one similar to that of maculatus.

The lower dotted line separates the majority of specimens of N. fasciatus socius (on the left) from the majority of specimens of A^.
fasciatus (on the right).
The diagonal line indicates the squares in which the length of the ovipositor is equal to that of the caudal femur.
From the table on page 413 the relative measurements of the ovipositor and caudal femur of fasciatus and its geographic races are shown to be of use as a character, though exceedingly variable.
Typical fasciatus has the ovipositor usually considerably 25 These specimens are examples of the largest macropterous form of the present species, from which form the type was unquestionably described as De Geer's figure shows.
26 These specimens are among the largest of the series of brachypterous specimens which we have before us. "
These are among the smallest of the series of specimens which we have before us from the New England States.
2s The specimens from Nova Scotia are typical of the species over the extreme northeastern portion of its range.

The southern geographic race, fasciatus socius, has the ovipositor as short as or shorter than the caudal femur with scarcely an exception, while the northern prairie race, fasciatus abortivus, is distinguished from fasciatus by the usually shorter and differently shaped ovipositor and almost invariably shorter caudal femur.
The letters indicating the distribution of fasciatus socius are S to c, while those of fasciatus abortivus are A to D. Color Notes.
— The specimens here described are typical in coloration of the majority of specimens of the species found about Philadelphia.
General color of head and pronotum clove brown shading to very dark mummy brown on the abdomen, limbs, and exposed portions of the wings.
Head with occiput very obscurely striped with four longitudinal lines which are very slightly lighter than the rest of the occiput, eyes very dark mummy brown.
Maxillary palpi mummy brown, the terminal segment darker.
Tegmina of male translucent mummy brown, in the almost transparent portions shading to burnt umber, discoidal vein ivory white, this marking being so narrow as to be inconspicuous; of female prouts brown, the longitudinal veins Vandyke brown and the proximal portion of the intermediate channel Vandyke brown.
The postocular portion of the gense and ventral margin of the lateral lobes of the pronotum are yellowish, these ye,llowish markings very obscure.
Ovipositor very dark Vandyke brown.
A few individuals from the same region are to be found of lighter coloration and in these the color pattern of the species is much more pronounced.
In such the dorsal portion of the head, the eyes, and dorsum of the pronotum are prouts brown, the occipital stripes are distinct, while the interantennal protuberance is pale burnt umber shading to russet on the mouth parts.
The last joint of the maxillary palpi is russet in these specimens for the proximal third, shading in the remaining portion to very dark brown.
The upper portion of the lateral lobes of the pronotum is very dark brown, while the ventral margin of the same is prouts brown.
The limbs and ventral surface of the abdomen are russet.
This russet shade is frequently found to extend to the dorsal surface of the abdomen in such specimens of light coloration, when this is not the case that portion of the abdomen is clove brown.
Interesting differences in coloration of series of the present species are found over its entire range of distribution, the more important of which are here considered.
A series of large pale individuals from Dallas, Tex., is before us, upon which Scudder based his N. canus; these specimens belong to the race fasciatus socius, while specimens from places in the region where fasciatus and fasciatus socius apparently intergrade, Raleigh, N. C, and Crawford County, Ind., are of the same light coloration but somewhat more slender.
Specimens oi fasciatus proper from Long Island, N. Y., and Falls Church, Va., are equally pale, being russet in general coloration, but none are as robust as the individuals from Dallas, Tex.
In all of these specimens as well as in a somewhat darker but very brilliantly colored series from Thompson's Mills, Ga., the males have the coloration of the discoidal vein more pronounced, while the area between this and the free veins of the lateral field is seal brown proximad and of that coloration to the end of the tegmen between the discoidal and mediastine veins.
It is interesting to note that in such pale specimens of the present species as well as in those of very dark coloration the longitudinal stripes of the occiput are absent, while these stripes become more and more pronounced between the extremes of light and dark coloration until in the absolute intermediates-^ they are usually well defined.
Very dark individuals of fasciatus proper are to be found in almost every series, but this is much more pronounced in individuals from the more northern points of the species' distribution.
In the material before us this is very noticeable in a series from Oxford, Mass., which are for the greater part small in size and very dark.
In these specimens the light portion of the lateral lobes is much reduced and obscured while in the darkest specimens of the series it is absent, the yellowish coloration of the discoidal vein is scarcely perceptible to the naked eye.
The few lighter specimens in this series, however, have the occipital stripes more pronounced than in any other specimens of the species before us.
Every conceivable intergradation between the extremes of the species is to be found in the present series not only in coloration, but also in size and in length of tegmina, wings, caudal femur, and ovipositor.
Distribution.— Typicsd fasciatus is to be found from Prince Edward Island across the Dominion of Canada westward to the prairie region in Manitoba, where its place is occupied by fasciatus abortivus.
South of this countrj^ that geographic race gives place again to 29 The intermediates here referred to are usually few in number, as by far the majority of individuals of the species approach the dark extremes more or less closely.
fasciatus proper in northern North Dakota and Montana, and true fasciatus is to be found as far west as the Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, to the base of the Rockies in Colorado, and a few specimens have been taken at Spring Lake, Utah.
Its southern limits are marked by the fall line in the southeastern United States, and west of the Appalachians it is found as far south as Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and, without doubt, the Panhandle of Texas, to Roswell and Albuquerque, N. Mex.
South of this as far west as the dry country of Texas, fasciatus is supplanted by the geographic race, fasciatus socius.
Biological N'otes.
— The present species is one of the most abundant of the North American Gryllidse and is often found in great numbers over the greater part of its range.
It flourishes not only in grassy uplands, but also in meadows and in the heavy grasses about marshes and swamps.
It is also frequent along the borders of woodlands and is to be met with in open forests where the ground is somewhat grassy.
It is particularly noticeable in areas of lush grasses about damp places in the northernmost portions of its range, where, as has been found in almost all insect life of the north, as numerous species disappear, those remaining and having a more northerly distribution are found in enormous numbers.
The present species does not flourish under arid conditions, but its distribution is often extended into the arid west in many places where river bottoms and other watered spots afford a green vegetation well suited to this insect.
The majority of specimens seen of fasciatus are brachypterous, although at times macropterous individuals appear in countless numbers, and are then conspicuous, particularly about the lights at night.
The writer has seen one flight which occurred in the fall of 1911 at Chestnut Hill, Phila., when, shortly after nightfall, the ground under the arc lights in that portion of Philadelphia swarmed with these crickets, although usually few if any specimens are to be found at that place attracted to light.
The song of the insect is shrill and has been described as "tiiiitiiii-tiiii" or " ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti " by Allard, and as "creeeeeee" or " creee-creee-creee-creee " by Rehn and Hebard.
Piers states that "the stridulation is produced by lifting the wing covers about fortyfive degrees above the abdomen and then shuffling them together, producing a sound resembling the word plee-e-e-e plee-e-e-e plee-e-e-e or cree-e-e-e." Morphological Notes.
— An interesting variation in size is found in the present species.
It appears that the insect decreases in size northward from the centre of its distribution, but that occasional series of unusually small size are sometimes found in the central portion of its range.
These smaller series would seem at first glance to belong to a different species, but close examination fails to disclose valid characters of any sort, which is also true of the occasional light colored specimens which have from time to time been referred to canus.
Synonymy.
— The synonymy of the present species is much involved owing to the fact that it is one of the oldest recognized species of North American Orthoptera as well as one of the most abundant and variable over the greater portion of its range.
In 1775, Fabricius described Acheta hospes from America, this being a synonym based on the macropterous form oi fasciatus.
Harris^°, in 1841, described the brach3^pterous form of the present species as Acheta vittata, which name since that time has been extensively used to designate the brachypterous form of the insect.
Scudder, in 1862, most unfortunately recorded macropterous specimens of the present species as N(emobius) exiguus, confusing Say's Acheta exigua with fasciatus, which former species belongs to the genus Anaxipha.
This mistake was repeated by Glover in 1872, and the introduction of that name in the nomenclature of the genus Nemohius resulted in the greatest confusion in the work of many subsequent authors.
In 1896, Scudder described Nemohius utahensis, the type of which'''' cannot be distinguished from the brachypterous form of fasciatus, while since that time specimens of the present species have been referred by various authors to Nemohius utahensis, canu^-, maculatus, ■cubensis, palustris, and carolinusP Specimens Examined}^ — 641: 273 males, 353 females, and 15 nymphs.
^° In 1835 Harris included in his list of Massachusetts insects Say's manuscript name Acheta servilis based on the macropterous form of fasciatus, but, as there was no accompanying description, that name falls as a nomen nudum.
^1 We here select as single type a female specimen, taken at Spring Lake, Utah, in July, 1875, and now in the United States National Museum.
^2 See discussion of this name under the Synonymy of Nemohius fasciatus socius.
^^ The only other name probably applicable to the present species is Nemohius marginata of Murtfeldt, published in 1893 without description, hence a nomen nudum.

[Miami, Fla.] This geographic race can be distinguished from typical fasciatus solely by the proportions of the caudal femur and ovipositor; over its entire range there is an increase in the robustness of the caudal femur and in the female a decrease in the length of the ovipositor, which, when compared in length with the caudal femur, is found to be as short as or shorter than that member.
So few exceptions are to be found to this that, in spite of the close affinity of these southern individuals to fasciatus in all other respects, they should certainly be considered to belong to a definite geographic race.
Type: 9 ; Georgia.
[Scudder Collection.]
Description of Type.
— Agrees perfectly with typical fasciatus, except that the caudal femora are proportionately longer and heavier and the ovipositor shorter, in consequence the length of the caudal femur is equal to that of the ovipositor.
Males from the same State as the type do not differ from males of fasciatus except in their more robust caudal femora, and so great is the size variation in the species that, with no other than this differen1913.
423 tial character, scattered males unaccompanied by females of this southern geographic race are scarcely separable from those of true fasciatus.

The majority of specimens before us from Raleigh, N. C, are of average size, but the series contains some of the smallest specimens of fasciatus socius before us, and the measurements of these are given above to show that extreme of the race.
Color Notes.
— Specimens from the south Atlantic and Gulf coasts which were taken in damp or marshy situations are without exception very dark brown in coloration.
Those from the undergrowth of the pine woods in the south Atlantic States are frequently cinnamon or russet in general coloration, while some of the males taken under such conditions have the markings of typical fasciatus very conspicuous.
Individuals taken at various places in the semi-dry interior of Texas are quite as pale as these, but are not so tawny and the males do not have the darker markings so well defined and conspicuous.
As in fasciatus, the occipital bars are absent in all very light or very dark specimens while most conspicuous in those which are slightly lighter than the average.
Distribution.
— This geographic race is found over the southeastern United States, the northern limit of distribution being defined by the fall line.
West of the Appalachians it is found from the Gulf of Mexico northward to Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.
These northern limits marking the line of intergradation into typical fasciatus.
The most western localities at which fasciatus socius has been taken are Victoria, Sarita, and Brownsville, Tex., and Mexico City.
Biological Notes.
— Though often found in large numbers, this geographic race is seldom met with in the myriads in which true fasciatus is so frequently found.
In southern Georgia and along the Gulf coast the insect is to be found adult at all seasons except during the coldest portions of January, February, and ]March, while in southern Florida it is found mature throughout the entire year.
The series before us indicates that more macropterous individuals are met with in this geographic race than in typical fasciatus.
Morphological Notes.
— The variability of the present species is nowhere more striking than in series of fasciatus socius from various localities.
Very light individuals are to be found and others with heads or tegmina of unusual size and shape.
The specimens from Dallas, Tex., upon which Scudder based N. canus, are very pale, though but little tinged with russet, and have abnormally large heads.
There are many specimens before us which show the unquestionable intergradation from the various series to typical /ascmhis socius and also from one series to the other.
Synonymy.
— In 1896 Scudder described Nemohius canus from a series of six males and ten females of which we here select a male from Dallas, Tex.
(Boll.)
[Scudder Collection], as the type.
We unhesitatingly place this species in the synonymy under fasciatiis socius, from which geographic race it can in no way be separated ; the specimens upon which it was based, including the type here selected, are large and rather pale individuals of fasciatus socius.
In his original description Scudder states that it is possibly only a geographic race of fasciatus, remarkable for its cinereous aspect and the striped appearance of the female tegmina.
The series before us show that the cinereous aspect is found in pale specimens of both fasciatus and fasciatus socius in varying degrees over their entire range, and the different appearance of the tegmina is solely due to the fact that in light specimens of the present species the dark markings are often conspicuous.
In the same paper in which Scudder described A^ canus, he also described N .
aterrimus.
This is a most unfortunate result of carelessness, for the unique male, which we here select as the type of aterrimus, is a medium-sized, dark, brachypterous specimen of fasciatus socius, while the unique female belongs to N. cuhensis.
A thoroughly brief and unsatisfactory description based on two specimens of different species can hardly have been expected to do other than mislead when opportunity was lacking to examine the types.
Saussure, in 1897, described Nemohius hastatus, basing that species on a single female from Mexico City.^^ Careful examination of this tjTJe proves it to be a synonym of the present geographic race of fasciatus.
The specimen is of exceptionally small size, but Saussure's error was caused by his misconception of De Geer's fasciatus in the same paper, for the specimens which he there regards as that species belong in fact to the very different hrasilieyisis of Walker, and consequently he looked upon the specimen under consideration as new.

(Single type fixation.)
Individuals of the present geographic race of N. fas&iatus are found to differ from typical specimens of the species in their much smaller size, very dark coloration, extreme abbreviation of the tegmina, and, in the female, by differences in the ovipositor, the apex of which is fully as much enlarged but for a less di.stance than in fasciatus, being more obliquely subtruncate, and is provided with more pronounced teeth.
38 All belong to the type series of the synonymous Neynobius cayius Scudder, 1th the exception of the macropterous specimen, which is labelled .V.
socius by with the exception of the macropterous Scudder.
Though resembhng N. maculatus closely in size and somewhat in form, individuals of this race may be separated by the absence of light markings on the head, immaculate and dark coloration, less sharply truncate tegmina in both sexes, more shiny appearance in the males, and different apex of the ovipositor in the females.

Description of Type.
— Size smallest of the races of fasciatus, similar to A'', maculatus in size, but form not quite so robust.
Head, eyes, and pronotum as in fasciatus.
Tegmina not as long as the caudal femur, translucent and rather abruptly rounded distad, though not as sharply truncate as in typical maculatus.
Wings absent.
Abdominal appendages and first proximal internal spine of caudal tibiae as in fasciatus.
Limbs as in fasciatus.
Allotypic 9 , here selected, bears the same data as the type.
Description of Allotype.
— Size larger, but proportions much as in the type.
Tegmina much shorter than the caudal femur, broadly rounded distad, though not as much so as in typical maculatus, longitudinal veins rather conspicuous, cross veinlets faint.
Wings absent.
Ovipositor long, longer than caudal femur, rigid, with a scarcely perceptible arcuation, apex of same sublanceolate, enlarged for a shorter distance than in fasciatus and more obliquely subtruncate than in that species, with that portion formed by the dorsal valves armed, the upper margin dentate, these teeth rather irregular, heavy, and sharply cut.

5) Greatest width of caudal femur 1.8 1.7 1.9(1.8-2.1) 1.8(1.7-1.9) Length of ovipositor 6.2 6.8(6.2-7.4) The above measurements show that when compared with the smallest individuals of fasciatus, the length of the caudal femur of this race averages considerably less, while the length of the ovipositor is also less in the majority of cases.
The small dark form of fasciatus fomid in eastern Ontario and Michigan, of which Walker speaks,^^ is, as he has stated, but a degenerate and does not, as Caudell has supposed,^"^ belong to the present geographic race.
From this it may be separated by the general coloration, which although dark, is not as nearly black as in fasciatus abortivus, and the ovipositor which is exactly as in fasciatus.
Intermediates between such individuals and fasciatus abortivus will undoubtedly be found frequently in the area of intergradation between fasciatus and the present geographic race.
The individuals from Aweme, Man., before us, do not show the characters which define the geographic race as distinctly as do the specimens from the type locality, all of the other specimens here treated are typical.
Color Notes.
— The males of the present geographic race appear to be shiny black to the naked eye, but under a Zeiss binocular are found to lie shiny dark clove brown in general coloration.
The maxillary palpi are darker than in typical fasciatus.
The yellow line of the discoidal vein of the males is extremely narrow, and the yellowish markings of the postocular portion of the genae and ventral margin of the lateral lobes are absent or very greatly reduced and obscured in both sexes.
The tegmina of the females have the dorsal field sepia in general color with the longitudinal veins tinged with tawny and the median vein distinctly outlined in clove brown, which is also the color of the entire lateral field with the exception of the intermediate channel which is of the same color as the dorsal field.
Several of the females of fasciatus abortivus before us have a general coloration which is somewhat less dark, and in these specimens the dorsal surface of the insect approaches sepia with a faint tawny cast and in one or two individuals the pale stripes of the occiput are faintly indicated.
Distribution.
— This geographic race is found over the prairie region of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta in the Dominion of Canada, and in the adjacent portions of the United States.
It has also been taken as far east as Fort William, in extreme western Ontario.
Biological Notes.
— Caudell has found this race plentiful in the grass along the borders of a draw on the prairie at IMoose Jaw, Sask., while Walker states that it is common everywhere on the prairies of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.

[Raleigh and Jefferson, N. C] The long straight ovipositor of the present species having the dorsal margin of its apex obliquely subtruncate and armed with teeth places it at once in the first of the North American subgenera, Allonemobius, of which fasciatus is the type.
From typical N. fasciatus it is possible to distinguish maculatus by its smaller size and more compact structure, the different markings on the head and maxillary palpi and more mottled general color pattern, the short tegmina which are more quadrate in the male and more nearly squarely truncate in the female, and the shorter more rigid ovipositor which is armed with very sharp teeth.
From N. griseus it may be distinguished by all the characters which separate that species from all other species of the subgenus.
A general superficial resemblance to N. amhitiosus is noticeable, but examination at once reveals the many differential characters of that aberrant species.
Described from one male and nine females from two localities.
Single type here designated: 9 ; Marion County, Indiana, in low open woods.

Color Notes.
— The specimens here described are typical in coloration of the great majority of specimens of the species before us.
General color bistre with a tawny suffusion, the dorsum of the pronotum dotted, and the caudal limbs mottled with darker brown.
Head with a narrow pale yellowish line about the eyes except on the infra-ocular portion of the gense, a medio-longitudinal line of the same color faintly indicated on the occiput.
Maxillary palpi, of male with proximal portion of penultimate segment pale, of female with penultimate segment and proximal portion of terminal segment russet.
"*^ Lateral lobes of pronotum broadly barred with clove brown, the immediate ventral margin of the general coloration of the insect.
Tegmina with dorsal field of male translucent bistre, with discoidal vein narrowly outlined in ivory white; dorsal field of female bistre with a tawny suffusion, the median vein pale yellowish; lateral field in both sexes clove brown.
Ovipositor very dark Vandyke brown.
As has been noted, the males are usually darker than the females and in consequence have the abdomen wholly clove brown, while in the females this portion of the body is usually bistre, more or less suffused with tawny.
In a few of the specimens of darkest coloration the light markings on the head are, as would be expected, considerably obscured.
Distribution.
— The present species is distributed over the Upper Austral Zone of the eastern United States and has been taken from Flatbush, L. I., N. Y., southward through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, as far as Raleigh, N. C, and westward through Ohio and Indiana to Illinois.
Biological Notes.
— This is a secretive species which is almost always found among leaves and about logs in woods, particularly in damp situations.
In such places colonies of considerable size are sometimes to be found, but unless special effort is made to locate these, the little insects in most cases wholly escape the notice of the collector.
This is one of the species of Nemobius in which the reduction of the tegmina has reached an advanced stage, and we are consequently not surprised to find no macropterous individuals in the series of specimens before us.
Synonymy.
— No synonyms of the present species have been erected.
Specimens of the diminutive and peculiarly colored type of fasciatus discussed under that species have been referred by Walker on Scudder's identification, and bj^ Rehn and Hebard to the present species.

■»3 This difference of coloration is due to the fact that the female is lighter than the male, this is usually the case in the present species.
The series before us indicates that, in maculatus as in fasciatus, the lightest portion of the maxillary palpi is the proximal portion of the penultimate segment.
In pale specimens the light coloration extends from the apex of the segment which precedes the penultimate to the base of the terminal segment.

(Description.)
[College Station, Tex.]
The present interesting insect is very different from any of the other species found in Texas, but, although known from the unique type only, comparisons with the type and other specimens of Walker's N. griseus show without question that it is a geographic race of that species differing only in the darker coloration, more obscure color pattern and much shorter ovipositor.
Material from the country which intervenes between the type locality and the range of typical griseus will doubtless show intermediates much as those found between N.fasciatus and its southern race N.fasciatus sociiis, although in the present race the differentiation appears to have reached a more advanced degree.

This trim insect may be immediately distinguished from all other North American species of the genus by the very strilving marlvings of the head and the usually distinctly striped caudal femora.
Moreover, in the males, the evenness of the dorsal field of the tegmina, which is bounded by a pale narrow line not only laterad, but caudad as well, gives this sex a very clean-cut appearance, while the scarcely Figs.

Although a small amount of variation exists in size, proportions, and tone of general coloration, the peculiarly striking color pattern is constant in the present species.
Described from a series of eleven specimens from a single locality.
Single type here designated: 9 ; Fort Reed, Florida.

[Scudder Collection.]
We here describe a female from Gainesville, Fla., taken August 16, 1905, in the undergrowth of the pine woods by Rehn and Hebard.
29 Size medium for the genus, form robust; head rather large and rounded, but considerably flattened in front.
Maxillary palpi much as in N. griseus, but with the penultimate segment much more decidedly constricted in the proximal portion.
Eyes broad-ovate, not at all protruding.
Pronotum as in griseus.
Tegmina less than half as long as caudal femora, apex at humeral angle very broadly and roundly obtuse-angulate, distal margin of dorsal field oblique, passing into the sutural margin arcuately without angulation, the intermediate channel not conspicuous and forming part of the dorsal field, longitudinal veins very heavy and straight, cross-veinlets numerous but very faint.
Wings absent.
Ovipositor slightly longer than the caudal femora,'*'^ rigidly straight, apex of same scarcely enlarged, dorsal margin of apex armed with an even series of heavy, sharp teeth.
Subgenital plate scoop-shaped, shorter than in N. fasciatus, with caudal margin straight.
Caudal femora with greatest width (meso-cephalic) contained less than three times in the length.
Spines of caudal tibiae stiff, covered with very short hairs, margins very finely serrate; caudal metatarsus furnished on dorsal and ventral margins with unusually heavy bristles.

2.1 2.2 2.4 Length of ovipositor 4.8 6.1 Although the variation in size and proportions is well demonstrated by the above measurements, we find the species to vary but little in its distinctive color pattern and tegminal structure.
Over the distribution of ambitiosus there is no gradual increase or decrease in size, local conditions governing such variation ; this is shown by the extremes given for the series from Gainesville, Fla., which series averages rather large, but contains not only the largest, but also the smallest specimens before us.
Color Notes.
— The general coloration ranges from cinnamon to clove brown tinged with tawnj^, frequently more or less flecked with a darker shade and occasionally with grayish, which gives to certain females a rather' close superficial resemblance to N. maculatus.
Both extremes are represented by numerous specimens in the series before us, those of cinnamon coloration having in ahnost every case been taken in the undergrowth of the pine woods.
The coloration of the specimens here described is as follows.
Occiput and vertex mars brown; face shining piceous, sharply delineated from the vertex by a paler edging of the latter and crossed by a very striking but narrow supra-ocellar band; post-ocular region pale russet.
Maxillary palpi with proximal segments cinnamon, terminal segment dark, shading abruptly from cinnamon to clove brown in the proximal fifth.
Pronotum mars brown with ventro-caudal angle of lateral lobes clove brown, the immediate margin at this point very pale.
Dorsal surfaces of limbs russet, flecked with darker brown; external face of caudal femora, however, strikingly marked with two narrow longitudinal bands of clove brown tinged with tawny.
Tegmina of male shining piceous, discoidal vein cream color, which coloration is continued as a narrow distal border to both dorsal and lateral fields, thereby giving the insect a very trim appearance; of female shining piceous, the intermediate channel buffy.
Dorsal surface of abdomen of male clove brown tinged with tawny; of female mars brown, that portion hidden by the tegmina piceous in both sexes.
In both sexes the ventral surface of the body and limbs is cinnamon.
A number of females before us have the entire dorsal fields of the tegmina of the same paler coloration as the intermediate channel and in such specimens this surface is usually flecked with darker brown.
Some specimens have the lateral lobes of the pronotum unicolorous, dark or light brown, and the pale coloration of the margin of the ventro-caudal angle is often much reduced or entirely absent.
In a very few of the palest colored specimens the striking markings of the external faces of the caudal tibiae are absent.
The striking cephalic markings are always distinct and are an excellent specific character.
Distrihution.
— The present species is known to range from Florence, South Carolina, and Gwinnett County in northern Georgia, southward over that State and throughout the mainland of Florida.
Biological Notes.
— Allard states that the present species is the first to appear at Thompson's Mills in north Georgia, and describes its song as a very brief, high-pitched, and shrill "tiiiiiiii-tiiiiii-tiiiiiiiiitiiiiiiii."
He further remarks, ''It is one of the commonest species of Nemobius in this vicinity and begins to stridulate as soon as spring opens in March and April.
In April, 1910, very cold periods of weather with considerable sleet and snow completely silenced these hardy crickets.
Notwithstanding this inclement weather, these crickets were always in active stridulation as soon as the days became warmer."
The present author has often noticed the same hardiness of this species at Thomasville, Ga., during the winter months, and from there southward the insects are found adult throughout the year.
It seems singular that a species showing such hardy habits is so limited in northward distribution.
It is our opinion that no macropterous form of the present species exists.

Subgenus BRACHYNEMOBIUS n. subgen.
The subgenus is monotypic.
Type of subgenus — Nemohius panteli n. sp.
Subgeneric Description.
— Size large for genus.
Disto-ventral spurs of caudal tibia very unequal in length.
Proximo-internal spine of caudal tibia in male specialized as described under Morphological Notes for the genus; other spines short and heavy, below concave, with margins of this sulcation minutely serrulate in both sexes, the disto-internal spine not specialized.
Ovipositor moderately long, nearly rigidly straight ; apex with the margin of that portion formed by the dorsal valves straight and armed with serrulations, the portion formed by the ventral valves unarmed.
The present subgenus finds its nearest relationship in the North American subgenera to Allonemohius, from which it differs in the shorter heavier spines of the caudal tibiae, the ovipositor which has the apex with that portion formed by the dorsal valves not obliqueljsubtruncate or armed with teeth and a more robust general appearance.

[Mescico, Mex.]
This species appears to be related more nearly to Nemobius fasciatus socius than to any of the other North American species of the genus.
It differs distinctly from that species in the characters given in separating the present subgenus from the subgenus Allonemohius as well as in certain important characters of color pattern.
A certain relationship is shown to Nemobius brasiliensis in the characters of the apex of the ovipositor, but in other respects these species differ very widely.

— General coloration of head, pronotum, tegmina, and abdomen clove brown; the dorso-caudal jDortion of the occiput is russet, this marking extending on the sides of the head as a narrow line which borders the caudal margin of the eyes, the remaining post-ocular portion of the gense being of the darker general coloration.
In front of the paler marking of the occiput there is an indication of four very narrow and faint longitudinal lines of this color and the dorsum of the pronotum is also minutely dotted with russet.
In the female the intermediate channel of the tegmina is broccoli brown, in the male wood brown.
The limbs are bistre in the female, drab in the male.
Ovipositor dark burnt umber.
The specimen from Costa Rica was taken when it had recently reached the adult condition ; this specimen shows scarcely any cephalic markings.
Distribution.
— The present species is known only from ^Mescico, Mex., and San Jose, Costa Rica.
Synonymy.
— It is surprising that Scudder, in 1896, considered his specimens of this aberrant species to be the same as the very different Nemohius cuhensis mormonius, which insect he then erroneously believed to be Nemohius mexicanus Walker.

Subgenus ARGIZALA Walker.
The subgenus is monotypic.
Type of subgenus — Nemohius hrasiliensis [Argizala hrasiliensis] (Walker).
Suhgeneric Description.
— Size very large for the genus.
Pronotum with width almost twice the length, much more transverse than in the other North American subgenera.
Disto-ventral spurs of caudal tibia very unequal in length.
Proximal-internal spine of caudal tibia in male specialized as described under Morphological Notes for the genus; other spines very long, below concave, with margins of this sulcation minutely serrulate in both sexes, the disto-internal spine not specialized.
Ovipositor long, nearly rigidly straight; apex with the margin of that portion armed by the dorsal valves straight and armed with serrulations, the portion formed by the ventral valves unarmed.
The glossiness of the only known North American species of this subgenus is very striking.
The present subgenus finds its nearest relationship in the North American subgenera to Allonemobius and Brachynemobius.
In form it is perhaps somewhat nearer the former, while the shape and armament of the apex of the ovipositor is similar to that found in the latter subgenus.

major, by its very large size, peculiar color pattern and glossiness, and ovipositor with the straight dorsal margin of the apex armed with serrulations.
Without being able to examine the type of major, we do not feel warranted in considering it a brachypterous individual of the .present species.
Saussure's description shows major to be very closely allied to brasiliensis, differing from it in the less transverse pronotum, with bands on either side of the same, and the longer ovipositor.
Based on two females from Brazil.

1913.1 447 We here describe a female taken at Medellin, Vera Cruz, Mex., in September, 1895, and in the Hebard Collection.
Size very large for the genus; form compact; head rather large and rounded but a little flattened in front.
Maxillary palpi of much the same form as in N. fasdatus.
Pronotum extremely transverse with length contained nearly twice in greatest (caudal) dorsal width, narrowing evenly and considerably cephalad and with a slight medio-longitudinal sulcus in the cephalic portion.
Tegmina nearly as long as the caudal femora, apex of the same dorsal in position, distal margin of dorsal field rotundato-acute-angulate, longitudinal veins conspicuous, cross-veinlets numerous and heavy, faint cross-veinlets are also present in the intermediate channel and traces of such are to be found even between the veins of the lateral fields.
Wings very long, considerably more than twice as long as the tegmina.
Ovipositor long though shorter than the caudal femur, rigid, straight, apex of same very narrowly sublanceolate, with the margin of that portion formed by the FtiJ" l^oT^a^v ?e w'of ensts.

very pale glossy tawny-olive, the underparts somewhat paler.
Head of general coloration, the occiput distinctly striped with three longitudinal lines of mummy brown, eyes bistre.
Maxillary palpi covered with short dark hairs, of general coloration with the exception of the extreme apex of the terminal segment which is bistre.
Pronotum of general coloration with a large meso-dorsal maculation of mummy brown, the caudo-lateral portions of this maculation are of somewhat darker coloration and remain as two dark dots in the palest specimens in which the dark markings are very much reduced.
In the palest specimens the tegmina and wings are of the general coloration, with the exception of a very small dark area at the discoido-anal root basin of the tegmina which in the darker specimens is greatly expanded and the entire exposed portions of the tegmina and wings are suffused with mummy brown; intermediate channel very slightly paler than lateral fields of tegmina.
Ovipositor russet, the apex burnt umber.
The glossy and characteristic coloration combined with the large size and certain different proportions give the present insect a very distinctive appearance.
Distrihution.
— Though known from few specimens, the present species has the widest distribution of anj^ American species of the genus, being found from the state of Vera Cruz in Mexico southward through Nicaragua and Brazil to Paraguay and westward to the province of Atacama in Chile.
Biological Notes.
— No brachj-pterous specimens of the present species are known.
Synonymy.
— Scudder, in 1896, described Nemohius melleus from a single specimen from San Rafael, Vera Cruz, Mex., apparently omitting comparison with or reference to the South American species of the genus.
We here place this species in the s>Tionymy under hrasiliensis, for after careful examination of the types of the two species we find that no differential characters exist.

The species Nemohius tollecus shows all of these aberrations to an even greater degree.
Both of these species are considerably more robust than the other species of the present subgenus.

This striking species has a decided superficial resemblance to the Old World N. sylveshis, from which species it differs in being a little smaller and in having the ovipositor curved and armed and the tegmina not obliquely truncate.
From the North American species it may be separated readily by its color pattern combined with the characters of the ovipositor which is considerably heavier and more curved than in any of these.

Biological Notes.
— All of the known specimens of the present species are brachypterous.
Synonymy.— In 1869, Walker very inadequately described N. mexicanus from Oaxaca, Mex., which species Saussure, in 1874, synonymized with his A^.
toltecus (described in 1859 from Mexico, probably Oaxaca).
Scudder, however, in 1896, resurrected mexicanus without having examined the type, and the specimens so recorded at that time were so quoted in the Biologia by Saussure the following year, without doubt because Scudder's recent revision of the North American species of Nemohius should have indicated that his knowledge of the North American members of the genus was superior to that of others.
It is the opinion of the present author that Saussure was entirely correct in synonymizing mexicanus with his toltecus, and in the present paper the opinion which he held in 1874 is followed.
We have not been able to find the type of mexicanus Walker, but we have before us the series of specimens which Scudder considered mexicanus, and it is our opinion that these do not fit Walker's original description, but that that description agrees much better with the description .and the specimen examined of toltecus.
We are further strengthened in this opinion by the series of Nemohius which Scudder considered toltecus in the same paper of 1896, but which in fact belong to the very different N. carolinus neomexicanus, which series is now before us.

[Dale's Pond, Wichita, Kan.] This species is related to N. toltecus in the shape and armament of the ovipositor, but differs in being smaller, of very different color pattern and having a much less heavy ovipositor.
It may be readily separated from all other North American species by its head markings and peculiar color pattern which gives it a dotted and speckled appearance, and also by the characters of the ovipositor.
The insect is in no way nearly related to any other species of Nemobius found north of the Rio Grande, but some of the more mottled specimens of N. cube7isis mormonius from Texas bear it a certain amount of superficial resemblance.

We have noted this peculiarity to be very rare in other species of Nemobius, and in all cases the irregularity of its proportions and the distorted appearance of the apices of the valves prove it to be an abnormality.
It is quite probable that peculiarities in the oviposition of the insects has brought about this result, and a study of these habits in this and other species should prove most interesting.

Color Notes.
— The coloration of the specimens here described is typical of the series before us, the only variation shown being a small amount of intensification or diminution of the color pattern in a few specimens.
General coloration clay color mottled and flecked with mummy brown.
Head below and including the interantennal space shining Vandyke brown, above cinnamon more or less maculate with mummy brown above the interantennal space and on the base of the occiput, the broad occipital bar of cinnamon thus formed usually rather conspicuous, eyes dark bistre.
Maxillary palpi clay color, the distal portion of the terminal segment mummy brown.
Pronotum clay color, more or less mottled and flecked with mummy brown, this mottling often heavy in the median portion of the dorsum, and particularly so on the lateral lobes.
Tegmina of male sepia, discoidal vein cream color but usually very inconspicuous, discoido-anal rootbasin and upper portion of lateral field bistre; of female bistre, with veins and intermediate channel clay color.
Dorsal surface of abdomen of male (concealed by tegmina) clove brown; of female cephahc portion (concealed by tegmina) clove brown, exposed portion clay color more or less maculate with clove brown.
Ovipositor burnt umber.
Ventral surface of body clay color.
Limbs clay color tinged with russet and more or less mottled and flecked with prouts brown.
The specimens from Wichita, Kan., differ from the rest of the series in having the lower portion of the head cinnamon instead of Vandyke brown, and the intermediate channel of the female tegmina is more decidedly defined in the paler color than in the other specimens.
In every other respect, however, these specimens are typical.
Distribution.
— The present species is known from the vicinity of the District of Columbia, west-central Indiana, northeastern Nebraska, and northeastern and south-central Kansas.
Biological Notes.
— No macropterous specimens of this insect are known.
Synonymy.
— The history of the present species is a succession of unfortunate occurrences.
In 1885, Bruner recorded specimens of Nemobius sp.
from Topeka, Kan., which belong to this species; later, in 1893, he drew up a description of the species which was never published, hence his Cyrtoxyphus ?
variegatus Bruner (Mss.
), an unidentifiable ijame from the literature, but the material before us from the Bruner Collection shows it to be this species.
Before 1897, Blatchley sent a series of Indiana specimens of Nemobius to Scudder for determination, and the present species was inexcusably identified for him as N. carolinus Scudder, hence his subsequent misconception of that species, and Caudell upon seeing specimens of Blatchley's material so labelled followed him in this error; thus material sent him for determination by Isely was likewise recorded as carolinus.

[Homestead, Fla.] The large series of the present species, which is the type of the subgenus Neonemobius, before us shows that a very close relationship exists to N. palustris.
although typical N. cubensis looks very different from that species, being larger, of less dark and solid coloration, with tegmina almost always much less abbreviate.
A careful study of the material at hand shows that there are, however, specimens in the series of cubensis which can scarcely be separated from palustris.
These few extreme individuals are as small and of much the same form as palustris, with wings lacking and tegmina quite as abbreviate as in that species.
Almost every one of these specimens, however, is not as solid in coloration, and all but two are more pale in general coloration.
The majority of specimens of cubensis wanting wmgs have the tegmina considerably less abbreviate than in palustris, a number of these having the tegmina quite as well developed as in those specimens having the longest wings.
In summing up the differences between the two species we may add that, in addition to the other differential characters, cubensis usually has the under portions of the body quite pale, much paler than is normal in palustris.
From typical specimens of the western race, A^.
cubensis mormonius, typical individuals of the present species may be readily separated by their less robust build and more solid coloration without the characteristic cephalic and tegminal markings of that race.
In fact, so different are typical specimens of the two that, were it not for the very large series before us which reveals the vast amount of variability found in these insects, we should certainly have considered them distinct species.
Small dark macropterous males of N. fasciatus have been mistaken for this species, but the heavier build and less smooth appearance of that species should always distinguish readily even the most aberrant males from cubensis, while the ovipositor characters of the females show the two species to belong to different subgenera.
Little has apparently been known of the life history of the present species, and it is probably due to the fact that the majority of specimens collected have been taken flying to lights at night that so few brachypterous specimens have been previously recorded.

1.4 2.1 4.1 9.4 4,7 1,7 2,8 It is evident that the variation in the present species and its races is further emphasized by the measurements given above.
It is true that the specimens from Vera Cruz, Mexico, and Castillo, Nicaragua, have in the female sex ovipositors very much shorter than are found in any of the other specimens before us.
These specimens are also different in being the only ones at hand having the lower portion of the head much paler than the upper portion, and the maxillary palpi pale with only the distal portion of the terminal segment very dark.
In other respects these specimens agree almost perfectly with typical ciibensis, and after a careful consideration of the variation in the species, these differences do not warrant considering this material worthy of racial distinction.
Color Notes.
— -The specimens here described agree well with other macropterous specimens of the species before us in the colorationhere given.
General color very dark Vandyke brown, glossj% shading to burnt umber on limbs and tegmina.
Head and pronotum very dark Vandyke brown, immaculate, shining; eyes equally dark.
Maxillary palpi^^ Vandyke brown, the terminal segment very dark.
That portion of the head which fits under the pronotum may be seen to be a very little paler than the other parts of the head when examined closely.
Tegmina translucent, shading from Vandyke brown in the proximal portion to burnt umber on the greater part of both dorsal and lateral fields; intermediate channel very faintly defined in burnt umber.
Dorsal surface of abdomen shining black.
Exposed portion of wings burnt umber, concealed portion very white when folded.
Limbs and ventral surface of insect immaculate, limbs above prouts brown, ventral surface pale^ but varying considerably in depth of coloration.
We have but one large series of brachypterous specimens of cubensis before us, these from Homestead, Fla.,the majority of which specimens are not of as solid coloration and are of somewhat lighter shade than the specimens described above.
In these the penultimate segment of the maxillary palpi is mummy brown, the other segments of the very dark general coloration.
Pronotum a little maculate with mummy brown, tegmina marked with the same color, the intermediate channel quite distinctly defined in the lighter color in several specimens.
Limbs prouts brown, maculate to a slight degree with darker shades.
52 In some very dark specimens before us, the penultimate segment of the maxillary palpi is nearly white, while the other segments are very dark; in a few of the other specimens only the distal portion of the terminal segment is very dark.
Other brachypterous specimens before us are even darker than the normal coloration, being colored very similarly to A^.
palustris, but in almost all cases having much longer tegmina, and in the one or two cases where this is not true they are larger than the largest specimens of that species.
Distribution.
— The present species is known from Staten Island, N. Y., south along the Atlantic coast to the extreme southern portion of the mainland of Florida, and also from Cuba, Vera Cruz in Mexico, Nicaragua and Costa Rica to Brazil.
Its western distribution in the United States appears to be limited bj^ the fall-line.
The records given Ijy Scudder and Blatchley for Illinois and Indiana pertain to other species.
Biological Notes.
— Though seldom numerous, the present insect appears to be always much more plentiful near the sea than elsewhere ; the writer has found it in large numbers but once, in the high grass of the everglades.
Of all the North American species of Nemohius it develops in the macropterous form proportionately the longest tegmina and wings.
The majority of macropterous specimens taken have been captured flying to lights at night ; about such places we have never found this insect anything but very scarce.
Considering the usual extreme development of the tegmina and wings in the present species, it is surprising to find some brachypterous specimens with tegmina quite as much aborted as in A'', palustris.
Synonymy.
— In 1877, Scudder described Nemohius volaticus, which species he himself placed in the synonymy under cubensis in 1896.
We here select a male of that series from Georgia in the Scudder Collection as single type.^^ In Scudder's 1896 paper on the North American species of the genus, he unfortunately created confusion by misidentifying much material, one instance of which was the crediting of specimens of the present species from Lake Worth, Fla., to A^.
carolinus and another in taking a small dark brachypterous female of cubensis as the basis of the description of that sex of his new and doubly invalid A^.
aterrimus.
In 1905, Rehn and Hebard, at a loss to fathom the literature, credited a pair of dark cubensis, having long tegmina but no wings, from Tampa, Fla., to aterrimus.

[Las Vegas, Nev.] The present geographic race varies widely in general appearance, owing probably to the facts that its range includes a great variety of territory, and that as this range includes so much of the semiarid and desert regions of the West, it is found more or less isolated at a great number of localities.
Brachypterous individuals somewhat outnumber the macropterous.
Though the specimens in each respective series from Texas, from Nevada, and from Vera Cruz, Mex., are quite similar, each series has a decidedly distinctive appearance; intermediates between these are, however, always to be found.
The general resemblance to A^.
carolinus neomexicanus is sometimes so very close that, were it not for the fact that in this species the disto-dorsal spurs of the caudal femora are unequal, while in carolinus neomexicanus they are equal, it would be impossible to distinguish some of the males of the two, though the females are readily separable by the very different characters of the ovipositor as well.
So different are individuals from the Texan region, the arid Southwest and southern Mexico, that there is little wonder that several synonyms of the present insect exist, and it would seem advisable to recognize at least three geographic races, were it not for the fact that practically all of the differences are due to coloration, probably caused by the immediate environment and, as would be expected in such a case, every conceivable intergradation is found in the large series before us.
The insect differs from N. cubensis in being less slender, in having Fig.

a different color pattern, and in being more mottled and almost always considerably paler in general coloration.
The color pattern and its variations, consequently important in determining the present insect, is fully treated in the Color Notes.

3.7 Though some amount of variation is shown in each of the series before us, there appears to be little difference in the size and proportions of specimens from the various natural divisions of the range of the present insect.
As has been noticed in other species, macropterous specimens always are found to have the pronotum more widened caudad.
Color Notes.
— The great majority of specimens from Texas are of °' This specimen is the type of A^.
comanchus Saussure.
the type of coloration here described.
General color mummy brown, inconspicuously marbled with sepia and bistre.
Head raw umber, a very narrow line of darker shade extending across the occiput from the caudal margin of the eyes, the remaining caudal portion of the occiput and postocular portion of the gense somewhat paler than the rest of the head.
Eyes prouts brown.
Maxillary palpi raw umber, the distal half of the terminal segment clove brown.
Pronotum mummy brown clouded with bistre, under a Zeiss binocular small dots of wood brown are apparent.
Tegmina translucent; of male with dorsal field a very dark shade of bistre particularly pronounced in the proximal portion, discoidal vein obscurely outlined in cream color, lateral fields clove brown ; of female bistre much suffused with raw umber, the longitudinal veins of the dorsal field, the intermediate channel and ventral margin of lateral fields raw umber, remaining portion of lateral fields clove brown.
Dorsal surface of abdomen of males and macropterous females (concealed beneath tegmina) shining black; of brachypterous females, proximal (concealed) portion of the same color, remaining portion black somewhat maculate with raw umber and covered with hairs of the same color.
Ovipositor Vandyke brown.
Limbs tawny olive slightly mottled with raw umber, the outer face of the caudal femora marked with two faint longitudinal bars of the latter color.
The material before us from the state of Vera Cruz, Mex., resembles these specimens, but the majority are somewhat darker with a more russet suffusion, and the markings which give most of the specimens from Texas a somewhat marbled appearance are considerably reduced.
The distinctive markings of the head are^^, however, in most cases more pronounced.
This type of coloration, as well as intermediates between it and the normal Texan type, is represented by a number of specimens from Texas.
The majority of specimens from Fort Yuma, Cal, and Lower California, are of a very pale desert type of coloration.
So pale are these that the color pattern has in most cases almost disappeared.
General color wood brown, faintly marked with a darker shade.
Head mars brown, a paler caudal portion of the occiput only detectable under the Zeiss binocular.
Disk of pronotum of general color ^ Scudder, in his treatment of the specimens which are now before us, and which he wrongly considered N. mexicanus, gave these color characters very well in his key, "longitudinal markings of head interrupted at the crown, the whole back portion immaculate, sharply defined from the portions in front at the summit, which is feebly subcarinate transversely."
marbled with a darker shade, lateral lobes heavily marked with very dark bistre.
Tegmina mummy brown marked cephalad with dark bistre.
Ovipositor burnt umber.
Limbs and ventral surface of body wood brown tinged with russet, the longitudinal markings on the outer surface of the caudal femora very faintly indicated.
Intermediates between this and the normal Texan type are to be found in specimens from San Jose del Cabo, L.
Cal., Las Vegas, Nev., and Brownsville, Tex.
The typical series from St. George, Utah, all of the Californian specimens except those from Fort Yuma, and almost the entire series from Las Vegas, Nev., belong to a color phase closely resembling that of the specimens from Vera Cruz, excepting that these specimens, are not so much tinged with russet, the usually distinctive cephalic markings are very obscure (practically absent in many cases), while the females have the intermediate channel of the tegmina strikingly cream colored.
Intermediates between this type of coloration and that of the Mexican series are at hand, but in none of the Texan series is a close approach to this to be found.
In all other respects,.
however, the specimens are inseparable and consequently not worthy of even racial distinction.
Distribution.
— The present geographic race is known to range from Biloxi, Miss., to the Pacific coast, and southward as far as the state of Tabasco, Mex.
The most northern localities at which it has been taken are St. George, Utah, Las Vegas, Nev., and the Panamint Valley, Cal.
Biological Notes.
— In the desert regions of the southwestern.
United States this insect is but very occasionally met with in the short grasses growing near streams and other restricted damp areas, but in the semiarid mesquite region of Texas it is widely distributed in the short grasses which are there so frequently encountered; and its range extends still further eastward, where it is found in the typical undergrowth of the long-leaf pine forests.
A few macropterous specimens have been taken at light at Beaumont, Brownsville, and Del Rio, Tex.
; other than at light this long-winged form has scarcely ever been encountered.
Morphological Notes.
— It is the opinion of the author that the considerable amount of variation found in the present insect is due to its frequent isolation together with its very extensive distribution.
Though ranging over all the desert regions of the southwest, this insect, like all other North American Nemobius, is never found unless a certain amount of moisture is present.
In its desert distribution there are consequently often hundreds of square miles utterly unfit for the insect, since it is only found where some dampness is derived from a river or stream, a lake, or some subterranean water supply.
There is little variation in any of the specimens from the heavier portion of the Texan mesquite belt where its range is not discontinuous.
Synonymy.
— When the present geographic race was described in 1896, Scudder wrongly believed a series of specimens of this insect from the state of Vera Cruz, Mex., to belong to the poorly described N. mexicanus of Walker, and he also failed to recognize as such pale specimens of the same from Texas and Lower California which he determined as N. carolinus and A^.
neomexicanus (both belonging to the subgenus Eunemobius, which has the disto-ventral spurs of the caudal tibiae equal and the apex of the ovipositor an.ied above and below).
In 1897, Saussure, supposing Scudder to be correct in his statements, followed him in quoting the records of what Scudder supposed to be mexicanus, but without seeing the material, and so a single specimen of the pale color form of cuhensis mormonius in his possession from Durango or Sinaloa, Mex., was to him apparently new and so described as A'', comanchus.
In the same paper Saussure considered specimens from Tabasco, Mex., to be N. cubensis.
Hart recorded this insect as N. mexicanus in 1906.

This species, the smallest of the North American members of the genus, may be separated from the other North American species of Nemobius belonging to the subgenus Neonemobius by its very small size, slender build, and very dark solid coloration.
The species resembles N. confusus closely in general appearance, but examination quickly shows that species to belong to the subgenus Eunemobius.
The closest affinity is found in N. cubensis, from which species it differs in being smaller in the great majority of cases, of darker and more solid coloration, without tegminal markings of any kind.
In the male the tegmina are almost always less broad, and in the female are usually more abbreviate.

Descriptioji of Type.
— Size very small and form slender for the genus, head small, but full and rounded, wider than the cephalic width of the pronotum.
Maxillary palpi of much the same form as in N.fasciatus, but with segments not as much produced.
Eyes broadovate, not prominent.
Pronotum^^ of much the same proportions as in fasciatus, but of smaller relative size to the rest of the body.
Tegmina very shghtly more than half as long as the caudal femora; apex at humeral angle, very broadly and roundly obtuse-angulate; distal margin of dorsal field very slightly oblique, very broadly arcuato-truncate ; sutural margin passes into distal margin with a distinct but broadly rounded angulation at an angle of slightly more than ninety degrees; intermediate channel notconspicuously depressed and forming part of the dorsal field, this field unusually evenly rounded; longitudinal veins very conspicuous, cross-veinlets very few and extremely obscure.
Wings absent.
Ovipositor about two-thirds as long as caudal femora, distinctly though feebly arcuate; apex of same narrowly sublanceolate, with that portion formed by the dorsal valves armed, the upper margin serrulate, Fig.

Caudal femora with greatest (meso-cephalic) width contained slightl}^ more than three times in the length.
Spines of caudal tibiae considerably more slender than in fasciatus and supplied with fewer hairs.
^^ The series of the present species before us shows that though the majority have the pronotum narrowing very slightly cephalad, some few have the cephalic and caudal width of the same subequal, while in other specimens the pronotum narrows decidedly cephalad.
A male in the Blatchley Collection, bearing the same data as the type, is here selected as the allotype.

Additional material at hand bears out this evidence that the species increases in size very gradually from north to south over its range.
Comparatively little variation IS shown, however, in the present species.
Color Notes.
— The types here described are of the same coloration as the majority of topotypic specimens before us.
The head, pronotum, and limbs are solid Vandyke brown.
Maxillary palpi Vandyke brown with the exception of the terminal joint which is wholly clove brown.
Tegmina and dorsal surface of abdomen dark clove brown.
Ovipositor dark Vandyke brown.
The majority of specimens not from Indiana are, however, somewhat differently colored.
These specimens have the entire dorsal surface of the body dark clove brown, while underneath the usual coloration is raw umber.
In such specmiens the maxillary palpi usually have the third joint a rather light brown, the penultimate joint considerably paler and the terminal joint wholly clove brown.
Both males and females of the present species have a rather shiny appearance.
Distribution.
— The present species has been found on the Atlantic coast from Natick and Dover, Mass., to Wilmington and Lake Waccamaw, N. C, and inland has been taken as far north as Algonquin Park, Ont., and as far west as Starke County, Ind.
It is a swamp and bog inhabiting species, and is consequentlj^ very local in distribution.
Biological Notes.
— The present species is extremely secretive, living in the recesses of swamps and bogs, usually in and about sphagnum mosses.
In such situations palustris may sometimes be found in very large numbers, but the peculiar habitat combined with the small size and sombre coloration of the insects themselves, explains their usual scarcity in collections.
When disturbed, individuals of })alustris leap about vigorouslj^ and then burrow into the sphagnum mosses or hide under roots or debris.
Dr. Walker describes the song of this species as "a continuous and rather feeble trill" and notes a similarity to that of carolimis.
No macropterous specimens of the species have been taken, and it is our opinion that such do not occur, owing to the fact that in the present species the reduction of the tegmina has reached a rather advanced stage and is found to vary to an extremely small degree.
Synonymy.
— No synonyms of the present species have occurred, but AUard has unfortunately recorded small dark specimens of N. fasciatus as this species.
Specimens Examined.
— 56: 28 males, 28 females.

(Single Type fixation.)
Tlie present insect is in all probability a southern race of N. palustris, distinguished only from that species by its peculiar and striking coloration.
Unsuccessful efforts have been made to obtain additional material from the region in which the type series was taken, and until this can be done it is, in our opinion, advisable to consider the present insect a geographic race, although it may eventually prove to be a mere color variety.
Type: d^; Thomasville, Georgia.
In sphagnum.

(Hebard.)
[Hebard Collection.]
Description of Type.
— The head, pronotum, and ventral surface of the insect is ochraceous-rufous, the limbs almost uniform ochraceous, and the tegmina and dorsal portion of the abdomen shining black.
The maxillary palpi are pale yellowish, with the exception of the last segment, which is darker at the base, shading to clove brown in the apical half.
The female allotype, here selected, bears the same data as the type and is in the same collection; it is slightly larger than the type, but of the same coloration.

Biological Notes.
— The series was taken near the town in a small area of moist ground where the pine woods gave way to the magnolias and beeches of the "branch" forest growth.
All of the specimens were captured in sphagnum growing among the roots of these latter trees.
The entire series is brachypterous.

Subgenus EUNEMOBIUS n. subgen.
This distinctive subgenus includes two species and two geographic races from North America.
Type of subgenus — Nemohius carolinus Scudder.
Suhgeneric Description.
— Size medium for the genus.
Disto-ventral spurs of caudal tibia equal in length.
Proximal and distal internal spines of male specialized as described under Morphological Notes for the genus; other spines of caudal tibia below concave, with margins of this sulcation smooth in both sexes.
Ovipositor very short, almost always less than two-thirds the length of the caudal femur, gently curved; apex with dorsal margin armed with heavy teeth, ventral margin armed with minute, widely spaced serrulations.
Ventral segments of abdomen in male broadened, extending outward and upward on sides of abdomen above the normal dorsal segments, thus making the abdomen unusually broad and its entire dorsal surface concave.
The present subgenus is widely separated from the other North American subgenera by the majority of the characters given above.

[Homestead, Fla.] This species, type of the subgenus Eimemobius, is very different from N. confusus, the only other known North American species belonging to that subgenus.
The present insect is almost invariably larger in size, has a more robust structure, less glossy appearance, different color pattern and usually paler coloration; it has also differently colored maxillary palpi and a very different ovipositor in the female.
The coloration of the maxillary palpi is of the greatest value as a certain and ready character for the separation of the two species.
Like N. cubensis, the present species has a widely distributed paler western race, but, unlike that species, the great majority of macropterous individuals are found in the western series.
Based on an unspecified series from North Carolina.
Single type here designated: d^; North Carolina.
[Scudder Collection.]
We here describe a female taken at Lake Waccamaw, N. C, September 8, 1911, by Rehn and Hebard and in the Hebard Collection.
Size medimii, form rather stout, head small but prominent and wider than cephalic width of pronotum, interantennal projection moderate.
Eyes small but prominent, broad-ovate, proportionately broader than in A^ fasciatus, moderately protruding.
Maxillary palpi of much the same form as in that species, but less attenuate.
Pronotum with length contained nearly one and two-fifths times in width, narrowing very slightly cephalad, but more abruptly in cephalic third; with a median impressed line more noticeable in the cephalic portion.
Tegmina^^ very slightly more than half as long as caudal Fig.

femur; longitudinal veins decided, not as conspicuous as in N. confusus, cross-veinlets very faint.
Wings absent.
Ovipositor slightly less than two-thirds the length of the caudal femur, distinctly though feebly arcuate; apex of same narrowly sublanceolate, with both dorsal and ventral margins armed, the former with heavy, rather widely separated teeth, the latter with minute very widely spaced serrulations.
Limbs delicate, spines of caudal tibia?
rather slender.
We here describe a male bearing the same data as the female described above.
Slightly smaller but proportionately broader, particularly in the abdominal portion.
Tegmina transparent and delicate, very broad and completely enveloping all but the ventral surface of the peculiarly broadened abdomen; when in repose the dorsal fields are very flat and hemi-elliptical in outline, the lateral margins slightly bowed, subparallel.
Wings absent.
The ventral segments of the abdomen are extremely broadened and extend outward and upward on the sides of the abdomen above the normal dorsal segments, thus making the abdomen unusually broad and its entire dorsal surface deeply concave.
60 The form of the female tegmina is useless as a character in the present species owing to its variabiUty.
We have before us brachypterous specimens ranging from those which have the distal margins of the dorsal field transverse, to those which have these margins decidedly oblique, the degree of angulation of the tegmina also varying considerably.

Macropterous specimens are exceedingly scarce in the north, almost all of the long-winged specimens before us are from Georgia and Florida.
Color Notes.
— The individuals here described are typical of the majority of the specimens at hand.
Head very dark mummy brown, the faintest kind of longitudinal lineation barely suggested on the caudal portion of the occiput, which portion is slightly paler than the rest of the head.
Eyes very dark brown.
Maxillary palpi cream color, the first three segments and base of the fourth much suffused with very dark brown, terminal segment cream color with the immediate apex very dark brown.
Pronotum very dark mummy brown, shading to almost black on the lateral lobes.
Tegmina of both sexes dark mummy brown, shining, transparent ; intermediate channel of the same color as the other portions.
Limbs raw umber, above very slightly maculate with mummy brown.
Under portions of limbs and body raw umber.
Entire dorsal surface of abdomen of male (concealed) and concealed portion of same in female very dark brown, polished; exposed portion of same in female very dark mummy brown marked with four regular rows of small raw-umber spots.
In the large series of specimens before us there are many somewhat paler or darker than those here described.
In the lighter specimens the dark lateral lobes of the pronotum are usually much more noticeable and the spots on the exposed dorsal surface of the abdomen in the female are more distinct.
The pale color of the maxillary palpi is more yellowish.
The darker specimens are often almost black on the dorsal surface, the ventral surface mummy brown.
The spots on the exposed dorsal surface of the abdomen in the female are greatly reduced or wholly absent.
The pale color of the maxillary palpi is almost always white with no yellowish suffusion.
The markings of the maxillary palpi in this species varies from a type having the apical half of the ultimate joint darkened, to one which bears only a trace of this dark coloration at the extreme apex; this trace of darker coloration is never missing, however, and serves as a character to separate this species from A'', confusus.
Distribution.
— This insect is known from the province of Quebec to the most southern portion of the mainland of Florida, and west to the great plains and the mesquite region of Texas.
Aside from N. fasciatus and its southern race, this species is the most abundant of the genus over almost its entire range.
Only in extreme southern Florida is this not true, where N. cuhensis is the most plentiful of the species of the genus.
The present insect may be found in a great variety of situations; it appears to prefer thick grasses growing along the edges of woodlands, the leaf-covered almost bare ground about streams and ponds in heavy woods, dark swamps, or marsh land under cat-tails.
The song is a high-pitched and continuous trill, more pleasant to the ear than that of N. fasciatus.
The majority of southern macropterous specimens before us were taken when attracted to light at night.
Specimens taken on the border of woodlands and in marshlands are^ as would be expected, usually pale, while those from the other situations mentioned are almost always dark; no other differences of any kind exist between these.
Biologicai Notes.
— We find that the peculiarly developed abdomen of the males of the present species acts as a sounding-board for the tympanum.
The tegmina fit tightly over the raised margins of the concave dorsal surface of the abdomen in this sex, their apex just covering and fitting closely to the distal extremity of the abdomen.
Small, dark macropterous specimens of this species from the southern United States have been recorded as N. cuhensis owing to their great superficial resemblance to that species, which, however, belongs to a different subgenus having very different characters.
Over the greater portion of the range of this species, macropterous individuals are exceedingly scarce.
Synony?ny.
— In 1776, Provancher recorded the present species as Nemohius exiguus.
This was doubtless due to the fact that at that time Scudder had not properly placed Say's Acheta exigua,^^ which species is now known to belong to the genus Anaxipha, for Scudder had used the name Nemohius exiguus to record specimens which he realized later belonged in fact to N. fasciatus.
In 1877, Scudder, described Nemohius volaticus, the males of which are macropterous specimens of N. cuhensis, the females macropterous specimens of N .
carolinus, as an examination of the types clearly shows.
In October of 1877, Provancher corrected his 1876 record, using Nemohius (Anaxipha) septentrionalis, as suggested by Scudder (who did not realize that his own species, described the previous April as Nemohius carolinus, was the same) but without describing the species ; the next month, however, he described the insect under that name.
This name was again used by Caulfield in 1887, and first placed in the synonymy under the present species by E. M. Walker in 1909, though Davis recognized this fact as early as 1896.
In 1890, Smith wrongly used the name Nemohius exiguus in giving Davis' correct record of Anaxipha exigua.^In 1892, Blatchley used the name Nemohius exiguus, and in 1900, considering it a new species, he gave under the same name a full description, but, as he was unable to validate a name based originally " 1825.

^^ Am.
Nat., XXII, p. 1148. by Scudder on a misidentification, this name could not stand even if Blatchley's species were not an absolute synonym of Scudder's N. carolinus, as a comparison of a topotypic series of the former from Blatchley with the type of the latter shows us beyond the slightest doubt.
Blatchley cannot in any way be criticised for believing the species undescribed, for Scudder, having examined specimens for him, identified individuals of Nemohius bruneri (described in the present paper and then known only by the latter from specimens bearing Bruner's invalid name Cyrtoxyphus (?)
variegatus) as Nemohius carolinus, and advised him to describe specimens of true Nemohius carolinus, Scudder's own species, as new.
This great carelessness resulted in Nemohius carolinus being recorded as Nemohius exiguus by Bruner (with a query) in 1893, Lugger in 1898, Blatchley in 1903, Mead in 1904, Isely and Rehn and Hebard in 1905, and Brimley in 1908.
In 1893, Bruner recorded the species as N. volaticus with a query.
In 1894, Beutenmiiller described Nemohius affinis, which species was two years later correctly placed in the synonymy under carolinus by Scudder, but which name was used by Smith in 1900 and 1910.
In 1896 and 1900, Scudder recorded specimens of A^.
cuhensis and N. palustris as the present species, specimens of which latter he also recorded as N. cuhensis.
His discussion of Provancher's "Nemohius {Anaxipha) septentrionalis" in the former paper is incorrect.
Lugger's 1898 record of A^.
socius should probably apply to the present species.
In 1902, E. M. Walker misidentified a large series of the present species from Ontario as N. palustris, and in 1904 believing these records wrong corrected the name to N. confusus.
The same year he described Nemohius angusticollis, placing the specimens from which the above incorrect records were given in the typical series.
This name is an absolute synonym of A^.
carolinus, as was first stated by E. M. Walker himself in 1909.
Rehn and Hebard, in 1905 and 1911, mistook macropterous specimens of this insect for N. cuhensis and so recorded them.
Morse, in 1906, repeated Scudder's incorrect records of 1896 of the present species under A'^.
palustris.
The same year Kirby, realizing Blatchley's name A^.
exiguus invalid, proposed as a new name Nemohius janus; this name was used by Rehn in 1910 and twice by AUard in 1911.
Specimens Examined.

(Single type fixation.)
This insect is known from the types only, which specimens show it to be very near N. carolinus.
From that species this geographic race differs in being very pale in coloration, with the spots on the dorsal surface of the female abdomen greatly enlarged.
The types are also as robust as the largest specimens of carolinus before us, while the ovipositor is very short.
Type: 9; Fort Collins, Colorado.
October 4, 1901.
[Hebard Collection ex Bruner.]
Description of Type.— Size medium, form robust.
Similar to N .
carolinus except in the paler coloration, exaggerated color pattern and in the ovipositor which is short (probably^^ similar to that of JV.
caroUnus neomexicanus in normal specimens).
We here describe the unique allotypic male which bears the same •data as the type.

The present geographic race differs from typical Nemobhis carolinus in being usually of paler coloration over the arid or semiarid portions of its distribution, while in these specimens the great majority are somewhat more slender.
The series from the state of Vera Cruz, Mex,, differs from carolinus in being more russet in general coloration, the dorsal abdominal spots of the females being, moreover, very large.
1913.1 485 In all of these series the ovipositor is almost invariably considerably shorter than in carolinus and consequently shows even less curvature.
Based on a series of five specimens of both sexes from four localities.

3 The considerable variation in the present insect does not seem to be affected by distribution, the extremes of the species before us being found in both series from Brownsville, Tex., and Orizaba, Mex.
The greatest ovipositor length is seen to about equal the minimum found in N. carolinus, though rare exceptions are found in that species where the length of the ovipositor is less than even the average of the present race.
Color Notes.
— We here describe the coloration of the type.
Head, pronotum and tegmina mummy brown shading to raw umber on the limbs and with intermediate channel of tegmina and exposed portions of wings tawny olive.
Under portions of insect pale tawny olive.
Maxillary palpi yellowish, the extreme apex of the terminal segment very narrowly marked with very dark brown.
The majority of the specimens from the arid and semiarid portions of the range of the insect are somewhat darker than the type, the general color being Vandyke brown, and in some of these individuals the occipital markings described under carolinus are faintly apparent.
There are very few brachypterous females from this portion of the distribution of the race, and all of these but one are in a poor state of preservation.
The specimen from Brownsville, Tex., in good condition, shows the color pattern of the exposed dorsal surface of the abdomen similar to that of typical carolinus.
The majority of the specimens from the state of Vera Cruz resemble carolinus closely in coloration and color pattern, but are almost without exception more russet.
The few specimens from that region, which differ from these in coloration, are colored much as in typical carolinus neomexicanus, and all have the ovipositor as is typical in that race.
With scarcely an exception, the limbs of the specimens before us are immaculate.
The maxillary palpi have the dark marking of the apex of the ultimate joint invariably exceedingly narrow.
Distribution.
— The present insect is known from the more arid regions of the western United States, southward to the state of Vera Cruz, Mex., and Costa Rica.
The most northern localities at which it has been taken are Shovel Mountain, Tex., Jemez Hot Springs"^, New Mex., and Florence, Ariz. From Shovel Mountain, Tex., it is found south to the Gulf coast and is checked in its eastern distribution by this boundary.
The most southern locality is Costa Rica, while it appears to be only limited in its western distribution by the Pacific coast.
Biological Notes.
— All we know of the life of the present race has been learned from material taken in the southwestern United States.
There the species appears to enjoy a wide but rather local distribution.
It was very seldom found by us in any numbers, and occasional macropterous specimens attracted to light were the usual indication of the presence of the species.
We have found it but once in the brachypterous form, then .it was not extremely scarce, but very difficult to capture, in low irrigated grass near the station at " These specimens are intermediates between this race and typical N. carolinus.
32 Albuquerque, New Mex.
Occasional trills from this grass plot indicated the presence of the insects in the afternoon, specimens could doubtless have been taken there with ease after nightfall.
The series before us suggests that the species is far more plentiful in the region discussed during June than later in the season.
The same conditions which govern the distribution of .V.
cubensis mormonius are applicable to the present species as well.
Synonymy.
— In 1896, Scudder incorrectly recorded the series of specimens of the present insect from the state of Vera Cruz, Mex., as N. toltecus, in the same paper in which he described neomexicanus.
That year that name was again used by him for the same specimens in his key in Psyche.
Saussure, in 1897, finding that a species which he was describing for the Biologia was the same as the present insect, corrected the name in the text, but accidentally left his name Nemobius denticulatus as the name for the figure.

[Raleigh, N. C] Tills species, wliicli also belongs to the subgenus Eunemobius, is one of the most distinctive of the North American species of the genus Ne7nohiiis.
In the original description the supposed male of the present species was in fact N. maculatus, and in consequence that composite description is highly misleading.
There is a superficial resemblance of this species to N. palustris, but examination shows that it belongs to a different subgenus, since in cojifusus the distoventral spurs of the caudal tibiae are equal in length and the ovipositor is of the shorter type, armed at the apex above with heavy teeth, below with widely spaced serrations.
The bone-white maxillary palpi in both sexes distinguish the present species from all other North American members of the genus.
The nearest relationship is found in A^.
caroUnus, from which species confusus differs widely in the different color pattern, much darker general coloration and ovipositor which is different in shape and armament.
Based on a series of specimens from two localities in Indiana.
Single type here designated: 9 ; Tippecanoe Lake, Kosciusko County, Indiana, August 26, 1902.
(Blatchley) [Blatchley Collection].
Description of Type.
— Size small, form graceful; head small, not as full and with interantennal projection not as prominent as in carolinus, wider than the cephalic width of the pronotum.
Maxillary palpi sunilar to those of carolinus.
Eyes broad ovate, not at all prominent.
Pronotum with proportions much as in carolinus, narrowing slightly cephalad and with a medio-longitudinal impressed line more noticeable in the cephalic portion.
Tegmina half as long as caudal femora, resembling those of N. palustris excepting that in the present species the humeral vein is more conspicuous and the tegmina are divided by this vein into less rounded dorsal (here including the intermediate channel) and more nearly perpendicular lateral fields.
Wings absent.
Ovipositor slightly more than half as long as the caudal femora, feebly arcuate, distal third of same heavy, lanceolate; with both dorsal and ventral margins of apex armed, the former with rather widely spaced, very heavy, and somewhat recurved teeth, the latter with' widely spaced serrulations.
The limbs are somewhat more delicate than in carolinus ana, the spines of the caudal femora somewhat more slender than in that species.

Description of Allotype.
— Smaller but very similar to female in general appearance.
Tegmina transparent and very delicate; of same character as in carolinus but not as much wider than abdomen as in that species, when in repose the lateral margins of the dorsal field are more nearly straight, subparallel.

Although the series are not large, it is possible to see that there is but little variation in the species.
The eastern specimens average somewhat .smaller than those from Indiana.
In the original description the measurements for the male sex are, as has been stated, taken from a specimen of .V.
maculatus, while those of the female are, unfortunately, in almost every case exaggerated.
Color Notes.
— All of the specimens before us are of very much the same coloration.
Head, pronotum, and tegmina shining piceous, the latter transparent in the male, nearly transparent in the female.
Maxillary palpi with proximal segments piceous, last two segments white and very striking.
Dorsal surface of abdomen dark bistre; in the specimens of somewhat lighter coloration, bistre with the margins of the segments darker.
Limbs and ventral surface of body immaculate raw umber; in dark specimens mummy brown.
Both males and females of the present species have a very shiny appearance.
Distribution.
— The present species has been taken on the Atlantic coast from a few miles northwest of Washington, D. C, to Raleigh, N. C. The only other known point of distribution is the type locality in northern Indiana.
Biological Notes.
— Among the secretive species of Nemobius, this species is at present one of the least known.
We learn from Blatchley that it was first found, "quite common in some low, damp woods bordering Tippecanoe Lake .... living among the fallen leaves and beneath small chunks and chips."
No macropterous specimens are known, but it is probable that a long-winged form of the present species exists.
Synony^ny.
— It is strange that although Blatchley found this insect plentiful when the type series was taken, he apparently secured no males, but having taken males of N. maculatus in the same locality, unfortunately supposed these to be males of the new species.
The result is that the original description is a composite of the two species.
We have at present before us two males and two females of the type series which bear this out fully, as the males are both maculatus.
E. M. Walker has noted that Professor Morse pronounced the males of Blatchley's confusus a different species from the females, but that writer incorrectly surmised that the females were probably synonymous with N. carolinus Scudder.
Specimens Exmnined.

BY AMOS P. BROWN AND HENRY A, PILSBRY.
The two collections of fossils treated of in this paper were briefly alluded to in our second paper on the Gatun Formation,^ issued in January of this year.
They were collected by Professor W. B. Scott, 1911, with the assistance of Mr. D. F. Macdonald, geologist of the Isthmian Canal Commission.
As noted in our former paper, they came from two localities near the north end of the canal.
Collection 1.
— From the oyster-shell bearing layers in the Black Swamp near Mount Hope {Monkey Hill).
— The top of these beds is some four feet above the present sea level and they are encountered in digging for sewers in the town of Colon.
They are also known from Toro Point, across the bay from Colon.
The material consists largely of coral mud, with corals and coralline fragments and many molluscan remains mixed with more or less silt containing vegetable matter.
It was evidently shipped to us just as it came from the excavations, and contained the small species as they were imbedded in the mud of the sea bottom.
No volcanic ash was detected in this material.
While the species represented are almost all recent, some of them may be extinct, and at any rate have not yet been found in the living state.
In a paper published in 1912, Dr. DalP has described four of these found in our material.
Besides these four described by Dall, we now add three additional new species ; and a number of others were among the specimens in the collection, but not in sufficiently good form for description.
We have found some of these described new species in collections of recent shells in the A. N. S. P. collection, and it may be that none of these new species will be found to be really extinct when the molluscan fauna of that part of the Caribbean is fully known.
The fauna of these beds (which Professor Scott has named the Mount Hope Formation) numbers in this collection 69 named species of Gastropods, with 3 additional species named only as to genus; 45 named species of Pelecypods, with 3 additional species named as to genus; 2 Scaphopods; 6 species of corals and one barnacle.

Collection 2.
From the oyster-shell areas in the black, unconsolidated mud, uncomjormable on the Gatun Formation at the lower (north) end of the Gatun Locks.
— This deposit of mud extends from a few feet below sea level to about 10 feet above it at this point.
The black character of the deposit and the finding of definite vegetable remains in it, coupled with the observation that the oysters grew attached to mangroves or similar plants, shows that this was a deposit accumulated at the head of a bay or in an estuary.
From the clean condition in which this material reached us, it seems likely that this collection was the result of the screening of the discharge from a suction dredge.
This would also account for the absence of all small specimens from the collection.
The species present indicate shallow, probably brackish, water conditions.
The most notable species is the oyster (evidently growing attached to plants) and the great number of Congeria shells.
The oyster shells are often seen to be covered with barnacles.
Besides the one species of barnacle, there were three species of Gastropods and five species of Pelecypods.
One of the Gastropods, Neritina virginea Lam., has the color pattern of the shell beautifully preserved.
This deposit is probably more recent than that at Mount Hope, but is probably, like it.
Pleistocene.

B. Henderson, of Washington, for working over and determining a large part of the species listed below.

The anal fasciole is rather wide, concave, with a single prominent spiral cord near the suture.
Below the fasciole there are 'rounded, slightly protractive axial ribs, strongest at the shoulder, rapidly diminishing downwards, and ten in number on the penultimate whorl.
They are crossed by rather widely spaced spiral cords, of which three are visible on the penultimate, about a dozen on the last whorl.
The cOrds are equally developed on the ribs and in their intervals, and the spaces between them are occupied by very fine spiral striae, especially well developed on the fasciole.
The €oloration, though faded, is visible on some specimens.
There is a white band at the shoulder and several white lines below, on a tawny ground.

109,049 A. N. S. P. NEW SPECIES OF THE GENUS MOHNIA FROM THE NORTH PACIFIC.
BY WILLIAM HEALEY DALL.
In arranging for study the unequalled collection of Chrysodominse of the National Museum, I found an unexpected number of species of the genus Mohnia Friele, of which one or two species, including the type, are found in the North Atlantic.
Diagnoses of some of the undescribed forms are appended.
Mohnia robusta "• sp.
Shell solid, stout, of about eight whorls, the apical ones being always eroded in adult shells; the upper whorls with 15-16 axial, rounded, little elevated, nearly straight riblets, which become feebler and finally vanish on the last whorl; suture appressed, slightly constricted; other axial sculpture of rather irregular, retractively arcuate incremental lines; spiral sculpture of obscurely channelled grooves which become wider with age and on the penultimate whorl are about 14 in number; on the last whorl they are coarser on the base, but nowhere sharp or clean cut; the whole surface is covered with a dark olive periostracum, under which the shell is white; aperture ovate, the body erased white, the pillar gyrate but not pervious, the outer lip thin, sharp ; the canal rather wide and strongly recurved.
The nucleus is not preserved on any of the specimens.
The operculum is dark horn color and forms about one whorl .
Length of type specimen (about five whorls) 36.5; of last whorl 25; maximum diameter 15 mm.
Bering Sea in 987 fathoms, off the Pribiloff Islands.
Mohnia corbis n. sp.
Shell with the apex eroded and about five rounded whorls remaining; white, covered with an olivaceous yellow periostracum; suture appressed; axial sculpture of numerous, rather irregular, prominent incremental lines; spiral sculpture of, between the sutures, about seven cord-like ridges, which on the last whorl become flatter and strap-like; the interspaces are irregular, but usually wider; between the cord at the shoulder and the suture behind there is a flattish space with four or five obsolete finer spirals; contrary to custom, the base of the last whorl and canal have no spiral sculpture; aperture short-oval, the.
outer lip thin, short, the body erased white, the pillar gyrate and minutely pervious; canal very short, wide, and slightly recurved; operculum with a small subspiral nucleus.
Length of shell 31; of last whorl 20 ; maximum diameter 14 mm.
Bering Sea, off the Pribiloff Islands in 1,771 fathoms.
Mohnia vernalis "■ sp.
Shell small, thin, white under a light green periostracum, of about seven whorls; the apex apparently blunt, but always more or less eroded; the nepionic whorls with a few spiral grooves, the following whorl or two with about 16 rather prominent short ribs, most prominent at the periphery, with narrower interspaces crossed by fine spiral striae with wider interspaces; the ribs rapidly become obsolete and on the last three whorls are absent, the surface being then only marked by very arcuate incremental lines, the striae becoming obsolete, except on the base near the canal where there are a few coarse spirals; aperture short-ovate, the outer lip thin, sharp, the body erased, the canal short, wide, slightly recurved, the pillar gyrate, minutely pervious; the operculum with a subspiral nucleus.
Length of five whorls (the apex being eroded) 21 ; of last whorl 14; maximum diameter 10 mm.
Off Tillamook Bay, Oregon, in 786 fathoms.
Mohnia siphonoides n.'sp.
Shell solid, rotund, white, with an olivaceous polished periostracum, and with about six whorls; apex eroded, apparently blunt; sculpture of faint incremental lines and sparse zigzag oljsolete ridges recalling those of Tritonofusus hypolispus Dall, but less distinct; whorls rather flattish, aperture ovate; outer lip slightly reflected, body with a thin layer of callus, pillar gyrate, not pervious, canal short, recurved.
Operculum with a small subspiral nucleus.
Length (eroded) 34; length of last whorl 26; maximum diameter 15 mm.
Bering Sea, off Pribiloff Islands, in 987 fathoms.
If it were not for the operculum, this shell would certainly be referred to Tritonofusus.
Mohnia exquisita n. sp.
Shell delicate, white under a greenish periostracum, with about seven whorls; suture not appressed; axial sculpture of incremental lines which cut the spiral keels and minutely serrate their edges occasionally; spiral sculpture, fundamentally of two prominently elevated keels; one at the shoulder recurved, the other vertical to its base; with ten or twelve not prominent spiral cords on the base.
In one specimen the space between the keels has no spiral sculpture, in another there are one or two minor keels and numerous faint spirals; this specimen also has a minor keel marginating the base.
Aperture rather small, the outer lip sharp, thin, modified by the keels; inner lip erased, white; pillar gyrate, minutely pervious; canal short, wide, hardly recurved.
Operculum with subspiral nucleus and much transparent enamel on the margin of the proximal surface.
Length 31; length of last whorl 20; maximum diameter 14 mm.
Bering Sea, off Koniugi Islands, in 1,766 fathoms.
Mohnia buccinoides n. sp.
Shell large, thin, with more than six whorls; white, covered with an unpolished pale gray periostracum; suture not appressed; whorls well rounded; spiral sculpture of a single moderately prominent cord at the periphery, and numerous fine spiral striae, with somewhat irregular wider interspaces; axial sculpture only of incremental lines which are not conspicuous; aperture rounded-quadrate, the outer lip thin, sharp, the body erased, the pillar gyrate, minutely pervious; canal short, wide, recurved; operculum with a subspiral nucleus.
Length of (eroded) shell 38; of last whorl 27; maximum diameter 19 mm.
Off Hondo, Japan, in 905 fathoms.
This would certainly be taken for an immature Biiccinini?
if it were not for the operculum.
Mohnia japonica n. si>.
Shell small, polished, white under a dark green periostracum, the apex eroded, but having apparentlj^ about six whorls; the first intact whorl shows faint indications of obsolete ribbing, the later whorls are smooth except for faint incremental lines and obscure, almost microscopic spiral stride; on the base there are the usual spiral threads near the canal.
Aperture elongate-ovate, outer lip thin, sharp; body erased, canal short, wide, recurved, axis gyrate, not pervious.
Length of shell (eroded) 19; of last whorl 13; maximum diameter 8.5 mm.
Off Sado Island, Japan Sea, in 225 fathoms.
Mohnia kurilana n. sj.
Shell small, very delicate, with a blunt nucleus and six and a half well-rounded whorls; whitish under a thin olivaceous velvety periostracum; nucleus blunt, axially minutely sharply ribbed; the next whorl with many minute riblets is cancellated by.
revolving threads; the subsequent whorls have six or seven nearly uniform 33 revolving grooves separated by wider flattish interspaces, which, on the last whorl, cover the whole surface, including the base; suture distinct, not appressed; aperture short, the outer lip very thin, sharp, the body without callus, the axis gyrate, minutely pervious; the canal short, hardly recurved; operculum with a subspiral nucleus.
Length of shell 14; of last whorl 9; maximum (hameter 7.5 mm.
Off the Kuril Islands, in 229 fathoms.
This shell has the aspect of Thalassoplanes, hnt the operculum of Mohnia.
Mohnia hondoensis n. sj..
Shell small, of about six whorls, whitish, covered by an olivaceous periostracum; first two whorls denuded, the next with a peripheral carina and about ten ribs which are prominent only at the periphery, and as well as the carina become obsolete on the last whorl; there are also faint microscopic spiral striae here and there; aperture narrow, outer lip sharp, body erased; pillar gyrate, not pervious; canal short, wide, slightly recurved.
Length of shell 12; of last whorl 9.5; maximum diameter 6 mm.
Off Hondo, Japan, in 76 fathoms.
The above species were dredged at various times liy the II.
