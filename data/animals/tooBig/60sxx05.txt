316 Introduction.
The Lycosidce form one of the most successful of all families of spiders.
Their common names of wolf and running spiders indicate their dominant traits.
All live close to the earth, roaming freely and boldly, and with rare exceptions capturing their prey by the chase rather than by means of webs or other strategy.
They are among the most familiar and widely distributed of spiders.
The Piratas and most of the small and excessively active Pardosas keep close to the water, when alarmed running out freely over the surface, in adaptation to which action their tarsi are specially modified in the arrangement of hairs and bristles.
The larger Lycosas may mingle their colors with those of the dried leaves and twigs of the woods, lurk beneath the stones of roadside and field, wander in the open or burrow in the sand of the seashore or the soil of the plain.
Everywhere they are familiar; not because of large number of species, nor because of their bold open habits, but especially because of the excessive abundance of individuals resulting from successful adaptation to conditions widely available.
All true spiders depend upon living animals, mostly insects, for food.
Since they ingest only the body juices of their prey, what seems at first an amazing quantity of insects is required to satisfy their nutritive needs.
Most spiders have met this requirement through the development of instinct and skill, accompanied of course by those structural modifications necessary for their effective exercise, in the construction of webs.
The line of divergence of the Lycosidce, however, has been in the direction of capacity for taking prey by the chase.
The high arched cephalothorax and the long stout legs plainly bespeak strength and speed.
But strength and speed alone would be quite ineffective without the simultaneous development of the sensory system, to enable the spiders to detect and with some certainty to follow their prey.
Such development has affected strongly the sight; other senses, excepting touch, being seemingly but feebly developed.
This is manifest in the differentiations in size and arrangement of the eyes.
It has been shown that the arrangement of the eyes is such as to make the animal aware of movements within its limit of vision in front, at the sides and through a considerable arc behind, the arc directly forward being covered particularly well.
The eyes fall very clearly in three rows.
The first row, situated across the lower part of the face, is composed of four small eyes placed in different planes; the second of two eyes, large in size and directed antero-laterally ; the third of two medium-sized eyes situated farther back on the pars cephalica and directed laterocaudally.
This arrangement of the eyes is apparently associated with the characteristic elevation of the pars cephalica.
The high dorsally narrowed cephalothorax and the placement of the eyes m three distinct rows as described are features by which the Lycosidce are usually to be detected at a glance.
Other characters serving with those mentioned to distinguish members of this family are the three claws of the tarsi, the notching of the trochanters at the outer end beneath, and the excavation of the posterior piece of the superior lorum of the abdominal pedicel.
Most of the wolf spiders build no webs of any kind for ensnaring their prey.
A few forms {Sosippus, Hippasa), however, construct sheet webs over stones and low bushes with central, funnel-like retreats, much like those of some Agelenidce.
In these web-constructing forms there is a strong development of the superior spinnerets, similar to that in the latter family.
The females without exception enclose their eggs in cocoons, Avhich they carry about attached to their spinnerets until the young hatch.
After hatching the young are carried about on the back of the parent until able to shift for themselves with some degree of safety.
In making these cocoons the spiders first spin upon the ground a circular disk, which they enlarge usually until its diameter is about equal to -the length of their bodies.
A suitable scaffolding of threads is constructed preliminary to the spinning of the disk.
After the basal disk is completed the spider presses out from the genital ducts upon the center of the disk a drop of viscid fluid, into which the eggs are allowed to fall.
She then spins over the eggs a covering sheet, fastening its edges to the basal disk.
The cocoon is then cut loose from its attachments by means of the chelicerae, the ragged edges are neatly taken up and fastened to the wall of the cocoon, and over the whole fresh threads are spun while the cocoon, held beneath the cephalothorax by means of the third legs, is rotated by chelicerse and palps.
The result is a neat egg-sac, lenticular in form and showing a distinct seam {Pardosa), or spherical in form and either -wath a less distinct seam at equator (Pirata) or without a seam evident (Lycosa).
As a rule the Lycosids born during any season pass the succeeding winter in the half-grown condition, not reaching maturity until the following summer or late spring.
The smaller members of the family live but a single year, and during this time build no retreats for themselves.
The larger Lycosas, however, are known to live for several years.
Many of these, build burrows, which they close upon the approach of winter by means of plugs or lids.
These burrows may ])e mere shallow, nest-like excavations loosely lined with silk or may be deeper, more skilfully executed tunnels.
In some cases a rampart or turret is built up about the opening of the burrow, apparently to prevent the drifting in of debris, etc.
This rampart may be composetl of particles of sand or earth, or of pieces of straw, grass or sticks.
superposed and bound together by means of silk.
The same burrow may be occupied by a spider for several seasons, the occupant remodelling the burrow if injured by accident, or enlarging it if outgrown (see L. fatifera, etc.).
The number of species and genera of Lycosidce is very much smaller than would at first thought seem probable.
These bold wanderei"s, with their strong, long legs, the black spines upon which standing out threateningly during excitement suggest their aggressiveness, spread out persistently in e^â€¢ery direction.
Isolation of any part of a species for a long time would be expected to be rare, and the establishment of distinct forms, therefore, so far as dependent upon this factor, infrequent.
There are comparatively few species of wide distribution, rather than a large number of limited range.
This wide range of species is accompanied naturally by a great deal of fluctuating variability in many of their features.
A result has been a surprisingly large number of synonj^ms, consecjuent wpon examinations of limited number of specimens from widely separated localities.
For example, species that range from New England to the West and far South become lighter and lighter in coloration.
In several species the brightly colored individuals that prevail in Texas would appeal to one at first as surely specifically distinct from the darker forms of the North.
But all gradations are found when sufficient material is studied, especially in that from intermediate regions, while apparently no significant differences at all appear in less variable structural features.
Important variations are discussed in detail in the present work under the respective species.
In this connection a main source of difficulty has been, indeed, the placing of too great reliance upon purely relative characters that undergo greater variation than has been recognized.
Even in the treatment of genera this purely relative nature of the characters commonly used has left much room for diversity in opinion and usage.
It is not, therefore, really surprising to find that genera accepted without question by one student are unhesitatingly denied by others.
Some genera that have from time to time been proposed are clearly artificial, having, it would seem, been erected with a view to convenience rather than in an effort to express genetic relationship.
All of the characters that have been conmionly used in separating, e.g., Pardosa and Lycosa, somewhere become uncertain, the result having been many incorrect references of species.
And so, also, is it with other genera.
My own studies of the Lycosidce long ago convinced me that the clearest and most definite characters for limiting not only the species but the genera of the Lycosidce as well, are those presented in the copulatory organs.
In the present contribution much reliance is placed upon these characters as indices of relationship.
They have not previously been used in the definition of genera.
It has been necessary to introduce a provisional terminology, perhaps sufficient for present descriptive purposes, for parts of the copulatory organs.
Careful comparative studies on the morphology of the palpal organs of male spiders are much needed to give us a consistent general terminology.
As here considered the portion of the family Lycosidce in the fauna of America north of Mexico includes eight genera: Allocosa, Pardosa, Schizocosa, Lycosa, Trahea,Sosippus, Sosilaus and Pirata.
Lycosa is more comprehensive than the other genera and its species fall into a number of natural but mostly intergrading groups.
Of these groups one in pari corresponding to Trochosa of some authors is most divergent and compact.
(See further under Lycosa.)
Altogether, in the neighborhood of one hundred and fifty specific names have been erected for the forms under these genera ; but of these not more than half are really "good."
The species that I have been able to regard as distinct and recognizable are distributed among the genera as follows: Trahea, Sosippus and Sosilaus, e&ch with one; Allocosa, five; Schizocosa, three; Pirata, nine; Pardosa, seventeen ; Lycosa, thirty.
Of the material studied mention should be made first of the section of Lycosidce in the rich collection of Aranea.
at Cornell University, for the privilege of using which and for other unfailing courtesies I am deeply obliged to Prof. J. H. Comstock.
The Cornell collection includes not only species from New York State and other parts of the North, but also a good representation of forms from the South and a number of species from the West.
My own collection consists of specimens collected in California, Utah and New York by myself, and of a large number from many different localities obtained through others.

The Family Lycosid.e.
Cephalothorax elongated, much longer than wide, attenuated anteriorly.
The pars thoracica high and subprismatic, narrow above and oval in outline, with the posterior border truncate and concave at the middle; a distinct fine median sulcus which is rather long always present, as are also more or less distinctly impressed radiating striae.
Pars cephalica elevated and arched, distinctly separated from the par's thoracica by cervical furrows which unite at an angle at the median dorsal line, these more rarely indistinct above; pars cephalica with front truncated or more or less obtusely rounded.
The face high, trapeziform or, less commonly, with the sides subparallel; in profile vertical, or at least very steep.
Eyes all of the diurnal type; always distinctly arranged in three rows, of which the first is composed of four eyes and is located upon the lower part of the face, the second composed of two eyes at the upper part of the face or semidorsal in position, and the third, also composed of two eyes, in a strictly dorsal position; eyes of the first row small and comparatively close together, in a straight, procurved or rarely recurved row, the lateral eyes on more or less evident tubercles and with their visual axes directed antero-ventrally ; eyes of second row very large, occupying a transverse space, in most cases wider than that of the first row, less commonly of the same length or shorter, their visual axes directed antero-laterally ; eyes of third row large, almost always more widely separated than those of the second row, with which they thus outline a trapeziform area (quadrangle of posterior eyes), their visual axes directed more or less caudo-laterally.
Clypeus comparatively narrow, always narrower than the width of the area outlined by the first and second rows of eyes (quadrangle of anterior eyes).
Chelicerce long and robust, always vertical in position in both sexes ; at base a well-marked and rather large lateral condyle; both upper and lower margins of furrow armed, the upper with two or, more commonly, with three teeth, of which the median is much the largest, and the lower margin with from two to four stout conical teeth; posterior face always marked with a distinct oblique stria, along the inner side of which, especially in the middle region, is a well-developed, often dense, pilose band ; upper margin of furrow bordered with a subdense pilose band or fringe.
Labium free; the ventral surface flat or, much more commonly, convex; more or less attenuated anteriorly, with front margin truncate or obtuse; from longer than wide to wider than long; much shorter than the endites.
Endites longer than wide, more or less excavated within and fitting over the sides of the labium, externally roimded and never much narrowed at base; erect, never obliquely inclined; dorsal surface flat or a little concave; distally the supra-external border with a fine serrulate line or serrula ; siipero-internal border with a dense pilose band or scopula.
Sternum longer than wide; large, subcordiform, being truncated in front, rounded at the sides and attenuate to a point caudally.
Legs long or moderately long, the fourth longest, then the first, the third shortest in the great majority of cases ; but there are exceptions in which the third legs are longer than the second, and others in which the second are longer than the first.
The femora, tibiae and metatarsi and usually also some or all of the patellae armed Avith spines ; the anterior tibise with three pairs of spines beneath, less commonly with two (Pirata), and sometimes with as many as five (SosUaus); these and other spines of the anterior legs often much reduced and sometimes absent.
In some small species the tarsi are beneath, all simply and rather sparsely setose, but in most they are at least in part more or less provided with scopula composed uniformly of fine, flat lanceolate and slenderh^ pointed hairs, never of distally enlarged hairs; in the smaller species these scopulsB may be present only along the sides of the ventral faces of the anterior tarsi ; but in the larger species {Sosippus and most Lycosas) the entire ventral surface of the anterior tarsi is densely scopulate, and the metatarsi are usually similarly or less densely scopulate, and the tibiae are also sometimes scopulate distally; in these larger forms the posterior tarsi are scopulate, but have their scopulae divided by a median line or band of setae; never with dense fasciculae at base of claws.
Tarsi bearing three claws, of which the superior are strong and broad basally, and bear a series of teeth from five to seven, rarely more, in mmiber, these being mostly confined to the basal half of the claws; the unpaired claw small, bent abruptly downward, almost always naked, rarely with a single tooth.
Trochanters invariably notched or excavated at distal end beneath.
Superior lorum of the pedicel of the abdomen composed of two principal, very unequal pieces, of which the smaller posterior one is truncated or somewhat concave behind, and in front is notched or excavated for the reception of the angularly or roundly attenuated posterior part of the longer anterior piece; at each side of the principal plates is a slender, anteriorly attenuated piece.
Spinnerets six in number; the anterior ones short and relatively stout, contiguous or subcontiguous ; the posterior more or less separated from each other, mostly more slender than the anterior and either of the same length or longer, composed of two articles, of which the second is short and rounded and usually subject to retraction within the fii-st. or less commonly longer and conical (Sosippus) ; median pair slender, of moderate length.
Body clothed with simple hair, or more rarely with some of plumose ty]3e intermixed (Sossipus and some Pardosas).
Genital plate or epigynum of the female mostly simple ; either a simple iinfurrowed plate or a plate depressed or furrowed longitudinally and with the depressed area divided by a ridge-like elevation (guide), which in the large majority of cases extends laterally on each side at its posterior end.
The transverse portion of the guide often (Lycosa sens, str.)
distinctly more elevate than the septal portion immediatel}' in front of it and extending on each side to behind the openings of the spermathecse ; median piece of guide posteriorly and the transverse pieces on anterior side with the upper free edges mostly more or less â€¢extended horizontally in plate-like expansions, which are usually narrow but may be wide (lateral plates or alee of guide).
Palpus of the male long, differing uniformly from that of the most nearlj' related families {e.g., Pisauridce and Agelenidos) in never having femur, patella, or tibia armed with any manner of process or apophysis.
Tarsus or cymbium comparatively simple, boat-shaped; completely covering the bulb, the alveolus occup5dng usually not more than twothirds of the ventral area; terminal part of the tarsus acuminate and bearing one, two, or rarely three mostly stout, always untoothed spines (transformed claws), occasionally imarmed.
Bulb comparativel}simple and compact; embolus only rarely exerted, in most h'ing upon a special fold (lectus) at front of the larger basal lobe or division, this fold in many with a lobe {auricida) extending forward in front of its exterior end ; lobe of the conductor bearing one to several chitinous processes (tenacula); either an erect and conspicuous apophysis (Pirata) or transverse, and appressed ; basal division of bulb bearing strongly chitinized fokl or apophysis (scopus) in a median (Pardosa) or exterior position (Lycosa), or with such fold or apophysis absent or but weakly developed (Pirata), its absence or weak development being correlated with the absence of furrow and guide in the epigj'-num of the female; a chitinous plate or area (lunate area) at base of bulb practically alwa3's exposed, the area being of varying size in the different genera, but of quite constant relative extent and position in each.
The most simple and generalized condition is shown in Pirata.

Pars cephalica moderately narrow, the sides steep, gently declined anteriorly; face elevated, its sides straight and very steep, subvertical.
Quadrangle of posterior eyes one-fourth or more the length of the cephalothorax.
Seen from above the posterior eyes are at most but very little more than their diameter removed from the margins of pars cephalica (PI.
VIII, fig.
2).
Chelicerce in the great majority of cases with but two teeth on the upper margin of the furrow, the lower margin with three, of which the third is usually much reduced (PI.
VIII, fig.
1).
Legs long and especially the metatarsi and tarsi slender.
Anterior tarsi scopulate, laterally the median ventral face occupied by a setose band (PI.
VIII, fig.
7), posterior tarsi simply setose; metatarsus of fourth leg relatively long, most commonly longer than the tibia + patella (especially so in d^ ) , more rarely of same length or a little shorter ; tibia + patella of fourth legs always longer than the cephalothorax.
The color markings frequently due in large part to the arrangement of the pubescence in spots and streaks without corresponding marks in the tegument, such markings', of course, being evident only in the living or dry specimens.
The cephalothorax in this genus has always a more or less evident light median stripe of a characteristic dagger form.
In nearly all species, although the markings may be much obscured in some, there is on the dorsum of the abdomen a pale basal mark which runs to a point near the middle, each side of the apex and also usually each side of the middle of which is an angular pale spot, having a dark dot at its center; posteriorly a series of such ocellate spots more or less united at the middle line into chevrons.
Il^ Spiders of small or less commonly of medium size, all characterized by excessive agility.
The males are commonly smaller than the females; but do not differ much in coloration.
As in Lycosa and other^, genera, however, the anterior legs of the male are often distinguished by some peculiar development of color structure.
Pardps^s build jio .retreat, wandering about during the cocooning season as well as at other times.
The cocoon is more or less lenticular inform, and shows a distinct seam about the equator, along which the break is made when the spiderlings issue to mount the parent.
The cocoon is typically greenish-yellow or greenish-black, but only very rarely white.
The individuals of this genus rarely live more than one year.

While the males are easily distinguishable, the females of this species and of milvina are much alike both in general appearance and in the structure of the epigyna.
Aside from the differences in the epigyna, which are difficult to state, the cephalothorax of saxatilHs is relatively higher in front and slopes more decidedly caudally and the face protrudes above more strongly.
There are constant differences in the proportions of the legs.
The markings of saxatilis are finer.

One of the commonest and most widely distributed of North American Pardosas.
Specimens from the South are lighter than those from the North, the sternum being frequently yellow or white without marks, and at other times being covered in varying degrees with black dots, the dots in some covering entire sternum, except for the anterior median light stripe, and in others found only in a single row along each margin.
In the same locality all gradations may be found between dark, typically colored individuals and the pale forms.
Pardosa pauxilla Mtg.
Female.
â€” Sides of cephalothorax blackish brown or deep chocolate color; a rather wide yellow or pale brown band along each lateral margin extending forward to the clypeus which is of the same light color; eye region black; back of eyes a median dagger-shaped light brown stripe of usual character.
Chelicene yellow.
Labium, endites and coxce of legs beneath yellow or yellowish brown.
Sternum yellowish brown, blackish toward margins and with scattered black spots over the middle portion.
Legs also yellow or yellowish brown with numerous dark annuli which are deep and distinct on the femora and tibiae, but are less strong or sometimes indistinct on the metatarsi; of these annuli there are four on each femur and tibia and three on each metatarsis; each patella has a median annulus with indications in some of darkened ends.
Abdomen with dorsum black to deep brown minutely dotted with yellow; at base a yellow lanceolate stripe with an angular spot each side of apex as usual, followed behind by a series of wide chevron-marks of the ordinary character; because of the extent of the yellow markings in some the dorsum appears to be occupied over its middle region from base to spinnerets by a yellowish band which narrows caudally and encloses rather indistinct dark markings; sides of abdomen dark like the lateral portions of dorsum, but the yellow dots larger, becoming more and more extended and confluent ventrally, finally passing into the inmiaculate yellow or yellowish white venter.
Spinnerets pale brown.
Epigynum reddish brown.

Female 6 mm.
long; light yellow with brown markings.
The cephalothorax has two wide brown longitudinal stripes united at the front of the head where they are nearly black, and a fine dark line each side next the legs.
The sides of the abdomen are brown, with a very distinct light spot over the dorsal vessel, and a row of transverse light spots behind.
The sternum is brown with a light spot in the middle.
The abdomen is light beneath with a narrow brown stripe half its length on each side.
The epigynum is bright orange brown, and the front pair of spinnerets are black.
The legs are spotted with brown, the spots sometimes grouped in rings; the tibiae are the darkest parts of the legs.
The epigynum has the guide short and wide, but this part is transparent and the overlapping sides are not easily seen, so that it aj)pears narrow.
(PI.
XV, fig.

In the male the cephalothorax and abdomen are darker, and the legs lighter except at the base, where the upper sides of the coxae and part of the femora are darker than in the female.
The head and palpi are black, with the patella and tibia a little lighter on top and probabl}^ having some light hairs when alive.
The male palpi are large, the tarsus being about as long as tibia and patella.
The palpal organ is dark colored and projects a little from the bowl of the tarsus.
The basal hook is rounded in the middle and curves in a hook toward the base.
(PI.

This species is about the same size and color as P. pallida Emerton of New England.
The sternum is dark with a light median stripe on its front half, while in pallida the sternum is light with four dark lines or rows of spots converging behind .
In the males the palpi, mandibles and maxillae are darker than in pallida.
The epigynum resembles that of pallida, but is shorter and wider.
The male palpi have the scopus short and turned down at the point, while in pallida it is long and slender, and extends across the whole width of palpus.

Type locality.
â€” Massachusetts and Connecticut.
//abi'^o/.â€” Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island!, Canada, New York !, New Jersey !, District of Columbia !, Pennsylvania, Indiana !, Iowa !, Kansas !, Arkansas !, Texas !.
A very familiar species in the Northern States, found among stones along streams and also to some extent remote from water in diy places.
Its general dark gray color blends well with the color of the stones among which it lives .
Specimens from the West and South are commonly much lighter than specimens from the Northeast, and in them the marginal spots on the cephalothorax form a band except for narrow dark cross-lines; the legs are more conspicuously annulate, the light rings contrasting more strongly with the dark.
As other species having the same range as lapidicina undergo similar changes in brightness of color, and especially since the light form of lapidicina and all intermediate forms are not rare in the North, the Western specimens of this Pardosa ought not to be granted rank as separate species or variety.
Type specimens of venusta Bks.
that I have seen are not fully adult, and agree perfectly with immature specimens of lapidicina.

brunnea.
â€” Ehierton now believes his brunnea to be a synonym of modica (glacialis).
All the specimens I have had the opportunity^ of examining from New England, however, present small differences both in epigynum and in the male palpus from specimens of modica from Greenland and Canada.
But the species is subject to much variation ; and it is uncertain whether the New England forms can be maintained more than tentatively as a distinct variety.

Female.
â€” Cephalothorax brownish black with three rather narrow longitudinal bands covered with whitish hair, the middle one reaching to the pars cephalica, trimcated and geminated anteriorly, narrowing backwards, the lateral bands supramarginal, continuous, rather uneven in the upper margin.
Chelicerce dull yellowish or ferruginous brown.
Labium blackish, with pale apex.
Endites dark yellowish brown, their palpi of the same color, the femoral joint with blackish longitudinal streaks and spots.
Sternum black.
Legs of a dark and dull yellowish brown, the femora with dark streaks and spots above and on the sides, limiting above two large oblong pale spots divided longitudinally by a fine black line; the patellae and tibiae have each three blackish longitudinal lines.
Abdomen brownish, with traces of a short white band at the anterior margin of the dorsum.
Epigynum ferruginous.
Spinnerets blackish.
Cephalothorax rather long and narrow, with the sides of the pars cephalica almost perpendicular.
14 The anterior row of eyes but veiy slightly, scarcely j^erceptibly, curved forwards, its central eyes of the same size as (at least not greater than) the laterals, and somewhat more distant from each other than from the lateral eyes ; eyes of the second series separated by an interval not much (about one-fourth) greater than their diameter.
Chelicerm narrow, but slightly convex longitudinally; their length is greater than the height of the face and the length of tlie patellai.
Labium with slightly rounded apex.
Seen from the under side the anterior tihice show four pairs of spines, the third pair belonging to the sides of the joint.
The e-pigynum forms no deep fovea, as in P. fuscula, ex.gr., the elevated area shows, when the hair is rubbed off, a sj-^stem of short furrows and impressions rather difficult to describe, and forming a large oblong figure, rather narrow in its anterior half, then dilated gradually with rounded sides, and truncated behind ; the anterior part, which is divided from the posterior by a large but not deep transverse depression, shows two longitudinal parallel furrows, the anterior apices of which are rounded; the narrow interval between these furrows is pointed anteriorly, and has in the middle a very fine longitudinal furrow ; the posterior broad part of the epigynum shows on each side a deep, oblique, incurved, crescent-formed fovea; the space between these fovese is triangular, with the apex directed backward, and divided by a deep middle longitudinal furrow.

; tib.
+ pat., 3.75 mm.
Male.â€” A male thought to belong to this species differs by the cephalothorax being of a purer black, with the lateral bands less distinct.
The legs, which have the same markings as in the female, are of a clearer yellowish-brown color than in that sex, but darker at the base; the coxae are black above and blackish beneath, the thighs also blackish on the under side towards the base; the tarsi are yellowish brown scarcely black at the extreme apex (as in the female).
The palpi are very dark yellowish brown (the tibial joint almost black) with black lines, and the tarsal joint quite black; the tibial joint is thickly clothed with black hair; also the other joints are black-haired.
The abdomen has a very distinct narrow band at base covered with whitish hair; venter blackish.
The patella of the palpus is somewhat longer than broad, cylindrical ; tibia scarcely longer than the patella but broader, being slightly and gradually dilated toward the apex; the tarsus is as long as the two preceding joints together, almost pear-shaped.
The genital bulb is very high at the base on the under side, this elevated part being obliquely truncated and emarginate on the outer side; it shows in front a large fovea, from which issues a very short and coarse obtuse tooth directed obliquely forward and outward, and bearing at its base a longer and narrower pointed black tooth directed outward and curved backward and downward; this latter tooth lies almost concealed in the fovea; in the middle of the outer margin of the bulb a strong, pointed, downwardly directed black tooth is visible; close to the anterior side of its posterior elevated portion is a transverse spine-like costa (embolus); the anterior lower part of the bulb shows on the outer side two pale appendages or narrow lobes.

(From Thorell.)
Habitat.
â€” Strawberry Harbor ( 9 ) and Square Island (o'), Labrador.
The female was captured July 28; the male also in July.
"This species greatly resembles P. fuscula; but it is smaller, with the sides of the head more perpendicular, the interval between the two largest eyes is smaller, and the form of the vulva is quite different.
P. lahradorensis is a Pardosa C. Koch, while fuscula (and furcifera) appear to belong to Leimonia C.
Koch."
(Thorell.)
In general coloration, proportions and' structure, and especially in the structure of the J* palpus, this form is certainl}very close to modica, and it may prove not to be anything different.
It is possible that the differences in the epigynum, which Thorell thinks considerable, may be due to the type of lahradorensis being not entirely adult, the epigynum of immature specimens of modica which I have seen seeming largely to agree with the description of that of lahradorensis given as above by Thorell.

One single adult female from Lake Leonore in Orange County.
This tiny Pardosa is not known to me at first hand.
It is certainly a very unusual form, if it be true that the "distance from the lateral eyes to the margin of the clypeus and to the eyes in the middle row is about thrice their diameter," a statement much to be questioned.

Pars cephalica truncated in front, its sides moderately rounded and sloping, the face rather high, its sides slanting in varying degrees, sometimes approaching the Pardosa type more and sometimes the Lycosa.
The quadrangle of posterior eyes in length averaging one-fourth the length of the cephalothorax, being thus longer than in Lycosa.
The legs are long and moderately stout, inclining to be slender distally; the anterior tarsi scopulate, at least laterally, the posterior tarsi setose below; the tibia and patella of the fourth legs taken together are always considerably longer than the cephalothorax.
The median light band of the cephalothorax widens uniformly from behind for^^â€¢ard to the eyes; it is constricted in front of dorsal groove, but otherwise its margins are nearly straight.
The abdomen in all is marked above by a broad light band which is nearly or fully as wide as the dorsum and which extends over its entire length from base to spinnerets ; this band enclosing at base a lanceolate outline, and behind in some also a series of transverse angular lines of varying degrees of distinctness; sides of abdomen dark in color, black at least across anterior lateral angles; venter pale.
Spiders of medium or small size.
The males are but little different in size from the females, but are sometimes characterized by having the tibiae of the front pair of legs darkened in color and densely clothed with long black hair which stands out in brush-like form.
The cocoon is spherical, without any seam at equator, and is white in color.

Emerton states that in New Haven, Cr)nn., it is "common in open woods among dead leaves.
Adult about June 1."

Hentz states that males of this species were common in Alabama in April, but that he did not find females.
So also, it may be noted, all but a few of the specimens of rather extensive collections of this species, made at several places in the South in the early spring of 1903, which I have examined are males.
The marking of the venter of the abdomen figured by Hentz is strongly developed in some individuals, obscure or absent in others.
In size and general colorati(m this species is much like ocreata, except as to the first legs of the males; and it has also approximately the same geographical range.

Pars cephalica moderately elevated: in front truncate to more or less obtuse; its lateral margins either a little converging anteriorly or parallel; sides rounded outward below; face moderately high, trapeziform, evidently widening downward; in profile either vertical or sloping forward from top to the base of chelicerae (PI.
IX, fig.
5).
Quadrangle of posterior eyes in most but one-fifth or less the length of the cephalothorax.
Seen from above, the eyes of second and third rows are much more than their diameter from lateral margins of the pars cephalica (PI.
IX, fig.
2).
Chelicene long and robust, in length at least one and one-half times the height of the face ; upper margin with three teeth of the usual proportions, or the first one rarely absent; lower margin with three stout teeth which are subequal, or with the third sometimes reduced, or else with twÂ© stout eciual teeth (PL IX, figs.
1 and 3).
Legs robust, the distal joints usually not slender as in Pardosa.
Tarsi and usually also metatarsi of anterior legs scopulate and with the 15 scopulse undivided (PI.
IX, fig.
4), the posterior tarsi scopulate at sides, being divided along the median ventral face by a setose or setose and spiniilose band (PI.
IX, fig.
6).
Metatarsus of fourth legs shorter than tibia + .
patella of same pair in most cases, rarely the metatarsus the longer more especially in males.
Tibia + patella of last legs sometimes a little longer than and sometimes of same length as or, as in the great majority of cases, shorter than the cephalothorax.
Spiders of large or medium size, including the largest forms of the family.
There is much variation in coloration, although in the several groups of species the same system or pattern of markings is more or less evident.
Most of the larger North American species show a decided tendency to have the ventral surface of the body black in whole or in considerable part, such seeming indeed to be the tendency in large Lycosidce everywhere.
The body of the males is in most cases smaller than that of the females, with the legs proportionately much longer and with their several joints of proportionately different lengths.
Lycosas make a white spherical cocoon which only exceptionally shows a seam about its equator, the tissue being normally smooth and homogeneous.
The smaller species carry the cocoons about as do the Pardosas, which they resemble also in building no retreats.
The larger species, however, during the cocooning season are sedentary.
Practically all of these larger species make nests or burrows of some kind, these varying greatly in form and depth.
Some of the burrows are deep and have the openings surrounded by a rampart or turret formed of .sticks and leaves or of bits of dirt cemented together with silk {e.g., fatifera, arenicola, carolinensis) .
Other species excavate only shallower pits or nests beneath stones or logs, and surround these excavations with a low rampart of earth or sticks, etc., and which they may occupy only during the cocooning season (e.g., helluo).
The genus Lycosa as here considered is divisible into a number of groups ; but for the most part these are found more or less closely to intergrade when a sufficient number of species are taken into consideration.
The most aberrant and distinct of these groups, so far as concerns the American species, is that containing many of the forms referred to Trochosa C. K. {avara Keys., gosiuta new, cinerea Fab., ruhicunda Keys., etc.).
The material representing this group that I have been able to study (American forms only) has not been sufficiently extensive and complete to enable me to determine fully the characteristics and value of the group, and therefore the propriety or advantageousness of its separation generically.
The forms studied differ from typical Lycosas among other features in having the epigyna as \\\(\q as or wider than long with the guide more or less strongly arched at middle, and with the lateral depression, relativel}^ wide and short, tending to subcircular; the lateral ridges commonly low at middle (PI.
XX, fig.
2. avara; PI.
XX, fig.
6, cinerea).
In the male palpal organ the proximal limb of scopus is more strongl}developed, being more or less elongate and bent out vertically as a conspicuously salient process (PI.
XX, fig.
1, avara).
Some but not all species in the group have the stout spine, normally present alcove at proximal end of the tibiae of the third and fourth legs in Lycosa, replaced by a very elongate, basally stout bristle clearly stouter at base than surrounding haii"s, spine-like, but distally gradually extending into a long fine awn.
Through some forms of this group a close approach is made to Allocosa, which may ultimately have to be withdrawn into the present genus.

One of the commonest and most widely distributed species, which is subject to much variation in size and in depth of coloration.
Because of the abundance of this species it will be well to indicate the color differences presented by partly grown individuals.
These have the sternum yellow with a narrow black stripe each side of middle line, the two converging and uniting in front of posterior margin, and also a row of small black dots along each lateral margin; the legs with numerous annulations which are present on all joints except tarsi, with sometimes indications of a median one on these; cephalothorax and abdomen above nearly as in adults; venter yellow with black dots minute.
The female L. nidicola builds a shallow excavation or nest under logs and stones along roadsides and in the woods.
She hues the nest with silk and often surrounds it with a low rampart of earth or of sticks and leaves.
They are frequently met with in these nests with their cocoons in early summer.

So far as I have determined, tibia + patella of fourth legs of the male in Eastern specimens of helluo is longer than tibia + patella of first pair or sometimes, iii large specimens, of the same length, whereas the reverse is seen to be true in grandis.
But as the relative lengths of these two pairs of joints varies in helluo and apparently with the size of the individual, the increased relative length of tibia + patella of the first pair, and in fact of the entire first leg, may not be of much significance.
The agreement between helluo and grandis is thus close excepting in color and size, and it might therefore be more proper to place the latter as a variety under the former.

It seems very probable that Hentz, in his notes on habits, has conf oimded two species under the name fatifera ; but the description and the figure which he gives can hardly be applicable to any other species than the one under consideration.
The description and figure indicate a form without distinct markings, and his statement that a "piceous variety is found in Alabama, with the two first joints of the legs pectus and abdomen yellowish underneath, or lighter in color," applies perfectly to some specimens of the form above described which I have from this same locality, and which is very common there and must have been well known to Hentz.
This form fits only his description of fatifera among all treated by him.
The species which Hentz observed living in holes in Massachusetts, and which he says is common there, may have been L. aspersa {inhonesta), as has been suggested by Banks, but far more likely it was arenicola, the common turret builder of that region.
Hentz says: "Cheliceres covered with rufous hairs," which is not so in most specimens of aspersa.
The strong markings of aspersa would not have been passed over.
However, Hentz would seem to have written his description after he had been in the South and away from Massachusetts for many years, and doubtless had before him only the Southern form, which he erroneously supposed to be the same as the turret builder he recalled as common in Massachusetts.
Old and rubbed specimens of arenicola might appear similar, as the markings in this form are due to color of the hair.
Whatever Northern form it was the habits of which Hentz had in mind, it was long ago separated under another name, and this common and widespread Southern form which Hentz undoubtedly described as and called fatifera must logically continue to bear this name.
The species has been found abundant in the ''sandy waters bordering the lower end of Lake Michigan" by Mr. J. C. Hancock ('99) who says : "Patches of high grass, sedges and ragweeds made the open lay of ground a paradise of running spiders.
Here it was the castle-building species [termed by him domifex] seemed perfectly at home, showing its varied accomplishments to best advantage.
The artfully-hidden castle is not apparent to the uninitiated while walking over the ground, as it is commonly secreted in a recess of overhanging dried grass When one remembers the average size of the adult castle, only fiveeighths of an inch high and a little over one-half inch in diameter, it is obvious that close inspection is quite essential.
Usually the spider's tube is constructed vertically in the ground, unless obstructions cause some deviations Old spiders live in their burrows for more than a season and often remodel them after being injured by storms.
Younger specimens re-dig outgro^vn burrows, enlarging them as occasion requires Materials used in the construction of the turrets were green and dried grass leaves, dried fine sedges, leaves of foxtail grass, fibrous roots, etc.
Young specimens not infrequently build a perfect httle tower, almost entirely of stones, and one I have in mind had nine such particles made into a compact edifice five millimeters high.
The masonry was exquisitely put up, every stone bearing out true proportions about the central opening of four millimeters diameter.
Silk used as cement held the whole together securely."
The author has found the burrows of this species abundant over grassy stretches on the foothills near Salt Lake City.
In the case of some burrows no turrets are present; but in most cases turrets of dried sticks, grass or earth are found.

It would seem probable that Hentz did not in all cases distinguish this form from his erratica, and that his account applies partly to the latter species.
What he regarded as the typical form, however, was a burrow-making species, although, like carolinensis, etc., found wandering about and hiding under stones, for in his discussions of erratica he says: "This species I formerly supposed to be a variety of L. lenta, but it was always found wandering and never in holes.
I therefore consider it as perfectly distinct, having been often seen running in the grass."
Concerning lenta he remarks: " This common and powerful species is found wandering in fields, attacking and subduing very large insects.
The female carries her young on her back, which gives her a horrible appearance.
If caught or wounded the little ones escape rapidly in all directions; but the mother is faithful to her duties and defends her progeny while life endures.
It hides under stones^ logs, etc."

Our largest Lycosa, much resembling in its large size and in coloration the famous Tarcntula of southern Europe and its close allies.
Specimens from the Southwest often differ from the typical form in having the venter in part pale as above described.
"This spider has the same habits as L. fatijera, making deep excavations in the ground.
It is frequently found under stones, and possibly it is in such places, nearer the surface, that the eggs are hatched.
The female carries her young on her back, presenting a hideous aspect, being then apparently covered with animated warts.
The little monsters have the instinct, if the mother is much disturbed, to escape and scatter in all directions.
The male, not unfrequently of an enormous size, is often found wandering in October and November in Alabama, and sometimes enters houses" (Hentz), Concerning its habits in New England, Emerton says: "This species digs a hole six or eight inches deep, but is often found under stones or running in fields and occasionally in houses all over New England."
This species is common in Utah, where the males are frequently seen wandering in the open or hiding under stones.
The females dig deep burrows which are sometimes surmounted with turrets, but not so commonly so as in the case of fatijera, Lycosa coloradensis Banks, 1894.

I do not think there is room for doubt that the species above described is the real erratica of Hentz, when one considers the abdominal markings shown in his figure, in connection with his comments on habits and the localities where he found it common.
Hentz says concerning this species that it "was always found wandering and never in holes; .... it was often seen, generally running in the grass."
This is a very common and widely distributed species, found under stones and logs in the woods and especially in grassy meadows.
It is subject to much variation in size, though its characteristic markings are rarely missed.

Hentz remarks as follows concerning Lycosa scutulata after his original description: "This common and very distinct species attains a very large stature.
It is most commonly found wandering in quest of prey The cocoon is very large, spherical and whitish, containing from 150 to 200 eggs, which hatch before the cocoon is opened.
The yellow spots on the abdomen seem to be wanting in the young" {Sj).

From a study of specimens from various places in the West, I am convinced that the species described by Thorell from Colorado as Tarentula modesta is the same as the Eastern L. frondicola, and Thorell's name would have to be used except that it is preoccupied by Keyserling's species.
In 1890 Marx proposed the name pudens to take the place of modesta; but as the species had been described by Emerton in 1885 as frondicola, the latter name must stand.
A study of the male specimen upon which L. nigroventris was based convinces me that it is the same as frondicola.
L. frondicola is a widely distributed species, conmion especially in the central, northern and mountainous parts of the United States.
It is found most frequently in and at the edges of woods, among fallen leaves and sticks.
Specimens from the dryer parts of the West, as with various other species, show a tendency to lose the dark coloration, especially that of the venter.
Some specimens have the venter entirely pale.

Types in collection of Dr. Koch.
A strongly marked and widely distributed species which, as might be expected, is subject to some variations in size and coloration.
The epigynum and the peculiar palpus of the male are constant in essential features and at once reveal the species beneath more superficial differences.
The pattern of the markings on the legs, the cephalothorax and of the dorsum of abdomen remain pretty nearly the same alwa3's except as to depth and distinctness of the colors.
The venter of the abdomen becomes dark or even black with age, the entire animal also then taking on a darker color.

Cephalothorax arched convexly behind, strongly attenuated anteriorly ; pars cephalica narrow and inclined anteriorly, rather low; face with sides convex and sloping outward from above below; posterior eyes seen from above well removed from sides of pars cephalica.
General appearance of cephalothorax much like that of a Drassid.
In the known species the cephalothorax is entirely without distinct pale stripes, or with a median paler band weakly contrasting.
Chelicerce rather weak ; lower margin of furrow armed with three teeth, the superior with two.
Legs short; posterior tarsi simply setose, and the anterior either entirely setose or with sparse lines of scopular hairs at the sides.
Excepting as to curvature of the anterior row of eyes, this genus is much like most species of Simon's old genus Tricca, now withdrawn by its author into Lycosa.
It has the same form of cephalothorax and shows the same tendency toward excessive reduction of the spines of the anterior legs, these spines in some species of Tricca being entirely absent from the tibiae (cf.
degesta, infra).
In Tricca the anterior row of eyes is always more or less recurved, while in Allocosa it is at most straight.
This difference may prove not to hold good.
It may become impossible ultimately to maintain this group separate from Lycosa, the American species of which it closely approaches through the Trochosa group.

Only figures were published.
A pale species about 11 mm, long, with very long legs.
The figure of the eyes would seem certainly to prove this species not to be a Lycosa.
The epigynum is not that either of Lycosa or a Pardosa, being like that of some Piratas and much like that of Allocosa {funerea).
The eyes also resemble those of this latter genus, but this form is placed here with much doubt.

Quadrangle of posterior eyes one-fifth as long as the cephalothorax.
Chelicerce long and robust, the upper margin armed as usual with three teeth of which the median one is much stoutest; in the armature of the lower margin of the furrow with four stout teeth the genus resembles Dolomedes; the statement made by Simon that the two middle teeth of the lower margin are longer than the others does not hold for S. floridanus, in which the fourth tooth is distinctly longest; in immature specimens sometimes but three teeth are present on the lower margin.
Legs with the tarsi and metatarsi densely and widely scopulate for their entire lengths from base to apex, the scopulse long; the scopulae of the posterior pairs divided by a median narrow line of bristles; distal joints of legs with long aculeate bristles.
Spiders of large size, in general appearance similar to Lycosa.
Tn the character of the mouth parts they suggest some of the Pisauridce.
In the structure of the spinnerets and in the color markings of the abdomen and especially in habits they show close affinities with the Agelenidce.
The habits of the species of this genus so far as observed are very similar to those of Hippasa and Porrima, the two most closely related genera.
The three genera are all composed of species which are sedentary in habit, building large webs of fine silk with a central funnelshaped tubular retreat, preciseh^ as do the Agelenas and other Agelenidce.
In rushing out to seize their entangled prey they run upon the lower surface of the web.
Like other Lycosidce, however, they suspend their cocoons to the spinnerets where they are maintained constantly, never depositing them upon the web.
They do not desert their webs during the cocooning season.
According to Cambridge, the movements of a Sosippus which he observed upon the Amazon were exceedingly quick, like those of Agelena.
Sosippus is known only from the Americas, having been found in Florida, Lower California, Mexico, Central America and Brazil.
But one species occurs within our limits.
Sosippus floridanus Simon.

" Cephalothorax convex behind, in front long slanting and attenuated, the face rather narrow, oblique and obtuse.
Four anterior eyes subcontiguous, in a gently recurved row, the median at least twice as large as the lateral.
Eyes of the second row moderate, approximate, occupying a transverse space much narrower than the anterior eye row (PI.

Chelicerse rather weak, the inferior margin of the furrow tridentate, liabium longer than wide, attenuated and obtuse.
Legs rather long; the metatarsi and tarsi slender and long, not scopulate; anterior tibiie armed beneath with 5-5 prone spines and the metatarsi with 3-3 similar ones, there being smaller lateral spines" (Simon).
In the character of cephalothorax and eyes this genus is very similar to Tricca and similarly much suggests Allocosa, from which it differs most conspicuously in the armature of the anterior tibiae.
The posterior eyes are situated upon a very oblique plane.
The eyes of the second row are relatively small.
But one species of this genus is known and that by a single specimen {S. spingerE.

Body clothed sparsely with short hairs, in life never cloaking and concealing the tegument as is commonly the case in Pardosa and Lycosa.
Anterior tibite in the female armed beneath with two pairs of spines, respectively basal and submedian in position, never with an apical pair; these spines veiy long and overlapping, much longer than the diameter of the article; rarely with three pairs beneath, the third pair midway between the median pair and the distal end of the joint; tibiae in the male with the long spines as in the female, but in addition with an apical pair (PI.

Cephalothorax moderately low; the pars cephalicanot elevated being nearly level with the dorsal line of the pars thoracica, in front broadly obtusely rounded, the sides rounded and considerably sloping.
Face mostly low, much shorter than the length of the chelicerse, trapeziform, the sides in most convexly rounded and widely sloping, rarely substraight and very steep or nearly vertical, the eyes of second row more or less distant from its upper exterior angles.
Except in the few species with the sides of the face very steep, the posterior eyes when viewed from above are removed from the lateral margins of the pars cephalica by more than their diameter as is the case in Lycosa {PI.
X, fig.
5).
Quadrangle of posterior eyes one-fourth, or usually less, the length of the cephalothorax, rarely longer.
Chelicene robust, the lower margin with three teeth similar to those of Lycosa, but with the third often conspicuouslj^ reduced as in Pardosa; upper margin with three teeth of the usual character ; fringe of hair of upper margin more sparse than in Lycosa; posterior line with long but sparse hairs.
Legs robust; tarsi in most cases simply setose on all pairs, very rarely with the anterior ones with thin lateral scopular lines as in Pardosa, the bristles, however, being often serried (PL X, fig.
7); tibia -1patella of leg IV sometimes longer than, at others shorter than, the cephalothorax, longer than the metatarsus or more rarely of the same length.
The cephalothorax always presents a median pale stripe, which begins on the posterior declivity as a narrow line and then continuously widens to the third eye row, there more abruptly widening, passing below the posterior eyes of each side and attaining the clypeus ; the eyes are mostly upon black; the median stripe encloses in its anterior half a bifurcate or V-shaped dark mark, the undivided median part being at the anterior end of the dorsal furrow and sending an arm forward to the inner margin of the third eye on each side (PI.
X, fig.
5) ; marginal light stripes may or may not be present; many species are marked on the abdomen with lines and spots of bright white hair.
The Piratas are spiders of small or of medium size.
The males are in most cases as large as or larger than the females.
In habits they are much like the Pisauricke.
They occur in damp meadows or more especially at the margins of streams, ponds and other bodies of water, upon which they run with great ease.
Many forms in case of danger dive readily beneath the surface of the water and hide under stones, leaves,, etc., at the bdttom.
The cocoon is carried about attached to the spinnerets, though when the females are at rest it is commonlj^ held in the chelicerse.
The cocoons are clear white in color and spherical in shape, marked at the equator by a seam less strong than that on the cocoons of Pardosa.
The female constructs a temporary retreat under stones and other suitable places, spinning a small irregular web of very delicate texture.
The greater length of the superior spinnerets would seem to be associated with this web-spinning habit.

Although this species was described as a Pardosa, it seems very clear from the structure of the epigynum, as shown in the figure accompanying the original description, taken in connection with several points in the description, that it is a Pirata.
The statement that the pars cephalica is marked with "three lighter bands" indicates the presence of the peculiar Pirata marking of the cephalothorax.

DESCRIPTION OF TRACHYPTERUS SELENIRIS, A NEW SPECIES OF RIBBONFISH FROM MONTEREY BAY, CALIFORNIA.
BY .JOHN OTTERBEIN SNYDER.
Early in June of last year a large Ribbon-fish was found almost stranded on the beach at Monterey, California.
It was secured by Mr. Frederick A.
Wood worth, of Pacific Grove, and through his kindly interest sent to Stanford University for identification.
Its close resemblance to Trachyptcrus ishikawce^ of Japan was at once apparent, but a detailed examination was impossible at that time on account of the decayed condition of the specimen, the delicate silvery skin leaving the body at a touch of the finger, and the muscles almost parting from the bones.
After a long immersion in a mixture of strong alcohol and formalin, it may now be handled without further injury.
When the IVIonterey specimen is compared with the type of Trachypterus ishikaivce, certain differences appear which indicate that we have to deal with two distinct species, one of which, being unknown, is here described as Trachypterus seleniris.
The latter differe from T. ishikawce, the most nearly allied form, in having a more slender body, a smaller head, a smaller eye, and a weaker armature of the body.
The chief differences may be tabulated thus : T. seleniris.

process of maxillary extending to a vertical through posterior border of eye; maxillary with a leaf -like flap a fourth of its length longer than diameter of eye, and with branched striations radiating from its point of attachment; opercular bones conspicuously striated.
Teeth weak; loosely attached ones on vomer, a row of 4 on maxillary, and 4 on each side of symphysis of lower jaw, the posterior of which is 2 times the length of the anterior.
Gill-rakers on first arch 5 -f10, provided with tooth-like setse on the inner side; filaments of pseud obranchise equal in length to those of gills.
Origin of dorsal above upper edge of gill-opening, the rays highest near beginning of posterior third of body where they are about l-J times the diameter of eye; anterior rays not separated from the posterior ones nor lengthened.
Length of pectoral slightly more than diameter of orbit.
A'^entral fins absent, or possibly represented by a mere filament, the place of insertion indicated by a spot on the breast below base of pectoral, where the skin, colored and sculptured, looks much like a pair of folded fins.
Caudal projecting upwards; short fragmentar}'filaments present; several small spines projecting downwards and backwards from the broadened end of the caudal peduncle.
Head naked; scales of body in the form of minute pads or plates containing a varying amount of bony matter; those on median ventral surface pointed, hard and white like enamel, covering a narrow ridge and lying in a single row near extremity of tail; among those on dorsal part of body, some are enlarged and arranged in vertical rows parallel with the interneurals.
Lateral line with small, quill-like tubes; beginning at upper edge of gill-opening, bending rather abruptly downwards and extending along body somewhat below the median line; not armed at any point.
Color bright silvery.

SOME POLYCH^TOUS ANNELIDS OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC COAST OF NORTH AMERICA.
BY J. PERCY MOORE.
This paper is a final report embodying the results of a study of all of the Polychceta submitted to me by the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries from the collections made by the steamer Albatross during the summer of 1903.
I'rom June 19 to August 24 of that year, while in the service of a special Commission appointed by the President to investigate the salmon fisheries of Alaska, the Albatross cruised northward along the coast from Port Townsend and Vancouver on the south, through part of the labyrinth of straits and passages which separate the islands of southeastern Alaska, as far as Shelekof Strait on the north and west, occupying meanwhile 112 dredging stations and a number of additional hydrographic and towing stations.
Some little shore collecting was also conducted.
During the cruise the vessel was under the command of the late Lieut.
Franklin Swift, U.S.N.
, to whose skill in handhng her must be largeh^ credited the large number of successful hauls made with trawl and dredge.
The extent of the collection and the generally excellent preservation of the annelids similarly attest the energy and ability which Prof. Harold Heath devoted to collecting the invertebrates, placed under his immediate charge.
In all 107 species of Polychseta are represented.
Of this number 41 species are considered to be previously und escribed.
The descriptions of only two of these, however, appear for the first time in this paper, the remaining 39 having been published, with the courteous approval of the Commissioner, Hon.
George M. Bowers, in these Proceedings for 1905, pp.
525-569, 846-860, and for 1906, pp.
217-260, together with plates illustrating important diagnostic features.
Supplementing the results of the study of the Albatross collections are added some notes on a few polychsetes in the collection of this Academy, gathered by Dr. Benjamin Sharp at Icy Cape^ and Unalaska, ' The northernmost point of that nnme.
Alaska; by Mr. A. E. Mcllhenny at Point Barrow, Alaska, and by Mr. George Dawson at Admiralty Inlet, Washington.
From this source are added 7 species not otherwise represented, 2 of them having been described as new in these Proceedings for 1906, pp.
352-355.
The total number of species considered is, therefore, 114.
After deducting the 43 new species, the 71 remaining may be classified from the point of view of geographical distribution as follows : 16, so far as known, are confined to the region under consideration, having been reported from some part of it, but not elsewhere, by previous writers; 12 occur to the southward along the coast of California, though most of them have already been recorded from Puget Sound or the Gulf of Georgia by Johnson and others; 8 have been described as occurring off the coast of Japan, and probably all of the latter have, as several are known to have, a wide distribution throughout the North Pacific; 4 are scattering; and the remaining 31 are well-known inhabitants of northern Europe, Greenland and the Arctic regions generall5^ Many of the latter are established circumpolar forms and have been already reported by Marenzeller or Wiren as belonging to the fauna of Bering Sea, or by others as occurring in the North Pacific.
In not a few cases it is evident that the individuals referred to such species differ in certain respects from their European representatives.
In a few species like TerebelUdes strcemii individuals of almost every colony present certain characteristic differences.
In the belief that the future will show that such wide-ranging species split up into man)'geographical subspecies just as land animals do, and that such subspecies cannot be satisfactorily discriminated until our knowledge of the distribution and variation of annelids shall have been very greatly augmented, it has been thought best to merely mention such differences, without giving to them nomenclatorial importance.
In this report it has been thought sufficient to the purpose to record only the general location of the stations, together with the depth of water and the character of the bottom.
The full data relating to each station, including its exact location, have been carefully compiled by Mr. Henry C. Fassett and published in the Report of the U. S. Fish Commission for 1903, pp.
123 to 13S.
Except in the two or three cases where it is stated otherwise, all types have been forwarded to the U. S. National Museum.
Cotypes, whenever such exist, are deposited at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
The references given under each species are either to its original description or to later accounts fiu'iiished with good figures and synonymies.

Two small and immature examples 11 imn.
long agree well with the descriptions cited above and bear out fully Marenzeller's conclusions concerning the synonymy of the species and confirm his record of its occurrence in Bering Sea, One specimen is beautifully marked with dainty transverse lines of dark brown or black pigment; there being two lines across each segment as far as XV and beyond that point one line to the middle of the body.
The accessory tooth at the tip of the setae, which was overlooked by Malmgren, is almost always present.
The median tentacle has 15 joints, the paired tentacles 11 to 14 joints, the dorsal and ventral peristomial cirri 15 and 10 respectively^, the first dorsal cirrus (somite II) 18 joints, the middle dorsal cirri 9 to 14 joints, with the greatest diameter at the 4th or 5th, and the caudal cirri 14 joints.
In one specimen the gizzard extends from somite XIII to XXII.

The type and largest example (from Station 4228) is 30 mm, long with 160 segments, the posterior 28 of which are filled with eggsi without, however, exhibiting any sign of stolonization.
Other examples are from 16 to 20 mm.
long with from 116 to 125 segments.
The form is slender and the diameter nearly uniform, the body slightly widened to about XX, strongly arched above and flattened below.
The segments are all sharply defined and very short, usually 6 to 8 times as wide as long.
The prostomium (a) is about H times as wide as long, as shown in the figure of a cotype, but may be partly concealed beneath a fold of the peristomium.
Slight anterior and posterior contractions give the effect of prominently bulging sides.
The palpi are about twice the length of the prostomium, project prominently straight forward and are narrow distally.
Of the two pairs of small reddish-brown eyes, the anterior are larger, decidedly farther apart and crescentic or beanshaped as seen from above.
In the type specimen the two pairs of eyes are closer together but riot larger than in the smaller specimens.
324 [June^ All of the appendages are strongly moniliform.
The tentacles are rather stout but gently tapered.
The median arises between the eyes, is nearly twice the length of prostomiuni and palpi and consists of 22 to 30 joints.
The lateral tentacles arise from the antero-lateral face of the prostomiuni, are H times as long as the latter plus the palps and consist of about 20 joints.
The perjstomial cirri are quite similar in form, the dorsal consisting of about 20 to 25 joints and equalhng the median tentacle and the ventral consisting of 15 joints and equalling Syllis alternata â€” a, cephalic region from above, X 24; 6, parapodium X, X 32; c, parapodium LI, X 32; d, a moderately long-bladed seta from the dorsal part of parapodium X, X 600; e, a short-bladed seta from the ventral part of the same, X 600; /, ends of two acicula, X 600. the lateral tentacle in length.
The first dorsal cirrus is very long, especially on the type, in which it has about 35 joints.
â€¢ The parapodia (6 and c) are rather stout and short, blunt and broadly roimded distally.
Ventral cirri are slender, unjointed, little tapered and reach beyond the end of the neuropodium.
The dorsal cirri, on the other hand, are all very strongly moniliform and gently tapered throughout.
They are longest and nearly uniform on the anterior 15 segments, on which they nearly equal the diameter of the body.
Farther back they are alternately long and short, but never equal to the anterior ones.
From about 25 and 18 respectively in this region the number of joints becomes reduced at the caudal end quite rapidly until on the last but one remains.
In the several specimens the caudal cirri have from 16 to 25 joints.
No notopodial aciculum is present, but there are usually 3 neuropodials (/) with knobbed ends of various forms.
The neuropodial setae usually number about 10, disposed in 3 or 4 ranks.
They are colorless, homogeneous, and rather milky vitreous in appearance.
The rather stout stems have 4 or 5 minute teeth on the convexity of the enlarged ends (d and e) which are strongly oblique and possess a well-developed socket.
The appended blades of the dorsalmost setae (d) are quite long, some of those of the anterior segments exceeding by ^ the one figured.
The ventral and posterior ones are shorter (e), and some of the shortest are claw-like and little exceed the obliquity of the end of the shaft in length.
The end is strongly hooked, the accessory tooth well developeti , and the marginal fringe very fine.
In one specimen the protruded proboscis is a short and nearly cylindrical cup bearing 10 prominent soft marginal papillse.
In another the gizzard lies in somites IX to XXI, in still another in XIX to XXXVII.
The cuticle of this species is noticeably thick.
No trace whatever of color remains.

This large and handsome syllid is represented by two specimens, one (the type) coming from Station 4219, Admiralty Inlet, vicinity of Port Townsend, Washington, 16-26 fathoms, green mud, sand and broken shells; the other from Station 4244, Kasaan Bay, Prince of Wales Island, southeastern Alaska, 50-54 fathoms, green mud.
Pionosyllis gigantea new species.
Three fragments of the anterior end, the largest comprising but 40 326 [June, segments, represent a species much larger than P. magnifica, from which it is distinguished by numerous characters.
The type, consisting of 40 segments, is 16 mm.
long, 4 mm.
in width of body and 7 mm.
between the tips of the setse.
The prostomium is nearly quadrate but slightly wider anteriorly, where the angles are rounded ; it is quite deeply cut into two lobes by a median cleft posteriorly.
The palpi are broad, flattened, broadly rounded at the ends and slightly exceed the prostomium in length ; at the base they are coalesced but diverge widely and curve ventrad distally.
The eyes of both pairs are reddish brown, small and round, the anterior very little larger than the posterior and directly in front of them or but little farther apart.
The dorsal cephalic appendages are imperfect on all of the specimens, but are evidently slender, tapering, smooth and flagelliform.
The middle tentacle is apparently about S\ times and the lateral tentacles about twice the length of the prostomium and palpi.
The former arises PlonosylUs gigantea â€” a, parapodium XXV, without setse, X 24; b, parapoclium L, without setae, X 24; c, a seta Avith blade of average length, from XXV, X 360. from the center of the prostomium, the latter from the anterior lateral margins.
The very short, slightly flaring proboscis bears 9 or 10 marginal papillse and apparently is unprovided with a strongly cuticular region.
The peristomium is extremely short above, where it is represented chiefly by a fold of integument which conceals the posterior lobes of the prostomium.
At the sides it is better developed and ventrally is crowded forward with the next two segments beneath the prostomium.
Its tentacular cirri are similar to the prostomial appendages, the dorsal 327 about 5 times the length of the head and the ventral only about twice that length.
Remaining somites are very short anteriorly, but from the twentieth onward are only 6 or 7 times as wide as long.
Dorsally they are strongly arched, ventrally flattened.
The intersegmental furrows are well marked, perhaps exaggerated by contraction of the longitudinal muscles.
All of the parapodia (a and h) are prominent and spring from the lowest level of the sides of the body.
Notopodia are entirely wanting, even the acicula appearing to be absent.
The neuropodia, on the other hand, are stout, those at the anterior end being nearly truncated, while the more posterior ones are bevelled from the dorsal or acicular angle.
All, however, possess slender and prominent presetal papillse at this angle.
Ventral cirri are remarkably large and swollen on the anterior parapodia and end bluntly, but farther back they become reduced in size and more slender and an annular constriction may separate the pointed end as a separate piece.
The most striking characteristic of the species is the great length of the anterior dorsal cirri which form a tangled mass at the sides of the body; they are so easily detached that few of them remain.
They arise from rather stout but short cirrophores (a) which are not sharply distinguished from the sides of the somites.
The styles are smooth, tapering and very slender toward the end, like whiplashes.
On one of the smaller specimens, which has 29 segments measuring 8 mm.
long, and a maximum body width of 3 mm., the dorsal cirrus of somite IV measures no less than 14 mm.
long.
The cirri are alternately longer and shorter, and after about the first ten those borne on the even numbered somites are regularly 2 to 2^ times the body width, while those on the odd numbered somites little exceed the body width.
Neuropodia are supported by 5 or 6 acicula which taper gradually almost to the end, where they are slightly curved and end abruptly in short conical points.
The setae (c) project rather prominently in usually 5 subacicular ranks of 3 or 4 each.
In any one parapodium they are remarkably uniform in length of blade, etc., but the blades become gradually shorter and wider and the shafts stouter from before backwards.
The shaft (c) exhibits but a slight distal enlargement, but is conspicuously and very unequally bifid, the larger and longer process ending quite acutely and being provided along the front with 4 or 5 obscure teeth.
The blades or appendages are rather long, strongly hooked and bifid at the end, and especially noteworthy for the coarseness of their marginal serrations.
With the exception of the prostomium and the dorsal cirri these annelids are much pigmented both above and below with chocolate brown.

This species is represented in the collection by two specimens.
As one of them permits the verification of Johnson's very interesting discovery of collateral budding in this genus, it is unfortunate that the preservation is altogether too imperfect to enable me to describe the conditions fully.
The buds are all quite young and occur in several close tufts arranged in a transverse row about 35 segments anterior to the anus, and all on the ventral surface, where the integuments are split open at their place of origin.
Collateral budding of a type similar to that described by Johnson in T. geinmipara and T. nigens has recently been found by Tzuka in a Japanese species, T. misakiensis, also.
Taken only at Station 4197, Gulf of Georgia, Halibut Bank, 31-90 fathoms, sticky green mud and fine sand.

It was taken from the interior of a large vase-shaped sponge, and according to the label the color during life was "creamy white changing to pinkish along dorsal surface."
Dr. Heath tells me that on the living worm the elytra were very easily detached and not coherent as after preservation; though of gelatinous consistency they were very brittle.

Single specimens of this interesting species were taken at several Alaskan localities.
A few notopodial setse usually occur on most of the parapodia.
The specimens vary much in color, some being colorless, others with the elytra more or less completely speckled with brown, and one, found living commensally on a holothurian, is recorded on the label as having been poppy red on the dorsal surface, lighter beneath.
The cephalic appendages may possess a filamentous distal part.

This species, originally described from specimens dredged off the coast of Japan, proves to be one of the most abundant and generally distributed species of Polychaeta throughout the region covered by these explorations.
It represents in the North Pacific the widely spread L. squamatus of the Atlantic, but is quite distinct from that species.
The detached submarginal t\ift of cilia that is so conspicuous and constant a feature on the elytra of the latter species is quite absent in the former, in which, also, the marginal flask-shaped sense organs are very much fewer and smaller.
The outer surface of the elytra is less hairy and beat's more numerous and rather smoother papillae.
]\Iuch variation is evident in the size, number, arrangement and sculpturing of the papilla?
and in the color of the elytra, some specimens being nearly black, others reddish brown, and still others orange or yellow.
The neuropodial setse are quite distinct from those of L. squamatus, being more slender, less strongly hooked, more extensively ctenate and in a greater number of rows.
All of these differences are most apparent in the adults, especially when individuals of equal size are compared.
The young of L. cccloris much more closely resemble the Atlantic species, especially in the greater hairiness of the elytra, and it seems not improbable that the small specimens of L. squamatus recorded by Johnson from Puget Soimd and California and by Marenzeller from Japan may be of this species.
It is also not improbable that intermediate forms may be found to connect the two in the Arctic regions, in which case L. cantoris would become a well-marked subspecies.
Represented in the collections by a greater number of individuals than any other species, Lepidonotus caloris was found at many points between Vancouver and Kadiak Islands, at depths ranging from 18 to 313 fathoms and on most kinds of bottom, though naturally most often on mud.
It was most abundant on muddy bottoms in the Gulf of Georgia, on a gravelly bottom with sponges at Station 4228, near Naha Bay in the Behm Canal, and on a bottom of rock and broken shells at Station 4253 in Stephens Passage, Alaska.
The stations at which Lepidonotus c(eloris was taken are 4192, 4193, 4197, 4198, 4227, 4228, 4234, 4235, 4239, 4245, 4253, 4258 and 4274.

Three complete examples from near Port Townsend alone represent this most interesting commensalistic species.
The margins of the elytra are frequently more complexly folded than is indicated by Johnson.

It is stated that the specimens Avere taken from Asterias sp.

This species was originally described from the anterior end of a specimen in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, at that time supposed to have been collected in Greenland, but now believed to have been taken by Dr. Benjamin Sharp at Icy Cape, Alaska.
It is well represented in this collection from the more southern stations.
The completeness of some of the examples permits the addition of the following notes to the original description.
A length of 80 mm.
is attained, the posterior region of the body being slender and tapering.
There are 63 segments with 15 pairs of elytra, borne on segments II, IV, V, VII, IX, XI, XIII, XV, XVII, XIX, XXI, XXIII, XXVI, XXIX and XXXII, and leaving the posterior part of the body unprotected except by the bristling setse.
The cephalic peaks are rudimentary, being coalesced with the bases of the lateral tentacles, and the anterior eyes are farther forward than in the type.
The style of the median tentacle is slender, about twice the length of the prostomium and has a scarcely perceptible subterminal enlargement.
The lateral tentacles are very short, the short, conical styles with their terminal filaments scarcely exceeding the ceratophores.
The extended palpi taper regularly to the end, are slender and 7-8 times the prostomial length.
Anterior elytra are circular, the others broadly elliptical, with weak attachment laterad of the center.
Their texture is soft and flexible, the surface smooth and punctate and entirely lacking cilia or papillae of any sort, but with the margin slightly thickened anrl upturned.
The inner half is brown, the outer wliite in agreement with the color of the body.
Dorsal cirri are rather stout with prominent cirrophores and the styles reach beyond the tips of the parapodia.
They taper regularly to a subterminal enlargement, beyond which is a short filament.
Posterior cirri are longer and more slender and the anal cirri are stouter and very long, equalling the last 9 somites.
Usually but one anal cirrus is fully developed.
A broad rich brown stripe marks the dorsum, being more or less broken in the middle of the body and spreading over the entire back posteriorly where a median white line sometimes divides it.
Dorsal cephalic appendages and dorsal cirri chiefly brown with subterminal and terminal white rings All other parts, including entire venter, white.

Besides a fragment labelled Union Bay, B.
C, 6-22-'03, this species is represented by specimens from Stations 4261 (type), Dundas Bay, Icy Strait, 8^10 fathoms, green mud and rocks; 4270, Afognak Bay, Afognak Island, Alaska, 14-1 9 fathoms, hard gray sand and rock.
The latter is labelled ''Hermit crab, messmate," and many of the papillae on the elytra bear 2 or 3 spines.
I also refer provisionally to this species under the name of var.
mammillata a specimen which may represent a distinct but related species.
It measures 20 mm.
long and has a form similar to but somewhat less broad and depressed than typical depressa.
The palpi are 22 barely twice the length of the prostoniium, but the other cephalic appendages are longer and much more slender than in the typical form.
The median tentacle is about 3J times and the lateral tentacles nearly If times the length of the prostomiimi.
The cirrophores of the dorsal cirri reach to the end of the notopodia and the slender styles possess long fihform tips which reach to the tips of the longest seta\ The elytra are thimier and more membranous and their shape more ovate-reniform.
They also have larger, firmer, and more mammilif orm papillffi.
But the chief distinction is a strong fringe of cilia along the outer margin of each of the elytra.
The general color is reddish brown and the elytra bluish pearl with the larger papillae orange brown.
The label states that this specimen was taken from the branchial chamber of an 11-pound crab.

long and most of them much smaller.
They present the usual color varieties seen in Atlantic Coast specimens, some being more or less strongly mottled, others having a median light or dark brown band of greater or less breadth.
The marginal papillae on the elytra may be numerous or nearly absent.

This is another species which was originally incorrectly attributed to Greenland, the type locality being almost certainly Icy Cape, Alaska.
Like Hermadioa truncata it is rather plentiful in the collections from the Gulf of Georgia to Behm Canal, being represented, mostly by fragmentary specimens, in the collections from the following : Stations 4193, Halibut Bank, Gulf of Georgia, B.
C, 18-23 fathoms, green mud and fine sand; 4194, same region, 111-170 fathoms, soft green nuid; 4197, same region, 31-90 fathoms, sticky green mud and fine sand; 4199, Queen Charlotte Sound, off Fort Rupert, Vancouver Island, B.

The species appears to be especially common at the last enumerated station and several fragments taken here depart quite widely from the typical form in the character of the elytra.
These are designated as variety papillata, characterized as follows : The elytra bear more numerous, larger and differently shaped soft papillae and very much fewer and smaller hard conical papillae; and instead of the numerous long cilia on the exposed surface and near the outer margin of the elytra of the typical form, these bear only a few very much shorter cilia with thickened ends.

^ Â» .FOccurring quite plentifully in the collections from the more northerly points in the Alaskan Gulf, where it apparently largely replaces L. multisetosa, this species is represented by two varieties which are, however, connected by intermediates and apparently occur indiscriminately together at the same stations.
The difference is in the presence or absence of the soft marginal papillae on the elytra.
On some examples these are very numerous, especially on anterior elytra, and have exactly the elongated form and the arrangement exhibited by typical representatives of the species from Greenland and other North Atlantic localities.
Others have perfectly smooth elytra, altogether lacking these appendages.
Between these two extreme categories, into which most of the specimens fall, are some individuals intermediate in either the number or size of the appendages or in both.
Some have the papilhB very short and present on many elytra and others very few papillae of normal or reduced size.
One bears a single papillse on one elytron and another half a dozen papillae distributed among three elytra.

This species, the type of which came from Icy Cape and is in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences, appears to be quite plentiful on the muddy bottoms of the Gulf of Georgia and equally so on a gravelly bottom at Station 4228 in Behm Canal.
Most of the examples have lost most of the elytra and are otherwise mutilated, but one specimen permits the description of the posterior elytra which were lacking on the type.
They are nearly circular in outline and of smaller size and softer texture than the anterior elytra, but the most striking difference is in the very great length of the terminal branches of the dendritic spines of the posterior margin, the number of forkings of which is, however, less than on anterior scales.

Single examples of this curious little polychffite occur at three rather widely separated stations.
The elytra are very stiff and rigid, apparently due to a hard brownish secretion which is deposited in layers, thus giving the appearance of concentric lines of gro\\i:h. Sand grains adhere to and become imbedded in this substance, especially along the ridge of the scale.
This same secretion renders the body brittle, but no sand grains are borne on this region of these specimens.
The hairs of the marginal fringes are very unequal, the longest being as much as ^ of the long diameter of the scale.
Many of the elytra are marked with dark brown central spots.

From the Gulf of Georgia to the head of Behm Canal this species is common and especially so wherever muddy bottoms occur.
These specimens differ in no respect from those taken in the Albatross dredgings off the coast of Japan in 1900.
The neuropodial setae are unusually prominent and slender and when young their tips are incased in a densely hairy sheath, which later wears away, leaving the point smooth.
The notopodial setae are completely imbedded in the felt and are seldom visible.
They are slender, soft, curved, pale brown, roughened toward the end and have the tip hooked.
Generally the color is very dark â€” almost black â€” and the felt is dull, probably the result of staining by some constituent of the mud in which they live.
The palpi are white.
The specimens vary in length from 14 to 80 mm.

A small individual 10 mm.
long is believed to represent this species, the original description of which was based upon a probably imperfect and much contracted specimen.
There are, however, some points of difference between the two specimens, as the following brief description indicates.
The form is strongly depressed, about equally rounded anteriorly and posteriorly, the somites munbering 21, strongly marked and well developed throughout.
The subanal lobes or cirri are large, thick and fleshy.
The dorsal smooth field is about \ the entire width and not subdivided into areas.
A black spot or group of spots occurs on the posterior part of each segment behind the second gill.
The caruncle is short and broad , reaching from the anterior margin of II to the posterior margin of IV, and consists entirely of a rather high, thick crest, little free behind.
The median tentacle equals the caruncle in length and the stout basal article, which furnishes | of its length, nearly equals the caruncle in thickness.
The terminal piece is filamentous.
The dorsal eyes are very large, elongated and black.
The ventral eyes are coalesced and the ventral paired tentacles minute.
The dorsal cirri are very long, much exceeding the length of the caruncle, slender and tapered.
The median cirrus arises between the second and third gills and, like the ventral cirrus, is stouter than tlie dorsal cirrus and equally long.
Five pairs of gills occur on the middle region.
They are arbusculate and spreading, with some 30 or more slender, lanceolate terminal twigs formed by as many as 5 or 6 irregular dichotomous divisions.
The setae agree exactly with Johnson's figures.

The addition of this species to the list of Alaskan poly chutes becomes possible through the study of the contents of salmon stomachs submitted by Dr. H. M. Smith.
The salmon were taken at Yes Bay, Alaska, on July 27 and 28, 1905, and contained a large number of remains.
Many of the worms were already completely disintegrated^ but the anterior ends of some were sufficiently intact to remove any reasonable doubt of the correctness of this identification.
The only respect in which they differ from the published descriptions is in the presence of as many as 4 stout setae in the first parapodium (somite IV).
A noteworthy characteristic of the species is the considerable length of the cirriform appendage of the parapodia.
Anteriorly the dorsum is a diluted chocolate brown, the surface of the eye cups, the prostomium and a transverse band across each segment being still darker.
A brown spot at the base of each dorsal cirrus appears to continue for the entire length of the body.
The large numbers in which these worms occur in the salmon stomachs and the evidences that they were filled with sperm and ova indicates that at sexual maturity they must swim in great shoals at the surface.
Originally described by Kinberg from the China Sea, this species has since been twice taken in the Atlantic Ocean, but until now has not been reported from the Pacific.

The maximum raunber of branchial pinnae exhibited by different specimens varies from 5 to 8 according to the size, and the gills begin on V or VI and end at from XLV to LVIII.
The characters of the setae and acicula are very constant and differ in no respect from those assigned to Eunice kobiensis.
On the other hand the ja^vs vary considerably and the large paired plates may exhibit a number of teeth either greater or less than is shown in Mcintosh's figure.
The cephalic appendages generally average shorter and the peristomium longer than on the Japanese specimens, and the ventral cirri are larger than is usual in this genus.

A species of Lumbrineris widely and generally distributed over the field covered by these explorations is assigned with much hesitation as above.
The variability of the jaws and the form of the prostomium in species of this genus, taken with the fact that the exact region from which the parapodia described or figured for many species have been selected is often not indicated, renders identification of representatives of this genus very difficult.
The smaller examples resemble L. heteropoda in every respect, but the larger ones have the prostomium shorter and more broadly rounded; the jaws vary in respect to the form and number of teeth on the individual plates and probably in a greater divergence of the lobes of the posterior parapodia.
The j^resence of a tuft of very long slender winged seta?
in the lower part of the supraacicular tuft of the middle parapodia of some specimens is also a noteworthy character which may indicate specific separation from L. heteropoda.

The divisions of the branchiae are often longer than figured by Johnson, whose figure of the uncinus also is somewhat foreshortened.
The number of setigerous somites is constantly 17, as stated by Johnson.
Some of the specimens bear short cirri or papillae beneath the setas of some of the anterior segments.
This is probably a secondary sex character, but this could not be ascertained with certainty.

The original description is based upon a single specimen which was stated to have no eyes.
All of several specimens in the present collection possess very numerous deep brown eyes arranged in a compact narrow band on eacli side, with a dorsal interval equal to the interbranchial space and a longer ventral interval.
These eyes are ordinarily concealed by the inrolled margin of the prostomial fold.
The inequality of the gills seems to be a constant character and the number of setigerous segments is 17, as stated by Johnson.
Part of a tube is covered with small pebbles, sea-urchin spines, bits of eel grass, etc.
None of the specimens was found near the type locality in Puget Sound, but all in Alaskan waters at the following stations: 4228, vicinity of Naha Bay, Behm Canal, southeastern Alaska, 41-134 fathoms, gravel and sponge; 4259, Dundas Bay, Icy Strait, 21-78 fathoms, gray sand, broken shell and rock; 4283 Chignik Bay, 30-41 fathoms, black sand and brown sponge; 4289, Uyak Bay, Kadiak Island, 74-80 fathoms, gray mud, Pista cristata (MuUer) Malmgren.

The single example of Pista referred to this species agrees with those dredged by the Albatross off the coast of Japan, and differs from P. cristata as described by European authors in having the upper free angle of the lateral subbranchial membrane of IV much more produced and prominent, quite equalling that of III.
Otherwise they agree, so far as can be ascertained, in all features.
The handles of the uncini on V are longer than the others, but there is no other difference.

202-204.
Concerning the reference of the fine species of Pista found at several stations in southeastern Alaska to the above named, I am in much doubt.
Grube's description of Terehella fasciata is not sufficiently precise for certain determination, but the excellent accounts and figures given by Marenzeller and Mcintosh seem to me to refer to different species.
In any event the figure of the branchiae given by the latter would not answer for these specimens, as the terminal twigs are much more spreading and uneven.
About 3 or 4 main branches spring from the trunk, and these immedia.tely branch and rebranch asymmetrically 8 or 10 times, the main stem being always recognizable, but bending at each point of branching and tapering continuously to the end.
Usually 3 gills are well developed, and 1 is either very small and entirely without branches or may be altogether wanting.
Which are well developed appears to be quite accidental.
They may be the two of a pair, or the two of one side, or the left of one and right of the other pair.
All of the specimens exhibit the great flaring wings so well shown in Mcintosh's figure, and there is a distinct postbranchial fold across the dorsum of IV.
The cirri above and behind the setae bundles of VI and VII are well developed.
In respect to most of their characters the uncini resemble Mcintosh's figure closer than those given by Marenzeller, but the former fails to show the guard.
Although none of the specimens is complete, upwards of 100 segments are present, and even incomplete examples measure 160 mm.
long and 6 mm.
wide across the thorax, being therefore much larger than Marenzeller's specimen.
The tube has a thick wall composed of fine silt.
The one from Station 4246 is filled with eggs.

Terebellides strcemi Sars.
TerebeUides straimii Sars, Beskrivelser og lagthagelser, etc., 1835, p. 48.
The proper discrimination of the species of TerebeUides is still a desideratum.
While in their more obvious characters the species are very constant, in respect to others they vary greatly.
The representatives of the genus found in this collection are in most respects indistinguishable from the widely distributed T. strcemii as described by European writers.
On the other hand the transitional setie of somite VIII and the abdominal uncini present slight but quite obvious differences at nearly every station.
It seems probable that this species as usually recognized includes a large number of subspecies.
The bent setae of VIII vary in the length and shape of the bent limb.
The uncini usually have 5 teeth in the series above and surrounding the beak; surmounting these is a second row of 3 smaller teeth, and crowning all a single still smaller median tooth.
The latter varies in size and in distinctness from the median tooth of the row below, with which it is more or less coalesced; it may even be wanting entirely.
The most distinct form occurs on a large example from Station 4247, in which all of the abdominal uncini examined have the median teeth of the second and third rows completely coalesced and that of the first row altogether absent, leaving a gap.
The result is that the beak and one nearly equally large tooth occupy the middle line and a large tooth flanked by a smaller one lies on each side of the gap.
Most of the specimens are filled with eggs or sperm.

All of the AmphictenidsB in the collection belong to one species whichis clearly distinct from any of those hitherto recorded in the Pacific.
While closely resembling P. auricoma in nearly every respect, there are some points of distinction between these and European examples which may require their eventual specific or subspecific separation.
The margin of the cephaUc membrane is more obscurely and much more irregularly dentate; the uncini usually have 5 large teeth, and the series of fine teeth on the inferior process is not continued on to the upper part of the process beneath the lower large tooth; the scapha hooks are never as completely circular at the end as figured for European specimens.
The paleoli are always 12.
In the smaller specimens they have rather long slender tips which wear away, leaving the ends blunt or, in the case of the lateral ones, somewhat pointed.

These specimens agree exactly with those taken by the Albatross off Japan.
Compared with typical examples of the species from the Mediterranean, they appear to have both the cephalic and caudal seta?
more slender, and the shorter setae of the latter region much less hairy.
This appears to be due to the hairs having been rubbed off, but may possibly be a normal and constant difference.
The form of the caudal plate and branchial area agrees with Marenzeller's figures.

As Johnson remarks, the Sternaspis from the neighborhood of Vancouver Island agrees in all respects with specimens from the Atlantic Coast.
Stimpson's S. affinis from Puget Sound is with little doubt to be considered a synonym.
It is noticeable that the lateral angles of the shield plate become more prominent on examples from the more southern stations.
As represented in this collection this species attains a considerably larger size than the last, some of the specimens being 25 mm.
long and 9 mm.
in diameter.

This point I hope to clear up later.
The tubes, formed of agglutinated sand grains, are remarkable for their strength and hardness, and are found singly or in small clumps attached to stones.
Specimens were taken at the following stations : 4220 (type), Admiralty Inlet, near Port Townsend, Washington, 16-31 fathoms, green mud, sand and broken shells; 4247, Prince of Wales Island, 89114 fathoms, green mud with sand and broken shells; 4274, Kadiak Island, 35-41 fathoms, green mud and fine sand; 4288, Uyak Bay, Kadiak Island, 67-^9 fathoms, gray mud.

A small complete specimen bears 18 pairs of gills, the left dorsalmost one of which is enlarged and flattened and siip])orts only two or three barbs.
In the bottle, which contains no other specimens, is a detached operculum which exactly fits the modified radiole and without doubt belongs to this annelid, placing it therefore in the genus Apomat us.
The operculum has the form shown in the figure, being broadly obovate or egg-shaped and quite smooth, soft and membranous.
In all other respects the specimen agrees with the type.
Some fragments of tubes indicate that two are sometimes coherent Apomatus geniculataâ€” side by side.

Johnson describes the operculum as having about 100 ribs and marginal denticulations.
In these specimens the number is always much greater and varies from 140 to 160.
Miss Bush also has noted a larger number on her specimens.
The functional operculum is developed sometimes on the right, sometimes on the left side.
The accessory operculum is simply clavate.
Varying with the size of the specimen the branchiae number from 36 to 55 pairs.
The seta?
of the collar have from 2 to 4 large, blunt teeth at the base of the long, slender, curved tip, and theuncini are usually 5or 6-toothed.
Tubes forming a large mass coherent side by side are much thinner and more fragile than tubes found singly.

The tubes of this very characteristic species agree so closely with Levinsen's figure that I refer them thereto, in preference to giving a new name founded upon the peculiarities of the worm, though it may be that the animal which occupies the tubes figured by Levinsen will prove to be quite different.
The figures of the tubes given by Levinsen would serve equally well for these.
They are close, sinistral, discoid coils without any true central opening, the first coils being in contact in the center.
As the tubes grow older the outer turns tend to overlap and pile upon the inner, leaving a deep central depression bounded by nearly vertical 1908.]
363 At the same time the tube, which is perfectly smooth in the early stages, becomes roughened by growth lines, and its walls become very thick, solid and stony, and are ornamented by three thick and stout ridges rounded on the free side and covering most of the outer surface of the shell.
Here and there the depressions between them are crossed by transverse spurs and rods.
At the aperture of the tube these ridges project as three very strong and prominent teeth.
Fully developed tubes are usually 3.5 mm.
in diameter and composed of 4 to 4J turns.
The carinae begin at the end of the third turn and I.evinsen's figure very accurately represents one in a half-grown condition, in which the ridged whorl is just beginning to turn in upon the inner coils.
One more turn, with the ridge characters exaggerated, would Spirorbis tridentatus â€” a, an operculum in side \\eyv, filled -vvith embryos and showing the imperfect four-tiered calcareous plug, X 24; fe, one of the calcareous plates detached and seen from the inner surface, X 24; c, a collar seta, the fin at the base may be somewhat too long, X 600; d, the two seta?
of an abdominal bundle, X 600. result in a condition exactly like my full-grown tubes, in which the inner coils are completely concealed from above and the exposed parts bear massive ridges.
Where free to grow without restraint the tubes are strictly discoid and the lower surface of all of the coils is in intimate contact with the alga to which they are attached, but when the individuals are crowded the coils are heaped up in various irregular and often angulated forms.
In general form the operculum (a) agrees well with that of S. granulatus, being a slender cone containing a broad pouch filled with embryos and tapering regularly into a long but rather stout stalk.
The caloareous part, however, is remarkable, being built up of 3 or even 4 (a) calcareous disks of complex form (6).
Each has a somewhat grooved rim with thin projecting flanges whose margins appear to be entire when perfect, but are usually jagged as a result of wear.
It is very seldom that more than the basal disk and the one next beyond are found entire.
An excentric opening prolonged into a tube on the proximal side perforates each disk obliquely dorsal to the center and accommodates the siphuncular ligament, binding all together.
The number of branchia; is about 11, but could not be definitely ascertained, owing to their being so closely matted together.
There are 3 thoracic and about 24 setigerous abdominal segments, the latter region being veiy short.
The winged collar setffi have the form shown at c, the basal fin being very long, uniform!

Nothing distinctive can be detected about the uncinial plates.

PART I : ARIZONA.
BY JAMES A, G. REHN AND MORGAN HEBARD.
During the summer of 1907 Orthopterological field work was carried on by the authors at a number of stations extending from El Paso, Texas, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, to southern and north-central California, the material and notes secured being very extensive and of great value.
In this paper we present the results of our work in Arizona, giving first an idea of the environment of the various localities visited.
A trip to the little known Baboquivari range in southern Pima County was interrupted and of necessity abandoned on account of the flooded condition of the country to be traversed.
Much good material, however, was taken before our party was compelled to return to Tucson.
Mr. Otho Poling, the well-known Lepidopterist of Quincy, Illinois, accompanied us through southern Arizona and assisted in collecting much of the material, while all secured in northern Arizona was taken by the junior author.
The number of specimens examined was nine hundred and seventy-three, while the species numbered sixty-three.
Several specimens collected at Nogales and Grand Canyon by Dr. P. P. Calvert in 1906 and a small series taken in or near the Huachuca Mountains by Mr. H. A. Kaeber in the summer of 1907 have also been studied and inserted in this paper, but these are not included in the count of species and specimens.
The types of all the new forms are in the Hebard Collection.
Tucson, Pima County, Arizona.
â€” Elevation about 2,400 feet.
July 23 and 26.
The immediate vicinity of Tucson is a nearly level desert plain, extending from the Santa Catalina to the Tucson Mountains, drained by the Santa Cruz River and other less constant and smaller streams and washes.
A considerable portion of this plain is covered with stretches of greasewood (Covillea tridentata) and scattered growths of various cacti.
In the vicinity of the water courses and washes mesquite {Prosopis sp.)
is the predominating vegetation, attaining a height of twenty feet or more in favorable locahties, especially along the Santa Cruz River.
The most successful collecting was found in and about a vacant lot on the edge of the city, in the central part of which was a small pool of water, the outlet of a city drain.
About 24 this pool were high cat-tails and other thick growths of plants, in which situation Orthopters were found to be very plentiful, and likewise among a nearby dense thicket of wild sunflowers and bushes.
In these situations the following species were taken: Paratettix toltecus, Syrhula fusco-vittata, Scyllina calida, Encoptolophus texensis, Trepidulus rosaceus, Conozoa carinata, Anconia Integra, Schistocerca vaga, ^oloplus tenuipennis, Melanoplus brownii, M. atlanis and (Ecanthus quadripunctatus.
In the irrigated fields near the river some specimens were found, although by no means as many as might have been expected in a locality apparently so favorable.
On the typical desert greasewood plain forms peculiar to a like environment, such as Heliastus aridus, Ligurotettix kunzei, Derotmema laticinctum and Psoloessa texana, were taken.
In the city at night about the arc Hghts thousands of Gryllids swarmed and could be easily captured in great numbers.
Sonora Road Canyon, Tucson Mountains, Pima County, Arizona.
â€” Altitude about 3,000 feet.
July 25.
The old Sonora trail after leaving Tucson winds around the southeast base of the rather low Tucson Mountains, then turns sharply and crosses the range by following up an arroyo or torrent bed and traversing a very low pass in a shallow canyon with sloping sides.
The canyon is very rough and much of the rock exposure is dull reddish in color.
The vegetation is composed in large part of desert foothill types, the most noticeable of which are numerous sahuaro {Cereus giganteus), palo verde {Cercidium torreyanum), choUa {Opuntia sp.)
and the peculiar Koeberlinia spinosa.
Orthoptera were few in number, but the species found were of very great interest and differed noticeably from those of the surrounding plains.
These included a new mantis Yersinia sophronica, a new Truxalid Horesidotes papagensis, Ageneotettix australis, Aulocara rufum, Arphia teporata and Phrynotettix magnus.
The majority of the specimens taken showed considerable adaptation of their coloring to the reddish exposures.
Sahuaro Slope, Southwest Side of the Tucson Mountains, Pima County, Arizona.
â€” July 25.
After crossing the Tucson range the Sonora trail descends the extensive and gentle southwestern slope of the mountains through a numerous growth of sahuaro or giant cactus {Cereus giganteus), with attendant greasewood {Covillea tridentata) bushes growing thickly and often to a height of over six feet.
Many other plants flourish, the intervening ground between them being usually quite bare, as is often the case in this desert country.
On the greasewood in this situation Ligurotettix was very plentiful and its faint stridulation was to be heard on every side.
Most of the collecting was done at an elevation of about 2,500 feet.
Near Sonora Road, Southwest of the Tucson Mountains, Pima County, Arizona.
â€” July 25.
Several miles from the Tucson Mountains collecting was carried on for a short time in a grassy area with occasional bunches of rabbitweed.
In this locality Orthoptera were found to be far more plentiful than on the surrounding more truly desert plain.
Among the species taken were Psoloessa texana, Encoptolophus subgracilis, Tomonotus aztecus, Trepidulus rosaceus, Trepididus melleolus, Derotmema laticinctum and Hesperotettix festivus.
Roehle's Ranch, near Coyote Springs, Pima County, Arizona.
â€” July 24 and 25.
This locality is in the lower level of a plain stretching from the Tucson to the Comobabi range, near a large arroyo known as Roeble's Wash.
It is in a uniform mesquite and rabbitweed region, with no striking difference in conditions for a number of miles to the northeast.
Two specimens of Trepidulus melleolus were the most interesting forms taken.
Yuma, Yuma County, Arizona.
â€” Elevation about 150 feet, July 27 and 28.
To the east of Yuma the desert stretches, broken by occasional low volcanic hills, where it is too hot for even the greasewood to thrive and desert Orthoptera are almost wholly absent.
Along the Colorado River, however, is a wide strip of willows, and back of these ground heavily overgrown with arrow-wood (Plv^hea sericea) and other reeds where collecting was more productive.
These, although so near the river, were nevertheless parched with the heat.
To the east along the Gila River a great expanse of high weeds was found, but so dry that many fell to pieces when touched and insect life was extremely scarce.
In the irrigated tract below Yuma Orphulella compta was very abundant.
In the town at night Gryllidse and thousands of beetles and other insects swarmed around the arc lights.
All of these Gryllids flew rapidly about, and would have been difficult to capture had they not come to the light dazed and confused.
Williams, Coconino County, Arizona.
â€” Altitude, 6,748 feet.
September 13, The little collecting done here was accomplished near the station in a field of short weeds and grass, and also near the pine "glades" as they may be called.
The whole country about Williams is on nearly the same plane but gently rolling.
Over this area pines were thickly scattered, underneath which was practically no underbrush but very green grasses, this vegetation imparting to the whole country a park-like appearance.
In the vacant field, where the weeds were more abundant than elsewhere, Orthoptera were found more plentiful than we had expected to find them at this elevation.
Anita, Coconino County, Arizona.
â€” Altitude about 6,500 feet.
September 11.
At this small station, between W^illiams and the Grand Canyon, but very little time was allowed for collecting.
It is in the midst of the pine ''glades," and, no town being located there, the few specimens taken are typical of the park-like country on the top of the Coconino plateau.
The country was in general the same as that outside the town of Williams.
Grand Canyon of the Colorado, Coconino County, Arizona.
Rim of the Canyon at Bright Angel and 7iam7^/.â€” Elevation, 6,800-7,000 feet.
September 1 1 .
Back from the edge of the canyon the country is rolling and covered with a forest of pines, under which in most places there is practically no vegetation or soil on the sheet of rock forming the top layer of the plateau.
In this country collecting was almost utterly without result, but along the edge of the canyon, and for a short distance back from it, better results were obtained.
An area to the southeast of the hotel was also found where there was some low vegetation under the pines and in this situation Ageneotettix curtipennis and Amphitornus nanus were taken.
The Bright Angel TrazY.â€” Altitudes, 6,866 -2,436 feet.
September 12.
For some distance on this trail the collecting proved to be much as at the edge of the canyon, but farther down at about 5,850 feet the canyon side became more open, a few junipers appeared and the open places were filled with thickets and grasses.
It was here (5,800-4,900 feet â– elevation) that Melanoplus canonicus and Syrbula modesta were not imcommon, but more or less difficult to capture owing to the extreme steepness of the location.
Farther down (elevation 4,350-3,900 feet) in the grassy valley above the Indian Garden Spring, it was surprising to note that, in spite of the difference of three thousand feet in elevation and the more grassy country, practically the same forms as those occurring at the top of the canyon were found.
In the garden of the Indian Spring House one Paratettix toltecus was taken.
Diligent search failed to disclose more than two specimens of Orthoptera on the wide canyon mesa (3,700-3,800 feet) which was covered with a sage and occasional patches of prickly pear.
The Trimerotropis vinculata was among sage, while the Paropomala perpallida was captured on the very brink of the canyon precipice (elevation 3,750 feet) in a scant bunch of a sort of wdre-grass.

This very peculiar species differs from Y. solitaria Scudder from the eastern slope and foothills of the Rocky Mountains, western Nebraska and southeastern Arizona in the smaller size, the more compressed head with strongly acute mammiform eyes which are hardly at all divergent and in the shorter cephalic limbs.
In the form of the head and eyes this species suggests the structure found in the African and Indian genera Episcopus and Parepiscopus.
Size small; form very slender; surface smooth.
Head strongly compressed ; occiput strongly concave, rounded ; interantennal region with a pair of median parallel longitudinal carinse which terminate dorsad in short sharp points before reaching the dorsal line of the head; antennae filiform, not quite equal to the pronotum in length; eyes very elongate, not divergent, subparallel, strongly produced mammiform.
Pronotum rather short, subequal in width without any marked supra-coxal dilation, the width contained nearly three times in the length; cephalic margin rounded, caudal margin truncate; median carina distinct throughout, but very delicate on the collar.
Mesonotum and metanotum httle expanded, with distinct median carina, no vestiges of tegmina or wings.
Abdomen subfusiform, a finely marked median carina present throughout its length, distal third quite narrow ; supra-anal plate trigonal ; subgenital plate rounded with a median incision dividing it into Fig.

LITANEUTRIA Saussure.
Litaneutria skinneri Rehn.
A male specimen from the Grand Canyon, altitude 7,000 feet, September 11, 1907, belongs to this species, while another male, not quite mature, from Tucson, July 26, is referred to it with some little doubt.
The Grand Canyon male has the tegmina slightly shorter than the typical individuals of that sex, while the blackish tegminal maculation of the type is absent.

SYRBULA st&i.
Syrbula fuscovittata Thomas.
At Tucson on July 26 two males and three females of this species were taken from high weeds growing in damp soil surrounding a pool.
An immature female was also taken in Sonora Road Canyon, Tucson Mountains, July 25.
One of the males is in a condition similar to that of the specimen of the same sex recorded by Rehn.^ Two of the females are in the green phase and the other in the brown phase, with, however, much very pale green on the face and sides of the head, lateral lobes of the pronotum, tegmina and caudal femora.
The males are smaller than the average of a series of eight from the Huachuca Mountains.
Syrbula modesta Bruner.
This rather diminutive species was taken at elevations ranging from 4,900 to 5,800 feet in the Grand Canyon, three males and two females being included in the series.
Apparently this species has two color phases, as all the specimens seen are in a brown phase of coloration, while Bruner's original description shows that his specimens had green or greenish the predominating color.

As far as known this species is found only in the Grand Canyon region.
The males of this form, instead of flying straight from one place to another, rise usually very swiftly in a curve which, on account of their size and coloration, makes them very hard to follow.
The females rely almost altogether on their powerful saltatorial ability.
Often in alighting the males would select the terminal twigs of a juniper as resting places.
In distribution it appeared to be very local.
BOOTETTIX Bruner.
Bootettix argentatus Bruner.
This very interesting species was taken at several localities and always on its favorite shrub, the greasewood (Covillea tridentata).
At Yuma on July 27 it was found to be numerous and seven males were taken; an immature individual was collected at Sentinel, July 27.
An adult male and an immature specimen were taken on the Sahuaro slope southwest of the Tucson ]\Iountains, July 25.
All the specimens collectq^l lack decided spots on the sutural margin of the tegmina, and even traces are present in only one individual.

ORPHULELLA Giglio-Tos.
Orphulella oompta Scudder.
This species was exceedingly abundant at Yuma, on irrigated ground along the Colorado River south of the town.
On July 28 a series of twenty-six males, sixteen females and two nymphs was taken.
Of this series about half is in the green phase, while the remainder is divided between a full brown phase and one possessing both green and brown in its make-up â€” a mixed phase.
Only one, a female, shows any tendency toward purphsh on the tegmina, and in this case it is not strongly marked.
There is a considerable amount of variation in size in both sexes, and also in the form of the angle and depth and extent of the excavation of the fastigium.
^ This bar is very faintly indicated on the head.
1908.
379 The records of this species show its main range to be over the lower part of the Colorado Valley and adjacent Salton Basin, while the occurrence of it at San Bernardino Ranch, Cochise County, in southeastern Arizona, in all probability, is due to the species following up the Yaqui Valley from the Gulf of California section of ^lexico.

SCYLLINA St&l.
Scyllina calida Bruner.
One female specimen of this species was taken at Tucson, July 26, in short grass growing about the end of a drain.
Its movements were quite awkward.
The previous records of this species in the United States are from San Bernardino Ranch, Cochise County, and Baboquivari Mountains, Pima County, Arizona.
PSOLOESSA Scudder.
Psoloessa texana Scudder.
The series of specimens of the genus Psoloessa taken in Arizona in the summer of 1907 numbers one hundred and six.
After considerable study of this and other material, the authors are under the necessity of considering the four nominal species of this genus (texana, ferruginea, maculipennis and huddiana) as one, for which they select the name texana as it has page priority over ferruginea and maculipennis, huddiana being of much later date.
To some this may appear unwarranted as characters, such as the angle of the face, proportions of the lateral f oveolse of the head and the width of the fastigium, as well as the color pattern, have been used in * Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
PMla., 1904, p. 563.
25 keys to separate the "species," To present the reasons for creating the synonymy clearly, it would be best to explain the methods used in reaching the conclusions.
The original descriptions of ferruginea, maculipennis, texana and buddiana were tabulated in parallel columns, and from the mass of material specimens which agreed as nearly as possible with these descriptions were selected.
The condensed diagnostic characters of the four "species" are as follows : Typical buddiana.
Whole dorsum uniform pale pinkish brown.
Lateral bars solid and well marked.
Caudal femora with but a faint indication of the dorsal bar at the terminal third.
Typical ferruginea.
Whole dorsum ochraceous with the usual markings on the dorsum of the metazona.
Lateral bars broken.
Caudal femora with distinct bar at the terminal third.
Typical maculipennis.
Dorsum of the closed tegmina and pronotum sprinkled with blackish quadrate or subquadrate spots.
Lateral bar with the remains less sharply defined than in ferruginea.
Typical texana.
Dorsum suffused with blackish.
Tegmina blackish with the veins dark.
Caudal femora with the dorsum of the genicular portion black.
The number of specimens of the total of one hundred and six which appeared to be typical of these forms were: buddiana, three; ferruginea, ten; maculipennis, nine; texana, three, while eighty-one or over seventy-five per cent, were typical of none.
Of this remaining series twelve share characters of buddiana, ferruginea and maculipennis, sixtysix characters of ferruginea and maculipennis and three characters of maculipennis and texana.
When compared with three Shovel Mount, Texas, females the Arizona females differ uniformly in the narrower fastigium, which is usually more deeply excavated or at least appears to be so.
When the Arizona series of both sexes is examined there is seen to be considerable variation in both sexes in the width of the fastigium, irrespective of locality or color phase, and in the degree of constriction of the lateral carinae of the pronotum.
Careful examination of the selected typical females fails to show any difference in the facial angle, and the shape of the lateral foveolse is of such variability that no reliance can be placed on this character.
The long type of foveolse, supposed to be peculiar to the texana form, can be duplicated in specimens picked haphazard from the series of the other three types, and moreover the dark texana has as much variability in the few specimens available of the form as one needs to convince them of the variability of this character.
From this evidence there appears but one conclusion to be drawn, and that is to consider the different types forms of one species, as the presence of a seventy-five per cent, intermediate series leaves open to us only this solution or the most arbitrary allotment of this "mixed" body.
The latter course has nothing in its favor, as the definition of the "species" would be a practical impossibility.
The localities represented in the series at hand are Tucson, July 26, four cJ*, twelve 9 ; Sonora Road Canyon, Tucson Mountains, July 25, ' one 9 ; near Sonora Road, southwest of Tucson Mountains, July 25, seven d^, five 9 ; Roeble's Ranch near Coyote Springs, July 24 and 25, twenty-eight 6^, forty-eight 9 .
Typical huddiana was taken at Tucson, near Sonora Road and Roeble's Ranch, ferruginea at Tucson and Roeble's Ranch, maculipennis at Tucson and Roeble's Ranch and texana at Tucson and near Sonora Road.
This insect appears to be the most difficult to capture of almost any of the desert species encountered, this being due to its remarkable protective coloration and to its great swiftness in springing into the air and taking flight.
It was by all odds the most plentiful and widely distributed desert species collected.
AGENEOTETTIX McNeill.
Ageneotettix australis Bruner.
An adult male of this species was taken in Sonora Road Canyon, July 25, and an immature female at Roeble's Ranch, the same date.
The mature specimen was captured on the rocky canyon side.
Ageneotettix ourtipennis Bruner.
A female specimen from Bright Angel, altitude 7,000 feet, September 11, is referred to this species.
The tegmina are very short, not more than one-third the length of the abdomen, and the caudal tibiae have the proximal third ochraceous clouded and sprinkled with fuscous.
The original locality for this species was simply "Southern Colorado," and in consequence this is the first definite record for the species.
The specimen was found on stony ground, among low plants in a forest of pinon and juniper, where Amphitornus nanus was the only other species of Orthoptera seen.
ATJLOCARA Scudder.
Aalooara rufum Scudder.
A single male of this species was taken in Sonora Road Canyon, Tucson Mountains, July 25.
LIGUEOTETTIX McNeiU.
Ligurotettix kunzei Caudell.
This extremely interesting and peculiar species is represented by a series of forty-five specimens taken at Tucson, July 26 (three d^, two 9 ), Sonora Road near Tucson Mountains, July 25 (twelve c?, five adult ?
, one immature 9 ), Roeble's Ranch, July 24 and 25 (eight c?, one adult $ , one immature 9 ), Sentinel, Maricopa County, July 27 (one 6"), and Yuma, July 27 (three c^, eight 9 ).
The Yuma specimens are as large as Tucson individuals and do not seem to approach the smaller Californian L. coquilletti.
In size the whole series is fairly uniform, some slight individual variation being noticed in both sexes.

The most peculiar variation is in the presence of blackish brown on the cephalic half or more of the lateral lobes of the pronotum, and also on the pleura accompanied by a suffusion of the gense.
In its complete form this phase is present in but one female from Yuma, in which the contrast with the pale dorsum and caudal portion of the lateral lobes is very striking, although suggested more or less strongly by a few, chiefly males, from Tucson, Sonora Road and Roeble's Ranch.
There is a considerable amount of variation in the sprinkling and lining of the dorsum of the pronotum and head and the tegmina with blackish brown, this being, however, more noticeable in the females than in the males.
The Yuma specimens as a series and the Sentinel individual are paler and more ashy than those from the vicinity of Tucson and the Papago country, which may possibly be due to the increased aridity and greater sunlight of southwestern Arizona when compared with the Tucson region.
The usual position of specimens on the main branches of Covillea would allow reflected light to play a very important part in color bleaching.
At Roeble's Ranch and along the Sonora Road this species was found chiefly on mesquite, where the insects clung tightly to the twigs and trusted so far to their protective coloration that those taken were cautiously approached with the hands and suddenly seized.
If not captured they sprang with agility to some other part of the bush and often escaped completely.
They stridulated frequently, a faint sikk, sikk, sik-sik-sik.
At Yuma the species was found on greasewood (Covillea) and was extremely active and wary in spite of the frightful heat.
ARPHIA Stil.
Arphia teporata Scudder.
Three males and a female taken on rocky desert hillside in Sonora Road Canyon, Tucson Mountains, July 25, belong to this species.
They are more thickly speckled and variegated with dark brown than a series from Alamogordo, New Mexico, and all are faintly washed with reddish brown.
ENCOPTOLOPHUS Scudder.
Enooptolophus texensis Bruner.
At Tucson along the Santa Cruz River on irrigated land this species was found July 26 in moderate numbers.
Eight males and six females were taken, three of the females being in a green phase of coloration, as previously noted in a Phoenix specimen,^ the green being on the head, pronotum, dorsal face of caudal femora and to a certain extent on the pleura, while another of the same sex is weakly greenish on the same areas.
The series exliibits an appreciable amount of variation in size, particularly in the male sex.
Enooptolophus subgracilis Caudell.
A single female with rather short tegmina and wings, taken July 25 in mesquite and rabbit-weed surroundings near the Sonora Road southwest of the Tucson Mountains, is apparently referable to this species.
The wings, however, are faintly yellowish proximad, in this respect resembling texensis.
The measurements of this specimen are as follows : = Proc.

Hippiscus corallipes (Haldeman).
A single female of this species, taken at the east base of the Huachuca Mountains, July 6, by H. A. Kaeber, has been examined.
The species has previously been recorded from that range by the senior author.^ DISSOSTEIRA Scudder.
Diisosteira Carolina (Linnaus).
Three males and two females of this widely distributed species were taken at Williams, September 13, while a single female was taken September 11 at Bright Angel, Grand Canyon, elevation of 6,850 feet.
TOMONOTUS Saussure.
Tomonotus ferruginosus Bruner.
A pair of this species from Palmerlee, Huachuca Mountains, Cochise County, Arizona, taken July 5 and 15 bj^ H. Kaeber, has been examined.
The range of this form includes localities from Southern California to Fort Grant and the Huachuca Mountains, southeastern Arizona, and from Phoenix, Arizona, to Uruapan, Michoacan, Mexico.
Tomonotus aztecus (Saussure). '
A series of seven males and two females of this species were taken July 25 near the Sonora Road, southwest of the Tucson Mountains, on a flat covered with very low weeds with many bare spaces between.
A single male was also taken the same day at Roeble's Ranch.
METATOR McNeill.
Metator pardalinum (Saussure).
A single female of this species, taken at Williams, September 13, is the first Arizona record of the genus and species.
The specimen has the disk of the wings scarlet and is inseparable from Colorado individuals.
It was taken in an open place thickly overgrown with rabbit-weed and other equally low vegetation.
MESTOBEEGMA Scudder.
Mestobregma obliterata Bruner.
A series of six males and ten females was taken at Williams, September 13.
There is considerable variation in the length of the tegmina Â« Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila., 1907, p. 36. and wings in the females, while the same is true of the caudal femora.
The disk of the wings is lemon yellow in all the specimens and the transverse bar is not distinctly marked.
The caudal margin of the disk and lateral lobes of the pronotum are distinctly colored with yellowish in a few specimens, while the angle of the tegmina is lined with the same in three specimens and with whitish in two others.
This species was found in the same situation as Metator pardalinum.
TREPIDULUS McNeill.
Trepidulus rosaceus (Scudder).
This very interesting species is represented by a series of twenty-nine males and twelve females.
The localities at which it was taken are Tucson, July 26 (10 d", 9 ? )
; near Sonora Road, July 25 (15 d', 2 9 ) ; Roeble's Ranch, July 25 (3 c?, 2 9 ), and Yuma, July 28 (1 d").
In size the series exhibits an appreciable amount of variation, while the coloration shows all conditions of ashy washes and blackish speckling and blotching, particularly on the dorsal aspect of the closed tegmina, while the base color ranges in spots from ochre to seal brown.
The pale ventral portion of the lateral lobes of the pronotum is, however, sharply defined in every individual, and the two dorsal blotches on the caudal femora are distinct in all but one female specimen.
Attention should be called to the fact that the Yuma individual is uniformly more grayish than specimens from the Tucson region, the maculations being sub-obsolete.
This species was found in the same restricted locality along the Sonora Road as Tomonotus aztecus and Trepidulus melleolus, where it was moderately plentiful; at Yuma the single specimen encountered was taken on a broad flat of high weeds which had been completely dried by the extreme heat.
It was found common among desert growth at Tucson, on the outskirts of the Mexican section of the town.
Trepidulus melleolus (Scudder).
Two males from the vicinity of the Sonora Road, July 25, and two males and a female from Roeble's Ranch, July 25, represent this interesting species.
It appears from the material in hand, five males and two females, that there is a great amount of individual variation in size in both sexes; the two females before us, one from Roeble's Ranch, the other from San Bernardino Ranch, Cochise County, having a considerable difference in size.
The coloration is fairly constant in character.
This species enjoys a range from northeastern New Mexico (La Trementina) to Pima County, Arizona.
r This striking form was taken on the desert plain in the two above locahties where it was extremely scarce.
DEROTMEMA Scudder.
Derotmema laticinctum Scudder.
On the desert plains of the Papago country this species was collected in numbers, a series of seventy-one males and thirty-three females being before us.
It was usually found on exposed areas of adobe soil and associated with Psoloessa texana.
The series is distributed as follows : Tucson, July 26, twenty-seven males, eleven females (one immature) ; Sahuaro slope, southwestern side of Tucson Mountains, July 24, one male; near Sonora Road, southwest of Tucson Mountains, July 25, eighteen males, fifteen females (two immature); Roeble's Ranch, July 24 and 25, twenty-five males (one immature), seven females (two immature).
This series is quite variable in the depth of coloration and in the character of the maculations on the anal area of the tegmina.
Some specimens have three or four comparatively large blotches on this portion of the tegmina, while others have the same region more or less thickly sprinkled with small quadrate blotches.
The fuscous bar on the wing varies in intensity and considerably in extent.
One specimen from Tucson has the bar very weak and of httle extent.
The specimens from the Baboqui vari Mountains previously recorded by the senior author as Derotmema delicatulum,^ prove on second examination and comparison with typical specimens of delicatulum to be this species.
The range of the species is now known to extend from the west slope of the Organ Mountains of central southern New Mexico to Phoenix, Maricopa County, and the Baboquivari region, Pima County, Arizona.
Derotmema delicatulum Scudder.
This rather remarkable species is represented by four specimens, two of each sex, taken at Sentinel, Maricopa County, July 27.
The very prominent eyes, very pale, in fact almost colorless, disk of the wing and much reduced but conspicuous and well-defined transverse blotch on the wing are sufficient to enable one to readily recognize the species.
The coloration is very pale, with the darker pattern well defined and comparatively regular.
The habitat of this form is the Mohave and Ymna deserts, ranging from the western edge of the Mohave at Mohave and Lancaster, California, to at least Sentinel, Maricopa County, Arizona.
The specimens ^ Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila., 1907, p. 72. listed above were collected during a train stop in a most arid and desolate location.
Derotmema haydeni (Thomas).
A series of five males and four females was taken at Williams, September 13 (two 6" , two 9 ), and Anita, September 11 (two c^, three ?
).
The disk of the wing is red in five specimens and yellow in four, regardless of locality.
The series from Williams is more blackish than usual in the species, while the Anita individuals are quite reddish.
The species has previously been recorded from Flagstaff.
At Anita the species was common on reddish soil in an open field, while at Williams it was taken in an open place heavily overgrown with low vegetation.
CONOZOA.
Saussure.
Conozoa carinata Rehn.
A series of five males and one female taken at Tucson, July 26, represent this species.
These specimens are somewhat paler than the types, while the males have the fastigium very slightly narrower than in the female type.
The female specimen has the metazona of the pronotum abnormally humped, probably as the result of an injury.
This species is now known to range from the Huachuca Mountains to the Baboquivari range, north to Tucson.
Conozoa sulcifrons (Scudder).
At Yuma this species was taken in numbers on July 26 and 27, a series of twenty-one males and twenty-three females being secured.
When compared with a series from Grand Junction, Colorado, the Yuma specimens are seen to average considerably larger.
The Yuma series is as a whole more warm brown in color, with the dorsal aspect of the head, pronotum and anal field of the tegmina paler and more uniform.
The specimens from Florence and Phoenix, Arizona, referred to C. acuminata with a query by the senior author^ belong to this species.
In size they are slightly smaller than Yuma individuals of the same sex.
This was the most plentiful species found on the dry earth of the river bed and along its banks.
Although an active flyer no great difficulty was experienced in capturing specimens.

The two forms, however, are very closely related.
Trimerotropis modesta Bruner.
A female of this form taken on the rim of the Grand Canyon, near Bright Angel, September 11, and a male taken at Williams, September 13, are in the collection.
The specific validity of this form appears to be rather questionable, as its relationship to T. citrina is so close that it may be nothing more than a race of that species.
Trimerotropis strenua McNeill.
Two specimens of this species were taken at Tucson, July 26, at light.
When compared with Salt Lake Valley specimens they are seen to be inseparable.
Snow has recorded this species from San Bernardino Ranch, Cochise County, Arizona.
Trimerotropis inconspioua Bruner.
Three males of this species taken at Bright Angel, Grand Canyon, 6,880 feet to 7,000 feet, are before us.
Two were taken July 29 to August 2, 1906, by Calvert, and one on September 11, 1907, by Hebard.
Two specimens are identical in coloration with the tegminal bars decidedly blackish and strongly contrasting with the pale ochraceous base color, while the other specimen is decidedly reddish, both bars and base color.
This species was described by Bruner from material taken at a number of localities in the Grand River region of western Colorado, this being the first record of the species from any locality outside of that State.
The specimen taken on September 11 was the only individual of the species noticed and was captured in the forest of piiion and juniper.
Trimerotropis vinculata Scudder.
This wide ranging species is represented by eighty-three specimens taken as follows: Tucson, July 26, 27 d^, 18 ?
; Sonora Road Canyon, July 25, 4 cJ*; Sonora Road near Tucson Mountains, July 25, 2 9 ; Roeble's Ranch, July 24 and 25, 13 d', 4 9 ; Nogales, August 13 (at light, Calvert), 1 d ; Yuma, July 28, 1 d" ; WiUiams, September 13, 1 6" ; Bright Angel Trail, Grand Canyon, elevation 3,000-7,000 feet, July 29August 2 (Calvert), September 11 and 12 (Hebard), 3 c?, 9 9 .
The specimens of the series present a considerable amount of varia' Trans.
Kansas Acad.
Sci., XX, pt.

As the variability of this species is almost endless, it is hardly necessary to call attention to any types except one which is suffused with ochraceousrufous, represented by all the Sonora Road Canyon specimens and faintly approached by one from Tucson, and a very dull type, represented by several from Bright Angel rim (7,000 feet) and the single individual from Wilhams.
Other specimens, however, from the rim of the Grand Canyon at Bright Angel are of normal contrast, and one is extremely contrasted with quite pale base color.
Trimerotropis cyaneipennis Bruner.
A series of sixteen males and seven females of this species was taken at elevations ranging from 3,800 to 7,000 feet on and in the vicinity of the Bright Angel Trail, Grand Canyon, September 11 and 12.
The majority of the specimens are strongly washed with reddish, the greater portion of these reddish specimens being from elevations not exceeding 5,000 feet, this being evidently due to a protective color modification influenced by the reddish exposure of that portion of the canyon walls.
A few individuals possess a more strongly contrasted coloration; the pale color being unsuffused and the bar groups darker.
These specimens are from 5,000 and 7,000 feet.
On comparing this series with that in the Academy collection I find that specimens from the northern portion of Arizona, south at least as far as Prescott, have the disk of the wings campanula blue in color, while individuals from the ranges of southeastern Arizona (Huachucas, etc.)
have the same area glaucous blue.
The difference is quite noticeable when the two types are compared.
This species makes at will a clatter similar to that of Circotettix verruculatus.
Especially when alarmed its flight is extremely swift and erratic.
It was not plentiful along the canyon edge, but lower on the Bright Angel Trail it was found almost everywhere, most plentiful, however, about bare places near precipices.
CIKCOTETTIX Scudder.
Circotettix undulatus (Thomas).
A series of seven males and nine females taken near the rim of the Grand Canyon at Bright Angel represents this species.
Two males and three females were taken July 29 to August 2, 1906, by Calvert, and the remainder September 11, 1907, by Hebard.
The sexes are of practically the same size, and the amount of individual variation of the same character is slight in a series of thirty-six specimens before us.
The general color varies from a decidedly blackish type to one distinctly dull reddish brown in general lone.
The previous Arizona records of this species were from Oak Creek Canyon and base of Humphrey's Peak, Coconino County.
This form was not uncommon in the open yellow pine groves near the hotel, while in other places it was very scarce.
Individuals of this species seem to be unable to fly without clattering.
In the afternoons it was not on the wing.
HADROTETTIX Scudder.
Hadrotettix trifasciatus (Say).
A single male of this species, collected by H. A. Kaeber, July 6, 1907, on the plains at the mouth of Ramsay Canyon, Huachuca Mountains, has been examined.
ANCONIA Scudder.
Anconia Integra Scudder.
At both Tucson and Yuma this species was encountered, five males and two females having been taken at the former locality on July 26 and twenty males and two females at the latter on July 27 and 28.
In size there is an appreciable amount of variation in the male sex, the four females being quite uniform.
All the females and four of the Tucson males are green; all the Yuma males and one Tucson male are hoary white or pale ochraceous more or less thickly overlaid with maculations of olive.
Several of the brownish specimens are very pale and but faintly maculate, while five are strongly marked, having the pronotal decussate markings pronounced.
The other brownish males are more or less intermediate between the two extreme types.
Tucson is the most eastern record for this species, the previously published Arizona records being from Phoenix and Bill William's Fork.
At Tucson this species was taken among high weeds both in damp and dry locations.
They were very wary and alert and when missed flew for some considerable distance.
A preference to alighting on the ground when pursued rather than on weeds and bushes was observed, though invariably first discovered among vegetation.
At Yuma it was found on the greasewood covered sand flats.
HELIASTXJS Saussure.
Heliastus aridus (Bruner).
This extremely variable species is represented by specimens taken at Tucson (July 26, 3 9), Sonora Road Canyon (July 25, 2 d^, 1 ?, 1 nymph), Sonora Road near Tucson Mountains (July 25, 1 ? )
and Roeble's Ranch (July 24, 1 6^, 1 9 ).
There is a great diversity in the size of the Tucson females, while the coloration is of the usual variability.
The three individuals from the Sonora Road Canyon are distinctly suffused with reddish, the males very strongly so, while the Tucson and Roeble's Ranch specimens have hoary white their most conspicuous color tone.
The Sonora Road specimen has as its general tint the peculiar blue gray often seen in this species.
This form was found to be a typical desert species, not noticed anywhere in numbers.
PHKYNOTETTIX Uhler.
Phrynotettix magnus (Thomas).
A pair of this species taken July 6 by H. A. Kaeber at Palmerlee and an immature male taken in Sonora Road Canyon, Tucson Mountains, July 25, have been examined.
The Palmerlee male is labelled "Found under manure."
The Sonora Road Canyon specimen was found on a rocky hillside.
SCHISTOCERCA StM.
Scliistocerca vaga (Scudder).
At Tucson four males and two females of this species were collected July 26.
One female is quite dark in color with strongly contrasted pattern; the other of the same sex shows Uttle contrast and is pale dull brownish.
The specimens were found among wild sunflowers and other high plants.
In this situation indi\dduals were taken with far greater ease than others previously seen on the desert.
Schistocerca venusta Scudder.
A male and two females taken at Yuma, July 27 and 28, and a male taken at Winslow, Navajo County, September 13, represent this species.
The Winslow specimen is more olive and less greenish than the Yuma individuals.
At Yuma a few specimens were seen in the dry stand of arrow-wood on the banks of the Gila River.
The species was very plentiful at Winslow, in tall weeds about a water tank.
CONALCEA Scudder.
Conalosea huachucana Rehn.
A female of this species, collected at Palmerlee July 6 by Kaeber, has been examined.
HESPEKOTETTIX Scudder.
Hesperotettix festivus Scudder.
A series of twenty-two males, twelve females and one nymph represents this species.
The localities are: Tucson, July 26, 1 d^, 1 9 ; Sahuaro slope, southwest of Tucson Mountains, July 24, 1 d^ ; Sonora Road near Tucson Mountains, July 25, 13 c?, 9 ?
, 1 nymph; Roeble's Ranch, July 25, 1 9 ; Williams, September 13, 1 c?, 1 9 .
In size but little variation is noticeable; the tegmina of the two Williams specimens, however, do not exceed the tips of the caudal femora.
Five specimens from Sonora Road are decidedly brownish, one strongly so, while all the others are shades of green, in a few cases with a faint bluish tinge to the tegmina.
Reddish pregenicular annuli are indicated more or less strongly on the caudal femora of all but three specimens, which latter are either in or approach the brownish phase.
The pale medio-longitudinal line on the pronotum is narrower in the Williams specimens than in a number of individuals from southern Arizona, This insect was one of the few species which was invariably found on or near rabbit-weed.
In the rabbit-weed tracts a number of specimens were often found in one small clump of the weed.
Relying on its protective coloration the insect often sought shelter in the center of the clump, but when frightened out of its retreat flew very swiftly on almost all occasions to another bunch of the same plant.
.ffiOLOPLTIS Scudder.
.ffioloplus tenuipennis Scudder.
At Tucson this species was found in weeds growing along an irrigating ditch and a series of six males and three females was taken on July 26, while at Yuma a single male was collected on July 27.
While agreeing with the original description in all essential points the Tucson individuals are decidedly larger than the type.
The extremes of the series measure as follows : Length of body, 17 Length of pronotum, Length of tegmen, .
Length of caudal femur, In color there is an appreciable amount of variation in the depth of the bars and maculations, the specimens with the base color dull ochre having the pattern more marked, while those with the same more yellowish have the pattern weaker.
The pink of the proximal twothirds of the caudal tibiae varies greatly in depth of color, being very delicate shell pink in some specimens and solferino in others with intermediates of various shades.
This species was described from Fort Grant, Graham County, Arizona, and has since been recorded from Bill William's Fork, western Arizona.

.ffioloplus arizonensis Scudder.
In the vicinity of Yuma this species was not uncommon, a series of seven males, fifteen females and one nymph being taken July 27 and 28.
Among the high dry weeds on the flood plain of the Gila River fourteen specimens were taken and a number of others seen; one specimen was captured on the summit of a desert hill, one in cultivated alfalfa and seven were taken at night under arc lights.
There is a perceptible amount of variation in size, the length of the tegmina being quite variable; no specimens, however, having these members shorter than the type measurements, while the greater majority have them much longer.
The remarks made under ^Eoloplus tenuipennis regarding color variation apply as well to this species, though the paler specimens have the tegmina distinctly light grayish, while in one specimen the pale color on the head and pronotum is almost whitish.
This species has been recorded from Fort Wliipple, Yavapai County, Arizona, and the Mohave Desert, MELANOPLUS Stil.
Melanoplus flabellifer Scudder.
A series of six males and seven females of this species was taken at Williams, September 13.
All are typical of flahellifer, showing little or no tendency toward occidentalis or cuneatus.
The coloration is quite dark, the pattern much subdued.
There is some variation in the depth of the glaucous color of the caudal tibiae.
This is the first record of the species from Arizona.
All of these specimens were taken in a field of low vegetation.
The insects were inactive as the dew was yet on the ground.
The condition of a number of the specimens shows that their season was well advanced.
Melanoplus herbaceus flavesoens Scudder.
Two males of this form were taken at Yuma on July 28, one on cultivated ground, the other on desert growth.
The only previous record of this form from Arizona was from Bill Wilham's Fork, MohaveYuma County, specimens from Phoenix being intermediate between herbaceus and flavescens.
Melanoplus brownii Caudell.
This species was abundant locally at Tucson, where a series of twelve males and nineteen females were taken on July 26.
In size there is an appreciable amount of individual variation, the extremes of the series measuring as follows : (?

The female specimen recorded by Rehn as M. canonicus?
from Florence, Arizona,^" and those of the same sex from the Huachuca range recorded by him as M. flavidus^^ are referable to this species.
The absence of accompanying males was responsible for the erroneous identifications.
The Florence individual has since been compared with the types of brownii.
The range of this species now extends from Yuma up the Gila Valley to Phoenix and Florence, southward to Tucson, the Baboquivari and Huachuca Mountains.
The species was found at Tucson, frequenting high weeds near water and cultivated areas.
Melanoplus atlanis (Riley).
A male and two females represent this widely distributed species, the localities being Williams, September 13 (d"), Tucson, July 26 ( ?
), and SonoraRoad near Tucson Mountains, July 25 (9 ).
These specimens are distinctly larger than eastern individuals of the species, a fact previously noted by Rehn^^ in regard to Florence and Phoenix, Arizona, representatives.
The Sonora Road specimen has the coloration strongly contrasted.
Melanoplus aridus (Scudder).
A very interesting series of this species was taken at localities in northern Arizona, a region from which it was previously not reported.
Nine specimens from Williams, September 13, five males, four females, average about equal in size to individuals from Florence, Arizona, and are distinctly smaller than Scudder's measurements.
Three males and one female taken at Anita, September 11, show a further reduction in size, while a series of fourteen males and eleven females from 10 Proc.

The senior author recently called attention^^ to the size variability of this species, citing Huachuca Mountain individuals larger than the original measurements.
The coloration of the Grand Canyon series shows little yellowish, having grays and gray-browns predominating, while the Anita and Williams specimens are somewhat brighter, though by no means as strikingly colored as Florence, Arizona, individuals.
The yellow of the ventral surface is pure in some specimens and much soiled and washed with red brown in others.
At Williams and Anita this species was extremely common in the grassy open glades of the pine forest, while at Grand Canyon it was the most abundant species of Orthoptera and was found ever3Awhere in the undergrowth of the heavier pine woods.
It was noted to be a very swift jumper, but a series was easily taken on account of its abundance.
Melanoplus femur-nigrum Scudder.
This little known species is represented by a series of two males and three females taken September 11 at the rim of the Grand Canyon at Bright Angel.
Here it was taken on an open hillside heavily overgrown with a plant resembling rabbit-weed.
The only previous record of this species is the original one from San Francisco Mountains, July 30, but its range is more extensive as witnessed by a female in the Academy Collection labelled "Albuquerque, N.
Mex., July 13, Oslar."
It is quite probable that this specimen was taken in the mountains near Albuquerque, as it is hardly likely to occur in the distinctly Sonoran vicinity of the city.
Melanoplus femur-rubrum (DeGeer).
A male of this species was taken at Winslow, Navajo County, 4,848 feet elevation, September 13.
Melanoplus canonicus Scudder.
A series of two males and seven females, taken September 12 along or near the Bright Angel Trail, Grand Canyon, represent this species.
These specimens were taken at altitudes ranging from 4,850 to 6,800 feet, one female alone being from above an elevation of 5,800 feet.
The species was found only in scattered growths of pinon and juniper, exhibiting a preference for the latter tree.
Specimens were found on the ground, in bushes and chnging to the twigs of juniper.

â€¢ This species was taken at light at Tucson (July 23, 1 9 ) and Yuma (July 27 and 28, 3 9) and was decidedly scarce wherever it was encountered.
The Tucson specimen is appreciably larger than the Yuma individuals.
GRYLLUS Linnseus.
Gryllus personatus Uhler.
At Tucson this species came to light in great numbers the evenings of July 23 and 26, a series of twenty males and eighteen females being collected.
Size as usual exliibits a considerable range of variation, while several males are of a strongly megacephalic type.
As the proportions of the caudal femora and ovipositors and the measurements of the tegmina may prove of use to future workers, they are tabled below.

At Yuma on the evenings of July 27 and 28 this species frequented the vicinity of the electric lights in considerable numbers.
A series of fourteen males and sixteen adult and one immature female was taken.
There is an appreciable but not very great variation in the size of individuals of this species, while the coloration varies only in the suffusion of the pronotal markings; some specimens having them distinct and others having them clouded with a wash of the darker color.

Four specimens taken at Tucson, July 23-26, are referred to this species, one male, a female, attracted to light, and two immature individuals.
NOTES ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF COLORADO MAMMALS, WITH A DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF BAT (EPTESICUS PALLIDUS) FROM BOULDER.
BY ROBERT T. YOUNG.
In the following article I propose (1) to discuss briefly the distribution of the mammals of the mountains of northern central Colorado in their relation to the life zones of that region;^ (2) to point out the apparent movement of some species relative to their centers of dispersal and to give a few facts regarding the little known distribution of certain forms in this State, and (3) to describe a new species of bat from Boulder.
(1) Distribution of mammals relative to the life zones of northern central Colorado.
In two recent papers by Ramaley^ and myself^ the life zones of the Rocky Mountains in this region, as determined by the flora, have been mapped out.
Does the mammalian fauna of the mountains show the same zonation as does the flora?
The zones as outlined by Ramaley are as follows : 1.
Plains Zone, below 5,800 feet.
2.
Foothill Zone, from 5,800 to 8,000 feet.
3.
Montane Zone, from 8,000 to 10,000 feet.
4.
Sub-alpine Zone, from 10,000 to 11,500 feet.
5.
Alpine Zone, from 11,500 to 14,000 feet.
The first of these not being a mountain zone may be omitted from our discussion.
The last four correspond to the zones which I, in accordance with the terminology of Merriam* and others, have specified as Transition 1,650-2,400 m., Canadian 2,400-2,850 m., Hudsonian 2,850-3,300 m. and Alpine^ 3,300-3,450 m.Â« ^ Where the records for any species number very few, I have usually omitted such species from this part of my discussion.

Gaz., Vol.
XLIV, pp.

* Life Zones and Crop Zones of the United States, Bull.
10, U S. Biological Survey.
^ Merriam applies the term Arctic-Alpine to this zone.
^Ramaley's terminology, as apphed to this particular region, is perhaps more desirable than that of Merriam; but for purposes of comparison -nith other regions, and for the sake of uniformity, I much prefer the latter.
While it is well known that an absolute delimitation of zonal areas in mountain regions is impossible, whether plants or animals are chosen as characteristics, still the zones as outlined above are fairly well defined by their plant inhabitants.
Of the mountain mammals of northern Colorado many range widely from timber line to the plains, and, with a few exceptions, there are none whose range is closely coincident with any one of the zones mentioned above.
These exceptions are the following: Sciurus dberti concolor, Citellus variegatus grammurus, Citellus elegans, Cynomys leucurus, Peromyscus truei nasutus, Neotoma jallax, and Spilogale tenuis in the Transition zone ; and Lepiis americanus bairdi, OcJiotona saxatilis and Phenacomys preblei in the Hudsonian zone.
The Canadian zone possesses no characteristic mammals.
Species ranging through both Hudsonian and Canadian zones, but mainly restricted to them, are the following: Evotomys gapperi galei, Microtus nanus, Gulo luscus, Mustela americana, Putorius streatori leptus and Putorius arizonensis.
Boreal species which include the Transition zone within their range ' are as follows: Cervus canadensis, vis canadensis, Sciurus fremonti, Eutamias am.oenus operarius, Eutamias minimus consohrinus^ Callospermophilus lateralis, Marmota flaviventer, Neotoma orolestes, Microtus mordax, Thomomys fossor, Thomomys clusius fuscus, Zapv^ princeps, Erethizon epixanthus, Sylvilagus pinetis,^ Felis hippolestes.
Lynx uinta, Ursus americanus, Sorex ohscurus, Sorex personatus, and Neosorex palustris navigator.
Vidpes macrourus should probably be included in this list, but as to its altitudinal limits I haA^e no definite information.
Sonoran species extending into the Transition zone are the following : Odocoileus macrourus, Antilocapra americana.
Mephitis mesomelas varians and Putorius longicauda.
Of general distribution through both Sonoran and Boreal regions may be mentioned the following species : Odocoileus hemionus.
Bison hison,^ Eutamias quadrivittatus , Citellus tridecemlineatus pallidus.
Castor canadensis jondator, Peromyscus nebracensis, Peromyscus rufinus, Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus, Lepus campestris, Lepus townsendi, Canis sp.,^^ Taxidea taxus, Lutreola, lutreocephala energumenos and Putorius nigripes.
Both the wild cat and timber wolf ought probably to be included under ' Extends into the Sonoran.
^ Also Sonoran to some extent.
I have taken it 12 km.
east of Boulder on the hot barren plains. "
Now practically extinct. '"
The distribution of the different forms of coyotes through the mountains is not 3^et kno-\vn.
this last heading.
I have omitted them, however, because I have no information as to the species of each, and but little as to their distribution.
Thus we find the Alpine zone with no characteristic mammals, the Hudsonian with three, the Canadian with none and the Transition with seven, while there are six Boreal species (Cervus occidentalis, Eutamais m. consobrinus, Thomomys clusius fuscus, TJiomomys fossor, SyJvilagus pinetis and Neosorex palustris navigator) and one Sonoran-Boreal form {Eutamias quadrivittatus) which probably do not extend much above the Canadian zone, and six which seldom if ever extend below it.
In addition to the seven species characteristic of the Transition zone, we find this zone forming the lower limit of eighteen Boreal species and the upper limit of four Sonoran forms.
While the Alpine zone possesses many characteristic plants, on the mammalian side it is characterized chiefly by the paucity of its fauna, possessing not a single characteristic species.
The Hudsonian and Canadian zones have most of their mammals in common, while of the three species characteristic of the former zone, Ochotona saxatilis^^ invades the latter to some extent, while on the other hand it occurs in the Alpine zone in suitable places.
These facts bring out very clearly, I believe, the distinctness of Boreal and Sonoran regions in northern Colorado, as" based on the distribution of the mammals in this territory.
The Transition zone is, as its name imphes, a meeting ground of these two great regions, common to, and yet distinct from each.
They show further the intimate relation between Hudsonian and Canadian zones.
Using the mammals only as a criterion, I hardly believe w^e should be justified in separating these zones from each other; their characteristics are relatively much fewer than among the plants.
(2) The movement of some species relative to their centers of dispersal and notes on the httle known distribution of certain forms.
The occurrence of a species outside its proper habitat does not necessarily prove a migration on the part of that species from such habitat.
It may, on the contrary, mean that the species formerly had a more widespread distribution than at present, becoming secondarily restricted to its present habitat, with the exception of a few stragglers remaining in the territory formerly occupied by it.
This is a question which cannot, in most cases, be settled with our present lack " Warren, E. R. : The Mammals of Colorado, Colorado College Publications, Science Series, No.
46, p. 254, mentions the coney as occurring as low as 2,834 m. near Crested Butte.
of data regarding the former abundance of the species in the region in question.
Where, however, a typical plains form, as Putorius nigripes or Citellus tridecemlineatus pallidus, is found in the higher mountains, I believe we are justified in concluding that they have migrated outside of their proper habitat.
Sciurus ludovicianus.
This species is now quite common in the neighborhood of Greeley, where I understand it has been introduced from Omaha.
It is also present in Denver.
Citellus tridecemlineatus pallidus.
The presence of this spermophile at Divide,^^ altitude 3,000 m., and elsewhere in the mountains,^^ indicates a westward and upward movement of this species from its center in the Great Plains, probably dependent upon the presence of its physical habitat, the grass-sagebrush plains in some parts of the mountains, rather than upon temperature.
Peromyscus nebracensisThis is another plains form of Upper Sonoran and Transition zones which appears to be invading the mountains, judging by its occurrence at an altitude of 3,508 m.^^ and elsewhere through the mountains.
Phenacomys preblei.
The only record hitherto of this species is that given by Merriam^^ from Long's Peak.
I have taken a single specimen on North Boulder Creek at about 2,900 m. altitude.
This is the only specimen I have secured in spite of careful trapping in several places.
Spilogale tenuis.
I have taken a few of this species at Boulder, hitherto known only from Arkins and Estes Park.
Putorius nigripesThe occurrence of the black-footed ferret at an altitude of 3,124 m.^* indicates a probable migration on its part from its habitat on the plains into the mountains. "

Putorius longicauda.
This weasel invades the mountains also to some extent, as I have observed it in Boulder Canyon several miles above its mouth.
Sorex personatus.
The occurrence of this shrew in the Rocky Mountains as far south as Colorado extends considerably southward in these mountains the range of this northern and eastern form.
Its presence in the meadows about Boulder brings this Boreal species down to the edge of the Upper Sonoran zone.
Sorex personatus haydeni.
Warren^^ records a specimen of this shrew taken by him at Lake Moraine and identified by Merriam.
Inasmuch as haijdeni is a North Dakota plains form its occurrence in the Hudsonian zone on Pike's Peak is certainly interesting.
Have we here a marked case of migration, a case of polygenesis, or is haijdeni, as Elliott^^ believes, a synonym for personatusl Sorex vagrans dobsoni.
This is another interesting record given by Warren^^ and based on an identification by Merriam.

10, p. 68, the latter gives the distribution of this shrew as parts of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Utah.
He says further in the same place: "The interrelations of dobsoni and obscurus are intricate and perplexing.
The two animals resemble one another very closely, but no intergrades have been found, and each has, so far as known, an independent distribution."
This record extends the range of dobsoni considerably southward, making it coincident, at this point at least, with that of obscurus.
Sorex obscuruB.
Merriam^" gives the distribution of this species as "Restricted to Boreal Zone."
Specimens collected by me at Boulder extend its range through the Transition zone.
Corynorbinus maorotis pallescens.

specimens of Eptesicus fuscus from this region^^ have the color and size typical of the species, the new form must be considered as a distinct species and not merely a geographical race of fuscus.
The probable origin of this species is a matter of some interest.
Occurring in the same territory and occupying the same habitat as its near relative fuscus, neither the geographic isolation nor selection theory seem to offer a satisfactory explanation.
Neither the mutation nor orthogenesis theory finds any difficulty in these facts.
Moreover we have here an apparent exception to Jordan's law of geminate species.
Further information as to the distribution of this species is very desirable.^^ In conclusion I wish to thank the authorities of the Field Museum, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and the U. S. National Museum for the identification of much of my material; and the latter institution especially for its loan of valuable material.
