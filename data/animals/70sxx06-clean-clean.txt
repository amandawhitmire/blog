NEW GENERIC NAMES FOR UPPER CRETACEOUS GASTROPODA.
BY BRUCE WADE.
In a recent paper entitled New and Little Known Gastropoda from the Upper Cretaceous of Tennessee published in the Proceedings of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for September 1917 pp.
2803C4 there were several errors which crept in because of the necessity of preparing the paper for publication after the writer left Baltimore and had entered the U. S. Artillery service.
It is the purpose of this brief note to rectify these mistakes and omissions.
The family name Fusidce should have been inserted over the genus Falsifusus on page 284 and similarly the family name BusyGonidce should have been inserted over the genus BolteneUa on page 285.
The generic term Hyllus page 281 has been found to be much preoccupied and the new name Parafusus is here proposed to take its place the type thus becoming Parafusus calUlateras and the second species Parafusus coloratus.
Similarl the term Scohina page 286 is preoccupied and for the latter the name Haplovoluta is proposed the type species becoming Haplovoluta bicarinata.
The new Buccinoid genus Seminola is not regarded as being preoccupied by the Coleopteroid genus Seminolus of Mulsant 1869 although the two are dangerously alike and a different term would have been proposed in the first instance if the writer had been aware of Mulsant's genus.
