301 A CATALOGUE OF THE ERIGONE OF NORTH AMERICA WITH NOTES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES.
BY CYRUS R. CROSBY.
The larger part of the material upon which the notes included in this paper are based is in the collection of Cornell University.
This collection includes in addition to the general collection of the University the following special collections  Many of the specimens studied by Nathan Banks in the preparation of The Spider Fauna of the Upper Cayuga Lake Basin Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila. 1892 a collection purchased by the Entomological Department of Cornell University of Dr. William Fox a collection made by Prof. J. H. Cornstock in the Southern States and a collection made by the writer chiefly near Ithaca New York.
The sequence of genera with one exception is that of Simon's Histoire Naturelle des Araignees.
As many of the original descriptions are very brief I have given in the notes such measurements and facts as may be of value in determining the generic position of the species.
The types of the new species are in the Cornell University collection.
I wish to thank Prof. Comstock under whose direction this paper was prepared for the opportunity of using the University collection and for many favors and valuable suggestions.
I am under obligations to Dr. A. D. MacGillivray and Dr. W. A. Riley for kindly encouragement and many specimens to Mr. J. H. Emerton for the loan of specimens to Dr. William Fox for the loan to the Department of Entomology of Cornell University of parts of types of his species of Ceraticelus to Mr. P. B. Powell for specimens from California and to many others for specimens of which no record was made.

Notes and Descriptions of New Species.
In the following notes all measurements are given in millimeters.
In determining the curvature of the rows of eyes the posterior row is viewed from above and the anterior from before.
CERATINELLA Em.
Emerton Trans.
Conn.
Ac. VI p. 32 proposed the name Ceratinella for the genus Ceratina Menge preoccupied.
The species described by Emerton under this name with the exception of C. hrunnea Em. did not belong to Menge's genus Ceratina type C. hrevis Wid.
For these species E. Simon Ar.
Fr. V p. 595 proposed the name Ceraticelus and later Hist.
Nat.
Ar. I p. 651 designated C. fissiceps Cambr.
as its type.
In 1893 Banks Jour.
N. Y. Ent.
Soc I p. 130 considering that Emerton did not propose Ceratinella to replace Ceratina but rather to designate the species which he placed under it proposed Ceratinodes for Menge's genus and has since retained the name Ceratinella for the American species.
Ceratinella is easily distinguished from Ceraticelus by the double curve in the claw of the chelicerse.

CERATICELUS E. Sim.
Banks Jour.
N. Y. Ent.
Soc I p. 130 proposed the genus Idionella for C. formosa Banks based on the position of the dorsal sclerite of the abdomen a character of less than specific value in some species of the group.
In certain species of the group this sclerite is wholly lacking in some individuals while strongly developed in others of the same sex.
The figures and notes on the species described by Fox are from mounts of male palpi taken from the type specimens.

This species is very closely allied to C. fissiceps Em.
In the male the posterior lateral eyes are nearer the posterior median and the anterior lateral eyes are considerably nearer the anterior median than in fissiceps.
In the female the posterior median eyes are separated by their diameter and the anterior lateral eyes are much nearer to the median than in fissiceps.

EXECHOPHYSIS.
The following species is placed here with considerable doubt.
There is great variation in the amount of chitinization of the dorsal sclerite of the abdomen and also to a less degree in the form of the lobes of the head.
It differs markedly from Ceraticelus in the form of the male palpus.

Prosopotheca formosa Banks.
Banks Jour.
N. Y. Ent.
Soc I p. 125 has stated that Tmeticus luxuosus Banks is the male of Lophocarenum venustum Banks.
I have compared the types of Lophocarenum venustum and Cornicularia formosa Banks and feel sure they are the same species.
This species is related to Erigone by the apophysis on the patella of the palpus.
It lacks however the teeth on the margin of the cephalothorax and outer margin of the chelicerae and its eyes are not arranged as in that genus.
In the form of the sternum and cephalothorax it is related to Prosopotheca but the auditory hair of the fourth metatarsus is on the distal fourth.

Lower margin of furrow with two teeth close together near the base.
Sternum light brown darker on the posterior point which is narrower than the length of the posterior coxae.
Endites like the stermma lighter near the tip.
Abdomen dark gray with two oval coalescent lighter spots on the front part and a light area near the tip under side dark gray with a reddishyellow transverse quadrangular band midway between the spinnerets and the epigynum.
Legs light yellow darkened at base on the first pair the dark marking extends to near the end of the femur on the second to the middle on the third only a short distance and is much lighter.
On the fourth pair there is a small dark spot on the under side of the base of the femur.
Spines weak and rather short.
No auditory hair on fourth metatarsus.

Clypeus a little wider than ocular area.
This species has been referred with doubt to this genus by Simon.
It is related to TypJiochrcestus in having the posterior median eyes nearer each other than to the lateral.
This arrangement however may be the result of the abnormal development of the head in the male.
In the absence of female specimens by which alone this point could be decided I leave it doubtfully in Trachelocamptus.
HYPOMMA. '
Dicyphus Menge preoccupied.
I have been unable to examine specimens of the species included in this genus.
Dicyphus was founded by Menge Prevss.
Spirm. p. 221 1869 for three species in the following order tumidus cilunculus and bicuspidatus without indicating the type.
In 1884 Simon Ar.
Fr. V p. 546 designated tumidus   hitubercidotus as the type.
Dahl Monographie der ErigoncArten p. 87 1886 proposed the genus Hypomma for bifrons Blackw.
and bituberculatus Wid. without indicating the type.
Chyzer and Kulczynski Ar.
Hung. pp.
99 100 seem to consider bituberculatus as the type of Hypomma and cornutus as the type of Dicyphus.
As Dicyphus is preoccupied in the Hemiptera Fieber Wien.
Ent.
Monats. II p. 327 1858 it is necessary to use the next oldest name applied to that group of species.
This seems to be Hypomma.
Simon has placed bituberculatus under Gonatium.

Introduction.
The critical study of the development of Gastropod shell ornamentation has until recent years attracted the attention of few scientists in the United States.
In Europe as early as 1889 Koken made a carefia study of Paleeozoic Gastropods.
This was followed m 1896 by the Countess von Linden's study of the ornamentation and color patterns in Voluta Strombus and Coyius.
In the United States the first use of gastropod shell characters in the study of phylogeny occurs in the short notes of Heilprin' in 1888 dealing with the phylogeny of Fulgur perversum and Strombus leidyi and of Ueidy and Wilcox on the ancestry of Fulgur perversum.
In 1900 A. W. Grabau presented a thesis at Harvard University dealing with the phylogeny of Fusus and allied forms.
In June 1902 the writer applied the methods of the Countess von Linden to a study of the Fulgurs and later in the same year A. W. Grabau published a paper dealing with the general features of gastropod shell development.
In 1903 Prof. Grabau discussed the phylogenetic relations of the Fulgurs and in the following year published an elaborate phylogenetic study of Fusus
In most of the above papers there is an attempt made to compare ontogeny with palfEontogeny dealing therefore with both recent and fossil forms.
The individuals of species are studied from the earliest 1 Koken E Ueber die Entwicklung der Gastropoden vom Cambrium bis zur Trias '' jdhrh.

Where phylogenetic trees have been constructed they have been based on the principle that the mdividual in its development repeats in its early stages shell features which are found in the adult individuals of its ancestors.
The authors have for the most part followed the principles applied and the laws formulated by Hyatt in his classic studies of the Cephalopoda.
In any phylogenetic study of the gastropod shell acceleration of the characters plays an important part.
With the exception of Fusus and Voluta most of the genera studied have been rather highly specialized and accelerated types like Fulgur and Strotnbus.
In such forms many of the stages have been hurried back into the earlv whorls slurred over or lost. 
' The writer feels that a detailed study of the shell features in some species of Volutilithes as Volutilithes petrosus of the American Eocene may add to our knowledge of the normal order in which such features are evolved.
Several species of Volutilithes go through quite a number of stages of development in ornamentation and there is little acceleration.
Each stage of course does not necessarily represent an adult ancestor for at present it is not known how much unequal acceleration of .
ancestral characters has come into play yet nevertheless the writer feels that here we have a fairly normal and even succession of developmental features.
The occurrence of certain characteristics with considerable constancy m the later whorls of many individuals of Volutilithes petrosus has led the author to consider such features in other genera of gastropods.
These features will be treated in the sections of this paper entitled Senility and Senile Offshoots from Main Ancestral Stems.
The results of this later investigation are applied to Fulgur carica in an endeavor to unravel its ancestry.
Normal Progressive Development.
In recording the characters which occur at different periods in the growth of any gastropod shell it is necessary to be exact and this frequently results in the use of terms which appear arbitrary.
The writer has throughout this paper endeavored as far as possible to apply the terms previously in use.
Markings on the outside of the whorl which run parallel or nearly parallel to the suture are described as spiral while those running across these spirals are described as transverse.
The transverse markings which first appear are referred to as transverse ribs or simply as ribs.
When in later stages finer transverse markings appear between the ribs they are described as riblets.
Here the term is used principally for convenience the actual difference between ribs and riblets being one of degree.
The angle which appears early on the rounded whorl is termed the shoulder angle.
On the ribs especially at the shoulder angle may occur nodes or tubercles.
These in the early whorls are mere rounded knobs but in the later whorls they become larger higher and sharper and may therefore be referred to as spines.
The writer considers that the difference between the small rounded tubercle of the early whorls and the large sharp spine of the later whorl is one merely of degree.
The word spine is therefore used throughout this paper simply in a descriptive sense and implies no difference from the early tubercle except that it is larger and sharper.
Both are produced by the same fold of the mantle and every gradation between the two is observable.
As stated in the Introduction Volutilithes has been chosen as an illustration on account of the normal and even course of its ontogeny.
The stages are often very distinct and frequently are all represented down to the senile condition in the later whorls.
In addition Volutilithes petrosus is of unusual interest on account of its individual variation and its division into more or less definite races which exhibit different stages in the specialization of characters.
In the early stages of Volutilithes petrosus there is a varying number of smooth rounded whorls but as a rule there are three or four.
The first ornamental feature to appear on the rounded whorl is the transverse rib which at first is simple without tubercles and usually decidedly curved.
Soon the simple ribs are followed by uncurved ribs bearing as a rule two tubercles but sometimes more than two.
One of these tubercles is situated at the suture the other at the position of the shoulder angle.
If more tubercles are present they are below the shoulder angle tubercle.
Sometimes the suture tubercle and the shoulder angle tubercle are of the same size but often they are of unequal size and then it is usually the suture tubercle which is at first the larger.
The suture tubercle however soon degenerates and becomes obsolete while the shoulder angle tubercle increases in importance and by its increase in size and sharpness makes the spine of the later whorls.
Coincident with or shortly after the appearance of the tubercles on the ribs a more or less well marked shoulder angle develops.
As the shoulder angle tubercles become larger sharper and more prominent the transverse ribs degenerate.
This process begins first above the 23 shoulder angle where sometimes all trace of the rib has disappeared when below the angle the rib is still well marked.
As a rule when the tubercles become very high and sharp spines the ribs practically disappear.
When fine spirals cover the early whorls below the shoulder angle they are apt to disappear near the shoulder angle first in the later adult whorls.
As the shell grows these fine spirals are found in a more and more anterior position until in old age only a few occur on the branchial siphon.
This briefly simis up the more important changes which are passed through in the development of most individuals of Volutilithes petrosus and many other species of the genus.
Many individuals and some races of Volutilithes petrosus pass through further stages of development but these are all of a gerontic character and may be now more fittiniily discussed under the following section.
Senility.
In widely separated genera of gastropods the writer has observed that similar features are frequently found in the last whorl or in the last few whorls.
These features are never followed in any gastropod by other and different ones but are the last ornamental characters which the shell acquires.
They are the marks of old age or senility.
Many species and even genera and families never exliibit them for in the Palaeozoic they are rare and in the Mesozoic they are uncommon.
In Tertiary and Recent time however few large families of gastropods are lacking in senile representatives.
These representatives may be genera species or individuals.
Individual Senility.
 In many species the vast majority of individuals die at the period of mature shell ornamentation.
Senile characters are found only in an occasional specimen which as a rule is either a very large old one or else a dwarfed or pathologic individual. In individual senility the senile features are seldom accelerated to any extent  that is they are as a rule found in the last whorl or in the latter part of the last whorl.
Specific Senility.
 Often all the individuals of a species will show signs of senility in the last whorl or in the last few whorls.
This senile ornamentation of the species is more apt to be accelerated than the senile ornamentation of the individual  or in other words it occurs earlier in the growth of the shell  A similar condition has been noted by Hyatt for the Cephalopoda  Biological Relations of the Jurassic Ammonites Proc.
Bost.
Soc.
Nat.
Hist. Vol.
XVII 1874 p. 239.
Generic Senility.
 Here all the species of a genus will exhilDit signs of senility and the generic senility is more accelerated than the specific.
Similarly senility may extend to the genera of a family and if as is probably the case the VerinetidcB are senile we have the characters occurring early in the growth of shell with the result that the forms comprising the family differ in appearance to a marked degree from the normal gastropod .
The marks of senility may be conveniently grouped under several heads.
Two or three of them have been mentioned by Hyatt Grabau and other authors and these are merely noted in the present paper for the sake of completeness.
The wi'iter knows of no case in which all of the characters are found together.
Frequently only one will indicate that the individual species or genus has passed its prime but more often two or more senile characters occur.
As old age comes on the marks of senility appear but not necessarily all at the same time.
Usually one character will appear in the growth of the shell slightly ahead of another character.
Sometimes one of the senile characters will be much accelerated and become prominent at a comparatively early stage while the others will be found on the last whorl only.
The wTiter regards the following as marks of senility  1.
Passing of the shoulder tubercles or spines into a shoulder keel.
2.
Swelling on the anterior siphon.
3.
Protrusion of the mantle in the region of the anal siphon producing a smoothing of the preceding whorl by a shelly overgrowth.
4.
Encroachment of the anal siphon upward on the preceding whorl.
5.
Stromboid form to the outer lip of the aperture.
6.
Tendency toward loose coiling.
7.
Irregularity of growih lines.
8.
Thickening of the shell.
9.
Tendency to form a smooth and rounded whorl.
10.
Recurrent or discontinuous ornamentation.
1.
Passing of the shoulder tubercles or spines into o shoulder keel.
 This process is well shown in such forms as Fulgur carica and Volutilithes petrosus where little acceleration has occurred.
The change takes place by a shortening of the interval between spine formation with the result that the spines are nearer each other.
The growth lines on which the spines are situated are thus brought close together.
The spines become lower in height but longer in a spiral direction until they fuse together into a continuous ridge so that the final result of the process is a shoulder keel without definite spines.
In Fulgur canalicidatum acceleration has thrown the spines back into the early whorls and they are mere tubercles.
Their transformation into a shoulder keel is however essentially similar to the change in F. carica.
The tubercles become longer in a spiral direction but lower in height and soon merge into a shoulder keel.
2 Swelling on the anterior siphon.
 In senile individuals and species the mantle in the region of the anterior or branchial siphon not infrequently bulges at a certain point.
As the animal grows this bulging of the mantle produces a swollen ridge in the shell.
The long diameter of this swelling runs obliquely to the line of the shoulder angle and in a more anterior direction.
Numerous dissections of Fulgur carica ha'e failed to show a cause for this mantle swelling.
The two above marks of senility  that is the passing of the spines into a shoulder keel and the swelling on the anterior siphon  are both well shown in old individuals of the Fulgur carica of our New Jersey coast.
These two characters together with a third the tendency for the anal siphon to encroach upward on the preceding whorl are the last ornamental features which occur on the oldest individuals.
A wellmarked sexual dimorphism occurs in this species.
The fullgrown males are considerably smaller than the fullgrown females.
The old males and old females show the senile characters above mentioned  and the difference in the size of the senile individuals of the different sexes furnishes a I'eady method of determ'ning sex without reference to the soft parts.
These observations were made on a large series of Fulgur carica' 3.
Protrusion of the mantle in the region of the anal siphon producing a smoothing of the preceding whorl by a shelly overgrowth.
 This is beautifully illustrated by several races of Volutilithes petrosus.
In the later whorls the mantle in the region of the anal siphon protrudes and tends to wrap itself aroimd the preceding whorl.
In the early stages of the process we have little more than a smoothing of the preceding whorl.
The mantle soon passes up over the spines of the preceding whorl and the shelly deposit becomes thicker and thicker completely obliterating ornamentation and making it in many cases extremely difficult to count the whorls.
Every stage of the process can be traced in individual development while several races make a series from forms in which the mantle has been little protruded to forms in which it has covered in the preceding whorl obliterating ornamental features.
It does not necessarily follow that these races in question make a phylogenetic succession but they unquestionably represent stages in the 1 Proc.

The protrusion of the mantle onto the preceding whorl is often accompanied by an encroachment of the anal siphon upward onto the preceding whorl.
There is evidently a close relation between the swelling on the anterior siphon and the protrusion of the mantle on the preceding whorl in the region of the anal siphon  for as the latter feature becomes stronger the former declines.
The races of Volulilithes petrosus above mentioned illustrate this fact perfectly.
They range from forms with a wellmarked swelling to others with no swelling and in one race with an extreme mantle protrusion there is a depression in place of a swelling.
As the swelling has been diminishing there has been a corresponding increase in the amount of protrusion of the mantle on the preceding whorl in the region of the anal siphon.
4.
Encroachment of the anal siphon upward on the preceding whorl. This often accompanies the preceding mark of senility and is evidently produced by the same causes.
It is well shown in Volutilithes petrosus and in Fulgur carica also in Strombus and Aporrhais where it is accompanied by the winglike flaring of the outer lip of the aperture.
5.
Stromhoid form to the outer lip of the aperture.
 This is a flaring winglike extension of the outer lip of the aperture and is found in Strombus Aporrhais and a few other forms.
In Strombus it is often accompanied by a thickening of the shell by a bending of the branchial siphon upward or backward by the encroachment of the anal siphon upward onto the preceding whorl and by recurrent ornamentation Strombus leidyi.
6.
Tendency toward loose coiling.
 In many gastropods the later whorls are not closely applied against the preceding whorls.
In other words the coiling becomes loose.
Ecphora Ropana and some species of Murex do not show signs of uncoiling until well along in life.
In such forms as Vermetus however the process is further advanced and all trace of the original spiral condition is lost at an early date the shell becoming a mere irregular tube.
7.
Irregularity of growth lines.
 In many gastropods Volutilithes petrosus is a good example the final senile stages are characterized by a thickening and irregularity of the fine lines of growth.
Thi character goes hand in hand with the thickening of the shell the passing of the spines into a shoulder keel recmrent ornamentation and other senile features.
8.
Thickening of the shell.
 This is a character which occurs in the senile stages of manj'diverse groups of gastropods.
It is usually accompanied by other senile features and is probably more widely distributed than any other mark of senility.
352 May 9.
Tendency to jorm a smooth and rounded whorl. In many gastropods the later whorls tend to become rounded and more or less smooth losing all ornamental features except growth lines and perhaps also fine spirals.
In many individuals and varieties of Fulgur 'pyrum and related forms the shoulder keel stage is followed by a condition in which the whorl is roimded the shoulder keel becoming fainter and fainter vmtil it is not discernible.
In many gastropods this rounded stage is accompanied by a thickening of the shell but in others the shell actually becomes thinner.
As the early whorls of most gastropods are rounded it is possible that this mark of senility may be regarded as a reciurence of features of the same nature as the mark of senility next to be considered.

10.
Recurrent or discontinuous ornamentation.
 This is a term which may be applied to the discontinuity produced by the repetition at a later stage of a style of ornamentation characterizing an earlier stage.
Thus spines or tubercles which are found on the early whorls disappear for a few whorls but are repeated as a secondary series in old age.
The development of secondary spines is well shown in Fulgur maximum.
In most examples of this very variable species and its near relatives the shoulder angle tubercles are soon lost and only reappear again in the later whorls where they are spinelike and accompanied by features of extreme senility.
Sometimes the arrangement of the shoulder angle spines may be considered as discontinuous that is where an occasional 1905.
353 spine is met with on a rounded whorl.
Here as above the condition is accompanied by other senile features.
Recurrent or discontinuous ornamentation is also met with in the sinistral Fulgurs of the Miocene in not a few Stromhs and in some individuals of Volutiliihes dalli.
In the last mentioned the breaks in a particular style of ornamentation may occur early in life but the shell always shows senile characters in its last whorls.
Senile Offshoots from Main Ancestral Stems.
In no group of gastropods are senile offshoots from main lines of descent so well marked as in the Fulgurs.
The modern Fulgur carica of our New Jersey coast is a simple little accelerated type which however shows welldefined senile characters in its last whorl.
In the Yorktown Miocene of North Carolina occiucertain formg which were described by Conrad as Fulgur striatum.
Some of these small forms are undoubtedly the young of Fulgur maximum as can be seen in the early degeneration of the tubercles but others whose tubercles increase in size can hardly be distinguished from the young of Fulgur carica.
It is from these latter or from very closely allied forms that the modern New Jersey Fulgur carica is descended.
The main line of the ancestry of Fulgur carica may be represented as follows  Miocene.
Pliocene.
Recent.
F. fusiformis Ancestral F.canco or a nearly alprobably included in liedform.
Conrad's i.
striatum.
F. carica.
N. J. F. carica.
This has been a slow and even evolution marked by increase in size stronger and continuous spine development and finally in the old individuals of Fulgur carica by the appearance of the senile characters in the last whorl which have already been referred to.
In the Yorktown Miocene the Fulgur maximum branch Was evolved.
As can be seen by examining the young Fulgur maximum it owes its ancestry to the ancestral Fulgur carica.
It differs from this form however in the early degeneration of the shoulder angle tubercles  a tendency which soon results in a rounded lirate and relatively thin whorl.
This spineless condition continues for some time but in the later whorls secondary spines appear.
This recurrent ornamentation is accompanied by shell thickening encroachment upward of the anal siphon on the preceding whorl and the sweUing on the anterior siphon  all senile features.
This is the method by which most of the indiA'idiials recognized as Fulgur maximum have been evolved.
Sometimes however recurrent ornamentation is only slightly marked the spines occurring at long intervals on the rounded whorls.
The whole assemblage shows every indication of being a senile offshoot.
Every large individual shows senile characters.
The main Fulgur maximum branch including the forms described as F. maximum F. tritonis F. filosum becomes extinct at the end of the Miocene.
Shortly after the divergence of the Fulgur maximum branch from the main Fulgur carica stem a series of forms with rounded whorls diverged from the maximum stock.
Their young are much like the young of Fulgur maximum but the tubercles degenerate at a more early period.
This short tubercled stage Ls followed by thin rounded spineless whorls in the vast majority of individuals resulting in the form known as Fulgur rapum.
A few senile individuals of Fulgur rapum exhibit a thickening of the last whorl and recurrent or discontinuous ornamentation in the shape of secondary spines.
Fulgur rapum becomes extinct with the end of the Pliocene.
In Pliocene or Recent times a branch has been evolved from the Fulgur carica main stem which has resulted in such forms as Fulgur eliceans.
These are senile and exhibit an acceleration of characters accompanied by very high spines.
These spines are not as numerous as in Fulgur carica.
They sometimes tend to pass into a shoulder keel though less often than in Fulgur carica.
In other respects however these forms show extreme senility  the swelling on the anterior siphon is very large the shell is very heavy and the anal siphon encroaches upward.
The phylogeny of Fulgur carica and allied forms may be represented as follows 1905.
355 eg a   03 03 1 to 03 a o o .
OS From the above study the writer is led to beUeve that there are two modes in which evohitional features may develop.
First they may develop slowly and evenly in the growth of the individual ontogeny and in the evolution of the race in geologic time palseontogeny  .
Such forms are stable and persist for long periods of time.
Second the same evolutional features may develop in the same order but more rapidly one feature following another in quick succession in the ontogeny and paltEontogeny.
Such forms are apt to be short lived soon becoming senile and dying out.
Where the rate of development of evolutional features is rapid we find that some features are slurred over while other features may be more exaggerated than the corresponding features in the forms whose rate of development of characters is slow.
Of course acceleration or the throwing back of characters into the ontogeny is a natural result of an increased evolutional rate.
Further we cannot escape the conclusion that there are times in the evolution of a group of organisms palseontogeny which might be termed periods of pliancy.
In these the simple generalized members of the main ancestral stem can be easily moulded.
At such periods of pliancy we may expect to find first forms which follow out the succession of developmental features as in the main stock but at a more rapid rate becoming senile and extinct and second forms which acquire characters of a more or less permanent nature and which do not go through the same succession of developmental features which is found in the main ancestral stock.
These latter forms make new stocks or in other words they go to form new species genera etc.
Therefore at every period of pliancy in a stock we have on the one hand new species and on the other senile offshoots.
In the forms above considered that is the Fulgurs the numerous senile offshoots far outnumber the few but persistent stable forms.
The following diagram may be used  1905.
357 Senile offshoots representing rapid evolution short Uved .
Adventitious Senility.
An acceleration of shell characters produced by accident or by pathologic conditions occms in species of widely separated groups of gastropods.
Hyatt observed that  a wound and its results whatever they may be .... is primarily a severe shock to the system which lays additional biudens upon the powers of growth and is usually followed if severe by retrogressive metamorphoses or premature old age.
Individuals of Volutilithes petrosus whose shells in the later whorls The Genesis of the Tertiary Species of Planorbis at Steinheim p. 15 Anniversary Memoirs of the Boston Society of Natural History 1880. have been subjected to breakage often exhibit a sudden and sharp development of senile features.
The shell gets heavy the growth lines become irregular and the spines tend to pass into a shoulder keel.
An individual of Ecphora quadricostata collected by the writer from the Maryland Miocene exhibits acceleration produced by accident very clearly.
The accident occurred to the shell during the development of the third whorl.
From this point on the rate of the development of later shell features increases and is much more rapid than in normal individuals.
The individual in question never became mature only attaining five whorls.
A normal specimen with this number of whorls has practically no indication of loose coiling in the region of the colimiella and the spiral folds are simple.
The abnormal individual in question shows plainly a loose coiling in the columella region and the spiral folds approximate those of more mature individuals.
Toose coiling is as a rule not marked in normal individuals of this species imtil the seventh or eighth whorl.
A specimen of Fulgur canaliculatwn collected at Longport New Jersey exhibits well the acceleration of characters produced by breakage in the shell.
 In the canaliculate Fulgurs the transversely rilbed condition occurs very early and is followed by a few angular whorls bearing tubercles on the shoulder angle.
These tubercles soon pass into a shoulder keel and this in turn disappears and leaves the whorl rounded in the more accelerated forms such as Fulgur pyrum.
Fulgur canaliculatum however never entirely loses the shoulder keel which marks its last stage of development.
In the specimen under consideration the accident occurred when the shell was young on an angular whorl having the tubercles so characteristic of the early stages of Fulgur canaliculatum.
After the break the shoulder angle is not reproduced but the whorls continue to the aperture of a shape much as in Fulgur pyrum.
Just after the break there is apparently an attempt to reproduce the tubercles on the rounded surface of the whorl.
This attempt was however unsuccessful and the whorl continued smooth.
An examination of the soft parts showed the specimen to be identical with normal male individuals of the species except that the shoulder angle is not present on the mantle.
No peculiarity in the mantle edge or other soft parts could be detected which would account for the change in shell ornamentation.
The acceleration in this case has caused the dropping out of that marked character of the later whorls of the species namely the un Smith Burnett Proc.

On the other hand it has introduced a senUe character which occurs normally in a near relative if not an actual descendant of Fulgur canaliculatum namely Fulgur pijrum Summary.
In most Mesozoic and Cenozoic gastropods changes in ornamentation occur in going from the earlier to the later whorls.
A normal succession of developmental changes may be observed which varies little in widely separated groups but most families show certain peculiarities in the succession which distinguish them from other families .
Infancy  youth and maturity are represented by their peculiar styles of ornamentation in the ontogeny of an individual  but these stages with their characteristic styles of sculpture cannot always be correlated with the adults of a previous geologic time.
This latter discrepancy may be due in part to the imperfection of the geologic record  but the writer inclines to the behef that the unequal acceleration of characters plays an important part and that features which occurred at the same time in an ancestor are apt to be widely separated in the ontogeny of a descendant.
In the last whorl or in the last few whorls of many gastropods of different groups we find the characters of senility.
These characters or marks of senility do not necessarily appear together in the ontogeny at exactly the same time.
Some occur far in advance of others that is to say there is frequently an unequal acceleration of the senile characters.
These senile features several of which are as a rule found together are the last characters which occur on the shell for their appearance is the forerunner of the death of the individual .
As might be expected  senile species or genera of fossil gastropods never transmit descendants to later geologic formations but represent the end members of short branches on the phylogenetic tree.
The writer believes from his researches that the forces of evolution sometimes work rapidly and sometimes work slowly and that the forms in which the evolutional rate is rapid are bizarre senile offshoots.
On the other hand forms which have a long time range go through a slow evolution though the developmental features and even the order 3 There is good reason for believing that F. pyrum and its numerous varietie ire descended from a Miocene form which is either identical with or closely aUied

Lastly an acceleration of characters may result from some accident which occurs to an individual  and in this case we may find a sudden appearance of senile characters which may occur in the normal ontogeny of the species at a later period or they may be extraspecific  that is to say never occurring in the ontogeny of the species but found in some senile offshoot from the same stock.
