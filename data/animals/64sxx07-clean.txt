ORTHOPTERA GRYLLID.E FOUND IN NORTH AMERICA NORTH OF THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA.
BY JAMES A. G. REHN AND MORGAN HEBARD.
The group Mogoplistii forms a division of the subfamily Myrmecophilince and comprises eleven genera and over fifty species described from localities well distributed over the warmer regions of the earth.
All of the species are of small size very delicate and covered with minute easily abraded scales for which reasons they appear to have been but little collected and in consequence most of the species were described from but little and often badly damaged material.
In studying an extepsive series of North American specimens of this group we found it necessary to go so deeply .into the relationship of the various genera and species that it became incumbent on us to analyze all of the genera described to this date to construct a new key for all of the genera and also erect four new genera.
In addition to this we were confronted with a great amount of confusion in regard to the characters and extent of certain genera and also some complicated specific synonymy.
As these facts are best discussed in a chronological sequence we have summarized the history of the names here treated.
History.
In 1839 Serville erected the genus Mogoplistes 1 on the species M. brunneus from southern Europe Sardinia.
Guerin in 1844 described the genus Ornebius 2 basing it on two new species 0. xanthopterus from Mauritius and 0. nigripalpis from Pondicherry the former of which has been selected as the genotype by Kirby.
The same author in 1849 erected the genus Ectatoderus 3 on a new species E. nigriventris from Abyssinia.
In 1855 Costa based a new genus Arachnocephalus on a species from Naples this author being 1 Hist.

fully acquainted with Mogoplistes with which he compared his new genus.
Philippi in 1863 described the genus Microgryllus as a subgenus of Gryllus placing in it the two new species Gryllus pallipes and griseus from Chili to the former of which the name has since been limited.
Scudder in the year 1869 based a new genus Cycloptilum 6 on a single new species C. squamosum from Texas while at the same time he described another new species from Lower California as Mogoplistes occidentalis.
Brunner in 1873 proposed the name Physoblemma 7 for several unnamed species which name is clearly shown by the text to be an exact equivalent of the older Arachnocephalus Costa a genus apparently unknown to him at that time.
Saussure in 1874 described a new species from Cuba 8 which he referred to Scudder's genus Cycloptilum as C. americanum later emending the spelling to Cycloptilus.
9 The same author in 1877 erected the genus Liphoplus 10 for two new species L. novarce from Tahiti and L. guerinianus from an unknown localitythe former of which has been selected as type of the genus by Kirby.
Bruner in 1891 described a species as Cycloptilum using Saussure's emended spelling Cycloptilus borealis from Nebraska 11 while the next year Redtenbacher described a species from St. Vincent West Indies which he called Ectatoderus antillarum.
12 Saussure in 1897 in the Biologia ls described two new species from Mexico as Ectatoderus aztecus and Liphoplus mexicanus while in the same year Scudder described a species from southern Florida based on a single female as Mogosiplistus emended Mogoplistes slossoni.
u In 1905 the present authors described a new species from a single male from southern Florida as Liphoplus zebra 1 ' while Morse in the same year based a new species Mogisoplistus 1  emended Mogoplistes barbovri on a single female from the Bahamas.

13 first that Ectatoderus is quite distinct from any North American form which has been referred to it.
The greatly elongate pronotum of the male covering by far the greater portion of the abdomen is a character found in none of our species while the form of the caudal metatarsus is quite distinctive.
The second fact is that Mogoplistes is equally unrepresented in our fauna the reference of forms from North America to this genus being due to the fact that no males were examined by the authors of those species.
In all such cases we have examined the types and unquestionably identical males these examinations proving that the species are not at all related to Mogoplistes brunneus the type of that genus.
The third fact is that  Cycloptilus as understood by Saussure is not Cycloptilum Scudder the characters of the pronotum palpi and limbs being very different.
This misinterpretation was doubtless due to a certain amount of vagueness in Scuclder's original description but much uncertainty as to what characters were really diagnostic of Cycloptilum resulted from Saussure's error.
The latter's key to the genera of the group 17 contained two groups of very misleading characters first the division or nondivision of the interantennal protuberance and second the elongate caudal metatarsus with its nonsulcate and nonserrate dorsum in Cycloptilus.''
The former feature is of considerable value as a major section in a generic key but as that vertical division is represented more or less clearly in a few genera by a sulcus or in several by a decided deep incision it is necessary to qualify the word division.
Saussure is completely in error in the characters which he gives for Cycloptilum the typical material of the type of the genus being very different in these features.
18 The emphasis placed on these two sets of characters was responsible for the present authors describing Liphoplus zebra as a member of that genus when it is really a Cycloptilum.
The presence of a weak but apparent sulcus on the face and the sulcate and serrate metatarsus easily ran the species into the genus Liphoplus as placed in Saussure's key.

The very elongate caudal metatarsus which is very sparsely and very delicately armed dorsad will immediately separate this genus from the other genera of the group.
Under an ordinary hand lens the metatarsus appears unarmed dorsad and this is doubtless the reason Saussure accentuated this character thus differentiating it from the allied genera but under a moderatepower microscope the margins are seen to be supplied with delicate cheetiform spines.
However this spination is most subtle and is entirely different in character from that found in any of the allied genera which all have these spines more decidedly dentiform often contrastingly colored and always truly serrate in their arrangement.
The extremely slender metatarsus is so striking a character that it will at once serve to distinguish members of this genus.

24 It is possible that the Venezuelan material may not be identical.
Synonymy.
 Saussure's erroneous association of this very distinct generic group with Cycloptilum Scudder beclouded the characters of true Cycloptilum preventing some authors from recognizing the latter as Scudder failed to mention the character of the dorsal margins of the caudal metatarsus.
Remarks.
 We have before us two females of this species from Mexican territory which show no character of difference from the original description  in fact agreeing in every particular.
It is interesting to find material from such widely separated and different localities agreeing so thoroughly.

This species is closely related to C. antillarum but differs from it in having the interantennal protuberance more produced and bulbous the joints of the maxillary palpi more elongate with the terminal joint more roundly and less obliquely truncate.
The pronotum is heavier in both sexes and considerably longer proportionately in the male.
The caudal tibiae and metatarsi are very slightly longer in proportion to the length of the caudal femora the caudal metatarsi having normally on each dorsal margin ten or more serrations.
In the male the subgenital plate is much as in antillarum but in the female it is gently arcuatoconvergent laterad broadly arcuatotruncate distad with no trace of emargination.

 As all but the two adult females are dried alcoholic specimens our color notes refer to these two specimens only.
In ground coloration they are much like antillarum but the dorsum of the abdomen is wholly black.
The scaly covering of the type is in perfect condition and shows the insect to be thickly covered with scales as in antillarum but in this case the scales are metallicbronze in color.
In this specimen there is a cephalic bar of dark brown which crosses the eye but is not continued on the pronotum in the two other adult specimens both of which have almost entirely lost their scaly covering no trace of such a bar exists.
The maxillary palpi are dark brown and are covered with light hairs.
Distribution.
 The known range of this species is confined to Lower California.
Remarks.
 As noted under antillarum the female in the later stages of the nymphal condition has dentiform spines on each side of the ovipositor sheath these are situated distad along the ventral margin of the upper section of the valves and in the specimen before us are five in number on each side.
The adults all have a distinct tympanum on the cephalic face of the cephalic tibiae but this tympanum is not present in any of the nymphs.

4.3  28 These measurements are almost exactly the same as those given by Redtenbacher in his original description.
The large size of St. Vincent specimens may prove to be the result of tropical influence.
These measurements plainly show that in the United States the species reaches its greatest size at the northern limit of its range and that it gradually and constantly decreases in size southward although in all of the large series from a single locality there exists a great amount of size variation.
Specimens from Cabanas Cuba are very much like those from Key West.
Color Notes.
 Ground color of dorsal surface of pronotum head mesonotum metanotum and sometimes first abdominal segments russet in some individuals varying to marsbrown.

caudal femora often dark.
Abdomen black frequently marked above on edges of segments with brown this usually more pronounced in female sex and females are occasionally found with whole dorsum of abdomen suffused with that color.
Maxillary palpi usually color of under portions of body sometimes darkly suffused toward distal extremity of last segment.
Specimens covered with scales usually appear wholly silverydrab or silverywhite as all portions of the insect excepting the eyes face and feet are heavily scaled.
Specimens frequently have these scales rubbed off in such a way that the insect would at first glance appear to belong to a distinct species.
An inconspicuous dark postocular bar is often to be found on the head in the present species  but is never continued on the pronotum.
Distribution In the United States this species is found within the boundaries of the Lower Austral Zone the most northern locality at which it has been taken is Beaufort on the central portion of the coast of North Carolina and the vicinity of Wilmington on the southern coast of that State.
A specimen before us from Brazos County Texas constitutes the most western record at the present date.
The species is found on the Bermudas and is probably widely iistributed through the greater and lesser Antilles having been taken in the Bahamas Cuba and St. Vincent.
Biological Notes.
 The present species is bushloving and over the greater portion of its range is rather plentiful in bayberry and other heavy bushes.
On the Florida Keys specimens could almost invariably be found in Ilex cassine during the proper season.
At Wrightsville North Carolina not only was it found in great numbers in the bayberry bushes but also on the ground among leaves and low plants under live oaks in countless numbers.
Hardly ever before had the species been found on the ground.
In this respect the present species differs from both known species of Cycloptilum which are almost Wholly terrestrial and it may be said to be truly thamnophilous.
Synomjmy.
 The description and figures of ant Mar um perfectly match the series of specimens before us and we unhesitatingly refer our specimens to Redtenbacher's species.
Saussure's Liphoplus krugii from Cuba also agrees perfectly and specimens before us from Cuba which we have previously determined as krugii are inseparable from others in the present series.
The name consequently falls into the synonymy under antillarum.
Scudder has described Mogosiplistus slossoni from Biscayne Bay Florida apparently without reference to the literature bearing on the Mogoplistii of the Antilles and after examination of his type we unhesitatingly place it also in the synonymy under antillarum.
We have examined the unique female type of Mogisoplistus harbouri Morse in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge and find it to be a very large specimen of the present species ten millimeters in length.
The tympanum on the cephalic face of the cephalic femora in antillarum is found to vary in a large series from elliptical to nearly circular and the fact that the species in southern Florida is particularly small doubtless caused the large Bahaman specimen to appear different from the small individuals of the type series of Scudder's synonymic Mogosiplistus slossoni when it was compared with those specimens and described as new.
Remarks.
 The female of this species in the later stages of the nymphal condition has six heavy dentiform spines on each side of the heavy ovipositor sheath these are situated distad along the ventral margin of the upper sections of the valves.

.This species is quite different from C. antillarum to which of the known species of this genus it is most nearly related.
Its form is quite distinctive owing to its somewhat tubular appearance caused by the fact that in this species alone of the six known to belong to the genus Cryptoptilum the head pronotum and abdomen are of very 29 Throughout the present paper it is understood that specimens taken by the authors are in the Hebard Collection and The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

nearly the same width throughout.
The insect is very much the same size as antillarum but the dorsal surface of the head is more flattened while the interantennal protuberance is more sharply rectangulate.
As in C. trigonipalpum the tympanum on the cephalic face of the cephalic tibia is circular not oval as is usual in C. antillarum.
The last three segments of the maxillary palpi are much as in antillarum but are more robust in proportion to their length.
The pronotum is proportionally longer and its sides are subparallel.
The caudal femora are much the same as in antillarum and the armament of the limbs is similar.

This insect shows the closest relationship to C. trigonipalpum vide infra from which species it differs in the somewhat heavier build which however is not as heavy as in C. antiUarum.
The pronotum is proportionately more expansive both in length and width in the male and in fact considerably exceeds the broader species antiUarum.
The caudal femora are more strongly inflated and in this respect closely resemble antiUarum.
In the female the pronotum is wider being in proportionate width intermediate between trigonipalpum and antiUarum the subgenital plate differs from all other species of the genus in being apically keeled and the ovipositor is also very much shorter than in any of the other forms.

Color Notes.
 There is scarcely any difference in ground coloration between antillarum and the present species except that in the series of the latter species before us the maxillary palpi are never darkly suffused though of a richer brown than the surrounding facial parts and all have the dorsal surface of the abdomen wholly black.
The insects are thickly covered with nearly transparent scales so that in the field they frequently appear to have the black abdomen ringed above at the intersection of the segments with whitish scales due to the fact that at the juncture of the segments the scales are somewhat raised and the refraction of light gives them a whitish appearance where such refraction occurs.
Distribution.
 This species is now known to occur in the Bahama Islands and the southeastern United States.
The series shows the range of the species to extend from eastcentral North Carolina to the northern Florida Keys and New Providence Island Bahamas.
Biological Notes.
 This species was not always recognized in the field as different from antillarum although on one or two occasions the notes refer to it as a different species.
From our notes we are therefore only able to state that the species occurs often in the same general region with antillarum but it is probable that it seeks rather heavier growth than that species as the fallowing field note would suggest.
The Jungle Liphoplus 3 has scales only oh under side and around segments of abdomen giving it a ringed appearance and a strikingly red and black color when compared with Liphoplus krugii which species is covered with sparse silvery scales pronotum and all.

Color Notes.
 Over the more arid portions of the range of this species which includes the type locality the general color of the insects is rather pale brown the entire body more or less covered 37 For variability of this character see note in 'Remarks.'
38 Appears to have been somewhat squeezed out.
with silvery or yellowish scales while a postocular bar of darker scales frequently extends as a narrow line of dark scales along the dorsal edge of the lateral lobes of the pronotum to its caudal margin.
In specimens which have lost their scaly covering no trace of such a line exists the ground color of head pronotum limbs and first two or three segments of the abdomen is found to be russet while the remainder of the abdomen is black.
The maxillary palpi are much suffused with blackish this is most pronounced in the darkest specimens.
The ovipositor is vandykebrown.
Specimens from Nebraska show in individuals which have lost their scaly covering the same coloration but when fully clothed with scales their appearance is rather more yellowish owing to the fact that in these individuals a greater proportion of their scales are more yellowish than in specimens from the arid West.
Individuals from the Atlantic coast are similar to western specimens in body coloration but their scale covering is usually composed chiefly of blackish or slatecolored scales which gives the specimens a dark and somewhat mottled appearance quite different from that of western representatives of the species.
This difference in coloration is augmented by the fact that while in western individuals the caudal margin of the tegmina is marked with a few faintly darker veins the Atlantic coast representatives of the species have this margin heavily and strikingly velvety black.
Distribution.
 This species is now known to range from central New Jersey southward on the Atlantic coast to northcentral Florida westward across Texas and southern Arizona as far as the Mojave Desert in California in the middle west north to the northern boundary of Colorado and over the entire central and northeastern portions of Nebraska.
This distribution is rather surprising owing to the fact that the species is to be found both in the humid regions of the East and the areas of extreme aridity of the Southwest.
The vertical range of the species is known to extend from sea level to an elevation of 3550 feet on the Great Plains 2274 feet in the Mojave Desert and 2500 feet in Pima County Arizona.
Biological Notes.
 At Cottonwood California 39 this species was common under creosote bush Covillea where among the collected refuse at the base of the bushes the insects were heard shrilly stridulating at dusk and later.
The sound produced was an incessant and Proc.

Phila. 1909 p. 482. highpitched zeeezeeezeee.
Along the Atlantic coast the authors have found the species under boards and various other debris on the ground usually along the edge of or in forest growth and almost always in very small numbers.
Once however a locality was examined where the little insects were present in countless numbers this was on St. Simon's Island Georgia where myriads were found jumping about among the dead leaves and very few low plants and grasses growing on the sandy soil under live oaks.
Professor Bruner has stated that the synonymous C. borealis is common in Nebraska among dry grass and under boards on sandy soil.
Synonymy.
 As we have before us one male and fifteen females of the typical series of Cycloptilus borealis Bruner we are enabled to refer it unhesitatingly to the present species.
There are no differences between these specimens and the type and allotype of squamosum except in the coloration of the scaly covering which in the present species is exceedingly variable.
We find Scudder's measurements to be accurate while those given by Bruner in the original description of borealis are quite different from what we find to be the case in the typical series which in size and proportions can in no way be separated from squamosum.
Remarks.
 In the series of females before us the distal section of the margin of the subgenital plate varies from a type which is arcuatoconvergent laterad with the distal section of the margin complete to one which has the distal section of the margin broadly emarginate this emargination flanked laterad by acute spiniform angles.
The majority of specimens from the Atlantic coast have this emargination present while it is absent in the majority of western specimens but an examination of the series shows that it is not constant and that in this species the entire form of the subgenital plate is exceedingly variable in the female sex while in the male it is simple and broadly arcuate.

At the time of the original description the authors were not acquainted with the Scudderian genus Cycloptilum and Saussure's misconception led us to suppose that the present species did not belong to that genus.
We are now able to state definitely the following facts 40 These specimens were unfortunately recorded as Liphoplus krugii by the authors.
These Proceedings 1907 p. 316.
41 One of these two specimens is the unique type of Cycloptilum squamosum Scudder.

215 The present species is distinguished from Cycloptilum squamosum by its smaller size relatively more regularly convex dorsal surface of the pronotum in the male which is less expanded caudad and is much shorter.
In the female the pronotum is very small and narrows somewhat more cephalad.
Proprtionately the limbs are shorter and the caudal femora more flealike.
Differences in coloration are also apparent and are given in the color description below.

 The entire territory over which this species is known has much of its surface composed of rough coquina rock which rock is very white.
The species is wholly terrestrial and we find that its scaly covering is silvery usually with limbs barred and body spotted and mottled with dark brown scales this coloration so matches the surface of the coquina rock that the little insects are practically invisible when at rest.
The insect is very much whiter in appearance than its larger relative C. squamosum even where specimens of that species from the arid West are found covered with pale yellowish scales.
The postocular bar is very dark in this species and in the entire series before us extends along the upper edge of the lateral 43 Specimen much squeezed out normal length probably about 5 mm.

Rubbed specimens show that the ground color of the species on head pronotum mesonotum metanotum and all of the limbs is very pale yellowish while the abdomen is black and the ovipositor dark brown.
Unlike in squamosum the postocular bar mentioned above is present not only in scale coloration but ground coloration as well while the lateral lobes of the pronotum are somewhat lighter in coloration than its dorsal surface.
The maxillary palpi are usually light the apical joint suffused with blackish distad this darker suffusion in a few cases overspreading the last three joints.
The tegmina are bone white the caudal border lightly blotched with black.
Distribution.
 Lake Worth southward to Key West Florida.
Biological Notes.
 Nearly all of the specimens of this terrestrial species have been captured hiding on the under surface of coquina boulders near or on the strand  the type however was captured in the low undergrowth growing on rough coquina rock in the scattering pine woods back of Miami.
The little insects have never been found more than two or three at a time and usually a considerable area has to be carefully searched before any specimens are discovered.
When first exposed they usually remain motionless and closely pressed to the surface of the rock under which they had been hiding when disturbed however they spring about wildly and are so hard to follow with the eye that unless captured before they are thoroughly aroused individuals have excellent chances of escaping.
Remarks.
 This species is unquestionably closely related to Cycloptilum squamosum and it is possible that it may prove to be a geographic race of that species limited to southern Florida.
Without material from the region between Palm Beach and Jacksonville however we are unable to find the slightest suggestion of intergradation.
The facts that the characters which separate zebra from squamosum are constant and that the former species is invariably much the smaller rather suggest that zebra is not a race at all since over the tremendous range of squamosum no such differences are to be found in that species.
In the entire series of females the subgenital plate is without exception arcuatoconvergent laterad with the distal section of the margin flattened but with no trace of the emargination and acute spiniform angles found in so many females of squamosum from the Atlantic coast.

This genus known from a single female is widely separated from all others of the group.
In some respects a relationship or development along similar lines to Glaphyropus is apparent this is shown in he compact build rounded head small eyes broadly rounded and but little produced interantennal space which is not divided by a vertical sulcus and similar caudal femora.
With these characters however similarity to Glaphyropus ceases and we find instead a close relationship to Cycloptilum in the following respects maxillary palpi very much like those found in Cycloptilum cephalic and median limbs also similar very different from the elongate type found in Glaphyropus ovipositor of the type of Cycloptilum but somewhat arcuatoconvex and differing from all other known North American members of the group in having the ventral margins of the apex armed distad with a row of minute but true serrulations  cerci of the type found in Cycloptilum caudal tarsi even shorter and proportionally heavier  armament of limbs of the same type as found in Cycloptilum but reduced in size to an extreme degree the metatarsi are proportionally very long nearly intermediate between Glaphyropus and Cycloptilum but more closely approaching the former the dorsal margins armed with serrulations similar to those of Cycloptilum but so fine that they apparent only in a good light under a microscope.
Consequently we see that the caudal limbs are most peculiar in having proportions and armament differing strikingly from any other known species the caudal femora are elongate and not at all flealike the tarsi are very short quite heavy and armed with minute distal spurs while the metatarsi are proportionally very long and slender their dorsal margins so finely serrate that these could almost be termed unarmed and their terminal spurs minute.

When compared with Mogoplistes the following differences are found.
Head very different ovoid interantennal protuberance not as produced and with no vertical sulcus eyes not so protuberant pronotum with dorsal surface more flattened caudal femora shorter caudal tarsi very much shorter proportionally very much longer caudal metatarsi armament of limbs different as in Cycloptilum but all of the spurs and serrulations much smaller.
The ovipositor in Mogoplistes is straight rather long with lateral division of valves exactly at middle proximad but rising sharply and much nearer the dorsal margin over the greater length of the ovipositor the apex is not widened and is armed on the ventral edge of the dorsal valves with blunt knoblike serrations while the surface of the dorsal valves is finely punctate.
In Oligacanthopus the ovipositor is very different from this as may be seen by reference to the description.

Color Notes.
 So heavily covered with scales is the only specimen known that it is difficult to state the ground coloration of the insect.
This coloration appears to be very pale woodbrown over the entire surface of the body the interantennal protuberance never has the distal portion scaled and in the present species this is strikingly marked with four parallel vertical bars of bistre separated by bars of the ground color of the same width these somewhat more tinged with yellowish.
The terminal joints of the maxillary palpi have also a broad band of bistre encircling their median portion while the tip is more yellowish than the basal portion of the palpi which is of the prevailing very pale woodbrown.
The antennae are colored as the tips of the maxillary palpi but have the third sixth tenth and sixteenth joints on each side bistre.
The scaly covering is composed of silvery scales among which darker ones are found in confused masses the tarsi all are distinctly twice banded with these scales and in addition the base of the caudal tarsis is so darkened.
The general effect is that of an irregularly mottled silvery hairbrown insect with banded limbs.
Biological Notes.
 Although but a single specimen of this species has been captured others were seen.
All of these were observed at Miami Florida in the heavy semitropical hammock on the south bank of the Miami River and were found by prying up loose pieces of bark and tearing off signs on the low oak trees.
When exposed the insects sprang wildly about to which habit is due the fact that but a single specimen was taken.
Distribution.
 Miami Dade County Florida.
Synonymy.
 When the specimen on which this species is based was first recorded the authors confused it with Scudder's Mogosiplistus slossoni Cryptoptilum antillarum partially owing to the fact that Saussure had stated that the interantennal protuberance of Mogoplistes Mogisoplistus Saussure 1877 not Mogosiplistus Scudder 1897 was not divided by a median vertical sulcus.
Specimens from Saussure before us of the type of that genus Mogoplistes brunneus prove that though the interantennal protuberance is not absolutely divided by a sulcus still it shows a distinct though minute sulcation quite as strongly as Cryptoptilum antillarum.
This sulcation appears to be found in nearly all the species of the present group and although in Glaphyropus and Oligacanthopus this may be said to be absent under a powerful microscope traces of such a suture may be found.
Liphoplus and Arachnocephalus are said to have the protuberance so distinctly sulcate that when viewed from above the interantennal protuberance can be seen to be divided by a sulcus which separates this part into two distinct lobes.
In all of the other known genera a distinct but more or less subobsolete sulcus exists.
The variation in individual opinion in considering this type sulcate or nonsulcate has led to much confusion.

Sci. IX p. 58.
Genus includes three species.
Genotype  Hoplosphyrum occidentale Mogoplistes occidentalis Scudder.
.The genus Hoplosphyrum is erected to include forms which are closer to Ornebius Guerin than to any other genus but from which individuals of this genus can be readily separated by the elongate median spur of the caudal tibiae and the very peculiar nondilated apex of the ovipositor.
The form of the pronotum and the apparent tegmina of the males show that they are not at all related to true Ectatoderus while the presence of welldeveloped tegmina in the male the ovipositor structure in the female and the spur proportions are readily appreciable characters to differentiate the new genus from Mogoplistes.
Generic Description.
 Form hardly depressed compact surface clothed with scales pronotum little produced caudad in male in general subquadrate dorsad  tegmina absent in female welldeveloped and projecting caudad of pronotum in male.
Head little produced cephalad interantennal protuberance with slightest trace of vertical division.
Pronotum of male subdepressed 7 From '''..mi  arm or weapon and cyvpov ankle in allusion to the long spurs on the distal extremities of the caudal tibiae.
subquadrate or slightly longer than wide narrowing but little cephalad cephalic margin areuatoemarginate caudal margin arcuatotruncate of female transversely arcuate subquadrate in form cephalic margin areuatoemarginate caudal margin emarginatotruncate disk in both sexes cephalad with paired pyriform impressed outlines flanked cephalad and caudad by single subcallous points.
Tegmina of male extending caudad of pronotum a distance equal or subequal to the pronotal length broad distal margin arcuate tympanum fully developed lateral field deep.
Ovipositor cylindrical straight or but little arcuate apex simple not differentiated from the shaft unarmed immediate apex acute.
Subgenital plate of both sexes with the distal margin not excised this plate in females compressed.
Cerci of both sexes elongate tapering.
Cephalic tibiae with the cephalic face with a distinct tympanum.
Caudal femora dilated caudal tibiae straight robust deplanate dorsad serrate dorsolaterad with three pair of distal spurs the dorsointernal shorter than the ventrointernal the mediointernal elongate reaching to the middle of the metatarsus caudal metatarsus compressed sulcate dorsad strongly serrate on both dorsal margins armed distolaterad with spurs which cover the proximal portion of the terminal joint of the tarsus.

Distribution.
 With all the known material of this species before us we can only give its distribution as the Cape Region of Lower California.
San Jose del Cabo and Cape St. Lucas are the localities.
Synonymy.
 Originally described and for years known only from two typical females the acquisition of males of the allied boreah enabled Scudder to remove the species from Mogoplistes in which he had erroneously placed it at the time of the original description.
Unfortunately he placed it in Ectatoderus Guerin a genus which has no apparent tegmina in the male and an immensely long pronotum in the same sex.
In consequence we have been compelled to erect the genus Hoplosphyrum to receive the three forms here placed in it.

 This specimen differs from the allotypic male of occidentale in the characters here given.
Size smaller head subcompressed the depth considerably greater than the greatest width across eyes eyes less protuberant hardly projecting beyond the general line of the head.
Pronotum with the cephalic width contained slightly more than once in the length of the dorsum lateral margins moderately expanding caudad caudal margin of the disk less rounded laterad than in occidentale and in consequence the caudal margin is straighter  lateral lobes of the pronotum deeper than in occidentale ventrocaudal margin without any arcuateemargination more decidedly oblique truncate.
Tegmina on account of the reduced pronotum appearing to be longer and more ample than in occidentale in general form and proportions however being very similar the greatest width of a single tegmen is slightly less than the caudal width of the pronotum speculum of tegmina distinctly wider than the cephalic width of the pronotum and subequal to the median length of the same.
Caudal femora less inflated than in occidentale caudal metatarsus armed dorsad with eight internal and ten external spines.

 General tone of more or less abraded specimens varying from cinnamon to ochraceous the abdomen generally sealbrown but in a few specimens 51 the abdominal coloration is no darker than the general tone.
Eyes varying from broccoli to clovebrown  palpi varying in similar fashion.
Lateral lobes of the pronotum wholly sealbrown the dorsal line of the color mass more sharply defined in some than in other specimens.
Abdominal segments in the majority of specimens narrowly margined with whitish ovipositor ferruginous cerci buffy darkening distad.
Limbs buffy 52 but as the overlying scales are more generally present on the limbs than on the rest of the body and in color are raw umber the general shade is dark with however a more or less distinct paler pregenicular annulus caudal tibiae with the scales colored in such a fashion that there is a broad median pale annulus and another extremely narrow one immediately distad of the genicular extremity the remainder of the tibial scales being sealbrown.
In the specimens sufficiently abraded on the dorsum to enable one to ascertain the color of the scales it is seen that pale buffgray is the covering color while in some specimens regularly placed patches of umber scales are found on the margins of the abdominal segments.
Distribution.
 From Southern New Mexico Alamogordo and Organ Mountains west to Southern California north as far as the southern slopes of the Sierra Madre Claremont thence south to the Cape region of Lower California.
Nothing whatever is known of the distribution of the species in northern Mexico and we have no record of its occurrence in Arizona.
The highest elevation of which we have record at which the species has been taken is Dripping Springs N. M. at an altitude of 5800 feet above sea level.
Biological Notes.
 The only knowledge concerning the habits of this species is the fact that the Alamogordo specimen was taken by the authors from a dead yucca.
Remarks.
 The present species is one which varies much in size New Mexican individuals surpassing all others in this respect except Sierra Laguna Lower California specimens.
Such variation is not 51 These specimens have not had their coloration lightened by alcoholic immersion.
A number of other individuals which have at some time been immersed in alcohol are equally pale on the abdomen but we have not considered such specimens in drawing up the above notes.
62 In specimens which have been in alcohol the cephalic and median limbs are much darker sealbrown in fact but this does not seem to be the natural coloration.
correlated with definite regions as San Jose del Cabo representatives are as small as any seen while the Los Angeles County California specimens are all of very small size.
The Lower California individuals vary considerably from the typical New Mexican phase approaching occidentale in the shape of the head some specimens having the proportions of the latter as in occidentale but in such cases the proportion of the pronotum in the male the rather slenderer caudal femora in both sexes and the distinctly shorter and more robust ovipositor in the female will serve to associate properly the individuals.
The number of spines on the dorsal margins of the caudal metatarsi varies considerably the external margin having from six to nine and the internal seven to twelve distinctly indicated.
The number of these spines is in no way correlated with the locality.
The tympanum is clearly indicated on the cephalic face of the caudal tibiae in all the adults examined although varying considerably in size and exact shape but it is not present in nymphal specimens.
The cerci vary in length in this species much as in Cryptoptilum antiUantm.
The subgenital plate in the male is weakly subtruncate in several individuals but its normal form is similar to that of occidentale.

Genus LIPHOPLUS Saussure.

Liphoplus Saussure Melang.
Orth. II pp.
456 483.
Genotype selected by Kirby  Liphoplus novarce Saussure.
We do not feel positive that the following species is really a member of the genus Liphoplus which elsewhere is found only in the Polynesian Indian and Malagasian regions.
However as the original description specifically agrees with most of the generic characters which Saussure gave as diagnostic of his genus we have no alternative in the absence of material but to retain it in Liphoplus.
No mention is made of the absence of a tympanum on the cephalic face of the cephalic tibiae which absence is considered an important generic character in the original description of the genus but this omission is rather discounted by the figure which shows no tympanum thus agreeing with true Liphoplus.
The interantennal protuberance is described and figured as distinctly divided.
Generic Description.
 Body pubescent the females apterous the males supplied with tegmina.
Head as in Arachnocephalus showing a protuberance divided by a sulcus.
Pronotum in the males produced posteriorly over the metanotum as in Ectatoderus the caudal margin arcuate less produced in the females.
Anterior tibiae having the internal faces supplied with a small tambourine.
Tegmina of males short membranous supplied with a complete tambourine but sometimes more or less obsolete.
This genus is to us but imperfectly known.
The body is very pubescent but we presume that it should be likewise more or less scaled in fresh and wellpreserved individuals.
The elytra of the males show in their tambourines certain analogies to those of the Phalangopsini the first vein being angulate.
Liphoplus differs from Arachnocephalus in the anterior tibiae being furnished with a tambourine and in their winged males from Ectatoderus in their facial protuberance being distinctly divided.
