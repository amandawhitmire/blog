NEW LAND MOLLUSKS OF THE JAPANESE EMPIRE.
BY H. A PILSBRY AND Y. HIRASE.
A number of new forms chiefly collected by Mr. Nakacla in Kyushu and the Ryukyu chain last winter are herein described.
In working up these islands many hardships and dangers were encountered not the least being the abundance of venomous snakes locally called Hahu.
The malacological results have been most gratifying as we now have a fair knowledge of the snails of all the larger islands and many of the smaller ones.
Mr. Nakada has now been sent to China.
OYCLOPHORIDJE.
Cyclophorus turgidus miyakoensis n. subsp.
This form differs from C. turgidus by its wider umbilicus smaller aperture slightly expanded and obtuse but not thickened lip which is white.
It differs from C. kikaiensis by the nonduplicate peristome and large size.
It is related also to C. elegans Mlldff. from the Marble Rocks Kuangtung China.
The coloration varies from yellowishwhite with numerous spiral lines and bands of brown spots to dark chestnut brown with interrupted irregular whitish bands on the base and whitish flames below the suture.

Siplommatina tokunoshimana errans n. subsp.
Shell similar to D. tokunoshimana except that the whorls of the conical portion of the spire and the back of the penultimate whorl are sculptmed with widely spaced threads.
On the front of the penultimate and on the last whorl the threadstrise are much closer though neither so close or so fine as in tokunoshimana.
Tamina Kunchan Ryukyu.

Phila. from No.
1349 of Mr. Hirase's collection.
In D. tokunoshimana and D. t. errans the spout or sinus at the foot of the columella is developed more strongly than in D. paxillus Gredler of China  the columella is straighter and the mouth is more irregular in shape not approaching circular as in paxillus the columellar margin being vertical and straight.
The Formosan D. hungerfordiana has a much shorter cone than tokunoshimana.
Diplommatina tosana kureana n. subsp.
Differs from D. tosana by the longer straightly conic upper half of the shell which tapers regularly from the penultimate whorl while in D. tosana the next earlier whorl is larger and the spire convexly conic.
There is also nearly a whorl more almost 7 in kureana and the columellar margin of the aperture is more straightened.
The constriction is above or barely behind the outer lip as in tosana the palatal plica is long covered by the parietal callus and the columellar lamella strong and horizontal.

T. pfeifferi Marts. described from Japanwithout more exact locality is larger and more robust 6x3 mm and is sculptured with nearly straight riblets equal to their intervals and evanescent on the last whorl.
It has not been figured and was collected by Siebold Mr. Hirase has found no Truncatella agreeing with the characters quoted.

In K. crenulata the base is smooth and that species has not been found in Kyushu or southward up to this time.
ENDODONTID.
Punctum boreale n. sp.
Shell depressed umbilicate dark brown thin dull whorls 3 the first li smooth the rest with oblique coarse widely irregularly spaced wrinklelike ribs the intervals and ribs finely striate spirally.
Whorls convex the last rounded peripherally and below.
Umbilicus somewhat smaller than the aperture.
Aperture olDlique rounded about onefourth of the circle excised at the parietal margin.

This species differs from P. amblygona Reinh.
by its rounded periphery.
It is also related to the southern P. rota.
PUPILLID.
Vertigo Mrasei kushiroensis n. subsp.
Differs from V. hirasei Pils.
by being larger more solid brown with a strong pale ridge or crest a short distance behind the outer lip.
It is not as wide and swollen as V. h. hachijoensis.
The typical four teeth are developed.
Length 1.8 diam.

Vertigo hirasei in some of its varieties will probably be found throughout Japan since the type came from Kyushu while the form described above is from northern Yesso and another subspecies occurs in the islands of Izu.
ACHATINELLID.
Tornatellina rucuana n. sp.
Shell imperforate ovateconic thin pale brown lightl striatulate glossy.
Spire conic whorls 4 convex.
Aperture oblique ovate.
Outer lip thin and simple.

This is a wider shell than T. triplicata and the 3oung do not have internal varices or a triplicate columella.
It is the first imperforate Tornatellina found in the Ryukyu Islands.
AURICULID.
Cassidula labrella japonica n. subsp.
Shell imperforate oval wdth conic spire solid dark brown.
The whorls of the spire have a groove defining a rather wide subsutural border and rarely several weak spirals below it.
The last whorl is very finely striate spirally the most strongly sculptured specimens with some deeper punctate strise among the others all the strioe being very weak or even obsolete.
Whorls 7 to 8 nearly flat.
Some inconspicuous slightly paler variceal streaks are visible on the spire.
The last whorl has a narrow and often very low crest close behind the outer lip and the usual keel or cord at the base defining a small umbilical area.
Aperture including peristome seventwelfths the length of the shell regularly ovate slightly oblique.
Peristome nearly white outer lip with a strong internal callus excised above as usual and either evenedged or weakly twotoothed near the upper end.
Inner lip with three folds the lower two entering not emerging to the lipedge the upper parietal fold small and tubercular not longitudinal sometimes wanting.
Length 13 diam.

Length 12 diam.

C. labrella described from the Isle of France is a more strongly striate shell with larger aperture.
The present form is almost smooth the striae scarcely being discernible in most specimens.
C. plecotrematoides Mlldff.
is more strongly striate with the upper parietal tooth and the two on the lipcallus better developed.
I am disposed to consider both the Japanese form descriled above and the Chinese C. plecotrematoides as subspecies of C. labrella  but if the Chinese form be separated specifically then C. I. japonica will be referred to it as a subspecies.
Cassidula paludosa nigrobrunnea n. subsp.
Similar to C. paludosa Garrett but the parietal denticle is better developed than usual in that species the color is deep chocolate brown with a blackish line below the suture.

This little Cassidula has the egglike shape and high lipcrest of the Vitian C. paludosa of which the types are before me but that is so far as known invariably yellow or light brown in color.
