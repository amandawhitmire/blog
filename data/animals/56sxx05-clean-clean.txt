DESCRIPTIONS OF NORTH AMERICAN ARANEiE OF THE FAMILIES LYCOSID AND PISAURID. '
BY THOMAS H. MONTGOMERY JR. A very considerable number of species of spiders of the families Lycosidffi and Pisamida
have been described from North America but for the most the descriptions have barely diagnostic worth.
At the present time it is practically impossible to identify most of the species of Walckenaer Blackwall Hentz and some others because some of their species are so insufficiently described that a particular description applies equally well to a number of species.
By far the most thorough work so far is that of KeyserHng.
When the American species are better known than they are at present we shall be in better position to identify the species named by the earlier writers for then the identification can be done by the process of ehmination.
The more deeply one enters into the closely intergrading species of the Lycosidai especially the more doubtful seems to be the character of attempts to recognize poorly described forms.
Nearly the whole southeastern section of the United States and the greater part of the region west of the Mississippi river have been untouched by modern arachnologists with such a hiatus in the material for comparison it would be unscientific to make sure of the status of species known only by inadequate diagnoses.
It is right to attempt as far as possible to recognize the species of earlier writers but not to uphold names when the type specimens are lost and when the type descriptions are not decisive.
When all the species are known the trial can be undertaken of determining the earlier species.
The Lycosidffi and Pisauridffi are particularly interesting groups because of the difficulties in the way of their study.
Not only do the species intergrade closely but there is very considerable individual variation apart from geographical variation and the genera are as difficult to define sharply as are the species.
No groups are better adapted to prove the idea that the species as the higher groups are but concepts and their dehmitation necessary purely for purposes of deTtributions from the Zoological Laboratory of the University of Texas No.
.57. scription and interpretation.
What is needed above all as the preliminary to any morphological or Inroad ethological study of them are full and ample descriptions of the structure of the external genitalia together with the form and proportions of the cephalothorax the mouth parts and the legs.
The number of the teeth on the tarsal claws is of no value for it is subject to great individual variation as has been shown by ni student Mr. Carl Hartmann.
The number of teeth on the chelicera is of more importance but must be used cautiously and at the most as a specific character for I have found a specimen of TrocJiosa purcelli where one cheliceron differed in the number of its teeth from the other.
The number of spines on the joints of the legs may not be greatly subject to individual variation but in very closely related species it ma differ as e.g. the spines of the ventral surface of tibia I in Pardosa.
Characters of the relative position of the eyes are decidedly variable in different individuals of some species apparently constant in some others.
Again some species particularly of Trochosa and Pirata show consideralle secondary sexual structural differences.
And the epigyna even perhaps the best of any single structural character are often variable in their form.
In the present paper I give descriptions of the structure of all those species seen by me with figures of the genitalia in those cases where they have not been figured before or where the figures have been badly made and descriptions of the color and dimensions only in the case of new species or where preceding descriptions were not detailed.
Where such descriptions conflict with those of my previous papers thejare to be considered as emendations of the latter.
In the measurements of the legs the coxse are included and b the term height of the head in front is meant the distance from the inferior margin of the clypeus to the superior border of the eyes of the second row.
Onl writers who have given descriptions are included in the synonymical list of each species.
All the species previously described by me are described again but in their structure much more in detail than before also all the species described by Emerton 1885 except his Lycosa nigroventris and Pirata insularis are described  and in the Keys all the species from the continent of North America described by Kej'serling 1876 are included.
No species have been considered from the North American continent south of the United States.
With great care I have gone over again the previous descriptions of all the species from this region but unfortunately the following papers were inaccessible to me Banks 1894a Blackwall 1846 1871 Cragin Giebel 1869 Girard 1854 and Thorell 1872.
Doubtless on accoimt of these missing papers some mistakes will be found to have crept into the identification of certain species.
My thanks are due to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and to Mr. Witmer Stone in particular for the loan of all of their type specimens and especially to Mr. J. H. Emerton who not only loaned me a considerable number of specimens but also by correspondence aided me very materially in the question of the synonymy of certain species thus he pointed out the identity of his Pardosa hrunnea albomaculata and montana with species described by Thorell of my Lycosa ocreata pidchra with his Pardosa hilineata and of my Lycosa stonei with the Lycosa ocreata of Hentz.
In regard to the genera I have employed I must candidly admit that the delimitation of the genera was the most difficult part of the whole study.
Simon lS98a has withdrawn both Trochosa and Pirata into Lycosa wdiile I maintain their separateness and this because these two genera intergrade no more closely with Lycosa than does Pardosa so that if Pardosa is to be upheld the others must likewise be.
It is a question of either making one large comprehensive genus and for purposes of description subdividing it into a number of subgenera or of recognizing as many genera.
In either case the boundaries of the groups be they called subgenera or genera are equally difficult to define.
A new genus Geolycosa is proposed for forms which differ from Lycosa by the length and thickness of the first pair of legs.
Pardosa is composed of rapidly running usually or always diurnal species of small size with great length of legs and large ocular area and small chelicera they are essentially Lycosids which have become diurnal runners.
Geolycosa is the very opposite large forms with strong legs and jaws fitted for digging the deep cylindrical holes in which they live.
Some of the species of Pirata are peculiar in forming small closed nests in which they pass the winter little cups of silks attached to the under surface of stones.
They are generally found close to water.
The species of Trochosa are nocturnal living under stones where they apparently make no excavations.
Sosippus according to Simon builds a large websheeting.
Aulonia has the habits of Pirata and is closely related to it.
Lycosa is for the most part nocturnal and many of the species build shallow excavations lined with silk under stones others are in the breeding season at least diurnal such as scutulata and ocreata and these are forms which approach Pardosa in their structure.
So we find that the structure corresponds pretty closely to the habit long legs in the diurnal species high cephalic region in the running and digging species and low in the sedentary forms wliich do not form holes weak cheUcera and short lalium associated with slender legs large eye area is found in the diurnal species while small eye area is associated with tubicolous forms and species with very short legs.
So the genera here defined are based upon both morphological and ethological characters.
Finally this paper is by no means a comprehensive monograph but is intended to be a help to the one who comes later with sufficient material at his disposal to make the monograph.

Comparison.
 This species is most closely related to nigropalpis.
The c
of minima can be readily distinguished from that of nigropalpis in having the palpal patella entirely white instead of deep black in the different coloration of the legs and in the difference in size of the eye area.
But the females of the two are much more difficult to distinguish and there is no good structural difference in the structure of the epigyna.
In the  of 7ninima it is the usual case that the palpal patella has no dark spots below they are usually present in iiigropalpis  the sternum is brown never deep black with a yellow median lire anteriorly and a broader black one posteriorly and with some black on the margins in nigropalpis in the majority of specimens deep black with a yellow median line anteriorly  the femora below usually yellow 18 spotted with black in nigropalpis iisiialh' blackish  finally the cephalothoracal median yellow band usually encloses a broad rcddishbrowai area at its anterior end usually not so in nigropolpis .
Of all these differences the only one that appears to be constant is the first.
Minima averages smaller in size but then nigropalpis is very variable in this respect and nigropalpis has generally the dark annulations on the legs much more distinct but some individuals of minima from Wood's Hole Massachusetts have the legs just as distinctly banded.

Genus SOSIPPUS Simon 1888. '
The North American species of this genus described by Simon S. floridamis has not been seen by me.
The posterior spinnerets are longer than the anterior with the apical joint as long or almost as long as the basal and garnished with fusules on its inner siu'face the labium is longer than wide and quite onehalf the length of the maxillce  the posterior margin of the chelicera has 4 teeth.
The face is vertical only in the plane of the anterior eyes.
The legs are long the anterior tarsi and metatarsi usually scopulated.
metatarsus 1 as long as the patella and tibia combined.
First row of eyes broader than the second the lateral eyes as large or larger than the middle ones.
The integument is covered with plumed hairs.
The sides of the head are nearly vertical.
Evidently this genus is most closely allied to Pirata.

Genus LYCOSA Latreille 1804 ad partem.
I have followed Simon 1898 in defining this genus except that I have excluded from it Pirata and Trochosa.
The main characters are the following  The cephalothorax is highest in the cephalic portion except in the d of charonoides  and the sides of the head usually only moderately oblique the first eye row is shorter than the second except in inhonesta and in the cJ of charonoides  the eyes of the second row are never separated by more than 1.5 times their diameter the chelicera are robust and their length is usually quite twice the height of the head in front except in the Pardosoid species hilineata relucens and ocreata  the posterior spinnerets are shorter or but little longer than the anterior antelucana mccooki.
scutulata  tibia I has 3 pairs of ventral spines  the labium is shorter than onehalf the length of the maxillse but longer than wide except in hilineata and scutulata  metatarsus IV is shorter than the patella and tibia combined except in the c
of scutulata antelucana and ocreata.
The length of the dorsal eye area to the cephalothorax varies from 1  4.5 to 1  7.
The length of leg IV to the cephalothorax from 2.7  1 to 4.7  1.
The legs are usually well scopulated.
Lycosa intergrades very closely with Pardosa and the species hilineata relucens ocreata and scutulata are quite intermediate.
The relationship 'ith Trochosa is equally close.
More remote are the relations to Pirata yet P. elegans has a number of Lycosoid characters.

Montgomery 1903.
Under stones in the bed of Shoal Creek at Austin where they are very numerous two series of individuals may be distinguished  1 Smaller ones of lighter color.
Cephalothorax with the light submarginal band as distinct as the median.
Abdomen above with a pale brown to orange median band extending the whole length of the dorsum and enclosing in its anterior half a narrower darker band edged with black each side of the dorsum is darker with a row of whitish spots that are frequently connected by transverse white lines venter pale brown unspotted or with small spots.
Sternum and coxae darker brown to reddishbrown.
Legs greenish or yellowish with darker annulations.
Cephalothoracal length 9 7.58.5 mm.
2 Larger ones of darker color.
Cephalothorax with the submarginal bands frequently interrupted or indistinct.
Abdomen very dark above and with the pattern indistinct venter frequently blackish with numerous small black spots which are sometimes arranged in longitudinal rows rarely the entire venter is deep black.
Sternum and inferior surface of coxae reddishbrown to deep black.
Legs dark brown with more or less distinct darker annulations leg IV sometimes shows on the inferior surface deep black rings at both ends of the tibia and at the distal end of the tarsus.
Cephalothoracal length 
8.511.5 mm.
The intermediates between these two groups are not very numerous.
The most constant color diagnostic is the very narrow light median band of the cephalothorax.
This species is so variable that without a large series of individuals one might easily conclude that it included two species namely a smaller one nidicola of Emerton and a larger and darker one with distinct annulations on the legs inhonesta of Keyserling tigrina of McCook.
But there are no valid distinctions in the genitalia of the two and they intergrade in size and color so that I have conckided to regard them as one species.
It is possible that Emerton's vulpina is a color variety of this species but of vulpina I have seen only an adult male labelled so by Mr. Emerton and no adult female so that I could not decide the point.
Habits.
 This is a species of moist ground and meadow land and at Austin is very abundant under stones on the margin of Shoal Creek.
The males and the young are more or less diurnal the grown females nocturnal.

Remarks.
 The very considerable variation in the form of the epigynum led me originally to divide this into two species.
Recently I have obtained individuals with the epigynum quite intermediate in structure between the extremes first found.
The specimens from Texas are larger than the northern ones.
GEOLYCOSA nov. gen.
I propose this new genus for those species previously included in Lycosa in which the first leg is thickest and strongest furnished with thick scopulse on its three terminal joints and almost as long as the fourth shorter by not more than onehalf the length of tarsus I.
Geolycosa latifrons is the type species.
In Geolycosa latifrons the cephalothorax is very high in the cephalic portion and from that point to its posterior margin its dorsal contour is almost straight without any demarcation of a posterior declivity  the posterior declivity is only slightly marked in arenicola and carolinensis  but well marked in baltimoriana and texana.
In latijrons also the chelicera are very large and thick.
The first row of eyes is about as broad as the second except in texana.
The other characters are essentially those of Lycosa.
This genus is better demarcated from Lycosa than either Pardosa or Trochosa.
All the species dig deep cylindrical holes in the ground and some of them build a low turret of sticks around the aperture arenicola latifrons texana.
This burrowing habit has occasioned the thickness of the first pair of legs and occasioned also the height of the cephalothorax in front by the greater development of the muscles there.
Lycosa fatifera Hentz probably belongs to this genus but Hentz's very brief description Bluish lack cephalothorax deeper in color at the sides chelicera covered with rufous hairs and vnth.
a red elevation on their external side near the base one of the largest species is insufficient.
He states it is common in Massachusetts and this together with his description of its tube makes it possible that he had either a light variety of carolinensis or an unusually large and dark specimen of arenicola.

 Cephalothorax above grayishblack with a grayish median band that occupies the whole surface between the eyes of the second and third rows passes back to almost the middle of the cephalothorax there becomes narrower and continues to the posterior margin.
Extreme margin black.
There is an interrupted submarginal gray band which is continued on to the cephalic portion.
All the gray markings are due to long whitish hairs and finer whitish hairs are scattered over the blackish regions.
Sternum thickly covered with long stiff grayish hairs sometimes black on the margins.
Abdomen above on its anterior half with a median band of dark brownish edged narrowly with black and containing minute black spots  this band terminates truncated about the middle of the dorsum and on each side of it at about its middle is a pointed black spot.
This band hes in a less distinctly defined broader pale brownish band which extends the whole length of the dorsum and becomes much narrower toward the spinnerets.
In this broader band behind the narrower enclosed darker one are about 67 crescentic transverse markings each as wide as the broad band each black anteriorly and white posteriorly the most anterior being the most distinct at each end of each of these crescentic markings is a large pale gray spot.
Sides above dappled gray and blackish below with larger black spots scattered on a gray or yellow ground.
Venter in front of epigynum gray or yellow with a single pair of black spots.
Just behind the rima epigastrica is a broad transverse black band the anterior edge of which is straight and sharpl demarcated but the posterior edge of which is extended backward as a more or less interrupted median black band extending to a httle in front of the spinnerets and a pair of lateral black bands or rows of black spots Mhich curve backward to meet the median band just in front of the spinnerets  thus the venter appears to possess a pair of elongate yellow or yellowishgray areas separated by the median black band bordered laterally and posteriorly by the lateral black lines and anteriorly by the transverse black band.
Spinnerets blackish.
Chelicera anteriorly with orange and black hairs the macula red  maxillce reddishbrown labium darker.
Legs above grayish mth one or two black spots on the coxae and black longitudinal markings on the posterior aspect of the femora below each coxa is whitish sometimes with a longitudinal black stripe each femur whitish with a black ring at its distal end each patella whitish the first tibia blackish its entire length the tibiae of the other pairs whitish in the middle and black at the ends the tarsi and metatarsi black.
Palpi grayish unmarked except that the terminal joint is black on the inferior surface.
Comparisons.
 This large and beautiful species is quite distinct from any other.
It is very abundant in open areas of the limestone region of Austin and lives in deep cyhndrical holes lined with silk and with the opening of the tube raised above the surface of the ground as in G. arenicola.

Genus TROCHOSA C. Koch 1848.
This genus is most closely allied to Lycosa and differs from it mainly in the following characters  The first row of eyes is fully as wide as the second or at least as in avara and contestata the middle points of the lateral eyes of the first row are as far lateral as the middle points of the eyes of the second row the sides of the head are obliquely arched and the cephalothorax highest at or behind the middle except in the 9 of frondicola  the legs are usually comparatively short only in cinerea has leg IV a length of four times the cephalothorax and their spines are usually short in rubicunda there is only one ventral spine on tibia I.
The posterior spinnerets are never longer usually shorter than the anterior.
Metatarsus IV is always shorter than the patella and tibia combined.
The chelicera are robust and arched anteriorly with 3 teeth on their posterior margins 4 in contestata and their length is fully twice the height of the head in front.
The length of the dorsal eye area to the cephalothorax varies from 1  4.5 cinerea to 1  9 rubicunda.
The labium is longer than wide and frequently onehalf or more the length of the maxillse septdchrcdis frondicola furcelli cinerea.
There is a greater structural difference between Trochosa rubicunda and Lycosa scutulata than between the latter and Pardosa so that if we maintain the genus Pardosa we must also retain Trochosa.

Tibia I has 3 ventral pairs of spines.
The length of leg TV to the cephalothorax varies from 3.3  1 to 4.6  1  the legs have generally long spines and frecuently fine long hairs.
It is somewhat doubtful whether this genus is a homogeneous one marxi approaches Trochosa and elegans Lycosa.
There are also some resemblances to Aidonia.
All the species of Pirata known to me live beneath stones close to water and spin for themselves during the cold season little closed nests.

 The abdominal dorsum in all the specimens shows anteriorly a more or less distinct median yellow line ending in a point in front of the middle and generally less distinctly a short oblique yellow line at each side of its anterior end on the posterior half are 3 pairs of small white spots connected transversely by as many black lines which are not of the shape of a W but slightly curved with the concavity directed caudad each of these white spots is surrounded by black and only the 3 pairs on the posterior half of the dorsum are always distinct but anterior to them are 13 pairs which are usually very indistinct represented usually by small obscure black spots without white centers.
Characters of the c.
 An adult dried specimen of one of the original males described byEmerton as the male of tenebrosuswsiS kindly loaned to me by Mr. Emerton.
The eyes are as in the   the first row almost straight.
The legs are in order I II IV III.
Femur IV has on its posterior border near the distal end a prominent bunch of long thickened hairs or short spines which are much more prominent than in the female.
The palpal tibia has on its outer surface a long curved tooth and is on its ventrodistal border prolonged into a long toothed process  the palpus is longer than the cephalothorax.
This being a dried specimen it is difficult to compare it with the alcoholic specimens of the females  but the color of the legs is the same and also the general abdominal pattern the 3 pairs of white spots are very distinct and also the slightly curved transversed blackish lines connecting them the cephalothorax has a broad submarginal white band on each side continued also across the forehead.
Comparisons.
 There is no doubt that this is the urinator of Hentz  it possesses the pairs of small white spots on each posterior abdominal dorsum and the slightly curved black lines not of the shape of a W connecting them all shown distinctly in Hentz's figure.
It is closely related to fontanus and the epigyna of the two are very similar but in urinator it is always much broader than long and its median piece has a transverse groove just behind the middle while in fontanus it is nearly as long as broad and is without such a groove.
There are a number of constant differences expressed in the key which will serve to separate the species.
The females of idoneus may be easily distinguished from those of both urinator and jonianus by the entirely different structure of the epigynum and by leg IV being longer than I by less than onethird the length of the terminal joint.

Comparisons.
 Of all of Hentz's species this most nearly approaches his tenebrosus.
But as I wrote before 1902 Hentz's description is entirely insufficient as a diagnosis further he placed tenebrosus under the 'Henebrosse with the eyes subequal lower row as much curved as the upper which is not the case in idoneus and his figme of the mouth parts shows them entirely different from the condition in idoneus.
It is high time that tenebrosus which has occasioned so much dispute should be allowed to fall into the synonymy on account of being insufficiently characterized.

Introduction.
The study of the cleavage and early larval history of Fiona marina Forsk.
 embodied in this paper was undertaken with the view of ' Contribution from the Zoological Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania. '
Dr. H. A. Pilsbry of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has kindlv assisted me in identification.
obtaining as far as possible an exact knowledge of the development of this Opisthobranch in order that certain doubtful points regarding the embryology of Mollusks in general and this group in particular might be better understood.
Fiona has proved in many ways a difficult object for study but in certain respects offers advantages to the investigator.
The exact origin of the germ layers as they arise in the segmenting egg has been particularly sought throughout the cleavage history while in later stages attention has been directed to the rise of larval organs from their particular protoblasts where these could be definitely determined.
Where this has been found impossible approximate results are given.
Certain questions have presented themselves both at the beginning and during the progress of this work some of which may here be indicated briefly.
Though it has not been my purpose to consider particularly the mechanics of cleavage this phase of development has been borne in mind and in certain instances discussed.
Comparisons are made between the nearl equal cleavage of Fiona and the more unequal segmentation of many other molluscan and annelidan eggs.
The manner of origin of the germ layers is naturally a point of cardinal interest to the celllineage worker since by this method of investigation the most exact results are possible and very definite comparisons s'ith other forms may be made.
The exact derivation of the middle germ layer has been sought particularly.
Has it a single or double mode of origin
If both primary and secondary mesoderm be present which is larval and which forms permanent organs
How is the mesoderm segregated from the two primary germ layers
In the study of larval structure and development the excretory organs are of much interest since widely diverse views are held regarding the mode of origin and the significance of both primitive and definitive molluscan kidneys.
The axial relations between ovum and larva and the relations of the early cleavage planes to the median plane of the larva and adult are points of great interest.
How and when does bilaterality first appear
Wlien does tsion first become manifest and what is its immediate cause
These and other questions have arisen and have been borne in mind during the progress of the work.
Unfortunately material for the study of later larval stages and metamorphosis has not been obtainable so that a complete record of development from ovum to adult has been imiDOssible.
The work was begun in the early summer of 1901 at the Zoological Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania and continued together with general graduate study during the two following years at this University as well as throughout the two intervening summers at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory.
I am glad to acknowledge the many courtesies extended to me at both institutions.
I am particularly indebted to Prof. Conklin at whose suggestion the work was undertaken and it is a pleasure to express here my sincere appreciation of the valuable assistance which he has given me bj way of suggestion and kindly criticism.
Material and Methods.
For the material upon which this study has been made I am indebted to Drs.
E. G. Conklin and M. A. Bigelow by whom it was collected at Woods Hole Massachusetts during the summers of 1897 and 1898.
The Nudibranchs were found spawning upon floating gulfweed in Vineyard Sound taken to the Laboratory and kept in aquaria for some weeks where they spawned prolifically and where from day to day the eggs were collected and preserved.
Tliey were fixed in Kleinenberg's stronger picrosulphuric solution and Boveri's picroacetic for onehalf to threequarters of an hour and washed in 50 and 70 per cent alcohol as is the usual custom.
Living material upon which to study the breeding habits of the animals has not been accessible to me though search has been made in the same locality during the last two summers.
This lack of the living adult animals and embryonic stages has been a considerable drawback as it is particularly desirable that one investigating the developmental history of an organism should be able to observe its physiological activities and thereby verify conclusions gained through pureh' morphological work.
The material at hand has been amply sufficient for carrying the work up to the stage of the freeswimming veliger but not to the metamorphosis.
It is my hope that in the near future material for the study of later stages and of the metamorphosis into the adult may be obtained as many questions relative to the fate of larval organs must remain unanswered until this be accomplished.
Contrary to the conditions found among some other Nudibranchs the gelatinous mass surrounding the eggcapsules does not become greatly hardened upon fixing for upon being brought into water the jelly usually dissolves leaving the eggs free in their individual capsules.
The eggs may be sectioned without removing the jelly as it cuts without difficulty.
Both whole mounts and sections were stained in Delafield's hsematoxylin diluted with six to ten times its volume of distilled water and slightly acidulated by the addition of a trace of HCl or Kleinenberg's stronger solution after the method of ConkHn.
This stain gives a reddish tint which differentiates the nuclei with great distinctness.
Iron haematoxylin proved entirely unsatisfactory for sections of both early and late stages for even in the old veligers almost all the cells are found to contain small yolk spherules which take up the haematoxyhn so strongly and hold it so tenaciously that nuclei and cell walls are indistinguishable.
Eggs which have just been stained and mounted are not favorable objects for study but they should if possible stand for some time the longer the better until they gradually become more transparent by the penetration of balsam.
Indeed the most favorable slides are a few put up at the time the material was collected.
By the addition of a little cedar oil to the balsam or by moistening the edges of the cover with xylol at the time of using it is always possible to roll the eggs by moving the cover  a very necessary'process in celllineage work.
Most of the observation and drawing was done with the aid of a Leitz objective 7 ocular 4 a Zeiss camera being used with the paper at table level and plates reduced as indicated.
A  Leitz immersion was also used for observation when necsseary.

As a matter of convenience and for the sake of uniformity I have followed the system used by Conklin 1897 vith but slight variation.
A cleavage is obHque to the right when the upper daughter cell lies to the right of an imaginary observer whose body corresponds in position to the primary egg axis his head being at the animal pole and facing the cell considered vice versa a division oblique to the left is one in which the upper cell lies to the observer's left.
In the first instance the cleavage is dexiotropic in the second loeotropic Lillie 1895.
The term quartet is used to designate a generation of cells or their derivatives given off from the four cells meeting in the center of the vegetative pole regardless of their fate.
The different quartets are designated by coefficients placed before the letter indicating in wliich of the four quadrants the cells lie while the cell generations are marked by exponents which follow the letter.
The upper cell resulting from a cleavage is in all cases indicated by the smaller exponent thus 2b indicates the upper cell in B quadrant of the second quartet arising from the division of 2b while 2b is the lower.
When the spindle lies in a horizontal direction or in other words when the cleavage plane is meridional the cell which lies to the right is given the smaller exponent to the left the larger.
The capital letters A B C and D are reserved for the four cells which meet at the center of the vegetative pole ''macromeres and from which the  niicromeres  arise for these latter the small letters a b c and d are used.
Child 1900 and Treadwell 1901 have been followed in giving coefficients to the macromeres also to indicate their generation this being desirable when dealing with an egg in which after the first few cleavages the macromeres are large in name only Thus A B C and D form the fourcell stage.
At their next division from A arises lA and la from B IB and lb etc.
 lA then divides into 2A and 2a while la divides into la and la Treadwell.
Earlier Work on Opisthobranch Development.
A rather large number of older investigators have worked upon Nudibranch larval development.
Grant 1827 described the veligers of olis and Doris.
In 1837 Sars discovered that the young of Triionia Doris and olis possess a nautiloid shell  additional researches by the same investigator appeared in 1840 and 1845.
Loven 1839 described a number of Nudibranch larvae together with those of other mollusks.
Alder and Hancock's magnificent monograph upon the British Nudibranchs appeared in 1845 and contains a good general accovmt of the results thus far obtained upon the subject of Nudibranch embryology.
Reid in 1846 published an interesting paper upon the breeding habits of Doris Goniodoris Polycera Dendronotus Doto etC together with the constitution of the larvae.
An account of the embryology of Tcrgipes by Nordman appeared in the same year.
An extremely thorough account of the development of the Tectibranch Adceon by Vogt also appeared in 1846.
In 1848 Koren and Danielssen described the early stages of a number of Nudibranchs from the Norwegian coast.
Schneider 1858 described the veliger of Phyllorhoe.
Keferstein and Ehlers 1861 gave an accoimt of some of the developmental stages of jEoUs.
The later investigations of Langerhans 1873 Lankester 1875 Trinchese 188017 LacazeDuthiers and Pruot 1887 Rho 1888 Mazzarelh 189235 Heymons 1893 Viguier 1898 Carazzi 1900 Cluiart 1901 and other works upon Opisthobranch embryologj' together with those of importance pertaining to the remaining molluscan groups Annelids and Platodes will be considered during the course of this paper.
A good general account of spaM'uing habits of Nudibranchs is found in Alder and Hancock's Monograph of the British Nudibranchiate Mollusca 1845.
Maturation and Fertilization.
It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss in detail the maturation processes of the egg but a few words in that connection may not be amiss.
Maturation appears to have begun at the time of laying since the first polar spindle is already formed in all eggs examined.
In fig.
1 the chromosomes have moved to opposite ends of the first maturation spindle and at a slightly later period fig.
2 the sperm may be seen making its way through the yolk globules toward the upper pole.
In a large number of sections examined the sperm is seen to have entered at some point below the equator of the egg though apparently never directly at the center of the vegetative pole.
The chromatin of the sperm nucleus is but shghtly evident at this time but astral radiations are strongly marked in the surrounding cytoplasm.
The clear more protoplasmic substance of the egg becomes aggregated principally around the first polar spindle and in the neighborhood of the sperm nucleus though long strands of finely granular protoplasm extend through nearly the entire egg forming the astral rays.
The yolk which is in the form of rather small yolk globules encroaches closely upon these centers but is not as a rule found within them.
As the first polar body arises the upper surface of the egg becomes distinctly indented immediately above the first polar spindle and from this depression the first polar body emerges bearing with it the distal end of the first maturation spindle which rises as a whole toward the upper surface of the egg.
During this process the sperm nucleus and aster remain in relatively the same position as before.
There appears to be no telophase to this division but without entering into a rest stage the second polar body is given off.
This arises from the same place as the first pushing the latter farther outward or somewhat toward the side PI.
XXI fig.
3 Both finally lie in the slight depression at the surface of the egg.
The female nuclear elements still left within the egg then come to rest at first lying closely against the cell wall below the polar bodies.
The first polar body does not divide again immediately and may never do so though usually at a later period three are found.
If it remains undivided the first polar body exceeds the second in size.
With the close of maturation the sperm nucleus is seen to have moved upward through the yolk its chromatic elements have become more evident several large nucleoU being present.
The same is true of the female pronucleus.
They now approach each other and come to lie with their nuclear walls closely appressed fig.
4 the egg nucleus Uing above and the sperm which is the smaller below.
The clear granular protoplasm of the egg together with the sphere material surroimds both nuclei.
The upper surface of the egg has resumed its former rounded outline pushing the polar bodies farther outward.
Their connection with the egg does not appear to be a very intimate one for they do not in most cases maintain at a later period any fixed relation to the poles of the egg and so are of little value in orientation though they are often found in the apical region.
Unsegmented Egg.
The unsegmented egg of Fiona averages in diameter 80 micra with polar axis slightly less.
The two polar bodies lie at the animal pole.
Though the ovum is rather densely yolkladened the yolk globules are of such small size that in future cleavages they tend to become more equally distributed among the resulting blastomeres than is the case with eggs containing yolk in larger spheres.
The yolk which encroaches upon the more protoplasmic environs of the nucleus consists of smaller globules but otherwise its distribution throughout seems quite equal.
The universal distribution of yolk to all the cells of the segmenting egg of Fiona is probably to be correlated with the smaller size of the individual yolk globules.
It is safe to infer that each yolk body in an egg whether it be small or large is surroimded by a thin layer of protoplasm.
In eggs containing a relatively larger number of yolk globules or in other words where they are small in size a greater amount of cytoplasm will be distributed throughout the egg when compared with that aggregated around the nucleus than is the case when the single aggregations of yolk are large.
When this is the case and division occurs the whole mass will be more influenced b nuclear and cytoplasmic divisional activit than when the cytoplasmic constituents are more definitely separated from the yolk.
Just what this activity is we do not know but a comparative study of eggs showing large macromeres with those like Fiona in which cleavage is more equal will I think show that in the former case the individual yolk masses are much larger than in the latter thus allowing for greater cytoplasmic influence where more finely divided yolk is found.
The more equal division of cells naturally results in a wider spread of yolk through the developing organism and it might also be added as a corollary to this that the absorption of more finel divided yolk is doubtless much more readily accomplished than where large globules are fomid thus rendering it possible that such a wide distribution should occur in cells not alimentarv'in function.
r Before segmentation the nucleus lies but slightly above the center of the egg having moved doAvnward with its surrounding mass of granular protoplasm.
An extremely thin and easily ruptured vitelline membrane surrounds the egg and on account of the dehcacy of this membrane no micropyle is present.
Usuallj' one but often two or three eggs lie together within a roomy egg capsule containing also a fluid substance which does not coagulate in reagents.
In unstained fixed material and also doubtless in the living state the eggs are quite opaque from the yolk which they contain.
First Cleavage.
The first cleavage is initiated by nuclear rupture and increased evidence of stellar radiation.
With the formation and elongation of the spindle the surrounding yolk spherules give place to the more protoplasmic constituents of the cell which form the immediate nuclear environs.
The spindle as it elongates moves somewhat farther downward in the egg and lies but slightly above the equatorial plane.
In length it measures about half the diameter of the egg.
From the first constriction is almost equally marked all around the egg though slightly greater at the animal pole.
After the chromosomes have separated and are moving toward the opposite ends of the spindle one end appears somewhat higher than the other fig.
5 a position which would indicate a spiral trend of cleavage but this is not evident in the telophase and completed division for in the twocell stage the nuclei lie directly opposite each other.
As in the usual history of cleaving eggs the resulting blastomeres are at first much rounded but as their nuclei form they become closely pressed together forming a flattened contact surface between which no cleavage cavity exists fig.
6.
The nuclei together with their surrounding cytoplasm again approach the upper surface of the egg and lie at rest just beneath the surface on opposite sides of the polar bodies.
There is no evidence in their position to indicate a virtual rotation before the next cleavage as is the case in Crepidida Conklin 1897.
The daughter nuclei of the first cleavage becomes much dilated containing several nucleoli suspended in the chromatin network and surrounded by clear nuclear fluid.
The two blastomeres thus formed are equal or so nearly equal in size that they present to the observer no mark of distinction and it can only be conjectured which will form the anterior and which the posterior region of the larva.
Indeed not until the appearance of the mesentodermal cell at the close of the twentyfourcell stage can this distinction be dravm for until that time all quadrants appear identical though doubtless cytoplasmic and nuclear differentiation is present.
As a result of this similarity of all the quadrants the figures until the appearance of the mesentoderm cell have of necessity been labelled arbitrarily.
Of course even in the twocell stage lateral may be distinguished from terminal areas for by following succeeding cleavages and marking the relation which the lower polar furrow bears to the first cleavage plane and the later relation of both to the median plane of the embryo it can be determined that the first cleavage plane is obliquely transverse to the median plane.
But not until a later period does posterior become distinguishable from anterior end.
In the formation by first cleavage of two cells of equal size Fiona agrees with a large number of Mollusks and Annelids among the former of which may be mentioned Ischnochiton Heath 1899 Neritina Blochmann 1881 Crepidula Conkhn 1897 Ercolania Trinchese 1880 Tethys Viguier 1898 Planorhis Rabl 1879 and Holmes 1900 Limax Kofoid 1895 and Meissenheimer 1896 and among the latter Lepidonotus Mead 1897 and Podarke Treadwell 1901.
Unequal cleavage appears to occur as commonly as equal among Opisthobranchs examples of which are Acera Langerhans.
1873 yl pZsia Blochmann 1883 Carazzi 1900 Umbrella Heymons 1893 afid Philine Guiart 1901.
Second Cleavage.
The second cleavage results in four cells of approximately equal size.
The spindles which precede it lie at right angles to the first cleavage spindle and nearly parallel to each other the left end of each however being slightly higher than the right showing the Iseotrophic character of the division.
As cleavage proceeds this tendency becomes more marked the upper or lefthand cells A and C lying higher than the right B and D .
In consequence of this the second cleavage planes do not meet in a line at the vegetative pole but a portion of the original first cleavage plane unites them in the ventral polar furrow Querfurche or Brechimgslinie the cells B and D being in contact below while A and C never meet at the lower pole.
At the upper pole no furrow is present in Fiona the four cells all joining in a common central point.
As is the rule among Annelids and Mollusks in which the second cleavage is laeotropic the ventral polar furrow taken in connection with the first cleavage plane bends to the right when viewed from the animal pole and vice versa it turns to the left if considered as a part of the second cleavage plane.
Fiona is no exception to the above 334 rule and by observing the position of this furrow the first and second cleavage planes may be kept distinctly in mind until outwardly visible differential changes in the quadrants present other landmarks for orientation.
Origin of Germ Layers.
Segregation of the Ectoblast.
By the next three divisions in which the four macromeres participate the entire ectoblast arises.
First Quartet.
 The sjjindles which precede the appearance of the first quartet of micromeres lie at first nearly radial their proximal ends being distinctly higher than the distal.
As a rule all four spindles do not show the same stage of karyokinetic activity though irregularities of this nature are not as yet greatly marked fig.
9.
As division proceeds they turn in a dexiotropic direction and with associated cytoplasmic constrictions four small cells are given off toward the animal pole PI.
XXII figs.
10 11.
These the first quartet of micromeres are in size about onefourth that of their parent macromeres.
As they round out in shape they are pushed farther toward the right and finally come to he in the furrows to the right of the large cells from which they arose.
With the completion of cleavage the whole egg again takes on a decidedly rounded contour the micromeres changing materially in shape becoming more flattened on their outer surfaces and sharpangled below to fit the indentations between the macromeres fig.
14.
Second Quartet.
 The second quartet arises laeotropically thus regularly alternating in direction of cleavage with the first.
The derived micromeres are but slightly smaller than the underlying cells from which they arise and are pushed strongly toward the left as they are given off.
By this movement the four cells of the first quartet are also carried somewhat to the left though the rotation is not great.
All the second quartet cells are alike in size there being no sign of increase in D quadrant as is the case with many Annelids and some Mollusks nor is there marked difference in their time of origin though in future cleavages of the egg irregularities in the time at which divisions occur in similar cells of the four quadrants become more and more marked.
In cytoplasmic structure these cells appear to differ httle from their parent macromeres though probably they contain less yolk.
Their ultimate position is opposite and beneath the division walls of the first quartet but they do not appear to become so flattened as their predecessors figs.
13 14.
The Trochohlasts.
 Before the macromeres again divide the first quartet is seen to be in process of cleavage.
There result eight cells of nearly equal size the more peripheral being slightly smaller than those at the apical pole.
The spindles which precede division are Iseotropically directed and the lower cells are pushed downward and outward between the second quartet cells and just above the macromeres figs.
15 16.
These primary trochoblasts or turret cells do not again divide until about sixty cells are present PI.
XXV figs.
33 38 when they have become considerably flattened and he between the arms of the forming ectoblastic cross.
The fate of these very characteristic cells will be discussed later.
Third Quartet and First Division of Second Quartet.
 The first division of the second quartet and the third division of the macromeres occur simultaneously.
Each second quartet cell forms two of equal size by a distinctly dexiotropic cleavage the spindles being from the first inclined in that direction.
As may be seen in figs.
17 and 18 these cells do not all divide at exactly the same time and this lack of regularity is also characteristic of the macromeres.
By this division of the second quartet the eight cells of the first are pushed backward dexiotropically so that in relation to the macromeres they occupy the same place as when given off.
The division of the macromeres results in the four cells of the third quartet.
They arise in a dexiotropic manner and are equal in size to the four cells left at the lower pole.
From this stage on these latter are macromeres in name only being equalled in size by the third quartet and but shghtly larger than the eight derivatives of the second.
Nor indeed do the macromeres appear at this stage to contain much more yolk than the micromeres.
At a later period they are easily discernible from the micromeres by their clear yellow appearance but as the latter divide much more rapidly and by growth distribute the yolk which they contain over a larger area while much of it is doubtless absorbed the preponderance of this material in the individual cells of the endoderm and the larger cells of the mesoderm as well is easily explained.
As has been mentioned before in the larva the amount of yolk in ectodermal structures is quite considerable showdng its wide and universal distribution throughout the entire organism.
The twentyfourcell stage has thus been reached and as yet the egg is radially symmetrical PI.
XXIII fig.
19.
At the center of the upper pole lie four apical cells while the  trochoblasts  or turret cells extend from them into the angles between the second and third quartet cells.
The third quartet and first generation of second quartet lie between them and the macromeres beneath lut from the nature of the cleavages do not form so marked a ring as in Crepidula or other Mollusks with large macromeres.
The ectoblast has been entirely separated from the underlying macromeres which contain all of the entoblast and the greater portion of the mesoblast.
A small portion of the latter is to be derived as will be shown later from the third quartet of ectoblast cells.
The egg has become somewhat flattened along its polar axis and within is a small cleavage cavity which arose during the last few divisions and which later becomes of considerable size.
Upon the lower surface the polar furrow remains distinct and offers a convenient means of orientation.
The fact that in Mollusks Annelids and Platodes the entire ectoblast is separated from the entoblast by the first three successive divisions in which the macromeres participate is a point of similarity of the highest importance in considering the question of the possible genetic relationships of the groups.
With scarcely an exception Dreissensia Meissenheimer 1901 this is accomplished by regularly alternating spiral cleavages.
In most cases the first three quartets of micromeres are small protoplasmic cells and differ widely from the yolkladened macromeres and this is particularly true of the first series being correlated with the later history of the cells which compose it since in all cases they form the apical pole and the sense organs of the larva.
Where much yolk is not present or the spherules are small more equal cleavage results so that the macromeres are reduced in size  as examples may be cited many Pulmonates Planorbis Physa Limncea Limax and Lamellibranchs  Unio Cyclas Dreissensia Chiton and Ischnochiton among the Amphineura Trochus for the Prosobranchs and the Opisthobranchs Tethys and Fiona.
The same is true of many Annelids Podarke Amphitrite Clymenella Arenicola etc..
Both in size of cells and rate and direction of division the egg of Tethys Viguier 1898 exactly parallels that of Fiona up through the twentyfourcell stage.
The same may be said of Aplysia Carazzi 1900 and Georgeovitch as corrected by Carazzi 1900 except for the larger size of the macromeres particularly the anterior ones and Carazzi's statement that the trochoblasts arise from dinsion of the first quartet  con fusi distintamente dessiotropici.
Such is however not the case as his figures show.
Carazzi has evidently in some unaccountable way become confused with regard to the direction of cleavage of these cells for in another place after quoting Conklin's statement regarding the trochoblasts of Crepidula that these cells continue to rotate in a clockwise direction he adds E la sua fig.
16 mostra i fusi dessiotropic.
As any one acquainted with celllineage work can see by reference to the figure mentioned the upper ends of the spindles all lie to the left of the lower and if there be any question as to the ultimate Iseotropic direction of these cleavages a glance at Conklin's fig.
17 removes all doubt.
In Trochus Robert 1903 Crepidula Conklin 1897 and Fiona the trochoblasts are given off by division of the four cells of the first quartet before the second quartet cells divide.
In the case of Trochus the second cjuartet is just being formed when the trochoblasts divide.
Ioreover Trochus shows no rest stage at twentyfour cells as do the other two for while the third cuartet is forming and the second is dividing for the first time all eight cells of the first quartet again divide and these cleavages are followed by renewed division of second quartet cells.
The mesoblast cell 4d does not form in Trochus at this time but much later sixtyfourcell stage while in Crepidula and Fiona it appears immediately after a short rest period following the twentyfourcell stage.
The sequence of cleavages of Planorhis Holmes 1900 up to the twentyfourcell stage closely follows Crepidula and Fiona.
Segregation of EntoMesohlast.
After a period of rest during which no cells are dividing and twentyfour are present in the egg cleavage occurs in one of the macromeres.
This macromere corresponds to that which has heretofore been arbitrarily designated 3D and from this period onward the four quartets may be definitely distinguished.
The division is Iseotropic and the larger daughter cell 4d will later gradually sink into the segmentation cavity forming a depression at the posterior end of the vegetative surface in the angle formed by the macromeres 3C and 4D and otherwise bounded by 3d 3c and the derivatives of 2d.
4d is thrown toward the left and therefore in the direction of the median plane though at first it does not lie quite in that plane but slightly to the left of it or in terms of spiral cleavage to its right PI.
XXIV fig.
24.
In contradistinction to conditions found in heavily yolkladened eggs this cell takes on from the beginning the position of a middle germ layer coming shortly to lie within the cleavage cavity though as will be seen later its derivatives do not all appear to be mesodermal in character.
After all three quartets and also the macromeres with the exception 22 of 4D have divided and when there are present about 44 cells fig.
25 4d or as it hereafter will be designated more usually the mesentoblast ME diddcs dexiotropically into cells of equal size.
Before their next cleavage occurs the egg contains about seventy cells fig.
42.
By this division which is bilateral one small cell arises anteriorly from each of the large ones figs.
42 49.
The small cells E and E correspond to the Primary Enteroblasts  of Conklin and will be so designated.
Considerable variation may be observed in different eggs as to the later position of these cells as in some they appear to have moved backward along the sides of the large cells Me Me from which they arose but as a rule they remain in close relation to 4D and always in later stages may be seen associated with the derivatives of this cell from which it is hard to distinguish them PI.
XXIX figs.
71  73.
The large cells soon divide again into almost equal parts though the posterior and dorsal pair mz mz are slightly smaller fig.
71.
These latter soon divide again giving rise to two small cells z and z which are posterior to the larger fig.
73.
Just before this cleavage the two cells Me Me divide giving rise anteriorly and toward 4D to two small cells e and e corresponding to the Secondary Enteroblasts of Conklin which lie close to the first pair of small cells E E the four forming a group of little cells with deeply staining nuclei in close contact with 4D 5C and 5B.
Behind them lie the large cells M M.
In the nomenclature used these would correspond to Mesoblastic Teloblasts but before they begin to function directly as such each again divides giving off a small cell laterally and these two cells appear to be dorsally directed toward the cleavage cavity above and to the sides of the enteron but may remain associated with E E e and e.
However this may be the mesoblastic teloblasts soon begin to divide giving off an irregular row of cells which extend around the gastrula laterally.
The cells m and m also behave in a similar manner their derivatives being closely associated with those of the large teloblasts.
In figures 80 81 and 82 only the derivatives of the latter are shown the other lying dorsal to them.
As the teloblasts and the cells m and m didde they diverge laterally and leave behind and between them the smaller cells E E e e closely associated with the posterior elements of the enteron.
When these cells are first given off they lie decidedly above the level of the enteric invagination projecting upward into the cleavage cavity and while in this position might well be characterized as mesodermal elements  but later they change their position slipping in between the teloblasts and the posterior cells of the enteron and by the time the teloblasts begin to separate and wander toward the sides of the gastrula these small cells which have been derived from 4d lie nearer the ventral surface than the cells which form the bottom of the invaginating enteron and closely appressed against the posterior boundary of this region.
The small cells z z which are the posterior derivatives of the division of mz mz also continue to lie near the median line in the posterior region of the gastrula closely pressed and flattened against the ectoderm.
The later history of the enteroblasts which I believe are concerned in the formation of the intestine will be discussed in connection wth the development of the enteron.
In comparing the mesoblast formation of Fiona with that of other forms Crepidula will be considered first since in this Prosobranch 4d was first found to contain both entoblastic and mesoblastic material Conklin 1897.
Here 4d arises when twentyfour cells are present and by a Isotropic division.
This cell soon cleaves dexiotropically into two of equal size.
At the next cleavage there result in Crepidida four cells of similar size the posterior and lower pair being the first enteroblasts while in Fiona it is the anterior smaller cells which are entoblastic.
At the next cleavage in Crepidula the large cells Me Me which still contain both mesoblast and entoblast give off smaller purely mesoblastic cells anteriorly m m' while in Fiona the larger posterior cells give rise posteriorly to similar cells though they may not be purely mesoblastic.
The next cleavage of Me Me in Crepidula completely segregates mesoblast and entoblast the cells of the latter lying posterior to the mesodermal elements.
This division separates two more small enteroblasts in Fiona which here lie with the first enteroblasts anterior to the large cells IVP jVP each gives rise to another small cell anteriorly in Fiona which may be enteroblastic otherwise from this period on they function as teloblasts of the mesoderm.
From the above comparison it is evident that if we consider the position of the mesodermal and endodermal constituents of 4d in connection with the segmented egg as a whole directly opposite conditions are found.
In Crepidula the derivatives of this cell form mesoderm anteriorly and laterally entoderm posteriorly while in Fiona the reverse is the case.
But in both forms if we consider the position of the enteroblasts not in relation to the egg as a whole but only in connection with the macromeres with which they are to be associated it will be seen that in both Crepidula and Fiona these cells are directed toward the posterior region of the cells 4D 4C or their derivatives and that the reverse relations of the enteroblasts and meso340 April blasts in Crepidida and Fiona is the direct result of epibolic gastrulation in the one case embohc in the other which is in turn caused by the quantity and nature of the yolk which the macromeres contain.
An intermediate condition is found in Nereis Wilson 1898.
Textfigure 1 a shows a sagittal section through the cleaving egg of Crepidula after one enteroblast has been separated from the mesoblast.
The ectoblast has here but half covered the yolk and the entoblastic element is thrown downward and backward in the direction in which it must go if it follows the ectoderm over the yolk and finally reaches a position posterior to the blastopore as that structiue is closing Conklin's fig.
61.
In Nereis textfigure 1 b the ectoderm has advanced much farther over the yolk when the enteroblasts arise and here we see that these elements are also directed downward but at the same time anteriorly.
The next and last step in their change of position is illustrated by Fiona textfigure 1 c in which on account of its invaginate gastrula the enteroblasts are not only anteriorly directed 3ut also at first lie higher than the cells from which they arose.
In Trochus Robert 1903 the mesoblast arises at about the sixtyfourcell stage by a Iseotropic division which separates the very large cell 4d from 4D.
This cell divides dexiotropically and equally when eightynine cells are present.
When there are one hundred and eighteen cells each of the two derivatives of 4d divides and of the resulting four cells the anterior pair are the smaller.
Later the two larger posterior cells divide.
Robert has not found endodermal elements to arise from 4d'but does not reject the possibility of such a condition.
As might be expected from their close relationship a nearer correspondence in the cleavage series is found when we compare Fiona with Fig.

The enteroblasts are lined the mesoblastic cells stippled.
Umbrella although Heymons' conclusion regarding the fate of the descendants of 4d is at wide variance with the conditions which are found in Fiona.
After the cleavage of 4d into equal parts Heymons states that two small cells are given off from these so that they lie in the posterior region of the macromeres.
It is very evident from his figures that these cells which would correspond to E E of Fiona at first lie quite dorsal to the enteron and in the cleavage cavity.
The large cells next divide nearly equally the most posterior being slightly smaller and corresponding in size and origin to mz mz.
These latter shortly change their position in Umbrella exactly as in Fiona for says Heymons ''Bald beginnt eine interessante Lagerungsverschiebung einzutreten.
Es rucken namlich die hinteren Zellen weiter nach dem animalen Pol hin und legen sic vollkommen auf die vorderen auf.
While this rearrangement is occurring and after its completion two and later other small cells are given off by the large underlying cells toward the smaller cells originally budded forth.
Exactly the same process occurs in Fiona  compare Heymons' figs.
23 and 24 with my fig.
71.
Heymons' smaller cells M' M' corresponding to mz mz of Fiona which have moved toward the animal pole of Umbrella do not appear from the account to divide again so quickly as in Fiona but that they later divide teloblastically is evident.
As has been mentioned before the small anterior cells of Umbrella which correspond to E E e e of Fiona at first lie entirely within the segmentation cavity.
Figures of later stages however Heymons' fig.
29 show that they then lie at a level with the posterior cells of the enteron D A' C etc.
 and are directly between these and the anal cells.
The same relative position is taken by the corresponding cells of Fiona.
In interpreting the results of Heymons the above point of view is somewhat different from the comparison of Conklin between Umbrella and Crepidula in which he suggests a resemblance and possible similarity of origin between the enteroblasts of Crepidula and the teloblastic cells M M M' M' of Umbrella.
In both these are large cells containing a considerable quantity of yolk about equal in size and grouped in a characteristic way  but the same may be said of the similar cells of Fiona yet they have no part whatever in the formation of the enteron though from their appearance I was led to think such might be the case before a knowledge of their later history proved otherwise.
The explanation of the whole matter lies in the axial change which the derivatives of 4d have undergone in the forms considered.
The posterior macromeres particularly D of Umbrella are relatively small the same result being here obtained as in Fiona in which the entoblastic elements are produced from the anterior rather than from the posterior side of the teloblasts.
If any of the descendants of 4d of Umbrella described bHeymons are entoblastic in nature they are those which arise in this way and these are the cells which must be compared with the enteroblasts of Crepidula and the small anterior cells in Fiona.
Viguier 1898 describes and figures the formation of the mesoderm in Tethys fimhriata as similar to that of Umbrella and a comparison of figures will show almost exact correspondence.
Like Heymons Viguier does not consider the derivatives of 4d to be other than mesodermal in fate.
Carazzi 1900 derives both mesoderm and endoderm from the cell 4d EM of Aplysia.
He states that the cleavage which forms this cell is dexiotropic in direction and such appears to be the case from his figures.
The cell 3A of Aplysia is larger than the others thus throwing 3D so much to the right of the median line that a dexiotropic cleavage is necessary to place the mesentomere upon this line.
The divisions of 4d which follow are identical with those of Fiona but Carazzi's conclusions regarding the fate of the remaining blastomeres are quite different.
Four pairs of small cells are derived from the two large cells and lie anterior to them.
These correspond in position to the four or more
enteroblasts of Fiona but by Carazzi are described as mesodermal.
Two larger cells have been given off posteriorly and correspond to mz mz of Fiona.
From each of these a small cell buds forth posteriorly the two lying near the ectoderm.
These small cells are according to Carazzi enteroblasts and go into the intestine.
Cells similar to these in origin and for the time at least in position are found in Fiona z z lying closely pressed against the ectoderm in the posterior region of the gastrula.
They are small in size and at a later time I have found it impossible to distinguish them from many small mesodermal cells which crowd that region of the gastrula.
If they do not shift their position they would naturally become involved in the formation of the distal end of the intestine either directly as hning cells of that organ or as muscle cells for its walls.
One cannot help feeling in comparing the development of the two forms and noting the great similarity in the history of the early derivatives of 4d that their fate is also the same  and the same might also be said of the small anterior elements which Carazzi indicates as mesodermal.
Lillie 1895 concluded that in Unio the derivatives of 4d were entirely mesoblastic.
The two teloblasts give origin to two small cells anteriorly which He near the enteron and are probably concerned in the formation of splanchnic musculature.
Similar conditions are found to exist in Dreissensia according to Meissenheimer 1901.
Among the Pulmonates the work of Rabl 1879 is confirmed by Holmes 1900 who finds that all the derivatives of the primary mesoblast are mesoblastic in fate.
More particularly he states that the two bilaterally placed teloblasts give rise to a pair of small cells anteriorly after which the large cells divide into equal moieties.
Wierzejski 1897 says of Physa fortinalis Dass der Modus der Bildung eines Theiles des Mesoderm bei Physa desjenigen aus der UrmesodermZellen fast ganz derselbe ist wie ihn Heymons fiir Umbrella eingehenden dargestellt.
In the last stage described the mesoderm consists of twelve cells a group of six small cells anteriorly placed behind which are a pair of UrmesodermZellen  from which they arose while behind and above lie two other rather large mesoderm cells which have given off a pair of small cells posteriorly.
Both in sequence of origin in relative position and in size this group corresponds to the similar series in Aplysia and Fiona but Wierzejski ascribes a mesodermal fate to the whole.
In Limax Meissenheimer 1896 describes the cleavage of 4d to a stage in which there are four cells the anterior pair of which are the smaller.
In fate they serve as anlagen for mesodermal structures.
Similar conclusions were also reached by Kofoid 1895 on Limax.
Heath 1899 has accurately traced the origin of the mesoblast in Ischnochiton at the seventytwocell stage and its later cleavage into cells of equal size which lie bilaterally.
At a more advanced stage two more divisions were noted giving origin to small cells dorsally and anteriorly.
Heath was unable to determine whether these cells were purely mesodermal or partly endodermal.
Mead 1897 describes for the Annelid Arenicola two small cells budded off from the bilaterally situated pair of mesodermal cells and by further division of the large teloblasts these cells are seen later Ijang at the ends of the mesodermal bands and appear to be mesodermal in fate.
The same conclusions were reached regarding Clymenella though in this case the lineage has not been traced so far.
In this Annelid the divisions of M Mresult in cells of nearly ecjual size a condition which may indicate a variation in later stages.
In 1897 Wilson having reinvestigated the history of the second somatoblast of Nereis discovered that the two small cells budded from the teloblasts toward the enteron to which in his earlier paper 1892 a mesoblastic fate was assigned are entoblastic in nature and the same he thinks probably to be true of Aricia and Spio.
Child 1900 has found for Arenicola that 4d after its first cleavage forms mesoblastic teloblasts from which later arise two bilaterallyplaced mesoblastic bands  all these cells are mesoblastic in fate and it is evident from his figures and discussion that he does not find here any entoblastic material.
Though in Sternapsis the lineage was not followed so far as that of Arenicola Child reaches the same conclusion and particularly in the latter case he states that the mesoblastic cell is purely protoplasmic and without yolk.
In the Annelid Podarke Treadwell 1901 4d arises together with the other members of the fourth quartet at the sixtyfourcell stage and is equal in size and appearance to them.
It sinks inward with the invagination which forms the enteron divides and lies in close connection with the endodermal cells.
By this didsion from the larger cells four small cells are given to the enteron while the remaining two are purely mesodermal.
Torrcy 1902 in a preliminary on the cytogeny of Thalassema assigns to the two small cells arising from the teloblasts the fate of enteroblasts in a similar manner as in the Annelids above considered.
Segmentation of the Entohlast.
Shortly after the origin of the mesentoblast 4d when the egg contains fortyone blastomeres all the macromeres except 4D are seen to be dividing Iseotropically fig.
24 with the result that three large cells 4a 4b 4c are given off from their respective macromeres.
These cells are slightly greater in size than those centrally grouped but are not so large as the cell 4d and on this accoimt we find that of the four cells 4A 4B 4C and 4D the last is the smallest nor does it again divide until over one hundred and fifty blastomeres are present.
The position of the fourth quartet may be seen in fig.
25 and those following.
When the egg contains over eighty blastomeres 4 A 4B and 4C again divide into equal moieties the outer three of which 5a 5b 5c lie to the right of the central group.
All these cells have become much flattened and form a comparatively thin roof over the segmentation cavity into which as yet invagination has not begun.
The mesentoderm has sunken completely beneath the external layer and extends forward as far as the center of the cavity figs.
45 57.
At a much later period when there are nearly one hundred and fifty cells present 4a 4b and 4c again divide figs.
71 72 73 giving off small cells to the left and outwardly 4a 4b 4c.
The invagination to form the enteron has already begun by the depression of the smaller cells which lie in the center of the vegetative pole while the small cells E E e e at the anterior end of the teloblasts have become drawn into the posterior region of the invagination except for some variation an instance of which is shown in fig.
72 where at this time they help to close that portion of the gastral pit.
As the primary enteric cells sink into the cleavage cavity the small cells E E e e come into close connection with the posterior edges of 5C 5D 4a.
Thus a more or less complete cuplike invagination is brought about among the entomeres in which the smaller elements lie at the bottom with the larger 4a2 4b 4c2 between and the small cells which have arisen from these latter lying peripheral to them.
Alwve toward the ventral surface lie small cells of the second and third quartets around the blastopore opening.
In the formation of the enteric cells the manner in which the fourth quartet arises appears to be characteristic of a number of Opisthobranchs.
This quartet is in Umbrella Heymons 1893 Aplijsia Blochmann 1883 Carazzi 1900 and Tethys Viguier 1898 as well as in Fiona larger than the macromeres remaining at the center of the vegetative pole.
The further development of the enteron will be discussed later.
Cleavage History of the Ectomeres.
As has been seen the ectoblast arises immediately after the fourcell stage by the three successively alternating cleavages in which the macromeres participate giving rise respectively to the First Second and Third Quartets of micromeres.
The cleavage history of these cells will now be taken up and their ultimate fate as far as can be determined considered.
The First Quartet.
The formation of the ''turrets lald and the ''apicals laldS leading to the radially symmetrical twentyfourcell stage has already been considered.
Shortly afterward the apical cells divide in a dexiotropic direction thus alternating with the preceding cleavage and by this division the four basal cells of the ectoblastic cross arise while between these and the central point of the egg lie the four small apical cells from which they were derived fig.
23.
Before this cleavage had occurred the upper and dextral cells of the second quartet had in each quadrant given off a small cell in a Iseotropic direction fig.
21 which after the formation of the basals occupy positions just peripheral to them and shghtly to the left.
These four small second quartet elements are the tip cells of the cross 2a2d and together with the basals and apicals form the ectoblastic cross.
From the time of its formation and until a late period of cleavage the cross of Fiona is a distinctly dexiotropic structure the apicals of the four arms lying to the right of their respective tips.
The cross is thus at the time of its formation fig.
23 composed of twelve cells of which the apicals are the central is radially symmetrical and its anterior and posterior arms lie very near to if not exactly in the median plane of the future embryo.
In the future history of this structure the tip cells will for convenience be described in connection with the rest of the cross since they are so closely connected with it.
Before further cleavage occurs in the first quartet the second and third quartets and the macromeres show marked karyokinetic activity the number of cells in the egg having increased to nearly sixty.
The basal cells and the turret cells or trochoblasts then divide simultaneously fig.
33 though considerable variation in time occurs in different eggs and in different quadrants it being however universally observed that kP divides last of the basals.
It may be noted in this connection that in all species of Crepidula examined except C. achmca the division in the basal cell of the posterior arm is delayed for a much longer period.
The direction of cleavage of the basals kPand Ib is Iseotropic and so alternating with the last those of the other two doubtful Wusually shows a laeeotropic to radial position of spindle while in Uvariations are present all the way from Iseotropic to dexiotropic.
After examining a large number of eggs the occurrence of this irregularity was more strongly confirmed and it thus appears that in this cell Ic there is a strong tendency more marked in some case's than in others toward nonalternation with resulting bilaterality of cleavage in relation to its opposite cell la'.
In Crepidula Planorhis and Ncritina the cleavage of all these basal cells is nonalternating while in Umbrella it is regularly alternating.
In Fiona it would appear that we have an intermediate condition in which though regular alternation is found in the anterior and posterior basal cells the two lateral particularly Ic show a tendency toward nonalternation under the influence of approaching bilaterality.
It is just at this time that the first distinctly bilateral cleavages occur in two cells of the third quartet in the two posterior quadrants 3d and 3c figs.
31 32 and this suggestion of bilateral divisions of the cross may be correlated with them.
However the influence toward bilaterality must be very slight as the radial symmetry of the upper pole is not disturbed to any appreciable degree.
By the divisions of the basal cells above described each arm of the cross is composed of four cells  an outer tip cell 2a2d next to it the middle cell la'kP an inner ''basal cell lai.im ich is larger than its sister middle cell and an apical lald.
S3nichronously with the cleavage of the basals occurs that of the turrets the cell of this series in each quadrant dividing into two of nearly equal size the outer being the smaller.
All divisions are dexiotropic and alternating with those by which these cells arose fig.
33.
Comparing the cleavage of the turrets with conditions found in other forms it will be noted that considerable variation exists.
While in Fiona these cells divide when there are about sixty blastomeres in the whole egg in Umbrella Heymons approximately seventy are present like Fiona all four turrets divide at relatively the same time.
In Crepidula the anterior trochoblasts do not divide until there are over one hundred cells in the egg and Conklin states that he believes the posterior ones never divide.
The trochoblasts of Trochus Robert arise very early at the sixteencell stage and have all divided when there are thirtytwo cells present.
In Planorbis Holmes finds them in division at about forty cells and Limax Kofoid shows a similar condition.
In Unio Lillie there are about fifty cells while in Ischnochiton Heath but thirtytwo when the primary trochoblasts of the latter form divide.
Thus Fiona appears to occupy an intermediate position in relation to these and other molluscan forms in which the time of cleavage of these cells has been determined.
Division next occurs in the cross at a stage of about eightyfour cells and results in the division of the apicals into eight small cells of which those lying centrally form the apical rosettes lald while the outer series are the peripheral rosettes lald of Conklin.
Direction of cleavage is Iseotropic and of the resulting ceDs the outer are the larger PI.
XXVII fig.
53.
Shortly after the rosette series are estabhshed the basal cells of all arms divide again the posterior one last.
In the anterior quadrant the spindle and resulting cells Ib and Ib lie radially in the lateral arms the division of Ic' is Inotropic that of la dexiotropic again showing bilateral influence while in Id the spindle is so strongly turned in Iseotropic direction that the resulting cells lie transversely across the posterior arm figs.
56 62.
While this last cleavage of the basals is being accomplished a similar process is seen in the four inner trochoblasts lald resulting ill eight cells of equal size and occurring at relatively the same time in all four quadrants.
With the completion of the abovedescribed divisions the large number of cells of similar size at the upper pole of the egg makes their exact lineage difficult to follow so that it is desirable to make here some comparisons with the structure and development of the cross and trochoblasts in other forms and to bring together the results already obtained before proceeding to more uncertain ground.
In formation the cross of Fiona arises in the same manner as in Umbrella and Planorbis by the completion of the tip cells before the basals  and in this it differs from Neritina and Crepidula where the tip arises shortly after division has occurred to form the four basal cells.
In Trochus the tips are relatively late in appearing as the basals have completed their cleavage before these cells arise.
At the first cleavage of the basals another striking similarity to Umbrella is found for in this Opisthobranch the cleavage is Iseotropic while in Crepidula and Neritina it is dexiotropic thus breaking the law of alternating cleavages  and likewise in Planorbis with reversed type the division is Iseotropic and nonalternating with the preceding.
Trochus shows an extremely marked Iseotropic division of these cells so much so in fact that the resulting cells he almost transversel In Fiona the anterior and posterior basals are distinctly Iseotropic in origin and so regularly alternating while considerable variation is found in the lateral arms a radial type often occurring with Ic sometimes showing a decided dexiotropic direction of spindle.
It would appear from this variation in the lateral arms that Fiona shows tendencies toward bilaterality in the first quartet at this time and such a condition would be in harmony with the lilateral cleavages of the third quartet cells 3c and 3d' occurring just previously.
However the radial symmetry of the cross as a whole appears not to be disturbed appreciably so that though these variations may show either a tendency toward bilaterahty or toward entire reversal in all quadrants as is found in Neritina Crepidida and Planorbis this influence has not as yet become sufficiently marked to affect the radial symmetry of the upper pole of the egg to any appreciable degree.
In discussing the lack of alternation of these cleavages in Crepidula as opposed to alternation in Umbrella Conklin suggests upon this difference the future recognizabiUty of the cross in the lastnamed cases Crepidula and Neritina depends.
In Umbrella the Iseotropic division of the basals is much more marked than in Fiona but even in the latter case Conklin's prediction is in part at least fulfilled as the cross of Fiona after a slightly older stage than thus far described becomes so irregular that its component cells are neither among themselves distinguishable nor may they be definitely separated from the surrounding blastomeres.
Of course this is largely due to the multiplication of the trochoblasts and the similarity in size of most of the cells upon the upper surface of the egg yet the Iseotropic twist given to the basal elements at their initial cleavage is largely responsible for that irregularity of contour which so early marks the outlines of the cross.
The peripheral ends of the arms of the cross of Fiona become strongly twisted to the left and as the structure becomes older the ends tend to bend around in that direction to a marked degree greatly confusing their component cells with those arising by multiplication of the trochoblasts.
Up to the stage shown in fig.
53 the cross has with the exception of a slight tendency toward variation in the first division of the basals been radially symmetrical but at the next cleavage of the basals the cell of this series in the posterior arm divides so that its daughter cells lie transverse to the longitudinal axis of this arm.
In the anterior quadrant this division produces cells which lie radially while in C quadrant the cleavage is Iseotropic in A dexiotropic.
The first indication of transverse splitting of the arms is thus seen to occur in the basal cell of the posterior quadrant.
In Crepidula the reverse is the case the anterior and lateral arms alone increasing in width while the posterior later elongates by radial cleavages.
In Fiona all the arms become longitudinally split at a later period.
The inner and outer rosettes have not A'et arisen in Crepidula when the splitting begins in the cells labc while in Fiona they are present and the egg contains many more cells the basal cells of the anterior and lateral arms having again divided in such a manner that these arms are lengthened before increase in breadth occurs.
The same is true of Planorbis.
The early splitting of the arms of the cross in Crepidula is probably in part due as Holmes suggests to the fact that through pressure they have become much wider and tend to divide in a direction opposite to this elongation.
It might also be suggested that the extreme breadth of the cross of Crepidula and the early transverse division of its anterior and lateral arms may be correlated with the presence of a large amount of yolk which must be covered b' the ectoblast while in the posterior region the extensive multiplication of the elements of the second quartet obviates the necessary broadening of the arm which reaches in that direction.
The transverse cleavage of the anterior and lateral arms of the cross of Fiona occurs shortly after the initiation of a similar process in the posterior arm but it has been found impossible to trace the lineage of all the cells accurately though after lateral extension has occurred the structure may be demarkated from the trochoblasts and underlying second quartet cells.
In fig.
75 its structure and probably cell derivation may be seen.
Holmes finds for Planorbis that the tip cells divide in a transverse direction first while in Crepidula the middle cells are the first to cleave.
The tips appear to divide last in Fiona.
In the posterior arms after the first transverse division most of the cells divide obliquely across the arms and in this way the arm becomes longer than the other three.
While the cross is increasing in lateral extension the outer turret cells of all quadrants divide so that the four groups each consist of four cells of equal size fig.
75 lying in the angles formed by the arms of the cross.
The apical pole of the egg at this period shows' a sHght depression in the region of the rosette series.
It is but transient and disappears with the elongation of the gastrula.
A similar depression has been observed in Neritina Crepidula and Trochus.
Whether the structure is normal in Fiona is yet doubtful.
Robert insists that such is the case with Trochus.
The entire formation of the cross of Trochus is peculiar.
The basals have arisen and divided before the tips appear and this division of the basals is so directly laeotropic as to be practically transverse.
At the next cleavage these two cells form an oblong group of four in each arm.
The tips which lie peripherally to these groups next divide the cleavages of 2a and 2c being bilateral the first of this nature to occur in the egg.
From the cases cited above of the manner of formation of the ectoblastic cross of Mollusks it will be seen that this characteristic structure shows great diversity of details throughout the group though fundamental similarity is evident.
Some of the probable causes of such variation are 1 varying amounts of yolk leading to early lateral extension of the arms in those forms possessing yolkladened entomeres and 2 differences in the manner and rate of development of the trochoblasts correlated with the later structure and functional importance of the locomotor organ to which they largely give rise.
The radial arrangement of blastomeres around the apical pole of the cleaving egg is primarily the result of successively alternating spiral cleavages and a similar arrangement may be expected in eggs which exhibit this mode of division.
A definitely marked cross does not always arise from such an arrangement of blastomeres as for example in Polyclad cleavage so that this but suffices as a partial explanation.
Regarding the form of the crosses of Mollusks and Annelids Conklin says The cross and rosette series are the direct result of the position size and shape of their constituent cells.
The original position of cells resulting from regularly alternating spiral cleavages is a function of that mode of division.
The shape of cells depends largely upon the relations which they bear to one another.
Their size is not so easily explained and upon this factor depends to a large extent the varying forms of crosses met with in different instances.
If it be supposed that the original arrangement of the upper pole cells of Mollusk and Annelid eggs was radial in form the modifications which have arisen in the two groups may in part at least be referred directly to the size of the cells comprising that area.
The importance and early development of the trochoblasts of Annelids has resulted in encroachment upon that area which in the segmenting eggs of these forms corresponds to the cross region of Mollusks.
As a result the ''intermediate series of Annelids corresponding to the moUuscan cross cells lack the prominence characteristic of the same cells in the latter group.
Moreover it is interesting to note that such a Mollusk as Ischnochiton which in the development of its trochoblasts and prototroch shows a condition intermediate between Mollusks and Annelids also exhibits a cross which is intermediate in character.
Though the trochoblasts have been taken here as an example of the influence which variation in size or rate of division may have upon the primitive arrangement of blastomeres in the spirally cleaving egg it is doubtless true that other cells may in like manner undergo modifications which will result in similar rearrangements.
Thus it may be concluded that the group of cells constituting the cross owes its radial arrangement primarily to the form of cleavages by which it arose but that the cross as a definitely marked structure is the result of variations in the size shape and rate of division of the cells comprising or suiTOunding it these variations leading on the one hand to the formation of the moUuscan cross' on the other to the annelid an.
Second Quartet.
Wliile the egg is yet radially symmetrical and its blastomeres number twentyfour the original second quartet cell of each quadrant has divided in a dexiotropic direction into cells of equal size.
After the mesentoblast has arisen but before the basal cells of the cross are formed all of the second quartet cells divide in a Inotropic direction the upper four giving off the four tip cells 2a2d toward the upper Dole while the lower four give origin to small cells resembling the tips in size which are directed toward the vegetative pole PI.
XXIII figs.

The second quartet at this time consists of four similar groups of cells each group consisting of two large cells 2a2d and 2a2d2' lying together with the smaller cells above and below.
The two large cells in all four quadrants 2a22d 2ar2cV next divide almost simultaneously.
The direction of cleavage of the right upper cells 2a22di2 is dexiotropic and of the resulting cells the upper 2a2d2' are slightly larger than the lower 2a''2cV  the divisions being identical in all four quadrants.
Synchronously with these divisions cleavage spindles appear in the other large cells of the second quartet 2a2P.
Of the resulting cells the lower are much the smaller.
In direction the cleavages are probably all Iseotropic and therefore nonalternating though in C and D quadrants the spindles are almost meridional in position and the cleavages horizontal.
Figures 28 29 30 31 and 32 show these divisions in the different quadrants.
The lack of alternation found in the above instance may be explained as the direct result of the relative sizes of the foregoing derivatives of the second quartet and the positions in which they lie.
By an examination of fig.
30 it will be seen that should the two large cells 2c2 and 2c have divided in the same direction a diagonal row of cells would have been the result with great pressure against one another and upon the cells in the first and third quartets at the ends of the row.
Lack of alternation in direction of cleavage in one of the cells would relieve this pressure and this is the actual condition found.
Such an explanation appears to fit this individual case of nonalternation but no generalization may be made as in many other instances the cleavage of blastomeres appears to follow no rules of mutual pressure and can be explained on no grounds so simple.
Division again occurs in this quartet at a stage of alDOut eighty cells and great variation in time is marked in their occurrence.
The following table shows the average sequence observed in the different quadrants though any one egg may show marked variation from the tabulated result 1904.

The divisions of 2a2d are Iseotropic in all quadrants of 2a2d universally dexiotropic of 2a2d everywhere dexiotropic while variation is found in the direction of cleavage in the cells 2a2d2.
Of these latter a decidedly Iseotropic direction is found in B quadrant horizontal to dexiotropic in D horizontal to Iseotropic in A and approximately horizontal in C. With regard to the size of the derivative cells it may be said in a general way that variation is evident.
More particularly considered the following conditions are found to prevail.
The divisions of 2a 2c 2d result in cells of equal size while in the case of 2b the upper cell 2b is much smaller than 2b  2a 2b 2d form upper small and lower larger parts while 2c divides equally 20 2c and 2d show similar divisions into upper small and lower large cells while 2a remains so long undivided that its derivatives are uncertain  2a2d divide equally.
As a result of the foregoing cleavages the second quartet contains in all approximately forty cells.
The irregularities which have characterized the preceding divisions are increased in number as cleavage continues though until a much later period all four quadrants show relatively the same number of cells for this quartet.
If figs.
6770 representing the different sides of the same egg be examined it will be seen that in A quadrant 2a has divided dexiotropically while 2a has divided horizontally quadrant B shows no further multipHcation of elements  in C quadrant 2c is in process of division while 2c and 2c have both given off small cells toward the upper pole D quadrant remains as before.
23 At a stage in which there are six ceDs of the second quartet in each quadrant in Crepidula these groups very closely resemble the similar ones of Fiona.
When there are four cells in each group in Crepidula the larger middle pair divide and as in Fiona one of them shows lack of alternation but in Crepidula the direction of the cleavage is slightly laeotropic in the right cell and dexiotropic in the left while just the opposite is true of Fiona.
Planorbis shows a group of second quartet cells in each quadrant which may be said in this sinistral form to be almost the mirrored image of the same cells of Fiona though the tips and the corresponding cells at the lower pole are somewhat larger in Planorbis which probably accounts for their earlier division in that form.
The large second quartet cells of Trochus as in Fiona show lack of alternation in the left cells of the series 2a2d while the right 2a2d show regular alternation.
The early cleavages in the second quartet of Tethys Viguier 1898 closely parallel those of the same series in Fiona.
Viguier has mistaken the lower elements of this quartet 2a2d for members of the fourth as Robert has pointed out.
Further note of the errors in this paper will not be taken here since they have been so thoroughly discussed by Robert.
Heymons 1893 for Umbrella shows the second quartet series up to a stage of six cells in each quadrant and here also similar conditions are found.
Carazzi 1900 figures the egg of Aplysia where each quadrant contains four second quartet cells and here also is a marked similarity to the other forms considered.
The second quartet of Fiona maintains a radial symmetry for a much longer period than Planorbis this being the result of similar cleavages in all four quadrants for a much later period than in that Pulmonate.
The same may be said of Umbrella and Crepidula and as Holmes suggests this phenomenon is probably correlated with the earlier development and larger size of the head vesicle of Planorbis than of the corresponding structure of Crepidula Umbrella or Fiona.
The Third Quartet.
Of the three quartets the third is the first to show evidences of bilateral divisions.
When the egg has cleaved into twentyfour blastomeres this quartet has but one cell in each quadrant and these cells do not divide until after the second cleavage of the second quartet.
They then all divide in a laeotropic direction but the resulting cells are not of the same size in the different quadrants.
3a and 3b produce cells of equal size while 3c and 3d give rise to small cells in the direction of the vegetative pole with very large ones above thus forming an additional landmark for distinguishing anterior from posterior quadrants PI.
XXIV fig.
25.
The larger cells of the posterior quadrants 3ci and Sd divide next the spindle in Sc being dexiotropic and alternating that of 3d laeotropic and nonalternating and this lack of alternation in one of the large cells of the third quartet taken in connection with the regular alternation of the similar cell on the opposite side of the posterior region of the egg establishes the first bilateral cleavage PI.
XXV figs.
31 32 34.
Both upper and lower cells of A and B quadrants are the next third quartet elements to divide the direction in all cases being dexiotropic or in some instances nearly meridional figs.
37 40 41.
The lower cells 3a' and 3b always divide before the upper 3a and 3b and in all cases cleavage is equal a gi'oup of four similar cells arising in each of the two anterior quadrants.
In the posterior cpadrants cleavage occurs next in 3di 3d 3cand 3c.
It will be remembered that when these cells were formed it was through a laeotropic and nonalternating division of 3d and a dexiotropic and alternating division of 3c thus producing a bilateral cleavage of similar cells of opposite sides.
Xow the cells 3c and 30again divide dexiotropically thus showing lack of alternation while 3d and 3diagain exhibit distinct Inotropic cleavage and a second failure to alternate.
Thus arise in each posterior quadrant two very smaU cells 3c2 3c22 nd 3d Sd lying below the large ones 3c 'Sc' 3d and 3cV' PI.
XXVI figs.
43 44 45 47.
After these cleavages about eighty blast omeres are present figs.
67 etc..
When this number has increased to shghtly over a hundred Ssi 3a22 3b2 and 3b2 each gives off a small cell toward the vegetative pole by cleavages which appear horizontal PI.
XXVII figs.
57 59 and these divisions are followed by equal and probably horizontal cleavages in the posterior quadrants of the large cells 3c 3di and 3c and 3di the former pair always dividing before the latter figs.
61 66 so that each posterior group contains seven cells of which three are small and he nearest the blastopore being bounded externally by four large cells 3c  1' '' and 3d ''' ' '' respectively.
The history of the third quartet of Fiona thus far given adds another to the niunber of Mollusks in which it has been found that bilateral cleavages first appear in the posterior quadrant and more particularly in the cells of the third quartet.
The initial divisions of these cells in UmhreUa appear from Heymons' description to be nearly radial but his figures show that in the case of 3c and 3d cleavage is Iseotropic.
The lower products of these cleavages are all smaller than the upper in which they parallel only the posterior quadrant cells of Fiona.
Moreover these cells 3c and 3d' divide again before the anterior ones as in Fiona and these cleavages are the first bilateral divisions described.
It would appear from Heymons' figures that the two cells next the median plain lie higher than the outer and this is the condition found in Fiona.
If such be the case these two forms stand in contradistinction to Crepidula in which the median pair are the lower.
The cells 3c 3d are the protoblasts of Heymons' excretory cells and it will be seen later that 3c serves a similar purpose in Fiona It is interesting to note that Conklin says of 3c and 3d that they are large and clear and have the same characteristics in Crepidula'  though he does not know their fate.
Heymons describes divisions at a later stage in the anterior quadrants while in the posterior 3c and 3c 3d and 3d' give rise by horizontal divisions to small cells which lie next to 3c and 3d  these latter in exact correspondence with Fiona.
Of this quartet Holmes says of PZanor6ts The first cleavage forms a transition from the spiral to the bilateral type and subsequent cleavages show a bilateral character in a more marked degree.
At nearly the same time the lower pair of cells in the two anterior quadrants and the upper pair of cells in the posterior quadrants divide in a nearly horizontal direction into equal moieties.
Later the upper pair of cells in the anterior quadrants divide in the same direction as the lower pair.
The lower pair of cells in the two posterior quadrants remain undivided until a much later stage.
These divisions closely follow those of Fiona and the same may be said of subsequent ones.
In Aplysia Carazzi the two third quartet cells of each anterior quadrant divide into equal moieties while in the posterior quadrants small cells are given off toward the vegetative pole the same is true of Fiona.
At the next divisions of 3c' and 3d' si dividono con fusi iransversali cioe con divisione bilaterale while 3a' and 3b' remain at Test.
Viguier 1898 for Tethys describes the initial division of all the foiuquartet cells as suivant des plans sensiblement radiaux the resulting two cells in each quadrant being equal.
Later cleavages of this quartet in Fiona will be considered under the discussion of oastrulation and secondary mesoderm formation.
Bilaterality appears late in the cleavage of Trochus.
The first divisions of this nature do not occur imtil the ninetysevencell stage and are concerned with the cells 2c and 2a.
This is the first violation of SachsHertwig's law of alternatingly perpendicular cleavages.
The cleavages of the third quartet are very tardy in this Prosobranch for when there are as many as one hundred and fifty cells present this quartet consists of but four cells in each quadrant.
Gastrulation.
With the beginning of gastrulation marked differences appear in the cleavages of the quadrants and the radial symmetry of the egg as a whole gives place to a more and more distinct bilaterality.
In the posterior region particularly among the cells of the second quartet great divisional activity and growth takes place while the same series in A C and B quadrants show relatively slight increase when compared with the derivatives of 2d.
It has been impossible to follow the lineage except in particular instances from the time these cleavages begin as most of the cells of the gastrula of Fiona are so similar in size and appearance and the nvimber becomes so great that individual identification is limited to special cases.
However by continued observation of successively developing stages one becomes famihar with the cell groups which will later give rise to various organs and aided by a few landmarks may in most cases follow the organogeny Avith approximate if not absolute certainty.

'ji examination of figs.
69 and 70 will show that 2biiand 2b22 have divided again and shortly afterward cleavage occurs in a number of other cells 2b2 2b etc.
The upper cells of the tliird quartet in the anterior quadrants lie at fii'st well toward the upper surface but as invagination proceeds these move around toward the lower side while an increasing number of second quartet elements are found separating the first from the third quartet at the anterior as well as the posterior end of the gastrula.
Meanwhile the second quartet cells in the median posterior region derivatives of 2d have multiplied very rapidly and by causing increase in the surface area of the gastrula in this region have pushed the apical pole several degrees forward.
Not only have the posterior second quartet cells increased in numbers but also in size marking out at an early period the region from which the shell gland vdW develop.
The second quartet groups which he laterally below the ends of the lateral arms of the cross also grow in extent and nimibers this being more particularly true of those which abut upon the enlarging cells of the same series in D quadrant.
The history of the third quartet has thus far been followed to a stage when its members in each anterior quadrant number six of which four are large and two small cells while in each posterior quadrant the group comprises seven cells three of which are small and four large.
By approximately horizontal cleavages of the upper cells in the two anterior quadrants four cells of equal size are formed in each quadrant and as the blastopore continues to narrow these cells migrate as a group m each of the two anterior cjuadrants approaching the blastopore and slipping over the cells 3b and 3b 3a' and 3a which lie between them and the smaller cells of the same series PI.
XXIX figs.

During this period the third cpiartet blastomeres of the posterior quadrants remain as before.
The blastopore thus becomes entirely surrounded by the second and third quartet elements of which the third are much more numerous having the small cells 2a2dor their derivatives wedged in between them on the median and transverse line.
The gastrula taken as a whole is much flattened dorsoventrally and is at first shorter in its longitudinal than transverse axis.
The blastopore assumes a slitlike form its longitudinal axis corresponding to the future longitudinal axis of the embryo.
The next important change to be olserved is the origin of the EctoMesoblast.
As the cells 3a  '' ' and 3b.
 ' 'continue to move toward the blastopore the cells which they are covering over 3a 3a and 3b 3b sink downward into the segmentation cavity.
As this occurs they all four divide giving rise externally and in the direction of the blastopore to four small cells 3a 3a and 3b 312212 while the larger daughter cells continue to retreat beneath the overgrowing ectoderm fig.
74.
These larger cells 3aS 3a2 3b and 3b are the source from which the secondary mesoderm is derived.
They later divide as may be seen in fig.
78 and begin at once to form two bands of several cells each which lie in the anterolateral region of the gastrula and later in the anterior head region of the larva.
Since the discovery by Lillie in 1895 of mesoderm which arose from the ectoderm in the Lamellibranch Unio various other celllineage workers have arrived at similar conclusions concerning other forms.
As is well known Lillie found that the larval musculature of the Giochidium arose from a cell of the second quartet 2a which in cleavage gives rise to a cell toward the segmentation cavity the descendants of which are mesodermal in fate.
Conklin's results published in 1897 gave evidence that in the Gasteropod Crepidula ectodermal mesoderm arose in three quadrants in this case also from the second quartet 2a 2b and 2c but appearing much later then the ''larval mesoblast of Lillie so late in fact that the exact cell origin could not be traced.
1904.
359 In 1897 Wierzejski showed that in the sinistral Pulmonate Physa secondary mesoblast arises from certain derivatives of the third quartet 3c and 3b and similar conclusions were reached in the same year for Planorhis by Holmes 3c and 3b here also giving rise to cells which sink into the segmentation cavity.
The formation of the secondary mesoderm in Fiona is strikingly siinilar to its manner of origin in Planorhis as described by Holmes.
The following diagram textfigure 2 showing the cleavage history of the ectomesomeres of the two forms indicates how close a comparison is possible.
S 03 00 Fig.
2.
 Diagrams showing the manner of formation of secondary mesoderm in at Planorhis Holmes and 6 Physa Wierzejski and Fiona.
The cells 3ontaining secondary mesoderm are stippled.
It will be noted that four cells of each anterior quadrant are mesodermal in Planorhis while in Fiona only two have this fate the smaller cells 3a  and 3b  of Fiona remaining in the ectoderm.
For Physa Wierzejski came to similar conclusions but here there is even closer correspondence for the cells 3b  and 3c  of Physa remain in the ectoderm exactly as they do in Fiona.
According to the nomenclature used by these two investigators secondary mesoblast arises from quadrant B and C while in the dextrally cleaving egg of Fiona it comes from quadrant A and B. Holmes and Wierzejski have attempted to use the same sequence of lettering for sinistral forms as that commonly employed for the dextral and have thus been led into error Holmes particularly arguing for a nonhomology of cells upon this score.
When the dextral or clockwise sequence is employed for a sinistral form this difference in designation necessarily results if the cell which is to give rise to the entomesoblast be labelled D. The more natural and logical method is to label the cells of a sinistral form in an anticlockwise sequence as Crampton 1894 has very wdsely done for Physa.
Robert 1903 in his excellent paper on the development of Trochus wliieh has just reached this laboratory calls attention to the above and confirms opinions which had already been embodied in this paper.
Animals which are sinistral or reversed in their larval and adult stages develop from eggs which are hkewise reversed in their cleavage and the designation of the blastomeres of the egg should coincide with the condition of the adult if any homology of cells exists.
The eggs of sinistral Gastropods have probably at an early stage in their ovarian development undergone complete cytoplasmic and nuclear inversion for only by such a process can the reversed condition of the larvse and adults be understood or the reversal of direction of the cleavage spindles be explained and if such an inversion be postulated corresponding reversal of sequence in nomenclature must ensue.
Meissenheimer 1901 describes in Dreissensia a cell lying in the cleavage cavity just under the First Somatoblast derivatives but which he says does not come from this group though he is sure it is of ectodermal origin.
It later divides and forms muscle fibers.
Similar conditions appear to be present in Cyclas Zeigler 1885.
In the freshwater Prosobranch Paludina teloblastic pole cells are not found.
Scattered mesenchyme cells occur and Tonniges 1896 states that these have been produced from cells which lie in front of the blastopore.
If this be the case the formation of mesoderm in Paludina is similar to that of the secondary mesoderm of other MoUusks.
In Dinophilus the cleavage of which is from work now being done in this laboratory by Dr. J.
A. Nelson typically annehdan in character SchimkeTsitsh 1895 appears to have recognized ectomesoblast for he says  Gleichzeitig with the proliferation of Urmesodermzellen aber findet auch eine Immigration der Ectodermzellen in der Vordertheil des Embryos statt und es wird durch diese Zellen eine Mesemchymanlage gebildet.
In the Annehd Aricia Wilson 1897 discovered mesoderm arising from the two posterior quadrants which could not be derived from the pole cells and which he located as coming from either the second or third quartet i.e. from c and d or from c and c.
These conclusions were strengthened by a preliminary account of Treadwell 1897 on the cell lineage of Podarke in which he derives secondary mesoblast from the tliird quartet 3a 3c and 3d and these results are confirmed in a later and more elaborate paper 1901.
The account of the mesoderm formation given by Eisig 1898 for Capitella differs widely from the results of most workers on annelidan and molluscan embryology.
 Here the definitive mesoblast is said to arise from 3c and 3d which would be in correspondence withWilson's ectomesoblast while what Eisig considers larval or secondary' mesoblast comes from that portion of 4d which Wilson and Treadwell found in Nereis and Podarke to form part of the wall of the enteron.
These results have it seems justly been called in question though the careful investigation from which they spring certainly gives credence to their accuracy.
Treadwell 1901 has called attention to certain figures PI.
XXXIX fig.
42 to PI.
XL fig.
49 of Hatschek on Eupomatus which show scattered muscle cells in the upper hemisphere of the larva which could hardly have come from the feebly developed mesoderm bands at the posterior end of the body and suggests that they are of secondary origin and he likewise calls attention to the figures of Drasche 1884 for Pomatoceros which show similar conditions though neither of these investigators appears to have realized their significance.
In a preHminary paper on the development of the mesoblast in Thalassema Torrey 1902 derives ectomesoblast from all three quartets.
In all there are at least twenty primaiy cells of this character but of them only ten arising from the first and third quartets develop into functional mesenchyme while at least ten degenerate and are finally absorbed by the entoblasts.
The greater part of the functional ectomesoblast comes from three cells of the third quartet 3a 3c and 3d which correspond closely to those which produce secondary mesoblast in Podarke.
All of the cells arising from the second quartet and which sink into the segmentation cavity are rudimentary and in the end entirely degenerate thus recalling AVilson's similar conclusions regarding the rudimentary cells of the definitiAe mesoblast of Aricia and Spio.
At least six derivatives of the seven ectomesoblast cells which Torrey derives from the first quartet have a similar fate.
The mesoderm of Platodes Annelids and Mollusks has of late years been subject to much studj and various theories have been propounded regarding the significance of the manner of formation of the middle germ layer of these groups.
Without entering into a prolonged discussion with regard to this question a few of the more general points may be mentioned.
The results above tabulated and my own observations lead to the conclusion  which is of course not here stated as new  that the primitive mesoderm of these groups is represented by that which arises from the ectoderm and which is alone found in the Polyclad Wilson.
The suggestion of Wilson that upon this hypothesis ectomesoblast might well be found arising from all three quartets of ectomeres has just been verified by the work of Torrey and shows that in this respect Thalessema presents an ancestral condition similar to that of the Polyclad though this does not necessarily imply close genetic relationship.
Moreover a descending series may be formed both among Annelids and Mollusks of forms in which the presence of ectomesoblast gradually merges into conditions in which it has totally disappeared showing that in these groups ectodermal formation of mesoderm is on the decline.
The increasing number of cases reported in which ectomesoblast is larval in fate tend also to support this conclusion nor do the results of Meyer showing that much of this building material is used for adult structures offer a serious objection since it is a wellknown fact that nature is not prodigal of the living substance on which it works and the secondary application of ancestrally obsolete material is a fact of almost universal occurrence.
Nor can I see that the later origin of ectomesoblast necessarily indicates its late phylogenetic appearance as some have argued since the early origin of entomesoblast if associated with the future elongation of the animal might well be supposed to be directly explained ly the precocious segregation of this layer in those forms in which its development is so intimately connected with future growth and development.
The early appearance and teloblastic growth of entomesoblast in the posterior region of Annelids and Mollusks has directly led to decrease of the radially appearing mesoblast.
The Polyclad which shows no endomesoblast has failed to develop such a formation though a tendenc in that direction may be appearing being marked by the bilateral division of one of the endodermal derivatives Wilson.
The fact that ectomesoblast as well as entomesoblast has been shown among Annelids to arise from the same quadrant Aricia Podarke Thalassema argues it seems to me conclusively for an entirely separate mode of origin of the two.
Closure of the Blastopore.
With the segregation of the secondary mesoblast changes appear in the form of the gastrula.
Heretofore its shape has been broadly oval the anteroposterior axis being the shortest but at this period two regions of growth become manifest leading to marked change of form.
The multiplication and growth of cells of the second quartet in the posterior region increase in activity ever pushing forward the apical pole area while at the same time the region just anterior to the apical pole is seen to be rising from the surrounding surface forming a pointed projection the summit of which lies at the anterior end of the forward arm of the cross PI.
XXX figs.
78 79.
Synchronously with these changes the blastopore continues to decrease in size being narrowed by overgrowth of cells in that neighborhood.
It will be seen by the examination of fig.
78 that the large cells of the third quartet in the anterior quadrants 3a    and 3b    are all encroacliing farther upon the smaller cells of the same series which have been crowded beneath them at the edge of the blastopore.
Posteriorly derivatives of the third quartet have completely surrounded the blastopore by the division and migration backward of the small cells 3c and 3d while more laterally the remaining small cells of this quartet and their neighboring larger cells are crowding aroimd the depression.
The second quartet cells 2a and 2c22 or their derivatives yet lie in the lateral corners but as closure of the blastopore proceeds they are crowded from this position by encroachment of the third quartet both from before and behind which finally fig.
79 join each other on the sides.
In the anterior median plane however a cleft yet remains between the large third quartet cells and after the inner of these large cells have divided as shown in fig.
79 cells of the second quartet represented by the derivatives of 2b still occupy the space between them and there bound the blastopore.
Throughout this process the greatest extension of the third quartet is manifest in the area covered by the posterior third quartet groups and this is doubtless connected vdth the disappearance from the ectoderm in the anterior groups of the secondary mesoblast.
The blastopore closes from behind forward to which process the larger number of third quartet cells in the ectoderm of the posterior region conduces.
The posterior surface of the gastrula is now covered by large cells of the third quartet and in the median region by second quartet elements.
On the right posterior surface left when seen from ventral surface fig.
79 may be seen one very large cell Ex.
3c which will later become the principal excretory cell of the larva.
The region anterior to the blastopore has been formed from the second quartet cells of B quadrant which have been pushed backward by posterior and apical growth space being left for them through the shiftmg of the large cells of the third quartet already described.
The second quartet cells of B quadrant have shown comparatively little division or growth and thus appear to occupy a relative
 smaller space than previously.
The blastopore of Crepidula Conklin is surrounded by second and third quartet cells all quadrants contributing.
The same is true for Ischnochiton Heath.
In Trochus Robert third quartet cells are mainly concerned in the closure of the blastopore though the deri'atives of 2a2d also bound the narrowing opening.
Planorbis Holmes shows a very similar condition vdth the exception that 2d is crowded out.
In Fiona all second quartet cells but a few at' the anterior edge of the blastopore are excluded before the opening closes.
Orgaxogexy.
The Velum.
In its earlier stages the velum of Fiona is so illdefined on the upper surface of the developing larva that its study has proved most difficult and though more time has been spent upon this region than any other portion of the developing organism the results have not been as satisfactory as could be wished.
living material would have been of great value and the lack of it has been a source of much regret.
After the breaking up of the cross the whole external surface of the gastrula and particularly the anterior end is characterized by cells of small and nearly equal size among which there appear scarcely any cells whose size would give them prominence or cell rows or distinctly marked groups.
In the last stage described under the discussion of the development of the first quartet the area covered by this series of micromeres represents nearly the whole upper surface of the flattened gastrula fig.
75.
The four arms of the cross are split transversely while in the angles between them lie the four groups of turret cells each group consisting of four cells of equal size.
In axial relation the anterior and posterior arms correspond to the direction of the median plane while the lateral are respectively right and left.
The Avhole first quartet area is completely surrounded and separated from the tliird by derivatives of the second.
By an increased growth of D quadrant of this series the apical pole and its surrounding area is moved forward in the direction of the blastopore while at the same time growth of first and second quartet elements in the neighljorhood of the tip of the anterior arm of the cross causes that region to become raised until somewhat later the pointed anterior end so characteristic of many Opisthobranch larvas is produced figs.
78 79 96.
The visible cause of the evagination of the ectoderm at this point may be found in the directions taken by spindles of the dividing cells which produce it as in most cases they are radially or diagonally directed toward the point of greatest elevation.
At this time the archenteron is roughly triangular in outline the anterior point of the triangle being marked by the large cell 4b which remains for a long time in this position and is closely pressed up into this anterior cone.
It may thus be possible that the pointed anterior end of the larva is caused by the shape of the enteron upon which the outer layer is moulded.
At first the terminal point of elevation corresponds in position to the tip of the anterior arm and is thus formed by derivatives of 2b' and neighboring cells.
At a somewhat later period the continued growth of the shell gland area pushes the whole apical region forward so that eventually figs.
95 98 100 this point is carried farther downward on the anterior surface.
At the same time continued growth has increased the extent of the whole apical region so that the anterior end becomes more rounded than pointed and finally figs.
101 102 when the veliger stage is just being approached a broad rounded contour characterizes the anterior as well as the posterior end of the larva.
It is while these changes are taking place that the first evidence of a distinct velar area appears.
Early in this period of forward movement the anterior trochoblasts may be seen to the right and left of the anterior end of the forward arm being distinguished from the derivatives of the second quartet by their smaller size and compact arrangement.
They thus with the tip cell and two other cells behind them probably IbS Ib derived by transverse splitting of the middle cell form an irregular row across the anterior edge of the first quartet area fig.
76.
Laterally the posterior ends of this semicircle are joined by cells in the region of the tips of the lateral arms and thus meet the posterior trochoblast groups.
These latter have grown larger than their corresponding cells in the anterior quadrants and so are almost indistinguishable from second quartet elements which lie beneath them.
On this account it soon becomes impossible to separate them from these cells and so at a later period when the velum in this region becomes marked I am imable to state how much of it is derived from the trochoblasts though the httle evidence at hand indicates that they form the largest portion of it.
With change of axis the anterior end of the velum is carried forward PL XXXVII figs.
95 98 and the forward end comes upon a level with the anteroventral surface.
A lateral view fig.
98 shows an irregular row of nuclei cell outlines are usually indistinct running downward and backward from the anterior median point and becoming lost as it continues posteriorly.
This row which has arisen from the anterior trochoblasts derivatives of the middle and tip cells of the anterior arm and probably tip cell derivatives of the lateral arms will be designated V Below this band of cells another irregular row may be distinguished composed entirely of second quartet cells which have lain nearest the first quartet area and this row the first appearance of which is indicated in figs.
97 and 98 will be designated V since it corresponds in general to the same cells in Crepidula which are designated by that term.
Unfortunately the cells in this region have for some time presented no distinguishing marks without which exact derivation is precluded by their number but from their positions these lower cells probably correspond to derivatives of 2b2  2 in the anterior group and similar cells in the lateral.
At a later period fig.
101 these rows tend to unite to form an irregular line several cells in breadth distinguishable only by their nuclei.
As the stomodaeal invagination progresses the velar rows are drawn forward and downward in that direction and by the growth of the head vesicle they are also pushed downward laterally.
It is probable that elements of the second quartet which lie still lower than those already mentioned become involved in the preoral velar area either functioning directly as ciliated velar cells or taking part in the development of the underlying region of the expanding velar ridge.
At the period represented in fig.
103 two irregular rows of nuclei may be observed in the anterior cephalic region above the stomodseum and these correspond in origin to the rows V and Vabove mentioned .
The postoral velar area is but faintly demarkatecl in the preparations studied and crosses the ventral region just behind the stomodaeum.
The cells comprising it are doubtless in the median region derived from the third quartet to which are added second quartet elements more laterally where the postoral velum joins the preoral.
A portion of the velum does not in Fiona curve sharply toward the apical pole as in the case of Crepidula where an anterior branch is formed but the whole extends backward around the head vesicle so that this part corresponds in position to the posterior branch of Crepidula.
This difference will be evident if a comparison is made between figs.
78 and 82 of Crepidula and fig.
108 of Fiona.
In the latter instance it will be seen that the apical pole lies far forward from the posterior ends of the velar edge while in Crepidula the anterior branch curves inward toward the apex while the posterior branch continues backward around the whole head vesicle as does the entire velum of Fiona.
In Crepidula Conklin Supplementary Note p. 204 finds that the median anterior portion of the first velar row V probably arises from the divided tip cells of the anterior arm while laterally this row is continued by the trochoblasts and cells at the ends of the lateral arms.
The second row in its midventral region is probably derived from the cell identified provisionally as 2b which lies just beyond the median cells of the first row and he adds I have not been able to determine whether any part of the second velar row arises by yihdivision of cells of the first if not this row may include a few of the third quartet 3a and 3b fig.
56 at the points opposite the anterior turrets.
It also seems probable Supplementary Note page 204 that the cells 2b 2b' lie outside the first velar row.
Fig.
79 shows two large cells between the first and second velar rows and they appear to represent the major portion of these cells.
Smaller derivatives from them may join 2b in forming the median part of the second velar row V.
Conklin thus finds that the preoral velum arises from  a few cells of the first quartet many of the second and possibly a few of the third.
I do not believe that the third quartet becomes involved in the preoral portion of the velum of Fiona though doubtless cells from this series are closely connected with it in the stomodseal region and help in the formation of the postoral velum.
It will be remembered that in Crepidula secondary mesoblast is derived from the second quartet while in Fiona it is furnished by the anterior groups of the third and in this process the large cells of this series wliich have hitherto lain well up on the sides of the gastrula migrate over the underIjdng mesoblastic elements and thus become far removed from the region where the Aelum first appears.
The formation of secondary mesoderm in the most anterior second quartet group of Crepidula has doubtless the same effect of lessening the external area of the quartet in that region while the neighboring third quartet cells would lie relatively higher in this form than in Fiona.
So when the second velar row forms in Crepidula it will lie relatively lower in the second quartet group 2b and more probably involve third quartet cells as Conklin states it probably does.
Regarding the lineage of the velum of Planorhis Holmes says that the tip cell of the anterior arm divides as far as I can determine but once and the two daughter cells become pushed apart by the cell Ib' which forms the median cell of the upper row.
These cells extend to the anterior trochoblasts on either side but in later stages they may sometimes be separated from them by cells which wedge in from below.
The anterior trochoblasts follow these cells posteriorly but Holmes states that the tip cells of the lateral arms do not form a part of the prototroch but enter into the formation of the head vesicle.
In this Planorhis differs from Fiona.
Blochmann states that the right and left tip cells enter the velum of Neritina.
The lower cells in the prototroch Holmes derives from the second quartet though he adds that at a later period cells are joined to the prototroch from below the lineage of which is obscure.
In Ischnochiton the larva of which is in its velar aspects remarkably like the trochophore of Annelids Heath finds that the prototroch is composed of trochoblasts of ''accessory trochoblasts derived from the original basal cells of the molluscan or intermediate girdle cells of the annelidan cross of the tip cells in the anterior and lateral arms while in the posterior arm the tip cells go into the ventral plate the gap in the trochal ring being there bridged by derivatives of the median cell of that arm of the cross.
Thus in this annelidlike form of larva none but derivatives of 2a 2b and 2c from the second quartet form the trochal ring.
The prototroch of Trochus Robert is composed of twentyfive cells sixteen of which comprise the trochoblasts six represent the divided tip cells of A B and C quadrants while the other three are the cells 2a b c A very exact and close comparison may here be made with the prototroch of the Annelids Awphitrite  Arenicola and Clymenella particularly with the former for as Robert says Vingtdeux ont indetiquement la meme origine et la meme disposition que celles de Amphitrite le trois autres 2a b and c sont des derives des cellules correspondantes de la meme Annelide.'
Among Annehds Wilson has found that the prototroch of Nereis arises entirely from twelve of the sixteen primary trochoblasts there being no contribution from the second quartet.
All sixteen of the primary trochoblasts enter the prototroch of Amphitrite and Clymenella Mead as is also the case with Arenicola Child and Podarke Treadwell.
Regarding the close resemblance between the trochophore of Ischnochiton and those of the Annehds Heath says The origin development and fate of these cells primary trochoblasts is precisely similar to the primary trochoblasts in Ischnochiton.
The second quartet in Amphitrite Clymenella and Arenicola furnishes three cells in each quadrant except the posterior which enter the prototroch.
Two of the three are homologues of the divided tip in Ischnochiton while the third corresponds to a posttrochal cell.
If now we compare the derivation and ultimate structure of the annelidan prototroch with the typical molluscan velum some interesting causal relations appear.
At the time of its functional activity the prototroch of Annelids is apparently a radially symmetrical structure.
Among the Mollusks we find as a rule a velum strongly developed anteriorly with a considerable area of weakly ciliated ectoderm between the ends of its posterior arms.
There are numerous exceptions to this typical molluscan velum Ischnochiton and Trochus for examples in which the trochal ring is as complete as among the Annelids.
Returning now to the developmental history of the two groups certain variations are found Avhich when viewed in the light of functional larval structure appear as a natural result of the divergent forms of the larvae these variations having been precociously thrown backward upon the cleaving cells of the ovum.
In Aynphitrite Arenicola and Clymenella among the Annelids and Ischnochiton and Trochus representing the more primitive Mollusks all the primary trochoblasts la 22  222 etc.
in all cuadrants go into the prototroch while in Nereis the same occurs with the exception of four which ma' for all four quadrants be designated la these are not functional in this manner but are pushed inward and form part of the cephalic vesicle.
In Crepidula only the anterior trochoblasts help form the preoral velum lar la' Ib Ib' and the same is true of Planorbis and possibly also of Fiona.
Accessory trochoblasts lazi la2 jj form a part of the prototroch of Ischnochiton in all quadrants while in Podarke the cells la222 lb222 10222 corresponding to three of the above series aid in the formation of the prototroch ''secondary trochoblasts of Treadwell.
In Planorbis Holmes finds that the cell lb2ii jg jg anterior median cell of the prototroch but does not find similar conditions in any other quadrants.
None of these elements which are of course derivatives of the annelidan outer intermediate or molluscan middle cells with the exception of 13'2 of Planorbis which comes from the inner basal are found in the anterolateral .portion of the prototroch of Amphitrite Arenicola Clymenella and Nereis.
In all the above forms except Nereis elements from the second ciuartet are also added to the prototroch and these may be designated with Treadwell tertiary trochoblasts.
In Amphitrite.
Arenicola and Clymenella the prototroch is increased in A B and C quadrants by the cells 2a' 2a2 2a2i pc j Podarke 2a2 and 2a'2i  A quadrant and similar cells in B and C function in like manner while Ischnochiton shows the same for 2a 2a2 etc. enter the prototroch from the anterior and lateral quadrants secondary trochoblasts of Heath.
Of Hydroides Treadwell says Cells are added from the lower hemisphere.
For the prototroch of Trochus Robert derives the three cells from the second quartet in A B and C quadrants 2a 2a2 2a2in etc..
Coming to those Mollusks which possess a typical veliger more cells are found to be contributed by the second quartet particularly in the anterior quadrants.
In Crepidula the tip cells of the anterior and lateral arms go into the first velar row while below numerous cells arc 21 added so that the second row contains  probably a few cells of the first many of the second and possibly a few of the third quartet.
The velum of Planorbis is rudimentary in structure but shows the same general type of development as Crepidula and here in like manner second quartet cells are added.
The tip cells of the lateral arms according to Holmes do not enter the prototroch but cells of the same series below them function in this manner.
In the anterior region loth tip cells and those lying beneath them from the second cuartet enter into the prototroch.
From this short comparison of the lineage of the trochal area in Annelids and Mollusks it will be seen that as in the functional larval form the typical molluscan velum shows greater anterior development than the prototroch of Annelids so also cells taken from the segmented egg to complete the velum in this region exceed in number those destined to form a similar area of the anzielidan trochophore.
To do this the second quartet has become greatly encroached upon in furnishing necessary building material for this structure in those Mollusks whose larvae show strong anterior velar development and in Crepidula the third quartet also possibly becomes involved.
It is natural to conclude as indeed the facts show that those Mollusks which in the structure of their larval prototrochs show great similarity to the homologous structure of the Annelid trochophore will exhibit a similar lineage of the cells constituting the larval organs compared  examples Ischnochiton and Trochus.
Later Velar Development.
 With continued invagination of the stomodseum and constriction of the foot the velar area which has thus far been marked only by an irregular double row of cells extending around the anterior half of the head vesicle and losing itself in the posterior portion of that larval organ becomes more prominent and takes on the bilobed outline so characteristic of the anterior end of veliger larvae.
At first the velar lobes are merely rounded swellings gradually rising from the upper sides of the head vesicle and curving around downward and inward toward the stomodaeum fig.
105.
The cells in this region do not as yet exhibit that differentiation which later marks the prominent ciliated margin from the undei'lying region.
But as the lobes begin to constrict beneath and become more prominent fig.
106 those cells which lie on their most peripheral surface show marked increase in size and the ciliation which hitherto has been uniform and weakly developed becomes more prominent in these cells.
Thev may now be observed lying in a row on the rounded edge of the expanding ridge and though at first this series of cells is indistinctly marked it continues to increase in definiteness and in the size of its component elements.
Figs.
106 107 and 108 PI.
XXXV show successive stages in the elaboration of these large heavily ciliated cells of the velar edge and sections as figs.
91 and 92 PL XXXII in particular show the great increase in size which now marks them.
Coincidently occurs the expansion of the velar lobes to form the broad wings or velar folds which characterize the functional larva at the time it becomes freeswimming.
As the velar area expands it becomes deeply notched below where the lobes of the opposite side rise to meet over the mouth and this growth in length and breadth is marked on the dorsal side as well.
Figs.
109 and 110' side and dorsal views of the same veliger show the condition of development of the velum just before the larva breaks from the egg capsule though in these drawings from fixed material the velum is of necessity considerably contracted.
In fig.
110 it will also be noted that the region just above the mouth has grown out into a projecting process and it is upon this area that the former apical point animal pole lies.
Head Vesicle.
The Head Vesicle of Fiona reaches its greatest prominence at a stage shown in fig.
104 and slightly older larvae.
Somewhat later figs.
105 106 it becomes actually larger but relatively smaller when compared with the larva as a whole and has also become greatly involved in the formation of the velar lobes.
It is composed of cells of the first quartet lying within the trochoblasts and ends of the arms of the cross and its greatest extent is covered by cells which he posterior to the lateral arms.
A posterior cell plate such as is found in Crepidula is not here developed for though doubtless the same cells are present they have multiplied to a much greater extent than in Crepidula or Planorbis and form a layer of small cells which are scarcely distinguishable from those in front or at their sides.
Neither is an apical cell plate demarkated in the region corresponding to the location of that structure in Crepidula the cells in front of the apex being all of similar size and seemingly without regularity of arrangement so that it is with the greatest difficulty that the apex can be located among the large number of small cells of equal size by which it is surrounded.
As has been described before the point of greatest forward extension lies first in the region of the tip of the anterior arm of the cross but ith continued growth the apical area becomes pushed forward so that it shortly occupies the point of greatest anterior extension while the tip region of the anterior arm through which the velum runs lies ventral to the apex in the direction of the blastopore figs.
95 98.
At the same time the head end becomes rounded by increased growth of the cephalic area.
The four original apical cells as shown in figs.
75 and 76 divide soon after and again at a stage represented by fig.
95 so that this region which in Crepidula is in the fully developed veliger still marked by four apicals la etc.
 here comes to consist of at least twelve very small cells among which no regularity of arrangement is sufficient
 marked to be of value in orientation.
These cells are extremely difficult to distinguish from numerous other cells of like form and structme which cover the anterior surface of the head vesicle.
The apical group continues its forard migration in relation to the larva as a whole and as it appears pushes aside some of the cells which have arisen from divisions of the inner and outer basals of the anterior arm for at a later period fig.
108 the apical group lies close against the first velar row.
Either such a shifting occurs or the basals become involved in the development of the velum.
In fig.
108 a row of cells may be distinctly observed in which the nuclei are particularly large extending laterally from the apical point.
My first thought on seeing them was that they were a part of the velum but after definitely locating the position of the apex and following the later history of the velum it is clearly seen that this row never enters into the latter structure but represents in its celllineage derivatives of cells of the lateral arms of the cross.
No ciliation has been discovered in the apical area and such structures are certainly not strongly marked though without examining living material a denial of the possible presence of such structures would scarcely be conclusive.
Nerve and Sense Organs.
Cerebral Ganglia.
 The cerebral ganglia arise at a stage about corresponding to fig.
105 though they do not become well marked until somewhat later fig.
108.
During this period cells may be seen proliferating inward from the ectoderm of the head vesicle in the two regions which lie lateral from the apical area.
A row of cells with large nuclei are at this time plainly visible running laterally from the apex and it is along the anterior side of these cells that the ganglia first arise.
This row has been identified as coming from the lateral arms of the cross and cells lying between it and the anterior portion of the first velar row are from the same source.
Later many of these large cells also divide and go into the ganglia.
Thus it will be seen that the two cerebral ganglia arise from elements of the two lateral arms the anterior rosettes and probably also from some cells of the anterior arm which have been pushed laterally by the advance of the apex and lie in the region where the gangUa develop.
The tip cells of the lateral arms certainly do not take part in the formation of the ganglia as they he too far laterally and probably go into the velum.
Where no large cells the definite lineage of which is known are left as landmarks it is obviously impossible to give absolute derivatives for the ganghonic rudiments.
Comparing however the above approximate derivation with other MoUusks which have been studied in this connection similarities are evident.
In Crepidula the ganglia very probably arise from the lateral extensions of the anterior arms.
Holmes has been able to state very definitely the manner of origin of these gangHa in Planorbis as here they are smTOunded by conspicuous cells.
He says ''The tip cells of the lateral arms and the cells lying immediately above them do not enter into the formation of these masses with the exception of these two cells in each arm all the cells in the lateral arms of the cross the cells of the anterior arm except the tip and basal cell and the central region of the cross except the four apicals and the two cells lying in front of them enter into the formation of these rudiments.
Otocysts and Pedal Ganglia.
 The otocysts appear at a considerably earlier period than the ganglia which innervate them or the cerebral ganglia.
They are first seen as slight invaginations on the sides of the foot slightly below the stomodaeal invagination and at a stage shon in figs.
103 and 104 have developed to deep pits the openings of which have become much constricted.
As these constrictions narrow the two otic vesicles arise and are connected with the external ectoderm by strands of cells which resulted from the constriction of the outer portion of the invaginations.
Somewhat later the pedal ganglia are seen slightly external to the otocysts in position.
These ganglia arise in part from the strands wliich connected the otocysts with the ectoderm and in part from other cells proliferated from the ectoderm in the same region.
At first the cerebral gangha are not connected with each other by a commissure nor with the pedal ganglia but later cells grow out and meeting connect the cerebral ganglia together while between cerebral and pedal ganglia like connectives arise probably both ganglia contributing cells to their formation.
These connectives are very large fig.
94 and the whole cephahc nervous system is much concentrated.
Behind the pedal ganglia and somewhat higher dorsally may be distinguished particularly in older larvae the rudiments of the pleural ganglia which also appear to have arisen by delamination of the ectoderm and lie in close association with cerebral and pedal ganglia.
A very heavy commissural strand connects the two pedal ganglia and the whole nervous system of the larva foreshadows in its compact structure the adult condition individual gangha being difficult to distinguish.
Figs.
92 and 94 show sections through this region at a somewhat later period than figs.
88 and 89.
Eyes have not developed to a functional condition in the oldest larvae observed.
Sections of these show pigment granules within cells lying close to the cerebral ganglia and in some cases these cells lie around a slight invagination of the ectoderm  the first evidence of optic organs.
Excretory Organs.
The large excretory cell which lies on the right side of the larva and forms the chief member of a group of similar greatly vacuolated cells lying in that region arises from the third quartet in the C quadrant and from its large size and conspicuous appearance its complete history is known.
Returning to a segmentation stage in which the egg contains about one hundred and twenty cells fig.
70 it will be seen that the third quartet group in C quadrant contains seven cells.
Divisions next occur in the three large cells 3c 3cand 3c fig.
77.
The cell 3c does not divide with these nor does it ever again divide but continues its growth soon becoming the largest element in the ectoderm.
As gastrulation proceeds this large cell 3c Ex.
 the origin of which is thus established appears at the right of the elongating gastrula left of figs.
78 79 and with the closure of the blastopore lies midway between dorsal and ventral surfaces as shown in figs.
98 and 99.
It has become much larger when compared with its neighboring cells both from lack of division and by actual growth.
As the veliger takes form this cell becomes yet more marked fig.
102 and when the shell gland has become prominent fig.
104 it is seen lying in a sHght depression surrounded by small cells which are in an active state of division.
As the foot arises and the cephalic end of the veliger is differentiated from the body the large excretory cells move upward along the body just posterior to the pedal groove on the right side this change of position being a natural sequence of the general torsion of that region figs.
105 106.
The intestine has also become well developed by this time as a solid strand of cells connecting the posterior end of the enteric cavity with the ectoderm and this latter point of contact is just below the large excretory cell.
Fig.
88 shows a section through this region showing the excretory cell to be much vacuolated and to lie for the most part below the ectoderm.
At a considerably later stage figs.
109 110 its position and structure are shown just before the vehger escapes from the egg capsule.
A large nucleus which usually contains several small nucleoli and having the general appearance of nuclei in cells which have for a long time remained undivided lies at the lower end of the cell.
The cytoplasm is greatly vacuolated and at its peripheral end where it meets the exterior is seen a deep pit with constricted mouth.
This appears to function as an intracellular duct for it comes into connection at its inner end with the large vacuoles which fill the cell.
Just above and anterior to the large cell is a group of smaller ones which contain darkly stained nuclei and pigment granules.
One of these the largest also contains vacuoles and lies nearest the cell 3c.
In somewhat older larvse one or two of these smaller cells which lie close to 3c have increased much in size JDecome greatly vacuolated and appear to function as their larger neighboring cell.
These smaller accessory excretory cells are also doubtless of ectodermal origin and since they lie between the principal one and the blastopore are doubtless derived from the same quartet.
Inaddition to the excretory cells above described others of a similar nature are found in the larva of Fiona.
Sections figs.
90 91 of fairly welldeveloped veligers show two cells Nph nearly symmetrically placed on the two sides of the body just behind the constriction separating head from body region.
These cells contain large nuclei and their protoplasm is clear and greatly vacuolated.
In a shghtly older stage the oldest larva examined yellowishbrown granules are very evident lying in the meshwork of the vacuolated cytoplasm.
The cell on the left side fig.
91 lies just to the side of and slightly higher than the otocyst of that side being closely associated with its ganglia while the one on the right side fig.
90 lies higher and is in close proximity to the smallest cells of the large excretory organ of that side.
It may be distinguished from the cells of this organ by its clear cytoplasm and the color of the granules lying in it.
In later stages another cell of similar nature may be seen beside the one on the right side but only one has been observed on the left.
The origin of these cells is not known.
In earlier stages cells of shghtly smaller size lie in the regions which they later occupy but cannot be distinguished in structure from neighboring mesodermal elements.
However they lie close to the ectoderm and may have come from that source.
The later fate of these cells is unknown but as they are increasing in size they probably function as important larval oroans.
They will here be designated nephrocysts for they correspond to cells of similar position and structure described by Trinchese ISSl for the larva of Ercolania and other Nudilranchs.
by whom an excretory function was ascribed them.
Older and living material is desirable before making definite statements regarding the nature and function of these apparently similar larval organs of Fiona.
Numerous investigators have seen and described with various interpretations the excretory organs of larval Opisthobranchs.
As early as 1839 Loven observed the anal kidney in Xudibranch larvae but did not recognize its function though indicating that it was probably an undeveloped sexual organ.
Likewise Sars 1840 described a similar structure in the veliger of Tritonia which together with the large endodermal cell which lies near it he associated in common function with the liver ldng on the opposite side of the enteron.
In olis Hke structures were found.
Later 1845 he distinguished the vacuolated excretory cell and its neighboring pigmented cells classing the whole as a reproductive anlage.
Reid 1846 observed a like structure in a number of Nudibranchs Doris Pohjcera Doto etc.
 considering it to be probably the heart from contractions which he saw it imdergo.
In Vogt's very thorough paper on Actceon appearing in 1846 the excretory organ is somewhat neglected though his figures indicate its presence.
Nordman in the same jear described this organ in Tergipes and referred a reproductive significance to it.
Schneider 1858 also found it in Phyllirhoe.
iDut assigned no definite fimction.
Langerhans 1873 having observed in the living larvae of Doris and Acera cells in the anal region which contained concretions and from which drops were extruded considered the organ to be of an excretory nature.
In 1875 Lankester found similar conditions in Aplysia and considered the organ to have arisen either from intestinal cells near which it lay or from the ectoderm.
Trinchese ISSl described an ''anal gland for Ercolania wdiich is strongly pigmented and Hes on the right side of the body.
This he believed arises from three or four mesodermal cells which acquire pigment and by their division form the organ in question.
The same was found in Amphorina Bergia and Doto in the last case being paired.
In addition to the anal excretory organ Trinchese also found in the above forms two rini primive in the dorsal region under the ectoderm one right and the other left.
These he described as vesicular spherical or ovoid bodies having a lower part full of transparent liquid in which lay concretions of a yellowish color.
These he denominated 'nephrocisti nephrocysts and ascribed to them a mesodermal oridn since they have no connection with the exterior.
Haddon 1882 found a mass of cells on the right side of Jantheria and Philine near the anus in Elijsia on the left side and in Pleurobranchidium on both sides.
In 1888 Rho found similar organs in Chromodoris which he stated arise from a few mesoderm cells containing numerous concretions and excreta which indicate their functional value.
He concluded that this structure corresponds to the right Prosobranch kidney considering the left to be rudimentary.
LacazeDuthiers and Pruvot 1887 in a paper on Opisthobranch embryology described the anal organ of Aplijsia Philine Bulla Pleurobranchus Doris and members of the family olidida stating that in origin it is entirely ectodermal and that it was none other than an  anal eye.
This eye it was claimed becomes strongly developed in the blind larva and later atrophies as true eyes appear.
It stands in connection with a cellmass ganghonic in nature the asymmetrical centrum of LacazeDuthiers.
Mazzarein 1892 came to some very different conclusions from work on Aplysia.
He beUeves the organ in question to have neither the structure nor function of an eye and moreover it remains present in the larvae after eyes are developed.
From its position and structure it is doubtless a kidney.
He derives it from paired rudiments which originally were closely associated with the endodermal elements of the al3oral pole mesentodermal cells and which later separating wander into the blastocoel cavity and after torsion begins first the left and then the right come to lie in the neighborhood of the anus and together form a small cavity which acquires communication with the exterior.
This unpaired kidney is homologous to the kidney niere which in many Prosobranchs is found in the same place and as is well known forms the anlage of the definitive kidney.
Mazzarelli therefore concludes that the anal kidney of the Opisthobranch larva is a secondary kidney secondare niere while the primitive kidney of these MoUusks is already known the nephrocisti of Trinchese.
The anal kidney is but the anlage of the definitive kidney which in this case corresponds not to the right but to the left adult kidney of the Prosobranch.
Heymons 1893 has carefully described the conditions found m Umhrella.
The excretory rudiment is here at first paired and arises from the cells 3cS 3d which sink somewhat below the surface and divide several times one cell in each group remaining large.
Thus the excretory cells of Umbrella are ectodermal in origin.
In further history Heymons finds that the large cell of the left side decreases in prominence and finally is indistinguishable from those surrounding it while the right continues to enlarge and with the torsion of the larva is carried higher on that side.
Later a second large cell appears by the side of this one which Heymons thinks cannot represent the original left cell as this would presuppose too great a migration but rather one of those associated with the original right the growth of which has been delayed.
The function of a larval excretory organ is assigned only to this group of cells by Heymons.
In 1895 Mazzarelli after a study of the development of a large number of forms Philijie Gastropteron Actceon Oscanius Pleurohranchus Tethys Archidoris Aplysia Hermcea Janus Polycera and Haminea came to the conclusion that the anal organ of Loven Sars Pruvot LacazeDuthiers and others was not as LacazeDuthiers Pruvot and Heymons maintained of ectodermal origin but rather mesodermal arising from two large and other smaller mesoderm cells which become pigmented and which by a slight ectodermal invagination accuire an external opening.
In later development he finds these cells form a connection with the pericardium which has arisen from a mesodermal mass closely connected with them.
Therefore he concludes that the anal kidney of the Opisthobranch larva is not homologous with the head kidney of the Prosobranchs but from its origin position and relation particularly in connection with the pericardium it is none other than the anlage of the definitive kidney of the adult And also since it lies to the left of the rectum it corresponds to the kidney of the Gastropods which possess but one and to the left kidney of those with two.
Viguier 1898 describes the anal kidney of Tethys distinguishing an excretory lumen around which are grouped several cells he does not indicate its origin.
Among the Prosobranchs externally situated larval excretory organs appear to have been found generally.
Salenskj 1872 has described such bodies filled with concretions lying upon the side of the body in CalyptrcBa and Nassa.
Bobretzky 1877 found the same in Fusus these cells lying behind the velum and without an underlying ectodermal layer.
This latter condition is placed in doubt by McMurrich 1886.
Similar organs to the above were found in Fissurella by Boutan 1885 while in Capulus v. Erlanger 1893 a single large ectodermal cell probably excretory in function was found on each side of the body behind the velum.
For Crepidula Conklin 1897 has minutely described a group of ectodermal cells lying laterally just behind the velum and probably arising from the second quartet they become much vacuolated filled with darkly stained granules and before metamorphosis separate from the ectoderm and are lost.
Erlanger 1892 concluded that the larval kidney of Bythinia was partly ectodermal and partly mesodermal and had no connection with the definitive kidney of the adult.
The earlier results of Blitschli 1877 on Paludina as well as Bythinia were enlarged by Erlanger 18912 showing that in these freshwater Prosobranchs the larval kidney was formed from inner mesodermal and outer ectodermal portions.
Rabl 1879 established a mesodermal origin for the primitive kidney of Planorbis and Holmes 1900 in his late work confirms the same.
Fol 1879 derived the larval kidney of Planorbis entirely from the ectoderm.
Wolfson 1880 described the larval kidney of Limnaa as arising from a large velar cell on either side which migrates inward retaining connection with the exterior through an intracellular duct.
Meissenheimer 1898 says of Limax we have in der urniere ein rein ektodermales Gebilde vor uns zu dem das lesoderm auch nicht den geringsten Beitrag geliefert hat.
From his figures and discussion it appears very evident that in this form the primitive kidney is purely ectodermal in origin.
In 1899 Meissenheimer published his investigations on the Urniere der Pulmonaten of the Basommatophora Ancylus Physa Planorbis Limncea and of the Stylommatophora Succinea Helix Avion Limax.
In both these groups he shows the larval kidney to be entirely ectodermal in origin and similar in structure the urinary tube of the latter group being manycelled while in the former but four cells comprise it.
In both a ciliated cell or cells closes the inner end of the tube and for this reason Meissenheimer compares the primitive kidney of the Pulmonate with the end cells of the water vascular system of the Platyhelminthes.
Among the Lamellibranchs Hatschek 1880 describes the larval kidney of Teredo as probably both ectoand mesodermal in origin.
In the single left primitive kidney of Cyclas Stauffacher 1897 found a similar though more complicated structure arising from Ijoth ectodermal and mesodermal elements.
Meissenheimer 1901 finds that in Dreissensia polymorpha the larval kidneys arise from ectodermal cells wholly each of the two being formed from a few inwandering cells. '
The structure is more simple than that of the Pulmonates and Meissenheimer suggests that it may be the ground type of the group.
This might then be described as an ectodermal invaginating tube with the end closed by a vacuolated heavily cihated cell.
From the above account of some of the more important observations and conclusions upon the nature and origin of the larval excretory organs of the Lamellibranchs and Gastropods and of the latter more jjarticLilarly of the Opisthobranchs one is strongly impressed with the feeling that much more work must be done upon these organs of mulluscan larvse before we are ready to come to definite conclusions regarding their mutual relations and homologies if such exist.
Nor has the investigation recorded in this paper brought forward facts which justify an immediate solution of the problem.
The anal kidney of Fiona doubtless corresponds to the similar structure described for so many members of the Opisthobranchia Ijut its derivation is totally different from the results obtained by some of the more recent and careful workers in this group.
Mazzarelli's conclusions regarding its mesodermal origin resulting from investigations upon a large number of closely related forms are very different from mine.
There is no point regarding the cytogeny of Fiona of which I am more certain than that the group of cells constituting the anal kidney is of ectodermal origin and one member of the group the largest 3c has been traced through every step of its history from the initial cleavages which produce it to its fimctional condition upon the right side of the veliger larva at the time of hatching.
In this respect my results are entireh in accord with those of Heymons for Umbrella and except for the function assigned to the resulting organ agree closely with LacazeDuthiers and Pruvot's derivation of the same structure from ectodermal cells.
With regard to the fate of this organ the work of Rho and Mazzarelli appears to show conclusively that it becomes metamorphosed into the kidney of the adult and the latter's comparison of this organ with the adult kidney of those Gastropods which possess but one or with the left of those with two is in entire accord with the generally accepted opinion upon this subject.
Unfortunately material has not been available for a study of the metamorphosis of Fiona.
But on a priori grounds it should be similar in all essential features to the abovementioned processes of development in closely allied forms.
The metamorphosis of the anal kidney of the larval Opisthobranch into the definitive kidney of the adult might seem at first sight fair grounds on which to doubt its ectodermal origin since the latter structure has generally been considered to be a mesodermal derivative.
But if in this connection be considered the recent results of Meissenheimer who derives the adult kidney and allied structures of Limax and Dreissensia representing two distinct molluscan groups from ectodermal rudiments after an investigation which bears every evidence of care and accuracy the possibility at least of a similar manner of formation among the Opisthobranchs must be granted.
So little is as yet known of the Nephrocysts of Trinchese that any discussion of their significance and possible homologies must of necessity be largely hypothetical.
An exact knowledge of their derivation and structure would be of the utmost value.
In Fiona when first seen they lie in the cleavage cavity but whether they have wandered there from the ectoderm or are from the first mesodermal in character is yet an imsolved problem.
Should they prove to be of ectodermal origin their position might justify a close homology with the Prosobranch larval kidney and possibly also with those of the Pulmonates and Lamellibranchs since Meissenheimer has indicated the larval kidneys of the two latter groups to be of ectodermal origin and his work is supported bj' the earlier investigations of Wolf son and Fol.
Should these nephrocysts prove entirely mesodermal there is yet a possibility of their similarity to the larval kidneys of the Prosobranchs Lamellibranchs and Pulmonates through the investigations of Biitschli and Erlanger for the Prosobranchs Rabl and Holmes for the Pulmonates and Hatschek for the Lamellibranchs who derived the primitive kidney of members of these groups in part or entirely from mesodermal elements.
However the structure of the nephrocj'sts of Opisthobranchs is very different from the primitive renal organs of the groups above cited for as far as is known they appear wholly enclosed in the schizocoel with no external ducts.
The fact of their very rudimentary structure suggests an explanation for the great development reached by the anal kidney.
When we consider that in other groups possessing true larval excretory organs the anlage of the definitive kidney does not develop into a condition of functional activity until after metamorphosis while among Opisthobranch larvae even before the time of hatching certain cells of this structure are actively concerned in the work of excretion the causal relation between rudimentary structures on the one hand and advanced development on the other is brought forcibly to mind.
The nephrocyst of the Opisthobranch is not a prominent or welldeveloped structure and with its phylogenetic decline precocious development has arisen in the rudiment of the definitive kidney resulting in functional activity in a part at least of its formative elements long before development of the adult organ.
There is yet another possille explanation of the renal organs as found in Opisthobranch larvse which will be stated but briefly since a preponderance of hypothesis over fact is always to be regretted.
It is generally conceded that whether the anal kidney be of mesodermal or ectodermal origin its rudiment is at first a paired structure one part of which may fail to develop into a renal organ Heymons or unite with the other Mazzarelli.
The nephrocysts are paired structures one lying close to the anal kidney the other in an almost similar position on the opposite side of the body.
It is possible that the nephrocyst of the right side is but a part of the anal kidney of that side while that of the left represents the degenerate whole of the rudiment of that side.
In this case of course true larval kidneys would be wanting.
The Enteron.
As the archenteron arises from the cleaving cntoblast it presents when viewed from the vegetative pole an irregular depression the bottom of which lies considerably below the edge of the blastopore.
The macromeres 5 A 5B 5C and 4D are at the bottom of this pit with 5a 5b and 5c lying peripherally from them while above these and next to the ectoblast come 4c' 4b 4a2 and the smaller cells 4c 4b and 4a In the posterior region are found the small cells E E e e enteroblasts which have arisen from 4d.
The fifth quartet and all the macromeres are the next cells to divide this resulting in enlargement of the wall area of the enteron and by this division into smaller elements closer contact between the blastomeres results.
Hitherto the entoblasts have been much rounded except those meeting directly in the center and have lain together in a very irregular manner particularly after invagination began.
With diminution in size and rearrangement of these cells a distinct cavity with closed dorsal wall arises fig.
SO.
At the anterior end lies the large cell 4b2 while posteriorly and laterally are found the two large cells 40 4c between and behind them are the enteroblasts.
At first the enteron is longer on the right side left of figures the cell 4c lying more posterior than 4a this being the natural result of the division which early separated the large mesentomere from 4D of that side and the lack of growth and division in this latter cell for so long a period.
But as development proceeds and the whole enteron grows in anteroposterior extent it will be noted that 4a which is a very large cell and easily distinguishable gains in its backward course upon the opposite cell of like lineage 4c  comes to lie opposite to it and later more posterior figs.
80 81 82.
This process is the beginning of the torsion of the intestine and is apparently to be explained in at least its first manifestations as the direct result of increase in growth of one side over the other.
After Aa
lies considerably more posterior than the derivatives of the large cell which before lay opposite it 4c 4c fig.
81.
the cell h is seen to be midivided as yet and still at the anterior median point of the enteron showing that the change of position of 4crelative to its opposite cell has been the resiUt of greater increase in the area of the left over that of the right enteric wall.
During this process 4ahas not been observed to divide and it maintains its large size throughout.
On the opposite side Ac has divided into cells of eciual size and divisions are continued in this region resulting in the thinning of that portion of the enteric wall and an equalization of the size of the cells which compose it.
With the continued growth of the enteron 4ais moved still more posteriorly and finally toward the right left of figs.
82 83.
In fig.
84 which represents the enteron in optical section at a stage about corresponding to fig.
104 4ais seen lying directly in the median fine.
Above in the anterior median portion of the enteron is a group of large yolkladened cells which have been derived from 4b and its neighboring cells.
This group will soon shift somewhat to the left and become the rudiment of the liver.
As was seen before the small cells W E e e which were separated from the anterior end of the mesentoderm at first lie between isx and 4c An actual section at this stage parallel to the ventral surface fig.
85 shows that the inner of these cells are yet in contact with the enteric cavity.
I am confident that the cells in this figure marked ''enteroblasts'' represent mesentoblastic derivatives.
Their history position size and the structure of their nuclei which are small and darkly stained correspond to these cells.
With the increase in extent of the left side of the enteron and after the closure of the blastopore by its continued growth these enteroblasts which may be distinguished from their neighbors by their darkly staining nuclei and their smaller size become pushed from the median plane toward the right side as the large cell 4aadvances around to a more and more posterior position fig.
83.
Finally when 4a2 itself lies on the median line these cells lie entirely to the right and are more posterior than those which have come from 4c and 5c.
A slightly diagonal actual section as fig.
86. shows the large cell 4a in the median plane.
Just behind it and slightly to the right are shown in the section five small cells lying closely pressed between 4a2 and the shellgland invagination behind.
These cells correspond in position and in appearance to the small enteroblasts of fig.
85.
If we now examine section fig.
87 which is taken through a vehger shghtly older than that shown in fig.
104 the relation of the enteron to its surrounding structures may be olserved.
The large entodermic cell 4a has been successively traced through preceding stages from its origin on the left side of the archenteron to its final position on the right of the enteric cavity as is shown in the figure.
Just posterior to this will be noted a mass of cells connecting the enteron with the ectoderm.
The nuclei of these cells are compact and deeply staining and the cytoplasm is decidedly clearer and contains less yolk than that of the cells directly surrounding the enteric cavity.
Moreover their position beside the large cell 4aand now through the torsion which the enteron has undergone their later position somewhat posterior to this cell indicates the probability of their correspondence with the enteroblasts of fig.
86 PI.
XXXI and earlier stages in which the identity of these cells is unquestioned.
It is proper in this place to consider again the results of Carazzi's work on Aplysia and its relation to the mesentodermal history of Fiona.
It will be remembered that Carazzi's account of the hneage of 4d up to a stage w'hen its derivatives number twelve cells exactly parallels my results on Fiona but regarding the fate of these cells there is lack of agreement.
The anterior small cells of Aplysia are believed to be purely mesoblastic.
while at least four of them in Fio7ia appear from the preceding account to be entodermal in nature.
Carazzi however derives endoderm from the two small posteriorly directed cells e e of Aplysia which correspond to z.
zof Fiona.
These latter cells were last seen lying at the posterior end of the gastrula of Fiona closely pressed against the ectoderm.
At a later period when a large number of mesodermal elements lie in this region the z 7
cells become indistinguishable from these.
Sections of later stages fig.
87 show two cells which are larger and clearer than the enteroblasts and which he against the ectoderm where the intestinal mass touches it.
They may represent the cells z z but of this there is no evidence except that given above.
Anal cells are not a marked feature of the developing embryo of Fiona but at this time sections in particular show two cells of somewhat larger size than the smrounding ectodermal elements against which the forming intestine abuts and which are doubtless comparable to the anal cells of other forms fig.
87 An.C.
It will now be seen that the portion of the enteron lying most posterior and close against the shellgland invagination has been derived from the cells which formed the bottom and the left side of the original archenteric invagination oB ob 4C 5C 5c 4D 5A while dorsally and anteriorly are seen more yolkladened elements whose origin may be traced to the large entoderm cell 4band those around it.
The stomodaeal invagination breaks through at a much later period between the descendants of 5a and 4b and their neighboring cells which have been turned in an anterior direction while doubtless cells from 4c and 5b also push in upon this region with the closure of the blastopore.
By the torsion which the enteron has undergone the upper mass of large yolkladened cells is moved more and more to the left while in like manner 4aturns to the right.
While this is occurring the invaginating sliellgland has pushed the anterior and posterior walls of the enteron very closely together both enteric and cleavage cavities being practically obliterated fig.
86.
When this structure evaginates the enteron again opens out and has then lost its elongated form being rounded with its wall cells in close contact fig.
87.
In Umbrella as well as in Fiona 4b' occupies the anterior end of the enteric mass pushing up into the pointed apex of the gastrula and the same is true of Aplysia in which there are but two large blastomeres though according to Blochmann's nomenclature such does not appear to be the case.
In later stages the positions of the large cells of the fourth quartet of Umbrella and Fiona are identical.
The intestine of Umbrella is said to be formed by C and D 5c and 5d which as Heymons did not take into consideration an entoblastic contribution from 4d correspond fairly well to the conditions foimd in Fiona where these cells lie just at the place of origin of the intestine and may well take part in its future development.
The celllineage of the archenteron of Crepidula is given as follows The four macromeres form the roof of the archenteric cavity.
The cells of the fifth quartet form its lateral boundaries arching the cavity on all sides save the posterior.
Here the archenteric cavity runs backward between the cells 5C and 5D 5c and 5d nearly to the posterior boundary of the egg.
The cells of the fourth quartet come together on the ventral side of the archenteron forming its floor anteriorly and ultimately giving rise to some of the many small cells which form that part of the mesenteron adjoining the stomodseum.
The intestine arises from the posterior lower right region of the enteron as a tubelike evagination formed from the enteroblasts derived from 4d and neighboring small endodermal cells and ending blindly against the ectoderm.
Later it elongates and the end is carried somewhat upward along the right side by trosion of the larva.
It contains a lumen from the first.
As the stomach begins to enlarge it is seen to be bounded by large cells dorsally and anteriorly in its lower 25 regions.
As development proceeds it is elongated its posterior end being ventrally directed and turned toward the right.
The development of the liver of Crepidula comes later being retarded by the great amoimt of yolk.
The next change in the development of the enteron of Fiona may be observed in fig.
105 which represents a veliger in which the alimentary canal is beginning to become differentiated into several parts.
Anteriorly is seen the stomodseiim which has as yet not broken through but touches the wall of the enteron.
Above and to the left of this point of contact is a decided lobing of the wall of the enteric cavity formed of the large yolkladened cells which at an earlier period lay in the anterior region of the archenteron.
This is the rudiment of the liver and as development proceeds the invagination becomes larger and more constricted at its base forming a rounded lobe upon the left dorsal wall of the enteric canal.
Behind the rudiment of the liver the enteron has widened into a capacious sac which is larger at its upper anterior end the walls of the whole being formed of rather small cells which are yet rich in yolk.
This is the stomach and it ends blindly against the intestinal mass behind and to the right.
The intestine is yet a solid strand of cells connecting the posterior end of the stomach with the ectoderm.
With the growth of the veliger this strand has become more slender elongated and turned forward its distal end lying well up on the side of the body behind the constriction which forms the foot.
The huge excretory cell lies just dorsal to this point figs.
106 107.
In figs.
90 91 92 and 93 which represent coronal sections of a veliger somewhat older than figs.
105 and 106 and shghtly more mature than that of fig.
107 it will be seen that the intestine is still a solid strand of cells and that the oesophagus is as yet not in open connection with the rest of the alimentary canal.
An examination of a considerably older larva figs.
109 110 shows a very small lumen just beginning to form in the center of the intestinal strand but as yet no communication between oesophagus and enteric cavity.
Stomodceum and Mouth.
As the blastopore narrows fig.
79 it becomes entirely surrounded except at the anterior end by third quartet cells.
At the anterior point second quartet cells from 2b and 2b lie along the edge also.
Figures of a later stage as 97 98 show the blastopore as a mere rounded opening its edges and walls below thickly set with darkly nucleated cells and when complete closure occurs a plug of these cells may be observed upon lateral optical section dipping down from the region of closure to the enteron beneath.
These cells have come largely from the third quartet of all four quadrants and represent the smaller cells of this quartet which lay nearest the open blastopore.
This condition exists but for a short time for soon a broad pit may be observed in this region occupying exactly the place where the blastopore closed.
As it forms the cells which have been invaginated to form the blastoporeplug open out again so that a blind pit results the lower surface of which is formed by those cells which were first pushed inward as the blastopore was closing and correspond to the second and third Cuartet elements which are shown in fig.
79 surrounding the blastopore.
The stomodseal invagination continues to increase in depth by growth and division of the cells which already form it and by further invagination of surrounding cells so that as the form of the veliger begins to appear figs.
103 104 105 106 second and third quartet cells from all the quadrants lying in the region probably become involved.
 At first the stomodseum is broad and shallow but as it increases in depth it narrows and becomes more dorsally directed at its inner end.
In section fig.
90 and in drawings of the oldest veliger shown figs.
109 110 the stomodseal invagination has as yet not formed an open connection with the enteron but shortly afterward this occurs at which time the stomodseum is much elongated.
Union is established with the stomach pouch just below the opening of the large liver lobe.
Fiona agrees with a large number of JMollusks in which the blastopore closes and the stomodseum forms at the same point.
Among them may be named Nassa Bobretzky Neritina and Aplysia Blochmann Elysia Vogt various Eolididse Trinchese Doris Langerhans Crepidula Conklin Planorbis Holmes and Trochus Robert.
In Patella Patten Fusus Bobretzky Pteropods and Heteropods Fol and Limnwa Lankester the blastopore is said to remain open and pass over directly into the mouth.
Shellgland and Foot.
If one examines the segmenting egg somewhat later than such a stage as shown in fig.
73 it will be observed that the posterior has considerably outstripped the anterior region in extent and that together with numerous divisions the cells have also enlarged considerably in size.
The area which lies along the median line and so is derived from the second quartet shows most plainly this rapid increase in extent and it is here particularly that the cells themselves become greatly enlarged and prominent.
This is the region of posterior growth and from this area arise both the shellgland and the foot.
Taking up first the history of the former of these two organs it will be found that in a stage represented by figs.
95 and 98 the whole area between the blastopore and the end of the posterior arm of the cross shows karyokinetic activity but particularly in the region marked Sh.G.
the cells have increased considerably in size.
As growth continues these cells upon the upper and posterior surface of the gastrula protrude above the level of the ectoderm the area which they cover having the appearance of a rough cobblestone pavement but somewhat later they settle down and form a smooth surface.
The center of this area which now lies just opposite the region of the stomodseum begins to invaginate pushing the enteron before it and reducing its cavity so that there results a deep pit which growing in size below constricts above and around which are several rows of large granular cells fig.
102.
Such a condition lasts but a short time for soon the invaginated area opens outward the whole forming a large thickwalled cap upon the posterior end of the veliger constricted around its edge and merging abruptly with the thinwalled ectoderm anterior to it fig.
104.
As growth proceeds the shellgland spreads and becomes much thinner while the larval shell appears as a secretion of the large cells which compose it.
As the shell continues to extend over the veliger its outer edge is marked by several rows of large cells which by their secretive activity lay down the substance which forms the shell figs.
105 106 107.
Almost from its origin as a distinct structure the shellgland is slightly displaced to the left side of the body and as it increases in extent this lack of bilateral symmetry becomes more marked fig.
107.
The ventral prominence wliich develops into the foot arises somewhat later than the shellgland and the cells which go into it come from the second quartet of D quadrant and the third quartet of C and D quadrants.
The large ectodermal excretory cell which in the lara lies just behind the foot serves as a guide to show that much of the foot like this cell arises from C quadrant of the third quartet and though no such landmark is present on the other side the early history of the two quadrants are so similar that we may reasonably suppose a like origin from the third quartet for the left side of the foot.
Lillie has derived the foot of Unio from cells of the second quartet and Conklin appears to have done the same for Crepidula.
Holmes states for Planorbis that as the cells immediately behind the blastopore are of third quartet origin probably the median portion of the anterior end of the foot is derived from some of these cells.
Robert describes a similar condition for Trochus.
In Fiona not only the median portion but also much of the lateral area certainly comes from the third quartet.
The foot here does not arise as a paired swelling as in Patella Patten Fulgar McIurrich and Trochus Robert but shows from the first a median protuberance which increases in size and later becomes broadened and flattened figs.
103 108 110.
Its upper surface is covered with numerous cells but they are not arranged to form a conspicuous cellplate as in Crepidula.
Large cells mark its lower surface and they soon begin to secrete the operculum.
Larval Musculature.
It is particularly unfortunate that for a study of the muscles of the velum no living material has been available as without this many points of interest must of necessity be lost.
When the veliger breaks from its capsule it presents an appearance shown in figs.
109 110 though it should be remembered that in fixed material from which the drawings were made the muscles must be much contracted.
The whole posterior region is swollen into a huge transparent vesicle at the anterior end of which lies the contorted alimentary canal.
In dotted outline is represented the probable position of the cuticularlike shell before shrinkage.
In a larva of such age one of the most characteristic features is a large dorsal retractor muscle which has its posterior point of attachment well to the left of the dorsal side of the posterior vesicle.
It runs forward and branches just before reaching the liver lobe its two anterior ends becoming attached to the ahmentary canal and the body wall in the region of the oesophagus.
In structure it is composed of large spindleshaped interlacing cells which are flattened dorsoventrally giving the muscle a bandlike form.
In fmiction this muscle doubtless acts as a retractor for the anterior and particularly the upper portion of the cephalic region.
A dorsal view of the same veliger shows two lateral muscles the right and left retractors of the foot which arise about midway back on the sides of the posterior vesicle and extend forward through the lower part of the neck region to end in branching fibers in the foot.
That of the right side is larger than the left and in earher stages figs.
105 106 is much thicker than later and relatively larger.
In figs.
105 and 106 is showoi a small muscle Vl.R.
extending from the dorsal neck region to the velar folds where it branches greatly.
Other similar retractor muscles of the velar lobes extend from the walls of the alimentarv canal and the bodv wall outward into the velar area branching extensiveh'.
Fine interlacing fibers are also found in the foot in older stages.
Returning to the period marked by fig.
105 the dorsal retractor muscle is seen to be a short thick strand of cells extending from the shell region to the enteron near the position of the liver.
It is here already branched and runs along the sides of the alimentary canal.
The right retractor of the foot is as shown a very heavy cell strand which miites the foot with the lower dorsolateral portion of the shell.
A view from the left side would show a muscle occupying a similar position but in this case much thinner fig.
107 shows their relative sizes at a slightly later stage.
Even at this early period the dorsal retractor is posteriorly.
attached to the left of the median line.
Bearing in mind the distinction of Lillie and others between primary mesoblast entomesoblast and secondary mesoblast ectomesoblast or larval mesoblast the attempt has been made to distinguish between these two sources of muscular tissue in the developing larva of Fiona with however but partial success.
The velar retractors which lie in the region of the head vesicle are formed from secondary mesoblast.
Those cells which we have seen cut off from the third cuartet in the two anterior quadrants lie in the anterolateral region of the gastrula and may for some time be distinguished from the primary mesoblast cells.
When at an early period spindleshaped muscle fibers appear in this region their origin from these cells can scarcely be doubted.
The component elements of the dorsal retractor are hard to distinguish.
When this muscle first appears at a stage about midway between figs.
104 and 105 several large cells lie wedged in between the rounded wall of the enteron and the ectodermal area in the upper region of the shellgland.
The evidence is strong that these cells at least are from the primary mesoblasts.
At this time however other cells extend along the enteron connecting the compact posterior group with the loosely lying spindleshaped elements of the velar retractors.
They doubtless help form the more anterior portion of the dorsal retractor and lying as they do so close to where secondary mesoblast was formed m.ay be derivatives of it.
The two retractors of the foot and the interlacing fibers of that organ itself are doubtless composed of cells which have come from 4d.
From the above account it is seen that a true larval mesoblast is found in Fiona since much at least of the musculature of the velum a purely larval organ is derived from this secondary mesoblast.
No organ in any way comparable to a larval heart is to be found in the oldest veligers which I have studied.
Change of Axis and Form of the Developing Organism The egg at the time of laj'hig is spherical.
Yith the division into four cells the primary egg axis running between the centers of the animal and vegetative poles becomes shorter than the diameter of the equatorial plane.
As segmentation proceeds this relation persists fig.
14 and with continued division the formation of a large cleavage cavity becomes more pronounced.
Until the cleaving egg reaches a stage of over sixty cells its surface when viewed from either pole appears almost perfectly rounded but shortly after this its anteroposterior axis becomes shorter than the lateral figs.
45 56 74 this relation holding until increased growth in the posterior and anterior quadrants causes elongation in that direction.
Until about a stage shown in fig.
74 the primary egg axis running from the center of the animal to the center of the vegetative pole follows a straight line.
Immediately after this accentuated growth of the posterior region initiates a bending of this axis which finally results in its complete folding upon itself or a rotation through 180 degrees.
A sharply pointed anterior projection arises fig.
78 while at the same time the posterior dorsal region is rapidly increasing in extent and changing the embryonic axis.
As the gastrula elongates the apical pole is moved forward and by the time the first velar row becomes distinct the original polar axis has become so bent upon itself as to form an angle of nearly 90 degrees figs.
95 98.
With the continued multiplication of cells in the head region that portion of the larva changes from its originally pointed shape into a rounded though not prominent head vesicle while at the same time the opposite end is rounded by continued growth of second and third quartet elements figs.
100 101.
The original polar axis wall be seen in these figures to have moved through about 135 degrees.
In the next stage represented by figs.
102 and 104 the head vesicle has reached its largest relative size when taken in connection with the veliger as a whole.
Comparing these figures with those which have gone before a marked increase will be seen in the anteroposterior depth and if this be considered in connection ith the great change of axis the enormous growth of the posterior region will be evident.
It is generally conceded that the head vesicle of molluscan and annelidan larvse is of functional importance in serving as a float.
In Fiona the head vesicle is never large and prominent and a substitute may reasonably be expected.
With the differentiation of the velar lobes and foot the shellgland may in figs.
105 106 and 107 be seen to be rapidly spreading over the posterior region.
As this is being accomphshed it also grows greatly in size producing the enormous posterior vesicle which in figs.
109 and 110 extends far behind the internal organs of the body.
The importance of such an organ must be considerable and taken in connection with the early decrease in size of the head vesicle strongly suggests that its functional value is similar in kind to that usually ascribed to the anterior or head vesicle of other larvse.
In all older veligers figured the original polar axis has become completely bent upon itself a rotation of 180 degrees having occurred.
With regard to the median plane of the future embryo the first cleavage plane is obliquely transverse to this plane.
AVhen the mesoderm is formed it is thrown over toward this median plane and from the first is approximately bilateral in position figs.
24 31 34.
The elements of both entoblast and ectoblast which in late stages of cleavages lie on the median plane appear to be derived from cells of the early cleavages which occupied similar positions.
Little rotation if any is apparent other than a certain amount of irregularity found in all portions of eggs with equal or nearly equal cleavage.
Conklin describes for Crepidula an entire rotation of the ectoblastic cap at the time when the anterior and lateral cells of the fourth quartet arise.
Heymons shows a similar rotation in Umbrella.
Such a change of axis in the germ layers does not occur in Fiona nor is there necessity for it.
The large macromeres of Crepidula and Umbrella are here represented by small cells which do not modify the positions of the germ la3ers at the time of their origin nor necessitate supplementary rearrangement.
Abstract.
Maturation begins at the time of laying.
Two polar bodies are given off the first of which may or may not divide.
The unsegmented egg of Fiona is rich in yolk the spherules being comparatively small.
In shape the egg is round but shghtty flattened in the direction of its polar axis.
One to three eggs are found in a roomy egg capsule.
The early cleavage is strictly spiral after the dextral sequence.
The first quartet of micromeres are much smaller than the macromeres but with succeeding divisions the cleavage becomes equal in character.
After the four macromeres are formed they give rise to successive quartets of micromeres.
The first three quartets contain all the ectoblast.
The mesoblast arises in part from the fourth quartet cell of D quadrant.
The remaining fourth quartet cells and all the macromeres are entoblastic as is also the case with a small portion of 4d.
The first quartet of ectomeres give rise to the trochoblasts and ectoblastic cross.
To the latter structure are added as tips the upper cells of the second quartet m all quadrants.
The cross is radiallyspiral in symmetry and does not increase in breadth by transverse sphtting of its arms until a comparatively late period.
Cells from the fust quartet form the head vesicle cerebral ganglia and eyes and a portion of the first velar row.
The second quartet has a similar cleavage history in all four quadrants until a stage of about 150 cells.
In later development the elements of this quartet in D posterior quadrant show great increase in size and divisional activity initiating the posterior point of growth with resulting bending of the embryonic axis.
Cells from this area form the shellgland and median portion of the foot.
A large number of second quartet cells from the anterior and lateral groups aid in the formation of the velum.
The more ventral elements of B quadrant help to close the blastopore.
In the third quartet bilateral cleavages first appear in the posterior quadrants cells 3c and 3d.
Secondary mesoblasts arise from the anterior quadrant groups of this quartet cells 3aS 3a and 3b 3b.
The large anal excretory cell 3c and its associated cells are derived from C quadrant of this quartet.
Third quartet cells surround the blastopore as it closes with the exception of a small anterior portion much of the stomodseum and the lateral portions of the foot come from third quartet elements.
The mesoblast of Fiona is derived from two sources entomesoblast from 4d and ectomesoblast from the third quartet in A and B quadrants.
The greater amount comes from 4d and forms teloblastic bands in the posterior region of the gastrula.
The secondary mesoblast ectomesoblast is largely larval in fate since much of it goes to form the muscles of the velum.
From the history of 4d it appears that this cell contains both mesoblastic and entoblastic derivatives the latter taking part in the formation of the intestine.
As is the case with many Opisthobranchs the gastrula is sharply pointed anteriorly the apical point at first lying at the end of the anterior arm of the cross.
The blastopore at the time of closure is surrounded by third quartet cells except at its anterior edge where second quartet cells are present.
The stomodceum later forms at the point where the blastopore closed.
The shellgland at first forms a deep invagination which later opens out and covers the posterior end of the veliger with a cap of large cells which soon begin to secrete the shell.
From the first the shell is slightly shifted toward the left and this asymmetry becomes more marked with continued growth.
With the enlargement of the shell a conspicuous posterior vesicle results.
The foot arises as an unpaired swelling below the stomodceum.
Its under surface later secretes an operculum.
The first velar row is formed from the anterior trochoblasts A and B quadrants the tips of the anterior arm of the cross and possibly from other cells of the first quartet in this region.
The second velar row is derived from underlying cells of the second quartet.
A postoral velar area is but slightly marked.
In later development the velum becomes bilobed and broadly expanded.
A prominent head vesicle is not present in the older vehgers and with this may be correlated the development of a large posterior vesicle.
No apical senseorgan has been found nor are distinctly marked apical plates present.
The cerebral gangha appear in the angles between the anterior and lateral arms of the cross.
Otocysts are formed by invaginations of the ectoderm upon the sides of the foot and pedal gangha appear closely associated with them.
The eyes are late in appearing and are intimately connected with the rudiments of the cerebral ganglia.
The anal kidney of the larva is derived from the ectoderm coming from 3c and associated cells.
With the torsion of the larva this group is shifted farther to the right and eventually lies well up on the right side of the veliger above the anal opening.
Primitive excretory cells are also found lying in the body cavity laterally behind the velum.
The enteron is formed by invagination of the entomeres which at first form an elongated sac with the evagination of the shellgland this becomes rounded.
The hver is derived from large yolkladened cells lying at the anterior end of the enteron and later the rudiment of this organ becomes turned toward the left side.
Torsion of the enteron results from lengthening of the left side and is caused by increased growth of that region.
The intestine is at first a solid thick cellstrand and is composed largely of entoblasts from 4d it later elongates and acquires a lumen.
