MOLLUSCA OF FLINT AND CAROLINE ISLANDS IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND EDWARD G. VANATTA.
The species recorded below were collected by Mr. C. D. Voy a Californian naturalist in the year 1875 in the course of a voyage from Honolulu through Polynesia to Sydney New Soutn Wales Australia.
Somewhat extensive series of mollusks Crustacea and echinoderms were also taken in the Marquesas Society Islands Rurutu Island of the Austral group etc.
These collections were acquired by the late Prof. E. D. Cope and remained unopened in the original parcels until presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1901 by Mrs. Annie P. Cope.
Most of the island groups represented in Yoy's collection have been more or less exploited by other naturalists particularly Garrett Pease and the Godeffroy brothers but so far as we know no mollusks have been reported from Caroline and Flint Islands.
Although the collection from these places is not extensive we have thought it worth while on this account to put the facts on record.
The only land animals taken on the two islands were the widely distributed Birgus latro and Truncatella valida.
Flint Island lies 11 25' 43 S. 151 48' W. and Caroline Island is 10 S. 150 14' 30 W. They are small isolated uninhabited islets lying north of the Society group in the central Pacific.

293 Liotia voyi n. sp.
Shell obliquely trochiform convexly conic above flattened below.
White.
Nucleus lost 3 whorls remaining separated by a deep suture which is regularly bridged across by thin lamellae dividing it into a series of pits which at the last whorl penetrate through to the umbilicus.
The last whorl is convex above with two low obscurely double spiral cords which are somewhat nodose at their intersections with rounded radial ribs.
At the periphery two thin ecjual keels project the space between bridged across by thin lamellge which are continuations of the radial ribs the keels rising into spines at the ' it.  lamellae.
The base is slightly convex roughened by two JR7 circles of tubercles lamellosetuberculate at the edge of the umbilicus.
A large spiral cord revolves within the umbilicus near its lower termination it has a tooth beyond which it is continuous with the basal lip.
The aperture is oblique circular the outer lip being expanded in a scalloped varix with five shallow pits on its face.

This large and beautifully sculptured Liotia is related to L. crenata Kiener. Compared with specimens of that species in the collection of the Academy L. voyi is larger and more roughly sculptured and it wholly lacks the minute sculpture of fine even strise in the intervals and pits of the coarser sculpture which is characteristic of Kiener's species.
The septa between the peripheral keels are straight in L. voyi but strongly curved in L. crenata.
L. crenata was very imperfectly described by Kiener and his dimensions are entirely wrong.
It is doubtful whether Reeve's figure copied by Tryon represents the true crenata which is we think rather rare.
