CRUSTACEA FROM THE NORTHERN COAST OF YUCATAN THE HARBOR OF VERA CRUZ THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA AND THE BERMUDA ISLANDS.
BY J. E. IVES.
The Crustacea treated of in this paper were collected for the greater part on the northern coast of Yucatan and in the harbor of Vera Cruz during the early months of 1890 by the Expedition in charge of Professor Augelo Heilprin sent by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Pliiladelphia to investigate the Natural History of Yucatan and Mexico.
The writer who was a member of the Expedition is indebted to Professor Heilprin for the opportunity of working up this portion of the collection.
The paper also includes a list of the Crustacea collected upon the west coast of Florida in the spring of 1886 by Professor Heilprin and Mr. Joseph Willcox under the auspices of the Wagner Free Institute of Science of Philadelphia' and the description of a new Iso
od collected by the Academy's Expedition to the Bermuda Islands in 1888.
It is remarkable that the shores of Yucatan and Mexico portions of the American Continent among the first to be discovered by Europeans should be among the last to have their zoology investigated.
Nothing whatever with one or two isolated exceptions has been known hitherto of the fauna of the shores of Yucatan and very little of that of the eastern coast of Mexico.
The material collected by the Expedition has added considerably to the knowledge of this region.
The carcinological results may be briefly summarized as follows.
Five new species and one new variety are described and figured a species described by Say from the coast of New Jersey and two described by Dana from Rio Janeiro and not referred to since their original description have been redescribed and one of them figured  other little known and unfigured species have been figured  and some interesting conclusions have been arrived at in regard to the synonymy of some of the species and the geographical distribution of the Crustacea of the Caribbean region.

In reference to the character of the coasts upon which the specimens were collected in Yucatan and Mexico the following paragraphs are quoted from the author's report upon the Echinodernis collected by the Expedition.'
 The northern coast of Yucatan possesses a sandy beach largely made up of shell fragments.
The water off the coast is very shallow the 10 fathom line being 20 miles from the shore and the 100 fathom line about 150 miles.
Three miles off the shore in the neighborhood of Progreso tlie bottom is of a sandy character although a few small corals were brought up in the dredge.
Along the shore to the westward of Progreso is a small Serpuloid reef.
Large quantities of seaweed and sponges are thrown upon the beach and lie decomposing in the sun.
These and numerous waterworn specimens of Orhicella anwilaris and a large Escharine species of Bryozoan with some specimens of Xiphogorgia anceps indicate the existence of a region rich in animal and vegetable life not very far from the shore.
The harbor of Vera Cruz is an area of luxuriant coral growth madrepores and brain corals being especially abundant.
The specimens from the west coast of Florida were collected in the shallow waters of that region from Cedar Keys to the Caloosahatchie River.
The sliore line consists of sandy or shelly beaches and mud flats.
The 10 and 100 fathom lines are about the same distance from the coast as in the case of northern Yucatan.
While engaged in working upon the Brachyura discussed in the following pages the author came to the conclusion that it would be advantageous to carcinologists to have a special term for the four jiosterior pairs of appendages of crabs now known as the ambulatory legs.
The term cruriped' a word of similar construction to cheliped has therefore been introduced.
It was found that confusion often arose in the use of the term legs it being used indiscriminately either for the four posterior pairs of appendages alone or for all five pairs.
The term  ambulatory leg used by Mr. Miers and others is cumbersome and may be well replaced by c.ruriped.
In the following pages therefore the term chelipeds is used for the anterior pair of appendages of Brachyura cruripeds for the four posterior pairs of appendages and legs when speaking of all five pairs.

Professor Dana de.scribed the species from a specimen obtained by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition probably at Rio Janeiro.
It has not since been recorded from any locality and its rediscovery upon the coast of Yucatan is of much interest.
A broad distribution is thus indicated.

Four fiddlercrabs were collected at the Port of Silam which apparently represent an undescribed species.
They consist of three males and one female and agree well in their character.
The species may be described as follows.
Rostrum broad between the orbits.
Male abdomen sevenjointed.
Carapace smooth moderately elevated  posterior edge between the posterior pair of cruripeds threefifths of the length of the anterior edge  anteroposterior diameter about twothirds of the length of the anterior edge.
Margin of the meros of the larger cheliped minutely denticulate inner flat surface smooth outer convex surface with scattered transverse rows of minute tubercles.
Carpus inner surface smooth outer surface minutely tubercled.
Manus long and slender.
In a specimen fifteen mm.
wide between the anterolateral angels of the carapace the manus is thirtyone mm.
long to the tip of the dactylus and nine mm.
wide across the broadest portion of the palm.
The length of the palm is rather less than twofifths and its breadth rather less than threetenths of the entire length of the hand.
The fingers are long and slender the pollex is perfectly straight and the dactylus is narrow at its base between the superior and prehensile borders rather longer than the pollex little arcuate and gently curved toward the tip.
Palm minutely granulated on the outer surface on the inner surface with a row of tubercles running upwards and backwards from the lower margin to the carpal groove and continued upwards and forwards from the carpal groove towards the upper margin.
Proximal portion of the palm behind this groove minutely granulated distal portion smooth.
Pollex and dactylus smooth with three rows of minute tubercles upon their rehensile margins tubercles of the outer and inner rows very minute and closely approximated those of the middle row slightly larger of irregular size and not closely approximated the five at the base of the dactylus being most prominent and increasing in size from the base outwards  one or more tubercles nearly as prominent as these latter in each of the fingers near their middle.
The inner row of the tubercles upon the pollex continued upwards and slightly backwards upon the palm nearly to Its upper margin.
A slight ridge of tubercles in front of it at the base of the dactylus.
The ridge forming the upper border of the carpal groove minutely denticulated and its anterior end not continued downwards and forwards upon the palm.
This form is closely allied to Gelasimtts vocator as characterized by Professor Kingsley.'
It differs from it principally in the length and shape of the larger cheliped.
In Gelashr.us speciosxis the larger cheliped is about twice the length of that of Gelasimus vocator.
The fingers are longer and more slender the dactylus is less arcuate the granulation upon the outer surface of the palm is finer and the ridge forming the upper border of the carpal groove is not continued forwards and downwards upon the palm but is terminated by a slight groove separating it from the upward and forward extension of the tubercular ridge of the lower portion of the inner surface of the palm.
The sides of the carapace are also rounded and less angular than in Gelasimus vocator.
In the long and slender character of the fingers it approximates Gelasimus stenodactylus but is distinguished from this species by the fact that the fourth fifth and sixth segments are distinct from each other and not anchylosed into one piece.
The following species have been described since the monograph of the genus by Professor Kingsley.

Numerous specimens of this widely distributed species were obtained at Progreso and the Port of Silam.
It is u.ed by the fishermen as bait and large numbers are dug from the sand.
Specimens of Hippa are in the collection of the Academy from the eastern and western coasts of the Americas  from California Guatemala Panama and Chili and from Massachusetts New Jersey Florida Brazil and La Plata.
A careful examination of the abundant material leads me to the conclusion that the forms on the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the continent represent but a single species.
The supposed distinctive characters enumerated byStimp.
son and Miers such as the shape width and rugosity of the carapace the shape of the frontal lobes of the antennal spines of the lobe of the thii'd joint of the outer maxillipeds and of the last abdominal segment do not appear to be constant.
Variation in these characters exists in forms from both the Pacific and Atlantic waters and I have not found it possible to fix upon any character by which to distinguish the forms from the two areas.
All the characters mentioned above are more or less variable in the specimens from either side.
The carapace may be broader or narrower more or less rugose the shape of the frontal lobes and of the lobe of the third joint of the outer maxillipeds varies and the antennal spines vary in their length and may be directed slightly inwards or outwards.
The specimens from any one locality however resemble each other and the tendency towards variation expres.ses itself in local varieties.
The specimens from the west coast appear  to be usually more rugose than those from the east coast but it is by no means a constant character.
No good typical figure of this species exists.
That given by Professor Yerrill is the best but the carapace is usually narrower at its anterior extremity than is shown in his figure.
The figure given by H. MilneEdwards in the  Regne Animal' under the name of Hippa emerita Fabr. is much narrower than any specimen of this species which I have seen and its general aspect excites a suspicion that it represents a specimen of Hipa asiatica' and not of Hippa emerita.
Clibanarius formosus n. .ji.
Pluto V. figs.
1 and 2.
Three hermit crabs were collected upon the beach at the Port of Silam which apparently belong to an undescribed species of the prolific genus Clibanarius.
For them I propose the foregoing name.
The species may be characterized as follows   Carapace with the anterior margin angular possessing a small acute median tooth  about fourfifths as broad as long.
Eye peduncles slender about as long as the anterior margin of the carapace their basal scales small with three or four teeth on the anterior margin.
External antennae with the last joint of the peduncle nearly three times as long as the penultimate and with the basal scale of moderate size  its acute extremity reaching the distal edge of the penultimate joint.
Chelipeds small of equal size manus oblongoval covered with numerous tubercles from which arise tufts of short hairs meros joint with a small blacktipped spine at its anterodorsal extremity.
Cruripeds somewhat compressed  tarsus of the first and second pairs slightly longer than the penultimate joint  with several longitudinal series of small pits into which aie inserted tufts of short hairs.
Color in alcohol a dull orange the cruripeds with four broad longitudinal stripes of reddishbrown upon the tarsal and penultimate joints  the stripes situated upon the dorsal lateral and ventral surfaces respectively.
The preceding or fourth joint with two broad stripes upon its outer surface and one upon its dorsal surface.
Length of the carapace 25 mm.
In general characters this species resembles very closely the common form of the southern coast of the Eastern United States 1 Crustaces pi.

A small female squilla about 2 inches in length was collected at the Port of Silam.
It agrees well with Dana's description of Squilla prasinolineata.
It also resembles the figure of SquWa Dufresnii given by Mr. Miers in his Monograph of the Squillidte and I am therefore led to regard this latter species as a synonym of Squilla prasinolijieatu.
The squilla in the collection of the British Museum described and figured by Mr. Miers under the name of Squilla Dufresnii had had the name attached to it in manuscript by Leach but had never been previously described.
White in his List of the specimens of Crustacea in the collection of the British Museum 1847 p. 83 recorded Leach's manuscript name but gave no description.
Dana published his description of S. pr a sino I ineata in 1852 and if as I have assumed these two species are synonymous then Dana's name must be used as no description was attached to the publication of Leach's name in 1847.
The specimen in the collection of the British Museum which Mr. Miers doubtfully refers to Squilla prasitiolineata appears to me in all probability not to belong to it.
He says that the median carinules of the exposed thoracic and first to sixth postabdominal segments are obsolete whereas Dana says only  in part obsolete.
Dana says that the lateral margins of the three exposed segments of the thorax are entire whereas the figure given by Mr. Miers shows that the two posterior segments have a small anterior lobe.
Mr. Miers also says that the median longitudinal carina of the carapace is indistinctly furcate only in its anterior portion whereas Dana states that it is not distinctly furcate near the front but towards the posterior margin opens for a short distance.
Mr. Miers also states that in his specimen the terminal postabdominal segment is proportionally narrower and more elongated than in Squilla Dufresnii but I fail to see any difference in this respect between Mr. Miers' figure of this latter species and Dana's figure of Squilla prasinoUneata.
Mr. Miers' figure shows that the specimen he is describing lias a well developed lateral process to the first exposed thoracic segment whereas the specimen collected in Yucatan only has a small insignificant lateral process such as is shown in his figure of the thoracic segments of Squilla Dufresnii.
Dana's species was described from Rio Janeiro.
Squilla Dufresnii of Miers has no locality.
The species has not since been recorded from any new locality and the finding of it on the coast of Yucatan is therefore very interesting.

ll. Three small specimens of a Cirolana were obtained at the lort of Silam which do not correspond to any described species.
They are distinguished from all other species by the form of the antennae and rejiresent a new species which may be characterized as follows.
Body narrow about three and onethird times as long as broad with the sides nearly straight and arallel smooth and polished with few unctations.
Head subhexagonal about one and three quarter times as broad lis long antennulse rather longer than the breadth of the head anteniise as long as from the interior margin of the head to the posterior margin of the third thoracic segment  sigmoid in shape at its origin bending backwards then bending forwards and then backwards  segments of the flagellum forming the anterior concavity armed anteriorly each with two bundles of numerous bristles one on the upper and other on the lower edge thus forming a brush shaped structure.
First thoracic segment nearly twice as long on the median line as the second  second third and fourth segments equal  fifth and sixth segments rather longer and seventh segment half the length of the sixth.
The epimera of the fourth fifth sixth and seventh segments are produced osteriorly into an angle and those of the .second and third segments are subquadrate all have an impressed line running anteroinferiorly.
Spines and bristles upon the legs are not numerous.
A small portion of the first abdominal segment exposed.
The lateral angles of the abdominal segments acute not rounded.
The telson about twothirds as long as broad minutely crenulate on its posterior border with very short spines inserted in the notches.
The largest of the three specimens from which this description has been drawn is about 9 mm.
in length.
In the smaller specimens the series of bristles upon the antennse are not so well developed.
 .
The most characteristic features of this species are the brushlike arrangemeut of bristles upon the aiitennse and the crenulate posterior border of the telson.

1114 will be found dorsal and lateral views a view of the fourth leg on the right side and of the male sexual organs.
The species has been well described by Say.
The male genital organs upon the middle of the ventral surface of the seventh thoracic segment consist of two spinelike appendages with a broad groove upon the posterior surface.
This form does not come properly within the genus Nse.sa either as defined by Leach' MilneEdwards' or Gerstsecker.'
I have placed it provisionally under Cymodocea believing with Mr. Beddard 1886 p. 145 that the genera Dynamene Ncesa and CiUccea probably represent variations of form of this type sexual or otherwise of no primary importance.
M. Hesse has worked out the sexual dimorphism of several related species inhabiting the coasts of France.

Six scimens all males were collected.
There appears to be a tendency in the four spines within the sinus of the posterior abdominal segment to become double.
The three tubercles upon the first exposed abdominal .segment may also be double.
The largest specimen from Bermuda is 10 mm.
in length.
Associated with these were six specimens of a related form in which the exterior uropoda are short and lamellate.

I have used the specific name given to this species by Linnieus in 1758 and not the designation of macxilatu6 applied to it by Catesby' in 1748.
Most authors have used Catesby's name but as this antedates the tenth edition of the Systema Naturse it should be abandoned in favor of Linnseus' name.
Lamarck in 1801 erected a new genus for the reception of this species with an allied form and gave to the new genus the name of the Liunean species.
This he renamed Grapsus pictus.
I am of opinion however that Linnaeus' specific name should not be abandoned on account of its use generically and I therefore retain it.'

Geographical Distribution.
In the chronological list at the end of this paper will be found the titles of all important monographs dealing with the higher crustacean fauna of the West Indian region.
As this list represents a summary of our knowledge of the region I will merely mention here briefly the most important contributions to the subject.
In 1817 Thomas Say who might aptly be termed the Father of American Invertebrate Zoology published in the first volume of the Journal of this Academy a series of papers entitled An Account of the Crustacea of the United States.
These papers contain descriptions of a number of new species principally from the Southern coasts of the Eastern United States.
The species are nearly all characteristic forms of Florida or the West Indies and his papers may therefore be regarded as the first contrilution to our knowledge of this fsiuna.
In 1850 Gibbes in a paper on the carcinological collections of the United States described a number of new forms the greater part of them being from the same region as those described by Mr. Say.
In 1852 Dana published his historical monograph on the Crustacea collected by the United States Exploring Expedition in which the species collected at Rio Janeiro are enumerated and many new ones from that locality described.
In 1858 H. DE Saussure described a number of new species from the coast of Mexico and the West Indies and in the following year Dr. Stimpson published the first of three papers continued in the years 1860 and 1871 in the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of Xew York in which he described many new species from the region opened up by Say and Gibbes.
M. A. Schram in 1876 published a manuscript by Dr. Isis Desbonne enumerating the Crustacea of Guadeloupe and describing some new species.
In the following year Heller in his report upon the Crustacea collected by the Novara Expedition gave a list of species obtained at Rio Janeiro with descriptions of some new species.
In 1869 Professor S. I. Smith published a notice of the Crustacea collected by Professor C. F. Hartt on the Coast of Brazil 1867 which contains a list of species collected and descriptions of new species and also a list of all the species of Crustacea known upon that coast at that date.
In the same year Dr. Ed.
V. Martens published a description of some fresh and brackish water Crustacea from Southern Brazil collected by Dr. ReintzHensel.
In 1870 Dr. Stimpson published his preliminary report upon the Crustacea dredged in the Straits of Florida by L. F. de Pourtales of the United States Coast Survey.
In 1872 appeared a paper by Dr. Ed.
V. Martens on the Crustacea of Cuba.
Five years later Mr. E. J. Miers described several new species from Cayenne and in 1879 Professor KingsEEY published his list of Decapod Crustacea found at Fort Macon N. C. In the same year he also published a paper upon a collection of Crustacea from Virginia North Carolina and Florida.
During the years 18731880 appeared the report of Prof. A MilneEdwakds upon the Crustacea collected by the Mi.ssion Scientifique au Mexique.
Professor MilneEdwards originally intended to make his report a complete monograph of the Carcinological fauna of both sides of Central America but owing to the destruction of nearly the entire collection of the Commission during the bombardent of Paris he was unable to do this.
The report although imperfect as a complete monograph is an excellent work.
The greater part of the Brachyurous Crustacea of these waters are described and illustrated by very fine figures.
In 1881 Prof. MilneEdwards published his Preliminary report upon the decapod Crustacea dredged in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea by the United States coast survey steamer  Blake  during the years 1877 1878 and 1879.
In this report many interesting deep sea types are described.
In 1887 Prof. C. L. Herrick published an extensive paper entitled  Contributions to the Fauna of the Gulf of Mexico and the South.
The subject of the paper is a collection of Crustacea made in Mobile Bay.
A number of new and little known species are described and figured.
The paper on account of its comprehensiveness and numerous illustrations should be a very vaJuable addition to the literature of the subject.
I am sorry to state however that although I have had occasion to make very little use of it my slight acquaintance with it has not left a very favorable impression upon my mind.
In the figure of Paloemonetes vulgaris PI.
V fig.
7 there has been drawn one thoracic leg too many six legs instead of five and in the figure of Peneeus setiferus on the same plate fig.
0 there are three instead of two teeth upon the frontal and hepatic regions.
In the latter case the third tooth that has been drawu does not exist in any member of the genus.
As the species figured is a common one there can be no doubt that the figure is intended to represent this species but if it were correct the existence of a third spine would probably be sufficient to make a new genus of it.
In addition to the papers that have been enumerated should be mentioned the several monographs on the different grouS of Crustacea collected by the Challenger Expedition including species from the Bermudas St. Thomas and Bahia.
It will be apparent from the preceding resume of the literature of the Crustacea of the West Indian region that although much is known of the subject our knowledge is as yet by no means complete Much remains to be learned of the Crustacean fauna of the Eastern coast of South America.
Several collections of Crustacea have been made at Rio Janeiro but we do not know with certainty how far south of this point the Caribbean Crustacea extend.
North of Rio Janeiro Professor Hartt collected at the Abrolhos Reefs and at a few points on the East coast of Brazil.
Of the fauna of the Northeastern coast of Brazil and of the Northern coast of South America and the Eastern coast of Central America we have only very scattered knowledge.
Even of the Gulf of Mexico itself our information is very limited.
Northward from Florida to Cape Hatteras the coast is much better known.
From Cape Hatteras to New Jersey is still nearly a terra incognita.
The only contribution to our knowledge of this latter portion of the coast is a scanty list of Crustacea collected by Mr. P. R. Uhler in Chesapeake Bay.
Of the Crustacea of the West Indian Islands much remains to be known.
We have a fair knowledge of the fauna of Cuba and Guadeloupe and a very limited knowledge of that of Hayti St. Thomas and St. Martin.
The Crustacea of the Bermuda Islands are known from the Academy's Expedition to these Islands in 1888.
Dr. Isis Desbonne has described many species peculiar to Guadeloupe and we may reasonably look for species peculiar to some of the other unstudied West Indian Islands.
The lists of Crustacea collected in various regions are usually of much less value than they might be from the fact that they do not give any particulars in regard to the specimens collected.
It should always be stated in such lists whether the specimens occur in abundance or are rare.
In some cases also young specimens are found during the summeiwhich have developed from hirvse.
brought to these shores by warm curreuts and which perish during the winter.
Such species certainly cannot be regarded as normally inhabiting these shores.
This occurs on the coasts of Southern New Jersey where during the summer numerous specimens of Ocypoda arenaria both in the IMegalops stage and in the very young adult stage can be collected on the beach.
No large adult specimens are found.
iV'ejajnis frirarMiis also occasionally obtained on the coast but this species on account of the rarity of its occurrence can only be regarded as an occasional visitor and not as an inhabitant.
It is probably brought north by the warm currents from the south.
Mr. S. I. Smith has treated of this subject and records the occurrence of young secimens of five southern species of Decapods upon the shores of Long Island and of Vineyard.
Sound.
Besides these he records two southern species brought in on whalers and three pelagic species characteristic of the Gulf stream which have been stranded upon the Northern coasts.
These facts should therefore be carefully considered and when an area of distribution is defined for a given species it should only include those localities in which the species is constantly found in greater or less abundance.
Mr. S. I. Smith in the Crustacea of the Atlantic Coast of North America north of Cape Cod has exemplified this method and his paper is consequently of great value.
Besides entering carefully into the range of the species he has also given the deith of .water which they inhabit.

The comparative iange.s of these species may be graphically illustrated by the following table.
The horizontal line opposite the name of a species represents its longitudinal distribution along the Eastern coast of the American continent.
Where species have been recorded as occurring at distant points such as Yucatan and Rio Janeiro these localities have been connected by a line passing through the intervening region.s although the species may not as yet have been recorded from these regions as it is probable in all the cases in which this has been done that the species occur there.

The preceding table suggests the division of the Caribbean province into two subprovinces which may be termed respectively the Carribbean and the Brazilian.
The Caribbean extending southwards from Cape Hatteras to Central America including the West Indian Islands and the Brazilian extending from Central America to Rio Janeiro.
A consideration of what is known of the distribution of the Crustacea of the entire Cai'ibbean province has also led me to adopt this view.
By far the greater number of the species enumerated by Rathbun from Brazil are peculiar to that coast and the same can be said of the species enumerated by Kingsley from the Carolinian and Floridian shores.
The fauna of the latter region is undoubtedly very closely related to the West Indian proper of which indeed it may be regarded as a part.
Professor Dana as early as the year 1852 in his monograph of the Crustacea collected by the United States Exploring Expedition discussed the question of the geographical distribution of the Crustacea in a way that has laid all future marine zoologists under a debt of gratitude to him.
He showed very clearly the important part that the temperature of the water plays in the distribution of marine littoral species.
The chart of the world prepared by him showing the isocrymes or lines of greatest cold affords the key to many a perplexing problem.
He divides the region which I have termed the Caribbean into four Provinces the Caribbean including the West Indian Islands the Eastern coast of Central America and the Northern and Northeastern coast of South America from the region of the Mississippi River to beyond Bahia  the Floridian Province including Key West and the Southern extremity of Florida together with the Bermudas the Brazilian Province including Rio Janeiro and extending north nearly to Bahia  and the Carolinian Province including Northern Florida Georgia and the Carolinas as far north as Cape Hatteras.
It appears to me however that these four provinces should be merged into a single province the Caribbean which may be subdivided into two subprovinces the Caribbean and Brazilian as outlined above.
It is I think impossible to separate the Carolinian Floridian and Caribbean provinces of Dana.
Our knowledge of the species inhabiting these regions has increased greatly since the publication of his work and the range of the species is known to be greater than he supposed.
The extension of the Floridian fauna northwards to Cape Hatteras is probably owing to the fact that the shores of Flor14 ida Georgia and the Carolinas as far north as Cape Hatteras are bathed by an overflow of the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.
The Arctic Labrador current coming from the North along the Eastern coast of the United States according to Commander Bartlett  does not extend south of Cape Hatteras but at that point goes under the Gulf Stream eastwards.
North of Cape Hatteras the Gulf Stream is deflected northeastwards and is more or less separated from the coast by the cold Labrador current.
On the Northern coast of Yucatan as evideueed by the collection of the Mexican Expedition the Brazilian and Caribbean subprovinces to a certain extent overlap.
There appears therefore to be two centres of distribution in the Caribbean region a Floridian and a Brazilian giving rise to the two provinces which overlap in Central America.
Professor Dana in his classical work enumerates eight species common to the warm waters of both sides of the American Continent and Professor Kingsley in his paper upon the genus Alpheus mentions 15 additional species.
Professor Dana also pointed out the fact that the genera of the east and west coasts are largely characteristic of the region embraced by these two coasts and that a large proportion are common to both shores.
He distinguished the region represented by these coasts as the Occidental Kingdom.
He was unable however to account for this relationship of the eastern and western coasts as at that time there did not appear to be any evidence of the recent submersion of any part of Central America.
It is now well known however that during the Tertiary period a connection must have existed between the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific.
This connection will explain the existence of species common to both shores.
The Cretaceous rocks of Mexico and the Tertiary deposits of Yucatan discovered by the Academy's Mexican Expedition together with the recognized Cretaceous and Tertiary deposits of northern South America further point to a time when there was a free intermingling of the waters of the Atlantic and of the Pacific.
The close relationship of the two faunas as evidenced by the large proportion of genera common to the eastern and 1 Report of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey 1882 p. 37.

The separation of North and South America also probably explains the well marked division of the continental portion of the West Indian region into a Brazilian and Caribbean subprovince.
The peculiar distribution of Limulus polyphemus is worthy of note.
It breeds north of Cape Cod and extends at least as far south as Yucatan.
It apparently does not extend as far south as Bahia but it may be found to occur on the South American coast between that point and Yucatan.
So far as is yet known it is characteristic of the Eastern coast of North America.
The presence of closely related species in the Moluccas and on the coast of Japan suggests as pointed out by Prof. H. MilneEdwards a former connection of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
This may have been that even of the Cretaceous as the genus appears to have undergone little modification since an early geological period.
The presence of members of this genus in the Triassic Jurassic Cretaceous and Oligocene beds of Europe and Syria render it also possible that both the American and Asiatic species may have had as their original center of distribution the Mesozoic and Ceuozoic seas of Europe the one migrating westwards and the other eastwards and that neither species has been derived from the other but both from a common European ancestor.
The author having previously been engaged in working up the Echinoderms collected by the Academy's Expedition to Mexico a comparison of the distribution of the Echinoderms and Crustacea oil the two sides of the continent in the tropical and subtropical regions naturally suggests itself to the mind.
Among the Echinoderms no species are known with absolute certainty to be common to both coasts  if there are any they are undoubtedly very few in number while in the Crustacea as stated above there are supposed to be twentythree species common to the two areas.
Professor Verrill however has pointed out that notwithstanding the absence of identical species of Echinoderms there is a very close relation between the faunas of the two coasts.
A large proportion of the genera are represented on both sides.
The fauna of the Pacific coast is also very distinct from the IndoPacific fauna.
The absence of identical species of Echinoderms upon both coasts and their presence 1 Crust.

The general similarity on the other hand of the Echinodeinns inhabiting both shores points to an earlier period as in the Crustacea when there was uninterrupted communication between the two areas.
The present distinct specific and to a certain extent generic character of the two faunas point to a subsequent complete separation of the two regions.
This again must have been partially obliterated allowing a slight intermingling of the active forms of the two areas.
As stated above from the geological researches conducted by the Mexican Expedition and other explorations in Central and South America it is now known that Mexico and more or less of Central and northern South America were submerged during the Cretaceous period and it is probable that there existed during this period a tropical and subtropical American littoral fauna undifferentiated into Eastern and Western regions.
During the succeeding Tertiary period Central America were elevated forming a complete bari'ier between the two oceans during this period the differentiation of the two faunas took place.
At a still later period there was probably a partial subsidence of Central America allowing the passage of a few forms of the one region into the other.

Pedomorphism.
 Dr. Harrison Allen spoke of the disposition occasionally exhibited in adult mammals for the proportions of different parts of the body to remain as they were in the immature individuals.
He claimed for this peculiarity that it is not due to arrest of growth but to the fact that certain parts preserve the peculiarities of the young  thus for example among the bats the socalled species F. lucif ag lis exhihits a number of characteristics Avhich are found in the immature animal and which are the same in kind as those that exist in an individual which in every other respect answers to the description of the adult.
In young bats the foot and thumb are apt to be large as compared with the same parts in the adult at the same time that the auricle and tragus are correspondingly small and the snout high blunt and nearly naked.
Tlie parts often so remain.
Dr. Allen jroposed for this peculiarity the term jjedomorphism. 
V. luoifugus  becomes a pedoniorphic variety of V. subulatus.
It might be expected that pedomorpliic varieties closely resemble each other Avhen the same disposition is exhilited in closely allied species.
It is almost impossible to distinguish the pedomorjhic variety of V. mbulatus from that of V. nitidus or to express it differently the  T' lucifngus from the range of V. subulatus is an almost identical form with the  V. lucifugus  from the range of V. nitidus.
Some species exhibit the disposition to retain pedomorphic variation to a greater degree than others and it is held to be probably true that the existence of this disposition to so remarkable a degree in the North American species of Vespertilio accounts for the great confusion which has existed in this genus.
 Writers imply by their language that there is but one kind of variation namely tlie geographical.
It is an advantage to recognize two kinds namely the pedomorphic and the geographical.
