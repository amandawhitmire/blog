A REVIEW OF THE SPECIES OF THE GENUS ESOX.
BY SETH E. MEEK AND ROBERT NEWLAND.
In the present paper is given the synonymy of the species of the genns Esox, with an analytical key b} which the species can be determined.
The specimens which we have studied belong to the Indiana University.
We acknowledge our indebtedness to Professor Jordan, for the use of his library and for other aids.

1 The name Esox is in this paper restricted to Esox belone L., the type of the genus Belone Cuvier, while the name Lucius is reserved I'or the pikes.
The name Esox lias been universally associated with the Pikes rather than with the Gar-fishes, 1 ml perhaps in strict technicality, the name Lucius should be used for the former and that of Esox lor the latter.
It is perhaps not unfair, however, to assume that Linnaeus would have considered the Pike, rather than the Gar-fish, as typical of his genus Esox.

Habitat.
— Mississippi Valley and Great Lake region, most abundant in the central States.
Not found east of the Allegheny Mountains, nor in the Texan region.
Frequenting sluggish waters and bayous.
The specimens examined by us are from Falls of Ohio ; Ohio River, Southern Indiana ; Bean Blossom Creek, Monroe Co., Indiana : Pipe Creek, Madison County, Indiana; Mecca, Parke County, Indiana; Kankakee River at Riverside, Indiana, and Hieksville, Defiance County, Ohio.
This species lias the general coloration of E. reticulatus, with its other characters, very close to those of E. americanus.
From the latter species it differs but slightly, but the greater length of the snout, small as it is, seems to be very constant.
The name Esox salmoneus, frequently applied to this species, cannot be retained, as it was earlier given by Mitchill to Synodus fifpteus.
It is also probable that Rafinesque's original salmoneus ie a mythical species, not identifiable with anything.
In his copy of the original drawing (in his MSS.
note books i the insertion of the dorsal is said to be represented as midway between the tip of the snout and the base of the caudal.

— Streams and lakes of Europe ; Northern Asia, Alaska, and Northeastern parts of North America ; South to New York and Ohio River, and west to the Rocky Mountains.
The specimens examined by us are from Venice, Lake Erie, and Lake Michigan.
We can see no difference whatever between American and European examples of this species, when specimens of similar size and condition are compared.
The names Esox estor, deprandus, lucioides and boreus are therefore strictly synonymous with E. lucius.

Esox ohiensis Kirtland, "Cleveland Annals of Science, 1854."
Habitat.
— Great Lakes, occasionally in the Ohio and Upper Mississippi Rivers.
One specimen examined by us is from the Ohio River at New Albany, Indiana.
We here adopt the name Esox masquinongy of Mitchill for this species instead of the more familiar and preferable Esox nobilior of apparently later date.
Professor Jordan has been unable to find the description of Mitchill in the files of the Mirror, where it is said by De Kay to occur.
A portion of the description of Mitchill is quoted by De Kay, and this part applies to the Muskalunge much better than to the Pikes.
Moreover, reference to Mitchill's name is made by Kirtland at a date prior to the publication of the work of De Kaj\ It is therefore highly probable that a description of Esox masquinongy has been somewhere printed by Mitchill, and if so, that this is the earliest account of the Muskalunge.
The descriptions of Esox ohioensis is said to refer to this species, but we have not been able to examine the original paper of Dr. Kirtland.

Inflorescence of the Composite.
— At the meeting of the Botanical section, on the seventh inst., Mr. Thomas Meehan remarked that it seemed obvious, by the rule in Asteraceous plants, or the order Composite, that the order of anthesis was inversely to the growth.
But by a note of Prof. Asa Gray in his new synoptical Flora of North America, referring to Liatris, it did not appear to have received the marked attention of botanists.
Among the generic characters of Liatris, Dr. Gray gives flowering from the top downwards, as in an inverted spike or raceme.
He exhibited specimens of Mulgedium, Lactuca, Erecthites, Gnaphalium, Aster, Solidogo, Vernonia, Erigeron, Bidens, and Xanthium, all gathered casually and hastily within a few yards of each other, to show that the upper or terminal flower was the first to open, then the upper flower on the next branch of the raceme or panicle, and then the lower ones in succession.
If in these plants the side branches were arrested in their growth, and the terminal flowers of the branchlets brought down in proximity to the main stem, we had precisely the same kind of anthesis as in Liatris.
If Liatris had a branched panicle instead of a spicate inflorescence, we should not notice an}' difference between it and other plants.
There were some other families of plants that presented a similar order of anthesis, but it is so marked a character in Composite as to make it well worthy of consideration in connection with the peculiar construction of the flower heads.
A remarkable reflection is that this completion of growth, and their flowering down the stems backwards, ceases with the formation of the flower heads.
Then the anthesis of the florets is with and not reversely to the growth.
In a sunflower, for instance, any one may remember that the florets near the ray open first, and continue to open spirally until the centre is reached.
There were, however, exceptions in composite to the order of anthesis in the flower heads.
In Ambrosia the lower flowers on the spike opened first, and they continued to open upwards as in the raceme of any other order of plants.
In the female plants of Ambrosia artemisieefolia.
being abundant this season (1885) the truly racemose order of opening was the same as in the ordinary monoecious plants.

On the Pectoral Filaments in the Sea Robin (Primotus palmipes).
— Dr. Harrison Allen said, in speaking of the pectoral flu of the family of teliostean fishes, the Triglidce, that the first three rays are known as the pectoral filaments.
They are disposed ventrally, separated from the bod}' of the fin, and placed well in front of its base.
The filaments are curved somewhat upon themselves, and are moved by powerful muscles.
The nerves supplying them are derived from the ganglionic masses (so characteristic of the Triglidae) at the beginning of the spinal cord.
The filaments are used not only for touch but for locomotion.
In directing the body toward the right, the left filaments are in constant motion (like the limbs of a salamander) while the right filaments are at rest.
In directing the body toward the left, the motion thus described is reversed.
The filaments are also used in stirring up the soft silt which composes the bottoms on which the fish rests.
The organs are thus put to comparative rough usage, so that one learns with a sense of surprise that the tops and sides near the tips possess a high degree of differentiation of the tegument.
The organ, while appearing to be tactile in nature, recalls in character the general features of a retinal surface.
Both in longitudinal and in transverse section the organ is seen to be composed of four layers of cells.
The first basal laj-er is made up of small nearly round cells.
The second la} er is composed of large fusiform cells, each of which contains granular contents surrounding a distinct circular nucleus.
The third layer is composed of columnar cells resembling finger-like processes which arc arranged like a layer of retinal rods.
A connective tissue membrane which might be compared to the external limiting membrane of the retina intervenes between the third and second layer of cells.
The fourth and peripheral layer is composed of diaphanous tube-like prolongations of the side of the cells which compose the third layer.
It varies greatly in thickness.
In some portions of each filament the fourth layer is very thin, and barely covers the tips of the processes of the third layer, or it is of a thickness nearly equal to one-half the thickness of the entire organ.
The layer appears to be tightly held to the third, and is often detached in the sections.
The general membrane is smooth and uniform at the tips of the filaments, but is arranged in broad capitate papillae elsewhere.
The recorder thought the pectoral filaments to be beautiful objects for study.
They can be readily obtained since the searobin is a common summer fish along the Atlantic coast.

Notes on Gactaceee.
— Elastic Fruit in Mamillaria.
— At the meeting of the Botanical Section of the Academy, held on the 12th inst., Mr. Meehan referred to his former observations on the sudden growth of the fruit of some species of cactacese, indicating that it was not a growth before maturity, but an elastic projection of a fruit already mature.
Since that time he had been able to note in Mamillaria gladiata, M. recurva, and some other Mexican species, in which there was only the apex of the red fruit visible between the mamma over night, a full elongation to the length of an inch by 9 A. M. the next day.
They were clear cases of the elongation of the fruit after maturity and not a growth.
The (lowers of Opuntia Rafinesqui had very irritable stamens when the Mowers were fully expanded under a bright sun.
Some echinocacti had stamens irritable in a less degree, but in Echinocactus efinaceus the stamens were quite as irritable as in the opuntia noted.
On the Flora of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.^-At the ~.niie meeting of the Botanical Section Mr. Redfield spoke of the topographical features of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, in connection with the flora of those islands.
The northern portion of the island of Martha's Vineyard rises into rounded hills of considerable elevation, composed of gravelly drift, strewn occasionally with large boulders.
The}' are evidently of glacial origin.
The more central portion consists of level plains of gravel, covered with oaks, mostly Quercus oblusiloba.
The general character of the flora is much like that found on the summit of the divides in southern New Jersey, though much move limited as to species.
Farther south, extensive ponds, both of fresh and salt water, introduce their characteristic vegetation.
In Nantucket he had* found the gravelly hills of much less height, the greater portion of the island consisting in fact of treeless plains — one extensive grove of Pinus rigida exists in the central portion of the island, and is known to have been planted.
The plains alluded to were many years ago occupied as sheep pastures.
But of late years this has been prohibited, and it is said that since then there has been a great change in the character of the vegetation.
The most characteristic plant of these plains seemed to be Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, which grows there in greater profusion than he had ever seen it.
The two species of Hudsonia abound, the H. ericoides being seen everywhere, and less frequently the more bluish-green tufts of H. tomentosa.
Polygala jjolygama, Myrica cerifera and various Vaccinese abound.
He saw many large patches of Gorema Conradii, the existence of which in Nantucket had first been made known by Mrs. Owen of Springfield, Mass.
But the most interesting feature is the existence here of three species of heath, possibly indigenous.
Mrs. Owen, who published a preliminary catalogue of the Nantucket flora a few years ago, records Galluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea as found upon the island.
The first of these had long been known to occur at Tewksbury, Mass., and there had been some question as to whether its presence there was due to human agenc} r .
Its subsequent discovery in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland had seemed to strengthen the idea of its indigenous character.
Mr. R. did not see the locality of Galluna vulgaris, but had the privilege of seeing that of the Erica cinerea.
This plant had been known and watched for 10 or 12 3'ears, and is evidently an old one.
It grows in the open common — far away from the town — and there is nothing about its surroundings to indicate human introduction.
It covers only a space of eight inches by ten.
Since Mr. Redfield's visit the third species Erica tetralix had been discovered in a locality very distant from that of E. cinerea, but under circumstances which favor the idea of its accidental introduction in connection with the importation of foreign trees.
But there are said to be seven or eight of the plants all thriving, large, and bushy.

The Committee appointed to settle the estate of the late Henry N. Johnson, under whose will dated March 5, 1878, the Academy is made residuary legatee after the death of his wife, reported that Mrs. Elizabeth Johnson had died February 21, 1885, that the estimated value of the entire estate amounts to $51,761.40, and that the present income from the productive portion, less taxes and water rent, is $1434.82.
The following resolution was unanimously adopted : — Resolved, That the thanks of the Academy are herebjr tendered to Mr. Jacob Binder and to Uselma C. Smith, Esq., the Solicitor of the Academy, for their careful and laborious services in the matter of the Johnson estate.
The following was ordered to be printed : — BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF HENRY N. JOHNSON.
BY THOMAS MEEHAN.
In the central part of Germantown, on what is known as " The battle-ground," is " Upsal," the estate of John Johnson, the descendant of Dirk Jansen, an early settler in that borough.
The residence is some five hundred feet west of the celebrated Chew Mansion, in which a number of British troops fortified themselves in the war of the Revolution to resist the advance of General Washington's army towards Philadelphia.
In front of John Johnson's house the cannon were placed that were used by the American army in the attack on the Chew House.
The estate was known as " Upsal," a name associated with the great Swedish botanist Linnaeus ; but in this case given from its being the birthplace of Mrs. John Johnson.
A love of* botany, or at least of rare trees and plants, must have been a trait in the character of John Johnson, for when the writer first knew it, about 1856, it was, in many regards, a botanic garden, in respect to the number of rare herbaceous plants growing there, while some of the finest specimens of rare trees to be found about the city, adorned the grounds.
At that time it contained a specimen of the European silver fir, which the writer measured and found over ninety feet high ; a very large deciduous cypress, by examining which the late Dr. Engelmann made his first discovery of the fact that at least one coniferous plant imitated amentaceous plants in advancing considerably male flower buds in the fall ; magnolias, and especially a specimen of the American yew, which remains to this day probably the finest specimen of this plant in the world.
These trees, according to the statement of Henry >»., the son and subject of this sketch, were planted by John Johnson about the year 1800.
Henry N. was born on the 20th of May, 1820.
He completed his education in the old Germantown Academy in 1839.
He was noted among his schoolmates for a studious disposition, and in the classics, literature, and mathematics, particularly, kept at the head of his class.
Entering manhood he started, in connection with a friend, the business of a bookseller, on Chestnut Street, near Seventh, in Philadelphia, which was ultimately abandoned.
A physical infirmity which afflicted him from birth, rendered him averse to city life, and after declining business, he took on himself the care of the estate — the garden, especially, receiving his special attention.
Physically strong, he loved to apply himself to garden work, and a large number of rare trees and plants were added from time to time, and set out with his own hands.
Some of the finest specimens of the Japan cedar — Cryptomeria Japonica — are here, and the only known plant of the mammoth Sequoia in existence around Philadelphia.
The tree, although not seeming to like our hot summers, is growing here in fair health — all from his planting and care.
He would have disclaimed the title of botanist, but his love for trees and plants, and the great amount of knowledge he possessed regarding them, was very unusual in a mere lover of gardening.
He always took great interest in the progress of natural history, and, in conversation with the writer, subjects connected with the Academy of Natural Sciences, showing an interest in its welfare, were frequent topics.
He continued his interest in the oversight of the family estate till about 1865, when it was divided, and he took his separate share.
About this time he married a lady of Philadelphia with whom he had been long acquainted, and went to housekeeping on Guard Avenue, near Fairmount Park, in which beautiful spot, among the trees and flowers, he would spend most of his time.
He died on the 30th of August, 1879, leaving the use of all he was possessed of to his wife during her lifetime, and to revert to the Academy on her decease.

Virulence of the Common Parsnip.
— Mr. Meehan referred to the deaths of some children, at Danville, Pa., in the spring of 1884, reputed to be caused by eating the roots of the wild parsnip.
This was usually understood to mean the roots of Cicuta maculata, or perhaps Conium maculatum.
Roots had been sent to him by the attendant physician, among which was the fragment of a portion that one of the dead children had partially eaten, with teeth marks on the remains.
There seemed no chance for error in this case.
The root, which was evidently neither of the two reputed to be virulent, was planted.
It proved to be the true garden parsnip.
Pdstinaca sativa, which has become an escape from gardens in many parts of the United States.
Although the evidence that the deaths were from the wild roots of the common garden parsnip appeared so conclusive, in view of the fact that there seems to be no record of such a virulent character in connection with this plant, it was thought possible there might still be some mistake, and corroborative evidence was sought for.
It was found that in the cultivated form some growers are careful about weeding or working among the leaves while the dew is on them, as severe cases of poisoning have been known to result, and on large seed farms, the workmen engaged in cutting the stalks at the seed harvest, have to protect their hands and arms against contact with the juices, or they are liable to be severely poisoned in a manner similar to that from the poison vine Rhus toxicodendron.
With these facts it seems worth placing on record what seems to be indisputable that the deaths of the Danville children were really caused by the wild garden parsnip, Pastinaca sativa.

The Shape of the Hind Limb in the Mammalia as Modified bxj the Weight of the Trunk.
— Dr. Harrison Allen directed attention to the osseous characters of the posterior extremities in mammals, as determined by the weight borne.
The shape of the hind limb in the majority of the forms is that best adapted for sustaining the weight of the hinder part of the trunk.
The head of the femur lies upon a neck which is relatively long ; the shaft is cylindroid, and the condylar end is expanded in all its diameters, but notably in its posterior diameter.
Were a section of the condyles made by extending downward the plane of the posterior surface of the femur, the condyles would be removed in such manner as to retain in the removed segment the base of the inter-condyloid notch.
If, however, the parts named be examined in the sloth, in the genus Gylosthurus (the two-toed arboreal ant-eater), in the bat and in the seal, the head of the femur is seen to be without a neck, or to possess a very small one.
The shaft of the femur is flattened, and the condylar end is scarcely at nil expanded.
If a section be made as above described, the base of the condyloid notch is not removed with the section.
The bone in its general features resembles the femur of the embryo.
The fibula in the genera bearing the weight of the body, exhibits two forms, one in which the bone is parallel to the tibia, and nearly equal to it in length, and a second in which the distal end is either anchylosed to the shaft of the tibia or is obliterated.
In the genera which are suspended by the feet, or are otherwise free from the sustenance of weight, the fibula, when it departs from the type in which it is separate from, but co-equal with the tibia, is always reduced at the proximal end.
In the seal the proximal end is anchylosed to the shaft of the tibia; in the bat the proximal end is entirely absent ; in the sloth the proximal end, while free, is small, while the distal end is broad and highly specialized in function.
The astragalus is flattened and irregular in the t} r pes whose posterior extremities sustain weight, but in those free from such weight it is elongated.
The tendency is seen in Galago and Tarsuis, for both calcaneum and astragalus are seen to be elongated, but the tendency is carried to an extreme degree in the sloth, the bat, and in l'hoca vitulina.
The manner of articulation in the gorilla of the fibula, with both the calcaneum and the astragalus, was dwelt upon, as well as the fact that the astragalus in that genus possesses a broad deflected fibular facet.
This peculiar projection is rudimental in the astragalus of the skeleton of civilized man, but was found highly developed in an astragalus from an Indian grave found at Cooper's Point, New Jersey.
