COSTA RICAN LAND AND FRESHWATER MOLLUSKS.
BY HENRY A. PILSBRY.
The moUusks enumerated below were collected by Dr. Philip P. Calvert and Mrs. (Amelia S.) Calvert in the year of their residence in Costa Rica, from May, 1909, to May, 1910.'
As their chief object was to study life histories and transformations of tropical dragonflies, other material was taken only when encountered in the course of this pursuit.
Much of their field work was done in districts where Prof. Paul Biolley^ and H. Pittier had collected shells, yet some eight species new to Costa Rica were found, five of them new to science.
This large proportion, in a total of 28 species taken, is evidence that our knowledge of the fauna is still very incomplete, though as von Martens remarks, it is "one of the best known within Central America."
Biolley has carefully recorded the elevation of localities where he collected shells, and some additions to this subject are now made; but on tabulating the data it appears that so many species are known from few localities, or but one, that conclusions as to zonal distribution would be too crude to have value.
Some species have a wide vertical range; the apparent restriction of others in the same districts may probably be due to deficient collecting.
Costa Rica is known as farthest north for a number of characteristically South American genera, such as Lahyrinthus, Solaropsis and Marisa.
The Brazilian genus Uncancylus, now reported, is an interesting addition to this series.

105285, A. N. S. P. The shell is minutely perforate, globosely conic, very fragile, light yellow; outlines of the spire are perceptibly concave, the periphery bluntly carinate.
The surface is very glossy, marked with weak growth-wrinkles, and under the microscope a very fine, close, vertical striation and minute spiral lines almost equally close are seen on the second to fourth whorls, very weak on the fourth.
The apex is rather acute.
The whorls are strongly convex; base very convex, impressed around the oblique perforation.

Guppya c. elatior.
This species is closely related to G. trochulina (Morel.
), of which Helix selenkai Pfr.
has been shown to be a synonym.''
It differs by the slightly concave outlines of the spire, the greater convexity of the individual whorls, the higher first whorl and the microscopic sculpture, the vertical striae being much more distinct and the spirals closer.
In topotypes of selenkai from Dr. Berendt, the original collector, the spirals are far more widely spaced (as noted by von Martens also for a paratype of trochulina) , and they continue on the last whorl, while the vertical striation is so weak that it has not been noticed by any of the authors who have treated of trochulina or selenkai.
The Canal Zone species of this group, Guppya hrowni Pils., has the straight contour of trochulina, but it differs by the very distinct and beautiful microscopic sculpture.

Type and paratypes, No.
105277, A. N. S. P. The shell is oval, moderately elevated, the altitude half the width, the apex acute, recurved or hooked, at the posterior fourth of the length and about half way between the median line and the right margin.
The anterior and left slopes are convex above, nearly straight near the margins; posterior strongly concave, the right slope much less so.
Isabella colored, rather opaque, not glossy.
Sculpture of many raised striae radiating from the summit, a few in the middle, anteriorly, coarse, the rest fine and narrow; on the sides and behind they are scarcely to be seen except by transmitted light.
The interior has a translucent-whitish layer.
Length 7.4, width 4.6, alt.

Ancyckis conccntricus Orb., which appears to be nearly related, is less symmetrical in contour, with the apex further towards the right, and with about the same length it is more elevated.
Ancyclus radiatus Guilding,^ which is known to me only from Guilding's account, resembles A. calverti in sculpture, but it is narrower relative to the length, if Guilding's figures are accurate; moreover, the apical part is not abruptly narrowed near the tip, as it is in XJ .
calverti.
Practically all authors who have considered the question agree in considering A. excentricus Morel, identical with A. radiatus.
The former is a well known species, quite distinct from U. calverti.
The writer is indebted to Dr. Bryant Walker for reviewing the determination of this species, and indicating differences from A. radiatus.
He also called attention to an error in H. & A. Adams, "Genera of Recent Mollusca", II, p. 265, pi.
84, fig.
5, said to represent A. radiatus, but really copied from one of Guilding's figures of A. irroratus.
This mistake has been perpetuated in the works of Bourguignat and Clessin.
The genus Uncancylus is new to North America.
The known species are chiefly Brazilian.
It was proposed for South American Ancyli with the spire strongly hooked towards the right side, the shell therefore sinistral.

8 [Jan., This species is closely related in shell characters to the type of the genus Uncancylus.
Since the teeth are unknown in that and other groups of South American Ancylidae, and the system of the family, as developed by Dr. Bryant Walker, is largely based upon the modes of specialization of the teeth, its dentition becomes of interest.

Left and upper figures, U. calverti.
Right and lower figures, U. ameliae.
In U. calverti there are 21-1-21 teeth in nearly straight transverse rows.
The central tooth is bicuspid, the cusps very short, deeply separated.
The laterals have three major cusps, the entocone and mesocone more or less united; between them and the ectocone there is a minute accessory cusp.
Outside of the ectocone there is a minute cusp in the inner laterals, then two, and in the middle teeth of the lateral series, four or five little cusps.
In some teeth a minute cusp appears between mesocone and entocone, and in the median and outer laterals another arises on the inner side of the entocone.
The laterals are rather widely spaced, more so towards the edges of the radula.
The basal plates are shorter than the cusps and very indistinct.

The jaw is long, slender, of wide, very short plates and with no lateral processes.
On comparison with the series of illustrations of Ancylid teeth prepared by Walker it is obvious that Uncancylus is closely related ito the African genus Burnupia Walker.
Except for the greater development of small accessoiy cusps in the American species there is no material difference.
No North American genus has similar teeth.

(No abstract.)
The report of the Committee on the Hayden Memorial Award conferring the gold medal on Professor Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin, Ph.D., LL.D., Sc.D., of the University of Chicago, was unanimously adopted.
Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin was born in Mattoon, Illinois, September 25, 1843.
He graduated from Beloit College in 1866, and received the degree of A.M. at the same institution in 1869.
He pursued graduate studies at the University of Michigan from 1868 to 1869; he received the degree of Ph.D. from the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin in 1882.
He received the degree of LL.D.
from the University of Michigan, Beloit College, and George Washington University in 1887; from the University of Wisconsin in 1904; and from L^niversity of Toronto in 1913.
He received the degree of Sc.D.
from the University of Illinois in 1905.
Doctor Chamberlin married, in 1867, Miss Alma Isabel Wilson, and has one son, who is now Professor Rollin T. Chamberlin, of the Geological Department of the University of Chicago Doctor Chamberlin w-as principal of the State Normal School, Delavan, Wisconsin, from 1866 to 1868, and was Professor of Natural Sciences at the State Normal School, Whitewater, Wisconsin, from 1869 to 1873.
He was Professor of Geology at Beloit College from 1873 to 1882, and at George Washington University from 1885 to 1887.
In 1887, he was elected President of the University of Wisconsin, which position he held until 1892, when he was appointed Professor of Geology and Head of the Department of Geology, and Director of the Walker Museum at the University of Chicago.
Doctor Chamberlin has carried on a vast amount of geologic research in a remarkably wide range of subjects.
He was Assistant State Geologist of Wisconsin from 1873 to 1876, and Director of the Geological Survey of Wisconsin from 1876 to 1882.
During this time he produced the series of volumes entitled "The Geology of Wisconsin," which at once became the standard work on the geology of that region and is recognized the world over as of very great importance to the science of geology.
In 1878, he represented the State of Wisconsin at the Paris Exposition.
During some years following this time, Doctor Chamberlin was largely engaged in researches in glacial geology, in which he was recognized as the chief authority in America.
In 1878, he visited the glaciers of Switzerland; from 1882 to 1907 he was United States Geologist in charge of the Glacial Division of the United States Geological Survey; he was geologist of the Peary Relief Expedition in 1894.
Somewhat later, Doctor Chamberlin became associated with the Carnegie Institution of Washington in research work; was a member of the University of Chicago Oriental Educational Investigation Committee in 1909; was Commissioner of the Illinois Geological Survey; and held many other positions.
He was the recipient of medals at Paris in 1878 and 1893 in honor of his scientific work; and the Helen Culver Medal of the Chicago Geographical Society was bestowed on him in 1910.
He is a corresponding member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and of the London and the Edinburgh geological societies.
After Doctor Chamberlin had gone to the University of Chicago he took up actively the investigation of some of the most fundamental problems of geology, the planetesimal hypothesis, the early history of the earth, the history of the atmosphere and other profound researches, and he is today recognized as the foremost scholar in the study of the fundamental principles governing the earth's origin and structure.
He has written widely on this subject, both in the publications of the Carnegie Institution and elsewhere, and a remarkable volume produced a few years ago by him and entitled "The Origin of the World" shows his wonderfully clear conception of the subject.
In addition to the publications already mentioned, Doctor Chamberlin has for over fifty years been a voluminous writer in all the departments of geology to which he has given his attention.
The "General Treatise on Geology," written by him and Professor R. D. Salisbury, is recognized as the standard text-book of geology in this country and abroad; and the wonderful ability with which he and Professor Salisbury have edited the Journal of Geology has commanded the admiration and respect of all their associates in the geological profession.
Professor Chamberlin is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and many other scientific organizations.
He was President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1908; President of the Chicago Academy of Sciences in 1898 to 1914; and President of the Illinois Academy of Science in 1907.
He is at present Professor Emeritus of Geology at the University of Chicago.
