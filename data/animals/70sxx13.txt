BIRDS OF THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO A COLLECTION MADE BY MR. LINDSEY L. JEWEL.
BY WITMER STONE.
Through the generosity of several of its members the Academy of Natural Sciences has come into possession of a collection of some four hundred ])ird skins obtained by the late Ijindsey Louin Jewel in the Canal Zone, Panama.
Mr.
Jewel was stationed in the Zone from late in 1910 to the earty part of 1913, engaged in engineering work, and had also been appointed Vice-Consul at Colon.
His beautifully prepared skins are accompanied by numerous notes on the habits, nests and eggs of many of the species.
Unfortunately these do not cover all of the species, his death having prevented his return to the Zone, where he had hoped to complete his study of the bird life.
They have, however, been used so far as they go in the following list, and as all the field notes, coloration of the soft points and description of the eggs and nests are to be credited to Mr.
Jewel, it was thought unnecessary to make use of quotation marks; moreover, as there was frequently duplication in notes referring to several specimens of the same species, verbatim quotation was not practicable.
Some few of Mr.
Jewel's notes refer to specimens which were sent to the American Museum of Natural History, but they have been included wherever the species was unrepresented in the collection, Mr. W. DeW.
Miller having kindly sent me a list of such specimens.
Mr.
Jewel published an annotated list of the North American birds observed by him during his stay on the isthmus in The Auk, 1913, pp.
422-429, with a brief introduction describing the condition of the Zone at the time his collection was made, but did not identify anj^ of the resident species.
Some brief mention of his work and a list of birds of the Zone compiled by him from Ridgway's "Birds of North and Middle America" appeared in The Canal Record for January 28, 1914, pp.
219-220.
We have no record of a collection of birds having been made on the isthmus until 1847, when Lafresnaye described a number of specimens obtained there by DeLattre, a French collector, who was on his way to South America.
This collection was purchased by Dr. Thomas B. Wilson and is still preserved in this Academy, along with Dr. Wilson's other material.
(Revue Zoologique, 1847, pp.
67-79.)
No further collections were made in the Canal Zone so far as we are aware until the late fifties, when James McLeannan, of New York, who was stationed on the isthmus, began sending specimens to George N. Lawrence, who described them in the Annals of the New York Lyceum of Natural History and other scientific journals, issuing a final catalogue in three instalments.
(Ann.
N. Y. Lye.
Vol.
VII, 1861-2, pp.
288-302, 315-334, 461-479, and Vol.
VIII, pp.
294-360.)
During the winter of 1860-61 John R. Galbraith, son of William Galbraith, a well-known New York taxidermist, went to Panama and aided McLeannan in collecting for Mr. Lawrence.
Some 390 species in all were obtained by the two collectors and their specimens are now in the American Museum of Natural History.
In March, 1863, the noted British ornithologist, Osbert Salvin, visited McLeannan and in that year and later extensive collections were made for him and sent to England, all of which are now in the British Museum with the rest of the Salvin collection.
An account of the collections sent to him by McLeannan is published by Mr. Salvin in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1864, pp.
342-373, and covers 272 species.
From his introduction we learn that at the time of his visit McLeannan was trackmaster at Lion Hill (Loma del Leon) station on the Panama Railway, the second station after leaving Colon and about ten miles from the coast.
It was situated ' 'in the densest tropical forest, so wet that even in the dry season the trails were confined to the low hills, the swamps being impenetrable."
Now we learn from Mr.
Jewel that this famous locality is swallowed up in Gatun Lake.
In 1895, the Italian ornithologist Festa made a considerable collection at Punta de Sabana, Darien, and incidentally recorded a few species from Colon and Panama city.
In March, 1900, Mr. W. W. Brown, Jr., spent twenty-eight days at Loma del Leon, collecting for Mr. Outram Bangs, and secured 752 skins representing 148 species.
He also secured a collection of 86 species in the vicinity of Panama city on the Pacific side of the isthmus, where the country is much drier with a scrubby growth.
At the same time that Mr.
Jewel was making his collection Mr. E. A. Goldman visited the isthmus in the interests of the United States Biological Survey, but with the exception of descriptions of some new species obtained by him his collection has not yet been reported upon.
Mr.
Jewel's collection represents 236 species and was made mainly at Gatun, some three miles north of the historic Loma del Leon.
Other localities where he collected were Agua Clara, Mindi and Mt.
Hope, between Gatun and Colon; Toro Point, across the harbor from the latter city, and Ft. Lorenzo on the sea front just west of the Zone border.
A few specimens were also secured at Tabernilla, almost half way across the isthmus, and at Pedro Miguel and Miraflores, nearer to Panama.
While the ornithology of the Canal Zone is supposed to be pretty well known, every large collection from the region contains a few species not hitherto reported, and in view of the increased interest in the country due to the opening of the canal it has seemed desirable to add to my report on Mr.
Jewel's collection the names of such other species as have been recorded from the region, so that we may have a complete list of the avifauna.
In making this compilation, in addition to the papers above quoted, the "British Museum Catalogue of Birds"; "Biologia CentraliAmericana" and Ridgway's "Birds of l^orth and Middle America" have been consulted.
It is possible that a few of the species recorded do not occur in the Canal Zone, as in some cases "Panama" has been understood as referring to the city while it may have been intended to denote the isthmus in general.
From the light that Dr. Frank M. Chapman has thrown upon the distribution of neotropical bird life in his "Distribution of Bird Life in Colombia" we now recognize the importance of what he terms "the Panama fault" and realize that many species are absent from the Canal Zone and its immediate vicinity which occur in the mountains of Chiriqui to the west and in the highlands of eastern Panama.
As Chapman has shown, the subtropical and higher life zones are entirely lacking in the lower country of the Canal Zone, so that only the tropical fauna remains; subtropical species, therefore, which are usually quoted as occurring from Costa Rica to Ecuador have a gap in their range coextensive with the low ground of the isthmus.
In the list which follows the species not contained in the Jewel collection are placed in their proper sj'stematic position, but have their numbers enclosed in brackets.
North American migrants are marked with an asterisk.

This species was described by Mr. Hellmayr (Bull.

Club, xix, p. 62, 1907) from a Trinidad specimen collected by Dr. F. M. Chapman and recorded by him as C. cinereicauda Cassin (Bull.
Amer.

Hist., 1895, p. 324).
Before describing it as distinct Mr. Hellmayr sent me a specimen of this and allied forms for comparison with Cassin's type.
As he has stated, I found Cassin's specimen to be identical with C. hrachyura (Jardine).
At the same time I found a specimen of the proposed C. chapmani in the Academy collection, and a comparison of this with the Panama specimens before me positively confirms mj^ identification.
This extends the range of the species northward, as it was previously known only from Trinidad and French Guiana according to Hellmayr.

They seldom ^y ov^er twelve inches from the ground, usually under the foliage, darting al^out like bees.
They are very noisy, chirping constantly one note at a time and then several rapid notes of varying pitch.
This sounds so like several birds that I have more than once crept close and looked long to find a single individual perched on a leaf stem a few inches from the ground, beating his little tail up and down as though he would break himself in two and chirping away for dear life.
Once I saw one leave a leaf stem about eight inches from the ground and hanging on invisible wings revolve around and around as if he were a weight suspended at the end of a thread, first one way and then the other as if winding and unwinding.
Then with great energy he flew in a figure eight back and forth over the same path, and the figure was not over eighteen inches long.

It seems to the writer that it will be necessary to revert to the generic name Amazilia Lesson for these birds.
When Dr. Oberholser proposed to adopt Amizilis Gray (Proc.
Acad.
Nat.
Sci.
Phila., 1899, p. 206) he asked me to verify some references for him and through a misunderstanding a quotation from Gray's large work, "Genera of Birds," was quoted as from his "List of Genera of Birds, 1840."
This, however, does not affect the main question and is mentioned in order to correct an obvious error for which I am mainly responsible.
The generic name Amizilis does occur in Gray's 1840 "List" as correctly quoted in the IgflO edition of the "A. O. U. Check-List," i. e., p. 14, with the following as its basis: A. latirostris (Sw.) n. Ois.
M., pi.
12.
Or.
amizili Less.
The A. O. U. committee accepted Orthorhynchus amizili Less, as the type on the basis of Gray's use of it alone in his 1855 edition of the "List."
As a matter of fact, in all editions of the "List" we find on the title page "with an indication of the typical species of each genus'' and the citation of a species in any edition is rightly regarded as a type designation for the genus under which it is quoted.
Where two names are cited as above the second is obviously intended as a synonym of the first and is usually a reference to a plate or figure of the species.
Gray's own statement on the title page, moreover, proves that he was citing but a single species under each genus.
In the present case he misidentified the Cynanthus latirostris of Swainson, thinking it the same as Orthorhynchus amizili Lesson, and did not correct his error until the 1855 edition.
Upon this basis C. latirostris becomes the type of Amizilis Gray, 1840, which, therefore, becomes a synonym of Cynanthus Swainson, 1827.
Amazilia Lesson, L'Echo du Monde Sav.
ser.
2, viii, No.
32, Oct. 22, 1843, col. 757, seems to be the first name available for the present genus.
Mr. Ridgway (Birds of N. and Mid-America, vol.
V, p. 405) quotes five species as mentioned by Lesson, and of these I would designate Ornismia cinnamomea Less.
( = 0. rutila DeLattre) as the type of Amazilia Lesson.
